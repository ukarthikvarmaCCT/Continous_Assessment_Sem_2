, some of the useless buses of the Municipal Corporation were changed and given the form of a colorful toilet bus

 tivi kii jaani-maani actress divyanka treepathi ne apane real life baliye ke saath naam nach baliye sijan 8 kaa khitaab apane naam kar liya he
 Divyanka and Vivek were married in July last year
 divyanka ne apane instagram par apni vidaai kaa ek video share kiya he
 But by watching this farewell video, you will not be able to shed your tears but will not stop laughing
 is video main divyanka or vivek bhopal airport par hai
 Where his family has come to see him off and is performing the farewell ritual
 jab baat aati he rone kii to divyanka rone kaa naatak karti hai or phir vivek mazaakia andaaj main unhen chup karaane aate hai
 While sharing the video, Divyanka wrote in the caption that Vivek, do you remember this day? Even on that day, there was strong rain like today
 ghar se meri vidaai hone vaali thi
 But due to rain and flood, the farewell could not be done
 isi vajah se hamen is ocoverd airport par vidaai kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 divyanka-vivek won Nach Baliye, received so many lakhs of prizes in prize, you remember this day? It was raining heavily like today
 i wanted my Bidai from home
 
 
 but we couldn't reach there due to rains and floods
 That lead to this awkward airport Bidai
 It was unique and filmy! No one cried that day
 Generally a sad affair turned out to be funny and joyous! Things don't always happen the way you plan and imagine but life writes a more beautiful story for you than you can
 Best chapters are written on you when you don't resist the change and go with the flow! # gettingnostalgic # romanceinair Falling in love with you again @vivekdahiya
 a post shared by Divyanka Tripathi Dahiya (@divyankatripathidahiya) onjun 25, 2017 at 1:32am pdtbawa den ki nach baliye sijan 8 kaa khitaab divyanka ne apane pati or tivi actor vivek dahia ke saath milakar jeeta he
 Divyanka and Vivek, who are also fondly known as Divek, were loved by the audience since the beginning of the show which started in April
 haalanki phinale se pehle un par sho ke nateezon ko fiks karne kaa aarope bhi laga tha
 So due to this Bharti Singh was not part of the finale of Nach Baliye, who won the finale of Nach Baliye, defeating pairs like Abigail pandey-sanam Johar (first Runner Up) and irani-mohit Sehgal

 mahangaai thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi he or aise main ghar sanbhaalanaa mushkil hota ja rahaa he
 House rent, children's fees, petrol, EMI and other similar bills, nothing remains in the name of savings at the end of the month
 aise main seaving kii baat sochna bhi mushkil jaan padataa he lekin agar aap smart shopping karnaa jaanati hai to yakeen maniye kuch bachat aap kar hi lengi
 Although everyone has their own way of shopping, but these are some ways by which you can increase your savings: 1
 kharidari par jane se pehle list bana lenlist banaakar kharidari karnaa ek behatar vikalp he
 We often buy things that we do not even need by going shopping without making a list
 2
 Thinking of a budget from home is now the era of credit cards
 credit card seshoppingkarne ke dauraan hamen kharche kaa andaja nahin rahata
 In such a situation, it would be better that we make a rough estimate of the expenditure from home and go shopping with cash
 3
 Become Smart: Today, mega stores are in vogue, where various offers continue to run
 masalan, ek ke saath ek free yaa phir chhot
 If you see such offers before taking any goods, then they should be selected
 4
 Avoid showing off
 aisa nahin sochna chahie ki branded chijen hi sabase acchhee hoti he or agar aapane vahi cheez local market se le lee to aapaki beijjati ho jaaegi
 Many times it happens that we buy goods from the mega-store, while the same goods are available in the local market at half the price
 5
 Do not be seen - many times it happens that we like some things in the homes of others and we decide to make them part of our house
 ye kai baar galat bhi ho saktaa he
 It is not necessary that the stuff which looks good in other's house, should also enhance your home
 dekha-dekhi kisi maamle main sahi nahin or shopping bhi usase juda nahin he

 He said that the situation in Kashmir is very good and not a single bullet was fired there
 india today or ajtak ke news diarector rahul kanwal ke saath baatcheet main unhone kai muddon par raay rakhi
 When asked if everything is fine in Kashmir, then why were former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti kept in lockup? On this, the Home Minister said, when an incident is fresh, the act of provocation is not right
 370 hataae jane ke baad 4 hajaar logon ko ehtiyaat ke taur par hiraasat main liya gaya
 Of that, less than 1 thousand are in jail today

 On the road map ahead of development on Kashmir, Amit Shah said, 370 could not develop in Jammu and Kashmir, corruption was enough
 isaki jimmedaari kisi kii bhi tay nahin thi
 After 370 withdrawals, development will reach there at the bottom
 grih mantri amit shah kii do took- maharashtra ke agle CM devendra fadanvis hi hongamit shah se jab poocha gaya ki 370 hataai gai to kaha gaya ki patharbaji hogi, jabardast virodh hoga or aatanki hamalaa bhi lekin mushkilen aain lekin zyada virodh nahin dekha gaya
 To this, he said, Parliament was told that there would be bloodshed, not riots
 370 se jammu-kashmir kii janata kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 The selfishness of some leaders was related to this
 unhone kaha ki 370 hataane ko lekar duniya bharat ke paksh main rahi or mana ki yah bharat kaa aantarik masalaa he
 He described it as a big diplomatic victory of the Narendra Modi government

 But do you know why mother Durga rides a lion? How did her vehicle become a lion? Maa Durga is a symbol of speed, strength and power and her ride is a lion
 sher pratik he aakraamakata or shaury kaa
 These three characteristics are also seen in the conduct of Maa Durga
 yah bhi rochak he ki sher kii dahaad ko maa durga kii dhwani hi mana jaataa he jiske aage sansar kii baaki sabhi awaajen kamjor lagati hai
 Let us know why the lion is the vehicle of Maa Durga and what is the story behind it? According to the first story-legend, once in the Mount Kailash, Parvati and Shivji were sitting together and joking with each other
 majaak main hi shivaji ne maa parvati ko kaali kah diya
 Mother Parvati felt very bad and she left Mount Kailash and went to the forest and she became engrossed in severe penance
 is bich ek bhookha sher maa parvati ko khaane kii ichha se vahaan pahunchaa, lekin vah vahiin chupchaap baith gaya
 Due to the influence of the mother, that lion also sat quietly with the mother doing penance there for years
 maa ne jid kar lee thi ki jab tak vah gori nahin ho jaaengi tab tak vah yaheen tapasya karengi
 Then Shiva appeared there and left the goddess with the boon of being a blonde
 phir mata ne nadi main snaan kiya or baad main dekha kii ek sher vahaan chupchaap baitha mata ko dhyaan se dekh rahaa he
 When Goddess Parvati came to know that this lion had been sitting here with her for a long time in austerities, Mother was pleased and made her her vehicle as a boon
 tab se maa parvati kaa vaahan sher ho gaya
 The second story is the second story in this connection, which is mentioned in the Skanda Purana
 iske anusaar shiv ke putr kartikeya ne devasur sangram main daanav tarak or uske do bhai singhmukham or suraapdaman ko parajeet kiya

 You may have problems sleeping due to bipolar disorder
 depressant or thakaan hona bhi aam baat he
 2
 is rog se padit vyakti kaa vyavhaar chidchida ho jaataa he
 Both insanity and depression can occur simultaneously in a person suffering from bipolar disorder
 choti-choti baton main chidchida ho janaa bhi iskaa ek lakshan he

 bipolar disorder se peedit vyakti ko sochane main bhi pareshaani hoti he
 They cannot think of anything that causes them to forget
 4

 Such people are not able to come out of depression due to the use of alcohol, but become victims of bipolar disorder
 8
 Spending a lot of money on useless things is also a common symptom of this disease
 vyakti soch hi nahin paata ki vah kya kar rahaa he
 Personality Disorders: This disease may be behind repeated fingers licking 9
 khaanaa na khaanaa bhi is beemaari kaa lakshan he
 Such patients also eat very little due to irritability

 ) Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Friday that more and more volunteers will be included in the organization in the coming days
 unhone kaha ki desh main raajnneeti paridrishy chaahe jo bhi ho, RSS gramin ilaakon se zyada se zyada swayamsevakon ko sanghathan main shaamil karne ke silsile ko jari rakhega
 In the inaugural session of the two-day 'samrasata Sangam' organized by the Sangh, the RSS chief appealed to the volunteers to go to the villages and asked to join more youth youth organizations
 unhone swayamsevakon se baithkon ke dauraan sangh kii ganavesh (uniform) main aane kii apil kii
 He said that 8 registration centers have been established in this district of 45 lakh people, where uniforms are being prepared according to the size of the volunteers
 booth str tak swayamsevakarees pramukh ne kaha ki jis gati se sangh shaharon main fail rahaa he vah gaanvon kii apeksha zyada he
 Join more and more rural youth organizations, the Sangh is striving for this
 aadhunikeekaran ke baavjood, aaj bhi bharat kii aatma gaanvon main hi basati he
 The Modi government's focus is also on agriculture and the RSS is also focusing on rural areas, so that the Sangh volunteers reach every polling booth in the villages till the 2019 elections, thereby increasing the vote vote in favor of BJP
 siem yogi ke saath baithksangam ke pehle din mohan bhagwat ne band daravaaje ke peeche soobe ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke saath baithak bhi kii
 It is believed that in this meeting, the current scenario of the country and the state between the two and the growing unrest among the people against BJP was discussed
 upi kii satta sanbhaalane ke baad se yogi adityanath or bhagwat kii yah duusari gupt baithak he
 Social activist and President of the Muslim Development Council of India, Sami Agai said that the RSS has always said that it is not involved in politics, but it is a good thing that the Sangh is now working as a driving force for the BJP
 sami aagaai ne kaha ki ummid he, janata 2019 ke chunaav main modi sarkaar ke jhuthe vaadon main nahin funsane vaali or inhen satta se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaegi
 He also said that if this does not happen, then in the coming 5 years, PM Modi will take such steps that the country will not be able to come out of the clutches of BJP for decades
 newclear saplyrs group (enesji) kii sadsyta ko lekar bharat ke khilaaf pakistan or china kii sajeesh naakaam hoti dikh rahi he
 India's efforts in this case have also received strong support from France after America
 france ne buudhvaar ko ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki parmaanu niyantran vyavasthaaon main bharat kii sahabhaagita samvedansheel vastuon ke niryaat ko behatar tareeke se niyantrit karne main madad karegi, chaahe ve parmanvik hon, rasinic hon, jaivik hon, belistic hon yaa paramparaagat saamagree or praudyogiki hon
 The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement, 'france believes that India's entry into the four multilateral export control regimes (NSG, MTCR, The Australia Group and The Wassenaar Arrangement) will strengthen international efforts in fighting nuclear proliferation
 'mantralay ne kaha, 'enesagimen purna roopen sadsy ke taur par bharat ke pravesh ke sakriy or dirghakaalik samarthan kii disha main france sol main 23 june ko baithak kar rahe iske sadasyon se sakaaratmak nirnay lene kaa aahvaan karata he
 Earlier, the US had said in a statement on Tuesday that India was ready for membership of the NSG
 america ne sahabhaagi sarkaron se guuruuvaar ko sol main shuru ho rahe enesji ke do divasiy purna satr main bharat ke aavedan kaa samarthan karne ko kaha tha
 China's stance Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar has reached Seoul to garner support in the group of 48 countries divided on the issue of membership of India
 bharat kaa virodh china yah kahkar kar rahaa he ki bharat ne parmaanu aprasar sandhi (enpiti) par dastakhat nahin kiye hai
 However, he is saying that Pakistan should be given membership of the group if India is exempted from the NSG
 bharat or pakistanki sadsyta ke mudde par china ne kaha ki yah vishay purna satr ke agenda main nahin he
 Here too, Beijing looked at the affairs of the two neighboring countries together, even though there is a difference in their nuclear non-proliferation track record
 nai dilli main adhikariyon ne is baat par jor diya ki enesji kii prakriya najuk or jatil he or bharat kii sambhaavnaaon par atakalein nahin lagaai jaani chahie
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Jinpingguru may meet in Tashkent where they will attend the SCO conference
 modi enesji ke vishay par jinping se baat kar sakate hai lekin gauratlab hoga ki kya china apane rakh main badlaav laaegaa
 About 20 countries are supporting India's favor for the NSG, but India has a tough task in view of the consensus decision in the NSG
 harfanmaulaa khilaadi hardik pandya ne bhartiya team management dwaara lords test ke liye do spin gendbaaj khilaane ke faisle kaa bachaav kiya he
 The Indian team went into the match with Kuldeep Yadav as the extra spin bowler while the situation was according to the fast bowlers and it seemed that the third fast bowler would have helped the team
 pandya ne kuldeep ko khilaane ke faisle kaa bachaav kiya
 He said, 'obviously the management of the team must be thinking about this
 agar yah paanch dinon kaa match hota to spinneron kii bhoomika ahm hoti
 Everything changed due to rain
 ’landan main team india ke lunch main 'bif pasta', twitor par hui jamkar khinchihardik pandya ko lagata he ki duusare test match ke tisare din lunch ke baad gendbaajon ko madad kii kami ke kaaran england puri tarah se bharat par haaavee rahaa
 In reply to India's 107 runs, England have scored 357 for six in the first innings and their total lead has been 250 runs
 tisare din lunch ke samay england kii sthiti bhi bahut acchhee nahin thi
 The team had lost four wickets at 89
 lunch ke baad 131 ran par unka paanchvaan wicket gira tha
 After that, a 189-run partnership for the sixth wicket between Chris Woakes (120 not out) and Johnny Bairstow (93) gave England a big lead and the Indian team would have to hope for a miracle to return to the match
 mohammad caff bole- sachin, ganguli or dravid jaise diggajon ke saath khelnaa shandaar palapandya ne kaha, ‘lunch ke baad hamen koi madad nahin mili
 This was the problem
 ek gendbaaji ikai ke rup main, hamane koshish kii lekin gend ne achaanak swing karnaa band kar diya or ve (vokes or beresto) match ko hamaari pakad se dur le gaye
 He said, 'it happens - i have seen it in the test before
 aapako chaar yaa paanch wicket jaldi mil jate hai or phir ek saajhedaari ho jaati he
 This has happened many times with our batting line-up as well
 yah khel kaa ek hissaa he
 'under the bowlers' conditions, the Indian team could score only 107 runs in the first innings, to which Pandya said that in such circumstances, the England team also had to struggle
 unhone kaha, ‘un paristhitiyon main khelnaa mushkil tha kyonki halki barish ho rahi thi or wicket main nami thi
 Any team would have scored almost the same

 Where there is an atmosphere of chaos outside banks after demonetisation in cities
 is gaanv main jindagi apni puraani raftaar se chal rahi he
 Cash is not needed in the village shop if someone goes to buy breakfast for the children of the house or to get milk
 aakhir ye puraa digital gaanv he
 About a year and a half ago, a private bank (ICICI) adopted this village under the Prime Minister's Digital India scheme and opened accounts of around 1200 (adult) out of the village's 1500 people
 inhen online transfar kii suvidha mil gai, smartphone kii bhi jarurat nahin
 Only send money in the account of the person to whom the money is to be sent, and the funds will be transferred
 sabhi ko bahut phayda mil rahaa he
 Any behavior above 10 rupees can be treated like this
 yahaan khudare kii koi samasya nahin he
 So while people are coming to the shops less in cities, on the other hand everything is going on here as before
 tippaniyan The elderly pensioners of the village also do not have to go out
 gaanv ke ek ritred shikshak mohanbhai patel ke saath kuch samay pehle ek haadasa ho gaya tha
 When he went to a nearby city to get his pension, someone snatched the money
 lekin ab kisi buzurg ko koi chintaa nahin he
 Regardless of the bank in which the pension is deposited, they transfer it to their village account by check and spend money from the ATM of the village whenever they want
 natijatan gaanv ke is bank kaa salanaa kaarobaar dedh karod jitna he
 The ATM here is the only one in the vicinity of eight km
 lekin phir bhi jahaan shaharon main kataren kam nahin ho rahi hai vahiin yahaan koi bheed nahin he kyonki yahaan ke zyaadaatar tranjection cashles hote hai
 In such a situation, there is a need to replicate the successful experiment here in other parts of the country so that people's difficulties are reduced and their savings can increase
 kareeb dedh saal pehle ek privet bank (isiaisiai) ne pradhanmantri ke digital india yojana ke antargat is gaanv ko god liya or gaanv kii 1500 logon kii basti main se 1200 ke kareeb (vayask) ke khate khol die
 They got the facility of online transfer, not even a smartphone
 sirf jiske acount main paise daalane hai, uskaa number daalkar rakam esemes karnaa he or fund transfar ho jayega
 Everybody is getting a lot of benefit
 10 rupee se zyada kaa koi bhi vyavhaar is tarah kar sakate hai
 There is no problem of khudre here
 isliye jahaan shaharon main dukaanon main log kam aa rahe hai, vahiin duusari taraf yahaan aaraam se pehle kii tarah sab chal rahaa he
 The comments gaanv ke bujurg pensionron ko bhi baahar nahin janaa padataa he
 An incident took place some time ago with Mohanbhai Patel, a retired teacher of the village
 wo apana pension lene paas ke shahar gaye the to kisi ne paise chin liye the
 But now an elderly person has no worries
 pension chaahe jis bank main jamaa ho, wo check se ise apane gaanv ke acount main transfar kar lete hai or jab chahie tab gaanv ke atm se paise nikaalkar kharch karte hai
 As a result, the annual business of this village bank is as high as 1
5 crore
 aasapaas ke aath kimi ke ilaake main yahaan kaa atm iklauta he
 But still where the queues are not decreasing in the cities, there is no rush because most of the transactions here are cashless
 aise main jarurat he yahaan ke safal prayog ko desh ke anya hisson main dohraane kii taaki logon kii mushkilen kam hon or unki bachat bad sake
 The elderly pensioners of the village also do not have to go out

 According to the daily, although this officer did not give the exact number of arrests, according to sources it could be 40
 sari badi baton or badi khabaron ke bich kabhi khud ko rakh kar dekhiegaa ki system ke jab chakkar lagate hai tab aapkaa kya anubhav rahata he
 Hundreds of people keep sending such stories to us
 pard kar yaa sunakar bahut dukh bhi hota he
 i wish if the entire media had taken these things to the government, i would not have regretted the refusal of everyone
 iskaa simpal kaaran yah he ki system ne logon ko is kadar pis diya he, ki un kahaniyon kaa peechha karne, sari ghatnaon ke taar ko jodne main bhi kaaphi vakt lag jaae
 Yet sometimes it seems that this story stops
 jahaan tak sambhav hota he ek baar kehete hai aapke saamne
 So the story is that on August 7, Harikrishna Premchand Mandiramalani ji and his wife left from Burhanpur in Madhya Pradesh
 system ne inhen deen hin dikhte rahane kaa aisa abhyaas kara diya he ki mere saamne baithne se bhi sankoch karne lage
 i was old enough to stand in front of them, so i remained standing and requested them to sit
 magar system ne inke bheetar kii manushyata ko apni krurta se itnaa kuchal diya he ki bolne se pehle kaaphi der tak galaa bharaa rahaa
 It was seen from the top that they have been broken to the last extent, but when it started, it was discovered that it was broken but the passion to stand again is still left
 kitne din pehle kii baat he, bas yahi sawaal kiya tha ki saath aae bete ne kaha ki aparaadh ke 521 din ho chuke hai
 On 19 March 2018, Harikrishna Premchand Mandiramalani and his wife had come to Delhi but i could not meet them
 yah isliye bataa rahaa hum kyonki ab main aapako yahi bataane ja rahaa hum ki in donon ne apni beti ke insaaf ke liye kisase kitni baar mulaakaat kii, kahaan 85 din bitaye, footpath par kya bechaa magar phir bhi inkaa iraadaa nahin tutaa
 Where does such a pungent hope remain, especially among those whom the system is bent on assuring that nothing will happen to you, do what you have to do
 yah maamla dahej pratadna kaa he
 This is Boski
 pukaar kaa naam he
 By the way the name is Pragati
 32 saal kii thi jab 22 may 2016 ko maharashtra ke jaalnaa nivasee vikaas sadhvani se shaadi hui
 a year later, i get a call from my mother that the daughter's health has worsened
 maa baap jab tak uske paas pahunchate vah coma main ja chuki thi
 Nobody knows anything
 sasuraal vaale kehete hai ki sugar ke kaaran behosh ho gai he
 During treatment, it is revealed that Boski has a baby in his stomach
 10 din baad bhi jab bosaki hosh main nahin ai to parivaar use lekar pune ke rani haul aspataal main gaya
 It is found that the daughter is not unconscious but has gone into a coma
 85 din ummid main kaat die ki kya pataa hosh aa jaae
 He regains consciousness and then learns that he was beaten to death for dowry
 ab bosaki ko hosh aa chukaa he
 He also has a daughter
 ab iskaa vazan kaaphi kam ho chukaa he
 After leaving the hospital, she reaches the police directly in a wheel chair
 cese darj karti he
 Three months after the incident
 premchand kehete hai, 'ek baar achaanak phone aayaa ki aapaki bacchee kaa sugar down ho gaya he aap jaldi akola aaiye
 It is a matter of 5 / 3 / 2017
 ham log jaise hi pahunche dekha ki hamaari bacchee ventilator main aakhri saans gin rahi thi
 There we were told that his sugar went down
 do teen din main kuch nahin hua to kuch din ke baad duusare aspataal le gaye lekin vahaan bhi kuch nahin hua
 We said that other major hospitals which are in Mumbai and in Pune take them there
 lekin sasuraal waalon ne manaa kar diya
 We told a doctor in Pune about her baby girl's report
 doctor ne kaha ki yah bahut gambhir maamla he or turant admit karnaa padegaa
 We moved to Pune and remained in a coma for 85 days
 or jab hosh main aayaa to bataaya kii sasuraal main maarthe the, hasband bhi martha tha, saas sasur bhi maarthe the
 ' ek aadmi kii zindagi main kya kya hota he, agar aap is kahani ko puraa sun lenge to kaaphi der tak sochane ke liye majaboor ho jaaenge ki ham sarkaron ko lekar itani maaraa maari karte hai lekin ek akele aadmi ko insaaf kyon nahin miltaa he
 Not only this, when the daughter was in the hospital, a relative started pressurizing the management to discharge her from the hospital
 inkaa koi lenaa dena nahin tha magar jabaran aspataal se nikalwane lage
 But the parents were adamant that after the delivery of their senses, only when the delivery of the child will come out of here
 is kahani main bahut kuch seekhney ke liye he
 The family arrived in Pune city on 20 March 2017 and remained in the hospital until 28 July 2017
 147 dinon tak ilaaj karaayaa
 Used to sleep on the terrace of the hospital or while looking around
 kul 37 din aise guzare honge jab ek shaam kaa khaanaa bhi mushkil se pati patni or bete ko mila hoga
 When Roshan Lal, the canteen of the hospital came to know about this, he talked to the management and started feeding the three evenings
 is dauraan bacchee coma se baahar ai, ek bacchee kii maa bani
 The newborn girl was named Harmandir
 yah parivaar apane dukhon ko sankhya main badal chukaa he
 The number of days, months and people who have come for help is ready
 bete keshav ne bataaya ki pune ke 15-16 logon ne khub madad kii
 Some gave 1000 and some 10,000
 pune main ek gurudwara he
 Balirod Gurudwara
 yahaan ke kisi shankhapal singh ko pataa chalaa to inase milane aae
 Offered to stay in Gurudwara
 ravivaar ko sangat ke liye aae logon se jo bhi jamaa hua 8-10 hazaar rupaya wo sab inhen de diya
 If the system was breaking them, then the anonymous people of the society were saved from breaking
 harikrishna premchand ji kii burhanpur ke gujarati market main khilone kii dukaan thi
 Prem Store
 beti ke ilaaj ke dauraan yah dukaan band ho gai
 In Pune, he had to do something himself to stay alive for 147 days
 premchand ji ne is tufaan main bhi apane hunar ko nahin choda
 They took the Deccan Express from Pune to Mumbai at 7 am and used to come to Pune by 8 pm in the same train
 khub khilone bhar kar laate the or shanivaar or ravivaar ke din vahaan ke jijamata udyaan main aane vaali bheed ko bechaa karte the
 Everyone came to know that there is a family that is doing so much for their daughter
 is mushkil halaat main ginacologist doctor sangeeta tendulkar kaa yah parivaar ahasaanamand ho gaya he
 Premchand ji talks less about his suffering, more about Sangeeta Tendulkar who saved his daughter's life and left two and a half lakh rupees of her fees
 sangeeta ko sarkaar inaam de, iske liye ve kabhi pradhanmantri to kabhi raashtrapati ko patr likhte rahete hai
 The man who is broken with his daughter over injustice, is also struggling for the award of humanity of a doctor
 bhayankar tufaan main ghira ek insaan is kadar rachanaatmak ho saktaa he, yah samajhane ke liye agar aapako inke ek-ek shabd sunne chahie
 Hear how this man was running from here to there for justice
 beti ke bachane kii duaen kar rahaa tha or apane jeene ke liye jivan ko bachaa rahaa tha
 Premchand told, 'the shop Maken was all closed
 hosh aane ke baad 45 din ke baad delivery huyi phir kuch din ke baad ham madhya pradesh gayi or police complen karavaaya
 But the police said that you should lodge a complaint in the crime cell of Maharashtra
 phir ham vahaan pahunche or vahaan ke saansad sanjay dotre ji se mili
 The MP was a very good gentleman
 saansad ne sabhi baaten sunin
 Some of his mlas said that compromise
 ham samjhauta nahin karnaa chaahate the or nahin kiya
 We went to give statements, then our statements were not taken
 vahaan khadaan police stesan padataa he
 Again we went with our girl and came and gave a statement and we were told that action would be taken but the arrest was not done
 chah maheene ke baad police ne ek kamjor FIR banaaya
 The police should not put the clauses and put the case in court
 hamane yah bhi kaha tha ki cese hamaare home state main hona chahie lekin hamaari baat ko nahin suna gaya
 There is no hope of getting justice yet
 vahaan ke kisi bhi vibhaag kaa koi sahyog nahin he
 The in-laws took bail before the case was filed
 abhi 30 agast ko apradhi paksh kii peshi he
 The main thing is that we did not have our mlc in Akola
 jab use gambhir sthiti main aspataal main admit karavaaya gaya tab rule ke hisaab se MLC hona chahie thi lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya
 Everything was suppressed
 bacchee ke daant toote hue hai
 She was on the ventilator and generally you know that the ventilator is put on one that reaches the last moment
 do din tak bacchee aise hi padi rahi lekin MLC nahin hui
 ' may 2016 kaa cese he
 August 2018 has arrived
 kisi kii giraftaar nahin hui he
 His daughter Pratima, whose household name is Boski, is taking care of each day so that she can live to see justice
 uskaa vazan 40 kilogram tak pahunch gaya he
 The father is running Delhi so that the Supreme Court can transfer the case from Akola to Burhanpur
 ab beti kaa vazan itnaa nahin he ki burhanpur se akola sunwaayee ke liye ja sake
 We are close to 15 August
 us mulk ko khud se bhi hisaab dena chahie ki ek naagarik kii aaj kya haisiyat he
 Thank you for this, that despite all this, there has not been any shame in him
 logon ke liye vahi pyaar he or system se vahi nadaan ummid
 Look at this strip
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri se milane ke liye gale main baandhne ke liye di jaati he
 It is given everywhere
 premchand or unki patni sonu 17-18 baar milane gaye usee kaa yah pramaan he
 He has kept every meeting strip
 ek dastauez kii tarah jise dekhakar hamaara system shame se sar jhukaa sake
 By the way, he is not ashamed
 ek aadmi jab insaaf kii daud shuru karata he to sabase pehle mukhyamantri, pradhanmantri, raashtrapati or chif justise ko patr likhata he
 The letter of receipt and acknowledgment of the registry of those letters begins to be handled
 har baar chitthee kholta he ki is baar insaaf aayaa hoga magar nikalataa aashwaasan he, aapkaa patr mila, sambandhit mantralay ko bhej diya gaya he
 Gratitude

 But see the expectation from your Chief Minister
 sochie ki likhte vakt kitne aansu girte honge ki vahaan pahunchate hi karrwai ho jaae
 Premchand ji also wrote letters to the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh

 People keep track of every day
 mukhyamantri or koi adhikari is kaarykram ko dekhegaa to hansi aegi ki ye kya kar rahaa he
 This is how millions of letters come every day
 vahi to ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki un patron kaa kya hota he
 Does anyone out there matter how hopeful people will write
 phir mukhyamantri hi bataaen ki ve log janata darbar kyon karte hai
 Why take people's applications by hand? iskaa matlab he ki in patron kii kuch to ahmiyat hoti hogi
 If someone has to suffer in this way for a simple case, then with this system you should also think that what will happen to you if you come out for justice someday
 (harikrushan premchand ji kehete hai, 'pradhanmantri ko hamane 17-18 baar likhaa he, madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko aath-das baar likhaa, maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ko aath das likhaa
 The letters are only being received and forward but no action is taken
 hamane modi jo ko likhaa he, dhyaan dene ke liye likhaa he, unase milanaa chaahate hai
 This was the first time in India that such a critical case was properly treated by the doctor and our baby girl and her baby survived
 kai logon ne phone kiya, america se phone aayaa, landan se phone aayaa
 ' ab premchand pradhanmantri se apni beti ke insaaf ke liye nahin milanaa chaahate balki us doctor ke liye milanaa chaahate hai jisane sahi ilaaj kiya or fees maaf kar di
 Similarly, Bihar banker Alok Chanda was killed
 eemaandaar banker kii eemaandaaree kii pahchaan mili iske liye unka parivaar dar dar bhatak rahaa he
 He has given up hope for justice, wants the system of government to honor his martyrdom
 kabhi ve cycle yatra kii baat karte hai kabhi netaaon se milakar patr likhaate rahete hai
 You heard the story of Harikrishna, now i tell the story of another Haribilas who came from Mathura, the city of Hari
 hamaare ye do hari wo hari nahin he jo rajyasabha ke upasabhapati banane ke liye maidan main utre the
 Out of those two Hari, one Hari lost and one Hari won
 magar meri kahani ke ye donon hari kisi se haare nahin hai
 It is sure that everyone wants to defeat them
 tippaniyan This person is Haribilas Parashar sitting in a wheelchair outside the office
 subah se hi aakar intazaar kar rahaa tha
 Has come to meet Mathura
 sunakar hi thithak gaya ki main inke kya kaam aa saktaa hum
 The conversation started that between the tales of a person's fierce struggle between the system and society, we all began to wonder how to see India's polity like a trick of a fraud
 haribilas mathura zile ke gaanv thok sunai ke rahane vaale haribali paraashaar hai
 While climbing the train in 2008, the shoe slipped and both of Hari's feet were cut
 iske pehle wo shooter bananaa chahta tha
 Wanted to take medals in Olympics for the country
 ensisi main shaamil hokar vah apane sapanom ko paravaan de rahaa tha ki isi root se wo ek din sena main or phir olympic main pahunch jayega
 Legs cut off but did not lose heart
 vah sabko patr likhata he
 When he writes a letter, he keeps the receipt of his registry
 apane saath bag main puraa ricard lekar chalata he
 a couple of mps also called it
 madad kii baat bhi kahi magar kuch nahin hua
 Hari says that the government has a policy for the differently abled
 magar wo niti wheel chair or pension baantne kii he
 Do not give job
 hari ko kisi ne bataaya ki twitor par sabko likhaa karo
 She started following everyone with the Twitter handle @ haribilas89
 isane ummid nahin haari he
 It is said that i still hold a penal meeting
 ek baar naukari mil jaae to bas olympic tak bhi pahunch jayega
 It will be interesting to know what happens to the letters sent from the Prime Minister to the Chief Minister's offices
 un logon ko to pataa he ki chitthee bhejne par kya hota he, aapako pataa rahe to behatar hoga
 The meeting of these citizens, who had to bear the brunt of the system, understood one thing
 inke paas shikayaton kaa pulinda to bahut zyaada he magar baatcheet main ummiido kaa sailaab nazar aata he
 These are the people who remind the careless system every day that you will have to be responsible and accountable one day
 harikrishna or haribali ke saahas ko salaam
 On 19 March 2018, Harikrishna Premchand Mandiramalani and his wife had come to Delhi but i could not meet them
 yah isliye bataa rahaa hum kyonki ab main aapako yahi bataane ja rahaa hum ki in donon ne apni beti ke insaaf ke liye kisase kitni baar mulaakaat kii, kahaan 85 din bitaye, footpath par kya bechaa magar phir bhi inkaa iraadaa nahin tutaa

 You heard the story of Harikrishna, now i tell the story of another Haribilas who came from Mathura, the city of Hari
 hamaare ye do hari wo hari nahin he jo rajyasabha ke upasabhapati banane ke liye maidan main utre the
 Out of those two Hari, one Hari lost and one Hari won
 magar meri kahani ke ye donon hari kisi se haare nahin hai
 It is sure that everyone wants to defeat them
 tippaniyan This person is Haribilas Parashar sitting in a wheelchair outside the office
 subah se hi aakar intazaar kar rahaa tha
 Has come to meet Mathura
 sunakar hi thithak gaya ki main inke kya kaam aa saktaa hum
 The conversation started that between the tales of a person's fierce struggle between the system and society, we all began to wonder how to see India's polity like a trick of a fraud
 haribilas mathura zile ke gaanv thok sunai ke rahane vaale haribali paraashaar hai
 While climbing the train in 2008, the shoe slipped and both of Hari's feet were cut
 iske pehle wo shooter bananaa chahta tha
 Wanted to take medals in Olympics for the country
 ensisi main shaamil hokar vah apane sapanom ko paravaan de rahaa tha ki isi root se wo ek din sena main or phir olympic main pahunch jayega
 Legs cut off but did not lose heart
 vah sabko patr likhata he
 When he writes a letter, he keeps the receipt of his registry
 apane saath bag main puraa ricard lekar chalata he
 a couple of mps also called it
 madad kii baat bhi kahi magar kuch nahin hua
 Hari says that the government has a policy for the differently abled
 magar wo niti wheel chair or pension baantne kii he
 Do not give job
 hari ko kisi ne bataaya ki twitor par sabko likhaa karo
 She started following everyone with the Twitter handle @ haribilas89
 isane ummid nahin haari he
 It is said that i still hold a penal meeting
 ek baar naukari mil jaae to bas olympic tak bhi pahunch jayega
 It will be interesting to know what happens to the letters sent from the Prime Minister to the Chief Minister's offices
 un logon ko to pataa he ki chitthee bhejne par kya hota he, aapako pataa rahe to behatar hoga
 The meeting of these citizens, who had to bear the brunt of the system, understood one thing
 inke paas shikayaton kaa pulinda to bahut zyaada he magar baatcheet main ummiido kaa sailaab nazar aata he
 These are the people who remind the careless system every day that you will have to be responsible and accountable one day
 harikrishna or haribali ke saahas ko salaam
 This is Boski
 pukaar kaa naam he
 By the way the name is Pragati
 32 saal kii thi jab 22 may 2016 ko maharashtra ke jaalnaa nivasee vikaas sadhvani se shaadi hui
 a year later, i get a call from my mother that the daughter's health has worsened
 maa baap jab tak uske paas pahunchate vah coma main ja chuki thi
 Nobody knows anything
 sasuraal vaale kehete hai ki sugar ke kaaran behosh ho gai he
 During treatment, it is revealed that Boski has a baby in his stomach
 10 din baad bhi jab bosaki hosh main nahin ai to parivaar use lekar pune ke rani haul aspataal main gaya
 It is found that the daughter is not unconscious but has gone into a coma
 85 din ummid main kaat die ki kya pataa hosh aa jaae
 He regains consciousness and then learns that he was beaten to death for dowry
 ab bosaki ko hosh aa chukaa he
 He also has a daughter
 ab iskaa vazan kaaphi kam ho chukaa he
 After leaving the hospital, she reaches the police directly in a wheel chair
 cese darj karti he
 Three months after the incident
 ek aadmi kii zindagi main kya kya hota he, agar aap is kahani ko puraa sun lenge to kaaphi der tak sochane ke liye majaboor ho jaaenge ki ham sarkaron ko lekar itani maaraa maari karte hai lekin ek akele aadmi ko insaaf kyon nahin miltaa he
 Not only this, when the daughter was in the hospital, a relative started pressurizing the management to discharge her from the hospital
 inkaa koi lenaa dena nahin tha magar jabaran aspataal se nikalwane lage
 But the parents were adamant that after the delivery of their senses, only when the delivery of the child will come out of here
 is kahani main bahut kuch seekhney ke liye he
 The family arrived in Pune city on 20 March 2017 and remained in the hospital until 28 July 2017
 147 dinon tak ilaaj karaayaa
 Used to sleep on the terrace of the hospital or while looking around
 kul 37 din aise guzare honge jab ek shaam kaa khaanaa bhi mushkil se pati patni or bete ko mila hoga
 When Roshan Lal, the canteen of the hospital came to know about this, he talked to the management and started feeding the three evenings
 is dauraan bacchee coma se baahar ai, ek bacchee kii maa bani
 The newborn girl was named Harmandir
 yah parivaar apane dukhon ko sankhya main badal chukaa he
 The number of days, months and people who have come for help is ready
 bete keshav ne bataaya ki pune ke 15-16 logon ne khub madad kii
 Some gave 1000 and some 10,000
 pune main ek gurudwara he
 Balirod Gurudwara
 yahaan ke kisi shankhapal singh ko pataa chalaa to inase milane aae
 Offered to stay in Gurudwara
 ravivaar ko sangat ke liye aae logon se jo bhi jamaa hua 8-10 hazaar rupaya wo sab inhen de diya
 If the system was breaking them, then the anonymous people of the society were saved from breaking
 harikrishna premchand ji kii burhanpur ke gujarati market main khilone kii dukaan thi
 Prem Store
 beti ke ilaaj ke dauraan yah dukaan band ho gai
 In Pune, he had to do something himself to stay alive for 147 days
 premchand ji ne is tufaan main bhi apane hunar ko nahin choda
 They took the Deccan Express from Pune to Mumbai at 7 am and used to come to Pune by 8 pm in the same train
 khub khilone bhar kar laate the or shanivaar or ravivaar ke din vahaan ke jijamata udyaan main aane vaali bheed ko bechaa karte the
 Everyone came to know that there is a family that is doing so much for their daughter
 is mushkil halaat main ginacologist doctor sangeeta tendulkar kaa yah parivaar ahasaanamand ho gaya he
 Premchand ji talks less about his suffering, more about Sangeeta Tendulkar who saved his daughter's life and left two and a half lakh rupees of her fees
 sangeeta ko sarkaar inaam de, iske liye ve kabhi pradhanmantri to kabhi raashtrapati ko patr likhte rahete hai
 The man who is broken with his daughter over injustice, is also struggling for the award of humanity of a doctor
 bhayankar tufaan main ghira ek insaan is kadar rachanaatmak ho saktaa he, yah samajhane ke liye agar aapako inke ek-ek shabd sunne chahie
 Hear how this man was running from here to there for justice
 beti ke bachane kii duaen kar rahaa tha or apane jeene ke liye jivan ko bachaa rahaa tha
 Premchand told, 'the shop Maken was all closed
 hosh aane ke baad 45 din ke baad delivery huyi phir kuch din ke baad ham madhya pradesh gayi or police complen karavaaya
 But the police said that you should lodge a complaint in the crime cell of Maharashtra
 phir ham vahaan pahunche or vahaan ke saansad sanjay dotre ji se mili
 The MP was a very good gentleman
 saansad ne sabhi baaten sunin
 Some of his mlas said that compromise
 ham samjhauta nahin karnaa chaahate the or nahin kiya
 We went to give statements, then our statements were not taken
 vahaan khadaan police stesan padataa he
 Again we went with our girl and came and gave a statement and we were told that action would be taken but the arrest was not done
 chah maheene ke baad police ne ek kamjor FIR banaaya
 The police should not put the clauses and put the case in court
 hamane yah bhi kaha tha ki cese hamaare home state main hona chahie lekin hamaari baat ko nahin suna gaya
 There is no hope of getting justice yet
 vahaan ke kisi bhi vibhaag kaa koi sahyog nahin he
 The in-laws took bail before the case was filed
 abhi 30 agast ko apradhi paksh kii peshi he
 The main thing is that we did not have our mlc in Akola
 jab use gambhir sthiti main aspataal main admit karavaaya gaya tab rule ke hisaab se MLC hona chahie thi lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya
 Everything was suppressed
 bacchee ke daant toote hue hai
 She was on the ventilator and generally you know that the ventilator is put on one that reaches the last moment
 do din tak bacchee aise hi padi rahi lekin MLC nahin hui
 ' may 2016 kaa cese he
 August 2018 has arrived
 kisi kii giraftaar nahin hui he
 His daughter Pratima, whose household name is Boski, is taking care of each day so that she can live to see justice
 uskaa vazan 40 kilogram tak pahunch gaya he
 The father is running Delhi so that the Supreme Court can transfer the case from Akola to Burhanpur
 ab beti kaa vazan itnaa nahin he ki burhanpur se akola sunwaayee ke liye ja sake
 We are close to 15 August
 us mulk ko khud se bhi hisaab dena chahie ki ek naagarik kii aaj kya haisiyat he
 Thank you for this, that despite all this, there has not been any shame in him
 logon ke liye vahi pyaar he or system se vahi nadaan ummid
 Look at this strip
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri se milane ke liye gale main baandhne ke liye di jaati he
 It is given everywhere
 premchand or unki patni sonu 17-18 baar milane gaye usee kaa yah pramaan he
 He has kept every meeting strip
 ek dastauez kii tarah jise dekhakar hamaara system shame se sar jhukaa sake
 By the way, he is not ashamed
 ek aadmi jab insaaf kii daud shuru karata he to sabase pehle mukhyamantri, pradhanmantri, raashtrapati or chif justise ko patr likhata he
 The letter of receipt and acknowledgment of the registry of those letters begins to be handled
 har baar chitthee kholta he ki is baar insaaf aayaa hoga magar nikalataa aashwaasan he, aapkaa patr mila, sambandhit mantralay ko bhej diya gaya he
 Gratitude
 likhaa hota he

 But see the expectation from your Chief Minister
 sochie ki likhte vakt kitne aansu girte honge ki vahaan pahunchate hi karrwai ho jaae

 People keep track of every day
 mukhyamantri or koi adhikari is kaarykram ko dekhegaa to hansi aegi ki ye kya kar rahaa he
 This is how millions of letters come every day
 vahi to ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki un patron kaa kya hota he
 Does anyone out there matter how hopeful people will write
 phir mukhyamantri hi bataaen ki ve log janata darbar kyon karte hai
 Why take people's applications by hand? iskaa matlab he ki in patron kii kuch to ahmiyat hoti hogi
 If someone has to suffer in this way for a simple case, then with this system you should also think that what will happen to you if you come out for justice someday
 (harikrushan premchand ji kehete hai, 'pradhanmantri ko hamane 17-18 baar likhaa he, madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko aath-das baar likhaa, maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ko aath das likhaa
 The letters are only being received and forward but no action is taken
 hamane modi jo ko likhaa he, dhyaan dene ke liye likhaa he, unase milanaa chaahate hai
 This was the first time in India that such a critical case was properly treated by the doctor and our baby girl and her baby survived
 kai logon ne phone kiya, america se phone aayaa, landan se phone aayaa
 ' ab premchand pradhanmantri se apni beti ke insaaf ke liye nahin milanaa chaahate balki us doctor ke liye milanaa chaahate hai jisane sahi ilaaj kiya or fees maaf kar di
 Similarly, Bihar banker Alok Chanda was killed
 eemaandaar banker kii eemaandaaree kii pahchaan mili iske liye unka parivaar dar dar bhatak rahaa he

 harikrishna or haribali ke saahas ko salaam
 Harikrishna Premchand ji had a toy shop in Gujarati Market in Burhanpur
 prem store
 This shop closed during the treatment of the daughter
 pune main 147 dinon tak zindaa rahane ke liye khud bhi kuch karnaa tha
 Premchand ji did not leave his skills even in this storm
 ve subah 7 baje pune se dakkan express pakad kar mumbai jane lage or shaam ko 8 baje tak usee train se pune aa jate the
 Used to bring a lot of toys and sold them to the crowds coming to Jijamata Gardens on Saturday and Sunday
 sabko pataa chal gaya tha ki ek aisa parivaar he jo apni beti ke liye itnaa sab kuch kar rahaa he
 In this difficult situation, the family of gynecologist Dr
 Sangeeta Tendulkar has become grateful
 premchand ji apni takalif kii baat kam, sangeeta tendulkar kii baat zyaada karte hai jinhone inaki beti kii jaan bachaai or apni fees ke dhai lakh rupee chhod die
 For this, the government rewards Sangeeta, sometimes he writes letters to the Prime Minister or sometimes to the President
 jo vyakti khud apni beti ke saath ninsaphi ko lekar tutaa hua he wo ek doctor kii insaaniyat ke puraskaar ke liye bhi sangharsh kar rahaa he
 To understand that a person engulfed in a severe storm can be so creative, if you must listen to their words
 suniye ki kaise yah shaks insaaf ke liye yahaan se vahaan daud rahaa tha
 Praying for the daughter's escape and saving her life to live
 premchand ne bataaya, 'duukaan maakan sab band tha
 After regaining consciousness, delivery was done after 45 days, then after a few days we went to Madhya Pradesh and got a police complex
 lekin police ne kaha ki aap maharashtra ke krime cell main shikaayat darj karavaaen
 Then we reached there and met Sanjay Dotare ji, the MP there
 saansad bahut achche sajjan the
 The MP listened to everything
 unke kisi vidhayak ne kaha ki samjhauta kar lo
 We did not want to compromise and did not
 ham log bayaan dene gaye phir hamaare bayaan nahin liye gaye
 The quarry police station falls there
 dobaaraa ham apni bacchee ke saath gaye or bayaan dekar aaye or hamen bataaya gaya ki karrwai hogi lekin arest nahin hui
 After six months, the police created a weak FIR
 jo dharaaen lagani chahie vah police ne nahin lagaai or cese ko court main daal diya
 We had also said that the case should be in our home state but our point was not heard
 abhi tak nyaay milane kii koi ummid nahin lag rahi he
 There is no cooperation of any department there
 cese file hone se pehle sasuraal waalon ne jamaanat le lee thi
 At present, on 30 August, the criminal side is produced
 mukhya baat yah he ki akola main hamaari mlc nahin huyi
 When he was admitted to the hospital in critical condition, then according to the rule MLC should have been done but it was not done
 sab kuch dabaa diya gaya
 The baby's teeth are broken
 vah ventilator par thi or saadhaaran taur par aap jaanate hai ki ventilator usko lagaaya jaataa he jo aakhri samay main pahunch jaataa he
 For two days, the child lay like this but MLC did not
 ' May 2016 case
 agast 2018 aa gaya he
 No one has been arrested
 unki beti pratimaa jiske ghar kaa naam bosaki he, ek-ek din sambhaal rahi he taaki insaaf ko dekhne ke liye zindaa rah sake
 His weight has reached 40 kg
 baap dilli daud rahaa he taaki supreme court is cese ko akola se burhanpur transfar kar de
 Now the daughter's weight is not enough that Akola from Burhanpur can go for hearing
 ham 15 agast ke bilkul kareeb hai
 That country should also account for itself what the status of a citizen is today
 is baat ke liye shukriya adaa karnaa chahie ki itnaa sab hone ke baad bhi uske andar talkhi nahin ai he
 The same love for people and the same foolish expectation from the system
 ye pattee dekhie
 It is given to the neck to meet the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 har jagah vaise di jaati he
 This is the proof that Premchand and his wife Sonu went to meet 17-18 times
 har mulaakaat kii pattee inhone sambhaal kar rakhi he
 Like a document, our system can bend our head in shame
 vaise use shame aati nahin he
 When a man starts the race for justice, he first writes letters to the Chief Minister, Prime Minister, President and Chief Justice
 un patron kii registry kii raseed or pavati kaa patr sanbhaalane lagata he
 Every time the letter opens, this time there will be justice but there is assurance, your letter has been received, it has been sent to the concerned ministry

 On Monday, 2018, the Ministry gave a complaint letter of vicissitudes in the statements
 ab yahi shaks madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko bhi patr likhata he
 What happens to the letters of troubled people, only the government can tell
 lekin apane mukhyamantri se ummid dekhie
 Think how many tears must have fallen while writing that action should be taken as soon as you reach there
 premchand ji ne madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko bhi patr likhe

 Also sent letter from 2018 CM helpline, no hearing
 log har din kaa hisaab rakhte hai
 If the Chief Minister and any officer watches this program, then you will laugh what it is doing
 aise to har din lakhon patr aate hai
 We want to know what happens to those letters
 kya vahaan kisi ko is baat se fark padataa he ki log kitni ummid se likhte honge
 Then the Chief Minister should explain why they do Janata Darbar
 kyon logon ke aavedan ko khud haath se lete hai
 This means that these letters must have some importance
 ek saadhaaran se cese ke liye kisi ko is tarah se bhugatna pade to phir is system ke saath aapako bhi sochna chahie ki kisi din insaaf ke liye niklenge to aapke saath kya hone vaala
 (harikrishan Premchand ji says, 'we have written to the Prime Minister 17-18 times, written eight-ten times to the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, eight-ten times to the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 letters sirf risive or forward ho rahe hai lekin koi karwaai nahin hui he
 We have written to Modi, who has written to pay attention, wants to meet him
 bharat varsh main aisa pehali baar hua jab aise ek critical cese kaa doctor ne sahi dhang se ilaaj kiya or hamaari bacchee or uski bacchee batch gayi
 Many people called, got a call from America, got a call from London
 ' Now Premchand does not want to meet the Prime Minister for justice for his daughter, but for the doctor who has given the right treatment and waived the fees
 isi tarah bihar ke banker alok chanda kii hatya ho gai
 The honest banker is wandering from family to family in order to be recognized as honest
 unhone insaaf kii aas chhod di he, chaahate hai ki sarkaar kaa system unki is shahadat ko sammanit kare
 Sometimes they talk about cycling, sometimes they meet leaders and write letters
 aapane harikrishna kii kahani suni, ab ek or haribilas kii kahani sunaata hum jo hari kii nagari mathura se aayaa tha
 Our two Hari are not the Hari who entered the field to become the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 un do hari main se ek hari haar gaye or ek hari jeet gaye
 But these two Hari of my story have not lost to anyone
 ye zarur he ki sab unhen haraa dena chaahate hai
 The comments daftar ke baahar wheelchair par baitha yahi shaks haribilas parashar he
 Been waiting since morning
 mathura se milane aae hai
 Hearing this, i was stunned as to what i could do with them
 baatcheet shuru hui ki system or samaaj ke bich ek vyakti ke zindadil sangharsh kii dastaan ke bich ham sab hairaani se bharat kii rajyavyavastha ko kisi chal kapat kii maaya kii tarah dekhne samajhane lage
 Haribilas is Haribali Parashar, resident of Thok Suna, a village in Mathura district
 2008 main railgadee par chadhate samay juuta phisal gaya or hari ke donon paavan cat gaye
 Before that he wanted to be a shooter
 desh ke liye olympic main padak lenaa chahta tha
 By joining NCC, he was fulfilling his dreams that he would one day reach the army and then the Olympics
 paanv cat gaye magar hausala nahin haara
 He writes letters to everyone
 patr likhata he to uski registry kii raseed natthi karke rakh letaa he
 She carries the entire record in the bag with her
 ek do saansadon ne ise phone bhi kiya
 Said to help but nothing happened
 hari kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke paas divyangon ke liye ek niti he
 But that policy is to distribute wheel chair and pension
 naukari dene kii nahin he
 Someone told Hari to write to everyone on Twitter
 usne twitor handle @haribilas89 se sabko follow karnaa shuru kar diya
 It has not lost hope
 kahata he ki ab bhi dand baithak karata hum
 Once you get a job, the bus will also reach the Olympics
 pradhanmantri se lekar mukhyamantri ke daftaron ko bheji jane vaali chitthiyon kaa kya hota he, yah jaananaa dilachasp rahegaa
 Those people know what happens when they send a letter, it would be better if you know
 system kaa sitam jhelte jhelte in nagarikon se milakar ek baat samaj ai
 They have a lot of complaints, but the conversation is full of expectations
 ye wo log hai jo laaparvaah vyavastha ko rose yaad dilaate hai ki aapako ek din zimmedaar or javabdeh hona hi padegaa
 Salute to the courage of Harikrishna and Haribali
 is mushkil halaat main ginacologist doctor sangeeta tendulkar kaa yah parivaar ahasaanamand ho gaya he
 Premchand ji talks less about his suffering, more about Sangeeta Tendulkar who saved his daughter's life and left two and a half lakh rupees of her fees
 sangeeta ko sarkaar inaam de, iske liye ve kabhi pradhanmantri to kabhi raashtrapati ko patr likhte rahete hai
 The man who is broken with his daughter over injustice, is also struggling for the award of humanity of a doctor
 bhayankar tufaan main ghira ek insaan is kadar rachanaatmak ho saktaa he, yah samajhane ke liye agar aapako inke ek-ek shabd sunne chahie

 Premchand told, 'the shop Maken was all closed

 jab use gambhir sthiti main aspataal main admit karavaaya gaya tab rule ke hisaab se MLC hona chahie thi lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya
 Everything was suppressed
 bacchee ke daant toote hue hai

 kisi kii giraftaar nahin hui he
 His daughter Pratima, whose household name is Boski, is taking care of each day so that she can live to see justice
 uskaa vazan 40 kilogram tak pahunch gaya he
 The father is running Delhi so that the Supreme Court can transfer the case from Akola to Burhanpur
 ab beti kaa vazan itnaa nahin he ki burhanpur se akola sunwaayee ke liye ja sake
 We are close to 15 August
 us mulk ko khud se bhi hisaab dena chahie ki ek naagarik kii aaj kya haisiyat he
 Thank you for this, that despite all this, there has not been any shame in him
 logon ke liye vahi pyaar he or system se vahi nadaan ummid
 Look at this strip

 It is given everywhere
 premchand or unki patni sonu 17-18 baar milane gaye usee kaa yah pramaan he
 He has kept every meeting strip
 ek dastauez kii tarah jise dekhakar hamaara system shame se sar jhukaa sake
 By the way, he is not ashamed
 ek aadmi jab insaaf kii daud shuru karata he to sabase pehle mukhyamantri, pradhanmantri, raashtrapati or chif justise ko patr likhata he
 The letter of receipt and acknowledgment of the registry of those letters begins to be handled
 har baar chitthee kholta he ki is baar insaaf aayaa hoga magar nikalataa aashwaasan he, aapkaa patr mila, sambandhit mantralay ko bhej diya gaya he

 But see the expectation from your Chief Minister

 mukhyamantri or koi adhikari is kaarykram ko dekhegaa to hansi aegi ki ye kya kar rahaa he
 This is how millions of letters come every day
 vahi to ham jaananaa chaahate hai ki un patron kaa kya hota he
 Does anyone out there matter how hopeful people will write
 phir mukhyamantri hi bataaen ki ve log janata darbar kyon karte hai
 Why take people's applications by hand? iskaa matlab he ki in patron kii kuch to ahmiyat hoti hogi
 If someone has to suffer in this way for a simple case, then with this system you should also think that what will happen to you if you come out for justice someday
 (harikrushan premchand ji kehete hai, 'pradhanmantri ko hamane 17-18 baar likhaa he, madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri ko aath-das baar likhaa, maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ko aath das likhaa
 The letters are only being received and forward but no action is taken
 hamane modi jo ko likhaa he, dhyaan dene ke liye likhaa he, unase milanaa chaahate hai
 This was the first time in India that such a critical case was properly treated by the doctor and our baby girl and her baby survived

 ' ab premchand pradhanmantri se apni beti ke insaaf ke liye nahin milanaa chaahate balki us doctor ke liye milanaa chaahate hai jisane sahi ilaaj kiya or fees maaf kar di
 Similarly, Bihar banker Alok Chanda was killed
 eemaandaar banker kii eemaandaaree kii pahchaan mili iske liye unka parivaar dar dar bhatak rahaa he
 He has given up hope for justice, wants the system of government to honor his martyrdom

 You heard the story of Harikrishna, now i tell the story of another Haribilas who came from Mathura, the city of Hari
 hamaare ye do hari wo hari nahin he jo rajyasabha ke upasabhapati banane ke liye maidan main utre the
 Out of those two Hari, one Hari lost and one Hari won
 magar meri kahani ke ye donon hari kisi se haare nahin hai
 It is sure that everyone wants to defeat them
 tippaniyan This person is Haribilas Parashar sitting in a wheelchair outside the office
 subah se hi aakar intazaar kar rahaa tha
 Has come to meet Mathura
 sunakar hi thithak gaya ki main inke kya kaam aa saktaa hum
 The conversation started that between the tales of a person's fierce struggle between the system and society, we all began to wonder how to see India's polity like a trick of a fraud
 haribilas mathura zile ke gaanv thok sunai ke rahane vaale haribali paraashaar hai
 While climbing the train in 2008, the shoe slipped and both of Hari's feet were cut
 iske pehle wo shooter bananaa chahta tha
 Wanted to take medals in Olympics for the country
 ensisi main shaamil hokar vah apane sapanom ko paravaan de rahaa tha ki isi root se wo ek din sena main or phir olympic main pahunch jayega
 Legs cut off but did not lose heart
 vah sabko patr likhata he
 When he writes a letter, he keeps the receipt of his registry
 apane saath bag main puraa ricard lekar chalata he
 a couple of mps also called it
 madad kii baat bhi kahi magar kuch nahin hua
 Hari says that the government has a policy for the differently abled
 magar wo niti wheel chair or pension baantne kii he
 Do not give job
 hari ko kisi ne bataaya ki twitor par sabko likhaa karo
 She started following everyone with the Twitter handle @ haribilas89

 It is said that i still hold a penal meeting
 ek baar naukari mil jaae to bas olympic tak bhi pahunch jayega
 It will be interesting to know what happens to the letters sent from the Prime Minister to the Chief Minister's offices
 un logon ko to pataa he ki chitthee bhejne par kya hota he, aapako pataa rahe to behatar hoga
 The meeting of these citizens, who had to bear the brunt of the system, understood one thing
 inke paas shikayaton kaa pulinda to bahut zyaada he magar baatcheet main ummiido kaa sailaab nazar aata he
 These are the people who remind the careless system every day that you will have to be responsible and accountable one day
 harikrishna or haribali ke saahas ko salaam
 Premchand told, 'the shop Maken was all closed
 hosh aane ke baad 45 din ke baad delivery huyi phir kuch din ke baad ham madhya pradesh gayi or police complen karavaaya
 But the police said that you should lodge a complaint in the crime cell of Maharashtra
 phir ham vahaan pahunche or vahaan ke saansad sanjay dotre ji se mili
 The MP was a very good gentleman
 saansad ne sabhi baaten sunin
 Some of his mlas said that compromise
 ham samjhauta nahin karnaa chaahate the or nahin kiya
 We went to give statements, then our statements were not taken
 vahaan khadaan police stesan padataa he
 Again we went with our girl and came and gave a statement and we were told that action would be taken but the arrest was not done
 chah maheene ke baad police ne ek kamjor FIR banaaya
 The police should not put the clauses and put the case in court
 hamane yah bhi kaha tha ki cese hamaare home state main hona chahie lekin hamaari baat ko nahin suna gaya
 There is no hope of getting justice yet
 vahaan ke kisi bhi vibhaag kaa koi sahyog nahin he
 The in-laws took bail before the case was filed

 No one has been arrested
 unki beti pratimaa jiske ghar kaa naam bosaki he, ek-ek din sambhaal rahi he taaki insaaf ko dekhne ke liye zindaa rah sake
 His weight has reached 40 kg
 baap dilli daud rahaa he taaki supreme court is cese ko akola se burhanpur transfar kar de
 Now the daughter's weight is not enough that Akola from Burhanpur can go for hearing
 ham 15 agast ke bilkul kareeb hai
 That country should also account for itself what the status of a citizen is today
 is baat ke liye shukriya adaa karnaa chahie ki itnaa sab hone ke baad bhi uske andar talkhi nahin ai he
 The same love for people and the same foolish expectation from the system
 ye pattee dekhie
 It is given to the neck to meet the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 har jagah vaise di jaati he
 This is the proof that Premchand and his wife Sonu went to meet 17-18 times

 Like a document, our system can bend our head in shame
 vaise use shame aati nahin he
 When a man starts the race for justice, he first writes letters to the Chief Minister, Prime Minister, President and Chief Justice

 log har din kaa hisaab rakhte hai
 If the Chief Minister and any officer watches this program, then you will laugh what it is doing
 aise to har din lakhon patr aate hai
 We want to know what happens to those letters
 kya vahaan kisi ko is baat se fark padataa he ki log kitni ummid se likhte honge
 Then the Chief Minister should explain why they do Janata Darbar
 kyon logon ke aavedan ko khud haath se lete hai
 This means that these letters must have some importance
 ek saadhaaran se cese ke liye kisi ko is tarah se bhugatna pade to phir is system ke saath aapako bhi sochna chahie ki kisi din insaaf ke liye niklenge to aapke saath kya hone vaala
 (harikrishan Premchand ji says, 'we have written to the Prime Minister 17-18 times, written eight-ten times to the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, eight-ten times to the Chief Minister of Maharashtra
 letters sirf risive or forward ho rahe hai lekin koi karwaai nahin hui he
 We have written to Modi, who has written to pay attention, wants to meet him
 bharat varsh main aisa pehali baar hua jab aise ek critical cese kaa doctor ne sahi dhang se ilaaj kiya or hamaari bacchee or uski bacchee batch gayi
 Many people called, got a call from America, got a call from London
 ' Now Premchand does not want to meet the Prime Minister for justice for his daughter, but for the doctor who has given the right treatment and waived the fees
 isi tarah bihar ke banker alok chanda kii hatya ho gai
 The honest banker is wandering from family to family in order to be recognized as honest
 unhone insaaf kii aas chhod di he, chaahate hai ki sarkaar kaa system unki is shahadat ko sammanit kare
 Sometimes they talk about cycling, sometimes they meet leaders and write letters
 aapane harikrishna kii kahani suni, ab ek or haribilas kii kahani sunaata hum jo hari kii nagari mathura se aayaa tha
 Our two Hari are not the Hari who entered the field to become the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 un do hari main se ek hari haar gaye or ek hari jeet gaye
 But these two Hari of my story have not lost to anyone
 ye zarur he ki sab unhen haraa dena chaahate hai
 The comments daftar ke baahar wheelchair par baitha yahi shaks haribilas parashar he
 Been waiting since morning
 mathura se milane aae hai
 Hearing this, i was stunned as to what i could do with them
 baatcheet shuru hui ki system or samaaj ke bich ek vyakti ke zindadil sangharsh kii dastaan ke bich ham sab hairaani se bharat kii rajyavyavastha ko kisi chal kapat kii maaya kii tarah dekhne samajhane lage
 Haribilas is Haribali Parashar, resident of Thok Suna, a village in Mathura district
 2008 main railgadee par chadhate samay juuta phisal gaya or hari ke donon paavan cat gaye
 Before that he wanted to be a shooter
 desh ke liye olympic main padak lenaa chahta tha
 By joining NCC, he was fulfilling his dreams that he would one day reach the army and then the Olympics
 paanv cat gaye magar hausala nahin haara
 He writes letters to everyone
 patr likhata he to uski registry kii raseed natthi karke rakh letaa he
 She carries the entire record in the bag with her
 ek do saansadon ne ise phone bhi kiya
 Said to help but nothing happened
 hari kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke paas divyangon ke liye ek niti he
 But that policy is to distribute wheel chair and pension
 naukari dene kii nahin he
 Someone told Hari to write to everyone on Twitter
 usne twitor handle @haribilas89 se sabko follow karnaa shuru kar diya
 It has not lost hope
 kahata he ki ab bhi dand baithak karata hum
 Once you get a job, the bus will also reach the Olympics
 pradhanmantri se lekar mukhyamantri ke daftaron ko bheji jane vaali chitthiyon kaa kya hota he, yah jaananaa dilachasp rahegaa
 Those people know what happens when they send a letter, it would be better if you know
 system kaa sitam jhelte jhelte in nagarikon se milakar ek baat samaj ai
 They have a lot of complaints, but the conversation is full of expectations
 ye wo log hai jo laaparvaah vyavastha ko rose yaad dilaate hai ki aapako ek din zimmedaar or javabdeh hona hi padegaa
 Salute to the courage of Harikrishna and Haribali

 aapane harikrishna kii kahani suni, ab ek or haribilas kii kahani sunaata hum jo hari kii nagari mathura se aayaa tha
 Our two Hari are not the Hari who entered the field to become the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 un do hari main se ek hari haar gaye or ek hari jeet gaye
 But these two Hari of my story have not lost to anyone
 ye zarur he ki sab unhen haraa dena chaahate hai
 The comments daftar ke baahar wheelchair par baitha yahi shaks haribilas parashar he
 Been waiting since morning
 mathura se milane aae hai
 Hearing this, i was stunned as to what i could do with them
 baatcheet shuru hui ki system or samaaj ke bich ek vyakti ke zindadil sangharsh kii dastaan ke bich ham sab hairaani se bharat kii rajyavyavastha ko kisi chal kapat kii maaya kii tarah dekhne samajhane lage
 Haribilas is Haribali Parashar, resident of Thok Suna, a village in Mathura district
 2008 main railgadee par chadhate samay juuta phisal gaya or hari ke donon paavan cat gaye
 Before that he wanted to be a shooter
 desh ke liye olympic main padak lenaa chahta tha
 By joining NCC, he was fulfilling his dreams that he would one day reach the army and then the Olympics
 paanv cat gaye magar hausala nahin haara
 He writes letters to everyone
 patr likhata he to uski registry kii raseed natthi karke rakh letaa he
 She carries the entire record in the bag with her
 ek do saansadon ne ise phone bhi kiya
 Said to help but nothing happened
 hari kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke paas divyangon ke liye ek niti he
 But that policy is to distribute wheel chair and pension
 naukari dene kii nahin he
 Someone told Hari to write to everyone on Twitter
 usne twitor handle @haribilas89 se sabko follow karnaa shuru kar diya
 It has not lost hope
 kahata he ki ab bhi dand baithak karata hum
 Once you get a job, the bus will also reach the Olympics
 pradhanmantri se lekar mukhyamantri ke daftaron ko bheji jane vaali chitthiyon kaa kya hota he, yah jaananaa dilachasp rahegaa
 Those people know what happens when they send a letter, it would be better if you know
 system kaa sitam jhelte jhelte in nagarikon se milakar ek baat samaj ai
 They have a lot of complaints, but the conversation is full of expectations
 ye wo log hai jo laaparvaah vyavastha ko rose yaad dilaate hai ki aapako ek din zimmedaar or javabdeh hona hi padegaa
 Salute to the courage of Harikrishna and Haribali
 ek aadmi jab insaaf kii daud shuru karata he to sabase pehle mukhyamantri, pradhanmantri, raashtrapati or chif justise ko patr likhata he
 The letter of receipt and acknowledgment of the registry of those letters begins to be handled
 har baar chitthee kholta he ki is baar insaaf aayaa hoga magar nikalataa aashwaasan he, aapkaa patr mila, sambandhit mantralay ko bhej diya gaya he
 Gratitude
 likhaa hota he

 At the same time, the DU administration says that it only issues guidelines for admission at the graduation level
 baaki puri prakriya jismencertificatki jaanch bhi shaamil he, college ke str par puri hoti he
 However, the college professor is demanding a CBI inquiry into the entire matter
 ratanlal, history professor hindu college ne is maamle main sibiai se jaanch kii maang karte hue kaha he kii wo is maamle ko essi, asti ayog le jaayenge
 According to Ratanlal, in such a case, there is also negligence and connivance of big people

 According to ABVP, the strictest action should be taken against all those involved in this fraud

 In such a situation, not only the name of DU is being spoiled by this new fraud but also the credibility of DU is being questioned

 plastic body vaale is tivi kaa vajan aapako vaaki kaaphi halkaa mahasoos hoga
 The display panel in this TV is given by Samsung
 is tivi main bejals die gaye gaye hai unhen kuch or patala kiya ja saktaa tha
 However, the bezels still given do not affect its look
 is tivi main jitne bhi ports hai wo back kii taraf die gaye hai
 At the same time, some important buttons have been provided in the lower right of the TV, including the change button, volume button and power button
 wal mount iske saath hi diya gaya he aise main teble main rakhane ke alaava yugers ise wal par lataka sakate hai
 It is quite easy to handle because of not having much weight
 haalanki overol luk is tivi kaa kaaphi prabhavi nahin lagata, lekin aapako keemat kaa dhyaan is dauraan rakhana hoga
 Talking about the remote provided with this TV, the remote is also made entirely of plastic and its buttons are plastic
 batan ke sies kaaphi had tak bade hi hai jisase ise upyog karnaa aasaan he or kaaphi saare function ke liye batan maujuud hai
 In the given photo you can see the button of the remote
 haalanki sabase badi kami is tivi yaa remote kii kah sakate hai ki isamen naa hi wais cmand ke liye saport diya gaya he naa hi QWERTY kii-board kaa saport diya gaya he
 In such a situation, while using the TV, you have to use the keyboard in the TV interface
 or ise remote se nevigate karnaa kaaphi mushkil he
 Ports and Connectivity: Like this smart TV of Thomson, the ports are given in two parts
 kuch ports neeche kii taraf maujuud to kuch ports bagal main die gaye hai
 It has an RF input, an AV in, three HDMI ports, a component (ypbpr), two UDB ports for the pen drive, an s card port for using memory cards, a headphone jack, and support for Ethernet - RJ45
 saath hi isamen pikchar fries opshan ke saath-saath screen shot lene kaa feechar bhi shaamil he
 USB copy feature is also available here, that is, any file can also be copied to the TV
 connactivity kii baat karen to ethernet maujuud hone kii vajah se LAN connactivity kaa saport is tivi main diya gaya he
 Apart from this, customers will get one touch button directly inside the remote for web browsing
 iske alaava yahaan Wifi 802
 Support of 11 b / g / n exists
 in sab standard feechar ke alaava yahaan miracast kaa saport bhi maujuud he, yani mobile kii mirarring sidhe tivi main kii ja sakati he
 Also, this TV is compatible with wireless mouse and keyboard
 audio:is tivi main maujuud sound mod kii baat karen to yahaan standard, yujar, mujeec, movie or sport mod diya gaya he
 The surround is also present in this TV
 yahaan audio output ke liye 20 wat box spikars die gaye hai or audio kii quality ko aap bahut zyada behatar nahin sakate
 Its quality is mid ranger
 aise main aap headphone jaik kaa upyog kar kisi duusare spikar kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Picture quality: This TV of Thomson has a Samsung grade LED panel with 3840 x 2160 resolution with 60hz refresh rate, 16: 9 ratio and 178 degree wide viewing angle
 iskaa contrast reshyo 4 xxrep 6 0 : 1 (dynemic) he
 During the review of this TV, we did not face any problem in 4K playback
 miracast saport bhi behatar hi laga
 Talking about brightness, it was also better, that is, in terms of giving 4K resolution at this price, the company is much better than other companies present in the market
 haalanki jo samasya ai wo dark colors ko lekar he
 That is, TV performance is very good in terms of brightness and contrast, but many times when you watch deep or dark colors, you may have some complaints from the panel
 kyonki colors vaastavik nahin lagate
 You can get help by going in the settings but still you will not see much difference in quality
 jahaan tak vuing angel kii baat he to ye kaaphi had behatar he
 You may find some colors changed by a particular angle, but you can leave them in daily use
 parformens:sabase pehle is tivi ke spacifications kii baat karen to yahaan CA53 dual-kor 1
 mali-t720mp2 GPU has been given with 4ghz processor, 8GB internal memory and 1GB RAM
 ye tivi android varjan 5
 1
 1 par chalata he
 First of all the new 5 in it
 0 maay wal kii baat karen to ye company kaa nayaa interphes he
 There is a lot here from the Weather Report to the Quick Search feature
 is interphes ko puraane tivi model kii tulana main kaaphi behatar kah sakate hai
 Because different types of content have direct access here
 yani indian movie, sports or trending mujeec ke liye van tach acces yahaan maujuud hai
 Also, all the settings will be found on the screen itself
 is tivi main saare jaruri eps bhi prilolade hai or baaki eps ko downlod karne ke liye ap store bhi diya gaya he
 In addition to Hindi and English, content of Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati and other Indian languages will also be found here
 haalanki android varjan 5
 1
 1 ke saport hone kii vajah se kuch heavi or letest ap kaa saport shaayad naa mili
 It was expected that at least Android Nougat could be supported to make this TV better
 iske alaava aap is tivi main maujuud 8GB kii internal memory main kuch file downlod kar yaa copy kar seve bhi kar sakate hai
 Talking about speed while running the TV, there was a problem of some hang in the beginning and although it cannot be called bad according to the price
 keval 1GB ram diya gaya he
 In such a situation, you can get upset with this TV while processing too fast or switching apps
 baaki kisi ap ko chalaane main yaa surfing ke dauraan koi khaas samasya aapako nahin aegi
 The biggest problem is the remote key with this TV where due to lack of QWERTY keyboard or voice search, it becomes somewhat difficult to search content in an app or say youtube
 aise main is pareshaani ko dur karne ke liye company ko aage aane vaale modelon main kaam karnaa hoga
 However, you can use wireless keyboards instead
 faisla:ye tivi un logon ke liye behatar ho saktaa he jo bajet main badi screen ke saath 4K tivi chaahate hai
 Along with this, Android based smart interface is also provided here, which makes this TV even more special
 iske alaava aap thomson naam ke bharose ke saath bhi chal sakate hai
 However, this TV with budget also has some shortcomings which can be ignored keeping the price in mind
 remote main wais search kaa opshan dekar company ise or bhi behatar bana sakati he

 In the PMO, Minister of State Jitendra Singh stirred up on Tuesday by announcing that the new government has started the process of removing Article 370
 haalanki, baad main unhone kaha ki media ne unke bayaan ko tod-marodakar pesh kiya
 But as soon as he said this, the war became faster
 jahaan jammu kashmir ke siem umr abdulla ne kaha ki agar 370 hataai gai to jammu evam kashmir bharat kaa hissaa nahin hoga to vahiin aresas ne palatwaar kiya ki rajya se samvidhan kii dhara 370 hate yaa na hate, lekin yah rajya bharat kaa abhinn ang rahegaa
 Let us know what is Article 370 in ten points
 1
 Article 370 of the Constitution gives Jammu and Kashmir the status of a special autonomous state through temporary arrangements
 2
 The blueprint of 370 was prepared in 1947 by Sheikh Abdullah, who was appointed Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Maharaja Hari Singh
 3
 Sheikh Abdullah argued about 370 that it should not be provisionally managed in the Constitution
 unhone rajya ke liye majboot swytta kii maang kii thi, jise centre ne thukraa diya tha
 4
 370 ke praavdhaanon ke anusaar sansad ko jammu-kashmir ke bare main raksha, videsh maamle or sanchaar ke vishay main kanoon banane kaa adhikaar he
 But to implement the law related to other subject, the Center needs the approval of the state
 5
 Due to this special status, Article 356 of the Constitution does not apply to Jammu and Kashmir
 raashtrapati ke paas rajya ke samvidhan ko barkhaast karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 6
 bharat ke duusare rajyon ke log jammu-kashmir main jameen nahin kharid sakate hai
 Citizens here have dual citizenship
 ek naagarikta jammu-kashmir kii or duusari bharat kii hoti he
 7
 yahaan duusare rajya ke naagarik sarkari naukari nahin kar sakate
 8
 bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 360 jisamen desh main vittiya apatkaal lagane kaa praavdhaan he, vah bhi jammu-kashmir par lagu nahin hota
 9
 anuchhed 370 kii vajah se hi jammu-kashmir kaa apana alag jhanda or pratik chinh bhi he
 10
 1965 tak jammu or kashmir main rajyapal kii jagah sadar-e-riyasat or mukhyamantri kii jagah pradhanmantri hua karata tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who describes himself as the son of Ganga Maa, is an MP from Banaras
 awaas dilli ke 7 lok kalyaan maarg par he, jabaki paitruk nivas gujarat main he
 The question arises that where are the Modi voters? Where will Modi vote? On December 14, Thursday, votes will be cast in 93 seats of the second round of Gujarat assembly elections
 is charan main madhya gujarat or uttar gujarat ke 14 jilon kii siten shaamil he
 Narendra Modi's mother Heerabenagandhi will use her franchise in the city
 jaankaree ke mutabik, guuruuvaar ko modi apane matadhikaar kaa prayog karne ke liye gujarat jaaenge
 Modi will vote at Ranip booth center in Ahmedabad, Gujarat
 subah ek kaarykram karne ke baad modi ahmedabad jaaenge
 That is, Modi is still a voter of Ahmedabad
 jab modi or manmohan kaa hua saamana, kuch aisa tha najarakai viviipi daalenge votedusre charan main piem modi sahit kai viviipi matdaan karenge
 Among these, BJP President Amit Shah will cast his vote at Naranpura booth
 rajya keepurv mukhyamantri anandiben patechhmadabad ke thaltej booth par matdaan karengi
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, LK Advani and Gujarat Deputy CM Nitin Patel will cast their votes in Ahmedabad
 bijepi hi nahin balki congress ke kai diggaj netaa bhi apane kshetra main matdaan karenge
 In this, Congress leader Shakti Singh Gohil will vote in Gandhinagar, India at Borsad booth in Solanki Anand district, Alpesh Thakor in Ranip area of ahmedabad, Jignesh Mevani in Ahmedabad
 iske alaava congress ke baagi netaa or purv mukhyamantri shankar singh waghela gandhinagar ke vaasania gaanv main, patidaar netaa hardik patel ahmedabad jile kii viramgaam main matdaan karenge
 BJP ruined my image by investing a lot of money - Rahul, read 10 things from the interview " "salmaan khan kii pahchaan ab bollywood ke bindaas superstar se aage nikal chuki he
 Salman has now become the show man of the small screen
 ek aise sho main, jiskaa naam hi darshakon ko tivi on karne par majaboor kar detaa he
 The identity changed with the passage of time, so Salman Khan's identity also changed
 salmaan kii nai big bajet film 'wanted' release hui, lekin is film se zyada charchaa '10 kaa dam' kii he
 Salman comes on the screen once a week and overpowers the hearts of his millions of fans
 jalawaa jamaane kaa andaaj to koi salmaan se siikhe
 Whatever the guests may be, whatever the mood may be, if anyone's color in '10 Ka Dum 'is Salman Khan
 jab salmaan khan sawaal poochhate hai, to bade se bade celebrities laajawab ho jate hai
 Boney Kapoor, who became a guest of Rahmasalman, does not question the guests, when he was asked about obesity, Boney was forced to look at his armpits
 boni ne baat sanbhaalane kii bharpoor koshish kii, lekin salmaan ke aage unki ek na chali
 Whether it is the way of asking questions or the style of joking around with guests, this host falls heavily on every guest
 apni puraani dost shridevi ko bhi unhone nahin bakhsha
 Salman's style of taking a pinch makes fans crazy
 salmaan kii ek shararti muskaan achche-acchon kii pole khol detii he
 Salman is the expert in the presence, who does not miss a chance to get pulled nor does anyone give a chance
 salmaan ke sho main aaye ek se badhakar ek kai sitaron ne apni hazirajvaabi dikhaane kii koshish kii, lekin salmaan khan ke saamne sabake sab laajawab ho gayi
 Sense of Humor also has very few Bollywood stars like Sense of Humor
 apane chutile andaaz se salmaan 10 kaa dam main na sirf mehmaanon ko gudgudate hai, balki darshakon kaa bhi bharpoor manoranjan karte hai
 Nobody speaks when Salman speaks, but friends are different
 salmaan apane dam par puri mehfil lut lete hai
 They rarely speak about themselves
 jab bhi bolte hai dil se bolte hai
 The story of Salman is interesting, but when Salman himself opens it layer by layer, people look at him without blinking
 chote parde par laharaaya parachmasalmaan kii inhen adaaon ne unhen bade parde ke saath-saath chote parde kaa bhi superstar bana diya he
 So far, on TV shows from Shah Rukh to Shekhar Suman have been adept at bringing guests to the show, but Salman told the same show why they are wanted for TV viewers
 romantic or ection hero ke rup main salmaan khan bade parde par hit rahe, lekin chote parde par unki kamyaabi nai bulandiyon ko chhu rahi he
 In 10 ka salman, Salman runs such an arrow of words that the people who come on the show become lazy
 muskuraat va hansi, donon laajawabsalamaan tahaakaa lagaate hai, to log taaliyaan bajaate hai
 When Salman laughs, people become crazy
 yahi he salmaan kii hansi kaa dam
 Salman's romantic smile on the big screen has turned into a cool laugh on the small screen
 salmaan kaa ek tahaakaa ek hajaar darshakon ko das kaa dam kaa mureed bana saktaa he, yah baat khud sallu miyaan ko bhi acchhee tarah maaloom he
 This is the reason why Salman's laughter is becoming episode by episode
 talash lete hai hansi kaa maukamehamaan chaahe jo ho or mehfil chaahe jaisi ho, salmaan hansi kaa mauka jarur talash lete hai
 Whether it is Katrina Kaif or Sunil Shetty Salman definitely adds a laugh to his show
 vaise salmaan ne tahaakon kaa hit formula pehali baar sanjay or jaiki shraap ke sho main khulkar istemaal kiya
 Salman's fun makes the audience woo, while his cool laugh makes people laugh as well as increasing the TRP of the show
 20 saal se box offis par raaj karne vaale salmaan ab chote parde par bhi jabardast kamaal dikhaa rahe hai

 priyanka gandhi ke varanasi se chunaav ladane ke jawaab main grahamantri ne kaha ki koi kahin se bhi chunaav lade modi ko chunauti nahin de paaegaa
 After 2014, Modi's popularity has increased
 modi sarkaar 2019 main phir aa rahi he
 Yudh Veeras do not count dead corpses
 In the past, the statement given in Mathura was 'veer soldiers came to kill', then they said that Yudh Veerar corpses are not counted
 rashtrawad vaali raajnneeti par grahamantri ne kaha ki rashtrahit ke liye sabhi pratidwadh hai
 Do we do politics not to build homes but to build nations
 ham jati, dharm, majahab kii raajnneeti nahin karte hai
 The politics of polarization is not what the BJP does

 We are talking about Akash Dudlani, close to Shilpa

 Shilpa was seen crying while celebrating the development

 The two fought in front of Salman Khan in the show's premiere episode
 ghar ke andar shilpa or vikaas kaa jhagada hameshaa hi limlite main rahaa he
 Both have had strong battles
 kai baar vikaas ko isse pareshaan hokar ghar se bhaagane kii koshish karte hue bhi dekha gaya he

 vaise akaash dadlani ke sawaal main dam to he
 Was the battle for Shilpa and Vikas really the fix? Well, the friendship of these two is so true and how false
 yah to vakt hi batayega
 In the past too, Vikas has been seen many times trying to sort out a bad relationship with Shilpa
 lekin duusare hi pal ve phir se jhagadne lagate the
 Their patchups made a lot of headlines, it will be interesting to see what color their friendship brings
 aamtaur par agar kisi vibhaag main piemo ke khat aate he to vahaan khalabali much jaati he, lekin jharkhand is maamle main thodaa alag he
 Here, on the letter of PMO, the officers sleep soundly
 darasal, puraa maamla airport athurity dwaara adhigrahit kii gai jameen par muaavje se sambandhit he
 It is alleged that the victim Dinesh Prasad did not get compensation just because he did not pay a bribe of 15 lakhs to the land acquisition officers and employees
 is vajah se ve beete paanch varshon se vibhinn daftaron main alag-alag tablon par apni shikaayat kii filein lekar daud rahe hai
 In spite of seeking clarification from PMO, no action is taken
 In fact, for Ranchi Airport, land was taken from 13 people, all of them have a pro-fat case on their land
 lekin inamen se 12 logon ko jameen ke badale muaavja de diya gaya, sivaay ek dinesh prasad ke, kyonki unhone adhikariyon or karmchaariyon ko rishwat nahin di
 Hurt by this, his daughter Riya Varman wrote a letter to the Prime Minister
 usne patr main bataaya ki bahut mushkil se ghar chal rahaa he
 Papa is tired of circling different departments and is troubled by financial and mental torture
 ham logon ke samneatmadah karne ke sivaor koi rasta nahin he
 You have a government in Jharkhand, but no one is listening to my appeal here
 riya ke patr ko piemo ne gambhirtha se lete hue 22 april 2017 ko sarkaar ke nodel afasar dipti secretary chandrabhushan prasad ko (piemo-di-2017-0177100) online jaankaree di chandrabhushan prasad ne 25 april ko dipti secretary avadh narayan prasad ko maamla forward kar diya
 When Riya met Awadh Narayan Prasad after a few days in this regard, she was told that no letter related to the action had yet come from the PMO
 hairat kii baat yah he ki peedit parivaar is mudde ko mukhyamantri raghuvar das ke janata darbar main bhi uthaa chukaa he, lekin abtak koi karrwai nahin hui he
 Compensation to 12 people, for one, the rule-bound family alleges that the compensation was given to the remaining 12 people on the basis of which the land collector is not being compensated by the Additional Collector
 thana number 298, khaataa number 30 main kul 13 logon kii jameen he
 The filing of any land purchased from it has not been rejected
 lekin 12 logon kaa bagaiyr daakhil khaarij ke hi muaavja de diya gaya, jabaki,rishwat nahin dene ke kaaranunhen kaha gaya ki bagaiyr daakhil-khaarij kaa muaavja bhugtan sambhav nahin he

 Someone touches us anywhere, hands, but now we will not be silent

 On the bus stand, on the train
 koi hamen kahin bhi chhu detaa he, haath laga detaa he, lekin ab ham chup nahin rahenge
 ' taapasi kahati hai, 'kya ham itane laachaar hai ki ham apni hi suraksha khud nahin kar sakate
 Actually, when someone touches us, at that time our brain stops working and we are unable to give our reaction and this person takes advantage of this situation
 ' tippaniyan Tapasi says that in such a situation you can use your weapons for God, like you can shout

 yah baat vishaal ne abhi aadhikarik rup se bhale hi naa kahi ho lekin apane ek intervyuu main vah ishaara kar chuke hai
 Vishal said, "now the time has come for me to sit down with the writer and start writing the script of the Kaminey sequel and soon i will start working on it
" ’bataaya jaataa he ki ‘kamine’ ke sikval ke liye khud shahid kapur kaaphi utsahit hai or iske liye vishaal se khud shahid ne sifarish kii he
 Vishal, happy with Shahid's performance in 'haider' after 'kaminey', believes that Shahid Kapoor is the only one among the young actors who has the potential of the best actors like Pankaj Kapoor and Naseeruddin Shah
 sirf yahi nahin ‘haidar’ ke antim hisse kii shooting ke dauraan shahid ne yah baat sabit bhi kar di
 Says Vishal, "in the climax scene of the film, when Hyder goes mad and starts talking to himself, seeing Prakash Kapoor and Naseeruddin Shah in the mind is refreshing when Shahid is presented a six-page monologue
 sach, us seen main shahid kii acting pankaj kapur jaisi or aawaaj nasiruddin shah jaisi thi

 This was stated by Phoenix on the controversies related to the film - though no such incident has happened this time due to the activation of the Army and the US police, and Joker's lead actor Walkin Phoenix has also finally spoken on the issue
 unhone los angels times ke saath baatcheet main kaha ki unhonejocarfilm ko lekar vivaadon par chuppi saadhe rakhi kyonki isse kai gaiyr jaruri chizon ko hawa mil sakati thi
 It is worth noting that the film has made tremendous worldwide revenue and has left behind Ryan Reynolds film Deadpool 2

 Digvijay Singh also said that bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi should tell the country clearly whether he is married or not
 iske alaava digvijay ne corporate lobbying kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki is paise ke dam par narendra modi bijepi or sangh ko apni marji se haank rahe hai
 This can be read as a counter-attack of Digvijay because today Modi had ridiculed him at the public meetings of Madhya Pradesh by describing him as the chairman of a company that manufactured lies
 aaj tak ke editor at large rahul kanwal se chunaav prachaar ke bich apane vishesh vimaan main baatcheet karte hue digvijay singh ne ye aarope lagaae
 He was asked why it was happening that there was no crowd in Rahul Gandhi's rally
 ve vankhede jate hai, to screen par unki shakal dekhte hi modi-modi ke naare lagane lagate hai
 Diggi said on this question that i have been in politics for 35 years
 ye bijepi kaa standard oparating prosej he, ve congress raily main apane varkar bhejte hai or bhaashan shuru hote hi jane lagate hai
 They today also leave pigs and cows in the crowd for a stampede
 diggi ne kaha ki maine vankhede vaali clip nahin dekhi, lekin agar ek hissaa modi modi chilla bhi rahaa tha, to isamen kya mahaan baat thi
 Tell the country, Modi, married or not, while taunting Saheb surrounded by the question of girl spying, Digvijay Singh said that the great pair of Modi and Shah keep the law on cheating and sometimes fake encounters, sometimes wrongly spying
 unhone phir sawaal kaa rukh modi kii nijee jindagi kii taraf modate hue kaha ki is baat par narendra modi chup kyon hai ki ek mahila yashoda ben unki patni hone kaa daawa karti hai
 Diggy, Modi in his nomination paper always writes not applicable on the column of Marital Status
 ve desh ko bataaen ki unhone shaadi kii he yaa nahin
 The crowd will not decide who is popular
 At first, Digvijay Singh kept arguing that there is a lot of crowd in Sonia ji and Rahul ji's rallies
 phir bole ki maine bahut bheed dekhi he or uske ulat chunavi nateeja bhi
 He said that the BJP spent millions for its Hunkaar rally in Patna and called party workers, not the common man
 jab unase poocha gaya ki congress aisa kyon nahin kar paa rahi, to vah bole ki bijepi ko corporate kaa paisa mil rahaa he
 He said that money is being given to Modi in a big way
 isiilie bijepi or aresas modi par nirbhar ho gaye hai
 There are many other forces, which are conducting all this
 main is vakt khulaasa nahin kar rahaa
 Big corporates are engaged in this game
 main ab khush hum modi cesecularism or samaveshi vikaas ke agenda par apni peeth thapthapate hue digvijay singh ne kaha ki rahul gandhi ke mujffarnagar danga peediton par die bayaan ko galat sandarbh main rakhaa gaya
 He also said that i am very happy that now Modi is talking about secularism, poverty removal and inclusive development
 unhone sikh liya ye sabak ki yahaan communal nahin secular chalegaa

 It is an honor to tweet on the birth anniversary of these great men, declare the installation of the idol
 isi kii ladaai he
 After tweeting the rest, after wearing the garland, how many Gandhi are there, how many are Lohia and how many are Patel or how many are Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, how many are Deendalaya Upadhyay, you know
 main bas is bahes main apana jugad khoj rahaa hum ki isi bahaane koun mahapurush he ise ghoshit karne ke liye ek rashtriya mahapurush ayog bane or chairman mujhe hi banaaya jaae
 No country should forget history and its heroes
 lekin ek aam aadmi kaa sammaan bhi kya murti yaa naamon se hota hoga yaa phir naukari, behatar skool, aspataal, jeene kii suvidha se hota he
 It seems that the politics of India is changing in the fancy dress party
 kahin se koi gandhi bana chalaa aa rahaa he to koi lohia to koi nehru or bose
 Hopefully for the fancy dress, you will also make your children Ambedkar and Jyotibaafule, make Laxmibai and Savitribai
 gandhi ji kii tarah ek jantar detaa hum aapako
 Look around and see who is doing the glory of history apart from you
 kahin wo aapke jaisaa to nahin he
 Eating drinks and singing and wandering middle class
 kya aapane rail line kii patariyon ke kinare machharon se badan ko katwa rahe logon ko bhi nayakon kaa gunagaan karte dekha he
 Will the people who live along the buzzing drains change their way in the memory of heroes in the same way as our middle class politics
 ajeeb dhong he
 He who hates history so much as a middle class subject, mutters history with leaders
 khayr aapke priy mulk main aaj kahin kisi kisaan ne aatmahatya to kii hi hogi, usne kis itihaas or nayak ko yaad kiya hoga
 This cooperation of your people in making politics redundant will also be remembered by history
 yah mujhe kahana tha kabhi na kabhi so aaj kah diya lekin agar koi baat rahasy kii tarah ho jaae to vartmaan kaa daayitv to banataa hi he ki usase pardaa hataae
 Netaji never worked in the way Sardar Patel has been used in electoral politics
 lekin ab lagata he ki mul samasyaon se dhyaan hataakar janamat banane main unki ahm bhoomika tay ho chuki he
 Netaji has been the hero of all of us
 netaa ji subhash chandra bose bharat kii azaadi kii ladaai kii us vividhta ke misaal hai jahaan sab gandhi nahin the, sab nehru nahin the, sab sardaar patel nahin the
 It was a specialty of that period that koi bhagat singh tha, koi chandrashekhar azaad to koi khudi ram bose to koi lokmaanya to koi doctor ambedkar
 You will find such diversity of heroes only in this part of the world
 sab ek duusare ke saath the or sab ek duusare se swatantra
 Today's politics is confronting everyone
 aaj pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne ek saahasik kadam uthaaya he
 Mamata Banerjee has made public 64 files related to Netaji's last days
 unke antim dinon main kya hua ise lekar rahasy bana hua he
 There may be politics behind this announcement by Mamta, but this question has been emphasizing since what happened to Netaji
 kolkata ke police musium main mamata ne in filon kii dividi banaakar jari kar di he
 The general public will also be able to read these files from Monday
 kaha ja rahaa he ki in filon se pataa chalata he ki netaji 1964 ke saal tak zindaa the
 In the early 1960s, the American Intelligence Report indicated that Netaji must have visited India in February 1964
 unki maut ke 19 saal ke baad
 This raised the question of how he came in 1964 when he died in a plane crash in Taiwan in 1945
 12,744 pannon kii is file ko padhanaa dilachasp hoga
 Nehru and Congress have been suspected of deliberately making it a mystery
 mamata ke is kadam ke baad ab centre sarkaar par bhi dabaav he ki uske paas jo netaji se sambandhit clacyphid filein hai use saarvajanik kare
 BJP has been demanding this while in opposition 24 janvari 2014 ke times of india kii report he ki katak main bijepi adhyaksh ke naate rajnath singh ne kaha tha ki agar bijepi satta main ai to netaji kii maut se rahasy ke parde ko hataayegi
 Rajnath Singh went to participate in Netaji's 117th birth anniversary
 unhone tab kaha tha ki satya kya he centre sarkaar ko logon ko bataanaa chahie
 The BJP came to power and Rajnath Singh became the Home Minister, whose ministry would have this file
 rajnath singh ke junior mantri kiran rijiju ne kaha he ki ham dabaa kar rakhane ke haq main nahin he lekin hamen videsh mantralay se baat kerani hogi ki kya aisa karne se hamaare sambandhon par koi asar pad saktaa he yaa nahin
 Chandra Bose, a member of Netaji's family, has said that the Prime Minister should write letters to China and Russia
 vahaan se dastauez mangane chahie
 In the plane crash that took place on August 18, 1945, whether or not Netaji was killed, if there was any reason why there is a mention in different letters or documents up to 1968 that the leader was alive
 ek sawaal or he
 These documents show that Netaji's family was spied for twenty years
 mamata ne naam to nahin liya lekin ishaara nehru kii taraf tha
 The Congress party in its time did not make the documents public but welcoming Mamata's move, Congress leader PC Chacko said that azaadi ke baad us samay ke pradhanmantri nehru ke liye netaa ji kii suraksha behad mahatvapurn maamla tha
 It may have been spied on because of this
 tathy aane dijie
 The Congress views it differently
 nehru or bose ke bich ranneetiyon ko lekar matbhed zarur tha magar donon ke sambandh bahut behatar the
 The leader accepted the role of Nehru
 agar bees saal jasusi hui to nehru to 17 saal tak hi pradhanmantri the
 He was followed by Shastri from 1964 to 1966
 kya shastri ji ke samay bhi jasusi hui
 Did spying continue even after 1966? 12,744 pannon ke dastauez abhi kisi ne nahin padhe hai
 Therefore, the debate is not about what is in those files, whether the Center should release its files now

 After some time, these members pretended to form a new government under the leadership of Lalu Prasad by 'sacking' the UPA government in the House itself
 iske baad sadan kii ‘baithak’ shuru karke emsiai sanshodhan vidheyak par ‘charchaa’ karai
 However, Lalu and Mulayam later told reporters that the need to form a new government by sacking this government was because it is anti-people and acting in an undemocratic manner
 ’lalu ne kaha ‘shanivaar ko paune das baje puraa vipaksh sansad parisar main gandhi ji kii pratimaa ke samaksh dharna degaa or 10 baje sadan main ‘nayi sarkaar’ aage kii kaarywahi shuru karegi
 In this new development, he said, a meeting of the 'business Advisory Committee' has also been held, in which it has been decided to discuss 'bill' and some other 'bills' related to the salary of mps before the 'new government' on Saturday
 
 lalu prasad ne kaha, ‘samprag sarkaar aloktantric tareeke se kaam kar rahi he
 For many days, we have been raising the subject of the salary of mps and demanding implementation of the report of the Parliamentary Committee on this
 lekin sarkaar ne ise nahin maanakar hamen aapamanit kiya he
 He said that amidst the chaos, the government passed the MCI Amendment Bill and another bill when they were raising the subject in the House on Friday
 unhone kaha ‘yah baat sadan ko asanvaidhanik lagi
 Hence the new national 'janata Sarkar' was formed by sacking this government
 ’ lalu ne kaha ki sadan main hi ‘nayi sarkaar’ kii baithak bhi hui or emsiai sanshodhan vidheyak par charchaa bhi kii gai
 During the discussion, Maneka Gandhi and some other members gave their views
 unhone kaha, ‘pradhanmantri ke rup main maine is vidheyak par sadan kii bhaavana ko samajha or ise galat qaraar diya
 The RJD president said that 'my government' is a disciplined government and the opposition has no place in this 'new Lok Sabha' nor will there be any time for question hour
 yah puche jane par ki soharabuddin farji muthbhed main unki sarkaar narendra modi ko kab tak giraftaar karegi, lalu ne kaha ‘kanoon apana kaam karegaa
 Amidst the laughter of journalists, he announced that his government would set up a new pay board for journalists
