 mob linching kii tamaam ghatnaon ke bich musalamaanon ko hathiyaar kharidne or unako training dene par muslim dharmaguru kalbe javwaad ne safai di he
 In the clarification issued by Kalbe Jawwad, it was said that the reports of keeping the real or training to get license were wrong
 is tarah kaa koi kaarykram lakhanu ke imambada parisar main nahin hoga
 Muslim cleric Kalbe Jawwad said, 'this program is of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board member and Supreme Court lawyer Mahmud Paracha
 maine paraachaa se bayaan ko waapas lene ke liye kaha he or sarkaar ko samay dene ke liye kaha he
 If the government is asking to take action on mob lynching and make it harder then we should believe it
 'kalbe javwaad ne kaha, 'bharat main musalmaan sabase adhik surakshit hai or ab musalamaanon ko shiksha, rojgaar or aadhunikaran par kaam karnaa chahie
 Incidents of mob lynching have occurred in every government
 chaahe sapa ho yaa congress , lekin kisi ne kanoon banane kii baat nahin kii
 In such a situation, when the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister are talking about making strict laws, then we should have faith
 'isse pehle khabar ai thi ki supreme court ke vakil mahmud paraachaa ne lakhanu main kalbe javwaad se mulaakaat ke baad kaha tha ki aagaamee 26 taarikh ko mob linching se bachane ke liye camp lagaaya jayega, hathiyaar ke liye kaise applai kiya jaae camp main isaki training bhi di jaaegi
 Disagreeing with Mahmud Paracha, Maulana Kalbe Jawad had said that we first demand the government to enact laws on mob lynching, if the government fails to make laws, then this kind of camp should be organized and all the religious leaders To be brought together on one platform
 kalbe javwaad ne yah bhi kaha tha ki 26 taarikh ko jo camp lagegaa usamen sirf or sirf is baat kii jaankaree di jaaegi ki sarkaar se asalaah kaise len, iske liye kaise applai karen
 There will be no weapon training nor any type of weapon will be told

 436 Nangloi, NEW delhi,delhi,india 110041 In the ongoing Cauvery River water dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the Supreme Court on Tuesday directed Karnataka to give 6000 cusecs of water to Tamil Nadu by September 27
 saath hi supreme court ne kaveri menagement board kaa gathan karne kaa centre sarkaar ko nidersh diya
 The court set a deadline of 4 weeks to constitute the board, stating that the Center should have already constituted the board
 board ye nigaraanee karegaa or sunishchit karegaa ki tribunel ke rajyon ko pani ke bantwaare ke aadesh kaa paalan sahi se ho
 The next hearing in the case will be on 27 September
 karnataka sarkaar adaalat ke aadesh ko jhatka maan rahi he
 He says that 'this order is not correct
 isse rajya main pine ke pani ko tamilnadu ko dena hoga
 If we give water to Tamil Nadu, the situation in the state will worsen
 ' vahiin tamilnadu ne kaha he ki rajya main pani kii kami he or agar pani nahin milegaa to fasal kharaab ho jaaegi
 The comments haalanki suparvijri cameti ne teen hajaar kusek pani dene ke aadesh die the lekin supreme court ne ise dugana kar diya he
 In the previous hearing, the court had changed the judgment given on September 5
 adaalat ne karnataka ko aadesh diya tha ki vah tamilnadu ko 20 sitambar tak rojaanaa 12 hajaar kusek pani de
 In his earlier decision, he had kept this quantity of 15 thousand cusecs
 supreme court ne kaha tha yadi court ek baar aadesh paarit kar detaa he to sarkaar or logon ke liye ise maananaa anivaary hota he
 The Karnataka government argued in the court that the water being supplied to Tamil Nadu is being collected while Karnataka is currently struggling with the problem of drinking water
 adaalat ne board kaa gathan karne ke liye 4 hafte kii samaysima nirdhaarit karte hue kaha ki centre ko pehle hi board kaa gathan karnaa chahie tha
 The board will monitor this and ensure that the tribunal's state's water sharing order is properly followed
 maamle main agali sunwaayee 27 sitambar ko hogi
 The Karnataka government is dismissing the court order as a setback
 uskaa kahana he ki 'ye aadesh sahi nahin he
 This would give Tamil Nadu drinking water in the state
 ham tamilnadu ko pani denge to rajya main halaat bigadenge
 'tamil Nadu has said that there is scarcity of water in the state and if no water is available then the crop will be spoiled
 tippaniyan Although the Supervisory Committee had ordered to give three thousand cusecs of water, but the Supreme Court has doubled it
 pichhali sunwaayee main court ne paanch sitambar ko die gaye faisle main badlaav kiya tha
 The court ordered Karnataka to provide 12,000 cusecs of water daily to Tamil Nadu by 20 September
 apane pehle ke faisle main usne yah maatra 15 hajaar kusek rakhi thi
 The Supreme Court had said that if the court passes the order once, then it is mandatory for the government and the people to obey it
 court main karnataka sarkaar ne daleel di ki tamilnadu ko die ja rahe pani kaa sangrah kiya ja rahaa he jabaki karnataka is samay pine ke pani kii samasya se jujh rahaa he
 The Karnataka government is dismissing the court order as a setback
 uskaa kahana he ki 'ye aadesh sahi nahin he
 This would give Tamil Nadu drinking water in the state

 The Karnataka government argued in the court that the water being supplied to Tamil Nadu is being collected while Karnataka is currently struggling with the problem of drinking water

 The meeting was to decide whether to allow a joint venture of the Government Odisha Mining Corporation (OMC) and Vedanta Aluminum Limited to extract bauxite from the Niyamgiri hills
 vedanta landan stock exange main soochibaddh antarrashtriya khanan company vedanta resorcej kii ikai he jiske maalik arbapati anil agarwal hai

 orissa sarkaar ne 18 july or 19 agast ke bich in gram sabhaaon kaa aayojan kiya or sabhi ne isi aadhaar par khanan ko naamanzoor kar diya he
 District Collector Bijay Ketan Upadhyay of Kalahandi informed that 112 villages fall in the Niyamgiri mountain range, but the state government chose only 12 villages within a radius of one and a half kilometers for the gram sabhas as these villages fall in the mining zone
 is aitihaasik janamat sangrah kaa beej kendriya paryaavaran evam van mantralay ke agast, 2010 ke nirdesh se padaa, jisamen boxite mining project ko naamanzoor kar diya gaya tha
 The OMC challenged this directive in the Supreme Court
 court ne april main rajya sarkaar ko aadesh diya ki van adhikaar adhinium-2006 ke tahat gram sabhaayen yojit kar mining kii anumati dene yaa na dene ke bare main vanavaasiyon kii raay lee jaae
 The unanimous decision of the Gram Sabhas is not final, yet it will definitely have an impact on the decision of the Central Government to give the final approval of mining lease to forest and environment
 adivaasiyon kaa faisla nishchay hi vedanta ke liye bada jhatka he
 The company has set up Rs 5,000 crore to set up an alumina refinery with a one million tonne per annum capacity at Lanjigarh in Kalahandi
 invest kar chuki he
 Aluminum ore bauxite was to be obtained from Niyamgiri for this refinery
 company philhal anya rajyon se kaccha maal juta rahi thi
 The company closed the refinery in December last year due to a bauxite shortage, with production partially commencing in July
 aluminium rifinary kii kshamta badhaakar 50 lakh ton karne kii company kii yojana ke liye bhi niyamagiri main khanan behad jaruri he
 Despite this, the company is not disappointed
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad jari 2013 kii vaarshik report main vedanta resorcej ne kaha he ki sitambar tak mining kii manjuuri mil jane kii ummid he or do saal main boxite nikalne lagegaa
 According to the report, the company is also expected to get permission to expand the refinery by January 2014
 lekin unhone yah bhi kaha ki samay ko lekar koi bhi niyantran unke haath main nahin he
 a spokesperson for Vedanta Aluminum said that it was the responsibility of the state government to get bauxite
 rajya sarkaar ne company ko 15 karod ton boxite dilaane kaa vaada kiya tha or use lanjigarh rifinary ke liye aas-paas se kaccha maal dilaane main vedanta kii madad kerani chahie
 Odisha is the most prosperous state in the country in terms of minerals
 bharat kaa boxite kaa aadhe se adhik bhandar yaheen he or yah rajya desh main aluminium kaa sabase bada utpaadak he
 90 percent of India's chromite and more than one-third of iron ore deposits are also here
 isamen koi hairaani kii baat nahin ki rajya ko khanijon se moti kamai hoti he

 Like neighboring states, in Odisha, such projects are facing public opposition
 vedanta ke alaava dakshin korea kii steel company posco sahit kai companiyon ke saamne mining lij (khanan patte), paryaavaran evam van sambandhi manjuuri or jameen ke adhigrahan se judi samasyaayein pesh aa rahi hai
 On July 17, a day before the gram sabha meetings started, international steel company arcelormittal raised Rs 50,000 crore in Odisha
 kaa project radd kar diya tha
 The company said that even after six years of signing the initial agreement with the state government in December 2006, 1
 2 karod ton kshamta vaale is project ke liye jameen or louh ayask kii khaane lene main kamyaabi nahin mil saki he
 Critics say that the state government promised thousands of acres of land to various companies irrespective of the concerns of the local people
 sthaneey saamaajik kaaryakarta bijay kumaar babu kaa kahana he ki puure bharat main adivasee apni jameen par apana haq paane ke liye jujh rahe hai

 Rana Roy, a research scholar in forestry from the University of Toronto, Canada, was also present at the gram sabha
 unka kahana tha ki agar van adhikaar kanoon sahi dhang se amal main laayaa gaya to aage chalakar yah adivaasiyon kii dhaal ban saktaa he
 He also said that government officials and social organizations have not done anything special to give full knowledge of the law to the tribals
 roy ke anusaar, ‘‘adivaasiyon kii najar main yah kanoon unke adhikaar simit kar degaa jabaki vastav main aisa nahin he
 Rana is taking stock of the implementation of the law in Kandhamal and Deogarh districts of Odisha
 rishwat kaa virodh karne vaale group transperency international india ke board ke sadsy biswajit mohanti kaa kahana he ki orissa ke mining sector main pehali baar kuch javabdehi dikhaai de rahi he
 Mohanty had filed the first case in court a decade ago against Vedanta's project in Lanjigarh and Niyamgiri
 unka kahana he, ‘‘mining companiyaan adhikariyon or netaaon ko rishwat dekar khulla khel rahi hai
 Bhalchandra Sarangi, a local activist of the Communist Party of India (marxist Leninist), says that the gram sabhas have affirmed the personal, community and cultural rights of the forest dwellers
 unka maananaa he ki adivasee fruit processing unit jaise kisi project ke liye to raji ho sakate the, kyonki unhen apni van upaj kii bikri se kuch or paisa mil jaataa
 But what did they get from mining? But state government officials justify industrial and mining projects
 orissa ke khanan nideshaalay main dipti diarector (mins) umesh chandra jena kaa kahana he ki sirf teen fisadi jangal main mins hai jabaki sadak nirmaan, sinchai or transmishan projects ke liye isse kahin zyada jangal chahie
 In addition, trees can be re-planted on the ground of mines
 ve kehete hai, ‘‘novamundi main tata steel kii louh ayask mine or neshnal aluminium company kaa damanjodi project khanan ke baad ped lagaae jane kii misaalen hai
 Collector Upadhyay of Kalahandi says that the issue has been politicized badly, which has worsened the investment climate in the state
 unhen lagata he ki maovadi bhi adivaasiyon ke asantosh ko bhunaakar ilaake main apane paanv jamaane kii jugat main lage hue hai
 He said, "wherever there are reserves of minerals, the local residents will talk about worship according to their tradition, but the final decision should be taken by the state government
 ’’ unhone jor diya ki audyogic or mining projects ke jariye sthaneey logon ko hi phayda pahonchega
 Some sociologists also agree with him
 barsilona ke research liya temper or yuan martines-alior ne anvyrnmental justise orgenigeshans libileties and trade kii website par likhaa, ‘‘niyamagiri ko lekar chal rahi lambii ladaai ne kuch samasyaayein khadi kar di hai

 barsilona kii autonomas uniwarsity ke do research kaa sawaal tha, ‘‘aakhir sthaneey samudaayon ke paas kitna vito ho saktaa he? yah sampatti ke adhikaar kaa sawaal nahin he, kyonki jameen ke neeche ke khanijon par shashan kaa swaamitv hota he or jameen gaanv waalon kii nahin he
 Then what do the decisions of the gram sabhas mean to the mining industry? Has it laid the groundwork that will fuel the demand of similar mass courts to take decisions about industrial projects? It is possible
 lekin temper or martines alior kaa maananaa he ki is baat kii ummid bahut kam he ki isse kisi samudaay ko audyogic projects ke liye jameen ke istemaal ko dharmik aadhaar par vito karne kii anumati mil jaaegi
 For Vedanta and other companies trapped under similar circumstances, a lot depends on next year's Lok Sabha elections

 ' haadase bataakar nahin aate
 The same tragedy happened with the ruling BJP in Rajasthan in the assembly by-elections where it won only one out of four seats
 yah pradarshan kitna kharaab he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki disambar, 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main isane chaaron par achche antar se jeet hasil kii thi
 The parliamentary seats under which these assembly seats were held, were won by BJP candidates in the Lok Sabha elections also
 kul voton or vot fisadi main giravat bhi zyada he
 bjp's only seat, Kota (south), the margin of victory has come down to half
 in chaar maah main aisa kya badal gaya ki logon ne vipakshi ummidavaaron ko chun liya, jabaki ve jaanate the ki sarkaar main unke kahe kaa koi vajan nahin hoga or sattarudh party ke haathon unhen pratadit bhi hona pad saktaa he
 In general, it is rare for voters to vote against the ruling party in a by-election, even if there are still four years left in the assembly elections
 ho saktaa he, votaron ko pasand na aayaa ho ki isse pehle jis vidhayak ko unhone chunaa use sansad main bhej diya gaya
 Roughly one reason is understood that people wanted to shake the BJP government
 na sirf rajya main balki centre main bhi
 They wanted to tell the government not to take voters lightly
 agali baar jeetna he to kaam shuru kar do
 Yet the question is, why did Vasundhara Raje, who is winning the victory, failed to draw votes? The negligible participation of the state at the Center is also a reason for bjp's decline in public support
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apni cabinet main rajya se sirf ek rajyamantri ko chunaa jabaki yahaan se unhen 25 sansadeey siten hasil hui thim
 At the same time, Nihalchand Meghwal, who was elected in the Union Cabinet, was trapped in the alleged rape case
 isse yah sandesh gaya ki modi ne raaje kii puri tarah upeksha kar di he or rajya sarkaar ko unhone koi yojana yaa madad muhaiyaa nahin karai he
 This disinterestedness of the Center remains so far as Modi or party president Amit Shah has not taken any step that would make them understand that they are standing with Raje
 haal hi main ambit capital privet limited main institutional equities ke siio saurabh mukherjee ne rajya kaa daura kiya tha or unhen yahaan ke bankeron, niveshkon or vyapaariyon se ek hi pratikriya mili ki centre or rajya ke bich ke tanaav se log uhapoh main hai
 Raje, who has met Modi and Shah several times recently, has a lesson that he will have to work harder to overcome these shortcomings
 yah baat bhi samaj leni hogi ki upachunaavon main kharaab pradarshan kaa asar duusare rajyon ke aagaamee chunaavon par bhi padegaa
 Another issue is that of election management
 bijepi do siton par bahut kam antar se haari
 In Surajgarh seat, Shravan Kumar of Congress defeated Digambar Singh of BJP by 3,270 votes
 ve bahari ummidavaar the or unke chayan se party main baghawat ho gai thi
 Sarita Devi lost to Congress's Ramnarayan Gurjar by 386 votes in Nasirabad
 vair kii teesri seat par haar tay thi jahaan bijepi ne 82 saal ke ganga ram coli ko utaara tha jo bamushkil hi chal pate hai
 His ticket was mocked by the party's selection process
 yahaan congress ne unase kahin choti umr ke bhajanlaal ko jatigat sameekaran ke aadhaar par utaara tha
 bjp's Sandeep Sharma won in Kota because MP Om Birla worked very hard there and people still have not forgotten the tenure of Shanti Dhariwal
 party ne gulabchand kataaria ko gramin vikaas or panchayat mantri, pehali baar vidhayak bane arun chaturvedi ko rajyamantri or raaje ke virdohi onkaar singh lakhaavat ko heritage athurity kaa adhyaksh banaakar aresas ke pratinidhiyon ko cabinet main jagah di or sochane lagi ki isse aresas ke saath vah nibhaa le jaaegi
 She was wrong
 raaje sangh ke jin netaaon ke saath samvaad main hai unka prabhaav khatm ho chukaa he
 They have to go beyond these faces
 cabinet vistaar main ho rahi anaavashyak deree bhi ek masalaa he
 People feel that this is happening due to the conflict between Raje and the high command
 raaje ko yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki chunaav ke liye jis kor cameti par bharosa jataayaa tha, kya use badalane kii jarurat he? satta main aane ke baad do baar gahalot or ek baar raaje kii haar kii ek pramukh vajah hai:duusari qatari ke sakasham netaaon ko haq milane main deree
 Even if there are hundreds of mlas, the way to handle them is to start them from the minister to the chairperson, the post on which to sit
 is tarah teen saal ke baad inhen badal kar dusron ko bhi mauka diya ja saktaa he
 After all, why don't the Chief Minister do this? First, they want him to do every appointment
 doosraa, unhen dar rahata he ki yadi unhone kuch logon ko samahit kar liya to baaki baghawat kar denge
 That is why Raje has 46 departments
 kai kaarobaariyon ne india today ko bataaya ki samasyaayein hal karne ke liye unhen sambhddha mantri se baat karne kii jarurat he
 Obviously, the Chief Minister will not be available to everyone for every problem
 raaje ko apane kareeb aise logon kii jarurat he jo logon se sidhi baat kar saken
 The lack of able leaders to give them qualified posts is cooling the enthusiasm of the party and RSS workers
 raaje ek majboot prashaasak hai
 She wants to give active participation to the private sector
 do varsh baad rajya main behatar sadaken, skool or aspataal honge, lekin tab tak ek pratikul prabhaav bhi hoga
 For example, what Gulabchand Kataria or Education Minister Kalicharan Saraf have been saying about the inefficiency of school teachers is not wrong
 saare skulon ko kharaab sthiti main banaae rakhane kii bajaae ek kshetra ke kuch skulon main suvidhaon ko durust karne kaa sarkaar kaa faisla sahi jaan padataa he
 But by doing this Raje is getting entangled with a system that will initially oppose him
 unhen andaja he ki yah aakrosh kisi bhi vakt foot saktaa he
 That is why she is touring continuously
 raaje kii nigaah samooche kayakalp par he
 Their officers are engaged in ground work for this
 isse nijee shikaayatein, sthanantaran or vidhayakon se jude kaam atake pade hai
 Worst of all, the work on the three blocks in which he had traveled with the ministers and from where he received lakhs of complaints has not progressed
 kahin-na-kahin logon or party ke vafaadaaron ko yah ehsaas nahin ho rahaa ki unki hi sarkaar satta main he
 The nexus created by the Congress power at the grassroots and middle levels is still intact
 naukarshahi kii maansikta ko badalane kii samasya unke aade aa rahi he
 By the way, a small defeat in the by-election will not affect Raje
 ve apni yojanaon par kaam karti rahengi, haalanki ve ab yah sunishchit karengi ki logon kii shikaayatein yathasambhav hal hon
 The color of Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif's film 'bang Bang' is going up and speaking

 The locals were very happy to see their favorite stars Hrithik and Katrina during the shoot
 yahaan manali brij par film ke kai seen shoot kiye gaye hai
 For this reason, it has also become a favorite destination for tourists
 or ab iskaa naam badalakar baing baing point rakhaa ja chukaa he
 The director of the film claims that there will be a lively and surprising action in the film
 film main jabardast car chej or maar-dhaad he

 Every year tourists visit the tourist centers of the mountains and enjoy the climate of the place and leave a lot of garbage
 isse nijaat paane ke liye uttarakhand sarkaar ne ek nayaa niyam prastaavit kiya he
 As soon as it is implemented, a tour in the state can be a big hit on the pocket of tourists
 prastaav ke mutabik, hotel or restaraan jitna kooda paidaa karenge us hisaab se unhen tex dena hoga
 This tax is being introduced to discourage plastic waste which will be collected from tourists through hotels and restaurants
 van evam paryaavaran mantri harak singh ravat ke anusaar, isse swatchta ko to badhaava milegaa hi, saath hi rajasav bhi badhegaa
 In addition, the state government is considering banning the use of single-use plastic in all government offices
 sarkaar ne rajya main sabhi sarkari awaason main biodegradable apshisht padaarth kaa khaad bananaa bhi anivaary kar diya he

 ''haalanki, sarkaar kii ore se single yuj plastic kii theliyon par 2017 main laga pratibandh abhi bhi puri tarah lagu nahin ho paaya he or plastic kii theliyaan bazaar main aasaani se uplabdh hai
 The Green Tribunal's order on pilgrimage sites such as Haridwar and Rishikesh could also not be fully implemented that there would be a complete ban on plastics along the Ganges
 maharashtra or uttar pradesh ke baad uttarakhand teesraa aisa rajya he, jisane plastic par pratibandh lagaaya tha

" us aayojan main 326 quintal kooda paidaa hua tha
 Taking lessons from such examples, the EPPCB had taken up the matter of increasing pollution caused by tourists in a meeting with the Minister of Forest and Environment
 isse nibatane ke liye ravat ne rajya main 'plastic tex' lagane kii baat kahi thi
 He said, "unless such eco tax is imposed, we will not be able to muster the necessary financial capacity to protect the environment
" ''unhone bataaya, ''vasuul kii jane vaali raashi maidani ilaakon main kam or paharipoon main adhik hogi
 In the plains, we hardly spend 20 rupees for disposal of 1 kg of solid waste whereas in the hills we have to spend 40 to 50 rupees
 '' sutron ke mutabik, rajya sarkaar yah tex lagane par isliye bhi vichaar kar rahi he kyonki use nahin lagata ki uske green bonus ke prastaav ko centre se manjuuri milegi
 Some states like Himachal Pradesh already have a provision of green tax
 vahaan gaiyr-himachali number plate vaali gadipoon ko manali main pravesh ke liye green fees deni hoti he
 In 2009 in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, the municipality started charging eco fees from the people coming to the city
 lekin ek janhit yachika ke baad us par uttarakhand hycourt ne roak laga di thi
 The district panchayat Dehradun also imposed an entry fee when it came to Dehradun, which was canceled by the High Court
 vahiin, nainital or musuri main nagarpalikaayen malrod par aane vaali gadipoon se chungi ke naam se pravesh shulk vasuulati hai, jo unki aay kaa mukhya jariya he
 Now the government wants to collect the garbage tax through the municipal bodies, the hotel and restaurant owners have started opposing it
 nainital hotel and restaraan association ke adhyaksh dinesh saah kehete hai, ''sarkaar aisa koi tex chungi ke saath vasule
 We will oppose this on hotel-restaurants
 prashasan kii avyavashtha ke kaaran nainital or sameepvarti kshetra main 60 fisad kaarobaar ghat gaya he
 "at the same time, Sanjeev Bhagat, who runs Hotel Apple Inn in Bhawali Bhimtal, says," The municipality does not even cooperate with hotels to lift garbage in Bhimtal and Bhawali areas
 aise main unke jariye tex kyon vasuulana chaahati he
 However, the government will have to take concrete measures to control plastic and waste in ecologically sensitive hilly areas

 Saturday, November 9 morning 10 in the country's most talked about and controversial Ayodhya case
 30 baje supreme court apana faisla sunaane ja rahaa he
 After completing the hearing of the case, the country's top court reserved its decision
 tabhi se yah anumaan lagaaya ja rahaa tha ki CJI ranjan gogoi ke ritair hone se pehle is maamle main faisla aa jayega
 Chief Justice Gogoi retires on 17 November
 vaise to court kisi bhi din baith sakati he, maamle ko sun sakati he or faisla de sakati he lekin phir bhi 17 november ko ravivaar he or saamanyat: itane bade maamalon main faisla avkaash ke din nahin aayaa karata
 Also, the day in which Chief Justice is retiring, decisions are not usually pronounced in big cases
 isse pehle 16 november ko shanivaar kaa bhi chuttee kaa din he
 In such a situation, the last working day of CJI Ranjan Gogoi is falling on 15 November
 isse yah anumaan lagaaya gaya ki ayodhya maamle kaa faisla CJI gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali bench 14 yaa 15 november ko suna sakati he
 But, there was also a screw in it
 aam taur se adaalat kisi faisle ko sunaati he to usase sambandhit koi takneekee gadabadi par agle din vaadi yaa prativaadee main se koi bhi ek baar phir se adaalat kii sharan lekar is gadabadi ko dur karne kii guhaar lagaataa he
 It also takes one or two days
 is maamle main 14-15 november ko faisle kii sthiti main yah ek-do din phir khisak kar 16-17 november ho jate
 Despite this, neither the court nor the government, from any side, indicated that the verdict in the Ayodhya case could come before November 14-15
 phir achaanak, shuukravaar raat yah soochna aati he ki ayodhya maamle par faisla shanivaar subah saadhe das baje sunaaya jayega
 It is believed that this sudden announcement is part of this deliberate strategy that anti-social elements could not get a chance to prepare for any kind of crime in this very sensitive, emotion and faith related matter
 or, isiilie shuukravaar kii raat elaan kiya gaya ki ek raat ke katane ke baad shanivaar kii subah hone ke saath hi maamle main faisla suna diya jayega

 ' bataa den ki rahul gandhi kii yah tippanee is myne main ahm he ki 25 may ko hui congress kaarysmiti (seedblusi) kii baithak main unhone rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ko lekar vishesh rup se naaraazgi jaahir kii thi
 According to the source, Rahul Gandhi also said, 'I will no longer be the president
 
 
 party main loktantric prakriya honi chahie
 The responsibility should be given to someone else
 maine nae adhyaksh ke chunaav kii prakriya se bhi khud ko alag karne kaa nirnay liya hai
 i will be active in the party and will keep fighting the battles of your (youth) and people
 ' sutara ne kaha, 'rahul gandhi ne yah bhi kaha ki bujurg netaaon ko ab apane bhavishya kii chintaa nahin he, balki yuvaaon ko chintaa he isliye ab congress main bhavishya 45 varsh se kam aayu ke netaaon kaa he
 'let me tell you that in the meeting of the party working committee held on 25 May after the bitter defeat of the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi offered to resign from the post of the Speaker

 Indian cricket team has been announced for the World Cup 2019
 mumbai main baithak ke baad bisisiai ne 15 sadasyeey team kii ghoshnaa kii
 The command of this team has been handed over to Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will be the deputy captain of the team
 iske alaava dinesh karthik ko rishabh pant par tarjeeh dete hue bhartiya squad main jagah di gai he
 Young all-rounder Vijay Shankar has also got a ticket to England
 iske saath hi aise 5 khilaadi hai, jo vishwa cap team ke daavedaar maane ja rahe the, lekin unhen mauka nahin mila
 For the Rishabh Pantaviswa Cup, the team management has preferred experience over young Josh
 yahi vajah he ki visphotak ballebaaj rishabh pant ko team se baahar rakhaa gaya he
 Whenever Dinesh Karthik got the opportunity, he has attracted the attention of the team management with a great performance, so the selectors did not want to take any risk by keeping Pant with only 5 ODI experience
 pant visphotak ballebaaj to jarur hai, lekin vishwa cap jaise bade plateform main hai pressure halaat main kisi anbhavi khilaadi kaa maidan par rahanaa jaruri he, taaki vah mushkil sthiti main bhi team ke jeet dilaa sake
 Ambati was already struggling with the number 4 position in the Indian team for the Rayudu World Cup
 is jagah liye kedaar jadhav, ajinkya rahane, raidu or keel rahul ke bich res lagi thi
 But the team management and captain have given an opportunity to Kedar Jadhav, KL Rahul can also be used in the rest of the top order
 is team main raidu kii jagah jadhav ko mauka dene kii vajah unki gendbaaji he, jo kai maukon par alag kism kii phiraki se team ko mushkil vakt main wicket dilaa chuke hai
 Shreyas Iyer Young players captaining Delhi Capitals in IPL Shreyas Iyer were also considered contenders for the World Cup squad
 unhen kai maukon par team india squad main shaamil to kiya gaya, lekin unhen antim-11 main mauka nahin mila
 Due to this, he could not become entitled for selection
 umesh yadavaduniya ke number van gendbaaj jasprit bumraah or swing gendbaaj bhubaneshwar ko team main jagah mili he
 Apart from this, the responsibility of fast bowling will be on the shoulders of Mohammad Shami and all-rounder Hardik Pandya
 aise main umesh yadav kaa tikat cat gaya he
 Umesh could have been replaced by Shami in the squad, but the team management has relied on Shami for England's fast pitches
 anjiky rahanerhane ko bhi team india ke saath england kaa tikat nahin mil sakaa he
 Ajinkya Rahane's bat in the team was calm for a long time and he scored his last ODI century against West Indies in the beginning of 2017
 uske baad unhone 15 match khele, lekin unke balle se sirf ardhashatak niklaa
 In his place, Vijay Shankar has been given the opportunity, who can also bowl according to the need of the team
 yah yuva ballebaaj IPL main gend or balle donon se apni team ke liye yogadan de rahaa he
 Indian team Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma (vice captain), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Vijay Shankar, MS Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Kedar Jadhav, Dinesh Karthik, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jaspreet Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Mo

 People from many countries of the world tried to help in a 17-day campaign to rescue 12 children trapped in a dangerous cave in Thailand
 lekin is abhiyaan kii safalataa kaa credit lene kii kadavi ladaai shuru ho gai he
 Alon Musk, the famous billionaire businessman and founder of the spacex company, described a British diver as a pedophile (a sexist figurehead) who played a key role in the rescue mission
 gauratlab he ki iske pehle british diver (gotaakhor) varn ansaworth ne alon musk ke bachaav abhiyaan main shaamil hone ko 'piaar stant' (jansampark kii chalbaaji) bataaya tha
 This provoked Elon Musk
 asal main musk ne bachaav abhiyaan ke liye tub ke aakaar kii ek 'pandubbi' taiyaar karai thi
 He claimed that he personally entrusted it to the administration of Thailand and it helped to save the children
 british diver varn ko is duniya ke sabase behtareengotakhoron menshamil kiya jaataa he
 Criticizing Elon, Vern had said that the submarine could not be effective for rescue operations in Thailand's cave and that Musk had no idea what the inside of the cave was like
 tivi channel sienen ko die ek intervyuu main varn ne kaha tha, 'jahaan tak main samajhataa hum,sabamarine5 foot 6 inch lanbaa tha, isliye isse kisi kone yaa vyavdhaan se hokar le janaa mushkil tha
 It could not penetrate even 50 meters before the diving starting point
 yah sirf ek piaar stant tha
 Just a PR stunt
 'is ladaai ne kaaphi ghrunit rup le lee, jab is intervyuu se bhadke hue musk ne ek twit kar kaha ki ansaworth ek 'padophyle' vyakti hai
 Angered by Musk's remarks, Ainsworth told a newspaper that he was considering taking legal action against Musk
 aapkaa saathi har baat aapako bataata he, lekin phir bhi kai baar dusron se aapako jo baaten pataa chalati hai, ve sahi or sach hone ke baavjood aapaki jaankaree main nahin hoti
 So your partner very cleverly manages to hide things by winning your trust
 isliye samay ho chalaa he un se do kadam aage kii soch rakhane kaa
 Keep an eye on their fine movements and see the truth hidden within them
 agar aap yah soch rahi hai ki unke man kii baat aap kaise jaan sakati hai, to aapako bas unki harkaton kaa rakhana he puraa dhyaan
 Get on one side and keep an eye on them
 
 
 galaa to nahin suukhta na
 
 
 Go beyond the busyness of your work and look at their antics
 kahin aisa to nahin ki aapse kuch saaman lete hue yaa koi kaam kii baat karte hue unka galaa to nahin suukhta
 He would not get stuck again or be afraid
 agar aisa kuch bhi hota he, to yah kaaphi he yah tay karne ke liye ki vah sachmuch aapse kuch chipa rahe hai
 It is bad to give a very detailed description
 If for some days, he presents things in front of you in some detail, in this style, as if he is giving a clarification about something, then something is a mess
 is badlaav ko unka pyaar yaa aapse har baat share karne kii acchhee aadat na maane, kyonki is safai kii vajah aapke liye unke man kaa agaadh sneh nahin he
 They are trying to hide something from you
 tabhi to sabhi gairajaruri baton ko bhi detail main bataa kar aapkaa vishwaas jeetne kii koshish main lage hai
 Talk to them very polite and simple, such as everyday talk or any simple thing and check how easily they support you in all these things
 bistar par zyada samay
 
 
 If he is already taking more time in the bed and suddenly his inner desires have increased, then this is definitely good news for you
 lekin iskaa doosraa matlab bhi ho saktaa he, vah yah ki ho saktaa he ki ve kisi baat ko zikr laane se bachane ke liye aisa kar rahe hon
 Men who want to hide something from the woman, avoid avoiding women at the emotional level
 kyonki aisi paristhitiyon main vah apane man kii baat ko unke saamne khol kar rakh dete hai
 So be a little clever and even though they are getting hot, but do not stop talking to them after the relationship
 haath kahin jeb main to nahibgar ab tak ke sabhi sin kahin na kahin aapke saathi kii harkaton se match karte aa rahe hai, to ab saavdhaan hone kaa sahi samay aa chukaa he
 Pay full attention to them without delay
 dekhen ki kahin ve apane haathon ko baar baar jeb main to nahin le jate, to yah tay he ki koi to baat he jise vah aapse chipa rahe hai
 He is not necessarily carrying his hand in his pocket
 ho saktaa he ki ve apane haathon se baar baar apane sharir ke kisi bhi hisse ko chhuen, jaise qamar, gardan, sir yaa kuch or
 This is proof that he is hiding something from you
 isliye ab to aap unase puch hi len ki aakhir aisi koun si baat he, jo vah aapse chipa rahe hai
 In India Today Conclave 2016, Union Energy Minister Piyush Goyal announced that by 2019, DISCOM will start making profits in every state
 india today conklev LIVE dekhen2022 tak saura urja main 40 guna vruddhi karengepiyush goyal ne kaha, 'bharat aane vaale samay main bijli kii kami se bijli ke sarplus utpaadan kii taraf jane vaala desh hoga
 He said that the government is also very serious about solar energy
 ham saura urja ke kshetra main 2022 tak 40 guna vruddhi kaa target lekar chal rahe hai
 Know, when in the India Today Conclave, what is the 'country's first for PM Modi' Energy Minister praised the Prime Minister
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri modi under parfarmens or felyar ko lekar ashishnu hai
 As Goyal, 'PM Modi does not hesitate to criticize even about his leadership, but he always asks to think about the country first
 yah faisla bharat ke nyaayik itihaas main mile kaa pathar he
 It is hoped that this decision will resolve the dispute, which has been troubling India for the last 60 years
 is faisle kii sabase acchhee baat yah he ki peeth ke teenon jaj is baat par ekamat the ki babari masjid ke bich vaale gumbad, jahaan abhi murti rakhi he, vah jagah antim rup se hinduon ko di jaaegi
 In this way, the original question of the dispute has been resolved and there is no scope for dispute
 2 jajon kii raay thi ki is vivaadit jameen par musalamaanon kaa bhi haq he (us sthaan ko chhodkar, jahaan kabhi mukhya gumbad tha or abhi murti rakhi he)
 The judgment says that Muslims should get at least one-third of the land
 is prakaar court ne murti vaali jagah ko chhodkar vivaadit sthaan par musalamaanon kaa daawa bhi sweekaar kar liya he
 But i am jafarayab jilani ke us vaktavy se niraash hum, jisamen unhone is faisle ko supreme court main chunauti dene kii manshaa jaahir kii he
 They have every right to appeal to the Supreme Court, but i believe that Muslims as a community should realize that this is a historic moment in independent India
 is maukey par unhen faisla sweekaar karke aitihaasik udhaaharan pesh karnaa chahie
 History rarely gives us a chance to raise our level and set an example for the coming generation
 agar ve is faisle ke khilaaf apil na karne kaa nirnay karte hai, to yah sachmuch un sabon ke liye gauravshaalee kshan hoga, jo dharmanirpekshata or sarvadharm sambhaav main gahari aasthaa rakhte hai

 Missing you Ma- hope you are sharing our joy from somewhere out there— Sharmistha Mukherjee (@sharmistha_gk) January 26, 2019 Let us know that on the eve of Republic Day, President Ramnath Kovind gave Bharat Ratna to three eminent personalities including former President Pranab Mukherjee Had announced yah hindustan kaa sarvocch naagarik puraskaar he, jo asaadhaaran rashtriya seva ke liye diya jaataa he
 Apart from Pranab Mukherjee, Dr
 bhupen hajarika or nanaaji deshmukh ko bhi is puraskaar ke liye chunaa gaya he
 Dr
 Bhupen Hazarika and Nanaji Deshmukh are being posthumously given this highest civilian award
 vahiin, congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi, bhartiya janata party ke adhyaksh amit shah, pradhanmantri narendra modi or uparashtrapati venkaiya naidu samet kai diggaj netaaon ne bharat ratna die jane ko lekar pranab mukherjee ko badhai di he
 a decade ago, i and the eminent scientist C
 ve
 Seshadri was discussing the modalities of organization building
 unhone kuch halke-phulke andaaj main kaha ki unka man karata he ki apane haathon khadey kiye sanghathan chennai sthit murugappa chettiar research centre ko khatm karke use dobaaraa banaaya jaae
 To elaborate on his point, he said, "every trace of all the founders and old people should be erased, ending their relationship with the average heirs in between
" ’’ sheshadri kii yah baat ek vidambnaa kaa hi izhaar thi lekin ve iske jariye bharat ke bare main ek ahm samajashastreey asaliyat kii ore bhi ishaara rahe the ki yahaan ke log vyakti-kendrit sanghathan banane ke aadi hai
 It is a paradox that any organization takes the form of an individual in its narrow form
 jab sansthaapak mar jate hai, to ham unhen shaashvat banaae rakhane kii koshish main uttaradhikaar, sansthanikaran or santhnik tanebane ke vichaaron kaa galaa ghont dete hai
 Seshadri was referring to science-related organizations at that time, but he said that it is more accurate on political parties
 vyakti-kendrit yaa jise ekal netritv vaala dal kaha jaataa he, ek ajeeb parighatna he
 In this, collectivity is expressed in a person and the conduct and functioning of the person is a reflection of collectivity
 is tarah vah vyakti bataur netaa khud-ba-khud ek jeeta-jaagta sanghathan ban jaataa he
 In a sense he becomes an avatar
 sanghathan ke paas sirf ek hi aakhyaan apane netaa kii jeevani hoti he
 In sociological terms, organizations with charisma and hierarchy (eg, bureaucracy) are contradictory
 samaajavigyaani maiks webar ke mutabik karishma ataarkik, asthaayee or vyakti-kendrit hota he jabaki sanghathan taarkik, samuhik or nirvaiyaktik hota he
 When an organization indulges in its normal normal functioning, the charisma usually disappears from it
 donon ek saath nahin tik pate
 In India, however, organizations always exist around the leader
 us netaa kii urja hi samoochee party ko jode rakhti he
 As soon as the leader arrives, the organization suddenly becomes active at lightning speed
 bharat main netaa ek aisi garbhanal he jisase baaki sabhi judaav mahasoos karte hai
 In this way AIADMK becomes a party of millions of Jayalalitas, then there is Mamata in the Trinamool
 mamata kii jeevani hi sanghathan kaa itihaas hota he, mamata ke lakshya hi sanghathan ke iklaute uddeshy ban jate hai
 Person and leader become identical
 ise raajnneeti kii takat kahie yaa aadmi kii yaaddaasht kii takat ki mamata kaa myth, unki adad maujuudagi hi trinmul ko urjavan banaae rakhti he
 Years ago, when Devakant Barua gave the slogan "india is Indira, Indira is India", he was not only expressing the power of charisma, but also emphasizing the importance of sycophancy in our organizations here
 
 chatukaarita or nayak puja ke boote koi nayak itihaas rach saktaa he or kai kamjor jindagiyon main takat bhar saktaa he
 Not everyone can head a party with a leader
 aapako janata main lokapriy hone kii kuvat se badhkar asaamaanya or dussahasik karname karne kii sambhaavnaaen jagaani hongi
 Take Jayalalithaa itself
 ve film abhinetri thim jo mjiaar kii nayika ke taur par jaani jaati thim
 mgr's image became divine
 bhartiya raajnneeti main unhen chunauti dene se pehle ishwar ko bhi do baar sochna pad jaataa
 i remember once when they drank a cold drink, the leftover substance was sprinkled over the audience in such a way that it was holy water
 jayalalita usee myth kii abha se chamakati hai
 She gives a feeling of motherhood, but this feeling is not related to any family but to the whole society
 unki lakhon kinvadantiyaan hai
 God too would not have done much welfare of humanity, as much as he has done
 jayalalita kaa yah myth vyaavhaarik raajnneeti se paidaa hua he
 She is the only one, alone and this image can be destined only for a leader of a party with a leader
 mamata kii chhavi bhi aisi hi kinvadantiyon se milakar bani he
 She is an angry woman who is single-handedly fighting a war against CPM
 ve garibon kii maharani hai jinaki patibaddhta par koi aanch nahin he
 After all, who has the potential to convert the continuous protests into the functioning of the government? They are simple and their unique eloquence actually emerges from the power of their simplicity
 mamata or jayalalita ne hi ghar nahin basaaya he lekin donon satta yaa uske virodh main chandi kaa rup dhar sakati hai
 Both transcend the normal definition of good and bad
 ve har vakt aapako bhauchak kar sakati hai or apane samarthakon se puri bhakthi kii chahat rakhti hai
 There is a confluence of myth, living, anger in his personality that makes a normal man, an unemployed youth, a housewife or a student feel magical
 aise ‘‘ekal netaa’’ secular yaa saamaanya nahin ho sakate
 They must have a mixture of legends, myths, great qualities and magical feeling
 iske alaava inke saath teesri duniya kaa ek gun bhi judaa hona chahie
 Think of Cameron, Obama, and Trucup
 mamata or jayalalita kii vishaal hordigon ke saamne to ye sab ek maamuli katout jaise dikhte hai
 They express today's time and emotions
 lihaaja, unka vishleshan kisi aam netaa kii tarah nahin, balki manovigyaan se karnaa jaruri ho jaataa he
 Such a leader is a universe in itself where his supporters have a sense of belonging and meaningfulness
 aisi duniya main puja, chapalusee, bhakthi, sanak to hogi hi kyonki yahaan netaa nirankush bhi he or krupaalu bhi he
 Such a leader is the only power-center
 saajha sattayen patit ho jaati hai jabaki iklauta netaa ekta or ekaagratha kaa bhav paidaa karata he
 i am willing to place bets on the condition of the Center, but all regional leaders who have been around for a long time will come out of this mold
 centre jaise-jaise naukarshahi ke dhaanche main dhalataa jayega, hamaare kshetreey netaa uske virodh main apane dam par akele khadey honge, jo kendriya takaton or sanghathanon ke khilaaf honge
 And without myth, charisma, they would not be effective

 Input: IANS team india ke captain viraat kohli kaa fitness test 15 june ko hona he, jiske liye vah wif anoushka sharma ke saath bengalooru ke liye ravaanaa ho rahe hai
 For the last few days, the Indian captain Virat has been struggling with the problem of Kohlifness
 gardan main chot kii vajah se unki england daure kii taiyaariyon ko jhatka laga he or vah english county circuit main bhi nahin khel paaenge
 Kohli needs to pass fitness test for England tour only after this Kohli's fitness test will be able to confirm his availability in the limited phase of the limited overs tour of UK
 is daure kii shuruyaat june ke antim hafte main ireland ke khilaaf do tii-20 antarrashtriya maichon ke saath hogi
 This fitness test will prove to be an 'agni test' for Kohli
 aapako bataa den ki kohli is test ke liye taiyaar hone or feet hone ke liye kaaphi mehnat kar rahe hai
 Virat Kohli's tour of England was poor in 2014, but this time he is keen to improve his record
 1 agast se bharat ko england ke khilaaf 5 maichon kii test siries se pehle ireland ke saath 2 tii-20, england ke khilaaf 3 vanade or 3 tii-20 match khilne hai
 After the yo-yo test, the cards of Shami and Samson were cut and let you know that earlier fast bowler Mohammad Shami failed in the yo-yo Test at Bangalore's National Cricket Academy (NCA)
 jisaki vajah se unhen afghanistan ke khilaaf is aitihaasik test se baahar hona padaa he
 Apart from this, Yuvasanju Samson also dropped out of the india-a team going to England due to failure in the yo-yo Test
 yo-yo test main ab tak best sabit hue pandya-nairbhartiya team ne fitness test paas karne ke liye yo-yo test ko paimaana banaaya he jo khilaadi ke damakham or fitness kaa vishleshan karata he
 The current standard for India's senior and a team 16
 1 he
 According to the BCCI, Karun Nair and Hardik Pandya were the two best performing players in the yo-yo Test with a score of over 18
 kya kohli paas kar paaenge fitness test?ab yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki 15 taarikh ko hone vaale fitness test main viraat kohli paas ho pate hai yaa nahin
 Let us tell you that the statistics of the last few years show that Kohli has continuously sweated during this period
 pichley do saalon main bhartiya team dwaara khele gaye kul 95 antarrashtriya maichon main se 76 main vah team kaa hissaa rahe hai
 During this period, Kohli has played 25 Tests, 37 odis and 14 T20 matches
 pichley ek saal main to kohli bhartiya team dwaara khele gaye sabhi 9 test maichon main team kaa hissaa rahe hai
 Apart from this, he was part of the team in 29 out of 32 odis during this period
 saath hi is dauraan sabase zyada match khilne ke maamle main kohli keval rohit sharma or hardik pandya se peeche hai
 Both of them have played 48 international matches, while Virat has been part of 47 matches
 viraat ne in antarrashtriya maichon ke alaava pichley do saalon main ipel ke teen sijan main 40 match khele hai
 What is a yo-yo test? 
 Now understand the 'yo-yo' test too
 kai 'cone' kii madad se 20 meter kii duuri par do panktiyaan banaai jaati hai
 a player starts by placing his foot behind the line and starts running as soon as he gets instructions
 khilaadi lagaataar do linon ke bich daudta he or jab beep bajati he to usne mudana hota he
 The speed increases every one minute or so
 agar samay par rekha tak nahin pahunche to do or 'beep' ke antargat teji pakadani padati he
 The test is stopped if the player is unable to gain speed on two ends

 Madhya Pradesh is witnessing the heat of the year-end assembly elections
 bijepi ko satta main rahete 15 varsh ho gaye hai or vah aage yah silsilaa jari rakhana chaahati he, jabaki congress kii koshish satta main vaapasi kii he
 According to the sources, Congress general secretary and MP Kamal Nath can be given the command of the state by making him the president of the party MP
 bataa den ki kamalnath ke paas is samay haryana or punjab kaa prabhaar he
 According to the information, the name of senior leader Kamal Nath may be announced by the Congress for the post of Madhya Pradesh Congress President on Saturday evening
 baavjood iske pradesh main congress philhal chunavi chausar par najar nahin aa rahi he
 In the name of Jyotiraditya as CM, Kamal Nath had expressed that the main opposition party of the Congress is not taking the name of ending factionalism in the Congress
 digvijay singh, jyotiraditya sindhiya bhale hi chaahe jitna najadik hone kii baat karen, magar hakeekat kisi se chuphi nahin he
 Meanwhile, there is also news that MP Jyotiraditya Scindia may be made the head of the election campaign committee
 bataa den ki haal hi main varisht congress netaa or nauveen baar chhindwara ke saansad kamalnath ne kaha tha ki empi main agar jyotiraditya sindhiya ko siem phase ke rup main aage kiya jaataa he to vah iskaa swaagat karenge
 Vivek Tankha may get a big responsibility, while senior advocate and Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha may also get the responsibility of co-ordination in the party
 congress abhi na to mukhyamantri ke taur par kisi chehre kaa faisla kar saki he or na hi chunaav prabandh samiti ke bare main koi nirnay kar pai he
 Scindia on one side and State President Arun Yadav and Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh are definitely visiting and holding meetings
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki baaki chunaavon kii tarah party vidhansabha chunaav main mukhyamantri ke liye kisi kaa naam project nahin karegi
 The Congress is excited by the victory in the by-elections of the last four assembly constituencies, but the workers are waiting for when the high command clarifies the situation
 congress kaa bijepi par hamalaudhar, bhaajapa ke nae pradesh adhyaksh ke padbhaar sambhalate hi congress ne hamalaa bol diya
 Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh said that BJP has given Rakesh Singh command of the post of state president under the agreement
 abhi ve pradesh adhyaksh pad ke liye halake hai
 The bjp's path is not easy, the BJP has stepped up its efforts to create an environment that is tailored for itself for the fourth consecutive victory by taking initial steps on the political board
 yah isliye bhi he kyonki rajya main is baar kaa vidhansabha chunaav bhaajapa ke liye utana aasaan nahin mana ja rahaa he, jitne pichley teen vidhansabha chunaav the
 The reason for this is the atmosphere created against the party and the ongoing tussle within the party due to various incidents including farmer shootings
 bijepi ne chali shuruaati chalabijepi ne kamjor sabit ho rahe adhyaksh nand kumaar singh chouhan ko hataakar adhyaksh kii kaman saansad rakesh singh ko saunpi he, jo jamini raajnneeti karte hue saansad bane
 He has no differences with anyone in state politics, nor has he been identified with any particular group
 haalanki mahakaushal kshetra ke baahar unki bade netaa ke taur par pahchaan nahin he
 It is certain that he was once close to Prahlada Patel and Uma Bharti before

 agar mauka or dastur banataa to shuukravaar kii raat bijepi adhyaksh amit shah or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar mumbai main aasapaas thaharte

 While films like 'shuddh Desi Romance', 'aurangzeb' and 'idiots' have come up in the past years, once again the small town and low budget film 'dum Lagaake Haisha' with Ayushmann Khurrana has been released

 Story: This story is based on the 1995 Haridwar background of Prem Prakash Tiwari (ayushmann Khurrana) and Sandhya Verma (bhoomi Pednekar)
 prem ek audio casette kii dukaan main kaam karata he jo ki gayak kumaar sanu kaa bahut bada fain he
 He remembers only the songs of Kumar Sanu only when he was awake
 vahiin sandhya verma ek skool teacher he jiskaa vajan kaaphi zyada he
 Prem is very much afraid of his father (sanjay Mishra) because his father only seems to love love
 prem ke pitaaji ne apane dost se vaada kiya tha kii bade hone par prem kii shaadi sandhya se hi karaayenge or prem ko apane pitaaji kii baat maanakar baari bharkam sandhya ke saath vivaah karnaa hi padataa he
 Now love is a bit embarrassed by this marriage, but to keep the marital life ahead, keeps distance from the evening without saying anything to anyone
 sandhya puri koshish karti he prem ko khush rakhane kii lekin koshish naakaamayaab rahati he
 Amidst all these circumstances, Prem's mother asks Prem to take part in a special race where the husband will finish the race by hanging his wife on the back
 ab ye khaas mauka hota he jab donon kii dooriyaan nazdikiyon main tabdeel ho sakati hai

 And if Kumar Sanu's voice still attracts you today, then you must watch this film
 anu malik ke sangeet vaala 90 kaa daur aapako yaad aa jaayegaa
 It is Sharat Kataria's first film as a director and he has properly portrayed the theme of small town
 kyon naa dekhen:agar aap koi commercial film kii talash main hai , jahaan bade-bade set lage ho, tabadatod ection ho, bold seen kii bharmaar ho, romance or chote -chote kapadon main aapako adaakara dikhen

 modi sarkaar ke gathan ke baad sansad satr somvaar yani 17 june se shuru ho gaya jo 26 july tak chalegaa
 During this time, the Modi government will present the first budget of its tenure
 haalanki isse pehle loksabhaa adhyaksh or dipti spikar kaa chayan karnaa he
 Where BJP will keep the post of Lok Sabha Speaker
 vahiin, loksabhaa upaadhyaksh kaa pad par endie ke sahyogi shivasena daavedaari kar rahi he, lekin modi sarkaar sansad main apane agenda ko bina kisi rukaawat ke aage badhaane ke liye pichhali baar kii tarah endie se baahar ke dal ko ofer kar sakati he
 On the one hand, the nda's ally Shiv Sena has filed a claim for the post of Deputy Chairman in the Lok Sabha, on the other hand, by offering this position to the bjp's YSR Congress (YSRCP) of Jagan Mohan Reddy and Biju Janata Dal of Naveen Patnaik, who have performed well in Andhra Pradesh
 Wants to increase her clan bataa den ki 2014 main bhi bijepi ne aisa hi daanv chalaa tha jab AIADMK endie kaa hissaa nahin thi
 Despite this, the post of Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha was given to Thambidurai of AIADMK
 iskaa nateeja tha ki modi sarkaar ke kai ahm maukon par AIADMK saath khadi najar ai thi or 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main endie kaa hissaa banakar chunaav ladi thi
 Once again the BJP 2014 bet is on, but the Shiv Sena is also eyeing this position
 shivasena se yah netaa daavedaarshivsena ne loksabhaa upaadhyaksh pad par daawa jataayaa he
 Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had said that this is not a demand, but his right as being the second largest party in the alliance
 shivasena ke 18 saansad is baar jitkar aae hai
 In such a situation, if the BJP accepts the demand for the post of its deputy speaker, then the name of Vinayak Raut, Shiv Sena MP can be stamped
 maharashtra kii ratnagiri-sindhudurg loksabhaa seat se saansad vinayak raaoot kii ginati shivasena ke anbhavi netaaon main hoti he
 Earlier, his name was also going on to join the Modi cabinet from Shiv Sena quota
 lekin aakhir main arvind saamvat shivasena ke cote se modi sarkaar main mantri bane
 In this year's Lok Sabha elections, Vinayak Raut has reached Parliament by defeating Maharashtra Swabhiman Party candidate Nilesh Narayan Rane
 isse pehle 2014 ke aam chunaav main bhi vinayak raaoot ne jeet hasil kii thi or unhone congress pratyaashee neelesh rane ko maat di thi
 Here is YSR Congress from YSR Congress, who offered victory to Jagan Mohan Reddy's party YSR Congress in Andhra Pradesh
 andhra pradesh kii 25 main se 22 loksabhaa siton par wiesarsipi ko jeet mili he
 In this way, YSR Congress has emerged as the fourth-most party in this Lok Sabha with TMC
 jagan mohan reddy agar bijepi ke prastaav ko sweekaarte hai to unki party se do netaa dipti spikar kii res main shaamil he
 The name of his party MP Godetti Madhavi from Araku in Andhra Pradesh or Chinta Anuradha, MP from Amalapuram, may be proposed for the Deputy Chairman
 dilachasp baat yah he ki yah dono pehali baar saansad chune he
 Goddeeti Madhavi MP from Araku hails from tribal community
 jabaki chintaa anuraadhaa dalit samudaay se he
 Jagan Mohan Reddy will try to strengthen the caste equation of Andhra Pradesh in his favor by making either one of them deputy speaker
 bijedy se is netaa kii majboot daavedaribijepi loksabhaa upaadhyaksh kaa pad biju janata dal (bijedy) ko bhi de sakati he
 However, bjp's first attempt is YSR Congress and second is BJD
 aise main agar wiesar congress agar dipti spikar ke pad ko sweekaar nahin karti he to bijedy ko modi sarkaar yah pad de sakati he
 If the BJD chief and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik from Odisha accept the bjp's offer, then the name of MP from Cuttack Bhartrihari Mahtab may be stamped
 mehataab ko 2017 main sarvottam saansad ke puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Bhartrihari Mahatab Mahatab has been elected to the Lok Sabha for the sixth time
 aise main unki sansadeey anubhav ko dekhte hue unki daavedaari sabase majboot maani ja rahi he

 is dauraan unhone modi sarkaar jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 In response, Amit Shah has written an open letter of 9 pages to Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu
 apane khat main bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne na sirf silsilewar tareeke se chandrababu naidu ke aaropon jawaab diya he, balki modi sarkaar dwaara rajya ke liye kiye gaye kaamon ko bhi ginaya
 In his open letter to the people of Andhra Pradesh, Shah alleged that Naidu broke public confidence and that he was going too far with a personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 amit shah ne likhaa ki naidu kii ''chalaave kii raajnneeti'' samaapt hone vaali he
 The BJP president has written in his open letter that his party believes in the politics of performance and development
 rashtriya vikaas kii avadharana main andhra pradesh hamaare liye khaasaa mahatv rakhata he or yah is baat se bhi jhalkata he ki narendra modi sarkaar ne andhra pradesh ke vikaas va samruddhi ke liye har sambhav koshish kii he
 Hitting out at Naidu, Shah said that his party knew that the blood of the Congress was in Naidu's veins, but he (shah) never expected that he would overtake the Congress in lying and the central government, Modi And will run a "hate campaign" against the BJP
 andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri ne congress sadsy ke rup main apni raajnneeti shuru kii thi or baad main apane sasur en tii rama raav dwaara banaai gai party tedepa main shaamil ho gayi the
 The BJP president wrote that he took many U-turns in the upcoming elections, sensing defeat and he is running a malicious campaign against the Center and BJP leadership to divert attention from his failures
 apane khat main shah ne chandrababu nadyu ko purana vakt bhi yaad dilaayaa
 Recall the last Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha (during the UPA government) when you did not have the strength of more mps
 tab bhaajapa ne hi donon rajyon ke telegu bhashi logon ke nyaay ke liye aawaaj buland kii thi
 During this, he also reminded Naidu and the people of Andhra Pradesh of the work that the central government has done in the state
 amit shah ne likhaa ki bijepi kii aguwai main saal 2014 main endie kii sarkaar bani, jiske aap bhi ahm hissedaar rahe
 We worked to advance Andhra with the feeling that this state has suffered much of partition
 centre sarkaar ne andhra ke vikaas ke liye jis tarah se kaam kiya, usamen samvedansheeltaa or patibaddhta donon hai
 All this is reflected in the huge support given to Andhra during the last four years
 yahaan tak ki andhra pradesh ri-orgenigeshan act 2014 ke tahat kiye gaye zyaadaatar vaayadon ko bhi puraa kar liya gaya he
 Amit Shah wrote- BJP always does politics of such development, which will bring positive changes in the lives of common people
 pichley chaar saalon main jis tarah se hamen deshbhar se janata kaa aashirwad hasil hua he, usase hamaare sakaaratmak agenda ko bal mila he
 Your allegation that the BJP is not fulfilling the aspirations of the people of Andhra Pradesh is utterly wrong and baseless
 unhone aage kaha, ek nae rajya ke rup main andhra pradesh ko khaas madad di gai, taaki ek nae rajya kaa aarthik vikaas teji se ho sake
 The way the Central Government and BJP have worked in the last 4 years, it shows that the BJP is the true well-wisher of Andhra Pradesh and its people
 dilli kaa dangal ab dilachasp hota ja rahaa he, kahin nasibavaale or badanaseeb vaale par bahes chhidi hui he to kahin vigyapanon ko lekar vivaad chhidaa hua he
 At a paan shop, two elders were discussing that brother Naseeb is all his own
 is par kisi kaa koi vash nahin hota aise main kisi ko badanaseeb kahana kitna uchit he
 The debate continues with a sip of election tea
 ab baat kuch vigyapanon kii
 
 
 The first controversy occurred when Anna's photograph was garlanded in an advertisement
 ab jo taaja vivaad hua he usamen arvind kejariwal ko andolankaaree or updravi grotra kaa bataaya gaya he
 Kejriwal also did not let this opportunity go and associated this unruly gotra with his caste
 kejariwal bhi ab raajnneeti samaj gaye hai
 He is aware that his caste i
e
 Baniya is traditionally considered as the backer of BJP
 aise main apane upar kiye gaye hamale ko baniyaa jati ke apmaan se jod diya jaae or puri baniyaa samaaj se maafee maangane kii baat kahi jaae to raajnneeti garma sakati he
 But the biggest question is why the BJP has to resort to such controversial advertisements
 kya party nervas he yaa bijepi ko lagata he ki bahumat ke aankade se vah dur he
 Daily press conference of two Union Ministers
 
 
 roj kejariwal se paanch sawaal, 70 vidhansabha ke liye 120 saansad yani bijepi ne sari takat jhonk di he
 On the other hand, Kejriwal is challenging Kiran Bedi every day to come and argue with me
 bijepi kii is sena se team kejariwal pili padi he or yahi vajah he ki dilli kaa yah dangal loksabhaa chunaav se bhi dilachasp ho gaya he
 This will be the most popular election to be fought in the country in recent times, this Mahamukabala will be even more fun in the next four to five days
 aam aadmi kaa kaaryakatta josh se bharaa he, yuva he, garib he
 At the same time, BJP has confidence in its organization, middle class and Sangh cadres as well as the Prime Minister's charisma and Amit Shah's skills
 jaisaa ki bijepi ke vigyaapan main pradhanmantri kehete hai ki jo desh ke dil main hota he, vahi dilli ke dil main hota he
 Amidst all this, the Congress is hoping that once again there will be a hung assembly and it will remain in the discussion again
 abhi pradhanmantri kii do reliyaan or honi hai
 If you look at the figures of Lok Sabha elections, BJP should get 60 seats in this election
 magar utani badi lahar is baar dikh nahin rahi
 According to Lok Sabha data, the Aam Aadmi Party was ahead in only 10 seats, but now it is not so
 party ek dam takkar de rahi he
 But the truth is that the party which pulled its voters to the booth on election day will be the winner
 aaj deshbhar main hindi diwas manaaya ja rahaa he
 On this occasion, Home Minister Amit Shah emphasized the ability of Hindi language to unite the country and said that it is necessary to have a language that can represent India in the world
 hindi diwas ke avasar par, amit shah ne kaha ki vyapak rup se boli jane vaali hindi vah bhashaa he jo bharat ko ekajute rakh sakati he
 He tweeted that "india is a country of different languages and every language has its own importance but it is very important to have a language that becomes India's identity in the world
" agar ek bhashaa aaj desh ko ekajute kar sakati he, to yah vyapak rup se boli jane vaali hindi bhashaa he
 "india is a country of different languages and every language has its own importance but it is very important to have a language of the whole country which should become the identity of India in the world
 aaj desh ko ekta kii door main baandhane kaa kaam agar koi ek bhashaa kar sakati he to wo sarvaadhik bole jane vaali hindi bhashaa hi he

 pehle dillividhansabha chunaav or phirloksabhaa chunaav donon main hi congress phiseddi sabit hui
 But this time changing Congress, the Congress fielded Ajay Maken, who is going to face Jokiran Bedi and Kejriwal
 maakan ke saath plus point he unki saaf chhavi
 There is also no anti-incumbency factor like Sheila Dixit against her
 maakan par jimmedaari yahi he ki ve congress ke hataash votaron ko waapas joden, jo aam aadmi party se jud gaye the
 There are also some other challenges - 1
 dahaai main pahunche sitensbase badi chunauti philhal ye he ki siton kii sankhya dahaai main na ho sake to bhi pichhali baar kii aath siton se kam na ho
 Strategy is made in both cricket and politics - but the outcome is never sure
 haarane jaisi haalat main cricket captain jaise-taise match drow karaane kii koshish karata he
 If this formula was applicable in politics too, Ajay Maken would have tried to take full advantage of it
 2
 Ajay Maken has discovered a new formula for the battles of 'trusted' and 'tested' for Kiran Bedi and Kejriwal
 saarvajanik taur maakan sweekaar karte hai ki kiran or kejariwal donon ‘tested’ hai lekin samajhaate hai ki donon hi ‘trusted’ nahin hai
 Kejriwal describes Maken as a fugitive and a retractor of promises
 iske liye unhone ek bocolate bhi jari kiya he, jiskaa tital he - '49 din kii ulti chaal, dilli hui behaal, you-turn kejariwal’
 Maken makes a different argument for Kiran Bedi being incompetent in terms of governance
 ve kehete hai, ‘kiran bedi acchhee pulicekarmi thim
 However, political administration requires a completely different capability
 dhairya kii
 Everyone has to listen
 ’ bijepi jwine karne ke baad se hi surkhiyon main raheen kiran bedi kaa mangalvaar ko bich main hi tivi sho chhod kar chale janaa maakan ko apni baat samajhane main madadgaar sabit ho rahaa he
 3
 siyasat yaa maukaparasti kaa sawalkiran bedi or kejariwal, anna kii bhrashtachar virdohi muhim ke do chehre the
 When it came to politics, they both parted
 pehle kejariwal ne party banaai
 Later Kiran Bedi joined BJP
 dilli kii gaddi ke liye ab donon aamane-saamne hai
 Maken is describing both as opportunistic
 ve kehete hai, ‘ye donon netaa samaan avasarwaadi takaton kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Both used Anna Hazare and the corruption issue to move forward
 isse pehle ve ek enjio kii aad main the or ab ve apni raajnneetik mahatvakanksha puri karnaa chaahate hai
 '4
 bahes kii bahes main ghuspaithkejariwal ne kiran bedi ko khuli bahes kii chunauti di to unhone ise drama bataate hue naamanzoor kar diya
 Seeing the opportunity, Ajay Maken jumped in the middle and tweeted, 'I am ready for an open and constructive debate
 is bahes ke bahaane dilli kii janata ko tulana karne kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 'there may not be a debate, but people should understand that Kejriwal is also ready, Maken is also ready
 agar koi bhaag rahaa he to wo hai – kiran bedi
 At a time when the battle for Delhi's chair seems to be confined around Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal, Maken is fighting for the Congress' survival
 10 farvari ko agar bijepi or aap donon bahumat se dur rahe or congress kii jholii main kuch siten aa gayi to pichhali baar kii tarah unki party is laayak to ho hi jaaegi ki khel bana yaa bigaad saken

 pradooshan kam karne ke liye kejariwal sarkaar ne 2016 main is kaarykram kii shuruuaat kii thi
 However, BJP has been aggressive since this
 guuruuvaar ko kejariwal sarkaar ke od-evan ke virodh main chaalaan katwane vaale dilli bijepi ke netaa vijay goyal paraali lekar sadakon par utre
 Vijay Goel had reached the residence of Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia with his supporters with a stroller

 Pollution is taking place in Delhi between the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP over pollution
 dedh minute main daakhil yachika par sunwaayee khatmaisse pehle sitambar main od-ivan ke dilli sarkaar ke faisle ko chunauti dene vaali yachika par engiti kii principal bench ne sunwaayee kii thi
 The hearing on this petition ended within one to one and a half minutes and the petitioner had also withdrawn his petition
 darasal, sunwaayee ke dauraan dilli sarkaar kii taraf se pesh varisht adhivaktaa sanjay jain ne kaha tha ki ye ek gaiyr jaruri janhit yachika he, jise sirf media atension paane ke liye court main daakhil kiya gaya he
 This petition lacks seriousness
 isamen sunwaayee ke yogya kuch bhi nahin he, sirf od-evan ke virodh ke liye yah yachika lagaai gai he, jisamen koi thos aadhaar bhi nahin he, lihaaja ise khaarij kiya jaae

 The Air Force said in a statement that the objective of this exercise is to test coordination, deployment in air strength in the event of an early and fierce war

 In 1920, architect Edwin Lutyens stood atop Raisina Hill
 garmiyon kii us chamakati dhoop main unhone purab kii ore pasre ilaake ko dur tak dekha, jo keekar or choti jhaadipoon se dhanka tha
 This place was to become the site of the last grand building to stand in his planning
 ve vahaan kaaphi der tak khadey rahakar apane dimag main us bhavy yojana kaa khaakaa taiyaar karne lage, jise ve agle do dashak main puri karne vaale the
 It was a plan for a building that would go on to become the most sacred and revered place of the Indian capital
 ab jabaki is yojana ke ngraks 21veen sadi ke maanakon ke anuroop ek nai imaarat taiyaar karne kii yojana kaa khaakaa khinch chukaa he, aise main balua pathar se nirmit is nagarkot—ek jyamiti main bane north or south block, alag abha vaala vysaroy house, shandaar golakaar sansad bhawan, utsavi udyaan or india get jaakar khatm hoti sadak—kii aakhir kya praasangikta bachati he? kya prastaavit sanshodhan imaarat ke itihaas ke anuroop hai yaa iske khilaaf padate hai? modi ke bharat or lutiuns ke samay ke bharat main kya koi samya he?sach puuchhie to nammaatr kaa
 Start at the Viceroy's House
 ise shahar kii bheedbhad se hatakar kuleen angrejon ke banaae jane vaale aaleeshaan gharon country house kii tarj par taiyaar kiya gaya tha or ise banane vaala yah vaastukar angreji country house dizin kaa visheshgy tha
 Its wide wings include bedroom suites, interior courts, a grand ballroom, library, state dining hall, space for cooks and kitchens, a cinema hall apart from storekeepers, private servants, sweepers, barbers, tailors, painters Houses are built for the etc
 linen, chini mitti ke bartanon, kaanch, kaaleen or furniture ke bhandaaran ke liye iske base floor main ek bada bhandaaran kaksh bhi he
 Its architecture sees a beautiful combination of the formality of the grandeur of an English country house and the domestic character of a Mughal palace
 iske vishaal kshetra or sevaaon ke keval ek chote-se hisse kaa hi upyog iske maujuuda nivasee yani raashtrapati dwaara kiya jaataa he
 So should the unused portion of the building become a museum? The Museum of Imperialism? The South and North blocks on either side of its entrance were built as a symbol of the importance of civil services
 ye koi bahut bade mahatv kii imaaraten nahin thim
 His architect [herbert] Baker called them 'buildings of dignity', which 'avoided the vulgar and useless Vastu of Hindus'
 vishaal pattharon se bane in daftaron ke bheetar ab ujaad khandhar jaisaa ehsaas hota he
 These buildings were built at a time when land was cheap and high-rise windows-skylights were built to keep these buildings cool
 aaj ye kaaphi vistaar le chuki naukarshahi kii jaruraton ko bamushkil puri kar paati hai
 On the other hand, they are more useful as playgrounds for the pigeons and monkeys of the area
 prastaavit dizin main sachivalay ko rajpath se lagi ek nai imaarat main le jaaya jayega jabaki baker kii banaai sanrachanaayen bharat ke itihaas kaa jashn manaate sangrahalayon main parivartit ho jaaengi
 Often, the concern for conservation promotes a narrow attitude in which historical structures are easily converted into museums or heritage hotels
 haalanki, sarkaar ne is puure central vista ke punarnirmaan kaa kadam mukhya rup se sansad bhawan ke kaaran uthaaya tha
 Yet out of this entire group of buildings, this is the only building that continues its work in its entirety
 suraksha, media or sanchaar ke adhik staron kii maang ke alaava, donon sadanon ke kaksh acchhee tarah se susajjit hai or avaagaman aasaan he, anaupchaarik charchaaon or baithkon ke liye atirikt sthaan bhi uplabdh ho jaataa he
 The veranda, courtyards and elaborate galleries all seem to take into account the idea that political decisions are made in 'these corridors of power'
 phir dikkat kya aa rahi he? puraane ke saath-saath sujhaaye gaye nae parisar ko keval is dharna par bahut bada banaaya ja rahaa he ki bhavishya kii sansad ko adhik saansadon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Clearly, the size cut of the government is not even in the thoughts
 lutiuns ke samay se hi, praathmik parivartan rajpath ke aayojan sthal main hi he
 This linear site, with long expansive pools and trees along its banks, seized public space that represented nothing but power
 isane bhavy smarakon ke vichaaron ko or protsaahan diya or raisina hill par gulabi vaastukala ko or adhik adhikaaravaadi bana diya
 Lutyens would never have imagined that a century later, their beloved India Gate would become a raucous daily marketplace that would take the form of a fair from vendors, ice cream-carts, informal boating
 saarvajanik sthal kii samgr sanrachana main dekhen to rajpath kabhi bhavy shahari mahatv kaa parikshetra hua karata tha, ek myne main washington disi ke mal or paris main shamp elicy jaisaa
 In its 100-year history after construction, many aspects were added to it
 yah ek nae swatantra hue desh kii rajdhani main kisi bhi mahatvapurn saarvajanik kshetra main apekshit bhi tha
 Most of the other ministries structures built around date to the 1950s and 1960s
 nirvivaad rup se inamen se harek raisina hill par maujuud apni purvavarti imaarat kii garib chacheri bahanen lagati hai
 Every building is far from Lutyens' established tradition of grand design, quality and workmanship of construction
 to ab aise main rajpath se bhala kisi tasviir ubharani chahie? nae sansad bhawan kaa aakaar kya hona chahie? kya isi kshetra ke bheetar pradhanmantri kaa nivas sthaan banaae jane se mantriparishad ke saath unka behatar samanvay sthapit karne vaala hoga? dizin kaa kaam ab chunki saunpa ja chukaa he, to iske jawaab nishchit rup se jald hi saamne aaenge
 However, there is a rage among architects that how such work of international importance was handed over to anyone without public scrutiny and debate? They are also demanding a rethink on this
 ek aisi sarkaar jiskaa kaarykaal ek choti samyavadhi kaa hota he, vah ek tahjeeb kii bhavi viraasat ke bare main itnaa bada nirnay aise kaise le sakati he? duniya ke anya deshon main, is tarah ke kisi pramukh badlaav se pehle use logon ke bich vyapak charchaa ke liye rakhaa jaataa he or aam sahmati ke baad hi kuch nirnay hota he
 All public works in France are decided through a national design competition
 lekin aise desh main jahaan saarvajanik maamalon main paardarshita abhi bhi puri tarah se videshi adarsh he, vahaan aisi aashaa rakhana jarurat se zyada ummid rakhane kii baat hi hogi
 Does Lutyens and its architecture hold any place in Indian history? Do we really care about those architects who tried to look beyond the 'ugly architecture of Hindus' but still managed to build huge stone structures? Perhaps this is why we have been honoring and preserving the old fort, the Konark Sun Temple and the Gateway of India
 aisi sanrachanaon ko dobaaraa kabhi bananaa to dur, unki kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati
 Sadly, a new stream of thinking is now emerging, a stream that treats these old buildings in the same way as with history books, writing new writings with new things
 kai baar itihaas se sabak lene se zyada aasaan use phir se likhnaa yaa gadhia hi ho jaataa he

 He called this report positive for Bihar

 While discussing with journalists in Patna on Thursday, he gave the Union Finance Minister P
P
 chidambaram ko is report ke liye dhanyavad diya
 The Chief Minister said that it would have been better for the committee to assess the backwardness of these states rather than per capita consumption as per capita income
 unhone is report ko janata dal (united) ke siddhant kii jeet bataate hue kaha ki yah report vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane jaisaa hi he, kyonki yah kendra dwaara aarthik madad milane or karon main chhot main madad karegaa

 Another 14-year-old girl told that whenever "hunterwale Uncle" (brajesh Thakur) came to the shelter, the girls would tremble in fear
 ek 10 varshiya balika ko yaad he ki balaatkaar se pehle use kaise nashila padaarth khilaayaa gaya tha
 His unconsciousness opens with pain in private parts of his body and he also sees bruises

 The victims have identified Brajesh Thakur, owner of Seva Sankalp and Vikas Samiti, the NGO that runs the shelter home, as one of the rapists
 ek ladki ne to thakur kii tasviir par thook bhi diya
 The girls said that whenever someone opposed Thakur's antics, he was subjected to unbearable torture

 TISS submitted its report in the month of April
 phir bhi pradesh ke saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag praathmiki ko is par exiar darj karaane main ek maheene lage
 On May 31, an FIR was lodged against 11 people, including Thakur, who runs the Service Resolution and Development Committee

 a seven-year-old girl somehow told that almost everyone exploited her

 Eventually he had to surrender to please Thakur

 One girl told the court, "I was unable to walk properly due to repeated rape by NGO officials and some outsiders
 '' usne yah bhi kaha, "kabhi-kabhi, to badi ladakiyon ko raat main baahar bhi le jaaya jaataa tha
 "one 11-year-old girl identified her rapist as" Tondwale Uncleji "while the other one identified as" Mustachewale Uncleji "

 This endless round of torture with girls would have continued if the TISS team had not been knocked here under the social audit program
 use puure rajya main 110 aashray grihon ke saamaajik lekha pareekshan ke liye niyukt kiya gaya tha
 How close Thakur's strong nexus with the government was evident in the TISS report filed in the month of April indicating sexual abuse with the girls at the shelter home
 lekin police ne thakur ke enjio ke khilaaf 31 may ko exiar darj kii
 Moreover, on the same day he was also approved to run a shelter home for beggars
 lekin 3 june ko saamaajik kalyaan vibhaag ne aanan-fanan main nayaa project radd kar diya

 Initially, the officials of the Social Welfare Department in Muzaffarpur objected to Thakur's proposal to run a girls' shelter in the morning in the building of Kamal (hindi daily owned by Thakur)

 The selection committee of Muzaffarpur was against the approval of Thakur's project, but senior officials in Patna allowed Thakur to run a small shelter home for girls in the same building

 unhone seva sankalp evam vikaas samiti ke praaanpatron ke bare main bhi poocha
 On August 2, the Supreme Court, taking suo motu cognizance of the matter, issued notice to the Government of Bihar and the Ministry of Women and Child Development
 supreme court ne media ko bhi in peedit ladakiyon ke kisi bhi tarah ke dhundhale photo or video jari na karne ke nirdesh die
 Not only this, media has also been banned for interviewing any victim girl

 police ne 10 logon ke khilaaf aaropapatr daayar kiye hai, jinhen pehle hi giraftaar kiya ja chukaa tha
 The process of declaring Verma as a fugitive criminal has also been initiated

 He had risen to a higher position than a minor social worker
 ek ladki ne bataaya ki "head sar'' uske nijee angon par lohe kii rod se maarthe the
 The police's Supervision report stated that "girls" living in the shelter home were earlier beaten for forcing them to sleep with the female employees of the shelter home
