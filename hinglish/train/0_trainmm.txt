 They knew that not everyone is happy with the reforms, in which i can do nothing
 yah to mujhe desh hit main karnaa hi tha
 He also clarified that the shortfall in the cases in which he failed was that of the administrative ministry concerned
 iskaa unke mantralay se koi lenaa dena nahin he, ham to nyaayalay main sarkaar kaa cheharaa maatr hai
 He did not explicitly mention various issues but his reference was to the government's gritty before the court in the 2G scam, black money and Salwa Judum case
 unhone kaha, ‘duusare mantralayon ke galat kaamon ke liye vidhi mantralay ko dosha nahin diya ja saktaa
 Moily said that he has taken several steps for reforms in the Law Ministry and plans are underway on schemes worth Rs 21,000 crore

 unki maang thi ki jab tak bijli kii badi hui daron ko waapas nahin liya jaataa vah dharne par baithe rahenge

 in / bulletinboard / news-events / latest The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, who has been seeking to resolve the Kashmir problem through dialogue till now, has turned back
 sanyukt raashtra aam sabha kii baithak main unhone phir jammu-kashmir main janamat sangrah kii baat uthaai
 He said clearly that the people there should have the right to choose their own country and it is the duty of Pakistan to help them in this
 itnaa hi nahin unhone pichley dinon bharat dwaara pakistan se baatcheet radd karne ke faisle kii bhi ninda kii or kaha ki bharat ne ek mauka ganvaa diya
 The truth is quite the opposite
 bharat ne hameshaa pakistan se baatcheet kii ichha jataai or iskaa samaadhaan dhundhane kii koshish kii
 But Pakistan continued to govern in that too
 bharat hameshaa udaar bhav se kashmiri hurriyat netaaon ko pakistani netaaon se baatcheet karne kii ijaajat detaa rahaa he lekin vah iskaa bhi nazaij phayda uthaata rahaa he
 He greatly encouraged the terrorist elements there and never let the situation improve
 ab vah phir kashmir main janamat sangrah kii baat uthaa rahaa he jabaki shimla samjhaute main saaf taur se zikr he ki donon desh milbait kar iskaa ek sarvamaanya samaadhaan nikaalenge
 The agreement states that the two countries will cease conflict and conflict and promote friendly relations so that there is lasting peace in the continent and both can invest their energy and resources for the welfare of the people
 jaahir he iske baat kisi tarah ke nai vyakhya kii jarurat nahin he
 But now Sharif has given a new twist to the matter and has also accused India that India is not only oppressing the people but oppressing women
 jaahir he ki sharif ne bharat ko gunahagaar tehra kar duniya kii najaron main vaah wahi luutane kii badi ghatiya koshish kii he
 Till now, he was expressing that it is his preference to be friends with India, but his poisonous words do not seem to interest him
 unka yah bayaan to pakistani ke unmaadi tatwon kii tarj par he
 Actually, the problem of Nawaz Sharif is that he is surrounded all around in his country
 un par vipakshi dalon kaa dabaav he ki ve istipha den, desh main aatankwaadi puri tarah se sakriy hai or fouj uttari ilaakon main unase ladaai lard rahi he
 Not only this, Pakistan is financially bankrupt and is relying on donations from the US and China
 vahaan garibon kii haalat bahut kharaab he or alpsankhyakon kii roj hatya ho rahi he
 That means a completely failed country
 ab navaj sharif ne desh main apni aalochana se bachane ke liye yuan main bharat ke khilaaf jehar ugalkar or kashmir kaa mudda uthaakar vahaan vaah-wahi luutane kii ek koshish kii he
 It is well known that Sharif's government has weakened and it is not clear when he will leave
 isliye vah aise bayaan de rahe hai ki desh main unki saakh bade or vahaan ke vikshubdh tatv unki ore se apni nigahen hataa len
 He has clearly taken off and thrown away Sharafat so that not only the public but also the army are with him
 sabhi jaanate hai ki pakistani fouj ko hameshaa bharat se tanaav paidaa karne main phayda dikhataa he
 She wants to capture the power there
 vah nahin chaahati he ki bharat se koi shanti ho
 She wants that tension prevails in both of them and hence she continues to pressurize the elected government as well
 is samay sharif ko fouj ke sahyog kii jarurat he or unka aisa bayaan vahaan ke generalon ko khush kar degaa
 It is clear that Sharif has thoughtfully decided that he will take the path of tension rather than dialogue
 unhen apane astitv kii ladaai ladani jo he

 sena ke is netaa ne aarope lagaaya, 'yadi raashtra virdohi yah fatwa kendriya grih mantri kii maujuudagi main jari kiya gaya to is raashtra kaa koi bhavishya nahin he
 This shows that the policy of the Center is to cash in on Muslim votes
 'aise fatve hindu-muslim tanaav ko badhaate hanunhone kaha ki vandemataram keval do shabd nahin hai, ye raashtra bhaavana ko jagaane vaale hai
 If you do not want to salute your motherland, whom do you want to salute? What is your insult in saluting Bharat Mata? Those who do not want to salute Bharat Mata should go to Pakistan or Bangladesh

 He asked his party workers to put up the board of Vande Mataram across Maharashtra
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke fatve hindu or muslamaanon ke bich tanaav ko badhaate hai

 (4 + 6 = 10) (3) Sachin scored the ball out of the boundary for 28 times with 25 fours and 3 sixes during his double century
 yahaan bhi aata he vahi nateeja, 2+8=10
 (4) With the help of only fours and sixes, he scored 118 runs
 ek baar phir 1+1+8=10
 (5) Sachin collected 82 runs in his innings
 yahaan bhi 8+2=10
 (6) Sachin scored a double century in odis in the year 2010
 yahaan bhi 10 sachin ke liye bhaagyashaalee sabit hua
 Watch the video, Sachin (7) is truly the 'god' of cricket, with a total of 649 runs scored by both teams in the match
 bharat ne banaae 401 ran, jabaki dakshin africa ne banaae 248 ran
 Once again the result is 10, 6 + 4 + 9 = 19
 phir inhen joden 1+9=10
 (8) At the time when India won this match, the visiting team needed 154 more runs to win
 yani, 1+5+4=10
 (9) Sachin Tendulkar is currently in his 37th year of age
 aankade ek baar phir 10 kii ore hi ishaara karte hai, 3+7=10
 (10) On playing the match-winning innings, Sachin got a check of Rs 10 lakh from the Gwalior District Cricket Association
 kuch anya tathy bhi is ore ishaara karte hai ki sachin kaa 10 se gaharaa judaav he
 (1) Sachin always wears a number 10 jersey from Team India
 (2) sachin ne vanade main 10,000waan ran australia ke khilaaf 31 march, 2001 ko banaaya tha
 Adding all the digits of this date, 3 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 10
 (3) sachin kaa naam es akshar se shuru hota he, jo ki angreji varnmaala kaa 19waan akshar he
 The result, 1 + 9 = 10
 (4) sachin ne 1996 ke worldcup main kul 523 ran banaae the
 Its sum, 5 + 2 + 3 = 10

 dilli sarkaar ke saath pichley dinon jo kuch hua,yaa ise yun bhi kah len ki usne jo kuch kiya,usase kai mahatvapurn sawaal man main uthte hai
 The first question is that the government of the country's capital was on strike for about 10 days
 sarkaar ke khilaaf hadataalon kii baat to aam thi,lekin yah ekadam se khaas ho gai
 And that strike also against whom - against his own Lieutenant Governor, and that too by entering his office
 duusari mazedaar or bahut chintit kar dene vaali baat yah he ki sarkaar apane hilliashafasaron par aarope laga rahi thi ki ve hadtaal par hai
 i had heard the news of the protest of the officers on the insolence of any minister of the government, but it was heard for the first time that the IAS Jamaat of Delhi should go on strike against the entire government
 isse bhi zyaada chaunkaane vaali teesri baat yah he kishiashfasar kah rahe the ki ham to hadtaal par hai hi nahin
 We are coming to office every day
 to phir sach bol koun rahaa tha
 
 
 The Or both were true, and both had their own truths
 
 
 ?aam logon kii drushti main donon kaa ohada bada he
 The public expects the truth from both of them, and if they start doubting the truth of both of them, then what is the condition of the system is beyond description
 shaayad araajaktaavaad kaa janm yaheen se hota he
 And even more interesting than these three incidents is that the Government of Delhi is going on strike and pressurizing its lieutenant governor to break the strike of the IAS officers
 yah to gazab hi ho gaya
 Are the governments of the states of India really so lazy, obnoxious and deprived of authority that they cannot control their officials
 
 
 ?yadi sachmuch aisa he,to desh ko apane sanghatmak swaroop ke bare main hi nahin,loktantric charitra ke bare main bhi sochna padegaa
 Then it became an officer system
 in sabhi ghatnaon ke peeche kii raajnneeti chaahe jo bhi ho,lekin dimag kii sui is tathy par pahunchakar atak jaati he ki yah sab,aisa sab dilli kii sarkaar ke saath hi kyon hota he
 Other states also have governments of opposing parties at the center
 donon ke bich'hot taak'bhi hote rahete hai,tanatani bani rahati he
 But there they are not the 'so-called tamasha', which happens in Delhi
 kya aisa isliye hota he,kyonki dilli main hua chota-sa tamaasha bhi desh kaa tamaasha ban jaataa he
 
 
 The Certainly the constitutional position of the state of Delhi is weaker than that of other states, and can be held fundamentally responsible for the current crisis and problems
 in sanvaidhanik prakriyaaon ke prati dilli kii sattashin party kii pratikriya kabhi-kabhi itani tikhi or aakraamak ho jaati he ki vah vipaksh kii party lagane lagati he,lekin jab ham samvidhan ke vyaavhaarik paksh par aate hai,to hamen loktantr ko usase upar uthakar'paraspar samaj'evam'prashasnic aavashyaktaaon'kii drushti se bhi dekhnaa hota he
 This may be due to the immaturity of experience or the rapture of young blood, but their political and administrative functioning do not realize the moisture of cohesion that is so essential to work from humanitarian institutions
 isaki antim parinti takaraav main hoti he,chautarafa takaraav main;jo vartmaan main dilli sarkaar ke saath dikhaai de rahi he
 Otherwise any space of union can be determined, and this is also the art of politics and administration

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Wednesday that if India were to win their fifth crucial one-day match against Australia today, the top-order batsmen would have to perform well together instead of relying on the lower order
 acchhee shuruyaat ke baad hi banegaa bada scorabhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘‘shisharkram ko acchhee ballebaaji kerani hogi or nichle kram par nirbharta se bachanaa hoga
 If you are playing with 7 batsmen, then a score greater than six is expected
 lakshya kaa peechha karte samay saatven ballebaaj par chhodana thik nahin he jo byaap ballebaaj hota he
 "he said in the press conference before the match," If a top batsman makes a big score then it will be easy for us
 yadi hamen acchhee shuruyaat milti he to bada score jarur banegaa jisase ham dabaav bana sakenge
 Dhoni Nedhoni took the batsmen in the face of the attack, taking his batsmen to the point of not being able to achieve an easy target of 250 runs in the Mohali ODI
 australia ne yah match jitkar shrinkhalaa main 2-2 se barabari kar lee
 He said, "ravinder Jadeja is in the team as a bowling all-rounder
" vah acchhee gendbaaji kar rahaa he or uski ballebaaji bhi mahatvapurn he
 "he said batting at number seven does not mean scoring half-centuries or big scores, but scoring fast
" yadi ham lakshya kaa peechha kar rahe hai or wicket ganvaa dete hai to har ballebaaj ko atirikt prayaas karne honge
 "sachin should not be brought under pressure
 Sachin Tendulkar has failed to score big in the series so far but Dhoni said that this star batsman should not be put under pressure only seven runs away from 17 thousand ODI runs 
" dhoni ne kaha 'jab bhi sachin maidan par utarate hai to unase kaaphi apekshaayen kii jaati hai or un par bahut jimmedaari hoti he
 He has been doing this for the last 20 years
 jab bhi vah krij par utarate hai ham unase bade score kii aashaa karte hai lekin iske saath hi ham nahin chaahate ki vah dabaav main ballebaaji karen
 'now that there are only three matches, the series being equaled 2-2, Dhoni said that this match is important in terms of the result of the series
 unhone kaha 'jab yah 1-1 se baraabar thi to maine kaha tha ki yah paanch maichon kii shrinkhalaa ke jaise he
 Now we can see it like a three-match series
 ab prayek match mahatvapurn he
 Now the important thing is that no day should be wasted
 ab jabaki maichon kii sankhya kam rah gayi he to vaapasi ke liye bhi samay nahin he
 Now each match and every hour is important for both teams
 ' ballebaaj gautam gambhir ke puri tarah feet ho jane se bhartiya team ko raahat mili he lekin tej gendbaaj ashish nehra ko khaansee he haalanki dhoni ne ise gambhir nahin bataaya
 Dhoni said that even though Australian coach Tim Nielsen complained about the hectic schedule, the players had ample time to rest
 unhone kaha, 'yadi dilli or mohali ke maichon ke bich kaa samay chhod diya jaae to prayek match ke bich do din kaa antar he
 This is enough to overcome fatigue

 Senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse on Wednesday indirectly targeted former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for not performing as expected by the party in the Maharashtra Assembly elections and some party leaders for the defeat of his daughter Rohini and former minister Pankaja Munde
 Accused of
 khadse ne vidhansabha chunaav main party kii 105 siten aane ke liye jimmedaar netaaon ke khilaaf karrwai kii maang kii jo ki 2014 kii 122 siton se kam he
 He indirectly targeted another chief minister, Fadnavis, saying that the BJP would have retained power if the party had acceded to the chief minister's post in the new government of its former ally Shiv Sena
 samvaadadaataaon ne jab yah poocha ki kya vah fadanvis par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai to khadse ne kaha, ‘main us vyakti ke bare main baat kar rahaa hum jisane puure chunavi prachaar or ranneeti kaa netritv kiya
 i do not need to name anyone at this time because people are smart enough
 ' bhaajapa ne is varsh oktober main hue vidhansabha chunaav main khadse ko tikat dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 However, the party had given her daughter a ticket from her home town Muktainagar in Jalgaon district
 lekin rohinee khadse shivasena ke baagi chandrakant patil se chunaav haar gayi
 At the same time, Munde lost to his cousin and NCP candidate Dhananjay Munde in Parli seat in Beed district
 khadse ne kaha, ‘meraa or pankaja kaa yah vichaar he ki bhaajapa ke kuch netaaon ne unhen or rohinee ko haraane kaa prayaas kiya
 i have informed the state BJP unit chief Chandrakant Patil about this
 ' khadse ko 2016 main bhoomi hathiyaane ke aaropon ko lekar tatkaaleen bhaajapa sarkaar se rajasav mantri pad se istipha dene ke liye baadhya kiya gaya tha
 Pankaja, the daughter of late BJP veteran Gopinath Munde, on Monday removed the word 'BJP' from her Twitter introduction after her defeat in the election
 iske baad unke agle raajnneetik kadam ko lekar atakalein lagaayi jane lagi thim
 But she said on Tuesday that the defection is not in her blood and she will not leave the BJP
 khadse ne kaha, ‘yadi chandrashekhar baavankule, vinod taavade, prakaash mehta or mujhe chunaav maidan se dur nahin rakhaa gaya hota or adhik sakriy tarah se shaamil kiya gaya hota to parinaam bhaajapa ke vartmaan siton kii sankhya se behatar hote
 Attacking Fadnavis indirectly, he said that no one can take a selective stand to take credit for bjp's victory and avoid responsibility for defeat
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa ke ummid ke anuroop pradarshan nahin karne ko lekar jo jimmedaar hai, unhen javabdeh tehraaya janaa chahie or unhen karrwai kaa saamana karnaa chahie
 Without naming Fadnavis, he said, 'I am talking about the person who took decisions before the October 21 election which resulted in the BJP losing more seats
 ' khadse ne shivasena kii baari baari se mukhyamantri hone kii maang ko bhaajapa dwaara sweekaar nahin karne ke nirnay kaa bhi ullekh kiya jiske parinamswaroop uddhav thakare nit party ne gathbandhan sarkaar banane ke liye rakanpa or congress ke saath haath milaayaa
 He said, 'if we had taken a few steps back and had a proper dialogue with the Shiv Sena, the saffron alliance would have retained the government because the mandate was for bjp-shiv Sena rule
 ' khadse ne fadanvis ke najdiki sahyogi evam purv mantri girish mahajan par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa jo jalgaanv se aate hai
 Mahajan was given the responsibility of campaigning in North Maharashtra where the BJP performed poorly

 lambii charchaa or bahes-mubahise ke baad antim viceroy lord mountbeton is nishkarsh par pahunche the
 Now it was the turn to make its formal announcement

 In addition to Indian journalists in the hall, journalists from America, Russia and China were listening intently to Lord Mountbatten

 What is the date of independence

 'indeed, a glorious memory of Mountbatten was associated with this date
 isi din burma ke jangalon main lambey samay se chali aa rahi ladaai kaa ant hua tha or japani samrajya ne bina kisi shart ke aatmasamarpan kiya tha
 What else could have been a better date for Mountbatten than the second anniversary of Japan's surrender to the birth of a new democratic Asia

 About three months ago North Korea makes hydrogen bombs
 puri duniya kii nazren tedi ho jaati hai
 Then three months later, the same North Korean freak dictator Kim Jong, who is armed with a hydrogen bomb, now releases a video all over the world
 america par parmaanu hamale kaa video
 Along with this video, he is also giving the biggest threat to America that America should decide whether America will remain in the world? South Korea's friendship with the world's most powerful country i
e
 America, its neighbor North Korea dictator Kim Jong He went so desperately that he directly threatened America against it
 agar ye dhamkee or kuch roj pehle di gai hoti, to shaayad duniya ise halke main bhi le leti lekin isi saal 6 janvari ko uttar korea ne jis tarah se hidrosem bam kaa pareekshan kar puri duniya ko chaunkaa diya, uske baad ab kim jong un kii is dhamkee ke myne hi badal gaye hai
 Anyway, the world is already aware of Kim Jong-un's way of shooting his enemies, talking to wild dogs and crocodiles
 aise main agar vaaki ye taanashaah apni dhamkee par amal karata he to iskaa kya anjaam hoga iskaa andaja shaayad khud kim jong un ko bhi nahin hoga
 In recent times hardly any such open threat has been given to America, the world's most powerful country
 magar yahaan uttar korea kaa sanakee taanashaah na sirf america ko dhamka rahaa he balki is anemated video ko jari kar america kii rajdhani washington disi par parmaanu hamalaa kar uskaa namonishaan mitaa dene kii tasviren bhi jari kar rahaa he
 The video shows that a nuclear bomb is released from North Korea and that it falls directly on Washington
 iske baad puraa washington aag ke gole main tabdeel ho jaataa he
 During the nuclear attack, the White House, the official home of the US President, has been shown to be engulfed in flames
 ye video asli nahin, anemated he magar ye is baat kaa saboot he ki kim jong un america se kitni nafrat karata he
 And that's why he himself has released this video in front of the world
 vowashington disi par parmaanu bam barasakaruskaa namonishaan mitaa dena chahta he
 He has threatened that if the US does not desist from provoking North Korea, then it will not be afraid to show even a nuclear bomb
 america ko dhamkaane kii badi vajahadrasal ye video jari kar uttar korea, america ko isliye dhamka rahaa he kyonki haal hi main america ne dakshin korea ke saath saajha sainya abhyaas kiya tha
 North Korea is very upset with this
 iske alaava missile or rocket pareekshan ke baad haal hi main hydrogen bam ke safal pareekshan ko lekar sanyukt raashtra sangh ne uske khilaaf jo pratibandh lagaae hai, usase bhi jong un baukhalaayaa hua he
 He feels that all this has happened at the behest of America
 halake main nahin lee ja sakati dhamkikya uttar korea sirf apane dam par america ko tabah kar saktaa he? america par parmaanu hamale karne ke uttar korea kii dhamkiyon main vaaki koi dam he? jaankaron kii maane to uttar korea ke paas das hajaar kilometre kii duuri tak hamalaa karne vaale missile bhi maujuud hai or parmaanu bam bhi
 America's distance from North Korea is more than 10 thousand kilometers i
e
 North Korea's missiles can reach America easily
 aise main uski dhamkiyon ko halake main nahin liya ja saktaa
 North Korea's powerful weapons include the Tapodong, Musudan and Nodong missiles, which currently have missiles in the North Korean fleet
 in sabhi mixilon kii maarak kshamta alag-alag he, lekin jaankaron kii maane to tapodong-2 das hajaar kilometre dur tak kisi bhi torget ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 In such a situation, if North Korea uses it for a nuclear attack, then it can sit and attack North America to the western end
 ab uski yahi takat duniya ke liye sir dard ban chuki he
 a major problem in the case of North Korea is that most of the countries of the world may have left it in isolation and banned it, but China still stands with it
 china se uttar korea kaa purana yaarana rahaa he
 Whenever it comes to dealing with it strictly, China retreats
 aise main uttar korea ke gale main ghanti koun baandhe, ye ek bada sawaal he
 The biggest danger is the worry of having the world's most powerful and most dangerous bomb in the hands of an eccentric dictator
 or wo bhi ek aisa bam, jo kisi bhi bade shahar kaa namonishaan bas minuton main mitaa de
 Recently, on the birthday of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, his scientists gave him such a dangerous hydrogen bomb gift
 puri duniya se alag-thalag is mulk ke sciencedaanon ne ek batan dabaaya or udhar rajdhani pyongang se saikadon mile dur pungye-ri newclear centre ke kareeb jameen ke kaaphi andar ek jabardast dhamaakaa hota he
 The explosion was so powerful that the whole earth was shaken
 uttar korea main 5
 An earthquake of 1 magnitude occurred
 jaahir he ye bukamp dhamaake kii dein thi, lihaaja bukamp ke fouran baad hi padosi desh dakshin korea or japan kii taraf se ye daawa kar diya gaya ye bukamp prakritik nahi hai balki ye uttar korea ke sanakee taanashaah kii sanak kaa nateeja he
 South Korea and Japan made this accusation and soon thereafter North Korea sealed the test of the world's most dangerous hydrogen bomb
 uttar korea ke tamaam tivi channelon par iskaa elaan kar diya gaya
 Neighboring countries are angry with the hydrogen test, although countries like China, Japan, South Korea are extremely angry after this test
 japan or dakshin korea jaise mulkon ke saath-saath sanyukt raashtra sangh ne bhi pareekshan ke baad apatkaaleen baithak bulaakar maahaul kaa nae sire se jayja lene kii shuruyaat kar di he
 At the same time, according to the American Geological Survey, immediately after the explosion, Jaljala, which came about 50 km away in the northwest part of Kilju city, is the result of this blast
 survey kii maane to ab tak kii chaanbin main jo subut mili hai, wo ishaara karte hai ki dhamaake ke baad aayaa jaljla kudarti nahin tha
 It made headlines in April last year before the merciless dictator's hydrogen bomb test when it blew its own Defense Minister with a cannon just because he had fallen asleep during a meeting
 isane apane hi foofa ko nanga kar sau bhukhe kutton ke aage isliye phenk diya tha kyonki wo isaki kursi ke liye khatra ban gaya tha
 In this country, if a foreign TV channel, foreign films or foreign songs are heard, it hangs it and sets its house on fire
 iske mulk main aam log car se nahin chal sakate
 This right belongs only to the ministers and officers of the Ministry of Defense
 iske mulk main iske baalo kaa style hi sabake baalo kaa fishan mana jaataa he
 Ghatkim Jong is the heartless dictator who can go to any extent
 kehete hai wo ab tak hajaaron logon ko maut ke ghat utarava chukaa he
 The people of his country are forced to suffer because Kim does not tolerate rebellion
 vah virodh kii aawaaj ko sakhti se dabaa detaa he
 The dictator himself determines the future of the people of North Korea
 dakshin korea or america ke saath lagaataar tanaav ke chalate yahaan hameshaa yuddh jaise halaat bane rahete hai
 Therefore, to increase its military strength, this dictator orders people from every household to forcefully join the army
 itnaa hi nahin, sena kii takat badhaane ke liye ladakiyon ko bhi jabardastee sainik banaata he
 North Korea has been facing the brunt of this dictator, but now it is also giving a shout to the rest of the world
 kabhi japan ko to kabhi america ko parmaanu hamale kii chetavanee detaa rahata he or ab to ye hydrogen bam se bhi las he
 Obviously, if it is not stopped soon, it can become a threat to the whole world

 kuch chaatro ne raashtrapati ke daure ke dauraan kaale jhande dikhaane kii baat kahi he
 In view of this, the police has prepared a two-tier security layer

 AMU chaatr sangh ke upaadhyaksh sajaad subhaan ne kaha, 'yadi vah maafee nahin maangate hai to unhen uniwarsity main nahin aana chahie
 Either accept the mistake for your statement of the year 2010 or stay away from the convocation
 ' yahi nahin, subhaan ne to raashtrapati ke kaarykram ke dauraan virodh karne kii dhamkee bhi thi
 He said that the students are angry that a person who has made controversial remarks about the Muslim community is coming to the convocation
 sajaad ne kaha, 'raashtrapati ko pehle yah sweekaar karnaa chahie ki bharat yahaan rahane vaale sabhi dharm ke logon kaa he, nahin to parisar main unka swaagat nahin kiya jayega
 He said that there was no need to call the President for the convocation
 unke aane se santhaan ko koi phayda nahin hoga
 He said that the Vice Chancellor has invited the President to pursue his interests
 vah yah sandesh dena chaahate hai ki AMU ne bijepi sarkaar or uski vichaardhaara ko apana liya he

 It is worth noting that in recent times, there is a dispute between the BJP and the Congress about grabbing the legacy of Sardar Patel
 modi ne haal ke dinon main apane bhaashanon main patel kii saraahna or nehru kii paroksh rup se aalochana kii he
 In the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday, Modi had said that if Patel was the first Prime Minister of the country instead of Nehru, the country would be in a better position
 iskaa jawaab dete hue manmohan singh ne isi manch se kaha tha ki sardaar patel 'secular congressi' the or nehru kaa bada sammaan karte the
 'modi wishing to learn from Patel in dealing with the riots' The Congress accused the BJP of trying to capture the legacy of Sardar Patel and the BJP encouraged the Congress to promote the nehru-gandhi family
 soochna-prasaaran mantri manish tiwari ne twitor ke jariye poocha tha ki kya modi sangh par pratibandh lagane ke patel ke faisle se sahamat hai? yah bayaanbaji or aage bad gai jab maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantri shashi tharur ne ek nijee channel se baatcheet main kaha ki kaash modi sikh pate ki patel ne 1947 ke dangon ko kaise handle kiya

 But during the communal violence of 1947, Patel brought thousands of Muslims to the Red Fort
 kya 2002 main modi ke shashan main bhi yah hua ? modi ne gandhiji or patel ko istemaal karne kii koshish kii
 Patel had many differences with Nehru, but everyone knew about him
 'modi ne blog par likhaais bich 'stachu of unity' kii neenv rakhe jane se pehle modi ne apane blog par likhaa, 'is saal sardaar patel kii jayanti zyada khaas hogi kyonki ham stachu of unity kii neenv rakhane ja rahe hai

 ' The Kedarnath temple, which has suffered tremendous devastation from floods and rains, is now in greater danger than ghee
 yah ghi hajaaron bhakton kii ore se yahaan chadhaaya or deevaaron par mala jaataa he
 a team of ASI scientists has discovered that a one and a half inch thick layer of ghee has climbed the temple walls
 isse vahaan keede lag gaye hai
 Stones cannot breathe in their natural way with this layer of ghee
 pattharon main nami aa jaati he jisase samay se pehle hi unka ksharan hone laga he
 The same ASI team has been tasked to renovate the Kedarnath temple
 is chaar sadasyeey team ne 12 oktober ko kedarnath mandir kii safai kaa kaam shuru kiya lekin ve sirf do hafte hi kaam kar paae or mandir ke kapaat sardiyon kii vajah se band ho gaye
 The stone Kedarnath temple is turning into a chure from the layer of ghee, situated in the Mandakini valley of Garhwal at 3,500 meters above sea level
 shivlinga kaa darshan karne vaale shraddhalu apane saath ghi lekar aate hai or apane haathon se us par malate hai
 After that they rub her hands on the walls there to clean her hands
 saikadon varshon se yah pratha chali aa rahi he
 The scientific team of ASI found that this layer of ghee destroyed many artifacts on the walls of the temple
 ghi kii rasinic pratikriya se pathar kaa upree hissaa chure main badalata ja rahaa he
 GHASI Director KS Rana told that we had not been brought up by any such problem as it was in Kedarnath
 thand ke kaaran ghi vahaan jam jaataa he jise hamen blor se garm karke hataanaa padaa
 After this we did chemical treatment there and then had to remove moisture from the walls by rubbing multani soil
 15 may ke baad shuru hoga jirnoddhar kaa aglaa charaneesai mandir kii deevaaron se 13 se 15 pratishat tak ghi hi hataa paaya he
 Only two buckets of ghee came out of the monolithic field
 abhi vahaan bahut kaam baaki he or ab agle charan kaa kaam 15 may ke baad hi ho sakegaa jab mandir ke kapaat khulenge
 The team hopes that due to high temperatures in those days, the work of removing ghee will speed up
 eesai iske alaava jali hui agarbattiyon or unki raakh ko bhi hataane kaa kaam karegaa
 The Kedarnath temple is looked after by the Badrinath Kedarnath Temple Committee of the state government

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting Israel
 guuruuvaar ko ve isroyal ke shahar hypha gaye
 While he paid tribute to the Indian soldiers who were martyred in the first world war, Modi was accompanied by the Israeli Prime Minister
 ye shahar isroyal ko hindustan kii bahaduree or balidaan se jodta he
 99 years ago, in World War I, the valiant warriors of India liberated Haifa from the Turks
 unke sammaan main dilli main teen murti chowk bhi banaaya gaya he
 There is talk of changing its name to Teen Murti Haifa Chowk
 jaane hypha shahar ke bare menhypha isroyal main samudr ke kinare basaa ek chota sa shahar he
 But this time the city has become the biggest link connecting the two strong democracies of the world
 99 saal puraane yuddh main hindustani veerta ne inhen or majbootee se joda he
 This battle took place on 23 September 1918
 aaj bhi is din koijroyal main hypha divasake rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Learn the complete history of the Haifa War: At the time of World War, the soldiers of 3 princely states of Mysore, Jodhpur and Hyderabad were sent to Turkey for war on behalf of the British
 hyderabad riyasat ke sainik muslim the, isliye angrejon ne unhen turki ke khalipha ke viruddh yuddh main hissaa lene se roak diya
 Only the Ranbankurs of Jodhpur and Mysore were ordered to fight the war
 hypha par kabje ke liye ek taraf turkon or germany kii sena thi to duusari taraf angrejon kii taraf se hindustan kii teen riyasaton kii fouj
 Why the victory was special This victory was even more special because the Indian soldiers had only horse riding, lances (a type of spear) and sword weapons
 vahiin turki sainikon ke paas barood or mashinagan thi
 Nevertheless, Indian soldiers beat him to dust
 bas talwaar or bhaale-barche ke saath hi bhartiya sainikon ne unhen haraa diya
 It was headed by Major Dalpat Singh Shekhawat
 ye bhi padhe-bhartiya samudaay ke bich piem modi ne ginai uplabdhiyaan, yaad kiye isroyal se sadiyon puraane rishtekul 1,350 german or turk kaidiyon par bhartiya sainikon ne kabja kar liya tha
 It also included two German officers, 35 Ottoman officers, 17 artillery guns and 11 machine guns
 is dauraan, aath log maare gaye or 34 ghayal hue, jabaki 60 ghode maare gaye or 83 anya ghayal hue
 Please tell that in Haifa Indian cemetery there are graves of 49 soldiers killed in the First World War
 bataa den ki 23 sitambar 1918 kii ye jang ghudsawaari kii sabase badi or aakhri jang thi,jisane isroyal banane kaa rasta kholaa
 This Haifa became a Jewish identity in 1918
 14 may 1948 ko isroyal banane ke baad is nae desh main yahudiyon ke liye rasta khul gaya
 When Israel started a war with Arab countries in 1948, it was once again the center of the Haifa war
 mukhyamantri harish ravat ne pehle to aanan-fanan main yah elaan kar daalaa ki uttarakhand 21 june ko manaae ja rahe antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke jashn kaa aadhikarik taur par hissaa nahin hoga
 He then took a U-turn after being criticized
 uttarakhand sarkaar kii ore se press relies jari kar bataaya gaya ki rajya memyog diwas par kaarykramyojit kiye jaaenge
 It states that on June 21, on the occasion of World Yoga Day, a state-level workshop will be organized at the Pavilion Ground in Dehradun
 is kaaryshaala main mukhyamantri harish ravat mukhya atithi honge
 a review meeting was held at the Secretariat on Thursday regarding preparations for Yoga Day
 baithak main bataaya gaya ki 21 june ko pavilion ground memyog divasake avasar par kaaryshaala kaa ayojan kiya jayega
 The workshop will be inaugurated by Chief Minister Harish Rawat and Medical Health Minister Surendra Singh Negi
 itnaa hi nahin, pramukh sachiv dwaara adhikariyon ko nirdesh die gaye ki mukhyamantri dwaara is baat par jor diya gaya he ki yoga ko pradesh kii aarthiki se joda jaae
 For this a concrete policy should be prepared, which should be announced on 21 June
 rajyastareey kaaryshaala main yogaguru, schuli chaatr-chatraayen bhi shaamil rahenge
 CM had previously done yoga, before Harish Rawat told reporters in Dehradun on Wednesday, "we will not be part of the International Yoga Day celebration, because we are not interested in beating the drum
" ’ haalanki, mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki uttarakhand shaareerik or maansik dekhbhaal kii pracheen bhartiya paddati ko protsaahan dene ke paksh main he or iske liye uski apni yojana he
 Rawat had said, 'however, we are not interested in beating the drum about this
 ham sitambar se yoga ko protsaahan dene ke liye jald hi vistrut kaary yojana ke saath aaenge
 ' punjab chunaav kii sugabugahat shuru hote hi raajnneetik halkon main sabase bada sawaal yahi uchhla ki bijepi se istipha dekar uske rajyasabha saansad or purv cricketer navjot singh siddhu apni agali raajnneetik pari kis party ke saath shuru karenge
 First, he started speculating about going to the Aam Aadmi Party, then he was seen forming his own team and now he has finally joined the Congress
 siddhu ke congress main aane se party ko kya phayda hoga or party main chunaav ke baad unki kya bhoomika hogi isapar to raajnneeti ke dhurandhar bhi koi baat daawey ke saath nahin kah sakate lekin itnaa tay he ki agle 15 din tak siddhu ke jariye congress punjab main khabaron main chai rahane vaali he
 -first wife Navjot Kaur and then Sidhu himself joined the Congress, there is a clear message among the voters in Punjab that if anyone is the strongest candidate for victory in these elections, then it is the Congress
 jaahir he party ko isse virodhiyon par manovaigyanik badhat banane kaa mauka mila he
 The joint press conference of Captain and Sidhu, Amarinder said that the unconditional Congress-led sidhu-aam Aadmi Party and its convenor Arvind Kejriwal are attackers on the Badal family and are trying to convey this message to the voters by claiming that they will be sent to jail if they win the election
 It is that Badal can get the same salvation from the government's misrule, Congress and Amarinder themselves were lagging behind the leaders in this matter, but Navjot Inh Sidhu has a shortfall came home
 apni pehali hi pressvarta main unhone jis tarah 'bhaag badal bhaag' kaha wo unke iraade or tevar jaahir karne ke liye kaaphi he
 The kind of coverage that Arvind Kejriwal gets in the national media was not possible for Amarinder and the Congress to fight against, but Navjot Singh Sidhu is no less than Kejriwal in terms of media headlines
 aise main is front par wo congress ko aap ke mukaable majboot kar sakate hai
 In Punjab, the biggest drawback for the Aam Aadmi Party is not to be its CM candidate
 amarinder or badal jaise kaddavar netaaon ke mukaable jab voter aam aadmi party kii ore dekhtaa he to use kejariwal kaa hi cheharaa dikhaai detaa he
 Recently, Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia had appealed to vote in Kejriwal's name in view of the same situation but it had the opposite effect and the next day Kejriwal himself had to deny it
 -aam aadmi party ne badal sarkaar ke khilaaf takkar main khud ko sabit karne ke liye hi mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ke khilaaf lambi se dilli ke apane vidhayak jaranel singh ko maidan main utaara
 But to make this bet of AAP, Amarinder also announced to fight Lambi
 amarinder bhale hi is seat par jeet na paaen lekin badal ke virdohi voton ko baantkar wo jaranel ko bhi jeetne nahin denge
 Sidhu filed nomination from Amritsar East seat - Navjot Singh Sidhu's entry in Congress has caused the biggest loss to Shiromani Akali dal-bjp alliance
 aam aadmi party pehle se hi uske khilaaf hamalavar thi or ab siddhu kaa khulkar sarkaar or badal parivaar ke khilaaf hallaa bol rahi sahi kasar bhi puri kar degaa
 This alliance is already facing anti-incumbency of the last 10 years
 saare survey bhi gathbandhan ko tisare sthaan par dhakel rahe hai
 In such a situation it has become difficult for him
 duusari ore amarinder kaa aatmavishvaas or bad gaya he
 The proof of this is his claim of two-thirds majority in Amritsar today instead of victory
 -navjot singh siddhu kii chunauti ko sattarudh gathbandhan ab tak yahi kahkar khaarij kar rahaa he ki unhen koi gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 If we look at Sidhu's previous political career, it can also be said that it will be difficult for Amarinder to 'control' Sidhu after victory
 mana ja rahaa he ki khud amarinder bhi ye baat samajhate hai or siddhu kii party main entry unki hari jhandi na milane ke chalate hi ataki rahi lekin is baat se virdohi bhi inkaar nahin kar rahe ki siddhu main bheed ko khinchne or apni baton se use prabhavit karne kii jabardast kshamta he or iskaa puraa phayda congress ko hi milane vaala he

 modern youth sabakuch jaldi or behatar sthiti main chaahate hai
 Therefore, he wants to start his job well and take his retirement at the age of 45-50 instead of 60 years
 itani jaldi ritairement lekar vah apni marji se kuch karnaa chaahate hai or apni puunji kaa behatar istemaal karnaa chaahate hai
 However, this scheme can be completed only when they have a huge amount to spend
 lihaaja ritairement ke liye paisa jodna ahm he or apane bachat ko kargar nivesh ke jariye moti rakam main badal sakate hai
 If you want to add big money to the retirement, then you should start saving money by setting your risk appetite and investment goals
 yadi aapako ritair hone ke pehle 1 karod yaa 2 karod rupee jamaa karne hai to yah tarika aapke sapane ko puraa kar saktaa he
 Take advantage of compounding by starting investment early
 If you save Rs 100 annually and get 10% interest annually, then at the end of the year you will have Rs 110
 compound interest kii takat ke chalate aapako agle saal 110 rupee kaa 10 fisadi byaaj milegaa jo badhkar 121 rupee ho jayega
 After this, you will get 10% interest over Rs 121 and this cycle will continue
 is tarah aapaki bachat dhire dhire badhati chali jaati he
 Compounding 7
 2 saal main aapke 10 lakh ko karegaa 20 lakhto agar aap 10 fisadi salanaa compounding byaaj ke saath nivesh karte hai to niyam 72 kii vajah se aapaki bachat 7
 Will double in 2 years
 isi tarah agar aap badi rakam ko len jaise 10 lakh rupee to 7
 In 2 years, it will increase to 20 lakh rupees
 yaad rakhen ki aapako lagaataar nivesh karnaa he
 Only then your amount will increase
 jaise ki agar aapako60 saal kii umr main ritairhona he to aapaki nivesh kii hui rakam kaa kareeb 6 guna ho janaa chahie
 This is called the strength of compounding
 lambii avadhi ke liye nivesh kiya hua paisa zyada gati se badhata he
 So if you start investing early, due to the power of compounding, your invested money can increase by double, triple or four times
 bachat ke saath-saath nivesh ko den ahmiyatpaise bachaane se zyada mahatvapurn paise nivesh karnaa bhi he
 Your money will increase with investment and you will be able to face inflation too
 bharat main paise bachaane kii dar vishwa ke anya deshon ke mukaable zyada he or iskaa sahi upyog hona chahie
 Most of the housewives save money but do not invest it, so inflation ends this money and you do not increase it
 isliye agar aapke paas ghar main yaa bank khate yaa phicsad diposit main paisa padaa he to ise mahangaai ke hamale se bachaane or isaki vailu kam hone se bachaane ke liye nivesh karen
 Build your portfolio according to the goal: Set goals at the beginning of your investment and keep checking it from time to time
 isse aapako pataa chalata rahegaa ki aap apane lakshya ke kitne kareeb hai
 In this way, following the rules of investment, you can easily add a large amount before retirement
 iske saath hi iske liye jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki aap kisi ek aeset class main nivesh se bachein or apana paisa mutual fund, gold, real estate, pipief, bank phicsad diposit or derevative or opshan main baant kar lagaaein
 By keeping your money in different asset classes, you can use it whenever you need money for an emergency
