 priyanka gandhi kaa jaadu congress ke alaava ab sahyogi dalon ke bhi sir chadhakar bol rahaa he
 In Bihar, JDU is eyeing Uttar Pradesh with the Congress, but now JDU, which is aware of its party status in the state, is ready to stand behind the Congress, so that the BJP can be stopped and for this, it Has also placed a bet on Priyanka Gandhi ab jediu bhi prashanth kishor kii raah par chalate hue congress ko salaah de rahi he ki upi main ek bade chehre kii darkaar he or vopriyanka gandhiho sakati hai
 JDU general secretary and spokesperson KC Tyagi said in conversation till today that, if Priyanka becomes CM candidate, the public will elect only Congress and her colleagues like us
 tyaagi ne yah bhi kaha ki, agar priyanka siem ummivaar nahin bananaa chaahatin to kam se kam amethi or raibareli tak simit na rahen
 Priyanka should campaign all over the state
 nitish or priyanka kaa aakarshan rahegaa hitjediu kaa maananaa he ki, nitish kii saaf suthri chhavi or priyanka kaa janata ke bich aakarshan chunaav main hit rahegaa, donon kii saajha reliyaan upi main hamaare gathjod ko janata ke bich lokapriy banaaengi, jiskaa phayda congress ko hi hoga kyonki, hamako upi main apni takat kaa ehsaas he or ham chote bhai kii bhoomika main hi rahanaa chaahate hai
 However, so far no proposal has been officially given to Congress by JDU
 lekingediuka kahana he ki, prashanth kishor pehle hi congress ko ye prastaav de chuke hai or is par aakhri faisla congress or gandhi parivaar ko hi karnaa he
 JDU believes it is necessary to stop BJP in UP
 Actually, JDU also believes on the lines of Prashant Kishore that if the Congress is not stopped by BJP in QP, then the path of 2019 will be difficult
 isliye priyanka ko siem na sahi kam se kam bataur star prachaarak maidan main utaar dena chahie
 The anti-bjp grand alliance will not be formed in UP: JDU and Congress have not yet formally signed a deal in UP
 rashtriya lok dal ke mukhiya ajit singh kabhi jediu to kabhi bijepi se baat kar rahe hai
 The SP and the BSP are not compromising with anyone, in such a situation that the grand alliance of BJP opposition on the lines of Bihar would not have happened in UP, now JDU may be looking at Priyanka Gandhi as the only trump
 aakhir 2019 main piem kii kursi par nitish kii nigahen bhi to hai
 But the final decision on Priyanka will be taken by the Gandhi family, for which JDU will also be waiting along with Prashant Kishore and Congress workers

 Jaswant Singh, MLA of Shujalpur Assembly in Shajapur district had gone to Hada to listen to the farmers' problems but he biffed at a farmer
 jaswant singh haada us sarkaar ke vidhayak or purv mantri hai jo khud ko kisaanon kaa hamdard bataati he
 But in the video, MLA Jaswant Singh Hada is threatening farmers instead of listening to them
 ye maamla kisaan sandesh yatra kaa he, jab kisaanon kii samasya sunne ke liye vidhayak ji ne camp lagaaya
 When the farmer of village Mangalaj narrated his problem, Vidhiyak ji got angry and started telling Kharkhoti
 unhone saaf shabdon main kisaan ko kaha ki koi bhi samasya ho to mere paas mat aana
 The farmer questioned his ten-year rule on this
 jiske baad vidhayak ji ne fatkaar lagaate hue kisaan ko kamishnar ke paas jane ko kah diya
 The message being received by the farmers through the Sandesh Yatra for the farmers in Madhya Pradesh is not the right sign for the Shivraj government
 madhya pradesh ke alag-alag jilon se kisaanon kii aatmahatya kii khabaren aa rahi hai
 In such a situation, how much Shivraj's mlas care about the farmers' pain, it is clear from the video

 Despite being under pressure from different religions and film careers, the two have been playing each other for 25 years
 25 saal kii shaadi or uske pehle 6 saal kaa pyaar inke rishte ko sabake saamne adarsh ke rup main pesh karata he
 Shahrukh and Gauri is a perfect couple, and they know because of their perfect couple
 Anushka, Deepika hi nahin, is vajah se har ladki kar sakati he brallep
 
 
 1
 family kamitment:bollywood kaa sabase safal actor or duniya kaa doosraa sabase amir actor hone ke baavjoodshahrukhhameshaa apane parivaar ke liye samay nikaalte hai or wo apni family ke liye kaaphi protective bhi hai
 Gauri always stands with him whenever he needs them
 apnebacchonko bhi wo hameshaa media se dur hi rakhana chaahate hai
 Shahrukh is a perfect husband as well as a perfect father
 2
 Love: Shahrukh and Gauriki love-story is simple but very beautiful
 shahrukh gauri kii khubsuurati par mar-mite the vahiin gauri ko shahrukh kaa swabhaav, unka aatm-vishwaas kaaphi pasand aayaa tha
 It was not easy for both of them to get married
 shahrukh ko gauri ke parivaar ko manaane ke liye bahut mehnat kerani padi
 The reason for having a different religion was the problem as well that Shah Rukh was not a settlement at that time
 lekin donon parivaar ko manaane main safal rahe or 25 oktober,1991 ko donon shaadi ke bandhan main bandha gaye
 It was the commitment and love of both of them that they could fulfill their dreams
 3
 Biswas: Shahrukh's image has always been clear
 linoup kii khabaren har bollywood abhinayta kii jindagi kaa hissaa hote hai or shahrukh isse kaise batch sakate the
 For some time, his name was linked to Priyanka Chopra but at that time Gauri trusted him
 donon ek-duusare par puraa vishwaas karte hai or yahi unke safal shaadishuda jindagi kaa aadhaar he
 After breakup, do some makeup of life
 
 
 4
 Understanding and respecting each other: In today's time, women give more importance to career, which leads to Iago in the middle of the partners
 lekin gauri aisi nahin he
 Gauri initially played the role of a perfect mother and houselife
 lekin aisa nahin he ki gauri kii khud kii koi pahchaan nahin he
 He is a successful interior designer
 in sab ke baavjood gauri ne kariyar ko kabhi apane parivaar ke upar nahin samajha
 For all these reasons, Shah rukh-gauri's marriage is so successful
 5
 Common Friends: One reason for Shah Rukh and Gauri to be cool couples is that they both have a group of common friends
 unke doston main karan johar,farah khan, rithik raushan, sujain khan, chanki pandey, bhaavana pandey, farhaan akhtar, maheep kapur hai
 Both of these things make him a successful married couple

 iske alaava lagbhag 10 pratishat se log tanaav or uthkanthaa ke shikaar paae gaye
 The survey found that urban people were more in need of correcting mental health than rural people
 is beemaari ke lakshan mail or femail donon main samaan rup se paae gaye
 There have been more cases of mental illness in India in the last ten years than in China
 is par bhi 10 main se ek insaan ko hi apni is haalat kaa pataa chal pataa he
 In such a situation, there is a great need to be aware to deal with such diseases
 vitt varsh 2017-18 ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne 1
 5 lakh crore has been received as direct tax, but during this period there were some people who have not filed their income tax returns
 aay kar vibhaag ab inke khilaaf ection lene kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 The Income Tax Department fears that 65 lakh such people have not filed their returns last year, whose income is made according to the returns
 aise main ye sabhi log iti ke radar par hai
 Quoting an income tax official, the Times of India has told that even after reminding some people to fill the ITR many times, they have not filled the returns
 adhikari ne kaha ki ab ye log iskar vibhaag ke radar par hai
 6 in 2017-18 as per an analysis done by the Income Tax Department in 2017-18
 8 karod logon ne itiar file kiya
 This was a significant increase over the previous year
 adhikari ne bataaya ki karrwai ke dauraan aay kar vibhaganon-filer management systamke jariye ection le saktaa he
 He said that most of those people are on the income tax department's radar, who deposited Rs 10 lakh in old bank notes of 500 and 1000 rupees during demonetisation, but have not filed ITR
 is shrenee main aane vaale 3 lakh logon main se 2
 1 lakh people had filed ITR
 in logon ne 6,500 karod rupee self-acesment tex ke dauraan bharaa tha
 Earlier, the Income Tax Department had taken major action against the non-tax payers
 pichley hafte vibhaag ne aise 24 difolters kaa naam saarvajanik kar diya he, jin par 490 karod rupee kaa tex bakaayaa he
 The names of most of the people in this list include those who are out of hold or their property is much less than the arrears
 iskar vibhaag ne yah karrwai 'nem and shem difolters' policy ke tahat kii he
 Under this, the Income Tax Department has issued a public advertisement in the leading newspapers of the country
 muharram par shiyaon ke juluus ko lekar yogi sarkaar kii pahal safal rahi he
 The procession that usually led to the confrontation of Shias and Sunnis in Lucknow city on the day of Muharram, this time has been resolved by the Yogi government
 is baar moharram juluus nae raste se gujaregaa
 After the court's advisory to change the path of the Moharram procession, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath entrusted the responsibility of finding a solution to it to SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar and after negotiating with the Shia and Sunni clerics for several days, it was agreed to take the Moharram procession through the new route
 lakhanu main yogi sarkaar main pehali barmoharram kaa juluska rasta badla gaya he
 With the mutual consent of the administration and the Muslim Maulana, the way the Moharram procession was taken every year has been changed
 haalanki isaki vajah court kii ek adwajri maani ja rahi he, jisame swechha se raste ko badalane ke liye kaha tha, kyonki jis raste par yah juluus nikalataa tha, us raste me teen hospital padate the
 Therefore, due to the procession, the patients coming to the hospital had to face problems
 yogi sarkaar ke adhikariyon or prashasan ne muslim moulana se milakar raste ko badal diya he
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, Shia Maulana has expressed his happiness about the new path
 unka kahana he ki unhen jo nayaa rasta mila he, us par wo bina kisi pareshaani ke apane matam kaa juluus le ja sakate hai
 Deepak Kumar, SSP of Lucknow said that this is a historic change
 isse pehle kabhi bhi yah root nahin badal gaya or aaj aapasi sahmati se yah root badal gaya he, jisko sabhi moulana maan gaye
 In the case, Shia Maulana said that this is a good beginning for the government, which he thought about us and provided us a new path
 lakhanu juluus kaary samiti ke abbaas ne kaha ki yah juluus hameshaa se ek hi raste se nikalataa tha or aaj bhi nikalataa, lekin ham logon ne sarkaar ke prayaas or hospital kii vajah se rasta badal diya
 Now Moharram will be taken out from the other way, which has been fixed by the government

 Strict laws are in place to prevent atrocities on Dalits in other states of the country, but this was not the case in Jammu and Kashmir
 desh ke anya rajyon main alpsankhyakon ke hiton ke sangrakshan ke liye minurity act lagu he, lekin jammu-kashmir main aisa nahin tha
 In other states of the country, the Minimum Wages Act is in force to protect the interests of workers, but in Jammu and Kashmir it was available only on paper

 jaise panchayat ke chunaav paardarshita ke saath sampann karaae gaye, vaise hi vidhansabha ke bhi chunaav honge
 i would also urge the Governor of the state that the formation of the Block Development Council, which has been pending for the last two-three decades, should also be completed at the earliest
 unhone kaha ki mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki ab anuchhed 370 hatane ke baad, jab in panchayat sadasyon ko nai vyavastha main kaam karne kaa mauka milegaa to ve kamaal kar denge
 i am confident that the people of Jammu and Kashmir will defeat separatism and move forward with new hopes

 The repo rate can be cut in this meeting that starts on Tuesday
 agar aisa hota he to aam aadmi se lekar kaarobaariyon ko saste karj kaa tohfa milegaa
 But even this time, if the RBI does not cut the repo rate, then the common man may have to wait till February for cheap loans
 haalanki farvari main bhi arabiai kii maudrik niti samiti arthvyavastha kii chaal dekhakar hi faisla legi
 Today, there are many challenges before the RBI in the decision to cut the repo rate
 kam hua he dabaavamaudrik niti samiti kii baithak aise samay main ho rahi he, jab jidipi ke aankadon main sudhaar dekhne ko mila he
 This has improved the condition of the economy
 is sudhaar ko dekhte hue arabiai par byaaj daren kam karne kaa dabaav jarur kam hua he
 However, apart from GDP figures, the challenge of rising inflation and the ever increasing prices of crude oil will also be in front of him
 badi he mahangithok mahangaai dar or khudara mahangaai dar main ijapha hua he
 If you look at the wholesale inflation data for October released in November, it increased to 3
 56 fisadi ke str par aa gai he
 Retail inflation rate also 3 in October
 58 fisadi ke str par pahunch gai he
 The prices of food products are constantly increasing to increase inflation
 is baithak main arabiai ke paas badhati mahangaai ek badi chunauti rahegi
 Rise in oil prices: International crude oil prices are increasing constantly
 maujuuda samay main kaccha tel 60 dollar prati bairal pahunch gaya he
 Due to this, there is a possibility of rising prices of petrol and diesel in the country
 is vajah se byaaj daren ghataane or badhaane ko lekar faisla lete vakt arabiai kii samiti is par bhi vichaar karegi
 This factor will also play an important role in shaping the decision of the committee
 pichley kuch maheenon ke dauraan nijee kshetra kaa nivesh gata he
 The Monetary Committee of RBI will also discuss this and take a decision only after that
 jidipi kaa ye mil saktaa he phaaydajideepi ke aankadon main sudhaar aane kaa phayda growth projection main sudhaar ke taur par mil saktaa he
 Given the rise in GDP, RBI may improve the growth forecast of the economy

 Munde died in the morning after a road accident in Delhi
 shivasena ke pravaktaa sanjay raut ne kaha, maujuuda samay main vah dilli main rajya ke sabase sheersh netaa the
 Munde was a land leader and was extremely popular
 hamane kabhi unhen gussa hote nahin dekha or vah hameshaa party kaaryaktaaon ke bich paae jate the
 Not only Shiv Sena and BJP have lost a brilliant leader but Maharashtra has also suffered irreparable damage
 vah aise netaa the jinhen maharashtra or uski ‘asmita’ par garv tha
 Raut said, Munde ji had a very warm and affectionate relationship with the Shiv Sena leadership
 unhone shivasena-bhaajapa gathbandhan main nae sahyogiyon ko jodne ke liye kadi mehnat kii or haal main hue loksabhaa chunaavon main pashchimi maharashtra main congress-rakanpa ke garh main paith banaai
 He said, but Kismet also accepted something else
 mundeji kaa nidhan shivasena-bhaajapa hi nahin apitu maharashtra ke liye bhi kshati he
 Senior Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai said, Munde had an opportunity to showcase his talent at the national level after showcasing his leadership potential in Maharashtra
 yah du:kha kii baat he ki unka raajnneetik kaarykaal itane du:khad tareeke se samay se pehle hi samaapt ho gaya
 He said that just as the late Pramod Mahajan was considered the creator of the Shiv sena-bjp alliance, similarly Munde Swabhimani Shetkari organization's Raju Shetty, Mahadev Jankar of Rashtriya Samaj Paksha and Ramdas Athawale of RPI (A) were brought to the saffron side
 Became the creator of 'mahayuti' (vishal Alliance)
 desai ne kaha ki munde hameshaa sakaaratmak soch rakhte the or mushkil samay main himmat bandhaate the

 According to a report by Cric Info, the shoes were targeted at Chennai's fielder Ravindra Jadeja, who was posted near the borderline

 Rating: 4 Stardirector: Ali Abbas Zafarkalakar: The nine o'clock show by Salman Khan, Anushka Sharma and Randeep Hoodasubah, and the whistling noise in the hall amidst darkness
 yah shor kisi or ke liye nahin bollywood ke bhaijan or sultan salmaan khan ke liye thim
 Seeing the Sultan chirping the wrestlers in the arena, the spectators' seats started ringing, and there was tremendous noise
 phir agar single screen cinema ho to ye shor doguna ho jaataa he
 This cinema was about 70 percent full
 'prem ratan dhan payo' ke badasalmaan khan ne id par dastak de di he, or is baar phir ve imoshans ke saath jabardast ection kaa tufaan lekar aae hai, jaisaa unke phans ko ummid thi
 This time he has played the role of a wrestler on screen, and has also given his fans plenty of moments to whistle and be cool
 film kii sabase badi khaasiyat yah he ki salmaan khan ne gaanv ke sidhe-sade yuvak ke jariye bhi larger dain life hero pesh kiya he
 How much of the story in the story is the story of Rewari Kesselman Khan, who does cable TV business and who is thirty years old
 ve masti main laga rahata he or uske pita is baat se kuch khafa rahete hai
 But the sultan falls in love with Anushka and then the one who does not fall in love
 anoushka dosti karti he lekin desi launde aksar dosti ko pyaar samaj baithte hai
 The Sultan also makes the same mistake
 phir anoushka uske swabhimaan ko chunauti detii he tosultanki jindagi badal jaati he
 Then a storm of emotions begins
 kushti ke daanv-pench or bharpoor masala
 The story is such that in which there is a lot of love, action and emotions
 phir puri kahani main salmaan hi to chaaya he
 Star Appeal is Sasan Khan's Jadooah and devoted fans who love watching him do something onscreen
 salmaan ko daanv lagaate dekh is baat kaa andaja lagata he ki unhone film ke acchhee-khaasi mehnat kii he
 But the funny thing is that the brother has also shown the crash course of learning wrestling for wrestling lovers
 yah bhi samajha diya he ki umr sirf ek sankhya he
 Nothing more because the brothers start wrestling at the age of 30 and become state champions in a month
 vaaki ye salmaan hi kar sakate hai
 Anushka's acting is also fine
 haryani sunne main mjedaar lagati he
 Ali Abbas Zafar has given his mind a good chance to show his hands to the brother in the film and to play seats to his loved ones
 kamai kii batfilm kaa sangeet acha he, aurasalmaan ke chaahane waalon ko film dekhte samay anges karke rakhata he
 The budget of the film is about 90 crores
 bataaya jaataa he
 Sultan is released on Wednesday, thus it has five days in which it can earn a hefty amount
 vaise bhi salmaan khan record banane ke liye pahachaane jate hai, dekhnaa yah he ki is baar salmaan khan ke fain unhen kahaan tak lekar jate hai

 mujhe pataa he ki meraa janm ek hai profile or amir ghar main hua he, lekin aisa karke maine langig pakshpaat ke khilaaf aitihaasik udhaaharan diya he'

 (input:bhashaa) Nursery admission between the Delhi government and the school association can be prolonged
 darasal ravivaar ko dilli sarkaar ne abhibhavakon ke saath ek baithak kii thi
 During this time, many serious allegations were made on private schools like earning money in the name of management quota and rigging the admission process
 vahiin, in aaropon ko niraadhaar bataate hue skool esocysan ne dilli sarkaar ko aade haathon liya or kaha ki sarkaar privet skulon kii chhavi kharaab karne kii koshish kar rahi he
 Please tell that Education Minister Manish Sisodia in Delhi Government had said that he will not allow schools to become shops
 management kota hi ek aisa channel tha, jahaan se balldor admician ho sakate the
 It has been decided to remove this quota only after reading the previous order of the court
 pichley adeshon main adaalat ne management cote ko banaae rakhane kii baat nahin kii he
 This big statement by Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia undoubtedly raises many questions on the private schools in the capital
 lekin skool association kii maane to jin62 criteria ko lekardilli sarkaar ne skulon ke khilaaf itnaa sakht rukh apanaaya he, uske tahat 15 se 20 skulon hi aate hai
 While there are more than 1500 private schools in Delhi and they are following these rules completely
 privet skulon ke mutabik, dilli sarkaar ko sabhi skulon ko ek chashme se nahin dekhnaa chahie
 RC Jain, president of the Delhi State Public School Management Committee, says that the schools that did not follow the rules, the government could convene and negotiate
 lekin sabhi skulon par aise aarope lagaana uchit nahin he
 At the same time, SK Bhattacharya, chairman of the Action Committee for Unaided Public Schools, said that on the basis of which evidence, such allegations are being made on the schools
 privet skool nedilli sarkaar ke management kota khatm karne ke aadeshko avaidh bataate hue na sirf aadesh ko maanane se inkaar kiya he balki privet skulon ke kaam main dakhal dene kii bajaay sarkari skulon ke str ko behatar banaakar nursery class shuru karne kii naseehat di he
 Along with reminding the Delhi government of their election promise, the school association has also written a letter to the Directorate of Education, demanding that the order be repealed
 association ke mutabik agar sarkaar ne aadesh waapas nahin liya to phir ve court kaa rukh karengen
 It is clear from these taunts of the school association that this time Bhinarsari Admission will get entangled in the legal bets
 ab dekhnaa yah hoga ki aadesh naa maanane par sakht karrwai kii chetavanee dene vaali dilli sarkaar aise skulon par kya karrwai karti he! Union Minister AR Antulay has said that he is ready to resign

 We are very hopeful of getting a majority
 agar kisi karanvash bahumat nahin miltaa he, us dasha main ham sochenge ki kya karnaa he? jo bhi nattejey aayega, uske hisaab se kadam uthaaya jayega
 The BJP is already claiming that it is getting 150 seats

 After this, the Congress high command and MLA will decide jointly for the post of Chief Minister

 aaj 'aap' ke 67 vidhayak hai lekin hamen is par ghamand nahin karnaa chahie
 People chose AAP for 3 reasons
 Kokéjriwal said that people have voted for us for three reasons
 janata ko bhaashan nahin kaam chahie

 or yah duusari lahar us lahar se kahin zyada majboot or kendrit he jise hamane 2014 main dekha tha
 It is like the 2012 Obama wave
 2014 main bihar ke matadaataaon ne modi ko vikaas ke gujarat model ke peeche bhoomika nibhaane vaale shaks ke rup main pahachaanaa tha

 These elections have pushed the Congress to the margins
 rajd ne use bihar main keval nau siten di hai

 saamaanya shrenee ke aarthik rup se garib logon ko das fisadi aarakshan dene ke centre sarkaar ke faisle, pakistan par hawaii hamale or puure rajya kaa vidyutikaran—ye sab ve kadam hai jinase hamen laabh milegaa

 pichley chunaavon main bhi lalu baahar the or unhone jati va sampradayik aadhaar par dhruvikaran kii koshish kii thi, phir bhi bhaajapa ke netritv vaale endie ne 31 siten jiti thim
 Lalu's absence does not matter

 ghati main jab bijepi or pidipi kii sarkaar bani thi, tab kashmiri panditon ko ek ummid jaagi thi ki ab unki ghar vaapasi ko lekar sanjeeda tareeke se kadam uthaae jaaenge
 The Central Government may be serious, but the statements coming from the State Government are making the matter complicated
 jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said ne kaha, maine kendriya grahamantri se kah diya he ki kashmiri pandit waapas aana chaahate hai to aaen, unke liye alag colony nahin banaai jaaegi
 On this, Union Home Minister Kiran Rijiju said that political parties should say anything, but the government in the valley is of BJP and PDP and one has to listen to the other
 ve ishaara mufti sahab kii ore kar rahe the
 He also said that the Home Ministry has prepared a plan on how to settle Kashmiri Pandits back in the valley
 darasal, grahamantralay kaa kahana he ki ghati main panditon kii vishesh township ke liye sarkaar jameen dilaae
 NBCC has designed the architecture and design of this township
 srinagar main banane vaale 1000 apartment main kashmiri panditon ko flats die jaaenge, haalanki sthaneey logon ko bhi inamen flats lene kii chhot hogi
 On the other hand, Ram Madhav has also tweeted that both the governments have promised to settle Kashmiri Pandits
 ye colony sirf panditon ke liye hogi yaa fir sabake liye, yah bhi mudda he, lekin is mudde par kashmiri panditon kii raay bhi lee jaani chahie
 If religious and cultural diversity is to be maintained in Kashmir, they have to be brought back home with dignity
 darasal, jammu-kashmir main bijepi or pidipi kaa jo saajha nunatam kaarykram he, usamen 62,000 kashmiri pandit pariwaron ko phir se basaane kii baat bhi he
 How long will these 62,000 return, where will they return and how will they return? This is a big question
 bhartiya dalit sahitya main omprakash valmiki bada naam hai
 Not only Dalit discourse in his writing, the nuances of writing and concerns with literature are also present
 unke lekhan va sahitya main dalit vimarsh or anya muddon par unke vichaaron kaa upyogi sankalan he 'omprakash valmiki kaa antim samvaad
 'this book is based on the long conversation of Bhanwarlal Meena with him
 meena rajasthan ke adivasee kshetra main adhyaapan kaary karte hai
 The book has many relevant questions related to society, caste and religion, to which Valmiki has given a logical and unambiguous answer
 darrsal, yah kitaab maatr samvaad bhar nahin, sahitya main dalit vimarsh or samaaj main dalitotthana ke prayaason kaa ek paardarshee cheharaa he, jisamen unki kamiyaan evam achchhaaiyaan sab spasht ho gai hai
 Especially in the case of Dalit discourse, Valmiki has set examples by scrutinizing the entire history
 bade-bade lekhakon evam pathakon kii chook par unhone dridhtaa se na sirf ungali rakhi he balki sahi kya hona chahie, yah bhi sujhaayaa he
 In this context, the book becomes even more interesting
 dharm or jati se jude prashn hamaare desh main hameshaa hi jwalanth rahe hai
 Despite such a spate of education, casteism prevails in villages and cities
 jati ke naam par chunaav lade or jite jate hai
 Valmiki was well aware of the structure and thinking of our society
 is kitaab main unhone jatvaad ke alag-alag roopon kii charchaa kii he
 Casteism also has strong roots among the educated people of the cities
 yahaan tak ki jo videsh main rah aae hai ve bhi bharat main aakar vaisaa hi ravaiya apana lete hai
 There have been many examples of how the casteist system that has been in place for centuries is still alive in some form in the minds of the people
 marxvad ke vargeey avadharana ko nakaarte hue unka kahana he ki bharat main jati ek saamaajik sachaai he
 Many examples have proved this

 The issue that is being debated the most in Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections these days is the matter of banning the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 isi mudde par congress or bhartiya janata party aamane-saamne hai
 Attacking the Congress manifesto, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that the Sangh's branches would also be set up in government offices
 congress ne apane vachan patr main vaada kiya he ki vah sarkari sthanon main aresas kii shakhaon par bain lagaaegi
 On which Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has retaliated
 mukhyamantri shivaraj ne congress par hamalaa karte hue khargon main kaha ki sangh kii shakhaaen sarkari karyaalayon main bhi lagegi or sarkari karmchaaree bhi aresas kii shakha main hissaa lenge
 Nobody can stop it
 shivaraj somvaar ko khargon jile main ek chunavi sabha ko sambodhit karne pahunche the
 When reporters asked him questions related to the Congress manifesto, in response Shivraj gave the said statement
 unhone kaha ki sangh ke har aayojan main sabhi ko jane kii anumati aage bhi jari rahegi
 Chief Minister Shivraj, who came to the election meeting in support of the BJP candidate in Bedia of Barwah assembly constituency, described the Sangh as a patriot's organization and said that not only a government employee but every patriot can go to the Sangh branch
 chouhan ne kaha, 'maine hisanghki shakha me jane kaa pratibandh hataaya tha
 The Congress is living in ego, everyone will be left free to go to every event of the Sangh
 'samvidhan kii maryaada bhang kar rahe cmmukyamamwri shivaraj singh chouhan ke bayaan ke baad congress ke madhya pradesh prabharee deepak babariyaa ne kaha ki bijepi mudde se hatakar non ishyu par baat kar rahi he or vah aisa bayaan dekar samvidhan kii maryaada ko bhang kar rahe he
 He said that BJP is playing with the constitution as no government employees can be members of political party
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki jab bijepi ke paas bijli, kisaan, berogari or bhrashtachar se jude sawaalon kaa jawaab dene kii himmat nahin bachi to wo is tarah kii baton ko mudda bana rahi he
 The Congress had written a ban in its promissory note on the visit of the RSS branch and government employees in government buildings, which the BJP has made a big issue just before the elections
 haalanki congress is par safai di chuki he lekin lagata nahin he ki bijepi iske sahare congress ko gherne kaa koi mauka chhodana chaahati he
 Meanwhile, Jyotiraditya Scindia, president of the Congress State Election Campaign Committee, who came to campaign in the district, said on the issue that religion should not be brought into politics
 hamaara makasad he raajnneeti ko dharm se dur rakhana chahie
 He said that no government employees were associated with any political organization, so the Congress has included this issue in the promissory note

 vidhayakon ke offis of profit maamle par aam aadmi party ne sidhe chunaav ayog par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 The party has said that the Election Commission has given its decision by following the constitution and rules
 aap netaa sanjay singh ne lakhanu main 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit kiye jane ke chunaav ayog ke faisle par kaha ki ayog ne jo faisla kiya he wo galat he
 He said that the central government is engaged in killing democracy and the Election Commission has decided to keep the law and rules on hold
 unhone kaha ki chunaav ayog bhartiya janata party ke agent ke taur par kaam kar rahaa he
 Along with this, Sanjay Singh also said that the Election Commission gave its decision on Friday bypassing the decisions and directions of the Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki faisle se pehle vidhayakon ko apana paksh rakhane tak kaa mauka nahin diya gaya
 So, this is a sheer injustice to 20 mlas
 laabh kii detail densanjay singh ne chunaav ayog se party vidhayakon dwaara sansadeey sachiv ke taur par uthaae gaye laabh kii ditels bhi maangi
 He said that all our mlas are honest and they should be given information about what they got as parliamentary secretary
 sanjay singh ne chunaav ayog ke is faisle kii ninda karte hue kaha ki desh main apatkaal jaise halaat paidaa ho gaye hai
 Appointed in other states, Sanjay Singh argued in defense that in 2006, Sheila Dikshit gave the post of profit to 19 mlas in the Delhi government
 jharkhand or chhattisgarh main bhi sansadeey sachiv par vidhayakon ko niyukti di gayi
 In Haryana, 4 mlas were made parliamentary secretaries
 bengal, punjab main bhi aisa hua
 In Himachal, 11 parliamentary secretaries were given the post of profit
 sanjay singh ne bataaya ki desh ke duusare rajyon menhcourt ne sansadeey sachivonke pad ko radd kiya, lekin chunaav ayog ne kabhi bhi koi sadsyta radd nahin kii
 He hoped that the case would be heard in the High Court on Monday and the party would get relief

 i hope Virat will destroy all batting records but Sachin will remain Sachin

 If you ask Virat, he will also say the same thing, paazi is paazi
 ' vaise 36 varshiya harbhajan ne viraat ke batting form ko jamkar saraahaa
 He said that Kohli's passion for the game takes him to a different level
 viraat na keval khud feet hai balki dusron ko bhi fitness ke prati prerit karte hai

 udhar, aadhyatmik guru jaggi vasudev ke hisaab se hanuman tamil rahe honge kyonki ram ne tamilon kii madad se hi lanka par vijay hasil kii
 Since then, he has become the antithesis of the Tamils of Lanka! The late Rajendra Yadav, editor and scholar of the literary magazine Hans, may have called Hanuman the first terrorist of history in any article, because Hanuman had vandalized a sovereign state like Lanka
 , Did 'sabotage'
 lagata he littey waalon ne hanuman se hi prerana lekar suicide bambing jaise dussahas kaa prayog kiya tha
 Vasudev and Yadav seem to agree on one point here: They are followers of the LTTE Hanuman! a friend from the northeast has claimed that they were probably from Nagaland or Mizoram
 kyon? kyonki bagal main thailand, indonesia he
 Must have been from Mizoram
 vaise hanumanji, siyaasi taur par gaay se behatar sabit hue
 There was no lynching in the dispute over him yet

 Rather, say that he emerged as a symbol of all religion and harmony

 Recently, Shani Dev had a tough fight in terms of Hanuman's popularity
 shanidev kii murtiyon hanumanji ko kadi takkar de rahi thim
 Actually, Shani is considered the god of justice in Hindu astrology i
e
 neer-ksheer-vivek
 garibon, peediton or upekshiton ke devtaa
 If you want, you can also say communist (real ones!) To the gods
 ve vidrohi hai, satat ‘ribelle’
 He quarreled with father Surya in favor of his mother
 surya ke khilaaf rahu-ketu se dosti kar lee or surya ke samrajya main uthal-puthal machaa di
 There are black-bhujangs (this should not be considered racist comment)
 kaala rang vaise bhi ‘protest’ kaa pratik hua
 Recall the protests by the comrades wearing black cloth and black
 hamaare shani vahiin hai
 Secondly, Shani is also considered as the god of industry, business, enterprise, labor, iron and steel etc
 yani, jahaan-jahaan shramik, mashine hongi, shani kii mahatta badhegi
 On the map of India, Saturn's incineration has become very strong in industrial areas
 pehle hanumanji haaavee the
 In the British Raj, who went to Mauritius or South Africa to become plantations laborers or to lay railway lines, there was a burning of Bajrangbali among them
 lekin idhar kal-kaarkaanon or yahaan tak california ke software parks main bhi shani kii izzat badi he
 This also proves that Shani is a post-iron Age deity, while Hanuman is of the Stone Age
 aupniveshik drushti se or shwet-ashwet kii nigaah se dekhen to shani, ashweton ko devtaa hue or hanuman chunki ‘laal-deh-laali lasai’ hai to khate-pite-adhaate ghar ke bachche hue jo communist ban gaya he
 That is, if you want, say 'left-liberal'
 laal langot or sindur pote ve phul krantikari lagate hai
 There are also deal makers
 sugriv or ram ke bich samjhauta unheen ke dwaara hua-goyaa jyoti basu or rajeev gandhi kaa samjhauta ho! hanuman deal mekar hai, sattadhari varg ke nikat hai, budhimaan hai (sampadakeey prishthon par left-liberlon ke varchasv ko yaad kariye) or ladaaku bhi hai
 Kandhe Munj “janeu” Dress
 
 
 padhakar aisa lagata he goyaa koi makapa main gahare pawast hua brahman commered ho!hamaare vam-bandhu naahak hi hanuman se ab tak dur rahe
 Should have already adopted
 laal salaam or laal-langot kaa kya hi gajab mail baithta
 Popularity and acceptance also increases, for which they remain infuriated
 dharmik kahaniyon main hanuman ne shani kii bhi ek baar baari madad kii thi
 When Ravana tied Saturn, Hanuman was the only one who came to work at the time of the burning of Lanka
 usase pehle ve surya ko fal samajhakar nigal gaye the
 Darap-suppressed the Sun just as Krishna did to Govaraja Indra by raising Govardhana
 hamaare dharm main pratirodh kaa har pratik maujuud he
 Therefore every Shani temple has Bajrangbali in front
 hanuman bhakton ko shani baari relif dete hai
 Overall, there is a feeling in the public's mind that Hanuman stayed twenty on Saturn
 kehete hai hanuman, rudra (yani mahadev!) ke ek avatar hue or mahadev kii bhi lokapriyata akhil bhartiya he
 They too cannot be tied into any one caste-sect
 kya dackhin kya uttar har jagah unki tiarapy jabardast he
 Perhaps this is also a reason for Hanuman claiming so much
 kul milakar hanuman is vibhaajak samay main eka ke bade sutara banakar ubhare hai
 We need to celebrate it and if possible, in this intensive era of idol-making, we should undertake a campaign to install a huge statue of Hanuman at the headquarters of the United Nations which competes with Hanuman of Karol Bagh

 This book of Urdu has been distributed by the Directorate of Education, (basic) Text Book Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh to children from class one to eight
 shiksha satr 2013-14 ke liye yah pustak janvari main skulon main vitarit kii gai
 The extent of this is that in the book, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's death is shown before he becomes Prime Minister
 kaksha 7 kii pustak 'hamaari jubaan' main pej number 33 par desh ke pehle pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru kii chitthee 'baap kaa khat beti ke naam' ramayana or mahabharat sheershak se likhi gai he
 It depicts Nehru's death in 1946, the year before independence, while he died on 27 May 1964 and was prime minister from 1947 to 1964
 is kitaab ke anusaar, nehru apni maut hone ke baad pradhanmantri bane or 17 varsh is jimmedaari ko nibhaayaa
 In addition, the book has a lot of mistakes
 pehali pustak kaksha ek se kaksha 4 tak 'jubaan kii kiran', duusari pustak kaksha 5 ke liye 'chahak' or teesri pustak 'hamaari jubaan' he
 This class is from 6 to 8
 kaksha 3 kii pustak main hi taharik aazaadee kaa matlab sirf andolan samajhaayaa gaya he, jabaki desh kii aazaadee ke liye andolan hona chahie tha
 Questions are being raised on the number of mistakes in the books, because the Basic Education Council's committee decides on the syllabus on the consent of the state government
 paathya pustak tay hone ke baad screening cameti check karke galtiyaan sudhaarti he
 After being published in the press, the language committee provides proof reading and then the book is made available

 The Seventh Pay Commission (7TH Pay Commission) surrounded the central employees with as many dilemmas as they brought the happiness of the employees
 iske lagu hone ke baad se kai muddon ko lekar karmchaariyon ne apni naaraazgi jataai
 In view of the displeasure of employees on issues ranging from minimum wage to several allowances, the government made a committee and tried to resolve it
 teen samitiyon main ek samiti alouns ko lekar banaai gai thi
 The committee, chaired by Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa, has so far held about 15 meetings and on the 6th, the last round of talks between the staff representative and the government representatives on this committee also ended
 karmchaaree sanghathanon ke sanyukt sangh ensigesiem ke sanyojak shiv gopal mishra ne enditivi ko bataaya ki guuruuvaar ko alouns samiti kii antim daur kii baithak hui jiske baad is mudde par ab aage or baatcheet nahin hogi
 Mishra told NDTV that this committee will now submit its report to the cabinet in two-four days
 mana yah bhi ja rahaa he ki agle saptaah hone vaali cabinet kii baithak main yah report prastut ho sakati he
 After the decision in this meeting can come any good news for the central employees
 ullekhanayi he ki samitiyon kii report chaar maheenon main aa jaani chahie thi lekin deree ke kaaran kendriya karmchaaree naaraaz hai
 Staff leader Shiv Gopal Mishra had also met the Cabinet Secretary in this regard and informed the government about the feelings of the employees
 shiv gopal mishra ne pehle bataaya tha ki teen taarikh ko bhi railmantri se mulaakaat kii gai thi
 In this meeting also, information was given to the Railway Minister and other top officials about the huge anger against the railway employees' allowance, minimum wage and fitment formula, NPS and pension
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Till now, the government had announced the formation of three committees to resolve the questions raised after the employees' displeasure over the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission
 saatven vetan ayog kii report main alouns ko lekar hue vivaad se judi ek samiti, duusari samiti pension ko lekar or teesri samiti vetanman main kathith visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai thi
 The most important committee is formed with discrepancies
 is anomali samiti kaa naam diya gaya he
 The same committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale
 chaturth shreniyon ke karmchaariyon ke nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi is teesri samiti kaa paas he
 The same committee is talking to employee organizations seeking to raise the minimum pay scale
 vitt sachiv kii adhyakshata main is samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 The committee consists of secretaries from six ministries
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon kii ore karmchaaree sanghathan ne maang kii he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae
 The organization has asked the committee of secretaries that the transport allowance be revised according to inflation
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah maang kii he ki bacchon kii shiksha ke liye diya jane vaale alouns ko kam se kam 3000 rupee rakhaa jaae
 The organization has also demanded a medical allowance of Rs 2000
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah bhi kaha he ki kai alouns jo saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kiye hai unpar punarvichaar kiya jaae
 It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 The most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he
 Convener of NCJCM, a union of employees' organizations, Shiv Gopal Mishra told NDTV that the final round meeting of the Allowance Committee was held on Thursday, after which no further discussion on the issue will take place
 mishra ne enditivi ko bataaya ki yah samiti ab do-chaar din main apni report cabinet ko saunp degi
 It is also believed that this report can be presented in the cabinet meeting to be held next week
 is baithak main nirnay hone ke baad kendriya karmchaariyon ke liye koi acchhee khabar aa sakati he
 It is noteworthy that the report of the committees should have come in four months but the central employees are angry due to the delay
 is sambandh main karmchaariyon ke netaa shiv gopal mishra ne cabinet sachiv se mulaakaat bhi kii thi or sarkaar ko karmchaariyon kii bhaawanaaon se avgat karaayaa tha
 Shiv Gopal Mishra had earlier told that the Railway Minister was also met on the 3rd
 is baithak main bhi railway karmchaariyon kii alouns, minimum veg or fitment formula, enpies or pension ko lekar baari rosh ke bare main railmantri sahit anya bade adhikariyon ko jaankaree di gai thi
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the 7th Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 ab tak 7wein vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lekar karmchaariyon kii naaraazgi ke baad uthe sawaalon ke samaadhaan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se teen samitiyon ke gathan kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 In the report of the Seventh Pay Commission, a committee was formed on the dispute regarding allowance, the second committee was on the issue of pension and the third committee was made about the alleged discrepancies in the pay scale
 sabase ahm samiti visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai he
 This anomaly committee has been named
 isi samiti ke paas nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi he
 This third committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale of the fourth category employees
 yahi samiti nunatam vetanman ko badhaane kii maang karne vaale karmchaaree sanghathanon se baat kar rahi he
 This committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the Finance Secretary
 samiti main chah mantralayon ke sachiv shaamil hai
 It is noteworthy that the employees' organization has demanded that the HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula
 sanghathan ne sachivon kii samiti se kaha he ki transport alouns ko mahangaai ke hisaab se reshnalise kiya jaye
 The organization has demanded from the government that the allowance given for the education of children should be kept at least Rs 3000
 sanghathan ne medical alouns kii rakam bhi 2000 rupee karne kii maang kii he
 The organization has also asked the government to revisit several allowances which the Seventh Pay Commission has abolished
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne transport alouns (yatra bhatta) ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees
 kya yah dar 1
 1
 16 se lagu kii gai he yaa phir 1
 4
 17 se yah lagu hogi
 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that in its report, the Pay Commission had initially fixed the HRA at 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held
 ullekhanayi he ki samitiyon kii report chaar maheenon main aa jaani chahie thi lekin deree ke kaaran kendriya karmchaaree naaraaz hai
 Staff leader Shiv Gopal Mishra had also met the Cabinet Secretary in this regard and informed the government about the feelings of the employees
 shiv gopal mishra ne pehle bataaya tha ki teen taarikh ko bhi railmantri se mulaakaat kii gai thi
 In this meeting also, information was given to the Railway Minister and other top officials about the huge anger against the railway employees' allowance, minimum wage and fitment formula, NPS and pension
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Till now, the government had announced the formation of three committees to resolve the questions raised after the employees' displeasure over the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission
 saatven vetan ayog kii report main alouns ko lekar hue vivaad se judi ek samiti, duusari samiti pension ko lekar or teesri samiti vetanman main kathith visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai thi
 The most important committee is formed with discrepancies
 is anomali samiti kaa naam diya gaya he
 The same committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale
 chaturth shreniyon ke karmchaariyon ke nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi is teesri samiti kaa paas he
 The same committee is talking to employee organizations seeking to raise the minimum pay scale
 vitt sachiv kii adhyakshata main is samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 The committee consists of secretaries from six ministries
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon kii ore karmchaaree sanghathan ne maang kii he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae
 The organization has asked the committee of secretaries that the transport allowance be revised according to inflation
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah maang kii he ki bacchon kii shiksha ke liye diya jane vaale alouns ko kam se kam 3000 rupee rakhaa jaae
 The organization has also demanded a medical allowance of Rs 2000
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah bhi kaha he ki kai alouns jo saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kiye hai unpar punarvichaar kiya jaae
 It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 The most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai
 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he
 Shiv Gopal Mishra had earlier told that the Railway Minister was also met on the 3rd
 is baithak main bhi railway karmchaariyon kii alouns, minimum veg or fitment formula, enpies or pension ko lekar baari rosh ke bare main railmantri sahit anya bade adhikariyon ko jaankaree di gai thi
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the 7th Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 ab tak 7wein vetan ayog kii siforeeshon ko lekar karmchaariyon kii naaraazgi ke baad uthe sawaalon ke samaadhaan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se teen samitiyon ke gathan kaa elaan kiya gaya tha
 In the report of the Seventh Pay Commission, a committee was formed on the dispute regarding allowance, the second committee was on the issue of pension and the third committee was made about the alleged discrepancies in the pay scale
 sabase ahm samiti visangatiyon ko lekar banaai gai he
 This anomaly committee has been named
 isi samiti ke paas nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi he
 This third committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale of the fourth category employees
 yahi samiti nunatam vetanman ko badhaane kii maang karne vaale karmchaaree sanghathanon se baat kar rahi he
 This committee has been formed under the chairmanship of the Finance Secretary
 samiti main chah mantralayon ke sachiv shaamil hai
 It is noteworthy that the employees' organization has demanded that the HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula
 sanghathan ne sachivon kii samiti se kaha he ki transport alouns ko mahangaai ke hisaab se reshnalise kiya jaye
 The organization has demanded from the government that the allowance given for the education of children should be kept at least Rs 3000
 sanghathan ne medical alouns kii rakam bhi 2000 rupee karne kii maang kii he
 The organization has also asked the government to revisit several allowances which the Seventh Pay Commission has abolished
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne transport alouns (yatra bhatta) ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees
 kya yah dar 1
 1
 16 se lagu kii gai he yaa phir 1
 4
 17 se yah lagu hogi
 As far as the employees are concerned, they have been demanding to implement it since January last year and some time ago there was a hint from the government that all the disputed allowances will be implemented from 1 April 2017
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki karmchaariyon kii maang he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae yaa phir isaki dar badhaai jaae
 Central employees say that currently HRA employees are getting less than earlier as per the fixed formula
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog (seventh Pay Commission) dwaara kendriya karmchaariyon ko die jane vaale kai bhatton ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti he
 The Narendra Modi government had approved the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission in 2016 and implemented the 7th Pay Commission report from 1 January 2016
 lekin, bhatton ke saath kai muddon par asahmati hone kii vajah se in siforishein puri tarah se lagu nahin ho pain
 It is being said that the officials authorized to negotiate on behalf of the government have agreed to raise the HRA to 1 level, now the HRA can be up to 30%, 20% and 10%
 vahiin, vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se khabar mil rahi he ki bade shaharon main ise 30 pratishat kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah abhi tay nahin he
 The employees' organization has said that if the government has not increased the HRA, how can it be reduced
 apane tark ke samarthan main karmchaariyan kii daleel he ki kya shaharon main makaan kaa kiraaya kam hua he
 Have houses become cheap? jab yah nahin hua he to sarkaar apane karmchaariyon ke saath anyaay kaise kar sakati he
 Explain that in its report, the Pay Commission had initially fixed the HRA at 24%, 16% and 8% and stated that when the DA reaches 50 percent it will be 27%, 18% and 9%
 Will be respectively
 itnaa hi nahin vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne yah bhi kaha tha ki jab die 100% ho jayega tab yah dar 30%, 20% or 10% kramash : eks, vaai or jed shaharon ke liye ho jaaegi
 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees are not getting their direct benefits , then the employees feel that the Pay Commission report has not been implemented yet
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held

 In support of their argument, the workers argue that the rent of the house has come down in the cities
 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai
 When this has not happened how can the government do injustice to its employees
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he
 The most important committee is formed with discrepancies
 is anomali samiti kaa naam diya gaya he
 The same committee also has the issue of minimum pay scale
 chaturth shreniyon ke karmchaariyon ke nunatam vetanman kaa mudda bhi is teesri samiti kaa paas he
 The same committee is talking to employee organizations seeking to raise the minimum pay scale
 vitt sachiv kii adhyakshata main is samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 The committee consists of secretaries from six ministries
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon kii ore karmchaaree sanghathan ne maang kii he ki echaare ko puraane formule ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaae
 The organization has asked the committee of secretaries that the transport allowance be revised according to inflation
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah maang kii he ki bacchon kii shiksha ke liye diya jane vaale alouns ko kam se kam 3000 rupee rakhaa jaae
 The organization has also demanded a medical allowance of Rs 2000
 sanghathan ne sarkaar se yah bhi kaha he ki kai alouns jo saatven vetan ayog ne samaapt kiye hai unpar punarvichaar kiya jaae
 It is believed that the government has divided the Transport Allowance (traveling Allowance) into two parts
 ek sisie or doosraa purvavat kii tarah diya jane vaala tie he
 It is believed that this will be payable like the Fifth Pay Commission
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki inako die se alag kar diya jayega or yah fiks slab rate par tay hoga
 The most important question still remains as to how long the government has agreed to give the HRA
 yah prashn abhi bhi karmchaariyon ko sata rahaa he
 Does this rate 1
 1
 16 or 1 is applied
 4
 With effect from 17, it will be applicable
 jahaan tak karmchaariyon kaa sawaal he vah ise pichley saal janvari se lagu karwaane kii maang karte rahe hai or sarkaar kii ore se kuch samay pehle aisa ishaara mila tha ki sabhi vivaadit alouns ko 1 april 2017 se lagu kiya jayega
 For information, let us tell that the demand of employees is that HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula or its rate should be increased
 kendriya karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki vartmaan main tay formula ke hisaab se echaare karmchaariyon ko pehle kii tulana main kam milane laga he
 Let me tell you that there is confusion about many allowances given to the Central Employees by the Seventh Pay Commission
 narendra modi sarkaar ne 2016 main saatven vetan ayog (7th Pay Commission) kii siforeeshon ko manjuuri di thi or 1 janvari 2016 se 7wein vetan ayog kii report ko lagu kiya tha
 However, due to disagreement on several issues with allowances, these recommendations were not fully implemented
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se baatcheet ke liye adhikrut adhikari echaare ko 1 str upar karne ko taiyaar hue hai ab echaare 30%, 20% or 10% tak ho saktaa he
 At the same time, reports are being received from reliable sources that 30 percent can be done in big cities, but it is not decided yet
 karmchaaree sanghathan kaa kahana rahaa he ki agar sarkaar ne echaare badhaayaa nahin he to gata kaise sakati hai

 kya makaan saste ho gaye hai

 It is noteworthy that the employees' organization has demanded that the HRA should be decided on the basis of the old formula
 sanghathan ne sachivon kii samiti se kaha he ki transport alouns ko mahangaai ke hisaab se reshnalise kiya jaye
 The organization has demanded from the government that the allowance given for the education of children should be kept at least Rs 3000
 sanghathan ne medical alouns kii rakam bhi 2000 rupee karne kii maang kii he
 The organization has also asked the government to revisit several allowances which the Seventh Pay Commission has abolished
 mana ja rahaa he ki sarkaar ne transport alouns (yatra bhatta) ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the CCA and the other is the TA given as undone
 yah paanchaven vetan ayog kii bhaanti dey hoga, aisa mana ja rahaa he
 It is also being said that they will be separated from DA and this fix will be fixed at slab rate
 sabase ahm sawaal ab bhi bana hua he ki sarkaar ne echaare ko kab se dene kii baat ko sweekaar kiya he
 This question is still haunting the employees

 It is noteworthy that in the memorandum related to their demand before the pay commission constituted by the joint organization of employees, NJCA asked for this rate to be 60%, 40% and 20% respectively
 sanghathan kaa aarope he ki ayog ne karmchaariyon kii maang ko puri tarah se thukraa diya tha
 He says that the Pay Commission has reduced this rate from the Sixth Pay Commission
 inkaa kahana he ki kyonki ise die ke saath joda gaya he to yah tabhi badhegaa jab die kii dar tay pratishat tak bad jaaegi
 The comments jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki saatvaan vetan ayog se pehle kendriya karmchaaree 196 kism ke alounces ke hakdaar the
 But the Seventh Pay Commission abolished or merged many allowances, leaving only 55 allowances left
 tamaam karmchaariyon ko kai alouns samaapt hone kaa malaal he
 Because many allowances have not been implemented yet and the employees have not received their direct benefits, the employees feel that the Pay Commission report is not yet implemented
 bataa den ki saatven vetan ayog kii report se karmchaariyon kii kai shikaayatein rahi hai or aise main centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne apane karmchaariyon kii shikayaton ko dur karne ke liye sambandhit mantralay or vittamantralay ke adheen samitiyon kaa gathan kiya he
 These committees are talking to the staff leaders and these committees had to give their decision to the government in four months, but so far only the final committee meeting has been held
 bataa den ki vetan ayog (pe kamishan) ne apni report main echaare ko aarambh main 24%, 16% or 8% tay kiya tha or kaha gaya tha ki jab die 50 pratishat tak pahunch jayega to yah 27%, 18% or 9% kramash: ho jayega
 Not only this, the Pay Commission had also said that when DA becomes 100%, then the rate will be 30%, 20% and 10% for X, y and z cities respectively
 ullekhneey he ki karmchaariyon ke sanyukt sanghathan enzesie ne gathit vetan ayog ke samaksh apni maang se sambandhit gyaapan main is dar ko kramash: 60%, 40% or 20% karne ke liye kaha tha
 The organization alleges that the commission completely rejected the employees' demand
 unka kahana he ki vetan ayog ne is rate ko chathe vetan ayog se bhi kam kar diya he
 They say that because it is combined with DA, it will increase only when the DA rate increases by a fixed percentage
 tippaniyan For information, let us know that before the Seventh Pay Commission, central employees were entitled to 196 types of allowances
 lekin saatven vetan ayog ne kai alounces ko samaapt kar diya yaa phir unhen mila diya jiske baad keval 55 alouns baaki rah gaye
 Many employees are sorry for ending many allowances
 kyonki kai alouns abhi tak lagu nahin hue or karmchaariyon ko uskaa sidhaa laabh nahin mila he to karmchaariyon ko lag rahaa he ki vetan ayog kii report abhi lagu nahin hui
 Explain that there have been many complaints of employees from the report of the Seventh Pay Commission and in such a situation the Narendra Modi government of the Center has set up committees under the concerned Ministry and Ministry of Finance to address the grievances of its employees
 ye samitiyaan karmchaaree netaaon se baat kar rahi hai or is samitiyon ko apana faisla chaar maheene main sarkaar ko dena tha lekin abhi tak keval alouns samiti kii hi antim baithak hui he

 hamaare daur ke sarvaadhik pratibhashali kaviyon main se ek kunwar narayan kii aaj jayanti he
 Kunwar Narayan was born on September 19, 1927
 unhone lakhanu vishvavidhyalay se 1951 main angrezi sahitya main eme kiya
 From 1973 to 1979 he was also the Deputy Chairperson of the 'sangeet Natak Academy'
 1975 se 1978 tak vah sachchidanand hiranand vatsyayan agyeya dwaara sampadit masik patrika ke sampadak mandal ke sadsy bhi rahe
 In the year 2005, Kunwar Narayan was conferred with Jnanpith Award, the highest honor of the literary world
 iske alaava unhen 1995 main sahitya academy puraskaar va 2009 main desh ke duusare sabase bade sammaan 'padam vibhushan' se bhi alankrita kiya gaya tha
 When Kunwar Narayan died at the age of 90 on November 15, 2017, Hindi literature had become very rich with his poems
 kunwar narayan ne hindi sahitya ko apni vividh kritiyon se nawaja
 His poetic goals were as bright as his faith in a human-like person
 kaha jaataa he ki kunwar narayan kii kavitaayen apane samay se samvaad thim
 They have a passion for existence
 unki rachanaaon main kavita sangrah: chakravyuuh, teesraa saptak, parivesh: ham tum, aatmajayi, apane saamne, koi doosraa nahin, in dinon, vajashrava ke bahaane, haashiye kaa gavaah pramukh hai, to kahani sangrah: aakaaron ke aasapaas or samiksha pustak: aaj or aaj se pehle jaisi kritiyaan kaaphi charchit raheen
 The book 'words and Deshkaal' is a unique example of his wealth of thought
 isamen vibhinn avasaron par die gaye vyakhya ke saath lekh bhi hai
 His views on language, literature, society, media, translation and other questions demand a careful reading
 vishwa-vivek ke saath chintan karanevaale, kunwar narayan ke ye lekh pathak ko tathvik rup se samrudh karte hai
 Kunwar ji sees literature not only from the point of view of literature but also from the point of view of economics, science, political, history, scriptures etc
 iske mul main sahitya ke prati un kii akhand aasthaa he jisaki taraf ve sanket karte hai, ''sahitya kii 'jagah' kitni hi choti kyon na ho, 'samay' bada hota he
 "read this excerpt from his book 'aadhar and Deshkal' on the birth anniversary of Kunwar Narayan today on Aaj Tak: Future of Hindi - Hindi of the future
 i am not a linguist in the typical classical sense, nor a theorist of literature, but Hindi as a poet and writer
 i would like to say a few things based on my experiences of using language in a constructive way
 hindi is samay sansar main boli jane vaali pramukh bhashaaon main se maani jaati he
 Other languages are English, Chinese and Spaniard languages
 bhashaai aankade bataate hai ki is samay duniya main 6000 se adhik bhashaaen boli ja rahi hai lekin jis tezi se choti bhashaaon kaa lop ho rahaa he usase yah andeshaa bhi pusht hota lagata he ki is sahasrabdi ke ant hote-hote inamen se 600 bhashaaen bhi nahin bachengi! hindi kaa bhashaai bhavishya ujjwal he
 From the point of view of a creator, i try to read the pulse of the rapidly changing Hindi language, making a fine distinction between 'change' and 'development'
 yah ‘badlaav’, or uski ‘tezi’, hindi ke swabhaav par kis tarah kaa gunatmak asar daal rahe hai? yah gunatmak-paksh sahitya ke liye khaas maane rakhata he jo multah ‘maanviya’ or jivan kaa ‘athmiya’ paksh he
 It is reflected and expressed in literature in many ways
 vah bhashaa sabase pehle aapasi sauhardra, sahanubhuti, saujany or sahishnutaa kii deergh samskruti kii bhashaa he, jisamen ham apane ek sabhy manushya hone kii sabase moolyawaan chhavi ko pahachaanate hai
 It is easy to note that by Hindi language i mean here from that broad perspective of Hindi which includes literature of Urdu and local dialects
 vishwa-stareey or kaaljayi sahitya tab bhi diya he jab vah ‘vaishvik bhashaa’ nahin thi, keval chote-chote ‘kshetron’ kii bhashaa thi
 It is also a time to remember when the work of keeping the whole of India in an emotional thread was made possible by devotional poetry and arts - despite political rivalries and beatings
 aaj bhi duniya kii tamaam choti-choti bhashaaen vishwa-stareey mahaan sahitya de rahi hai
 It would be enough to take a look at the list of Nobel-laureates to confirm the fact that 'big' language is not mandatory for the creation of 'big' literature
 angrezi bhi ek choti hi bhashaa thi jab shakespeare kii rachanaaon ne use ek bahut badi bhashaa bana diya
 Similarly, the extraordinary linguistic ability of Awadhi and Brij cannot be fully understood without the literary contribution of Kabir, Jayasi, Tulsi, Sur etc
 ek dussahasik dhang kaa soch bhi man main aata he ki bade sahitya ke liye shaayad badi bhashaa koi bahut bada vardaan nahin he
 The expansion of a language is due to many reasons - mainly due to commercial, industrial, economic, political etc
 ye hi kaaran aaj hindi bhashaa ke vistaar ke peeche bhi saafe pahachaane ja sakate hai
 From the political, economic and industrial point of view, India and China are no longer backward countries
 is vikaas ke saath-saath hi bhashaa kaa mahatva bhi na keval badha he balki unka ‘istemaal’ bhi badla he or bahut tezi se badal rahaa he- lagbhag mashin-yug kii raftaar se
 Roughly speaking, language is becoming more 'mechanistic' than 'human'! Language's commercial and transactional idioms and vocabulary seem to be more functional than the human qualities of the language, hence more relevant
 aapasi sambandhon, hamadardi or gahare maanviya sarokaaron kii bhashaa bejaan-si lagati he
 It is not just a linguistic crisis, it is a shadow of the crisis that lingers on towards the language, which points towards life becoming increasingly insensitive today
 aaj bhi jab ham ek loakgeet ko sunate hai yaa aanchalik kavy yaa upanyaas ko padhate hai to usamen bhashaa kii ek khaas tarah kii komalta, bhaavnaatmak eemaandaaree or athmiya bhai-chaare kii garima ko barqaraar pate hai
 In today's industrial, commercial and consumer society, which are becoming absolutely temporary and meaningful relations
 unki bhashaa main gahare or udaatt maanviya sambandhon or soch-vichaar ke liye kitni jagah bachati he yah chintaa keval sahitya kii hi nahin, har aadmi kii honi chahie
 If there is a correlation between literature coming from small languages, that these languages are still remaining in their intimacy and heat, then the reason for this is also the lifestyle which changes less in small places than in big cities
 bhashaa main parivartan or vikaas jivan ke saath ghanishtha rup se judaa hota he jise vyakaran ke niyam nahin jivan kii gati nirdhaarit karti he, multah jaivik dhang se
 The journey of development from Sanskrit to Hindi can also be understood in almost the same way as we understand the long historical journey of man
 jis tarah ham jivan or itihaas kii gatiyon ko ek sidhi rekha main rakhkar nahin soch sakate, bahut kuch bhashaa kii gati bhi usee tarah jatil or tedi-medhi chalati he
 The river Ganges at its origin is not the same river that falls in the Bay of Bengal
 usamen bich ke pradeshon main bahanevaali tamaam choti-badi nadiyon kaa pani bhi is tarah shaamil ho chukaa hota he ki unhen phir se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 They all become the mainstream of the Ganges
 hindi bhashaa ke vikaas ko bhi kuch-kuch isi tarah samajha janaa chahie
 When raising the problem of 'dehumanization' with the expansion of language, one should not rush to a simple conclusion
 bhashaa keval ek yaa do staron par hi nahin kai staron par ek saath viksit hoti he
 With the change in physical life, the change on the upper surface of the language - that is, in our language of speech, behavior, transactions, commerce, trade, etc
 - appears first and foremost but, like the nature of man, his language Also has many internal layers
 ve aasaani se nahin badalatin kyonki unamem sadiyon ke sanskaar or chintan kii smritiyaan agochar rup se dabi-chhipi vidyaman rahati hai
 Broadly speaking, it can be called the 'subconscious' of language, which has an unbreakable mental connection from 'private' to 'collective'
 is sutarabaddhata kii kunjee kahin hamaare jeens main he, isiilie jivan or bhashaa ke vikaas kii gati judawaan maani gai he
 The multiplicity of a language is a sign of its awareness
 vah agar ek str par bolchaal, len-dein, lok-jivan kii vyaavhaarik bhashaa ho sakati he to duusare str par soch-vichaar, chintan-manan, adhyayan-gyaan kii gudh bhashaa bhi
 The logic of high and low does not apply to both
 ye bhashaa ke do bilkul bhinn tarah ke upyog hai tathaa uski samarthy ko batalaate hai
 Language not only creates itself at the level of daily life but also at the level of ideological and self-thinking, and both these sides of the language are justified because both together give us a larger life- vision
 isi tarah sahitya or kalaon kii bhashaaen bhi is maane main vishisht or jaays bhashaaen hai ki ve jivan kii ek bhinn prakaar kii vyanjana or abhivyakti ko sambhav banaati hai
 Like life, we will not be able to assimilate the whole life force of this 'variation' of language without accepting it generously
 hindi bhashaa ke bhavishya ko sochate hue kuch baaten khaastaur par man main uthati hai
 Memories of thousands of years of good and bad historical experiences have got mixed up in 'prakriti' of Hindi language
 isamen jamini sachai bhi he or anek udaatt vichaaron or kalaon ke anubhav bhi
 Hundreds of years of intense Vedic, Vedantic, Sufi-thinking, arts and poetry have left an indelible mark on the language, which even today it is difficult to separate from the nature of Hindi language
 vichaaron, saahitiyon or kalaon kaa dabaav bhi ek bhashaa ko apni tarah rachataa or use sakasham banaata he
 Sometimes this effect is more powerful than the pressures of daily reality
 jab buddha-vichaar madhya asia main failaa to asia kii shaayad hi aisi koi bhashaa rahi ho jo usase aprabhavit rahi ho
 In many languages a different level of language was created for the ideas of Buddha
 aadhunik samay main bhi ham dekhte hai ki kisi bade vichaar ke saath uski apni ek vishisht bhashaa, vimarsh kii bhashaa, bhi aati he
 He has a dominance of his own and sometimes he overshadows common language for long and long
 aadhunik samay main vigyaan ke saath tark or vishleshan jaise shabdon kaa dabadabaa lagbhag har prakaar kii soch kii bhashaa par haaavee rahaa he
 The prime example is the thinking of Marx and Freud
 jinhone beesvin sadi kii puri soch ko dur tak prabhavit kiya he
 Whatever is rational is right
 yah baat kuch itani pakki tarah hamaare dimaag main baith gai he yaa baitha di gai he, ki koi sachai tark se pare bhi ho sakati he ise ham vichaarneey hi nahin maananaa chaahate
 Logic is not infallible
 vitark or kutark bhi uske saath jude hote hai
 It is difficult to say what form of Hindi will develop in the future, but there is a dream somewhere in the mind that the meaning of Hindi should not be limited to only things and their consumption
 vah ek aisi aatm-samskruti or jivan-vivek kii samarth awaz bhi ban sake jisaki shakti ko bharat jaise desh ne apane lambe or visham aitihaasik anubhavon se guzarate hue kai tarah janaa or pramanit kiya he

 In the country today, Pauri's Dunka district of Uttarakhand is ringing
 puure desh ke sheersh suraksha padon par baithe sabhi bade adhikari paudi jile se hi aate hai
 Not only here, Yogi Adityanath, the head of the country's largest state Uttar Pradesh, is also himself from Panchur village of Pauri
 uttarakhand ke mukhyamantri bhi isi jile ke kharesend gaanv se hai
 Pauri is not far behind in giving big leaders and officials of the country along with Uttarakhand
 purv mukhyamantri bhuwan chand khanduri se lekar vijay bahuguna, harak singh ravat, satpal maharaj, ramesh pokharial nishank, sena pramukh bipin ravat, suraksha salaahkaar ajit dowaal, anil dhasmana sabhi is mitti se jude hai
 Despite this, Pauri is still suffering a tremendous loss of migration, water and education
 saal 2000 main kai andolanon ke baad uttarakhand rajya astitv main aayaa jiske baad yahaan ke logon main ye ummid jaagi ki ab nishchit taur par puure rajya kaa vikaas hoga, logon ke paas rojgaar hoga, acchhee shiksha hogi or acchhee swasthya sevaayen bhi milengi
 All of this will make his life extremely good
 lekin unki ummiido ko tab dhakka lag gaya jab puure pradesh main berogari, shiksha kii kami or karaab swasthya sevaaon kaa bolbalaa hone laga or aakhirkaar logon ne apane puraane gaanv ko chhodkar palaayan karnaa shuru kar diya
 Pauri is the district in Uttarakhand where the maximum migration occurred
 cese study-1'ajtak' kii team ne sabase pehle paudi ke banekh gaavan kaa jayja liya
 In this village facing migration, there is a shortage of drinking water
 boond-boond pani ko tarasate hue log ye kehane se bilkul bhi nahin jhijakte ki netaa jinako vot dekar hamane satta ke shikhar par pahunchaaya wo ab hamen bhul gaye hai
 According to the local people neither they have drinking water nor there are good schools to educate children
 swasth sevaaon kii to baat karnaa hi bemaani he or yahi vajah he kii yahaan se bahut se log palaayan karke puure parivaar ke saath kahin or rahane ko chale gaye
 Water tanks were installed here by the government, but there is no water in it for years
 jisaki chalate sabhi gaanv vaale ek kiraye kii gaadi ke jariye gaanv se 10 kilometre dur se pani bharkar laate hai
 With that water, everyday tasks can be done in some way
 agar ghar main kabhi mehmaan aa jaaen to pani kii killat or bad jaati he
 The conditions here are so bad that water is not available only for bathing and washing but also for drinking
 sthaneey nivasee rajendra singh kii maane to ab sarkaron se unka vishwaas uth gaya he
 After the lack of education and health services, many houses built here are now in ruins
 jinke aabaad hone kii ummid ab nahin bachi he, bas jitna bachaa he utana hi batch jaae vahi bahut he
 The way the villages have been emptied from the people is very sad, where there used to be life, now there is silence there
 makaanon par taale aise lag hai jaise vahaan kabhi koi jivan tha hi nahin
 Case Study 2 After hearing and understanding the problems of Banakh, we moved to Khairsend which is the village of Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat
 siem ravat khud bhi palaayan kar lagbhag 17 saal pehle apane parivaar ke saath dehradun ja chuke hai
 On entering the village, the team met Brijmohan, the elder brother of the Chief Minister and his teacher who had taught the CM till Class 6
 unki shikaayat bhi ek aam naagarik kii tarah hi thi
 He said that due to unemployment, poor education and poor health services, more than 60 percent people have migrated
 kheti tabaahi ke kagaar par he or sunne vaala koi nahin he
 There is only one school in the village but its condition is so bad that now only 80 children come to study there
 bachche ghate to phir shikshakon kii kami kii vajah se shiksha kaa str or girtaa ja rahaa he
 School teacher of Chief Minister Rawat told that till a few years ago there was not so much migration, people used to go through farming here
 ghar or khet donon hi aabaad the lekin ab jahaan kabhi dhan hota tha vahaan ab sirf jhaad-jhakkad hi bachaa he
 There are no people left to do farming in the village
 lekin gaanv waalon ko ab mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat se ummid jarur he
 Perhaps the condition of Khairsend village and Pauri will be improved by his taking over power
 cese study 3kheraa gaanv se chalakar hamaari team yogiadityanath ke ilaake main pahunchi
 There is a tremendous migration here due to lack of basic facilities
 kya bachche, kya mahilaayein, kya bujurg, sabhi ko pani ke liye koson dur chalanaa padataa he
 Seeing the way a long line was found about water in Panchur, it is not difficult to guess what is the real reason for migration
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke pita anand singh bisht kaa bhi yahi kahana he ki palaayan rokane ke liye sabase pehle chakbandi karne kii zarurat he, jab chak banenge to kheti hogi or us par hal chalenge, jisase zamin upjau hogi
 The rainy water that flows will go inside the earth and the dried water sources will start running again
 unka kahana tha ki sarkaar yojanaayen to bahut banaati he lekin vah yojanaayen jameen par kaam karti nahin dikhti hai
 Most of the hilly areas of the country are facing the crisis of migration
 phir bhi kisi sarkaar ne aaj tak is disha main thos tareeke se dharaatal par kaam nahin kiya
 The pain of mountainous areas is as big as the mountain
 18 saal pehle bane is rajya kaa andolan isi baat par ladaa gaya tha ki alag rajya banane se sarkarein yahaan kii moolbhoot suvidhaayen jaise pani, bijli, sadak, shiksha or swasthya sevaaon ko behaal karegi, lekin aisa nahin hua
 However, after so many years of formation of the state, the problem of migration has taken a formidable form
 aaj cricket ke bhagwaan sachin tendulkar kaa janmdin hai
 He is worshiped like a god in cricket
 vishwa cricket main 100 antarrashtriya shatak lagane vaale ekmaatr ballebaaj hai sachin tendulkar
 When Sachin played Tendulkar, it was a different fun to watch his batting
 puri duniya sachin tendulkar ko khelte dekhne or shatak banaate dekhnaa pasand karti thi
 Shane Warne in Sharjah and the Australian team which was done by Sachin Tendulkar are still fresh in the minds of cricket lovers
 vanade cricket ke sabase pehle khilaadi, jinhone 50 over ke khel main doharaa shatak lagaaya ho
 Whether it was ODI cricket or Test or T20 Sachin's bat was spoken everywhere and in every innings, a new history was created
 aaj unheen sachin tendulkar kaa janmdin hai, jinaki duniya mureed hai
 On Sachin's birthday, he is receiving congratulations from all over the world

 Ujjain Simhastha Kumbh also falls in special yoga of zodiac signs and planets
 kumbh kii pavitrataa or mahima kaa bakhaan vedon or puraanon main bhi he
 Learn the characteristics of this great center of faith and the mythology associated with Mahaparva
 
 
 ujjain sinhasth kaa yoga or kumbh ke mahatv :- kumbh kaa aayojan 12 saal main ek baar hota he
 For Ujjain Simhastha, Jupiter in Leo, Sun in Aries and Moon in Libra are considered planet-totals
 is vishesh parv par yahaan shipra nadi main dubkee lagaakar insaan apane paapon se mukti paakar punya kamata he
 - Vishnu Purana has written in the greatness of Kumbh that the result of thousands of baths of Kartik month, hundred baths of Magha or one crore Narmada baths in Vaishakh month, the same result is obtained from a bath of Kumbha festival
 isi prakaar hajaaron ashwamegh yagyon kaa fal yaa sau vaajapeya yagyon kaa fal or puri dharti kii ek lakh parikramaayen karne kaa jo fal miltaa he, vahi fal kumbh ke keval ek snaan kaa hota he
 In this way, the importance of Kumbh is stated in our Vedas, Puranas and Shastras
 - atharvaveda ke anusaar - mahakumbh baarah varsh ke baad aata he, jise ham kai baar prayagadi tirthon main dekha karte hai
 Kumbh is the time when the amazing sum of the planets is seen in the sky
 - yajurveda main bataaya gaya he kikumbhamanushya ko is lok main shaareerik sukh dene vaala or har janm main uttam sukhon ko dene vaala he
 In the Atharvaveda, Brahma has said that, o men! i build four Kumbh festivals to give you worldly pleasures and offer them in four places Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nashik
 vedon or puraanon main bataae gaye mahakumbh ke mahatv ke anusaar kumbh hamaari samskruti kaa amrit mahaparv he jo grah-raashiyon ke yoga se ujjain main shipra ke kinare bhi manaaya jaataa he
 Story of Kumbh - There are many stories regarding the organization of Kumbh
 sabase adhik prachlit manthan katha he
 According to this, the gods and the demons got the nectar urn after churning the sea together
 amrit ko rakshason se bachaane ke liye devataaon ne isaki raksha kaa daayitv brihaspati, chandramaa, surya or shani ko saunpa tha
 When Indra son Jayant, the chief of the gods, ran away with the nectar urn, the demons ran after him
 amrit ko paane ke liye devataaon or daanvon main bhayankar sangram hua
 It is said that this struggle lasted for 12 days
 chunki devataaon kaa ek din manushyon ke ek varsh ke baraabar mana jaataa he to is tarah yah yuddh baarah saalon tak chalaa
 In this war, drops of nectar were spilled in four places on the earth - Haridwar, Prayag, Nashik and Ujjain
 puranic manyata he ki amrit kalash se chhalkin buundon se in chaar sthanon kii nadiyaan - ganga, yamuna, godavari or shipra amritmayi ho gayi
 At the time of spilling amrit drops, the Kumbh festival is organized on those special occasions where there are special yoga opportunities for the position of Sun, Moon and Guru
 is amrit kalash kii raksha main surya, guru or chandramaa ke ne atirikt prayaas kiye
 For this reason, there is a tradition of celebrating Kumbh festival under special conditions of these planets
 katrina caff (katrina Kaif) in dinon 'bharat (bharat)' film ke pramotion main vyast hai
 Katrina Kaif is taking part in all the shows and interviews in connection with the promotion of Bharat film to be released in cinemas on June 5
 isi kadi main katrina (katrina Kaif) pichley dinon neha dhoopiya (neha Dhupia) ke tok sho main najar ain thi
 Here he made a statement related to Janhvi Kapoor, which became synonymous with sensational news
 in khabaron ko dekhte hue sonam kapur (sonam Kaoor) ne ek baar phir se is vivaad par apana rukh saaf kiya
 Sonam Kapoor wrote on her Twitter account that i was not defending Jahnavi Kapoor on Katrina Kaif's comment
 mujhe lagata he yah baat maasoomiyat main kahi gai thi
 On his picture, Sonam wrote that it was a special joke for my sister
 plis ise drama na banaaen
 Guys i wasn't defending janhvi over something my very dear friend Katrina might have innocently said
 It's an inside joke with my sister on her gym looks that get papped
 Pls don't create drama mediawallas
 https: / / t
 co / cjawtofnzb Actually Katrina Kaif expressed concern over the short dress of Jahvvi Kapoor (janhvi Kapoor) during Neha Dhupia's show
 katrina (katrina Kaif) se sawaal poocha gaya ki aisi actress kaa naam bataaie jo gym vier or varking dressop main over da top ho
 In response to this, Katrina Kaif said that she is not over the top but i am cursory about Jhanvi Kapoor's short dress
 katrina ne bataaya jahnavi meri hi gym main aati hai
 Many times i get worried seeing Jahnavi's shorts
 katrina (katrina Kaif) ke is coment ko jahnavi kapur ke kapadon par coment kii tarah le liya gaya
 The controversy escalated when Sonam Kaoor made a comment on her Instagram about Jahnavi Kapoor's dress
 sonam ne ek tasviir share karte hue likhaa ki jahnavi regular kapade bhi pahenti hai or wo rock karti hai
 In the media, when it was said to be the reply given by Sonam Kapoor to Katrina Kaif, she appeared to be avoiding it and targeted the media while clarifying
 One small request, please do not tag my wife in all your funny tweets
 She has better things to look after, although i am over it
 This celebration after series wins against England

 com / f7tymqetae ministry of tourism ke toll free kol centre par ek agyaat shaks dwaara dhamkee bhare kol aane ke baad hadakamp much gaya
 It has threatened a blast at big shrines Badrinath and Vaishno Devi temple
 kol centre kii taharir ke aadhaar par noida police ne cese darj karke is maamle kii jaanch shuru kar di he
 According to the information, the Ministry of Tourism has a toll-free call center in Sector 57 of Noida
 yahaan ek agyaat shaks ne kol karke kaha ki chaaron dham sahit bade dharmik sthalon jaise kedarnath, badrinaath or vaishno devi mandir par bam blast hoga
 He has also spoken in the rally to be held in UP assembly elections
 is dhamkee bhare kol ke aane ke baad kol centre department ne noida ke sector 58 thane main agyaat vyakti ke khilaaf cese darj karaayaa
 Taking the matter seriously, the police has formed a team to investigate the matter
 agyaat shaks kii talaashi ke liye koshish kii ja rahi he
 At the moment there is a police alert
 supremecourt ne sarkari godaamon main anaaj ko sadaane kii bajaay use garibon ko muft baantne sambandhi apni tippanee par kendriya krishi mantri sharad pavaar ke vaktavy ko mangalvaar ko katate hue kaha ki usne iskaa aadesh diya tha na ki suzav jaisaa ki krishi mantri bataanaa chaahate hai
 On the other hand, RJD President and former Railway Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav has said on the matter of Sharad Pawar that either he should not distribute the grains for free or he should resign
 maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi peeth ne mangalvaar ko sarkari vakil se kaha ki yah suzav nahin tha
 We did this order
 mantri ko yah baat bataa den
 a bench of Justices Dalveer Bhandari and Justice Deepak Verma made the latest remarks in the context of newspaper reports in which Pawar said the court had not given any order in the case
 nyaayalay ne spasht kiya ki usne aadesh hi diya tha
 Pawar had said that it is not possible to implement the Supreme Court's suggestion (free distribution of food grains)
 nyaayalay ne aadesh diya ki sarkaar bipiel, apiel or antyoday ann yojana ke paatr pariwaron kaa 2010 ke aankadon ke aadhaar par survey karaae
 The court said that governments cannot grant such exemption on the basis of ten years old data
 nyaayalay ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar ko anaaj kii hifaazat ke liye anivaary rup se kadam uthaanaa chahie taaki yah sadane na paae
 The bench also said that the government should purchase as many grains as it can protect
 supremecourt ne apane us pichley aadesh ko doharaaya jisamen kaha gaya he ki garibi kii rekha se upar ke pariwaron ko sabsidi kaa khadyann nahin diya ja saktaa
 But if the government is bent on giving this benefit to them, then this benefit can be given only to families below the income of three lakh rupees per annum

 lekin hamaare skool ke saare bachche apane shikshakon se bhi zyada us kuen se darate the kyonki prarthana ke samay bahut saare sawaal achaanak kisi bachche se kar diya jaataa tha, agar koi us sawaal kaa jawaab dene main fail ho jaae to uskaa pair pakadakar use kuen main gira dene kii dhamkee di jaati thi
 We had a teacher who was notorious throughout the school for beating the children with a well
 ek din meri bhi baari aayi, main us din jitani dari thi utana dar kabhi nahin laga
 i started crying loudly saying 'mummy-mummy'
 lekin durbhagyavash mere bhi taange pakadakar kuen ke paas le jaaya gaya
 The net was removed and frightened by that darkness of the well
 iske baad dhamkee bhi di gai ki agali baar jarur gira duungaa
 i came back to class silently with fearful prayer
 kitaab liya or skool se bhaag gai lekin ghar nahin gai
 She went to her aunt's house and started playing with other siblings there
 maine do-teen din tak yahi tarika apanaaya
 Rose used to leave for school but did not attend school
 tab phone kaa jamaana bhi nahin tha ki mausi phone karke mummy yaa papa ko bataa de
 The warts did not live in the village, the aunt did not leave the house
 tisare yaa chauthe din mere papa ko kisi shikshak ne puch liya 'neha kii tabiyat kharaab to nahin ho gai he, vah skool nahin aa rahi he'? papa ne mujhe uske baad khojna shuru kiya main unhen nahin mili
 In the evening, according to my scheduled school time, i returned home
 papa ne poocha ki skool main aaj kya-kya padhai hui, maine kuch rati-ratai chijen bataani shuru kii
 Only after speaking two or three words, there was a slap on the cheek
 wo to mummy bachaane aa gai nahin to or zyada pitayee hoti
 The next day, Dad himself left me for school
 main class main chup-chaap rahane lagi thi, jo mere swabhaav ke khilaaf tha
 i did not feel like studying at all
 copy-kitaaben har cheez mujhe fadkar phenk dene kaa man karata tha
 At the same time, the soldier who took care of the children in our school (another teacher, he was famous by the same name in the village) understood my position
 shaam main skool main chuttee hone ke baad wo mere paas aae or bole 'chalo mere saath tumhaare liye kuch laayaa hum'
 i suddenly felt very happy
 gai to dekha ki mere pasand kii dher sari chijen wo laae hue the
 He went to the well with all those things
 mujhe phir se dar lagane laga
 He asked me to peek into the well and said, "don't be afraid, remember," The teacher never pushes into the well, the teacher who will push the children in the well will not be a teacher
 maine skool ke diarector se baat kar lee he, usne us shikshak ko danta he
 Now no child will be intimidated by the well
 ' main bahut khush hui dobaaraa meraa man padhai main lagane laga tha
 Throughout the school, he was a man who was a true teacher
 bhale hi wo 'duusari kaksha' tak ke bacchon ko hi padhaa pate the, magar aisa padhaate the ki unka padhaayaa koi kabhi na bhuule
 Therefore, he was the beloved teacher of all the children of our school
 lekin skool main unhen zyaadaatar shikshak ek chaparasi kii najar se dekhte the, kyonki wo bacchon ko pani tak pilaayaa karte the
 Today, the children studying with me may not remember the names of their teachers, but the soldier will definitely remember them
 unke adarsh meri padhai kii tarah aaj bhi mere saath hai

 An Indian think tank can also participate in this
 china ke raashtrapati shi jinping 'van belt, van root' pariyojna yani new silk rodpariyojna shikhar sammelan main iskaa agenda pesh karenge
 It is also known as New Silk Road Project
 chini raashtrapati shi jinping ne aarthik mandi se jujh rahi apni arthvyavastha main jaan foonkane or usamen teji laane ke liye 'van belt, van root' kaa idia pesh kiya he
 China 65 countries in the world and 4
 4 arab jansankhya ko laalach dekar isamen fansaa rahaa he
 Dragon says that under the 'one Belt, One Route' project, there will be huge investment in these countries and the infrastructure will be strengthened
 iske alaava in deshon ke logon kii mali haalat main sudhaar hoga or rojgaar ke avasar badhenge
 However, China is refraining from disclosing the benefits to itself
 ise bhi padhieh 'van belt van road' par summit se pehle modi ke srilankai daure se china main khalabaliaarthik vikaas ke naam par kas rahaa shikanjadragon tark de rahaa he ki uski 'van belt, van root' pariyojna se duniya ke deshon ke bich aarthik sahyog badhegaa or vaishvik mandi ke asar se nipten main madad milegi
 However, countries like India and America are understanding this flattery
 agar ham china ke videshi nivesh par najar daudaayen, to ab tak uskaa sabase kharaab record rahaa he
 Now the Chinese government has resorted to the New Silk Road to help its country recover from the economic downturn and to tackle the problem of unemployment
 iske jariye vah 65 deshon main sidhe nivesh kar sakegaa yani in deshon kii arthvyavastha par china kaa sidhaa dakhal hoga, jiske baad vah inako apane ishaare par nachaata rahegaa
 In such a situation, India is very concerned about the involvement of its neighbors in the New Silk Road
 bharat ko bhi shaamil karne kii koshish main chinachin bharat ko bhi 'van belt, van root' pariyojna main shaamil karne kii purajor koshish kar rahaa he
 He is also deeply concerned with India's growing economy
 vahiin, bharat apane padosi deshon ke new silk rodpariyojna main shaamil hone se behad chintit he
 He fears that his neighbors will fall under China's control by falling into this trap
 saath hi china bharat ko chaaro ore se gherne kii yojana main kaamyaab ho jayega
 At the same time, Pakistan has allocated about 160 billion rupees for this project
 vaishvik bazaar kaa sabase bada khilaadi ban jayega chinachin is pariyojna ke jariye vaishvik bazaar kaa sabase bada khilaadi bananaa chahta he
 There is another interest of China hidden behind it
 haal hi main vishwa main chini vastuon kii maang main baari giravat ai he
 This leads to China looking to market to sell its goods
 chini saamaanon kii supplai kam hone se vahaan maujuuda samay main berogari kaa str bhi kaaphi badha he, jo china ke liye sirdard bana hua he
 Recently many Chinese companies have had to lay off crores of employees
 aise main china is pariyojna ke jariye vaishvik bazaar main apana varchasv kaayam karnaa chahta he, jahaan vah apane over production ko aasaani se supplai kar sakegaa
 The US is also concerned by this project of China
 vah china kii is pariyojna kii kaat nahin dhundh paa rahaa he

 Yeddyurappa told reporters that he has come to Mumbai to congratulate party president Nitin Gadkari on becoming the president for the second consecutive time
 unhone kaha, main gadakari ji ko dobaaraa adhyaksh banane par badhai dene ke liye mumbai ja rahaa hum
 He has been standing with me like a rock in every situation
 isliye main unase avashya mulaakaat karuunga
 However, he also expressed his unhappiness over other senior leaders of the party, Anant Kumar and said that he would work to strengthen the BJP in the state
 purv mukhyamantri ne kaha, main party ko pichley kuch dinon kii ghatnaon ke vishay main avgat karaungaa
 i will work to strengthen the party in the state
 bhrashtachar ke aaropon par mukhyamantri pad ganvaane ke baad yediurppa evam party ke sheersh netritv ke madhya sambandhon main tanaav chal rahaa he
 Yeddyurappa is also estranged from the current Chief Minister of the state and his successor Sadanand Gowda, whom he himself had selected
 tippaniyan Earlier on Thursday, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, showing his strength, forced his arch-rival Sanjay Joshi to resign from the party's national executive membership
 party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak shuru hone se pehle joshi ke istife ko modi ko shant rakhane ke bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke prayaas ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 Joshi's resignation cleared the way for Modi's presence at the meeting
 modi or joshi ek duusare ke virdohi rahe hai or joshi ko kaaryakarini main shaamil karne kaa gadakari ke haalia faisle se gujarat ke mukhyamantri kaaphi naaraaz chal rahe the
 Modi had threatened that if Joshi was present during the meeting, he would not take part in it
 kaaryakarini main joshi ko waapas laane vaale gadakari ne chote se vivaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa kii or elaan kiya ki vah or modi party kii majbootee ke liye kaam karenge
 He said, i am going to Mumbai to congratulate Gadkari on becoming the president again

 Modi and Joshi have been opposed to each other and Gadkari's recent decision to induct Joshi in the executive was angered by the Chief Minister of Gujarat

 On the last day of the Gujarat election campaign, on behalf of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi held a press conference and made many serious allegations against the BJP and the Modi government
 unhone kaha ki pichley 20 saalon se gujarat ke log vikaas kii raah dekh rahe hai, or sarkaar ne keval logon ko gumraah kiya he
 Rahul also did not delay in answering these allegations and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also gave a press conference to answer Rahul's questions
 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki rahul gandhi kevalgalat bayaanbajikar rahe hai, unhen gujarat main vikaas najar nahin aa rahaa he, kyonki congress sarkaar ne vikaas ke naam par 10 saal tak desh ko lutaa he
 Rahul forgot that corruption had become the hallmark of his government
 rahul ko jawaab dete hue kendriya mantri ne kaha ki gujarat main ghar-ghar mandir jane se nahin, bijepi sarkaar kii mehnat se ai he

 According to the BJP, during the entire election campaign in Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi resorted to lies and even today he lied in the press conference
 rahul ko pataa hona chahie ki doodh utpaada main gujarat aage he or ye jhooth bolne se nahin, mehnat kii kamai he
 He said, 'we wonder who gives figures to Rahul Gandhi, because there is no truth in those figures
 'rahul kaa piem par joardaar hamalagauratlab he ki isse pehle rahul ne bijepi par pisi main joardaar hamalaa kiya
 Rahul said, '33 thousand crores were given to Tata Nano factory, not even a car appeared
 bijli pani sab free diya gaya, par janata ko kuch nahin diya gaya
 BJP started with Narmada, talked about OBC, Vikas Yatra but BJP could not maintain its position
 piem apni aakhri meeting main congress yaa apni baat kar rahe hai'
 Now Modi does not talk about corruption
 Apart from this, Rahul Gandhi said that earlier Modi ji used to talk about corruption, Jai Shah's case came, Rafael deal came out
 ab nahin bolte
 No longer talk about farmers
