 pakistan ke saath bharat ke rishton kaa yah pench shuukravaar ko bilkul saaf dhang se khulaa
 However, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in Delhi, India will not fire the first shot
 rajnath ne pakistan rangers ko samajhaayaa ki pakistan apni taraf se ho rahi ghuspaith roke or ghuspaith se aagaah karne ke liye aatishi roshni kaa istemaal kare
 One soldier should not fire at another
 pakistan ke major general umr faruk burki ne kaha, ve apni hukumat tak yah paigaam pahunchaa denge

 An encounter with militants was going on in Handwara, North Kashmir, 900 km from the place of this pleasant conversation, in which two soldiers were killed

 The old trend of talk and confrontation from Delhi to Handwara is seen again
 biguef or paak rangers ke liye asli chunauti isi chalan ke paar jaakar kuch thos upaay karne kii he taaki ghuspaith or aatank kaa yah silsilaa ruke, aapasi bharosa bade
 Pakistan admitted that many times there were deaths due to omissions on both sides

 The Home Minister also taught spiritual lessons to Pakistan and said that India is more 'islamic' than Pakistan
 yahaan 72 phirka hai

 utaran serial se pahchaan banane vaali popular tivi sho dian kii lead actress tina datta ne do maheene pehle apane ko-star mohit malhotra par gambhir aarope lagaate hue kaha tha ki mohit ne shooting ke dauraan unhen galat tareeke se chune kii koshish kii he
 While the actor had denied the allegations
 lekin ek baar phir apni ko-star ko galat tareeke se chune kii khabaron ko lekar mohit malhotra surkhiyon main bane hue hai
 According to reports, after Tina, now the witch's second actress Priya Bathija has accused Mohit of touching her wrongly
 bataa den, priya kuch maheene pehle hi dian sho kaa hissaa bani hai
 According to the report, Priya accused Mohit that the things that Tina had to face because of co-star Mohit are also going through the same circumstances
 intimet seens karte samay mohit apni hadein paar karne lagate hai
 It is also reported that Priya created a lot of ruckus on the sets due to this behavior of Mohit and she cried herself in a vanity van
 mohit ke saath kaam karne se bhi manaa kar diya tha
 After this Mohit also apologized for his behavior
 lekin priya ne is khabar ko maanane se saaf inkaar kar diya he
 According to Priya, this news is false
 pinkavila ko die ek intervyuu main priya ne kaha, yah puri tarah se jhooth he
 i am not the kind of person who cried herself in a vanity van
 agar mohit ne mujhe galat tareeke se chuaa hota, to main uske thappad laga chuki hoti
 But there is no truth in this matter
 'unhone aage kaha, 'main to pichley 10-12 din se shooting bhi nahin kar rahi hum
 i started shooting just a day ago and today i am listening to this news
 mujhe nahin pataa yah sab koun kar rahaa he, lekin mai bataa duun ki main mohit or uske bhai ko pehle se jaanati hum or hamaare bich acha rishta he
 i don't even talk on set too much
 'bataa den, dian kii shooting ke dauraan tina ko kai baar rote hue dekha ja chukaa he or kai baar unhone sho ke produsar se mohit kii shikaayat bhi kii thi
 Tina had told in her interview that the show's makers have Warne Mohit several times due to his misbehavior
 lekin baavjood iske mohit ke vyavhaar main koi badlaav nahin aayaa
 But after some time, Tina Dutta and Mohit ended their disputes and extended friendship towards each other
 isapar jaankaree dete hue tina ne kaha tha, "mohit or maine matbhedon ko sulajhaa liya he
 We have decided to start afresh
 mujhe unke saath kaam karne main koi dikkat nahin he
 Our onscreen chemistry works for the show and we want to maintain a professional atmosphere for the betterment of the show

 Or a political convention
 par kuch apwaadon ko chhod aisa hota aayaa he
 Even if big leaders roam around the country and make sharp and fierce attacks on each other, they do not go to campaign in each other's constituencies
 rahul gandhi ke chunaav kshetra amethi main narendra modi kii raily ek aisa hi apwaad he
 The BJP made a very deliberate decision to hold Modi's rally in Amethi
 party main ise lekar ek raay nahin he
 Many big leaders are against breaking that undisclosed agreement or convention
 yahaan tak ki modi ko chhod koi doosraa bada netaa vahaan party kaa prachaar karne nahin gaya he
 The decision to hold Modi's rally in Amethi is being considered by the party's general secretary and UP in-charge Amit Shah
 darasal, shah kaa maananaa tha ki smriti irani ke rup main bijepi amethi main rahul gandhi ko kadi takkar detii dikh rahi he
 In Amethi, which has become the stronghold of the gandhi-nehru family, the BJP has won the election in the past
 congress se bijepi main aae sanjay singh ne 1998 main ye seat jiti thi
 However, Sonia or Rahul were not in the contest then
 1999 main sonia gandhi yahaan se ladiin or jeetin
 In 2004, she moved to the nearby Rae Bareli seat and Rahul Gandhi fought from here and has been an MP since then
 modi kii amethi main raily karaane ke peeche soch ye he ki bijepi puure rajya main ladaai main dikhni chahie
 The party did not want to give a walkover to Amethi like Rae Bareli
 amethi main smriti irani jaisaa majboot ummidavaar utaarne ke peeche bhi yahi soch thi
 In Rae Bareli, the party was looking to field Uma Bharti as against Sonia Gandhi
 lekin aisa nahin ho sakaa
 There is no doubt that amethi-rae Bareli is being identified with the Gandhi family all over the country
 sthaneey logon ko is baat kaa garv he
 While the workers of the opposition parties are satisfied that at least they ask for the same excuse
 ye zarur he ki chaahe amethi or raibareli viipi siten hon, lekin uttar pradesh ke anya chunaav kshetron kii hi tarah vahaan bhi tamaam tarah ke sthaneey mudde haaavee rahete hai
 The people of Amethi and Rae Bareli, who are craving basic facilities like electricity, roads and water, have also given up hope that sonia-rahul will pay more attention to these issues
 lekin narendra modi ke amethi main chunaav prachaar karne se vahaan chunaav kaa nateeja badal jayega, isaki sambhaavna behad kam he
 The purpose of Modi's campaigning in Rahul's constituency seems to show that BJP is taking this fight very seriously
 koi hairaani nahin he ki log ab poochne lage hai ki amethi main kya hoga? jabaki vahaan ke chunaav parinaam main kisi bade ulat-pher kii baat koi nahin karata he
 The important thing is that Priyanka Gandhi has directly attacked Modi by camping in Amethi and Rae Bareli and forced him to respond
 kareeb dedh hafte se media main priyanka sidhe modi se takkar leti dikh rahi hai jabaki rahul-sonia peeche chhot gaye
 The question is, how will the Congress answer this? In Banaras, Priyanka has denied any publicity in support of Congress candidate Ajay Rai
 bich main khabar ai thi ki shaayad priyanka kaashi vishwanath kaa darshan karne ke bahaane hi banaras kaa daura kar len, lekin iskaa bhi khandan kar diya gaya
 Congress strategists are also denying that there will be an election meeting of either Sonia or Rahul in Benaras
 ye zarur he ki banaras main ajay raay ke liye ranneeti banane kaa jimmaa congress ke behad sulajhe hue netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ko de diya gaya he
 But all these things have happened when Modi's program of electoral meeting in Amethi was not made
 ab badale halaat main shaayad congress bhi apni ranneeti par dobaaraa soche or rahul yaa sonia ko banaras main chunaav prachaar ke liye utaare
 In 1984, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was defeated by Madhav Rao Scindia
 bijepi samet tamaam vipakshi dalon ke diggaj haar gaye the
 There was no strong opposition leader left to speak against the Congress in the Lok Sabha
 shaayad isi se sabak lekar ye aghoshit samjhauta yaa paripati bani ho ki kuch bade netaaon kaa loksabhaa main hona loktantr ke liye bhi zaruri he
 However, in 1999, Sushma Swaraj came out against Sonia Gandhi in Bellary
 lekin bade raajnneetik virdohi ke chunaav kshetra main prachaar na karne kii parampara kaayam bani rahi
 This time she is also broken
 desh kii maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantrihone ke baavjood bhi smriti irani ko apane bacchon ke admician ke liye skool jaakar intervyuu dena padaa
 In this regard, Smriti Irani said that i had to give interview as a parent to get my children admitted to school in Delhi
 is intervyuu main skool ke teachers or principal ne mujhase or mere bacchon se sawaal puche
 Smriti Irani said that i believe that if i am a minister, the rules should not be ignored just for this reason
 yah ek jimmedaari he, jiskaa galat istemaal nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Smriti told that for a few days after the shift from Mumbai to Delhi, i had a lot of trouble to keep the coordination between home and office, after which we decided to shift from Mumbai to Delhi
 smriti ne kaha ki mere parivaar ke liye yah nayaa anubhav he
 He has been in Mumbai since the beginning, in such a situation he has faced some difficulties in moving to Delhi
 dilli shift hote hi bacchon ke daakhile ke liye mujhe, mere pati jubin or mere bacchon ko skool jaakar intervyuu dena padaa

 After 24 years, forgetting all their differences for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, when Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) announced the alliance, the question was asked why Congress is not in this alliance
 Taking cover of this mystery, former UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has said that Congress was kept out of the coalition to correct electoral arithmetic
 espi adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke ishaaron main die gaye is jawaab ko upi kii siyaasi ganit ke taraazoo main taul kar dekhen to yah spasht ho jayega ki unhone aisa kyon kaha?saal 2014 ke aam chunaav main 30 saal baad yadi kisi dal ko loksabhaa main bahumat mila to iskaa kaaran yah tha bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne upi kii kul 80 siton main se 71 siton par jeet kaa paracham laharaaya or endie ko 73 siten milin
 In these elections, SP, BSP and Congress fought alone and BJP benefited from a multi-cornered contest
 lekin aaj ke siyaasi halaat juda hai, kabhi ek-duusare ke dhur virdohi rahe espi-bispi ne bijepi ke rath ko rokane ke liye haath mila liya he
 According to this agreement, BSP will contest 38 seats and SP in 37 seats
 jabaki ajit singh ke rashtriya lokdal (areldi) ke liye 3 siten chodi gai hai
 So there are seats of Rae Bareli and Amethi left for the Congress
 2017 vidhansabha chunaav main thik nahin tha ankaganikhilesh yadav ne ek samachar agency ko die intervyuu main kaha ki apane kaarykaal main tamaam vikaas kaaryon ke baavjood ham vidhansabha chunaav haar gaye, kyonki chunavi ankaganit thik nahin tha
 So we corrected arithmetic by taking BSP and RLD together and leaving 2 seats for Congress
 bataa den ki upi vidhansabha chunaav main espi ne congress ke saath gathbandhan kiya tha
 The performance of both parties in this alliance was extremely poor
 isse pehle bispi bhi congress ke saath 1996 main gathbandhan kar chunaav lard chuki he
 The Congress got the BSP vote in these elections but the Congress vote was not transferred to the BSP
 darasal upi main kamjor ho chuki congress kaa prabhaav kuch shahari hisson or agadi jati tak simit ho chukaa he
 This is the population that votes against the SP-BSP
 lihaaja in donon dalon se congress ke gathbandhan kii surat main yah vot bijepi (jahaan congress kaa ummidavaar nahin he) ko chalaa jaataa he
 Whereas the SP-BSP-RLD in the recently held Kairana, Phulpur and Gorakhpur by-elections have seen that their votes get to each other's candidates
 aise main congress kii bhoomika vot katwa se zyada nahin rah jaati, jo atat: in donon dalon ko hi phayda pahunchaayegi
 BJP will not get the opportunity for religious polarization: With all the opposition parties of Uttar Pradesh coming together, it will be easy for the BJP to campaign that all the parties have gathered to defeat it
 bijepi pehle se hi espi or congress ko muslimon kii party bataati rahi he
 In such a situation, the plan of polarization of votes by BJP would have been successful, which would have benefited the BJP itself
 lekin ab yah saaf he ki congress jahaan bhi ladegi bijepi kaa hi vot kaategi, na ki gathbandhan kaa
 Congress does not have any caste votebank One reason for keeping Congress out of this alliance is that it does not have any special caste votebank
 jabaki espi ke paas yadav-muslim, bispi ke paas dalit-muslim or ajit singh kaa pashchim uttar pradesh ke jat vot par prabhaav he
 Congress supporters are mostly upper caste and urban middle class, which can be called floating vote
 yah vot congress ke vikalp ke taur par bijepi ko to ja saktaa he, lekin espi-bispi ko nahin jaataa
 The Congress will also get a chance to contest more seats; If the Congress joins the SP-BSP-RLD mini coalition, it will not get as many seats as it wanted to contest, given its strength in the state
 gathbandhan ne raibareli or amethi kii 2 seat dekar yah sabit kar diya
 But now Congress can contest more seats
 yah paristhiti congress or gathbandhan donon ke liye mufeed he
 Because the coalition would like the Congress to cut the bjp's vote in as many seats as possible
 jabaki hindi pattee ke 3 rajyon main mili jeet se congress utsahit he or hindi pattee ke sabase bade rajya upi main apni vaapasi ko betaab bhi
 In such a state, where the top leadership of the Congress has been contesting elections, the party will not want to show itself as inferior

 com / euix7wwea0 bharat or australia ke bich maujuuda series main donon tiimon ke captain joardaar pradarshan ke chalate lambey samay tak yaad kiye jaaenge
 For the first time in Test history, captains have scored seven centuries in a series
 captain ke taur par viraat kohli ne is series main teen shatak jamaaye, vahiin duusari ore se steven smith ke balle se bhi itane hi shatak nikle, jabaki edilade test main captain maaikel clark ne behtareen shatak banaaya
 From this perspective, Virat Kohli and Steven Smith were the heroes of this series
 in donon ko pehali baar test main captaini kaa mauka mila or donon ne dikhaaya ki captaini ke dabaav main unka pradarshan kahin nikhar kar saamne aata he
 Steven Smith scored 769 runs in this series with the help of four centuries
 128 se zyada kii ausat se chaar yaa usase kam test maichon kii ek series main vah sabase zyada ran banane vaale australian ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 On the other hand, Virat Kohli scored 692 runs in four innings of four Tests of the series with four centuries
 bharat kii ore se australian maidan par kisi bhi ballebaaz kaa ek series main yah sabase bada score he
 In the first Test of the series in Adelaide, Virat Kohli got the captaincy from Team India and he made history by hitting a strong century in both innings
 kohli kii shatkeey pari kii badaulat team india edilade main aitihaasik jeet ke kareeb pahunch gai thi, haalanki kohli team ko jeet nahin dilaa paae, lekin unhone apane aalochakon kaa bhi dil jeet liya
 Michael Clarke was captaining Australia in the Adelaide Test
 apane dost philiff hus kii maut ke sadame or peeth kii takalif ke baavjood unhone gajab kii himmat dikhaate hue edilade test kii pehali pari main shandaar shatak banaaya
 Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was responsible for Brisbane and Melbourne
 bristben test main captain dhoni balle se kuch khaas nahin kar paae, lekin duusari pari main australia ko jab jeet ke liye mahaj 128 ran banane the, to unhone apane gendbaazon kaa bakhubi istemaal kiya
 Australia's six wickets fell, with three caught by Dhoni
 lekin duusari ore mahaj 25 saal main australia ke captain bane steve smith ne lagaataar duusare test main shatak bana diya
 He scored 162 not out and 52 not out in Adelaide's first Test
 bristben kii pehali pari main captain ke taur par steven smith ne 133 ran banaae, jabaki duusari pari main unhone 28 ranon kaa yogadan diya
 In the Melbourne Test, Steven Smith hit a third century in the third Test in a row
 unhone pehali pari main 192 ran kii joardaar pari kheli
 If Smith had completed a double century, the record of the youngest captain who scored a double century would have been his name
 don breadman ne 1937 main 28 saal or 131 din kii umr main ye record banaaya tha
 Steven Smith was able to score just 14 runs in the second innings of this Test
 is test main bharat ke captain the, mahendra singh dhoni, jinhone najuk maukey par duusari pari main wicket par tik kar bharat ke liye match bachaaya
 During the crucial innings of 24 runs, he became the highest scoring captain in Tests for India
 test main bataur captain dhoni ke naam bharat kii ore se sabase zyada 3454 ran hai
 Not only this, he made five in the first innings behind the wicket and four in the second innings
 isi dauraan wicket ke peeche sabase zyada stamping kaa world record bhi unhone apane naam kar liya
 During this Test, MS Dhoni surprised the cricket world by retiring from the Test
 90 test maichon main 60 test match main dhoni ne captaini kii, bharat kii ore se sabase zyada or sabase zyada test jeet kaa bhartiya record bhi unke naam rahaa
 In the last Test of the series, Steven Smith hit 117 runs in the first innings and 71 runs in the second innings in Sydney
 vahiin bharat kii ore se viraat kohli ne captain ke taur par lagaataar teesri pari main shatak banaakar itihaas bana diya
 He is the only cricketer to reach this milestone
 pehali pari main kohli ne 147 ran or duusari pari main 46 ran banaae
 Steven Smith may have been voted Man of the Series for his strong batting but Virat Kohli's claim was no less than Smith's
 jaahir he ki yah series bataur captain viraat kohli kii pehali series thi, lekin jis tarah se unhone aakraamak or jimmedaari bhare cricket kaa parichay diya he, usase jaahir he ki vah mahendra singh dhoni kii jagah lene ke liye taiyaar kar chuke hai
 After Dhoni in Test matches, a new round of Virat Kohli has started
 jabaki duusari ore maaikel clark ke daavedaar kii bhoomika main steven smith puri tarah feet najar aa rahe hai
 Although both of them lack experience, they are ready to emerge as the most powerful captain of world cricket in the coming time

 People always have different views about Islam in the country, while politics is also fierce on these issues
 haal hi main hyderabad kii raily main saansad asaduddin owesi ne kaha tha ki muslim ilaakon main notebandi ke baad atm or cash main paisa nahin mil rahaa, to siyasat or dharm ke ghalmelvaale vivaad par tivi channelon par bahes shuru ho gai
 This was the sequel to the same disputes, in which the debate on Islam between Bharat Mata Ki Jai's slogan, Suryanamaskar and the issues of triple talaq was discussed
 lekin bharat main islam kii asal tasviir kya he? jo siyaasi reliyon main netaaon kii nazar se dikhti he yaa phir maulavee yaa ulimaon ke zarie yaa isse bhi juda he
 In the current situation this question may seem complicated, but the answer can be easily found, if you have heard the researchers doing research in a seminar in Jamia Milia Islamia, then these scholars of Islam discussed different topics, But Amrai was seen about one thing and that is, look at the picture of Islam by separating it from politics in India and also feel the difference
 fark itnaa he ki siyaasi nazar vaale islam ko jor se bolkar or shor machaakar siyaasi log bataate hai or research ke nichod par band kamare main bahes hoti he lekin vidambnaa dekhie ki band kamare main hui bahes main islam kii paribhaasha jitani vishaal, gahari or failaav liye hue he, khule aasmaan ke neeche hone vaali siyaasi bahason main use utana hi sankuchit bana diya jaataa he
 These days, scholars at Jamia University's India Arab Center are engaged with universities across the country, the aim is to discuss the political, social and cultural aspects of Islam in India
 koshish he ki iske zarie bharat main islam ke tamaam ayaamon ko vaastavik arthon main samajhane or maujuuda halaat main use dekhne kaa he
 Director of India Arab Center, Dr
 emech eliyaaz ne tamaam scolers ke saamne seminar ke makasad ko rakhaa or iske baad ek ek karke tamaam vidwaanon ne maujuuda vakt main samakaleen islam ke vaastavik vishleshan se lekar muslimon ke anya dharmon ke saath sambandhon tak kii charchaa or bahes hui
 Talking in the seminar reached to the Mughals through Sufi thought in Toislam, in this seminar, the research scholars of Jamia including Jammu and Kashmir, Aligarh Muslim University and DU presented their research
 seminar ke samanvayak dow
 Nasir Raza Khan said that the research of Islam in India now needs to be removed from the closed room, so now more scholars are working on Indian aspects of Islam, so that common people also develop an understanding of untouched aspects of Islam in India

 Why? Because so much technology has come in your life, which is becoming very dangerous to handle
 10 lakh log har maheene naukari karnaa chaahate hai lekin automation ise chunauti de rahaa he
 In the next 6 months to 8 months people are changing their businesses
 ye baaten kahin innovations par likhane vaale lekhak pranjal sharma ne
 Pranjal was speaking in Business Today's Rethinking the Future session
 bharat main automation ho rahaa he lekin desh ko ye pataa nahin ki ise kaise sambhala jaae
 Why we need automation kyonki, ye darty, dangeras, dal or dificult he
 But people are doing such jobs or business
 kyonki unhen maheene ke ant main paise chahie hote hai
 Dirty means cleaning the river
 dangeras yani manual scanvenging
 Dal is a job where people are just doing jobs
 dificult yani koi bhi kaam jisamen mushkilen zyada ho
 The government is using automation
 As soon as the name of automation comes, a picture of robots talking in people's minds comes
 inakam tex filing main bahut zyada automation ho chukaa he
 Automation is happening in government departments
 bal kalyaan mantri to gaayab bacchon kii khoj ke liye automation kaa upyog kar rahi hai
 The Department of Transportation is also doing automation
 kuch din baad driving license ke liye aapako ghoose dena nahin hoga
 You will have an automated test and the machine will not take a bribe
 hamen har saal, do saal main lagaataar badalanaa hogakaise automation ke saath jiya jaae
 When is our mobile updated? teen yaa chah maheene main lekin ham 30 saal ke liye ek degree lekar apadet ho jate hai
 Whoever we are, we have to upgrade a few days later
 agar nahin honge to ham barbaad ho jaaenge
 We are living in a world where we are constantly doing something in the screen
 desh or sarkaar data ke maamle main ab bhi garib hekuch din baad mobile main hi pos (point Of Sale - POS) mashin hogi
 We have to upgrade every six months
 bharat sarkaar data processing main behad garib desh he
 Because many government people do not know how their data is processed
 desh or sarkaar ko ye pataa nahin hota ki data kahaan he

 ) The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Friday supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi as a strong leader on the basis of performance in Gujarat

 We are proud of him as our worker

 Hosbole said that we will consider various national issues including economic policy, national security, education, health and environment

 According to Iyer, this kind of politics of changing colors repeatedly is non-essential
 darasal, congress pravaktaa shashi tharur ne kaha tha ki Prime Minister Narendra Modi was once considered a symbol of hatred, but now he has transformed his personality into an avatar of modernity and progress
 shashi tharur ne yah bhi kaha he ki congress agar modi ke udaar or sabko saath lekar chalane vaali pahal ke prati rukha ravaiya akhriyaar karti he to yah shishtachar nahin mana jayega

 isamen nae rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah kii tajposhi par muhar lagani he
 The hoardings in the middle of the big two screens draw attention which is a sign of an era of change in BJP
 isamen bain taraf atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani kii tasviir ke neeche likhaa he—ek bharat, to dayee taraf shah or pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tasviir ke neeche likhaa he—shreshth bharat
 The message is clear that the BJP has now entered the modi-shah era
 hordings par likhi ibaarat yah bhi bataa rahi thi ki rashtriya parishad kii muhar to mahaj aupchaarikta thi
 Behind Shah's coronation, his unexpected success in Uttar Pradesh as general secretary in the Lok Sabha elections is being described as a yardstick
 lekin tathy yah he ki modi ne loksabhaa chunaav ke nateezon se pehle hi shah ko bijepi adhyaksh banavaane kii kavayad shuru kar saaf sanket de die the ki party ke liye unka najariya kaisaa he
 Modi has disclosed this view with his style of speeches and work
 ab usee nazariye se shah party ko nai shakl dene kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 He has prepared a long-term blueprint for radical changes in the party
 vaise, ek myne main modi or shah kaa rashtriya raajnneeti main avataran ek jaisaa he
 Modi has never been a Member of Parliament before and was elected for the first time and occupied the Prime Minister's chair, Shah, who has never been the President of the state, has now become the emperor of the BJP
 beshak, ab shah se party sanghathan main badlaav or party ko nae kshetron main prasar ke maamle main bhi uttar pradesh jaisi safalataa dikhaane kii ummid hogi
 Apparently this gave him national recognition and he reached the pinnacle in the BJP
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 9 agast kii rashtriya parishad kii baithak main shah ko main of da match kaa tamgaa dete hue kaha, “agar amit uttar pradesh nahin aate to unki kshamta kaa pataa desh ko nahin chalata
 However, Shah is facing trial for Sohrabuddin fake encounter and was also jailed in 2010 in the same case
 teen maheene baad mili jamaanat or uske saath gujarat se baahar rahane kii adalati shart unke nijee jivan ke liye kathin bhale rahi, lekin rajnatik kariyar ke liye mufeed sabit hui
 Shah himself recounts his success story in a personal conversation with trusted people at the national level, "when i was forced to stay out of Gujarat for two years, i used those moments to build my network while living in Delhi
 
 is dauraan main kabhi lakhanu to kabhi desh ke anya rajyon main ghumta rahaa or us samay mere kaaphi dost bane
 The information network made up of those same friends helped me in the Lok Sabha elections
 us mushkil ghadi main bane doston main se hi maine kuch logon ko chhanta or nijee taur par unka sahyog liya
 "now bjp's head, Shah has set a strategy to work on a 20-year long-term plan, laying the foundation for change
" badalegi sanghathan kii kaaryshalepani dirghakaalik ranneeti ke tahat shah kii praathamiktaaon main sanghathan ko prabhavi bananaa or party-sarkaar ke bich saamanjasy bithaana he
 The president-era era that is easily accessible from the vajpayee-advani era to Rajnath Singh is about to end
 shah kaa mizaaj apane purvavartiyon se alag he
 According to a senior leader close to him, "he is a man away from the crowd who does not like court politics
 ve thos aankadon ke saath jameen par kaam karne waalon ko tarjeeh dete hai
 "the 49-year-old Shah is also preparing to bring people below his age to his team
 uttar pradesh main loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan unke saath sah prabharee kii bhoomika nibhaa chuke or ab rajya ke sanghathan mantri sunil bansal ko unhone mishan-20 saal kaa mantra diya he
 The state organization has been advised to work on a plan to bring the maximum age of office-bearers up to 40 years so that a political plan for the next 20 years can be worked out
 sangh or bijepi par nigaah rakhane vaale varisht patrkaar or vishleshak ram bahadur raay bataate hai, “shah kii khaasiyat he jo bhi vyakti unke saamne aata he, uske bare main do-teen minute main yah anumaan laga lete hai ki vyakti sanghathan ke kaam kaa he yaa sansadeey raajnneeti kaa
 Rai admits, "shah will give priority to the organization
 atal yug main sangh se aane vaale sanghathan mantri kaa pad isliye khatm kar diya gaya tha kyonki ve adhyakshon par haaavee rahete the
 But now Shah is restoring him
 ”shah kii najar upi vidhansabha main bhi bijepi kaa paracham lahraane kii he
 How clear is Shah's thinking about UP, a senior leader explains, "shah had said in private conversations with some party leaders during the election campaign," Not a single Muslim from UP will win
 ” iskaa aadhaar jatigat-saamaajik sameekaran kaa majboot khaakaa tha, jiske aadhaar par tikat die gaye the
 According to sources, Shah also plans to create new leadership before 2017 by bringing some faces from the most backward and Dalit class
 isliye upi main khaas taur se un netaaon par nakel kasne kii bhi taiyaari ho chuki he jo dilli jaakar netaaon kii chapalusee yaa shikawa-shikaayat karte rahete hai
 In the recently concluded National Council meeting, the party received reports of 97 local leaders who were not members of the council
 lekin cheharaa dikhaane ke liye farji tareeke se parishad kii baithak main shaamil ho gaye the
 a new chapter in the sangh-bjp relationship: The nda's defeat in the 2004 elections and then the Jinnah episode of LK Advani in 2005, the sangh-bjp relationship has been sour
 lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii jeet ke baad rishton kaa nayaa adhyay shuru ho chukaa he
 The Sangh was hesitant about both Shah and Modi coming from Gujarat, but keeping in mind the experiences of the Vajpayee government, the Sangh gave the green signal
 sangh se jude ek varisht netaa bataate hai ki aakhri nirnay ke liye jab sangh ke sheersh netaaon kii toli baithi to unki raay bani, “party or sarkaar kaa ek hi centre rahanaa chahie
 Modi should be given a free hand so that there would be no later stage of complaining that he was not allowed to do what he wanted to do
 ”amit shah kii team se sangh-bijepi ke nae rishton kii jhlak dikhegi
 The presence of Ram Madhav, a member of the Sangh executive, and Ram Madhav, the pracharak Shivprakash, and the presence of Ram Madhav in every major meeting without any formal responsibility point towards better coordination
 unhen mahasachiv yaa upaadhyaksh banaakar sarkaar-party main samanvay kii jimmedaari di ja sakati he
 According to sources, this time the organization will have five to six co-organization ministers in addition to the organization general secretary
 do-teen anya prachaarak dakshin bharat se laane kii taiyaari he
 For the first time, a BJP president's team will comprise at least seven pracharaks from the Sangh
 rishton main samanvay kii hi misaal he ki jiem fasal or beemaa, shram sudhaar jaise masalon par sangh ke anushanbik sanghathanon ke kuch netaaon ne modi sarkaar ke khilaaf bigul to foonka lekin sangh kaa koi bada netaa nahin bolaa
 It is not easy for the new generation Dream Team to leave the old people out of the organization in a jolt, so sources say that even if Shah includes some older and older people in his team, then the role of those officials in the decision process is limited Will remain shah kii ranneeti he sanvaidhanik lihaaj se jaruri padon par puraane logon ko bithakar rajyon se yuva netaaon ko centre main jimmedaari dekar ubhaara jaae or yahi team sahi myne main shah kii team hogi jo samanaantar kaam karegi
 Shah strategizes with figures and ground facts and wants the same in the organization
 aane vaale samay main bijepi main ab data ke aadhaar par raajnneeti hogi or samvaad-samanvay ke liye takanic kaa bharpoor istemaal hoga
 Shah has first started implementing himself to change the working style of the organization
 masalan, charter vimaan or helicopter kaa istemaal nahin karne kaa faisla kiya gaya he
 Normally, big leaders like to stay in hotels during the state tour, but Shah adopted the Union system in UP and stayed in the families of the workers
 vishleshak raay kehete hai, “sangh kii puraani kaaryastylee apanaakar shah ne kaaryakartaaon se sidhaa samvaad kiya
 Now they will probably adopt that system all over the country
 ” bijepi main ab puure system ko outsors kar nigaah rakhane kii he
 Shah will be in the role of a CEO rather than chairman, but as a senior leader points out, this does not mean that workers will be ignored
 sutron ke mutabik shah sahaj sulabh nahin honge, lekin kaaryakartaaon kii baat centre tak pahunche, uske liye ek alag tantra banegaa
 According to a senior leader, this system would be similar to the way Internet banking is done today
 jahaan bank jaae bina bhi bank se kaam ho jaataa he
 Similarly, the matter of the workers should reach the center and they do not have to come to Delhi and revolve around the leaders
 modi-shah kii ranneeti dream team taiyaar kar agle loksabhaa chunaav main nai bijepi ko maidan main utaarne kii he
 It is clear from the working style of Shah and Modi that only those who can run in BJP will survive
 jatigat aadhaar waalon ko tarjeehabijapi ke bare main ek dharna he ki yah brahman-baniyon kii party he
 But the big challenge of the BJP, which has entered the modi-shah era after the atal-advani era, is to break this perception and make it a party of social justice
 party main is drushtikon se ram mandir andolan ke dinon kii charchaa bhi ho rahi he kyonki is daur main bijepi ke tamaam bade chehre gaiyr-brahman the, lekin baad main sthiti badal gai
 Even today, six leaders in the 11-member parliamentary board, the bjp's highest policy-making body, are from the Brahmin community
 lekin shah kii team main yah varchasv khatm hoga
 Shah has made it clear in the meeting of the National Council that now the party has to enter into new territory and do long term politics
 is lihaaj se party kaa bada focus uttar pradesh kaa vidhansabha chunaav he
 Under this strategy, the Modi government has defended the decision of the UPA government to grant Jat reservation from the Lok Sabha elections in the Supreme Court
 sutron ke mutabik upi main mayawati ke vot bank ko todgaye ke liye modi sarkaar jald hi pronnati main aarakshan bill ko rajnatik napha-nuksaan kii ranneeti ke saath aage badhaane par vichaar kar rahi he
 Under this strategy, Shah has got the bjp's constitution amended
 nae sanshodhan ke mutabik 40 se adhik loksabhaa siton vaale rajyon main padaadhikariyon kii sankhya badhaai jaaegi
 However, the number limit has not been fixed in it
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa bataate hai, “pehle team main kisi varisht netaa ke sifarishi chehre shaamil ho jate the
 But after this amendment, Shah will increase the people of his choice
 ” isi tarah jharkhand main bhi adivasee arjuna munda ke saath shah ne dalit samaaj ke raghuvar das ko aage badhaane kii ranneeti banaai he taaki saamaajik sameekaran ko durust kiya ja sake
 It is obvious that the BJP has now come out of the shadow of the atal-advani era, then Modi has become the top man among the second generation leaders who are implementing the plan to transform the BJP with new technology and youthful vigor
 They are engaged and Shah has become the bjp's vehicle of Modi's dreams
 philhal to lalu nitish sarkaar ko peeche baithkar haank rahe hai jabaki uski kerani kii jimmedaari bhi un par nahin aane vaali
 He spoke to India Today's Associate Editor Amitabh Srivastava

 Therefore, he will not have to face the anti-incumbency and you are also enjoying power
 nitishji kii sarkaar ko hamaara bahari samarthan sirf secular takaton ko majboot karne ke liye he, satta sukh ke liye nahin
 The merger of secular, socialist parties now seems far-fetched

 Me and they were still engaged in marriage
 ab ve ise aage badhayenge
 Will the merger be completed by the assembly elections? How can i tell the deadline
 iskaa matlab he ki yah nahin hoga
 i did not say that

 hamaari party main loktantr he
 Everyone has the right to give their opinion
 madhepura ke aapke saansad pappu yadav ne bhi kaha he ki argedy ko nitish kii bajaae maanjhi ko tarjeeh deni chahie?unki apni koi samasya hogi
 How do you find Nitish as a coalition partner? Our job is to strengthen the secular forces and ensure justice to the poor
 phir argedy ne sarkaar main hissedari kyon nahin kii? aap donon milakar sushasan kyon nahin dete?isliye kyonki 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main hamaare paas janadesh nahin tha
 The mandate was with Nitishji, so the government should run him
 yah samay logon ke paas jane kaa he, unhen bijepi kii sajishon ke khilaaf satark karne kaa he na ki kuch maheenon ke liye mantri banane kaa
 Will you also keep a watch on the government or insist on a minimum common program? Why would i monitor? If need be, i will talk to Nitishji

 Congress wants to fight further with senior leaders; Congress has been in faction for a long time in the Congress party, former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in the lead role in Haryana
 pehle ye parde ke peeche chalati thi, lekin ab ye khulkar saamne aane lagi he
 In such a situation, it has become difficult to find a way for the party high command
 haalanki nai kaaryakari adhyaksh sonia gandhi varisht netaaon ko saath lekar aage kii ladaai ladanaa chaahati hai
 He has placed senior leaders in his good book by giving preference to the senior leaders, in view of the fierce fighting in Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
 aise main yuva netritv par varisht netaa baari padate najar aa rahe hai
 Considering the factionalism of Bhupendra Singh Hooda vs Ashok Tanwarhariana, the party high command has decided to contest the assembly elections along with senior leaders
 kumari shailaja ko party ne pradesh adhyaksh kii jimmedaari saunpi he
 Former Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda appearing in the lead role and Ashok Tanwar's leave from the post of President of Haryana Pradesh Congress Committee clearly shows that the team is run by Sonia Gandhi
 yah baat kisi se chuphi nahin ki ashok tanvar rahul gandhi kii pasand hai
 Despite all the tug of war, he remained the state president of the party for the last 6 years
 darasal, bhupendra singh hooda ko tanvar ke tewaron ke saath patari bithaane main hameshaa dikkat mahasoos hoti rahi
 He also lamented that his seniority was not being given much consideration and Ashok Tanwar used to report to Rahul Gandhi
 ho saktaa he isse hooda ke sammaan ko thes pahunchi ho or tabhi se unki tanvar se than gai
 As such, the tussle between Hooda and Tanwar caught hold of the state before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 ashok gahalot vs sachin payalatrajasthan ke siem ashok gahalot or dipti siem sachin payalat ke bich kii kadavaahat kisi se chhipi nahin he
 Recently on the Rajiv Gandhi Jayanti, both the veterans opened the front against each other
 is kaarykram main siem gahalot ne kaha tha ki jab rajasthan main akaal aayaa tha to rajeev gandhi ne hamaari baat maanate hue tatkaal madad di thi
 On this, the Deputy CM had taunted that the way Chief Minister Rajiv Gandhi obeyed you, in the same way, you should also obey the mlas
 darasal, rajasthan main congress kii vaapasi se pehle hi ashok gahalot or sachin payalat ke bich gaddi ke liye res shuru ho gai thi
 Because Rahul Gandhi had announced to contest Sachin Pilot as well as Ashok Gehlot in the assembly elections
 chunaav maidan main gahalot ke utarane se hi rajya main congress ke andar gahalot banaam payalat kaa vivaad shuru ho gaya tha
 During that time, Gehlot too was busy in the desire of the cm's chair and by saying his experience, he kept proving Sachin Pilot inferior
 haalanki sachin payalat ke pichhadane kii ek vajah ye bhi thi ki rajasthan main party ko ummid ke mutabik siten nahin milin
 The party remained one seat away from the majority
 agar siton kii sankhya 125 hoti to gahalot par sachin payalat baari padate
 At the same time, the high command of the party also felt that it would be appropriate to give preference to the experience
 jyotiraditya sindhiya vs kamalnathmadhya pradesh main congress pradesh adhyaksh ko lekar ghamaasan thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 Although the good days have come for the Congress, which returned to power after 15 years, the days of young leader Jyotiraditya Scindia in the state did not change
 ek vakt mukhyamantri ke chehre ke taur par dekhe jane vaale sindhiya pehle to is res main kamalnath se pichad gaye or phir loksabhaa chunaav main apni seat bhi haar gaye
 To overcome this double shock, Jyotiraditya wants to establish his coin in Madhya Pradesh
 iske liye unki najar pisisi chif kii kursi par tiki hui he
 For this, his supporters have opened a front
 sindhiya ne bhi apana massej mukhyamantri kamalnath tak pahunchaa diya he
 He said that it is the responsibility of the Chief Minister to resolve differences within the party after listening to all the parties
 vahiin, kamalnath ne bijepi ke do vidhayakon ko todakar dilli tak pehle hi bada sandesh de diya he
 In such a situation, the high command will trust Kamal Nath first
 hindi jagat ke mahamanch agenda ajtak ke '2019 world cap kii taiyaari' sheershak vaale satr main mangalvaar ko bhartiya cricket team ke do purv captain sunil gavaskar or kapil dev ne shirkat kii
 During this season both veterans touched on some mild and some serious aspects
 purv captain sunil gavaskar se jab yah poocha gaya ki kya vah maanate hai ki bhartiya team vishwa cap jeetegi, to unhone kaha ki haa jarur
 He said that he wants Mahendra Singh Dhoni to be the last ball of the last over in the final at Lord's, and Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Aamir should bowl from the front and need 6 runs to win
 aamir kii andar aati hui gend par dhoni sixsar maaren or thik vaisaa hi ishaara karen jaisaa unhone 2011 ke vishwacap final main kiya tha
 Gavaskar told- How much did it cost for IPL to be auctioned by Kapil Dev? Sunil Gavaskar said that the biggest weakness of the current team is bowling, especially giving more runs in the last over
 isiilie team chej karnaa pasand karti he
 But if a team like Pakistan set a target of more than 300 runs, then the pressure on the batsmen increases
 unhone kaha ki is team kii sabase badi takat ballebaaji he
 Batsmen like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli sometimes do not get a chance to play down players
 vahiin, kapil dev ne kaha ki unka dil to kahata he ham jeetenge, lekin dimag kahata he ki bahut mehnat karne kii jarurat he
 Selection should be good
 aakhri ke chaar-paanch hafton main injuri nahin honi chahie
 And when we assume that a player will give us the tournament win, then the risk of defeat increases
 kapil ne kaha ki is team kaa aatmavishvaas isaki sabase badi takat he or ati aatmavishvaas sabase badi kamajori

 In the election season, there is a ruckus of rhetoric between Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi and bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 na modi koi mauka chhodte hai or na hi rahul 'shabdabaan' chalaane se baj aate hai
 Surrounding the previous NDA government on the issue of terrorism, Rahul Gandhi said on Monday that during the NDA regime, around 22,000 people were killed due to terrorism while in the five years of UPA, there were only 800 deaths due to terrorism
 baantne kii raajnneeti main maahir bijepi
 
 
 Rahul Gandhi said that we know how to fight terrorism as well as development in the country, whereas the people of BJP only know the politics of sharing and the work of dividing and fighting people
 unhone modi ke gujarat model ko ek baar phir toffee model bataate hue kaha ki vahaan keval ek udyogpati adani ko sarkaar ne 40 hajaar karod rupee kii madad kii or vah das saal main 300 karod se 40 hajaar karod rupee kaa aadmi ban gaya
 While the UPA government poured 30 thousand crore rupees into MNREGA and crores of poor laborers got at least 100 days of employment
 rahul ne kaha, 'bas yahi antar he unke or hamaare sochane main
 He thinks of industrialists while we think of poor, peasant laborers
 ''desh kii tarakkee main sabakaa khun-pasinaa laga he'rahul gandhi ne bijepi ko gherte hue kaha ki vah india shining kii baat karte hai, unki najaron main india chamak rahaa he or yah sab unki badaulat hua he aisa bijepi waalon kaa maananaa he lekin meri najar main bharat main jo tarakkee hui he usamen is desh ke majdoor, garib, kisaan, yuvaaon chote kaam karne waalon, naukari pesha or yahaan khadey police karmiyon kaa khun pasinaa laga he
 Rahul said that about 22,000 people were killed in the NDA government because of terrorism and one of his ministers went to Kandahar in Afghanistan, pleading
 aatankwaadiyon se maafee maang kar bandhakon ko chhudaa kar laae the
 'BJP talks about fighting hindu-muslim' We talk of ending terrorism as well as development and BJP only talks about Hindu fighting Muslim and Sikh fighting Christian
 unhone gujarat kii modi sarkaar par aarope lagaate hue kaha ki gujarat main aam aadmi kaa bhala nahin hua he balki keval sarkaar ke najdiki kuch audyogic gharaanon kaa hi bhala hua he
 He said that similarly, the Gujarat government provided loans to Tata at a cheaper rate
 vahaan garib kisaanon kii jaminen sarkaar ke najdiki udyogpatiyon ko di ja rahi he
 'we do work for the common people and Modi' Rahul said that the difference between Modi and us is that he thinks about the industrialists and we and the UPA government about the common people
 unhone adani ko paisa diya, tata ko paisa diya, hamaari sarkaar ne aam aadmi ke haath main manaregaa jaisaa rojgaar diya
 Likewise now given the right to food
 unhone kaha ki gujarat sarkaar ke aankade dekhie vahaan 40 lakh log bipiel se neeche hai, 40 pratishat logon ke paas pine kaa pani nahin he
 10 lakh youth are unemployed, yet it says that the Gujarat model should be implemented across the country
 rahul ne ginaayin upie kii uplabdhiyanunhone upie sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko ginate hue kaha ki pichley paanch saalon main hamaari sarkaar ne endie sarkaar ke kaarykaal kii tulana main zyada sadaken banavaain, bijli utpaadan doguna kar diya
 Brought 150 million people out of poverty
 desh main bhojan kaa adhikaar diya, shiksha kaa adhikaar diya
 Increased industries and developed every section of the society without any discrimination

 Along with this, he has also decided in his meeting that in the coming time, on the seat where the bjp's anti-incumbency has the greatest effect, he will put his candidates there, so that his candidates who are upset with the BJP and Congress They can win the election
 haalanki shankarasingh waghela raajnneeti ke manze hue khilaadi hai, jaankaar maanate hai ki, jis tarah pehle unhone kisi bhi raajnneetik party se naa judane kaa elaan kar ab khud keummidavaar khadey karne kaa faislalia he or ise sidhe taur par vot ko divide kar bijepi ko faaydaa pahunchane kii ranneeti kaa hissaa mana jaae
 Interestingly, the 13 mlas who have recently left the Congress party, including Vaghela's son, were not present in the meeting
 haalanki vah pehle hi bijepi main shaamil hone kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 It has become even more interesting to see Vaghela's role in the upcoming Gujarat Legislative Assembly

 ' Congress President Sonia Gandhi will file her nomination from Rae Bareli today
 jab wo namakan bharne ke liye raibareli pahunchengi tab unke saath bete rahul gandhi bhi saath honge
 Earlier, his daughter Priyanka and son-in-law Robert Vadra were also reported to be together, but now both of them are not going together because they have to go to Dehradun for family reasons
 namakan daakhil karne se pehle sonia puja karengi
 For years the Gandhi family has been worshiping before the nomination
 guru bhawan ke naam se mashhoor raibareli ke congress daftar main namakan se pehle puja paath kii parampara 45 saal se chali aa rahi he
 After Indira Gandhi, it has been retained by Sonia Gandhi
 pichley teen baar se ye puja pandit radheshyaam dikshit kara rahe hai
 Pandit Radheshyam had wished Sonia Gandhi's victory over this bedi of worship, reciting the mantra of Vighnaharta
 sonia 4 lakh voton se vijayi ghoshit kii gai thim
 This time also the desire is the same
 vighnaharta se prarthana vahi he
 Now call it the fruit of worship or the impact of the legacy of Gandhi family in Rai Bareli, there is neither an effective antagonist nor any other disturbance in front of Sonia
 raay bareli main ajey rahi hai sonia gandhi2009 main sonia gandhi 3 lakh 72 hajaar vot se jiti thim jabaki 2006 upachunaav main 2 lakh 56 hajaar vot or 2004 ke chunaav main 2 lakh 50 hajaar vot se jeet hasil kii thim
 Panditji's recognition for the victory of Sonia's big victory may have been the blessings of the puja recitation and the disturbance, but political analysts do not give any less credit to the weak opposition
 sonia ke khilaaf samaajawaadee party is baar bhi koi ummidwar nahin khadaa karne kaa elaan kiya he, to bijepi ne uma bharti ke naam par tamaam ho hallaa ke baavjood elaan kiya ajay agarwal kii ummidavaari kaa
 In terms of chance, what is the image of Ajay Aggarwal, who changes the party often in Amethi, and to what extent he will compete against Sonia, you can guess yourself
 bijepi kii taraf se sonia ke saamne chunavi bali kaa bakra hi sahi, congress anushthan main koi kami nahin
 Sonia is waiting everywhere from the party headquarters to the DM office
 kyonki chunavi ghamaasan kaa aupchaarik aagaaj raibareli main sonia ke namakan ke baad hi shuru hota rahaa he
 BJP, riding on Modi's wave, is definitely talking about defeating Sonia
 lekin ummidavaar ke kad or haisiyat ko dekhte hue daawa jubaani hi lag rahaa he

 kavi or lekhak prasoon joshi ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan pradhanmantri ne apane nijee anubhavon ke saath-saath sarkaar ke kaamkaaj par bhi baat kii
 During this, while answering a question, he said that only government cannot do development in the country, it should be a public participation work
 pradhanmantri ne kaha,''loktantr koi contract agreement nahin he ki maine aaj thappa maaraa vot de diya
 Work for 5 years, i will ask later what you did, otherwise i will bring another
 ye koi lebar contract nahin he, ye bhagidaari kaa kaam he''
 Actually, the Prime Minister was asked the question that he hired people along with the government
 log bhi aaj sarkaar ke saath kaam kar rahe hai
 PM Modi heard the story of the surgical strike- called PAK and said that in response to this question, the Prime Minister said that when the fight for independence was being fought, from 1857 to 1947 there were many people in the country for the country
 Was ready to die
 or har jagah aise hi hota tha, log ladaai lard rahe the, shahid ho jate the or phir doosraa khadaa ho jaataa tha
 But Mahatma Gandhi made this fight a mass movement, if anyone was doing anything, then linked it with independence
 piem ne kaha ki mahatma gandhi ne logon se kaha ki agar tum jhaadu laga rahe ho to azaadi ke liye, shikshak hai to bhi azaadi ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 Saying his point, he said that our government has done this only in the last few times
 unhone bataaya ki ham toilet banane main, svachh bharat ke abhiyaan main har kisi main logon ko saath lekar chal rahe hai
 If there is public participation then only development will happen, the government will not be able to develop on its own

 Sharad Yadav said that he has no faith in Ram temple and he only worships a living human
 unhone kaha ki yogi adityanath kaa kaam ghanta bajaanaa he, wo ghanta bajaaen
 Sharad Yadav resorted to the Constitution for this idea
 unhone kaha, 'jab samvidhan main nahin likhaa he to main kyon puja karu
 Nowhere is it written in the Constitution to worship
 samvidhan main in baton kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Talking to reporters further, Sharad Yadav said that leadership in the grand alliance will be collective
 baad main tay karenge ki piem koun hoga
 Sharad Yadav attacked the Modi government and said that it is a wonderful and wonderful government

 ram kii janmabhumi he, aapaki hogi aasthaa, hamaari nahin he
 What is the harm in this? aap bhi zindaa, ham bhi zindaa hai

 uttari rajyon se jat samudaay ke hajaaron sadsy haryana main jari andolan ko samarthan dene ke liye yahaan jantar mantar pahunche

 He informed that members of the community will submit a memorandum to the President and Prime Minister regarding reservation and will march towards Parliament
 tippaniyan Apart from the demand for reservation in education and government jobs under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, the Jats were released during the last year's agitation to release jailed people, withdraw cases filed during demonstrations and were killed in the meantime
 They are demanding to provide jobs to the families of the injured
 vigat varsh jat andolan ke dauraan hui hinsa main haryana ke kai sthanon par 30 log maare gaye the or karodon rupee kii sampatti ko nuksaan pahunchaa tha
 Roads leading to the protest site were filled with Jat agitators from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Punjab, causing trouble to the drivers passing through the area
 aayojan sthal tak pahunchane vaale pradarshnakariyon kii bheed se nipatane ke liye pramukh chauraahon or margon par police or yatayaat karmiyon ko tainaat kiya gaya tha
 Yashpal Malik, president of the Akhil Bharatiya Jat Reservation Sangharsh Samiti, who is spearheading the agitation, said, "jat justice dharna is being organized at Jantar Mantar to express their demand for justice and reservation for members of the Jat community in Haryana '
 unhone bataaya ki samudaay ke sadsy aarakshan ko lekar raashtrapati or pradhanmantri ko ek gyaapan soupenge or sansad kii ore march nikaalenge

 goli maar dene kii baat mujhe nahin janchi, bhale hi yah baat isliye kahi gai ho ki thos tareeke se massej chalaa jaae
 In my opinion the Prime Minister should have avoided such excesses
 jin gau rakshakon ko ve do din se asaamaajik tatv, nakli gau rakshak, bharat kii ekta ko todane vaala mutthi bhar samooh bataa rahe the, unke liye yah kahana ki mujhe goli maar do magar mere dalit bhaaiyon ko mat maaro
 Those who are criminals of law and society in the eyes of the Prime Minister cannot be allowed to shoot our Prime Minister
 elahabaad kii parivartan raily main bhi pradhanmantri ne kah diya tha ki mujhe upi main ek baar mauka dijie, paanch saal main apane kisi kaam ke liye aapkaa nuksaan kar diya to mujhe laat maar kar baahar kar dijiega
 The Prime Minister should avoid kicking or shot type redundancy
 jis samasya par ve bol rahe the uski naitik zimmedaari unki to banati hi he, kyonki kai ghatnaayen unke yaa unki party kii shasit rajyon main hui hai
 But it is not that violence on Dalits has not happened in the governments of other parties
 daliton par atyaachaar kii ghatana vahaan bhi ho rahi he yaa hui he jahaan bijepi kii sarkaar nahin he
 But as the Prime Minister of the country or as the supreme leader of the BJP which runs the government in many states, he could have given this warning earlier also
 na dene ke kaaran kai logon main sandesh gaya ki in gau rakshakon ko bijepi kii sarkaron kaa sangrakshan praapt he, sangh or sangh ke sanghathanon kaa samarthan praapt he
 Therefore, bjp-ruled governments did not take any concrete action against them, but it is also true that non-bjp governments also gave the same exemption to these cow guards
 unhone ne bhi koi thos karrwai nahin kii
 They also looked helpless
 isliye pradhanmantri is samasya ko sambodhit karen, na ki iske bahaane khud ko
 But to see the second form of Prime Minister, you can listen to his speech given on GST
 ek technical vishay ko ve kitni saralata se sadan main bol gaye
 Simple as well as generous
 agar vitt mantri ko bura na lage to ve pradhanmantri se ye kala sikh sakate hai ki jiesti par janata se kaise samvaad kiya ja saktaa he
 But what is the matter that the Opposition did not welcome the Prime Minister's statement on cow guards who spoke with ease and generosity on GST, just as Rajnath Singh's speech in Pakistan
 pehali aalochana yah hui ki pehla ki unhone sirf daliton ke bare main kaha, musalamaanon ke bare main nahin jabaki is hinsa ke shikaar ve bhi ho rahe hai
 The second criticism is that he spoke too late
 lekin kya aalochak yah nahin dekh paa rahe hai ki unke is bayaan se ek jatke main in gau rakshakon kii raajnneetik, dharmik or saamaajik manyata samaapt ho gai he
 Till now, whenever they appeared on the screen or on the road, there used to be anti-social elements in the protection of any ideology and government
 pradhanmantri ne inke asaamaajit tatv hone kii pushti kar di he
 Earlier too some people were describing the actions of these cow guards as a threat to the democracy of India, the difference was that at that time the pro-social media supporters were looking at them through anti-government spectacles, seeing India as a defaming element
 
 pradhanmantri yahi baat pehle kah dete to hamaare gujarat ke oona main chaar dalit yuvakon ko ardhangn kar peetane kaa saahas koi dal nahin kar paata
 a poor woman is not killed by killing her at a railway station in Madhya Pradesh
 maarane ke baad use giraftaar karne kii himmat na hoti
 Nor would he have been able to take the cow from a cow guard truck in Haryana and drink cow dung and urine
 dadri ke akhlaaq kii hatya na hoti or uske baad kutarkon kii raajnneeti na hoti
 At least the Prime Minister could have stopped at the time when a picture of a cow was being printed on BJP posters in Bihar elections
 aise bhadakaau postaron ke bare main hi chunaav ayog ne centre se spasht adhikaar maange hai taaki in par pabandi lagaai ja sake
 Who are these fake cow guards? ye kis vichaardhaara ke raajnneetik ashram main palate badhate hai
 The truth is that these were even when the BJP government was not in the center or in many states
 ho saktaa he ki inkaa utpaat do saal main zyada bad gaya ho
 When Union ministers and BJP leaders start making statements in the same tone in the name of Gau Raksha, both cow protectors who do anti-social work are not seen speaking in the same language
 pradhanmantri or sangh ne rajya sarkaron ko yah kah kar khulaa sandesh de diya he ki in sabakaa biodeta taiyaar ho or sakht karrwai kii jaae
 This is the strongest aspect of his statement
 They are asking the same state governments to take action against those accused of incitement
 dekhte hai kis rajya main karrwai hoti he
 In Madhya Pradesh or Haryana or in UP Bihar or Bengal
 pradhanmantri ke bayaan se gau rakshak machal gaye hai, aresas ne bhi ravivaar raat bayaan jari kar pradhanmantri ke bayaan kaa samarthan kar diya
 The RSS has also said that efforts are being made by some anti-social elements of the society to destroy the harmony of the society by taking laws in their name and spreading violence in the name of cow protection
 isse gau raksha or gau seva ke pavitra kaary ke prati hinsa failaakar samaaj kaa sauhaard dooshit karne ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 The RSS calls upon the countrymen not to add such deplorable efforts of a handful of opportunists in the name of cow protection to the countrymen engaged in the sacred work of cow protection and bring out their real face
 chapche chappe par apane sanghathan or shakha kii maujuudagi kaa daawa karne vaale sangh ko bhi logon se apil kerani pad rahi he ki ve aise logon kaa asli cheharaa saamne laayen
 This appeal was to be made to your volunteers and you should find out and inform the ministers of the BJP governments and get them to take action
 lekin sangh kaa ek or bayaan he, doosraa bayaan kyon jari karnaa padaa ye to ham nahin bataa sakate lekin usamen kaaphi kuch badla badla sa laga
 It was said that at present, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh strongly condemns the incidents of atrocities and harassment of scheduled caste brothers in various places of the country
 kanoon apane haath main lekar apane hi samaaj ke bandhuon ko pratadit karnaa yah keval anyaay hi nahin, amanviyata ko bhi prakat karata he
 Was the statement released on Monday to add Scheduled Caste
 par donon hi bayaan main musalamaanon kaa koi zikr nahin aayaa
 Apart from this, the Sangh was also seen doing some balance
 pradhanmantri ne sattar assi fisadi gau rakshakon ko asamaajik tatv kaha he
 a handful of cow defenders have been mentioned in the Sangh's statement
 jab gau rakshakon ke atyaachaar par rajyasabha main charchaa hui tab virdohi dal ke saansadon ke alaava mayawati ne saaf-saaf kaha tha ki gauraksha ke naam par pehle puure desh ke andar musalmaan ke saath utpeedan kiya gaya, yuvak ke saath kiya gaya or ab madhya pradesh main jahaan bijepi kii sarkaar he, vahaan par mahilaon ko saream peeta gaya, police tamaasha dekhati rahi, bheed tamaasha dekhati rahi
 What would the government like to say in this regard? Comments pradhanmantri ne thik hi kaha ki gaayon ko plastic khilvaanaa band kar diya jaae to vahi sabase badi gau raksha hogi
 He should also have given separate instructions to the governments of his party that Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have established cow related departments
 iske baad bhi rajasthan patrika kii is khabar ke mutabik rajasthan ke jaipur ke hingonia gau shaala main pichley teen saal main 27,000 gaayen mar gayi
 We cannot confirm this report from our side, yet this number is so large that the cow demands an honest look at the mismanagement within the schools
 beemaari ke kaaran gaayon kii maut hoti he lekin bhukh se ek bhi gaay mari he to yah dardanaak he
 The Sangh should also have asked those true cow guards that where they have gone out protecting the cows that cows are dying in cow houses
 gaayen jab gau shaalaaon main surakshit nahin he to kahaan hai
 This question should be asked not only from Rajasthan but also from Bihar and Bengal, what is the status of their cow schools
 pradhanmantri ko laat maarna yaa goli maarna tip ke atirek se bachanaa hi chahie
 The moral responsibility of the problem on which he was speaking remains his, as many incidents have happened in his or his party's governed states
 magar aisa nahin he ki daliton par hinsa kii ghatana duusare dalon kii sarkaron main nahin hui he
 The incident of atrocities on Dalits is also taking place or where the BJP government is not there
 lekin desh ke pradhanmantri ke naate yaa kai rajyon main sarkaar chalaane vaali bijepi ke sarvocch netaa hone ke naate ve yah chetavanee pehle bhi de sakate the
 Due to refusal, the message was sent to many people that these cow guards have the patronage of the BJP governments, the support of the Sangh and the Sangh organizations
 isliye inke khilaaf bijepi shasit sarkaron ne bhi koi thos karrwai nahin kii magar yah bhi sahi he gaiyr bijepi sarkaron ne bhi in gau rakshakon ko waisi hi chhot di
 He also did not take any concrete action
 ve bhi laachaar nazar aae
 Therefore, the Prime Minister should address this problem, not on its own pretext
 par pradhanmantri ke duusare rup ko dekhnaa he to aap jiesti par die gaye unke bhaashan ko sun sakate hai
 How easily he spoke a technical topic in the House
 saralata se bhi or udaartaa se bhi
 If the Finance Minister does not mind, then he can learn this art from the Prime Minister on how to communicate with the public on GST
 lekin kya baat he ki jiesti par saralata or udaartaa se bolne vaale pradhanmantri ke gau rakshakon par die bayaan ko vipaksh ne us tarah swaagat nahin kiya jis tarah pakistan main rajnath singh ke bhaashan kaa kiya
 The first criticism was that the first was that he only spoke about Dalits and not about Muslims, while they are also being victims of this violence
 duusari aalochana yah ho rahi he ki unhone bahut der se bolaa
 But what the critics are not able to see is that in a jolt with this statement, the political, religious and social recognition of these cow guards has ended
 abhi tak ye jab bhi screen yaa sadak par avatarit hote the to kisi vichaardhaara or sarkaar ke sangrakshan main palane vaale asaamaajik tatv lagate the
 The Prime Minister has confirmed them to be anti-social elements
 pehle bhi kuch log in gau rakshakon kii harkaton ko bharat ke loktantr kaa khatara bataa rahe the, fark ye tha ki tab soshal media ke utpaati samarthak inhen sarkaar virdohi chashme se dekh rahe the, bharat ko badnaam karne vaale tatv ke rup main dekh rahe the
 If the Prime Minister had said this earlier, no party could have dared to beat and beat up four Dalit youths in Una in Gujarat
 madhya pradesh ke railway stesan par ek garib mahila ko utaar kar use maaraa nahin jaataa
 He would not have dared to arrest him after killing
 na hi haryana main us vyakti ko gau rakshak trek se utaar kar gobar or mutr pilaa pate
 Dadri's Akhalaq would not have been murdered and then there would have been no politics of sophists
 kam se kam pradhanmantri us vakt to roak hi sakate the jab bihar ke chunaavon main bijepi ke postaron par gaay kii tasviir chap rahi thi
 Only about such inflammatory posters, the Election Commission has demanded clear powers from the Center so that they can be banned
 ye nakli gau rakshak koun hai
 Which ideology thrives in the political ashram
 sach baat ye he ki ye tab bhi the jab bijepi kii sarkaar centre yaa kai rajyon main nahin thi
 It may be that their production has increased in two years
 jab centre ke mantri or bijepi ke netaa gau raksha ke naam par unheen tewaron main bayaan dene lagen to kya asamaajik kaary karne vaale gau rakshak, donon ek hi bhashaa main baat karte nazar nahin aae
 The Prime Minister and the Union have given an open message to the state governments saying that the curriculum vitae of all of them should be ready and strict action should be taken
 unke bayaan kaa yah sabase majboot paksh he ve unheen rajya sarkaron ko karrwai ke liye kah rahe hai jin par shah dene ke aarope hai
 Let's see in which state the action takes place
 madhya pradesh main yaa haryana main yaa upi bihar yaa bengal main
 Gau Rakshak has gone out of the Prime Minister's statement, the RS also issued a statement on Sunday night and supported the Prime Minister's statement
 aresas ne bhi kaha he ki samaaj ke kuch asaamaajik tatwon dwaara gau raksha ke naam par kuch sthanon par kanoon apane haath main lekar evam hinsa failaakar samaaj kaa sauhaard dooshit karne ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 By this, efforts are being made to pollute the harmony of society by spreading violence towards the sacred work of cow protection and cow service
 aresas deshavaasiyon se aahvaan karata he ki gau raksha ke naam par kuch mutthi bhar avasarwaadi logon ke aise nindaneey prayaason ko, gau raksha ke pavitra kaary main lage deshavaasiyon se naa joden or unka asli cheharaa saamne laayen
 The union, which claims the presence of its organization and branch on the chatter, is also appealing to the people to bring out the real face of such people
 ye apil apane swayansavekon se kerani thi ki aap pataa kar bijepi sarkaron ke mantriyon ko soochna den or karrwai karavaayen
 But there is another statement of the Sangh, why we had to issue a second statement, we cannot tell it, but it took a lot of revenge
 kaha gaya ki vartmaan samay main desh ke vibhinn sthanon par anusuchit jati ke bandhuon par atyaachaar evam utpeedan kii ho rahi ghatnaon kii rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kade shabdon main ghor ninda karata he
 Taking the law in your hands and torturing the captives of your own society, it not only shows injustice, but also inhumanity
 kya anusuchit jati jodne ke liye somvaar ko bayaan jari hua
 But in both the statements there was no mention of Muslims
 iske alaava sangh kuch balance bhi karata nazar aayaa
 The Prime Minister has called seventy eight percent of cow guards as anti-social elements
 sangh ke bayaan main kuch mutthi bhar gau rakshakon kii baat kahi gai he
 When the atrocities of cow guards were discussed in the Rajya Sabha, apart from the mps of the opposition party, Mayawati had clearly said that in the name of cow protection, Muslims were tortured all over the country, with the youth and now in Madhya Pradesh
 In where the BJP government is, the women were beaten up publicly, the police kept watching the spectacle, the crowd kept watching the spectacle
 is sambandh main sarkaar kya kahana chaahegi?tippaniyan The Prime Minister rightly said that if cows are stopped feeding plastic, then that will be the biggest cow protection
 unhen apni party kii sarkaron ko bhi alag se nirdesh dena chahie tha ki kyonki madhya pradesh or rajasthan ne gaay se sambadhit vibhaag kii sthapana kii he
 Even after this, according to the news of Rajasthan magazine, 27,000 cows died in the last three years at Hingonia Gau Shala in Jaipur, Rajasthan
 ham apni taraf se is report kii pushti nahin kar sakate phir bhi yah sankhya itani badi he ki gau shaalaaon ke bheetar kii kuvyavastha par eemaandaar nazar kii maang karti he
 Cows die due to disease, but if a single cow dies of hunger, it is painful
 sangh ko bhi un sachche gau rakshakon se poochna chahie tha ki ve gaayon kii raksha karte karte kahaan nikal gaye hai ki gau shaalaaon main gaayen mar rahi hai
 Where are the cows when the cow is not safe in schools? yah sawaal sirf rajasthan se hi nahin balki bihar or bengal se bhi poocha janaa chahie ki unke yahaan kii gau shaalaaon kii kya sthiti he
 But to see the second form of Prime Minister, you can listen to his speech given on GST
 ek technical vishay ko ve kitni saralata se sadan main bol gaye
 Simple as well as generous
 agar vitt mantri ko bura na lage to ve pradhanmantri se ye kala sikh sakate hai ki jiesti par janata se kaise samvaad kiya ja saktaa he
 But what is the matter that the Opposition did not welcome the Prime Minister's statement on cow guards who spoke with ease and generosity on GST, just as Rajnath Singh's speech in Pakistan
 pehali aalochana yah hui ki pehla ki unhone sirf daliton ke bare main kaha, musalamaanon ke bare main nahin jabaki is hinsa ke shikaar ve bhi ho rahe hai
 The second criticism is that he spoke too late
 lekin kya aalochak yah nahin dekh paa rahe hai ki unke is bayaan se ek jatke main in gau rakshakon kii raajnneetik, dharmik or saamaajik manyata samaapt ho gai he
 Till now, whenever they appeared on the screen or on the road, there used to be anti-social elements in the protection of any ideology and government
 pradhanmantri ne inke asaamaajit tatv hone kii pushti kar di he
 Earlier too some people were describing the actions of these cow guards as a threat to the democracy of India, the difference was that at that time the pro-social media supporters were looking at them through anti-government spectacles, seeing India as a defaming element
 
 pradhanmantri yahi baat pehle kah dete to hamaare gujarat ke oona main chaar dalit yuvakon ko ardhangn kar peetane kaa saahas koi dal nahin kar paata
 a poor woman is not killed by killing her at a railway station in Madhya Pradesh
 maarane ke baad use giraftaar karne kii himmat na hoti
 Nor would he have been able to take the cow from a cow guard truck in Haryana and drink cow dung and urine
 dadri ke akhlaaq kii hatya na hoti or uske baad kutarkon kii raajnneeti na hoti
 At least the Prime Minister could have stopped at the time when a picture of a cow was being printed on BJP posters in Bihar elections
 aise bhadakaau postaron ke bare main hi chunaav ayog ne centre se spasht adhikaar maange hai taaki in par pabandi lagaai ja sake
 Who are these fake cow guards? ye kis vichaardhaara ke raajnneetik ashram main palate badhate hai
 The truth is that these were even when the BJP government was not in the center or in many states
 ho saktaa he ki inkaa utpaat do saal main zyada bad gaya ho

 What would the government like to say in this regard? Comments pradhanmantri ne thik hi kaha ki gaayon ko plastic khilvaanaa band kar diya jaae to vahi sabase badi gau raksha hogi

 This question should be asked not only from Rajasthan but also from Bihar and Bengal, what is the status of their cow schools

 The department said on Sunday that the next two to three days of both the states are going to be very important
 is dauraan donon hi rajyon main baari se baari barish kaa anumaan jataayaa gaya he
 This alert of the department has added to the difficulties of the state governments
 bihar main lagaataar ho rahi barish or mausam vibhaag ke alert ke baad siem nitish kumaar ne bhartiya airforce se madad maangi he
 At the same time, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has canceled the leave of all the officials in the state

 Significantly, the leader of opposition Tejashwi Yadav has targeted CM Nitish Kumar on the situation created after continuous rains in Patna, the capital of Bihar
 tejasvi yadav ne pichley kain dinon se rajya main ho rahi barish ke chalate rajdhani or aasapaas ke ilaakon ke jalmagn ho jane ko lekar rajyasarkaar par kataaksh karte hue kaha, 'kuch ghanton kii barish ne rajya sarkaar ke sushasan kii pole kholkar kar di he
 Tejashwi Yadav said that a few hours of rain has disturbed the normal life of the people of Bihar
 unhone, 'gharon, skulon, aspataalon, karyaalayon, bazaar aadi main naaliyon se pani bah rahaa he
 He asked Nitish Kumar, "the Chief Minister should tell if a few hours of rain can be considered an emergency?" He said that the Nitish Kumar government has a habit of blaming the opposition and nature for the failure of its administration
 vahiin isse pehle baadh prabhavit ilaakon kaa daura karte hue siem nitish kumaar ne kaha tha ki is tarah kii sthiti kisi ke haath main nahin he
 It is natural

 The BJP had suggested that and the party is ready to support them on this issue
 satr ke samaapt hone main do din shesh hai or ham ummid karte hai ki sarkaar vidheyak ko paarit kara legi
 Shahnawaz Hussain said, "although the government is still keeping silence on this issue, it may be because there are no demonstrations on the streets
" ’ unhone kaha ki abhi bhi yah nishchit nahin he ki vidheyak sansad main paarit hoga yaa nahin
 The BJP leader alleged, 'the government is engulfed in corruption and hence it is nervous about the word' Lokpal '
 ’ Even today people are facing heavy jams in Delhi
 kaamanwealth games ke liye blue len ko rigerv kar diya gaya he jiske kaaran rajdhani ke kai ilaakon main aaj bhi sadakon par gaadiyaan rengti huin dikhin

 rashtramandal khelon se sambaddh vaahanon ke liye arakshit len shuru kiye jane se mangalvaar ko bhi pramukh sadakon par lanbaa jam laga or bason main baari bheed dekhi gai
 According to sources, there were reports of jam at Sarai Kale Khan, DND Flyover, Mathura Road and Ashram intersection
 aamtaur par kursi kaa zikr hote hi hamaare man main siyasat kii bagdor thaamne vaale netaa chhavi ubhartee he, lekin yahaan us kursi kii baat nahin kii ja rahi he
 In this story, the chair is being talked about, on which the policemen sit and rule the law
 kya koi yakeen karegaa ki is desh main ek thana aisa bhi he, jahaan rakhi ek kursi par baithna to chhodie, sirf use dekhakar hi police ke bade-bade afasaron kii saansen tham jaati hai
 a police station building in Mandali area of barmer, Rajasthan is always deserted
 din ho yaa raat, is police stesan ke ek khaas kamare main koi jane kii himmat nahin karata
 This is the reason why 100 years later Aaj Tak was forced to know the secret inside this building
 shahar kii teji se bhaagti jindagi is thane par aakar aksar tham si jaati he
 There is such a secret buried in this 100-year-old police station that even ordinary people, even the senior police officers equipped with bayonets, do not approach it
 is thane se afasaron ke dur bhaagane kii vajah he thanedaar kii ek kursi
 The chair which was kept in the police room, on which the officer once sat, was ruined
 sawaal yah he ki aakhir thane ke andar qadam rakhte hi pulisavaalon kaa khun sard kyon ho jaataa he? ye kursi police afasaron ko itnaa kyon daraati he? kursi par baithna to dur afasar isaki taraf dekhne se bhi kyon khauf khate hai? aakhir thane kii is kursi kaa kissa kya he?darasal anhoniyaan jab jindagi kaa hissaa banane lagati hai, to hamaari jindagi par asar bhi daalane lagati hai, sochane par majaboor kar detii hai
 There is some such secret of this building
 kuch aisa hi kissa he imaarat main rakhi kursi kaa or ye kissa he anhoni kaa
 Its building also tells a similar story, in which no one knows when to write whose character
 bade se bade police afasar bhi is imaarat main paanv rakhane se darate hai
 That too when the building is a police station
 yahaan rakhi kursi kaa khel hi niraala he
 It is said that till now any officer who showed courage to sit in this chair could not sit on this chair again
 itnaa hi nahin use to dobaaraa zile bhar main kursi naseeb nahin hui
 The officer who came to the police station, he was either suspended or transferred from the job as soon as he got out of the limits of the police station
 yun to police ke aalaa afasaron ke liye saal main ek baar jile ke har thane kaa daura karnaa zaruri hota he, lekin barmer ke is thane main kai barason se koi adhikari nahin aayaa
 Surprisingly, people here have not even seen the face of the police captain of the district for a long time
 kursi kaa khoff to samaj aata he, lekin thane main rahane vaale sipaahi isse beparwaah hon aisa nahin hai
 Fear is among them
 haal he main tainaat sipaahi mohanram sahamate kehete hai ki unhen raaton main neend nahin aati he
 Neither the building of this police station is deserted, nor is there any history associated with it in which fear resides
 log bemauf hai
 Aftershocks come and go, but those in uniform remain fearful
 is kadar ki rahasy kii is dhundh se khud ko mahafooz rakhane ke liye rose raat main baavardi durust pulisavaale yahaan diya roshan karte hai
 Actually, the story of Samadhi and Diyas is 100 years old and for so many years, police officers are terrified by this police station
 suni-sunai kahani par yakeen karen, to kareeb 100 saal pehle mandali thane ke andar bholanath naam ke baba rahaa karte the
 The police constables and the inspector served Baba
 isi dauraan thane main tainaat afasar kii maa kii maut ho gai
 When the officer asked his police captain for leave to go to the mother's funeral, the officers refused to leave
 ilaake ke logon kaa maananaa he ki is vaakye ke baad baba ne police afasaron ko shraap de diya
 From then till now, every police officer who steps in the police station gets suspended or is disbanded
 ise andhvishwaas kahen yaa phir kuch or, lekin ye sach he ki is thane kaa daura karne vaale darjanon afasar suspend ho chuke hai
 In the last one year, three officers dared to go here, but one of them had to be suspended, while two were transferred
 is tarah ke or bhi kai maamle dekhne ko mil jate hai, jahaan tarkshastra kaam nahin aata
 Only an incomprehensible puzzle comes in hand, which tries to solve it every day
 bihar main rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan (endie) main sab kuch in dinon thik nahin chal rahaa hai
 a fresh example of this was seen on Monday when former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi attacked Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan in sharp words
 maanjhi ne apane chunaav kshetra makhdumpur main patrakaron ke sawaalon ke jawaab main pehali baar paswan par sidhaa hamalaa bolaa
 In fact, Manjhi was not only upset about Paswan being let down by him at every opportunity, but he made up his mind that now he would be able to settle two accounts with Paswan publicly
 pichley dinon ek channel ke kaarykram main bhaag lete hue ramvilas paswan ne kaha tha ki maanjhi rajya str netaa hai jabaki apane bare main unhone kaha ki wo rashtriya str ke dalit netaa hai
 Not only this, Paswan sarcastically said that he has come new to the National Democratic Alliance and he has yet to prove whether he can transfer his caste Manjhi's vote
 isi ke jawaab main maanjhi ne apni bhadaas nikaalte hue kaha ki paswan ko keval apane parivaar kii chintaa rahati he na ki daliton kii or wo unhen cheentee samajhane kii galati na karen kyonki cheentee bhi hathi ko parrast kar sakati he
 The comments maanjhi ne paswan se poocha ki aakhir unki party main har pad par unke bete, bhai yaa damaad hi kyon asin hai
 Certainly Paswan was not aware of this attack by Manjhi and when asked his response on Monday, he deferred questions
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki aane vaale dinon main agar bijepi ke netaaon ne hastkshep nahin kiya to in donon dalit netaaon ke bich vakyuddh or tej ho saktaa he
 It is believed that Manjhi is also angry with Paswan and his son Chirag Paswan's statements in which Chirag has advocated for not giving tickets to Manjhi's party leaders from the coalition
 darasal, maanjhi har maukey par paswan dwaara unhen nicha dikhaae jane par na keval pareshaan the balki unhone man bana liya ki ab paswan se saarvajanik rup se do-do haath kar hisaab baraabar karenge
 Recently, while participating in a program of a channel, Ram Vilas Paswan had said that Manjhi is a state level leader while he said about himself that he is a national level Dalit leader
 yahi nahin paswan ne maanjhi par vyangy karte hue kaha ki wo rashtriya loktrantik gathbandhan main nae-nae aae hai or unhen abhi sabit karnaa baaki he ki wo apni jati maanjhi kaa vot trsanfer kara pate hai ki nahin
 Responding to this, Manjhi said that he is worried about his family and not the Dalits and should not make the mistake of considering them as ants, because ants can also defeat elephants
 tippaniyan Manjhi asked Paswan why his son, brother or son-in-law is in every position in his party
 nishchit rup se maanjhi ke is hamale kaa paswan ko andaja nahin tha or somvaar ko jab unki pratikriya poochi gayi to unhone sawaalon ko taal diya
 But it is believed that if the BJP leaders do not intervene in the coming days, then the war between these two Dalit leaders may intensify
 mana ja rahaa he ki maanjhi, paswan or unke bete chiraag paswan ke un bayanon se bhi naaraaz chal rahe hai jisamen chiraag ne maanjhi ke party ke kai netaaon ko gathbandhan se tikat na dene kii vakaalat kii he
 Not only this, Paswan sarcastically said that he has come new to the National Democratic Alliance and he has yet to prove whether he can transfer his caste Manjhi's vote
 isi ke jawaab main maanjhi ne apni bhadaas nikaalte hue kaha ki paswan ko keval apane parivaar kii chintaa rahati he na ki daliton kii or wo unhen cheentee samajhane kii galati na karen kyonki cheentee bhi hathi ko parrast kar sakati he

 bhavishya main kya hoga? bhavishya kaisaa dikhegaa? ye sawaal har kisi ke man main uthte hai
 Till now, Bollywood and Hollywood films have always shown technology, flying vehicles for the future
 lekin Netflix par nai series laila main is andaaj ko thodaa badla gaya he
 In this series of Huma Qureshi, the time of 2047 is shown, which shows that there will not be much difference between now and then
 haalanki siries main jo bhavishya dikhaaya gaya he wo thodaa daraata he
 And there is a strong debate on social media about this
 kyonki kuch aisa hoga, jo har kisi ko hairaan kar saktaa he
 Read some of the big points shown in the Laila series of 6 episodes
 
 
 machegi pani kii maar!2047 kii is kahani main shuruyaat hi pani se hoti he
 There are crowds in many parts about water, people are fighting each other
 naale kaa pani pi rahe hai, atm kii tarah pani kii jagah hai jise kharidkar hi kaam chal rahaa he
 So while Huma Qureshi's character Shalini also brings water into her house illegally and builds a swimming pool, which causes the death of her family
 itnaa hi nahin kaali barish kaa hona, kaale pani ko hi pinaa bhi sabhi ko chaunkaa saktaa he
 The Taj Mahal demolition! The Babri demolition in 1992 still holds a place in the politics of India
 lekin mohabbat kii nishaani maane jane vaale tajmahal ko kya koi gira saktaa he
 The same is shown in Laila, when the Hindu Rashtriya Aryavarta is established, the supporters of Joshi ji (the character's name) demolish the Taj Mahal
 series ke ek seen main taj mahal giraate hue bhi dikhaaya gaya he
 Aryavart founded! Future has been shown differently in films so far, everyone has a home, money but this series has brought something new
 tab tak desh aryavart ban chukaa he or ek niyam ke tahat hi chal rahaa he
 Everyone is addressing each other as Jai Aryavart
 ek samudaay ko peedit kiya ja rahaa he
 Huma Qureshi's character is also married to a particular community, so she is purified in the series
 shuddhikaran kii prakriya!siries main ek jagah dikhaai gai he shram centre
 This is the place of Aryavarta, where women are forcibly brought
 jahaan unase kaam karaayaa jaataa he or pashyataap bhi karaayaa jaataa he, masalan jin hindu mahilaon ne dharm se ulat koi kaam kiya he, muslim yuvak se shaadi kii he
 Or the dignity of being a woman
 is jagah jhuthan khilaayaa jaataa he, mazdooree karwaai jaati he or factriyon main kaam par bheja jaataa he
 We do not see this in future films yet, because in the 21st century, there is talk of equalization of women
 jo aage jaakar or bhi vistaar hone jaisaa lagata he lekin series kaa najariya ek alag hi factor dikhaata he
 a pile of garbage rising from the buildings! Knowledge of climate change is seen around the world at this time
 lekin, swatchta kaa ye abhiyaan 2047 main dikh nahin rahaa he
 There are several scenes in the series that are covered with mountains of garbage and height of garbage high from buildings
 jo aapke bhavishya ko daraavna bataa rahi he
 If we talk about the whole series, then it has a total of 6 episodes, the length of an episode is about 40 to 50 minutes
 puri kahani huma kuraishi or unki beti ke aasapaas hi gumti he
 Apart from him, South Superstar Siddharth has also done a great role in the series
 haalanki, kuch jagah par series aapako bor bhi karti nazar aegi
 But Netflix has tried to do something different like every time

 Who do you think will be the choice of a president like Rahul Gandhi? If you are a member of a party that has been dominated by dynasty or known as Congress, then the only option would be her sister, Priyanka Gandhi
 congress main punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh jaise kaamyaab jananetaa in dinon virale hi dekhne ko milte hai
 Now he too has supported Shashi Tharoor's demand to make Priyanka Gandhi Vadra the party president
 amarinder singh ne kaha ki priyanka gandhi wadra congress adhyaksh ke rup main ek sahi vikalp hongi
 At the same time, he also said that Rahul Gandhi will need to take a decision on this, but if she is elected Congress President, she will get support from all sides
 tharur ne pitiai ko ravivaar ko die ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki unhen ummid he ki priyanka gandhi party adhyaksh pad ke liye chunaav ladengi
 She also said that it is for the Gandhi family to decide whether she will contest the post
 saath hi tharur ne spasht rup se kaha ki rahul gandhi ke istife ke baad netritv ko lekar 'spashtataa kii kami' party ko nuksaan pahunchaa rahi he
 Tharoor wants elections for all the important posts of the Congress Working Committee to pave the way for new leaders to come
 ' NDTV ko die ek intervyuu main tharur ne kaha ki congress kaarysmiti agle adhyaksh par faisla nahin kar sakati kyonki iske apane sadsy hi chunakar nahin aae hai
 The new demand for Priyanka Gandhi to be president has arisen when the Congress has failed to save its coalition government in Karnataka
 haalanki rahul gandhi ke 70 din pehle party adhyaksh kaa pad chhodane ke baad shaayad yah congress ke coma main hone kaa sabase bada sanket tha, lekin party ne sudhaar ke kuch sanket tab die jab priyanka gandhi ko adhyaksh banane ko lekar amarinder singh kii baat saarvajanik hui
 But the problem with this demand is that his brother Rahul Gandhi has specifically said that no one from his family should take his place when he is leaving the post
 haalanki isse aisa lagata he ki priyanka gandhi ke liye vikalp nahin bachate, lekin is kollam ko likhane se pehle jin varisht congressi netaaon se maine baat kii unhone kaha ki keval priyanka hi wo hai jo party ke vibhaajan ko roak sakati hai kyonki team sonia or team rahul aamane-saamne hai
 Rahul Gandhi's 18-month tenure as party president was full of unrest when compared to his mother Sonia Gandhi
 sonia ne 19 saalon tak party pramukh kii jimmedaari nibhaai jo congress main sabase lambey samay tak kaa kaarykaal rahaa he
 a senior leader argued, 'rahul Gandhi did not think about his decision
 vah kaise apni bahan ko adhyaksh banane se roak sakate hai
 Especially when the party wants this
 wo koun sa gaiyr gandhi party adhyaksh hoga jo sakriy raajnneeti main gandhi parivaar ke sabhi sadasyon ke saath kaam karne main sakasham hoga
 'clearly the Gandhi family is a humble elephant in the Congress office and no senior leader will go against them
 priyanka gandhi pehle is pad ke liye anicchhuk thim lekin maujuuda sankat jisane party ko jakad liya he, uske baad party bhi chaahati he ki wo aa jaaen
 Significantly, the Congress has a recent incident in which Priyanka Gandhi took a direct fight with UP CM Yogi Adityanath
 priyanka ne sonbhadra hinsa main maare gaye 10 logon ke parijanon se mulaakaat kii koshish kii thi
 Priyanka was detained and spent the whole night in the guest house
 unhone is baat par jor diya tha ki unhen rahul gandhi ne vahaan bheja tha
 At that time Rahul Gandhi was in the United States
 lekin yah ingit karata he ki priyanka kitni yuddhrat hai
 Otherwise she was trending earlier only because she was supporting her brother's desire not to continue in office
 maine pehle bhi likhaa tha ki sonbhadra belchi pal nahin tha
 Like Dadi Indira, Priyanka emerged as a sharp politician
 or congress khud ko akramak karne main kaamyaab rahi kyonki kuch netaaon ne uske samarthan main guest house pahunchane kii koshish kii
 But for the Congress, no Gandhi can do wrong
 priyanka ko abhi bhi matadaataaon ke saath ek bade netaa ke rup main khud ko sthapit karne ke liye ek lanbaa rasta tay karnaa he or yah sunishchit karnaa he ki sonbhadra, rahul gandhi kaa bhatta parsul vaala maamla nahin he
 In May 2011, Rahul Gandhi went on a bike to protest in the village of UP to protest the Mayawati government's land acquisition and was arrested
 aakhirkaar rahul gandhi kii raajnneeti ke shoot and scoot skool main yah sirf ek or kshan ban gaya, jab vah is mudde par kisi bhi nirantarata ko banaae rakhane main vifal rahe
 Tharoor and Singh had told what the Congress was thinking
 or yah sambhav nahin he ki unhone aisa priyanka gandhi kii satahi jaankaree ke bina kiya ho
 Sonia Gandhi has already turned down the appeal of senior leaders to become interim president
 shaayad shakti kii kami se jujh rahi congress jahaan saare faisle rahul gandhi ke naam par jari hote the, main ab unke pad tyaagane ke baad kuch alag hi kahani he
 Perhaps the downfall of the Karnataka government and the huge gesture given by Tamil Nadu ally and DMK chief Stalin is driving them away from political power
 dramuk pramukh ne 7 agast ko chennai main pashchim bengal kii siem mamata banerjee ko apane pita karunanidhi kii raajnneetik murti kaa udghaatan karne ke liye aamantrit kiya
 While Banerjee is not a formal collaborator
 pichley saal disambar main sonia gandhi ko bhi isi tarah ke sammaan ke liye aamantrit kiya gaya tha
 Therefore, when Gandhi demonstrated a lot of dharna, there are signs that there is no decline in the party but they are there
 gandhi tanaav kaarak or tanaav pratikriya donon hai

 The central government is preparing to implement the Goods and Services Tax across the country from July
 jahaan jiesti lagu hone ke baad centre sarkaar ko aamadani main badhotaree kii ummid he
 At the same time, it is also claimed that GST will bring big business opportunities in the country
 jiesti kendra sarkaar ke liye badi raahat sabit hogi kyonki berogari ke aankade use pareshaan kar rahe hai
 As a result, the government has expected the highest from traders with a turnover of Rs 75 lakh
 is turnover vaale desh main bade str par trading, manuphaccharing or restaurant kaarobaari hai
 In these areas, the business is likely to intensify after GST
 kendra sarkaar ne trading kar rahe logon se 1 fisadi tex legi
 At the same time, it has decided to impose a tax of 2 per cent from small businessmen who manufacture and 5 per cent from those who do restaurant business
 maujuuda samay main in sabhi sevaaon par adhik tex tha
 The special thing is that most of the tax evasion was also in these areas
 confederation of indian industry (CII) ne ek adhyayan main paaya he ki GDP main 1% badhotaree se 25 lakh nae rojgaar paidaa honge
 GDP 2% to 2 since the implementation of GST
 5% se badhane kii ummid he
 As a result of which the income of the people will increase, the purchasing power of the people will also increase
 global hunt ke emdi sunil goyal kaa kahana he ki shuruaati 1-2 saalon main acounting or training companeeyon main GST ke lagu hone ke baad se naukariyaan aegi
 Manufacturing, FMCG, E-commerce, Telecom, Automotive and Media sectors will be the biggest beneficiaries
 inhen kshetron main sabase zyada naukariyaan bhi milengi
 Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Minister of State (independent Charge) for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, also says that 5 lakh computer operators will get jobs through GST
 unka kahana he ki 'jiesti lagu hone ke baad vaise 5 lakh computer operators kii jarurat hogi jinke paas foinanos related jaankaree hogi
 'now it remains to be seen whether GST meets the expectation of the government and small businessmen are able to take advantage of this tax deal and create new jobs
 bharat ke saath rishton ko aage badhaane kaa maamla ho to pakistani netaaon ke liye vah agnipath ke samaan ho jaataa he
 Who can understand this better than Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 ve ek baar satta kho chuke hai or unhone ek baar phir use daanv par laga diya he
 They have decided that they will carry forward the bond of relationship from where they left in 1999
 apane desh main ghor sanshay ko darkinar karte hue unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ke shapath grahan samaaroh main shaamil hone kaa nyotaa sweekaar kiya
 After that everything went in vain
 videsh sachiv str kii baatcheet kii bahaali main rukaawat aa gai or sakht bayanon ne maahaul ko khatta kar diya
 The initiative by India, which met between the two Prime Ministers during the Ufa summit, broke this deadlock
 lekin donon ore kii garmagarmi kii vajah se pichley ek saal se kaayam tanaav kii prishthbhumi ne is baithak se ummiden banane nahin deen
 There is a lot of change in the atmosphere in Pakistan and the perception is growing that the new Indian leader is not interested in moving forward
 june main dhaka main modi ke bhaashan or phir pakistan kii ek adaalat ke 2008 ke mumbai hamalon ke kathith mastermind jackieur rahamaan lakhvi kii rihaai saaf taur par rishton main ai giravat kaa sanket the
 The Pakistani people in particular were apprehensive of the Indian leadership's attacking tone
 jaahir tha, isliye jab ve upha shikhar baithak ke liye gaye to sharif par kaaphi dabaav tha
 So it is no surprise that the result of the meeting has created a lot of anger in Pakistan
 vahaan tamaam vipakshi dalon ne sharif par bhartiya ishaare par chalane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 From his moves to the Indian Prime Minister to his move, from the terminology to the joint statement, Sharif has set several deep targets
 talavaarein to usee samay khinch gai thim jab donon netaaon ne haath milaae the
 a tweet by former Home Minister and now Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Senator Rehman Malik went viral
 usamen unhone kaha, ''hamaare pradhanmantri ko lambey galiyare main chalakar janaa padaa or narendra modi ne itani bhi shaleenta nahin dikhaai ki ve aage badhkar unki agavaani karte
 After the meeting, the joint statement of the two foreign secretaries, as if the attacks were bombarded
 vipakshi netaaon ne sharif par ghutane techne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Imran Khan's Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf Party spokesperson Sheerin Mazari was also behind
 unhone aarope lagaaya, ''vah bharatiyon kaa likhaa ek masauda tha jis par hamaare pradhanmantri ne dastakhat kar die
 "mazari felt that Sharif's invitation to the Indian Head of Government to visit Pakistan was non-essential and" surpassed the requirements of diplomatic etiquette "as it could go on as a normal routine process
 vipakshi netaa kashmir mudde par khamoshi se bhi utane hi pareshaan the
 What many critics express deep disappointment was that there was no mention of any sort of restart of joint negotiations, as well as handling of pending issues
 modi kii kootnithik kamyaabi kaa dhol peet rahe kai bhartiya tivi vishleshkon ne in bhaawanaaon ko or bhadakaayaa
 These comments reinforced the notion that the statement after the meeting was completely one-sided
 bharat main purv pakistani ucchayukta ashraf jahangir kaaji ne elaan kar daalaa, ''sanyukt bayaan ek gaiyr-jaruri traasadee tha
 "so of course the Ufa meeting has again pushed Sharif on the backfoot
" iske baavjood unki ore se is baat kaa koi sanket nahin he ki ve aalochanaon se jhukkar kadam peeche khinchne par vichaar kar rahe hai
 His belief probably rests on that his government is politically more stable now than last year
 sarkaar pichley saal imran khan or maulavee tahirul ke samarthakon ke rajdhani islamabad kii gheraabandi se upje sankat se pehle hi ubar chuki he
 The success of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) in most by-elections in Punjab province has also strengthened the government's position
 arthvyavastha bhi sthir dikhaai detii he, haalanki oochaal lenaa abhi baaki he
 The economic growth rate of about four percent is the highest in the last six years and inflation is also at the lowest level of eight years
 china ke saath pakistan ke badhate aarthik rishton or dhanchaagat vikaas main 46 arab dollar ke chini nivesh ke samjhaute ne sharif kii saarvajanik haisiyat main or ijapha kiya he
 Meanwhile, there has been a sharp decline in terrorist attacks and the ongoing military operation against Taliban rebels in North Waziristan is also in the final stages
 is vajah se aatanki suraksha thikaanon ko nishaanaa banaakar koi badi vaardaat karne main naakaam ho chuke hai
 Pakistan's relations with Afghanistan have also improved significantly in recent months, further reducing the pressure on the regime
 pakistan ne taliban pratinidhiyon or afgaan sarkaar ke adhikariyon ke bich aitihaasik sidhi baatcheet kii mejabani bhi kii, jisase donon pakshon ke bich kargar shanti vaarta kii shuruyaat kii ummid jaagi he
 Importantly, Sharif's relationship with the military is far better than last year
 yakeenan, isaki vajahon main se ek sarkaar kaa yah faisla bhi he ki vah general parvej musharraf ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa abhiyog nahin lagaaegi, jo darasal sainya netritv ke saath tanaav kii ek badi vajah tha
 The great thing is that the two sides are giving each other space
 yah baat sahi he ki sharif ne khud ko zyada jhukaaya he lekin sena ne bhi khud ko rajnatik takat ke khel se baahar hi rakhaa he
 Of course, the army also plays an important role in internal security when the country is facing rebellion and terrorist threats
 lambey samay tak sena suraksha or videsh niti ke ahm pahaluon main nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaati rahi he
 It is also a myth that the civil government has no role in making these policies
 yah sahi he ki jab bharat ke maamle main niti kii baat ho to sena ko saath lenaa jaruri he or sharif ko upha baithak par sena ke sheersh cmanderon ko bharose main lenaa chahie tha
 Of course, there may still be some differences of opinion, but the army will not impose any process to normalize the relationship so that the tension is reduced and it can get an opportunity to focus on growing terrorism
 or phir hamen yah nahin bhoolanaa chahie ki vah kargil kii ladaai ke sutaradhar musharraf hi the jinhone 2004 main bharat ke saath shanti prakriya ko aage badhaayaa tha
 No other Pakistani leader could show as much flexibility on the Kashmir issue as a military ruler had shown
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki mumbai par hue aatankwaadi hamalon ne us prakriya ko ulat diya lekin aage badaae kaa ek mauka to hameshaa maujuud rahata he
 Beyond the criticisms on the joint statement, there is a general consensus among all the major parties that the only way for the two countries to come out of this deadlock is through negotiations
 bharat ek kadam aage badaye to sharif do kadam aage aane ko taiyaar hai
 There is a need to move towards more meaningful dialogue for both the countries
 bahut kuch is par bhi nirbhar karegaa ki upha main jataai gai patibaddhtaon par or donon deshon ke bich tanaav ke mukhya strot par dhyaan dene ke liye baatcheet ko phir shuru karne kii disha main kitni tarakkee hoti he

 *** The three communities said that the boycott will not be done after the decree is issued after the choreographers teach dance movement
 Members of Gujarati, Jain and Sindhi community in Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh will not be able to get pre-wedding videos and photo-shoots before weddings
 isko lekar teenon samudaayon kii panchayaton ne farmaan jari kiya he
 At the same time it has also threatened in words that those who do not follow this decree will be boycotted
 jain samudaay panchayat ne shaadi-samarohon main dance sikhaane ke purush koreographers ke shaamil hone par bhi pratibandh laga diya he
 According to Sanjay Patel, who describes himself as the chairman of the Bhopal Gujarat community, a circular related to the ban on pre-wedding videos and photo shoots and the prohibition on the entry of male choreographers into 'ladies music' during weddings has been issued
 sanjay patel ne khud ko apni sanstha kii rashtriya ikai kaa sachiv bataaya
 Patel said, "the community has decided to ban such activities, as it is seen that many marriages break even before they exist
" ye samuhik faisla he or jo iskaa paalan nahin karegaa, unka samudaay se bahishkaar kar diya jayega
 The Sindhi community has also passed a similar proposal
 bhopal sindhi samudaay ke adhyaksh bhagwaan das israni ne kaha, “hamane pre wedding video or photo shoot par bain kaa prastaav paas kiya he
 Members of the community will be made aware of this decision through a circular
 circular taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The Jain community has also supported such a norm
 pramod himanshu jain ne kaha, “is tarah ke faisle kii zarurat tab samajhi gai, jab samudaay ke ek aadhyatmik guru ne shaadi se pehle hone samarohon main purush koreographers kii ore se dance movement sikhaye jane kaa mudda uthaaya
 "guru told porn" According to Himanshu Jain, promoter, his guru called it obscene, so necessary instructions were issued
 jain samudaay kaa maananaa he ki is tarah ke aayojan se samudaay ke saamaajik taane-bane par bura asar pad rahaa tha
 Earlier in May 2018, Sindhi Panchayat in Ujjain issued a similar decree regarding the pre wedding shoot
 lekin ujjain main samudaay ke andar hi kai logon ne us farmaan kaa virodh kiya
 Then some groups of the community had raised the question that one person or a group of people could not represent the whole community
 isi tarah ke vichaar bhopal main bhi sindhi, gujarati or jain samudaay ke kuch logon kii ore se dabe shabdon main vyakt kiye ja rahe hai, lekin khule taur parafarmanako chunauti dene kii koi himmat nahin kar rahaa
 BJP has given ticket to Bhojpuri cine star Dinesh Lal Yadav alias Nirhua from Azamgarh seat in Uttar Pradesh

 After Akhilesh Yadav came into the fray from Azamgarh seat, BJP was trying to field a strong face
 beete dinon bijepi main shaamil hue dinesh laal yadav urf nirahua ko akhilesh ke khilaaf maidan main utaara gaya he
 If we talk about equations, then the path of victory will not be easy for Nirhua
 samaajawaadee party, bahujan samaaj party or ralod ke gathbandhan ke baad akhilesh yadav ke maidan main utarane ke baad azamgarh main 'lathi-hathi or 786 ek saath chalenge' ke naare sunai de rahe hai
 Let me tell you, the population of Yadav, Muslim and Dalit community is more in Azamgarh
 yah sabhi sapa or basapa ke paaramparik voter maane jate hai
 It remains to be seen whether the bjp's plan to defeat Akhilesh Yadav through Dinesh Lal Yadav alias Nirhua, through the disintegration of Yadav voters and mobilization of backward class votes, is successful

 Pakistan is ready to cooperate with India in punishing the culprits of Mumbai attack
 yahi nahin wo apane kisi bhi ilaake kaa istemaal bharat ke khilaaf aatanki gatividhiyon main nahin hone degaa
 Zardari also assured that Pakistan is committed to putting any person in the dock of justice whose inclination is towards terrorist mentality
 unhone iske liye mumbai hamale ke mastermind or jamaat-ul-daawa ke pramukh hafid sadai ke khilaaf karrwai kaa hawala bhi diya
 It may also be necessary not to just speak, under the pressure of India and the US, Zardari may have been forced to say so, but, when Zardari was making big promises and claims in London, he might have forgotten that one day in Akhnoor sector of Jammu Already, their Rangers were firing on the outskirts
 jiskaa prakat makasad aatankiyon ko bhartiya seemaa main ghuspaith karana tha
 This is the reason why the BSF was forced to warn the Pak Rangers against the antics of such activities in the flag meeting
 is bich, pakistan ne bharat se isroyal se mili us soochna ko saajha karne ko kaha he jisamen kaha gaya he ki lashkar-e-taiyaba bharat main mumbai jaise hamale ho phir anjaam de saktaa he

 aam aadmi party kaa kahana he ki agar dilli main bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nyotaa miltaa he to isse vidhayakon kii kharid farokht ko badhaava milegaa
 In such a situation, the Aam Aadmi Party will oppose any attempt to form a BJP government in Delhi
 bijepi ke liye mushkil he bahumat hasil karnabijepi 31 vidhayakon main se 3 saansad ban chuke hai
 In such a situation, the strength of the assembly with 70 seats has come down to 67
 yani 34 hoga bahumat kaa aankada
 BJP has 29 mlas including 1 MLA from Shiromani Akali Dal
 - agar aam aadmi party vip jari kar detii he to bijepi ke paksh main vot karne vaale iske vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd ho jaaegi
 However, membership will not be canceled if two-thirds of the members (18) voted for BJP
 - isi tarah congress ke 8 main se 6 vidhayakon ko bijepi ke paksh main vot daalana hoga
 It does not seem possible
 -agar aap or congress ke kuch vidhayak biimaar pad jaaen va voting main hissaa nahin len to baat ban sakati he
 Will a secret voting form a government in Delhi? Since no party in Delhi is in a position to form a government
 dalbadal kanoon kii vajah se koi vidhayak party line se alag jaakar duusare dal kaa samarthan karne jokhim nahin uthaa saktaa lihaaja gupt matdaan sarkaar banane kaa behatar vikalp mana ja rahaa he
 For this, Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung will have to use his special authority which he got from Parliament through Delhi NCT Act
 is adhikaar ke tahat uparajyapal vidhaan sabha kaa vishesh satr ek sutri agenda ke liye bula sakate hai
 They can address the House
 wo vidhansabha ko gupt matdaan ke jariye apana netaa chunane kaa aadesh de sakate hai
 If the House agrees, the Speaker will have to conduct a secret vote on the order of the Lieutenant Governor
 ensiti act ke mutabik raajnneetik partiyaan apane ummidavaar ke paksh main matdaan karne kaa vip jari kar sakati hai
 But there is doubt that political parties will get the benefit of whip in the case of secret ballot
 is puure siyaasi khel kaa ek dilachasp pahalu ye he ki kam siton ke baavjood bijepi gupt matdaan ke liye taiyaar bataai jaati he
 But despite its MLA Dhir Singh being the Speaker of the Assembly, the Aam Aadmi Party is dragging on
 supreme court main hone vaali sunwaayee se pehle siyaasi bhagadaudraajnneetik galiyaaron main ye charchaa bhi khaasi tool pakad rahi he ki ye sara drama supreme court main nau sitambar ko hone vaali sunwaayee ke liye hi ho rahaa he
 Sources say that the central government wants to form a government in Delhi or not, but a strong reply should be given in the Supreme Court about its run-off
 ek baar ye kaam ho jaae to phir disambar janvari tak chunaav karaane kii sochenge
 By then the results of the Haryana and Maharashtra assembly elections will also come and the wind will be known
 isi bich november main dilli vidhansabha kii khaali padi teen siton par upachunaav bhi ho jaaenge
 That is, there are many opportunities for litmus test

 hasharvardhan, ramesh bidhudi or pravesh verma loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye or unhen apni vidhansabha siten chhodani padi thim
 The Aam Aadmi Party had won 28 seats in its first assembly elections and formed the government in Delhi with the external support of eight Congress mlas
