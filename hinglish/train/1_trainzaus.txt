is series ke dauraan yah bhi samaj aa rahaa he ki collejon kii grading ke liye neshnal acredation council (nack) kaa system bhi naakaafi or naakaam he
 a teacher from Surat said that when a team of Naik comes to our city, they have to send a sari and a box of sweets
 kai jagahon par nack kii team acha kaam bhi kar jaati he
 But what will happen with the NAC and rating, do you know that there are not 70 percent professors in such and such college
 hazaar se lekar das das hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya admician fees lekar barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 But this issue is not necessary
 murti banani chahie
 Heard that politicians have started drinking poison
 bharat ke lakhon-karodon chaatro ne uniwarsity main jaakar jo amrit piya he, usne hamaari vyavasthaaon ke saahas ko amar kar diya he or chaatro ko jarjar
 This line will be understood only when you read it four times and listen five times
 tippaniyan There is a happy news for the teachers of University
 aisa nahin he ki karaab system main khushiyaan nahin aati hai
 Come and will come
 prophessoron ke jivan main saatven vetan ayog kaa aagaman hua he, badhai
 The salary of teachers of Central University, State University and Aided College has increased
 is ghoshnaa se pataa chalaa ki bharat main 7 lakh, 58 hazaar professor hai
 i wish i could also find out how many lakh professors are not there in India
 selary zaruri he, kyonki jo bache hue professor-lekturer hai, padhaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat karte hai, khaskar hamane dilli uniwarsity main to dekha he, hamaare teacher hamen padhaane ke liye ghar par 5-5 ghante rose pard kar aate the
 Then we came to know for the first time that to teach we also have to read
 jo nahin padhaate hai wo principal yaa sattarudh dal kaa zaruri kaam karte hai
 That too is the work of nation building
 chaatr nirmaan se bhi bada kaam he raashtra nirmaan
 It is expected that there will be a press conference on the vacant posts as well
 jisamen bataaya jayega ki bahaali kii prakriya kaise paardarshee hogi
 Those who take the bag of the ruling party, not the readers, will get jobs
 rajasthan se chalate hai ab jharkhand
 Lets take the position of Ranchi University
 12 july, 1960 se ranchi universti chal rahi he
 Today there are 64 colleges under it
 23 post graduate vibhaag hai
 There are two lakh students, in the university where such a conscious population of young people is, there should be a golden age in the practice of democracy and systems
 magar ranchi uniwarsity ke chaatr bhi, lagata he ki class main professor kaa nahin, teen saal baad kisi tarah degree kaa intazaar karte rah jate hai
 The vacant posts here should have been restored directly, but not since 1982
 aap 21veen sadi main ja rahe hai, ranchi uniwarsity 20veen sadi main hi fansi padi he
 After getting promotion to Assistant Professor, Associate Professor then retired as a professor and the seats were vacant
 yahaan kantrect par teacher rakhe jate hai
 Research scholars take classes
 prophessoron ko prashasnic kaam karne hote hai kyonki in kaamon ke liye non teaching staff kii bhartee nahin hoti he
 i doubt that many students know that reading to teach their professor is also teaching
 na professor bataate hai or na chaatr poochhate hai
 Everyone feels that professors are computers, turn them on, teach on, so get admission from them, welcome the minister and also make charge of essay writing competition
 ranchi uniwarsity kaa yah ramlakhan singh yadav college he
 It is a college in the Koker area, 100 katha is built on the ground
 80 ke dashak se hi college kii zamin ko lekar nyaayik vivaad chal rahaa he
 This college is also an example of our judicial process
 40 saal main yah mukadmaa anjaam par nahin pahunchaa he
 Nobody showed activeness even in college
 supreme court ke ste ke kaaran yahaan par nayaa nirmaan nahin ho saktaa he
 It has 9500 students studying from inter to graduation
 chwis besd credit system lagu hone ke baad har vishay main shikshakon kii zarurat bad gai he
 Currently there are no more than one or two lecturers for any subject
 nae system ke hisaab se is college ko 150 ke kareeb shikshak chahie magar puraane system ke hisaab se 38 hi hai
 300 students have taken admission in history but the teacher is the same
 commers main aath sau chaatr hai, magar padhaane ke liye maatr 3 teacher hai
 The condition is that the teacher should take class or test or check the copy
 teen-teen, chaar-chaar maheenaa pariksha hoti he or phir kapi check hoti hai
 The teacher says that we still teach, but you can understand what education will be
 is college main ranchi ke aas-paas ke gramin ilaake se bachche padhane aate hai
 a student comes here cycling daily from 40 km, but the system fails him daily
 ek shikshak ne bataaya ki is dabaav se nipatane ke liye hamane khaas tarah se routine banaaya he taaki kisi vakt ek hazaar se adhik chaatr campus main na ho
 The professor at IIM Ahmadabad should do a study on Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College
 yah college mukhyamantri ke awaas se maatr teen kilometre kii duuri par he magar sarkaar kii nigaah se ek lakh prakaash varsh dur he
 Ramlakhan Singh Yadav was a strong politician of Bihar, there is a college in his name
 hamaare mulk main maatr 200 karod kii murti banane par vivaad ho gaya
 i am sorry for this maang yah honi chahie tha ki ram kii murti ban rahi he to 200 kii jagah 20,000 karod kii laagat se banani chahie
 So that the world knows that we may not be able to build a college for the youth of India, may not save those who have remained, but if we wish, the idol will be built
 hamaare yuva ab class rup main padhakar paas nahin honge, ve tivi channel ke saamne in vishyon par dibet dekhte hue agucated ho rahe hai
 The principal of Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College is right, what can they do when someone is not doing anything, what can they do
 hamaare sahyogi harbans or manoj ne dumka ke ek college kaa haal bheja he
 It is a separate university
 sido kanhu murmu uniwarsity
 The university has 13 colleges in Dumka, Deoghar, Godda, Jamtara, Pakur and Sahebganj
 1855 main sido kanhu ne angrezi hukumat or sahukaaron ke anyaay ke kilaaf awaz buland kii thi
 On the night of 30 June 1855, more than 10 thousand Santhals had gathered in Bhogandil village of Sahebganj district
 sido murmu or kanhu murmu ne us raat azaadi kaa elaan kar diya
 Their twin sisters Chand and Bhairav were also martyred
 1857 se pehle kaa yah santhal vidroh itihaas kaa ek nirnaayak panna he
 The story of the martyrdom of four siblings reaches the times, but the condition of the university named after Sido and Kanhu is also not good
 is uniwarsity main 55 hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya ujjwal hone kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 There should be 476 assistant professors in this university but there are only 288
 188 pad rikt hai
 There should be 34 posts of a reader but not a single reader
 yahaan ke 13 mahavidhyalayon main se sirf ek ke paas principal hone kaa saubhaahgya praapt hai
 The remaining 12 colleges do not even have principals
 chaatr or chaatraon ko ek baat samaj aa gai he
 University means taking and passing the exam
 is series ke dauraan kai jagahon ke chaatro or profasaron ne phone par bataaya ki ek hi kaam he jo chal rahaa he
 To fill the examination form and get the examination done
 iske alaava sab kaam band hai
 In every college, the principal and the vc's room and office in the university will be found shining
 vahaan gamale zarur milenge
 Protecting the environment, ruining studies
 shikshak jaanate hai ki hakeekat kya he, isliye daawa bhi nahin kar pate hai
 This is true
 jab padhaane vaala hoga hi nahin to jo bachaa hua he wo kaise sara padhaa degaa
 We have seen the condition of two universities of Jharkhand
 ab uttari chotanagpur ke vinoba bhaave uniwarsity kaa haal bataate hue garv sa mahasoos ho rahaa he
 That our today's leaders have not left any leaders in the matter of remembrance
 jise bhi yaad kiya he unki nishaani dekhakar yaad ke naam se hi ruh kaanp uthati he
 Now, nothing should be made in anyone's memory
 is uniwarsity main bhi 70 pratishat shikshakon kii kami bataai ja rahi he
 This university is postponed due to the remaining 30 percent teachers
 chaatr shikaayat karte hai, shikaayat sun lee jaati he
 Even if there is no action in our country, a hearing takes place
 ab to bahut se log sunwaayee ko hi karrwai samaj kar apana dharna agle dharne tak ke liye sthagit kar dete hai
 The teachers who remain are also required to do the administration of the college
 padhai kaa kaam bhale hi ruk jaae, prashasan kaa kaam nahin ruknaa chahie
 The people of India sleep in the belief that governance is going on
 baaki aspataal, skool chale na chale, kya fark padataa he
 There is hope in the university that after 9 years, the exercise of reinstatement of professors is starting
 kisi ko pataa nahin ki kya 70 fisadi bahaali hogi, magar bahaali hone ja rahi he yahi sunakar ummiido ke badal chaa gaye hai
 The estimate of the professor's arrival has become like the estimate of the Meteorological Department
 bharat duniya kaa akelaa desh hoga jahaan nahin padhaane ke liye itane college khole gaye hai
 In this situation you are deceived by the annoyance of the name of rating that the rating has started in India like the world
 ab collejon kii ranking hogi
 During this series, it is also understood that the National Accreditation Council (NAC) system for grading colleges is also insufficient and unsuccessful
 surat kii ek shikshika ne kaha ki hamaare shahar main nack kii team aati he to unhen sari or mithai kaa dibba dekar bhejnaa hota he
 In many places, Naik's team also does a good job
 par nack or reating se kya hoga, kya aapako pataa chalegaa ki falaan college main 70 fisadi professor nahin hai
 The future of ten thousand to ten thousand students is being wasted by taking admission fees
 magar yah masalaa zaruri nahin he
 The idol should be made
 suna he netaa log zehar pine lage hai
 The nectar that millions of students of India have drank by going to university has immortalized the courage of our systems and the students are shabby
 yah pankti tabhi samaj aegi jab aap ise chaar baar padhenge or paanch baar sunenge
 The comments universti ke shikshakon ke liye ek khushi kii khabar he
 It is not that bad systems do not bring happiness
 aati hai or aati rahengi
 The seventh pay commission has arrived in the life of the professors, congratulations
 centrel uniwarsity, state universti or aded college ke shikshakon kaa vetan badha he
 This announcement showed that there are 7 lakh, 58 thousand professors in India
 kaash yah bhi pataa chal jaataa ki bharat main kitne lakh professor nahin hai
 Salary is important, because the remaining professors and lecturers work hard to teach, especially as we have seen at Delhi University, our teachers used to study at home for 5-5 hours everyday to teach us
 tab hamen pehali baar pataa chalaa tha ki padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padataa he
 Those who do not teach do the essential work of the principal or the ruling party
 wo bhi raashtra nirmaan kaa hi kaam he
 Nation building is a bigger task than student building
 ummid he khaali padon par bhi ek press conference hogi
 Which will explain how the restoration process will be transparent
 sattarudh dal kaa jhola uthaane waalon kii nahin, padhane waalon ko naukari milegi
 This is Ramlakhan Singh Yadav College of Ranchi University
 koker ilaake main yah college he, 100 kattha zamin par bana he
 Since the 80s, there has been a judicial dispute over the college's land
 yah college hamaari nyaayik prakriya kii bhi misaal he
 In 40 years, this case has not reached its end
 college main bhi kisi ne sakriyata nahin dikhaai
 There cannot be a new construction here due to the stay of the Supreme Court
 yahaan par inter se lekar grajuation ke 9500 chaatr padhate hai
 With the introduction of the choice based credit system, the need of teachers in every subject has increased
 is vakt kisi bhi vishay ke liye ek yaa do se zyaada lekturer nahin hai
 According to the new system, this college needs about 150 teachers, but according to the old system, there are only 38
 itihaas main 300 chaatro ne admician liya he magar teacher ek hi hai
 There are eight hundred students in commerce, but only 3 teachers to teach
 haalat yah he ki shikshak class le yaa imtahaan le yaa kapi check kare
 There is a three-three, four-month exam and then a copy check
 shikshak kehete hai ki phir bhi ham log padhaa lete hai, magar aap samaj sakate hai ki kya padhai hoti hogi
 The college attracts children from rural areas around Ranchi
 ek chaatr to yahaan 40 kimi se rose cycle chalaakar aata he magar system use rose fail karata hoga
 One teacher told that to deal with this pressure, we have specially designed a routine so that no more than one thousand students are on campus at any given time
 im ahambadabad ke professor ko ramlakhan singh yadav college par ek adhyayan karnaa chahie
 The college is just three kilometers away from the Chief Minister's residence, but one lakh light years away from the government's eyes
 ramlakhan singh yadav bihar ke dabang netaa hue the, inke naam par kai jagahon par college he
 In our country, there was a dispute over the making of a statue of only 200 crores
 iskaa mujhe dukh he
 The demand should have been that if the idol of Ram is being built then it should be built at a cost of 20,000 crores instead of 200
 taaki duniya ko pataa chale ki ham bharat ke naujavaanon ke liye college bhale na bana sake, jo bane hue hai, unhen bhale na bachaa sake, magar murti ham chaah len to banaakar rahenge
 Our youth will not pass by studying in class, they are getting educated by watching debates on these topics in front of the TV channel
 ramlakhan singh yadav college ke principal sahab kii baat sahi he, aakhir ve kya kar sakate hai, jab koi kuch kar hi nahin rahaa he ve kya kar sakate hai
 Our colleagues Harbans and Manoj have sent the hall of a college in Dumka
 ye ek alag uniwarsity he
 Sido Kanhu Murmu University
 is uniwarsity main dumka, devgarh, godda, jamtada, pakudaur sahibganj ke 13 mahavidhyalay aate hai
 In 1855, Sido Kanhu raised his voice against the injustice of English rule and moneylenders
 30 june, 1855 kii raat sahibganj zila ke bhogandil gaanv main 10 hazaar se adhik santhal jamaa hue the
 Sido Murmu and Kanhu Murmu declared independence that night
 inaki zudwaan bahanen chand or bhairav bhi shahid ho gai thim
 This Santhal rebellion before 1857 is a defining page in history
 chaar bhai-bahanon ke shahid hone kaa kissa kaash jamaane tak pahunchataa magar sido or kanhu ke naam par bani uniwarsity kii haalat bhi thik nahin he
 The future of 55 thousand students in this university is waiting to be bright
 is universti main 476 assitant professor hone chahie magar 288 hi hai
 188 posts are vacant
 reader ke 34 pad hone chahie magar ek bhi reader nahin he
 Only one of the 13 colleges here has the privilege of being the principal
 baaki 12 college main principal bhi nahin hai
 Students and students have understood one thing
 uniwarsity kaa matlab pariksha dena or paas kar janaa he
 During this series, students and professors from many places told on the phone that there is only one thing that is going on
 imtahaan kaa farm bharaana or imtahaan karana
 Apart from this, all work is closed
 har college main principal or uniwarsity main visi kaa cameraa or aphis chamakta hua milegaa
 Pottery will definitely be found there
 padhai barbaad kar, paryaavaran kii raksha karte hue
 Teachers know what the reality is, so they are unable to claim it either
 yah baat sahi he
 When there is no one to teach, then what is left will teach the whole
 jharkhand ke do vishvavidhyalayon kaa haal hamane dekha
 Now i feel proud to tell the condition of Vinoba Bhave University in North Chotanagpur
 yahi ki hamaare aaj ke netaaon ne yaad karne ke maamle main kisi bhi netaa ko nahin choda
 On seeing the sign of anyone who has remembered, the soul trembles in the name of remembrance
 ab kuch ho kisi kii smriti main kuch bhi na bane
 There is also a shortage of 70 percent teachers in this university
 maatr 30 pratishat bache hue shikshakon ke bharose yah uniwarsity tal rahi he
 Students complain, the complaint is heard
 hamaare desh main karrwai bhale na ho, sunwaayee ho jaati he
 Now, many people consider the hearing to be action and postpone their sit-in till the next strike
 jo shikshak bache hue hai unhen college ke prashasan kaa kaam bhi karnaa hota he
 Even if the work of education stops, the work of administration should not stop
 bharat kii janata isi yakeen main soti he ki shashan kaa prashasan chal rahaa he
 The rest of the hospitals, schools do not run, what is the difference
 uniwarsity main ab is baat ko lekar ummid jaagi he ki 9 saal baad prophessoron kii bahaali kii kavayad shuru ho rahi he
 No one knows if there will be 70 per cent restoration, but the restoration is going to happen, hearing this, there has been a cloud of expectations
 professor ke aane kaa anumaan mausam vibhaag ke anumaan jaisaa ho gaya hai
 India will be the only country in the world where so many colleges have been opened for not teaching
 is halaat main aapako reating naam ke jhunjhane se dhokhaa diya jaataa he ki bharat main bhi duniya kii tarah reating shuru ho gai he
 Now colleges will be ranked
 is series ke dauraan yah bhi samaj aa rahaa he ki collejon kii grading ke liye neshnal acredation council (nack) kaa system bhi naakaafi or naakaam he
 a teacher from Surat said that when a team of Naik comes to our city, they have to send a sari and a box of sweets
 kai jagahon par nack kii team acha kaam bhi kar jaati he
 But what will happen with the NAC and rating, do you know that there are not 70 percent professors in such and such college
 hazaar se lekar das das hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya admician fees lekar barbaad kiya ja rahaa he
 But this issue is not necessary
 murti banani chahie

 Then we came to know for the first time that to teach we also have to read

 hamaare sahyogi harbans or manoj ne dumka ke ek college kaa haal bheja he
 It is a separate university
 sido kanhu murmu uniwarsity
 The university has 13 colleges in Dumka, Deoghar, Godda, Jamtara, Pakur and Sahebganj
 1855 main sido kanhu ne angrezi hukumat or sahukaaron ke anyaay ke kilaaf awaz buland kii thi
 On the night of 30 June 1855, more than 10 thousand Santhals had gathered in Bhogandil village of Sahebganj district
 sido murmu or kanhu murmu ne us raat azaadi kaa elaan kar diya
 Their twin sisters Chand and Bhairav were also martyred
 1857 se pehle kaa yah santhal vidroh itihaas kaa ek nirnaayak panna he
 The story of the martyrdom of four siblings reaches the times, but the condition of the university named after Sido and Kanhu is also not good
 is uniwarsity main 55 hazaar chaatro kaa bhavishya ujjwal hone kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 There should be 476 assistant professors in this university but there are only 288
 188 pad rikt hai
 There should be 34 posts of a reader but not a single reader
 yahaan ke 13 mahavidhyalayon main se sirf ek ke paas principal hone kaa saubhaahgya praapt hai
 The remaining 12 colleges do not even have principals
 chaatr or chaatraon ko ek baat samaj aa gai he
 University means taking and passing the exam
 is series ke dauraan kai jagahon ke chaatro or profasaron ne phone par bataaya ki ek hi kaam he jo chal rahaa he
 To fill the examination form and get the examination done
 iske alaava sab kaam band hai
 In every college, the principal and the vc's room and office in the university will be found shining
 vahaan gamale zarur milenge
 Protecting the environment, ruining studies
 shikshak jaanate hai ki hakeekat kya he, isliye daawa bhi nahin kar pate hai
 This is true
 jab padhaane vaala hoga hi nahin to jo bachaa hua he wo kaise sara padhaa degaa
 We have seen the condition of two universities of Jharkhand
 ab uttari chotanagpur ke vinoba bhaave uniwarsity kaa haal bataate hue garv sa mahasoos ho rahaa he
 That our today's leaders have not left any leaders in the matter of remembrance
 jise bhi yaad kiya he unki nishaani dekhakar yaad ke naam se hi ruh kaanp uthati he
 Now, nothing should be made in anyone's memory
 is uniwarsity main bhi 70 pratishat shikshakon kii kami bataai ja rahi he
 This university is postponed due to the remaining 30 percent teachers
 chaatr shikaayat karte hai, shikaayat sun lee jaati he
 Even if there is no action in our country, a hearing takes place
 ab to bahut se log sunwaayee ko hi karrwai samaj kar apana dharna agle dharne tak ke liye sthagit kar dete hai
 The teachers who remain are also required to do the administration of the college
 padhai kaa kaam bhale hi ruk jaae, prashasan kaa kaam nahin ruknaa chahie
 The people of India sleep in the belief that governance is going on
 baaki aspataal, skool chale na chale, kya fark padataa he
 There is hope in the university that after 9 years, the exercise of reinstatement of professors is starting
 kisi ko pataa nahin ki kya 70 fisadi bahaali hogi, magar bahaali hone ja rahi he yahi sunakar ummiido ke badal chaa gaye hai
 The estimate of the professor's arrival has become like the estimate of the Meteorological Department
 bharat duniya kaa akelaa desh hoga jahaan nahin padhaane ke liye itane college khole gaye hai
 In this situation you are deceived by the annoyance of the name of rating that the rating has started in India like the world
 ab collejon kii ranking hogi
 During this series, it is also understood that the National Accreditation Council (NAC) system for grading colleges is also insufficient and unsuccessful
 surat kii ek shikshika ne kaha ki hamaare shahar main nack kii team aati he to unhen sari or mithai kaa dibba dekar bhejnaa hota he
 In many places, Naik's team also does a good job
 par nack or reating se kya hoga, kya aapako pataa chalegaa ki falaan college main 70 fisadi professor nahin hai
 The future of ten thousand to ten thousand students is being wasted by taking admission fees
 magar yah masalaa zaruri nahin he
 The idol should be made
 suna he netaa log zehar pine lage hai
 The nectar that millions of students of India have drank by going to university has immortalized the courage of our systems and the students are shabby
 yah pankti tabhi samaj aegi jab aap ise chaar baar padhenge or paanch baar sunenge
 The comments universti ke shikshakon ke liye ek khushi kii khabar he
 It is not that bad systems do not bring happiness
 aati hai or aati rahengi
 The seventh pay commission has arrived in the life of the professors, congratulations
 centrel uniwarsity, state universti or aded college ke shikshakon kaa vetan badha he
 This announcement showed that there are 7 lakh, 58 thousand professors in India
 kaash yah bhi pataa chal jaataa ki bharat main kitne lakh professor nahin hai
 Salary is important, because the remaining professors and lecturers work hard to teach, especially as we have seen at Delhi University, our teachers used to study at home for 5-5 hours everyday to teach us
 tab hamen pehali baar pataa chalaa tha ki padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padataa he
 Those who do not teach do the essential work of the principal or the ruling party
 wo bhi raashtra nirmaan kaa hi kaam he
 Nation building is a bigger task than student building
 ummid he khaali padon par bhi ek press conference hogi
 Which will explain how the restoration process will be transparent
 sattarudh dal kaa jhola uthaane waalon kii nahin, padhane waalon ko naukari milegi
 In 1855, Sido Kanhu raised his voice against the injustice of English rule and moneylenders
 30 june, 1855 kii raat sahibganj zila ke bhogandil gaanv main 10 hazaar se adhik santhal jamaa hue the
 Sido Murmu and Kanhu Murmu declared independence that night
 inaki zudwaan bahanen chand or bhairav bhi shahid ho gai thim
 This Santhal rebellion before 1857 is a defining page in history
 chaar bhai-bahanon ke shahid hone kaa kissa kaash jamaane tak pahunchataa magar sido or kanhu ke naam par bani uniwarsity kii haalat bhi thik nahin he
 The future of 55 thousand students in this university is waiting to be bright
 is universti main 476 assitant professor hone chahie magar 288 hi hai
 188 posts are vacant
 reader ke 34 pad hone chahie magar ek bhi reader nahin he
 Only one of the 13 colleges here has the privilege of being the principal
 baaki 12 college main principal bhi nahin hai
 Students and students have understood one thing
 uniwarsity kaa matlab pariksha dena or paas kar janaa he
 During this series, students and professors from many places told on the phone that there is only one thing that is going on
 imtahaan kaa farm bharaana or imtahaan karana
 Apart from this, all work is closed
 har college main principal or uniwarsity main visi kaa cameraa or aphis chamakta hua milegaa
 Pottery will definitely be found there
 padhai barbaad kar, paryaavaran kii raksha karte hue
 Teachers know what the reality is, so they are unable to claim it either
 yah baat sahi he
 When there is no one to teach, then what is left will teach the whole
 jharkhand ke do vishvavidhyalayon kaa haal hamane dekha

 selary zaruri he, kyonki jo bache hue professor-lekturer hai, padhaane ke liye kaaphi mehnat karte hai, khaskar hamane dilli uniwarsity main to dekha he, hamaare teacher hamen padhaane ke liye ghar par 5-5 ghante rose pard kar aate the
 Then we came to know for the first time that to teach we also have to read
 jo nahin padhaate hai wo principal yaa sattarudh dal kaa zaruri kaam karte hai
 That too is the work of nation building
 chaatr nirmaan se bhi bada kaam he raashtra nirmaan
 It is expected that there will be a press conference on the vacant posts as well
 jisamen bataaya jayega ki bahaali kii prakriya kaise paardarshee hogi
 Those who take the bag of the ruling party, not the readers, will get jobs
 universti ke shikshakon ke liye ek khushi kii khabar he
 It is not that bad systems do not bring happiness
 aati hai or aati rahengi
 The seventh pay commission has arrived in the life of the professors, congratulations
 centrel uniwarsity, state universti or aded college ke shikshakon kaa vetan badha he
 This announcement showed that there are 7 lakh, 58 thousand professors in India
 kaash yah bhi pataa chal jaataa ki bharat main kitne lakh professor nahin hai
 Salary is important, because the remaining professors and lecturers work hard to teach, especially as we have seen at Delhi University, our teachers used to study at home for 5-5 hours everyday to teach us
 tab hamen pehali baar pataa chalaa tha ki padhaane ke liye padhanaa bhi padataa he
 Those who do not teach do the essential work of the principal or the ruling party
 wo bhi raashtra nirmaan kaa hi kaam he
 Nation building is a bigger task than student building
 ummid he khaali padon par bhi ek press conference hogi
 Which will explain how the restoration process will be transparent
 sattarudh dal kaa jhola uthaane waalon kii nahin, padhane waalon ko naukari milegi

 congress netaa or loksabhaa main party ke mukhya sachetak jyotiraditya sindhiya ne isaki pushti kii
 The Congress has supported the legislation and Scindia says that it is important for the government to fix the maximum rate of tax in some way

 This is based on its merits and demerits
 jiesti desh ke liye mahatvapurn he
 The party will support the bill with amendments which the ruling party has assured us
 ’buudhvaar ko 122wein samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak korajyasabha main paritkiya gaya
 In this, the constitution is being amended to implement GST as a tax system in the country
 sindhiya ne bataaya, ‘hamane congress party ke sabhi loksabhaa sadasyon kii sadan main maujuudagi sunishchit karne ke liye vip jari kiya he
 He said that the idea of GST was first given by the Congress
 sindhiya ne kaha, ‘hamaare purv vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne apane bajet bhaashan main deshbhar main ekkar pranaliki avadharana kii baat kii thi

 'jiesti se desh ko phayda ho'madhya pradesh ke guna se loksabhaa sadsy sindhiya ne kaha, ‘ham chaahate hai ki desh ko jiesti se laabh ho
 It was the Congress who kept this idea
 ham ise paarit karnaa chahenge lekin sunishchit karnaa chahenge ki iske laabh janata or desh tak pahunchen
 The Congress had earlier demanded that the GST rate of interest be fixed at 18 percent

 Court dismisses Akshay's plea guilty in the Nirbhaya case
 supreme court ne kaha ki nirbhaya cese main jaanch or trial bilkul sahi hua
 The culprits had questioned it
 is maamle main sunwaayee ke dauraan akshay ke vakil ne nirbhaya ke dost ke kathith khulaase kaa hawala diya tha
 The court ruled it irrelevant
 supreme court main akshay kii rivyuu pitishan khaarij hone or patiala house court main faansee par faisla 7 janvari tak talane ke baad aakhir ab kya vikalp bache hai
 Know what legal options you can adopt to avoid being hanged by Nirbhaya
 nirbhaya cond ke mujarimon ko tihaad jail prashasan ne buudhvaar raat ko ek baar phir antim notice thama diya he
 The notice states that if he wishes, he can request the President's pardon within a week to avoid his death sentence
 tihaad jail kii ore se jin mujarimon ko ye notice thamaaye gaye, unka naam mukesh, akshay kumaar singh, pawan kumaar gupta or vinay hai
 Nirbhaya case convict Pawan Gupta has been imprisoned from Mandoli jail to Tihar jail a few days ago, while Akshay Kumar Singh, Mukesh and Vinay are already lodged in different jails of Tihar
 curative pitishan daayar karne kaa maukadoshiyon ko maut kii sajaa naa dene ko lekar vakil api singh ne court main ajibo-garib daleelein deen
 He said that according to Ved Purana, the age of people in Kali Yuga has reduced, so why hanged again? Akshay's lawyer said that he will do curative petition in a week
 ye bhi khaarij hone par dayaa yachika daayar kii jaaegi
 Akshay's lawyer said that Curitave would first file and then a mercy petition
 ab doshiyon ke paas curative pitishan kaa vikalp maujuud he
 1 week has been given for review and one week for filing mercy petition with the President
 dayaa yachika khaarij hone ke baad hi faansee di ja sakati he
 The defense can use the alleged revelations of Nirbhaya's friend in court
 bachaav paksh is maamle ko ek baar phir latakaane kii koshish karegaa
 After 2017, the defense will present the list of all cases in which the death sentence has been converted into life imprisonment
 isi tarah bachaav paksh is maamle main bhi doshiyon ko umr kaid kii sajaa dene kii maang kar saktaa he
 The hearing in Patiala House Court has been postponed to 7 January after the Tihar Jail administration gave 7 days time to the convicts
 nirbhaya ke parijanon kii maang thi ki turant deth warrant jari kiya jaae lekin court ne kaha ki doshiyon ko kanoonee vikalp aajamaane kaa puraa mauka milanaa chahie
 Now Tihar Jail Administration gave notice to the four convicts within seven days and asked what legal steps they wanted to take
 iske baad 7 janvari ko sunwaayee hogi
 But if the mercy petition is pending during this period, then on January 7, the death warrant will not be issued
 dayaa yachika nipat jane ke baad hi deth warrant jari hoga
 When will the death warrant be issued? Now the question is whether the defense will first file mercy petition or curative petition
 bachaav paksh kaa kahana he ki wo donon yachikaaon ko daakhil karegaa
 First curative petition and then mercy petition will be filed
 tamaam yachikaayen khaarij hone ke baad hi deth warrant jari hoga
 Nirbhaya's family again became unhappy, after getting a new date again in this case, Nirbhaya's family looked very angry and sad
 patiala house court main agali sunwaayee ab 7 janvari 2020 ko hogi
 In such a situation, the culprits have now got 20 days more time
 supreme court kii sunwaayee main kya hua?supreme court main buudhvaar ko nirbhaya maamle main doshi akshay kii punarvichaar yachika par supreme court main bahes hui
 The court gave thirty minutes to both sides
 donon ko ek ghante main puri baat kehani thi
 The debate was started by Akshay's lawyer AP Singh
 unhone kaha ki maamle main sabooton or jaanch main kai khamiyaan hai
 On this, Judge Bopanna said that this is not the time
 ye maamla pehle uthaanaa chahie tha
 In response, the lawyer for the ruling party AP Singh said that they are keeping new facts in the case
 unhone kaha ki maamle main media kaa pressure he
 The public is also constantly under pressure
 mere client ko faansee dete samay in baton ko bhi dhyaan dena chahie
 Lest the wrong decision be made under pressure
 unhone kaha ki maamle main gavaah nirbhaya ke dost ke khilaaf patiala house court main mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 a hearing is also scheduled against him on December 20
 is par supreme court ne poocha ki is maamal se uskaa kya lenaa dena
 Replying to the convict not entitled to any sympathy, public prosecutor Tushar Mehta said that the review petition in the case should be dismissed immediately
 is maamle par baaki doshiyon kii punarvichaar yachika khaarij ho chuki he
 In this case, thinking on it separately is a waste of time
 tushaar mehta ne kaha ki doshi kisi bhi tarah kii sahanubhuti ke hakdaar nahin hai unhen maut kii sazaa di jaae
 They are hanging the case by playing legal tricks

 dilli main aise logon kii koi kami nahin, jo alag-alag vajahon se dusron se unke jeene kaa haq hi chin liya karte hai yani unhen jaan se maar daalate hai

 sachin tendulkar ne pehali baar sweekaar kiya he ki 1999-2000 ke match phixing prakaran kaa asar unke pradarshan par padaa or bhartiya team ko kathin tathaa dardanaak daur se guzarana padaa kyonki ‘darshak unhen andeh kii najar se dekhne lage the
 Tendulkar said that his mood during India's 1999–2000 tour of Australia was not right
 sachin ne ek intervyuu main kaha ki mujhase kabhi kisi ne sampark nahin kiya or naa hi team baithkon main hamane is bare main koi baat kii
 He said that i remember that it was difficult for us to play on the tour of Australia in 1999-2000
 shrinkhalaa se pehle aisi baaten hone lagi thi or ek cricketer ke taur par koi yah sunanaa nahin chahta
 Tendulkar said that you want the game to be clean
 main chahta tha ki log hamen andeh kii najar se naa dekhen or khel kaa majaa len
 For this, the mood of the players had to be right, which was not there at that time
 unhone kaha ki hamen match main log taane maarthe the
 i and the whole team felt very insulted
 tendulkar kaa maananaa he ki apni dharti par austrailia ko 2-1 se haraana nirnaayak mode rahaa
 He said that i was sure that with our excellent performance against Australia, cricket lovers will forget about the past and start enjoying the game
 bhagwaan kii krupa se ham aisa kar sake
 Tendulkar said that we lost the first match in Mumbai but won the second match in Kolkata in the same circumstances and equalized in the series
 aakhri match jitkar hamane shrinkhalaa apane naam kii
 This forced cricket lovers to forget that bad chapter
 match phixing ke bhayaavah daur ko yaad karte hue baakar ne bataaya ki dakshin africa board se satorio ne sampark kiya tha
 He said that the bookies had contacted us directly and asked the players in the team meetings to accept their offer
 isisi kii kuch baithkon main maine yah masalaa uthaaya bhi lekin mujhase gavaah or saboot maange gaye
 It was not negotiated
 sadiyon pehle kisi mahanubhav ne pet ko paapi kah diya
 Till date, the stomach has remained such a villain that every world of filling it falls under the category of sin
 bhale hi pet keval ek ang he, jahaan chatori jeebh se hokar khaanaa pahunchataa he or sharir ke baaki angon tak zaruri rasayan ko nichod kar pet hi bhejtaa he
 It means to say that in our world, there is a thinking about anything and then it is impossible to remove that label
 aisa hi ek label bazaar ke maathe par chaspa he
 Before understanding the delicate relationship between the media and the market, some truth has to be accepted
 media samaaj kaa chauthaa stambh hone ke saath- saath ek vyavsaay bhi he
 Students coming out of media schools want to earn roti along with social reform
 media kaa vistaar bazaarwaad ke daur main hi sambhav ho paaya he
 Media freedom has increased with the expansion of media
 lekin iske saath hi taiyaar ho gai he, vah patali-si rekha, jo media ke bazaari or baazaaroo hone kaa fark tay karti he, jahaan khabaren bazaar ke mizaaj se likhi jaati hai, jahaan sponcer ke paison kii khanak, aawaaj kii dhamak tay karti he
 So is the media in the era of marketism losing its credibility
 yaa phir vaaki media par bazaarwaad haaavee ho chukaa he
 What does it mean in the era of marketism and how the media should maintain their independence not only from political ideology but also from the market
 in sawaalon ke jawaab saidhantik hai, unhen vyaavhaarik bananaa maujuuda yug ke media kii sabase badi chunauti he
 The media is such a police station that no one was going to receive the news
 haal ke dinon main media hi chor pakadaney vaali police bana
 Media is the only court to sentence
 nishpaksh rahane kaa paath padhaane vaala media ekatarfa faisle sunaane laga
 Now is it a feeling of being omnipotent or some of the equations in the market where doing so has become a compulsion
 par aaj bhi desh ke sudur konon main baithe log media se nyaay kii aas lagaate hai
 Those who persecute police administration, cheat of politicians, look at the media
 yah media kaa param daayitv he ki un ummiido par khara rahe or media kii tamaam aalochana ke bich bhi agar logon kii vah ummid jinda he, to yah bazaarwaad ke daur main media kii bahut badi uplabdhi he
 Today the media is put in the box of marketism, it is very unfortunate, but at the same time it is equally important
 chunki agar badlaav prakruti kaa niyam he, to sakaaratmak badlaav vakt kaa takaza
 In the context of media, what is marketism? In the early eighteenth century, an advertisement was published in the newspaper for the first time by paying money
 yah ek aise krantikari yug kaa armbh tha, jahaan dhime-dhime chapai ke kharch kii chintaa khatm hone vaali thi
 Journalists could now only worry about their purpose, a means to reach people was found
 aanevaale dashakon main media kaa swaroop jyon-jyon badla, vigyaapan bhi rang-rup badal-badal kar dhalate gayi
 The market expanded
 bazaarwaad kaa janm hua
 The knock of marketism first came upon our feelings, or on our principles, it is a matter of debate, because in the absence of giving time to the child, the parents started giving them a precious toy to compensate for the feelings
 shaayari kii jagah smaili ne le lee
 The shelves started to crack with unnecessary items
 samaaj badal gaya or badalte samaaj ko aainaa dikhaata media bhi badal gaya
 If we go by definition, then the news media we are discussing here, there were allegations of market dominance in the selection of news
 yah mahaj ek ahsaas he yaa hakeekat, is par ham aage charchaa karenge
 First understand the relationship between news media and marketism, especially television news
 tiarapy ek aisa shabd he, jiskaa istemaal dhadlle se hota he, par yah he behad gudh
 TRP shows how many people are watching a channel, in easy terms, without going into the nuances of business
 kisi bhi sho kii tiarapy tay karti he ki vah safal he yaa nahin
 Like sometimes comes the era of action films and sometimes romantic films
 usee tarah kabhi log ajab-gajab news ke sho adhik dekhte hai, kabhi hard polytical dibet
 There is no doubt that every TV news channel gives importance to TRP, because advertisers measure the credibility of the channel with these scores
 lihaaja agar revenue chahie to tiarapy badhanaa zaruri he or tiarapy badhaani he to vah dikhaanaa hoga, jo log dekhnaa chaahate hai, yani ek najariye se dekhie, to bazaarwaad kaa aks nazar aane laga
 The duties of the media were not set anywhere, but the expectation has always been that the news should be shown in which people are concerned, which will benefit the people
 udhaaharan ke taur par kya kangana ranot or ruthik roshan kii chauraahey kii ladaai se kisi kaa bhala judaa he, kya media channelon or akhabaaron ke un bade boses ko yah nahin maaloom, jo kareeb chaar dashak se patrakarita kar rahe hai? kya ladaai se kisi kaa sarokaar hona chahie? jaahir he chaatr hone ke baavjood aapako in sawaalon ke jawaab maaloom honge, par iske vyaavhaarik pahalu ko samajhnaa bhi zaruri he
 The question is why does this happen? If neither has anything to do with it, nor is there any benefit to anyone, then who watches this news? The question gets complicated here because people see this news and see it in large numbers
 live mint ko 2008 main die ek intervyuu main star india ke tatkaaleen mukhiya udai shankar ne patrakarita ke girte str par puche ek sawaal ke jawaab main kaha tha, ‘‘hamen do chizon ke bich bhed karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 The first is whether such reports are being shown intentionally or due to lack of ability and ignorance
 meraa khyal he bhartiya news media main ye donon chunautiyaan maujuud hai
 Not just TV, but also in print
 ’’yah vah daur tha, jab tivi screen par ajab-gajab khabaron kaa bolbalaa tha
 It is clear that people were seeing such news at that time, that is, there was a market for these news
 ab yahaan ek baar phir is baat ko doharaana zaruri ho jaataa he ki bazaar shabd ke ullekh bhar se koi bhi chiz buree nahin ho jaati
 Media is a mirror of society, so the market is also reflective
 aise main yahaan ek nijee anubhav kaa zikr is maamle par prakaash daalane ke liye zaruri he
 There was no television series on India's freedom fighters
 bhagat singh, chandrashekhar azaad ke kisse to sabane sune the, par baadha jatin, prafull chaaki jaise senaniyon kii kahani kamobesh ansuni thi
 Therefore, stories of freedom fighters were narrated on Aaj Tak channel under the show named Vande Mataram
 sho ko aalochakon se badhiya rispance mila, par tiarapy nahin mili
 The series had to be shut down after five shows
 duusari taraf ‘gaanv aaj tak’ naam ke sho main alag-alag gaanv kii samasyaayein, uplabdhiyaan bataayi gayin, par tiarapy tab-tab milti, jab koi tendua, bhaaluu gaanv main ghus aane kii khabar hoti yaa phir marpet kii khabaren hotin
 So what does it mean, people have nothing to do with martyrs or roads, electricity news, no one is benefited by this? Because attempts were made to show 'good' news, but there were few who saw these 'good' news
 sidhi-si baat he, un khabaron kaa bazaar nahin tha
 People were not interested in this
 chaatr hone ke naate aapke man main sawaal uthegaa ki phir bhi hamen karnaa to vahi chahie, jo tay maanakon ke hisaab se sahi ho
 The answer is that no one will listen to you, no matter how true the message is, it cannot fulfill its purpose
 isiilie dikhaaya vahi janaa chahie, jiskaa bazaar ho, par sandesh ke saath chhedchhad bilkul nahin kii jaani chahie
 Even if the market decides the trend of news, the nature of news should never be decided
 tab bazaarwaad kaa daur to rahegaa, par bazaarwaad kabhi media par haaavee nahin ho sakegaa
 Bazaru Vs Bajari If you use social media, being a student of journalism, two words will bother you a lot
 pehla he ped media
 The second is prostitute
 ye shabd har us mediakarmi yaa sanghathan ke liye istemaal kiye jate hai, jin par kisi vichaardhaara ko pryojit karne kaa aarope lagaana ho
 This is the second matter of how right or wrong the allegations themselves are, it is under suspicion
 apane aaropon ko tode jane kaa dard ek dfa tatkaaleen videsh rajyamantri, general (ritred) ve
 K
 singh ne media par prestitute kaa palatwaar karke nikaala tha
 Since then the word has become very popular in Hindustan, but this word is not his invention
 america kii patrika trends jaranal ke prakaashak jerald selent ne prestitute shabd kaa istemaal sabase pehle kiya tha
 According to the Urban Dictionary, "freelance journalists and journalists working in media different from the mainstream, generally use the term Prestitute for those who blindly report in favor of the government or institutions and be fair as journalists
 Does not bear the responsibility of par bharat main is shabd kaa dayera kuch or badhaakar sarkaar ke viruddh khabaren chalaane waalon par bhi ise lagu kiya jaataa he or dhire-dhire yah shabd har us patrkaar yaa sanghathan ke liye istemaal kiya jane laga he, jo kisi ke bhi viruddh khabaren chalaae
 It would not be wrong to say that in today's era, almost every journalist is a marketer in the eyes of some group
 ab ped media ko bhi samaj len
 The context in which paid media is used is inappropriate, as it literally means publicity through advertising, but in India it is used to say that a journalist or organization ran the news with money
 yahaan par yah bhi samaj len ki yah edwartorial kii baat nahin, balki patrakarita main bhrashtachar kaa aarope he
 That is, it is a total fret over the form of media of the public, where it seems that the media has left its principles and become marketable, but during the media discussion in the era of marketism, we have to understand that corruption and marketism is a It is not a matter
 isliye bazaari or baazaaroo kaa fark khadaa hota he
 The marketer is the one who is for sale, who has nothing to do with the values of journalism, the principles, which considers media only business

 duusari ore bazaari vah he, jo bazaar kii samaj se paripurna he
 One who understands the pulse of the public and becomes popular with the public and becomes a favorite of the market
 iske liye vah pryojit khabaren nahin dikhaata, par logon ke sarokaar kii khabaron ko is dilachasp andaaj main dikhaata he ki log usase nazaren nahin pher sakate
 There is only a difference of volume in these two words, but a little manipulation makes a difference of ground and sky
 yahaan sampoorn media nahin, balki alag-alag channelon or akhabaaron ke hisaab se dekhnaa hoga, kyonki pratispardhaa ke is daur main jo bazaari nahin ho paata, vah baazaaroo hone kaa shortkat apana letaa he
 It has been a big dilemma of the region whether the illusion of being associated with the ideology of a party makes any channel or newspaper marketable? Because even though the picture is not clear in India about political leaning, that is, the political leanings of the channel / newspaper, an interesting survey was done in this regard in America
 PEW research centre kii study ne yah jaanane kii koshish kii, ki alag-alag raajnneetik raay rakhane vaale log, kis tivi / media ko dekhte hai
 According to the report, most Conservative-minded people watch Fox News and the Liberals rely on mixed media
 inamen awwal he neuyork times, to kya ise in media kaa pakshpaat samajhen yaa phir dekhne waalon kaa bhram
 Not only in India, a new splash about the media is being seen, but this discussion has been going on in the US for two-four years before marketism
 ‘vhai americans het da media and haau it matters’ main johnathan em
 Lad writes, "an impartial, powerful and widely respected news media is now a matter of history
" 1950 se 1979 ke bich ek aisa daur zarur tha, jab sansthagat patrkaar ganraajya ke shaktishaalee rakshak the, jo raajnneetik samvaad main sarvocch str banaaye rakhte the
 "however, Lad writes further," In most cases one media has to bear the stain of favoritism due to propaganda
 hakeekat isse alag hoti he
 "the responsibility of a media house not being marketable is also on each of its journalists
 jin mulyon or siddhanton ke liye patrakarita jaani jaati he, use lagu rakhana vyaktigat taur par har patrkaar kii zimmedaari hoti he
 It is also important to remember that when any channel or news media falls to such a level that most people in the society start treating it as a market, then its market automatically ends
 is vimarsh kii zarurat kyon ?angreji main kaha jaataa he, ‘dont shoot da massenger’ yani sandesh laane vaale ko mat maaro
 Is there any resentment from the current debate messenger that he is being maligned or has the value of journalism fallen so much that the need for this discussion has arisen
 darasal yug bazaarwaad kaa he, to yahaan zarurat din-raat dikhne kii bhi he or 24 x 7 kii is duniya main har ek minute kuch alag dikhaane kaa dabaav he
 There are many times when political events are silently silent, when something is not going to be so big, in which people will be interested, then the search for news usually brings a few samples, which people see, but there is also plenty of complaint

 The compulsion of not having big news at times also makes the news sense fall into the pit, but the market is ready, otherwise what should be around 24 hours? These were the news which if people really do not like it, then the option to turn off the TV Was present, but no one did it
 chicago booth ke professor jesi em shapiro ne 2010 main apane research paper main likhaa, ‘‘aamtaur par akhabaaron ke lekhon main nazar aane vaali vichaardhaara is baat par nirbhar karti he ki log kya padhanaa chaahate hai
 This is not the personal opinion of newspaper owners
 ’’privet media ke liye safalataa darshak reating par nirbhar he, is baat par nahin ki darshakon ko program acha yaa paryaapt laga ki nahin
 The market only pays attention to media whose trps are high
 is baat se bazaar ko koi lenaa-dena nahin ki amuk channel ko dekhne vaale yaa akhbaar ko padhane vaale log kitne jaagruk, kaarykram kaa vishleshan kitna sateek tha, darshak kitne santusht hue
 Many experts believe that the media forgets to pay attention to the quality of the audience in order to focus on the number of viewers
 media freedom naam kii kitaab ke mutabik, ‘‘khel kii khabaron kii lay-taal, raajnneetik uthaa-patake kaa romaanchak live kawarej, videshon main lade ja rahe yuddh ab ghar kii mahfuj charadivari main uplabdh hai- 80 ke dashak ke ant tak news program main jaankaree or manoranjan ke is mishran ko imphotonment kaha jane laga-’’ aaj imphotonment ke is johnor ko log khabaron ke rup main purnatah sweekaar kar chuke hai
 This aspect is also a product of marketism, but it will be interesting to know how many people connect cricket's entertaining match report or analysis of the ongoing violence in Syria with the market
 hindustan ke darshak videshon kii apeksha adhik udaar hai
 There is also a discussion abroad of such an effect of marketism in the media, which probably Indian audience has accepted without question for years
 is yug main darshakon ko khinchne ke liye media ko ati sarleekaran kaa doshi mana jaataa he
 In her book 'the Interplay of Influence - News, Advertising, Politics and the Internet', Kathleen Hall Jameson writes that TV news is ranked according to one of the five categories
 * dikhaava banaam hakeekat* chota aadmi banaam bada aadmi* achchhai banaam buraai* dakshata banaam aakshamata (chusti banaam susti)* adbhut banaam saadhaarankathalin ke mutabik duniya main sab kuch shwet yaa shyaam kii shrenee main aata he, yah avadharana hi galat he
 It complicates the thinking of the society instead of simplifying it
 media darasal keval ek aisa dhaancha dene kii koshish karata he, jise aasaani se bazaar main bechaa ja sake, jiskaa vyavsaayik istemaal ho sake
 If media and marketism are discussed in India, then it is an attempt to highlight the aspect that the big problems of our country are ignored due to interesting news
 kaise banaaen santulanakya media bazaarwaad ke changul main funs chukaa he, kya khabaron kaa vajood, khabaron kii ahmiyat, keval bazaar ke taraazoo main taule jate hai, kya keval tiarapy tay karti he ki kis khabar ko kis rup main pesh kiya jayega ?ajtak ke managing editor supriy prasad kehete hai, ‘‘din kii jo sabase badi khabar he, vah saare channel kamobesh ek hi vakt par dikhaa rahe hote hai
 There can be many reasons why viewers will come to see that news on your channel
 pehali he, aapke channel kii chhavi, yani agar log aapako sabase tej maanate hai, to unhen maaloom he puri khabar jaanane ke liye kahaan janaa he, par kai dfa khabaron kaa treetment bhi darshakon ko khinchakar apni ore le aata he
 "clearly, when there is a competition for channels to show the news, it is also natural to attract viewers
 is vakt media industry main kya chal rahaa he, ise lekar logon kaa alag-alag akalan he, jo kahin sahi, kabhi bhram se bojhil he, par kya hona chahie- santulan kaise bananaa chahie, yah ahm he
 Positive measures should be tried to make the news interesting
 masalan sansad kii bahes dikhaate hue yadi kaamkaaj kaa lekha-jokha bhi dikhaaya jaae, to khabar ko sandarbh milegaa
 Anything said by a member, if it is in contrast to something said by him in the past, then it will also give a perspective
 aisi chizon ko vailu adishan kaha jaataa he or ye darshakon ke liye dilachasp hone ke saath saath gyanavarddhak bhi hoti hai
 An example of America in the news about bias is also interesting
 2008 main jorge dablue bush ke press secretary scot maikkalilan ne apni kitaab main is baat ko sweekaar kiya ki ve varishton ke nirdesh par niyamit rup se media ko aisi khabaren li kiya karte the, jo puri tarah se sach nahin hoti thim
 The media used to present these reports as a fact
 maikkalilan ne likhaa ki press mote taur par sachai dikhaanaa chahta he or sach ke saath he, par adhiktar patrkaar or network white house kii ji hujuri karte hai
 Probably no leader or politician in India will accept such things with such truth
 yah bhi samajhane kii aavashyaktaa he ki khabar kaa dayera raajnneeti se shuru hokar raajnneeti par khatm nahin hota
 From sports to the military, from films to social issues, all are news
 choubees ghante ke daayre main in sabhi khabaron kaa sateek mishran kai samasyaon kaa nivaaran he
 Difficulty arises when excessive focus is placed on any one type of news
 kisi jurm kaa byora diya jaae, tab tak vah khabar he, par har aadhe ghante par us vaardaat kii baarikiyaan bataanaa kai dfa sansani kii shrenee main chalaa jaataa he
 The media needs to avoid this
 khabaron ko pesh karnaa ek channel main producers kii zimmedaari hoti he, yani script kii bhashaa kisi he, story ko kisi tasveeron, kaise mujeec ke saath pesh kiya ja rahaa he, yah produsar tay karte hai, par santulit rahane kaa bada daayitv reporter par hota he, jo khabar lekar aate hai
 In the era of live TV, there is a big danger that without any well thought out news commentary has to be done
 kisi press vaarta main kahi sau baton main koun-si baat he, jise hilite karnaa he
 The things that the reporter says live, that is, in which there is little time to think and understand, usually leave the idea of the line line of the channel in the mind of the people
 isiilie khabar ko keval ek khabar kii tarah treet karnaa, apana najariya bataane se bachanaa, ye chand aise mantra hai, jin par agar samvaadadaata kaayam rahen, to media pakshpaat ke adhiktar aaropon se apana daaman bachaa paaegaa
 Actually newspapers are editorial to keep the rest of the pages and opinions for the news, but there are also debate shows in twenty four hours TV news channels, where the anchor keeps the opinion while commenting, then after every report on that news It has also become common to make a comment, that means every minute of TV media is now cumbersome from editorial
 santulan kaa ek or pahalu media studies kii buniyadi sikh main shumaar he
 That is, one should not show only one aspect of news
 agar vivaad ho, to har paksh kii baat saamne rakhi jaae
 If anyone refuses to talk, then this thing should also be put in front of the people with clear proof, so that the decision is not given by the channel, but the audience can take it
 misaal ke taur par agar sarkaar apane kisi kaamkaaj ke bakhaan ke taur par koi report pesh kare, to yah reporter kii zimmedaari he ki vah un logon se bhi baat kare, jinke liye kaam karne kaa daawa kiya gaya he
 Even if people are satisfied
 agar log sarkaar ke daavon ko khaarij karte hai, tab bhi, haalanki jhatpat news ke daur main kai dfa in baton ko nazarandaaj kar diya jaataa he
 Failure to get to the depth of the news strikes a deep blow on fairness
 khabaron main santulan koi rocket science nahin he
 It is only necessary that the basic principles of journalism be remembered
 unheen saral siddhanton main santulan kii kunjee he
 In them, in the era of marketism, the whole lesson of being free from the market is captured
 kamai kaa jariyavaicharik azaadi kaa ek bada aadhaar he aarthik azaadi
 Is the Indian media free on this basis? To understand this, we have to understand the business model of news channels and before understanding that model, we also have to see the expansion of news channels in India
 ikkisvin sadi ke pehle dashak main news media ne apratyaashit badhat dekhi
 New laws and regulations were suitable for the market
 license fees kam thi
 Thus, broadcast media saw a sudden surge
 kareeb tees saal pehle, jahaan bharat main ek tivi stesan tha, chand saalon main kai sau channelon kaa vistaar ho gaya
 As of 2013, there were 438 entertainment and 410 news channels in India, according to a report by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting
 haalanki ek taraf channelon kii sankhya bad rahi thi, duusari ore vaishvik mandi or gharelu arthvyavastha kii dhimi chaal media industry ke paanv kaa pathar sabit ho rahe the
 The recession had the opposite effect on advertising revenue and a large number of media workers lost their jobs in a fiercely competitive market
 kai channel band ho gayi, to kai band hone ke kagaar par jhulate rahe
 Funds are required to launch any new channel
 yah fund niveshkon kii shakl main aata he, lekin niveshkon kii bhoomika yaheen khatm nahin hoti, balki aanevaale dedh se do saal tak channel niveshkon par hi nirbhar hota he
 If the channel gradually becomes popular and starts attracting viewers, then in about two years, it breaks even, ie, achieves a situation where there is neither profit nor loss
 iske baad edwartigers aane lagate hai or channel munafa kamaane lagata he
 But this is an ideal situation
 bharat main tivi news channelon kii sankhya itani adhik he ki har ore hode he
 Many channels take more than four years to break even
 na to niveshkon main itnaa sanyam he, na channel main kaam karanevaalon main utana dhairya
 However, in recent years, many such channels were launched in which politicians, builders invested
 kai aise logon ke naam bhi niveshak suchi main dikhe, jinaki kamai kaa jariya hi sandehaaspad tha
 In most cases these people invested money because of their personal need to maintain their agenda
 jaahir he ek channel hi nahin, balki puure bazaar par iskaa prabhaav padaa
 In fact, the control rules of the TV industry are so poor that it is often used for money laundering, so that black money can be white
 aaie, ab ham tivi industry ke bijness model ko samajhen
 In most of the developed TV market, 70 per cent of the revenue comes from subscription and 30 per cent from advertising revenue, but the opposite is true in India even after so many years
 bharat main ek news channel kaa ausatan 95 pratishat revenue vigyaapan se aata he or 5 pratishat cabel sabsakripshan se
 In this too, if there is a large news channel, it gets the convenience of being a pay channel and gets subscription revenue, but in the case of small channels, in many cases the subscription revenue is negligible
 yani antat ladaai tiarapy kii rah jaati he
 If you want to run a channel, then there is a need to prove yourself on the scale of popularity
 kai dfa jab tiarapy kii ladaai bheeshan ho jaati he to channel content ko aise str par le jane ko majaboor ho jate hai, jo keval tivi reating hasil karne ke liye dikhaaya jaataa he
 The big networks save themselves from this struggle, but who has forgotten that era in the TV news industry, when suddenly the sensational news of astonishing and superstitious news took place and more or less all the channels got involved
 isamen koi do raay nahin ki patrakarita loktantr kaa ek mahatvapurn stambh he, par bharat main channelon kaa bijness model unhen zarurat se zyada bazaar par nirbhar kar detaa he
 There are countless problems of news channels here
 sabsakripshan se aamadani na ke baraabar he
 Competition is high and advertisers have many options, ie the bargaining power of revenue is less for channels and more for advertisers
 to kya edwartiging par had se zyada nirbhar hona, news media kii nishpakshta ko kathghare main khadaa karata he ? yahaan nirmal baba ke us daur ko yaad kariye, jab vah chaat-golgappas kii chatnee se gambheer se gambheer samasya kaa ilaaj de dete the
 When the news channels showed this dispute, they used to give ads on almost all the channels
 phir bhi yah khabar dikhaai gai
 Similarly, when news of pastides came out in Coca Cola and Pepsi, both these companies were the biggest advertisers in India
 iske baavjood vivaad ko anjaam tak pahunchaaya gaya
 That is, the business model is on one side and the fairness of the news media on the other side, but the danger of bias cannot be ruled out, plus all these examples cannot be applied to everyone

 The NBA ie News Broadcasters Association is an association of private TV news and current affairs broadcasters
 yah puri tarah se sadasyon dwaara fundad he
 As of May 2016, 23 channels in the country were members of the NBA
 enbie kii website par kaamkaaj kaa vivaran kuch is prakaar he
 "the NBA presents the unified and trusted voice of the industry with the expanding media before the government
" ’’enbie kaa doosraa pahalu he aatm nimantran, jiske liye vah code of athiks and broadcasting standerds ke jariye guidelins jari karata he
 These guidelines are valid for all member channels and they follow it

 Viewers can complain directly to that channel
 agar channel iskaa sangyaan nahin letaa yaa phir channel ke uthaaye kadam se darshak santusht nahin hota, to vah enbie se shikaayat kar saktaa he
 If the channel still does not respond within 14 days, the show can be issued a show cause notice by the NBA
 enbie main jeuri of piers sajaa tay karne kaa adhikaar rakhte hai
 It is a 9-member authority, headed by former Chief Justice (retd) JS Verma
 enbie ke paas adhikaar he galati karne vaale news channelon ko peshi ke liye bulaane kaa
 If the mistake is proved after the hearing, the NBA also has the right to warn
 galat khabar dikhaane yaa enbie ke disha-nirdesh kaa ulanghan karne ke maamle main ukt channel par fine bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he or unhen prime time main apni galati ke liye screen par likhit maafee maangane kaa farmaan sunaaya ja saktaa he
 News24 was forced to apologize on screen through an order dated 18 / 4 / 2012 for being found guilty of running a news promoting superstition
 isi tarah times nau par 11 / 3 / 2016 ke order ke jariye chhedhkhani ke aarope jhel rahe ek vyakti ke pakshpatpurna intervyuu ke liye pachaas hajaar kaa fine lagaaya gaya tha
 It was commented while writing the verdict, "the NBA realizes why the overjoyed media sometimes do injustice in trying to get justice
" iskaa aasaan jawaab he, tiarapy
 "in 8 years, the NBA has given a total of 41 decisions, but there are many news networks in the country who are not members of the NBA
" jo hai bhi, un par ek seemaa tak hi enbie kaa jor chal saktaa he
 Yet the attempt to stop messing with news in the era of marketism is commendable
 par niyantran ek ore he, duusari ore he daayitv
 Fear of punishment for making a mistake will control the quality, there are no two opinions, but now the time has come to take it a step further
 corporate soshal risponsibility kii tarah, media soshal risponsibility ek niyam ke taur par lagu kii ja sakati hai, taaki dilachasp shoj or rosemara kii khabaron ke saath logon ke hit kii khabaron ko bhi utani hi tavajjo di jaae
 For example, the disease of cancer in Punjab's land should not be shown as a special once in a year, but should be brought to its end
 kisi dur-daraaj ke skool main agar bachche bina chat ke khule main padhane ko majaboor hai, to keval sawaal na uthen, parantu javabdehi tay karne tak khabar chale
 It is not that media personnel do not want to do things that will bring a beautiful change in the society, but many times they are forced to face competition, because one channel shows the news of reform and the other sensational news at the same time, then whose loss will be there, Needless to say, but if MSR comes like CSR, then this rule will be applicable to competition too, as well as the audience who question the media
 That only sensational news is shown, that audience will also be judged that if only sensational news is not seen, what is the role of a journalist, a sinner, a journalist, a messenger? Whatever is happening around him, to convey the news to the people, or to tell what is happening, whether it is good or bad
 yah sawaal pechida he, kyonki agar tivi screen par aap ek bahu ko bujurg saas kii nirmam pitayee karte dekhte hai, to ankar kaa sanyam aapako pareshaan kar saktaa he

 Then, journalists should avoid taking a stand in any case, in this era of marketism when every moment of 24 hours a new picture is playing on the channels, straightforward news should be given? Then on live TV, when the instant commentary is going on, who has control over right and wrong and then even more important question is, who should decide the right and wrong? Theoretical explanation of the role of a journalist is not possible because a community To be fair, it would be toxic analysis for another
 jo khabar ek party ko sachhee lagegi, vah duusari party ke liye juthi hogi
 That is why we should return to following basic rules of journalism to avoid the glut of market news

 loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi kii prachand lahar main desh ke kai siyaasi kunbe puri tarah se dhwast ho gaye hai
 In Uttar Pradesh, the country's largest state, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had to face a crushing defeat in his fort Amethi
 vahiin, mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav ko chhodkar 'yadav kunba' puri tarah se dhwast ho gaya he
 Apart from this, Chaudhary Ajit Singh and Jayant Chaudhary, who are inheriting the legacy of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, have not been able to save their seats even after riding alliance with SP-BSP
 uttar pradesh kii siyasat main mulaayam-choudhary charan ke kunba kaa raajnneetik varchasv jagajaahir he
 These two families also have political areas and caste equations, with the help of which they have been showing their strength in the politics of the province
 mulaayam parivaar jahaan yadav-muslim maton ke sahare satta kii dahalij tak pahunchate rahaa he to choudhary charan kaa parivaar jat-muslim sameekaran ke sahare satta kii malai khaataa rahaa
 But, after Narendra Modi's knock in national politics, the equation of both the clans seems to be completely collapsing election after election
 is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main mulaayam parivaar ke 5 sadsy apni paramparaagat seat se chunavi maidan main utre the
 These included Mulayam Singh Yadav from Mainpuri seat, Akhilesh Yadav from Azamgarh, Dimple Yadav from Kannauj, Dharmendra Yadav from Sambhal and Akshay Yadav from Firozabad
 inamen mulaayam singh or akhilesh yadav hi apni-apni seat bachaa paae hai
 While the rest of the Mulayam family members have suffered defeat in the Modi wave
 dilachasp baat yah he ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mulaayam kunba apni siten bachaane main kaamyaab rahaa tha
 The SP had won 5 seats, all these seats belonged to the Mulayam family
 is baar ke chunaav main akhilesh yadav basapa ke saath chunavi sangram main utre the
 It was believed that through the dalit-muslim-yadav equation, the SP would be able to win these seats, but it could not translate into results
 in siton ke nateezon ko dekhen to firozabad seat par ram gopal yadav ke bete akshay yadav kii haar main unke chachaa shivpal yadav kii ahm bhoomika rahi he
 Shivpal, who broke away from the SP and formed a separate party and entered the electoral fray, became an obstacle in Akshay's victory by securing 91869
 bijepi yah seat 28781 se jeet darj kii he
 In this way, Salim Sherwani became the main reason for the defeat of Dharmendra Yadav in the Badaun Lok Sabha seat
 dharmendra yadav ko bijepi kii sanghmitra maury ne 18454 se chunaav haraaya he
 Sherwani has received 51947 votes on this seat
 kannauj loksabhaa seat par akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple yadav chunavi maidan main utari thi, lekin jeet se maharoom rah gai
 From here Dipal Yadav had to face defeat by 12353 votes
 mulaayam parivaar kii tarah se choudhary charan kii viraasat sambhaal rahe choudhary ajit singh kii choudharahat puri tarah se khatm ho gai he
 Ajit Singh joined hands with the SP-BSP to save his political existence
 iske baad bhi ajit singh mujffarnagar seat se or jayant choudhary bagpat seat se haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 Its Jayant Chaudhary was defeated by bjp's Satyapal Singh by 23502 votes and Chaudhary Ajit Singh was defeated by Sanjeev Balyan by 6526 votes
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi baap-bete apni-apni siten nahin bachaa sake the

 In the triple murder case of two brothers and nephews, the Additional Sessions Judge, in his judgment, acquitted 4 people including the BJP MLA accused in the case
 vahiin unke sage gram pradhan bhai samet 5 logon ko aaajeevan karawas kii sajaa sunai
 While the MLA has expressed satisfaction over the decision that came 24 years later, on the other hand (the sons of the dead) have declared this decision unfortunate
 unka kahana he ki is maamle main vidhayak sureshwar singh aaropee the, unhen sattapaksh kaa vidhayak hone kaa laabh mila he, isliye wo chhot gaye hai
 He said that he still has faith in the court and will challenge this decision in the High Court
 iske liye unhone pehle hi hai court main cese transfar kii arji daal rakhi he, jis par sunwaayee aagaamee 11 sitambar ko honi he
 Incident June 29, 1995 On the day of June 29, 1995, the former head of village Sisaiya Chummani of Thane Khairighat, Gokran Singh, along with his brother Amiraka Singh and nephew Bajrangi Singh, were returning to their home by getting a land registry, when the police station of Hardi People sitting in ambush near the village, they were attacked by armed men and gunned down the three with bullets

 After that, the police filed a chargesheet in the court and the trial in the case started
 samay bitne ke saath mukadmaa lanbaa chalaa
 During the trial, 2 of the 11 accused were also killed
 phir court ne 9 logon kaa trial jari rakhaa
 After 24 years, after 24 years, the case passed from this court to the court, but the decision could not be done, but the political personality of the accused MLA Sureshwar Singh in the case went on to rise and for the second time in the year 2017 She managed to become an MLA by winning the election of Mahsi by margin
 vahiin, unke bade bhai brijeshwar singh gram pradhan se chalaang lagaakar block pramukh kii kursi par apni patni ko jitawane main kaamyaab ho gaye
 However, amidst all this political glare, the triple murder case registered against him and his brother has always been a sore throat
 isi bich yogi sarkaar ne vidhayakon se jude aapraadhik maamalon kii sunwaayee elahabaad sthit special court sthanantarit karne kaa aadesh diya, to vidhayak sureshwar singh se judaa ye maamla bhi elahabaad sthanantarit ho gaya
 But the case was transferred to the Sessions Court of Bahraich due to the prosecution of the plaintiff
 shanivaar ko vidhayak sureshwar singh kii kismat kaa faisla jab apper jila jaj pratham kii court se sunaaya janaa tha to subah se hi puri kachhari vidhayak ke samarthakon se pat gai
 The police converted the court complex into a camp in view of the sensitivity of the high-profile case
 maamle main 9 aaropeemaamle ke sabhi 9 aropiyon ke saath vidhayak sureshwar singh dopaher 2 baje adaalat pahunche jahaan adaalat ne unke samet 4 aropiyon ko bari kar diya
 On the other hand, along with his village head brother Brijeshwar Singh, involved in the same case, 5 were sentenced to life imprisonment and 50-50 thousand fine
 is maamle main doshi siddh 5 aropiyon ko adaalat ne police abhiraksha main jail bhej diya
 This decision, which came after 24 years in the triple murder case, created both happiness and sorrow in the mla's family
 is faisle ko durbhagyapurna qaraar dete hue maamle main mritak gokaran singh ke putr vikaas singh ne kaha ki court ne is maamle ke mukhya aaropee ko kaise bari kar diya yah samaj se pare he
 At the same time, Baijnath Singh, the son of the second deceased Amirka Singh in this case, has told the MLA to be associated with the ruling party in this decision, behind the acquittal
 unka kahana he ki wo is maamle ko hoicourt main chunauti denge, kyonki unka abhi bhi nyaay palika main bharosa he

 com / aau4isv6wm World Cup 1983 winner Indian team captain Kapil Dev, Anshuman Gaikwad and Shanta Rangaswamy will decide the fate of these three stalwarts Ravi Shastri & Co
 darasal, bhartiya cricket kaa sanchaalan kar rahi prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) ne agle rashtriya coach ke chayan kaa jimmaa kapil dev kii aguwai vaali tadarth samiti ko saunpa he or is faisle se supreme court se niyukt panel main matbhed ho sakate hai
 The ad-hoc committee consists of former Indian captains Kapil Dev, Anshuman Gaikwad and Shanta Rangaswamy and had earlier appointed WV Raman as coach of the Indian women's team in December
 ek sadsy ne pushti kii ki bisisiai ne purush team kaa mukhya coach chunane ke liye bhi unase sampark kiya he
 Earlier, when the COA had two members, chairman Vinod Rai and former Indian captain Diana Edulji
 inamen se adulji ne mahila coach chayan prakriya ko asanvaidhanik qaraar diya tha
 He said that only the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) can select a coach
 sioe ab teen sadasyeey panel he
 Lt General Ravi Thodge was inducted in February
 lekin siesi ke bhavishya ko lankar gambhir ashankaayen hai, jisamen sachin tendulkar, saurav ganguli or vivies lakshmana shaamil hai
 The COA therefore thought it appropriate to entrust this task to the ad hoc committee
 tendulkar ko jahaan hiton ke takaraav ke aaropon se mukt kar diya gaya he
 At the same time, under the BCCI constitution, Ganguly and Laxman have been asked to choose one of their many roles
 sioe ne haalanki is par abhi koi faisla nahin kiya he
 Kapil Dev and Rangaswamy also come under the clash of interests because according to the BCCI constitution they are also responsible for the formation of a players' union
 bisisiai ne mangalvaar ko mukhya coach sahit purush team ke sahyogi staff ke liye aavedan aamantrit kiye
 The head coach should not be more than 60 years of age and should have experience of playing international cricket for at least two years
 sabhi padon ke liye aavedan karne kii antim tithi 30 july he

 com / beetwh2tdb — BJP Maharashtra (@ bjp4maharashtra) October 13, 2019 pm's rally in Jalgaon Today, Bharatiya Janata Party is in full electoral mode in Maharashtra since Sunday
 siem ne aaj mahajanasampark abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kii isakelawa pradhanmantri narendra modi aaj se maharashtra main chunavi reliyon kaa aagaaj karenge
 PM Modi will address 9 election rallies in Maharashtra
 piem modi apane chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat ravivaar ko bhandara jile ke jalgaanv or sacoli main reliyon se karenge
 He said that the Prime Minister will address election meetings in Akola, Partur in Jalna and Eroli in Thane on 16 October
 iske agle din modi bid ke parali or pune or satara main chunavi reliyaan karenge
 According to information received from BJP, Modi will address the 'grand Finale Rally' in Mumbai on October 18, three days before the election
 aakhir rahul gandhi ko narendra modi par gussa aayaa
 Far from targeting Narendra Modi, till now he did not even take Modi's name in his election speeches
 abhi tak unke nishane par bijepi or uski vichaardhaara hoti thi
 Without naming Modi, of course, Rahul Gandhi accused him many times of distributing and doing politics of hate
 pichley ek hafte se rahul or sonia gandhi ne modi par sidhe hamale bolne shuru kiye hai
 This includes referring to Snoopgate and spying on women and raising questions about their safety
 lekin rahul gandhi ne modi par ab tak kaa sabase tikhaa hamalaa buudhvaar ko bolaa
 According to 'indian Express', on Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi addressed a rally in Balod, Chhattisgarh, saying, "modi wants to become PM
 uske liye wo kuch bhi kar degaa
 He will tear it to pieces
 
 
 
 He will fight each other
 " Rahul Gandhi did not stop here
 unhone bijepi ke andruni maamalon par bhi tippanee kii
 Accused Modi of sidelining leaders like Advani and Jaswant Singh
 rahul ne yah bhi kaha ki bijepi main ek hi vyakti ke haathon main sab kuch diya ja rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi also blamed BJP for Gujarat and Muzaffarnagar riots
 rahul ke ye tevar modi ko lekar congress kii badali ranneeti kii jhalak de rahe hai
 Till now Rahul Gandhi has been presenting his image as a responsible and serious leader in his speeches
 system main rahakar system se lard rahe ek naaraaz yuva ke taur par khud ko pesh karne kii unki koshish party ko ulti padi
 He himself later regretted his statement of tearing down an ordinance issued to protect tainted leaders
 jabaki apane ekmaatr tivi intervyuu main vah modi kaa naam lene se bachate rahe
 He did not give any direct answer even when asked about this repeatedly
 darasal, congress ko samaj main aayaa he ki uske paas modi kaa muqabla karne ke liye koi ranneeti hi nahin he
 Sometimes it is decided to remain silent about Modi in the party, sometimes leaders of the second or third line attack him
 congress ko lagata he ki modi apane par hue har hamale ko palatwaar karne ke liye hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal karte hai
 This has happened in the assembly elections of Gujarat
 khaastaur se 2007 ke chunaav main jab modi ne khud ko 'maut kaa saudagar' bataane vaale sonia gandhi ke bayaan kaa apane hi paksh main jamkar istemaal kiya tha
 The Congress felt that after Modi became the prime ministerial candidate, the only issue in the election would be communalism versus secularism and through this it would be able to polarize Muslim votes in its favor
 lekin modi ne chunaav prachaar main hindutv se jude kisi mudde ko praathamikta nahin di or unhone vikaas, shashan, mahangaai or bhrashtachar ke muddon par upie sarkaar par ek ke baad ek tikhe hamale bole hai
 These are issues on which the Congress is unable to defend itself
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii jama masjid ke imam se mulaakaat or uske baad jari hui 'secular' vot na bantane kii apil se is puure chunaav prachaar ne ek nayaa mode le liya
 It seemed that the Congress is now openly taunting Muslim voters by showing fear of Modi's election in this election, so that they can be polarized in their favor
 uttar pradesh main samaajwaad party or bahujan samaaj party or bihar main nitish kumaar or lalu prasad bhi isi ranneeti ke tahat baar-baar modi par sampradayikta failaane ke aarope laga rahe hai
 BJP also responded to this
 dhruvikaran kii raajnneeti main usne bhi apane pattey khol die
 The 'revenge' statement of BJP general secretary Amit Shah in Muzaffarnagar is part of this strategy, in which the BJP is trying to polarize Hindus
 party ke ranneetikaar ise reverse polarieseshan yaa javaabi dhruvikaran kehete hai
 Issues such as the Ram temple, Article 370 and the Uniform Civil Code were reintroduced in the party's manifesto
 chhattisgarh kii raily main rahul gandhi ne modi ke bare main jo bhi kaha he, usase congress kii yahi ranneeti saaf hoti he
 It is the same allegations of splitting, fighting each other, that have been accusing Modi since the 2002 Gujarat riots
 vidambnaa yah he ki jab-jab modi kii sampradayik chhavi ko lekar sawaal uthaae gaye, gujarat main unhone iskaa phayda uthaaya
 Now the question is, what will happen after Rahul's latest attacks? How does Modi answer this? And will this campaign be back on track in this election, deviated from the real issues? loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan pashchim bengal main jo raajnneetik hinsa kii chingaari bhadki thi vah abhi tak nahin buji he
 As the news of violence in Bengal continues to emerge, the war between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) is intensifying
 ab bijepi ne mamata banerjee ke istife kii maang kar di he, to vahiin rajya main pradarshan bhi jari he
 If the BJP celebrated Black Day in the state on Monday, there are plans to perform at many places in the state on Tuesday as well
 bijepi aaj kolkata main pradarshan karegi, jisamen netaa police headquarter tak march karenge
 BJP has alleged that 84 people have died in the state so far, although TMC says the situation is fine in the state
 rajya main mache is raajnneetik vivaad ke bich somvaar ko hi rajyapal kesarinath treepathi ne pradhanmantri narendra modi, grih mantri amit shah se mulaakaat kii
 Before the meeting, there was speculation that the meeting could discuss the deteriorating law and order in the state and the matter could reach President's rule
 haalanki, rajyapal ne baad main bataaya ki is tarah kii koi baat nahin hui he, ye sirf ek shishtachar mulaakaat thi
 In such a situation it would not be right to speculate
 bengal ke 24 pargana main sthiti us din bigadi jab jhande ko lekar hui bahes ke baad kuch kaaryakartaaon kii maut ho gai thi
 These included both BJP and TMC workers
 loksabhaa chunaav se jari he ladyloksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan tiemasi or bijepi main jubaani jang tej thi
 Here, the entire BJP including PM modi-amit Shah were attackers on TMC, while Mamata Banerjee was also reversing
 sirf bade netaa hi nahin balki kaaryakartaaon ke bich bhi chunavi jang chal rahi thi
 Several activists were killed during polling, indigenous bombs were fired in polling booths
 bhaajapa ne aarope lagaaya ki mamata banerjee rajya main loktantr kii hatya kar rahi hai
 This statement of BJP is still going on
 haalanki, chunaav khatm hone ke baad bhaajapa or bhi aakraamak ho gai he
 Continuing to include TMC supporters and workers in his party on his behalf
 to vahiin, bijepi ke bengal prabharee kailash vijayawargeey ne kah diya he ki aisa hi chalata rahaa to ham bengal main raashtrapati shashan lagane kii maang karenge
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP increased its land mass substantially in Bengal
 42 loksabhaa siton vaale bengal main ab tiemasi ke paas 22, to vahiin bijepi ke paas 18 siten hai
 This is the reason that the preparations for Mission 2021 have started from both political parties

 During the hearing, the ED bluntly stated in the Supreme Court that she also wanted to arrest Karti Chidambaram
 bas protection hatate hi karti ko giraftaar kar liya jayega
 During the hearing, Kapil Sibal said that p Chidambaram had become kingpin due to Karthi's father
 bete ne agar aparaadh kiya to kya pita ko jail bhej dena chahie? idi vasihat ko record par kyon nahin laayaa?nyaayik hiraasat main 100 din pureshaidh ne supreme court ko selcovar main do note die hai
 Now the Supreme Court will decide whether to grant bail to p Chidambaram in the ED case in the INX Media case
 sibiai cese main chidambaram ko pehle hi jamaanat mil chuki he
 Even in the ED case, if the Supreme Court grants bail to Chidambaram, then he will come out of jail
 chidambaram ko police yaa nyaayik hiraasat main rahete hue aaj guuruuvaar ko 100 din puure ho chuke hai
 Earlier, the hearing started in the Supreme Court on the bail plea of former Home and Finance Minister p Chidambaram, then Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that on behalf of Chidambaram it has been said that he is not a Ranga badge, so why are he being kept in jail
 iskaa jawaab ye he ki is aparaadh kii gravity samaaj par impact daalati he
 The common man's trust with the system will end
 chidambaram prabhaavshaalee vyaktih tusharasolicytor general mehta ne aage kaha kiaropee vitt mantri ke padaper the
 He is a very influential person
 hamaare paas yah dikhaane ke liye dastavej he ki vah bahut mahatvapurn gavaahon par paryaapt niyantran rakhte hai, chaahe vah hamaari hiraasat main ho yaa nahin
 Tushar Mehta said that documentary evidence indicated that e-mail was being exchanged on behalf of the accused
 aaropee kii benami sampatti desh ke baahar mili he
 They were either part of money laundering or the owners of companies
 solicytor general (SG) tushaar ne aage kaha ki vidash main shell company keval len-dein ke liye bani hui thim
 In this, the accused were directly connected
 ham isko hi sabit karne ke saboot juta rahe hai
 Shell or a proxy company was on paper
 videsh main aisi companiyaan banaai gai thi
 Investigations were made about companies made especially abroad
 upi main jeet ke baad bijepi ab ye jataane kii koshish main he ki ab musalamaanon ko bhi usase parhez nahin rahaa
 Even though the BJP has been accused of polarization in UP and the party's image is being called anti-muslim by making Yogi Adityanath the chief minister, but the BJP argues that this time the BJP has also got the votes of the Muslims of UP
 isi ko bhunaate hue ab dilli me emsidi chunaav se pehle bijepi duusari partiyon ke muslim netaaon ko apane paale main karne main juty he
 Hundreds of Muslims were greeted with drums in the bjp's Delhi office on Friday
 purvi dilli ke saansad mahesh giri or dilli bijepi ke adhyakshamanoj tiwari kii maujuudagi main congressor aam aadmi party ke tamaam muslim netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ne bijepi jwine kii
 Two days ago, Muslim leaders from the Aam Aadmi Party at Manoj Tiwari's house were inducted into the party
 abraar choudhary, wasim saifi, javed khan, yusuf jamaal, javed choudhary, fariyaad khan, asad khan, rajat khan, rais khan jaise naamon kaa jor-shor se elaan dilli bijepi alpsankhyak morcha ke adhyaksh aatif rashid ne kiya or inke bijepi main shamali hone kii ghoshnaa kii
 According to Atif Rashid, in the name of BJP, Muslims have been scared for years, they were shown the fear that if BJP comes to power, it will eat Muslims, but all this was done to garner the votes of Muslims but now decided after the Modi government came It has become that if the development of Muslims happens, it will be under BJP rule
 aatif rashid ne aarope lagaaya ki ab yogi ke naam par daraaya ja rahaa he, lekin ab musalamaanon ko koi bargala nahin saktaa or bijepi main lagaataar shaamil ho rahe musalmaan isaki misaal hai haalanki manoj tiwari se jab ye poocha gaya ki kya emsidi chunaav main musalamaanon ko tikat diya jayega, to unhone inkaar to nahin kiya, lekin sawaal par chuppi saadh gaye

 Was the name of general ashfak parvej kiyani ke baad pakistani sena ke nae pramukh leftinent general raahil sharif honge
 Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced this on Wednesday
 general sharif pakistan ke pradhanmantri ke parivaar ke kareebi maane jate hai
 Apart from this, he is also called the right hand of the current General Kayani
 iske alaava piem sharif ne leftinent general raashid mahmud ko joint chif aaf staff cameti kaa pramukh banaaya gaya he
 President Mamnoon Hussain has given his approval to both appointments
 piem or kayaani, donon ke kareebi hai nae janaralaleftinent general sharif 61 varshiya general ashfak parvej kiyani kaa sthaan lenge jo chah saal tak sena kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baad shuukravaar ko sevanivrutt hone ja rahe hai
 Lieutenant General Sharif is the brother of Shabbir Sharif, who won the country's prestigious nishan-e-haider honor for his gallantry, who was killed in a war with India in 1971
 bataaya jaataa he ki sharif ke purv sena pramukhon or shisharsth adhikariyon ke saath hi lahore kii siyasat main gaharaa dakhal rakhane waalon se bahut achche tallukaat hai
 Mahmood has a good relationship with the Nawaz family and is one of Kayani's confidants
 unhen kayaani kaa dahinaa haath kaha jaataa he
 Lt Sharif earlier also met the commander of Gujranwala Corps, Commander of Pakistan Military Academy Kakul and General Officer Commanding Lahore
 udhar leftinent mahmud ne lahore ke kor commander ke taur par apni sevaayen di hai or vah purv raashtrapati rafique taraar ke sainya sachiv bhi rahe hai
 Mehmood belongs to the Baloch Regiment and has served under General Kayani as Deputy Director General of ISI
 donon general ko leftinent general haaron islam par tarjeeh di gai he, jo is samay kayaani ke baad sabase varisht general hai or logisticks staff ke pramukh hai
 He is scheduled to retire in April
 kayaani ko purv sainik shaasha general parvej musharraf ne 2007 main sena pramukh ke taur par chunaa tha
 He was given an unprecedented three-year extension in 2010 by Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Jilani
 apane general se do baar dhokhaa kha chuke hai sharifpakistani sena pramukh ko chunanaa asainik sarkaar ke liye aasaan kaam nahin he or is maamle main do baar dhokhaa kha chuke sharif ke liye to bilkul nahin
 This is the fourth time that Sharif has selected an army chief
 unhone 1993 main abdul wahid kaakar ko sena pramukh banaaya, lekin unhone sharif ko dhokhaa de diya or ek samay to aisa aayaa, jab unhone sharif ko istife ke raste tak le jane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Kakar was preferred over at least four senior generals
 1998 main sharif ne kam se kam do generalon par parvej musharraf ko tarjeeh di, lekin unhone 1999 main kargil sangharsh kii sajeesh rachane ke saath hi usee saal pradhanmantri ke khilaaf baghawat ko hawa di
 In October 1999, Sharif chose Ziauddin Batt, but could not take the oath because of Musharraf's rebellion
 naye sena pramukh ko aise samay main kaarybhaar saunpa gaya he, jab afghanistan se videshi senaayen waapas laut rahi hai or pakistani taliban tathaa navaj sharif sarkaar ke bich baatcheet kaa khel chal rahaa he
 Along with the government's diplomatic betting with India, they have to take a close look at the relationship with the US, China and Gulf countries and face many challenges on the domestic front as well

 The Committee of Administrators (COA) has decided on Thursday that no officials and CEO will be part of the cricket committee meeting henceforth
 ab tak chayan samiti ko apane faislon main sachiv ko loop main lenaa padataa tha, lekin sioe ne faisla kiya he ki ab aisa nahin hoga
 The Cricket Board of India (BCCI) officials are now angry over this decision of COA
 bisisiai ke ek senior adhikari ne ieenes se kaha ki kya sioe ko abhi tak samvidhan ke niyamon ke bare main pataa nahin he? kya samiti ne khud jo samvidhan banaaya he use samajhane main unhen ek saal kaa samay lagegaa
 The official said, "the new constitution of BCCI has been observed by the Supreme Court and hence it is necessary that it should be followed
" ise panjikrut kiye takreeban ek saal kaa samay ho gaya he, lekin sioe ke liye abhi yah savera kyon hua he? aisa kya hua jisane unhen jagaa diya? kya unhen nahin pataa ki board main kya ho rahaa he?'adhikari ne kaha ki agar savindhan kaa paalan hona chahie to adhikariyon ko bhi nae niyamon ke hisaab se kaam karne dena chahie
 The official said, "will they also let the officers work under the new constitution or do they just want to stop them
" nae samvidhan ke mutabik adhikari vahi hai jo purv main sheersh parishad kaa hissaa rah chuke hai, or agar sioe sochati he ki vahi sheersh parishad he, to aise main adaalat dwaara niyukt kiye gaye adhikari baithak main hissaa le sakate hai
 'he said,' It is clear that according to the new constitution, officers are prohibited from working, in such a situation it is adopting the 'pick and choose' policy by the COA
 'ek or adhikari ne is baat ko aage badhaate hue kaha ki, 'agar aap anya muddon ko dekhen to, cricket samiti ke gathan kii taraf koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya he jis par chayan, koching, team ke pradarshan ko parakhane kii jimmedaari he wo bhi bisisiai ke nae samvidhan ke niyam 26 ke tahat, lekin is par abhi tak dhyaan nahin gaya he
 You will see the COA only working on such issues
 isliye sioe khud bisisiai ke samvidhan ko maan nahin rahi he
 "he said," In the context of the Cricket Advisory Committee (COA), the Supreme Court has empowered the COA to discuss the appointment of selectors with the CAC till the elections are held, which clearly means working till the CAC elections
 Will continue and after that the new CAC will be formed in the AGM, two new selection committee will be elected, but we know what is happening
 'sioe ne kaha he ki chayan samiti ko kisi bhi tarah ke chayan ke liye sachiv yaa siio kii jarurat nahin he
 Convenors can also call the selection committees and not the secretary
 sioe ne haalanki videsh dauron ke liye kach chhot di hai jinke mutabik, administrative manager par baithak kii jimmedaari hogi

 (input language) pakistan or america ke sambandhon main tanatani lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Pakistan has postponed military and intelligence cooperation with the US following allegations by US President Donald Trump
 islamabad main mangalvaar ko institute of stratsic studies ke kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue pakistan ke raksha mantri khurram dastagir khan ne isaki jaankaree di
 Explain that Trump had targeted Pakistan by tweeting in the first week of January
 unhone kaha tha ki pakistan ko suraksha sahaayta raashi ke taur par baari madad ke baavjood america ko dhokhe or jhooth ke sivaa kuch nahin mila he
 Addressing a seminar titled 'structure of Pakistan's security environment', Khan said that the US is going to lose in Afghanistan rather than spend millions of dollars
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki america afghanistan main apni haar ke liye pakistan ko bali kaa bakra bana rahaa he
 Khurram Khan said, 'pakistan does not want to pay any price for its sacrifice, but we want it to be recognized
 ' unhone aage kaha ki pakistan is baat kii ijaajat nahin degaa ki afghanistan kii ladaai pakistan kii jameen par ladi jaae
 He also said that the US is busy accusing Pakistan, rather than providing help to secure the pakistan-afghanistan border
 islamabad sthit america duutavas ne kaha he ki use pakistan kii ore se military ko-oparation ke sthagit kiye jane kii jaankaree nahin mili he
 According to Don's report, US Embassy spokesman Richard Nelzair said, "we have not received any formal information
" 'ek sawaal ke jawaab main dastagir khan ne kaha ki 2011 main salaala check post par hamale ke baad afghanistan ke liye nato supplai rokkar pakistan ne uchit kadam uthaaya tha
 However, he clarified that Pakistan will not take any such step following the alleged allegations of Trump, but will wait for the right time
 pakistani rakshaamantri ne kaha ki iran, china or rus jaise desh america kii tarah is kshetra ke liye mahatvapurn sahyogi hai
 Let me tell you that this statement of Khan is to seal the statement of Pakistan Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif in which he indicated that the time of Pakistan's bilateral relations with America is over
 is hafte kii shuruyaat main asif ne wal street general ko die ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki sahyogi desh is tarah se vyavhaar nahin karte hai
 He also said that Washington is making Islamabad a scapegoat for its failures in Afghanistan
 pentagon ne somvaar ko kaha tha ki washington ne pakistan ko bataa diya he ki karodon dollar kii suraksha sahaayta raashi paane ke liye islamabad ko kya karnaa hoga
 Pentagon spokesman Colonel Rob Manning had said that our expectations from Pakistan are clear and clear
 taliban, hakkaani leader or hamale kii yojana banane waalon ko pakistan kii jameen par sharan nahin milani chahie
 The deteriorating relations between Pakistan and America tell that on the occasion of New Year, Washington has increased pressure on Islamabad and asked to take more stringent measures against terrorism
 washington ne yah saaf kar diya he ki trump ke 'jhooth or dhokhe' ke aaropon ke baad pakistan ko suraksha sahaayta raashi roka janaa america kii dakshin asia stratji kaa ahm hissaa he
 This move of the US is being seen as the initial steps to impose stringent economic sanctions on Islamabad in Pakistan
 haalanki donon deshon ke bich tanatani ke baavjood america or pakistan ke adhikariyon ke bich sampark bana hua he
 US Defense Secretary James Mattis said on Friday that despite the postponement of military aid, the Pentagon maintains communication with Pakistani military installations
 udhar pakistan kii videsh sachiv tahmeena janjua ne kaha ki islamabad, washington ke saath jitna sambhav ho sakegaa, sampark banaae rakhega
 Because America is not only global power, but also has its presence in the region
 or pakistan ke liye vah ek padosi kii tarah he

 Dhoni used to have long hair before
 unke lambe baalo ke prashansak pakistan ke purv raashtrapati general musharraf bhi the lekin ab unhone lambe baalo ko katwa diya he
 There is an interesting story about Dhoni
 wo pehle footbal khilaadi hua karte the or golkeeper kii bhoomika nibhaate the
 He first played cricket when his football coach sent him to play cricket at the local cricket club
 iske baad dhoni cricket main wicketiper kii bhoomika nibhaane lage or sabhi ko prabhavit kiya
 When he performed brilliantly in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship in 1997-98
 iske baad dhoni ne apane cricket par dhyaan dena shuru kiya
 For the first time in international cricket, Dhoni started playing against Bangladesh in 2004
 dhoni kii aakraamak ballebaaji style or unke lambey baalo ne unhen cricket ke chaahane waalon kaa chaheta bana diya
 Since then, he has been known as an important player of Team India consistently

 'he said,' To be honest, i think anyone can win if there is a flat pitch
 kaaphi ran banenge, yah ballebaaji wicket he
 Bowling must be done and there should be discipline in bowling
 kshetrarakshan pahalu ahm hoga
 Mithali said, "there will be no change in wickets in both innings but fielding will play a key role
 pichley saal hamane westeindies kaa daura kiya tha
 We were defeated in odis
 unki team main prayek saal sudhaar ho rahaa he
 He has some good players and some aggressive batsmen
 ’westeindies team main spinner anisa mohammad kii maujuudagi ke bare main poochne par mitali ne kaha, ‘anisa ne bharat main khilaaf hameshaa wicket liye hai
 He has always taken two or three wickets against India
 ’ anisa ne isisi mahila vishwa cap kwalifire 2011 ke final main pakistan ke khilaaf 14 ran dekar saat wicket chatkaaye the
 Talking about the advantages of being a host team, Mithali reiterated that his position will be heavier than the other teams only in terms of circumstances
 unhone kaha, ‘mejabaan desh hone ke naate hamen sirf itnaa phayda he ki hamen halaat kii behatar jaankaree he
 During practice matches we saw that the wickets are flat
 yah ballebaajon ke anukool hai or 250 se 300 se adhik score tak ban sakate hai
 Mithali said, "I think the ICC has provided batting wickets to make a lot of runs in the tournament

 com / eoog1tyxzv chunaav ke thik pehle dost se dushman bane shivasena or bhartiya janata party ke dil ek baar phir se milte dikhaai dene lage hai
 There are signs of softness from both BJP and Shiv Sena
 ye baat alag he ki ab maahaul alag he, sthitiyaan alag he
 After the election, the Shiv Sena has clearly seen its place
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki uddhav thakare ne apane do doot dilli darbar main baatcheet ke liye bheje hai
 Shiv Sena asked for the post of Deputy CM, Shiv Sena has given the command to Anil Desai and Subhash Desai to talk to the upcoming government

 It is believed that in this conversation, the situation of Shiv Sena in the government will be discussed
 mana ja rahaa he ki isi mulaakaat ke maddenjar grahamantri rajnath singh ne apni mumbai yatra radd kii he
 Rajnath Singh made it clear on Tuesday itself that the meeting which was to be held on Tuesday in the presence of central observers, will now take place after Diwali
 jaahir he donon ore se narmi ke sanket hai
 However, sources indicate that the Shiv Sena wants the government to form on that formula of the 1995 alliance
 is formule ke mutabik bade dal kaa mukhyamantri or chote dal kaa up mukhyamantri bananaa tay kiya gaya tha
 Also, ministries like Home, Finance, Irrigation, PWD and Rural Development were also mentioned in the Shiv Sena account
 lekin ab ke halaat main shivasena kii kitni baat maani jaaegi, iskaa sanket bhi om maathur de chuke hai
 He had said, 'the formula of 1995 was given, so neither we were nor Uddhav
 samajhadaar vartmaan sthiti ko dhyaan rakhata he
 'the talks are going to start with the Shiv Sena, but the bjp's stand is clearly indicating that they no longer need the Shiv Sena as much as the Shiv Sena has
 saaf he ki siyasat ke is sameekaran main shivasena agar maharashtra kii satta main bhagidaari chaahati he to use sir jhukaa kar bijepi kii baat manani hogi

 With the Jananayak Janata Party (JJP), which came out of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and came into existence on Friday, the Chautala family has come to a complete standstill with the announcement of its first list of seven candidates
 haalanki khap panchayatein pichley kai dinon se abhaya singh chautaala or dushyant singh chautaala ke bich khadi siyaasi divaar ko giraane kii kavayad kar rahi thim
 Despite the authorization of Khap panchayats by INLD chiefs Om Prakash Chautala and Abhay Singh Chautala, no political solution could be arrived at despite the mediation of former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal
 iske saath hi saaf ho gaya he ki ab chautaala parivaar raajnneetik taur par ek nahin ho saktaa he
 Explain that in view of the efforts being made for the solidarity of the Chautala family, a meeting was held on Saturday at Jat Bhawan in Rohtak
 isamen khap pratinidhiyon ne chautaala parivaar ko ekajute karne ke liye tanabana buna or sarvasammati ke saath ek prastaav paas kiya tha
 However, after this JJP leader Dushyant Chautala made it clear that the Chautala family cannot be one in politics
 dushyant ne kaha ki choudhary ajay singh chautaala ne spasht kar diya he ki vah pariwarik taur par ek ho sakate hai, lekin raajnneetik taur par kabhi nahin mil sakate hai
 On the question of uniting the Chautala family of Khap leaders, the former MP said that no one stood with us when we were expelled from the INLD
 agar parivaar ko ek karne kii baat he to inelo supremeo omprakash chautaala jahaan bhi bulaayenge ham chale aaenge
 But when the JJP made its existence in politics, the Khap leaders are remembering to unite the family
 isse pehle kabhi unhone hamaari khabar nahin lee
 However, before the Khap Panchayat, Dushyant Chautala had cleared his intention by releasing the list of his seven candidates on Friday
 iske baad bhi khap panchayaton ne baithak kii or sarvasammati ke saath prastaav paas kiya gaya tha

 iske saath hi chautaala parivaar kii ekajutata ko lekar jo muhim shuru kii gai thi use khap panchayat ne bhi khatm kar diya he
 Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai is witnessing tremendous drama these days
 in dinon chal rahe plot main dikhaaya ja rahaa he ki karthik naira kii saxes se khush nahin hai
 Karthik is jealous of Naira's success
 isi ke saath wo naira par extra marital afaire kaa aarope bhi lagayegaa
 Fights between them are being shown daily on the show

 But Naira gets a shock when Karthik asks her if she does a one-night stand with her Mihir
 baad main karthik ko raahat mili jab use mihir kii lover mitali ke bare main pataa chalaa
 In the coming days it will be shown that Karthik and Naira will go on a date and someone will kidnap them

 Naira will become the mother of a child after the leap
 sho ke bare main baat karen to ye sho 2009 main shuru hua
 The show was earlier based on the characters of Hina Khan and Karan Mehra
 kuch saalon baad sho unke bacchon par foks ho gaya
 Now Shivangi Joshi and Mohsin Khan play the lead roles
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki aane vaale dinon main naira or karthik ke rishte main kitne utaar-chadhaav aate hai

 It is said that movies are a mirror of life, they take the audience into a world of 70 mm which is completely different from reality
 filmein insaan kii phantasy kaa jariya hai
 Whether it is from any section of society or any society or any age, therefore, filmmakers also target people and make films
 lekin filmon kii kamyaabi kaa koi tay formula nahin he
 The youth have been the first choice of filmmakers in every era
 saath hi, filmein banane main mahilaon or haalia daur main bani bagban film kii safalataa main bujurgon kaa bada haath tha
 Some of today's young filmmakers are making films by choosing a story or a subject to attract the youth
 yuva varg se unka matlab 18 se 32 kii umr ke log hai
 Eudley Films and Criars Entertainment are especially involved in making films that can appeal to the youth
 eudli films kaa dhyey he acchhee kahani, kam bajet or zyada phayda, jabaki crorj ke liye bhi acchhee kahani hi zyada myne rakhti he or yahi vajah he ki unki 18 karod ru
 'S budget film Toilet - Ek Premkatha earned Rs 215 crore
 kaa bijness kiya
 It is not the only film to have a high-grossing budget
 chote bajet kii or bhi filmein hai jinhone box offis par kamaal kiya he
 The film Hindi Medium starring Irrfan Khan has a budget of Rs 23 crore
 tha or isane 102 karod ru
 Earned
 vivaadon main rahi lipstick under maay burka kii laagat chah karod ru
 And had a business of 28 crores
 tak rahaa
 The film Bareilly Ki Barfi starring Ayushmann Khurrana, Rajkummar Rao and Kriti Sanon is also worth Rs 20 crore
 main bani lekin isane bhi ab tak 55 karod ru
 Have done more business than ayushmaan khurana or bhoomi pednekar kii jodi vaali film shubh mangal saavdhaan kaa bhi bajet 25 karod ru
 He is also a business of Rs 50 crore
 tak pahunch gaya he
 Out of these, Akshay Kumar's name can be taken as a big star in toilet-ek Prem Katha
 baaki sabhi filmon main unka star vishay hi he, aisa kaha ja saktaa he
 "now Hindi cinema is changing," says Prerna Arora, the creator of toilet-ek romance
 darshakon ko ghisi-pity kahani se phuslaaya nahin ja saktaa
 There should be some newness in the film, the script is tight, we have to make films taking care of the audience's choice
 " prerana se sahmati jataate hue saaregama india ke vaais president or eudli films ke pramukh siddharth kumaar anand bhi kehete hai, ''chote bajet kii filmon ne box offis par jo karishma dikhaaya he, usase jaahir hota he ki film kaa hero script hoti he or us par hamen gambhirtha se kaam karnaa hoga
 "filmmakers who consider the script as a hero are now turning to specific audiences
 kuch film production companiyaan hai jo research karke khaas umr ke darshakon ke liye filmein banane par dhyaan de rahi hai
 Prerna told, "I am making such films under the banner of my company, Criars Entertainment, which will especially attract the youth
" yuvaaon kii taraf meraa zyada jhukaav isliye bhi he ki main khud yuva hum
 i stepped into the industry at the age of 27 and in the very first year i have given successful films like Rustom and toilet-ek Prem Katha
 in do filmon se hamane lagbhag 300 karod ru
 Has done more business than yah sach he ki meri donon filmon main akshay jaise bade star hai, lekin dhyaan se dekha jaae to donon filmon kii asli star to script hi he
 Vipul K
 for Rustom
 rawal ne or toilet-ek prem katha ke liye garima-siddharth ne behtareen script likhi he
 Akshay is a sellable face
 saath hi unase hamen marketing main bhi bada sahyog mila
 "on the other hand, Saregama India managing director Vikram Mehra says," We have decided after research that films are made for people between the ages of 18 to 32 under the banner of Yudley Films
 in filmon main hamaari pehali praathamikta script hi he
 The low-budget films that have been made this year, we are making films in even lower budgets
 hamaari filmon main koi star nahin he
 The audience of the age group we have targeted will like our films
 "prerana ke bijness partner arjuna en
 Kapoor is also young and his entire focus remains on the script
 ye donon yuva bollywood main halchal paidaa kar rahe hai
 "we are firm businessmen," says Prerna
 isliye jin filmon main paise laga rahe hai, uski relies se pehle hi kamai kar lenaa chaahate hai
 Before the construction of Rustom, we had researched how interested people are about its story and its court case
 pehle yah film jon abraham karne vaale the, par unke inkaar ke baad hamane akshay kumaar ke saath film banaai
 Its success and Akshay's punctuality forced us to create toilet-ek Prem Katha
 " idhar eudli ke pramukh siddharth bhi kehete hai, ''ab samay aa gaya he ki aap kam bajet main filmein banaaen
 Keep the story a hero and big stars are not necessary, but it is important that the actors working in the film should act
 " saaregama india ke emdi vikram maanate hai, ''bade star kii vajah se script peeche rah jaati he
 But if the story has power, we are ready to take the risk
 "dehradun kii rahane vaali prerana kahati hai, ''main chote shahar se ai hum
 So i am aware of the problems of common people, but there is no focus on it in cinema
 hamane toilet kii samasya ko uthaaya
 Actually i have a desi mind and i am using the same in my film business
 ham script kaa chayan soch-samajhakar karte hai
 In this people of today's society and see their problems
 meri aane vaali film roshni ke hero shahid kapur hai
 Power problem has been raised in this
 hamane isaki script bhi garima-saddhirth se likhavai he jinhone toilet-ek prem katha likhi thi
 It will be directed by Srinarayan Singh, who was the editor of Rustom
 ham script par bhi paise kharch kar rahe hai
 In the industry, script writers never got even a lakh rupees, but we got 20 lakh rupees
 tak de rahe hai
 This is because the script is the life of the film
 hamaari ek film phanne khan he jisamen ek solah saal kii ladki apane motaape ko lekar pareshaan he
 It stars Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anil Kapoor
 ham jon abraham ke saath parmaanu bana rahe hai jo pokaran par aadhaarit he
 "vikram says," We made many expensive films like Godmother
 lekin ab ham eudli films ke binar tale chote bajet kii hi filmein bana rahe hai
 Just as we give royalty to songs, we will give royalty to films
 hamane apane film nirmaan ke niyam or bajet tay kar rakhaa he
 We do not have to show hero romance in films
 aaj ke yuva darshakon ko story chahie, star nahin
 We are filming for the age group of 18 to 32
 aaj ke yuva ko aisi story chahie jise vah khud ko rilate kar sake
 Therefore, we have also made a team of seven-eight youths between 18 to 32 years of age to choose the script, which includes youth of every religion
 iske leader charchit script riter anjum rajathali (drohakaal, da lijend of bhagat singh, raajnneeti fame) hai
 "yudley Films chief Siddharth said," Our script team has read 700 scripts in a year but only 15 scripts have been selected and films are being made on them
 ham har bhashaa main film bana rahe hai
 We have to complete and release the film every six months
 "ek kisaan virindra aroda kii beti hai prerana
 But he has inherited the path of entertainment
 unke naanaa kaa apana sarkas tha jiskaa naam kamala sarkas tha jiske shares baad main apollo sarkas ko bech die gaye
 Seeing Prerna's love for films, her father sold the farm and gave her money so that she started her own film production business
 prerana kahati hai, ''maine bhi apane ghar main bete or beti ke bhedbhaav ko dekha he
 We have two sisters
 meraa koi bhi bhai nahin he
 That is why i am doing work that will make my family feel that the daughter is no less than the son
 meraa filmon kaa vyavsaay partnership ke rup main he
 Apart from Akshay, John, Anushka Sharma is making films with me in partnership
 anoushka film pari bana rahi hai
 It is also for the youth and the story it contains has not been seen in films before
 agar yah film darshakon ko pasand ai to shaayad horer filmon kaa chalan ek baar phir shuru ho jayega
 The film Kedarnath starring Sushant Singh Rajput and Sara Ali Khan is also Youth Oriented
 " prerana ne bataaya ki ve akshay ke saath do or filmein bana rahi hai
 There is a thriller film with John, then a comedy drama with Vishal Bhardwaj starring Kriti Sanon and Nawazuddin Siddiqui in the lead
 iske alaava irfan khan or deepika padukon ko lekar banane vaali film kaa nirdesan casting diarector hani trehan kar rahe hai
 Vikram Mehra explains, "the theme of the films under the banner of Udli Films is quite different
 ek taraf kashmir film main aath saal ke bachche kii kahani he jiske pita kaa apharan aatankwaadiyon ne kar liya he or ve unhen khojataa he
 So on the other hand, romance shows a girl with white stains from a radio jockey
 ek tamil film he jisamen ek aise jode kii kahani he jo samaaj ke hisaab se to pati-patni hai, par baad main pataa chalata he ki ve bhai-bahan hai
 Ajji is a touching film
 isamen rape kii shikaar ek nau saal kii bacchee ko nyaay dilaane kii kahani he
 The film has been selected for the competition category of Busan, Black Knight and Mami Film Festival
 vikram kehete hai, ''agar aapke paas behtareen kahani he to us par film banaakar ham aapkaa sapana puraa karenge
 Distributors of our films are PVR
 isliye hamen filmon ke pradarshan kii chintaa nahin he
 If one of our films cost 20 crores
 bhi kama liye to ham safal hai
 We will use social media for promotion
 " aaj ke yuva mobile or laptop se chipke rahete hai or unhen apni soch ke mutabik kam samay vaali filmein chahie
 "the era of generations busy on the Internet and mobile phones is ending in stardom and the time for a good storyteller is beginning

 a post shared by Nirahua (@dineshlalyadav) on Nov 26, 2018 at 12:23 am PST dilli police ne gurmeher kii shikaayat par maamla darj kar liya he haalanki abhi yah pataa nahin chalaa he ki use dhamkee dene vaale koun hai
 As soon as DU student Gurmehar Kaur's statement came, she started getting threats on social media
 kisi ne rape karne kii dhamkee di to kisi ne jaan se maarane kii
 On Monday, Gurmehar complained to the Delhi Women's Commission and on Wednesday, Delhi Police registered a case against unknown people on the same complaint
 dilli police ke pravaktaa deependra pathak ke mutabik 'mahila ayog kii shikaayat ai thi
 We have registered a case and the investigation is on
 ' ipisi kii jin dhaaraon main cese darj kiya gaya he unamem 354 e yani mahila ke sammaan ko thes pahunchaana, 506 yani dhamkee dena or 67 iti act yani soshal citon par kisi ke liye bhaddi tippanee karnaa yaa video daalana shaamil he
 The comments udhar, chaatr sanghathan abivipi ne bhi apni taraf se police ko shikaayat dete hue kaha ki gulmeher ko dhamkee dene waalon par karrwai ho
 According to ABVP leader Saket Bahuguna, 'no one from our organization has threatened them, whoever has given them action
 ' The police will soon record Gurmehar's statement
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki aise maamalon main jaanch ke liye sabase pehle bhadde coment karne vaale yaa video bhejne vaale kii pahchaan kerani hoti he jo aasaan nahin hota kyonki adhiktar log proxi sarwar yaa aise ypi adress se post karte hai jise tres karnaa aasaan nahin hota
 According to Delhi Police spokesperson Deepender Pathak, 'the women's commission complaint was received
 hamane maamla darj kar liya or jaanch chal rahi he
 The sections of the IPC in which the case has been registered include 354A i
e
 defaming the honor of a woman, 506 means threatening and 67 IT Act i
e
 making lewd comments or videos for anyone on social sites
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the student organization ABVP also complained to the police on its behalf, that action should be taken against those who threaten Gulmehar
 abivipi ke netaa saket bahuguna ke mutabik 'hamaare sanghathan se kisi ne bhi unako dhamkee nahin di he, jisane bhi di he us par karrvaai ho
 ' police jald hi gurmeher kaa bayaan darj karegi
 Experts believe that in such cases, the first thing to be investigated is to identify unsightly commenters or video senders which is not easy as most people post from a proxy server or an IP address that is not easy to trace
 udhar, chaatr sanghathan abivipi ne bhi apni taraf se police ko shikaayat dete hue kaha ki gulmeher ko dhamkee dene waalon par karrwai ho

 The address of the sender on the parcel was Arvind Kumar, resident Sundar Pada, Police Line Road, Agra

 However, the police are denying any terror conspiracy and are seriously involved in the case
 offis main puddp kaa video daalkar logon ko fitness chalange dene vaale kendriya mantri rajyavardhan rathod ne panchayat ajtak ke manch par khulaasa kiya he ki ye idia unhen kahaan se aayaa
 Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting and Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports, Independent Charge Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said on the platform of Panchayat Aaj Tak that 30 to 40 years old people in the country are also suffering from diseases like heart attack, depression
 logon ke jivan main tanaav badhata ja rahaa he
 Our PM Narendra Modi also talks about being healthy
 isiilie hamane sochaa ki kyon na kaam ke saath vyaayaam ko bhi jod liya jaae
 Was the video with pushups under planning or did sit-ups take care of the video? On this, Rathore said that i thought why not challenge the young nation
 khel mantralay pararathodane kaha ki sirf olympic kii taiyaari karnaa hi khel mantralay kaa kaam nahin he
 Our priority is to keep the country healthy
 ye sirf swasthya mantralay kaa kaam nahin he
 We are not working to win the Olympics in 2024 or 2028
 ham sabase pehle desh kii sehat kaa foundation acha banane kii koshish kar rahe he
 In response to a question, Rathore said that all the sports ministers who have been there before me must have wondered what the sports ministry has given to them
 isamen zyada kaam nahin he
 It would have been better if we had a powerful ministry
 lekin main aisa bilkul nahin maanata
 Our Prime Minister is very concerned about his health
 ve sidhe hamaare kaam par dhyaan dete hai
 Rajyavardhan Rathore said that the Central Government will try to find out the way for children of 8 to 12 years to go to sports while testing them all over the country
 rathod ne kaha ki is yojana ke tahat ham deshbhar main lagbhag 1 karod bacchon kaa pareekshan karte hue lagbhag 20,000 bacchon ko shortlist karenge or yah tay karenge ki koun se bachche kis khel ke liye zyada achche ho sakate hai
 After this, the provision of scholarship will be made for the children who want to make a future in the game
 rajyavardhan singh ne phek news ke mudde par kaha ki soshal media ek bahut badi takat he or us takat ko bachaakar rakhane kii jarurat he
 If no information will be verified, then the case of fake news will continue to come up
 iske liye sirf soshal media hi nahin balki newsroom ko bhi zyada sajag hone kii jarurat he
 The people of the country also need to verify privately any news before seeing these flaws in the media

 samay nahin thahartaa he sirf thaharne kaa bhram karwaata he
 
 
 And they were both living in those moments
 
 
 apane aap main
 
 
 In his past
 ''sab kuch itnaa aasaan nahin hota mansa
 
 
 Making such a decision at this age
 
 
 bachche bhi kya sochenge? bacchon kaa maanas bhi to isi samaaj ke sanskaron se bana he
 "" You talked to the children? Do the children realize your loneliness? ”manasa asked, looking at his face
 is samay vah unki ek-ek baat ko nakaarne kii mudra main thi, ''aapako sabaki parvaah na karke apane bare main sochna he
 
 
 About his life
 
 
 
 "mansa gave a long sigh
" jabaki usne yah sab kahana band kar diya tha
 
 
 
 apane jivan kaa koi bhi prishth kisi ke saamne na kholane kaa faisla le chuki thi vah
 Nobody had ever come and explained it like this
 
 
 
 Nobody had realized how lonely she would become after the children left
 haa
 
 
 For family members, his roles were definitely tied
 ve chup thim
 She used to look for words to answer
 is samay unka cheharaa abodh bacchee-sa maasoom
 
 
 was appearing
 ye sach he ki, ''itane bade ghar main akelaapan khaane ko daudta he
 Although i keep myself busy but 
 
 jivan main
 
 
 Even in the mind
 
 
 aatma main aisa khalipan bhar gaya he ki lagata he yah ghanaa sannata
 
 
 Do not waste my energy
 
 
 har pal lagata he
 
 
 Rather this
 
 
 satya he mansa ki insaan kii jagah koi nahin le saktaa
 You have lived this pain so you are feeling my pain
 
 
 anyathaa is tarah mere man ko kisi ne nahin samaj
 
 
 "" That's why you just listen to your mind
 '' mansa ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha
 Mansa picked up the diary kept nearby and started turning its pages
 unki ungliyaan kursi ke hathe par thap de rahi thim
 The eyelids were closed
 andar casette player par gazalen baj raheen thi
 She returned to her past after seeing him
 apane jamaane kii khubasurat, vilakshan pratibha se har kshetra main prabhaav jamaane vaali misses sahagal sabake bich lokapriy thim
 
 
 There used to be long queues of students studying here
 
 
 unki buddhi, kaaryakshmata, tark-shakti or vyaavhaarikta ke sabhi kaayal the
 He did not learn to say anything
 mistar sahagal se unhone lav marij kii thi
 There was great harmony between them
 baad ke varshon main mistar sahagal ke saath ek ke baad ek aisi ghatnaayen judati gayi jinke liye unhen lanbaa sangharsh karnaa padaa tha
 From the Human Rights Commission to the departmental inquiry, he wasted a lot of time
 tab bhi unki asaadhaaran sahanshakti ke kaaran chijen
 
 
 Conditions and problems were resolved
 un tamaam pareshaaniyon ke bich bhi ve lagaataar aage badhati gai thim
 For Mr
 Sehgal
 
 
 
 How many hospitals and how many cities were traveling
 
 
 ki ve zindaa rahen
 
 
 Just
 'madam!
 
 
 "she called," What are you thinking? "" How many lives does life change
 kabhi vah kitni lambii lagati he or kabhi lagata he ki samay haath se chuta ja rahaa he
 Mansa, you know
 
 
 jab bhi main pareshaan hoti hum to ek dost kaa khat mujhe santvanaa detaa he
 i am surprised that
 
 
 usne mujh kitne konon se janaa-samajha he
 "" Only then people like us are able to live madam
 
 
 varanaa
 
 
 Mansa said, lightening his battered voice
 usne dekha
 
 
 She was stable now, just as she was
 
 
 ve shaadi
 
 
 She started going to the party and other functions
 
 
 jaise usne janaa shuru kiya tha
 
 
 
 unke chehre par bevakt ai jhurriyon kam hone lagi thim
 As he was reduced
 
 
 par jo usne pal-pal jiya tha vah nahin chaahati thi ki ve use jien
 
 
 
 isliye unke liye jivan saathi kii talash jari thi
 
 
 And
 
 
 yah sanyog hi tha ki
 
 
 He got the opportunity soon
 hua yah ki vah apane bete ke ajukeshan lone ke liye bank main gai thi
 Talking to the manager, it was revealed that his wife was killed in an accident last year
 
 
 ek betaa, behad samajhadaar
 One who understands the pain of the father
 
 
 share karne vaala
 
 
 But daughter
 
 
 ekadam ulat, pita ko lekar behad packesive
 
 
 Unsafe
 rishtedaaron ke bich hoti charchaaon ne uske man-mastishk main jehar ghol diya tha—ki uske pita duusari shaadi kar rahe hai
 "I understood him
" bahut samajhayaa
 You won't believe that i would assure him for hours upon hours
 par vah umr ke aise mode par khadi he jahaan bacchon ke dimag main ghar kar gai baton ko nikaalnaa aasaan nahin hota
 Every time Singh Singh would tell him something about his children
 uski salaah lete
 The grief that arose from his wife's disconnection and the girl's behavior was still filled in his eyes, "how long will he go home with his help
 rishtedaar aate hai
 
 
 Go away
 bina aurat kii duniya kitni viraan ho jaati he
 
 
 Someone can say so much just that
 
 
 
 She would go crazy
 
 
 raat din ronaa
 
 
 Throwing away stuff
 
 
 
 Locked in the room
 
 
 aapane kabhi aisi sthiti kaa saamana kiya?'' singh sahab uske bare main bhi jaananaa chaahate the
 "leave me, sir
 
 
 bachche bahut chote the
 But there is a big tragedy with you
 
 
 '' vah dekh rahi thi do hairaan
 
 
 Troubled lonely beings, who were eating the grief of sorrow standing on two sides
 mansa kaa dimag teji se chalane laga
 
 
 He felt that
 
 
 donon ke bheetar pasre sannaate—udaasi or asuraksha ko
 
 
 can be overcome
 kuch nahin to pahal to kii hi ja sakati he
 But Singh sir
 
 
 or madam
 
 
 His daughter
 
 
 unki bitiyaa to isi bhay se grast he
 Then try to do such trespassing
 
 
 mansa kaa man baichaiyn ho uthta
 If you do, what to do? Leave everyone on their own way
 sab ji lete hai
 
 
 in its own way
 vah jitna swayan ko alag karti, uskaa man udhar hi bhaagta
 Then she would become silent
 lekin mansa kaa man nahin maanata
 Thinking a thousand times, there would have been a way out
 koi prasang uthaati to uske nishkarsh par chintan karti
 "so you thought something?" Mansa went one day and asked
 ''nae sire se sab kuch shuru karnaa
 
 
 "she spoke in the same mood
" ''mere bachche bhi khush nahin hai or unki beti kaa man badalegaa nahin
 Fear of new troubles has started
 kya tumhen nahin lagata ki yah bacchon ke saath anyaay hoga?'' misses sahagal
 
 
 Someone now understands about future events and circumstances
 
 
 jaisi baat nahin sochna chaahati thim
 Here, Singh's daughter had already said, "papa, no other woman should come in your life
" jo bhi aurat is ghar main aegi, mujhe alag kar degi
 “singh sahib had no sleep in his eyes, nor rest of the day
 jyaadati kii to
 
 
 Lest the daughter leave the hand
 
 
 yaa aatmahatya kar baithe
 It was the last year of his son's studies
 vah baahar jane kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 Yes, in the meantime, he had also sent his daughter away from this whole environment to Poona for studies
 ''ab kya dikkat he? xxrep 4 ' sanyog hoga to
 
 
 "mrs
 Sehgal was saying," Mansa, i don't want to hurt anyone's heart
 
 
 ek avsaad se nikalakar duusare avsaad main nahin janaa chaahati
 
 
 How painful it will be
 vipareet paristhitiyon main sabko khadaa karnaa
 Now the mind only wants to see peace and happiness
 
 
 
 "he left them both in the hope of luck
" vakt tamaam chizon ko bigaad-bana detaa he
 This much she knows that in life unimaginable things are never pleasant
 phir
 
 
 Probably seven-eight months later, he saw Singh sahib's baby girl coming to his house
 pehle kii apeksha vah badi, samajhadaar or aatmavishvaas se bhari lag rahi thi
 Mother's separation at this age
 
 
 akele hone kaa vishaad
 
 
 The fear and insecurity of another woman coming into her house and about her own position and status, which was deeply embedded in her teenage mind, was no longer visible
 vah ek-ek vaakya badi mushkil se bol rahi thi
 
 
 "auntie, i had become selfish
" mujhe har pal yahi laga rahata tha ki papa kii duusari shaadi hote hi main or bhaiya is ghar main mehmaan ho jaaenge
 My father will be alien
 par pichley chah maah main maine dekha or feel kiya ki papa ekadam akele ho gaye hai
 Absolutely silent offis main hi zyada rahete hai
 We both have passed out
 ab unke saath ghar main koi nahin rahaa
 We want to maintain our authority even by staying away
 aap baat kariye na
 
 
 
 ''ladki kii badi-badi ankhon main aansu chhalak aae the
 
 
 She had understood the meaning of life and relationships
 ''jab main hostel main rahi tab mujhe ehsaas hua ki jo saath main rahata he, vahi sachcha partner hota he
 Will you introduce me to those aunties? i will request them
 papa kaa rishta ban to jayega
 
 
 The Wouldn't you be angry, aunt? How are they What does it look like? ”the girl was being questioned on the question and Mansa was seeing the blush blossom on her face
 
 
 mansa kii ankhon main aansuon kii badali umadi
 
 
 Something fell in the heart with a splash
 
 
 kaash! usase bhi kisi ne is tarah kuch kaha hota

 ham court ke faisle kaa intjaar nahin kar sakate
 At the same time, we will continue to urge the government to bring a law in Parliament for the construction of the temple

 He said that the people of Amethi and Rae Bareli have sought time to meet the mps there on the issue of Ram temple, they will meet when they give time

 The motif (motto) of this exercise is to demonstrate its' ability to teach a lesson - the weapon at the right time and the right target

 Panipat Box Office Collection Day 12: Arjun Kapoor, Kriti Sanon and Sanjay Dutt's film 'panipat' (panipat) is still doing well at the box office
 yah film abhi bhi cinemagharon main apana kabja jamaane kii puri koshish kar rahi he
 But the film was mired in controversies about Panipat's character Maharaja Surajmal
 haalanki, vivaadon ke baavjood film ne box offis par damdaar kamai karne main koi kasar nahin chodi
 Looking at the initial figures of the film, it can be estimated that 'panipat' would have earned Rs 1 crore on the previous day
 aise main film 12 dinon main kul 31
 Can collect 30 crores rupees
 haalanki, isaki adhikarik soochna milani abhi baaki he
 Filmmaker's reaction on Citizenship Amendment Act, said- My 6 year old son asked wife, are we Hindus
 
 
 arjuna kapur (arjun Kapoor), kriti senon (kriti Sanon) or sanjay dutt (sanjay Dutt) kii 'panipat' (panipat) aitihaasik ghatana par aadhaarit he, jise critics or darshakon se bhi kaaphi acha rispons mila he
 Even Panipat has got a tough fight with Karthik Aryan's 'pati Patni Aur Woh (pati Patni Aur Woh)'
 jahaan maharashtra or iske aas-paas ke kshetron main panipat ko acha rispance mila to vahiin dilli, upi or rajasthan jaise kshetron main film apana kabja jamaane main thodi peeche rahi
 On the other hand, the film made its first day 4
 12 karod, duusare din 5
 78 crores, third day 7
 78 karod, chauthe din 2
 59 crores, fifth day 2
