 While intimate relationships are considered important for the well-being of any married life, every time it is not necessary that the husband and wife are ready for it
 kai baar pati apane kaam ke dabaav se pareshaan hota he to kai baar patni apni nijee ulajhanon main fansi rahati he

 There is too much heat and we are both sweaty
 This is the easiest and most effective excuse women make to avoid intimate relationships
 haalanki ye bahaanaa keval garmi ke mausam main hi kaam karata he lekin baavjood iske adhikansh mahilaayein yahi bahaanaa banaati hai
 2

 In such a situation, the excuse of food poisoning is the best

 Often women do this by accusing their partners of looking at other girls and avoiding them

 petrol-deazal kedamame lagaataar badhotaree ho rahi he
 Many other opposition parties, including the Congress, are blaming the Modi government for this, but the Modi government is citing international conditions as the main reason for the price hike
 daamon main badhotaree ke khilaaf somvaar ko puraa vipaksh sadakon par tha, desh ke kai hisson main virodh pradarshan hua or kai jagah to hinsa bhi hui
 But after the street fighting, the real war started on the media
 soshal media par kya hua?darasal, petrol-dijal ke daam main ho rahi badhotaree ke kaaran vipakshi hamale jhel rahi bhartiya janata party ne somvaar ko twit kar janata ko kuch samajhane kii koshish kii
 But this bet of the BJP backfired
 bhartiya janata party ke aadhikarik twitor acount se somvaar shaam 4
 The difference between the price of petrol and diesel was told in the UPA government and the NDA government by tweeting at 45 pm
 bijepi ne is antar ko graph ke jariye samajhaayaa, lekin jis tarah samajhaayaa us tareeke par bijepi hi funs gai
 The BJP continued to be trolled on social media and the Congress also grabbed it immediately
 congress ne kuch hi minuton main ek nayaa graph banaaya or bijepi ko jawaab diya or uski galatiyon ko ujagar kiya
 Since then, this graph of BJP is getting gritty on social media
 aakhir kya kahana chaah rahi thi bijepi?darasal, jis graph ke kaaran bhartiya janata party trol hui usamen vah us massej ko janata tak nahin pahunchaa pai jo use kahana tha
 The graph showed how during 16 May 2009 to 16 May 2014 the UPA government, then in 5 years, 75 in petrol prices
 8 fisadi kii badhotaree hui thi
 Price 40
 62 rupee se badhkar 71
 41 reached Rs
 lekin bijepi shashan main 16 may 2014 se lekar 10 sitambar 2018 tak daamon main badhotaree 13 fisadi hi rahi
 Petrol price 71
 41 rupee se badhkar 80
 73 reached Rs
 ab agar graph ko gaur se dekhen to bhartiya janata party ne jin chizon ke antar ko darshaya he vah petrol-deazal ke daamon main ho rahi badhotaree kaa he lekin bijepi ne is antar ko fisadi yani pratishat ke hisaab se darshaya he
 According to the bjp's graph, petrol prices rose 75% in five years of UPA and only 13% in four years of NDA
 isi tarah deazal ke saath bhi hua
 In the graph explaining the prices of diesel, BJP showed that the price of diesel was also 83 during the UPA government from 2009 to 2014
 7 fisadi kii badhotaree hui
 Price 30
 86 rupee se badhkar 56
 Reached 71 rupees
 lekin bijepi shashan main 16 may 2014 se lekar 10 sitambar 2018 tak daamon main badhotaree 28 fisadi hi rahi
 Diesel Price 56
 71 rupee se badhkar 72
 83 arrived at Rs
 yani bijepi ke mutabik, upie ke 5 saal ke kaarykaal main dijal ke daam 83 fisadi bade or endie ke shashan main sirf 28 fisadi tak bade
 What is the message from the graph? It is clear that the BJP was trying to show that the pace of increase in the price of petrol and diesel is very low during his tenure
 lekin jis tarah se graph ko dikhaaya gaya, vah trol ho gaya
 It is shown in the graph how the prices of petrol have come down from 71 to 80, but it has been shown in the graph as if the prices are decreasing
 lekin daam bade hai or daam badhane kii raftaar main kami ai he
 Exactly the same happened with the diesel graph
 congress ne kis tarah dikhaaya aainaa?graph ke baad jaise hi bijepi soshal media par trol hona shuru hui, congress ne iskaa phayda uthaaya
 The Congress tweeted a few minutes later adding some items to the bjp's graph
 congress ne apane twit main bataaya ki jab upie kaa kaarykaal chal rahaa tha, tab antarrashtriya str par daam lagaataar bad rahe the
 The Congress explained that despite the high international prices, the prices in India were not so high, but today when the prices are low internationally, the Modi government has increased the prices of petrol and diesel in the country

 Gino Joseph, who has already earned two Mahindra Excellence in Theater Award (META-META) winning plays at the age of 32, is set to debut in Mumbai this week with his latest award-winning drama Nona
 saamaajik-rajnatik vyangy par aadhaarit yah malayalam naatak pichley saal meta se chaar shreniyon main puraskaar jeet chukaa he
 It also includes the award for Best Drama and Director for sarcasm at the growing pseudo-nationality in India
 28 july ko yah neshnal centre for parforming arts main hoga
 Joseph is completely different in the theater world, yet he has no repertory of his own
 ve kerala ke kannur jile main ek chote-se kasbe idur main rahete hai or theatre samoohon se milane ke liye rajya bhar kaa daura karte hai
 Like them, most groups have no academic training in theater
 ve khadi deshon main bhi malayalam associationon ke saath naatak kar chuke hai
 "it's very funny," says Joseph, because they don't have any bias, so it's easy to mold them into any structure
 '' ve do saal pehle purnakalik theatre apnaane se pehle college main praadhyaapak the
 He explains, "I like to take his contribution, his gesture and the tone of speech
 phir is prakriya main apana naatak likhata hum
 He worked for two months with the amateur artists of the Black Theater in Koduvalli in Kozhikode district to prepare Nona (ie lie)
 nona main us vakt tanaav bad jaataa he jab prashanth naam kaa paatr bharat kaa nakshaa banane ke liye gaanv waalon kii madad maangata he or jati ke aadhaar par kuch logon ko lene se manaa kar aapas main vibhaajan kaa beej bo detaa he
 The socio-political outlook has been an integral part of Joseph's work
 ve kehete hai, "meri raay main jin muddon ko darkinar kar diya jaataa he, unhen logon tak pahunchane or virodh darj karne ke liye theatre sabase acha madhyam he
 "but he says that he is not associated with any political party
 unke shabdon main, "main khud keval theatre ke prachaar ke liye hum
 Its job is to attract and entertain people first
 iske baad hi ham muddon ko uthaa sakate hai or unhen prasaarit kar sakate hai
 '' *** bhartiya rigerv bank kii maudrik niti samiti ne buudhvaar ko repo rate main katautee nahin kii he or isamen koi badlaav kiye bina ise 6 fisadi hi rakhaa he
 With this, the common man will have to wait some more time for cheap loans
 jab bhi arabiai kii maudrik niti samiti kii baithak hoti he, to repo rate, reverse repo rate jaise kai terms sunne ko milte hai
 We are telling you the meaning of three such terms of RBI, which are often heard
 iske saath hi aap janenge ki kaise inke ghatane badhane se aap prabhavit hote hai
 Also read: RBI has not reduced interest rates, will have to wait for cheap loan
 Now wait for repo rate, when banks are short of funds, then they take loan from central bank (RBI)
 unhen yah lone ek fiks rate par arabiai kii taraf se diya jaataa he
 This rate is called repo rate
 repo rate hameshaa arabiai hi tay karata he
 Why does the RBI do this when inflation pressure continues in the country, at such a time repo rate proves to be an important weapon to control it
 aise samajhierapo rate ko badhaane se mahangaai par niyantran paane main madad milti he
 In fact, whenever the repo rate increases, banks take less loan from RBI
 isse iconomi main mani supplai main kami aati he
 This helps control inflation
 aap par aise padataa he asarajab bhi repo rate badhata he, to isse bainkon ke liye arabiai se fund lenaa mahangaa ho jaataa he
 This pressure is passed on to the customers
 isaki vajah se aapako milane vaala karj mahangaa ho jaataa he
 Whenever this rate is low, banks get the opportunity to give more loans and they charge less interest from you
 reverse repo ratereverse repo rate vah rate hota he, jis par desh kaa kendriya bank bainkon se lone letaa he
 In simple words, just as you pay interest for taking a loan from the bank, similarly the RBI also gives them an incentive (reverse repo rate) for taking money from banks
 repo rate jitna zyada hoga, bainkon ko utana zyada phayda milegaa
 Also read: rbi's new campaign to prevent fraud, will soon start Why does RBI do this? RBI takes this step to control the money supply in the economy
 aap par kaise padegaa asedgar reverserepo ratezyada hoga, to isse bank aam aadmi ko lone dene main sakhti barat sakate hai athwa ve kam lone dete hai
 In fact, by increasing the reverse repo rate, they get more benefit from the interest on the loan given to the common man, then they reduce the loan
 cash rigerv reshio(crr )cash rigerv reshio vah reshio hota he, jiske aadhaar par bainkon ko kuch paise arabiai ke paas jamaa rakhane padate hai
 You are affected by this, when the cash reserve ratio increases, banks give less loans
 darasal siaraar badhane se unhen arabiai ke paas zyada paise rigerv main rakhane padate hai
 This gives banks less credit and increases lending rates
 vahiin, jab bhi siaraar main katautee kii jaati he, to bainkon par zyada karj dene kaa dabaav banataa he

 Explain that liquor is completely banned in Gujarat

 Millions of people have downloaded and are using it
 hamane sabase pehle is ap ko banane vaale jain-al aabedin kaexclusive intervyuu kiya he
 During the conversation, he has given many interesting information
 agar aap saraahaa yuj karte hai to yah jaankaree aapke liye kaaphi phydemand sabit hongi
 Will the identity of the person sending the message on Saraha be revealed? The same question we asked to the founder of Saraha, jan-al Abedin, was his answer, 'yes, but not without permission'
 yani agar aap kisi kanoon kaa ulanghan nahin karte hai to jaankaree nahin bataai jaaegi
 But the founder of this app has told us clearly that if any government agencies want to, the identity of the sender will be revealed at his request
 haalanki jain-al aabedin ne yah bhi kaha he ki ham kisi bhi yujar kii pahchaan jaahir nahin karenge or iske liye ham patibaddh hai
 But if you use it well
 baatcheet se yah saaf he ki saraahaa ke massej whatsap jaise sicyor nahin hai
 Is chat as secure as whatsapp appreciated? saraahaa or whatsap alag alag tul hai
 End-to-end encryption is available in whatsapp whereas in Saraa it is not
 and tu and ancripshan kaa matlab ye he ki sender or resiver ke alaava koi bhi teesraa iske massej nahin pard saktaa he chaahe wo whatsap ke adhikari hi kyon na hon
 Not only this, government agencies also cannot take information of whatsapp chat
 EXCLUSIVE: clic karen or padhein Sarahah ke founder kaa bharat se kya conection hekya aapkaa data dark web par bechaa jayega?chunki duniya bhar ke log is par acount bana rahe hai or acount banane ke liye email idi deni hoti he
 That is, your information is stored on the server of Saraha
 isliye customers ko dar he ki kya ditels ko bechaa jayega yaa vigyaapan ke liye istemaal kiya jayega
 We wanted to know the answer to this question from Jain al-abedin
 unhone bataaya he,‘aisa bilkul nahin hoga
 We have a strict privacy policy and we can never disclose the identity of a person at any cost
 When will the next feature come? It is necessary for the future of this app to add new features to it
 kyonki log ek samay ke baad bor hone lagenge
 When we asked this question to the founder of this app, he said, 'we have some surprise for the customers, which we will launch soon'
 isse jaahir hota he ki isamen feedback ke alaava bhi kuch fitures aa sakate hai
 However, before the feature launch, you will first get its information on the website till date

 a day after a court granted bail to zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi, the prime conspirator of the Mumbai attacks, Pakistani authorities today imposed stringent provisions of the Public Safety Act against him, under which he will have to remain in jail for three more months
 use jamaanat die jane se bharat main rosh fail gaya tha
 Lakhvi (54) was taken into custody for three months under the 'maintenance of Public Order' (MPO)
 abhiyojan pramukh choudhary ajahar ne kaha, lakhvi ko aaj subah rawalpindi kii adiyaala jail se reeha kiya janaa tha, lekin sarkaar ne use 16 empio ke tahat teen maheene ke liye hiraasat main le liya
 He told that the Government of Pakistan has also informed the Government of India about this
 islamabad kii aatankwaad rodhi adaalat ne lakhvi ko kal sakshya ke abhaav main jamaanat de di thi 
 Lakhvi's counsel handed over the order to the Adiala Jail Superintendent to detain him before the bail authorities were shown the bail order
 abhiyojan pramukh ne bataaya ki sarkaar ne nichali adaalat ke faisle ko hoicourt main chunauti dene kaa saidhantik taur par faisla kiya he
 Azhar said, "we have prepared an appeal against the decision of the Anti Terrorism Court (ATC) and will file it on next Monday
" lakhvi ko reeha karne ke faisle par bharat kii taraf se tikhi aalochana hui he
 The decision that came after Peshawar killed 148 people, including school children, by the Taliban has surprised many
 grahamantralay ke ek sutara ne kaha, navaj sharif sarkaar bhi atisi ke faisle se naaraaz hui, kyonki use aise samay aatankwaad se yuddh par apni niti ke liye bharat se aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa jab vah apni jameen se aatanki network ko ukhaad phenkane kaa sankalp kar rahi he
 He said that to avoid any further embarrassment, the government made a quick decision to take Lakhvi into custody before he was released from jail
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif dwaara aatankwaad se nipatane ke liye ek hafte ke bheetar ek ‘rashtriya yojana’ kii ghoshnaa karne kaa sankalp liye jane ke ek din baad hi lakhvi ko jamaanat mil gai thi
 Sharif had vowed to declare a national plan, saying that terrorism should be eliminated from the 'entire region'
 sutara ne kaha ki maamla pradhanmantri ke sangyaan main laayaa gaya, jinhone tatkaal lakhvi kii hiraasat kaa aadesh diya
 The ATC verdict also surprised the prosecution lawyers, who said that about 15 witnesses were yet to be produced against the seven accused in the Mumbai attacks, including Lakhvi
 varsh 2009 main mukadmaa shuru hone se lekar ab tak abhiyojan 46 gavaah pesh kar chukaa he
 Lakhvi, Abdul Wajid, Mazhar Iqbal, Hamad Amin Sadiq, Shahid Jamil Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Younis Anjum have been charged in connection with the Mumbai attacks

 The BJP then won 91 seats with 48 lakh votes
 ab agar sadsyta vot se bhi dabl ho gai he tab to bijepi ko ramvilas paswan, upendra kushvaha or jithan ram maanjhi kii bhi zarurat nahin padegi
 In 2010, JDU and BJP got 206 seats on the basis of 1 crore 13 lakh votes
 tabake lalu, nitish or congress ke vot ko jod den to yah sankhya bijepi jediu se zyada ho jaati he
 The account of 1 crore 44 lakh votes goes in favor of Nitish
 agar bijepi ke 90 lakh sadasyon main 2010 main paswan ko mili 20 lakh vot jod den tab bhi nitish baari padate hai
 Just tried so hard to tell that sometimes politics seems difficult on paper
 loksabhaa ke vot ke hisaab se bhi nai party kaa palada baari he

 bihar main to nitish kumaar kii sarkaar main lalu yadav or congress baahar se samarthan de hi rahe hai
 Similarly, Lalu and Nitish will not do any work for Mulayam Singh Yadav in UP

 Team India has been under constant criticism ever since the embarrassing 1-3 defeat in the Test series against England
 test siries main ek ore jahaan slip fielderon ne kai ahm maukon par kaich tapakaae, to vahiin top order ke ballebaaj bhi puri tarah se fail ho gaye
 The loss will now have an impact on the wives and girlfriends of the players of Team India
 ek angreji akhbaar indian express kii khabar ke mutabik bisisiai ne faisla kiya he ki khilaadiyon ko apni garlfriend ko is tarah ke daure par le jane kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 Not only this, the BCCI has made preparations to rein in the cricketers' wives on how long they will stay on any tour
 england test siries main viraat kohli kii kharaab form ko lekar to aalochana hui hi, lekin isse zyada charchaa is baat kii rahi ki board ne unhen apni garlfriend anoushka sharma ko saath england le jane kii ijaajat di thi
 a senior BCCI official told that the board will now decide how long the wives of the cricketers will stay with their husbands on foreign tours
 unhone kaha, 'england daura hamaare liye ankhen kholane vaala rahaa
 According to all the information we got, it has been seen that if players want to focus on cricket, then wives distract them
 jab koi khilaadi nets yaa gym janaa chahta he to wo aisa nahin kar pate hai kyonki unki patniyaan ghoomana-phirana chaahati hai
 So we have thought that after the England series we will cut the days of cricketers' wives living together during the overseas tour
 'australia or isibi lambey videshi dauron par khilaadiyon ke liye ek slot bana detii he, jis dauraan ve apni patni yaa garlfriend ke saath samay bitaa saken
 The BCCI is also thinking of doing something similar
 sutara ke mutabik, 'jo hua so hua, ham chaahate hai ki hamaare khilaadi ab cricket par zyada se zyada dhyaan den
 For the England tour, the BCCI allowed Cheteshwar Pujara, Murali Vijay, r Ashwin, Stuart Binny and Gautam Gambhir to take their wives with them
 or viraat kohli ko anoushka sharma ko saath le jane kii ijaajat di gai thi

 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh announced on 20 November 2016 as Congress state president that if his party comes to power in the state, 50 lakh 4G smartphones will be distributed among the youth for free, with free data and calling for one year
 The facility was also promised
 haalanki us samay logon ncemarinder partanj kasate hue kaha tha ki vah desh ke sabase rais shaks mukesh ambani se barabari kar rahe hai
 The fact is that the Captain made this promise in the belief of Geo
 darasal, mukesh ambani ke reliance jeeyo ne desh ke yujaron ko chah maheene ke liye muft internet or colling kii suvidha di he
 Now the question is arising whether Amarinder will be able to fulfill the promise of distributing free smartphones to the youth or not
 hindustan times ne punjab sarkaar evam congress ke sutron ke hawaale se bataaya ki chunaav ke dauraan captain amarinder soobe ke yuvaaon se sirf vaada kar rahe the, jo ambani ne pehle hi kar diya tha
 Reliance Jio had offered to distribute 50 lakh smartphones for free or very cheap when Congress formed the government in Punjab
 isse pehle jayeemarinder punjab kemukhyamantri rahe, tab se ambani ke saath unke kareebi rishte hai
 During Amarinder's CM from 2002 to 2007, Reliance started its ambitious project on government land, which was put in cold beds by the Prakash Singh Badal government
 30 lakh yuva kara chuke hai panjikaranpunjab ke yuvaaon ko smartphone baantne ke liye "captain smart conect" skim ke tahat kareeb 30 lakh yuva panjikaran kara chuke hai
 Under this, the scheme was opened twice for 10-10 days for registration
 jab amarinder se poocha gaya tha ki kya vot ke badale smartphone baantne kaa vaada matadaataaon ko rishwat dene jaisaa nahin he? is par congress netaa ne kaha tha ki smartphone se yuva digital duniya se conect ho sakenge
 However, it remains to be seen how far it is possible for the Punjab government, which is struggling with debt, to distribute free smartphones? Sources in Reliance say that it is not a big deal for the company to give free data for one year
 punjab main reliance ke pehle se hi 40 lakh graahak hai

 13 din baad 21 november 2016 ko rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ke bete vivek dobhaal caman island main GNY asia kholte hai
 It is surprising that from the year 2000 to 2017, India gets eight thousand three hundred crores rupees as FDI from Cayman Island, whereas from April 2017 to March 2018, only eight thousand three hundred crores of rupees in India
 Comes in kya yah chaunkaane vaali baat nahin ki jo epadiai 17 saalon main aata he, vah ek saal main hi aa aata he

 company ne order pahunchaa bhi diya
 But when the customer's eyesight went towards the expari date, then Kipnir's packet was one month old
 packet main paneer ko upyog karne kii aakhri taarikh 28 march he
 That is, about a month old packet of cheese was handed over to the customer
 packet or bill kii tasviir yahaan atech kii gai he
 When the customer complained to the company, the company promised to change the cheese
 in sab ke baavjood jo sabase zyada dhyaan dene vaali baat he wo ye he ki graahak ne samay rahete packet ko upyog se pehle dekh liya
 Unsurprisingly, if the packet was used without observing the viability, there was every possibility of serious disease

 The bjp's Central Election Committee met on Wednesday night to finalize party candidates for the Punjab and Goa assembly elections
 guuruuvaar ko pehali list jari kii gai
 BJP leader j
 pi
 Nadda released the first list of candidates for Goa and Punjab
 punjab ke liye pehali list main 17 or goa ke liye 29 naamon kaa elaan kiya gaya
 Let us tell you that no minister of Punjab has been given a place in the first list of BJP
 bijepi ne apane sabhi vartmaan mantriyon ko philhal hold par rakhaa he
 Although BJP has five mlas in its first list
 aapako bataa den ki punjab main chaar farvari ko ek hi charan main chunaav he
 The BJP will field candidates for 23 seats in Punjab and its senior ally Shiromani Akali Dal will contest the remaining 97 seats
 rajya vidhansabha main kul 117 siten hai
 At present, the BJP has kept 6 seats under consideration
 vartmaan main bijepi ke 11 vidhayak hai jisame se navjot singh siddu kii patni navjot cor amritsar east se vidhayak thim, ve party chhodkar congress main shaamil ho gai hai
 The BJP has once again given ticket to 5 mlas out of 17 candidates, relying on it
 baaki kii 6 seat main se 5 seat par party ke maujuuda vidhayak hai
 Of these 5 mlas, the Punjab government also has two ministers who have been above 75 years
 jalandhar se bhagat laal chuni or punjab sarkaar main mantri or anandpur sahib se vidhayak madan mohan mittal ko party tikat dene ke mood main nahin hai kyunki party ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke baad 75 plus ke netaaon tikat nahin diya jaayegaa 
 So these two leaders are asking for tickets for their family's logo
 ye mantri rah gaye pichhepunjab main bhaajapa ne jin mantriyon kopahali listmen tikat nahin diya ve hai- chunni laal bhagat, madan mohan mittal, surajeet kumaar jayani or anil joshi
 Apart from this, former minister and MLA Manoranjan Kalia from Jalandhar Central and Som Prakash, MLA from Phagwara also could not find a place in the first list
 in paanch vidhayakon ko mila tiktasujanpur- dinesh singh bablu, bhoa (surakshit)- seemaa kumari, pathankot- aswani sharma, jalandhar north- ke
 D
 bhandari, dasuya- sukhjit cor shaahikya he vajah?sutron ke mutabik party varisht netaa jalandhar central se vidhayak manoranjan kaaliya or mantri anil joshi, jo amritsar se vidhayak hai, ko bhi tikat nahin dena chaah rahi he
 According to party sources, negative reports have come to the party about both these leaders
 isiilie party ne in donon ke tikat ko hold kar diya he
 It is believed that BJP does not give tickets to such ministers and wants to convey a clean image among the people so as to avoid the anti-incumbency wave
 bhabhiji aksar ghar par hi rahati hai, ghar ke kaamkaaj main vyast bhi rahati hai, lekin aajkal bhabhiji kii bhoomika badal gai he
 Bhabhi ji has come out of the house on the poster
 ji haa, dilli main emsidi chunaavon kaa aagaaz ho gaya he or khasbaat ye he ki is baar dilli main pachaas fisadi se bhi zyada ward, mahila ummidavaaron ke liye reserve hai
 The women, who are intent on contesting these seats, have started collecting tickets
 lekin is kavayad kaa ek or pahalu ye he ki pachaas fisadi mahila aarakshan main jin maujuuda purush parshadon ke ward bhi mahila ummidavaar ke liye arakshit ho gaye hai, wo apni patni yaa kisi mahilarishtedaar ko chunaav ladaane kii jugat main hai
 This is the only reason that sister-in-law has started adorning the posters after leaving the house

 jab manju yadav ne apane pati ko khoyaa tha tab unke teen bacchon or unke bhavishya ke saamne gaharaa andhera chaa gaya tha
 Her husband was a coolie and after her passing, Manju's family had no other means of income
 tab manju ne ek saahasik kadam uthaaya or ghunghat or ghar kii charadivari se nikalate hue apane bacchon kaa bhavishya sanvaarane kaa nishchay kiya
 Manju set out on her husband's path, challenging the traditional thinking of widow women
 manju rajasthan ke jaipur kii (sundarpura) kii rahane vaali hai
 His decision to become a porter did not embrace the family and society as hardly anyone had heard of a female porter before
 kuli ke peshey main aae hue manju ko ab 5 saal biit chuke hai or vah keval apana or apane parivaar kaa kharchaa hi nahin chalaa rahi hai balki purushpradhan samaaj or garibi se lard rahi mahilaon ke saamne ek misaal bhi pesh kar rahi hai
 Manju will also be one of the 112 women to be honored by President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday
 is sammaan samaaroh main har kshetra se aane pehali mahila ko puraskrit kiya jayega
 The MBA pass will felicitate the President for women who have taken a prolific initiative in the field of women empowerment, including the first woman sarpanch, the first woman legislator to create the first bank for sanitary napkins, and the first woman in the Indian Air Force
 times of india se baatcheet main manju ne bataaya, kuch din 200-300 rupye kii kamai hoti he or kuch din ek-ek graahak kaa intjaar karte-karte shaam ho jaati he
 Some days there is no earning at all
 manju ne bataaya, unki do betiyaan hai or ek betaa
 He is studying in Jaipur and also pays house rent there
 jab manju ne kuli ke taur par apana safar shuru kiya to yah behad chunauteepurn tha
 It was a very difficult task and there was a fear in the mind of the people whether i would be able to lift the goods or not
 tab meraa jawaab hota thaa ki jab mahila pani ke ghadon ko apane sir par ladakar le ja sakati he to phir vah saamaan kyon nahin dho sakati he
 The 112 women to be honored by the President in this honor program organized by the Ministry of Women and Child Development are truly an example of change

 uttar pradesh ke senger bandhuon ke haathon hue aparaadhon kii fehrist unnav rape cese par hi aakar nahin rukati
 Ram Lal Verma, an IPS officer of the rank of Uttar Pradesh cadre, seeking justice for himself, was shot by the Sengar brothers, who were in the chest and stomach, by four brothers
 uttar pradesh main senger bandhuon ne ipies afasar verma par jaanaleva hamale ke ahm dastavej na sirf gum karba die, balki maamle kii sunwaayee saalon tak talavaa di
 In 2004, when Verma, as Superintendent of Police, raided an illegal mining site in Unnao, Kuldeep Sengar's younger brother Atul Sengar and his henchmen shot him
 bhartiya janata party (bijepi) se nishkasit vidhayak or unnav dushkarm maamle ke mukhya aaropee kuldeep senger ne un dinon aisa raajnneetik dabaav banaaya tha ki thane se mahatvapurn cese kii filein chori ho gayi

 Varma said, i was shot four bullets

 unke mutabik chaar baar ke vidhayak kuldeep senger apane rasookh kii badaulat maamle kii jaanch or mukademe kii sunwaayee ko prabhavit karata tha
 He said that i had to file an RTI to ascertain the status of the case
 ek ipies adhikari hone ke baavjood mere saath jo hua, vah behad niraash karne vaala he
 Verma said, the hearing in that case has not started yet
 verma ke bete abhishek verma bhi uttar pradesh cader ke 2016 batch ke ipies adhikari ke rup main chaynit ho gaye
 Despite being from a top police family, Verma is struggling to get justice and to team up with his son to hear his case
 ram laal verma ke mitra or upi main padasth ek diaiji ne kaha, sach to yah he ki senger uttar pradesh main shaktishaalee rajaneta hone ke naate is maamle kii jaanch rukvane main kaamyaab rahaa he
 Police records show that Atul Sengar has several horrible criminal cases against him including the brutal murder of the father of the Unnao rape victim

 On every occasion, from the election speeches, the Congress has been calling the Right to Information (RTI) its major achievement, but there is also a fact that the PMO was also among the top rejectors during the UPA rule in rejecting the RTI that gives strength to the common man

 He has requested the Director General of Police of Jharkhand, taking cognizance of the matter and taking appropriate action to foil such alleged conspiracy

 ’ In the Kairana Lok Sabha by-election, the RLD has staked its claim, which is supported by the Congress
 vahiin is seat ko sapa kisi bhi surat main chhodane ko taiyaar nahin he
 In such a situation, the friendship of both parties is seen to be cracking
 upi main bijepi ke khilaaf ban rahe gathbandhan ke liye kairana ek tarah se gale kii fans banataa ja rahaa he
 If the opposition does not come together in the election summer of Kairana, it will not be easy to beat the BJP

 This announcement by the SP may cause a deep blow to the aspirations of the RLD
 kairana upachunaav main areldi ke choudhary ajit singh ne apane bete jayant choudhary ko apana pratyaashee banane kii yojana kaaphi samay se bana rakhi he
 Not only this, Congress leader Imran Masood of Western Uttar Pradesh has already announced support for RLD in Kairana
 imran ne kaha tha ki agar jayant chunaav ladate hai to phir ve apni daavedaari nahin karenge balki areldi ko samarthan karenge
 SP Kairana is not in a mood to leave the seat under any circumstances
 sapa kaa daawa he yah seat uski he or munwwar hasan yahaan se saansad rah chuke hai

 The Kairana seat is considered to be Gurjar and Jat dominated
 yahaan teen lakh gurjar matadaata hai inamen hindu-muslim donon gurjar shaamil hai
 Apart from this, there are close to 2 lakh Jats
 isi maddenjar areldi ko lagata he gathbandhan ke taur par yah seat jayant choudhary ladate hai to unki jeet aasaan ho jaaegi, lekin sapa kisi surat main ise chhodane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Though Mayawati has already announced not to support anyone in the by-election, but after the cross-voting of the RLD MLA in the Rajya Sabha election, she has also shown her attitude to Ajit Singh
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki ajit singh ne apane vidhayak ko party se nishkasit kar diya tha
 In the Kairana by-election, there is no visible reconciliation between Samajwadi Party and RLD but the final decision has to be taken by Akhilesh Yadav
 aise main ab dekhnaa yah he ki modi ko rokane ke lin banan rahe gathbandhan ko bachaane kii khatir bada tyaag akhilesh karte hai yaa phir atij singh
 Let us know that Hukum Singh of BJP won the Kairana parliamentary seat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections

 There were two Muslim candidates against Hukum Singh of BJP in the 2014 election
 sapa ne nahid hasan ko or basapa ne kanvar hasan ko utaara tha
 In 2013, the Muzaffarnagar riots led to polarization of votes and Hukum Singh benefited from the Muslim vote split due to the presence of two Muslim candidates

 All claims to represent themselves as Muslims are being made by the party

 a five-man team led by Gujarat Minorities Commission Chairman Mehboob Ali has visited Varanasi twice
 ali ne is dauraan sthaneey moulanaon ke saath baithak kar unase modi ke liye samarthan maanga
 Also tried to tell that the misconceptions being spread about Modi are wrong

 BJP strategists said that other parties are showing fear of Modi to the Muslims and to reduce the same fear, Modi sent a delegation of Muslims, including his most trusted people
 is maamle main jab bhaajapa pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak se poocha gaya to unhone keval itnaa hi kaha ki gujarat main jin kshetron main matdaan khatm ho chukaa he vahaan se log modi ke prachaar ke liye varanasi pahunch rahe hai or usamen sabhi varg ke log shaamil hai
 Aam Aadmi Party's Lok Sabha candidate from Varanasi Arvind Kejriwal is also determined to draw Muslim voters into his court
 vah chunaav tak ab varanasi main hi rahenge
 On reaching Kashi, he met Ghulam Yasin, the Muslim religious leader
 kejariwal 23 april ko namakan daakhil karenge

 paanch jagahon par kejariwal logon ko bich baithkar unki samasyaayein sunenge
 On the other hand, Congress candidate Ajay Rai has also started a campaign to meet the Maulanaas
 vah muslim samudaay ke logon ke bich lagaataar prachaar prasar karne main jute hue hai
 If sources are to be believed, Ajay Rai is the hand behind Mukhtar Ansari of the Qaumi Ekta Dal not contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi
 raay or ansaari ke bich andarkhaane kai muddon par sahmati bani he
 However, these leaders are reluctant to accept this publicly
