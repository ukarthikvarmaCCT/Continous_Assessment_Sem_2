 Many times the proverb leads to life and it is a similar story of Rajasthan's famous Kalbeliya dancer Gulabo Sapera
 gulabo sapera ko haal hi main apane lokanrity ko desh hi nahin videshon main bhi pahchaan dilaane ke liye is saal ke padam aword se sammanit kiya ja rahaa he
 Come, let us know about the life of Gulbo Sapera who has illuminated his name in the whole world by beating death
 maut ko di maatarajasthan ke kai hisson main sadiyon se beti ko paidaa hote hi maar deni kii pratha kaa chalan tha
 Due to the orthodox customs of the society, Gulabo Sapera was buried alive by his family members as soon as he was born
 lekin bhagwaan ne to kuch or hi soch rakhaa tha
 Gulabo's aunt dug him out of the ground and gave him new life
 samaaj kii soch kii bhet chadhane ja rahi gulabo ne baad main apane sapera samaaj ke kalbelia dance ko desh-videsh main pahchaan dilaai
 Rahgulabo's childhood came out of difficulties in extreme poverty as his family was living in extreme deprivations
 gulabo ne bade hote hi rajasthan ke lokanrity kalbelia dancer ko karnaa shuru kiya
 When he started this dance, people did not know much about it at that time
 lekin dhire-dhire unke kaam ko pahchaan milane lagi or vah sho karne lagi
 His efforts paid off and he was also helped by the government
 aaj gulabo desh-duniya kaa janaa mana naam hai
 What is Kalbeliya Dancekalbeliya is the name of a community of Rajasthan who are rich
 gulabo ke pita bhi yahi kaam karte the or gulabo unke saath baahar jaati thim
 Gulabo's father played the bean and she danced with snakes to that tune
 kalbelia dance sirf mahilaayein karti hai or isamen vah saanp kii tarah laharaati or balkhati hai
 The father gave 'gulabo' Namgulabo Sapera was the youngest in his house and his father's sweetheart
 unka asli naam dhanvantari tha
 She was very fair and her cheeks were pink in color
 unke pita ko apni beti par bahut pyaar aata tha or unhone unka naam gulabo rakh diya or vah ab isi naam se jaani jaati hai
 The first international performance at the age of 17 was a 1986 Festivals of India event held in Washington and on this tour, Gulabo went out of the country for the first time and performed the Kalbeliya Dance
 is sho ke dauraan rajeev gandhi or sonia gandhi bhi maujuud rahe
 This was the time when a tragic incident also took place in Gulabo Sapera's life
 is sho ke ek din pehle hi gulabo sapera ke pita kaa nidhan ho gaya
 In Bigg Boss-turned-guest season 5, Gulabo Saprane participated in Bigg Boss where he was joined by TV and Bollywood celebrities
 gulabo ne is sho ke dauraan bh apane dance kii prastuti di
 Director JP Dutta gave him the opportunity to dance to hit films like 'ghulami' and 'bantwara' and after that people became interested in Kalbeliya dance
 apane hunar or lagan ke bal par desh-videsh main shoharat kama vaali gulabo sapera ne sabit kar diya he ki yadi koi lakshya paane kaa nishchay kar liya jaae to kuch bhi naammumkin nahin
 After passing in the Lok Sabha, the Muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill, 2018 i
e
 the triple talaq bill is to be tested in Rajya Sabha
 nichle sadane main sarkaar ke paas bahumat hone ke chalate yah vidheyak 245 maton se paas ho gaya, jabaki 11 vot vipaksh main pade the
 At the same time, opposition parties Congress, AIADMK, Samajwadi Party and DMK walked out demanding that the bill be sent to the Select Committee
 lihaaja, rajyasabha main is bill ke bhavishya ko lekar sawaal uth rahe hai ki kahin ek baar yah ucch sadan main na atak jaae
 Government's problems escalated by AIADMK stance Last time when the triple talaq bill came in the Rajya Sabha, it was sent to the Select Committee for detailed discussion
 haalanki, is vidheyak kaa congress ne samarthan kiya tha, lekin uski maang thi ki bill main kuch ahm sanshodhan kiye jaaen
 Keeping in mind the opposition's demand, the government passed the bill from the Lok Sabha with some amendments
 lekin ab bhi kuch aise mudde hai, jinhen lekar vipaksh ada hua he
 Therefore, when this bill came in the Lok Sabha, the Congress declared it walkout as unconstitutional
 lekin sarkaar kii asal pareshaani ediemke ke walkout karne se badi he
 Because it has often been seen in difficult circumstances AIADMK has supported the government
 sarkaar ke paas sankhyabal kii kamirajyasabha main sankhyabal kii baat kii jaae to is samay kul sadasyon kii sankhya 244 he, jisamen 4 sadsy namit hai
 By the way, the strength of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has increased in Rajya Sabha, but that has not happened so that a bill can be passed without the support of the opposition
 taaja halaat dekhen to rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) ke paas 90 sadsy hai, jisamen bijepi ke 73, 7 nirdaleey, shivasena ke 3, akali dal ke teen, bodoland piples front ke 1, sikkim democratic front ke 1, naga piples front ke 1, arpiai ke 1 saansad shaamil hai
 6 JDU mps will be absent from the House during voting
 vipaksh kaa palada bharijbaki vipaksh kaa palada sankhyabal ke maamle main sarkaar par baari he
 In the present situation, the opposition has 145 mps, including 50 of Congress, 13 of TMC, 13 of AIADMK, 13 of Samajwadi Party, 9 of Biju Janata Dal, 7 of Left Front, 6 of TDP, 6 of TRS, 5 of RJD
 There are 2 mps of BSP K4, DMK K4, NCP-4, AAP K3, KC (M) -1, Muslim League-1, JD (S) -1, PDP
 iske alaava namankit or nirdaleey 3 saansad bhi bill ke khilaaf hai
 (KTS Tulsi, Ritbrata Banerjee, MP Virendra Kumar) Apart from the government eyeing these mps, there are some parties which have been changing their positions at different times so they cannot be placed in the category of government and opposition, but their role Is important
 ye dal hai ediemke, pidipi, bijedy, tiares, wiesarsipi, jinke kul saansadon kii sankhya 32 he
 It is to be noted here that the AIADMK, which has 13 mps, walks out of the Lok Sabha and has made its stand clear against the bill
 vahiin, 2 saansadon vaali pidipi bhi bill ke virodh main vot karegi
 While BJD with 9 mps, TRS with 6 mps and YSRCP with 2 mps have not yet clarified their stand
 jaahir he sarkaar kii nigahen in saansadon par hogi
 Will the triple talaq bill be stuck again? The Center intently wants to introduce the triple talaq bill as an important achievement towards women's empowerment before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 vahiin, agar yah bill rajyasabha main ek baar phir atak gaya to sarkaar ke paas is vidheyak ko jinda rakhane ke liye adhyadesh laane ke sivaay doosraa vikalp nahin hoga
 In such a case, the duration of the ordinance will also be 6 months and this Parliament session is also the last session for the Modi government of the Center
 lihaaja yadi is baar yah bill paas nahin hua to nai sarkaar or nai sansad kaa intjaar karnaa pad saktaa he

 Earlier, Sonia Gandhi arrived at Raudareli's airbase from Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Amausi, Lucknow on Thursday morning
 iske baad unhone sidhe raahi block kaa rukh kiya
 Here, some people tried to burn his effigy on Thursday on the statement of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, who arrived on a two-day visit to Amethi
 police ne haalanki pehle hi unhen roak liya
 It should be known that while standing in the box, Rahul Gandhi had said in Jagdishpur village that it does not seem right to adopt any one village and develop it
 vikaas to sabhi gaanvon kaa hona chahie
 He had said that it was not clear where the money would be raised for the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana, the central government made an announcement, but did not make any arrangement for it
 rahul ke is bayaan ke baad gaanv ke purv pradhan ke putr manish tiwari ne kaha ki jab rahul ko pataa tha ki koi fund nahin he, tab unhone kisi gaanv ko god kyon liya
 Instead of telling that thing to the villagers, keep it in Parliament
 congress desh kii sabase puraani raajnneetik party he yaa phir nae jamaane kaa koi corporate daftar? enesayuai adhyaksh kaa chunaav bhi tallent hunt ke jariye kiya ja rahaa he
 Since 2010, Rahul started the process of filling positions in the Youth Congress and NSUI through a talent hunt, since then a large group of senior leaders within the Congress have been criticizing it
 lekin faisla rahul kaa he to bhala koi khulkar bole kaise?dilli emsidi chunaavon main haar ke baad enesayuai kii rashtriya adhyaksh amrutha dhawan ne istipha de diya tha, jiske baad ab party kii website par form daalaa gaya he
 In this, applications for the post of president have been sought till May 8, which will be examined by May 12
 chantni ke baad 15 or 16 may ko walk in intervyuu hoga
 The entire process is overseen by the secretary-general Mukul Wasnik and Secretary Girish
 likhit sawaal bhi hongevaise is raajnneetik niyukti main likhit sawaal bhi honge
 Questions can be of this type - 1
 desh main is vaqt koun se paanch bade mudde hai, unamem se kisi ek ko 300 shabdon main bataaiye
 2
 enesayuai main aapako kya kamiyaan dikhti hai, usase nijaat paane ke aapke paas kya tareeke hai?3
 What road map do you have for NSUI in the next one year? 3
 enesayuai main or kya avasar ho sakate hai?isse pehle bhi rahul tallent hunt ke jariye hi enesayuai or youth main netaaon ko chunate rahe hai, jisaki party ke bade tabake main khaasi aalochana hoti rahi he, lekin rahul kheme kaa maananaa he ki isamen open chayan prakriya ke jariye sabhi ko puraa mauka miltaa he or paardarshee tareeke se chayan hota he, saath hi sirf bade netaaon kii chamachaagiri karke pad paane kaa culture bhi khatm hota he
 By the way, the Rahul camp tells that it is promoting the democratic process
 unke mutabik enesayuai main tallent hunt or youth congress main chunavi prakriya laakar rahul ne party main loktantr ko majboot kiya he
 Also, in the selection of Lok Sabha candidate, Rahul had conducted elections in the party organization as a pilot project
 haalanki wo sabhi 15 chunaav haar gaye the
 At the same time, big leaders also blame Rahul's changes for the poor condition of NSUI and Youth Congress
 bade netaaon kaa maananaa he ki raajnneeti kaa apana culture hota he or corporate jagat kaa apana, lekin raajnneeti main rahul kii enjio mark style aurkorporate culturaparty kii jadon ko hi kamazor kar rahe hai
 Remember that after the big defeat of Delhi Assembly elections, Rahul had said that he will learn from Aam Aadmi Party and Kejriwal
 tabhi ek bade netaa ne tippanee kii thi ki, kya ab party ko enjio banane kii taiyaari he, kyonki kejariwal to enjio mark raajnneeti karke hi aage aae hai
 Actually, Rahul wants to change the party in his own way, but most of his experiments have proved to be a flop in the last 10 years
 saath hi party kii haalat bhi bad se badtar ho gayi he
 In such a situation, on the condition of anonymity, a leader said that it would be better if Rahul changes himself to change the party, then half the difficulties will be solved themselves, but for the moment Rahul is not convinced
 
 
 england kii ek mahila se chandigarh ke ek hotel main rape kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The 50-year-old woman has alleged that the staff raped her during the massage at the spa
 british naagarikta rakhane vaali mahila kii shikaayat ke baad chandigarh police ne shanivaar ko is sambandh main maamla darj kiya he
 The victim came to Chandigarh on 19 December
 vah apane saathi ke saath hotel main rukii thi
 She is alleged to have been raped by the spa staff when she went to the spa for a foot spa service
 police ab maamle kii tahakikat kar rahi he
 According to the report, the age of the accused is 28 years
 ghatana 20 disambar kii he
 Police said that the woman had come to India with her male partner on a tourist visa
 mahila ne police se kaha ki aaropee ne use bina ijaajat galat tareeke se chuaa
 After massaging his partner, the accused raped the woman
 police ne bataaya ki mahila ne hotel othority ko ghatana ke din hi shikaayat kii thi, lekin police ke paas aupchaarik shikaayat shimla trip se lautne ke baad 27 disambar ko kii
 Police officials said- 'the matter is being investigated
 aaropee par rape kii dharaaen darj kii gai hai or vah faraar he
 The hotel chain is located in the Information Technology (IT) Park area of chandigarh
 ' In the two presentations recently presented by Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the focus was on one thing: the crisis facing the Indian Air Force (IAF)
 ieef kii mushkilon ko desh kii sarvocch siyaasi satta ke saamne pahunchaae jane se ek hakeekat saaf hoti he ki chintaa ab ghabrahat main badalati ja rahi he
 The IAF is currently nine squadrons short of its sanctioned strength
 uske paas is vakt sirf 31 vimaan squadran hai (ek squadran main 18 ladaaku jet vimaan hote hai), jabaki uski jarurat kam se kam 40 squadran kii he
 In the next decade, all 230 mig-21 and mig-27 aircraft made in the 1980s will be retired
 sust gharelu utpaadan dar kaa matlab yah he ki unki jagah lene ke liye jin 120 swadeshi halke ladaaku vimaan 'tejas' kaa order sarkaar ne pichley saal hindustan aironautics limited (echeel) ko diya he, vah khep aane main kareeb ek dashak kaa samay lag jayega
 The utility of more than 200 Sukhoi-30 aircraft, the main personnel of the IAF, is also questioned
 isi tarah kii chintaa bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakhkar viksit kiye jane vaale paanchavin peedi ke ladaaku vimaanon (exfee) ko rus ke saath viksit karne ke kaarykram ko lekar bhi he
 Difficulties are being added one after the other
 washington sthit thinkatank carnegi andoument for international pis kii ore se 28 march ko jari ek adhyayan kaa sheershak tha— 'mushkilen, bataliyanon ke swaroop main'
 These difficulties have forced the IAF to publicly express concern about its shrinking fighter aircraft fleet
 air marshall bi
 s
 dhanoa ne 10 march ko dilli main ek press conference main kaha, ''kisi dohare morche vaale paridrishy main vaayu abhiyaan ke kargar sanchaalan ke liye hamaare paas paryaapt sankhya nahin he
 "(in 2009, in the operational instructions of the Ministry of Defense, the armed forces were asked to be ready for war at the same time with China and Pakistan)
 unhone kaha, ''dohare morche vaale paridrishy kii sambhaavna par nigaah to rakhni hi hogi
 But is your number sufficient for that? No
 squadran puraane pad rahe hai
 "the hour of trouble for the IAF comes at a time when Pakistan and China are upgrading their air forces qualitatively and quantitatively
" is tarah ve ieef or pakistani vaayu sena tathaa piples libration army kii vaayu sena ke bich ke antar ko paatane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Pakistan has recently acquired eight F-16 fighter jets from the US and is also upgrading its existing fleet of over 80 F-16 fighter aircraft to the most modern Block 52 standard
 china bhi 2020 tak 800 unnat ladaaku vimaan hasil kar legaa
 Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Institute says, "despite being a world-class combat unit, on the one hand the falling strength and problematic force structure of the IAF on the one hand and the difficult acquisition and development programs on the other hand, India, compared to rapidly modernizing rivals like China and Pakistan, Air superiority of the world is under threat

 "in the desert, the deer Marichika IAF is a unit that has been proud of its strategic reach
" is vakt bhi uske darjanabhar vimaan, jinamein aath ladaaku vimaan hai, yahaan se 8,000 kimi dur alaska main america vaayu sena adde par yuddhayas main lage hai
 But the IAF has made many strategic mistakes
 kuch sabase badi bhuulon main bahu-bhoomika vaale ladaaku vimaan kii khoj main lambii deree shaamil he
 The project started in the year 1999 with the need for 126 Mirage-2000 jets which later turned into a decade-long multi-angular race involving both single and dual engined aircraft
 dashak bhar yah hode chalati rahi or unki laagat 25 arab dollar tak chadh gai jiske baad modi sarkaar ne aakhirkaar is par viraam laga diya
 After this, the Prime Minister announced in his official visit to Paris last April that India would buy about one-fourth of its total requirement i
e
 36 Rafale aircraft directly from France
 ek saal ke baad bhi is qaraar par dastakhat abhi baaki hai, vaise sanket is baat ke hai ki kai maheenon tak chali baatcheet ke baad bharat sarkaar france ko kathith taur par 7 arab euro kaa bhugtan karne ko taiyaar he
 Even if Rafale aircraft are found — all 36 aircraft will be delivered within four years of the signing of the agreement
 Even the IAF will have to go a long way to increase its strength
 ieef ke ladaaku vimaanon kii lagaataar ghatati sankhya puraani yaad taaja karti he
 a decade ago, the IAF started retiring mig-21 fighter jets and was years away from joining the LCA fleet that replaced them, it has faced a number force crisis
 kuch saal baad yah sankat charam par pahunch jayega jab puraane jet vimaanon ke seva se baahar hone kii raftaar unki bharpai ke liye nae vimaanon ke shaamil hone kii raftaar se tej ho jaaegi
 Then the IAF will face an existential dilemma
 is saal farvari main loksabhaa main pesh raksha par sansadeey sthaayee samiti kii report main is baat kaa ullekh kiya gaya he ki ieef kii kshamta kul sweekrut 39
 There will be only 25 squadrons against 5 squadrons
 purv air vaais marshall or nai dilli main centre for air power studies ke manmohan bahadur kehete hai, ''2018 se shuru hone vaale aath saal ke dauraan ieef apane sabhi mig-21 or mig-27 vimaanon ko baahar karnaa shuru kar degaa or hamen unke badale main paryaapt aapurti nahin mil rahi he, jo chintaa kii baat he
 "the triple crisis this time may fade into the iaf's well-planned plan to set up 42 fighter aircraft squadrons by 2026
" is vakt to dashak bhar main kul 250 nae ladaaku vimaan hasil karne kii yojana bhi adhuri rah sakati he
 To overcome all these problems huge amount of resources and long term planning will be required
 iskaa matlab yah hoga ki har saal darjan bhar jet vimaan taiyaar karne ke liye ek saath kai production line ko chalaate rahanaa
 This would also mean the need for heavy capital investment which is not visible at the moment
 ieef ke khate main raksha bajet kaa 23 fisadi aata he
 The IAF spends about 90 per cent of its capital acquisition budget to repay pre-committed liabilities ie agreements on older aircraft
 is tarah ieef ek ore to mahange aayaat or duusari ore niskriy saarvajanik kshetra ekadhikaar main fansi hui he
 The IAF ordered the Aeronautical Development Agency in 2007 for two squadrons of 40 LCA
 ab tak sirf ek vimaan kii aapurti hui he
 Kapil Kak, former Air Vice Marshal and Founder Additional Director of the Center for Air Power Studies, traces the difficulties of the IAF to a decades-old practice in which research production agencies are over-estimating indigenous capacity and supply deadlines
 ve kehete hai, ''ieef ko is mushkil main daalane vaala kshamta se zyada vaada or kshamta se kam aapurti karne vaala lakshan hi he
 "pilot Concerns" The IAF also has a serious shortage of pilots
 loksabhaa kii sthaayee samiti kii report main paaya gaya ki uske paas 1:1
 a pilot is a ratio of less than one per aircraft in exchange for an accepted ratio of 5 (a pilot ratio of 2: 1 in the US and 2 in Pakistan
 5:1 kaa pilot anupaat he)
 This has a direct impact on the operational efficiency of the IAF as more pilots mean more effective use of machines
 isse bhi kharaab baat yah he ki trainer vimaanon kii gambhir kami se pileton ke prashikshan par bhi pratikul asar padaa he
 The IAF has only 274 trainer aircraft as against the government-sanctioned 430 capacity
 teen-stareey pilot prashikshan ke ang ke taur par buniyadi prashikshan se advance jet trainer kii ore badhane vaale pileton ke liye abhi tak aadhi manzil ke taur par vaayu sena kaa jo kiran intermediat jet trainer (ijeti) kaam main aata tha, vah 2019 tak puri tarah seva se baahar ho jayega
 The indigenous IJT that HAL has been developing as a replacement for Kiran for the last 15 years is yet to get an initial operational clearance
 (pilot 55 ghante kaa prashikshan basic trainer par, 87 ghante kaa prashikshan ijeti par or 145 ghante kaa prashikshan advance jet trainer par lete hai, usee ke baad ve ladaaku prashikshu pilot banate hai)
 The IAF is forced to ask the trainee pilots to spend more hours on the basic trainer due to lack of IJT
 rajyasabha saansad or raksha par sansadeey sthaayee samiti ke sadsy rajeev chandrashekhar ijeti kii kami ko ''ieef kii badi khami'' bataate hai
 He says, "IAF is in trouble because we are juggling the worst way possible with the trainer fleet — first, we don't have an initial trainer, then we don't have an AJT and now we don't even have an agenda
" lihaaja ham pileton ko aarambhik trainer se sidhe ageti par bhej de rahe hai
 Then the scenario of mmrchin and Pakistan fighting together on double fronts has given direction to the security strategy of IAF for the last decade
 aadhunik pashchimi ladaaku vimaanon ko shaamil karnaa ab bhi sapana hi he, bhale hi vah pehle se kaaphi vividh sangrah main or ek nae tareeke kaa vimaan jodgaye kii keemat par aata ho
 The agreement to acquire some Rafale aircraft excludes transfer of technology
 iskaa matlab he ki bharat vimaan kii na to marammat kar saktaa he or na hi use unnat bana saktaa he
 Therefore, the government is again looking for another medium-combat aircraft to bridge this gap
 pichley saal ke ant main parrikar ne pahelinuma bayaan diya tha ki bharat mek in india ke tahat desh main banane ke liye ek yaa do ladaaku vimaanon kii talash main he
 Effectively, Parrikar has resumed the medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA) campaign under the banner of Make in India
 is hode main rafel ne jo ladaaku vimaan utaare hai, unamem se teen ke saath yah peshkash bhi he ki ve vimaan sthaneey rup se banaae jaaenge or unamem takanic ke hastantaran kii lubhaavni peshkash bhi he
 In the last few months, Boeing, which manufactures the f / A-18 Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin, which manufactures the F-16, and Saab of Sweden, who made the Gripen, have made several attractive offers
 (do anya daavedaaron / eurofiter or mig-35 par vichaar nahin kiya gaya he)
 Foreign aerospace companies can partner private sector companies to manufacture aircraft in India
 isse echeel par ieef kii nirbharta kam ho jaaegi
 But won't it start another series of waiting for the IAF? apni ek rishte kii bahan kaa kathith taur par farji fasebuk acount banane ke aarope main ek yuvak ko giraftaar kiya gaya he
 In order to avenge the victim after the dispute between the two families, the accused also put some pornographic photos on a fake account
 fasebuk ne kii mahila karmiyon se ajeebogareeb peshkashsibrabad police ne bataaya ki aaropee kii pahchaan ve venu (22) ke taur par hui he or usne apni ek rishte kii bahan ke naam par farji fasebuk acount banaaya or us par ashleel photo daal die jis vajah se peedita ko bahut zyada maansik pidaa se guzarana padaa jiske baad usne 10 november ko shikaayat darj karai
 During the investigation, it was revealed that the accused is none other than the victim's brother
 police ke mutabik, donon pariwaron ke bich rishte tanaavpurn hai
 Because of this, Venu has enmity against the victim's family
 police ne ek vijyapti main kaha ki venu ne shikayatakarta se badla lene or uski chhavi kharaab karne ke liye ek yojana rachi or uske naam par ek farji fasebuk acount bana liya
 He put her picture on the profile photo and put some pornographic photos on the page

 But the big challenge for Rahul and Congress is that they have brought the difference of attitude of BJP and their party to the people

 His Jaswantnagar seat has become a question of prestige for Shivpal Yadav in the UP assembly elections
 yahi vajah he ki shivpal yadav ke saath-saath unke bete aditya yadav bhi gaanv-gaanv jaakar vot maang rahe hai
 In this election campaign in Jaswant Nagar, Aaj Tak correspondent Kumar Abhishek held a special conversation with Aditya Yadav
 is dauraan shivpal yadav dwaara nai party banane yaa phir sarkaar banane ke baad cabinet main shaamil hone ke sawaal par aditya ne kaha ki chunaav ke baad sari chizein aapke saamne hongi
 Special conversation with Aditya Yadav - Question- You and Shivpal Yadav are wandering from village to village
 kya is baar kaa chunaav mushkil he?aditya- chunaav mushkil nahin he
 We are absolutely winning here
 bas main chahta hum ki jeet kaa margin bada ho
 As far as the father is concerned, he should be busy with the turmoil in the party for some time
 kshetra ke logon se jo tach tha, vah khatm ho rahaa tha
 He is roaming the area and meeting people to take him back
 prashn-yadav parivaar main sab kuch thik nahin chal rahaa he
 Is there a danger of internalization? Aditya - There is no risk of a stroke
 kshetra kaa baccha-baccha apane netaa se mil chukaa he
 We also see the movement of all
 sab jaanate hai ki unke netaa ke saath kya dikkat hui
 Now all we have to do is win by a large margin
 prashn-shivpal yadav ne ab kaha he ki 11 march ke baad nai party nahin banaaenge
 Now what is the situation in the family? Aditya - No, the party talk is over
 lekin yah jarur he ki sab milakar baithenge or dekhenge ki aage kaise chalegaa
 There is nothing bad going on in the family
 ham sab ek duusare se baat kar rahe hai
 i talk to Akhilesh Bhaiya about the election
 unase miltaa hum or apane vibhaag ko lekar baat karata hum
 Question- Akhilesh did not come to preach your father? Aditya: - See, before you make it news that Akhilesh Bhaiya never came to preach his father, let me tell you that it is not that we did not call him or he did not come
 
 puure pradesh main or bhi jagah hai, jahaan unki jarurat he
 Everything is fine here
 prashn-aapke pita or akhilesh main kya talkhi kuch kam hui he?aditya- jo bhi baaten thi, vah sab khatm ho gai hai
 Now our main focus is on forming the government
 prashn-aisa to nahin chunaav kii vajah se shanti he or andar-andar maamla sulag rahaa he?aditya- mudda banane ke liye us samay bachaa hi kya tha
 Now these things are baseless and it is necessary that Papa (shivpal) should see his territory, while brother should fulfill his responsibility as Chief Minister and National President
 is samay ham logon ko jo bhi daayitv mila he uskaa nirvaah kar rahe he
 Question- Everyone in the family is contesting elections, why are you far away? abhi sarkaar bananaa he
 Everyone got busy in their respective elections, so the work of the party has to be seen elsewhere
 main abhi coparative kaa chayarmen hum
 i have a lot of responsibility
 prashn-kya chachaa ramgopal se hui talkhi kaa khatra he aap logo ko yahaan?aditya- nahin, dar kii koi baat nahin he
 Everything is fine with me and my father
 abhi ham is sabamein nahin padana chaahate
 Right now the focus is on elections
 ellection ke baad sari chizein aapke saamne hongi
 You will see it all prashn-kya 11 ke baad sarkaar banati he to shivpal ji cabinet main honge?aditya- ye unka faisla he ki vah cabinet main rakhte he yaa nahin
 No decision has been taken yet about the new party
 yah hamaara ghar rahaa he or ghar se alag rahanaa kisi ko pasand nahin hota
 We are trying to end small differences and people see the big picture
 baatcheet se bade-bade hal nikle hai, is manmutav kaa bhi hal nikalegaa

 ) sansad main modi dwaara manmohan singh par tippanee se congress kaaphi aahat najar aa rahi he
 The party took the decision to boycott Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament on Wednesday itself
 ab congress ne modi ke coment par aage kii ranneeti tay karne ke liye vipaksh kii sabhi party ke netaaon kii baithak bulaai he
 According to the latest information, the meeting of the opposition parties is going on in the office of Ghulam Nabi Azad in Parliament
 baithak se pehle modi kii tippanee par congressi netaa ahamed patel ne kaha ki, purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh par modi kaa bayaan thik nahin he uski jitani ninda kii jaae utani kam he
 Ahead of the strategy will be decided
 Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel says, "modi's attack on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday is scandalous
 is par baat karne ke liye sabhi vipakshi partiyon kii meeting bulaai gai he, aage kii ranneeti tay karne ke liye
 "robert Vadra said, Modi's statement shameful
 Meanwhile, Priyanka Gandhi's husband Robert Vadra has also condemned Modi's statement on Manmohan Singh
" unhone kaha purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh par modi kaa bayaan sharmnaak
 On the Prime Minister's statement on the unfortunate Manmohan Singh, Mallikarjun Kharge said, "it is unfortunate that Prime Minister Modi used such language against the former Prime Minister, such a statement should be condemned"
 naidu bole- maafee to congress maangepm modi ke renkot vaale bayaan par bijepi netaa or kendriya netaa venkaiya naidu bole- maafee to congress ko maangani chahie
 Let me tell you that on Wednesday, Congress leader Kapil Sibal condemned Modi's statement and asked for an apology
 congress ko aatm chintan karnaa chahie- anant kumarasansadeey kaary mantri anant kumaar kaa kahana he ki congress ke shasankaal main ghotaale par ghotaalaa hua he
 Whether it is a 2G scam or a coal scam
 ghotaale upie sarkaar main hue hai
 But, there was no stain on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, this is what Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said
 jab bhi congress kaa shashan rahaa he koi naa koi maamla saamne aata rahaa bhrashtachar ko lekar
 Anant Kumar says, "you should think about how the Congress treated its Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 is baat ko lekar aatmachintan karnaa chahie
 The way the Congress has behaved for two and a half years, the public has shown them a mirror
 congress ko hi is baat ke liye maafee maangani chahie

 While there was strong opposition to the use of the name of Rajasthan's city Kota in Rani's film, after which the makers removed the name of this city from the film, the same Salman's film is also facing controversies because the film in his film Some Hindu organizations have objected to the manner in which the sadhus have been shown and they have said that Salman presented religious leaders of any other religion in this style
 Let's can o and target only the Hindu religion
 is parasalamaanane kaha tha ki aisi controvarsi hoti rahati hai
 However, it will be interesting to see how much benefit both films get from these controversies at the box office
 donon filmon ko in kaarnon se ho saktaa he phaaydagauratlab he ki mardaani 2 ko yashraj films ne banaaya he or mana ja rahaa he ki is film ko sadhi hui opening mil sakati he
 However, being a serious film on the dark subject, questions remain about how this film will be able to perform in front of mass audiences
 soshal media par agar film ko lekar mouth publicity hoti he to nishchit hiraani mukherjeeki film main raftaar dekhne ko mil sakati he
 After waiting for Dabangg, fans are eagerly waiting for the third part of this successful franchise after Dabangg 1 and 2

 From the ancient Pandavas Indraprastha to the British settlement of New Delhi and the post-independence population settled in Delhi, the Sultanates in Delhi and the surrounding 9 cities continued to build and fall and the capital of the country would flourish, shrink and mature
 doing
 aaj phir vahi ghadi saamne he jab dilli ko apana nayaa shaasha chunanaa he
 After an aggressive campaign, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal and bjp's Kiran Bedi are resting their weary stools and most pre-poll opinion polls seem to agree that Kejriwal can make a big political upset
 
 chunaav main AAP kii sambhavit jeet se dilli kaa vah badnuma raaj bhi khul jayega ki vah atyadhik vargeey-soch vaala shahar he, jisamen angreji raaj ke daur kaa vishisht lutayans ilaaka or getband rihaaishein hai jo hameshaa jhuggi-jhopadiyon, anadhikrut coloniyon or punarvaas bastiyon main rahane vaale vishaal nichle tabake ko shahar se baahar rakhane kii ummid rakhti hai
 This strong division of Delhi shows that people from the upper class, middle class and newly-educated sections will seek their trust in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's self-proclaimed 56-inch chest and strong shoulders, which now seem more reassuring in their prized suits
 lekin dilli kaa ek bada hissaa, isaki kareeb 1
 60 per cent of the population of 7 crores is Rs 13,500 per month
 (neshnal sample survey kii 2011-12 kii report ke mutabik) se bhi kam par guzaara karata he or is tabake ko modi ke pichley saal ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke bahuprachaarit naare ‘sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas’ main yakeen nahin rahaa
 Or you can say that the slogan did not attract this section, which is struggling with rising prices and rising unemployment, water and power mafia to meet the problems
 pichley saal modi dilli ke abhijatya tabake or saamanti mulyon se saamanjasy baitha chuke netaaon ke liye bahari the or uske shahi tantra main ghuspaith kar rahe the
 He had brought the fresh air of entrepreneur Fitrat from Gujarat and had become a symbol of energy like 'change is possible'
 lekin kejariwal or unki team se loha lene ke liye amit shah kii mantriyon, rajya mantriyon or tamaam netaaon kii fouj utari to aisa jaan padaa, maanon ve shahrukh khan ke dialog ‘main hum naa’ kii nakal kar rahe hai
 This time, Kejriwal is an outsider in the world of Delhi's capitalists
 ve garibon or vanchiton ke prati abhijatya tabake kii dashakon puraani upeksha par nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 This vast lower section resides in Sangam Vihar and 894 other resettlement colonies in South Delhi, called Asia's largest unauthorized colony
 vidambnaa dekhie ki sangam vihaar ke hi bagal main sainik farms bhi apane vishaal bangalon or tarah-tarah ke phool-paudhon ke bich jagamagaataa he
 But Posh Sainik Farms is also completely unauthorized
 donon hi coloniyon main kharidkar yaa apane tub wel se pani miltaa he or ek hi transmishan line se chori kii bijli jalaai jaati he
 This all goes on with the connivance of leaders and babus
 lekin koi bhi sainik farms main dabish daalane kii himakat nahin karata
 It is easy to dismantle slums and drive bulldozers on them, but the need to remove even a brick from the planned structure of this colony can be costly as it is the home of many well-to-do and political influencers
 yahi baat dilli ko kaarobaar kendrit mumbai or puraane jamaane kii chennai se alag karti he, jisaki pahchaan periyar ke saath-saath maylapur brahmanon se bhi banati he
 When people from all over the country have started coming towards Delhi (now there is more migrant population than Mumbai), then people from outside have to clash with this class discrimination, which reduces the caste-system in their villages
 dilli ke ek lakadak ilaake maansingh road par haal hi main ek bangale kii bikri 150 karod ru
 The amount allocated for tribal welfare across the country in Arun Jaitley's 2014 budget (rs 100 crore)
 ) se zyada he
 Sanjay Singh of the Center for Study of Developing Societies says that when you live close to each other in big cities, it becomes difficult to stick to the caste system
 darasal modi shaayad kejariwal kii party par tathakthith 2 karod ru
 The decision to sack Home Secretary Anil Goswami in return for an indecent attack on the hawala transaction would have been more appealing to Delhiites
 goswami par aarope tha ki unhone sharada ghotaale ke silsile main matang singh ke khilaaf sibiai jaanch main dakhsandaji kii
 Even if Kejriwal loses, he has managed to prove to Modi in Delhi that the battle of Delhi is a war of good versus evil and the Prime Minister is not invincible
 yahi nahin, kejariwal ne apni chunavi ranneeti har varg ko lubhaane kii bhi banaai or usee tarah khayraat baantne kaa shagal apanaaya jaise congress karti rahi he
 He gave 700 liters of water per family free of cost to the poor every month (according to the 2013 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, 24 of Delhi
 8 fisadi gharon main pani kii pipeline nahin he
 Then, according to the sample survey, 15 percent of the city's population lives in slums and one in every three Delhiites resettlement colony) and promised to get rid of the water-power mafia
 unhone bhrashtachar or khaskar dilli police kii paisa ugaahi se mukti dilaane kaa vaada bhi kiya, jo shahar kii sadakon or gali-muhallon main autoricshaw waalon, tempo waalon, taxi waalon se paise vasuulati he
 Sociologist Shiv Vishwanathan says, 'AAP politics is the politics of this new disorganized system
 yah vam dalon kii vichaardhaaratmak raajnneeti yaa bijepi kii cader aadhaarit raajnneeti kii tarah paaramparik vichaardhaara kii raajnneeti nahin he, vah shashaktikaran ke bare main he
 Look at your electricity bill
 aap ke haathon main yah keval takneekee sawaal nahin rah jaataa balki naagarikta kaa ho jaataa he
 It becomes opposed, for the convenience that is seen from different perspectives in slums and middle-class colonies
 ’pichley saal bhar se kejariwal ne party kaa sanghathan booth str se taiyaar kiya
 He also apologized for the last time he left the government after 49 days
 ve kehete rahe ki unki aalochana bhale rajnatik aparipakvata ke liye kii jaae lekin unhone koi aparaadh to nahin kiya
 'i'm sorry
 
 
 maine galati kii thi, lekin koi gunaah nahin kiya
 'when Modi was beginning his government work at the Center and Amit Shah was preparing a winning strategy in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir, Kejriwal was busy preparing his land in Delhi
 ve garibon ke hamdard ke rup main khud ko taiyaar kar rahe the
 He exposed the water mafia at the Jal Board, exposing the corrupt practices of power distribution companies
 beshak, garibon ko isse khaas fark nahin padataa ki kejariwal ne pichley saal ganatantr diwas aayojan main dakhal daalane kii koshish kii thi
 He was stunned to see that a chief minister could spend one night on the road in the open
 lekin dilli ke aakankshi madhya varg ko yah nahin suhaya or usne unki sarkaar jate hi unka saath chhod diya or mote taur par bijepi ke saath bana hua he
 Kejriwal's promise to build a modern city with free wi-fi is indeed tempting, but this class did not attract him
 isliye, bijepi main jab kiran bedi banaam harshavardhan banaam satish upaadhyaay kii jang chhidi to kejariwal kii party ko duusari lahar bhi mil gai
 They can continue to haunt the BJP even further and make politics sharp
 baharhaal, kejariwal ne dikhaa diya ki modi ke kavach main bhi chhed kiya ja saktaa he

 a large demonstration of Congress was organized at Jantar Mantar demanding the implementation of the Street Vendor Act in Delhi, during which the Congress joined the Association of Street Vendors of almost all markets of Delhi
 maang uthi ki congress sarkaar ne centre main rahete hue yah act paarit kar diya tha lekin dilli sarkaar ise lagu nahin kar paa rahi he
 This is the reason that the Delhi Congress is now speaking out fiercely against the Kejriwal government for its old works
 nahin maanati he police, emsidi kii bhi he mili bhagatastreet vendors kaa kahana he ki police or emsidi is kanoon ke aane ke baavjood bhi apni harkaton se baj nahin aa rahi or logon ko footpath se uthaa diya jaataa he
 Women vendors say that many times the police even come down to indecency, local policemen pick up the goods and throw them away, and even the men get beaten up
 aakhir kya kahata he yah ectis pradarshan main yah yaad dilaayaa gaya he ki act kahata he ki shahar kii aabaadi kaa dhai pratishat street vendors ko license diya jaae saath hi unako baithne kii jagah di jaae aise main dilli kii 2 karod aabaadi main 5 lakh logon ko iskaa phayda milanaa chahie
 However, no plan has been started in this regard in Delhi, nor has any survey been done on street vendors nor any plan has been made by the Delhi government
 congress ko mila sabhi association kaa saathis pradarshan main congress ko badi sankhya main association kaa saath mila
 It is obvious that the Congress is trying to mobilize public support in Delhi today for the work done by the central government at that time, which is why the faces of the Congress leaders blossomed in large numbers by seeing the crowd
 It is now the challenge of the Congress to do this
 The Congress is also trying to capitalize on this issue as a political advantage

 Bollywood actress Sunny Leone says that she was specially welcomed by Salman Khan when she came to India

 Before joining Bollywood, Sunny got a place in Salman's hit reality show 'bigg Boss'
 sani ne bataaya ki main unki bahut badi prashansak hum
 He was the first person in Bollywood to welcome me in India and wish me well
 isliye unke liye mere dil main khaas jagah he kyonki unhone us samay meri madad kii thi jab aap kuch bhi nahi jaanate the
 Sunny said that i am a big fan of her

 That's why he has a special place in my heart because he helped me at a time when you didn't know anything
 pahaado kii shaan samajhe jane vaale guldaar (tendue kii ek prajati) gaanvon kaa rukh kar rahe hai
 This time their floor is not goats and hill dogs

 This was not the first time
 isse thik do din pehle mashhoor shikari joy hukil ne ravat ke saath milakar is guldaar kii jodidar maadaa ko thikaane lagaaya tha
 On 28 September, after killing another cannibal guldar in neighboring Pauri Garhwal, Hukil reached Pithoragarh for the next hunt
 aakhir jate kyon nahin, in donon jilo main ye narbhakshi guldaar 15-15 se zyada logon ko apana nishaanaa jo bana chuke the
 Guldar terror: If we look at the non-official figures, between 2000 and 2014 in Uttarakhand, about 400 people were killed in attacks by Guldar or any other wild animal, while the number of injured is more than a thousand
 uttarakhand hi kya, desh ke alag-alag ilaakon main tendue or insaan kaa sangharsh bad rahaa he
 Many cities of Maharashtra are struggling with this crisis
 is sangharsh main deshbhar main 2011 main 358, 2012 main 331 or 2013 main 327 tendue bemaut maare gaye
 This second aspect of the data is so that it is difficult to identify the victim side here
 haal yah he ki baaghon ke sangrakshan ke naam par karodon rupee kharch karne vaali sarkaron ne aaj tak tenduon kii aabaadi kii gananaa nahin karai he
 According to the Wildlife Protection Society of India, the population of leopards in the country is between 7,000 and 10,000
 maut ke aage majaboor28 sitambar ke din ko yaad karte hue paudi gadhwal ke maletha gaanv kii 14 varshiya rina kahati hai, '12-14 auraton ke saath main or meri maa maheshwari devi ghaas kaat rahe the
 Suddenly Guldar attacked the mother
 hallaa kiya to guldaar bhaag gaya, lekin maa kii gardan main gad chuke uske daant jaanaleva sabit hue
 'this female guldar had earlier killed Guddi Devi, 36, in the village on 22 September
 tab logon ne dekha tha ki maadaa akeli nahin he, balki uske do shaavak bhi hai
 The government order reads, 'only cannibal guldar be killed
 ' yahi aadesh 28 sitambar ko guldaar ke duusare hamale ke baad kaam aayaa
 The hunter Hukil hurriedly set up a site of hunting for guldar
 unhen bharosa tha ki apana adhuraa shikaar dhundne maadaa guldaar jarur waapas aegi
 He sat for hours and hours
 din dhal gaya
 He became hunter and checker
 use pataa tha ki prakritik shikari din dhale ek chakkar lagane jarur aayega
 At quarter to seven, Guldar came and Hukil shot right
 maadaa guldaar dher ho gai
 The people of the bin training fear that there may be more cannibals, so District Magistrate Chandrashekhar Bhatt assured, 'till the situation is normal, the forest ranger and the forest department team will remain in the village
 ' lekin paudi ke chaar gaanv ke logon ne pichley loksabhaa chunaav main matdaan kaa bahishkaar tak kar diya tha
 These people were protesting the death of Vikas Dhasmana, a student of class nine of Khandoda village, in the attack on Guldar
 van vibhaag kii jang lagi bandooken ab aise van rakshakon ke kandhe par hai, jinhen ab tak bandook chalaane kii training hi nahin mili he
 On this fact, District Forest Officer Rajmani Pandey says, "if not training, what if Guldar comes, he will fire the gun
" ' yahaan yah baat jaan lene main bhi harj nahin he ki gasht ke samay ye bandooken lod nahin rahati
 Three cages are definitely kept in the village to catch another guldar
 lekin koi guldaar in pinjaron ke kareeb nahin fatak rahaa
 Over time, the shy Guldar has also become vicious
 badal rahaa tenduon kaa mizaajahausala badhaane vaale in vaakyon ke baavjood yah sawaal apni jagah bana hua he ki tendue ke hamale aakhir bad kyon rahe hai
 In this regard, Shikari Hukil says, 'half of the 15 guldars i have killed were perfectly healthy and there was no reason to be cannibalistic
 ' phir ve yaad dilaate hai ki uttarakhand ke gaanvon main bade paimaane par palaayan hua he or kheti-baadi bhi kam ho gai he
 In such a situation, leopards have settled around villages rather than living in the forest
 bataaya jaataa he ki 80 fisadi guldaar bhojan ke liye maweshiyon par nirbhar hai
 That is, if man has changed the natural habitat of leopards, then leopards have also adapted themselves according to the new habitat
 vaise bhi billi prajati ke jantuon main tendue ko sabase bada chhalaava mana jaataa he

 ) In a controversial statement today, Home Minister p Chidambaram said that migrant people are responsible for the increasing crimes like rape in Delhi
 unke is bayaan ke baad raajnneetik maahaul garm ho gaya he
 Shortly after this statement, the Home Minister gave an explanation that he did not point towards any state or religion or language or caste or religion
 unako is baat kaa bhaan he ki jo koi bhi dilli aata he vah pravasi he or usamen vah khud bhi shaamil hai
 Chidambaram said that when he was asked about the incidents of rape in Delhi and the alleged failure of the Delhi Police, his reply was actually about migration, illegal housing and unacceptable behavior
 unhone kaha ki vah is baat se niraash hai ki kuch logon ne ‘pravasi’ shabd par zyada jor diya or vivaad ko badhaayaa
 Chidambaram said, 'the country is facing many real issues at the moment and i have no desire to deviate from the real issues
 main pravaasana yaa pravaasiyon ke khilaaf nahin hum
 i am also an expatriate
 main keval us vyavhaar kii taraf ishaara kar rahaa tha jo asweekaarya he
 However, i think the best way to end this whole controversy is to withdraw my answer and i am doing so
 ’ grahamantri ne kaha, ‘main dilli police samet sabhi se anurodh karuunga ki vah vaastavik muddon aparaadh, aparaadh par rokthaam par dhyaan kendrit karen
 The Home Minister said that there are two types of crimes - one by plotting the other when given an opportunity
 police pehle se sochakar kiye jane vaale aparaadhon ko roak sakati he lekin avasarwaadi aparaadhon ko vah keval pahchaan kar sakati he
 He said that catch the culprits and punish them as per law
 unhone kaha ki balaatkaar or hatya se ghrunit koi aparaadh nahin he
 On Monday morning, Chidambaram had said, "on the other hand, crimes are happening because a large number of expatriates live in Delhi
 yahaan par badi sankhya par avaidh coloniyaan hai
 These migrants are living in the northwestern part of the city and behaving in a manner which is unacceptable in any modern city
 isaliye aparaadh ho rahe hai
 Condemning the recent rape incidents in the capital, Chidambaram said that steps have been taken in this direction
 unhone kaha ki naye police steshnon kii sthapana kii gai he, or pulicekarmiyon kii bhartee kii gai he or sadak par police vaahanon kii sankhya badhaai gai he taaki kanoon or vyavastha kii sthiti majboot kii ja sake
 Chidambaram's remarks have drawn severe criticism from leaders of BJP, RJD and SP
 unhone kaha ki yah dilli police kii asafalataa ko chhipaane kaa prayaas he
 Increasing pollution day by day in the capital is now creating problems not only for the people of delhi-ncr but also for the tourists visiting here from all over the country
 badalte mausam ke saath hawa main ai nami ke chalate paryaavaran main maujuud hanikaarak gaisen ab ground level par bani rahengi
 So that our contact with contaminated air will remain straight and for a long time
 jiske chalate sardiyon se pehle hi fog yaa smog ke halaat bane hue hai
 Due to this polluted air, people of delhi-ncr have to face serious health related diseases
 khud se khadi kii gai is gambhir samasya kaa koi hal nikalataa nahin dikh rahaa or khamiyaja sabhi ko bhugatna pad rahaa he
 Visitors from all over the country to Delhi are also facing problems
 nasik se dilli aae ek parivaar se jab hamane jaananaa chaha ki dilli kisi lagi to unka kahana tha, "nasik main to khuli hawa he, yahaan to dhuaan-dhuaan, do din se suraj nahin dikhaa, saans lene main hamaari mata ji ko dikkat aa rahi he, ye thik nahin he, ye rajdhani he
 
 
 The government and the people will have to find some solution together
 "gauratlab he ki pichley kuch dinon se dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main suraj nahin dikh rahaa he
 There are many reasons for this, but it is very harmful for health
 paryaavaranvid aarti mukherjee iske liye sarkaar ko doshi maanati hai
 He says, "the government needs to make a change in policies before expecting people
 keval pataakhon par bain or od-ivan formula dooshit hawa ko sudhaar nahin saktaa
 One has to find alternatives for garbage and crop burning
 construction site ko lekar sakht kanoon banane par jor dena hoga
 People have to provide better alternatives to the growing vehicles on the roads, so that people are not forced to remove the vehicles themselves
 jarurat twarit or eemaandaar pahal kii he
 Otherwise, the coming time will be very heavy on delhi-ncr in terms of environment
 "dilli kii dooshit aabo-hawaek gambhir chintaa kaa samay he
 For those visiting Delhi, it is more of a shock than a problem
 chennai se dilli aae ek or parivaar kaa kahana he, "main shocked hum, itane saalon se dilli ghoomane kaa plan bana rahaa tha par ab to afsos ho rahaa he
 The air of our village in Chennai is so pure
 yahaan to aa kar aisa lag rahaa he gas chambar main hai
 Very disappointed
 mujhe dar he ki mere bachche biimaar na pad jaaen
 "this is the situation of Delhi which is the first choice of the tourists
 duniya bhar se bharat aae sailaani bhi pehle rajdhani kaa hi rukh karte hai
 In such a situation, if no concrete steps are taken soon, then the 'emergency of breath' can be heavy on Delhi

 ' Does every leader survive from sitting on the prestigious chair of the Speaker (speaker) in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly? Is it because of superstition? Many leaders in this Telugu speaking state have great faith in astrology, numerology and vastu
 rajya main aisa hi ek andhvishwaas he ki jo bhi netaa spikar kii kursi par baithta he yaa to wo agle chunaav main haar jaataa he yaa phir uskaa raajnneetik kariyar mushkilon main funs jaataa he
 This superstition is seen not only with Andhra Pradesh but also with Telangana
 telugana vidhansabha ke pehle spikar madhusudan chaari ko pichley saal disambar main hue chunaav main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Chari became a speaker in 2014, but like many leaders in the past, he had to go through surprising experiences
 andhra pradesh (telugana ke alag hone se pehle) ke itihaas par nazar daalen to 1982-83 main do baar ke vidhayak agartala ishwara reddy ko vidhansabha kaa adhyaksh chunaa gaya tha
 But he lost the election against TDP founder NT Rama Rao
 iske baad di shripad raav, pi ramchandra reddy or ji narayan raav jaise varisht netaa bhi 1985 se 1995 ke bich andhra vidhansabha ke adhyaksh bane, in sabhi ko bhi yaa to chunaav main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa yaa inkaa raajnneetik kariyar dikkaton kii vajah se utaar par aa gaya
 This chair was taken over by Andhra's first female speaker, Pratibha Bharati, in 1999
 paanch baar vidhayak or teen baar mantri rah chukin pratibha bharti ko 2004 main hue chunaav main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Former Congress leader k Suresh Reddy, who is considered an influential name in Nizamabad (telangana) politics, also faced such a situation
 2004 se 2009 ke bich reddy andhra pradesh (sanyukt) vidhansabha ke adhyaksh rahe
 But then he had to face defeat in two consecutive elections and his political career came downhill
 suresh reddy ke baad ye pad en kiran reddy ne sambhala tha
 Reddy held the Speaker's chair between 2009-10
 sarvavidit he ki 2014 main andhra se telugana ke alag hone ke baad reddy kis tarah chunaav haar gaye
 Former Congress leader Nadendla Manohar, who joined Janasena, the leader-turned-actor-turned-leader of Pawan Kalyan's party, also faced defeat in the election twice after becoming a speaker
 manohar sanyukt andhra pradesh vidhansabha ke aakhri spikar the or unhone ye kursi en kiran kumaar reddy se sanbhali thi
 Manohar was replaced by Madhusudan Chari in the Telangana Assembly and k Siva Prasad took over the chair in the Andhra Assembly
 ittefaq he ki in donon ko bhi chunaav main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The recent YSR Congress party led by Jagan Mohan Reddy has been a grand success in the recent assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh
 party ko 175 main se 151 seat par jeet mili
 Now, as the history of the Speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly has been history, it will be interesting to see that which MLA is given the distinguished chair of the Speaker

 Indian mobile service provider companies will use GPS in lieu of GPS for their own navic India's indigenous GPS (navigation With Indian Constellation- navic) has been recognized by international organization 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project)
 haalanki yah GPS nahin he
 This is RPS i

 Regional Navigation System
 lekin ab antarrashtriya or desi mobile seva pradaan karne vaali companiyaan navik kaa upyog kar paaengi
 This means that soon you will be able to use Indian GPS in your mobile
 ye bhi ho saktaa he ki aapako jeepies (global Positioning System) ke saath-saath navic kaa ap bhi mobile main mili
 It has been built by the Indian Space Agency (ISRO)
 california main 16 se 20 sitambar ke bich hui ek baithak ke dauraan 3GPP ne navik ko antarrashtriya str ke maanakon par khara pate hue manyata de di he
 Now the Telecommunication Standards Development Society of India will combine these standards with national standards
 iske baad aap ke mobile par america jeepies ke bajaay navic dikhne lagegaa
 ISRO Chief Dr

 Sivan has told an English newspaper that he is very happy that 3GPP has recognized the seafarer
 unhone ne bataaya ki navic puri tarah se kaam kar rahaa he
 For this, 8 of our satellites are deployed over India
 saat satellite nevigation ke liye hai
 One is for satellite messaging
 navic par aadhaarit kuch ap pehle se kaam kar rahe hai, jabaki kuch jald hi shuru ho jaaenge
 Soon we will launch navic based and app
 taaki, aam aadmi ko iskaa laabh mil sake
 navic is not GPS, this RPS people are calling it navic as native GPS, but it cannot be called GPS
 kyonki yah sirf bharat ke upar hi kaam karegaa
 For this, ISRO has placed 8 satellites in the earth's orbit
 inkaa puraa naam he - indian riginal nevigation satellite system (IRNSS) yaa navic
 This will give you better navigation than GPS anywhere in India
 saath hi desh kii simaaon se 1500 kimi baahar tak kaa sateek pojishning pataa chal paaegaa
 What will be the benefit? Since the introduction of navic, since the launch of navic app, we will know the way easily on the three sides: land, air and water
 saath hi aapadaa prabandhan main madad milegi
 Apart from this, there will be ease in vehicle tracking and fleet management
 navic dikhne main thik vaisaa hi hoga, jaisaa america GPS dikhataa he, lekin isaki gunvattta jeepies se behatar hogi

 kaashi main to piem modi ne yahaan tak kah diya ki jo log arthvyavastha ko 5 trillian dollar kii hone par sawaal kar rahe hai, ve nirashaavadi hai
 But both the positive and negative sides are taking cognizance of this
 pie modi ne kaha ki desh ko ek trillian dollar kii iconomi banane main 55 saal lag gaye or sirf pichley paanch saal ke shashan main hi arthvyavastha 2 trillian dollar ko paar kar gai
 This is also true, the size of the economy has increased during the last five years of Modi government
 7 lakh karod dollar tak pahunch gaya
 On the way to China, PM! Significantly, it took nine years (1979 to 1988) for the US to become a $ 5 trillion economy, Japan took eight years (1987 to 1984) and China took just three years (2005 to 2008)
 isse yah sandesh miltaa he ki china agar teen saal main yah mukaam hasil kar saktaa he, to bharat paanch saal main aisa kyon nahin kar saktaa
 The Indian economy is currently one of the fastest growing economies in the world and for some time we have left China behind
 haalanki, pichley kai saal se jidipi main badhat apeksha ke anuroop nahin ho paa rahi
 How the size of an economy is measured The size of a country's economy is measured by its total gross domestic product (GDP)
 yani jitna kul sakal gharelu utpaada, utana hi arthvyavastha kaa aakaar
 GDP is the total sum of total goods and services produced within a country's boundary in a financial year
 ise hi arthvyavastha kaa aakaar maanate hai or isamen badhat kii dar ko hi arthvyavastha kii tarakkee kii dar maani jaati he
 Let's measure GDP this way: GDP = consumption + private investment + government spending + export-import
 yani kisi desh kii khapat, nijee nivesh, sarkari kharch or niryaat ko jodne ke baad usamen se aayaat ko gata den to yah uski jidipi yaa arthvyavastha kaa aakaar hota he
 8% growth in the economic survey It has been said that to create a $ 5 trillion economy, the country will have to achieve 8% faster growth in the next years, while the GDP growth rate in 2018-19 is just 6
 8 fisadi thi
 To achieve such a rapid growth rate, investment will have to increase considerably and in the budget, the government has said to increase foreign investment
 iskaa sandesh yah he ki narendra modi sarkaar agle dinon main videshi nivesh kaa jamkar swaagat karegi
 This means that many reforms will have to be done in the capital market
 videshi or gharelu nivesh ko badhaane ke liye date bazaar main sudhaar hoga, epadiai kii seemaa badhaai jaaegi or exai nivesh ke niyamon main narmi barti jaaegi
 If we look at the economy, consumption is declining, sales of cars and houses are down
 construction sector main itani kamai nahin ho rahi ki growth ko badhaava mili
 But the budget has promised to provide houses to all the poor by 2022, due to which the sector may get a boost
 phir bhi jaankaar kehete hai ki lo vailu niryaat ko badhaava dene, jiesti main sudhaar, bhoomi sudhaar, swasthya kshetra main sudhaar, buniyadi dhaanche ke tej vikaas jaise upayon se is lakshya par teji se aage badha ja saktaa he
 More than 50 percent of the country's population is rural and the income of people in these areas has been stable in the last five years
 piem kisaan yojana ke tahat milane vaale 6,000 salanaa rakam kaa kuch khaas asar nahin hua he
 The unique approach of 'zero Budget Farming' in the budget calls for doubling the income of farmers by 2022, depending on their success, how much growth will be made in the rural economy
 nijee niveshnijee nivesh main giravat dekhi gai he
 Businesses are not showing enthusiasm for investment and banks are reluctant to lend
 gaiyr banking vittiya companiyon (NBFC) main sankat se nakadi kii haalat tang hui he
 Foreign direct investment (FDI) is not growing at a reasonable rate
 MSME sector kii haalat kharablenshnai sector notebandi or jiesti ke asar se ab tak halkaan he
 Due to all this, there is no news of job creation, there have been reports of unemployment reaching a record level of 45 years
 khapat na badhane kii ek vajah berogari bhi he
 Government expenses: Before the election, in the previous Modi government, government spending was curbed
 sarkari nivesh kaa jidipi growth badhaane main bada asar hota he
 It has been said in the budget that 100 lakh crore rupees will be invested in infrastructure in the next five years, but nothing is clear about where the money will come from
 sarkaar ne saarvajanik companiyon ke vinievesh kii baat kahi he
 There has been talk of private investment by the PPP in the railways and other infrastructure sectors, but the giants of this sector are themselves troubled, so they are not showing any enthusiasm in them
 niryaat main sustiniryaat growth main lagaataar susti bani hui he or jidipi ke anupaat ke hisaab se yah 14 saal ke nichle str par pahunch gaya he
 Due to global slowdown and US President Trump's tariff war, there is no scope for a sharp increase in exports for some time
 duusari taraf, kachche tel ke aayaat kii vajah se hamaara aayaat bill saal main kai lakh karod kaa bana hua he, jise piem modi ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 In the next five years, it is not possible that electric vehicles should be adopted suddenly in the country and there will be a huge fall in this bill
 jaankaar kehete hai ki iske liye lo vailu niryaat par jor dena hoga, jaisaa ki viksit deshon ke itihaas se sabak miltaa he

 According to the guidelines of Axis Bank, its customers can withdraw up to Rs 10 lakh a month with 5 free transactions without any payment
 iske upar kiye gaye cash tranjaction par bank charge vasuul karegi
 It is worth noting that banks have argued against imposing this charge on cash transactions that this will prevent customers from withdrawing cash and they will give more preference to cashless mediums

 is vakt tak inamen se kitne pad bhare gaye hai isaki jaankaree nahin he lekin indian express main 25 disambar 2018 ko ek report chhapi thi

 vaise enrolment ke aankaden main acha sudhaar hua he lekin skool jane par bachche ko mil kya rahaa he, sikh kya rahaa he
 Our focus is on it
 das saal se asar kii yah report aati he
 There is also discussion
 kuch asar bhi hua hoga magar ham thode bahut sudhaar par santosh kar lete hai
 In this survey, 16 years old students have been surveyed taking 3 years

 Now come on Uttar Pradesh, this state is chosen because it is discussed day and night

 kya aap apane bachche ko aise skool main padhaanaa chahenge jahaan chauthi, teesri or duusari ke bacchon ko ek hi class rup main bitha diya jaae
 Do you talk on this question, hoping to talk to your leader
 ye teen sawaal khud se bhi puuchhen

 shaam ko chandramaa ko arghya dene se punya prapti hoti he
 Famous singer Akon is bringing his new album 'stadium' at the end of this year
 vah iske saath puri duniya kii saiyr kii yojana bana rahe hai
 According to a website, 43-year-old rapper Akon of Smack That is currently considering a date for the release of his fourth studio album
 isse pehle varsh 2008 main vah freedom lekar aae the
 The album Stadium will be released this year, Akon said
 ham is samay mixing kar rahe hai or saath hi recording kaa bhi kaam chal rahaa he
 Hopefully in a few weeks we will tell about the real dates of its release
 main nishchit taur par iskaa intjaar kar rahaa hum
 Akon has not gone on an official visit since 'OMG Tour with Usher' in 2011
 unhone kaha ki vah manch par waapas utarane ke liye ab or intjaar nahin kar sakate
 He said that he would travel around the world for this album
 album kii relies kii taarikh tay ho jane ke baad is yatra kii taarikh bhi ghoshit kii jaaengi
 In September 2016, the hero of the surgical strike, Lt Gen (retd) DS Hooda, presented his clarification on the removal of AFSPA in the Congress manifesto
 enditivi se baat karte hue unhone kaha ki meri report main AFSPA kaa kaa koi ullekh nahin he or na hi kashmir ghati main jaruri sainikon kii sankhya kaa koi zikr he, kyonki meraa maananaa he ki ye aise faisle hai, joki ek vyapak ranneeti taiyaar hone ke baad hi liye ja sakate hai
 Let me tell you that a few days ago, DS Hooda handed over a 42-page detailed vision document of National Security to Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 aisa kaha ja rahaa he ki le
 Based on the suggestion of General (retired) Hooda, the Congress in its manifesto has talked about changes in AFSPA and changes in sedition streams
 congress ke ghoshnaa patr ke is hisse par guuruuvaar ko piem modi ne dhaava bolaa
 During a rally in Kolkata, he said that the Congress has its manifesto, which is full of lies
 main us kanoon ko hataane kii baat kahi he jisase aantak prabhavit ilaakon main hamaare suraksha balon kii hifaazat hoti he
 He said that the real benefit of removing this law would be of Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki congress ne aatank ke saamne hameshaa ghutane teke hai
 Lt Gen (retd) DS Hooda said that i believe the current AFSPA should be reviewed, as it does not provide full security to the security forces
 isamen kai badi samasyaayein hai jin par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya janaa jaruri he
 He again clarified that but nowhere in my report did i talk about diluting or abolishing this law
 maine sirf samiksha kii baat kahi he
 Lt Gen (retd) DS Hooda also dismissed reports of joining any political party
 bataa den ki congress ke menifeston main AFSPA main badlaav or rashtradroh kii dhaaraon main sanshodhan kii baat ko lekar desh bhar main bahes chhid gai he
 Sometimes i wonder how it would have been if i had a personality like Amitabh Bachchan
 
 
 bhale hi pehali tankhwaah 300 rupee hoti, lekin ek samay baad arabon kii haisiyat hoti
 
 
 Even though 'zanjeer' would have flopped the first 12 films, it would have been a megastar

 Lalu Prasad Yadav's name is also included in the list of such leaders who have reached the top of power and popularity due to their struggles, starting a political journey with socialist values
 11 june 1948 ko janme lalu ne mandal kamishan kii report lagu hone ke baad usee kii chaaya main pichhadi jatiyon ko ekajute kiya
 Lalu, who succeeded in presenting himself as the voice of the backward, became the Chief Minister of Bihar for the first time in 1990 and then never looked back in politics
 san 1995 kaa vidhansabha chunaav jeet kar lagaataar duusari baar mukhyamantri bane lalu ne 5 july 1997 ko rashtriya janata dal naam se apni party bana lee
 Leaving 7 days between 1990 and 2005 (nitish Kumar became the Chief Minister of Bihar for the first time in 2000, but the government fell after 7), Lalu has been jailed in the fodder scam case for continuing to occupy the state's power and His party is struggling for survival today
 vah bhi tab, jab lalu ne 2005 main jin nitish ke haathon satta ganvaai thi, unheen nitish ke bhartiya janata party ke netritv vaale rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan se ruuthane par turant haath mila party ko behatar sthiti main laa diya tha

 The Chief Minister's chair could not be given to Nitish even after getting more seats, Lalu's family to travel from rjd's Arshi to the floor, despite Lalu's family winning more seats in the 2015 assembly elections, Nitish Kumar continues to be the Chief Minister
 Lalu's family could not digest

 Neglect of senior leaders: The neglect of senior leaders is also a big reason behind the plight of RJD
