 shram kanoonon main sarkaar bade paimaane par sudhaar karne ja rahi he
 One of the main objectives of this reform is to provide legal and social security to workers in the unorganized sector, but it is easier said than done
 is sudhaar kii disha main chunautiyaan zyada gambhir hai or sarkaar kii taiyaari behad kamjor he
 For example, no one knows how much of the labor force of the unorganized sector is actually, neither the central government nor any state government
 jidipi main yogadan4 july, 2019 jari kiya gaya aarthik survey 2018-19 kahata he ki kul shramashakti kaa “lagbhag 93 pratishat” asangathit he
 But NITI Aayog released the strategy of 'new India @ 75' in November 2018, saying that "according to some estimates, the unorganized sector of India provides employment to about 85 percent of all workers
 ”in soochnaaon ko strot kya he? aarthik survey 2018-19 ko is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin maaloom he
 NITI Aayog cites a 2014 report 'OECD India Policy Brief: Education and Skill' which is silent about its own information source
 sarkaar kii ek or report he 'report of da cameti on anorgenised sector statisticks', yah rashtriya sankhyikee ayog kii 2012 kii report he jo kahati he ki desh main kul shramashakti kaa '90 pratishat se adhik' asangathit he
 There is no mention of information source here either
 sarkaar maanati he ki asang thit kshetra or kamgaaron kaa arthvyavastha main mahatvapurn yogadan he
 The 2012 report of the National Statistical Commission states that 'this sector contributes 50 percent to national production
 ' lekin yah report yah nahin bataati he ki yah nishkarsh niklaa kaise?iske baad yah report samasya ko vistaar se samajhaati he: “asangathit kshetra ke yogadan, vitaran or iske aakaar ke bare main vishwasaneey aankadon kii kami he
 Therefore, there is neither a real understanding about the importance of this sector in the Indian economy nor is there any consideration in development plans
 ”kaam kii paristhitiyaan or lacksangathit kshetra darasal kanoonee suraksha se vanchit he
 The conditions and social security of the people working in it are very poor
 may, 2019 main periodic lebar force survey (PLFS) 2017-18 jari hua, jahaan is samasya kii jhalak milti he
 This survey says that 71 of those working in the unorganized sector on a regular salary
 1% logon kii naukari kaa koi anubandh nahin he, 54
 2% do not get paid leave and 49
 6% ko kisi bhi tarah kii saamaajik suraksha kaa laabh nahin miltaa
 Overall, the picture of the unorganized sector is quite disappointing
 shram or rojgaar mantralay kii 2015 kii report kahati he ki krishi or gaiyr krishi kshetra main 82% asangathit kamgaaron kii naukari kaa koi anu bandha nahin he, 77
 3% do not get paid leave and 69% do not get any kind of social security benefits
 agar vetan kii baat karen to sthiti isse alag nahin he
 The Minimum Wages Act 1948 is not effectively in force in most parts of the country
 aarthik survey 2018-19 kahata he ki sabhi vetanbhogi kaamkaar kanoon ke daayre main nahin aate or “bharat main har teen main se ek vetanbhogi kaamgaar kanoonee suraksha se vanchit he
 CK Sajinarayan of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) says on the subject that it is shameful
 ve kehete hai, “unhen chhuttiyaan nahin milteen, suraksha sansaadhan nahin milte, medical suvidha nahin milti, parivaar kalyaan ke liye koi madad nahin milti
 Also there is no limit to their working hours
 unke vetan bahut kam hai
 Even after the Unorganized Workers Social Security Act 2008, barely 5-6 per cent could be registered as social security beneficiaries ”
 ol india trade union congress (AITUC) ke mahasachiv amarjit cor kehete hai ki aisa isliye he kyonki asangathit kamgaaron ko koi kanoonee suraksha nahin mili he or sarkaron ne unke hit kii hameshaa andekhi kii he
 However, industry people have a different view on this
 siaiai neshnal cameti aan industrial relation ke chairman emes unnikrishnan kehete hai ki aisa nahin he ki desh ke sabhi hisson main asangathit kamgaaron kaa shoshan hi hota ho, lekin ummid he ki sarkaar nayaa lebar code laa rahi he to isse shoshan rokane madad milegi
 Challenges and the way ahead The challenges of the unorganized sector are immense
 institute for studies in in dustrial deveopment (ISID) ke professor satyaki roy jo ki indian council of soshal sciensej research (ICSSR) ke think tanks bhi hai, kehete hai ki sarkaar ke naye praavdhaanon se or zyada sankhya main kaamgaar suraksha kanoonon ke daayre se baahar ho jaaenge
 They say that if production has increased in the organized sector recently, it is because the number of contract workers has increased in this area
 isliye sarkaar agar rasta khol degi to aise kamgaaron kii sankhya badhegi jinako koi kanoonee suraksha na ho
 According to the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, there are three major challenges
 sabase kathin kaam he ki asangathit kamgaaron kii pahchaan ho, unki saamaajik suraksha ke liye paryaapt fund kii vyavastha ho or paryaapt tantra sthapit ho or gaanvon tak is naye lebar code ko lagu kiya jaae
 However, he is confident of progress in this as the government has expressed the intention of the Ayushman Bharat and Pension Scheme for the unorganized workers
 kam vetan kii chunautiyon se nipatane ke sawaal par unnikrishnan kehete hai ki meri salaah he ki lebar unionon ko is baat par dhyaan dena chahie or kamgaaron ko sangathit karke yah sunishchit karnaa chahie ki unhen paryaapt mehtaanaa mili, saamaajik suraksha or duusare tarah ke laabh milen
 Both BMS and AITUC organizations say that they have already started work in the unorganized sector, despite many difficulties
 ye kaamgaar na sirf bikhare hue hai, balki unka palaayan bhi unke sangathit hone main aade aata he
 The real question is how will the government be able to deal with these problems and challenges? dramuk dwaara samprag sarkaar se samarthan waapas liye jane ke do din baad sibiai ne aaj party pramukh em karunanidhi ke putr emke stallin ke awaas samet 19 sthanon par chhapemari kii
 To this, Karunanidhi has said that his party has often been implicated in false allegations
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki yah kadam raajnneeti se prerit ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 Several Union Ministers have clarified that they strictly reject the CBI raid
 gauratlab he ki diemke netaa karunanidhi ke bete stallin ke ghar sibiai chaape par sarkaar ghirti najar aa rahi he or sarkaar ke mantri safai dete najar aa rahe hai
 The entire opposition, including the DMK leader, has questioned the timing of the raid
 khud sarkaar ke mantri kamalnath or chidambaram ne bhi chaape kii ninda kii he
 Chidambaram said that i have just received information about the CBI raids
 main in chhaapon se jude or tathyon kaa pataa lagane kii koshish kar rahaa hum
 Usually i do not comment on the action of any other department, but i reject the cbi's action in this matter
 kamalnath ne kaha he ki yah chhapemari koi dabaav kaa prashn nahin he
 i condemn it
 main sochataa hum ki yah majaak he, jisaki jitani ninda kii jaae kam he
 On this, Stalin said that the CBI action is political vendetta
 ham maamle kaa kanoonee dhang se saamana karenge
 i do not know the reasons for the CBI raid
 gauratlab he ki yah chapa aise vakt main padaa he jab sarkaar se samarthan liye diemke ke do din hi beete hai
 The CBI has also raided the house of Stalin's secretary Raja Shankar
 tippaniyan DMK leader TR Balu has said that the raid on Stalin is a revenge action
 ham is maamle ko sansad main uthaaenge
 Meanwhile, BJP and SP have also raised questions on the timing of the raid
 kai kendriya mantriyon ne spasht kiya he ki ve sibiai kii chhapemari ko sakhti se khaarij karte hai
 Significantly, the government is seen to be staring at the CBI raid at the house of Stalin, son of DMK leader Karunanidhi and the minister of the government is seen giving clarification
 diemke netaa samet puure vipaksh ne chaape kii timming par sawaal uthaae hai
 The ministers of the government themselves, Kamal Nath and Chidambaram have also condemned the raids

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Assembly elections in Gujarat have intensified
 congress jahaan satta main vaapasi ke liye haath paanv maar rahi he, to bijepi apni satta ko barkaraar rakhane kii jaddojahad main he
 Both parties are eyeing the Patel votes of the state
 rahul gandhi ne saurashtra ke jariye jahaan patel samudaay ko jodne kii kavayad kii to vahiin bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bhi apane paramparaagat voton (patel) ko saadhane ke liye har sambhav koshish main lag gaye hai
 Patidar voters form around 20 per cent of Gujarat's Kingmakers in Gujarat
 maujuuda sarkaar main kareeb 40 vidhayak or 7 mantri patel samudaay se hai
 The Patidar society has been a traditional voter of the BJP
 2014 main narendra modi ke gujarat ke siem se desh kaa piem ban jane ke baad se patidaaron par bijepi kii pakad kamjor hui he
 The Patel agitation started under the leadership of Hardik Patel has weakened bjp's grip further
 hardik patel bijepi ke khilaaf lagaataar maahaul banane ke liye har sambhav koshish main lage hai or pichley dinon to unhone sankalp yatra bhi nikaali thi
 The first choice of Patels in 2012: BJP has two sub-communities in Gujarat
 inamen ek leuva patel or doosraa kadava patel
 Hardik is bitter Patel
 keshubhai patel leuva samudaay se hai
 More than two-thirds of the Patels have been voting in favor of the BJP since the 1990s
 patidaar samudaay main leuva kaa hissaa 60 fisadi or kadava kaa hissaa 40 fisadi he
 The Congress has been getting more support from Leuva than Kadva
 patidaar samudaay sangathit hokar matdaan karata he
 Looking at the last election 2012 figures, 63 percent votes of Leuva Patel and 82 percent votes of Kadva Patel were given by BJP to remove the anger of bjp's Chanakya betrayal on the Patidars, Amit Shah, who is called Chanakya of BJP, has taken command
 amit shah ne gujarat chunaav kaa shankhanaad kar diya he
 To help the Patels, the BJP started 'mission Gujarat' from Sardars Patel's village Karamsad
 ravivaar ko gujarat ke dipti CM nitin patel ke netritv main gaurav yatra nikali, jise amit shah ne hari jhandi dikhaai
 JITU WAGHANI TO LEUWA PATEL: The second phase of the Gujarat Gaurav Yatra begins today from Porbandar under the leadership of BJP state president Jitu Vaghani
 jitu waghani leuva patel hai
 In this way, Shah is trying to help the Patidar community by sending both Patel leaders on a tour of the whole of Gujarat
 gaurav yatra ke jariye 149 vidhansabha par najaranitin patel or jitu waghani ke netritv main nikali donon yatraaen 4700 kimi se adhik kii duuri tay karengi or rajya ke kul 182 vidhansabha kshetron main gramin kshetra kii 149 siton se hokar guzrengi
 It will conclude on 16 October and PM Narendra Modi will address the gathering
 sardaar patel ke sahare bijepibijepi adhyaksh shah ne congress ko gherne ke liye baqayada sardaar patel kaa sahaara liya
 He said that why did Congress give Bharat Ratna to Sardar Patel late? Shah also surrounded the Congress on the Narmada dam issue and said, "why did the Congress stop the dam work? Gujarat government on Patels The Gujarat government led by Mehrbanvijay Rupani has approved the commission for reservation of Patel community
" iske alaava jin patel samudaay ke logon par andolan kii vajah se cese darj hua tha, use bhi sarkaar waapas lene par vichaar kar rahi he
 The BJP government held talks with representatives of the Patidar community and announced several steps to appease the Patidars
 patelon par rahul kii najarcongress bhi patelon ko jodne kii kavayad main lagi he
 Recently, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi made his election debut in Gujarat from the fort of Patels Saurashtra
 rahul ne patelon kaa dil jeetne ke liye sabhi kavayad kii
 From addressing the Patel community to Rahul, he also bowed in the Bodladham temple, which is considered to be self-sacrificing
 congress kaa banataa samikarnapichley do dashak se bijepi satta main he
 This is the reason why there is an atmosphere of anticumbency against the BJP government
 aise main congress ko satta main lautne kii ummid bhi najar aane lagi he
 Congress' vote 55 in 1985
 6 fisadi tha jo girakar 2012 main 38
 It was 9 percent
 isi avadhi main bijepi kaa graph 15 fisadi se badhate hue 48 fisadi tak pahunch gaya
 For the BJP in the last three elections, it has been between 48-50 per cent
 congress ne bhi 1990 main 30
 It improved its performance from 7 per cent to 39 per cent in 2012
 ausatan bijepi or congress ke bich 10 fisadi voton kaa antar rahaa he
 In 2015, the Congress won 8 out of 11 seats in Saurashtra in the Zilla Panchayat elections

 a study published in the journal Psychology and Health found that the holidays are helpful in reducing metabolic symptoms, which also reduces the risk of heart diseases
 america main sthit siracuj vishvavidhyalay ke sahaayak praadhyaapak bris hyruska ne kaha, "hamane paaya ki jin vyaktiyon main pichley 12 maheenon main akasar hi chhuttiyaan lee hai unamem metabolic syndrome or metabolic lakshanon kaa jokhim kam he
 "he continued," Metabolic syndromes are a collection of risk factors for heart diseases
 yadi aapmen yah zyada he to aapako dil kii bimariyon ke hone khatra kahin adhik hai
 This is important because we are actually seeing that the risk of heart disease has been found to be lower in humans who go on holiday more often because metabolic symptoms are variable ie they can change or be erased

 a minor youth has been burnt alive at Chandauli in Uttar Pradesh for allegedly not speaking Jai Shri Ram
 yuvak kii haalat gambhir he or BHU ke trama centre main uskaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 The victim's minor youth claims that he has been punished for not speaking Jai Shri Ram
 haalanki police kaa kahana he ki peedit naaballig yuvak baar-baar bayaan badal rahaa he
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Chandauli SP Santosh Kumar Singh said that the victim was the first to tell that he had gone for a run towards Maharajpur village where he found four boys, these four boys dragged him to the farm and put kerosene on the fire
 Put it peedit naaballig yuvak ne camere par kaha ki vah dudhari pul par tahalne gaya tha jahaan chaar logon ne use kidanap kar liya or jala diya
 The victim says that the accused's mouths were tied, one of them said, sprinkle kerosene on it and hit the matchbox
 ye khud ba khud mar jayega
 After this, he ran away after hitting the match with a sprinkling of kerosene oil
 peedit naaballig yuvak ne kaha, "wo log kah rahe the jai shri ram bolo
 
 
 We did not speak
 
 
 wo log maarane lage
 
 
 "SP Santosh Kumar Singh told Aaj Tak that when he spoke to the victim's minor youth at the district hospital, he told that a youth named Sunil was involved in the incident, the victim told the site Chhetel village
 chhatel gaanv manrajpur gaanv se lagbhag 2 kilometre dur he
 According to the SP, when he was referred to BHU from the district hospital Chandauli, he told the inspector that there were four people and were riding on a motorcycle and picked him up and took him to Hatija village
 police ke mutabik ye gaanv bilkul alag disha main he
 Police claimed that after getting information about these three locations, when they saw the footage of CCTV cameras installed at these three locations, the minor youth did not show up in it
 espi kaa kahana he ki teen baje tak is ghatana main jai shri ram jaisi koi baat nahin thi
 The SP claims that some people tricked the victim and his mother that if the incident was linked to the slogan of Jai Shri Ram, it would become a big affair and he would get financial help
 iske baad in logon ne puraa rukh diawart kar diya
 SP Santosh Kumar Singh says that during investigation it was found that 1 from the spot

 According to the police, this journalist and eyewitness named Dinesh Maurya is still present and his statement can be taken
 is patrkaar ne bataaya ki vahaan koi nahin tha
 According to the Chandauli police, the father of the alleged accused named Sunil had filed a case against the victim's relatives in 2016
 police kaa daawa he ki ho saktaa he peedit ne majaar ke paas tantric kriya kii ho yaa phir andh shraddhavash khud ko aag laga liya ho

 janvari kii pehali taarikh ko jahaan puraa desh nae saal kaa jashn manaa rahaa tha, maharashtra main ek alag hi prishthbhumi taiyaar kii ja rahi thi
 Dalits, who are going to attend the annual event of 'shaurya Divas' in Koregaon Bhima, Pune, were suddenly attacked
 isse saath hi koregaanv bhima surkhiyon main aa gaya or deshbhar main is hamale ke khilaaf virodh-pradarshnon kaa silsilaa shuru ho gaya
 Every year, on January 1, thousands of Dalits commemorate the victory of Dalit soldiers of the British Army over the army of Peshwa Bajirao II in 1818 at the memorial built in Koregaon Bhima as a remembrance of their glorious past (see box)
 maharashtra ke nagpur ke nivasee or dilli ke jawaharlal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke shodh chaatr rahul sonpimple bataate hai, ''darasal, saamaajik buraaiyon ke khilaaf apane purvajon ke sangharsh ke taur par dalit is ghatana ko yaad karte hai ki kaise unhone amanviya peshwa raaj ke khilaaf ladaai ladi thi
 "but what happened this time that the event itself took the form of a struggle? a top police officer says that this confrontation appears to be part of the script already prepared
 darasal, koregaanv bhima ke chaar kimi ke daayre main do pramukh jagahen hai—tulapur or vadhu
 Tulapur is the place where Aurangzeb, the Mughal emperor, killed the Maratha King Sambhaji for nine days of inhuman torture
 dalit maanate hai ki unke samudaay ke ek sadsy ganpat gaekwad ne chhatrapati sambhaji ke shav ke tukade ikattha kiye or puure sammaan ke saath unka antim sanskaar kiya tha
 In 2013, some locals built a mausoleum for Gaikwad in Vadhu in honor of Ganpat Gaekwad to protect the dignity of the Maratha King
 musiibat tab shuru hui jab kuch asaamaajik tatwon ne 30 disambar 2017 ko vadhu sthit gaekwad kii samadhi kii chat ko tod-phod diya
 After that, messages started going viral on social media that seven Maratha youths have been arrested under the stringent Atrocities Act to damage Samadhi
 1 janvari ko jab bhima koregaanv main ladaai kii 200veen saalagirah ke maukey par salanaa aayojan ke liye ab tak kii record taadaad main kareeb 3
 5 lakh Dalits gathered, then some anti-social elements vandalized their vehicles, attacked women and set fire to around 150 vehicles
 iske kuch hi samay baad najadik kii sansawari naam kii jagah par agyaat logon ne ek maratha yuvak rahul phatangade kii peet-petakar hatya kar di
 As a result, tensions between Dalits and Marathas increased
 janvari kii 2 or 3 taarikh ko jab daliton ne puure maharashtra main virodh-pradarshan kiye or sarkari bason main aag laga di or trephic ko teetar-bitar kar diya, tab ve na keval apane samudaay ke sadasyon par hue hamale ke khilaaf aakrosh kaa izhaar kar rahe the, balki rajya main jatigat dhruvikaran kii taraf bhi ishaara kar rahe the
 While the feeling of being sidelined in the minds of Dalits is going home, on the political front too, they have found themselves isolated in the state
 siyaasi jaankaar maanate hai ki yah maamla daliton ke man main lambey vakt se khadbadate aakrosh ko jaahir karne kii shuruyaat bhar he
 About a year and a half ago, Marathas aggressively took out 57 huge rallies across the state to hang three Dalit youths who raped a Maratha teenager at Kopardi in Ahmednagar and provide reservation to the community as well as government jobs
 Was stressed
 us samay bhi daliton main asantosh tha
 On November 29, the special court in Kopardi's case sentenced the culprits to death
 duusari taraf, ek anya adaalat ne ek dalit yuva nitin aage kii hatya ke aaropee aath maratha yuvakon ko bari kar diya tha
 He was further killed for allegedly having a love affair with a Maratha girl
 rajya bhar ke daliton ne adaalat ke faisle ke khilaaf apni naaraazgi jaahir kii thi
 They want the government to challenge the decision of the lower court, which the government has accepted, but has not taken any concrete steps so far

 Dalits are being ignored since the Khairalanji incident
 taaja virodh-pradarshnon ne unamem nai jaan phoonk di he
 However, Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh (BBM) leader Prakash Ambedkar says that the incident should not be viewed from a caste perspective
 ve iske liye kathith hindutvvaadi sanghathanon ko jimmedaar tehraate hai
 He has accused the founder of Manohar alias Sambhaji Bhide and the founder of Hindu Ekta Aghadi, Milind Ekbote, behind the incident
 sonpimple bhi bhima koregaanv kii ghatana ko maratha banaam dalit nahin maanate
 He says, "had this incident been Maratha vs Dalit, there would have been riots across the state by now because Marathas are a big community there
" yahaan kuch maratha sanghathan to is masale par daliton ke saath hai
 Earlier, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Sharad Pawar also said that Hindutva organizations are behind this attack
 sharad pavaar tathaa congress ne iske liye rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or bhaajapa ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Although Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis appealed to the people that some people are trying to create ethnic tensions in the state, in Maharashtra, all the four provinces of RSS RSS issued a joint statement, urging the society to maintain social harmony and Said not to fall prey to the propaganda of the people "who are intent on dividing the society"
 maharashtra ke dalit saamaajik or siyaasi morchon par aitihaasik taur par ekajute nahin rahe hai
 He has a sizeable 12 percent population in the state
 46 vidhansabha kshetron or 10 loksabhaa kshetron main unka dabadabaa he, par ve kabhi kisi ek siyaasi party ke peeche khadey nahin hue
 Mahars also have a greater share of Dalits and are followed by Chamar, Mathang, Dhor and Vadar
 haalanki daliton ke bheetar alag-alag dhadon main koi aapasi takaraav nahin he
 Most of the Mahars have embraced Buddhism and are divided on political fronts
 congress ne hameshaa maatang netaaon ko maharon se zyada badhaava diya or is tarah maharon ko duusare vikalpon kii talash ke liye majaboor kar diya
 The ground reality has been changing since the last decade
 pehle daliton kaa khinchaav shivasena kii taraf tha or unhen uski ladaaka fitrat khub raas aati thi
 In the last two-one years, some sections of Dalits turned to the BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 dalit udhyamiyon se praathamikta ke aadhaar par saamaan kharidne kii centre sarkaar kii yojana ne or 20 fisadi audyogic jaminen daliton ke liye arakshit karne kii rajya sarkaar kii yojana ne samudaay ko bhaajapa kii taraf aakarshith kiya
 The result was that while the Marathas were holding huge rallies demanding reservation, the Dalits stood firmly behind the BJP and helped the BJP along with the civic bodies to emerge as the number one party in the Gram Panchayat elections
 shahari ilaakon tak mahadood bhaajapa ko beete do saal main gramin ilaakon main apane pankh failaane main daliton or anya pichhadaa virgon (obisi) ne hi madad kii he
 Political experts believe that NCP President Sharad Pawar had sensed the mood of Dalits more cleverly
 ve unhen bhaajapa ke najadik jane se rokane ke liye maukey kii talash main the
 The incident at Koregaon Bhima provided him with the necessary facts
 isliye unhone fouran elaan kiya ki koregaanv bhima main daliton par hamale ke peeche hindutvvaadi takatein hai
 In this way they hunted two with the same stone
 unhone hamalon kii jimmedaari aresasapar daalane kii koshish kii or yah pakkaa kar diya ki daliton ke aakrosh kaa rukh maraathon se hatakar bhaajapa kii taraf ho jaae
 The bjp's hopes of an untimely escape from this turbulent political situation rests on the support of the state's Dalit leader and Union Minister of State for Social Justice Ramdas Athawale, whose Indian Republican Party is included in the NDA
 isse rajya main ek dalit cheharaa nahin juta paane kii bhaajapa kii naakaami bhi saamne aati he
 The party brought forward four prominent Dalits — journalists Sunil Gaikwad and Amar Sabale, filmmaker Sharad Bansode and economist Narendra Jadhav — but none of them failed to emerge as the party's Dalit face
 mukhyamantri fadavis maraathon ke khilaaf daliton or obisi ko khadaa karke unki naaraazgi ko kaabo karne main kaamyaab rahe the
 Now that the Dalits are on the rampage, Fadnavis's political maneuver will once again be a litmus test
 is puure afsane ne prakaash ambedkar ko majboot kiya he
 He managed to gain the sympathy of the community
 isse pehle daliton kaa bada tabaka athavle ke peeche ekajute hota rahaa he
 However, Ambedkar also believes that the gap between Dalits and Marathas may widen in the coming days
 vaise ambedkar 'galat' logon ke saath haath milakar apni saakh ganvaane ke aadi hai

 On the other hand, the difficulty for the BJP is that even at the national level, incidents against Dalits have offended Dalits against the government
 haal hi main sampann hue gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bhi una cond ke baad se hi daliton par atyaachaar kaa masalaa uthta rahaa he or mewaani sareekhe bhaajapa-virodh chehre ubhare hai
 Earlier, on the issue of attack on Dalits in Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Rohit Vemula and students of Hyderabad University and also on the issue of Chandrashekhar of Bhima Army, the BJP government at the Center has faced heavy opposition from Dalits
 congress ke saath milakar mewaani ne jis tarah bhaajapa ke khilaaf morchabandi kii he, aisi koshishen anya rajyon main bhi ho sakati hai
 Especially in states like Rajasthan where assembly elections are due this year
 yah is vajah se bhi mahatvapurn hai kyonki 2019 main loksabhaa chunaav honge to daliton ko apane-apane paale main karne kii koshishen tej ho jaaengi
 Donta Prashanth of Ambedkar Students Association says, "this movement of Dalits in Maharashtra will not only have a deep impact, but will also have an impact across the country
" isko lekar deshbhar main hue virodh-pradarshan iskaa sanket de dete hai

 Union Home Minister p Chidambaram has said that the Batla House encounter was not a fake and there is no question of its re-investigation
 unhone kaha ki is bare main party netaa digvijay singh ko jo bhi vichaar hai wo unke nijee vichaar hai
 Significantly, from time to time, Digvijay Singh has been dubbing the Batla House encounter as fake and has been demanding a re-investigation

 'it may be known that Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh said a day ago that Batla House encounter may be fake
 unke is tippanee ke baad chidambaram ne yah bayaan diya
 It is noteworthy that on September 19, 2008, two suspected terrorists were killed in an encounter with police at Batla House in Okhla area of delhi
 donon sandigdh aatankwaadi uttar pradesh ke azamgarh ke rahane vaale the
 In this encounter, Inspector of Delhi Police M
 ke
 Sharma was martyred
 chidambaram ne kaha ki is maamle main singh kii apni vyaktigat raay he jabaki unki raay alag he
 Digvijay Singh on Wednesday also raised the incident once again, calling it 'fake'
 unhone kaha tha ki vah hameshaa se batla house muthbhed ko farji maanate rahe hai or sarkaar or grih mantralay se is maamle kii jaanch karaane kii koshish kii lekin isamen safalataa nahin mil paayi
 Singh said in Azamgarh, 'the Prime Minister and the Home Ministry were of the opinion that the encounter was real
 isliye maine is par baad main dabaav nahin banaaya
 On the other hand, BJP has also targeted Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in this matter
 bijepi ne sarkaar or congress kii aalochana karte hue kaha ki ye donon batla house muthbhed ko lekar do tarah kii baaten kar rahe hai
 He said that on the one hand, Home Minister p Chidambaram is telling him the right encounter, while Congress leader Digvijay Singh is calling it fake
 bhaajapa pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne yahaan kaha, agar grih mantri ke rup main chidambaram batla house muthbhed ko asli muthbhed kah rahe hai to congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi kii upasthiti main digvijay ise azamgarh main farji muthbhed kyon bataa rahe hai

 prasad ne kaha ki maamle ko spasht karne ke liye kya sonia gandhi yaa rahul gandhi apane munh kholenge yaa phir vot bank kii raajnneeti ke liye vah is bare main chuppi saadhe rakhenge
 Accusing the Congress and the government of doing two things about the Batla House incident as a political strategy, Prasad said that this is unacceptable to the country and such a game should be stopped
 unhone kaha ki agar digvijay rashtriya suraksha se khilwaad kar rahe hai to sonia ko unhen party ke mahasachiv pad se turant istipha dene ko kahana chahie yaa bakhrast karnaa chahie
 Known for his honesty, Haryana's fiery officer Ashok Khemka is once again in the news
 is baar unhone haryana ke mantri krishna kumaar bedi ke khilaaf morcha kholaa he
 Khemka and the state's Minister for Social Justice and Women Empowerment Krishna Kumar Bedi are cold-blooded over misuse of a jeep
 khemkaka aarope he ki mantri krishna kumaar bedi ne galat tareeke se apane hi vibhaag kii jeep kaa na keval saal bhar durupyog kiya, balki iske liye koi manjuuri lenaa bhi thik nahin samajha
 Ashok Khemka, a senior IAS officer of Haryana cadre, is a jeep referring to the District Social Welfare Department of Ambala
 bedi is jeep kaa durupyog ek saal se bhi zyada samay tak karte rahe
 The interesting thing is that the officer who was given this jeep for the official work, used to tour and carry out his work
 itnaa hi nahin, mantri ne baar-baar maange jane ke baad bhi jeep ko waapas lautaanaa thik nahin samajha
 Therefore, Ashok Khemka was forced to open a front against him
 krishna kumaar bedi ne yah jeep 29 sitambar 2016 ko maangi thi
 When the minister did not return the jeep at the behest of the district officials, the matter was referred to the concerned department's Principal Secretary Ashok Khemka
 sarkari jeep ke durupyog se naaraaz ashok khemka ne mantri ko na sirf jeep lautaane ke liye kah diya, balki un do kaaron kaa bhi hawala diya, jo unako adhikrut rup se sarkaar kii taraf se di gai hai
 Khemka also wrote that in order to teach honesty to the minister, the powerful must always protect the weak and the power of character lies in obeying the law and not in breaking it
 khemkaane mantri ko yah bhi yaad dilvaaya ki unhone public sarvice main bhartee hone ke vakt ek kasam uthaai thi ki vah samvidhan ke prati vafaadaar rahenge or sabhi uttardayitvon ko nibhaate hue bina kisi dar ke apni sevaayen denge
 On the other hand, since receiving the letter of Ashok Khemka, the minister is hiding his face
 saath hi daawa kiya ki unhone guuruuvaar ko hi vibhageeya vaahan lautaa diya he
 However, after so much cleaning, Khemka did not sit silently and told the minister who misused the department's jeep for a year, to get the approval of the expenses incurred for its use throughout the year before returning the jeep to the department
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki ashok khemka ke is patr kaa haryana kii bijepi sarkaar par kya asar hota he?maaloom ho ki ab tak ashok khemka ne aniyamittaaon se jude jitne bhi maamle uthaae hai, usko lekar tatkaaleen sarkarein unke khilaaf hi karrwai karti rahi hai
 Khemka is the second largest IAS officer of Haryana after Pradeep Kasani, who was transferred the most frequently

 agar kanoon mantri kapil sibbal ke prastaav ko manjuuri mili to jaghanya aparaadhon ke aaropee chunaav nahin lard paaenge
 This proposal goes beyond the Supreme Court's July decision to ban the jailed people from contesting elections and immediately disqualifies the convicted public representatives
 sibbal ne ek vidheyak kaa prastaav rakhaa he, jisamen jaghanya aparaadhon ke aropiyon par roak kaa praavdhaan hoga taaki aparaadhiyon ko raajnneeti se dur rakhaa ja sake
 He said that he has sought opinion on this subject from the Law Commission
 sibbal ne kaha, 'maine vidhi ayog ko likhaa he
 i have sought his opinion, but personally, i have also worked on the draft of the Bill
 'sibbal ne kaha ki unka ‘nijee rup se’ maananaa he ki hatya, apharan, balaatkaar jaise kam se kam saat saal kii sajaa vaale jaghanya aparaadhon ke aropiyon ko chunaav ladane kii anumati nahin honi chahie
 He said, "if they are not guilty, if they are just accused, then they should not be allowed to contest elections
" 'sibbal ne kaha, 'aashaa he ki ham ise aage badhaa paaenge
 When asked if he discussed the issue with the Congress party, Sibal said, 'no, this is my point of view
 main nishchit rup se agle satr se pehle dekhuunga ki main apane sahyogiyon ke saath salaah mashvira karun or ise cabinet main laane kaa prayaas karuunga
 If i could do that, nothing could be so good
 ' unase poocha gaya tha ki kya vah ucchtam nyaayalay ke 10 july ke faisle kii tarj par he, jisamen jail main band logon ko chunaav ladane se roka gaya tha or doshi janpratinidhiyon ko tatkaal ayogy tehraane ke liye kaha gaya tha
 In response to this question, Sibal said, "I am going ten steps ahead of the debate going on
" 'khaas baat yah he ki monsoon satr ke dauraan sansad ne jail main band logon ko chunaav ladane se rokane ke ucchtam nyaayalay ke aadesh ko nishprabhavi kiya tha
 The government had mooted an ordinance to neutralize the Supreme Court's decision to disqualify convicted public representatives, but another bill was withdrawn after Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi criticized the proposal
 gandhi ne cabinet dwaara manjuur hue adhyadesh ko ‘puri tarah se bakawaas’ qaraar dete hue kaha tha ki ise fadkar phenk dena chahie
 The Supreme Court in its landmark judgment had recently rejected a provision of electoral law, which had the provision of protecting the guilty public from disqualification while pending appeals in the upper courts

 abraham and thakor vaale dilli ke david abraham bataate hai ki unhen yaad he, unki syrian chrishchiyan daadi khaas maukon par apni safed chatta munda kii jagah rang-birangi kanjivaram sari pahan liya karti thimru ''khaas taur par ek gahare nile rang kii khubasurat sari mujhe yaad he jo ve pahana karti thim, usamen sari kii hi dizin kaa border tha
 It was the question of identity that encouraged her to experiment with saris — cut, style, get a new look
 abraham and thakor ne sari ke bagaiyr sile or sile-silaae, donon rup dizin kiye hai
 For them, this long untouched cloth can also become a mirror of an Elakahi tehzeeb, even the uniform of an office, even the symbol of a provocative woman
 aise main jab fishan wyk kaa silsilaa ek or spring-samar chakra main pravesh kar rahaa he to puri ummid he ki gaiyr-paaramparik rup se pahani gai kai sadixan ramp par najar aane vaali hai
 Nostalgia's power has been ignored in attempts to give new life to the sari as a garment of new desires
 bhavishya kii sambhaavnaaen samete sari ke aise ateet ne kai dizinron kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchaa he
 She has experimented with sarees, her style and even blouses
 blouse kii baraabar kii ahmiyat he or vah apane aap main ek style statement he jo sari ke liye bhi game-changer ke rup main kaam kar saktaa he—ek bambar jacket ke rup main yaa kep yaa phir crocked shart ke taur par
 There are also international examples of saris
 japani sangeetkaar yoshiki ko duniya bhar main haivi metal sangeet group eks japan kaa pramukh or sah-sansthaapak mana jaataa he
 Yoshiki established its kimono brand Yoshikomono in 2015
 uske pehle collection main 'rock star kimono' kii range thi, jisamen gaiyr-paaramparik print the or kahin sharir se chipke kimono main asaamaanya obi belt thi to kahin uski lambaai mini-skirt ke aakaar kii kar di gai thi jo oonchi edi ke saath pahani jaani thi to kahin usamen oonchi hill vaale boot ke saath pahanane ke liye chamade kii collar laga di gai thi
 The Indian sari, which has never followed the established style, seems to be following similar changes
 rita kapur chishti kii 2010 main ai kitaab sareej of india—tradishan and biyond main ise draupadi ke 'samay kaa antaheen vastra' kaha gaya tha
 This robe has made a comeback like on the ramp
 vah bade hi sahaj tareeke se nai diginon or fishan se muqabla kar rahi he, diziner ateet kii yaadon kaa bhavishya kii diginon ke saath talmail baitha rahe hai
 Kimono found new life in Japan through giants such as Yohaji Yamamato and Ri Kawakubo who redeveloped the kimono, defying Western fashion's prequel predictions
 usee tarah se bharat main bhi fishan kii duniya main ek dilachasp uthal-puthal ho rahi he
 These days, designers are adapting saris as an almost ambitious, almost revolutionary choice of clothes
 san 2006 ke baad sari ko lagbhag ek nayaa jivan mila he
 Although it was still the most worn garment in India, it had lost its appeal among the 'smart' section
 bharat ke sabase kaamyaab dizinron main se ek kolkata ke sabyasachi mukherjee ne 2009 main 'seve da sari' project shuru kiya
 Then in 2011, French fashion designer Hermes entered the Indian market with 28 handicrafts
 inamen se harek sari lagbhag 4
 5 lakhs
 keemat kii thi
 This gave Sari a place again as a canvas of art
 aaj yani 2017 main hameshaa se kahin zyada diziner sari ke saath prayog karne main lage hai
 Social media is also hot with the discussion of saris — 100 saripact trends on Twitter, while Facebook also has several groups dedicated to saris, such as Kaithari, For the Love of Sari, Sadi Sari and The Magic of the Sarees
 sari ab ek digital kranti kaa bhi hissaa he to bharat main yahi ek aisa vastra bhi he jo peedi dar peedi aage badhaane kii parampara kaa ang ab bhi he
 The fashion week of the last few years has also proved this
 kai diziner aise collection pesh kar rahe hai jinamein sari shaamil he to kai keval sari ke hi collection pesh kar rahe hai
 Such as Anavila Sindhu Mishra giving her contemporary look with a different style and wrap art
 aaj ke diziner shaashvat samajhi jane vaali sari ko un tareekon se samajhane or pesh karne ke raste khoj rahe hai jinase vah goun sareekhe kapadon se muqabla kar sake
 Amongst these designers, there are veterans like Abraham and Thakore, and also new designers like Vasant Ki Gunjan Jain, who are passionate about traditional weaving and workmanship
 gunjan kaa vriksh odisha kii bomakai or ikat jaisi bunai main khaas maharath rakhata he
 Abraham says, "the return of the sari is actually part of a larger debate about identity
" '' or yah pahchaan purushon kii nigahon ke bich adig khadi draupadi kii he, ek aisi duniya main jahaan saanskrithik charitra kii khaasi uthal-puthal or anya saamaajik-aarthik badlaavon ke chalate purushochit or striyochit main dhruvikaran nirantar gaharaa ho rahaa he
 Says Chishti, "indian women have a deep bond with the sari and a sense of identity, which makes them uncharacteristically hesitant to change their dress style
 isi vajah se desh ke har bhaag main bunai kii paramparaayen kaayam hai
 In search of these possibilities of the future, she set out on a tour of the country a few years ago and started recording information about sarees
 sari ko lekar kai myth or kahaniyaan chalan main thim jisase vah ek jinda vastra sareekhee thi, jaise ki yah kahani ki bomakai main karela or machhlee sari ke saath buni jaati he
 In this way, through the design directory of the weavers, the memories come alive on clothes
 aaj isi vikaas kram main sari zyada aakraamak ho gai or google cultural institute or ek online fasnal portal border and fall ne assi tarah kii sadiiyon kaa zikr kiya he
 Chishti runs a sari school where visitors are told about the history of the sari and about 108 ways to tie it
 ve kahati hai ki sari ek nijee pahanaave se kahin zyada he
 "until the 1970s, if someone went to college wearing a sari, it was treated as an adult, just like jeans are considered today
" shahari pahanaave kii style to 1870 ke dashak ke baad kii prakriya he
 The sari has undergone several stages of uniform appearance from skirt to gown
 ''33 varshiya paromita banerjee sarkaar un dinon ko yaad karti hai jab unki maa unhen kindergarten skool se lene ke liye aati thim
 She used to hold the pallu of her saree along with her mother's hand while walking with them
 usase yah abhas hota tha ki unki hifaazat ke liye maa hameshaa unke saath rahengi
 Today, Sarkar, a designer working in Kolkata, is a graduate from NID (national Institute of Design) and works in crafts and textiles
 is samay ve bhi apni sharton par sari par daavedaari jataane kii taiyaari main juty hai
 Sarkar says that years ago while she was still at NID, she read a article in a newspaper about how Banjara women are abandoning their traditional attire as a symbol of modernity and adopting saris in an attempt to elevate themselves socially while the metros In women, except saris, they are adopting kurta, palajo or tunic as a sign of modernity there
 is vidambnaa ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sarkaar ne is baat par sochna shuru kiya ki khud sari main kya badlaav aa rahe hai
 She believes that the future of saree is that it should stop treating itself as a statement and return to its roots as a natural and everyday outfit without much effort
 yah isliye bhi jaruri he ki yah hamaari jaankaree main sabase purana gaiyr sila hua pahanava he
 In 2006, designer duo Abraham & Thakore introduced their first sari workmanship — a black jamdani that conformed to Western notions of simplification of design
 unhone cycle rickshaw sareekhe rosemara ke jivan ke pratikon ko sari main buna he or dilli main unke sho kii shuruyaat jis sari se hui thi, vah aakhirkaar landan ke victoria and albert museum ne hasil kar lee
 Ten years later, Abraham & Thakore designed a large check pattern sari with long-sleeved shirt and belt to be worn as part of a show called the Fabric of India
 2015-16 main victoria and albert museum main yojit kiye gaye is sho kii curator rosemeri kril or divia patel ne sari ke sampann itihaas or uske samakaleen collection ko sanjokar pesh kiya
 In a way, it was Kavyanjali to reinterpret its mythological forms
 sho main kaale or safed check or chamkile neembui pile rang ke contrast vaali abraham and thakor kii sari pesh kii gai thi
 According to the curators of the show, the show aimed to highlight how a vibrant industry is incorporating old traditions of clothing and how sarees are getting a new look
 abraham kehete hai, ''mujhe yaad he jab handloom kii sadixan puraane paaramparik vichaaron kaa pratik maani jaati thim or sadixan aantiyaan pahana karti thim
 Then, in my mind, the saris represented an idea that was artistic, slightly leftist and was often combined with Kolhapuri chappals and bags
 or ab, achaanak sadixan 'fishan' ho gai hai
 She can be really fashionable, something that can be worn by a short-tempered young woman wearing a belt over a choli or a men's style shirt
 yah kitni shandaar baat he
 "among the designers who try out sarees are not only handloom lovers, but more
 masalan arjuna saluja jo ki rishta naam se label lekar aae hai
 He is a master of frequent experiments with pattern cutting and clothing
 unhone sili-silaai sari ke shahari rosemara ke kapade ke taur par kai dizin pesh kiye hai
 Their offerings have been very original
 sari kii kshamtaaon kaa puraa istemaal karne ke maamle main saluja shaayad sabase prayogdharmi rahe hai
 Their stitched garments embody the style of Hakama paint or even a dhoti-sari that can be worn with bomber jackets and even leather jackets
 kai myanon main yah sari ke liye ek crossover pal he
 Recognized for his hand-woven sarees (under his label Raw Mango), when Sanjay Garg first stepped out with shiny bordered Chanderi saris, no one thought that he would soon revive the traditional saree and Known as the man behind the 'maturing' of sarees in urban India
 jise ve bhartiya sarleekaran kehete hai, uske saath unke prayogon ne hi unki pariklpana ko vistrut kar diya he
 He uses the colors of Rani Pink, Sharabati, Nimbui Green, Red and Yellow to say that he always wanted to tell a story that nobody had written before
 pehle jise kabhi-kabhaar ke pahanaave ke taur par khaarij kar diya jaataa tha, vahi sari ab unki kala kii prerana ho gai thi
 Garg became part of a new hegemonic world
 fishan kii prachlit dhara main adnga lagane vaale garg kaa anusaran baaki logon ne bhi kiya
 Among them was Anavila Sindhu Mishra who says that she wore her first sari on Diwali when she was in ninth grade
 sari pahanakar ve mahasoos karne lageen ki ve tomby se achaanak ek aurat ban gai hai
 Born and raised in Karnal, Haryana, Mishra graduated from Delhi's National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) in 2000 and specialized in knitwear design
 uske baad ve korporate kshetra main kaam kar rahi thim jab gramin vikaas mantralay ne unhen madhya pradesh main nift ke saath teen saal kii ek pariyojna par kaam karne ko kaha
 She explains, "it's 2004
 main asli inasaanon ke saath kaam karne lagi thi
 My perception of giving them livelihood has changed
 uske baad main kabhi korporate jagat main laut nahin saki
 "then she plunged into the field of making saris
 unki apni kahani darasal sari ke aadhunik mahilaon ke kabird kaa hissaa banane kii kahani kii pratidhwani he
 "sari has never been more important to me," she says
 main to hameshaa hi pant-shart pahenti rahi
 i started seeing women who used to do all the work wearing saris
 main phir bahari nahin rahi or maine koshish ki mujhe ve log sweekaar kar len or tab maine sari pahananaa shuru kar diya
 In 2014, she spent 30 nights wrapping saris for the show two nights before her first show at Lakme Fashion Week
 ve kahati hai, ''aaj kii yuva mahilaayein sari nahin pahananaa chaahatin
 Now it is up to us designers to make the saree look beautiful
 mere liye to kisi sari ko is baat par khara utarana hota he ki meri ichha use pahanane kii hone lage

 com / eolswvdh31 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Two people were shot dead by unidentified assailants in Chikraul village under Rajpur police station in Buxar district of Bihar
 prashikshu ipies adhikari satya prakaash ne bataaya ki chah hamalaavaron ne chikarul gaanv sthit ek ghar main ghuskar lalan choudhary (60) or uma choudhary (45) kii goli markar hatya kar di
 Anticipating the killing of these people on the ground dispute, he said that the police have sent the dead body to the District Sadar Hospital for post-mortem and started raids to arrest the attackers
 desh ke diggaj udyogpati ratan tata ne desh main kathith rup se bad rahi ashishnutaa par chintaa jataai he
 He said that intolerance is a curse, which we have been witnessing for the last few days
 sab jaanate hai, kahaan se aa rahi he ashishnutaa: ratan tataratan tatane shuukravaar der raat kaha, 'main sochataa hum ki har vyakti jaanata he ki ashishnutaa kahaan se aa rahi he
 What is it, everyone among the thousands and millions of people in the country wants a country free from intolerance
 ’ isse pehle tata ne sindhiya skool ke 119 sthapana diwas samaaroh ko sambodhit karte hue loksabhaa main congress ke mukhya sachetak jyotiraditya sindhiya ke ashishnutaa ko lekar unki baat kaa samarthan kiya
 He said, 'maharaja (scindia) gave his views about incivility
 yah ek abhishaap he jise ham aajkal dekh rahe hai
 Tata said, "we want an environment where we love our peers
" unhen maare nahin, unhen bandhak nahin banaaen balki aapas main aadan-pradaan ke saath sadbhavnapurvak maahaul main rahen
 Prior to Tata, Scindia in his address told the students, "we want you to be the winner
" ham yah bhi chaahate hai ki aap vichaarak bane or bahes, vichaar-vimarsh or asahmati sabhy samaaj kii pahchaan hoti he
 'scindia said- Former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said that there is an atmosphere of intolerance in the country today
 congress netaa ne kaha, ‘har vyakti ko yah bataaya ja rahaa he ki use kya bolnaa he, kya sunanaa he, kya pahananaa he or kya khaanaa he
 He said that action on differences is against the progress of our society and family
 pakistan main ghuskar kar aatanki thikaanon par bhartiya vayusena ke dwaara kii gai air strike ko lekar loksabhaa chunaav kii bisaat bichaai ja rahi he
 Attending Aajtak's special forum 'suraksha Sabha', Union Minister Arun Jaitley considers the use of surgical strikes and air strikes in the promotion of political parties as wrong
 unhone kaha ki chunaav main sainikon kii tasviir kaa istemaal galat he nahin hona chahie
 i do not agree with this and those who do so should be criticized
 kendriya arun jetali ne kaha ki chunaav main sainikon ke sahare nahin ladaa janaa chahie
 Pictures of soldiers should not be placed on political platforms
 isliye chunaav ayog ne jo nirnay liya he wo sahi he
 But when it is said from the opposition that air strikes were done for political gains, it is also wrong
 pakistan ke balakot kiye gaye air strike ke sawaal par jetali ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ko jab soochna mili kii balakot main aatankiyon kii training chal rahi he
 If Jaish is preparing terrorists for an attack against India, would they have stopped watching the election? On the demand for evidence of an air strike, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that the army said that our target was right
 duniya kaa aisa koun sa desh he jo gopneey jaankaree saajha karata he? jinako war oparation kii jaankaree nahin he wo televijan dibet chalaaen ye thik nahin he
 But in politics some people are trying to bring lightness
 raksha bajet ko badaye jane ke sawaal par arun jetali ne kaha ki jab 4 fisadi hota tha tab puraa bajet 4 xxrep 4 0 karod hota tha
 But today it includes salary, OROP and other expenses
 aaj kii taarikh main hathiyaar kharid par arun jetali ne kaha ki is baar airforce ne pakistan kii seemaa main khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa main jaakar sateek prahaar kiya
 With this attack we broke the concept that India would maintain the sanctity of the Line of Control, because after our action, no nation of the world criticized us
 vajah ye thi ki hamane ehtiyathan hamale kiye jisamen nirdosh logon yaa pakistan kii sena ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya
 We targeted only the terrorist camps there
 dilli main aam aadmi party sarkaar banaaegi or mukhyamantri honge arvind kejariwal

 harshavardhan ne di shubhakamana, saath main saadhaa nishanajise hi aam aadmi party ne dilli main sarkaar banane kii ghoshnaa kii unhen shubhakamanaayen milane lageen
 Former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit and BJP CM Ummadivar Dr
 harshavardhan ne kejariwal ko badhai di
 However, both the leaders did not forget to target this excuse
 shila dikshit ne kaha ki congress ne bina shart samarthan nahin diya he
 Our support is based on issues
 ab ye unki jimmedaari he ki jo bade-bade vaade kiye hai unhen puraa kiya jaae
 At the same time, Harsh Vardhan said that against whom Kejriwal laid the foundation of his politics by raising his voice, today he is going to form a government by joining hands with the same Congress
 aapako bataa den ki dilli vidhansabha chunaavon main kisi bhi party ko bahumat nahin mila
 The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 32 seats
 vahiin aam aadmi party ko 28 seat mili or congress ko maatr 8 siton se santosh karnaa padaa
 The Lieutenant Governor first invited the BJP to form the government although the party ruled out the possibility citing lack of majority
 ab baari ai aam aadmi party kii
 At first, Kejriwal's party kept talking about not taking any support from the Congress or the BJP, but on the last occasion, the Congress sent a letter to him to give an unconditional support from outside
 iske baad aam aadmi party ne is samarthan ko lekar puri dilli main janamat sangrah karaayaa jiske aadhaar par somvaar ko sarkaar banane kaa faisla kiya gaya
 In the BJP, the Yogi government has banned illegal slaughterhouses and the police have closed most illegal slaughterhouses

 bif banpar party ke alag-alag netaaon ke alag-alag stand ne ise kaaphi pechida bana diya he
 a few days ago, the BJP leader of Manipur made it clear that there would be no beef ban
 mallapuram main bijepi ke ummidavaar en shriprakash ne kaha, 'meri taraf se yah koshish hogi saaf-suthere boojadkhaane acchhee quality kaa bif kii supplai sunishchit ho
 'surprisingly, the BJP member accused the Congress of banning cow slaughter while in power in many states
 shriprakash ne kaha ki jin rajyon main gohatya par roak lagi he vahaan bif khaanaa gaiyrkanoonee he
 It is worth noting here that after the bjp's landslide victory in UP, the Yogi government has launched a campaign to stop illegal slaughterhouses
 bijepi shasit 5 or rajyon ne upi ke is kadam ko apane rajyon main bhi lagu kar diya he lekin jin rajyon main bif par bain nahin he vahaan bijepi ke netaa is mudde ko darkinar kar rahe hai
 There is no restriction on the sale and consumption of cow meat in Kerala

 On Monday evening, a batch of Amarnath pilgrims was attacked in Anantnag, Kashmir, in which 7 passengers died and 19 others were injured

 After the attack, the country came to know that the driver Salim saved the life of the remaining passengers in the bus
 khud gujarat ke mukhyamantri vijay roopani ne bhi saleem kii is baat ke liye tarif kii
 Vijay Rupani, who arrived at the Surat airport on Tuesday to pay tribute to the passengers killed in the attack, said that he thanked them for the way the driver drove the bus away from the reach of the terrorists for two kilometers without stopping
 unhone driver ko veerta puraskaar dene kii bhi maang kii
 But apart from all this, there is a section on social media that is trying to blame Salim for the attack
 aise post or massej bheje ja rahe hai jisamen saleem ko shaq ke saath dekhne kii baat kahi ja rahi he yaa isse aage badhate hue use hi hamale ke liye jimmedaar tehraaya ja rahaa he
 One thing to be noted on this whole issue is that a group of Amarnath pilgrims comes out from Gujarat and there is a Salim among the drivers who take this batch from Gujarat to Amarnath
 hamaare samaaj ke liye yah ek aam baat he lekin pichley kuch samay se desh ke bheetar jis tarah ke halaat paidaa karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he us vajah se is bare main baat karnaa jaruri ho jaataa he

 Was a Hindu and a Muslim

 jab hamane unase poocha ki kya yatriyon ko is baat se koi fark padaa tha ki wo jis bas main ja rahe hai uskaa ek driver saleem he? is sawaal ko sunate hi yogesh naaraaz ho gaye
 He angrily said to us, 'look
 
 
 ye baat hamaare liye yaa kisi bhi duusare yatri ke liye bilkul myne nahin rakhti
 We all knew that Salim was going with us
 wo hamaare bas kaa driver he lekin isse ham main se kisi ko fark nahin padaa
 'yogesh further adds,' Why the people who are doing hindu-muslim do not understand that they are destroying them all
 ’yogesh kii baat se ye to saaf he ki hamaare samaaj kaa ek bada hissaa jis tarah se sochataa he, soshal media par baithe kuch log, kisi bhi mudde ko lekar kattar ruukh rakhane vaale log yaa kuch netaa usase bilkul itar sochate hai
 In order to understand this behavior of society better, we spoke to renowned Hindi litterateur Anil Yadav
 hamane unase poocha ki is vyavhaar ko kaise samajha jaae? jawaab main anil bole, 'dekhie

 Earlier, Naik had also lodged a report with the police against Human Resource Minister m Kulasegaran and four others on Friday
 nike ne police main darj karai report main kaha ki in paanchon ne uske 8 agast ko die bayaan ko tod marod kar pesh kiya
 Naik has sent notices to Ramasamy, Muniandi, Ignatius and Santiago through the law company, citing some of his articles and press releases
 nike ke mutabik iff lekhon or press relies se uski avmaananaa hui he
 Earlier in a police report, Naik claimed that he had praised Malaysia for how it treats 'hindu minorities' and protects their rights
 malaysia main nike kii jamkar aalochana ho rahi he
 115 police reports have been lodged against him across the country after his alleged statement to the minorities of Malaysia
 pehle bhi nike ke kathith taur par die ek bayaan ko lekar kaaphi vivaad hua tha
 It is alleged that Naik had said that the Indian community living in Malaysia is more supportive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India than the Malaysian Prime Minister Dr
 Mahathir Mohammad
 nike par ye bhi aarope he ki usne muslim bahul malaysia main alpsankhyak hinduon or chini mul ke logon ke khilaaf bhadakaau bayaanbazi kar desh kii shanti bhang karne kii koshish kii
 Naik reportedly also said that the status of minority Hindus in Malaysia is better than that of minority Muslims in India
 nike ke pratyrpan ke liye bharat ne purv main malaysia se aagrah kiya tha
 India is looking for him due to allegations of money laundering
 kendriya soochna ayog ne raksha mantralay ko nirdesh diya he ki vah un mantriyon or adhikariyon ke naamon kaa khulaasa kare jinhone puraane pad gaye chah helicopteron kii kharid ke liye manjuuri di thi
 It was also criticized by the CAG
 bhartiya nausena ne soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon ke tahat maangi gayi jaankaree dene se inkaar kar diya tha or kanoon kii dhara 8 :1:e: kaa hawala dete hue kaha tha ki is sambandh main soochna kaa khulaasa hone se rashtriya suraksha prabhavit ho sakati he

 agar aap chaatr hai or kisi pariksha system se guzar rahe hai to aapako maaloom he ki yahaan sirf pariksha hi nahin deni hoti he
 There is hardly any country in the world, and you can ask any non-resident Indian, where there is so much news of rigging about the examinations
 main kareeb do saal se is tarah ke vishyon par prime time kar rahaa hum
 i pass through hundreds of messages and pictures every day
 ghanton inhen padhata rahata hum
 i want you to listen carefully and there is no need to give a Nobel on this research
 iskaa nishkarsh yah he ki aap in pariksha system ke zarie bharat ke karodon naujavaanon kii zindagi paanch se das saal tak barbaad kar sakate hai
 There are very few examinations then completed in less than a year
 yani jwining tak pahunchati hai
 Most exams are completed in at least two years and at most five years
 is bich kuch parikshaayen laapata ho jaati hai
 Meaning the form was filled, the examination was done and the result is not known for eight years
 aap kisi bhi non resident indian se puuchhie ki kya ve is system main apane bacchon ko daalana chahenge, unki neend ud jaaegi
 There is also a second part of my research
 kya in parikshaon kii dhaandhlee se pareshaan naujavaanon kii raajnneetik chetana alag hoti he?is sawaal kaa sandarbh yah he ki aam taur par ham samajhate hai ki youth koi alag raajnneetik praani hota he
 There is assertiveness in his political consciousness
 bilkul yah baat galat he
 Is a lie balki maine dekha he ki chaatro ne unheen sarkaron ko chunaa he, yaa unki raajnneetik vichaardhaara vahi rahati he jiske changul main funs kar ve paanch yaa chah saal tak imhataan hi dete rahete hai
 Neither the result comes nor the recruitment
 isliye sarkaron ko bhi fark nahin padataa he
 The political party that runs them knows that the youngster knows that the result of the exam has not come, even if rigged, he will talk about his caste and religion first
 ek line main kahuun to naujavaanon kaa barbaad hona unke raajnneetik faisle kaa hissaa hota hi nahin he
 This is amazing original research, which i have done myself
 or noujvaan bhi ise satyapit karte hai ki main thik kah rahaa hum
 Therefore governments do not have to worry at all
 aisa nahin ki ve mare kehane se chintaa nahin karengi balki unhen yah baat thik thik pataa he
 If you wish, do research separately, taking students who have been put in the system of government examination in any state

 Some private coaching centers may have a hand

 The verdict referred to such news printed in the media
 kaha gaya he karnataka main bhi medical college ke admician main frod kii khabaren chhapi hai
 In a way, the purpose of making CBI a party is to have an investigation in the entire country because someone else has given the exam instead of the student and this exam has been done in another state
 is maamle main kisi ke badale pariksha dene vaala jise angrezi main impersonator kehete hai, giraftaar nahin hua he

 According to media reports, 185 seats have been sold in these four colleges in Karnataka for 100 to 125 crores
 ek medical seat ke liye 50 se 60 lakh liye gaye hai
 Obviously this network should be investigated

 We find the best doctor at the time of illness, but while making a doctor, we make anyone a doctor by paying money
 aise samaaj main aap kya ummid karte hai
 The judges see the game of coaching centers in this entire network
 isliye unhone poocha he ki kitne aise chaatr hai jinka pehali baar main admician hota he or kitne aise hai jinka kai kai baar ke prayaas main hota he

 In Tamil Nadu, medical was first granted on a board basis
 itnaa number kaaphi tha anita kaa doctor banane ke liye
 If formed, Anita would be the first doctor of her community and village
 usee saal tamilnadu main neet pariksha kaa system lagu hua he
 Anita's father is a daily wage laborer
 anita neet ke kilaaf supreme court gai ki yah system garib chaatro ke khilaaf he
 Anita committed suicide

 Later, a library was also built in memory of Anita at a cost of 45 lakhs but Anita's fight did not reach anywhere

 According to media reports, 6 children have committed suicide due to NEET in Tamil Nadu in the last two and a half years hence there is a movement that their state should be kept separate from NEET as NEET promotes private coaching system
 usamen garib chaatr peeche rah jate hai

 Raghuraman of the Chennai Bureau of the Times of India reported today, 17 October
 usamen raghuraaman ne bataaya he ki kai baar neet dene vaale chaatr isliye paas hote hai kyonki unhen is pariksha ke system kii samaj bhi aa jaati he
 According to their report, only 12 percent passed the exam many times
 is saal yah number badhkar 70 pratishat ho gaya he
 This data shows how the coaching industry is growing due to NEET
 raghuraaman ne likhaa he ki sirf teen saal main tamilnadu main neet koching ke das hazaar se adhik training centre shuru ho gaye hai
 a turnover of more than 500 crores has been made
 dehradun ke parade ground main rajya ke tamaam bade kaarykram yojit kiye jate hai lekin in dinon parade ground par uttarakhand ke lagbhag sabhi nijee ayurvedic collejon ke chaatr dharne or aamaran anshan par baithe hai
 The health of many of these students has also deteriorated
 in chaatro ne pehle apane-apane collejon main virodh pradarshan kiye or ab parade ground par baithne ko majaboor hai
 These students demand that the Uttarakhand government's mandate of 2015 be withdrawn in which the fees of private Ayurvedic medical colleges were increased from 80 thousand to 2 lakh 15 thousand
 aapako bataa den ki supreme court ke ek aadesh ke mutabik fees badhanaa rajya sarkaar ke adhikaar kshetra main nahin he
 This right belongs to the Fee Determination Committee which is constituted in every state under the chairmanship of a retired judge of the High Court
 lekin rajya sarkaar ne isaki parvaah kiye bagair shasnadesh jari kar diya
 Students appealed against the mandate in Uttarakhand High Court in Nainital
 hycourt kii single jaj bench ne sarkaar ko aadesh diya ki wo chaatro se liya gaya badha hua shulk waapas kare
 The fees should not be increased from the back date and from 2019 onwards, the fee fixation committee should decide
 single bench ke is faisale ke virodh main nijee collejon ne hycourt main apil kii
 The two-judge bench of the High Court also upheld the decision of the single bench and ordered the withdrawal of the increased fees once again
 iske baavjood nijee college maanane ko taiyaar nahin hue or chaatro par lagaataar badi hui fees dene kaa dabaav banaaya jaataa rahaa
 Many students were also persecuted for protesting
 hycourt kaa aadesh lagu nahin hua to chaatro ne hycourt ke aadesh kii avmaananaa kii arzi daayar kar di
 The contempt application was heard and the High Court ordered private colleges to implement the old court order
 lekin college maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Let us tell you that in Uttarakhand there is a private Ayurvedic college named Patanjali Yogpeeth of Baba Ramdev, there are many other colleges in which the state's well-known politicians and industrialists have money
 is maamle par uttarakhand main satta paksh or vipaksh donon hi ek saath khadey hai kyonki hycourt ke aadesh ko lekar vipaksh bhi chuppi saadhe hue he
 The apathy of the Chancellor of the Uttarakhand Governor in this case is also incomprehensible, while the students and their parents have appealed to him many times and conveyed the seriousness of the matter but nobody cared about the students

 Thanks to MCD for taking action immediately
 shikshakon ko laga ki rasta saaf ho gaya he magar aaj unki jwoining nahin hui or na hi unhen kuch bataaya gaya
 So they have been sitting on this dharna for three days
 aakhir manoj tiwari ke twit ke anusaar ek zone main niyukti ho gai to baaki zone main kyon nahin hui
 While among these teachers, the chairman of the standing committee of MCD also assured that joining will take place on 17th
 unhen nigam ayukta se milanaa hoga
 But 17 did not join
 manoj tiwari ko bhi pataa karnaa chahie hua kya

 uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar pichhadon ko milane vaale 27 fisadi aarakshan main bada pherbadal karne ja rahi he
 It is believed that its real purpose is to air the SP-BSP alliance in UP so that the BJP can repeat its 2014 performance in the 2019 elections
 haalanki yogi ke mantri om prakaash rajbhar ne sarkaar ke is sikret plan kaa abhi se khulaasa kar diya he

 obisi cote kaa phayda kise?obisi aarakshan kaa sabase zyada phayda yadav samudaay ko mil rahaa he
 This is the reason why there is resentment among people of non-yadav OBC caste

 Book: Ishq Mein Shahar Hain (laprek) Author: Ravish kumarpicture: Vikram nayakpublicar: Rajkamal Publication Price: Rs 99 Ravish Kumar was taking a 'selfie' with his hometown Nayana
 unke ‘selfi’ lene ke pal ko main or saath ke kuch log apane phone main utaarne kii koshish karne lage
 Amidst taking a 'selfie', Raveesh's eyes fall on us while taking a picture
 aaj ‘ishk main shahar hona’ kitaab ko puraa pard lene ke baad mujhe wo nigaah chubh rahi he
 i did the same thing that happens in cities with loving couples
 unka ekant chhinana
 Staring at the moments of love, taking out an X-ray
 is baat kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr ki ye nigahen un jodon ko aapas main ghulne-milane kii bajaay maance nochane kaa ehsaas kara rahi hoti hongi
 On that day, in a program of 'ishq Mein Shahar Hohana', i would not have understood this book better if Ravish had not noticed me
 shukriya raveesh us nigaah or ‘ishk main shahar hona’ kitaab ke liye
 Now we have moved from the town to the city to flirt and see the people who flirt
 ‘dilli main mahfuj jagah kii talash do hi tarah ke log karte hai, jinhen prem karnaa he or jinhen prem karte hue logon ko dekhnaa he
 Both got up so fast in panic that there was a stir in the nearby bushes
 premiyon ko laga ki police aa gai he
 He said, remember what kind of city is this? Keeps chasing the body all the time
 ’raveesh kumaar or chitrakaar vikram nayak kii kitaab ‘ishk main shahar hona’ hamen hamase milaati he
 It is very important to meet yourself
 khud se mili bina ham dusron se behatar tareeke se nahin mil sakate hai, ishk nahin nibhaa sakate hai
 With every short love story (laprek) in the book, the pictures made by Vikram remain like a silent mashuka in the story, who simply says everything with his expressions and lines
 or is mashooqa ke saath raveesh ke laprek kisi nae-nae aashiq kii tarah pyaar main bevajaah kii jane vaali mithi baaten karte rahete hai
 These things connect us to the book
 kahin khud ishk main aise ehsaason se guzarane kii vajah se to kahin premi jodon ko khud ke ghurne kii vajah se
 'being a city in Ishq' gives us the reason why we can find moments of love and happiness without staying low in budget and with simplicity in Ishq
 ‘ishk main sirf dekhnaa hi nahin hota
 Ignoring also happens
 ’yun to rashk hota he ki koi kaise itani saadagi se ishk ko itane kam shabdon main bayaan kar saktaa he
 In Ravish's story there is no beautiful, crazy
 premika cinema haul nahin hoti he
 Because when you and we too are in love, there is nothing for anyone
 bas jo khud hote hai wo bane rahete hai
 Even true love keeps us
 ‘ishk main shahar hona’ hamen apane apane shaharon ke wo ajanabi hisse dikhaati he, jo pehali najar se dekhne par to sirf metro kaa khambha yaa barish hone par chhipane ke liye fliover kaa nichalaa hissaa maatr hota he
 But from the point of view of 'hobby-e-didar', this place gives us a deeper feeling than the gift of Taj Mahal in minutes
 ‘jaan-pahchaan kii jagahon se anjaan jagah janaa hi ishk main shahar hona he
 Who is the original here
 yah jo tumhaare mere bich prem he, vah na jane isse pehle kitnon ke bich ghat chukaa he
 'the book we read often
 uske achche pannon ko ham mode dete hai
 Believe that when you have completed this book, then your book will be thick because of almost every page folded like my book
 yaa pan se neeli yaa kaali
 Underline to save from beautiful pictures of Vikram Nayak
 ishk main killat vaale dinon main ye kitaab rooyee ke naram phahon kii tarah aapako waapas ishk main bhigoegi
 'let's do something for Ishq
 aamtaur par pipal ke ped ke neeche kab tak chhipate rahenge ham? jamun bhi girtaa he to lagata he kisi khap kii goli lag rahi he
 The book "being a city in Ishq" is also important for us to read
 kyonki hamane ishk ko kuch simaaon main samet rakhaa he
 Some of his connotations have been set
 jabaki ishk main seemaa jaisaa kuch hota hi nahin he
 There are only two people
 in logon ke bich kuch baaten hoti hai
 There are battles
 chuppi hoti he
 While in love, there is also a feeling of not talking, going from a neck to a chest
 ye ehsaas premi jodon ke aapas main baat na karne ke baad bhi ye yakeen dilaataa he ki ham ishk main hai or na baat karnaa bhi ishk kii iemai he, jise bharna jaruri he taaki uski keemat kaa ehsaas hota rahe, paa lene ke baad bhi
 'then what do you know? That is what we say to spread garbage
 ishk main khamoshi ke do pal bhi saaf ho gaye to bachegaa kya? safai yaa kachra?'‘chhatarpur kii gufaaon main chalate-chalate ek duusare ke liye mannaten maangate donon apni chahat ko khwamkhah bhakthi main badalane lage
 He pretends to stay in a dark cave, he is afraid
 sparsh us aashirwad kii tarah hota jisaki kaamana ve mandiron main karte rahete’is kitaab ko padhate vakt sabase dilachasp tathy to ye he ki in laprekon ko kitaab ke liye nahin, bas khud se yaa sirf kah dene ke liye raveesh ne fasebuk par likh diya tha
 Reading these ellipses helps one to imagine Ishq's own past or future
 akele baithkar apane mohabbat ke kisson ko yaad kar muskaraane kii vajah milti he
 The role of the book is strong
 ye bhoomika ishk ko sochane kii nai vajah detii he
 'why do you get angry? main brake le luun
 In the break itself, my questions go to Bath with Lux and Liril and when they return, wearing a Dora vest
 uff, yah ankar aashiq-awara ho gaya he
 Hey you can't leave tv No, it is respiratory disease
 yahi chhodkar jaaegi mujhe, main nahin
 
 
 
 
 
 ’
 After reading this line in a wrap, i started thinking what will happen when this white haired person is no more
 tab tak raveesh ne kya kuch kah diya hoga, kitna kuch rah gaya hoga
 
 fasebuk, twitor stats, khabaron, reporton, kitabon or jindagi main
 Ravish's as well as ours
 ye sab soch hi rahaa tha ki aankh ke ‘simapuri border’ par ek aansu sa aa gaya
 The tear did not come down the path of the eye, but while writing, it is still stuck on the throat
 pehle sochaa ye baat na likhuun
 People can be called a show or buttermilk because of their profession
 par main likh paaya kyonki dil se ek aawaaj si ai, ’ishk main shahar sirf premika yaa premi ke nahin hua jaataa he
 People of choice are also made
 ghurti najaron kii parvaah karne lagunga to ishk main shahar hokar khud ko or pyaar ko mahasoos nahin kar paaungaa
 In the same appeal, the lover gave a loving reply with the right to stop breathing
 
 
 
 Quiet wretched! ' sibiai ke naediarector anil sinhane saaf kar diya he ki ve kisi bhi dabaav main aane vaale nahi hai
 Their motive is to carry out their work with honesty
 sinha ne is baat par bhi jor diya ki jaanch agency is baat kaa dhyaan rakhegi ki kisi bekasoor kaa shoshan na ho
 On 2 December, Anil Sinha, who took charge as the head of the country's largest investigative agency, joined 'agenda Aaj Tak' today
 media kii surkhiyaan or sibiai kii chhavi ko lekar anil sinha ne kaha, 'jo yahaan nahin hai unke bare main baaten karnaa munasib nahin he
 Whenever we make headlines, we will give it in the right cases
 hamaare jo adhikari hai unhen ek hi cheez kahi he ki nishpakshta se kaam karen
 If we do such work, people's trust will increase
 kuch log santusht hongen, kuch nahin
 But we must satisfy the court with facts and evidence
 ham kisi kii parvaah kyon karen
 Yes, it is important to keep in mind that no innocent is exploited
 jo galat hai unke khilaaf kadi karrwai hogi
 On the question of pressure in cases involving white-collar people, Anil Sinha said, 'you saw us stagger somewhere in the case? When we work on such a case we examine it closely
 kabhi bhi hadabadi or jaldbaaji main kaam nahin karte
 If you go with a particular mindset, the results are not good
 court ko santusht karnaa hota he
 Therefore we consider it necessary to do every aspect of our work in a better way
 sibiai nideshak ne apni team kii tarif karte hue kaha ki hamaare paas chuninda logon kii umdaa team he
 Selected officers of the country have been taken
 hamane hameshaa sandesh diya he ki jo kaam he, use achche se karen
 Do not worry about the result
 dabaav main naa aaen bas achche se kaam karen
 Do your work fearlessly and move forward
 sinha ne kaha ki sibiai har saal takreeban 1200 maamalon par jaanch karti he
 Every case is important for us
 hamaari praathamikta rahati he ki chaahe chota cese ho yaa bada, chaahe wo hedline bane yaa naa bane
 We handle everyone well
 bhrashtachar ke maahaul main hamaari jimmedaari or bad jaati he ki ham behatar tareeke se kaam karen
 Regarding his tenure in SPG, Sinha said that if we make a mistake there, there can be big loss
 isaliye achche se kaam karte hai
 We have to keep many such things in mind there too
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki kisi bhi khaas cese ke bare main yahaan baat karnaa sahi nahin hoga lekin ek baat kahana he ki har desh ke kanoon alag hote hai
 In today's date, it would not be appropriate to tell on which case we are working and how far we have reached
 kuch baaten hoti hai jo logon tak nahin jaani chahie
 They cannot be made public
 sibiai ke beja istemaal par anil sinha ne kaha ki unhe special diarector banane se pehle kareeb 35 saal police main kaam karne kaa anubhav he
 Never received any direction
 jo kuch kiya khud kiya, apane vichaar se kiya
 Some people may have expected it, but i had no such experience
 maine koi pressure nahin dekha
 Regarding the Saradha chit fund case of West Bengal, Sinha said, 'we do our work
 kise suut karata he, kise suut nahin karata, isse hamen matlab nahin
 Neither did anyone tell me anything nor did we say anything to anyone
 ham tathyon ke aadhaar par karrwai kar rahe hai
 We are doing our work with complete honesty
 sibiai diarector ne kaha, 'jo cese hote hai wo sabhi court ke paas hote hai
 There are a few select cases, which the Supreme Court monitors
 usase phayda hota he
 Sometimes we are able to see something that is missing
 seekhney ko miltaa he
 We cannot judge the decision of the court
 'supreme court se milane vaali fatkaar par sinha bole ki kaam agar puraa yaa thik nahin kiya to fatkaar honi chahie
 If you get reprimand, then it should be taken positive
 kaam ko behatar se kiya janaa chaiye
 What would we do if there was a scolding in the house? In the special case, he said that we have created a SIT which is capable of handling the case
 aise or bhi cese hai jin par ham kaam kar rahe hai
 We asked the team to examine all the evidence
 sahi kaam karnaa he sahi kaam praathamikta he
 On matters going on in the states, he said that when something big is happening, it is not that we are unaware of them
 ham apane database ke liye kaam karte hai lekin ham kisi or ke kaam main dakhal den ye munasib nahin hoga
 Anil Sinha gave a clear message that to fight corruption in the country, one has to fight with greed inside
 khud par kaabo rakhana hoga
 Because of this, cases travel
 main power kii kami par unhone kaha ki 'inf kabhi nahin hota
 Everyone has to contend with deficiency
 jo he use sahi se istemaal karen
 Where there is a need, we also get it from the government
 abhi jo hamaare paas he wo kaaphi naa hote hue bhi itane sakasham hai ki saare cese par achche se kaam kar saken
 Regarding his appointment, he said that he had no idea that he would become the director of CBI
 unhone kaha, 'mujhe nahin pataa tha mujhe bhukh lagi thi
 i was going to have food
 tivi par parivaar ne dekha par vishwaas nahin hua
 i was convinced when i received a notification from dopt at half past one in the night
 mere dimag main aayaa ki badi jimmedaari mujhe di gai he
 God help me to do the right thing
 bas yahi prarthana kii
 The CBI chief said that music adds color to life
 lekin jo badrang karne vaali chijen hai, unase mukkamal ladaai ladane kii jarurat he
 So that we do not have any kind of loss

 amravati ko andhra pradesh kii rajdhani banane main bada ghotaalaa kiya gaya he or yah kiya he chandrababu naidu ne
 The charge was made by YSR Congress leader Jaganmogan Reddy who reached India Today Conclave
 reddy se ajtak ke news diarector rahul kanwal ne sawaal poocha tha ki agar aap siem banate hai to kya andhra pradesh kii rajdhani ko amravati hi rahane denge yaa isko badal denge
 Answering this question, Jaganmohan explained in detail what kind of scam has been done behind declaring Amravati as the capital
 reddy ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki andhra pradesh ke siem chandrababu naidu kii company ne yahaan par kisaanon se oune-paune daam par pehle jameen kharidi
 When the land was purchased, the farmers there were unaware that Amravati could also be declared the capital
 rajdhani ghoshit hone ke baad land pool ke madhyam se yah jameen le lee gai
 It was then sold to different people at higher prices
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki desh ne dekha he ki kis tarah tailangana ke 22 vidhayakon ko paisa diya gaya
 He also has audio and video tapes but no action was taken on anyone
 jaganmohan reddy ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki 6 maheene pehle congress ne ek pustika jari kii thi jis par rahul gandhi kii photo thi
 In this, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu was described as the most corrupt CM
 unke ek bhrastachar kaa khulaasa kiya gaya tha lekin 3 maheene baad hi congress ne telugudesham se samjhauta kar liya
 Questioning the Congress, Jaganmohan said that the Congress fought against Telugu Desam for 30 years and today joined hands with him
 iskaa public main kaisaa sandesh jayega
 On the question of whether he will go with the Congress or not, Jaganmohan said that we are not against Rahul Gandhi
 lekin ham kisi par vishwaas nahin karnaa chaahate, kyonki ham pehle hi paanch saal kho chuke hai
 Congress is over in Andhra Pradesh
 congress ko hamaari jarurat he hamen unki jarurat nahin he
 Congress does not believe in itself, otherwise what was the rationale for alliance with that party which fought against TDP for 30 years
 jaganmohan ne kaha ki jo andhra pradesh ko special katigari kaa darja degaa unki party uskaa hi samarthan karegi chaahe vah koi bhi ho

 The first major test for 0 elections in 51 assembly seats in 17 states and 1 union territory, by-election in Satara in Maharashtra and Samastipur Lok Sabha seat in Bihar, is the magic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi fading due to economic slowdown or sluggishness? Or Modi's attraction has not diminished despite all the negative news of the economy like unemployment, sales, decline in production? This will also be decided by the by-elections of 2 Lok Sabha including 378 Legislative Assembly of Maharashtra and Haryana and 51 Legislative Assembly of several states being held in the country today

 The Congress today released a three-year-old video clip, in which Uma Bharti had allegedly called Narendra Modi an agent of destruction and termed his Gujarat development claim as 'hypocrisy'
 uma us samay bhaajapa se alag ho gai thim or bhartiya janashakti party kii adhyaksh thim
 In the audio video presentation, Uma said that he has never seen Hindus as frightened as he has seen in Gujarat
 gujarat ab bhayakrant rajya ban gaya he
 Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi has admitted that the video CD was from a time when Uma was not in the BJP
 isamen uma gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke vikaas or hindutv ke daawey ko khaarij karti najar aa rahi hai
 "I have known him since 1973
 
 He is not a development man but a malevolence

 ' uma ne is video main kaha, ‘

 Regarding the video clip, Singhvi said that Uma did not say these things during the election
 agar koi chunaav ke dinon main is tarah tippanee nahin karata to iskaa matlab he ki usamen adhik sachai he
 There is no denying what he said
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke bare main ye tippaniyan uma bharti jaisi varisht netaa ne kii hai
 Asked why the party released these cds at the time of elections, Singhvi said that although this is not the main point of the press conference of the All India Congress Committee, but it shows that there are thousands of people in the BJP, who Modi The dictators believe it, the men believe destruction and believe that their claims about Gujarat development are false

 The disputed lyrics of a Congress MLA in Rajasthan have been disputed
 vidhayak raamalaal meena ne purv mukhyamantri or bhartiya janata party kii varisht netaa vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf tippanee kii he, jiskaa video viral ho gaya he
 In this video, Congress is saying that CM Vasundhara Raje could not do development work during her tenure, because she was busy in some other work
 pratapgarh vidhansabha seat se pehali baar congress vidhayak bane raamalaal meena ne ravivaar ko veeravali main jansamasya kii sunwaayee ke dauraan kathith rup se kaha tha ki vasundhara raaje sharaab kii bottle kholane main vyast rahi jabaki vikaas kaary baadhit rahaa
 In the video which went viral on social media, Meena said, "applause should be played for the work being done by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot
 unhone (gahalot ne) satta sambhalate hi sahi disha main kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 Vasundhara Raje was busy opening liquor bottles and did not work
 'congress vidhayakaki is tippanee ko amaryadit mana ja rahaa he or rajya kii siyasat main unke is bayaan par bavaal much gaya he
 It has not been even a month to the Congress government, in such a situation, such rhetoric of the ruling party MLA has become part of the controversy
 bataa den ki disambar 2018 main rajya main hue vidhansabha chunaav main pratapgarh vidhansabha seat par raamalaal meena ne bhaajapa ke hemanth meena ko 16680 maton se haraakar jeet darj kii thi
 The bugle of panchayat elections in Uttarakhand is over
 haridwar jile ko chhodkar rajya ke baaki 12 jilon ke tristareey panchayat chunaavon main teen charnon main chunaav hone hai
 The total number of voters in these districts is 43,11,423
 ye voter jila panchayat, kshetra panchayat or gram panchayat ke kul 66,399 padon ke liye matdaan karenge
 In this, these voters will directly elect Gram Pradhan, Gram Panchayat member, Kshetra Panchayat member and Zilla Panchayat member
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii rajya sarkaar ne in chunaavon ko lekar pesh panchayat raaj sanshodhan adhinium paarit karakar do se adhik bacchon ke mata-pita ko chunaav ladgaye se rokane kaa prabandh kiya tha
 But the Nainital High Court invalidated it for the election of village head
 is nirnay ko vishesh anumati yachika ke jariye bhaajapa sarkaar ne supreme court main chunauti di, lekin vahaan bhi koi raahat nahin mili
 The Supreme Court refused to stay the High Court verdict
 ye chunaav soobe ke mukhyamantri trivendra singh ravat ke liye kisi agnipariksha se kam nahin hai
 It will be a challenge for the BJP to continue its run in these three-tier panchayat elections, which have been winning the success of the 2017 assembly elections
 in chunaavon ke parinaam ko mukhyamantri ke dhaai saal ke kaamkaaj kaa report card bhi mana jayega
 The BJP also won local bodies, municipal elections, cooperative elections to bye-elections and Lok Sabha elections during this period and the Chief Minister redeemed them as a public seal on his tenure
 haalanki, yah bhi hakeekat he ki amuman sattarudh party hi soobe main panchayat chunaav jitati rahi he
 Of the twelve districts in which the three-tier panchayat elections are to be held, six districts are important in terms of the seats of the district panchayat and the village head
 isi kaaran rajya ke rajnatik dalon kaa dhyaan in chah jilon main sabase zyada he
 These six districts are - Almora, Tehri, Pithoragarh, Pauri, Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar
 inamen jila panchayat sadasyon kii 30 se zyada siten hai
 In hilly districts like Almora and Tehri, the seats of Zilla Panchayat members are more than those of Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar
 in donon hi jagahon par jila panchayat sadasyon kii siten 45-45 hai, jabaki dehradun main 30 or udhamsingh nagar se 35 jila panchayat sadsy chunakar aate hai
 At the same time, there are also districts like Champawat, where there are only 15 Zilla Panchayat seats
 bhaajapa ne jahaan pradesh main majboot sanghathan khadaa kiya he, vahiin rajya ke mukhya vipakshi dal congress ke sanghathan kaa haal yah he ki pradesh adhyaksh chune gaye preetam singh abhi tak nai kaaryakarini tak nahin bana sake hai
 In such a situation, it is not difficult to guess the weak position of the Congress organization
 yahi kaaran he ki in chunaavon se thik pehle bhi kai congressi netaa party chhodkar bhaajapa main chale gaye hai
 Instead of strengthening its organization, the Congress is claiming to win the three-tier panchayat elections on the basis of the government's mistakes
 rajnatik prekshkon ke mutabik, ye chunaav congress ke liye is lihaaj se bhi mahatvapurn hai kyonki 2022 ke vidhansabha chunaavon se pehle hone vaale ye aakhri chunaav hai
 The seats won in these elections will give political parties a chance to show their support in the state
 isi kaaran bhaajapa kaa sanghathan in chunaavon ko gambhirtha se letaa najar aa rahaa he
 Despite this, Congress state president Pritam Singh claims that the people of the state are not satisfied with the utterances and actions of the BJP government
 unka kahana he, ''janata ke bich aakrosh badhata ja rahaa he, iskaa sidhaa laabh congress ko milegaa
 The party is moving forward under a definite strategy for elections
 iske nattejey bataa denge ki bhaajapa kii jamini hakeekat kya he
 "at the same time, BJP state president Ajay Bhatt says," People are hopeful about the policies of the Modi government at the center and the Trivandra government in the state

 When Gandhiji removed the hands of the two girls to answer the greetings of the crowd, at the same time a man came forward ripping the crowd from the right
 manu ne uskaa haath pakadakar use rokna chaha, parantu usne manu ko jor se jhatak diya or pranaam kii mudra main haath jodakar gandhi ji ke saamne jhukate hue apane saat kaartoos vaale pistaul se ek ke baad ek teen goliyaan chalaayin
 He did so close that one of the bullets fired was later found in the folds of Gandhiji's clothes

 This question arising out of the lawyer's intelligence seems to divert attention from the basic facts in hypocrisy

 He shook his head with anguish
 abha or manu foot-foot kar rone lageen
 'gandhiji did not want the body to be dissected in the next part of the question, Swami asked why Bapu's post-mortem was not done
 Perhaps Swami will remember that when Bapu's kidneys had almost stopped functioning during the last fast, Bapu refused to take any kind of medicine while taking any kind of injection

 Gandhiji, who was opposed to body worship, further writes, 'it has been suggested that Gandhiji's body should be kept in a spice for at least a few days for darshan

 Mountbatten further said, "if Gandhiji had lived his whole life and would have been awarded a simple death with respect, it would have been perfectly right

 Patel questioned the RSS Another thing Swamy raised in Parliament was that in a letter to Nehru, Sardar Patel had described the RSS as free from the guilt of killing Gandhiji
 lekin swami ne yah nahin bataaya ki isi patr main patel ne kaha tha ki aresas ko nishchit taur par apane baaki paapon ke liye kathghare main khadaa kiya jayega
 And Swami deliberately forgot Patel's letters written before and after which the RSS was blamed for Gandhi's assassination
 swami panne palaten to unhen 18 july 1948 ko shyamaprasad mukherjee kaa likhaa sardaar kaa patr milegaa, jisamen sardaar ne saaf taur par aresas ko aise halaat paidaa karne kaa doshi bataaya jisase baapu kii hatya ho saki
 Patel referred to Veer Savarkar as a conspirator for Gandhiji's assassination
 After the letter he wrote to Nehru, Patel repeatedly referred to Veer Savarkar as a conspirator of Gandhi's assassination and asked Mukherjee and Golwalkar Asked Savarkar to stay away
 lekin swamiji usee party ke sadsy hai, jahaan log aresas se trend hokar aate hai or vir saavarkar kii puja karte hai

 phir thode din baad 18 may ko dubaara milane bulaayaa, ye bolkar ki mujhe ye kutta pasand nahin aayaa, ise waapas le jaao
 The businessman, a resident of Karnal, came and met the Faridabad Metro station at the woman's place of withdrawal

 He said that his brother is coming with a dog in 2-3 hours

 Shortly afterwards, the victim received a call from two different mobile numbers and demanded Rs 40 lakh

 He told the caller that he is not at fault in all these and he cannot pay such a huge amount
 jis par aaropee mahila evam uske do saathiyon ne 17 lakh rupye main sauda tay kar liya
 But the nervous victim lodged a complaint of blackmailing the Central Police Station

 It is alleged that the couple has threatened other artists not to participate in the program
 saath hi unhone dusron ko bhi 'ugaahi' ke racket kaa hissaa ban jane kii salaah di he

 24 feet high Narendra Modi's cut outs, Modi in place at Ramlila Maidan
 
 Modi's slogans of around 40 thousand people and Narendra Modi, equipped with the public figure of three Chief Ministers and four cabinet ministers present on the stage
 satish upaadhyaay se lekar saansad or naa jane kitne bijepi ke netaaon kii nazren narendra modi kii ore lagi maano unka ek ishaara hi in netaaon kii raajnneetik kashti kaa kinaaraa sabit ho jaae
 The absence of posters of other BJP leaders in front of Modi's cutout at Ramlila Maidan indicates that Narendra Modi will be captained by Delhi elections
 dilli bijepi ke netaa is tarah kii 12 raily karwaane kaa iraadaa rakhte hai
 For reporters like us who have seen Sheila Dixit's dominance in the Delhi elections for the last ten years, Narendra Modi's direct interference in the Delhi Assembly elections seems strange
 shaayad unka projection dilli bijepi main madanlaal khurana sareekhe netaaon kii kami kaa nateeja bhi he
 The election game has started in Delhi, on one side there is an army of political workers watching Narendra Modi
 duusari taraf loksabhaa chunaav main karaari shikast kha kar uth khadey hue aam aadmi party ke arvind kejariwal he
 This time along with Kejriwal, Muslim voters also joined the slums
 isi ke chalate unka aatm vishwaas kaaphi badha hua he
 At the same time, Modi remains the choice of the middle class
 ramlila maidan main raily shuru hone se pehle dilli ke bijepi netaaon ko kisi badi ghoshnaa kii ummid thi, lekin kareeb ek ghante chale modi ke bhaashan ke tarkash main mujhe khojane par bhi koi brahmastra nahin mila, jisase vah kejariwal ko post kar sake
 On the other hand, Kejriwal's political status is completely dependent on the Delhi Assembly elections
 iske chalate vah pani se lekar bijli tak free karne kaa vaada kar rahe hai
 Describing the 49-day corruption-free atmosphere as an achievement, he is currently standing strongly in the assembly elections
 haalanki bijepi kii ore se dilli waalon ko die ja rahe is raajnneetik package main teen mukhyamantriyon kii saadagi ke kaside padhe gaye jiske jariye, bijepi ne aam aadmi kii raajnneeti kaa tod nikaalane kii koshish kii he
 But the BJP has also placed a bet on the face of Narendra Modi in Delhi
 daanv bada laga he lihaaja modi ke ranneetikaar raat din mehnat to kar rahe hai, lekin vah aatmavishvaas najar nahin aa rahaa he
 However, elections are to be held after a month and it is to be seen how Narendra Modi makes his political status invincible with such a rally

 Iqbal has been ordered to file a court case against Iqbal Ansari, a party accused in the Babri Masjid case
 yah aadesh adaalat ne nishanebaaj vartika singh kii taraf se daayar arji par diya he
 The court has ordered the police to register an FIR in this case and also present an investigation report in 3 days
 nishanebaaj vartika singh ne yachika daayar karke ikbaal ansaari par deshadroh or anya aaropon main mukadmaa darj karne kaa aadesh dene kii maang kii thi, jise adaalat ne sweekaar kar liya he
 According to the allegations, on September 3, Vartika Singh went to his house to talk to Iqbal Ansari on the Ram temple issue
 is dauraan ikbaal ansaari ne vartika par hathapayee karne kaa aarope lagaaya or unke khilaaf cese darj karaayaa tha, jisaki abhi jaanch chal rahi he
 Accusing the PM of abusing PM, Vartika Singh alleged that Iqbal Ansari had abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath
 vartika singh ne baqayada press conference karke ye aarope lagaae the or unhone yah bhi kaha ki shri ram janmabhumi darshan karne ke baad ek shaks ke kehane par vah ikbaal ansaari se milane pahunchi thim
 But Iqbal Ansari said that the Ram temple will never be built there
 ram mandir or pradhanmantri narendra modi ko lekar ikbaal ansaari ne kaaphi bura bhala kaha
 Based on which the complaint has been made and now an order has been made to file a case
 udhar, ikbaal ansaari ne puure maamle ko farji or managasaint bataaya, or kaha ki vartika singh badale ke tahat yah karrwai kar rahi hai or unke khilaaf jhootha mukadmaa likhaane kii kavayad he
 He never uttered any abusive words about Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath about Ram temple or Babri Masjid
 yah sab sirf unhen fansaane kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 He has spent 15 years in different jails
 pichley bees saal main un par 12 jaanaleva hamale ho chuke hai
 He has had seven surgeries, including two carcinoma surgeries at Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai
 81 varsh kii umr main saiyad ali shah gilaani ne aakhirkaar apana khwab puraa kar liya he- kashmir ghati main bharat virdohi bhaawanaaon kaa netritv karne kaa
 Gehrani, the chairman of tehreek-e-hurriyat and a long-time member of the jamaat-e-islami, does not seem to be in a mood to quietly quit this time
 beshak unke liye yah hairat kii hi baat hogi ki arundhati raay jaisi 'krantikari' bhi kashmir ko bharat se alag karne kii unki maang kaa samarthan karne ko taiyaar hai
 Four months after the strike, in which 111 young men and women were killed, 1,025 arrested and 3,500 injured, Geelani believes they are on the verge of doing a miracle to establish Islamic rule in Kashmir
 beshak yah abhi ek dur kaa khwab najar aata ho, lekin 1953 main jamaat-e-islamic main shaamil hone ke baad se hi yah unke jivan kaa mukhya focus rahaa he
 At that time he used to be a teacher in a government school, and from 1940 to 1944 he spent four years in Lahore and studied Quran and theology
 1944 ke baad ve pakistan nahin laute, haalanki unka 47 varshiya bada betaa naeem pichley das saal se pakistan main hi rah rahaa he
 The funny fact is that a man who wants to break the integrity of India, who hates the idea of a secular India, has nothing to do with financial help from the Delhi and Srinagar governments
 aisi khabaren bhi hai ki unke paas intelegence sikret fund se bhi paisa aata he
 But what cannot be denied is that the government paid for his surgeries, and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed even sent him to a special plane to bring him from Ranchi jail
 is jail main unhen band karke rakhaa gaya tha
 His pacemaker was converted to Escorts Hospital, his gall bladder was removed to Gangaram Hospital, two of his cataract operations were performed at Apollo Hospital
 or to or, unke daanton ko bataraa aspataal main nayaa rang-rup diya gaya
 All this happened in the capital of the country
 tata memorial hospital main hui unki surgery itani safal rahi ki daaen gurde kaa jo hissaa rah gaya tha or vah dobaaraa kaam karne lag gaya he, or donon gurdon kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 His three-storey luxurious and comfortable house in Hyderpura area of srinagar has been provided to him by the jamaat-e-islami
 unhone dilli ke malviya nagar main bhi ek ghar bana rakhaa he jahaan ve kashmir kii sardiyon ke teen maah bitaate hai
 But they remain firm on the demand for independence, which in their eyes will connect Kashmir with Pakistan
 ve aaazaad kashmir nahin chaahate hai, haalanki aazaadee ''bhartiya samrajyavad'' se shreyaskar hogi
 She is a supporter of the ideology that wants Kashmir to be an Islamic state under religious Pakistan
 aazaadee ke samarthak sajaad lone kaa, jo unke ghor aalochakon main se ek hai, maananaa he ki bharat sarkaar gilaani ko aage badhaane ko variyata degi taaki apane mul swaroop main dharmanirpeksh, aazaadee ke andolan ko badnaam kiya ja sake
 "it is an art of governance
" jab tak ve yahaan rahenge, kashmiriyon ke liye aazaadee ek khatarnaak vichaar lagata rahegaa
 Gilani has already launched his campaign for Islamization
 is bare main ve khul kar bol rahe hai ki kis tarah kashmiri yuvaaon ko ''dilli ke public skulon or army skulon ke jariye bhartiyakaran se bachaaya janaa chahie
 Perhaps then DPS Srinagar president Vijay Dhar was asked by the Jamaat people to leave the children for Friday prayers and Siddique Wahid, Vice Chancellor of the Islamic University of Science and Technology, was asked to build a mosque on campus
 
 lekin in donon hi maangon ko sire se khaarij kar diya gaya
 The way youngsters take to the streets in the summer, Gilani is eager to take credit for it
 ve kehete hai ki maut ko lekar in yuvakon main khauf kaa na hona ''anoothaa'' or ''kaabiletarif'' he
 Their source of inspiration? He says, "whenever we talk to youth in rallies, seminars or mosques, i say that the source of inspiration is Quran and Sunnah
 '' nattejey aane lage hai
 He says, "for the awareness that is spreading, we should be grateful to the Jamaat schools started in 1947 and the literature prepared
" ''yahi vah maahaul tha jisane kashmiri pandit or vidwaan shashi shekhar toshkhani ko 1984 main srinagar chhodane par majaboor kar diya
 "gilani is a symbol of the idea of how Islam exerts power over the infidels
" yahi vah vichaar he jisane swatantra bharat kii sabase badi traasadee ko aamantrit kiya, kashmiri panditon ke jatisanhaar ko bhulaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 For many young Kashmiri Muslims, Geelani is like a folk hero, like Libyan Omar Mukhtar who fought against Italy's hegemony in Libya and never compromised
 yah aisi baat he jise mirvij umr faruk bhi maanate hai
 He says, "whenever Kashmir has negotiated with New Delhi, whether it is 1947, 1953 or 1975, its leaders have not always returned relatively, but with less autonomy
" ''unka ishaara parvej musharraf ke chaar-sutri formule ko lekar hue teen charnon kii baatcheet se unhen dilli dwaara baahar kar dene kii ore he
 Gilani was not part of the exercise, although in 2005 he met Musharraf
 musharraf ke samay main pakistan ke rukh badalane ke baavjood gilaani ne aazaadee ke masale par naram padane se inkaar kar diya tha, jisane yuvaaon main unke prabhamandal ko or failaayaa tha
 His approach has always been: declare Jammu and Kashmir a disputed territory, withdraw troops from here, remove all "strict laws", release all political prisoners and make the trip trilateral
 lone kaa sochane kaa tarika kuch or haih ''ve tabhi vaarta chaahate hai jab vah keval unke saath ho, na ki kisi or ke saath
 "lone has reasons to be upset
 gilaani ne lone par us samay andolan ko dhokhaa dene kaa aarope lagaaya tha jab unhone apratyaksh rup se 2002 kaa vidhansabha chunaav ladaa tha or unhen 26 dalon ke majboot sanghathan hurriyat conference se baahar kar diya gaya tha
 But Gilani himself has also contested
 yahaan tak ki unhone 1980 ke sansadeey chunaav main bhi hissaa liya tha, ve baraamula se muslim united front ke ummidavaar the
 He has also been an MLA three times - in 1972, 1977 and 1987

 Today, Geelani says that the world has begun to pay attention to peaceful conflicts in which guns and bombs are not used
 ''brusselles, washington, landan, neuyork or geneva main sammelan ho rahe hai
 Regarding the mutual quarrel between the separatists, they say that this is "past history"
