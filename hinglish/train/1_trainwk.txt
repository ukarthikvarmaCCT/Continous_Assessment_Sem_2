chandrashekhar aaazaad ko mayawati bijepi kaa agent bataati hai
 Congress is no less than the BJP in the misuse of government machinery
 empi ke guna loksabhaa seat par bispi ummidavaar ko congress ne daraa-dhamkaakar jabardasti baitha diya he kintu bispi apane simbal par hi ladakar iskaa jawaab degi va ab congress sarkaar ko samarthan jari rakhane par bhi punarvichaar karegi
 On the other hand, where the BSP is supporting the Kamalanath government in the assembly, but in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress ignored their demand for seats
 yahi haal rajasthan kaa bhi rahaa he
 At the same time, the Congress believes that in this Lok Sabha election, there are as many seats as there are in Uttar Pradesh
 party dalit or savarnon ko apane paale main kar rajya ke vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 If Priyanka becomes a face in it, then there will be no big deal
 kul milakar aisa lag rahaa he ki aane vaale daur main congress or bispi ke bich dalit votaron ko lekar raajnneeti or tej sakati he
 (congress MLA has left the seat vacant for Kamal Nath) In this, the support of BSP, SP and 4 independents is for the Kamal Nath government
 is lihaaj se vaise to kamalnath sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he lekin agar bispi samarthan waapas leti he to uske paas 119 vidhayak rah jaaenge jo bahumat se maatr 3 zyada hai
 The conflict between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP government at the Center has intensified again
 ab tamaluk loksabhaa seat se tiemasi ke navnirvaachit saansad divyendu adhikri ne centre sarkaar ke khilaaf morcha kholaa he
 Divyendu has expressed his displeasure by writing a letter to Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar
 divyendu ke mutabik unhen apane sansadeey kshetra main hone vaale kendriya agenciyon ke kaaryakramon main nahin bulaayaa jaataa jisaki vajah se wo khud ko apamaanit mahasoos kar rahe hai
 In a letter to Parrikar, Divyendu said that the Coast Guard headquarters located in East Midnapore did not think it necessary to show even the minimum courtesy that would have informed them about the event in the district
 bataa den ki pashchim bengal kerajyapal kesharinath treepathine haal main aadhunik radar kaa udghaatan kiya tha
 These radars have been deployed for better connectivity in Haldia and Sagar Islands
 ye kshetra har saal janvari main lagane vaale ganga sagar meley ke liye prasiddh he
 The radar, launched for better coastal defense, was inaugurated by an important program and was attended by many eminent people
 is bich, coast guard ke ek adhikari ne sthaneey saansad ko kaarykram ke liye nyotaa nahin die jane par safai di
 According to this official, Divyendu Adhikari's father-in-law is also an MP from Trinamool Congress and has also been a Union Minister
 unhone kabhi chif guest ke taur par nyotaa die jane ke baavjood kisi kaarykram main hissaa nahin liya
 Nor did he ever react to the invitation
 divyendu adhikari kii ore se raksha mantri ko chitthee likhe jane ke peeche manshaa koi bhi ho, lekin isse nayaa vivaad chhidane kii puri sambhaavna he
 Let me tell you that since the announcement of demonetisation, Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee has taken a strong stand against the central government

 The SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh has suffered another setback
 akhilesh yadav ke elaan ke teen din baad hi nishad party ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan se khud ko alag kar liya he
 Party President Sanjay Nishad said on Friday that we are not with the alliance and the Nishad party will contest the Lok Sabha elections independently
 unhone kaha ki akhilesh yadav ke ravaiye se hamaare kaaryakarta or kor cameti naaraaz he
 Sanjay Nishad said that Akhilesh Yadav had said that he would declare seats for our party
 lekin unhone apane postaron main hamaari party kaa naam or ek shabd tak nahin likhvaya
 Sanjay Nishad said that now we are free and all options are open before us
 nishad party akele bhi lard sakati hai or anya vikalpon par bhi vichaar kar sakati he
 After this, late in the evening, Sanjay Nishad has met Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, it is clear that the Nishad Party can join hands with the NDA soon
 akhilesh ne kiya tha elansapa supremeo akhilesh yadav ne mangalvaar ko hi nishad party, rashtriya samanta dal or janavaadee socialist party ke saath samaajawaadee party ke gathbandhan kaa elaan kiya tha
 All parties will support each other's candidates in the election
 is maukey par akhilesh ne kaha ki gorakhpur loksabhaa upachunaav main bhi hamane aise gathbandhan kiya tha, jis sameekaran ko pradesh ke baba mukhyamantri bhi samaj nahin paae the
 Sanjay Nishad, Nishad Party Chief: Akhilesh Yadav had said he'll make announcement on seats for our party
 But they didn't put our name on poster / letter or anything
 My party workers, authorities, core committee were upset

 Like a good elder brother, Shahid said that he is proud of Ishaan's achievements and is very happy with his career graph so far

 Shivpal Singh Yadav, who is angry at Samajwadi Party, has targeted his nephew former Chief Minister and SP President Akhilesh Yadav
 unhone akhilesh ko salaah dete hue kaha ki agar bujurgon kii baat maani hoti to vah dobaaraa siem banate
 Shivpal said, he fed Akhilesh and his cousin MP Dharmendra Yadav on his lap, brought up, even married him, but the younger generation no longer listens to anyone
 unhone kaha, 'agar bado kii baat maani gai hoti to aaj pradesh main sapa kii sarkaar hoti or akhilesh mukhyamantri hote or bihar main bhi sapa kii sarkaar bani hoti
 Therefore, it is the advice for our lower level officials that all should remain united and also unite people
 'shivpal ne party kaaryakartaaon se apil kii ki ve sapa ke liye ekajute hokar kaam karen
 On the question of justification of the grand alliance efforts by Akhilesh, he said that he does not want to raise any question on the understanding of the national president of the party
 vah party ke hit main sabhi logon ko ekajute rakhana chaahate hai or vah hameshaa se sapa ke liye samarpit hai
 On the question whether he has reached the margins in the SP, the former minister said that if he was marginalized, there would be no public behind him
 vah ab bhi jab kahin jate hai to badi sankhya main log unhen bina bataae pahunch jate hai
 Significantly, before the last assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Shivpal Yadav is not very active in the party after a dispute with Akhilesh Yadav
 is tanaav kaa nateeja yah hua ki party ko upi chunaavon main shikast jhelni padi
 Shivpal Yadav does not even go to the party office after Akhilesh becomes SP president
 haalanki shivpal ne rajyasabha chunaav main party kii ummidavaar jaya bachchan ko vot diya or purv siem akhilesh kii ore se yojit iftaar party main bhi shariq hue
 It is being speculated that Shivpal is going to be given a senior position in the party soon, but the way he has again targeted Akhilesh, it cannot be called positive

 congressi netaa shashi tharur apane 'hindu pakistan' vaale bayaan ko lekar phir se charchaa main hai
 He has said in a special conversation with India Today that if the BJP claims to follow Deen Dayal Upadhyay, it will try to make the country a Hindu Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki aresas or bijepi hindutv kii vichaardhaara ko maanate hai
 BJP leaders consider Savarkar, Gowalwalkar and Deen Dayal Upadhyay as their mentors
 ye log samvidhan ko nahin maanate the
 The Congress leader said that there is a constant danger that they are going to make this country a Hindu Pakistan based on their ideology
 tharur ne kaha ki unhone aresas or bijepi ke netaaon kaa likhaa hua gambhirtha se padhaa he
 He takes his writing seriously
 aresas ne hindu raashtra kaa siddhant diya
 First Savarkar wrote this
 bijepi ne unki tasviir sansad main bhi lagavai he
 Savarkar and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya also carried forward this idea
 tharur ne aage kaha ki pradhanmantri ne to har mantralay ko nirdesh die hai ki deen dayaal upaadhyaay ko lekar kaarykram kiye jaaen
 Deen Dayal Upadhyay rejected the Constitution of India
 vah saavarkar or golwalkar ko follow karte the
 On this basis, Upadhyay rejects the definition of India given by the Constitution and says that India means Hindus and not from any region
 yahaan rahane vaale duusare dharm ke log bahari hai
 These are the views of the present government
 main to keval logon ko yah bataane kaa kaam kar rahaa hum ki in logon ke raashtra ke bare main kya vichaar hai
 He further said that now if the BJP government says that it does not follow the views of these people and they no longer want to make this country a Hindu nation, then they can criticize me
 unhone ab tak in logon ke vichaaron se hatane kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 Therefore, the risk of the country becoming a 'hindu Pakistan' has not decreased
 isse mere jaise udaaravaadi log chintit hote hai or iske liye taiyaar nahin hai, kyonki ham meljol-bhaichaare or samaveshi daur main paley-bade hai
 Back from the statement, 'I will not withdraw', said that if the BJP wins in 2019, our country will become 'hindu Pakistan'
 tharur ne kaha ki unka is bayaan se peeche hatane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he or vah ise baar-baar doharaate rahenge
 Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has also issued a clarification regarding his statement on Twitter and Facebook on Thursday
 tharur ne twitor par kaha he ki kai jagahon par unke bijepi kii jeet se bharat ke 'hindu pakistan' banane ke bayaan ko todaa-maroda gaya he
 Therefore, he is clarifying his statement again
 iske saath hi unhone apane fasebuk post kaa link diya he
 Since some have bizarrely misconstrued my statement on the BJP seeking to turn India into a # hindupakistan, a short explanation of what the term means: https: / / t
 co / 8h5euzk5gy— Shashi Tharoor (@shashitharoor)july 12, 2018fasebuk par unhone likhaa, 'maine yah pehle bhi kaha he or phir se kahuunga
 Pakistan was formed on the basis of the religion of the majority
 isse dharmik alpsankhyakon se bhedbhaav hota he or unhen samaan adhikaar nahin milte
 India never accepted this argument, which also led to the partition of the country
 lekin bijepi / aresas ke hindu raashtra kaa vichaar desh ko pakistan jaisaa banane kaa he
 a country where the religion of minorities is considered subordinate to the religion of the majority
 aisa karne se desh 'hindu pakistan' ban jayega or hamaara swadhinata sangram isliye nahin ladaa gaya tha
 Nor is the idea of such a country compiled in our constitution
 'bijepi boli- rahul maangen maafiapako bataa den ki tharur ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha ki agar saal 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi jiti, to hindustan kaa samvidhan khatre main pad jayega
 India will become 'hindu Pakistan'
 unhone kaha tha ki aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kii jeet se loktantric mulya khatre main pad jaaenge
 The BJP also retaliated on this statement by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor
 bijepi ke rashtriya pravaktaa sambit paatra ne kaha ki tharur ke bayaan par congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko maafee maangani chahie
 However, Congress has supported Tharoor's statement
 tharur ke bayaan par congress ke sanghathan mahasachiv ashok gahalot ne kaha, 'unhone kya kaha or unki manshaa kya thi, vahi bataaenge
 i believe that if you criticize the government, then you are a traitor

 The state government has tried to intervene in this matter from the court, but the result has been cipher

 The Chardham Development Council was formed by the then Narayan Dutt Tiwari government in Uttarakhand in 2005-06 to promote religious tourism
 is parishad ke adheen badri, kedaar, gangotri, yamunotri samet aise mandiron ko bhi laane kii yojana thi, jinamein vaarshik chadhaava ek karod rupye se adhik aata ho
 But this campaign came to a close when the then Tehri King and MP Raja Manvendra Shah started opposing it
 ek baar phir aisa hi vivaad sir uthaa rahaa he
 This time it is about a district level committee at Jageshwar, a prominent Shiva temple in Almora district of Kumaon division
 hua yah ki jageshwar mandir ko lekar nainital hycourt ne ek nirdesh jari kiya ki is mandir kii dekharekh or aay-vyay kaa lekhajokha rakhane ke liye jiladhikari kii adhyakshata main ek cameti banaai jaae

 The State Archaeological Survey Department officer was also made a member, and a selected member was also kept from among the priests
 ab yah cameti vivaadon ke ghere main he
 Mohan Chandra Bhatt, head of Jageshwar Gram Panchayat, says, "this committee is formed in a wrong way
 hycourt kii manshaa ko hi jhuthla diya gaya he
 "they allege that the three members were taken from the same faction of the temple
 ek saamaajik kaaryakarta pankaj bhatta tark dete hai, ''puraatan samay se hi jageshwar mandir ke sanchaalan main teen prakaar ke pujari hote hai- ek praat: pujari, duusare bhoga pujari or tisare pande
 Members were elected from the committee only in the morning
 " mahamrityunjay mandir ke jyeshtha pujari shashti dutt bhatta ke anusaar, mandir ke liye jo samiti gathit hui he, usne pujaariyon kii gananaa hi galat kar di
 He says, "the district administration recorded the number of priests in the temple at 74, while the temple has only 12 priests
" inhen pande ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Bhog priests and morning priests are the temple workers
 " cameti ne mandir main puja kii alag-alag daren tay kar di hai, jiske kaaran shraddhaluon main bhi rosh he
 Now the priest society is preparing to go against it to the High Court

 Failure to do so often leads to repentance
 jab ham yang hote hai to lagata he ki mouj-masti karne ke liye yahi time he
 So we should live our lives
 aisa khaastaur par 20-25 saal kii umr ke bich hota he
 But later it is understandable that if we do not consider the value of money in time, then we are left with a lot of achievements
 yahaan jaanate hai aisi 5 badi galatiyon ke bare main jo20-25 saal kii umr ke dauraan yuva aksar karte hai :1
 Not having the right plan for career Most Indian youth either want to become doctors or engineers
 log apni ruchi or capacity ko dhang se samaj nahin pate hai
 The result is that in coaching you join the race to waste money and your hard work
 isliye jaruri he ki aap sahi samay par sahi kariyar kaa chunaav karke usee main paise or samay kharch karen
 2
 paise ke liye parents par nirbhar rahanaakai log aise hote hai jo khud kamaane ke baavjood apane parents kaa sahaara puri tarah se chhod nahin pate
 It often happens in the first and second jobs that youngsters spend all their salary for living, eating and fulfilling their remaining hobbies before the end of the month and then ask the parents
 aisi naubat na aeiske liye jaruri he mani management siikhnaa
 3
 lagaataar bachat na karnapahali or duusari job ke dauraan yaa phir college life main bhi paise bachaane ke prati hameshaa ek jimmedaari honi chahie
 Many people save one month and not the other month
 aisi laaparvaahee ke chalate unka seaving acount khaali rahata he or jarurat ke samay unke paas kuch nahin hota
 One reason for this is to spend extra money instead of spending in things of need
 4
 It is very important to have practical knowledge of finance and not to understand practical finance and money management
 aapako yah pataa hona chahie ki choti-choti bachat karke hi aage aap ghar or car jaisi chijen kharidne laayak ho pate hai
 For this, you should keep reading some financial blogs etc
 so that you are aware of profitable methods of investment
 5
 Do not think far away, usually youngsters believe in living today and do not want to worry about tomorrow
 lekin yahi gaiyr jimmedaarana andaaj unhen baad main pachhataane par majaboor kar detaa he
 After some time, it is realized that the friends thinking of saving earlier have become property and car owners today and they remain there

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi at the OBC conference in Delhi on Monday cited what coca-cola and mcdonalds companies said that he was being criticized on social media
 pehle rahul ne kaha kya tha, wo bataa dete hai
 On coca-cola, Rahul Gandhi said, "you must have heard the name of the coca-cola company, who is the person who has not heard the name of the coca-cola company here
" coca-cola companni ko kisne shuru kiya
 Who was this koi jaanata he
 Let me tell you coca-cola shuru karne vaala ek shikanji bechney vaala vyakti tha
 He used to sell in America
 pani main chini milaataa tha
 His experience was respected
 hunar kaa aadar hua, paisa mila coca-cola company bani
 After this, Rahul said about the Macdonald company, "you must have heard the name of mcdonald's company, you must have heard it all
 kisne chaalu kiya tha ise
 Can anyone tell me what he used to do wo dhaba chalaata tha
 You show me the dhaba in Hindustan that has formed a coca-cola company, where is it? 'aaie, ham aapako bataate hai ki duniya kii in donon mashhoor companiyon kii shuruyaat kaise hui
 coca-cola: Some such came among us coca-cola is one of the most recognized brand in the world which is sold in more than 200 countries
 coca-cola kii shuruyaat 1886 main america ke atlanta main ek pharmacist dow jon es pembaraton ne kii thi
 Pemberton took part in the war as a military during the American Civil War and was badly wounded in it
 yuddh khatm hone ke baad pembaraton ne dard se raahat ke liye morphine (opium kaa satva) kaa sahaara lenaa shuru kar diya, lekin ek pharmacist hone kii vajah se unhen maaloom tha ki marphin lambey samay tak lenaa khatarnaak ho saktaa he or isse nashe kii lat lag sakati he
 This was the reason that they thought of making drinks that do not contain opium but instead use coca
 pembaraton ne cocain, cola nat or ek or paudhe ko milakar ek drink banaai jise pehle pembaraton kii french wine cola kaa naam diya gaya
 To sell the drink, Pemberton chose a shop near his home in Atlanta called Jacobs Pharmacy
 pembaraton vahaan apane syrup ko jag main lekar jate jise soda se saath milakar bechaa jaataa tha
 People liked this drink very much
 coca-cola naam dene kaa shrey pembaraton ke ekanutent ko jaataa he jinka naam phankr robinsan tha
 He created a special way to write cola-cola, which is written in the same way till today
 lekin duniya ke is sabase mashhoor dinkr kii khoj karne vaale pembaraton iskaa kuch khaas phayda nahin uthaa sake
 Pemberton died in 1888
 lekin isse pehle hi unhone apni company ko dhire-dhire kar bech daalaa tha
 One such businessman named Candler recognized the power of coca-cola and bought all its stake
 candler ne coca-cola ko is mukaam tak pahunchane main sabase badi bhoomika nibhaai
 Today, coca-cola is the most recognized word in the world after 'OK'
 coca-cola kii khapat duniya main kitni hoti he iskaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki agar isaki sari botalon ko ek line main laga diya jaae to ye line chand tak 1,677 baar jaakar laut sakati he
 Macdonald: The story of the beginning Macdonald's story is also very interesting
 isaki shuruyaat 1940 main america ke california main do bhaiyon ne kii thi
 His names were Dick and Mac mcdonald
 makdonald kii shuruyaat karne se pehle mike or dick filmon kaa vyapaar karte the, lekin isamen kuch khaas safalataa na milane ke kaaran unhone filmon kaa kaam chhodkar makdonald naam se hamburger bechney vaala restaurant shuru kiya
 mcdonald's started as a self-service restaurant where people could drive directly and get food quickly
 makdonald kii khaas baat yah thi isamen logon ko maatr 15 saint main hamburger miltaa tha
 The idea of such a cheap hamburger became such a hit in California that the two brothers started franchising it
 kuch hi dinon main makdonald ke nau or restaurants khul gaye
 mcdonald's first restaurant outside of the US started in Canada
 aaj duniyabar ke 100 deshon main makdonald group ke 36,000 restaurant hai
 Macdonald's early menus consisted of hamburger cheese burgers, softdrinks, milk coffee, pie, and potato chips
 potato chips hi baad main french friese ban gaya jo aaj makdonald kaa sabase zyada bikne vaale snacks main se ek he

 The country in which 4
 3 karod log nimonia se peedit ho vahaan is bhayanak beemaari ke prati jaagrukta failaana behad jaruri ho jaataa he
 However, it is difficult to identify it due to the symptoms of common flu, chest infection and cough
 nimonia bacteria, virus or fungus se fefdon main hone vaala ek kism kaa sankraman hota he, jo fefdon main ek taral padaarth jamaa karke khun or oxigen ke bahaav main rukaawat paidaa kar detaa he
 If you are having cough with mucus, severe chest pain, high fever and deep breath then it may be pneumonia

 Children suffering from pneumonia can also die due to dirty environment, malnutrition and lack of breastfeeding
 nimonia kai tareekon se failata he
 Viruses and bacteria are often found in the nose or throat of children and can go into the lungs if they go out of breath
 ve khaansee yaa cheenk kii buundon se hawa nalee ke jariye bhi fail sakate hai
 In addition, pneumonia can also be spread at the time of birth or soon after the blood becomes infected
 vaxin, uchit paushtik aahaar or paryaavaran kii swatchta ke jariye nimonia roka ja saktaa he
 Pneumonia bacteria can be treated with antibiotics but only one third of children get antibiotics
 aise main jaruri he ki sardiyon main bacchon ko garm rakhaa jaae
 Encourage spending some time in exposure to sunlight and allow room to not get damp
 saath hi unhen uchit paushtik aahaar or aavashyak vaxin bhi milanaa jaruri he
 The neumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenzae type b are two major vaccines that protect against pneumonia

 apni kambek ko safal banane ke liye amisha ne koi kor-kasar baaki nahin chodi he
 Amisha, who is making her mark as the hero of the film, has not only played a negative character for the first time but after her superhit film 'gadar' has once again tried to revive her character with lovemaking scenes
 'gadar: ek prem katha' (2001) main jahaan amisha divoted patni thi, vahiin ‘shortkat romeo’ main vah apni shaadishuda jindagi se ub chuki amir aurat bani hai
 To fulfill her work desire on the basis of her money, she takes an external means and gets caught in the clutches of the shortcut Romeo

 After much persuasion, Amisha agreed to do this scene

 aaj ke samay main jis tarah kii filmein ban rahi hai or jis tarah se darshakon kaa sahyog cinema ko mil rahaa he, ham usase zyada kii ummid nahin kar sakate
 Imran said, whether the film was 'matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola' or 'delhi Belly', if such films were made 10-15 years before today, the box office would have fallen flat
 imran ko filmon main aae chaar saal hue hai
 He has proved himself in the cinema world by his acting ability

 We want the audience to like our work in films, remember our roles

 This is not only because time has changed, but today cinema has more viewers
 imran ne kaha, kai saare yuva pratibhashali nirdeshak, nirmaataa or kahani lekhak din pratidin film jagat se jud rahe hai
 We cannot expect much from the kind of films being made in today's time and the way cinema is getting audience support

 mumbai manthan ke 'saas, bahu se digital tak' seshan main actress richaa chaddha, produsar gul khan, actor nakul mehta or sumit vyas ne shirkat kii
 Everyone talked about the craze of the growing web series in India
 richaa web siries 'insaide aij' main dikhaai de rahi hai
 He said that the model of films is no longer working
 agar aaj 3 karod main film bane to 5 karod relies par lagane honge
 Many films get stuck upon release
 agar main musuri main rahati hum to 'masaan' jaisifilm dekhne ke liye dehardoon janaa hoga
 Distribution is messed up
 isliye choti bajet kii filmein pit jaati hai
 National anthem in theater, demonetisation correct: Regarding the pressure of Sonu Nigam's 10 big Bolweb series in Manthan 17, he said that there is a lot of pressure
 'insaide aij' main mehnat zyada thi or isiilie paise maine film vaale hi liye the
 People keep watching web series slowly at their pace
 hamaare parents ke samay tivi par 'nukkad', 'buniyaad' jaise achche shoj aate the
 Now TV viewers also changed
 'buniyaad' vaale darshak shaayad nae serials se kam rilate kar pate hai
 People who watch Hollywood TV shows do not like our show that much
 digital future nahin, pregent he
 He said that i have seen nonsense things on digital as well
 log jabardastee gaali dete hai
 This is the misuse of freedom
 thode din main isamen bhi sensorship aa jaaegi
 Sonu Nigam said- i will respect the national anthem of PAK, not communal, although people watch TV shows on digital as well
 content donon jagah par dekha ja rahaa he
 Richa believes that cinema is threatened by digital
 choti filmein dekhne zyada audiyans nahin aate
 Producer Gul Khan has produced the 'tanahiyan' web series
 wo kareeb 15 saal se tivi par sakriy he
 He has done shows like 'ishqbaaz', 'kabul Hai'
 kaarykram ke dauraan unhone kaha- web siries hamaare personal chwis par nirbhar nahin he
 This is the demand of the world
 isamen distribution kii samasya nahin he
 People used to think that TV is a small medium
 log filmein karnaa chaahate the, lekin ab samay badal gaya he
 In the web series, you can make a show that only watch the house boy
 ek sho aisa ban saktaa he jo sirf saas dekhe
 Shoots on TV last very long
 web siries kii shooting bahut jaldi khatm ho jaati he
 We made 'tanhaiyan' for Hot Star
 tivi or digital kii audiyans ek jaisi he
 Gul believes that we make fun of TV as much as we do, but it will not end
 89 pratishat web ke audiyans tivi bhi dekhte hai
 He further said- Nagin, the witch's show does not know how
 serial main dikhaaya jaataa he ladki subah uthati he, puja karti he, sabaki samasyaayein sulajhaati hai, lekin main apane shoj main ladakiyon ko aise nahin dikhaanaa chaahati thi
 However the supernatural element is also in Hollywood
 log nai chijen apnaanaa nahin chaahate
 It's easy to make fun of TV
 'ishkbaaj' sho main najar aane vaale nakul mehta ne 'aai dont watch tivi' naam kii web siries bhi banaai thi
 He said- i was thinking of making my own content for a long time
 ham actors lekhakon par nirbhar rahete hai
 The world of TV is very unstructured
 teen saal pehle jab main web siries kaa idia lekar logon ke paas gaya to logon ne kaha phone main bana lo
 Ronnie Screwvala liked my idea
 content par nirbhar karata he ki log kya dekhnaa pasand karenge
 He said that the actors of the web series are also very popular
 sumit vyas (permanent rumments fame) bahut femes hai
 Popularity in TV is easy, but the actors of web series are also popular
 ham chaahate hai ki ham jo bhi kaam kare use darshak dekhen
 Manthan 2017: Parineeti Boli - Golmaal The biggest film of my career, the entire team who came to Dhamaal, Sumesh Vyas of 'permanent Roommates', also expressed their opinion on the web series
 unhone kaha- 2017 main 'permanent rummets' kii thi
 There was a lot of change after that
 agar main internet par kuch karnaa chahta tha to producers ko lagata tha ki ye hamaari hobbi he, ham syrius nahin he
 But we used to work serially
 hamaare paas us samay paisa nahin tha
 At that time, there used to be shows on TV which showed what would have happened 50 years ago
 filmon main bhi ajeeb chijen (gaadiyaan udaana) dikhaaya ja rahaa tha
 Everyday life was not shown
 jab unase poocha gaya ki kya tivi or filmon main log paise or fame ke liye hi aate hai
 On this, he said- i do not think everybody comes for earning money and fame only
 kuch log kahani bataane bhi aate hai
 They get a chance to tell their own story
 unhone bataaya ki web siries kii kamai brands se hoti he
 Brands are featured in the story
 'tripsling' main 'tata tiego' dikhaaya gaya tha
 If the brand becomes part of the story then it does not look that bad
 web siries main sensorship par unhone kaha- audiyans samajhadaar he
 They know what to look for
 web madhyam main aapako jabardastee cheez nahin dikhaai ja rahi he
 You open the mobile or laptop and watch the web series
 War Box Office Collection Day 23: ruthik roshan (hrithik Roshan) or tiger shroff (tiger Shroff) kii film 'war (war)' kaa dhamaakedaar pradarshan cinemagharon main abhi bhi jari he
 In the fourth week too, the pace of the film is quite impressive
 shuruaati dinon se hi box offis par dhuaan udaane vaali 'war' ne 'sultan' or 'padmavat' jaisi jabardast filmon ko bhi peeche chhod diya he

 Apart from earning, the film has also managed to win the hearts of the audience through its content and actors
 khaskar ruthik or tiger kii jodi ko parde par dekhne ke liye phens main kaaphi craij dekhne ko mila
 Let me tell you that the story of the movie 'war' is from 'kabir' Hrithik Roshan and 'khalid' Tiger Shroff
 film main halaat kuch aise banate hai ki guru or shishy ek duusare se takaraane ko majaboor ho jate hai
 The disciple Khalid is used to tighten the uncontrollable guru, and then begins a tremendous action
 bike, car, helicopter, barf pahaad har jagah ection dekhne ko miltaa he
 Many tremendous twists have also been inserted in the story and the ending of the film has also been kept a bit surprising
 in sabase itar darshakon ko 'war' (war) main bharpoor maatra main acshan or stants dekhne ko milegaa

 ) Amid tensions in India and Pakistan after the special status of Jammu and Kashmir was abolished, UN Human Rights Chief Michel Bachelet on Monday asked the two countries to ensure that the human rights of the people of Kashmir are respected and protected
 sanyukt raashtra maanavadhikaar kii ucchayukta bachalet ne yah bhi sunishchit karne ko kaha ki assam main rashtriya naagarik panji (enarasi) satyaapan logon ko raashtra viheen nahin kare
 He said on Kashmir that his office is getting reports on the human rights situation on both sides of the Line of Control
 unhone maanavadhikaar parishad ke 42wein satr ke udghaatan bhaashan main kaha, 'main bharat sarkaar ke haal ke kadamon se kashmiriyon ke maanavadhikaar par pade prabhaav ko lekar atyant chintit hum jisamen internet sanchaar or shantipurna sabha par pabandi or sthaneey netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ko hiraasat main liya janaa shaamil he
 Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after India decided to abolish most of the provisions of Article 370 to abolish special status of Jammu and Kashmir and divide the state into two union territories
 pakistan ne is par kadi pratikriya jataai thi
 Bachelet said, 'I urge the governments of India and Pakistan to respect and protect human rights
 maine vishesh taur par bharat se aagrah kiya he ki vartmaan pabandi yaa karfu main dheel de jisase buniyadi sevaaon tak logon kii pahunch sunishchit ho or yah ki hiraasat main liye gaye logon ke uchit prakriya vaale sabhi adhikaron kaa sammaan ho
 Bachelet said that it is important that the people of Kashmir be consulted and involved in any decision making process that has an impact on their future
 bharat ne kaha he ki anuchhed 370 ke adhiktar praavdhaanon ko samaapt karnaa uskaa aantarik maamla he
 India has also strongly criticized Pakistan for making 'irresponsible rhetoric' and provocative statements on anti-india and its internal issues
 bachalet ne yah bhi kaha ki assam main haal hi main rashtriya naagarik panji ke satyaapan prakriya se kaaphi anischitata or chintaa utpann hui he, jiske tahat kareeb 19 lakh logon ko 31 agast ko prakashit antim suchi se baahar kar diya gaya he
 He requested the Government of India to follow the proper rules during the appeals process, not to send people back or to be detained and to ensure that people do not become a nation
 bharat kaa kahana he ki enarasi ko apadet karnaa bharat ke supreme court ke aadesh par chalaai ja rahi ek vaidhanik, paardarshee, vidhik prakriya he
 The Indian government has also said that being out of NRC will not affect the rights of any person resident in Assam
 videsh mantralay ne pichley saptaah jari ek bayaan main kaha, 'jinka naam antim suchi main nahin he, unhen hiraasat main nahin liya jayega or unhen ab tak mil rahe ve sabhi adhikaar milte rahenge jab tak kanoon ke tahat unhen mili sabhi vikalp khatm nahin ho jate
 It does not make a person out of NRC devoid of nation

" aise main sudhaaron teji se lagu karne kii jarurat he
 North Korea, already isolated from the entire world by dictator Kim Jong Un's antics, is now becoming more entrenched
 wo china kii dosti se bhi haath dho saktaa he
 In this world, China is one of the few countries that has a good relationship with North Korea
 lekin ab north korea ke parmaanu pareekshanon or america se chalati tanatani kii vajah se china ne north korea main kim jong un kii hukumat badalane par soch-vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya he
 For the first time, an open debate has started in China on this issue, which was a legal ban till now
 yani north korea kaa taanashaah thodaa or ghir chukaa he
 Kim wants to destroy Korea's dictator Jong Undunia for the mistake of taking it lightly
 khaskar america raashtrapati donald trump ko
 Who are making the mistake of taking it lightly again and again
 wo kabhi use rocket main kehete hai
 Ever mad man
 to kabhi sanakee main
 Even knowing that he is unaware that he has 5-5 nuclear and hydrogen bombs
 agar vahi sanakee pagal, divaana ho gaya to phir aisi tabaahi laaegaa ki uskaa khamiyaaza puri duniya ko bhugatna padegaa
 The hostility between North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump is now well known, instead of China, there is a new screw in this story that the Chinese mood has become too harsh on Kim Jong Un's antics
 ji haa, wo china, akele jise puri duniya main north korea kaa nazadiiki mulk mana jaataa he, ab usne kim jong un kii hukumat ko lekar sochna shuru kar diya he
 There has been a new and open debate in China about whether Kim Jong Un's rule should end from North Korea? No one could think of such a debate in China, from Kim to angry Dragoncle, but now it seems In view of the frequent nuclear tests in North Korea, China's position has also started changing
 ye or baat he ki ab bhi china kaa oficial agenda north korea or america ko baatcheet ke liye taiyaar karnaa hi he, taaki duniya main aman rahe
 But it seems that China has started to move due to Kim's attitude
 china main bahabab north korea chaaron taraf se ghirne laga he
 China has also turned its eyes on Kim's actions
 north korea kii hukumat badalane par china main bahes shuru ho gai he
 So will China stand against Kim? This question is important
 haalanki ye bhi sach he ki haal hi melmericane north korea ko buree tarah lalakaara he
 Trump has threatened to ruin Kim by calling her crazy, cynical and unaware
 aise kisi aam aadmi ko bhi lalakaara jaae to use bhi gussa aa jaae
 Trump told Kim Madman: First of all, know what the hell is about
 duniya par is tabaahi kii naubat kyon ai
 So for this first listen to the speech of US President Donald Trump
 unhone kaha 'meadman ko aisa sabak sikhayenge, jindagi bhar yaad rakhega
 Kim is a lunatic who does not care about her people
 itani goli maarenge ki duniya dekhati rah jaaegi
 a fierce battle with Kim can happen anytime
 'america dilaa rahaa he taishakisi aam aadmi ko bhi is tarah lalakaara jaae to use bhi jalaal aa jaae
 This is still Kim Jong Un
 apane aage kisi kii sunanaa ise bardaasht nahin
 Still knowing everything, the US President is telling jokes to get him a swim
 lihaaza usne bhi apane hydrogen bam se prashanth mahaasaagar main aisi tabaahi machaane kii dhamkee di he ki uski jad main puri duniya aa jaaegi
 Will attack with hydrogen bomb, who do not know about the strength of hydrogen bomb
 wo phir se sun len ki ye itnaa shaktishaalee bam hota he ki tsunami ke alawa samandar se lekar zamin tak jaljla laa degaa or zamin apni jagah se khisakane lagengi
 Marshal Kim Jong-un of the North Korea, falling into the Pacific Ocean, will blow your senses knowing what a shocking hydrogen bomb it is
 ye jaananaa zaruri he ki is adaavat or is dhamkee ko lekar kitna sanjeeda he kim jong un
 Kim advised Trump that in a statement issued by the Korean Central News Agency, Kim Jong Un said, "A scared dog barks louder
" main trump ko salaah dena chaahunga ki jab wo duniya ke saamne koi baat kahen, to apane shabdon ke chayan par dhyaan den
 The American president's threat to let a whole nation ruin is a proof of his mental bankruptcy
 raashtrapati kii kursi par baithne ke baad se hi trump ne apni blakemeling or dhamkee bhari baton se puri duniya ko baichaiyn kar rakhaa he
 He is not capable of becoming the Supreme Commander of any country's army
 asal main wo koi siyasatdan nahin, balki ek aisa gangster he, jise aag se khilne kaa shauk he
 The loss of the world in both the quarrels is just an expression of the anger that despite having all the strength, this marshal of North Korea is sitting in his heart
 iske bayaan se to aap andaaza laga hi chuke honge ki trump kii ek ek dhamkee iske dil main kitne andar tak ghar chuki he
 To avenge every alpha that has grown against him, US President Donald Trump has asked for him
 lihaaza ganimat yahi he ki ek kadam wo peeche hate or ek kadam ye peeche aae
 Because if these two continue to fire like this against each other, then the whole world will surely get scorched in its heat
 kim kaa saath chhod saktaa he chinalekin lagata he ki china bhi ab north korea kaa saath chhod saktaa he
 Until now, there was a legal ban on any debate in China about changing the regime in North Korea
 lekin shaayad china ab north korea par dabaav bananaa chahta he
 And then it has also supported new and tough sanctions imposed on North Korea by the United Nations
 congress ke varisht netaa manishankar ayyar ke bayaan par ek baar phir vivaad punap gaya he
 This time there has been a ruckus on his remarks about Lord Rama
 bhartiya janata party ne ayyar ke ram janmabhumi se jude bayaan par tanj kasate hue poocha he ki vah khud bataaen ki kahaan paidaa hue the?ram ke janm sthaan par sawaal uthaane par bijepi ne mangalvaar ko manishankar ayyar se poocha he ki vah khud bataaen ki kahaan paidaa hue the? bijepi ke pravaktaa shalab mani treepathi ne twit kar ayyar se poocha ki 'prabhu ram ke liye ochhi bhashaa bolne vaale manishankar pehle yah bataaen ki vah kis kamare main paidaa hue
 He told in a conversation with the news agency 'bhasha' that Iyer's statement has hurt the faith of the Hindus of the country, the whole country knows that the Congress party has always been making fun of Prabhu Ram's existence
 vah ramsetu ko nakaarti he, uske netaa kapil sibbal adaalat main ram mandir masale ko latakaane kii koshish main lage hue hai, isi tarah se ab manishankar ayyar kaa bayaan aayaa he
 He said the statement of Kimanishankar is directly an open mockery of Hindu faith
 isaki jitani bhi ninda kii jaae kam he
 It is worth noting that Iyer had said in a program on Monday that 'what does it mean to build temples there?' Dasaratha was a very great Maharaja
 kaha jaataa he ki unke mahal main das hajaar kamare the
 Who knows which room was where? Therefore to say that we think that Lord Rama was born here, that is why a temple is to be built here, because there is a mosque here
 pehle ham masjid todenge or isaki jagah ham mandir banaaenge
 this is wrong

 inakam tex ritern daakhil karne waalon par apane pan number ko aadhaar se jodne ke liye dabaav badhata ja rahaa he
 June 30 is the last day to link Aadhaar and PAN on Friday
 agar aapane pehle hi link kar liya he to thik he, nahin to is process ke jariye aap link kar sakate hai
 How to link PAN and Aadhaar? - First of all keep the PAN and Aadhaar number
 - iske baad inakam tex kii website par jaaen
 There you will get the link Aadhaar option

 There will be a captcha code that you have to fill and your process will be completed as soon as you submit
 - agar aapkaa aadhaar pehle se hi pan se link he to is baat kaa bhi massej aa jayega
 Why linking Aadhaar PAN is necessary? From July 1, it will be mandatory to give a 12-digit Aadhaar number to file income tax returns and obtain a new PAN number
 aadhaar ke jariye milane vaali biometric suvidha se tex vibhaag ko tex farjivada pakadaney main aasaani hogi
 At the same time, the problem of tax evasion and more than one PAN number can also be curbed
 gauratlab he ki aadhaar kisi kii pahchaan sthapit karne ke liye pan se adhik vyapak he
 Therefore, after combining these two, the ability of the tax department to collect data and understand it will increase
 gauratlab he ki is linking ke baad desh main aam aadmi dwaara kharch kiye ja rahe paise kaa puraa aankada tex vibhaag ke paas pahonchega jisase vah tex sambandhi nae niyam kanoon bana sakegaa
 Its big advantage will be in increasing the tax base in the country

 1 in 87 crore people
 62 karod logon ne tex ritern daakhil to kiya lekin tex main ek bhi rupee kaa bhugtan nahin kiya
 This is because a large number of people steal tax or avoid paying tax
 lihaaja, desh mentax collectionko badhaane ke liye inakam tex vibhaag ne ritern daakhil karne ke liye aadhaar se linking ko anivaary kar diya he
 After this linking it will be easier to stop tax evasion
 kar chuke AADHAR-PAN linking, ab milegaa phaaydadesh main 112 karod logon kaa aadhaar card ban chukaa he
 In this, more than 40 crore people have also linked Aadhaar to their bank account
 aadhaar nabanr se kisi kii pahchaan sthapit karne kaa system bhi taiyaar kiya ja chukaa he
 Now, the central government's exercise is to benefit all government schemes under direct benefit transfer to these 112 crore people by using this Aadhar card
 lihaaja desh kii 125 karod jansankhya main abhi bhi 13 karod se adhik aise log hai jinka aadhaar card nahin bana he or sarkari skiimon kaa phayda lene ke liye unhen 30 june tak apana aadhaar banavaa lenaa hoga

 Everyday millions of people traveling by metro and bus cross the road in the capital Delhi

 or ye kuch aise kadam rahe hai jisase paidal chalane waalon ko kaaphi raahat mili

 deshbhar main ek samaan tex pranali (jiesti-guds and services tex) kii shuruyaat bhartiya aarthik itihaas main sabase ahm faisla he
 The central government is trying to get the necessary legislation passed in the current parliament session due to the exercise to implement GST across the country from July 1
 iske liye desh ke sabhi rajyon or kendra main vyapak sahmati, transperency ke saath faisla karne kii vyavastha or nai kar pranali se rajyon ko hone vaale nuksaan kii kendra sarkaar dwaara bharpai karne kii guarantee ke baad yah faisla vaaki tex vyavastha ke liye abtak kaa sabase bada aarthik faisla hoga
 But there are still many issues to pass it on which no consensus has been announced yet
 in muddon par sahmati isliye bhi ahm he kyonki iske baad hi ek majboot jiesti desh main jagah legaa
 1
 jiesti kii standard dar 18 fisadi rakhane ke liye rajnatik sahmati banani hogikendra sarkaar yadi jiesti kaa sabase bade phayda kanjumar ko pahunchaana chaahati hai to iske liye jaruri he ki jiesti kii standard dar 18 fisadi rakhane par aam sahmati jald se jald bane
 Currently, the state VAT standard rate is 14
 5 fisadi he or sarvice tex kii dar 15 fisadi he vahiin central exise kii dar 12 fisadi ke aasapaas he
 Now, if the GST rate is 18 percent instead of the 20 or 24 percent proposal, then it will be considered as the biggest success of GST and the biggest benefit to the consumer will be not to increase inflation
 2
 Electricity, petrochemical products and stamp duty are outside the GST - the important GST framework for ease of business, the power, petroleum products and stamp duty have been left in the territories of the states excluding GST
 lekin kisi bhi tarah kii aarthik gatividhi ke liye land or power sabase bada kharch hota he
 Therefore, due to the loss from GST, the states will have to impose more tax on these things to compensate for the effort
 aise main desh main kaarobaar kii na to laagat kam kii ja sakegi or na hi keemton ko kaabo kiya ja sakegaa
 Therefore, it is important for a strong GST that it should be agreed to bring these things under the purview of GST for Ease of Doing Business in the country
 3
 There is no tax terrorism, according to the existing GST bill, both central and state will do the tax assessment on taxpayers after implementation
 kar daataaon ko ek darjan se adhik panjikaran karaane honge or tex chori athwa kam tex adaa karne par sajaa kaa praavdhaan bhi kiya gaya he
 If this aspect of GST is not improved, then there is a danger of increasing the fear of tax after the implementation
 4
 States should not just compensate, the new way of earning According to the existing GST provision, after the implementation of GST, those states where industrial activity is high
 vahiin jin rajyon main factory or industry kam athwa nahin he ko nuksaan kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 However, in the GST bill, such states will be compensated for some time by the loss in the tax collection
 lekin jab yah muaavja milanaa band hoga to aarthik rup se kamjor rajyon ke saamne rajasav badhaane kii badi chunauti hogi
 Therefore, the Central Government will have to do the exercise to increase economic activity in weaker states from now on
 Otherwise, after the implementation of GST, such states are also backward
 5
 The Panchayat and Municipal bodies at risk are funded by the Panchayati Raj and Municipal institutions in the state from the treasury of the state government
 rajyon kii shaktiyon ko hi vibhajit kar desh main local self gavarnence kaa model taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Now after the implementation of GST, there will be a huge cut in the revenue of the states, due to which the Panchayati Raj and Municipal institutions in the country will face a cut in the funds from the state
 kendra sarkaar ko chahie ki is maamle main bhi vah rajyon ke saath sahmati kare ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad rajya sarkaar ek nishchit bajet in sansthaaon ke liye jari karenge
