 unke mutabik pichley saal se yah sab ho rahaa he
 White colored fluid is coming out of the Neem tree which is intoxicating like a drink
 ek shaks ne neem ke ped par chadhakar apni bottle main nimbirbharkar sabhi ko pilaataa he

 pichley do dinon se achaanak kuch netaaon ne sargical oparation ko lekar sawaal uthaane shuru kar die hai
 Pakistan also got a chance with this
 isi ke baad ye aawaaj uthne lagi ki sarkaar sargical oparation ke saboot ke taur par video duniya ko dikhaa de
 But will it be right? Should the government generalize the evidence of surgical operation? Will this not make the PAK army difficult? Will it not be seen in any such surgical operation beyond this? Some of our leaders have spoken in India, but heard Pakistan
 sawaal hindustan main uchhaale ja rahe hai or jawaab pakistan de rahaa he
 Pakistani TV and newspapers are full of headlines and headlines for our own dancers
 sulagta sawaal yahi he ki kya pichley hafte bharat ne elosi yani line of control ke us paar ghus kar dushman ke kheme mensargical strikkia tha? pakistan pehle din se hi ise jhootha qaraar de rahaa he
 But now the question has become even more heated after some of our own leaders questioned the surgical operation
 yahaan tak ki is vivaad ke baad khudbhartiya senaco ye kahana padaa ki sarkaar chaahe to sargical oparation ke saboot yani video jari kar aise logon kaa munh band kar sakati he
 But at the same time, the army also said that the decision to release or not to release the evidence is entirely with the government
 ab aise main sawaal yahi he ki kya chautarafa raajnneetik dabaav ke aage jhuk kar sarkaar ko sargical oparation ke video jari karne chahie? kya aisa karnaa thik hoga? kya ye aage chal kar sena ke liye khatarnaak nahin hoga?sutron ke mutabik sargical oparation se jude video jari karne kaa faisla sarkaar par chhodane ke sena ke bayaan ke baad nai dilli main is bare main ek hai level meeting hui
 At that meeting, some ministers were in favor of generalizing the evidence, while others including the NSA opposed it
 aakhir main ye faisla pradhanmantri narendra modi par chhod diya gaya
 According to sources, Narendra Modi agreed with the decision of the National Security Advisor that the video should not be released only under political pressure
 sutron kii maane to enese ne sargical oparation se jude video jari karne ke saat bade khatre bataae the
 Those threats are: 1
 oparation ke dauraan istemaal kiye gaye hathiyaaron kii dushman ko jaankaree mil jaaegi
 2
 oparation ke tareeke dushman bhaanp jaaenge
 3
 paak sena ko entry or eczit kaa tarika pataa chal jayega
 4
 oparation kaa pattern aam hote hi agle kisi sargical strike kii taiyaari main dushwari hogi
 5
 paak sena par badla lene kaa dabaav bad jayega
 6
 elosi paar karne or sijafire ke ulanghan ke maamle main ek tarah se ye bhartiya sena kaa kaboolnamaa hoga
 7
 dabaav main saboot jari karne se bhavishya main sarkaar ke liye ye galat parampara ban jaaegi
 According to sources, the army has handed over the visual of the operation for about one and a half hours to the government

 haalanki isse pehle kabhi aise oparation ko saarvajanik nahin kiya gaya

 asp bhootpurv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii hatya kii doshi nalini kii beti harithra shriharan ne congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi se apni maa nalini ko maaf karne kii guzarish kii he
 In a special conversation with NDTV, Nalini's daughter said that she can understand Rahul Gandhi's pain, but her parents have already suffered a lot of punishment and now she deserves forgiveness
 unhone kaha ki apane maa−baap ke jivit rahete hue bhi unhone vahi dard jhela he, jo rahul gandhi ne apane pita kii maut ke baad jhela he
 Significantly, Rahul Gandhi has questioned the decision of the Tamil Nadu government in which the Jayalalitha government has decided to release the killers of Rajiv Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki jab desh ke pradhanmantri ko nyaay nahin mil saktaa he to aam logon kaa kya hoga
 Nalini's daughter praised Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and Congress President Sonia Gandhi, saying that she could never forget Sonia Gandhi
 patliputra kii samrajnisharad pagarevani prakaashan,nai dilli-2,keemtah 695 ru
 Reverse Engineering: Pagareshad Pagare has earlier made a mark in this genre by writing historical novels such as Gulara Begum, Gandharvasen, and Begum Jainabadi
 par yah naveenatam vrihad upanyaas patliputra kii samraji is myne main bhinn he ki iske madhyam se lekhak ne ateet ke un tathyon, paatro or ghatnaon ko mukhar kiya he jinke bare main itihaas maun he
 Writing about the role of his creation process, Pagare says, "historical novels are the coherence of historical truths — facts and realities of literary imagination — divided into boundaries and possibilities
 itihaas main uplabdh saamagree uski simaaen hai
 You can't molest them
 vaisaa karnaa itihaas ke saath anyaay hoga
 Therefore, the balanced coordination of history and literature is the first and last condition of the historical novel
 
 
 ''yah upanyaas brahman putree ashok kii maa samraji dharma par kendrit he jo patliputra ke samraat bindusaar kii solah patraniyon main se ek thi
 But on the pretext, the creation of many such islands of diverse themes, controversies and other characters have come to the fore, which, despite being part of that period of the past, make timely political, social and human discrepancies come true
 shabdaawalee or vaataavaran kaa vivaran kuch aisa prabhaavshaalee he ki lekhak kii adhyayanshiltaa or tikshn drushti kaa pramaan anayas hi sthapit ho jaataa he
 But this goes against the author's assertion that the composition is focused on the Empress Dharmas, as contemporary contemporary themes such as female exploitation, empowerment, corruption, Tiriya Charitra, Dalit discourse, capital, diplomacy and systemic exploitation also make a rapid presence
 Seems to be doing
 saath hi chandragupta, mahamatya chanakya, ashok, chitralekha, mahamatya khallatak, jainacharya bhadraba', bindusaar, rishipravar pingalvatsa, dalit hiranyak, subandhu, ganika kusumita jaise kai paatr hai, jinka charitra vishad rup se is kriti main prakat hua he or dharma ke tulya bhi he
 Yet the writer has his own fascination for Dharma
 isaki prishthbhumi main lekhak ne bhoomika main jo kaaran bataae hai ve swayan apane aap main rochak katha ras se purna hai
 Pagare writes, "we believe a lot in the Indian horoscope
 itihaas main alpagyaat dharma ke bare main or zyada jaanane ke liye maine uski kundali banavaai
 
 
 "this kind of 'reverse engineering' experiment is undoubtedly new in novel mode
" ek or nijee ghatana vivaran de lekhak ne kadachit chaunkaane kii had tak upkram kiya he-''patliputra kii samraji'' ko antim rup se gadhane ke purv teen baar 80 prishth likhakar radd kiye
 
 
 i will not be able to write
 
 Stopped writing tabhi chamatkaar hua
 One evening came to meet a very beautiful look and said, why don't you write the story of Dharma? When the author expressed his compulsion, he said, 'when you can write a rewarding novel on the lesser known historical characters Gulara Begum and Begum Jainabadi even after the lack of authentic material, why not Dharma? 
 
 dharma kii vakaalat karne vaali aap koun? swayan dharma
 
 
 Vati, the unfortunate Dharma, with whom historians did not do justice
 
 
 haa hamaare bete ashok ko jarur mahaan bana diya
 
 
 Write our remembrance of our adorable Devadhidev Mahadev, the novel will be complete
 ''lekhak jab apni rachana prakriya main gambhirtha se paith jaataa he to aise kaalpanik anubhavon kii pramanikta par andeh karnaa yaa na karnaa koi myne nahin rakhata, alabatta daawa rochak or swaabhaavik hi lagata he
 The personal inspiration of the author is also notable that he is from the city of Nimar in Mahwa, Mahishmati (maheshwar), an ancient city, near Ujjain
 samraat hone ke purv ashok ujjayini ke up-raja rahe the
 Ujjain is an ancient city more than three thousand years old
 mathrubhumi kaa rin chukaane ke liye lekhak ne sangitacharya vishakhdutt phalguni or vaishnavi jaise charitron kii kalpana karke tathakthith deshkal ko romaanchak vistaar diya he
 Overall, whatever the writer's own personal or academic inspiration, the achievement of Pataliputra as the empress of Pataliputra cannot ultimately be denied in Hindi literature, a huge other historical historical work

 Sonia, who has been in charge of the Congress since 1998, started the trend of organizing such a conference of party chief ministers while the Congress was in opposition at the center
 congress ke baithak kaa istemaal rajyon se jude muddon ko lekar modi sarkaar par hamalaa tej karne ke liye karne kii sambhaavna he
 The comments congress adhyaksh pehle hi centre or pradhanmantri par sansad main 'hathpurna ghamand' kaa aarope lagaate hue hamalaa kar chuki hai
 Some time ago he marched towards Rashtrapati Bhavan with 14 opposition leaders opposing the disputed Land Acquisition Bill

 pakistan kii sena ne buudhvaar ko bharat ke us daawey ko khaarij kar diya, jisamen usne kaha tha ki paak sainikon ne bharat ke ek gashti dal par hamalaa kar do sainikon kii hatya kar di
 The comments usne daawa kiya ki usne jamini pushti kii he or paaya he ki is tarah kaa kuch bhi nahin hua tha
 The Pakistani side said this during a telephone conversation between the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) on both sides

 tamilnadu main coimbatore ke sameep ke pollachi kasbe ke ek nijee chatravaas main rah raheen do naaballig ladakiyon ko do logon ne agava kar kathith rup se unke saath gangrape kiya
 Police said that the incident occurred after midnight when the accused came to the hostel and asked for water

 He said that when a boy, an eyewitness of the incident, objected to this, the accused beat him up
 baad main ve ladakiyon ko sameep ke ek parisar main jabardastee le gaye or unke saath balaatkaar kiya

 baad main police ko iske bare main bataaya gaya
 On reaching the spot, the police found that the girls were badly injured and their bodies were bleeding

 Suddenly a wave has arisen, called Rahul Gandhi
 congress kaa itihaas likhane vaale yah darj karenge ki 2009 kii beraham garmiyon ke dauraan gandhi parivaar kaa yah uttaradhikari antat apni maa kii surakshit chaaya se baahar nikal aayaa, apane vichaaron ko abhivyakt karne laga-or party ke bhi
 For the last five years, it was the story of a hesitating crown prince who was stuck between the demands of dynasty and the challenges of politics
 brands rahul ko kai baar nafasat se pesh kiya gaya, shuruyaat do saal pehle unhen party kaa mahasachiv bana kar hui
 Or when he emerged as the party's star campaigner in the last round of the last assembly elections, or when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh offered him a ministerial position in the cabinet and he politely turned it down
 har baar yuva gandhi apni anubhavheenata kii baat kah kar maukey kaa phayda nahin uthaa paae
 He used to argue that I-am-trainee-am-my-time-has-not-arrived
 aise daur main, jab saarvajanik jivan kaa kul chaar saal kaa anubhav rakhane vaala or haal hi main seenetter bana shaks america kaa raashtrapati ban saktaa he, anubhavheenata kaa tark aatmasanshay ko ujagar karata he
 But these were all things of yesterday, today they are showing the aggression of an attacker, the seriousness of the policy maker and the domination of a leader who knows very well what his position is in the minds of the party and desperate Congressmen
 kurte kii baanhen mode, badi adheeratha se ve apane chashme ko maathe par chadhaate hai or aisa kaarykram lekar gaanvon kii ore chal padate hai, jo mahaj ek mahasachiv ke kaarykram se kahin adhik kuch he
 Whether it is an open-minded poor man from a remote village or the media in the conference hall, the 38-year-old MP from Amethi has become the most heard voice in India's oldest party
 to kya ham kah sakate hai ki rahul gandhi kaa daur vastav main shuru ho gaya he? jab party kii nitiyon par vichaar-vimarsh 10 janpath ke band daravaajon ke peeche tathakthith kor group dwaara nahin kiya jayega? balki uski ghoshnaa jor-shor se or maukey par hi yaa kai baar televijan par prasaarit ho rahi press conference main kar di jaaegi
 In a blink of an eye, rivals like Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu deserve praise
 yahaan tak ki america ke saath parmaanu samjhaute par manmohan singh sarkaar ko giraane kaa bharsak prayaas karne vaale vampanthi bhi ab unke liye achhut nahin rahe hai
 He said, "there is a lot in common between us and the Left
" 
 
 mujhe puraa vishwaas he ki vampanthi manmohan singh ke netritv vaali sarkaar ko samarthan denge
 "congressmen were still searching for the status of Nitish, Naidu and CPI leader A
" bi
 Vardhan rejected his offer to increase his proximity
 iske baad jo kolahal machaa, usamen kisi ko yah yaad nahin rahaa ki rahul ne yah bhi kaha tha ki congress manmohan singh ko pradhanmantri banane ke sawaal par usee tarah nahin jhukegi jis tarah vah parmaanu samjhaute ke maamle main nahin jhuki thi
 Veerappa Moily, president of the media cell, said with some concern, "he is a mature leader
 yadi aapke pratidwandvi acha kaam kar rahe hai to usamen tarif karne main kya buraai he?'' to yah samajhnaa aasaan hi he ki us shaam televijan studio main congressi pravaktaaon kii team utani asahaj kyon lag rahi thi
 He was the same Rahul who attacked the 'livestock' in Kolkata during a campaign a few days ago
 tab ve bhadke the, ''bengal main communist saidhantik ghere main kaid ho gaye hai
 That too in an outdated ideology, which has failed everywhere
 pichley saal main china gaya or chini communiston ne mujhase poocha ki bengal main kis tarah kaa samyawad chal rahaa he? ve log badalte kyon nahin hai?''koi bhi samajhadaar vyakti yah sawaal poochhega
 His mother also spared the communists while visiting the state
 unhone kaha tha, ''rajya sarkaar ko is baat kaa jawaab dena hi hoga ki unhone garibon ke liye kuch kyon nahin kiya?'' thodi der ke liye to pradhanmantri bhi vamapanthiyon ke virodh main khaase saahsee ho gaye the
 Then one day he changed his voice among women journalists, "I have a lot of respect and respect for the leftist allies
 jaisaaki main baar-baar kah chukaa hum, unka saath chhootane kaa mujhe bahut afsos he
 As far as the future is concerned, who can say what about it? Whenever we reach the bridge, we will cross it
 ''party kii taatkaalik pasand manmohan singh, or bhavishya ke liye aprihaary pasand rahul, kaa shaayad yah maananaa he ki ve vahaan (yani satta main) pahunch rahe hai or duuri paatane ke liye unhen puraani pad chuki vichaardhaara kaa samarthan chahie
 Or is it not that Rahul has become the message? a message that defies the party's standard policies
 yaa phir yah ki ve khud hi party ban gaye hai? lagata he ki sahasaa hi unhen apane upnaam kii vishistataa kaa ehsaas ho gaya he
 They have become a one-man organization which is preparing its own agenda and changing it at will
 chunki ve hi aprihaary bhavi netaa he isliye unhen party ke anukool chalane kii jarurat nahin he balki party ko unke hisaab se badalanaa hoga
 His politics based on consciousness has confused the party and pillaged his enemies
 beshak isse unhen samaj paanaa or mushkil hi ho gaya he
 Certainly they are doing a different type of politics and senior party leaders do not understand this
 haalanki adhiktar congressi netaa faisle lene kii prakriya main shaamil nahin hote lekin kisi faisle par pahunchane se pehle congress adhyaksh or unke kareebi gut ke bich bahes ke jo antaheen daur chalate hai, usase ve bakhubi waakif hai
 In contrast, Rahul's approach is completely different
 ve ekala chalo re or manmarjee akraman kii raajnneeti se khush hai
 This type of politics has confused both the friend and the enemy of the party
 rajd pramukh lalu prasad yadav, lojpa ke ramvilas paswan or trinmul congress kii mamata banerjee jaise sahyogi apni jagah apane kshetreey pratidwandviyon ko laae jane ke bachakaana prayaas se naaraaz the
 Paswan wanted to know that if Nitish Kumar is doing such a good job then why is Rahul putting up candidates against him? The temperamental Banerjee termed this act as another example of 'mean seekers and sidelines', for which the Congress has become notorious
 rahul kii tippaniyon ke samay ke chayan par sawaal uthaate hue trinmul ke parth chatarji kaa kahana tha ki ye tippaniyan aise samay ai hai jab pashchim bengal main chunaav ke do charan abhi baaki hai
 He said, "such irresponsible comments cannot be expected from a leader like him
" yah bhi vicitra hi he ki ye tippaniyan aise samay aa rahi hai jab un nirvachan kshetron main chunaav ho chukaa he, jahaan congress ne ummidavaar utaare the
 Even NCP leader Sharad Pawar was not happy with Rahul's sarcasm
 yah poochne par ki kya ve pavaar ko pradhanmantri pad ke liye samarthan denge? rahul kaa jawaab tha ki beshak denge yadi rakanpa akeli sabase badi party ke rup main saamne aati he
 Such sarcasm cannot be said politically in terms of making partners after elections
 lekin congress ke ek mahasachiv kaa kahana he ki rahul kii is sanak main ek ranneeti ho sakati he
 They find this to be part of a carefully designed plan by a mother-son, not an impulsive statement
 ve bataate hai, ''hamaara akalan yah he ki lalu or paswan bihar main is baar utani siten nahin jeet paaenge jitani pichley chunaav main jiti thim
 Both can lose in their respective constituencies
 andhra pradesh main bhi congress ke liye sthiti bahut acchhee nahin he
 Seeing all this, it is prudent to woo new partners
 '' to rahul ke bayaan rajnatik avasarvadita the yaa bina soche-samajhe di gai sound bite, uske baad jo bhram failaa usase yah to spasht ho gaya ki yah party kii ekamat se taiyaar ranneeti nahin thi
 And it is not that Sonia Gandhi has completely handed over the reins of the party to her son
 yah to party netritv sanbhaalane kaa pehla charan bhar he, jisaki shuruyaat sonia ne vidhansabha chunaav ke antim daur main kii thi, jab sonia peeche hat gayi or rahul ko party kaa star prachaarak banane diya
 Now his public personality has added another dimension
 vah he faisle lene kaa
 Rahul has always played an important role in the leadership process of the party
 lekin ab se pehle jab unase yuvak congress se itar maamalon (ve yuvak sanghathanon ke prabharee mahasachiv hai) par unase kuch poocha jaataa to ve sawaalon ko roak dete, ''congress adhyaksh se puuchhie
 "now the change has come that Rahul has started taking decisions even beyond his domain
" 9 mahasachivon main sabase kam umr ke rahul ab yuva prakoshth se pare ke muddon par faisle karne se nahin hichakate
 The party leadership has always paid serious attention to his every word
 yah unka hi faisla tha ki congress ko upie kii chhatari tale loksabhaa chunaav nahin ladanaa chahie
 He is fond of saying that he is not playing one-day matches, but has come to play long innings
 unhen sanghathan ko jamini str se banane kii jarurat he, bhale hi in chunaavon main congress haar jaae
 Frustrated with this, Lalu sarcastically said that all the other leaders are contesting elections, but it is building an idealistic youth Congress
 rahul ne hi party mahasachiv digvijay singh ko sapa ke saath gathbandhan main baadha banane kii ijaajat di
 In a dialogue with the media recently, he said, "uttar Pradesh and Bihar would have been centers of our strength
 or yaheen hamaara janaadhar kaaphi gata he
 "with this he raised the question," We left Lalu and Paswan or did they leave us? "technically they may be right: their allies left them
 lekin congress ke haaavee hone kii pravriti ne hi unhen yah karne ko majaboor kiya
 Apart from this, keeping in view the organizational restructuring, Rahul made a foolish suggestion that 30 per cent tickets should be given to the youth
 haalanki unhone jald hi isamen sudhaar bhi kar liya or apane sahyogiyon ke saamne kabool kiya ki yuvaaon ko pehle vidhansabha chunaav main utaarna thik rahegaa
 Later again, it was said that it would be good to field youth on seats that do not win Lok Sabha elections
 parinamswaroop behad naakhush yuva netaa or rahul ke kareebi krishna byre gauda ko dakshin bengaluru main bhaajapa ke diggaj netaa anant kumaar ke mukaable utaara gaya
 Despite this, Rahul has no shortage of words indicating a change in party culture
 yahaan tak ki bhale hi ve is party kii viraasat ke sarvaadhik vishisht uttaradhikari hai lekin party ke andruni loktantr ke pairokaar bhi bananaa chaahate hai
 He says, "just because i am the product of a system, it does not mean that i cannot change it
" '' saath main yah bhi jod dete hai ki ''isse main kuch khaas kaam karne kii sthiti main bhi ho jaataa hum
 i also consider it my duty and honor to change the system of which i am born
 ''iske baavjood unke is khaake kaa jamini str par koi saboot najar nahin aata
 Most of the young newcomers who got tickets were the lamp of local established political families
 punjab kaa hi udhaaharan len, jahaan aath nae chehre chunaav main utaare gaye
 Three of them belonged to prominent families: Raninder, son of Captain Amarinder Singh, Ravneet Singh Bittu, grandson of Beant Singh and Sukhwinder Singh Danny, son of former Punjab minister Sardul Singh
 unhen is baat kaa garv he ki chunaav prakriya yuvak congress tak pahunch gai he or punjab is maamle main pehla rajya ban adarsh ban gaya he
 Yet when he presents Punjab as a role model, it is also ironic that if anyone emerges victorious in this experiment with democracy, he will be bittu shrugging off, he says, "it is expected that Democracy will come just by pressing a button
 aapako kahin se shuruyaat ko kerani hogi
 "but he himself has a habit of pressing the wrong button
 apni maa kii tarah hi bharat ke liye unka sapana bhi samaajwaad kaa nehruwadi model he
 They want to bridge the distance between India and the country
 ve vamapanthiyon se is maamle main to sahamat hai ki daulat kaa vitaran garibon tak pahunchnaa chahie
 But unlike the communists, they also understand the need to build corporate India
 vikaas kii arthvyavastha main apni em
 Using Phil's degree, he says, "there is a relationship between development and distribution, which the Left ignores
" vamapanthiyon ne hamen rojgaar guarantee yojana par samarthan diya tha, uske liye paisa kahaan se aayaa? aakhir vah aasmaan se to nahin tapakaa tha balki vah 8 fisadi jidipi vruddhi dar kaa pratifal tha
 He spends nights in Dalit and tribal homes, which is also ridiculed by his political rivals and media
 lekin unhen duusare bharat kii khoj ke swechha se kiye gaye faisle par chalane se hatotsahit nahin kar paae
 Despite this, the big idea that brought about change is still missing
 yadi congress jo badlaav chaahati he, ve vah hi hai yaa party manmohan singh ke baad ke jis bharat kaa vipanan karnaa chaahati he, vah bhi yahi he to congress ko apana man-mastishk or vichaar adhik spashtataa se pesh karne honge
 They are not taking a very different route from the past: they use the sinister tradition of Congress to succumb to dynasty for their own benefit

 input:ians After the investigation of Madhya Pradesh's infamous Professional Examination Board (vyapam) scam, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has come into the hands of everyone, hoping for a fair and speedy investigation
 madhya pradesh hycourt kii taraf se niyukt vishesh jaanch dal (esaity) kii nigaraanee main jaanch kar rahe vishesh kaary bal (estf) ne apni jaanch main ab tak sarkari medical collejon or sarkari naukariyon main phixing ke khel kii padtaal kii he
 Apart from this, the investigation of the game of selling the seats of management quota of private colleges i
e
 Demat scam has also started
 lekin india today kii padtaal main pataa chalaa he ki 2009 se 2013 ke bich nijee collejon main sarkari cote kii 721 siton ko bechney ke maamle kii jaanch main estf ne zyada dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 The rigging on these seats was confirmed by the Madhya Pradesh “admission and Fee Regulatory Committee (AFRC) and the Appellate Authority in its order dated May 21, 2015, has asked the AFRC inquiry to be considered further
 vyapam ghotaale ke is hisse ko lekar na to ab tak koi daakhila radd hua he or na hi giraftaar hui he
 In this way, the STF has investigated the entire portion of the Vyapam scam, keeping the same portion in cold storage, whose layers will now be exposed to the CBI
 sheersh jaanch agency kii chunauti isliye bhi badi he kyonki sarkaar ab tak nijee collejon kii madadgaar dikhti rahi he
 Six private colleges of Madhya Pradesh & Viva Medical College & Hospital of Bhopal, People's Medical College & Research Center and LN Medical College & Research Center, r Ujjain
 di
 The order of AFRC in the Appellate Authority was challenged by Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences and Inducts Medical College Hospital and Research Center of Gardi Medical College, Indore
 jaanch main is baat kii pushti hui thi ki nijee collejon main 2009 se 2013 ke bich daakhile kii aakhri taarikh yani 30 sitambar ko bade paimaane par piemti ke jariye pravesh paae chaatr apana naam katwate the or usee din nijee college apni taraf se in siton par nae chaatro kaa pravesh kar dete the
 According to the rule, the students with PMT merit on these seats should have got admission, but the college management made arbitrary admissions keeping this rule in mind
 jaanch main yah baat bhi saamne ai ki collejon ne jaan-boojhkar aisi apaardarshee prakriya apanaai, taaki yogya chaatr counselling ke liye aa hi na saken
 The shocking thing about this scam is that where more than 1,000 admissions of medical colleges in Vyapam scam were canceled after the admission of PMT through rigging and cases against students, even parents, getting unfair benefits
 In the case of arbitrary admissions of private colleges, AFRC has recommended only fine
 or nijee college is jurmaane ko bhi khatm karaane kii firaaq main hai
 Vyapam's whistleblower Dr
 explaining the mathematics of 721 seats
 anand raay bataate hai, “darasal in siton par counselling ke jariye ve chaatr select karaae jate hai jo kisi or chaatr ke solver ke taur par pariksha main baithte hai
 They sit in the exam by copying another student and passing it themselves
 lekin chunki in chaatro ko padhai nahin kerani he, isliye ye log college management ke ishaare par daakhile kii antim taarikh yani 30 sitambar ko hi seat khaali karte hai or baad main college prabandhan in siton ko 35 se 50 lakh ru
 Sells for up to ”sawaal uthta he ki madhya pradesh sarkaar is puure maamle main kya rukh apana rahi thi? iskaa jawaab sitambar 2014 main miltaa he, jab vyapam ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye esaity kaa gathan ho chukaa tha or purv shiksha mantri lakshmikant sharma jail ja chuke the
 The rules of MBBS and BDS admissions were made stricter and provision was made to register an FIR against the head or principal of the college if the disturbances were found
 lekin 6 sitambar, 2014 ko council shuru hone vaale din hi chikitsa shiksha mantri narottam mishra ne exiar ke praavdhaan ko hataa diya or isaki jagah “sakht vaidhanik karrwai” shabd daal diya
 This information was given in response to Anand Rai's RTI application on 9 January 2015
 raay kaa daawa he ki is dauraan un par artiai arji waapas lene ke liye dabaav bhi daalaa gaya
 Nikhil Tiwari, counsel for the Madhya Pradesh High Court, states, “by removing the provision of FIR, the government opened the way for the private colleges to prevent the arrests of the accused in the admission
 yah behad gambhir maamla he
 "this is not the only time when Narottam Mishra stood with private colleges
 30 agast, 2014 ko unhone pramukh sachiv (chikitsa) kaa prastaav palatate hue bhopal ke piples medical college and research centre main 100 siten badhaane ke prastaav ko manjuuri de di
 He argued that this approval should be taken keeping in mind the target of increasing 5,000 medical seats in the state
 lekin pramukh sachiv ne jin daleelon ke aadhaar par manjuuri khaarij kii thi ve kam majboot nahin thim
 Principal Secretary said that between 2010 and 2012, the college rigged the admissions
 yahi nahin, 2011 main to 145 siton kii manyata hone ke baavjood 250 siton par daakhile kara liye
 The Medical Council of India (MCI) had directed the cancellation of 96 admissions here
 iske alaava eeffarsi ne college par 2
 15 crores Rs
 kaa jurmaana bhi lagaaya tha
 That is, the college whose administration was about to revoke the certificate, the education minister gave her full respect
 is bare main puche gaye sawaalon par india today ke phone or esemes sandeshon kaa mishra ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 On the other hand, there is no shortage of charges regarding Viva Hospital
 purv vidhayak paras sakalechaa kaa aarope he ki estf ke ek dspi ne aspataal ke ek sheersh padaadhikari ko 600 baar phone kiya, lekin usase aadhikarik taur par kabhi poochtacha nahin kii gai
 In his statement recorded on August 8, 2014, when the name of the son of the then Municipal Police DSP Rakshapal Singh of Gwalior got into the Vyapam scam, Rakshapal said, “dr
 of Chirayu Hospital
 goyanka” ko 14 lakh ru
 Had said to give iske baavjood ab tak chiraayu aspataal ke maalikon ke saath sakhti nahin kii gai he
 Meanwhile, GM Khanuja, COO of Aurobindo Medical College, Indore, has been arrested in January 2014 for wrongly selecting his son Abhijeet in PMT-2012
 yah giraftaar nijee college main dhaandhlee karne ke aarope main nahin hui he
 That is, the management system of private colleges has been proved to be a matter of handling the investigation till now
 ye kuch pramaan vyapam kii ab tak anchhui or ansulajhi paheliyon kii taraf ishaara kar rahe hai
 On the order of the Supreme Court by the CBI, which has taken up the case and the way the investigating agency is going to set up a separate office in Bhopal to scrutinize the whole case, it may soon start a bad day for the management of private colleges
 is
 vyapam kii ye paraten ghotaale kii khai main kai or bade naamon ko le aaengi, isamen ab zyada andeh nahin he
 By the way, Anand Rai of Indore and Ashish Chaturvedi of Gwalior have already knocked on the door of the Supreme Court in this case

 dilachasp baat ye he ki nai pari ke aagaaj ke saath hi tej bahadur ne ye elaan bhi kar diya he ki wo mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ke khilaaf chunaav ladenge
 That is, Tej Bahadur Yadav, who had filed nomination against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the Varanasi parliamentary seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, has now lashed out against Chief Minister Khattar

 Tej Bahadur Yadav had questioned the quality of food there while staying in BSF
 tej bahadur ne baqayada video record kar soshal media par share kiya tha, jisaki deshbhar main charchaa hui thi
 Tej Bahadur's move was dismissed by the BSF as a violation of the rules
 iske baad se hi tej bahadur lagaataar sarkaar par sawaal uthaate rahe hai or biguef ke faisle ko bhi court main chunauti di he
 In this episode, he had reached Varanasi to contest against PM Modi, but after not getting a chance there, now Tej Bahadur has decided not only to try his hand in Haryana assembly elections, but also directly the head of state and bjp's election face

 com / gn3xuhun11 film actress or kings ilevan punjab team kii ko-honor priti jinta ne apane puraane bwoyfriend ness wadiya ke khilaaf chhedchhad kaa cese darj karaayaa he
 This matter is gradually gaining momentum
 exiaar or priti ke aadhikarik ke bayaan se kai chaunkaane vaale tathy saamne aae hai
 Preity Zinta has alleged that Ness Wadia had threatened to make her disappear and also abused her in public places
 priti jinta ne mumbai police ko apni shikaayat main kaha he ki vah ness wadiya ko pichley 10 saal se jaanati hai or vah ek samay par uske saath relationships main bhi thim par ab vah rishte main nahin hai
 Talk to each other for professional reasons only
 unhone apni shikaayat main kaha he ki ness wadiya akasar unke saath galat vyavhaar karte the
 Preeti has informed the police, 'nes Wadia used very vulgar language for me on the night of the incident
 mere doston or parivaaravaalon ke saamne is tarah se vyavhaar kiya jisase meraa apmaan hua
 'he further said,' Nes Wadia threatened me that night, saying that he would make me disappear because i have no place
 main sirf ek abhinetri hum or vah bahut hi taqatwar shaks he
 i want peace in my life
 par vankhede stadium main jo hua, usase mujhe gaharaa dhakka laga
 Today i am scared for my life
 'priti ne yah jaankaree bhi di he ki unhone iske bare main kai baar bisisiai adhikariyon ko bataaya
 She kept quiet due to the good performance of Kings XI Punjab this season
 vah nahin chaahati thim ki puri ghatana kaa asar team ke pradarshan par pade
 He has alleged that Ness Wadia has called him good and bad several times behind his back and also questioned his character
 iske alaava saarvajanik jagahon par hathapayee tak kii
 What happened that night was told by a close friend of Kopriti Zinta, Ness Wadia abused her by holding Preity's hand that night
 us vakt kai log maujuud the
 All those people are witnesses of this incident
 ness ne priti kaa haath hi nahin pakadaa, behad hi bhaddi bhashaa kaa bhi istemaal kiya
 According to my knowledge, he has been using similar similar language before
 kyonki kings ilevan punjab ne is sijan main acha pradarshan kiya isliye priti chup rahi
 She did not want to lower the morale of the team before the final
 30 may kii vaardaat ke baad final main match dekhne ko lekar priti asamanjas main thi
 However, separate seating arrangements were made for both the people
 priti hameshaa hi is mudde par chup rahi hai or pichley paanch saal main ness wadiya se baat bhi nahin kii
 After the Wankhede Stadium incident, Preeti made up her mind to complain to the police
 chaunkaane vaali baat yah he ki sab kuch saarvajanik taur par hua lekin vahaan par maujuud kisi bhi shaks ne aakar priti kii madad nahin kii
 She is a girl usne akele hi is sharmnaak ghatana ko jhela
 But he is very strong
 isliye police ke saamne ai
 Preity Zinta wrote about this case on Facebook: 'I am not very rich or powerful, but i have worked hard to gain self-respect in my life so far
 main is baat se kaaphi dukhi hum ki pehle jab saarvajanik jagahon par mujhe apamaanit kiya gaya, to kisi ne meraa saath nahin diya
 i have no other option left this time
 yahi vajah he ki mujhe bold step uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 There are times when we have to go through periods of humiliation
 par ham yah sochakar khud ko hi bevakoof banaate hai ki kya hua, yah kisi ne dekha to nahin
 What happened in Wankhede is being ignored like other fabricated things
 yah koi nahin jaananaa chahta ki mere saath kya hua
 i am sure the witnesses of the incident will tell the truth
 mujhe vishwaas he ki is maamle main police thik tareeke se or teji se karrwai karegi
 No woman wants this type of thing to come up
 maine film jagat main 15 saal se zyada vakt tab kaam kiya he
 But i have never had to go through such humiliation before
 main media se vinamrata se anurodh karti hum ki vah mujhe saport kare or is baat par focus kare ki vankhede stadium main mere saath kya hua
 i do not need anyone's sympathy
 'duusari ore, ness wadiya ne kaha ki aise aaropon se unhen jhatka laga he
 He has termed Preity's allegations baseless

 darasal, train main khan-paan saamagree rakhane ke liye paryaapt jagah nahin he
 If the storage space was not increased, food would have to be placed around the toilet
 lihaaja IRCTC ne is bare main suzav die
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said in response to a question on this issue that you must have heard 'only Constant Is Change' in life

 71 of the railway track running from r Block in Patna
 25 acre jameen ab bihar sarkaar kii ho jaaegi
 The Bihar government has decided to give Rs 222 crore to the Railways
 30 june ko railway is jameen kaa malikana haq bihar sarkaar ko saunp degaa
 This is good news for Bihar and especially Patna
 pichley 10 varshon se bihar sarkaar is jameen ko paane kii koshish kar rahi thi lekin centre or rajya main alag- alag vichaardhaara kii sarkaar hone ke kaaran yah sambhav nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 Now there is NDA government at the center and in the state, it became easy for the state government to get this land
 patna ke liye yah badi saugat he kyonki is jameen par 8 kilometre kii 6 len kaa super haive banegaa jo digha main bane jepi brij se judega
 Bihar's Road Construction Minister Nandkishore Yadav said that the road construction work will start in October
 unhone ise rajya sarkaar kii sabase badi uplabdhi bataaya
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, he said that this is a big achievement for the whole of Bihar
 ham is kaam ke liye aaj se nahin lage the, rajya sarkaar pichley lagbhag 8-9 varshon se is kaam main lagi thi
 a lot of rail ministers, all the people spoke but the UPA government did not talk
 sanyog se centre or bihar main donon jagah endie kii sarkaar ban gai
 Double engine of development took place and now it is showing its benefit
 nandakishor yadav ne kaha ki is rail line par sadak banane se keval patna ko hi nahin balki puure bihar ko isse phayda hoga, khaskar uttar bihar jane vaale logon ko kyonki ham is sadak ko digha main bane jepi brij se jodenge
 He said that there is an obstacle in the construction of the road, there is an encroachment in every place, Patna district administration has taken action on it
 rail line ke kinare paanch mandir bhi hai unhen bhi dekhnaa hoga
 Notice is being issued to people to vacate the place
 unhone kaha ki hamen railway ko 222 karod rupee dene hai jo ham 30 june se pehle de denge or uske turant baad railway hamen jameen de degaa
 The railway track will have to be removed from Kamwahan by the end of this year and in the meantime, the work of making DPR (detail project report) has also started
 ham ummid karte hai ki is saal ke ant tak sadak nirmaan kaa kaam ham shuru karenge
 He said that the construction of this road will take 2 years because it is a big project and at least 2 to 2 in big projects
 5 saal lagenge, lekin ham koshish kar rahe hai ki is project par is saal ke ant tak kaam shuru kar den
 He said that along with the 6-lane road, there will be space for the metro in the middle, so that in future the metro can be expanded on it

 i am Ravish Kumar
 to bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon loksabhaa main paas ho gaya
 Now the children of farmers will not become peon drivers
 kendriya mantri virendra singh ne kaha ki 70 pratishat kisaanon ke paas bahut chote aakaar kii zamin he
 Whenever he goes, he recommends to get my son to a peon driver, conductor or police
 kisaanon ko bhi aage badhane kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 Opposition parties, including the Congress, have been crushing the farmers for 50 years so that they do not die, but do not give them a chance to move forward
 duusari taraf virdohi thik ulta aarope laga rahe the ki ye bill kisaan virdohi he
 This will destroy farmers
 in do dhruvon main banty bahes ke baad bhi loksabhaa main bhoomi adhigrahan sanshodhan kaa prastaav bahumat se paas ho gaya
 In the Lok Sabha, Union Minister Chaudhary Birendra Singh laughed everyone and seduced his opponents with his speech
 congress ne ek baar zarur sochaa hoga ki is netaa kaa hamane samay rahete kyon nahin istemaal kiya
 So much praise has been given to his speech style and speaking environment
 bill main aae badlaav se vipaksh kitna santusht hua or kisaan kitna khush hue ye aane vaale dinon main saaf hota jayega
 The government was not short of numbers yet nine amendments were incorporated based on the suggestions of the opposition
 vipaksh ke paas sankhya to nahin thi, magar use sawaal uthaane kaa mauka zarur mila
 Chaudhary Birendra Singh repeatedly explained that the acquisition will be done only by the government and will be for the government only
 vah is dharna se lard rahe the, adhigrahan corporate ke liye kiya jayega
 Now in the new bill, how much is for the farmer and how much for the corporate will be known gradually, when everyone studies each one of the provisions
 unhone kaha ki infrastracchar ke praavdhaan ko corporate ke liye bataaya jaataa he, magar isamen to sinchai or sadak jaisi pariyojnaayen bhi hoti hai
 Social infrastructure has been excluded from the 'non-sanctioned sector'
 privet skool yaa aspataal ke liye koi adhigrahan nahin hoga
 The Industrial Corridor has also been clearly defined that only one kilometer of land will be acquired on either side of the national highway or railway line
 kisaanon ko apane zile main shikaayat yaa apil kaa adhikaar hoga
 Separate records of barren lands will be maintained and at least one member of the displaced family employed
 ab yah saaf nahin ki naukari kis str kii hogi, kyonki choudhary birendra singh ne kaha ki kisaan itnaa laachaar he ki wo apane bacchon ko chaparasi or driver lagavane ke liye sifarish karwaata rahata he
 Hopefully, he will get a good job in a company or project on his land
 vaise driver or chaparasi kii naukari kaa bhi sammaan kiya jaae to acha he
 By the way, this problem of language is not less among us news anchors
 yah saaf nahin he ki bahufasali zamin yaa upjau zamin kaa adhigrahan hoga yaa nahin
 During the voting in the Lok Sabha, some opposition members brought a proposal for amendment but it fell down due to lack of majority
 saamaajik adhyayan ke praavdhaan ko lekar kaaphi bahes hui thi
 The Union Minister said that it has been left to the state governments
 jo rajya sarkaar chaahegi vah kara sakati he
 Congress MP Deepender Hooda said that the government should be included in the new bill but his proposal fell
 kendriya gramin vikaas mantri birendra singh ne loksabhaa main kaha ki pehle to banjar zamin kaa hi survey hoga or ek bank banegaa
 If barren land can come in handy for a project, there will be no acquisition of multi-cropped land or fertile land
 banjar zamin ke bank banane kaa suzav sangh samarthak kisaan sanghathan kaa tha
 Are the plans for development stalled due to the acquisition? modi sarkaar daawa karti rahi he ki upie ke is kanoon ke kaaran kai project funs gaye hai
 They do not have land, but the report of our colleague Srinivasan Jain says something else
 shrinivasana ne sarkaar se jaanane kaa khub prayaas kiya ki koun se project ruke hai, unki suchi mili lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 a list of a large group of industry has definitely been found, which includes the stuck project of 1000 crores
 67 aise project main se sirf saat project hi bhoomi adhigrahan ke kaaran ruke pade hai
 Their combined cost is only 53,677 crores
 yani puure nivesh kaa sirf 13 pratishat
 In September 2013, only 12 projects were disrupted due to a land dispute
 inamen se do sadak or do power project main kuch gati bhi ai he
 According to the report by Srinivasan, this list suggests that there are several reasons for the project to stop
 jo saat product ruke pade hai unamem se chah sadak pariyojnaayen hai
 The 60 projects are stuck due to various other reasons ranging from lack of capital
 bhoomi adhigrahan ko khalanaayak bataanaa thik nahin he
 Chaudhary Birendra Singh said that if the court order takes five or seven years to start the project
 to us paanch saal ko nikaal kar aage ke paanch saal main agar project shuru nahin hota he to zamin lautaani hogi
 That is, the project will have to be completed in the remaining five years after the time spent in the court hurdle
 congress ne sarkaar ke ek bhi sanshodhan ko sweekaar nahin kiya he
 The opposition has demanded that this bill be referred to the Standing Committee
 sarkaar kii sahyogi shivasena ne matdaan main hissaa nahin liya
 Opposition of Shiv Sena can get into trouble in Rajya Sabha
 ediemke, akali dal ne modi sarkaar kaa saath diya
 BJD TRS and Congress walkout from the House
 sarkaar ne yahaan tak to apni patibaddhta dikhaa di
 It now has to pass in the Rajya Sabha, where the government does not have a majority
 lekin kya nae sanshodhan se saare sawaalon ke jawaab mil jate hai, jo kisaan sanghathanon kii taraf se uthaae ja rahe the
 Will the farmers have good days? Prime time 24 farvari ko aane vaali film 'rangoon' main kangana ranot, shahid kapur or saf ali khan kii tikdi pehali baar najar aane vaali he
 Kangana's look of Hunter Girl in the film is being liked a lot, but cold war discussions between her and Shahid have also been heard from many days
 ab kangana ne shahid ke bare main kuch chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye hai
 In an interview to Mid Day, Kangana said, 'during the shoot in Arunachal Pradesh, our team was living together in a cottage
 lekin shahid ke saath cottage share karnaa mere liye kisi bure sapane se kam nahin tha
 Because Shahid used to listen to the loud voice on the speaker every morning, which caused me a lot of trouble
 'trailor main kangana or shahid ke kis or intimet seens kii bhi aajkal kaaphi charchaa he
 But perhaps Kangana did not like doing intimate scenes
 kangana ne kaha, 'mujhe intimet seens pasand nahin
 They have a lot of trouble shooting
 aapkaa kisi ke saath formal equation he or achaanak se aapako use kis karnaa padataa he
 'kangna did not like even Kis' experience with Shahid
 kangana ne kaha, 'shahid kii badi moonche bahut khatarnaak hai
 It was difficult for me to kiss them
 maine jab unase is bare main poocha to unhone kaha ki main is par vaix lagaataa hum or meri naak bhi bah rahi he
 They were teasing me

 Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said that if any country including America and India attacks Pakistan, then in that case their country will stand with Pakistan
 pakistani televijan channel jeeyo news ko die ek saakshaatkaar main karaji ne kaha, ‘‘bhagwaan aisi sthiti ko roke lekin yadi kisi bhi vakt pakistan or america ke bich yuddh hota he to ham pakistan kaa saath denge
 "when Karzai was asked whether Afghanistan would support Pakistan if India attacked, he said," If anyone attacks Pakistan, Afghanistan will support Pakistan
 afghanistan, pakistan kaa bhai hoga or vah apane bhai se vishwasghaat nahin karegaa
 "significantly, a few weeks before this statement, Karzai questioned Pakistan's alleged links with Taliban militants
" unka haalia bayaan aise samay main aayaa he jab hakkaani jaise aatankwaadi samoohon ke khilaaf pakistan dwaara paryaapt karrwai nahin kar paane ke kaaran america or pakistan ke rishton main khatas ai he
 Earlier on Friday, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the US does not want to take unilateral action against terrorist groups like Haqqani but had also demanded Pakistan to take action against the group within a few days or weeks
 jab karaji se yah poocha gaya ki agar bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh hota he to vah kya karenge to unhone kaha, ‘‘agar pakistan par koi bhi hamalaa karata he or is desh ke logon ko afghanistan kii sahaayta kii jarurat padati he to afghanistan, pakistan ke saath khadaa hoga
 After the assassination of former Afghan President and peace envoy Burhanuddin Rabbani, Karzai had raised a lot of questions over Pakistan's role and even said that the Taliban are not capable of doing anything without Pakistan's cooperation
 saakshaatkaar ke dauraan pakistan ke prati karaji kaa rakh kaaphi naram rahaa or unhone is desh ko apana bhai bataaya
 He said, "pakistan is our brother
 pakistan ne afghanistan ke saath chaahe jo bhi kiya ho uske baavjood vah hamaara bhai he
 '' bharat apane itihaas ke sabase gambhirajal sankatse jujh rahaa he or lakhon jindagiyaan or unke saath-saath lakhon kaa rojgaar khatre main he
 This warning given in the NITI Aayog's Joint Water Management Index report released last week was long awaited
 lekin report main bharat kejalaprabandhan main badlaav laane ke jis makasad kii baat kahi gai he, uske liye to ayog kii abhi dikhaai gai tatparta se kahin zyada sakht va dhyeypurna kavayad karne kii jarurat hogi
 In the NITI Aayog report, things are true, "it is a matter of deep concern that more than 600 million people in India are facing water pressure to the highest level, almost 70 percent water in India is polluted, due to which India ranks 120 out of 122 countries in the water quality index
 ''bharat ke jal sansadhano ke sankat kii shuruyaat aankadon se hi ho jaati he
 The NITI Aayog report, without naming the main hydrological data collector of India, ie the Central Water Commission (CWC), puts the water data system in India in the dock
 vah kahati he ki aankade jutaney kaa kaam apane daayre, majbootee or kaaryakshmata main behad simit he, jiske parinamswaroop hamen doum darje ke, asangat or gaiyr bharosemand aankade milte hai
 Now, for this, NITI Aayog has either introduced dishonesty by name of CWC or it is looking politically well or has been straightforward
 report main usne jin aankadon kaa istemaal kiya he unamem se bhi kuch ko lekar gambhir sawaal khadey hote hai
 As an example, statistics say that 1 in India
 2 karod kuen hai jabaki kuch zyada bharosemand aankade is sankhya ko teen karod aankate hai
 Similarly, this report may be the first of its kind in India, but it claims, "this is NITI Aayog's unique and perhaps the first of its kind in the world to develop the Composite Water Management Index
" ''—kuch jarurat se zyada hi atishyoktipurna lagata he
 The report would have been more authentic if the process had been transparent and had been implemented in the hands of a trusted independent team
 report kii yah baat gale nahin utarati ki isaki prakriya main aankadon kaa pramanikaran kiya gaya
 The appointment of IPE Global as an "independent certification agency" also raises many questions

 *** Did Haryana Police bring Panchkula by deleting Gurmeet Ramraheem? In fact, the top officers of the Haryana administration are telling people in a secretly hidden tongue how the Haryana Police brought Gurmeet Ramraheem from the Dera of Sirsa to Panchkula, saying that nothing will happen to them
 adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat gurmeet ramarhim ko yah vishwaas dilaayaa gaya ki zyada kuch nahin hoga
 Dera supporters were allowed to come to Panchkula town
 der raat tak un par zyada kaarywahi nahin kii gai, taaki ramarhim jo sari karrwai tivi par dekh rahaa tha ko vishwaas ho jaae ki prashasan us kar sakhti nahin baratane vaala he
 Gurmeet Rahim along with his daughter Honeypreet were also allowed to go to the jail premises so that Ramrahim would come out of the camp
 ramarhim ko dere se baahar nikaalnaa tha chalanzaj tak se khaas baatcheet main haryana ke home secretary ramanivas ne bhi mana ki sarkaar ke liye sabase bada chalange ramarhim ko uske sirsa sthit 700 acre main faile main dere se baahar nikaalnaa tha
 Police officials said that the administration repeatedly appealed to Baba that nothing special would be done to him and as soon as Gurmeet expressed his desire to get out
 haryana sarkaar ne unhen panchakula kii ore badhane kii ijaajat de di
 As soon as the court convicted Ramraheem for treason on 6 Haryana Police personnel, the administration immediately sent him to the head quarters of the Western Command of the Army so that Baba could not run away due to Paramilitary Army
 yah khabar pehle hi aa gai thi ki baba bhaagane kii koshish kar sakate hai
 And such an attempt also happened
 isi ke chalate ab haryana police ke 6 javaanon par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa darj ho gaya he
 Not only this, the administration has also made a make shift airstrip so that people can be tricked that Ramraheem will be sent from this to Rohtak
 jaise hi baba ko doshi qaraar diya, paramilitary force ne ramarhim ko turant panchakula seshan court se army base main sthit hawaii pattee par khadey helicopter par bithakar rohtak ravaanaa kar diya
 Honeypreet will lead the dera after Gurpreet
 Officials say that Honeypreet was sent along with Ramraheem because he is the one to lead the camp after Ramraheem
 prashasan nahin chahta tha ki haniprit cor deraa samarthakon ke saamne aae or samarthakon ko sambodhit kare
 Due to this, Honeypreet was taken to the guest house of Rohtak Jail
 guest house main jaise hi ramarhim ko rakhaa gaya uske turant baad hi jail adhikariyon ne aakar sabase pehle haniprit ko vahaan se hataaya or uske baad gurprit ko rohtak kii sunahari jail main sthit unke cell main le gaye

 Children and young people learn about tricking stones
 magar, ab ek aisa khulaasa hua he, jo behad pareshaan karne vaala he
 Because now it has come to light that a cleric wearing a dhola of religion is physically abusing innocent children
 ye sab rajdhani srinagar se mahaj 60 kilometre dur sopor ke ek chote se gaanv mondji main hua he
 a cleric is accused of physically abusing young boys by pretending to be a jinn (an invisible human race according to Islamic belief)

 One victim said, 'when i was 11 years old, my uncle took me to Aijaz Sheikh
 usne mere saath kai baar galat kaam kiya
 One night there were 10–11 children at the cleric's house, who would be aged between 11–14

 People used to go to this person, known as Pir, to find a solution to their troubles
 aarope he ki aijaj shaikh apane saath jinn kii takat hone kaa daawa karte hue logon kaa ilaaj karata tha
 He used to say that his genie only talks to boys under 14 years of age
 aarope he ki log pir ke is trep main funs jate the
 He himself used to take the children of relatives near him and others to this person
 maasoom bacchon kaa shoshan karne ke liye bhi ye pir shaikh ashleel hatkande apanaataa tha
 One of the victims, now adult, said, 'sheikh Aijaz had a way of trapping us
 wo pehle hamen sharminda karata tha or phir usee ko aadhaar banaakar hamaare khilaaf apanaataa tha
 We were asked very strange questions
 wo hamase poochta tha ki kya hamane kabhi kisi ladki se shaareerik sambandh banaae hai yaa kya ham kisi ko pasand karte hai'

 in sabake bich narendra modi ko dobaaraa se satta main aane se rokane ke liye congress karnataka model kii tarj par bhi centre main sarkaar gathan kaa daanv chal sakati he
 However, the Congress's first attempt is to form its own government with opposition parties
 aam chunaav ke antim or saatven charan kii voting se ain pehle congress ke mahasachiv gulam nabi aaazaad ne bade raajnneetik sanket die hai
 He is the first Congress leader who said that if his party is not offered the post of Prime Minister after the result, the Congress will not make it an issue but we will not obstruct any other leader in the way of becoming Prime Minister
 congress kaa lakshya kisaan or janvirohi bijepi sarkaar ko satta se ukhaad phenkna he
 Gulab Nabi Azad said that if a coalition government will be formed at the center and it will be formed with the support of anti-bjp parties
 congress sarkaar main shaamil hogi to party ise pratishtha kaa vishay nahin banaaegi
 He claimed that neither BJP nor NDA will come to power at the Center
 aaazaad ke bayaan se saaf taur par samajha ja saktaa he ki congress pradhanmantri pad ke liye bahut haath paanv nahin maaregi balki modi ko rokane ke liye vipaksh ko sahyog kar sarkaar banavaane kii ranneeti par kaam kar sakati he

 No party had got majority in the state
 aise main congress ne bijepi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye jedies kii kam siten hone ke baavjood siem pad dekar sarkaar banavaai thi
 Although the governor made the first offer to form the government, the BJP could not prove its majority
 loksabhaa chunaav main vipaksh dalon ne jis tarah se narendra modi ke khilaaf chunavi jang ladaa he
 Not many parties came under the leadership of the Congress, due to which there are many states including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, where the Congress has to enter the electoral arena alone
 haalanki congress ko ummid he ki 2004 kii tarah chunaav ke baad vipaksh ke ye sabhi dal ekajute hokar modi ko sarkaar main aane se rokane kaa kaam karenge
 Actually it is believed that no party is going to get a single majority in the Lok Sabha elections this time
 aise main congress 2004 kii tarj par apni sarkaar banane kii pehali koshish kar rahi he
 In view of this, on Wednesday, Sonia Gandhi called up the prominent leaders of all the opposition parties and asked that they are in Delhi on 22, 23 and 24 May

 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apni pichhali kai reliyon main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko notebandi ke mudde par jamkar gheraa
 Demonetization has just completed two years, on which Rahul alleged that the Prime Minister no longer speaks on demonetisation
 somvaar ko chhattisgarh ke bilaspur main raily ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri ne rahul gandhi par jamkar palatwaar kiya
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "these people are asking for accounting of demonetisation, today due to demonetization, fake companies were caught and because of that your business was caught and you had to go out on bail"
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki jo maa-bete rupayon kii hera-pheri par jamaanat par gum rahe hai wo aaj modi ko pramaan patr de rahe hai
 He said that money for development was there earlier, but earlier people were buried under the bed
 ye notebandi ke kaaran hi rupaya paisa aayaa, jiske kaaran aaj vikaas ho rahaa he
 PM Modi said that a Congress Prime Minister (rajiv Gandhi) had said that if 1 rupee comes out of Delhi, then 15 paise reaches, which pawn used to carry 85 paise in the middle
 unhone kaha ki notebandi ke kaaran hi ye paisa baahar niklaa he
 What allegations has Rahul Gandhi made? Let me tell you that in many of his rallies, Rahul Gandhi has surrounded the Prime Minister on the issue of demonetisation
 haal hi main rahul ne kaha tha ki chunaav se pehle narendra modi pehle bhrashtachar, naukari kii baat karte the
 But now it is said that sweep, do the cleaning
 piem modi ab notebandi par nahin bolte hai
 Rahul had said that if the Prime Minister speaks on demonetisation, people will drive him away from the stage
 chhattisgarh ke bare main
 
 
 Let us tell you that there are total 90 assembly seats in Chhattisgarh
 rajya main abhi kul 11 loksabhaa or 5 rajyasabha kii siten hai

 What were the results in the 2013 election
 
 
 2013 main vidhansabha chunaav ke nattejey 8 disambar ko ghoshit kiye gaye the

 raman singh kii aguwai main bijepi ko 2013 main kul 49 vidhansabha siton par jeet mili thi
 While the Congress was able to win only 39 seats
 jabaki 2 siten anya ke naam gai thim
 Despite the BJP getting three seats less than in 2008, they formed their government with an absolute majority

 The US and China are reaching a trade war situation
 america dwaara china ke 1300 utpaadon par adhik tex ke elaan ke mahaj 11 ghante baad china sarkaar ne palatwaar karte hue america tregeri bond par dhamkee de di he
 China is the largest buyer of US government treasury bonds
 lihaaja america ne sabase zyada videshi karj china se liya he
 Following Trump's decision in the direction of a trade war, China has indicated that it may cut its US Treasury portfolio
 vahiin china ne saaf shabdon main yah bhi kaha he ki yadi america china ke saamne pratibandh lagaataa rahegaa to uske liye kisi yuddh main newclear opshan khulaa rahegaa
 China's next bet: US foreign debt tax expensive China government has about 1
 17 trillian dollar kii america tregeri maujuud he
 Because of this, China is America's largest foreign lender
 yadi china sarkaar trade war ke chalate apane tregeri portpholiyon main katautee kii pahal karata he to kuch jaankaron kaa daawa he america sarkaar ke kharch kshamta ke saamne kadi chunautiyaan khadi ho jaaegi
 This move by China will increase the US bond yield and make it expensive for the US government to take foreign debt to meet its expenditure
 haalanki dabl line capital alpi ne news agency riter ko bataaya he ki jabatak china ke paas america bond maujuud he tabatak is trade war main china kaa palada baari rahegaa
 But if China takes steps to cut its investment in bonds, then it will have to lose its advantage
 dollar or yuan main ched de jangbeete ek saal ke dauraan china ne global karency market main dollar ke mukaable apni karency yuan ko khadaa karne kaa kaam kiya he
 At the same time, President Donald Trump has been continuously alleging that China works deliberately to devalue its currency so that it can benefit in trade against the dollar
 gauratlab he ki kisi desh ko apni karency main jaanboojhkar badlaav karne kaa phayda export main miltaa he
 This reduced value of domestic currency makes it more profitable for producers to export and the government benefits from increasing dollar reserves
 ise padhein: trump ke trade war kaa jawaab, ab china yuan ko degaa dollar jaisi majbooteevahin america ke liye china ko jawaab dene ke naam par yah kaam karnaa vah phayda nahin degaa, kyonki dollar vaishvik str par sabase bharosemand karency he or is kadam se uski karency ke mukaable anya karency global market main majboot hone kaa khatra he
 If the trade war between the two countries takes serious form in the days of attacking the US auto sector, then the auto sector of both the countries will have to bear its huge expense
 haalanki nuksaan ke maamle main yah america ke liye china se zyada badi chunauti he
 China buys about 2,70,000 vehicles from America
 ford, testla jaisi companiyon kii america or europe main sthit production unit china ko ye gaadiyaan supplai karti he
 In the event of a trade war becoming severe, China may take steps to stop the purchase of American vehicles or impose additional taxes, which may pose a challenge to the American auto sector to run a production unit
 america-china main ghamasangauratlab he ki pehle america ne steel or aluminium emport par 25 or 10 fisadi kramash: atirikt tarriff kaa elaan kiya
 In response, China has imposed a $ 3 billion tariff on 128 products imported from the US
 donon deshon ke bich machaa yah ghamaasan yaheen nahin khatm nahin ho rahaa
 The US has announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on about 1300 products imported from China
 ise padhein: guadar bandargah hi nahin pakistan ke punarnirmaan ke bade mishan par juta he chinakyon chhid rahaa trade wardonald trump kaa maananaa he ki unhen apane sabase bade trading partner china se vyapaar main ek bada ghaataa uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 The Trump administration's decision is expected to generate additional revenue of about $ 50 billion to the US
 america kii daleel he ki china ke saath in utpaadon main kaarobaar kaa sidhaa phayda china kii companiyon ko mil rahaa he
 The US alleges that China has resorted to a poor industrial policy intended to harm America
 trump kaa daawa he ki china kii audyogic niti se na sirf vaishvik kaarobaar balki vaishvik suraksha par bhi khatra paidaa hota he
 The American argument is absurd: China has made its stand clear on these decisions of the Chinese Trump government
 china sarkaar ne kaha ki vah america ke saath kisi bhi mudde par baatcheet ke liye taiyaar he
 But China has also claimed that if the US government is trying to wage a war against it in global business, then China will continue to oppose the US till the end in this war

 kendriya mantrimandal ne ek saath teen talaak ko dandaneey aparaadh banane vaale ordinance (adhyadesh) ko buudhvaar ko manjuuri di he
 The President signed it on Wednesday night
 iffdhyadeshse yah saaf hota he ki bijepi aane vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main zyada se zyadamuslimmahilaon ke vot hasil karne kii disha main gambhirtha se kaam kar rahi he
 The BJP is actually working on a strategy to divide Muslim votes
 is adhyadesh ke dwaara yah koshish he ki muslim maton ko purush-mahila main baant diya jaae or muslim mahilaon ke maton ko apane paale main kar liya jaae
 It is also clear that this ordinance aims to get more votes during assembly elections than Lok Sabha elections
 isaki vajah yah he kitripal talaidhyadesh kii samay avadhi chah maheene hi hogi
 Before this, the Modi government will have to pass the Muslim Women (protection of Marriage Rights) Bill 2017
 is sarkaar ke kaarykaal main ab sansad kaa antim ek hi prabhavi satr bachaa he jisaki shuruyaat november yaa disambar main ho sakati he
 The bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha and is pending in the Rajya Sabha
 sansad kaa monsoon satr 18 july ko shuru hua tha or 10 agast ko khatm hua tha
 After this, the Modi government waited about one and a half months to bring the ordinance
 agle kuch maheenon main hi paanch rajyon empi, rajasthan, chhattisgarh, mizoram or telugana main vidhansabha chunaav honge
 Telangana has a large population of Muslims
 lekin vahaan vidhansabha chunaav sambhavat: loksabhaa ke saath hi karaae jaaen
 From the ordinance on triple talaq, it seems that BJP is trying to impress Muslim women especially from the four assembly constituencies
 lekin kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ne isaki vajah kuch or bataai
 Talking to the media after the cabinet meeting, he said that it was forced to do so due to the urgent need and the urgent need
 unhone kaha ki janvari 2017 se is saal 13 sitambar tak tripal talaak ke 430 maamle sarkaar kii notice main aae hai
 Even after the Supreme Court's decision on triple talaq, 201 cases have come up
 unhone daawa kiya muslimmahilaayeinisase kaaphi kathinaayee kaa saamana kar rahi hai, khaskar upi main jahaan janvari 2017 se ab tak tripal talaak ke 246 maamle saamne aae hai
 Now one has to think what was the urgency and compulsion for the government, that it could not wait two months more
 abhi yah tay bhi nahin he ki sheet satr main tripal talaak bill paarit ho paaegaa bhi yaa nahin
 If the weapon of ordinance was successful in the assembly elections, then in the Lok Sabha elections also the government will surely repeat it
