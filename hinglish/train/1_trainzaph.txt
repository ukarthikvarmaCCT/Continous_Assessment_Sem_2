 apane kaarykaal kaa aadha safar puraa kar lene ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ko achche se pataa tha ki 2019 main dobaaraa pradhanmantri banane kaa unka mauka is bajet par tikaa hua he
 He was also aware of the fact that there was widespread support for his surprise exercise to root out black money, but now he needs to apply some ointment to the wounds caused by demonetisation
 sir par uttar pradesh kaa vidhansabha chunaav bhi khadaa tha, jahaan bijepi kii haar unke kaarykaal ke bache hue varshon par asar daal sakati thi
 Apart from this, there were some other important concerns
 notebandi se bharat kii aarthik chaal kaaphi dhimi ho chuki thi or unki sarkaar ko yah sweekaar karne ko majaboor hona padaa tha ki jidipi kii vruddhi dar 7
 5 per cent to 6

 Private sector investment had gone into a trough and profits and demand for key sectors were declining
 notebandi se pehle hi dub chuke karjon ke boj tale bank ab korporate ko udhaar dene main satark ho chuke the, bhale hi ab unke paas khub paisa aa chukaa tha
 The Prime Minister was also deeply concerned about the famine in the country in which the cash crisis was working in leprosy, especially the condition of the informal sector was bad
 ek sanket yah tha ki mahatma gandhi gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana main maujuuda varsh main rojgaar kaaphi kam hue hai

 Everyone hoped that they would give the economy a strong dose that would bring back the GDP growth rate to 7 per cent by correcting the sluggishness and collapse
 bajet banaate samay modi or jetali ne vittiya dussahas yaa loklubhaavanavaad main funsane se khud ko bachaa liya
 Instead, he emphasized four important areas: how to boost investment, how to generate demand, how to generate employment and how to maintain financial balance no matter how impractical it may seem
 modi ke liye nijee taur par do anya chintaaen thim—unke dimag main ek baat saaf thi ki bajet aisa hona chahie jo unki garib samarthak chhavi ko rekhaankit karata ho
 Apart from this, it was also important that the budget should show that demonetisation was not an end in itself but was a tool in the war against black money
 isliye modi or unki team ne jokhim uthaane kaa faisla liya or bharat par apana daanv laga diya—vah bharat jiske gaanvon or shaharon main vanchit aabaadi kaa vaas hota he
 Since there was little scope for expansion in large capital, it was decided to increase spending on important public welfare programs and schemes to boost investment

 The best results were in the road sector, where Jaitley claimed that after the NDA government came to power in 2014, 1,40,000 km of roads were constructed ie 160 km per day
 unke bajet main is kshetra ko 2017-18 ke liye 64,900 karod ru
 Were allocated
 yah 12 fisadi kaa ijapha he
 Since the construction sector was largely informal, any increase in investment would have led to more employment, especially for unskilled laborers
 maang or rojgaar ko teji dene ke liye modi or unki team ne bharat kii buniyadi jarurat par dhyaan diya ki har kisi ko roti or kapade ke alaava ek makaan kii jarurat hoti he
 Every Indian needs a house that he can call home

 One of these decisions was to give affordable housing the status of infrastructure which would be helpful in reducing interest rates on bank loans and also targeted to build one crore houses by 2019 under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
 rojgaar srijan ke maamle main bade kaarobaaron par bharosa karne ke bajaae inhone faisla kiya ki iske liye atilaghu, laghu or majhole udhyamon par vishwaas tikaaya jaae
 He focused on "chhota Hi Achhe"

 Were paying taxes at an effective rate of 3 per cent whereas for large industries this rate was 25
 9 fisadi thi
 In one setback, Jaitley reduced the income tax to 25 per cent for small companies whose annual turnover was Rs 50 crore
 tak kaa he
 The same approach was also adopted for low earners, whose income was Rs 5 lakh
 se kam he taaki unhen bhi acha mahasoos ho sake
 3 total paying taxes
 7 karod logon main 80 fisadi log isi aay shrenee main aate hai
 For these, Jaitley reduced the income tax to almost zero and claimed that by encouraging this, more and more people will file income tax returns in future, which will widen the scope of income tax

 To curb black money arising from political donations, Modi knew that it would be difficult to change the Representation of People Act because his party does not have a majority in the Rajya Sabha
 isiilie unhone iske liye bajet kaa istemaal kiya or benami chande ke aakaar ko kam karne ke saath chande kii nigaraanee ke liye chunavi bond kii pranali kaa elaan kar daalaa
 In the end, Modi has finally resolved the greed to spoil financial discipline
 agar unhone vah raah chuni hoti, to sambhav he ki unhen gharelu morche par kaaphi saraahna milti lekin usase mudrasphiti kaa khatra paidaa ho jaataa jabaki sarkaar ne use kaabo main rakhane kaa haal hi main daawa kiya tha
 Anyway, many foreign investors had strongly criticized demonetisation and Modi was eager to show the world that his government believed in continuity, stability and financial consolidation, as one official said, "A Lakshman Rekha for us We did not have to cross
 " unhone yah bhi dhyaan rakhaa ki aisi kisi bhi yojana kii ghoshnaa na karen jisase ve chunaav ayog ke nishane par aa jaaen
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley expressed confidence that his fourth budget would prove to be a reversal and said in his speech, "if my goal is right, the floor is visible to me, the wind is favorable then i can fly
" " sansad main vitt mantri arun jetali ke bajet pesh karne se kuch minute pehle kendriya cabinet kii baithak hui jaisaa ki rivaaj he
 In the meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told his colleagues in an unusually strong voice, "read the budgetary provisions of your ministry by applying magnifying glass and make sure that everything gets done by April 1
 "pradhanmantri narendra modi ko achche se pataa he ki delivery ke maamle main agar unhone apni sarkaar or afasarshahon par jarurat se zyada bharosa kiya to ve ladkhdaa jaaenge
 The main criticism of the budget is that instead of reducing the interference of the government, it has further expanded the role of the Government of India in development
 duusari aalochana yah he ki jetali ne urvarak or khaadya padaarthon par sabsidi ko kam karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya, balki nae bajet main yah bad gaya he
 Finance Secretary Ashok Lavasa had urged that they cannot reduce the food subsidy as more and more states have now come under the National Food Security Act
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne kamiyon ko dur karne ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya he or yah sunishchit kiya he ki pratyaksh laabh hastantaran ke madhyam se sabsidi logon tak sidhe pahunch sake
 Critics of Modi say that instead of thinking about the next generation, the prime minister always keeps an eye on the next election
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki ve sirf bolte hai, karte kam hai
 Now the question arises whether Modi is a great troubleshooter who is taking the sinking boat of India from the inundation to prosperity and prestige? Or is he a king who does not have clothes on his body and will soon be exposed? The question is, which of the two do you believe in the story? railway (RRB) ne haal hi main trek main ke padon par bhartee ke liye vigyaapan jari kiya tha
 There are 2600 posts of track man to be admitted
 in padon parritred railway karmchaaree aavedan kar sakate hai

 61 varshiya gulam mohammad vastanvi ke hawaale se kaha gayah aaie ham aage badhen, dange aath saal pehle hue the or aaj musalmaan gujarat main vikaas ke laabhbhogi hai
 His statement in the newspaper was accepted as a compliment to Modi and the Tulaba (students) and maestro of the madrasa located in Saharanpur, which had revolted against the British in 1857, played a bugle of revolt against their own Mohtamim
 mohatamim ko hataane kii maang karte hue madrase ke 40 tulaba 24 janvari ko bhukh hadtaal par baith gaye
 In the uproar over Mohtamim, the media used to add fuel to the fire
 urdu times ne likhaa, ''moulana vastanvi ke bayanon ne na sirf musalamaanon ko chaunkaa diya, unase modi bhi hairat main rah gaye honge
 "the fire editorial said:" Maulana should tell who has given him the right to forgive the perpetrator of the heinous crime
 ''lekin vastanvi ke samarthakon kii bhi kami nahin thi
 Islamic scholar Maulana Waheeduddin Khan said, "his statement was a step towards bringing positive thinking to the Muslim community
" '' vastanvi virdohi or samarthak bayanon se daarul ulum vivaad kaa centre ban gaya, jo aam musalamaanon ke saath hi khud vastanvi ko bhi nagavar tha
 On 23 February, Vastanvi formed a committee to investigate three cases at the majlis-e-shura meeting

 But the report of this inquiry committee presented in Shura on 23 July was incomplete
 usamen vastanvi se jude mudde kii jaanch kii gai or baaki muddon ko chhod diya gaya
 Voting was conducted keeping the institute's constitution in mind and except four members, the rest voted against them
 pehle istipha na dene par amada vastanvi ne ''daarul ulum kii garima or pratishtha banaae rakhane kii khatir shura ke faisle ko kabool kar liya

 Born in Vastan village in south Gujarat and educated in the Tadkeshwar madrasa near Surat, Vastanvi grew up as a reformist and educationist at Jamia Islamia Ishaatul Uloom in Akkalkuan in Nandurbar district of Maharashtra

 blog ke mutabik tab is mailaware ko istemaal karne ke liye criminals ko atm mendyrect acces kii jarurat hoti he
 Direct access means going to the ATM and somehow malware is injected or the malware is injected through the ATM network

 According to Kaspersky, to avoid such an attack, security measures like default security policy and device control have to be taken

 The real reason for the initial clash between Faheem Khan and another gangster, Babla, was the recovery from private transporters, which in the terminology here is called 'agenda'

 The way to power of the country goes through UP and to win UP it is necessary to win Purvanchal
 isi formule se 2014 ke loksabhaa or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main upi main sabase zyada siten hasil karne vaali bijepi ab 2019 kii jang fatah karne ke liye purvanchal main paith banane kii koshish main he
 After Prime Minister Narendra Modi Maghar, to hold Purvanchal, now sp's patron Mulayam Singh will hold a rally on 14 July in Yadav's parliamentary constituency
 is dauraan modi jahaan uttar pradesh sarkaar kii sabase badi pariyojna purvanchal express-ve kaa shilanyas karenge, vahiin kuch nai yojanaon kii ghoshnaa bhi kar sakate hai
 Let me tell you that there was a public meeting of PM Modi at Maghar in Sant Kabir Nagar
 is dauraan modi ne sapa or basapa sahit tamaam vipakshi dalon par hamalaa kiya tha
 It is believed that they may give further aggression to this attack in Azamgarh
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main azamgarh purvanchal kii iklauti seat thi, jahaan bijepi nahin jeet saki thi
 Not only PM Modi, but BJP President Amit Shah is also trying to help Purvanchal
 shah ne buudhvaar ko purvanchal main mishan-2019 kaa tanabana vindhyachal dham se bunane kaa faisla kiya he
 They are reaching Mirzapur and Varanasi on 4 July
 shah yahaan se avadh, kaashi or gorakhpur praant ke 30 loksabhaa kshetra ke prabhariyon ke saath baithak kar jamini str par sanghathan va janata kii nabj tatolenge
 Significantly, to prevent Modi from coming to power, opposition parties are coming together in UP
 purvanchal ke gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa upachunaav main sapa-basapa kii ekta se bijepi chaaron khaane chit ho gai thi
 After this, the opposition's strength of unity was also seen in Kairana in western UP, where RLD defeated BJP
 upachunaav main mili jeet ke formule se utsahitsapa, basapa or congress 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaavamein mahagathbandhan banaakar utarane kaa man bana rahe hai
 The churning continues with the seat sharing between the three parties
 mana ja rahaa he ki mahagathbandhan ke sahyogiyon ke bich siton kaa talmail bahut kuch tak 2009 par aadhaarit hoga, kyonki 2014 main to vipaksh puri tarah se dharaashai ho gaya tha
 If 2009 is made the basis, then there will be fierce tussle between the three parties, because if we consider the results of 2009 seats in Purvanchal region, there is not much difference between the three parties
 aankade bataate hai ki tab 21 main se sarvaadhik aath seat basapa ko, 7 sapa or 6 seat congress ko mili thim
 While speaking of 2014, only SP got one seat, that too when Mulayam Singh himself came out of Azamgarh
 aise main ab dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki congress, sapa or basapa ke bich siton kaa talmail kaise hota he, kise kitni siten milti hai
 If the Opposition enters the grand alliance in 2019, it will not be easy for the BJP to repeat the results like 2014
 varanasi jaisi seat chhod den to purvanchal kii zyaadaatar siten bijepi ke haathon se nikal jaaengi
 If the Purvanchal slips from the hands of BJP then it will be difficult to reach the power of the country
 upi ke badale siyaasi mizaaj ke tahat bijepi ke liye purvanchal ko sadhana kaaphi ahm ho gaya he
 Perhaps this is the reason why PM Modi and Amit Shah are focusing more on Eastern Uttar Pradesh than Western Uttar Pradesh
 bijepi kii pradesh ikai purvanchal ke kai jilon main modi kii reliyaan karakar maahaul ko apane paksh main banane kii koshish main jute gai hai
 It is believed that the party has made a plan for the PM to hold a rally in UP every month

 Although everyone's tongue is discussed, only Uttar Pradesh
 yahaan tak ki sabase zyada satta bhi uttar pradesh chunaav parinaam par hi lag rahaa he
 The prices of states like Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand are also open but speculators are not much
 manipur kaa to bhav hi nahin khulaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi may be on target of opponents for campaigning in Varanasi for three days, leaving the work of the country, but if the bookies believe that this smokeless campaign has changed the picture of Uttar Pradesh elections
 shuruaati daur main duusare number par dikh rahi bijepi 8 march ko aakhri charan kaa matdaan puraa hote hi number ek par najar aane lagi he
 However, the speculative market is also in a dilemma about how many seats the BJP will get and whether it will get a majority or not
 isliye alag-alag siton ke liye alag-alag bhav khulaa he
 Uttar Pradesh, with a total of 403 assembly seats, needs 202 seats for a majority
 satorion ne iske liye bijepi kaa bhav 160 seat se kholaa he jo 22 paise he
 Similarly, the price of 42 paise for 170 seats, 80 paise for 180 seats, one rupee for 190 seats and one rupee for 200 seats is 80 paise
 matlab saaf he ki satorie bhale maan rahe hai ki bijepi sabase badi party banakar ubharegi lekin bahumat ke liye jaruri 202 siten laa paaegi isaki ummid kam hi he

 The SP and Congress alliance is priced at 42 paise for 130 seats, 80 paise for 140 seats, 90 paise for 150 seats and 2 for 160 seats
 50 rupee he
 That is, in the eyes of the bookies, SP and Congress do not seem to be moving beyond 150 seats

 Chhattisgarh is going to have municipal elections after just four months, which Congress wants to win and retain its supremacy
 isi maddenjar obisi samudaay ko saadhane ke liye bhupesh baghel ne unke aarakshan ko doguna kar diya he

 iske alaava asti samudaay ko 32 fisadi ko jas kaa tas rakhaa he
 In this way, the total scope of reservation has been increased from 58 to 72 per cent
 supreme court tak pahunchaa tha maamalabta den ki kareeb saat varsh pehle chhattisgarh main raman singh ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar ne aarakshan niti main badlaav karte hue 18 janvari 2012 ko adhisuchana jari kii thi
 Under this, section four of the Public Services (reservation of SC, ST and Backward Classes) Act 1994 was amended

 Iraq is once again in danger
 kyonki duniya kii sabase khoonkaar aatankwaadi sanghathan ne qatlogarat se ek aisi ibaarat likhni shuru kar di he ki agar wo apane mansoobey main kaamyaab ho gaye to samaj lijie ki duniya kaa nakshaa hi badal jayega
 Crusaders are advancing rapidly
 or alam ye he ki kai shaharon par apane kabje main karne ke baad wo log ab rajdhani baghdad se
 
 bas chand kilometre ke faasale par pahunch gaye hai
 
 alam ye he ki iraq kii is khoonkhaar halchal ne duniya ke sabase taqatvar mulk ko bhi baichaiyn kar diya he
 Sunni rebels calling themselves Islamic State of Iraq and the Luvent have begun to build up doom in Iraq
 iraq ke chah shaharon ko kabje main karne ke baad sunni vidrohi ab iraq ke sabase pavitra shahar samaara ke sabase najadik ja pahunche hai
 The Sunni rebels, just 55 kilometers from Samara, have camped on Sunday night
 or jaise jaise unka kafila aage bad rahaa he
 The scenes of destruction and death are being left behind
 shiyaon or kurd ladaakon se milane vaali madad ne iraqi phujon ko hausala to diya he
 Therefore, Iraqi forces have begun an attempt to stop the jihadist army near Salahdin and Diyala
 isi bich america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ne saaf ishaara kar diya he ki unke paas in ladaakon se nibatane kaa vikalp puri tarah se khulaa he or wo kabhi bhi hawaii sainya karrwai karne ke liye apni sena ko nirdesh de sakate hai
 Even the aircraft carrier USS HW Bush has been deployed in the Arabian Gulf
 or iske saath do or yudhpot tainaat kiye gaye hai
 But the US has also made it clear that the US military will not be launched on the soil of Iraq
 udhar iran ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani kaa kahana he ki agar america iraq main karrwai karata he to vah bhi madad karne ko aage aa sakate hai
 It is worth noting that Tal Afar has a predominantly Sunni and Shia population
 saath hi usamen kuch turk bhi hai
 The problem is that there is a problem in India hundreds of miles away from Iraq
 bharat sarkaar ne iraq main maujuud bharatiyon ko vahaan se turant nikalne kii hidaayaten di hai or vahaan ke duutavas ko iske liye khaastaur par intjaam karne ko kaha he
 Two days ago, the rebellion was that the army of the rebels was fighting against the army outside a city
 lekin dekhte hi dekhte do dinon ke bheetar sunni vidrohiyon ne vahaan ke kai shaharon ko apane kabje main kar liya he
 Iraq has become one of the most talked about countries in the world due to persecution and war
 vah iraq kii, jiske swayambhu raashtrapati saddaam hossain ne apane jite-ji kabhi apni nigahen nichi nahin kii
 Moreover, he did not shy away from destroying the world's most powerful nation ie the US
 lekin ab isi saddaam hossain ke iraq kii jo nai tasviir duniya ke saamne he, usne achche-acchon ko chaunkaa diya he
 Many countries of the world are now beginning to feel the condition of Iraq
 koun he wo bhalaa? jisaki vajah se irakiyon kii ruh phna ho rahi he?akhir kya he wo shay? koun he wo bhalaa? jisane ek mulk ke taur par iraq ke vajood par hi khatra paidaa kar diya he? jiske khoff se iraqi fouj ghutane techne par majaboor ho gai he? jiske booton kii awaz se jidaar irakiyon kii ruh phna ho rahi he? or jiske aane kii aahat se faujee apane seene se vardi utaar kar bhaagane lage hai? to janaab, aaie is shaks se bhi aapkaa tarruf karaae dete hai
 This person is none other than the world's richest terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the head of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-baghdadi
 duusare lafzon main kahen to wo shaks he, jo ab iraq ke saath-saath tamaam north africa deshon ke liye khoff kaa vahshat kaa sabase bada naam ban chukaa he
 Why ISIS terrorists surrounded Iraq? But now the question arises that after all why ISIS terrorists have surrounded Iraq like this? After all, why are the ISIS khurdkukes moving ahead by cutting the Iraqi army like a carrot and radish? And in the last few days, how have the militants of this organization captured the three Iraqi cities of Faluja, Tirakit and Mosul? So the answers to these questions are no less shocking
 darasal, iesas wo aatankwaadi sanghathan he, jo iraq samet kai mulkon main islam ke naam par apana raaj kaayam karnaa chahta he or koshish main usne ab iraq ke ek bade hisse par kabja kar liya he
 The situation is that due to this arrogance in this country, where 5 lakh people are living homeless in their own country as refugees, hundreds of people have lost their lives
 kaale kapadon main lipte ye aatankwaadi jahaan bhi jate hai, kaale jhande laga dete hai
 And after this, there are only two routes before the Iraqi people
 yaa to in kaale jhandon kii gulaami kubul kar lenaa yaa phir aatankwaadiyon kii mukhalifat kar jaan se haath dho baithna
 The situation is that while countless innocents have lost their lives in Iraq as targets of terrorists' bullets, the government is carrying out the truce
 maujuuda reporton ke mutabik tamaam atyaadhunik hathiyaaron se las iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne sabase pehle iraqi shahar faluja par kabja kiya or tab tirakit par
 Even then there was a lot of respect
 lekin ab had ye he ki aatankwaadiyon ne baghdad ke baad iraq ke sabase bade shahar or baghdad se faqat 400 kilometre dur mosul ko bhi apane kabje main kar liya he
 Militants of this organization, now attacking with rocket launchers, mowing tanks and ramming bullets, are now spreading in Iraq
 isse iraq kii sadakon par mache maut ke tandav ke bich laashen to bich hi rahi hai, ek mulk ke taur par iraq lagaataar kamazor padane laga he
 After all, who is the leader of Abu Bakradia's richest terrorist organization, the world's most powerful terrorist and the most wanted terrorist of the world after Al Qaeda's Chief Al Jawahri, Abu Bakr al-baghdadi wants to establish a state of terror in Iraq
 to akhir koun he ye abu bakar
 
 or kya he uski shakhsiyat?ibrahim awwaad ibrahim ali badri
 Alias abu Bakr al Baghdadi
 urf invizible shaikh
 Alias dr
 Ibrahim
 naam ek, shaks ek, pahchaan bhi ek
 But take pictures alqaida ke cheef al javaahari ke baad duniya ke is most wanted aatankwaadi kii jo sabase badi pahchaan he, wo yahi ki use poshida rahanaa hi pasand he
 But even after staying behind the mask, the person is shocked to hear about the murder-o-garaat that he has done so far
 ji haa, yahi wo shaks he, jis par iraq main barpe maujuuda kahar ke mastermind hone kaa ilzaam he
 In other words, it is Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, under whose leadership ISIS militants are trying to destroy Iraq
 or yahi vajah he ki yues state department main is shaks kaa zindaa yaa murda pataa denevaale ko kul 10 million yues dollar ke inaam kaa elaan kiya he
 This amount is the second highest amount after the US prize, which is 25 million US dollars, placed on the head of Al Jawahri
 vaise to abu bakar al bagdadi ke koharaam ke kisse kaafii lambey hai, lekin is baar usne jis tarah aadhe iraq ko bandhak bana liya he, wo uskaa ab tak kaa sabase bada daanv he
 The biggest robbery is Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, led by ISIS militants not only captured the second major city of Iraq, Mosul, but also robbed the central bank of Mosul in this connection
 The history has also been named after him
 kya aap jaananaa nahin chahenge ki is lut main bagdadi or uske gurgon ne kitni rakam batori? to suniye
 This amount was 500 billion Iraqi dinars i
e
 about 25 hundred crores rupees
 osma bin laden kaa mureed rahaa he bagdadi16 may 2010 ko iesas ke mukhiya ke taur par duniya ke is sabase amir aatankwaadi sanghathan kii kaman sanbhalanevaala bagdadi pehle se alqaida ke commander osma bin laden kaa mureed rahaa he
 People remember how after the death of Laden he not only talked about revenge but also to form an Islamic country including all the Levant countries including Iraq, Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Turkey
 Had announced lekin uski ye manshaa ek rose iraq par is kadar kahar ban kar tuutegi, ye khud iraq ko bhi pataa nahin tha
 But Baghdadi, which has been massacred with the intention of occupying Iraq, has not only gone far ahead in its target, but has proved to be a headache for Iraq as well as the whole world
 invizible shaikh pad chukaa he namaise america kaa khoff kahen yaa phir li se hat kar rahane kaa tarika, osama bin laden or al jawahiri ke saath saalon saal kaam karne ke baavjood al bagdadi ne ab tak apana naa to apana koi video jari kiya he or naa hi kabhi khul kar camere ke saamne hi aayaa he
 Even many of the big commanders of his organization have never seen this boss face to face and then his name has become invisible
 iraq ek baar phir jang ke muhane par khadaa he
 The terrorist of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
 
 Has triggered rebellion against the Iraqi government
 aise main
 
 aaj iraq kaa sabase bada himachati america ye saaf kar chukaa he ki agar zaroorat padi
 
 to wo jang ke maidan main kud saktaa he
 So is Iraq at the cusp of war again? Will the military start again in Iraq? Will the American army again enter Iraq? Or will ISIS succeed in its intent? One by three Iraqi cities But with the capture of ISIS, the world's richest terrorist organization, these questions are once again floating in Fiza
 garaj ye ki ek taraf jahaan iesas puure iraq par apni pakad lagaataar majboot kar rahaa he, vahiin america samet sanyukt raashtra sangh or kai mitra deshon ne vahaan ke nae halaat par apane phikr kaa izhaar kiya he
 Now there are only two paths in front of the whole world
 In fact, this terrorist organization named Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, which along with many other countries including Iraq has woven the dream of a new Islamic country, goes through the bloodshed of millions of innocents
 And now it has begun with the occupation of three cities of Iraq
 aise main puri duniya ke saamne ab do hi raste hai
 To top it is to watch ISIS arbitrarily or else to siege them in Iraq to stop ISIS
 or ab tak america raashtrapati baraak obama ne jo sanket die hai, wo duusare vikalp kii taraf hi ishaara karte hai
 In fact, Obama has spoken of considering options to confront ISIS
 or unki is tippanee main iraq ke aanevaale dinon kii takadir chuphi he
 The situation is that after Obama's statement, the White House spokesperson has also put forward his talk
 ek taraf jahaan white house ne kaha he ki america sarkaar iraq main vidrohiyon par hawaii hamale kar sakati he, vahiin sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kaa kahana he ki yuan aatankwaad ke khilaaf iraq kii ladaai main vahaan kii sarkaar or janata ke saath he
 In such a situation, the situation of confrontation cannot be ruled out
 sabase zyaada nuksaan aam logon koiraq main haalat lagaataar bad se badtar ho rahe hai
 After the capture of Faluja, Tikrit and Mosul, terrorists have now started moving towards Baghdad, the capital of Iraq
 or durbhaagya se ye wo ilaake hai, jahaan rahanevaali sabase badi aabaadi se ye aatankwaadi nafrat karte hai
 To combat these terrorists from above, the Iraqi army has forced an airstrike in its own country
 or in sabamein sabase zyaada nuksaan aam logon kaa hi ho rahaa he
 Occupying the oil city of Kirkuk, the condition is that another faction in the north of Iraq, Kurdish forces have already captured the oil city of Kirkuk
 unka daawa he ki sarkari faujen vahaan se bhaag gai hai
 While the scope of ISIS is continuously increasing
 aise main jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki agar is tarah tel utpaadan ke thikaanon par vidrohiyon kaa kabja badhata rahaa to aanevane dinon ne naa sirf kachche tel kii qimaton main aag lag jaaegi, balki isaki aanch iraq se dur duniya ke tamaam duusare deshon tak bhi zarur pahonchegi
 As of now, the Loksabha Elections are still late, but West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has made a prediction for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) where the Center a good performance is essential for any party hoping to hold power
 bijepi (BJP) ko lekar mamata banerjee ne NDTV ke pranay roy se kaha ki "vah haar rahi he" or usko rajya kii 80 main se 17 siten bhi nahin milengi
 He said that "congress" will get seven to eight seats and Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav's performance will be excellent
 ''san 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ne sabase adhik siton vaale rajya uttarapradesh main 70 siten jiti thim or uske sahyogi apana dal ne do siten hasil kii thim
 This easily gave the BJP a majority in the Lok Sabha
 teen dashakon main yah pehla mauka tha jab kisi ek party ko purna bahumat hasil hua tha
 Mamata Banerjee said that there is a lot of cohesion between the regional parties, and their negotiations for further plans are moving forward
 pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) dwaara vipaksh ko "khichdi" kahe jane ke bare main puche jane par, unhone sawaal kiya ki 'khichdi banane main kya galat he? aapke paas chaaval, daal yaa aalu kii sabji bhi ho sakati he, ise khichdi main ek saath rakhaa jaataa he
 "don't speak your language," said Mamata Banerjee, accusing Prime Minister Modi of lowering the level of political speech
 unhen pataa hona chahie ki ve piem hai or jab ve baat kar rahe hai, to log sun rahe hai
 Political speech is also a part of culture
 ek gunde ko main gunda hi kahuungi, lekin main is tarah kii baat nahin karti
 When Mamata Banerjee was asked to assess PM Modi compared to other Prime Ministers, she said "I cannot rate her
" 
 
 ve fasivadi se bhi badtar ho gaye hai
 "he said that" what they are doing in Bengal is more than an emergency
 ve sab kuch chalaa rahe hai
 All officers are under the Election Commission
 "mukhyamantri mamata (mamata Banerjee) ne kaha ki bijepi samanaantar sarkaar chalaa rahi he or har jagah ve baari paisa kharch kar rahe hai
 Mamta had recently alleged that the Election Commission had ordered the transfer of four police officers at the behest of the ruling BJP at the Center
 ayog ne is aarope ko khaarij kar diya tha or kaha tha ki uskaa nirnay uske ek varisht adhikari or vishesh police paryvekshak se mili feedback par aadhaarit tha
 The Commission had also told Mamata Banerjee that according to election law, she has her own rights to transfer and appoint officers during the model code under which she is working

 PM Modi has claimed that 40 mlas of Mamta are in touch with him and will leave Mamata as soon as the results of Lok Sabha elections are declared

 Nitish Kumar's statement on NRC has the opposition Dalit Kumar has always had a double-character action: Opposition parties are in awe with JDU National President Nitish Kumar's statement regarding RJD National Citizen Register (NRC)
 haal tak jediu ke pravaktaa bihar main enarasi lagu nahin hone kaa bayaan dete rahe hai, lekin ab nitish kumaar ne kaha ki is par party ke andar vichaar vimarsh chal rahaa he
 The party will reach a conclusion only after that the stand will be cleared
 bihar vidhansabha main enarasi par jediu or khaskar nitish kumaar ke stand ko lekar jabardast hangaamaa hua tha
 Now opposition parties believe that Nitish Kumar is in a mood to compromise
 'nitish kumaar kaa doharaa charitra vaala ection'argedy ke pravaktaa or vidhayak ramanujaka kahana he, 'nitish kumaar kaa hameshaa dohare charitra vaala ection rahaa he, wo bolte kuch or karte kuch hai, kursi ke liye compromij karte rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar had said that under no circumstances, we will not accept issues like 370, triple talaq which have not been in our Common Minimum Program, but they all accepted them
 'unhone kaha, 'enarasi ko lekar iff bat yah inkaa pintara baaji he
 i will use the word maneuver in it, otherwise it will be opinionated
 koun he inke dal main is vishay par bolne vaala, yah bilkul sarender hai
 The Modi effect is applicable to them
 nishchit taur par yah log pehle virodh karte rahe hai phir samarthan karte rahe hai
 Nitish ji has been surrendering on every issue, this chair is Kumar, he will compromise for the chair in any way
 ''naa samarthan naa mukhaalafat, raishumaari karenge'congress ke shakeel ahamed khan kaa kaha, 'asal main nitish kumaar or janata dal you puri party virodhabhas or contradiction se guzar rahi he
 First they oppose NRC and then there Sitaram Sattaram, but the question is that you have to keep cleanliness
 bijepi ne jo janata dal you ke saath treetment kiya he, vah ibaadat inako padhani nahin chahie, abhi bhi vah naa samarthan kii baat kar rahe hai naa mukhaalafat kii baat kar rahe hai, raishumaari karenge
 'it is worth mentioning that BJP has been continuously talking about implementing NRC in Bihar, in such a situation, after Nitish Kumar's statement, NRC is still being talked about in the party
 vipakshi dalon ko saaf lagata he ki wo is mudde par bhi tripal talaak or dhara 370 jaise maamle kii tarah kii isko bhi anjaam tak pahunchaayenge
 In the case of section 370, JDU has already clarified that if law has been made in this case, then it will have to be followed
 agar enarasi par bhi centre sarkaar kanoon kaa muhar lagaati he to phir bihar sarkaar ko bhi maananaa padegaa

 The by-election in March 2018 can be considered as the biggest setback for the BJP, as the BJP lost the seats that were considered to be its stronghold
 
 
 yahi upachunaav vipaksh ke liye bhi bahut bada sabak banakar saamne aae, kyonki isamen do dhur-virdohi dalon ne ek saath aakar BJP ko vahaan patkhni di, jahaan unhen haraana lagbhag naammumkin mana jaataa rahaa tha
 
 
 For this by-election, there was an impossible alliance between Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh

 Towards the end of the year, the BJP suffered another setback when by-elections were held in three Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka in November, and the BJP lost one seat in its possession
 
 
 bellari seat par BJP se saansad rahe shriramulu ne rajya vidhansabha chunaav jeetne ke baad loksabhaa se istipha de diya tha, so, yahaan upachunaav karwaae gaye, lekin rajya main sattashin jds-congress gathbandhan ko barkaraar rakhte hue JDS ne yah seat congress ke liye chhod di, or vies ugarappa ne BJP kii je
 Defeated Shanta
 
 
 iske alaava rajya kii donon loksabhaa siton par jin partiyon ko kabza tha, vah barkaraar rahaa
 
 
 jds's own LR Shivramegowda won the seat vacated by JDS MP CS Puttaraju from Mandya as a minister in the state government
 siddharmaiya ko teen lakh se bhi zyaada voton ke antar se haraaya, jabaki shimoga seat purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa ke vidhansabha main pahunch jane kii vajah se rikt hui, or upachunaav main unke putr biwai raghavendra ne congress ke eches shanthavirappa ko haraakar party kaa kabza banaae rakhaa
 
 
 So, overall, the BJP lost more than half of the seats in this passing year, and the claim of 'modi wave' seemed to have faded
 
 
 iske alaava centre main sattarudh gathbandhan NDA ke liye musiibat or bad jaaegi, agar loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main bhi vipaksh ne in upachunaav-sareekha koi mahagathbandhan taiyaar kar liya

 The JD (U), which disagreed with Modi, did not pay much heed to this decision to increase his stature, insisting that the nda's prime ministerial candidate would be decided by all the constituents of the alliance
 jad(you) adhyaksh sharad yadav ne chennai se kaha, ‘bhaajapa ne jo faisla liya he, vah uskaa andruni maamla he
 He has to decide who makes him the president of the party or the chairman of a particular committee of the party

 He told that after the announcement of its candidate by the BJP, a decision will be taken on the NDA candidate for the post of Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri pad ke liye bhaajapa ke ummidavaar ke taur par modi ke naam par jari apni aapatti kaa sanket dete hue yadav ne kaha, ‘bhaajapa pehle pradhanmantri pad ke apane ummidavaar par faisla karegi or tab yah rajg ke samaksh laayaa jayega

 Akali Dal leader Sukhbir Singh Badal said, "the people of the country are looking towards the National Democratic Alliance to save the country from the clutches of the UPA government

 ' bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaarane guuruuvaar ko kaha ki panchayat raaj evam nagar nikaayon ke pratinidhiyon ko varsh 2008 se milane vaale har prakaar ke bhatte ko ek april 2013 se doguna kiya jayega
 Nitish announced this while presenting a vote of thanks on behalf of the government in the Bihar Legislative Council following the debate on the Governor's address given on February 18 during the joint session of the Bihar Legislature
 unhone kaha ki madrasa or sanskrit vidyalayon ke shikshak or shikshakettar karmiyon ko chathe vetanman ke mul vetan ke upar ek nirdisht manhagaai bhatta dene ke prastaav par ham gaur kar rahe hai, is sambandh main antim nirnay liya jayega
 Nitish said that the government is considering a proposal to acquire selected schools in a systematic way for tribal and inaccessible areas and the disadvantaged sections
 panchayat or nagar nikaayon main anubandh par behaal evam niyat vetan par behaal shikshakon ke bare main mukhyamantri ne kaha ki ve sarkari karmchaaree nahin hai, balki sanvaidhanik sansthaaon, panchayat or nagar nikaayon dwaara behaal kiye gaye hai
 He said that the government had amended Niyamwali to increase his fixed salary twice in 2010 and a provision for increase in his salary has been added every year
 bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane ke liye yojit jila sammelan ke dauraan jansabhaon main vibhinn sthanon par in shikshakon ke pradarshan kii charchaa karte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha ki jin shikshakon kii bahaali ke liye ham sari duniya main badanaami jhelte rahe vahi is tarah kii baat or vyavhaar kar rahe hai
 Nitish, without naming his fierce RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, took a sarcasm at his statement in which he first talked about the confirmation of these teachers when they came to power
 nitish ne kaha ki niyam bana hua he, aise main pehle din unka ve sthayeekaran kaise kar sakenge kyonki iske liye pehle purv kii niamvali ko nirast karnaa or nayi niamvali banani hogi tathaa bajet kaa upbandh karnaa hoga
 Nitish said that during his previous tenure, people were saying that these teachers were disqualified, saying that they would first remove everyone with a pen as soon as they came to power
 unhone kaha ki ye vahi log hai jo chunaav ayog ko patr likhakar in shikshakon ko chunaav duty main nahin lagaae jane kaa anurodh kiya tha or aaj unhen hi bhadkaa rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar, while accusing the opposition of being engaged in impractical tasks, said that the teachers, who were restored on contract and fixed salary, also know that they are their best
 kal vetan badhayenge to ham log hi badhayenge koi doosraa nahin badhayega
 He said that the opposition will harm the teachers by provoking them
 ham gusse main aakar do-chaar baat bol sakate hai lekin kisi kaa ahit nahin karenge
 If we do, we will only benefit them but do not provoke them
 nitish ne kaha ki hamane yah kabhi nahin kaha ki shikshakon kaa vetan nahin badhayenge
 We are reviewing it, whatever will be possible

 After all, what else can be understood on November 25 at the Hyatt Hotel in Mumbai
 shivasena ke 56 vidhayakon ne apane adhyaksh uddhav thakare ke alaava rashtravaadi congress party (rakanpa) pramukh sharad pavaar or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke prati nishtha kii shapath lee
 Until a month ago, Shiv Sena politics revolved around fierce protests against the NCP and Congress, and often reached personal commentary on the heads of these parties
 aise main tivi par dikhaa yah avishwasaneey ghatnakram yakeenan maharashtra kii raajnneeti ke puraane mahabali pavaar ke rajnatik kaushal, lagan or netwarking kaa hi kamaal tha
 Before the Maharashtra assembly elections on October 21, seven NCP mlas had joined Shiv Sena and BJP
 tab 6 aktubar ko india today ke saath baatcheet main 79 varshiya pavaar ne kaha tha, ''yah mere liye yuva netaaon ke saath party ke punarnirmaan kaa acha avasar he
 "ncp's morale was down and many of Pawar's friends were reluctant to give money to the party in this difficult time
 isse halaat kuch kathin hi hue ki bhaajapa ne, khaskar mukhyamantri devendra fadavis 'me punha ye (main phir aauungaa)' ke naare se chunavi phija taiyaar kii
 On 8 October, Pawar started a statewide tour
 unhone agle das din tak 57 reliyon ko sambodhit kiya or har din ausatan 300 kimi kii yatra kii
 His style on the stage had changed — body language was new and speeches had become sharp and sharp
 ek sabha main, pavaar ne kaha ki kya rakanpa ko chhodkar jo log gaye, unhone 15 saal tak satta main rahete hue chudibhan pahan rakhi thim
 In Satara, pictures of him addressing the crowd in the rain were printed
 ek anya raily main, ise bataane ke liye ki pratidwandvi partiyon main unase muqabla karne kaa dam nahin he, unhone ek hijde kii nakal utaari thi
 He said, “aata hai mala shikavanar (they have gone to teach me)
 ''pavaar ke rajyavyapee daure ne chunaav prachaar ko dhar di or unhen phir maharashtra kii raajnneeti ke centre main laa khadaa kiya
 The vigor in Pawar and NCP also increased with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filing a case in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank scam
 unhone 25 sitambar ko ek press conference bulaai or ghoshnaa kii ki ve do din baad khud idi ke saamne pesh honge
 Invoking Maratha pride, he compared the Narendra Modi government to the Mughal Sultanate and vowed to "not kneel before the Delhi court"
 baad main, pavaar ne twit kiya ki vah idi dakratar akele jaaenge
 This was an indirect message to his supporters to gather there
 mumbai ke varisht police adhikariyon ne pavaar se anurodh kiya ki ve mumbai ke idi karyaalay na aaen kyonki isse kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya paidaa ho sakati he
 Then a BJP MP from Maharashtra said about the ED summons, "our party has given a new life to Sharad Pawar
 yah aage baari padegaa
 The Maharashtra assembly election results made it clear that Pawar not only overcame obstacles but turned them into opportunities for himself and became politically strong
 is vidhansabha chunaav main rakanpa ne 54 siten jeetin, 2014 ke mukaable 13 zyada
 On the other hand, the party contested only 117 seats this time as compared to 250 in 2014
 rakanpa kaa vot vot pratishat duusare number par rahaa
 This was a sign of Pawar's strike rate and support for his election campaign
 congress ko maharashtra vikaas aghadi (emvie) gathbandhan ke tahat shivasena ke netritv vaali sarkaar main shaamil hone ke liye raji karnaa bhi pavaar ke liye badi chunauti thi
 There were many hurdles: Sonia's distrust of Pawar, confusion about the alliance with the Hindutva Party and the need for an acceptable formula for sharing power
 congress ke kuch netaa sashankit the ki gathbandhan uttar bharat main—khaskar bihar, uttar pradesh or dilli main party ko nuksaan pahunchayegaa kyonki shivasena ko pravasi virdohi party ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 "it is a big mistake," says a Congress general secretary on condition of anonymity
 rakanpa ke paas khone ko bahut kuch nahin he, lekin ham apane matadaataaon se kya kahenge? ham bhaajapa se kaise alag hai? yah (gathbandhan) hamaari pichhali rajnatik saakh ko gira chukaa he
 Many Congressmen, including a senior Muslim leader, advised Sonia to accept Pawar, who was willing to negotiate with the Shiv Sena to give the Congress a fair share in the power partnership
 sonia congress kii maharashtra ikai dwaara party chalaane ke liye fund kii ghor kami bataae jane ke kaaran bhi jhukin kyonki satta se paanch saal dur rahane se fund kii kami rajya main party kaa safaya kar sakati thi
 a Congress leader says that despite all these things, Sonia and her team kept the pace of this negotiation slow because there was so much to be at stake with this deal
 iske alaava, karnataka main gathbandhan ke anubhav ko dekhte hue bhi, party ek or 'asahaj' sahyogi se nipatane ko lekar saavdhaan mudra main thi
 The long-drawn-out discussions with Pawar gave the BJP an opportunity to sway NCP leader Ajit Pawar
 rakanpa ke ek andruni sutara kaa kahana he ki sharad pavaar bhattije ajit pavaar ke vidroh se hill gaye the
 Ajit was sworn in as a deputy to Devendra Fadnavis in the surprise swearing-in of the bjp-led government early in the morning on 23 November
 pavaar ko is kadam ke bare main tab pataa chalaa jab rakanpa ke vidhayak rajendra shingane ne unhen subah 6 baje phone kiya or bataaya ki ve ajit ke saath rajbhavan ja rahe hai
 Pawar entrusted the responsibility of persuading 15 rebels to return to the party to senior party leaders Jayant Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal and Dilip valse-patil
 or ajit ko rakanpa vidhayak dal ke netaa pad se hataa diya
 Rumors began to erupt in social media that Ajit himself was sent by Sharad Pawar to the BJP
 pavaar shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare or congress ke pradesh adhyaksh balasaheb thoraat ke saath milakar sthiti ko sanbhaalane main jute gaye
 They managed to locate all the NCP rebels and were kept in a five-star hotel in Bandra
 yahi nahin, pavaar ne vikaas aghadi ke sabhi vidhayakon ko shapath lene ke liye bhi kaha ki ve apni party ke prati vafaadaar rahenge, jo kuch asaamaanya-si ghatana thi
 "pawar made the impossible possible," says Nawab Malik, ncp's Mumbai president
 pavaar ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve aashwast karenge ki koi bhi vidhayak ayogy na ghoshit ho or sthiti niyantran main aa gai
 Of course only a master strategist could show this by doing this
 ''ye atakalein bhi hai ki pavaar shivasena se apni party ke liye bhi mukhyamantri pad kii khatir barabari kaa daawa kar sakate the to phir puure paanch saal ke liye mukhyamantri kaa pad shivasena ko saunpane ke liye kyon raji ho gaye? rakanpa ke ek netaa kaa kahana he ki pavaar gachhabandhan sarkaar main grih, vitt or jal sansaadhan jaise mahatvapurn mantralay hasil karnaa chaahate hai, isliye aisa kiya he
 The leader reminds that Pawar gave up his claim to the post of Chief Minister in 2004 as well, while NCP won two seats (71) more than the Congress
 17 november ko pune main rakanpa kii baithak main, pavaar ke kareebi sahyogi prafull patel, sunil tatakare or dhananjay munde ne bhaajapa kaa samarthan karne ke ajit ke vichaar kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Perhaps, Pawar rejected the suggestion of the party leaders because of his vision of the future of his party and the politics of the country
 sahyogi dalon ko lekar bhaajapa kaa record utsahjanak nahin rahaa he
 As the Congress leadership is struggling with the crisis and opposition leaders like Mamata Banerjee, Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav are struggling to keep their ground, Pawar has given Maharashtra's political crisis an opportunity to emerge as such an opposition leader
 i have seen, who can beat the Narendra modi-amit Shah duo in their own game
 do sabase asangat sahyogiyon ko ek saath laakar, ve bhaajapa virdohi takaton ko ekajute karne ke ek nae ranneetikaar ke rup main sthapit hue hai
 There is no doubt that the savior who was looking for a frustrated, frustrated opposition probably fulfills his quest as Pawar

 "chidambaram ne twitor par kaha ki sarkaar 'wyk' patrika ke aaropon kaa jawaab dene or multi agency centre kii bhoomika kaa khulaasa karne ke liye baadhya he

 He was accompanied by UP Police personnel
 phir police us shaks ko lekar ek khet main daakhil ho gai
 Where a long excavation was done at a particular place
 khudaai se dhire-dhire gaddha gaharaa hota ja rahaa tha
 And then a corpse buried in the pits appeared in front of everyone
 jarur padhein teen saal tak apni bivi kii kabr par naachata rahaa ye aadmigaanv main pahunchi dilli policejise dekhakar gaanv waalon ke pairon tale se jameen khis gai
 Actually, the dead body was of a person named Faheemuddin living in the Welcome area of delhi
 or jis aaropee kii nishandehi par laash ko baahar nikaala gaya us shaks kaa naam he safal
 The police was arrested and brought here
 safal ne kaam kaa paisa nahin diyadilli ke north east jile kii police ke shikanje aane ke baad aaropee safal ne hi fahimuddin kii maut kaa raaj kholaa
 Actually, Fahimuddin used to work as a clay filler
 usne safal ke liye mitti bharaav kaa kaam kiya tha
 But successful did not give him the money for this work
 safal ek saal tak fahimuddin ko paise ke liye taalata rahaa
 The recent conspiracy to kill for five thousand gave Fahimuddin a new job and also gave an advance of five thousand rupees
 magar abhi tak safal par fahimuddin ke pehle paanch hajaar bakaayaa the
 So he did not start work
 bas yahi baat safal ko nagavar gujri or phir usne rachi fahimuddin ke katl kii khaufnak sajeesh
 Must Read: Know that the dreaded accused of the International Kidney racket in Delhi had gone to Fahimuddin's house, DCP Ajit Singhala of North East Delhi told that the successful also involved his maternal uncle's son Deepak in the plot of this murder
 unke mutabik sajeesh ke tahat 28 june kii subah safal khud fahimuddin ke ghar pahunchaa or fahimuddin kii patni ke mobile se fahimuddin ko phone karke paise dene ke liye apane paas bulaayaa
 Fahimuddin had gone missing since then
 jamkar kii pityeefahimuddin jab safal ke ghar pahunchaa to vahaan safal or deepak ne milakar uski jamkar pitayee kii
 He kept on begging for mercy from both of them but both of them did not stop
 thodi der baad pitayee kii vajah se fahimuddin behosh ho gaya
 According to the police, successful and Deepak thought him dead
 tivi sho dekhakar rachi hatya kii sajishaun donon laash ko thikaane lagane or police se bachane kii yojana banaai
 Whose idea came by watching a TV show
 sabase pehle unhone behosh fahimuddin ko laash samajhakar ek bore main band kar diya
 And then put it in his Alto car
 kisi ko shaq naa ho iske liye car par cover daal diya gaya
 Read here: The police officer had hatched the greed of hundred crores to kidnap Fahimuddin in the village of Hahapud, when he was buried alive and reached Rampur village in Hapur, UP
 vahaan ek khet main gaddha khodakar fahimuddin ko dafna diya
 But according to the police, Fahimuddin was alive by that time
 jiske mutabik fahimuddin ko safal or deepak ne saath milakar jinda hi jameen main gadh diya tha
 After arresting himself, both of them also threw away Fahimuddin's bike
 yahaan tak ki uske kapadon bhi kahin thikaane laga diya
 After this, successful and Deepak, according to their plan, arrested themselves from the Pilkhua police under the Arms Act so that the police would not suspect them in the case of Faheemuddin's murder
 aise khulaa maamlidhar fahimuddin ke ghar vaale uski talash karte hue welcome police ke paas pahunch gaye or shikaayat darj karai
 Seven police teams were involved in the search for Faheemuddin
 is dauraan gharavaalon ne welcome thane ke baahar pradarshan bhi kiya
 The family members told the police that Faheemuddin was summoned to his house by a successful man
 police ne safal ke bare main pataa kiya to pataa chalaa ki safal apane saathi deepak ke saath gajiabad kii dasna jail main band he
 But when the police went to Dasna jail and questioned Sukha, the shocking secret was revealed to everyone
 police ne is maamle main safal or deepak samet teen logon ko giraftaar kiya he jabik laash thikaane lagane ke maamle main teen log abhi bhi faraar hai
 Police is searching for them

 com / qqv78vd8ip koi badmaash kisi ko agava karne se pehle baqayada use daavat dekar bulaae or apane paas aane ke liye air tikat tak bhijwa de, kya aisa bhi kabhi hota he? lekin dilli se lekar patna tak faili kidnaping kii ye kahani kuch aisi hi he
 In this strange incident, the kidnappers first told their victim about a business deal worth 200 crores and then sent a flight ticket for it but as soon as two brothers reached Patna to do the deal, they were kidnapped from the airport
 kidanapers ke changul se aaazaad hone ke baad ye donon ab beshak jaan kii khayr manaa rahe hai lekin ab se chand ghante pehle tak in donon bhaaiyon ko ye pataa bhi nahin tha ki wo jinda bachenge bhi yaa nahin
 In fact, these two businessmen of Delhi had gone to the hands of a gang of kidnappers spread from Delhi to Patna, who used to kidnap people and recover them by cheating crores of deals
 lekin is baar in badmaashon ke liye baaji ulti pad gai
 More than a hundred policemen launched such an operation against the kidnappers inside the ten-kilometer dense forests for ten hours that not only the two brothers were safely recovered, but also five gang miscreants were arrested
 kidanapers ne bhijwaya tha air tiktadilli ke badarpur main rahane vaale in donon thekedaar bhaaiyon ko ek roj marble kaa kaam dilaane ke naam par kisi gumnaam shaks kaa phone aata he
 The caller tells that this work of marble is worth two hundred crores but it is very important for them to come to Patna once before visiting the site before finalizing the deal
 jaahir he deal to badi he hi, phone karne vaala shaks kaam main apana rujhaan dikhaate hue unhen patna tak kaa air tikat bhi dene kii baat kahata he or agle chand ghanton main ek travel agent in donon kaarobaari bhaaiyon ke ghar ke ghar patna kii flite kaa tikat pahunchaa detaa he
 In film style, Agwadilli's IGI Airport as soon as the Go Air flight arrives at Patna's Jayaprakash Narayan Airport, the two brothers are abducted in filmy style
 haalanki tab bhi donon ko khud ke agava ho jane kaa shaq nahin hota kyonki agava karne vaale baqayada unase phone par baat karte hue airport par gaadi bhijwane or vahaan se hotel tak pahunchane kaa jhansa dete hai lekin ek baar gaadi main baithte in donon bhaaiyon ke saath jo kuch hota he, wo unke liye khwaabon se bhi pare he
 The policemen take away their hands and walk away, and the people present in the vehicle take both of them hostage on the basis of weapons and tell that now the value of their release is full 4 crores
 donon kaarobaari bhaaiyon ke apharan kii khabar jab patna police tak pahunchi, to vardiwaalon ke bhi haath paanv phool gaye
 The case was as high-profile as it was, because the miscreants had invited their victims to Bihar for a feast and then more than a hundred policemen started Operation Kidnapping
 parivaar ne lee police kii madadudhar, kidnaping ke baad dilli main jaise hi in donon bhaaiyon ke gharavaalon ko rihaai ke liye 4 karod rupye kii phiroti chukaane kii kol ai, puure parivaar ke haath-paanv phool gaye
 The question was about the lives of two young sons, but the amount of ransom was so big that even after thinking everyone was sweating
 aise main gharavaalon ne police kii madad lene kaa faisla kiya
 In search of his two sons Suresh and Kapil, his father Babulal Sharma ran to Patna and he wrote a report at the airport station there
 jaanch ke liye banaai gai timalekin jab police ne kidnaping kii kahani or donon ladakon ko agava kiye jane kaa tarika suna, to uske bhi kaan khadey ho gaye
 The case was very strange
 jahaan kidanapers ne apane shikaar ko do sau karod rupye kii deal karwaane kii baat kah kar baqayada air tikat dekar bulaayaa tha or phir kidanap kar liya tha
 Immediately, the police spread the trap of their informers all over Bihar
 puraane badmaashon par najar rakhi jane lagi
 Along with this, the location of the two brothers on mobile phone surveillance started to find out their location and special operations group, police of two districts, anti-extortion team and CRPF were also involved in this work
 police ne pakadi lokeshnaiske baad ek-ek kar kai roj guzar gaye or aakhirkaar wo vakt bhi aayaa, jab khufia ittila or technical servilans kii badaulat agava kiye gaye bhaaiyon kaa lokation pataa chal gaya
 And this location was from the forest of Sringirishi area of lakhisarai district, a few kilometers from Patna
 lekin ye jangal jitna ghanaa tha, naksaliyon kii maujuudagi ke chalate yahaan janaa utana hi khatarnaak lekin agar dilli ke in do bhaaiyon ko aaazaad karwaanaa tha, to police ke liye yahaan janaa bhi behad jaruri tha
 And then there was preparation to attack in this forest overnight
 police bada lavaajama 10 kilometre lambey raaston se hota hua jangal ke andar thik us jagah par pahunchaa, jahaan agava kiye gaye donon bhaaiyon ko bandhak bana kar rakhaa gaya tha or phir hua ek aisa opeshan jisane puri kahani palat di
 Police found out the whereabouts of the brothers More than a hundred policemen, divided into eight teams, searched through the forests of Lakhisarai in the darkness for the whole ten hours
 ek aisa jangal jisamen jitna khatra junglee jaanwaron kaa tha, utana hi naksaliyon or kadam-kadam par bichhe land mins kaa bhi
 But in spite of this the police finally reached the hideout, where the two brothers who were abducted from Delhi were kept and then there was so much firing that the whole forest echoed in the darkness of night
 agava bhaaiyon ko kahin or le jane kii firaaq main the aaropiyaha tak kisi gaadi se pahunchane kaa koi rasta nahin tha, aise main patna ke esaspi manu maharaj kii aguwai main police kii alag-alag aath tiimon main bante sau se zyada logon ne paidal hi badmaashon ke adde tak pahunchane kaa faisla kiya
 The journey started through bumpy and wooded paths and when the police came very close to the miscreants, it was about eleven o'clock in the night
 yahaan police ne sahi maukey kaa intjaar kiya lekin tab tak badmaashon ko police ke pahunchane kii bhanak lag chuki thi or ab wo donon bhaaiyon ko ek baar phir se behosh kar jagah badalane kii taiyaari kar rahe the lekin ain maukey par police ne unhen gher liya
 After this, almost forty rounds of bullets were fired from both sides and finally after this ten-hour operation, the police got the two brothers free
 mastermind ke bare main jaanakar chaunk gaye sajaab police kaa mishan kaamyaab ho chukaa tha
 At the same time, five people were arrested one by one with some goons sitting holding the victims of kidnapping
 lekin is kahani ke mastermint ke chehre se nakaab hatana ab bhi baaki tha
 And then when the mask was removed, the people kept watching
 kyonki ye cheharaa tha bihar ke nami badmaash or apharan udyog kaa purana naam - ranjit mandal urf ranjit don
 In the same way, the kidnapping was done in the same way as the modus operandi of this gang of kidnappers who used to call their victims on the pretext of crores of business deals and giving them air tickets, gave the police an important clue about them
 kyonki kuch samay pehle haryana ke hi ek or kaarobaari ko bhi patna main kuch isi tareeke se agava kiya gaya tha or kidnaping ke is tareeke ke peeche haath tha bihar ke khoonkhaar gangster or jurm kii duniya ke puraane khilaadi ranjit mandal urf ranjit don kaa
 Bihar gangster is still absconding Yes, the same Ranjit don, who has more than two dozen cases in various states including Bihar ranging from rape to kidnapping and extortion to murder
 police ab ranjit ke thikaanon ke bare main bhi pataa laga chuki thi
 And in all ways, she finally reached the kidnapped brothers, but Ranjit, the mastermind of the case, is still absconding
 ranjit ke pakade jane kaa he intjarsutron kii maane to ranjit bihar ke apharan udyog kaa purana cheharaa he, jo isi tarah dhokhe se apane shikaar faansata he
 He recovers himself from them, sells the victim to other miscreants and with the same intention, he has been doing marble work in Delhi
 idhar, dilli police ne us travel agent ko bhi ab dhar dabocha he, jisane ranjit ke ishaare par thekedaar bhaaiyon ko flite kaa tikat bhi diya tha
 Obviously, the whole matter is now clear like a glass
 bas, police ko ranjit ke pakade jane kaa intjaar he
