 When Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was asked if he was ready to relinquish the captaincy after another Test series loss to foreign soil, he responded openly
 england ke khilaaf maujuuda shrunkhlaa main mili 1-3 kii karaari shikast ke baad jab unase poocha gaya ki kya vah test captaini chhodane ke bare main vichaar kar rahe hai to dhoni ne uttar diya, 'aapako yah pataa karne ke liye intjaar karnaa hoga ki main is shikast se ubarne ke liye majboot hum yaa nahin
 ' kya unhone bataur bhartiya test captain kaaphi kaam kiya he to dhoni ne ek pankti kaa jawaab diya, 'shaayad, haa
 "but his batsmen have failed in five consecutive innings, so they did not defend at all about the poor performance in the last three Tests
 dhoni ne teen din se bhi kam samay main khatm hue match ke baad kaha, 'yah ballebaaji kram kaa hi pratibimb he jisane acha pradarshan nahin kiya he
 ' unhone kaha, 'murali vijay ne acha kiya he, lekin pehle test se hi ham acchhee salaami saajhedaari nahin hasil kar paa rahe hai
 Cheteshwar Pujara had to get down early to play in the middle which was only in the third and fourth overs in each innings
 isse hamaara tisare number kaa ballebaaj jaldi utarataa rahaa or viraat kohli kharaab daur se gujara
 ' dhoni ne kaha ki jab team chah ballebaajon ke saath khelti he to lagaataar wicket ganvaane se mushkil ho jaati he
 He said, 'if you are playing with six batsmen, including the wicketkeeper, then if you lose many wickets quickly then it becomes a bit difficult
 jab nichle kram ne ran jutaaye to hamane 300 se zyada ran kaa score banaaya or ek baar ve saste main out ho gaye to ham board par ran jutaney main jujhate rahe
 ' dhoni ne kaha, 'haa, ham bahut niraash the ki ham antim teen test match main koi chunauti pesh nahin kar sake
 Hopefully batsmen will learn positive things from this defeat

 The question, however, is that the Indian team management did not take any lessons from the 2011 defeat in which they lost 0-4 to England here
 dhoni ne kaha, 'team tabaki team se puri tarah se badal gai he
 ' dhoni ne kaha, 'maine us shrunkhlaa se jo bhi ranneetiyaan sikhin thi, maine is shrunkhlaa main bhi unhen lagu karne kii koshish kii he
 When you try to change the field as a captain, you need to see the strength of the fast bowlers

 Vinod Rai, chairman of the Committee of Administrators of Indian cricket gave this information
 sarkaar ne somvaar ko jammu-kashmir ko do centreshasit pradeshon jammu-kashmir or ladakh main baanta

 The comments court ko kisi maamle kaa faisla karne main vakeelon kii daleel or bahes se hi madad milti he
 During the hearing, Justice Mishra asked the lawyer to do a research and report whether there has been any person in the world who has never faced criticism
 ye vyakti koi itihaas yaa puraana se judaa ho saktaa he
 Justice Mishra stated his own case when he was practicing in 1977 and in one case the judges were impressed by his arguments and allowed a half-an-hour debate
 unhone kaha ki cese kii sunwaayee hameshaa cese kii gambhirtha par hi nirbhar karti he

 The Supreme Court then refused to hear this petition

 akbar par dabaav itnaa bad gaya ki unka tike rahanaa mushkil ho gaya
 The biggest role in this pressure was that of the woman journalist Priya Ramani, on whom Akbar decided to file a defamation case, which made Ramani raise her voice

 Although some were found supporting Ramani
 kuch mahilaon ne unki ore se croudfnding (janasahyog) se rakam jutaney kii tarkeeb sochi he taaki kanoonee kharche vahan kiye ja saken
 Till the sudden resignation of Akbar, there seemed to be speculation in the BJP that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah were not ready to show Akbar the way out
 kuch log kehete hai ki unhen ashanka thi ki aisa karne se bhaanumati kaa pitara khul saktaa he jisase rajnatik virodhiyon ko betuke aarope lagane kii shah milegi
 Union ministers Maneka Gandhi and Smriti Irani were seen demanding an inquiry into the misconduct of Akbar, while some described it as a political conspiracy
 naam na chhapane kii shart par bhaajapa ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''congress ne sarkaar kii bedaag chhavi par keechad oochhaalane kii niyat se rafel mudde ko uthaane main apana puraa jor laga diya tha
 Now if Akbar is asked to step down on moral grounds, then a series of allegations can begin
 '' beshak, congress akbar prakaran ko ek avasar ke rup main dekhati he
 Which opposition party will not do so? Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, "modi's silence shows that the government's claim on women's dignity is hollow and the Modi government lacks commitment to the interests of women
" 'beti bachaao' mahaj ek naaraa bhar he
 "another spokesperson of the Congress, Shaktisinh Gohil, said," There is no existence of such thing as a moral basis for Modiji
 agar unhen lagegaa ki mantrimandal main akbar ke hone se unhen nuksaan ho rahaa he, bas tabhi vah koi karrwai karenge, anyathaa kuch nahin karne vaale
 "most such political dialogues were short-sighted and tricky
" lekin bharat main teji se jagajaahir ho rahe # mitu abhiyaan main kaarysthalon par purushon ke mahilaon se yon duvryavahar ke kisse peediton ne jagajaahir kiye hai
 BJP sources also indicate that Akbar had offered to resign but was advised to take legal action
 lekin baad main yah bhi kaanaafoosee hui ki shah chunavi samay main koi jokhim nahin uthaanaa chaahate
 Sushma Swaraj was also consulted

 kya bhaajapa akbar ke khilaaf aaropon par vishwaas karti he, is prashn ke uttar main unhone bas itnaa kaha ki akbar ne bhi ''apana paksh rakhaa he
 The BJP is unwilling to go into detail on the allegations, Ramani was the first to accuse Akbar of sexual harassment on social media
 uske baad hi kai mahila patrakaron ne akbar par aise hi aarope lagaae hai
 But how long will Akbar stop himself from investigating the allegations on his conduct? Their legal strategy is aggressive but the angle of 'political conspiracy' cannot be easily embraced because the tragedy that women have heard is many decades old
 bhaajapa sutara ishaara karte hai ki akbar ne istife kii peshkash kii thi lekin unhen kanoonee karrwai karne kii salaah di gaibaat pate kii''aam chunaavon se kuch hi maheene pehle yah tufaan kyon khadaa hua he
 Is there an agenda behind this? aap hi faisla karen

 If he had expected any regrets from Akbar, his obstinate refusal would have disappointed the people and their confusion would have gone away

 ’ Gambhir has played 48 Tests and 134 odis in his eight-year international career but still feels insecure about being dropped from the national team
 unhone kaha, ‘jahaan tak mere peshey kaa sawaal he to mujhe bahut asuraksha mahasoos hoti he

 All the emotions were stirring up inside me
 pehali naukari kii khushior nae maahaul main khud ko dhaalane kii jaldi donon hi thi
 Many times i used to get upset with this experiment
 aise hi ek din lunch ke dauraan main akele baitha tha
 Then i came across an uncle working in the office, who used to work as a peon here
 main unhen chachaa kahata tha kyonki adab main ham bado ko unke ohade se nahin umr dekhakar izzat dete hai
 Uncle a and said, 'why are you sitting alone son? Tell me if there is any problem
 
 
 ' main unase koi baat kahata tab tak unhone kaha, 'nae-nae aae ho, maahaul ke saath dhalane main thodaa vakt lagegaa
 'as soon as i heard this, i asked him a question that has been going on inside me for several days, is it important to change with the uncle? What can't we be like? To this he replied, "there is no harm in living the way we are, provided we give freedom to others too
" ' maine kaha main samajha nahin
 
 
 So he said, 'whatever is like it is tolerated

 Let both be like them, if someone feels good then definitely adopt it

 a girl from Indore comes to Delhi dreaming of becoming a successful journalist
 phir dilli ke kareeb hi faridabad main rah kar wo apane khwab ko pankh detii he
 She was working as a reporter in a web portal
 sab kuch thikthak chal rahaa tha lekin tabhi 1 may kii der raat jis paanchavin manzil par uskaa flats tha, usee paanchavin manzil se gir kar achaanak uski maut ho jaati he
 The investigation of death begins and then the police gaze on a line written four months before the death
 fasebuk par ye line usee ne likhi thi 'ek mashvira chahie
 
 
 
 khudakushi kar luun yaa ishk?' kareeb chaar maheene pehle 24 november 2015 ko puja tiwari ne apane fasebuk par ye sawaal poocha tha
 This question was just like this, or even if there was any meaning behind it
 magar chaar maheene baad puja kii maut or khaas kar jis tareeke se uski maut hui uske baad achaanak ye sawaal behad ahm ho gaya he
 But to understand the meaning of this question, it is necessary to understand the whole story first
 maut ke vakt flats main maujuud the dostpuja tiwari faridabad ke ek web portal main jarnlist thi or faridabad main hi isi apartment kii paanchavin manzil par kiraye ke flats main rahati thi
 He died due to a fall from the fifth floor of the same apartment last Sunday i
e
 late May 1
 jab puja paanchavin manzil se giri thi tab us vakt uske flats main uske do dost bhi maujuud the
 One Police Inspector Amit and the other Amreen
 puja kii maut ke fouran baad uske donon doston ne police ko yahi bataaya ki puja ne khud hi upar se chalaang lagaai thi kyonki wo police main darj apane khilaaf blakemeling ke ek cese ko lekar pareshaan thi
 The first aspect of the story was actually the web portal where Pooja worked, she did a story for the same portal
 ye story jholachhap doctoron or khaskar un doctoron ke khilaaf thi jo bhrun hatya main shaamil the
 In this connection, Pooja also did a sting with her friend
 magar baad main unheen main se ek doctor ne puja ke khilaaf police main report likhaa di ki wo usase do lakh rupye maang rahi he or blackmel kar rahi he
 Now since the case was registered with the police, the police also initially accepted that it is quite possible that Pooja may have committed suicide under this tension
 kahani main aayaa twistye tha kahani kaa ek pahalu magar is kahani main bas ek dikkat thi, or wo ye ki puja ke khilaaf blakemeling kaa maamla kaaphi din pehle darj hua tha
 If he gave his life only for that reason then why not write a suicide note? The police was still investigating the matter in this aspect only when some such things came to light which brought many new twist in the story of Pooja's death
 phone main mili kol kii recordingamout kaa ek sidhaa-saadhaa sa cese achaanak behad pechida ho gaya he
 Because a recording was found in Pooja's phone
 is ricardid baatcheet main kai aisi baaten hai jinamein puja kii maut kaa raaj chupa he
 And all these conversations happened just before Pooja's death
 is baatcheet se na sirf puja kii maut kaa sach pataa chal saktaa he balki uske us sawaal kaa jawaab bhi mil saktaa he jo usne fasebuk par chaar maheene pehle likhaa tha
 Actually on the night Pooja died that evening, Inspector Amit was with Pooja and was also with her before death
 shaam ko amit or puja flats ke paas hi kisi park main baithe the
 Amit was then sitting in the park drinking alcohol
 iske baad raat dedh baje tak inspector puja ke ghar main hi tha
 Even Pooja fell from the fifth floor when Amit's hand touched her
 puja kii phone par uske dost bharat se baat hui
 At this time Amit was also present with Pooja
 kol recording shaam 05
 12 to 05
 40 tak kii he
 What is in the recording? In this recording, this police inspector named Amit Vashishtha, who is told by Pooja's house his family friend and Pooja's local guardian, is talking to Pooja on how and on what issue
 sharaab ke nashe main dhutt ye local gargian bilkul pulisia andaaj main puja se wo sabakuch puch rahaa he, jo aamtaur par kisi kii nijee jindagi main badi ahm jagah rakhane vaala koi shaks hi puch saktaa he
 He is asking why Pooja went alone in the room with a boy named Banki and how long she did and what she did
 yahaan puja or amit ek saath hai, jabaki bharat naam kaa teesraa dost phone par he
 This in itself shows a glimpse of Amit's role in Pooja's life
 ittefaq se jis roj puja kii rahasyamayi halaat main paanchavin manzil se girakar maut hui, tab bhi amit vashishtha aadhi raat ko puja ke kamare main tha or in donon ne apni ek teesri friend amarine ke saath milakar us raat jamkar sharaab pi thi lekin isse pehle amit ne kaaphi hangaamaa kiya tha
 Despite being so much accused against Amit, but the Faridabad police is currently only considering Pooja's death as a suicide on the basis of the same statement of Amreen, in which Amreen has committed suicide for having committed a blackmailing case
 Has said haalanki jis doctor ne puja ke khilaaf blakemeling kii report darj karwaai thi or puja kii khudakushi ke baad jise faridabad police ne khudakushi ke liye majaboor karne kaa mulgim banaaya he, ab wo khulkar inspector amit vashishtha ke khilaaf aa gaya he
 Dr Anil Goyal said, 'amit's role is questionable
 wo raat dedh baje puja ke kamare main kya kar rahaa tha
 He may have pushed
 'amit ne sunai ye kahaniudhar, sawaalon ke ghere main aae amit ne puja kii khudakushi kii jo kahani sunai he, wo bhi apane-aap main behad ajeeb he
 Amit had believed that Pooja had been hanging from the balcony earlier that night and then she had also grabbed Pooja's hand, but left the hand and Pooja fell down from the fifth floor
 ab sawaal ye uthta he ki agar aadhi raat ko ye sab kuch chal rahaa tha, to usne puja kii jaan bachaane ke liye shor kyon nahin machaaya
 Why his third friend Amreen did not move from the second room to the balcony
 jaahir, us raat puja kii maut se pehle kaaphi kuch hua or amit der tak puja se rishton ko lekar hangaamaa bhi karata rahaa
 In such a situation, it is clear that the matter is being told as straightforward suicide
 shaadi kar chuke the amit or poojrub puja kii maut ke baad puja kii hi ek padosi saamne ai he or usne puja or amit ke rishton ko lekar kai chaunkaane vaale khulaase kiye hai
 This woman claims that Pooja and the inspector were married
 khud ko puja kii munhaboli bhabhi bataane vaali is mahila kaa naam usha he
 Usha says that Pooja was not only in love with Amit, but both of them got married too, but Amit always used to torture her
 use aksar buree tarah martha-peethta bhi tha
 Pujadar actually wanted to go abroad to give birth to a child, the place where Pooja used to live in a rented house in Faridabad is the Usha shop
 puja akasar usha ke dukaan main aayaa karti thi
 From here, both of them became friends
 iske baad puja usha ko bhabhi bulaane lagi
 According to Usha, Pooja used to tell her all her things
 bakaul usha puja ne hi kuch vakt pehle bataaya tha amit pehle se shaadishuda tha lekin ye baat usne usase chupa rakhi thi
 But later Pooja came to know the truth after which both of them had a fight
 usha ke mutabik puja pregnant bhi hui thi lekin amit ne uskaa aborshan karvaa diya
 In such a situation, Pooja wanted to go abroad and give birth to her child
 nahin bataane di gai sachaiusha kaa kahana he ki puja kii khudakushi ko lekar jo baaten kahi ja rahi he, wo juthi he
 Pooja was such a strong girl that she could not commit suicide
 usha ne kaha ki uske mobile main puja ne apni nijee tasviren bheji thi
 There were also pictures of his worship and Amit's wedding
 magar khud puja ke bhai ne wo sari tasviren mobile se delit kar deen
 Usha says that she wanted to tell Pooja's parents her truth, but Pooja's brother and Amit's people did not allow her to do so
 bahut majboot thi puujamaut se chand ghante pehle tak jo puja mumbai offis jaakar apane khilaaf darj blakemeling ke maamle main apana paksh rakhane kii baat kah rahi thi, usee ne thodi hi der baad paanchavin manzil se kud kar khudakushi kaise kar lee? ye ek bada sawaal he
 This question is also big because people who know Pooja say that she was not a weak girl but a very happy and strong girl
 desh kaa ek bada or nami jarnlist banane kaa sapana liye kuch saal pehle puja tiwari indore se dilli ai thi
 Worked in some newspapers, then got a job in the news portal of a big group just some time ago
 yaheen kaam karte hue usne jhola chhap doctoron par ek sting oparation bhi kiya lekin ye sting oparation uske liye bada sir dard sabit hua
 The doctors wrote a blackmailing report against him and Pooja was suspended
 lekin puja ko jaanane vaale logon kii maane to wo itani kamazor nahin thi ki mahaj itani si baat par khudakushi kar leti
 Because Pooja shared her plan to go to the Mumbai office of the portal, to talk about it with a friend even before her suicide
 aise main wo kuch der baad khudakushi kar legi, ye sochna bhi mushkil he
 But shortly afterwards he died under mysterious circumstances
 puja fasebuk par kaaphi active thi or aksar apni tasviren aplod kiya karti thi lekin hairaani kii baat ye he ki puja jis inspector amit ke itane kareeb thi, usne uski koi tasviir kabhi fasebuk par nahin daali
 By the way, when Pooja's mouth said, Amit always wanted to keep his and Pooja's relationship hidden
 or baad ke dinon main jab ye raaj khul gaya, to wo puja ko sadbhaavna apartment le gaya

 All are quiet in the ruling NDA in Bihar but everything is unusual
 aisa pichley ek hafte ke dauraan bhaajapa ke netaaon khaaskar kendriya mantri giriraaj singh dwaara jalajmav ke bahaane mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko 'pani -pani' karne ke uddeshy se jo har din bayanon or twit kaa daur chalaa tha vah bhaajapa ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda ke hastkshep ke baad filhal tham gaya he
 But the leaders of both the parties believe that not everything is normal due to which there is confusion among the workers
 haalanki aane vaale din main rishte main tanaav or ek asamanjas kii is sthiti kaa ek loksabhaa seat or paanch vidhaan sabha seat ke prachaar par shaayad iskaa asar naa pade or kishanganj vidhansabha seat ko chhodkar sabhi siten endie apane qabze main rakhane main kaamyaab ho
 But now there is no doubt about some things in both the parties, but what is at the root of this dispute is still being discussed
 patna ke jalajmav se ek baat saaf hai ki bihar bhaajapa main ab do gut hai ek up mukhyamantri susheel modi kaa or doosraa giriraaj kaa
 Where Patna's floods and waterlogging are questioning Modi's administrative efficiency
 vahiin tejasvi yadav or susheel modi or bijepi vidhayak jab raahat or bachaav kaary se dur rahe to usee bich purv saansad pappu yadav janata main koob vaah wahi batori
 If Giriraj Singh is speaking on every issue by targeting Nitish Kumar, then the party leadership is also fueled by him, no one is confused about this in the Janata Dal United (JDU)
 lekin jediu netaaon kaa bhi vyavhaar, khaaskar grahamantri amit shah ko lekar vah bhi lakshmana rekha ko langhane ke samaan he
 In this context, when the NRC report came last month, the tweet of JDU National Vice President Prashant Kishore was also different from Amit Shah's stand
 vaise hi unka mamata banerjee ke liye apane company ke madhyam se kaam karnaa bijepi ko pasand nahi he
 However, it may be a matter of achievement for Prashant Kishore that after a few months of work in Bengal, BJP is beginning to see its impact
 vaise hi party ke ek or pravaktaa pawan verma dwaara bhaajapa ke aalochana main akhbaar main unke lekhon se bhi bijepi kush nahin he
 It is also true that after the aggressive role of Prashant Kishor during the election of Patna University Students Union last year and raiding till the abvp's office, all senior leaders of Bihar BJP met Nitish and protested after which Prashant Kishore was given to Nitish From preparation for Lok Sabha elections to campaigning, kept completely aside
 unki sakriyata loksabhaa chunaav ke baad us samay badi jab sarkaar ke gathan main nitish kumaar ke formula ke tahat pratinidhitiv ko modi or shah ne maanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Apart from this, the central leadership of BJP also did not like speeches against Chief Minister Raghubar Das under the leadership of Nitish Kumar in Jharkhand
 haalanki janata dal united ke netaaon kaa kahana hai ki bijepi bhul jaati he ki nitish kumaar ne unke aagrah par apana menifesto bhi loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan jari nahin kiya tha
 At the same time, he kept distance from the media that he would repeatedly talk to him about controversial issues and whatever his answer would be, every person would be interpreted according to their own and there was no confusion among the workers
 agar aaj BJP akramak he or nagar vikaas vibhaag patna nagar nigam main saalon se kabja hone ke baad bhi agar jal jamaav ke liye thikra mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par phod rahi he to wo bhi unki sochi samajhi ranneeti kaa hi hissaa he
 Janata Dal United leaders say they too have feedback
 jahaan samvidhan kii dhara 370 khatm karne ke baad desh ke anya bhaagon kii tarah bihar main bhi dhruvikaran badha he to ram mandir ke mudde par agar faisalaa paksh main aa jayega uske baad maahaul bijepi ke liye or anukool ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, the BJP will try to surround the Chief Minister despite being in the government by making every small issue a question of prestige
 haalanki BJP or janata dal united donon ke netaa yah bhi maanate hai ki is kheenchaatani kaa asal maqasad agle saal vidhansabha chunaav main siton ko lekar jo baatcheet honi he uske liye abhi se dabaav kii raajnneeti shuru ho gai he, jahaan BJP kaa kahana he ki jaisaa loksabhaa main pichhali baar do seat jeetne ke baavjood BJP ne nitish kumaar ko barabari se seat se bantwaaraa hua to to usee formule ke aadhaar par vidhansabha chunaavon ke liye donon dal barabari-barabari se siton par ladane ke liye sahamat hon

 At one time, the franchise was not showing much interest in him in the IPL auction to be held yesterday due to the poor form of Yuvraj Singh, the highest selling explosive batsman in the IPL

 Among the trends achieved so far, bjp's storm is also prevailing in the northeast states of the country
 yahaan kul 14 loksabhaa siton par bijepi shuruyaat se badhat banaae hue he
 Talking about the whole country, bjp-led NDA is ahead in 340 seats while UPA is in only 96 seats
 upie se acha anya dal kar rahe hai jinke khate main 106 siten jaati dikh rahi hai
 If the BJP has performed well in the North East states, then the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizens Bill can be held responsible for this
 chunaav se pehle is mudde ko lekar na sirf uttar purvi rajyon main baari virodh hua balki rashtriya str par bhi virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The matter went to the Supreme Court and the opposition parties simultaneously surrounded the BJP on several fronts
 ho-hangaame ke baavjood bijepi apane mishan main tus se mas nahin hui or ise lagu karaane ke liye drudh pratigya jaahir kii
 Significantly, the Assam government started the process of updating NRC in December 2013
 rajya ke sabhi logon ko apane dastavejon ko pesh karne ke liye kaha gaya tha, taaki yah sabit ho sake ki unke parivaar 24 march, 1971 se pehle bharat main rah rahe hai
 Later its draft was released in which 3
 29 karod aavedakon main 40 lakh se zyada log ghuspaithiye paae gaye
 The BJP in its response said that outsiders would not be allowed to occupy the resources of Assam under any circumstances
 bijepi ne bahari logon ko unke desh bhejne kii bhi prakriya shuru kii jisamen kuch rohingya musalmaan myanmar bheje gaye
 Parties like Congress and Trinamool Congress strongly opposed this but BJP was successful in its agenda
 kah sakate hai ki assam main shuru hua yah abhiyaan uttar purv ke anya rajyon main bhi acha asar choda or yah mudda vot banane main kaamyaab rahaa
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself appeared campaigning in Assam on this issue and said that "just as Modi has taken action against Naxalites and terrorists, Modi is not going to leave the infiltrators
" duusari taraf yah chaukeedaar sharnaarthiyon se nyaay karegaa, jo congress kii aitihaasik chook ke peedit hai
 "modi's statement seems to be an infallible target in Assam as BJP is leading in 9 seats out of the total 14 seats here
 uttar purvi rajyon main citijanship bill kaa mudda bhi kaaphi surkhiyon main rahaa jise bijepi lekar ai thi
 It was also strongly opposed by opposition parties and at one time it was being said that the BJP may have to bear the brunt of it
 haalanki matganana ke rujhaan bataa rahe hai ki uttar purv main bijepi jis tarah se badhat banaae hue he, use dekhakar nahin kaha ja saktaa ki citijanship bill kaa mudda bijepi ko dhokhaa de gaya
 This issue came to the headlines when there was a lot of uproar in Parliament
 haalanki trinmul congress sahit kai vipakshi dalon ke virodh ke baavjood naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak paarit ho gaya
 The bill provides for the removal of obstacles for people of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan from six non-muslim minority groups to gain Indian citizenship
 yah maamla itnaa badha ki purvottar kii 11 raajnneetik partiyaan naagarikta vidheyak ke khilaaf ekajute huin or centre sarkaar se ise radd karne kii apil kii gai
 On the other hand the government remained firm on its intention but assured the people of North East that their interests were not damaged

 After the session, he asked cricket coach MP Singh to teach him all that again

 He said, "you are an Indian player, have scored a century and now you want to learn all this?" Dhoni said effortlessly, "it is important to learn, anytime
" ” jaahir he, khel dhoni ke swabhaav main he or cricket unke liye paidaaishi baat he
 filmdhoni - The Untold Story Recall the scene when Dhoni, while looking after his motorcycles, achieves what was stopping him from succeeding
 dhoni rakshaatmak khel ke liye nahin bane hai
 The same thing was said to him in the film as well, and Dhoni might have understood the same thing this time, but this time the way is different
 badhati umr kaa takaza tha ki unhen apni timming par kaam karne kii jarurat thi
 Dhoni has reduced the weight of his bats (he usually uses two different weight bats in his innings)
 isi se unki timming behatar ho gai he
 And perhaps because of this Dhoni is able to put the same shots, which are all of us
 aapako 2004 ke april main pakistan ke khilaaf vishakhapatnam ke match kii yaad he? navagantuk or kandhe tak lambey baalo vaale wicket keeper ballebaaj mahendra singh dhoni ne pakistaniyon ko washing powder se dhoyaa or 123 gendon main 148 ran kuta die the
 Then you will also remember the Jaipur ODI in October 2005, when Dhoni scored 183 not out from 145 balls against Sri Lanka
 pakistan ke khilaaf 2006 kii farvari main lahore main naabad 72 ran kii pari ho, yaa phir karanchi main 56 gendon main naabad 77 ran
 Even in the 2011 World Cup final, Dhoni's unassuming face would have brought a smile to your face when he hit just 79 balls for his unbeaten innings of 91 runs
 hamaara vahi dhoni waapas aa gaya lagata he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is seen in his old avatar in Australia's ODI series
 kirdaar thodaa badla he
 Maestro of Dhunai, but Kutai is not a little hard
 ab vah kasaai kii tarah chapad (bada chaaku) nahin chalaate, ab vah shalya chikitsak kii tarah najaakat se nashtar pherate hai
 The bat is now moving as if the painter was moving on the canvas
 vahi dhoni, jiske liye ham unki kadra karte aa rahe hai
 Dhoni is seen as the same lady that we saw years ago, when his hair used to come to the shoulders and was dyed in a bit of Burgundy color
 tab dhoni noujvaan the
 But when the bowlers are crushing at the hands of today's Dhoni and seeing the ball flying in the air and falling in the audience, then they are sure that hey, the power of the Hercules in the hands of the middle-aged Dhoni in the fourth decade of age is still Is also intact
 or dhoni us takat kaa bakhubi istemaal kar rahe hai
 Just remember the strength of sixes and fours flown in the 49th over of the second and third ODI of Australia series
 is siries main maahi ne sabit kar diya ki bade khilaadi ko bas ek dfa gear badalanaa hota he
 At the age of 37, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has scored a total of 193 runs in this ODI series against Australia and he was adjudged 'man of the Series' for this brilliant performance
 isse pehle dhoni ko chayankartaaon ne westeindies or australia ke khilaaf tii-20 team se drop kiya tha, lekin maahi ne kangaaroon ke khilaaf joardaar vaapasi karte hue apane aalochakon ko karaara jawaab diya he
 Dhoni was unbeaten twice in this series and once he was the victim of the umpire's very poor decision
 sidney main khele gaye 3 maichon kii vanade siries ke pehle match main dhoni ne 51 ran banaae
 In that match, Dhoni was dubbed LBW by the umpire while the ball was pitched outside the leg stump
 sidney main bharat ko 34 ranon se haar mili, lekin dhoni ne edilade main khele gaye duusare vanade match main naabad 55 ran banaakar bharat ko 6 wicket se jeet dilaai
 In the last and deciding match of the series played in Melbourne, Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored an unbeaten 87 in a situation when the top 3 batsmen of Team India could not make it to fifty
 mahendra singh dhoni (naabad 87) or kedaar jadhav (naabad 61) ke bich chauthe wicket ke liye hui 121 ranon kii saajhedaari ke dam par bharat ne austrailia ko melbern main saat se wicket maat di
 After this historic victory, Dhoni was selected as the 'man of the Series' in the One Day International Series after 8 years
 aakhri baar dhoni ko 'main of da siries' kaa khitaab england ke khilaaf saal 2011 main kheli gai 5 maichon kii gharelu vanade international siries main mila tha
 This is Dhoni's 7th Man of the Series award in the One Day International Series
 melbern main dhoni ne 114 gend khelte hue chah chauke kii madad se naabad 87 ran kii pari kheli jabaki jadhav ne 57 gend main saat chauke se naabad 61 ran banaae
 Personally, Virat Kohli has also played well, but this time in the first ODI, many critics questioned Dhoni's slow play
 par dhoni ne phir bhi pachaasa thonka tha
 In the second ODI, he was the victor of victory and in the third ODI, his name was in the batting
 kedaar jadhav unki chaaya main khele or behatar hi khele
 If anyone can give a challenge to Dhoni to remain normal even after victory, then he is the only Indian Abhinav Bindra
 cricket main shant bane rahane kii jarurat nahin hoti, uske baavjood dhoni ne apane dhairya se apni shakhsiyat ko or abha hi bakshi he
 It is a sign of a mature and stable brain, which realizes that success is not a one-time thing, it has to be sustained
 aise log atiutsahit nahin hote
 They keep their happiness to themselves, thus achieving more achievements than average people
 unhone hameshaa aalochakon kaa munh band kiya he or senior khilaadiyon se apni baat manavaai he
 He has served as an inspiration for an entire generation of small towns
 dhoni kii kahani shabdon main bayaan karnaa aasaan nahin
 His innings still continues
 helicopter shot lagane vaale dhoni ne khud ko is baar rocket kii tarah sthapit kiya he
 Dhoni's fans are happy one time
 chakke lag rahe hai par gaganchumbi nahin hai
 But what difference does it make even if you hit the ball out of the boundary, no matter how far you go, you get six runs
 sanasanaate chaukon kii barsaat se gendon ke dhaage khulte dekh rahe hai
 Commentators are surprised by his sharp eyesight as Dhoni review system, and sometimes he is giving money as Dhoni Dhanadhan Dhoni
 kabhi unako tanj se mahendra bahubali kehane vaale sahvaag jaise camentator bhi khamosh hai
 Dhoni is also silent, but his bat is speaking
 par is baar balle se jaiz nahin shastreey sangeet ke sur nikal rahe hai

 According to this, waiting for several months after the application of Talak will not be necessary
 marij act main badlaav kii kuch mukhya baaten ye hai:-talaak ke liye jaruri sharton main ek nai shart shaamil kii gai he
 If there is a marriage condition in which there is no scope for improvement, then under this condition, if the wife files for divorce, the husband cannot file a protest
 lekin agar pati kii arji he or patni ne virodh darj kara diya he, to court us par vichaar karegaa
 -talk will be available soon, but now after divorce, wife's right will also be on your property, which you have collected after marriage
 patni ko kitni sampatti milegi, iskaa faisla court karegaa
 If divorce occurs, the rights of the adopted child will also be the same as that of the children born to them
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii adhyakshata main huimantrimandal kii baithkmein yah faisla kiya gaya
 Apart from giving rights in the property of the husband, the purpose of the Marriage Laws (amendment) Bill 2010 is to give the adopted children equal rights as children born to parents
 isse purv do saal pehle rajyasabha main yah vidheyak pesh kiya gaya tha
 Then it was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Personnel

 During the attack, the bike riders kept firing on the car for half a kilometer
 Video- kashmir main bijepi netaa gauhar ahamed kii hatya, antim yatra main shaamil hue saikadon log The driver and one of his security personnel along with BJP leader Shiv Kumar Yadav were killed in the attack
 
 After this incident, sensation has spread in the area
 police is ghatana ke peeche aapasi ranjish maanakar chal rahi he or ab badmaashon kii talash kar rahi he
 Video: Hundreds of people attended the last visit of BJP leader Gauhar Ahmed in Kashmir hamale main bijepi netaa shiv kumaar yadav ke saath driver or unke ek surakshakarmi kii maut ho gai
 
 is ghatana ke baad ilaake main sansani fail gai he
 The police is believed to be a mutual scapegoat behind the incident and is now looking for miscreants
 uttarapradesh kii raajnneeti main sapa or basapa ne saath aakar kuch aisa kiya he jo kareeb 25 saal pehle bhi hua tha, magar is baar inkaa saath aana kaaphi myne rakhata he
 This alliance is going to change the picture of Indian politics
 mayawati or akhilesh donon ne apane ahan ko darkinar karte hue saath aane kaa faisla liya
 In Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party will contest 38-38 seats
 saath hi raibareli or amethi main koi ummidavaar bhi nahin khadey karegi
 Not only this, each seat is also left for some small parties
 is gathbandhan main ajit singh ke liye bhi jagah he
 The Samajwadi Party will also give them seats from its quota
 iskaa matlab he ki uttarapradesh main bijepi ke paas jahaan abhi 68 siten hai, sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne muqabla kadaa kar diya he
 If you add the Lok Sabha seats of five states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, then there are about 250 seats
 ab in rajyon main dekhte hai ki bijepi kaise halaat main he
 BJP had the biggest success in 2014 in Uttar Pradesh
 usne 80 main se 70 siton par jeet darj kii thi
 This trend continued even in 2017 when BJP registered a resounding victory in the assembly elections and formed Yogi's government
 magar uske baad se bijepi kaa graph girtaa najar aayaa
 Especially when the BJP lost both Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats in the by-elections to the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister seats
 baad main kairana main bhi bijepi ko shikast mili kyonki bijepi ke khilaaf vipaksh ikattha tha
 The SP and BSP are going to do the BJP together in 2019, many political experts believe this
 ab baat bihar kii karte hai
 Here the grand alliance stands firmly against the JDU, BJP and LJP alliance
 idhar argedy, congress, kushvaha or jeethanram maanjhi hai or voton kaa aankada 40 fisadi tak ja rahaa he
 That is, the battle is going to be tremendous in 40 seats of Bihar
 maharashtra main 48 siten hai
 Here it has been decided that the Congress and NCP will fight together
 magar shivasena or bijepi saath ladenge yah tay nahin he
 Similarly, there are 42 seats in West Bengal
 bijepi ke paas do siten hai
 Even if they are four, there will not be much difference
 tamilnadu main 39 siten hai, jahaan bijepi ke paas keval ek seat he baaki par ediemke yani jayalalita kii party kaa kabja he
 So will BJP go with AIADMK? It is not sure yet
 duusari ore diemke or congress kaa gathbandhan pakkaa he
 Experts believe that the victory of DMK and Congress is confirmed here
 yani loksabhaa kii in 250 siton par bijepi ke liye bahut utsahvardhak khabar nahin he
 There were 27 seats in Karnataka, where the Congress and JD (S) coalition will contest the elections together
 tab bijepi apni maujuuda 15 siten bhi bachaa le, aisa lagata nahin he
 Yes, if the congress-jds alliance breaks before the Lok Sabha elections, then the matter may be different
 isi tarah rajasthan kii sabhi 25 siton par bijepi kaa kabja he
 Now the government has changed there, so obviously BJP cannot win all 25 seats
 isi tarah madhyapradesh kii 29 siton main se 26 siton par bijepi kaa kabja he, magar ab vahaan kamalnath hai jo bijepi ko apana purana pradarshan dohraane nahin denge
 Apparently there is a famine of seats for the BJP in 2019, at least on paper
 haa yadi usne koi aisa mudda dhund liya jisase phir ek lahar uske paksh main chal jaae to baat kuch or ho sakati he
 For this you will have to wait for a few months
 vaise yah to tay he ki 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav kaaphi rochak or mjedaar hone vaala he

 After the Supreme Court dismissed the state government's petition against the Governor's decision to be appointed as the Lokayukta of Gujarat on Wednesday, the BJP claimed that accepting the supremacy of the cabinet in this decision was a victory of its stand
 party ke mukhya pravaktaa ravishankar prasad ne sheersh adaalat ke faisle ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘congress dwaara is nirnay ko khud kii jeet bataanaa ‘niraashaa kaa ronaa rone’ ke alaava or kuch nahin he

 In its decision, the apex court said that the Governor is bound to act as per the recommendation of the Council of Ministers but the appointment of Justice Mehta is appropriate here as it was done in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court

 The BJP spokesperson retaliated on the allegations of the Congress and said that the Congress, who were happy on this decision, should explain why action was not taken against the Delhi government minister Rajkumar Chauhan despite the Lokayukta's recommendations

 Baba Ramdev thanked the Supreme Court for issuing notice to the Center after taking suo motu cognizance of the police action on Ramlila ground and said that he also complained to the Human Rights and Women's Commission against the vandalism of the police at his fast in Delhi will do
 ramdev ne yahaan sthit apane patanjali yogapith parisar main somvaar subah se ‘satyagrah’ dobaaraa shuru karne ke baad samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘ramlila maidan par mere or mere samarthakon par hui karrwai par ucchtam nyaayalay ne swat: sangyaan lete hue centre, dilli prashasan or dilli ke police ayukta ko notice jari kiya he
 We are thankful to the court and the Chief Justice
 ’unhone kaha, ‘ramlila maidan par police ne mahilaon or bacchon par barbar karrwai kii
 In view of this, the National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission for Women should also take suo motu cognizance
 ham in donon aayogon main bhi shikaayat karenge
 The Yogguru said, "the incident of the Supreme Court taking suo motu is important because at this time there is an atmosphere of despair and mistrust in the country
" aise main loktantr kii sthirataa ke liye janata kaa nyaay vyavastha main vishwaas bane rahanaa jaruri he
 The court, taking automatic cognizance of the action of forcing Ramdev and his supporters out of Ramlila Maidan, issued notice to the Union Home Secretary, the Chief Secretary of Delhi and the Commissioner of Police of Delhi seeking a reply within two weeks
 nyaayalay ne sawaal kiya he ki aisi kya paristhitiyaan thim ki logon ko aadhi raat ko bal prayog kar hataanaa padaa
 Meanwhile, the BJP also said that it would hold a peaceful protest across the country on the issue of action taken against Ramdev's movement and would meet President Pratibha Patil and urge him to call a special session of Parliament to discuss the issue

 On whether he would participate in Hazare's fast, Ramdev told reporters in Haridwar, 'the police has banned me from going to Delhi
 main vahaan kanoon kaa ulanghan kar kaise ja saktaa hum
 'he said,' As much anger is not created after our three-day fast, as much anger has arisen in one day due to the action of the government
 ’ unhone kaha ki ramlila maidan par lathicharge nahin hone kaa dilli police kaa daawa jhootha he
 Police used sticks on women and children there
 ramdev ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki unke anshan sthal par manch main teen baar aag lagane kii police ne koshish kii
 The police also sent a fake e-mail stating that there could be tension between Hindus and Muslims due to their fast
 unhone kaha, ‘ramlila maidan par meri hatya kii sajeesh hone kaa ham sirf aarope nahin laga rahe hai
 Facts suggest that a conspiracy was hatched
 ’ yoga guru ne aarope lagaaya ki police ke khilaaf koi maamla darj nahin ho, iske liye dilli ke aspataalon main bhartee unke samarthakon kii upachaar hone se pehle hi chuttee kar di gayi
 On the question whether it was not her weakness to come out of Ramlila Maidan in women's attire, Ramdev said, "mothers and sisters have been a big contributor to protect me at the fast
 main ise kamajori nahin maanata
 i protected myself like Chhatrapati Shivaji
 ’ koun-koun se sanghathan unke saath hai, is par yoga guru ne kaha ki art of living ke shri shri ravishankar, anna hazaare or murari baapu sahit kai dharmik-aadhyatmik sanghathanon kaa unhen samarthan praapt he

 Union Minister Vilas Rao Deshmukh was seen trying to chop off the head of the 'adarsh' scam of former Chief Minister Ashok Chavan when he told the judicial panel probing the case that the land was allotted to the society only after getting approval from the Revenue Department Has gone
 deshmukh ke pehle kaarykaal ke samay ashok chavaan rajasav mantri the, jab kolaba main vivaadit houseing sosayadi ke liye jameen aavantit kii gai thi
 While giving a statement as a witness in front of the panel, Deshmukh said, "when a file demanding the allocation of government land is submitted to the Chief Minister's Office, the Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister sees whether the proposal has been approved by the Revenue Minister
 
 agar use manjuuri mili hoti he or rajasav mantri evam anya adhikariyon ke bich koi matbhed nahin hota to sachiv is bare main mukhyamantri ko suchit karata he or sweekruti de di jaati he
 The Union Minister of Science and Technology expressed ignorance on several questions asked during his testimony and said that the revenue department did not tell him that the land where the building would be built belonged to the local military authority and there was a garden
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri ke taur par deshmukh kaa kaarykaal aktubar 1999 se janvari 2003 or uske baad november 2004 se disambar 2008 ke bich rahaa
 He had issued an order letter for the allotment of government land to the Adarsh society and issued a notification directing him to reduce the width of the Captain Prakash Pethe Marg passing through this grand building situated in South Mumbai
 mantri ne kaha ki shahari vikaas vibhaag ke sachiv ne unhen nahin bataaya tha ki 10 april 2002 kii adhisuchana ke jariye captain pethe maarg kii chaudaai kam karne ko lekar aapatti uthaai gai thi
 He said, 'I was not told that MSRDC has raised objection to the notification
 shahari vikaas sachiv ne yah bhi nahin bataaya ki sosayadi ne vivaadit bhoomi par farvari 2001 se hi kabja hone kaa daawa kiya he
 Kanhaiya Lal Gidwani, one of the promoters of the society and Congress corporator, said in a letter to Deshmukh that the land has been occupied by the society since 2001
 deshmukh ne kaha ki vah varsh 2000 main adarsh maamle se do chaar hue jab unhen sosayadi se jameen ke aavanton ke bare main patr mila
 He said, 'I wrote a comment on the letter and said that it should be immediately handed over to the revenue department, after that i did not see what action was taken by the revenue department
 deshmukh ne kaha ki gidwani ne adarsh sosayadi ke sandarbh main unhen kai patr likhe athwa unase mili
 He said, 'as a corporator, Gidwani had easy access to the Chief Minister
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki sosayadi sena ke adhikariyon or unke pariwaron ke liye he
 Deshmukh's statement came after Union Power Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde tried to wash his hands off the scam
 scindia ne kaha tha ki sarkari jameen ke aavanton or houseing sosayadi ko atirikt ennesai dene kaa faisla deshmukh ke mukhyamantri kaal main kiya gaya tha
 Shinde and Deshmukh handled files related to the controversial society during their tenure as Chief Ministers of Maharashtra
 scindia ne ucch nyaayalay ke sevanivrutt nyaayadhish kii adhyakshata vaale panel ko bataaya tha, ‘adarsh sosayadi ko jameen dene kaa faisla mukhyamantri ke taur par mere padbhaar sanbhaalane se pehle hi ho chukaa tha
 The order in favor of Adarsh was issued on 18 January 2003, when Vilasrao Deshmukh was the Chief Minister
 yah mere nirdesh par jari nahin kiya gaya or na hi kabhi meri jaankaree main laayaa gaya
 The Commission has already reached the conclusion that the land belonged to the state government and not to the Ministry of Defense
 ab yah is baat kii jaanch kar rahaa he ki sosayadi ko jameen dene kii prakriya main niyamon kaa ulanghan hua yaa nahin
 Deshmukh's statement, which arrived to testify with his elder son Amit, will continue tomorrow
 chavaan ko 30 june ko nyaayik ayog ke saamne pesh hona he

 The 84 ghats, spanning about 4 miles from Assi Ghat to Raja Ghat, are built in a crescent shape with sandstone in such a way that you are seeing the truth of life on a crescent-free celestial platform
 It is when you see the queues of the nobles of Rajasthan and Bengal from the Peshwa of Gwalior on the banks of the Ganges
 shaayad sarvadhara or sarv samahit kii hamaari soch in ghaaton par bani in oonchi oonchi imaaraton main sahej kar rakhi gai he or shaayad isi soch ne uttar vahini maa ganga ke kinare bane in ghaaton ke manch or ganga kii laharon ke bich shant vaataavaran main samay-samay par kabhi tulsi ke maanas ko shabd diye, kabhi kabir or raidas ko jivan kii satyata kaa bodh karaayaa, to kabhi pandit kanthe mahraaj, kishan mahraaj ke table kii taal ban kar bahi, to kabhi bismmila kii shehanai ban puri duniya ko mantrmugdh kiya
 The same thinking always chimes these ghats by becoming the taunts of the throats and throats of dozens of music admirers like Gudai Maharaj, Sitara Devi, Girja Devi
 apane mahapurushon ke inhi jhankaar ko saheje ghaaton kii bolti in tasveeron kaa craij aaj duniya bhar ke photographeron ke sir chadh kar bol rahaa he
 Hence photo tourism has increased rapidly in Banaras these days and photographers from all over the world are coming to see Banaras with the eyes of the camera
 itnaa hi nahin duniya main hone vaali street photography kii pratiyogita main banaras ke hi photographer, street photographer category main duusare nambar par chune gaye
 Photographs taken from any angle of the Ghats of Benares are seen to describe the life of the Ghats
 inhi bolti tasveeron ko apane camere main qaid karne ke liye duniya bhar ke photographeron ke qadam banaras ke in ghaaton par chahalqadami karte dikh jaaenge
 One of them is Karen and Daisy from England who are incarcerating every aspect of Banaras in camera these days
 karen or dezi kahati hai ki photography ke lihaaj se ye duniya kii sabase khubasurat jagah he
 Where the light is very good, absolutely soft, it is a very old city and the people here are very good
 banaras kaa ye anoothaapan sirf uske ghaaton main nahin balki uski galiyon main bhi he
 Where the paintings of the Musbari art on the walls and the old texture of the houses provide these subjects to their favorite subjects
 yahi vajah he ki in videshi chhayakaaron ke qadam in galiyon main bhi padate hai or wo yahaan kii jeevantata ko apane camere main qaid karne ke liye betaab nazar aate hai
 Previously tourists used to visit here only, now a new thing has come
 har tourist yahaan ab photographer kii tarah aata he or har photographer ab yahaan aakar haath maajana chahta he kyonki isse zyaada khubasurat unhen duniya main kahin nahin miltaa
 This photography tourism in Benares is a new era
 kyonki watsap, fasebuk, soshal media par yahaan kii tasviren yahaan ke street photographer vinay or manish jaise photographeron ke jariye duniya main pahunchane lageen
 When it rose to prominence, it became a photo walker group
 jisamen manish ko to apane ghaaton kii alag-alag zindagi ke rang si bhari tasveeron ne duniya main hone vaali street photography pratiyogita main puure vishwa main duusare nambar kaa street photographer bana diya
 The comments is photo tourism ne ek nai demand bhi paidaa kii he, wo he photo tourist guide kii
 Which Benaras photographers like Manish and Vinay are accomplishing without any money
 kehane kaa matlab ye ki banaras ke ye ghat bejaan pathar ke nahin, ye bolte bhi hai, lihaaja hamane jo pehle mahasoos kiya wo satya hi he ki zarur kabhi in ghaaton ne tulsi ke maanas ko shabd diye honge, kabhi kabir or raidas ko jivan kii satyata kaa bodh karaayaa hoga, to kabhi pandit kanthe mahraaj, kishan mahraaj ke table kii thap ko nai oonchai di hogi
 And today these ghats are not only mesmerizing photographers from all over the world with their spoken pictures but are also pulling them towards them
 or yahi banaras ke ghaaton kii jeevantata bhi he tabhi to nazir banarsi kehete hai ki 'laharaate dabe paanv chali jaati he ganga, kya jaaniye kya gaati he ganga, ja ke mere paas palat aati he ganga, milte hai jo afsaane wo duharaati he ganga

 Perhaps our thinking of omnidirectional and all-encompassing has been preserved in these tall high-rise buildings built on these ghats and perhaps this same thinking has taken place from time to time in the calm atmosphere between the platform of these ghats on the banks of the North Ganges mother Ganga and the waves of the Ganges
 But sometimes gave words to the mind of Tulsi, sometimes made Kabir and Raidas realize the truth of life, sometimes Pandit Kanthe Maharaj, Kishan Maharaj's tabla, and sometimes Bismillah's shehna Became mesmerized the whole world
 yahi soch gudai mahraaj, sitara devi, girizaa devi jaise darjanon sangeet marmagyon kii gale kii taan or ghunghruon kii jhankaar ban kar in ghaaton ko hameshaa zankrut karatin he
 The craze of these pictures that speak to the ghats saved by these great men of their ghats, is speaking to the heads of photographers all over the world today
 lihaaja banaras main in dinon photo tourism teji se badha he or duniya bhar ke photographer camere kii nigahon se banaras ko dekhne aa rahe hai
 Not only this, in the competition of street photography to be held in the world, only photographer from Benaras was selected second in the street photographer category
 banaras ke ghaaton kii kisi bhi angel se khinchi hui tasviren ghaaton kii zindagi ko bayaan karti nazar aati hai
 Photographers from all over the world will be seen strolling these ghats of Benares to imprison these spoken pictures in their cameras
 inhen main se ek england se ai karen or dezi he jo in dinon banaras ke har pahalu ko hameshaa ke liye camere main qaid kar rahi hai
 Karen and Daisy say that it is the most beautiful place in the world in terms of photography
 jahaan lite bahut acchhee he, ek dam soft, ye bahut puraani nagari he or yahaan ke log bahut achche hai
 This uniqueness of Banaras lies not just in its ghats but also in its streets
 jahaan deevaaron par bani masabari kala ke chitra or gharon kii puraani banaavat in photographeron ko unke man pasand subject uplabdh karaate hai
 This is the reason that the steps of these foreign cinematographers fall in these streets as well and they seem desperate to imprison the life here in their camera
 pehle tourist yahaan sirf ghoomane aata tha, ab ek nai cheez ai he
 Every tourist now comes here as a photographer and every photographer now wants to come here and ask for help because nothing more beautiful than this is found in the world
 banaras main ye photography tourism nae jamaane kii dein he
 Because the pictures here on whatsapp, Facebook, social media started reaching the world through the photographers like Street photographer Vinay and Manish
 jab isaki shoharat hui to baqayada ek photo walker group ban gaya
 In which Manish made colorful photographs of different lives of his ghats, making him the second number street photographer in the world in street photography competition held in the world
 tippaniyan This photo tourism has also created a new demand, that is photo tourist guide
 jise manish or vinay jaise banaras ke photographer bina kisi paise ke puraa kar rahe hai
 It means to say that these ghats of Banaras speak not of lifeless stone, they also speak, so the first thing we realized is that these Ghats must have given words to the mind of Tulsi, sometimes Kabir and Raidas should have a life
 Must have made the realization of the truth, then at some time the beat of Pandit Kanthe Maharaj, Kishan Maharaj's tabla would have given new height
 or aaj yahi ghat apni bolti tasveeron se duniya bhar ke photographeron ko na sirf mantrmugdh kiye hue hai balki unhen apni taraf khinch bhi rahe hai
 And this is also the life of the Ghats of Banaras, then only Nazir Banarsi says that the waving leaves the Ganges, what you know, what the Ganga sings, the Ganga comes back to me; apane mahapurushon ke inhi jhankaar ko saheje ghaaton kii bolti in tasveeron kaa craij aaj duniya bhar ke photographeron ke sir chadh kar bol rahaa he

 He wrote, 'PV Sindhu

 Although Ambareesh won the election, it is said that he could not get out of the actor's stardom

 com / q0fjocwa2q Anwar Ahmed, who came from Jalalpur town of Ambedkar Nagar district in Uttar Pradesh, has been very interested in comparative studies since the beginning
 dashakon se puure hindustan or khadi deshon main bhi ve mushaairon ke sanchaalan ke liye jane jate hai
 The person, who has been named Anwar Jalalpuri in poetry, has recently been conferred with the Yash Bharti Award by the Uttar Pradesh government which is among the highest awards in the state
 is maukey par ham unka saal bhar purana ek intervyuu pesh kar rahe hai
 Anwar Jalalpuri's identity took a new shape when he did the difficult task of bringing Shrimad Bhagwadgita into Urdu poetry
 is kaam ko mahaj anuwaad kahana samajhadaari na hogi
 He has presented the essence of the world in very simple language
 padhate vakt saaf lagata he ki gita ko jaise unhone ek aam aadmi ko samajhane laayak banane kii jid-si pakad lee he
 His half-hearted, 63-year-old Alima Khatoon is a witness to the step-by-step of this four-year venture
 raat-raat bhar jagakar ek-ek lafj, misare or sher ko sunakar pehali shrota ke rup main yathasthaan unhone tabdili bhi karai he
 Now he has introduced the translation of 72 rubies of Umar Khayyam and Geetanjali of Tagore in an equally easy language
 lekin philhal ve gita ke alaava or kisi pahalu par baat karne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Ramkatha singer Morari Bapu and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav inaugurated it recently in Lucknow
 majaa dekhie ki hindi ke 2-3 swanaamadhanya prakashkon ne ise chhapane laayak hi nahin samajha
 In the end, he was able to bring it to the readers after getting 500 copies printed with a small last publication
 lakhanu main lalkuan sthit apane awaas par 67 varshiya jalalpuri ne assistant editorshivakeshase baatcheet kii
 You also read the selected portions of the same: As you have also written in the role that you had gone back earlier in view of the subject of Gita and its expansion
 2008 main phir kaise yah kaam shuru kiya?sahitya kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan mere swabhaav main rahaa he
 While filling the form in BA, filled English, Urdu and Arabic Literature
 yani andar kahin swabhaav main yah baat baithi hui thi
 Having read Islam, i thought that books of Hinduism should also be read
 to gita, ramcharitamanas or upanishdon ke kuch hisse padhe
 While reading the Gita, it seemed that there are many things in it which are also in the Quran and the hadiths of the Prophet
 pichley 150 varsh main gita ke 24 tarjume hue hai
 But that era was of Persianized Urdu
 mushkil se 8-10 kitaaben mil pain

 Some rabbits are also jumping with the sound of chirping

 Ducks are wavering in their ways
 dilli se 90 kimi dur rajasthan ke alvar jile ke patan kala main sthit 40 acre ke is ramnik farm main kuch jaanavar hai jo bikri ke liye hai
 But ducks are not sold at all

 The farm cultivates 13 species of lettuce, including Boston, Bib, Lola Rosa, and Batavia
 inke alaava safed shaljam, golden bellroots (chukundar), scoch banet sareekhee carabian mirch, shatavar, artchok, fennell or japani shaiwal okahiziki bhi ugaaya jaataa he
 Such greens and vegetables are considered as something special in India
 abhi haal tak inamen se kisi kii bhi kheti yahaan nahin kii jaati thi
 Large restaurants in the country imported everything from salad leaves to European vegetables from abroad
 yah sari kavayad un amir graahakon ko aakarshith karne ke liye thi jo arugula or baby raidish ke salad yaa brashetta jaise gaiyr hybrid tamaato ke liye baari rakam chukaa sakate hai (brashetta aise tamaato ko kehete hai, jiske beej aam taur par kai peedhishon se chale aa rahe hon)
 The trend of cultivation of foreign vegetables and vegetables in India has increased very fast in the last three years

 Their customers mostly consist of restaurants run in five star hotels

 Grewal, who started cultivating foreign vegetables and vegetables three years ago, sells them through his retail outlet The Altitude Store in Delhi and Gurgaon
 is tarah kii saag-subjiyon kii baari maang rahati he
 Sales at Grewal are growing at a rate of 150 to 200 per cent annually
 bhartiya krishi anusandhan parishad (isiaar) ke mutabik, videshi saag-subjiyon kaa bazaar salanaa 15 se 20 fisadi kii dar se bad rahaa he
 However, like Grewal, most of its farmers are able to see very fast growth figures due to small scale beginnings
 isaki vajah jaananaa kathin nahin he
 The restaurant industry is growing at a rapid pace due to the country's young population
 aise yuvaaon ke paas kharch karne laayak aamadani main ijapha ho rahaa he or unamem baahar khaane-pine kaa chalan bad rahaa he
 Awareness of different types of food is also increasing around the world

 It could reach $ 78 billion in the next five years
 yani yah kareeb utana hi ho jayega jitne kaa philhal bhartiya ity udyog niryaat karata he
 The sales volume is actually increasing, but restaurant owners want to keep the import bill low and chefs are looking for a way to create a dish that has a low carbon footprint
 khaadya padaarthon ko vimaan se mangane kaa matlab he ki iske liye zyada urja khapat hoti he or zyada carbon utsarjan hota he
 Anupam Banerjee, executive chef at The ritz-carlton Hotel in Bangalore, says, "apart from the carbon footprint and quality, it is also important to know where the greens are grown from which we are cooking

 Among the reasons for this tragedy in Kerala, the Kerala government has refused to reduce the level of water in the Mulla Mulliyapariyarbandh from the Tamil Nadu government and later on it suddenly is a major reason
 darasalsupreme courtmen kerala sarkaar kii taraf se daakhil halfannaame main kaha gaya he ki mullaperiyar baandh main jal kaa str bad jane ke baad achaanak pani chode jane kii vajah se yah baadh ai he
 The affidavit states that the Tamil Nadu government was requested to release water gradually up to 139 feet, but despite the request there was no positive assurance from the Tamil Nadu government
 phir achaanak hi mullaperiyar baandh se pani chode jane se kerala sarkaar koidukkijalashay se adhik pani chhodane ke liye baadhya hona padaa
 Which is a major cause of this flood
 kerala sarkaar ne nyaayalay main daakhil halafname main kaha ki is baadh se kerala kii kul kareeb 3
 Out of 48 crore population, more than 54 lakh people have been affected by the floods
 rajya sarkaar ne kaha he ki uske ejiniyaron dwaara pehle se sachet kiye jane ke kaaran rajya ke jal sansaadhan sachiv ne tamilnadu sarkaar main apane samakaksh or mullaperiyar baandh kii nigaraanee samiti ko patr likhakar anurodh kiya tha ki jalashay ke jalastr ko apane adhiktam str par pahunchane kaa intjaar kiye bagaiyr hi pani chhodane kii prakriya niyantrit kii jaae
 On behalf of the Kerala government, it was said that to prevent recurrence of such situation, the command of the monitoring committee should be handed over to the chairman of the Central Water Commission and the secretaries of both the states should be made its members
 is samiti ko baadh athwa aise kisi sankat ke samay bahumat se nirnay lene kaa adhikaar diya janaa chahie
 The Kerala government has also requested to constitute a managing committee to manage the daily operations of the Mullaperiyar Dam

 Kolkata was not expected to get bad news so soon because the person admitted to BM Birla Hospital was famous in his life in the name of Comeback Man
 lekin duniya ke sabase amir cricket board kaa mukhiya jindagi kii jang haar gaya
 Jagmohan Dalmiya may have been known as Jaggu Da among his fans, but he was known as Machiavelli and Master of Realpolitik of Indian cricket
 ye niknem bhartiya cricket board main unki haisiyat ko bataata he
 In fact, today India is the world's largest market of cricket, and India's dominance in world cricket is looking strong, so Dalmiya contributed a lot in it
 kolkata ke is marwari kaarobaari ne encapi salve ke sapane ko aies bindra ke saath milakar vahaan tak pahunchaa diya jahaan se cricket kii duniya ko bharat apane andaaj main haankane laga
 This was more than three and a half decades before the dominance of N
 Srinivasan
 bharat ne 1983 kaa world cap jeet kar duniya ko chaunkaaya tha or tatkaaleen board adhyaksh salve ne is jeet ke jashn main 1987 ke world cap kii mejabani kaa daawa thok diya
 Jagmohan Dalmiya had become the treasurer at that time
 ye wo daur tha jab globaligeshan kaa daur shuru nahin hua tha
 There were no 24-hour satellite channels and cricket infrastructure in India was also present at the counting centers but Dalmia's financial management skills made the 1987 World Cup memorable
 iske baad daalamia ne mudakar nahin dekha
 In 1996, he again managed to organize a successful World Cup in the Indian subcontinent
 unki ginati duniya ke sabase taqatvar bos ke rup main hone lagi thi
 The BBC included him among the six big sports officials of the year
 1997 main ve isisi ke president bane or teen saal tak is pad par rahe
 During this success, Jaggu Da was far ahead of his friends, then opponents also started growing
 sharad pavaar ke dabadabe kaa daur aayaa to jagmohan daalamia ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 But allegations of financial irregularities were not found correct and Dalmia managed to make his comeback in 2010 at the BCCI
 tippaniyan And during the tenure of N
 Srinivasan, when Indian cricket came into its worst crisis, the consensus remained in the name of Jagmohan Dalmiya
 10 saal baad daalamia usee bisisiai ke mukhiya ban gaye jahaan se unhen janaa padaa tha
 However, he had to show softness to Srinivasan as Srinivasan was instrumental in his return to the BCCI
 lekin daalamia dosti ke saath apane pad kii jimmedaariyaan bhi nibhaa rahe the
 And coincidentally, even before bcci's most important AGM, there was no religious situation in front of them
 jagmohan daalamia kii pahchaan cricket kii duniya main tej tarraar bos kii thi lekin ve sabko saath lekar chalane kii kala main paarangat the
 Therefore, they will miss the Indian cricket administration
 jagmohan daalamia apane chaahane waalon main bhale jaggu da ke naam se mashhoor rahe hon lekin unhen bhartiya cricket kaa maikiyaveli or master of realpolitic ke naam se janaa jaataa rahaa
 This nickname reflects his status on the Indian Cricket Board
 darasal aaj bharat cricket kii duniya kaa sabase bada bazaar he or vishwa cricket main bharat kaa dabadabaa majboot dikh rahaa he to isamen daalamia kaa bada yogadan rahaa
 The Kolkata-based Marwari businessman took the dream of NKP Salve along with IS Bindra to reach India from where the cricket world was shaping up
 ye sab en shrinivasana ke dabadabe se koi saadhe teen dashak se pehle kii baat he
 India surprised the world by winning the 1983 World Cup, and the then Board President Salve rejected the claim of hosting the 1987 World Cup in celebration of this victory
 us vakt jagmohan daalamia koshadhyaksh bane hi the
 This was the period when globalization did not begin
 24 ghante ke satellite channel nahin the or bharat main cricket kii buniyadi suvidhaayen bhi ginati ke kendron par maujuud thim lekin daalamia ke vittiya prabandhan ke kaushal ne 1987 ke world cap ko yaadgaar bana diya
 After this Dalmiya did not look back
 1996 main ve ekbar phir bhartiya upmahadweep main world cap kaa kaamyaab aayojan karaane main kaamyaab rahe
 He was counted as the most powerful boss in the world
 bibisi nen unhen saal ke chah bade khel adhikariyon main shaamil kiya tha
 In 1997, he became the President of the ICC and held this position for three years
 is kamyaabi ke dauraan jaggu da apane doston se bahut aage nikal aae the to virdohi bhi badhane lage
 When the era of Sharad Pawar's domination came, Jagmohan Dalmiya was shown the way out
 lekin vittiya aniyamitata ke aarope sahi nahin paae gaye or daalamia bisisiai main 2010 main apni vaapasi karne main kaamyaab rahe
 The comments or en shrinivasana ke kaarykaal main jab bhartiya cricket apane sabase sankat ke daur main aayaa to sarvasammati jagmohan daalamia ke naam par hi bani
 10 years later, Dalmiya became the head of the same BCCI from where he had to go
 haalanki unhen shrinivasana ke prati narmi dikhaani pad rahi thi kyonki bisisiai main unki vaapasi main shrinivasana kii ahm bhoomika thi
 But Dalmia was also carrying out the responsibilities of his position with friendship
 or sanyog dekhie bisisiai ke sabase ahm agm se pehle unke saamne dharmsankat ti sthiti bhi nahin baniin
 Jagmohan Dalmiya was identified as the fiery boss in the cricket world but he was proficient in the art of taking everyone along
 lihaaja bhartiya cricket prashasan main unki kami khalegi
 In fact, today India is the world's largest market of cricket, and India's dominance in world cricket is looking strong, so Dalmiya contributed a lot in it
 kolkata ke is marwari kaarobaari ne encapi salve ke sapane ko aies bindra ke saath milakar vahaan tak pahunchaa diya jahaan se cricket kii duniya ko bharat apane andaaj main haankane laga
 This was more than three and a half decades before the dominance of N
 Srinivasan
 bharat ne 1983 kaa world cap jeet kar duniya ko chaunkaaya tha or tatkaaleen board adhyaksh salve ne is jeet ke jashn main 1987 ke world cap kii mejabani kaa daawa thok diya
 Jagmohan Dalmiya had become the treasurer at that time
 ye wo daur tha jab globaligeshan kaa daur shuru nahin hua tha
 There were no 24-hour satellite channels and cricket infrastructure in India was also present at the counting centers but Dalmia's financial management skills made the 1987 World Cup memorable
 iske baad daalamia ne mudakar nahin dekha
 In 1996, he again managed to organize a successful World Cup in the Indian subcontinent
 unki ginati duniya ke sabase taqatvar bos ke rup main hone lagi thi
 The BBC included him among the six big sports officials of the year
 1997 main ve isisi ke president bane or teen saal tak is pad par rahe
 During this success, Jaggu Da was far ahead of his friends, then opponents also started growing
 sharad pavaar ke dabadabe kaa daur aayaa to jagmohan daalamia ko baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya gaya
 But allegations of financial irregularities were not found correct and Dalmia managed to make his comeback in 2010 at the BCCI

 Srinivasan, when Indian cricket came into its worst crisis, the consensus remained in the name of Jagmohan Dalmiya

 However, he had to show softness to Srinivasan as Srinivasan was instrumental in his return to the BCCI
 lekin daalamia dosti ke saath apane pad kii jimmedaariyaan bhi nibhaa rahe the
 And coincidentally, even before bcci's most important AGM, there was no religious situation in front of them

 ek kahawat he jab rome jal rahaa tha nero bansi baja rahaa tha kuch yahi sthiti rajdhani dilli kii he rajdhani dilli is samay ek bade sankat se guzar rahi he lekin hamaare netaa hai ki unhen is sthiti se koi lenaa dena hi nahin he is samay dilli main jis tarah kaa vaayu pradooshan he or jis tarah ke aankade mil rahe hai unase yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki dilli is samay duniya kaa sabase pradooshit shahar he pichley dinon kii baat karen to yahaan par sabase maheen kan yani piem 2
 The level of 5 reached 12 to 14 times the normal, similarly the amount of PM 10 was recorded more than 8 times the safe level in the Delhi air
 yah sthiti 1 din main nahin bani he 12 din ho chuke hai jab se rajdhani kii hawa itani jahrili hui he
 Who is responsible, Center or Delhi? Now the question arises whether Central and State Government did not know about this situation or they did not have any means to know that the air of Delhi is going to be so poisonous
 iskaa sidhaa jawaab yah he ki modi sarkaar or kejariwal kii sarkaar ko is baat kii jaankaree sarkari agenciyaan lagaataar de rahi thi
 Talking about the central government, they had information coming from the Meteorological Department as well as forecasts from the Central Pollution Control Board
 iske alaava mausam vibhaag ke envyranment divijan ke safar program ke tahat is sthiti ke liye lagaataar purvanumaan jari kiye jate rahe hai jo ek had tak sateek baithe hai
 On the other hand, the Kejriwal government of Delhi had forecasts from the Delhi Pollution Control Board and forecasts from the Meteorological Department, but these forecasts were not given any consideration
 mausam vibhaag kii chetavanee ko samajhanen main naakaam rahi sarkarein26 oktober ko american spes agency nasa ne bharat ke maidani ilaako main dhan ke kheton main lagaai ja rahi aag ko lekar ek tasviir jari kii or isse yah spasht hua ki is baar bhi pichley har saal kii tarah punjab se uthne vaala dhooaan uttar bharat main apana rang dikhayega
 Meteorological Department scientists had an idea of how the weather is going to be in all the areas of North India including Delhi in the coming days
 mausam vibhaag ko aamtaur par 15 dinon ke bare main sateek jaankaree hoti he or is baat ko centre sarkaar ke saath-saath rajya sarkaar bhi jaanati he
 But the government has failed to understand the severity of the weather like every time
 mausam ke har parameter is baat kii taraf ishaara kar rahe the kii deepawali ke aasapaas rajdhani main vaayu pradooshan main jabardast ijapha hone ja rahaa he
 Despite all this, this central government agency did not issue any warning to the people to take precautions, the Meteorological Department has put a warning of 3 days on the travel website under the travel program of its environment division
 mausam vibhaag ne is baat kii jarurat hi nahin samajhi ki itani khatarnaak sthiti ko akhabaaron or tivi main vigyaapan dekar logon ko aagaah kiya jaae
 That is, those people who are mandated to inform the people of the country about the dangers related to the weather in advance, they did not fulfill this responsibility properly
 soti rahe punjab va kendra sarkareincendre sarkaar ne kya kadam uthaae satellite se mil rahi khet jalaane kii tasveeron ke baavjood dilli main baithi modi sarkaar or punjab main baithi badal sarkaar soti rahi
 Like Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who cursed the central government in talk, Modi and Badal Sarkar failed to understand the seriousness of the matter
 deepawali ke baad jab dilli ensiaar ke tamaam ilaakon main smog condishan ban gai to sabko yahi laga kii kuch dinon kii baat he deepawali kaa pradooshan he jald chalaa jayega
 But this did not happen that would not happen, the meteorological department was fully aware of this
 lekin naa kisi sarkari mahakme ne unase poocha naa hi unhone is baat kii jahamat uthaai ki vah kisi prashasnic amale ko alert karte, sab kuch ram bharose chalata rahaa
 Environment Minister convened a meeting of secretaries
 When this situation started getting out of control, the news of the media started coming suddenly, the sleeping government woke up, then the Union Environment Ministry called a meeting with the secretaries of Delhi and its surrounding states
 meeting main dhai ghante se zyada vichaar kiya gaya tamaam muddon par baatcheet kii gai baahar nikalakar paryaavaran sachiv e ke jha ne jaankaree di har tareeke ke mudde par baatcheet kii gai he or is baatcheet main nikal kar aayaa he ki pichley saal smog ke vakt jin 42 binduon par dilli-ensiaarake rajyon main aapas main sahmati bani thi un sabko lagu karwaane main rajya sarkaron ne hi laahvaali kii he
 Due to increased pollution in Delhi NCR, the Central Government asked the Central Pollution Control Board to check the factories of the 17 most polluting industries
 iske alaava badarpur thermal power plant se failane vaale pradooshan par dilli sarkaar se baat kii rajya sarkaron se yah bhi kaha gaya ki vah paryaavaran se sambandhit tamaam niyamon or kanoonon ko sakhti se paalan karavaaen
 That is, it can be said that for a serious problem, it was just like a government meeting
 NGT ke dabaav main uthaae gaye kadamudhar engiti ke dabaav or pradooshan par much rahe ho halle ke bich dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ne antat kai kadam anand fanan main uthaa liye
 The situation even went so far that the infamous Kejriwal did not leave any stone unturned to curse the central government in every matter, while talking to journalists, he also mentioned the possibility of artificial rain over the capital Delhi and asked the central government for this will talk
 samaj main nahin aata he yah kisi sarkaar he or inako salaah dene vaale kaise log hai kaaman sens yah kahata he kii kritrim barish karaane ke liye kam se kam badalon kii jarurat padegi hi lekin bin badal barsaat karaane ke liye kejariwal yojana banane lage hai unako koun samajhaae ki yah monsoon ke baad kaa sijan he or isamen barish western disturbance ke chalate hi hoti he or aise main jab dilli ke upar anti cyclone sarkulation bana hua ho to us jagah par badal hi nahin banate hai, kejariwal sarkaar bhi sthiti kii gambhirtha kaa andaja lagane main naakaam rahi he
 The condition of governments is very bad, but who will issue a warning that such high pollution level is medical emergency
 punjab chunaav bhi he samanepunjab main aane vaale dinon main vidhansabha chunaav hone ja rahe hai or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal punjab main apane voton kii fasal kaatane kii taiyaari kar rahe hai
 In such a situation, how can he blame the farmers of Punjab for the pollution of Delhi
 lihaaja tamaam aise kadam uthaae ja rahe hai jinase dilli kaa badha hua pradooshan jaldi kam nahin ho saktaa he udhar centre sarkaar ke paryaavaran mantri dilli ensiaar ke rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon se mili or vaayu pradooshan ko kam karne ke liye tamaam kadamon par charchaa kii
 But even in this meeting, no pressure was put on Punjab to stop its farmers from setting fire to the fields
 maamla yahaan bhi punjab ke agle vidhansabha chunaavon main voton kii fasal kaa he
 In such a situation, there is no other option but to change the seasonal conditions
 hawaaon kaa rukh badal rahaa he or pradooshan main kami aa rahi he lekin ye abhi bhi sef level se kaaphi upar hai
