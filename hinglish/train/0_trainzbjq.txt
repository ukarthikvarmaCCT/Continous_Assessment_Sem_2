 The Kannauj parliamentary seat is one of the strongest seats of the Samajwadi Party in the current era

 Despite the Modi wave in 2014, the BJP could not feed Lotus here
 raja jayachand ke daur main kabhi uttar bharat kii rajdhani rahaa kannauj aajkal uttar pradesh kii raajnneeti kaa centrebindu he
 The people of Kannauj, who have been with the Congress hand for several decades, have been riding a bicycle for the last 21 years
 ek baar samaajawaadee party ne dimple yadav ko yahaan se ummidavaar banaaya he
 However, Akhilesh Yadav had earlier said that Dimple would not contest the election, after which he had talked about contesting from here
 kannauj ke teen saansad siemakannauj se loksabhaa chunaav jitkar saansad banane vaale teen kaddavar netaa mukhyamantri bane
 Sheila Dixit, who became MP in 1994, was the Chief Minister of Delhi three times, while Mulayam Singh Yadav, who won in the nineties in 1999 and Akhilesh Yadav, elected in the early 21st century, was the Chief Minister of UP

 1999 main sapa ke tatkaaleen mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav jite, lekin unhone baad main istipha de diya
 After this, Akhilesh Yadav started his political innings with the by-election in Kannauj parliamentary seat in 2000
 iske baad akhilesh yadav ne 2004, 2009 main lagaataar jeet kar unhone pehali baar hetric lagaakar itihaas rachaa, lekin 2012 main upi ke siem banane ke baad unhone istipha de diya

 agar ausat bhartiya ek ausat chini naagarik kii tulana main 30 pratishat zyada amir hota to kya hota? sabase pehle to bharat kii prati vyakti aay maujuuda 1,500 dollar salanaa kii bajaae 8,500 dollar hoti
 This would have made India the second largest economy in the world at around $ 8 trillion
 agar garibon ko maujuuda halaat se ubaarane main aksham rahe khaadya suraksha vidheyak or manaregaa jaise lok lubhaavan kaarykram na hote to kya hota?agar bharat main duniya kaa sabase bada express-ve network, prachur maatra main sasti bijli or badhibia bandargah hote to kya hota? ye sab kisi arthshaastri ke dimag ke fitur nahin hai
 This reminds us that most Indians are either ignorant of a fact or have forgotten it which is real rather than imagined
 bharat main 1991 main aarthik sudhaar kii prakriya shuru hone se 10 varsh se bhi kam samay pehle yani 1982 tak bharat kii prati vyakti aay china kii tulana main 30 pratishat adhik thi
 According to World Bank data, the average Indian's annual income in 1982 was $ 279, while an average Chinese citizen earned just $ 201 a year, 28 percent less than an Indian
 aaj china kii prati vyakti aay bharat kii tulana main 309 pratishat adhik he
 The price we are paying to live in a country that refuses to grow, is not just an example of lack of wealth
 aazaadee ke samay prati vyakti aay ke maamle main bharat or dakshin korea kaa str ek samaan tha
 Today South Korea's income is 1,400 percent more than the average Indian income
 unki aamadani main ijapha yun hi nahin hua he
 For this, the government there made policies to promote industries
 misaal ke taur par, hundai motor company kii sthapana 1967 main kii gai, or yah kiya motors ke saath hundai motors group ke naam se jaani jaati he
 Tata Motors has been operating in India long before this, but today Hyundai is the fourth largest car manufacturer in the world
 1970 tak dakshin purv asian desh indonesia kaa jidipi bharat se kam tha, lekin aaj 39 pratishat adhik he
 The list of countries overtaking India in terms of prosperity and GDP is increasing at a very fast pace
 in pannon par die graphics se saaf jaahir he ki duniya main aisi arthvyavasthaaon kii bharmaar he jo kabhi bharat se peeche thim or aaj aage hai
 That is why our finance minister is also surprised that why businessmen of India are choosing to invest abroad
 unke saamne ek badi chunauti yah he ki bharat ko nivesh ke aakarshak centre ke rup main videshi niveshkon ke saamne kaise rakhaa jaae
 Indian industrialists are buying companies worldwide
 iske liye ve bade paimaane par videsh main nivesh kar rahe hai, lekin bharat main nivesh se kataraa rahe hai
 Obviously our policies are flawed
 itane varshon main kshamta se kam pradarshan kii keemat itani badi ho gai he ki ham lakshanon ko kaaran maanane kii bhul karne lage hai
 Low per capita income, poor roads and end-to-end poverty are all a result of India being a country afraid of development
 isaki vajah yah he ki desh pradarshan or sambhaavna ke bich kii lagaataar badi or chaudee hoti khai ko paatane se inkaar karata rahaa he
 Its symptoms have been appearing for decades
 1970 ke dashak main sust vruddhi dar jaisi baaten, jab (vaastavik arthon main jidipi vruddhi sirf 3 pratishat salanaa thi), 1990 ke dashak main sudhaaron ke prati narsingh raav kii madhya margi niti or endie tathaa upie sarkaron ke gathbandhan dharm ke jhuthe bahaane, sabake sab desh ko sust banane ko uchit tehraane ke hatkande hai
 Who can make India a developed country? The answer is the leader and this answer is not very encouraging
 lekin yah kaam jitna kathin dikhataa he, utana he nahin
 They can start by just changing the words of their promises and slogans
 garibi kam karne ke vaade kii bajaay agar aamadani doguni karne kaa vaada karen to kaisaa rahegaa? japan duniya kii pehali chamatkaari arthvyavastha he
 He had defeated India long before China
 usne aamadani badhaane or uske jariye garibi ghataane kaa sankalp liya
 In 1961, Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda promised that by the end of the decade, Japan's family income would double
 ikeda ke japan ne sirf saat saal main yah lakshya hasil kar liya
 In India, the poor-minded stance of leaders often turns anti-middle class
 nattejey main daulat paidaa hone kii bajaay garibi kaa vitaran hota he
 Such a change in thinking, it would not be a fantasy to get a high per capita income from China

 Singh is no longer the king in the public eye
 mushkil ye he ki congress ke paas koi doosraa acha vikalp nahin
 Rahul Gandhi is a favorite of the people but he himself is not ready to take the responsibility of the Prime Minister

 logon se jab poocha gaya ki kya congress netaaon par ghotaalon ke aarope lagane se pradhanmantri kii chhavi kharaab hui he to 70 fisadi logon ne haa kaha
 The problem is that most people blame the Prime Minister for the current situation
 india today or nilsan kii survey main ye bhi pataa chalaa he ki anna hajaare kaa andolan or baba ramdev ke satyagrah ke saath hue bartaav ne bhi congress ko gahari chot pahunchaai he

 All decisions taken by the Aam Aadmi Party government in the last year and a half are now under questions
 hai court kaa faisla aane ke baad uparajyapal najeeb jang ne ek cameti banaakar dilli sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kii 400 filein jaanchane kaa silsilaa shuru kiya tha
 At present, the Aam Aadmi Party has asked LG 5 questions, objecting to the way the committee was formed and investigated
 aam aadmi party ke netaashutoshne shanivaar ko ek press conference ke dauraan alji najeeb jang par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 Ashutosh said that the elected government told through a cabinet meeting that lg's Shunglu Committee is unconstitutional and the way LG is threatening officials and showing government files to outsiders is wrong
 haal hi main alji daftar se 400 file ke maamle main ek chuni hui sarkaar ko dhamkee di gai he
 Comparing LG Najeeb Jung with Viceroy, Ashutosh said that if the matter of rights is in the Supreme Court, then its decision will be there
 lekin alji kii taraf se jis tarah kaa bhashaa kaa istemaal ho rahaa he wo galat he
 LG is talking like a BJP spokesperson
 dilli kii chuni hui sarkaar ko sibiai kii dhamkee di ja rahi he, lekin aam aadmi party andolankaaree hai ye police or sibiai se nahin darati
 The Aam Aadmi Party has asked 5 questions to Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung about the Shunglu Committee investigating the 400 files of Kejriwal government
 alji bataaencenvidhanke kis praavdhaan or kanoon kii kis dhara ke tahat cameti ko 400 file jaanchane kaa adhikaar diya?2
 Not so much lg's status, but he is running a suppression cycle at the behest of Modi
 alji bataaen kis netaa ke kehane par cameti kaa gathan kiya?3
 Not every person can see the government file
 gaiyrkanoonee kaam alji kyon kar rahe hai?4
 Officers are called by calling the Shunglu Committee
 kis adhikaar or kanoon ke tahat cameti adhikariyon ko bula rahi he?5
 Threatening calls are being made to the officials not to show the file to the ministers
 alji sahab jawaab den?aam aadmi party ne alji najeeb jang par ghotaale main shaamil hone kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Ashutosh alleged that when the LG was a joint secretary in the Petroleum Ministry, the Panna Mukta scam case reached the CBI and the LG had to resign
 iske alaava alji kii bhoomika sienji fitness scham main jaanch na karaane main bhi he
 Do not threaten the LG Aam Aadmi Party trapped in the scam itself

 President Asif Ali Zardari has said that PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif has turned down his appeal to meet, although he played a key role in saving the former prime minister from hanging during the regime of military ruler Pervez Musharraf
 aagaamee aam chunaav ke liye pakistan pipuls party kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene ke liye is samay lahore main deraa daale jaradaari ne sharif se unke bhai abbaas sharif kii maut par shok jataane ke liye mulaakaat kerani chaahi thi

 jaradaari ne daawa kiya he ki unhone sharif ko purv raashtrapati musharraf dwaara faansee par chadaaye jane se bachaaya tha
 He said that after Sharif was imprisoned by Musharraf after the removal of the PML-N government through a military coup in 1999, he had 'friendship' with Sharif
 jaradaari ne daawa kiya, us samay musharraf nyaayadhish rahamat hossain jaafaree par sharif ko kadi sajaa die jane kaa dabaav daal rahe the
 a newspaper quoted Zardari as saying that i had some acquaintance with Judge Jafri and when i heard that Musharraf was pressurizing Nawaz to be sentenced, i advised him to settle the case on merits
 unhone kaha ki vah jaafaree ko sharif ko kadi sajaa nahin die jane ke liye manaane main safal ho gaye

 monsoon satr main mahatvapurn vidhaayi kaamkaaj main vivaadaaspad asainya parmaanu javabdehi vidheyak tathaa nyaayik maapdand or javabdehi vidheyak pramukh hai lekin mahila aarakshan vidheyak ko lekar abhi bhi asamanjas kii sthiti bani hui he jise rajyasabha kaaphi pehle manjuur kar chuki he
 The Communal Violence Prohibition Bill also occupies a prominent place in the government's agenda
 is vidheyak par sonia gandhi kii aguwai vaali rashtriya salaahkaar parishad vichaar vimarsh kar chuki he
 This is also the condition of the bill to increase the 33 percent reservation of women in local units to 50 percent
 is bich, sanyukt sansadeey samiti dwaara sifarish kiye jane ke baad saansadon ke vetan bhatton main vruddhi karne ke liye ek masauda vidheyak taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The committee had recommended increasing the salary of mps from Rs 16,000 per month to 80,001
 yah vetan kendra sarkaar ke sachiv ke vetan se ek rupaya adhik he
 The last increase in salary allowances of 545 Lok Sabha and 250 Rajya Sabha mps was done about ten years ago
 sarkari karmchaariyon ke liye chatha vetan ayog janvari 2006 se prabhaav main aayaa tha
 The committee headed by Charan Das Mahant of Congress has also recommended increasing the daily allowance of mps from Rs one thousand to Rs two thousand per month during the ongoing Parliament session

 The objective of the Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill is to set judicial standards and to establish a mechanism to deal with complaints of 'behavior or incompetence' of a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court

 gandhi balidaan diwas, 30 janvari par ek baar phir desh apane shaheedon ko yaad karegaa
 Rajghat becomes the center of many programs taking place on this day
 yahaan raashtrapati mahoday thik 10 bajkar 58 minute par gandhi samadhi par ek vishesh phool maala chadhaate hai
 Then three contingents of all the three parts of the army reverse their weapons
 sena ke bigulawadak apane bigul par 'lost post' naamak dhun bajaakar puure desh main do minute kaa maun prarambh hone kaa sanket dete hai
 The army cannon reports this silence
 or sab jagah to shaayad nahin, par gandhi samadhi par to sab kuch tham jaataa he
 The sling of the chains of slavery is not enough
 in zanjeeron ko ham itane saare varshon kii aazaadee ke baad bhi hataanaa nahin chaahate
 These chains of slavery are very gorgeous! Every part, every part of our Martyr's Day ceremony, is filled with British military symbols
 aazaadee kii ladaai main shahid hue logon ke sapanom se ye pratik bilkul mail nahin khate
 These symbols reflect the magnificence of those who fought against them, the military tradition of the British
 yah ghinauna kaam or kahin bhi hota to chal jaataa, par yah to hota he gandhi samadhi par
 On his tomb, which had no connection with weapons, guns, army and British customs, methods
 duniya bhar main ahimsa kaa pratik ban gai is samadhi, rajghat par hamaari sena ke teenon angon se chunakar banaai gai teen tukadiyon kaa pravesh hota he
 All the devotees take off shoes at this place, but on this day the soldiers of the three troops enter here with their shining shoes
 iske baad kaa sara samaaroh britani sena kii un vishisht paramparaon se mandit hota he, jo unke hisaab se thik hi rahi hongi
 But do not be surprised if you suddenly hear the favorite hymn of Gandhiji 'raghupati Raghav Raja Ram' in the middle
 yah is bhavy maane gaye kaarykram kaa mul hissaa nahin tha
 It was made much later and perhaps very reluctantly as part of that program
 gandhiji ke priy bhajan gaae jane lagate hai
 Information about the arrival of the President is received
 unka pravesh hota he samadhi par to bhajan gayan kaa swar dhimaa padane lagata he
 The completion of bhajan is also not necessary
 bas yah to raashtrapati ke aagaman tak samay bitaane, vakt kaatane kaa ek sundar tarika bana liya gaya he
 Now the President pays a wreath
 yah shraddhasuman desi yaa ganvaaru dhang se arpit nahin kiye jate
 In Europe, in England what is called 'reith' has been adopted here from the very beginning
 ek bade gol aakaar main saje phulon kii maala
 Usually it is made by decorating fresh flowers on tires
 phir bajataa he bigul
 The tune of 'lost Post'
 isi shok dhun se britani fouj apane shaheedon ko yaad karti aa rahi he
 This is followed by a two-minute silence
 yah maun shradhanjali bhi hamaari parampara kaa ansh nahin he
 And not even eleven o'clock
 aisa bataaya jaataa he ki pratham mahayuddh ke baad san 1918 ko thik gyaarah baje yuddh viraam sandhi par dastakhat hue the
 This time has been chosen in the event of Martyr's Day
 shaheedon kii yaad main do minute ke maun main apni gulaami kii zanjeeron ko jor-jor se bajaane vaala yah samaaroh san 1953 se shuru hua tha
 Earlier, Martyrs' Day was celebrated four times on January 30 at Gandhi Samadhi with great simplicity, but with great reverence
 un dinon samadhi bhi bahut hi sidhi-saadi thi
 Neither was black marble plastered on it like today, nor did Amar Jyoti, who wastes gas for twenty-four hours, burn there
 san 1951 main sansad ne 'rajghat samadhi adhinium' paarit kiya tha
 a committee was formed under the then Ministry of Housing (now Urban Development) for the maintenance, maintenance of mausoleum
 bas isi ke baad shuru hua tha yah bhavy samaaroh jo tab se aaj tak baraabar duharaaya jaataa he
 The chairman of this committee is often appointed by some senior Gandhian, but the rest of the work is done in its own way
 san 1970 main pehali baar sansad ke tees sadasyon ne acharya krupalani, madhu limaye or samar guha ke netritv main is shahid diwas samaaroh main bhari padi britani rasmon kaa virodh kiya tha or saarvajanik rup se bayaan aadi dekar isaki ninda kii thi
 Some members of the Rajghat committee also supported him in this
 aisa nahin tha ki sarkaar ne itane bade or itani badi sankhya main aage aae sansad sadasyon kii baat ko gambhirtha se nahin liya tha
 But then January 30 was about to come
 sarkaar ne apni majaburi bataai
 Said that there is so little time left, no fundamental change can be brought in it
 sansad sadsy bhi udaar hriday vaale the
 Were patient
 is tarah san 1971 kaa samaaroh jyon kaa tyon manaaya gaya
 After that even this work could not be done the next year
 tab to sarkaar ke paas vakt kii koi kami nahin thi, ichha kii kami jarur rahi hogi
 Therefore, in the ceremony of 1972, the original form of the ceremony remained as it was in the British tradition
 bas gandhiji ke kuch priy bhajan jarur jod die gaye the
 That too, where the presence of hymns on the original program is not known
 tab rakshaamantri se is bare main poocha gaya tha ki yah sab badal kyon nahin paa rahaa? unka uttar tha : 'sarkaar ne sabhi virdohi dalon kii raay le lee he
 'that is, at least in the case of British copying, the distance between our ruling party and opposition parties was reduced
 san 1973 se lekar 1976 tak sattarudh dal or virdohi dal or bhi jaruri kaamon main vyast rahe honge
 Then came 1977
 virdohi dal hi satta main aa gaya
 Some thought that this ceremony would change, but it did not happen
 ab kab hoga? Superstar Shah Rukh Khan said that he keeps distance from social media because of negativity
 shahrukh ne soshal mediaper charchit ek live video main phans se aagrah kiya ki vah soshal media par gaali-galoch na karen
 Asked why are you keeping away from Twitter? The actor said that he wants to keep a distance from Twitter, as he does not like to read idiotic things
 shahrukh ne kaha,'main twitor par aana pasand nahin karata, mujhe gaali-galoch karne vaale log pasand nahin hai
 i don't think i need to open the telephone to see negativity, so i don't like it
 vahaan kai murkhtapurna or bekaar kii baaten hai, isliye mujhe ise padhane kii jarurat nahin or main ise padhanaa pasand nahin karata
 Shahrukh urged everyone to refrain from such things on social media and go to the fact, because there is no fun in it, if you want to call someone bad, then you say it in front of him

 unke gale main rudraksh kii teen maalaaen padi hai
 His open right palm has an Om on it, and his eyes are sharp
 patrika kaa sheershak hi sab bayaan kar detaa haih 'hastrekha vidya ke madhyam se swayan ko pahachaanie
 'his magazine's emphasis is more on the palms than on palmistry (long nails are a sign of simplicity, small intelligence) but he has to keep doing something for the sake of his art
 unhone pej number 31 par apni pustak kii safalataa kii bhavishyavaanee kii he; or india today (angreji) main unki pustak kii pehle hi samiksha kii ja rahi he
 This is fame
 kisi guruji ke aakarshan ko kamatar aankna aasaan hota he
 In every religion, in every era, there have been sly people, who have used religion as their way to gain credibility first and finally popularity
 aap chahen gerua vastra pahanen yaa dadhi rakhen, is tarah kii lokapriyata or dhan-daulat ke bich kaa faasla kaaphi kam hota he
 Ironically, the possibility of a religion being used as a tool of manipulation lies at its center: it cannot be tied to the banks of the argument
 beja dakhsandaji karne vaale, dhoort logon ne dharm kii sansthaaon, chaahe vah mandir ho, masjid ho, gurudwara ho yaa carch, ko niyamit rup se shikaar banaaya he
 They specialize in hypnotizing people with the promise of supernatural rewards
 vishwaas kii vistrut shrenee ke lacheelepan, or paaramparik vyavhaar ke kanoonon se uski duuri aise paatro ke liye jameen taiyaar karti he jinka mukhya uddeshy seva karne kii bajaae thagna he
 The power of those who preach around us is evident; His teachings hold hope, creating an experiential protective shield against man's most common illness of helplessness, or the loud slaps of his close relative, Noumidi
 lekin kya kisi dharmik thag ko jail main shrota mil sakate hai?jail siddhanthata dante (kii divine kamedi) kaa narak haih isamen pravesh karne vaale tum sab ummid kaa daaman chhod do
 Jail is the last stage
 aap jaanate hai ki aap bheetar hai, or ek calendar se hi pataa chalata he ki aap baahar kab niklenge
 There are no miracles inside the prison walls
 vidambnaa hi he ki tihaad ke adhiktar kaidiyon ne uske daraavne daravaajon ko langhane se kaaphi pehle hi ummid kaa daaman chhod diya he
 Tihar is a stigma for India, not because of the newly arrived guests but because of its ordinary prisoners: 92 per cent of them are people living below the poverty line
 40 fisadi se zyada kaidi to puri tarah nirakshar hai
 Most prisoners between the ages of 18 and 21 have arrived there without any luggage, even a couple without clothes
 unhone kabhi saamaanya shauchalay kaa prayog nahin kiya
 These are such abandoned children, abandoned by their family and country long ago; The children of Delhi who we learned how to ignore while driving a car, are the wreckage of a hungry metropolis straining national resources for a never-ending hunger for development
 ye garib paidaaishi mujrim nahin hai
 Life has not given much choice to most of them
 yah vidambnaa hi he ki tihaad ke garib, sajayaftaa kaidiyon ko jail aazaadee se zyada sabhy lagati he
 There is sure to be two-time bread and there is also a possibility of getting work
 tihaad ke karawas mahanideshak, mridubhashi niraj kumaar ne tihaad main sudhaar kaa ek aisa mahatvapurn kaarykram chalaaya he jisase apradhi ko narmadil banaakar aparaadh kam karne kii koshish kii jaati he
 The finest linen shirt (I have worn the same shirt while writing it) is made in Tihar and a variety of products are produced, which are controlled by professional consultants
 lekin tihaad desh kii duusari jelon se utani hi dur he jitani dilli baaki bharat se shreshth he
 The European Karl Marx believed that religion is the poppy of the people
 jatiyon main bante bharat main sadiyon tak opium logon kaa dharm thi
 Today's Guruji people have prepared a miraculous medicine: they sell both in the same mixture
 desh or duniya ke itihaas main 21 may kai kaarnon darj he, jinamein se se bharat ke purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii hatya mahatvapurn he

 However, Asim Riaz takes the name of Paras Chhabra, and thus finally the majority comes to the name of Paras Chhabra and Mahira Sharma to go to jail

 The onion is just an example, the prices of all essential commodities are skyrocketing one by one
 ab to iskar chhaapon ke khilaaf nasik ke pyaaj kaarobaariyon ne do dinon ke hadtaal kaa bhi elaan kar diya
 That is, the public's trouble will increase and the opposition's attack on the government will intensify
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki keemten aakhir bekaabu kaise ho gayi
 After all, whom should the general public ask, what is his fault which he is facing so much inflation
 sarkaar main baithe kuch log to yahaan tak kah rahe hai ki mahangaai kam karne kii sarkaar kii bhi ek had he, uske baad sarkaar kuch nahin kar sakati
 On the other hand, the central government keeps blaming the state governments for the rising inflation, while the states fully blame the Center for this
 netaaon kii is siyasat main agar koi pis rahaa he to wo he aam aadmi
 Whatever may be the reason for rising inflation, but governments cannot escape their responsibility

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi lashed out at the Congress in Alwar, Rajasthan

 The dance starts as soon as the sun sets, the amazing dance starts after dusk and the moon comes out

 People of Jasnath sect claim that they do not feel jealous of walking or dancing on coals due to the blessings of the Guru
 in daavon main kitni sachai he ye to vigyaan kii kasuti par parakhane se hi janaa ja saktaa he
 But it is faith that gives the people of Jasnath sect the power to forget all and dance on the coals

 With the support of the CBI, its former director Ranjit Sinha on Monday alleged in the Supreme Court that Prashant Bhushan had accused him 'at the behest of anyone'
 ranjit sinha ne kaha ki ek ‘chipa hua haath’ vakil prashanth bhushan ke ‘dimag ko niyantrit kar rahaa he’, jinhone unke khilaapkoyalakhdaan aabantan maamle kii jaanch main kathith rup se hastkshep karne or jaanch prabhavit karne ko lekar kai aarope lagaae the
 Ranjit Sinha, in an affidavit, denied the allegations and called them 'untrustworthy'
 unhone kaha ki gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kaaman kaaj ke vakil prashanth bhushan apni nijee khunnas nikaal rahe hai or is maamle ko khatm kar dena chahie, kyonki isse santhaan ko nuksaan hi nahin ho rahaa he, balki yah use hatotsahit bhi kar rahi he
 He was replying to allegations leveled by the NGO regarding the entries of the coal scam accused in the visitor register at Sinha's residence
 sinha kii ore se varisht adhivaktaa vikaas singh ne in aaropon ko bakawaas qaraar dete hue kaha ki apane aaropon ke samarthan main bhushan dwaara pesh file kii tippaniyan sheersh adaalat ke 2013 or 2014 ke do adeshon kaa ulanghan he, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki is maamle se sambandhit koi bhi dastavej kisi ke saath bhi saajha nahin kiya jayega or aisi sthiti main yah uske hi aadesh kaa hi ulanghan nahin balki sarkari gopneeyata kanoon kaa bhi ulanghan he
 Taking recourse to the cbi's statement, Sinha's counsel also said that as the head of the investigating agency, Sinha never ignored the unanimous opinion of his subordinate officers on the question of legal proceedings
 unhone kaha ki is tathy kii jaanch honi chahie ki mumbai sthit akhbaar ne unke nivas ke register kii pravishthiyon kaa vivaran kaise prakashit kiya or kaise yah khabar likhi ki bhushan ise sheersh adaalat main pesh karne ja rahe hai, jabaki unhone khud hi sweekaar kiya ki yah khabar prakashit hone se pehle hi shaam ko ek visil blor ne unhen ye dastavej saunpe the
 Before a three-member bench headed by Justice Madan b Lokur, Singh said, 'there is a hidden hand in it
 bhushan or udyog jagat se yaa anyatra kisi vyakti ke saath bhushan ke vichaar milte the
 Someone is controlling their mind
 ' singh ne iske saath hi sawaal uthaaya ki bhushan ne sheersh adaalat se bhi us visil blor kii pahchaan ujagar karne se kyon inkaar kiya jo silband lipaphe main yah chahta tha
 He said that what is in this diary can be considered completely true
 unhone kaha ki bhushan aise vyakti hai jo sochate hai ki vah kanoon se upar hai or yahaan tak ki sheersh adaalat ke nyaayadhishon par bhi vishwaas nahin karte hai
 He and CBI Special Advocate Amarendra Sharan said that Sinha has admitted to meeting some of the accused, as meeting all the people was part of his job but not as Bhushan has alleged that he was dealing with 80-90 persons
 Meet and many of these meetings are midnight
 isamen us samay kii mulaakat ke bare main pravishthiyaan hai jab vah desh ke baahar the
 Sharan was also ready to submit the comments filed by the CBI in a sealed envelope to Bhushan on the condition that his confidentiality be maintained

 haalanki sabhi 5 adhikariyon ko baad main chhod diya gaya
 Amidst this highvoltage drama, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee reached the house of Commissioner Rajiv Kumar
 unhone kaha ki sibiai kii siyaasi istemaal ho rahaa he
 This is a politics of vengeance
 unhone kaha ki piem narendra modi ke ishaare par enese ajit dobhaal ise anjaam de rahe hai
 If there is evidence against the police commissioner, it should be presented
 mamata ne kaha ki chitfund ghotaalaa bahut chota he
 It is my duty to protect my officers
 aisi harkaton se ham darenge nahin
 At the same time, in this case, the same Trinamool Congress MP Derek o'brien has raised the question by tweeting whether the BJP is preparing for the coup by sending 40 CBI officers? Let us tell you that the CBI is looking for Rajeev Kumar (rajeev Kumar) in connection with the cases of Rose Valley and Saradha Chit Fund Ghotala and as a last resort, the Police Commissioner should also be arrested
 Can
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki in ghotaalon kii jaanch ke liye pashchim bengal police dwaara gathit esaiti kii aguwai kar chuke ipies adhikari kumaar se gaayab dastavejon or filon ke babat poochtacha kerani he, lekin unhone jaanch agency ke samaksh pesh hone ke liye jari noticeon kaa koi jawaab nahin diya he
 When the CBI team reached Kumar's residence, he was stopped outside by the personnel and sentries stationed there
 kolkata police ke adhikariyon kii ek team sibiai adhikariyon se baatcheet ke liye maukey par pahunchi or yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii ki kya unke paas kumaar se poochtacha karne ke liye jaruri dastavej the
 It is worth mentioning that Rajeev Kumar, a 1989 batch IPS officer of West Bengal cadre, did not participate in the meeting with Election Commission officials who had come to Kolkata recently to review the election preparations
 ravivaar ko kolkata police ne ek bayaan jari kar un khabaron ko sire se khaarij kiya tha ki kumaar duty se gaayab hai
 Police said, 'please note that Kolkata Police Commissioner is not only available in the city but also coming to office on regular basis

 The Chief Minister of the state, Adityanath Yogi, does not want to be unilaterally convinced of the fight on the political board of the state, despite breaking the alliance between the two major political parties Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party of Uttar Pradesh
 ve vipakshi ekta main foot kaa phayda uthaane or phir se maidan maarane nikal pade hai kyonki unki sarkaar banane ke baad upi main hue upachunaavon ke nattejey kaaphi kadave anubhav lekar aae the, jahaan se vipakshi ekta kii buniyaad padi thi
 Yogis want to fix the nail thorns ahead of the by-elections on the seats vacated after the 12 mlas of the state were elected to the Lok Sabha
 isaki shuruyaat unhone shanivaar ko saharanpur se kii or kareeb 20 ghante tak yahaan mandal mukhyalay par deraa daale rahe
 He named Sunday as Moradabad
 afasaron se unhone vikaas or kanoon vyavastha par baat kii, lekin bhaajapa ke jimmedaaron se gangoh or rampur main upachunaav kii taiyaariyon par khaas charchaa kii
 Both seats are very important for CM Yogi
 gangoh seat saharanpur jile main he, lekin shamali jile kii kairana loksabhaa seat main aati he or bhaajapa ke pradeep choudhary ne kairana se saansad nirvaachit hone ke baad chodi he
 The by-election was held in Kairana a year before the demise of MP Babu Hukum Singh
 sapa, basapa, ralod or congress ke aghoshit gathbandhan se rashtriya lokdal ke simbel par swargeey munwwar hasan kii patni tabassum hasan ne hukum singh kii beti bhaajapa kii mriganka singh ko chunaav haraaya tha
 But this time she lost to BJP after fighting SP-BSP and rld's declared alliance on SP symbol
 darasal kairana loksabhaa seat kii paanch main se do nakud or gangoh vidhansabha siten saharanpur jile main aati hai or congress in par duusare number kii party rahi he
 In 2017, Imran Masood of Congress from Nakur and his twin brother Noman Masood from Gangoh stood second
 upachunaav main yahi do siten kairana main bhaajapa kii haar kaa kaaran bani thim
 That is why in the recently concluded Lok Sabha elections, CM Yogi had made a gesture of polarizing Imran Masood as 'azhar Masood's son-in-law'
 rampur vidhansabha seat sapa ke fire brands netaa ajam khan ke saansad nirvaachit hone ke baad istife se rikt hui he, jo muradabad mandal ke antargat aati he
 Azam Khan is constantly on the target of the Yogi government regarding Johar University
 jaahir he ki mukhyamantri ne un mandalon ko sthaliy samiksha ke liye pehle chunaa he jahaan kii vidhansabha siton par upachunaav hone hai
 These include Gangoh (saharanpur), Iglas (aligarh), Rampur, Pratapgarh, Govindnagar (kanpur), Tundla (firozabad), Cantt (lucknow), Zaidpur (barabanki), Manikpur (chitrakoot), Balha (bahraich), Jalalpur (ambedkar Nagar) and We are Hamirpur
 rampur se espi or jalalpur se bispi ke vidhayak saansad chune gaye hai, jabaki baaki par bhaajapa ke vidhayak nirvaachit hue hai
 The by-election experience for the BJP has not been better
 yogi ke mukhyamantri banane ke baad gorakhpur, phulpur, kairana loksabhaa or nurpur vidhansabha upachunaav bhaajapa haar gai thi jabaki chaaron siten aam chunaav main bhaajapa jiti thi
 The BJP is taking the challenge of a by-election at the level of government and organization just like the general election
 bhaajapa ke saamne ek chunauti yah bhi he ki saansad banane vaale uske kuch vidhayak apni siton par rishtedaaron ko chunaav ladaana chaahate hai
 But the party and the state government are in a mood to fight the dedicated workers
 sifarish ke aadhaar par kamjor ummidavaaron kii haar hoti he to iske liye rajya sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa karne main der nahin lagegi, is baat ko yogi bhi mahasoos kar rahe hai or sanghathan bhi
 Therefore, an exercise to win the war against weak opposition has been started at both levels
 dauron par nikalne se pehle yogi ne lakhanu sthit apane siem awaas par kor group kii baithak main bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh da
 Discussed with Mahendra Nath Pandey and Organization General Secretary Sunil Bansal
 11 siton kii jimmedaari ek-ek mantri ko di gai he or haari hui seat jalalpur jeetne ke liye do mantri jimmedaar banaae gaye hai
 Among them are the seats of Satyadev Pachauri, Rita Bahuguna Joshi and SP Singh Baghel, who were ministers in the Yogi government
 inamen das siten bhaajapa ke kabje main raheen hai
 In the 2017 assembly elections, SP candidate Azam Khan from Rampur and BSP candidate Ritesh Pandey won the Jalalpur Assembly seat despite a raging Modi wave
 aise main sarkaar or sanghathan in siton par khaas kaaryayojna ke tahat chunavi mod main hai
 Issues and caste equations in these seats have also been taken into account in giving responsibility to ministers and leaders
 rampur seat kii jimmedaari up mukhyamantri dinesh sharma ko jimmedaari saunpi he, vahiin jalalpur (ambedkarnagar) seat jeetne ke liye mantri brajesh pathak or santosh singh ko lagaaya gaya he
 Deputy CM Keshav Maurya has been given to Govindnagar, Minister Shrikant Sharma to Tundla, Ashutosh Tandon to Lucknow Cantt, Dara Singh Chauhan to Zaidpur, Ramapati Shastri to Balha, and Pratapgarh to Transport Minister Swatantra Dev Singh
 isi tarah mahendra singh ko manikpur, bhupendra singh ko gangoh, dhunni singh ko hamirpur jitaane ke liye lagaaya he
 Although bjp's Western Uttar Pradesh spokesperson Gajendra Chaudhary does not consider cm's visit as an electoral exercise, he says, "the purpose of the review is not to conduct elections, but to speed up administrative investigations and development work
" chunaav main to hamaare mukaable koi he hi nahin
 However, says the senior vice president of the UP Congress Committee, Imran Masood, "before the by-election, the BJP has been agitated and the misuse of the government machinery is being carried out for fear of losing
" janata sab jaanati he ki media or vipakshi janpratinidhiyon se duuri banaakar kya samiksha hoti he?”haalanki aise aaropon kaa ahsaas hote hi khud mukhyamantri adityanath yogi ne muradabad ravaanaa hone se pehle hi saharanpur main subah saadhe aath baje hi media ko bulaakar baatcheet kii
 By the end of July, he claimed investment of Rs 75 thousand crore and creation of five lakh new jobs in the state
 unhone kaha, “majboot kanoon vyavastha or vikaas kaaryon kii gunvattta banaae rakhan ke liye ek maah main 18 mandalon main samiksha kii jaaegi
 Negligent officers have been instructed and action will be taken
 ”vipakshi dal bhale hi ise bhi upachunaav kii ghoshnaa se jodakar dekhen, lekin yah bhi sach he ki sapa or basapa jaise pramukh dal to aapasi ladaai main ulajhakar philhal pratikriya dene kii takat bhi nahin juta paa rahe hai
 Here, instead of considering the weak opposition as a basis for victory, bjp's state government and the government have started fixing their loose nails
 yah pehla mauka rahaa jab soobe ke mukhyamantri ne gorakhpur ke alaava saharanpur main raatri pravaas kiya
 Now, the matter of not giving preference to the officers and leaders of the action on the officers by the senior officers in front of CM Adityanath Yogi in Saharanpur and Moradabad was effectively raised by the BJP leaders and directly linked the defeat in the Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat, but the elder officer He is blamed for this, he is a close relative of a prominent leader of the state BJP

 Delhi BJP spokesperson Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga is currently taking the responsibility of responding to Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in his party and in his own way
 dilli main jahaan chunaavon se pehle arvind kejariwal or unki party lagaataar iviem sawaal uthaa rahi he aise main bijepi ne 3 farvari 2015 kaa arvind kejariwal kaa ek twit phir se ritvit karte hue kaha he ki iviem par arvind kejariwal tab bhi kharaab hone kaa aarope laga rahe the or gadabadiyon kii ashank jataa rahe the
 Then Arvind Kejriwal had alleged in his tweet that only bjp's light was running on pressing any button in a machine on the seat of Delhi Cantt i
e
 only BJP was getting votes
 ullekhneey he ki is chunaav main matganana ke baad dilli vidhansabha kii 70 siton main se 67 par aam aadmi party ke pratyaashee hi jite the or dilli main aitihaasik jeet ke saath party kii sarkaar bani thi
 The party had swept the Congress that had run the government in Delhi for 15 years and had defeated the BJP in such a way that it was reduced to only three seats
 bijepi bhi itane mat pratishat hasil nahin kar pai thi ki netaa vipaksh kaa pad mili, lekin dilli kii aam aadmi party kii sarkaar or arvind kejariwal ne netaa vipaksh kaa pad bijepi ko dene kaa faisla kiya tha
 Now Delhi BJP spokesperson Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga has said in a tweet that even earlier Arvind Kejriwal has been making the issue of evms
 or kaha ki agar kejariwal jeet jate hai to kehete hai ki hamaara kamaal or agar haar gaye to aarope lagaate hai ki iviem kharaab he

 But you won 67 / 70 seats

 unhone kaha ki agar arvind kejariwal 2015 main haar jate to bahaanaa banaate
 Then they would have said that we had already said that there is a problem in evms
 vahiin bagga ne kaha ki varanasi main haarane ke baad kejariwal ne kaha tha ki 3 lakh vot farji hai
 If you lose, then you insult democracy
 yah arvind kejariwal kii aadat he
 In Delhi, where Arvind Kejriwal and his party are constantly raising EVM questions before the elections, the BJP has retweeted a tweet of 3 February 2015 by Arvind Kejriwal, saying that evms are still being accused of being spoiled by Arvind Kejriwal And were anticipating disturbances
 tab arvind kejariwal ne apane twit main aarope lagaaya tha ki dilli kaint kii seat par ek mashin main koi bhi batan dabaane par keval bijepi kii hi lite chal rahi thi yani keval bijepi ko hi vot ja rahe the
 It is noteworthy that after the counting of votes in this election, the Aam Aadmi Party candidates won 67 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly and the party was formed with a historic victory in Delhi
 party ne 15 saalon tak dilli main sarkaar chalaane vaali congress ko supada saaf kar diya tha or bijepi ko aisi patkhni di thi ki vah keval teen seat par simat ke rah gai thi
 The BJP too could not get such a vote percentage that the leader gets the post of opposition, but Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party government and Arvind Kejriwal had decided to give the post of leader opposition to the BJP
 ab dilli bijepi ke pravaktaa tejinder paal singh bagga ne ek twit kar kaha he ki pehle bhi arvind kejariwal iviem kaa mudda banaate rahe hai
 And said that if Kejriwal wins then he says that our awesome and if lost, then accuse that EVM is bad

 Panipat Box Office Collection Day 1: bollywood actor arjuna kapur (arjun Kapoor) or kriti senon (kriti Sanon) kii film 'panipat' (panipat) cinemagharon main relies ho gai he
 Critics have also given good response to this film
 film ko lekar darshakon main bhi utsaah he
 However, the film did not do much at the box office on day one
 arjuna kapur kii film ko karthik aryan (kartik Aaryan) kii 'pati patni or wo' ne kadi takkar di
 According to Box Office India
com, Arjun Kapoor's film 'panipat' (panipat Box Office Collection) only 3 on the first day
 5 se 4 karod rupee kaa collection kiya he
 Pati Patni Aur Woh Box Office Collection Day 1: Karthik Aryan's film made a big hit at the box office on the first day, earned so many crores vahiin, arjuna kapur (arjun Kapoor) or sanjay dutt (sanjay Dutt) ne is film main kamaal kaa abhinay kiya he
 This is the first time the two actors are together in a film
 ashutosh goarikar (ashutosh Gowariker) ne bhi lambey samay baad is film ke saath vaapasi kii he
 Earlier, Ashutosh Gowariker had urged people to watch it before making any concept about his upcoming film Panipat
 bhangada paa le' kii relies date ai saamne, to yah actor shahrukh-salmaan ke bangale ke baahar laga chillane- dekhen Video'panipat' kaa trailor (panipat Trailer) relies hote hi vivaad ho gaya tha
 To this Ashutosh had said, "I think people need to see the film
 film ko dekhne ke baad unhen unke saare sawaalon ke jawaab mil jaaenge
 When they see the film, then they will be able to feel that it is made with good intentions and the film has all the good things
 " is film main arjuna kapur marathi yoddha bane hai
 While Kriti Sanon is the wife of Arjun Kapoor in the film, Sanjay Dutt is seen as an enemy of Arjun Kapoor in the character of 'ahmed Shah Abdali'
 paanch rajyon main ho rahe vidhansabha chunaav ke liye congress jis tarah pratyaashiyon kaa chayan kar rahi he, usase yah saaf hota ja rahaa he ki yah party upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa 'van main sho' sabit ho saktaa he
 This is the first time in the history of the party when the leader of Rahul Gandhi's stature is finalizing one ticket each
 sutron kii maane, to rahul gandhi ne sabhi rajyon ke liye pehle se hi apane logon se survey karakar rakh liya tha
 When the party president or the state Congress brings their panel or candidate for the ticket, Rahul matches that name with the name of his secret survey
 agar ye naam unki list se mail khaataa he, tabhi naam paas hota he
 If not, the name is called again
 sutron kii maane, to chhattisgarh ke liye ab tak jari sabhi 17 naamon main se zyaadaatar yuva chehre hai or ye aise netaa hai jinako lekar pradesh netritv bahut utsahit nahin tha
 But Rahul decided to give tickets to these people
 sutron kii maane, to jab chhattisgarh ke pradesh congress adhyaksh charandas mahant suchi lekar baithak main pahunche to unhen rahul ke kade or sidhe sawaalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 a leader present in the meeting told, 'although there were many people present there, but only Rahul ji was asking questions and Mahant was answering in some way
 ’maamla sirf chhattisgarh kaa nahin he
 Delhi's Chief Minister Sheila Dixit is also unable to finalize the list of candidates because many names in her list do not match the list of Rahul Gandhi
 rahul kii is mustaidi kaa hi asar he ki madhya pradesh main sab bade netaa ek manch par dikh rahe hai or pratyaashee kaa naam badhaane se pehle 10 baar soch rahe hai
 Strong leaders like Digivjay Singh have distanced themselves from ticket distribution
 pehle daagi netaaon sambandhi adhyadesh ko puri dabangai se khaarij karana or uske baad vidhansabha chunaavon ko puri tarah apane haath main lenaa
 These are two recent incidents that are breaking the traditional image of Rahul Gandhi
 ab tak yahi mana jaataa rahaa he ki rahul gandhi sakriy raajnneeti main badi jimmedaari nibhaane se bidakate rahe hai, lekin ab to lagata he ki vah nai li banane kii taiyaari main hai

 Nevertheless i kept trying to fulfill my dream of playing for Pakistan
 ' Ali was displaced in his childhood from Jaka Khel, a small village in the terrorism-affected Swat Valley
 yah vahi ilaaka he jahaan nobel puraskaar jeetne vaali saamaajik kaaryakarta malala yusafajai kaa bhi ghar he
 Ali's family was displaced along with those who had migrated from here after stringent Sharia law came into force after the Islamic fundamentalists ruled the region
 unke parivaar ne karachi ke audyogic kshetra main apana thikaana banaaya
 Ali started working as a child laborer here for only 150 rupees a day after his father's death in childhood
 ali ne kaha, 've bahut mushkil bare din the
 We came to Karachi in search of peace and security and as a family member it was more important for me than playing money
 ' Ali recalled, 'I requested my boss that i be given work in the night shift, so that i could play cricket during the day and he accepted it
 ' After a long struggle, Ali was selected in the Pakistani team for the Under-19 World Cup held in Sri Lanka in 2006
 colombo ke premdasa stadium main is vishwa cap ke final main unhone apni bananaa-swing bowling se 35 ran dekar bharat ke paanch wicket jatke or pakistan ko junior vishwa champion bana diya
 In this, Pakistan had a target of just 109 runs in front of India and dismissed India for 71 runs

 yadi ve isi se mehnat jari rakhte hai, to ve hamaare mukhya olerounder honge
 ' anwar ali ne haal hi ke srilanka daure main shandaar pradarshan karke pakistani team main apni jagah pakki kar lee he
 Ali is confident that he will be able to perform the same against every opposing team
 haal hi main hue srilanka tour ke duusare tii-20 main colombo main ali ne 17 gendon main 46 ran banaae, jisamen chaar gaganchumbi chakke or teen chauke shaamil the
 With this innings, he made a place in the minds of fans like Pakistan's charismatic all-rounder Shahid Afridi
 27 saal ke ali ne AFP se kaha, 'allaah kaa shukr he ki main yah uplabdhi hasil kar sakaa
 He added, "at one time my life was going through a very difficult phase, because i used to work in a company that made socks for my livelihood

 The court has acquitted all the accused, including former ministers a Raja and Kanimozhi, in the 2G spectrum case, the country's biggest scam
 court ne apane faisle main kaha ki sarkari vakil yah sabit nahin kar paae ki do pakshon ke bich paise kaa len dein hua tha
 The court's ruling proved true to the principle of senior advocate and former telecom minister, Mr Sibalaki, in which he spoke of 'zero loss' or 'no revenue loss'
 us vakt sibbal ne kaha tha ki 2gspektrama ghotaale main kisi tarah kaa len dein nahin hua tha
 Neither did the government suffer any revenue loss

 He alleged that "1,76,000 lakh crore rupees have been lost to the government by spectrum sold by Raja
" "haalanki, court ke faisle ke baad vinod raay ke aarope galat sabit hue
 Now the Congress is taking on the BJP and the then CAG chief Vinod Rai from the road to the House
 sibbal ne saadhaa vinod raay par nishaanaa
 
 
 After the court's decision, Kapil Sibal targeted Vinod Rai
 unhone kaha, 'tatkaaleen kaig vinod raay ne sajeesh kii thi
 When i spoke about zero loss, i was strongly criticized by the then opposition
 ab court ne meri baat par muhar laga di to vinod raay ke paas ab kehane ko kuch nahin bachaa

 Many Puranas have been said about the marriage of Lord Shiva and Mother Parvati
 ye us samay kaa sabase bhavy vivaah tha
 The story that is most prevalent about their marriage, we tell you the same
 
 
 yahaan hua tha shiv-gauri kaa vivaah
 
 
 Gods, demons, humans had all arrived at the wedding It is said that apart from the gods, asuras and humans, ghosts, gana etc
 were present in this marriage
 is shaadi main bade se bade or chote se chote log shaamil hue the
 Shiva is called Pashupati, so all animals, insects and animals came to attend his wedding
 yahaan tak ki bhoot-pishaach or veikshipt bhi mehmaan bane
 For the long life of the husband, do these 5 things on the day of Shivratri, a grand wedding of a princess, because Parvati was the daughter of the king, so it was a grand wedding
 us samay is shaadi ke liye aise intjaam kiye gaye the jo pehle kabhi nahin hue the
 In this auspicious time in Maha Shivaratri, Lord Shiva became silent on the occasion of the worshipers
 At that time it was the custom that at the time of marriage, the lineage of both bride and groom was declared
 parvati kii vanshavali kaa bakhaan kiya gaya
 Then it was Shiva's turn
 samasya ye thi ki shiv ke mata-pita, rishtedaar yaa parivaar kaa koi ata-pataa tha nahin
 When Parvati's father requested Lord Shiva to tell him something about his family, Shiva sat silently while looking somewhere in the void
 kaaphi der tak anunay-vinay karne ke baad bhi ve nahin bole
 This is the way to worship Shiva on Mahashivaratri, if you want to do everything you want, then Munarada did Narada Muni there
 unhone kaah, shiv ke mata-pita nahin hai, inkaa koi gotra nahin he, inke paas apane khud ke alaava kuch nahin he
 Because they are self-proclaimed

 Around 7 on Thursday morning
 30 baje suraj kii kirnon ne abhi pair pasaara hi tha ki uma bharti rajnath singh ke ghar pahunch gayi
 It is speculated that the BJP president entrusted Uma Bharti as the messenger between senior leader LK Advani and the party
 kareeb 11 baj rahe honge jab uma bharti- bijepi ke purv adhyaksh nitin gadakari ke ghar pahunch gayi
 There was a conversation between the two leaders for about forty minutes
 gadakari se mulaakaat ke baad uma sidhe adwani ke ghar pahunchi
 Advani was present at home
 kareeb aadhe ghante donon netaaon ke bich baatcheet hui
 Interestingly, after meeting Advani, Uma again reached the house of former BJP president Nitin Gadkari
 duusari baar uma or gadakari ke bich mulaakaat kareeb aadhe ghante chali
 Before forming the government, there is tension about Advani's role in BJP
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki adwani se baat karne kii jimmedaari sushamaa swaraj ke kandhon par daali gai thi lekin jab baat nahin bani to ye jimmedaari uma bharti ko saunpi gai
 Actually, before forming the government, the BJP wants to decide what role Advani wants for himself
 party unhen loksabhaa spikar yaa enesi jaise kisi cameti kaa chairman bananaa chaahati he
 But Advani is not opening his cards
 is bich sangh or bijepi ke bich sethu kaa role nibhaa rahe gadakari ke ghar par duusare netaaon kaa bhi aana janaa laga rahaa
 At that time, the needle of the clock must be telling the time of around 11 am when Varun reached the house of the former BJP president
 donon netaaon ke bich kya baat hui ye nahin kaha ja saktaa lekin kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki varun nai sarkaar main apane liye jagah kii khwaahish lekar party or sangh ke bich sethu kaa kaam kar rahe gadakari ke ghar pahunche the
 The period of commotion and interactions has increased
 lekin nai sarkaar kii tasviren chand ghante baad hi saaf ho paaengi- jab loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey aaenge

 janata party ke adhyaksh subramanyam swami ne shuukravaar ko india against karpshan (iasi) ke kaaryakarta arvind kejariwal ke kiye gaye khulaason ke bare main kaha ki isamen kuch nayaa nahin he
 Subramanian Swamy said that Kejriwal, who has entered politics from social service, has adopted a hopeless approach
 kejariwal ke aaropon par swami ne kaha, 'unka (kejariwal) najariya bilkul saaf he, yah mere nazariye jaisaa hi he
 But they want to form public opinion about this system that it cannot be done
 mere paas is samasya ke samaadhaan kaa sakaaratmak tarika he
 But Kejriwal is adopting a hopeless way that all people are the same in this system
 unka maananaa he ki sabhi ekasaath hai or iskaa kuch samaadhaan nahin nikal paaegaa
 However, he once again reiterated that there is nothing new in Kejriwal's allegations and everything is already in the Supreme Court records
 unhone congress or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke khilaaf kuch bhi naa bolne ke liye kejariwal ko aade haathon liya
 Regarding President Pranab Mukherjee, Swamy said, 'everyone knows how corrupt Pranab Mukherjee is
 pranab kis tarah se dhirubhai ambani or mukesh ambani ko salaam thokate the ye sabhi jaanate hai
 Talking about Kejriwal's negative approach, Swamy said, "kejriwal has said that Aruna Roy is his mentor

 She has also lived in Sonia Gandhi's National Advisory Council, and i still do not know about it
 'swami ne kaha, 'kejariwal ke aaropon main kuch bhi nayaa nahin tha

 Raja Ram Pandey, a former minister of Uttar Pradesh and three-time MLA from Vishwanathganj seat in Pratapgarh, died of a heart attack late on Thursday
 raja ram kii maut ke baad upi mantrimandal kaa vistaar taal diya gaya he
 Raja Ram Pandey was dismissed from the post of Khadi and Village Industries Development Minister in Akhilesh government on 15 April this year
 58 varshiya mantri ji ne ek mahila iees adhikari kii khubsuurati ko lekar vivaadaaspad tippanee de di thi or iske alaava apane bayaan main hema malini ke gaalon kaa bhi zikr kar diya tha
 After which he was dismissed
 khabaron ke mutabik beete kuch dinon se raja ram pandey behad tanaav main the
 After the death of Raja Ram, the extension of UP cabinet has been postponed
 shuukravaar ko akhilesh yadav apane mantrimandal kaa chauthi baar vistaar karne ja rahe the
 But sources had informed Raja Ram Pandey that he was not being given a place in the cabinet expansion this time, due to which Raja Ram Pandey was very disappointed
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar raja ram pandey ko pataa chal chukaa tha ki wo cabinet main shaamil nahin kiye jaaenge
 For this reason Raja Ram Pandey was in shock
 isi sadame kii vajah se unhen guuruuvaar kii raat dil kaa daura padaa
 He was rushed to hospital immediately after his health deteriorated
 lekin aspataal pahunchane se pehle hi unki maut ho gai
 Controversial statement of Raja Ram Pandey
 
 
 12 april 2013 ko raja ram pandey ne pratapgarh main kaha tha, 'bela kii sadaken hema malini ke gaal kii tarah chamakengi abhi to isaki facial ho rahi he
 There was a lot of ruckus about this statement
 aisa nahin tha ki raja ram pandey ke kisi bayaan par pehali baar vivaad khadaa hua ho
 Earlier, he had also praised the beauty of the District Magistrate of Sultanpur district during a function as Minister in charge
 raja ram pandey ne tab kaha tha, 'yah meraa saubhaahgya he ki main duusari baar is jile kaa prabharee mantri bana hum
 i have a chance to work with a beautiful DM here every time
 jab maine jile kii purv dm kamini chouhan ratan ko dekha, to laga ki unase khubasurat mahila ho hi nahin sakati he
 But this new DM (dhanalakshmi) is even more beautiful than him
 inke baat karne kaa lahaza bhi behatar he
 ' aam taur par netaaon ko sach bolne ke liye nahin janaa jaataa
 But independent candidate Gopal Dhakad from agra-south seat has a different style
 'bevakoof banaaungaa, paisa kamaungaa'dhakad sach or eemaandaaree kii kasame nahin khate
 He says that the way Modi has cheated 125 crore people, he will also win elections by fooling the people
 dhakad kii raay main raajnneeti aaj kii taarikh main ek kaarobaar he or baaki netaaon kii tarah wo bhi jeetne ke baad paisa banaaenge
 'be a leader, remove unemployment' is also a sharp arrow against demonetisation in the quiver of fraud
 unke mutabik cash kii kami ne vyapaar ko chaupat kar diya he
 So every youth should make a career in politics
 unka daawa he ki ye berogari dur karne kaa sabase acha tarika he
 This unique candidate has no qualms in saying that if he wins the election, he will leave no stone unturned to rob the public
 unki maane to agra main ab tak chune gaye netaaon ne yahi kiya he
 Privacy in government is both dangerous and necessary

 Governments argue that under certain circumstances it is their duty to hide the truth, even lie
 ham samaj sakate hai
 We also understand how this privilege is misused
 misaal ke taur par jang ke dinon main har mulk jhooth bolne ke adhikaron kii seemaa ko kaaphi lacheela bana letaa he
 But even in the passion of patriotism, we forgive the exodus of a warrior but punish for the mistakes of the rumor-maker about the war
 iraq ke yuddh main ghaseet laane ke liye apane-apane mulkon se jhooth bolne vaale jorge bush or toni blair ne jo jakhm paae hai, ve unke jite-ji to nahin pur vaale
 Dr
 manmohan singh kii sarkaar kisi or se nahin balki apane se hi yuddh lard rahi he
 But a malicious kind of civil war seems to promote censorship
 isane artiai par jaan-bujhkar ek khuli bahes shuru kii he
 However, through all the tips, it aims to bring such amendments through which access to documents will not be as easy
 nijee taur par yah prashasan maan chukaa he ki artiai kushti kii ek licency jang main tabdeel ho chuki he
 Why? Then the right question for this would be ‘why now?’ RTI Dr
 singh kii upaj nahin he lekin ve is kanoon ke abhibhavak hone kaa daawa kar sakate hai
 In the campaign for the 2009 general elections, he counted it among his significant achievements and helped him get some additional votes
 dow
 Singh had no problem with RTI in the first term
 duusare kaarykaal ke do saal ke bheetar hi vah aakhir kaise unke liye samasya ban gai? artiai kii karypranali koi atirikt udaar to hui nahin he
 However, its workers have become smarter and smarter
 upie 1 main artiai ko lekar garvonmad or upie 2 main uske prati ghabrahat kaa fark saaf he
 Before 2009, Dr
 singh ko lagata tha ki unke paas chhipaane ko kuch bhi nahin
 As if the revelations at the industrial level of the misdeeds of his ministers, his confidence was fueled
 khud ke hi khaae jakhmon se vishwasaneeyata taar-taar ho gai or sabase zyada chot artiai ne pahunchaai
 Corruption was at the root of these wounds, which made them canker
 rashtramandal khel or 2ji spectrum bhrashtachar ke deshvyapee pratik ban gaye
 In both cases, the files received from ITI not only busted but also left no possibility of being exposed
 sarkarein jab record durust karne kii baat karti hai to vahaan ek sawaal khadaa hona chahieh record gadabad kisne kiya tha? artiai se pehle tathyon ke todmarod ke liye media par dosha madhnaa aasaan tha
 When copies of the original files began to come into hand, the voices of those who raised their voices against them seemed to be more authentic than the half-baked explanations of the ministers
 hamaari sansadeey pranali main jhooth ko lekar badi baarik drushti se kaam liya jaataa haih sadan main jhooth bolte pakade gaye kisi mantri se istife kii ummid kii jaati he par sach se kanni kaat sakane vaale mantriyon ko chaalaak or sakasham maan liya gaya
 RTI did not leave any such scope for ministers

 In Singh's government, all the symptoms of 'secondary dermatitis' are visible: a waste disease which can be fatal

 shanti ke jis dharaatal par khadey hokar unhone apane antarrashtriya vyaktitv kaa nirmaan kiya tha vah china ke morche par 1959 tak tootna shuru ho chukaa tha or 1962 kii jang main to puraa dhwast ho gaya
 Mrs
 Indira Gandhi's case seems to be an exception at first sight
 1971 main unke duusare kaarykaal kii shuruyaat tak kuch bhi gadabad nahin hui
 But by 1973, nothing remained right
 1980 se 1984 ke bich main unka teesraa kaarykaal galatiyon or hinsa ke gubaar main ghumdta rahaa or isaki samaapti unki shahadat ke saath hi hui
 Re-elected governments falter between high public expectations and complacent attitude
 ve is bhram main bharosa karne lagati hai ki vipaksh khatm ho gaya
 Nothing dies in a democracy
 loktantr main saarvajanik jivan ke kai myne hote hai; iskaa arth saarvajanik maamalon kaa prabandhan hi nahin balki is prakriya main jan prabandhan bhi he
 The umbrella of privacy works only on certain topics like defense
 shashan ke duusare vishyon main to yah sirf bahaanaa he, samaadhaan nahin or bahaane samayik vinimay dar par bahut zyada vakt nahin kharid pate
