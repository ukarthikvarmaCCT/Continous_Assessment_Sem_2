 The way has been cleared to develop the National Dinosaur Fossil Park in the nearby Dhar district to save at least six crore years old 'jurassic treasures' scattered in the Narmada Valley of Madhya Pradesh for the coming generations
 yah ahm pariyojna dhan aavanton ke abhaav ke chalate lambe vakt se filon main uljhi thi
 a senior official of the forest department said that the state government has allocated Rs 77 lakh in the first phase to develop a national dinosaur fossil garden on about 89 hectares in Padalya area of tribal-dominated Dhar district
 is pariyojna ko lekar gajet adhisuchana bhi jari kar di gayi he
 He said that to develop the National Dinosaur Fossil Park some 150 km from here, it would cost an estimated cost of about three crore rupees and it would take at least three years
 varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki is udyaan kii vistrut pariyojna report (deepiar) banane kaa kaam kisi visheshgy sanstha ko saunpa jaayegaa
 In this project, the help of prestigious Birbal Sahni Puranaspati Science Institute of Lucknow will also be taken

 Vishal Verma, the lead researcher of the organization, said, 'in the past, there have been reports of smuggling of dinosaur fossils from Dhar district
 rashtriya dianosor jeevashm udyaan ke ban jane se in anmol jeevashmon ko bachaaya ja sakegaa
 In addition, the sites where dinosaurs once came to increase their lineage could also be preserved

 However, today it is very difficult to believe that the present Narmada valley once had a dinosaur sultanate
 verma ke mutabik yah baat kam se kam chah karod saal pehle kii he
 He said that most of the fossils found in Dhar district belong to dinosaurs of the Sauropod family, which were 20 to 30 feet in height

 The PDP also said that it is committed to removing the disputed Military Forces Privilege Act (AFSPA), which the BJP may not accept

 He said that no compromise can be reached with the party's stand on Article 370 security
 ' At the same time, PDP has the next option to accept the support of Congress Party with 12 mlas and National Conference with 15 mlas
 vah in donon dalon ke saath sampark main he, kyonki vah bhaajapa se haath milaane ko lekar duvidha main he

 The accused escaped from there

 Where doctors barely saved her life
 police ko soochna di gai
 Then it was revealed that Tina's husband Arvind had stabbed her in the stomach 8 days ago
 police ne maamla darj kar chaanbin shuru kar di he
 During this time, the police came to know that the accused Arvind suspected his wife Tina
 use lagata he ki tina ke kisi anya mahila ke saath sambandh he
 He used to point fingers at Tina's character
 isi ke chalate hi usne 8 din pehle bhi tina par jaanaleva hamalaa kiya tha
 According to police, Arvind and Tina were married 7 years ago
 unke do bachche hai
 His family lives in the Ashapuri Society of Pandesara
 jaan bakhshana unka pesha he, lekin hindustan main doctoron ko khud jaan kaa jokhim uthaakar kaam karnaa padataa he

 Victims of attacks on these occasions: The results of this research by Doctor IMA show that the greatest risk of attack on doctors and other medical staff is during the hours of the visit
 aise halaat aksar immergency ke dauraan yaa marijon kii surgery ke baad bhi pesh aate hai
 Dean of the International Institute of Health Management and Research 'aggravating Violence' said AK Agarwal, 'violence has been taking place against people associated with the medical profession for more than a decade
 lekin pichley kuch saalon main aise maamalon kii taadaad chintajanak halaat tak pahunch gai he
 Patients often abusive with medical personnel or resorted to physical violence
 aisi vaaradaaten saal-dar-saal puure desh main bad rahi hai
 Agarwal was speaking at a seminar on the subject in Delhi on Saturday
 'marijon or doctoron ke bich bharose kii kami'agarwal ke mutabik doctoron or marijon ke bich bharose kii kami behad chintaa kii baat he
 He said that the lack of communication qualities and lack of human compassion among medical personnel is also responsible for this situation

 No air service is available from anywhere in the state except the capital Dehradun
 yahaan audyogic vikaas ke liye uttarakhand rajya audyogic vikaas nigam limited (sidkul) kii sthapana hui, jiske baad udhamsingh nagar ke rudrapur, kashipur, pantnagar ke saath hi haridwar ke bahadarabad or dehradun ke selakui main audyogic kshetron kii sthapana kii gai
 Famous industrialists Tata and Bajaj also invested in industrial units in Pantnagar, Rudrapur and Kashipur
 is kshetra main bahari niveshkon kii 1,000 se zyada audyogic ikaiyaan hai, lekin iske baavjood hawaii seva bilkul jarjar he
 For the expansion of air services in the state, four airstrips were built in Jollygrant (dehradun), Pantnagar (udham Singh Nagar), Nainisaini airstrip (pithoragarh) and Gauchar (rudraprayag), but on the runway of all the three airports except Dehradun's Jollygrant Airport Children are riding bicycles and cattle are grazing grass
 pantnagar airport se do baar niyamit udaanon kii koshish ho chuki he, par kabhi safal nahin hui
 The situation is that industrialists investing capital in Pantnagar, Rudrapur and Kashipur areas feel cheated
 yaa to unhen nijee vimaan kiraye par lekar yahaan aana padataa he yaa sadak maarg se kahin zyada samay kharch karnaa padataa he
 After the establishment of SIDCUL and industrialization in the Terai, Jagsen Airlines started its services from Pantnagar Airport in 2005 on the initiative of Narayanadatta Tiwari, the then Congress government chief

 For this service, the state government was also giving a subsidy of 9 seats to the company

 There was one daily flight to Delhi from here, which was more than 80 per cent of the average daily ride
 ab keval vahi log yahaan se udaan bharte hai jo nijee vimaan lekar aate hai
 Industrialists who have set up industries in the Terai are also angry due to the closure of air services from Pantnagar
 kumau gadhwal chembar of commers ke adhyaksh darbara singh kehete hai ki aaj ke jamaane main bina connactivity ke deveopment ke bare main sochna bekaar he
 The customer is a passenger to start the airline from the Terai
 uske baad bhi is kshetra kaa yah durbhaagya he
 He says that the previous state government could not agree the DGCA and the Airport Authority in this matter
 ab nai sarkaar ko is bare main pahal kerani hogi, nahin to rajya main ho rahe puunji nivesh par bhi jaldi hi iskaa bahut bura asar najar aayega
 Apart from Zauligrant and Pantnagar, two airstrips in the state have been built at Nainisaini in Pithoragarh and Gauchar in Rudraprayag district
 donon hi vistaar kii baat joh rahi hai
 The 1,500-meter Pithoragarh airstrip is suitable for landing small aircraft

 rajesh kumaar ke mutabik, jaldi hi hawaii pattee ke vistaar kaa kaam shuru kiya jayega
 In Pithoragarh too, the politics of expansion of air services did not diminish
 is baar ke vidhansabha chunaav se thik pehle november, 2011 main tatkaaleen cabinet mantri or sthaneey vidhayak prakaash pant ne ek 22 seater vimaan hawaii pattee par utarkar daawa kiya tha ki pithauragarh main hawaii sevaayen agle maheene se shuru ho jaaengi
 The aircraft landed on the runway just before the election belonged to a private company
 darasal vot bank banane ke liye aisa kiya gaya
 However, this 22 seater aircraft could not cross the minister's boat and he lost his election
 yahi haal gauchar main bani hawaii pattee kaa bhi he
 The government has never been serious about starting services from here, while private companies like Pawan Hans and Prabhatam are providing useful service to the people by making the pilgrimage to Chardham from here
 rajya gathan ke 11 saal main uttarakhand main teesri nirvaachit sarkaar ban gai he
 During this time, BJP and Congress have enjoyed alternating power in the state, but no initiative was taken by any government for the expansion of air services

 Whereas, Iran said the US accusation is false
 khadi desh arab hauthi vidrohiyon ko sainya or aarthik madad kar rahaa he
 Whereas, the charge is being leveled against Iran

 There are many punches behind the arrest of alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav in Pakistan
 pakistan iske zarie na sirf bharat par pakistan main jasusi, baluchistan main hinsa failaane ke aarope kii pushti karne kii koshish kar rahaa he, balki kahin na kahin iraan par bhi dabaav banane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 The matter is also economic and is directly related to the strategic needs of Pakistan, India, Iran, Saudi Arabia and China
 pakistan ke guadar bandargah ko china kii madad se banaaya gaya he or ise 30 hazaar karod rupye kii laagat par china-pakistan iconomic coridor ke taur par badhaayaa ja rahaa he, lekin iske paas hi bharat kii madad se chabahaar bandargah bhi banaaya ja rahaa he
 Iran's poorest province, sistan-balochistan Province, is now trying to develop the government of Iran, so the Chabahar Free trade-industrial Zone has also been created there
 chabahaar, behad bheed bhaad vaale street of hormuz se baahar he or oman kii khadi se hote hue hind mahaasaagar se judaa he
 That is, if China has Gwadar, then India has Chabahar
 ek baar yah kaam puraa ho jaataa he to bharat samudr ke raste, bina pakistan ke bich main aae, sidhaa afghanistan se jud jayega
 This will make the supply of gas and energy extremely easy
 saaf he ki bharat ke liye yah aarthik or ranneetik donon lihaaz se behad ahm he
 It is no less important for Iran too
 uske liye sistan-baluchistan kaa vikaas karnaa vahaan chal rahe ugravad par kaabo paane kaa ek tarika he
 Actually, this area of iran is located in Balochistan area of pakistan
 pakistan ke baluchistan main pehle hi algaavvaadi sakriy hai
 At the same time, they are also supported by militants in Balochistan, Iran
 iraan or pakistan ne 2014 main inase nibatane ke liye ek duusare kaa saath dene kaa samjhauta kiya he, lekin iraan kai baar pakistan par in ugravadiyon kii madad kaa aarope laga chukaa he
 In such a situation, the arrest of the alleged Indian spy, the time of declaration of arrest, the statements from Pakistan and Iran, point to a different picture
 ek najar daalate hai in halaat or bayanon par
 It is believed that the alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav was in the possession of Pakistani agencies, months before his arrest was announced

 Even the army spokesman had expressed concern about Raw's use of Iran's land

 India says that this man does business from Chabahar area of iran and has raised suspicions of abducting him to Pakistan
 is sabake bich khabaren yah bhi aa rahi hai ki iraan ab jadhav chabahaar main kya kar rahaa tha, uske kaarobaar kaa galat istemaal to nahin ho rahaa tha or agar galat istemaal ho rahaa tha to kya use isaki jaankaree thi, in sab chizon kii jaanch karegaa
 Clearly, Iran neither wants to spoil relations with India nor Pakistan, but does not want to come under pressure from Pakistan either
 lekin nishchit taur par vah pakistan ke is aarope kii bhi jaanch karnaa chahega ki chabahaar kaa istemaal ro to nahin kar rahi
 At present, India is waiting for the consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav, ie the permission of the diplomats present in the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to meet him
 pakistan ke guadar bandargah ko china kii madad se banaaya gaya he or ise 30 hazaar karod rupye kii laagat par china-pakistan iconomic coridor ke taur par badhaayaa ja rahaa he, lekin iske paas hi bharat kii madad se chabahaar bandargah bhi banaaya ja rahaa he
 Iran's poorest province, sistan-balochistan Province, is now trying to develop the government of Iran, so the Chabahar Free trade-industrial Zone has also been created there
 chabahaar, behad bheed bhaad vaale street of hormuz se baahar he or oman kii khadi se hote hue hind mahaasaagar se judaa he
 That is, if China has Gwadar, then India has Chabahar
 ek baar yah kaam puraa ho jaataa he to bharat samudr ke raste, bina pakistan ke bich main aae, sidhaa afghanistan se jud jayega
 This will make the supply of gas and energy extremely easy
 saaf he ki bharat ke liye yah aarthik or ranneetik donon lihaaz se behad ahm he
 It is no less important for Iran too
 uske liye sistan-baluchistan kaa vikaas karnaa vahaan chal rahe ugravad par kaabo paane kaa ek tarika he
 Actually, this area of iran is located in Balochistan area of pakistan
 pakistan ke baluchistan main pehle hi algaavvaadi sakriy hai
 At the same time, they are also supported by militants in Balochistan, Iran
 iraan or pakistan ne 2014 main inase nibatane ke liye ek duusare kaa saath dene kaa samjhauta kiya he, lekin iraan kai baar pakistan par in ugravadiyon kii madad kaa aarope laga chukaa he
 In such a situation, the arrest of the alleged Indian spy, the time of declaration of arrest, the statements from Pakistan and Iran, point to a different picture
 ek najar daalate hai in halaat or bayanon par
 It is believed that the alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav was in the possession of Pakistani agencies, months before his arrest was announced
 aise main pakistani sena ne isaki giraftaar kaa elaan thik us vakt kiya jab na sirf pakistan kii Joint Investigation Team (sanyukt jaanch dal) bharat main pathankot hamale kii jaanch ke liye pahunchi thi, balki iraan ke raashtrapati hasan ruhani bhi islamabad main the

 At present, India is waiting for the consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav, ie the permission of the diplomats present in the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to meet him
 iraan ke liye bhi yah koi kam ahm nahin
 For him, the development of sistan-balochistan is a way of overcoming the insurgency going on there
 asal main iraan kaa yah ilaaka pakistan ke baluchistan ilaake se laga hua he
 Already separatists are active in Balochistan, Pakistan
 saath hi inkaa samarthan iraan ke baluchistan main ugravadiyon ko bhi miltaa he
 Iran and Pakistan have entered into an agreement to support each other to deal with them in 2014, but Iran has many times accused Pakistan of helping these militants
 aise halaat main kathith bhartiya jasoos kii giraftaar, giraftaar ke elaan kaa vakt, pakistan or iraan kii taraf se aae bayaan, ek alag tasviir kii taraf ishaara karte hai
 Let's take a look at these situations and statements
 mana yah ja rahaa he ki kathith bhartiya jasoos kulbhushan jadhav pakistani agenciyon ke kabze main, uski giraftaar ke elaan ke kuch maheene pehle se tha
 In such a situation, the Pakistani army announced its arrest just when Pakistan's Joint Investigation Team (joint Investigation Team) arrived in India to investigate the Pathankot attack, but also Iran's President Hassan Ruhani was in Islamabad
 jab pakistani media ne is maamle main iraan kaa bhi naam lenaa shuru kiya to vahaan ke grih mantri nisaar khan ne aisa na karne kii taakid karte hue kaha ki iraan kaa bhartiya khufia tantra se koi lenaa dena nahin
 Moreover, the Iranian embassy in Islamabad issued a statement warning that if such things continue in the media, friendly relations between Pakistan and Iran can be affected
 tippaniyan According to Pakistani media, Army Chief Raheel Sharif also talked about the involvement of Indian intelligence agency RAW in Pakistan's internal affairs, especially in Balochistan, during a meeting with President Rouhani
 yahaan tak ki sena ke pravaktaa ne ro ke iraan kii zamin kaa istemaal karne ke bare main bhi chintaa jataai thi
 But at a press conference, Iran's President Ruhani flatly denied any such talks with General Raheel Sharif
 pakistan kii is puri kavayad ko iraan par ek dabaav banane kii koshish mana ja saktaa he
 Firing has taken place on the outskirts of both countries
 or pakistan sena ke aise bayaan isi taraf ishaara karte hai ki agar chabahaar main bharat-iraan kaa aisa hi sahyog chalata rahaa to pakistan apni seemaa se iraan main ghusane vaale ugravadiyon par dhilaai barat saktaa he or iraan ke ke liye mushkilen badha saktaa he
 As far as the alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav is concerned, India believes that it is a citizen but refuses to be a spy
 bharat kaa kahana he ki iraan ke chabahaar ilaake se yah shaks kaarobaar karata he or uske vahaan se agava karke pakistan pahunchaae jane kaa shaq jataayaa he
 Amidst all this, there are reports that what Jadhav was doing in Chabahar, his business was not being misused and if he was aware of it, he would investigate all these things
 
 saaf he, iraan na to bharat se or na hi pakistan se sambandh bigaadna chahta he, lekin pakistan ke dabaav main bhi nahin aana chahta
 But of course he would also like to investigate Pakistan's charge that Chabahar is not using RAW
 philhal bharat kulbhushan jadhav tak counslar acces, yani islamabad main bhartiya hai kamishan main maujuud rajanyikon ke usase milane kii ijazat, kaa intazaar kar rahaa he
 It is believed that the alleged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav was in the possession of Pakistani agencies, months before his arrest was announced

 Due to this, the work of implementing the provisions of the budget has now started from the new financial year i
e
 1st April
 pehle yah kaam june-july tak hi shuru ho paata tha
 This was also the first time that the government combined the Railway Budget and the General Budget together
 bina sanshodhan paas hua jiesti bilapure bajet satr ke dauraan sarkaar loksabhaa main 24 bill or rajyasabha main 14 bill paas kara pai

 sarkaar ke liye sabase badi uplabdhi yah rahi ki 10 saal se zyada se lataka hua jiesti bill aakhirkaar loksabhaa va rajyasabha donon se paas ho gaya
 The opposition got support despite the government not having a majority in the Rajya Sabha and the bill was also passed by the Rajya Sabha without any amendment

 But the opposition did not impede on the matters of national interest

 Apart from passing the GST and budget on time, passing the Enemy Property Bill in Rajya Sabha was also a major achievement of the government

 This could not be passed from Rajya Sabha, but the realization of not having majority in Rajya Sabha this time has also been made by the opposition

 unhone kaha ki yah bill mahilaon ke khilaaf he
 When the husband is imprisoned for three years, the woman should wait for three years
 or jab teen saal ke baad wo waapas aae to kya kahe ki bahaaron phool barasaao meraa mehboob aayaa he
 Owaisi said that you brought a provision that if someone gives a triple divorce, then he has to pay 5 times the amount of Meher

 The Supreme Court's decision against triple talaq was first welcomed by the Congress
 unhone kaha ki congress kaa virodh sirf teen talaak ko ise faujadaari maamla banane se he, jabaki yah divaani maamla he
 Gogoi demanded that the bill be sent to the standing committee
 unhone kaha ki lakhon hindu mahilaon ko unke patiyon ne chhod diya he, unki chintaa kyon nahin kii ja rahi he? Wow! Can't believe it's been 24 YEARS of # Baazigar and my career

 We often miss our morning breakfast because of the chaotic lifestyle and running
 shuru main to ye ek-do din hi hota he lekin baad main ye roj kii aadat ban jaati he
 We think that if we do not eat for a while, it does not matter that in the afternoon we will eat the entire meal, but hardly you know how bad skipping breakfast affects health
 1
 Acidity problem: Exit from home without eating anything can cause acidity because nothing has gone in your stomach all night and in the morning you have come out of the house without eating anything
 agar aap ghar se nikalate vakt thodaa kuch bhi kha lete hai to acidity kii samasya nahin hogi
 2
 upaapachay kii kriya par asar:jab aap subah sokar uthte hai to aapkaa blad pressure kam hota he
 Sugar level as well
 subah kaa naashtaa ise dobaaraa se santulit karne kaa kaam karata he
 a complete breakfast full of nutrients keeps you healthy and also determines your metabolism
 3
 For energy: We all have little energy in our body in the morning and this is the main reason for our laziness in the morning
 par agar aap subah kaa brakefast chhod dete hai toaapaki urja kaa str or girtaa hi jaataa he
 Due to which you may feel weakness
 4
 Trouble concentrating: Energy cannot be replenished by skipping Kanashta in the morning
 jis vajah se offis pahunchakar bhi aap puure dhyaan se apana kaam shuru nahin kar pate hai
 5
 swasthya par gambhir prabhaav:aisa dekha gaya he ki jo loganiyamit rup se naashtaa karte hai wo naashtaa nahin karanevaalon kii tulana main zyada swasth hote hai
 This happens only because their body gets energy from time due to which other bodily functions continue to run smoothly
 6
 Weight gain: If you take nutritious breakfast in the morning, then it also keeps your weight under control
 aisa paaya gaya he ki jo log naashtaa nahin karte hai ve naashtaa karne waalon kii tulana main jaldi mote hote hai
 7
 dimagi sakriyata ke liye:dimag ko kaam karne ke liye bhi urja kii jarurat hoti he
 If you do not eat your breakfast properly then the brain does not get energy and its activity is affected
 8
 Diabetes: People who are unable to have breakfast in the morning have an increased risk of developing diabetes
 khaastaur par mahilaon main aisa hone kaa khatra sabase adhik hota he

 edu sawan ke maheene main bhakton par bhagwaan shiv kii aseem krupa bani rahati he
 The special thing is that in this month, by taking some simple measures, you can change the inauspicious effects of the sinful planets in your horoscope
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir koun se grah hote hai ashubh or unka hamaare jivan par kya prabhaav padataa he
 Nine planets and twenty-seven constellations are studied in Vedic astrology
 in sabhi grahon main kuch shubh grah hote hai to kuch krur or kuch paap grah
 Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are considered in the sin planets
 ye jivan ko paap karm yaa paap bhaavana kii taraf prerit karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 The impact of these planets is so strong that without coming under their bad influence, a person goes towards sinful deeds even without will
 shani kaa paap prabhaav kya hota he or sawan main kaise paaen shubh parinaam-- shani kaa dushprabhav hone se vyakti aalsee, laaparvaah or kathor hota he
 - The person worships vengeful deities
 - bina saafe safai ke nimna kaaryon kii taraf jaataa he
 - When Saturn gives auspicious results, the person is disciplined
 - dhyaan or dharm ke madhyam se ishwar kii taraf chalata he
 Find Shani's auspiciousness in the month of Shravan- To increase the auspicious effect of Shani, on Saturday, plant two small plants of Peepal at some place and worship Hanuman ji
 rahu kaa paap prabhaav kya he sawan main kaise degaa shubh parinaam-- ashubh rahu charitra patan or nashe kii taraf le jaataa he
 - Rahu gives a person a conspiracy and a habit of harassing others
 - rahu ke kaaran vyakti dharm or aadhyatm kii aalochana karata he
 - If Rahu has an auspicious effect, then the person is proved from birth
 - aisi dasha main vyakti aadhyatm kaa nayaa maarg khoj letaa he
 Find the auspiciousness of Rahu in the month of Shravan- To increase the auspicious effect of Rahu, take a satvik diet
 - shiv ji kii upasna karen
 - Serve patients and the disabled
 - yoga or dhyaan kaa abhyaas avashya hi karen
 What is the sin effect of Ketu and how it will give auspicious results in the spring - due to the inauspicious effect of Ketu, a person becomes opposed to religion and God
 - jivan kii har samasya ke liye bhagwaan ko jimmedaar tehraata he
 - Sometimes the inverse becomes mentally imbalanced by using tantric directly
 - ketu agar punya kii or le jaay to tirthayatraaen karwaata he
 - Gives Sadguru to a person, makes him a saint
 ketu ko shubh cas karen-- niyamit rup se snaan karen
 - Visit pilgrimage places and auspicious places
 - ganesh ji kii upasna karen

 Varkha Chulani: He was unable to get sexual arousal
 use partner aakarshak nahin lagati thi
 But he loved her and did not want to end the relationship
 isliye usne rasta nikaala- pehle khud ko uttejit karnaa or phir bistar par aana
 In this way, he did not have to face his shortcomings
 vah hameshaa alag chijen chaahati thi
 She found that she was sinking into a life without sexual pleasure
 vah dividi chaalu karti or jo bhi usne vahaan dekha tha, use jitna sambhav hua aajamaaya
 After all, finding something new was easier to copy
 in sabko nahin pataa tha ki apni sex life main romaanch kaise bharaa jaae
 Not much mind on what to do for it, how to proceed, he used porn to 'educate' himself and understood how it could be helpful in increasing his sexual pleasure
 ye sabhi log apane phaayde ke liye porn kaa istemaal kar rahe the
 It is true, porn plays a good role when someone uses it to reduce their performance anxiety, as was the case with the first example
 yaa jab koi in filmon main dekhi vidhiyon kaa upyog aatm anand ke liye karata he, jaisaa ki mahila ne kiya tha
 Or when couples use it to get information related to sex life
 lekin yah kab hanikaarak ho jaataa he, kab yah swasth rishton ke raste main aane lagata he? shabdkosh kisi cheez ke hanikaarak ho jane ke str tak lagaataar upyog ko 'lat' (ediction) ke rup main paribhaashit karata he
 As clinical psychologists and psychiatrists specializing in the field of cognitive behavioral therapy, we define addiction or addiction as a habit when it becomes such an 'exclusive' part of life without which one cannot function
 porn 'edict' ek aisa vyakti he jo saathi ke saath yaa akele yon kriyaayein tabhi kar saktaa he jab saath-saath porn bhi chale
 For that person, watching porn becomes a kind of 'erotic thing' (fetish), such a 'need' without which he cannot have sex
 beshak, 'lat' ke shikaar log apane swayan ke vyaktitv sahit kai karkon par nirbhar hai
 However, one cannot say that the preference for porn or anything else can be called addiction
 vyasan kaa kriyaatmak shabd he us vastu kii maujuudagi ke bina kaary karne main shithilataa yaa aakshamata
 He found it difficult to consider a woman as a partner
 ek mahila ko kaisaa dikhnaa chahie or use kitna 'kamottejit' hona chahie, ye saare vichaar uske dimag main yuva hone ke varshon tak dekhe porn video se yaa mahilaon kii patrikaon se upje the jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki kisi mahilaon ko 'sexi' mana janaa chahie
 Thus, no woman was 'good' for him and he ran from one to the other
 vah apane partneron se hameshaa asantusht rahati thi
 For him, his partners were not 'tall' enough
 vah bhi usee kaalpanik fantasy main funs gai thi jo lambey samay tak porn dekhne ke kaaran uske dimag main ghar kar gai thi or vah kisi bhi purush kii mardaangi se jude kuch atiranjit khyaalon main fansi hui thi
 This repetition of imagination and beliefs can lead to this situation
 vishesh rup se un anicchhuk logon se jo un chizon par sawaal nahin karte jo ve dekhte hai yaa sunate hai
 Although the saying of 'hand bracelet ko rc kya' is somewhat correct here, but a spam porn watcher does not question the things exaggerated
 ve yah maanakar khud ko kosne lagate hai ki unhen yah nahin mil rahaa he jo vah dekh rahe hai! or yahi tulanaayen unke sex jivan kaa santulan bigaad detii hai
 Often, they incur losses in their need to imitate and / or become so angry with their partners for not meeting those 'standders' that their lives are often endangered
 kyonki unhone apane yon milan ko yaa to sab yaa phir kuch bhi nahin ke khaanche main simit kar liya he!ek mahila yaa purush ko kitna shandaar hona chahie, ek bakawaas vichaar he ki acha sex vah he jo aseemit samay tak chalata he or kai charmottejnaa (orgasm) hi 'rasta' he, sambhog mrigatrushna he or sukh ko badhaane ke liye sex main vibhinn pojishan aajmaana jaruri he or aisi kai bhrantiyaan hai jo logon ke dimag main haaavee rahati hai
 And watching porn in this situation can begin to be harmful
 isliye, yah sidhe taur par porn hi nahin he jo hamaari dharanaon ko prabhavit karata he balki vah cheez he jise dekhte hue ham ve dharanaen banaate hai
 In the first part of the article, people used porn to their advantage and helped themselves through it
 duusare main, logon ne kuch avastavik dharanaen bana lee thim or unhen iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padaa
 We are on the earth of Kamasutra, but purist views are still very dominating
 koi naitik aadesh paarit karne ke bajaae, aaie ham pornography ko us nazariye se samajhen ki yah ek dodhari talwaar sabit ho sakati he
 People embroiled in porn addiction tend to lose their morale as seen by Varkha Chulani is a Clinical Psychologist / Psychotherapist at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, and Associate Fellow and Supervisor at the Albert Ellis Institute in New York

 There has been a clash between the public and the police in Patna's Rajiv Nagar area

 The police fired 20 rounds to disperse the people
 darasal, sthaneey prashasan us kshetra main avaidh nirmaan or atikaraman hataane ke liye gaye the, tabhi unhen sthaneey logon ke krodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa

 mayawati ne kaha ki log na sirf bahan kii tarah unka sammaan karte hai balki unhen devi bhi maanate hai
 The BJP leader has done a shameful job by making such a statement
 unhone kaha, maine kabhilogon se sadak par aane ke liye nahin kaha, lekin yah unka sammaan or gussa hi he jo aaj lakhanu or desh ke duusare hisson main dekhne ko mila he

 But they did not do so
 'bijepi netaa jeet sakate the dilmayawati ne kaha, agar bijepi ke netaa dayashankar singh ke khilaaf khud exiaar darj karaate to ve meraa dil jeet sakate the
 It is normal to be fired from the party

 In Lucknow, a large number of BSP workers came up against the BJP leader carrying banner-posters
 haalanki maamla tul pakadte hi bijepi ne dayashankar ko party se 6 saal ke liye nishkasit kar diya he
 The statement was given about the sale of tickets
 It is worth mentioning that Dayashankar Singh, while commenting on the ticket sale case on Tuesday, said that the way Mayawati is negotiating, even a prostitute does not take up her profession
 unhone ne mau main yah vivaadit bayaan diya

 bharat or checkoslovakia ke bich philhal prati varsh ek arab dollars kaa vyapaar hota he

 anti-modi satraps are coming together for the Third Front with the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 upi main sapa or basapa 23 saal puraani dushmani ko bhulaakar ek hue hai
 On the other hand, Telangana CM KCR renewed the discussion on the third fronts, then West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was determined to lead it and land it
 congress is baat se khush ho rahi he ki 2019 main modi ke khilaaf vipaksh ekajute ho rahaa he
 But the solidarity of the satraps can cause trouble for the Congress more than the BJP
 aise main congress ke liye khushkhabari nahin balki tension he tisare morche kii kavayad
 Because the Congress is also engaged in this exercise
 upie chairman or congress kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne vipakshi dalon ko pichley dinon dinar par bulaayaa tha
 Mamata Banerjee and SP-BSP have started creating difficulties in the political path of 2019 for the Congress engaged in efforts for opposition mobilization at the national level
 mamata ne tisare morche kii kavayad main dilli main siyaasi dalon ke netaaon ke saath mangalavar ko mulaakaat kii
 In this list, NCP President Sharad Pawar, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, TDP leader YS Chaudhary, TRS KK
 kavita, bijedy ke pinaki mishra, argedy kii misa bharti sahit saat dalon ke netaa shaamil hai
 Not only this, Mamta also wants to make contact with rebel leaders of BJP
 mamata ne jin partiyon ke netaaon ke saath mulaakaat kii he usamen shivasena ko chhodkar baaki raajnneetik dalon ke netaa kisi na kisi rup main congress ke saathi hai
 In such a situation, if these parties become part of the third front, then there will be a setback for the Congress somewhere
 darasal congress inhinkshatrapon ko 2019 main ekajutakarke chunaav maidan main utarane kii kavayad kar rahi he
 Who will be the face of Modi when the Third Front is formed, this is a big question among the opposition, which is not easy to find answers
 congress kisi kshetreey dal ke netaa ko pradhanmantri ke chehre ke rup main sweekaar karne ke mood main nahin dikh rahi
 At the same time, the satraps of the opposition, which are potential allies of the Congress, are not ready to accept Rahul Gandhi and any other Congress leader as PM candidate
 darasal kshatrap kii apni siyaasi takat he
 There are 80 Lok Sabha seats in UP, 42 seats in West Bengal, 40 seats in Bihar and 39 seats in Tamil Nadu
 kul milakar kareeb 201 loksabhaa siten hai or congress in chaaron rajyon main junior partner (sapa, basapa, tiemasi, vamadal, argedy or diemke) ke taur par he
 In such a situation, the Congress will have to depend on the will of the regional parties
 congress kii maangi muraad in rajyon main puri hone vaali nahin he balki kshetreey dalon ke rahamokaram par hi nirbhar rahanaa padegaa
 Apart from this, the third Morchi exercise is being done with non-congress and non-bjp parties
 isse to 2019 main congress kii siyaasi nuksaan uthaanaa pad saktaa he
 On the day Rahul Gandhi was crowned as the Congress President, the leaders of his allies were calling him PM in 2019, but after three months, he is now avoiding calling Rahul as the PM candidate for 2019
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki 2019 main rahul congress kaa cheharaa to ho sakate hai lekin vipaksh kaa honge, ye kahana mushkil he
 Say Slater House, Slaughterhouse, Slaughterhouse or Kamela
 yani wo jagah jahaan jaanwaron ko kaatane kaa baqayada license diya jaataa he
 But this license is only for Buffalo
 or yahi slater house aajkal upi main sabase bada mudda bana hua he
 a question related to this issue, which everyone wants to know the answer is, will all the slaughter houses of UP be closed now or will the surf lock up on the slaughterhouses which are running illegally? So let us tell you the truth of the abattoirs of UP today
 boojadkhaanon ko lekar siyasatbaat sirf musalmaan naam se pukaare jane vaali upi kii lagbhag chaar karod janata kii nahin he
 The issue is not just about closing the slaughter house or slaughterhouse, but the question is also about the politics of slaughterhouse
 isi siyasat se uthta sabase bada sawaal ye he ki kya ab upi ke saare slater house band ho jaaenge? jaanwaron ke saare katlakhaanon par taale lag jaaenge? yaa phir sirf unheen boojadkhaanon par gaaz giregi jahaan gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se dhandha ho rahaa he, yani jinke paas jaanwaron ke katl kaa license nahin he?naa is sawaal ko chota samajhie or naa hi ise sirf or sirf raajnneeti samajhane kii bhul kiijie
 Because the matter is about 17 thousand crores and is related to employment of about three lakh people
 lihaaja sidhasat se pare sach saamne rakhana jaruri he
 The truth which some leaders of BJP themselves have embroiled in their speech
 sach ye ki kya upi ke slater house kaa asal sach he kya or slater house ko lekar die ja rahe bayanon kii asaliyat kya he?keval avaidh boojadkhaanon par honi thi karrwimgar haa, in sabase pehle ye jaan lijie ki slater house main kaate jane vaale jaanwaron kaa sach kya he? to aapako bataa duun ki upi main kul 285 slater house hai, jinke paas baqayada jaanwaron ko kaatane kaa license he or in sabhi slater house main buphelo yani bhens kaate jate hai, jiske meet ko bif kaha jaataa he
 Since beef is banned in UP
 lihaaja kisi bhi boojadkhaane ko gaay ko maarane kaa license nahin mila he
 This means that the law is to be dropped on the slaughterhouses which are running illegally
 kanoon kii kitaab main jisaki manaahi he
 She was there even before, it is still there
 bas pehle naukarshah dekh ke andekha kar dete the
 And now Farman got into action as soon as he got it
 yani khot kanoon main to kabhi tha hi nahin
 Khote was among those who implemented it at the district level
 ab bijepi ne chunaav main boojadkhaanon ko band karne kaa vaada to kar diya he
 But what about those slaughterhouses, which are licensed by the Central Government, except illegal slaughterhouses, and those which have done more than 26 thousand crores of total income of the country by doing meat business in mechanical factories
 or aane vaale vaqt main 40 hazaar karod rupee karne ja rahe hai
 Bharatbhadi is the world's No
 1 beef exporter
 
 Neither the statutory process that UP Deputy Chief Minister Kaishwa Prasad Maurya is talking about, nor the Pink Revolution is mentioned in the bjp's resolution letter, which was mentioned by PM Modi
 aaiye ek nazar un aankadon par bhi daal len jo ye bataa rahe hai ki is kaarobaar se aakhir desh ko kitni aamadani hoti he
 India is the world's number 1 beef exporter
 desh main sabase zyaada bif export upi se hota he
 In 2015, 7,515 lakh kg of meat was produced from UP
 2015 main beef export se desh kii kul kamai kareeb 27 hazaar karod thi
 In which UP alone earned a total of 17 thousand crores
 teen jilon main sabase zyada avaidh sloter husebaphalo yani bhens ke meet kii maang duniya bhar main sabase zyada he or bharat iskaa sabase bada niryaatak desh he
 According to statistics, only 20 percent of buffalo meat is exported from India
 uttar pradesh main bharat kii 28 fisadi bhainse hai
 This means that Uttar Pradesh has the largest buffalo in India
 bharat ke 60 fisadi boojadkhaane or meet processing units akele uttar pradesh main hai
 Due to the licensee slot house, about 3 lakh people of the state have got employment
 pashchimi upi ke bijanour, amroha or chandpur main sabase zyaada avaidh sloter house hai
 Illegal slaughterhouse under the garb of license, Hindustan is the largest exporter of buffalo meat in the world, not from today but for years
 yahaan tak ki isse jude baaki product se bhi desh ke khajaane main har saal karodon rupye jamaa hote hai
 Moreover, many big pharmaceutical companies of the country also use their different products in making medicines
 magar ek doosraa sach gaye bhi he ki licency boojadkhaane kii aad main bahut se gaiyr licency boojadkhaane bhi chal rahe hai
 Which are really harmful in every way and it is necessary to rein
 upi main bhainson kii sankhya main hua ijafabas yun samajhie ki pashu utpaada yani animal products kaa indian iconmi se ye judaav to sirf ek jhalak bhar he
 
 par sawaal ye he ki yogi ke mukhyamantri banate hi upi main boojadkhaanon kii jo tasviir pesh kii ja rahi he usamen hakeekat kitni he
 The Livestock Census 2012 report states that the number of buffaloes in Uttar Pradesh has increased by 28 per cent in 2012 compared to 2007, while the number of cows in Uttar Pradesh has also increased by 10 per cent during the same period
 maharashtra main hai sabase zyada boojadkhaneenimal hasbendry department ne artiai ke zarie puche gaye ek sawaal ke jawaab main ye bhi kaha he ki desh main boojadkhaanon ke liye sabase zyaada badnaam upi asal main sabase zyaada sloter house ke maamle main pehle nahin duusare number par he
 Where there are only 285 slaughterhouses
 jabaki is fehrist main pehla number maharashtra kaa he, jahaan 316 boojadkhaane hai
 Three dozen slaughterhouses in UP have licenses, not only this, but there are about three dozen slaughterhouses in Uttar Pradesh which are licensed and registered with the central government
 jinamein sabase zyada 7 aligarh main hai
 5 in Ghaziabad district
 chaar unnav main
 Three are in Meerut and two in Saharanpur
 iske alaava barabanki, bulandshahr, mujffarnagar, gautamabuddha nagar, hapur, muradabad, rampur, bareli, jhaansi, or lakhanu main bhi ek-ek boojadkhana registerd he
 The NGT sought an illegal slotter house
 Last year, the Central Pollution Control Board had informed the National Green Tribunal that after examining 126 slaughterhouses in UP it was found that only one of them had a slaughterhouse license
 jabaki tamaam licency boojadkhaanon kii jaanch ke baad ye baat bhi saamne ai ki unamem se sirf 21 ke paas hi sahi treetment plant he
 After this, the NGT sent a notice to the Center and the UP government seeking a reply on the illegal slotter houses in Aligarh, Ghaziabad, Sambhal and Bulandshahr
 upi he sabase bada bif niryaatak rajyabharat main upi sabase bada beef niryaatak rajya he
 Beef here means buffalo meat
 bif lafz par jor isliye he kyonki ise lekar desh main bahes kisi bhi mudde se hameshaa kahin zyaada rahi
 Whereas according to government statistics, the fact is that buffalo accounts for 95% of the animal products exported from the country
 aise main ab ye charchaa ek baar phir purazor tareeke se ho rahi he kyonki bijepi ne avaidh or yantric boojadkhaanon ko band karne kaa sankalp lekar is peshey se jude lakhon logon main khalabali machaa di he
 The action started in 24 hours, within 24 hours of Yogi Adityanath taking oath as CM in UP, the Yogi government has started fulfilling the promises of BJP resolution letter
 soobe ke kai ilaakon main avaidh boojadkhaanon kii ceiling shuru ho chuki he
 Of which the slaughterhouses of Varanasi, Lakhimpur Kheri, Unnao, Ghazipur, Allahabad, Dasna, Saharanpur, Mathura, Shamli, Aligarh, Bulandshahar, Meerut, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Barabanki, and Sambhal are prominent
 kai logon ke liye jindagi or maut kaa savaivaidh or vaid kii bahes se alag jinaki or jinke khandaan kii zindagi ke guzar basar ke liye boojadkhana zaruri he
 There is a lot of discomfort in them
 unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki rato-raat agar ye hone laga to khaaengen kya or jaaenge kahaan
 The fear of the Yogi government's action is that a shopkeeper threw kerosene on himself after seeing the police who had come to close the illegal meat shop in Gajraula, Amroha
 vaade se mukar nahin sakati sarkaarchunaav prachaar ke dauraan boojadkhaane band karne kaa vaada bijepi kii pehali fehrist main shaamil tha
 But the reality is that from the government to the general public, there is a confuse for not closing slaughterhouses
 bade bade jaankaar bhi sir khuja rahe hai
 The problem is also difficult for the government that cannot promise what it promised
 or chote str ke vyapaariyon ko chhodkar bade vyapaariyon kii gardan par haath rakh nahin sakati kyonki hazaron karod kaa dhandha isi se judaa he or upi ke lakhon logon kaa rojgaar bhi
 Therefore, a new revolution will come overnight
 aisi ummid bhi bemaani he
 Senior BJP leader Ram Madhav said on Friday that leaders under house arrest in Jammu and Kashmir will be released soon and can participate in their 'normal' political activities
 jammu-kashmir ko vishesh darja dene se sambandhit anuchhed 370 ke adhiktar praavdhaanon ke nirasan par ‘jan jaagran sabha' main bhaajapa mahasachiv ne kaha ki vahaan raashtrapati shashan ke hatane or vidhanmandal ke prabhaav main aa jane ke baad anusuchit jati ayog, mahila ayog, alpsankhyak ayog jaise sanvaidhanik nikaay bhi gathit kiye jaaenge

 Ramadhav said, "it is propaganda that thousands of people have been arrested (in Jammu and Kashmir)
" main aaj aapako bataaun ki ve 200 netaa ehtiyaati taur par hiraasat main hai

 yah maanavadhikaar kaa ulanghan nahin he
 He said, "precautionary detention is a temporary measure to ensure law and order in the state, along with good facilities like TV and books and other things in Panchsitara hotels
" '' unhone kaha ki 200 logon ko jail main rakhane se kuch ghatnaon ko chhodkar mote taur par shanti kii sthiti he
 Ramadhav said, "you can imagine how effective this is
" lekin aap yah nahin samajhe ki main kah rahaa hum ki ve hameshaa ke liye jail main rahenge

 Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt says that whenever Anupam Kher achieves something, his heart is filled with pride despite different political ideologies
 mahesh bhatta ne hi apni 1984 main ai film 'saransh' ke saath hindi film udyog main abhinayta anupam kher ko launch kiya tha
 Kher (64) believes in right-wing political ideology and is a great supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi)
 jabaki mahesh bhatta ek udaar or dharmanirpeksh raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke liye jane jate hai
 The theme of his ideological inequality came up during the launch of Anupam Kher's book, Lessons Life That Me Unnally, where Mahesh Bhatt arrived as a guest
 is dauraan bhatta se sawaal kiya gaya ki raajnneeti main vipareet vichaardhaaraon ke baavjood aisa kya he, jo unhen ek saath rakhata he
 Speaking to the media during the event, Mahesh Bhatt said, “I am happy that this question came up
 hamaari puri tarah se alag raajnneetik vichaardhaaraon ke baavjood aap hamaare bare main jo chaahe soch-vichaar karte rahen
 i remember before the 2014 general elections, Karan Thapar (journalist) tried to pit us against each other in a television interview
 us vakt vah (anupam kher) mujhase asahmat the, lekin anupam kher (anupam Kher) kaa matlab yahi he
 "mahesh Bhatt said," Why can't we live under the same roof, where we can disagree with each other? And why can't we retain the human love and affection that is necessary for the survival of mankind
 " anupam kher (anupam Kher) ko bollywood main maukey dene vaale bhatta ne kaha ki jab kher kuch hasil karte hai to unka dil garv se bhar jaataa he

 BJP has suffered the maximum loss in seat sharing in the NDA, therefore, the most internal battle is also being seen in BJP itself
 bijepi kii 4 siten jediu ko or ek seat algepi ko gai he jabaki party ke rashtriya pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain kii seat bhagalpur bhi jediu main khate main chali gai he
 JDU general secretary RCP Singh went to Delhi on Monday
 seat bantwaare ke baad aaaraseepi singh ke dilli jane ko isi se jod kar dekha ja rahaa he
 The biggest ruckus in the BJP is due to the move of Nawada LJD to Union Minister Giriraj Singh's seat and JDU to Shahnawaz Hussain's seat
 kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad kii seat patna sahib tay hone kii khabar ko lekar unke or rajyasabha saansad aarake sinha ke bich tanatani jari he
 The move to JDU, the seat of Bhagalpur and Balmikinagar, has seen resentment among local BJP workers and several Mandal presidents have also offered mass resignations
 giriraaj singh nawad seat na mili se naaraaz hai
 He said that Nawad did not even ask him before giving the seat to the LJP
 haalanki mana ja rahaa he ki giriraaj singh ko begusarai se tikat diya jayega jahaan se wo 2014 main chunaav ladna chaahate the
 But in response Giriraj Singh says that i am a worker, was a worker and will be a worker
 iskaa matlab ye he ki party jahaan se kahegi vahaan se chunaav ladenge
 But Giriraj Singh's reply did not tolerate bjp's MLC Rajneesh Kumar from Begusarai as the ticket contender and he tweeted that Giriraj Singh should now end his fascination and stop the drama and prepare to come to Begusarai to fight
 
 rajnish kumaar kaa kahana he ki pichley kai dinon se ye baat ho rahi he ki navada seat algepi ko chali gai he tab giriraaj singh ne kyon nahin bolaa tab wo chup the
 Now that the seat-sharing has been announced, they are expressing their displeasure after that
 wo ye bhi nahin kah rahe hai ki begusarai se chunaav nahin ladenge
 Rajnish Kumar says that in Begusarai, he is also speaking to his people to prepare for the election
 patna sahib se bijepi kendriya mantri ravishankar prasad ko utaarne kii taiyaari main hai lekin yaheen se rajyasabha saansad aar ke sinha bhi daavedaari kar rahe hai
 Both come from Kayastha caste and Patna Sahib is a Kayastha dominated Lok Sabha constituency
 bijepi aalaa kaman kii pehali pasand ravishankar prasad he to aresas aar ke sinha ko ummidavaar banane main laga he
 On Monday, Kayastha Mahasabha also said that only RK Sinha has his support
 ab tak sabase teji se vikaas kar rahe endie shasit soobe bihar ko peeche chhodte hue bijepi shasit madhya pradesh desh main pehle paaydaan par pahunch gaya he
 Madhya Pradesh has been ranked number one in terms of economic development in the Central Statistical Organization's 2012-13 preliminary report
 is uplabdhi se gadgad madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kehete hai ki unka sankalp puraa hota dikh rahaa he or ve iskaa shrey khud ke netritv or team bhaavana ko dete hue desh ke vikaas main prabhavi bhoomika nibhaane vaala madhya pradesh banane ke sapane kaa izhaar karte hai
 Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath's stronghold reached Chhindwara to unveil the development plans, as he was in many rounds to meet Chauhan and talked to India Today chief correspondent Santosh Kumar
 pesh he unase hui vishesh baatcheet ke anshakendriya sankhyikeey sanghathan kii taaja report main rajya kii aarthik tarakkee ko desh main number van bataaya gaya he
 What will you say on this achievement of the state? It is a matter of pleasure for me that our resolve seems to be fulfilled
 madhya pradesh kii jidipi ho yaa krishi vikaas dar ho kul milakar sakal gharelu utpaada ke maamle main pichley saal bhi ham dabl disit main the or is baar bhi dabl disit main hai
 Now we have come out of the category of sick state
 pichley paanch-chah saal main ham logon ne jo lagaataar prayaas kiya infrastracchar badhaayaa, sadakon kaa jaal bichaaya, 24 ghante bijli ab may ke aakhir tak har gaanv main milane lagenge or uske saath-saath krishi, industry or maanav sansaadhan vikaas par jo hamane dhyaan diya isse madhya pradesh kii arthvyavastha wibrant (gatiman) ho gai he
 Farming is a profitable business, so the purchasing power of farmers has also increased, the state has also benefited from this
 is uplabdhi par ham logon ko garv he, lekin or aage badhane kii sambhaavna he
 What do you believe is the main factor behind the growth rate and keeping it intact? Planned development plans
 madhya pradesh main aseem sambhaavnaaen thi, us sambhaavnaaon kaa dohan nahin hua tha
 We have arranged three times more irrigation to take agriculture forward
 pehle soobe main 7 lakh hectare main sinchai hoti thi, ab badhkar 24 lakh hectare ho gaya he
 Loan given to the farmer at zero interest rate, on wheat we get 1500 rupees
 prati quintal ke hisaab se bonus dene kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 We have given so much convenience to the farmers, we have also changed the crop pattern and the state has also benefited from it
 fal, phool, subjiyon kii kheti shuru kii he
 Secondly, the industry that never used to come here, but we have attracted industrialists by continuously holding Global Investor
 aaj madhya pradesh main udyog lagane kii drushti se dekhe to hamaara rajya desh ke pratham panktiyon ke rajya main khadaa ho gaya he
 Not one industry is coming in every sector
 hamane maanav kaushal vikaas par bhi jor diya, uskaa apana yogadan he, bijli kii aapurti ke liye sadakon kaa jaal bichaaya uskaa bhi apana ek yogadan he
 The income of the poor man increased and how the light of development reached the poor was also taken care of
 garib tak sirf baantne nahin, balki uski aay badhaane main bhi kai tarah kaa kaam kiya
 For example, making hand carts the owner of hand carts, rickshaws with rickshaws, providing artisans with margin money on loans, subsidy on interest
 hamane jo mukhya prayaas kiye hai, ve hai power, sinchai, kheti laabh kaa dhandha, industry, scold main power taiyaar karnaa or garib kii aarthik sthiti sudhaarna
 Purchasing power increased due to increase in income, which made the whole economy in motion, the benefit of that is now visible
 is aarthik vikaas dar main netritv kaa aap kitna mahatv dekhte hai?rajya bimaaru rajya kii shrenee main tha ye puraa desh jaanata he
 There was a stubbornness, passion, passion in mind, there was a resolve to take the state forward
 kul milakar isamen netritv kaa role rahata hi he, lekin hamalogon ne team bhaavana se kaam kiya
 He created a team spirit in the state and launched the campaign 'aao Bane Madhya Pradesh', so that the common citizen should have a feeling that we should also contribute in building the state
 isse janata kaa mindset bhi badla or hamaari team bhi lagi
 You know that it definitely has a leadership role
 madhya pradesh ke vikaas kaa asar 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main kis tarah dikhegaa?abhi to 2013 main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai or mujhe lagata he ki hamen janata kaa bharpoor aashirwad milegaa
 Also in 2014, Madhya Pradesh will win the maximum number of Lok Sabha seats in the country
 pichhali baar 29 main se 16 siten bijepi ne pradesh main jiti thi, is baar kitna hoga?dekhie, number main kahana sahi nahin hoga, lekin nishchit taur par pichley aankade se ham aage badhenge or ham pradesh se sarvaadhik loksabhaa siten jitakar party or desh ko denge
 Along with development, a large number of corruption cases are also coming out from Madhya Pradesh
 kya vikaas ke saath bhrashtachar badha he yaa kuch or vajah he?hamaare yahaan lokayukta kanoon itnaa shashakt he ki prathamdrishtya agar aay se adhik sampatti he to chaape maarthe hai, aarthik aparaadh shakha chapa martha he, lokayukta chaape maarthe hai
 There is always a desire from my side that if there is something wrong, then check it, raid it, seize property and get it ruled
 hamane sampatti rajasat karne kaa kanoon bana rakhaa he
 Which is the state where so many raids have been done? Many times more corruption will be found elsewhere from Madhya Pradesh but if you do not raid or take action, it will not be visible
 duusare rajya bhi karrwai karen to madhya pradesh se zyada bhrashtachar nikalegaa
 If we catch a mistake, it is our duty
 aap bataaie dilli main karpshan nahin he kya? ham karrwai kar rahe hai karpshan ke khilaaf
 We enacted the Public Service Delivery Act, which is being followed by many states of the country
 hamane special court banaae bhrashton kii sampatti rajasat karne ke liye
 If we are working against corruption then it is visible, it does not mean that we have more
 paardarshita kii baat he, agar aap karrwai nahin karoge to nahin dikhegaa
 The state has caught the path of development, in such a situation, how will Madhya Pradesh be the imagination of Shivraj Singh Chauhan? May the glory of the people, Ram Raj
 roti, kapadaa, makaan, dawaai kaa intjaam
 State should be better in terms of education and health
 koi bina ilaj ke na rahe, bina shiksha ke na rahe
 Everyone should get high quality education
 sabko rojgaar mili, har khet ko pani mili, har haath ko kaam ho ye meraa sapana he
 But not only that, we will not just grow
 vikaas ke saath-saath sanskaar dene kaa bhi kaam karenge, kyonki kai samasyaon kaa samaadhaan ek sanskaarit samaaj se hi ho saktaa he
 Character building, honesty, patriotism, hard work can develop such human qualities
 pradesh ke liye bhi kaam karen or ek acchhee duniya banane main ham apana behatar yogadan de saken
 i believe that the seven and a half million people of Madhya Pradesh have been enriched and developed and if they move in the right direction, then the people of the state will also contribute significantly in the prosperity and development of their country, we will try to make Madhya Pradesh the same

 Congress calls for tradition

 Rahul will not project as PM candidate but the election will be fought under his leadership
 yani party ne ye gunjaaish bachaa lee ki agar party chunaav main kamyaabi kaa jhanda laharaati he to rahul ko rajkumaar se samraat banane ke bharpoor maukey haath main rahen
 The BJP has clearly pointed out to the Congress that this has not been the tradition of the Congress, but after the results of the assembly elections in four states, Sonia Gandhi indicated that it should break the tradition
 tab sonia gandhi ne kaha tha ki sahi samay par pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar kaa elaan kiya jayega
 Now that the right time has not come for Sonia Gandhi but the BJP has got the perfect opportunity to target its rival party
 bijepi ne congress par waar karte hue kaha ki party ne haar ke dar se nahin banaaya kisi ko piem pad kaa ummidavaar
 The BJP will say anything but the entire decision of the Congress is well thought out
 modi jaise anbhavi netaa ke khilaaf rahul ko sidhi takkar se bachaa bhi liya or kamyaabi kii sthiti main rahul ke sir par sehara sajaane kaa rasta bhi khulaa rakhaa
 BJP general secretary Ram Madhav on Saturday targeted the opposition in Jammu in a film-like manner and said that we have Modi
 unhone kaha ki vipakshi kheme main kisi ke paas pradhanmantri modi jaisi kshamta nahin he
 The BJP leader said this line on the lines of the film wall's dialogue "mere Paas Maa Hai"
 haalanki, unhone galati kar ise shashi kapur kii bajaay amitabh bachchan kaa dialog bataa diya jabaki film main yah dialog shashi kapur ne bolaa tha
 Addressing an election rally in Reasi district, he emphasized that Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the country "corruption and terrorism free" and entered Pakistan to create terror among terrorists
 madhav ne kaha ki vipaksh ke paas koi netaa nahin he, lekin hamaare paas modi he
 That is why they are (alliance)
 mahagathbandhan banane kii unki koshish vifal rahi kyonki vipaksh ke kai log pradhanmantri kii kursi par najar gadaaye hue hai
 Appealing to Union Minister Jitendra Singh to win the re-election from Udhampur Lok Sabha seat, Madhav asked why he (opposition) wants to remove Modi from power? Because Modi made the country corruption and terrorism free and he wants every citizen to stand on his feet and be a part of progressive country

 с наступающими вас! ✨😍 # 🎄 # рождество # weihnachten # christmas # christmastree # gifts # xmas # xmasgiftsa post shared byviktoria (@ mrswikie5) ondec 24, 2018 at 1:43 am PST Where and how has Christianity started in India? That Christianity started first in India was from the coastal city of Kranganore in Kerala
 mana jaataa he ki isa messiah ke 12 pramukh shishyon main se ek saint thomas 52 A
 d came to Kodungallur in Kerala
 bharat aane ke baad saint thomas ne 7 carch banaavaaye
 Also persuaded people of other religions to accept Christianity
 iske baad saint thomas logon kaa dharm-parivartan karte hue bharat ke poorvitatpar chale gaye or vahaan se china ko paar kar gaye the
 On his return to India, he settled in Madras i
e
 Chennai and started giving information about Christianity to the people here
 lekin chennai ke logon ne nae dharm ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 It is also said that after this, the people here started persecuting the Saint Thomas and were slaughtered in a cave
 chennai main ye jagah saint thomas mount ke naam se aaj bhi prasiddh he
 In 1523, the Portuguese built a church on his grave, where a large number of people go
 mana jaataa he ki saint thomas jis vakt bharat aae the, us samay kai european deshon main isai dharm nahin tha
 Hence the roots of Christianity in India had already spread to many European countries
 bihari babu or bijepi ke saansad shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki indira gandhi jaisaa dabang, sabase majboot, sabase dayaaloo or star pradhanmantri ab tak desh main nahin hua
 He said that no one has got as much stardom as Indira Gandhi got in the country and abroad
 halaki saath hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ko bhi unhon dabang dianemic pradhanmantri kaa khitaab diya
 The guide gun told Indira Gandhi that she has also discussed it in her book, Anything Butt Silence
 shatrughna sinha ne kaha ki agar wo jivit hoti or main raajnneeti main jaataa to shaayad main congress main hota
 Because Indira Gandhi believed me a lot
 mujhe unka pyaar or sneh bahut mila tha
 He always met at very short notice
 wo meri maardarshak thim
 Shatrughna Sinhan left no stone unturned in praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Dynamic Patna
 unhone modi ko bhi dynemic kaha or saath main yah bhi kaha ki narendra modi ne bahut kuch sabit kiya he lekin abhi bahut kuch karnaa baaki he
 Shatrughan Sinha does not want to compare Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi
 unka maananaa he ki wo congress kaa daur tha
 His policies were an advance in his destiny
 unhone kaha log atal bihari vaajapeyi or narendra modi kii tulana karnaa chaahate hai lekin yah sambhav hi nahin he
 No one has become like Atal ji, he is a father figure, everyone has learned from him
 ham ho yaa phir narendra modi hon
 Atal ji is a teacher figure
 unki tulana kisi ne nahin kii ja sakati he
 Kishtrughan Sinha, praising PM Modi, while discussing the rites in politics, said that we had heard that Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given the title of Durga to Indira Gandhi during the Battle of Bangladesh
 raajnneeti main yahi hona chahie jo acha kaam kare unki prashansa honi chahie
 Shatrughan Sinha said that people tell me why do you meet the leaders of the opposition party
 lekin atal ji ne durga kaa khitaab indira gandhi ko diya
 Indira and Vajpayee were symbols of the public mind
 usee tarah aaj ke daur main modi bhi hai
 Shatrughan Sinha praised Narendra Modi and said that there is maturity in his politics
 unki timming bilkul sahi he
 He gave a message to the world that our tolerance and sense of peace should not be considered weakness
 shatrughna sinha ne ye bhi kaha ki hamaare pradhanmantri desh kii ichha or apeksha ke pratik hai
 They have lived up to the expectations of the country
 shatrughna sinha ne desh kii sena ko bhi salaam kiya or sargical strike par pradhanmantri kii jamkar tarif bhi kii
 Shatrughan Sinha, while comparing the side effect of a film Pyaar on the politics of taking a surgical strike, said that this is an effect of that
 unhone kaha ki ham nahin chaahate hai ki yuddh kii sthiti bane
 We want peace vikaas kii raah par chalanaa chaahate hai
 He said that war is always the last option
 ye sargical strik he jo gaddaar hamaare desh ko thes pahunchaa rahe the, apane aatanki gatividhiyon kaa nanga naach kar rahen the unhen sabak sikhaanaa jaruri tha
 Our overbearing Prime Minister gave him a befitting reply

 Global experts in the crude oil sector claim that crude oil may soon cross $ 100 a barrel
 aise main kya is baat ke liye taiyaar rahane kii jarurat he ki bahut jald desh main petrol kii keemat 100 rupee prati litre ke str par pahunch jaaegi
 The journey from 2012 to 2017 for crude oil in the global market has proved to be a game changer for the country's politics
 jahaan pichhali congress sarkaar kii chunautiyon ko global crude oil kii keemton ne itnaa badha diya ki 2014 main mahangaai ke mudde par sarkaar ko chunaav main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 At the same time, soon after the election results in 2014, global crude oil prices proved to be a boon for the new BJP government formed at the center
 is dauraan hue utaar-chadhaav ke bich jahaan global market main crude oil kii keemat 125 dollar prati bairal se lekar 30 dollar prati bairal tak ludhaki, vahiin desh main petrol kii keemat 76 rupee se 56 rupee prati litre tak gai
 Now once again, there is an improvement in the prices of crude in the global market
 gemeanger: manmohan kii patkhni or modi kaa vardaanjanvari 2012 main manmohan singh sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan antarrashtriya bazaar main crude oil 125 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai or 2014 main hue aam chunaavon tak yah keemat lagaataar 100 dollar prati bairal par bani rahi

 This slippery does not end here
 janvari 2016 tak crude oil kii keemten girakar apane abtak ke nunatam str 30 dollar prati bairal par pahunch gai
 It is worth noting that the price of crude oil is the biggest and most important expenditure from the central government treasury

 lekin beete do maheene se global market main crude oil ke prati din utaar-chadhaav or desh main tex ke aankalan se prati din petrol kii keemat nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 So during these three years, due to heavy changes in crude prices, the price of petrol is also fluctuating
 2012 main jab crude oil kii keemat sheersh par thi, dilli main prati litre petrol 73 rupee se 67 rupee prati litre bik rahaa tha
 At the same time, when the price of crude oil started slipping in 2014, the price of petrol in Delhi was sold from Rs 73 to Rs 63 per liter during the whole year

 haalanki puure saal ke dauraan petrol kii keemat 66 rupee se 60 rupee prati litre tak rahi
 By October 2016, the game of cheap petrol was over and the prices of petrol started increasing once again
 is dauraan ek litre petrol kii keemat waapas 66 rupee se badhkar 70 rupee ke str par pahunch gai or saal 2017 ke dauraan ek baar phir petrol kii keemat 70 rupee prati litre se 63 rupee prati litre par pahunch gai

 gauratlab he ki 2008 main crude oil abtak ke sarvaadhik str 145 dollar prati bairal par thi
