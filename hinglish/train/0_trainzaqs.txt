 This year on the occasion of 'valentine's Day', which is celebrated as a symbol of love, the tone of fundamentalist right-wing organizations seems to have changed
 shivasena, bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) jaise hinduvadi sanghathanon ne is saal 'vailentins de' ke avasar par yuva premi jodon kii khushiyon main khalal na daalane kaa aashwaasan diya he
 "we have no objection to the celebrations of Valentine's Day", said Shailendra Jaiswal, Bajrang Dal province convenor (delhi)
 iske khilaaf koi dharna-pradarshan nahin kiya jayega, lekin yuvaaon ko apni shaleenta kaa parichay dena chahie
 He said that the Bajrang Dal has always been a priest of love and love
 kisi ek din kii bajaae saal ke prayek din pyaar karnaa bharat kii gauravshaalee parampara rahi he
 Jaiswal said, yet if the youth chooses a particular day to express love, then we have no objection
 pyaar main nagnata, vaasana, abhadrata or ashleelata kaa koi sthaan nahin he
 Love is the real form of love, living within cultural limits
 jaiswal ne rajdhani ke yuvaaon se apil kii he ki 'vailentins de' kii aad main paashchaatya samskruti kaa andhanukaran kar sadakon, udyanon, hotalon, pabon va form houseon main ashleel or abhadrata istemaal kar apsamskruti ko badhaava na den
 He said that the Bajrang Dal wants to ensure that conditions do not arise in the capital on this day that mothers and sisters feel insecure and refrain from going out
 'vailentins de' se bajrang dal kaa koi virodh nahin he
 "we have written to the Delhi Police Commissioner, hotels, pubs, restaurants, etc
, requesting that they use drug and pornography anywhere in the capital on the occasion of Valentines Day," said Bajrang Dal province media chief Vinod Bansal
 Do not let the performance happen
 saath hi asaamaajik tatwon ke khilaaf sakht kanoonee karrwai karen
 He said, some commercial companies and certain categories of people are trying to use such occasions for their own benefit
 gauratlab he ki kattarwadi hindu sanghathanon pashchimi samskruti ke khilaaf premi jodon or aise samarohon main khalal daalane ke liye jane jate rahe hai
 In general, members of the organization have been vandalizing restaurants, hotels, gardens and shops for greeting cards, which have been widely criticized
 bajrang dal ke kaaryakarta udai sharma ne kaha, iske pehle ham 'vailentins de' ke maukey par yojit samarohon main premi jodon ko pakadakar chetavanee dete the or unhen shaadi karne ko kehete the
 Also threatened to hand over to the police or their parents, but this year we have decided not to oppose it
 pichley saal pradesh ke bacchon ko sweater baantne main vifal rahi uttar pradesh kii yogi sarkaar kii beparwahee ek phir ujagar hui he
 The Yogi government has failed to fulfill the promise made to school children
 31 july kii miyaad guzar chuki he lekin abhi tak sabhi bacchon ko kitaaben, juute or mojey nahin mili hai
 The condition is such that children are forced to come to school wearing torn shoes, tattered bags and torn clothes
 sarkaar ne hi tay kiya tha ki 31 july tak sabko kitaaben de denge
 At the same time, the government also talked about giving shoes and socks to all children
 lekin yogi sarkaar ke shiksha vibhaag in sab baton se anbhigya he
 Neither the address of the tender, nor of purchase, of payment nor of partition
 gaur ho ki rajya main pehali se aathvin tak 1 karod 54 lakh bachche hai
 Books, shoes and bags are to be given by the government to all children
 lekin sarkaar kii andekhi or beparwahee ke kaaran 1
 5 crore children are waiting for books and shoes
 bachche bole- nahin mila kitaab or juuta-mojalakhanuke jiamu skool ke saikadon bachche bina kitabon, bina juute or bina baste ke hai
 Sonu Kumar, a student of the fifth class of this school, says that he has not yet received shoes and socks from the government, so he is forced to come to school wearing slippers
 vahiin, isi skool k chhathi class kii chaatra kaa kahana he ki use skool se kitaaben nahin mili hai
 In this regard, when he spoke to the school's principal Jyoti Tiwari, he said that all the arrangements of the government are air
 bacchon ke paas na kitaaben hai, na juute hai na baste hai
 It may be noted that the government did not fulfill the promise of giving sweaters to school children in the winter, as a result, the children had removed the entire winter without sweaters
 ab sawaal ye he ki bina kitabon ke bachche kaise padhenge
 Uttar Pradesh Primary Education Minister Anupama Jaiswal said that books and shoes were to be distributed to the children till 31 July but it is delayed due to procedural reasons
 sarkaar jald hi bacchon ko sabhi chijen uplabdh karavaaegi
 5 months without a book, the Balayogi government has fixed August 31 to save its nose
 matlab ek april se bacchon kii padhai shuru hui or 31 agast tak unhen kitaab nahin milegaa
 5 months how a child will read without a book
 saal main keval 9 maheene hi padhai hoti he or teen maheene chuttee hoti he
 In such a situation, children will have to read for 5 months without a book and will get only 4 months to read from the book
 ye us uttar pradesh kii kahani he jahaan pehali se aathvin tak ke skulon main 1,53,307 shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 Posts of 5390 assistant teachers are lying vacant
 15013 skulon main headmaster tak nahin hai
 Children do not have books, dress and bags too
 mukesh chopra se poochtacha main jab jasusi ke koi saboot nahin mili to unhen manekshaw centre kii librari se china se jude sahitya kii nau kitaaben chori karne ke aarope main do november ko giraftaar kar liya gaya, lekin saat november ko unki tihaad jail main rahasyamay halaat main maut ho gai
 The Tihar jail authorities say that he committed suicide by jumping from the roof, while the housemates are saying that Mukesh has been murdered
 ghar waalon ke mutabik captain mukesh chopra 1998 se canada main rah rahe the
 He also had American citizenship
 mukesh chopra 31 oktober ko apane parivaar ke kisi sadsy kaa berthde manaane ke liye bharat aae the
 He went to the Manekshaw Center on 1 November
 vahaan open librari se unhone kuch book nikaalin
 After this, the military police caught them
 unke parivaar kaa kahana he ki un par china ke liye jasusi karne ke aarope bebuniyaad hai
 He used to go shopping in Hong Kong
 haalanki unhen cleptomania kii beemaari thi, jiske chalate ve saamaan uthaa lete the
 He had done this several times in Canada as well
 ghar waalon kaa kahana he ki naukari ke dauraan unase ek camera gaayab ho gaya tha isliye unhen sena ne 1983 main naukari se nikaal diya tha
 But spying is not right
 vahiin jaanch agenciyon kaa kahana he ki mukesh chopra ke paas karodo rupee kii epady mili hai
 His mobile has been sent for forensic investigation
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath lambey samay se chale aa rahe ek andhvishwaas ko todane ja rahe hai
 For this, he will visit Noida on 25 December
 darasal, yah andhvishwaas he ki agar uttar pradesh kaa koi mukhyamantri apane kaarykaal ke dauraan noida kaa daura karata he, to usko kursi ganvaani padati he
 Due to this, Akhilesh Yadav avoided coming to Noida for 5 years as the Chief Minister and he did not step even once during his tenure
 ab yogi adityanath noida aa rahe hai, wo aisa karne vaale wo 29 saal main sirf duusare mukhyamantri honge
 Explain that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is going to break a superstition related to the Noida Yatra
 yogi adityanath 25 disambar ko siyaasi taur par 'apshakun' samajhe jane vaale noida jaaenge
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the metro rail service from the Botanical Gardens of Noida to Kalkaji in South Delhi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath will be present at the function
 yahi nahin yogi 23 disambar ko noida jaakar 25 disambar ke kaarykram kii taiyaariyon kii samiksha bhi lenge
 Adityanath is the second Chief Minister who is deliberately daring to go to Noida, considered politically 'ill-fated'
 isse pehle purv mukhyamantri mayawati jaanate-boojhte 2011 main noida gai thim or 2012 ke chunaavon main unhen haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 In the last 29 years, no Chief Minister, except Mayawati, could muster the courage to go to Noida
 isi chakkar main 2012 se 2017 tak mukhyamantri rahe akhilesh yadav noida nahin aae
 On visiting Noida, the visit to these CM chair Noida was so unfortunate for the Chief Minister of UP, that whoever showed a chance to come to Noida here and there, he has to lose his hands from the cm's chair
 upi kaa mukhyamantri rahete hue hue vir bahadur singh ne noida kaa daura kiya tha jiske kuch din baad june 1988 ko unki kursi chali gai
 Then in 1989, Narayan Dutt came to Tivarinoida and had to relinquish the cm's chair
 upi main bijepi kii sarkaar bani or satta ke sihansan par kalyaan singh virajman hue
 Kalyan Singh came to Noida in 1999 and had to retire from his chair
 1995 main mukhyamantri rahete hue mulaayam singh yadav ne noida kaa daura kiya par agali baar wo satta se baahar ho gaye or 1997 main mayawati ke noida aane ke baad hi satta ne unase duuri bana liya tha
 But when Mayawati came to power with Purna Bahumat in 2007, she came to Noida in 2011 and suffered a crushing defeat in the 2012 assembly elections
 upi ke paanch mukhyamantriyon kii kursiyaan jane ke baad ab yogi adityanath aa rahe hai
 Yogis, bypassing superstition and bad habits, are creating their own traditions of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness and are making their own tradition
 21veen sadi main aakar kisi shahar ke liye shakun or apshakun kii baat karnaa vastav main hairaani bharaa he

 Shiv Sena expected to get 50-70 seats in Maharashtra election; BJP emerging as a big party with 109-124 seats
 With the start of Maharashtra assembly elections, Shiv Sena tries to present its young leader and son of Uddhav Thackeray Aditya Thackeray as Chief Minister
 i was seen doing bhale hi shivasena ne khulkar kuch nahin bolaa, lekin andarkhaane ye baat chalati rahi ki agar party majboot sthiti main hoti he to vah aditya thakare ko mukhyamantri banane kaa daawa pesh karegi, lekin India today-axis My India ke agsit pole ke survey agar nateezon main tabdeel hote hai to shivasena ke siem pad ke armaanon par pani phir saktaa he
 The main reason for this has been Aditya Thackeray's activism
 vah shivasena kii yuva ikai ke pramukh hai
 Recently, he traveled more than five thousand kilometers in Maharashtra and made direct contact with people
 isse na sirf aditya thakare kii siyaasi samaj badi balki vibhinn vajahon se charchaa main bhi rahe
 This is the reason why Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut even said at a rally that his party would not like the post of Deputy Chief Minister
 ishaara saaf tha ki shivasena siton ke maamle main majboot banakar ubhartee he to vah mukhyamantri ke pad par samjhauta nahin karegi
 Also read: Shiv Sena's eye on the post of Deputy Speaker, Sanjay Raut said - This is not our claim, the Shiv Sena's expectations are being broken by the estimates of exit poll of Maharashtra India today-axis My India on Monday
 agsit pole ke anusaar maharashtra main bijepi or shivasena gathbandhan sarkaar kii vaapasi ke asaar najar aa rahe hai
 The bjp-shiv Sena is projected to get 166-194 seats
 usamen shivasena ko 50-70 seat milane kii sambhaavna he, jabaki 109-124 siton ke saath bijepi maharashtra main badi party banakar ubhar rahi he
 After BJP emerges as a big party, Shiv Sena will not be in a position to claim the chief minister's post
 aam netaa kii bhoomika ke liye aditya taiyaar- shivasenaaditya thakare ke sawaal par shivasena kii pravaktapriyanka chaturvedigol-mol jawaab detii hui najar ain
 He told 'aaj Tak' that the picture would be clearer with the results
 vipaksh ne jaise dushprachaar kiya uske baavjood ham phir se sarkaar bana rahe hai or janata ne hamaare gathbandhan ko sweekaar kiya he
 Even if there were separate elections in 2014, the public wanted the bjp-shiv Sena to come together
 priyanka chaturvedi ne kaha kiaditya thakream netaa kii jimmedaari nibhaane ke liye taiyaar hai or unki pehali jimmedaari apane kshetra kii janata ko lekar hogi
 In the coming time, the public will be ready to fulfill whatever responsibility they give
 ye bhi padhenmaharashtra: fadanvis ke baad shah bhi bole- shivasena se nahin hoga aglaa mukhyamantripriyanka chaturvedi ne kaha ki chote bhai or bade bhai kii baat karnaa bekaar he, kyonki hamanebijepika saath diya he
 We stand on a platform on issues like Ram Mandir and 370
 hamaara makasad maharashtra kaa vikaas he, jiske liye ham patibaddh hai
 The views of political parties may vary
 vipaksh desh or rajya ke muddon ko uthaane main puri tarah se vifal rahaa he
 Shiv Sena should decide the role of Aditya Thackeray- Sudhanshu Trivedi upi chunaavon ke parinaam lagaataar aa rahe hai
 Simultaneously, Amethi and Rae Bareli, which we have been considering as Congress strongholds, are seen flowing in the BJP wave
 amethi or raibareli donon jilon main 10 vidhansabhaayen hai jinamein bijepi or sapa-congress gathbandhan ke bich sidhi takkar najar aa rahi he
 BJP is ahead or has won five seats and sp-congress alliance on 5 seats
 congress ke liye naak kaa sawaal bani amethi seat par bijepi kii garima singh aage chal rahi hai to vahiin raibareli se congress ummidavaar aditi singh jeet chuki he
 However, in the victory of Aditi Singh, less of a party can be seen as more powerful than her father Akhilesh Singh
 amethi jile kii 5 siton main se bijepi 4 siton par aage he jabaki 1 par sapa
 Similarly, out of 5 seats in Rae Bareli, BJP is leading in 2, Congress 2 and SP 1 seats
 kya hai myneribareli main kamjor congressapako yaad dilaa den ki pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main raibareli jilon kii sabhi paanch siten congress haar gai thi
 In these elections too, the Congress has only two seats
 kya iskaa myne yah nahin nikaalnaa chahie ki congress lagaataar apana garh harati ja rahi he
 This time also, one seat in Rae Bareli comes from Akhilesh Singh's family, while the SP alliance has benefited from the other seat (harchandpur) as SP had an MLA from this seat in the last elections
 aapako yaad dilaa den ki raibareli kii sabhi vidhansabhaayen sonia gandhi kii loksabhaa kshetra main aati hai
 The BJP won the remaining two seats in Rae Bareli, and SP raised its flag on one

 Acharya Satyendra Das, the head priest of the temporary Ram temple said that 'mahant' and 'sadhu' believe in Lord Rama and his only wish is to see the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya
 acharya satyendra das ne kaha, "narendra modi sarkaar dwaara satta sanbhale jane par hamane ummid kii thi ki ab mandir ban jayega
 
 
 "das said," Modi should come to Ayodhya, give us a guarantee and declare that he will get the Ram temple constructed during his tenure
 
 
 " He said, "then we will unite Hindus to vote in favor of BJP, as there are a large number of followers of 'mahants' and 'sadhus' in Uttar Pradesh

 If we support BJP, it will definitely win
 
 
 " tippaniyan Reacting to this demand of Acharya Satyendra Das, Mahant Raghuvar Sharan of Rasik Niwas Temple in Ayodhya alleged that the BJP never raised the issue in Parliament on the basis of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir movement

 " mahant raghuvar sharan ne kaha, "in logon ne sadan main kabhi ram mandir kaa mudda nahin uthaaya
 
 
 Nor did he ever demand that Prime Minister (narendra) Modi bring a proposal in Parliament for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya

 abhi tak kisi prakaar kii phiroti kii maang kii koi soochna nahin he
 The area is under the occupation of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria - ICIS
 yahaan kareeb 100 bhartiya kaamgaar hai
 The government has said that it is in contact with 46 nurses
 in nurson ne bataaya he ki ve ghayalon ke ilaaj main juty hui hai
 The government is in touch with various agencies and is making serious efforts
 kya aisa ho saktaa he ki raaton raat koi islamic sanghathan vajood main aa jaae wo bhi khatarnaak sainya kshamta or saamaanon se las or ek ke baad ek iraq ke shaharon par kabja karata chalaa jaae
 For the past six years, the western world leaders who have come out to distribute the franchise of democracy in West Asia have been behaving in such a way that no one was aware
 yah isis yaa isiel
 Iraqi soldiers are kidnapped and shot in public and released the video
 400 million dollar bainkon se lut letaa he or iraq ke kai shahar mosul tikrit faluza vagairah par kabza kar letaa he
 The situation is such that the fight stops production of Iraq's largest oil refinery
 aakhir america or britain koun se loktantr kii buniyaad daalane kaa jhansa puri duniya ko de rahe the ki 2011 main iraq se america sena kii vaapasi ke itane kam samay main ek milicia aisi takkar dene kii sthiti main aa gai he ki america sena kii vaapasi kii baat hone lagi he
 Will Iraq be shattered
 wo to saddaam ke vakt bhi nahin bikharaa jab uske niyantran se 18 main se 15 praant chale gaye the
 The Shia Sunni controversy is not new, but how did this organization emerge in such a strong form
 ise samajhane ke liye kya pratham vishwayudd ke baad france or britain ke bich hue bantwaare kii taraf jhanke yaa 2003 ke baad america or britain kii rasoi main
 After all, what democratic structure has been created there, in spite of which such a large number of people start believing in tribal identity and the power that comes from it and kill each other in the name of Shia Sunni
 kai log ashanka vyakt kar rahe hai ki isis ke kaaran iraq kaa sampradayik aadhaar par vibhaajan ho jayega
 The i-sis is definitely a Sunni organization, but it is also accused of killing the Sunnis of Syria
 internet par maujuud kai lekhon main ek lekh main yah jaankaree milti he ki iraq main chunaav ke baad ai sarkaar ne pichley saal sunni algaavvaadiyon ke khilaaf karrwai kar 800 logon ko bandi banaaya
 No one knows what happened to them
 is baar bhi shiya sainikon kii hatya ke badale sunni kaidiyon ko maar diya gaya
 What was America doing when this was happening
 loktantr ke niryaat kaa container kis bandargah par padaa hua he
 After all, what is the attitude of the countries and leaders of Islamic countries called towards such killings
 koi bhoomika he bhi yaa nahin
 Everyone knows that all the cities of Iraq depend on Baghdad for their budget and other needs

 The current Prime Minister of Iraq, Maliki, is said to be pro-american
 inaki nitiyon kii vajah se satta or sasthaaon main sunniyon kaa algaavvaad badha he
 The Defense Minister of the Maliki government is a Sunni but is considered a JB
 maliki sarkaar bhi shiya milicia par nirbhar he
 The speaker of Iraq's parliament, Osama al-nuzayfi, is a respected Sunni leader, but why his demand for a Shia Sunni balance in government was ignored
 aaj america pradhanmantri maliki se is santulan ko dur karne ke liye kah rahaa he, magar kal kya kar rahaa tha
 One expert has written that not all Sunnis are with i Sis
 sunniyon kaa ek bada tabaka raajnneetik prakriya main yakeen karata he
 But Maliki opposes
 yah bhi baat saamne aa rahi he ki maliki ne jab is sunni milicia par kaabo paane ke liye america se madad maangi to nazarandaaz kar diya gaya
 Looking at the Iraq crisis as a Shia Sunni conflict, one has to understand the remaining dreams of that era where they return and advocate the establishment of an Islamic state
 beesvin sadi ke is daur ke un sapanom ko bhi dekhnaa hoga jo america, france rus or britain ke liye kuchal die gaye
 After all, what is the reason that tribal identity sometimes emerges as Taliban and sometimes Al Qaeda and sometimes i-sis
 30 saal tak ek duusare ko aankh dikhaane ke baad iraq ke bahaane iran or america kareeb aate dikh rahe hai
 Britain has also started an embassy in Iran
 kya isse sthaayee hal nikalegaa
 Did not come out of the 2003 war
 america or britain main janamat yuddh ke khilaaf he
 Obama's anti-republican leaders are pushing for the withdrawal of US troops
 kuch raay de rahe hai ki america ko hawaii hamale karne chahie
 As if he had shown the Taliban abolition on the pakistan-afghanistan border with a drone attack
 2003 ke yuddh main saath dene vaale tony blair kehete hai ki yuddh nahin hota to halaat or badtar hote
 This situation has arisen due to premature withdrawal of army
 hamen loktantr ko bachaane ke liye lautnaa chahie
 But is there really a strong democracy in Iraq that they want to return to in 2014 after 2003 to save it
 iraq afghanistan or na jane kya kya pashchim asia ke khitton main barbaad mulkon kii dastaanen khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 This is a disease to be cured by which the US and the UK become doctors and perform operations and leave the patient in the condition that they leave allopathic and kill each other in the fantasy of establishing an Islamic Republic in the name of Greek Medicine Takes a bite
 prime time ankar ke liye raaton raat iraq par visheshgy ban janaa aasaan nahin
 Everything i read got entangled with it
 iraq or pashchim asia ko bachaane ke liye arab jagat ke deshon ko apni bachi khuchi shakti kaa istemaal karnaa chahie yaa nahin yaa sab kuch america ke bharose chhod diya jaae jo kabhi apane sainikon ko lekar utarataa he to kabhi ud jaataa he

 ' Samsung has launched its flagship Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus smartphones
 ab market main do top noch smartphone hai jinaki takkar kaaphi pehle se he
 These two new smartphones from Apple's iphone x and Samsung
 launch event dekhakar, is smartfones kii khubiyaan or spacification ko bariki se samajhane ke baad ham aapako bataate hai ki iphone x or Galaxy S9 main kis tarah se takkar hogi
 What are the similarities between these two smartphones and what features and specifications make these two different from each other
 Galaxy S9 or iphone x donon kaa dizinglass metal kaa he jo kaaphi premium he
 However, this time Apple has also used stainless steel in iphone X
 Galaxy S9 zyada patala he or jaahir he isamen karvd glass die gaye hai
 On the other hand, the camera module of the iphone x is equipped with two cameras, as is the case with the Galaxy S9
 iphone x main anemoji feechar diya gaya jo aapke chehre ke jescher ke hisaab se kaam karata he
 Samsung has also introduced the AR Animoji feature in the Galaxy S9
 yah alag isliye he, kyonki yah aapke chehre ko scan karke uski tasviir clic karke aapke jaisaa hi imagi banaata he
 The Home button was removed from iphone x and replaced with Face ID
 Galaxy S9 main fingerprint scinar bhi he or phase idi kii tarah hi facial ricognishan feechar diya gaya he jise company ne sabase sateek bataaya he
 Talking about hardware, in this case both smartphones have a tough competition
 donon hi smartphone water or dust registent hai
 Both smartphones have an OLED screen
 ek taraf jahaan iphone x main sabase tej A11 bionic chipset diya gaya he to duusari taraf samsung ne Galaxy S9 main Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 procesar diya he
 The Galaxy S9 has wireless charging and also supports fast charging
 iphone x bhi wireles charging saport karata he, lekin fast charging ke liye aapako vaisaa hi pod khareednaa hoga
 Talking about the camera, the Galaxy S9 has a 12-megapixel lens and its aperture f / 1
 5 he
 Talking about RAM, the iphone x has 3GB of RAM while the Galaxy S9 has 4GB of RAM
 donon smartphone ko aap 64GB or 256GB memory verient main kharid sakate hai
 The iphone x does not have a headphone jack and the connector has to be used for this, while the Galaxy S9 also has a headphone jack this time
 donon hi smartphone kii audio quality kii takkar nek tu nek he
 Because the Galaxy S9 has front facing speakers
 Galaxy S9 Plus or iphone x main dual camera seoup diya gaya he
 Although Samsung's primary camera aperture f / 1
 5he jo iphone x se kam he
 That is, the Galaxy S9 Plus will prove to be better for photography in low light
 baat karen agar aam photography main to ye donon barabari par hi dikhte hai
 The iphone x looks ahead in terms of better zoom 2x
 haalanki live focus boke effect or slo moshan main shaayad Galaxy S9 Plus aipal ke flagship ko takkar de
 However, it will be known only after the review, because the collision here is tremendous
 keemton ke maamle main iphone x kaa koi muqabla hi nahin he ek tarah se
 Because it is called 1 lakh smartphone i
e
 $ 999
 samsung Galaxy 800 dollar kii shuruaati keemat ke saath uplabdh ho saktaa he
 That is, there is an advantage for Samsung here
 iphone x or Galaxy S9 main 5
 There is an 8-inch display, but the iphone x seems smaller
 haalanki Galaxy S9 kaa rijolushan zyada he
 The iphone x is completely bezelless so it looks small
 jald hi Samsung ke in flagship kii bikri shuru hogi or isse pehle hi ham aapako iphone x or Galaxy S9 Plus ko video ke jariye compair karenge
 Aajtak has important documents on hand in the Asra shelter home in Patna, capital of Bihar
 isamen khulaasa hua he ki manisha dayaal or chirantan kumaar ne bihar sarkaar ke samaaj kalyaan vibhaag se aasraa shelter home chalaane kaa kaam liya tha
 For this, he used to get Rs 76 lakh annually from Nitish Kumar government
 iske liye chah farvari 2018 ko ek memorondom of anderstanding (mou) taiyaar kiya gaya, jis par aasraa shelter home or bihar samaaj kalyaan mantralay ne dastakhat kiye
 This contract was done on stamp paper of 1000 rupees
 is mou par samaaj kalyaan vibhaag kii ore se diarector ne dastakhat kiye, jabaki anumaaya human resorcej foundation (aasraa shelter home ko chalaane vaali enjio) kii ore se secretary chirantan kumaar ne hastakshar kiye
 The secretary of the Social Welfare Department is not spared from this contract, because the directors sign the MOU instead of them
 50 mahilaon ke ilaaj ke liye 1500 rupee maheene vaala doctoris emoyu ke mutabikasra shelter homeme 50 mahilaon ke liye ek doctor rakhana tha, jisko sirf 1500 rupee maheene mehtaanaa dene kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha
 Apart from this, a provision was made to spend only 500 rupees a month on medicines of these women
 is emoyu main aisi kai baaten hai, jinase pataa chalata he ki ghotaale or gadabadiyon kii shuruyaat shelter home ke khulne ke saath hi shuru ho gai thim
 These disturbances have been revealed in the initial investigation by the City Magistrate, who are registered in the FIR
 is exiaar kii copy ajtak ke paas he
 In this FIR, the City Magistrate also wrote clearly that the girls died in Asra Shelter Home due to lack of timely treatment
 in ladakiyon ke ilaaj main badi laaparvaahee barti gai or isaki vajah thi bihar sarkaar ke samaaj kalyaan mantralay se milane vaale paison kii bandarbaant
 On the stamp paper of 1000 rupees, mou Chirantan Kumar took a stamp paper of 1000 rupees to the Social Welfare Department
 vibhaag se enjio ke kaam kaa sauda final hone ke baad usne yah stamp chah farvari 2018 ko apane naam kharida tha
 Then on the same day the mou was signed with the government
 gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki is emoyu main anumaaya human resorcej foundation ke president kaa zikr to he, lekin ab tak inaki pahchaan logon ke saamne nahin ai he
 Why the curtain is being put in the name of the President of the NGO
 The question is arising that why the Patna Police investigating the case is not making the name of the President of the NGO conducting the Home shelter shelter public? It is not so in the matter that the president and members of the governing body of Manisha Dayal and Chirantan Kumar's NGO should include big and influential people
 kya police ko is baat kaa dar sata rahaa he ki enjio ke president kaa naam saamne aane se maamle main shaamil bade-bade log benakaab ho jaaenge
 76 lakh rupees were used to run the Ashara Shelter Home, this mou mentions many things
 jahaan tak aasraa shelter home chalaane ke badale bhugtan kaa sawaal he, to dastavejon se saaf he ki manisha dayaal or chirantan kumaar ko saal main kul 76 lakh rupee milte the
 According to the documents, it was decided that 50 girls or women would be kept in the Asra Shelter Home
 iske alaava shelter home main ladakiyon yaa mahilaon kii sankhya zyada hone par adhik bhugtan kaa praavdhaan bhi rakhaa gaya tha
 The expenditure of the shelter home was revealed from the mou, the entire account of every expense has been revealed from the mou
 aasraa shelter home main buniyadi vyavasthaaen 50 ladakiyon yaa mahilaon ke liye hi kerani thi
 The Asra Shelter Home housed women or girls who were mentally ill or abandoned by the family or found wandering
 emoyu se yah bhi saaf hota he ki iske liye sarkaar kii ore se kab or kitna bhugtan kiya jayega
 According to the document, payments were also made to Manisha Dayal and Chirantan Kumar from time to time
 kis cheez main kitna kharch kiya janaa he, iskaa bhi zikr dastavej main he

 isibi ke anushaasan ayog ne pichley saal june main un par england main khilne par aaajeevan pratibandh laga diya tha
 The commission found him guilty of corruption and fraud
 test cricket main 261 wicket lene vaale caneria ne aaajeevan pratibandh ke khilaaf apil kii thi, lekin anushaasan ayog apili panel ne use naamanzoor kar diya tha
 The comments unhone kaha, sabase niraashajanak yah rahaa ki kisi bhi samay pisibi ne mujhe kisi bhi tarah se madad karne yaa un sabooton ko hasil karne kii koshish nahin kii, jiske aadhaar par isibi ne daawa kiya tha ki main spot phixing main shaamil tha
 Kaneria's entire case is based on the statements of his former Essex partner Mervyn Westfield
 westofield ne apana bayaan badla tha or isibi ne adalati notice bhejne kii dhamkee dekar use apili sunwaayee main aane ke liye majaboor kiya tha
 Kaneria is the fourth Pakistani player convicted in spot-fixing in England
 purv captain salmaan bat, mohammad asif or mohammad aamir par bhi is kaaran se pratibandh laga he
 The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) had already banned Kaneria for life
 caneria ne iske khilaaf apil kii, jise naamanzoor kar diya gaya
 After this, the PCB also decided to ban them
 pisibi ne bayaan main kaha, isibi ke apili panel ne caneria par aaajeevan pratibandh ko sahi tehraaya he tathaa pisibi is pratibandh ko manyata dene, uskaa sammaan karne or use pakistan main lagu karne ke liye baadhya he
 The board said that Kaneria will not be able to play any tournament under the PCB and cannot be associated with any organization or cricket administration
 english county cricket main sitambar, 2009 ke spot phixing maamle ke khulaase ke baad caneria kaa antarrashtriya kariyar agast, 2010 main tham gaya tha
 In June last year, the ecb's Discipline Commission banned him for playing in England
 ayog ne unhen bhrashtachar or dhokhadhadi kaa doshi paaya tha
 Kaneria, who took 261 wickets in Test cricket, had appealed against the life ban, but was rejected by the Discipline Commission Appellate Panel

 Taking a big decision on Sunday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav removed Uncle Shivpal Yadav from the cabinet
 akhilesh ne shivpal samet chaar mantriyon ko cabinet se baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya
 After that Shivpal also took action and showed Ram Gopal Yadav, close to Akhilesh, a way out of the party
 puure ghatnakram ke baad shivpal kaa kahana he ki wo ab wo akhilesh ke saath kabhi kaam nahin karenge
 In an interview to the English newspaper 'the Times of India', Shivpal Yadav said that even after the SP came to power in 2017, i will no longer work as a minister in the Akhilesh government
 akhilesh ne kuch dinon pehle bhi shivpal ko mantrimandal se baahar kar diya tha, lekin baad main unhen phir se mantri pad diya gaya
 Shivpal Yadav appeared emotional on the whole matter, recalling his struggles in the party and Akhilesh's childhood days
 unhone bataaya ki vah bachapan main akhilesh ko 'tipu' kahkar pukaarte the
 He also told that for a few days, Akhilesh was looking for a chance to expel me from the party
 maine is bare main apanepariwaraur kareebi logon se baat bhi kii thi
 i found out that Akhilesh had made up his mind
 haalanki iskaa koi kaaran nahin tha
 It is believed that the reason behind Shivpal's discharge from the party is being told to his close friends with Amar Singh
 jis par shivpal ne kaha ki main akhilesh ko chunauti detaa hum ki vah bataae ki maine kastmar sinhakaa paksh liya yaa unke samarthan main koi baat kii
 i do not even talk to him, i have spoken to him only once in the last month
 kya ye aparaadh he
 i only respect him
 kyonki netaji se unke puraane sambandh hai
 We have learned to close relations with them only
 main ehsaan faramosh nahin hum

 punjab sarkaar ne 14wein vitt ayog ke saamne aarthik tangi kii baat kahi thi
 However, within a day or two of that meeting, Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal claimed that the financial condition of the state was strengthened
 lekin ise unki rajnatik laffaaji hi mana gaya, kyonki aankade duusari hi kahani kah rahe the
 Now a year has passed
 magar un aankadon ke anuroop kam kharch ke koi sanket najar nahin aae
 In contrast, in reality, the government was eager to make even more promises
 ye vaade khokhale hai yaa nahin, vakt hi batayega
 On October 19, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal once again did what seems to be his favorite work — he laid the foundation stone of the jung-e-azadi Memorial at Kartarpur in Jalandhar
 isaki laagat 200 karod ru
 Has been told
 isse pehle isi saal farvari main badal ne amritsar main 100 karod ru
 The foundation stone of the museum and memorial dedicated to war heroes was laid at a cost of Rs
 ye do udhaaharan to smarakon or sangrahalayon ke prati badal kii beintiha muhabbat ke pratik maatr hai
 The state government has announced 23 such projects since the Badal family's return to power seven years ago
 unamem se sirf teen puri hui hai or chauthi kaa mahaj pehla charan puraa hua he
 The rest of the schemes are mostly waiting for their fortunes, mainly because there is no money in the government coffers
 amritsar main sangrahalay-smarak ke shilanyas kaa elaan bahut dhooma-dhadaake or gaaje-baaje se kiya gaya
 The residents of the city say that most of the parks, statues and statues and other monuments are waiting for luck in the absence of care
 amritsar ke do sabase jane-maane parkon, shahid madan laal dhingra park or maharaja jassa singh ramgadhitha park kii haalat par sirf taras hi aa saktaa he
 Similarly, it seems that only the pigeons have a permanent interest in the statues of Jawaharlal Nehru, Shaheed Udham Singh, Subhash Chandra Bose, Mahatma Gandhi and other great men
 paise kaa intjaam kiye bagaiyr aisi pariyojnaon ke elaan kaa utavlaapan or bhi baton se sabit hota he
 The foundation stone of the Amritsar project was done in February 2014, while a letter of financial assistance for the construction of this monument was sent to the Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs in the first week of July
 janvari main badal ne bharosa dilaayaa tha ki dhan kii tangi ke kaaran kaam nahin rukegaa
 Despite this, most of the work of the project is so loose that the vote banks to make these announcements seem to be angry rather than happy
 june, 2013 main badal ne bhai mati das, bhai sati das or bhai dayaal das (mughalon ne guru teg bahadur or unke ye teen saathi shahid kar die the) kii yaad main 50 karod ru
 Announced the memorial of lekin pariyojna kii diwaar main ek eent tak nahin lagi he
 This was seen as a step taken to please the Hindus and especially the Brahmin community
 lekin shri brahman sabha, punjab ke adhyaksh pandit devi dayaal parashar kehete hai, “10,000 logon ke pratinidhimandal ke nivedan karne ke baad mukhyamantri ne ghoshnaa kii thi ki paanch acre ke plot par smarak banaaya jayega, lekin abhi tak aadharshila bhi nahin rakhi gai he
 They (the state government) have cheated us
 ”(amritsar main war hero memorial or mujium kaa nirmaan)isi tarah ferozepur jile main pakistani sarhad se lage gaanv husainivaala main aazaadee ke ranbankuron kii yaad main prastaavit smarak kaa kaam aage nahin badaae se badal ko aalochana jhelni padi he
 The memorial was announced in March 2012
 mansa jile ke joga gaanv main 1 karod ru
 The cost of a cow-memorial is also the same story
 yahaan ek factory ke najadik gau hatya kii shikaar 50 gaayon ke shav milane ke baad june, 2012 main isaki ghoshnaa kii gai thi
 Even after two and a half years, the ceremony of laying the foundation stone has not been done till the payment
 bharat main vaise bhi kai pariyojnaayen shilanyas se shuru hokar shilanyas par hi khatm bhi ho jaati hai
 Ramesh Gupta, president of Punjab Gaushala Mahasangh, complaining of 'discrimination', says with displeasure, "forget the memorial, the accused of cow slaughter is roaming freely on bail
 ”itihaaskaar bhi smarakon ke elaan kii is utaavali kii ninda karte hai
 During the foundation stone laying ceremony of jang-e-azadi Memorial in Kartarpur, Badal described it as 'a real tribute to the unprecedented sacrifice of the people of Punjab'
 vahiin amritsar main rahane vaale itihaaskaar surinder kochar kehete hai ki smarakon kii faqat ghoshnaa kar dena or nirmaan nahin karwaanaa darasal shaheedon kaa ‘apmaan’ he
 Says Kochhar, “instead of wasting money on building new monuments, the government should focus on the maintenance of existing monuments
 ”udhar jis ek or pariyojna ko virdohi sikh sanghathanon kii aalochana kaa shikaar hona padaa he, vah he 1984 ke sikh-virdohi dangon main maare gaye logon kii yaad main dilli main banaaya jane vaala smarak
 Badal announced this in 2009
 june, 2013 main dilli sikh gurudwara prabandhak cameti (dsmasi) ne isaki aadharshila rakhi
 New Delhi Municipal Council gave notice to the committee for laying the foundation without its permission
 dsmasi ke varisht upaadhyaksh ravinder singh khurana kehete hai ki cameti ne dilli ke rakabganj gurudwara parisar ke bheetar smarak ke nirmaan kaa faisla kiya he or iske liye anumati kii jarurat nahin he
 The memorial work finally began on 1 November
 ummid ke mutabik, virdohi dal congress ne smarakon par badal kii phijulkharchi ko ‘shoshebaaji’ qaraar diya he
 Party spokesperson Sukhpal Singh Khaira says that instead of 'wasting crores of rupees on monuments and museums without provision of funds in the budget', the government should pay the amount of social security pension and other schemes to the people
 india today ke yah poochne par ki jab pehle kii pariyojnaayen abhi kaagajon kii kaid se baahar nahin nikali hai, aise main or bhi zyada pariyojnaon ke elaan kii aalochana kaa ve kya jawaab denge? mukhyamantri prakaash singh badal ne kaha, “ham apni sabhi ghoshnaaon ko puraa karenge
 The question is just about the provision of resources
 kuch pariyojnaon par pehle kaam kar liya jaataa he or kuch par baad main
 But every declared project will be started and completed at the right time
 ”badal ne is aarope se inkaar kiya ki smarakon kaa nirmaan sansadhano kii barbaadi he
 He said, “we place great emphasis on preserving, enhancing and showing our national heritage and history
 jo log itihaas ko bhul jate hai, itihaas unhen bhul jaataa he

 He carries himself with such dignity Now it seems that the name of Ek Balatkari Baba will come out from under every brick of this country
 maheenaa khatm hota nahin ki koi naa koi nayaa baba balaatkaar kii tohamat liye saamne aa jaataa he
 Now in this episode, the name of a baba from Delhi has been included in the group of other rapist babes of the country
 in nae baba kaa naam he aashu bhai maharaj
 Astrology and Desi treatment shop sitting in Delhi and these Ashu brothers coming on TV have also been accused of gang rape and blackmail
 idhar, ilzaam laga udhar bakibabaonki tarah ye baba bhi gaayab
 Now Delhi Police is looking for them to deliver them to big houses
 dilli ke estro guruji yani jyotishacharya aashu bhai maharaj kii dukaan kal tak kuch aise hi chamakati thi
 Guruji's glory was such that hundreds of people used to line up in his court for hours hoping to change their fortunes
 guruji kii ek jhalak paakar nihaal hue jate the
 What rich is poor, what woman is male, what is child and what is old
 baba ke mureedon main shaayad hi koi aisa tabaka ho, jo shaamil naa ho
 But it was all about yesterday
 aaj kii baat ye he ki guruji yani aashu bhai maharaj kaa naam bhi ab desh ke namchin balaatkaari baabaaon kii jamaat main shumaar ho gaya he
 Yes, this is his newest baba who has been accused of gang rape
 or ab to ye dilli police ke krime branch ke bahi-khaaton main bhaage hue asami ban chuke hai
 In search of Guruji, the police are putting a lot of pressure on his hideout
 kal tak logon ko unka bhavishya bataanevaale, apane tone-totakon se bhaag badalane kaa daawa karanevaale guruji ab khud bhaage-bhaage phir rahe hai
 
 
 It is not that for the first time such a hypocritical Guruji's Bhanda has been burnt, but the truth is how many such innocent brothers have been caught earlier, but it is society that people caught in the clutches of such babas do not see others Rather, he himself has vowed to stumble and learn
 or jaanate hai in aashu bhai guruji par ilzaam kya he? to suniye, duusare 99
 Like 9% of the Babas, they are accused of gang-banging a woman with her son and molesting the woman's daughter
 vaaki ilzaam sun kar hi dimaag ghum jaataa he
 It is not understood that if someone believes such accusations, how to do so? However, what to do, even this is not only a charge
 peedit mahila ne isse kahin aage bad kar dilli police se fariyaad kii or dilli police kii krime branch baqayada aashu bhai ke khilaaf gang rape kii report darj kar unhen garm pani main haath dhokar dhundh rahi he
 Sometimes Hauz Khas, sometimes Rohini and sometimes elsewhere
 ab dilli ke behad posh ilaaqon main se ek hauzakhaas ke is bangale ko hi lijie
 In the basement of the bungalow, Ashu Bhai kept his home
 yahaan bhakton kii bheed hua karti thi, lekin ab seen palat chukaa he
 Guruji is missing and devotees are absent
 police kii maane to aashu bhai ke khilaaf ghaziabad kii rahanevaali ek mahila ne shikaayat darj karai he ki aashu bhai guruji ne apane ek dost or bete ke saath milakar uske saath zyaadati kii
 Raped ye silsilaa pichley qareeb das saalon se chal rahaa tha, lekin mahila ne halaat se haar kar apana munh sil rakhaa tha
 But the same lady broke the bhanda of Jyotishacharya Ashubhai when he started to take a wrong look at his now innocent daughter after the woman
 ilaaj ke naam par wo is mahila kii beti ke saath chhedchhad to kair saalon se kar rahaa tha
 
 
 this disgusting act of Guruji, the victim now warned him to hawk, but the way Ashu's brother blackmailed her and raped her for years, if she believes that she has now tried the same trick with her daughter Tried and could not keep up with this
 baharhaal, kehete hai naa ki jab paap kaa gadaa bharta he, to foot bhi jaataa he
 Probably something similar now with Ashu Bhai
 baba kii zyaadati kii kahani aam ho chuki he, kal tak apni marketing main hazaron rupee foonkanevaale baba kaa puraa tilism ek ilzaam se chakanachur ho chukaa he
 And Baba is walking around disguising himself as well as hiding his mouth
 aashu bhai guruuji aakhir he koun? or kahaan se aayaa? to aaie inkaa parichay bhi ho jaae
 This Swayambhu Baba, who runs an ashram in the posh area of delhi, was not only giving luck, but was also running a black business of fake medicines as a doctor of Ayurveda
 bhakton ko apane jaal main fansaane ke liye ye baba soshal media kaa bhi sahaara letaa tha
 When we investigated, it was found out that on social media it claimed to be a god by solving problems of people
 ye baba sirf hai profile ilaake main apana ashram hi nahin chalaata tha balki kaaphi technosevi bhi tha
 In simple language, Baba was on social media
 or uske sabase zyaada shikaar bhi isi soshal media ke zarie uske jhaansen main aate hai
 First of all, see this youtube page of Ashu Bhai Guruji
 yahaan baba ke 26 hazaar se zyaada sabskribar hai or apane is pej par baba ne likh rakhaa he
 Black Magic Expert
 yani kaala jaadu ke export
 Baba's Facebook profile says that he has a good number of followers here
 itnaa hi nahin baba tivi par aid ke zarie bhi logon ko jhansa diya karata tha
 Baba used to present himself on TV in such a way that he has all the divine power
 baba kaa farzi abha mandal aisa tha ki jaise sari krupa yahi barasaa rahe hai
 Hundreds of videos of Baba have been spread in the media
 taaki zyaada se zyada log usase judakar uske jhaanse main aa saken
 In these videos, Baba sometimes looked like a groom, sometimes in a suit boot and sometimes as a yogi
 magar baba kii asli hakeekat kya he ye ghaziabad kii peedit mahila ne kholkar rakh diya he
 However, these allegations are still there
 or baba kii sachai kaa khulaasa police jaanch ke baad bhi ho paaegaa
 In Nagpur, Anna's supporters abandoned the path of non-violence and started fighting
 arvind kejariwal kii sabha main jhadap ke baad afratfari much gai

 haul ke baahar ghantanad sanghathan ke log kalejhande lekar virodh pradarshan kar rahe the
 When a large number of people came out after listening to Kejriwal, their blood boiled over the protestors

 dilli se ralegan siddhi pahunche anna se milane ke liye prashansakon kaa tantaa lag gaya
 Anna said that her life is going on the edge of the sword
 anna ne kaha ki agar unke upar ratti bhar daag hota to virdohi unhen jeene nahin dete
 Anna told the people how they kept themselves immaculate till now
 vartmaan samay main madhyam varg kii kaamkaaji mahilaayein apni tankhwaah main se tex kii katautee ko lekar chintit rahati hai lekin ab unhen is baat kii chintaa karne kii jarurat nahin kyonki kuch tareeke aise hai, jinke jariye ve apana tex bachaa sakati hai
 Santosh Aggarwal, head (woman), Life Insurance, policybazaar

 beemaa ke tahat tex katautee kaa vikalp: haalanki beemaa ek suraksha saadhan he lekin tex bachaane ke liye yah kabhi bhi praathmik saadhan nahin rahaa he
 But still it provides the benefit of tax exemption under Section 80C and 10 (10D) under Life Insurance and 80D in Health Insurance
 eulip: nai peedi ke eulip ke prachlan main aane or yuvaaon ke bich sabase pasandida nivesh vikalp hone ke saath hi yah dhara 80si ke tahat tex chhot bhi pradaan karte hai

 isaki kai anya visheshtaayen bhi hai jaise vibhinn funds ke bich ni:shulk adla-badali, mrityu par premium se mukti, aay laabh or loylty adishan ityadi
 PPF: Public Provident Fund is one of the most popular and reliable long term investment and tax saving schemes
 pipief par byaaj kii dar sarkaar dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati he or isaki lock-in avadhi 15 varsh he, isliye yah niveshak ko kar-mukt laabh pradaan karata he
 Other options include investing in market-related products, they come with their own distinct risks but also provide good returns
 beemaa kaa chayan karnaa : naukareepesha mahilaon ke liye tex bachat ke vikalpon kii yojana banaate samay, 80di ek aisa sabase mahatvapurn section he jis par avashya dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 It facilitates deduction of taxable income on payment of health insurance premium up to Rs 25,000 per year
 swasthya beemaa prayek vyakti or khaastaur par vetanbhogi mahilaon ke liye ek buniyadi jarurat he kyonki swasthya beemaa ke liye premium kaa bhugtan karne se na keval aapako beemaa cover miltaa he, balki kai saare tex laabh bhi milte hai

 america ke videsh mantrimike pompiyone 26 june ko apni nai dilli yatra ke dauraan bhartiya videsh mantri es
 Interacted extensively with Jaishankar
 unamem donon deshon ke rishton main rukaawat paidaa karne vaale vivaadaaspad muddon par charchaa hui, unhone donon deshon ke saajha hit vaale maamalon par bhi samvaad aage badhaayaa
 Pompeo, in a special conversation with Group Editorial Director (publishing) Raj Chengappke, explained what he felt was the major milestone of the visit: Before you came to India, we would go from trade between the two countries, buying oil from Iran and arms from Russia
 There were disputes with some other issues as well
 aap pradhanmantri narendra modi or videsh mantri es
 Jaishankar also met with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval
 in mulakaaton kaa bada hasil kya he, or iske baad aap kya kahenge ki bharat-america rishte kahaan khadey hai?kah nahin saktaa ki takaraar ko lekar aapaki baat se main sahamat hounga
 Look, these are serious matters, things that friends and partners have to work on, but when i look at the opportunities that exist between the two countries — you have prime ministers here who get more votes than any other in the history of the world Are, and you share democratic values with America
 or aapke log har str par america ke saath america main or duusari jagahon par bhi mashgool hai
 What we spent a long time talking about today was how we can make it a different time, a different time
 ham apane rishton main zyada mahatvakankshi ho sakate hai
 And so, we can make these issues of trade, military and defense cooperation positive
 mujhe yakeen he ki ham aisa kar sakate hai or raashtrapati (donald) trump bhi isko lekar patibaddh hai
 Is there a big gain of discussions? It will be a real commitment
 main (bhartiya) videsh mantri se pehle nahin mila tha, isliye yah mauka milanaa bahut acha tha
 
 
 i spoke to him over the phone, and many Americans have known him since the time he was an ambassador in the United States, so there is a deeper understanding of his vision of how we can work together
 or phir, jab mujhe pradhanmantri se milane kaa mauka mila—ve do-ek dinon main hi osaka main raashtrapati (trump) se milane vaale hai
 
 
 They have to take forward what we have talked about today, but in every conversation with the Indian leadership there was a deep understanding that (not only) for the sake of both our people, but also for the region and the world, America and India There needs to be good, solid, reliable partners
 america main hamen bharat se phayda miltaa he, or ham yah bhi jaanate hai ki aapako bhi hamaare saath rishton se phayda miltaa he
 Regarding trade, India feels that the US is tightening its stance with it, especially with the withdrawal of GSP (common Preference System)
 is baat ko dekhte hue ki bharat ke saath america kaa vyapaar ghaataa takreeban 24 arab dollar he, america ne jiespi waapas lekar bharat par chaabuk kyon fatkaaraa or ise behaal karne ke liye bharat ko kya karnaa hoga?ham ise sulajhane ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 We are working to restore these relationships
 mujhe puraa bharosa he ki ham yah kar sakate hai
 i know that GSP is very important for India
 
 
 mujhe nahin lagata ki kisi ko bhi yah jaankaar hairat hogi ki vyapaar or vyapaar ghate raashtrapati trump ke liye jabardast ahmiyat rakhte hai
 
 
 i am sure that when two friendly countries work together, then we can find our way out of it
 bilkul mugalate main na rahen
 When they reach a decision on all these things, when it is finally settled, neither of the two countries will get everything they want
 harek desh ko kuch paanaa or kuch khona hoga
 
 
 But this is what friends do
 ve rishte banaate hai, ve saath milakar kaam karte hai
 
 
 And when we sort them out, we will be in much better shape
 mujhe yaad dilaayaa jaataa he, lagaataar, ki aise desh hai jinke saath vyapaar ko lekar hamaara takaraav nahin he
 (because) we don't do business with them at all! There is a long-standing economic relationship between our two countries, and it is absolutely imperative that countries that have such a deep, so strong, so economically connected relationship, then there are times when they come to that moment He is unable to solve it at all
 is ek ko bhi ham sulajhaa hi lenge
 But there is duplicity in the attitude
 vyapaar ko lekar aap sakht baat karte hai
 You speak sweetly on defense and other issues
 aisa kyon hota he?nahin, nahin, main samajhataa hum ham har cheez par sakht hai, bharat bhi har cheez par sakht he! mujhe yakeen he ki pradhanmantri modi or es
 Jaishankar is a good representative of India — our trade representatives will represent America well
 magar mujhe ummid he ki bharat ke log is baat ko samajhenge
 
 
 We have to focus on differences, on the things that are creating challenges
 ham lokeligeshan kii chunautiyon kii baat karte hai, un tamaam chizon kii jo khabaron main he
 These are small parts of the relationship
 main kaamana karata hum ki reporter donon deshon ke bich is lambey-chaude rishte kii, us lambey-chaude maukey kii baat karenge, jo hamaare—1
 7 billion people, among the democratic institutions around them
 agar ham un par dhyaan den, chunautiyon se nipatane ke liye kaam karen
 
 
 So when we solve these problems, then the matter will be different — you can keep it in writing
 dosti or saajhedaari kii yahi fitrat he
 American and Indian people should understand that this is how the relationship goes
 jab ham un par kaam karte hai, in samasyaon ko sulajhaa lete hai, tab donon (deshon ke) log itani behatar haalat main honge
 Talking about the good aspect, the US has strongly supported India, especially on terror, especially in the case of Pakistan, if you look at Masood Azhar being recently named UN terrorist, Pakistan's FATF (financial Action Task Force)
 
 
 magar lagata he islamabad ko baat samaj nahin aa rahi he
 In your conversation with Ajit Doval, did you talk about prosecuting terrorists targeting Hindustan, be it Hafiz Saeed or Dawood Ibrahim or Masood Azhar? NSA and i talked very long about terrorism, we both The commitments were then verified
 kahin bhi koi aatankwaad sweekaarya nahin he
 We talked about Iran, that is, the biggest sponsor of terror in the world, and the grave danger it poses to the world
 is prashasan ne pakistan ke saamne apni ummiden saaf-saaf rakh di hai, chaahe vah afghanistan or pakistan ke bich seemaa paar aatank ho yaa pakistan se nikalakar is desh main aane vaala aatank ho
 This is unacceptable
 hamane vah rishta badal diya he
 This is different from what used to be during the previous administration
 hamane ise kahin zyada sanjidagi se isliye liya kyonki ham maanate hai ki yah bharat ke logon ke liye, afghanistan ke logon ke liye or vahaan sulah or meljol ke maukey ke liye khatra paidaa karata he
 It is up to Pakistan not to harbor terrorists
 unke saath ham do took rahe hai
 We still have a lot of work to do
 hamen hameshaa ummid rahati he ki pakistan sahi rasta chunegaa
 i am very excited that we are able to work with India in fighting terror, of course in this area
 magar ham zyada bade falak par bhi aisa kar rahe hai
 It is a powerful partnership between two countries - fight terror, everywhere we find it
 kya aapane kuch pramukh shakhson par focus kiya—daaud ibrahim, hafiz said, masood ajahar?hamane masood ajahar ke bare main thodi baat kii
 This was a case on which we have worked very hard to bring it beyond the last point
 hamen khushi he ki yah sahi nateeja tha
 We also talked about a few different matters at some time
 main byoron main nahin janaa chahta
 NSA will talk about it if they want
 ham jaanate hai ki ye bure kirdaar koun hai, ham thik-thik jaanate hai ki ve bharat or duniya ke liye kaisaa khatra paidaa karte hai
 And the United States will be a very capable partner in pushing these threats back
 dharmik swatantraaa par america state department kii haal hi main jari report badhati sampradayik hinsa ke liye bharat kii aalochana karti he
 India has rejected these allegations
 kya yah mudda aaj aapaki baatcheet main uthaa, or is vakt aap is bare main kya kahenge?dharmik swatantraaa ke bare main maine bahut baat kii he
 Religious freedom is central to democracy
 harek insaan ko apane dharm kaa paalan karne yaa na karne kaa adhikaar hona chahie
 i know that this is at the heart of democratic values in India as well
 mujhe yakeen he ki ham do desh is disha main saath milakar kaam karte rahenge
 America is also not infallible
 ham hameshaa bilkul sahi nahin kar pate
 When we are unable to correct it, we also try to criticize ourselves
 bharat agar iran se tel kharidega to america ne us par paabandiyaan lagane kii dhamkee di he
 But India's concern is that if a fight breaks out between the US and Iran, it will have deep implications for it
 agar iran maanane se inkaar karata he to kya aisa ladaai hogi or aap bharat kii urja jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye kya karne ja rahe hai?bharat kii urja jaruraton kii khatir ham yah pakkaa karne ke liye badi lagan se kaam kar rahe hai ki use kaccha tel muhaiyaa karen or vah bhi acchhee keemat par
 America also cares about cheap energy for Indian people
 jahaan tak iran kii chunauti kaa sawaal he, to america ne takaraav kam karne ke liye vah sab kiya jo kar saktaa he
 If war breaks out, it will be because the Iranians chose this option
 main nahin samajhataa ki unhen kabhi is mugalate main rahanaa chahie ki raashtrapati trump duniya bhar main america hiton kii raksha ke liye taiyaar nahin honge, or main ummid karata hum ki duniya us jalmaarg kii raksha ke liye aage aegi jo bhartiya arthvyavastha ke liye ahm he
 Prime Minister Modi talked to me about this today
 bharat kii jaruraton kaa acha-khaasaa hissaa, keval urja jaruraton kaa hi nahin balki usase kahin zyada, hormoose jaldmarumadhya se hokar gujarata he
 There is a need to unite for open shipping by that waterway
 jab ham sanjeeda dhang se aisa karenge, tab ham hamalavar hukumat ko roak paaenge
 All we want is for Iran to behave like a common country
 rus se bharat ke es-400 kharidne ke maamle main kya aap pratibandhon se chhot kii ijaajat denge, kyonki moscow ke saath bharat ke bahut puraane rishte rahe hai?is par main pehle se kuch bolnaa nahin chaahunga
 We have expressed our concerns about that weapon system and also how difficult it sometimes becomes for America to work with those who use that weapon system; This is a real concern and i know that the Defense Force and your army will be able to solve as many technical challenges as possible
 ham iskaa bhi hal dhund lenge
 When will US President Trump visit India? Maybe soon
 pradhanmantri modi or unhen milane kaa mauka milegaa
 i am sure that the Prime Minister will invite him to come here

 PDP president Mehbooba Mufti is still in the grip of forming a government in Jammu and Kashmir and re-aligning with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 neshnal conference ke kaaryakari adhyaksh umr abdulla ne aise main unhen chunauti di he
 Omar, while addressing party workers in his constituency Birwah on Wednesday, said that Mehbooba would either form the government or be ready for the latest elections
 umr abdulla ne kaha, 'wo(pidipi) kehete hai ki gathbandhan hai
 Then he says that the alliance is not broken
 wo do tarah kii bhashaa bol rahe hai
 Mehbooba ji, form a government and if your father could not reach the people then you should reach him
 agar aap sarkaar nahin bananaa chaahati to bhagwaan ke liye is vidhansabha ko bhang kiijie or logon ko faisla karne dijie
 Abdullah said that the PDP is afraid of fresh elections in the state because of its ten-month failed tenure
 unhone kaha ki ye baat hairaan karne vaali he ki logon ko pidipi-bijepi kii sarkaar ke mukaable rajyapal ke shashan ke dauraan prashasan zyada prabhavi or asardaar laga

 unhen pataa he ki agar jammu-kashmir main aaj taaja chunaav karaae jaaen to neshnal conference hi jeetegi
 The National Conference will form the government on its own without any alliance
 isliye wo chunaav nahin karana chaahate
 Omar said that people will not tolerate this deliberate delay of PDP
 unhone kaha, 'pichley saal mufti sahab ne bhi yahi kiya tha
 But the situation was different at that time
 2014 kii baadh ke baad log raahat or punarvaas kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 When the mufti made people wait, they became restless
 log chaahate the ki sarkaar bane or jab bijepi-pidipi saath aae to logon ne virodh nahin kiya
 Mehbooba is also working on this plan nowadays
 unhen lagata he ki wo logon ko intjaar karaayengi or log phir se baichaiyn hokar unhen kisi bhi tarah sarkaar banane ke liye kahenge

 Leena Mariya, who was killed by the Delhi Police two years ago, is now in the custody of the Mumbai Police
 wo bhi apane puure gang ke saath
 In fact, Leena Mariaper, along with her boyfriend, is accused of cheating several hundred crores of rupees and she did all this cheating only to fulfill her expensive hobby
 khubasurat chehre ko agar khatarnarak dimag kaa saath mil jaae to phir astabal main sirf arabi ghode hi najar aaenge
 Just this power of this charming but tricky heroine brought her to the stables and created a complete convoy of the world's most beautiful and expensive cars
 jaraa sochie, jab ek se chaar karod tak kii kaaron main baithkar wo nikalati hogi duniya ko chuunaa lagane to bhala uski bhaukaal or khubsuurati ke jaal main koun khud ko naa fansaa detaa hoga? ji haa, tollywood yani dakshin kii filmon se bollywood main entry maarane vaali or jon abraham kii charchit film 'madras cafe' kii heroin leena maaria kii jo kahani saamne aa rahi he use dekhte hue khud pulisavaale use 'ladi natvarlaal' se kam khitaab dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 Leena, a fake investment company opened by Mumbai Police, is accused of looting more than a hundred crores of rupees across the country in the last three years
 apane bwoyfriend chandrashekhar ke saath milakar usne ek aisi farji investment company kholi, jisane logon ko das guna zyada rakam dene kaa vaada kiya
 But when it came time to pay the money, both of them grabbed crores of rupees by making excuses
 police kii maane to leena ne jinhen chuunaa lagaaya he unamem kuch rashtriya bank tak shaamil hai or ye sara kaam wo apane premi ke saath mil kar karti thi
 This is not Leena's first arrest
 isse pehle wo dilli or chennai police ke ek jwoint oparation main pehle hi dilli main giraftaar ho chuki he
 But despite being released on bail, Leena did not desist from her racket
 chalbaaj heroin kaa khulaa khelmumbai police ne leena ke paas se 6 karod se zyada kii kaaren baraamad kii hai
 Imported watches and Leena's phone are also worth crores
 kamaal dekhie ki do saal pehle yahi leena jab dilli main pakadi gai thi tab bhi kai chaunkaane vaali chijen saamne ai thim
 For example, she was hiding in a luxurious farm house in Delhi to escape from the police
 sirf farm house kaa kiraaya vah chaar lakh rupee maheenaa de rahi thi
 The 9 most expensive cars used to be parked in the farmhouse
 khud kii suraksha ke liye bhi leena ne teen lakh maheene par chah bounsar rakhe hue the
 Who would not be surprised to hear such hobbies of the daughter of a minor engineer working in Dubai
 jabaki modelling or filmi parde par aae hue use abhi sirf chaar saal hi hue hai

 bwoyfriend pehle se karata tha thagipulice ne bataaya ki leena kaa bwoyfriend chandrashekhar pehle se thagi ke dhandhe main tha
 In such a situation, when the trickster heroine came along, the business went on and on
 donon milakar laal batti kii kaaron yaa phir mahangi kaaron main aam bijnesaman se lekar sarkari bank ke senior afasaron se milte
 Maria would have been used as a 'baby doll' in these meetings
 bwyfriend deal karata or heroin apni dilkash adaaon se un deal ko anjaam tak le jane main madad karti
 Who is Leena, whence Isla In 2011, after completing her studies from Dubai, Leena Maria arrived in Mumbai to try her luck in the modeling world
 vahiin uski mulaakaat shekhar reddy urf balaji se hui
 Moving around in expensive vehicles, wearing expensive clothes and five star living soon brought Maria closer to Balaji
 donon main pyaar ho gaya
 Balaji then got Maria some modeling assignments and then took her to Chennai
 chennai main maaria ko balaji kii madad se kai filmon main heroin kaa lead role mila or wo dakhte hi dekhte tollywood main mashhoor ho gai
 While spending time together, Maria came to know that the means of Balaji's earnings were fraud
 farrotedaar angreji bolne vaala balaji khud ko iees afasar bataakar nae-nae project paas karaane ko lekar aam bijnesaman se paise letaa yaa phir bank se lone
 After that, he would slip the money as soon as he got his hands
 baad main is kaam ke liye usne maaria ko apana partner bana liya
 Apart from the IAS officer, a relative of politicians used to tell himself, Balaji would sometimes call himself the grandson of former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Karunanidhi and sometimes a close friend of Nikhil Gowda, son of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda
 chennai police ke mutabik balaji or maaria ke khilaaf chennai main alag-alag hisson main dhokhaadhadi ke sau se zyada maamle darj hai
 The exploits of these two came to the highest headlines when Balaji took a loan of 19 crore 75 lakhs from Canara Bank, Chennai with the help of Maria and then both disappeared after getting the loan amount
 police se bachane ke liye maaria or balaji may 2013 main chennai se bhaag kar dilli aa gaye or farm house main kiraye par rahane lage
 At present, the police is engaged in investigation that, during their stay in Delhi, to whom did these people be defrauded and where did the nine expensive cars come from? Since no case has been filed against Maria in Delhi yet, Chennai Crime Branch has taken her to Chennai on transit remand after the arrest of Leena Maria
 jabaki dilli police balaji kii abhi bhi talash main juty he

 bihar main jari siyaasi khinchataan ke bich mangalvaar ko mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne ek baar phir gend lalu ke paale main daal di
 In the meeting, Nitish Kumar made it clear that corruption will not be tolerated at all
 jediu ne lalu prasad ko tejasvi yadav par karrwai karne ke liye chaar din kaa ultimatum diya he
 It is clear from Nitish Kumar's decision that he has taken seriously the allegations of corruption against Tejashwi Yadav
 yani saaf he ki wo kisi keemat par tejasvi ko dipti siem ke rup main nahin dekhnaa chaahate
 After the meeting with JDU leaders, Nitish gave a clear signal to Lalu Prasad Yadav that he should take Tejashwi's resignation on his own
 argedy ne kiya tha tejasvi ke istife se inkaarek taraf nitish chaah rahe hai ki lalu yadav khud apane bete ko dipti siem pad se hataaen
 On the other hand, after the meeting of RJD held at Lalu Prasad Yadav's house on Monday, the party made it clear that the question of Tejashwi Yadav's resignation does not arise
 aamane-saamne nitish-lalutejasvi yadav par unki apni party argedy or gathbandhan party jediu ke stand ko dekha jaae to donon ke bich talwaar khinchi najar aati he
 However, it was also revealed that Nitish Kumar had a conversation with Lalu Yadav on the phone before the RJD meeting on Monday
 bataaya ja rahaa tha ki donon ke bich mahagathbandhan ko bachaane or bihar ke siyaasi bhuuchaal ko rokane par mantranaa hui thi
 But from the meeting of the two parties in two days, the stance has emerged, it is clear that there is going to be a big storm in the politics of Bihar
 nitish ne isliye diya ultimatumdarasal, ravivaar ko nitish-lalu kii baatcheet or jediu ke sakht ravaiye ke baad ye mana ja rahaa tha ki somvaar ko lalu yadav tejasvir ke khilaaf kadaa faisla lekar vipaksh ko khamosh karne kaa daanv khel sakate hai
 There was also news that in place of Tejashwi, Lalu's second son Tej Pratap Yadav can live this responsibility
 magar argedy kii meeting main aisa kuch nahin hua
 Rather, the party leaders strongly claimed that Tejashwi Yadav remained
 bihar: tejasvi ke saath khadaa hona kyon he RJD or lalu kii majaburi?vipaksh kii meeting main nahin lenge hissaaek taraf nitish kumaar jahaan argedy se aar-paar ke mood main dikh rahe hai, vahiin duusari taraf rashtriya raajnneeti main bhi wo vipakshi kheme se duuri banaate dikh rahe hai
 Nitish Kumar also did not participate in the opposition camps meeting held in Delhi on Tuesday for the Vice Presidential candidate
 isse pehle nitish raashtrapati ummidavaar ko lekar bulaae gaye congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke lunch main bhi shaamil nahin hue the
 At the same time, Nitish Kumar has also said from the public forum that he does not need to learn anything from the Congress, because he himself has deviated from the paths of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru
 raashtrapati ummidavaar kii baat ho yaa piem modi ke notebandi ke faisle kii tarif, nitish kumaar pichley kuch vakt se har raajnneetik morche par bijepi kii taraf hi jhukate najar aae hai
 At the same time, BJP has also publicly announced that if Nitish breaks the alliance with Lalu, then he is ready to support Nitish to form a government in Bihar
 aise main ab is baat kii ashanka zyada he ki agar chaar din ke andar argedy tejasvi yadav ko dipti siem pad se nahin hataati to nitish paala badal sakate hai
 Sharad Yadav came in support of Lalu amid Nitish's 'silence', said - Action against coalition jila faridabad main bhoot-pret utaarne ke bahaane vivaahita se balaatkaar karne ke aarope main ek tantric sahit uske sasuraal waalon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya he

 According to sources in a TV channel that ran the speech, during the speech we ran the disclaimer and clearly stated that it is an advertisement

 There was a lot of uproar in Parliament on Friday over the alleged statement of Home Minister p Chidambaram against North India and demanded his resignation
 lekin chidambaram ne sansad ke baahar vikiliks daavon kii bhartsana karte hue kaha ki is cabel ko mahatv dekar use pratishtha nahin di jaani chahie
 In both houses of Parliament, Chidambaram became a target of BJP, SP and RJD members for his alleged statement that if only the southern and western parts were there, India would have progressed much more
 baari hangaame or narebaaji ke bich sapa, rajd, bhaajapa or shivasena sahit kuch dalon ke sadasyon ne chidambaram kii bakhrastagi kii maang kii

 The uproar over the alleged statement of Chidambaram led to the adjournment of the Lok Sabha for 45 minutes and normal functioning could not take place later, which led to the adjournment of the House indefinitely ahead of schedule
 donon hi sadanon main sadasyon ne chidambaram kii kathith tippanee par kadi aapatti jataai
 Raising the issue, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav in the lower house said that Chidambaram, despite being the home minister of the country, made comments against national unity
 unhone kaha ki sabase gambhir baat yah he ki chidambaram ne ek videshi rajdoot se yah baat kahi he
 Members of his party shouted slogans demanding the sacking of the Home Minister
 sapa sadasyon kaa bhaajapa saansadon ne bhi samarthan karte hue chidambaram par hamalaa bolaa haalanki, us samay chidambaram sadan main maujuud nahin the
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal tried to pacify the members by saying that the contents of wikileaks should not be believed
 rajyasabha main sapa ke ram gopal yadav ne yah mudda uthaate hue kaha ki chidambaram ne apni tippaniyon se desh kaa apmaan kiya he
 This puts the unity of the country at risk
 unhen apana bayaan tatkaal waapas lenaa chahie
 The BJD, JD u and RJD mps supported Yadav's point
 up sabhapati ke rahamaan khan ne haalanki kaha ki vikiliks kii vishaywastu kii pramanikta par vishwaas nahin kiya ja saktaa he

 yah karishma kar daalaa he australia ke aled kairi ne
 Playing for the Golden Point Cricket Club, Carrie has done the job of dismissing all six batsmen, not three-four in an over
 kairi ne apane 9wein over main kiya yah ajobavictoria main bolerat cricket association toornament ke dauraan east belart ke khilaaf match main 29 varshiya kairi ko apane pehle aath overon main ek bhi wicket nahin mila tha,lekin 9wein over main unhone kuch aisa kar dikhaaya ki unka naam surkhiyon main chaa gaya
 The score of the opposing team was 40 for two in that over, which was reduced to 40 for 8 after the end of their over
 iske baad ke do or wicket bina koi ran jode gir gaye or puri team usee score par dher ho gayi
 One hat-trick after another in the same over, let alone one hat-trick, Allred Carrie made two hat-tricks one after the other in the same over
 kairi ke 9wein over kii pehali gend par ballebaaj slip main kaich hua, duusari gend par wicketiper ne kaich pakadaa, teesri gend par batsman elbeadblyoo ho gaya
 The remaining three later batsmen were bowled by Carrie
 'hyperloop' ye shabd aapane haal main kai baar suna hoga
 If not, give it carefully, because it is an interesting concept
 isaki shuruyaat sochane waalon ke hisaab se ye ek krantikari concept he, transportesan kaa paanchavaa mod kahala rahaa he
 These dimensions of hyperloop transportation after airplanes, trains, waterways and road traffic
 to aakhirkaar is hyperloop main itnaa alag kya he jo ise transportesan kaa ek alag mod bana rahaa he or kyon duniya bhar kii do darjan se zyaada companiyaan jaddojahad main lagi hui hai is concept main safal hone main or kya he is sabakaa rishta testla jaisi electric car banane vaale ilon musk se? While being stuck in traffic, you must have thought that if you had a chopper or helicopter, you would have been able to get out of there, but Elon Musk, who started the Tesla car and Space x company, came up with a different idea
 unhone upar kii jagah neeche jane kii sochi
 He thought that if there is a tube in the place of roads in which the capsule carts can go from one place to another, then how would it be
 or isi idia se dimag main hyperloop kii baat ai
 a transportation in which the ride or luggage will be able to move from one place to another at a speed of about 1200 km / h, from below or above the ground, more than a thousand kilometers per hour
 hyperloop Yes, if you are thinking that this is a concept, a dream in the world of technology, then you are not thinking wrong
 ye vaaki ek sapana hi he, jise shuru main to ek hi shaks dekh rahaa tha, par ab duniya bhar kii darjan bhar timen dekh bhi rahi hai or sach karne main bhi lagi hui hai
 We keep watching high speed trains in the world, where there is competition in Europe and China
 par in trainon kii raftaar ko zyaada se zyaada badhaane kii disha main sabase bada adnga lagata he friction kaa yani gharshan kaa
 Whether it is wheels or wind, and as the speed increases, both increase
 vahiin hawaii jahaaz itani raftaar isliye pakad pate hai kyonki wo kam dabaav vaale ilaake main udate hai
 So with hyperloop, the idea is to eliminate this friction and pressure through a vacuum pipe
 par ye sirf idia tha
 Hyperloop hyperloop concept darasal ek aise transportesan kii baat karata he jisamen aanshik rup se vaikum pipe main se transportesan capsule yaa pod ko ek jagah se duusare jagah par, hawaii jahaaz kii raftaar se bheje ja saken
 This will be possible due to the power from the electric motor, the controlled magnetic levitation i
e
 the ability to float in the air by magnetic force and the friction reduced by the minimum pressure of the air in the pipe
 filhal to is transportesan ke liye alag-alag raftaar clem kiya ja rahaa he, par haal main hyperloop van ne jo raftaar apane duusare test main hasil kii thi wo thi 310 kimi prati ghante kii
 In fact, Elon Musk is an industrialist known for his innovative ideas
 ek saath kai alag alag idia par kaam karne ke liye bhi jane jate hai
 So this Elon Musk, who owns the world-famous electric car 'tesla', owns Space X, a company working on making cheap travel in space and building colonies on Mars, he announced a challenge in 2013
 In which teams were invited to make a pod or transportation capsule that can travel in a vacuum pipe
 team aaen or apni apni soch or takanic lagaakar is transport ke mod ko sapane se haqiqat main badalen
 And now about two dozen teams are finalists in this challenge
 ye timen naa sirf kampitishan main hissaa le rahi hai balki is transportesan ko haqikat banane kii disha main aage bhi bad chuki hai

 Hyperloop is res main hyperloop van iklauti company ban gai he jisane chalata phirata hyperloop bana liya he
 It has also been tested in two phases
 company ne newada ke registan main 500 meter kaa test loop banaaya he
 In which, in the successful testing of the second phase, Hyperloop One XP1, First Generation Pod caught a speed of 310 km / h
 yahi nahin jo asal concept he, yani kam pressure vaale tub main trek se upar uth kar glide karne kaa, wo bhi is pod ne kiya
 Accelerated to 300 meters, ran up the track due to magnetic levitation or magnetic force, and finally stopped by braking
 is testing ke saath company ne daawa kiya he ki unki technolji kaam kar rahi he or wo duniya bhar kii companiyon or sarkaron se gathjod karke aise model ko banane kii yojana bhi bana rahi he
 At the same time, India's team also united to participate in this competition, which is named Hyperloop India

 Hyperloop One is claiming that up to twenty thousand riders can be sent every hour by sending riders to their pods in ten to ten seconds

 It was kept open source, which meant that any scientist engineer could work on this idea

 Currently, different speeds are being claimed for this transportation, but the speed Hyperloop One recently achieved in its second test was 310 kmph
 darasal, ilon musk ek aise udyogpati hai jo apane nae navele idia ke liye jane jate hai
 Also known for working on many different ideas simultaneously
 to is ilon musk ne, jo duniya bhar main nami ilketric car ‘testla’ ke maalik hai, antariksh main sasti yatra karwaane or mangal grah par kollani banane par kaam karne vaali company spes eks ke maalik hai, unhone 2013 main ek chalange kaa elaan kiya jisamen tiimon ko aamantrit kiya gaya ki wo ek aise pod yaa transportension capsule banaaen jo ek vaikum paip main safar kar saken
 Come to the team and apply your own thinking and technique to transform this transport mode from dream to reality
 or ab is chalange main lagbhag do darjan timen finlist hai
 These teams are not only participating in competition but have also moved towards making this transportation a reality
 sarkaron se baaten ho rahi hai
 Talking with local agencies
 privet companiyaan fund kar rahi hai
 Sponsorships are being mobilized to make hyperloop the truth
 hyperloop In this race, Hyperloop has become the only company to have a moving Hyperloop
 isaki do fez main testing bhi ho chuki he
 The company has built a 500-meter test loop in the Nevada desert
 jisamen duusare fez kii safal testing main hyperloop van ekspe 1, first jenereshan pod ne 310 kimipratighante kii speed pakadi

 300 meter tak exiliret kiya, magnetic lavittesan yaa chumbakeey taaqat kii vajah se trek se upar uthe hue dauda or akhir main brake laga kar rukaa
 With this testing, the company has claimed that their technology is working and is also planning to build such a model by collaborating with companies and governments around the world

 yadi ise dilli main yojit hi kiya jaataa he to bavana jaise bahari kshetron ko kyon nazarandaaj kar diya jaataa he
 Aiyar, a bitter critic of the Games, said, "manipur is a small state
 i won the most medals in the National Games when i was the Sports Minister
 yadi (rashtramandal khelon ke anumaanit kharche) 35 hajaar karod rupee ko manipur main kharch kiya jaataa
 If we had got the Commonwealth Games done there, it would have been a terrible answer to the terrorists
 ’unhone kaha, ‘imphal main bahut acchhee suvidhaayen hai phir is tarah ke khelon ko baar baar dilli main hi kyon yojit kiya jaataa he
 Iyer also took a dig at Suresh Kalmadi, the chairman of the Games Organizing Committee, and said that he was not called to the National Games despite being the country's Sports Minister
 unhone iske saath hi kaha ki khelon kaa aayojan bahari dilli ke bavana main kyon nahin karaayaa jahaan badi sankhya main anusuchit jati ke log rahete hai
 He said, 'is this area only for garbage dumping? aap logon ko kya sandesh de rahe ho
 ' indian medical association (ieme) ne doctoron ke saath marpet kii ghatnaon ke maddenjar ek survey kiya he
 According to a survey report released on the occasion of National Doctor's Day, most doctors in India remain tense and the main reason for this is the fear of violence
 indian medical association (ieme) ne haal hi main yah surveykshan karaayaa he
 About 82 according to this

 2 percent of the doctors were afraid of the lawsuit, while 13
 7 pratishat doctoron ko aapraadhik abhiyojan kaa dar tha
 National President of IMA dr

 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah online surveykshan 15 dinon main karaayaa gaya
 It was attended by 1681 doctors, including specialist doctors from various fields
 nattejey yah tathy sabit karte hai ki doctor jo kar rahe hai, usase ve bahut khush nahin hai

 Patnaik said that the central law gives one year to enact the relevant law, but the Odisha government will do it in a month
 rajyamantrimandal se is prastaav ko manjuuri milane ke baad mukhyamantri ne yah ghoshnaa kii
 He said, 'the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers will also be under the purview of this state law
 ' unhone daawa kiya ki unki sarkaar ne bhrashtachar se nibatane main hameshaa kadaa, prabhavi or nazeer vaale kadam uthaae
 Improving transparency and supplying public services is his government's priority
 patnayak ne kaha, 'bhrashtachar se ladane or saarvajanik jivan main paardarshita laane kii apni patibaddhta ke tahat rajya sarkaar yah kanoon banaaegi
 He cited the Special Courts Act and the Public Service Supply Act in this regard
 ling ke aadhaar par mahilaon ke saath anyaay ek vaishvik samasya banati ja rahi he
 Therefore, there is a strong need to break the mindset and social system that encourages this injustice, said the jamaat-e-islami Hind General Secretary, Mohammad Salim Engineer, in a presidential speech of the seminar on 'gender Justice and Society' held in New Delhi on Wednesday
 i said mohammad saleem ejeeniyar ke mutabik samaaj kii zyaadaatar reeti-rivaajein or paramparaayen mahilaon ke saath anyaay karti hai
 Even in those countries that call themselves champions of women's freedom, the condition of women is not better
 kyonki samaaj ne vahaan vivaah, talaak aadi kii vyavastha ko lagbhag nasht kar diya he
 This seminar was part of the Muslim Personal Law Awareness Campaign (23 April-7 May) being run by the islamic-hindustan Hindustan
 rajendra bhawan main yojit is seminar ko sambodhit karte hue unhone kaha ki islam ne mahilaon ke nyaay ko sunishchit kiya he
 He told that the acceptance of the woman is mandatory for the marriage, and that she has the freedom to break away from the marital contract through Khula
 use viraasat main hissaa miltaa he
 Widows and divorced have the right to remarry
 teen talakapar bolte hue ejeeniyar mohammad saleem ne kaha, "yah dharna failaai ja rahi he kimuslim samaaj or ol india muslim personal lau bordek baar main teen talaak kaa samarthan karata he
 This is completely wrong
 koi bhi ek baithak main teen talaak ko pasand nahin karata kyonki yah islam kii shiksha ke khilaaf he, ise roka janaa chahie
 He clarified that some sinister efforts are being made to implicate triple talaq so that a system is imposed on Muslims
 duusare samudaay ke sadsy nyaayalay ke madhyam se apni patniyon ko talaak dete hai
 They also want to apply the same system to Muslims
 lekin ve khulkar ise bayaan nahin karte balki pichley daravaaje se samaan naagarik samhita laane ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 On polygamy, the secretary-general said that surveys and census have proved wrong that all Muslims have more than one wife
 bahuvivaah koi nirdesh nahin he balki yah kuch saamaajik samasyaon kaa hal he
 Such as the problem of increasing the number of women or the rehabilitation of widows and divorced women
 bahuvivaah main chaar patni rakhane kii seemaa tay he
 This is also the case when the husband can ensure equal justice with all the wives

 Micromax, the largest manufacturer of handsets in the domestic market of mobile phones in India, sold Rs 16 crore in 2006-07
 kaa kaarobaar kiya
 After this success, the owner of the company Rahul Sharma and his three fellow founders thought that in a few years, they would increase the company's business to Rs 1,000 crore
 tak le jaaenge
 Then there was no exact account in his mind
 lekin mahaj saat saal main hi micromax kaa kaarobaar 500 guna badhkar 2013-14 main 7,500 karod ru
 Is done unka formula bahut sidhaa tha—graahakon ko vah handset muhaiyaa karo, jisaki unhen chahat he
 For example, the QWERTY 'Q' series in 2009, the Swarovski studded bling series for women in 2010, and more recently the Android Touch phone
 ye sabhi phone bazaar main sabase kam keemat par utaare gaye
 Micromax's major competitors have also changed a lot in the last seven years
 feechar phone ke daur main uskaa muqabla nokia se tha
 When Qwerty rose, it was competing with Blackberry
 or ab smartf phone ke daur main samsung or appal se hode he
 At a time when Nokia and Blackberry are constantly struggling to maintain their credibility in the market, Micromax is becoming stronger
 bendle continental jiti (british brands kii car) kii sawari karne vaale rahul sharma ab bada sapana dekh rahe hai
 They want to be among the top five companies in the world in the coming five years
 yah yatra shuru ho chuki he
 In January, Sharma went to Moscow to launch the Micromax brand in the Russian market
 srilanka, bangladesh or nepal ke bazaar main pehle se hi company kii maujuudagi he, lekin ye desh saanskrithik rup se or upabhoktaaon kii maang ke maamle main bharat jaise hi hai
 Micromax is one of the three top selling handsets in these countries
 rus alag desh he, isliye vahaan chunauti bhi alag tarah kii he
 The smartphone market in Russia is quite large
 vahaan kareeb 40 fisadi log smartphone kaa istemaal karte hai, jabaki bharat main yah sirf 19 fisadi he
 The smartphone accounts for about 60 per cent of Micromax's business, and it continues to grow
 isliye smartphone ke bade bazaar main company kii maujuudagi kaa apana arth he
 Sharma also sees Russia as a gateway to Eastern Europe, which has a large retail market like India
 america or pashchimi europe ke deshon kii tarah vah operataron se sanchalit hone vaala bazaar nahin he
 Sharma said at the recently held India Today Conclave that his next destination is Romania
 unhone bataaya ki micromax kii najar check ganraajya, hungary, poland or slovakia jaise us kshetra ke duusare deshon par bhi he
 He said, "if we succeed in Russia, then there will be an immediate penetration in these countries
 ”sharma ko rus main apana brands launch karne main saal bhar lag gaya
 Micromax sees this as an opportunity because despite being a leader in the Russian market, Nokia is now confined all over the world
 sharma ne koshish kii ki unke utpaada sabase alag dikhne chahie
 Successful products like Canvas and Bolt have made changes in design and apps to suit Russia's needs
 jimail kii jagah mail
 RU is designed, Russia's largest email service
 in phone main fasebuk ke alaava odnoklassniki he, jo fasebuk kii hi tarah ek soshal netwarking ap he
 Yandex has it in place of Google search
 60 fisadi roosi log yandex main hi search karte hai
 Micromax's international earnings are still very low
 abhi yah 10 fisadi se bhi kam he, lekin sharma ko yakeen he ki paanch saal main yah kamai kul kaarobaar kii aadhi ho jaaegi
 He says, "we are investing millions of dollars to take the company forward
 ” ve bataate hai ki rus main company ke vistaar ke liye 100 karod ru
 There are plans to invest
 duniya bhar main pair pasaarne kii micromax kii yah koi pehali koshish nahin he balki iske pehle bhi company ne kai baar yojanaayen banaain, lekin vah safal nahin ho pai
 In April and May 2010, the company planned to expand to Nigeria and Brazil, but it did not succeed
 sanyukt arab emirate main uski maujuudagi thi, lekin emirate buniyadi rup se smartphone kaa bazaar tha or us vakt micromax ke paas smartphone kaa kaarobaar hi nahin tha (company ab bhi pashchim asia main kearfor, excion or lulu jaisi kuch retail siries ke jariye bikri karti he, lekin choti dukaanon main uski maujuudagi nahin he)
 Hence Micromax postponed its international expansion plans in 2010
 idhar bharat main bazaar teji se bad rahaa tha or smartphone lokapriy ho rahe the
 Vikram Jain, the second co-founder of Micromax, says, "we had a fresh look and planned to focus on India first
 ”2011-12 main ek baar phir company ubhari
 The company was now fully automated or automated
 micromax ne nae sire se risource planning kii or customer relation management par amal kiya
 He made smartphone and feature phone units
 kamai 34 fisadi ghatakar 1,600 karod ru
 But, the next year it more than doubled
 ab aarthik rup se company kaaphi behatar or majboot sthiti main he or bade jokhim uthaane kii himmat kar sakati he
 According to Sharma, Micromax has no debt in its balance sheet
 ve bataate hai ki kisi bhi desh main nae sire se kaarobaar shuru karne se pehle company vahaan nivesh karegi, lekin uske baad vahaan se hone vaale munaafe kaa hi us kshetra main nivesh kiya jayega
 By accurately assessing the work, the goal has been set
 sharma kehete hai, ''ham is baat ko lekar puri tarah aashwast hai ki us kshetra se duusare saal main kamai hone lagegi
 They also say that they do not believe in taking loans from financial institutions to expand the company
 company ne abhi tak sirf tie associats or sexoiya capital se paisa liya he
 They both have a 20 percent share in Micromax
 baaki sabhi share chaaron sansthaapakon ke paas hai
 Co-founder of the company, Jain, says that to make the business easier, the share of double digits in the market of every country is necessary
 ve kehete hai, ''ham us desh main nahin bane rahanaa chaahate, jahaan ham apni maujuudagi se koi bada badlaav nahin kar sakate
 "the company has tied up with x-men series star Hugh Jackman for international appeal
 jaikaman se yah qaraar choubees ghante ke bheetar los angelis main ek film kii shooting ke dauraan pehali hi baithak main ho gaya tha
 After that there were some Skype calls and Jackman agreed to shoot the ad
 sharma kehete hai, ''hamen to yakeen hi nahin ho rahaa tha
 Micromax plans to go to two more countries besides Russia and Romania
 nae bazaaron main use bharat kii hi tarah nokia, appal or samsung se spardhaa kerani hogi
 But there is no wrinkle on Sharma's face
 ve kehete hai, ''bharat main hamane sabhi antarrashtriya khiladinnon ko chunauti di he
 If we can do this in India, why not in other countries? ”market experts say that Micromax has the potential to succeed internationally
 global research form gartner se jude telecom vishleshak anshul gupta kehete hai, ''yah sabhi maamalon main puri tarah se sakasham handset company he, jiske paas vibhinn deshon ke bade bazaaron main bikri kaa anubhav he or use upabhoktaaon kii jaruraton kaa ehsaas he
 Sharma's dream is not just about international expansion
 ve us din kii ore dekh rahe hai, jab micromax kaa vigyaapan america main phu tbaal ke sabase bade aayojan 'super ball’ main dikhaai de
 At the last 'super Ball' event in February 2014, a 30-second advertisement cost around $ 4 million
 sharma kehete hai, ''vahi meri bulandi kaa shikhar hoga
 " ek thakaan bhare din ke baad sukun bhari neend lenaa har vyakti kii chahat hoti he
 But some people feel jerky after sleeping
 kya kabhi aapane yah jaanane kii koshish kii he ki aakhir aisa kyon hota he? ek study ke mutabik, 60 se 70 fisadi logon ko sone ke baad jatke mahasoos hote hai
 These tremors are felt when the person is in raw sleep
 yani naa to puri tarah uthaa hua hota he or naa gahari neend main hota he
 Different people give different reasons behind this
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki unke sharir main tab jatke aate hai, jab ve sapane main gir rahe hote hai yaa kisi uljhan main hote hai
 According to a report, we feel tremors due to muscle cramps while sleeping
 saath hi yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki mansapeshiyon main anthan hone kaa kaaran sound or lite hote hai
 According to scientists, feeling tired, under stress or consuming too much caffeine can also cause tremors at bedtime
 haalanki abhi tak kisi bhi report yaa study main is baat kii pushti nahin hui he
 According to health experts, physical activity done in the evening time can also be a reason for the tremors
 lekin abhi tak koi thos research saamne nahin ai he jisamen sote samay lagane vaale jhatkon kii sahi jaankaree di gai ho
 According to another opinion, tremors also occur during sleep because the brain is struggling between sleeping and awakening
 yah sakriy se aaraam kii avasthaa tak pahunchane kaa sankraman kaal hota he jisaki vajah se kai baar jatke mahasoos hote hai

 bihar main gathbandhan sarkaar ke sahyogi lalu prasad ne elaan kiya, 'nitish kumaar bhi 28 disambar ko notebandi par rashtriya janata dal ke virodh pradarshan main shaamil honge
 lalu-nitish's different stance on demonetisation After the announcement of demonetisation, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was the first non-partisan Chief Minister who supported demonetisation
 nitish kii yah baat argedy ko nagavar gujri, kyonki ek taraf jahaan nitish khulkar notebandi kaa samarthan karte dikh rahe hai, vahiin duusari ore rajd supremeo lalu prasad iske virodh main aawaaj uthaa rahe hai
 Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar's stand on the issue of demonetisation is completely different and it is believed that after this unilateral announcement of Lalu, Nitish Kumar will join the rjd's protest on demonetisation
 yahaan is baat kii bhi koshish he kimahagathbandhan sarkaar main daraaraki atakalon ko isse shant kiya jaae
 Nitish Gaur had stayed away from the ban on demonetisation, it is worth mentioning that during the Bharat bandh called by the opposing parties on the issue of demonetisation, Janata Dal United kept itself away from it, while in Bihar, their coalition partners RJD and Congress took this Participated in Bharat Bandh
 haalanki nitish kumaar ne kuch din pehle kaha tha ki vah pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara maange 50 din kii samaysima ke puure hone ke baad hi notebandi kii samiksha karenge
 However, Lalu believes that Nitish will also support him in the protest on demonetisation
 argedy pramukh ne bharosa jataayaa, 'nitish kumaar ne notebandi kaa samarthan kiya he, magar vah janata kii takalifon ke saath hai or unhone mujhase kaha he ki vah 50 dinon ke baad phir se notebandi kii samiksha karenge
 Interestingly, Nitish Kumar or none of his party's leaders have commented on Lalu's unilateral announcement
 aise halaat main kya nitish kumaar you-turn lete hue rashtriya janata dal ke virodh pradarshan main shaamil honge yah bada sawaal he
