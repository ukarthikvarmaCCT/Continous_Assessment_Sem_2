 Demand to clear the way for construction of Ram temple by making laws is gaining momentum
 modi sarkaar ne is par koi faisla nahin liya he
 But the Congress is saying that the government should wait for the decision of the Supreme Court
 haalanki 25 saal pehlecongress sarkaviodhyamasale paradhyadeshlai thi jise ayodhya adhinium ke naam se janaa gaya
 The BJP then opposed it
 vishwa hindu parishad kii aguwai main bijepi ke samarthan se chal rahe ram mandir andolan ke parinamswaroop 6 disambar 1992 ko babari masjid gira di gai
 The ordinance was introduced a year later in January 1993
 tatkaaleen raashtrapati shankar dayaal sharma ne 7 janvari 1993 ko ise manjuuri di thi
 Under this, some land of the disputed premises had to be acquired by the government
 raashtrapati se manjuuri ke baad tatkaaleen grahamantri esabi chavaan ne is bill ko manjuuri ke liye loksabhaa main rakhaa
 After passing it came to be known as Ayodhya Act
 kya kaha tha grahamantri nebil pesh karte samay tatkaaleen grahamantri chavaan ne kaha tha, "desh ke logon main sampradayik sauhaard or bhaichaare kii bhaavana ko banaae rakhana jaruri he
 "BJP and RSS leaders are giving the same argument
 ayodhya adhinium vivaadit dhaanche or iske paas kii jameen ko adhigrahit karne ke liye laayaa gaya tha
 Narasimha Rao Sarkar 2
 77 acre vivaadit bhoomi ke saath iske chaaron taraf 60
 70 acres of land was acquired
 ise lekar congress sarkaar kii yojana ayodhya main ek ram mandir, ek masjid, librari, museum or anya suvidhaon ke nirmaan kii thi
 The BJP opposed the Ayodhya Act, however, the Ayodhya Act did not clear the way for the construction of the Ram temple
 bijepi ne narsimha raav sarkaar ke is kadam kaa purajor virodh kiya tha
 The then BJP vice-president SS Bhandari dismissed the law as biased, trivial and counterproductive
 bijepi ke saath muslim sanghathanon ne bhi is kanoon kaa virodh kiya tha
 Congress government had also sought opinion from the Supreme Court
 The Nenrasimha Rao government had also sought advice from the Supreme Court under Article 143 on this issue, but the Supreme Court refused to give its opinion
 sarkaar ne supreme court se poocha tha ki kya ram janbhumi babari masjid ke vivaadit jagah par koi hindu mandir yaa koi hindu dhaancha tha
 a bench of 5 judges (justices MN Venkatachalaiah, JS Verma, GN Ray, AM Ahmadi and SP Bharucha) considered these questions but did not give any answer
 supreme court ne kya kaha thasupreme court ne ayodhya act 1994 kii vyakhya kii thi
 On the basis of majority, the Supreme Court had stayed the law relating to the title suit of the disputed land
 court ne kaha tha ki jab tak iskaa nipataara kisi court main nahin ho jaataa tab tak ise lagu nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Supreme Court had supported the provision of a Ram temple, a mosque, a library and other facilities on the acquired land but also said that it was not binding on the President
 is tarah ayodhya act vyarth ho gaya
 Allahabad High Court had decided to own the land after 16 years, Allahabad High Court gave a decision about the ownership of the land
 court ne 2
 Divide the 77 acres into 3 parts
 ram lalaa (virajman), nirmohi akhaada or sunni vakf board
 Several petitions were filed in the Supreme Court against the Allahabad High Court decision
 usee kii lagaataar sunwaayee 29 oktober se honi thi
 Hearing Now next year, the Supreme Court has postponed the hearing to be held against the Allahabad High Court verdict by 2019, that it is in no hurry
 chif justise ranjan gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne saaf kar diya he ki ek nai bench tay karegi ki sunwaayee kii taarikh kya rakhi jaae
 Demand for law making, opposition RSS said that if the Supreme Court cannot give a decision soon, then the Modi government should make laws and remove the bottlenecks in the construction of Ram temple
 vishwa hindu parishad kaa saaf kahana he ki hinduon main itnaa dhairya nahin bachaa he ki vah supreme court ke nirnay kaa intjaar karen
 BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy and Giriraj Singh, a minister at the Center, demanded that an ordinance be brought at the earliest for the construction of the Ram temple
 vahiin congress or communist partiyon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko supreme court ke faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 Meanwhile, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that people want the petition related to the title of the land (title suit) to be disposed of at the earliest
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki centre sarkaar kaa supreme court main puraa bharosa he

 But India does not need any war to overthrow Pakistan, Hindustan can attack Pakistan on the diplomacy front only
 sindhu nadi jal samjhaute kii samiksha isi baat kaa sanket he
 India is reviewing the 56-year-old Indus River Agreement with Pakistan
 is silsile main jal sansaadhan mantralay kai daur kii meeting bhi kar chukaa he
 What is Indus river agreement Indus river agreement is a treaty on the sharing of water between India and Pakistan
 19 sitambar 1960 ko tatkaaleen bhartiya pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru or pakistan ke raashtrapati ayub khan ke bich is samjhaute par dastakhat hue the
 According to this agreement, control of the three rivers of the east Beas, Ravi and Sutlej was given to India while the control of the three rivers of the west, Sindhu, Chenab and Jhelum was given to Pakistan
 world bank is samjhaute main madhyasth bana tha
 Many restrictions for India The provisions made for the sharing of water under this agreement are highly disputed
 chunki pakistan kii ye nadiyaan pehle bharat main bahati hai, aise main bharat ko sinchai, parivahan or bijli paidaa karne kii ijaajat he jabaki nadi ke kinare bharat ko dam yaa anya projects banane ke liye manaahi he
 Pakistan feared that if India stopped releasing water during the war, then there would be a situation of drought and famine in its country
 kyonkisindhu basinki nadiyon kaa strot bharat main he
 However, no such situation has come yet
 2003 main jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne sindhu nadi samjhauta radd kiye jane kii maang kii thi
 The Indus River Treaty, made in 1960 to 80 percent of Pakistan's water, is considered the most generous water sharing in the history of the modern world
 iske tahat pakistan ko 80
 52 percent water i
e
 167
 2 arab ghan meter pani salanaa diya jaataa he
 Such an example of generosity in the sharing of the upper stream of the river is not found in any other water agreement in the world
 kya pakistan ko pani rokna mushkil he?yahaan sawaal ye bhi uthta he ki kya sindhu jal samjhaute ko khaarij kar dena aasaan he
 Is it easy to stop the water going towards Pakistan
 kyonki puri sambhaavna he ki iske baad pakistan antarrashtriya manch par ronaa-peetna machayegaa
 But the right of another country over the resources of any country is only when the behavior of that country is friendly
 koi bhi antarrashtriya samjhauta aatank failaane vaale desh ko pani dene ke liye baadhya nahin kar saktaa he
 According to the principle of control over the water of rivers, India has the right to the water of rivers going to Pakistan
 bharat unheen paristhitiyon main pakistan ko pani de saktaa he jab wo shubhachintak desh kii tarah vyavhaar kare
 Talking about decisions on international treaty, China has not even accepted the decision against itself in South China Sea
 haalanki pani ko rokane kii ek vyavhaarik dikkat ye he ki agar pani ko roka bhi gaya to hamen srinagar, jammu or punjab ke shaharon main baadh se bachane ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga
 But experts also say that if India builds dams on the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab a short distance and uses some water for irrigation, then Pakistan will succumb
 
 
 
 So the desert will become Pakistan Indus river is considered the lifeline of Pakistan
 sindhu ke pani se pakistan kii 90 fisadi kheti laayak jameen kii sinchai hoti he or pakistan kii 65 fisadi upjau or rihaishi jameen sindhu ke aasapaas he
 Whereas India can store Indus water on 36 lakh acres of land, which India has not yet done
 jaankaron ke mutabik agar bharat pani roak de to pakistan kaa ek bada hissaa registan main tabdeel ho saktaa he
 Not only Indus river water agreement, India has started the strategy of providing water to Pakistan on every front of diplomacy
 jang se pehle abhi bharat ke tarkash main kai tir hai jo chale to pakistan chalni-chalni ho jayega

 wadiya institute for himalayan studies ke diarector dow eke gupta ke mutabik, 'kedarnath or aas-paas kaa ilaaka bukamp ke lihaaj se sabase khatarnaak ilaakon main se ek he
 According to geologists, the Himalayas are the result of a collision between two large tectonic plates of the earth
 takreeban paanch karod saal pehle tectonic platon ke bich shuru hui takkar aaj bhi jari he
 This is the reason why a major earthquake in the Himalayas is not new
 pichley saalon main aae bade bukampon kaa adhyayan karne ke baad bhuvaigyanik is nattejey par sahamat hai ki himalay main ek bada bukamp kabhi bhi aa saktaa he
 According to experts, major earthquakes, ie earthquakes of magnitude 8 or more are likely to occur in the areas that are Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Nepal, the lowland area of bihar and Assam
 haal hi main america kii stenford uniwarsity ke vaigyanikon ne bhartiya santhaan enziarai ke saath ek adhyayan main ye paaya he ki himalay main main himalayan thrust yani emechati kaaphi sakriy he
 There are indications here that an earthquake of magnitude 8 or above can cause havoc at the reactor scale
 vaigyanikon ke mutabik emechati wo ilaaka he jahaan urasian or indian plate aapas main takaraa rahe hai
 Because of this the Eurasian plate is rising up
 kai ilaakon main is vajah se himalay ke kai hisse har saal 34 millimetre kii raftaar se upar uth rahe hai
 It is a matter of concern that there are many areas in the Himalayas where stress is gathering in the rocks
 aise ilaakon main chattaanon main tut-foot bahut zyada hoti he, lekin jin ilaakon main bade bukamp bahut dinon se nahin aae hai vahaan par jabardast bukamp kaa khatra zyada he
 According to Seismic Gap Theory by CS Dubey, HOD Professor of Geology at Delhi University, there is a possibility of large earthquakes in areas where there have not been major earthquakes for the last 100 years
 kedarnath kaa ilaaka bhi inhen ilaakon main se ek he
 After seeing the devastation in Kedarnath Dham due to the recent excess rainfall, it makes one think that if there is a big earthquake in this area, then no one can save it from the devastation

 Eventually, an alliance between RJD and JDU was announced in Bihar
 isamen jo sabase badi rukaawat thi, vah donon dhadon ne dur kar lee he
 Nitish Kumar will be the chief ministerial candidate from this alliance
 lalu yadav sahit janata parivaar ke duusare numaayidon ke bich mulaayam singh yadav ne somvaar ko dilli main nitish kumaar ko bihar ke mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya
 With this, the speculation of infighting among the Janata family in Bihar has also ended
 darasal nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar ke taur par sweekaar karnaa lalu yadav ke liye ek mushkil faisla tha
 Lalu Yadav said in the presence of Mulayam that defeating communal forces in Bihar is his priority and for this he is ready to drink any kind of poison
 unhone kaha, 'main dharmanirpeksh takaton or bharat kii janata ko bharosa dilaataa hum ki bihar kii ladaai main main har tarah kaa ghunt pine ko taiyaar hum
 We are ready to drink every kind of sip
 ham har tarah kaa jehar pine ke liye taiyaar hai
 ' vahiin bijepi kii ore ishaara karte hue lalu ne kaha, 'main is saanp kaa fan, sampradayikta ke is cobra ko kuchalane ke liye patibaddh hum
 ' haalanki sampradayik takaton ko haraane ke naam par hue is gathbandhan main kai masalon par baat baaki he
 There is also a question of seat sharing
 lalu yadav se jab is bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha ki jab dil mil gaye hai to tikaton ke bantwaare main mushkil nahin aegi
 The comments haalanki ab asli sawaal patna main he jahaan siton ke bantwaare par baat honi abhi baaki he
 In Patna on Monday, Nitish Kumar said that on behalf of both parties, three leaders will sit on Tuesday to discuss seat sharing
 dilli main hue is elaan se pehle patna main nitish kumaar ne saaf kar diya tha ki gathbandhan hone ja rahaa he
 Now, as the third partner of this alliance, all eyes are on the Congress
 jediu kah chuki he ki wo bhi saath hogi
 In fact, it was known to everyone that if lalu-nitish could not come together in Bihar, BJP would be benefited
 ab is gathbandhan ne bihar main bijepi ke liye khatare kii ghanti baja di he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, among other representatives of the Janata Parivar including Lalu Yadav, on Monday declared Nitish Kumar as the Chief Ministerial candidate of Bihar in Delhi
 iske saath hi bihar main janata parivaar ke bich aapasi kalah kii atakalein bhi khatm ho gai
 Indeed, accepting Lalu as the chief ministerial contender was a difficult decision for Lalu Yadav
 lalu yadav ne mulaayam kii maujudi main kaha ki bihar main sampradayik takaton ko haraana unki praathamikta he or iske liye vah kisi bhi tarah kaa zehar pine ke liye taiyaar hai
 He said, 'I assure the secular forces and the people of India that i am ready to drink all kinds of sips in the battle of Bihar
 ham har tarah kaa ghunt pine ko taiyaar hai
 We are ready to drink every kind of poison
 ' Pointing towards BJP, Lalu said, 'I am committed to crush this snake's fun, this cobra of communalism
 ' However, many issues remain in this alliance in the name of defeating communal forces
 siton ke bantwaare kaa sawaal bhi bachaa hua he
 When asked about this, Lalu Yadav said that when the hearts have been met, the distribution of tickets will not be difficult

 He said, 'we want to give people a chance to see the movements of Shatrughan
 jab wo apni harkaton ke chalate logon se cat jaaenge or logon ko bhi aisa lagegaa ki wo ek jaisi galtiyaan baar-baar kar rahe hai
 When they cross all limits, BJP will take appropriate action against them

 On Thursday, a van driver was beaten to death by a cow driver suspected of carrying beef in Ramgarh, Jharkhand
 ek maaruti vine se badi maatra main maance lekar kuch log chitarpur se nai sarai ja rahe the
 Meanwhile, people of Bajrang Dal and Goraksha Samiti stopped the car and threw the meat on the road near Ramgarh Bazar Tand
 police ne 12 logon ke khilaaf cese darj kiya he
 The alleged guards set the vehicle on fire, while the driver Mohammad Asghar was badly beaten, who died in a hospital in Ranchi
 jharkhand ke ramgarh shahar ke bich-bich guuruuvaar ko sadak par logon kaa ek hujum daudte or chillaate hue aayaa or unhone ek vine ko aag ke hawaale kar diya
 Not only this, they started beating the van driver fiercely

 afra-tafaripulis sent the driver to Ranchi for treatment in the city, where he later died
 vine main aag or acroshit logon ko dekh shahar main afra-tafari or bhagdad kaa maahaul paidaa ho gaya
 People did not understand for a moment what was happening in the city
 vahiin ghatnasthal par damakal kii gaadi pahunchakar jalati huimaruti vine cobujhane kii koshish kii
 However, by then it was too late the van was completely gutted

 His two-hour meeting with Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav at Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati's residence in Delhi will surely be part of the dreaded dreams that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah Must have come uttar pradesh kii donon partiyon ke pramukhon ne aabaadi ke lihaaj se desh ke sabase bade soobe kii 80 siton par apane gathbandhan ko antim rup de diya he - donon dal 37-37 siton par pratyaashee khadey karenge, teen siten choudhary ajit singh tathaa jayant choudhary ke rashtriya lokdal (RLD) ke liye chodi gai hai, or ek seat kshetreey nishad party ke liye tay kii gai he
 The SP and BSP will not field candidates in the two Lok Sabha seats of the state - Congress President Rahul Gandhi and UPA President Sonia Gandhi's constituencies Amethi and Rae Bareli - as the Congress may not be part of the 'mini-coalition' formed in the state, but the national They will have the most chances in elections
 so, is tarah haal hi main teen bade rajyon - rajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh - main jeetne vaali congress ko uttar pradesh main puri tarah gathbandhan se baahar bhi nahin kiya gaya he
 It is nothing more like a labyrinth, and this is the politics of Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh par modi-shah kii jodi kaa kabza rokane ke lakshya ko lekar rahul gandhi, mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke saath hai
 In 2009, Congress won 21 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh
 iske baad varsh 2014 main unhone sirf do siten jeetin or unki vot hissedari sirf 7
 53 per cent, which was largely met only with the forward castes
 akhilesh yadav or mayawati ke bich gathbandhan kii aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin kii gai he, or mayawati ke kareebi sahyogi satish mishra ne is baat se inkaar kiya he ki bahanji ke janmdin - 15 janvari - ko badi ghoshnaa ke liye chunaa gaya he
 But sources are confirming that all aspects have been finalized in the meeting on Tuesday, and to celebrate this, Akhilesh Yadav has replaced 'traditionally ladoos' with 'bua Ji'
 Fed his favorite sitaphal ice cream
 rahul gandhi bhale hi aupchaarik rup se uttar pradesh main bane bjp-virdohi morche kaa hissaa nahin bane hon, lekin mana ja rahaa he ki unhone akhilesh yadav se baat kii he, taaki aisi kisi yojana par kaam kiya ja sake, jisamen congress, BJP ke savarna voton main send laga saken, or rajnatik shabdaawalee main kahen, to 'vot katua' kii bhoomika nibhaa sake
 In 2017, Akhilesh Yadav had tied up with the Congress in the quest of regaining the chief minister's post, but the results were disastrous
 BJP ko shandaar jeet hasil hui
 Since then, Akhilesh Yadav leaned towards Mayawati, who had been an enemy in the past, and his alliance won a major by-election in important by-elections in areas that were considered BJP strongholds, and everyone understood that if they were united If we go, then Uttar Pradesh, the politically most important state in the country, can be tilted in the opposite direction from Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 
 
 mayawati ke dalit tathaa akhilesh yadav ke yadav sareekhee anya pichhadi jatiyon ke voton ke ekajute ho jane ke alaava vyapak rup se faili is dharna ne bhi unke paksh main kaam kiya ki is vakt mukhyamantri kii gaddi par baithe yogi adityanath (bhagava chole main rahane vaale sadhu) ke raaj main ahm prashasnic or police padon par savarnon kii tainaati kii gai he, jisase choti jatiyon ko sataane vaala 'thakur raaj' kaayam ho rahaa he
 The reasons that have boggled the bjp's woes include the angry ally - Apna Dal - which won two seats in the last Lok Sabha election
 apana dal kaa kahana he ki ve is baar kahin zyaada siton ke hakdaar hai, or ve BJP dwaara darkinar kiya janaa sahan nahin karenge, jisane ab tak uske netaaon ko uchit sammaan nahin diya he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), called the ideological patron of the party as part of its efforts to unify Hindu votes and vote for the upper castes in favor of the BJP, stipulated that the party elections in exchange for its large activist group and ground support For this, Govardhan should appoint Jhapadiya in charge of the state
 jhadpia dakshinpanthi vichaaron ke liye jane jate hai, or pradhanmantri narendra modi tathaa BJP pramukh amit shah ke kade aalochak rahe hai
 He was also the Minister of State for Home Affairs during the 2002 Gujarat riots
 yogi adityanath tathaa amit shah apane bhaashanon main akhilesh yadav or mayawati ke gathjod ko lekar nindaatmak rahe hai, lekin RSS kaa dakhal dikhaata he ki gathjod ko kitni gambhirtha se liya ja rahaa he
 Mayawati is considered obstinate by nature, and is also under some pressure due to the CBI cases she faces in alleged corruption allegations, so she is careful about when and how to make her plans public
 udhar, akhilesh is baat se bhalee-bhaanti parichit hai ki kitna kuch daanv par he, so, unhen bhi is ravaiye se koi pareshaani nahin he
 Right now, while the whole country is waiting for the announcement of election dates, important plans have been prepared
 lekin yaad rahe, aksar sirf ek phone kol se sabhi yojanaayen badal jaaya karti hai

 It is important to understand that before Modi's four firm warlords and milk can be grown, after a long gap of 10 years, once again the name has been written on the most powerful address in the country that truly deserves it

 "now the question is, in the eyes of Modi, where is Sushma Swaraj compared to National Security Advisor Ajit Doval? Doval, who has been the stern head of the Intelligence Bureau, has the problem that after retiring in 2005, he remained out of the power establishment for nearly a decade

 pienbi ghotaale par hangaame kii vajah se ek bhi din sadan kii kaarywahi nahin chal pai he
 The government is blaming the opposition for this, but former Congress president Sonia Gandhi said that the opposition is not being given a chance to speak in Parliament
 unhone kaha ki kai jaruri muddon ko congress party sadan main uthaanaa chaahati he lekin sansad main hamen apni aawaaj uthaane kaa mauka nahin mil rahaa he
 At the India Today Conclave held in Mumbai, Sonia Gandhi said, "we are not allowed to speak in Parliament
" sansad main ahm muddon par charchaa se sarkaar bhaag rahi he
 Presently the parliamentary traditions are not being followed and that is why we are raising our issues in the House by raising slogans
 'upie kii cheirperson sonia gandhi ne kaha ki atal bihari vaajapeyi sansadeey paramparaon kaa paalan karte the, lekin ab aisa nahin ho rahaa he
 He said that the way the government wants to run the House is not possible
 sonia ne kaha ki sansad bahes or charchaa ke liye he
 If there will be no debate then it should be closed
 'sarkaar se baatcheet sambhav nahin'sonia ne kaha ki zyaadaatar log sansad na chal paane ke liye congress party ko jimmedaar maanate honge kyonki hamaare saansad sadan main narebaaji karte hai
 But there is a serious reason behind this because parliamentary conventions are not being followed
 sonia se jab poocha gaya ki kya baatcheet ke jariye sadan ko sucharu dhang se chalaane kaa rasta nahin khoja ja saktaa to unhone kaha ki maujuuda sarkaar ke saath ye mumkin nahin he kyonki is sarkaar ke paas wo jajba hi nahin he
 The deadlock was overcome through negotiations in Vajpayeeji's government
 unhone kaha ki tab bhi ham vipaksh main the lekin muddon ko baatcheet ke jariye suljhaayaa jaataa tha
 Now parties like tdp-shiv Sena which are allies of the Central Government have also started protesting by coming to the well of the House
 'modi ko nahin jaanati'sonia ne kaha sadan main apni baat rakhana vipaksh kaa adhikaar he or spikar ko bhi donon pakshon kii baat baraabar sunani chahie
 When Sonia was asked what you want to say about Narendra Modi, she said, 'I have read all the Ramayana and you are asking about sita-ram
 ' sonia ne jawaab diya, 'main modi ko nahin jaanati
 As a Prime Minister, i definitely see him in Parliament or in different events in the country and the world
 lekin nijee taur par main unhen nahin jaanati

 Somewhere, the anti-social elements take the law into their own hands by wearing a purse of alleged cow guards
 to kahin go taskaron kii police se muthbhed surkhiyaan banati hai
 Meanwhile, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Hansraj Ahir has suggested that 'project Cow' should be started in the country, just like 'project Tiger'
 tiger rigerv kii tarah hi desh main kau rigerv hone chahie
 According to Ahir, in states where the ban on cow slaughter is in force, cows' sanctuary (century) should be built
 ahir kaa kahana he ki unhone ye suzav diya he or ummid he ki sarkaar is par vichaar karegi
 Aaj Tak / India Today discussed this issue in detail with the Minister of State for Home Affairs
 ahir ne kaha, 'kau rigerv yaa sancturi ke sambandh main maine suzav diya he
 Cow slaughter is banned in Maharashtra
 kanoon bana he
 Poor farmers have difficulty raising old cows or non-milch cows
 mere suzav se iskaa samaadhaan he ki desh main bahut bada van kshetra he
 Where the grass grows and goes in vain
 is ghaas ko katkar bank ke taur par banaaya ja saktaa he
 The forest area is lying vacant
 hajaaron acre jameen par sancturi bana sakate hai
 Just as there are tiger projects, tiger is a century, in the same way cow can be made a century
 'ahir ne saaf kiya ki abhi unhone suzav hi diya he, sarkaar kii taraf se vichaar nahin hua he
 According to Ahir, he used to say the same thing when he was in opposition
 ahir ne kaha ki gaay ke naam par jis tarah kii nindaneey ghatnaayen hui hai, wo nahin honi chahie thim
 The Prime Minister also condemned the violent incidents in the name of the cow and also the Home Minister
 ahir ne jor dekar kaha ki unka suzav amal main aata he to is tarah kii ghatnaayen bhi ruk jaaengi
 Where will the expenditure on building a cow sanctuary in the states come from, then Ahir's answer to this was- 'where is the expense coming?' desh main bada van kshetra he , ghaas apane aap ugta he
 There has been a belief that forests are meant only for wildlife
 meraa maananaa he ki jitne bhi prakritik saadhan he un par har praani kaa adhikaar he
 Cows, buffalo, goat grazing have come in the forests for years
 lekin unhen aisa karne se rokane ke liye maang bhi ab uthati rahati hai
 Ahir said that the Kittigar project can be made, it can also be made for the cow
 ahir ne daawa kiya ki unhone apane suzav par prakaash jaavdekar, jinke paas pehle paryaavaran vibhaag tha, se bhi baat kii thi
 Apart from this, he also spoke to Anil Dave, Minister of State for Environment
 donon kaa rukh sakaaratmak dikhaa
 When asked about the demand of some sections to declare cow as a national animal, Ahir said that citizens can make all kinds of demands from the government
 ye bhaawanaaon kii baat he
 The cow has been worshiped in the country since time immemorial
 maang par vichaar karnaa sarkaar kaa kaam he
 Ahir's attention was also drawn to the statement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on alleged cow guards in August last
 is bayaan main pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki go rakshakon kaa chola pahan 70 se 80 fisadi log asamaajik gatividhiyon main lage hote he
 The Prime Minister also advised all states to make dossiers of cow guards
 is par ahir ne kaha ki jo bhi kanoon main haath legaa, us par karrwai hogi hi
 Ahir said that the Prime Minister had strongly condemned the cow-related incident in Gujarat
 rajasthan main haal me hui ghatana kaa bhi sarkaar kii ore se sheersh str par ninda kii gai
 Ahir said that fodder is very expensive, poor farmer is unable to feed unproductive cows
 isiilie gaayon ke liye sancturi kaa suzav bahut sarthak ho saktaa he
 On the opening of the black letter of alleged cow guards in the sting operation of Aaj Tak / India Today, Ahir said that Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has taken cognizance of this and has given confidence to stop such incidents

 Munak canal is ready but Haryana is not ready to release water in it
 shila dikshit kaa maananaa he ki haryana munak nahar se pani kii supplai ko lekar apana vaada puraa nahin kar rahaa he, isse rajdhani ke kai ilaakon main pani kaa sankat bana hua he

 Actor Shah Rukh Khan has kept his charisma on screen, passion for films and record of doing most films in a year in his career spanning more than two decades
 shahrukh aage bhi isi tarah se kaam karnaa chaahate hai
 Shah Rukh, who is called the king of Bollywood, said that he has no intention of doing a lot of films at the same time, as he wants to fully enjoy the production of each of his films and does not want to get busy with other projects in the meantime
 shahrukh ko darshakon ne isse pehle film 'chennai express' main dekha tha
 The action-packed comedy earned Rs 200 crore
 ab 14 maheene baad shahrukh 'hapi new year' ke saath laut rahe hai, jo is saal diwaali par pradarshit hogi
 When Shah Rukh was asked why he had such a long gap in his films, his reply was, "I cannot do more than one film at a time
 'hapi new year' kaaphi badi film he
 The film is completed after a full 170 days of shooting
 " Shahrukh said that he never did more than one film at a time in his career
 vah saal main sirf do yaa teen filmein hi karte hai
 He said, "I never did that
 25 saalon ke kariyar main maine 55 feechar filmon main kaam kiya he
 So i cannot do more than two or two and a half films in a year

 After Barsha Kashvamil, sensation spread throughout the area
 bristben test main duusare din kaa khel khatm hone tak jaankaar or fans bhartiya jeet ko lekar atakalein laga rahe the, lekin 24 ghante ke andar halaat itane badal gaye ki ab bhartiya team ke test bachaane kii baat hone lagi he
 Actually after the bad bowlers line and length, many important questions have arisen in front of Team India
 bristben main tisare din ye gendbaaz jis andaaz main bowling karte rahe usne team india ke is pahalu ko ek baar phir khokhla sabit kar diya
 The fifth and sixth wickets of Mitchell Marsh and Brad Haddin in the first session of the third day certainly came quickly in the bag of Team India, but after that the Kangaroo batsmen dominated
 alam ye rahaa ki duusare satr main mezbaan ballebaazon ne 130 ran jode to tisare satr main 152 ran
 That is, 130 runs in 23 overs in the second season and 34 in the third season
 4 over main 152 ran
 In the second season, the Australian middle order added runs at a speed of over 5 runs per over, while the tailanders added runs at a pace of over 4 runs per over in the last session
 aankade is baat kaa gavaah hai ki bhartiya gendbaazon ko apana homework or behatar karne kii zarurat he
 Experts such as former captain Sunil Gavaskar and former Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar seem to be upset that Indian bowlers are not trying to learn from mistakes
 purv captain sunil gavaskar kehete hai ki ye koi nai kahani nahin he
 D
 africa main bhi aisa hi hua or newzealand main bhi aisa hi hua
 It seems that Team India did not have any plan-b
 bhartiya team ranneeti ko lekar pichhadati dikhi
 However, bowler Umesh Yadav says that the bowlers are trying
 vah maanate hai ki newzealand yaa da
 Even in Africa, bowlers failed to bowl out the tail batsmen, but he says that does not mean he is not trying
 kai baar ballebaaz behatar khel dikhaa rahe hai to kai baar kismat kii vajah se vah kaamyaab nahin ho paa rahe
 The Test on the second day, which looked in favor of India, the failure of Indian bowlers on the third day forced it to be in Australia's favor

 desh kii charchit or ab tak kii sabase tej chalane vaali train 18 ko chif kamishnar of railway sefti (sisiares) ne aakhirkaar commercial ran ke liye apni manjuuri de di he
 The CCRS has given the necessary safety clearance for running train 18
 isse pehle electrical inspector bharat sarkaar (iaiji) ne is train ko sirf 3 maheene kii proviginal manjuuri di thi jisamen tamaam sharten bhi laga di gai thi lekin sisiares ne ab tii-18 train ko regular chalaane ke liye manjuuri de di he
 Railway Minister Piyush Goyal had to come forward to end the growing quarrel
 sisiares kii manjuuri milane ke baad ab train 18 ko kisi bhi din dilli se varanasi ke bich main chalaaya ja saktaa he
 The CCRS approval has allowed this train to run at a speed of 160 km per hour on the appropriate rail route for the capital, while on any other rail route, it has been approved to run at a speed of 105 km per hour
 deree ke peeche 2 vibhaag kii ladaayeehaalanki isse pehle tii-18 kii sefti clayerence ko lekar hui deree ke peeche railway ke do vibhaag maikenical or electrical ke bich chalaa vivaad he
 The railway's electrical department considers it legal to give its approval to this train designed in ICF Chennai, but the people of the mechanical department say that such approval is not a statutory obligation
 pichley saal 19 or 20 disambar ko sisiares inspection ke baad jab is vivaad ne tool pakadaa to electrical inspector bharat sarkaar se iaiji clearence maanga gaya
 On January 23, the EIG gave its consent, that too in a provisional manner for 3 months with all the conditions
 manjuuri ko tamaam shartelub ham aapako bataate hai electrical department ne kis tarah se is proviginal manjuuri ko tamaam sharton ke saath joda or tii-18 ko electrical inspector government of india ne kuch sharton ke saath sirf 3 maheene ke liye commercial ran ke liye manjuuri di thi
 In the letter dated 23 January for the approval of the EIG, it was said that the operation and maintenance of this train has been provisionally approved
 yah manjuuri indian electricity act 2003 or sefti se sambandhit central electricity athurity sanshodhan regulations 2010 / 2018 ke tahat di gai he
 The electrical inspector imposed conditions for this approval
 electrical inspector government of india (iaiji) ne kaha tha ki train 18 main hai voltage ke liye achti termination or lo voltage ke liye alti control power cabaling ko uchit tareeke se alag-alag rakhaa janaa chahie
 For this, the cubicle of the hightening wire should be made completely separate, it was also said that the vacuum circuit breaker (VCB) and other switches should be kept separately in terms of safety by not putting them together at high voltage and low voltage
 should go
 aies maanakon ke saath kaam kaa sujhavelectrical inspector report main duusari baat
 The report stated that proper color coding of electrical cable should be done as well as earthing under IS standards
 is train kii chat par lagi 25 kevi hitansion cabel maikenical tareeke se uchit dhang se protect karne kii salaah di gai thi
 It was also said that this cable should be properly supported while going from one coach to another
 report main kaha gaya tha ki pantograph se pantograph ke bich feeding cabel electrickli anprotected he lihaaja isko electric phalt hone kii sthiti main ek uchit protection skim banaai jaani chahie jisase trection kaa sab stesan trip naa karen
 The Electrical Inspector in his report had said that prototype testing of all the main equipment of Train-18 should be done within 3 months
 in sabhi sting ke liye time line ko haftebhar ke andar tay kar liya janaa chahie
 Simultaneously, it was also said that in case of failure of OHE in the fire safety plan and the train, necessary plans have to be given to get people out of the train
 electrical inspector ne yah bhi kaha ki dijal loko shed shakurabsti main 25 kevi trection upkarnon ko mentin karne ke liye jaruri infrastracchar nahin he
 Therefore, this train should be maintained for maintenance in EMU and MEMU trains maintenance
 iaiji ne ginai khamiyaiaiji ke proviginal parmishan letters main is baat par chintaa bhi jaahir kii gai ki train ke electrical sab system ke dizin or testing main gambhir khamiyaan hai
 Therefore this train should be placed under the supervision of an experienced supervisor and it should be staffed who have been trained to operate 25 kv AC traction and related systems
 commercial ran se pehle train ko chalaane vaale aise staff kii kwalification or anubhav ko is offis main dena hoga
 Staff running train 18 will have to send the details of observations to EIG after every trip for the next 3 months
 unki ore se yah bhi kaha gaya ki maujuuda anumati proviginal he or sirf 3 maheene ke liye he
 It was also directed that within 7 days all the documents and the certificate of consent certificate should be submitted to them so that the passenger's safety is sufficient or not
 apni had paar kar rahe electrical inspectoriiji ke letters ke jawaab main isief ke principal chif maikenical ejeeniyar ne nordarn railway ke principal chif maikenical ejeeniyar ko patr likhakar kaha ki iaiji inspection ke daayre main bahut si chijen nahin aati hai
 But it was said that within a month all the information sought would be given to them
 is patr main yah bhi hawala diya gaya ki 16 may 2016 ke gajet notification ke mutabik 11 kevi tak ke upkaran or instolation ko self certification ke jariye hi manjuuri mil jaati he or yah self certification pehle hi railway board ko diya ja chukaa he
 The letter said that more than 11kv of equipment should have been inspected at the EIG inspection of Northern Railway
 patr main saaf-saaf likhaa gaya he ki electrical inspector kaa nirikshan sirf pantograph se primary vinding tak hi simit he
 Apart from this, everything is self-certified which is legal
 agar isse zyada koi bhi cheez electrical inspector apane nirikshan ke daayre main laata he to yah apni had paar kar rahaa he or isko inspector raaj ke baraabar mana ja saktaa he
 Railway Minister created pressure This letter from the ICF clearly shows how the two departments of Railways are challenging each other's jurisdiction between electrical and mechanical
 baharhaal ham aapako bataa den ki yah donon department jab aamane saamne aa gaye to ek baar phir se lagane laga ki train 18 kii manjuuri ek baar phir se khatai main padane ja rahi he
 In the midst of the dispute, pressure was made by the Railway Minister to bring the railway officials to the curb and after that the middle ground could be found out
 iaiji ke taur par namit kiye gaye uttar railway ke principal chif electrical ejeeniyar or principal chif maikenical ejeeniyar ko ek saath baitaakar ek manjuuri patr par hastakshar karaae gaye
 It was written in the letter that all technical issues will be looked into
 jahaan tak sambhav hoga or isi ke saath aane vaale dinon main train 18 kii agali rex main in ko sammilit kiya jayega
 When this letter was given to the Chief Commissioner of Railway Safety, then a certificate of safety was issued for the regular commercial run of Train 18

 Rice i
e
 Akshat has been considered the most sacred grain in our texts
 agar puja paath main kisi saamagree kii kami rah jaae to us saamagree kaa samaran karte hue chaaval chadaaye ja sakate hai
 It is prohibited to offer some material to some god or other like Tulsi does not climb kunku and Shiva does not offer turmeric
 ganesh to tulsi nahin chadhati to durga ko durva nahin chadhati lekin chaaval har bhagwaan ko chadhate hai
 While offering rice to God, it should be kept in mind that the rice should not be broken
 akshat purnataa kaa pratik he at: sabhi chaaval akhandit hone chahie
 By offering only 4 grains of rice daily, one gets immense opulence
 chaaval saaf evam svachh hone chahie
 Shivji is overjoyed by offering unbroken rice on Shivling and offers unbroken wealth, honor and honor like unbroken rice
 yaad rakhen khandit chaaval kabhi bhi shiv sweekaar nahin karte
 You can see any of your adorable by offering four rice grains for one month
 
 
 ghar main annapurna mata kii pratimaa ko chaaval kii dheri par par sthapit karnaa chahie
 There is no shortage of money and wealth throughout life
 pujan ke samay akshat is mantra ke saath bhagwaan ko samarpit kiye jate hai :akshatashch surashreshth kunkmakta: sushobhita:
 Maya Nivedita Bhaktya: Grihaan parmeshwar
this mantra means, o God, i am dedicating this grace to you, adorned with the color of Kunkum in worship, please accept it
 ann main akshat yani chaaval ko shreshth mana jaataa he
 It is also called Devanna
 devataaon kaa priy ann he chaaval
 Offering it to you with perfumed liquor kunkum
 ise grahan kar aap bhakt kii bhaavana ko sweekaar karen
 The intention of offering the Akshata in worship is that our worship is complete like Akshat
 ann main shreshth hone ke kaaran bhagwaan ko chadhaate samay yah bhav rahata he ki jo kuch bhi ann hamen praapt hota he vah bhagwaan kii krupa se hi miltaa he
 Therefore, this feeling should also remain in us
 iskaa safed rang shanti kaa pratik he
 Therefore, the completeness of each of our tasks should be such that its fruits give us peace
 isiilie pujan main akshat ek anivaary saamagree he

 bharat or pakistan ke bich varsh 1999 main hue kargil yuddh ke baad ek behad sangeen maamla saamne aane se deshavaasiyon kii bhavanaaen buree tarah aahat huin
 Such things came to light that there was a huge scandal in the coffins that were procured to bring home the dead bodies of the soldiers who were martyred in the war in a respectful manner
 bazaar-bhav se zyada dar par kharidisi maamle main desh kii kendriya jaanch agency sibiai ne kuch varisht sainya adhikariyon or america ke ek thekedaar ke kilaaf maamla darj kiya
 The fact is that the Ministry of Defense of India had bought aluminum coffins and corpses from a US company

 In this deal, US $ 2500 per coffin i
e
 about one lakh twenty thousand rupees and US $ 85 per bag for body bags was paid
 baad main paaya gaya ki yah dar antarrashtriya bazaar-bhav ke anusaar bahut hi zyada thi
 The deal was worth about 1
5 million rupees and 5 thousand US Dollars i
e
 about 7 crores rupees, combined with the weight of the coffins
 jaanch main paaya gaya he ki jis amareeki company ke saath sauda hua tha, vah in tabuton kii nirmaataa company nahin thi
 The 150 coffins that the company had previously supplied, weighed 55 kg per coffin, while the deal should have weighed 18 kg
 dallalon kii jeb main gai janata kii rakamshuruaati jaanch main yah bhi paaya gaya ki tabuton ke saath welding ke jariye chhedchhad kii gai thi, jiske kaaran usamen suraakh hone kaa khatara bad gaya tha
 That is why the controversial coffin was not found worthy of use
 is tarah sarkaar ko kareeb ek lakh 87 hajaar amareeki dollar yani lagbhag 89 lakh 76 hazaar rupye kaa bhari ghaataa hua
 The money of the hard earned money of the public did not work for the bodies of the martyrs and went to the pockets of touts and corrupt officers

 The Congress has started trying to implement the exercise to make the last lamp of hope a moon
 pehle sarkaar kaa shakl badali, ab sanghathan kaa cheharaa badalegaa
 a big role has been fixed for Rahul Gandhi in the organizational reshuffle
 bas aupchaarik elaan hona baaki he
 Looking at Mission 2014, preparations have started to increase Rahul's stature, but whether he will prove to be full moon light fourteenth moon is the biggest question
 'youth congress ke liye kaam karnaa chaahate hai rahul'congress ko jis vakt kaa intjaar saalon se tha, wo ghadi bas aane vaali he
 So far, the preparations to make Rahul Gandhi's stature confined in the shell of minor roles in the Congress are about to be sealed
 faisle kii jhalak ravivaar ko tab dikhi jab manmohan singh sarkaar kii shakl badali, lekin cheharaa ubhar kar aayaa rahul gandhi kaa
 Rahul Gandhi's personality started to look strong in the call of change
 congress par rahul gandhi ke dabadabe ko lekar kisi ko kabhi koi shaq shubahaa nahin rahaa, lekin loksabhaa chunaavon se pehle aakhri bade pherbadal main jis tarah se rahul kii chali, usase saaf ho gaya ki 2014 ke chunavi mahabharat main congress sabase bade maharathi vahi honge
 The ministers of the Rahul Brigade, who are in the government, did not take any time to express the stature of this uncrowned king of the Congress
 kaaryakari adhyaksh yaa upaadhyaksh ban sakate hai rahulamanmohan sarkaar main pherbadal ke baad jis baat kii sabase zyada charchaa he wo he congress sanghathan ko majboot banane ke liye badlaav
 It is believed that Rahul, the national general secretary of the Congress, can be made the executive president or vice president of the party
 charchaa ye bhi he ki rahul ko congress kaa secetry general pad bana kar unke kad or dabadabe ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Rahul gives preference to the party in lieu of the government Whenever it comes to the Congress's Mission 2014, it is often hot to discuss the Congress leading Rahul to the electoral contest
 manmohan singh bhale hi aath saal se pradhanmantri hon, lekin congress ke zyaadaatar netaa rahul ko party kaa bhavishya maanate hai
 In such a situation, if Rahul is officially placed on the number two chair in the Congress, then not only will the party dominate but the stature will also be in full swing
 pichley 5 saalon se sanghathan ke liye kaam kar rahe hai rahulrahul gandhi main siyaasi sambhaavna he
 Mission 2014 is the skill to realize dreams
 pichley paanch saalon se rahul sanghathan ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 Prefer youth netaaon main unke karibiyon kii list alag he, lekin ye sari khubiyaan milakar bhi ek sawaal kaa jawaab nahin ban paatin ki kya rahul kaa sikaa matadaataaon par chalegaa
 By changing the shape of the government, Rahul Gandhi gave this message that he started preparations for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from now
 sabase mushkil imtihaan se pehle congress ne apana sabase bada daanv khel diya, lekin sawaal yahi he ki kya rahul gandhi is mushkil imtihaan main kaamyaab ho paaenge? siyasat ke jaankaron kii maane to sanghathan ko majboot karne kaa kavayad tabhi kargar hogi, jab iske liye lagaataar koshish kii jaae
 Rahul wanted to bring Gandhi into the cabinet: Before this, Prime Minister Rahul has played a failed bet to make the Congress strong in the Hindi belt
 bihar or uttar pradesh kii naakaami ne unke karishmein par sawalia nishaan laga diya
 According to experts, the failure to easily connect with the common people was heavy for them
 jaankaar kuch bhi kahe, lekin siyaasi halako main congress ne rahul kii team taiyaar karne kaa sandesh zarur de diya he
 Obviously, when the young faces get a chance to work in the government and the organization, then the party will also get a chance to improve its image

 sitaraman or vitt mantralay ke anya adhikariyon ne udyog jagat ke pratinidhiyon ke saath sust hoti arthvyavastha or growth main kami par vistaar se baat kii
 Sajjan Jindal, chairman of JSW Group, said that it has been decided that the government will take some action soon to revive the industry
 hamen vitt mantralay se sakaaratmak sanket mili hai
 He said that the Finance Minister has given a clear assurance that a solution will be found
 unhone kaha ki khaskar steel, gaiyr banking vittiya company (enbiensi) or automobile sector kai tarah kii samasyaon se jujh rahaa he
 Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Enterprises, said that many issues were raised by the finance minister before the banks hesitated to give loans to the industry
 unhone is mulaakaat ke baad patrakaron ko bataaya ki aisa nahin he ki bainkon main nakadi kii tangi ho, lekin karj dene kii gati nahin bad rahi he
 As far as the NBFC sector is concerned, there is pressure on the economy
 mujhe yah bataaya gaya ki jaldi hi karrwai hogi
 So, we will wait for it
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar se yah bhi aashwaasan mila he ki siesaar kharch ke niyam ko paalan na karne waalon ko dandatmak sajaa dene kaa companyj lau ke tahat niyam aage nahin badhaayaa jayega

 Santosh Hegde, Karnataka Lokayukta and member of the Lokpal Drafting Committee, said on Thursday that the meetings of the committee on June 20 and 21 would be a mere formality as there was no scope for discussion with the government
 hegade ne kaha, agali do baithken mahaj vidheyak ke do masaudon kaa aadan-pradaan karne kii aupchaarikta bhar hogi
 So, i think the main part of the discussion is over
 har kisi ko mahasoos ho rahaa he ki faisla kar liya gaya he or ab adhik charchaa nahin ho sakati
 At least the members of society feel the same
 unhone kaha ki anna hazaare ke liye nirnay karne kii prakriya main ab koi bhoomika nahin bachi he
 The Lokayukta of Karnataka insisted that the fight against corruption should continue
 unhone kaha ki na sirf centre main sattarudh dal, balki desh main shashan karne vaali lagbhag har party ne vyaavhaarik taur par prabhaavshaalee lokapal ke liye gambhir koshishen nahin kii hai
 Accusing the governments since independence of not being serious about the issue, Hegde said that the Lokpal bill has been prepared eight times so far but the law has not been made
 unhone kaha ki yah apane aap main is baat kaa sanket he ki koi bhi sarkaar ek majboot bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon banane yaa bhrashtachar se nipatane ke liye koi sakht santhaan banane kaa iraadaa nahin rakhti
 On the petition of AAP MLA Sanjeev Jha, the High Court has issued a notice to the Central Government and LG
 sanjeev jha ne yachika lagaai he ki pulicekarmiyon kii shikaayat ke liye banaai gai pisie (police complaints authority) main local vidhayak kii bhoomika ko khatm kar diya gaya he
 Sanjeev Jha has petitioned for changes in the PCA so that elected representatives of the public are also given place in complaints against the police
 sanjeev jha kii taraf se lagaai gai yachika main kaha gaya he pisie ko banane ke dauraan bhi dilli sarkaar ke chune gaye janpratinidhiyon se koi raay nahin lee gai
 LG has formed PCA shortly before
 alji ke notification ke baad banaai gai pisie ke niyamon ke mutabik police se peedit koi bhi vyakti is athurity main apni shikaayat darj kara saktaa he
 Apart from the victim, NHRC LG Chief Secretary or Principal Secretary can also transfer complaints against the police to PCA
 alji ke aadesh par banaai gai pisie kaa dilli main ek chairman niyukt kiya jayega, jo hoicourt se ritred jaj honge
 There will be a total of 3 members in the PAC in which it is mandatory to have a woman
 pisie ko banane kaa mukhya makasad unshikayaton par karrwaikarna he jo peedita dwaara pulicekarmiyon ke khilaaf darj karwaai gai he
 It is often seen that there is no action on the complaints of the police in the police department, that is why this independent committee has been formed
 hoicourt main aam aadmi party ke vidhayak sanjeev jha kii taraf se lagaai gai yachika main kaha gaya he ki jis ilaake main bhi police ke khilaaf shikaayatein ho vahaan kaa MLA bhi cameti ko sidhe apni shikaayat de sake, yah adhikaar janpratinidhi ko milanaa chahie
 On October 10, the Delhi High Court will hear the matter again and before that the Center and LG will have to file their reply in the matter on the notice of the Delhi High Court

 har saal kii tarah is baar bhi baishakh maah ke shukla paksh kii chaturdashi ko duniyabar main narsingh chaturdashi kaa mahotsav manaaya ja rahaa he
 Although very few people know about this Mahaparva, but this date has been described as very important in the scriptures
 shastron main varnan aata he ki isi tithi ko bhagwan narsingh kaa prakatya hua tha
 In the seventh skanda of Srimad Bhagavatam, there is a description of the incarnation of Bhagwan Narasimha
 hiranyakashiphu naamak atyant krur rakshas ne brahma ji kii 36 hazaar varshon tak tapasya karke unhen vardaan dene par baadhya kar diya tha
 Happy with his harsh penance, Brahma also gave Hiranyakashipu a boon very close to immortality
 usne brahma ji se na jal, na thal, na din, na raat main, na kisi astr se, na shastr se, na ghar ke bahaar na andar, na zamin par na akaash main, na hi brahma ke dwaara banaaye gaye kisi bhi jeev ke dwaara na marane kaa vardaan le liya tha
 By demanding such a boon, he became convinced that he has now become immortal
 lekin vah bhul gaya ki koi kitna bhi hoshiyaar ho, bhagwan kii hoshiyaari usase kai guna hoti he
 Prahlad, the son of Hiranyakashipu, was an ardent devotee of Lord Vishnu
 vah sadaiv bhagwan kaa gungan, unki charchaa va unka prachaar karata tha
 Not only the others, but he also used to fearlessly inspire his parents for devotion to God
 hiranyakashiphu jo apane dhan, aishwarya or shakti se itnaa andhaa ho chukaa tha ki apane chote se putr kii baaten bhi kaaphi kadavi lagati thim
 This was the reason that he had made up his mind to kill his own son
 shastron ke anusaar bhagwan apane param bhakt prahlaad kii raksha karne ke liye khambe se narsingh avatar, jo ki aadhe nar tathaa aadhe singh the, us rup main prakat hue the or hiranyakashiphu kaa vadh kiya
 There are many reasons behind Bhagwavan taking this wonderful form
 rosh ko prakat karne ke liye sher janaa jaataa he
 In the same way, Bhagavan was in extreme rage after seeing Pratirana towards Prahlad of Hiranyakashipu
 ise prakat karne ke liye unhone singh kaa rup dhaaran kiya
 After the slaughter, when all the gods and goddesses were frightened, Prahlad stepped forward and pacified them and Bhagavan showed his affection by licking Prahlada with his lion face
 tippaniyan The devotee of Narasimha Chaturdashi shows his commitment to the Vatsalya religion and his Bhagavadatta
 dilli ke punjabi baag sthitiscon mandir ke adhyaksh rukmani krishna das ne bataaya kii is mahotsav main bhaktajan shaam tak upwas rakh kar, shaam ke samay main narsingh bhagwan kaa abhishek kar ke narsingh lila kii charchaa kar ke prasad grahan karke bhagwan ke prem kaa aswadan kar saktaa he
 Lord Narasimha is also called the disruptor destroyer, who eliminates all the obstacles that come in our devotional life, so the devotees pray for him to end the demon like Hiranyakashipu in his heart
 haalanki bhagwaan kaa yah rup bhayanak prathit hota he lekin bhakton ke liye ye atyant sundar or prem pradarshit karne vaala he
 There is a description in the scriptures that on the same date, Lord Narasimha appeared
 shrimad bhagwatam ke saatven skanda main bhi bhagwan narsingh ke avataran kaa varnan aata he
 An extremely cruel demon named Hiranyakashipu had done penance for 36 thousand years and forced him to boon
 uski kathor tapasya se khush brahma ji ne hiranyakashiphu ko amartv ke bilkul nazadik vardaan bhi diya
 He did not water, nor land, day nor night, nor any weapon, nor weapon, outside the house nor in the sky, nor any creature created by Brahma, from Brahma ji
 Had taken the boon of not dying
 aisa vardaan maang kar wo aashwast ho gaya ki vah ab amar ho gaya he
 But he forgot that no matter how clever a person is, the intelligence of God is manifold
 hiranyakashiphu kaa putr prahlaad bhagwan vishnu kaa param bhakt tha
 He always praised, discussed and preached God
 na keval dusron ko, balki vah nirbhay hokar apane mata-pita ko bhi bhagwan kii bhakthi ke liye prerit karata tha
 Hiranyakashipu who was so blinded by his wealth, opulence and power that even the words of his younger son seemed very bitter
 yahi vajah thi kii usne apane hi putr ko maarane kaa man bana liya tha
 According to the scriptures, to protect his supreme devotee Prahlad, Narasimha Avatar from the pillar, who was half male and half lion, appeared in that form and killed Hiranyakashipu
 bhagavvaan ko ye adbhut rup dhaaran karne ke peeche bhi kai kaaran hai
 The lion is known to reveal fury
 vaise hi hiranyakashiphu ke prahlaad kii taraf pratarna ko dekh ke bhagwan atyadhik rosh main the
 He took the form of a lion to reveal it
 vadh ke baad jab sabhi devi-devtaa bhaybheet the, tab prahlaad ne aage bad ke unako shant kiya or bhagwan ne apane singh mukh se prahlaad ko chaat kar ke apana sneh dikhaaya
 The comments narsingh chaturdashi bhagwan kii bhakt vatsalya dharm ke prati katibaddhta evam unki bhagavadta ko pradarshit karata he
 Rukmani Krishna Das, President of ISKCON Temple, Punjabi Bagh, Delhi, told that in this festival, devotees keep the fast till evening, anoint Narasimha Bhagavan in the evening and recite the Narasimha Leela and receive the offerings and offer their blessings to the Lord
 Can
 bhagwaan narsingh ko vighn vinaashak bhi kaha jaataa he, jo hamaare bhakthimay jivan main aane vaali sabhi baadhaon ko samaapt karte hai, isliye bhakt un se apane hriday main vidyaman hiranyakashiphu jaise asur ko samaapt karne kii prarthana karte hai

 Referring to the characters of Mahabharata, he said that he is being attacked like Draupadi and he (nitish) is silently watching like Bhishma Pitamah

 maanjhi ne kaha ki is tarah kii baithak bulaane kaa adhikaar sirf mukhyamantri ko he
 At the same time, many mlas have also supported Manjhi's point

 Jivati's mother Ameri Kashi Kohli is confident that her daughter is taken to recover the 'never ending' debt, not for marriage

 By the way, it is quite common in South Pakistan to hear many such stories
 
 
 chote-chote karz bilkul naammumkin rakamon main tabdeel ho jate hai, or chukaai gai rakam kabhi ghatati hi nahin
 
 
 In this world, women like Ameri and her daughter are considered property, sometimes taken as loan payments, sometimes for settling fights
 
 
 kabhi unhen badla lene ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, to kabhi zameendaar dwaara mazdoor ko di gai sazaa ke taur par
 
 
 Sometimes parents themselves offer to give their daughter away for the 'never ending' debt
 
 
 in ladakiyon ko hasil kar lenaa ye purush apni shaan samajhate hai
 
 
 They choose the most beautiful-looking, youngest, and most submissive girls
 
 
 kabhi-kabhaar ve unhen duusari patni ke rup main rakh lete hai, taaki ve unke gharon kii dekhbhaal kar saken
 
 
 Sometimes they push those girls into prostitution, so that they can earn money and give it to them
 
 
 kabhi-kabhi ve sirf isliye inhen uthaa le jate hai, kyonki ve aisa karne main sakasham hai
 
 
 Hindu Ameri by religion says, "I went to the police as well as to the court
 
 
 koi bhi hamaari fariyaad nahin sunata
 
 
 "he says that the zamindar got his daughter converted to Muslim, and then kept her as a second wife
 
 
 ameri ne kaha, "unhone hamase kaha, 'tumhaari beti ne islam kabool kar liya he, or ab tum use waapas nahin paa sakate

 After this, the family requested the help of activist Vireo Kohli, so that the girl could be freed
 
 
 vero kaa ameri ke parivaar se koi rishta nahin he, or vah khud bhi gulam ke rup main paidaa hui thim
 
 
 After being freed from bonded labor in 1999, she devoted her life to challenging powerful landlords, and she has got thousands of families out of bonded labor
 
 
 sadiyon se purush-pradhan samskruti ke hawaale rahe mulk main vero kaa is tarah unke khilaaf khadey hona purushon ko phooti aankh nahin bhaataa
 
 
 Vireo says, "I know, they want to kill me
" 
 
 lekin main in logon ko azaad karwaane ke liye ladanaa band nahin karuungi
 
 
 " paanch maheene pehle ameri ko saath lekar vero piyaaro lundh police stesan gai, taaki jivati ko dhundha ja sake
 
 
 Policemen said that Jeevati had gone on her own
 
 
 vero ne bataaya, "maine unase kaha, 'agar vah apni marzi se gai he, to mujhe usase baat karne do, uski maa ko usase baat karne do', lekin unhone inkaar kar diya
 
 
 " iske baad jivati se sampark karwaane ke sthaan par police waalon ne us shaks hamid brohi ko bulawaaya, jo ameri ke mutabik uski beti ko le gaya
 
 
 After this Vero says, Hamid Brohi came alone, not with Jeevati, and came and said, "that (jeevati) is the payment of one lakh rupees (US $ 1,000), which you had to pay me
 
 
 " After this, Vireo repeatedly reached the same police station, where police officer Akeel Ahmad, on seeing him, very rarely hid his anger in a pile of files, and finally one day he took out an affidavit from the same pile, and showed Viro
 
 
 
 affidavit main likhaa tha, jivati, jise dharmaparivartan ke baad fatima naam se janaa jaataa he, ne apni marzi se islam kabool kiya tha, apni marzi se hamid se shaadi kii thi

 Haider explained, "they always sort pretty girls
 
 
 " The night the Jivati disappeared, the whole family was sleeping outside the house, as this is the only way to escape the heat in southern Sindh province

 Vireo has no relationship with Amery's family, and she herself was born as a slave
 
 
 varsh 1999 main bandhua mazaduri se azaad ho jane ke baad unhone apana jivan taqatvar zameendaaron ko chunauti dene ke liye samarpit kar diya, or vah hazaron pariwaron ko bandhua mazaduri se nijaat dilava chuki hai
 
 
 In a country that has been citing male-dominated culture for centuries, it is not easy for men to stand against them in this way
 
 
 vero kaa kahana he, "main jaanati hum, ve mujhe maar daalana chaahate hai
 
 
 But i will not stop fighting to get these people free
 
 
 " Five months ago Vireo Piero accompanied Ameri went to the police station to find Jivati
 
 
 police waalon ne kaha ki jivati apni marzi se gai he
 
 
 Vireo reported, "I told her, 'if she has gone on her own, let me talk to her, let her mother talk to her'," but she refuses
 
 
 " After this, instead of contacting Jeevati, the policemen called the man Hamid Brohi, who according to Ameri took his daughter
 
 
 vero bataati hai, iske baad hamid brohi akelaa aayaa, jivati ko lekar nahin, or aakar bolaa, "vah (jivati) bhugtan he un ek lakh rupayon (1,000 america dollar) kaa, jo tumne mujhe chukaane the
 
 
 " iske baad vero baar-baar usee police stesan pahunch jaati thi, jahaan police adhikari akil ahamed use dekhakar bahut mushkil se apane gusse ko filon ke dher main chhipate the, or aakhir ek din unhone usee dher main se ek affidavit nikaala, or vero ko dikhaaya
 
 
 In the affidavit, Jeevati, popularly known as Fatima after conversion, had converted to Islam at her own will, marrying Hamid at her own will
 
 
 usamen yah bhi likhaa tha ki vah apni maa se isliye nahin mil sakati, kyonki vah ab musalmaan he, or uskaa mul parivaar hindu tha
 
 
 Hindu activists say that these girls are kept in hiding after being picked up until they are forcibly converted and married
 
 
 or aisa ho chukne ke baad kuch bhi karnaa mumkin nahin rah jaataa
 
 
 But ultimately under pressure, the police had to take Vireo and a foreign journalist to Jeevati in a jeep loaded with machine guns
 
 
 jivati kii maa police kaa phir saamana karne se dar rahi thi, so, vah nahin gai
 
 
 Hamid Brohi, who looked like an irritable and fine-looking mustache, got a welcome from the police
 
 
 police stesan main kiye gaye daawey ke ain ulat vahaan apane ghar par usne gusse main bharkar is baat se inkaar kiya ki usne jivati ko karze ke bhugtan ke taur par uthaaya tha
 
 
 Inside, Jiviti was found sitting on a mattress lying on the ground
 
 
 uske sir par kaale rang kaa shawl lipta hua tha
 
 
 There was heavy makeup on the eyes, a thick layer of scarlet lipstick was seen on the lips as well
 
 
 bilkul usee tarah, jaise kisi bacchee ne maa kii mechap kit istemaal kii ho, yaa koi ladki jaanboojhkar apni umr zyaada dikhaane kii koshish kar rahi ho
 
 
 Though she did not look scared at all, her eyes were fixed on the same door, where her husband continued to hover
 
 
 jab vah boli, to saaf laga, jaise kai-kai baar bolne kaa riyaaz karavaaya gaya he
 
 
 Jeevati said, "I married him, because i wanted to do that
 
 
 maine khud unase yah baat kahi thi ki ham donon ek-duusare se pyaar karte hai, to hamen shaadi kar leni chahie
 
 
 Then he said, 'come on, let's get married
 
 
 ' or maine kaha, 'haa
 
 
 '" jivati ne is baat se inkaar kiya ki usne apni maa ko ghar chhodane ke baad se nahin dekha he, lekin vah yah nahin bataa pai ki usne aakhri baar apni maa ko kahaan dekha tha - yaa vah ab rahati kahaan he, kyonki purana ghar ve chhodkar ja chuke hai
 
 
 She remained silent even when she was asked why she refused to visit her mother because of her confession to Islam, according to an affidavit in court
 
 
 jivati ne kaha ki use nahin pataa ki court ke dastauez main kya likhaa he, haalanki police ne har dastauez dikhaate hue yahi daawa kiya tha ki ye sabhi baaten jivati ne khud kahi thim
 
 
 The comments agle din vahaan pahunche donon log - vero or videshi patrkaar - laut jate hai, bina police kii gaadi ke
 
 
 
 
 
 or us vakt us dalan ke bheetar sirf auraten hi auraten thim, jinamein se koi bhi fatima ko nahin jaanati
 
 
 The room in which Jivati was sitting the previous day was locked
 
 
 aisa lag rahaa tha ki is ghar ko jivati se yah sab kahalwane ke liye hi stage ke taur par taiyaar kiya gaya tha
 
 
 According to a report by the South Asia Partnership Organization, every year in Pakistan, about 1,000 Hindu and Christian girls, most of whom are minors, are expelled from their homes, converted to Muslims, and married
