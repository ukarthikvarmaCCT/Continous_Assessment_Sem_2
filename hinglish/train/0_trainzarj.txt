 centre main sattadhari gathbandhan kii duusari sabase badi party, mamata banerjee kii trinmul congress ne lokapal vidheyak kaa virodh kar sarkaar ko sharmasaar kiya tha

his vision of empowering gramin samudaayon, visheshkar mahilaon ko shashakt banane kaa unka vijan amul pariyojna main dikhataa he
 It was Sardar Patel who popularized the idea of cooperative housing society and thus ensured respect and shelter for many people
 sardaar par sabhi ko tha bharosapiem modi ne likhaa ki sardaar patel ke raajnneetik mitra bhi un par bharosa karte the
 Acharya Kripalani used to say that whenever he was in a dilemma and if Bapu's guidance could not be found, he used to turn to Sardar Patel
 saal 1947 main jab raajnneetik samjhaute ke bare main vichaar-vimarsh apane charam par tha, tab sarojini naidu ne unhen ‘sankalp shakti vaale gatisheel vyakti’ kii sangya di thi
 Everyone had full faith in his words and his way of working

 The war from history to the present is the easiest

 This thrilling battle is hollow
 harata-jeetta koi nahin alabatta itihaas bodh kii shahadat kaa nayaa itihaas ban jaataa he
 Erik Hobsbawm is said to be the historian of twentieth century historians
 ve kehete the, ''pehle main samajhataa tha ki itihaas nabhikeey bhautikee jaisaa khatarnaak nahin he lekin ab mujhe lagata he ki itihaas bhi utana hi bhayanak ho saktaa he
 "the killing of history in association with politics started in the twentieth century itself
" lambey khun-khachchar ke baad europe ne yah vaastaviktaa sweekaar kar lee ki itihaas ke sach hameshaa kuch moolyaheen tathyon or arthpurna nirnyon ke bich paae jate hai
 The facts of history alone have no meaning
 inaki nirpeksh yaa vastuparak vyakhya nahin ho sakati
 It can be understood only in contexts, so there is always a danger of their political use
 jin samaajon main saanskrithik itihaas rashtriya itihaas se purana or samrudh ho, itihaas va myth ke rishte gadhe hon or paraspar virdohi tathy itihaas kaa hissaa hon, vahaan itihaas par raajnneeti khatarnaak ho jaati he
 Whether to stop the threats of throats on films, books in India or not
 lekin ikkisvin sadi main itihaas ko dekhne ke nae tareekon par charchaa main koi harj nahin he
 Cultural memories 40 meters high steel statue of Genghis Khan near Ullanbatore has been installed in the last decade itself
 mongolia kii jaateey smritiyon main changez khan kii jo chhavi he, europe va arab mulk use kabhi sweekaar nahin karenge
 Ethnic memories are an indispensable part of any history, but for any other society they have exactly the opposite meaning
 bharat main kai raja or samraat kahin nayak to kahin khalanaayak hai
 Such history is far from the present and is not even relevant for the future, however politics can make it explosive
 bhuulane ke upakramaitihaas kabhi nahin marataa lekin samaj-boojhkar use bhulane kii koshishen bhi ateet se samvaad ke nae tareekon kaa hissaa hai
 Europe is ashamed of medieval barbarism
 china va britain ke rishton par opium yuddh chaaya nahin he
 Britain wants to forget colonial history
 america, japan par parmaanu hamale ko yaad karne se bachataa he
 Spain invades Latin America, Stalin's barbarities or Hitler's brutality! Which was the biggest massacre in the world? Research on this will go on, but after the world wars, efforts are on to save parts of history in collective oblivion so that the present can live with peace
 keemtee yaadagarasmriti va itihaas main ek bada antar he
 Memory is that part of the past of a society that is remembered or learned from, whereas history is the dimension of the past whose relevance is determined by its distance from the present
 taaja itihaas ko, bahut puraane itihaas par, variyata di jaati he kyonki taaja ateet, vartmaan ke kaam aa saktaa he
 The most political controversy is about the history that we want to remember again and again and learn from it in the present
 isliye smarak, sangrahalay banane, itihaas kii paathya pustakon kaa vishay tay karne or kala-kalpana main itihaas ke prasangon par gale katane lagate hai
 So how do we decide which history the present should choose? Wim van Merus, Professor of History of the Netherlands, is worth pondering
 In the 21st century, any community has two goals — first, to be an independent nation and second, to be that nation
 To be a democracy
 itihaas kii jo bhi vyakhya raashtra yaa jaateey pahchaan ko prakat karti he, use loktantr ke mulyon kii kasuti par bhi behatar hona hoga, nahin to itihaas hameshaa ladaata rahegaa
 British journalist and historian, e

 sarkaar se manjuuri nahin mil paa rahimanchanda ne kaha, ‘main or chetan chouhan kal mukhyamantri se mili or hamane unhen bataaya ki manoranjan kar bahut adhik lagaaya gaya he
 Kejriwal asked us to contact the concerned Commissioner Sanjay Kumar

 There was no discussion on the exemption but he said that he would issue a letter setting aside the tax amount

 We were asked to reach the commissioner's office at four o'clock
 jab ham vahaan pahunche to kumaar ne hamase kaha ki vah der shaam unase milen
 If the DDCA has failed to get the approval within the deadline, then the BCCI has kept Pune as an option for the final Test starting on December 3

 Death is such a thing that, on hearing its name, the air of good and good becomes bad
 lekin bagdadi ke siraphire aatankwaadiyon ke liye shaayad maut hansi khel kaa naam he
 Only then, in a terrorist cap in Iraq, when the fidayeen going to attack the enemy's base competed with 'first me first', the decision was taken by two closed fists
 do aisi mutthi, jinamein ek main maut kaid thi, to duusare main zindagi
 The place - Mosul, Iraq - at 12 noon is a pleasant atmosphere in a camp of ISIS terrorists
 20 se 25 saal ke noujvaan aatankwaadi aapas main baaten karte hai
 But these conversations are not a mere secret, but a dreadful game
 khel, maut kii boli lagane kii or phir isi baatcheet ke bich ek aatankwaadi apane donon haath peeche le jaakar apni mutthi main kuch chupa letaa he
 That means one of his fists is full, while the other is empty
 iske baad wo donon mutthiyaan aage karata he
 Asks the terrorists standing in front to touch a fist
 darasal is tarah ye aatankwaadi ek faisalaa lenaa chaahate hai
 Decision of defeat and victory
 is khel ke niyam bilkul saafe hai
 The person who touches a full fist will win
 jabaki khaali mutthi jiske hisse main khulegi, use haar manani hogi
 According to the rule, a terrorist goes ahead and touches a fist
 ittefaq se ye bhari hui mutthi he yani jeet uske haath lagati he
 Now on his victory, this terrorist starts chirping wildly
 vahaan maujuud baaki ke aatankwaadi aage bad kar use badhai dene lagate hai
 The expression of the face of the winning terrorist, his happiness and congratulations to all the people present here, is that this victory is not a trivial victory, but a big success, but what? How is this victory? And what is the truth of this game? This truth is creepy
 darasal khuli or band mutthi se kheli gai ek aisi baazi he, jiskaa anjaam dhamaake kii surat main saamne aata he
 In fact, these terrorists were preparing to carry out a suicide attack on some of the Iraqi military-held positions on the Ishara of their boss, the ISIS chief Abu Bakr al-baghdadi
 lekin dikkat thi
 The problem is that many terrorists present in the camp were ready for this task
 garaz ye ki in aatankwaadiyon ko ye lagata he ki jo bhi is tarah dushman ke kheme main khud ko bam baandh kar uda legaa use sidhe jananath hasil hogi
 It was with this intention only that these terrorists were competing that after all, who would go to the enemy's camp to fly himself as a human bomb first
 iske liye mutthi ke is khel kaa sahaara liya
 Children around the world often play such open and closed fist markets for victory and defeat in different sports
 lekin in khoonkhaar aatankwaadiyon kaa dimaag kis kadar karaab ho chukaa he ki wo marane-maarane ke liye bhi mutthi ke is khel ke sahare apni baari kaa faisalaa kar rahe hai
 As soon as the victory is felt in this game, this terrorist starts to jump, as if this stake is not of death but of happiness

 2014 disambar main ladki kii shaadi hui or uske kuch hi hafte baad use vahtsap par 'talaaq' kaa sandesh bhej diya gaya
 After so many months of torture, the girl finally raised the courage and filed a complaint in the court of the Women's Commission in Kottayam
 ladki ne apane pati ke ek harahungez bayaan ke bare main bhi bataaya 'mujhe abhi bhi yaad he jab maine usase talaak kii vajah poochi to usne kaha ki use seve pasand he lekin wo aam bhi khaanaa chahta he
 Comments peedit kii maa ne apni beti ko bachaane kii guhaar lagaate hui kaha ki ladki kai maheenon se thik se soi bhi nahin he

 parinaam ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to maheshtala vidhansabha kshetra ke upachunaav main koi ulatpher nahin hua or ummid ke mutabik rajya main sattarudh trinmul congress ne jeet hasil kar lee, lekin isaki sabase khaas baat yah rahi ki bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne yahaan par bhi sipiem or congress kii jodi ko pachhadte hue khud ko duusare sthaan par pahunchaa diya
 Talking about the results of Maheshtala, BJP performed here in an unexpected manner and got 41,993 votes to surprise everyone
 sipiem ke garh main bijepivahin ek samaymaheshtalako sipiem kaa garh kaha jaataa tha or use haraa paanaa vipakshi dalon ke liye aasaan kaam nahin tha
 Till 2011, this seat was occupied by CPM, which was defeated by Kasturi Das of Trinamool Congress
 kasturi 7 saal pehle yahaan se 2011 main 24,283 maton ke antar se jeet hasil karne main kaamyaab raheen
 After this, he retained the seat in the 2016 assembly elections
 lekin is saal farvari main kasturi das ke nidhan ke baad yahaan par hueupachunaavamein kasturi ke pati dulaal das ne 1,04,818 vot hasil kar 62,896 maton ke antar se jeet apane naam kar lee
 With this victory, the big thing was BJP coming in second place
 kshetra main 22 fisadi muslim voter hone ke baavjoodbijepine kshetra main apni maujuudagi darj karaane main kamyaabi hasil kii
 BJP received 3,689 votes in 2011 while in 2016 it got 14,909 votes
 lekin is baar usne shandaar pradarshan kar dikhaaya kyonki usne sipiem-congress ke gathjod ko peeche chhodte hue pichley saal kii tulana main paune teen guna zyada vot (41,993) hasil kar liya
 The cpm-congress pair also failed and the cplpm-congress pair also failed here and its candidate got 30,316 votes
 voting share ke lihaaj se dekhen to 2016 main bijepi ko 7
 The vote was 7 percent, while the Left got 42
 2 fisadi vot mili the
 To say this is just a matter of Maheshtala, but the recent results show that BJP is strengthening its position as the second party after Trinamool Congress in the state
 rajya main mamata banerjee kii aguwai vaali tiemasi kii badshahath ko chunauti dena philhal kisi ke liye sambhav nahin dikh rahaa
 However, it is also clear that the BJP is fast spreading its foot in the state
 2014 main aam chunaav ke baad rajya main bijepi kaa groph teji se upar kii ore hi gaya he
 In the last 4 years, the saffron party has performed wonderfully
 panchayat chunaav main shandaar pradarshnaisi mahinepanchayat chunaavamein bhi sipiem or congress ko peeche chhodte hue bijepi duusare number kii party banakar ubhari
 TMC captured 20,848 seats out of 31,802 in panchayat elections
 jabaki bijepi ne 5,650 se zyada siten apane naam karte hue khud ko ranaap ke rup main rakhaa
 Also, for the first time BJP managed to win all the districts of the state
 pichley saal sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main bhi vah duusare sthaan par rahi thi
 The bjp's performance in the by-elections in the state before the panchayat elections was also impressive
 pashchim bengal kii navpada vidhansabha or uluberia loksabhaa upachunaav main bijepi ne sipiem se zyada vot hasil kiye the
 Even though TMC got the victory, the interesting thing is that in both of these seats, BJP came in second place, leaving behind CPM and Congress
 mamata ke baad number 2mamata or sipiem kii maujuudagi vaale bengal kii siyasat main bijepi apni jaden jamaane ke liye purajor koshish main lagi hue he
 Since 2014 Lok Sabha elections, its graph has increased continuously in the state
 bhagava party shuru se hi rajya main mamata banerjee ko muslimparast ke taur par pesh karti rahi he
 The BJP is trying to cash in on Mamata's image of Muslim patronage in her favor in the upcoming election
 bijepi ne mamata sarkaar ke khilaaf lagaataar abhiyaan chalaa rakhaa he
 The party is seen struggling on the road
 itnaa hi nahin usne rajya main khud ko majboot karne ke liye tiemasi ke diggat netaa mukul raay ko bhi apane saath mila
 The party is also embracing Muslim votes in the state
 is silsile main bijepi ne muslim sammelan kaa aayojan tak kiya
 After 2014, the boom of the CPM and Congress in the state has been continuously falling
 donon loksabhaa, phir vidhansabha, nagar nikaay or upachunaav ke baad ab panchayat chunaav main kamjor sabit hue
 The graph of CPM, which has held state power for 3 decades, has been steadily falling and slipping to the third position
 2014 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main 17 fisadi voton ke saath bijepi yahaan se 2 seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 The CPM also got only two seats, but while CPM lost 13 seats compared to 2009, the BJP gained one seat
 iske alaava 2016 main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi kii 6 fisadi vot kii badhottaree hui or party ko 10 fisadi mat mili
 The BJP also managed to win 3 places, while its alliance got 6 seats
 isse pehle bijepi ne yahaan se khaataa tak nahin kholaa tha
 Now it has to be seen how far the party, led by Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, can take themselves in the general elections in 2019
 agle aam chunaav main zyada vakt to nahin bachaa he, lekin bhagava party kii koshish rahegi ki vah 2021 main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main damdaar pradarshan kar khud ko satta ke kareeb le jaae

 Opportunistic behavior and political manipulation may lead to immediate gains or rupture, but unlike television anchors, history will testify that when progressive politics needed to be strengthened, we chose another route
 ' Tejashwi's hidden attack on the CM of the state has passed on to the JDU and after this, Bihar unit president Vasistha Narayan Singh questioned the future of the grand alliance

 Justices GS Singhvi and AK Ganguly dismissed the petition filed by Singh in this regard as well as withdrawing his interim order dated 27 February in which he told the media about Amar Singh's conversation Was asked not to make tap content public
 peeth ne saath hi yah bhi kaha ki amar singh ne is maamle main adaalat se tathyon ko chupaaya he

 The Supreme Court on 27 February 2006 prohibited the publication and transmission of taped material, including Singh, on electronic channels and print media
 jab singh kii telephone baatcheeton ko tap kiya gaya tha us samay vah samaajawaadee party ke mahasachiv the
 He had earlier accused Congress and private telecom provider Reliance Infocam of being involved in this taping
 unhone baad main congress ke khilaaf lagaaye gaye aaropon ko waapas le liya tha
 Singh, in addition to the Telecom and Home Minister, had also included Delhi Government and Delhi Police in his petition
 unhone apni yachika main kaha tha ki unki telephone baatcheet supreme court ke dishanirdeshon tathaa bhartiya telegraph kanoonon evam niyamon kaa ulanghan karke tap kii gayi
 In the last hearing, the court said that we are not even removing the ban on this petition, there is nothing left in it as it was filed on the basis of forged documents
 nyaayalay ne isse pehle kaha tha ki singh kii niztaa kaa ulanghan hua he lekin unhen doorsanchaar pradaata company ke khilaaf maamla daayar karnaa chahie
 The bench said that the matter of interference in your right to privacy has been accepted
 aapako iskaa hal reliance ke khilaaf maamla daayar karke mil saktaa he jisane aapaki telephone baatcheet tap kii
 You also have another solution
 nyaayalay ne yah tippanee us samay kii jab singh ne yah kaha ki yadi tap telephone baatcheet kii saamagree ko prakashit prasaarit karne par lagaayi gai roak hataayi jaati he to unki niztaa kaa or bhi ulanghan hoga
 The bench said that Singh can make any other alternative appeal against telecom provider Reliance Infocam which allowed him to tap his telephone conversations in 2005 on the basis of a forged document

 After partition, our imagination was that citizens who live in a minority here and those who are a minority in the neighboring country will be able to live life with respect
 apane dharm kaa sammaan ke saath paalan kar paaenge, apane parivaar kaa sammaan se rakshan kar paaenge
 But if we look at it after decades, the harsh truth has come to the fore that minorities in Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan did not get a life of respect

 Amit Shahne said that in Pakistan and then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), about 20-20% of the minority population has been reduced
 aakhir kahaan gaye wo log, yaa to wo maar die gaye yaa dharm parivartan ho gaya yaa wo log sharnaarthi banakar apane dharm or sammaan ko bachaane ke liye bharat aa gaye
 Amit Shah said that those who are saying that we are doing vote bank politics, i want to tell all those fellows that we had put this intention before the country before the election, which has been supported by the people of the country
 
 is bill main ham teenon padosi deshon (pakistan, bangladesh or afghanistan) ke dharmik alpsankhyakon ko sangrakshan dekar unkonaagarikbanane kii prakriya kaa sanshodhan lekar aae hai
 We have also brought provisions to protect the rights of the states of the north-east

 There is no discussion or concern in this bill for those who are Muslims of this country

 Recently an institution of saints has declared him a fake saint
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki ek thane main radhe maa ke prati itani shraddha kahaan tak uchit he? Will the bjp-led NDA win once again in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections? To know the answer to these questions, Aaj Tak got the mood of the country and put it in front of the country through his annual survey 'mood of the Nation'
 NDA kii lokapriyata main 2 fisadi kii giravatsurvey ke mutabik agar aaj loksabhaa chunaav hote hai, to endie ko 40 fisadi, upie ko 38 fisadi or anya ko 22 fisadi vot milenge
 However, in a survey conducted earlier, the NDA was said to get 42 per cent of the votes, which means that the popularity of NDA has declined by two per cent in this survey
 agar aaj kii taarikh main chunaav hote hai, to NDA ko 309 seat, UPA ko 102 or anya ko 132 siton par jeet milegi
 NDA seat has declined this time as compared to previous survey
 pichley survey main endie ko 349 or upie ko 75 siten milane kii baat kahi gai thi
 According to a survey conducted by India Today and KARVY Insights from 30 December 2017 to 9 January 2018, Narendra Modi is the choice of 53 percent of the people for the post of Prime Minister
 vahiin 22 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki rahul gandhi desh ke behtareen pradhanmantri ho sakate hai

 is survey main 19 rajyon ke 97 sansadeey kshetra or 194 vidhansabha kshetra ke 12,148 logon ko shaamil kiya gaya
 Taking the SP-BSP, UPA will increase, keeping in mind Kunbaserve, it can be said that if the Opposition i
e
 Congress, TMC, BSP and SP are united, then UPA will get 38 percent votes
 yani NDA or UPA ke bich vot kaa antar do fisadi rah jayega
 Similarly, if TMC, BSP and SP come with the Congress, then UP can get 202 seats, while the NDA will get only 258 seats and others will get 83 seats, according to the survey, even today people will be the biggest Consider the issue
 29 fisadi logon kaa kahana he ki berogari sabase badi chunauti he, jabaki 23 fisadi log mahangaai ko sabase bada mudda maanate hai
 Apart from this, 17 percent people consider corruption as the biggest issue
 rahul kii lokapriyata main jabardast uchhaalgujrat chunaav ke baad congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata main jabardast ijapha hua he
 During this time, the difference of popularity of Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi has decreased by 24 percent
 survey main yah baat bhi saamne ai ki dakshin bharat or muslim bahul ilaakon main aaj bhi indira gandhi hi sabase lokapriy netaa hai

 agar kaamkaaj kii baat karen, to 20 fisadi logon ne kaha ki piem modi kaa kaamkaaj bahut acha rahaa, jabaki 41 fisadi logon ne sirf acha bataaya
 In addition, 25 per cent of the people described Modi's functioning as PM on average, while nine per cent of the people described it as bad and four per cent described it as very bad
 modi sarkaar main jetali sabase behatar mantriagar modi sarkaar ke sabase behatar mantri kii baat kii jaae, to 26 fisadi log arun jetali ko sabase behatar mantri maanate hai
 After this, Rajnath is at second place with 24 percent
 iske baad 23 fisadi ke saath sushamaa swaraj sabase behatar mantri hai
 Apart from this, 18 percent people have described Nitin Gadkari as a better minister

 14 per cent people described the Modi government as corruption free government
 iske saath hi 14 fisadi logon ne notebandi or 11 fisadi logon ne GST ko lagu karne ko modi sarkaar kii badi uplabdhi bataaya
 If Mamata is the best CM, Yogi Adityanath on the fourth, if you talk about the best Chief Minister, then there is no BJP Chief Minister on the top three positions
 chauthe paaydaan par upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath pahunche hai, jabaki 29 main se 19 rajyon main bijepi ke netritv vaali sarkaar he
 According to the survey, Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee is the best chief minister with 12 percent votes, while Nitish Kumar is second with 11 percent
 iske baad nau fisadi ke saath arvind kejariwal tisare sthaan par hai
 Apart from this, Yogi Adityanath is fourth with nine percent
 haalanki aankadon kii drushti se dekhen, to kejariwal or yogi adityanath baraabar hai yani donon kaa tisare sthaan par tassop he
 Australia recently had a tough time taking the wickets of Cheteshwar Pujara in the Test series on their pitches and India created history by winning the series for the first time
 vah test siries main australia ko australia main haraane vaali bhartiya upmahadweep kii pehali team ban gai
 But even more difficult is to push Virat Kohli from first place in India Today's 'desh ka Mood' survey

 Former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has not come down from his place despite retiring from Test matches to play Twenty20 and ODI matches
 australia main match jitaane vaali do behtareen paariyaan khelkar vanade siries main jeet dilaane ke saath dhoni ne ek baar phir sabit kar diya he ki lakshya kaa safaltaapurvak peechha karne main ve ab bhi ek bharosemand khilaadi hai
 He has won the Man of the Series award for the first time since 2011
 37 varshiya dhoni ne apane pradarshan se dikhaa diya he ki ve philhal antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas nahin lene ja rahe, khaskar jab unke sambhavit uttaradhikari rishabh pant (21 varsh) ne gavaskar-border siries main shandaar 350 banaae hon or 20 kaich lene kaa kirtiman hasil kiya ho
 Rohit Sharma, who captained the absence of Kohli, who is second in the ICC ODI rankings, falls just below Dhoni
 suchi main bhubaneshwar kumaar or jasprit bumara kii maujuudagi dikhaati he ki desh main gendbaajon kii andekhi nahin kii jaati he

 teesraa naam sina nehwal kaa he jo behatar nateezon ke liye ek baar phir apane puraane coach pulela gopichand ke paas laut ai hai
 The women in the survey may not be on top but their achievements are not small as the respondents of the survey made no mistake in identifying players from different sports, such as boxing (mary Kom) and cricket (mithali Raj and Harmanpreet Kaur)
 haalanki cricket ke purush khilaadi ab bhi desh ke logon main sabase lokapriy hai
 And if they continued to win in this way, especially on foreign soil, then their popularity will continue
