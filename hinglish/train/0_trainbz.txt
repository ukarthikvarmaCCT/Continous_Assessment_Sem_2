 Salamishra, in his book 'in Quest of a Meaningful Life', says Dushyant Kumar, who takes Ghazal to every word, his first visit was a completely personal journey

 He further said, the time was very short, but we managed to provide him accommodation in the Ashtabhuja Inspection Bungalow
 meri patni ne apane haathon se pradhanmantri ke kamare ko sajaayaa tha
 According to the author, during the tour, Gandhi worshiped in the Ashtabhuja temple at night and then returned to the bungalow

 Mishra said, i was not ready for such a demand
 vah asahaay mahasoos kar rahe the, tabhi unke tehseeldaar swechha se vindhyachal kshetra se jalebi or mathri lekar aae
 He told the confused collector, don't worry about these small things
 mishra ne kaha, tehseeldaar daudkar gaye or desi ghi se taiyaar garm jalebi, mathri or achaar lekar aae
 i breathed a sigh of relief
 mujhe baad main bataaya gaya ki pradhanmantri desi (sthaneey) naashtaa karke kaaphi khush hui
 'doordarshan' that begins in India History of television Once when Mishra was going towards the Ashtabhuja temple, a 'sadhu' praised him for ensuring good roads, electricity and drinking water facilities for the pilgrims
 unhone jiladhikari se kaha, tum acha kaam kar rahe ho or mujhe vishwaas he ki ek din tum uttar pradesh prashasan ke pramukh banoge
 Mishra said, i did not take these words seriously and completely forgot it in the bustle of administrative life

 After meeting Chief Minister Yogi last week, Chief Minister Yogi has completed preparations to shoot down the officers in Varanasi
 siem ne varanasi main kendra sarkaar dwaara chalaae gaye vrihad nirmaan yojanaon ko teen saal baad bhi puraa nahin kar paane ke liye doshi adhikariyon ke khilaaf kade kadam uthaae jane kii baat kahi
 According to sources in the state government, the Chief Minister has tried to put pressure on the government departments after the three big projects related to Varanasi have not been completed yet
 jin teen ahm projects par mukhyamantri kaa khaas dhyaan he usamen varanasi airport se shahar tak chadak chaudeekaran project, shahar ke liye nayaa ring road kaa nirmaan or shahar ke bich-bich 776 karod rupee kii laagat se ek bade fliover kaa nirmaan shaamil he
 Significantly, after meeting Prime Minister Modi last week, CM Yogi instructed the officials to complete these projects related to pm's constituency by June 2018
 gauratlab he ki mana ja rahaa he ki pradhanmantri modi june main varanasi kaa daura kar sakate hai or isiilie rajya sarkaar shahar ke lambit kaam ko puraa kar lenaa chaahati he
 Read this: Yogi's branding will shine like Modi's Gujarat UP? According to the state government data, the work of new ring road of Varanasi is currently 51% completed, while the project of widening from airport to city has been completed 71%
 vahiin shahar ke bich-bich nirmaanadhin fliover kaa kaam atak gaya he or isse shahar main trephic kii vyavastha behad kharaab ho chuki he
 All these construction projects were started by the Central Government in 2014 itself, but the deadline of these projects has been increasing since last one year
 ise padhein: sirf trump or kim nahin, modi samet ye bhi lekar baithe hai 'tabaahi kaa batan'iske alaava varanasi ke dinapur main 533 karod rupee ke sivej treetment plant ko bhi disambar 2017 tak puraa kar liya janaa tha lekin kinhin kaarnon se is dedline ko bhi badhaakar march 2018 kar diya gaya he
 Also, two national highways to connect Varanasi to the two major cities of Sultanpur and Gorakhpur have also not been completed
 is project se jude logon kaa daawa he ki abhitak varanasi prashasan ne naishanal hive athurity ko is kaam ke liye jameen kaa adhigrahan karke nahin diya he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi unfurled the national flag at the Red Fort on October 21 last month and unveiled a plaque to mark the 75th anniversary of Azad Hind Fauj, created by Subhash Chandra Bose
 uttar pradesh pisies-2011 kii mukhya pariksha ke nattejey pichley saal july main jab aae to ve apane saath ek tufaan bhi lekar aae the
 The dam of patience of students who were constantly accused of rigging in the recruitments of Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission suddenly broke down and the streets of Allahabad became fiercely
 goliyaan chalin, sir phute, bason ke shishe toote or giraftaaryaan huin
 The students alleged that the second examination is in its place, but "yadavism" has gone completely even in Uttar Pradesh's largest PCS examination
 chaatro ne is tarah ke nateezon ke liye ayog ke adhyaksh anil kumaar yadav par pakshpaat ke aarope lagaae
 Yadav could not even escape these allegations as he is the ultimate responsibility of any examination result as the chairman of the commission
 baad main mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne nitiyon main badlaav kiya or nyaay kii ummid main chaatr apane kamaron main laut gaye
 After this, in December 2013, the final result of PCS-2011 came out and the confidence of the students was broken again
 ayog ko pataa tha ki ye nattejey nayaa bakheda lekar aaenge isliye ayog ne badi safai se pehle to number hi ek maheene baad saarvajanik kiye or ve bhi is tarah ki koi chaatr sirf apane number dekh sake, vah bhi password se
 That is, what happened in Uttar Pradesh PCS-2011 was hidden very clearly
 lekin india today ne chaar maheene kii padtaal ke baad ayog ke simsim daravaaje ko khol liya or pariksha main mili numberon ke gorakhdhandhe tak pahunch banaai
 India Today obtained copies of the official marksheet of all the 389 candidates who were successful in PCS-2011, which are neither being given through RTI nor can any other student see on the marks commission website of any other student
 baharhaal, pisies-2011 ke nateezon main do tathy sabase chaunkaane vaale rahe
 First - Out of 86 students selected in the Other Backward Classes, about 50 students belonged to the Yadav caste
 isse bhi bada chaunkaane vaala tathy rahaa-ekaadh apwaad ko chhodkar yadav jati ke safal abhyarthiyon ko saakshaatkaar main 200 main se 135 se 140 ke bich ank milanaa
 The 140 marks figure also matters because it has been a tradition in the Commission over the last few years that students are awarded between 80 and 140 marks in interviews
 agar kisi ko 80 se kam yaa 140 se zyada ank milte hai to saakshaatkaar mandal kaa adhyaksh us par apni vishesh tippanee karata he
 That is, up to 140 marks can be awarded in an interview without any additional accountability
 pariksha parinaam main aisa sanyog bana ki yadav jati ke ve chaatr jinke ank mukhya pariksha main tamaam duusare chaatro se kam the, ve bhi saakshaatkaar main adhiktam ank paane main kaamyaab rahe
 On the other hand, the general class students got an average of 115 marks in the interview, the students of non-yadav OBC castes got an average of 110 points and the SC / ST students got an average of 105 marks in the interview
 pisies ke topper himanshu kumaar gupta ko bhi saakshaatkaar main mahaj 115 ank hi mili (dekhen-teble 1, 3 or 4)
 Not only this, all the students of OBC category who have been upgraded in the general category, all those students are also incidentally only Yadav caste
 saamaanya category main chaynit hue yadav chaatro ko mila liya jaae to kul yadav chaatro kii sankhya 54 tak pahunch jaati he (safal yadav abhyarthiyon kii yah sankhya unke upnaam main jude yadav shabd or kuch maamalon main jutai gai jaankaree par aadhaarit he
 Likewise, there is always room for minor modifications in the figure)
 saakshaatkaar ke ankon ke alaava mukhya pariksha main apanaai ja rahi scalling pranali par bhi sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai
 The scaling system is adopted because many subjects like mathematics and science are given higher numbers than many subjects of the Faculty of Arts
 is vividhta ko ekarupata dene ke liye chaatr ko mili vaastavik ankon ko scalling formule ke hisaab se sanshodhit kar diya jaataa he
 The Commission publishes this formula at the time of advertisement of the examination
 pratiyogi pariksha kii taiyaari kar rahe vicky khan ke shabdon main, ‘‘kareeb ek panne ke is formule ko aam aadmi thik vaise hi samaj saktaa he, jaise cricket premi dakworth louis formule ko samajhate hai
 You have to trust him more than you understand
 ’’ lekin pisies-2011 main yah bharosa bhi tutaa he
 Taking the Hindi paper of the main examination, a student got 140 and 132 numbers in the first and second papers respectively, 187 after scaling
 47 or 158
 32 was judged
 vahiin duusare chaatr ke 140 or 120 numberon ko kramshah 136
 82 and 118
 11 aanka gaya
 In both these cases, Yadav is also a student of scaling
 pisies pariksha ke antim parinaam kaa yah vishleshan ek baar phir ayog ke adhyaksh anil kumaar yadav kii bhoomika ko sandigdh bana detaa he
 However, Yadav says that the post of the Chairman of the Commission is constitutional and "I do not have to respond like judges
" ’’ lekin ve yah jumala jodpha nahin bhoolatey ki maamla ‘‘adaalat main vichaaradhin he
 "the Secretary of the Commission talks on this issue and his name is incidentally Anil Kumar Yadav
" lekin is inkaar ke baavjood pehle se hi jati vishesh ko sarankshan dene ke aaropon se ghiri or loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main maat kha chuki sapa sarkaar ke liye pisies pariksha kaa yah vishleshan nayaa sirdard dene vaala he
 Consider the case of Santosh Srivastava, the lawyer who challenged many of the commission's exam results in Allahabad High Court, "the first question that arises is that there are 234 castes in the obcs in Uttar Pradesh
" aise main agar sirf ek jati ke log obisi kaa 58 fisadi kota le jaaenge or baaki 230 jatiyaan sirf 42 fisadi hissedari par simat jaaengi to aarakshan kii mul bhaavana kaa matlab hi kya rahegaa
 No matter how meritorious it is, but these results are showing inclination towards the results towards a particular caste
 ’’udhar, ‘‘pratiyogi chaatr sangharsh samiti’’ ke binar tale pisies-2011 ke nattejey ke khilaaf janhit yachika daayar karne vaale avanish kumaar pandeya sidhe ayog kii karypranali par sawalia nishaan lagaate hai, ‘‘elahabaad main ladke-ladkiyaan 10-10 saal se is ummid main taiyaari karte rahete hai ki ek na ek din unki mehnat rang laaegi
 But the way the Commission is adopting unilateral attitude in every exam result, the students are heartbroken and the mind is boiling with anger
 ’’ pratiyogi parikshaon ke liye ‘‘brahmi’’ saamaanya hindi’’ kitaab ke lekhak avanish kii baat ko sire se khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The charge of "yadavism" is strengthened even if we consider some other examination results that came after Yadav, considered close to a senior sp's Rajya Sabha MP, became the Chairman of the Public Service Commission
 pichley saal sidhe intervyuu ke jariye peedblyoody main junior ejeeniyar (computer) ke 48 padon par hui bhartee main obisi ke hisse main 58 fisadi (yadav 42 fisadi) or saamaanya varg kii shrenee main 23 fisadi (brahman 12
 5 percent) posts
 rajya sarkaar ke samskruti nideshaalay main kshetra sahaayak ke ek maatr pad par jab intervyuu ke madhyam se bhartee hui tab bhi isi jati kaa abhyarthi sabase yogya niklaa
 When two recruitments were to be held on the post of commerce spokesperson, a person of caste was selected for both reserved and unreserved posts
 samajashaastra ke pravaktaa ke liye jab 19 padon par bhartiyon huin, to saamaanya varg kii 9 siton main se 4 siten yadav jati ke khate main chali gayi
 See the desperate comment of 23-year-old Shaligram Bind of a poor family who came to Allahabad to prepare for the Civil Services Examinations, "if the Yadavas continue to be recruited, the oppressed like us should give up our intention to sit in the PCS
 ’’ hindi sahitya, arthshaastra or raajnneeti shaastra se bi
 a
 karne ke baad compitishan kii duniya main kadam rakhane vaale is ati pichhadaa varg ke ladke kaa post hausala ayog kii saakh ke sankat ko or badha detaa he
 The 37-year-old Jatashankar Maurya, who came from Jaunpur to Allahabad, could not qualify the 2011 PCS Mens and now says, "whatever happened to the PCS, i will be devastated if the results of the examinations are to come, if i also have the same result
 ’’nateezon main pakshpaat kiya gaya he yaa phir yadav samaaj ke abhyarthi vaaki atyant medhaavi ho gaye hai, yah to adaalatein yaa ayog ke kartadhartaaon kaa antahkaran kii bataa saktaa he
 But for Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, such results will certainly not bring good political signals
 kya kehete hai adhyakshavahin upi lok seva ayog ke adhyaksh anil kumaar yadav kehete hai, " ayog ke adhyaksh kaa pad sanvaidhanik pad he or main koi pratikriya dene ke liye baadhya nahin hum
 Anyway, the matter is still in court
 "(upi lok seva ayog ke adhyaksh anil kumaar yadav )neeche dekhie kin-kin jatiyon ke abhyarthiyon ko mili kitne nabanr- After the shouting that came out of the women's protection home in Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, now new certificates of oppression and illegal business are coming out
 is nari sangrakshan grih main na sirf ladakiyon ko jabaran deh vyapaar main lagaaya gaya, balki ye puraa santhaan hi avaidh rup se chal rahaa tha
 Indeed, irregularities were found in the investigation of this institution
 jiske baad pichley saal isaki manyata rad kar di gai
 The DPO of Deoria said that the mother Vindhyavasini had been found unreasonable earlier in the Women's Protection Home operated by the Women's Training and Social Services Institute, on the basis of which her recognition was postponed
 shashan se ye aadesh bhi hua tha ki sabhi bacchon ko yahaan se transfar kar diya jaae
 Despite this order, girls were forcibly kept in the institute
 yahaan tak ki santhaan main registerd bacchiyon kaa sahi record tak nahin he
 The girls used to say that Girja Tripathi, who runs a big mother-in-law training institute, used to call girls as big mothers and the elder mother used to get business done by scandalizing Mamta
 kabhi devaria to kabhi gorakhpur main ayyaashon kii havas mitaane ke liye ye bacchiyaan bheji jaati thim
 From here, a girl escaped by breaking the chains of oppression and somehow the woman reached the police station
 police ko jab usne aapbeetee sunai to uski neend khuli
 The Thanedar called the SP and then the police force immediately traveled to the institute
 santhaan par chapa maaraa gaya or 24 ladakiyon ko police ne is santhaan ke narak se chhudaa liya
 Police said 42 girls' names are listed in the list of conservation homes, but only 24 were found on the spot in the raid
 baaki 18 ladakiyon kaa pataa lagaaya ja rahaa he
 He said that a 10-year-old girl from Bihar's Betia district somehow left the conservation house on Sunday evening and reached the police station
 vahaan usne sangrakshan grih kii aniyamittaaon ke bare main jaankaree di
 According to the girl, after four o'clock in the evening, many people used to come in black and white cars every day and take the girls along with Madam, she returned crying late at night
 sangrakshan grih main bhi galat kaam hota he
 Director Arrested SP said that Director Girija Tripathi and her husband Mohan are not giving satisfactory answers about them

 It was created by Brian Acton and Jane together
 hamane ko- founder bryan acton se baatcheet kii he
 Currently is the chairman and CEO of Acton Signal Foundation
 aaj tak tech se unhone kaha he ki ab whatsapp vaisaa nahin he jaisaa unhone banaaya tha
 Brian Acton and Jane sold whatsapp to Facebook in 2014
 fasebuk ne iskaa adhigrahan 14 farvari 2014 main kiya or iske liye company ne 19 billian dollar kharch kiye
 Both these founders also became part of Facebook and continued to head whatsapp
 haalanki 2017 main bryan ne whatsapp chhod diya
 Bryan is currently the Chairman and CEO of the Signal Foundation, which he started in 2018
 isse pehle bryan yahuu or aipal main bhi kaam kar chuke hai
 The Signal Foundation works on data security
 bryan acton ne aaj tak tech se baatcheet main kaha he, ‘mujhe lagata he whatsapp ne apni pahchaan kho di he, kyonki ab whatsapp ke donon founders company chhod chuke hai
 Brian has spoken several times in public on the question of selling whatsapp to Facebook and has also said that there was a lack of experience
 bryan fasebuk kii policy ke khilaaf hai or haal hi main lagaataar logon se fasebuk delit karne ko kehete hai
 He does not like the new model of whatsapp and believes that Facebook has made whatsapp hollow by sharing advertisements and data
 haal hi main mark jakarberg ne elaan kiya he ki watsap, massenger or instagram ko marz karke cross plateform miseging kaa feechar diya jayega
 When we asked Brian about this too, he said that it is very difficult to succeed
 bryan acton aaj tak tech se kaha he, ‘ab fasebuk product experience ko marz (milaane) kii koshish kar rahi he
 This is a difficult task and it is not easy to succeed 'brian wanted to make whatsapp paid earlier, so that users' data does not have to be compromised
 lekin fasebuk kii vajah se aisa nahin ho paaya
 There was a rift between the two founders of Facebook and whatsapp, as Facebook said at the time of the acquisition that whatsapp would be kept separate
 lekin baad main watsap ke founders ko laga ki fasebuk watsap ke kaam kaaj main interfare kar rahaa he
 Significantly, Brian Acton and Jane Kum worked at Yahoo
 unhone 2007 main yahuu chhod diya or kuch samay ke liye kaam se brake liya
 After some time both of them applied for job in Facebook, but they were rejected
 2009 main in donon ne mil kar watsap banaaya or 2014 main fasebuk ne hi watsap ko 19 billian dollar (lagbhag 13 kharab rupee) main kharid liya
 As it was, the female officer came out of the room at four in the morning and told the hotel staff the whole thing

 vahiin kuch mahilaayein aisi bhi hoti hai jo ye sab kuch pahananaa to chaahati hai lekin anderarms ke kaalepan or ganda hone kii vajah se pahan nahin paati hai
 The underarm of some people is black since childhood, while the color of the underarm of many people becomes darker as they age
 kaale anderarms ko saaf karne ke gharelu upaay jaanane se pehle ye bhi jaananaa jaruri he ki ye kaale kaise ho jate hai
 Many times, shaving too much, using a cosmetic product, causes dead-cells to turn underarm black
 iske alaava agar aap bahut tang kapade pahenti hai to bhi aisa ho saktaa he
 There is also a possibility of this due to a hormonal infection
 anderarms ke kaalepan ko dur karne ke gharelu upaay:1
 It is better to do waxing to remove unwanted hairs from underarm
 isse bal kaaphi andar se nikal jate hai or saath main ded-cells bhi hat jate hai, jisase twachaa saaf ho jaati he
 2
 aap chahen to anderarms ke kaalepan ko dur karne ke liye besan, dahi, neembu or haldi kaa pack bana len
 Applying it in underarms for 15 to 20 minutes per day will be of great benefit
 3
 Potato is a natural bleach
 aap chahen to pratidin nahaane se pehle aalu ke kuch tukade katkar anderarms main ragaden
 Doing this will reduce blackness
 4
 Sometimes, excessive use of deodorant also causes blackness in the underarm
 ho sake to iskaa sanyamit istemaal karen or anderarms kii badboo ko dur karne ke liye duusare gharelu nuskhon kaa istemaal karen
 Cleaning the underarms with alum reduces odor
 5
 Applying sandalwood and rose water paste also reduces the blackness of underarm

 Gadkari has sought answers to some questions from the Prime Minister about 'inflation, poverty and food anarchy'
 inamen prakand arthshaastri maane jane vaale manmohan singh se puche gaye sawaalon kii suchi is prakaar he:1
 Why India's inflation is the highest in the world? 2
 aisa kyon he ki vishwa str par jab yah ausatan ek se do pratishat he, bharat main 11 pratishat kyon he?3
 Why is the price of sugar in India twice the world average? 4
 gehun or anya khaadya samagriyon kii keemat 80 pratishat adhik kyon he?5
 Why did it happen that the first 48 million tons of sugar 12
 50 rupaye prati kilo ke hisaab se niryaat kii gayi or baad main ise 22 rupaye se 32 rupaye kilo ke hisaab se aayaat kii gayi?6
 Ministers continue to make fictitious statements about food shortages and under-production
 iske peeche sarkaar ke nihit swaarth kya hai?7
 By making such predictions about the shortage of grain production, are the prices being controlled or the chaos spread? ‘is tarah kii harkaton se aap kise laabh pahunchaa rahe hai satorion, jugaduon yaa bahurashtriya companiyon ko?’9
 'on the one hand you are claiming that poverty has decreased and on the other hand the Planning Commission had stated that in 2005 the population living below the poverty line is 31 crores and in December 2009 the Tendulkar Committee said that it is 42 crores
 aisa kyon?’10
 On one hand, the food grains in the government godowns are overflowing and rotting, why are their prices soaring and the poor are forced to eat half their stomach? 11
 kya yah sach nahin he ki sarkaar dwaara niyukt saxena samiti ne kaha he ki 51 pratishat garibon ko bipiel rashan card nahin diye gayi hai, jisase ve iske tahat sasti daron par khadyann paane se vanchit hai

 yah plus code google maps par kaam karegaa
 According to the company, this has been started to make it easier to find address in India
 hafte bhar pehle google ne chupake se is feechar ko logon ke liye jari kar diya tha or ab yah aadhikarik kiya gaya he
 Apart from this feature, six Indian languages have also been added to Google Maps Voice Navigation
 kya he Plus Code?aamtaur par par bharat main adress kaaphi lambey hote hai jinamein gali number, landmark, apartment number or flats number jaisi jaankariyaan hoti hai
 However, in countries like the US, addresses are smaller and easier

 Plus code is an open source solution that means you can generate the plus code of your home address by yourself
 yah free he or aap ise aasaani se bana sakate hai

 It has a six digit code with which the city cocode is associated
 ise aap khud se generetakarke kisi ko bhi bhej sakate hai
 By putting this code on Google Maps, anyone can come to your location
 aap soch rahe honge ki kyon na ham sidhe google maps ke jariye lokation share kar den
 But if you do not have internet, in such a situation you can send the code
 is code kaa phayda ye he ki google maps par aapke ghar kii ek pahchaan hogi or ise aap apni sahuuliyat ke hisaab se kisi delivery, courier, food sarvice yaa phir apane doston yaa rishtedaaron ke saath share kar sakate hai
 This code has to be inserted in the search field of Google Maps and it will navigate directly to your home

 According to Google, you can use this plus code on many occasions to make it easier for temporary events, emergency services and complex addresses
 kyon khaas he Plus Codeyaha free he or open sorce he aap khud apana adress jod sakate hai
 It can also be used offline
 plus code ko posters, sin board yaa paper par print karaayaa ja saktaa he
 Under this, people can use it even without mobile
 plus code google par un jagahon ke liye bhi kaam karata he jise map nahin kiya gaya he
 In an emergency, you can share this code with the emergency service so that they can identify you and reach you
 google maps par adress aid kar sakate hangoogle ne google maps par adress jodne ke liye Add an address kaa opshan diya gaya he
 Through this feature, users can contribute to Google Maps

 Suren Ruhela, director of Google Maps Next Billion users, said during the event, "our objective in Google Maps has always been to organize location-related information and make it easy for Indian users
 is mishan ke liye adress sarching zyada ahm he
 'he has said that it is difficult to find a given home address in India
 yah lambey hote hai or or ise dhund paanaa mushkil hota he
 Finding millions of people and their addresses is also difficult in India, especially those who live in remote areas
 ham aise chalanges se nipatane ke liye patibaddh hai’google maps next billian yugers product lead krish ne kaha ki bharat lagaataar google ko inspire kar rahaa he or isse google maps ko or bhi behatar banaaya ja rahaa he

 'so, Asaram is a child rapist
 And he has been found guilty

 Patronizing him before he was exposed to be a pervert is no crime
 Let’s be fair and give him the benefit of doubt that he, like us, did not know

 There were few anti-hindi protests in Tamil Nadu and in the south that the Valley's crisis would fade and disappear in people's memories, which they rejoice in as 'normal conditions' —which means barbed wire fencing and The gunmen armed with Akraspa (armed Forces Special Rights Act) patrolling the deserted roads

 Or it could also be that Amit Shah is merely flying a kite to catch wind, with the thunder of knowing the possible reaction of the people
 aise main aklmand pratikriya yahi hogi ki is uksaave ko andekha kar diya jaae or is naadaani ke, jiskaa vaada kiya gaya he, asal niti banane kaa intjaar kiya jaae

 After all, we have seen a greater degree of anger than this suggestion of making Hindi first among the equal, harmless at one level

 This argument gets particularly difficult for me at this stage — because ultimately i see myself only as a Hindi person, who believes that Hindi, in particular, has a great ability to mobilize the democratic energies of Hindi regions, which Today, they are expressing themselves in such distorted, poisonous forms
 yah vah hindi he jo sahasrabdi ke dauraan vyaavhaarik taur par is mahaan desh ke samooche vistaar main saajha jindagi jeene vaale logon ke bich sanchaar ke madhyam ke taur par viksit hui he
 It is the language that contains infinite forms of local and regional dialects, all of which are sufficient for continuous communication and which people need most
 mote taur par bombai ke cinema kii badaulat yah hindi vyaavhaarik taur par pehle hi 'rashtriya' ho chuki he
 Of course, there is a need to work on this Hindi — a lot of work — so that it can build higher-level registers, be a bearer and storehouse of knowledge

 But in this really difficult task, there is no help from the intervention of another purist 'hindi' which emerged in the early 20th century

 The Constituent Assembly appropriately warned about this trend and even at the time considered it as 'hindi imperialism'
 yah 'hindi' kaumi yaa janata kii hindi se buniyadi taur par alag he
 This is the 'hindi' that i associate with 'gurugram' and 'prayagraj', which has become ugly due to the desire of Tatasam

 Rahul Gandhi netted, 'our food givers get shot when BJP asks for rights in New India?'

 On Monday, the second day of the winter session of the Vidhan Sabha, which started last Friday in Uttar Pradesh, the entire opposition in the house attacked the government together and created a ruckus about law and order and the support price of sugarcane
 uttar pradesh vidhanmandal ke donon sadanon- vidhansabha va vidhanparishad main bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ke sadasyon ne soobe main bigadati kanoon vyavastha ko lekar jamkar hangaamaa kiya or sadan main sarkaar ke khilaaf poster laharaae
 Members of the BSP shouted slogans coming close to the chair of the Chairman holding posters in their hands
 is bich rashtriya lokdal (ralod) or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne ganne kaa samarthan mulya 400 rupee prati quintal kiye jane kii maang ko lekar sadan main hangaamaa kiya
 State president of RLD Munna Singh Chauhan said that the house will not be allowed to run till the government declares the support price for sugarcane for the farmers in the house
 bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh lakshmikant vaajapeyi ne vidhansabha ke baahar samvaadadaataaon se kaha, 'hamane vidhansabha adhyaksh or mukhyamantri se milakar sadan kii kaarywahi 10 din or badhaane kii maang kii he
 The winter session of the House is so short that issues related to the people of the state cannot be properly discussed
 'baari hangaame ke bich mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne vidhansabha main pradesh kaa anupoorak bajet pesh kiya
 The budget is expected to be discussed on Monday and Tuesday
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha kaa sheetakaaleen satr 23 november se 30 november tak prastaavit he
 On the first day of the session on Friday, the state's Minister of State for Sports and Youth Welfare, Kameshwar Upadhyay, paid condolence and paid tributes at the assembly
 satr behad chota hone kii vajah se vipaksh lagaataar sarkaar kii manshaa par sawaal uthaa rahaa he
 The Aam Aadmi Party has been continuously working on its prospects in Gujarat
 isi kadi main dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke sanyojak 14 taarikh se 17 ke bich chaar din ke daure par gujarat main rahenge
 During this tour, Kejriwal will try to woo the Patidars
 kejariwal patidaaron ke garh mehsana main 14 kii raat rahenge or patidaar andolan ke dauraan police daman kaa shikaar hue patidaaron or unke parivaar waalon se milenge
 Also, Kejriwal will also meet the family of Shwetang who died during the police lathi charge in Ahmedabad
 to vahiin kejariwal 15 kii raat vadodara main bithaayenge
 Here Kejriwal will hold a meeting with Aam Aadmi Party workers
 jabaki 16 taarikh ko kejariwal surat main ek badi jansabha ko sambodhith karne ja rahe hai
 It is worth noting that when Anandiben Patel was the Chief Minister, the Aam Aadmi Party had alleged that BJP had used political power to pressure Kejriwal's public meeting by pressurizing the traders of Surat
 aise main somnath darshan ke liye jab kejariwal pahanche the to unhone surat main jald hi badi sabha karne kaa elaan kiya tha, jis ke tahat wo yahaan ek jansabha ko sambodhit karne vaale hai
 During these four days tour of Kejriwal, the politics of Gujarat will be very hot
 21 april ke din puure desh ne akshay tritiya manaai
 Among Hindus, this day is considered auspicious to buy gold
 lekin sona kharidne ke liye yahi ek din tay nahin he
 Buying gold before Dhanteras, Diwali and most other festivals is considered auspicious
 yahi vajah he ki hindustani duniya bhar main sone ke sabase bade kharidaar hai
 India imported around 850 tonnes of gold in 2014-15
 adhikariyon kaa yah bhi anumaan he ki desh main kareeb 175 ton sone kii taskari kii gai
 In March 2015 alone, 121 tonnes of gold were imported, compared to 48 in March 2014
 5 ton zyada he
 Despite such a huge amount, according to the World Gold Council, only 557 in India's government treasury
 7 ton sona he
 India ranks 11th in terms of government reserves of gold, while the US has 8,133
 5 ton sone kaa bhandar he or vah duniya main pehle number par he
 Then where does the hundreds of tons of gold imported go? Mainly in private lockers
 takreeban 22,000 ton sona or sone ke jevaraat nijee vyaktiyon, pariwaron, mandiron or nyaason ke paas hai
 This gold reserves is probably the largest in the world
 is vishaal bhandar kaa ek bada hissaa mandiron ke treston ke paas devataaon ke aabhushanon, sikkon or sone ke biskuiton ke rup main jamaa he, jiske 3,000 ton se bhi zyada hone kaa anumaan he
 However, the management of any temple is not ready to tell the exact figure about this repository of gold
 arthshaastri sone ke is bhandar ko niskriy yaa vyarth maanate hai, jiskaa hamaari arthvyavastha main koi yogadan yaa upyog nahin he
 Gold accounted for 28 per cent of India's current fiscal deficit or import-export imbalance in 2012-13 as unnecessary imports
 narendra modi sarkaar sone ke isi bhandar kaa phayda uthaakar use sakriy puunji main badalanaa chaahati he
 Beginning in May, the government plans to convert these reserves into currency by making them an investment option
 nivesh ke ye vikalp hai: sone ko bainkon main jamaa karke byaaj kamanaa or sone ke bond, jinhen baad main bechaa ja sake
 This capital, lying dormant after the government is in possession, can reduce gold import expenditure and thus help reduce the fiscal deficit
 lekin is yojana par koi bhi hami bharne ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 The trusts of the temples say that the gold lying in their chests has been offered to the devotees for centuries
 masalan, tiruanantpuram main shripadmanabhaswami mandir kii tijoriyon ko hi len
 It is believed to have a huge storehouse of gold, which is worth more than the Sri Venkatesh Temple at Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh, considered the richest of Hindus
 guuruvayur sthit shri krishna mandir or sabarimala sthit bhagwaan ayappa mandir (donon kerala main) ke bare main mana jaataa he ki unke paas hajaaron karod ru
 There is a treasure of denominated gold
 lekin travnakor, cochin or malabar devswam board is yojana ke khilaaf hai
 These boards oversee 3,890 temples in Kerala
 unhen dar he ki bank unhen sone kii silliyon yaa pattiyon main badal denge, jisase unka mulya khatm ho jayega
 In fact, a source in the Travancore Devaswom Board says that the jewelery he had donated during the indo-china war was returned to him as gold ingots
 kushal kaarigaron ke abhaav ke kaaran unhen dobaaraa aabhushanon main tabdeel nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Trusts of some temples oppose earning interest on gold offered to God
 kerala ke mukhyamantri ukvaman chandi, jo khud isai hai, ve bhi sone kaa mudrakaran karne ke khilaaf hai
 They have said, "we will not allow the central government to hand over the precious jewelery of Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple or any other place of worship without the consent of devotees and temples
" "is maamle main thirumala tirupati devsthanam (titidi) ekmaatr apwaad he, jo andhra pradesh main shri venkateshwar mandir kaa prabandh dekhtaa he
 Apart from central banks, it is considered the owner of the largest gold reserves in the world
 haal ke varshon main titidi ne sone ke aabhushanon ko 22 carat ke cinnkon main badalane ke liye mumbai kii taksaal bhejnaa shuru kiya he
 These coins are sold to devotees all over the world
 bhagwaan ko chadaaye gaye sone ke jevar bainkon ko de die gaye hai
 Melt them in the mint and 0
 995 grad tak shuddh banaakar sone ke biskuiton ke rup main johariyon ko udhaar de diya jaataa he or unase byaaj kamaaya jaataa he
 After the deposit period is over, they are returned as gold and not as cash
 aanandji kalyanji trust ne bhi sone ke apane bhandar ko maamuli byaaj par bainkon ko de diya he
 The trust looks after the management of 1,300 Jain temples in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat
 aise hi duusare trust jaise ki shri arasuri ambaji mata devsthan trust, jo prasiddh ambaji mandir kii dekharekh karata he, or jamnagar main shri dwarkadhish mandir devsthan samiti ne sona jamaa karne kii is yojana main ruchi dikhaai he
 Meanwhile, the managers of the Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai have welcomed the idea with just one objection
 is mandir trust ke adhyaksh narendra murari rane kehete hai, ''yah yojana agar phydemand, surakshit or acha byaaj dene vaali hogi to ham apana sona rashtriyakrut bainkon main jamaa karenge
 "actually the interest rate can prove to be important in opening the mouth of the gold chests lying idle
 shiridy main shri sai baba santhaan ke kaaryakari adhikari rajendra jadhav kehete hai, ''bainkon ko ek pratishat kii maamuli byaaj dar se kahin adhik byaaj dena hoga
 "but many people are against it
 mumbai main sone ke ek kaarobaari kehete hai, ''bhagwaan ko chadaaye gaye sone par mandir kaa byaaj kamanaa paap he
 “his family has donated 200 kg of gold to temples over the years
 himachal main sarkaar ke niyantran vaale 29 mandiron ke liye ek vyavastha banaai gai he, jinka prabandhan himachal pradesh hindu public rilijiyas institutions or cheritable endoments act, 1948 ke tahat treston kii ore se kiya jaataa he
 Through this arrangement, 10 per cent of the total gold donated can be used in the development of the temple and 20 per cent can be invested in the State Bank of India gold deposit scheme
 ye mandir iske alaava or 20 fisadi hisse ko apane paas rakh sakate hai
 The remaining 50 per cent can be converted into coins and memorabilia as a token by purification with the help of Metals and Minerals Trading Corporation
 vittiya vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki daan ke rup main praapt saare sone ko galaakar sone kii eenton, chhadon yaa sikkon main tabdeel kar dena chahie or har maheene unki nilaamee kar deni chahie
 The money received from it should be deposited in the bank accounts of the respective religious trusts
 lekin sone kii is nai arthvyavastha kii shuruyaat karne ke liye pehle aasthaa main badlaav laane kii jarurat he
 The Modi government has taken the first step towards making Lokpal
 sarkaar ne guuruuvaar ko lokapal adhyaksh or uske sadasyon ke naamon kii sifarish karne ke liye aath sadasyeey ek samiti bana di he
 This committee will look for the candidates of Lokpal and then send their names to the government
 is samiti kii adhyakshata supreme court kii purv nyaayadhish nyaayamurti ranjana prakaash desai karengi
 According to the order issued by the Ministry of Personnel, former State Bank of India (SBI) Arundhati Bhattacharya, Prasar Bharati chairman a Surya Prakash and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) chief AS Kiran Kumar are members of the search committee
 unke alaava elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ke purv nyaayadhish nyaayamurti sakha ram singh yadav, gujarat police ke purv pramukh shabbir hossain es khandwawala, rajasthan cader ke sevanivrutt iees adhikari lalit ke
 Pawar and former Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar are other members of the committee
 aath sadasyeey khoj samiti ko lokapal or iske sadasyon kii niyukti ke liye naamon kii ek suchi kii sifarish karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 According to the language, Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh said that the process of Lokpal selection is proceeding according to the guidelines laid down in the Lokpal Act
 ek varisht adhikari ne kaha ki yah kadam kaaphi myne rakhata he kyonki sarkaar ne khoj samiti ke gathan ke saath aage badhane kaa faisla kiya he jabaki loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne pradhanmantri narendra modi kii adhyakshata vaali lokapal chayan samiti kii baithkon kaa bahishkaar kiya he
 He said that the search committee is a major step towards the formation of Lokpal
 samiti jald hi apana kaamkaaj shuru karegi
 Four years after the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act was passed in 2013, it has been decided to constitute a search committee
 khadge is aadhaar par chayan samiti kii baithkon kaa bahishkaar karte aa rahe the ki unhen samiti kaa purnakalik sadsy nahin banaaya gaya tha
 He rejected the invitation on six occasions (1 March, 10 April, 19 July, 21 August, 4 September and 19 September) this year as a 'special invitee' to attend the selection committee meetings
 gauratlab he ki khadge ne sarkaar se lokapal adhinium main sanshodhan karne kaa anurodh kiya tha, taaki loksabhaa main sabase badi vipakshi party ke netaa ko chayan samiti main shaamil kiya ja sake or is silsile main ek adhyadesh laayaa jaae
 Actually, according to the Lokpal Act, only the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha can be a member of the selection committee whereas Kharge does not have this status, so he is not part of the committee
 lokapal chayan samiti ke adhyaksh pradhanmantri hai
 Its members include the Lok Sabha Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition in the lower house (lok Sabha), the Chief Justice of the country (CJI) or a judge of the apex court nominated by him and an eminent jurist or others to be nominated by the President

 Why this slowdown has occurred, Sanjay Dutt, MD and CEO of Mumbai-based Tata Realty and Infrastructure, explains many factors of the recession

 But how helpful will these measures be to revitalize the real estate sector? There are no immediate solutions ahead, but big players in the industry suggest some necessary interventions to revive the real estate sector: Bring the economy to life: Experts say That the primary reason for the decrease in demand is a drop in consumption overall

 Make loan flow easier: Another major factor in the problem is the ongoing problems with the NBFC sector, which provides loans to buyers and developers

 Kapoor considers steps such as banning refinancing of the project a warning bell

 Make RERA Uniform: The real estate sector has traditionally been known for its unorganized nature, the needless delay of developers in completing the project and misusing the buyers money of unscrupulous developers or altering the project plans
 Which is a setback to buyers
 achal sampatti bazaar bade paimaane par nakadi main bhugtan ke liye bhi kukhyat he or is tarah sampatti ke rup main 'kaale dhan' ko thikaane lagaaya jaataa rahaa he
 It has made the sector opaque and has attracted a large number of investors who have played a gamble in this market — investing their money in real estate and seeing a good opportunity and selling it at a high price

 However, some people say that the sector was going through a recession so the provisions of RERA could be deferred for some time
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki dhanchaagat parivartan alpavadhi main anischitata laate hai
 "the timing of implementing RERA was probably not right," says Dutt
 desh main jin chizon ko badalane main 70 saal lag gaye hai, unhen ek maheene main thik nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Jia does not agree with this
 ve kehete hai, ''rera unheen sari chizon ko muhaiyaa karaane ko kahata he jiskaa develpar ne vaada kiya he
 If the developers are unable to fulfill their promise, then they are lacking and obviously they will be in trouble
 '' ve is baat kii ore bhi ishaara karte hai ki rera to keval do saal pehle lagu hua he, bazaar main mandi to paanch saal puraani he

 Increase business comfort: Many people are of the opinion that the government needs to improve ease of doing business and cost improvement in the real estate sector
 dutt kehete hai, ''bharat main puunji kii laagat viksit raashtra kii tulana main bahut adhik he, jo ek samasya he
 This affects the profitability of a business where margins are in the range of 10 to 15 percent
 '' ve kehete hai ki sarkaar ko achal sampatti main adhik nivesh ko aakarshith karne ke liye, buniyadi dhaanche se judi anumodan prakriya main teji lani chahie
 Some others also believe that the government needs to make the approval process easier to attract investment
 jaisaa ki agarwal kehete hai, ''kisi project ko shuru karne ke liye 20 se adhik anumatiyaan leni padati hai, jise puraa hone main chah maheene se ek varsh ke bich samay lag jaataa he

 lagaataar badalte raajnneetik ghatnakram ke bich congress party ne yah saaf kar diya he kivijay bahugunahi banenge uttarakhand ke agle mukhyamantri
 The Congress core group has decided that Bahuguna will be crowned by Sonia Gandhi's favorite Bahuguna at the throne of Uttarakhand
 bahuguna mangalvaar shaam hi shapath lenge
 Significantly, after the resignation of Minister of State for Agriculture and Parliamentary Affairs Harish Rawat, the politics of Uttarakhand had become hot

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who came to count the achievements of his central government for four years, said in a meeting on the Mahanadi coast in Cuttack, “the Odisha government has misled the people on the waters of the Mahanadi
 kisaanon ke liye sinchai main sudhaar ke unke prayaas niraashajanak hai
 The BJP will do justice to the farmers of Odisha
 '' iske saath hi odisha menmahanadeepar 33 saal puraani jang mahajang main tabdeel ho gai he
 This time the Chief Minister is himself the Prime Minister compared to Naveen Patnaik
 modi ne patnayak kaa naam liye bagaiyr yahaan tak kaha ki rajya sarkaar mahanadi ko lekar gambhir hi nahin he, varanaa jal vivaad par centre ke prayaason ko thukraayaa nahin jaataa
 He said that the initiative of the Center regarding the formation of tribunal was also not accepted and Nitin Gadkari also wrote a letter which was ignored
 modi bole, mahanadi va rajya kii anya nadiyon kaa aadhe se zyada pani samudr main chalaa jaataa he
 Farmers face irrigation problems
 bees saal hone ko aae hai, loar indira sinchai project ab tak puraa nahin hua
 "the old war over the waters of the Mahanadi between Odisha and Chhattisgarh has started anew after the Prime Minister's statement
 biju janata dal (bijd) ne modi par jhooth bolne kaa aarope madhte hue kaha ki mahanadi par bhaajapa politics kar rahi he
 The Prime Minister appears in defense of Chhattisgarh
 isi saal chhattisgarh main vidhansabha chunaav bhi hai
 At the same time, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan raised another controversy
 ek ore jahaan, modi ne chhattisgarh kii bhaajapa sarkaar kaa bachaav kiya vahiin dharmendra pradhan ne mahanadi par chhattisgarh ke mukhyamantri raman singh kii aalochana karte hue kaha, "mahanadi vivaad par raman singh kaa bayaan nindaneey he
 The BJP unit of Odisha clearly believes that there will be no compromise with the interests of Odisha
 '' is tarah bhaajapa main hi alag-alag sur sunai de rahe hai
 On the other hand, the BJD leaders say that if the Chhattisgarh government stops the work of building a barrage on the head upstream, then know that they are friendly to Odisha
 mahanadi ke astitv kii ladaimhanadi suraksha abhiyaan yatra ke paradeep main samaapan samaaroh par bijd adhyaksh or mukhyamantri patnayak ne jal vivaad kii gend bhaajapa kii rajya ikai ke paale main daal di
 He said, "if the leaders of this party had any pain towards the public, they would have opposed the Chhattisgarh government on Mahanadi
 naveen ne kaha ki bijd ke liye mahanadi janamudda he
 BJP is shedding crocodile tears
 '' bijd pravaktaa sulochana das kahati hai, "pradhanmantri ne odisha kii janata se jhooth kaha he ki unki sarkaar kii ore se tribunel kii pahal ko nahin mana gaya
 If this happens then why would the BJD government go to the Supreme Court? ”the then Union Water Resources Minister Sanjeev Balyan had said in Lok Sabha on August 10, 2017 that this issue could not be resolved through negotiations
 tribunel gathan kaa draft bhi taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 But after the Central Government turned hostile , the Tribunal was formed by order of the Supreme Court on the petition of the o Disha Government

 They also served to fuel the controversy
 vahiin jal purush rajendra singh kehete hai, "donon hi rajya mahanadi par raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 He has nothing to do with the suffering of the general public and farmers
 ''nadi kaa 53 pratishat jal samudr main haalanki bijd ko modi ke is aarope kaa jawaab nahin sujh rahaa he ki nadi kaa aadhe se zyada pani samudr main bah jaataa he, rajya sarkaar ise bachaa nahin paati
 Odisha's Water Resources Minister Niranjan Pujari had said in the last session in response to the question of Congress's Nav Das, that 53 per cent of the water flowing in the state falls directly into the sea
 unke bayaan par vipaksh ne jal prabandhan na hone ko lekar sarkaar ko gheraa tha
 The minister says that 50,686 million cubic meters of water from major rivers flow into the sea every year as the state's water management is not particularly effective
 agar is pani ko krishi kii ore mode diya jaae to sinchai kii samasya kaaphi had tak hal ho sakati he
 According to a report by the Department of Water Resources, not only Mahanadi, the other rivers of the state are in the same condition
 brahmani nadi kaa 56, baitarani kaa 41, rishikulya kaa 26, vanshadhara kaa 64, bumbdang kaa 66, kolab nadi kaa 58, nagvali kaa 70 or suvarnanakha kaa 63 pratishat pani samudr main girtaa he
 Nav Das said that Odisha is suffering from heat and farmers are suffering due to lack of irrigation
 sarkaar apana hi pani manage nahin kar paa rahi he
 The water of 11 major rivers here gets into the sea due to lack of water management
 jal sansaadhan kii ek report ke anusaar, mahanadi ke 48,732 million cubic meter pani main 22
 Only 73 percent irrigation and 0
 23 pratishat peyajal tathaa 2
 3 percent is used in industrial use
 iske alaava, 21
 5 percent is used environmentally
 baaki 53
 23 percent of the water is wasted by falling into the sea
 odisha sarkaar kaa aarope he ki hirakud baandh se apstream par chhattisgarh sarkaar ke banawaye gaye chah bairaj—kalma, saradihi, mironi basantpur, sivorinaryan or samoda bairaj—mahanadi ko odisha pahunchane se roak lete hai
 These were constructed with the intention of benefiting the industries
 kendriya jal ayog se manjuuri lenaa to dur, padosi rajya odisha tak ko nahin bataaya gaya ki bairaj banaaya ja rahaa he jabaki niyamanusaar suchit karnaa chahie
 It is clear from Chhattisgarh's arbitrariness on the waters of Mahanadi and the neglect of the Center that the BJP is in question in Odisha

 The three-day summit began on Thursday
 ye nakshaa china kii commers ministry ne pesh kiya
 China's move to include the whole of Jammu and Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh in India is astonishing, because recently China had destroyed thousands of maps in which Arunachal Pradesh has been shown as the state of India
 china ke is kadam se jaankaar bhi hairaan hai
 Experts in india-china affairs are now trying to find out whether showing the whole of Kashmir as part of India is not China's trick to please India
 bataa den ki pichley saal november main china ke sarkari channel CGTN ne pakistan ke nakshe se pakistan adhikrut kashmir ko alag dikhaaya tha
 Excluding Pakistan Occupied Kashmir from the map of Pakistan may also have an impact on the china-pakistan Economic Corridor
 bharat is project ke pioke se guzarane kaa virodh kar chukaa he
 China has invested heavily in infrastructure projects in pok
 ise lekar bharat apni naaraazgi jataa chukaa he
 Relations between the two countries had also deteriorated due to the issuance of stapled visas by the Chinese to residents of Jammu and Kashmir a few years ago

 In England, there is growing conflict between Russia and Britain over poisoning a former spy agency KGB
 britain ke videsh mantri boris johnson ne rus ne purv dabl agent sargei scripal ko jehar dene ke maamle main rus ko aade haathon liya he
 He described the attack as a revenge against Russia
 boris ke mutabik, agent ko jehar dena raashtrapati putin kii taraf se ek sanket he ki rus ke badale kii aanch se koi batch nahin saktaa
 Let me tell you, Russia's former double agent Sergei Skripal is still in a coma
 unki beti bhi aspataal main bhartee hai
 They were found unconscious on a bench in the town of Salisbury
 johnson ne videsh maamalon kii pravar samiti se kaha ki rus paala badalane waalon ko bataanaa chahta tha ki agar ve kisi anya desh kaa samarthan karenge to unke saath kya hoga
 He also claimed that he chose Britain for the attack because he has repeatedly criticized Russia's unfair treatment
 gauratlab he ki purv dabl agent sargei scripal ko jehar dene ke maamle se britain or rus ke sambandhon main tanaav paidaa ho gaya he
 Putin has dismissed allegations that Putin has already dismissed allegations of Britain and its allies as absurd that a chemical attack on Skripal (66) and her daughter Yulia (33) on March 4 in Salisbury, UK Russia is behind
 donon philhal aspataal main hai or unki haalat gambhir bani hui he
 Britain has said that the Soviet-designed military class nerve agent Novichock was used against Scripple
 britain ne di thi naagariktabta den ki rus ke sevanivruth sainya khufia adhikari scripal ko britain ke liye jasusi karne ke aarope main rus ne varsh 2006 main 13 varsh kii sajaa sunai thi
 However, he was later granted amnesty and Britain granted him citizenship
 vah tab se britain main hi rah rahe hai
 Britain, France, Germany and the US issued a joint statement last week besieging Russia for a chemical attack, blaming Russia for the aggressive use of chemical weapons for the first time since World War II
 sibar atake kaa bhi darpurv roosi jasoos ko britain main jehar die jane ke maamle par donon deshon (rus or britain) ke bich gahraae kootnithik tanaav ke bich sambhavit roosi sibar hamale ke khatre ke maddenjar britain ke bainkon, urja or jal companiyon ko hai alert par rakhaa gaya he
 23 diplomats have been expelled
 Earlier, on Saturday, on Saturday, the UK announced the expulsion of 23 diplomats
 rus ke videsh mantralay ne desh main britain ke rajdoot lorie bristo ko talab kar is nirnay kii jaankaree di
 Russia's move comes after Britain's decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats
 kendriya grih mantralay ne kaha he ki gaiyrkanoonee taur par rah rahe 40 hazaar rohingya desh se baahar nikaale jaaenge
 Rohingya Muslims are living in different places in the country and are now becoming a problem
 sutara bataate hai ki aane vaale samay main bharat main avaidh rup se myanmar se aae rohingya ko satat prakriya ke tahat dhire-dhire waapas bheja jayega
 According to the information, most of the Rohingya Muslims currently live in Jammu and Kashmir, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, delhi-ncr and Rajasthan
 grih mantralay ke paas uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar is samay yuanechasiaar ke paas bharat main rah rahe 14,000 se adhik rohingya ke bare main jaankaree maujuud he
 However, according to other information that is available with the Ministry of Home Affairs, about 40 thousand Rohingyas are living illegally in India
 aapako bataa den ki avaidh videshi nagarikon kaa pataa lagaana or unhen waapas bhej dena ek nirantar prakriya he, centre sarkaar yani grih mantralay videshi adhinium 1946 kii dhara 3(2) ke tahat avaidh videshi nagarikon kaa pataa lagane or unhen waapas bhejne ke liye mili adhikaar ke aadhaar par unhen bhejne kii prakriya shuru kar rahaa he
 The state governments and the administration there have also been given powers to identify and prevent foreign nationals living illegally including Rohingya and to send them back
 bharat main sabase zyada ronhigya muslim jammu main based hai
 There are about 10,000 Rohigya Muslims living there
 kya he maamladansal myanmar sarkaar ne 1982 main rashtriyata kanoon banaaya tha jisamen rohingya musalamaanon kaa naagarik darja khatm kar diya gaya tha
 Since then, the Myanmar government has been forcing Rohingya Muslims to leave the country
 haalanki is puure vivaad kii jad kareeb 100 saal puraani he, lekin 2012 main myanmar ke rakhin rajya main huesampradayik dangone isamen hawa dene kaa kaam kiya
 The rioting between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhist people in northern Rakhine killed more than 50 Muslims and about 30 Buddhists
 isi kram main kai rohingya musalmaan bharat main bhi ghus aaye the or ab centre sarkaar in par ection lene ke mood main hai
 What is the dispute? The dispute between Rohingya Muslims and the majority Buddhist community of Myanmar has been going on since the independence of Myanmar in 1948
 bataaya jaataa he ki rakhin rajya main jise arakaan ke naam se bhi jaataa he, 16veen shatabdi se hi musalmaan rahete hai
 This was the period when there was British rule in Myanmar
 1826 main jab pehla anglo-burma yuddh khatm hua to uske baad arakaan par british raaj kaayam ho gaya
 During this time the British rulers started bringing laborers from Bangladesh to Arakan
 is tarah myanmar ke rakhin main padosi mulk bangladesh se aane waalon kii sankhya lagaataar badhati gai
 These were the same people who migrated from Bangladesh to Rakhine, who are known as Rohingya Muslims today
 rohingya kii sankhya badhati dekh myanmar ke general ne vin kii sarkaar ne 1982 main burma kaa rashtriya kanoon lagu kar diya
 Under this law, citizenship of Rohingya Muslims was abolished

 No Congress leader has claimed candidacy against his nomination
 parivaarwaad kaa aarope rahul gandhi kaa peechha kar rahaa he
 Sonia was also following Gandhi, followed by Rajiv Gandhi and Indira Gandhi as well
 1998 ke baad 2001 main sonia gandhi jab adhyaksh banane vaali thi tab jitendra prasad ne apana namakan bharaa tha
 And many Congress leaders also stood with him
 jitendra prasad haar gaye magar sonia gandhi ko pehali baar chunaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 No elections were held against Sonia Gandhi from 2001 to 2017
 2017 main rahul gandhi ko kisi chunaav kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa he, unke kilaaf koi maidan main nahin utraa, maa ke baad bete ko adhyaksh banaaya ja rahaa he
 There is talk of Nehru Gandhi familyism but it is more evident since Rajiv Gandhi
 hamen aaj or azaadi kii ladaai ke samay main koode pariwaron main antar karnaa hoga, magar is antar ke saath ki wo ladaai main desh kii azaadi ke liye koode, ye satta par apni pakad banaae rakhane ke liye adhyaksh yaa mantri ban rahe hai
 Jawaharlal Nehru was made Prime Minister by Mahatma Gandhi
 azaadi kii ladaai ke dauraan nehru 9 saal jail main rahe the
 Kamala Nehru, Nehru's wife, was herself a freedom fighter
 nehru ke pita motilaal nehru bhi azaadi ke nayak the
 Nehru's sister Vijay Lakshmi Pandit was a freedom fighter
 nehru ke jivan main hi 1959 main indira gandhi congress adhyaksh ban gai thim
 Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy became president in 1960
 1969 main sindicket se loha lete hue indira gandhi ne apni party banaai
 Indira Gandhi had to prove more in politics
 congress ai banaai thim
 Losing and winning is a different story
 indira gandhi ke samay main parivaarwaad kii buniyaad padi
 Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister but Sonia Gandhi remained in the post of President, Manmohan Singh became Prime Minister
 bijepi aarope lagaati rahi he ki satta sonia ke paas he, manmohan kathputli hai
 Even after this, the Congress won the election in 2009 when Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister
 sonia gandhi adhyaksh thim magar wo chunaav manmohan singh kaa tha
 Manmohan Singh lost in 2014
 sardaar patel kaa bhi parivaar raajnneeti main rahaa he
 Vitthalbhai Patel was the eldest brother of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 unhone si aar das, motilaal nehru ke saath swaraj party bana lee thi
 Vitthalbhai Patel was the president and speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1925
 unheen ke chote bhai sardaar ballab bhai patel grahamantri bane
 Patel was identified not with the younger brother of Vitthalbhai, but from the peasant movement in Bardoli
 sardaar patel kii maut ke baad nehru ne 1952 main unki beti maniben ko loksabhaa kaa tikat diya
 On the dispute, Nehru said that she is a daughter but has been involved in the freedom struggle since 1930
 1957 main patel kii beti maniben patel or bete dayabhai patel donon loksabhaa kaa chunaav lade, jite
 Later Maniben Patel also became a member of Rajya Sabha but after that the Patel family was not heard
 aaj patel parivaar kaa us viraasat par koi daawa nahin he
 He has no party
 laal bahadur shastri kaa parivaar bhi raajnneeti main aayaa magar utane eemaandaar or sade netaa ke beton ko khaas raajnneetik laabh nahin mila
 While one stayed in Congress and the other in BJP
 biju patnayak ke bete naveen patnayak bhi usee kii misaal hai
 In India's politics, one to one leaders were born outside the purview of families, who changed politics, but their party also went into the lap of familyism
 rahul gandhi bahut dinon tak is parivaarwaad ko lekar sankoch main rahe magar ab lagata he ki is aalochana se ubar gaye hai, magar yah sawaal unka peechha karata rahegaa
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi had said in an interview to Times Now that 'I do not take the name of my family again and again, i must have taken it once or twice only, the point is that i was born in this family, this is my selection was not
 maine dastakhat nahin kiye the ki main is parivaar main paidaa hona chaahunga
 i am against the concept of dynasty
 ' Rahul should also be asked and the same question Uddhav Thackeray, Aditya Thackeray, Prakash Singh Badal, Sukhbir Badal, Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, Lalu Yadav, Tejaswi Yadav, Karunanidhi, Stalin, Ram Vilas Paswan , Chirag Paswan should also be asked
 jawaab koi nahin detaa he
 Is there any rule in BJP that those whose fathers have been Chief Ministers, Ministers or mps will never become party presidents or prime ministers, has BJP said so
 kya jin dalon main adhyaksh kisi parivaar kaa nahin banataa he, vahaan zyada aantarik loktantr he, jawaab he nahin
 Is the election of the President there in accordance with the democratic spirit, the answer is no

 parivaarwaad ke kaaran inhen mauka mila lekin kya inamen se kai isi khubi ke kaaran raajnneeti main tike rahe? varun gandhi kii apni raajnneetik pahchaan he, us pahchaan main sanjay gandhi ke pita hone ke sanyog ke alaava or kya he
 Should Varun Gandhi have got 1 lakh 80 thousand votes in Sultanpur in the name of Sanjay Gandhi or on his work
 janata kyon vot detii he, parivaar kaa naam dekhakar
 Isn't there a question from the public? andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ke bete naaraa lokesh bhi tidipi ke mahasachiv hai, pita kii cabinet main mantri hai
 KT Ramarao, son of Telangana Chief Minister KCR, is also a minister in the father's cabinet
 kya bijepi parivaarwaad ke kilaaf apane sahyogi dalon ke kilaaf bhi aakraamak he? bijepi ne uddhav thakare, sukhbir badal or chiraag paswan ke kilaaf parivaarwaad kaa abhiyaan kyon nahin chalaaya
 BJP is aggressive on Congress for Rahul Gandhi becoming president, in response, Congress is asking whether Amit Shah became president from Manonayan or by election, BJP is not answering it but by asking this question, Congress also does not answer bjp's question Has been sawaal yah he ki partiyon ke bheetar aantarik loktantr he, kya vahaan he jahaan parivaarwaad he, kya vahaan he jahaan parivaarwaad nahin he
 If the selection of Rahul Gandhi has to be debated honestly, then this question has to be sustained or else there is no benefit
 adarsh udhaaharan aapako bharat se nahin milegaa
 London politics can be met
 jaise lebar party kaa hi udhaaharan lete hai
 The comments corbin or unka gut lebar party main 30 saal se haashiye par tha
 Corbyn continued to become MP by the vote of party workers
 jabaki nitiyon ko lekar unka party netritv se sidhaa virodh he
 The Labor Party had two Prime Ministers, against whom they opposed
 sthaneey str par kaaryakartaaon ke vot se jitate rahe
 In Britain, activists choose candidates locally, becoming members by paying a fee of £ 25
 kaaryakarta hi saansad or pradhanmantri kaa ummidavaar chunate hai
 To become a candidate, the leaders campaign among the workers about their policies within the party, giving speeches that do not happen in India
 iske baad bhi britain or america main parivaarwaad kii tarah duusari tarah kaa vaad panamaa dhan or kuleenata kaa
 In Britain, many Prime Ministers continued to be educated in the same school or college
 yah bhi apane aap main ek tarah kaa kulinavaad he
 Nevertheless, it is far better than India's system that the workers will decide who will be the party's candidate, not the Sangh Parivar nor the Gandhi Parivar
 jawahar laal nehru ko mahatma gandhi ne pradhanmantri banaaya tha
 Nehru spent 9 years in prison during the freedom struggle
 nehru kii patni kamala nehru khud swatantraaa senaanee thim
 Nehru's father Motilal Nehru was also a hero of independence
 nehru kii bahan vijay lakshmi pandit swatantraaa senaanee thim
 It was in Nehru's life that Indira Gandhi became Congress President in 1959
 1960 main neelam sanjeev reddy adhyaksh ban gaye the
 In 1969, taking on the syndicate, Indira Gandhi formed her own party
 indira gandhi ko zyaada sabit karnaa padaa raajnneeti main
 Congress was formed
 haari or jitati raheen wo alag kahani he
 In Indira Gandhi's time, the foundation of familism was laid
 rajeev gandhi pradhanmantri bane magar sonia gandhi adhyaksh pad par hi raheen, manmohan singh pradhanmantri bane
 The BJP continues to allege that power is with Sonia, Manmohan is a puppet
 iske baad bhi manmohan singh ke pradhanmantri rahete congress ne 2009 main chunaav jeeta tha
 Sonia Gandhi was the president but the election was for Manmohan Singh
 manmohan singh 2014 main haar gaye
 Sardar Patel's family has also been in politics
 vitthal bhai patel sardaar vallabh bhai patel ke sage bade bhai the
 He formed the Swaraj Party with CR Das, Motilal Nehru
 vitthal bhai patel 1925 main central legislative asambeli ke adhyaksh or spikar the
 His younger brother Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel became the Home Minister
 patel kii pahchaan vitthal bhai ke chote bhai se nahin, bardoli ke kisaan andolan se thi
 After the death of Sardar Patel, Nehru gave his daughter Maniben a Lok Sabha ticket in 1952
 vivaad hone par nehru ne kaha ki ve beti hai magar 1930 se azaadi kii ladaai main shaamil hai
 Patel's daughter Maniben Patel and son Dayabhai Patel both contested the Lok Sabha elections in 1957
 baad main maniben patel rajya sabha kii sadsy bhi huin magar iske baad patel parivaar sunai nahin diya
 Today, the Patel family has no claim on that legacy
 unki koi party nahin he
 Lal Bahadur Shastri's family also came into politics but the sons of that honest and simple leader did not get any special political benefit
 jabaki ek congress main rahe or duusare bijepi main
 Biju Patnaik's son Naveen Patnaik is also an example
 bharat kii raajnneeti main pariwaron ke daayre se baahar ek se ek netaa bhi paidaa hue jinhone raajnneeti badal di magar unki banaai party bhi parivaarwaad kii god main chali gai
 Rahul Gandhi has been hesitant about this familyism for a long time, but now it seems that he has overcome this criticism, but this question will continue to follow him
 loksabhaa chunaavon ke samay rahul gandhi ne times nau ko die intervyuu main kaha tha ki 'main apane parivaar kaa baar baar naam nahin letaa hum, ek yaa do baar hi liya hoga asli, mudda yah he ki is parivaar main main paidaa hua yah meraa chayan nahin tha
 i did not sign that i would like to be born into this family
 main vanshavaad kii avadharana ke khilaaf hum
 ' rahul se bhi poocha janaa chahie or yahi sawaal uddhav thakare, aditya thakare, prakaash singh badal, sukhbir badal, mahabuuba mufti, faruq abdulla, omar abdulla, mulaayam singh yadav, akhilesh yadav, lalu yadav, tejasvi yadav, karunanidhi, stallin, ramvilas paswan, chiraag paswan se bhi poocha janaa chahie
 Nobody answers
 kya bijepi main koi aisa niyam he ki jinke pita mukhyamantri, mantri yaa saansad rahe hai ve kabhi party adhyaksh yaa pradhanmantri nahin banenge, kya bijepi ne aisa kaha he
 Is there more internal democracy in the parties where the president does not become a family, the answer is no
 kya vahaan adhyaksh pad kaa loktantric bhaavana ke anuroop nirvachan hota he, jawaab he nahin
 i spoke to Professor Ashutosh of Punjab University on this subject in a prime time of 2014 when he said that the Congress and the Akali, even though separate parties in Punjab, used to marry like Rajput kings to expand their power
 But their big leaders are in-law, daughter-in-law, son, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and brother-in-law
 ashutosh ne punjab uniwarsity kii chaatra gunarit cor ke eme main likhe parche kaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki prakaash singh badal ke cabinet mantri aadesh pratap singh unke damaad hai
 Adesh is the son of Pratap Singh Kairon, a Congress chief minister in Punjab for ten years
 captain amarinder singh kii patni, simranjit singh maan kii patni or beant singh ke baad congress ke mukhyamantri haracharan singh baraar kii bahu aapas main bahanen hai
 Similarly, the Majithia family was considered a Congressman but Surjit Singh Majithia's son Vikram Singh Majithia is now in Akali
 unki bahan kii shaadi dipti siem sukhbir singh badal se hui he
 Vikram himself is also an MLA and cabinet minister from Akali
 bhartiya raajnneeti main parivaarwaad ko lekar patric french ne ek gambhir adhyayan kiya he
 Patrick studied the family background of 545 mps of the 15th Lok Sabha while 156 mps belonged to the family background
 patric french ne dikhaaya tha ki 15veen loksabhaa main rashtriya lokdal 100 percent khandaani thi
 All its mps are dynastic
 purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh, ajit singh or unke bete jayant choudhary
 The 16th Lok Sabha is currently running
 kanchan chandra kii ek kitaab he, democratic dynasties, state party and family in contemporary indian politics, cambries uniwarsity press se chhapi yah kitaab 7645 rupee kii he
 According to this book, 100% of the mps in PMK, CPI are family members
 congress ke 47
 73 percent of the mps are family members
 bijedy main 40 fisadi saansad parivaravaadi hai
 33% of the mps in NCP are family
 bijepi main 14
 89 percent are family
 in adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki 2009 main 30
 07 percent of the mps were family members, their percentage was reduced to 21 in 2014
 92 pratishat rah gaya
 Research by both Patrick French and Kanchan Chandra has shown that there is familyism in the BJP but less than in many major parties
 kalyaan singh rajyapal hai, unke bete rajvir singh eta se saansad hai or naati sandip singh vidhayak hai
 Rajnath Singh's son Pankaj Singh is also an MLA
 kaisarganj ke saansad brijbhushan singh ke bete pratik bhushan, lalji tandon ke bete ashutosh tanjan vidhayak hai
 Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a minister in the Yogi cabinet, is also an example of familyism
 jayant sinha, anuraag thakur, piyush goyal sahit anek netaa paariwarik prishthbhumi se aate hai
 Due to familyism, he got an opportunity, but did many of them stay in politics because of this quality? Varun Gandhi has his own political identity, apart from the coincidence of Sanjay Gandhi being the father in that identity
 kya varun gandhi ne sultanpur main 1 lakh 80 hazaar vot sanjay gandhi ke naam par paaya hoga yaa apane kaam par
 Why does the public vote, seeing the family name
 kya janata se sawaal nahin he
 Nara Lokesh, son of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, is also the TDP general secretary, a minister in the father's cabinet
 telugana ke mukhyamantri ke si aar ke bete ke tii ramarao bhi pita kii cabinet main mantri hai
 Is BJP also aggressive against its allies against familyism? Why did the BJP not run a campaign of familism against Uddhav Thackeray, Sukhbir Badal and Chirag Paswan
 rahul gandhi ke adhyaksh banane ko lekar bijepi congress par aakraamak he, jawaab main congress puch rahi he ki amit shah manonayan se adhyaksh bane the yaa chunaav se, bijepi iskaa jawaab nahin de rahi lekin yah sawaal poochkar congress bhi bijepi ke sawaal kaa jawaab nahin de rahi he
 The question is whether there is internal democracy within the parties, is there where familism is there, is there where there is no familism
 agar rahul gandhi ke chayan par eemaandaaree se bahes kerani he to is sawaal par tike rahanaa hoga varanaa koi laabh nahin
 You will not get the ideal example from India
 landan kii raajnneeti se mil saktaa he
 Take the example of the Labor Party
 tippaniyan Corbyn and his group were marginalized in the Labor Party for 30 years
 corbin party ke kaaryakartaaon ke vot se saansad banate rahe
 Whereas he has direct opposition to the party leadership regarding policies
 lebar party ke do do pradhanmantri hue,jinase unka virodh rahaa
 At the local level, the workers continued to win with the vote
 britain main kaaryakarta sthaneey str par ummidavaar chunate hai, iske liye 25 pound fees dekar member banate hai
 The workers choose the MP and the prime ministerial candidate
 ummidavaar banane ke liye netaa baqayda party ke bheetar apni nitiyon ko lekar kaaryakartaaon ke bich prachaar karte hai, bhaashan dete hai jo bharat main nahin hota he
 Even after this, in Britain and America, another type of suit like familyism arises of wealth and nobility
 britain main to kai pradhanmantri ek hi skool yaa kalege ke padhe hue banate rahe
 This is also a kind of oligarchy in itself
 phir bhi bharat ke system se yah kahin behatar he ki party kaa ummidavaar koun hoga kaaryakarta tay karenge na ki sangh parivaar na hi gandhi parivaar
 Indira Gandhi had to prove more in politics
 congress ai banaai thim
 Losing and winning is a different story
 indira gandhi ke samay main parivaarwaad kii buniyaad padi
 Rajiv Gandhi became Prime Minister but Sonia Gandhi remained in the post of President, Manmohan Singh became Prime Minister
 bijepi aarope lagaati rahi he ki satta sonia ke paas he, manmohan kathputli hai
 Even after this, the Congress won the election in 2009 when Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister
 sonia gandhi adhyaksh thim magar wo chunaav manmohan singh kaa tha
 Manmohan Singh lost in 2014
 sardaar patel kaa bhi parivaar raajnneeti main rahaa he
 Vitthalbhai Patel was the eldest brother of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 unhone si aar das, motilaal nehru ke saath swaraj party bana lee thi
 Vitthalbhai Patel was the president and speaker of the Central Legislative Assembly in 1925
 unheen ke chote bhai sardaar ballab bhai patel grahamantri bane
 Patel was identified not with the younger brother of Vitthalbhai, but from the peasant movement in Bardoli
 sardaar patel kii maut ke baad nehru ne 1952 main unki beti maniben ko loksabhaa kaa tikat diya
 On the dispute, Nehru said that she is a daughter but has been involved in the freedom struggle since 1930
 1957 main patel kii beti maniben patel or bete dayabhai patel donon loksabhaa kaa chunaav lade, jite
 Later Maniben Patel also became a member of Rajya Sabha but after that the Patel family was not heard
 aaj patel parivaar kaa us viraasat par koi daawa nahin he
 He has no party
 laal bahadur shastri kaa parivaar bhi raajnneeti main aayaa magar utane eemaandaar or sade netaa ke beton ko khaas raajnneetik laabh nahin mila
 While one stayed in Congress and the other in BJP
 biju patnayak ke bete naveen patnayak bhi usee kii misaal hai
 In India's politics, one to one leaders were born outside the purview of families, who changed politics, but their party also went into the lap of familyism
 rahul gandhi bahut dinon tak is parivaarwaad ko lekar sankoch main rahe magar ab lagata he ki is aalochana se ubar gaye hai, magar yah sawaal unka peechha karata rahegaa
 During the Lok Sabha elections, Rahul Gandhi had said in an interview to Times Now that 'I do not take the name of my family again and again, i must have taken it once or twice only, the point is that i was born in this family, this is my selection was not
 maine dastakhat nahin kiye the ki main is parivaar main paidaa hona chaahunga
 i am against the concept of dynasty
 ' Rahul should also be asked and the same question Uddhav Thackeray, Aditya Thackeray, Prakash Singh Badal, Sukhbir Badal, Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, Lalu Yadav, Tejaswi Yadav, Karunanidhi, Stalin, Ram Vilas Paswan , Chirag Paswan should also be asked
 jawaab koi nahin detaa he
 Is there any rule in BJP that those whose fathers have been Chief Ministers, Ministers or mps will never become party presidents or prime ministers, has BJP said so
 kya jin dalon main adhyaksh kisi parivaar kaa nahin banataa he, vahaan zyada aantarik loktantr he, jawaab he nahin
 Is the election of the President there in accordance with the democratic spirit, the answer is no
 2014 ke ek prime time main isi vishay par maine punjab uniwarsity ke professor ashutosh se baat kii thi tab unhone kaha ki jaise mughal badshaah apni satta ke vistaar ke liye rajput raajaaon se shaadiyaan kiya karte the vaise hi punjab main congress or akali bhale hi alag dal hai magar inke bade netaa aapas main saas, bahu, betaa, damaad, beti or saalaa or sadhu lagate hai
 Giving an example of a leaflet written by Punjab University student Gunarit Kaur in MA, Ashutosh said that Prakash Singh Badal's cabinet minister Aadesh Pratap Singh is his son-in-law
 aadesh punjab main das saal tak congressi mukhyamantri rahe pratap singh kairon ke bete hai
 The wife of Captain Amarinder Singh, wife of Simranjit Singh Mann and daughter-in-law of Congress Chief Minister Harcharan Singh Brar are sisters after Beant Singh
 usee tarah majithia parivaar congressi mana gaya lekin surajeet singh majithia ke bete vikram singh majithia ab akali main hai
 His sister is married to Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal
 vikram khud bhi akali se vidhayak or cabinet mantri hai
 Patrick French has done a serious study in Indian politics about familism
