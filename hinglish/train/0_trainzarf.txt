 The Supreme Court on Tuesday objected to the plea of muslim parties that the two sacred scriptures of Hindus, 'valmiki Ramayana' and 'ram Charitmanas', did not accurately mention that Ayodhya, the birthplace of Lord Rama, was also asked by the court that Why should the devotees be deprived of believing that Lord Rama was born at a particular place
 pradhan nyaayadhish ranjan gogoi kii adhyakshata vaali paanch sadasyeey peeth muslim pakshakaron kii ore se pesh hue varisht adhivaktaa jafarayab jilani se sawaal kar rahi thim
 Jilani argued that the holy texts and even the ain-i-akbari of Abul Fazl do not mention the centuries-old belief of Hindus that Lord Rama was born in the central dome of the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid which is now Has been demolished
 peeth main nyaayamurti es e bobade, nyaayamurti di vaai chandrachud, nyaayamurti ashok bhushan or nyaayamurti es e nazeer bhi shaamil hai
 The bench said, "just because 'valmiki Ramayana' and 'ramcharit Manas' do not mention the exact place in Ayodhya where Rama took birth, can Hindus not believe that Rama is in a special place in Ayodhya?" Was born ''nyaayalay ne maamle kii sunwaayee ke 30wein din jilani kii is daleel par aapatti jataayi ki ine-e-akabari main 10veen isa purv se jude aitihaasik ghatnakramon kii choti se choti jaankaree he lekin usamen vivaadit sthal ke bhagwaan ram kaa janmasthan hone ke sambandh main hinduon kii aasthaa kaa zikr nahin hai
 However, Jilani agreed on the belief that Ayodhya was the birthplace of Lord Rama and that there was no dispute about the birthplace of 'ram Chabootare' in the outer verandah

 In 2014, the Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi started the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in memory of Mahatma Gandhi and appealed to the countrymen to keep the country clean

 martin macwasprail, 2018 main anusuchit jati-janajati (utpeedan nivaaran) adhinium, 1989 ke kuch praavdhaanon ko kamjor karne vaale supreme court ke aadesh kaa virodh karne ke liye sadakon par utre ek darjan se adhik daliton ne apni jaan ganvaai
 The court, in its observation, referred to the 'misuse' of the Act by 'vested interests', despite there being no researched credible data to corroborate this notion
 is tarah 20 march, 2018 ke aadesh main is durupyog ko rokane ke liye kanoon ke us praavdhaan par pratibandh laga diya gaya, jo shikaayat par giraftaar or aaropee ke liye agrim jamaanat kii anumati detaa he
 For the Dalits, it was a major setback
 unhone desh kii sarvocch adaalat se isaki ummid nahin kii thi, khaskar tab, jab unhone kabhi bhi apane maardarshak dow
 B
 aar
 Following Ambedkar's stated non-violent and constitutional methods, he never left the path of resistance
 is saal aktubar kii shuruyaat main, supreme court ne march 2018 ke aadesh ko waapas le liya or pehle ke nirdeshon ko hataa diya lekin daliton or adivaasiyon ne is mahatvapurn mile ke pathar kaa jashn apni jeet ke rup main kabhi nahin manaaya
 The wounds of the earlier court proceedings were deep and its scars remain, making it difficult to re-establish the same kind of trust in the judiciary
 daliton ke liye, aise mode koi nae nahin hai
 He has faced such situations many times in his difficult journey to secure his basic human rights
 'achhut' jati kaa bataakar pragati ke haq se vanchit kar die jane se lekar samaan naagarik ghoshit kiye jane kii is dushkar yatra main unhone aisi na jane kitni adchane dekhi hai, haalanki samaan naagarik kii baat ab bhi sirf kaagajon par hi zyada he, unke dushman zyada taqatvar rahe hai
 During colonial rule, he fought discriminatory laws in addition to society at large

 They had the most powerful armor for their defense - the most powerful armor out of the Constitution, including education, reservation, and even prohibition for slavery
 lekin badi mushkil se hasil ve sanvaidhanik guarantiyaan bhi ab khatre main hai
 In this long journey, Dalits come to a new turning point and realize that their last weapon, legal security is also in danger
 rajnatik morche par dekhen to kisi dalit party, jaise ki republican party of india, ke saath danke kii chot par khadey hone ke bajaae unhone mukhyadhara kii partiyon ke saath janaa behatar samajha
 Despite worshiping Ambedkar as a god, he did not want to risk being sidelined so went with mainstream political parties
 lekin ab rajnatik ekikaran kii is ranneeti ko lekar gambhir chintaaen ubhari hai
 Even though the NDA won the highest number of SC / ST reserved seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, giving it an edge, only the government figures show that atrocities on Dalits and tribals increased during its first term (see: edited by Martin mcewan bhide-bharat, Dalit Shakti Prakashan, 2019)
 jo baat sabase zyada pareshaan karne vaali he, vah he jatigat hinsa se dridhtaa se nipatane ke liye ek rajnatik ichhashakti kii kami
 The death of scavengers while cleaning sewer lines by hand is not considered 'atrocity'
 yah dalit voton ke avamulyan kii ore ishaara karata he, jo kisi bhi rajnatik dal ke liye ullekhneey rup se kabhi bhi achhut nahin tha
 The stain of untouchability is or should be a shame for India's largest democracy, which is now trying to become the world's leading economy
 bharat kii arthvyavastha or desh ke vikaas ko mahaan str tak lekar jane ke sankalp kaa dam bharne vaali vartmaan sarkaar bhi, apane purvavartiyon ke nakshekadam par chalate hue, is vaastaviktaa se dur dikhaai detii he ki bharat khud ko asprishyata se mukt karne main vifal rahaa he
 This is a social evil whose roots of atrocities on Dalits are very deep
 yah sthiti 'vikaas' ke myne par gambhir prashn uthaati he
 After independence, India did not see an enthusiastic social movement against untouchability as seen before independence
 iske vipareet, sarkaar aaj in muddon ko uthaane vaale un svaichhik sanghathanon ko daraati he jo asprishyata ke unmoolan, sir par mailaa dhone kii pratha khatm karne, daliton or adivaasiyon ke khilaaf hinsa jaisi chintaaon par sarkaar se sanvaidhanik rup se nirdhaarit karrwai kii maang karte hai
 In June 2016, it was disturbing to see the bitterness over the cremation of the body wrapped in constable Vir Singh's tricolor
 uttar pradesh ke firozabad jile ke nagala kewal gaanv ke dalit nat samudaay se taalluk rakhane vaale singh, pampor (jammu-kashmir) main hue ek aatankwaadi hamale main shahid aath siarpief javaanon main se ek the
 District officials had to struggle hard to persuade the powerful upper castes of Singh's village to allow cremation of their dead bodies on public land
 yah kahani bhi koi apwaad nahin he—sashastr bal ke dalit javaanon ke pariwaron ke khilaaf unke apane hi gaanvon main jatigat utpeeda kii baat koi nai nahin he, haalanki ve shaayad hi kabhi khabaren banati hai
 This should not surprise anyone
 aakhir kitne logon ko yah baat yaad he ki karnataka main sattarudh bhaajapa ke ek dalit saansad ko apane hi nirvachan kshetra ke ek gaanv main pichley sitambar main ghusane kii anumati nahin di gai thi? kya yah rashtriya str par hangaame kii vajah bana? kya yah virodh kaa paryaapt kaaran nahin tha? haalanki is par paradaa daalate hue yah dikhaaya gaya ki saansad ko sammaan dene ke liye graminon ne saansad ko gaanv ke baahar baithne ke liye ek kursi bheji thi
 Not only this, he said with pride that he does not indulge in discrimination and he did not allow the local Dalit MLA to enter the village like the MP
 yah sab police kii maujuudagi main hua
 And the government / governments maintain a silent silence
 isse bhi badtar baat to yah he ki sansad ke 88 dalit sadasyon ne bhi is vishay par chuppi saadhe rakhi
 The MP himself was seen trying his glorification through this incident and told that he himself had prevented the police from using force because he wanted to try to change the heart of the people by shaking their conscience
 unki pratikriya is baat kii ek maun sweekruti he ki saamaajik nyaay ke saadhan—kanoon, vot (16
 5 percent, not less than this) and political-educational reservation for Dalits, etc
 — have lost their edge
 yah din ke ujaale jaisaa spasht prathit hota he ki daliton ko samanta ke liye apane sangharsh kii ranneeti phir se taiyaar kerani hogi
 The crisis is deepened because Dalits have failed miserably to eliminate caste differences among themselves
 gujarat sthit jamini str par sakriy dalit sanghathan navasarjan trust (lekhak jiske sansthaapak hai) dwaara 2016 main kiya gaya, apni tarah kaa ek pehla adhyayan 'anderstanding antchablity (chuaachhut ko samajhnaa)', is tathy kii pushti karata he ki jaisaa jati aadhaarit bhedbhaav daliton or gaiyr-daliton ke bich dikhataa he, thik vaisaa hi bhedbhaav vibhinn dalit up-jatiyon ke bich bhi maujuud he
 It is evident that the Dalits themselves have deviated from Ambedkar's call to end caste discrimination
 haalanki chhutbhaye netaaon ne 1932 ke puna samjhaute ko lekar gandhi or ambedkar ke bich ke takaraav kaa hawala dete hue yuva daliton ke dimag main gandhi ke khilaaf bahut jehar bharaa he lekin tathy to yah he ki in donon mahaan vichaarkon kaa ek jaisaa yah maananaa tha ki naitik bal main kanoonee takat yaa ohade kii takat se kahin adhik aakarshan bal hota he
 Both were searching for a solution in their own way
 yah bahut shame kii baat he ki ek raashtra ke rup main, hamaare paas yudhak vimaanon par kharch karne ke liye bharpoor paise hai jo antat: kisi ko jeetne main madad nahin karenge, lekin hamaare paas kuposhan ke dansh jaise nirantar hamale ko rokane yaa adivasee maataaon or bacchon jaise sabase kamajoro kii raksha ko lakshith koi thos kaarykram nahin he
 We maintain the illusion that solutions to the problems of discrimination and injustice will come out of our political institutions
 is paheli par phir se vichaar karne or ek majboot naagarik samaaj ke mulya ko samajhane kaa vakt aa gaya he
 Ironically, Ambedkar's call to organize himself was understood by the rich and started to get organized, but the call for Dalits and Adivasis, the poor and the deprived, is ignoring Ambedkar

 bagdadi or uske aatankwaadiyon ne apni taaja harakat se usee jangal raaj kii yaad taaja kar di
 After the arrival of a Yazidi girl, some such stories of Baghdadi market have come to light, which are going to make the story stand
 sunai aapbeetheebagadadiyon ke changul se batch nikali nadia ke mutabikis ke aatankwaadiyon neusake gaanv ke kam se kam 150 logon ke saath use bhi sinjar se pakadaa tha or phir mosul lekar aa gaye
 Thousands of girls like Nadia were kept there
 phir un sabhi ko sex slave ke taur par bech diya gaya
 There she was raped along with all the girls including Nadia
 tohfon kii tarah ladakiyon kii adla-badali kii jaati rahi
 With those who were not ready for this, there was such a cruelty that they would see the color stand up
 baad main nadia kisi tarah un aatankwaadiyon ke changul se bhaag nikalne main kaamyaab ho gai
 Girls seem to be spoken like humans in the 21st century market of Baadi
 vahaan 50, 100, 150 dollar main ek-ek ladki bechi or kharidi jaati he
 These girls and women belong to enemy houses, that's why they are sold
 nadia par tutaa tha kaharanadia mahaj 21 saal kii he or insaanon kii aisi hi ek mandi main uski bhi boli lagaai gai thi
 He was also sold for a hundred or two hundred dollars
 bikne ke baad kareeb teen maheene tak nadia apane khariddaar maalik ke paas rahi
 And then one day, after getting a chance, somehow escaped from there after saving his life
 ab ye mahfuj he isliye apni kahani suna paa rahi he
 Before raising Nadia, her six brothers and mother were killed by ISIS militants
 ISIS ke changul main hajaaron ladkiyannadia iesas ke changul se nikal kar bhi khush nahin he kyonki usne apni ankhon se dekha he ki uski tarah 5800 yajidi mahilaayein or ladkiyaan ab bhi iesas ke kabje main hai
 Nadia wants to protect him too and wants to help him
 rape kar bataaya charitrahinmosul shahar par kabje ke baad ninevah kasbe iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ne chaaron mahilaon ke saath rape kiya tha
 But then later the same women were accused of being characterless
 jiske baad chaaron ko iesas kii sharia adaalat main pesh kiya gaya
 The Sharia court announced the death penalty by stoning all four, after which the four women were molested
 bagdadi ke bazaar main ladakiyon kii kharid-farokht karne vaale iesas ke aatankwaadi kitne khoonkhaar hai, iskaa khulaasa shaayad hi kabhi ho paata
 Some Yajidi girls like Nadia escaped their clutches in some way, then the truth came out somewhere
 tab pataa chalaa ki auraton ko parde main rahane kii hidaayat dene vaale iesas ke aatankwaadi khud hi kaise unhen beparda or rusavaa kar rahe hai
 In August 2014, these girls were abducted by ISIS militants along with their entire family
 tab yajidi birdari ke ye log iesas se bachane ke liye sinjar kii pahadiyon par ja chhipe the
 But the terrorists did not leave them there too and took about 5000 people to their hideout under the shadow of bayonets
 inamen se 2000 log to kisi tarah bhaag nikle, lekin jo teen hajaar log fanse rahe, unki jindagi jite ji nark ban gai
 Especially those women and children who were the easiest victims of ISIS terrorists
 ek nahin, kai baar bikati thi ladkiyandrasal, iesas ne in tamaam yajidiyon se islam kubul karne ko kaha lekin jab yajidi iske liye taiyaar nahin hue to unhen agava kar liya gaya, un par julm dhaaya jane laga
 Then the ISIS executioners kidnapped thousands of Yazidi girls and made them their sex slaves
 ye aatankwaadi jab chahen, jise chahen uthaate or uske saath manamaani karte
 If a girl was not ready for this, she would have shot him
 ab aise main ek ladki ke saath iesas ke aatankwaadi itane dinon kab-kab or kitni baar balaatkaar kar chuke hai, iskaa sahi-sahi hisaab ab khud unka shikaar baniin ladikayaan bhi nahin laga saktin
 But these girls narrate how ISIS terrorists used to sell them to become sex slaves in front of rich people after committing excesses with them
 or is tarah ek-ek ladkiyaan bisiyon baar bikati rahi, lutati rahi or rusavaa hoti raheen
 This innocent woman Iraqi journalist, who was locked in the cellars for months, recently saw such girls who escaped from the clutches of ISIS and tried to understand their pain
 jab in ladakiyon ne apni aapbeetee sunai, to use sun kar wo hairaan rah gai
 But the most shocking of all these stories was that of a 12-year-old anonymous Yazidi girl, with whom the ISIS executioners raped and persecuted for months
 aisi sabhi ladakiyon ko andhere tahkhaanon main band karke rakhaa jaataa or kai-kai dinon tak khaane-pine kii chijo tak se maharoom rakhaa jaataa
 As a victim, not a fighter, the militants of Ubriyangambagadi are especially behind the Yajidi girls
 iesas ne yajidi ladakiyon par itane julm dhaae hai ki unki kahani sun kar rongte khadey ho jaaen
 But despite all the oppression, these girls did not give up and have now started a cross-border battle with Baghdadi
 iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ke sabase bade khauf yani ladi brigade kii buniyaad padi, agast 2014 ko, jab iesas ne iraq main sinjar kii pahadiyon main ja chhipe yajidi samudaay ko luutane or barbaad karne kii galati kii
 Since then, about 10,000 girls in countries such as Iraq and Syria have been part of a separate Lady Fighter Brigade, colliding with ISIS militants, taking on them
 bhadak rahi he badale kii aagdarasal, agast 2014 main iesas ne jab iraq main pair pasaarne kii shuruyaat kii, to unhen vahaan ke alpsankhyakon main gine janevaale yajidi birdari ke log hi sabase soft torget lage
 Therefore, these terrorists selectively started looting and killing the Yazidis
 tab iesas ke julmo-sitam se ghabara kar is samudaay ne jaan bachaane ke liye sinjar kii pahadiyon kaa rukh kiya, lekin iesas ne vahaan bhi unka peechha nahin choda or yahaan se takreeban 5 hajaar logon ko agava kar liya gaya, jinamein auraton or bacchon kii bhi ek badi taadaad thi
 Now the Yazidis had only two ways, either to accept ISIS, to accept Islam or to die in agony
 lekin unhone ummid nahin chodi or yaheen iesas ke saath yajidiyon ke takaraav ke jis silsile kii shuruyaat hui wo har guzarate din ke saath lagaataar badhati gai
 Rihanna became an inspiration where the Kobanis opened a front against ISIS
 or inhen cobani ladakiyon main ek thi rihana
 This slim and slim girl, she got rid of such sixes of the terrorists that she became a public figure
 ek mote anumaan ke mutabik iesas ke haathon maare jane se pehle akele isi ladki ne sau se zyada iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko maut kii neend sula diya tha
 Rihanna's fame can be gauged from the fact that this picture of him holding a gun in his hands, which is a victory sign, was seen millions of times and tweeted thousands of times
 chhudaa raheen hai iesas ke chakkelekin ladakiyon ke haathon maare jane ke iesas ke khauf ne jaise mahilaon ko iesas ke khilaaf ladane kaa nayaa hausala de diya
 Immediately, the separate Lady Brigade in both countries started rescuing ISIS sixes
 aise hi brigadon main ek wipije ne to syria main iesas ko uske kabje vaali bahut si jagahon se peeche dhakel diya or saikadon aatankwaadiyon kii jaan lee
 And now the situation is that while getting out of the responsibilities of the family, wearing a bullet proof jacket and having a terrifying hand in hand, the girls of Lady Brigade have become a worldwide astonishment and surprise story, while one of the countries like Syria and Iraq Common photo

 The equation of the Rajya Sabha elections in Bihar changed many equations
 dushman dost ban gaya or puraane gile-shikave khatm ho gaye
 a decade and a half of hatred turned into love
 shabdon ke tir manuhaar main badal gaye
 Black changed to white and time went back several decades
 baat he bhi utani badi
 Nitish Kumar came to the ground with a pledge to change Lalu Prasad's chaotic Bihar into a well-governed Bihar
 janata ne unki eemaandaaree, patibaddhta or jujharupan ko saraahaa
 Handed them the power of Bihar
 sushasan kaa naaraa lekar nitish kumaar bihar ke rakhwale ban gaye
 He took up the front against anarchy and crime
 unhen apaar safalataa mili or janata kaa sneh bhi mila
 Nitish Kumar became one of the best administrators of Bihar
 lekin satta main ajab nasha hota he, aadmi use jitna chakhtaa he, uski chahat utani hi badhati jaati he,nitish kumaar ke saath aisa hi hua
 He thought of forming his government in Bihar by throwing the crutches of the BJP
 ahan ke bhav se bhare nitish kumaar ne bijepi kaa daaman chhodkar apane pairon main kulhadi maar lee
 He had to face the loss in the Lok Sabha elections
 unhone siem kaa pad chhodkar jan sahanubhuti lene kii koshish kii
 But that too did not help him and now he got caught by his arch rival Lalu Yadav
 yah bhartiya raajnneeti kii ek bhayaavah ghatana he
 If a leader who promises to bring good governance takes the responsibility of misrule, what will he be called? It is like getting oxygen for Lalu Prasad wandering in Viawan, away from power
 itane saalon se bihar main satta kii talash main lage argedy pramukh kii to lottery nikal ai
 But now many big questions have arisen
 araajaktaa or aparaadh ke nark se nikal kar bihar abhi khadaa hi hua he or use kai mukaam hasil karne hai
 But now again Nitish Kumar has taken the first step to push him into the dark tunnel due to his importance
 rajya sabha chunaav main unhone lalu yadav kaa ahsaan liya jo unhen sood ke saath chukaana padegaa
 Lalu is not made of that clay to become his friend again
 loksabhaa chunaav main karaari shikast ke baad se vah rajya main apni pahchaan banane kii jugat main the
 Now Nitish Kumar has given him the best opportunity
 jaahir he ab nae sameekaran banenge jo agle saal hone vaale vidhaan sabha chunaav tak chalenge
 He will try to save the government of Sakha of his student movement and will also charge it
 bihar ab phir araajaktaa kii ore bad rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar handled 18 ministries after stepping down from BJP
 prashasan main giravat ai or unke sushasan ke daawey par sawaal uthe
 Now he has played a new bet by creating a proxy CM
 koi yakeen nahin kar saktaa he ki yah vahi nitish kumaar hai jo kal tak sushasan, karmthata or eemaandaaree kii baaten karte the
 What will be on his mind about saving his government and returning to elections, only time will tell, but it is certain that Bihar has deviated from the path of good governance
 narendra modi kii khwahishen ab jagajaahir hai
 Many leaders, including BJP President Rajnath Singh, have conveyed a very clear message to people that Narendra Modi can be their party's prime ministerial candidate
 isaki bahut sambhaavnaaen hai
 But Modi has to face criticism from both within and outside the BJP
 shanivaar ko shivasena ke mukhpatr saamana main uddhav thakare ne narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhaa
 He wrote, 'narendra Modi says that he does not see the dream of becoming Prime Minister
 yahi baat unhen anya bijepi netaaon ko bhi samjaani chahie
 'uddhav wrote,' Modi has explained to a child that he will remain the Chief Minister of Gujarat till 2017
 chote bachche ko samajhaana bahut aasaan he, lekin ve apni hi party ke bade logon ko kaise samajhaayenge, jo unhen pradhanmantri pad kaa daavedaar banane main ek duusare se aage bad rahe hai
 Uddhav Thackeray said, 'A child can be pacified by giving him a chocolate, but in political sports this trick does not work
 yadi koi neshnal politics main aata he to jaahir he uske khwab oonche hote hai
 But Indian politics is very difficult
 kai utaar chadhaav hai
 Modi has many opinions about Modi in his own BJP, that is why he has not been declared as the prime ministerial candidate so far
 'shivasena netaa uddhav thakare ne yah bhi likhaa ki bijepi ko apana ummidavaar chunane kaa puraa haq he
 But the current situation is such that the wedding setup is not ready but many of the grooms are ready
 or unamem se kai to iske hakdaar bhi nahin hai
 So sorry: See, how the dream of Modi broke down: Advising Modi, he wrote that Deve Gowda, Chandrasekhar, Rajiv Gandhi and Gujral never dreamed of becoming Prime Minister, but they did
 dow
 Manmohan Singh also never thought of becoming PM
 lekin unhone das saal tak pradhanmantri rahane kaa record bana diya
 In Delhi politics, horses that are out of the race are also winners
 modi ko itihaas se kuch siikhnaa chahie
 It is often the case that after stealing or losing your phone, the thief changes his identity by changing his SIM card or IMI number
 or is vajah se police ko bhi aapke khoe phone ko dhundhane main khaasi dikkat hoti he

 The Center for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) has developed the technology and is expected to roll out in August
 doorsanchaar vibhaag ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki si-dot ke paas praudyogiki taiyaar he
 After the Parliament session, the Department of Telecommunications will contact the Minister to introduce this system
 yah agle maheene lagu honi chahie
 The current session of Parliament will run till 26 July
 doorsanchaar vibhaag ne july, 2017 main nakli mobile phone or chori kii ghatnaon main kami laane ke lakshya ke saath si-dot ko 'central equipment aaidentiti register' (siiaiar) viksit karne kaa kaam diya tha
 The government had allocated an amount of Rs 15 crore for the formation of CEIR
 siiaiar pranali sim card nikaalane yaa iemiai number badale jane ke baavjood chori yaa khoe hue phone par sabhi tarah kii sevaaon ko avaruddha kar degi
 (from input language) is saal holi kaa tyohaar 2 march ko manaaya jayega
 Its preparations are going on in full swing
 holi harsh or ullas kaa tyohaar he or desh ke har kone main dhooma-dham se manaaya jaataa he
 It has been seen many times that we forget to take care of our body amidst the splash of colors
 rangon se khelte vakt hamen apni aakhon kaa vishesh rup se dhyaan rakhane kii jarurat he
 Eyes are very sensitive
 hamen iskaa khaas dhyaan rakhane kii jarurat he
 Especially when playing with colors we need to be careful about our eyes
 kuch tips kii badaulat aap rangon se khelte vakt apni ankhon kaa dhyaan rakh sakate hai
 Such was Sridevi's LIFESTYLE, herself told that first of all the beauty of beauty, you need to take care that people around you do not throw color on you suddenly or with shock
 is dauraan rang kaaphi teji se aapaki aakhon main ghus saktaa he or unhen buree tarah se prabhavit kar saktaa he
 It would be better if you take care and ask them not to apply color in your eyes
 pehle holi ke dauraan phulon se holi khilne kaa rivaaj tha or log rangon se holi kam khelte the
 But with time, colors replaced flowers
 rangon se khelte vakt aakhon or twachaa ko bachaane kii sakht jarurat he
 Instead of playing Holi with toxics, try playing Holi with herbal colors
 in rangon main chemical kii maatra kam hoti he or inase aapaki aakhon ko zyada nuksaan nahin hoga
 Keep men in this way, it will be better than your body to put glasses in your eyes
 ye aapaki ankhon ko puri tarah se dhak legaa or aap bekhauf hokar rangon se khilne kaa majaa le sakenge
 There is no better way to protect your eyes while playing color
 aap apni ankhon ke ird-gird nariyal ke tel kii maalish kar sakate hai
 This will not easily penetrate your eyes and you will be able to protect your eyes
 iske saath holi khelte vakt ankhon main contact lens lagane se bhi bachane kii jarurat he
 It can spoil your eyes

 Afridi is once again eyeing this record

 In ODI International cricket, Afridi hit a century in 37 balls against Sri Lanka and this record could not be broken for 17 years
 ise newjiland ke kori anderson ne todaa
 He did this feat in 36 balls
 lekin dakshin africa ke abi divilliars ne unka record tod diya
 He scored a century in just 31 balls
 unhone isi dauraan sabase tej gati se pachaasa lagane kaa bhi record banaaya
 Afridi has said in an interview that he would like to set a new record when Pakistan's matches are held in New Zealand in the World Cup
 unhone kaha ki agar aisa hota he to yah vanade cricket se vidaa lene ke pehle unke unke liye yaadgaar pal hoga
 Afridi said that such records are not made by planning
 agar vah din aapkaa ho or aapkaa aatmavishvaas hiloren maar rahaa ho to yah to apane aap ho jaataa he
 He said that if everything goes well and i have a special day, i will try to make the record again in New Zealand
 afridi ko is baat kii khushi he ki divilliars jaisaa shandaar ballebaaj sabase tej centuri kaa nayaa record banane main safal hua he
 But Afridi suspects that it may not be possible to make a century in the place where he is batting
 ab wo loar order main batting karte hai or unke liye 50 bananaa to aasaan he lekin centuri kathin
 Afridi will retire from ODI cricket after the World Cup

 6
 vanade cricket main sachin ke naam 96 ardhashatak hai or unka shaayad ye record bhi na tut paae kyonki unke is record ke paas pahunchane vaale sabhi chaaron ballebaaj kumaar sangakaara, jacks kallis, rahul dravid or injamaam ul haq vanade cricket se sanyas le chuke hai

 sachin ne 1998 main vanade main 1894 ran banaae the
 11
 sachin kaa vanade cricket main sabase zyada 18426 ran banane kaa record todna bhi philhal to naammumkin jaisaa hi he
 12
 ekworld kapmen sabase zyada 673 ran banane kaa sachin kaa record bhi aaj tak koi nahin tod paaya
 Master Blaster made this record at the 2003 World Cup
 13
 Sachin's name is also the record for the most 18 nineties in ODI cricket

 In the initial trends of counting of Karnataka assembly elections, BJP is seen to gain 113, while Congress is getting 67 seats
 jedies ko 40 siton par badhat he
 BJP is moving towards majority in Karnataka elections
 aise main visheshgyon kii raay main yah chunaav bijepi ke liye 2019 kii raah aasaan banane main kaaphi sahaayak siddh hoga
 Through the Lingayat cards of Modi Magic and Yeddyurappa, the BJP placed bets in Karnataka
 bijepi ke liye karnataka kii jeet kai myanon main bahut jaruri he
 These results may have far-reaching consequences for the party
 padhein
 1
 mishan 2019 ke aagaaj ke liye ahmakarnataka chunaav nateezon se pehle hi bijepi ne mishan 2019 kii taiyaariyaan shuru kar di thi
 The party gave the slogan of 48 years of Congress versus 48 years of Congress
 gujarat ke mushkil lekin vijayi mukaable ke baad karnataka kii jeet bijepi ke liye 2019 se pehle kisi semifinal se kam nahin hogi
 In the coming times, the BJP is also going to contest the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh
 karnataka ke nattejey yahaan bhi asar daalenge
 PM Modi gave the mantra of 'win polling booth and decide electoral victory' for Karnataka workers
 iske alaava booth management ke liye upi kii tarah amit shah ne karnataka main bhi panna pramukhon kaa prayog aajamaaya
 2
 brands modi par phir jorkarnataka jeetne se bijepi kaa gujarat model congress ke karnataka model ke saamne majboot sabit hoga
 The successful campaign of Brand Modi continued after the bumper victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 20 rajyon main bijepi or sahyogi dalon kii sarkarein hai
 The BJP captured the Left stronghold in the northeastern state of Tripura to form an absolute majority government
 ab brands modi kii pariksha karnataka main he
 In Karnataka, bjp's stake was more on Modi magic than Yeddyurappa, while Congress relied more on Siddaramaiah card than on central leaders
 3
 Opposition will weaken the Congress is an attacker from the time of Gujarat elections and BJP is surrounded by all issues
 karnataka main congress or zyada mukhar hui kyonki is baar vah apane durg main ladaai lard rahi thi
 All opposition parties, including Rahul Gandhi, were unitedly targeting the policies of the Modi government and the BJP was looking only in defense and retaliation
 karnataka main jeet 2019 ke chunavi ran se pehle bijepi ke liye sanjivani sabit ho sakati he
 The party will then be able to face the opposition more clearly on the issues of farmers and Dalits, the Gujarat model of employment and development
 isse party kaaryakartaaon kaa manobal upar hoga
 4
 dakshin bharat par bijepi-sangh kii najar2008 ke chunaav main yediurppa ke chehre ko aage kar bijepi ne karnataka kaa ran jeet dakshin bharat main khaataa kholaa tha
 This time again the party put forward Yeddyurappa's face
 is baar yediurppa card ke saath modi magic kaa bhi jor tha
 The Sangh and BJP have increased their activism in the last few years in South India at the level of organization in view of 2019
 amit shah kaa mishan 120 un dakshini or purvottar ke rajyon kii siton par hi kendrit he jahaan bijepi 2014 main jeet hasil nahin kar saki thi lekin sambhaavnaaen acchhee bani thi
 The election of Karnataka will determine the future of this strategy
 iske baad bijepi tamilnadu, kerala or telugana-hyderabad par focus kar sakegi
 5
 congress mukt bharat kaa naaraa or buland hogabijepi ke congress mukt bharat ke naare ke lihaaj se karnataka ke nattejey kaaphi ahm hai
 Apart from Punjab, Karnataka Congress has a strong stronghold
 karnataka ke nateezon ke asar doorgaami ho sakate hai
 If won, the BJP will enter the upcoming assembly elections and 2019 election campaign with full morale
 tisare morche kii sugabugahat tej hogi or vipakshi foot kaa phayda uthaane kii ranneeti par bijepi kaam karegi

 They are satisfied that the Pakistan Tennis Federation has adopted the security strategy and preparedness according to strict ITF guidelines

 In another letter, AITA has urged the ITF to postpone the Davis Cup tie as it was during the 9 / 11 attack

 itief ne bharat or america ke bich davis cap kaa match sthagit kar diya tha
 AITA says that the Davis Cup tie between India and Pakistan should be postponed by two months in view of the current situation

 Jokes are being sent to the chieftains through sms-like social media sites, but now doing so, you may face trouble and cry instead of laughing
 itnaa hi nahin aap jail bhi ja sakate hai
 One such case has come to light in Jalandhar in which police sending jokes focused on chieftains have been arrested and sent to jail by the police after registering a case under the IT Act and the Indian Penal Code
 jalandhar ke sahaayak police ayukta (pashchim) arpies sandhu ne bataaya, ‘saradaaron par chutkule esemes ke jariye bhejne ke aarope main police ne jalandhar nivasee atul kumaar naamak ek vyakti ke khilaaf maamla darj kar giraftaar kar liya he or jail bhej diya he
 'sandhu told,' Atul sent 15 jokes centered on the chieftains on complainant Narinder Singh's mobile
 iskaa usne virodh kiya lekin atul use lagaataar bhejtaa rahaa
 Meanwhile, despite Narinder's opposition, Atul also sent him an objectionable picture of Asaram
 ’unhone bataaya ki iske baad narinder singh ne atul kumaar ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karwaai
 Police registered the case under the IT Act and Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code, Kumar was arrested and sent to jail
 adhikari ne bataaya ki narinder singh ne apni shikaayat main kaha he ki atul ne saradaaron ke khilaaf chutkule bhej kar sikh bhaawanaaon ko aahat kiya he or uske virodh ke baavjood usne (atul) use or chutkule tathaa asaram kii aapattijanak tasviir bhej di
 Therefore, the police has imposed Section 295A (hurtful religious sentiments) of the Indian Penal Code against Atul
 yah puche jane par ki sardaar par kendrit or santa banta ke chutkule to aam hai to kya maamla darj karnaa or giraftaar tarksangat he is par sandhu ne kaha, ‘police ko agar koi shikayatakarta aa kar dharmik bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne kaa aarope lagaate hue police ko shikaayat detaa he or sakshya pesh kaarta he to police to maamla darj karegi
 Complainant Narinder Singh, on the other hand, said that after Atul received the SMS, he opposed her, but he continued to send and later sent a picture with two girls of Asaram
 iske baad unhone atul ke khilaaf maamla darj karavaaya
 However, Sikh organizations say that this is a better step towards stopping anyone from hurting religious sentiments
 koi bhi chutkula kisi bhi dharm ke khilaaf nahin hona chahie

 It is said that everything is bad, whether it is very bad or very hateful
 phir bhi jab ham kisi madhur rishte main bandha jate hai, to na chaahate hue bhi apane saathi par puraa bharosa kar hi baithte hai

 Keep some special thoughts given below and see your partner with a keen eye
 
 
 unke vyavhaar kaa jayja len
 See if there is any hardness or irritability in your mind for your children
 kahin ve aksar aap par yaa bacchon par gussa to nahin karte
 The husband who is sticking with your house nowadays does not want to see till the face of the house
 ghar aate bhi hai, to unhen baahar jane kii jaldi rahati he
 Are they coming home late at night? ghar aate samay bhi ve yaa to phone par batiyate hai yaa aapse baat na karne ke unke paas duusare bahaane taiyaar hote hai
 Somewhere they have become more aware of their phone
 apane phone ko khud se dur nahin karte or phone kol ke baad yaa massej ke baad unka kaccha chittha mitaane main jute jate hai
 Do they hesitate to talk on the phone in front of you or talk in codeword
 koshish karte hai ki phone jaldi se kaat den or aapaki maujuudagi main phone par baat karte hue haklaate hai
 Have they started keeping their purses very safe since last few days
 kya ve ghar par hote hue bhi aapse nazren churaate hai
 It is not that they go out for a walk outside the house on the pretext of gas or any other problem
 unke vyavhaar par dhyaan den
 Do they reduce your debate these days? aapaki shikayaton kaa koi jawaab nahin dete
 In fact, when a man cheats on a woman, they do not attach themselves to their questions or problems
 aapaki ve baaten jo unhen kisi daur main aapkaa kaayal bana detii thim, ab unke liye koi myne nahin rakhti
 Suddenly they start talking about going with their old friends or they are often out with an old friend, whom you don't know
 kahin achaanak ve mahilaon ke dressing sens ke bare sajag to nahin ho gaye hai
 Now they all know what is in fashion nowadays and how much is it
 aapako maayke jane se rokane vaale aapke patidev achaanak hi aapako apane maayke jane kii salaah dene lagen hai
 If this is the case, then it is time for you to talk to them and ask what is the reason for the changes within them

 In Chhattisgarh, the system of online coaching of PET and PMT to the students of government schools has failed
 haal yah he ki 28 hajaar chaatro ko is system ke madhyam se koching di gai, is par sarkari khajaane se 18 karod rupee kharch ho gaye, lekin ek bhi chaatr ko naa to PMT main sthaan mila or naa hi PET main
 Now academics are raising fingers about this system
 unki daleel he ki sarkari dharre or gaiyr peshewar tareeke se iskaa sanchaalan hone ke chalate chaatro kaa sirf samay barbaad hua he
 The Edusat system and its objective was to develop the system eight years ago in the State Educational Research and Training Council (SCERT) due to the shortage of teachers in PCM ie Physics, Chemistry and Maths in government schools
 iske tahat kareeb 250 skulon ke ek vishesh kamare ko hitech koching room main tabdeel kiya gaya tha
 Projector, computer and internet facility was provided here
 satellite ke jariye chaatro ko PCM kii padhai ke alaava PET or PMT kii koching di jaati thi
 The teacher, principal was paid separately for this coaching
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ek centre par salanaa 6 lakh rupee kharch hote the
 Many centers would be closed after two to four months and then operated to withdraw funds
 prasaaran system dedh saal se thappaishwaishth ke mukhyalay main hi aguset system dedh saal se thapp padaa he
 It is being told that many of its parts were burnt by the short circuit

 Engineers have visited 3-4 times, but the broadcast has not started yet

 Insisting on starting the broadcast soon, he said that talks are on with the officials
 aisa nahin he ki in varsho main sarkari skulon ke koi chaatr PET or PMT main silect nahin hue
 Hundreds of students from government schools won PET and PMT in these years, but they studied in private coaching institutes
 aguset system main un chaatro kii fehrist jamaa he, jinhone yahaan koching lee he
 But in the list of 28 thousand students, not a single student was found to have been selected in PET or PMT
 shikshavid maang kar rahe he ki yah yojana sirf sarkari dhan kaa apvyay ban kar rah gayi he
 At the same time, the students' time is also spoiled
 isse behatar he ki usee rakam se chaatro ko vishesh shikshakon ke jariye koching karai jaae

 Ramai Ram also comes from the Dalit community
 is lihaaj se dekha jaae, to jediu ke bheetar hi dalit siem ke ek se zyada ummidavaar ho gaye hai
 It is worth mentioning that on Thursday, Jitan Ram Manjhi had said that if the people of the state wished, then a Dalit could be the Chief Minister
 maanjhi vivaadaaspad bayaan dekar kai baar apni hi party ke netaaon ko safai dene par majaboor kar chuke hai
 Significantly, the talk of merger of JDU and RJD in Bihar is hot
 khabaren yah bhi hai ki lalu or nitish ke bich guuruuvaar raat mulaakaat hui jisamen nai party or nae siem ko lekar charchaa hui
 In such a situation, the leave of the current CM Manjhi is being considered as fixed
 khabara ke mutabik lalu bhi maanjhi ko hataae jane ke paksh main hai
 On the other hand, while leaving for Delhi on Thursday, former CM Nitish Kumar has given further speculation to this saying that he cannot guarantee to keep Manjhi as the Chief Minister

 But in Bihar, Rahul and Congress are in Bhanwarjal
 yahaan aktubar main chunaav hone hai or rahul, lalu yadav tathaa nitish kumaar ko lekar kashmakash main hai
 If Lalu and Nitish do not have an alliance, Rahul is struggling with the question of who the Congress will go with
 unke paas teesraa vikalp he ki kya long turm vaapasi ke liye akele chunaav ladaa jaae
 Rahul is confused because on the one hand party workers, especially the youth, want the Congress to fight alone for a long term withdrawal
 inkaa kahana he ki lagaataar gathbandhan main rahane kii vajah se congress ko ghaataa hua he
 On the other hand the state party leaders want to combine on the back of lalu-nitish in the hope of winning their seats
 inkaa kahana he ki bihar main bijepi kii haar se deshbhar main vipaksh kii vaapasi hogi or modi kaa rashtriya lahar khatm hoga
 And this is possible only when Congress makes alliance with secular parties in Bihar assembly elections
 iske alaava congress kaa chunavi itihaas bhi bura he
 In the last Bihar assembly election of 2010, she won only four seats out of 243 seats
 pichley maukon kii tarah loksabhaa chunaavon main bhi sonia gandhi ke netritv main congress ne nitish kii bajaae lalu ko chunaa tha
 Despite this, Rahul Gandhi had shown greater trust in Nitish at that time
 rahul kii pasand maane jane vaale bihar congress adhyaksh ashok choudhary ne khule taur par nitish ko rajya main secular gathbandhan kaa netritv saunpe jane kaa prastaav diya he
 But personally the state Congress leaders still consider Lalu more reliable and it will also be easier to compromise with Lalu after getting caught in the fodder scam

 The people of Jammu and Kashmir have expressed their desire by participating in free and fair elections to be held at regular intervals
 andrabi ne kaha ki bhartiya rajanyik ne apni pratikriya main kuch atarksangat daawey kiye
 He said that there are several resolutions of the Security Council in which Jammu and Kashmir has been considered as a disputed area
 unhone kaha ki in prastaavon main kaha gaya ki jammu kashmir kaa antim hal sanyukt raashtra kii maujuudagi main logon dwaara swatantra or nishpaksh janamat sangrah ke mutabik hoga
 Andrabi said that these resolutions clearly state that no elections held by India in Jammu and Kashmir can replace the free and fair referendum held in the presence of the United Nations
 pakistani rajanyik ne kaha, suraksha parishad ke kai prastaavon main jammu kashmir ke logon ke aatmanirnay ke adhikaar ko sweekaar kiya gaya 
 Preventing the people of Jammu and Kashmir from self-determination for the last 63 years is very relevant in our discussion

 Akhilesh Yadav humbly laughs at the media being the new choice, 'after six months of hard work, it seems that now i have gone to Delhi
 ’ ve avadh ke dusarerajakumaar banakar ubhare hai
 The election in Uttar Pradesh has gone more than half way and with the rise of the Samajwadi Party (SP) hinting, people have started showing interest in this new branded Netaji
 november, 2011 main chunaav-purv surveykshanon main yah baat saamne ai thi ki bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ko satta virdohi lahar kaa saamana karnaa padegaa, lekin tab koi nahin kah saktaa tha ki is khaali ho rahi jagah par koun kabiz hoga
 See detailed coverage on the UP election at that time, the Congress had made political stakes to make Rahul Gandhi and his mission Uttar Pradesh successful in a planned manner
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main rajya se 21 congressi saansad jeetne ke baad party kii ummiden bad gai thim
 To capitalize on this success, Rahul had meticulously designed his political tours in which special packages from the Center were included
 iske thik ulat buudhe hote netritv or aadhuniktaa virdohi kai kadamon se sapa kii qamar jhuk chuki thi
 The anti-computer policy, the stereotypical commitment to English abolition and the mindset of avoiding machines had almost decided that the resurgence of the party was not possible in any way
 iske samanaantar akhilesh sapa kii chhavi badalane ke liye baraabar kaam kar rahe the
 Even they were going among the public with the latest model cycle
 party ke ghoshnaptr main chaatro ko muft laptop kaa vaada kiya gaya
 Computers were installed in the party office
 akhilesh ke in kadamon par kuch puraane kism ke netaa lagaataar naak-bhun sikod rahe the, ‘kya party ab computer se chalegi?’ akhilesh ne ansuna karte hue bahubaliyon kii bajaae is baar peshewaron ko tikat baanta
 Bahubali d
 pi
 By refusing to give tickets to Yadav, he ignored his uncle Shivpal Yadav
 in kadamon se put ke paanv paalane main hi dikhne lage the
 Then as soon as the election campaign started, Akhilesh started getting positive reactions
 chunaavon par najar rakhane waalon ke aashcharya kii seemaa na rahi jab prachaar ke dauraan akhilesh uttar pradesh kaa aadhunik cheharaa banakar ubhare or unhone us jagah par kabja kar liya jis par ab tak keval rahul gandhi hi najar aa rahe the
 After two rounds of voting, it seemed as if Akhilesh had really stuck in the way of improving the condition of the Congress
 iske asar ke taur par teen baaten ginai ja sakati hai
 First, Rahul said that he would not support SP
 duusari, congress ne yah bhaanpate hue ki uski mutthi se muslim vot phisal rahe hai, akhilesh par sidhaa hamalaa shuru kar diya
 Third, Congress leader Digvijay Singh said that if the Congress could not form a government in the state, they would give priority to President's rule
 isaki pratikriya main akhilesh rahul kaa jawaab dene main or mukhar ho gaye
 The rise of this SP prince is amazing in the fact that his wife Dimple was defeated by Raj Babbar from Firozabad seat in the 2009 Lok Sabha by-election
 sapa ke vafaadaar rahe babbar ab rahul ke bharosemand hai
 This defeat gave Akhilesh a chance to find the pulse of the public
 unhone party kii chhavi ke bare main kai surveykshan karwaae
 Says a party MLA, 'there was an atmosphere of anger against the BSP but at the same time there was a fear that if SP returned, Gundaraj would prevail
 ’ iske baad akhilesh ko ehsaas hua ki ve na sirf jamini ladaai, balki soch ke str par bhi ladaai lard rahe hai
 For the first time in the history of SP, interested candidates were asked to fill the application form
 akhilesh bataate hai, ‘pichley saal kii shuruyaat main hamane chayan prakriya aarambh kii
 i got 4,000 to 5,000 applications
 ’ iske baad akhilesh, unke chachaa ramgopal yadav or party ke anya varisht netaaon ne aavedakon kaa intervyuu liya
 He explains, 'we asked him how he would raise the issues and how much he hoped for his victory
 iske baad yah list netaji ko bheji gai jinhone antim nirnay liya
 The party's election campaign started by Akhilesh on a 250-km cycle tour in September 2011 to carry the party's election symbol among the people and mobilize the youth
 barason se chunaav chinh bani rahi cycle ko unhone ek nayaa arth or naam diya-ummid kii cycle
 He explains, 'we wanted our election campaign not to go among the people with negative thoughts, but to create hope
 ’ unke saathi bataate hai ki unhone pichley chunaavon main partiyon ke prachaar kaa kaaphi adhyayan kiya tha or khaskar 2004 main rajg ke naare 'bhay ho' kii aalochana kii thi, jo upie ke naare 'jai ho' ke jawaab main bana tha
 There is a lot of similarity between Akhilesh's style of promotion and Rahul's methods
 donon hi peshewaron or party kaaryakartaaon kii madad se apana prachaar karte hai
 Both are tech savvy and are also similar in development
 jab congress ne 2008 main parmaanu saude par sapa se samarthan maanga tha, to akhilesh ne rahul se devaria ke peedblyoody guest house main mulaakaat kii thi
 The relationship between the two was quite cordial then
 donon hi videsh main padhe hai
 Rahul studied development economics from Cambridge University in London, while Akhilesh did Environmental Engineering from Sydney, although M
K
 tech kii padhai unhone ab tak puri nahin kii he
 At first, Dimple came from the Thakur family, with whom he married love and soon after that started on the political path
 bas yaheen aakar donon kii raahen juda ho jaati hai
 a man who runs a tea shop in Pratapgarh says, "when Rahul speaks on the problem of farmers, then he seems to be repeating the teachings
" jab akhilesh bolte hai to aisa lagata he ki unhen samasya kii jaankaree he
 Akhilesh speaks the common language, Rahul still has a child
 ’rahul apane prachaar main rashtriya or kshetreey, donon muddon ko uthaate hai jabaki akhilesh khud ko sthaneey muddon tak hi simit rakhte hai
 Congress leader Surendra Rajput of Lucknow says, 'rahulji is a national leader, while Akhilesh is a regional leader
 akhilesh hamaare netaa ke gutka (pocket) sanskaran hai
 'also add that' Gutka versions are always sold more
 ’congress ke mukaable sapa ke rajkumaar kii raahen isliye or bhi aasaan dikhti hai kyonki unki party main unka samarthan karne vaala kader maujuud he
 They remain natural and normal in the crowd
 sitambar se janvari ke bich 215 vidhansabha kshetron main jab ve kranti rathyatra lekar nikle the, to 9,000 kimi ke is safar main ve lagaataar logon se baatcheet kar rahe the, chaahe unke haath bheed ke abhivadan main hilte rahe hon yaa phir blueberi par massej tip kar rahe hon
 During this journey, he got stuck in a jam in Barabanki
 unke bagal main ek trek driver unhen dekh kar chaunkaa tha
 He shook hands and said to him, 'hello truck driver Bhaiya' and asked him his name - village
 apane bagal main baithe vyakti se unhone fusfusa kar kaha, ‘vah shartiya kannauj kaa hoga’ (kannauj akhilesh kaa chunaav kshetra he)
 Then when the father and son meet, what to say
 ek ore mulaayam singh mayawati par hamale kar rahe hai to akhilesh rahul kii yuva chhavi ko chunauti de rahe hai
 But Akhilesh understands that the party's top leaders accept him only because he has his father behind him
 mysore uniwarsity se snaatak samaajwaadiyon kii agali peedi kaa yah nayak bhale farrotedaar angreji bolta ho, lekin hameshaa hindi ko hi tarjeeh detaa he
 When anchors ask him questions in English on English news channels, they still answer in Hindi
 har koi achche vichaaron kaa shrey hadapney kii koshish karata he
 Former SP leader Amar Singh says, 'I had suggested that Akhilesh be made the president of the state unit to change the anti-english and anti-computer image of the party
 ‘ ve kehete hai, ‘ladkaa acha he haalanki usamen focus kii kami he
 'even a few years ago, Mulayam would have believed his old friend, when football lover Akhilesh was more comfortable talking on Manchester United than talking on caste equations
 lekin tab se ab tak chijen bahut badal chuki hai
 Now Mulayam's son is not allowed to sit in the back of a bicycle
 aaj vah vakt kaa pahiyaa palatney kii kavayad main juta he

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently started a campaign to find out who is the person in his office who is sending inside information to former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav
 darasal, 16 may ko yogi kii mulaakaat sapa ke ek varisht netaa se hui, jinhone yogi se akhilesh yadav ke 4 or 5, vikramaditya maarg ke bangalon ko sapa ke do varisht netaaon ke naam aavantit karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Yogi was surprised to hear this because the Department of Real Estate had received a directive from the Supreme Court to vacate the government bungalows given to the former Chief Ministers a day before and the department had not even been able to issue a notice in this regard

 Shahid Kapoor's 'udta Punjab' is stuck in the censor
 punjab main drugs ke halaat ko lekar bani is film ko film sensor board ne dheron gaaliyaan hone kii vajah se kuch cat sujhaaye the
 He had objections to these abuses and was asked to tone down one or two scenes
 film ko abhishek choube ne diarect kiya he or shahid ke alaava aalia bhatta, dilajit dusanjh or karina kapur khan bhi hai
 Where is the mess, although it is being said in the news that there was a difference of opinion among the members of the Board of Kissancer
 jabaki aisa nahin he
 If sources are to be believed, the film was watched by four members and an RO
 film main gaaliyon kaa jabardast istemaal he or board ke sadasyon ne 70 se lekar 100 gaaliyon tak ke aankade die or inhen hataane ke liye kaha tha
 The board is unanimous in the removal of abuses, but the difference is only about the number of them
 sutara bataate hai ki film ko lekar diference of opinian katai nahin he, diference sirf gaaliyon kii sankhya ko lekar hi he
 Not only this, there is a song in the film in which the druggies have been glorified and there is also a murder scene which is advised to tone down
 yuvaaon kii bhashaa kaa diya tarksutron ne bataaya ki udata punjab main chu # $& # , haraa # ja # , gaan # , maad # $ # ! # , pha$, gash$&, lu$ # ! or bahan # $$ jaisi gaaliyon kii bharmaar he, haalanki film se judi team kaa tark he ki film main punjab ke yuvaaon kii bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 Because of which there is such language
 iske alaava, sensor ne shahid kapur ke darshakon par peshaab karne ke seen par bhi aapatti jataai he
 However, sources say that the film has also shown many such things about the drug business in Punjab, which undermines the image of the needless

 kejariwal ne kaha ki bijepi ke netritv vaali sarkaar aam aadmi party ke achche kaaryon se pareshaan ho gai he
 Kejriwal said in the press conference, 'the bjp-led central government has issued the notification because they are upset with the good work done by the AAP government

 Eyes are the most important part of our body
 ankhen hi hamaare jivan main roshni bharti hai
 Life cannot be imagined without eyes
 lekin aajkal kii lifestil main computer, tivi, mobile phone kaa bahut zyada istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Because of which our eyes are having a very bad effect
 itnaa hi nahin, aajkal ke badhate pradooshan or jahrili hawaaon ke kaaran bhi ankhon main jalan, chubhan, ankhon kaa laal hona, ankhon se pani aane kii samasya bhi kaaphi aam ho gai hai
 In this case, it is very important to take special care of your eyes
 ham aapako kuch khaas upaay bataa rahen hai jo aapaki ankhon kii pareshaani ko dur karne main madad karenge
 1
 khan-paan par dhyaan den:khaanaa sirf pet bharne ke liye nahin khaaya jaataa, balki aapke sharir komajboot banane or energy deneke liye khaaya jaataa he
 Therefore, as much as possible, include such things in your food in which protein is present in plenty
 jaise ki paalak, gaajar, anda, machhlee aadi
 Many eye problems disappear with the consumption of these things
 2
 Give technology a little break: Watching more computers, mobile phones or TV can irritate the muscles of the eyes
 isse ankhon main khushki bhi aati he
 Therefore, to keep eyes healthy, use as little technology as possible
 3
 Exercise the eyes: To avoid eye light and other problems, it is important that you do regular eye exercises
 hafte main kam se kam 25-30 minute tak eksrasij karne se ankhon ki kai samasyaon se bachaa ja saktaa he
 4
 palken jarur jhapakaaen:computer, mobile yaa tivi kaa istemaal karte samay bich-bich main palken jarur jhapakaaen
 By doing this, the eyes do not get inflamed as well as it does not cause much strain on the eyes
 5
 Do not work in low light: Reading in low light or watching TV has very bad effect on the eyes
 ankhon par zyada strain padane ke kaaran ankhen jaldi thakaan mahasoos karne lagati hai
 This also affects the eyesight
 isliye jitna ho sake kam roshni main kaam karne se bachein

 There was a battle over domination in the committee of the mosque here, in which lathi-sticks and stones went up
 video dekhakar lag rahaa tha maano koi yuddh chal rahaa he
 Looking at this video made from the roof of the house, it seems that both sides are intent on killing each other
 is dauraan kareeb do darjan se zyada log aapas main bhid gaye or ek- duusare ko dauda- daudakar peeta or jamkar ek duusare par laat-ghunse or lathi danda barasaaye
 How fierce this battle was between the two sides can be gauged from the fact that the firing took place here
 donon guton ke log ek duusare par pathar hi nahin balki cold drink kii kaanch kii botalon se bhi is duusare par hamalaa kar rahe the
 The people of the Masjid Committee believe that these people are of a criminal type and harass Namaji, Moazzin and Imam
 cameti main donon pakshon ke logon ne juluus nikaala
 After this, the Imam praised one side, due to which the angry people of other side not only abused the Imam but also threatened to throw acid on him

 DMK has protested against the order of Southern Railway, in which the Railways had said that only Hindi and English language should be used during the conversation between the Control Room and the Station Master
 railway ke is aadesh kaa diemke netaaon ne virodh kiya he
 DMK leaders met Southern Railway officials and expressed their opposition
 diemke netaaon ke virodh ke baad railway ne safai dete hue kaha he ki aisa aadesh dene kaa makasad sirf ye tha ki bhashaa kii vajah se baatcheet ke dauraan kisi tarah kii pareshaani na ho
 What was the circular issued by the circular railway, it was said that the station masters should talk to the control office only in English or Hindi
 kisi bhi kshetreey bhashaa kaa istemaal karne se bachaa janaa chahie, taaki kisi bhi paksh ko samaj nahin aane kii sthiti se bachaa ja sake
 The circular was changed after the protest
 The Southern Railway had said that the purpose of this circular is to improve the connectivity between the control office and the station masters

 The Modi government is fully committed to getting Muslim women out of triple talaq
 guuruuvaar ko ek baar phir loksabhaa main 'muslim mahila vivaah adhikaar sangrakshan vidheyak-2018' par charchaa ho sakati he
 The government and the opposition agreed to discuss the bill in the House last week
 bijepi or congress ne loksabhaa ke apane sadasyon ko vip jari karke charchaa ke dauraan sadan main upasthit rahane ke liye kaha chuki hai
 Significantly, the Modi government had brought the triple talaq bill last year, the bill was also passed after discussion in the Lok Sabha
 lekin congress sahit kuch vipakshi dalon ke virodh ke chalate vah bill rajyasabha main paas nahin ho paaya tha
 The Modi government has brought the Muslim Women Marriage Protection Protection Bill-2018 for the second time, with three important amendments, to ban the rights of married Muslim women and their husbands to divorce by saying 'divorce, divorce, divorce' at once
 sarkaar is vidheyak ko pichley hafte paas karana chaahati thi, lekin congress or anya vipakshi partiyon dwaara rafel saude par sanyukt sansadeey samiti (jepisi) se jaanch samet anya maangon ko lekar hue hangaame ke chalate bill par charchaa nahin ho saki thi
 What are the three changes before the first amendment - in this case, anyone could have filed a case earlier
 itnaa hi nahin police sangyaan lekar maamla darj kar sakati thi
 Now after the amendment - now the victim, close relatives will be able to register the case

 ab sanshodhan ke baad-magistrate ke saamne pati-patni main samjhaute kaa vikalp bhi khulaa rahegaa
 The state has a total of 48 Lok Sabha seats
 congress or rakanpa ke bich ab tak ahmednagar, nandurbaar, raver, jaalnaa, aurangabad or ratnagiri-sindhudurg par koi samjhauta nahin hua he
 In these seats, NCP has traditionally contested on Raver and Ahmednagar
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi or rakanpa pramukh sharad pavaar ke bich vaarta ke baad rakanpa ne pune or yavatmal-washim siton par apana daawa chhod diya he
 Sources said that Congress is likely to contest 26 seats while NCP will contest 22 seats

 Party sources said that the list of candidates from Marathwada, North Maharashtra, West Maharashtra is expected to be finalized by the Parliamentary Board on Tuesday
 unhone bataaya ki vidarbha or mumbai ke liye 30 janvari ko yah prakriya kii jaaegi
 On the other hand, the efforts of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra seem to be paying off
 loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi-shivasena ek baar phir saath aate dikh rahe hai
 If sources are to be believed, on the lines of Bihar, BJP has agreed to bow before Shiv Sena in Maharashtra
 dono main 24-24 siton par baat banati dikh rahi he
 It is a different matter that Shiv Sena is still refusing any such proposal

 ' loksabhaa main avishvaas prastaav par bahes ke dauraan congress adhyaksh ke kai rang dekhne ko mili
 Sometimes Rahul Gandhi was seen as an attacker on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sometimes he thanked the PM for changing himself and the Congress
 rahul gandhi kaa yah alag andaaj aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main congress kii ranneetik taiyaariyon kii jhalak bhi de gaya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi was accused in recent days of meeting Muslim intellectuals that he has said that Congress is a party of Muslims
 haalanki congress kii taraf se ise lekar safai di ja chuki he
 But Rahul Gandhi thought it appropriate to answer this charge on the floor of the House
 rahul gandhi ke bhaashan ke dauraan jab sadan main 10 minute ke sthagan ke baad dobaaraa bahes shuru hui tab rahul gandhi ne tregeri bench kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki 'aap log soch rahe honge ki mere dil me piem ke khilaaf gussa, krodh or nafrat he
 But i say that i am grateful to PM, BJP, RSS that they taught me the meaning of Congress
 iske liye dhanyavad ki aapane mujhe dharm, shiv ji or hindu hone kaa matlab samajhaayaa
 In fact, after the drastic defeat in the 2014 elections, the most important fact revealed in the report of the Antony Committee set up by the Congress was that people have come to know the Congress as a party of Muslims
 antni cameti kii is report ke baad ab tak dharm ko nijee vishay bataane vaale congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi bhi dharm ko lekar pratispardhi raajnneeti karte hue dikhe
 Let me tell you that after walking on Kedar Nath, Rahul Gandhi visited Baba Kedar after wearing the tripund and leaving the temple and said that he got tremendous power by seeing Shiva
 gujarat chunaavon ke dauraan bhi rahul gandhi ne somnath ke darshan kiye tilak, tripund or janeu sareekhe hindu pratikon ke saath unki tasviren prasaarit kii gayi
 Even during the Karnataka elections, Rahul was seen circling various monasteries and temples
 rahul gandhi se jab bhi is bare main poocha gaya ki ve achaanak mandiron or mathon kaa darshan kyon kar rahe hai tab unhone jawaab diya ki vah aisa pehle bhi karte aae hai
 If they are called to a religious place, they will keep going there until the society is divided by their going there
 darasal dharm ko apane vastron par dhaaran karnaa pradhanmantri narendra modi or bhaajapa ke netaaon kaa purana shagal rahaa he
 The Congress, which claims to be a secular party, has avoided such appearances
 jisaki vajah se dharmbhiru hindu vot congress kii taraf se khisakta gaya or bijepi se jud gaya
 Now the strategy of Congress is to put this vote bank once again in its camp
 vahiin congress kii chhavi bijepi ke tathakthith dharmonmad se itar ek samaveshi hindu party banane kii he
 Rahul Gandhi has also pointed to the BJP in the Lok Sabha and said that 'your (treasury Bench) is angry with me, i can be Pappu for you, you can abuse me differently
 lekin mere man main aapke liye nafrat nahin he'
 i will not hold so much anger and anger against you
 iskaa kaaran he ki main congress hum
 i will remove the feeling of hate
 ek-ek karke main sabake andar se gussa nikaaloongaa
 Will include everyone in Congress'
 rahul gandhi jab congress ke upaadhyaksh bane the tab apane bhaashan ke dauraan unhone kaha tha ki unki maa (sonia gandhi) ne unase kaha he ki satta jehar he
 So is Rahul Gandhi, the vice president-turned-congress president, ready to call this poison of hatred like Neelkanth Shiva? mukhyamantri ne bhavantar bhugtan yojana main fasal ke mulya nirdhaaran kii prakriya kii jaankaree dete hue bataaya ki aath fasalon main se kisi fasal kaa mandi main nirdhaarit avadhi ke dauraan vikray nunatam samarthan mulya se kam or mandal vikray dar se adhik par hota he, to vikray kii dar tathaa nunatam samarthan mulya ke bich ke antar kii raashi kisaan ke khate main jamaa kii jaaegi

 It was a hot afternoon in Nagpur
 saint jevirs college se padhe activist arun ferera stesan par kisi saathi kaa intjaar kar rahe the
 Then they were surrounded by 15 people and got hit by a car and took them away
 raste main unhen maaraa-peeta gaya or baad main bataaya gaya ki nagpur kii anti naksal cell ne unhen ditten kar liya he
 The other day the important news of the newspapers of the country was- 'big Naxalite of the country arrested
 'arun par pratibandhit communist party of india (maoist) kaa member hone samet kul 10 aarope lagaae gaye
 He came out of jail on bail after being in jail for a full 4 years and 8 months
 jamaanat ke do saal baad tak un par koi bhi aarope siddh nahin ho sakaa or antat: unhen har maamle main bari kar diya gaya
 Now they are outside, but how normal is life, ask them only
 jisaki umr ke 4 saal 8 maheene jail main kharch ho gaye, vah bhi anda cell main bhayaavah torchar, gaali-galouj or dhime trial kii tapish jhelte hue, vah ab kitna saamaanya hoga, pataa nahin
 Arun used books to spend time in jail and expanded the old hobby of sketching
 salaakhon ke peeche se hi unhone human ritis kii padhai kii
 Struggled to read and earn even while living there
 baahar aane ke kuch samay baad unhone un scachon ke istemaal se ek kitaab likhi- 'colors of da kej'
 In this book published by the Aleph Book Company, he has detailed his activism, arrest, torture, arrest from the arrest immediately after getting the bail, and the journey to the spotless
 yah ek kaidi kii aam jail diary nahin he
 The police is also a strong document questioning the modalities and judicial system
 salaakhon kaa rang kaisaa hota he, yah ferera jaanate he
 We tried to know from him, about his life, about India's jails and his opinion on the judicial system
 padhie unase hui baatcheet:4 saal 8 maheene jail main rahane or phir sabhi maamalon main bari hone ke baad aapkaa desh ke jeudiciri system main kitna vishwaas bachaa he?ferera:main nahin jaanata hum ki 'vishwaas' shabd kaa upyog iske liye karnaa sahi rahegaa
 The truth is that even though i remained in jail for a long time, i was freed from all charges and was released
 vahiin kai cese aise hai jahaan police ne jhuthe aadhaar par cese ko frem bhi kiya he, jaisaa ki binayak sen or seemaa aaazaad ke cese main hua
 These people managed to get their trial run fast and get bail quickly but they were also convicted
 main is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin de saktaa ki meraa vishwaas jeudiciri main he yaa nahin
 Better than this i would like to say that this system does not give justice
 aapaki raay main nyaay kya he?ferera:yah ek bada sawaal he
 i do not see justice in Criminal Justice Sense
 main nyaay ko saamaajik nyaay ke rup main dekhtaa hum
 The general concept of equality has no meaning in a heavily unequal society
 zyaadaatar anyaay dhani yaa taqatvar corporate log hi karte hai, lekin yah anyaay kisi ko nahin dikhataa
 Till the injustice done by the rich and the powerful is not recognized, the poor and the weak will not get justice
 yahaan tak ki jab vanchit tabake main se koi system ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaata he to use pakadakar jail main daal diya jaataa he
 You have written in your book that even after getting out of jail, you will be afraid that 'big Brother is watching you'
 aisa kuch aapke saath abhi ho rahaa he kya?ferera:jab main bel par baahar aayaa tab mujhe har din local police se baat kerani hoti thi
 This is a common thing
 lekin mere sabhi keson se bari hone ke baad aisi ('big brother ij watching you' ke sambandh main) koi ghatana nahin ghati he
 Police and intelligence agencies do inquire with such people, whom i meet during my activism
 yahaan tak ki main jis sanghathan se judaa hum, uski bhi jaanch-padtaal kii jaati he
 Does the police discriminate between the accused and other accused of Naxal activities in jail? What is the difference between the way police work and the way they ask questions? Do you think the police have enacted their 'unwritten' laws for torturing? Ferreira: In India, torturing during police custody is a common practice
 haalanki kanoon main is shabd kaa kahin bhi zikr nahin he, phir bhi hamaare desh main ise manyata mili hui he
 This means that the policemen have the support of the entire department and senior officers
 saadhaaran kaidiyon ko saboot nikalwane ke liye torchar kiya jaataa he, jaise 'jis hathiyaar se tumne maaraa, use kahaan chupaaya he'
 But those who are charged with political prisoners or terrorism are tortured for the purpose of punishing, silencing their society and discriminating
 jaisaa ki muslim aropiyon ke saath hota he
 i believe that police are trained on methods of torturing internally
 yahaan tak ki isamen videshi agency jaise ki siie or mosaad se bhi madad lee jaati hogi
 The soldiers of the country are also killed in Naxalite attacks
 aap in hamalon ko kis tarah dekhte hai?ferera:main kisi tarah kii pratihinsa ko justiphi nahin karata hum
 i believe that such violence is a response to the violence done by the state
 kya aapako lagata he ki mulk or maharashtra (jahaan kii jail main aap the) main, bijepi kii sarkaar banane ke baad shashan vyavastha behatar hui he?ferera:pehle se bilkul bhi acchhee nahin hui he, balki kharaab ho gai he
 Both the central and state governments have failed to prevent communal riots, but are trying to cover up such cases
 kya aapane jail main hi kitaab likhane kaa faisla kar liya tha, jaisaa ki aapane scaches kii madad se jail kii jindagi ke pahaluon ko bayaan kiya he?ferera:nahin, main jail main timopas or hobbi ke lihaaj se scaching karata tha
 While in jail, i thought about getting my sketch published, but the idea of writing a book about my prisoner life was not in my mind
 kya aap abhi bhi pichde, vanchit, dalit or adivasee logon ke liye kaam kar rahe hai yaa aap aaropee naksaliyon ke cese ko bhi dekh rahe hai
 Ferreira: My activism continues in Mumbai city
 makasad yahi he ki vanchiton kii madad kii jaae
 Most of the disadvantaged people in this country are poor, Dalits and minorities
 to haa main apana kaam jari rakhe hue hum or haa main naksali hone ke aarope main jail main band kaidiyon ko kanoonee tareeke se jail se baahar nikaalane main bhi madad kar rahaa hum
 While writing this book you would have had to go through all those things again, how difficult was it for you to come out of jail and start your life back? Ferreira: Yes, i had to go through all those experiences in the meantime
 lekin yah acha tha or isane sachai se jodne main madad bhi kiya
 After being in jail for five years and coming back to society, many adjustments have to be made in life
 jindagi ko patari par laane main kuch samay lagata he
 i think this will continue, i have written about it in the last chapter of my book
 jail ke anubhav ke aadhaar par kya aap yah maanate hai ki jail main rahane se kaidi badal jate hai?ferera:haa, ek kaidi jail main jarur badalata he
 But this change is not such that a person can improve by going to jail and he becomes a better person than before
 balki yah badlaav aisa he ki jail jaakar insaan state se zyada dar jaataa he yaa vah yah sikh letaa he ki krime karke bina pakad main aae, kanoon kii giraft se kaise bachaa ja saktaa he
 That is, the fear of the law ends from within

 taapasi pannu bollywood kii shandaar actress main se ek hai
 The reason for this is the absence of Taapsee in both real and reel life
 taapasi pannu kai baar ahm muddon par soshal media par apni raay rakhti hai lekin somvaar ko taapasi ne hatya kii ghatana par aisa twit kiya ki unke phens behad naaraaz najar aae
 Many female fans instructed them to be ashamed
 darasal taapasi pannu ne 15 july ko ek news portal kii khabar ko ritvit karte hue likhaa, 'kya pataa wo ek-duusare se paaglon kii tarah pyaar karte hon or aisa karnaa uske sachche pyaar ko maanya karnaa tha
 Taapsee tweeted the news of the incident that she had committed to killing her 19-year-old girlfriend of a boyfriend in Nagpur, Maharashtra
 ladke ne ladki ko isliye maaraa kyonki use uske kairactor par shaq tha
 Taapsee's tweet was clearly indicating that he has taunted the film Kabir Singh's director Sandeep Vanga
 kyonki beete dinon unhone kabir singh ko dephend karte hue kaha tha wo pyaar hi kya jisamen thappad maarane kii aazaadee nahin ho
 Sandeep's statement was criticized all around, he also clarified it
 lekin sandip wanga ke baad taapasi kaa is tarah ek gambhir murder kii ghatana par twit karnaa yugers ko pasand nahin aayaa
 Tapsi was trolled heavily on social media
 iske baad safai dete hue taapasi ne kaha ki chetavanee: jin logon ke paas vyangy kii samaj nahin he, wo plis meraa twit ignor kariye
 thank you
 ’taapasi ke duusare twit ke baad to unke saporter bhi bhadak gaye

 Has the Congress become a villain on GST
 desh ek gambhir daur se guzar rahaa he
 a tax system is being replaced by a new tax system
 puraani pranali kii tarah nai pranali kaa makasad bhi sirf tex vasuulne kaa he
 In such a situation, why is the central government celebrating it as a celebration of independence? This question has been asked by Congress leader Manish Tiwari on the platform of GST Midnight Conclave with Modi government
 vahiin modi sarkaar ne daawa kiya he ki jiesti se naye bharat kaa udai hoga
 Taking the help of the tweeter, the central government has said that it is hopeful that GST will benefit the country's economy in the coming days
 sarkaar ne daawa kiya he ki jiesti se ye badlaav dekhne ko milenge
 # gstfornewindia Why was GST important? Modi government has clarified why it has decided to implement GST immediately
 sarkaar ke mutabik jiesti lagu hone ke baad 5 ahm1
 To make the whole country an integrated market (common National Market)
 2
 GST will be applicable, easy and digital to pay business tax to remove VAT drawbacks
 3
 GST will introduce uniform tax rate regime across the country
 4
 GST will reduce taxes on the product and services in the country, so that goods can be sold in the market at cheaper rates
 5
 To increase the government's earnings by expanding the tax structure in the country and collecting digital data of the business to prevent tax evasion
 kendra sarkaar ke mutabik jiesti se hone vaale in badlaavon se nae bharat kaa udai hoga
 Prime Minister Modi has already spoken about New India
 vahiin manish tiwari ne sawaal uthaaya he ki sarkaar jiesti ke baad kaarobaar main hone vaale badlaav ke chalate ekatra hone vaale nae aankadon kii suraksha ke liye puri tarah taiyaar he?shiksha-swasthya GST se bahrakendra sarkaar ne aam aadmi ke liye in do ahm sevaaon ko jiesti ke daayre se baahar rakhaa he
 The government will not levy tax on both these services
 lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki jiesti lagu hone ke baad desh main shiksha or swasthya sevaayen mahangi nahin hongi
 Both of these services need major improvements in India
 jahaan kendra sarkaar kii koshish desh main shiksha ke str main sudhaar karne kii chunauti he vahiin use desh kii badahaal swasthya seva ko majboot karne kii kavayad kerani he
 Therefore, along with the need for large investment in these two areas, these areas also need to be handed over to the market
 aise main jiesti lagu hone ke baad donon kshetron main kaarobaariyon kii laagat main ijaphe kii ummid he
 In such a situation, better education and health services can be expensive in the country
 shiksha or swasthya sevaayen mahangi?tex sudhaar kaa asar shiksha or swasthya kshetra main kaarobaar kar rahi companiyon par padegaa
 Companies making medicine along with paper, books, computers etc
 for school, as well as X-rays and other machines in the hospital will be taxed
 lihaaja, in kshetron main keemton main ijaphe se skool main shiksha or aspataal main ilaaj karana mahangaa ho jayega
 Therefore, apart from the answer to Manish Tiwari's question, the Modi government must also clarify whether education and health sector also needs the biggest reforms in the country? If the government wants to collect more and more taxes and education and health will become more expensive in the coming days, will there be excellent health services along with excellent education in the country? For the common man, New India can rise through better education and health services

 Born in Kankhal in the religious city of Haridwar, Satpal Maharaj's real name is Satpal Singh Rawat
 lekin aadhyatmik guru ke taur par apni pahchaan banane ke baad unako satpal maharaj ke taur par hi janaa jaataa he
 There is another face in the BJP which is also considered close to the Sangh
 sutron ke mutabik agar uttarakhand main sangh kaa dakhal rahaa to trivendra ravat ko rajya kaa aglaa mukhyamantri banaaya ja saktaa he
 Not only this, he is considered close to BJP President Amit Shah

 Trivendra Rawat won from Doiwala seat
 unhone congress ke varisht netaa hira singh bisht ko haraaya he
 Rawat's image is also impeccable, so it is believed that BJP may give him a chance so that a strong government can be formed in the state

 Satpal Maharaj's father Yogi Raj Parmasant Shri Hans ji Maharaj and mother Jagat Janani Rajeshwari Devi were also Dharma Gurus
 lekin satpal maharaj kaa lagaav raajnneeti se bhi rahaa he
 He continued to be associated with the Congress and also worked as the Minister of State for Railways in the Congress Government of the Center in 1991
 lekin philhal bijepi ke saath hai
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections 2014, Satpal Maharaj joined BJP

 Talking about this till date, BJP MP Bhagat Singh Kashyori opposed the appointment of Satpal Maharaj as the Chief Minister in a gesture

 The Communist Party of India has become the first political party to respond to an RTI application after the Central Information Commission has declared political parties as public authorities under an order but has said that it does not fall under the RTI Act

 In response to Agarwal's question, the CPI said that it is in favor of transparency in the income of political parties and has also given such information to the CIC

 i would like to remind all of you that Kulkarni has been a BJP MP and his name was also mentioned in the scandal of note-blowing in Parliament
 2008 ke is maamle ko ham or aap 'cash for vot' ke naam se jaanate hai
 The Congress government was accused by lawmakers of waving notes in Parliament to buy mps to vote in their favor
 unhone ek sting karne kaa daawa bhi kiya jo tamaam tivi channelon main chalaa bhi
 It is said that the same Kulkarni sir was the brain behind the sting operation
 bijepi ke diggaj netaa or purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi or laalkrishna adwani ke bhaashan bhi kulkarni likhaa karte the
 Although there was no concrete evidence to bribe the parliamentary committee set up to investigate the Cash for Vote case, but in 2009 the case was handed over to the police for investigation
 2011 main kulkarni ko giraftaar bhi kiya gaya tha
 i still remember Kulkarni's interview on a TV channel in which he said that if he had to go to jail for exposing some such work happening in Parliament, he was ready
 unke haav-bhav puri nishtha darsha rahe the
 It may have been my point of view, but i felt so

 kaha jaataa he ki unase anumati milane ke baad yah match ho paaya tha
 Even then it was a matter of embarrassment for the country and the state government and still is today

 congress kii sarkaar par apane paksh main voting karne ke liye saansadon ko kharidne kaa aarope sansad main note lahraane vaale saansadon ne lagaaya tha
 He also claimed to have done a sting which ran across all TV channels
 kehete hai ki sting oparation ke peeche bhi inhen kulkarni sahab kaa dimag tha
 Kulkarni also wrote speeches of veteran BJP leaders and former Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani
 vaise cash for vot ke maamle kii jaanch ke liye bani sansadeey samiti ko rishwat dene kaa thos saboot to nahin mila, lekin 2009 main is maamle ko police jaanch ke liye saunp diya gaya

 His expressions were showing full devotion

 There have been many occasions when the Shiv Sena has been trying to prove itself as a top figure in the state and especially in Mumbai
 aaj vah vakya bataanaa bhi praasangik ho jaataa he jab bharat or pakistan ke bich match ke liye bisisiai ke adhikariyon ko shivasena supremeo bala sahab thakare se mulaakaat kar match karaane kii anumati maangani padi thi
 It is said that the match was held after getting permission from him
 tab bhi yah desh or rajya sarkaar ke liye sharmindagi kaa vishay tha or aaj bhi he
 The question then arose in my mind that if the match was wrong then why was it allowed
 phir bisisiai vaale kyon ijaajat lene gaye the
 Was Thakre saheb government? tippaniyan Kulkarni also made the same mistake that he had gone to get 'permission' and permission was not granted
 ve bataa rahe hai ki kaarykram ke ek din pehle vah unase milane gaye the or charchaa kii thi
 Kulkarni already knows what is the way of opposition of Shiv Sena
 aapako yaad dilaate hai shahrukh khan kii film kaa jis prakaar virodh kiya gaya tha or vahi ek samay tha jab sarkaar ne apni manshaa ke saath-saath jameen par bhi yah dikhaaya ki vah jo chaahe karvaa sakati he or kanoon se bada koi nahin he
 The film was released and went on
 shivasena kii soch kii karaari haar hui thi
 i believe it is clear that if the government had the will, it would not have been a shameful incident
 lekin rajya kii devendra fadanvis sarkaar bhale hi ghatana ke baad lambi baaten kare lekin jameen par vah naakaam hi sabit hui he
 i also recall Kulkarni's statement today when he said on the CAS for vote scandal that he only played the role of a whistle blower
 or tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ke kadamon or raay se itar faisla sunaate hue hoicourt ne kaha tha ki agar in netaaon kaa makasad ghoose lenaa hota, to ve sting nahin karavaate
 After this decision, Kulkarni sent to Tihar Jail came out
 phir unke is kadam ne unhen vijeta ke rup main prastut kiya he
 i got convinced by Kulkarni ji
 shivasena ne kuch hi din pehle pakistani gazal gayak gulam ali kaa kaarykram radd karne par majaboor kar diya tha
 The government of Maharashtra was still a failure and still failed
 sarkaar main shivasena kii bhi bhagidaari he or kaarykram ko manjuuri milane ke baad party kaa aisa rukh sirf yahi dikhaa rahaa he ki party bijepi se apana swaarth saadhane main lagi he
 After the defeat of BJP in the assembly elections (I am saying defeat for not getting more seats), Shiv Sena is doing this type of action which causes BJP government to face the situation of Assam
 yahi nahin, centre main piem narendra modi par aajkal shivasena khub hamale kar rahi he
 This is the same PM Modi whom party supremo Bala Saheb Thackeray used to like and the party always supported him
 aise tamaam maukey aae hai jab shivasena, rajya or khaas taur par mumbai main apane ko sarkaar se upar kii hasti sabit karne kaa prayaas karti rahi he
 Today it also becomes relevant to narrate the incident when BCCI officials had to meet Shiv Sena Supremo Bala Saheb Thackeray and ask for permission for the match between India and Pakistan
 kaha jaataa he ki unase anumati milane ke baad yah match ho paaya tha
 Even then it was a matter of embarrassment for the country and the state government and still is today
 sawaal to tab yahi mere zahan main uthaa ki yadi match galat tha to kyon ijaajat di
 Then why did the BCCI people go for permission
 kya thakare sahab sarkaar the
 The comments kulkarni ne bhi yahi galati kii ki ve 'ijaajat' lene gaye the or ijaajat nahin mili
 They are telling that he went to meet them a day before the program and discussed
 kulkarni ji to pehle hi jaanate hai ki shivasena kaa virodh kaa tarika kya rahata he
 Remind you the way Shahrukh Khan's film was opposed and there was a time when the government showed its intention as well as on the ground that it can do whatever it wants and there is no bigger than law
 film relies bhi hui or chali bhi
 The thinking of Shiv Sena was defeated
 meraa to maananaa saaf he ki yadi sarkaar kii ichhashakti hoti to yah desh ko sharmasaar karne vaali vaardaat nahin ho paati
 But even though the Devendra Fadnavis government of the state may talk long after the incident, it has proved to be a failure on the ground
 shivasena ne kuch hi din pehle pakistani gazal gayak gulam ali kaa kaarykram radd karne par majaboor kar diya tha
