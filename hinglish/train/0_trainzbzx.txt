 The newly liberated terrorists, who have come in a blind race between the terrorists and the police, pose a serious challenge to the police system
 aatank kii yah nai prajati kai maamalon main dur se hi aatanki gatividhiyon ko anjaam dene main inke aakaaon ke liye suvidhajanak ho gai he
 In this method, the risk is less and the effect is more
 sabase badhkar yah ki aakaaon par najar bhi nahin padati
 This is also important for the terrorists because they are finding it difficult to continue their activities in an environment where every country has formed a special anti-terror police and has enacted such complex anti-terror laws that make terrorists The scope of the attack is decreasing and the price is also very high
 yahi vajah he ki lashkar jaisaa sangathit aatanki gut apane paas hone ke baavjood pakistan kii khufia agency iesai ko mumbai main 26 / 11 kaa hamalaa anjaam dene ke liye david colman hedli jaise kisi shaks kii jarurat padati he jo bilashak aaazaad kism kaa hi tha lekin bade hamale karne kii khwaahish rakhata tha
 Headley's arrest removed the plot of this attack
 yahi vah ‘‘chook’’ thi jiske chalate guptchar beuro ke bheetar real time guptchar soochnaaon ke liye ek multi agency centre (mike) banane kii jarurat aan padi, bharat ko jisaki vajah se apana imigration trekking system atyaadhunik bananaa padaa or desh main kanoon anupaalan ke sangheey dhaanche se paidaa hone vaale avarodhon ko dur karne par nae sire se kaam karnaa padaa
 The main concern of the authorities is that they come to know about them only when an incident happens or is about to happen
 masalan, patna dhamaakon se pehle suraksha agenciyon ko khabar tak nahin thi ki simi kaa ek nayaa sanskaran paidaa ho chukaa he
 That is why the real challenge for the police is to find a way to find out about these attacks beforehand
 pichley saal se sara jor isi tareeke par rahaa he jiske tahat ek kattarpanthi ke aatanki banane se pehle usase nibatane ke liye sakriy najariya apanaaya gaya he
 Some of the steps being taken to curb terrorism in the country are: Surveillance and anti-arguments on the Internet: The objective is to create an alternative material in response to terrorist propaganda material on the net, enter the square rooms and present a cut of ideological arguments and Also keep track of other participants involved in the debates
 neshnal technical research orgenigeshan, computer immergency rispance team or department of electronics and information technology jaisi agenciyaan is uddeshy se sibar spes main apni maujuudagi badhaane ke liye apni kshamta badha rahi hai
 Terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda have also started competing against it
 ve sarkari websiton ko hack karne or unhen bigaadpee kii apni kshamtaaon ko badha rahe hai
 Internet companies such as Google and Yahoo are being persuaded to set up their servers in India, removing barriers to sovereignty
 aatanki maamalon kii jaanch main bharat ke jaanchakartaaon ko sabase badi baadha yah aati he ki unhen lambii kanoonee prakriyaaon kaa intjaar karnaa padataa he, jaise ki adaalaton se anumati patr hasil karnaa taaki unhen dikhaakar videsh main baithi companiyon se suchanaaen hasil kii ja saken
 This process takes a lot of time, so now there is talk of using diplomatic relations with like-minded countries for such cooperation
 alpsankhyakon tak pahunchah rajyon se kaha ja rahaa he ki ve apane police prashasan kaa istemaal karke alpsankhyak samudaayon ke saath majboot rishte banaaen
 Intelligence agencies have admitted that their ground hold on this front has weakened and that is why confidence-building measures are being considered
 is disha main pehla kadam yah hoga ki bekasoor musalmaan naujavaanon ko aatanki hamalon main na fansaaya jaae
 The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is particularly cautious about this, but if the agencies were used for political purposes, the entire exercise would be in vain
 praudyogiki vistaara sandigdhon ke vivaran or unki aawaaj ke namoonon kaa database kaayam karnaa, mithravat deshon kii agenciyon ke saath soochnaaon ke milan kii kshamta jaise kuch aise praudyogikeey kadam hai jin par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Home Ministry officials say that security agencies in the West are able to track profiles more quickly because their database management is more efficient and flexible
 masalan, iageies ke video main maujuud aawaaj se hi ve vyakti kii pahchaan kar leti hai
 On the other hand, the condition in India is that Yasin Bhatkal had been wandering and avoiding Indian agencies for seven years

 Apart from this, the Home Ministry is going to bring an all India phone number on which any citizen of the country can give any terrorist information

 kedarnath main puja shuru hone main abhi ek maheene se zyada vakt bachaa he
 But this time when the temple opens, a new abode of faith will open with it
 ab kedaar main ek aisi shakti kii puja shuru hogi, jisane mahavinaash main bhagwaan kedaar ke mandir kii suraksha kii
 How can anyone forget that shocking flood of 16 and 17 June? That devastating inundation had ruined the entire Kedardham
 majboot se majboot imaaraton ko tinke kii tarah bahaata le gaya wo sailaab
 Kedardham's nomination was erased within a few minutes
 lekin agar is tabaahi ke bich bhi kedarnath kaa mandir chattan kii tarah khadaa rahaa to iske peeche koi chamatkaar nahin, ek chattan hi thi
 a large rock saved the Kedarnath temple from damage
 ye chattan mandir ke thik peeche he, jahaan se 16 june ko sailaab aayaa tha
 Now the state government has declared this rock as a divine rock and when the temple of Kedarnath will open from September 11, this divine stone will also be worshiped
 jaahir he, tabaahi ke baad jab mandir khulegaa to shraddhaluon kaa mastak is divya shila ke aage bhi jhukegaa
 The Uttarakhand government has asked the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to preserve this divine rock behind the temple
 saath sant samaaj se apil kii gai he ki mandir kii raksha karne vaali shila ko divya shila ke taur par sthapit kiya jaae or divya shila ke darshan kiye bina kedarnath kii yatra adhuri maani jaae
 Pooja archana will begin again on September 11 on the day of Sarvartha Siddhi Amrit Yoga in Kedarnath Temple
 jab bhakton ko puure kedanath kaa nayaa rup najar aayega or usee din se divya shila ko bhi puuje jane kii taiyaari he
 The Sant Samaj has also welcomed the government's decision
 jis divya shila ko vigyaan ne bhi mandir kaa rakshak mana, wo jald hi aasthaa kaa nayaa centre hoga
 The one who stood taunted even in the great ravages, suffered injuries from the biggest rocks that came with the flood and did not let the hair of the temple of Bhole be shaken
 kehane vaale to yah bhi kah sakate hai ki ek chattan ne sailaab kii disha badal di, isamen chamatkaar kaisaa? samudr kii sataha se 3583 meter kii oonchai par bana he kedarnath mandir
 If the temple of Nath survived despite the destruction of the Dham in the Sailab that came on 16 and 17 June, it was the reason for this
 uttarakhand spes aplicoshan centre yani you-sac ne rajya sarkaar ko di apni report main tabaahi kaa jo puraa byoraa diya he
 Its base is made of satellite images before the disaster and after the disaster
 report main bataaya gaya he ki kedarnath ke upar chorabari glacier or companian glacier ke alaava rambada tak you aakaar ke kai glacier hai, jinamein glacier kaa malba yani moren diposit bharaa hua he
 On the night of 16 and 17 June, so much water fell in this area that three streams of Mandakini erupted
 in dhaaraon se malba bhi hokar niklaa or tabaahi machaai gai
 Actually, where the temple of Kedarnath is built, that too was once the way of Mandakini
 jab upar pahaad par baari barish hui or glacier ke barf pighalane lagi to mandakini apane usee puraane raste par nikal padi
 But Mandakini's stream coming at a great speed also reached the Kedarnath temple and turned left
 or mandir ko koi nuksaan nahin hua
 On that day, before the waves of Mandakini came at full speed, they collided with the celestial rock and swung to the left and the huge stones falling with the waves stopped them before the temple walls collapsed
 
 aakhir is chattan ko chamatkaari kahen bhi to kyon nahin, sailaab kii jis tej dhar main 14 kilometre tak puraa pahaad bah gaya uski dhara ko ek chattan ne kaise mode diya? bharat ke 12 jyortelingon main kedarnath sabase oonchai par virajman hai
 Six months of the year there is an influx of devotion, devotion and faith
 lekin 16-17 june ko ai tabaahi ke sailaab ke baad yahaan sannata pasra hua he
 Not only was Kedarnath devastated by the inundation, but all the routes to Kedarnath were destroyed
 kedarnath ke liye paidal yatra 1900 meter kii oonchai par gaurikund se hoti he, jo kareeb 2500 meter kii oonchai par maujuud rambada se hote hue kedarnath tak pahunchati he
 But the route up to 14 kilometers was destroyed by the flood
 jaahir he is chattan ke aage ek aisi pralayakari dhar haar gai, jis par tabaahi hi tabaahi likhi hui thi
 The inundation, which buried the entire Kedardham in the debris more than six feet high, could not even touch the temple wall
 kudarat ke kahar main dikhaa ye hi chamatkaar ab aasthaa kaa nayaa dham hoga
 This rock protecting Nath will be worshiped

 It was a very close match, as the score suggests
 ’bhartiya captain ne kaha ki strokes khelnaa kaaphi mushkil ho rahaa tha kyonki gend balle par nahin aa rahi thi
 Dhoni said, "there was a little bounce for the spinners and for the fast bowlers, the ball was stopping a bit
 agar aap shaat lagaana chaahate ho to aapako iske prati satark hona padataa
 If you were not there, you would have been caught out at midwicket or covers
 ’unhone kaha ki unki ranneeti daudkar jitna jaldi ho sake ran batorna tha taaki scoreboard chalyman rah sake kyonki chauke lagaana kaaphi mushkil ho rahaa tha
 Dhoni said, 'it was easy to stay on the wicket but it was very difficult to get runs
 hamamen se kuch ne sochaa ki agar ham rotate kar sakate hai or match ke dauraan ek do ran banaate rahenge to hamaare liye aasaani ho jaayegi
 Virat Kohli scored a half-century but he could not convert it into a big innings, when asked about this, Dhoni said that this young cricketer from Delhi will learn everything with time

 However, when Anand l Rai was asked about this, he said that he has not yet done any discussion with Salman for a film

 Rosemary Korda, principal researcher at the Australian National University (ANU) said, "the lower your education, the more likely you are to have a heart attack or stroke, this fact is disturbing, but the findings are clear
 
 " Research found that adults who had no educational qualification were twice as likely (about 150 percent more) to have a heart attack than people with a university degree

 Municipal Corporation of Delhi has devised a unique way to provide world class toilets for free to the common people
 dilachasp baat yah he ki MCD ne bhi in toilet ko banane or inke mentanence par kuch kharch nahin kiya he
 Actually, MCD has given the responsibility of building and maintaining the toilet in the national capital Delhi to Hindustan Advertising Company
 iske alaava is company ko licencing fees (licensing Fee) ke rup main MCD ko 38 lakh rupee har maheene de rahi he
 At the same time, the company is removing all these expenses through advertising
 ye toilet na sirf five star hotel, airport or mal main bane toilet kii tarj par banaae gaye hai, balki videshi tach ke saath banaae gaye hai
 Along with being women friendly, child friendly and old age friendly, they are also convenient for people with disabilities
 yahaan sainitory pad (sanitary pads) sirf 5 rupee main mil rahe he or entry free he
 a user woman told that she goes out many times, but the toilets get very dirty, but seeing the cleanliness and maintenance of these toilets, it feels like giving some money on your behalf
 south dilli municipal corporation main RP Cell or edvertising ke dipti kamishnar prem shankar jha ne kaha, 'mentenence ko lekar ham kaaphi gambhir hai
 This is the reason that the street furniture maintenance van will have a GPS, which will tell how many places the garbage was picked up
 toilet kitne saaf kiya gaye isaki masik report sabamit hogi
 Public k feedback is also available
 'world class toilet ko mentenence karne vaali company hindustan edvertising ke chif agxcutive afasar ritesh ke mutabik 38 lakh har maheene MCD ko licencing fees (licensing Fee) ke rup main diya ja rahaa he
 Maintaining these toilets for about 7 years
 bench dustbin to steel ke hai hi
 All helpline numbers are written on the police booth
 edvertisingpol par bhi vertical gardening kii gai he
 Let us tell you that during the Commonwealth Games, the goal was to build such a world class toilet
 iske liye saal 2010 main tender bhi jari kiya gaya tha
 With this, the MCD used to earn Rs 3-4 lakh every month
 saal 2017 main tender khatm hote hi pichley saal open tender jari kiya gaya, lekin biding hone par 2 baar tender ko lene koi saamne nahin aayaa
 However, now MCD is earning about Rs 38 lakhs revenue every month
 aisa kuch badlaav ke kaaran hua
 The cluster mode was adopted by removing the advertiser and giving the contractor himself to run it
 south dilli municipal corporation ke edvertising ke cluster 1A ne india habitate centre (india Habitat Centre) se nizamuddin golchakkar kaa jayja liya, to pataa laga ki dayaal singh college, lodhi colony, nehru stadium, greater kailash, hansraj gupta maarg or bhishma pitamah maarg par sadak kinare bane in toilet kaa istemaal zyaadaatar pisiar vine par tainaat pulicekarmi, college going girls or baahar se aane vaale log kar rahe hai
 When the Election Commission gave a big blow to the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of Delhi, there was a wave of happiness in opposition parties like BJP and Congress
 shuukravaar ko ayog ne sansadeey sachiv ke rup main laabh ke pad dhaaran karne ke aarope main AAP ke 20 vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit kiye jane kii raashtrapati ramnath kovind se sifarish kar di
 Opposition parties like BJP and Congress are very happy with this
 inaki khushi kii vajah yah he ki agar AAP ke in vidhayakon kii vidhansabha sadsyta radd hoti he, to dilli main in siton par phir se chunaav honge
 These parties are hopeful of victory in the upcoming assembly elections
 saat farvari 2015 ko dilli main hue vidhansabha chunaav main arvind kejariwal ke netritv vaali AAP ko aitihaasik jeet mili thi, jabaki bijepi or congress ko karaari haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 These parties, which lost badly in the last assembly elections, have also started preparing for re-election
 isi kadi main shuukravaar ko congress ne pichley chunaav main apane haare hue pratyaashiyon ke saath baithak kii, jisamen dilli ke maujuuda raajnneetik halaat or aage kii ranneeti par charchaa hui
 At the same time, the BJP is also making a different strategy for the election
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main congress or bijepi ko aam aadmi party ne buree tarah haraaya tha
 In this, the Congress could not win a single seat and the BJP was reduced to just three seats
 haalanki vidhansabha chunaav ke baad hue nagar nikaay chunaav main bijepi ko shandaar jeet mili thi
 On the other hand, AAP did not perform well in MCD elections as compared to assembly elections, which has increased the expectations of BJP and Congress even more
 in dalon ko lagata he ki agar ab dilli main chunaav hote hai, to pichhali baar ke mukaable is baar unke paksh main behatar najite aaenge
 Especially the Congress is expected to get entry in the assembly
 philhal 70 sadasyeey dilli vidhansabha main bijepi ke teen vidhayak hai, lekin congress kaa patta saaf he
 If the membership of these 20 AAP mlas is canceled, then their number in the Assembly will come down from 66 to 46 directly
 iske alaava vidhayak kapil sharma baagi ho chuke hai
 While Kumar Vishwas is angered by not being sent to the Rajya Sabha and is told that he has the support of around 10 mlas, he can change his seat, given the opportunity
 lihaaja kejariwal sarkaar par sankat ke badal mandaraate dikh rahe hai
 Although the AAP has approached the High Court against the recommendation of the Election Commission, it has not received immediate relief from there
 ab somvaar ko maamle kii sunwaayee hogi
 Looking at the current political scenario, one thing is clear that the political developments in Delhi are going to be very exciting in the coming times
 haalanki yah to vakt hi batayega ki raajnneetik palada kiskaa baari hota he
 The local bodies have lost in the elections, the AAP party's poor performance in the local bodies in Delhi is also troubling them
 pichley saal april main hue chunaav main uttari dilli nagar nigam main bhaajapa ko 64 seat mili jabaki aap ko 21 seat hasil hui
 At the same time, in the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, BJP got 70 seats and AAP got 16 seats while Congress got 12 seats
 yahi haal purvi dilli nagar nikaay chunaav main hua, jahaan bhaajapa ko 47, aap ko 13 or congress ko 3 siten hasil huin
 The BJP won a majority in the Delhi Municipal elections for the third time in a row under the AAP party government
 20 vidhayakon kii sadsytajane kii surat main dilli main upachunaav karaae jaaenge hi
 At the same time, if all these situations of the above converge, then the existence of a new government can be a crisis and Delhi may face a new election, now it is time
 saal 2015 main AAP ne bijepi kii ummiido par pher diya tha panichaar disambar 2013 ko hue chunaav main bijepi ko aas thi ki vah satta main lautegi, lekin trishanku vidhansabha ne uske armaanon par pani pher diya
 It emerged as the top party in the state by securing 31 seats, but the Congress, which won eight seats, gave its support to the AAP party which won 28 seats, with Arvind Kejriwal forming the government
 haalanki yah sarkaar mahaj 49 din hi chal saki, kyonki kejariwal ne janalokapal bill paas nahin kar paane kii naakaami ko sweekaarte hue istipha de diya
 After this, it was being said that Kejriwal was excited about the electoral success in Delhi and wanted to claim a big victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but this time he failed
 phir kareeb ek saal ke intjaar ke baad dilli ne dobaaraa vidhansabha chunaav (2015) hue or is baar AAP ne saare kayaason ko dhata bataate hue 70 main se 67 seat apane naam kar lee
 The BJP and the Congress were left as mere spectators

 "he said," The decision to oust Bhubaneswar was not right
 haalanki ishanth sharma ko apni lambaai se phayda mil saktaa he, isse viraat kohli ne bhubaneshwar kumaar ke aatmavishvaas ko giraaya he
 Sehwag said that he could have fed Ishant in exchange for another bowler
 bhubaneshwar ne capatoun main acha pradarshan kiya tha or is tarah se unhen baahar karnaa uchit nahin he
 Earlier, according to the agency, Gavaskar said, 'I believe that the goat of Shikhar Dhawan Bali has been made and the sword always hangs on his head
 bas ek kharaab pari ke baad use team se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Gavaskar said, "it is beyond my understanding why Ishant was chosen in place of Bhubaneswar
" eshanth team main shami yaa bumraah kii jagah le saktaa tha, lekin bhubaneshwar ko baahar rakhana samaj se baahar he

 Former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi alleged that after two years the state government has failed to provide land for another super specialty hospital and medical college like another All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bihar 
 susheel modi ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki kendriya vittamantri arun jetali ne pradhanmantri ke nirdesh par varsh 2015-16 ke apane bajet bhaashan main bihar main ek or ames jaise santhaan kholane kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Since then, the Health Minister of the Government of India has written more than half a dozen letters to the Government of Bihar to inform the selection of 200 acres of land with water, electricity and road connectivity for AIIMS construction, but the State Government has not responded
 
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar ke lagaataar patr likhe jane ke baad ab maamle ko uljhane ke liye rajya sarkaar jila kaa chayan karne ke liye centre sarkaar ko hi kah rahi he, jabaki jila kaa chayan or jameen uplabdh karana rajya kaa daayitv he
 The comments bhaajapa netaa ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar nahin chaahati he ki bihar main centre sarkaar kaa koi bada santhaan khule or iskaa shrey pradhanmantri narendra modi ko mili
 This is the reason why even after two years, the state government has not been able to select land and district for AIIMS
 ullekhneey he ki patna main ek ames pehle se hi he
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Sushil Modi said on Wednesday that Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced the opening of another aiims-like institute in Bihar in his budget speech for the year 2015-16 on the instructions of the Prime Minister
 iske baad se ab tak bharat sarkaar ke swasthya mantri ames nirmaan ke liye pani, bijli or sadak samparkta vaali 200 acre jameen kaa chayan kar suchit karne ke liye aadhe darjan se adhik patr bihar sarkaar ko likh chuke hai parantu rajya sarkaar ne koi jawaab nahin diya
 He said that after continuously writing letters to the central government, now the state government is asking the central government to select the district to confuse the matter, while it is the responsibility of the state to select the district and provide land
 tippaniyan The BJP leader said that the state government does not want any big central government institute to open in Bihar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets credit for it
 yahi kaaran he ki do saal baad bhi rajya sarkaar ames ke liye jameen or jila kaa chayan nahin kar saki he
 It is worth mentioning that there is already an AIIMS in Patna

 The dream of Metro will soon come true for the people of Bangalore

 So why don't we leave the car and use it

 The higher education system of our country has collapsed badly
 is shiksha se zyaadaatar rojgaar yaa naukari ke liye naakaabil graduate hi paidaa ho rahe hai
 This education is not encouraging research and innovation and hence it is undemocratic
 aaie pehle in muddon par vistaar se baat karen
 One, our graduates on a very large scale are not fit for employment or jobs
 unamem rojgaar kshamta 10 se 26 fisadi ke bich hi jhulati rahati he
 About 36 per cent of our industries are unable to recruit for the initial positions
 isse hamaari rashtriya aarthik pragati kaaphi had tak simit ho jaati he
 Therefore, there is scope for widespread discontent and unrest in the country
 duusare, hamaari shiksha vyavastha shodh or navachaar ke kshetra main bhi kuch khaas pragati nahin dikhaa paa rahi he
 Only through research, research and innovation can a country prove the strength and superiority of its leadership capacity on the global stage
 apni aarthik, samrik or saanskrithik sehat ko sabal bana saktaa he
 Just think: per capita applications of patents in the US Patent and Trademark Office are 277 times more than us
 itnaa hi nahin, hamaare mukaable korian log prati patent 75 fisadi kam rakam kharch karke patent hasil kar lete hai
 In the field of humanities and social science, our emphasis is only on assimilating knowledge from elsewhere
 is tarah bharat main jo gyaan paidaa ho rahaa he, vah yaa to kahin or ke gyaan kii hi tasdik karata he yaa use hi aage badhaata he, jiskaa strot bharat ke baahar he
 Ultimately, our education system is based on gross non-parity
 zyaadaatar garib chaatr to ucch shiksha kaa kharch uthaane ke kaabil hi nahin hai
 352 crore in India in 2012-13
 ucch shiksha kii chaatravritiyon par kharch kiye gaye
 It is a mere Rs 164 if the per capita basis is divided
 prati chaatr padataa he
 There are plans for cheap loans, but the question is how effective they are
 zyaadaatar log uskaa istemaal hi nahin karte
 Successive governments have spent crores of rupees on higher education, especially for the poor
 sabsidi main bahaae, lekin iskaa phayda bhi sirf unheen logon ko mila, jo garib nahin hai
 Poor people are not able to afford higher education despite subsidies
 unke bachche aksar barahavin ke baad hi padhai chhodie ke liye majaboor ho jate hai
 Therefore, our Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher secondary education gets stuck at just 49 per cent and in case of higher education at 21 per cent
 jaahir he, hamen is vyavastha ko fouran puri tarah durust karne kii jarurat he
 Such an integrated policy should be made, which can elevate the academic standard, increase the accountability of all educational institutions, help the poor students in the total cost of education, encourage research and make higher education our real life
 To be connected to needs
 rojgaar yaa naukari ke maamle main naakabiliyat kii ekmaatr mahatvapurn vajah shikshan or adhyaapan kaa kamjor str he
 The level of teaching can be improved by training teachers and arranging formal assessment of specific subjects through well-planned online courses
 shiksha sansthaanon ko bhi chahie ki ve in paimaanon ko saarvajanik taur par logon ke saath saajha karen
 In addition, the annual increase in the teacher's remuneration package should be seen in conjunction with his / her teaching ability
 iskaa aankalan kisi vishay vishesh main us shikshak ke chaatro ke pradarshan se kiya ja saktaa he
 Due to the low academic level, there is also a system of affiliation, in which universities become merely 'controllers of Examinations' and in this way, the 'business' of education has serious elements to enter
 is araajaktaa se baahar nikalne or iske badale kathor acreditation pranali kaayam karne se bhi academik gunvattta main ijapha hoga
 This system will evaluate the quality and level of each institution-specific course
 hamaari ucch shiksha vyavastha ko aisa banaaya janaa chahie ki vah garibon ke liye madadgaar ho
 Under this, large-scale grant programs should be started for poor students, which would be sufficient for their living apart from their education expenses
 aise kaarykram se sakal daakhila anupaat main vruddhi hogi, saamaajik samta badhegi or santhaan apana academik str sudhaarney par majaboor honge
 The capacity of the higher education system has increased considerably in recent decades
 isamen bahut bada yogadan swa-vittposhit sansthaanon kii badhati hui sankhya ko bhi jaataa he, jo do-tihaai chaatro ko sthaan de rahe hai or jahaan ho rahe daakhile kaa pratishat sarkari sansthaanon ke mukaable 15 fisadi adhik kii dar se bad rahaa he
 This has undoubtedly increased the admissions capacity, but many private institutions are making huge scams in terms of academic curriculum, fees and academic standards
 aise dhandhebaajon se chaatro kii raksha ke liye rajya str par tribunel gathit kiye ja sakate hai
 Apart from this, publicity of fee structure, faculty details and accreditation will be put on the businessmen
 antat hamen yah bhi jaanane kii jarurat he ki ucchtar shiksha kii hamaari maujuuda niamak vyavastha nihaayat lachar or aparyaapt he
 It is run by a few dozen part-time experts and bureaucrats
 iske badale hamen peshewar sansthaanon kii ore se chalaai jane vaali acreditation pranali kii darkaar he
 Education institutions should also be judged on the basis of their policy documents and strategies to achieve targets
 hamaare paas duniya main sabase vishaal ucch shiksha tantra or sasta maanav shram he
 Therefore, we are not only in a better position to fulfill our needs, but we are also in a position to be established as a center of education in the world
 lekin yah tabhi sambhav hoga, jab ham apni shiksha vyavastha ko durust kar lenge
 (nachiketa Tiwari is an Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur) titannic jahaaj ko ek baar phir samandar main utaare kii taiyaari chal rahi he
 Not only this, it is also being claimed that this 'titanic 2' will be the safest cruiseship in the world, it will also have a sufficient number of life boats
 australia ke ek arbapati clive palamar ne titannic-2 kaa blueprint jari kiya he or iske 2016 tak safar ke liye taiyaar ho jane kii bhi ummid jataai he

 jahaaj banane kaa kaam jaldi hi china main shuru kiya jayega
 Titanic 2 will be similar to Titanic but it will have special security arrangements
 palamar ke mutabik titannic-2 main paryaapt lifebot rahengi
 Although the builders of the Titanic called it a never sinking ship, Palmer does not want to say anything like that for the Titanic-2
 unka kahana he ki chhed karne par koi bhi cheez dub sakati he
 Due to the impact of global warming, there are no more icebergs in the North Atlantic than before
 palamar titannic 2 se logon ko titannic kaa hi anubhav dena chaahate hai
 For this, the interior is planned to be like the interior of Titanic
 isamen bhi vishaal seedhiyaan, turkish bath or puraane daur ke class divijan
 Three passenger classes will also be placed in this ship, which will not be mixed
 iske pehle safar ke tikat kharidne main 40,000 log abhi se ruchi dikhaa chuke hai
 The journey will start from Southampton in England to New York
 haalanki har cheez puraane style main hi rakhi jaaegi par aadhunik suvidhaayen bhi di jaaengi jaise ki airkandishning or sefti
 Significantly, the Titanic on its journey to New York was sunk in the Atlantic Ocean after hitting a icy rock one night in 1912

 gaanvvaalon kaa kahana he ki kartab dikhaane vaale ek group ke saath aae sumit ne na keval 7 din tak lagaataar cycle chalaai balki uske baad usee group ke logon ne use paanch feet gahare gadde main yah kahkar dabaa diya ki 24 ghante baad vah jinda nikal aayega
 But on the night of 25 June, at 1130, Sumit was brought out of the pit in unconscious condition and was declared dead in the hospital
 sumit ko gadde main dabaane or jaan lene ke aarope main police ne ek FIR darj kii or chaar logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The comments maamla 17 june kaa he jab panipat ke chulkana gaanv main kuch log kartab dikhaane ke liye aae the or unhone iske jariye paise ikatthe kiye
 The villagers say that when the committee was dumped in the pit, then the head of the group demanded 11 thousand to take it out
 gaanvvaalon ne is tamaashe ke liye 8 hajaar jamaakar kar bachche ko baahar nikaalane ko kaha, lekin group ke mukhiya 11 hajaar kii maang par ada rahaa
 Sumit's father Mamchand told NDTV India, 'he took his son from Kurad village with a lure of wages for good money
 sumit kaa bhai or nani is dauraan chulkana gaanv pahunche the jab use dabaaya gaya tha
 He too requested to remove Sumit from the pit, but he was silenced by greed for money
 ' ab jahaan sumit ke mata-pita ise hatya kaa maamla bataa rahe hai vahiin chulkana gaanv ke log is baat se dare hue hai ki police is maamle main unhen bhi pareshaan kar sakati he
 The people of the village admitted that such games have been done before, but in Sumit's case, carelessness was taken
 maamle kii jaanch kar rahe esechao jitendra singh ne kaha ki is tarah ke kartabon kii baat unhone suni thi, lekin pehla maamla unke saamne aayaa he jahaan kisi kii is tarah maut hui ho
 Police is investigating the matter by arresting four people
 kartab dikhaane vaale log sumit ke gaanv kurad ke hi hai jo chulkana gaanv se 40 kilometre dur he
 The case dates back to June 17 when some people came to Chulakana village in Panipat to perform tricks and collected money through it
 gaanvvaalon kaa kahana he ki jab samit ko gadde main daalaa gaya to uske baad group ke mukhiya ne use nikaalane ke liye 11 hajaar kii maang kii
 The villagers deposited 8 thousand for this spectacle and asked to take the child out, but the head of the group remained adamant on the demand of 11 thousand
 sumit ke pita maamchand ne enditivi india se kaha, 'uske bete ko achche paison par mazdooree kaa laalach dekar kurad gaanv se le gaye the
 Sumit's brother and grandmother reached Chulakana village when he was pressed
 unhone bhi sumit ko gadde se nikaalane kii fariyaad kii thi, lekin unhen paise kaa laalach dekar chup karvaa diya gaya
 'now that Sumit's parents are describing it as a case of murder, the people of Chulakana village are scared that the police can harass them in this case too
 gaanv ke logon ne mana ki aise khel pehle bhi hote rahe hai, lekin sumit ke maamle main bahut laaparvaahee barti gai
 SHO Jitendra Singh, who is investigating the case, said that he had heard of such tricks, but the first case has come before him where someone has died in this way
 police is maamle main chaar logon ko giraftaar kar jaanch kar rahi he
 The people who perform the feat are from the village of Kurad, Sumit, which is 40 km from Chulakana village

 Even though Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party are trying to keep the message away from the media headlines and rhetoric at the moment, now all their focus is only on Delhi and not on contesting elections in other states, so Is not
 party ke vishwast sutron ne 'aaj tak' ko bataaya he ki party duusare rajyon main apane vistaar ke kaarykram ko lagaataar badha rahi he
 According to sources, on November 5 this year, the party is preparing for a big public meeting in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, which will be addressed by the party's chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 vidhansabha chunaav ladane kii taiyaaridilli ke siem kejariwal5 november ko madhya pradesh kaa daura karenge
 Not only this, sources said that Arvind Kejriwal can declare to contest Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections to be held exactly 1 year after the platform of this rally to be held in Bhopal on 5 November
 aam aadmi party agle saal hone vaale madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan vidhansabha chunaav ladane kii taiyaari joro-shoron se kar rahi he
 For this, instructions have already been given to the leaders in the three states to strengthen the organization up to the booth level
 bhopal main hogi AAP kii jansabhaam aadmi partike madhya pradesh sanyojak alok agarwal ne 5 november ko bhopal main hone vaali jansabha kii khabar ko spasht karte hue kaha ki us taarikh ko aam aadmi party madhya pradesh se bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii muhim kaa shankhanaad karegi
 This is obviously a sign of contesting the assembly elections
 madhya pradesh main agle saal november maheene main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, jiske liye aam aadmi party ke paas paryaapt vakt he
 The battle in Madhya Pradesh is directly between Shivraj Singh Chauhan's BJP government in power and Congress sitting in opposition, in such a situation, the Aam Aadmi Party as a third party will have to work very hard to find their land
 gujarat main chunaav ladegi aapina khabaron se ek baat or spasht he ki bhale hi aam aadmi party ke bade netaa surkhiyon se dur bane hon or arvind kejariwal chuppi saadhe hon, lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin ki party chupchaap simat gai he
 Rather, the Aam Aadmi Party and all its leaders are silently trying to strengthen their land in other states without making noise
 itnaa hi nahin aam aadmi party ne bavana upachunaav jeetne ke baad isi saal gujarat main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main zyaadaatar siton par ladane kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di he
 Delhi will remain more focused Kejriwal will once again start bugging his political ambitions from November
 haalanki party ke sutron kaa yah bhi kahana he 2018 kii pehali chamahi tak kejariwal kaa zyaadaatar samaydilli menhi beetegaa or unka puraa dhyaan sarkaar chalaane par hi hoga, lekin jarurat padane par bich-bich main vah chunaav kii taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene ke liye un rajyon kaa daura kar sakate hai
 The dispute between the Delhi Government and the Deputy Governor over the deployment and transfer of Chief Secretary and Secretary level officials has turned into a fight
 donon paksh niyamon or praavdhaanon kaa apane apane hisaab se matlab nikaal rahe hai
 There has been a lot of confusion about Delhi, so every Chief Minister has demanded full state control by handing over control of police and land matters to them
 congress or bijepi donon ne aisa kiya he or donon ne aisa tab kiya he jab centre main unki virdohi sarkaar ho
 Both keep this fight on hold if there is a favorable government
 dilli ab badal gai he
 This state, with a population of about two crores, cannot be seen as a government of anything more than a municipality for a long time
 jis samvidhan ne dilli ko centre shasit rajya kaa darja diya he usamen kahin nahin likhaa he ki dilli ke liye jo vyavastha kii ja rahi he wo antim he
 Surprised when the BJP, which fought the longest battle to grant full state status, considered it incomplete or inadequate, favored the Lieutenant Governor
 qaayade se maujuuda vivaad par bijepi apni puraani maang ke auchity ko majbooti se rakh sakati thi or uparajyapal ke adhikaron ko simit karne kii line le sakati thi jaisi baaki dalon ne lee he
 Now the BJP is not tired of saying that the Lieutenant Governor is more powerful than the elected Chief Minister and there is no benefit in hitting the head with this system of constitution
 yahaan tak ki yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ke swaraj manch ne bhi is mudde par up rajyapal kaa saath nahin diya he
 The Congress, which made excuses for not giving full statehood for ten years, has also not supported the Lieutenant Governor
 us uparajyapal kaa jisaki niyukti congress ne hi kii thi
 If you look at this controversy from the perspective of the Prime Minister's associate federalism, then the activism of BJP is surprised
 uparajyapal kii ati sakriyata centre kii shah par ho yaa bina shah ke lekin pradhanmantri ke sahyogi sanghavaad ke kilaaf to he hi
 How will work if a chief minister does not make his team
 uske adhikariyon kii niyukti or tabadalaa koi or karegaa to kya chunaav main uparajyapal javabdehi lenge
 It will go out among the public and say that it is not the Chief Minister's fault because i was driving the officials
 jab pradhanmantri adhyadesh laakar apane liye yogya adhikari kii niyukti kar sakate hai to dilli sarkaar ke hit main niyamon ko kyon nahin badla ja saktaa
 Even if you do not want to give full state status, a elected representative can be given the basic right to form his own team
 milanaa hi chahie
 The mistake has also happened to the Kejriwal government
 loktantr main har ladaai sadak kii nahin hoti
 By accusing an officer, locking in an officer's room, he cannot fight by telling the lieutenant governor as an agent
 vaise har dal ke mukhyamantri ne rajyapalon ko agent bataaya he
 They have been dragged from the road to the court
 inamen se kai mukhyamantri raajnneeti se ritair hone ke baad rajyapal bhi bane hai! agar shakuntla gamelin kisi company kii agent hai to unka urja sachiv ke pad se tabadalaa kyon nahin kiya gaya jaise baaki adhikariyon kaa kiya gaya
 What would happen with a ten-day appointment? Was it a plan that the Chief Secretary who was on leave should not return and make Gamlin the same
 yah sab ashankaayen hai jinhen saarvajanik rup se mathne par mattha hi nikalegaa
 Not lassi
 shakuntla gamelin ke mahila hone kaa sawaal betuka he
 In that sense, the Prime Minister could not have removed Sujatha Singh from the post of Foreign Secretary even though he had seven months left to retire
 tab to ek mahila ke saath ninsaphi kaa sawaal nahin judaa tha
 Sujata Singh resigned to save her honor and the IAS officers' union did not even hold a meeting like it did in the context of the dispute
 chhattisgarh ke colectoron ko chashma pahanane par notice mila tab to omesh sagal ne der raat tak baithak nahin kii or sardaar patel kaa kathan nahin baancha
 Another question comes in the mind
 jab dilli ayog ke adhikari ashish joshi ko hataaya gaya tab uparajyapal ne hastkshep kyon nahin kiya
 Was the Chief Minister then approved from the Lt
 Governor? isliye donon pakshon ko lekar satarkta or samaan duuri baratani chahie
 The comments iees sangh kii baithak ke baad dilli ke purv sachiv omesh sahagal kaa bayaan kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 He said that is an unfortunate situation
 ham ummid karte hai ki uparajyapal, mukhyamantri or kendriya grahamantri milakar kaam karenge
 As the leader of the IAS officers' union, no one has been called wrong or right
 jabaki ve saaf-saaf kah sakate the ki koun galat he
 He also condemned the officer for making public accusations
 raashtrapati se milane ke baad rajnath singh ne bhi yahi kaha ki donon paksh milakar sulajhaa len
 His point should have been respected at least by the Lt
 Governor as the representative of the Center
 ulta jang ji ne pehle ke tabadale radd kar diye
 The Chief Minister should also fight this battle with restraint and dignity
 zaahir he raajnneeti ho rahi he or ladaai bhi
 In a democracy, some questions are of principle and law, which are kept closely and patiently among the public
 kejariwal sarkaar supreme court se niyamon or adhikaron par spashtataa maang sakati he
 This is the only way left in this case
 raashtrapati ke paas yah maamla to pahunchaa lekin vahaan se abhi koi raay nahin ai he
 Both sides have said as much as they wanted to say in public
 sawaal yah nahin he ki koun sahi he
 The big question is what is right
 kya kisi bhi vyavastha main chune hue mukhyamantri ke adhikari kii tainaati yaa tabadale kaa adhikaar centre ke namit pratinidhi kaa hona chahie? There has been a lot of confusion about Delhi, so every Chief Minister has demanded full state control by handing over control of police and land matters to them

 Both sides have said as much as they wanted to say in public
 sawaal yah nahin he ki koun sahi he
 The big question is what is right
 kya kisi bhi vyavastha main chune hue mukhyamantri ke adhikari kii tainaati yaa tabadale kaa adhikaar centre ke namit pratinidhi kaa hona chahie? Delhi has changed now
 kareeb do karod kii aabaadi vaale is rajya ko lambe samay tak nagarpalika se kuch adhik maatr kii sarkaar ke rup main nahin dekha ja saktaa
 The Constitution which has given Delhi the status of a Union Territory has not written anywhere that the arrangement being made for Delhi is final
 hairaani hui jab ise apurna yaa aparyaapt maan kar purna rajya kaa darja dene kii sabase lambii ladaai ladane vaali bijepi ne uparajyapal kaa paksh liya
 Perhaps the BJP could justify its old demand on the current controversy and take the line of limiting the rights of the Lieutenant Governor as other parties have taken
 ab bijepi bataati nahin thak rahi ki uparajyapal chune hue mukhyamantri se zyada shaktishaalee hai or samvidhan kii is vyavastha se sar takaraane se koi laabh nahin
 Even Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan's Swaraj Manch have not supported the Lt
 Governor on this issue
 das saal tak purna rajya kaa darja na dene ke sau bahaane karne vaali congress ne bhi uparajyapal kaa saath nahin diya he
 That Lt
 Governor was appointed by the Congress itself
 is vivaad ko aap pradhanmantri ke sahyogi sanghavaad ke najariye se dekhen to bijepi kii sakriyata hairaan karti he
 The Lieutenant Governor's hyperactivity is at the instigation of the Center or without it, but the prime minister's ally is against federalism
 ek mukhyamantri apni team nahin banayega to kaam kaise karegaa
 If someone else appoints and transfers his officers, will the Lieutenant Governor take accountability in the election
 janata ke bich jaakar kahenge ki mukhyamantri kii galati nahin he kyonki adhikariyon ko main chalaa rahaa tha
 When the Prime Minister can bring an ordinance and appoint a qualified officer for himself, then why can't the rules be changed in the interest of Delhi Government
 bhale hi purna rajya kaa darja na dena chahen magar ek chune hue pratinidhi ko apni team banane kaa buniyadi adhikaar to diya hi ja saktaa he
 Must be found
 galati kejariwal sarkaar se bhi hui he
 Not every fight in a democracy is a road
 ek adhikari par aarope lagaakar, ek adhikari ke kamare main taala band karnaa, uparajyapal ko agent bataakar nahin lard sakate
 By the way, the Chief Minister of every party has called the governors as agents
 unhen sadak se lekar court tak main ghasita he
 Many of these chief ministers have also become governors after retiring from politics! If Shakuntala Gamlin is an agent of a company, why was she not transferred from the post of Energy Secretary like the rest of the officers
 das din ke liye hui niyukti se kya ho jaataa? kya yah koi plan tha ki chuttee par gaye mukhya sachiv waapas hi na aaen or gamelin ko hi bana diya jaae
 These are all the apprehensions that whey will come out if churned in public
 lassi nahin
 The question of Shakuntala Gamlin being a woman is absurd
 us lihaaz se videsh sachiv ke pad se sujatha singh ko pradhanmantri hataa hi nahin sakate the jabaki unke ritair hone main saat maheene baaki the
 The question of injustice was not associated with a woman then
 sujatha singh ne apana sammaan bachaane ke liye istifa de diya or iees adhikariyon ke sangh ne baithak bhi nahin kii jaise is vivaad ke sandarbh main kii
 When the collectors of Chhattisgarh received notice on wearing glasses, then Omesh Saigal did not hold a meeting till late night and did not share Sardar Patel's statement
 ek sawaal or zahan main aata he
 Why did the Lieutenant Governor not intervene when Delhi Commission officer Ashish Joshi was removed
 tab kya mukhyamantri ne uparajyapal se manzuri lee thi
 Therefore, caution and equal distance should be maintained on both sides
 tippaniyan The statement of former Delhi Secretary Omesh Sehgal is significant after the IAS Union meeting
 unhone kaha ki durbhagyapurna sthiti he
 We hope that the Lieutenant Governor, the Chief Minister and the Union Home Minister will work together
 iees afasar sangh ke netaa ke taur par kisi ek ko galat yaa sahi nahin kaha
 While they could clearly tell who is wrong
 unhone adhikari par saarvajanik aarope lagane kii ninda bhi kii
 After meeting the President, Rajnath Singh also said that both sides should resolve together
 unki baat kaa sammaan kam se kam centre ke pratinidhi ke taur par uparajyapal ko karnaa chahie tha
 On the contrary, Jung Ji canceled the earlier transfers
 mukhyamantri ko bhi sanyam or maryaada ke saath is ladaai ko jamkar ladanaa chahie
 Obviously, politics is happening and fighting is also taking place
 loktantr main kuch sawaal saidhantik or kanoon ke hote hai jinhen baariki or sabar ke saath janata ke bich rakhaa jaataa he
 The Kejriwal government may seek clarity on the rules and rights from the Supreme Court
 is maamle main ab yahi rasta bachaa he
 The matter came to the President, but no opinion has come from there
 donon pakshon ne public main jitna kahana tha kah liya he
 The question is not who is right
 bada sawaal he ki kya sahi he
 Should the appointment or transfer of an officer of the chosen Chief Minister be delegated to a designated representative of the Center in any system? qaayade se maujuuda vivaad par bijepi apni puraani maang ke auchity ko majbooti se rakh sakati thi or uparajyapal ke adhikaron ko simit karne kii line le sakati thi jaisi baaki dalon ne lee he
 Now the BJP is not tired of saying that the Lieutenant Governor is more powerful than the elected Chief Minister and there is no benefit in hitting the head with this system of constitution
 yahaan tak ki yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan ke swaraj manch ne bhi is mudde par up rajyapal kaa saath nahin diya he

 How will work if a chief minister does not make his team

 Both sides have said as much as they wanted to say in public

 The big question is what is right
 kya kisi bhi vyavastha main chune hue mukhyamantri ke adhikari kii tainaati yaa tabadale kaa adhikaar centre ke namit pratinidhi kaa hona chahie? The Congress, which made excuses for not giving full statehood for ten years, has also not supported the Lieutenant Governor
 us uparajyapal kaa jisaki niyukti congress ne hi kii thi
 If you look at this controversy from the perspective of the Prime Minister's associate federalism, then the activism of BJP is surprised
 uparajyapal kii ati sakriyata centre kii shah par ho yaa bina shah ke lekin pradhanmantri ke sahyogi sanghavaad ke kilaaf to he hi
 How will work if a chief minister does not make his team
 uske adhikariyon kii niyukti or tabadalaa koi or karegaa to kya chunaav main uparajyapal javabdehi lenge
 It will go out among the public and say that it is not the Chief Minister's fault because i was driving the officials
 jab pradhanmantri adhyadesh laakar apane liye yogya adhikari kii niyukti kar sakate hai to dilli sarkaar ke hit main niyamon ko kyon nahin badla ja saktaa
 Even if you do not want to give full state status, a elected representative can be given the basic right to form his own team
 milanaa hi chahie
 The mistake has also happened to the Kejriwal government
 loktantr main har ladaai sadak kii nahin hoti
 By accusing an officer, locking in an officer's room, he cannot fight by telling the lieutenant governor as an agent
 vaise har dal ke mukhyamantri ne rajyapalon ko agent bataaya he
 They have been dragged from the road to the court
 inamen se kai mukhyamantri raajnneeti se ritair hone ke baad rajyapal bhi bane hai! agar shakuntla gamelin kisi company kii agent hai to unka urja sachiv ke pad se tabadalaa kyon nahin kiya gaya jaise baaki adhikariyon kaa kiya gaya
 What would happen with a ten-day appointment? Was it a plan that the Chief Secretary who was on leave should not return and make Gamlin the same
 yah sab ashankaayen hai jinhen saarvajanik rup se mathne par mattha hi nikalegaa
 Not lassi
 shakuntla gamelin ke mahila hone kaa sawaal betuka he

 Therefore, caution and equal distance should be maintained on both sides

 On 23 November, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor Arvind Kejriwal made two politically significant announcements after extending his tenure to the National Executive
 pehali yah ki aap 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav kii daud main nahin he
 Secondly, they have good news from Punjab
 party puraa dhyaan 2017 main rajya main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav par hi lagaaegi
 And why not? Kejriwal had longed for good news since the party was surrounded by an interruption after winning the Assembly elections in his native Delhi
 shaayad isi kalah kaa asar tha ki ve haryana jaise rajya tak main vidhansabha chunaav nahin lard sake, jise lekar party kaaphi ashanvit thi
 Not only this, by giving moral support to the Grand Alliance in the Bihar elections, he expressed that instead of trying himself in all the states, he is going to follow the strategy of supporting the third powers
 nitish kumaar ke shapath grahan samaaroh main gaiyr bijepi netaaon kii sangat or lalu prasad yadav se gale lagane ke baad kejariwal ab sabase jarkhez jameen punjab main siyaasi jhaadu chalaane ko taiyaar hai
 After all, Punjab was the only state in the Lok Sabha Elections 2014, which surprised everyone by giving 4 Lok Sabha seats to AAP
 dhamaakedaar chunavi aagaaj karte hue aap ne na sirf 24
 Had secured 5 per cent of the votes, but had made a dent of 8 and 7 per cent in the vote bank of two big powers of Punjab, Shiromani Akali Dal (badal) and Congress
 punjab main party kii taiyaariyon kii baangi malwa ilaake main najar aati he
 Kejriwal is seen smiling in the posters of the Aam Aadmi Party printed in village Gurmukhi script
 in ilaakon kaa kisaan kapaas kii fasal main keede lagane or dhan ke gire hue daam se halkaan he
 This is the second consecutive term of the Akalis in the power of the state and people have started asking them
 aise main ve badlaav kii baat kar rahe hai
 On one hand, he has the tried face of Congress, whose rein is seen in the hands of former Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who defeated BJP veteran Arun Jaitley in the Lok Sabha elections
 duusari taraf unke saamne aam aadmi party ke rup main ummiido kaa aisa ghoda he, jiskaa koi savaar philhal najar nahin aata
 In fact, after the Lok Sabha elections, the party went through a phase in which it had to suspend two of its four mps on charges of indiscipline and Bhagwant Mann, one of the remaining two mps, was facing notoriety due to a serious allegation like drunkenness
 Huh
 aise main party ne apni puri takat punjab ko jilaaye rakhane main lagaai he
 The trusted warlords of Delhi and other states have been thrown into the battle of Punjab
 disambar ke ant yaa janvari tak kejariwal khud bhi punjab kaa rukh kar sakate hai
 But in this strategy, like in Bihar, the issue of local and external is beginning to hit in Punjab
 party ke asantusht netaa pranav raay sawaal karte hai, ''sanghathan main badlaav ke baad party kaa 80 fisadi kaaryakarta ghar baith gaya he
 10 percent are with us and 10 percent with the party
 bahut-se netaa jo aap ke saath aae the, ab niskriy ho gaye hai or congress main sambhaavnaaen talash rahe hai
 However, the party's national spokesperson Ashutosh does not agree
 unki daleel he, ''puraane logon ko hataa diya gaya or nae logon ko laayaa gaya, jaisi koi baat nahin he
 People who have the ability to run the organization are given responsibilities
 har aadmi jo sanghathan ke andar he, vah sanghathan chalaa paae, yah jaruri nahin he
 Person-to-person meetings have been held with the workers of 117 assemblies
 isamen hue faisle ke aadhaar par hi logon ko jimmedaariyaan di gai hai
 "but people are only seeing Kejriwal, you don't have any Punjabi face in front?" "this is true to an extent," Ashutosh said
 punjab ke andar hamaara pehla kaam tha sanghathan ko majboot karnaa
 Until six months ago we had four mps in Punjab, there was enthusiasm among the people, but there was a lot of factionalism at the organization level
 aise main pehali jimmedaari yah thi ki sanghathan ke andar anushaasan ropit kiya jaae or sahi logon ko jimmedaari di jaae
 The work of the organization has been done to a great extent
 leadership ko aaidentifi kiya ja rahaa he
 At the time of election it will be thought who can proceed
 party ne yahaan kii kaman rajya ke prabharee sanjay singh ko saunp di he
 According to party sources, Sanjay has so far traveled more than 3,000 km
 iske alaava agast se 2 aktubar tak party ne yahaan 30 se zyada jansabhaayen kin
 In this way, the party has held one public meeting every three to four assemblies so far
 sanjay agar pradesh kaa daur kar rahe hai to party ke netaa durgesh pathak sanghathan kaa kaam dekh rahe hai
 Sucha Singh Chhotapur is the state coordinator of Punjab AAP, but Sanjay and Durgesh are more involved in the appointment of officials
 punjab main bahriyon kii bharmaar ke sawaal par chhotapur kehete hai, ''chunaav to punjab ke logon ko hi laduya he
 Experienced people have been called upon to make strategies and leverage their experience in the organization
 ''—party abhi se chunaav fund jamaa karne kii ranneeti par bhi kaam karne lagi he or uski najar khaas taur par canada or america ke pravasi punjabiyon par he
 The party has engaged Ashutosh and Kumar Vishwas in this work
 donon netaa kareeb 20 din tak donon deshon kaa daura kar chuke hai
 Here he met more than 200 NRI Punjabis
 party kii koshish he ki jis tarah videsh main baithe punjabiyon ne loksabhaa chunaav main unki madad kii thi, usee tarah ve log vidhansabha chunaav main bhi party ke saath aaen
 The party not only wants donations from these people, but also wants to take advantage of their personal influence in their villages and towns
 party yah bhi chaahati he ki kisi tarah punjab main behatar pradarshan kar vah waapas apane rashtiya agenda par laute, lekin punjab se pehle kam se kam aadha darjan rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai
 a year and a half is a very long time for India's crumbling political land

 However, after 1999, bjp-led NDA and Congress-led UPA coalition remained in government
 upie or endie (modi sarkaar kaa kaarykaal puraa hone vaala he) donon ne hi do-do baar paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa kiya

 The Congress supported it and HD Deve Gowda was made the Prime Minister
 sarkaar ko bane hue ek saal bhi puraa nahin hua tha or congress ne apana samarthan waapas le liya, sarkaar 324 din main hi gir gai
 After this, Janata Dal leader Indra Kumar Gujral was elected the leader of the coalition and with the support of the Congress he became the Prime Minister
 lekin vah bhi ek saal puraa na kar paae or 332 din hi pradhanmantri ke pad par kabiz rah sake

 The government says that through these figures it is identifying those people who should really get the benefit of government schemes
 surveykshan kii shuruyaat subah saat baje rajyabar main hui
 The house-to-house survey recorded beneficiary's name, age, educational qualification, occupation, Aadhaar card number, bank account number, property and other family information
 ek taraf jahaan aisi ashankaayen vyaapt hai ki surveykshan hyderabad main rahane vaale andhra pradesh ke nivaasiyon ko alag-thalag karne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he, vahiin iske vipareet is surveykshan main labhaarthi ke rihaayash kaa kollam shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 For this process, the government today declared a holiday in the state which affected normal life in Telangana

 Road Transport Corporation (RTC) buses were off the roads

 Telangana people across the country had reached their cities and villages to be part of this survey

 Perhaps the current chairman's credibility is not that level compared to its earlier presidents
 lekin isse bhi mahatvapurn he kaabiliyat
 Without knowing them you cannot say whether they are capable or not
 is mukaam par chouhan is maamle main anjaan-se shaks hai
 Therefore, it is unjust and sad that you should decide on such a person only because he is nominated for a particular post
 isi vajah se aap uski ninda karen or kaam kaa mauka die bagaiyr use suuli par chadha den! philhal sari bahes sirf saakh par kendrit he, yogyata or kaabiliyat kii to baat hi nahin uthi he
 In the matter of this appointment, you can only consider whether the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has done extensive investigation before selection
 Information received on two applications under the Right to Information Act shows that the Ministry has not done so

 The students should have called the nominated president and given them a chance to answer their questions
 main is santhaan kaa do baar (1980-83 or 1989-92) adhyaksh rah chukaa hum
 The Speaker is not there to rectify the examination papers
 nideshak ke ulat, use campus main rahane or santhaan ke rosemara ke kaamkaaj kii nigaraanee nahin kerani hoti
 The chairman is the leader of the FTII Society, which has autonomy of functioning
 uski duusari badi jimmedaari apatiai prashasnic parishad kii baithkon kii adhyakshata karne kii he
 Between the responsibilities of the FTII Society and the Administrative Council, it also has to see which direction the institute is going
 use dekhnaa hota he ki kahin santhaan maanakon se bhatak to nahin rahaa he or usamen sudhaar ke liye kya kiya ja saktaa he? kya uske course vartmaan or bhavishya kii jaruraton ko puraa kar rahe hai or ye samakaleen prakriyaaon ke anuroop hai yaa nahin?santhaan ke bhagavakaran ko lekar ho-halle main kuch atishyokti bhi he
 Can a film be painted saffron at the time of editing? Actually, when you make a film, ideology is embedded in its plot
 use mashin se shaamil nahin kiya ja saktaa
 This apprehension may be relevant in the case of institutions where subjects such as philosophy, history, economics and political science are taught, where a different view is formed from a particular ideology
 aap apatiai main kya kar sakate hai? aap sirf yahi kar sakate hai ki kisi chaatr ko uski diploma film ke maamle main is aadhaar par paas yaa fail kar den ki “vichaardhaara sahi nahin he
 "but this is ridiculous aap kisi bhi cheez kii vyakhya vichaardhaara ke hisaab se ek yaa duusare tareeke se kar sakate hai
 We have every right to do this under our constitution
 ham apana rajnatik najariya apni pasand ke hisaab se dakshinpanth, vampanth yaa madhya maarg yaa phir party ke aadhaar par bana sakate hai
 Similarly, the Chairman and the Director also have the right to maintain their views
 lekin, agar adhyaksh apni vichaardhaara mere gale se neeche utaarne kii koshish karata he to main virodh bhi kar saktaa hum
 i also got this right from the constitution, like students have the right to strike
 jab main 1981 main adhyaksh bana to vahaan hadtaal thi
 The students surrounded me
 noujvaan hone ke naate chaatro kii chintaaen badi hoti hai or unka samaadhaan na ho to unhen lagata he ki duniya lut jaaegi
 i proposed to the students that we all sit down (union leaders and the entire student union) to discuss the problems
 us samay meraa yah samaadhaan tha or mujhe lagata he ki is maamle main bhi yahi sabase munasib samaadhaan he
 The stance on both sides is stricter but usually the stance of management is more stringent
 saamaanya ravaiya yah hota haih “main paisa kharch karata hum isliye meraa sikaa chalanaa chahie
 "if anyone disapproves of this attitude, everyone starts saying yes to it
 ateet main aisi sarkarein rahi hai jinhone sawaal uthaaya ki “ham aise logon ke liye riyayati dar par shiksha kyon muhaiyaa karaaen? ve cinema kii padhai karnaa chaahate hai to nijee sansthaanon main ja sakate hai?” mere hisaab se yah koi jawaab nahin he
 FTII provides equal opportunities to every citizen of the country because this is the democratic way
 ham bataur raashtra apane logon ko manviki, vigyaan or praudyogiki gyaan dene ko tatpar or sakasham hai, bhale ve iske liye bhugtan karne ke kaabil na hon
 So it is irrational that we are spending so much money on every student, so how can they dare to do so? Take them out
 ”santhaan kii apni ahmiyat he
 This has greatly improved the technical and aesthetic standards of Indian cinema
 agar aap apatiai ke film shiksha muhaiyaa karaane se pehle kii filmon ko dekhen to aap paaenge ki filmon kii takneekee, saundaryashastra or kathankon main sudhaar hua he
 Today Indian films compete with the rest of the world
 iskaa shrey apatiai ko he
 My advice is not to "fight", but to "talk"
 jab aap baat karte hai to dusron kii sunate bhi hai
 There is no question of losing credit by doing so
 har kisi ko apane adigalapan ko chhodkar baat kerani chahie or hal nikaalane kii koshish kerani chahie
 If both sides remain adamant, then it is natural that the government will win
 unke naram-se dikhte chehre ke bheetar kathor iraade chupe hote hai
 This is neither correct, nor democratic

 Now various factions of KC are like political private limited companies owned by families
 muslim lig bhi isi tarah hi ek company he, haalanki yah kisi ek parivaar ke swaamitv main nahin he
 The Panakkad Thangal family is headed by its nominal head, while it is entirely a group business
 yah sab kuch ek kaarobaar he
 The communal card is like an ATM card

 They want it to look like secular

 yahi vajah he ki esandipi (shri narayan dharm paripaalan sangham) ke pramukh velapalli natesan ko apane farmaan ke mutabik isiv logon ke vot dalwane main mushkil hoti he
 They compensate millions of people by running the SNDP like a family establishment and are happy with their icon image created by the media which is very boastful

 Certainly, bishops can have control over many affluent institutions, property and spiritual matters of a large group
 lekin unka yah adhikaar chunaavon main nahin chalata
 Older women also vote according to their choice
 esandipi or eneses kii tarah bishap log bhi netaaon ke haathon main khelte hai
 Communalism in Kerala does not usually take a violent form, but is devious and explosive

 Pawar, addressing a rally at Hingna near Nagpur, said his party welcomed the withdrawal of the provision of Article 370, but the BJP is using it to target the opposition
 pavaar ke bayaan par palatwaar karte hue shah ne kaha ki unki party rashtriya suraksha se jude mudde uthaati rahegi
 Please tell that Sharad Pawar said in Hingna, 'no one can get votes by repeatedly raising Pulwama (terrorist attack) and Article 370

 Today, BJP leaders are asking us our thoughts about this
 ' isse pehle shah ne brihaspativaar ko poocha tha ki pavaar or congress netaa rahul gandhi anuchhed 370 ke praavdhaan haatane ke paksh main hai yaa virodh main? is par pavaar ne kaha, 'sansad ne anuchhed hataaya
 Only four-five people opposed it
 iskaa virodh karne waalon ne kaha tha ki faisla liya ja saktaa he, lekin pehle kashmir ke logon ko bharose main liya janaa chahie
 'he said,' But today the leaders of the ruling party are not telling what they are doing to solve the basic problems of common people
 Instead, they are criticizing the opposition by raising the issue of Article 370
 'unhone kaha, 'narendra modi sarkaar samvidhan kaa anuchhed 371 hataane kaa saahas kyon nahin dikhaati, jo bharat ke anya hisson ke logon ko purvottar rajyon main jameen kharidne se roktaa he
 He said, 'you removed Article 370, why wouldn't you have shown courage to remove 371? We will support you
 
 
 vah (bhaajapa) 370 or pulavama ke naam par logon ko gumraah kar rahi he
 On the other hand, Shah hit back at Pawar at a rally in Kilari in Latur, saying that national security and Article 370 were "important" issues for the BJP
 bhaajapa adhyaksh ne kaha, 'sharad pavaar or congress ke netaaon ne mujhase poocha ki anuchhed 370 ekmaatr mudda he

 He asked me to assess his game and give him some advice

 One specialty of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is that he speaks less and sometimes he does not speak even when needed

 In the elections of five states, we saw that the conceit of the Congress was shattered

 From florists to mareweeders, all demand cash and are not ready to change

 The houses where there is a marriage and even lack of holiday notes, they do not understand, go to the bank to get the notes changed or attend wedding ceremonies

 At the same time, female music is going on with great pomp about Alok Gupta's wedding, but her father has to struggle a lot if the show does not get gritty

 pakistan ke midl order lefti ballebaaj imam-ul-haq ne ek intervyuu main apana dard ke dil bayaan kiya he
 Imam ul Haq said that in recent years an image of him has been carved out, which has reinforced aspects of misconception of nepotism and lack of understanding of a complex or difficult character
 imam ne kaha ki chhavi aisi garh di gai he ki mahatvakanksha or bhaawanaaon ko galati se ahankaar samaj liya gaya he
 imam-ul-haq has generally been criticized more for the aspect that whatever position he has received is due to his uncle and former chief selector Inzamam Ul Haq

 The Imam says that this thing strikes me very much
 imam-ul-haq ne kaha ki main chahta hum ki log yaa meri aalochana karne vaale jaane ki asal imam-ul-haq koun hai
 This is a purpose which the Imam keeps repeating again and again

 i am an emotional person
 main ek aakraamak shakhsiyat hum, jo logon ko jawaab dena chahta hum
 He said that when Pakistan loses, he cries a lot
 agar log babar ajam, yasir shah yaa mohammad aamir kii aalochana karte hai, to unhen bahut hi pidaa hoti he
 i feel sad when it is said that i have been able to play so much cricket because of my uncle's behavior
 imam ne kaha ki main jaanata hum ki is team main hona kitna zyada mushkil he or kitni mushkilen hamen team main bane rahane ke liye sahani padati hai
 i know that people love us
 jab ham jite hai, to prashansak duniya se baahar ke log dikhaai padate hai, lekin hamen is tathy par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hota he ki yah sirf khel he
 This is not war

 Former India captain Rahul Dravid wants an arrangement in which the world's best cricketers can play for their country in Test cricket as well as play the Indian Premier League
 pichley ipel main rajasthan royles ke captain rahe dravid ne kaha, mujhe iskaa hal pataa nahin he, lekin main chahta hum ki duniya ke sarvshereshth cricketer ipel or test cricket donon khel saken
 "players like Chris Gayle and Kevin Pietersen are great cricketers of Tests and T20s," he said
 unhen apni pratibha dikhaane ke puure maukey milane chahie
 Dravid said, after all, this game is for the audience only
 sarvshereshth khilaadi apane desh ke liye khelen
 This is not only for the spectators coming to the ground, but also for the youth who like Test cricket
 yadi sarvshereshth cricketer desh ke liye nahin khele, to yah bahut niraashajanak hota he
 He said that a formula should be made for this
 england or dakshin africa ke bich lords par tisare test ke dauraan bibisi ke test match special ne dravid ke hawaale se kaha, yah sach he ki ipel ahm he or log ise dekhnaa chaahate hai
 He said, a time will come when 'give and Take' will be necessary
 yaa to ipel ke liye windo banani hogi yaa toornament chota karnaa hoga
 Dravid said a solution to this is necessary, as the IPL dates will continue to collide with the start of the England cricket season and the exclusion of big names like Pietersen and Chris Gayle is not in favor of Test cricket
 emsisi cricket samiti kii baithak main hissaa lene ke liye landan main maujuud dravid ne kaha, ipel ke saath kuch sakaaratmak chijen judi hui hai or aapako yah samajhnaa hoga ki agar duniya bhar ke sheersh khilaadi isamen khelnaa chaahate hai or log ise dekhnaa chaahate hai, to isamen kuch acha to hoga hi
 The comments dravid ne kaha, isse vishesh taur par england kaa satr prabhavit hoga, kyonki england kaa satr paaramparik taur par pichley kai varshon se ek hi samay shuru hota he
 So it is a bit challenging
 samay aane par ham aise charan main pahunch jaaenge, jahaan sabhi chahenge ki sarvshereshth khilaadi (test cricket) khelen
 Dravid said, we all want Chris Gayle to play on his behalf whenever the West Indies play a Test match
 ham main se koi bhi aisi sthiti kaa saamana nahin karnaa chahta, jisase kevin petersan jaisaa diggaj khilaadi team se baahar ho, phir kaaran chaahe jo bhi ho or kaarnon par baat nahin karnaa chahta, lekin yah niraashajanak he
 When the top players don't play Test cricket, it only hurts the game
 unhone kaha, kris gail or kevin petersan jaise khilaadi test or tii-20 ke behtareen cricketer hai
 They should get full opportunities to showcase their talent
 dravid ne kaha, aakhirkaar yah khel darshakon ke liye hi he
 Play the best players for your country
 yah sirf maidan main aane vaale darshakon kii nahin, balki test cricket pasand karne vaale yuvaaon ke liye bhi he
 It is very disappointing if the best cricketers do not play for the country
 unhone kaha ki iske liye ek formula banaaya janaa chahie
 During the third Test at Lord's between England and South Africa, bbc's Test Match Special quoted Dravid as saying that it is true that the IPL is important and people want to watch it
 unhone kaha, ek aisa samay aayega, jab 'give and tech' jaruri hoga
 Either a window has to be created for the IPL or the tournament will have to be shortened
 dravid ne kaha ki iskaa samaadhaan jaruri he, kyonki ipel kii tareekhen england ke cricket satr kii shuruyaat ke saath takaraati rahengi or petersan tathaa kris gail jaise bade naamon kaa baahar hona test cricket ke paksh main nahin he
 Dravid, who was in London to attend the MCC Cricket Committee meeting, said, "there are some positive things associated with the IPL and you have to understand that if the top players from all over the world want to play in it and people want to see it, then There must be something good in it
 tippaniyan Dravid said, this would especially affect the England season, as the England season traditionally starts at the same time for the past several years
 isliye yah thodaa chunauteepurn he
 When the time comes, we will reach a stage where everyone would like to play the best player (test cricket)
 dravid ne kaha, ham sabhi chaahate hai ki westeindies jab bhi test match khele, to kris gail uski ore se khelen
 None of us want to face a situation where a veteran player like Kevin Pietersen is out of the team, whatever the reason may be and does not want to talk about the reasons, but it is disappointing
 jab sheersh khilaadi test cricket nahin khelte hai, to isse khel ko hi nuksaan hota he

 Punjab Congress President Amarinder Singh has made his stand clear on the speculation of former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu joining the Congress
 amarinder ne kaha he ki unhen siddhu or aawaaj-e-punjab ke anya netaaon ke congress main shaamil hone ko lekar kisi tarah kii aapatti nahin he
 According to Amarinder, he has always said that Sidhu and other leaders are welcome in the party on their faith in the Congress leadership and its policies
 amarinder ne kaha ki wo nahin jaanate ki ye sawaal unase baar-baar kyon poocha ja rahaa he
 Amarinder said, in fact it was me who had said at the time of Sidhu leaving the BJP that he should join Congress
 chaahe siddhu hon yaa bains bandhu yaa phir pargat singh, meri party ke daravaaje sabake liye khule hai
 Amarinder said that these are all those people whose roots are in the Congress and they cannot stay away for much longer than this
 punjab pradesh congress adhyakshane kaha ki unka is mudde par rukh hameshaa se bahut saaf rahaa he
 The interests of the party are at the top and if the party is strengthened by the arrival of like-minded people, then any such development will benefit us
 bataa den ki amarinder kai baar kah chuke hai kipunjab chunaavako lekar siddhu yaa unke morche se kisi tarah kii koi baat nahin chal rahi
 On the other hand, voice-e-punjab member and Independent MLA Simarjit Singh had earlier claimed that Sidhu is in touch with the Congress high command for an alliance
 siddhu ko lekar amarinderke bayanon main badlaav aate rahe hai
 First he said that there is Congress in Sidhu's DNA, then he called awaaz-e-punjab as Tanga Party
 siddhu ne pichley maheene rajyasabha seat or bijepi se istipha dene ke baad aawaaj-e-punjab kaa gathan kiya tha
 But he has not yet announced to join hands with any party
 jabase adityanath uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri bane hai, tabase har ore unki hi charchaa he
 People want to know everything about them
 chaahe baat unke khanpan kii ho yaa phir unke kaam karne ke tareeke kii, unke itihaas kii ho yaa vivaadit bayanon kii, ab to ve hi charchaa main hai
 As a result of this, after his becoming Chief Minister last month, the youth are looking desperate to join the Hindu Yuva Vahini
 ye vahi sanstha he, jisase khud yogi adityanath jude hue hai
 Dress code for officers in Yogi Raj? Notice given on wearing jeans-t-shirt, if the figures are considered, then this institution is receiving more than 5 thousand applications daily
 ye aavedan sanstha main shaamil hone ke liye hai
 It is worth noting that earlier the institute used to get 500 to 1,000 applications per month
 lekin achaanak hui is badhottaree ke baad sanstha ne pravesh ke liye nae maanak tay kar die hai
 Hindu Yuva Vahini's Office in Charge said in an interaction with Indian Express, "we are checking the background of every candidate and verification is also being done whether he is associated with any political party or not
 'ab sanstha ne apane sabhi jilon ke karyaalayon main notification bhej diya he ki ve kisi ko bhi sanstha se jodne se pehle behad saavdhaanee baraten
 According to the new rule, now the applicant's voter ID card, Aadhaar will also be checked for taking membership
 pehle sanstha ke saath judane ke liye 11 rupye liye jate the lekin ab ise free kar diya gaya he or ab keval online aplications hi sweekaar kii ja rahi hai
 Explain that this institution calls itself a cultural and social institution which is dedicated to Hinduism and nationalism

 The situation is that despite the threat of contempt and contempt of the Supreme Court for making Lokpal, the government is doing it right-left

 In this advertisement, Kamal Nath is giving a loan waiver certificate to a woman and the woman is blessing her by placing her hand on the cm's head
 yahaan tak to sab thik tha, lekin is vigyaapan main kamalnath or labhuk mahila ke alaava ek or vyakti kaa haath dikh rahaa tha
 With this hand, this picture started to go viral

 congress ne jari kii puri phototasvir jab viral hone lagi to congress ko puri photo jari kerani padi
 When the Congress revealed the full truth of the photo printed in the newspaper, it was found that the hand in the picture is that of Cabinet Minister Kamleshwar Patel, who is holding the certificate from the bottom to give the CM
 congress samarthak ne bheji 'bhagavadagita'jab soshal media main viral tasviir kaa puraa sach saamne aayaa to congress samarthak or netaa shivaraj ko trol karne lage

 The Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' on Thursday has credited itself with the government's withdrawal of Mumbai's development plan and also praised the Fadnavis government for patting the government on its footback
 shivasena ne 'saamana' main likhaa he ki sarkaar dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye vikaas plan main 10 hajaar galtiyaan thi or isse mumbai waalon kaa koi vikaas nahin ho saktaa tha
 If the Shiv Sena believed that the development plan prepared by the people of the government was ready, along with the 'metro' train would run from the chests of the farmers of Girgaum and thousands of families would have to be displaced
 iske saath hi is vikaas yojana kii vajah se 'aare' kii hariyaali par cement kaa jangal khadaa honevaala tha
 However, due to the pressure coming from all sides, the government has backtracked its development plan and once again asked to change the mistake made in it
 shivasena ne vikaas mudde ko lekar khud ko shrey detaa hue likhaa he, 'shivasena ne mukhyamantri kaa darwaja khatkhataya, jiske baad hi vikaas yojana ke peeche kaa sach saamne laayaa
 After this, the government put the scheme in the stove
 ''saamana' ne mukhyamantridevendra fadanviski tarif main likhaa he ki bhale hi mukhyamantri nagpur ke he, lekin unhen mumbai ke sawaalon kii acchhee samaj he
 If the 'saamana' is believed, then the Mumbai Municipal Corporation will only pick up the garbage, talk about air and water and the center gets eight out of the money
 'saamana' ne is dauraan ek sawaal bhi khadaa kiya he
 When faced with the face, when the Prime Minister brought the Japanese company to Varanasi to purify the Ganges, we do not want their money, we have only been demanding the right to Mumbai for so many years

 The bench said, 'we direct that the power supply companies like Delhi Government, Delhi Jal Board, all Municipal Corporations, Cantonment Boards, BSES and all the body authorities to get environmental compensation from every family producing sewage in the entire National Capital Region of Delhi Will have to be paid
 ’ peeth ne kaha ki bhukhndon par hue nirmaan ke sandarbh main is kshatipurti kii raashi sambandhit adhikari tay karenge or vah dilli sarkaar ke paas jamaa hogi

 (input: bhashaa) Concerned over the deteriorating air quality in Delhi and the National Capital Region, the Supreme Court today began to explore the possibility of directing the Center not to suspend and renew licenses for firecrackers in the capital, to store and sell them
 pradhan nyaayadhish tirath singh thakur, nyaayamurti e ke sikari or nyaayamurti es e bobade kii teen sadasyeey khandpeeth ne kaha ki vah is mudde par kadam dar kadam aage badhegi kyonki ye pataakhe ab jivan kaa hissaa ban chuke hai or iske bare main tarksangat aadesh kii aavashyaktaa he taaki ise lagu kiya ja sake
 Keeping the order in the matter, the bench said, "be patient
" yah ek hi raat main nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 We will do whatever is better for the country and Delhi
 hamaare dwaara diya gaya koi bhi aadesh tarksangat hona chahie taaki ise lagu kiya ja sake
 When the bench was informed that a large number of firecrackers are fired during the marriage and festive seasons, the bench said, "if we ban the firecrackers, every firecracker that bails will violate our order
" ham sabhi pahaluon par vichaar karke hi simit avadhi ke liye antarim aadesh denge
 The court said that it is considering passing an order that no new license will be given now and the existing license will not be renewed or we can direct the Center to suspend the existing license of Delhi and National Capital Region
 Issue an order to do
 tippaniyan The bench said it would not pass any final order without taking into consideration detailed research on firecrackers in this case and its impact on air quality, health and lifestyle

 ) kuch logon ke liye unke dost hi sab kuch hote hai
 They cannot even imagine their world without friends
 unke liye doston kaa hona sabase ahm hota he
 But many times, his partner does not like this attention received by his friends
 kai baar ek partner ko lagata he ki uske saathi ke doston kii vajah se unki personal life par asar pad rahaa he
 This dislike gradually starts turning into hatred and it directly affects your relationship
 isse pehle ki yah sthiti kharaab ho, ise samay rahete sambhaal lene kii jarurat hoti he
 If your partner is also excessively sensitive to his friends and you feel that his behavior is causing trouble for you, then you can find a solution to this problem in these ways: 1
 apni soch main badlaav laane kii koshish karen
 You should also try to understand your partner's thinking
 ho saktaa he ki apane partner kii sthiti jaanane ke baad aapaki soch main kuch badlaav aa jaae
 2
 aapako partner ko spes dena chahie
 Always remember that it is not prudent to leave any other relationship in order to maintain any relationship and arguing on this issue with you will only harm you
 3
 The best solution to this problem is to sit and talk with your partner
 use yah samajhane kii koshish karen ki aapako bhi uskaa paryaapt samay chahie
 But don't forget to say that you do not like to be surrounded by friends forever
 is baat se aap donon ke sambandhon par asar pad saktaa he
 4
 aise maamle main aapako samajhadaari se kaam lene kii jarurat he
 Try to spend quality time together, both of you, that is quality time
 aisa nahin hona chahie ki aap donon saath main hone ke baavjood ek-duusare se jhagadkar baithe hon
 5
 aise samay main jarurat he ki aap dhairya se kaam len
 If you want, you can also make your partner's friends your friend
 aisa karne se aapaki ye shikaayat bhi dur ho jaaegi kyonki aap bhi un doston ke saath vakt bitaa saken
 6
 ye tarika puri tarah vigyaan ke sutara par aadhaarit he
 If you want, you can start being busy with your friends just like your partner

 newjiland ke khilaaf dilli main khele gaye duusare van-de match ke dauraan team india ke captain mahendra singh dhoni jab ballebaaji kar rahe the, tab match bharat ke haath main tha
 It was expected that Dhoni would win the match on his own, but Dhoni scored just 39 runs facing 65 balls and eventually India lost the match by 6 runs
 sabase badi baat yah thi ki dhoni kaa halke tareeke se out hona
 Not just this match, there are many matches in which India lost the match due to Dhoni's poor batting
 11 oktober 2015 ko south africa ke khilaaf hue pehle van-de match main dhoni kaa pradarshan kuch khaas nahin tha
 When Dhoni came to bat, India needed 90 runs in the last 60 balls, so it was expected that Dhoni would bat India to win
 lekin dhoni kaaphi slo khele
 Dhoni resorted to 17 balls to score the first ten runs
 dhoni ne is match main 30 gendon kaa saamana karte hue 31 banaae the or bharat paanch ran se match haar gaya tha
 Not only this, Dhoni's performance in the ODI match between India and South Africa on the ground of Rajkot on 18 October 2015 was quite poor
 dakshin africa ne pehle ballebaaji karte hue 270 ran banaae the
 Dhoni, who came to bat in the fourth position, played a very slow innings
 dhoni ne 61 gendon saamana karte hue sirf 47 ran banaae or bharat is match ko 23 ran se haar gaya
 The comments isse pehle bhi kuch maichon main finishr ke rup main dhoni kaa pradarshan kharaab rahaa he
 Dhoni is also failing as a finisher in T20
 18 june 2016 ko zimbabwe ke khilaaf pehle tii-20 match main dhoni ne 17 gendon kaa saamana karte hue 19 ran banaae the or bharat is match ko sirf do ran se haar gaya tha
 Even during the IPL match, Dhoni played some slow innings, due to which his team had to face defeat
 har match main shandaar khelte hue team ko jeet dilaanaa kisi bhi khilaadi ke liye sambhav nahin he, lekin dhoni ke andar aatmavishvaas kii kami dikhaai dene lagi he
 Now when Dhoni bats, it seems that he is playing a lot of pressure
 ho saktaa he ki is dawaab kii vajah dhoni vifal ho rahe hai

 Even before this, Dhoni's performance as a finisher in some matches has been poor
 tii-20 main bhi finishr ke rup main dhoni vifal ho rahe hai
 On 18 June 2016, in the first T20 match against Zimbabwe, Dhoni scored 19 runs, facing 17 balls and India lost the match by just two runs
 ipel match ke dauraan bhi dhoni ne kuch dhimi paariyaan kheli thim, jisaki vajah se unki team ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 It is not possible for any player to win the team by playing brilliantly in every match, but there is a lack of confidence in Dhoni
 ab jab dhoni ballebaaji karte hai to aisa lagata he ki vah kaaphi dawaab main khel rahe hai
 It is possible that Dhoni is failing due to this pressure
 har match main shandaar khelte hue team ko jeet dilaanaa kisi bhi khilaadi ke liye sambhav nahin he, lekin dhoni ke andar aatmavishvaas kii kami dikhaai dene lagi he

 mahaj akshar bhar ke gyaan ke baavjood unhen puraa ramcharita maanas kanthsth tha
 Leaving a job, formed a Ramlila troupe
 -in early life, the beggar Thakur left his home and village for food and went to Kharagpur
 kuch vakt tak vah roji roti main lage rahe
 It is said that during this period he did not leave his ancestral traditional occupation for almost thirty years, but later the beggar Thakur returned to his village and formed a dance troupe of folk artists and began to perform Ramlila with them

 The genius of his talent was that Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan called him an 'ungrateful diamond', while Jagdishchandra Mathur said 'artist of the tradition of Bharata Muni'
 bhojpuri ke naatak 'beti bechwa', 'gabar ghichor' aaj bhi prachlit5-unke nirdesan main bhojpuri ke naatak 'beti bechwa', 'gabar ghichor', 'beti viyog' kaa aaj bhi bhojpuri anchal main manchan hota rahata he
 Through these plays and films, the beggar Thakur made a tremendous contribution towards social reform

 Assembly elections are due in Uttar Pradesh in 2017, in view of which all the political parties are busy trying to get votes by campaigning wholeheartedly
 bijepi ko chhod den to baaki sabhi partiyon kaa dhyaan khaastaur se muslim vot saadhane par laga hua he
 In such a situation, the BSP, playing the Dalit card so far, has been trying to break into the traditional Muslim vote bank of the SP
 bahujan samaaj party kii supremeo mayawati ne haal hi main kanshiram kii punyatithi par raily kar apane iraade bilkul saaf kar die
 He appealed to the Muslims not to spoil their vote by voting for the SP or else the BJP could benefit in this election
 itnaa hi nahin unhone rajya ke musalamaanon se chunaav ke dauraan gumraah na hone kii bhi apil kii
 Mayawati has been eyeing Muslim votes from the beginning this time, which can be gauged from the fact that the BSP has distributed 100 tickets to Muslim candidates
 vahiin party main do muslim netaaon nasimuddin siddiki or munakad ali ko badi jimmedaariyaan saunpi gai he
 Talking about the ruling party of the state, the Samajwadi Party government has lost popularity in the Muslims after the killings in Muzaffarnagar and Bishara of Dadri
 jis tarah se rajya main musalamaanon ke saath ho rahi choti-badi ghatnaon par sarkaar ne wo kirdaar adaa nahin kiya jo usko karnaa chahie tha
 Non-use of law and order continued to promote such incidents
 vahiin muaavje ke alaava akhilesh sarkaar ne in ghatnaon par koi badi ghoshnaa nahin kii iske chalate musalmaan votaron kaa sapa se mohabhang hone laga he
 The government should not take any strict action on these incidents, it may be overshadowed in this time assembly elections
 sargical strike ke baad uttar pradesh membhartiya janata partika jaadu chalane kii baat kahi ja rahi he
 In UP, the BJP is eyeing the Brahmin vote bank
 lekin musalamaanon ko saadhane ke liye piem kabhi-kabhi bayaanbaji se gurej nahin karte
 Recently, PM Modi said that 'muslims should not be seen as a market of votes
 unke saath nafrat nahin, apano jaisaa vyavhaar karne kii jarurat he
 'while PM Modi is engaged in increasing proximity to Muslims on one hand, his party is running on a different line
 musalamaanon kii sud lekar antarrashtriya str par apni chhavi sudhaarney kii koshish main lage piem modi ke diggaj netaa unki koshishon par aksar pani pherate rahe hai
 In addition to smoldering the issues of beef and cow protection, provocative statements by BJP leaders like Yogi Adityanath, Sakshi Maharaj and Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti have caused fear and anger among the Muslims of UP
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi haal hi main upi se kisaan yatra karke laute hai
 During this time, he not only visited the Hanuman Garhi temple to keep the Brahmin vote bank happy but also took care of Muslim vote bank and made a chadar at the dargah in Kichhocha
 is baat se ye to saaf ho hi jaataa he ki pehle kii tarah aaj bhi congress ek tarafa rukh apnaane se batch rahi he
 Neither she wants to take the pro-muslim status nor does she want to annoy the Hindu voters by creating a 'pro-muslim' image
 congress kii maujuuda haalat ko dekhte hue bhi muslim voter apane vot ko kharaab to nahin karnaa chahenge
 At the same time, the silence of Congress on issues like Muzaffarnagar and Dadri has served to dissuade Muslims from the party
 aise main maujuuda halaat is taraf ishaara karte hai ki agle saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main basapa muslim vot bank ko saadhane main kaamyaab sabit ho sakati he
 At the same time, old records also show that incidents of atrocities on Muslims and communal riots have not taken place during the BSP rule
 aise main musalmaan votaron ke liye basapa ummid kii kiran banakar upi chunaav main kamaal kar sakati he

 Congress spokesperson Rashid Alvi believes that the country's Muslims are decaying, but they avoid blaming anyone for it
 vah kehete hai ki iske liye kisi kii ore javabdehi kii ungali uthaa dene se samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hoga
 They believe that if any political party did anything for the development of Muslims after independence, it is the Congress
 vaise vah ise bhi naakaafi maanate hai or kehete hai abhi bhi bahut kuch karne kii jarurat he
 Alvi said in an interview that the conditions of Muslims in the country are not good
 aazaadee ke baad musalamaanon ke liye yadi kisi ne kuch kiya to vah congress party hi he, haalanki abhi bhi bahut kuch karne kii jarurat he jo kiya gaya he vah kaaphi nahin he
 In future, the Congress government will do a lot to uplift them
 yah puche jane par ki aakhir musalamaanon kii is badahaali ke liye javabdeh koun he? vah kehete hai ki javabdehi kii ungali uthaa dene se samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin ho jaataa
 Along with the government, the country's Muslims will also have to try to improve the situation
 musalamaanon ko sarkari madad kii jarurat he lekin saath-saath unhen upar uthne ke liye khud bhi koshish or mehnat kerani padegi
 On the ongoing debate about reservation for Muslims, Alvi said that this should have happened long ago
 desh main musalamaanon ke halaat achche nahin hai
 At present, reservation for Muslims can be made within 27 percent of the Other Backward Class (OBC) quota
 musalmaan matadaataaon ko aagaah karte hue unhone kaha ki desh kaa matadaata jab mat daalane jaataa he to vah birdari, dharm, rishtedaari ko aage rakhata he
 There is a need to change this mindset, especially among Muslims
 yadi log is sabase upar uthakar matdaan karenge to unke kshetra kaa to vikaas hoga hi, acchhee vidhansabha or sansad bhi gathit hogi or phir usase acchhee sarkarein bhi saamne aaengi
 On the electoral battle going on in Uttar Pradesh, Alvi says that the Congress does not do the politics of power, so they are confident that within the last 20-22 years, the caste politics of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which do politics of communalism, have understood the people of the state and this time they are showing the wisdom of development The rival Congress will impose its own
 vah kehete hai ki rahul gandhi badi takat ke saath uttar pradesh main prachaar kaary main lage hue hai
 Now his tour of Uttarakhand is about to begin
 unke prayaason se congress ko lagaataar phayda ho rahaa he
 We are expecting big changes in Uttar Pradesh by their efforts
 unheen kii vajah se sansadeey chunaav main congress badi takat banakar ubhari
 Alvi calls Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi a national leader
 vah kehete hai ki chunaav loktantr kaa hissaa hai
 It is wrong to say that they affect someone's future or his future politics
 hamen puri aashaa he paanchon rajyon main hamaara pradarshan shandaar hoga
 Congress government will be formed in these states
 rahul gandhi sirf in paanch rajyon ke netaa nahin hai, vah desh ke netaa hai
 Alvi Gandhians consider Anna Hazare as the mask of the Sangh
 unka kahana he ki bhaajapa va uske netaaon kii is desh main ab koi vishwasaneeyata nahin rah gai thi
 Nobody is willing to listen to them
 iske liye rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ko ek mukhute kii talash thi
 She has got this mask as Anna Hazare
 anna hajaare ko aage kar vah apane raajnneetik hit saadh rahe hai
 Alvi is disappointed with the decision to withdraw foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail sector
 vah is faisle ko desh hit main bataate hai
 He said that irrespective of the issue, the opposition always opposes, but FDI is the need of the country and the government will move forward on this issue by making consensus among all
 bollywood kii heroinon main in dinon on screen jarnlist banane kaa craij kuch zyada najar aa rahaa he yaa yun kahen ki bollywood is peshey ko apni filmon main khaas tavajjo dene laga he
 That's why Madhur Bhandarkar's media-produced film 'page 3', 'preeti Zinta' in 'lakshya', Kareena Kapoor in 'satyagraha' or Soha Ali Khan in Faraz Haider's first war comedy film 'war Chhod Na Yaar' , Everyone chose this role
 pataudi khandaan kii bitiyaa soha ali khan kii baat karen to apni bhabhi karina kapur ke nakshe kadam par chalate hue soha ne na sirf jarnlist kii bhoomika nibhaai he balki unase ek kadam aage badhakar war jarnlist rut datta kii mukammal tasviir pesh karne kii koshish kii
 However, many people still have doubts about how Soha, who is seen as a mimicry, finally made such a rough tuff profession come true on screen? Director Faraz Haider gave an answer to this question, "soha may be seen touching her body with her body, but the truth is that she is a very mature actor
" aap khud rang de basanti, mumbai meri jaan or khoyaa khoyaa chand jaisi filmein dekhie
 Soha's acting ability was excellent
 unke inhen gunon par gaur karte hue hamanen yah kirdaar soha ko saunpa he
