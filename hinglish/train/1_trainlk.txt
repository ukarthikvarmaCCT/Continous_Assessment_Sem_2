 ludhiana kii rahane vaali 20-varshiya renu jis vakt shaadi hone ke baad uttar pradesh ke usuri main aakar basii, use ek zordaar jhatka laga
 
 
 Her new home did not have a toilet, and she had to go to the open fields to cope
 
 
 renu kaa kahana tha, "jab tak meri shaadi nahin hui thi, main sochati thi 'shauchalay' to buniyadi zarurat or haq he
 
 
 i used to think that there is a toilet in the house
 
 
 lekin jab mere nae ghar main shauchalay nahi mila, tab mujhe uski ahmiyat kaa pataa chalaa
 
 
 " khayr, dedh saal tak sangharsh karne ke baad renu ko aakhirkaar nae ghar main bhi shauchalay mil gaya, or uski madad kii america piechdi chaatra marta vainduzar-snow ne, jo pichley teen saal se hindustan main hi rah rahi hai
 
 
 Renu said that girls in India have been living without toilets for many generations
 
 
 unhen shouch tathaa mutratyag ke liye dheron kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he, or bahut-bahut der tak us dabaav ko sharir main hi rokkar rakhana padataa he
 
 
 Marta vanduser-snow, raised in Boston, USA, is associated with the Rajiv Gandhi Women's Development Project here as a volunteer, and helping our country overcome this problem
 
 
 marta kaa maananaa he ki shauchalay moolbhoot adhikaar hona chahie, or ise sabhi ko milanaa chahie
 
 
 So far, she has built more than 100 low-cost evapotranspiration toilets in Usuri, Ayodhya's Purva, Zamindar's Purva and Dhakolia villages
 
 
 in dinon vah uttar pradesh ke ek or gramin hisse main 20 nae toilet banavaane ke liye kaam kar rahi hai
 
 
 Interestingly, the Evapotranspiration toilet built by Marta vanduzer-snow costs just Rs 9,978, while the cost of the toilet built by the government under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is around Rs 17,000
 
 
 marta ke kaam se labhanvit hue in gaanvon main in shauchalayon kaa nirmaan 'khule main shouch kii pravriti' kaa ant sabit hua he
 
 
 a villager from Usuri said, "it was my dream to build a toilet for my daughter
 
 
 mujhe is kaa bura lagata tha ki use khule main nivrutt hone janaa padataa tha, yaa dabaav ko bahut der tak rokkar rakhana padataa tha
 
 
 Now i am working with Marta, and helping her build more toilets in my village
 
 
 main yah sab paise ke liye nahin, apane parivaar or gaanv kii bhalaai ke liye kar rahaa hum
 
 
 " aap bhi dekhie, marta ke kaam ko lekar NDTV special projects team dwaara taiyaar kiya gaya ek video
 
 
 The comments ab hamen coment kar zarur bataaiga, kya is tarah kaa koi gaanv aapaki nazar main bhi he, jahaan ab khule main shouch ke liye janaa padataa he
 
 
 (click here to read more detail about Marta vanduzar-snow
 
 
 ) Renu said, "until i was married, i used to think that 'toilet' is a basic need and right
 
 
 main samajhati thi ki ghar main shauchalay hota hi he
 
 
 But when the toilet was not found in my new house, i realized its importance
 
 
 " Well, after struggling for a year and a half, Renu finally finds a toilet in the new house, and is helped by Marta vanduzar-snow, an American phd student who has been living in India for the past three years
 
 
 renu ne kaha ki bharat main ladkiyaan kai pidiyon se bina shauchalayon ke hi rahati aa rahi hai
 
 
 They have to face many difficulties for defecation and urination, and hold that pressure in the body for a very long time
 
 
 america ke boston main pali-badhin marta vainduzar-snow yahaan rajeev gandhi mahila vikaas pariyojna ke saath walantier ke taur par judi hui hai, or is samasya se nijaat paane main hamaare desh kii madad kar rahi hai
 
 
 Marta believes that toilets should be a fundamental right, and should be enjoyed by all
 
 
 ab tak vah usuri, ayodhya kaa purava, jimndaar kaa purava or dhakolia gaanvon main kam laagat vaale 100 se bhi zyaada evapotranspereshan toilet (evapotranspiration toilets) banavaa chuki hai
 
 
 These days she is working to build 20 new toilets in another rural part of Uttar Pradesh
 
 
 dilachasp baat yah he ki marta vainduzar-snow dwaara banawaye gaye evapotranspereshan toilet kii laagat sirf 9,978 rupee aati he, jabaki svachh bharat abhiyaan ke tahat sarkaar dwaara banawaye gaye shauchalay kii laagat lagbhag 17,000 rupee he
 
 
 Construction of these toilets in these villages benefiting from Marta's work has proved to be the end of 'open defecation trend'
 
 
 usuri ke rahane vaale ek gramin ne kaha, "meri beti ke liye shauchalay banvaanaa meraa sapana tha
 
 
 i felt bad that he had to retire in the open, or hold the pressure for too long
 
 
 ab main marta ke saath kaam kar rahaa hum, or apane gaanv main or shauchalay banavaane main unki madad kar rahaa hum
 
 
 i am doing this not for the money, but for the good of my family and the village
 
 
 " See also, a video prepared by NDTV Special Projects team about Marta's work

 bharat-pakistan ke bich aasmaan main waar-palatwaar ke bich bahes ke centre main ladaaku vimaan epa-16 he
 Pakistan is stubbornly saying that he went into the Indian airspace and attacked, but he is not at all convinced that he used the fighter aircraft F-16 in this operation
 jabaki bhartiya vayusena ne guuruuvaar ko baqayada saboot dekar yah sabit kar diya ki bharat kii seemaa main pakistan ne jo vimaan bheje the, unamem epa-16 shaamil tha
 Now the question is, why is there so much debate about F-16 and why Pakistan is refusing this aircraft to come to India? Are attached
 ye wo ladaaku vimaan he jise america ne aatank ke khilaaf ladaai ladane ke liye pakistan ko diya tha
 But now Pakistan has started protecting the terrorists from it
 F-16 ke liye america ke niyamef-16 america main bana ladaaku vimaan he, or isamen lagane vaali emerom missile bhi america main hi banati he
 The US has conditions for the use of this aircraft
 pakistan ko ye vimaan is shart ke saath diya gaya tha ki wo bina america kii parmishan ke kisi takaraav main iskaa istemaal nahin kar saktaa he
 That is, Pakistan cannot use it to attack another country
 aatank ke khilaaf ection lene ke liye hi pakistan is vimaan kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 It is believed that this is the biggest reason due to which Pakistan is trying to tell the story of its audacity to the whole world, but at the same time it is denying the attack by F-16 aircraft
 pakistan sena ke pravaktaa major general asif gafoor ne 27 farvari ko apane aadhikarik bayaan main kaha tha ki jis fiter epa-16 ko giraane kaa daawa bharat kar rahaa he, vah is mishan kaa hissaa hi nahin tha
 India said the attack on military bases on 26 February, the strike by the Indian Air Force in Balakot, Pakistan, was on the bases of the Jaish terrorists
 bhartiya videsh mantralay ne apane aadhikarik bayaan main is karrwai ko khufia input ke aadhaar aatank ke khilaaf ection qaraar diya
 However, the next day Pakistan sent its fighter aircraft to Rajouri in Jammu and Kashmir and targeted Indian military bases
 bharat sarkaar ne 27 farvari ko die apane bayaan main saaf kaha he ki aantak ke khilaaf bharat kii karrwai kaa jawaab pakistan ne sainya thikaanon par atake kar diya he, jo niyamon kaa ulanghan he
 To expose this audacity of Pakistan, there is a discussion about F-16 in both countries
 pakistan lagaataar is vimaan ko ladaai main bhejne se manaa kar rahaa he, jabaki bhartiya vayusena ke air vaais marshall arjike kapur ne epa-16 main lagane vaale emerom missike kaa tukdaa dikhaakar yah sabit kar diya he ki pakistan ne aatank ke khilaaf bharat kii ladaai kaa jawaab dene ke liye us vimaan kaa istemaal kiya he, jo america ne use aatankwaad se ladane ke liye diya tha
 Now, we have to see what action America takes in this direction

 1952 main hue pehle aam chunaav main is seat se nirdaleey ummidavaar shesh giri ne jeet darj kii
 However, in the 4 general elections that followed, Congress leader Pendekanti waved a successive victory
 is bich siyasat ne karavat lee or andhra pradesh ke siyaasi maahaul main bhuuchaal laane vaala pal aa gaya
 Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, a veteran Andhra Pradesh Congress leader, rebelled from the party and joined the Janata Party
 iske baad 1977 ke aam chunaav main reddy ne 35 hajaar se zyada voton ke antar se pendekanti ko haraaya
 But the Janata Party failed to translate this victory and Pendekanti again won this seat in the by-election held immediately after Reddy resigned

 The Chief Minister appealed to the NDA allies and 20 representatives of opposition parties to help in overcoming the situation and said, “the matter is in the High Court, my hands are tied
 ''sarkari naukariyon or shaikshanik sansthaaon main 16 fisadi aarakshan kii maang par maraathon kaa gussa sadak par koharaam machaa rahaa he
 The agitators are blocking roads and setting cars on fire
 unhone 9 agast ko maharashtra ko puri tarah se band kar dene kii dhamkee di he
 In a way, due to the anger of the Marathas, the Chief Minister has been confined to his office of "ministry", the Secretariat of Mumbai
 lagata he, fadavis apni bhaajapa main bhi akele pad gaye hai, na to unka koi cabinet sahyogi or na hi koi party netaa madad karne aage aa rahaa he
 The agitating Maratha leaders have refused to talk to the Chief Minister, as they believe that the Chief Minister has misrepresented his case in the High Court
 fadavis ko 22 july ko apni pangarpur tirthayatra bhi radd kerani padi
 They have been visiting Naga Ashadhi Ekadashi every year to visit the temple
 unhone kaha ki aisi khufia khabaren thim ki us avasar par jutane vaale kareeb 10 lakh bhakton kii bheed main maratha pradarshnkaree bhagdad machaa sakate hai
 This further angered the Maratha community
 iske pehle 9 july ko fadavis ne kaha tha ki 72,000 sarkari naukariyon ke liye jo vishaal bhartee abhiyaan chalane vaala he, uskaa 16 fisadi hissaa "backlog'' ke rup main roak kar rakhaa jayega, maraathon ko aarakshan ke maamle main hycourt ke nirnay ke intjaar main
 But this too proved to be the opposite
 rajasav mantri chandrakant patil ekmaatr aise varisht bhaajapa netaa hai, jinhone saarvajanik taur par fadavis kaa bachaav kiya he
 State BJP chief Raosaheb Danve is keeping a mysterious silence
 is bich, 28 july kii sarvadaleey baithak ke baavjood congress, rakanpa or shivasena ne 30 july ko baithak karke is bare main ranneeti banaai ki fadavis sarkaar ko kaise gheraa jaae
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said, “the government should announce Maratha reservation without any delay
 '' rajya congress ke adhyaksh ashok chavaan ne maang kii ki rajyapal vidyasagar raav fouran dakhal den, kyonki halaat mukhyamantri ke kaabo se baahar ja rahe hai
 Legally, Fadnavis cannot do anything special at this time
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki sab ko saadhane main unki naakaami ne hi unako alag-thalag kar diya he
 He set up the Maharashtra Backward Classes Commission in 2015 on the direction of the Bombay High Court to determine whether the people of the Maratha community are backward or not
 unhone maraathon ko yah aashwaasan bhi diya ki jaise hi ayog kii report aati he (ise hycourt kii bhi manjuuri chahie) ve aarakshan lagu kar denge
 But this commission also proved to be lax
 iske pehle adhyaksh jaj sambhajirao mhase kaa pichley saal nidhan ho gaya

 ji
 Gaikwad's term ends in September
 parantu ekstansion milane ke baad ve teen maheene main report de sakate hai
 Fadnavis expects the report to come out by the end of August, with additional staff and resources available
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki yah sab pehle karnaa chahie tha
 There is still many work to be done
 fadavis ne vaada kiya he ki rajya ke sabhi 38 jilon main maratha chaatr-chaatraon ke liye hostel banaae jaaenge, lekin abhi sirf do jilon kolhapur or pune main hi kaam shuru ho paaya he
 He had also announced to pay half the fees of Maratha students by the government, but most colleges refused to admit students without taking full amount in advance
 to, jab tak iskaa samaadhaan nahin nikal jaataa, fadavis ke sitare gardish main rahenge

 The study team included 295 women, aged 26 to 65, who had sex twice a month in their research
 unhone yah bhi paaya ki kai baar sex karne se yon santushti nahin hoti jo achche swasthya ke liye jaruri he

 ’’mila swasthy rahane kaa rajanishkarsh main yah bhi khulaasa kiya gaya he ki jin mahilaon ne yon asantushti kii baat sweekaari unamem ve hameshaa kam sex karti thim
 Professor Suzanne Davis, accompanying in this research, said, "it emphasizes that women's habit of having sex over and over again should not be interpreted as indicating a better sex life
" ’’ ‘da jarnal aaf sexual medicin’ ne in nishkarshon ko prakashit kiya he or isaki pradhan sampadak da

 jammu-kashmir ke masale par grih mantri amit shah kaa sansad ke donon sadanon main diya bhaashan charchaa main he
 The sharp remarks and facts with which he spoke in both houses of the House on the issue of Section 370 and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill are being described as charismatic
 unhone yahaan tak kaha ki vah jammu-kashmir ke masale par uthne vaale har sawaal kaa sadan main jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 He made Congress mps uncomfortable many times by asking the stand of Congress on the issue of Section 370 and UN
 mukherjee ne nahin kiya dhara 370 kaa samarthalamit shah ne mangalvaar ko loksabhaa main dhara 370 par chhidi bahes ke dauraan kaha ki yah galat he ki shyama prasad mukherjee ke kaaran dhara 370 bani he
 When National Conference MP Hassain Masoodi spoke about the consent of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee on Article 370, Amit Shah said that by bringing references anywhere, show that Shyama Prasad Mukherjee has talked about Article 370
 unhone kaha ki aapako bolne kaa adhikaar he, magar iskaa matlab yah nahin ki asaty bolenge
 He said- i want to ask Masoodi sir where Mukherjee had welcomed Article 370
 unhone 370 hataane ke liye jaan di he
 Hasnain Masoodi then asked whether Article 370 did not happen with Mukherjee's consent
 is par amit shah ne kaha- ve kehete hai ki mukherjee ji cabinet ke sadsy the
 i want to state for the record of the House that that cabinet was not the elected cabinet of any one party
 sarvadaleey cabinet thi
 The resolutions that have been moved in the Constituent Assembly have gone through the cabinet
 assembly ne khud charchaa karke samvidhan likhane kaa kaam kiya he samvidhan banane ke baad yah tay hua ki koi bhi prastaav jo kanoon banane ke liye jayega, vah cabinet ke thru jayega
 The authority was given to that cabinet by the Constituent Assembly, which made the constitution
 isliye cabinet ke andar shyama prasad mukherjee the iskaa matlab yah nahin ki unhone dhara 370 kaa samarthan kiya
 Cannot bring gun to the temple, Amit Shah rejected this when Congress leader Shashi Tharoor questioned Farooq Abdullah's detention in Lok Sabha
 unhone kaha,"faruk abdulla ji apane ghar main he
 There is neither house arrest nor detention
 unki tabiyat bhi acchhee he
 You are in fun, just talk a little bit
 agar unako yahaan nahin aana he to canapati par gan rakhkar nahin laa sakate hai
 Amit Shah also quipped on a claim by Shashi Tharoor
 unhone kaha ki shashi tharur, jis baat ke liye kot kar rahe hai, vah sardaar patel ke liye nahin balki hamane balki shyama prasad ke liye kahi he
 Probably not in the house at that time
 kisi ne galat chit unhen pakadaa di he
 Article 370 prevents Kashmir from being annexed to India During the debate on Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill, Amit Shah said that a question arose that pok gave to Kashmir
 main spasht karnaa chahta hum ki bijepi or modi sarkaar pioke ko kabhi nahin chhod sakati
 Even today 24 seats of pok are going to be a part of us
 jo bill upasthit hua he, usamen pioke or aksai chin kaa ullekh he
 Each inch is mentioned
 daawa utana hi majboot he, jitna pehle tha
 Amit Shah said that there were several speeches earlier that Article 370 connects India with Kashmir
 vastav main dhara 370 bharat ko kashmir se nahin jodatii he, balki dhara 370 bharat ko kashmir se jodne se rokatii he
 People who have been sitting inside the heart of the tees for 70 years, when that time comes, the expression of pleasure should not be justified
 desh kaa baccha-baccha bolta he ki kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 Whether you go to Bengal, go to Tamil Nadu, go to Gujarat, go to Maharashtra or go to Uttar Pradesh, i want to ask why don't you say that Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu is an integral part of India
 kashmir ke liye isliye bolnaa padataa he, kyonki dhara 370 ne is desh or duniya ke man main shankaa aropit kii thi ki kashmir bharat kaa ang he yaa nahin
 Nehru would like to have a poke with us
 Amit Shah said in 1965 about the indo-pakistan war that when the army was winning, the army came after winning our part under the jurisdiction of the Pakistani tribes, then who unilaterally broke the armistice Had done it
 ? yah nehru ne kiya tha
 Today is pok for the same reason
 agar hamaari senaaon ko chhot di jaati to aaj pioke bharat adhikrut hota
 Amit Shah asked Congress leader Adhir Ranjan - who had taken the Kashmir issue to the UN
 dher saare dastavej hai
 The Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of the country were preached in the room of All India Radio without being taken into confidence
 nehru yuan lekar gaye the
 He is a great lawyer
 370 or 371 ke bich kaa antar bataanaa chahta hum
 370 is a temporary provision in respect of the State of Jammu and Kashmir
 hataane kii jarurat isliye he, kyonki yah desh kii sansad kaa akhriyaar kam karata he
 Many laws which have been made for the good of the people do not reach the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 jammu-kashmir ke logon ke man main algaavvaad kii bhaavana ko pakistan petrol daal kar bhadkaa rahaa he
 un's proposal was rejected, Amit Shah said during the debate in Lok Sabha that the UN resolution was rejected on the same day in 1965, when Pakistan's forces encroached our borders
 jahaan tak yuan kaa maamla he to bharat kii simaaon ke andar koi bhi nirnay lene ke liye bharat kii sansad ke donon sadanon ko puraa sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 Masoodi Sahib raised the issue of the reference
 refrendom to tabhi khatm ho gaya, jab pakistan ne varsh 1965 main bharat kii simaaon kaa atikaraman kiya
 The UN has also acknowledged this
 amit shah bole ki kaha ja rahaa he ki 72 ghante kaa karfu he
 i want to ask how many hours of curfew were there when the Congress was in the National Conference, when terrorism was going up during the Congress
 masudi sahab mujhe lagata tha ki aap apana jajment kot karenge, magar aapane nahin kiya, kyonki aapako bhi maaloom he ki yah jajment khokhla tha
 It is being said that your agenda is communal
 main is baat ko sire se khaarij karnaa chahta hum
 How can section 370 be a communal agenda
 kya jammu-kashmir main hindu, jain, buddha or sikh nahin rahete hai
 How can this be a communal agenda
 ovaisi sahab ne kaha ki sadan aitihaasik bhul karne ja rahaa he, ham aitihaasik bhul nahin karne ja rahe, balki aitihaasik bhul sudhaarney ja rahe hai
 i am confident that seeing the development that is going to take place under the leadership of the PM within the next five years, the people of the valley will also say that the clang of Article 370 was caught by us, it hurt us a lot

 kai kshetron kii diggaj hastiyon ne modi ke kaarykaal main ashishnutaa badhane kii baat kahi, jiskaa modi sarkaar kii ore se lagaataar khandan kiya jaataa rahaa
 Now before Lok Sabha elections 2019, Aaj Tak tried to find out through survey with Karvy Insights that India has really become intolerant country
 ajtak or karvi incits ke survey main yah baat saamne ai ki desh kii 41 fisadi janata maanati he ki desh main ashishnutaa badi or bharat ashishnu desh ban gaya
 41 per cent of people across the country believe that the country has become intolerant, while in Uttar Pradesh this figure is 33 per cent
 haalanki is mudde par survey main shaamil 41 fisadi log aisa nahin maanate hai
 At the same time, 38 percent people in Uttar Pradesh say that the country has not become intolerant
 is survey main aise logon kii sankhya bhi zyada he jo is maamle main spasht nahin hai
 18 per cent of people across the country and 29 per cent in Uttar Pradesh are in a position to say nothing on this question
 yah survey 2,478 logon par kiya gaya
 The survey was conducted in a total of 20 Lok Sabha constituencies in Uttar Pradesh from 28 December to 8 January
 kya aap maanate hai ki pichley 5 saal main desh zyada ashishnu ho gaya he, is maamle main purush or mahilaon kii soch main 33 fisadi kaa antar he
 This difference is 34% among men and 31% difference among females
 ajtak or karvi incits kaa survey desh kaa mizaaj yani mood of da nesan bataata he ki uttar pradesh main sapa-basapa-areldi gathbandhan pradesh kii 80 main se 58 siten jeet saktaa he or pichley loksabhaa chunaav main 73 siten jeetne vaali bijepi-apana dal gathbandhan ko 18 siton tak simit kar saktaa he
 However, if Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav join the Congress along with the RLD in their alliance then UP can prove to be Waterloo for the BJP
 survey ke nateezon ke anusaar aisa hone par bijepi kaa vot share 2014 ke 43
 From 3 per cent will be reduced to 36 per cent, but the seats it gets will be reduced to just 5 seats instead of 73
 shesh 75 siten bahujan samaaj party (basapa), samaajawaadee party (sapa), rashtriya lokdal (areldi) or congress ke khate main chali jaaengi
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 73 (71 + 2) seats from Uttar Pradesh were instrumental in bringing Narendra Modi to the power of the Center from the BJP, but the results of this survey showed that if the grand alliance was formed in the state, then the BJP Modi's victory chariot may also stop at the center as well as a severe setback

 Date - 7 February 2014, Time - 6:30 pm, Place - Neb Sarai area of delhi
 dilli ke neb sarai ilaake kii freedom fiter colony ke get number 4 ke paas property dling kaa kaam karne vaale sanjeev sejwaal apane offis main apane chachare bhai sandip, apane dost paramjeet or apane naukar ashok ke saath baithe the
 Just then, a Nissan vehicle arrives outside his office and stops
 usamen se sani, vijaypal, rakesh or aman goyal utarate hai
 Among these, Vijaypal is the bodyguard of Aman
 ye sabhi ek meeting ke liye milane vaale the
 Actually, Sandeep Sejwal called this meeting to resolve an issue between Paramjeet and Sunny
 lekin baat sulajhane ke bajaae bigadati chali jaati he
 a debate between the two sides begins
 isi dauraan paramjeet sani ko maafee maangane ko kahata he
 But Sunny refuses to apologize after listening to him
 is baat se tilamilaayaa paramjeet sani ko thappad maar detaa he
 Vijaypal also gives a slap to Paramjit after seeing his friend raise his hand
 iske baad to offis kaa maahaul bighad jaataa he
 Sunny and Vijaypal take out the revolver from their pocket
 abhi koi kuch samaj paata, tabhi sani or vijaypal paramjeet or uske doston par tabadatod goliyon chalaani shuru kar dete hai
 Seeing this, Sanjeev escapes from there and closes the shutter of his office from outside
 tabhi unhen offis ke andar se paramjeet ke chillane kii awaz aati he
 But when they enter the office again, they are also shot
 sandip ko collar bone or baaju main goliyaan lagati hai
 Paramjeet suffers bullets in his back and shoulders
 chunki goliyaan donon taraf se chali thim, isliye is cross firing main sani ke dost rakesh kii chaati main bhi goli lagati he
 Hearing the sound of gunfire, people nearby call the police
 is bich sandip ke offis ke baahar logon kii bheed ikatthi ho jaati he
 Seeing the crowd of people, Sunny, Vijaypal and Aman try to escape from there
 isi bhagdaud main aman apni gaadi vahiin chhodkar mauka-e-vaardaat se bhaagane main kaamyaab ho jaataa he
 Sunny and Vijaypal run towards IGNOU Road firing air
 us road par apni inova gaadi se ja rahe ek shaks ko revolver dikhaakar uski gaadi chin lee
 The police had also reached the opportunity without any time
 lihaaza vahaan pahunchakar police team sani, vijaypal or aman ke faraar hone kii khabar pisiar ko detii he
 Meanwhile, in order to escape from the police, Sunny turns the vehicle towards the army farm, but a police team's car from Neb Sarai police station stops them in the middle and arrests them both
 police sani or vijaypal ko giraftaar kar chuki thi
 His injured friend Rakesh was also in his custody
 lekin goliyaan lagane kii vajah se paramjeet kii mauka-e-vaardaat par hi maut ho chuki thi or sandip sejwaal kii aspataal main ilaaj ke dauraan maut ho jaati he
 But before he dies, everyone is shocked to hear the truth of this shootout to the police
 police sani or vijaypal ko bhaagane kii koshish main pakad chuki thi
 On the other hand, what Sandeep told the police before he died in the hospital, the matter was cleared like a mirror in front of him
 lekin kya aap wo sachai nahin jaananaa chahenge, jisamen do logon kii maamuli-si kahasuni main baat itani bigadi kii do logon kii jaan chali gai
 The story that came to the police after Sunny and Vijaypal was arrested, she was surprised to hear that
 police ke mutabik sani or vijaypal indira anchlev main rahete hai
 Sunny Sonipat and Vijaypal hail from Rohtak and both are bouncers from Haryana
 lekin dilli main privet bodyguard kaa kaam karte the
 During this time, Sunny met a girl and he started liking her
 itnaa hi nahin, usne use phone karne shuru kar die
 But the girl did not like Sunny
 ladki ne ye baat apane dost paramjeet ko bataai
 About this, Paramjeet forbade Sunny to call her friend again and even scolded her
 lekin sani or vijaypal ko paramjeet kaa use is tarah se daantnaa bura lag gaya
 Actually, Paramjeet felt bad about Sunny's calling her girlfriend
 lihaaza usne khud sani ko samajhane or dobaaraa aisa naa karne ke makasad se use phone kiya
 But Sunny felt bad about her scolding and wanted to teach Paramjeet a lesson
 isi makasad se usne ye baat apane kuch doston ko bataai
 Sunny told this to a friend of his son Rakesh, who lives in Sonepat, and Aman Goyal, a businessman living in Delhi's military farm
 udhar paramjeet bhi ye baat apane property dealer dost sandip sejwaal ko bataa chukaa tha
 Sandeep called a meeting between Paramjeet and Sunny to end the rivalry
 lekin meeting ke dauraan baat sulajhane ke bajaae itani bighad gai vahaan golibari shuru ho gai or is golibari main do logon kii maut ho gai
 Talking about refusing to call a girl was first heard and then scuffled and then increased so much that Sunny and her friend Vijaypal attacked Paramjeet with a terrible attack and two people lost their lives in this incident
 unke qatl ke aarope main teen aropiyon ko ab shaayad taumr jail kii salaakhon ke peeche kaatani padey
 Police have arrested three accused Sunny, Vijaypal and Rakesh Malik in this case and are searching for their fourth friend Aman
 police ke mutabik usne maamle kii exiaar darj kar lee he or wo is puure maamle main aman ke role kii jaanch kar rahi he
 The police have recovered Sunny's revolver, but have not yet found Vijayapal's weapon
 philhal police maamle kii faraar aaropee or sani ke dost aman goyal kii talash kar rahi he
 With this, she is trying to find out that no one other than the accused was involved in this incident
 lekin jab tak is maamle kaa chauthaa aaropee uski giraft main nahin aa jaataa, tab tak maamla puri tarah se nahin sulajh paaegaa

 The war of words in Ahmedabad over the spying of a woman is intensifying
 congress ke netaa manish tiwari ne aaj narendra modi ko 'sahibzada' kaha he
 Earlier Modi has been calling Rahul Gandhi as 'shahzada'
 darasal, ek mahila kii avaidh jasusi se jude maamle main gujarat ke purv grih rajyamantri amit shah kii ek kathith sidi main ek sahib ke kehane par mahila kii jasusi kii baat saamne ai he
 Manish Tiwari has said this in a gesture to Narendra Modi without naming him
 is maamle main congress ne supreme court ke jaj se jaanch karaane kii maang kii to duusari taraf narendra modi kah rahe hai ki congress ko meri lokapriyata hajam nahin ho rahi
 But the interesting thing is that there is no complaint about the woman or her family, on the contrary, the father himself has admitted to requesting about the monitoring of the daughter
 udhar, bijepi ne safai di he ki mahila ko khatra tha isliye uske pita kii maang par uski nigaraanee kii gai
 BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi said if the woman or her husband or her father said anything, then why is the Congress jumping on this issue
 is bich mahila ke pita ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki unke kehane par hi unki beti ko nigaraanee main rakhaa gaya, lekin congress ne is maamle ko mahila kii nijee aazaadee ke haq se jod diya he or kaha he ki modi sarkaar ne apni takat kaa galat istemaal kiya
 On November 15, two investigative websites Cobrapost and Gulail claimed that Amit Shah, former Gujarat home minister and close aide of Modi, had ordered illegal surveillance of a woman at the behest of 'sahab'

 modi sarkaar ipies adhikariyon ke pramotion ko unke shaareerik fitness se jodne kii yojana bana rahi he
 The system is already in place among central para-military forces
 jahaan varisht adhikariyon ko 'shape1' ke rup main pramanit hote he, jo fitness ke hoiest level ko indicate karata he
 Such as psychological health, listening, physical ability, and eyesight, etc
, which shows that they are eligible for promotion
 grih mantralay ke sutron ne bataaya ki ipies adhikariyon ke pramotion ke liye fitness anivaary banane kaa prastaav pehle se hi karmiyon or prashikshan vibhaag dwaara or sabhi rajyon or sangh shasit pradesh ko unke jabaav ke liye diya gaya he
 The states were reportedly asked to return their views and suggestions by July 3, but have not yet responded
 diopiti sanchaar ke anusaar 21 june ko rajyon / sangh shasit pradeshon ke liye, "grih mantralay (emechae) ne ipies adhikariyon kii shaareerik fitness ko ipies adhikariyon ke liye ek anivaary upaay ke rup main laane kii kii sifarish kii thi
 This would make them understandable before promoting in various categories in IPS
 ipies adhikariyon ko vibhinn grad main padonnati karne ke liye ipies (vetan) niyamon ke niyam 3 main sanshodhan karne kaa prastaav rakhaa gaya he
 So that promotion is subject to physical fitness as may be issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs from time to time
 grih mantralay ke ek adhikari ke mutabik, sabhi ipies adhikariyon ko varishthata ke agle str tak pramotion se pehle ek sweekrut sarkari aspataal main yaa ek pramanit medical board se pehle anivaary shaareerik fitness test lene ke liye kaha jayega
 The reason behind making fitness mandatory for promotion for IPS officers is that they, especially at DIG, IG, ADG and DG levels, need to move forward
 saath hi apane aadesh ke tahat un logon ke lieek udhaaharan nirdhaarit karen jo shaareerik swasthya ko gambhirtha se le
 According to a Home Ministry official, "unlike an IAS officer, an IPS officer must be physically fit and active to handle field work in times of unrest and other law and order emergencies
 diopiti dwaara ipies (vetan) niyamon dwaara prastaavit do anya sanshodhano main, sarkaar ne ipies adhikariyon dwaara do saal kii probeshan ko puraa karne main deree ko bedakhal karne kii maang kii he taaki probeshan kii samaapti kii taarikh se do varsh tak "senior time scale" niyukti ke liye yogyata kii gananaa kii ja sake
 It was further proposed that an IPS officer must complete a minimum of one-week three domain specialization training program before promotion to the rank of DIG, IG and ADG

 At the time of the fourth election of the President in the country in 1967, the maximum number of 17 candidates were in the fray, while 15 candidates were in the fray during the President's fifth election
 desh ke 13wein raashtrapati kaa chunaav bhi isse itar nahin he
 It is expected that this time the UPA candidate Pranab Mukherjee will be pitted against only bjp-backed PA Sangma along with BJD and AIADMK
 raashtrapati chunaav kii prakriya main samay ke saath badlaav hone ke kaaran ab raashtrapati bhawan jane kaa sapana paalane vaale ummidavaaron kii sankhya nishchit hi kam ho gai he
 The secret voting system was first introduced in 1969 with the intention of making the presidential election more serious and important
 yahi nahin, matdaan patron ke kramank daalane kaa silsilaa bhi isi chunaav se shuru hua tha
 The election of the President of 1969 holds a very important place in the politics of the country
 is chunaav main congress ke adhikrut ummidavaar neelam sanjeev reddy ko indira gandhi ke pratyaashee ve ve giri ne buree tarah parajeet kar diya tha
 It is a matter of fact that Neelam Sanjit Reddy was elected unopposed in the 1977 presidential election
 neelam sanjeev reddy kaa nirvirodh chunaa janaa desh kii raajnneeti kii ek aisi avismaraneey ghatana thi jisaki aaj ke raajnneetik paridrishy main kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati he
 Citizens have taken keen interest in the process of election to the post of the first citizen of the country
 yahi vajah he ki raashtrapati pad ke liye 1952 main sampann pratham chunaav main da rajendra prasad ke alaava chaar anya pratyaashiyon ne bhi hissaa liya
 In the second election held in 1957 for the post of President, Dr
 Rajendra Prasad also faced two other candidates
 dwitiya raashtrapati da sarvapalli radhakrishnan ke chunaav ke samay 1962 main bhi do anya ummidavaar chunaav maidan main the
 At the time of the election of the third President of the country, Dr
 Zakir Hussain, 16 other candidates were in the fray in 1967 while at the time of the election of VV Giri in 1969, there were 15 candidates for the presidential candidate
 is chunaav main haalanki neelam sanjeev reddy congress ke adhikrut ummidavaar the lekin shrimati indira gandhi ne ve ve giri ko chunaav maidan main utaara tha
 During the election, an anonymous form was circulated in the Central Hall of Parliament House with derogatory remarks about a candidate
 baad main isi parche ko aadhaar banaakar ve ve giri ke chunaav ko ucchtam nyaayalay main chunauti di gai thi
 It is a matter of fact that this election petition was rejected by the Supreme Court on 14 September 1970
 raashtrapati chunaav main ummidavaaron kii badhati sankhya or chunaav kii vaidhaniktaa ko adaalat main chunauti diye jane jaise tathyon ke maddenjar sarkaar ne nirvachan ayog kii sifarish par march 1974 main raashtrapati or up raashtrapati kanoon, 1952 main sansad se sanshodhan karaayaa
 After these amendments, the signature of at least ten candidates as proposers and the same number of electors as approvers were also made mandatory for each candidate in the presidential election
 iske alaava pehali baar chunaav main jamaanat raashi ke rup main 2500 rupe jamaa karaane kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya
 Not only this, it was arranged that the election petition could be filed in the Supreme Court only with the joint signature of the defeated candidate or at least 20 electors
 is praavdhaan ke baad chunaav maidan main utarane vaale pratyaashiyon kii sankhya main kami aayi
 In the presidential election held in August 1974, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed was pitted against the only candidate Tridiv Chaudhary while in 1977 Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy was elected unopposed for the presidency
 neelam sanjeev reddy ke baad 1982 main congress ke gyani gel singh kaa muqabla sevanivrutt nyaayadhish ech aar khanna se hua tha
 The presidential election in 1987 took an interesting turn when the nomination papers of r Venkataraman of Congress and Justice v Krishna Iyer of the Opposition besides an independent Mithilesh Kumar were also found correct
 nirdaleey mithilesh kumaar kii sthiti itani vicitra thi ki chunaav ke dauraan ek baar vah moti baag main ek ped ke neeche so gaye to unke chaaron ore surakshakarmiyon ko suraksha gheraa daalana padaa
 Mithilesh Kumar was allotted a huge bungalow in the New Delhi area for security reasons
 is bangale main mithilesh kumaar ke sone ke liye ek badi or moti dari muhaiyaa karaayi gayi thi
 Although in this election Venkataraman was won by huge votes but Mithilesh Kumar was also successful in getting 2223 votes
 venkataraman ke sevanivrutt hone par hue chunaav main congress ke dow shankar dayaal sharma ke saamne vipaksh ke jiji swell, prakhyat vakil ram jethmalani or dharti pakad kaaka joginder singh chunaav maidan main the
 In this election, Jethmalani got 2704 votes and 1135 votes for the earth
 is sthiti ke baad yah maang jor pakadaney lagi ki raashtrapati or uparashtrapati ke chunaav ko adhik gambhir banaaya jaae or isamen namakan patron par prastaavon or anumodakon kii sankhya badhaane ke saath hi jamaanat raashi main bhi vruddhi kii jaae
 The comments iske baad ek baar phir agast 1997 main sarkaar ne adhyadesh ke jariye raashtrapati or uparashtupati kanoon main sanshodhan kiya
 After this amendment, the bail amount was increased to Rs 15,000, with each nomination in the presidential election making the proposal and the signature of at least 50-50 electors as approvers mandatory

 In the presidential election held in July 1997, Congress nominee KR Narayanan faced former Chief Election Commissioner TN Seshan, while the Left Front fielded Captain Laxmi Sehgal during the 2002 election of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam
 desh kii pratham mahila raashtrapati ke rup main raashtrapati bhawan pahunchane vaali shrimati pratibha devisingh patil ko bhi 2007 main chunaav kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In this election he was pitted against senior BJP leader Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 desh main raashtrapati ke chauthe chunaav ke samay 1967 main sabase adhik 17 ummidavaar maidan main the jabaki raashtrapati ke paanchave chunaav ke vakt 15 pratyaashee maidan main the
 The election of the 13th President of the country is also no other than this
 ummid he ki is baar samprag ke pratyaashee pranab mukherjee kaa muqabla bijd or annadramuk ke saath hi bhaajapa samarthit sirf pie sangama se hi hoga
 Due to change in the process of presidential elections over time, now the number of candidates who dream of going to Rashtrapati Bhavan has definitely reduced

 magar ab aalia bhatta is sadame se ubhar chuki hai
 Alia Bhatt took leave to go out of 'fantastic' failure and went to a secluded place so that she could forget Fantastic
 aalia ne ek akhbaar ko die intervyuu main kaha he ki shandaar kii asafalataa kii mujhe ummid nahin thi
 There was a lot of trust in that film, so it hurt
 us dukh se baahar nikalne ke liye maine pehali baar chuttee lee thi
 Went outside Mumbai for 3 days and lived in solitude
 tippaniyan Alia thanked her family for coming out of the grief and said that my family was with me and encouraged me
 jab main chuttee par baahar chali gai thi tab bhi mere pita mahesh bhatta har rose esemes karte the, jo protsaahan se bhare hote the
 Forgetting the old misery, Alia is focusing on a new project, including the film with Shah Rukh Khan
 aalia apane pita mahesh bhatta kii bhi film main kaam karengi, jisaki script par kaam chal rahaa he magar kahani ab tak tay nahin hui he
 But now Alia Bhatt has emerged from this shock
 'shandaar' kii naakaami se baahar nikalne ke liye aalia bhatta ne chuttee lee or ekant jagah par gai taaki wo bhul saken shandaar ko
 Alia has said in an interview to a newspaper that i did not expect spectacular failure
 bahut bharosa tha us film par isliye dukh hua
 The first time i took leave was to get out of that misery
 3 din tak mumbai ke baahar gai or ekant main rahi
 The comments alia ne dukh se baahar nikalne main apane parivaar ke saath kaa shukriya adaa kiya or kaha ki meraa parivaar mere saath tha or mujhe hausala de rahaa tha
 Even when i went out on vacation, my father Mahesh Bhatt used to SMS everyday, which was full of encouragement
 philhal puraane dukh bhuulakar aalia nae project par dhyaan de rahi hai, jisamen shahrukh khan ke saath bhi film shaamil he
 Alia will also work in the film of her father Mahesh Bhatt, whose script is in the works, but the story has not been decided yet

 aise main sawaal ye he ki jeenyu ne niyamon kaa paalan karnaa kab se shuru kiya he?jnu asked Romila Thapar for her CV for her professor emeriti status
 JNU rule: After Professors reach the age of 75, JNU reviews their status & asks for cvsromila Thapar is 87 years old

 Therefore, it is necessary to keep watering the plants from time to time

 The comments pakistan ke liye ye behad acchhee khabar he, kyonki unhen srilanka team ke saath apana abhyaas match pehle is maidan par khelnaa he
 Then, in the Super 10 match on the 16th, you have to meet the Group a qualifier team in Round 1
 matlab 19 march ko hone vaale bharat ke saath mukaable se pehle pakistan halaat se puri tarah vaakif hoga
 At the same time, the Indian team will return to Kolkata after playing a match against the Windies in Kolkata, then a practice match against South Africa in Wankhede and then against New Zealand in Nagpur on 15 March
 flat pich par pakistani ballebaaj kamaal kar sakate hai, aise main ek baar hameshaa kii tarah in donon tiimon ke bich romaanchak mukaable kii ummid kar sakate hai
 This is very good news for Pakistan, as they have to play their practice match with Sri Lanka team on this ground first
 phir 16 taarikh ko super 10 mukaable main round 1 main group e kii qualifaayar team se bhidana he
 Meaning Pakistan will be fully aware of the situation before the match with India on 19 March
 vahiin bhartiya team windies ke khilaaf kolkata, phir vankhede main dakshin africa ke khilaaf abhyaas match or phir 15 march ko newzealand ke khilaaf nagpur main match khilne ke baad vaapis kolkata aegi

 maharashtra main bhartiya janata party or shivasena kaa gathbandhan hameshaa charchaa kaa vishay rahata he
 Despite the two parties being in a coalition, such statements and pictures continue to be seen that lead to the debate of All Is Not Well
 ab jabaki matdaan kaa vakt najadik he or donon partiyaan milakar vidhansabha chunaav lard rahi hai to aise main bijepi or shivasena ke postaron ne sabakaa dhyaan khinchaa he
 In the posters put up by the BJP and Shiv Sena for campaigning, a glimpse of 'ekla Chalo Re' is seen in place of the alliance
 mumbai hi nahin puure maharashtra main donon partiyon ke hordings alag-alag najar aa rahe hai
 Bala Saheb, Uddhav Thackeray and Aditya Thackeray are seen in Shiv Sena posters, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president Amit Shah, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis are prominently featured in BJP posters
 yani donon partiyon ke netaa postaron main ekasaath nahin hai
 Praise of the functioning of the government is also being promoted in the posters of the BJP alone, five years of the bjp-shiv Sena coalition government
 dilachasp baat ye he ki devendra fadanvis ke netritv main bijepi or shivasena kii sarkaar paanch saal chali he, lekin sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko bhi bijepi-shivasena kaa sanyukt rup se nahin darshaya gaya he
 The declaration of the alliance did not come along with the announcement of the alliance, it was also said that the manifesto of BJP and Shiv Sena will be released simultaneously, but this did not happen
 shivasena ne apana alag ghoshnaa-patr jari kar diya or apane agenda ke tahat lok-lubhaavan vaade bhi kar daale
 Shiv Sena has made promises like giving nutritious food to the poor for Rs 10 and conducting 200 health tests for just one rupee
 donon dal apane-apane rastebijapi or shivasena ke ye poster jaahir kar rahe hai ki donon dal ek saath hone ke baavjood apane-apane dam par chunaav maidan main haath aajmaana chaahate hai
 While BJP has projected Devendra Fadnavis as the chief ministerial candidate, Shiv Sena is also eyeing the top post of the government
 shivasena ke postaron main thakare parivaar se pehali baar chunaav lard rahe aditya thakare ko bhi isi andaaj main pesh kiya ja rahaa he
 The Shiv Sena has put forward Aditya Thackeray in posters with his promises
 yani bijepi-shivasena ke gathbandhan main hone ke baavjood prachaar main 2014 vaali tasviir najar aa rahi he, jab donon partiyon ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha
 After the results, both the parties had formed a government together, but this time the consensus has been reached about seats in both the parties, but the way of contesting elections is seen to be the same
 aise main ye dekhnaa bhi dilachasp hoga ki bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan sarkaar banane kii sthiti main kya nae sameekaran ubharkar aate hai

 Bird watching
 
 
 in lafzon kaa istemaal college ke jamaane main ham khub karte the
 Then this was the way to express levity
 phir college se nikalakar akhbaar main aayaa hi tha ki ek din kaha gaya bird watching camp kii reporting par jaao
 Had to go to Sirpur pond in Indore, along with photographer Abrar Khan
 abraar bhai bhopal se indore transafar hokar aae the or sirpur talab pahunchane ke baad
 It was found out that he knew the name of each bird, where he laid eggs, what are the characteristics of different birds
 in sabake bare main unhen acchhee malumat thi
 Returning after that day, the real meaning of bird watching was understood, which was very different and much more relaxed than in college
 abraar bhai college kii canteen main bhi baithe hote to unki nazar samose se zyada parindon par rahati
 Sometimes i think that the way Abrar brothers see and how much they look at the birds, their wife will also be happy
 abraar bhai ne jo lat lagaai vah aaj bhi barqaraar he
 Recently one night when the fog was dissolving in the winds
 tab bharatpur bird sancturi jane ke liye chaar doston ke saath nikal padaa
 Due to the fog, Keoladeo of Bharatpur finally reached the dense Bird Sanctuary
 teen camere or parindon ko nihaarne ko betaab ankhe liye hamane cycle or rickshaw chhod paidal jane kaa faisalaa kiya
 a gray heron (heron-like bird) was seen inside the sanctuary, standing in the water waiting for the fish as if there was a wooden stump
 uske aasapaas pani tha, lekin uske andar dhairya kaa samandar
 a city like Delhi breaks the patience of so many people every day when it gets jammed
 kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki zamana jitna aadhunik hota ja rahaa he, dhiraj utana hi kam ho rahaa he
 Fans of fast food are growing, but they are forgetting the delicious taste of cooked food in slow heat

 While scratching the Russian with the head, i thought that if the apartheid also thought about which side to keep it, they would keep thinking like this for a long time
 phir ek wood pekar jise hindi belt main kathphodva kehete hai, nazar aayaa, use apane aasapaas logon kii aadat thi
 He was not scared and i too took a picture of him wholeheartedly
 baad main ek guide ne bataaya ki ye woodpekar nahin balki hoopo he, jise hudahud kehete hai
 a recent storm is named after him, but Hudhud does not cause any tornado due to his innocent existence
 park ke aakhri chor par dur kahin kuch rang birange parindon ke saath surkaab nazar aae, jinhen brahmani shell dak kehete hai
 Its wings are gold-colored, like the elites of the big cities, sitting on one side of the park away from common parlance, as if in a form house with a few select birds
 bird sancturi se nikalate hue hamen ek suar dikhaa, jo ped se khud ko ragadate hue nikal gaya
 Thick skinned
 
 
 hamaare aasapaas ke un logon jaisaa jin par bos yaa aalochakon kii baat kaa asar nahin padataa, apane main mast
 
 
 The rest battered
 bharatpur main dher saare parindon ko dekha, deshi videshi sab ek jagah par
 
 
 Animals such as jackal, nilgai, sambar, deer and pig also appeared
 dil baag-baag ho gaya
 The real bird watching is different from the college bird watching
 unhen niharta rahaa vah ud sakati thim, lekin palatakar chamakaa dengi iskaa khatara nahin tha

 BJP leader Shyamdev Rai Choudhary, who has been a seven-time MLA from South Varanasi seat, claims that bjp's condition is not good for 8 seats in Varanasi and in every seat it is getting tough competition from Samajwadi Party- Congress alliance and BSP
 shyamdev raay choudhary jinako log pyaar se 'dada' ke naam se bulaate hai, is baar dakshin varanasi seat se bijepi ne is baar unhen tikat nahin diya or unki jagah par apana chunavi debyue kar rahe nilkanth tiwari ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 Annoyed at not getting the ticket, Shyamdev Rai Chaudhary has said that he will campaign only for BJP from South Varanasi seat and not for Nilkanth Tiwari
 choudhary kaa maanate hai ki vah is baar chunaav ladanaa chaahate the or agar unhen party tikat detii to yah unka antim chunaav hota
 Chaudhary has been disappointed with his ticket being cut
 bijepi ko bhi is baat kaa ehsaas he isiilie rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne bhi pehle choudhary ko lakhanu bulaakar unhen party main koi ucch pad dene kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 According to Chaudhary, Amit Shah also admitted that the party had made a big mistake by cutting their ticket

 Chaudhary admitted that his displeasure has lessened somewhat after Prime Minister Modi's move

 In an article written in 2009, i had hoped that on the day of Namvarji's century i would join the crowd of cheering up
 ve aath saal pehle hi chal die, lekin lanbaa hi nahin, bada or bharpoor jivan jeene ke baad
 Namvarji's literary life began in the fifth decade of the twentieth century, full of achievements and controversies
 unke lekhan kaa dayera prithviraj raso se lekar ain samakaleen kavita tak tha, unka gyaan lagaataar taaja hota rahata tha, or vistrut bhi
 Also, amazing memory and speech-art
 academik gambhirtha, manamohak style or maarak vyangy ko is tarah saadhane vaale vaktaa durlabh hi hote hai
 He continued to do suggestive establishments, even less than disputed statements
 ve hindi ke shikhar aalochak hi nahin, hindi kshetra ke atyant lokmaanya lok-buddhijivi (public intelexual) bhi the
 For me Namwar Singh was the first teacher of all these narratives, was a guru
 ghar ke bujurgon main se the
 He got angry with me many times, i was also irritated by his many things and activities
 meraa unka sambandh sadaa ek hi sur-taan main nahin rahaa
 But one thing has always been true: They not only taught, they also taught
 namvarji se kai chijen sikhin, jo kerani chahie, kai jo nahin kerani chahie
 For me, he was a teacher
 ve aalochak the, sahitya ke aalochak
 Criticism is not limited to literature only
 sara darshanik soch-vichaar, halaat ko badalane kii chatapataahat aalochana se hi utpann hoti he
 Namvarji also played the role of folk-intellectual with a sense of the importance of criticism, and also of the editor
 kabhi-kabhi unke vyavhaar main apni swayan kii is bhoomika kaa khandan bhi dikhataa tha
 But overall he was clear in his mind that the sweetness of the type 'all at its own place' is in fact not only intellectual laziness, but also indicates disability
 moolbhoot maanviya pratimaanon par, vivek kii kasuti par vibhinn saamaajik-rajnatik vichaaron or vyavhaaron ko parakhane or apni jagah tay karne kaa koi vikalp he nahin
 The new paradigm of poetry published in 1968 is in this sense the original statement of Namvarji's critical vows and method
 puri kitaab yahi rekhaankit karti he ki saahitiyik aalochana kaa kaam saamne maujuud rachana kii arthmimasaa karke mulya-nirnay dena hi he, rachana kii swaittata ke saath hi uski aitihaasik sthiti kaa sammaan karte hue diya gaya mulya-nirnay
 Recall with this book, this statement of Namvarji given during the pomp of postmodernism — the article Turtle Religion published in the 1992 Samas (editor: Ashok Vajpayee)
 ''ab sahitya kaa shaastra swayan sahitya se mukt ho kar apni swaittata ghoshit karne laga he
 The work of literature is no longer telling what is literature, and what is not literature
 jab 'sahitya' jaisi kisi cheez kaa astitv hi nahin, to phir isaki talash main vakt barbaad koun kare? jab yahaan-vahaan sab kahin 'text' 'lekhan' he to ek hi kaam batch rahata he, mimasaa yaa vyakchaya kaa
 'reading' in the dialect of these new mentors
 'saahitiyik aalochana' to kya, 'aalochana' shabd maatr kaa jaise chalan uth chalaa he
 "it is important to understand that the rise of the word criticism is not only literary but also a social accident
 yah baat samajhane ke liye zyada kasarat karnaa bhi jaruri nahin, aas-paas nigaah daal lenaa kaaphi he
 One should be concerned about the society where being an intellectual is considered as sin and questioning the government is like treason
 hindi kii saahitiyik aalochana shuru se hi maanviya mulyon or un par aadhaarit arthmimasaa ke liye sangharsh karti rahi he
 Namvarji was a link to this struggle

 Deep knowledge of the subject, constant curiosity with it, amazing wits in class-room lectures, openness to questions - these things Namvarji used to teach through his teaching
 vyakti ke str par unke bare main bahut-se logon ke alag-alag tarah ke anubhav hai
 Many people say that Namvarji's hand would go into the pocket of a kurta for tea and water etc
 at some place, but came out only when someone else had paid

 "probably, they used to treat us differently, different with younger ones in age

 Not to me and Suman, yes, our children were fortunate to be called Ritwik and Ritambhara, without putting a 'ji'
 namvarji ke yogadan kaa, sahitya or uske baahar unke bhale-bure kaamon kaa moolyankan hoga hi, unke jivan-kaal main bhi hota hi rahaa
 The truth is that the dispute was his constant companion
