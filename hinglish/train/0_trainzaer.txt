 pradhanmantri manmohan singh aaj jab laal kile kii pracheer par bhaashan dene pahunche to unase ek vishesh ummid thi
 Chief Minister of Gujarat and bjp's undeclared PM candidate Narendra Modi, knowing his weakness, challenged him in the matter of speech
 ummid thi ki is baar pradhanmantri kuch nai baton or tevar ke saath bhaashan denge
 But he disappointed all the country by defeating all expectations
 apane puure bhaashan main pradhanmantri upie or desh kii uplabdhiyaan hi ginate rahe
 His speech was riddled with facts and there was little thought in it
 sust aarthik pragati, badhati keemton, bhrashtachar, sarhad par tanaav or netritv ke mudde par koi aashaa kii kiran unke bhaashan main nahin dikhi
 He definitely said that the country still has a lot to decide, but he did not elaborate on what it is and how it will happen
 unhone nahin bataaya ki viksit or taqatwar desh banane kii disha main hamaari bhavishya kii niti kya hogi
 The Prime Minister's speech dominated the cumbersome official language
 hameshaa kii tarah unhone likhaa hua bhaashan padhaa or hindi ke saamaanya shabdon par unki jubaan ladkadaati rahi
 Starting from independence, he continued to count the achievements of the country
 desh main kitni sadaken or fliover bane, vah yah bataane main vyast rahe or jin muddon par log unhen sunanaa chaahate the, un par kuch nahin kaha
 They also recounted sentences on Pakistan's attack
 rupee kii keemat main giravat par bhi unhone koi vyaavhaarik baat nahin kii
 Without making a concluding statement at the end of the speech, he made a claim that the time is not far when India will be completely liberated from poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy and the country will be happy
 piem ke bhaashan par kya kehete hai expartanlini singh, varisht patrkaar:pradhanmantri ke is kaarykaal kaa yah laal kile se aakhri bhaashan he
 The Prime Minister had a good chance
 vah yahaan se ek raajnneetik sandesh bhi de sakate the, par naakaam rahe
 Om Thanvi, Senior Journalist: i did not hear a worse speech than this
 pradhanmantri ne sirf likhi hui baaten pard di hai
 His pronunciation and flow also showed that his contribution to speech was very less
 sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginane ke manch or maukey or bhi hai or ye kaam duusare log kar sakate hai
 What does it mean to repeat these things from the Red Fort on 15 August

 It is believed that during this time, Priyanka will tell all the workers to join the grassroots level

 The ongoing climate change conference in Morocco ended late on Friday with the promise that the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement would be made by 2018 and transparency would be exercised
 bharat ne viksit deshon se doha samjhaute ko lagu kar turant apane carbon utsarjan kam karne ko bhi kaha he
 The Paris Deal came into force on 4 November this year, under which all countries have to take steps to prevent the Earth from heating up
 chintaa kii baat yah he ki saat saal pehle kopgahen main sabhi deshon ne dharti kaa taapmaana 1
 There was talk of taking steps to not increase more than 5 degrees, but so far no major efforts have been made to curb carbon emissions
 dharti kaa taapmaana tezi se bad rahaa he or vishwa mausam sanghathan yani WMO ne isi sammelan ke dauraan jo report jari kii uske mutabik vah kareeb sava degree bad chukaa he
 Disasters like floods, cyclonic storms and droughts are increasing due to the warming earth
 bharat ne is sammelan main amir deshon se apil kii he ve apane carbon utsarjan kam karen or is baat par chintaa jataai ki vikasshil deshon kii madad ke liye banaaye ja rahe green climet fund main viksit deshon ne koi rakam jamaa nahin kii he
 The comments vaise morocco main hue jalwaayu parivartan sammelan ke dauraan hi vishwa mausam sanghathan kii report ne chintaaen or badha di jisaki tazaa report ke mutabik is baat kii 90 pratishat sambhaavna he ki ye saal pichley saal kaa record bhi tod degaa or ab tak kaa sabase garam saal hoga
 On the other hand, money is the biggest problem in the campaign to stop the earth from heating up, this thing was also clearly seen in the Morocco conference
 garib or vikasshil desh mahangi saura or pawan urja ke liye amir or viksit deshon kii ore dekh rahe hai or abhi ise lekar koi spashtataa nahin he ki kitni madad mil paaegi
 On this matter, India's Forest, Environment and Climate Change Minister Anil Dave also said in his conference speech that 'there is a concern in the developing countries about the climate finance to be given before and after 2020 under the United Nations Convention
 is
 ' bataa den ki paris samjhaute ke tahat ek green climet fund bananaa he, jisaki madad se har saal garib or vikasshil deshon ko 100 billian dollar die jane hai, lekin sachai yah he ki is fund main abhi nammaatr kaa paisa jamaa hua he
 However, during the climate change conference in Morocco, the report of the World Meteorological Organization raised concerns and according to the latest report, there is a 90 percent chance that this year will break the record of last year and will be the warmest year ever
 
 udhar dharti ko garm hone se rokane kii muhim main paisa hi sabase badi dikkat he ye baat morocco sammelan main bhi saaf dekhne ko mili
 Poor and developing countries are looking to the rich and developed countries for expensive solar and wind energy and there is no clarity as to how much help will be available
 is maamle par bharat ke van, paryaavaran or jalwaayu parivartan mantri anil dave ne bhi sammelan main die apane bhaashan main kaha tha ki 'sanyukt raashtra kanvension ke tahat 2020 se pehle or uske baad die jane vaale climet finance ko lekar vikasshil deshon main chintaa bani hui he
 'let us say that a Green Climate Fund is to be formed under the Paris Agreement, with the help of which 100 billion dollars are to be given to the poor and developing countries every year, but the truth is that the fund has just a nominal amount of money

 Apart from this, the homeless people living on the pavement should be shifted to night shelters and their safety should be done
 kya koi soch saktaa he ki gubbaaraa bhi kisi bachche kii maut kaa kaaran ban saktaa he, gubaare se khelte vakt kisi bachche kii maut ho sakati he
 In Faridabad, a five-year-old child was inflating the balloon, the balloon suddenly burst and a piece of torn balloon got trapped inside the child's windpipe
 achaanak hue is haadase ke kaaran bachche kii saans atakane lagi, aanan-fanan main use paas ke aspataal pahunchaaya gaya, lekin tab tak gubaare ke us tukade kii vajah se bachche kii saansen tham chuki thi

 noida-greater noida main 30 hajaar ghar kharidaaron ko pajeshan dilaane ke liye rera ne guuruuvaar ko in ilaakon ke 7 developers ke saath meeting kii
 Officials of Noida and Greater Noida Development Authority also attended this meeting
 rera ne is baithak main 14 projects kii samiksha kii
 About 30,000 flats are stuck in these projects
 samiksha ke dauraan rera ne in projects ke pramotars or noida-greater noida vikaas praadhikaran ke adhikariyon ko bhi bulaayaa tha, jisase projects ke construction kii maujuuda sthiti ke saath vittiya sthiti or praadhikaran ke bakaayaa ke bare main bhi vistaar se jaankaree jutai ja sake
 RERA reviewed the progress of work in these projects, information about the ongoing cases in RERA and the time line for completion of the project
 in projects main shumaar hai
 
 
 Home buyers are upset due to not getting possession for a long time in all these projects and many customers have filed complaints in RERA
 ek saath itane gharon ke liye bhatakate logon ko raahat dilaane ke liye rera ne sidhe sambandhit pakshon ko bulaakar samiksha kii or logon kaa ghar kaa pajeshan dilaane kii taraf kadam badaye hai
 Member of UP RERA Balvindra Kumar said that in this review our real objective was to find a way to get possession
 hamane samiksha ke baad sabhi developers ko hidaayat di he ki wo jald se jald projects puraa karaane ke bare main sochen, jisase 30 hajaar graahakon ko unka ghar mil jaae
 It is expected that now this review will not be limited to this even and its scope will be extended further
 saath hi baaki projects ko bhi isamen shumaar kiya jayega
 According to RERA expert Venkatrao, with multiple complaints of the same kind coming to RERA, it is better to make a plan about the completion of the project by hearing the same decision again and again
 guuruuvaar kii baithak usee ranneeti kaa hissaa thi lekin isko kamyaabi tabhi milegi jab is par lagaataar najar rakhi jaae or in sabhi projects kii jarurat padane par samiksha kii jaati rahe
 Indeed, despite Rera's decision coming fast, implementing them has not proved easy
 rera ke paas bhi simit kanoonee adhikaar hai or inako majboot banane ke liye jaruratpajeshnaka rasta khojane kii he jisase logon ko pajeshan mili
 The BJP, which is dreaming of returning to power in UP, may have to face a big problem before the election
 sutron ke mutabiq anupriya patel is samay bijepi se thodi naaraaz chal rahi he
 Anupriya is upset that BJP has announced the names of candidates in its third list on the seat where the discussion was going on with Apna Dal
 aapako bataa den ki bijepi upi main apana dal or esbspi ke saath milakar chunaav lard rahi he
 The reason for this anger is that Anupriya Patel won from Rohania seat in Varanasi in 2012
 duusari seat mirzapur kii chunaar seat he jahaan se bijepi ne upi bijepi ke purv pradesh adhyaksh om prakaash singh ke bete anuraag singh ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 Apart from this, there is Manikpur seat of Banda from where BJP has nominated RK Patel
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki anupriya patel ne bijepi ke kendriya netritv se milakar apni naaraazgi jataayegi
 There was already a fierce battle in the BJP about the alliance
 aise main in siton par bijepi ke ummidavaar utaar dene se maahaul or garm ho gaya he
 Star campaigners were also not included, there was no face of Apna Dal in the list of star campaigners of BJP
 apana dal main teen bade naam hai or teenon ke teenon modi sarkaar main rajya mantri jaisi jimmedaari sambhaal rahe hai
 MP from Mirzapur Anupriya Patel, Chandauli MP Dr
 manoj kumaar pandeya or gajipur se saansad manoj sinha kaa naam bijepi kii star prachaarak list main shaamil nahin tha
 BJP is not ready, in fact, Apna Dal and SBSP of BJP had claimed more than 50 seats
 lekin, bijepi in donon hi dalon ko ek darjan se zyada seat dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 The reason is that the coalition parties in Bihar had raised the seats very much but their performance was very disappointing, so the BJPP does not want to take much risk
 apana dal ko bijepi ne di thi 38 sitapako yah bhi bataa den ki 2007 main sonelal patel ke rahete bijepi ne apana dal ko 38 siten di thim
 However these days the condition of Apna Dal is also not good

 congress haath na dikhaae yahaan siem kaa naam dikhaae
 Modi also surrounded the government on the issue of infiltration of the Chinese army, and said that China had entered the country and the government did not even know
 modi ke nishane par khaas taur se rahul gandhi rahe
 Modi said that the Congress governments have lagged behind the BJP government in terms of development
 unhone kaha ki congress kii kathani or kerani main bahut antar he
 All the things that were there in Jaipur session were forgotten in Karnataka

 Vijendra Gupta has made the allegations late Monday night over the incident of fire in tents during a wedding at Netaji Subhash Place here
 vijendra gupta ne kaha he ki niyamon kii paalna sunishchit karne ke liye jimmedaar adhikari, jinaki laaparvaahee ke kaaran is tarah kii jaanaleva durghatnaayen ghatati hai

 Vijender Gupta has alleged that temporary structures such as shamings to be used for public and private use in Delhi should have the height of the pandals not less than 3 meters as per the instructions made by the Fire Department of Delhi Government, use of synthetic materials
 Should be at least 15 meters away from the electric sub-station, furnaces and other dangerous places, the exit around the pandal Doors should have emergency power supply system, proper spacing etc

 somvaar der raat netaji subhash place main do tenton main lagi aag kii gambhir ghatana par rosh vyakt karte hue unhone kaha he ki aag lagane kii yah ghatana chaunkaa dene vaali hai
 It is a matter of relief that this incident happened after 12 pm when most of the guests had left
 agar yahi ghatana raat 12 baje se pehle ghati hoti to yah ek gambhir haadasa ho sakati thi
 At the time of this accident, more than 100 guests and almost the same workers were present at the accident site
 gauratlab he ki ek maheene pehle hi karol baag ke ek hotel main gambhir aag kii durghatana main 17 se adhik log maare gaye the
 Initial investigations had found that the hotel was operating following rules

 We will convey this to the central leadership
 'chaawda kaa naam liye bagaiyr alpesh ne kaha ki ek vyakti apane kaam se janaa jaataa he na ki us pad se jis par vah he
 Chavda is related to former state Congress president Bharat Singh Solanki

 ' Something like you have never seen before - prosthetics for my next amazing project # sunnyleonea post shared by Sunny Leone (@sunnyleone) on Sep 18, 2017 at 8:52 am pdttrying to find my inner zen !!! a post shared by Sunny Leone ( @sunnyleone) on Sep 18, 2017 at 9:18 am PDT bollywood badshaah shahrukh khan kii haalia relies film 'dilavaale' ko chaahe critics ke rivyuu achche nahin mili hai lekin box offis par yah film shandaar kamai kar rahi he
 Shah Rukh is also very excited about this, but Shah Rukh has not considered it appropriate to know the reactions of film critics
 'star dust awords'ke dauraan shahrukh ne bataaya, 'popular filmon main aisi bahut sari chijen shaamil hoti hai jo aalochanatmak or kalatmak prashansa se pare hote hai
 But according to me the audience likes such films
 aalochak meri filmon ko pasand karen yaa na karen, main khush hum
 Although i have not read the review of this film
 'unhone kaha, 'hamane is film ko ek lakshya ke tahat banaaya tha, jo hamaare darshak hai
 i am happy if they like it
 ' 'dilavaale' ne kuch nakaaratmak samikshaon ke baad bhi jabardast kamai kii he
 However, it is less compared to Shah Rukh's previous films
 film pratikrayaon par shahrukh ne kaha, 'main acha mahasoos kar rahaa hum
 We want to do better than this so that the whole family can come to theaters to watch the film without hesitation
 maine yah film puure parivaar ke liye banaai he
 Shah Rukh Khan, Varun Dhawan, Kajol and Kriti Sanon had important roles in the film 'dilwale'
 padhein dilavaale se judi baaki khabarempakistan box offis par 'dilavaale' kar rahi he dhamalpakistani box offis par superstar shahrukh khan kii film 'dilavaale' sanjay lila bhansaali kii film 'bajirao mastaani' kii tulana main behatar kamai kar rahi he
 Rohit Shetty directed 'dilwale' by the end of the first week of release 6
 5 karod rupee kamaaye vahiin ranvir singh-deepika padukon starer film 'bajirao mastaani' ne ab tak 2
 1 crore earned
 haalanki vitarakon kii maane to ab logon kaa jhukaav 'bajirao mastaani ' kii taraf zyada dekha ja rahaa he
 Movie Review: Bin Dil Ke 'dilwale'rating: 2 Star Artist: Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Varun Dhawan, Kriti Sanon, Director: Rohit Shettiham Sharif What happened the world went rogue
 
 
 yah'dilavaale'kaa shahrukh kaa vah dialog he, jisane film ke trailor ko hit banane main ahm role adaa kiya tha
 Expectations were raised
 lekin film dekhakar yahi laga ki shahrukh aap rohit shetty ke baari-bharkam record par kya mar-mite filmon ko lekar aapaki chois hi gadabada gai
 There is also a point that when our superstars are entering the 50th year of age, they should not be trying to revive their two-three decade old avatars
 isiilie 'dar', 'baazeegar', 'chak de
 
 ' jaisi behtareen filmein dene vaale shahrukh khan ko ab apane 'raaj' avatar se nikalne kii koshish kerani chahie
 Then Rohit Shetty's overconfidence also appears in this film
 isliye kahani kii bajaay vah oonchi-lambii kaaron par zyada jor dete dikh
 The comedy side was also weak this time
 is hafte relies hui 'bajirao mastaani' ko dekhne ke baad'dilavaale'ko dekhnaa kuch aisa hi he jaise desi ghi kaa jaayakedaar khaanaa khaane ke baad kaduve tel kii mithai khaanaa
 How much Damsharukh (raj) and Kajol (meera) meet in the story and then both get tied up in Ishq's door
 vah mafia parivaar se hai
 The love of both is rising, but something happens that both of them are separated
 pandrah saal baad phir se in do diwaanon kii kahani shuru hoti he
 This time Shahrukh and Kajol's siblings Varun (veer) and Kriti (ishita) play an important role in furthering this story
 varun or kriti main pyaar hoga to bade bhai bahan kaise chhot jaaenge
 In this way, the lovers who fall apart collide again
 lekin bulgaria se kahani goa tak pahunch chuki hoti he
 The story of the film is something that it seems that after seeing many films, took ideas from them and put them in the mixie and made a new formula
 lekin yah formula yaa shaike puri tarah se beswad he
 Star appeals Shah Rukh Khan looks good, but his bearded look is more fun, and he is very much into action
 unke vanaliner mjedaar hai
 He has only a slightly stronger side of this weak story
 jahaan tak batkajolki he to vah film main bahut hi ausat lagi hai or ab vah simran jaisaa kamaal karti kahin najar nahin aati he
 Of course, Shah Rukh of fifty and Kajol's pair of 40 now no longer hold the same magic as before
 phir varun dhawan sirf chote bhai hi banakar rah gaye hai
 Varun should think before doing such a weak character
 vahiin kriti sinan kaaphi ummiden jagaati hai, film main unke karne ke liye kuch nahin he
 Sanjay Mishra tickles but Baman Irani is boring
 kamai kii batshahrukhsaal bhar baad laute hai lekin ghisi-pity kahani ke saath
 Of course he spent Rs 100 crore
 se zyada kii apni is film kii tufaani marketing kii he or film ko kaamyaab banane ke liye puri shiddat se mehnat bhi kii he
 Prior to this, his film 'happy New Year' was also very weak in terms of story, but the film did well
 dilavaale bhi kahani or anya morchon par bahut ummid nahin jagaati he
 But such films are only damaging Shahrukh's image
 yah baat saaf he ki box offis par bahut bade chamatkaar karne kii 'dilavaale' kii raah main'bajirao mastaani'sabase bada roda he
 Both the Uttar Pradesh State Entrance Test Examination (UPSEE) and the National Defense Academy (NDA) exam are scheduled to be held on April 19
 is kaaran se kai students kii pareshaaniyon bad gai hai
 The UPSEE exam is conducted by Uttar Pradesh Technical University (UPTU)
 19 april ko yah beatech, biark or biene course kii pariksha yojit hone vaali he
 At the same time, NDA exam is conducted by UPSC
 yah pariksha indian army, air force or navy main ummidavaaron ke chayan ke liye hoti he
 Both UPSC and UPTU have ruled out the possibility of changing the exam date
 agar pariksha tay taarikh par hi hoti he to un students ko nuksaan uthaanaa padegaa jinhone donon hi jagah aavedan kiya tha
 The case of violence against students protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Jamia University in Delhi is getting heated
 iske khilaaf desh kii kai uniwarsity pradarshan kar rahi hai
 On the Agenda Aaj Tak 2019, Ayushman Khurana has given a statement on the protests and violence on students
 ayushmankhurana ne kaha- ''is halaat main maine ek twit kiya tha jo logon ko laga ki kaaphi sanitimed he
 i was trolled on both sides of the tweet
 mujhe samaj nahin aayaa ki kya kahana chaah rahe hai
 But let me say that i have also been a student
 desh kaa bhavishya hi nahin vartmaan bhi student ke haath main hai
 They want to say something thoughtfully
 lekin haa ye gandhi kaa desh he
 We have been given freedom of expression
 jo ahimsa ke saath aage rakhni chahie
 "ayushman further said-" It is also the responsibility of the government that there should not be a communication gap between the students and whatever bill they are bringing
 wo kya kahana chaahate hai wo sarkaar ko dekhnaa chahie
 If students feel that minorities are not feeling safe, then the government should know the reason behind this
 ye dekhnaa bahut jaruri he
 "what was written by Ayushman in the tweet? Ayushman wrote in tweet - i am very sad about the students going through the situation
" main isaki ninda karata hum
 We all have the right to protest
 hamen abhivyakti kii aazaadee kaa istemaal karne kaa haq he
 However, protests cannot be fierce
 aise pradarshan nahin hone chahie jisase public property ko nuksaan pahunche
 My dear countrymen, this is Gandhi's land
 chizon ko express karne ke liye ahimsa hamaara hathiyaar hona chahie
 Trust democracy

 There is nothing wrong with these cow smugglers

 Everything is just money for them
 yahaan pashu mandiyon main ek gaay kii ausat keemat 55 hajaar rupee tak hoti he
 After crossing the Assam border, the price of cow in Bangladesh becomes up to 1 lakh rupees
 aisa isliye he kyonki bangladesh main gomance kii kaaphi demand he

 In such a situation, BJP feels that the matter is political, they also say that if the people of BJP have stolen, then why did the Congress government give Krishi Karman Awards at the Center
 purv sahakaarita mantri or narela se bijepi vidhayak vishwaas saarang ne kaha jab manmohan singh kii sarkaar thi usee vakt bijepi ko krishi karman aword mila lagaataar 5-7 dafe, jiskaa matlab he hamane sahi kiya, utpaadan badha to nakli khaad beej se kaise badha

 The issue of non-standard fertilizer and seeds is not a problem in Madhya Pradesh, but the government believes that the Seed Bill 2019 can be a solution, increasing the amount of fine on companies selling seeds of poor quality to a maximum of 5
 Lakhs are proposed to be raised while as of now it is 500 rupees (minimum) and 5,000 rupees (maximum)

 If passed, it will replace the nearly five-decade old Seeds Act, 1966, claiming that this will increase agricultural productivity in the country by about 25 percent
 ye adhinium bijon ke utpaadan, vitaran or bikri ko niyamit karne par jor detaa he
 Through this, the government is in the process of implementing changes like uniform certification for all seeds and barcoding of seeds
 lekin bill kaa virodh karne vaale ise chote kisaanon ke liye nuksaandeh badi companiyon ke liye phydemand maanate hai, kyonki panjiyan ko anivaary karne se chote kisaan beej-vyapaar ke bazaar main ghus nahin paaegaa
 Where it currently holds more than 70 per cent

 It is also being said that the proposed bill will turn research into farming into a monopoly of companies and patent holders

 On the other hand, if i grow a breeder, then i will come to the foundation, from foundation to C-1, to C-2, 87 per cent holdings are small where one farmer buys seeds from another, one lakh
 Punishment of Rs 5 lakh will be fine, but the question is, who will certify that there is no place to do genetic purity test
 jaankaar kehete hai ki desh main 45 fisadi beej hi aise hai jo bhartiya krishi anusandhan parishad se pramanit hote hai
 About 55 percent of the seeds sold by private companies are not certified, the action of the Madhya Pradesh government suggests that these numbers are much higher, that too when the seed development corporation and marketing at the state and national level to provide better fertilizer and improved seeds to the farmers Institutions like the Sangh have been formed, but many times the government machinery is also forced to take seeds from the market and sell them by putting their seal on them

 '' badalte daur main yoga logon kii jarurat ke taur par ubhar rahaa he
 Due to increasing interest of people in yoga, there is a demand for many books based on it
 ve log jo kisi prashikshit trainer kii madad nahin le sakate, unke liye tamaam prakashkon kii kitaaben maujuud hai
 Another book has come in this episode, which is attracting attention of people due to its simple presentation
 ham baat kar rahe hai "yoga shakti" kii
 It is written by Shailaja Menon
 shailaja philhal malaysia main yoga prashikshak ke taur par mashhoor hai
 He also has his own studio
 yoga aisa vishay he jiske bare main log sahi-sahi nahin jaan pate
 Most take it as a "class"
 ek tarah se dekhen to jise jo mil gaya, vah usee se kaam chalaa rahaa he
 But Shailaja's book published from Niyogi Books can be useful for such people
 179 pej kii kitaab main shailaja ne jivan main yoga ke mahatv, laabh or har us shankaa ke samaadhaan kii koshish kii he, jo yoga prashikshuon ke liye abujh paheli kii tarah hai
 Like- there is a propaganda about yoga that it is not possible without the help of a trainer! a solution can be found in Shailaja's book
 motaape se paaen chhutkaaraa, karen ye yogasanakitab main aise or tamaam sawaalon ke jawaab hai jo baar-baar puche jate hai
 For example, what are the benefits of yoga? How does its practice provide mental-spiritual peace? How does the body benefit? How important are postures? What is the correct way to do an asana? Shailaja has tried to answer dozens of such questions
 haalanki kitaab kii bhashaa angreji he
 But the handwriting, the flow of simple language and the presentation of rugs in pictures make it a book of great work
 darasal, shailaja ne yoga kii gaharaai ko saadhaaran tareeke se samajhane kii koshish kii he
 He has tried to contain yoga infinite esotericism
 kitaab kai adhyay main baantkar likhi gai he
 Not only do we analyze yoga rugs in simple language, they also portray it through photographs
 script ke saath tasveeron ke hone se koi bhi aasaani se yoga ke alag-alag asana kii sahi-sahi avasthaa main abhyaas kar saktaa he
 It also contains instructions regarding the utility of rugs
 har roj karne chahie ye 5 yogasanakitab main ek jagah shailaja bataati hai ki aaj ke daur main kaise yoga kii shakti se koi vyakti, vyaadhimukt ho jaataa he
 Negative experiences such as anger, stress, restlessness, excitement, all come to an end within a person
 darasal, aisi avasthaa main hi koi vyakti taazgi mahasoos karata he
 This is also the goal of yoga
 yoga ke isi mahatv ko pustak main bataane kii koshish kii gai he
 Shailaja emphasizes that in today's time it is very important to adopt yoga
 kitaab ke tamaam adhyyon se guzarate hue mahasoos hota he ki wo aisa kyon kah rahi hai
 Shailaja Menon's love and passion for yoga is also clearly visible in this book
 yoga se unke swayan kii jivan yatra par kis tarah se prabhaav pade hai, iske anubhav preranadayak hai
 This book will prove to change the attitude of people towards Yoga

 bhartiya haikar ne FB ap main gambhir khami dhundhi hefesbuk or google ne haikar ko diya puraskarafasebuk or duusare eps main khami dhundne ke maamle main bhartiya havers kaaphi aage hai
 One such Indian hacker, Rahul Kankrale, has exposed the major drawbacks of Facebook

 After finding serious flaws in Facebook, Facebook has given reward under the bug bounty program
 ajtak tech se baatcheet ke dauraan unhone bataaya he ki fasebuk kii is gambhir khami kii vajah se karodon fasebuk yugers prabhavit ho sakate the
 Facebook has now rectified this flaw and replaced it with about $ 33000 (approximately 23)
 63 lakh rupee) kaa inaam mila he
 Not only this, Google has also rewarded them for finding the same flaw in the Facebook app
 gauratlab he ki fasebuk kii ye khami android smartphone main thi
 In Facebook Permissions, Khami has found him along with Dmitry Lukyanenko, a hacker from Belarus and for this he got 7,500 dollars
 fasebuk main ye thi khamirahul ke mutabik is khami ke jariye unhone fasebuk ap ke liye android parmishan ko bypass kar liya

 rahul kaa kahana he ki fasebuk ke mukhya ap main parmishan ko lekar kuch galtiyaan thi jisaki vajah se wo kisi fasebuk yujar ke saath bina uski parmishan ke video colling kar sakate the
 For example, you have Facebook app and someone sends you a link and as soon as you click on this link the next person can see you from your front camera and you will not even be aware of this
 kyonki ye kaam bina massenger ke interaction ke ho rahaa tha
 Such a flaw may prove more serious about privacy
 kyonki isse front camere kaa acces aasaani se liya ja saktaa he
 The disturbing thing is that the target user is not even aware that someone is watching them
 gauratlab he ki android ko is tarah se dizin kiya jaataa he ki wo duusare parmited eps ke saath inter ap communication kar sakate hai
 It is also called as inter process communication
 isi tarah kaa maikenism android par chalane vaale fasebuk or massenger ap ke bich bhi hota he Even well-intentioned experts, who predict election results, often go wrong, in such a situation that if a new leader comes into politics to predict the results very accurately, then everyone's vigilance becomes huge

 Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan is now on target of his loved ones regarding Pulwama terror attack
 purv raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari ne imran kii aalochana karte hue unhen aparipakv qaraar diya
 He said that Imran does not know how to handle international politics
 asif ali jaradaari ne kaha ki mere kaarykaal ke dauraan mumbai ke taj hotel par hamalaa kiya gaya tha, lekin phir hamane is mudde ko sauhardrapurn dhang se sambhala
 This time the Prime Minister (imran Khan) is very immature
 unhen nahin pataa ki kya karnaa he
 He is actually a back seat driver and is acting at the behest of others, so the situation is getting worse
 unhone kaha ki ham ab bhi pakistan sena kaa samarthan karte hai or agar bharat ne hamaare khilaaf koi galat kaam karne kii yojana banaai he, to ham ek saath rahenge or iske khilaaf ladenge
 This is not the first time Zardari has criticized Imran Khan
 isse pehle, jab khan ne agast, 2018 main satta sanbhali, to jaradaari ne kaha ki vah apana sanvaidhanik paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa nahin karenge
 Zardari said sit down and think about the government
 ab jab aap ek aakasmik, chaynit pradhanmantri ban gaye hai, to kuch seekhen
 PPP President and Zardari's son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also said that Imran Khan did not have the courage to speak face to face during the Parliament session
 iske jawaab main imran khan ne kaha tha ki jaradaari pakistan kii sabase badi beemaari hai
 Let me tell you, when Mumbai was attacked by lashkar-e-taiba (let) in 2008, Asif Ali Zardari was the President of Pakistan
 is hamale ke baad bharat ne pakistan ke rahane vaale aatanki ajmal qasaab ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 After his arrest, it was clear that Pakistan is using its land for terrorist organizations like Lashkar
 us samay jaradaari ne tatkaaleen america videsh mantri condolija rice se vaada kiya tha ki unki sarkaar mumbai hamalon main pakistani sanlipta ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karegi
 At the same time, Imran Khan has categorically rejected Islamabad's involvement after the Pulwama terror attack
 19 farvari ko imran khan ne kaha ki agar bharat, pakistan ke khilaaf koi karrwai karata he to unka desh taiyaar he
 During his speech, Imran did not express any condolences to the soldiers who were martyred in Pulwama
 bataa den, 14 farvari ko jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatanki hamale main 40 se adhik siarpief jawan shahid ho gaye the
 jaish-e-mohammed took responsibility for this attack
 iskaa sargana masood ajahar pakistan main rahata he

 Kejriwal will attack Khurshid through a big rally in Farurkhabad
 salmaan khurshid ke enjio main farjiwade ke khilaaf arvind kejariwal ne jhanda uthaaya hua he
 Kejriwal's press conference has created a ruckus, scandalous atmosphere and Arvind Kejriwal has already made it clear that he will ask for the account of Baisakhio in Farrukhabad but before that he will answer every Farrukhabad resident's question
 udhar congress ne kejariwal se sawaalon ko lekar list taiyaar kar lee he

 Claims of strong security arrangements are being made

 Apparently due to all these tricks, Farrukhabad seems to be a big political arena

 Along with this, infrastructure is a major problem facing e-vehicles

 Also, customers change their mind after hearing their expensive price
 yahi kaaran he ki bharat main bikne vaale kul vaahanon main se electric vaahanon kii hissedari mahaj 1 fisadi se bhi kam he
 In such a situation, to announce this golden future of the auto industry, big announcements can be seen in the budget this time

 Pakistan sends arms to India via drone via Punjab and it is feared that Pakistan may carry out major terrorist attacks
 punjab main pichley kuch dinon se pakistan se drone aane kii khabar aati rahi he
 Actually Pakistan sends fake notes, weapons and ammunition via drone
 sitambar maheene main tarantaaran ke bhikhivind road par chhabal ilaake ke ek chaaval godaam main aadha jala hua drone mila tha
 This drone had GPS, which could carry up to ten kg
 police jaanch main khulaasa hua ki is drone ne aath baar udaan bhari he
 Certainly this news is very serious for India in terms of security
 jiske baad rashtriya jaanch agency (NIA) ne grih mantralai ke nirdesh par 'special 26' naam se ek team gathit kii
 Which is investigating Pakistan sending arms via drone to Tarn Taran in Punjab
 NIA kii yah sikret team 18 november ko punjab ke tarantaaran pahunchi
 He began investigating the case
 NIA kii 'special 26' team ne pehle se maamle kii jaanch kar rahe police adhikariyon se bhi mulaakaat kii
 So that the specifics of the case can be understood
 sutron kii maane to NIA kii team ne tarantaaran ke kai ilaaqon main chhapemari kii he lekin isse sambandhit koi bhi jaankaree abhi tak saarvajinak nahin kii gai he
 Apparently, the whole matter is related to national security and international terrorist network
 aise main NIA chhapemari yaa poochtacha se judi kisi bhi baat ko saamne nahin rakh rahi he
 According to the latest information, 6 terrorists have been arrested in Tarn Taran case
 punjab kii rajya oparation cell ikai ne germany main baithe gurmeet singh urf bagga ke bhai ko bhi giraftaar kiya he
 He has been arrested from Jalandhar
 sutron ke mutabik aatankiyon ne poochtacha main khulaasa kiya he ki kashmir main hathiyaar nahin pahunch rahaa he
 In such a situation, terrorists have ordered a major attack in Delhi or Punjab
 zaahir he seemapar baithkar aatank kii saazish rachane kii yah dastaan neend udaane vaali he
 So the NIA team is trying to know from the terrorists that the terrorists sitting in Pakistan are not using Khalistani terrorists to send weapons
 , Flew eight times from Pakistan to unload ammunition and fake currency
 pakistan se aayaa ye drone ek baar main 10 kilo tak vajan uthaa saktaa he
 Through this came five AK-47 rifles, 16 magazines and 472 rounds of ammunition, four China-made
 30 bor pistaul, aath magazine or 72 round gola barood ke saath, nau hand grenade, unke sahaayak upkaran ke saath paanch satellite phone, do mobile phone, do wireles set or 10 laakh rupee ke ankit mulya vaali naqli mudra punjab police kii special unit ne jabt kii thi
 According to the Punjab Police, these weapons were to be used to spread terror in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir
 ab NIA is puure maamle kii jaanch karne main juty he or ye pataa lagane kii koshish main he ki in hathiyaaron kaa istemaal kya pakistan kii agenciyaan karne vaali thi? The American official further said that we do not have any dilemma that Pakistan military intelligence agencies help these terrorist groups
 isliye ham thos kadam kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 On the condition of anonymity, the officer further said that we have seen that Pakistan has seized the properties of some terrorist groups and it is also true that Hafiz Saeed has been arrested who is accused of the 2008 Mumbai attack
 lekin uski giraftaar 7 baar ho chuki he or phir baad main chhod diya gaya
 Therefore, our stand is very clear about his arrest
 aapako bataa den ki pakistan ke punjab praant ke aatankwaad rodhi vibhaag (sitidi) ne mumbai aatankwaadi hamale ke mastermind evam pratibandhit sanghathan jamaat-ud-daawa (jeyudi) ke sargana hafiz said ko aatankwaad ke vitt poshan ke aaropon main buudhvaar ko giraftaar kiya
 The action has been taken a few days before Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan's first visit to the US
 sitidi ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki said aatankwaad vittaposhan ko lekar uske khilaaf darj maamle main agrim jamaanat ke liye lahore se gujranvala ja rahaa tha, tabhi use giraftaar kar liya gaya

 The police also found Sandeep's hair in Arvind's hands, which became an important clue in the case
 police isaki forencik jaanch bhi karvaa rahi he
 In this way, the matter was resolved by the police in 4 days
 log ab log nahin rahe
 People are now becoming political party people
 is tasviir main chand log najar aa rahe hai jo abhi tak log hai
 None of the parties are made
 isliye inke liye koi log nahin hai
 i kept watching some people sitting on top of the well for a long time
 jabaki najar jaani chahie thi kuen main tairti dikh rahi mahila par
 Whose back is up and stomach is under water
 pani bharne ai thi is kuen main
 The feet slipped and she drowned in the same water she had gone to save herself
 paas baithe log pani ke bare main soch rahe honge yaa aurat ke bare main? It is not about whom to blame
 dosha sab par madhe ja chuke hai
 Now we are blaming each other
 kahin chup rahane or kahin bolne ke aarope laga rahe hai
 We have seen how many pictures of such wells
 kabhi kisi ko khyal aayaa ki is tarah ke kachche kuen jaanaleva ho sakate hai
 Getting down and filling water is like risking life
 koi to ejeeniyar hoga, koi aisa afasar hoga jo soch saktaa tha ki kuen ko kaise surakshit banaaya jaae
 Why does no one see the society, sarpanch, journalists, politicians that such wells can be fatal
 koi pani bharne ke liye puliya hi laga detaa
 We are not all people, so it is not visible
 ham dal ke log ho gaye hai
 Such unsafe wells are proof that we are no longer people
 jo log hai ve dub kar mar rahe hai
 The woman whose corpse you see floating in this well is forty years old Satyabhama Chhagan Kadam
 do bete or ek beti kii maa
 Obviously the children will be younger
 gaanv main tanker nahin aa rahaa tha
 Satyabhama came to take water from this well one and a half kilometers away
 aaj aakhri ummid lekar ghar se chali hogi ki vahaan to pani mil jayega
 Going there, his feet slipped
 police ne durghatanavash maut kaa maamla darj kar liya he
 This incident is from Beed district of Maharashtra
 patoda taluka ke saundana gaanv kii he
 i am not referring to the presence or absence of any selective outrage

 Before the elections in Madhya Pradesh, the activism of Union Minister of State for Power Jyotiraditya Scindia is growing rapidly outside the gwalior-chambal division
 unki is sakriyata ke siyaasi myne hai
 For a long time, the talk of handing over the command of the state to Scindia by the party is in the political corridor
 congress ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh kii jimmedaari rahul gandhi ke sanbhaalane ke baad unki yuva brigade kaa rutaba badhanaa tay he
 Scindia is also counted among leaders close to Rahul Gandhi
 gandhi aagaamee vidhansabha chunaav main rajya main congress kii satta main vaapasi har keemat par chaahate hai
 For this, he has also instructed all the leaders to forget the factionalism
 party sutron par bharosa karen to sindhiya par party daanv lagane ko taiyaar he
 It is a different matter that before the elections, the party is not going to declare the chief ministerial candidate
 party kii ranneeti ke mutabik sindhiya rajya ke kai hisson main rajeev gandhi vidyutikaran yojana ke vistaar ke naam par daura karenge
 Malwa has also made its debut with the Nimad tour
 sindhiya par daanv lagane kii vajah bhi hai
 Scindia is not in any dispute
 yuva va urjawan hai
 Keep your talk clearly itnaa hi nahin unke pita swargeey madhavrao sindhiya kaa bhi raajnneeti main dakhal rahaa he
 His image has also been of a clean leader
 iske alaava sindhiya rajgaraane par virdohi dal bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke liye aarope lagaana aasaan nahin he, kyonki unki daadi vijayaraaje sindhiya bijepi kii neenv rakhane vaale netaaon main se ek rahi hai
 Sources say that Scindia wants to keep away from the factionalism going on in the party
 unki yah bhi koshish rahegi ki jis ilaake main jaaen vahaan ke sabhi gut ke kaaryakarta unase juden
 This is why they are confident of touring alone rather than taking someone else along
 yahi silsilaa aage bhi jari rahegaa
 Scindia made it clear during the stormy tour from Sehore to Shajapur, Ratlam and Mandsaur on Sunday and Monday that the party's strength was his priority
 unke in kaaryakramon ke dauraan ve netaa bhi najar aae jinaki nishtha kisi duusare netaa ke prati jag jaahir he
 He does not miss trying to put a stop to the questions arising from all sides about activism
 samvaadadaataaon ko congress kii ore se mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaae jane ke sawaal par kaha ki ve khud in atakalon par viraam lagaate hai
 They are small party workers and will work to strengthen the party

 Ad-filmmaker Lloyd Baptista is going to remake the 1983 film 'sadma' starring Kamal Haasan and Sridevi
 baaluu mahendra ke nirdesan main bani 'sadma' bhi darasal tamil film 'mundaram pirai' kaa rimek thi, jisamen shridevi abhinit charitra ke sir main chot lagane ke baad ek bacchee jaisaa vyavhaar karne lagati he

 '' Lloyd Baptista reports that casting director Mukesh Chabhara is working on the film and is in talks with some of the lead actors to play the lead roles
 camel hasan ne tamil film main apni bhoomika par rashtriya puraskaar hasil kiya tha
 He said, "we have had brief conversations with some big actors, because it will be difficult to replace Kamal Haasan and Sridevi
" 
 
 ''tippaniyan Maybe, some changes will be made in the atmosphere of the original story of the film, so that it seems relevant in today's era, but Baptista is yet to decide

 mujhe lagata he ki vartmaan peedi ke jo log pyaar main yakeen nahin rakhte, unhen 'sadma' jaisi filmein dekhni chahie
 
 
 '' loyad bapatista ne bataaya ki casting nirdeshak mukesh chabhra film par kaam kar rahe hai or mukhya bhoomikaayen nibhaane ke liye vah kuch pramukh abhinaytaon ke saath baatcheet kar rahe hai
 Kamal Haasan won the National Award for his role in the Tamil film
 unhone bataaya, ''hamane kuch bade abhinaytaon ke saath sankshipt baatcheet kii he, kyonki camel hasan or shridevi kaa sthaan le paanaa mushkil hoga

 " West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee thundered at Arvind Kejriwal's rally in Delhi today
 unhone piem narendra modi or bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah par jamkar waar kiya
 Banning Mamata, sending CBI to Kolkata, said that send you CBI to us, i will cook and feed with my own hand
 mamata ne 56 inch kii chaati par bhi tanj kiya
 He said that the 56-inch chest was also of Ravana
 modi dobaaraa na aae, iske liye sari qurbaani dengeam aadmi party kii taanaashaahee hataao, loktantr bachaao raily main aaj mamata banerjee ne khulkar modi sarkaar par waar kiya
 Mamta made a big attack on PM Modi and Shah and said that those who drank the blood of the people are ruling the country
 hamen gujarat kaa din yaad he
 Mamta said while taunting that send CBI people, they will cook and feed with their hands
 mamata ne kaha ki aaie united bharat banaaen
 Democracy has now become a Modi democracy
 apatkaal se bhi bhayanak sthiti he
 Mamta made it clear that there will be a fight between us and the left in the state, but nationally we will fight together
 ham apane saare hiton ko bhulane ke liye taiyaar hai
 Modi did not come again
 iske liye ham sari qurbaaniyaan dene ko taiyaar hai
 Where the party is strong, the fight fought with this rally gave a big message to the Congress
 mamata ne kaha ki jo jahaan majboot he, vahaan ladaai lade
 If we are strong in Bengal, then here we will fight the BJP
 andhra pradesh main chandrababu naidu majboot hai to vahaan ve bijepi se ladenge
 Similarly, if Aam Aadmi Party is strong in Delhi, then only AAP should be allowed to fight there
 upi main samaajawaadee party majboot he to vahaan vahi lade
 Mamta's message to Congress, don't cut votes Mamata reiterated Farooq Abdullah saying that we have to sacrifice
 ham chahen to ham bhi madhya pradesh or rajasthan main lard sakate hai, lekin ham aisa nahin kehete, balki ham congress se kehete hai ki aap madhya pradesh, rajasthan or chhattisgarh kii ladaai laden
 Fight where we are strong
 bijepi ko phayda pahunchane ke liye vot mat kaatie
 Mamta claimed that irrespective of the battle the BJP fought, TMC would get 42 seats out of 42 in Bengal
 bengal main agar left or congress milakar bhi ladate hai to sari siten mujhe hi milengi
 Calling Modi and Shah Sholay's Gabbar, Mamta repeated the dialogue of Sholay, calling BJP President Amit Shah and PM Narendra Modi Gabbar
 mamata ne ‘so ja varanaa gabbar singh aa jayega’ kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki ab media, netaa or industry waalon ko kehete hai ki gabbar singh aa jayega
 Not even recognizing Narendra Modi in Gujarat, Mamata said, "I went to Parliament with my mps and said sorry to Bapuji and remove BJP
" desh kaa netaa gandhi or ambedkar jaisaa hota he, subhash chandra bose jaisaa hota he
 Mamta said that now even Gujarat will not recognize you
 janata aapako gujarat bhi jane kaa mauka nahin degi
 Mamta said that you say there is a 56 inch chest
 56 inch kii chaati to ravan kii bhi thi
 Mamta said that at this time everyone's phone is on surveillance
 saare netaaon yahaan tak ki bijepi ke mantriyon par bhi najar rakhi ja rahi he

 sahaj or shant pravriti ke joshi bijepi par paini najar rakhte hai
 Prominent correspondent Santosh Kumar talked to him about the dwindling presence in the branch, the Sangh's thinking and the BJP
 pesh he uske anshkbadalte jamaane ke saath aadhunik daur main aresas khud ko kahaan dekhtaa he?ham hameshaa kehete aae hai ki kisi bhi prakaar kii paristhitiyaan ho, sangh jo kaary karnaa chahta he, uski aavashyaktaa nirantar bani rahane vaali he
 Our three objectives are: Organization of Hindu society, sacrament of pure life in Hindu society and awakening in the context of the country and working continuously for our society
 hamaare saadhan badalenge, ham aaj ke jamaane ke anukool kaaryakramon kii yojana banaaenge, kuch paddatiyaan jodenge, kuch puraani paddatiyaan chodenge
 But we don't think there is any need to think about objectives
 sangh ne soshal site par bhi shakha kii anumati di he, kya sangh kii shakhaon main logon kii upasthiti kam ho gai he?soshal site par shakhaaen bharat ke andar shuru nahin kin
 Some volunteers who have gone abroad have done such experiments
 main maanata hum ki shakha chalaane ke liye mehnat kerani padati he
 Changing lifestyles, changes in education system have had an impact on the whole life of the society as well as some Sangh branch
 lekin saare aankade dekhen to hamaare kaam main kahin kami nahin ai he
 Sometimes there is a slight pause
 gat do-teen varsh main college chaatro kii shakha kii sankhya badi he
 The branch's experiments are being successful by looking at the routines of IT students
 20 din vaale training camp main salanaa 40 varsh se kam umr ke 15,000 log aate hai
 Yes, there is little effect, but we work hard for it and will come out of it quickly
 haal hi main sarkaar ke aarthik faislon ko sangh kis tarah dekhtaa he?iske bare main hamaari teen-chaar baaten hai
 We do not consider emulation of other countries right in the name of development
 hamen apane desh kii jarurat or samaaj kii maansikta ko dhyaan main rakhkar aarthik vikaas kii baat kerani chahie
 Small industry and retail businesses will be affected by FDI
 kai rajya sarkaron ne use nakaara he
 The government should find the reason for this
 sirf sudhaar yaa vikaas ke naam par apane desh ke hit kii andekhi nahin kerani chahie
 What are the major challenges facing the country in the eyes of the RSS? If we look at the economic sector, then the common people are deprived of bread and cloth and houses
 35-40 karod janata garib he
 We should think about the last person in the society
 berogari unmoolan ke liye pramanik prayaas hon

 Things like chemical fertilizers came in the name of Green Revolution, due to which the fertility of agriculture has decreased
 kisaan or laghu udyog ko nai takanic sikhaaen, udyog vikendrikrut hon
 Why support Anna's movement on corruption initially and later distance? We did not take any decision keeping Anna in front
 puttur main hamaari baithak hui anna andolan se pehle
 In 2011, the All India House of Representatives decided that whatever movement of corruption will happen, the swayamsevak will go there
 jab anna ne aahvaan kiya to hamaare log gaye
 But later questions were raised about the participation of the Sangh
 durbhaagya se anna bhi prabhavit hue or kaha ki hamen sangh kaa sahyog nahin chahie, iskaa asar padataa he
 We feel that such a movement which is in the interest of the country should be done jointly, otherwise good movements also fall apart
 isliye ye andolan bikharaa hua rahaa
 What is the reason behind the lack of political will in dealing with corruption, is any political party better? The problem is not just political
 rajnatik ichhashakti prabal honi hi chahie
 Corruption is done only by those in power
 jab koi andolan khadaa hota he tab kasuti par dal hote hai
 There may be another political party in the future that works on the basis of willpower
 aise dal khadey nahin honge aisa hamen nahin lagata
 bjp's national president was also accused, how do we see? The charge has not been leveled against BJP
 media main jo aarope lage hai kai prakaar ke mulyon kaa jab ksharan hota he to uske parinaam sabhi saamaajik jivan main dikhaai dete hai
 If you talk about the criterion, shouldn't Gadkari be tested? us kasuti par ve utarane kii koshish karenge
 In such a situation, they should be given another term? We do not have any opinion about this
 bijepi uske bare main akalan kare, unako lagata he to nirnay karen
 The Sangh has no role in that
 ram mandir masale par deree se aapke cader main niraashaa he, kya kahenge?hamaare sabhi str par jo iske liye kaam karne vaale hai, unamem koi niraashaa nahin he
 There is definitely apprehension among those watching from afar
 hycourt ke nirnay se kaaryakartaaon kaa vishwaas badha he
 Right now the case is going on in the Supreme Court, so we will see the way
 ek seemaa tak raah dekhenge
 We feel that once the need for environment in the country is created, the movement will stand if it is needed
 hamaare man main koi ashanka nahin he
 Right now the court process is going on, so the activists are calm
 iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki man se vishay samaapt hua
 There has been a controversy over the interference of the Sangh in the bjp's functioning, as Advani himself said in Chennai after the Jinnah episode? i think the wrong perception must have gone at that time
 apane nirnay vahi karte hai
 It is wrong to interfere with everyday work
 haa, jinna prakaran ke samay jarur hamane apni asahmati prakat kii or logon ne nirnay kiya ki unhen (adwani) adhyaksh ke daayitv main nahin rahanaa chahie
 If one opportunity is omitted, i do not think that the Sangh is interfering in the daily work
 sangh kii bhoomika simit rahi he
 If we go into history then why BJP was formed
 sangh ke mudde par hi jansangh janata party se alag hua, isliye kuch na kuch rishte to bane hue hai
 But the relationship does not mean that the union has influence over all decisions

 The Indian government also believes this
 haalanki isi sandarbh main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki ucch shikshan sansthaaon kii rankig ke alag-alag antarrashtriya maanak hai or ye vaishvik rup se sweekaarya yaa manyata praapt nahin hai
 In a written reply to the question of Uday Singh and Prahlada Joshi in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State for Human Resource Development Shashi Tharoor said that there are several systems of ranking of higher educational institutions at international level, in which different values, standards and standards are used
 unhone kaha ki ye maanak na na to antarrashtriya str par sweekaarya hai or na na hi manyata praapt
 Many of these standards have also been criticized by academics
 tharur ne kaha ki inamen se kuch maanak bhartiya shaikshanik sansthaaon ke liye upyukt nahin he, isliye is prakaar kii ranking se nishchit taur par bhartiya shaikshanik sansthaaon kii gunvattta nirdhaarit nahin hoti he
 The Minister said that for example, research is highly valued in these rankings, whereas our universities have traditionally been institutions of education and not research institutes

 sarkaar ne yah roak uniwarsity kii ore se 25 hajaar students ko farji degree die jane kii vajah se lagaai gai he
 In this regard, the government issued an order stating that after the SOG Thanajaypur case of selling fake degrees in Jodhpur National University, the department had ordered a committee to be constituted and investigated
 jaanch ke aadhaar par yah aadesh jari kiya gaya he
 It is worth mentioning that since 2009, the University of Jodhpur has given more than 38 thousand degrees and marksheets in many courses, but out of these, about 25 thousand degrees and marksheets have turned out to be fake

 bjp's West Bengal president Dilip Ghosh has created controversy by saying that the girls of Jadavpur University are levelless and shameless
 itnaa hi nahin unhone kaha ki ye ladkiyaan hameshaa purush chaatro ke saath rahane kaa mauk dhundne main lagi rahati hai
 Ghosh said this while reacting to the allegation of molesting the students of the institute during a clash between ABVP and left-leaning students during a film screening last week
 unhone kaha ki chhedhkhani ke aarope niraadhaar hai
 The allegations which the students of Jadavpur University are making are themselves levelless and shameless and they always find a chance to be in the company of the boys

 Is it worth believing unhone kaha ki is tarah ke niraadhaar aarope sharmnaak hai

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke hastkshep ke kaaran ek sahaayak mahila professor ko yahaan ek sheersh santhaan se aakhirkaar uski gracuty mil gai
 Assistant Professor Kavita Surabhi said that she was upset about her gratuity for several months
 unhone 2007-2013 ke bich jis santhaan main kaam kiya tha, usase apni gracuty maang rahi thi
 The Prime Minister not only accepted his request, but also managed his case to a logical conclusion with the management of the college of a university in Noida
 kavita ke liye 40,000 rupee kii gracuty raashi ek badi samasya ban gai thi, kyonki lau college prabandhan isamen adnga laga rahaa tha
 He approached the accountant (accountant) to the founding member of the college, but there was no solution
 aakhirkaar unhone pradhanmantri karyaalay kaa darwaja khatkhataya or apni yachika ke sweekaar kiye jane par kaaphi khush or hairaan huin
 Kavita said, i wrote a letter to the Prime Minister in July 2014 with the hope that my problem would be heard
 kavita ko unke email par jawaab mila, jisamen unke shram ayukta se milakar samasya ke bare main bataane ko kaha gaya
 a copy of the mail was also sent to the founding member of the university
 modi ke chunaav prachaar main kiya gaya 'achche din' kaa vaada kavita ke liye tab puraa ho gaya, jab unki gracuty raashi badhkar 1
 6 lakhs and he was paid it without delay
 kanoon kii shiksha main master kii degree le rahi kavita ne bataaya ki unki khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahaa kyonki pradhanmantri ke kehane se unhen unki gracuty mil gai
 She said she would be indebted to Modi because she helped him when she lost hope
 kavita ne bataaya, isi samasya se pareshaan mere bahut se saathi ab piemo ko likh rahe hai, unhen ummid he ki unki samasya bhi suni jaaegi
 The whole world is discussing China's One belt-one Road project
 china ek nayaa silk root banane ja rahaa he
 The Silk Route has been the historical route through which trade took place for centuries and passed through all the countries of Asia, from East Asian countries to Korea and Japan to the areas around the Mediterranean Sea adjoining Europe
 ye rasta hameshaa se hi china kii aarthik khushhaali kaa zariyaa bana rahaa
 Such was the importance of this road that even a quarter of two thousand years ago, the Han Emperor of China built the China Wall to protect this road too
 isi silk root ko nae rup main taiyaar karne ke liye china ne qamar kas lee he
 Under this, work has already started in all the countries of Asia
 kahin pahaado ke neeche surangen khodi ja rahi hai, kahin badi-badi nadiyon par lambey chaude pul ban rahe hai
 Several lane highways are being built, and thousands of kilometers long railway lines are being laid
 bade-bade power plant ban rahe hai or saikadon kilometre lambii gas pipeline bichaai ja rahi hai
 This is the most ambitious project of China so far, whose budget is one trillion US dollars i
e
 seven hundred thousand rupees
 
 
 jo bharat kii kul arthvyavastha kaa qareeb ek tihaai he
 
 
 From this you can guess how ambitious and big project it is
 14 may or 15 may ko beijing main iskaa aupchaarik taur par shriganesh bhi ho gaya
 On its inauguration, the heads of 29 countries including China and representatives of 70 other countries were present
 van belt-van road china ke raashtrapati shi chinafing kaa sapana he, jiskaa makasad bataaya gaya he asian deshon ke saath china kaa sampark or sahyog behatar karnaa or africa va europe ko bhi asian deshon ke saath qareebi se jodna
 Under this project, trade routes will be improved through land and sea routes
 kai hispid rail network honge, jo europe tak jaaenge
 This route will pass through several ports in Asia and Africa and many free trade zones will come through it
 china duniya ke 65 deshon ko ek-duusare ke qareeb laaegaa or duniya kii do tihaai aabaadi ko apni arthvyavastha se sidhe jod degaa
 Economists are seeing it on the lines of the Marshall Plan that made America the world's super power after the second world war, but it is a much bigger project
 agar keemat ke lihaaz se dekha jaae to aaj kii qeemat ke hisaab se america kaa marshall plan 130 arab dollar kaa tha, jabaki china kaa project isse kai guna zyaada bada yani das kharab dollar kaa he
 Xi Chinfing described it as the Project of the Century
 ek aisi yojana jo us khaali jagah ko bharegi jo trump ke daur main america first kii policy ke tahat antarrashtriya arthvyavastha se america ke pair peeche khinchne se ban gai he
 China is trying to deepen its grip on the world economy through this
 aise samay jab china main gharelu maang kaafii ghati he to vikaas kii bhukh puri karne ke liye use duusare deshon kii ore tezi se badhanaa hi hoga or ye project uske liye bahut madadgaar sabit ho saktaa he
 China will be able to easily and cheaply deliver its products to the markets of the world through One belt-one Road
 uskaa lakshya he agle ek dashak main apana vyapaar dhai kharab dollar or badha dena
 In a way, China is going to expand its economic empire as never seen or heard before
 
 
 lekin bharat ke lihaaz se sabase khaas baat ye he ki bharat iskaa hissaa nahin ban rahaa
 
 
 India and Bhutan remain the only countries in South Asia that did not join
 bhutan ke saath to china ke rajanyik sambandh bhi nahin hai, lekin bharat isse kyon nahin judaa
 
 
 India has cleared the reason for this
 uskaa kahana he ki ye project uski samprabhutaa kaa ulanghan karata he
 
 
 The Indian Ministry of External Affairs has issued a statement on the issue saying that no country can accept a project that negates its concerns of sovereignty and territorial integrity
 darasal, van belt-van road us china-pakistan iconomic koridor yani china-pakistan aarthik galiyare se guzarataa he, jo pakistan ke kabze vaale kashmir main padataa he
 India considers it its part and has expressed reservations over China's involvement in economic activities in the region
 is ilaake main buniyadi dhaanche ko behatar karne ke liye china ab tak 46 arab dollar kaa nivesh bhi kar chukaa he, jis par bharat lagaataar aitaraaz jataata rahaa he
 The question is whether India will suffer due to being out of One belt-one Road project
 
 
 kya bharat duniya kii arthvyavastha main alag-thalag pad jayega
 Many experts believe that this is not the case
 duniya kii arthvyavastha main bharat ke akele padane kaa khatara nahin he, kyonki bharat ek aisi bada aarthik or raajnneetik takat he, jise koi duusari takat alag-thalag nahin kar sakati
 c Rajamohan, an expert on international affairs, writes in the Indian Express that India has an important geographical location, from where it can also play an important role in China's belt and road campaign and also create problems for it
 tippaniyan But India's real challenge is to prove its claims of territorial integrity even on the ground
 belt road muhim par bharat kii daleelon kaa ek or asar wo bataate hai
 He says that this has brought the issue of Jammu and Kashmir to the center in the context of India, Pakistan and China
 is mudde ko hameshaa bharat or pakistan ke bich dwipaksheeya mudde ke taur par hi dekha jaataa rahaa, lekin china hameshaa se isamen bhi ek bhoomika nibhaataa rahaa he
 Actually, the truth is that China is the third power in Kashmir
 ladakh ke ek bade ilaake par china kaa kabza he
 To its west, Pakistan has handed over a large part of its occupation to China after the 1962 indo-china conflict
 karakoram hive kashmir main china kaa pehla trans-border infrastructure project he jo saath ke dashak kaa he
 Since then, China's interference in the occupied Kashmir of Pakistan has increased
 china-pakistan aarthik galiyare ke pakistan ke kabze vaale kashmir ke saath judane se kashmir vivaad main china kii bhoomika or bad gai he
 It also formally began in Beijing on 14 May and 15 May
 iske udghaatan ke maukey par china samet 29 deshon ke rashtrapramukh or 70 anya deshon ke pratinidhi maujuud rahe
 One belt-one Road is the dream of Chinese President Xi Chinfing, whose aim is to improve China's contact and cooperation with Asian countries and also to connect Africa and Europe with Asian countries
 is project ke tahat zamin or samudri raaston se vyapaar margon ko behatar banaaya jayega
 There will be several highspeed rail networks, which will go as far as Europe
 asia or africa main kai bandargahon se ye root guzaregaa or iske raste main kai free trade zone aaenge
 China will bring 65 countries of the world closer to each other and directly connect two-thirds of the world's population to its economy
 arthshaastri ise us marshall plan kii tarj par dekh rahe hai, jisane duusare vishwa yuddh ke baad america ko duniya kii super power bana diya, lekin ye usase bhi bada project he
 If seen in terms of price, then according to today's price, the US Marshall Plan was $ 130 billion, while China's project is several times larger than that ie ten billion dollars
 shi chinafing ne ise project of da centuri bataaya he
 a plan that will fill the gap that has been created by Trump's dragging America back from the international economy under the policy of America First
 china iske zarie duniya kii arthvyavastha par apni pakad or gahari karne kii koshish main he
 At a time when domestic demand in China has decreased so much, to fulfill the growth appetite, it will have to move quickly to other countries and this project can prove to be very helpful for it
 china van belt-van road ke zarie apane saste or behatar utpaadon ko duniya ke bazaaron tak aasaani se pahunchaa paaegaa
 Its goal is to increase its trade by two and a half billion dollars in the next decade
 ek tarah se china apane aarthik samrajya ko aise badhaane ja rahaa he jaisaa pehle kabhi dekha yaa suna nahin gaya
 
 
 But for India, the most important thing is that India is not being a part of it
 
 
 dakshin asia main bharat or bhutan akele desh rah gaye hai jo isamen shaamil nahin hue
 China does not even have diplomatic relations with Bhutan, but why did India not join it? 
 
 bharat ne isaki vajah saafe kar di he
 He says that this project violates his sovereignty
 
 
 bhartiya videsh mantralay ne is mudde par bayaan jari kar kaha he ki koi bhi desh aise project ko sweekaar nahin kar saktaa jo samprabhutaa or kshetreey akhandta kii uski chintaaon ko nakaarta ho
 In fact, the One belt-one Road passes through the china-pakistan Economic Corridor, the sino-pakistan Economic Corridor, which falls in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 bharat ise apana hissaa maanata he or is ilaake main aarthik gatividhiyon main china ke shaamil hone par aitaraaz jataata rahaa he
 China has so far invested $ 46 billion to improve the infrastructure in the region, on which India has been consistently objecting
 sawaal ye he ki kya van belt-van road project se baahar hone se bharat ko nuksaan hoga
 
 
 Will India be isolated in the world economy? kai jaankaar maanate hai ki aisa nahin he
 There is no danger of India falling alone in the world economy, because India is such a large economic and political force, which no other power can isolate
 antarrashtriya maamalon ke jaankaar si rajamohan indian express main likhte hai ki bharat kaa ek ahm bhugolic sthaan he, jahaan se wo china ke belt or road muhim main ahm bhoomika bhi nibhaa saktaa he or uske liye dikkat bhi paidaa kar saktaa he
 The comments lekin bharat kii asli chunauti he kshetreey akhandta ke apane daavon ko zamin par bhi sabit karne kii
 He explains another effect of India's arguments on the Belt Road Campaign
 unka kahana he ki isse bharat, pakistan or china ke sandarbh main jammu-kashmir kaa mudda centre main aa gaya he
 This issue has always been seen as a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan, but China has always played a role in it as well
 darasal, sachai ye he ki china kashmir main teesri taaqat he
 China occupies a large area of ladakh
 uske pashchim main pakistan ne apane kabze kaa ek bada hissaa 1962 kii bharat-china ladaai ke baad china ke supurd kar diya he
 The Karakoram Highway is China's first trans-border infrastructure project in Kashmir dating back to the sixties

 China's role in the Kashmir dispute has increased further with the china-pakistan Economic Corridor joining Pakistan's occupied Kashmir

 bhartiya videsh mantralay ne is mudde par bayaan jari kar kaha he ki koi bhi desh aise project ko sweekaar nahin kar saktaa jo samprabhutaa or kshetreey akhandta kii uski chintaaon ko nakaarta ho
 In fact, the One belt-one Road passes through the china-pakistan Economic Corridor, the sino-pakistan Economic Corridor, which falls in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 bharat ise apana hissaa maanata he or is ilaake main aarthik gatividhiyon main china ke shaamil hone par aitaraaz jataata rahaa he
 China has so far invested $ 46 billion to improve the infrastructure in the region, on which India has been consistently objecting
 sawaal ye he ki kya van belt-van road project se baahar hone se bharat ko nuksaan hoga
 
 
 Will India be isolated in the world economy? kai jaankaar maanate hai ki aisa nahin he
 There is no danger of India falling alone in the world economy, because India is such a large economic and political force, which no other power can isolate
 antarrashtriya maamalon ke jaankaar si rajamohan indian express main likhte hai ki bharat kaa ek ahm bhugolic sthaan he, jahaan se wo china ke belt or road muhim main ahm bhoomika bhi nibhaa saktaa he or uske liye dikkat bhi paidaa kar saktaa he
 The comments lekin bharat kii asli chunauti he kshetreey akhandta ke apane daavon ko zamin par bhi sabit karne kii
 He explains another effect of India's arguments on the Belt Road Campaign
 unka kahana he ki isse bharat, pakistan or china ke sandarbh main jammu-kashmir kaa mudda centre main aa gaya he
 This issue has always been seen as a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan, but China has always played a role in it as well
 darasal, sachai ye he ki china kashmir main teesri taaqat he
 China occupies a large area of ladakh
 uske pashchim main pakistan ne apane kabze kaa ek bada hissaa 1962 kii bharat-china ladaai ke baad china ke supurd kar diya he
 The Karakoram Highway is China's first trans-border infrastructure project in Kashmir dating back to the sixties
 tab se hi pakistan ke kabze vaale kashmir main china kaa dakhal badhata gaya he
 China's role in the Kashmir dispute has increased further with the china-pakistan Economic Corridor joining Pakistan's occupied Kashmir

 India considers it its part and has expressed reservations over China's involvement in economic activities in the region
 is ilaake main buniyadi dhaanche ko behatar karne ke liye china ab tak 46 arab dollar kaa nivesh bhi kar chukaa he, jis par bharat lagaataar aitaraaz jataata rahaa he
 The question is whether India will suffer due to being out of One belt-one Road project
 
 
 kya bharat duniya kii arthvyavastha main alag-thalag pad jayega
 Many experts believe that this is not the case
 duniya kii arthvyavastha main bharat ke akele padane kaa khatara nahin he, kyonki bharat ek aisi bada aarthik or raajnneetik takat he, jise koi duusari takat alag-thalag nahin kar sakati

 is mudde ko hameshaa bharat or pakistan ke bich dwipaksheeya mudde ke taur par hi dekha jaataa rahaa, lekin china hameshaa se isamen bhi ek bhoomika nibhaataa rahaa he
 Actually, the truth is that China is the third power in Kashmir
 ladakh ke ek bade ilaake par china kaa kabza he
 To its west, Pakistan has handed over a large part of its occupation to China after the 1962 indo-china conflict
