 He is from Bihar and won Rs five crore in the fifth season of the game show aired on Sony TV
 haalanki yah itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 He felt the pressure of the question of five crores under immense stress
 ise susheel se behatar koun jaan saktaa he
 a wrong answer could have returned him empty-handed
 (neeche sawaal or us vakt kii puri detail pard sakate hai)game sho main amitabh bachchan ne jis vakt paanch karod kaa sawaal poocha tha, susheel ko peshaab bhi lagi hui thi
 He also mentioned this to Amitabh
 haalanki game puraa hone tak niyamon ke mutabiq use baahar jane kii anumati nahin thi
 This pressure of the question was not just Sushil, but his wife, relatives and many other people present on the show were also clearly visible
 kya tha vah sawaal ?amitabh ne paanch karod ke liye jo sawaal poocha tha vah game sho kaa 13waan or aakiri sawaal tha
 Sushil was in trouble
 baar-baar kursi par baithe unki bechaini saafe dikh rahi thi
 Actually, he had two lifelines of double dip and phone friend
 inke istemaal main paryaapt khatre bhi the
 There was a question of 5 crores - which colonial power came to an end with India after selling Nicobar Islands to the British on 16 October 1868? The four options for the answer were 1) Belgium 2) Italy 3) Denmark 4) France and a life line that went in vain
 Despite this, Sushil did not understand the correct answer to the question
 unhone phone of friend lifline istemaal kii
 For this, he spoke to Shyam Kishore Prasad in Motihari (bihar)
 phone line par amitabh ne shyaam kishor ke saath unka linep karaayaa
 Shyam Kishore had to hear and answer the question within just 30 seconds
 susheel ne jaldi-jaldi sawaal bataane kii koshish kii
 Unfortunately, he could not explain the question to Shyam Kishore in due time and his lifeline was ruined
 life line barbaad hone ke baad susheel ne kya kiya?aisa hone ke baad game sho main maujuud unke parijanon ke chehre utar gaye
 Whether or not Sushil would win five crores - became a subject of exciting interest from people on game shows and TV sets
 "italy aayaa nahin, france gaya nahin"teesri life line barbaad hone ke baad susheel ne khud sawaal kaa jawaab dene kaa prayaas kiya
 He muttered - "italy did not come, France went later
" baaki do main se koi ek jawaab he
 "during this, Amitabh advised him to leave the game show too, seeing the problem of Sushil
 aisa kar vah ek karod jitkar waapas ja saktaa tha
 However Sushil bubbled again
 "italy aayaa nahin
 Did not go to France
 to phir bache yahi donon
 "amitabh said to Sushil again," If you feel like this then you can play double dip
 "peshaab kii nahin mili anumatisushil ko peshaab janaa tha
 Amitabh did not allow him
 sawaal se pareshaan susheel kuch der chup baitha rahaa
 Amitabh advised her to focus
 vah behad dabaav mahasoos kar rahaa tha, usne amitabh se pani pine kii ijaajat lee
 Then got up and raised the glass
 pani pite hue vah lagaataar computor kii screen par sawaal doharaata rahaa
 However, he sat down on Amitabh's advice
 susheel ne phir sawaal dekh budbudana shuru kiya, "italy aayaa nahin, france gaya nahin
 "as he did this, the people present on the show started laughing and laughing
 haalanki susheel ke liye ye behad dabaav or pareshaani kaa vakt tha
 When Sushil, the last lifeline of usage, could not reach any answer regarding the question, he said to try the double dip
 yah uski chauthi or aakiri lifline thi
 During this, Amitabh tells him that he can not leave the game anymore
 ab use khelnaa hi padegaa
 In the double dip, Sushil told Denmark the first answer
 amitabh ne jawaab ko lock kiya
 Everyone there was at the peak of the adventure
 yahaan galati kaa matlab tha, paanch karod jeetne kii kagaar tak pahunchakar khaali haath lautnaa
 Did Sushil Kumar win the money? However, Sushil's answer came true
 jaise hi computor screen ninounsament kii susheel kumaar ne pani kii glasspane sir par udel diya
 He jumped with joy
 taaliyon ke shor main amitabh ne use bahon main bheench liya
 His wife also cried and clung to Amitabh for a long time

 Cover Story: Drought aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne buudhvaar ko dilli ke kashmiri get sthit antarraji bas adde (aiesabiti) par maharana pratap kii pratimaa kaa anaavaran to kiya, lekin iske liye bas adde par kii gai taiyaariyon ne kai sawaal khadey kar die
 During the program, drunken drums and speakers were misused, while the Government of India issued an order in October last year to ban noise pollution
 aadesh main likhaa gaya tha ki aiesabiti main dhwani pradooshan khataranaak stithi main pahunch gaya he or ise rokane ke liye turant thos kadam uthaane kii zarurat he
 But in contrast, a different picture was found in ISBT today
 jahaan ek taraf manish sisodiya, sanjay singh or kailash gahalot maharana pratap kii pratimaa ko maala pahana rahe the to dhol nagaade ke shor ne us dilli sarkaar ke dhwani pradooshan vaale aadesh kii awaz ko hi dabaa diya
 When asked about this by Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot, he said, "that order was for honking vehicles
 ab dhwani pradooshan ke dar se aadmi baatcheet to band nahin kar degaa
 "significantly, the Delhi Transport Department had taken a big decision regarding noise pollution in ISBT
 dilli ke aiesabiti bas adde par agar bas driver ne tej horn bajaayaa to unhen 500 rupee kaa jurmaana or iske alaava tej aawaaj main yatri ko bulaane par bhi 100 rupee kaa jurmaana bharne kaa aadesh jari hua tha
 How the leaders of the Hurriyat Conference in Kashmir are engaged in spreading violence in Kashmir with crores of rupees from Pakistan, till date and India Today has received strong reactions all around after its revelations
 yahaan tak ki kashmir samasya ko lekar hurriyat ko baatcheet main shaamil karne kii pairvi karne vaale netaa bhi is report ke baad sakate main hai
 The leaders of the left party have been strongly advocating that the government should take forward the dialogue on Kashmir and the Hurriyat Conference should be included in the talks along with all the parties there
 ajtak ke khulaase par kya boleen vrinda karaat?aaj tak or india today dwaara hurriyat netaaon ke sting baad is bare main puche jane par sipiem kii netaa vrinda karaat ne bhi kaha ki report main jo kuch dikhaaya ja rahaa he vah behad chaunkaane vaala aurkaphi gambhirmamla he
 He demanded that the government should immediately conduct an inquiry into the matter and whatever things are seen on camera are true, the government should take action against these people
 vrinda karaat ne kaha ki aaj tak or india today kii report ankhen kholane vaali he lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin he ki kashmir ke logon ke saath baatcheet kaa rasta band kar dena chahie
 He said that some Hurriyat leaders may be inciting violence with help from Pakistan and Hafiz Saeed, but closing the path of dialogue will not solve the Kashmir problem
 yahaan ham aapako bataate chalem ki aaj tak kii report main dikhaaya gaya ki kis tarah kashmir main hurriyat ke netaa khuleam yah kah rahe hai ki vah pakistan se saikadon karod rupye lekar kashmir ghati main hinsa failaa rahe hai or yahaan tak kii skool or aspataalon ko bhi jala rahe hai
 Hurriyat leaders are even saying that terrorist Hafiz Saeed also sends money to incite violence in Kashmir
 is video par pratikriya ke taur par vrinda karaat kahati hai ki ajtak ke report main jo dikhaaya gaya he use yah baat or bhi acchhee tarah se sabit hoti he ki kashmir ko lekar modi sarkaar kii nitiyaan buree tarah se vifal sabit hui he
 The result of that is that Pakistan is getting a chance to increase its influence in Kashmir
 vrinda karaat ne kaha ki left partiyaan lagaataar yah kahati rahi hai ki kashmir ke logon se baatcheet karne ke bajaay un par goliyaan barasaane se yaa unhen takat se kuchalane se hal nikaalane vaala nahin he
 Significantly, in the month of January, a team of 5 people, led by BJP leader and former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha, went to Kashmir and took initiative on their behalf to solve the Kashmir problem
 kashmir main kai daur kii yatra karne ke baad or hurriyat ke tamaam netaaon sahit duusari partiyon se baat karne ke baad yashavanth sinha or unke saath ke logon ne is baat kii joardaar pairvi kii thi ki kashmir par kisi bhi baatcheet menhurriyat ke netaaonko jarur shaamil kiya janaa chahie
 But after the Aaj Tak report, these people have stopped speaking and all of them, including Yashwant Sinha, refrained from talking on some excuse when asked about it and refused to answer Aaj Tak's questions

 In this regard, US President Donald Trump has also signed an executive order

 Following the Trump administration's order, all the assets of EDD and Shangfu will be locked in US jurisdiction
 saath hi america naagarik is company ke saath koi lenden nahin kar sakenge
 An American official told PTI, 'we want to state that there is a legislative standard in the US for transactions with a company
 america ne yah kadam isliye uthaaya he kyonki sieetise ke lagu hone ke baad disambar 2017 main china ne 10 sukhoi fiter vimaan, khaskar esayu-25es kii kharidari kii
 In addition, China purchased the S-400 missile system (also known as SA-21) and associated equipment in January this year
 'adhikari ne aage kaha, china ne rus se ye donon saude tab kiye jalmericacatsa lagu kar chukaa tha
 The missile system was signed between the Chinese company EDD and Rosbernecksport, a Russian arms exporter
 adhikari ne kaha ki china par is roak kaa ahm makasad rus par pratibandh lagaana tha
 The official said, "katsa has not been imposed to stop the defense capabilities of a country, but to prevent Russia's wrongful activities
 adhikari ne kaha, 'aisa pehali baar hua he, jab america ne katsa kii dhara 231 ke tahat karrwai kii he
 The official did not respond to the question that if Turkey has also bought the S-400 missile system, will the US take action against it as well
 adhikari ne kaha, duusare deshon kii kharidari par ab koi faisla nahin ho paaya he lekin hamane un deshon par gambhirtha se vichaar kiya he jinhone es-400 or sukhoi kii kharidari kii he yaa aage koi sauda karne kii manshaa rakhte hai
 The Trump administration has made it clear that countries under preparation to buy the S-400 missile system will be considered for action under KATSA

 At the same time, the court told the petitioner that in this PIL we do not see any public interest and the Supreme Court is already hearing this issue, so we do not want to hear this petition and are dismissing it
 tripal talaak ko lekardilli hoicortmen ek alag tarah kii yachika daakhil kii gai thi
 This petition was filed regarding the issue of Hindu girl marrying a Muslim boy
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki hindu ladki or muslim ladke ke bich nikaah hone ke baad muslim pati ko tripal talaak kaa haq na diya jaae
 Several serious reasons for this demand were also stated in the petition
 yachika main daawa kiya gaya ki hindu ladki jab kisi muslim se shaadi karti he to jo nikaahnamaa banaaya jaataa he wo urdu main hota he or ladki ko tripal talaak or muslim ladke ke bahuvivaah ke bare main jaankaree hi nahin di jaati he
 The petitioner also gave several examples in the petition and claimed that several Hindu girls approached him after performing an intercast marriage
 peedit ladakiyon kaa kahana he ki un par muslim ladakon se shaadi karke tripal talaak kaa khatra bana hua he or kai kaa talaak ho chukaa he jiske baad wo na to muslim pati ke ghar rah paa rahi he or na hi muslim se shaadi karne ke baad wo apane maayke laut paa rahi hai
 The petition pleaded that if the girl is a Hindu in the case of intercast marriage, triple talaq and polygamy of the Muslim husband should be justified
 saath hi intercast marij ke maamle main shaadi ke registration ko anivaary kiya jaae
 It has been said in the petition that women suffering from triple talaq have filed a petition in the Supreme Court, but there is only a case of Muslim women before the Supreme Court
 lihaaja hindu mahilaayein bhi tripal talaak se prabhavit hai
 No petition has been filed or heard yet about them

 " At the Golden Jubilee celebrations of the Press Council of India (PCI), Modi also referred to Mahatma Gandhi in support of his assertion that the media wants self-regulation

 It is the responsibility of PCI and other press related organizations to see what appropriate changes you can make over time

 Later, it was also reported that signals were received from the boat for several days after the blast
 'naav main aag laga do
 
 
 We do not want to serve them biryani, 'according to the news of the English newspaper' The Indian Express ', DIG Loshal said,' You will remember the night of 31 December
 
 
 main us din gandhinagar main tha or maine us raat aadesh dete hue kaha tha, naav main aag laga do
 
 
 We do not want to serve them biryani
 ' loshaal ne yah khulaasa surat main coast guard interceptor boat ICGS C-421 ke launch ke dauraan kiya
 Coast Guard DIG Sudhir Saini and Deputy Commandant g Sethi were present at the event
 diaiji loshaali chif of staff coast guard (north-west) kii jimmedaari nibhaate hai
 DIG denial, said newspaper report Falsecoast guard DIG BK Loshali, calling these reports false, saying that he had not given any orders to fly the boat
 loshaali kii ore se bayaan jari kar kaha gaya he ki akhbaar kii report tathyon par aadhaarit nahin he
 He said, 'during the program, i said that there is no need to feed Biryani to the anti-national elements, they should be prosecuted
 ' chitthee ke mutabik us oparation ko loshaali nahin balki coast guard commander (north-west) sambhaal rahe the
 We stand by our statement: In the Parrikarboat case, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar said that we stand by our earlier statement
 coast guard diaiji ne khabar kaa khandan kar diya he
 We will get it investigated and if something is found wrong, we will not miss action
 diaiji par anushaasanamak karrwai ke sanket bhi parrikar ne die
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the convocation ceremony of AIIMS on Monday
 is dauraan pradhanmantri halke mood main najar aae
 He suggested that children from poor sections should be called as special guests in such programs to encourage them
 iske alaava kya bole pradhanmantri, padhie unheen ke shabdon main:pradhanmantri modi kaa ames main sambodhanmain kabhi acha student nahin rahaa
 Nor was the award ever received
 isliye zyada baarikiyaan nahin pataa hai
 When the student gives the exam, the food also does not freeze
 bade tanaav main rahata he
 But today you have come across them, so why are you so serious? (applause) i have been watching since long
 kya kaaran he
 What is the reason, Mr
 Mishra? i would urge you to be more serious about your obligation
 lekin jivan ko gambhir mat bana dena
 (applause) Life is difficult
 sankaton se guzarate hue aage badhane kii aadat banaate chalanaa
 Its joy is different
 agar ham shastron kii taraf dekhen
 So in the Taittareya Upanishad, there was a guru-shishya tradition in Vedakal and there is a mention of how the disciple used to go to Convocation when he finished the Vidyarthi period
 vah parampara nae rang rup ke saath ab bhi chal rahi he
 i definitely have two suggestions
 kya kabhi ham is canvocation main ek special guest kii parampara shuru kar sakate hai
 There are schools in poor neighborhoods
 aise ek selected 8veen 9veen kaksha ke 30-40 bachche, unako yahaan bulaayaa jaae, baithaaya jaae
 And see what this world is
 jo kaam shaayad uskaa teacher nahin kar paaegaa
 This opportunity of an hour and a half in the mind of that child will create a curiosity
 man main sapane jagayegaa
 He will feel that sometimes this opportunity comes in my life
 kalpana kariye kitna bada asar ho saktaa he iskaa
 The thing is very small
 lekin takat bahut gahari he
 And these are the things that bring change
 or meraa aagrah he ki wo garib bachche
 If the doctor's child comes, he will say that my father also did
 samaaj jivan main apni saamaanya baton se kaise badlaav laa sakate hai
 Let us think on that
 jo doctor banakar aaj ja rahe hai
 You have achieved
 aaj aa ja rahe hai
 What is the difference between yesterday and tomorrow? aapane jab pehali baar ames main kadam rakhaa hoga
 Uncle must have given a lot of information at home
 aisa karnaa, aisa mat karnaa
 If you are sitting in a train, do not look outside the window
 ek prakaar se aaj bhi vahi pal he
 Convocation is a moment of counseling while taking the last step
 kabhi aap soche hai
 That when you were in the classroom, in the institute, you were studying, how protected were you, if any difficulty was encountered then a senior fellow would be found, if there was no solution, then the dean would be found if he was not found
 aapako ab tak surakshit maahaul main faisla karne kii naubat ai hogi
 But now one has to practice solitude like Eklavya
 lekin agar aap sochen ki band classroom se vishaal classroom main ja rahe hai
 Always be a student
 aap jin varisht janon ko maine sammanit kiya ve letest medical development se waakif honge
 Not because they see patients
 isliye kyonki unke andar kaa student jinda he
 If it would be thought that the completion of the studies of the institute would complete the student's life, then it would bring the stagnation
 jis pal siikhnaa band, us pal mrityu kii taraf pehla kadam pad jaataa he
 People were saying that it is surprising that Modi ji's energy
 bas itnaa jod lijie ki kuch nayaa behatar karne kii ichha aapako thakne nahin detii
 You often tell the patient that this should be eaten, it should not be eaten
 magar jaise hi mess main pahunche to spardhaa lagi hogi
 Let's see who handles so many special dishes today
 yahi to jindagi he doston
 Have you ever asked your soul
 marij ko to ye kaha tha or main ye kar rahaa hum
 All right in student life
 lekin ab nahin
 i am a cancer doctor and if i smoke cigarette smoke in the evening, what will be the difference? log aapkaa udhaaharan denge ki yaar doctor to khub cigarette peetaa he, ise pine se koi fark nahin padataa
 The life of a doctor can become the life of a patient, his inspiration
 sochakar dekhie
 There are fewer people who see life as such
 kya aapke professor achche the
 AIIMS building was good, you were a little hardworking, so today is the day
 agar aise sochaa to jindagi ko dekhne kaa drushtikon hamen purnataa kii ore nahin le jayega
 It would be cold while studying at night in exams
 neeche nikle honge
 The chaiwala will be sitting
 thandi raat main thilia ke neeche chaay vaala so rahaa hoga
 You must have told him, have to study overnight
 yaar chaay pilaa de
 He must have made tea by bringing milk from somewhere without making a mouth
 tab jaakar aapaki jindagi kii safalataa kaa aarambh hua hoga
 It must be getting late, the auto driver must have arrived in time
 kabhi kisi chaparasi ne ho saktaa he bataaya ho, nahin sahab syringe aise aasaani se lag sakati he
 How many people will have made your life
 ek prakaar se aap karj lekar aa rahe hai
 It was also right
 magar ab karj chukaane kii jimmedaari he aapaki
 Where did you get the facilities from? kisi gaanv vaale kii bas kaa bajet, kisi pichde ilaake ke skool kaa bajet yahaan diawart kiya hoga
 Someone else's right to you
 taaki doctoron ko best suvidhaayen milen
 It must have been mandatory
 kyonki desh ko aapaki jarurat he
 But you should also remember that society has given so much
 hameshaa yaad rahe ki mere saamne aae har vyakti ne kuch yogadan diya hoga, tab main yahaan tak pahunchaa hum
 He has authority over me
 main nahin jaanata jo yahaan se padhakar videsh chale gaye, un tak ye baat pahonchegi yaa nahin
 We do not want anyone to be backward
 kabhi ham bhi chuttee manaane jate hai saathiyon ke saath
 The patients are still there
 magar ye brake banataa he
 Sometimes there is a break that we doctor companions should go for five to six days in the jungles, backward villages and treat patients there
 unhen swasth jivan kii salaah den
 Earlier there was a Vaidyaraja in the village and the village was healthy
 aaj aankh kaa doctor alag he
 Ear is different
 wo din bhi dur nahin jab bai aankh vaala doctor ek hoga
 The right eye will be the second one
 lekin ab itane doctoron ke baad bhi logon ke swasth par sawalia nishaan lage rahete hai
 Technology is growing so much
 aap bataaie, robot hi oparation karegaa
 Programming will happen
 jo kaantanaa chhaantnaa he, kar degaa
 Later the para medical staff will continue to watch
 main aapako daraa nahin rahaa hum
 Change is coming at such a rapid pace
 puraane jamaane main rishiyon kii tasviir ke peeche ora hota tha
 We used to think that it would do for good designing
 magar aaj science kahati he ki aura medical science ke liye mahatvapurn ho saktaa he
 Aura Science is not yet fully connected to medical science
 magar scientist is par kaam kar rahe hai
 If it is accepted, revolution will come
 ham kranti se darate nahin hai
 But the worry should be whether we are matching with this or not
 kahin ham puraani pothiyon tak to nahin atake hai
 If this happens, change cannot come
 hamen relevent bane rahanaa hoga
 If you try for it, you can do a great service
 aap aise institution ke student hai, jisane hindustan main apana ek trade mark bana rakhaa he
 Today, if people want to build a good hospital anywhere in the country, what do people say
 are bhai hamaare yahaan ek ames bana do
 All they know is that if AIIMS becomes a thing then things get better
 sochie aap kitne bhagyavan hai
 The patient wants to be admitted here
 student chahta he ki yahaan admician mil jaae
 AIIMS has carved a niche for itself in the country and the world
 aap bahut bada saubhaahgya lekar ja rahe hai
 i hope that you will give everything as a child of Mother India to fulfill the dream of a healthy India
 sabko hrady se abhinandan
 i am your partner aapke kuch suzav honge to jarur mujhe bataaie
 We will try to go on a good path
 aapke bich aane kaa avasar mila
 i got to know why
 na acha peshant hum
 God never make me
 doctor to main hum hi nahin
 So called that i am PM
 desh kaa durbhaagya he ki ham log sab jagah chalate hai
 Anyway avasar mila
 i am grateful dhanyavad

 kodunglur yaa crangnore naamak is shahar kaa yah cheraman juma masjid bharat hi nahin, balki is upmahadweep kii sabase puraani masjid he, jo hazrat mohammad ke samay kii he
 It was built in 629 CE by Malik Ibn Dinar, an Arab evangelist
 is masjid se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki islam kaa desh main pravesh mughalon se bahut pehle ho chukaa tha
 Secondly it also shows that the Muslims had complete patronage of the local people, which can be seen even today
 kai gaiyr-muslim bhi is masjid main shraddha rakhte hai or apane bacchon kaa vidyarambh sanskaar karne is masjid main aate hai
 Other religious people prepare iftar during Ramadan here
 kehete hai ki cher vansh ke aakhri shaasha cheraman perumal ke sangrakshan main is masjid ko banaaya gaya tha

 One of these merchants was Malik Eban Dinar, who was allowed by the local satraps to build several mosques
 isliye masjid ko cheraman masjid kaha jaataa he
 Malik Eban Dinar was also a companion of the Prophet
 vah is masjid ke pehle gaji the
 He was followed by his nephew Habib bin Malik
 habib bin malik or unki patni ko isi masjid parisar main dafnaaya gaya he
 This mosque is a wonderful confluence of different religions
 kuch khaas kone se dekhne par yah ek mandir lagata he
 There is also a pond in the mosque on the lines of the temples of the south

 gujarat ke bhavnagar ke saarangpur main viraajane vaale kshtbhanjan hanuman yahaan maharajaadhiraj ke naam se raaj karte hai
 They sit on the throne of gold and fulfill every wish of their devotees
 kehete hai ki bajrang bali ke is dar par aakar bhakton kaa har dukh, unki har takalif kaa ilaaj ho jaataa he
 Then whether it is a bad eye or freedom from Saturn's wrath
 hanuman ne apane bal rup main hi suryadev ko nigal liya tha
 He slaughtered the demons and also became the soul of Lakshmana
 bajrang bali ne samay-samay par devataaon ko anek sankaton se nikaala
 Even today, Pawanputra takes the kashtha of devotees in this dham, hence he is called Kashthanjan Hanuman
 hanuman ke is is dar par aate hi har ksht dur ho jaataa he
 Every wish is fulfilled by coming here
 vishaal or bhavy kile kii tarah bane ek bhawan ke bichon-bich kshtbhanjan kaa atisundar or chamatkaari mandir he
 One of the magnificent temples of Kesarinandan is also the Kashthanjan Hanuman temple
 gujarat main ahmedabad se bhavnagar kii ore jate hue kareeb 175 kilometre kii duuri par kshtbhanjan hanuman kaa yah divya dham he
 Like a royal court, Hanuman sits on a beautiful throne made of 45 kg gold and 95 kg silver amidst the huge and magnificent mandap of this beautiful temple
 unke sheesh par heere jawaharaat kaa mukut he or paas hi ek sone kii gada bhi rakhi he
 An army of beloved apes is seen around Sankatmochan and his feet are Shanidevji Maharaj, which makes this form of Sankatmochan special
 bajrang bali ke is rup main bhakton kii atoot aasthaa he or ve yahaan dur-dur se khinche chale aate hai
 It is believed that such a grand and rare form of Pawanputra laden with gold ornaments is not seen anywhere else
 hanumat lalaa kii ye pratimaa atyant pracheen he, to is rup main anjaniputra kii shakti sabase niraali
 There is twice the Aarti Vidhansakshbhjhan This temple of Hanuman has twice the Aarti Vidhan, the first aarti is 5 in the morning
 30 baje hoti he
 Before the Aarti, the night adornment of Pawanaputra is taken off, then they are dressed in new clothes and decorated with gold ornaments, and after this, the Aarti of Hanuman Lala is performed between the recitation of Veda mantras and Hanuman Chalisa
 bajrang bali ke is mandir main vaise to rojaanaa hi bhakton kaa tantaa laga rahata he lekin mangalvaar or shanivaar ko yahaan lakhon bhakt aate hai
 Offer offerings of coconut, flowers and sweets and offer prayers to Kesarinandan
 kuch bhakt to maatr shani prakopon se mukti ke liye yahaan aate hai kyonki wo jaanate hai ki wo to shanidev se darate hai lekin shani dev agar kisi se darate hai to ve hai swayan sankatmochan hanuman
 Kannabhajan Hanuman is worshiped on Tuesdays and Saturdays
 bhakt apane kashton or buree najar ke dosha ko dur karne kii kaamana lekar yahaan aate hai or mandir ke pujari se bajrang bali kii puja karwaakar kashton se mukti pate hai
 What is special about this pilgrimage? This temple of Bajra Bali gives it a special place apart from their other temples
 The idol of Shani is seated at their feet
 kyonki yahaan shani bajrang bali ke charnon main stri rup main darshan dete hai
 That is why devotees who are troubled by Saturn's wrath come here and offer coconut and get rid of all worries
 aap jaananaa chaahate honge ki aakhir shanidev ko kyon lenaa padaa stri rup or wo kyon hai bajrang bali ke charnon main
 It is said that about 200 years ago, Lord Swami Narayan was doing satsang at this place
 swami bajrang bali kii bhakthi main itane leen ho gaye ki unhen hanuman ke us divya rup ke darshan hue jo is mandir ke nirmaan kii vajah bana
 Later Gopalananda Swamy, a devotee of Swami Narayan, established this beautiful statue here
 kaha jaataa he ki ek samay tha jab shanidev kaa puure rajya par aatank tha, log shanidev ke atyaachaar se trast the
 Eventually the devotees put their complaint in the court of Bajrang Bali
 bhakton kii baaten sunakar hanuman ji shanidev ko maarane ke liye unke peeche pad gaye
 Now Shanidev had the last option to save his life, so he took a female form
 kyonki unhen pataa tha ki hanuman ji bal brahmacharee hai or wo kisi stri par haath nahin uthaayenge
 As it happened, Pawanaputra refused to kill Shanidev
 lekin bhagwaan ram ne unhen aadesh diya, phir hanumanji ne stri swaroop shanidev ko apane pairon tale kuchal diya or bhakton ko shanidev ke atyaachaar se mukt kiya
 It is believed that this form of Bajrang Bali freed Saturn from the wrath
 isiliye yahaan kii gai puja se shani ke samast prakope tatkaal dur ho jate hai, tabhi to dur-dur se bhakt yahaan aate hai or shani kii dasha se mukti pate hai
 Because the devotees believe that this form of Kesarinandan contains the power of 33 deities
 is hanuman mandir ke prati logon main agaadh shraddha he
 Because here devotees get the blessings of Shani Dev along with Bajrang Bali
 kehete hai yahaan agar koi bhakt nariyal chadhaakar apni kaamana bol de to uski jholii kabhi khaali nahin rahati
 As soon as you get rid of Saturn's condition, you also get the protective shield of Sankatmochan

 tippaniyan He told that Vishwas Doshi (42), who is suffering from heart disease, was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the city for the last few days
 doctoron ne unki haalat kii satat nigaraanee ke baad unhen aath farvari kii shaam dimagi rup se mrit ghoshit kar diya
 Dubey said that after discussing with the family of Doshi, he was persuaded to donate his organs to give new life to the needy patients
 unhone bataaya ki doshi ke parijanon ne unki duusari kidney, donon ankhen or twachaa bhi daan karne kaa faisla kiya he
 These organs will be transplanted to needy patients admitted to local hospitals
 sambhag ayukta ne bataaya ki indore main pichley chaar maheenon ke dauraan paanch baar green coridor banaakar angadaan se mili angon ko gantavy tak pahunchaaya ja chukaa he
 The length of the first green corridor was 13 kilometers, through which the lever received from organ donation was 7
 5 minute main hawaii adde bheja gaya
 The lever was airlifted to a hospital in Delhi
 dube ne bataaya ki kareeb 10 kilometre lambe duusare green coridor ke jariye ek kidney ko saat minute ke bheetar shahar ke anya nijee aspataal pahunchaaya gaya
 The comments unhone bataaya ki dil kii beemaari se jujh rahe vishwaas doshi (42) kaa shahar ke ek nijee aspataal main pichley kuch din se ilaaj chal rahaa tha
 The doctors declared him mentally dead on the evening of February 8, after continuous monitoring of his condition

 Hitler inflicted death and ruin on Jews and other opponents, but he liked to take photographs with children and smiling young women
 uske prashansak maananaa chahenge ki usamen virali maanviya khubiyaan thim, use sangeet pasand tha
 Was it hypocrisy that his music collection also had Jewish musicians, even if he declared that there was no such thing as Jewish art! a follower of Stalin rebuked me for my criticism of his hero, that he was so sensitive that one could even hear the sound of grass growing! Criminals want to be remembered as academics and to be recorded in history as mass murderer art collectors! In this sense, evil can never be accomplished because it seeks the same humanity, irrespective of human qualities

 "it is in this light that we need to see the Bharatiya Janata Party's decision to take out the 'gandhi Sankalp Yatra', which marks his birth anniversary to propagate his ideas of" cleanliness, non-violence, Swadeshi, Swaraj and simplicity "
 Withdrawal from October 2
 gaur kiijie, is fehrist main sampradayik sadbhaav yaa hindu-muslim ekta nahin he, na hi yah jatigat bhedbhaav ke khilaaf ladgaye kii baat karti he, jo gandhi ke saamaajik or rajnatik kaarykram kii do mukhya baaten thim
 The hope of including the defense of the rights of minorities is in vain, which was a matter of deep faith for Gandhi in the early months of the formation of independent India
 taadaad main banisbatan kam muslim or isai samudaayon or yahaan tak ki gaiyr-hindustaniyon ko bhi barabari kaa rajnatik darja dene par jor dene kii vajah se hi aakhirkaar gandhi kii hatya hui
 People have expressed surprise over the aggressive move to adopt or capture Gandhi at the hands of the new BJP leadership
 kya party badal rahi he? swatchta abhiyaan ko apana dhwajvahak kaarykram banane kii laal kile se kii gai pradhanmantri kii ghoshnaa ne un logon ko bhi achraj main daal diya jo maananaa chaahate the ki musalamaanon ko gaaliyaan dekar or logon ko baantkar apana kariyar banane vaala netaa satta hasil karne ke baad rajaneta banane kii abhilaashaa kar rahaa he
 He advocated understanding them
 chah saal ne dikhaa diya ki gandhi kii yaadon kii sangat bhi bhaajapa kii raajnneeti ko nahin badal pai
 This is not the first time that the BJP and its mother organization RSS are playing Leela with Gandhi
 aresas ne gandhi ko apni praat: smaraniyon kii suchi main unki hatya ke baad hi shaamil kar liya tha
 This was necessary because he was seen as a participant in the violence that killed Gandhi
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ke maatahat bhaajapa ne 'gandhivadi samaajwaad' kaa naaraa apanaaya tha
 Later, she quietly set aside this milestone, but from time to time she kept coming back to Gandhi
 modi ke maatahat bhaajapa jis aakraamakata se gandhi ko hadapney kii koshish kar rahi he, vah nai jarur he, par is hukumat kii fitrat ke anuroop hi he
 No more mismatched pairs can be imagined
 donon main akeli saajha cheez hindu hona hi dikhaai detii he, jiske pratinidhitiv kaa aresas daawa karata he
 But it is not difficult to understand that his association with Hinduism is utilitarian, not a matter of faith
 na hi vah koi aadhyatmik dhong karata he
 It is an absolutely secular, worldly tool for gaining power and keeping it in your grasp
 aresas or bhaajapa ke liye hindu dharm ek janasankhyikee vichaar he, jo khud ko hindu maanane vaale logon kii bahusankhya ko lamaband karne main uski sahaayta karata he
 It was a very personal thing for Gandhi, not at all a thing used for political power
 aresas or bhaajapa ke liye ramayana, mahabharat or gita aitihaasik dastavej hai; gandhi ke liye ve kavy hai! aresas or uske sahyogi ram ke sateek janmasthan ko 'phir se hasil' karne ke liye masjid ko dhaha denge; gandhi ke liye ram aitihaasik shakhsiyat katai the hi nahin
 His clarity in these cases is shocking
 rajendra prasad ne jab unhen govadh par kanoonee pabandi lagane kii maang ke bare main bataaya, tab jawaab main unhone saaf manaa kar diya, kyonki bharat main aise bhi log hai jinke liye gomance khaanaa nishiddh nahin he
 For the RSS, India is primarily a land of Hindus
 musalamaanon or dusron ko is dharti par baad main aane vaale yaa bahari mana jaataa he, jinhen hindu rahan-sahan ke taur-tareeke sweekaar karne honge
 This was unacceptable for Gandhi
 unhone apane 'rachanaatmak kaarykram' main chaatro se kaha tha, ''aap dusron ko vande maataram gane yaa yahaan tak ki rashtriya dhvaj fahraane ke liye bhi katai majaboor nahin karenge
 So, Gandhi was everything the RSS was against
 phir aresas gandhi kii sangat par daawa karne kii koshish kyon karata he? meri raay main ek to yahi he ki vah donon ke bich samanta paidaa karnaa chahta he
 He wants to bring Gandhi down to his level by taking him down from a high pedestal in the Devakul of nation makers
 donon ke bich lagaav or prashansa ke bhav kaa daawa managasaint or khamakhyali he, magar ise aage badhanaa aresas ke liye jaruri he
 It helps his workers get rid of the inferiority gland — the inferiority gland from which they always suffer in front of Gandhi
 gandhi bhartiya janamanas main gahare paithe hue hai or unka kad chota karnaa jaruri he
 The BJP is also eager to make Gandhi its own because it wants to appear as a party defining the idea of india
 magar jaisaa ki ali khan mahamudabad likhte hai, ''is vichaar kaa strot aazaadee kii ladaai or samvidhan ke nirmaan main he
 The BJP has no ancestor or pedigree that can make its ownership of the idea credible, so it has become necessary to usurp Gandhi and the constitution maker Ambedkar
 or ladacupan ke liye bhagat singh ko bhi
 On the other hand, the campaign of condemnation against Gandhi continues unabated within
 yah aresas or bhaajapa ke dohare charitra ke bilkul anuroop he
 Despite the recent observance of 'main Bhi Godse' stickers on vehicles and Nathuram Godse being elevated, Sadhvi Pragya should not ignore the popular mandate
 yaa kya unke thik isi rukh kii vajah se unhen vot mila?alabatta yah sach he ki secular partiyon ne bhi gandhi ke vichaar, unke rajnatik aacharan kaa anukaran nahin kiya or unhen hamaare samuhik jivan main mahaj ek aanushthanik upasthiti main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 Our schools and public culture have also made Gandhi meaningless
 unhen lifestil guru, filgud maujuudagi bana diya gaya he—kuch aisa jo ve kadaapi nahin the
 He continued to challenge popular beliefs and forced people to rethink their attitude
 to bhi unhen aise sant main badal diya gaya jiske koi duniyavi sarokaar nahin the
 Our political strata had given political Gandhi long back
 ahimsak gandhi na keval british balki kai hamavatanon ke liye bhi dhamkee bhari maujuudagi the
 The non-violent Gandhi that is presented to us now is a non-disagreeable Gandhi who accepts all the violence of the state
 is dweshi bahusankhyakwaad ke shikanje se gandhi ko keval tabhi chhudaaya ja saktaa he jab unki raajnneeti ko phir se jinda kiya jaae
 It is a politics of disagreement, done with human courage, and which sometimes has to go against one's own people
 agar ham is raste par chalane ke liye taiyaar nahin hai, to bhaajapa or aresas ke haathon gandhi ke hadpe jane par vilaap karne kaa koi matlab nahin he

 After independence, the Congress has ruled these states, yet they have not been well

 So that BJP could not form government in the state

 donon ke bich achche rishte the
 But during this time, some objectionable pictures of the model were found from the boy's hand somewhere
 ladke ne un tasveeron ko model ke saamne rakhaa or use blackmel karne laga
 Instead of making those pictures viral, he used to get money from the girl
 phir achaanak wo ladki se shaareerik sambandh banane kii maang karne laga
 When the girl got upset, she met the SSP and on 16 October 2017, the cyber cell of Chandigarh Police was given the case for investigation
 sibar cell kaa incharge sab inspector naveen phogot tha
 He began investigating the case and arrested the accused youth
 saath hi uske kabje se model kii aapattijanak tasviren bhi baraamad kar leen
 After this, Khurafat started running in the vicious mind of SI Naveen
 usne model ko phone kiya or aaropee kii shinaakht karne ke bahaane ladki ko mumbai se chandigarh bula liya
 The model reached Chandigarh on her call
 wo industrial aria ke ek hotel main rukii thi

 Where he forcibly raped the girl
 ghatana ko anjaam dene ke baad usne ladki ko dhamkee dete hue kaha ki agar usne is bare main kisi ko bataaya to wo uski tasveeron ko soshal media main viral kar degaa
 The forced victim went back the next day after the incident
 usne is bare main kisi ko kuch nahin bataaya
 Two months ago, ie in August 2018, SI Naveen Phogat's name came to bribery in the bitcoin scam
 uski karatuuton ke chalate use fouran nilambit kar diya gaya
 At the same time, there was news of the suspension of SI Naveen to the model
 iske baad usne saahas jutaya or chandigarh police ke ek dspi ko aapbeetee sunai
 The police have immediately registered a rape case against SI Naveen Faugat on the model complaint

 Rahul Gandhi has said that Vosubramanian Swamy will take legal action
 unhone apane upar lagaae gaye aaropon ko bebuniyaad or niraadhaar bataaya
 Rahul said, the allegations leveled against me are baseless
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ye sabhi aarope jhuthe or apmanjanak hai or main iske khilaaf kanoonee karrwai karuunga
 'rahul said,' This is a complete violation of freedom of expression
 ye kanoon main di gai chhot kaa beja istemaal he
 He also said that he would use the law to answer Swamy
 gauratlab he ki subramanyam swami ne congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi or congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi par aarope madha he
 He has said that Kirahul has benami property worth crores
 subramanyam swami ne guuruuvaar ko hi dilli main ek press conference yojit kar kaha ki yang india naamak company main rahul, sonia gandhi ke 76 fisadi share hai
 Thus both of them have ownership over this company
 lekin rahul gandhi ne is company se sambandhit koi bhi jaankaree chunaav ayog ko nahin di
 After Subramanian Swamy's press conference, the opposition party BJP tightened its stance and said that whatever allegations have been leveled against Rahul Gandhi must be answered

 There has never been any importance of any third party in Rajasthan's electoral politics except Congress and BJP
 lekin is baar jis tarah se nirdaleey vidhayakahanuman beniwalki sabhaaon main bheed umad rahi he use dekh kar congress or bijepi donon hi partiyon main bechaini he
 Actually, Independent MLA Hanuman Beniwal has announced that on October 29, Jaipur will announce a third front by organizing an outrage rally
 jaipur ke maansarovar main hone vaali raily ke liye hanuman beniwalrajasthanbhar ke tabadatod daure kar rahe hai
 Huge crowds of Hanuman Beniwal are seen and heard in small gatherings

 Hanuman Beniwal has so far held big rallies in all major divisions of Rajasthan
 ab nai party kaa elaan kar tisare morche gathan karavidhansabha chunaavamein utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 For the third front, Beniwal is in talks with Deendayal Vahini of Ghanshyam Tiwari, BJP MLA from Bahujan Samaj Party and BJP
 mana jaataa he ki beniwal ke paas jat voton kaa bada aadhaar he jiske jariye congress or bijepi ke vot bank main send laga sakate hai

 ghanashyam tiwari ke saath brahman vot bank or bahujan samaaj party kaa anusuchit jati kaa vot bank saath aa jaataa he to kai siton par hanuman beniwal bijepi or congress donon kaa khel bigaad sakate hai
 It is believed that after Manvendra Singh joined the Congress in the area of barmer, BJP is eyeing the Jats but Beniwal has made a good grip there
 aise main agar beniwal ke ummidavaar vahaan khadey hote hai to bijepi ko nuksaan hoga
 While in the area of shekhawati, the Jats are once again associated with the Congress in large numbers
 shekhavati main BSP or beniwal ke gathbandhan se congress ko nuksaan!shekhavati main agar bahujan samaaj party or beniwal ke jat vot bank kaa gathbandhan hua congress ke liye bada nuksaan hoga
 However, it is also true that both BJP and Congress are accusing Hanuman Beniwal of having a meeting of BJP and Congress
 congress ke mahasachiv ashok gahalot kehete hai ki hanuman beniwal or ghanashyamatiwadidonon hi bijepi ke netaa rahe hai or chunaav ladate hai to bijepi ko hi nuksaan hoga

 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan or unke mantriyon ko din-raat or sote-jaagate sirf kashmir ke sapane aa rahe hai
 They are trying desperately to raise the Kashmir issue in front of the world again and again
 pakistan pehle bharat main aatankiyon kii ghuspaith karaata he or jab duniya ke saamne uskaa asli cheharaa ujagar ho jaataa he, to wo sharif banane kaa prayaas karata he
 However, this is not a new trick of Pakistan and the world is fully aware of this nefarious act
 ab pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ko hi dekh lijie, unhone bharat main aatankiyon ke ghuspaith kii khabar ko kashmir se jod diya he
 He says that in order to divert attention from Kashmir, the Indian media is reporting the infiltration of terrorists in India through Afghanistan
 pradhanmantri imran khan ne twit kar kaha ki bhartiya media main daawa kiya gaya ki kashmir main aatanki vaardaaton ko anjaam dene ke makasad se kuch aatankwaadi afghanistan ke raste bharat main daakhil ho gaye hai
 Apart from this, there are reports of some terrorists entering South India as well
 imran khan ne kaha ki kashmir masale se dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye aisi khabaren chalaai ja rahi hai
 It is clear that Imran Khan is not ready to accept the truth
 imran khan kaa twit dikhaata he ki pakistan ab tak kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane ke sadame se baahar nahin nikal paa rahaa he
 He is also completely bankrupt mentally
 pakistan kashmir masale par duniyabar se guhaar laga chukaa he, lekin koi bhi uskaa saath dene ko taiyaar nahin he
 Pakistan along with its friend China had taken the Kashmir case to the United Nations Security Council, but had to face it there too
 yahi vajah he ki pakistan ke hukmran bharat ko kabhi jang kii dhamkee dete hai, to kabhi jihad kii dhamkee dete hai
 However, none of his nefarious efforts are affecting India

 akram ne kaha ki 'raajnneeti or khel ko ek-duusare se alag rakhana chahie
 The match between India and Pakistan is more exciting than the Ashes series between England and Australia
 apane kariyar main 356 vanade maichon main 502 wicket lene vaale akram ne kaha ki ashes siries ko kareeb do karod log dekhte hai, lekin bharat or pakistan ke bich khele jane vaale kisi bhi match ko arab log dekhte hai

 co / jk3vsqe8sr mosul shahar main maare gaye 39 bharatiyon kii maut kareeb ek saal pehle hi ho gai thi or forencik report ke anusaar unamem se zyaadaatar logon ke sir main goli markar hatya kii gai thi
 The Iraqi forensic department carried out a forensic examination of the bodies of these Indians killed in the nemosul, according to which they were killed a year earlier
 sir main maari gai goliiraq ke swasthya mantralay ke tahat kaam karne vaale forencik medicine vibhaag ne inbharatiyonke shavon kaa diene test karaayaa
 These bodies were excavated by the Martyrs' Foundation from a hill in Badush near Mosul
 hindustan times ke anusaar, forencik medicine vibhaag ke pramukh doctor jaid ali abbaas ne bataaya ki maare gaye zyaadaatar logon kii maut sir main goli maare jane se hui thi
 Only the skeletons (bones) of these bodies are left
 isamen kisi bhi tarah mansapeshi yaa tissue nahin bache hai
 According to the forensic report, it can be said that these people died about a year ago
 isse pehle mangalvaar ko bhartiya videsh mantrisushamaa swaraj ne sansad main39 factory mazdooron kii maut kii jaankaree di thi
 During that time he had said that these people died between 6 months ago and 2 years
 unhone kaha ki 4 saal pehle agava hue 39 bhartiya ke shavon kii shinaakht iraq main diene ke aadhaar par kii gai he
 Mosul was in the possession of the terrorists, he said that during this time there was no search operation possible because Mosul was under the occupation of ISIS
 mosul 9 july ko aantkiyon se mukt hua or 10 july ko videsh rajya mantri general wike singh ko vahaan bhej diya gaya
 These bodies will be handed over to the Indian Embassy in Baghdad next week
 oktober main liya parijanon kaa diene39 bharatiyon main se ek manjinder kii bahan ne beete varsh oktober main is baat kii jaankaree di thi ki sarkaar kii ore se unke diene test kii baat kahi gai thi
 On October 21, 2017, Manjinder's sister Gurpinder told the news agency ANI that the DNA test of all of us has been asked, the reason was not given
 ham kaaphi nervas the
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the government had feared that all the 39 Indians had died in October itself
 isi kaaran unhone oktober se hi jaanch prakriya ko shuru kar diya tha
 The foreign minister gave information about the entire incident on Tuesday, but did not say when and how he died
 haalanki, unhone kaha ki in sabhi bharatiyon ko ISIS ne hi maaraa he
 The statements of family members also came after the statement of family member Sushma Swaraj
 kai parivaaravaalon kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii ore se unhen lagaataar kaha ja rahaa tha ki vah jinda hai

 hamen sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya tha ki ve jinda hai, ham sarkaar se kuch nahin chaahate
 Sushma had told in the House that the story of Harjit Christ was not true
 jo 39 shav mili hai, unamem se 38 ke diene match kar gaye hai or 39wein kii jaanch chal rahi he
 We had extracted the dead bodies after digging the mountain, General VK Singh went there and worked hard to find evidence
 unhone bataaya ki sabase pehle sandip naam ke shaks kaa diene match kiya gaya tha

 Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav has claimed that the upa's food bill has many flaws
 yah bill bhukhon ke liye nahin balki chunaav ke liye he
 Neither the poor nor the farmers will benefit from this bill
 unhone maang kii he ki centre sarkaar ko is bill par ek baar phir vichaar karnaa chahie or isamen rajyon ke mukhyamantriyon kii raay leni chahie
 During the discussion on food security bill in Lok Sabha, Mulayam Singh Yadav said that this bill has come
 ise sansad main pesh karne se pehle sabhi mukhyamantriyon kii raay leni chahie thi
 The state will bear the entire burden due to this bill
 bina mukhyamantriyon kii raay ke bagaiyr bill laana galat he
 Drawing a target line on the food bill, he said that he would support the law, but would not allow the bill to pass without amendment
 mulaayam singh ne kaha, 'garibi tay karne kaa aadhaar kya he
 The government has fixed the number of poor on the basis of 1997
 jabaki 16 saal main garib bade hai yaa ghate hai iskaa koi zikr nahin he
 Nor does the government say anything about it
 par jab bill lagu ha jayega to rajyon ke sabhi garibon ko sasta anaaj muhaiyaa karana pradesh sarkaar kii jimmedaari ho jaaegi
 This will increase the economic burden on the states
 kya centre iskaa anumaan lagaaya he ki wo dhan kahaan se aayega? kya centre sarkaar madad karegi? 26000 karod rupee kahaan se aaenge? kai rajyon kii haalat kharaab he
 You made the law and left the burden on the states
 'mulaayam singh yadav ne kaha, 'kisaanon kii fasal kharidne kii koi guarantee nahin he
 Every grain of the farmer will be purchased, where is the guarantee
 bichauliye badhenge
 But what will happen to the farmers
 yah bill kisaan virdohi he
 Amendments should be brought on it
 kisaanon kii kitni nunatam raashi milegi iskaa ullekh hona chahie
 Every state should get equal assistance
 kisi rajya ko zyada madad or kisi ko kam, yah bilkul galat he
 'mulayam Singh said,' Those who are extremely poor should get free food
 jab supreme court ne kaha tha tab garibon ko to diya nahin
 But the election bill arrived, then the food bill arrived
 pichhali baar manaregaa aayaa tha is baar food bill
 If hunger was concerned, why this bill did not come during the drought in Maharashtra
 ab jab chunaav najadik aayaa he to bill aa gaya he
 ' argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav par bihar vidhanmandal main vipaksh ke netaa susheel modi ne 90 lakh ke mitti ghotaale kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Modi alleges that the scam was perpetrated through Lalu Yadav's son Tej Pratap Yadav
 is aarope par lalu ne saaf taur par kaha he ki jo bhi jaanch ho karvaa lee jaae, jaanch se koi aapatti nahin he
 Lalu said to go to the zoo and investigate
 hamako paisa mila hoga to ricard main hoga
 On the contrary, we are giving cow dung of our cows to the zoo for free
 bijepi netaa susheel modi ne mangalvaar ko apane sanvadata sammelan main lalu par aarope lagaate hue is sambandh main dastavej bhi pesh kiye the
 Actually, a shopping mall is being built near Saguna Mor in Patna
 susheel modi ke mutabik- jameen ke maalik jis dilite marketing company privet limited se hai, uske teen diarectaron main lalu yadav ke donon bete tejpratap or tejasvi ke saath beti chanda yadav bhi hai
 The owner of the company to whom the construction work has been given on this land is also Abu Dosna, an MLA of the Rashtriya Janata Dal
 is mal main underground do level kii parking he or usase nikali mitti ko patna chidyaghar main lagaaya gaya
 The work of clay in Patna Zoo amounted to about 90 lakhs, but could not provide any evidence that the soil which came in the zoo was the soil from the mall under construction
 vaise patna chidyaghar van vibhaag ke tahat aata he or van mantri tejpratap yadav hai
 The Forest Department says that 95 at the zoo
 75 lakh rupee kii laagat se ek sadak kaa nirmaan kiya ja rahaa he jisamen mitti kaatane or uske parivahan or analoding ke liye 44
 There is a provision of 92 lakh rupees
 pichley kai maheene se kaam chal rahaa tha or ab puraa ho chukaa he
 But the department has not yet given any concrete answer as to why no tender was floated for this work
 patna chidyaghar ke nideshak ne pushti kii he ki unhone yah kaam bina kisi tender ke diya, lekin uske liye unka daawa he ki yah karne ke liye vibhaag sakasham he
 The comments susheel modi ne daawa kiya ki chunki lalu yadav ko mitti ko khapaana tha isliye patna chidyaghar ne bina tender ke ye kaam virender yadav ko diya, jo lalu yadav ke kareebi rahe hai
 Now Sushil Modi has demanded Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to investigate the entire matter and simultaneously sacked Tej Pratap Yadav
 lekin is puure maamle ne susheel modi kii maane to kai sawaal khadey kiye hai ki kya koi nideshak 90 lakh kaa kaam bina tender ke kar saktaa he
 On the other hand, why were the contracts given to people close to Lalu Yadav
 haalanki susheel modi ke in aaropon par jab vanmantri tejpratap yadav se sampark karne kii koshish kii to unase sampark nahin ho paaya
 BJP leader Sushil Modi, in his communicators' conference on Tuesday, had also produced documents in this regard, accusing Lalu

 Through these two rallies of the PM, BJP has formulated a strategy to feed lotus on the 13 Legislative Assembly of the first phase

 While the second election rally will be held at 1:20 pm at the Phuggu Pakka Airport Ground in Gumla
 in donon siton par adivasee samudaay hi jeet-haar tay karte hai
 The political equation of Daltonganj, Daltonganj assembly seat comes under Palamu district
 angrej kamishnar karnal daalaton ke naam par yahaan kaa naam dalatonganj padaa
 Daltanganjshahar, situated on the banks of the Koyal river, is later changed from Daltonganj to Medininagar, named after the Chero king Medni Rai
 piem modi bijepi pratyaashee alok chaurasia ke paksh main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karenge
 Alok Chaurasia was elected MLA from JVM in 2014 and later joined BJP
 bijepi ko takkar dene ke liye gathbandhan ne chunavi maidan main purv mantri va congress netaa krishnanand treepathi urf keen treepathi ko maidan main utaara he
 KN Tripathi is confident that he will get the JMM and Congress traditional votes and will win on this basis
 haalanki, dalatonganj seat par 32 saal ke alok chaurasia kaa kabja he
 In such a situation, this seat is considered very important for the BJP
 yahi vajah he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi jharkhand main apni pehali jansabha dalatonganj kshetra se shuru kar rahe hai
 Gumla seat equations Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address his second rally in favor of BJP candidate Misir Kujru on Gumlasit, safe for tribal community
 pichley do chunaav se is seat par bijepi kaa kabja he or har party yahaan se jite hue vidhayak kaa tikat katkar nae chehre par daanv khelti rahi he
 This time also BJP has replaced Misir Kujru in place of sitting MLA Shivshankar Oraon

 The Gumla Assembly seat of Jharkhand is reserved for the Scheduled Tribes
 is seat par uraanv jati ke vidhayakon kaa dabadabaa rahaa
 Maximum number of mlas were elected from BJP six times, while three Congress and two JMM mlas have been elected from here
 saal 2004 main jeemem ke bhushan tirki vidhayak chune gaye the
 Whereas bjp's Kamlesh Oraon won here in 2009, but in 2014 the party played bets on Shivshankar Oraon instead of him and he won and became an MLA
 bijepi ne is baar uraanv kii jagah misir kujaru par daanv khelaa hai
 In such a situation, PM Modi will be able to rally in Gumla to decide the victory of Miss Kujru? bihar ke logon ke saath maharashtra or gujarat main ho rahi marpet ko lekar ababijepike netaa hi aamane saamne khadey dikh rahe hai
 In Mumbai, bjp's Bihar cell chairman Fool Singh has announced that he will not allow the Union ministers of Bihar and UP to enter Mumbai
 phool singh kii naaraazgi viley parley ke bijepi vidhayakaparag aluvaniko lekar he
 They allege that the mlas are beating the rickshaw drivers of Bihar and UP in their area with sticks at night and all are silent
 phool singh kaa aarope he ki bihar or upi se aane vaale kendriya mantri bhi is par kuch nahin bol rahe hai
 a video of Phool Singh is becoming increasingly viral, in which he has said that 'our own party MLA Parag Aluwani is the MLA of Vile Parle
 unke hi kshetra ke gujarat colony main pichley 25 saal se uttar bhartiya garib rickshaw vaale log rahete hai
 These people run their rickshaws throughout the day to support their families and some policemen and their goons beat rickshaws ruthlessly every night at the behest of Parag Aluvani
 main to daawey ke saath kahata hum ki paraag aluvani kaa sambandh alpesh thakur jaise logon ke saath he
 'the video further states,' i am an ordinary Indian citizen and i cannot tolerate these things
 uttar pradesh or bihar ke netaaon ko meri yah chetavanee he ki is par roak nahin lagi to main mumbai main ghusane nahin duungaa
 Phool Singh in his video targeted the Union Minister Giriraj Singh and said, 'I also urge the venerable Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rein in such leaders
 giriraaj singh maharashtra main ghatana ghategi to nahin bolenge, gujarat main ghatana hogi to nahin bolenge

 dilli kii ek adaalat ne sibiai ko shuukravaar ko nirdesh diya ki viviipi helicopter ghotaale main vayusena ke purv pramukh or sah aaropee espi tyaagi ke khilaaf jari lukout circular ko vah nirast kar de
 Special Judge Arvind Kumar asked the investigating agency to inform the authorities concerned in this regard
 sibiai ne ek sitambar 2017 ko maamle main aarope patr daayar kiya tha jisamen tyaagi or britain ke naagarik chrishchiyan mishael kaa naam aropiyon ke rup main shaamil kiya tha
 In the charge sheet filed in connection with the bribery in the VVIP chopper deal, the names of the other nine people were also included
 tyaagi (73) bhartiya vayusena ke aise pehle pramukh hai, jinka naam sibiai ne bhrashtachar yaa aapraadhik maamle main aarope patr main shaamil kiya he
 However, Tyagi has denied all the allegations
 petrol ke daamon ko lekar bhadki aag par upi or dilli sarkaar pani daalane kii koshish main he
 Both Akhilesh Sarkar and Sheila Dixit have indicated to reduce VAT on petrol
 petrol kii aag jab dilli se lekar lakhanu tak bhadki, to rajya sarkarein hill gayi
 Even though oil companies have set fire to the prices of petrol, the anger of the public is on the state governments, hence UP and Delhi are now considering reducing VAT
 mulaayam singh yadav ke raaj main uttar pradesh main waite lagu nahin tha, lekin mayawati sarkaar ne upi main petrol par 26 fisadi se zyada waite laga diya
 Due to this, now the price of petrol in UP has been more than 75 rupees
 yahi vajah he ki petrol ke daam badhane ke baad phir se samaajawaadee party kii sarkaar waite kam karne yaa waite hataane par vichaar kar rahi he
 Similar signs have been given by the Sheikh government of Delhi, like Akhilesh government of UP
 dilli main abhi petrol par 20 fisadi waite lagu he, jiske chalate is vakt dilli main petrol kii keemat 73 rupee se zyada ho gai he
 Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit, who arrived in Jammu, has indicated signs of VAT reduction

 lekin khan ne spasht kiya ki pisibi bharat main khel sambandhon kaa bahishkaar karne ke liye piechaef ke padchinhon par nahin chalegaa
 The comments khan ne shuru main isisi pratispardhaon main bharat kaa bahishkaar karne kii dhamkee di thi

 He said that Kanhaiya Kumar's candidature from Begusarai was hampered between the alliance between the two parties
 aisa isliye bhi kyonki rajd ko kanhaiya se jude kai vivaadon ke chalate unke chunaav jeetne kii kshamta par andeh tha
 Manoj Jha said that there could not be an alliance between the CPI-RJD as the RJD was not willing to compromise on the popularity of its candidate Tanvir Hasan in Begusarai and the work done by him
 unhone kaha ki rajd bahut majboot takat rahi he
 Even in the so-called Modi wave in the 2014 elections, our candidate got nearly four lakh votes and since then he never left Begusarai
 tanwir hasan kii ummidavaari ko najrandaaj karnaa hamaare liye asambhav tha
 Our cadre is strong who wanted Tanveer Hasan
 aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo ham nahin kar sakate
 Everything depends on our workers, people
 isliye, unki jagah kisi or ko ummidavaar bananaa gathbandhan na hone kii vajah bana
 Hassan finished second in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, losing to bjp's Bhola Singh by a margin of around 55,000 votes

 It was third with 92 lakh votes
 gauratlab he ki bhakpa kii bihar ikai ke sutron ke anusaar party netaaon ke ek varg main kanhaiya kumaar ko namit karne or gathbandhan par samjhauta karne ko lekar asantosh tha
 Kanhaiya, who was close to Kanhaiya at the time of the sedition case but later involved in the establishment of rjd's student union in JNU, said that it was "the cause of Kanhaiya Kumar's arrogance and ignorance that was not aligned
" haalanki kanhaiya ne phone par baar-baar sampark kiye jane ke baad bhi gathbandhan nahin ko lekar koi tippanee nahin kii
 Significantly, after not making Kanhaiya Kumar its candidate from RJD, CPI has made him its candidate
 unke khilaaf bijepi ne kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ko maidan main utaara he
 While RJD has named Tanveer Hasan as its candidate

 There is no doubt that the spinners in Visakhapatnam will hold silver
 bharat or england ke bich doosraa test yahaan khelaa janaa he, lekin rajkot main england ke spinners ne bharat ke 16 main se 13 wicket apane naam kiye
 In such a situation, the challenge of Visakhapatnam for the spinners of Team India and the batsmen of Team India does not seem easy
 test maichon main england ke liye sabase zyaada shatak lagane vaale captain elister cook kehete hai, 'hamane jaisaa rajkot main khel dikhaaya he agar vaise hi khelte hai to ham bhartiya ballebaazon par kyon nahin dabaav bana sakate?
 We also have seamers and with six bowlers in the team we have many options
 ' cook ye bhi kehete hai ki ve yahaan team india ko har pahalu main acchhee chunauti dene vaale hai
 Visakhapatnam's pitch will not have grass like Rajkot, it is believed to be fixed
 team india ke captain viraat kohli kehete hai, 'main yahaan aisi pich kii ummid kar rahaa hum jahaan (newzealand ke kilaaf pichley maheene) vanade main spinners ko wicket mili the or shuruyaat main tej gendbaazon ko madad mili thi
 It was surprising to see the grass on the pitch of Rajkot
 ummid karata hum ki yahaan aisa nahin hoga
 Because on home grounds we want to pressurize the opposition team by playing according to our strength
 ' After the Rajkot Test, both Team India and England have come to Visakhapatnam with the hope that they will surely get a turning track here
 captain viraat kohli, mehmaan team ke captain elister cook or pich curator ashish bhaumik ne pich ko lekar itane ishaare kiye hai ki vishakhapatanam kii pich ke mizaaj ko samaj paanaa koi bahut badi chunauti nahin ho sakati
 There is also scope for changes in Team India in Visakhapatnam
 gautam gambhir kii jagah karnataka ke liye ranjai main shatak lagane vaale keel rahul kaa team main shaamil hona qareeb-qareeb tay mana ja rahaa he
 It is possible that the bowling line-up has also changed slightly
 viraat kohli kah chuke hai ki keel rahul,murali vijay ke saath team management kii pehali pasand hai
 The comments team india kii badi mushkil team main badlaav yaa pich ke mizaaj kii nahin
 How do Indian spinners perform against England and how do Indian batsmen face the best of England spinners
 viraat kohli kehete hai, 'hamane rajkot main jo bhi siikhaa uskaa istemaal ham agle 10-12 saal kar sakenge
 We see him as a cricketer
 mere saath team ke 2-3 or logon ne rajkot main khud ko applai kiya

 ' The claims of captain Virat Kohli suggest that with the lessons his team has gained in Rajkot, they can start a win in Visakhapatnam

 rajkot kii tarah vishakhapatanam kii pich par ghaas nahin hogi, yah tay mana ja rahaa he
 Team India captain Virat Kohli says, "I am looking forward to a pitch where (against New Zealand last month) the wickets got to the spinners in odis and the fast bowlers got help in the beginning
 rajkot kii pich par ghaas dekhakar hairaani hui thi
 i hope that will not happen here
 kyonki gharelu maidaanon par ham apni taaqat ke mutabik khel kar vipakshi team par dabaav daalana chaahate hai
 ' rajkot test ke baad team india or england, donon timen vishakhapatanam is ummid se ai hai ki yahaan yakeenan unhen ek terning trek milegaa
 Captain Virat Kohli, the visiting team captain Alastair Cook and pitch curator Ashish Bhowmick have made so many gestures about the pitch that it cannot be a big challenge to understand the mood of the Visakhapatnam pitch
 vishakhapatanam main team india main badlaavon kii bhi gunjaaish dikhti he
 KL Rahul, who scored a century in Ranji for Karnataka in place of Gautam Gambhir, is considered almost certain to join the team
 mumkin he ki gendbaazi line ap bhi thodi badali hui nazar aae
 Virat Kohli has said that KL Rahul is the first choice of team management along with Murali Vijay
 tippaniyan Team India's biggest problem is not the change in the team or the mood of the pitch
 bhartiya spinners england ke kilaaf kaisaa pradarshan karte hai or bhartiya ballebaaz england ke umdaa nazar aa rahe spinners kaa kaise saamana karte hai
 Virat Kohli says, 'we will be able to use what we learned in Rajkot for the next 10-12 years
 bataur cricketer ham use aise dekhte hai
 Along with me 2-3 more people from the team applied themselves to Rajkot
 hamen mazaa aayaa or us sikh kaa istemaal aage bhi hoga

 'modi lahar' ke sahare hi bijepi bahumat ke saath desh kii satta main vaapasi kar pai or phir ek ke baad ek rajyon main vijay pataakaa fahraati ja rahi he
 Not only in the country but also abroad, the name of Modi is being stung and Narendra Modi has emerged as a big brand
 is brands kii badaulat hi bijepi ne desh ke 70 fisadi hisse main bhagava rang chadha diya he
 BJP government in 20 states After winning the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the pair of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah won one state after another
 bijepi kaa raajnneetik aadhaar lagaataar failata ja rahaa he
 At present, BJP has government in 20 states of the country
 maharashtra, haryana, jharkhand, jammu-kashmir, assam, uttar pradesh, uttarakhand, manipur, goa, gujarat, himachal, tripura, nagaland, meghalaya, bihar, madhyapradesh, arunachal pradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, sikkim main bijepi satta main he
 Many of these states have a BJP government and in many places the party is a partner in power in collaboration with allies
 iske alaava bijepi ne duniya kii sabase badi party banane kaa record bhi apane naam kar liya he
 BJP has been descending and winning in the election season on Modi's name and work
 2014 ke baad ke chunaavon main modi sarkaar ke dauraan hui sargical strike, notebandi, ujjwala yojana, jandhan, jiesti, vidyutikaran party ke chunavi mudde ban gaye
 From BJP posters, pamphlets, cats to hoardings and social media, Modi was the only one
 dilli, bihar or punjab kii haar ko chhod den to baaki sabhi rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main yaa to bijepi ko satta mili yaa phir vah sammanjanak sthiti main rahi
 Modi vs the entire Opposition The way the opposition was united against the Congress in a period of politics
 usee tarj par modi ke khilaaf bhi congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi sahit tamaam netaa vipaksh ko ekajute karne kii koshish main lage hai
 Modi's stature can be gauged from this
 isse pehle indira gandhi ke khilaaf vipaksh main aisi ekajutata dekhi gai thi
 The voice of solidarity in the opposition was further heightened after the results of the recent Karnataka Assembly elections
 isse lagata he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main muqabla modi banaam puraa vipaksh hoga
 That is, the biggest election issue of 2019 is going to be Modi himself
 modi ke naare hit, nayaa trade kiya setpradhanmantri narendra modi ke shabdon kaa jaadu logon ke sir par chadhakar bolta he
 Things like 'sabka saath sabka vikas', 'this time Modi government', the nation's watchman, neither khaunga nor khoona lenga will remain on the tongue of Modi supporters
 modi ne soshal ejineering kaa nayaa formula set kiya he
 They brought together different ethnic groups and gave them a stake in everything from party to government
 haryana main gaiyr jat, maharashtra main gaiyr marathi or jharkhand main gaiyr adivasee ko siem bananaa modi kii raajnneetik sooyeeboojh or duuradrushti kaa udhaaharan he
 Modi's convincing politicians of many countries, the growing popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made an impact in the last four years of India's border crossings abroad and his image has gained world recognition
 modi ne apane chaar saal ke shasankaal main may 2018 tak 36 videshi dauron main 54 deshon kii yatraaen kii hai
 'modi-modi' slogans are raised on foreign soil
 pichley chaar saalon main modi paanch baar america kaa daura kar chuke hai
 a total of 7 countries had come to attend Modi's swearing-in ceremony, including Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 iske alaava videshi mehmaan bharat daure par aa chuke hai jinamein america, china, rus,japan, australia, south africa, srilanka, bangladesh or britain jaise pramukh desh ke rajaneta shaamil hai

 com / jzf8szdaia centre main modi sarkaar ko bane abhi ek saal puraa nahin hua he or sarkaar apana doosraa relbajatpesh karne vaali he
 This time it will be the first full railway budget of the Modi government
 lekin sutron kii maane to ho saktaa he yah sarkaar dwaara pesh kiya jane vaala aakhrirel bajtbhi ho
 Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government will run for a full five years, they have an absolute majority
 lekin ho saktaa he agali baar se sansad main rail bajet pesh hi naa ho
 Hindi newspaper Dainik Bhaskar has quoted sources as saying that from next year, the Union Government will present the budget of the Railway Ministry only under the general budget
 rail mantralay se zyada bajet vaale bhi kai duusare mantralay hai, aise main sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki sirf rail mantralay kaa hi bajet alag kyon bane
 The government has also formed a committee under the chairmanship of Niti Aayog member Vivek Debroy to restructure the six-member Railway Board, the most powerful organization of the Railway Ministry
 rail mantralay kii ginati centre sarkaar ke un gine-chune mantralayon main he jo phayda kama rahi hai
 In the Rail Budget, which is going to be presented on Thursday 26 February, the central government's main emphasis will be on raising money
 haalanki rail mantralay ne kiraaya nahin badhaane kaa aashwaasan diya he, iske baavjood sabhi shrenee ke yatri kiraayon main is baar maamuli vruddhi kii ghoshnaa kii ja sakati he
 Railways will focus on raising more funds by better utilization of land, buildings and other resources along with freight
 rail mantralay ko abhi sirf yatri kiraaye se hi 45 hajaar karod rupee kii aamadani hoti hai
 95% of this comes from General Category or Three Tier Sleeper
 asi thri tear ko chhodkar railway ko sabhi shreniyon ke kiraaye main nuksaan uthaanaa pad rahaa he
 AC three-tier seats are filled within five-six hours of the opening of the train booking
 inamen 24 se 28 dibbe tak lagane kii ghoshnaa bhi ho sakati he
 Most of these coaches will be AC three tier only
 asi chairkaar main premium siton ke liye zyada kiraaye kii ghoshnaa bhi sambhavit he
 Railways are earning 90 thousand crore rupees from freight
 rail se maal dhulaai trek ke mukaable ab bhi teen guna sasti he
 Despite this, he has a profit of only 45 thousand crores in this item
 yani ab un par or train chalaae jane kii gunjaaish nahin he
 The major hurdle in laying new train lines is land acquisition, which is not possible at all without the help of state governments
 rail mantralay nae trek bichaane ke liye rajya sarkaron ke saath special parpus vehical (espivi) banaaegi, jisamen donon kii hissedari rahegi
 For this, all states except Uttar Pradesh agree

 Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia's single bench has fixed the matter for hearing on 30 September
 harish ravat par vidhayakon ke kharid farokht kaa aarope he
 Earlier on September 20, the CBI had submitted the status report of its preliminary inquiry into the sealed cover against the Harish Rawat to the Nainital High Court
 vahiin maamle kii sunwaayee kar rahi nainital hai court ne maamle ko alag peeth ke paas bhej diya tha
 It may be known that in 2016, the sting of the horse-trading case by the then Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Harish Rawat came to light
 iske baad uttarakhand main congress sarkaar giri or sarkaar girane ke baad rajyapal kii sanstuti se harish ravat ke khilaaf sibiai ne jaanch shuru kii thi
 The CBI had recently filed a modification application in the Nainital High Court in the mla-horse-trading case, stating that the cbi's preliminary inquiry into the matter has been completed
 ab is maamle main harish ravat kii giraftaar karnaa chaahati he
 The High Court has accepted the application of the CBI, after which it became clear that the arrest of Rawat can be done anytime
 bahubali 2 ke baad prabhas kii agali film kii charchaa shuru ho gai he
 This film is Saaho and Prabhas's first look in the film has also gone viral
 prabhas apane is new luk main kaaphi hot lag rahen he or saath main unkikute si smil bhi kaaphi atractakar rahi he
 However, there are some speculations that it could be the look of Prabhas' new film or a photoshoot
 ab chaahe ye koi film kaa luk ho yaa koi photoshute, lekin prabhas isamen kaaphi achche lag rahe hai or tasviir viral bhi ho gai he
 Recently, Prabhas had said in an interview that apart from Saho, he could soon see a film which will be based on the love story of Russia
 unhone is intervyuu main ye bhi kaha tha ki philhal wo chhuttiyon se lautne ke baad se apni agali film kii shooting main jute chuke hai
 Baahubali's success was out of line with the success of the film Baahubali 2, much to the excitement of his business as his team had thought of earning 250-300 crores but in reality the figure was quite shocking

 sanjay lila bhansaali kii film 'padmavati' kii shooting shuru bhi nahin hui he ki iskaa virodh shuru ho gaya he
 In the film, Deepika Padukone is playing the role of Rani Padmini (padmavati), the wife of King Ratansen of Chittor
 film mendipikake pati kii bhoomika main shahid kapur najar aaenge
 At the same time, Ranveer Singh has been signed for the role of Alauddin Khilji
 is film kaa virodh gujarat main hardik patel kii aguai vaali patidaar navnirmaan sena kar rahi he
 At the same time, Rajput Karni Sena in Rajasthan is strongly against this film
 hardik patel ne film ke nirdeshkasanjay lila bhansaliko chitthee likhakar chetaya he ki film main tathyon se khilwaad kisi surat main nahin bardaasht kiya jayega
 Hardik Patel said that unless Bhansali gives an assurance in writing, the shooting of this film will not be allowed in Gujarat
 vahiin rajput karani sena bhi rajasthan main film kii shooting nahin hone dene ke liye adi he
 Karni Sena has spoken to Hardik Patel on this issue
 hardik nebhansaliko likhi chitthee main kaha he ki film ko aitihaasik tathyon se todmarod kar relies kiya gaya to karodon logon kii bhaawanaaon ko thes pahonchegi, aise main kanoon or vyavastha kii samasya saamne aa sakati he
 According to Hardik, if this film is made with the wrong facts, then it will not be allowed to run in the cinema hall of the country
 hardik ne kaha ki rani padmini kaa naam rajasthan ke itihaas main bahut aadar ke saath liya jaataa he
 He sacrificed his life in 1600 for the self-esteem of Chittor by jumping into a burning pool with queens
 aisa unhone allaudin khilji ke chittorgarh par hamale ke dauraan kiya tha
 According to Hardik, he was told by members of the Rajput Karni Sena that Bhansali did not read the history of the film properly, so there is a possibility of damaging the image of Rani Padmini
 hardik ne bataaya ki unhone bhansaali se film kaa production band kar pehle rajput netaaon se baat karne ke liye kaha he
 According to Hardik, no filmmaker has the right to damage history in the name of entertainment
 hardik ne kaha ki wo pichley kai arse se mewar main rahane kii vajah se yahaan ke logon kii bhaawanaaon ko acchhee tarah jaanate hai
 Let me tell you that the shooting of this film was earlier to be done in the historical fort of Chittorgarh, but in view of the opposition of Karni Sena, the entire setup of the fort for the film was set in Mumbai itself

 sarkarein vikaas kii yojanaon ko lekar kis kadar myopic hoti hai isaki taaja misaal he bihar sarkaar kii ganga water lift yojana
 After the approval of the cabinet of the Bihar government on the evening of 18 December, Water Resources Minister of the state Sanjay Kumar Jha said in a tearful tweet: "I am delighted with the Cabinet approval for the proposal of the Ministry of Water Resources
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar kii jal jivan hariyaali abhiyaan ke tahat yah bahumukhi or anuthi yojana ganga water lift skim gaya, bodhgaya or rajgir jaise shaharon main peyajal muhaiyaa karaayegi
 "his next tweet was more informative in which the Water Resources Minister of Bihar stated," The budget for the first phase of the Ganga water lift scheme is Rs 2836 crore and will provide 43 MCM (million cubic meters) water to Gaya and 7 MCM water to Rajgir
 yah jal donon aitihaasik or dharmik mahatv ke donon shaharon kii jaruraton ke lihaaj se paryaapt hoga
 "jha's third tweet was enough to tell that the water of the Ganges would be left for the devotees to bathe in the river Falgu
 kyonki is baari-bharkam bajet vaali yojana kaa kuch phayda to aam logon ke liye dikhnaa chahie tha
 According to Jha's tweet, 'this scheme is part of the Bihar government's effort to provide clean water to the river Falgu
 'sawaal he ki aakhir is yojana ko lekar shaq kyon he?shaq isliye he ki phalgu nadi ko aakhir ganga kaa pani chahie hi kyon? gaya jile main barish kam nahin hoti
 On visiting the site of the Meteorological Department, the statistics show that the average rainfall in the entire area of gaya is around 110 cm
 lekin sachaai yah he ki gaya nagar nigam ke tahat aane vaale 70 fisadi gharon main nal kaa pani nahin aata
 Ground water is rapidly falling down throughout the district
 yah sthiti tab he jab gaya main phalgu nadi ke saath hi saath pados main do or nadiyaan, jamuni or morhar maujuud hai
 Two years ago, the District Magistrate of Gaya, Sanjay Singh had planned to take the water of these rivers to the city
 par is yojana kaa namelewa koi nahin bachaa
 After all, the government really wanted to do something big in the name of water
 bihar sarkaar bhi kabhi phalgu ko ganga se jodne to kabhi phalgu ko son nadi se jodne ko lekar duvidha main rahi
 However, the task of bringing the Ganges water from Mokama to Gaya through a 170-km long pipeline is like giving fish to someone, while teaching fishing would have been a better option
 bihar sarkaar ne gaya ke pani kii samasya ko nibatane ke liye gaya ke girte bhoojal ko sudhaarney kii yojana kyon nahin banaai? khaskar tab, jab gaya jaise ilaake main talab or pokhare banaakar or varsha jal sanchayan ke jariye bhumigat jal kaa str thik kiya ja saktaa tha
 Scientists believe that importing water is only an immediate solution to the problem
 watershed management, yani sthaneey barish ko rokkar rakhana, usase bhumigat jal ke str ko durust karnaa or barish ke pani ko rokkar shahar main uski aapurti karnaa na sirf dirghakaalik samaadhaan hota balki pipe line bichaane se adhik sasta or twarit bhi hota
 The government should have dug more and more ponds in areas like Gaya, Rajgir and Nawada
 isse machhlee utpaadan bhi badhata, kheton ke sinchai ke liye bhi pani miltaa or kuon main bhi pani aa jaataa
 At the same time it should also be noted that there is still good farming in Gaya area, which is not possible without water
 gaya kaa ilaaka abhi bhi bundelkhand jaisi sthiti main nahin pahunchaa he
 Yes, linking of rivers has come in fashion and fashion, so the matter is different
 duusari taraf, khud ganga apane astitv ke liye lard rahi he
 If 50 MCM of water will be taken out of it in summer, what will be the impact of its ecosystem, Bihar government has done a study of it? In fact, the governments feel that if the water flows into the river and escapes, it will waste water is
 jabaki aisa he nahin or mokama se agar 50 emsm pani nikaal liya jayega to uske aage badi maatra main nadi ke bed main gaad bhi jamaa hogi
 Is the state government ready for that? Watershed management would also prove to be very effective in the kind of land around Gaya
 pichhali garmiyon main mithila kshetra ke darbhanga or madhubani jaise jilon main bhi amuman saalon bhar pani se bhare rahane vaale pokhare suukh gaye the, vaise main unako jilane kii koi yojana sarkaar kii nigaah main nahin he
 However, the way the plan to send Ganga water to Gaya is ready to be implemented quickly and the way funds have been released for it, the question of the developmental vision of the government has become even deeper

 India currently occupy the second position in the World Cup points table with 13 points
 agar bharat apana aglaa muqabla jeet jaataa he or australia south africa ke khilaaf mukaable main haar jaataa he to bharat number ek par pahunch jayega

 We all have such a rich and unique treasure of our respective experiences of our lives that there can be no alternative
 yah hamaari apni-apni sabase badi daulat he, basharte ki ham use aisa samajhen
 Our own experience is a shining mirror in which we can see all the events of our past happening, analyze them, and make correct conclusions based on those analyzes
 lekin mushkil yah he ki ham dusron ke saamne bade joardaar tareeke se yah daawa to karte hai ki 'maine bal dhoop main safed nahin kiye hai,' lekin zyaadaatar logon ke sir ke bal dhoop main hi safed hote hai
 If someone repeats the same mistakes he made 35 years ago, what would you call him? Even more worrying is that even after repeating the same mistakes, he hopes that the results do not repeat themselves
 yah manushya kaa ek bahut hi sookshm or anternihit swabhaav he, jisase ubarne ke liye chetana main bahut hi gahari ichhashakti kii jarurat hoti he
 It is very lacking in most people

 Since we cannot capture our experiences, we are not able to take advantage of it
 chunki uskaa phayda nahin uthaa pate, isliye uski keemat nahin samaj pate
 And we all know that man is so greedy by nature that he does not appreciate it until he finds the value of something
 jitani acchhee keemat utani badi kadra
 Hopefully! That he could understand his experiences as synonymous with his life! From the day this happens, the focus of his actions and thoughts will be experienced rather than life

 Apparently, his outward journey will turn towards an inner journey
 main is baat kaa daawa kar saktaa hum ki usee din se uskaa sab kuch badal jayega or uskaa yah badlaav uski behatari ke liye hoga
 Think about this small but very practical question of mine
 aapke paas abhi ek car he, jisaki keemat paanch lakh rupee he
 The only responsibility of the car is to transport you from one place to another with ease without any hindrance
 abhi kii aapaki car apane is kaam ko acchhee tarah anjaam de rahi he
 But one day you sell that car and buy another car instead, which costs 12 lakh rupees
 jaahir he ki yadi upyogita ke lihaaj se dekhen, to aapaki yah car bhi vahi kaam karegi, jo pehle vaali car kar rahi thi
 So my question is, why did you sell the first car? It didn't work because you didn't need that car
 yadi aisa hota to aap duusari car nahin lete
 You bought a second car, which was more than twice as expensive as the first car
 to yahaan aapse meraa sawaal keval yah he ki aapane aisa kiya kyon? Here you should not mistake me as an opponent of materialism
 yadi maine yahaan mahangi car kaa udhaaharan diya he, to aap iskaa matlab yah na lagaaein ki main acchhee or mahangi kaaron kaa virdohi hum
 They have their own utility in the economic field
 yahaan meraa sambandh isse nahin he
 i am talking about life here
 aapke paas mere is prashn kaa apana koi bhi uttar ho saktaa he
 But the answer i have is that 'you bought a new car only because you liked it by buying it
 ' bahut chota-sa kaaran maine diya he- 'acha laga he
 'how many times do we use this jumla in our everyday life - it feels good or does not feel good or it just directly feels bad
 hai ye teenon ek hi, kyonki in teenon vichaaron or bhaawanaaon ko sanchalit karne vaala jo mul centre he, vah he- 'acha'
 Doesn't this prove that life is just an experience
 ' What happened in the country, the world, metropolitan sports, economic and Bollywood
 jaanane ke liye yahaan padhein samay ke saath saath khabaron kaa apadation
