 Investigators in the Samjhauta Express blast case have claimed that they have found evidence of the alleged involvement of right-wing activist Swami Aseemanand in this 2007 terror incident
 jaanch prakriya se jude sutron ne kaha ki rashtriya jaanch agency (enie) kii jaanch ke baad ab yah spasht hota ja rahaa he ki aseemanand or uske saathi samjhauta visphot main shaamil the
 Home Minister p Chidambaram had yesterday said, "the NIA has made some progress in the Samjhauta blast case
" use kuch suraag hasil hua he
 He refused to give any further details, saying that he could not make public any other information related to the case
 samjhauta express main hue visphot main 68 log maare gayi the
 NIA had detained Abhinav Bharat member Swami Aseemanand from Panchkula
 is bich sutron ne bataaya ki enie kii jaanch kaa ek bindu is ore bhi he ki visphot main istemaal ardex kii aapurti kisne kii thi
 Aseemanand's real name is Jatin Chatterjee and he was living in Haridwar by fake name
 usne farji pahchaan patr bhi hasil kar liya tha
 Investigators have recovered a passport issued by the Regional Passport Officer of Kolkata, ration card issued by Haridwar officials and election card from Aseemanand
 aseemanand kaa naam makka or ajmer visphoton kii jaanch ke dauraan saamne aayaa tha lekin jaanch agenciyon ko uski pahchaan ke bare main tab adhik jaankaree nahin thi
 Central agencies and Maharashtra's anti-terrorism Squad raided various locations in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat in search of Aseemanand in 2009-10 but were not caught
 maharashtra kii gathbandhan sarkaar ke shaatir architect sharad pavaar ne vipaksh ke liye ek nayaa agenda tay kar diya he - BJP ke dohare mandandon kii pole kholo, pradhanmantri ko naitik oonchaaiyon par rahane kaa mauka mat do, or choubison ghante aakraamak raho
 So now, the BJP and its chief directors - Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah - should be worried
 sharad pavaar hamaare desh ke sabase shaatir or chatur rajanetaaon main se ek hai, or har shabd behad saavdhaanee se bolte hai
 Speaking in public in a TV interview over an alleged offer made last month by Modi to 'work together' was a well thought out strategy
 abp-maajha ko die gaye intervyuu main sharad pavaar ne kaha tha ki modi ne unki putree supriya sule ko centre sarkaar main jagah dene kii bhi peshkash kii thi, basharte vah maharashtra main sarkaar banane ke liye BJP ke saath aa jaaen
 This 'indecent offer' to Sharad Pawar was made after he and his party, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) were publicly praised in Parliament
 pavaar ke mutabik, unhone kaha, "shukriya, lekin nahin chahie
 
 
 "the purported offer was made in a meeting between Modi and Pawar on November 20, when a tug of war between the BJP and their rivals over the formation of government in Maharashtra was going on, and the formation was stuck only because of anti-bjp parties There was mistrust and their ideologies were completely opposite from each other
 maharashtra main satta paane kii BJP kii lipsaa ko ujagar karne ke liye modi kii peshkash par pavaar us vakt saarvajanik hue, jab devendra fadanvis ko mukhyamantri banane dene ke liye tadake hi raashtrapati shashan hataa dene ko lekar pradhanmantri ke aalochak un par apni chhavi or saakh se samjhauta karne ke aarope laga rahe the
 During the election campaign in the state, Modi had been consistently calling the NCP a 'naturally corrupt party'
 sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ke saath unki party kaa 72-ghante kaa gathbandhan us samay tut gaya, jab sharad pavaar apane bhattije ko apane paale main waapas le gaye, or uske baad shivasena, NCP or congress ke gathbandhan ne uddhav thakare ko sabase aage rakhkar maharashtra kii satta sambhaal lee
 Till now Modi has been successfully presenting himself as an anti-corruption agitator who says - 'I will not eat, nor will i eat
 
 
 'maharashtra ke 'missadeventure' ke baad BJP ke liye chal rahe aalochana ke daur ko pavaar ke daawey se hawa mili, jisane modi ke saarvajanik daavon main chhed kar diya, or satta ke liye BJP kii lipsaa ko puri tarah ujagar kar diya
 Sharad Pawar made sure that Modi and BJP could no longer claim to live on the heights of morality
 lekin modi kii peshkash ko sabake saamne laakar pavaar ne unke saath judane kii sambhaavnaaon ko bhi puri tarah khatm kar daalaa
 This was different, because Pawar is known for the fact that his friends are in every camp
 modi apni majboot yaaddaasht or shikayaton ko nahin bhuulane ke liye jane jate hai
 In this story brought out by Pawar, Modi came out as a person with double standards, who has no principles, and whom Pawar will not tolerate at all
 to phir pavaar ne yah khatra kyon uthaaya, jabaki jaanch agenciyon ke istemaal samet kai sakht tareekon se apane pratidwandviyon ko nishaanaa banane kaa mauka unhen centre sarkaar se kareebi hone ke kaaran mil saktaa tha
 
 
 The He wanted to indicate to his coalition partners in Maharashtra - Uddhav Thackeray and the Congress - that he was a definite teammate, and that his image as a man of loyalty changed with the changing seasons
 asthir sahyogi kii chhavi vaale pavaar ne uddhav thakare ko aashwast karne kii koshish kii he ki vah maharashtra main hui saajheedaari ko lambe samay tak nibhaane ke liye katibaddh hai, or koi anya vikalp nahin talash rahe hai
 Advisers of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had also tried to convince them for a long time that Pawar should not be trusted
 pavaar ne saarvajanik hokar unhen chuppi saadhane par majaboor kar diya
 According to sources in Congress, Sonia Gandhi, who practiced politics, went completely into the game of government formation in Maharashtra according to Pawar, and now it seems, after the formation of her government, everything Pawar proved to be true
 congress ke ek varisht netaa ne mujhe bataaya, "congress tathaa vipaksh kii haalat yah ho gai he ki sonia gandhi saarvajanik rup se pavaar tathaa mamata banerjee (pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri) jaise congress se tuutakar gaye netaaon se congress party kii chhatrachhaaya main laut aane ke liye kahati hai
 
 
 By the way, bringing back regional leaders with roots is the only way the opposition will challenge Modi's BJP
 
 
 lekin congress kaa durbhaagya he ki rahul gandhi aise kisi kadam ke sakht khilaaf hai
 
 
 "after taking over as chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray overturned major decisions of the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis, including the controversial car shed project (part of the Mumbai metro project), for which thousands of trees were cut down, without losing time
 Gaya, and also made it clear that he can also cancel Modi's dream project of running a bullet train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad
 vaise, pavaar ne sirf modi ko hi nishaanaa nahin banaaya he
 He also stated that he was the judge b

 Sharad Yadav, both inside and outside the Parliament, keeps his bar on the most difficult issue and holds it aloof
 aise main ajtak samvaadadaata ne jab sharad yadav se poocha ki neshnal herald maamle main jaanch jaanch ke jo aadesh die gaye kitne sahi hai? is sawaal ke jawaab main sharad yadav ne kaha ki jaanch to pehle bhi ho chuki he is maamle main lekin agar court ek baar or jaanch karwaanaa chaahati he to ye acchhee baat he
 On the issue of triple talaq, Sharad Yadav said that the government should not work to improve the society

 In such a situation, it is not right to mention only one religion or class fault
 hindu dharm main bhi kai khamia he

 The Bombay High Court gave big relief to actor Govinda on Friday
 hoicourt ne unki agrim jamaanat kii arji manjuur kar lee
 In fact, a magistrate court in Pakur, Jharkhand has issued a notice asking Govinda to appear in the hearing on 6 March
 bombai hoicourt ne kaha he ki agar govinda ko giraftaar kiya jaataa he to unki 25,000 rupye ke nijee muchalke or ek jamaanti ke aadhaar par tatkaal jamaanat sweekaar kar lee jaae
 Govinda had approached the Bombay High Court for anticipatory bail in the 20-year-old case
 ye maamla 1996 main relies hui film 'chote sarkaar' ke gane 'ek chummaa tu mujhako udhaar de de' se judaa he
 Expressing the same objection, a lawyer filed a case in 1997 under sections 294 (obscene acts and songs), 500 (contempt) etc
 of the IPC
 is gane main bihar kaa naam bhi aayaa tha
 Govinda said in the petition for anticipatory bail in the Bombay High Court that this case was filed only with the intention of humiliating him and spoiling his reputation by arrest
 jis vakt yekes darjakiya gaya tha us vakt pakur bihar main hi aata tha
 Pakud came into being after the formation of a new state of Jharkhand
 govinda ne apni arji main kaha ki unhone sirf film main acting kii or wo gaanaa unhone nahin likhaa tha
 Govinda also said that the lyrics of the song are neither obscene nor defamatory of anyone
 gane ko lekar kisi bhi samudaay, jati, kshetra, varg yaa samaaj kii manahani kaa iraadaa nahin tha
 The Magistrate Court of Pakud has asked lyricist, musician as well as playback singers Udit Narayan and Alka Yagnik to appear on 6 March
 bombai hoicourt se raahat milane ke baad govinda ko ab 6 march ko pakur main court main pesh hone kii jarurat nahin he
 Govinda's lawyer told the Bombay High Court that his client did not even know what was happening in Jharkhand
 govinda ke ghar par jab 27 farvari ko jharkhand police pahunchi to unhen iskaa pataa chalaa
 Although Govinda was not at home at that time
 wo in dinon apni aane vaali film 'aa gaya hero' ke pramotion main vyast hai
 The film is releasing on 16 March
 desh ke muslim samaaj ko is saal bhi raajnneetik galiyaaron se lubhaane kii khub koshishen huin
 Somewhere in the name of reservation, somewhere in the name of development agenda, the struggle to get the vote of this largest minority section of the country is usually seen in all political parties
 raajnneetik muddon ke saath assam hinsa or uttar pradesh evam kuch anya sthanon par bhadki sampradayik hinsa ko lekar bhi muslim jagat main ek tarah kii chintaa dekhi gai
 For this, many Muslim organizations demanded strict laws to prevent communal violence
 islamic jaankaar akhtarul vaase kaa kahana he, ‘desh ko prabhavit karne vaale har mudde or vishay kaa muslim samaaj par baraabar kaa asar hota he
 i believe that this year has been good for the country as a whole and in such a situation was also good for the Muslim society
 aarakshan yaa kuch muddon par koi khaas nateeja nahin dekhne ko mila, lekin loktantr main ummid hameshaa rakhni chahie
 In the beginning of 2012, there was a lot of debate about the central government's decision to provide four and a half percent reservation for minorities in the OBC quota
 uttar pradesh or kuch anya rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle se aae centre ke is faisle ko raajnneetik phayda uthaane kii koshish ke taur par dekha gaya
 It is a matter of fact that the Congress did not benefit in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 aarakshan kaa bhaajapa ne purajor virodh kiya to sapa or basapa ne ise chhalaava qaraar diya
 Meanwhile, in May, the Andhra Pradesh High Court quashed four and a half percent reservation
 ab centre sarkaar kah rahi he ki vah ucchtam nyaayalay main apana paksh vyapak rup se rakhegi
 All India Muslim Personal Law Board member and SP leader Kamal Farooqui says, "the promises made to Muslim society about reservation have not been fulfilled
 centre ne 4
 No concrete steps were taken towards restoring reservation to 5 per cent
 ummid karte hai ki uttar pradesh main meri party is disha main teji se kadam uthaaegi
 'even though the Congress and upa's political claim of reservation has failed, the SP, which promised to give reservation in proportion to the population of Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, benefited immensely
 use rajya vidhansabha ke chunaav main baari bahumat mila
 Attempts to woo the Muslim vote bank in the Gujarat assembly elections At the end of the year, there was an attempt to woo the Muslim vote bank at the time of the Gujarat assembly elections, but unlike the previous elections this time the issue was focused on development

 There is a lot of debate about this too
 kai sthanon par sampradayik hinsaais varsh kai sthanon par sampradayik hinsa bhi hui
 The biggest violence took place in Assam
 isko or myanmar main rohingya muslim virdohi hinsa ko lekar bhartiya musalamaanon ne khulkar apane gusse kaa izhaar kiya
 a similar protest rally was organized on August 11 at Azad Maidan in Mumbai, where violence erupted
 isko lekar bhi jamkar raajnneeti hui
 In Uttar Pradesh, communal violence erupted in Bareilly, Faizabad, Mussoorie in Ghaziabad, Pratapgarh and many other places
 isko lekar akhilesh sarkaar ko muslim sanghathanon kaa kadaa virodh jhelana padaa
 At the beginning of the year, there was a lot of discussion about the opposition of controversial writer Salman Rushdie
 jaipur sahitya mahotsav main rushdi aane vaale the lekin darul ulum devband or kai anya muslim sanghathanon ne iskaa kadaa virodh kiya
 Due to this, his arrival program was postponed
 muslim sanghathan ‘senetic varses’ pustak ke kaaran rushdi kaa virodh karte hai
 In the year 2012, there were many strange fatwas which were debated
 darul ulum ne kai aise fatve jari kiye
 One fatwa said that Namaz is not valid in case of tattoo on the arm and using perfume containing alcohol
 ek anya fatve main kaha gaya ki muslim ladki kisi aphis main resepshanist nahin ho sakati

 dilli main aam aadmi party or congress party ke bich gathbandhan kii sabhi ummiden ab lagbhag khatm hi ho gai hai

 kaaphi lambey samay se AAP kii ore se gathbandhan kii koshishen kii ja rahi thim lekin congress nakaar rahi thi

 On the one hand, where negotiations are going on with the Congress, on the other hand in public statements, they are getting sympathy for the delay in the forehead of the Congress

 Google has a live donation system in which staff members can give their leave to each other if needed
 google aisi pehali company he jahaan aisa koi tarika apanaaya gaya
 According to the news published in Dainik Bhaskar, engineers had once given leave to help one of their colleagues
 iske baad google ne ise policy bana liya
 At the company's 'take Your Parents to Work Day' event, Google's Senior Vice President (HR) Laszlo Bock told the story behind adopting the system
 ‘tech yor parents tu work de’ event main google main kaam kar rahe logon kii family ko google headquarter ghoomane kaa mauka miltaa he
 The comments bok ne bataaya, 'darasal hamaare yahaan pehle saal se lekar tisare saal tak salanaa 15 ped live hi milti hai
 They increase from 20 to 25 in the fourth to sixth year
 kai mushkil maukon par ye chhatityaan naakaafi hoti hai
 a few years ago, one of our partner's parents worsened, he went on vacation
 lekin unki chuttee khatm hone tak parents thik nahin ho paae
 In such a situation, there were only two options, the first - to be on leave after deducting salary, second - to leave the sick parent and return to work
 unke kuch saathi ejiniyaron ko unki mushkil paristhitiyon kii jaankaree thi
 So those people came to me, we discussed
 ham policy to badal nahin sakate the, lihaaja vikalpon par charchaa hui
 Then they gave the idea to donate some holidays from their paid leave
 yah mere liye bada hi innovative or creative idia tha
 In this way, we created Google's vacation donation system
 ab jarurat ke mutabik log sahakarmiyon ko chhuttiyaan donnet karte rahete hai
 In this way, this sequence of leave donation goes on
 ' Obviously, this is a very supportive attitude

 After this, Google made it a policy

 brigs or swaan ko ek-ek wicket mila
 Earlier both teams have lost their one match in Super-8
 newjiland ko srilanka ne or england ko westeindies ne haraaya tha
 In this sense, it is like a fight or die for both the teams because the defeat of any one team will knock them out of the competition

 Here the Congress party was targeted by the PM, as well as he also targeted the Grand Alliance
 unhone kaha ki congress ne nateezon kii taiyaar bhi shuru kar di he, haar ke baad uskaa thikra kiske sir par phode isaki taiyaari congress kar rahi he
 There is practice going on to do what to save Namdar
 raily main PM narendra modi bole ki congress ko namdaar ko bachaane kii koshishen isliye kerani pad rahi hai, kyonki haar kaa thikra unpar nahin phoda ja saktaa he ye vanshavaad ke usulon ke khilaaf hoga
 He said that in order to save Namdar, those who have been martyred by cutting their nails are competing
 bataa den ki pradhanmantri kaa ye bayaan us samay aayaa he jab mahagathbandhan ke sadsy lagaataar baithken kar rahe hai or upie cheirperson sonia gandhi ne bhi vipakshi netaaon se baat kii he
 Also attacked pitroda-iyer: PM Modi said that you must have seen that only after the fifth phase, the two closest courtiers of the Namdar family started batting on their behalf, otherwise they do not dare to play the match without asking the captain
 Get off in the field
 unhone kaha ki ek ballebaaj to namdaar ke guru hai jinhen maidan main utaara gaya he, inhone sikhon kii bhaawanaaon kaa majaak udaate hue kaha ki 84 kaa sikh danga hua to hua!pradhanmantri ne kaha ki vot ke liye mahamilavati kisi ko bhi thag sakate hai
 The Congress ruled the country for many years, but they considered the tribals only as their vote bank
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki ek taraf ham jharkhand ke vikaas ke liye samarpit hai, vahiin duusari taraf jharkhand mukti morcha or congress ke log ghuspaithiyon ke saath khadey hai
 But the BJP is clear that we will identify every single intruder in the country
 ye hamaare sansadhano ke saath-saath hamaari suraksha ke liye bhi bahut bada khatra hai
 The PM said that terrorism is such a challenge which needs to be dealt with very strictly
 lekin congress or uske saathiyon kii nitiyaan aisi rahi hai ki wo aatankwaad or naksalwad ko kuchal nahin saktin
 He said that the Congress now wants to end the sedition law too
 yani patharbaajon, aatankiyon or unke samarthakon, naksaliyon or unhen khaad pani dene waalon ko congress khuli chhot dena chaahati he

 akhabaaron kii ye hedline banaras kii us bebasii ko bayaan kar rahi hai, jisane use swatchta kii ranking main tamaam daavon ke baad bhi aakhri paaydaan par khadey rahane ko majaboor kar diya he
 To make Banaras the cleanest city on the world map, PM Narendra Modi swept its streets

 Not only this, this campaign does not fade, hence the 'navratna of cleanliness' was also declared in Benaras
 lekin banaras ke gali-muhallon main padaa kooda bataata he ki pradhanmantri kii sari kavayad bemaani sabit hui
 The mayor of the city, Ram Gopal Mohle, says that the scale of the cleanliness drive was door to door collection, segmentation, solid waste management, but no work was done by the previous governments
 2009 main siver line daali par STP nahin bana
 
 
 Our Karsanda plant has been closed since 2011

 There is a claim to lift 500 metric tonnes of garbage, but the road to the Ramna dumping area is bad and there is no garbage there due to opposition from the villagers
 kooda gharon main 23 band hai, sirf do khule hai
 Hence, 600 metric tonnes of garbage released every day are plaguing people between roads and streets

 Assistant Municipal Officer of Municipal Corporation Varanasi BK Dwivedi clearly says that we have a legal problem in disposal of garbage
 court main cese he, jameen kaa bhi vivaad he
 For this reason also we cannot dispose of garbage
 jameen mil jaati to hamaare plant lag sakate hai
 We are working for this kooday kaa nistaaran na ho paane kii vajah se use ikattha kar shahar main hi jala diya jaataa he
 Due to this poisonous smoke is also making the winds of Banaras poisonous
 is dhul ko maapne ke liye pradhanmantri kii yojana ke tahat hi banaras ke ardli bazaar main suchakank ke sensor lagaaya gaya
 Its figures came as shocking
 isamen partical piem 10 kii maatra kaa ausat 244 micron prati ghan centimetre he
 It recorded a minimum of 110 and a maximum of 427
 iskaa str 60 micron prati ghan centimetre se kam hona chahie
 The comments isi tarah 10 micron se chote aakaar ke dhul ke kan maanak se 7 guna zyaada paae gaye
 PM2 in that order
 5 kii maatra kaa ausat mila 220
 Its minimum 50 and maximum 500 were recorded in 24 hours, while its volume should be less than 40
 ye bahut khatarnaak sthiti he, jo bataati he ki banaras kii hawa saans lene laayak nahin he
 In Banaras, standing on the last rank of cleanliness, all the promises were kept in abeyance
 agar ab bhi koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya gaya, to banaras main padaa ye kooda vyangy se hamase yahi kahegaa, 'ham pradhanmantri ke sansadeey kshetra ke kooda hai, he kisi main himmat ki hamen haath laga de!' On this 'achievement', the newspapers are also filled with many articles, some of which have the headline 'dutt'
 
 
 phir rah gaye sabase peeche', 'banaras ab bhi sabase gande shaharon kii suchi main', 'swatchta suchi main bhi varanasi rahaa phiseddi'
 
 
 These newspaper headlines are reflecting on Banaras powerlessness, which has forced him to stand on the last spot despite all the claims in the cleanliness rankings
 banaras ko duniya ke nakshe main sabase saaf-suthra shahar banane ke liye piem narendra modi ne isaki galiyon main jhaadu lagaae
 Shovel at Assi Ghat
 itnaa hi nahin ye muhim feeki na pad jaae, isliye 'safai ke navratna' bhi banaras main hi ghoshit kiye
 But the garbage lying in the streets of Banaras shows that all the exercises of the Prime Minister proved fruitless
 shahar ke meyar ram gopal mohale kehete hai ki swatchta abhiyaan kaa jo paimaana tha door tu door collection, segrigeshan, solid west management, is par pichhali sarkaron ne koi kaam nahin kiya tha
 In 2009, STP was not formed on the sewer line Dali

 It is worth noting that in this city with a population of 19 lakhs, garbage extraction is 600 metric tons every day
 500 metric ton kooda uthaane kaa daawa he, lekin ramana damping kshetra kaa rasta kharaab he or graminon ke virodh se vahaan kooda nahin ja rahaa
 Garbage houses are 23 closed, only two are open
 lihaaja har rose 600 metric ton nikalne vaala kooda sadakon or galiyon ke bich logon ke naak main dam kiye hue he
 The helplessness of not being able to lift it has also been shown in the Municipal Corporation officials
 nagar nigam varanasi ke sahaayak nagar adhikari bike dvivedi saaf kehete hai ki kooday ke nistaaran main hamaari vaidhanik samasya he
 There is a case in court, there is also a dispute of land
 is vajah se bhi ham kooday kaa nistaaran nahin kar sakate hai
 If we get land, our plants can be set up
 ham iske liye prayasarat he
 The waste is not collected and is collected and burnt in the city itself
 is vajah se jaharila dhuaan banaras kii hawaaon ko jaharila bhi bana rahaa he
 To measure this dust, index sensors were installed in the orderly market of Benaras under the Prime Minister's plan
 iske aankade chaunkaane vaale aae
 The average amount of particulate PM10 is 244 microns per cubic centimeter
 yah nunatam 110 or adhiktam 427 darz kiya gaya
 Its level should be less than 60 microns per cubic centimeter
 tippaniyan Similarly, dust particles smaller than 10 microns were found to be 7 times more than the standard

 This is a very dangerous situation, which shows that the air of Benaras is not breathable
 swatchta ke aakhri paaydaan par khadey banaras main tamaam vaade dhare ke dhare rah gaye
 If no concrete steps are still taken, then this garbage lying in Benaras will sarcastically say to us, 'we are the litter of the Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency, dare anyone to give us a hand!' banaras ko duniya ke nakshe main sabase saaf-suthra shahar banane ke liye piem narendra modi ne isaki galiyon main jhaadu lagaae

 If no concrete steps are still taken, then this garbage lying in Benaras will sarcastically say to us, 'we are the litter of the Prime Minister's Parliamentary constituency, dare anyone to give us a hand!' taaja maovadi hamale ke baad ek baar phir se desh ke bheetar chintan or vichaaron kii lahar ufaan par he
 Naxalism, once called the biggest threat to the internal security of the country, has once again raised its head
 har baar kii tarah is baar bhi maovadiyon ko ‘kuchalane’ ke alaava or adhik suraksha balon kii tainaati or ‘baahar’ se sena kii madad lene kii baat kii ja rahi he, lekin bharat ke bichon bich chal rahi is jang main kai ankahi or ansulajhi kahaniyaan har roj likhi ja rahi hai jinaki na to reporting ho rahi he or na ve hamen itnaa andolit karti hai jitna ham sab abhi dikh rahe hai
 The area of one lakh square kilometers of Bastar in Chhattisgarh has been in the grip of this arrogance for the last five years
 oparation green hunt shuru hone ke saath hi november 2009 main maine maovadiyon ke camp main jaakar unke ek bade netaa kadyari satyanna reddy urf kosa se baat kii thi
 After the interview ended, Kosa said that the Indian government had made a big mistake in this fight
 jab maine is galati ke bare main poocha to kosa kaa kahana tha ki hamaare khilaaf oparation shuru karne se pehle uskaa jitna vivaran sarkaar ne de diya he vah hamaari pratiraksha or chhapamar hamalon kii ruparekha banane ke liye kaaphi he
 Kosa's gesture was clear - when the government was making a statement about the anti-maoist campaign, the Naxalites were preparing their cadres and spreading the network of informers along with the landmines in that area
 yahi bhul ab tak sarkaar kaa peechha kar rahi he
 In the interview given in the same tour, Kosa said that you will see what we do in the next six months
 suraksha balon kii baari maujuudagi kii vajah se hamane sochaa ki camere par ye bayaan ek shekhi baghaarne se adhik kuch nahin hoga, lekin april 2010 main 76 javaanon ko naksaliyon ne gher kar maaraa or phir teen maheenon ke bheetar 100 se adhik javaanon kii hatya kii
 The government has been increasing the number of security forces there for the last five years and today there are more than 15 thousand paramilitary forces in Bastar, lekin kya suraksha balon kii maujuudagi ne bastar main ek aam adivasee ke liye halaat badale hai? kya isse maovadiyon ke hamale kam hue hai? kya sarkaar kii vikaas kii nitiyaan bastar main jor pakad pai hai
 There is no answer to all the questions, at least there is no faith yes
 isaki sabase badi vajah he ki bastar main police tantra kii eemaandaaree or netaaon kii vishwasaneeyata behad sandigdh he
 The continuation of excesses against the common tribals and the fake cases that the police have done are enough to give oxygen to the propaganda system of the Naxalites
 din ke ujaale main maovadiyon ko bhala bura kehane vaale netaa chunaav ke vakt apane phaayde ke liye unheen naksaliyon se haath milaate hai
 When the Maoists kidnap a collector or other officer, no one knows what agreement the government makes with the Maoists
 sukama, dantewada or bijapur ke ilaake ke adivasee bhale hi hajaar mushkilon se dochaar ho rahe hon, lekin inhen ilaakon main aapako timber mafia sabase mahange endride phone ke saath dikh jaaenge
 In these areas, you will also find owners of the brightest suvs who will tell how much 'benefit' is there in the schemes being done to tackle Naxalism
 kuch saal pehle bastar se korba main tabadalaa paae hue ek van adhikari ne mujhe kaha tha ki bastar main itnaa paisa he ki jo bhi vahaan jaataa he vah kabhi waapas aana nahin chahta
 In 2010, Dantewada ACP Amresh Mishra said in a conversation that apart from the police, everyone is having fun here
 sawaal yah he ki naksalwad ko kya kaagajon main ladaa jayega yaa sirf javaanon ko maut ke munh main dhakel kar ladaa jayega
 The government has told its jawans not to shoot only in the tribal areas, but also to win the hearts and minds of the people there
 agar logon kaa dil jeetna bhi javaanon kaa kaam he to netaa kya karenge? kya sarkaar chaahati he ki netaaon ke hisse kaa kaam bhi jawan hi karen? For the first time, leaders have been attacked in Chhattisgarh, but the whole debate has been limited to Naxalism
 kya ye sawaal nahin uthanaa chahie ki ek raajnneetik party ke numaayindon ko sarkaar neshnal hive par bhi suraksha kyon nahin de pai? The debate on Maoism is beneficial for the government as it diverts attention from the main issue
 maowad ke khilaaf to sarkaar pichley kai saal se lard rahi he, lekin agar maovadi dur daraaj ke ilaakon se baahar aakar neshnal hive par hi itnaa bada hamalaa karne lage, jahaan 10 kilometre ke daayre main do thane hon, to kya ye naksalwad ke khilaaf ladaai kii niyat par sawaal nahin uthaata? There is also a question about the coverage of Naxalism
 khaastaur se tivi par hone vaali kawarej ko lekar, kisi bhi naksali hamale ke baad tamaam channelon par export icttha ho jate hai or ye ek badi media event banati he, lekin inhen adivasee ilaakon main jo log shantipurna tareekon se sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf lard rahe hai unhen media kitna cover karata he
 The comments urisa ke jagatsinghpur main korian company posco ke khilaaf khadey adivaasiyon kii kahani kya tivi ke liye mahatvapurn nahin he? naksali khun kharaba kar rahe hai, lekin pichhali 17 may ko bijapur ke adsametta main siarpief ke cobra javaanon ke haath maare gaye aath adivaasiyon kii kahani ne tivi screen ko kyon nahin jhakzora? South Bastar is the stronghold of the Maoists but why are the Maoists not talking about the rights of the tribals spreading their 'agitation' in northern Chhattisgarh where the looting of minerals is happening the most? Why do these questions not arise in any newspaper or TV channel or why no national level leader or expert speaks on this? kosa ne intervyuu khatm hone ke baad kaha ki bharat sarkaar ne is ladaai main ek badi galati kii he
 When i asked about this mistake, Kosa said that the details given by the government before starting the operation against us is enough to outline our defense and guerrilla attacks
 kosa kaa ishaara saaf tha - jab sarkaar maowad virdohi abhiyaan ke bare main bayaanbaji kar rahi thi to naksali us ilaake main jagah-jagah barudi surangen lagane ke saath-saath apane kader ko taiyaar kar rahe the or mukhabiron kaa network failaa rahe the
 The same mistake is still pursuing the government
 usee daure main die gaye intervyuu main kosa ne kaha tha ki aap dekhnaa agle chah maheenon main ham kya karte hai
 Due to the heavy presence of security forces, we thought that this statement on camera would be nothing more than a boasting, but in April 2010, 76 soldiers were surrounded by Naxalites and then killed more than 100 soldiers within three months
 sarkaar pichley paanch saal se vahaan suraksha balon kii sankhya badha rahi he or aaj bastar main 15 hajaar se adhik ardhsainik bal hai, But has the presence of security forces changed the situation for a common tribal in Bastar? Has this reduced Maoist attacks? Has the government's development policies been able to get a foothold in Bastar
 sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab na nahin to kam se kam koi vishwaas bharaa haa bhi nahin he
 The biggest reason for this is that the honesty of the police system in Bastar and the credibility of the leaders is highly doubtful
 police ne aam adivaasiyon ke khilaaf jyadatiyon kaa jo silsilaa jari rakhaa he or jo farji mukademe kiye hai ve naksaliyon ke prachaar tantra ko oxigen dene ke liye kaaphi he
 In the light of day, the leaders who call Maoists bad, join hands with the same Naxalites for their benefit during the elections
 jab maovadi kisi colector yaa duusare adhikari ko agava kar lete hai to sarkaar maovadiyon ke saath kya samjhauta karti he kisi ko pataa nahin chalata
 The tribals of Sukma, Dantewada and Bijapur areas may be getting in trouble for a thousand times, but in these areas you will see the Timber Mafia with the most expensive Android phones
 inhen ilaakon main aapako sabase chamakdaar esayuvi ke maalik bhi milenge jo bataaenge ki naksalwad se nibatane main chal rahi yojanaon kaa kitna ‘phayda’ he
 a few years ago a forest officer transferred from Bastar to Korba told me that there is so much money in Bastar that anyone who goes there never wants to come back
 2010 main dantewada ke asipi amaresh mishra ne baatcheet main kaha ki police ke alaava yahaan har koi mouj kar rahaa he
 The question is whether Naxalism will be fought on paper or will be fought only by pushing the soldiers to death
 sarkaar ne apane javaanon se kaha he ki adivasee ilaakon main sirf goli na chalaaen balki vahaan jaakar logon kaa dilon-dimag bhi jeeten
 If winning the hearts of the people is also the job of the jawans, what will the leaders do? Does the government want the youth to do the work of the leaders' part as well? pehali baar chhattisgarh main netaaon par hamalaa hua he, lekin sari bahes naksalwad par simit ho gai he
 Shouldn't this question arise why the government could not provide security to the representatives of a political party even on the national highway? maowad par hone vaali bahes sarkaar ke liye phydemand he kyonki vah mukhya mudde se dhyaan bhatkaati he
 The government has been fighting against Maoism for the last several years, but if the Maoists come out of the far flung areas and start such a big attack on the National Highway, where there are two police stations within a radius of 10 km, will this fight against Naxalism Does not question the intention of ek sawaal naksalwad kii kawarej ko lekar bhi he
 Especially on TV coverage, after any Naxalite attack, experts get collected on all the channels and it becomes a big media event, but in these tribal areas people who are fighting against government policies in peaceful ways How much does the media cover them
 tippaniyan Is the story of tribals standing against Korean company Posco in Jagatsinghpur in Odisha not important for TV? The Naxalites are bloodshed, but why did the story of the eight tribals killed in the hands of CRPF cobra jawans at Edsametta in Bijapur on May 17 not shake the TV screen? dakshin bastar maovadiyon kaa garh he lekin adivaasiyon ke adhikaron kii baat karne vaale maovadi uttari chhattisgarh main apana ‘andolan’ kyon nahin failaa rahe jahaan khanijon kii lut sabase adhik ho rahi he? ye sawaal kisi akhbaar yaa tivi channel main kyon nahin uthte yaa rashtriya str kaa koi netaa yaa export is par kyon nahin bolta? Kosa's gesture was clear - when the government was making a statement about the anti-maoist campaign, the Naxalites were preparing their cadres and spreading the network of informers along with the landmines in that area
 yahi bhul ab tak sarkaar kaa peechha kar rahi he

Why do these questions not arise in any newspaper or TV channel or why no national level leader or expert speaks on this? yahi bhul ab tak sarkaar kaa peechha kar rahi he
 In the interview given in the same tour, Kosa said that you will see what we do in the next six months
 suraksha balon kii baari maujuudagi kii vajah se hamane sochaa ki camere par ye bayaan ek shekhi baghaarne se adhik kuch nahin hoga, lekin april 2010 main 76 javaanon ko naksaliyon ne gher kar maaraa or phir teen maheenon ke bheetar 100 se adhik javaanon kii hatya kii
 The government has been increasing the number of security forces there for the last five years and today there are more than 15 thousand paramilitary forces in Bastar, lekin kya suraksha balon kii maujuudagi ne bastar main ek aam adivasee ke liye halaat badale hai? kya isse maovadiyon ke hamale kam hue hai? kya sarkaar kii vikaas kii nitiyaan bastar main jor pakad pai hai
 There is no answer to all the questions, at least there is no faith yes
 isaki sabase badi vajah he ki bastar main police tantra kii eemaandaaree or netaaon kii vishwasaneeyata behad sandigdh he
 The continuation of excesses against the common tribals and the fake cases that the police have done are enough to give oxygen to the propaganda system of the Naxalites
 din ke ujaale main maovadiyon ko bhala bura kehane vaale netaa chunaav ke vakt apane phaayde ke liye unheen naksaliyon se haath milaate hai
 When the Maoists kidnap a collector or other officer, no one knows what agreement the government makes with the Maoists
 sukama, dantewada or bijapur ke ilaake ke adivasee bhale hi hajaar mushkilon se dochaar ho rahe hon, lekin inhen ilaakon main aapako timber mafia sabase mahange endride phone ke saath dikh jaaenge
 In these areas, you will also find owners of the brightest suvs who will tell how much 'benefit' is there in the schemes being done to tackle Naxalism
 kuch saal pehle bastar se korba main tabadalaa paae hue ek van adhikari ne mujhe kaha tha ki bastar main itnaa paisa he ki jo bhi vahaan jaataa he vah kabhi waapas aana nahin chahta
 In 2010, Dantewada ACP Amresh Mishra said in a conversation that apart from the police, everyone is having fun here
 sawaal yah he ki naksalwad ko kya kaagajon main ladaa jayega yaa sirf javaanon ko maut ke munh main dhakel kar ladaa jayega
 The government has told its jawans not to shoot only in the tribal areas, but also to win the hearts and minds of the people there
 agar logon kaa dil jeetna bhi javaanon kaa kaam he to netaa kya karenge? kya sarkaar chaahati he ki netaaon ke hisse kaa kaam bhi jawan hi karen? For the first time, leaders have been attacked in Chhattisgarh, but the whole debate has been limited to Naxalism
 kya ye sawaal nahin uthanaa chahie ki ek raajnneetik party ke numaayindon ko sarkaar neshnal hive par bhi suraksha kyon nahin de pai? The debate on Maoism is beneficial for the government as it diverts attention from the main issue
 maowad ke khilaaf to sarkaar pichley kai saal se lard rahi he, lekin agar maovadi dur daraaj ke ilaakon se baahar aakar neshnal hive par hi itnaa bada hamalaa karne lage, jahaan 10 kilometre ke daayre main do thane hon, to kya ye naksalwad ke khilaaf ladaai kii niyat par sawaal nahin uthaata? There is also a question about the coverage of Naxalism
 khaastaur se tivi par hone vaali kawarej ko lekar, kisi bhi naksali hamale ke baad tamaam channelon par export icttha ho jate hai or ye ek badi media event banati he, lekin inhen adivasee ilaakon main jo log shantipurna tareekon se sarkaar kii nitiyon ke khilaaf lard rahe hai unhen media kitna cover karata he

Why do these questions not arise in any newspaper or TV channel or why no national level leader or expert speaks on this? sarkaar pichley paanch saal se vahaan suraksha balon kii sankhya badha rahi he or aaj bastar main 15 hajaar se adhik ardhsainik bal hai, But has the presence of security forces changed the situation for a common tribal in Bastar? Has this reduced Maoist attacks? Has the government's development policies been able to get a foothold in Bastar
 sabhi sawaalon kaa jawaab na nahin to kam se kam koi vishwaas bharaa haa bhi nahin he
 The biggest reason for this is that the honesty of the police system in Bastar and the credibility of the leaders is highly doubtful
 police ne aam adivaasiyon ke khilaaf jyadatiyon kaa jo silsilaa jari rakhaa he or jo farji mukademe kiye hai ve naksaliyon ke prachaar tantra ko oxigen dene ke liye kaaphi he
 In the light of day, the leaders who call Maoists bad, join hands with the same Naxalites for their benefit during the elections
 jab maovadi kisi colector yaa duusare adhikari ko agava kar lete hai to sarkaar maovadiyon ke saath kya samjhauta karti he kisi ko pataa nahin chalata
 The tribals of Sukma, Dantewada and Bijapur areas may be getting in trouble for a thousand times, but in these areas you will see the Timber Mafia with the most expensive Android phones
 inhen ilaakon main aapako sabase chamakdaar esayuvi ke maalik bhi milenge jo bataaenge ki naksalwad se nibatane main chal rahi yojanaon kaa kitna ‘phayda’ he
 a few years ago a forest officer transferred from Bastar to Korba told me that there is so much money in Bastar that anyone who goes there never wants to come back
 2010 main dantewada ke asipi amaresh mishra ne baatcheet main kaha ki police ke alaava yahaan har koi mouj kar rahaa he
 The question is whether Naxalism will be fought on paper or will be fought only by pushing the soldiers to death
 sarkaar ne apane javaanon se kaha he ki adivasee ilaakon main sirf goli na chalaaen balki vahaan jaakar logon kaa dilon-dimag bhi jeeten
 If winning the hearts of the people is also the job of the jawans, what will the leaders do? Does the government want the youth to do the work of the leaders' part as well? pehali baar chhattisgarh main netaaon par hamalaa hua he, lekin sari bahes naksalwad par simit ho gai he
 Shouldn't this question arise why the government could not provide security to the representatives of a political party even on the national highway? maowad par hone vaali bahes sarkaar ke liye phydemand he kyonki vah mukhya mudde se dhyaan bhatkaati he
 The government has been fighting against Maoism for the last several years, but if the Maoists come out of the far flung areas and start such a big attack on the National Highway, where there are two police stations within a radius of 10 km, will this fight against Naxalism Does not question the intention of ek sawaal naksalwad kii kawarej ko lekar bhi he
 Especially on TV coverage, after any Naxalite attack, experts get collected on all the channels and it becomes a big media event, but in these tribal areas people who are fighting against government policies in peaceful ways How much does the media cover them
 tippaniyan Is the story of tribals standing against Korean company Posco in Jagatsinghpur in Odisha not important for TV? The Naxalites are bloodshed, but why did the story of the eight tribals killed in the hands of CRPF cobra jawans at Edsametta in Bijapur on May 17 not shake the TV screen? dakshin bastar maovadiyon kaa garh he lekin adivaasiyon ke adhikaron kii baat karne vaale maovadi uttari chhattisgarh main apana ‘andolan’ kyon nahin failaa rahe jahaan khanijon kii lut sabase adhik ho rahi he? ye sawaal kisi akhbaar yaa tivi channel main kyon nahin uthte yaa rashtriya str kaa koi netaa yaa export is par kyon nahin bolta?

 It is being told that ministers from BJP quota have offered their resignations in front of the state president of the party
 ab is par antim faisla party pradesh adhyaksh ko hi lenaa he
 However, if this happens, it is not a threat to the Jammu and Kashmir government
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pidipi ke saath bijepi ke gathbandhan par is faisle kaa asar najar nahin aayega
 It is just a matter of resignation of ministers
 kaha ja rahaa he ki is istife se rajya kii pidipi-bijepi sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin hoga
 According to sources, all BJP ministers are being asked to resign because the cabinet of the Mehbooba government has to be reshuffled
 sarkaar ke andruni sutron kaa kahana he ki rajya main bijepi ke mantriyon kii jimmedaari badali jaani he
 The resignation was taken the day before by two BJP ministers who took out a rally in support of the Kathua gang rape accused in the state
 ye mantri choudhary laal singh or chander prakaash ganga the
 After his resignation, Deputy Chief Minister of BJP Dr
 nirmal kumaar singh, bali bhagat, chering dorajay, shamlaal choudhary, abdul gani kohli, sunil kumaar sharma, priya sethi or ajay nanda sarkaar main shaamil hai
 Let us know from the BJP quota that assembly elections were held in the state in 2015
 jisamen kisi bhi party ko purna bahumat hasil nahin hua tha
 After which the BJP emerged as the largest party, forming the government under the leadership of Mufti Mohammed Sayeed in association with the PDP
 mufti said kii cabinet main bijepi cote se kul 11 mantri shaamil kiye gaye, jinamein pipuls conference party ke sajaad gani lone ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 Among BJP leaders, the post of Deputy Chief Minister was given to Dr
 Nirmal Singh
 mufti said kii maut ke baad unki beti mahabuuba mufti soobe kii kaman sambhaal rahi hai
 Currently, Nirmal Kumar Singh, Bali Bhagat, Sajjad Gani Lone, Charing Dorje, Shyam Lal Chaudhary, Abdul Ghani Kohli, Sunil Kumar Sharma, Priya Sethi and Ajay Nanda are part of the Mehbooba Mufti cabinet from BJP quota
 jabaki laal singh or chandra prakaash kaa haal hi main istipha manjuur hua he
 Resignation on support of gangrape and murderers When the Kathua incident came to light recently, two BJP quota ministers Lal Singh and Chandra Prakash Ganga were accused of taking out a rally in support of the accused
 iske baad vivaad ne tool pakadaa to donon mantriyon ko apana istipha dena padaa
 However, in the meantime, news also started coming up about the BJP-PDP alliance
 lekin party netaaon kii taraf se aise koi sanket nahin mili
 Meanwhile, now the rest of the BJP quota ministers have also offered to resign, raising fears of a political crisis in the state
 uttarakhand ke shri nagar main ek chaatra se balaatkaar kaa ek maamla saamne aayaa he
 It is alleged that the jawan of the Institute of Defense Building Practices (IDBP) is accused
 jawan ne bhi mana he ki usne sex kiya he, lekin balaatkaar nahin kiya
 However, the police are considering it as a rape
 is jawan kaa naam shankar bataaya gaya he or uttarakhand kaa rahane vaala he

 According to a website, Laxman said, the selectors have forgotten that the next tour is of South Africa
 is shrunkhlaa ke liye koi yojana honi chahie
 When the Indian team goes to South Africa, it should have a mixture of both youth and experience

 odisha ke sarkari aspataal main vaahan nahin milane par shav ko kandhe par le jane ke jhakzorne vaale video ke baad uttar pradesh ke pilibhit main bhi shav ko thele par le jane kaa video viral hua he
 In a video aired on social media on Saturday morning, a young man named Suraj is shown carrying the body of his 70-year-old father Tulsiram on the cart
 pilibhit shahar ke madinashaah muhalle ke rahane vaale majdoor suraj ke anusaar shuukravaar raat ko pita kii tabiyat kharaab hone par usne sarkari ambulance bulaane ke liye phone kiya tha, lekin phone kisi ne nahin uthaaya
 When he reached the emergency ward of the district hospital at eight o'clock in the morning, he was told that he brought the patient at half past nine, before that doctors would not meet him
 baharhaal, saadhe nau baje tulsiram ko aspataal main bhartee kiya gaya
 It is alleged that the elderly Tulsiram, who suffered overnight without treatment, died two hours after his hospitalization
 uske baad vahaan maujuud doctor ne usase shav le jane ko kah diya
 On this, Suraj arranged a hand cart and put it on him and took the body of the father
 isi bich, ek vyakti ne uskaa video bana liya
 Suraj was also asked by the person making the video his name and address
 tippaniyan Significantly, last month, a picture of Dana Manjhi, a resident of Odisha, shaking human sensibilities, went viral, showing Manjhi carrying his wife's body 12 kilometers away on the shoulder after allegedly not delivering the vehicle from the postmortem house
 
 uske baad kanpur samet kuch anya sthanon par bhi aisi hi ghatnaon ke video bhi soshal media par prasaarit hue the
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) According to Sooraj, a laborer of Madinashah locality of Pilibhit city, on Friday night, he had called to call a government ambulance after his father was suffering, but no one picked up the phone
 subah aath baje vah jila aspataal ke immergency ward pahunchaa to use bataaya gaya ki vah marij ko saadhe nau baje lekar aae, usase pehle doctor nahin milenge
 However, Tulsiram was admitted to the hospital at 9:30 pm
 aarope he ki raat bhar ilaaj ke bagaiyr takalif jhel chuke bujurg tulsiram kii aspataal main bhartee hone ke do ghante baad maut ho gai
 After that the doctor present there asked him to take the body
 is par suraj ne ek thele kaa intejaam kiya or usee par daal kar pita kaa shav le gaya
 Meanwhile, a person made her video
 video banane vaale vyakti ne suraj se uskaa naam or pataa bhi poocha tha
 The comments gauratlab he ki pichley maheene odisha ke nivasee dana maanjhi kaa maanviya samvednaaon ko jhakzorne vaali tasviir viral hui thi, jisamen kathith rup se postmortem house se vaahan nahin die jane ke kaaran maanjhi ko patni kaa shav kandhe par ladakar 12 kilometre dur le jate dikhaaya gaya tha

 ) phir hilaa himalay
 Then the land of shivering Kashmir
 5 sitambar kii raat jammu kashmir ke doda or kishtwar main aisa jhatka aayaa ki log apane gharon se dehshat main nikal bhaage
 In September, Kishtwar suffered its second stroke of nature
 to kya ise kudarat kaa ultimatum mana jaehimalay main ho rahi lagaataar halchal se vaaki darane lage hai log
 Geological vibrations have again raised a big question
 kya baar baar mil rahe jatke bhavishya main aane vaale kisi bade vinaashkari bukamp kii chetavanee hai
 On the night of September 5 in Doda and Kishtwar districts of Jammu and Kashmir in the latest case
 41 par dharti aisi hili ki logabagh dehshat main apane apane gharon se baahar nikal pade
 Its intensity on the Richter scale4
 5 maapi gai
 The epicenter of the earthquake was 10 kilometers down in the earth in Kishtwar
 haalanki abhi tak ilaake main janmaal kii haani kii koi khabar nahin ai he lekin log buree tarah se dare hue hai
 This is the eighth earthquake in Kishtwar since August
 akele agast maheene main hi kashmir kaa kishtwar 6 baar kaanp chukaa he
 Not only in Jammu and Kashmir but also in the Uttarakashi district of nearby Uttarakhand, on the morning of September 3
 5 paimaane kaa bukamp record kiya gaya
 That is, a large area of himalayas in North India is constantly shivering
 himalay ke pahaado main ho rahi halchal puure desh main logon kii dhadakanen badha rahi he kyonki bharat kaa ye hissaa bukamp ke lihaaj se kaaphi samvedansheel he
 Most parts of North India and Northeast India are considered very dangerous in case of earthquake and the reason for earthquake here is due to the geological movement in the Himalayas
 plate tectonic theory ke mutabik himalay ke kshetra main bhartiya plate or urasian plate ke bich takaraav chal rahaa he
 The Indian plate is penetrating below the Eurasian plate and because of this, earthquakes keep happening in this area
 har saal amuman 40 se 50 millimetre urasian plate ke neeche ghus jaati he, or yahi vajah he ki himalay bukamp ke lihaaz se duniyabar ke sabase sakriy ilaakon main se ek he
 Repeatedly
 ji haa, shaayad ye chetavanee he bhavishya main aane vaale ek bade khatre kii
 Although scientists are trying day-to-day to deal with this natural disaster, but if nature comes on its own, then whose status is it
 bhugarbha vaigyanikon kii maane to kashmir yun hi baar baar nahin kaanp rahaa he
 In geology, a theory is coming out that is causing panic
 mana jaataa he ki 100 saal main har ilaake main ek baar vinaashkari bukamp jarur aata he
 And it is feared that this time the turn may also be of Kashmir
 bukamp
 
 
 a word that stops hearing good words
 kudarat kaa ek aisa bhayaavah mizaaj jise dekhne or jisase milane kii ichha duniya ke kisi bhi shaks ko nahin hoti he lekin hindustan khaskar jammu kashmir ke logon ko pichley kuch maheenon main baar baar prakruti ke is rup se saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 According to geologists, the Himalayas are the result of a collision between two large tectonic plates of the earth
 takreeban paanch karod saal pehle tectonic plonton ke bich shuru hui takkar aaj bhi jari he
 This is the reason why major earthquakes in the Himalayas are not new
 lekin ek aisi theory saamne aa rahi he jo dehshat kii vajah ban rahi he
 That theory is seismic gap theory
 is theory ke mutabik jin ilaakon main pichley 100 saal se bade bukamp nahin aaen hai vahaan vinaashkari bukamp kii ashanka lagaataar bani hui he
 The area of jammu and Kashmir is also part of this theory of geology
 himalay main 1905 main himachal ke kangra main 7
 There was a dangerous earthquake of 5 magnitude, in which thousands of people died
 pichley saalon main aae bade or chote bukampon kaa adhyayan karne ke baad bhuvaigyanik is nattejey par sahamat hai ki himalay main ek bada bukamp kabhi bhi aa saktaa he
 According to experts, the major earthquakes that are prone to earthquakes of magnitude 8 or more are the areas in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Nepal, the lowland area of bihar and Assam
 aapke liye yakeen karnaa mushkil hoga lekin july 2013 main hi bharat main bukamp ke 19 jatke mahasoos kiye ja chuke hai
 In August, people were scared of 21 jolt of water, while in September, the land of India has been shaken 5 times
 kudarat kaa ishaara saaf he
 Now we have to be careful
 hindustan main bukamp se bachaav ke liye abhi bhi vaigyanikon kii koshish jari he
 a laboratory has been built in Tehri, Uttarakhand, where a close examination of the vibrations of the earth is being done to make India more secure in future
 vaigyanik is nattejey par to pahunch chuke hai ki himalay main ek behad khatarnaak bukamp pal rahaahe
 On whose arrival the earth will tremble, mountains will tremble
 lekin is bukamp ke aane kii ashanka kab he, is sawaal par sabaki jubaan khamosh he
 In view of the danger of major earthquake in the Himalayas, scientists have set up the Observatory
 vaigyanikon kii koshish he ki bade bukamp ke pehle hone vaali kisi halchal ko wo pakad saken or isaki sahi sahi jaankaree samay rahete muhaiyaa kara saken
 As part of this effort, an Earthquake Observatory has been set up in Guttu area of tehri, about 50 km from Kedarnath Dham
 bukamp ke dauraan dharti ke andar hone vaali halchal ke dauraan kai chizon main badlaav hota he
 According to scientists, 11 geophysical parameters are being monitored at the Guttu Earthquake Observatory
 bade bukamp se pehle dharti ke gurutvkarshan main badlaav aata he or electromagnetic field main badlaav dekha jaataa he
 In addition, there is also a change in groundwater
 radon gas kii maujuudagi bukamp se pehle bad jaati he
 In addition, rocks in the earthquake zone increase wear and tear
 ye saare badlaav amuman do se 15 din pehle dikh sakate hai
 Geologists believe that whenever there is a big earthquake in the area of kedarnath, they should get the signal before that
 guttu main 11 tarah ke upkaran lagaae gaye hai jo himalay main hone vaali kisi bhi badi halchal ko palak jhapakate pakad sakate hai
 GPS sensors have also been installed here to know the movement in the ground
 isse yahaan par folt ke aasapaas paidaa hue tanaav or jameen main aae kisi badlaav ko aasaani se janaa ja sakegaa
 Experts believe that there is a possibility of major earthquake in this area of himalayas for a long time
 haal hi main uttarakhand ke tamaam ilaakon main bukamp kii halki sugabugahat dekhi ja rahi he
 In such a situation, to avoid the damage caused by a major earthquake, it is very important that this earthquake can be estimated before coming
 guttu main wadiya institute kii jeeophysical lab isi koshish main he ki kisi bade bukamp se pehle uske aane bhavishyavaanee kii ja sake
 If this happens, it will be a huge success and people will be saved from any major loss
 vaigyanikon kii koshish he jab bhi koi bada bukamp aae usase pehle wo usko jaan saken
 So all the devices here are being kept on continuously

 balk esemes par pratibandh lagane ke baad kai mahatvapurn balk esemes bhi logon ko milanaa band ho gayi the, jinamein se videsh mantralay, grih mantralay, patr soochna karyaalay, raajnneetik partiyon ke mahatvapurn sandesh bhi shaamil the jo samay samay par apni gatividhiyon se sambhddha logon ko avgat karaane ke liye balk esemes kiya karte the
 In view of the court decision on the Ayodhya dispute, the Union Home Ministry feared that some mischievous elements might try to spoil the communal harmony by giving provocative messages in the meantime, hence such SMS and MMS were specifically banned
 swayan grih mantri pi chidambaram ne sitambar maheene kii apane mantralay kii pragati rapat pesh karte hue is tathy kaa ullekh kiya tha or samvaadadaataaon ko jaankaree di thi ki agle aadesh tak balk esemes or ms par pratibandh lagu rahegaa
 The Ministry of Home Affairs raised the limit of this ban several times regularly and after reviewing the situation finally implemented it till October 4

 In fact, several media reports had reported the meeting between HS Phoolka and Vijay Goel

 However, HS Phoolka replied on Sunday and wrote on Twitter - meeting with Vijay Goel is not news

 Significantly, HS Phoolka fought a legal battle for the victims of the 1984 anti-sikh riots

 During the debate on the bail plea of former Samajwadi Party (SP) general secretary Amar Singh, accused of alleged involvement in the vote-for-note case, the BJP MP and senior advocate Ram Jethmalani said that during the motion of confidence in 2008 The money for bribing mps did not come from his client but it 'probably came from the bjp's source'
 jethmalani ne vishesh nyaayadhish sangeeta dhingra sahagal kii adaalat main kaha, ‘amar singh ke khilaaf dhan jutaney or kisi ko dhan dene kaa koi aarope nahin he
 'jethmalani said in his plea,' LK Advani recently said in the Lok Sabha that this sting was sponsored by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 paisa bhaajapa ke kisi strot se aayaa ho singh ne yah paisa uplabdh nahin karaayaa
 The sting was done to uncover corruption
 isse spasht hota he ki unhone jo kuch bhi kiya vah gaiyrkanoonee nahin tha
 He said that the sting operation in this case was done by a private channel and its purpose was to expose corruption, so there was nothing illegal in what was done by the mps
 jethmalani ne adaalat se kaha, ‘sah aaropee or kathith madhyasth sanjeev saxena (amar singh ke sahyogi) ne adaalat main purv main die apane bayaan main kaha he ki usne bhaajapa saansadon ko paise die
 And in such a situation when the BJP is claiming that it was its sting operation, the money must have come from the party's fund itself
 ’ullekhneey he ki vot ke liye note maamle main amar singh (55) chah sitambar ko giraftaar kiye gaye the or adaalat ne unhen 19 sitambar tak nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya tha
 Is an integral part of India
 bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 Then why are facilities being provided for the visit of mps from external countries in the integral and internal Kashmir of India
 yah abhi tak spasht nahin he ki jab bharat kii line abhinn or aatanrikta kii rahi he to in saansadon ke nijee daure kii sarkari vyavastha kyon karai gai
 This convoy coming out of a hotel in Srinagar is a strange knock in the history of Valley politics
 kaali kaaron ke kafile kaa taalluk kashmir par mandara rahe kaale badalon ke chantane se he yaa gahraane se
 India has been following the same policy so far that Kashmir is an internal matter, but the way a convoy of black cars carrying foreign mps is coming out of this door is giving international color to the interior of Kashmir
 de rahaa he yaa nahin, is par bahes hogi lekin yah tasviir bhi kashmir ke vichlit itihaas main pehali tasviir he jise aaj ke pehle kabhi nahin dekha gaya
 The internality of the Kashmir issue is also an issue of India's self-respect, but the passing of foreign mps on its land must have been hurting someone or will there be zero political consciousness? Whatever the motive of this journey, but how will this picture of the convoy be seen among the leaders of those Hindi states, will the leaders also welcome the picture that the third party, the third faction, has been allowed to run on the soil of Kashmir? is
 is tasviir ko dekhte rahiye, yah tasviir us kashmir ke itihaas main ek mile kaa pathar he jo sardaar patel se shuru hoti he or sardaar patel par khatm hoti he
 Did this happen during Nehru's time? agar hota to sardaar patel kya kehete, yah vaisaa hi sawaal he jaisaa ki yadi sardaar patel bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri hote
 The big question is, who has called these mps? After all, whose homework was behind his calling? This thing was being kept secret, but the secret has been revealed
 aap hairaan honge ki kashmir jaise samvedansheel masale par ek enjio pahal kar rahaa tha, wo email bhej kar saansadon ko bula rahaa tha jis kashmir par bharat kii niti he ki kisi tisare kaa hastkshep nahin hoga
 The language of this email is stating that India was not as ignorant as it was in preparing to call them, otherwise no NGO could send an email that you will visit India on October 28, meet Prime Minister Modi and visit Kashmir on October 29
 aap hindi yaa bhojpuri main soch kar dekhie kya bagaiyr pradhanmantri kii jaankaree ke daura ho saktaa he? aap avadhi or maithili main soch kar dekhie ki kya is daure ke bare main videsh mantralay ko jaankaree thi? darasal ham bhale na is enjio ke bare main jaanate hon, inke chehron ko na pahachaanate hon, lekin ye log itane bhi gumnaam nahin hai
 You see in this picture
 pradhanmantri ke saath jo mahila hai wo maadi sharma hai
 Standing comfortable with India's most powerful leader, Madi Sharma is followed by only 2,427 people on Twitter
 maadi sharma khud ko soshal capitalist bataati hai
 She calls herself an International Business Broker
 shiksha udhyami kahati hai
 The speaker says
 inaki website bhi he
 Madi means Make a Difference Ideas
 apni bevesite main maadi sharma likhti hai ki ethnic minurity ke akele maa baap ko sahaara detii hai
 But Madi Sharma sends an invitation to Kashmir to those parties whose politics is against ethnic minorities
 to kya kamazor kii madad kaa sahaara lekar chhavi banane kaa yah maamla he yaa koi pardaa he jiske peeche kaa kaam kuch or he
 How can a woman who calls herself an International Business Broker interfere so much in Kashmir? ye koun hai jo pradhanmantri se milaane kaa vaada european sangh ke saansadon se kar sakati hai
 After all, how did Madi Sharma have such a reach or role in such a sensitive matter
 kya bharat ke videsh mantralay kii jaankaree main ye maadi sharma ke enjio ne european sangh ke saansadon ko email bheja tha
 Our colleague Sanket Upadhyay has received this email whose language states that the tour which is being described as private is not that much
 bulaane vaale ke paas pehle se pradhanmantri modi kii sahmati rahi hogi ki ye saansad aaenge to mulaakaat hogi
 After all, what is the need that the Government of India has to seek the help of an NGO in a case like Kashmir, the help of a woman who calls herself an International Business Broker
 kya brokar bhi kashmir kaa maamla deal kar rahe hai?maadi sharma 7 aktubar ko european sangh ke saansad kris davis ko email karti hai
 i am writing to Davis that i am organizing this VIP tour so that we can meet Prime Minister Modi
 main aapako aamantrit karte hue khud ko saubhagyashaalee samajhati hum; modi european sangh ke prabhaavshaalee netaaon se milanaa chaahate hai
 Would you like to meet Prime Minister Modi on October 28
 29 aktubar ko kashmir kaa daura hoga or 30 aktubar ko press conference hogi
 The delegation will have leaders from different parties from across Europe
 teen dinon kaa daura hoga
 The ship and stay will be managed by the International Institute of non-elite Studies
 aath aktubar ko maadi sharma kris davis ko phir email karti hai or dhanyavad detii hai ki acha laga ki aapane daure main shaamil hone kii ichha jataai he
 i am coordinating some VIP visits
 mujhe pataa he ki is daure kaa makasad pradhanmantri se milanaa, kashmir janaa or vahaan logon se mukt rup se milanaa he
 After this, on October 10, Madi Sharma again emails Chris Davis
 subject main likhaa he bharat ke liye aamantran, pradhanmantri modi se mulaakaat
 In the letter Madi Sharma has written that Dear Davis, you have expressed your desire to join the mission to meet Prime Minister Modi, thank you for that
 main maafee chaahuungi ki ab or saansadon ko is daure main shaamil nahin kar sakati, isliye guuruuvaar ko tay meeting radd kar rahi hum
 i will try to contact your office when i come from India
 kris davis britain ke north west se european sangh main saansad hai
 He has received the Best Parliamentarian Award twice
 kris davis libral democratic party ke saansad hai
 Chris Davis has claimed that he was not allowed to go to Srinagar when he sought permission to roam freely and talk to anyone without a siege of security teams
 uttar pashchim england se saansad kris davis ne kaha he ki 7 aktubar ko unhen aamantram mila tha, unhone agle hi din jawaab de diya, lekin 10 aktubar ko bataaya gaya ki unhen bulaane kaa prastaav radd ho gaya he
 But another ally of Davis's party has gone to Srinagar
 davis ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki 'main modi sarkaar ke kisi jansampark abhiyaan kaa hissaa banane ke liye taiyaar nahin hum taaki jataayaa ja sake ki sab thik he
 It is very clear that democratic principles have been tampered with in Kashmir and the world should take cognizance of this
 'davis ne kaha ki ve jis kshetra se saansad hai vahaan ke bahut se logon ke sambandh jammu kashmir se hai, jo apane rishtedaaron se baat karnaa chaahate the, unki awaz sunanaa chaahate the jo hone nahin diya gaya
 Davis said that the Women's Economic and Social Think Tank had called her to meet Prime Minister Modi on October 28
 29 aktubar ko jammu or kashmir janaa he
 There will be a press conference on 30 October
 inke aane jane kaa kiraaya International institute for non-aligned Studies' ne diya he
 So two organizations are engaged in this event
 yah sara aayojan jise privet bataaya ja rahaa tha utana bhi privet nahin he kyonki email main likhaa gaya he ki pradhanmantri kis taarikh ko milenge yani pradhanmantri kii sahmati pehle se lee gai hogi, varna unase mulaakaat kii taarikh yun hi tay nahin ho jaati he
 So even though the tour is not official from the European Union, but it feels official from India
 kya aap Women's Economic and Social Think Tank ke bare main jaananaa chahenge ki jo bharat kii videsh niti or wo bhi kashmir ke bare main dakhal dene kii haisiyat rakhti ho
 Now that it has come to light that a third party has visited Kashmir through an NGO, the political consequences of this will depend on how all this information from Hindi newspapers will disappear
 karodon pathakon tak kaise in soochnaaon ko pahunchane se roka jayega
 But what happened that India had to do all this? Till now, India used to react that there is internal matter and such petty movements do not matter
 neuyark main hue sanyukt raashtra sangh kii aamasabha main kashmir ko lekar charchaa se bharat prabhavit nahin hua
 Is India itself moving from Kashmir to internationalization with integrality and internalization or is the issue of Kashmir becoming international despite India not wanting it? Today you must have read the news of this tour in your Hindi newspapers, once again look at the news whether there is any detailed information about these mps and their politics in that news? European Union has 751 seats
 inamen se haal hi main 73 saansadon ne milakar dhur dakshinpanthi dalon kaa ek samooh banaaya he
 Although they have two opinions about proximity to Russia, this group is the fifth largest group in the Parliament of 751 mps
 bharat main isi gut se sambandhit dal or saansad aae hai
 Of the 27 mps, 22 are from the right-wing party
 do saansad centre left dalon ke hai
 The 6 mps from France belong to the National Rally, whose leader is Marine La Pey
 poland se chah saansadon kaa samooh aayaa he jo lau and justise party kaa he
 Four of Britain's five mps are from the right-wing party Brexit Party
 check ganraajya slovakia or italy se aae teen saansad centre rhite ke hai or do saansad centre left ke hai
 One MP is from Germany
 alternative for Germany
 The German news agency was reading details about the party on the site of Deutsche Vella
 yah party ek tarah se isai dharm kii kattarta main yakeen rakhti he
 Believes that there should be no abortion
 ekal parivaar hona chahie
 The press is not allowed to attend his press conference
 agar koi reporter phone karata he to pehle se ricard kiya hua sandesh jawaab ke taur par miltaa he
 Apart from this, alternative for Germany raises the issue of Islam
 tarah tarah ke dar failaati he jise islamophobia kehete hai
 It is believed that refugees who survived the devastation of war and from the torture of their rulers should not be allowed to stay in Germany
 migrant ko koi adhikaar nahin die jane chahie
 Members of the party who hold such an opinion have come to India and have gone to visit Srinagar
 usee tarah yah jaananaa zaruri he ki britain kii party brexit or france kii naishanal raily jaisi partiyon kii niti kya he
 Earlier, the American Senator Chris Van Hollen was not allowed by the Indian government to visit Jammu and Kashmir
 kris dekhne janaa chaahate the ki ghati main kya ho rahaa he
 The National Conference and PDP have called it a PR stunt
 vaise aaj vishwa internet de he or kashmir main 5 agast se internet shatdown he
 14 lakh children have not been to school for three months
 29 taarikh ko jammu kashmir main dasvin ke imtahaan bhi hue
 India's political parties are questioning the permission of European Union mps to visit Srinagar
 jab sipiem netaa seetaram yechuri apni party ke biimaar netaa usoof tarigami ko dekhne janaa chaahate the tab bharat sarkaar ke solisitor general tushaar mehta ne court main virodh kiya tha
 It was said that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is normal, but the visit of Sitaram Yechury will affect the peace
 unka daura raajnneetik he
 The Supreme Court allowed Sitaram Yechury and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad to leave with conditions
 ab vipaksh ke netaa puch rahe hai ki jab unhen nahin jane diya gaya to kis aadhaar par european sangh ke saansadon kaa daura karaayaa ja rahaa he
 Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi tweeted that 'european mps in Kashmir are allowed to walk and intervene, but Indian mps and leaders were sent back from the airport as soon as they arrived
 bada anokhaa rashtrawaad he yah
 'satyapal Malik has now become the Governor of Goa, but when he was the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, he tweeted to Rahul Gandhi that you can come to Kashmir and see the situation but when Rahul Gandhi reached Srinagar, he was returned from the airport itself
 yah ghatana 24 agast kii he
 Not only Rahul Gandhi but 11 opposition leaders were returned
 european union ke 23 saansad srinagar gaye hai
 Then Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi wants the opposition of India to welcome the European Union mps visiting Kashmir
 is daure se jis tarah se europea sangh alag kar rahaa he vah bhi dilachasp he
 The one who discussed Kashmir in Parliament, why is he eager to separate himself from his mp's visit
 aaj uttar pashchim britain se european sangh main saansad theresa griffin ne twit kiya he ki 'yah bilkul saaf ho janaa chahie ki ghur-dakshin panthi saansadon kaa samooh kashmir kaa daura kar rahaa he wo aadhikarik pratinidhimandal nahin he
 They do not represent the European Union
 kashmir main jo shatdown he wo khatm hona chahie or sanvaidhanik shashan phir se behaal hona chahie
 We are deeply concerned about the population of Indian-administered Kashmir which is being denied human rights of many kinds
 ham bharat sarkaar se anurodh karte hai ki un maanavadhikaron ko puri tarah behaal kiya jaae jo unhen nahin die ja rahe hai
 In this tweet of unhumanrights, Indian administered Kashmir is used
 aakhir bharat sarkaar ne in saansadon ko ijazat dekar hasil kya kiya, kahin sarkaar ke is kadam se kashmir kaa maamla antarrashtriya str par or mukhar to nahin ho gaya
 Recently the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the US Parliament was questioning human rights questions in South Asia
 is cameti ke saamne kai log pesh hue the
 Aarti Tikku Singh, a journalist from Times of India, was also present in front of this committee
 jab unhone kaha ki kashmir main 30 saal se jihad chal rahaa he
 Kashmiri Muslims have become victims of Pakistani terror
 is par kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya he tab amareeki congress kii pratinidhi ilhaan umr ne unase kah diya ki aap times of india kii patrkaar hai, jiske pathakon kii sankhya bahut adhik he
 It is your responsibility to present the correct picture
 ilhaan omar ne kaha ki ek reporter kaa kaam hota he satya ke prati objective rahanaa
 Tell your readers exactly what is happening
 main reporter kii majaburiyon ko samajhati hum lekin press tab or bura ho jaataa he jab vah sarkaar kaa bhompu ban jaataa he
 Aarti Tikku described this committee as being prejudiced
 isi cameti ke saamne khud ko kashmiri mul or kashmiri pandit kehane vaali dow
 The speech of Nitasha Kaul was also heard a lot
 nitisha kaul uniwarsity of westoministar main antarrashtriya sambandhon kii associat professor hai
 Nitisha Call had said that there is a human rights crisis in Kashmir
 sawaal yahi he ki kya europea sangh ke saansadon kaa daura bharat kii taraf se kashmir ke masale main teesri party ko aamantran he
 In which way is the issue of alliance between Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad's parties moving in Bihar? Is it not on the same path on which the Janata Parivar car has been catching pace for many days? Paswan's prediction a comment by the Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan that cannot be said to be naïve from anywhere has proved to be the correct prediction
 paswan ne ek meeting main kaha tha, 'agar sau langade mil jaaen, to bhi ve pahalwaan nahin ban sakate hai
 'he said this about the formation of the Janata Parivar
 paswan ke kataaksh ko bihar kii maujuuda siyasat ne hakeekat main badal diya
 Suddenly, one day, Samajwadi Party national general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav appeared and put a brake on the Janata Parivar
 kaha - chunaavon se pehle janata parivaar kaa gathan sambhav nahin he
 The reason? Technical reason
 noummid nahin rahe nitishajanata parivarako lekar shuru se hinithish kumarashwast najar aa rahe the
 That day, after the Janata Durbar was successfully conducted, as soon as the media was confronted with the media, the first match was with the question related to the Janata Parivar

 ) During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit in Bijapur, Chhattisgarh, the state government and administration had deployed 25,000 people here for tight security arrangements, but now their safe return has become a big challenge for the administration
 chhattisgarh kabijapuramein pradhanmantri narendra modi kii yatra ke dauraan sukama se agava hue ek ejeeniyar kii laash jangal se baraamad hui he
 This engineer was working under the supervision of road construction work
 pradhanmantri modi kii yatra ke dauraan sadak nirmaan kaary se judi agenciyon or mazdooron ko naksaliyon ne kaam band karne kii chetavanee di thi
 During this time Naxalikai had reached the area and he opposed the Prime Minister's visit
 unhone graminon ko bhi chetavanee di thi ki ve yadi is kaarykram main shaamil hue yaa phir pradhanmantri kii aamasabha main, to unhen iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna hoga
 It is said that on Saturday, the engineer of a road construction company T
 kaasalu kaa naksaliyon ne apharan kar liya tha
 He was captured by the Naxalites for two days
 somvaar kii dopaher dharmpanta or fidagudam ke jangal ke bichombich sthit kasaram naale ke paas ek shav laavaaris haalat main police ko mili
 Naxalites had strangled this engineer with a sharp weapon
 police ke mutabik shanivaar kii subah is ejeeniyar ko kistaram ke jangal ke us hisse se agava kiya gaya tha, jahaan sadak nirmaan kaa kaary chal rahaa tha
 The workers had informed the Naxalites to come there and take Kaslu with them at gunpoint
 police ke mutabik is soochna ke baad kaasalu kii khojbin bhi kii gai thi, lekin koi jaankaree nahin mili
 The staff of Kistaram police station reached the spot
 graminon se shav kii shinaakht karai gai
 It was then discovered that the deceased's name is Kaslu, who is working in a private agency involved in road construction
 police ne shav apane kabje main lekar use postmortem ke liye bhej diya he
 Meanwhile, during the Bijapur visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, safe dispatch of about 25 thousand government employees sent to Bastar remains a problem for the government
 pradhanmantri ke kaarykram main hissaa lene ke chalate police or suraksha balon ke karmchaaree hi nahin balki vibhinn vibhaagon ke sarkari karmchaaree bhi naksaliyon ke nishane par aa gaye hai
 Jangla of Bijapur where the Prime Minister's program was held
 us ilaake main pulicekarmiyon or afasaron samet lagbhag 25 hajaar sarkari kamarchaariyon kii tainaati kii gai thi
 Most of the officers and employees are employed in PWD, Irrigation, Tribal Development Department, Health, Anganwadi Women and Child Development, Public Relations, Electricity Department, Forest Department, and Panchayat Department
 sabhi afasar or karmchaaree raipur or bastar sambhag se bijapur bheje gaye the
 After the end of the Prime Minister's visit, the government and police departments have to work hard to get them safely to their destinations
 in ilaakon se logon ko surakshit nikaalnaa prashasan ke liye badi chunauti sabit ho rahaa he
 According to Inspector General of Police of Bastar Range, Vivekananda Sinha, the departure of police and central security forces has started
 tamaam bal apane baiyrakon main pahunchane laga he
 He said that on all the routes connected to Bijapur, police and central security forces have taken a round the clock so that all the personnel involved in the Prime Minister's visit can reach their homes safely
 sansad main gahamagahami ke bich do chijen central haul main charchaa main raheen
 The first is why Sushma Swaraj removed the foreign minister from her Twitter handle
 log is par fusfusa rahe the ki kahin unki chuttee to nahin ho rahi yaa phir unhone khud istipha to nahin de diya
 This was also happening because Sushma Swaraj is not sitting in her assigned room these days
 unhen netaa pratipaksh kaa cameraa diya gaya he
 But the truth is that there was a smell in the old room of Sushma Swaraj and they demanded a new room
 chunki is vakt koi netaa pratipaksh nahin he or unka cameraa khaali he or vahi sushamaa swaraj ko de diya gaya or shaam hote tak sushamaa swaraj ke twitor handle par videsh mantri hone kaa zikr bhi aa gaya
 The second thing that was discussed in the Central Hall was the scolding of Sonia Gandhi to Shashi Tharoor
 darasal, shashi tharur kaa ek bayaan aa gaya tha ki congress ko sansad chalane dena chahie, sansad baadhit karne se party kii chhavi par asar padegaa
 Sonia Gandhi rebuked Tharoor in an internal meeting of the party which was taking place before the House began, that you should not do this, you have already done this
 sonia gusse main thi kyonki kuch saansadon ne sonia ko tharur ke bare main shikaayat kii thi ki wo party anushaasan ke khilaaf chale jate hai
 After this scolding, Rahul Gandhi handled the situation and went to the Lok Sabha with the mps
 duusari baat jo central haul main charchaa main rahi wo tha shashi tharur ko sonia gandhi kii daant
 Actually, a statement by Shashi Tharoor had come that Congress should be allowed to run the Parliament, disrupting Parliament will affect the image of the party
 sonia gandhi ne tharur ko party kii ek andruni meeting jo sadan shuru hone se pehle ho rahi thi, main sabake saamne danta ki aap aisa na kiya karen, aap pehle bhi aisa kar chuke hai
 Sonia was furious as some mps complained to Sonia about Tharoor that they go against party discipline
 is daant ke baad rahul gandhi ne halaat ko sambhala or saansadon ko lekar lok sabha main chale gaye

 ho saktaa he puri duniya ke logon ko ek din plastic se hone vaale pradooshan se chhutkaaraa mil jaaya
 Plastic is the waste that causes the most pollution
 ise khatm karne ke liye aaj bhi vaigyanikon ke paas koi safal formula nahin he
 Now scientists have discovered an organism that can break the chemical bonds present in plastic
 vaigyanikon ne jaankaree di he ki, ek commercial rup se viksit caterpillarpolithin bagsko jaldi se tod saktaa he, jisase mitti or samudron main jamaa ho rahe plastic se chhutkaaraa paaya ja saktaa he
 This study was published in the journal Current Biology
 euke ke cambridge uniwarsity ke vaigyanikon ne ek aise jeev kii pahchaan kii jo madhumakhi kaa chhatta kha saktaa he or yahi jeev plastic ko bhi kha saktaa he
 When the scientists left the organism on a plastic bag for a while, it was found that after 40 minutes, holes in the bag began to appear and 12 hours later the mass of the plastic was reduced by 92 milligrams
 vaigyaanakon ne ek spekatroscopy analysis jariye dikhaaya ki ye jeev kis tarah plastic main maujuud chemical bond ko tod rahe hai
 In this analysis, it was reported that these organisms converted polyethylene into ethylene glycol
 isse is baat ko sabit kiya gaya ki ye jeev keval plastic ko khate nahin he balki unhen transform kar dete hai
 Bombayli, a scientist associated with the research, says that the speed of degradation of plastics by these organisms is much faster than a recently discovered bacterium, which 0
 13 mg pratidinaki gati se plastic ko nasht karata tha
 Bombelli also believes that if only one organism is involved in this chemical process, its reproduction will be done on a large scale through biotechnological methods

 shuukravaar agar 13 taarikh ko ho to use ashubh mana jaataa he
 This recognition is not particularly in India, but in Western countries
 aapako bataa den ki 13 ko lekar ek khaas dar kuch logon main hota he
 In Western countries, many hotels do not have room number-13 due to this, whereas the 13th floor is not kept in many tall buildings
 yani 12wein ke baar sidhe 14waan number rakhaa jaataa he
 This superstition is known by a particular word in English, which is paraskevidekatriaphobia
 ek report ke mutabik, 13 ko lekar dar itnaa he ki is din kai log flite se travel karnaa pasand nahin karte
 This makes airfares cheaper on this day
 haalanki, 13 ke ashubh hone ke peeche jad bahut puraani he
 It is mentioned in the Bible
 duusari ore, shuukravaar ko bhi ashubh maanate hai
 Because of this, 13 more Fridays together turn into a scary ominous day
 jisas ko shuukravaar ko hi suuli par chadhaaya gaya tha
 There is also a connection with the Friday of the 13th that there was a major accident in France on 13 October 1307
 ek british website ke mutabik, england ke ek medical jarnal main ek study prakashit hui thi
 In this 1993 study, it was reported that accidents have increased on Friday the 13th

 The average category burning incidence in terms of all city pollution except Jalandhar is 8 as compared to last year
 7 fisadi kampunjab fasal avshesh jalaane ke maamle main deshbhar kaa centre he
 But this state has a very satisfactory performance in terms of Air Quality Index (AQI)
 vahiin iske padosi dilli-ensiaar, haryana or uttar pradesh ke kai hisson main vaayu pradooshan kaa str bad rahaa he
 As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, on November 7, all the cities except Jalandhar in Punjab are in satisfactory condition with average category in terms of pollution
 yahaan akyuai kaa str amritsar main (154), bathinda (102), khanna (89), ludhiana (142), mandi gobindgarh (119) or patiala main 66 rahaa
 AQI level of Jalandhar city was recorded at 217, only in Jalandhar city, AQI level was recorded at 217, which is considered as poor category
 punjab va haryana kii sanyukt rajdhani chandigarh main bhi akyuai santoshjanak shrenee ke saath 86 darj kiya gaya
 In all these cities of Punjab, the work like burning of parali (crop residue) is done on a large scale, but in terms of pollution, the climate here is relatively correct in neighboring states
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki paraali se uthne vaala dhuaan kai baar uttar pashchimi hawaaon ke saath yahaan se nikal jaataa he
 Most burning incidents have been reported in Punjab
 krishi mantralay ke aankadon ke anusaar, chaalu varsh main yahaan fasal avshesh jalaane kii 25,366 ghatnaayen hui hai, jo pichley saal 27,584 kii tulana main 8

 Hence the level of air pollution increases rapidly
 iske baad vaataavaran saaf hone main kaaphi samay lagata he, kyonki isaki khud ko saaf karne kii kshamta kam ho jaati he
 The reason for this is that the region is a closed land area with the Himalayas, Aravalli and Vindhya mountain ranges
 'congress netaa jyotiraditya sindhiya ne ek haalia twit main kaha, 'satellite tasveeron se pataa chalata he ki ganga kaa maidan, jahaan hamaare desh kii lagbhag aadhi aabaadi rahati he, vahaan sabhi jahrili gas ke chembar main band hai

 This TV actor got work in Bollywood, Nazarvivek will come with Shahid's sister, in this interview, he also explained why he disarmed Maldives
 unhone kaha, "hamaari haal main hi shaadi hui he isliye main or divyanka saath main kuch vakt bitaana chaahate the or duniya ghoomana chaahate the
 So we are trying to fit it in our busy schedule

 Big offer to Sabyasachi Satpathy, will be seen in the role of 'gay' in the web show Talking about the work front, Divyanka is busy shooting her show Yeh Hai Mohabbatein these days, while Vivek Dahiya is busy shooting for the show of Qayamat Ki Raat
 is horer sho main karishma tanna bhi ahm kirdaar main hai
 Apocalypse Night is performing well in terms of trps as the show has entered the top 10 in the BARC list within a few days of its launch
 aaj jab bazaar kii disha main anischitata chai he to share bazaar ke niveshkon ko aise sheyaron main nivesh karnaa chahie, jisamen laabh kii spasht sambhaavna dikhti ho
 a conversation with Anil Das, who sold tea on the roadside in Noida's industrial township, indicated the best opportunity to invest in the tea industry
 anil ne bataaya ki garmi kaa mausam hone ke kaaran chaay kii bikri chavanni ghat gai he or kuch dinon main bikri aadhi ho jaaegi
 Summer has started and Anil Das has said that ordinary sales have come down by 25 per cent, that is, 75 per cent and in the coming days, when the heat will increase, it will be reduced to 50 per cent
 lagbhag puure bharat main march ke baad se garmi ke mausam kii shuruyaat ho jaati he or is dauraan sheethal peyon kii bikri bad jaati he
 Therefore, tea sales decrease in this proportion
 isliye chaay se sambandhit companiyon ko laabh bhi is mausam main kam hota he
 But with the onset of rain and then cold, it can be easily guessed that tea once again starts heating up in the market
 yani jab mausam garm ho to chaay or coffee udyog thanda rahata he or in sheyaron ke nichle str par rahane kii bhi sambhaavna bani rahati he
 Conversely, if the weather is cold, the tea-coffee industry is hot and accordingly there is a possibility of a rise in these stocks
 lihaaja garmiyon main hi chaay or coffee se sambandhit kuch achche fundamental vaali companiyon main nivesh kar kareeb 6 maheene ke lakshya ke saath sabar kiya jaae, to fal meetha mil saktaa he
 Assam Company (india) Limited, Bombay Burma Trading Corporation Limited, Harrisons Malayalam Limited, Jayashree Tea & Industry Limited, mcleod Russell (india Limited) and Tata Global Beverages are the major tea industry companies listed on the stock exchange, whose shares are valued these days
 Is quite low
 chaay board ke aankadon se pataa chalata he ki sheet ritu main purvi or purvottar kshetra main chaay ke paudhe suptavastha main hote hai or isliye janvari, farvari or march maheene main utpaadan kaaphi ghat jaataa he
 Therefore, the total auction of tea in the country also decreases
 chaay board ke salaahkaar kaala ne kaha ki chaay ko kam utpaadan vaali avadhi main nilaamee ke liye surakshit rakhana kaarobaar ke liye phydemand nahin he, kyonki isse uski gunvattta kharaab ho jaati he
 Hence it has to be sold immediately after production
 kaala ne bataaya ki barish ke dinon main chaay kaa saamaanya utpaadan hota he
 Therefore, its auction is also more on rainy days
 chaay board ke aankadon ke mutabik desh main janvari se april maheene kii avadhi main aam taur par chaay kaa utpaadan saal bhar main sabase kam hota he
 According to the board's website, Assam Valley and Cachar in India and Duars, Terai and Darjeeling in West Bengal are the major areas of tea plantations
 jabaki dakshin bharat main tamilnadu, kerala or karnataka chaay utpaadan ke pramukh kshetra hai
 As far as exports are concerned, according to the data available on the board's website, north and south India has the highest exports of tea from July to December i
e
 the second and third quarter of the business year
 chaay kii keemton ke morche par bhi dekhen, to board ke aankadon ke mutabik uttar or dakshin bharat donon jagah nilaamee main janvari se march maheene main keemat sabase kam rahati he
 Whereas in April to December i
e
 the first, second and third quarter the price is generally higher
 khaas kar duusari timahi main yah sabase adhik rahati he
 Overall, the fourth quarter of the business year is a month of sluggish business for tea producers
 upabhoktaaon ko chaay bechney vaali companiyon ke liye haalanki kaarobaari saal kii pehali timahi (april-june) sust avadhi hoti he
 Rajesh Sharma, officer of Tetley Consumer Care of Tata Global Beverages Ltd
, the country's leading tea company, confirmed that tea sales in the summer months of April to June declined
 unhone kaha, 'garmi ke kaaran graahakon ke bich sheethal peyon kii khapat bad jaati he or chaay kii khapat ghat jaati he, jabaki thand ke maheene main chaay kii khapat bad jaati he
 Talking about the difference between sales in summer and winter, he said that sales increase by 20 per cent in the cold season compared to summer
 lihaaja chote kaarobaari yadi chaay utpaadak companiyon ke sheyaron main janvari se march ke bich or upabhoktaaon ko chaay bechney vaali companiyon ke sheyaron main april se june ke bich nivesh karen or kareeb chah maheene tak dhiraj rakhen to unhen behatar munaafe ke rup main mithe fal khaane ko mil sakate hai

 Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati once again targeted the BJP over demonetisation
 mayawati ne kaha ki centre main sarkaar banane ke baad bijepi apane vaadon kaa ek-chauthai bhi puraa nahin kar pai he
 The decision of demonetisation was taken in haste and now it has become a sore throat for them
 apane chor daravaaje se bijepi ne puunjipatiyon or dhannasethon kaa bahut paisa bahaya he
 Mayawati said that in Uttar Pradesh, the alliance of SP and Congress is being done at the behest of BJP
 congress-samaajawaadee party kaa gathbandhan tabhi hoga, jab bijepi ko phayda hoga
 bjp's defeat in UP assembly elections is certain
 bijepi ne apane paksh main hawa banane ke liye kuch swaarthee logon ko todakar apni party main shaamil kiya or iskaa khub prachaar karavaaya
 The BSP supremo said that even after adopting various abusive tactics and rallying the rally, desperation has been found in the BJP to create mass support

 Mayawati said that Samajwadi Party and BJP are behind the riots in UP
 unhone muslimon ko aagaah karte hue kaha ki bijepi or anya partiyaan muslim voton ko baantne kii chaal chal rahi hai

 Imran admitted that Kashmir will not benefit from raising the issue in the UN
 It will be acceptable to the American press that the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan has to address the United Nations today
 apane sambodhan se pehle unhone ek baar phir kashmir kaa raag alapa he or kaha ki vah sirf jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa uthaane ke liye hi yahaan par aae hai
 But even before the address, Imran has given up arms and said that he knows it is not going to help
 neuyork times ke editors se baat karte hue pakistani pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘mujhe pataa he ki sanyukt raashtra main mere jammu-kashmir par bhaashan se kuch bada asar nahin hoga, khaskar aane vaale dinon main
 
 
 But he wants the world to hear the issue of Jammu and Kashmir
 ’imran khan ke bayaan se saaf he ki vah sanyukt raashtra ke manch par kashmir kaa masalaa to jarur uthaaenge, lekin unhen isse koi ummid nazar nahin aati he
 It is worth noting that even before this, wherever Imran Khan has raised the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, he has been defeated
 imran khan ne yahaan par kaha ki bharat ne jammu-kashmir ke liye jo faisla liya he wo niyamon ke khilaaf he or unhen is baat kaa andaja nahin tha ki iskaa virodh bhi ho saktaa he
 If the United Nations does not intervene in this matter, then who will give it? Let me tell you that the Prime Minister of Pakistan had raised this issue in front of US President Donald Trump earlier, but to no avail
 donald trump ne kashmir ke masale par madhyasthata kii baat to kahi he lekin saath hi ye bhi kaha he ki aisa tabhi ho saktaa he jab bharat isapar raji hoga
 But India has also made it clear that this is a bilateral issue and will talk to Pakistan only if it wants to talk about terrorism
 sanyukt raashtra main kab he imran kaa bhaashan?bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi aaj raat 8 baje sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ko sambodhitakarenge
 Imran Khan's address is only after PM Modi's speech, if Imran raises the issue of Kashmir and accuses India, then representatives from India will respond to the allegations
 uttarakhand main sailaab ke sitam ke baad lagaataar barish se ab bhagirathi bhi ufaan par he
 The water level of the river is continuously increasing
 prashasan ne bhagirathi ke kinare based sabhi logon ko pehle se hi alert kar diya he
 Meanwhile, demand has been raised to install state-of-the-art prediction systems including Dappler radar in the hill states following the death and death of hundreds of people in Uttarakhand due to rain and cloudburst incidents
 badal fatne, tufaan, chakravaat or barish jaisi aapadaaon ke bare main sateek bhavishyavaanee ke liye desh ke vibhinn hisson main 14 dapler radar lagaaye gaye lekin uttarakhand main abhi tak ek bhi dapler radar sthapit nahin kiya gaya he
 There are allegations from many sections that when cloudburst and other natural phenomena are seen more in mountainous states like Uttarakhand, then why Dappler radars were not installed here under the first phase while the plains were preferred

 dilli bijepi main emsidi chunaav se pehle sabakuch thik nahin lag rahaa
 This is because ever since becoming the new state president, leaders of different factions are competing to establish their supremacy in the party
 manoj tiwari ke adhyaksh banane ke baad se hi ye hode shuru ho gai thi
 It is believed that he is new to Delhi in terms of organization and is not aware of the internal politics of the party
 taaja maamla tiwari kii gairmaujuudagi main emsidi chunaav ke ummidavaaron ke intervyuu karne ke liye alag se kor cameti banane ko lekar he
 After which angry Tiwari has now called a meeting of the party's core committee
 pehle 26 farvari ko hone vaali baithak ab aanan fanan main 22 farvari ko hi bula lee gai he
 According to sources, Tiwari is angry about forming a parallel core committee and in the midst of the UP election campaign, coming to Delhi, he is trying to realize his power within the party
 vidhansabha chunaav main haarane ke baad hui thi niyuktibijapi hai kaman ne manoj tiwari ko dilli kaa adhyaksh isliye banaaya tha ki vidhansabha main mili karaari haar ke baad party main nai jaan foonki ja sake
 The BJP, divided into different camps, could get an equal leadership
 jabaki manoj tiwari ke adhyaksh banane ke baad dilli bijepi ke bheetar hi nae sameekaran banane lage hai
 Manoj says something else Manoj Tiwari says that the core committee of the party is already decided
 isamen sabhi saansad or purv adhyaksh sammilit hai
 Along with this, Manoj Tiwari has also said that there is no separate committee for MCD elections
 isi ke baad is baat ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki tiwari dilli bijepi ke prabharee shyaam jaju kii dakhlandaji se naaraaz hai
 According to party insiders, Shyam Jaju is not only taking a meeting of party leaders in his absence, but balkimcd is also showing great interest in tickets for elections
 aaj kii baithak main bijepi ke bade netaa or janpratinidhi hongebuudhvaar (aaj) hone vaali baithak main dilli ke sabhi saansadon ke saath dilli bijepi ke teenon mahaamantri or dilli vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ko bulaayaa gaya he
 It is believed that Tiwari wants to convey this message from within the party that he is not a dummy president
 aise main ab tiwari bhale hi sandesh dene main kaamyaab ho bhi jaaen lekin ain emsidi chunaav ke pehle bijepi ke bheetar shuru hui uthapatak kahin party kii chunavi naiya na duubo de
 Team India lost the ODI series 2–1 on the Bangladesh tour
 aakhri match kii jeet cricket phans ko kuch tasalli to de gai lekin kuch aise bade sawaal jahan main chhod gai jiskaa jawaab aane vaale kuch dinon main shaayad mil jaae
 All is not well in the team and it was seen during the ODI series
 bangladesh ne shandaar cricket khelaa ismenkoi shaq nahin lekin is baat se bhi inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki team india ne apni galatiyon kii vajah seyah siries ganvaai
 There were five major reasons for the defeat of Team India - 1- The first match of the foot-series in the team showed lack of coordination between the players
 team india ke captain kool mahendra singh dhoni or viraat kohli donon ne ishaaron main dressing room ke maahaul sahi nahin hone kii baat kahi
 Kohli said before the third ODI that some decisions were not taken with confidence due to which the team was harmed
 vahiin dhoni ne duusare vanade ke baad kaha tha ki meri pareshaani captaini nahin dressing room kaa maahaul he
 2- Virat Kohli's irresponsible batting- Virat Kohli did not bat properly in the entire series
 viraat is siries ke dauraan kaaphi charchaa main rahe
 In the first, second and last ODI, he had more contribution than the bowler in the dismissal of Virat
 iske alaava duusare vanade match main viraat ek free hit gend par defensive shot khelte najar aae
 In such a situation, the role of Virat was quite big in this defeat
 3- team combination-dhoni ek aise captain hai jinhen plaing ilevan se chhedchhad karnaa kam hi bhaataa he
 Every match in this series saw a change in the playing eleven
 pehle match main ajinkya rahane the to duusare main unki jagah ambati raidu aae
 Two changes were made in the playing eleven in the third and final match as well
 aakhri match main ravindra jadeja or bhubaneshwar kumaar ko plaing ilevan se hataaya gaya
 4- 'mathapachhi' on fast bowling - Team India was upset with their fast bowlers during the entire series
 mohit sharma, bhubaneshwar kumaar, umesh yadav or stuart binni sabane dhoni kaa sirdard badhaayaa
 Dhawal Kulkarni was successful to some extent but he too could not do much special
 tej gendbaaji dhoni kaa itnaa bada sirdard ban chuki he ki unhone aakhri match ke baad kaha ki ab is baat par faisla lene kaa samay aa gaya he ki hamen tej gendbaaj chahie yaa achche
 The fast bowlers proved to be quite expensive throughout the series
 5- bedam ballebaaji-aakhri match ko chhod den to pehle ke donon match main team india kii ballebaaji ausat darje se bhi gai gujri rahi
 Barring Dhoni and Shikhar Dhawan, none of the batsmen could do anything special

 About six months before the election in Tripura, a senior leader of the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura (IPFT) was going through a personal crisis — his son had a heart ailment and needed a lot of money for treatment
 assam ke vitt mantri hemanth biswa sarama us samay bhaajapa ke prachaar abhiyaan kii taiyaari ke silsile main rajya kii yatra par the
 He came to know about the IPFT leader's crisis
 haalanki ve us netaa ko nijee taur par nahin jaanate the, lekin sarama ne jane-maane hridayrog visheshgy dow
 Devi Shetty called and arranged for free treatment of the child at Narayana Hrudayalaya in Guwahati
 bachche kaa safaltaapurvak ilaaj ho gaya or sarama ko jindagibhar ke liye ek dost mil gaya
 In January this year, when Sarma was weaving a nexus between the BJP and the IPFT (despite opposition from senior leaders on both sides), his new friend at the IPFT played a key role in implementing it
 us samay tak vah ek naammumkin-sa kaam lagata tha
 The IPFT was demanding a separate "switzerland" state for the tribes while the BJP was against any division of the state
 sarama kehete hai, ''antaravirodhon ko prabandhit karnaa hi raajnneeti he
 "sarma prepared the IPFT to give up this demand before the elections
 chunaavon ke nattejey aane ke baad ipift ne is maang ko phir se ched diya, haalanki sarama isse jaraa bhi vichlit nahin hai
 "we have an alliance with the Bodoland People's Front (BPF) in Assam for two years," he says
 ve bhi alag bodoland rajya kii maang karte rahe hai
 All such issues can be resolved through dialogue
 "rajya main 20 janajaatiy-bahul siton main bhaajapa-ipift gathbandhan bahut ahm rahaa
 The IPFT contested nine seats there and won eight and the BJP ten
 is tarah unhone vam dalon kaa unke garh se hi safaya kar diya
 Prof
 Nanny Gopal Mahanta at Guwahati University says, "it is the flag bearers of the bjp's" regionalization "politics in the Northeast, in which they are forming multi-party alliances with regional parties with a cooperative and competitive structure
 yah model sabase pehle assam main kargar rahaa
 This model is now reaching new heights with his personal network
 "sarama kii chunavi raajnneeti kii khaas baat adngon kaa pehle hi andaja karke unhen roak dena he
 a year before the Tripura election on February 18, Sarma realized that anti-cpi votes were divided
 kai congressi netaa pehle hi unke sampark main the, jinamein ve bhi shaamil the jo tripura main trinmul congress ke saath ja mili the
 However, bjp's Tripura in-charge Sunil Deodhar and state president Biplav Deb were against his inclusion in the party
 sarama ne thodaa vakt lekar intjaar kiya or phir july, 2017 main raashtrapati chunaav se pehle unhen iskaa mauka mila
 BJP candidate Ram Nath Kovid needed the support of TMC members in Tripura to face the challenge from the united opposition
 party pramukh amit shah kii rajamandi se guwahati main ek samjhauta kiya gaya ki ve log chunaav main kovid kaa samarthan karenge or baad main bhaajapa unhen party main shaamil kar legi
 In August, six TMC mlas — Sudeep Roy Burman, Ashish Saha, Pranjit S
 roy, diba chandra harankhwal, dilip sarkaar or biswa bandhu sen bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaye
 Sarma's guess proved to be correct when he won the election by six major differences
 lekin tripura main badi jang janajatiyon kaa samarthan hasil karne kii thi
 The CPI (M) had been winning 20 reserved tribal seats for years
 isaki vajah vam-virdohi maton kaa congress or anya janajaatiy partiyon main vibhaajan tha
 Due to his past in the Congress, Sarma knew many party leaders and had pledged support for him from behind the scenes
 lekin janajaatiy partiyon ko saath lekar gathbandhan bananaa badi chunauti thi
 Tribals influence 36 seats (including 20 reserved seats) out of 60 seats in Tripura Assembly
 iske alaava devdhar or deb kii jodi bhi janajaatiy partiyon ke saath gathbandhan ke khilaaf thi kyonki use isse prabhutvshaalee bengali vot chhitakane kaa dar tha
 Nevertheless Sarma forged an alliance with the IPFT
 ise amali jama pehanaane ke liye unhone guwahati ke taj vivanta main ipift netaaon ke saath raat-raat bhar chali do baithken kii
 He was then head of IPFT, N
 si
 He went to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh regarding Debabrahma
 iske alaava unhone rajeshwar debabrahma ke netritv vaale ipift ke dhade ko bhaajapa ke saath vilay karne ke liye bhi raji kara liya
 The work of the ruling trio did not stop until forming an alliance
 bhaajapa adhyaksh amit shah ne (ek aantarik survey ke baad) unhen 10 ''mahatvapurn" chunaav kshetron kii ek suchi thamai
 Sarma then sent ten of his special people — including ministers, legislators and party workers — to these constituencies from Assam and kept them there until the day of the election
 party ne guwahati main ek chartered vimaan ko hameshaa taiyaar rakhaa taaki ve khud jarurat padane par turant kahin bhi aa-ja saken
 Much of the NAPA-TULA ground work and the bjp's heavy electoral machinery, both of which were a big reason for Sarma's confidence on the polling day
 unhone us din savere india today se kaha tha, ''hamaara pehla lakshya 34 siten hai
 Then it can go up to 45
 " nateezon main bhaajapa ko 35 or ipift ko aath siten milin
 Thanks to this politics of managing personal relationships and electoral arithmetic, this former Congress leader (he joined BJP in July 2015) has almost single-handedly colored the entire Northeast in less than three years
 
 meghalaya kaa ganitsaramaa jab 3 march ko tripura kii jeet ke swaad kaa lutf le rahe the, to unhen party pramukh amit shah kaa ghabrahat bharaa phone aayaa
 The Congress had sent veteran party leaders Kamal Nath and Ahmed Patel to Meghalaya to form a coalition government under the leadership of the Congress in the state
 saath sadasyon vaali vidhansabha ke nateezon main congress 21 siton ke saath sabase badi party bani thi
 bjp's National People's Party won 19 seats and BJP only two, although no agreement was reached between them before the election
 sarkaar banane ke liye unhen united democratic party (udipi), hills state piples democratic party (echespidipi), piples democratic front (peedief) or nirdaleeyon ke samarthan kii jarurat thi or ye sab kisi bhi palade main ja sakate the
 On the way to the chartered flight, there were no signs of tension on Sarma's face
 ve ek asamiya film ke geet kii dhun par siti baja rahe the jisamen unhone bal abhinayta ke taur par kaam kiya tha—ek duii tini chaari, juty dilu garu gaari (ek do teen chaar, meri baiylgaadee hui shuru)
 They knew that they were on the right track because they had won this battle many months earlier when they sat with the leaders of fellow parties of the NDA — UDP, HSPDP and PDF
 isai-bahul meghalaya main bhaajapa ke liye chunaav-purv saathi dhund paanaa mushkil tha kyonki vahaan party ke hindutv agenda or ''bif" raajnneeti ke khilaaf tagada virodh najar aa rahaa tha
 But all parties agreed to an unofficial settlement, as it seems a more practical approach to join hands with the ruling party at the Center for a state that relies largely on the Centre's grant for its revenue
 sarama ko isamen madad mili congress ke mukhyamantri mukul sangama ke khilaaf ek sajhi hikaarat ke bhav se
 UDP executive chairman Paul Lyngdoh told India Today on January 29, "there is a consensus among the regional parties to overthrow the Mukul Sangma government
" "udhar, bhaajapa netritv enpipi ke adhyaksh conrad sangama par chunaav purv gathjod karne ke liye dabaav daal rahaa tha
 Konrad knew that such an alliance could be suicidal for his party
 enpipi ke ek netaa kaa kahana tha, ''agar chunaav-purv gathjod ho gaya hota to congress ne chunaav main sabakaa safaya kar diya hota
 "konrad says," We did not have any alliance in Manipur and Nagaland even before the elections
 " us samay sarama ne dakhal dekar apni party ke varisht netaaon se kaha ki ve enpipi ko jaraa alag chhod den
 So while the rest of the BJP leaders continued to campaign for the party, Sarma and his team from Assam continued to offer help to all the other parties through the NDA and the bjp-led north-east Democratic Alliance (NEDA)
 jab sarama se poocha gaya ki kya enpipi or anya dalon ko vittiya samarthan uplabdh karaayaa gaya tha to unhone kaha, ''madad kaa matlab har samay dhan nahin hota
 All these leaders are my friends and we contested in a friendly atmosphere
 " unhone koi cheez baad ke liye nahin chodi
 Long before Patel and Nath landed in Shillong, Sarma's partner Manab Deka was sitting with UDP president Donkupar Roy at his house and taking a cup of tea
 unke ek anya saathi or assam ke vidhayak pijush hajarika nirdaleey vidhayak samual sangama ke saath guwahati ke taj hotel main jame hue the
 When he reached Shillong in the evening, his mathematics was confirmed
 meghalaya ke nae mukhyamantri conrad sangama kehete hai, ''himanta da main kuch khaas baat to he
 "guwahati-based political analyst Dilip Chandan says," Many people have accused him of using money power to prepare legislators to join hands with the BJP
 lekin sawaal sirf dhan kaa nahin he
 Many leaders have a lot of money in this area
 lekin unke paas logon ko rajamand karne kii jabardast kaabiliyat he
 "between 2015 and 2016, the saffron party in Arunachal had faced embarrassment over the BJP high command's attempt to oust the 44-seat Congress government in the 60-member assembly
 supreme court ne aadesh main congress sarkaar ko phir se behaal kar diya tha or party ne tatkaaleen mukhyamantri nabam tuki kii jagah vidrohi gut ke netaa pema khandu ko laakar apane andruni sankat ko lagbhag sulajhaa liya tha
 After this, Shah once again went to Sarma and asked him to persuade Khandu to join the BJP
 khandu ke saath sarama ke puraane sambandh rahe hai kyonki donon ek hi party main rahe the
 After several meetings with Khandu in Itanagar and Guwahati, Sarma persuaded him to come to an agreement — on 16 September 2016, Khandu left the Congress and joined the Peoples Party of Arunachal (PPA), a small party with 43 mlas Which was part of NEDA
 isse yah tay ho gaya ki yadi koi gadabadi hoti he to bhaajapa par iljaam nahin lagegaa
 But the crisis arose because the Congress was almost successful in persuading Khandu to bring him back
 29 disambar ko khandu or chah anya vidhayakon ko party virdohi gatividhiyon ke kaaran pipie se barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Khandu met party leaders in Delhi and preparations were made for his return to the party
 arunachal ke mukhyamantri dilli se guwahati hote hue itanagar laut rahe the ki sarama ne assam ke tejpur main unhen roak liya or shah or madhav se phone par unki baat kara di
 On October 31, Khandu joined the BJP with 33 mlas
 mishan manipurcongress 11 march, 2017 ko manipur kii 60-sadasyeey vidhansabha main 28 siton ke saath sabase badi party bani thi jabaki bhaajapa ko 21 siten hi mili thim
 It was not difficult for the Congress to get the support of the three mlas but Sarma again came forward as a snag
 usee din sarama ke sahyogiyon ne congress ke do vidhayakon tii
 Shyam Kumar and G
 insuanahaavo jaavo, tiemasi ke vidhayak tii
 Ravindra Singh and the only independent MLA, Ashab Uddin, were secretly summoned and lodged at the Taj Vivanto Hotel
 do din baad ve sabhi bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaye
 The bjp-led alliance with NDA partners NPF, NPP and LJP has 34 mlas which is a sufficient number to form the government
 lekin sarama sunishchit karnaa chaahate the ki aage chalakar enpief jaise dhulmul sahyogi sarkaar ke liye koi samasya na khadi kar den, isliye ve congress vidhayakon par dore daalate rahe
 Finally, in July 2017, 10 Congress mlas joined BJP and the party single-handedly won an absolute majority
 sarama kehete hai, ''congress main rahane ke kaaran mujhe yah sab karne main sahaayta mili kyonki 2012 main main manipur chunaavon kaa prabharee tha
 i have always had good relations with former colleagues
 "sankat ko pehle se hi bhaanp lene kii unki kaabiliyat march 2018 main nagaland main sarkaar ke gathan ke dauraan bahut kaam ai
 Before the elections in Nagaland on 27 February, the BJP had left its ally NPF with no agreement on seat sharing
 bhagava party ne purv mukhyamantri nifu rio ke netritv vaali andipeepi ke saath chunaav-purv gathbandhan kar liya tha
 Rio split from the NPF in January
 enpief ko 27 siten milin or bhaajapa-andipeepi ko 28 siton par jeet mili
 With the support of nda's ally NPP and JD (U), the coalition had 31 mlas, enough to form the government
 lekin nivartmaan mukhyamantri tii
 R
 jiliang ne yah kahkar istipha dene se inkaar kar diya ki bhaajapa ko enpief ko samarthan dena hoga varanaa vah manipur main bhaajapa sarkaar se samarthan waapas le legi
 Although the withdrawal of the APF will not affect the Manipur government but Sarma did not want to take any risk
 5 march ko ve guwahati ke radison blue hotel main apane ''puraane mitra" jiliang se mili or unhen istipha dene ke liye raji kar liya
 Now only Mizoram is outside the jurisdiction of BJP
 yahaan disambar main chunaav hone hai
 For Sarma, this may prove to be the toughest battleground as the Congress is in a strong position in the Christian-majority state led by Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla
 yahaan bhaajapa kaa janaadhar nahin he
 So will his dream of making the Northeast free of Congress remain unfulfilled as a revenge for Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who has turned down the demand of replacing him with Tarun Gogoi in Assam
 sarama kehete hai, ''assam main badla hi mukhya kaaran tha
 But now i have moved on by forgetting it
 chahta hum ki mere kaam kaa sammaan kiya jaae jo mujhe bhaajapa main bharpoor mil rahaa he
 "*** ankhon par pattee bandhe or hathkadi main jakade falstini kaidiyon ke bagal main khadi israeli kii mahila sainik kii tasviir ne isroyal main hangaamaa khadaa kar diya he or swatantra samoohon ne ise ‘amanviya’ bataaya he

 The party is also angry with these mps

 ' kya ye line ab team india ke visphotak ballebaaj virendra sahvaag par sateek baithne laga he? kya team india main ab viru kii vaapasi ke daravaaje hameshaa ke liye band ho gaye hai? ye sawaal jitna viru ko pareshaan kar rahe hai, utana hi unke prashansakon ko bhi
 The career of Nawab of Najafgarh, Virender Sehwag, has become a cornerstone for millions of cricket lovers across the world for his fire and courageous innings
 australia ke khilaaf hone vaale tii-twanti or pehle teen vanade maichon ke liye ghoshit team main ek baar phir viru kaa naam shaamil nahin he
 However, the question also arises that even if Sehwag was selected, on what basis? Since 2012, his form has steadily declined, with Viru scoring just 21 in ten odis in 2012
 70 ke maamuli ausat se 217 ran banaae, jisamen ek ardhashatak shaamil tha
 If we talk about 2013, he played only one ODI and could not take the innings beyond 31 runs
 haal hi main khatm hui chalanger trophy main sahvaag ne madhyakram main ballebaaji karne kaa faisla kiya, lekin vahaan bhi viru fail rahe or teen maichon main mahaj 72 ran bana paae, jo ki chayankartaaon ko prabhavit karne ke liye naakaafi tha
 As such, skipper MS Dhoni is now in favor of starting the innings with Rohit Sharma along with Shikhar Dhawan in t-twenty and One-day, while in the middle order, replacing Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Dhoni and Jadeja, Sehwag Does not happen
 to kya vanade cricket main sabase badi pari khilne vaale sahvaag kii vaapasi ab naammumkin si ho gai he?haalanki test team main vaapasi ke liye sahvaag ke paas ek mauka jarur he
 In the two unofficial Test matches against West Indies A, they will play for India a and if they manage to do well here, then there will be pressure on the selectors, but irrespective of it, what else would you say? Veeru's path will not be easy, because when India played their final Test series against Australia, then the openers Shikhar Dhawan and Murali Both Vijay were in excellent form and pushing them back and making a place in the team will not be easy for Veeru
 to kya ham maanakar chalem ki wo sahvaag jiske dar se duniya bhar ke gendbaaj thar-thar kaanpate the, wo sahvaag jiske liye sar vivian richards ne kaha tha ki ve sahvaag kaa khel dekhne ke liye paise tak kharch karne ko taiyaar hai, wo sahvaag jisane ek samay sachin tendulkar or saurav ganguli jaise diggajon kii chamak dhundhlee kar di thi, wo sahvaag jisane bhartiya cricket ko ek nayaa aayam diya, kya unke sitare ab gardish main chale gaye hai?
