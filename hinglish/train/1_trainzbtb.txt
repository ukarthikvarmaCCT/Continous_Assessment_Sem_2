aathvaan kaam hota he privet borwell ko kiraaye par lenaa
 The Latur administration has hired 1200 private borewells
 9waan kaam he tankeron ke zariye pani pahunchaana
 The administration has installed tankers for 250 villages with a capacity of 12,000 liters to 25,000
 aapako abhi-abhi to bataaya ki 940 gaanv hai latur main
 There is talk of transporting water from tanker in 250 villages
 itane dinon main prashasan ko kahana chahie tha ki hamane saare gaanvon ke liye intazaam kiya he
 When Santia went to cover the rural areas a few days ago, people in many villages told that the tanker arrives on seven days
 tabhi to tankeron ke pani ke liye maaramaari ho rahi he
 Now remember yourself
 baadh ke samay aapane dekha hoga ki helicopter se raahat saamagree kaa packet giraaya jaataa he
 Many people spread their hands below
 saamaan giraaya jaataa he or kuch logon ke haath lagata he or kuch logon ke nahin
 The helicopter moves forward
 pani kii rail kii haalat bhi yahi he
 It produces amazing scenes on TV but does not quench everyone's thirst
 hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra dilli ke jantar mantar par gaye
 Farmers from thirteen states have started demonstrations from today
 ye sabhi suukhaagrast ilaakon se chalakar dilli aae hai
 Hundreds of women and men farmers have come here
 aap sabhi ko jantar mantar jaakar in kisaanon se khud bhi baat kerani chahie ki sookhe se unke jivan par kya asar padataa he
 Sushil Mahapatra was shown his palm by an elderly woman from Madhya Pradesh
 mahila ne kaha ki dur dur se pani kaa bartan bhar kar laane se haath main chhaale jaise pad gaye hai
 The woman said that she had to walk for four hours to fetch water
 saath saal kii umr main kisi ko chaar ghante paidal chal kar pani laana ho to uski takalif ke aage pani kii rail kaa video dikhaanaa ek mazaaq se kam nahin he
 At least this water rail should tell that people have stopped walking for four hours for water due to its arrival
 gujarat se ai ek mahila bhi yahi shikaayat kar rahi thi
 He told that one has to walk for fifteen km for water
 aapako vaaki hairaani honi chahie or bilkul yakeen nahin karnaa chahie ki pani ke liye kisi ko pandrah kilometre paidal chalakar janaa padataa he
 That's why these women have come to show you
 kai log baat karte hue bhavuk ho gaye or krodhit bhi
 Well the water rail has gone to another place
 aap jaanate hai madhyapradesh or uttarapradesh ke bundelkhand ilaake main bhayankar sookhaa he
 Today, the central government sent a water train to Jhansi for Bundelkhand
 kisi ne yah tak nahin dekha ki jo tanker jhaansi stesan par khadey hai wo khadey hai yaa nahin lekin raajnneeti shuru ho gai
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav refused to take the water train
 rajya sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki pani kii rail bhejne se pehle kisi ne zila prashasan se poocha tak nahin ki pani chahie yaa nahin
 If it is factually correct, then the state should have been told by law
 upi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki train pahunchane ke baad railway ne soochna di
 Not only this, the Akhilesh government had asked for 10,000 tankers
 pani nahin
 Water is near the state
 bijepi ne bhi jawaab dene main deree nahin kii
 bjp's Uttar Pradesh president Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government should not do politics on water, it is wrong to return water when the water train is gone
 jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne bhi kaha ki bundelkhand ke bijepi saansadon ne apane ilaakon main pani kii killat kii baat kahi thi jiske baad pani bheja gaya
 Uma Bharti also wrote a letter to Akhilesh Sarkar in this regard, but by evening it was found that the train which has gone to Jhansi is empty
 usamen pani nahin he
 There has been so much ruckus about empty tankers
 tivi channelon par sabake intervyuu chalane lage or jamkar aarope-pratyarope ho gaye jaise sookhe ko lekar matdaan hone vaala he
 Jhansi District Magistrate Ajay Shukla started telling the tankers in front of many people that the train has come empty
 isamen pani nahin he
 While BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that water rail should come, then water should be taken
 uma bharti ne kaha ki bijepi saansadon ne apane ilaakon main pani kii kami kii baat kahi thi jiske baad pani bheja gaya he
 Both things should be investigated
 kya pani saansadon kii maang par bheja gaya
 Whether the Railway Ministry had previously given information to the district administration or not
 kyonki latur ke anubhav se aapane dekha ki pani kii rail ab ek vijual simbel ban gai he
 It makes a great scene that water has been transported by rail
 dilli ne bhi maharashtra ko pani bhejnaa kaa prastaav diya tha
 Quite a joke and the Maharashtra government refused
 sookhaa to madhya pradesh main bhi he
 The tanker moved to Jhansi from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh
 kya madhyapradesh ke ilaakon main gaye
 Elections are also going to be held in UP
 donon pakshon ne tathyon kaa sahi pataa lagaae bahes ko jan jan tak pahunchaa diya taaki massej jaae ki suukhaagrast ilaakon ke liye bada baari kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Drought does not just mean water crisis
 rojgaar kaa bhi sankat he
 Farming is not done
 kisaan kaa karza bad gaya he
 The Maharashtra government has decided that the loan to be repaid on May 30 will now be repaid for the next five years
 sarkaar pehle saal kaa 12 fisadi byaaj bhi bharegi
 It will cost five thousand crores
 latur ke atul devlekar ne ek gaanv main survey kiya he
 They found that 55 per cent of the families in a village are on the verge of suicide
 unke paas na to aamadani he na aamadani kii aas
 What will they do if it rains? sarkaar ne kuch jagahon par suukhaagrast ilaakon main prati hectare ke hisaab se muawza baante hai lekin yah muawza sirf zamin ke maalikon ko miltaa he
 Landless laborers working on the land or other people in the village are not found
 maharashtra sarkaar ne kai kadam uthaaye hai
 There is also a campaign to free many villages by 2019

 masaan film ke nirdeshak niraj ghahvaan or geetkaar varun grover ne apni puraskaar raashi se suukhaagrasta ilaakon main raahat pahunchane kaa elaan kiya he
 Neeraj has received the prize money of 1
25 lakh, out of which he is giving fifty thousand
 varun grover ko pachaas hazaar kii raashi inaam main mili he or wo apni puri raashi de rahe hai
 Varun Grover is the country's biggest industrialist
 inkaa korabar pachaas hazaar karod se lekar sava lakh karod tak kaa he
 i have said this in awe whether you have heard any such announcement from any industrialist
 isliye varun or niraj ke ek lakh rupee kaa mahatv kaaphi he
 With all these efforts, apart from the government, people of the society will also come forward
 thik he ki ham sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sakht rahete hai or rahanaa bhi chahie lekin sookhaa itnaa vyapak he ki sabko kuch na kuch karnaa hoga
 Many people want to do a lot, but they do not know what to do
 sarkaar ko chahie ki aisi koi vishwasaneey vyavastha banaae taaki dur baithe log bhi is prayaas se jud saken
 Many states have suffered drought
 lekin charchaa kuch hi jagahon kii ho paa rahi he
 Now tell you what is the condition of the reservoirs in the country
 desh main kul 91 bade jalashay hai, jinhen central water kamishan monitor karata he
 Today's condition is that out of these 7 large reservoirs there is no useable water, while there are 22 reservoirs which have less than 10% water capacity
 iskaa matlab ye he ki ek tihaai jalaashyon main ye to pani nahin he yaa das fisadi se kam he
 The Ministry of Agriculture of India has prepared a report on the status of ground water across the country
 farvari 2016 kii report he jis par rupal suhaag kaa naam likhaa he
 PRS Legislative Research has studied this report and made some points so that all of us who are in a hurry can understand what the problem is and what to do
 is report ke anusaar china or america kii tulana main bharat ke kisaan doguna pani kaa istomal karte hai anaaj ugane ke liye
 This report said that India is moving towards water crisis very quickly
 kyonki ham lagaataar bhumigat jal kaa zarurat se zyaada dohan karte ja rahe hai
 Water quality is also deteriorating
 bharat main sarphase water yani nadi-naharon ke pani kii uplabdhta zyaada he lekin ye sabhi jagahon par ek samaan tareeke se maujuud nahin he
 The result is that 89% of ground water is used in irrigation
 kisi bhi duusare desh ke muqaabale ye kahin zyaada he jo kaafii khataranaak sabit hone ja rahaa he
 50% of the water requirement of urban areas is met by ground water, while 85% of the water requirement of rural areas is met by ground water
 krishi mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik 1950 main bhumigat jal se 30% sinchai hoti thi lekin 2009 tak 61
 Irrigation from 6% of the area is being done from ground water while irrigation from river, canals is close to 25%
 aap sabhi ko indian express main chape harsh mandar kaa lekh padhanaa chahie
 It is in English but this article can help us understand many things
 hamane akaal or bhukhmaree kii samasya par jeet hasil kii he
 For some reason we are constantly ignoring the waste caused by drought
 harsh mandar likhte hai ki aakhir kya baat he ki ham sookhe ke in drishyon ko dekhakar baichaiyn nahin hote
 People do not get angry
 is ek baat par aapke ankar kii duusari raay he
 In this country full of problems, it is also not right for people to return to everything
 kisi masale kii sarthakata tabhi puri nahin hoti jab bade paimaane par log uttejit hi hon
 Surely people should be interested and ask about thirty types of governments running in India
 magar in sawaalon se ham yah na samajhen ki sarkaron kii bhoomika kam ho gai he
 If the government has less people then governments should fulfill their accountability by increasing jobs
 yah thik nahin he ki swatchta ke liye ham logon ke liye taaken
 For morality we look towards people and also to deal with drought
 yah daleel lambii chali to ek din sarkarein milakar logon kaa chunaav karengi ki aap hi dur kar lijie samasyaon ko
 People choose the government and the government will have to lead
 tippaniyan The big question is whether we understand the impact of drought
 harsh mandar ne likhaa he ki lagaataar tisare saal sookhaa padaa he
 So this time its effect is more profound
 kheti khatm ho gai he
 It will take a long time to improve farming conditions
 ham yah na samajhen ki in ilaakon main barish hote hi agle din se sab thik ho jayega
 55 per cent of the families do not own the land and they fully feed their families
 shaharon main bhi kaam kam he
 People are not getting enough food
 harsh kehete hai ki sarkari godaamon main 5 karod se 8 karod ton anaaj bharaa hua he
 Even colonial governments were guided by the Femin codes in such a situation
 guideline hoti thi ki un sabhi logon ko kam paise par naukari di jaae, unase saarvajanik kaam karaaye jaaen taaki guzar basar chal sake
 The tasks of providing food to children, old men, arranging fodder for cattle and carrying water were associated with them
 sarkaar ko manaregaa par or jor dena chahie or gaanv gaanv main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa abhiyaan chalaanaa chahie
 This does not seem to be happening
 sabko is saal behatar monsoon kii ummid he
 But you should think and look at your surroundings whether we are ready to take advantage of good monsoon
 barish kaa pani rokane ke liye kya upaay kiye gaye hai
 The government and society also have to think on this
 sthaneey logon ne santiya ko bataaya ki pehle bhi nigam vaale pani kaa tanker aath se das din ke antar par bhejte the
 Even today, water is available at a difference of eight to ten days
 prashasan kaa kahana he ki is vakt latur shahar ke logon ko pani chaar se paanch dinon ke antar par mil rahaa he
 During drought, water is calculated much less than normal days
 is vakt ke sarkari paimaane ke anusaar ek aadmi ko har din 20 litre pani diya jaataa he
 If there are four people in a family, then you will get 80 liters of water daily
 yah pani sirf pine or khaanaa banane ke liye hota he
 If a tanker arrives at a difference of ten days, 800 liters is required
 lekin nigam kii taraf se das din par 200 litre pani diya ja rahaa he
 Water needs a glass
 sarkaar pahunchaa rahi he ek katori
 Obviously the government does not have sea, but the water rail should not be considered as ocean
 yah bhi samajhiye ki aath se das din main jo tanker aate hai wo do se teen din kaa hi pani dekar jate hai
 It is not that governments will not be making efforts, but you have to understand whether this effort is sufficient, how basic is the solution, how much is it for the name and how much to show
 pani kii rail to ek hi jagah chali lekin aise dikhaaya ja rahaa he jaise saare suukhaagrast zilon main chal rahi he
 Santia told the administration that about 940 villages of Latur have a population of 17 lakh
 gaanvon ke liye pani kii rail nahin chali he lekin sookhaa ghoshit hone par 9 charan yani 9 kaam tay kiye gaye hai
 Under this, new borewells are excavated

 The already existing borewell is deepened

 The government is delivering a bowl
 zaahir he sarkaar ke paas samandar to he nahin lekin pani kii rail ko samandar bhi na samajha jaae
 Also understand that the tankers who come in eight to ten days go by giving only two to three days of water
 aisa nahin he ki sarkarein prayaas nahin kar rahi hongi lekin aapako samajhnaa yah he ki kya yah prayaas paryaapt he, kitna buniyadi hal he, kitna naam ke liye or kitna dikhaave ke liye
 The water train ran at one place but it is being shown as if it is running in all the drought-hit districts
 santiya ne prashasan se baat kar bataaya ki latur ke kareeb 940 gaanvon main 17 lakh kii aabaadi rahati he
 There is no water rail for the villages, but after the drought is declared, 9 phases i
e
 9 works have been decided
 iske tahat nae borwell kii khudaai hoti he
 Old borewells are repaired
 pehle se maujuud borwell ko gaharaa kiya jaataa he
 The wells are cleaned
 handpampon kii marammat kii jaati he
 Temporary water supply is ensured
 latur prashasan ne santiya ko phone se bataaya ki pehle saat charnon ke mutabik 500 chijen kar chuke hai
 The eighth job is to hire private borewells
 latur prashasan ne 1200 privet borwell kiraaye par liye hai
 The 9th task is to deliver water through tankers
 prashasan ne 250 gaanvon ke liye tanker lagaae hai jinaki kshamta 12 hazaar litre se 25,000 hoti he
 Just told you that there are 940 villages in Latur
 250 gaanvon main tanker se pani pahunchane kii baat ho rahi he
 In these days the administration should have said that we have made arrangements for all the villages
 santiya jab kuch din pehle gramin ilaakon ko cover karne gayi thi tab kai gaanvon main logon ne bataaya ki saat saat din par tanker aata he
 That is why there is a fight for the water of tankers
 ab aap khud se yaad kiijie
 At the time of the flood, you must have seen that a packet of relief material is dropped from the helicopter
 neeche kai log khadey haath failaate hai
 The goods are dropped and some people get their hands and some people do not
 helicopter aage bad jaataa he
 The condition of water rail is also the same
 yah tivi par to kamaal kaa drishy paidaa karti he magar sabaki pyaas nahin bujhaati he
 Our colleague Sushil Mahapatra went to Jantar Mantar in Delhi
 vahaan par teraa rajyon se aae kisaanon ne aaj se pradarshan shuru kiya he
 They have all come to Delhi from the drought-hit areas
 saikadon kii sankhya main mahila or purush kisaan yahaan aae hai
 All of you should go to Jantar Mantar and talk to these farmers themselves about how drought affects their lives
 susheel mahapatra ko madhyapradesh se ai ek buzurg mahila ne apni hatheli dikhaai
 The woman said that by filling the pot of water from far away, there are blisters in her hands
 mahila ne bataaya ki use pani laane ke liye chaar ghante tak paidal chalanaa padataa he
 At the age of sixty, if someone wants to walk on foot for four hours, then showing the video of water rail in front of his suffering is nothing less than a joke
 kam se kam yah pani kii rail yah bataaye ki iske aane se logon kaa pani ke liye chaar chaar ghante paidal chalanaa band ho gaya he
 a woman from Gujarat was also complaining
 inhone bataaya ki pandrah kimi tak pani ke liye chalanaa padataa he
 You must be really surprised and not believe at all that one has to walk fifteen kilometers for water
 tabhi to ye mahilaayein ain hai aapako dikhaane or bataane ke liye
 Many people got emotional while talking and were also angry
 khayr pani kii rail ek or jagah gai he
 You know there is severe drought in the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh
 bundelkhand ke liye aaj centre sarkaar ne pani kii ek train jhaansi bhej di
 No one has even seen whether the tankers standing at Jhansi station are standing or not, but politics has started
 upi ke mukhyamatri akhilesh yadav ne pani kii rail lene se manaa kar diya
 On behalf of the state government, it was said that before sending the water train, no one asked the district administration whether water is needed or not
 agar yah tathyaatmak rup se sahi he to kaayade se rajya ko bataanaa to chahie tha
 The UP government says that the railway gave information after the train arrived
 yahi nahin akhilesh sarkaar ne 1 xxrep 4 0 tanker maange the
 no water
 pani rajya ke paas he
 The BJP too did not delay in replying
 bijepi ke uttar pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko pani par raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie, jab pani kii train gai he to pani ko waapas karnaa galat he
 Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti also said that BJP mps from Bundelkhand had talked about water shortage in their areas after which water was sent
 uma bharti ne akhilesh sarkaar ko is silsile main ek chitthee bhi likh di, lekin shaam hote hote pataa chalaa ki jo train jhaansi gai he wo to khaali he
 There is no water in it
 khaali tanker ko lekar itnaa bavaal ho gaya he
 Interviews started running on TV channels and there were fierce accusations as if voting was going to be held on drought
 jhaansi ke ziladhikari ajay shukla kai logon ke saamne tankeron ko thok thok kar bataane lage ki train to khaali ai he
 There is no water in it
 jabaki bijepi pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha ki pani kii rail ai he to pani lenaa chahie
 Uma Bharti said that BJP mps had spoken about the scarcity of water in their areas, after which water has been sent
 donon hi baton kii jaanch honi chahie
 Was the water sent on the demand of mps? kya rail mantralay ne zila prashasan ko pehle soochna di thi yaa nahin
 Because from the experience of Latur you saw that the water rail has now become a visual symbol
 iskaa ek shandaar seen banataa he ki rail se pani pahunchaa di gai he
 Delhi also proposed to send water to Maharashtra
 kaaphi mazaaq uda or maharashtra sarkaar ne manaa bhi kar diya
 Drought is also in Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh ke ratlam se tanker jhaansi chale gaye
 Did you go to the areas of Madhya Pradesh? upi main chunaav bhi to hone vaala he
 The two sides have ascertained the facts correctly and sent the debate to the people so that the message is that huge work is being done for the drought-prone areas
 sookhe kaa matlab sirf pani kaa sankat nahin he
 There is also a crisis of employment
 kheti nahin hui he
 Farmer's debt has increased
 maharashtra sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki 30 may ko chukaaye jane vaale karj ko ab agle paanch saal tak chukaaya ja sakegaa
 The government will also pay 12 percent interest for the first year
 is par paanch hazaar karod kharch honge
 Atul Devlekar of Latur has conducted a survey in a village
 unhone paaya ki ek gaanv main 55 pratishat parivaar aise hai jo aatmahatya ke kagaar par hai
 They neither have income nor expectation of income
 barish ho bhi jaae to ve kya karenge
 In some places, the government has distributed compensation in drought prone areas per hectare, but this compensation is given only to the owners of the land
 zamin par kaam karne vaale bhoomihin mazaduron yaa gaanv ke anya logon ko nahin miltaa he
 The Maharashtra government has taken several steps
 isamen 2019 tak kai gaanvon ko sukhaamukt karne kaa bhi abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Aamir Khan reached Amravati in Maharashtra
 aamir khan mitti se bhare tasale ko ek duusare ko pakadaa rahe hai
 The work of digging the pond is going on here
 aamir khan or kiran raav kaa ek pani foundation he
 The Maharashtra government has also chalked out a plan with them
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii yojana he jiskaa naam he jalayukt shivi
 Aamir Khan is visiting different districts of Maharashtra to take stock of water conservation and drought relief
 aamir ne satyamev jayate ke dauraan satyamev jayate water cap pratiyogita kaa elaan kiya tha
 In this, the worker who manages to save the most water will be honored
 naanaa patekar or akshay kumaar ne kisaanon kii madad kii baat tabhi shuru kar di thi jab sarkarein kagaz par drawing bana rahi thim
 Masaan director Neeraj Ghahwan and lyricist Varun Grover have announced relief from their prize money in drought-prone areas
 niraj ko sava lakh kii puraskaar raashi mili he jisamen se wo pachaas hazaar rakam de rahe hai
 Varun Grover has received a sum of fifty thousand in reward and he is giving his full amount
 varun grover desh ke sabase bade udyogpati hai
 Their cost ranges from fifty thousand crores to 125 lakh crores
 yah baat maine tanj main kahi he ki kya aapane kisi udyogpati kii aisi koi ghoshnaa suni he
 Therefore, the importance of one lakh rupees of Varun and Neeraj is considerable
 in sab prayaason se yah hoga ki sarkaar ke alaava samaaj ke log bhi aage aaenge
 Well, we remain strict about the accountability of the government and should also remain, but the drought is so widespread that everyone will have to do something
 kai log kaaphi kuch karnaa chaahate hai magar unhen pataa nahin kiske zariye kya kar sakate hai
 The government should make such a reliable system so that even those sitting far away can join this effort
 kai rajyon main sookhaa padaa he
 But only a few places are being discussed
 ab aapako bataate hai ki desh main jalaashyon kaa kya haal he
 There are a total of 91 large reservoirs in the country, which the Central Water Commission monitors
 aaj kii haalat ye he ki inamen se 7 bade jalaashyon main istemaal ke laayak pani nahin bachaa he, jabaki 22 aise jalashay hai jinamein kshamta kaa 10 fisadi se bhi kam pani he
 This means that one-third of the reservoirs have no water or less than ten percent
 bharat ke krishi mantralay ne desh bhar main bhumigat jal kii sthiti par ek report taiyaar kii he
 There is a February 2016 report on which Rupal Suhag's name is written
 piares legislative research ne is report kaa adhyayan kar kuch baton ko binduvaar rakhaa he taaki ham sab jo jaldi jaldi main hai samaj saken ki samasya kya he or karnaa kya he
 According to this report, farmers in India use twice as much water as compared to China and America to grow grains
 is report main kaha gaya he ki bharat badi hi tezi se jal sankat kii ore bad rahaa he
 Because we are constantly exploiting ground water excessively
 pani kii gunvattta bhi karaab ho rahi he
 In India, the availability of surface water i
e
 river-canals is high but it is not present in all the places in the same way
 nateeja ye he ki bhumigat jal kaa 89% sinchai main istemaal hota he
 It is much more than any other country, which is going to prove to be very dangerous
 shahari ilaakon kii 50% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he, jabaki gramin ilaakon kii 85% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he
 According to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture, in 1950, 30% of the irrigation was done from ground water but till 2009 61
 6% ilaake main sinchai bhumigat jal se ho rahi he jabaki nadi, naharon se hone vaali sinchai qareeb 25% rah gai he
 All of you should read Harsh Mander's article printed in the Indian Express
 angrezi main he lekin yah lekh hamen kai chizon ko samajhane main madad kar saktaa he
 We have conquered the problem of famine and hunger
 kisi vajah se ham sookhe se hone vaali barbaadi ko lagaataar andekha kar rahe hai
 Harsh Mander writes that what is it that we are not restless seeing these scenes of drought
 logon main gussa nahin aata he
 Your anchor has a second opinion on this one thing
 samasyaon se bhare is desh main har baat ke liye logon kii taraf lautnaa bhi thik nahin he
 The significance of an issue is not fulfilled only when people are excited on a large scale
 zarur logon ko dilchaspee leni chahie or bharat main chal rahi tees prakaar kii sarkaron se poochna chahie
 But we should not understand from these questions that the role of governments has reduced
 agar sarkaar ke paas log kam hai to sarkaron ko naukariyaan badhaakar apni javabdehi puri kerani chahie
 It is not right that we look to people for cleanliness
 naitikta ke liye ham logon kii taraf taaken or sookhe se nipatane ke liye bhi
 If this argument goes on for a long time, then one day the governments will come together and elect the people that you should remove the problems
 log sarkaar chunate hai or sarkaar ko hi netritv karnaa hoga
 The comments bada sawaal he ki kya ham sookhe ke asar ko samajhate hai
 Harsh Mander has written that there has been a drought for the third consecutive year
 isliye is baar iskaa prabhaav zyaada gaharaa dikh rahaa he
 Farming is over
 kheti kii sthiti sudharne main lanbaa vakt lagegaa
 Let us not understand that everything will be fine from the next day as soon as it rains in these areas
 55 fisadi pariwaron ke paas zamin nahin he or wo puri tarah shaareerik shram karke apane pariwaron kaa pet paalate hai
 Work is also less in cities
 logon ko bharpayt khaanaa nahin mil rahaa he
 Harsh says that 50 million to 80 million tons of grain is loaded in government warehouses
 yahaan tak ki aupniveshik sarkarein bhi aisi sthiti main femin kods se guide hoti thim
 The guideline used to be that all those people should be given jobs on less money, they should be given public work so that the people can live
 bacchon, buudhon ko khaanaa dene, maweshiyon ke liye chaare kaa intazaam karne or pani ko laane le jane ke kaam unase jode jate the
 The government should put more emphasis on MNREGA and a village-wide employment generation campaign
 aisa hota dikhataa nahin he
 Everyone is expecting a better monsoon this year
 lekin aap sochiye or apane aasapaas ke ilaake kii ore nazar daudaiye ki kya ham achche monsoon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 What measures have been taken to stop rain water
 is par sarkaar ko bhi sochna he or samaaj ko bhi
 Now remember yourself
 baadh ke samay aapane dekha hoga ki helicopter se raahat saamagree kaa packet giraaya jaataa he
 Many people spread their hands below
 saamaan giraaya jaataa he or kuch logon ke haath lagata he or kuch logon ke nahin
 The helicopter moves forward
 pani kii rail kii haalat bhi yahi he
 It produces amazing scenes on TV but does not quench everyone's thirst
 hamaare sahyogi susheel mahapatra dilli ke jantar mantar par gaye
 Farmers from thirteen states have started demonstrations from today
 ye sabhi suukhaagrast ilaakon se chalakar dilli aae hai
 Hundreds of women and men farmers have come here
 aap sabhi ko jantar mantar jaakar in kisaanon se khud bhi baat kerani chahie ki sookhe se unke jivan par kya asar padataa he
 Sushil Mahapatra was shown his palm by an elderly woman from Madhya Pradesh
 mahila ne kaha ki dur dur se pani kaa bartan bhar kar laane se haath main chhaale jaise pad gaye hai
 The woman said that she had to walk for four hours to fetch water
 saath saal kii umr main kisi ko chaar ghante paidal chal kar pani laana ho to uski takalif ke aage pani kii rail kaa video dikhaanaa ek mazaaq se kam nahin he
 At least this water rail should tell that people have stopped walking for four hours for water due to its arrival
 gujarat se ai ek mahila bhi yahi shikaayat kar rahi thi
 He told that one has to walk for fifteen km for water
 aapako vaaki hairaani honi chahie or bilkul yakeen nahin karnaa chahie ki pani ke liye kisi ko pandrah kilometre paidal chalakar janaa padataa he
 That's why these women have come to show you
 kai log baat karte hue bhavuk ho gaye or krodhit bhi
 Well the water rail has gone to another place
 aap jaanate hai madhyapradesh or uttarapradesh ke bundelkhand ilaake main bhayankar sookhaa he
 Today, the central government sent a water train to Jhansi for Bundelkhand
 kisi ne yah tak nahin dekha ki jo tanker jhaansi stesan par khadey hai wo khadey hai yaa nahin lekin raajnneeti shuru ho gai
 UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav refused to take the water train
 rajya sarkaar kii taraf se kaha gaya ki pani kii rail bhejne se pehle kisi ne zila prashasan se poocha tak nahin ki pani chahie yaa nahin
 If it is factually correct, then the state should have been told by law
 upi sarkaar kaa kahana he ki train pahunchane ke baad railway ne soochna di
 Not only this, the Akhilesh government had asked for 10,000 tankers
 pani nahin
 Water is near the state
 bijepi ne bhi jawaab dene main deree nahin kii
 bjp's Uttar Pradesh president Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government should not do politics on water, it is wrong to return water when the water train is gone
 jal sansaadhan mantri uma bharti ne bhi kaha ki bundelkhand ke bijepi saansadon ne apane ilaakon main pani kii killat kii baat kahi thi jiske baad pani bheja gaya
 Uma Bharti also wrote a letter to Akhilesh Sarkar in this regard, but by evening it was found that the train which has gone to Jhansi is empty
 usamen pani nahin he
 There has been so much ruckus about empty tankers
 tivi channelon par sabake intervyuu chalane lage or jamkar aarope-pratyarope ho gaye jaise sookhe ko lekar matdaan hone vaala he
 Jhansi District Magistrate Ajay Shukla started telling the tankers in front of many people that the train has come empty
 isamen pani nahin he
 While BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that water rail should come, then water should be taken
 uma bharti ne kaha ki bijepi saansadon ne apane ilaakon main pani kii kami kii baat kahi thi jiske baad pani bheja gaya he
 Both things should be investigated
 kya pani saansadon kii maang par bheja gaya
 Whether the Railway Ministry had previously given information to the district administration or not
 kyonki latur ke anubhav se aapane dekha ki pani kii rail ab ek vijual simbel ban gai he
 It makes a great scene that water has been transported by rail
 dilli ne bhi maharashtra ko pani bhejnaa kaa prastaav diya tha
 Quite a joke and the Maharashtra government refused
 sookhaa to madhya pradesh main bhi he
 The tanker moved to Jhansi from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh
 kya madhyapradesh ke ilaakon main gaye
 Elections are also going to be held in UP
 donon pakshon ne tathyon kaa sahi pataa lagaae bahes ko jan jan tak pahunchaa diya taaki massej jaae ki suukhaagrast ilaakon ke liye bada baari kaam kiya ja rahaa he
 Drought does not just mean water crisis
 rojgaar kaa bhi sankat he
 Farming is not done
 kisaan kaa karza bad gaya he
 The Maharashtra government has decided that the loan to be repaid on May 30 will now be repaid for the next five years
 sarkaar pehle saal kaa 12 fisadi byaaj bhi bharegi
 It will cost five thousand crores
 latur ke atul devlekar ne ek gaanv main survey kiya he
 They found that 55 per cent of the families in a village are on the verge of suicide
 unke paas na to aamadani he na aamadani kii aas
 What will they do if it rains? sarkaar ne kuch jagahon par suukhaagrast ilaakon main prati hectare ke hisaab se muawza baante hai lekin yah muawza sirf zamin ke maalikon ko miltaa he
 Landless laborers working on the land or other people in the village are not found
 maharashtra sarkaar ne kai kadam uthaaye hai
 There is also a campaign to free many villages by 2019
 aamir khan maharashtra ke amravati pahunche
 Aamir Khan is holding each other in a mud-filled flat
 yahaan talab kii khudaai kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao have a Pani Foundation
 maharashtra sarkaar ne inke saath bhi milakar ek yojana banaai he
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has a scheme called Jalyukta Camp
 aamir khan maharashtra ke alag-alag zilon main ghumkar pani sangrakshan or sookhaa raahat kaa gauge le rahe hai
 Aamir announced the Satyamev Jayate Water Cup competition during Satyamev Jayate
 isamen jo bhi kaaryakarta sabase adhik pani bachaane main kaamyaab rahegaa use sammanit kiya jayega
 Nana Patekar and Akshay Kumar started talking about helping farmers only when governments were drawing drawings on paper
 masaan film ke nirdeshak niraj ghahvaan or geetkaar varun grover ne apni puraskaar raashi se suukhaagrasta ilaakon main raahat pahunchane kaa elaan kiya he
 Neeraj has received the prize money of 1
25 lakh, out of which he is giving fifty thousand
 varun grover ko pachaas hazaar kii raashi inaam main mili he or wo apni puri raashi de rahe hai
 Varun Grover is the country's biggest industrialist
 inkaa korabar pachaas hazaar karod se lekar sava lakh karod tak kaa he
 i have said this in awe whether you have heard any such announcement from any industrialist
 isliye varun or niraj ke ek lakh rupee kaa mahatv kaaphi he
 With all these efforts, apart from the government, people of the society will also come forward
 thik he ki ham sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sakht rahete hai or rahanaa bhi chahie lekin sookhaa itnaa vyapak he ki sabko kuch na kuch karnaa hoga
 Many people want to do a lot, but they do not know what to do
 sarkaar ko chahie ki aisi koi vishwasaneey vyavastha banaae taaki dur baithe log bhi is prayaas se jud saken
 Many states have suffered drought
 lekin charchaa kuch hi jagahon kii ho paa rahi he
 Now tell you what is the condition of the reservoirs in the country
 desh main kul 91 bade jalashay hai, jinhen central water kamishan monitor karata he
 Today's condition is that out of these 7 large reservoirs there is no useable water, while there are 22 reservoirs which have less than 10% water capacity
 iskaa matlab ye he ki ek tihaai jalaashyon main ye to pani nahin he yaa das fisadi se kam he
 The Ministry of Agriculture of India has prepared a report on the status of ground water across the country
 farvari 2016 kii report he jis par rupal suhaag kaa naam likhaa he
 PRS Legislative Research has studied this report and made some points so that all of us who are in a hurry can understand what the problem is and what to do
 is report ke anusaar china or america kii tulana main bharat ke kisaan doguna pani kaa istomal karte hai anaaj ugane ke liye
 This report said that India is moving towards water crisis very quickly
 kyonki ham lagaataar bhumigat jal kaa zarurat se zyaada dohan karte ja rahe hai
 Water quality is also deteriorating
 bharat main sarphase water yani nadi-naharon ke pani kii uplabdhta zyaada he lekin ye sabhi jagahon par ek samaan tareeke se maujuud nahin he
 The result is that 89% of ground water is used in irrigation
 kisi bhi duusare desh ke muqaabale ye kahin zyaada he jo kaafii khataranaak sabit hone ja rahaa he
 50% of the water requirement of urban areas is met by ground water, while 85% of the water requirement of rural areas is met by ground water
 krishi mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik 1950 main bhumigat jal se 30% sinchai hoti thi lekin 2009 tak 61
 Irrigation from 6% of the area is being done from ground water while irrigation from river, canals is close to 25%
 aap sabhi ko indian express main chape harsh mandar kaa lekh padhanaa chahie
 It is in English but this article can help us understand many things
 hamane akaal or bhukhmaree kii samasya par jeet hasil kii he
 For some reason we are constantly ignoring the waste caused by drought
 harsh mandar likhte hai ki aakhir kya baat he ki ham sookhe ke in drishyon ko dekhakar baichaiyn nahin hote
 People do not get angry
 is ek baat par aapke ankar kii duusari raay he
 In this country full of problems, it is also not right for people to return to everything
 kisi masale kii sarthakata tabhi puri nahin hoti jab bade paimaane par log uttejit hi hon
 Surely people should be interested and ask about thirty types of governments running in India
 magar in sawaalon se ham yah na samajhen ki sarkaron kii bhoomika kam ho gai he
 If the government has less people then governments should fulfill their accountability by increasing jobs
 yah thik nahin he ki swatchta ke liye ham logon ke liye taaken
 For morality we look towards people and also to deal with drought
 yah daleel lambii chali to ek din sarkarein milakar logon kaa chunaav karengi ki aap hi dur kar lijie samasyaon ko
 People choose the government and the government will have to lead
 tippaniyan The big question is whether we understand the impact of drought
 harsh mandar ne likhaa he ki lagaataar tisare saal sookhaa padaa he
 So this time its effect is more profound
 kheti khatm ho gai he
 It will take a long time to improve farming conditions
 ham yah na samajhen ki in ilaakon main barish hote hi agle din se sab thik ho jayega
 55 per cent of the families do not own the land and they fully feed their families
 shaharon main bhi kaam kam he
 People are not getting enough food
 harsh kehete hai ki sarkari godaamon main 5 karod se 8 karod ton anaaj bharaa hua he
 Even colonial governments were guided by the Femin codes in such a situation
 guideline hoti thi ki un sabhi logon ko kam paise par naukari di jaae, unase saarvajanik kaam karaaye jaaen taaki guzar basar chal sake
 The tasks of providing food to children, old men, arranging fodder for cattle and carrying water were associated with them
 sarkaar ko manaregaa par or jor dena chahie or gaanv gaanv main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa abhiyaan chalaanaa chahie
 This does not seem to be happening
 sabko is saal behatar monsoon kii ummid he
 But you should think and look at your surroundings whether we are ready to take advantage of good monsoon
 barish kaa pani rokane ke liye kya upaay kiye gaye hai
 The government and society also have to think on this

 inkaa korabar pachaas hazaar karod se lekar sava lakh karod tak kaa he
 i have said this in awe whether you have heard any such announcement from any industrialist
 isliye varun or niraj ke ek lakh rupee kaa mahatv kaaphi he
 With all these efforts, apart from the government, people of the society will also come forward
 thik he ki ham sarkaar kii javabdehi ko lekar sakht rahete hai or rahanaa bhi chahie lekin sookhaa itnaa vyapak he ki sabko kuch na kuch karnaa hoga
 Many people want to do a lot, but they do not know what to do
 sarkaar ko chahie ki aisi koi vishwasaneey vyavastha banaae taaki dur baithe log bhi is prayaas se jud saken
 Many states have suffered drought
 lekin charchaa kuch hi jagahon kii ho paa rahi he
 Now tell you what is the condition of the reservoirs in the country
 desh main kul 91 bade jalashay hai, jinhen central water kamishan monitor karata he
 Today's condition is that out of these 7 large reservoirs there is no useable water, while there are 22 such reservoirs which have less than 10% water capacity
 iskaa matlab ye he ki ek tihaai jalaashyon main ye to pani nahin he yaa das fisadi se kam he
 The Ministry of Agriculture of India has prepared a report on the status of ground water across the country
 farvari 2016 kii report he jis par rupal suhaag kaa naam likhaa he
 PRS Legislative Research has studied this report and made some points so that all of us who are in a hurry can understand what the problem is and what to do
 is report ke anusaar china or america kii tulana main bharat ke kisaan doguna pani kaa istomal karte hai anaaj ugane ke liye
 This report said that India is moving towards water crisis very quickly
 kyonki ham lagaataar bhumigat jal kaa zarurat se zyaada dohan karte ja rahe hai
 Water quality is also deteriorating
 bharat main sarphase water yani nadi-naharon ke pani kii uplabdhta zyaada he lekin ye sabhi jagahon par ek samaan tareeke se maujuud nahin he
 The result is that 89% of ground water is used in irrigation
 kisi bhi duusare desh ke muqaabale ye kahin zyaada he jo kaafii khataranaak sabit hone ja rahaa he
 50% of the water requirement of urban areas is met by ground water, while 85% of the water requirement of rural areas is met by ground water
 krishi mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik 1950 main bhumigat jal se 30% sinchai hoti thi lekin 2009 tak 61
 Irrigation from 6% of the area is being done from ground water while irrigation from river, canals is close to 25%
 aap sabhi ko indian express main chape harsh mandar kaa lekh padhanaa chahie
 It is in English but this article can help us understand many things
 hamane akaal or bhukhmaree kii samasya par jeet hasil kii he
 For some reason we are constantly ignoring the waste caused by drought
 harsh mandar likhte hai ki aakhir kya baat he ki ham sookhe ke in drishyon ko dekhakar baichaiyn nahin hote
 People do not get angry
 is ek baat par aapke ankar kii duusari raay he
 In this country full of problems, it is also not right for people to return to everything
 kisi masale kii sarthakata tabhi puri nahin hoti jab bade paimaane par log uttejit hi hon
 Surely people should be interested and ask about thirty types of governments running in India
 magar in sawaalon se ham yah na samajhen ki sarkaron kii bhoomika kam ho gai he
 If the government has less people then governments should fulfill their accountability by increasing jobs
 yah thik nahin he ki swatchta ke liye ham logon ke liye taaken
 For morality we look towards people and also to deal with drought
 yah daleel lambii chali to ek din sarkarein milakar logon kaa chunaav karengi ki aap hi dur kar lijie samasyaon ko
 People choose the government and the government will have to lead
 tippaniyan The big question is whether we understand the impact of drought
 harsh mandar ne likhaa he ki lagaataar tisare saal sookhaa padaa he
 So this time its effect is more profound
 kheti khatm ho gai he
 It will take a long time to improve farming conditions
 ham yah na samajhen ki in ilaakon main barish hote hi agle din se sab thik ho jayega
 55 per cent of the families do not own the land and they fully feed their families
 shaharon main bhi kaam kam he
 People are not getting enough food
 harsh kehete hai ki sarkari godaamon main 5 karod se 8 karod ton anaaj bharaa hua he
 Even colonial governments were guided by the Femin codes in such a situation
 guideline hoti thi ki un sabhi logon ko kam paise par naukari di jaae, unase saarvajanik kaam karaaye jaaen taaki guzar basar chal sake
 The tasks of providing food to children, old men, arranging fodder for cattle and carrying water were associated with them
 sarkaar ko manaregaa par or jor dena chahie or gaanv gaanv main rojgaar paidaa karne kaa abhiyaan chalaanaa chahie
 This does not seem to be happening
 sabko is saal behatar monsoon kii ummid he
 But you should think and look at your surroundings whether we are ready to take advantage of good monsoon
 barish kaa pani rokane ke liye kya upaay kiye gaye hai
 The government and society also have to think on this
 khayr pani kii rail ek or jagah gai he
 You know there is severe drought in the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh
 bundelkhand ke liye aaj centre sarkaar ne pani kii ek train jhaansi bhej di
 No one has even seen whether the tankers standing at Jhansi station are standing or not, but politics has started
 upi ke mukhyamatri akhilesh yadav ne pani kii rail lene se manaa kar diya
 On behalf of the state government, it was said that before sending the water train, no one asked the district administration whether water is needed or not
 agar yah tathyaatmak rup se sahi he to kaayade se rajya ko bataanaa to chahie tha
 The UP government says that the railway gave information after the train arrived
 yahi nahin akhilesh sarkaar ne 1 xxrep 4 0 tanker maange the
 no water
 pani rajya ke paas he
 The BJP too did not delay in replying
 bijepi ke uttar pradesh adhyaksh keshav prasad maury ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar ko pani par raajnneeti nahin kerani chahie, jab pani kii train gai he to pani ko waapas karnaa galat he
 Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti also said that BJP mps from Bundelkhand had talked about water shortage in their areas after which water was sent
 uma bharti ne akhilesh sarkaar ko is silsile main ek chitthee bhi likh di, lekin shaam hote hote pataa chalaa ki jo train jhaansi gai he wo to khaali he
 There is no water in it
 khaali tanker ko lekar itnaa bavaal ho gaya he
 Interviews started running on TV channels and there were fierce accusations as if voting was going to be held on drought
 jhaansi ke ziladhikari ajay shukla kai logon ke saamne tankeron ko thok thok kar bataane lage ki train to khaali ai he
 There is no water in it
 jabaki bijepi pravaktaa vijay bahadur pathak ne kaha ki pani kii rail ai he to pani lenaa chahie
 Uma Bharti said that BJP mps had spoken about the scarcity of water in their areas, after which water has been sent
 donon hi baton kii jaanch honi chahie
 Was the water sent on the demand of mps? kya rail mantralay ne zila prashasan ko pehle soochna di thi yaa nahin
 Because from the experience of Latur you saw that the water rail has now become a visual symbol
 iskaa ek shandaar seen banataa he ki rail se pani pahunchaa di gai he
 Delhi also proposed to send water to Maharashtra
 kaaphi mazaaq uda or maharashtra sarkaar ne manaa bhi kar diya
 Drought is also in Madhya Pradesh
 madhya pradesh ke ratlam se tanker jhaansi chale gaye
 Did you go to the areas of Madhya Pradesh? upi main chunaav bhi to hone vaala he
 The two sides have ascertained the facts correctly and sent the debate to the people so that the message is that huge work is being done for the drought-prone areas
 sookhe kaa matlab sirf pani kaa sankat nahin he
 There is also a crisis of employment
 kheti nahin hui he
 Farmer's debt has increased
 maharashtra sarkaar ne tay kiya he ki 30 may ko chukaaye jane vaale karj ko ab agle paanch saal tak chukaaya ja sakegaa
 The government will also pay 12 percent interest for the first year
 is par paanch hazaar karod kharch honge
 Atul Devlekar of Latur has conducted a survey in a village
 unhone paaya ki ek gaanv main 55 pratishat parivaar aise hai jo aatmahatya ke kagaar par hai
 They neither have income nor expectation of income
 barish ho bhi jaae to ve kya karenge
 In some places, the government has distributed compensation in drought prone areas per hectare, but this compensation is given only to the owners of the land
 zamin par kaam karne vaale bhoomihin mazaduron yaa gaanv ke anya logon ko nahin miltaa he
 The Maharashtra government has taken several steps
 isamen 2019 tak kai gaanvon ko sukhaamukt karne kaa bhi abhiyaan chalaaya ja rahaa he
 Aamir Khan reached Amravati in Maharashtra
 aamir khan mitti se bhare tasale ko ek duusare ko pakadaa rahe hai
 The work of digging the pond is going on here
 aamir khan or kiran raav kaa ek pani foundation he
 The Maharashtra government has also chalked out a plan with them
 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii yojana he jiskaa naam he jalayukt shivi
 Aamir Khan is visiting different districts of Maharashtra to take stock of water conservation and drought relief
 aamir ne satyamev jayate ke dauraan satyamev jayate water cap pratiyogita kaa elaan kiya tha
 In this, the worker who manages to save the most water will be honored
 naanaa patekar or akshay kumaar ne kisaanon kii madad kii baat tabhi shuru kar di thi jab sarkarein kagaz par drawing bana rahi thim
 Masaan director Neeraj Ghahwan and lyricist Varun Grover have announced relief from their prize money in drought-prone areas
 niraj ko sava lakh kii puraskaar raashi mili he jisamen se wo pachaas hazaar rakam de rahe hai
 Varun Grover has received a sum of fifty thousand in reward and he is giving his full amount
 varun grover desh ke sabase bade udyogpati hai
 Their cost ranges from fifty thousand crores to 125 lakh crores
 yah baat maine tanj main kahi he ki kya aapane kisi udyogpati kii aisi koi ghoshnaa suni he
 Therefore, the importance of one lakh rupees of Varun and Neeraj is considerable
 in sab prayaason se yah hoga ki sarkaar ke alaava samaaj ke log bhi aage aaenge
 Well, we remain strict about the accountability of the government and should also remain, but the drought is so widespread that everyone will have to do something
 kai log kaaphi kuch karnaa chaahate hai magar unhen pataa nahin kiske zariye kya kar sakate hai
 The government should make such a reliable system so that even those sitting far away can join this effort
 kai rajyon main sookhaa padaa he
 But only a few places are being discussed
 ab aapako bataate hai ki desh main jalaashyon kaa kya haal he
 There are a total of 91 large reservoirs in the country, which the Central Water Commission monitors
 aaj kii haalat ye he ki inamen se 7 bade jalaashyon main istemaal ke laayak pani nahin bachaa he, jabaki 22 aise jalashay hai jinamein kshamta kaa 10 fisadi se bhi kam pani he
 This means that one-third of the reservoirs have no water or less than ten percent
 bharat ke krishi mantralay ne desh bhar main bhumigat jal kii sthiti par ek report taiyaar kii he
 There is a February 2016 report on which Rupal Suhag's name is written
 piares legislative research ne is report kaa adhyayan kar kuch baton ko binduvaar rakhaa he taaki ham sab jo jaldi jaldi main hai samaj saken ki samasya kya he or karnaa kya he
 According to this report, farmers in India use twice as much water as compared to China and America to grow grains
 is report main kaha gaya he ki bharat badi hi tezi se jal sankat kii ore bad rahaa he
 Because we are constantly exploiting ground water excessively
 pani kii gunvattta bhi karaab ho rahi he
 In India, the availability of surface water i
e
 river-canals is high but it is not present in all the places in the same way
 nateeja ye he ki bhumigat jal kaa 89% sinchai main istemaal hota he
 It is much more than any other country, which is going to prove to be very dangerous
 shahari ilaakon kii 50% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he, jabaki gramin ilaakon kii 85% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he
 According to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture, in 1950, 30% of the irrigation was done from ground water but till 2009 61
 6% ilaake main sinchai bhumigat jal se ho rahi he jabaki nadi, naharon se hone vaali sinchai qareeb 25% rah gai he
 All of you should read Harsh Mander's article printed in the Indian Express
 angrezi main he lekin yah lekh hamen kai chizon ko samajhane main madad kar saktaa he
 We have conquered the problem of famine and hunger
 kisi vajah se ham sookhe se hone vaali barbaadi ko lagaataar andekha kar rahe hai
 Harsh Mander writes that what is it that we are not restless seeing these scenes of drought
 logon main gussa nahin aata he
 Your anchor has a second opinion on this one thing
 samasyaon se bhare is desh main har baat ke liye logon kii taraf lautnaa bhi thik nahin he
 The significance of an issue is not fulfilled only when people are excited on a large scale
 zarur logon ko dilchaspee leni chahie or bharat main chal rahi tees prakaar kii sarkaron se poochna chahie
 But we should not understand from these questions that the role of governments has reduced
 agar sarkaar ke paas log kam hai to sarkaron ko naukariyaan badhaakar apni javabdehi puri kerani chahie
 It is not right that we look to people for cleanliness
 naitikta ke liye ham logon kii taraf taaken or sookhe se nipatane ke liye bhi
 If this argument goes on for a long time, then one day the governments will come together and elect the people that you should remove the problems
 log sarkaar chunate hai or sarkaar ko hi netritv karnaa hoga
 The comments bada sawaal he ki kya ham sookhe ke asar ko samajhate hai
 Harsh Mander has written that there has been a drought for the third consecutive year
 isliye is baar iskaa prabhaav zyaada gaharaa dikh rahaa he
 Farming is over
 kheti kii sthiti sudharne main lanbaa vakt lagegaa
 Let us not understand that everything will be fine from the next day as soon as it rains in these areas
 55 fisadi pariwaron ke paas zamin nahin he or wo puri tarah shaareerik shram karke apane pariwaron kaa pet paalate hai
 Work is also less in cities
 logon ko bharpayt khaanaa nahin mil rahaa he
 Harsh says that 50 million to 80 million tons of grain is loaded in government warehouses
 yahaan tak ki aupniveshik sarkarein bhi aisi sthiti main femin kods se guide hoti thim
 The guideline used to be that all those people should be given jobs on less money, they should be given public work so that the people can live
 bacchon, buudhon ko khaanaa dene, maweshiyon ke liye chaare kaa intazaam karne or pani ko laane le jane ke kaam unase jode jate the
 The government should put more emphasis on MNREGA and a village-wide employment generation campaign
 aisa hota dikhataa nahin he
 Everyone is expecting a better monsoon this year
 lekin aap sochiye or apane aasapaas ke ilaake kii ore nazar daudaiye ki kya ham achche monsoon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai

 Jhansi District Magistrate Ajay Shukla started telling the tankers in front of many people that the train has come empty
 isamen pani nahin he
 While BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak said that water rail should come, then water should be taken
 uma bharti ne kaha ki bijepi saansadon ne apane ilaakon main pani kii kami kii baat kahi thi jiske baad pani bheja gaya he
 Both things should be investigated
 kya pani saansadon kii maang par bheja gaya
 Whether the Railway Ministry had previously given information to the district administration or not
 kyonki latur ke anubhav se aapane dekha ki pani kii rail ab ek vijual simbel ban gai he
 It makes a great scene that water has been transported by rail
 dilli ne bhi maharashtra ko pani bhejnaa kaa prastaav diya tha
 Quite a joke and the Maharashtra government refused
 sookhaa to madhya pradesh main bhi he
 The tanker moved to Jhansi from Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh
 kya madhyapradesh ke ilaakon main gaye
 Elections are also going to be held in UP
 donon pakshon ne tathyon kaa sahi pataa lagaae bahes ko jan jan tak pahunchaa diya taaki massej jaae ki suukhaagrast ilaakon ke liye bada baari kaam kiya ja rahaa he

 rojgaar kaa bhi sankat he
 Farming is not done

 The Maharashtra government has decided that the loan to be repaid on May 30 will now be repaid for the next five years
 sarkaar pehle saal kaa 12 fisadi byaaj bhi bharegi
 It will cost five thousand crores
 latur ke atul devlekar ne ek gaanv main survey kiya he
 They found that 55 per cent of the families in a village are on the verge of suicide
 unke paas na to aamadani he na aamadani kii aas
 What will they do if it rains? sarkaar ne kuch jagahon par suukhaagrast ilaakon main prati hectare ke hisaab se muawza baante hai lekin yah muawza sirf zamin ke maalikon ko miltaa he
 Landless laborers working on the land or other people in the village are not found

 There is also a campaign to free many villages by 2019

 With all these efforts, apart from the government, people of the society will also come forward

 According to this report, farmers in India use twice as much water as compared to China and America to grow grains
 is report main kaha gaya he ki bharat badi hi tezi se jal sankat kii ore bad rahaa he

 If the government has less people then governments should fulfill their accountability by increasing jobs
 yah thik nahin he ki swatchta ke liye ham logon ke liye taaken

 But you should think and look at your surroundings whether we are ready to take advantage of good monsoon
 barish kaa pani rokane ke liye kya upaay kiye gaye hai
 The government has to think on this as well as the community
 in sab prayaason se yah hoga ki sarkaar ke alaava samaaj ke log bhi aage aaenge
 Well, we remain strict about the accountability of the government and should also remain, but the drought is so widespread that everyone will have to do something
 kai log kaaphi kuch karnaa chaahate hai magar unhen pataa nahin kiske zariye kya kar sakate hai
 The government should make such a reliable system so that even those sitting far away can join this effort
 kai rajyon main sookhaa padaa he
 But only a few places are being discussed
 ab aapako bataate hai ki desh main jalaashyon kaa kya haal he
 There are a total of 91 large reservoirs in the country, which the Central Water Commission monitors
 aaj kii haalat ye he ki inamen se 7 bade jalaashyon main istemaal ke laayak pani nahin bachaa he, jabaki 22 aise jalashay hai jinamein kshamta kaa 10 fisadi se bhi kam pani he
 This means that one-third of the reservoirs have no water or less than ten percent
 bharat ke krishi mantralay ne desh bhar main bhumigat jal kii sthiti par ek report taiyaar kii he
 There is a February 2016 report on which Rupal Suhag's name is written
 piares legislative research ne is report kaa adhyayan kar kuch baton ko binduvaar rakhaa he taaki ham sab jo jaldi jaldi main hai samaj saken ki samasya kya he or karnaa kya he
 According to this report, farmers in India use twice as much water as compared to China and America to grow grains
 is report main kaha gaya he ki bharat badi hi tezi se jal sankat kii ore bad rahaa he
 Because we are constantly exploiting ground water excessively
 pani kii gunvattta bhi karaab ho rahi he
 In India, the availability of surface water i
e
 river-canals is high but it is not present in all the places in the same way
 nateeja ye he ki bhumigat jal kaa 89% sinchai main istemaal hota he
 It is much more than any other country, which is going to prove to be very dangerous
 shahari ilaakon kii 50% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he, jabaki gramin ilaakon kii 85% pani kii zarurat bhumigat jal se puri hoti he
 According to the data of the Ministry of Agriculture, in 1950, 30% of the irrigation was done from ground water but till 2009 61
 6% ilaake main sinchai bhumigat jal se ho rahi he jabaki nadi, naharon se hone vaali sinchai qareeb 25% rah gai he

 Everyone is expecting a better monsoon this year
 lekin aap sochiye or apane aasapaas ke ilaake kii ore nazar daudaiye ki kya ham achche monsoon kaa phayda uthaane ke liye taiyaar hai
 What measures have been taken to stop rain water
 is par sarkaar ko bhi sochna he or samaaj ko bhi
 Now tell you what is the condition of the reservoirs in the country
 desh main kul 91 bade jalashay hai, jinhen central water kamishan monitor karata he
 Today's condition is that out of these 7 large reservoirs there is no useable water, while there are 22 reservoirs which have less than 10% water capacity
 iskaa matlab ye he ki ek tihaai jalaashyon main ye to pani nahin he yaa das fisadi se kam he
 The Ministry of Agriculture of India has prepared a report on the status of ground water across the country
 farvari 2016 kii report he jis par rupal suhaag kaa naam likhaa he
 PRS Legislative Research has studied this report and made some points so that all of us who are in a hurry can understand what the problem is and what to do
 is report ke anusaar china or america kii tulana main bharat ke kisaan doguna pani kaa istomal karte hai anaaj ugane ke liye
 This report said that India is moving towards water crisis very quickly
 kyonki ham lagaataar bhumigat jal kaa zarurat se zyaada dohan karte ja rahe hai
 Water quality is also deteriorating
 bharat main sarphase water yani nadi-naharon ke pani kii uplabdhta zyaada he lekin ye sabhi jagahon par ek samaan tareeke se maujuud nahin he
 The result is that 89% of ground water is used in irrigation
 kisi bhi duusare desh ke muqaabale ye kahin zyaada he jo kaafii khataranaak sabit hone ja rahaa he
 50% of the water requirement of urban areas is met by ground water, while 85% of the water requirement of rural areas is met by ground water
 krishi mantralay ke aankadon ke mutabik 1950 main bhumigat jal se 30% sinchai hoti thi lekin 2009 tak 61

 bhartiya nausena ne pakistani nausena ke us daawey ko bakawaas bataaya he jisamen usne bhartiya pandubbi ke apane jal kshetra main ghusane kaa daawa kiya tha
 India has also termed this claim of Pakistani army as propaganda
 bataa den ki pakistani nausena ne islamabad main ek bayaan main daawa kiya he ki usne pakistan ke jal kshetra se bhartiya pandubbi ko dur rakhane ke liye vishesh kaushal kaa upyog kiya
 To this, the Indian Navy said that we have seen Pakistan propagating and propagating false information
 ham is tarah ke dushprachaar ko sangyaan main nahin legein
 Our deployment is unshakable
 nausena ke ek sankshipt bayaan main kaha gaya he ki bhartiya nausena raashtra ke samudri hiton kii hifaazat kii jarurat ke mutabik tainaat rahegi
 The Pakistan Navy has claimed this after the recent escalation of tension between the two nuclear-rich countries after the Pulwama terror attack
 As was stated during the Jt Press Statement on 28 Feb 19, the # indiannavy remains deployed as necessary to protect National Maritime Interests
 Over the past several days we have witnessed Pakistan indulging in false propoganda and spread of misinformation
 1 / 2paak nausena ke pravaktaa ne kaha ki pakistani nausena ne pandubbi ko rokane ke liye apane vishesh kaushal kaa upyog karte hue use pakistan ke jal kshetra se dur rakhaa
 He said that Indian submarines were not targeted in view of Pakistan's policy of peace
 bharat ko avashya hi is ghatana se sikh leni chahie or shanti kii disha main aage badhanaa chahie
 The official said that the Pakistani Navy is always ready to guard its waters and is able to respond strongly to any attack
 14 farvari ke pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad bhartiya vayusena ne pakistan ke balakot main 26 farvari ko jaish ke aatanki prashikshan thikaane par hamalaa kiya tha
 At the same time, the very next day, the Pak Air Force unsuccessfully tried to target Indian military installations in Kashmir
 gauratlab he ki pulavama hamale ke baad bharat or pakistan ke bich bade tanaav ke bich pakistani nausena ne mangalvaar ko daawa kiya ki usne apane desh ke jalakshetra main ghusane kii ek bhartiya pandubbi kii koshish ko naakaam kar diya
 The Pakistan Navy also shared a footage with the media which it said was real
 chitra main dikhaaya gaya he ki footage chaar march ko raat aath bajkar 35 minute par banaai gai
 a spokesman in this regard said in his statement that the Pakistani Navy used special skills to repel the submarine and succeeded in preventing it from entering Pakistani waters
 pravaktaa ne kaha ki pakistan kii shanti kii niti ke maddanager bhartiya pandubbi ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya gaya
 He said that India should learn from this incident and move towards peace
 nausena ne kaha ki pakistani nausena apane jalakshetra kii raksha karne ke liye sadaiv tatpar he or kisi bhi prakaar kii aakraamakata kaa puri takat ke saath jawaab dene main sakasham he
 The Navy claimed that this is the second such case since November 2016 when it has caught the Indian Navy trying to enter the waters of Pakistan
 report main kaha gaya he ki isse pehle 2016 main pakistan ne bhartiya pandubbi ko desh ke jalakshetra main pravesh karne se safaltaapurvak roka tha

 sensor board se alag hone ke baad pehali baar kisi bollywood film ke saath judane par ek baar phir pehlaaj nihlani khabaron main chaa gaye hai
 Pahlaj Nihalani, the x Chief of the censor board, is said to be unconcerned with Sanskari upon presenting the upcoming film Julie 2
 pehlaaj ne is bold film ko lekar un par uth rahe sawaalon ke jawaab die hai
 Julie 2 has teased its boldness ever since the teaser of the film was released
 lekin jaise hipahlaj nihlaniki is film ke saath jude hone kii khabaren mili hai tabhi se sab hairat main pad gaye hai ki aakhir sensor chif ke pad par rahete hue filmon kii boldnes par kanchi chalaane vaale aaj khud hi ek bold film kaa hissaa ban gaye hai

 sanskari hum or sanskari hi rahoongapahlaaj nihlanine kaha ki vah ab sensor board ke chif nahin he isliye ab vah apni film juli ke liye e certificate kii maang kar sakate hai 
 He said that he is distributing this film because no bold scenes are included in this film
 vah bole, 'main is film ke saath isaki kahani ko lekar judaa hum
 The story of this film is very special
 ye mere kariyar kii 50 veen film he isliye main is baat kaa puraa dhyaan rakhuunga or aisi hi film ke saath kaam karuunga jo mere kariyar ko ek kadam aage le jaae
 Pahlajbole said, 'if i were the censor chief, then there is no cut in Julie 2 because it is an adult film
 chaahe ise u / a yaa u certificate mili lekin main ise edlt film hi maanata hum
 i am sanskari, my motive is also sanskari and will remain sanskari in future
 ' juli 2 ke bold poster ko lekar pehlaaj ne saaf shabdon main kaha ki senshius poster sirf karmitial makasad se banaaya gaya he , main yahi kahana chaahunga ki cover ko dekhakar kitaab ko jaj naa karen 
 Pahlaj, speaking to India Today, clearly stated that his film is not going to get any cuts from the censor board nor will he go to the tribunal and the revising committee
 unhone kaha ki unki film ko a certificate milegaa
 Pahlaj said, 'those who have used the censor board for marketing of films are not among them
 'nihlani kaa khulaasa- sarkaar ne kaha tha 'udata punjab' paas nahin honi chahieskin sho, shahrukh or salmaan se nahin contate se chalati he filmensanskari se asanskari hone ke sawaal par pehlaaj ne kaha ki, maine apane sensor board ke kaarykaal main koi bhi aisi film paas nahin ki jo ki family ek saath baith ke naa dekh sake agar aisi kaai film hogi tab aap mujhe asanskari kahana
 Pahlaj stated clearly that Julie is associated with 2 only because of the content of the film
 pehlaaj kaa maananaa he ki film main content ho tabhi wo chalati he vah bole, skin sho dikhaa lo yaa salmaan yaa shahrukh, film tabhi chalegi jab content hoga
 Let me tell you that there are many films including Udta Punjab, Babumoshay gunman, which Pahlaj Nihalani had cut in many scenes of these films, describing them as pornographic, inciting violence and inappropriate for society

 Telecom and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said here after the cabinet meeting, "the cabinet today has come to the conclusion that people are facing problems with this system
" kai baar logon ko maheene main ek bhi silendar kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati or kai baar tyohaar ke mausam main ek se adhik silendar kii jarurat ho jaati he

 rajasthan main vasundhara raaje kii naiya paar lagane ke liye modi aaj tabadatod reliyaan kin
 After Bhilwara and Baneshwar Dham, he addressed a public meeting in Kota
 kota main unhone kaha ki aapke ek vot ne hindustan main har saal 90 hajaar karod kii jo chori hoti thi use rokane kaa kaam kiya he
 Explaining this theft, he gave the example of the tenure of the Congress government
 piem ne sonia gandhi or upie sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue bataaya, 'jab madam remote control se dilli main sarkaar chalaa rahi thim, to jo beti paidaa nahin hui, sarkari kaagajon main wo beti vidhwaa ho jaati thi or sarkari khajaane se use pension jaati thi
 Rations in the name of a family that did not even exist and were stolen
 ' piem modi ne ki hamane is chori ko rokane kaam kiya he
 Apart from this, PM Modi also commented on the face of CM candidate of Congress
 unhone kaha ki congress ne apane ummidavaar kaa naam parde ke peeche rakhaa hua he, kyonki use rajasthan kii janata par bharosa nahin he
 Modi said that the party which cannot tell you the name of the CM candidate, what will you trust him
 baneshwar main kya bole modiisase pehle baneshwar dham main raily ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki main aapkaa pyaar byaaj samet lautaaungaa
 He said that till Atal ji became the Prime Minister of the country, the Congress never remembered the tribals
 aazaadee ke itane saalon ke baad jab atal ji pradhanmantri bane, tab pehali baar atal ji ne alag adivasee mantralay banaaya
 Made tribal minister
 adivaasiyon ke liye alag bajet banaaya or tabase adivaasiyon ke vikaas kii gaatha shuru hui
 It is the job of the Congress to make promises before elections and then forget them
 piem ne kaha ki hamaara mat he ki desh ke andar bacchon ko padhai, yuvaaon ko kamai, kisaan ko sinchai, bujurgon ko dawaai or jan-jan kii sunwaayee kaa puraa prabandh hona chahie
 On the occasion of 75 years of independence, that is, by 2022, i have resolved that by then every citizen of the country will have their own house
 ye ghar puraa hoga, yani ghar main nal, nal main jal, bijli, gas conection sab kuch hoga
 In Rajasthan, the keys of seven lakh houses have been given to the people
 rahul par hamalapiem ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kaa naam liye bina kaha ki ye namdaar kaa gyaan bahut kam he
 They come to Kailas Mansarovar, but they do not know anything about there
 modi ne kaha ki congress ke raaj main desh main sirf chaar mobile factory thim, jabaki aaj ye 125 hai
 Modi said that those who do not know the difference between moong and gram, they talk about the farmer
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress aaj itani sikud gai he ki ve sirf namdaar kii hokar rah gai he
 The Congress believes that first the Namdar, then the family, then the family court and then the vote bank contractor, then casteism, then they remember someone in the country
 hamaare liye dal se bada desh he
 What did Modi say in Bhilwara? Before this, PM held a rally in Bhilwara, Rajasthan
 raily main unhone kaha ki yahaan ek baar phir se bijepi kii sarkaar banegi
 Referring to the Mumbai attack, PM Modi said that today is 26 November
 jab dilli main madam kaa raaj chalata tha, remote control se chalata tha, jab maharashtra main congress kii sarkaar thi, tab 26 / 11 ko mumbai main aatankwaadiyon ne hamalaa karke hamaare desh ke logon ko, javaanon ko goliyon se bhun diya tha
 Congress used to teach patriotism at that time
 baad main vahi congress sargical strike par sawaal uthaati rahi
 He said that the days in the Congress government were a blast
 piem modi ne congress netaaon dwaara khud par diye gaye bayanon par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 Modi said that the Congress nominees also question my caste after my parents
 piem ne kaha ki aazaadee ke 60-65 saal biit gaya
 Four years of chaiwala are heavy on four generations of Congress
 unhone kaha ki modi sone kaa chammach lekar paidaa nahin hua
 He saw the poor mother cooking food on a wooden stove
 isliye usne aakar ke desh ke 90% gharon main gas kaa chulhaa pahunchaa diya
 Counting the work of his government, PM Modi said that before our arrival there was not even 40 percent toilet facility in the village
 4 saal main modi ne ise 40 pratishat se 95 pratishat kar diya
 This is called work
 65 saal main 40% or 4 saal main 95%
 The PM said that if the Congress has worked, then the account will also have to be given
 mana ja rahaa he ki pradesh main log vasundhara raaje se khush nahin hai, lekin ab pradesh bijepi ko piem modi kaa sahaara he
 In the past, these slogans were also heard saying 'vasundhara Teri Khair Nahin Modi Tujh Se Hate No' means that now BJP in Rajasthan wants to spread its further election in the face of PM Modi
 yahi vajah he ki piem modi ne madhya pradesh ke baad rajasthan ke ran main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 In such a situation, the question is that PM Modi will reduce the anger of the people against Vasundhara Raje? To get latest update about Rajasthan elections SMS RJ to 52424 from your mobile

 Living in a live-in relationship, like a husband and wife without being tied to the bond of marriage, has increased rapidly
 supreme court ne bhi isko kanoonee manyata de di he
 While delivering the judgment in Indra Sharma v
 VKV Sharma, the Supreme Court had said that live-in relationship is neither a crime nor a sin
 shaadi karne yaa na karne or sexual relationships banane kaa faisla puri tarah se nijee he
 Therefore, a girl who has completed the age of 18 and a boy who has completed the age of 21 can live in a live-in
 sheersh court ne liv-in ko kanoonee kavach jarur pahana diya he, lekin liv-in partner ko aaj bhi wo puure kanoonee adhikaar nahin milte hai, jo ek shaadishuda mahila ko apane pati kii sampatti main milte hai
 Due to this, many times women live-in partners have to face a lot of problems
 is sambandh main supreme court baar association ke upaadhyaksh jitendra mohan sharma kaa kahana he ki bharat main liv-in ko behad looj relationships mana jaataa he
 The married woman does not get as many legal rights as the woman living in the live-in
 edwocket wike shrivastav kaa kahana he ki sabase pehali baat to yah he ki liv-in main rahane vaale logon ke liye apane partner ke saath relationships hone kii baat sabit karnaa behad mushkil hota he
 If circumstantial evidence means rent agreement, joint bank account, documents of partnership business, or even if it is proved to be in live-in through the biological child, then the woman living in the live-in will also get the partner
 the property does not include any rights to receive
 haalanki mahila liv-in partner se guzaara bhatta ke liye daawa kar sakati he
 Women live-in partners can only get alimony, according to VK Srivastava, under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act-2005, women live-in partners can also ask for alimony under the married wife
 yah daawa sirf purush liv-in partner ke jivit rahane par hi kiya ja saktaa he
 If the male live-in partner dies, the female partner will not receive alimony
 iske alaava dand prakriya samhita yani siarpisi kii dhara 125 ke tahat bhi mahila liv-in partner guzaara bhatta kii maang kar sakati he
 How to get the property of the live-in partner? Senior advocate of the court, Jitendra Mohan Sharma, said that if the woman living in the live-in wants legal rights over the property of her partner, then she should be bequeathed in her name
 varanaa liv-in main rahane vaali mahila ko apane liv-in partner kii sampatti main koi adhikaar nahin milegaa
 In addition, a woman should register herself as the nominee of a live-in partner in an insurance policy
 jitendra mohan sharma kaa yah bhi kahana he ki liv-in main rahane vaale agreement ke jariye bhi liv-in partner kii sampatti main haq hasil kar sakate hai
 For this, those living in the live-in should register the agreement with the Registrar Office
 is agreement main sampatti ke haq ko lekar spasht ullekh hona chahie
 Children born to live-in get full legal rights
 a woman living in a live-in may not get any legal rights over the property of the live-in partner, but her biological child gets full rights
 hindu marij act ke tahat liv-in se janme bachche ko wo sabhi kanoonee adhikaar milte hai, jo shaadishuda danpati se janme bachche ko milte hai
 He says that a child born to a live-in can get a share in the property of his biological father under the Hindu Succession Act
 videsh main liv-in relationships main rahane vaale jaagrudagar koi mahila videsh main liv-in relationships main rahati he, to usko vahaan ke sthaneey kanoon ke tahat adhikaar milte hai
 There are different laws regarding this in every country
 isse bhi ahm baat yah he ki videsh main liv-in main rahane vaale log apane kanoonee adhikaar ko lekar behad alert rahete hai
 However, people living in live-in India are very careless about their legal rights, due to which they have to face many problems

 Former India coach Greg Chappell has said that his relationship with Sachin Tendulkar soured when he asked the legendary Indian batsman to bat in the 2007 World Cup in lower order
 tendulkar ne apni aatmakatha 'plaing it maai ve' main australia ke is purv captain par hamalaa bolte hue unhen 'ringamaster' qaraar diya tha, jiske kuch maheenon baad 66 varshiya chapel ne pratikriya di he
 In an episode of 'cricket Legends' shown across Australia on 'fox Sports', Chappell has stated that the reason for his differences with Tendulkar was to suggest this batsman to bat in the lower order during the tournament in the West Indies
 chapel ne kaarykram main kaha, 'maine ummid kii thi, maine sochaa tha ki vah vahi cheez karnaa chahega, jo team ke liye sahi hoga
 But he wanted to bat where he liked and that created a gap between us
 ' bharat ke liye 2007 vishwacap traasadee kii tarah rahaa tha or team pehle daur se bhi aage badhane main naakaam rahi thi
 Chappell said that Tendulkar initially agreed to his proposal, but later changed his mind
 chapel ne kaha, pari kii shuruaati karnaa uski pasand thi, lekin westeindies main hamen jarurat thi ki vah nichle kram main ballebaaji kare
 This was the problem with our batting, we had other players who could bat in the top order
 unhone kaha, vah shuruyaat main raji ho gaya tha, lekin baad main peeche hat gaya tha or kaha ki vah aisa nahin karnaa chahta tha

 is tarah se kejariwal ne dilli main shila dikshit ke shashan main bijli bilon or companiyon kii manamaani ke khilaaf janata main bigul bajaane kaa kaam kiya tha
 It is believed that Shivraj Singh Chauhan is also on the same map

 is sawaal ke jawaab main mani ne kaha ki yah sach he ki annadurai, mjiaar, jayalalita, ne cinema kii publicity kaa istemaal kar druvid raajnneeti main jagah par kabja kiya
 But today leaders are doing the same thing and using social media, they are gaining publicity for themselves
 iske baavjood yah daawa nahin kiya ja saktaa ki koi film abhinayta mahaj filmon ke boote desh main bada netaa banane main safal ho jaae
 During this session AIADMK leader v Maitreyan said that there is no threat in Tamil Nadu on the legacy of Amma
 haalanki maitreyan ne mana ki party ke liye behad mushkil ghadi he lekin phir bhi party ke paas ammaa dwaara kiya gaya kaam hi chunaav jeetne ke liye sabase badi takat he
 However, speaking on the issue, DMK leader Manuraj Shunmugasundaram said that the future of Tamil Nadu politics is not scattered after Jayalalithaa's departure
 rajya ke agle do saal isliye ahm he kyonki aise samay main yah dekhne kii jarurat he ki rajya main bijepi ko rokane ke liye kya kavayad kii jaati he
 According to Manuraj, the Dravidian Legacy is threatened by the BJP
 is satr ke dauraan aisa hi sawaal andhrapradesh main tab uthne kaa zikr kiya gaya jab wiesar kaa nidhan hua tha lekin samay ke saath in sawaalon ko bebuniyaad sabit kar diya gaya
 The essence of the discussion during this session rests on the jok shared by Rahul Kanwal where Kanwal said that Rajinikanth has joined Rajinikanth, not politics

 The character of Villain in the film 'detective Byomkesh Bakshi' was first offered to Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan, but for some reason Aamir refused to play the role
 iske baad ye negative role niraj kaabi ko ofer hua
 Sushant Singh Rajput starrer film 'detective Byomkesh Bakshi' has been released on this Friday
 jab ye film likhi gai thi or ise banane kii taiyaari shuru kii gai thi, tab iske nirdeshak dibaakar banerjee villen ke role kaa ofer lekar aamir khan ke paas gaye the, magar kisi vajah se aamir ne is kirdaar ko nibhaane ke liye manaa kar diya tha
 Neeraj Kabi was then decided to play this role
 sushant singh rajput ne enditivi ko bataaya, "aamir khan ko villen kaa ye role tab ofer hua tha, jab bataur hero main bhi film se nahin judaa tha
 It is a fact that Dibakar Banerjee took the offer to Aamir, but even then i was not a part of the film "
 sushant ne ye bhi kaha, "agar aamir is film main hote to beshak is film kaa huliya kuch or hota, isaki rangath kuch or hoti lekin is kirdaar ko niraj kaabi ne bhi bahut achche se nibhaayaa he
 We also did a workshop before the shoot, it showed a different color from there itself
 har kalakaar apana rang lekar aata he, niraj kaa bhi apana ek alag rang he"
 Anyway, Aamir Khan does not repeat his character quickly and perhaps Aamir may have refused the role too because the film 'dhoom 3' with Aamir's negative role was released at that time

 reports ke mutabik, ise railway agle maheene se lagu kar saktaa he
 Two types of slabs will be made to give up subsidies, the first one is to give up 50 percent subsidy and the second is to leave 100 percent i

 The Supreme Court gave four options to Srinivasan
 His lawyer Kapil Sibal said that Srinivasan will not participate in the BCCI executive committee and IPL governing meetings as long as the matter is under investigation
 isse pehle mangalvaar ko ipel-6 main hui sattebaaji or spot phixing maamle main sunwaayee kar rahi supreme court ne shrinivasana ko jamkar latada or poocha ki unhone bisisiai kii kaarysmiti main hissaa kyon liya? nyaayamurti tii

 thakur or fakir mohammad ibrahim kalipholla kii peeth ne shrinivasana kii manshaa par sawaal uthaate hue poocha tha, 'ek taraf aap kehete hai ki ki aap board ke nirnay lene kii prakriya se dur rahenge jabaki duusari ore tamilnadu cricket sangh ke madhyam se aap bisisiai kii kaarysmiti main hissaa lete hai
 'the court told Srinivasan,' You attend the BCCI meeting three weeks ago
 aapane court se jo kaha he kam se kam use to aapako nibhaana chahie or khud ko alag rakhana chahie
 The court's remarks came during the hearing of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the Bihar Cricket Association
 gauratlab he ki isi maamle kii sunwaayee ke tahat court ne shrinivasana ko bisisiai se dur rahane ko kaha tha
 The court is also hearing about the alleged betting in the IPL and a conflict of interest after Srinivasan's son-in-law and the name of Chennai Super Kings' team official Gurunath Meiyappan
 isi saal march main court ne bisisiai ke upaadhyaksh shivlal yadav ko board kaa kaaryakari adhyaksh banaaya tha or purv cricket khilaadi sunil gavaskar ko us samay jari ipel toornament se jude kaamkaaj ko sanbhaalane ko kaha tha
 At that time Srinivasan had told the court that he would stay away from the cricket board till the investigation against him continued
 sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne shrinivasana se yah poocha tha, 'aap bisisiai ke adhyaksh hai, aapke damaad par aarope hai
 In such a situation, the question is who will punish them
 ham chaahate hai ki bisisiai nishpaksh yaa kisi bhi prakaar kii tarafdaari se dur rahe
 At the same time, the court asked whether it would not be right that Srinivasan should be banned from contesting BCCI elections for the next 10 years
 is par shrinivasana ke vakil kapil sibbal ne kaha tha ki agar court chaahe to ek swatantra anushaasan samiti bhi bana sakati he jo hiton ke takaraav kaa maamla bhi dekhegi
 On this, the court had told Srinivasan that if the conflict of interest is found to be right then it cannot be allowed for the future of the game
 saath hi court ne kaha ki agar vah bisisiai ke adhyaksh pad par bane rahanaa chaahate hai, to chennai superkings main unka nivesh khatre main pad jayega
 Reacting very cautiously to Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao's recent meeting with the Dalai Lama, a thorn in China's eye, Beijing said it hoped India would stick to its resolve not to allow exiled Tibetans for anti-china activities

 "he said" The Indian government has told Beijing several times that it considers Tibet to be part of China and will not allow its exiled Tibetan people living here to carry out anti-china political activities
 yahi vajah he ki hamen puri ummid he ki bharat tibet se jude muddon ko lekar apane sankalp par kaayam rahegaa
 In the eyes of experts, Kin's remarks are quite soft as China has so far reacted strongly to the meeting of the country's top officials with the Dalai Lama
 america raashtrapati baraak obama or dalai lamas ke bich haal main washington main hui mulaakaat kii china ne kadi aalochana kii thi
 China considered the meeting an interference in matters related to Beijing's sovereignty

 kendriya vitt mantri pi
 Chidambaram said on Tuesday that calling the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) a 'parrot of Pizade' or 'congress Bureau of Investigation' is wrong
 chidambaram ne sibiai ko niti nirmaan or use lagu karne ke bich ke fark kaa sammaan karne ko kaha
 He said that the investigating agency should be limited to implementing the policies and should not question the policies
 'bhrashtachar or aparaadh se ladane ke liye samaan nitiyon ke vikaas' ke mudde par yojit sibiai ke antarrashtriya sammelan main chidambaram ne kaha, "main jaanch agency ko aagaah karnaa chaahunga ki vah niti nirmaan or use lagu karne ke bich kii vibhaajak rekha kaa sammaan kare
 "he said," The job of the investigating agency is not to set any rules of conduct nor is it to argue any rules of conduct
 " Chidambaram said that the investigating agency should confine itself only to whether a rule has been violated or not
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne bhi somvaar ko aise hi vichaar prakat kiye the or kaha tha ki yah thik nahin he ki jaanch agenciyaan har nitigat nirnay par faisla sunaane lagen jo ki acchhee bhaavana se liye gaye hote hai
 Even if they are later found to be wrong, there is no wrong intention or personal monetary gain behind them
 iske saath hi chidambaram ne un aaropon ko khaarij kar diya, jinamein kaha ja rahaa he ki centre sarkaar jaanch agency kii karypranali main hastkshep karti he
 Chidambaram said, "there are many myths about CBI
 isamen charchit visheshan 'pijade kaa tota' se lekar apmanjanak naam 'congress beuro of investigeshan' shaamil hai
 None of these adjectives is neither correct nor meaningful
 " Chidambaram said, "some myths were carefully fabricated and propagated for narrow self-interest
 " Chidambaram said, "in a lighter vein, i can say that when the CBI urges powers and greater autonomy, it seems that it is pretending to be a helpless victim
 " Chidambaram, however, praised the work of CBI and said, "I think CBI is as good as any good investigative agency in the world
" hamen sibiai kii uplabdhiyon par garv he
 " ullekhneey he ki is varsh may main koyala block aavanton main aniyamitata se sambandhit ek maamle main sarvocch nyaayalay ne sibiai ko 'pijade kaa tota' qaraar diya tha, jo 'apane maalik ke sur main sur milaataa he'
