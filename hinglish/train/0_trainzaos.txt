 For example, Indira Gandhi's son Sanjay Gandhi is said to have been rebuked by Indra Kumar Gujral, it is said to be Gujral's own words
 iske alaava yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki sonia gandhi ne 1999 main hi tay kar liya tha ki congress satta main ai, to manmohan piem honge
 Whether it is the President's cry in the Babri Masjid demolition case or Amar Singh and then sp's revenge stand on the nuclear deal after a meeting during treatment in the US, Sanghvi has provided many interesting and new details of all important political developments

 Talk to Sanjay Gandhi about Gujral, talk to the seniors from Tamizh, Emergency phase
 indra kumaar gujral indira sarkaar main soochna prasaaran mantri
 After a cabinet meeting, Indira Gandhi's son Sanjay Gandhi ordered Gujral
 main ol india radio ke news bulatin prasaarit hone se pehle dekhnaa chahta hum
 Gujral replied bluntly
 ye mumkin nahin
 i also never watch before the broadcast
 tabhi indira aati hai or baat ko taalte hue kahati hai, ise baad main dekhte hai
 a few days later, Gujral is summoned to the Prime Minister's residence
 jab vah pahunchate hai, to pate hai ki indira to apane daftar ke liye nikal chuki hai
 Sanjay Gandhi is standing in front of him
 sanjay gujral ko chetate hue kehete hai, dekhie aise nahin chalegaa
 Gujral gave the answer, which no other minister of the Indira cabinet could even imagine
 gujral bole, dekhie yahaan
 It will last as long as i am
 or aap yah tameez seekhenge ki varishton se kaise baat kii jaati he
 Gujral did not stop here
 unhone kaha ki meri aapke prati koi javabdehi nahin he
 i am a minister in your mother's government
 yah kahkar gujral chale gaye or phir unase istipha maang liya gaya

 80 ke daur kaa punjabatankwaadi bhindrawaale ke khauf ke saaye main amritsar kaa swarna mandir
 One day the DIG of Punjab Police visits Atwal Mandir
 darshan karte hai, prasad pate hai
 During the return, one can only reach the stairs that a bullet pierces their body
 ye goli bhindrawaale kii toli ke ek aatankwaadi ne chalaai thi
 Who was ambushed in his bunker in the guest house next to the temple
 puure shahar, puure soobe, puure mulk main sansani daud jaati he
 Such action in this most sacred house of Sikhs
 magar shame ko abhi or paimaane tay karne the
 The fear of Bhindranwale and his henchmen in the police force is that even Atwal's body could not be picked up
 24 ghante tak unka shav vahiin sidhiyon par padaa rahaa
 Then the District Magistrate of Amritsar went to Bhindranwale, begged and then he allowed Atwal's body to be taken
 iske baad halaat or kharaab hote gaye or phir fouj ne oparation blue star ko anjaam diya
 It also killed soldiers, officers, innocent pilgrims, terrorists and yes, Bhindranwale on a large scale

 President Shankar Dayal Sharma was crying 6 December 1992, 12 noon
 30 baje desh bhar ko pataa chal gaya ki unmaadi karsevak ayodhya main babari masjid ke ek gumbad par chadhakar use todane main jute gaye hai
 All Muslim leaders based in Delhi started calling at the Prime Minister's Office
 hastkshep kii ummid ke saath
 But every time the answer is received, the Prime Minister is resting
 dopaher 2
 At 30, many leaders, philanthropists and religious leaders came to meet President Shankardayal Sharma
 sharma ro rahe the
 He showed the people a letter
 ye khat sharma ne pradhanmantri narsimha raav ko likhaa tha
 It said that the situation in Ayodhya is explosive, the situation of the BJP government in the state is not clear
 aise main rajya sarkaar barkhaast kar centre ko suraksha vyavastha apane haath main le leni chahie
 Then Sharma said, but i too could not reach the Prime Minister
 yahaan yah bhi yaad karnaa jaruri he ki shankaradayal sharma ke inkaar ke baad hi narsimha raav ko pradhanmantri kii kursi mili thi
 In fact, everyone in the party was expecting leadership from his widow Sonia Gandhi after Rajiv Gandhi's assassination at the hands of the LTTE suicide bomber at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu
 sabhi ne unase congress adhyaksh banane ko kaha
 At that time, it was clear that the party which would take over, would become the Prime Minister on coming to power
 sonia ne isse saaf inkaar kar diya
 But the new president was made with his consent, it was clear
 sonia ne parivaar ke puraane saathi or naukarshah rahe pien hakasar se mashvira kiya
 Haksar suggested the name of Vice President Shankar Dayal Sharma
 sharma ne apane kharaab swasth kaa hawala dete hue inkaar kar diya
 Then came the turn of Narasimha Rao
 us vakt tak raav raajnneeti se sanyas lene kaa man bana chuke the
 He was not in Rajiv Gandhi's good book
 haalat ye ho gaye the ki unki rajyasabha saansadi bhi khatm ho gai thi
 When he was ready to go to Hyderabad, Sonia announced
 oleraite, its pivi dein
 And Narasimha Rao got the command of the country after the first party and then the election results

 Mayawati touched Atal's feet and then betrayed April 1999, 13 months had passed since Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government was in power
 tabhi gathbandhan kii ahm sahyogi jayalalita kii ediemke ne samarthan waapas le liya
 The government came in a minority
 uttar pradesh main bijepi ke sahyog se mukhyamantri rah chuki bispi supremeo mayawati ne atal ke raajnneetik prabandhakon ko bharosa dilaayaa ki vah endie kaa samarthan karengi
 At that time, there was a cost of one vote each
 vishwaas mat par voting vaale din mayawati atal se milane gayi, unke pair chhue or party ke chah saansadon ke samarthan kii baat kahi
 But then Mayawati overturned in the Lok Sabha
 bispi saansadon ne endie sarkaar ke khilaaf vot diya
 The government fell by one vote
 mayawati ne khushi jaahir karte hue press se kaha, maine jaan boojhkar bijepi ko murkh bana diya

 1999 main hi sonia ne tay kar liya tha, manmohan honge congress ke piem1999 main jab atal sarkaar ek vot se vishwasamat haar gai, to gend vipaksh ke paale main ai
 Sonia Gandhi stepped up efforts to form the government
 aakhir main samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne is par vito kar diya or desh main madhyavadhi chunaav hue
 But interestingly, till now most people believed that Sonia was in a hurry to become Prime Minister at that time
 kaha jaataa he ki sonia ne raashtrapati keaar narayanan ko samarthan patr kii suchi or sarkaar banane kaa daawa, donon saunp die the
 But Sonia Gandhi herself did not want to become Prime Minister if President Narayanan agreed
 unhone narayanan se kaha tha ki agar gathbandhan bahumat ke liye jaruri aankada juta letaa he, to vah manmohan singh ko shapath dilava den
 That is, Sonia had decided to sit Manmohan on the throne, not in 2004, but five years before that
 shaayad isi ranneeti ke tahat 1999 main manmohan singh ko pehali or aakhri baar loksabhaa chunaav ladvaya gaya
 However, on the South Delhi seat, he lost the election to bjp's Vijay Kumar Malhotra by 30,000 votes
 westland publication se aior angreji main likhi gai yah kitaab darasal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan vir sanghavi dwaara kiye gaye ek tivi sho kaa biproduct he
 According to Sanghvi, during the research of the show, i found that the new generation does not know much about many important stages of Indian politics
 isi ko dhyaan main rakhte hue yah kitaab likhi gai
 It contains details and analysis of elections from 1971 to 2009
 isamen sanghavi ne paaramparik aankadon kii baazeegari ke bajaay un chunaavon ke ahm kirdaaron, ghatnaon or rujhaanon par baat kii he
 Those who watch Indian politics closely
 unke liye kitaab main zyada kuch nayaa nahin he
 If you have read the autobiographies and books of the characters of VP Singh, Natwar Singh, Sanjay Baru, RD Pradhan, PC Alexander and many other Lutyens of Delhi, you will know many stories
 magar jaisaa ki sanghavi ne khud kaha, meraa iraadaa raajnneeti shaastra main ek nai bahes shuru karne or bade bade khulaase karne se zyada is peedi ko saral bhashaa main bhartiya chunaav kaa rup rang or usee kram main bhartiya raajnneeti par ek najariya muhaiyaa karaane kaa he
 The language of the book is simple
 tarika rochak or aakaar aisa ki ek yaa do baar kii reeding main hi puri pard lee jaae

 Generally, you have seen ministers handling suits in suits or in kurta pajamas
 lekin, chhattisgarh ke shram mantri bhaiya laal rajavaade in dinon tauliya or baniyine pahan kar kaamkaaj nipataate najar aa rahe hai
 The minister is wearing it with a hobby or, knowing the weather, know the same
 lekin, mahila afasaron ko mantri ji kaa ye andaaj bilkul nahin bha rahaa he
 Sometimes they have to turn their eyes and on many occasions they have to cover their face with shame
 garmi kii vajah se mantri ji ne badali veshbhusha, yaa phir maamla kuch aurain dinon laal tauliya qamar main baandhe or safed baniyaan pahane mantri ji kaa ek photo viral ho gaya he
 The minister was observing the complaint letters under the Lok Suraj campaign in his bungalow
 aalaa afasaron se unki mulaakaat kaa vakt mukarrar tha
 The officer arrived at the bungalow but after seeing the minister holding the briefs, he was overwhelmed
 pehle to unhen laga ki wo jaldi aa gaye, shaayad mantri ji nityakriya se abhi-abhi laute hai
 Maybe now they will take a shower and then there will be a meeting
 lekin, aisa kuch nahin hua
 Seeing this way of the minister, Sharma is shocked to see the women officers, and the minister froze on the chair, then the consultation started with complaints and their visits
 is dauraan mantri ji kii chahalkadami dekh kar kai mahila afasar jhenp bhi gayi
 However, this did not have any effect on the minister, he continued to handle the work with carelessness
 haa ye jarur hua ki isi dauraan kisi shaks ne mobile se mantri kii tasviir khinch lee
 On seeing this, she went viral on social media

 jaisaa kii garuda puraana main bataaya gaya he ki jiske nakhun pile hote hai uske bhagya main bacchon kaa sukh nahin hota
 If there are spots on the nails and the nails are not good in appearance, then such a person does not make much progress in life
 inaki aarthik sthiti saamaanya hoti he
 Nails curved and line lined indicate an economically unfavorable condition
 nakhun par ardhachandrahatheli kii anguliyon ke nakhunon par drushti daalen to nakhun ke bich ardhchandra dikhaai dete hai
 There is more or less than anyone or none
 ye chinh kabhi bhi sthaayee na hokar samyaanusaar badhate ghatate rahete hai

 use bhavishya main maan-sammaan avashya miltaa he
 It is also fruitful to have a crescent in the middle nail at most
 jin logon ke nakhun chote hote hai, ve chaahe kitne bhi ucch va sabhy gharaane main paidaa hue hon, samudr shaastra ke anusaar achche swabhaav ke nahin hote hai
 Such people are rude and selfish
 ye apana hit saadhane ke liye kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 People with crooked and abnormal nails should also be avoided

 Such people are addicted to drugs
 chote nakhun va ganthdaar ungliyaan hon to aise log apane life partner ko ishaaron par nachaate hai
 Although these are good characters, they cannot be completely believed
 kathor nakhun vaale vyakti jhagadalu pravriti ke saath hi apni jid ke pakke hote hai
 Those who make a decision, they take power only
 chaahe ve phir sahi ho yaa galat
 They don't care about anything
 ghar main kachua rakhane ke hai ye labhve log jinke nakhun chaudaai se adhik lambaai liye hon to aise log nirantar aage badhane vaale hote hai
 They progress a lot in their lives
 ye apane kartavyon ko acchhee tarah samajhate va ise puraa bhi karte hai
 It is considered good to have a white scar on the first finger nail
 isamen ye ishaara hota he ki aapako soche hue kaam main phayda milane vaala he
 White stains on the thumb nails indicate success in love, but sometimes these white stains are also a sign of disgrace
 agar aapke haath kii ungali ke nakhun kii jad main chandramaa jaisaa aakaar bane to aapako achaanak dhan laabh hone ke bhi yoga banenge
 Additionally, you will also benefit from machinery

 haalanki agar pakistan ne kashmir maamle ko antarrashtriya nyaayalay main le jane kii koshish kii to bharat kaa kaam aasaan ho jayega
 After this, Pakistan will also have to evacuate pok
 pakistan ke kanoon mantralay ne imran khan ko naseehat di he ki vah kashmir maamle ko antarrashtriya nyaayalay main le jane kii galati na karen
 Pakistan also knows well that if it tries to take the Kashmir case to the International Court of Justice, it will have to lose its hands with the pok
 isaki vajah yah he ki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne 21 april 1948 ko ek rijolution paarit kiya tha, jisamen suraksha parishad ne pakistan ko pioke khaali karne or sena ko waapas bulaane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 Apart from this, the Security Council also directed to merge pok in Jammu and Kashmir
 ab kashmir ke masale par british saansad bob bluecoman ne khulkar bharat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Referring to the resolution of 21 April 1948, he said that the entire Jammu and Kashmir including Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) is an integral part of India
 suraksha parishad ne bhi apane pehle rijolution main mana tha ki pioke samet puraa jammu-kashmir bharat kaa hissaa he
 At the same time, the Security Council had asked the Pakistan Army and civilians to evacuate pok
 lihaaja pakistan ko pioke khaali karnaa chahie
 The British MP said that those who talk of following the UN Security Council resolution on Jammu and Kashmir are ignoring the earlier resolution of the UN Security Council
 supreme court baar association kii upaadhyaksh jitendra mohan sharma kaa kahana he ki anuchhed 370 hatane ke baad pioke samet puraa jammu kashmir bharat kaa centre shasit pradesh ban chukaa he
 Now Pakistan has no legal rights of any kind on pok
 anuchhed 370 ko hataane kaa modi sarkaar ke faisle se antarrashtriya str par bhi bharat kaa paksh kai guna majboot ho gaya he
 Apart from this, Supreme Court Advocate Upendra Mishra says that if Pakistan is able to take the Kashmir issue to the UN Security Council or the International Court of Justice, then it will have to face it because legally India's side is very strong
 
 kashmir masale par sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad or antarrashtriya nyaayalay pakistan ko sabase pehle pioke khaali karne ko kahenge, kyonki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad apane pehle rijolution main pakistan ko nirdesh de chukaa he ki wo pioke khaali karen
 This will make India's work easier
 supreme court ke edwocket upendra mishra kaa kahana he ki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne bharat kii shikaayat par hi pakistan ko pioke khaali karne kaa nirdesh diya tha
 However, Pakistan has not yet implemented the resolution of the United Nations Security Council
 lekin usko ek naa ek din pioke khaali karnaa padegaa
 Pakistan has illegally captured pok, India has already been saying that Pakistan pok is an integral part of it and Pakistan should vacate it
 haal hi main kendriya rakshaamantri rajnath singh bhi kah chuke hai ki pakistan adhikrut kashmir (pioke) bharat kaa abhinn hissaa he
 Now if we talk to Pakistan, it will be only on pok
 bharat shuru se hi kahata aa rahaa he ki pakistan ne jammu-kashmir par avaidh kabja kar rakhaa he
 Pakistan will have to evacuate pok
 suraksha parishad main munh kii kha chukaa he pakistanjammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane ke baad se pakistan baukhalaayaa hua he
 Pakistan first threatened war and then called a closed door meeting of the United Nations Security Council including China
 haalanki is baithak main pakistan ko china ke alaava kisi desh kaa saath nahin mila
 After this, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi spoke of taking the Kashmir case to the International Court of Justice, but they were advised by the Law Ministry of Pakistan that if it was a mistake to take the case to the International Court, then it would be flawed
 Will have to suffer

 He said that this attitude of the Mayawati government proves that the BSP supremo aspires to become Prime Minister by taking votes for the upper castes but does not want to do anything in their interest

 ghurne main ausatan pratidin 43 mintevaigyanikon ne in sawaalon ke jawaab talash liye hai ki ek insaan kisi aadki ko ghurne main, ankhen fadkar dekhne main kitna vakt qurbaan karata he
 Every single result of a British research is shocking
 british sanstha kodaik lens vijan ne 18 se 50 kii umr ke 3000 logon kii raay ko aadhaar banaakar jo anusandhan kiye hai uske mutabik purush apni jindagi kaa puraa ek saal ladakiyon ko ghurne par qurbaan kar detaa he
 Throughout the day, an average person stares at not one, not 2, but 10 different girls
 pratidin purush do-chaar minute nahin balki ausatan puraa 43 minute ladakiyon yaa mahilaon ko mud-mudakar ghurne par yaa aankhe fadkar nihaarne par kharch karata he
 If you are not able to quit even if you have been thinking till now that girls are staring at men, or mentally deformed people stare at girls in the square, square, market, park or office, then change your mind Are needed
 british research se to yahi sabit hota he ki har insaan main vipareet sex ko ghurne kii fitrat hoti he
 a person does not give up the habit of staring even after wishing
 ghurne main ladkiyaan bhi peeche nahibgar aap samajhate rahe hai ki ladkiyaan wo kaam nahin karatin, jo ladke karte hai to yah galat he
 Girls are also joining the boys step by step in this
 ladakon kii tarah ladakiyon ko bhi vipareet sex ko ghoorna acha lagata he
 Girls are also not behind in staring at boys, keeping eyes in their eyes, keeping eyes in their eyes till they disappear
 akeli hone par ladkiyaan beshak chorichupe ladakon ko ghurne kaa yaa najaron main nazren gadaane kaa khel kam khele, magar hamaumr saathiyon kii maujuudagi main ladkiyaan bhi utani hi dhithpan se najaron kaa khel khelti hai jitani kii ladke
 Girls give research in the life of the 6-month-old British institute Kodak Lens Vision, the results of girls staring at the opposite sex have also revealed eye-opening results
 haalanki ladakon yaa purushon kii tulana main ladakiyon yaa mahilaon main ghurne kii fitrat thodi kam hoti he, lekin ye bhi jindagi kaa acha khaasaa vakt ankhon se ras pine par kharch kar detii hai
 According to research based on the opinion of women between the ages of 18 and 50, girls or women also spend the entire 6 months of their lives staring at the opposite sex on average
 pratidin ladakiyon kii ghurne kii fitrat kii avadhi ausatan 20 minute he
 It is also found in the search in the eyes of 6 boys on average every day, girls or women stare at 6 boys or men on an average every day
 sawaal he ki ladkiyaan aakhir ladakon main kya dekhati hai
 If boys stare at girls then why are they staring? There is also shocking information from research
 najaron kaa khel donon ko hi behad pasand hai, lekin aakarshan kaa centre donon ke liye alag-alag hota he
 The body of girls attracts the attractiveness of girls to girls
 sharir jitna sudaul auki sughad ho, ladakon kii nazren utani der tak ladkee par tiki rahati hai
 But the center of attraction for girls is not the body of boys but something else
 ladakiyon ko ladakon kii ankhen apni ore khinchati hai or ek baar nazren mil jaaen to bas ladkiyaan usamen duubati chali jaati hai
 Girls like to stare at boys themselves
 yahaan tak ki jindagi ke ausatan puure 6 maheene, har din kariban 20 minute wo ladakon ko ghurne par kharch karti hai lekin ladakiyon ko ladakon kaa unhen ghoorna zyada pansad nahin
 In most cases, the girls either stare or feel embarrassed by the staring eyes of the boys
 ghure jane par ghabraati hai ladkiyangar ghurti nazren jism ko bhedanevaali hon to ladkiyaan buree tarah ghabara bhi jaati hai
 But this is not the case with boys
 na sirf ladakon main ghurne kii aadat juyada hoti he, balki ladakiyon kii tulana main ladakon kii pasand bhi ulti he
 When the girls stare at the boys or turn their eyes on them, the boys are very pleased
 sach to ye he ki ladkiyaan jab unhen ghurti hai to ladke apane aap par fakhr mahasoos karte hai or doston main chaudaa hokar ghoomana shuru kar dete hai
 It is clear that for some fun or for recreation, sometimes to show courage in friends or sometimes just to understand the opposite sex, it is such a nature to look around, which is not possible for a human being to leave
 badi hastiyon ko bhi maukey kii talashkhullam-khulla dekhnaa yaa nazren bachaakar dekhnaa aam logon ke liye aasaan he, par wo log kya karte hai jo hai kisi mulk ke raashtrapati hai yaa hai bade khilaadi yaa bade sitare hai? america raashtrapati hossain obama yaa france ke raashtrapati nicholas sarkoji jaise oonche ohade par baithe log kya karte hai? ghurne vaali obama kii karatuut range haath jahaan pakadi gai, wo jagah bhi kam maamuli nahin thi
 The same year, they were found staring at the girls during the conference of G8 countries in Italy, where G8 member countries gathered to debate on big issues such as economic recession, terrorism and eradicating poverty from the world
 
 sarkoji bhi kisi se kam nahiladakiyon ko ghurne kii fitrat se laachaar america ke raashtrapati baraak hossain obama hi nahin hai balki france ke raashtrapati nicholas sarcoji bhi hai
 Obama's eyesight got set, but the French President Sarkozy also did not consider it appropriate to miss the opportunity to stare at the Brazilian delegate who came to attend the G8 conference
 duniya kii kai or jaani maani hastiyaan ankhe bachaakar yaa mauka dekhakar ghurne kii chori pakadi gai hai
 Footballer David Beckham is also one of the eye-witnesses of the American Cheer Girl with slanting eyes
 vipareet sex ko nihaarne kaa anandvipareet sex ko nihaarne main utana hi sukh miltaa he jitna kii bhukhe ko bhojan milane ke baad yaa pyaase ko pani milane ke baad
 The structure of a human being is such that upon seeing the opposite sex, there is a hormonal reaction in the body and there is a wonderful feeling of pleasure
 kuch had tak purushon kaa ek mahila kii taraf yaa mahila kaa purush kii taraf aakarshith hona swaabhaavik mana jaataa he, kahin na kahin iske peeche biologil factors hote hai
 There are hormonal factors, especially within young adulthood
 Hormones are very high inside you
 purushon ke andar jo testosterone naam kaa hormone he, wo kahin naa kahin ek atrection, ek dizator paidaa karata he, jiske chalate kai baar aap duusare sex kii taraf aap zyaada dhyaan dete hai
 It falls on its own, in a similar way, women are also on sexual hormonal peak, due to which some attention is paid towards one sex
 ye wo sukh he jisase koi bhi insaan vanchit nahin rahanaa chahta auki jab kabhi mauka miltaa he insaan kii ankhen khud-ba-khud us ore khichin chali jaati hai

 samaajawaadee party main pichley dedh saal se kinare chal rahe shivpal yadav ne apni bhavishya kii raajnneetik raah chun lee he
 Announcing the formation of the Samajwadi Secular Front, he said that anyone who is not respected in the SP should come with us
 sapa netaaon ko chhodie shivpal ke saath party se nikaale gaye unke 'tridev' bhi is morche ke saath jane kaa abhi faisla nahin kar sake hai
 Please tell that Deepak Mishra, Mo
 shahid or rajesh yadav ko shivpal kaa tridev kaha jaataa he
 The soured relationship between Akhilesh and Shivpal began before the 2017 assembly elections
 iske baad akhilesh ne apane chachaa shivpal ko mantrimandal se baahar kar diya tha
 After Shivpal, Akhilesh's car collapsed at five close quarters including his friend
 akhilesh ne deepak mishra, mo
 Shahid, Rakesh Yadav, Kallu Yadav and Rajesh Yadav were dropped from the party
 ye paanchon netaa sapa se nikaale jane ke baad bhi kisi duusari party main shaamil nahin hue
 Shivpal's 'tridev' was just waiting for the path of reconciliation agreement in the SP clan and he could return to the party again
 ab jab shivpal ne apni raajnneetik raah sapa se alag chun lee he to ye teenon netaa abhi faisla nahin kar paa rahe hai
 The leader close to Shivpal said on the condition of anonymity that the political direction of the Samajwadi Secular Front is not clear yet
 jabaki ham chaahate the ki ye parivaar ek rahe or kisi tarah se samjhauta ho jaae, lekin ye hota nahin dikh rahaa he
 The separation of Shivpal and Akhilesh will not benefit anyone but will result in political loss
 bataa den ki akhilesh yadav ke haath main sapa kii kaman aane ke baad party main kaaphi netaa hai jo puri tarah se kinare kar die gaye hai
 These include leaders close to Shivpal and Mulayam Singh Yadav
 sapa main akhilesh or ramgopal yadavake kareebi netaaon kaa varchasv kaayam he
 After Shivpal's political decision, it is believed that the new base of all these leaders will form a socialist secular front
 lekin jis tarah se samaajawaadee raajnneeti bhavishya akhilesh yadav ke haathon main log dekh rahe hai
 In such a situation, people are shying away from going to Shivpal camp
 jabaki sapa ke sanghathan main ek daur main shivpal kii majboot pakad thi
 There is no district in Uttar Pradesh where Shivpal does not have at least 2 to 4 thousand workers
 darasal shivpal ke morche ke saath na judane se isliye bhi ghabrahat he ki kisi din mulaayam singh yadav ne unhen bulaakar phir samajha diya to phir wo maan jaaenge
 a close aide of Shivpal expressed doubt that if he joined the front now and after a few days he postponed the intention of making it, then the remaining politics would be over
 shivpal ne abhi sapa ko puri tarah se alavida nahin kaha he
 They have just formed a front
 haalanki unhone is morche ko vidhansabha chunaav ke baad hi banaaya tha, jisaki jimmedaari unhone farhat miyaan ko diya tha
 While the state president, Shivpal had handed over the command of the party's minority to Farhat Mian
 akhilesh ne jinhen baad main hataa diya tha

 argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad yadav kii kitaab 'gopalganj tu raisina: maai political jarney' jald aane vaali he
 Lalu has claimed in this book that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar wanted to rejoin the Grand Alliance 6 months after separating from the Grand Alliance
 lekin iske liye wo raji nahin hue
 Lalu Prasad, along with his son and former Bihar Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav, have also claimed that Nitish Kumar wanted to return to the grand alliance
 lalu yadav ne apni is aatmakatha main daawa kiya he ki dobaaraa mahagathbandhan main shaamil hone ke liye nitish kumaar ne apane sahyogi prashanth kishor ko 5 baar unke paas baatcheet ke liye bheja
 But Lalu flatly refused to take Nitish back to the Grand Alliance
 lalu kii is kitaab ko maane to unhone nitish kumaar kii mahagathbandhan main dobaaraa entry par isliye roak laga diya kyonki nitish ne unka bharosa tod diya tha or vah un par dobaaraa vishwaas nahin kar sakate the
 Lalu has said in this book that he had no displeasure with Nitish Kumar, but he was worried about how the people of Bihar would take it if they accepted Nitish Kumar again in Mahagathbandhan by agreeing to Prashant Kishore
 
 lalu ne is kitaab main yah bhi daawa kiya he ki nitish kumaar ko phir se mahagathbandhan main shaamil karaane ke liye prashanth kishor ne unke bete or purv upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav se bhi mulaakaat kii thi
 Prashant Kishore had assured him that if this happens, the Grand Alliance will win big in the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and BJP will be eliminated from these two states
 lalu ke is sansanikhej daavon ko lekar prashanth kishor jo ab jediu ke upaadhyaksh hai ne apni pratikriya dete hue sabhi daavon ko puri tareeke se bogus qaraar diya he
 Prashant Kishore tweeted that Lalu Prasad has made a failed attempt to keep himself in the limelight
 prashanth kishor ne kaha ki lalu ke achche din ab peeche rah gaye hai
 However, Prashant Kishore has admitted in his tweet that he had met Lalu Prasad several times before joining JDU
 lekin unhone is baat kaa khulaasa kiya ki donon ke bich is dauraan kya-kya baaten hui to isse lalu prasad yadav ko kaaphi sharmindagi mahasoos hogi
 Significantly, in 2017, after the allegations of corruption against Tejashwi Yadav, Nitish Kumar broke away from the Grand Alliance and formed a new government with the BJP

 Referring to the achievements of the bjp-led NDA government, which had been in power at the Center for six years under the leadership of Atal Bihari Bajpayee, Singh said that inflation is continuously under control in the NDA government, but after the formation of the Congress-led UPA government, inflation increases wildly
 And cases of corruption are being exposed
 singh ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main bhaajapa kii sarkaar banane par kisaanon ke ek lakh rape tak ke krishi karj ko maaf kar diye jane or ek pratishat byaaj par krishi karj kii vyavastha kiye jane kaa vaada doharaaya
 Earlier, while addressing a public meeting in Katehari assembly constituency of Ambedkar Nagar, Singh said that the commission for the investigation of the disproportionate assets and corruption cases of the Chief Minister Mayawati and former Chief Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav when the BJP came to power

 On this basis, the petitioner had demanded 2 Lok Sabha seats in lieu of 24 assembly seats

 Pakistan also gave up its position after India presented its case in a hearing in the International Arbitration (international Court of Justice or International Court of Justice or ICJ) in The Hague on the issue of execution of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian national, by the Pakistani military court
 Has given the answer pakistan ne kaha he ki is maamle main jadhav kaa kaboolnamaa sunanaa jaruri he
 Pakistan accused the international court of being the theater of politics
 padhein pakistan ne isije main or kya kaha
 
 
 Jadhav's confession required to be heard - ise raajnneeti kaa rangamanch na banaae bharat - India is using the international court politically - ham maamle ke shantipurna hal ke liye patibaddh hai, chaahe hame jitna bhi uksaane kii koshish kii jaae - Talk about Jadhav's passport India - darshak tay kar sakate hai ki jadhav swechha se kabool kar rahaa he yaa nahin - Pakistan gave 150 days time after conviction - is maamle main hoicourt dwaara yachika kii maang karne kii koi sambhaavna nahin he - People have been getting relief from the courts of Pakistan in the past - pakistan padosiyon ke saath shantipurna tareeke se rahanaa chahta he - We have no desire to waste the time and resources of the court to equalize the political parties - bhartiya media ne antarrashtriya adaalat ke patr ko 'roak' ke rup main dikhaaya he jo ki nahin he
 This is a way to deviate from the facts - baluchistan main jadhav ko giraftaar kiya gaya - Muslim name in Jadhav's passport - ye argency kaa maamla nahin - Kulbhushan Jadhav is not eligible for councilor access - jadhav kaa kaboolnamaa sunanaa jaruri India should not make it the theater of politics - antarrashtriya adaalat kaa raajnneetik istemaal kar rahaa he bharat - We are committed to a peaceful resolution of the matter, no matter how much we try to provoke - jadhav ke passport kii baat kare bharat - Viewers can decide whether Jadhav is volunteering or not - pakistan ne sajaa ke baad 150 din kaa samay diya - There is no possibility of seeking a petition by the High Court in this case - logon ko ateet main pakistan kii adaalaton se raahat milti rahi he - Pakistan wants to live peacefully with neighbors - raajnneetik dalon ke hisaab baraabar karne ke liye adaalat kaa samay or sansaadhan barbaad karne kii hamaari koi ichha nahin he - Indian media has shown the international court letter as a 'ban' which is not
 yah ek tarah se tathyon se bhatkaana he - Jadhav arrested in Balochistan - jadhav ke passport main muslim naam - This is not a matter of emergency - counciller pahunch ke liye yogya nahin he kulbhushan jadhav Krishnaraj Rai, father of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, died on Saturday afternoon

 rail mantri mukul raay ke lambe-lambe samay tak mantralay se gaayab rahane ke maddenjar vibhageeya adhikariyon ko railway kii suraksha ko lekar chintaa sata rahi he
 Officials say important decisions have been delayed due to his absence
 rail mantralay ko aam taur par trinmul congress ke liye surakshit samajha ja rahaa he
 Earlier, Mamata Banerjee was the head of Trinamool Congress itself
 unke baad dinesh trivedi rahe or ab mukul raay bhi trinmul congress party se hi hai
 a former Railway Board chairman said, 'the absence of a minister leads to a wrong message
 yah puure network ko baadhit karata he
 'many former board officials held similar views
 unhone kaha ki railway desh kii jivan rekha he or ise remote control se nahin chalaaya ja saktaa he, kyonki ise grih mantralay or pradhanmantri awaas jaise mahatvapurn mantralayon ke saath taal mail banaakar chalanaa hota he
 Rai took charge of the ministry on March 20 and since then he has been missing from the ministry for a long time, like his predecessor Banerjee
 aisa isliye he kyonki vah party main duusare nambar par hai
 According to an Railway Ministry official, like Banerjee, important documents are sent to Kolkata for Rai's approval
 anupasthit rahane ke kaaran raay kai mantrimandaleey baithak main shaamil nahin rah paae
 He was also unable to attend the meeting of the Empowered Group of Ministers on July 31 on the drought
 purv mantrimandaleey sachiv naresh chandra ne kaha, "is sthiti ke liye banerjee jimmedaar hai
 If he nominated Rai as the railway minister, it is his fault
 'unhone kaha ki saidhantik rup se dastavej ko kolkata bhejne main kuch bhi galat nahin he, lekin mantralay se anupasthit rahane kaa matlab jimmedaari kii bhaavana kaa abhaav mana ja saktaa he

 Many faces have turned black in the coal scam, but now the kind of rapture that CBI is showing is beyond comprehension
 mana ki is jaanch agency ko supreme court ne swatantra rup se bade se bada kadam uthaane kaa nirdesh de diya he, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki vah utsaah main kuch aisa kar jaae, jisase desh main nivesh ko dhakka lage or vyapaarik centement ko chot pahunche
 Right now the CBI investigation is going on in the coal scam and many things have to be known, but before that it has filed another FIR
 iske baad tatkaaleen koyala sachiv pisi parakh ne kaha ki agar kolgate main aaropee hum, to pradhanmantri kaa naam bhi isamen shumaar hona chahie
 Your favorite website till date has sought votes from the public on whether the name of the Prime Minister should be included in it or the then coal secretary is saying it wrong
 iske nattejey behad chaunkaane vaale rahe
 95
 3 pratishat logon ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kaa naam bhi isamen shumaar hona chahie, jabaki mahaj 4
 7 percent said the former coal secretary is misinformed
 yah nateeja apane aap bahut si baaten kah rahaa he
 First of all, it became clear that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's immaculate image has now been tarnished and secondly he is losing the trust of the people of the country
 janata kii voting isliye bhi myne rakhti he ki purv koyala sachiv ko bahut kam log jaanate hai or vah koi raajnneetik netaa bhi nahin hai
 Such strong support of his statement shows that the importance of the government's statements in the public is now over
 yah sach he or jaruri bhi he ki sarkari tendering main paardarshita ho or sab kuch puri tarah recorded ho, kyonki isse hi desh main bhrashtachar par ankush lag sakegaa
 The way our readers have in one voice agreed with the then Secretary PC Parakh in the coal scam case that the Prime Minister should also be accused in this case, it seems that this step of the CBI is wrong
 itani badi sankhya main pathakon kaa parakh ko samarthan dena is baat kaa suchak he ki is maamle main sibiai se chook hui he

 (input bhashaa se) Congress President Rahul Gandhi gave many such information in the meeting of Congress Working Committee, which surprised many leaders present in the meeting
 rahul gandhi ne kuch netaaon par ishaara karte hue kaha ki kuch netaa apane beton ko hi tikat dilaane ke dabaav daalate rahe
 Rahul said that a leader even said that if his son does not get the ticket, he can consider leaving the party
 rahul gandhi ne kaarysmiti kii baithak main kaha ki gandhi parivaar ke alaava bhi yadi koi party kii adhyakshata kar saktaa he unhen isamen koi diqqat nahin he
 But many senior leaders such as Drs
 manmohan singh, ahamed patel, eke antni or ghulaam nabi azaad ne unhen aisa karne se roka
 But Rahul Gandhi is adamant about his resignation and says that he has given his opinion on the party thoughtfully and the party should also consider it with an open mind
 congress kaarysmiti kii baithak main rahul kii team ke kilaaf bhi kuch baaten kahin gai
 Some members pointed out that Rahul's team consists of educated people from Oxford and Howard, even though he is highly qualified but he is not other political people
 
 The people apparently pointed towards Sam Pitroda
 logon kaa maananaa he ki 1984 ke sikh dangon par die gaye bayaan 'hua to hua' se congress ko kaaphi nuksaan hua he
 Rahul Gandhi was also advised to include political savvy in his team, which would lead to team balance and ease in taking political decisions
 jab rahul gandhi apane istife kii baat kah rahe the tab sabaki nazaren sonia gandhi par gai jo us baithak main maujuud thim magar sonia gandhi ne koi jawaab nahin diya kisi bhi tarah kii dilchaspee nahin dikhaai
 But Uttar Pradesh General Secretary in-charge Priyanka Gandhi said that if Rahul Gandhi resigns, it would be like falling into the BJP trap unilaterally because that's what the BJP wants
 lekin sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki kya rahul gandhi congress main bada badlaav kar sakate hai
 The responsibility of defeat can be given to the Chief Ministers of those states where Congress account is not open or they have got one or two seats
 in rajyon main disambar main hi congress ne itnaa acha pradarshan kiya tha or apni sarkaar banaai
 What has changed here in 4 months due to which the party has either not opened its account in the Lok Sabha elections or has got 1 or 2 seats
 sawaal is baat kaa he ki kya mukhyamantri isaki zimmedaari lene ke liye taiyaar hai yaa phir unke paas iskaa koi jawaab he
 The Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh did not even come to the meeting of the Working Committee, pretending that he had called a meeting of the Legislature Party there, so it is necessary for him to stay in Bhopal because the BJP is engaged in further stabilizing his government
 kaary samiti kii baithak main kai varisht netaaon ne rahul gandhi ko yah samajhane kii koshish kii ki yah party kii pehali haar nahin he isse pehle bhi indira gandhi se lekar ke baaqi congress adhyakshon ke jamaane main bhi party ko aisi hi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 But it needs to be dealt with a new strategy because now the time has changed a lot and the party needs to change at the same time
 suzav yah bhi aayaa ki party main coder kaise banaaya jaae seva dal kaa kya role ho, yuvaaon main congress kii nitiyon ko lekar kaise bharosa paidaa kiya jaae
 It was also said that the Congress's plan of justice was for which the party had failed to reach its point
 ab in sab chizon ke bich rahul gandhi ke liye kii zimmedaari kaafii bad jaati he ki vah kya nae badlaav karte hai
 There will be coordination between the youth and the elderly in the party and how the common people will be accommodated by connecting the youth with experience
 kya kerala ke netaaon or punjab ke mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ke anubhavon kaa bhi laabh liya jayega
 Will Rahul Gandhi try to meet him and get some tips as to why the issue that was going on for the BJP across the country could not work in Punjab
 kya rahul stallin ke paas jaaenge ki DMK ne kis tarah se tamilnadu main aiadmkora BJP gathbandhan ko khatm kar diya
 But all eyes will be on what kind of reshuffle Rahul does in the coming days and whether Priyanka Gandhi's role increases or is limited to Uttar Pradesh
 yahi nahin congress kii nitiyaan kya hogin saath hi party ko sahi maukey or mudde kaa intjaar karnaa hoga jaise ki indira gandhi ne belchhi cond kaa kiya tha
 At the same time, Rahul will also have to give confidence and comfort to his allies, especially rjd's Tejashwi Yadav and also talk to Kumaraswamy in Karnataka that there is no threat to his government
 rahul ko aisi team banani hogi jo nae josh se kaam kar sake
 Hilary Koprowski, the great scientist who invented the vaccine to eliminate polio, died
 vah 96 varsh ke the
 The injection of the polio vaccine was discovered by scientist Jonas Sock two years after Koprowski discovered the drinking polio vaccine
 coprovski ne jivit polio vishaanu kaa prayog kar polio vaxin ko viksit kiya tha jise manushya par pehali baar 1950 main prayog kiya gaya
 Koprowski's son Christopher stated that the vaccine developed by his father was the first drug to succeed in controlling polio
 iske baad hi sock ne polio vaxin ke injection kii khoj kii tathaa vaigyanik albert sabin ko pehali baar america main polio vaxin ke liye license pradaan kiya gaya
 Koprowski's son said that but his father was more than happy with the scientific recognition his discovery had given to the popularity of his research colleagues
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne rus ke daure par kaha he ki kudankulam newclear power project bilkul thik raah par aage bad rahaa he
 He assured the Russian leaders in Moscow on Friday about this
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki kudankulam plant kaa pehla riector kuch saptaah ke bheetar kaam karne lagegaa
 He said that a time limit of 6 months has been set for starting the work of the second reactor
 pradhanmantri kaa yah bayaan aise samay main aayaa he, jab tamilnadu ke is project kaa sthaneey nivasee suraksha kaarnon se purajor virodh kar rahe hai
 The locals are concerned that if a tsunami and earthquake like Fukushima of Japan occur in India, the reactor could prove fatal
 gauratlab he ki sunami or bukamp ne japan ke phukushima sthit parmaanu riector ko baari kshati pahunchaai thi or haadason main kai logon kii jaan chali gai thi
 Former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa said that even though regional parties have failed in Karnataka in the past, their new party, Karnataka Janata Party, to be formed next month, will play an important role in the changed political scenario
 yediurppa ne kaha ki haalanki karnataka main purv main kshetreey partiyaan, astitv banaae rakhane main vifal rahi hai lekin karnataka janata party, rajya main badale raajnneetik paridrishy main mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa karegi
 Yeddyurappa has already announced that he will form the KJP on December 9 after resigning from the BJP

 During the second match, there was an incident which decided that the real boss behind the car stump is Mahendra Singh Dhoni

 dhoni ne gend pakad kar kuch der haath main rakhi, phir stump kiya
 It seemed as if Dhoni was teasing the holder

 The message from the bankers came last evening
 credit card kaa billjama karne ke liye
 Bill?
 
 
 dimag par kaaphi jor daalane ke baavjood yaad nahin aayaa ki haal-philhal main credit card se kya kharida tha
 Tired up and got a call to Customer Care
 unhone bataaya ki ye billdansal or kuch nahin, balki 'anual mentinence charge' he
 But while giving the credit card, it was said from the bank that there is no annual charge etc
 
 Why then? On this, the Customer Care Representative said that only a certain amount of money is purchased within a year, not an annual charge
 maine dobaaraa yaad karne kii koshish kii
 Remember that while giving the card, it was not even mentioned by the bank
 nahin sar, wo hamaari policy he, riprogentative ne kaha
 Well, i hung up in anger
 phir yaad aayaa ki anual charge hi kyon
 
 
 Banks are also charging money from customers for not keeping minimum balance and closing the account
 phir tamaam 'hiden' chargeej ko to chhod hi den
 And public sector banks (government banks) are beating private banks in this matter
 kuch dinon pehle hi khabar iki saarvajanik kshetra ke 21 bainkon or nijee kshetra ke teen pramukh baikon ne vitt varsh 2017-18 ke dauraan khate main sirf nunatam raashi na rakh paane kii vajah se graahakon se 5,000 karod rupee se zyada vasuul liye
 You will be shocked to know that out of this, State Bank of India (SBI) alone 2,433
 87 karod rupee vasule
 Now look at another data
 neerav modi or unke mamaa mehul chokasee kaa 'shikaar' hue pienbi ne sirf acount closer yani khaataa band karwaane ke naam par pichley chaar vittiya varshon ke dauraan logon se 207 karod rupee anth liye
 In this way, the amount (forcibly) recovered by all banks in different non-genuine items is thousands of crores of rupees
 hamaara-aapkaa hajaaron karod rupee
 Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi, Vijay Mallya
 
 
 or aise tamaam naam
 There was a lot of chaos when these people were trying to hit the banks with thousands of crores of rupees, but has the situation really changed
 jaraa ek or data par najar daaliye
 According to the RBI, in the last financial year, banks lost fraud worth Rs 41,167 crore
 jabaki, vartmaan vittiya varsh kii pehali chamahi ke dauraan hi bainkon ko 23 hajaar karod rupee se adhik kaa chuunaa lag chukaa he
 Let's go back a little more
 pichley maheene ek sawaal ke jawaab main sarkaar ne bataaya ki pichley chaar varshon ke dauraan dhokhadhadi se sambandhit kul 19102 shikaayatein ain or 1 lakh 14 hajaar 221 karod rupee isaki bhent chadh gaye
 This is not a small amount of money
 iske baavjood bank frod rokane ke liye koi thos kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 Take the example of Punjab National Bank
 neerav modi and company kii badaulat pienbi doobane kii kagaar par aa gaya, lekin iske baavjood bank ne koi sabak nahin siikhaa
 As a result, in the first half of the current financial year i
e
 2018-19, more than 1500 crore rupees of PNB fraudulent offers
 yani baikon kaa puraa dhyaan frod rokane se kahin zyada graahakon ko alag-alag tareeke se 'thagne' par he
 Fraud has become common in atms these days, but the fact is that, "we do not deploy any security guards etc
 in atms
" 
 
 aisi koi policy nahin he''
 This is the answer of PNB, even though 4 of its customers in the first half of the current financial year
 45 karod rupee thag liye gaye hon

 Here the politics of backward classes is taking a new turn
 vidhansabha chunaav kaa saamana karne ja rahe bihar main rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ke netaa lalu prasad yadav pichde voton kii golbandi main jute hai
 Lalu has opened a front against the ruling BJP at the Center, demanding the release of OBC figures in the socio-economic and caste-based census
 sarkaar ne bhale hi ab tak aankade jari na kiye hon, lekin bihar se sate uttar pradesh main panchayat chunaav se pehle hue rapid survey main nikalakar aae obisi aabaadi ke aankadon ne rajnatik tapish ko badha diya he
 These figures, prepared for the first time since 2005 (see chart), indicate that the backward class will be the key to victory in the likely panchayat elections in October

 33 per cent, which is 0 from the calculation made in 2004-05

 Out of 75 districts of UP, OBC population is more than 50 percent in 51 and in 14 it has crossed 60 percent

 12 fisadi se batchqar 53
 Dalit population has been reduced to 33 percent

 The BSP will oppose it at all levels

 panchayat raaj vibhaag ke nideshak udaiveer singh yadav kehete hai, ‘‘kuch dalit jatiyon ke janajati varg main shaamil ho jane ke kaaran hi anusuchit jati (essi) kii jansankhya main kami ai he

 Reservation will be available at 57 percent

 The high-profile candidate from an assembly seat in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, struck a deal with a senior leader of the opposition party
 virdohi dal ke hi paanch netaaon ke naam die gaye, jinamein se do ko kisi bhi surat main tikat nahin dene or baaki teen main se kisi ko bhi dene kii baat hui
 This is such a formula of election management, which cannot be expected in the least of the national party
 lekin chhattisgarh main is tarah ke rajnatik khel behad aam hai
 a similar formula was adopted in the 2014 Antagarh Assembly by-election
 congress ummidavaar manturam pavaar (ab bijepi ke sadsy) ne aise samay main apana naam waapas le liya jab party koi doosraa ummidavaar ghoshit nahin kar sakati thi
 The political deal revealed was revealed in late December 2015 after an audio tape went public
 isamen kathith taur par mukhyamantri raman singh ke damaad punit gupta, purv mukhyamantri ajit jogi, unke bete amit jogi, manturam pavaar or bicheliye firoz siddiki kii baatcheet record he
 In this tape, resentment is being expressed for not getting the full amount as per the transaction and promise to withdraw the name clearly
 congress ne fouran amit jogi ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya to ajit jogi ke khilaaf karrwai kii sifarish alaakaman ko bhej di he
 Despite this, the discord of the Congress does not seem to be diminishing
 jisaki badi vajah ajit jogi kaa janaadhar or unki sadhi hui ranneetik sooyeeboojh he
 In such a situation, the question arises that can the Congress high command be denied power for three times and show courage to oust Jogi family from the party? Kept looking pradesh congress adhyaksh bhupesh baghel ne jogi ko patkani dene kii lagaataar koshish kii
 But he could not foresee Jogi's move
 sutron ke mutabik, antagarh upachunaav ke maamle main jogi ne ranneeti ke tahat pehle manturam ko tikat nahin dene kaa suzav diya, jabaki manturam unke sabase vishwast the
 In such a situation, Baghel felt that if he was given a ticket to Manturam, then Jogi would break the camp
 lekin jogi kheme kii ranneeti se baghel patkani kha gaye
 In money transactions, the promise tape was made public
 india today se baatcheet main purv mukhyamantri jogi kehete hai, “ek or tepe saamne aayaa he, jisamen baghel or firoz kii baatcheet he
 In it, preparations were made to make this tape (manturam Wala)
 ” congress se nishkasit karne kii sifarish par ve kehete hai, “jis ped par zyada fal hota he, usee par log pathar maarthe hai
 Those who could not face me politically directly, they are making fake tapes as weapons
 mujhase abhi tak dilli ne poochtacha nahin kii he
 Baghel reached Delhi and spoke
 rajya congress ke prabharee mahasachiv bi
 K
 hariprasad kehete hai, “pradesh adhyaksh or netaaon ne apni baat upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi or anushaasan cameti ke saamne rakhi he
 We will plan ahead after dealing with the internal battle
 ”jogi-raman ke rishtechhattisgarh main yah aam dharna he ki raman sarkaar kii hetric ke peeche jogi dhade kii ahm bhoomika he
 This belief has its background behind it
 1996 main avibhajit madhya pradesh ke samay se hi adivasee nahin hone kaa maamla bijepi uthaati rahi he
 When Chhattisgarh became the state and Jogi became the first chief minister, the BJP made the election issue of fake Adivasis a chief minister
 tab anusuchit janajati ayog main shikaayat hui or 2001 main ai report main kaha gaya ki jogi kii jati adivasee nahin he
 But Jogi took a stay from the High Court
 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav main phir yah mudda bana or bijepi satta main aa gai
 Even then Jogi tried to sell the mlas, but the tape was revealed and Congress suspended Jogi
 phir raman sarkaar ne bhi hycourt main vahi halafanama daakhil kiya jo jogi sarkaar ke samay daakhil kiya gaya tha
 However, after Jogi's wife Renu Jogi became a candidate in the by-election for Kota Assembly, the Raman government hurriedly filed another affidavit stating that Jogi is not from tribal society
 aktubar 2011 main supreme court ne jogi kii jati kii jaanch ucch adhikaar praapt cameti se karaane kaa aadesh diya, jo 90 din main puri honi thi
 But the committee formed the Vigilance Committee, whose report also came against Jogi in 2013
 disambar 2013 main raman sarkaar ne visilence report waapas le lee
 This was seen as a bargain with Jogi
 is maamle main yachika daayar karne vaale bijepi anusuchit janajati morche kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy sant kumaar netaam aarope lagaate hai, “raman singh or jogi kii santhganth he isliye jogi ko bachaaya ja rahaa he
 "they are also accusing their own government of harassment
 netaam ke mutabik, unki patni ira ko balika chatravaas kii adhikshika pad se hataa diya gaya he, jiske khilaaf ve jald hi adaalat kaa darwaja khatkhataayenge
 However, both Jogi and BJP dismiss the allegations of nexus
 jogi kehete hai, “raman parivaar se saamaanya shishtachar kaa rishta he, rajnatik rup se ve hamaare sabase bade shatru hai
 When i got robotic legs for Rs 1 crore
 main kharida tab mukhyamantri ne bhugtan karaane kaa vaada kiya tha, lekin nahin diya jisase mujh par karj chadh gaya he
 But BJP state president Dharam Lal Kaushik says, "this is an internal battle of the Congress which has nothing to do with the BJP organization and the government
" ”mushkil main bijepicongress main bhale is tepe cond ke baad grih yuddh chhid gaya ho lekin bijepi philhal dekho or intjaar karo kii mudra main he
 On the other hand Raman's son-in-law Dr
 punit gupta kii kathith sanliptata ne naitikta kii duhai dene vaali bijepi kii mushkilen jarur badha di hai
 According to sources, the central leadership and the Sangh are unhappy with this
 bijepi hameshaa se congress ke khilaaf sonia gandhi ke damaad robert wadra ko mudda banaati rahi he, lekin kamobesh vahi sthiti chhattisgarh main raman ke damaad kii vajah se bijepi ko jhelni pad rahi he
 Amit Jogi, Puneet Jogi and Abhishek are said to have a good relationship
 abhishek or amit ke sakriy raajnneeti main aane ke baad donon siyaasi pariwaron ke bich nazdikiyaan khub badhin
 a BJP leader also believes that the reason for his proximity to Jogi was Raman's political strategy in which he realized that all the allied organizations of the bjp-sangh could not together make the equation favorable to the BJP, so he Jogi Tried to practice
 jogi ko satnami samaaj kaa mana jaataa he, jabaki ve khud ko adivasee hone kaa daawa karte hai or dharm ke lihaaj se isai hai
 This combination further strengthens Jogi's base
 is tepe cond main raman ke damaad kii kathith bhoomika kii vajah se pushti bhi ho rahi he
 Though Kaushik says, "know what Puneet had as a doctor with Jogi, but we believe that Puneet is not a member of BJP, so action is not a matter
" tepe kii vishwasaneeyata bhi abhi sabit nahin hui he
 However, the Congress is demanding that Gupta be suspended
 raman singh or unke damaad lagaataar sampark saadhane ke baavjood puure masale par baatcheet karne se parhez karte rahe
 But those close to the chief minister say that even if Mahasamund won Jogi from the Lok Sabha seat, it would have been said that Raman Singh had won, but why not say so if he lost
 nishchit taur par tepkand congress main varchasv kii ladaai kaa nateeja he, lekin 12 saal main pehali baar raman singh damaad kii vajah se sidhe nishane par hai or congress punit gupta ke khilaaf karrwai ke liye rajyavyapee andolan kaa man bana rahi he

 The shipment of this smartphone from Samsung has also been postponed

 Significantly, at this time, Huawei has been banned completely in America

 As the DMK split from the ruling UPA a few days before the end of the first phase of the budget session of Parliament, the BJP on Friday said that the party is keeping an eye on the government's fragile condition and all options are open, including a no-confidence motion
 party pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne sansad parisar main samvaadadaataaon ke saath baatcheet ke dauraan sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane ke sawaal par kaha, ‘bhaajapa kaa kendriya netritv maujuuda halaat par najar banaaye hue he
 We have all the options open and will take the appropriate decision at the appropriate time
 ’unhone kaha, ‘bhaajapa or desh kii janata chunaav ke liye taiyaar he
 But the government and the CBI are not ready for elections
 ’ hossain ne kaha ki sarkaar ne bajet satr ke pehle charan main raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav ke saath aam bajet, rail bajet or jharkhand kaa bajet jaise mahatvapurn kaary kara liye lekin is dauraan vah apane kuch sahyogiyon se ghiri ai to uske kuch sahyogi dal use chhod gaye

 The results of this study were surprising

 Most of the women liked the pictures (heavy stubble) 10 days after shaving
 iske baad phul beards ko mahilaon ne praathamikta di
 The study said that a good jaw line of men also attracts women
 purushon kii dadhi ko unki umr or paurushatv se bhi jodakar dekha jaataa rahaa he
 According to another study, women prefer bearded men more for long-term relationships because it indicates their social success

 padosi mulk china ko baandh banane kii sanak he lekin haal main uski is dhun ko myanmar main jhatka lag gaya
 Myanmar's vigorous decision to halt the controversial Chinese dam project in its territory has served as a catalyst for many important events, including the first visit by an American foreign minister to Myanmar more than half a century later
 iske baavjood china apane desh or videsh main duniya kaa sabase bada baandh nirmaataa bana hua he
 No country has built more dams than China
 hakeekat to yah he ki china main baandhon kii sankhya duniyabar ke kul baandhon se bhi zyada he
 Before the Communists came to power in 1949, there were only 22 dams in China
 lekin aaj duniyabar ke kareeb 50,000 bade baandhon main se aadhe se zyada china main hi hai
 Large-scale dams have a height of at least 15 meters or their water storage capacity exceeding 3 million cubic meters
 is kamaal kaa matlab he ki china ne 1949 se har roj ausatan ek bada baandh taiyaar kiya
 If all the dams of all sizes are counted then their number in China will cross 85,000
 ek or jabardast tathy yah he ki china baandhon ke niryaat ke maamle main global leader he
 Today its government companies alone are building more dams than all other international dam builders
 kam se kam 37 chini vittiya or korporate sansthaaen vikasshil deshon main 100 se zyada badi baandh pariyojnaon main shaamil hai
 In fact, China's policy of "non-intrusive internal affairs" gives it virtually the license to build dam projects that create flood ravages in other countries and make people homeless
 thik isi tarah vah apane desh main baandhon kii adhikta vaali nadiyon kii bajaae tibet ke pathaar, sikyang, madhya mongolia or manchuriya se nikalne vaali antarrashtriya nadiyon par dhyaan kendrit kar rahaa he
 China argues that its global leader's role in dam exports is "advantage only" for host countries and their companies
 lekin kai pariyojna sthalon se milane vaale sabooton se jaahir hota he ki ve baandh bahut badi keemat vasuulne vaale hai
 The basic level protests at various places in Asia, Africa and South America show that in reality these projects are often provoking anti-china sentiments
 darasal, china duusare deshon main baandh yaa duusari pariyojnaon ke liye zyaadaatar kaamgaar apane desh se le jaataa he-jo 2006 ke uske apane un niyamon ke vipareet he jinamein ''sthaniyakaran'' kii baat kahi gai he-jisase yah bhaavana majboot ho jaati he ki vah shoshan karne vaali harkaton main lipt he
 In some projects, Chinese convicts were used as laborers but the people of very poor and weak country could not resist it
 sabase zyada baandhon vaale desh ke taur par china panbizli ke maamle main duniya kaa sabase bada utpaadak desh ban gaya he
 It has an installed production capacity of more than 170 GW
 lekin antarrashtriya nadiyon par baandh banaakar panbizli paidaa karne kii uski mahatvakanksha kii vajah se lagbhag sabhi padosi deshon ke saath uskaa jal vivaad he, yahaan tak ki uttar korea bhi nahin chuta he
 Broadly speaking, China's hobby of dam construction has led to two major incidents
 pehali, duniyabar ke panbizli upkaran niryaat bazaar main ab chini companiyon kaa varchasv he
 And secondly, because of the increasing dominance of the state-run hydropower industry in China, Beijing is trying its best to get dam projects abroad by lending to other governments at attractive, low interest rates
 haal main usne apane desh main agle dashak ke dauraan pani se judi buniyadi sanrachana main 635 arab dollar nivesh kii yojana banaai he
 Out of this, more than one-third of the money will be spent in building dams, reservoirs and other supply structures
 nadiyon par jarurat se zyada baandh banane or nadiyon tathaa basin kaa pani idhar-udhar karne kii vajah se china kaa echosystem bighad gaya he jisase nadiyaan suukh rahi hai or isaki vajah se bhu-jal kaa dohan jarurat se zyada badhata ja rahaa he
 Its social value is more than this
 pradhanmantri wain jiyabaao ne 2007 main sweekaar kiya tha ki jal pariyojnaon kii khatir 1949 se 2
 29 million people were displaced, more than the population of Australia, Romania or Chile
 uske baad se sarkari taur par or 3,50,000 logon ko visthapit kiya ja chukaa he, jinamein zyaadaatar garib gramin hai
 Thus, according to government data, 1,035 people were forcibly imprisoned every day during the last 62 years for water projects
 beijing mekong, brahmaputra, irtish, illi or aamur jaisi antarrashtriya nadiyon par baandh bana rahaa he
 In such a situation, there is a risk of 'exports' of the same calamities that China's own rivers are struggling with
 vakt aa gaya he ki beijing kii baandh banane kii sanak ko rokane or antarrashtriya paryaavaran ke maanakon ko manwaane ke liye dabaav daalaa jaae

 bhartiya swadhinata sangram main sukhdev thapar ek aisa naam he jo na sirf apni deshbhakti, saahas or mathrubhumi par qurbaan hone ke liye janaa jaataa he, balki shahid e ajam bhagat singh ke anany mitra ke rup main bhi unka naam itihaas main darj he
 Sukhdev, who rocked the British government with his revolutionary activities, was born on 15 May 1907 in the city of Ludhiana, Punjab
 apane bachapan se hi unhone bharat main britania hukumat ke julmon ko dekha or isi ke chalate vah gulaami kii zanjeeron ko todane ke liye krantikari ban gaye
 According to Chaman Lal, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University and who has written several books on revolutionaries, Sukhdev, a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association, was deeply moved by patriotism
 vah lahore ke neshnal college main yuvaaon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharte or unhen swatantraaa andolan main kud padane ke liye prerit karte the
 As a skilled leader, he used to tell the students studying in college about India's glorious past
 unhone anya krantikari saathiyon ke saath milakar lahore main noujvaan bharat sabha shuru kii
 It was an organization that inspired the youth to join the freedom movement
 itihaaskaar malti malik ke anusaar sukhdev ne yuvaaon main na sirf deshbhakti kaa jajba bharne kaa kaam kiya, balki khud bhi krantikari gatividhiyon main sakriy rup se bhaag liya
 His name is known prominently for the incident in 1928 when revolutionaries killed Deputy Superintendent of Police JP Saunders of Ghori government to avenge the death of Lala Lajpat Rai
 is ghatana ne british samrajya ko hilaakar rakh diya tha or puure desh main krantikariyon kii jai jayakaar hui thi
 The murder of Sanders became known as the 'lahore Conspiracy'
 is maamle main raajaguru, sukhdev or bhagat singh ko maut kii sajaa sunai gai
 On 23 March 1931, the three revolutionaries swung to the gallows of laughter and created a new urge to get freedom in the hearts of the youth of the country
 shahadat ke samay sukhdev kii umr maatr 24 saal thi
 Security guard Ramdhani Yadav in light blue uniform is troubled by the increasing presence of police in the Mahabodhi temple
 ravivaar ko ek ke baad ek, das dhamaakon ke baad mandir kii suraksha ke liye bihar military police ke do darjan karmiyon ko dekhakar yadav kaa kahana he, ''ummid he ki ye hamaari naukari nahin lenge
 "ramdhani Yadav of Bela village in Gaya district has spent Rs 4,000 in May this year only after working for several years as Gateman of coal merchant in Dhanbad
 maheene kii yah naukari hasil kii he
 Prior to the blasts, 16 private security guards including 42-year-old Yadav were entrusted with security of the Mahabodhi Temple in a two-shift shift
 yah sabhi sahi dhang se shikshit bhi nahin hai
 The Mahabodhi Temple, a World Heritage Site, has been officially on the list of terrorist attack threats since October 2012
 bodhgaya mandir prabandhak samiti (beatiemasi) ko bodhgaya mandir kanoon 1949 ke tahat mahabodhi mandir ke prabandh kii jimmedaari mili hui he
 He had given the contract for internal security of the temple to a minor private security agency, Cobra
 yadav ko bhartee karte samay cobra ne use vardi or sone kii jagah dene ke saath-saath sailyut karnaa sikhaane ke liye ek din kii training bhi di thi or itani si training ke baad unhen mandir kii bhitari suraksha par tainaat kar diya
 The deployment of security guards with low pay and weak training to protect the Mahabodhi Temple is just one example of how the security structure started from the pinnacle of the Bihar government and the state Home Department, Police Headquarters, Bodh Gaya Police and BTMC Went on collapsing
 ravivaar ko dhamaakon ke kuch ghanton ke baad nitish kumaar jab bodhgaya pahunche to ve jaanate the ki suraksha kaise bhang hui
 He immediately sought protection from CISF
 nitish ne bodhgaya main media se baatcheet main dhamaakon ko suraksha main chook kaa nateeja maanane se inkaar kar diya
 But the question is why they did not demand the deployment of CISF as soon as intelligence was received
 mahabodhi mandir centre sangrakshit smarakon main shaamil nahin he isliye uski suraksha siif ko nahin saunpi gai he
 Apart from this, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) department has no interference in the protection of the temple due to the operation of the temple by BTMC
 bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi kehete hai, ''nitish kumaar kisi or ko dosha nahin de sakate
 Their fault is theirs
 rajya ke grih or paryaton mantri hone ke naate mahabodhi mandir kii suraksha kii jimmedaari mukhyamantri kii he
 Nitish Kumar Sarkar knew beforehand how much the Mahabodhi Temple was in danger and how desperate the Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists were to target it
 akïtubar, 2012 main gaya ke tatkaaleen varisht police adheekshak vinay kumaar ko asad khan, imran khan, said firoz urf hamja or irfan mustafa se poochtacha ke silsile main dilli bulaayaa gaya tha
 The four were arrested by the Delhi Police in connection with the Pune blast in August 2012
 tab in chaaron ne kubul kiya tha ki unke indian mujahiddeen saathi said makabool urf jubair ne myanmar main muslimon par ho rahi kathith jyadatiyon kaa badla lene ke liye bodhgaya main mandiron par hamale kii yojana banaai thi
 Maqbool was arrested in Hyderabad but the Indian Mujahideen attack on the Mahabodhi temple remained feared because it was part of the Bhatkal brothers' plan
 vinay kumaar ne is bare main sarkaar ko report bheji thi or is saal march main unka gaya se tabadalaa ho gaya
 In March this year, the Intelligence Bureau had informed Bihar of the possibility of a second terrorist attack
 isamen bataaya gaya tha ki indian mujahiddeen ke do aadmi bheed vaali jagahon par bam dhamaake karne ke liye rajya main ghuse hai or isamen khaastaur par patna ko nishane par bataaya gaya tha
 The ib's confidential information claimed that the two terrorists were beheaded and wanted to enjoy the blood-soaked corpses
 ravivaar ko bodhgaya main hue silsilewar dhamaakon se lagata he ki soochna ko gambhirtha se nahin liya gaya
 The five blasts took place inside the Mahabodhi temple complex, three at the Teergar Mutt where about 200 trainee monks live and one each at the bus stand near the 80-foot Buddha statue and near the bypass
 teen bina fate or niskriy kiye hue bam bhi baraamad hue
 For so many years, the Government of Bihar kept out of harmony of Mahabodhi Temple
 yah kisi ko nahin maaloom kii mul rup se mandir kii saaf-safai, marammat, shraddhaluon kii dekhbhaal or suraksha tathaa mandir ke bheetar sahi dhang se puja-archana ke liye jimmedaar beatiemasi ne bhitari suraksha kii jimmedaari kab sanbhali
 BTMC member Arvind Singh says, "we have followed the tradition of having a private security guard for decades
 cobra security agency ko do saal pehle rakhaa gaya tha
 "the District Officer of Gaya at BTMC is the ex-officio Chairman
 8 sadasyon ko rajya sarkaar 3 saal ke liye manonith karti he
 They consist of 4 Buddhists and 4 Hindus
 inamen shiv mandir ke mahant ke alaava baaki 3 hindu sadsy rajnatik sifarish se aae hai
 Kumud Verma, JD (U) and Bhola Mishra, daughter-in-law of Arvind Singh and former Union Minister Upendranath Verma, are BJP leaders
 maujuuda samiti 2008 main gathit hui thi
 In 2011, he was given a second term
 patna main ek varisht ipies adhikari ne kaha ki mahabodhi mandir kii suraksha nausikhie haathon main saunpna rajya sarkaar kii badi laaparvaahee thi
 Even after receiving a strong information about the possibility of a terrorist attack, it is a grave mistake for the government and the district administration to keep the responsibility of managing the hand of BTMC
 iske liye sirf beatiemasi ko bali kaa bakra nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 Those who appointed him, they bear the real responsibility
 beatiemasi kii aakshamata ko saaf taur par ujagar karte hue gaya ke police mahanireekshak naiyyar hasanan khan ne 3 july ko suraksha kii samiksha ke liye hui baithak main sifarish kii thi ki samiti ke gards ko puri training di jaae kyonki unhen mattl detector pakadia bhi nahin aata
 According to a Gaya police officer, BTMC and Gaya district police had decided to follow Khan's suggestions after the weekend
 lekin tab tak dhamaake ho gaye
 The Bihar cabinet approved its formation on July 9, nearly four-and-a-half years after it received a proposal from the police headquarters to constitute the state's ATS
 bihar aties main 344 karmi honge
 Its budget 15 under the leadership of an IG rank officer
 3 karod ru
 Will be annually
 aatanki hamalon kii soochna par amal karne ke bare main nitish sarkaar bahut had tak nakaara sabit hui he kyonki yah dharna majboot thi ki islamic aatanki gut bihar main hi bhartee karte hai isliye use nishaanaa nahin banaaenge
 Perhaps this is why the Bihar government kept sleeping despite the Intelligence Bureau's very clear warning about the attack on the temple
 july 2006 se vibhinn sarkari agenciyon ne bihar main madhubani, kishanganj or darbhanga jilon se vibhinn aatanki hamalon main bhagidaari ke aarope main 16 logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 Of these, 11 have been caught in the last two years
 aisi aakhri giraftaar ek saal pehle may 2012 main hui thi
 Karnataka Police arrested Kafeel Akhtar from Darbhanga in connection with the blast at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore
 mukhyamantri ne us giraftaar kaa kadaa virodh kiya tha
 He alleged that the Karnataka police did not contact the local police before the arrest
 nitish ke is virodh se shaayad unhen alpsankhyak samudaay se kuch sahanubhuti mili hogi
 There has been no arrest in Bihar since then
 usee maheene darbhanga main baadh samaila ke makenical ejeeniyar faseeh mahmud ko aatanki samparkon ke aarope main saudi arab se pakadaa gaya tha
 Three days after the serial blasts, 15 CCTV cameras received blurry pictures as none had nightvision
 police ne paanch logon ko shaq main pakadaa
 a youth was caught by the police on Sunday on the basis of voter ID card found in an unclaimed bag in Mahabodhi Mahavir campus
 bag main buddha bhikshuon kaa gerua paridhaan siwara bhi tha
 The young man claimed to have lost his identity card and was not formally arrested
 patna se pakadi gai mahila sahit chaar yuvaaon ne ravivaar kii aadhi raat ko sirf do ghante ke liye bodhgaya main ek hotel main ek cameraa kiraaye par liya tha
 He later returned to Patna
 in paanchon ko poochtacha ke baad jane diya gaya he
 That is, the NIA and Bihar Police still have no clue
 shuruaati daur main abhi tak koi kamyaabi nahin mil saki he
 The state administration is very cautious and has not named the Indian Mujahideen
 lekin bodhgaya main maujuud andhra pradesh aties ke adhikari ne india today ko bataaya ki is puri sajeesh ko anjaam dene kaa tarika indian mujahiddeen jaisaa hi he
 They have to be sent to state-of-the-art laboratories to correctly identify the people seen in the photographs from CCTV cameras
 camaron main sirf do din kii footage rakhane kii kshamta he or police ke paas sirf vahi suraag he
 5 on Sunday morning
 30 se 5
 The only purpose of the 10 blasts between 58 was to have bloodshed in the morning when Buddhist followers came to pray
 tergar math main fate teen bam khel ke maidan main lagaae gaye the, jahaan nae bhikshu footbal khelte hai
 In the eyes of a senior IPS officer, the blasts were weak but were a brainchild
 bihar ke police mahanideshak abhayanand ne kaha ki chaanbin lambii chalegi kyonki tamaam suraagon ko jodpha he or gaiyr jaruri soochnaaon ko hataanaa he
 a major drawback of the investigation is the lack of sufficient clues
 enie bina fate niskriy bamon kii jaanch nahin kar pai he kyonki unhen court main pesh karne ke liye rakhaa gaya he or inaki jaanch ke liye court kii anumati chahie
 So far ammonium nitred has been found hidden in the pieces of the mini gas cylinder in which the bomb was placed
 enie ko dhamaakon se pehle or baad main bodhgaya aane-jane vaali mobile phone kol kaa byora mil gaya he
 He is currently being scrutinized and a number of them are eyeing
 jisase nai dilli ke ek hi number par 40 esemes bheje gaye the
 Now this number is being investigated
 un numberon kii vishesh taur par padtaal kii ja rahi he jo dhamaakon ke baad band paae gaye
 Investigators believe at least 15 people planted the bombs
 ab to dhundhlee video footage ke alaava mobile phone se mili nateezon kaa hi sahaara he
 But after some time when Satyendra Jain sitting in the same car came back, it came to know that Satyendra Jain had gone to the temple
 darasal satyendra jain ke civil lines ke sarkari awaas se kuch hi duuri par digambar jain mandir he jahaan satyendra jain rose subah kaam par nikalne se pehle niyamit rup se jate hai
 But CBI arrived before going to the temple on Wednesday
 lekin jab aaj bhi satyendra jain ne sibiai se mandir jane ko kaha to sibiai ne apane saath le jaakar mandir ke darshan karaae
 This is important because during the CBI raid it is usually seen that the one who is raiding here, gets away from house arrest in his house or office, cannot get out in such a situation that Delhi PWD and Health Minister Satyendra Jain of CBI Red The temple is probably the first to go
 ye ahm baat isliye he kyonki sibiai red ke dauraan aamtaur par dekha jaataa he ki jiske yahaan red ho rahi he wo apane ghar yaa daphtar main najarband se ho jaataa he baahar nahin nikal saktaa aise main dilli ke PWD or swasthya mantri satyendra jain sibiai red ke dauraan mandir jane vaale shaayad pehle shaks ban gaye hai

 It is worth mentioning that in those days DG Vanzara was the chief of ATS who is currently in jail in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case
 lagbhag do maheene pehle dilli police ne kathith rup se tihaad jail ke ek kaidi dwaara phone par kii gai baatcheet ko suna tha, jo jail ke hi kisi karmchaaree kaa phone istemaal kar rahaa tha
 Sources have said that during a similar hearing, the prisoner indicated that five accused of gangrape and brutally murdered a medical student in December may be attacked
 bataaya gaya he ki tihaad jail ke adhikariyon ko is khatre ke bare main jaankaree de di gai thi, or uske baad se paanchon aropiyon kii suraksha badha di gai thi
 Recently, he was accompanied by 20-30 armed policemen to take him to the court and inside
 sutron kaa kahana he ki kathith rup se police dwaara intercept kii gai is baatcheet main kaidi ne sanket diya tha ki gangrape ke in aropiyon par unhen saket fasttrack court le jate vakt hamalaa kiya ja saktaa he, jahaan unhen sunwaayee ke liye rose le jaaya jaataa he
 It is noteworthy that the body of Ram Singh, one of the same five accused, was found hanging from the roof of his jail cell on Monday
 udhar, tihaad jail ke adhikariyon ko ramsingh kii maut par apni praarambhik report abhi file kerani he, kyonki uski maut ke tareeke or paristhitiyon ne kai sawaal khadey kar die hai
 According to the post-mortem report, Ramsingh died of hanging, and there are no marks on his body, but Ramsingh's family claims that he has been murdered, and the case should be investigated by the CBI needed

 ullekhneey he ki unheen paanch aropiyon main se ek ramsingh kii laash somvaar ko jail ke uske cell kii chat se latakati pai gai thi
 Meanwhile, Tihar Jail officials are yet to file their preliminary report on Ramsingh's death, as the manner and circumstances of his death have raised many questions
 postmortem kii report ke mutabik ramsingh kii maut latakane se hui he, or uske sharir par kisi tarah kii bhi chot ke nishaan nahin hai, lekin ramsingh ke parivaar kaa daawa he ki uski hatya kii gai he, or is maamle kii jaanch sibiai se karai jaani chahie
 The comments paanchon aropiyon ne adaalat main bhi kaha tha ki ve tihaad jail main unki jaan ko khatra mahasoos kar rahe hai, kyonki jail ke baaki kaidi aksar un par taane kasate hai, or hamalaa tak kar dete hai, lekin police sutron ke anusaar is baar kaa yah khaas khatra jail parisar ke baahar hamale se judaa tha
 After the death of Ramsingh, the lawyers of the remaining four accused in Tihar Jail have written to Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar requesting that either they be transferred to another jail, or their security in Tihar Be increased
