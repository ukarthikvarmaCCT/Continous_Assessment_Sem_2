 After catching other fish, we will waste our time in giving information to the security guard, so when will the caught fish go to market? vah kehete hai, kabhi-kabhi ek saath kai naav nikalati hai, yaa laut kar aati hai
 If the security guard alone takes hours to complete the token process, then our fish will die

 Security towers ranging from increasing patrols in the sea to security towers, fishermen's biometric cards, different color codes for each district's boat and now this new token system
 lekin ye sab kitna kargar he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki samandar main gast ke liye tainaat 450 police sipaahiyon main se kareeb 230 ko tairnaa hi nahin aata
 No terrorists should be bribed in the city through the sea, so many security measures schemes have been implemented in the last seven years
 ab ek nai token yojana lagu kii gai he, lekin ye yojana shuru hote hi vivaadon main ghir gai he
 Fishermen have started opposing it
 matsay vibhaag kii taraf se lagu is token yojana ke tahat machuaaron ko har baar samandar main jane se pehle apana naam or pura byoraa form main bhar kar dena he or laut kar aane ke baad phir se suraksha guard ko suchit karnaa he
 Commissioner of Fisheries Department Madhukar Gaikwad says that this is a part of maritime security and through this we will have information about how many fishermen are in the sea and how many have returned, which is very important
 madhukar gayakwad ke mutabik tamilnadu or gujarat me ye token yojana pehle se lagu he
 However, the fisherman disagrees
 machuaaron ke netaa damodar tandel kaa kahana he ki ye suraksha ke naam par chote machuaaron ko pareshaan karne kaa tughluqi farmaan zyada he
 Tandel alleges that the token system has not been implemented on big jetties like Sassoon Dak where there are big fishermen

 He belongs to the Navy, Coastguard, Custom and Police

 akelaa suraksha guard token kii prakriya puri karne main ghanton lagayegaa to hamaari to machhliyaan hi mar jaaengi
 The comments aapako bataa den ki mumbai or maharashtra ke 720 kilometre lambey samandar kinare par kul 173 landig point hai, lekin abhi sirf 91 plint par hi token vyavastha lagu kii gai he

 According to Madhukar Gaikwad, this token scheme is already in force in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat
 haalanki machuaare isse sahamat nahin he
 Fisherman leader Damodar Tandel says that this is more of a Tughlaki decree to harass small fishermen in the name of security
 tandel kaa aarope he ki sasoon dak jaise bady jettiyon par jahaan bade-bade machuaare hai, vahaan token vyavastha nahin lagu kii gai he

 Raj Kapoor was not only called the showman of Bollywood
 unka har kaam shandaar hota tha
 The films used to be grand, their parties were no less spectacular
 holi or deepawali par raaj kapur ke jashn ko log aaj yaad karte hai
 There is no answer to RK Studio's Holi
 bollywood sitaron kii tamaam yaaden raaj kapur kii holi party se judi hai
 Every special and common person of Bollywood used to attend that party
 dilip kumaar, manoj kumaar, shammi kapur, shashi kapur, amitabh bachchan, shatrughna sinha, jitendra, dharmendra hema malini jaisi hastiyaan aarake studio kii har party main najar aati thim
 But there was also a Bollywood superstar who does not attend this party
 raaj kapur se pehle bollywood main is tarah bhavy tareeke se holi celibratt karne kii parampara nahin thi
 But Raj Kapoor started the Holi party of film stars, which later proved to be the most amazing party
 holi par aarake studio main aisa samaa bandhata tha ki sabhi salbhar uskaa intazaar karte the
 Every small and big Bollywood star was invited to Raj Kapoor's party at RK Studios
 lekin sadabahaar abhinayta dev anand us party main shaamil nahin hote the
 He was the only big star of that era, who did not appear at RK Studio's party
 haalanki isaki vajah dev anand or raaj kapur ke bich kisi tarah kaa manmutav nahin tha
 Both were very good friends
 darasal, devanand ko shuru se hi holi khilne kaa shauk nahin tha
 He always kept distance from this festival
 rajkpur ko dev anand kii ye baat pataa thi
 So he never invited Dev Anand to RK Studios' Holi Party
 aarake studio main rang khilne ke khaas intjaam kiye jate the
 Dance songs were also arranged
 mehmaanon ko tarah tarah ke vyanjan bhi parose jate the
 At RK Studio's Holi Party, film stars celebrated Rangparva throughout the day
 vaise bataate chalem ki 1988 tak aarake studio main har saal holi kheli gai
 But after the death of Raj Kapoor, the procession of Holi of RK Studio came to an end forever
 nirbhaya cond ko 16 disambar 2017 ke din paanch saal puure ho gaye, lekin desh main mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadh ghatane kaa naam nahin le rahe
 Exactly the news that came from Raipur on the fifth anniversary of the Nirbhaya incident is also surprising because usually the employed women are considered strong
 lekin bilaspur ke deepi wipro college kii yah ghatana bataati he ki is tarah kii mahilaayein bhi hamaare samaaj main surakshit nahin hai

 a case has been registered against both the professors in the Kotwali police on the complaint of the woman professor
 gauratlab he ki peedita ne isaki shikaayat sidhe pradhanmantri karyaalay main kii
 After this, on the orders of the Prime Minister's Office, the Kotwali police registered a case
 aaropee prophessoron ke khilaaf students ne pradarshan bhi kiya
 IG Purushottam Gautam told, ‚Äúthe Kotwali police are investigating the case by registering cases against both professors
 police ne professor subir sen or professor durgasaran chandra ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya he
 The woman professor wrote a letter to the PMO office for action in this matter
 "IG gautam ne bataaya ki pradhanmantri karyaalay ke sangyaan lene ke baad report darj kiya gaya
 The outraged college students on the matter have demanded the so-called granddaughter and her resignation on the name plate of the two professors

 In the general budget last Friday, an additional tax of about Rs 2 per liter was imposed on petrol and diesel
 iske agle din hi petrol-dijal kii keemton main baari badhotaree hui
 However, the common people got some relief on Tuesday
 darasal, tel companiyon ne dijal ke daam dilli main 10 paise, kolkata main chah paise, jabaki mumbai or chennai main 11 paise prati litre gata die hai
 This is the second consecutive day when diesel prices have come down
 isse pehle somvaar ko bhi dijal ke daam main giravat dekhne ko mili thi
 At the same time, for the first time after the budget, petrol prices have come down
 mangalvaar ko dilli or chennai main petrol chah paise jabaki kolkata main teen paise or mumbai main paanch paise prati litre kam ho gaye hai
 According to the website of Indian Oil, petrol prices in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai on Tuesday decreased to 72 respectively

 aaj birsa munda kii jayanti he
 Birsa, established as a folk god, the hero of tribal self-respect, is extremely dense with literature
 birsa ke jivan sangharsh ne samooche bhartiya sahitya, visheshkar bangala sahitya ko itnaa prabhavit kiya ki ek samoochaa daur adivasee samudaay, unke janajivan or andolan ke vishleshnatmak chithran se bhar gaya
 However this did not happen spontaneously
 suprasiddh bangla kathakaar mahasweta devi ne apni aatmakatha tak main iskaa zikr kiya or likhaa ki sattar ke dashak main sahityakaron evam bengal ke buddhijiviyon ke maansik napunsakata or andhkaar ke kshay kaa sabase bhayanak cheharaa ham dekh sakate hai
 While the country and man were struggling in blood-clothed awareness, Bangla literature had been busy in the 'futile' suicide game of feeding false flowers in the supernatural dream garden of the fairy country, leaving a great grief and pain
 birsa munda kaa janm saal 1875 main ranchi ke lihaatu main hua tha
 It was once part of Bihar but now it has come to Jharkhand
 salga gaanv main praarambhik padhai ke baad birsa chibasa english middle skool main padhane aae
 Birsa Munda was deeply attached to his land, culture
 kehete hai jab vah apane skool main pard rahe the tabhi mundaon, munda saradaaron jameen jabariyaa chhini jane lagi
 a rebellion against the British government started to develop in the mind of Birsa Munda, son of Sugna Munda and Karmi Hatu
 yaheen se birsa munda adivaasiyon ke bhoomi andolan ke samarthak ban gaye
 In his speeches, the rights of tribals over water, forest and land began to grow in debate
 
 And from here the struggle of his life started
 mahasweta devi ne birsa munda ke isi jivan sangharsh par bangala upanyaas ‚Äòaranyar adhikaar‚Äô likhaa, jo hindi main ‚Äòjangal ke daavedaar‚Äô naam se chapa
 This novel of Mahashweta Devi is not just a literary, subjective or historical narrative, it has a different significance
 unhone bebas adivaasiyon ke bich mishanri gatividhiyon ke paakhand ko bhi ujagar kiya he ki kaise ek padri dow notrate ne logon ko laalach diya ki agar vah isai bane or uske anudeshon kaa paalan karen to vah munda saradaaron kii chhini hui jameen waapas kara degaa
 Birsa's stay with the Chaibasa Mission from 1886 to 1890 was his personality building period
 yahi vah daur tha jisane birsa munda ke andar badale or swabhimaan kii jwaala paidaa kar di
 When the Munda Sardars agitated for the land withdrawal in 1886-87, this movement was not only suppressed but Christian missionaries condemned it as well
 birsa munda kii baghawat ke peeche kii vajahon main ek vajah vaadakhilaphi va fareb bhi tha
 It is said that he was expelled from school after seeing Birsa's attitude
 1890 main birsa tathaa uske pita chibasa se waapas aa gaye
 Birsa Munda also had a widespread impact on Santhal Rebellion, Chuar Movement, Kol Rebellion
 apni jati kii durdasha, saamaajik, saanskrithik evam dharmik asmita ko khatre main dekh unke man main kranti kii bhaavana jaag uthi
 He pledged in his mind that he will bring back the rule of Mundas and create awareness among his people
 ‚Äòjangal ke daavedaar‚Äô birsa ke isi sangharsh-yatra or angrejon ke daman kii gaatha he
 This novel has been written about: the portrayal of living, conscious faith in the senses, mythology and eternal beliefs of the primitive castes living in the dense forests of many districts of Bihar! Worshiped like the mother of the jungles, black-and-nature like sinless-shaven, ho, hul, Santhal, kol and other barbarians (?), Against the exploitation by uncivilized (?) Castes and the wilderness even from the darkness of the new moon night
 An epic story of armed revolution aimed at taking back the rights taken away by ownership! The illiterate Birsa, 25 years old, became the 'god' for the people struggling in this revolt at the end of the nineteenth century
 Was - but he accepted this speech of 'god' to bring about a complete revolution in his life, in practice, in thinking and in economic and political situations
 kodon kii maar se udhade kaale jism par laal lahu zyada laal, zyada gadha dikhta he na! is vidroh kii romaanchakaari, maarmik, prerak satyakatha he- jangal ke daavedaar
 The great story of the sacrifices of the souls given by laughing, dancing and singing, the ultimate innate faith and faith - the claimants of the forest! So read on the literature on Aaj Tak pustak anshah jangal ke daavedaar9 june, saal 1900
 Ranchi jail
 savere aath baje birsa khun kii ulti kar, achet ho gaya
 Birsa Munda - Son of Sugana Munda; Age twenty-five years - prisoner under consideration
 teesri farvari ko birasa pakadaa gaya tha, kintu us maas ke antim saptaah tak birasa or anya mundaon ke viruddh cese taiyaar nahin hua tha
 At that time Barrister Jacob was fighting on behalf of Munda people
 vah ab bhi lard rahe hai
 Birsa knew that Jacob would fight on his behalf
 birsa ko pataa tha ki jacob ko uske liye ladanaa na padegaa
 Birsa was caught in many sections of the Criminal Procedure Code, but Birsa knew that he would not be punished
 bholaa birsa anjaan he, lekin vah ek tasaveer ke baad duusari tasaveer- ise pahchaan saktaa he- sab dekh saktaa he
 Bhat Munda remains a dream in people's lives
 ghato ekmaatr khaadya he jo munda logon ko khaane ko miltaa he
 It is a dream to meet Bhat with this
 kisi-na-kisi tarah bhaat ke sapane ne hi birasa ke jivan ko niyantrit kar rakhaa tha
 Most of the time, Birsa complains loudly - 'why should the Mundas eat only ghats? Why don't they eat rice like the Daiku people? And Bhat was Randha, so Birsa was caught on 3rd February
 birsa so rahaa tha
 The woman was cooking rice
 nile akaash main dhuaan uth rahaa tha, birasa neend kii god main tha; tabhi logon ne uthta hua dhuaan dekh liya
 Then Bangaon - followed by Khunti - followed by Ranchi
 birasa ke haathon main hathkadiyaan thim; donon ore do sipaahi the
 Birsa had a turban on his head; Was wearing a dhoti badan par or kuch nahin tha- isi se hawa or dhoop ek saath chamadi ko chhed rahe the
 People were standing on both sides of the road
 sabhi munda the
 The women were beating their chests; The men were raising their hands towards the sky, saying, "those who have caught you, they will not be able to see even the month of Magha
 If they keep spreading the net, then the victim caught in that trap will not be allowed to take them home
" 'kintu birsa un par khafa nahin hoga
 Got caught Why not get caught? Did not the deputy commissioner give him five hundred rupees after counting? Five hundred rupees is a lot! No shaved man ever had five hundred rupees; Are not
 munda agar raat main sote-sote sapana bhi dekhtaa he to sapane main bahut hota he to vah maharani mark das rupye dekh paata he
 They have got five hundred rupees - why not get Birsa apprehended? Actually Birsa was getting angry on himself
 neend kyon aa gai ? neend na aa jaati to vah jaagta rahata
 Do not let the flame burn the fire
 jab aag na sulagati, aasmaan main dhuaan na uthta, koi bhi dekh yaa jaan na paata! raah chalate-chalate birasa ke man main ho rahaa tha- is samay bhi achet birasa ke man main aayaa- vah aag unhone buja to di thi na? munda logon ko kam hi dhyaan rahata he
 The fire burns the forest, the forest cover spreads, and for years the forest dries, and becomes very hot
 isi se to birsa ne ‚Äòulgulaan‚Äô main sabakuch acchhee tarah jala daalana chaha tha
 The forest does not burn in the fire of Ulagulan; Man's blood and heart burns! The forest does not burn in that fire! For the Munda people, the forest becomes like a new mother - like the mother of Birsa; Sits the children of the forest in the dock
 isiilie to birsa ne jangal kaa adhikaar chaha tha! vah jangalon ko diku logon ke adhikaar se chin legaa
 The forest is the mother of the Munda people and the Diku people have defiled the mother of the Munda people
 birasa ne ulgulaan kii aag jalaakar maan-jangal ko shuddh karnaa chaha tha
 After that Munda and Ho, Kol and Santhal Oraon wanted to claim the ownership of the forest, the right of the Aranya of Chota Nagpur, Palamu, Singhbhum, Chakradharpur - the rights of all the forests so that they could reside in the mother's lap
 birasa samaj gaya ki ab vah chalaa jayega, kyonki aaj hi savere usne khun kii badi bhayanak kai kii thi
 Despite being unconscious, Birsa was enchanted by seeing the color of his blood
 khun kaa rang itnaa laal hota he! sabake hi khun kaa rang laal hota he; baat use bahut mahatva kii or jaruri lagi
 As if there was a need to tell this to someone! Who needed to tell? Who doesn't know? Amulya knows, Birsa knows, Munda knows
 sahab' log nahin jaanate
 Jacob knows lekin jail kaa suparitendent, dipti kamishnar- ye log nahin jaanate
 Do not know - therefore, they did not come with army troops and guns, and cannon, to kill the people who used to shoot arrows, bullocks and mundas who resorted to stone
 birasa agar bol saktaa to kah jaataa- 'sahab logo! khun ke rang main koi antar nahin hota
 As much as you get hurt when you kill, the shaved people feel the same
 munda logon ke jivan par tum logon ne jabardastee adhikaar jamaa liya he
 You feel like giving up that right, the Munda people who give the forested land in the hands of the Daiku people feel the same
 'kintu birasa kuch kah na paaya
 He is not able to open his eyes - someone has extinguished the mahua oil torch and dhabri inside! Like someone is shaking Birsa! Saying: Sleep, sleep, sleep

 Party leader Ashish Khaitan said that 'BJP has shown its ideological bankruptcy

 ' lekin, kiran bedi ke jawaab se lagata he ki wo is mudde ko zyada tarjeeh nahin de raheen
 Kiran Bedi said, 'now what will they decide about my chair too? It was pm's block, i sat down, the talk was over, why would they decide on which seat i should sit
 ' Actually, Aam Aadmi Party leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal did not even get invited for the Republic Day celebrations
 jabaki ve khud isamen janaa chaahate the
 On Saturday, Arvind Kejriwal while talking to NDTV India said that 'I wanted to go to the Republic Day celebrations on 26 January, but i was not invited
 ' Surprisingly, when Kiran Bedi was asked about this, her terse reply was that if Kejriwal were in the BJP, she would have got an invitation, although later she appeared to be trying to handle her point and said 'mange mange They do not go and meet and Kejriwal needs to show some maturity
 bedi ne is baat par bhi aapatti jataai ki kejariwal ne unase puche bina auto ke peeche unke poster laga die or unke liye avasarwaadi shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 In the battle of Kiran vs Kejriwal, something new is being seen every day, in such a situation, what is happening today, see and wait for what is going to happen tomorrow

 Strongly opposing efforts to make 'bhojpal' in the name of Raja Bhoj, naming Rajdhani Bhopal of Madhya Pradesh, the Congress has warned that if this happens, agitation will be done
 pradesh congress pravaktaa aarif masood ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki yadi bhopal kaa naam bhopal kiya gaya, to iske virodh main andolan kiya jayega
 He claimed that according to his information the state government wants to change the name of Bhopal to 'bhojpal' in the name of Raja Bhoj
 unhone sarkaar se poocha ki yah ek hajaar varsh puraane koun se raja bhoj hai, jinka ullekh bade-bade hordings, vigyaapan evam samachar patron ke jariye kiya ja rahaa he
 State Congress spokesman said that according to his own information, the period of Raja Bhoj who built Bhopal's pond and settled Bhojpal city is about 1430 years old
 is bare main unhone kuch puraatan granthon kaa ullekh karte hue daawa kiya ki itihaas main lagbhag chaudaa raja bhoj hue hai
 Masood said that Bhopal has a golden history and its name is known in every corner of the world
 shahar kaa naam badalane kii bajaay unka suzav he ki sarkaar apni yojanaon kaa naam ‚Äòraja bhoj‚Äô ke naam par kar sakati he
 Like 'taj Utsav' celebrated in Agra, 'bhoj Utsav' can be celebrated here, which all religions and societies of Bhopal should celebrate together and present the example of 'ganga-jamuni Tehzeeb' here
 duusari ore, bhartiya communist party ne bhi aaj yahaan ek bayaan jari kar bhopal kaa naam badalane ke prayaason kaa virodh kiya he
 Appealing the party's state secretary Shailendra Kumar Shelly, he said that people who believe in all democratic and secular values should be mobilized against this effort

 He has warned of agitation against any such attempt

 aag ugalati jubaan ne unka kad itnaa badha diya he ki bhaajapa ke kaaryakarta har jagah varun-varun kii rat laga rahe hai
 Everyone needs Varun for campaigning, be it Pilibhit or Phir Raipur
 bhaajapa ne unki giraftaari kaa siyaasi faaydaa uthaane ke liye puri taiyaari kar lee he
 This political drama has raised Varun's market price considerably
 jo bhaajapa pehle varun ke zahreele bhaashan se kinaaraa kar rahi thi, vahi varun ke samarthan main jabardast fielding karne main juty hui he
 This was another sign of Narendra Modi's growing position in the BJP

 Even though Advani was not happy with this new team, he could not do anything
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri modi is par pehle hi apni pakki muhar laga chuke the or rajnath unheen ke paale main jane kaa faisla kar chuke the
 a party official said, "advani ji was helpless
 unhone rajnath se kaha ki ve jaisaa thik samajhen, karen
 Advani was against the appointment of former Gujarat minister and accused of murder and charge-sheeted Amit Shah as party general secretary
 unka kahana tha ki isse aam logon ke bich party kii chhavi kharaab hogi or congress ko bijepi par hamalaa karne kaa hathiyaar mil jayega
 But Modi was adamant on bringing his loyalist to the national team
 isliye adwani kii ek nahin chali
 He had lost his right to veto the party
 adwani kii sthiti itani kamjor ho chuki he ki ve madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko modi ke saath party ke sansadeey board main laane main asafal rahe
 Like Modi, Chauhan is also considered a well-to-do chief minister
 rajnath kaa kahana tha ki modi ko party ke caderon kaa baari samarthan hasil he or chouhan ko madhya pradesh main abhi teesri baar apni pakad dikhaani baaki he
 Modi, in contrast, has managed to retain power in Gujarat for the third time in a row

 adwani kaa maananaa tha ki unhen apane rajyon par dhyaan dena chahie
 But Rajnath could not keep them out, as the Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley supported them both
 mana jaataa he ki adwani ne party ke ek varisht netaa se kaha ki team ke sadasyon ko unki yogyata ke aadhaar par nahin, balki kuch netaaon kaa kareebi hone ke kaaran chunaa gaya he
 The modi-jaitley pair is so powerful that it is difficult for the BJP president to ignore them
 adwani ko haashie par daalkar rajnath party kii vichaardhaara ke mulsutra rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ko bhi khush karne main kaamyaab rahe hai
 The message is clear for Advani

 Senior party leaders say that after the elections in Karnataka in May, the leadership of the election campaign committee that the BJP will form may go into Modi's hands
 rajnath kii team par modi kii muhar to abhi shuruyatbhar he
 Modi's desire was also to make Smriti Irani as vice-president and Meenakshi Lekhi as spokesperson
 lekin rajnath singh ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki nai team banane main modi kaa koi haath nahin rahaa he
 "amit Shah was included because he is very valuable to the party," says an aide to the party president
 ve bahut chatur netaa hai or chunaav ranneeti banane main maahir hai
 Pending the case against him in the state (gujarat), he could not be used
 isliye party ne 2014 ke aam chunaavon ke liye unka istemaal karne kaa faisla kiya
 Shah also got the support of RSS man Ramlal because of his inclination towards Hindutva
 raamalaal party kii rashtriya team main sanghathan mahasachiv hai
 Sources claim that the RSS supported Uma Bharati as vice-president and Varun Gandhi as general secretary and gave his approval
 sanyog se bharti ke naam kaa suzav adwani ne bhi diya lekin rajnath or aresas kii ichha ke kaaran hi ve chuni gayi
 The same happened in the case of Muralidhar Rao, who is considered to be the hand of RSS and a former activist of Swadeshi Jagran Manch
 unhen mahasachiv bana diya gaya
 Advani's favorite Balbir Punj managed to get the post of vice-president due to a good equation with the RSS and Modi

 The sour relationship between him and Modi is not hidden from anyone in the party

 Hindutva has been strengthened with giving importance to people like Bharti and Varun and this has angered BJP leaders who are believed to be moderate
 ravishankar prasad unheen netaaon main se ek hai
 He has been removed from both the post of general secretary and chief spokesperson
 party kii chaatr shakha abivipi ke sadsy rah chuke ravishankar prasad party kii pragatisheel tasviir pesh karte rahe hai
 Not only this, he was considered close to Advani
 isi tarah, varisht netaa yashavanth sinha or jaswant singh ko bhi koi mahatv nahin diya gaya he
 But supporters of Rajnath believe that justice has been done to all
 rajnath ke kareebi sutara bataate hai ki maujuuda sthiti ko dekhte hue unhone apni taraf se sabase acha kaam karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 He took care of all the leaders while forming a new team
 76-sadasyeey team main 80 pratishat netaa 60 saal se kam umr ke hai
 Party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar says in defense, "the new team shows the picture of an organized BJP, as it includes all regions, social groups and women are given more representation than before
" yahi nahin, nai team main yogyata kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 "the way Modi supporters and those who have a good relationship with him have been given preference in creating a new team, it seems that Modi's dominance in the party has been established
" party ke bheetar kuch log modi ko pradhanmantri pad ke sambhavit ummidavaar ke taur par pesh karne par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 a senior party leader expresses the same dilemma of the party, saying, "even if Modi is the most qualified person in the party, but if he is made the Prime Ministerial candidate, will the alliance partners support him?" He may be the most capable leader of the party, but he is the least acceptable person in the coalition
 ‚Äùlekin gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke samarthakon kaa maananaa he ki aam chunaavon se thik pehle bijepi kaa modikaran karnaa samajhadaari bharaa faisla he
 He says it is wrong to consider Modi as the face of Hindutva only
 modi ke ek kareebi netaa kehete hai, ''ve vikaas ke pratik hai, jinaki apni akhil bhartiya apil he
 "vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Sinhal recently compared Modi's popularity to Jawaharlal Nehru
 sutron kaa kahana he ki modi dhire-dhire hi sahi, lekin badi chaturaai se apni chhavi taiyaar kar rahe hai
 He talks of development without any discrimination, taking advantage of the failure of the central government in the UPA government on issues like corruption and inflation, and at the same time assures Hindu voters that the party will not take any steps to appease the minorities, Would rather fight against it
 lekin alpsankhyakon ko khush karne vaale faislon ke khilaaf ladgaye kaa vaada karke paroksh rup se hindutv ko badhaava dena sabhi logon ko sahi nahin lag rahaa he
 "the time has come for the party to move from Hindutva to nationalism," says a young BJP leader

 sansad kii yah samiti jaananaa rigerv bank or vitt mantralay se jaananaa chaahati thi ki aakhir notebandi kaa faisla kab, kaise or kiske dwaara liya gaya
 To answer these questions, the Reserve Bank had prepared a note for the Parliamentary Committee

 notebandika faisla donon kendra sarkaar or rigerv bank kaa joint faisla tha jisase arthvyavastha main prachlit 500or 1000 rupee kii karency ko band kiya gaya
 2
 notebandika faisla karne ke peeche sabase ahm vajah desh main nakli karency ke sanchaar ko puri tarah se band karne kaa tha
 3
 rigerv bank chahta tha ki 500 or 1000 rupee kii karency kii jagah par 5000 or 10,000 rupee kii nai karency kaa sanchaar kiya jaae
 To this effect, the Reserve Bank advised the Central Government in October 2014
 4
 The new currency communication of 2000 rupees was chosen considering the inflation in the country
 lihaaja is nai karency se puraani karency ko band karnaa arthvyavastha main karency sanchaar ke hit main tha
 5
 rigerv bank ne kaha he ki 2000 rupee kii nai karency aam aadmi kaa dhyaan aakarshith karti lihaaja notebandi ke saath-saath is nai karency ke sanchaar kaa faisla liya gaya
 6
 rigerv bank ne bataaya he ki 2000 rupee kii nai karency kii siries chhapane ke liye printing press ko june 2016 main nirdesh de diya gaya tha

 rigerv bank ne bataaya ki june 2016 se nai karency kii printing shuru hone ke baad paryaapt maatra main stock taiyaar ho gaya tha lihaaja, 7 november, 2016 ko kendra sarkaar ne rigerv bank ko chitthee likhi jiske baad 8 november, 2016 ko rigerv bank ke central board ne baithak kii or usee dinanotbandike liye gajet notification jari kar diya gaya
 8
 notebandike elaan se pehle rigerv bank ko is baat kaa andaja tha ki puraani karency ko puri tarah se badalanaa sambhav nahin he
 Also, it was in the cognizance of the bank that in the given time, the work of equating the value and volume of the new currency to the old currency cannot be done
 9
 The Reserve Bank was confident that the option of digital payment would be helpful in the currency conversion process
 isse arthvyavastha main nai karency kii maang kaa dabaav kam rahegaa
 10
 notebandiki puri prakriya kaa rigerv bank kii balanceshit par koi asar nahin padegaa

 main sadsy rahanaa chahta hum
 i don't have time ' We showed a story from Marathwada in Maharashtra
 kalejaa munh ko aa gaya
 The mother of five children burnt herself in a house, as there were only two loaves left in her house
 ek maa kii haalat ham shaayad hi samaj paaen ki jab santaanen usase roti maangati hon or dene ke liye kuch naa ho, to wo asahaay maa kya kare? After watching and reading the story, i called my partner again, asked if we were showing anything exaggeratedly
 mere saathi tejas ne kaha, nahin ghar ke saare bartan khaali hai
 The conditions of hungry children were not seen even from them
 kuch madad karke hi aage bade hai
 We also planned some help together
 lekin man main sawaal uthte rahe ki ek ghar main to ham pahunch gaye, lekin baaki kaa kya? sirf ek ghar kii bhukh mitaa kar kya hoga, jab puraa ilaaka hi chapet main he
 This story continued to bother throughout the day
 shaam hote meraa ye vichaar pakkaa ho gaya ki maharashtra main kisaanon kaa katl bade soche samajhe tareeke se hua he
 
 
 And happening
 sarkaron ko to pehle se maaloom he ki marathavada kaise banjar ilaake kii shakl le rahaa he
 Last year, when Indian Science Congress took place, we also reached to participate
 mausam vigyaniyon se hamane poocha tha ki kya marathavada or vidarbha kii pyaas bujh paaegi
 Then the scientists said that this is not possible
 ek kism ke chaaya kshetra or badalte mausam kii maar ye ilaaka jhel rahaa he
 Then we asked the question, do governments know all this? Then it came to know that the rulers have known for a long time what is going to happen in Marathwada? So the question arises that when the rulers know that there will be a drought, then why has no step taken in the last 20 years? The leader does not want to answer
 lekin sach yahi he ki maharashtra ke netaaon ne aisa hone diya he
 Thoughtfully farmers have been killed now there is no doubt about it
 20 saal main jitani bhi sinchai kii yojanaayen bani unamem se zyaadaatar pashchim maharashtra kii ore mode di gayi
 The remaining schemes that Vidarbha and Marathwada got were so corrupted that the canals and dams kept on paper only deteriorating
 pichley ek dashak main jin netaaon ne sinchai vibhaag sambhala wo pashchim maharashtra ke hi the
 He made all the plans for water sharing for his area first
 tippaniyan People from some of the most backward areas of Marathwada migrate during their power days and work as laborers
 ye mazdoor pashchim maharashtra main khapaae jate hai
 Is there any doubt as to why the big leaders of one area of maharashtra want to keep the people of other areas poor? Is unbalanced development not being intentional? marathavada main har maheene 69 kisaan khudakushi kar rahe hai
 
 
 And all this is happening because the state has created a kind of chaos by making unbalanced development
 jahaan mausam kii meharbaani par fasal nirbhar ho, netaaon ke rahamokaram par sinchai kaa pani or baaki kaa vikaas chand logon ke haath main ho, kya aam kisaan bebas or laachaar mahasoos nahin karata? kya yahi laachaari use zehar pine ke liye majboor nahin karti? kya aise hi halaat un logon ke nahin hai jo maut se bachane ke liye syria se bhaagate hai, jaanate hai ki donon taraf maut kaa khatra he
 So is there a difference between the situation of the suffering peasants and the situation of the innocent trapped in the war? kahani dekhne or padhane ke baad maine apane saathi ko phir phone lagaaya, poocha ki kahin kuch ham badha chadhaakar to nahin dikhaa rahe
 My partner Tejas said, no all the utensils in the house are empty
 unase bhi bhukhe bacchon ke halaat dekhe naa gaye
 They have moved forward with some help
 hamane milakar kuch madad kii yojana bhi banaai
 But questions kept arising in our mind that we have reached one house, but what about the rest? What will happen by eradicating the hunger of just one house, when the whole area is in the grip
 din bhar ye kahani pareshaan karti rahi
 By the evening, i was convinced that the killing of farmers in Maharashtra was done in a thoughtful way

 But the truth is that the leaders of Maharashtra have allowed this to happen
 soche samajhe dhang se kisaanon kaa katl hua he ab isamen koi shaq nahin he

 Where the crop is dependent on the kindness of the weather, irrigation water and the rest of the development is in the hands of the leaders, does not the common farmer feel helpless and helpless? Does not this helplessness make him to drink poison? Is not the situation similar to those who flee Syria to avoid death, knowing that there is a danger of death on both sides
 to kya peedit kisaanon ke halaat or yuddh main fanse masuumon ke halaat main koi fark he? This story continued to bother throughout the day
 shaam hote meraa ye vichaar pakkaa ho gaya ki maharashtra main kisaanon kaa katl bade soche samajhe tareeke se hua he
 
 
 And happening
 sarkaron ko to pehle se maaloom he ki marathavada kaise banjar ilaake kii shakl le rahaa he
 Last year, when Indian Science Congress took place, we also reached to participate
 mausam vigyaniyon se hamane poocha tha ki kya marathavada or vidarbha kii pyaas bujh paaegi
 Then the scientists said that this is not possible
 ek kism ke chaaya kshetra or badalte mausam kii maar ye ilaaka jhel rahaa he
 Then we asked the question, do governments know all this? Then it came to know that the rulers have known for a long time what is going to happen in Marathwada? So the question arises that when the rulers know that there will be a drought, then why has no step taken in the last 20 years? The leader does not want to answer
 lekin sach yahi he ki maharashtra ke netaaon ne aisa hone diya he
 Thoughtfully farmers have been killed now there is no doubt about it
 20 saal main jitani bhi sinchai kii yojanaayen bani unamem se zyaadaatar pashchim maharashtra kii ore mode di gayi
 The remaining schemes that Vidarbha and Marathwada got were so corrupted that the canals and dams kept on paper only deteriorating

 He made all the plans for water sharing for his area first
 tippaniyan People from some of the most backward areas of Marathwada migrate during their power days and work as laborers
 ye mazdoor pashchim maharashtra main khapaae jate hai
 Is there any doubt as to why the big leaders of one area of maharashtra want to keep the people of other areas poor? Is unbalanced development not being intentional? marathavada main har maheene 69 kisaan khudakushi kar rahe hai
 
 
 And all this is happening because the state has created a kind of chaos by making unbalanced development
 jahaan mausam kii meharbaani par fasal nirbhar ho, netaaon ke rahamokaram par sinchai kaa pani or baaki kaa vikaas chand logon ke haath main ho, kya aam kisaan bebas or laachaar mahasoos nahin karata? kya yahi laachaari use zehar pine ke liye majboor nahin karti? kya aise hi halaat un logon ke nahin hai jo maut se bachane ke liye syria se bhaagate hai, jaanate hai ki donon taraf maut kaa khatra he
 So is there a difference between the situation of the suffering peasants and the situation of the innocent trapped in the war? beete saal indian science krongress hui to ham bhi shirkat karne pahunche

 com / nuuk1l0tfz The Indian Badminton League (IBL), launched on the lines of the IPL, has come into controversy with the auction of its first session
 india kii best dubles shatler jodi jwaala gutta or ashvini ponppa ne lig ke sanchaalkon par dhokhaa dene kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Significantly, in the league auction on Sunday, both of these six icon players were such that none of the franchises bought them
 iske baad lig ko fouran apane niyam main badlaav karnaa padaa or somvaar ko jwaala ke saath dely smashars ne 31 hajaar america dollar kaa anubandh kiya
 Ashwini was given to Pune Pistons for 25 thousand US dollars
 in donon khilaadiyon ko hue aarthik nuksaan ko dekhte hue lig kuch rakam bataur kshatipurti bhi degi
 Jwala will get 19 thousand US dollars, while Ashwini will get 25 thousand
 dubles match na hone ke chalate hua yah sabajaankaar bataate hai ki lig main dubles match kaa formet na hone ke chalate jwaala or ashvini ke saath aisa hua
 The operators said that when the initial format of the league was formed, doubles matches were placed in it
 usee ke chalate in donon khilaadiyon ke saath contract kiya gaya
 But then the league did not get the doubles' capable and well-known faces
 aise main yah event drop kar diya gaya
 Instead, the men's singles match was increased
 ravivaar ko jab lig ke sanchaalkon ne dekha ki koi bhi frenchiji in donon khilaadiyon main ruchi hi nahin dikhaa rahi he, to nilaamee agle din tak ke liye taal di gai
 After the backroom management, the open auction started on Monday, the Governing Council announced that the base price of both the players had been reduced
 donon khilaadiyon kaa base prise 50 hajaar america dollar se ghataakar thik aadha yani 25 hajaar america dollar kar diya gaya
 These players were given the assurance of compensation for the loss caused by this move
 hamaare munh par tamaacha maaraa gaya haih ashviniek newspaper se baat karte hue ashvini ne kaha ki ye hamaare munh par tamaache kii tarah he
 He said that 'I have been cheated
 hamen bataaya gaya tha ki ham chah iken player hai
 We were promoting this league like an icon player all over the country
 phir achaanak se ye saare badlaav kar die gaye or hamen bataane tak kii jarurat nahin samajhi gai
 'we did not come in this for the greed of money: Jwalaudhar Jwala Gutta said that we have not come in the greed for money in the league
 unhone kaha ki ‚Äòham bas itnaa chaahate the ki jis tarah se duusare iken players kii izzat kii ja rahi he, vaisaa hi suluk hamaare saath bhi kiya jaae
 But this did not happen
 yah bahut bada jhatka he hamaare liye
 i really do not know what to say on this whole issue
 kaaphi sharmnaak he yah
 i never thought that this could happen in a professional league
 ‚Äôin donon khilaadiyon ko is baat par bhi gussa aayaa ki nilaamee kaa daur puraa hone ke baad bhi aayojakon ne unhen kuch nahin bataaya
 No one has bought, so what should we do? While clarifying this whole issue, Ashish Chadha, one of the organizers of the league, said that there was a closed auction for all the icon players
 der raat tak yah process chalaa
 None of the franchises were willing to buy Jwala and Ashwani for the prize
 aise main sabhi frenchiji or lig kii gavarning council ne tay kiya ki base prise ghataakar khuli nilaamee kii jaae
 But these players have signed the contract and we had to protect their interests
 isliye tay kiya gaya ki tay se kam rakam kii nilaamee hone par lig kshatipurti karegi
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is attending the Governing Council of NITI Aayog, made important suggestions regarding the implementation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes, Disaster Grace Grant and Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana
 saath hi nitish kumaar ne ek baar phir bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane kii apni maang doharaai
 Putting the demand for the registration of a particular state once again, Nitish Kumar said, ‚Äúthe state government has been successful in achieving economic growth rate of more than 10 percent for the last several years, which is higher than the national growth rate
 iske baavjood bhi rajya kii prati vyakti aay anya viksit rajyon evam rashtriya ausat kii tulama main kaaphi kam he
 This state has long been demanded by the state government for the status of special state for Bihar to achieve the national average of other developed states of the country and the central government
 is sandarbh main main centre sarkaar dwaara gathit raghuram rajan samiti kii anushansaaon kii ore dhyaan dilaanaa chahta hum, jisamen rajyon ke liye samgr vikaas suchakank prastut kiya gaya tha jiske anusaar desh ke 10 sabase pichde rajyon ko chinhit kiya gaya tha, jisamen bihar bhi shaamil he
 It was also mentioned in the recommendations of this committee that the Central Government can provide central assistance in some other way to increase the pace of development in the most backward states
 'apartment, mal or udyog dhandhe se vikaas nahin ho jaataa : nitish kumaaranithish kumaar ne kaha, 'yadi antar-kshetreey evam antarraji vikaas ke str main bhinnata se sambandhit aankadon kii samiksha kii jaae to paaya jayega ki kai rajya vikaas ke vibhinn maapdandon jaise prati vyakti aay, shiksha, swasthya, urja, sansthic vitt evam maanav vikaas ke suchakaankon par rashtriya ausat se kaaphi neeche hai
 For example, Bihar's per capita income in 2017-18 was Rs 28485, which is just 32 of India's average per capita income of Rs 86668
 86 fisadi thi
 The per capita electricity consumption in the state in 2005 was only 76 units which increased to 280 units in 2017-18 as against the national average of 1149 units
 'bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja hamaare agenda se baahar : 15wein vitt ayog ke adhyaksh en ke singhbihar ke mukhyamantri ne kaha, 'isi tarah se agar maanav vikaas ke suchakaankon ko dekha jaae to paaya jayega ki teji se pragati ke baavjood abhi bhi hamen lambii duuri tay kerani he
 The maternal mortality rate (per lakh population) in the state was 312 in the year 2005 which has come down to 165 in 2016 as against the national average of 130
 varsh 2005 main shishu mrityu dar (prati 1000 jansankhya par) 61 thi jo 2016 main ghatakar 38 ho gai he par abhi bhi rashtriya aus jo 34 he, se ham peeche hai
 It has an additional state's population density of 1106 people per kilometer while its national average is 382
 in aankadon se spasht hota he ki haalanki bihar ne haal ke varshon main adhikansh kshetra main prati kii he lekin abhi bhi vikaas ke suchakaankon main vah rashtriya ausat se kaaphi peeche he
 Nitish chacha'nitish said, 'the rational economic strategy will be the one that encourages such investment and transfer method that will give backward states a fixed The time frame helped to reach the national average of development
 hamaari vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang isi par aadhaarit he
 We have consistently demanded the Central Government to grant special status to Bihar
 bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja milane se jahaan ek taraf centre pryojit yojanaon ken ansh main vruddhi hogi jisase rajya ko apane sansadhano kaa upyog anya vikaas evam kalyankari yojanaon main karne kaa avasar milegaa vahiin duusari ore vishesh rajya kaa darja praapt rajyon ke anuroop hi jiesti main anumaanya pratipurti milane se nijee nivesh ko protsaahan milegaa, udyog sthapit honge, rojgaar ke nae avasar paidaa honge or logon ke jivan str main sudhaar aayega
 '
 
 
 to is vajah se bihar ko nahin diya ja saktaa vishesh rajya kaa darjiske alaava nitish kumaar ne kaha ki badalte hue vaishvik, aarthik, saamaajik evam takneekee parivesh main desh ke vikaas ke liye samaveshi soch evam drushti kii aavashyaktaa he
 Addressing the meeting held at Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Chief Minister placed important issues related to Bihar in the meeting and hoped that all the issues and suggestions would be given due consideration while formulating the development strategy
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kendra pryojit yojanaon, aapadaa anugrah anudaan evam kisaan sammaan nidhi yojana ke kriyanvayan ke sambandh main mahatvapurn suzav die
 The Chief Minister suggested to include non-ryot (sharecroppers and cultivators) farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana
 unhone kaha ki bihar aapadaa-pravan rajya he
 Here a large number of people are affected by disasters like floods and drought
 unhone anurodh kiya ki anugrah anudaan uplabdh karaane ke liye rajya aapadaa mochan kosh ke 25 pratishat kii adhisima ko khatm karte hue varsh 2015 kii tarah purv kii bhaanti jarurat ke mutabik rajya ko raashi milani chahie
 Nitish Kumar said that a provision should be made to implement the central government schemes under the Central Sector Scheme by discontinuing the central government sponsored schemes
 rajya kii praathamikta kii yojanaon kaa karyanvayan rajya sarkaron ko apane sansadhano se rajya skim ke tahat karnaa chahie
 Members of the ruling party strongly opposed in the Lok Sabha, which was commanded by Congress President Sonia Gandhi, as senior BJP leader LK Advani termed the 2009 elections as 'illegitimate'
 loksabhaa main netaa sadan ke rup main susheel kumaar shinde kaa pehla din tha
 As soon as Advani's remarks came, Sonia herself took command of the anti-incumbency of the ruling party and then members of the Congress and its allies created a ruckus on the issue
 kade virodh ke baad adwani ko apni tippanee waapas leni padi
 Sonia used to lodge a strong objection to the remarks and was asked to pressurize the UPA members to withdraw Advani's remarks
 is bich adwani ne kai baar safai dene kii koshish kii lekin har baar sonia asahmati se sir hilaati najar aayin or congress sadsy apane sthanon par khadey hokar adwani kii tippanee ko puri tarah waapas lene kii maang karne lage
 Seeing Sonia's tough attitude, Shinde and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal also asked Advani to withdraw his remarks
 aath saal se samprag kii kaman sambhaal raheen sonia ko 2004 se congress ke satta main aane ke baad se kabhi aise aakraamak mood main nahin dekha gaya
 Even after the House adjourned for the lunch break, Sonia was seen talking to the UPA mps and Ministers on the issue

 hindi, urdu main shaayad hi koi aisa pathak ho, jisane munshi premchand kaa naam na suna ho
 That story is not called emperor, novel emperor alone
 unhone bhartiya samaaj, gaanv or apane daur kaa jaisaa chitra khinchaa vah apratim he
 Munshi Premchand's real name was Dhanpat Rai
 unka janm 31 july 1880 ko banaras ke paas lamahi gaanv main hua tha
 At that time his father used to get twenty rupees salary
 kehete hai jab dhanpat raay saat saal ke the, tabhi unki mata kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 He was married when he was fifteen years old and his father also died when he was sixteen 
 jaisaaki log kehete hai- ladakon kii yah umr khilne-khaane kii hoti he lekin premchand ko tabhi se ghar sanbhaalane kii chintaa kerani padi
 When he studied in the ninth grade, his stepfather had joined his two stepbrothers, stepmothers and his wife himself
 schuli shiksha puri karne ke baad anek prakaar ke sangharshon se guzarate hue unhone 1919 main angreji, farsi or itihaas lekar bie kiya; kintu usase kaaphi pehle 1901 se hi unhone urdu main kahani likhnaa shuru kar diya tha
 He used to write in Urdu under the name Nawab Rai
 1910 main unki urdu main likhi kahaniyon kaa pehla sankalan soze vatan prakashit hua
 After this compilation was confiscated by the British government, he left Nawab Rai and started writing under the name Premchand
 ‚Äòpremchand‚Äô - yah pyaara naam unhen ek urdu lekhak or sampadak dayanarayan nigam ne diya tha
 Premchand kicked off his twenty-year job after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the non-cooperation movement broke out
 1930 ke avagya-aandolan ke shuru hote-hote unhone ‚Äòhans‚Äô kaa prakaashan bhi armbh kar diya
 While hundreds of his stories have contributed to making Premchand a story-emperor, novels like Godan, Sevasadan, Premashram, Gaban, Rangbhoomi, Nirmala will always keep him immortal in Hindi literature
 premchand kii sampurna kahaniyaan sankalan ke bare main sivakumar mishra ne likhaa he, premchand jab katha ke manch par aae, ve bharat kii apni katha parampara se to parichit the hi, urdu or arabi-farsi ke kisson or afasaanon kii bhi unako puri jaankaree thi
 He also read the story-writers of the West
 baavjood iske unki rachanaayen katha-lekhan ke kisi nishchit rup main dhalane ke bajaay, abhivyakti ke unke apane drushtikon kii anurupata main saamne ain, ki kahani ko paardarshee hona chahie, vah sargarbhit ho or apane samvednaatmak uddeshy ko pathak tak bhaleebhanti sampreshit kar paane main samarth ho
 The basic feature of the composition of the stories of Premchand is that he is not Ayasjani from anywhere, from any angle
 nitant sahaj or saadhaaran he
 This spontaneity and simpleness is his biggest feature
 premchand ne apni kahaniyon ke rachana-shilp main ghatnaon ke bajaay sthitiyon or sandarbhon ko zyada mahatv diya he
 Their stories are not incident-oriented stories, nor do they evoke curiosity or curiosity in readers like incident-oriented stories
 premchand kii kahaniyon kaa pathak ‚Äòaage kya hoga‚Äô kii jigyaasa ke bajaay chitrit sthitiyon or prasangon ke bich se ubharate hue premchand ke samvednaatmak uddeshy ke saath ho jaataa he or uske vikaas main ruchi lene lagata he
 Premchand takes his reader into the circle of his condolences in such a way that he moves along with his woven situations and his composed characters
 vah kahanikar kaa humsafar ban jaataa he
 If we look closely at the composition of the stories of Premchand, it will be clear that Premchand as a creator does not interfere unnecessarily in the story
 ve apane samvednaatmak uddeshy ko kahani main buni gai sthitiyon or prasangon ke madhyam se ujagar karte hai or chunki in sthitiyon or prasangon kaa sambandh unki kalpana se na hokar jivan ke yatharth or jivan kii sachchaaiyon se hota he, atev pathak ke dil-dimag main unki vishwasaneeyata aap se aap ankit ho jaati he
 Today, on the birth anniversary of Munshi Premchand, we are presenting his classic story Thakur's well literature for the readers of Aaj Tak with 'complete Stories of Premchand' published by Lok Bharati
 kahaneh thakur kaa kuan- premchandjokhu ne lotaa munh se lagaaya to pani main sakht badboo aayi
 He said to Gangi - what kind of water is this? Can not drink due to bad smell
 galaa sookhaa ja rahaa he or tu sada hua pani pilaae detii he
 Gangi used to fill water everyday in the evening
 kuan dur tha; baar-baar janaa mushkil tha
 If she brought water yesterday, there was absolutely no smell in it; How does the water smell today? He placed the small pot close to the nose, the smell was really bad
 jarur koi jaanavar kuen main girakar mar gaya hoga, magar doosraa pani aave kahan se?thakur ke kuen par koun chadhane degaa
 People will scold from afar
 sahu kaa kuan gaanv ke us sire par he; parantu vahaan bhi koun pani bharne degaa? chauthaa kuan gaanv main he nahin
 Jokhu has been ill for several days
 kuch der tak to pyaas roke chup padaa rahaa, phir bolaa- ab to maare pyaas ke rahaa nahin jaataa
 Bring, drink some water closed nose
 gangi ne pani na diya
 Drinking bad water will increase the disease - knew so much; But it was not known that the boiling of water causes it to malfunction
 boli yah pani kaise piyoge? na jane koun jaanavar mara he
 i bring another water from the well
 jokhu ne aashcharya se uski ore dekha- doosraa pani kahan se laayegi?‚Äòthakur or sahu ke do kuen to hai
 Will a lota not allow water to be filled? ‚Äùhands and feet will break and nothing will happen
 baith chupake se
 The Gods will bless, Thakur lathi, Sahuji will take five
 garibon kaa dard koun samajhataa he! ham to mar bhi jate hai, to koi duaar par jhaankane nahin aata, kandhaa dena to badi baat he
 Such people will allow water from the well? 'kaduva was true in these words
 gangi kya jawaab detii; kintu usne vah badboodaar pani pine ko na diya
 It was nine o'clock at night
 thake-maande majdoor to so chuke the, thakur ke daravaaje par das-paanch beficre jamaa the
 There is no time or opportunity for field bravery
 kanoonee bahaduree kii baaten ho rahi thim; kitni hoshiyaari se thakur ne thanedaar ko ek khaas mukaddame main rishwat de di or saaf nikal gayi
 How foolishly they have copied the case of a marque
 najir or mohatamim, sabhi kehete the, nakal nahin mil sakati
 Someone asks for fifty; Any hundred
 yahan bepaise-kaudi nakal uda di
 Need a way of working
 isi samay gangi kuen se pani lene pahaunchi
 The flask of the flask was coming to the well
 gangi jagat kii aad main baithi maukey kaa intjaar karne lagi
 The entire village drinks the water of this well
 kisi ke liye roak nahin; sirf ye badanaseeb nahin bhar sakate
 
 gangi kaa vidrohi dil rivaaji pabandiyon or majaburiyon par chotein karne laga- ham kyon neech hai or yah log kyon oonch hai? isliye ki ye log gale main taagaa daal lete hai? yahan to jitne hai, ek-se-ek chhante hai? chori ye karen, jaal-fareb ye karen, jhuthe mukaddame ye karen
 This day the Thakur had stole a sheep of poor shepherd that day and later ate and ate it
 inhen panditji ke ghar main barhon masa jua hota he
 This Sahuji then sells oil by adding ghee
 kaam kara lete hai, majuri dete nani marati he
 What are you higher than
 haan, munh main hamase unche hai
 We do not scream street that we are tall, we are tall! Sometimes when i come to the village, i start looking with raspberries
 jaise sabaki chaati par saanp lotane lagata he, parantu ghamand yah ki ham unche hai
 There was a call for someone to come to the well
 gangi kii chaati dhak-dhak karne lagi
 If you see it somewhere, then it is amazing
 ek laat bhi to neeche na pade
 He lifted the pitcher and rope and bent down and stood in the dark shadow of a moving tree
 kab in logon ko dayaa aati he kisi par
 Poor Mahaungu was hit so much that he kept spitting blood for months
 isliye ki usne begaar na di thi! us par ye log unche banate hai
 Two women came to fill the well with water
 inamen baaten ho rahi thim
 'let's go to eat food and i am ordered to fill up with fresh water
 ghade ke liye paise nahin he
 "we are jealous of the dead as we sit comfortably
" ‚Äô‚Äòhaan, yah to na hua ki kalsia uthaakar bhar laate
 Just run the spades to get fresh water, like we are potters
 ‚Äô‚Äòlaundia nahin to or kya ho tum? roti-kapadaa nahin paatin? das-paanch rupee chin-jhapat kar le hi leti ho
 And how is Laundia
 ‚Äô‚Äòmat lajaao didi! chhin bhar aaraam karne ko ji taras kar rah jaataa he
 If she had done so much work at someone else's house, she would have been comfortable with it
 upar se vah ehsaan maanata
 Die while working here; But nobody's face is straight
 ‚Äôdonon pani bharkar chali gayin, to gangi vriksh kii chaaya se nikali or kuen ke jagat ke paas aayi
 Befikre had gone
 thakur bhi darwaja band kar andar aangan main sone ja rahe the
 Gangi breathed momentary happiness
 kisi tarah maidan to saaf hua
 The prince who once went to fetch the nectar may not have gone so carefully and wisely
 gangi dabe paanv kuen ke jagat par chadhi
 He had never experienced such a victory before
 usne rassi kaa fanda ghade main dhaala
 Looked at the right-left watch, as if a soldier was making a hole in the enemy's fort at night
 agar is samay vah pakad lee gayi, to phir uske liye maafee yaa riayat kii ratti-bhar ummid nahin
 Finally, by remembering the gods, he strengthened the heart and put the pot in the well
 ghade ne pani main ghota lagaaya, bahut hi aahista
 There was no voice at all
 gangi ne do chaar haath jaldi-jaldi maare
 The pot reached from the well to the mouth
 koi bada shahazor pahalwaan bhi itani teji se use na khinch saktaa tha
 Gangi bent down and held the pot and placed it on the world, that the door of Thakur saheb opened suddenly
 sher kaa munh isse adhik bhayanak na hoga
 Gangi lost the rope from her hand
 rassi ke saath gadaa dhadaam se pani main gira or kai kshan tak pani main halakore kii awaajen sunai detii raheen
 Who is Thakur, who?' Calls were coming towards the well and being jumped from the Gangi world, ran home and saw that Jokhu Lota was drinking the same dirty and dirty water
