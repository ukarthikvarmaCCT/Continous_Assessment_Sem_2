 This cloud of crisis is hovering over the rebellion of 16 mlas on the Congress and the JDS government, although one rebel MLA has announced to vote in favor of the government, while the rest of the rebel mlas claim that they have sworn by Sai Baba is
 is bich kumaraswami sarkaar bachaane ke liye aakhri koshish bhi jari he
 MLC BM Farooq, close to Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, has sent his special Shahid to Mumbai
 shahid ne mumbai ke hotel main jaakar jedies ke baagi vidhayakon or ramesh jaarkiholi se mulaakaat kii
 However, what is the stand of the rebel mlas after this meeting, it is not clear yet
 isse pehle supreme court ne buudhvaar ko apane faisle main ye kahkar kumaraswami sarkaar ko tagada jhatka de diya ki baagi vidhayakon par vip lagu nahin hoga
 However, the Supreme Court empowered Speaker Ramesh Kumar to decide on the resignation of the mlas
 is bich sabaki nigahen spikar ke faisle par bhi tiki hai
 The fate of these 15 rebel mlas will be decided by the 15 mlas who have submitted their resignations to the speaker, in which Congress, JDS k h Vishwanath, r Roshan Baig, Ramesh Jharkholi, Anand Singh, ST Somashekhar, Bairathi Basavaraj, n Muniratna, BC Patil , Pratap Gowda Patil, Shivram Hebbar, Mahesh Kumtahalli, MTB Nagaraj, k Sudhakar, Narayan Gowda, k Gopalaiya
 haalanki, congress ke baagi vidhayak ramalinga reddy ne sarkaar ke paksh main vot karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The Kumaraswamy Sarkar Karnataka CM CM Kumaraswamy would have to understand the number game of Karnataka to know if the Kumaraswamy government would be able to prove a majority

 That is, if 16 rebel mlas did not join the vote of confidence today, then only 208 mlas will be left in the house
 bahumat ke liye 105 vidhayakon kii darkaar hogi, lekin sirf 101 vidhayak hone se kumaraswami vishwaas mat haar jaaenge
 a rebel MLA can vote against the government
 Another situation may arise today during the vote of confidence
 agar 16 baagi vidhayakon ne sarkaar ke khilaaf vot kiya to sarkaar ke paksh main sirf 101 vot padenge jabaki khilaaf main 123 wo jaaenge
 That means even then the Kumaraswamy government will be defeated

 uttar korian sharnaarthi ke bete or sudhaarwadi netaa moon satta kii kaman sanbhaalane ke baad sabase pehle uttar korea ke taanashaah kim jong un ke saath baatcheet shuru karenge
 Let us know that former President Park Goon Hee ended all relations with North Korea
 saath hi uttar korea par puri tarah se pratibandh laga diya tha
 Park Jaun-hee was dismissed on corruption charges in March, following which Moon Jae-in's victory has come to light
 yah jeet korian prayadweep main america dakhal ko khatm karne kii disha main ahm maani ja rahi he
 Moon, who favors a better relationship with North Korea, has also praised US President Donald Trump's statement that he had spoken to North Korean dictator Kim
 america virdohi party ke netaa hai moonmoon ke aane ke baad se america kii tension bhi bad gai he
 Perhaps this is the reason why US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Vice President Mike Pence visited South Korea immediately after Park Geun-hee's sacking amid tensions with North Korea
 moon kii party ko america virdohi mana jaataa he
 Human rights activist Moon himself is a staunch critic of America
 aise main unke saamne dakshin korea main america dakhal ko rokane kii bhi badi chunauti he
 The US has deployed the Thad anti-missile system in South Korea, which is being much debated
 moon bhi isaki aalochana kar chuke hai
 Tensions with the US have also increased due to North Korea conducting nuclear and missile tests
 korian prayadweep main yuddh ke halaat bane hue he
 In the mood to teach America a lesson, North Korea: The American intelligence agency CIA has tried to assassinate North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, which has angered North Korea with its determination to teach America a lesson
 aise main yah jeet uttar korea ke paksh main maani ja rahi he
 However, if there was war, more Korean countries would suffer losses than the US
 aise main tanaav ko khatm karnaa moon ke liye badi chunauti he
 Trump's unequivocal policy: The fact is that US President Donald Trump has no clear policy regarding the two Korean countries
 haalanki dakshin korea ke saath america ke sainya sambandh majaboor maane jate hai, lekin is jeet se yah najariya bhi kamjor hota dikh rahaa he
 Actually, the US is trying to stop North Korea's nuclear program like Iran and wants to put it on the negotiating bench, which is not possible
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad or america pratibandh ke chalate iran ko america ke saamne jhukna padaa tha, jisaki vajah yah thi ki uske paas paryaapt sansaadhan nahin the, lekin uttar korea ke saath aisi koi samasya nahin he
 The dictator Kim Jong Un is fully aware of US diplomacy
 dhimi padi arthvyavastha ko durust karne kii bhi chunautiuttar korian sharnaarthi ke bete moon ke saamne dakshin korea kii arthvyavastha ko durust karnaa, bhrashtachar kaa khaatmaa karnaa or berogari kii samasya se nipatna jaisi chunautiyaan hai
 In recent times, corruption has increased rapidly in South Korea
 park goon-he khud bhrashtachar ke aarope main jail main band hai
 Apart from this, South Korea is the fourth largest economy in Asia, which has now increased the problem of generating employment

 In 1960, South Korea was considered the poorest country, but it has progressed recently

 hindi film jagat main kumud kumaar ganguli ke naam se log bhale hi log parichit na hon, lekin ashok kumaar or dada muni ke naam se sinejagat or sine premi acchhee tarah parichit hai
 The character of the cigar-blowing and smiling figure in the films of the 80s and 90s had become a well-known and familiar character for the audience, such as the films
 somvaar, 13 oktober ko pyaare dada muni kaa janmdin he
 He was born on 13 October 1911 in Bhagalpur, Bihar, into a middle-class Bengali family
 peshey se vakil kunjalaal ganguli ke bade bete ashok kumaar aage chalakar apane chote bhaaiyon anup kumaar or kishor kumaar ke liye bhi film jagat main kariyar banane kii prerana bane
 Chalti's name Garamashoor playback singer Kishore Kumar had also admitted in many of his interviews that he got inspiration from not only acting, but also singing, from his elder brother, because Ashok used to sing singing rites through him from childhood
 Had come teenon bhaaiyon ne film ‘chalati kaa naam gaadi’ main saath kaam bhi kiya tha jo superhit rahi thi
 Although Ashok Kumar wanted to enter the film field from the beginning, but he wanted to become a successful film director, not an actor
 1934 main ashok kumaar ne mumbai ke new theatre main bataur leboratory sahaayak kaam karnaa shuru kiya tha
 Later, his brother-in-law and friend Shashidhar Mukherjee invited him to work at the Bombay Talkies Studio near him
 hero ke biimaar hone ke baad paar lagi ‘jivan naiya’ashok kumaar ke abhinay ke kshetra main kadam rakhane kii ghatana kisi filmi kahani se kam nahin thi
 In 1936, Najm ul Hasan, the protagonist of Bombay Talkies Studio's film Jeevan Naiya, suddenly fell ill and the company was in trouble
 tab studio ke maalik himanshu raay kii najar aakarshak laboratory sahaayak ashok kumaar par padi or unhone film main nayak kii bhoomika nibhaane kaa unhen prastaav diya
 Ashok Kumar's acting journey started from here
 ek actor ke taur par ashok kumaar ne acting kii prachlit shaileyon ko darkinar kar apni swaabhaavik style viksit kii
 He never bothered to experiment and take risks in acting and for the first time he started the anti-hero character in Hindi cinema
 'jivan naiya' ke baad unki agali film 'achhut kanya' thi
 'untouchable Girl' released in 1937 was a huge success
 is film ne ashok kumaar ko hindi film jagat ke bade sitaron kii shrenee main laa khadaa kiya
 Madhubala and Lata Mangeshkar were elevated and later, under the banner of Bombay Talkies, Production Chief Ashok Kumar made many films like 'mashal', 'stubborn' and 'forced'

 pichley dinon soshal media kii ek khabar ne khub dhooma machaai, jisamen ek pati ne apnipatni ke saath sambandhonko lekar ek note taiyaar kiya tha
 In that note, he counted the moments in 7 weeks when he came very close to his wife and both felt the love of love
 us shaks ne naaraazgi jataate hue likhaa tha ki uski patni ne uske shaareerik sambandh banane ke prastaav ko 27 thukraayaa or is vajah se vah bahut dukhi he
 With time, this is one such problem of marital life that comes in front of every couple lately
 lekin samajhadaari isi main he ki is pareshaani ko jhelane kii bajaay isse jald se jald suljhaayaa jaae
 According to experts, having an occasional relationship in a husband-wife relationship is as important as food to stay alive
 yah na sirf do logon ko shaareerik rup se paas laata he balki isse bhaavnaatmak bandhan bhi majboot hota he
 Grievances go away and newness in relationships remains
 kab or kitni baalpani samasya lekar exparts ke paas jane vaale danpati aksar yah sawaal karte hai ki hafte menkitani baar or kabashaareerik sambandh bananaa sahi he
 Actually it has no meter
 yah vyaktitv par nirbhar karata he ki aap kitni baar sambandh bananaa chaahate hai or kab
 Therefore it is better to discard such concerns
 ek research ke mutabik, 18-19 saal kii umr menkapalsasaal main 112 se adhik baar shaareerik sambandh banaate hai
 In the age group of 30-39 years, this figure is reduced to 80-86 times and in the age range of 40-49 years it further decreases to 66-69
 relationships exparts maanate hai ki sambandh banane ke kram main umr ke saath aakande ke ghatane kaa ek kaaran is ore aruchi yaa vyast jeevanstyli ho sakati he
 But it is also worth noting that with this or say that with increasing age, problems in this relationship also start in marital relationships
 shikaayatein aati hai ki unka partner ab unka khyal nahin rakhata
 That is, the most important physical relationship is preferred more than pleasure
 thik vaise hi jaise aap bhojan ko jaruri maanate hai
 What to do with anorexia? Many people complain that its partner is not very interested in building relationships
 agar aisa he to is ore aapako chup rahane kii bajaay aapas main baat karne kii jarurat he
 If you want, you can also talk to your partner in the bedroom bar
 shaareerik sambandh banane ke baad yaa usase pehle kabhi bhi apane partner se yah zikr nahin karen ki yah jarurat he isliye aap kar rahe hai
 Rather let them feel love
 unhen bataaen ki aap unase pyaar karte hai or unhen apana sabakuch saunpna chaahate hai
 In order to make a connection between likes and dislikes, it is most important that you understand each other's likes and dislikes, know and talk on it
 jaruri nahin ki jo poshchar aapako pasand he vah aapke partner ko bhi pasand aae
 Try to understand when and how your partner feels more pleasure
 in muddon par khulkar baat karen
 There is no better medicine or exercise than sex to relieve day-to-day fatigue or worries
 isliye ise itani bhi gambhirtha se nahin len
 Maintain a slightly light mood
 har din kuch nayaa karne kii sochen
 Something interesting and something that will enjoy both you and your partner
 tulana naa karempane partner kii kisi se kabhi tulana naa karen
 Understand if he is doing or is doing something new
 anand kaa anubhav nahin kar rahe hai to uske prayaas kii saraahna karte hue usamen apni ore se bhi kuch joden
 Loving and maintaining love is no rocket science
 jarurat he to bas ek-duusare ko samajhane kii

 shivaji ne badshaah se kaha tha ki shahjahan, jahangir or akbar bhi is kar ko laga sakate the 'parantu unhone apane dilon main kattarta ko jagah nahin di kyonki unka maananaa tha ki har bade athwa chote insaan ko ishwar ne vibhinn maton or swabhaavon ke namoonon ke rup main banaaya he
 There is a message in this 17th century letter from Shivaji, which is universal
 ise vartmaan samay main hamaare aacharan kaa maargdarshan karne vaala jeevant dastavej ban janaa chahie
 We cannot afford to forget this message at a time when the increasingly turbulent international environment has created threats in our region and beyond, some of which are visible in full and some in the midst of unprecedented turmoil

 Our right to freedom is continuously flourishing and i wish it always be so, but what will happen to our duty to the people? i sometimes wonder if our democracy has become too noisy? Have we lost the art of thoughtfulness and peaceful thinking? Is not the time now that we should reestablish the superiority and pride of our institutions that maintain and strengthen our beautiful democracy? Shouldn't Parliament once again become a great institution of laws created by serious brainstorming and good debate? Shouldn't our courts become a temple of justice? All this will require collective efforts of all the partners

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni praised the performance of his bowlers in the first Test cricket match against England on a flat pitch
 bharat ne pehali pari main 457 ran banaae or duusari pari nau wicket par 391 ran banaakar samaapt ghoshit kii
 England scored 496 runs in their only innings
 dhoni ne kaha, ham pich par niyantran nahin kar sakate
 We did what we could and it was a very positive aspect for us in this match
 unhone kaha, is tarah kii pich par gendbaajon ne bahut acha pradarshan kiya
 Even on 160 overs, he tried hard
 unamem se prayek ne lagbhag 25 se 30 se 35 over kiye or phir bhi unhone khud par thakaan haaavee nahin hone di
 Dhoni said, overall our batting looks good
 murali vijay ne acha pradarshan kiya or anya kaa pradarshan bhi acha rahaa
 Some batsmen make a great start in their careers and spend some time
 yah hameshaa parinaam se judaa nahin hota he
 If you look at the last few tours, then our batsmen have improved a lot
 match ke dauraan pich charchaa kaa vishay bani rahi tathaa isse gendbaajon ko madad nahin mili
 Bhuvneshwar Kumar scored two half-centuries while Stuart Binny, Mohammed Shami and James Anderson were successful in completing half-centuries for the first time
 anderson ne jo root ke saath aakhri wicket ke liye 198 ran kii saajhedaari bhi kii
 He said, in South Africa you want to play on a fast wicket and do well
 england main aap aisi pich or paristhitiyaan chaahate ho jo swing gendbaaji ke anukool hon
 It is expected that the wickets will be more lively in further matches
 binni ne apane pehle test match main ardhashatak jamaakar bharat ko sankat se baahar nikaala
 He also had two half-century partnerships with Ravindra Jadeja and Bhubaneswar
 dhoni ne kaha, binni or ravindra jadeja ke bich saajhedaari kaaphi mahatvapurn rahi
 Then there was half a day of play remaining and we did not score enough runs
 us samay ham sangharsh kar rahe the
 Then we wanted him to bat well and he did it
 hamaare adhiktar khilaadiyon ko dabaav main ballebaaji karne or match bachaane kaa anubhav nahin he isliye yah match unke liye acha anubhav rahaa
 Regarding Binny's role, he said, "binny's role was affected because the wicket was not suited to his bowling style
" jadeja sapaat pich par gendbaaji kar rahaa tha isliye maine binni ko adhik over nahin dene kaa faisla kiya
 Dhoni said, "we don't play with five bowlers abroad, but in the past, our bowling has suffered
" isliye yadi hamen paanch gendbaajon, chaahe vah binni ho yaa aar aswin, ke saath khelnaa he to ballebaajon ko adhik jimmedaari leni hogi

 Last year, Jharcraft has set a new record by doing business of 80 crores
 dhirendra kumaar ne kaha, 'sarkaar ne yah sochakar mujhe laayaa ki ham yahaan ke halaat sudhaarenge
 Today we are the largest producer of tasar in the country
 ''go organic' yahi mantra he dhirendra kumaar kaa
 They believe that without artificial measures, production can also be increased by the use of natural methods
 yahi vajah he ki jharkhand main silk kaa utpaadan jo saal 2005 main kareeb 90 mitric ton kaa tha, 2012 main badhkar 1025 mitric ton tak pahunch gaya, jabaki unka apana anumaan 900 mitric ton kaa hi tha
 According to an estimate, around 44,000 weavers, 50 thousand handcraft workers and 16 thousand spinners have joined Jharcraft
 saath hi jharcraft kareeb saadhe teen lakh logon ko bhi vyavsaay de rahi he
 Not only this, Jharcraft is providing monthly business of 4 to 5 thousand rupees to thousands of rural women under BPL
 dhirendra kumaar bataate hai, 'sarkaar kii yah ichha thi ki tasar ko aage badhaakar bade paimaane par rojgaar paidaa kiya jaae
 'dhirendra's tireless efforts are now visible on the ground too
 cericulture ne saal vrikshon ko nayaa jivan diya he, kyonki silk ke keet inhen pedo par apana baseraa banaate hai, jisaki vajah se graminon ne ab tak 2 lakh hectare se adhik kaa jangal sangrakshit kar liya he
 Jharcraft has created 'samrudhi', a spinner machine powered by solar energy, which helps in wrapping silk threads
 yahi nahin, saamaajik kalyaan kaaryakramon main swasthya suraksha ke tahat 75 hajaar graminon ko swasthya sevaayen bhi di ja rahi hai
 It is not that Dhirendra got all this easily
 iske liye unhone athak prayaas kiya
 Aroused the confidence in people
 inke kaamon kii badaulat jo gramin pehle sharaab ke nashe main pade rahete the, ve ab kaam main lage hai
 Their children are now going to school too
 yah misaal he ki kaise ek aadmi ne apni yojana ko saakaar karte hue, mehnat ke boote sarkari kshetra ke ek upkram kii safalataa kii gaatha likh daali
 Are we in trouble with our nuclear weapons? Is India's nuclear weapon not as effective as we have believed or as claimed by the government? a scientist associated with the second nuclear test in Pokhran has shocked everyone by saying that the hydrogen bomb test was not completely successful
 parmaanu shakti sampann bharat13 may 1998 ko pokharan main dharti ke neeche uthi ek halchal ne puri duniya ko hilaakar rakh diya tha
 The world was still trying to figure out the power of this blast that Pokharan's earth was shaken once again
 bharat ne do or parmaanu pareekshan kar daale
 These five blasts, which took place 24 years after the first nuclear test, brought India into the ranks of the few countries in the world that have effective and reliable technology for atomic bombs
 kam se kam sarkaar ne daawa to yahi kiya
 But this is only half true
 ye hakeekat kaa sirf ek pahalu he
 The second aspect is what Santhanam of a scientist who is closely associated with this nuclear test is saying
 oparation shakti ke baad sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki is pareekshan ke jariye bharat ne parmaanu bam kii puri takanic hasil kar lee he
 And not only the nuclear fusion bomb, but he has also tried the formula of making hydrogen bomb several times more powerful
 bharat ke paas sirf paramparaagat parmaanu bam kii hi taknicolekin pokharan-2 ke 11 saal baad parmaanu vaigyanik ke santhanum kaa daawa hamaare is mugalate ko todane ke liye kaaphi he
 According to k Santhanam, India has only the technology of nuclear fusion bomb i
e
 conventional nuclear bomb
 hamaare paas fusion bam yani ki taqatvar hydrogen bam kii bharosemand takanic nahin he
 Santhanam claims that the thermonuclear device tested in Pokhran-2 did not meet expectations
 ke santhanum ke daawey ko nazarandaaj karnaa mumkin nahin kyonki santhanum bharat ke duusare daur ke parmaanu pareekshan yani pokharan-2 ke koordinator the or santhanum ke daawey par yakeen karen to bharat parmaanu hathiyaar sampann baaki deshon ke mukaable ab bhi kaaphi peeche he
 India is surrounded by threats from all sides, India is surrounded by neighbors armed with nuclear weapons
 aise main santhanum kaa chaunkaane vaala khulaasa is sawaal ke saath bhi jud gaya he ki kya bharat ke parmaanu hathiyaar pakistan se bhi kamatar hai
 Because it is not hidden from anyone that Pakistan's nuclear weapon is actually an imitation of China
 china or pakistan donon se hui he jangbharat ateet main china or pakistan donon ke saath jang lard chukaa he
 India's relationship with Pakistan is well known and China has been constantly trying to intimidate
 aise main bharat ke paas kargar parmaanu hathiyaar kii takanic ke nahin hone kii khabar aisi he jise khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa
 China has mastered China, along with nuclear fusion bombs, it has also mastered making fusion or hydrogen bomb, and according to experts, with the help of China, Pakistan has also tested the technology of hydrogen bomb
 bharat ke parmaanu kaarykram menkai badi kamiyambharat ke pokharan-2 parmaanu kaarykram se jude vaigyanik ke santhanum kii maane to hamaare parmaanu kaarykram main ab bhi kai badi kamiyaan he
 And the need is to make it more sharp
 ke santhanum ke mutabik hydrogen bam kii takanic aisi nahin ki ek pareekshan main koi isamen mahajeth hasil kar le
 In this case, further testing of thermonuclear devices is needed
 parmaanu pareekshan nahin karne kaa elaanbharat ke pokharan-2 parmaanu abhiyaan se jude ke santhanum kaa maananaa he ki newcleear fusion bam kii takanic tabhi puri tarah kargar maani ja sakati he jab duniya bhar main maujuud sismik divaais is baat kii tasdik karen
 And India has more or less failed in the first test
 lekin gauratlab he ki bharat ne aage or parmaanu pareekshan nahin karne kaa elaan kar rakhaa he
 In such a situation, doubts will remain about our nuclear preparations
 'banga vibhushan' puraskaar ke liye chaynit kiya gaya lata mangeshkar kaa naam Bollywood actress Preity Zinta is such a huge fan of 'god of Cricket' Sachin Tendulkar that on seeing Sachin, Preity's toothache got sore

 The Indian team may be worried about the bowlers' relentless performance against New Zealand, but despite this, they are unlikely to land with five bowlers in the third and final Test starting on November 20 as the number seven captain in the batting order Mahendra Singh Dhoni always likes to have six specialist batsmen in the playing XI
 dhoni ne jab se captaini sanbhali he tab se bharat kisi bhi match main paanch gendbaajon ke saath nahin utraa
 Now Indian bowling looks more weak due to the injury of Zaheer Khan but there is every possibility that India will come on the field with two fast bowlers and two spinners
 purv captain ravi shastri kaa haalanki maananaa he ki bharat ko paanch gendbaajon ke saath utarana chahie kyonki harbhajan singh acchhee ballebaaji kar rahe hai
 He recently said, "zaheer Khan is unfit, so India should keep Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra and Pragyan Ojha in the team
" ’ dhoni haalanki isse ittefaq nahin rakhte kyonki unka maananaa he ki bharat chaar gendbaajon ke saath khilne main adhik sahaj mahasoos karata he
 He said after the second Test match in Hyderabad, "it can be an option but we mostly go with four bowlers
 ’ dhoni ne ab tak 20 maichon main bharat kii kaman sanbhali he lekin inamen se kisi bhi match main bharat paanch gendbaajon ke saath nahin utraa
 In fact, in the last two years, the Indian team has never had five bowlers in the playing XI
 bhartiya team main srisanth, irfan pathan, aar pi singh, anil kumble or harbhajan singh ke rup main paanch gendbaaj the lekin dakshin africa ne saat wicket par 494 ran thok daale the
 On the other hand, India lacked a batsman and Akhri and his team could score only 76 and 328 runs
 isse pehle janvari 2008 main austrailia ke khilaaf edilade main bhi bharat paanch gendbaajon ke saath utraa tha lekin tab irfan pathan ne salaami ballebaaj kii bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Australia had scored 563 runs then and the match was drawn
 bharat ne pichley do saal ke andar sabhi match main chaar gendbaaj rakhe
 In most of these matches, Zaheer and Ishant were part of the team
 is bich haalanki tej gendbaajon main munaf patel, es srisanth or abhimanya mithun jabaki spinneron main harbhajan ke alaava pragyan ojha or amit mishra ne bhi kuch match khele
 Dhoni, however, liked Ishant or Sreesanth with Zaheer in fast bowling and Ojha with Harbhajan in spinners
 harbhajan or ojha milakar nau match main bhartiya spin akraman kii jimmedaari sambhaal chuke hai
 Sreesanth and Ishant can start bowling in the absence of Zaheer in Nagpur
 team main haalanki yuva tej gendbaaj jayadev unadakat ko bhi liya gaya he
 Team India captain Virat Kohli, who is in great form, once again tasted the South African bowlers
 unhone capatoun main na sirf apane kariyar kaa 34waan vanade shatak lagaaya, balki africa dharti par naabad 160 ranon kii pari khelkar sachin tendulkar ko peeche chhod diya
 Indeed, Virat has become the Indian batsman to have played the biggest ODI innings in South Africa
 isse pehle yah record sachin ke naam tha, jinhone 2003 main namibia ke khilaaf 152 ranon kii pari kheli thi
 Virat hit 12 fours and two sixes during the innings of 159 balls, due to which Team India scored a big score of 303 / 6

 He further cemented his record
 viraat ne is maamle main rahul dravid, quinton di cock, rohit sharma ko pich choda he, jinke naam 4-4 baar yah uplabdhi hasil karne kaa record rahaa
 Virat has scored 318 runs in this bilateral series with two centuries (112, 46 *, 160 *)

 Earlier, he scored 138 against South Africa in Chennai in 2015
 -viraat ne apni shatkeey pari main 159 genden khelin, jo unke vanade kariyar main sarvaadhik he
 Earlier, he had played 148 balls against Pakistan in Dhaka in 2012 and scored 183 runs
 -videshi dharti par captain ke taur par viraat ke 160 * ranon kii pari kapil dev ke baad sabase badi pari he
 Kapil played an unbeaten 175-run knock during the 1983 World Cup against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge Wells
 -viraat kohli ne captain ke taur 12waan vanade shatak lagaaya, ab unase riki ponting or abi divilliars hi aage hai, jinke naam kramshah 22 or 13 shatak hai
 ODI captain: Most centuries 22 Ricky Ponting (220 innings) 13 AB de Villiers (98 innings) 12 Virat Kohli (43 innings) 11 Sourav Gangli (143 innings) bhartiya janata party ke navaniyukt adhyaksh nitin gadakari kaa kahana he ki laalkrishna adwani bhaajapa sansadeey dal ke adhyaksh bane rahane ke saath saath party ke liye ek pathpradarshak or vichaarak kii bhoomika nibhaate rahenge
 Gadkari said that Atal Bihari Vajpayee and LK Advani are our inspiration
 adwani ji party ke sthai pathpradarshak or vichaarak kii bhoomika nibhaate rahenge
 He was asked whether his role would be limited to the bjp's parliamentary affairs after Advani was appointed to the post of BJP Parliamentary Party President
 adwani ne gat 18 disambar ko loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa kaa pad chhod diya tha
 He did this after attacks from within the party after the party's worrying performance in the general election
 iske baad unhen party sansadeey dal kaa adhyaksh bana diya gaya tha jisase aisa lagane laga tha ki unki bhoomika vahiin tak simit ho gai he
 Gadkari, who emerged for the first time on the national political scene, does not consider it unviable but instead he believes that getting this post will be valuable for him and he will never be prejudiced
 gat 18 disambar ko gadakari kii niyukti aise samay hui he jab mana ja rahaa he ki party kaaphi bure daur se guzar rahi thi or use ubaarane ke liye kuch thos upayon kii jarurat mahasoos kii ja rahi thi
 Gadkari will present a blueprint in this regard in the next three months

 Tensions have increased over the speech of a woman who was in a Sikh get-up at a conference held in the park, despite the student authorities' student for society (SFS) not giving permission from the University authorities on Friday at Punjab University Chandigarh
 ABVP kaa aarope he ki sikh geoup main ai ye mahila seemaa aaazaad thi
 Significantly, Seema Azad and her husband have been sentenced to life imprisonment by a local court in Allahabad in a sedition case for supporting Maoist organizations
 vah philhalailahabaad hoicortse mili bel par baahar hai
 The student organization ABVP was continuously opposing Seema Azad's Punjab University to come and give speeches on the sfs's call, but despite this, the woman who came in the Sikh get-up gave a speech and the ABVP workers are calling this woman as Seema Azad
 
 ABVP kii taraf se uniwarsity main ek video bhi viral kiya gaya he, jisamen ye sikh geoup main ai mahila SFS ke protest sammelan main bhaashan de rahi he
 Not only this, the SFS also claims that Seema Azad was the only woman who came to the Sikh get-up and gave a speech at his Protest Conference
 haalanki uniwarsity prashasan or chandigarh police kii koshish thi ki seemaa aaazaad is kaarykram main aakar bhaashan na de paaen, kyonki aisa hone se uniwarsity kii lau and order kii sthiti bigadane kii ashanka thi
 But at present, the SFS claims that Seema Azad has attended her conference despite all the security and hooliganism of ABVP
 lekin ye sab kuch itane gup-chup tareeke se hua ki is baat kaa aadhikarik conformation koi nahin de paa rahaa
 Earlier, despite the absence of permission from the Punjab University Administration, the tension in the campus has remained since Friday morning due to the conference convened by SFS in the park
 prashasan ne bhi bahari chaatro ke campus main aane par roak laga di thi
 Despite this, many students from other colleges and universities reached the gate of Punjab University in support of SFS, but when they were not allowed inside, they sat on a dharna outside, after which the Chandigarh police took these students into custody and got up Upholstered, filled in trains and removed from the university gate

 The driver said that many times he has given information about the poor condition of the engine of the trains to the higher authorities, but neither the glass underwater stopped nor the roofs of the engine dripped

 The driver has now made his union aware of this problem
 wo bhi yah kehete hue ki wo duty ke dauraan rojaanaa ingine ke bheetar hi naha rahe hai

 pehali baar 3 janvari, 1969 ko nagpur main bala sahib thakare kii mulaakaat tatkaaleen sarasanghachaalak guru golwalkar or sarkarywah devaras se hui thi
 Although Bala Saheb had left Bombay to deliver a speech at the Vidyarthi Sangh's conference at Nagpur Vidyapeeth, the CPM had threatened that Thackeray would not be able to return alive from Nagpur, so the Sangh swung into action and went to Mahal's town hall to protect Thackeray One thousand volunteers sat as spectators
 us vakït pramod navalkar, sudhir joshi or manohar joshi samet 12 shivasainik thakare ke bodyguard ban kar gaye the
 In the manner in which Thackeray referred to Marathi manoos to Hindu nationalism in that speech at the town hall, the RSS never felt that Balasaheb was not a RSS volunteer
 phir, beete 45 varshon main donon siyasat kaa rang itnaa gadha ho gaya ki kisi ne sochaa tak nahin ki dosti main lahraane vaala bhagava paracham kabhi dushmani main bant jayega
 Now this enmity is spoiling the equation of power in Maharashtra
 sangh main to aaj bhi lakh take kaa sawaal yahi he ki bijepi apane boote satta saadh le yaa chunaav ke baad shivasena ke saath milakar sarkaar banaae
 His dilemma is that if his volunteers become active for the BJP, the Sangh branches may also come under the Shiv Sena's target
 isi se swayamsevak hindu votaron main vot ke liye utsaah bharne main to lage hai magar bijepi ko vot dene ke sidhe zikr se batch rahe hai
 In this context, the Maharashtra election is an acid test for the Narendra modi-amit Shah duo in which the Sangh's credibility with the Shiv Sena is at stake
 is maheen raajnneeti ko uddhav thakare bhi samajh rahe hai or modi bhi
 That is why Uddhav is chanting Hinduism, then Modi is shouting slogans of development
 shivasena or bijepi kisi ek mudde par talwaar bhaanjane ko taiyaar hai to vah shivaji kii viraasat he
 It cannot be denied that this struggle can feed a new gull in the politics of Maharashtra
 modi kaa mizaaj unhen afjal khan tehraane vaale ko chunaav ke baad kii majaburi main bhi saath lene par raji hoga, iskaa jawaab mushkil he
 Within the RSS, the upshot is that the party, organization and ideas should not be viewed from the perspective of political victory and defeat
 lekin modi kii aguai main bijepi jis raste par nikal padi he usamen sangh ke liye koi vikalp bhi nahin he
 That is why anyone can get the most benefit from it, then it is NCP
 ensipi ke jo sardaar beete pandrah baras kii satta main khalanaayak ho chale the, vah jhtke main apni panji ke aasare nayak ban gaye hai
 Actually, Sharad Pawar's party has been running around the most powerful leaders of every district
 so, ghotaalon kii jo lambii pherahist bijepi har din modi kii tasviir ke saath dainik akhabaaron main panne bhar ke vigyaapan ke jariye chhap rahi he, vah beasar ho chali he
 Nobody is now eyeing the congress-ncp's ruling power
 votaron kii najar bijepi or shivasena ke sangharsh par aa tiki he
 70 thousand crores ahead of it
 ke sinchai ghotaale yaa adarsh ghotaale kii baaten bemaja ho gai hai
 Everyone is interested in whether the BJP will reach power or the Shiv Sena
 chunavi sameekaran isi se ban-bighad rahaa he
 That is why the Shiv Sena needs Gujarati and Marathi to collide in Mumbai, while the BJP is hoping that the Marathi manus should go with the Gujaratis for employment and development
 uddhav thakare is sach ko samajh rahe hai ki mumbai or pashchimi maharashtra main based gujarati ab thakaregiri par nahin chalenge kyonki unhen dilli kii satta main baithe gujarati modi dikhaai de rahe hai
 But Modi's crisis is double
 ek taraf ve maharashtra ko bantane na dene kii kasam kha rahe hai lekin alag vidarbha ke bijepi ke naare ko chupaana bhi nahin chaah rahe he
 In fact, in the Lok Sabha elections, bjp-shiv Sena was ahead in 59 seats out of the 62 seats of Vidarbha in the air, while in the assembly elections, the BJP has a dream of winning 45 seats on its own
 isaki vajah vidarbha rajya banane kaa vaada he
 But if this voice gets louder, then the regional forces of Konkan and Marathwada, from Maratha to Kunbi and OBC can shift from BJP, based on which they have formed the trust of Pramod Mahajan and Gopinath Munde in collaboration with Balasaheb Thackeray
 modi or amit shah isiilie check and balance kaa khel khel rahe hai
 Modi is openly praising Devendra Fadnavis, who is contesting from Nagpur, and is taking the name of Amit Shah Pankaja Munde
 fadavis vidarbha kaa raag alaap rahe hai or pankaja mahajan-munde kii jodi ko yaad kar marathavada main bijepi kii soshal ejiniyanksharag barkaraar rakhane kii jaddojahad main lagi hai
 The Shiv Sena is also understanding the truth of social engineering
 uddhav bhaashanon main mahajan-munde ke saath rishton kii ankahi kahani bataanaa nahin bhoolatey
 His eyes are on Maratha, Kunbi and OBC vote banks
 shivasena iske liye manch par munde kii tasviir lagane se bhi nahin chook rahi he
 Narendra Modi is trying to reverse the 15-year rule of the ncp-congress government by stating the rule of scams and loot, but now 37 candidates who have come out of congress-ncp are contesting on BJP ticket
 iske alaava 14 ummidavaar duusare dalon se bijepi main ghuse hai
 At the same time, 27 leaders who are with the BJP are contesting on the ticket of the BJP with which the Shiv Sena has to give two hands
 yahaan tak ki devendra fadavis ke kareebi mitra or bijepi ke kaaryakarta totavani shivasena kii tikat par unheen ke khilaaf morche par dat gaye hai
 The contest is four-pronged, so Totwani's Sindhi constituency can blossom through 15,000 Sindhi votes and where the scale of the conflict has come is a vivid example of this

 The Speaker said - The motion for breach of privilege is under consideration
 On the morning of the commencement of the House proceedings on Monday morning, the Opposition members stood in their places and wanted to know about the notice of breach of privilege presented against the alleged misleading of the House in the Rohit Vemula case
 loksabhaa adhyaksh sumitra mahajan ne kaha tha, ‘mujhe smriti irani ke khilaaf 26 or 29 farvari kaa visheshadhikaar hanan kaa notice mila he

 ' The crime branch has solved the murder of 4 people of the same family kidnapped from Wazirabad area of delhi
 dilli police kii krime branch team ne is maamle main abhishek naam ke ek shaks ko giraftaar kiya he
 Please tell that in 2016 a girl named Naina was murdered
 uttar pradesh police ne naina kaa shav car samet ek nahar se baraamad kiya tha
 When the police started investigating the matter, all the family members of the deceased girl were found missing from the house
 upi police iske baad isko honor kiling kaa maamla samaj baithi
 The police considered Naina's father Vedprakash, mother Sadhana and brother Shubham as murderers in this case
 or cese ko honor kiling maanakar jaanch padtaal karti rahi
 (accused caught) This whole incident was done by Abhishek along with his companions
 isse pehle upi police ne bataaya tha ki parivaar ke mukhiya veda prakaash ne apni beti samet puure parivaar kaa khaatmaa kar diya
 But now Delhi Police is describing Ved Prakash as a victim
 police ke mutabik abhishek ne apane saathi bawalaa or kuch or aropiyon ke saath milakar ek-ek karke parivaar ke chaar logon ko khatm kiya or uske baad unke shavon ko hapur kii apaar canal ganga main phenk diya
 The incident took place in July 2016
 aaropee abhishek ne jurm kaboolavahin dilli police ko is puri vaardaat main abhishek ke shaamil hone kii soochna mili
 Based on the information, the police arrested him
 police ne jab usase sakhti se poochtacha kii to usne jurm kabuula kar liya
 He told that he conspired with his partner Bavla and Ved Prakash's relative Sonu
 darasal veda prakaash ne abhishek or ritesh ko paisa de rakhaa tha
 Ritesh once used to work at Ved Prakash's garment shop but these people were not returning the money
 is baat ko lekar veda prakaash khafa the
 Abhishek then conspired and involved local criminal Bawla to carry out the crime
 teenon kaa plan parivaar kihatyakarke property par kabja karne kaa tha
 Under the plan, Abhishek bought the weapon and then took Ved Prakash with him on some pretext
 iske baad vah bawalaa ke saath milakar veda prakaash kii hatya kar di
 Darsal Ved Prakash was seen by son Shubham while going with Abhishek
 ab usne shubham ko bhi bahaane se apane saath bulaayaa or uski bhi hatya kar di
 After killing the wife and daughter too, Abhishek called Ved Prakash's wife Sadhana and his daughter Naina from the house one by one on the pretext and killed them too and then threw the four dead bodies into the Upper Canal Ganga
 uttar pradesh police ne is maamle main veda prakaash kii beti naina kii gaadi baraamad kar lee thi
 However, three bodies were not found by the police, after which the police described the case as a case of honor killing
 ab dilli police ne maamla kholaa he or kaha he ki yah honor kiling nahin balki sochi samajhi sajeesh ke tahat hatya thi or is hatya ko anjaam abhishek, bawalaa urf sonu, ritesh samet kuch logon ne mil kar diya tha
 According to the police, Bavla has died in a road accident in this case, the other accused Sonu had committed suicide
 is baat kii jaanch police kar rahi he
 This whole incident has exposed the negligence of Uttar Pradesh Police
 aakhir upi police ne is maamle main kotahi kyon barti
 Was it not intentionally bestowed in this case, because in this case it is also clear that there was a phone conversation between the victim and one of the accused, then why did the police not try to find out

 On December 30, the government dismissed the complaint again on the advice of the Attorney General
 aise main general ke paas supreme court jane ke alaava or koi rasta nahin bachaa tha

 vaise atakalein yah bhi lagaai ja rahi hai ki vah ab apane pad se istipha de denge

 Sahara Group chief Subrata Roy is in trouble these days
 unke khilaaf supreme court kii taraf se gairajamaanti warrant jari ho chukaa he
 The journey of Sahara chief which started from Gorakhpur has now reached abroad via Lucknow, but in spite of all this, controversies are not giving up their pursuit
 niveshkon ke 24000 karod rupee kaa hisaab dene ke maamle main jabase court kaa danda sahaara par chalaa he tabhi se subrat roy ke paksh main khadi vakeelon kii fouj supremecourt ko kanoonee daanv pechon ke sahare gumraah kar rahi he
 Born on 10 June 1948 in Araria, Bihar, Subrata Roy's early education took place in Kolkata
 sudhir chandra roy or chhavi roy ke putr subrat roy ne upi ke gorakhpur ke ek sarkari college se maikenical ejineering kii padhai kii
 Subrata Roy started his first business from Gorakhpur
 subrat roy ne swapna roy se prem vivaah kiya he
 Those who know Subrata tell that he was weak in studies from the beginning
 unka man padhane se zyada anya baton main lagata tha
 The man, who started a business from a small town, spread his business across the world in 36 years
 subrat roy ne 1978 main jab sahaara kii shuruyaat kii thi tab unki jeb main mahaj 2000 rupee hi the
 People who have known Subrata since the 70s tell that Subrata Roy used to ride a scooter in Gorakhpur
 tab din main 100 rupee kamaane vaale log unke paas 20 rupee jamaa karte the
 Subrata Roy also has close to 100 friends working with him in his school, college
 agar dekha jaae to desh se lekar videshon tak sahaara samooh kii kai karod kii property faili hui he
 Apart from this, Subrata Roy has many properties in Lucknow, which is his work place
 lekin sabase zyada vivaadon main rahaa he sahaara state
 But, from time to time, Sahara Shree has been avoiding controversies, using his political reach
 sahaara ne lakhanu ke posh ilaake gomti nagar ke vipul khand or desh main vikhyath mayawati ke sapane ke taur par prachlit or dalit varg ke swabhimaan ke taur par sthapit ambedkar smarak ke bagal main maujuud 170 acre jameen ko yah kah kar alott karne kaa anurodh kiya ki vah is jameen par awasaiya, vyavsaayik or harith pattee viksit karegaa
 Actually, Sahara State in Gomtinagar was Subrata Roy's dream project but, Sahara resorted to manipulation to complete his dream project
 lekin, is sahaara shahar main rajaneta, abhinayta or bade bade players to ja sakate hai lekin lakhanu kaa aam aadmi nahin ghus saktaa he
 it when it became Sahara city , but when the responsible officials inspected it, they realized Subrata's fraud
 lekin tab tak der ho chuki thi
 The Municipal Corporation issued a show cause notice to Sahara but by then the corporation's negligence Subrata Roy had made Sanjeevani work for Sahara
 notice milane ke baad sahaara ne bhi der naa karte hue notice ke khilaaf court chale gaye
 Sahara did not stop here and filed arbitration in the Lucknow bench of the High Court
 yah maamla aaj bhi court main vichaaradhin he
 More than a decade has passed in this action, but Sahara is still occupied there as before
 sahaara ke kandhe par jab tak mulaayam kaa sahaara rahaa tab tak koi dikkat nahin hui lekin jaise hi 2007 main satta parivartan hua to mayawati kii nigahen subrat roy par tedi ho gai
 While taking action, the Municipal Corporation put a notice on the big doors of Sahara State and its big walls were also demolished but Sahara did not make any difference
 baharhaal, yah to rahi subrat roy sahaara ke vivaadon kii ek jhalak
 However, economic experts believe that if Sahara had to return the money to the investors, her condition would worsen
 kyonki team india se sponcership jane ke baad jahaan sahaara kii saakh par batta laga he vahiin ipel kii pune warirs kii frenchiji bhi nirast ho chuki he
 In such a case, a non-bailable warrant against Subrata Roy is working as fuel in the fire
 aisi shaayad hi koi mahila ho jise apane purush ke afaire par aapatti naa ho
 But a research has revealed that women are more sad than afflicted when they find out that their partner is connecting emotionally with another woman
 haal hi main kii gai is research ke mutabik agar pati kisi or mahila ke saath sex kare to mahilaayein dukhi to hoti hai, lekin pati kaa us mahila ke saath imotional hona patni ko bilkul bhi manjuur nahin he
 Two-thirds of the women involved in the research said that extra marital sex causes more trouble when husbands are emotionally attached to another woman
 lekin purushon ke saath aisa nahin he
 Only a third of the men surveyed admitted that the wife's June affair with a foreigner was not as painful as the emotional connect with her
 survey main shaamil paanch main se chaar mahilaon ne kaha ki unhen zyada jalan tab hoti he jab unka partner kisi or mahila se pyaar karne lagata he, bajaae iske ki vah uske saath alag-alag pojishan main sex kare
 At the same time, more than half of the men said that they feel angry about the idea that their partner is with other men
 america main karaae gaye is adhyayan main 477 vayaskon ko shaamil kiya gaya, jinase bhaavnaatmak or shaadishuda hote hue bhi kisi or ke saath sex karne jaise alag-alag paridrishyon main sawaal-jawaab kiye gaye
 According to the survey, most women said that it is more painful for the partner to be emotional with someone else
 jabaki iske thik ulat purushon ne kaha ki unhen apane partner ke sexual afaire se zyada takalif hoti he
 The wife's physical affair with a foreign man is the biggest betrayal for a man, but it is not so with women
 survey main shaamil har teesri mahila ne kaha ki agar unka partner apni purv premika ke saath sex karata he to takalif hoti he, lekin jab vah uske saath imotional hone lage to zyada dukh hota he

 ayodhya maamle main ( Ayodhya Case ) 18wein din kii sunwaayee ke dauraan muslim paksh kii taraf se varisht vakil rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki babari masjid main bhagwaan kii murti sthapit karnaa "chal se kiya hua hamalaa he
 "rajiv Dhawan said that the Hindu Mahasabha said that it would take the matter to the government, which means that the court does not have this jurisdiction, such shows should be banned" No More Rath Yatra "
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki hindu paksh kii daleel he ki muslim paksh ke paas vivaadit jameen ke kabze ke adhikaar nahin hai, na hi muslim paksh vahaan namaaj adaa karte hai
 The reason behind this is that the Nirmohi Arena in 1934 wrongly took illegal possession
 hamen namaaj padhane nahin di gai
 Hindus stopped Muslims from offering Namaz
 justise bobade ne poocha ki kya jab kisi muslim ne is baat kii shikaayat kii ki use namaaj nahin padhane di ja rahi he to us par koi karrwai hui thi? is par rajeev dhawan ne kaha masjid main murti kaa hona koi chamatkaar nahin balki sochaa samajha "hamalaa tha
 "he said, 'inside the arch are inscriptions of the word" Allah "
 dhawan ne puraani tasviren court main pesh kar daawa kiya ki vivaadit imaarat main madhya vaale mehrab ke upar arabi lipi main babar or allaah utkeern tha
 Apart from this, Kalma was also written
 uttari mehrab main bhi kellingraphy yani kalatmak likhaai main teen baar allaah likhaa tha
 Ram Ram was also written nearby
 justise bhushan or justise bobade ne poocha ki kya kisi khambhe kii tasviir bhi aap pesh karenge? dhawan ne is par koi saaf saaf jawaab nahin diya lekin kaha ki dashakon tak vahaan taala padaa rahaa
 Every Friday the lock kept opening and we continued to offer namaz, yet we are saying that it was not a mosque
 1947 main dilli main todi gai 30 masjidon ko PM nehru ne banane kaa aadesh diya
 On the other hand, there was a KK Nair of Faizabad DM, who was saying that there was a temple in Faizabad, which was demolished
 baad main nair kii photo imaarat main lagaai gai
 It is clear that he was discriminating in favor of Hindus
 ham kah sakate hai ki donon hi paksh vahaan upasna karte rahe
 But how can we say that there was no mosque there
 dhawan ne ek tasvirnuma nakshaa dikhaakar kaha ki 1480 gaj kaa bhure rang kaa hissaa devtaa or nirmohi akhaade ko diya he
 Part of the 740 square square was given to Muslim parties
 dhawan ne kaha ki hinduo kaa daawa he ki bich vaale gumbad ke neeche hi raamji kaa janm hua tha
 The Muslim side says how can you say that Rama was born there
 itnaa bada strecchar he, aap kaa daawa thos tathyon par aadhaarit nahin he
 Even if we assume for a while that the birth took place there, what is the point of making claims of parikrama? Advocate Rajiv Dhawan on behalf of Muslim parties said that Ramlala Ram was on the platform before the night of 22-23 December 1949
 chabutara janmasthan ke bahari ahaate main sthit tha
 This change of place is also contrary to the argument of Swayambhu
 bahari ahaate main ram chabutara, sita rasoi or bhandar the
 Those who had possession of the Nirmohi Akhara
 andar ramalala ke garbhagrih par hindu-muslim donon kaa
 But on the night of 22-23 December, the Sadhus of Nirmohi Akhara forcibly entered the mosque building and placed the idol of Ramlala
 isaki exiaar bhi he
 After the incident, the Akhara banned the entry of non-hindus there
 dhawan ne kaha ki ramalala ko naaballig bataate hue unke antarang sakha achaanak kabje kii aas main adaalat pahunch gaye
 Now according to the law established in the eyes of law, the idol of Ramlala may be recognized as a legal person, but he cannot sue
 nirmohi akhaada kii bhi is daleel se ham puri tarah sahamat hai
 The hearing will continue on Thursday

 Put this status on your whatsapp and Facebook on Hindi Day
 Earlier, many members including Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru appeared in favor of Hindustani (a mixture of Hindi and Urdu) language
 1937 main hi nehru ne apni raay rakhte hue kaha tha ki bharat bhar main aadhikarik rup se sampark sthapit karne ke liye ek bhashaa kaa hona jaruri he or hindustani se acha kya ho saktaa he
 At the same time, Gandhi also said that it would be better than English to make Hindustani the national language of India because it connects Hindus and Muslims, North and South
 lekin vibhaajan ne kai sadasyon ke man main itani chidh or gussa bhar diya ki hindustani kii maang peeche hoti chali gai orshuddh hindi(sanskritnishtha) ke pakshdhar baari padate nazar aae
 Here South Indian members were against both Hindustani and Hindi
 jab kabhi koi sadsy apni baat hindiya hindustani main bolta tha to koi dakshin bhartiya sadsy iske anuwaad kii maang karne lagata tha
 Hindi Diwas 2019: Happy Hindi Day with these messages: Historian Ramchandra Guha's book 'india After Gandhi' highlights this controversial topic
 ek sadsy aarvi dhulekar kaa zikr karte hue likhaa gaya he – jab dhulekar ne hindustani main apni baat kehani shuru kii to adhyaksh ne unhen tokate hue kaha ki sabha main maujuud kai logon ko hindinhin aati he or isliye vah unki baat samaj nahin paa rahe hai
 On this, Dhulekar stunned and said that those who do not know Hindustani do not have the right to live in this country
 ' udhar madras ke pratinidhitiv titi krishnaamchaaree ne badi hi safagoi se kaha ‘mujhe angreji pasand nahin kyonki isaki vajah se mujhe jabardastee shakespeare or milton ko siikhnaa padaa jinamein mujhe tanik bhi ruchi nahin thi
 Now if we will be forced to learn Hindi then it will be difficult for me to do this at this age
 saath hi is tarah kii ashishnutaa hamaare andar is baat kaa dar bhi paidaa kar degi ki ek majboot centre sarkaar kaa matlab un logon ko gulam bananaa bhi he jo centre kii bhashaa nahin bol sakate
 head
 
 
 main dakshin bharatiyon kii ore se yah chetavanee dena chaahunga ki pehle se hi dakshin bharat main aise tatv hai jo vahaan bantwaaraa chaahaten he, upar se mere upi ke dost ‘hindisamrajyavad' failaakar hamaari samasya ko badhaane kaa hi kaam karenge
 So my UP friends should decide whether they want 'akhand Bharat' or 'hindi-bharat'
 
 
 ' kadi bahes ke baad samvidhan sabha is samjhaute par pahunchi ki ‘bharat kii rajbhasha hindi(devanagari lipi) hogi lekin samvidhan lagu hone ke 15 saal tak yani 1965 tak sabhi sarkari kaamkaaj (adaalat or tamaam anya sevaayen) angreji main hi kiya jayega
 However, this decision, taken in the Constituent Assembly, brought another color after 15 years
 1963 main nehru ne rajbhasha adhinium ko disha dene kaa kaam kiya jiske tahat unhone is baat kii taraf ishaara kiya ki 1965 se aadhikarik rup se sabhi tarah kaa sanchaar hindi main kiya jayega or angreji ko ek sahaayak bhashaa ke rup main istemaal kiya ja ‘saktaa' he
 This sign of Nehru raised the ears of Hindi opponents
 unhen is 'saktaa' he main is shankaa kaa sanket mila ki ho saktaa he ki centre ke dwaara gaiyr hindibhashiyon par hindi'thopi' jaae, angreji kaa safaya ho jaae or yahi nahin hindiko rajbhasha ke saath saath rashtrabhasha kaa darja bhi de diya jaae
 On 26 January 1965, the then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri decided to declare Hindi as the official language, but before that the South Indian political party DMK declared a protest in Tamil Nadu against this decision
 madurai se lekar koimbatore or madras se lekar chote chote gaanv main hindiki kitabon ko jalaayaa gaya, yahaan tak ki kuch maamle aise bhi aae jisamen tamil bhashaa ke liye logon ne jaan tak de di
 After so much opposition, the Congress apparently seemed to soften its decision and Shastri made it clear on All India Radio in his message to the nation that English can be used as long as the public wants it
 saath hi unhone gaiyr hindibhashiyon ke dar ko dur karte hue aashwaasan diya ki har rajya yah khud tay kar saktaa he ki vah kis bhashaa main sarkari kaamkaaj yaa sanchaar karnaa chahta he, vah kshetreey bhashaa bhi ho sakati he yaa angreji bhi
 At the same time, English as well as English will be the language of functioning and communication at the central level
 itane kade virodh ke baad hindiko bharat kii rajbhasha kaa darja to mil gaya lekin 'rashtriya bhashaa' kaa darja milte milte rah gaya
 It is different that in many school books, Hindi is declared as the national language, which is factually incorrect because there is no national language of India
 bhartiya samvidhan main kisi ko bhi rashtriya bhashaa kaa darja praapt nahin he
 It has been made clear by the Department of Official Language that Hindi as well as English can also be used for functioning in Parliament and Center
 iske alaava rajyon ko vidhayika ke tahat apni bhashaa khud tay karne kaa adhikaar he jiske falswaroop bharat main22 bhashaonko aadhikarik darja mila hua he jisamen angreji or hindibhi shaamil he
 It has been made clear by the court on different occasions that all these languages have equal status and no language is more or less than any
 guha kii likhi kitaab main ek or dilachasp kissa he
 After this important announcement by Lal Bahadur Shastri on the radio once again when the matter came up in Parliament, Anglo Indian member Frank Anthony expressed concern over the 'intolerance' of the Hindi speakers of not accepting English
 iske jawaab main je bi kriplani ne mazaakia andaaj main kaha ki frank ko bharat main apni bhashaa (angreji) ke khatm hone kii chintaa nahin kerani chahie kyonki ‘ab to hamaare bachche bhi ammaa-appa nahin mummy papa bolne lage hai
 We even talk to our dogs in English
 ' apane pair jamaa chuki angreji par kriplani ne tanj kasate hue anthony ko ‘vishwaas' dilaayaa ki england se angreji gaayab ho sakati he lekin bharat se kabhi nahin

 Perhaps this is why the Sangh wants the BJP to keep its eyes open
 sanghane apane survey main paaya he ki jo sthiti maharashtra, haryana or jharkhand main thi waisi katai bihar, pashchim bengal or uttar pradesh main nahin rahane vaali he
 The alert voluntary National self-service Association has shown through a survey of its organizations that the ground conditions in Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh are not as good for the BJP as in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand
 sangh ne halaat ke hisaab se taiyaariyon par jor diya he
 Elections are going to be held in Bihar in the first of the three states
 bihar - 2015bihar main is saal ke aakhir main chunaav hone hai
 However, soon after the Delhi results, BJP President Amit Shah had told the workers to focus on Bihar and get ready
 haal ke dinon main shah bihar kaa daura bhi kar chuke hai
 Unlike other places, the BJP is not running the Ekla Chalo formula at present
 bihar main bijepi gathbandhan kii raah par chalane kii soch rahi he
 After Upendra Kushwaha and Ram Vilas Paswan, the BJP may also have an alliance with Jeetan Ram Manjhi in Bihar
 maanjhi kii dilli main bijepi ke aalaa netaaon se mulaakaat bhi ho chuki he
 Situations like Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand may not be there in Bihar but are completely different from Delhi
 dilli main koi sarkaar nahin thi, lekin bihar main nitish kumaar kii sarkaar he
 Nitish has again taken the key of power in the name of continuing good governance
 ab agar nitish kaa sushasan anti inkambency factor par baari padataa he to bijepi ke liye nishchit taur par raah mushkil bhari ho sakati he
 West Bengal - 2016: After Bihar, bjp's emphasis is on West Bengal where elections are to be held next year
 sharada chitfund ghotaale main trinmul congress ke kai netaaon kii giraftaar ke baavjood haal ke upachunaav main jeet mamata bannerjee ke liye badi uplabdhi maani ja rahi he
 In West Bengal too, if the BJP wants to take advantage of the anti-incumbency factor, it will also have to compete with the left parties in the race
 sangh ko ye baat samaj main pehle hi aa gai he isiilie wo bijepi ko aagaah kar rahaa he
 Uttar Pradesh - 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh will be held in 2017 but the Union is in favor of preparations from now
 sangh ke akalan ke hisaab se uttar pradesh main lok sabha jaisi sthiti to ab katai nahin he
 According to the Sangh, Mayawati's party BSP may be overshadowed by the BJP in UP
 kya sangh ko lag rahaa he ki modi lahar kii taasir kuch halki pad rahi he? sangh kii salaah maananaa bijepi kaa kartavya hi nahin philhal majaburi bhi he - or jarurat bhi
 Microblogging website Twitter will soon include the word 'subtweet' in its copyright
 khabaron ke mutabik, kisi shaks ke sandarbh main uske twitor handle kaa zikr kiye bagaiyr kiye gaye twit ko sabatwit kaha jayega
 The company has applied to buy the trademark of its word 'subtweet'
 agar twitor ko is shabd kaa copirite hasil hota he to 'sabatwit' kaa istemaal twitor apane vyavsaayik sandarbho main karegi
 On October 30, a few days after Jack Dorsike became the permanent CEO, he completed an application to get the trademark of the word Subtweet
 twitor ke pravaktaa ne bataaya ki company ne yah kadam yugers ke profile nem kaa durupyog rokane ke uddeshy se uthaaya he
 Words like tweet, subtweet and tweetstorm have been used for different activities on Twitter till now
 haalanki dilachasp baat yah he ki ye twitor ke aadhikarik shabd nahin hai, balki yugers ne khud inhen gadha he or yuj karte hai
 Significantly, Twitter tried to take the trademark of the word tweet
 par yah shabd twitor se pehle ap developers yuj karte the jisaki vajah se ise twitor ko nahin diya gaya
 In addition, Twitter has also started applying to obtain trademarks for words associated with its video-sharing social networking site Vine, which included 'vineers' and 'rewine'

 She is not ashamed to say that i love you
 apni behad vyast jindagi main bhi wo apni patni ko restraan le jaakar khaanaa khilaanaa nahin bhuulataa
 He is convinced not to keep the wife behind but to walk with him by holding his hand
 ji haa, ham baat kar rahe hai america raashtrapati baraak obama kii
 If we ask you how many times you have seen the US President without wife Michelle Obama, you might not remember
 obama duniya ke kisi bhi kone main hon, mishael hameshaa unke saath najar aati hai
 Both are identified as an ideal couple
 inhen america kii sabase romantic jodi ke taur par bhi dekha jaataa he
 The love between them is indeed an example
 khaastaur par un purushon ke liye jo apane vyast kaamkaaj kaa hawala dekar bivi-bacchon ko darkinar kar dete hai
 Think to yourself, will Barak have a shortage of work
 
 
 phir bhi wo apni patni ko bharpoor samay dete hai
 10 things that prove that Barak 1 is an excellent husband
 obama bhale hi duniya ke sabase taqatvar shaks kyon na hon lekin unhen apni patni se romance karnaa bhi bakhubi aata he
 During a television interview, Michelle herself confessed that her husband often sings songs only for her and she has a good voice
 2
 Mitchell said at the National Party of the Democratic Party that Barack knew to love selflessly
 wo pyaar ke liye tyaag karne main bhi peeche nahin hatate
 Material things do not matter to them
 3
 Mitchell had also said during this time that even though Barack may have reached the White House as President, he is still the same as he was 23 years ago
 mishael ne spasht shabdon main kaha tha ki wo vahi hai jisase unhone saalon pehle mohabbat kii thi
 4
 har patni chaahati he ki uskaa pati sirf or sirf uski khubsuurati kii tarif kare or use hi aakarshak kahe
 Barack Obama is exactly like this
 baraak maanate hai ki mishael behad aakarshak hai
 5
 pati, patni kii baat sunen isse acha kya ho saktaa he
 Barack Obama himself admitted in an interview that he quit smoking because of what his wife Michelle had said
 6
 Obama does not lag behind in expressing his love even on a public platform
 Ellen degeneres ke sho par unhone puri duniya ke saamne mishael ko ek behtareen mahila kaha tha or apane pyaar kaa izhaar kiya tha
 7
 soshal media or news portal par baraak obama or mishael kii jitani bhi tasviren aati hai, sabhi main donon ek-duusare kaa haath thame dikhte hai
 What else is this love? ek intervyuu main obama ne kaha bhi tha, mujhe ankhen mili hi isliye hai ki main tumhen dekh sakuun
 Barack has said many times that he always follows Michelle's advice and does not make any major decisions without asking Michelle
 america ke raashtrapati pad kii tamaam vyasttaaon ke bich ve mishael ke liye har din vakt nikaalte the or amuman subah kii eksrasij or brakefast ek saath hi karte the
 8
 agast 2012 main jahaan ek ore raajnneetik itihaas bana vahiin baraak or mishael kii ek tasviir ne bhi record tod die
 Barack and Michelle hug each other in this picture
 baraak apni har kamyaabi kaa shrey mishael ko dete hai or ye maanate hai ki wo unase kahin zyada kaabil hai
 To give so much respect to the wife is a sign of a good husband
 9
 a good husband is the one who can progress on his own but also help his partner to move forward
 uskaa saath de
 Michelle may be America's first woman but she also has an identity of her own and people know her for her views
 10
 This one thing proves how much Barak loves his wife
 bharat daure ke dauraan hawaizhaj se utarate samay baraak ne mishael kaa purse pakad rakhaa tha
 Some people may call it a slave of Joru, but for Barak, it was an opportunity to show love, which he did not let go

 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal returned halfway to the inauguration of a private school in Sangam Vihar area of delhi when he came to know that hundreds of people had gathered on the road and were protesting against the scarcity of water

 If there was no local police, the minister would have been beaten up with Satyendra Jain

 As the public surrounded the vehicles, the minister and the legislator were taken away on foot and from there the enclosure was taken by the police for the inauguration of the school under its protection

 Satyendra Jain arrived at 4 in the evening and left at around 7 pm to reduce the crowd of people gathered outside
 vahiin vidhayak prakaash jarwal ne bhaashan dete hue kaha ki mukhyamantri bhi aana chaahate the lekin vipakshi partiyon dwaara pryojit virodh pradarshan kii vajah se unhen aadhe raste se hi laut janaa padaa
 The education and thinking received in childhood stays with the child throughout his life
 aise main ye bahut jaruri ho jaataa he ki maa-baap apane bacchon ko behatar se behatar shiksha den taaki wo aage chalakar apane mulyon se bhataken nahin
 In such a situation, if you are the mother of a daughter, then it is very important for you to give such an education to your daughter, so that she does not panic in future and faces every difficulty
 ye puri tarah se aapaki jimmedaari he kiap apni beti ko uske aane vaale jivan ke liye kaise taiyaar karti hai
 But most of all it is important that you teach him to trust himself
 saath hi in jaruri baton ko bhi use aatmsaat karne main madad karen
 1
 usamen vishwaas jagaayen
 2
 uski soch kaa samarthan karen or use sahi raah dikhaaen
 3
 apni beti ko is kaabil banaaen ki wo apane pairon par khadi ho sake
 4
 use adarsh mahilaon kii kahaniyaan sunaakar prerit karne kii koshish karen
 5
 agar aapaki beti kuch acha kaam karti he to aap kisi keemat par uski tarif karnaa na bhoolen
 6
 apni beti ko sirf kaamyaab hona mat sikhie, uskaa ek acha insaan bananaa bhi bahut jaruri he
 7
 use samay-samay par sach bolne kii ahmiyat bataate rahiye

 Referring to Manmohan Singh's speech, he said that he was very sorry to hear such a speech and it is clear from this speech that even though the Central Government may trust the Panchayats, the State Governments have absolutely no confidence

 Jaitley joined the movement of Jayaprakash Narayan started in 1974
 apatkaal kii ghoshnaa ke baad unhen giraftaar kiya gaya kyonki ramlila maidan main jepi ke saath ve bhi maujuud the
 Jaitley, who started a political journey from rebellion, remained the party's loyalist till the end
 ek hi chunaav lade magar haar gaye
 Was a Member of Parliament in Rajya Sabha
 magar apni kaabiliyat ke bal par janata main hameshaa hi jan pratinidhi bane rahe
 He has never been seen as if the state has got the chair of all by the grace of someone
 jananetaa nahin to kya hua, rajaneta to the hi
 His style was full of decency, humility, bitterness, shrewdness and a different kind of gore
 magar kabhi apni baton kaa vazan halkaa nahin hone diya
 Was a spinner of statements
 unki baat kaati ja sakati thi lekin hoti khaas thi
 He used to present a challenge that you have preparation only then his words can be cut

 Were not tight-hearted

 When Narendra Modi was Chief Minister in Gujarat, Jaitley was his lawyer in Delhi
 pradhanmantri ne unke nidhan par gaharaa shok vyakt kiya he ki dashakon purana dost chalaa gaya he
 Arun Jaitley will also be remembered by Amit Shah
 ek acha vaqeel or wo bhi acha dost ho to safar aasaan hota he
 His style of looking and smiling was different
 kai baar chhedchhad vaali masti bhi thi or kai baar halak sukha dene vaala andaaz bhi
 Whoever was, used to do politics with his words and style, not with arrows and swords
 jo raajnneeti main rahata he vah janata ke bich rahata he
 Therefore his death should be seen as a public mourning
 saarvajanik jivan ko sinchate rahane kii prakriya bahut mushkil hoti he
 Those who carry it out should pay tribute to their demise

 Today will be a day of great sadness for the gracious and energetic leaders of BJP
