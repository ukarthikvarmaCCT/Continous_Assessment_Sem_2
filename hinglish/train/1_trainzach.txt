 Even before he was elected CM, he had said that if a girl wears decent looking clothes then no boy will see her wrongly
 yahi nahin, jab unase ladakiyon or ladakon kii aazaadee ke vikalp ke bare main poocha gaya to unhone kaha, 'agar aap aazaadee chaahate hai to phir nange kyon nahin ghoomte
 Freedom should be limited
 chote-chote kapadon par pashchim kaa prabhaav he
 In the tradition of our country, girls have been asked to dress modestly
 ' The Supreme Court has given great relief to the petitioners who have not deposited in the old bank note
 court ne yachikakartaon se kaha he ki vah apni is yachika ko us sanvaidhanik peeth ke paas le jaaen jo notebandi par sunwaayee kar rahi he
 These petitioners had filed a petition in the matter of non-deposit of old notes till 31 December 2016
 bataa den ki aane vaali 8 november ko notebandi ko ek saal puraa ho rahaa he
 The Attorney General has told the Supreme Court that no criminal action will be taken against these 14 petitioners
 aapako bataa den ki ye maamla pehle hisanvidhanpith ko bheja ja chukaa tha, lekin ye yachikaayen baad main daakhil kii gayi thim
 However, the RBI and the central government have clearly refused to give relief to those depositing old notes even after 31 March
 isse pehle 500-1000 ke puraane note badalane ko lekar daakhil ek yachika ko supreme court ne khaarij kar diya tha
 While rejecting the petition of the Overseas Citizen of India card holder, the court said that if in one case, people are ordered to change old notes, then the chaos will spread
 aise main puraane note badalane ke liye windo kholane ke liye nahin kaha ja saktaa
 What was the deadline? It is worth mentioning that at the time of announcement of demonetisation on 8 November 2016, the central government had fixed the deadline for depositing the banned currency in the bank till 30 December 2016
 jiske baad rigerv bank ne kaha tha ki puraani karency ko 31 march tak rigerv bank main jamaa kiya ja sakegaa
 However, he had conditioned the depositors in the Reserve Bank to explain the reason why the said currency was not deposited by the deadline of 30 December 2016

 Congress leader Modwadia said at an election rally, 'we cannot call Mr
 Modi a monkey
 kyonki vah praani nirdosh or bhagwaan ram kaa pakkaa anuyaayi tha
 If Modi calls himself a Ram bhakta, he should have reacted to the remarks of Ram Jethmalani who gave a statement about Lord Rama
 ‚Äôullekhneey he ki jethmalani ne isi maheene dilli main ek kaarykram main kaha tha, ‚Äòram ek kharaab pati the
 i do not like them at all
 kisi ne kuch kah diya to unhone sita ko van main bhej diya
 Modwadia had also raised controversy with one of his statements earlier when he compared Modi to the monkey in the context of the Ramayana
 baad main modwadia ne kaha ki unhen ummid he ki agle maheene hone vaale chunaavon ke pehle rakanpa ke saath siton kaa talmail ho jayega
 He said, 'discussion is going on in Delhi about the coordination of seats between Congress and NCP in Gujarat
 mujhe ummid he ki iskaa hal jaldi hi nikal aayega
 According to party sources, the Sharad Pawar-led NCP has claimed 11 seats, including six seats on which Congress candidates are more likely to win

 in / tri / ndmc_mcdportal / The Chief Minister of West Bengal travels on the front seat of a black-tinted Santro with a mirror
 'janata kii mukhyamantri' sabhi chauraahon par agal-bagal se guzarane vaale logon se baatcheet kar unhen khush kar detii hai or akasar log unhen gher lete hai
 After all, Mamta Banerjee likes to work with her style
 lekin jangalmahal main aisa dekhne ko nahin mila
 During the last two visits to Maoist-affected West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia districts, the Chief Minister of Bengal traveled in a bullet-proof Scorpio
 logon se sampark tuutane ke andeshe se banerjee suraksha badhaane ke prastaav ko sakhti se thukraa diya karti thim, lekin ilaake kii yatra ke dauraan unhone adhikariyon kii salaah maan lee
 Last week, the incident of Maoist leader Mallojula Koteshwar Rao alias Kishenji killed in an alleged fake encounter forced him to agree to take more comprehensive security
 nai sarkaar banane ke maatr chah maheene ke bheetar hi banerjee or unki party, trinmul congress vidrohiyon kii pehali dushman ban gai
 Ironically, Kishenji said before the last assembly election that he wanted to see Banerjee in the highest position
 maovadi or unka morcha, police atyaachaar virdohi jan samiti (pisiepie) ne makapa ke khilaaf matdaan karne ke liye jangalmahal main ek aadesh jari kar diya tha
 Due to this order, Banerjee got electoral success in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia districts
 lekin chunaav ke fouran baad donon ke bich mail-milaap khatm ho gaya
 However, Banerjee, with the help of rebels in Junglemahal, her loyal friends in Singur and Nandigram, was keenly engaged in building a political base by giving double inducement of development and employment to the local tribals
 duusari taraf , ugravadiyon ne trinmul ke kam-se-kam 28 daftaron ko jabaran band kara diya or uske aadha darjan sthaneey netaaon kii hatya kar di
 a Maoist leader said, "we hoped that Mamata would adopt a more flexible attitude and listen to our demands
" lekin aashcharya he ki ve makapa kii tarah pesh aa rahi hai
 He alleged that Banerjee had created a police rule in the area
 uskaa kahana he, ''police hamaari sabase badi dushman he
 He admitted that Kishenji's death was a major setback for the rebels and it would take some time for them to regroup
 phir bhi police koi khatra mol nahin lenaa chaahati
 "no one knows what will happen next," says Pravin Tripathi, Superintendent of Police, West Midnapore
 hamen kaaphi satark rahane kii jarurat he
 There is a truth in this that the Maoists have fled for some time but they will take revenge soon
 ''badla lene kii ashanka ke maddenjar banerjee kii suraksha kadi kar di gai he
 Apart from the officials of the State Intelligence Bureau, the National Security Guard (NSG) commandos and women policemen will now provide them a three-tier security cordon
 police kii report main kaha gaya he ki trinmul ke 11 netaa or mantri naksaliyon kii hit list main hai or mukhyamantri banerjee kaa naam sabase upar he
 One of the interlocutors appointed by Banerjee for peace talks with the rebels said, "it is possible that the Maoists are planning to avenge what they consider a betrayal by Mamata
" ve shanti kii baat karti hai lekin unka maovadiyon ke saath sangharsh kaa apana tarika he
 And there are some casualties from any side in the fight

 The by-election in 11 assembly seats of Uttar Pradesh, the contest between the SP, BSP, BJP and the Congress did not show enthusiasm in the by-elections on 11 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh on Monday
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki 11 siton par 46
 The turnout was 66 percent
 soobe kii 11 siton par upachunaav main sabase adhik ambedkarnar kii jalalpur seat par 59
 The turnout was 13 percent
 jabaki lakhanu kaint vidhansabha seat par sabase kam 28
 Voting was 53 percent
 lakhanu kaint ke alaava kanpur kii govindnagar or aligarh kii iglas seat par matadaata ghar se baahar nahin nikal sake
 The result is less than 33 percent voting in these three seats
 vidhansabha upachunaav main saharanpur jile kii gangoh, rampur, aligarh jile kii iglas surakshit, lakhanu kaint, kanpur nagar kii govind nagar, chitrakoot jile kii manikpur, pratapgarh, barabanki jile kii jaidpur surakshit, ambedkarnagar kii jalalpur, baharich kii balha surakshit or mau jile kii ghosi seat par somvaar ko voting hui
 a total of 109 candidates were in the fray in these 11 assembly seats
 lakhanu main behad kam matdaanalakhanau kaint seat par 28
 Voting was 53 percent, compared to 71 in the 2017 assembly election
 92 fisadi voting hui thi
 In this case, half of the voting has not taken place in comparison to 2017
 2017 main is seat par bijepi kii reeta bahuguna joshi ne jeet darj kii thi, lekin 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main saasand chune ke baad unhone vidhayak pad se istipha de diya tha
 Like Lucknow Cantt seat, there was no enthusiasm among voters in Kanpur's Gobovindnagar seat
 govindnagar seat par 32
 60 percent voting has taken place
 jabaki, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main is seat par 52
 Voting was 48 percent
 iske alaava aligarh kii iglas seat par 36
 There is 20 per cent voting, which is 64 in 2017 on the same seat
 88 fisadi matdaan hua tha
 It can be clearly understood that half of the voting was not even in the 2017 assembly elections
 ye rahaa voting pratishtjaidpur seat par 58
 5 percent, 44 in Pratapgarh Sadar seat
 55 fisadi, manikpur seat par 50

 43 fisadi,jalalpur seat par 59
 13 per cent, 41 on Rampur seat
 46 fisadi or gangoh seat par 60
 30 percent voting is done
 rampur or pratapgarh seat par 50 fisadi se kam voting rahi he
 Let me tell you that in the 2017 assembly elections, BJP won 8 out of these 11 seats and candidates of Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Apna Dal won one each
 ghosi ko chhodkar jin vidhansabha siton par upachunaav hua he ve un par chune gaye vidhayakon ke pichley loksabhaa chunaav main vijay hasil karne ke baad vidhansabha sadsyta se istipha dene kii vajah se khaali hui hai
 The seat is vacant due to his resignation after the election of Ghosi seat MLA Fagu Singh Chauhan as Governor of Bihar
 soobe kii jin 11 vidhansabha siton par upachunaav hue hai, inamen se 8 siton par 2017 main bijepi ne kabja jamaaya tha
 The sp-bsp-apna Dal has one seat each

 darasal bhavnagar se subah-subah khabar ai thi ki yahaan baraat lekar ja rahaa ek trek naale main ja gira jisaki vajah se 31 logon kii maut ho gai
 Many people were also injured in this incident
 istrakamein duulhe vijay ke maa-baap kii bhi maukey par hi maut ho gai
 When the procession was out in the morning, the groom got out in a separate car, due to which he first reached the wedding venue
 haalanki parivaar waalon ne yah faisla kiya ki duulhe ko is ghatana kii jaankaree nahin jaaegi or shaadi sampann karai jaaegi
 The groom was told that the truck was punctured, so the rest of the Baratis were delayed in reaching the spot
 duulhe se kaha gaya ki shaadi kaa muhoort biit rahaa he, isliye behatar hoga ki vah is kaarykram ko aage badaye
 Thus, the marriage was done
 shaadi kaa kaarykram sampann hone ke baad duulhe ko is puure ghatana kii jaankaree di gai
 But it was difficult for the groom to express the joy of marriage or to celebrate the grief of the parents' death
 jharkhand main mukhyamantri kii kursi ko lekar suspence badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Earlier, there were 3 contenders for the throne of the CM from the BJP, but now their number is 4
 agar jeemem ke prastaav par bijepi amal karti he to phir pehla naam he yashavanth sinha kaa
 He is a strong leader of the party and has held many important positions in the center in the past, but due to the absence of tribal sections, it is possible that his name cannot be agreed in the state
 inhen up mukhyamantri raghuvar das ke kheme se virodh kaa saamana bhi karnaa pad saktaa he
 Another big name is Arjun Munda
 arjuna munda pehle bhi jharkhand ke mukhyamantri rah chuke hai or adivasee tabake se taalluk bhi rakhte hai lekin khabar ye bhi he ki wo siem kii kursi ko dobaaraa paane ke liye zyada utsuk nahin he
 The third name from the BJP is the current Deputy Chief Minister of the state, Raghuvar Das
 raajnneeti kaa lanbaa anubhav he lekin gaiyr adivasee hone kii vajah se inke naam par sahmati bananaa aasaana nahin hoga
 The fourth and most shocking face may be that of Neelkanth Munda
 mana ja rahaa he ki bijepi duusare naamon par aam sahamit na ban paane kii sthiti main nilkanth munda kaa naam aage kar sakati he
 The tribals belong to the strata and are considered close to Kariya Munda but their distance from the central leadership of the BJP can go against them
 deepika padukon or ranvir singh ke bich kuch to chal rahaa he
 Recently both of them were seen in Mumbai's Olive Restaurant
 donon kabhi bhi ek duusare ko date karne kii baat ko nahin sweekaar karte hai
 ranveer-deepika came here to spend some good time, both wore denim and white T-shirt
 camera ko dekh deepika to isse bachati dikhin, lekin ranvir poj dene se khud ko nahin roak paae
 Ranveer was wearing a gray cap over the head, which he is wearing these days
 kai maukon par ranvir is topi ke saath najar aae hai, ho saktaa he ki yah unki film kaa nayaa luk he
 Ranveer and Deepika will be seen together again in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's next film 'bajirao Mastani'
 pahalu khan maamle main faisle ko lekar bahujan samaaj party (bispi) kii adhyaksh mayawati ko rajasthan kii congress sarkaar ke khilaaf twit karnaa mahangaa pad gaya
 6 mlas of Bahujan Samaj Party in Rajasthan on Friday rejected the talk of their party chief Mayawati by saying that she is sitting in Lucknow, she knows what is happening in Rajasthan
 bispi vidhayakon ne kaha ki rajasthan main congress sarkaar puri samvedansheeltaa ke saath pahalu khan ke maamle main aage badi he
 We are absolutely satisfied with this move of the government
 darasal, mayawati ne twit karke kaha tha ki congress sarkaar kii laaparvaahee kii vajah se pahalu khan ke aaropee chhot gaye hai
 If the government there was cautious in bringing justice to the victim's family, was it possible, perhaps never
 iske baad bahujan samaaj party ke rajasthan ke 6 vidhayak mukhyamantri karyaalay main siem ashok gahalot se milane pahunche or kareeb 3 ghante se zyada samay mukhyamantri karyaalay main bitaayaa
 After exiting the Chief Minister's office, the mlas said that Mayawati ji is not aware of the matter, hence tweeted against the Congress government
 sachai to yah he ki pahalu khan ke puure maamle kii jaanch bijepi sarkaar ke dauraan hui thi
 The Congress government is doing a good job in this matter
 bispi ke udaipurvati se vidhayak rajendra gudha ne kaha ki ham puri tarah se ashok gahalot ke saath hai
 The BSP MLA even said that there is no better Chief Minister in the entire country than Ashok Gehlot
 duusare vidhayak waajid ali ne bhi mayawati ke twit se khud ko alag kar liya
 At the same time, Name Singh Kheria said that Mayawati ji is not aware of the whole episode
 iske alaava nadbai ke vidhayak joginder singh awana ne bhi mayawati ke bayaan se khud ko alag kar liya
 The Gehlot government is supportive that Bahujan Samaj Party mlas in Rajasthan are supporting the Gehlot government in Rajasthan
 pichhali baar bhi ashok gahalot sarkaar ko purna bahumat nahin mila tha to bispi ke 6 vidhayakon ne samarthan diya tha lekin baad main sabhi chah vidhayak congress party main shaamil ho gaye the
 Let me tell you that a few days ago, party MLA Rajendra Gudha even accused Mayawati that she sells tickets with money, though at that time the remaining 5 mlas opposed it but today the other 5 mlas also Rajendra Gudha With Ashok standing in support of Gehlot
 gauratlab he ki rajasthan ke pahalu khan mob linching maamle main adaalat se sabhi aaropee bari ho gaye the
 The District Court of Alwar acquitted the accused on the basis of lack of evidence giving them the benefit of doubt
 congress kii madhya pradesh ikai ke adhyaksh kantilal bhuriya ne yogaguru swami ramdev ko 'bhoga guru' qaraar diya he
 He says that if Ramdev wants to do politics, he should openly do politics
 bhagava vastron kii aad lekar raajnneeti karnaa ek prapanch ke sivaay or kuch nahin he
 In a statement issued on Friday, Bhuria has questioned the discourses being given by Baba Ramdev with a view to benefit BJP governments and the party in forums in the name of yoga and religion
 bhuriya kaa kahana he ki rajgaddi se upar or shreshth hoti he vyas gaddi
 The language and conduct of the saints suits the saints, but when one is absorbed in saffron robes in dhana-lipsa, ashram-lipsa and Company nirman-lipsa, he is no longer a saint
 pradesh congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki bhartiya samvidhan bahudalon or bahuvicharon ke liye udaartaapurvak avasar uplabdh karaata he

 Samajwadi Party MLA Rajesh Shukla and BSP MLA Sanjeev Singh have advised the Kamal Nath government in the midst of the ongoing political upheaval in Karnataka
 inkaa kahana he ki sarkaar ke mantri, nirdaleey or samarthan dene vaale espi-bispi ke vidhayakon kaa bhi dhyaan rakhen
 Both SP MLA Rajesh Shukla and BSP MLA Sanjeev Singh were absent from the legislature party meeting held on Wednesday evening
 jabaki anya nirdaleey vidhayak or bispi vidhayak rambai baithak main shaamil hui thi
 Rajesh Shukla and Sanjeev Singh have alleged that the ministers of the Kamal Nath government neither pick up the phone nor allow time to meet properly
 bispi ke sanjeev singh bhind se vidhayak he to vahiin samaajawaadee party ke rajesh shukla bijawar se vidhayak hai
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, Samajwadi Party MLA Rajesh Shukla said, 'I did not even have information about the meeting
 mere paas naa massej aayaa naa phone
 It is natural that the Congress Legislature Party was meeting, so it was not considered appropriate
 sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se bilkul bhi santusht nahin hum
 Very angry with the ministers
 ham log kabhi phone karte hai to na unhen milane kaa time he or phone par bhi baat karne kaa time nahin he
 Today we are not in a position to say among the public what we have done in 7 months
 yahi naaraazgi he ki mantri koi kaam karnaa chaahate nahin
 He said, "all the work that the Chief Minister should take with him, whether small or big, he listens, but we are also ashamed of how many jobs the Chief Minister should tell us every day
" mantriyon kii bhi jimmedaari he ki unako bhi samarthak dalon ke vidhayakon ko dekhnaa chahie
 Even before this, questions were raised when we compromised that let's go to elections, a government was formed
 ek maheenaa, dedh maheene phir do-teen maheene aachaar samhita main nikal gaye to ham samjhauta karte rahe
 But after the Lok Sabha elections, the policy of transfers came
 aaj yah sthiti he ki transfar main vidhayak yadi ek prayaas karata he ki hamaare kshetra main esadm pahunch jaae to esadm nahin pahunch paa rahaa he
 The Tehsildar is also unable to reach
 transfar kii list to ham log bhi dekh rahe hai lekin kin ke kehane se ho rahe hai isaki jaankaree nahin he
 Rajesh Shukla said, 'we have not been able to carry out a single plan of development in 7 months
 siem kamalnath yogya or anbhavi aadmi hai
 He is taking us along
 lekin goa or karnataka ke baad sarkaar ko mantriyon par lagaam lagaakar rakhana chahie
 Otherwise, we are together, we will live together, neither should we move away from the Congress
 mantrimandal main jagah kii aashaa kam kar rahe hai
 We are satisfied in this that only development can happen in our region, our work continues
 'bispi vidhayak sanjeev singh ne bhi ajtak se baat karte hue kaha, 'siem kamalnath se koi naaraazgi nahin he
 But i would like to say one thing that the mlas who are supporting the government should be sensitive to the mlas
 kuch mantriyon kaa ravaiya thik nahin he
 Their functioning is also not good
 janata ne hamen bahut apeksha se or aashaa ke saath yahaan chunakar bheja he or agar ham unki ummiido par khara nahin utre to hamaare vidhayak rahane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 We will not be able to do justice to ourselves and the public
 mantrimandal main kis ko lenaa he yaa nahin lenaa he kis ko hataanaa he nahin hataanaa he yah mukhyamantri kaa visheshadhikaar he
 The Chief Minister should take a decision by reviewing the results which have come in the Lok Sabha elections
 jo nirdaleey vidhayak hai, samaajawaadee party ke hai yaa basapa ke hai un par bhi koi faisla unako lenaa chahie

 Many films have been released in theaters this Friday, one of which is 'dear Maya'
 is film ke saath saalon baad manisha koirala bade parde par vaapasi kar rahi hai
 The film is directed by Sunaina Bhatnagar and it is Sunaina's first film as a director
 film main manisha koirala ke alaava madiha imam or shreya choudhary bhi mukhya kirdaar main najar aa rahi hai
 Sunaina may be the director for the first time from this film, but she has previously assisted director Imtiaz Ali in many films
 'dear maaya' kahani he do doston kii jo shimla main rahati hai or vahiin ke ek skool main padhati hai
 Maya Devi lives in the neighborhood of these two girls, Anna and Ira, who never get out and live a colorless life
 ira or aina ko maaya kii is jindagi ke peeche kii sachai pataa chalati he to wo uski jindagi main rang bharna chaahate hai par maaya ke jivan main badlaav laane kii koshish main khud ira or aina kii duniya hill jaati he
 What happened to Maya's life and Ira and Anna's friendship? Will things that get damaged will be able to recover? To find the answers to these questions you have to turn to theaters

 lekin film kii pareshaani ye he kii darshak is film main maaya or in do doston ke kirdaar ke bich main bant jate hai
 Neither he is able to walk with the character of Maya nor live with these two friends

 film kii khoobiyon kii baat karen to is kahani kii jab parten khulne lagati hai tab aapako samaj aata he kii lekhak or nirdeshak ne kya kehane kii koshish kii he
 'deer Maya' is a depth film and viewers who like this type of cinema will like this film
 is film kaa kahani kaaphi acchhee he, lekin iske screen play ko thodaa kasne or focus karne kii jarurat thi
 Emotions of this film bind you most of the time and your eagerness remains intact till the end

 'dear Maya' is the story of two friends who live in Shimla and study in a school there
 inhen do ladakiyon, aina or ira ke pados main rahati he maaya devi, jo kabhi baahar nahin nikalati or ek berang jindagi ji rahi hai
 When Ira and Anna find out the truth behind Maya's life, they want to add color to her life, but in an attempt to bring change in Maya's life, the world of Ira and Anna themselves is shaken
 maaya kii is jindagi or ira or aina kii dosti kaa kya hua? kya jo chijen bigadi wo thik ho paaengi? is sawaalon ke jawaab dhundhane ke liye aapako theatres kaa rukh karnaa hoga
 But as always, this time too, by telling some shortcomings and some merits of this film, i can help you a little in making this decision
 tippaniyan It is a slow-paced film and it is not a film for the fans of fast paced and entertaining films
 is film kaa pehla hissaa mujhe thodaa khinchaa hua laga
 There are many beautiful moments in this part but the story moves slowly and you start getting restless in the chair
 'dear maaya' jindagi main khubsuurati, khushi or khud ko dhundhane kii baat karti he jahaan har kirdaar guzarate vakt ke saath khud ko talashta he
 But the problem of the film is that the audience gets divided between the character of Maya and these two friends in this film
 na to wo maaya ke kirdaar ke saath chal pate hai or na hi in donon doston ke saath rah pate hai
 You can't believe this story, but it only happens until the rest of the story opens and then slowly you get the idea of the story
 ye kuch chand khamiyaan hai jo mujhe is film main najar ain
 Talking about the merits of the film, when the layers of this story begin to open, then you understand what the writer and director have tried to say
 'dear maaya' ek gaharaai vaali film he or jo darshak is tarah kaa cinema pasand karte hai unhe ye film pasand aegi
 The story of this film is quite good, but its screen play needed a little tightening and focus
 is film ke imoshans zyaadaatar samay aapako baandh kar rakhte hai or aapaki utsukata ant tak barkaraar rahati he
 Apart from all this, the specialty of this film is Manisha Koirala who has done strong acting
 phir chaahe unka chaat khaane vaala seen ho yaa phir bahari jindagi se rubaru hone vaala drishy
 Manisha has done everything perfectly
 manisha ke saath saath madiha or shreya ne bhi jabardast abhinay kiya he, donon ke hi abhinay main tehraav he
 This is the first film of director Sunaina as a director and he showed that he has the qualities of a mature director
 imotionas ke filmakan par unki pakad he or diarection kii barikiyaan wo jaanati hai
 Seeing this first film of his, it seems that he just needs to clear his hands on his screen play
 film kaa sangeet or becoground score acha he or sangeet ke saath hi liriks bhi damdaar he
 3 stars from my side
 yah ek dhimi gati kii film he or tej gati or manoranjak filmon ke chaahane waalon ke liye ye film nahin he
 The first part of this film i felt a bit drawn
 is hisse main kai khubasurat pal hai lekin kahani dhire-dhire aage badhati he or aap kursi par baichaiyn hone lagate hai
 'dear Maya' speaks of beauty, happiness and finding oneself in life where each character discovers himself with the passing time
 lekin film kii pareshaani ye he kii darshak is film main maaya or in do doston ke kirdaar ke bich main bant jate hai
 Neither he is able to walk with the character of Maya nor live with these two friends
 is kahani par aap yakeen nahin kar pate, lekin ye sirf tab tak hota he jab tak kahani kii baaki parten nahin khulti or phir dhire dhire aapako kahani kaa falsafa samaj main aata he
 These are some of the few flaws that i saw in this film
 film kii khoobiyon kii baat karen to is kahani kii jab parten khulne lagati hai tab aapako samaj aata he kii lekhak or nirdeshak ne kya kehane kii koshish kii he
 'deer Maya' is a depth film and viewers who like this type of cinema will like this film
 is film kaa kahani kaaphi acchhee he, lekin iske screen play ko thodaa kasne or focus karne kii jarurat thi
 Emotions of this film bind you most of the time and your eagerness remains intact till the end
 in sabake alaava is film kii khaasiyat hai manisha koirala jinhone damdaar abhinay kiya he
 Whether it is a lick-eating scene or a scene about an external life
 manisha ne har bhav ko bakhubi anjaam diya he
 Along with Manisha, Madiha and Shreya have also done tremendous work, both of which have stagnated in acting
 nirdeshak sunaina kii bataur nirdeshak ye pehali film he or unhone dikhaa diya kii unke andar ek paripakv nirdeshak ke gun hai

 For example, if a fighter pilot is injured, he is given a ground job

 The court said that if he had suppressed everything related to his gender disorder, he could have proved to be the most dangerous man in the Navy
 behatar hua ki usne ye oparation kara liya
 It is noteworthy that Manish was posted as a cellar by the Navy before changing the gender, but he was fired from the job after changing the gender

 jammu kashmir main bijepi ne sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene ke liye pidipi ko jimmedaar tehraaya

 The ninth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) may have started well, but the glow of this league, one of the most successful sporting events in the world, seems to be fading
 cricket se jude spot phixing ke vivaadon kaa ipel kii lokapriyata par kaaphi had tak nakaaratmak prabhaav padaa he
 Former head of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2013 in the sixth edition of the IPL
 shrinivasana se match phixing se jude vivaad ke kaaran do tiimon chennai super kings or rajasthan royles par do saal ke liye pratibandh lagaaya gaya tha
 The fixing had an impact on the IPL
 However, the BCCI has tried to fill this gap by including two new teams in the IPL - Rising Pune Supergiants, Gujarat Lions, in the ninth edition, but there is a perception that match fixing in this game on a big scale
 And its popularity has declined due to corruption disputes
 match phixing or bhrashtachar vivaadon ke kaaran shrinivasana ko bisisiai ke adhyaksh pad se haath dhonaa padaa tha or yah maamla ritred justise aar
 M

 Thereafter, the Lodha committee presented several suggestions and if implemented, perhaps the game could have changed widely in India, but the BCCI and other organizations are against the committee's many suggestions

 The reduction in IPL viewership and the number of people attending stadiums during matches is not new

 According to the 2014 annual report of the IPL, 1,000 crore in its earnings (1

 IPL has been a subject of controversies Apart from everyone, IPL 2016 has also been in the news due to many problems

 After nearly 60 years of service in the Indian Navy, the aircraft carrier Virat has left for its last operational mission

 The President and the Prime Minister will be involved in this international review to be held in Visakhapatnam
 iske jariye hind mahasaagar main nausena duniya ko apni takat dikhaaegi
 After this, Virat will not participate in any operational action and then it is likely that it will be retired by the end of this year or next year
 dhyaan rahen duniya main kisi bhi vimanavahak pot ne itani lambii seva nahin di he
 Virat was inducted into the Navy on 12 May 1987
 isse pehle viraat britrain kii royal navy main echemes harmis ke naam se tha jahaan isane argentina ke khilaaf fockland yuddh main hissaa liya tha
 The ship first served the British Navy for 30 years before being brought to India

 com / k8pagp8wly Using social media from a smartphone you put a post to boycott Chinese goods
 isliye, kyonki china pakistan kii taraf he or pakistan bharat main aatanki hamale kara rahaa he
 But is it possible? Start with yourself and see where the smartphone, tab or laptop you are posting through the boycott of China has been created
 zyada ummid he ki wo china kaa hi bana hoga
 Even if it is not from China, then some products made in it will definitely be made in China
 appal, motorola or samsung ke products bhi 'chinis' hi hambharat main shaomi jaisi darjanon companiyaan bad chadh kar gagetts bech rahi hai
 Due to the quality being cheap, it has become a necessity for people to buy it
 ek baar ko aap inhen chhod den, lekin kya aap is tathy se munh mode lenge ki amerity tech diggaj appal ke yphone bhi china main assembl hote hai jinhen shaan se ham yuj karte hai
 If Apple, HP, Samsung, Lenovo and Motorola are using smartphones or laptops and campaigning to boycott Chinese goods on Facebook, it would not have been digested
 kyonki in sari companiyon ke zyaadaatar divaais china main hi banate hai
 Indian companies are still failing! Talking about India, most of the gadgets which are sent to India are made by China
 mid range ke bazaar main chini handset bhare pade hai or inhen abhi tak bhartiya companiyon ne riples nahin kiya he
 If you ignore these products then what will you do? Indian smartphone companies have so far failed to make the kind of devices through which the general public can depend on them
 maid in india divaais ke parts kahaan se aate hai?laptop, computer, smartphone, tablet, smart watch se lekar divaais main lagaae jane vaale chip tak china banate hai
 Once you can use a smartphone from an Indian company and say that we are using indigenous goods
 lekin kya us smartphone main lage sabhi parts bhi bharat main bane hai? ek smartphone yaa laptop main kai parts hote hai jise alag alag companiyaan alag alag deshon main banaati hai
 So is the device actually made by Indian companies indigenous? Now you decide this yourself
 kya internet or fasebuk bhi yuj karnaa band kar denge?ab aate hai internet par
 The Internet means Google and Facebook for most people
 ye to pataa hoga ki ye donon companiyaan america hai
 But are the stock holders and investors of these companies also only American
 inase china ke alaava bhi kai desh paisa kamaate hai
 So will you stop using Google, Facebook and Twitter now? Will you use mobile apps too? Smartphones have operating systems and many apps
 chating ap, shopping ap, tuls or travel ap
 We Chat is a chatting app which is also very popular, it is also made from China
 iske alaava kai mashhoor ap main china ne nivesh kar rakhaa to kya ab bhartiya janata ap bhi na yuj kare?britain kaa bhi yahi haal he
 Most of the goods sold not only in India but also in Britain are made in China
 2012 main landan olympic ke dauraan aadhikarik website par beche gaye 90 fisadi se zyada products china ke bane hue the
 P
 S-fasebuk aapke rosemara kii jindagi kaa ahm hissaa he
 Many Facebook products you use
 iske maalik or siio mark jakarberg hai or unki patni preshila chaiyn bhi china kii hi hai
 If you want to boycott Chinese products, then this can also be a reason for you
 ulhasanagar, pune or nasik sahit maharashtra ke vibhinn shaharon ke logon ne taaja nagar nikaay chunaavon ke baad jo mahasoos kiya he, vaisaa hi kuch ehsaas, 13 march ko uttar pradesh yaa uttarakhand main logon ko hoga
 Elections now bring a kind of forethought
 paanch saal baad log apane numaayinde badalanaa chaahate hai lekin chaalaak numaayinde apni partiyaan badal kar phir chidhaane aa jate hai
 From Nashik to Uttarkashi and Goa to Gorakhpur, democracy has become a mess
 pratinidhitiv aadhaarit lokshahi sir ke bal khadi he
 More than half of bjp's councilors were imported from Congress, NCP, Shiv Sena in Pune municipal election
 nasik main puri kii puri manase bhaajapa main samaa gai or bhaajapa jeet gai
 In Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, many representatives of BSP, SP, Congress and RLD are present in the election field by sticking labels of other parties on the forehead
 duniya ke kisi bade bahudaleey loktantr main is kadar dalbadal nahin hota, jitna ki bharat main he
 Elections in India are held throughout the year
 yahi ek kaam he jise rajnatik dal puri gambhirtha ke saath karte hai, gavarnence to bache hue samay kaa istemaal he
 When the results of the civic elections were coming to Mumbai, the list of candidates for the civic elections was being released in Delhi
 uttar pradesh main vot karte hue log odisha main panchayat chunaavon ke nattejey dekh rahe the
 The stakes of small elections have become so big that in the promotion of panchayat elections in Odisha, the BJP fielded the Chief Ministers of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand while the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) brought in film stars
 sanad rahe ki panchayat chunaavon ke bade hisse main pratyaksh rup se daleey raajnneeti kaa dakhal nahin hota
 If elections are the biggest annual project of democracy, then at least they should be corrected
 isi main sabakaa bhala he
 Black money, domination of the strong, purchase of votes is the outer road of elections, the inner is deeper than this
 rajnatik dal or chune hue pratinidhi (pratyaashee), sansadeey loktantr kii buniyadi sansthaaen hai
 Together, the two have put the elections in a condition where there is no blessed feeling like the Mahaparva of democracy
 pratyaashee pehle sudharen yaa rajnatik dal? bahes, pehle murgi yaa anda jaisi he
 This is perhaps the worst phase of representation-based democracy
 raajnneeti main apradheekaran ko khatm karne ke pradhanmantri ke 2014 ke chunavi vaade kaa to pataa nahin ulate ab dalbadal kanoon nidhaal padaa he
 The habit of changing parties spread from elections to governments
 arunachal or uttarakhand ko giniye yaa phir maharashtra ke nikaay chunaavon se lekar taaja vidhansabha chunaavon tak dalbadaluon kaa hisaab lagaaie, chunaav jeetne or satta main bane rahane ke liye kuch bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 If the choice becomes a compulsion to vote only then the voting purpose will end
 chunaav va sansad yaa vidhansabhaayen nahin balki rajnatik dal loktantr kii buniyadi sanstha hai jo lokshahi kii bimariyon kaa kaarkaana hai
 Political parties do not have the same rules as a small partnership firm
 kharaab pratyaashee, dalbadal, aloktantric dharre or chande tak lagbhag sabhi dhatakaram siyaasi dalon se nikalakar vyapak loktantr main failte hai
 It is difficult to separate governance from political parties, because the blue print of government policies is formed in the political factory of the party that rules, due to this rift in the foundation of democracy, politics has become its own business model in which winning the first way or the other is a necessity
 is
 siyaasi vanshavaad sansad se panchayaton tak pasar gaya he
 New political families have emerged in every state, which is not difficult to identify
 uttar pradesh main 50 se adhik siyaasi kunbe is chunaav main khulkar sakriy hue
 Smaller clans have occupied lower level elections
 jeet kii guarantee ke liye ye parivaar har chunaav main badi sahajata se dalon ke bich awajahi karte hai or achche pratyaashiyon kaa vichaar ubharne se pehle hi mar jaataa he
 Interestingly, two proposals are under discussion from the perspective of elections - one for the root of democracy and the other for the summit
 pehla, daleey raajnneeti ko pratyaksh rup se panchayaton chunaav tak lagu kar diya jaae
 Second, the elections to the parliament-assembly should be held simultaneously
 kya in donon se pehle yah jaruri nahin he ki loktantr kii buniyadi sanstha yani vibhinn rajnatik dalon ko thik kiya jaae?aakhir kab tak ham loktantr ke prati daayitv kii kasam khaakar unhen vot daalate rahenge jo loktantr ko sadaane ke nae kirtiman bananaa chaahate hai? 10 days after the terrorist attack on the army camp in Uri, the Indian Army has entered the house and shown Pakistan a trailer of terror
 10 dinon ke dauraan saikadon ghanton tak band kamare main baithak kar badmijaaj pakistan ko uski aukaat dikhaane ke liye 28-29 sitambar kii darmyaani raat chuni
 In this four-hour trailer, India told that if Pakistan still does not desist from its antics, then the days ahead will be heavy for it
 bhartiya sena ne kal raat pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir (pioke) main ghuskar aatankiyon ke launch padtabah kar die
 Commandos of Special Forces destroyed 8 camps of terrorists while carrying out surgical strikes
 kareeb 4 ghante chale is oparation main 38 aatanki maare gaye
 Two Pakistani soldiers were also killed in the process of saving the terrorists
 taaja ghatana se bharat aurapakistanke bich tanaav or bad gaya he
 a round of accusations has started from both sides
 pakistan ke khilaaf karrwai ko lekar sarkaar or sena ko badhaaiyaan mil rahi hai to pakistan kii fouj isse inkaar kar rahi he ki bhartiya sena ne uski jameen par sargical strike ko anjaam diya he
 After the terrorist attack in Uri on September 18, the pressure on the Modi government to take action against Pakistan was increasing
 piem modi ne har morche par pakistan ko gherne kii koshish kii
 When External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj showed Pakistan a mirror on the terrorism front from the UN platform, PM Modi refused to go to Pakistan for the SAARC conference and isolated himself on the stage of South Asian countries
 is dauraan piem modi or unke sipahasalarpakistanper nishaanaa sadhate rahe
 While Modi targeted Pakistan's ruling militants who threatened a nuclear attack on the neighboring country, the BJP president Amit Shah showed a strong attitude against the war against Pakistan
 bharat ne sindhu nadi samjhauta todane or pakistan se menen kaa darja waapas lene kii chetavanee dekar padosi mulk ko gherne kii koshish kii
 After the Uri attack, a media group claimed that Indian commandos entered pok on the night of 20-21 September and destroyed 3 camps of terrorists
 is dauraan 20aatankiyon ke maare janeka daawa bhi kiya gaya
 But it was not confirmed by the army
 tab se lekar abtak sena kii kisi halchal ke bare main media main khabar nahin aa rahi thi
 He met the chiefs of the three armies in New Delhi a day before PM Modi attacked Pakistan with terrorism, poverty, illiteracy and unemployment at the BJP national executive in Kerala
 ummid thi ki wo pakistan ko munhtod jawaab die jane ke masale par kuch sakht lahaze main bolenge lekin aisa nahin hua
 On Thursday, when DGMO Ranbir Singh made public the information about the surgical strike, the people of the country came to know that the army has attacked in the land of Pakistan
 uri hamale ke 10 din baad bhartiya sena kii javaabi karrwai par desh main jashn he to shaheedon ke parijanon ne bhi khushi jaahir kii he
 But now the question is arising whether the Indian government has avenged the Uri attack
 sarkaar or sena kii ore se kii gai ab tak kii karrwai padosi mulk ko sabak sikhaane ke liye paryaapt he?bharat ko abhi pakistan main khuleam gum rahe aatank ke aakaaon ke khilaaf karrwai karnaa baaki he
 lashkar-e-taiba chief Hafiz Saeed and jaish-e-muhammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar continue to spew venom against India the day they arrive
 sarhad se sate pakistani sena kii un chaukiyon kii pahchaan kar unhen tabah karnaa bhi jaruri he jahaan se bharat ke khilaaf aatanki launch kiye jate hai

 *** In his meeting with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, the veteran BJP leader LK Advani made it clear that he did not have the leadership of Modi
 bhagwat or adwani ke bich sangh mukhyalay main guuruuvaar ko baithak hui
 According to sources, Advani told the Sangh that the NDA should fight under a collective leadership in the 2014 elections
 kisi ek shaks kaa naam aage karne se na sirf party sanghathan, balki saajhedaaron main bhi galat sandesh ja rahaa he
 It is worth mentioning that Advani has been vocal about collective leadership in the past, but after the defeat of the Sangh, the party leaders ignored him and announced Narendra Modi as the Chairman of the Election Campaign Committee
 agar adwani or bhagwat kii 75 minute lambii mulaakaat kii baat karen, to isamen sangh ke logon kii karypranali par bhi sawaal uthaae gaye
 He mentioned Suresh Soni of the Sangh and Ram Lal of the Sangh working as general secretary in the BJP
 adwani or unke kheme ke kai netaaon ko shikaayat he ki sabhi mahatvapurn faisle yahi kotary karti he
 In such a situation, it is being said that Bhagwat may possibly bring these two back to the Sangh after a few months and deploy a non-political figure like Dattatreya Hosabale to BJP
 gauratlab he ki goa main suresh soni maujuud the or unheen kii dekharekh main adwani kii gairmaujuudagi ko nazarandaaj kar modi ke naam ke elaan kaa oparation sanchalit hua
 The most angry Advani resigned from the party's three important posts on 10 June
 kai aalaa netaaon ne unhen manaaya magar ve naaraaz bane rahe
 Then Mohan Bhagwat phoned him and asked him to withdraw his resignation
 adwani ko aashwaasan diya gaya ki unki shikayaton par gaur kiya jayega
 This meeting was held under the same
 pehle yah buudhvaar ko prastaavit thi, lekin adwani ke kharaab swasthya ke chalate ise ek din aage khiskaana padaa
 Advani's Modi opposition seemed to be decreasing in the recent past
 modi planning kamisha kii meeting ke liye dilli aae to adwani se bhi mili
 There were reports that Advani was more annoyed by the Sangh's interference than Modi's announcement
 magar maajaraa phir badal gaya
 His lieutenant Sudhriand Kulkarni called Modi a dictator
 party adhyaksh rajnath ko lomadee si niyat vaala bataaya
 On the other hand, JDU also slammed Modi and BJP for withdrawing support, citing Advani
 or in sabake bich party main apni khoi haisiyat paane ke liye adwani usee sangh ke paas pahunche, jiske sanghathan main jarurat se zyada hastkshep ke khilaaf unhone morcha khol rakhaa tha

 Also, it is not hidden from anyone that this area is a malnutrition belt
 is vajah se mauton kaa aankada itnaa zyada he
 At the same time, without increasing the resources, such cases are also coming due to the government's plan to deliver in the hospital 
 mgm astapatal ke adheekshak dow vibhishana ne bataaya ki bacchon kii maut undervet or primechayor delivery kii vajah se hui he
 The hospital administration is doing its best to save the children
 haalanki 900 gram jaise kam vajan ke baccho kii cervival rate kam hone kii vajah se itane maamle bade hai
 At the same time, the number of deaths has increased due to increasing number of patients

 Jharkhand is struggling with malnutrition, many deaths have also arisen due to these deaths within just one month
 isse pehle bhi ek aankada aayaa tha, jisamen 177 dinon main 164 bacchon kii maut hui thi
 According to a 2015-16 report of the National Family Health Survey-4, 47 in Jharkhand for 5 years
 8 fisadi bachche kuposhit hai
 The condition of other hospitals is also very bad for other government hospitals in Jharkhand

 1350 rupees were asked from the family for investigation, if the family had only 1300 rupees, they refused to investigate
 isi bich maa kii god main hi bachche kii maut ho gai
 State Health Minister Ramchandra Chandravanshi had said in this case that the media is unnecessarily blaming it
 agar itnaa hi dukh he to sabhi patrakaron ne das rupee chande dekar ilaaj kyon nahin karavaaya
 Despite coming from BPL segment, no benefit is being given to the patients, whereas in RIMS, many types of investigations are free for poor patients

 (from input language) loksabhaa chunaav ke vakt voter banane kii kavayad desh bhar main bade paimaane par hui
 Names of several lakh new voters were added to it and they also used their votes
 ab chunaav ke baad ellection kamishan voter list ko durust karne kii nai muhim main jute gaya he
 For this, a software is being used, through which the information of duplicate voters is coming out
 is list ko chunaav ayog sambandhit jilon main bhejkar uskaa satyaapan kara rahaa he
 In this episode, after the 80% verification in the Parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, about 23,664 duplicate names have been found, which will be removed from the voter list
 varanasi ke sahaayak jila nirvachan adhikari ne duplikeshan list ke jariye hamen ye samajhane kii koshish kii ki in dinon chunaav ayog voter list ko durust karne kii koun si karrwai kar rahaa he
 This entire action is related to sorting out the duplicate voters, in which the verification of how many voters are there is named in two places
 varanasi ke jiladhikari pranjal yadav ne bataaya ki ellection kamishan of india dwaara desh bhar ke jilon main duplikeshan eksrasij ko check karne kii muhim jari he
 In many places, two names are entered in the electoral list, in one district, the names are already there and in other places, they are being exercised to remove them
 varanasi ke pindra, ajgara, rohaniya, sewapuri, shivpur, varanasi uttari, varanasi dakshini, varanasi cant ke kul aath vidhansabha kshetron main bielo ke jariye aisi liston kaa satyaapan karaayaa ja rahaa he
 For this verification, the Election Commission has prepared a new software, through which a long list of duplicate voters was sent to these assembly constituencies of Varanasi district in lakhs
 is list kaa ab tak 80 fisadi satyaapan karaayaa ja chukaa he, jisamen 23,664 matadaata dupliket paae gaye
 Varanasi DM Pranjal Yadav said that the Election Commission of India does something every year to improve the electoral role
 ek nayaa software dizin hua he, jiske jariye dupliket voter is tarah aaidentifi hokar har jile main aae hai
 23,600 names have been found in Varanasi, which no longer live here
 unke naam ham hataa denge, to hamaara elactoral role or impruve ho jayega
 It is worth noting that whenever there is a campaign to make voters, people who have come from one district to another on a large scale take their names in the voter list, but do not get their names changed from the voter list of their original place, due to which a large number of duplicate voters remain
 inhen votaron ko chinhit karne kii yah kavayad he, lekin nayaa software aise sabhi naamon ko chinhit kar legaa, yah kahana bada mushkil he, kyonki ek naam ke kai vyakti ho sakate hai
 In such a situation, the computer will be caught by the name of their father or husband, but in a list, the father's full name is written and in a list there is a short form, then the computer can hardly catch this difference, yet it is worthwhile to correct the voter list

 The result of the assembly elections of 5 states has come in the country
 in 5 rajyon main bijepi sabase bade dal ke rup main ubhar kar saamne ai he
 The party has found a clear mandate to form an absolute majority government in important states like Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand
 vahiin manipur main bijepi ne na sirf khaataa kholaa balki sabase bade or prabhavi dal ke rup main apni jagah banaai he
 The BJP has made it clear from the results of these 5 states that no political party has the power to remove it from power in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections - because the Modi wave in 2014, the storm in 2017 and tsunami in 2019 Going to be 2014 kii lahar banegi 2019 kii tsunamiuttar pradesh main loksabhaa kii 80 seat, punjab main 13, uttarakhand main 5, goa or manipur main 2-2 seat hai
 102 seats in total
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main in rajyon main bijepi ko kul 80 seat par jeet darj hui thi
 It had a strong hold in Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa but the figures were weak
 manipur main bijepi thi nahin or sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh main vah dononsmaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj partise kamjor thi
 In the 2017 state assembly elections of these 5 states, bjp's position in 4 states has strengthened since 2014
 In a nutshell there is no leader today with a pan India acceptability who can take on Modi & the BJP in 2019
 - Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) March 11, 2017 Dwarfed This big threat of 2019 is the only example of stopping the Modi wave after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in Delhi Assembly elections by Aam Aadmi Party
 arvind kejariwal ne bijepi kaa virodh karte hue dilli vidhansabha par kabja kar kendra sarkaar main baithi bijepi kii naak ke bal ko khinch liya tha
 Now in the 2017 elections, the Aam Aadmi Party could not show its influence in Goa and Punjab
 vahiin uttar pradesh or uttarakhand jaise bade rajya main aap ne pehle hi ghutane tech die the
 Obviously, these results have also made it clear that the Aam Aadmi Party is no longer a significant challenge for the BJP in the 2019 elections
 2019: modi ke takkar main koi nahinuttar pradesh main lambey arse ke baad bijepi ne vaapasi kii he
 Earlier in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party won 71 seats and surprised the important Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in the state
 us vakt donon partiyon ne ise kendra kii sarkaar kaa mandet qaraar diya tha
 But now in 2017, the BJP has returned with an absolute majority government
 isse saaf he ki rajya ke votaron ne kshetreey dalon ko nakaar diya he
 The voters of the state have made it clear that their choice is one for the politics of the Center and the State
 fail hua rahul-akhilesh kaa bada daanwalihaaja saaf taur par kaha ja saktaa he ki 2019 main aane vaali modi kii tsunami ko takkar dene ke liye is rajya main koi netaa nahin bachaa he
 At the same time, Uttar Pradesh's importance also becomes important because here Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Congress Yuvraj Rahul Gandhi tried political engineering keeping in mind the 2019 elections
 vahiin, is koshish ke chalate yadi akhilesh yadav ek baar phir 2017 main chunaav jeetne main safal ho jate to bijepi ke liye 2014 kii jeet kii punrariti karnaa mushkil ho jaataa
 The Congress's incomplete victory in Punjab has overthrew the Shiromani Akali dal-bjp alliance
 lekin yah is baat kaa sanket nahin he ki rajya main congress majboot hui he
 Congress has emerged as the largest party in the state
 lekin is jeet ke liye congress party ko jimmedaar nahin tehraana chahie
 Captain Amarinder's hold is more important in this victory
 vahiin akali ke khilaaf anti inkambency ko saadhane main bijepi or aap kii vifaltaa bhi congress kii jeet ke liye kaaphi had tak jimmedaar he
 So, even if the results of Punjab make the Congress happy, this happiness will not last long
