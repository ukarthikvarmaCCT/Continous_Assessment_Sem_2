 syria or iraq jaise mulkon menaiieski badaulat fidaayin hamalaavaron or yahaan tak maasoom maanav bamon kii bhi koi kami nahin
 But this is the first time in recent times when the police in Iraq have managed to control an innocent human bomb, which came to kill innocent people by tying gunpowder on their bodies at the behest of terrorists
 jaaniye aakhir kaise mumkin hua ye or kaise pakadaa gaya jinda or maasoom maanav bam?bachche ke pet main bandhi he barood se bhari beltisbache capet main bandhi ye safed rang pattee yani barood se bhari belt
 Actually, this belt is the only thing of death that can blow not only this child, but all the people around it in a jolt
 kyonki ye maasoom koi maamuli baccha nahin, balki iesas kaa wo maanav bam he, jise duniya ke is sabase badnaam aatankwaadi sanghathan ne kuch isi tarah taiyaar kar begunaahon kii jaan lene ke liye kirkuk shahar ke bich chhod diya tha
 But before he could succeed in his intentions, the policemen became suspicious of its antics and were caught before detonating or bursting the bomb
 bam diphyus karnaa sabase badi chunauteeb chunki maamla apane-aap main behad sangeen tha, pulisavaalon ne sabase pehle bachche ke donon haath kas kar pakad liye, taaki wo kisi bhi keemat par apane jism main laga wo switch naa dabaa sake, jisase barood se bhare is belt main dhamaakaa ho or tabaahi mache
 But this operation could not be completed just by taking control of this child
 balki abhi pulisavaalon ke saamne is bam ko bachche ke jism se alag kar use diphyus karne kii badi chunauti thi
 Because it has often been seen in the case of suicide bombers or human bombs, when the handcuffs of remotely held human bombs, before the human bombs themselves, blow such terrorists out of their hands
 maamuli si galati kaa matlab mautlihaaja maukey kii najaakat ko dekhte hue fouran iraqi fouj ke bam dyspojal skhwaid ko maukey par bulaayaa gaya
 And as soon as they came there, the people of the squad started to take off that white bandage filled with gunpowder on the child's body
 lekin ye kaam behad khatarnaak he, kyonki is kaam main ek maamuli si galati kaa matlab bhi sirf or sirf maut he
 However, whether it is the mistake of pressing the switch in the bomb, the detonation of the bomb due to a technical malfunction or the suppression of another remote terrorist nearby
 ye bam badi tabaahi kaa sabab kaa sabab ban saktaa he
 On the other hand, the crowd of people from afar was watching the scene, constantly holding this color
 
 
 idhar, jaise hi ye belt pair ke raste bachche ke jism se nikaali gai, oparation kii kamyaabi ke chalate log khushi ke maare taaliyaan bajaane lage
 How terrible are the circumstances of Kirkuk, it can be gauged from the fact that before this innocent human bomb was caught, there have been two suicide attacks in this city
 jabaki isse pehle ki ye baccha bhi apane iraade main kaamyaab hota, pulisavaalon ne use pakad liya
 Not only is this the only child bomb in Iraq, but ISIS has long been poisoning the minds of children
 unhen dehshatgardi ke saanche main dhaalane main laga he
 This is the reason why hundreds of children are still learning the lesson of dying in an age in which people do not even know how to live properly
 islamic hukumat ke liye iesas kaa plan kitna khaufnak he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki wo aath saal kii umr tak se bacchon ko agava kar unhen aatankwaadi banane main juta he
 It is clear that the only and only means of joining this army of ISIS is death
 phir chaahe ye maut iesas kii ore se ladate hue aae yaa phir iesas chhod kar jane ke jurm khud iesas kii ore se di jaae

 co / 9frvy7lbre@poojafilms@wizfilmsin The state BJP unit headed by former CM BS Yeddyurappa wants to stake claim to form the next government, but is waiting for the central leadership's permission for the same
 guuruuvaar ko jagadish shettar, arvind limbavali, madhuswami, basaavraaj bommai or yediurppa ke bete vijayendra samet karnataka bijepi ke kai netaa amit shah se mili or rajya ke taaja ghatnakram tathaa party ke saamne maujuud vikalpon ke bare main charchaa kii
 The BJP, which toppled the congress-jds government in Karnataka, is now in some confusion
 bijepi netritv main is sarkaar ko giraane ke liye adhik utawala nahin tha balki use gathbandhan main daraar ke kaaran girte hue dekhnaa chahta tha
 But the BJP leaders of the state, led by BS Yeddyurappa, were in a hurry to hold power in the state, which led to a long standoff to disband the Congress mlas
 karnataka kii sarkaar to gir gai, lekin bijepi ke sthaneey netaa ab netritv kii hari jhandi kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 The central leadership is yet to reach a decision
 karnataka vidhansabha ke adhyaksh ramesh kumaar ne congress-jedies gathbandhan ke 15 baagi vidhayakon ke istife or unhen nishkasit karne ke liye unki party kii yachikaaon par abhi tak koi faisla nahin liya he
 In such a situation, it is necessary for the BJP to move cautiously, because the decision of the speaker can have an impact on the future of the next government
 karnataka main 31 july ke pehle vitt vidheyak bhi paarit karnaa hoga
 It is said that if the government is unable to keep a finance bill by the end of this month, it will be a constitutional obligation to impose President's rule to pave the way for the bill
 bijepi rajya main alpamat ke saath sarkaar bananaa nahin chaahati or chunaav ke jariye purna bahumat ke saath aakar sthir sarkaar chaahati he
 It knows that just like the congress-jds government, its minority government may have to fall two to four
 karnataka ke kaaryvahak mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami kaa guuruuvaar ko diya gaya bayaan bijepi kii ashanka kii pushti karne vaala he
 Kumaraswamy has said that under the current political conditions no one can give a stable government
 unhone kaha he ki congress-jedies gathbandhan ke baagi vidhayakon ke istifon ne rajya ko upachunaavon kii ore dhakel diya he
 He said that the BJP has created such an atmosphere
 ham yah nahin maan sakate ki chunaavon ke baad bhi sarkaar sthir rahegi
 Kumaraswamy's congress-jds government was reduced to a minority in the power-testing held in the Vidhan Sabha on July 23
 kumaraswami dwaara pesh vishwaas prastaav ke paksh main 99 or virodh main 105 mat pade the
 On the other hand, the crisis in front of Yeddyurappa, senior BJP leader of Karnataka is that if he does not become the Chief Minister this time, then the path is closed for him in future
 iske peeche unki umr roda ban rahi he
 Yeddyurappa is 76 years old and according to bjp's rule, she does not allow leaders above 75 years of age to contest
 bijepi yadi sthir sarkaar ke liye sabar karne kii niti hi apanaati he to karnataka main raashtrapati shashan lagegaa or sambhavat: saal ke ant main vidhansabha chunaav hoga
 If BJP then managed to form a government with a majority, then for Yeddyurappa, the Chief Minister's chair would remain a dream

 kangra main chaar dinon ke bheetar do baar bukamp aa chukaa he
 When scientists saw the epicenter of the earthquake, their spirit trembled
 kyonki bukamp kaa centre bilkul usee jagah ke aasapaas tha, jahaan april 1905 main bhayanak jaljla aayaa tha
 Scientists have expressed apprehension that once again an exactly similar earthquake may occur
 13 july kii aadhi raat 11 bajkar bees minute par kangra main achaanak dharti kaanp uthi
 People came out of the houses
 sabhi ke ek chehre par anjaanaa dar ta or chaaron taraf afra tafari machi thi
 Kangra earthquake intensity on the Richter scale 4
 5 maapi gai
 This was not a major earthquake, it did not cause any damage, you can breathe a sigh of relief from this news, but this earthquake was just a message
 jitne bade khatre kaa ye alarm baja gaya he, use jaanakar aap hill jaaenge
 The area where this earthquake has occurred, and where it is centered, has given the scientists sleep
 aaj se 108 saal pehle 1905 main yahaan ek vinaashkari bukamp aayaa tha
 In which more than 20 thousand people were killed and the entire Himachal was destroyed
 yani 13 july ko 4
 a magnitude 5 earthquake has occurred near the epicenter of the 1905 earthquake-prone earthquake
 yahi sabase badi chintaa kii baat he
 There has been a stir in the Himalayas
 pichley das dinon ke bheetar jammu-kashmir, himachal or uttarakhand ke kai ilaakon main paanch halke bukamp darj kiye ja chuke hai
 According to geologists, Kangra is the area of the Himalayas where there is a possibility of earthquake of magnitude 8 or more
 darasal himalay kaa nirmaan hi dharti kii do badi tectonic platon ke bich hui takkar se hua he
 The collision that began between tectonic plates about five million years ago continues to this day
 yahi vajah he ki himalay ke kshetra main bade bukampon kaa aana koi nai baat nahin he
 After studying the major earthquakes that have occurred in previous years, geologists agree on the conclusion that a major earthquake can occur in the Himalayas at any time
 haal hi main america kii stenford uniwarsity ke vaigyanikon ne bhartiya santhaan enziarai ke saath ek adhyayan main ye paaya he ki himalay main main himalayan thrust yani emechati kaaphi sakriy he
 There are indications here that an earthquake of magnitude 8 or higher on the Richter scale can cause havoc at any time
 jaankaron kii maane to bade bukamp yani 8 yaa isse zyada kii tivrata kaa bukamp jin ilaakon main aane kii ashanka he wo ilaake hai kashmir, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand, nepal, bihar kaa tarai vaala ilaaka or assam
 Scientists say that the earthquake which is being feared, if it comes, may cause a disaster in all the areas adjacent to the Himalayas
 mahabukamp kaa khatra dekhte hue neshnal dizaster management team ne himachal pradesh sarkaar ko chetavanee de di he
 Scientists say that buildings built in mountainous areas cannot withstand the earthquake
 agar shimla kii baat karen to yahaan teen lakh kii aabaadi he
 In such a situation, it would be impossible to stop the great disaster
 vaigyanikon ko maane to jahaan vinaashkari bukamp ek baar aata he, sau saal baad vaisaa hi bukamp aane kaa khatra bana rahata he
 It has been 103 years since the 1905 Himachal earthquake
 103 saal pehle himachal main bukamp ke jhatkon ne jamkar tabaahi machaai thi
 7 on the Richter scale measuring the April 4, 1905 earthquake in Kangra Valley
 8 aanki gai thi
 According to geologists, the Kangra Valley had two earthquake earthquakes
 ek centre kangra kullu or doosraa musuri-dehradun ilaake main tha
 This earthquake caused landslides in many places, rocks fell
 dharmashala kasbe kii sari kii sari imaaraten jameendoj ho gai thim
 Most of the buildings in mcleodganj and Kangra were demolished
 british gajetir ke mutabik kullu-manali, shimla, sirmaur or dehradun tak is bukamp ne apni vinashlila dikhaai thi
 If there is such a devastating earthquake, which scientists are anticipating, then those areas which are close to the Himalayas will be destroyed
 lekin ek bada sach ye bhi he ki bharat kaa koi hissaa aisa nahin he, jo bukamp ke lihaaj se bilkul surakshit ho
 Even Delhi can come 7
 9 tivrata kaa bukamp
 In the wake of the earthquake, India is divided into four parts
 sismik zone 5 yani bukamp ke lihaaz se sabase zyaada khatarnaak kshetra he
 More than 8 earthquakes of magnitude may occur in this region
 jiske baad tabaahi kii sabase khaufnak tasviir saamne aa sakati he
 This zone covers the entire North East area of the country, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal areas, Kutch in Gujarat, North Bihar and Andaman and Nicobar Islands
 duusare number par un ilaakon ko rakhaa gaya he jahaan 7
 An earthquake of magnitude 9 may occur
 These areas are placed in seismic zone 4
 ismerajdhani dilli, ensiaar ke ilaake, jammu kashmir or himachal pradesh ke ilaake, sikkam, upi, bihar or pashchim bengal kaa uttari ilaaka, gujarat kaa kuch hissaa or pashchim tat se sata maharashtra or rajasthan kaa ilaaka aata he
 Seismic zone 3 covers areas that are less prone to earthquakes
 isamen kerala, goa, lakshadeep, upi, gujarat or pashchim bengal ke bache hue ilaake, punjab, rasthaan, madhya pradesh, bihar, jharkhand chhattisgarh, maharashtra, orissa, andhra pradesh, tamilnadu or karnataka ke ilaake aate hai
 The rest of the country is seismic zone 2 where 4
 9 se zyaada kaa bukamp aane kii ashanka nahin he
 Therefore, it would not be wise to take the risk of earthquake lightly
 haal hi main himalay main badi halchal hamako alert kar rahi he
 The need is to speed up your preparations for the big earthquake

 a few months ago, sugarcane farmers' dues on sugar mills had reached Rs 23,000 crore
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki isse bani naaraazgi bhi kairana upachunaav main bijepi kii haar kii ek vajah he
 But now after the minimum support price for sugar has been fixed at Rs 29 per kg, the arrears of sugarcane farmers have come down to Rs 5,000 crore

 One proposal is to impose a luxury tax of 1 per cent

 There is still more than a month left to complete 2015, but in ODI cricket this year is proving to be the year of batsmen
 england or pakistan ke bich abudhabi main khele gaye vanade mukaable main kam se kam do aankade to isaki hi tasdik karte hai
 In England's innings, Joss Butler hit 8 sixes in a stormy manner
 ye england kii ore se kisi bhi ballebaaj kii ore se vanade cricket main sabase zyada chhakkon kaa record he
 But his sixes also created a new international record
 antarrashtriya cricket main ye saal chhakkon kaa bhi saal sabit hua he, yani vanade international main sabase zyada chakke isi saal lage hai
 In 2015, there have been 1933 sixes in ODI cricket
 isse pehle 2014 main vanade cricket main 1928 chakke lage the
 With centuries from Joss Butler and Jason Rai, England hit 355 for 5 in 50 overs against Pakistan
 ye ran pakistan ke ballebaajon ke liye kaaphi sabit hue
 The comments darasal ye is sijan international cricket main 19waan mauka he, jab kisi team ne apni pari main 350 se zyada ran bana die hai
 In the one-day matches played in 2015, teams have crossed the mark of 350 runs in their innings so far 19 times
 isse pehle doosraa sabase behatar pradarshan 2007 main tha, jab 9 baar vanade muqaabale main tiimon ne 350 ranon kaa aankada paar kiya tha
 According to this, in 2015, more than twice the teams have scored 350 runs as compared to 2007
 jaahir he international vanade cricket main saal 2015 main bane ye do aankade ballebaazon ke dabadabe ko sabit karte hai
 
 
 And it is not difficult to understand that batsmen are benefitting more from the new rules
 england kii pari main jos butler ne tufaani andaaj main 8 chakke thok die
 This is the record for the most sixes in ODI cricket by any batsman from England
 lekin unke chhakkon kii badaulat ek nayaa international record bhi ban gaya
 This year has also proved to be the year of sixes in international cricket, that is, this year, the maximum number of sixes in ODI International has taken place
 2015 main ab tak vanade cricket main 1933 chakke lage hai
 Earlier in 2014, ODI cricket had 1928 sixes
 jos butler or jesan raay ke shatakon kii badaulat england ne pakistan ke khilaaf 50 overon main 5 wicket par 355 ran thok die
 These runs proved to be enough for the Pakistan batsmen
 tippaniyan Actually this is the 19th time in international cricket this season, when a team has scored more than 350 runs in their innings
 2015 main khele gaye vanade muqablon main ab tak 19 baar timen apni pari main 350 ran kaa aankada paar kar chuki hai
 Earlier the second best performance was in 2007, when teams crossed the 350-run mark in 9 odis
 is hisaab se dekhen to 2015 main 2007 ke muqaabale main dogune se bhi zyada baar timen 350 ranon kaa score bana chuki hai
 Obviously these two figures made in the year 2015 in International ODI cricket prove the dominance of batsmen
 
 
 or isse ye samajhnaa mushkil nahin he ki nae niyamon se ballebaazon ko zyada faaydaa ho rahaa he
 But his sixes also created a new international record

 Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said that it would be a big challenge for his young team, who have to play three odis and two Test matches here, to adjust to the pace and bounce in the conditions of South Africa
 dhoni ne pehle vanade kii purv sandhya par kaha, sabase badi chunauti teji or oochaal se saamanjasy bithaana he
 If you are new to international cricket, it becomes a big challenge
 iske peeche vajah yah he ki bharat main sarvshereshth wicket par bhi aapako is tarah kii teji or oochaal nahin milti
 He said, so it becomes a bit difficult for the players who have just made their debut in international cricket
 dhoni ko haalanki vishwaas he ki unki team main kuch aise khilaadi hai, jinhen antarrashtriya str kaa anubhav he
 "but we have some players who have been playing for the last few seasons and they have done well around the world
" jab aap usee maidan par khelte hai, to aapako pataa hota he ki paristhitiyaan kisi hongi or isse phayda miltaa he
 Ultimately experience matters
 is shrunkhlaa main bhartiya ballebaajon or dakshin africa gendbaajon ke bich sangharsh dekhne ko milegaa
 Dhoni said, strategies are always made against the batsmen
 ballebaaj bhi gendbaajon se nibatane ke liye khud kii ranneeti banaate hai
 The main challenge is how you adapt your game to different situations
 ranneetiyon se adhik mahatvapurn yah he ki koun zyada ran banaata he or koun adhik wicket letaa he
 Indian bowling is considered weaker than South Africa, but Dhoni said, what is important is how you take advantage of the conditions
 dhoni ne kaha, yah mahatvapurn nahin he ki aapke paas sarvshereshth gendbaaj hai
 i think we have done well
 utaar-chadhaav aate rahete hai
 When there is dew on the field or the wicket is very flat, we really have to struggle
 yah aisa kshetra he, jisamen hamaare gendbaajon ne kaaphi acha pradarshan nahin kiya he
 He said, but if he gets help, be it a fast bowler or a spinner, he has taken advantage of it and has done well
 isliye unhone jo kiya, usase ham khush hai
 We are happy with the ups and downs
 dhoni ne sweekaar kiya ki unhone pich nahin dekhi he
 He said, you are playing anywhere, if you have saved wickets, then you can score good runs in the last eight to 10 overs
 up mahadweep main wicket dhime ho jate hai or kabhi-kabhi nae ballebaaj ke liye turant aakar shot khelnaa aasaan nahin hota
 In such a situation, we are unable to make competitive scores
 unhone kaha, agar acchhee oochaal or teji hoti he, to hamane dekha he ki ballebaaj antim aath se 10 over main ran bana lete hai or ve majboot score khadaa kar dete hai
 The Indian captain said, i think South Africa is a place where it depends to a large extent on how the conditions are, how the wicket is prepared and cloudy or sunny, when the wicket would have been good for batting
 is
 kaaphi kuch is par nirbhar karata he ki us din halaat kaise hai
 It is a fact that India will enter the series as the number one ODI team in the world, but also the fact that India has never won a bilateral series in South Africa and their record in odis is also poor
 dhoni ne kaha, yah prabal daavedaar kii baat nahin he
 The bad record is not in our minds, but there are instances when we had a chance to live the series, but we did not take advantage of it, so it is very important how you play that day
 hamane dekha he ki vanade main aapako acchhee shuruyaat kii jarurat hoti he
 With the rule of two new balls and especially if the conditions are favorable for fast bowlers, then it is important that how you play in the first 10 overs
 wicket haath main hone par antim 15 over main pratispardhi score banaaya ja saktaa he

 The mayor says that the security of the House is paramount, so there is so much force

 During this time, the Leader House read only its first page and the last page in its budget address
 pichley daravaaje se nikalnaa padaa meyar or adhikariyon konagar nigam mukhyalay chhavnee main tabdeel hone ke baavjood vipaksh lagaataar hamalavar hota hua najar aayaa

 bhaajapa ke yuva saansad varun gandhi peshey se graphic diziner yamini roy choudhary ke saath ravivaar ko ganga nadi ke tat par sthit kanchi kamkotishwar mandir main parinay sutara main bandha gaye

 Ranveer Singh, who has been successful in proving himself in the industry in a short time, will not be wrong if he is called the shining star of Bollywood
 'band baaja baraat' main dilli ke tapori ladke ke kirdaar se lekar 'bajirao mastaani' ke raubadaar kirdaar main jaan bharne vaale ranvir singh aaj apane damdaar abhinay ke balboote bulandiyon ko choote najar aa rahe hai
 In the film 'bajirao Mastani', his industry and critics and audience have become convincing
 khud is film ke diarector sanjay lila bhansaali ne ranvir ke bare main yah tak kah daalaa ki vah bajirao mastaani film ranvir singh ke bagaiyr nahin soch sakate
 Perhaps Sanjay Leela Bhansali is right here because Ranveer starrer Bajirao Mastani has surpassed Bollywood King Shahrukh Khan's film Dilwale at the box office

 SUPERB! - taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh) December 31, 2015 The film has been well received by the audience
 lekin relies hone se pehle bhi ranvir, deepika or priyanka ke film main dikhaae gaye lav tryengal ne bhi shaayad darshakon ko apni ore khinchaa
 To see the enthusiasm of 'bajirao Mastani' and 'dilwale', Bajirao also won in Aaj Tak poll
 shahrukh kii 'dilavaale' se aage nikali ranvir kii 'bajirao'bollywood ke bade stars kii behtareen filmein duusare hafte bhi box offis par pair jamaaye hue hai
 Nobody thought that Shah Rukh Khan's 'dilwale' and Ranveer Singh's 'bajirao Mastani' box office competition would be so strong
 donon hi filmein acha kama rahi hai lekin ranvir kii film ne shahrukh kii film ko peeche chhod diya
 'dilwale' had a great opening at the box office but could not stand up to 'bajirao Mastani'
 box offis collection se badhkar he amitabh bachchan kaa khat:bollywood main jahaan 100 karod se lekar 500 karod club ke stars kii industry main charchaa rahati he vahiin ranvir kaa box offis ke aankadon ko khaas tawvajo nahin dete
 But yes, appreciation does matter to them
 darasal mahanayake amitabh bachchan ne 'bajirao mastaani' dekhakar ranvir singh kii tarif kii or khud apane haath se likhaa hua khat ranvir singh tak bheja, jise paakar ranvir behad khush hue or us khat ko sambhaal kar rakh liya
 Talking about this, Ranbir said, Yes, i have been sent a note by megastar Amitabh Bachchan, the letter written by him is an award in itself
 aap maanenge nahin meri jiti hui sari trophy mere drawing room main hai, lekin mistar bachchan ke note ko maine frem karaayaa ghar par rakhane ke bajaay maine use bank bhej diya he or loker ke andar rakh diya he
 Apart from the audience of Ranvir's payment, many legends have also become convinced, so if his character of Bajirao is told that 'do not doubt the cheetah tricks, the eagle's eye and Ranvir's skill' then it is not wrong
 aaie jaanate hai ranvir ke hunar ke bare main industry ke jane maane critics kaa kya kahana he
 'long race horses are Ranveer': Taran Adarsh (film trade analyst) You see that 'bajirao Mastani' was confronted with a big film, the business gap between the two was enough for the first three days, but later it It was seen to be very less
 film ko kaaphi sweekaar kiya gaya he, saath hi film ke actors ko or khaas taur se ranvir singh ko bahut saraahaa gaya he
 He was very strong on him that he had to prove himself and bring good numbers at the box office
 to ranvir ne actor ke rup main khud ko sabit kar diya he
 In the film industry, you are always tested on the basis of your previous film, and Ranveer also gave a strong performance with Sanjay Leela Bhansali in 'goliyon Ki Rasleela: Ramlila' and this time his film has not only been appreciated by the critics but also At the box office too, it is very fast, and now Ranveer Singh's position in the industry has become even stronger, now Ranveer seems to be the 'horse of the long race'
 ''ranvir singh ko ab roak paanaa, mushkil he': vajeer singh (editor: box offis india)'bajirao mastaani' ke baad ab ranvir singh ko roak paanaa bahut mushkil he, unhen bahut pyaar mila he, sabase zyada unki acting ko saraahaa gaya he
 He has been praised by the media, critics and audience as Ranveer has surprised everyone through his acting
 sirf desh main hi nahin balki videshon se bhi bad-chadhakar darshak film ke saath-saath ranvir kii prashansa kar rahe hai
 Kamal's energy is in Ranveer: Apart from Ranveer's payment, he has another special thing is his energy level, whenever he sees him among many events, shows or fans, he seems to be in a mood of fun all the time
 shaayad unke vyaktitv se judi yah ek baat bhi unhen kai stars se alag karti he
 You can guess this through these pictures
 ranvir singh lav shav main bhi awwal:sirf filmon main hi nahin balki real life main bhi ranvir singh behad romantic hai
 Although he has never yet openly expressed his relationship, the discussion of his affair with Deepika Padukone is now common
 chaahe ranvir khulkar iskaa izhaar naa karen lekin deepika sang unki chemistry ek ko-star or ek dost se badhkar hi najar aati he
 Let's know what Deepika has to say about Ranveer Singh: Deepika said, 'ranveer is my best friend
 main bahut hi bhaavnaatmak or samvedansheel hum or asurakshit mahasoos karne kii vajah se jaldi dukhi ho jaati hum
 i can say anything in my mind in front of Ranveer
 mujhe usase kuch bhi chhipaane kii jarurat nahin padati
 He can never hurt me
 hamaara rishta bharose or anderstanding kaa he
 i love them and respect them because we have a wonderful connection

 The Government of Chhattisgarh has backed down from its decision to strategically postpone the political ruckus in the state
 rajya kii bijepi sarkaar ne SC / ST act ke nae praavdhaanon ko lagu karne ke liye rajnatik, prashasnic, saamaajik or kootnithik taiyaari kar lee thi
 For this, the State Law Department had also started an administrative initiative to implement the new instructions of the Supreme Court
 is maamle main ek mahatvapurn faisla mangalvaar ko liya janaa tha
 It was to be decided that the new provisions of the Supreme Court should be implemented as they are
 iske liye ek vishesh baithak bhi hui
 In this meeting, the recent political situation of the state and the implementation of SC / ST provisions, both the messages going to the community were seriously considered
 iske baad SC / ST act main supreme court ke nae sanshodhan ko jas kaa tas lagu karne ke maamle par chhattisgarh sarkaar ne you turn le liya
 The state government will appeal for repeal of the amendment, the government will now petition the Supreme Court to withdraw the act and request it to be repealed
 iske pehle 20 march ko supreme court ke sanshodhit praavdhaanon ko lagu karne kaa faisla sarkaar ne liya tha
 It was to be put into effect on Tuesday, but the Raman Singh government was forced to take a U-turn after the SC / ST organizations and their opposition parties were vocal
 chhattisgarh sarkaar kaa you turnis maamle ko lekar chhattisgarh mantralay main mangalvaar ko din bhar gahamaa gahami rahi
 From ministers to officers, he kept meeting the Chief Minister with the file and giving his feed back to him
 supreme court kii nai guide lines or praavdhaanon kaa hawala lekar rajya main banane vaale rajnatik samikarnon se koi mukhyamantri ko avgat karaate rahaa, to koi is faisle ko jas kaa tas lagu karne se rajya main machane vaale bavaal ko lekar, tikaa-tippanee karte rahaa
 After meeting with ministers and officers, Chief Minister Raman Singh gave a long consultation on the latest political situation in the state
 iske baad unhone ekaek you turn le liya
 State Government will not implement new provisions The government announced that now it will not only implement the new provisions of the SC / ST Act, but will move the Supreme Court to repeal it
 mukhyamantri raman singh ke mutabik is maamle main unki sarkaar supreme court main apana paksh majbootee ke saath rakhegi
 Only then a decision will be taken
 unke mutabik chhattisgarh main adivaasiyon or anusuchit jati kaa ek bada varg nivasarat he
 This decision will have a direct impact on him
 lihaaja ve puure maamle ko supreme court ke samaksh rakhenge
 After the announcement of Chief Minister Raman Singh, the Congress has come to the rescue
 use ummid thi ki is faisle ke lagu hone se uske hatho main ek bada mudda aa jayega
 With this, she will campaign against the state and take on the BJP, but the U-turn of the government has destroyed the aspirations of the Congress
 haalanki congress kaa daawa he ki uske virodh ke chalate hi bijepi sarkaar ko apana faisla palatnaa padaa
 State Congress spokesperson Shailesh Nitin Trivedi reacted to the u turn of the government and said that the BJP government had to reverse its decision due to opposition from the Congress
 unhone bijepi ko SC or ST varg kaa dushman bataaya
 Assembly elections to be held in Chhattisgarh this year, Assembly elections are to be held in Chhattisgarh in October or November this year
 iske chalate sirf congress hi nahin balki duusare saamaajik or rajnatik dal bhi sarkaar ke har ek faisle par apni nigaah gadaaye baithe hai
 They want to take any decision of Chief Minister Raman Singh to the people's court so that the political meaning of that decision can also be extracted
 is maamle main bhi aisa hi hua, chunki supreme court ke nae praavdhaanon ko lagu karne kaa nirdesh khud supreme court ne sarkaar ko diya tha
 Therefore, the responsibility of implementing it without any political profit or loss was on the state government
 siem ne congress par ksaa tanjasarkaar ne iske liye maahaul bananaa bhi shuru kar diya tha or lagu karne kii prakriya bhi, lekin is act ke nae praavdhaanon ko lekar desh bhar main mache bavaal se chhattisgarh sarkaar ke kaan khadey ho gaye
 The state's BJP government had to withdraw its decision before it could implement it due to the new political equations arising from it
 udhar mukhyamantri raman singh ne congress par tanj kasate hue kaha ki wo tamaam prashasnic faislon ko rajnatik chashme se dekhakar janata ko gumraah karne main juty he
 He said that nothing will be done from the propaganda of the Congress
 unhone daawa kiya ki is baar bhi bijepi satta main kabiz hogi
 Elections: Prime Minister Narendra Modi fiercely attacked Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee over the attack on Amit Shah and the violence in his roadshow
 ve pashchim bengal ke harbar main ek chunavi jansabha ko sambodhit kar rahe thea
 Regarding the violence in the road show of BJP President Amit Shah, PM Modi said in his meeting that yesterday the pictures of Kolkata have been seen by the whole country
 didi ke prashasan or gundatantr ne bhaajapa ke road sho ko prabhavit karne kii puri koshish kii, lekin kolkata ke logon ne unki sari koshishen naakaam kar deen
 i thank all the citizens of Kolkata for this
 piem modi ne kaha ki is baar puure desh ne dekha he ki tiemasi ne kis tarah ganatantr ko gundatantr banaakar rakhaa he
 Here the Bharatiya Janata Party is being prevented from making its point
 ummidavaaron ko chunaav ladane se, apni baat janata ke saamne rakhane se roka ja rahaa he
 PM Modi said that Didi's hooliganism will not work anymore
 gurudev rabindranath tagore ne jaise bengal kii kalpana kii thi, aaj thik usase ulta ho rahaa he
 Gurudev wanted Bengal with high head, devoid of fear
 didi ke raaj main bangla yuvaaon ke mastak par goliyaan maari ja rahi hai
 PM Modi said that the fear is that even Jai Maa Kali, Jai Maa Durga, Jai Maa Saraswati and Jai Shri Ram have become difficult to say
 agar koi yuva majaak bhi karata he, rajnatik vyangy bhi karata he, to usko jail main thuns diya jaataa he
 The bureaucracy here is an example of how much pressure is on the police here, a former IPS suicide
 piem modi ne kaha ki wo vyakti jisane puraa jivan pashchim bengal ke saamaanya maanvi ke jivan kii suraksha main laga diya, usko aatmahatya ke liye majaboor kar diya gaya
 Where the police administration is living in such awe, Gurudev did not imagine such days
 piem modi ne kaha ki jis rajya main ek IPS adhikari ko hi nyaay nahin milegaa, vahaan saamaanya maanvi kitne dar main ji rahaa hoga, ye andaja lagaana mushkil nahin he
 Freedom from fear and fear has a big role in the nephew's model of governance
 ye didi kii dariyaadilii he, meharbaani he ki, dar or bhay se puri tarah mukt hai- ghuspaithiye
 Completely free from fear and fear - go-smugglers, human smugglers, daughters smugglers
 dar or bhay se puri tarah mukt hai- didi ke tolaabaz or didi kaa sindicket
 Totally free of fear and dread - leaders with chit fund to rob the poor
 dar or bhay se puri tarah mukt hai- koyala mafia, ret mafia
 PM Modi said that even though teachers and government employees may not get salary and increments, the hired goons of TMC are paid on time
 garib ke rashan par, garib ke makaan par, manaregaa kii mazdooree tak par tolabaji hoti he
 Where no one can open an office without bargaining, you can wonder how factories and industries will come there
 jo puraani factriyaan hai, jute milen hai wo bhi ye ghuspaithiya gang band karti ja rahi he
 Those who consider selfishness and plunder to be the character of India's politics, they are having problems with BJP
 ye wo log hai jinako aaj vande maataram se takalif he
 PM Modi said that these are the people who have problems with surgical strikes and air strikes
 ye wo log hai, jo bharat ke sach se zyada pakistan ke jhooth par bharosa karte hai
 These are the people who suffer from every achievement of India, every fame
 pashchim bengal kaa yuva didi ke is daman ko chunauti dene laga he
 In his speech, PM Modi said that there is a revolt against the way the gang of aunt and nephew has maligned West Bengal
 baukhalaahat main didi dhamkiyon par utar ai he
 Inch-inch talks of revenge
 unhone kaha ki kal road sho main bhi tumne inch inch badla lene kaa bahut bada khel khelaa, lekin ye bengal kii janata he jo seene par pathar jhelti rahi lekin amit shah ko kuch hone nahin diya
 This is the people of Bengal who did not let your goons who were throwing fireballs, let not a single ball reach their president, this power has been shown by the daughters of Bengal, the youth of Bengal
 unhone kaha ki ye badla lene kaa nahin bengal main badlaav kaa daur he
 And believe me, this time the sister's nephew box is round
 chunaav nattejey aane ke baad bhattije ke offis par taala laganaa tay he
 PM Modi said that by the way, i have been told that nephew's office too has been built by occupying the road, following the tradition of TMC
 didi main jo buraaiyaan thi to thi lekin unhone left waalon se buraaiyaan lekar use dabl kar diya he
 The Prime Minister said that once again on 23 May
 
 
 modi sarkaar
 
 
 Will come, then we are going to do an important work
 ghuspaithiyon kii pahchaan kii jaaegi
 Their entire curriculum vitae will be explored
 border ko aadhunik fensing se or surakshit kiya jayega
 Not only this, the companions who are persecuted due to faith need to worry about the lives of refugees here
 ham naagarikta kanoon main sanshodhan karne vaale hai
 So that every child of Maa Bharti can get citizenship which has no place other than India
 chunavi raily main piem modi ne kaha ki sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas hamaara mantra he, or sabko suraksha, sabko sammaan hamaara pran
 We have decided that by 2022 every poor should have a pucca house
 2022 tak har parivaar ke paas bijli ho, ghar main gas kaa chulhaa ho
 Farmer's income to double by 2022
 hamaara sankalp he ki jo yuva saathi hai, unako avasar mili
 PM Modi said that our emphasis is on developing infrastructure in the entire West Bengal including Diamond Harbor
 balki ham to port-led development ko promote kar rahe hai
 We are working sincerely with the resolve of the new India of the 21st century, so the whole country is trusting us

 ) With my mind repeating these lines of Kalidasa's Meghdoot in front of Gangotri, when i turned my eyes around Gomukh, the same thought came to my mind: These icebergs cannot belong to this earth! i felt that i belong in some other world

 The angle of religion also comes into this

 In this scenario, the population growth of every state is observed, which was forecast by the National Population Commission of India 2001-2026 in 2006
 ab iskaa purvanumaan ab 2080 tak ke liye kiya gaya he
 According to this, the population in the Ganges basin will be about one and a half times by 2040

 Water will also be drawn from existing resources to grow grain
 asal main, pani kii maang aabaadi main badhotari ke saath upabhokta maang or vishwa bazaar ke vikaas se bhi hota he
 The forecast of the Water Resource Group says that the water requirement for irrigation by the year 2030 is 2 annually
 4 fisadi kii dar se badhegi
 That is, by 2040, the demand for water will increase by 80 percent compared to today
 isi shodh patr main kaha gaya he ki audyogic kshetra main utpaadanon kii jaruraton ke liye pani kii maang chauguni ho jaaegi
 The subject is such that we and you need to worry

 The burden on the population is many times more
 jaisaa ki gandhi ji kehete the, prakruti ke paas hamaari aavashyaktaa puri karne laayak bahut he, par hamaari laalach puri karne laayak nahin
 We need to work on two fronts
 ek taraf nadiyon ko bachaana hoga, duusari taraf aabaadi par prabhavi dhang se lagaam lagaani hogi
 Otherwise, the third world war may not be for water, civil war will definitely take place

 Japan supported India on Doklam standoff Japan was the only country to extend its support to India and Bhutan on the Doklam standoff through diplomatic channels
 japan ke dilli main ucchayukta kenji hiramatsu ne indian express se kaha, 'hamaari samaj ke mutabik do maheene se doklam ilaake main gatirodh chal rahaa tha
 The most important thing in this disputed area was that no party should try to change the status quo in its own way and the matter should be resolved peacefully
 'sutron ke mutabik modi or abe ke bich gandhinagar main baatcheet hogi or donon mumbai-ahmedabad ke bich mahatvakankshi hai speed rail project ke liye bhoomi pujan kaarykram main shaamil honge

 a number of issues are likely to be discussed between the two leaders
 isamen raksha, asia prashanth, parmaanu sahyog or kshetra main sanyukt vikaas ke projects par baat ho sakati he
 Prior to Abe's visit, Foreign Secretary s Jaishankar said that promoting cooperation between the two countries in the field of civil nuclear energy and defense is on the agenda and suggests that bilateral relations will move towards this in future

 bhartiya salaami ballebazvirendra sahvaagne sweekaar kiya he ki chaar saal pehle bhartiya team se baahar hone ke baad unhone apane khel main badlaav kiya jo ant main unke liye kaaphi phydemand sabit hua
 Sehwag was quoted as saying in a media release, "when i was dropped from the team in 2007, no one expected the selectors to dismiss me but they did because of poor form
" isi ke baad maine soch or khilne ke tareeke ke aadhaar par apane khel main badlaav kiye

 'sehwag said,' i scored just 20 runs in two hours
 kya aap kalpana kar sakate ho ki sahvaag do ghante main 20 ran banaaye? main is tarah nahin kheltaa lekin sirf test match bachaane ke liye maine apane khel main badlaav kiya
 'sehwag mentioned' Upper Cut 'as one of the shots that changed his game

 He, however, said that he did not practice the shot on the net
 unhone kaha, ‘kuch chijen naiysargik taur par aapke khel main aa jaati hai or apper cat unamem se ek he

 ’sahvaag ne kaha, ‘apper cat ke saath tej gend par main aasaani se third main kshetra main chakka maar saktaa hum jo gendbaajon ko hairaan kar detaa he
 It came into my game naturally so it became easy to become perfect

 Setoti was to participate in the presidential election to be held in March 2013
 tippaniyan The Kenyan Red Cross has said that the four bodies have been burnt so badly that they cannot be identified
 durghatana ke kaarnon kaa pataa nahin chal sakaa he
 Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki described the deaths as a major loss for Kenya
 pradhanmantri raliya odinga ne bhi is ghatana par dukh vyakt kiya he

 dilli vidhansabha chunaav main karaari haar kaa saamana karne ke baad bijepi ne abhi se nagar nigam chunaav kii ranneeti par kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 In view of this, they are in the mood to place bets on new faces
 nae chehron ko utaar kar ve satta virdohi lahar par kaabo paanaa chaahate hai
 Big party leaders feel that they can cash in on the demonetisation decision in favor of demonetisation along with the new faces and popularity of PM Modi
 is taiyaari ke maddenjar dilli bijepi ke netaa un vaardon kii pahchaan kar rahe hai jahaan parshadon kii chhavi thik nahin he
 Actually, the party is not unified about the selection of candidates within the BJP
 aise main pradesh adhyaksh sahit kai bade netaa sanghathan kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane waalon ko chunaav se dur rakhana chaahate hai
 For the last 10 years, the Aam Aadmi Party and Congress have been continuously targeting the BJP, which took over the power of the municipal corporation
 dilli kii badahaal safai vyavastha or nagar nigam ke bhrashtachar ke liye bijepi ko hi jimmedaar tehraaya jaataa rahaa he
 Concerned about this, BJP leadership also feels that after Manoj Tiwari became the state president, the party's position in Purvanchal and unauthorized colony has strengthened
 vahiin unhen is baat kaa dar he ki kharaab report card vaale parshadon ko phir sechunavi maidanamen utaarne se nagar nigam kii hetric kaa sapana tut saktaa he
 For this reason, special caution has been asked to select candidates
 party kii report ke anusaar jahaan purvi or uttari dilli main parshadon ko lekar naaraazgi he
 At the same time, the situation of the councilors of South Delhi Municipal Corporation is better
 party kii report main uttari nagar nigam or purvi dilli nagar nigam ke parshadon ko lekar zyada naaraazgi he jabaki dakshini dilli nagar nigam main parshadon kii sthiti behatar he
 Despite this, cutting tickets of existing councilors is not so easy
