 It is not possible for every party to go to the parlor, so if the party makes some quick tips for you, then all the confusion will be solved in minutes
 yahaan ham aapako bataa rahe hai aise tips jo party main sabase khubasurat dikhne ke liye har ladki ke kaam aaenge
 
 
 This is how to do makeup-1
 chehre ko fresh or natural luk dene ke liye sabase pehle concillar kaa istemaal karen
 For this, use two shades of concealer
 lite concillar ko ankhon ke paas lagaaein or dark concillar ko chehre ke baaki hisson par aplai karen
 Then apply the rest of the makeup
 2
 If you want to enhance the beauty of the face, then always take care to apply dark lipstick on the lips and lighten the face makeup
 3
 To make your lips look beautiful and bold, first apply concealer on the lips
 uske baad jis color kii lipstick aap lagane ja rahi hai usee color ke lipliner se hothon kii outlining karen
 By doing this your lips will look very attractive and your lipstick will last for a long time
 4
 Your eyes are recognized by your face, so take special care when applying them
 sabase pehle lite color ke foundation se base taiyaar kar len
 After this, apply liner from top to bottom with light gray color keyliner pencil
 baad main ise ungaliyon kii sahaayta se smaj kar den
 This gives a smokey look
 iske baad masakaara lagaaein
 5
 baalo ko fatafat set karne ke liye thodi si maatra main phase kriim lagane se unamem chamak aa jaaegi
 By doing this, dry hair also looks perfect
 aap chahen to ruukhe baalo ke liye serum yaa phir jail lagaakar bhi baalo ko set kar sakati hai
 It is better to leave the hair uncovered than making a new hairstyle

 You will be surprised to know that Rukmini, who passed this exam in 2011, failed in class 6 and she passed this exam without any coaching
 rukmini kaa janm sevanivruth deputy distric atorni (hoshiyarpur) baljinder singh ke yahaan hua tha or unhen choti si umr main hi boarding skool bhej diya gaya tha
 But she got very upset and failed in class 6
 unhone radiff ko die apane intervyuu main bataaya tha ki jab wo kaksha chaar main thim to unhen boarding skool main bhej diya gaya or main yah badlaav sahan nahin kar saki
 Doctor Rukmini was so shocked by the fact that this mother made her daughter by planting a broom and vegetable shop, during this time she started living in depression
 unhen pataa hi nahin tha ki unke saath kya ho rahaa he
 After being in this tension for a long time, he thought that he would have to face this problem
 iske saath hi unhone apni asafalataa se sikh lee
 They say that if we are determined then failures can never stop our path and they worked hard
 pair nahin hai, haath main sirf do ungliyaan! phir bhi pariksha main kiya kamalunhone kaha ki fail hone ke baad parivaar ke log or shikshakon ke saamne jane kii unki himmat nahin hoti thi

 input: bhashaa Now there is also a discussion in the political corridor that if senior Congress leader and former Union Minister Shakeel Ahmed too turn to Janta Dal United, then it will not be surprising

 Most Muslim leaders believe that if they go to the electoral arena in alliance with RJD in the next assembly elections, they are sure to lose
 lekin agar nitish kaa saath ho jate hai to unhen koi parajeet bhi nahin kar saktaa
 Muslim leaders also say that even though Nitish is with the BJP, the work he has started under different schemes for the Muslim community also has an impact on the ground
 use nazarandaaz kar keval dharmanirpekshata ke naam par kab tak vot maange ja sakate hai
 These leaders believe that BJP cannot implement its agenda beyond a limit as long as Nitish Kumar is in the lead

 The controversy has arisen only after actor Anupam Kher was appointed to the post of the head of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII)
 kher ko chairman niyukti karne ke faisle par sawaal uthaate hue santhaan ke chaatr sangh ne aarope lagaaya ki yah hiton ke takaraav kaa maamla he, kyonki kher mumbai main apana khud kaa abhinay prashikshan santhaan chalaate hai
 The FTII Students Union (FSA) has also objected to the statements made by Kher during the debate on intolerance in the country and his efforts to 'propagate some of the government's views'
 vahiin soshal media par bhi yugers anupam kher kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 However, he made it clear that as far as Kher's qualifications and credentials are concerned, he has no problem
 ennee ke adhyaksh robin joy ne kaha ki jahaan tak kher kii yogyata or saakh kii baat he, koi dikkat nahin he
 But he runs his own acting training institute - Actor Prepares - in Mumbai and is now tasked with leading a government institute which surely leads to conflict of interest
 unhone kaha ki sawaal yah he ki ek nijee upkram kaa netritv karne vaale vyakti ko kaise kisi sarkari santhaan kaa netritv karne ke liye kaha ja saktaa he
 Asked if he would oppose Kher's appointment in the same way his predecessors had done in 2015 on Gajendra Chauhan's appointment, Joy said he could not say anything at this time, further action
 But the decision will be taken at the FSA General Assembly meeting

 The Chief Minister of Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, has been surrounded by his own leaders in the matter of apologizing to former Punjab cabinet minister Bikram Singh Majithia
 vahiin, bijepi ne bhi unpar jhooth kii raajnneeti karne kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha ki kejariwal ko dilli or punjab kii janata se maafee maangani chahie

 bataa den, aam aadmi party ne kejariwal kii maafee par kaha tha kii unpar chal rahe manahani ke kai maamalon ke kaaran unka kaaphi vakt court kachhari main nikal jaataa he
 Therefore, the apology will save the cm's time, which will allow more time for public issues
 aam aadmi partike is bayaan par vijender gupta ne kaha ki kejariwal ke paas apane aaropon ko loar court main sabit karne ke liye bhi aadhaar nahin he or isliye itani jaldi unhone ghutane tech die
 It is just messing with public sentiments
 bijepi akali vidhayak manjinder singh sirsa ne bhi kejariwal ke maafeename par chutki lete hue kaha ki, mujhe yaad he ki kejariwal ne video banaaya tha logon ko kol gaye the ki main itani taarikh ko majithia ko jail main band kar duungaa
 We used to say even then that Arvind Kejriwal is a liar
 aaj vahi baat kejariwal khud bol rahe hai ki haa main jhootha tha
 Sirsa accused Kejriwal and said that how can the people of Delhi trust such a CM
 sirsa ne bhagwant maan ke istife par kaha ki ye istipha pre pland he
 Sirsa alleged that in the Aam Aadmi Party, all planning is done first, what to say to whom

 The BJP took strong attack on Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde accusing him and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh of running a terrorist training camp and demanded an apology from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi
 bijepi pravaktaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘grahamantri ke bayaan main unki (congress) vidhwanskaari maansikta jhalkati he
 The statement he has made in the contemplation camp is extremely objectionable
 yah na keval asweekaarya he, balki khatarnaak bhi
 He said that Shinde's statement is intended to disrupt peace and harmony in the country
 sangh ko ek ‘rashtravaadi sanghathan’ bataate hue bijepi netaa ne kaha, ‘sonia gandhi ko maafee maangani chahie
 Rahul Gandhi and the Home Minister should also apologize, otherwise it will have serious consequences
 yah sweekaarya nahin he
 The home minister saying such nonsense is like giving a clean chit to the real terrorists
 ’bijepi pravaktaa ne yah bhi kaha ki scindia ke bayaan se pakistan samarthit aatankwaad ko ‘oxygen’ mil gayi he
 He said, 'you have also strengthened anti-india terrorist groups
 ’nakvi ne kaha, ‘kai baar main mahasoos karata hum ki congress kaayron kii jamaat ban gayi he
 i am saying this because there are repeated terrorist attacks in the country, terrorists are flourishing here
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘pakistani sainik hamaare javaanon ke sar kaat dete hai or hamaare pradhanmantri is par pratikriya jaahir karne main itnaa lanbaa samay lete hai
 Our government thinks again and again before reacting to such incidents
 vah desh ke andolit hone par hi pakistan ko chetavanee detii he lekin vah chetavanee bhi sirf chetavanee hoti he jisase majaak banataa he
 Significantly, while addressing the Congress Chintan Camp in Jaipur on Sunday, Shinde alleged that the BJP and the Sangh are running 'terrorist training camps' to spread saffron terrorism in the country
 scindia ne kaha tha, ‘jaanch ke dauraan yah report ai he ki bijepi or sangh aatankwaad failaane ke liye aatankwaadi prashikshan shivi chalaa rahe hai
 Bombs are planted in Samjhauta Express, Mecca Masjid, and also in Malegaon
 ’ baad main scindia ne kaha, ‘yah bhagava aatankwaad he jisaki main baat karata hum
 This is the same thing and nothing new
 yah kai baar media main aa chukaa he

 ) grahamantri susheel kumaar scindia ne mujffarnagar sampradayik hinsa main raajnneetik partiyon kaa haath hone kii ashanka jataai he
 He has denied holding the UP government responsible for the Muzaffarnagar riots and said that the disclosure regarding the political conspiracy would be possible only after the investigation of the case
 mujffarnagar sampradayik hinsa ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, dekhie main kisi ko dosha nahin duungaa
 The UP government has failed, etc
 
 
 puure 11 rajyon ko hamane alert kar diya tha
 There is a possibility of a riot
 jaise-jaise loksabhaa chunaav najadik aaenge kai raajnneetik partiyaan dharmik maahaul bigaadane kaa kaam kar sakati hai
 We had already given such information
 'susheel kumaar scindia ne kaha, 'sampradayik hinsa keval ek rajya main hi nahin hue hai, kai anya rajyon main bhi aisa hua he
 But the effort is on to control what happened in Uttar Pradesh
 hamane danga grast ilaakon main 80 company ardhsainik balaur sena kii tukadiyaan bheji hai
 The situation in the city has improved but the village is still tense
 hamen aisi jaankaree mili he
 On the question of political conspiracy in the riots, he said, 'I cannot say anything on this at the moment
 jab tak jaanch naa ho jaae
 Whether there is any conspiracy in it
 isapar kuch kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 Attempting politicians not to go to the riot-affected areas, he said, "in such an environment, the leaders should not leave until the situation becomes normal
" kyonki usase sthiti bigadane kii ashanka rahati he
 Going after four days will not make any difference
 sena or prashasan sthiti ko saamaanya karne main juty he
 When the Home Minister was asked on the PM candidature of Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the riots, he said, 'anybody can announce the Prime Ministerial candidate
 koi bhi choti-badi party aisa kar sakati he
 Tomorrow Ramu, Samu, Damu can do it
 ye us party kaa maamla he
 But we have already said that our leader is Rahul Gandhi
 ' Salman Khan says he is desperate
 salmaan jab hataasha or niraashaa main duube hote hai, to duusare sitaron kii tarah na to cigarette kaa sahaara lete hai na hi sharaab kaa
 Salman's inner painter awakens in frustration
 kuchi ne bhi nahin diya sakhbhinayta salmaan khan ek chitrakaar bhi hai kyonki ki wo hataash hai
 Salman Khan's frustration does not end here
 kuchi or canvas bhi salmaan kaa saath nahin dete
 They spend many nights to see Katrina's lovely forgotten appearance in pictures
 salmaan us vakt rangon kaa sahaara lete hai jab puri duniya so jaati he
 But even a lot of colors together do not make Salman's black and black nights colorful
 had to tab ho jaati he jab wo katrina kii surat main maamle main bhi gachha kha jate hai
 Salman has not been able to execute Haseen Katrina exactly till date
 tasviir na banane se badi hataashajab katrina kii tasviir nahin banati to salmaan kii hataasha or bad jaati he, lekin kaabil e tarif ye hai ki is hataasha kii aandhi main bhi unki soch khatm nahin hoti
 Salman's colors do not dry, even if the picture does not become a pleasant one, but he is happy that the canvas has become colorful
 yani ki banane kuch jate he or ban kuch or jaataa he
 Now it is expected from God when hope is lost from everywhere, man looks at God
 salmaan kaa bhi yahi falsafa he
 When the colors do not support, the crutch does not work according to the mind, then Salman starts to realize the God of his imagination in the canvas
 salmaan hataash he, niraash he lekin chitrakaar salmaan nahin kyonki wo to ishwar kii sharan main hai
 Salman hopes that one day his petting will overcome all his frustration
 jaag uthaa bheetar kaa darshanajab kalakaar hataash hota he to uski bheetar kaa darshan jaagta he
 This is happening here with Salman Khan as well, but what is the reason that Salman Khan has become so desperate that he has to resort to brush and canvas
 katrina se salmaan shaadi kab karenge ye sawaal salmaan ke gale main haddi kii tarah atka he, jabaki salmaan katrina ko pyaar ke do labj nahin kah pate
 Whether or not Salman will be able to make Katrina his life partner can be the biggest tension in Salman's life
 aane vaali filmon ko lekar bhi tanavhit filmon kaa swaad chakhaa salmaan ko arsa ho gaya he
 Salman Khan's films come but there is also flop from Dhadalla
 aise main salmaan kii apni aanevaali film wanted or landan drims ko lekar salmaan behad tanaav main honge hi
 Salman Khan is the only hero of Bollywood who has kept the most enemies
 ye baat alag he ki salmaan ko apane dushmano se koi jyaad fark nahin padataa, lekin salmaan kaa haal ab aisa ho gaya he ki salmaan ke paas doston kii kami hone lagi he
 Salman's tension in such a situation is to worry about persuading friends
 salmaan jitne zyada lokapriy he utana hi zyada kariyar vivaadit rahaa he
 Then whether it is a case of black deer hunting in Rajasthan or the hit ang run case of Mumbai
 salmaan ko abhi is tanaav se puri tarah jhutkaaraa nahin mila
 Many times, child-like acts were held in Mumbai for the well-being of the children and another chief guest was to be adored but Salman, who made everyone wait, was forced to wait
 pehle to salmaan khan muskuraate rahe, baaten karke man bahalaate rahe, lekin kab tak aise hi chalata
 Why should we not be tired? intazaar karne kii itani aadat nahin nahin he na, so thakaan mitaane ke liye haazir ho gaya maalish vaala
 After doing his massage for five minutes, what would Sallu Mian do, so now he took up the paper nearby and started making boats
 yani kho gayi apane bachapan main
 The boat could not be built from Salman, so Salman ate the paper
 bilkul bacchon kii tarah
 Now you have to wait so much, you will feel hungry
 vakt ko kaatane ke liye salmaan press se baaten karne lage, tab jaakar salmaan khan ko sukun mila

 When she was a year old, an acquaintance threw acid on her face and made her face ugly

 But according to the company's claim, its camera was excellent
 is tasviir ko twitor yujar evan blass ne apane acount main share kiya he
 From the dual camera in the leaked picture, we can guess that the company will have given the advanced camera in the new Pixel 2

 Sonali Bendre was diagnosed with high grade cancer in July last year
 ve iske baad america apana ilaaj karaane chali gayi thi
 Sonali returned to India after a long battle with the disease
 sonaali ne cancer kii beemaari ko public kiya tha kyonki ve apni beemaari ke saath hi lakhon-karodon logon ko is khatarnaak beemaari se ladane ke liye prerit karnaa chaahati thim
 He has shared many stages of his journey with fans on social media
 haal hi main sonaali ne instagram par ek tasviir share kii he
 In this picture, she is seen with her 20-inch wound that she received from cancer surgery
 unhone is tasviir ko capshan dete hue likhaa ye idia behad avishwasaneey tha
 No hair on the head and no make-up, other than that, such a big wound on the chest
 vog india jaisi fishan magazine ke liye ye ek paaramparik or saadhaaran nahin tha
 But i think it has become common for me now
 jaahir he, ye mere liye aasaan nahin tha or main kaaphi insikyor bhi thi lekin priya tanna or anaeta shroff adzania ke saath baat karne ke baad main is shoot ke liye taiyaar ho pai thi
 View this post on instagramthe idea was almost preposterous
 An almost bald head, barely any make-up and a huge scar was not the norm for @vogue
 But, i guess that's my new normal
 Of course i had my reservations, and, if i dare say, insecurities - but a candid conversation with the lovely ladies @priya_tanna and @anaitashroffadajania cleared my doubts
 And before i knew it, i was standing in front of the camera, ready to uncover my new reality
 The icing on the cake was the fact that i needed one-third of the time for hair and make-up😄
 So i closed my eyes and jumped into it, full throttle, and this is the result
 Thank you, @meghamahindru for telling my story; and thank you @ridburman for understanding my story and saying it so beautifully through your lens
 If there's a piece of advice i can give you all after this, it would be to 'find your new normal'
 It's very liberating

 unhone is seshan ke dauraan bataaya tha ki ki cancer se ladane ke liye sabase zyada jaruri kya he
 He had said, 'it is very important to have insurance because cancer treatment is expensive
 aap hameshaa sochate hai ki ye aapke saath nahin hoga or aap uske liye taiyaar nahin hote hai
 But i can say from my experience that insurance is very important
 ' Every room says something
 
 
 ji haa, is vakt kuch aisa hi cameraa-puraana dilli main congress mukhyalay main chal rahaa he
 a room in the headquarters at '24, Akbar Road 'is under the watch of all Congress leaders
 vajah bhi aapako bataa dete hai
 In fact, when Rahul Gandhi became Congress president instead of Sonia Gandhi, the son got the vacant room of his mother
 aise memrahulka purana cameraa jo bataur party upaadhyaksh unhen mila hua tha, wo khaali ho gaya
 Now there is no nameplate outside this room
 aise main party kaa har bada netaa chahta he ki ye cameraa use mil jaae
 How important is the seat, the nearest house, the nearest room, to keep the supreme leader always with him, the same can be seen in the Congress headquarters
 sonia gandhi ke congress adhyaksh rahete hue unke kamare ke aasapaas ke do camrepartikoshadhyaksh motilal vora or sanghathan sachiv janardan dvivedi ko mili hue the
 Motilal Vora's room is still intact
 desh ke sabhi congressjanon ko sandesh saaf tha ki, sonia ke rajnatik salaahkaar ahamed patel ke baad koun se do netaa unke sabase vishwaasapaatr or kareebi hai
 Ahmed Patel did not have a separate room at the Congress headquarters
 jab sonia gandhi mukhyalay main aati thim to ahamed patel kabhi unke yaa phir kabhi motilal vora ke kamare main baith jate the
 When Rahul Gandhi became the General Secretary in the Congress, his name plate was placed on the room containing Janardan Dwivedi
 ek baar phir sandesh saaf dikhaa ki party main kad ke hisaab se sonia gandhi ke baad rahul
 That is, the same room as it is
 kamare kii ye siyasat or usase judaa sandesh congress mukhyalay main kisi se chupa nahin he
 The main building of the Congress headquarters has rooms in the front with Ambika Soni, Janardan Dwivedi, Digvijay Singh and Kamal Nath
 vahiin back said main mukul vaasanic, bike hariprasad ke kamare hai
 These are the leaders who are considered close to Sonia Gandhi
 front main ek cameraa madhusudan mistre kaa he, jo rahul ke kareebi maane jate hai
 In such a situation, when Rahul's new team is announced, there will be room for the partition accordingly
 jaise haal main rahul ne apane kareebi arpyen singh ko jharkhand kaa prabharee or kaarysmiti kaa member banaaya to unako mukhya building main bike hariprasad ke saath cameraa mil gaya
 Now everyone's eyes are fixed on the room next to Rahul because, on the one hand, there is the room of the treasurer Motilal Vora, who was at the age of 90
 isaliye rahul ke kamare ke duusari ore ke kamare par tamaam netaaon kaa dil atka hua he ki, vahaan jisaki takhti lagegi uske rahul kaa kareebi hone kaa zordaar sandesh jayega
 Whatever the wishes of the party leaders, but Rahul has taken a break to avoid this unnecessary message
 ab ye khaali cameraa kisi netaa ko dene kii jagah rahul ke staff ke liye rigerv kar diya gaya he
 Actually, Vora ji is beyond 90 years, so he is not considered by the leaders of Team Rahul in his competition and everyone respects him in terms of age
 rahul ye nahin chaahate ki, koi aisa sandesh jaae ki, koi unka kareebi he yaa unki koi chaukadi he
 In such a situation, they thought it better to give the accompanying empty room to the staff
 ab ye baat alag he ki isse kai netaaon ke dil zarur tut gaye honge

 England captain Alastair Cook's captaincy and poor tactics have been constantly criticized, and now demand has begun that Cook's captaincy should be taken away
 purv captain maaikel won ne isibi se unki captaini chhinane par vichaar karne ko kaha he
 According to Vann, 'we have reached a position with Cook when he is not enjoying cricket
 tab aap aisa nahin kar sakate jab aap acha nahin khel rahe ho or team sangharsh kar rahi ho
 The former captain said that England's position should have been stronger in the second Test against India but the match is on par due to poor strategy
 cook mushkil samay se guzar rahe hai
 The team has failed to win the last nine matches under his guidance and he himself has not been able to score a century from 26 innings

 This also indicates that the real income of the people is low and is also declining (as other factors contributing to it, the nominal interest rate has been declining over the years
 )dysposbal inakam main giravatalogon kii aay ghat rahi he, yah koi rahasy kii baat nahin he
 In a study conducted by State Bank of India in August to find out the root cause of the current demand decline, it is because the growth in both urban and rural areas has remained in single digits in FY19, while a few years ago it was in double digits

 Imbalance of savings and investment
 How are different sectors investing in the economy? Now again the Reserve Bank figures present some interesting picture

 According to the Reserve Bank, the decline in the savings and investment gap of the private corporate sector shows that the sector is financing most of its investments with its own savings, and there is no hunger to acquire new investments
 duusari taraf, saarvajanik kshetra ke bachat-nivesh kii khai yah sanket detii he ki sarkaar apni gatividhiyon ke vittaposhan ke liye pariwaron kii bachat par lagaataar nirbhar he

 He said that this situation calls for more government investment, but at the same time he warned that investment should be only in the form of capital expenditure

 On Monday, he along with hundreds of teachers demonstrated at the Lieutenant Governor's office and came to know about his salary status on Tuesday
 darasal purvi dilli nagar nigam se jude skulon ke shikshakon ko beete 3 maheene or uttari dilli ke shikshakon ko beete 2 maheene se selary nahin mili he
 Now there are many families, who are finding it difficult to afford their home
 vibha kahati hai ki ab yah roj kaa ho gaya he
 Salary does not come for three to four months, then if the High Court rebukes, then 1 month salary is given
 iske baad phir se sthiti waisi hi ho jaati he
 But this situation is not limited to teachers or employees only
 purvi dilli nagar nigam ke mukhyalay main hamen do darjan se zyada aise log mili jo apni pement lene ke liye beete 2 saal se yahaan bhatak rahe hai
 These people are saying that their tractors are attached to the East Delhi Municipal Corporation
 tractor ke jariye kooda uthvaaya jaataa he, lekin 23 maheene se inhen inke kaam kii pement nahin hui he
 It says what a clean India campaign it is, when the payment is not being made in lieu of lifting dirt in the capital of the country
 yah log yahaan aaj bhi apni fariyaad lekar aae, lekin pataa chalaa ki meyar sahiba party ke kaam kii baithak main vyast hai to nahin aaengi
 So everyone went back to their home

 The Vice Chancellor and the Registrar were taken hostage by the students for demanding inclusion of two external members in the committee investigating the matter
 bataaya jaataa he ki chaatro ko kaabo karne ke liye police ne kathith rup se lathicharge kiya or unhen pakadakar ghasita
 Students allege that the police also misbehaved with the girl students involved in the protest

 According to the Meteorological Department, a western disturbance in Jammu and Kashmir has knocked
 is wedar system kaa asar agle do dinon tak bane rahane kii sambhaavna he
 It is being said that the current WD is not very powerful but due to this there is a great possibility of changing the weather in the high altitude areas as well as the Kashmir Valley
 dablyoody kaa sabase zyada asar 4 november ko dekha jayega
 This simply means that in the next 24 hours, weather will change in all areas of Jammu and Kashmir, but the effect of this weather system will not be visible in the plains of northwest India at the moment
 mausam vibhaag ke diarector aar vishen ke mutabik jammu-kashmir main dastak dene vaala western disterbence thodaa kam taqatvar he lihaaja iskaa mukhya asar jammu or kashmir main hi dikhegaa
 Apart from this, there is possibility of light rain or snowfall in the tribal areas adjoining Kashmir in Himachal Pradesh
 is wedar system kaa sabase zyada asar kashmir ghati ke asapaas ke oonchai vaale ilaakon main dekhne ko milegaa
 But there is no possibility of heavy rain or snowfall due to this
 kashmir ghati ke taapmaana kii baat karen to yahaan par raat ke taapmaana philhal thodaa upar uth jaaenge lekin din ke taapmaana main thodi giravat dekhi jaaegi
 But when this weather system gets ahead, the trend of temperature decline will start in all areas of Kashmir from 5th
 kamjor western system kaa doosraa bada asar punjab or haryana ke mausam par bhi najar aayega lekin ye asar barish yaa badal ke taur par nahin balki yahaan par agle 48 ghanton tak nami kii maatra badhane kii vajah se kai ilaakon main kohre kii sthiti thodaa bighad jaaegi
 Due to air pollution already present in these areas, the smog condition will remain for the next two days
 punjab, haryana, dilli or pashchimi uttar pradesh main is samay hawa ekadam shant he or yahaan par hawaaen upar se neeche kii taraf baith rahi hai
 Because of this, air pollution is trapped in this area
 is sthiti ko mausam vigyaan kii bhashaa main anti cychlonic condishan kehete hai
 According to the Meteorological Department, there is a halt in the entire area at the height of one to one and a half kilometers, but this situation will change after November 5, and with this, the smog situation will improve in all areas of North India and the chances of getting rid of it
 Will increase
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 10veen or 12veen kaksha kii board pariksha main shaamil hone ja rahe chaatro ko shubhakamanaayen dete hue kaha ki unhen pariksha ko lekar chintaa nahin kerani chahie
 During his address 'mann Ki Baat' aired on the radio, the Prime Minister told the students that the exam is a way to recognize their potential, so students should recognize their strengths
 unhone yah suzav bhi diya ki chaatro ke man se pariksha kaa hauva dur karne ke liye skulon main har saal do baar 'pariksha utsav' kaa aayojan kiya janaa chahie
 PM Modi said, "my suggestion to the teachers is why not celebrate the examination festival twice a year, in which the poems related to the exam are recited, satirized on the exam, cartoons are made on the exam
" isse chaatro ke man se pariksha kaa hauva dur karne main badi madad milegi
 He said that the studies that the students have woken up overnight, will not go in vain
 unhen apni kshamta par bharosa rakhana chahie
 Never stress too much in the examination, it should not be taken as a burden
 chaatro ko puraani baton main na jeene kii salaah dete hue modi ne kaha ki unhen vartmaan main jivan jeena chahie or pariksha main apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa chahie
 Attempting parents not to create examinations in the minds of the students, the Prime Minister said that students should not be asked after coming through the exam everyday, how was the paper done? tamilnadu ke rahane vaale aar kaamat kii salaah se sahmati jataate hue modi ne chaatro se kaha ki unhen 'varier' yani chintamagn hone kii bajaay 'warrior' yani yoddha bananaa chahie
 The Prime Minister said, Mahatma Buddha used to say 'may Atidipo Bhav' means you become his guide
 main maanata hum ki aapke bheetar jo prakaash he, use pahachaanie
 In his 25-minute address, encouraging the students, the Prime Minister said, "I do not know, to whom my words will work
" lekin mujhe santosh hoga ki chaliye mere yuva doston ke jivan ke mahatvapurn pal par main unke bich tha, apane man kii baaten unke saath gunaguna rahaa tha
 He also said, i have been a very normal student in a way, because i did not get good results in any exam in my life
 meri to handriting bhi bahut kharaab thi
 The Prime Minister said, i would like to say one thing to you today that how you take the exam depends on how your exam will be
 adhiktam logon ko maine dekha he ki wo ise apane jivan kii ek bahut badi mahatvapurn ghatana maanate hai or unako lagata he ki nahin, ye gaya to sari duniya dub jaaegi
 Friends, the world is not like this
 or isliye kabhi bhi itnaa tanaav mat paaliye
 Yes, the intention should be to bring good results and encouragement should also be elevated
 unhone kaha, kabhi-kabhaar aisa nahin lagata ki ham hi pariksha ko ek boj bana dete hai? ghar main or boj banane kaa ek kaaran jo hota he, ye hota he ki hamaare jo rishtedaar hai, hamaare jo yaar dost hai, unka betaa yaa beti hamaare bete kii barabari main padhate hai, agar aapkaa betaa dasvin main he, or aapke rishtedaaron kaa betaa dasvin main he, to aapkaa man hameshaa is baat ko campare karata rahata he ki meraa betaa unase aage janaa chahie, aapke dost ke bete se aage hona chahie
 Just what is in your mind, it causes pressure on your son

 NDTV co-founder and co-chairman Dr Prannoy Roy was today conferred with the prestigious Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award - 2015 for excellence in public administration, academia and management
 dilli main yojit samaaroh main unhone yah bhaashan diya
 i feel honored by receiving this very prestigious award - thank you very much
 mujhe enditivi ke sabhi logon or bhartiya media ke pratinidhi ke taur par yahaan khadaa hokar garv ho rahaa he
 India has the world's most vibrant, questioning and fearless media
 yah kuch aisa he, jis par ham sabhi ko behad garv hona chahie
 As a soft power of the world, it is more important to win the hearts and minds of the people than guns and weapons hardware and one day the Indian media will play a very important global role for our country
 yah puraskaar paakar main behad abhibhoot hum, kyonki yah sabase prakhar buddhi vaali hastiyon se bhare foundation dwaara chunaa jaataa he, jinhone pehle hi mujhase saaf kar diya tha ki yah koi raajnneetik award nahin he
 This is very important for the freedom of the journalist, because i firmly believe that the more important the judiciary is to stay away from the government, the more important is the separation of journalists from leaders
 patrakaron kii netaaon se kareebi is peshey main ek asahaj pravriti he; netaa prakruti se hi aakarshak log hote hai, or duniya bhar main patrakaron ko chetaya jaataa he ki ve netaaon ke aakarshan or shakti main bahakein yaa unamem fansen nahin, kyonki yah unke kaam - nishpaksh reporting ko - behad mushkil bana degaa
 At a broader level of segregation, the last few decades have seen three major changes in the relationship between government and television in India, and in NDTV we have learned and progressed from each of these stages - indeed our history with each of them joined
 pehla : teen dashak pehle, yah 'bahishkaar se niyantran' kaa daur tha
 Television journalists, who were not part of the government media - were not 'embedded', they were cut off from the nation - had no right to news on their own country India, no right to practice their profession
 yah vah daur tha, jab enditivi ne televijan par khabar dikhaane vaala pehali gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan banakar simaaon ko aage badhaane kii koshish kii
 However, then it was allowed to show not only the country but also international news, so we started 'the World This Week'
 ek baar sthapit hone, or apane darshakon se mili samarthan ke saath, ham bharat par khabar dikhaane vaale pehle gaiyr-sarkari televijan media banane kii raah par chal die - or uske baad bharat main sabase pehle 24-ghante chalane vaala samachar channel launch kiya
 When the phase of 'boycott-to-control' came to an end, then the second round came from 'threat to Control' - this was a period in which leaders would call journalists and warn them of dire consequences if they did not make the desired changes in the news
 
 hakeekat main, koi bhi in dhamkiyon kii parvaah nahin karata tha or bharat ke patrakaron kii iske liye tarif kerani chahie
 The strategy of journalists used to be quite simple - listen, do nothing and then it will end itself
 mujhe aisa hi ek khaas dhamkee bharaa phone kol yaad he : "aap jaanate hai ki main aap ek sachcha samarthak rahaa hum, lekin agar isi tarah kaa kaam karte rahen, to kuch nahin kar paaungaa
 Others will force me to close your company
 kripaya apni in reporton ko band karen
 ' in phone colls ke saath jaisaa hameshaa se hota aayaa he, maine bilkul kuch bhi nahin kiya
 We made sure that phone reporting or threats to journalists reporting in the field were not detected
 hamaari reporting main kuch bhi nahin badla
 a few hours later, i again received a phone call from the same leader, in which he told me, 'thank you very much for changing your news!' i did not say anything
 yah daur kareeb 10 saal pehle tak chalaa
 Then the leaders simply gave up trying
 koi or phone kol nahin
 And believe me, we never miss those phone calls! haalanki, phir iske baad ek nayaa daur shuru hua, niyantran ke adhik sookshm or phone kol kii tulana main shaayad adhik ghaatak tareekon ke saath
 The third round was of 'control using the technique of Meccarthism'
 mekkarthism vyapak rup se sanyukt rajya america ke haalia itihaas kii sabase kaali avadhi mana jaataa he
 In this era, government departments like the FBI and the tax department used to file false cases against almost every well-known journalist and hundreds of influential people in Hollywood
 yah vah daur tha, jab america ko 'har jagah communist' (red under evari bed) dikhataa tha
 This trend, which started 10 years ago - now in India, we have started seeing anti-nationals and anti-nationals everywhere
 yah teesraa daur bhi baaki donon kii tarah hi biit jayega
 Till then, our full support and sympathy is with all our journalists across the country who are being beaten and jailed without any crime, just for their fearless reporting
 mujhe vishwaas he ki yah daur bhi biit jayega, kyonki bharat kaa media har baar rajya ke niyantran se ladaa he; har baar, yah mukt or ladaai se pehle kii tulana main or majboot hokar ubhara he
 If i have to give a message to the leaders and governments of all the parties, it is this - do not crush India's media, but develop, because for the people of this country, our media is one of our biggest assets
 bharat kaa media jald hi ek din sienen or bibisi ko dikhayega ki vastav main bina kisi seemaa ke ek jeevant or nishpaksh bahes kisi hoti he
 Keep an eye on it - look at the media in India - you haven't seen anything yet

 Meanwhile, India Today Group Editorial Director Raj Chengappa in his address highlighted the importance of Rachna Utsav and described its success as a shared result of the India Today team's hard work

 arun kumaar sharma (puraatatv), mirza masood (rangakarm) or rahul singh (vishay visheshgy-samskruti or puraatatv)—ko india today samskruti sammaan pradaan kiya

 Bal Sulabh Kautuk was also such that can he also read any of his works from this forum! How the time spent for about five and a half hours was not known
 chhattisgarh cinema ke abhinayta man kuraishi or abhinetri anukriti chouhan ko bhi is bich manch par aamantrit kiya gaya
 Needless to say, it was a celebration for the confluence of creation and creativity

 uttar pradesh ke sonbhadra main buudhvaar ko jamini ranjish ko lekar hue aapasi vivaad main jamkar khooni sangharsh hua
 10 people died in this incident
 ghayalon ko aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he jisamen kuch kii sthiti gambhir bani hui he
 The incident is of Umbha, the village of Gram Sabha Murthia
 yahaan ke pradhan ne do saal pehle vahiin par lagbhag 100 bighas jameen kharidi jis par apane samarthakon ke saath kabja karne gaya tha
 The locals opposed it
 iske baad bavaal ho gaya
 It killed 10 people, including 3 women
 sthaneey logon kii maane to vivaad ke dauraan aapas main asalhe se firing or gadasa chalane se kai log gambhir rup se ghayal ho gaye
 According to the villagers, there was a land dispute between the principal and the other side of the village
 buudhvaar kii dopaher jameen vivaad ko lekar bahes shuru hui jisane khooni sangharsh kaa rup le liya
 On seeing the corpses were laid in the field
 maamla gram pradhan ke 100 bighas jameen kaa hi nahin he
 Seeing the whole matter, the dispute here was mainly between two castes for a long time
 teesraa paksh yahaan kaa rajasav vibhaag he jise kai varshon se is vivaad kii jaankaree thi lekin ankhen moond kar maano isi din kaa intjaar ho rahaa ho
 The dispute of 200 bighas of land in Umbha village has been going on for a long time
 is jameen par kabje ko lekar gurjar (bhurtiya) or god birdari ke log gaahe-bagaahe aamane saamne aate rahe hai
 Till now the matter was settled by middle rescue but this did not happen on Wednesday and the fight between the two castes took violent form
 is vivaad ke centre main umbha kaa pradhan mukhya rup se shaamil he jiske log buudhvaar ko asalhon ke saath khet par kabja karne gaye the
 Pradhan's name is Yajnadatta Singh
 pichley saal yajyadutt ne apane or gharavaalon ke naam lagbhag 100 bighas jameen kii registry karai thi
 On Wednesday, when his convoy turned towards the fields, he was focused on plowing 200 bighas of land
 iske virodh main god jati ke log kheton main dat gaye or maamla khooni sangharsh main tabdeel ho gaya
 It is reported in media reports that Yajnadatta Singh reached the disputed field with 30–32 trolleys at around 11 pm on Wednesday
 uske saath do sau gurjar birdari ke log the
 These people started plowing on disputed land
 isaki jaankaree god birdari ke logon ko mili to unhone virodh karnaa shuru kar diya
 As soon as the incident came to light, some people of the God community had gathered in the fields, but as the conflict increased, they gathered more
 donon paksh ke log aamane saamne aa gaye or hinsa bad gai
 The buzz is that the Gurjars carried out the attacks with disguise and greed while the people of the God caste continued to pelt stones and lathi poles rained on the opponents
 dekhte dekhte khet kii jameen khun se rang gai or chaaron or cheekh pukaar much gai
 The sports department of Revenue Department and Society, besides Gurjar, has two sides whose game spoiled the whole affair
 media main aisi charchaa he ki umbha gaanv main 600 bigha jameen adarsh kooparative socity ke naam he
 However the registration of this society ended in 1973 itself
 tab se kheton kaa itnaa bada hissaa ek tarah se vivaad main tha ki isaki milkiyat kiske naam he
 On the one hand, people of God community say that for a long time they used to cultivate these fields and used to cultivate
 duusari taraf gurjar or gram pradhan yajyadutt ke pakshakaron kaa kahana he ki unhone jameen kharidi isliye kanuunan jutai kaa adhikaar unheen kaa banataa he
 In such a situation, the question arises that when the Revenue Department knew that there was a dispute over such a large part of the land, why did it not inform the administration or take precautionary measures? The link of Adarsh cooperative Society is joining an IAS
 khabaron ke mutabik 1989 main isi jameen (kul 600 bigha) main se 100-100 bigha jameen iees adhikari, uski patni or beti ke naam kar di gai
 The other side is that of Yajnadatta Singh, who bought about 100 bighas of land in his name
 teesraa paksh god jatiyon kaa he jo kaaphi pehle se is par jutai karte the or apni milkiyat kaa daawa karte the
 Due to the dispute of the three parties, the matter had gone to court and the case was also going on
 maamla abhi esadm ke yahaan lambit he
 The question is, when such a big controversy was in front and so many people were involved in it, then why did the administration continue to lax in its action? uttarakhandamen bukamp ke jatke mahusas kiye gaye hai

 Film: Andhadhuni Director: Sriram Raghavan Artist: Ayushman Khurana, Tabu, Radhika Apte, Anil Dhawan Time period: 2 hours 20 minutes Certificates: UA Stars: 4 Sriram Raghavan is known for making a different kind of cinema
 yahi kaaran he ki unhone ab tak sirf paanch filmein nirdeshit kii hai
 Including Badlapur, Ek Hasina, Agent Vinod and now a thriller film named "andhadhun"
 shriram hameshaa se hi badhiya kahani sunaane ke liye jane jate hai
 This time too, since the trailer of Andhadhun has arrived, the audience watching such a film has a different enthusiasm in its heart
 wo ise dekhne ke liye aatur bhi hai
 What is the story of the film, how is the film made, let's review
 
 
 
 What is the story of the film: The story of the film is of a piano player (ayushmann Khurrana), who is blind
 wo apni garlfrendradhika apteke restaurant main piano bajaakar guzaara karata he
 At the same time, on the other hand, there are tabu who have to marry a star (anil Dhawan) to become rich
 baad main wo ek amir patni bhi kahalaai jaati hai
 Everything is going fine, meanwhile, one day suddenly Anil Dhawan dies
 anil kii maut ek murder mistry ban jaati he
 The attack also appears on Ayushman Khurana
 haalanki wo andhaa he
 So how could he have seen this murder, or could he not be an eyewitness due to blindness
 yaheen se kahani ek alag mode lene lagati he
 There are lots of twists and turns
 aakhirkaar kya hota he, qatl kisne kiya he or koun he sabase bada doshi, ye sabakuch jaanane ke liye film dekhni padegi
 Why watch the film? As soon as Shri Ram Raghavan's name comes, the audience becomes a part of a different kind of film
 aisi film jisamen har ek pal kuch nayaa hone vaala he
 It is the same in Andhadhun
 bahut saare twist or terns aate hai
 In the 10th minute, what you are thinking does not happen, something becomes different
 screen play damdaar he
 The story is very powerful
 jis tareeke se shriram ne ise sunaaya he wo flavor bahut hi alag or umdaa hai

 The administration has said that other qualified retired teachers who have missed becoming Emeritus will now be given a chance by the new rules
 vahiin jeenyu shikshak sangh ne sivi maangane ko hi apmaan kaha he
 The administration has said that unilateral opinion is being spread in many newspapers and social media about the Professor Emeritus case at JNU
 ye prashasnic riforms ko badnaam karne ke uddeshy se kiya ja rahaa he
 This decision is based on statutory and ordinances by the administration
 pichley saal, jeenyu kaaryakari parishad dwaara ek aisa kadam uthaaya gaya tha, jisamen vishvavidhyalay ke sarvocch sanvidhik nikaay jeenyu ke baahar ke dean, cheirperson or prasiddh shikshavid shaamil the

 In this case, the registrar has said that at present, JNU has 21 emeritus professors

 Referring to the new academic rules and regulations 32 of the university, it said that under it, professors who have attained the age of 75 years have been requested to state their contributions so that a committee constituted to review the situation may look into it
 prashasan ne kaha ki har koi kanoon ke samaksh samaan he, sabhi 12 ameritas prophessoron ko patr bheje gaye the, jinhone vishvavidhyalay kii shaikshanik gatividhiyon main bhaag lene ke liye unki uplabdhta or ichha ko jaanane ke liye 75 varsh kii aayu praapt kii he
 But an expedition was carried out using only the name of an emeritus professor
 jeenyu prashasan doharaata he ki kisi bhi emirates professor ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya gaya he, jaisaa ki jhootha aarope lagaaya gaya he
 It has only sought to implement a rule which is part of the university's ordinance
 CV maangana hi apmaan: jeenyu shikshak sanghajeenyu shikshak sangh ke adhyaksh pro atul sood ne kaha ki JNU prashasan ne pehle din kaha ki ham keval jaankaree jamaa kar rahe hai, na ham hataanaa chaahate hai keval ham unki awelibty or willingness jaananaa chaah rahe hai
 However, it was written about the letter that information is being sought to decide about the continuation
 professor sood ne kaha ki emrtis kaa chayan kisi ke professorship ke dauraan uske kaam ke aadhaar par hota he
 They do not give cvs to the university, but the university invites them on the basis of their work
 ab sawaal ye he ki jab unhen emrtis banane ke samay par sivi nahin maanga gaya to ab si aadhaar par sivi maanga gaya
 Prof Sood said that the university can make whatever rules it wants to make in future by the university body, but those which were made by the old Vice Chancellor cannot be changed

 The attack on the Syrian airbase is believed to be the result of the same

 After this, speculation was rife that the US could back out of the strategy of ousting the Assad government, but after the chemical attacks, Trump said that the incident made him think again

 In the Obama era, America has been considered a supporter of the rebels fighting against the Assad government

 Bollywood star Hrithik Roshan may do less films, but his films have generally performed well at the box office
 unki pichhali chaar filmein 'zindagi na milegi dobaaraa', 'agnipath', 'krish 3' or 'baing baing' na keval alag-alag johnor kii filmein thim, balki darshakon ne bhi sabhi ko pasand kiya
 This is the reason that someone has now agreed to give them Rs 550 crore in exchange for satellite rights for his next six films
 ruthik ne deal sin kar lee he, or yah agle saal, yani 2017 se lagu hogi
 The comments agle saal ruthik roshan kii 'kaabil' pradarshit hone ja rahi he, jiske satellite rhite pehle hi 45 karod rupee main beche ja chuke hai
 But now this new deal has proved that Hrithik is very strong box office stars
 gauratlab he ki is nai deal se ruthik ne box offis ke sabase majboot star salmaan ko bhi peeche chhod diya he, kyonki salmaan khan ko isi tarah kii deal ke liye 500 karod rupee mili
 By the way, Ajay Devgan and Varun Dhawan have also done similar deals, of which Varun Dhawan is reported to have given Rs 300 crore
 yahi kaaran he ki unki agali chah filmon ke satellite rhite ke badale ab unhen 550 karod rupee dene ke liye koi taiyaar ho gaya he
 Hrithik has signed the deal, and it will come into effect from next year i
e
 2017
 tippaniyan Hrithik Roshan's 'kaabil' is going to be released next year, whose satellite rights have already been sold for Rs 45 crore
 lekin ab is nai deal ne sabit kiya he ki ruthik box offis ke behad majboot sitare hai
 Significantly, this new deal has also left Hrithik behind the strongest box office star Salman, as Salman Khan got Rs 500 crores for a similar deal
 vaise, ajay devgan or varun dhawan bhi is tarah kii deal kar chuke hai, jinamein se varun dhawan ko 300 karod rupee die jane kii khabar he

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has once again attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for giving Delhi full statehood
 unhone (arvind Kejriwal) buudhvaar ko apni is maang ko lekar ek twit bhi kiya
 Arvind Kejriwal wrote that Atal ji had brought bills in Parliament to make Delhi a full state
 bhaajapa atal ji kii asthiyon ko desh bhar main ghumaakar vot maang rahi he par atal ji ke adhure sapane ko puraa nahin karnaa chaahati
 The special thing is that Arvind Kejriwal made this tweet in response to a tweet by BJP leader and Union Minister Vijay Goel in which he wrote that neither Mamata Banerjee ever raised the issue of full statehood in Parliament, nor twenty Sometime in the year, he supported the complete state of Delhi
 jin vipaksh dalon ke saath kejariwal haath khadey karte hue dikhte hai vah pehle un netaaon se to purna rajya par samarthan kii baat kahalava de
 Atal ji brought bills in Parliament to make Delhi a full state
 bhaajapa atal ji kii asthiyon ko desh bhar main ghumaakar vot maang rahi he par atal ji ke adhure sapane ko puraa nahin karnaa chaahati

 He wrote in his tweet that after the Delhi High Court's decision, in the last one week many private schools in Delhi had increased the fees
 hajaaron rupee ke arier maang rahe the
 There was a lot of fury in parents

 He then tweeted another

 i want to assure all the parents that now you have your own government, honest government in Delhi
 har haalat main aapaki or aapke hiton kii raksha karegi
 Today, if there was a dishonest government, it would have never appealed to the court after eating money from schools
 main sabhi perants ko aashwaasan dena chahta hoon ki ab dilli main aapaki apni sarkaar he, eemaandaar sarkaar he

 co / bfnsttougk It is noteworthy that Arvind Kejriwal had earlier said that every family will be provided a home in affordable and easy installments within ten years if Delhi has full government
 arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne pashchimi dilli sansadeey kshetra ke janakapuri main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte huye kaha thaki 70 saal pehle dilli vikaas praadhikaran (didie) bana tha
 DDA is under central government
 didie kaa kaam tha dilli ke prayek parivaar ko sasti or aasaan kishton main ghar bana kar dena
 The DDA, instead of building the house to the people, just cut the plot and gave it to the builders
 didie bhrashtachar kaa adda ban gaya he
 "arvind Kejriwal had said that Delhi would become a full-fledged state and within ten years would house every family in Delhi on affordable and easy installments
 arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne kaha tha ki vah iske liye puri taiyaari karke aaye hai isiliye is vaade ke puraa karne ke liye das saal kaa samay maanga he
 He had said that when this happens, all the landlords in Delhi will be no tenants
 arvind kejariwal (arvind Kejriwal) ne kaha tha ki dilli ko purna rajya kaa darja milane par bahut aise kaam honge jo purna rajya nahin hone ke kaaran nahin ho paa rahe hai
 Kejriwal had said that in the last election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said at the Ramlila Maidan rally that Delhi would be made a full state if all seven seats go to the bjp's account
 unhone kaha ki is chunaav main ab modi se ham puch rahe hai ki paanch saal ho gayi, purna rajya kaa vaada puraa karne ke bajaay ab vah is vaade se hi mukar gayi hai
 In the capital Lucknow, a drama that shook the rape incidents was staged

 a video of Delhi T20 is going viral in which Bangladeshi fan is seen roaring in front of Sachin Tendulkar fan Sudhir Kumar Gautam
 uskaa jawaab sudhir gajab andaaj main de rahe hai
 This video is becoming quite viral on tiktok
 video main dekha ja saktaa he ki ek bangladeshi fain sudhir ke kareeb aata he or bangladesh jindaabaaj ke naare lagane lagata he
 On which Sudhir chants 'bangladesh will lose'
 jis par bangladeshi fain sher kii tarah dahaad maarane lagata he to sudhir usko ghurkar dekhne lagate hai
 This video is being well liked

 This is flight IC-415 from New Delhi to Patna, and the talk is on 21 August
 is udaan main bihar kii raajnneeti ke do diggaj nitish kumaar or lalu prasad yadav savaar hai
 Suddenly the aircraft started buzzing
 donon kis tarah ek-duusare kaa abhivadan karenge? dabi jabaan main baaten ho rahi thim
 When Lalu arrived on the plane at six thirty in the evening, Nitish Kumar, sitting on the 1A seat of business class, thought it better to go into the sleep of 'sleep'
 rajd pramukh ne bhi nitish ko lekar puri tarah udaseenta bharaa rukh apanaaya or ve seat kii quality ko lekar chaalak dal ke sadasyon se ulajhate dikhe
 During this journey of 80 minutes, both were sitting in the front seat but there was no talk between them
 sambhawatah isse donon ke bich kii talkhi kii gaharaai jaahir hoti he
 Today, similar sentiments are seen prominently in the electoral landscape of Bihar
 bihar main 21 aktubar se vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, aise main lalu prasad jo november 2005 se satta se nirvaasan jhel rahe hai, patliputra kii satta ko apane kabje main lene kii har sambhav koshish kar rahe hai jabaki ek shaks unki raah kaa roda bana hua he, or ve nitish kumaar hai
 Similarly, it is Lalu and only Lalu who can deprive Nitish of enjoying power once again
 lalu trephic kii us gaay kii tarah hai, jo nitish ke vaahan ke kahin pahunchane main deree kar sakati he or use palat bhi sakati he
 It is no wonder that there are no rules of their enmity
 ab chunaavon ke sir par hone ke chalate lalu or nitish ek-duusare ko gujarey jamaane kii cheez banane par utaaru hai
 The electoral atmosphere in Bihar is completely hot
 jahaan nitish kumaar kah rahe hai, ''log umr chhipaane ke liye apane bal rang rahe hai'', vahiin lalu ne bhi yah aarope lagaakar aag ugali ki bihar ke mukhyamantri apane chehre kii 'dinting or painting' kar rahe hai
 During the elections, another topic which is going to be prominent in the verbal war is that of change
 rajya ke 243 vidhansabha kshetron main 5
 With more than 44 crore voters, it is inevitable that personalities will dominate the issues in the intense election of Bihar Assembly
 vaise, bihar aaj bhi puraani samasyaon se grast he- prati vyakti aay ke maamle main rajya sabase neeche he, 55 fisadi se adhik aabaadi garibi rekha se neeche rahati he, stri-purush anupaat rashtriya ausat se bahut kam he, prati vyakti vidyut upbhog ke maamle main bhi rajya bahut peeche he
 Apart from this, many problems also exist
 vidambnaa yah he ki in chunaavon ko behad ahm mana ja rahaa he kyonki is baar bahut kuch daanv par laga hua he
 Nitish Kumar, Lalu in these elections; And Ram Vilas Paswan is fighting the most important battle of his political life
 jaahir he ki ek kaa nuksaan hone se duusare ko phayda milegaa
 If Lalu and Paswan fail to make a comeback, they should be prepared for their departure
 agar nitish asafal rahe to ve is baat kaa taaja or sabase vidambnaatmak udhaaharan honge ki kis tarah se acchhee shuruyaat kaa phayda ve na le sake
 Lalu and Paswan are past sixty, so the 2010 assembly elections are probably the best and last chance for them to overthrow the NDA
 udhar, 59 saal kii umr main nitish kumaar rashtriya maanchitr par apni taaja chhap chhodane kii dahalij par hai
 Nitish Kumar, popularly known as a heavyweight for veterans, will be in the line of big national leaders if he gets a second chance
 agar ve haar gaye to unhen shaayad doosraa mauka na mil sakegaa
 Lalu and Paswan are working day and night to sway Nitish in the anti-incumbency wave
 duusari ore, nitish apane raajnneetik hchhatidwandvinyon ke paramparaagat vot bank main send lagane kii nirantar koshish main jute hai
 On the other hand, the Congress is engaged in a triangular contest in the state with the help of Rahul Gandhi
 dilachasp baat to yah he ki bihar ke chunaav haalanki aksar nijee karishme ke bal par lade jate hai, lekin is baar badi hastiyon ne chunaav nahin ladane kaa man banaaya he
 Nitish Kumar has said that he has no need to contest the assembly elections
 isi tarah, rajd-lojpa ke mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar lalu prasad kii bhi chunaav ladane kii sambhaavna kam hi najar aati he
 Apart from this, Rajya Sabha MP Ram Vilas Paswan and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who are facing the brunt of not opening LJP account in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, which is the key to maintaining the JD (U) -BJP alliance in the state, will also not contest
 yah bihar kii vyaktitv aadhaarit raajnneeti se mail nahin khaataa he
 But the dual responsibilities of strategizing and promoting do not give them the freedom to focus on one seat at all
 do dashak pehle, mandal lahar lalu ko majboot sthiti main le ai thi
 Since then, the RJD has been slowly but surely losing its strong support base to rivals
 aaj, lalu usee itihaas ko dohraane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Lalu, who began his first term as Chief Minister of Bihar on March 10, 1990, is taking a reversal in the desert of time
 aaj 20 saal baad, ateet kaa yah safar hi unhen ujjwal bhavishya kii ore le ja saktaa he
 Lalu has also been generous in making compromises, bowing to the hope of victory
 ve prabhunath singh jaise kattar aalochak ko bhi apane saath le aae hai
 He has given 75 seats to Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) to prevent anti-nitish votes being cut
 unhen paswan ke saath na hone kaa khamiyaja aktubar 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhugatna padaa tha
 Recently, when senior upper caste leader Akhilesh Singh appeared more inclined towards the Congress, Lalu arrived at his residence for dinner to improve relations
 unhone savarnon ko lubhaane ke liye unke bich aarthik rup se kamjor logon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene kaa vaada bhi kiya he
 They are the same Savarnas who look at the 15-year RJD rule with disgust
 is baar lalu un jaateey samoohon ko lubhaane main safal bhi ho sakate hai, jo nitish ke pichde virgon or mahadaliton ke prati atyadhik anuraag se khafa hai
 In fact, the 2010 assembly elections are the first time since the 90s when 16 per cent of the upper caste votes in Bihar are being counted
 aisa isliye he ki pichde varg kaa janaadhar bant kar rah gaya he
 Both Lalu and Paswan are engaged in fighting ethnic arithmetic about Muslims, Yadavs, Dalits and upper castes who have been disillusioned
 lalu kii hameshaa se apane matadaataaon ke saath behtareen jugalbandi rahi he
 But they know that unless caste mathematics is correct, all of this will be of no use
 iske alaava, unka focus un kuch siton par bhi he jo rajd ne 2005 main bahut hi kam antaraal se ganvaa di thim
 This time Lalu is also talking about changing the face of Bihar
 ve vaada kar rahe hai ki ve bihar ko usee tarah badalakar rakh denge jaise unhone bhartiya rail ko badla he
 But looking at his record as the Chief Minister of Bihar, he does not seem to get much appreciation
 iske alaava rajd pramukh ke liye nitish kii nattejey dene vaale mukhyamantri kii 'chhavi' kii kaat dhundhna baari pad rahaa he
 Nitish Kumar is also aware that his 'special influence' has decreased after the Lok Sabha elections in which the NDA won 32 out of 40 seats
 us samay rajya kii 243 vidhansabha siton main se 176 par jad (you) or bhaajapa ummidavaaron ne badhat darj kii thi jabaki rajd sirf 33 siton par hi badhat bana sakaa tha
 By the way, the NDA lost 13 seats in the by-elections held in 18 assembly seats in September 2009
 lekin nitish ke tarkash main ab bhi kai tir bache hai
 He worked on a dual strategy
 unhone seemaant samoohon ke saamaajik kalyaan ko dhyaan main rakhkar vikaas ko anjaam diya
 During his entire tenure, he kept building a new social base very passionately
 unhone paaramparik saamaajik guton se alag jati or samudaay aadhaarit nae gathbandhan kaa nirmaan kiya
 Nitish is now cashing in on a 'coalition of opposing factions' for his own benefit, ranging from upper caste to highly backward and Mahadalit
 sangharsh karne vaale ek dharmanirpeksh kii unki chhavi or alpsankhyakon ko dhyaan main rakhkar uthaae gaye unke kadamon se unhen samarthan kaa nayaa aadhaar mila he
 Now that the elections are over, everything is not easy for Nitish
 raashtrapati chunaav kii tarah prachaar ko anjaam de rahe nitish ne beshak kuch nae dost banaae hai, par is prakriya main kuch bharosemand dost khoe bhi hai
 His most trusted lieutenants are Prabhunath Singh and Lalan Singh in the anti-camp camp
 rajya main nitish kii swakaryata dar ab bhi oonchi he
 Yet there is a danger for Nitish
 unki uplabdhiyon kaa badha-chadhaakar kiya jane vaala prachaar jo jamini hakeekat se bilkul bhi mail nahin khaataa he
 With this, they can easily get caught in the web of 'bihar Uday'
 unke shashan ko lekar baari gungan bhi unki chhavi ko dhakka pahunchaa saktaa he
 Their troubles do not end here
 unki sahyogi bhagava party ke kuch avyav nitish kii aakraamak dharmanirpekshata ke viruddh mook virodh jataate rahe hai
 This may perhaps make the bjp's core cadre indifferent to the NDA in those seats where JD (U) candidates stand
 ayodhya par faisla-jisaki is maheene aane kii sambhaavna he-chaahe jo ho, bhaajapa use apane mul matadaataaon ke samaksh bhunaane kii koshish kar sakati he, lekin iskaa jad (you) ke saath uske gathbandhan par ulataa asar ho saktaa he or nitish is masale par kaui rukh apnaane se inkaar kar sakate hai
 In fact, the latest rift in the alliance was seen on Monday when JD (U) leaders demanded an end to all relations with the BJP
 unhone yah maang bhaajapa netaa mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ke is bayaan par kii ki narendra modi bihar main prachaar karenge
 But now both parties seem to be trying to crack the matter as it is not the right time to highlight any split in the alliance
 agar kuch or nahin to is baat se kam-se-kam ek baar phir yah ishaara mil jaataa he ki bhaajapa bihar main nitish kii sahyogi kii bhoomika nibhaa rahi he
 a party that is in power in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand has become a subordinate party in Bihar
 aisa isliye bhi mana ja rahaa he ki kendriya netritv ateet main kai sahyogiyon ko kho chukaa he or vah bihar ke mukhyamantri ko bataur sahyogi nahin khona chahta
 This alliance reached the verge of collapse when Nitish canceled a dinner for Narendra Modi and BJP National Executive leaders in June this year and also returned flood relief material sent by Gujarat to Bihar
 was
 lekin bhaajapa abhi tak unke aage jhukati aa rahi he
 For Nitish, the troubles arising out of natural calamities - droughts and floods - apart from some obvious failures are also exposed in one stroke
 garibi rekha se neeche rahane vaale logon kii sankhya bahut zyada he, rajya bijli ke liye centre par nirbhar he, udyogikaran ke naam par bhi zyada kuch aakaar nahin le sakaa he or berogari kaa dard ab bhi logon ko salata he
 The increase in their woes is due to four recently hijacked policemen by the Maoists, which led to the eclipse of the state's success in the field of law and order
 udhar, congress trishanku vidhansabha kii ummid lagaae baithi he
 It aims to increase its current figure of 10 seats by four times; So that it can make some big upsets
 yah bihar main rahul gandhi ke liye ek tarah kii agnipariksha he
 After all, this election battle is going to be Lalu against Nitish
 nitish kii soshal surgery kaa muqabla lalu-paswan ke vot aadhaar se hoga
 The two leaders have conflicting skills and alliances, but are driven by the same philosophy and common ambition
 baharhaal, donon jis lakshya kaa sapana dekh rahe hai, usamen do vyakti ek saath nahin samaa sakate
 On 26 May 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the charge of the Railway Ministry, giving the status of Cabinet Minister in his government to Sadananda Gowda, former Chief Minister of Karnataka

 2006 main gauda ko karnataka bijepi adhyaksh banaaya gaya
 As Chief Minister, Gowda worked to strengthen the image of the party which was clouded by corruption
 apane kaarykaal ke dauraan unhone tay samaysima ke bheetar sarkari daftaron main kaam nipataane par jor diya
 But Gowda could not continue in this post for long as he could not manage to keep the various factions of the party united after Yeddyurappa's withdrawal
 july 2012 main unhen mukhyamantri pad se hatane ko kaha gaya or unki jagah par jagadish shettar ko gaddi saunpi gai
 However, after the defeat in the assembly elections in May 2013, Sadanand Gowda was re-elected by the BJP as its Leader of Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly
