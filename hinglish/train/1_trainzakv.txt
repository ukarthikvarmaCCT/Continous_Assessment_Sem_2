 Perhaps one or two have been encouraged that they do not run in any lower class
 par nigahen mujhe maarane lageen 
 Started staring
 laga ki unki aankhon se laal leisure kirane nikal rahi hai jo meri kamai or haisiyat ko scan kar rahi hai 
 i felt that i was hiding under the sofa after saving my torn shoes in a rich family's best
 emirates ke jahaaz bahut khubasurat hote hai or uske log behad achche 
 a prince of the ship, which looked like a leader, jumped up
 jaise hi ahsaas hua ki wo mujhe iconomi class main dekh rahaa he apane aap main simat gaya 
 Hey sir! You here! Wait i do something meri khatiradaari kii khaatir baichaiyn ho gaya 
 i would have said that if i had seen the business class, the chairs were empty there, it would have made me sit
 par mere chup rah jane se or machal gaya 
 Sir, i try nahin main yahan thik hoon 
 There is an edge seat and had kept the long leg apart from the body on the way to walk
 par wo kai baar aayaa 
 "there is no problem"
 chupake se ek tohafaa bhi de gaya 
 "sir, we will get you upgraded from next time" Sir, we want you very much
 to raveesh babu ko apgrade hona baaki he ! jo log bijnes class or iconomi class kaa fark nahin jaanate unhen bataa don ki hawaii jahaaz main do tarah kii kursiyaan hoti hai 
 An economy class chair is like a bench
 bahut sankuchit or takalifdeh 
 In business class, you can move around like a resting chair in the verandah of landlords
 iconomi class main maine logo ke tede ho jane kii kshamta se gazab kaa prabhavit hua hoon 
 One should study how people can grow taller in less space
 bahut saal pehle landan gaya tha 
 From the British High Commission
 hamen british airways ke bijnes class main bithaaya gaya 
 We sat down just as it sits in the economy
 seat ko lamrana ( bhojpuri shabd) yani khol kar lanbaa karnaa aayaa hi nahin 
 When Nidhi Razdan, who was walking along, saw why it is sitting on air
 paas aakar dhire se poocha tum aaraam se kyon nahin let jate 
 Lie down? Nidhi laughed at me and pressed some buttons and the chair opened
 apan to laaj ke maare mar gaye 
 Nidhi did not pass any Judgment
 shukriya ji 
 So well ab neuyark se dilli lautne kii baari thi 
 At Kennedy Airport, people started talking as if the man would not be found on board
 unhen yaqiin tha ki bijnes class main jaakar unase alag ho jayega 
 As soon as he reached the economy class with him, the same people who were talking were shocked
 aap bijnes class main nahin chal rahe ? are aapke saath chal rahe hai ye kya kam he 
 At one point, i started talking to Air India colleagues that somehow i get a business class
 mere liye kuch na kar paane kaa afsos unke chehre par tairne laga 
 All the ship's colleagues were excited to see me
 iconomi class main mujhe dekhakar unhen bhi niraashaa hui hogi
 Not a single seat in the ship was empty
 is baar agar ve bijnes class main bitha dete to main manaa nahin karata
 The waist problem was not tolerated
 yahi soch kar yatra kar gaya ki pehali baar or aakiri baar america ja rahaa hoon kya fark padataa he
 Standing goes away
 raste bhar iconomi class kii takaleef bhi jhelo or logon kii nigahon se ghayal bhi hote raho ki ye to fatichar niklaa
 Runs in economy
 class kii aisi bhayaavah krurta bahut dinon baad jheli he
 An Air India staff said that my entire family is your fan
 ek selfi chahie
 "let's go to business class
 "yahan bahut log dekhenge
 We said that hey where we have sat, there is class
 jahaan ham nahin he vahaan koi class nahin he
 He also went to Sharma through Shatradhan Sinha type dialogue
 kair selfi ho gai
 All the staff of Air India were good
 payalat ne khub aadar se haath milaayaa or sammaan diya
 The staff of Air India is no less than anyone in less convenience
 laga ki hawa main bharat chal rahaa he
 The wife of a Gujarati brother going to Ahmedabad after packing the goods from America sent Menthi's paratha
 dil se shukriya
 More than his trouble, his pregnant wife only cared
 ek bihari bhai mili jo musalamaanon ke bare main purvaagrah paal paal kar pagal ho chuke the
 The only achievement of his arguments was that since he lives in America, everything should be accepted as correct
 maine bol hi diya ki bhai ji main america ko hi bhav nahin detaa, to aapako america kaa naam lekar kapaar par kaise baith jane don
 The conversation continued
 ham jane kitne mulkon ke upar se udate hue vahi bane rahe jo hai
 Dirt kept spreading
 seat bhi todate rahe
 Understanding this, Air India belongs to its father
 emirates main sabko aise baithe dekha jaise ve glassgo se training lekar aae hon ki jahaaz main kaise baitha jaataa he
 Kept thinking about one thing logon ko mujhe iconomi main dekhakar kyon hairaani hui ? kaayade se unhen ye poochna chahie tha ki patrkaar bhi bijnes class main chalata he? apana alag se bijnes karata he yaa vaaqai uski kamai itani hi he
 First of all, people should have knocked on seeing the journalist in the business class, and in reverse economy class, they had to put the bed of their doubts under my seat
 kuch patrkaar bilkul apni kamai se bijnes class main chal sakate hai lekin agar aap sabase ye ummid karte hai to aap apana mental class check kar lijiye
 i face this class attack everyday in domestic flights
 log company kaa munaafaa or meraa darmaha ( vetan) poochne lagate hai
 Bhai is a third class named Ravish Kumar
 kush rahiye na ki safar main ham saath hai

 Love you now forever and always Have a great day darling ! a post shared by Soni Razdan (@sonirazdan) on Sep 19, 2017 at 8:19pm PDT Indian Army Chief General VK Singh, who visited Nepal, has described the news published in an English daily on Wednesday as stating that two important troops of the army were dangerous without the knowledge of the government on the night of 16 and 17 January
 The manner had moved towards Delhi, which made the government nervous

 He said that such reports are an attempt to malign the army and the government and action should be taken against such people
 tippaniyan It is noteworthy that after this news published in the Indian Express, there was a stir in the politics of the country on Wednesday, and both the army and the government had denied the news yesterday

 General Singh, who arrived in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal on a two-day visit, reacted to the news published on the front page of the English daily Indian Express on Wednesday while speaking to reporters after meeting with the then President Rambaran Yadav
 It is also wrong that the army had a coup or rebellion

 Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu once again seems to be stuck with his statement
 somvaar kofimaki kheti ko lekar die gaye unke bayaan ke baadapunjabamein raajnneetik bavaal machaa hua he
 Sidhu in his statement had justified the use of opium

 vahiin, akali dal ne bhi siddhu kii is maang ko gaiyr vaazib qaraar diya he
 According to the party, it is not an option that if the Punjab government is not able to eliminate synthetic drugs, then justify the sale of opium
 akali dal ke pravaktaa dalajit singh cheema ne kaha ki desh ke kuch rajyon main opium kii kheti kii jaati he, lekin vahaan ye kheti dawaaon or opium ke duusare vaazib istemaal ke liye sarkaar ke niyantran main kii jaati he

 ’ gammlin ne kaha ki haalanki esaisi kaa gathan pradesh sarkaar ne kiya tha, lekin yah adaalat ke nirdeshon par swatantra taur par peedies ghotaale kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Gamlin cited a court order dated June 15, 2007, saying, "these allegations are completely false and untested
" baaki kii jaanch sahi tarah se, nishpaksh or shighrata se ho, iske liye adaalat em es chouhan ko jaanch dal kaa pramukh niyukt karti he, jo sidhe adaalat ko jaankaree denge, na ki pradesh kii kisi agency ko
 He said, "to interrogate other accused, SIC has registered separate cases in different districts and the state government has no right to interfere in any case

 After a long time, such a film has made its way into Bollywood, which shows the story of the dacoits
 film main jis tarah kii bhashaa kaa istemaal kiya gaya he us lihaaj se ise family movie nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The film has been released on just 720 screens on Opening Day
 film kii kamai ke duusare din kaa collection saamne aa gaya he
 According to Taran Adarsh's tweet, Sushant Singh Rajput's film released the second day of release i
e
 1 on Saturday
 50 karod kii kamai kii he
 While the film grossed 1 on Opening Day
 20 karod rahi thi
 The film may have earned more than the first day, but the film has failed to make any significant increase
 phir bhi kam screens par relies hone ke baad film ke collection ko thik-thaak mana jayega
 It remains to be seen how the film's earnings are on Sunday and after that whether the film can maintain its rhythm in normal days

 The first fare increase was the number of rail Kafir number; Oil itself has been doing expensive for ten years, Chinese have made it expensive by showing a dream; Every man is cheating the common man by showing a dream
 The man is now afraid of China, not sugar, on the world moon, the government honeymoon is going full The tea chariots of the country, because of the inflation, empty tea cups, let the people tell you, when the good days are coming? There are many courageous people, who are raising children even during this inflation phase, just tell the keepers of the number of the government
when are the days to come? In my dream last night, Bullet Train, i said, "congratulations! Congratulations! You are coming to my country, you are increasing the speed of progress in the country

 namchin actor, ankar or ek umdaa insaan anupam kher bollywood ke itihaas main ek shandaar record banane ja rahe hai
 Anupam Kher will probably be the first actor whose new film is going to be released by five consecutive Fridays

 And next week, on November 7, apart from Akshay Kumar and Lisa Haydon, the film 'the Shaukeens' is coming with three elders at the center

 In such a situation, India is the country where gold consumption is the highest in the world and the tendency of people to buy gold on such occasions increases
 lekin world gold council kii yah report na sirf chaunkaane vaali he balki desh main sone kii jewelery kharid rahe adhikansh logon ke pairon tale jameen khisakane kaa dar bhi he
 Yes, the World Gold Council has claimed that gold purity in Hallmark Certified Gold Jewelery in India has been found to be different
 gauratlab he ki bharat main holmarking prakriya na sirfgold monetijeshan skimko safal banane ke liye kii jaati he balki iske sahare desh se sone kii jewelery ke niryaat ko maujuuda 8 billian dollar se badhaakar agle paanch saalon main 40 billian dollar tak le janaa bhi he
 However, gold hallmarking process is not legally required in the country
 lekin ise sone kii shuddhta par muhar lagane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he or desh main log is holmarking ko dekhne ke baad sone kii shuddhta par sawaal nahin uthaate
 It is to be noted that the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs has an administrative charge of Hallmarking of Gold
 vishwa gold council kii report ke mutabik desh main philhal 30 fisadi sone kii jewelery holmarcd he or desh main kuch holmarking kendron kii bhoomika sandigdh he
 Therefore, the actual hallmark jewelery in the country is less than 30 per cent
 saath hi hollmark hui jewelery main bhi alag-alag shuddhta dekhne ko mili he kyonki biies kaa quality control maikenism kamjor he or uske paas itani badi sankhya main shuddhta certificate dene kii paryaapt kshamta nahin he
 It is worth noting that there are about 220 BIS authorized hallmarking centers in the country, with the highest being 57 centers in Tamil Nadu and 39 centers in Kerala
 vahiin jahaan dakshin bharat main kul 153 kendra hai to uttar bharat main maatr 111 kendra hai
 At the same time the country consumes 800–1000 tons of gold every year and almost the entire gold is imported
 gita dutt ne film industry main naa to zyada vakt bitaayaa naa hi zyada gane gaae
 Geeta Dutt's career was considered much shorter than Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhosle
 magar iske baavjood is chote se kariyar main hi gita dutt ne apni aawaaj se jo prabhaav choda usne unhen legendry singer kaa tamgaa de diya
 By singing a few songs, Geeta created a status similar to Lata's
 gita dutt ko sunne waalon kii kami nahin he or new janareshan main bhi unke gaanen sune jate hai
 There was a twinge of personal life that caused a pain in his voice
 chahen jis mizaaj ke gane hon, gita ne jo ga diya wo is kadar popular hua ki naa jaane kitne dashak bitne ke baavjood bhi nayaa or ruhani lagata he
 The craze of Geeta Dutt's songs is also more because most of her songs have the Kashish which indicates to listen to her again
 unke gaanen jitani baar bhi sunon nae lagate hai or unase jaldi man nahin bharta
 On Geeta Dutt's birthday, he is reciting 10 such songs which will never lose its shine
 meri jaan mujhe jaan na kaho-anubhav film kaa ye gaanaa sanjeev kumaar or tanuja par filmaaya gaya tha
 This song, written by Gulzar in a fine voice with a natural sound of rain, was sung with great vigor by Geeta Dutt
 gane ko dashakon baad ai ajay devgan kii film renkot main phir se bajaayaa gaya jisamen aishwarya raay bachchan thim
 This song from Tadbir's spoiled Badde Bana le-baazi film was shot in Black and White Era
 vichlit dev anand par filmaaya ye gaanaa bada khubasurat tha
 After listening to this, there is definitely the idea of listening again
 gita dutt ke gaanon kaa craij isliye bhi zyada he
 Jaane Kahan Mera Jigar Gaya re-punished with Johnny Walker's tremendous comic expressions, this song is full of fun and makes you laugh
 koi chupake se aake-is geet ke atmik saundarya kaa koi jawaab nahin
 Whether you want lyrics, you want singing, you want music, this song is very beautiful
 ja ja ja bevafa-koi gaanaa kitna gaharaa ho saktaa he
 How sad a song can be
 koi gaanaa kitna hi udaasi se gaaya ja saktaa he
 Geeta Dutt starts singing the song that Rownte stands up
 bichhadne kii bhaavana ko darshata ye gaanaa gita dutt ke khud ke jivan kii dastaan bayaan karata he
 Samay kya kya kya haseen sitam-yeh song is also one of the most listened songs of Geeta Dutt's career
 babu ji dhire chalanaa-agar kisi ko lagata he ki swag verde bahut baad main aayaa to ye uski galatfahami he
 This song by Geeta Dutt has a swag
 ye gaanaa apane samay kaa trend setre mana jaataa he

 When Shahid Kapoor's film Kabir Singh was released, a lot of talk started about his role during that time
 kai guton ko is role se aapatti thi or logon ne film ko bain karne ti maang kii thi
 There was a lot of violence in the film
 saath hi nasha karne or mahilaon kii rispect naa karne vaale ek gussell insaan ko hero ke rup main dikhaaya gaya tha
 People believed that the youth would impress Kabir Singh and learn to behave like him
 haal-philhal main aisa hi ek udhaaharan dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 a person who follows the lead role of Kabir Singh, Kabir, has been charged with murder
 shaks ne khud bhi baad main suicide kar liya he
 The real name of Tick Talk star Johnny Dada, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, is Ashwani Kumar and is known as Tick Talk Villain
 ashwani, shahid kapur ke role kabir singh se kaaphi prerit the
 He has recently been accused of killing a flight attendant named Nikita Sharma
 darasal johny dada ko nikita pasand thi
 But when she came to know that the woman is going to get married in December this year, she did not stop and she killed the girl in anger
 magar haroonges baat to ye he ki johny dada ke liye katl karnaa koi nai baat nahin thi
 When the police go into details about Johnny Dada, they come to know that he has been charged with more murder
 tiktaoc par johny dada ne bahut zyada gussa karne vaale shaks kii image banaai thi
 Johnny Dada himself has committed suicide a week ago
 police ne kuch videos bhi dhundh nikaale jisamen johny dada, kabir singh ke dialogs bolte najar aa rahe hai
 In a video, he says - who cannot be mine will not give him the chance to be someone else

 The way to the center goes through UP and to win UP it is necessary to win Purvanchal
 isi formule ke tahat narendra modi 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main varanasi se lekar puure purvanchal main vipaksh kaa safaya kar diya tha
 In the 2017 assembly elections too, Modi managed to feed the lotus in Purvanchal
 is kamyaabi ko 2019 main ek baar phir dohraane ke liye narendra modi kaashi ke ran main utre hai
 However, this time it is not easy for the BJP to win the war of Purvanchal due to SP-BSP alliance and Eastern Uttar Pradesh command in the hands of Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi
 purvanchal kii 26 sitenuttar pradesh ke purvanchal main 21 jilon kii kul 26 loksabhaa siten or 130 vidhansabha siten aati hai
 Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Bansgaon, Faizabad, Bahraich, Shravasti, Gonda, Dumriaganj, Maharajganj, Ambedkarnagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Azamgarh, Ghoshi, Salempur, Ballia, Jaunpur, Ghazipur, Chandauli, Varanasi, Bhadoipur, Mirzapur Allahabad and Pratapgarh seats are included in this
 purvanchal main bijepi kaa kabjabta den ki narendra modi ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main varanasi se utarkar vipaksh kaa safaya kar diya tha
 Modi had an impact on the election results from UP to Bihar
 azamgarh purvanchal kii iklauti seat thi, jise bijepi nahin jeet saki thi
 sp's Mulayam Singh Yadav won this seat
 baaki purvanchal kii sabhi 25 loksabhaa siten bijepi or uske gathbandhan ke saathi jeetne main kaamyaab hue the
 Of these 23 seats were occupied by BJP and 2 seats by Apna Dal
 2009 or 2017 main bijepi kaa pradarshanpurvanchal kii loksabhaa siton par 2009 ke chunavi nateezon ko dekhen to sarvaadhik aath seat basapa ko, 7 sapa, 6 congress or paanch siten bijepi ko mili thi
 Narendra Modi had increased the bjp's tally to 21 seats from Varanasi in 2014, but for this Narendra Modi camped in Kashi for three days
 iske baad hue 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bijepi ne badi jeet darj kii thi
 Purvanchal has a total of 130 assembly seats, out of which BJP 87, Apna Dal 9, Bharatiya Suheldev Samaj Party 4, SP 14, BSP 10, Congress 1 and others 3
 jaateey samikarnapurvanchal kaa raajnneetik sameekaran 2014 se is baar kaaphi badla hua najar aa rahaa he
 SP-BSP alliance where there is a tough challenge on one side of BJP
 vahiin, congress kii mahasachiv priyanka gandhi ko purvanchal kii kaman milane ke baad bijepi kaa sameekaran gadabadata najar aa rahaa he
 If the SP-BSP alliance is uniting dalit-yadav and Muslim votes and presenting a tough challenge against Modi, the Congress is trying to dent Brahmin votes
 purvanchal brahmanon kaa majboot gampurvanchal kii adhiktar siton par brahman votaron kii mahatvapurn bhoomika rahati he
 The Brahmins were traditionally supporters of the Congress at one time, but after the Mandal movement, they turned to BJP
 baad main brahman votaron ke ek bade hisse kaa jhukaav mayawati kii basapa kii taraf bhi hua or 2014 ke aam chunaav main is tabake kaa jhukaav phir bijepi kii ore ho gaya
 As a result, in 2014 and 2017, BJP managed to capture the seats of Purvanchal
 congress or sapa-basapa se kadi chunautimana ja rahaa he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main priyanka gandhi inhen brahmanon ko congress ke paale main laane kii kavayad kar rahi hai
 Not only this, the Congress has fielded many veteran leaders in many seats in Purvanchal
 vahiin, akhilesh yadav is baar ke loksabhaa chunaav main modi ke formule ko maat dene ke liye khud azamgarh ke ran se utre hai
 In such a situation, repeating the charisma of victory in Purvanchal for BJP is like chewing iron gram

 modi pehle paanch din tak rajyasabha main nahin aae, is baat kaa isse behatar spashtikaran kya ho saktaa he
 
 
 The After all, he is a famous speaker
 unka yah bhi daawa he ki unki apni sarkaar or party par puri pakad he
 Despite this, he stayed away from the government's work for five days, forcing his government to postpone many tasks
 kya isaki vajah yah nahin he ki vah apane netaaon or mantriyon kii khaamiyon ke prati jimmedaari se bachanaa chaahate the
 After all, he is not only the Prime Minister of the country, he is also a member of Parliament
 yah unka pehla kaam hona chahie ki sansadeey jarurat ke mutabik vah sadan main upasthit rahen
 Even the smallest of us have to follow a three-line whip
 hamaare loktantr ko sanvaarane ke liye pradhanmantri apana kartavya nibhaate sadan main baithen, bahes ko sunen or yathasambhav behtareen tareeke se apni baat rakhen, isse zyada mahatvapurn kya ho saktaa he
 
 
 The mere dhyaan main kareeb 50 saal pehle kaa vakt yaad aa rahaa he, jab maine pehali baar loksabhaa ko dekha tha
 The year was 1960, and as far as i can remember, it was the month of February
 meri tulana main kahin behatar samparkon vaale mere ek mitra ne apane or apane mitron ke liye paason kaa intjaam kiya tha, taaki ham sansad main bahes kii kaarywahi ko dekh saken
 The debate was on the much-discussed incident at the time - Jawaharlal Nehru's central government disbanded the first elected communist government in the country's history - EMS Namboodiripad's government in Kerala
 rajya sarkaar ne rajya ke sabhi skulon kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya tha
 Since most educational institutions in the state were run by Christians, including schools in the 2,000-year-old Syrian Christian community, there was a strong opposition to the elimination of that private educational system that led to school and college education
 Kerala reached the first position in the country in this matter
 log sarkaar ke is kadam ke virodh main sadakon par utar aae or tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh indira gandhi ne virodh-pradarshan karne waalon kaa netritv karne kaa faisla kiya
 Due to disturbing the governance system, the Nehru government announced the imposition of President's rule in the state
 sadan main raashtrapati shashan lagane ke kaarnon par bahes ho rahi thi, or nehru sarkaar is mudde par baikfoot par najar aa rahi thi
 We went by bus from our college to Parliament House Bus Stand, which was then exactly where Mahatma Gandhi's statue is installed today
 ham darshak ddeergha kii apni siton par baith gaye, or mantrmugdh hokar commered ese daange kaa sambodhan suna, jisamen unhone nehru or congress kii galatiyon ke bare main bataaya
 Only his voice was echoing in the house - apart from his voice, there was pin-drop silence
 nehru unke saamne hi baithe hue, kisi gahare vichaar main duube hue the
 The Treasury Bench was also present in the disciplined decorum, swearing, but no disruption, no sloganeering
 daange ne sambodhan kaa samaapan jin shabdon main kiya, ve 50 saal baad bhi mere jehan main based hue hai
 He compared Nehru to Yudhishthira, whose chariot was always above the ground, because he never lied
 daange ne kaha ki jab yudhisthir ko safed jhooth bolne ko vivash kiya gaya ki ashwatthama maaraa gaya, jisase dronacharya ko vishwaas ho ki unka bete ashwatthama kii maut ho gai he, jabaki vastav main ashwatthama naamak hathi kii maut hui thi
 Yudhishthira's chariot fell to the ground after this lie
 daange ne kaha tha ki kerala sarkaar kii barkhaastagi ke saath hi nehru kaa rath jameen par aa gira he
 After this Nehru stood up to answer it
 unhone kya kaha tha, usamen se mujhe kuch bhi yaad nahin
 
 haa, mujhe yaad he ki us bahadur yoddha ne sansadeey protocol or loktantric mulyon ke chalate dusron ko bolne kaa har mauka diya, sabhi aaropon ko suna, or uske baad hi apane bachaav main kuch bolne ke liye uthe
 We have been expecting the same from Narendra Modi, but he has shown that he is absolutely disinterested in the democratic process, and has a sense of contempt for Parliament, otherwise coming to Parliament, and facing the charges of opposition - Or the fear of public criticism haunting them
 jis samay unhen sansad kaa saamana karnaa chahie tha, vah jammu-kashmir main chunaav prachaar karne chal die
 This was probably a sign of how nervous he was that the election results in Jammu and Kashmir would be the end of the Modi wave
 mujhe ek or baat yaad aa rahi he, kargil yuddh ke dauraan mujhe 26 oktober, 1962 ke da hindustan times ke pichley prishth par ek choti-si khabar mili thi, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki rajyasabha main jansangh ke netaa atal bihari vaajapeyi - jo us samay maatr 36 varsh ke the - pradhanmantri - jo us samay unase doguni umr yani 72 varsh ke the - se milane gaye, or maang kii ki loksabhaa main avkaash hone kii surat main bharat-china seemaa par chal rahe yuddh par charchaa ke liye rajyasabha kii baithak turant bulaai jaae
 Although Vajpayee himself turned down a similar request in the year 1999, Nehru was ready for that
 tab rajyasabha kii baithak 8 november, 1962 ko bulaai gai or yuva vaajapeyi ne pradhanmantri par tikhaa hamalaa kiya, lekin pradhanmantri mahoday ne saamaanya garima ke saath unhen suna evam sansadeey aacharan ke mutabik apane upar lage aaropon kaa jawaab diya
 According to Hiren Mukherjee, if the 'gentle king' Nehru had not developed democratic institutions with that dignity, today India would have been like the 150 countries which have got freedom till now, and it is possible that our situation is neighboring
 It would have been like Pakistan
 modi is baat ko samajhane ke liye taiyaar nahin dikh rahe hai ki sansadeey loktantr kaa paudha kitna kamjor hota he
 Perhaps he would not like to plant this plant in such a way so that he can do it at all times, like every ruler who keeps turning the pages of history
 kuch bhi ho, lekin hakeekat yahi he ki ucch sadan ke zyaadaatar sadasyon kii maang ke baavjood modi sadan main nahin aae, jabaki unki saathi saansad unase unki party ke kaaryakartaaon, pichhali bench par baithne vaale janpratinidhiyon or unke mantriyon ke aacharan par unase kuch kahana chaahate the
 Modi considers his home minister to be inferior to himself in all matters, but does not believe in the matter of answering in Parliament
 duusari ore, nehru kabhi apane loktantric dayitvon se nahin bhaage
 Whether it was the Jeep scandal in his early years of Parliament or the Mundra scandal in 1957-58, which was raised by his own son-in-law
 nehru hameshaa sadan main apni nirdhaarit jagah par baithe najar aae, apane or apni sarkaar ke upar lage aaropon ko talleenta se sunate or aaropon kaa jawaab dete
 He would also take action many times
 unhone 1952 main stock market ko prabhavit karne ke aarope main congress ke ek saansad ko nilambit kiya tha, or iske baad unhone apane pasandida vittamantri titike ko moondada cond main hataaya
 He also gave Lal Bahadur Shastri the freedom to listen to his conscience when he wanted to resign from the post of Railway Minister after a train accident in Ariyalur in far-off Tamil Nadu
 lekin modi apane badnaam saathiyon ke saath chipke rahanaa chaahate hai
 There is still a rape case accused in his cabinet
 belgaum giriraaj singh, jo modi ko vot nahin dene waalon ko pakistan bhej dena chaahate hai, ko mantripad dekar nawaja gaya he
 a woman, whose poor language should not call her a woman, has a place in the cabinet
 pichhali bench par baithne vaala or sadhu ke vesh main sansad aane vaala ek shaks, jo apni bhashaa kii vajah se bhagwaan kam, shaitan zyaada lagata he, ko na sirf mantrimandal main banaae rakhaa ja rahaa he, balki use protsaahit bhi kiya ja rahaa he, taaki vah duusare samudaayon ke khilaaf vidwesh failaana jari rakhe
 After electing a staunch RSS pracharak as Prime Minister, this is what the people of the country have got
 unke kattar saathiyon ko pradhanmantri kaa sangrakshan isliye mila hua he, kyonki ve pradhanmantri kii soch ke mutabik bolte hai
 Our national unity has never been more threatened than this Prime Minister's, because he does not have much respect for the dignity of our democracy, although he did a great job of kissing its stairs while entering this sacred complex
 aam aadmi party kii nitiyon se naaraaz kaaryakartaaon ko apni baat rakhane ke liye swaraj samvaad ke naam kaa ek manch bana he
 This platform has been set, only those associated with the Aam Aadmi Party and those who have joined it can become part of this dialogue
 gudgaanv ke iffko chowk par 14 april ko subah 10 baje se shaam 5 baje tak chintan manthan kaa daur chalegaa, jisamen desh or videsh se vah kaaryakarta hissaa lenge jo yah maanate hai ki aam aadmi party apane lakshya se bhatak rahi he
 Facebook, Twitter, Whats app and website are all active to make Swaraj dialogue successful
 yogendra-prashanth kii jodi, jo kabhi party kii piesi or think tanks kaa hissaa rahi, saare ohade chhin jane ke baad maujuuda haisiyat sirf kaaryakarta kii rah gai he
 In such a situation, he has made a new beginning through Swaraj dialogue so that a relationship can be formed with other party workers and other leaders who are angry or dissatisfied with the party
 iske liye fasebuk, twitor samet duusare tamaam jariye istemaal kiye ja rahe hai
 a former member of the national executive of the Aam Aadmi Party, Prof
 ajit jha kaa kahana he ki ab tak kareeb 2500 kaaryakartaaon ne hami bhari he
 Apart from this, 97 nris have also registered themselves
 27 rajyon se is samvaad kaa rispons mila he, jisamen dilli se 610, uttar pradesh se 476, uttar pradesh se 476, bihar se 219, haryana se 192 or maharashtra se 140 kaaryakarta shaamil hai
 The Swaraj Dialogue will discuss the basic issues that led to the foundation of the AAP
 is par bhi charchaa hogi ki kahin party makasad se bhatak to nahin rahi
 The condition of internal democracy of the party will be an important issue
 kaaryakartaaon kii bhoomika par bhi vichaar kiya jayega
 Further strategy will also be decided
 ab ise sanyog kaha jaae yaa damege control kii kavayad ki 14 april ko hone vaale swaraj samvaad ke thik pehle party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantri kejariwal bhi 11 or 12 april ko dilli main do jansabhaayen kar logon ko apane kaam ginaayenge

 These ideals are introduced through the words mentioned in the preface
 prastaavna ko kaise laayaa gaya?samvidhan sabha dwaara samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 On December 13, 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru introduced a motive in the Constituent Assembly
 jisamen bataaya gaya tha ki kis prakaar kaa samvidhan taiyaar kiya janaa he
 The proposal that was attached to this aim was included in the constitution as a preamble to the last phase of constitution making
 isi kaaran prastaavna ko uddeshika ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Where was the introduction in the Constitution? The idea of the Preamble in the Indian Constitution is derived from the Constitution of America
 vahiin prastaavna kii bhashaa ko australia samvidhan se liya gaya he
 The preface begins with "we the People of India" and ends on "26 November 1949 adopted"
 ye he prastaavna"ham bharat ke log, bharat ko ek sampoorn prabhutv sampann, samaajawaadee, panthanirpeksh, loktantratmak ganraajya banane ke liye tathaa uske samast nagarikon ko:saamaajik, aarthik or raajnneetik nyaay, vichaar, abhivyakti, vishwaas, dharm or upasna kii swatantraaa, pratishtha or avasar kii samta praapt karne ke liye tathaa un sab main vyakti kii garima or raashtra kii or ekta akhandta sunishchit karanevaali bandhuta badhaane ke liye drudh sankalp ho kar apni is samvidhan sabha main aaj taarikh 26 november, 1949 i0 "miti maarg sheersh shukla saptami, samvath do hazaar chah vikrami) ko etad samvidhan ko angeekrut, adhiniimat or atmarpit karte hai

 piem modi ne shahbaano cese ke bahaane aarif mohammad khan ko surkhiyon main laa diya thatin talaak par aarif mohammad khan kaa bayaan bijepi ke liye hameshaa dhaal bana rahabijepi ko lagata he ki khan ek pragatisheel cheharaa hai or unke bayaan party ke fevar main hancongress, janata dal, basapa se hote hue 2004 main bijepi kaa daaman thaamne vaale aarif mohammad khan jab kaisarganj loksabhaa seat kaa chunaav haare to phir baad main vah sakriy raajnneeti se dur ho gaye

 kisi dal se nahin judaa hum
 Arif Mohammad Khan distanced himself from political platforms
 ab vah saamaajik / saanskrithik sanghathanon ke kaaryakramon tak simit ho gaye
 Due to outspoken criticism of radicalism as an Islamic scholar, there would be a competition to call such issues in right-wing organizations
 muslimon ke prati congress kii soch par prahaar karne vaale bayaan hameshaa bijepi cirkil main pasand kiye jate rahe
 Among Muslims, they are liked and disliked
 ek varg pragatisheel or sudhaarak maanakar unhen pasand karata he to doosraa dhada bijepi kii line par chalane vaala shaks maanakar naapsand bhi karata he
 When PM Modi made Arif in the headlines, in the Lok Sabha on 25 June, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a gutter statement about Muslims while besieging Congress on the pretext of Shahbano case, suddenly Arif Mohammad Khan came into the media headlines
 piem modi ne bagair aarif kaa naam liye unke puraane intervyuu kaa hawala dete hue kaha tha ki congress ke ek mantri ne khud kaha he ki congress yah maanati he musalamaanon ke utthan kii jimmedaari uski nahin he, agar wo gater main pade rahanaa chaahate hai to pade rahane do
 Actually, the gutter thing was said by Narasimha Rao to Arif Mohammad Khan
 piem modi ke is zikr ke baad lambey arase baad aarif mohammad khan menstream media se lekar soshal media main chaa gaye

 amit shah ne tab kaha tha ki kaanoon banane ke baad pehali baar vah teen talaak par bol rahe hai
 At the beginning of the discussion, Amit Shah praised Arif Mohammad Khan very much
 unhone kaha, “main aarif mohammad khan ko sabhi kii taraf se badhai dena chahta hoon jo musalmaan hokar bhi teen talaaq ke khilaaf bolte rahe
 a single man stood against the decision of the Rajiv Gandhi government
 aaj bhi wo teen talaaq par mukhar hokar bolte rahete hai
 After the praise of Amit Shah, there was speculation that the government could later use Arif Mohammad Khan's progressive face by giving him some important responsibility
 mana ja rahaa tha ki aarif ko lekar amit shah ne jo tarif kii he wo besabab nahin he
 There were discussions at that time that the BJP could make progressive face Arif Mohammad Khan the face of the party
 unhen piem modi apni cabinet main le sakate hai
 Or put it on a mission related to the welfare of minorities
 akhirkaar modi sarkaar ne unhen kerala ke rajyapal pad se nawaaza he
 Why BJP Likes Arif: Arif Mohammad Khan's statement on three divorces has always been a shield for BJP
 quran and contemporari chalanges naamak best celler kitaab likh chuke aarif ke bayanon ke zarie bijepi ne kai maukon par yah jataane kii koshish kii ki teen talaak kaa kaanoon muslimon ke khilaaf nahin balki muslimon ke hit main laayaa gaya he
 The choice behind Arif Khan in BJP is his style of attacking the Congress with all the references and arguments and parables on religious bigotry
 bijepi ko lagata he ki aarif mohammad khan ek pragatisheel cheharaa hai
 His statements go in favor of party politics
 unhen saath jodakar muslim virdohi chhavi ko taar-taar bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 By making Arif the governor, the BJP wants to convey that it is also in favor of advancing nationalist and progressive Muslim faces
 kerala main party ke vistaar main bhi aarif madadgaar sabit ho sakate hai

 1
 Donating items made of iron on Saturday is considered to be of special importance
 lohe kaa saamaan daan karne se shanidev prasann hote hai or vyapaar munafa dene lagate he
 Donate iron on Saturday, but avoid shopping for items made of iron for your family
 2
 Donate oil on Saturday and avoid buying oil

 3
 agar khaane kaa swaad badhaane vaala namak khareednaa he to behatar hoga shanivaar ke bajaay kisi or din hi khariden
 There is a possibility of debt rising or increasing due to buying salt on Saturday
 4
 Purchased scissors on Saturday brings tension in the relationship, so if you want to buy scissors then you can buy any day other than Saturday
 5
 Shani Dev is happy by offering black sesame and removes it from many plagues, but on this day, buying black sesame interrupts the work
 shanivaar ko kaale til kabhi na khariden
 6
 agar aapako kaale rang ke juute kharidne hai to shanivaar ko na khariden
 It is believed that black shoes purchased on Saturday cause the wearer to fail
 7
 Thursday is the best day to buy things related to education, such as: paper, pen and ink pot
 isliye shanivaar ko syaahi na khariden

 'bablu happy he' ko diarect kiya he nila madhab pandas ne, jo isse pehle kaaphi tarif bator chuki 'ai em kalam' jaisi film bana chuke hai
 'bablu Happy Hai' is a light-hearted comedy-giving message

 Here are three friends, Sahil Anand, who was seen in 'student of the Year', Sumit Suri and Amol Parashar in the third

 Sahil and Sumit Suri have good performances

 The title song of the film 'aaj to Bablu Happy Hai' has already climbed everyone's tongue
 kul milakar 'bablu happy he' ek thikthak film he
 The message of the film is good, which is a must watch
 meri ore se is film ko dhai stars

 On Saturday evening, when Jatin came to visit the Shani temple, the three called him along on the pretext of feeding samosa and then took him to a farm near Chhatarpur

 vah in dinon khuleam kah rahe hai ki agar koi unhen hataanaa chahta he to vidhyak dal kii baithak bulaakar is baat kaa faisla kar le
 Manjhi said this in his press conference after the Janata Durbar in Patna on Monday
 unhone yahaan tak kah daalaa ki unhen mukhyamantri banaate vakt party ne bhale prastaav diya ho ki agali baar unki party ko bahumat mila to nitish kumaar ko mukhyamantri banaaya janaa chahie
 Manjhi says, 'it will be my duty to propose the name of Nitish Kumar himself, but as far as i feel he would like to hear you, i want that once again someone from the Dalit community sits on the Chief Minister's chair 
 ' Certainly both statements of Manjhi are an open challenge for Nitish Kumar and it is believed that he is aware of the battle for change of power against him and the round of meetings with Nitish Kumar and hence he spoke his mind

 Meanwhile, Union Minister Uma Bharti met Jitan Ram Manjhi at his residence and praised him

 justise dinesh mehta ne maamle kii sunwaayee kii
 Advocates Rajendra Saraswat and Abir Roy appeared on the court on behalf of CAT
 cat ne apni rit yachika main amejan or flipcart dwaara epadiai niti ke nirantar or baar-baar ulalanghanon par jor daalaa or unke dwaara epadiai niti ke ulanghan ko doharaaya he
 Kat said in the petition that because these companies are engaged in deep discounts, delivery of goods below cost and loss funding and are controlling the inventory, thereby establishing their market place as an inventory based model which allows FDI
 There is a clear violation of policy
 cat ne yah bhi kaha ki ye i-commers companiyaan gahari chhot de rahi hai jo ek tarah se bazaar main keemton ko prabhavit kar rahi hai jo epadiai niti ke tahat phir se nishiddh hai
 CAT also raised the issue of how these e-commerce companies do not own inventory, so how can they offer discounts on goods owned by other individuals
 cat ne aage kaha ki ye i-commers companiyaan epadiai niti ko bahut khule taur par darkinar kar rahi hai or adhikariyon ko shikaayat karne ke baavjood unke khilaaf ab tak koi karrwai nahin kii gai he

 There are about 35 such parties in the country who join alliances before the Lok Sabha elections
 yaa to ye partiyaan bijepi netritv vaale endie main yaa phir congress netritv vaale upie gathbandhan se chunaav purv siton par tolmol to karti hai, lekin aamtaur par har chunaav main ek gathbandhan yaa uske aasapaas vaali partiyon se samjhauta karte hai
 But out of these 35 parties, there are 9 who enter into a pre-poll agreement between two anti-polar alliances
 chaar loksabhaa chunaavon gathbandhan se jude aankade bataate hai ki tamilnadu kii chaar pramukh raajnneetik partiyaan pehle paaydaan par hai
 This title is because these parties, apart from almost all alliances, UPA and NDA, have compromised seats from the Third Front
 samjhaute ke baad agar chunavi nattejey thik nahin aae to agle chunaav main ye partiyaan duusare gathbandhan kaa hissaa ban jaati hai
 In 1999, DMK, MDMK and PMK along with bjp-led NDA contested 31 seats in Tamil Nadu and won 21
 jabaki chauthi badi party ediemke congress netritv vaale upie ke saath chunaav ladi or 10 seat jeet pai
 AAAEDM but in the next Lok Sabha elections (2004), all these parties overturned
 diemke, emdmake or piemke upie ke saath to ediemke bijepi netritv vaale endie kaa daaman tham liya
 Although the UPA parties benefited, the aiadmk's bet was backfired, it could not even open an account in the Lok Sabha seat in Tamil Nadu
 jabaki isi chunaav main upie ke saath aane par diemke ne 16 seat, piemke ne 5 seat or emdmake ne 4 loksabhaa seat jeet liya
 After the account was not opened in 2004, AAAEDMK joined the new coalition Third Front in 2009 and won 9 seats
 lekin 2014 main ediemke akele chunaav ladi or tamilnadu kii 39 main se 37 siton par record jeet hasil kii
 The rest of the Tamil parties joining the NDA were reduced to two seats despite the Modi wind
 2014 main piemke or bijepi ko maatr ek-ek seat mil pai
 Now the AIADMK is going to contest the elections again with the NDA in 2019 through UPA, NDA, Third Front
 piemkepiemke bhi endie, upie, third front or endie ke baad phir se 2019 main phir se endie ke rath par savaar hone vaali he
 From the vote share to the seat of the party that had interfered in the vote bank within the backward castes, it continued to decline
 2009 main to piemke jiro par simat gai
 The PMK had contested with the Third Front at that time
 diemkegathbandhan kii raajnneeti kii shuruyaat 1999 se maani jaati he
 In this initial phase, the DMK, the second largest party in Tamil Nadu, contested with the NDA, but in the next election i
e
 in 2004, the Congress-led coalition joined the UPA and won 16 seats
 lagaataar seat main phayda dekhte hue diemke ne 2009 kaa chunaav bhi upie ke saath ladaa or 18 seat par jeet hasil kii
 However, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, DMK contested on the lines of AIADMK alone and could not even open the account
 haalanki diemke 27 siton par duusare number kii party thi
 The politics of MDMK, the fourth major party in the politics of mdmktamilnadu, has been swinging between alliances like the PMK
 1999 me endie, 2004 main upie or 2009 main teesraa morcha or 2014 main phir endie ke saath chunaav ladi
 In 2014, despite the wind of Modi, his MDMK could not even open an account in Tamil Nadu
 trinmul congresammata banerjee ke netritv vaale trinmul congress ne 1999 or 2004 kaa chunaav endie ke saath milakar ladaa
 Got 8 seats for the first time, but only two seats the second time
 mamata ne tisare chunaav yani 2009 main upie se haath milaayaa or 19 siton par jeet hasil kar lee
 After that in 2014, Trinamool did not go with any alliance
 lekin party 2019 ke chunaavon ke liye ek baar phir gathbandhan kaa hissaa banane ja rahi he
 According to current indications, Mamata Banerjee may contest the 2019 elections in the name of the grand alliance
 lok janashakti partygathabandhan main aane-jane ko lekar lok janashakti party ke netaa ramvilas paswan ko virodhiyon ne mausam vigyaani jaisaa khitaab de daalaa he
 Lok Janshakti Party contested with UPA in 2004 and won four seats
 bihar kii raajnneeti main lalu yadav ke haisiyat ko aankate hue lok janashakti party ne 2009 kaa chunaav lalu yadav or sapa kii or banaae gaye tathakthith chauthe morche ke saath chunaav ladaa
 But nobody could win the seat
 haar ke baad 2014 main ramvilas paswan kii party bijepi netritv vaale gathbandhan endie ke kheme main ja pahunchi, jahaan saat siton par chunaav ladate hue chah main jeet hasil kar lee
 In the National Lok Dalup, the party which is swinging between the two opposing alliances has been the National Lok Dal, but it has been unfortunate that the one with whom it contested could not reach power
 1999 main areldi ne congress netritv vaale gathbandhan upie kaa haath thama jabaki 2009 main endie kii
 With this change, the number of seats increased from 2 to 5, but the coalition supporting them could not reach power
 endie main kismat aajamaane ke baad 2014 main areldi phir se upie ke saath ai lekin use kisi seat par jeet hasil nahin hui
 According to early indications, in 2019 RLD may contest some seats in UP, taking support of SP-BSP alliance
 republican party of india (e)maharashtra main gathbandhan badalane kaa record arpiai (e) ke paas he
 The party was part of the UPA in 2004 and 2009 and the party did not get any seats except in 2004
 upie main naakaami ke baad arpiai (e) ne 2014 main endie ke chhatrachhaaya main ai lekin vahaan bhi party ko koi kamyaabi nahin mili
 There is one such party in the north-east region of the country which has tried two major alliances in the pre-election
 arunachal congress 1999 main endie ke saath chunaav purv gathbandhan kiya lekin jab koi seat nahin mili to 2004 main upie ke saath aa gai lekin party ko iske baavjood party ko koi seat nahin mili
 These parties usually opt for alliances other than regionalism, caste votebank and to avoid old legal matters

 co / h9tucekhcv— Muhammad Waseem 🦅 (@mwaseemofficial) September 15, 2019 In Pakistan, there is no attention to any sport other than cricket
 yaa phir vahaan ke halaat aise hai, jo khilaadiyon ke liye utsahvardhak nahin hai
 In such a situation, Pakistani sports talent is dying
 bijepi saansad shatrughna sinha mangalvaar ko khuleam bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar or unke sahyogi argedy supremeo lalu prasad se mili
 However, we met separately
 shatrughna ko bihar vidhansabha chunaav main party ne darkinar kar diya tha
 Since then, he had been continuously registering his displeasure
 lalu ne kya kaha shatrughna se?patna sahib saansad shatrughna patna hawaii adde par lalu se garmjoshi ke saath mili
 Lalu was accompanied by his wife Rabri Devi and Shatrughan along with his elder brother Lakhan Sinha
 sutron ne bataaya ki lalu ne shatrughna kii unhen darkinar kar die jane ke liye bijepi netritv se akele loha lene par mazaakia andaaj main peeth thapthapate hue kaha, ‘tarif kii baat he ki akele lathi se puure bhaajapa vaale ko khadede hue hai
 This is how Nitru met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar at a wedding in Patna
 par nitish ne unase kaha ki chunaav kaa hi samay thik tha, jab hamaari aksar mulaakaat ho jaaya karti thi
 Asked about Shatrughan's meeting with party opponents, he said that once friends are made, they always remain friends
 ve donon ek-duusare ko lambey samay se jaanate hai or dosti koraajnneetik najariese nahin dekha janaa chahie
 Shatrughan, who is considered to be the LK Advani camp in the SJP, has been praising Nitish and has made an uncomfortable situation for his party by meeting and praising Nitish several times in the past
 nitish or lalu bhi shatrughna kii prashansa karte rahe hai
 The demand to get him out of the party has also arisen

 haalanki, aisa hona aasaan nahin he or ab bhartiya janata party ke sthaneey netaa tathaa jammu-kashmir ke purv upmukhyamantri nirmal singh ne centre sarkaar se domissile jaisi kadi vyavastha laane kaa suzav diya he
 Former Deputy Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Nirmal Singh has spoken of bringing the voice of local citizens to the central government
 doctor nirmal singh ne kaha, 'ham centre sarkaar ko jameen se sambandhit adhikaron ke vikalp ke bare main suzav denge
 The Center is already exploring options to ensure local rights
 ''sthaneey nagarikon kii suraksha ahm'nirmal singh ne kaha, 'ham jald hi jammu-kashmir main bhoomi se sambandhit adhikaron ko prastaavit karenge
 The interests of local citizens will be protected
 jis tarah se punjab or himachal pradesh main krishi yogya bhoomi nahin kharidi ja sakati, aisi hi vyavastha yahaan bhi honi chahie
 However, the central government is already considering such an option
 'jammu-kashmir vidhansabha ke spikar nirmal singh ne yah bhi kaha ki nijee sectoron ke aane se rajya main udyog jagat ko badhaava milegaa
 He hoped that there would not be any kind of abuse and the interest of the land owners would remain intact
 unhone kaha ki agar koi apni jameen bechnaa chaahe to bech saktaa he
 But the fear of this poison is being spread that outsiders will come here and buy the whole land and settle here
 is tarah kii kisi bhi sambhaavna se inkaar karte hue unhone kaha, 'main yah aashwaasan de saktaa hum ki aisa nahin hoga
 If Kashmiri leaders can welcome terrorists and Pakistan-backed people here, why can't they do the industry? 'jammu and Kashmir is going to change from state to Union Territory soon
 aisa hone se rajya main rojgaar kii sambhaavnaaen bad sakati he
 He said that only 6 percent people are in government jobs
 jabaki 90 fisadi log kashmir ke nivasee hai
 Now they will have new employment opportunities
 'pariwaron kaa khatm hua visheshadhikaar'nirmal singh ne kaha ki rajya main ab tak kuch hi pariwaron ke paas visheshadhikaar tha
 Whereas Jammu, Ladakh, Gurjars, Bakkarwals and Valmikis were discriminated against
 sansad se anuchhed 370 ke jariye rajya ko mili special states kaa darja hataae jane ke baad hi doctor nirmal singh ne apni gaadi se jammu-kashmir kaa jhanda utaar diya tha
 Earlier, his car had the flag of Tricolor and Jammu and Kashmir, but now he has removed the flag of Jammu and Kashmir
 iske baad unki gaadi par sirf ek hi jhanda (tirangaa) laga hua he
 It is not easy for outsiders to buy land After the special status status has been lifted from Jammu and Kashmir, it is being propagated everywhere that anyone in the valley can go and buy land
 lekin agar jammu-kashmir ko chhod bhi diya jaae to kai rajya aise hai jinke liye vishesh praavdhaan ke tahat har kisi ke liye jameen kharidne par pratibandh he
 And now there is a demand for making similar arrangements here, there are many areas in the country, where it is not possible for outsiders to buy land there due to Article 371
 kai rajya aise hai, jahaan par kheti yogya jameen nahin kharidi ja sakati
 In Himachal Pradesh, outsiders cannot buy land for farming
 awasaiya jameen kharidne ke liye sarkaar se anumati leni hoti he
 Similarly, in Uttarakhand, outsiders are prohibited from buying land
 saath hi aisa prabandh bhi kiya gaya he ki jameen builder ke haathon na chalaa jaae
 There is a ban on buying cultivable land in Tamil Nadu
 gaiyr kheti yogya jameen kharidne ke liye bhi kade niyam he or vahi jameen bechi ja sakati he jahaan 10 saalon se kheti na ho rahi ho
 Karnataka and Kerala also have stricter rules for buying land for outsiders
 purvottar bharat ke nagaland, mizoram or sikkim main bahari logon ke liye jameen kharidne par pratibandh he
