 Why the problem of stubble remains? Harvesters from Haryana and Punjab are used around Delhi to harvest rabi and kharif crops
 ye harvester is tarah se bane hai ki fasal ko ghutanon tak kii oonchai tak katate hai
 Due to which farmers burn the residue (parali) of the crop and clean the fields
 yadi harvester main stra reeper laga die jaaen to fasal bilkul neeche se kategi orparalibachegi hi nahin, lekin aisa ho nahin paa rahaa
 Why this is not happening? When crops were harvested by hand 15-20 years ago, there was no problem of stubble because then it was harvested from the roots but now due to wrong technique of harvester, problems are arising
 maine isi samasya se nipatane ke liye madhya pradesh main engiti main yachika lagaai thi or vahaan se sabhi colectoron ko yah aadesh die gaye the ki kisi jile main bina stra reeper vaala harvester ghusane na diya jaae

 On May 17, Iqra, the elder daughter of legal adviser MM Khan at NDMC, told NDTV India that my mother told me that the owner of The Connaught Hotel, in Connaught Place, was accused of defending the ndmc's dues of crores of rupees on the hotel
 Was making pressure for rishwat dene kii peshkash kar rahaa tha or un par dabaab bana rahaa tha
 The daughter's suspicion was correct, the police arrested the owner of the hotel, Ramesh Kakkar, and along with 5 more people, and claimed to have settled the entire case

 According to the police, Ramesh, the owner of the property worth about 100 crore, conspired with his personal security guard Ramphool
 ramphul ne israel, saleem, aamir, anwar or bilal ko 2 lakh main khan ko maarane kii supaari di
 On 16 May, Anwar and Bilal came in the back of Khan's car riding on the bike and Anwar shot Khan while sitting on the bike near the house

 It was licensed by NDMC for Youth Hostel but Ramesh Kakkar opened the hotel in it

 Ramesh did not fill the outstanding amount and the amount gradually increased to about 225 crores
 tippaniyan The case reached the High Court last year
 hycourt ne 6 maheene ke andar endiemasi se hal nikaalane ko kaha
 Ramesh Kakkar was pressurizing Khan to court help by offering a bribe, Khan was not ready for it

 If the verdict came against him, Ramesh would have had to vacate the hotel or pay the entire dues
 lekin faisle ke ek din pehle hi ramesh ne khan kii hatya karvaa di
 Police is now searching for Bilal who is absconding with the pistol

 25 saal pehle lakhanu ke hi begum hazrat mahal park main jab mulaayam singh yadav ne samaajawaadee party kii sthapana kii thi tab se party ek lanbaa safar tay kar chuki he
 On the strength of this party, Mulayam Singh Yadav himself became the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh thrice, became the Defense Minister of the country and his son Akhilesh Yadav was also crowned the youngest
 party kii 25veen saalagirah ko yaadgaar or shandaar banane ke liemulaayam singh yadavane apni puri takat lagaai he
 The Janeshwar Mishra Park in Lucknow, where the party's silver jubilee celebrations are being held on Saturday, is said to be one of the largest parks in Asia
 akhilesh yadav ko apane jin kaamon par fakr he usne yah park banvaanaa main shaamil he
 But on November 5, this park has the responsibility of raising a crowd of millions
 His uncle Shivpal Yadav is taking care of him, which has made him stubborn
 rajat jayanti samaaroh aise maukey par ho rahaa he jab party se lekar parivaar menghmasanmacha hua he or kahaan ja rahaa he ki shivpal yadav or akhilesh yadav ke bich shakti pradarshan kii hode he
 The circumstances under which Mulayam Singh Yadav is celebrating the 25th anniversary can be gauged from the fact that the entire responsibility of the ceremony has been given to the same Gayatri Prajapati whom Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav did not like at all and was thrown out of his cabinet
 party ke jin yuva netaaon ne akhilesh yadav kii rathyatra ke peeche apni puri takat lagaai vah sab party ke baahar hai or party ke rajat jayanti samaaroh main unako nahin bulaayaa gaya he
 But he is saying that he will go to this function
 taiyaariyon kaa jayja lene aae shivpal yadav ne kaha ki jo party ke baahar hai unhen yahaan bulaane kaa sawaal hi nahin paidaa hota
 Akhilesh Yadav will be present on the stage at the Silver Jubilee celebrations but in the same manner as his Shivrat Yadav was on the stage of his Rath Yatra celebrations

 From former Prime Minister Deve Gowda to Sharad Yadav, Ajit Singh, Chautala and Lalu Yadav will all be present on the stage
 janeshwar mishra park main taiyaariyaan puri kii ja chuki he jiskaa jayja lene shivpal yadav or gayatri prajapati shuukravaar kii shaam ko pahunche
 Mulayam Singh Yadav was taking reports of preparations moment by moment
 taiyaariyon ke bare main poochne ke liye shuukravaar ko mulaayam singh yadav khud chalakar shivpal yadav ke ghar gaye the
 Mulayam Singh said that Mike should be taken special care because the mic that was in the Rath Yatra ceremony was not good
 mulaayam singh ne yah bhi nirdesh diya kii samaaroh main jo mahilaayein aae unhen aage baitaane kaa intjaam kiya jaae
 It was also directed by Mulayam Singh that all arrangements should be made for better coverage in the media
 in nirdeshon ko dekhte hue shaam ko media ke manch ko bada kiya gaya or mike kii khaas taur par testing kii gai
 a grand pandal has been built for the ceremony but only a few thousand people will be able to come to the pandal
 isiilie baahar park main kursiyaan lagaai ja rahi hai or LED screen kaa intjaam kiya ja rahaa he taaki log aaraam se baithkar samaaroh kaa anand le saken
 Taking stock of the preparations, Shivpal Yadav recalled his old days in a special conversation from today till date and said that he has been struggling for the party since the time he used to cycle by himself
 gayatri prajapati kaa daawa he ki samaaroh itnaa shandaar hoga ki logon ko yaad rahegaa
 a small platform has been built next to the Chief Minister on which colorful cultural programs will be held
 party main mache ghamaasan or sar par chunaav ke bich mulaayam singh yadav janata parivaar ke apane saathiyon ko jutakar yah sandesh dena chaahate hai ki vah chunautiyon ke bich ghabaraane vaale vyakti nahin hai
 Like Bihar, in Uttar Pradesh too, the Samajwadi Party, in coordination with the JDU, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, wants to join the race of power again vigorously
 khud akhilesh yadav yah maanate hai ki party main jo kuch hua use party pichad gai he
 But can the silver jubilee celebrations of the party celebrated vigorously cover the gap between the families? Everyone will be watching this question and the workers will also want to see whether the distance between Shivpal and Akhilesh will be found even on this historic occasion

 Astronomers have discovered and photographed a planet present in another solar system that is expected to capture important information regarding the formation of planets like our Jupiter
 haal hi main jari kii gai ek study main yah kaha gaya he
 Scientists discovered the planet using a new Gemini Planet Imager set on top of a telescope in Chail
 iskaa naam rakhaa gaya 51 Eridani b
 It is located 96 light years away from the Earth
 yah suraj jaise ek yuva grah ke chakkar katata he or jupiter se doguna bada he
 It is one of the smallest planets that have been found outside of their solar system and can be photographed

 us grah se infrared lite paidaa ho rahi he
 According to an article published in this week's issue in Science Journal by Astronomer Mackintosh of Stanford University and his colleagues, 51 Eri b offers an opportunity to read in detail the planets that are still affected by the initial conditions of their creation
 is jupiter jaise grah ke vaataavaran main methen gas sarvaadhik pai gai
 This discovery will also give scientists some clues to know how large planets of such gas are formed
 ek statement main uniwarsity of arizona ke vaigyanik travis barman ne kaha ki yah kharbon saal pehle jupiter jaisaa lagata tha, 51 Eri b vaisaa hi lagane vaale grahon main shaayad yah sabase yuva grah he

 It was named 51 Eridani b
 yah dharti se 96 prakaash varsh duuri par sthit he

 Methane gas was found most in the atmosphere of this planet like Jupiter
 is khoj se vaigyanikon ko yah bhi pataa chal sakane ke liye kuch sanket milenge ki aise gas ke bade planets aakhir banate kaise hai
 In a statement, University of Arizona scientist Travis Barman said that it looked like Jupiter billions of years ago, it is probably the youngest planet among 51 Eri b similar planets
 jo, hamaare grahon ke banane kii paheli ko sulajhane kii disha main mahatvapurn lag rahaa he

 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi buudhvaar ko gujarat ke mehsana main chunavi raily kar rahe hai
 With this, Rahul is also starting his party's campaign for the next year's assembly elections in the state
 rahul ne apni pehali chunavi raily ke liye is jagah ko hi kyon chunaa? or rahul kii is siyaasi ranneeti kaa asar kya hoga
 
 
 It is important to know
 uttari gujarat main basaa mehsana piem narendramodi kaa grih jilahai
 Apart from this, Mehsana Patidar has been a stronghold of reservation movement
 notebandi ke baad piem modi par hamalavar hue rahul gandhi kii gujarat main yah pehali sabha he
 Government issues new decrees regarding demonetisation
 congress is sabha ke jariye notebandi ke baad upje janaakrosh ko bhunaane kii koshish bhi karegi
 The strategy of the Congress is to make Modi the first challenge in his district through Rahul's meeting
 sanad rahe ki kuch dinon pehle piem modi ne mehsana jile ke disa main hi kisaanon kii raily ko sambodhit kiya tha
 In such a situation, Rahul wants to spread his message to the farmers in the state, he is also interested in making a place among the Patidar community
 2015 main hue sthaneey nikaay chunaavon main congress ne mehsana mengila or taluka panchayat kii sitenzti thim
 In such a situation, the Congress, out of power for nearly two decades in the state, wants to strengthen the ground for assembly elections through Rahul's rally
 rahul keval mehsana hi nahin, balki dakshin gujarat, madhya gujarat, saurashtra or kuccha main bhi jald hi chunavi reliyaan karne vaale hai
 The ruling BJP had to face the Patidar reservation agitation last year in the state
 us vakt rajya kii mukhyamantri raheen anandiben patel is andolan ko kaabo karne main puri tarah vifal rahi thim
 The movement was led by the youth leader Hardik Patel and this movement received a lot of support from the Patel community here
 yah samudaay bijepi kaa bada vot bank rahaa he
 Congress may also feel that the absence of a young leader can be exploited in the present times
 vaise main gujarat main modi-yug se pehle uttari gujarat congress kaa garh rahaa tha
 Now at a time when the bjp's position in this area is getting a little weak, the Congress wants to take advantage of this opportunity
 narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad soobe main do mukhyamantri badal chuke hai
 The ruling party may be in a dilemma over whether it will contest the next election by putting forward the face of PM Modi or contesting the election with the help of incumbent CM Vijay Rupani
 aise main congress ko ummid he ki wo rahul gandhi ko aage rakhkar soobe main apni siyaasi jameen majboot kare

 Diabetes can cause many diseases such as heart attacks, seizures, blindness, nerve problems
 shodhakartaaon ne apane adhyayan main britain samet aath europea deshon ke 16,800 swasth vayaskon or tip 2 madhumeh se peedit 12,400 marijon ko shaamil kiya tha
 The study found that people who ate at least 55 grams of cheese every day: about two pieces: were 12 percent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes
 isi tarah har roj 55 gram dahi khaane vaale logon main bhi tip 2 madhumeh kii sambhaavna itani hi kam pai gai
 The comments saalon tak kaha jaataa rahaa he ki dugdh utpaadon ke adhik seven se madhumeh kaa khatra bad jaataa he kyonki inamen santrupt vasa kaa ooncha str hota he jisase cholestrol bad jaataa he
 Excess cholesterol increases the risk of diabetes
 britain aadhaarit shodhakarta doctor iyen frem ne kaha, ‘‘ham swasth khanpan par jor dete hai, aisa khaanaa jisamen namak or vaasa kaa str kam ho, lekin inase bachane ke liye dugdh utpaadon kaa kam seven karne kii manyata ko yah adhyayan jhuthlaata he
 Researchers in Britain and the Netherlands found that eating two pieces of cheese every day reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by 12 percent, the Daily Mail reported
 madhumeh se hridyaghaat, daura, andhaapan, tantrika samasyaayein jaisi kai bimaariyaan ho sakati hai
 The researchers included 16,800 healthy adults and 12,400 patients with type 2 diabetes in eight European countries, including Britain, in their study
 adhyayan main paaya gaya ki jin logon ne har roj kam se kam 55 gram chiz khaaya tha :lagbhag do tukade: unamem tip 2 madhumeh ke hone kii sambhaavna 12 pratishat kam thi
 Similarly, the possibility of type 2 diabetes was also found to be less in people who eat 55 grams of curd every day

 Robin Bisht scored a lucrative half-century but South Zone cheaply dismissed the in-form Naman Ojha and Mahesh Rawat to win the first day of the Duleep Trophy cricket tournament final against Central Zone
 toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji ke liye utre madhya kshetra ne pehle din kaa khel samaapt hone tak saat wicket par 237 ran banaaye hai jisamen bisht ne 79 ran kaa yogadan diya
 Like the 26-year-old Rajasthan batsman, openers Faiz Fazal (49) and Ashok Maneria (37) could not convert a good start into a big innings
 captain piyush chawla (30) kaa din ke aakhri kshanon main out hona bhi madhya kshetra ko baari padaa
 Arindam Ghosh was playing for 32 at stumps
 madhya kshetra ko haalanki sabase bada jhatka naman ojha ke keval chaar ran par pavilion lautne se laga
 The wicketkeeper batsman had earlier scored 687 runs in the last five innings which included two double centuries
 uttar kshetra ke khilaaf semifinal main duusari pari main visham paristhitiyon main shatak jadne vaale mahesh ravat aaj khaataa bhi nahin khol paye
 South Zone used eight bowlers and caretaker off-spinner Baba Aparajith has been his most successful bowler to date
 unhone chah over main 26 ran dekar do wicket liye
 Hanuma Vihari also picked up a wicket in one over
 unke alaava captain aar vinayakumar, ech es sharat, pragyan ojha or shreyas gopal ko bhi ek ek wicket mila he
 The central region started very slow and alert in the morning
 faij fazal or jalaj saxena ne yah sunishchit karne kii koshish kii dakshin kshetra ke tej gendbaaj subah kii nami kaa phayda nahin uthaa paayen
 The middle-zone opening pair only focused on flaring the ball and the result was that only 14 runs were scored in the first 15 overs, and in the 18th over, when Vinaykumar took a light edge of Jalaj's bat, the wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik's gloves took over
 So there were just two runs off 43 balls in front of his name
 bisht ne bhi shuru main satarkta barti lekin jaise hi unhen pragyan ojha kii dhili gend mili use unhone chakke ke liye bhej diya
 Bisht made some attractive shots after this, which also increased Fazal's confidence and he also got runs, which led to the central area reaching 34 for one wicket in 34 overs till lunch
 dakshin kshetra ke captain vinayakumar ne pehle satr main hi gendbaaji main lagaataar badlaav kiye or saat gendbaaj aajamaaye
 After lunch, he kept the stand-off off-spinner Aparajith from one end who was handed the ball just before lunch
 fazal unke jhaanse main aa gayi
 His cut on the short pitch ball going to the backfoot was converted into a catch by Hanuma Vihari standing at the point
 is tarah se fazal ek ran se ardhashatak se chook gayi
 He played 127 balls in his innings and hit seven fours
 ab sabhi kii nigaah naman ojha par thi jo pichley kuch maichon se lagaataar bade score bana rahe the
 He hit Aparajith with a beautiful cover drive but he could not make the right shot in an attempt to drive the next ball and Vinaykumar dived and caught the valuable wicket for South
 aparajit ke ek over main do wicket nikalne se score teen wicket par 94 ran ho gaya
 Bisht and Maneria added some relief to the central region by adding 68 runs for the fourth wicket
 in donon ne satarkta or aakraamakata donon tarah kaa ravaiya apanaaya or keval dhili gendon par bade shot khele
 Meanwhile Bisht completed his half-century off 104 balls
 abhimanyu mithun jab round da wicket gendbaaji ke liye aaye to maneria ne unke ek over main teen khubasurat chauke jade
 Bisht also sent Shreyas Gopal's consecutive balls across the boundary line
 vinayakumar ne aise main hanuma vihari ko gend saunpane kaa jua khelaa jo kaamyaab rahaa
 Maneria proceeded to flick on his ball but the ball was caught by him and the rest of the work was done by Karthik
 gopal ne agle over main ravat ko out karke madhya kshetra ko phir se baikfoot par bhej diya
 Gopal meanwhile harassed Bisht on one or two occasions, but his intended innings was ended by Pragyan Ojha
 unki middle stump par kii gayi gend bisht ke balle kaa kinaaraa lekar midwicket par kaich main badal gayi
 The Rajasthan batsman played 153 balls and hit 12 fours and a six
 ojha ne ghosh ko aate hi pavilion bhej diya hota lekin robin uthppa ne unka kaich chhod diya
 Chawla again showed his hands in batting, but the captain of the middle zone, playing his 100th first-class match, lost his wicket at the end of the day
 unhone sharat kii gend par drive kiya lekin uthppa ne is baar galati nahin kii or use kaich main badal diya
 Then the game of three overs was left but the umpires declared the day's play at the same time due to the lack of light
 (input bhashaa se) a former US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official said that Pakistan is probably the 'most dangerous country' in the world
 unhone pakistan kii ludhakti arthvyavastha, vahaan vyaapt aatankwaad or teji se badhate parmaanu shastraagaar vaale deshon main shaamil hone se paidaa huye sambhavit khatre kaa hawala diya

 ' halbert ne kaha, ‘ant main, haalanki pakistan vishwa main sabase khatarnaak desh nahin he lekin sambhavat: yah duniya ke liye sabase khatarnaak desh he
 There is a lot to be done in Pakistan today, but if we continue to isolate it or adopt a strategy of banning it will make the situation worse
 ’ unhone kaha ki america or imef ne kharbon rupee kii vittiya sahaayta di he kyonki pakistan kaa saaya america raashtrapati ko kisi anya desh ke mukaable adhik daraa rahaa he
 The comments unhone kaha, ‘ise dekhte huye ham paisa baha rahe hai, unhen acha vyavhaar karne ke liye koshish kar rahe hai lekin isse simit safalataa mili he lekin hamen ye koshishen jari rakhni chaiye
 Halbert said that the only real motive in Afghanistan today is to prevent the country from going into the hands of the Taliban and to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorists who may be plotting attacks against Western countries
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 Quoting The Hindu's report, Congress President Rahul Gandhi is continuously accusing the Modi government of a scam in this Rafale Deal and is also talking about benefiting Anil Ambani
 mangalvaar ko ek baar phir se rahul gandhi ne press conference kar modi sarkaar par hamalaa bolaa
 Rahul Gandhi said that it is now clear that there is a scam in the Rafale deal
 ek i-mail saamne aayaa he
 Prime Minister Modi was acting like Anil Ambani's middle man
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki anil ambani ne france ke raksha mantri ko saude kii jaankaree di
 That is, they already knew
 jabaki echeel, dephence ministar or videsh sachiv ko bhi yah nahin pataa tha
 The PM should tell how Anil Ambani came to know about it 10 days before the deal
 rahul gandhi nekaha ki pehle rafel main bhrashtachar kaa maamla tha, lekin ab oficial sicret act ke ulanghan kaa bhi maamla saamne aayaa he
 Rahul Gandhi also attacked Prime Minister Modi over the CAG report on the Rafale deal
 unhone kaha ki yah kaig nahin balki chaukeedaar auditor general report he
 Now there is no doubt in anyone's mind that PM is corrupt
 piem modi hi sab jaanate the or unhone anil ambani kii madad kii
 He said that the PM compromised with the security of the country regarding the defense secret
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki congress jabardast tareeke se apana kaam kar rahi he
 Now the public has to decide that neither Anil Ambani came to know about the deal about which neither the Defense Minister nor any other officer knew about it? i told the PM that you should investigate us or the leaders of the opposition, but also check Rafael
 jepisi gathit kariye, lekin kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 Rahul said that now a case of corruption, procedural and violation of Secret Act has come in the Rafale Deal

 After the introduction of Nav Durga, like the rural goddess here, reaching the temple and asking for vows

 The Bhajan Kirtan continues continuously
 alam yah he ki ilaake ke log us mandir or 'kutiya maharani' ke prati utani hi aasthaa dikhaa rahe hai, jitani duusare hindu devi devataaon ke prati dikhaate hai
 It is interesting for people to visit this temple

 This temple is built on a platform
 is mandir ko dekhakar chaunkna laazmi he
 The curiosity to know the history and recognition of the temple increases among the people who arrive here for the first time
 aakhir yahaan kisi 'kutiya' kaa mandir kyon banaaya gaya he
 The story behind this tells Shanti Devi of Revan village that the temple of Bitch is the center of faith of the people here
 kutiya maharani unki har manokamana puri karti hai
 It has been worshiped here for the last several years
 kai gaanvon ke log is mandir main puja karne aate hai
 The worship here on Dussehra and Diwali has special significance
 yah he mandir ke peeche kii kahani-yah ghatana kai saal puraani he
 a bitch was killed between Revan and Kakwara village of Mauranipur in Jhansi district
 sthaneey log bataate hai ki us samay gaanv main samuhik bhoj kii parampara thi
 There was a tradition of feeding a black bitch at the village banquet and people also feed her with full respect
 ek baar revan or kakvaara gaanv main ek hi din bhoj kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 At that time, Ramatula used to save the ancient instruments after every shift of the people sitting for food
 vahaan ke jaanavar bhi ramatula kii aawaaj sunakar vahaan pahunchakar khaanaa khaane pahunch jate the
 At the same time there was also a bitch who came close to the village of Revan after hearing the voice, when the Ramboola of Kakwara village survived and the instrument of food for food came from Revan village
 isi pashopesh main kutiya donon hi gaanv ke bhoj se vanchit rah gai
 Mangal Singh, the village elder, tells that the bitch was ill
 daudte-daudte thakkar donon gaanv ke bich main baith gai
 He died there due to hunger and disease
 gaanv ke logon ne kutiya ko usee jagah par jameen main dafan kar diya
 It is said that the place where he was buried was transformed into a stone
 logon ne ise chamatkaar mana or vahaan par ek mandir kii sthapana kar di
 Katri Devi of Kakwara village says that on the coming Diwali, worship is done here with pomp, because she died in these days
 yahaan maangane se har muraad puri ho jaati he
 Some people also consider it superstitious
 There is a lot of faith in this temple in two villages
 vahiin mauranipur ke kuch log ise andhvishwaas hi maanate hai
 Journalist Pramod Chaturvedi says that people quickly believe what others say
 is mandir ko bhukh se maut nahin hone or ghar main samruddhi laane kii muraad puri hone se jod diya gaya he, isiilie 'kutiya maharani' kii kahani par na sirf logon ne vishwaas kiya balki uski puja bhi shuru kar di gai
 This is superstition

 banaras main sitambar 2017 main jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bada lalpur main 200 karod kii laagat se taiyaar hue trade facilitation centre kaa udghaatan kiya tha to laga bunakaron ke ‘achche din’ aa gaye
 At that time the Prime Minister had said, "this center will open the way to the global market for small weaver brothers
 iske jariye kaashi ke hunar kaa parichay puri duniya ko milegaa
 "the question arises after about a year and a half, are weavers lucky? Weavers Faizal Sahid, a resident of Madanpur in Benares, says," Good days have come, but not from weavers, but some influential traders
 bunakaron se sari kharidkar oonche daam main bechakar bangaleru, mumbai, dilli or videsh tak yah log saadiyaan pahunchaate hai, lekin bunakar ko vahi daam miltaa he jo 5 saal pehle miltaa tha
 'faizal explains it in more detail, it takes four-five days to make a handloom sari
 kam se kam do log sari banane main jutate hai
 It costs around 6,000
 vyapaaree is sari ko 8,000 ru
 i buy it from a weaver and he gets it for at least Rs 15,000
 main banaras se baahar ke bade vyapaariyon ko bechata he
 Then the same reaches the sari and big businessman
 isaki keemat ab tak badhkar 25-28 hajaar ru
 It happens
 faijal kehete hai, trade centre kholane ke vakt pradhanmantri narendra modi ne chote-chote bunakaron kii dasha sudhaarney kii baat kahi thi
 There was talk of bringing his skills to the globe
 hunar to pahunch rahaa he
 But traders are not getting the price for the skill
 kabir chowk main rah rahi meharunishaan kahati hai, 'haath or powerloom donon kii baniin saadiyaan lekar main or mere shuhar pichley saal trade centre gaye the
 We felt that some way will tell how we can get good prices for our sarees? How to sell your sarees worldwide without middlemen? But there is no advice center there
 hamen bataaya gaya ki yahaan pradarshnee lagaai ja sakati he, lekin vah bhi kisi vyapaaree kii marfat hi lag sakati he
 Faisal says, if you go to take a Mudra loan to increase business, then this loan is not available without the recommendation of any leader
 banaras ke bheetar kisi chote bunakar ko koi lone nahin mila, jinhen mila ve vyapaaree varg ke hai
 What do the officials of the trade center say? On this charge of the weavers, Pradeep Yadav, carpet instructor officer at the Trade Facilitation Center, says, "we have 82 shops here
" inamen se 36 asthaayee dukaane (chah maheene ke liye) hai to 15 sarkari vibhaagon jaise gujarat handicraft and handloom department, khaadi gramodyog kii dukaane hai
 11 shops are permanent (leased for five years) shops
 17 dukaane abhi aavantit nahin hui hai
 How can a common weaver benefit from this? In response to this question, he says, the exhibition was held recently during the immigration program
 desh-videsh se log yahaan aae
 People of the world saw the work and crafts of Banaras, then people will know the skills of weavers
 pradarshnee main agar koi bunakar jagah lenaa chaahe to kaise le sakate hai? is sawaal ke jawaab main ve kehete hai, 'pradarshnee lagane vaali sansthaaon ko ham 50 fisadi riyaayat main jagah dete hai
 Further these institutions choose the weavers
 jab unase poocha gaya ki sansthaaen pradarshnee ke liye bunakaron ko kaise chunati hai to pradeep yadav ne anbhigyata jaahir kii
 Pradeep Yadav also says that now people hesitate to take shops here
 is vajah se 17 dukaane khaali padi hai or 36 dukaane asthaayee hai
 The special thing is that this temporary allocation of 36 shops was done a few days before the immigrant day, but gradually people will know its benefits
 haalanki pradeep yadav kii is safai par sthaneey patrakaron kaa kahana he ki event yaa phir narendra modi ke aane par hi yah trade centre sakriy hota he baaki yun hi padaa rahata he
 An official of the Trade Facilitation Center said, 'see when a work starts, it takes time for its results to come, in fact very few weavers come to take advantage of the center
 main aria se dur hona shaayad isaki vajah he
 'A few weavers came here and started shops here, but then they left because of reduced profits
 ve kehete hai, yahaan par zyada se zyada paryatakon ko khinchne ke liye hamane kai prayaas kiye
 Meetings were also held with many big hotel owners, but due to being away from the main area, tourists hesitate to come here

 There was news about the threat, under the direction of Vishal Sharma, Sunil Grover, the famous face of the TV world, whom you can not tell about Gutthi or doctor famous Gulati
 Are in the know, they are in the lead role in this film
 vaise to sunil ne iske pehle bhi kai hindi filmon jaise 'gabbar ij back', 'pyaar to hona hi tha', 'gajini', 'heropanti' ityadi main kaam kiya he

 Film Review: Bas Ok Ok Hai aditya-shraddha's 'ok Jaanu' Kahani: This is the story of Mumbai based news anchor Arnab Ghosh (sunil Grover) who hosts a prime time show in a news channel but the trps of the show keep falling
 Because of this, his boss Roy (rajesh Sharma) has given him 2 months to do anything and Arnab will not raise the TRP of the show, otherwise he will be shifted to non-prime time show
 is chintaa main jab arnab kii wif (anjana sukhaani) use anderworld don 'di' (jakir hossain) ke intervyuu kaa edia detii he jise arnab apane bos ko bataata he or wo haa kah detaa he
 Now there are many twists and turns in the story and finally Arnab arrives to interview Don with his team
 aage kya hota he iskaa pataa aapako film dekhakar hi chalegaa
 After the threat of the underworld, 'gutthi' release of the film Tillikamjor Kiyaan: The film thinks it is good that a news anchor goes to interview the underworld don for TRP but the writers have failed to write the entire screenplay accurately, Because of which, that thing does not come out in the filming
 film dekhte vakt kai saare shabdon par sensor kii kanchi bhi chali he or kuch jagahon kii dabing bhi sahi tareeke se nahin ho paayi he jisaki vajah se kahani kaaphi adhuri or ajeeb si lagati he
 There was a lack of budget in the film, due to which the production value seems quite light and weak
 film kaa sangeet thik thaak he lekin unke filmakan ke dauraan un gaanon se aap conect nahin kar pate hai
 The story of the film is very weak on which a lot of work should have been done
 film kii casting main jakir hossain, sunil grover, pankaj treepathi or rajesh sharma jaise harfanmaulaa actors hone ke baavjood bhi aap isse conect nahin kar pate hai or niraashaa hi haath lagati he
 Film Review: 'haramkhor' is a little funky and a little bourbon office: By the way marketing and promotion expenses are being said the budget of the film is around five and a half crores and the film's music and satellite rights are already sold out, so the film is If you will make up for the production cost, now it will be interesting to see how much profit the film makes

 In the preface of the book itself, he repeats a statement of Kovasji Jahangir, a distinguished Parsi citizen of Pakistan during Prime Minister Vajpayee's banquet, which is equally important in today's context
 jahangir ko aashcharya tha ki donon deshon kii vyavastha yah tathy kyon nahin samaj paa rahi he ki ‘nal main pani nahin he or atom bam bana liya he
 Will Hindustani and Pakistan eat bombs? ' He added, 'popular slogan is - Roti, cloth and houses

 And people from both sides talk nonsense - Kashmir, Line of Control

 Saharanpur sensation has affected the whole UP

 In this entire rift, the name of an organization is coming to the forefront, that is Bhima Army
 isaki sthapana dalit samudaay ke sammaan or adhikaar ko lekar kii gai he
 It was formed in July 2015 by advocate Chandrasekhar Azad
 is sanghathan kaa puraa naam 'bhim army bharat ekta mishan' he
 The Bhim Army first came into limelight after the April 2016 ethnic violence
 daliton ke liye ladaai ladane kaa daawa karne vaale chandrashekhar kii bhim army se aasapaas ke kai dalit yuva jud gaye hai
 Chandrasekhar says that the Bhima Army aims to protect the Dalits and get their rights, but for this he also claims to try every method, which is also against the law

 During this caste-based violence, police posts were burnt and 20 vehicles were set on fire

 The day after the incident, two police officers were transferred

 Proud of The Great Chamar, 30-year-old Chandrasekhar, who is leading the village-based Dalit community, claims that the Bhima Army is spread across seven states of the country including UP
 isamen kareeb 40 hajaar sadsy jude hue hai
 The center of this organization is Ghadkauli village of Saharanpur
 gaanv ke baahar ek sin board laga he
 Wrote on it- 'the Great Chamar Doctor Bhimrao Ambedkar Village Ghadkouli welcomes you
 ' daliton ke liye 'chamaar' shabd kaa istemaal jatisuchak aparaadh mana jaataa he
 It can also be punished
 yahaan 2016 main bhi hua tha jaateey sangharshavahin, ghadkauli gaanv ke dalit is shabd par etraj nahin balki garv mahasoos karte hai
 The Dalits of this village are not ashamed of their identity and their caste
 ek hajaar se zyada aabaadi vaale ghadkauli gaanv main 800 se zyada dalit parivaar rahete hai
 The result of the solidarity of the Dalits is that the villagers gave this village the name 'the Great Chamar', but for this name they also had to pay the price in the form of ethnic struggle in 2016

 There was a lot of ruckus in the village in April 2016, when a dispute arose over the same board of the village between two castes
 maamla jaateey hinsa tak pahunch gaya, jiske baad police dwaara lathi charge bhi kiya gaya
 The Dalits of this village continued to unite
 aaj bhi nahin bhul pate ghadkauli kandaghadkauli cond aaj bhi gaanv vaale bhul nahin pate
 It is alleged that people belonging to other castes first painted this board named after the village with black ink and then also inked the grandson of Ambedkar's statue in the village
 gaanv waalon kaa aarope he ki yah sab dabangon dwaara kiya gaya or shikaayat par police ne bhi gaanv waalon kii nahin suni

 Anand, who was third in the World Blitz after Magnus Carlson and Sergey Karjakin, told PTI, 'it is a great feeling to be at the podium place in Rapid and Blitz as these are quite different formats
 is tarah kii spardhaa main keval ek game ganvaana ek badi uplabdhi he
 'he said,' One is 15 minutes plus 10 seconds, which is quite slow, which is like a half-hour game
 duusari teen minute or do second kii he, jo aap kah sakate hai paanch-saat minute kaa game hota he
 So there is a very different rhythm
 ek main acha karne kaa matlab yah nahin he ki duusare main bhi acha pradarshan ho
 Anand shared the photo by winning the medal, saying- this is for wife
 This was a tough year for Anand in which he got out early in the Chess World Cup in Georgia and he finished in the recent London Chess Classic
 Were, but towards the end of 2017 things suddenly changed
 is mahaan khilaadi ne kaha ki unhone donon toornament main acha pradarshan kiya or donon main acha karnaa adbhut ahsaas he kyonki unhone ek main acha pradarshan karne kii ummid kii thi
 Anand said, 'in both of them i reached the top on the last day
 rapid toornament 14wein daur kii jeet main hi meri pakad main aayaa jisamen maine alexandra griscuk ko haraaya tha
 The other day i played well in the blitz
 duusare din ke duusare half main hi maine acha karnaa shuru kiya
 Vishwanathan Anand's slow start to the World Blitz Championship, he said, "so for me it is fantastic
" haal main rapid or blitz donon main mere parinaam kharaab rahe or main inaki bharpai karnaa chahta tha
 To be fair, i thought i would do better in one, it was difficult to be in both
 isliye donon main acha karnaa shandaar he
 'anand also said,' There are very few people who have secured a podium place in both formats

 After the economic reforms, due to increasing opportunities in the private sector and lack of special recruitment in government jobs, the activities of these offices were reduced considerably and its employees became unemployed

 tiwari kehete hai, ‘berozegaron ko bhatta dene kii bajaae unhen rojgaar ke laayak bananaa zyada jaruri he
 Economists and politicians may differ on the rationale of unemployment allowance, but the cycle of sp's expectation has also raised hopes of unemployed youth
 ab baari netaaon kii he ki ve ise na keval puraa karen balki barkaraar rakhen
 They should also understand that the real need of the youth is employment and not an allowance

 Samantha said that she hates Lamb

 The quarter-final stage of the World Cup has brought India and Bangladesh to such a point, from where the path leads and also returns
 yani ek team semifinal kii raah pakadegi or duusari ghar kii
 India, who have not lost a single match in this World Cup so far, are confident of their victory in Melbourne, but the history of the World Cup against Bangladesh is not allowing them to take this match lightly
 2011 ke vishwacap main bharat ne bangladesh ko usee kii jameen par dhul chataa di thi, lekin 2007 main neutral venue (westeindies) par bangladesh se harkar world cap se baahar hone kaa dard aaj bhi team india ko salata he
 Bangladesh has once again raised the alarm bell after a win over a team like England in this World Cup
 ek baar phir world cap kii nokout stage saamne he, ek baar phir muqabla neutral venue par he or ek baar phir daanv par worldcup he
 Let's take a look at what will happen in this competition
 aankadon main team india awwalbharat or bangladesh ke bich ab tak kul 28 antarrashtriya mukaable khele gaye jinamein se 24 main bharat jeeta he or 3 main bangladesh, ek muqabla benatija bhi rahaa
 The two teams have clashed 6 times on the neutral venue, out of which India has won 5 times and Bangladesh 1 time
 ye ek haar bharat ko world cap 2007 main mili thi
 Talking of World Cup matches, both the teams met face-to-face 2 times and both were winners once
 nock out maichon main bharat kaa muqabla nahinisisi ke kisi bhi bade toornament ke dauraan jab bhi team india nock out stage par pahunchi he, to usne apana sarvshereshth khel dikhaaya he
 Statistics say that India has won 2 out of 3 matches whenever India had to play knock out during the World Cup, Champions Trophy and World T20 Championship
 kul milakar bharat 24 baar aise mukaable khelaa, jinamein se 16 baar use jeet mili he, 6 baar haar mili or 2 baar match kaa nateeja nahin niklaa
 On the other hand, Bangladesh has never reached the knockout stage till date
 maujuuda form bharat ke sathbharat ne lig round main apane sabhi 6 match jite
 Indian batsmen 53 in the league round
 48 ran prati wicket ke ausat se ran banaae, joki lig stage main sarvshereshth ausat rahaa
 During this time Indian batsmen also played 6 century partnerships
 unase zyaada 7 shatkeey saajhedaariyaan srilanka ke naam raheen
 In this World Cup, the only team that has done the work of getting their opponent all out in every match, also belonged to India
 yahi nahin, apane pool main bhartiya gendbaajon kaa iconmi rate 4
 It was 72, which was the best
 lig daur main prayek wicket ke liye team india ke gendbaajon ne 20
 Spent 52 runs which was the lowest compared to the rest of the teams in his pool
 sabase zyaada 19 madan over daalane ke maamle main bhi bharat apane pool main top par tha
 In the league stage, Team India was at the forefront in terms of scoring the most players from the opposing team and also for taking the most catches
 ballebaajon kii hogi tackarrohit sharma or ravindra jadeja ko chhodkar team india ke sabhi ballebaaj form main dikhaai de rahe hai
 Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ajinkya Rahane took Team India to the door of victory in some match, but Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja disappointed most of the matches
 openar ke taur par rohit sharma kaa flop sho team india ko pareshaan kar rahaa he, to jadeja ne 6 maichon main abhi tak sirf 18 ran hi banaae hai
 Nevertheless, Team India can consider batting as their strength before this match
 team india ke ballebaajon kaa bangladesh ke khilaaf record bhi behad shandaar he
 On the other hand, both Virat and Raina have an average and strike rate above 100 against Bangladesh
 haalanki bangladesh ke ballebaajon ne bhi lig daur main jamkar dhamal machaaya he
 Mahmudullah has scored 344 runs in 5 innings at an average of 86, including his 2 centuries
 unke alaava mushafikur rahim, shaakib al hasan or sabir rahamaan bhi apni team ke liye damdaar ballebaaji kar rahe hai
 Bowlers will speak In the Hallis World Cup, both the bowlers of Team India and Bangladesh have won for their respective teams
 bharat kii taraf se mohammad shami 5 maichon main 15 wicket chatka chuke hai, to aswin ko 6 maichon main 12 wicket mili hai
 Mohit Sharma and Umesh Yadav have also gone 10–10 in 6 matches
 udhar, bangladesh ke liye bhi shaakib-al-hasan, rubell hossain or captain mashrafe murtaja kii tikdi bhi virdohi ballebaajon ko pareshaan kar rahi he
 Bangladeshi bowlers wreaked havoc against England
 haalanki melbern kii pich tej gendbaazon ko zyada saport karti rahi he, lekin pich par maujuud bouns spinners ke liye bhi kuch naa kuch jarur rakhti he
 There will also be bets, this match will be very special for Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the captain
 agar bharat, bangladesh ko haraata he to captain dhoni kii ye 100veen van-de jeet hogi
 He will be the third captain to do so after Ricky Ponting (165 wins) and Alan Border (107 wins)
 bangladesh ke liye bhi ye match behad khaas he
 This will be his 300th one-day international match
 2004 main bangladesh ne apane 100wein antarashtriya match main bharat ke khilaaf or 2009 main apane 200wein antarashtriya match main westeindies ke khilaaf jeet darj kii thi
 Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza is also awaiting the match
 bharat ke khilaaf bangladesh ne jo teen van-de jite hai, mashrafe murtaja un teenon maichon main bangladesh team kaa hissaa the
 He also became the man of the match in two of them

 On the one hand, the government of the Aam Aadmi Party makes big claims from the safety of women to their betterment
 duusari taraf sarkaar mahilaon se jude kai NGO ko puri tarah nazarandaaj kar rahi he

 satta main aane ke baad se hikejariwal sarkaarmahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar centre sarkaar ko nishaanaa bana rahi he
 The AAP government claims that it will provide a safe environment for women after the Delhi Police comes under the state government
 lekin yahaan pehle se mahilaon ke liye maujuud NGO kii taraf dhyaan nahin diya ja rahaa he
 In fact, the responsibility of the Women's Helpline of the Delhi Women's Commission has been given to 5 ngos in 11 districts, while the number of such ngos running on rape related cases is 7
 kai NGO mahila panchayat yojana bhi chalaate hai, jiske tahat mahilaon ko dahej pratha, chhedchhad or balaatkaar ke alaava baaki samasyaon ke liye jaagruk kiya jaataa he
 But NGO operators complain that they have not been paid the amount for the last 8 months, which is affecting all these schemes
