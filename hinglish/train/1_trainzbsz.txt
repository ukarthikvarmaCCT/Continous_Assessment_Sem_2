 ab baaji palat gai he
 Musharraf is in jail and after 14 years, Nawaz Sharif is in this position, where he can ask what should be done with you
 miyaan musharraf bade armaan lekar pakistan aae the
 Nawaz Sharif had dreams once again in the eyes of Pakistan's rule
 un navaj sharif ko jinaki sarkaar kaa 1999 main takhtapalat kiya tha parvej musharraf ne
 Even as the government went, Nawaz Sharif had to leave the country
 ab navaj sharif ke haath main hukumat he, miyaan musharraf ko talashna bhi nahin he, wo to deshadroh ke iljaam main jail main hi hai, lekin ab aage kya hoga
 It will not be easy for Nawaz Sharif to forget the enmity which was laid 14 years ago
 musharraf or navaj kii dushmani shuru hui thi 1999 se
 Nawaz Sharif was then the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the command of the army was in the hands of Pervez Musharraf
 kargil yuddh se pehle donon ke rishte bhi kaaphi achche the lekin mishan kargil flop hone ke baad donon ek duusare ko pad se hataane kii firaaq main jute gaye the
 Rumors of a coup started flying in Pakistan
 isi bich parvej musharraf srilanka sena kii 50veen saalagirah ke samaaroh main shaamil hone colombo gaye
 On October 12, Musharraf was returning from Colombo to Karachi, but his plane was not allowed to land at Karachi Airport
 ye aadesh pradhanmantri navaj sharif ke daftar se diya gaya tha
 In a hurry, Nawaz Sharif also declared Khwaja Ziauddin as the new army chief, but by then Musharraf's loyal army had left from Rawalpindi and he soon put Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif under house arrest
 navaj ne aakhri chaal chali or karachi airport par aadesh diya ki musharraf ke vimaan ko bharat bhej diya jaae lekin yahaan bhi unka pasa ulataa palat gaya, airport par bhi sena kaa kabja ho chukaa tha
 On the night of 12 October 1999, there was a coup in Pakistan
 janata kii chuni hui sarkaar satta se bedakhal ho gai or pakistan par ek baar phir fouj kaa hukumat kabiz ho gai
 Musharraf declared himself as the Chief Executive of Pakistan and took command and suspended the Constitution and declared Emergency
 takhta palat ke baad navaj sharif ko ek sarkari guest house main najarband kar diya gaya or lahore sthit unke ghar ko janata ke liye khol diya gaya
 Nawaz was tried for kidnapping, attempted murder and treason
 march 2000 main anti terarysm court main navaj sharif kaa trial shuru hua
 Nawaz Sharif was kept in Adiala Jail, this is the same jail where Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was tried and then hanged in 1979
 navaj sharif ke trial ke dauraan hi unke vakil kii goli markar hatya kar di gayi
 The incident aggravated the panic
 puure pakistan main ye khabaren udi huin thi ki ye mukadmaa to ek dikhaava he, faujee hukumat navaj sharif ke saath vahi karne vaali he jo 1979 main general jiyaul haq ne julfikaar ali bhutto ke saath kiya tha
 According to sources in Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf and his military officers were also in this right
 lekin saudi arab or america, navaj sharif ko chhodane ke liye lagaataar dabaav banaae hue the
 In December 2000, the court was about to deliver a verdict that Nawaz Sharif had a deal with Musharraf and under the agreement Nawaz Sharif left the country with his entire family and moved to Saudi Arabia
 14 saal baad pakistan main navaj sharif kii nai pari shuru ho rahi he
 Watch the game of destiny Now Musharraf is imprisoned in the house and he too has many charges including treason
 fark bas itnaa he ki 14 saal pehle faisla musharraf ne kiya tha ab baari navaj sharif kii he

 20 Panchs and Sarpanches resigned in Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir citing threat of life
 jammu-kashmir ke sopor ilaake ke panchon va sarpanchon ne media ke saamne apane istife kii ghoshnaa kii
 Sarpanch Manjoor Ahmed of Hardshiva Sopore said, 'we are afraid of our lives and therefore we are resigning
 ’gauratlab he ki mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne panchayat sadasyon par hamalon ko dekhte hue suraksha vyavastha kii samiksha kii he
 The impact of demonetisation is also clearly seen in the famous Sonepur fair which lasts for a month in the Sonpur area of historical, religious and mythological importance at the confluence of the Ganges and the Gandak River in Bihar
 meley main har varsh kii bhaanti is varsh bhi khilone, khel-tamaasha or pashuon kaa bazaar sajaa he, parantu in saamaanon ke kharidaar nahin aa rahe
 Every year lakhs of domestic and foreign tourists reach this fair, which starts a day before Kartik Purnima
 yah mela aaj asia ke sabase bade pashu meley ke rup main vikhyath he
 This world famous fair is fully prepared, but there is disappointment among the shoppers coming from outside
 meley kaa aupchaarik udghaatan 12 november ko hi ho chukaa he, lekin karthik poornima ke din se hi yahaan mela dekhne waalon kaa rela umadta he
 It is said that one can get needle to elephant in this fair
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 8 november kii aadhi raat se 500 or 1000 rupee ke noton par pratibandh laga diya
 It is noteworthy that in this fair people do not shop with atms and credit cards
 uttar pradesh ke baliya se khilonaa bazaar main aae parashuram singh pichley 30 varshon se yahaan khilone kii dukaan lagaate aa rahe hai, lekin is saal unhen phayda najar nahin aa rahaa
 He said, 'in the past years, three to four thousand toys were sold every day from the day of full moon
 is baar pratidin 500 rupee ke khilone bechnaa bhi mushkil ho rahaa he
 ' jammu evam kashmir se garm kapade lekar aae mohammad firoz bhi is varsh meley se naakhush hai
 According to Feroze, due to less interest of buyers, they have to keep the price of their warm clothes down, yet buyers are not coming
 unka kahana he ki aisa nahin he ki log yahaan nahin aa rahe
 People are coming to the fair, but the fair is rotating and going back, not shopping
 meley ke pashu bazaar main notebandi kaa asar saaf taur par dikh rahaa he
 Subodh Rai, an animal trader from Dighwara in Saran district, says, 'we are very upset
 500 or 1000 rupee ke puraane note koi nahin le rahaa
 If you are going to buy cows, people are asking for 'nayaka' notes
 is kaaran se yahaan gaay bahut kam he
 ' idhar, gaanvon se aane vaale auto or mini bason par bhi yatriyon kii sankhya kam he
 An auto driver told that in other years special bus, including auto, for Sonepur fair at 10 to 20 minutes from other Chowk intersections including Kathara, Karauna, Block Headquarters, Mustafapur, Khajichand Chapra, Sumerganj, located on mahua-muzaffarpur main road Other carts were available
 parantu is varsh notebandi ke kaaran logon main utpann aarthik samasya ke chalate meley main jane vaale logon kii sankhya main kami ai he
 The comments vahiin, meley main patna se aae chuudi vyapaaree akaash ne ummid jataai ki sab thik ho jayega
 Akash said that it was a matter of two-four days
 sthiti thik ho jaaegi
 Just five days have passed since the fair started
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) prayek varsh karthik poornima se ek din pehle shuru hone vaale is meley main lakhon deshi or videshi paryatak pahunchate hai
 This fair is known today as Asia's largest animal fair
 vishwa prasiddh yah mela puri tarah saj-dhaj kar taiyaar he, lekin baahar se aane vaale dukandaaron main maayusi he
 The fair has been formally inaugurated on November 12, but from the day of Kartik Purnima, the fair of the fair is seen here
 kaha jaataa he ki is meley main sui se lekar hathi tak miltaa he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned 500 and 1000 rupee notes from midnight on 8 November
 ullekhneey he ki is meley main log atm or credit card se kharidari nahin karte
 Parshuram Singh, who came to the toy market from Ballia in Uttar Pradesh, has been setting up a toy shop here for the last 30 years, but this year he does not see any benefit
 unhone kaha, 'beete saalon main poornima ke din se hi pratidin teen se chaar hajaar ke khilone bik jate the
 This time it is also difficult to sell toys worth 500 rupees per day
 ' Mohammad Feroz, who brought warm clothes from Jammu and Kashmir, is also unhappy with the fair this year
 firoz ke mutabik, kharidaaron kii kam dilchaspee ke kaaran unhen apane garm kapadon kii keemat kam rakhni padi he, phir bhi khariddaar nahin aa rahe
 He says that it is not that people are not coming here
 meley main log aa rahe hai, parantu mela ghumkar waapas ja rahe hai, kharidari nahin kar rahe
 The impact of demonetisation is clearly visible in the fair's cattle market
 saaran jile ke dighavaara se aae pashu vyapaaree subodh raay bataate hai, 'ham log bahut pareshaan hai
 Nobody is taking old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees
 gaay kharidne ja rahe hai to log 'nayaka' note maang rahe hai
 For this reason there is very little cow here
 ' Here, the number of passengers on autos and mini buses coming from villages is also less
 ek auto chaalak ne bataaya ki anya varsho main mahua-mujffarpur mukhya maarg main avasthit katahaaraa, karauna, prakhand mukhyalay, mustafapur, khajechand chhapra, sumerganj sahit anya chowk chauraahon se 10 se 20 minute ke antaraal par sonpur meley ke liye vishesh bas, auto sahit anya gaadiyaan milti thim
 But this year there has been a decrease in the number of people going to the fair due to economic problems caused by people due to demonetisation
 tippaniyan At the same time, Akash, a Bangle merchant from Patna, expressed hope that everything will be alright
 meley main chudiyaan ke dukaan lagaae akaash ne kaha ki do-chaar dinon kii baat he
 The situation will be fixed
 abhi to mela shuru hue paanch din hi gujarey hai

 lihaaja jab india today conklev ne saarvajanik bhaashan ke japani tareeke pechaa kucha se taaruf karavaaya- jisamen kul 6 minute or 40 second tak 20-20 second kii 20 sliden dikhaai jaati hai-to narendra modi sarkaar ke chaar mantriyon ne sabit kar diya ki ve nae vichaaron or tareekon ke hisaab se apane ko dhaalane main kaaphi paarangat hai
 In the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Modi had often put forward his vision of developing India in four important areas
 ye chaar kshetra the-railway, sadak-parivahan, bijli or rajkaaj main aasaani
 Two years later, the India Today Conclave-2016 was a chance to test his work in these four important areas
 isamen unke chaar saathi mantriyon- rail mantri suresh prabhu, sadak or parivahan mantri nitin gadakari, bijli or koyala rajya mantri piyush goyal or vaanijya rajya mantri nirmala sitaraman-prekshkon par apni chhap chhodane main kaamyaab rahe
 At least with his sharp and sharp pecha kucha presentation, he could do so
 aadhe ghante ke tej raftaar slide sho ke do khaas theme the-yojanaon ko anjaam dene par lagaataar dhyaan or modi kii nigaraanee tathaa or zyada hasil karne par jor
 However, he knew very well that questions would be raised regarding the speed of completion of the work, so he had kept the excuse of upa's legacy ready
 jahaan gadakari ne daawa kiya ki unhen 403 deree se chal rahi or 730 thap padi hui yojanaayen viraasat main mili hai, to goyal ko is baat kaa ranj tha ki jab unhone kaam sambhala tab 18,452 gaanvon ke 33 karod log bagaiyr bijli ke andhere main rah rahe the
 But if these ministers are to be believed, neither they are going to be intimidated by such huge challenges nor will they be distracted by the allegations that the pmo's totalitarian rule operates in the NDA government
 sarkaar ke kaam karne ke tareeke kii ek virali andruni jhalak dete hue sadak-parivahan mantri gadakari or bijli-koyala rajyamantri goyal ne khulaasa kiya ki virodh or asahmatiyaan cabinet kii baithkon kii do sthaayee khaasiyaten hai, magar faisle hameshaa sabaki rajamandi se desh ke hit main liye jate hai
 During their presentations, the ministers said that Goyal has to listen to the most hesitation and Gadkari speaks the most with a strong show of facts and figures, while the Prime Minister is very tolerant of debate and discussion on new ideas, but the inefficiency But they are not even tolerant and want results within the time limit
 samaybaddh nateezon par itnaa jor die jane kii vajah se ve nae-nae tareekon or vichaaron ko parakhane or paripaatiyon se hatakar kaam karne ke liye majaboor hue hai
 Railway Minister Prabhu sees tremendous potential to earn revenue from advertising in rails carrying 7 billion passengers a year; Gadkari plans to replicate the success of biofuels in Nagpur in 1 lakh cities across the country; While Goyal wants to use his expertise as an investment banker to tap non-traditional sources to raise funds, Nirmala Sitharaman promised to open 70 incubation centers across the country to promote start-ups
 or apane-apane mishan ko puraa karne ke liye ve laal feete ke jaal main ulajhna nahin chaahate
 Therefore, Prabhu and Goyal take the decision of the Ministry of Power's participation in the railway budget only in a telephone conversation

 The US president read several tweets made by Donald Trump, the last of which was, "president Obama will be recorded as possibly the worst president in US history
" 
 
 " Obama responded to this during the show and said, "at least i will be recorded as President
 
 
 " Kimmel also mocked Donald Trump's statement on the show, in which he has been saying that he will be rigged against the November 8 election
 kimail ne kaha ki obama ko sho main aane ke liye 'chunaav main dhaandhlee main madad karne ke kaam se vakt nikaalnaa padaa hoga
 
 
 ' baraak obama ne bhi is bayaan kaa mazaaq udaaya, or bataaya ki obamakare health insurance kaa prachaar karne kii khatir taiyaar kiye gaye ek stant ke liye kamedian bill mare ne ovel offis main ek gilaas main golf kii gendon ko daalane ke khel main unhen haraa diya tha
 Obama laughingly said, "he (bill Murray) won again and again
 
 
 gilaas ke saath dhaandhlee kii gai thi
 
 
 " kimail ne obama se sawaal kiya, kya aap donald trump ko tivi par dekhte hue "kabhi hansate hai
 
 
 "obama said in response," more often
 
 
 " Barack Obama also said that during his tenure, he had been called 'three-four times' on special phones, including after the tsunami that struck Japan in 2011, even after he went to bed at midnight when emergencies arose
 Chance is also included, but mocking Donald Trump, he said that he does not pick up his smartphone in the early hours
 unhone kaha, "main subah 3 baje un logon ke bare main twit nahin karata, jinhone meraa apmaan kiya
 
 
 " baraak obama kaa doosraa or antim kaarykaal 20 janvari ko khatm hone ja rahaa he
 According to the US Constitution, it is possible for any person to have two terms as the US President, which according to Obama is absolutely justifiable

 In Khurshid Kasuri's book, 'naider a Hawk, nor a Dove', there is a discussion of similar secret meetings between India and Pakistan at diplomatic level
 kasuri kii kitaab main general musharraf ke hawaale se likhaa gaya he ki vah kashmir par gupt samjhaute ke tahat rajya par donon deshon kaa sanyukt prabandhan chaahate the

 naam savita yadav, umr 33 varsh
 The snake bites this woman more than 60 times, but the shadow of death never reached her
 ye kisi patakatha kii panktiyaan nahin hai, balki madhya pradesh ke tikamgarh jile kii us mahila ke jindagi kii hakeekat he, jise saal main kai baar saanp ke dansh kaa shikaar bananaa padataa he
 Panchampura village is close to Mohangarh Panchayat of Tikamgarh
 yahaan rahane vaali savita kii pahchaan sarpdanshita ke rup main ban chuki he
 Savita was first bitten by a snake when she was 19 years old
 uske baad se har varsh ausatan chaar se paanch baar saanp use dasata he, magar kudarat ke karishme ke chalate maut use chooti nahin he
 Savita tells that the night she sees a snake in her dream, she realizes that soon the snake can come close to her and bite her
 aisa hota bhi he
 She says that not even once did it happen that the snake appeared in the dream and it did not bite
 itnaa hi nahin, jab use saanp katata he to lalitpur kaa ek ojha hi use hosh main laa paata he
 The 60 marks made on the body of Savita of the laboring family tell the story of the snake bites
 haath va sharir ke hisse main saanp ke dase jane ke nishaan dikhaate hue savita bataati he ki saanp ke daste hi vah behoshee kii haalat main aa jaati he or parivaar ke log use ojha ke paas lekar bhaagate hai
 When he regains consciousness, he has weakness for several days
 uskaa daawa he ki use baar-baar ek hi saanp dasata he
 Savitha's husband Rajdhar says that it is not that the snake bites him only when he lives in Panchampura village
 vah panchampura se baahar bhi hoti he to use vahaan bhi saanp kaa nishaanaa bananaa padataa he
 Some people in the village relate this incident to reincarnation
 unka kahana he ki savita pichley janm main us saanp ke kareeb rahi hogi, jo use is janm main dasata he
 In this birth, both are different
 jaan-pahchaan ke kaaran hi vah savita ke paas aata he
 People tell different stories about why the snake bites Savita and why the poison does not affect her

 Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan may become the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
 british media ke anusaar unka naam is pad ke liye daud main sabase aage chal rahaa he
 The UK Foreign Ministry is being demanded to support the name of an Indian this time, after which Rajan's chances have become very strong
 imef ke emdi pad kii daud main rajan ke alaava bank of england ke purv governor mark karni, david camerun sarkaar main chancelar rah chuke jorge osborn or netherland ke purv vitt mantri jeroin dijascelbloem kaa naam bhi chal rahaa he
 Significantly, Christine Lagarde, the outgoing MD of the International Monetary Fund, resigned last week
 unka istipha 12 sitambar se prabhavi hoga
 According to the Hindustan Times, Christine Lagarde is going to be the president of the European Central Bank
 iske pehle is baat kii bhi kaaphi charchaa thi ki raghuram rajan ko bank of england kaa governor banaaya ja saktaa he
 Rajan, however, denied this and said that he had not applied for the post
 yah maang badhati ja rahi he ki is baar IMF kaa pramukh europe or america se baahar kisi vyakti ko banaaya jaae
 Britain's Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Tim Tugendhat wrote this letter to Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt, and according to the newspaper Sunday Times, 53-year-old Rajan seems to be the strongest contender
 sande times ke iconomic editor david smith ne likhaa he, 'yah bilkul uchit samay he ki yah pad kisi ubharate bazaar vaale candidet ko mili
 Raghuram Rajan, former Governor of India's central bank, is apt for this, as he was a former economist
 rajan philhal chicago uniwarsity main professor he
 Raghuram Govind Rajan was the 23rd Governor of the Reserve Bank of India
 unka janm 3 farvari 1963 ko bhopal main hua tha
 D
 on 4 September 2013
 subbarao ke ritair hone ke baad unhone yah padbhaar grahan kiya or sitambar 2016 tak is pad par rahe
 Earlier, he was Principal Economic Advisor to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during the UPA Government and Eric J
 at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business
 glichar finance ke eminent sarvice professor rah chuke hai
 From 2003 to 2006 he was the Chief Economist and Research Director of the International Monetary Fund
 bharat main vittiya sudhaar ke liye yojana ayog dwaara niyukt samiti kaa netritv bhi unhone kiya
 In 1985, he earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi
 im ahmedabad se unhone 1987 main emb kiya or masachusets institute of technology se 1991 main unhone arthshaastra vishay main piechdi kii
 In Bihar, as Congress became part of the power in the state by becoming nitish-lalu's backstage, all the leaders and Congress spokespersons were not tired of making a strategy to go to the grand alliance to promote Rahul's campaign as a big reason for victory
 rahul kii shaan main kaside padhe ja rahe the ki unhone modi kaa rath bihar main rokane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 The extent was reached when State President Ajay Maken gave the credit to Rahul Gandhi for winning 4 out of 13 seats in the Delhi Municipal Corporation by-election on May 17, but he might have forgotten that two days later, on May 19, 5 states Results are to come and if there is a defeat, how can the Congress hold Rahul responsible for the defeat
 maakan ne bhale hi apane number to alaakaman ke saamne badha liye, lekin 19 may ko congress ke media vibhaag or netaaon ke liye aisa sawaal chhod diya, jiskaa jawaab dene main sabake paseene chhot gaye
 Rahul is not responsible for the defeat
 For the last time, due to fever, Rahul Gandhi could not meet the media like the ill-fated Rahul Gandhi
 lekin twitor par unka sandesh aa gaya ki ham janata kaa faisla vinamrata ke saath sweekaar karte hai
 Thanks to the Congress workers, leaders and allies for working hard in the election, congratulations to the winners
 ham janata kaa vishwaas jeetne ke liye or mehnat karenge
 But when the Congress lost in 4 states, the Congress managers started preparing in such a way that the crown of the defeat does not blow the head of the Crown Prince Rahul Gandhi
 har rajya ke liye alag-alag daleelon ke saath congress ke netaa rajya se lekar dilli tak isi muhim main jute gaye
 Shashi Tharoor, a close aide of Rahul, opened the front at the beginning after the defeat in Kerala on the pretext to save Rahul, saying that we lost due to factionalism in the state and attempts to humiliate each other among the leaders
 tharur ne ek kadam or aage badhate hue kaha ki ab rajya ke saath hi rashtriya str parasanghathan main badlaavaki jarurat he
 It is wrong to blame Rahul for the defeat in the state, as the Lok Sabha elections are still 3 years away
 vahiin dopaher hote-hote media se mukhaatib hone aae kerala congress prabharee mukul vaasanic ne bhi rahul ko haar kaa jimmedaar maanane se inkaar karte hue kaha ki rajya main haar ke kaarnon kaa aankalan kiya jayega or phir badlaav kiye jaaenge
 The most interesting answer attributed to the Tarun Gogoi defeat came out for the defeat of Assam
 congress ke media prabharee randeep surajevaala ne pehle to haar kii jimmedaari rahul kii hone ke sawaal ko hi khaarij kar diya, phir tafsil se bataaya ki assam main sabase anbhavi mukhyamantri tarun gogoi ke netritv main congress ne chunaav ladaa, unheen kii raay par kuch chote dalon se gathjod hue or unheen kii raay par badaruddin ajmal se talmail nahin hua
 The election campaign and strategy remained the same, which the central leadership only supported
 saath hi 15 saalon kii anti inkambency ko bhi ek factor bataa diya gaya
 After the defeat in West Bengal, the Congress in-charge kept silence, after this the matter came to Bengal, where contrary to its ideology, the Congress entered into a pre-election alliance with the Left, yet could not stop Mamata from winning big
 yaad ho ki pichhali baar congress ne mamata ke saath milakar vidhansabha chunaav ladaa tha or vijayi gathjod kaa hissaa bani thi
 CP Joshi, who was in charge of Assam and Bengal, did not appear before the media to answer this
 ye vahi seepi joshi hai, jo bihar ke bhi prabharee the or vahaan jeet ke baad fouran media se mukhaatib hokar rahul ke sir sehara baandhne main jute the
 Congress's media in-charge Surjewala also defended Rahul for the Bengal debacle, asking whom to form alliances with in the state, it was decided according to the opinion of the state leaders and the desire of the workers
 rajya ke chunaav main prachaar kii ranneeti or mudde bhi pradesh congress ne tay kiye, isliye mahaj prachaar karne gaye rahul ko dosha dena thik nahin
 In the same way, the Congressmen do not forget to tell that after years, their leader will be the opposition in Bengal
 tamilnadu main bhi congress kii hardiemke ke saath tamilnadu main bichhadne ke baad vidhansabha chunaavon se thik pehle phir diemke kii bi team bani congress, jayalalita ke haathon phir haar gai to daleel bhi bengal jaisi hi ai
 It was said that the Congress was already weak in Tamil Nadu, so it was a political compulsion to tie up with the DMK at the behest of state leaders and activists
 vahaan haar mukhyarup se diemke kii hui he or jeet jayalalita kii, congress to mahaj ek chote sahyogi kii bhoomika main thi
 After the victory in Puducherry, after all the instructions on the celebration, there was some good news for the Congress from Puducherry with 30 assembly seats, where the Congress gained power
 lekin dilli main netaaon ko sakht hidaayat de di gai ki is jeet ke liye rahul-rahul kaa dhol naa peeta jaae varanaa chaar rajyon kii haar kii jimmdari bhi rahul par aan padegi
 However, on this victory in Delhi, Congressmen were seen walking on the party line
 lekin unako dar he ki nambar badhaane kii chahat main koi rajya kaa netaa rahul kii maala naa jap de or unki puri mehnat par pani naa phir jaae
 Although the Congress gives any reason, any strategy, but how can they forget that the captain gets accolades on the victory, then the same captain has to face criticism on the defeat

 The dynamic batsman of New Zealand has been watching the cricket world with full respect
 apni captaini main inhone 1992 main newzealand ko semifinal main jis andaaj main pahunchaaya tha, uski misaal aaj bhi di jaati he
 Whether it was a series of stormy batting in the initial overs (crowe had done this with fellow cricketer Mark Greatbatch) or in the form of spin bowling (trying Deepak Patel in the World Cup), it was all done by Crowe in 1992
 unke prayogon ke baad hi vanade cricket kii duniya fatafat se maramar cricket tak pahunchi

 In his column on the ESPN Cricinfo website, Crowe wrote - My life will no longer allow me to watch more matches and enjoy it

 Martin considers these two batsmen to be his sons and continues to say that these are two sons who have not been with me

 Physically as well as mentally, but the nervousness of these challenges may not be Martin Crowe

 The Congress is trying to unite opposition parties and form a grand alliance to defeat the Narendra Modi-led NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 haalanki is muhim main abhi tak congress ko bahut zyada kamyaabi nahin mil saki he
 This is the reason why two veteran leaders who once took charge of the bjp-led NDA are today trying to increase the clout of the Congress-led UPA to beat them
 andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu in dinon congress ke saath dushmani bhulaakar haath mila liya he
 They are trying to unite opposition parties and form a grand alliance

 In 2013, when the BJP announced Narendra Modi as the PM candidate, JDU split from the NDA
 iske chalate sharad yadav ko endie kaa sanyojak pad bhi chhodana padaa, jiske baad phir naidu ko iskaa jimmaa saunpa gaya tha
 Naidu was the NDA convenor from 2013 to 2017, but the TDP has parted ways with the NDA to demand special status for Andhra Pradesh
 ab naidu usee endie ko maat dene kii kavayad main jute gaye hai
 From SP to Mamta Banerjee and Sharad Pawar including Nitish Kumar have a better relationship
 aise main jis tarah se naidu in dinon lage hai dekhnaa he ki isamen kahaan tak kamyaabi pate hai
 In fact, the BSP has decided not to ally with the Congress in the five state assembly elections
 haalanki congress netaaon ko ummid he ki 2019 ke chunaav main basapa unke saath milakar chunaav ladegi
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party has also decided not to form an alliance with the Congress
 aise main naidu in donon netaaon ko saath laane main kitna safal rahete hai?naidu akele hi nahin sharad yadav bhi vipaksh ko ekajute karne main lage hai
 Sharad Yadav has also been the convenor of NDA

 The Patel community has become a sore throat for the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Gujarat assembly elections
 bijepi ke tamaam pantaron or ranneetiyon ko patidaar netaa hardik patel baikfoot par dhakelte dikhaai de rahe hai
 Dismissing reports of a split in the Patidars, Hardik Patel has made another major claim on Sunday
 hardik patel ne patidaaron main tut kii sargharmiyon ke bich ravivaar ko ek twit kiya
 In his tweet, he wrote that the two main organizations of Patidar, Khodaldham and Umiya Dham Unjha are our strength
 hardik ne kyon kiya twit?mana ja rahaa he ki hardik patel ne apane is twit se bijepi kii koshishon ko ek or jhatka diya he
 Actually, it is because this week, the six main institutions of the Patidars came together and the formation of the Patidar Core Committee was revealed
 in sansthaaon main umiya mataji santhaan oonja, khodldham kagvad rajkot, sardaar dham ahmedabad, vishwa umiya foundation ahmedabad, samast patidaar samaaj surat or umiya mata santhaan sidsar shaamil the
 According to media reports, the Patidars' reservation movement on behalf of these 6 institutions was described as Hardik's private movement
 saath hi bijepi sarkaar kii bhi tarif kii baat saamne ai thi
 Even the 'patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti' was targeted to 'private Anamat Andolan Samiti', targeting Hardik Patel
 lekin hardik ne in sabhi baton ko khaarij kar diya or patidaaron kii mukhya sansthaaon kaa samarthan hone kaa daawa kiya he
 Khodaldham had given the cleaning
 The President of Khodaldham Trust, Paresh Gajeri, himself also gave a public cleaning
 unhone kaha tha ki hardik patel ke khilaaf khodldham kii taraf se koi iljaam nahin lagaaya gaya he
 Paresh also denied Hardik's private movement
 hardik ke elaan ke mynehardik patel ne jin do sansthaaon ke samarthan kii baat kahi he, wo donon behad taqatvar hai
 Hardik Patel claims that 99 percent of Patidars believe these two institutions out of a total of 16 million Patidars in Gujarat
 yani patidaaron kii baaki sansthaaon kaa na koi khaas vajood he or na hi takat
 In the case of Khodaldham Khodaldham Kagavad in saurashtra-south Gujarat, this institution is considered to be very powerful in Saurashtra and South Gujarat
 in do ilaakon ke patel samudaay khodiar mata ko kuladevi maanate hai
 Kadva Patel, one of the two Patel communities of Gujarat, worships Khodiyar Mata
 matadaata kii drushti se dekha jaae to patidaaron ke kul voter main kadava patel kareeb 40 fisadi hai
 Which have a big impact on the seats in Saurashtra and South Gujarat
 uttar-madhya gujarat main umiya dham oonjhasouth or dakshin main jahaan kadava patel or unki sanstha khodldham kaa bada prabhaav mana jaataa he, vahiin gujarat ke baaki uttar-madhya hisse main leuva patelon kaa jor he
 Actually, in both these areas, Umiya Mata is considered as Kuldevi by people of Patel community
 jinka sanghathan umiya dham oonja he
 The Leuva community is about 60 per cent of the Patidar voters in Gujarat
 aise main umiya mata ko maanane vaale leuva patel chunaavon main behad nirnaayak bhoomika adaa karte hai
 Although these two communities of Patels have been the traditional BJP voters, this time the situation is different
 donon hi samudaay patel se aage badhkar ab patidaar ke binar tale andolan kar rahe hai
 Eating sticks and bullets on the demand for reservation has created a huge anger among the community among the BJP
 yahi vajah he ki hardik patel congress se apni maangon ko lekar deal kar rahe hai or baar-baar bijepi ko haraane ke daawey kar rahe hai
 The Congress also wants to overcome its two-decade-old political drought with the help of these
 dhaamon kaa mahatvagujrat kii raajnneeti main in dhaamon kaa kitna mahatv he, ise is udhaaharan se bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki narendra modi jab tak mukhyamantri rahe, wo har chunaav main khodldham mata ke saamne mattha techne jate the
 Although the upcoming elections are to be held in December, but Modi has not been there yet
 duusari taraf congress ne is baar jarur apane agenda main badlaav kiya he, jiske tahat rahul gandhi gujarat daure par mandiron kii sharan le rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi visited the Khodaldham Mata temple on a visit to Saurashtra and prayed
 isse pehle jab disambar 2016 main jab rahul gujarat gaye the, tab unhone umiya dham jaakar mattha teka tha
 Rahul's visit to both these shrines is also considered to be very important symbolically
 haalanki, hardik patel or congress ke bich abhi antim samjhauta nahin ho paaya he
 In such a situation, interesting political equations can be seen before voting on December 9 and 14

 Kamathipura of Mumbai is returning to a similar era, the bitter feelings and experiences embedded in it
 mumbai kii chakachaundh ke bich maujuud kamathipura, insaaniyat or samaaj donon ke chehron par hi ek jhannatedaar tamaacha he
 Asia's oldest red light area is sobbing in the lanes of Kamathipura, not knowing how many women are forced

 kyonki majaburiyon kii qabr par saji hai
 These celebrations of the Ayyashis
 us maahaul kii khanak main chupe dard ko samajhane ke liye zaruri nahin he ki aap ek shaayar hon yaa ek filosafar
 To understand this, you just have to be a human being
 kise nahin maaloom ki unki suuraton ne sajane se pehle apni sirat ko kuchlaa he
 Their bodies have suppressed their spirit before they start to fire
 unke tan ne machalane se pehle apane man ko ronda he
 Of course, the tinkle of their curls is hollow
 sex varkar yaa dancer kii majaburiyanlachariyon kii dahleez par saje is baagi jashn main khushiyaan nahin balki aakrosh he
 Inordinate resentment
 is aakrosh ko kamathipura kii sahami galiyon tak pahunchane se pehle hi mahasoos kiya ja saktaa he
 This road leads from Chor Bazaar to Kamathipura and the people reaching this path with staggering steps and passionate emotion
 apane dil kii dhadakanon main kisi khatare kii aahat ko mahusas karne ke baavjood naa jane kis talash main badhate jate hai sahami galiyon kii taraf
 9 street trade in Mumbai city where the dream market is populated

 Glamor de-glamorizes in Kamathipura in the same neighborhood
 sapane shishe kii tarah tuutate hai
 Whose character does not rhyme and sieve the soul

 The entire area of kamathipura is broadly divided into 16 lanes
 magar ab sex kaa kaarobaar yahaan sirf 9 galiyon main hi chalata he
 The streets decreased and customers increased
 The number of streets of Kamathipura may have decreased, but the number of people who took the streets of these streets continued to increase
 kuch itani ki yahaan padane vaale qadam tej bad nahin sakate or raftaar badhayen to kandhon se kandhe takaraane lagate hai
 For those who come to Kamathipura, there is so much trouble in the trick here that the eyes are ready to cheat even after seeing everything
 gali dar gali ghoomane ke baad bhi hasil kuch hota sa nazar nahin aata
 But the search is that she does not want to end
 isiliye naa ye bazaar khatm hota or naa hi yahaan aane vaale log
 It happens that there are innumerable and never ending stories in the same lanes of jisma
 un kahaniyon kii tah tak jane se pehle in galiyon ko pahchaanana zaruri he
 The most popular of these streets are secret
 yahaan se dhandha chalaane ke chaar tareeqe hai
 One of these ways is to have the sex worker direct talk to his client
 doosraa he dallalon ke zariye
 The third is extremely painful
 andheri kothriyon main band kam umraladakiyonke saath jabardastee kiya janaa
 And the fourth is to deal in a bar or a bar
 graahak se paisa einthna hi maksadakmathipura kii is tasviir par aap nigaah daalen to paaenge ki yahaan dukaane kisi bhi aam bazaar kii tarah sajati hai
 But if you look at these shops, then they will collide with those vents, from where unsafe lives of sex workers peep
 apni isi asuraksha ko dur karne ke liye ye sex varkar apane har lamhe kaa sauda kisi naa kisi graahak se karne kii firaaq main rahati hai
 Which can make his life somewhat safe
 aksar ye asuraksha unhen graahak se paisa anthne ke liye kuch bhi kar guzarane par amada kar detii hai
 Sex workers present themselves in such a way that sex workers are seen in different veneer and different styles with color lacquer and makeup
 apane aapako kisi sho cese main rakhe shopis kii tarah pesh karti hai
 They are looking for the customer and the customer is looking for a little time adventure
 lekin sachai ye he ki graahak kaa adventure to khatm ho jaataa he
 But the life of these sex workers becomes an adventure
 ek aisa jokhim bharaa adventure jisamen shaamil hai bimaariyaan
 Exploitation and the biggest enemy of this profession is old age
 tabutanuma kamaron se jhaankta shabaab kaa farebin galiyon ke kothe kisi local train jaise lagate hai

 har kisi ko mila dhokhadesh ke baaki redlite ariye main kaam kar rahi sex workaron kii tarah yahaan kii sex varkar kii kahani bhi vahi he
 Somebody got deceived in love
 koi naukari ke jhaansen main aa gai
 Some people showed the path of this soul to the family
 to kisi ko dalal ne paisa kamaane kaa ye rasta sujhaayaa
 The entry doors here can be different
 magar nikalne kaa raste ek bhi nahin he

 If the Rajasthan government and its bureaucracy do not sleep, it may have to be deprived of its billion-dollar property located in Delhi
 madhya dilli ke lutian jone main sthit bikaner house or uttari dilli sthit udaipur house kii paridhi main aane vaali jameen kii sarkari keemat hi kariban 169 karod ru
 It is made
 jabaki bikaner house kaa bazaar mulya anumaanit taur par 1,500 karod ru
 More than
 isi tarah dilli ke uparajyapal nivas ke nikat sthit udaipur house kii sarkari keemat (cirkil rate ke mutabik) kareeb 52 karod ru
 Whereas, the market price is about Rs 300 crore even in the current shabby conditions
 banati he
 But while the central government has ruled out any possibility of evacuating Bikaner House in future, the Delhi government is not ready to relinquish possession despite considering it to be the property of the Rajasthan government
 ab rajasthan sarkaar ke adhikari kehane lage hai ki centre sarkaar or dilli kii shila sarkaar kii niyat saaf nahin he
 In such a situation, the state government has no way but to go to the court
 lekin ashok gahalot sarkaar kii naukarshahi rajya ke hit main aawaaj uthaane tak kii jahamat nahin uthaa paa rahi
 An official attached to the state, on the condition of anonymity, says, "the government is writing only insistent letters, while political courage is needed to go to court against the government of its own party
" lekin rajya hit par party hit baari pad rahaa he
 "in 1977-78, the Shekhawat government took the key of evacuating the entire Bikaner house in a jolt, but later the center took over," says an official even commenting on Bhairon Singh Shekhawat
 
 '' jise ab centre sarkaar chhodane ko raji nahin he
 Union Minister of State for Urban Development Saugata Roy clearly says, "I do not see the possibility of vacating Bikaner House even in future
 ''haalanki sansad ke bajet satr ke dauraan saansad kirodi laal meena ke sawaal ke jawaab main loksabhaa main raay ne kaha tha, ''centre sarkaar apane vibhaagon ke liye daftaron kii kami kii samasya se jujh rahi he, isliye philhal bikaner house khaali karnaa sambhav nahin he
 "but now the central government is also mocking the Kumbhakarni sleep of the state government
" raay kehete hai, ''1954 se bikaner house centre sarkaar ke paas he or ab achaanak khaali karne kii baat kii ja rahi he
 How can we suddenly leave the occupation
 '' centre sarkaar kaa yah turra tab he, jab vah kiraye par liye gaye is bhawan kaa koi kiraaya tak adaa nahin kar rahi
 Thus, Rai denies any dispute over the rent, saying that no Chief Minister has ever filed such a complaint
 lekin rajya sarkaar ke adhikari kehete hai ki 1977-78 tak kiraaya mila, lekin uske baad na to dilli sthit awasaiya ayukta karyaalay yaa jaipur ke saamaanya prashasan vibhaag yaa peedbludi main koi kiraaya jamaa hua he
 According to government documents, the central government rented Udaipur House on January 21, 1951 and Bikaner House on May 15, 1954
 lekin centre ne 28 may, 1965 ko udaipur house dilli prashasan ko saunp diya
 There are more than half a dozen important buildings associated with Rajasthan in the capital of the country, including the Modern Art Gallery in Jaipur House located in central Delhi and now it is completely the property of the Central Government
 jaipur house ke bare main rajya ke ek adhikari kaa kahana he,''shivacharan maathur sarkaar ne kodiyon ke bhav mahaj paanch karod ru
 Sold to central government
 ''isi tarah, lutian dilli main hi sthit dhaulpur house main aazaadee se pehle se hi sangh lok seva ayog kaa daftar he
 The Kota House next to it, which was the palace of the ruler of Kota in the British Raj, is now occupied by the Navy

 rajasthan cader ke ek iees adhikari kehete hai,''ek baar nilaamee ke baad kuch log hathiyaar lekar aa gaye
 In such a situation how would any buyer buy this property
 ''in imaaraton se itar bikaner house or udaipur house ke liye rajasthan ko dohari ladaai ladani pad rahi he
 According to the reply given by the Central Government in Parliament, more than half the area of bikaner House, 32,191 sq ft, is still in its possession
 jabaki lambii ladaai ke baad centre ne 8 april, 1999 ko kuch hissaa khaali kiya, jiske baad 30, 133 squair feet main rajya sarkaar ke daftar chal rahe hai
 Vimal Sharma, Additional Resident Commissioner in Delhi, says, "it is just a built-up area, while there is also an open area of 80,000 square feet
" ''isi tarah dilli ke uparajyapal nivas ke nikat raajpur road par kothi number 15 jo kareeb 12,000 varg meter main failaa hua he
 The property is in the possession of the Delhi government, which till 2003 had the office of the Labor Department of the Delhi government, but since then the property has been in a dilapidated condition and the Sheila Dixit government is not ready to hand it over to Rajasthan
 udaipur house aaj puri tarah se jangal main tabdeel ho chukaa he, jo sthaneey nivaasiyon ke liye bhi kshtkaarak ban gai he
 Naveen Khanna, a consultant living next to this kothi, says, "due to lack of proper maintenance of the property, it has completely turned into a forest and poisonous creatures like snakes and scorpions come to our homes
 '' sthaneey nivasee kehete hai ki yah jarjar or janglenuma imaarat smakiyon kaa adda ban gaya he, jisase ilaake main choriyaan bhi khub hone lagi hai
 The Rajasthan government is now thinking of going to court to acquire this property
 kerala ne adalati ladaai jitkar travnakor house hasil kiya, punjab or anya rajyon ne bhi kanoon kaa sahaara lekar apni sampatti hasil kii he, jise dekhte hue rajasthan sarkaar ne bhi kanoonee adhyayan ke liye file sarka di he
 But it is not easy for the Gehlot government to go to court because the Congress government is at the center and in Delhi
 haalanki kanoonee ladaai se pehle rajasthan sarkaar main sampada maamalon ke rajyamantri bharosi laal jatav kehete hai,''dilli sarkaar ko agar civil lines sthit udaipur house prashasnic lihaaj se mufeed lag rahi he, to vah rakh le
 But in return, give any similar property to us in Chanakyapuri
 ''jabaki mukhyamantri gahalot chatravaas banavaane ke himachati hai
 "if even the Udaipur house is found, its administrative use will not be possible," says an IAS officer of the Rajasthan cadre, who has been replaced at the center
 aisi surat main use rajya se dilli vishvavidhyalay main padhane aane vaale chaatro ke liye chatravaas bananaa chahie
 "historically, Bikaner House is first in the list of heritage buildings of the New Delhi Municipal Council
 is imaarat main angrejon ke samay golmes sammelan hue, to aazaadee ke baad desh ke pehle grih mantri sardaar vallabh bhai patel riyasaton ke ekikaran kii meeting kar chuke hai
 But this heritage building was delivered in a dilapidated state by the central government
 centre ne 8 april 1999 ko jab mukhya satarkta ayukta (sivisi) vaala hissaa choda, tab bhi taatkaaleen rajya sarkaar ne dhyaan nahin diya
 But when Vasundhara Raje took over as the Chief Minister, she returned the glory of Bikaner House
 haalanki lutian jone kaa hissaa bataakar centre ne kuch hisson main nirmaan kaa kaam rukvaa diya
 Due to which the condition of the residential complex of Bikaner House has become like a slum today

 The population of expatriate Rajasthanis in Delhi is around 20 to 25 lakhs, including laborers to businessmen and industrialists
 lekin rajya kii sampattiyon par centre or dilli sarkaar ke kabje ko ve anyaay qaraar de rahe hai
 But people are surprised at not returning the rented property to the original owner
 logon kaa kahana he ki jab narsingh raav sarkaar ke samay hyderabad house ko centre ne apane kabje main liya, to badale main bagal main hi andhra bhawan ke liye badi jameen di
 But Rajasthan is not leaving the assets of the government
 agar centre apana kabja chhod de, to rajasthan kii kala-samskruti ko badhaava dene ke saath-saath rajya ke paryaton ko bhi badhaava diya ja saktaa he
 Gujarat has built Shah auditorium on its land, Kerala government has maintained educational society, Karnataka has maintained cultural confluence

 dilli metro yun to dilliwaalon kii pehali pasand he
 a great way to travel
 dilli vaale apni metro par fakr karte hai
 In the country and the world, the name of the Metro is also flaunted, but the same Delhi Metro had to apologize
 aakhir aisi koun si vajah rahi ki dilli metro apane musafiron se maafee maang rahi he
 So let us tell you what has happened
 jisane pehali baar metro ko maafee maangane ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Anuj Dayal, the executive director of the Delhi Metro, released a video apologizing for the problems faced by the passengers and the frequent flaws in the Delhi Metro
 anuj dayaal ne video main takneekee kharabiyon kii vajah se hone vaali dikkaton ko samajhaate hue kaha ki in kharabiyon kii vajah se musafiron ko kaaphi pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Actually, the Delhi Metro has been a problem for passengers since the beginning of this year
 janvari maheene main teen baar aise maukey aae hai jab metro main badi takneekee kharabiyaan aayi hai
 Due to this, the services of the metro have been affected for hours
 is vajah se metro main safar karne vaale musafiron ko mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 The breakdown in the metro continued for the second consecutive day
 On Monday, for the second consecutive day, the blue line of the metro malfunctioned and the passengers who had to go to office in the morning had to face a lot of trouble
 darasal metro kii blue line yani dwarka noida vaishali root kaa sampark aaparational control room se tut gaya
 The reason behind this was the power failure of the OCC
 isaki vajah se dwarka noida vaishali line ke bich chal rahi tamaam metro train kaa control room se sampark tut gaya
 In such a situation, the metro had to carry out commercial operations of trains
 manual oparation main metro kii raftaar saamaanya se kahin kam ho jaati he
 During this time, the metro operation between about 17 interlocking stations on this 57 km long route is operated through wireless set
 is puri prakriya main vakt lagata he or cordination bhi mushkil hota he
 This happens because several trains are in operation simultaneously between fifty stations
 haalanki dilli metro kaa daawa ki kharabi ko ek ghante ke bheetar hi thik kar liya gaya lekin musafiron ko kareeb chaar se paanch ghante tak metro main deree or ruk-ruk kar chalane vaali dikkaton se jujhna padaa

 isisi tii-20 world cap trophy uthaane kaa saubhaahgya chaahe team india ko mili yaa na mili lekin ye to lagbhag tay he ki toornament main sabase zyada ran banane kaa taj viraat kohli ke sir hi sajega, jabaki sabase zyada wicket chatakaane ke maamle main aar aswin number-1 ban sakate hai
 The final match between Team India and Sri Lanka is to be played on Sunday, after which it will be decided which team becomes the T20 champion
 viraat kohli philhal sabase aage
 
 
 Team India's brave batsman Virat Kohli continues to be the frontrunner in the race of runners in the tournament
 kohli ne abhi tak toornament main 5 match khele hai or is dauraan unhone 3 baar noteout rahete hue 121 kii jabardast ausat ke saath 242 ran banaae hai
 During this period, Virat has scored 3 pachas and his 72 runs against South Africa in the semi-finals has been his best innings
 is list main unke baad duusare number par netherlands ke tom kupar hai jinke naam par 231 ran darj hai
 At number three is Stefan Myberg of the Netherlands, who has scored 224 runs in 7 matches
 rohit sharma nikal sakate hai viraat se aage
 
 
 If anyone can follow Virat Kohli in this race, then they are Team India openers Rohit Sharma and Mahela Jayawardene
 iske alaava baaki khilaadi res se isliye baahar ho chuke hai kyonki unki timen hi toornament se out ho chuki hai
 Rohit is at number 8 after scoring 171 runs and if he has to overtake Virat in this race, he will have to score at least 71 runs
 lekin us sthiti yaa to viraat ko ballebaaji kaa mauka na mili yaa phir wo bina ran banaaen out ho jaaen
 This seems difficult given Virat's current form
 vahiin srilankai ballebaaj or apana aakhri international tii-20 match khilne ja rahe mahela jayavardhane 16wein number par hai
 There are currently 134 runs registered in the name of Jayawardene
 mahela jayavardhane ko unki barabari karne ke liye 108 ranon kii darkaar he
 But it is not so easy to score a century in T20
 philhal to viraat hi ye res jeetne ke prabal daavedaar hai
 Ashwin will be the 'best' bowler! If we talk about bowlers, then South African spin bowler Imran Tahir is on top with 12 wickets, but his team is out of the tournament
 iske alaava netherlands ke eashan malik ke naam par bhi itane hi wicket darj hai lekin unki team to lig maichon main hi baahar ho chuki he
 Caribbean bowler Samuel Badri is third in the list with 11 wickets and his team has also died in the semi-finals
 ab number aata he aar aswin kaa
 Ashwin is currently at number four with 10 wickets but to become number 1, he will have to take at least 2 wickets against Sri Lanka in the final, which is not a very difficult task
 aswin ke liye tii-20 world cap kii shuruyaat bhale hi acchhee na rahi ho lekin pichley 3 maichon main unhone na keval vaapasi kii balki 2 baar main of da match bhi bane
 Ashwin took the same wicket in the first 2 matches but took 9 wickets in the remaining 3 matches
 ab aisi form main 2 wicket lenaa unke liye mushkil nahin hona chahie
 Amit Mishra is also in this race
 
 
 team india ke ek or phiraki gendbaaj amit mishra bhi is daud main shaamil hai
 Mishra is at number six with 9 wickets and could overtake Ashwin to become the No
1 bowler of the tournament
 semifinal main pitane ke baad mishra final main vaapasi karne ke liye ji jaan laga denge
 Now it has to be seen that the fate of 'A' from Amit and Ashwin supports him and makes him the best bowler of the T20 World Cup

 Taking a dig at the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) in Uttar Pradesh, Amit Shah said that he did not care for the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, what would the state handle
 amit shah ne shuukravaar ko kanpur ke brajendra swaroop park main dhamm chetana yatra ke samaapan par jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki baba sahib doctor bhimrao ambedkar ke sammaan main jitna kaam bijepi sarkaar ne kiya, utana anya kisi ne nahin
 Then whether it is to save the birthplace of Ambedkar, to honor Bharatratna, to issue postage stamp and coin on him
 
 
 baba sahib or unke anuyaayiyon kii bhaawanaaon par sirf bijepi ne dhyaan diya he
 If the BJP forms the next government in Uttar Pradesh, then the Dalits will get their rights on the lines of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas

 This Dhamma Chetna Yatra, led by Dhamma Vireoji, was concluded in Kanpur on Friday
 yatra ke samaapan main saikadon buddha bhikshu shaamil hue
 The BJP president said that when Kashiram and Mayawati founded the BSP, Dr
 dhamm virio ne mayawati ko aashirwad diya tha, isliye unki sarkaar bani
 But the monks who blessed him are sad now, because Mayawati did not fulfill Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's dreams
 unhone kaha ki uttar pradesh main bispi kii sarkaar banane par aashaa kii gai thi ki vah daliton or pichhadon kaa kalyaan karengi, bhagwaan buddha or ambedkar ke vichaaron tathaa sapanom ko saakaar karengi, lekin aisa nahin hua
 Mayawati's wealth increased day by day, but the Dalit backward and Bhadant remained there
 mayawati ko aashirwad dekar unki sarkaar banavaane vaale bhadant ab bijepi kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 He is aware that Dalit, backward, Bhadant will be well-off for all when the BJP government is formed
 amit shah ne kaha ki bahan mayawati ambedkar ke aadarshon par chalane kii baat kahati hai, lekin unhone 10 saal tak kendra kii congress nit upie sarkaar ko samarthan diya
 He said that in the state where BJP formed the government, Baba Saheb was given full respect
 unhone kaha ki ambedkar ke janmasthal mau, landan, vadodara, nagpur dilli har jagah bijepi ne hi kaam karavaaya, congress yaa basapa ne kuch nahin kiya
 The SP government oppressed the Dalits in the state and the BSP exploited them
 yadi pradesh main bijepi kii sarkaar ai to sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mishan ke tahat dalit, pichhadaa sahit sabakaa kalyaan kiya jayega
 The Prime Minister has also launched several schemes for this
 amit shah ne pradesh kii sapa sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki farvari main uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav hone hai, lekin akhilesh yadav se kanoon vyavastha sanbhal nahin paa rahi
 'akhilesh should first improve the law and order of his clan, who is not able to take care of him, later also see the Kanu system of the state
 unase ghar ke jhagade nipatate nahin hai uttar pradesh kii samasyaon ko kaise hal karenge
 ' unhone kaha, mayawati kahati hai ki vah satta main aayin to kanoon-vyavastha sudharegi, ham kah rahe hai ki apni sampatti ghoshit karen dalit samaj jaaenge ki unka kitna kalyaan hua he
 The BJP president said that at the center of Modi's plans is always Dalits and poor
 jandhan, beemaa yojana, ujjwala yojana sab garibon ke liye hi hai
 The comments amit shah ne kaha ki rajya main parivartan dhamm yatra aaj samaapt nahin ho rahi he, yah chunaav tak jari rahegi
 Earlier, BJP state president Keshav Prasad Maurya also addressed the public meeting

 Addressing a public meeting at the conclusion of the Dhamma Chetna Yatra at Brijendra Swaroop Park in Kanpur on Friday, Amit Shah said that no one else has done as much work as the BJP government did in honor of Babasaheb Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar
 phir chaahe vah ambedkar kii janmabhumi kaa uddhaar karnaa ho, unako bharataratna sammaan dena ho, unpar dak tikat, sikaa jari karnaa ho

 Mayawati was blessed by the Dhamma heroes, so her government was formed
 lekin unhen aashirwad dene vaale bhikshu ab dukhi hai, kyonki mayawati ne baba sahab bhimrao ambedkar ke sapanom ko puraa nahin kiya
 He said that after the formation of BSP government in Uttar Pradesh, it was hoped that she would do welfare of Dalits and backward, realize the thoughts and dreams of Lord Buddha and Ambedkar, but it did not happen
 mayawati kii sampatti dinon-din badhati gai, lekin dalit pichhadaa or bhadant vahiin kaa vahiin rah gaya
 Bhadant, who blessed Mayawati and formed her government, is now supporting the BJP
 unhen gyaat he ki bijepi kii sarkaar banane par dalit, pichhadaa, bhadant sabakaa kalyaan hoga
 Amit Shah said that sister Mayawati talks about Ambedkar's ideals, but she supported the Congress-led UPA government at the Center for 10 years
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ne jis rajya main sarkaar banaayi vahaan baba sahib ko puraa sammaan diya gaya
 He said that Ambedkar's birthplace Mhow, London, Vadodara, Nagpur Delhi everywhere, BJP got the job done, Congress or BSP did nothing
 pradesh main sapa kii sarkaar ne daliton ko pratadit kiya basapa ne unka shoshan kiya
 If the BJP comes to power in the state, under the mission of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, welfare of all, including Dalits, Backward will be done
 iske liye pradhanmantri ne kai yojanaayen bhi shuru kii hai
 Taking a dig at the SP government of the state, Amit Shah said that assembly elections are going to be held in Uttar Pradesh in February, but law and order is not being managed with Akhilesh Yadav
 'akhilesh pehle apane kunbe kii kanoon vyavastha sudhaar len, jo unase sanbhal nahin paa rahi he baad main pradesh kii kananu vyavastha bhi dekh len
 How they will not solve the home fights of Uttar Pradesh
 ' He said, Mayawati says that if she comes to power, law and order will improve, we are saying that declaring her assets Dalits will understand how well they have been benefited
 bijepi adhyaksh ne kaha ki modi kii yojanaon ke kendra main hameshaa dalit or garib hi hai
