 ) Sengar does not have money to pay compensation to the victim, said Pacevakil - Economic situation is very bad, two daughters too, in the Unnao rape case, rape convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar should be punished by the lawyers of both the sides
 Was going on sibiai or peedita ke vakil kaa paksh sunne ke baad jab jaj ne senger ke vakil ko is maamle main apana paksh rakhane ko kaha, to vakil ne kaha ki kuldeep singh senger ke paas peedita ko bataur muaavja raashi dene ke liye paise hi nahin he
 The lawyer said that Sanger's financial condition is very bad
 iske alaava unki do betiyaan hai, jinaki shaadi kii jimmedaari bhi senger par hi he
 Therefore, if the victim is compensated, it should not be given by Sanger
 vakil ne tark diya ki 4 baar emale bane kuldeep senger kii aarthik haalat thik nahin he
 After hearing this argument, Judge Dharmesh Sharma said that although no compensation can compensate for the trauma inflicted on the victim, but you are saying that the financial condition of convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar is not very good, if he contests Do we fight without money? ? kya unke paas paisa nahin he?upi sarkaar de chaku he 25 lakh muaavjawakil kaa tark tha ki is maamle mensupreme court ke aadeshpar uttar pradesh sarkaar pehle hi peedita ko 25 lakh rupee de chuki he
 Therefore, if some other victim is ordered to pay the amount as compensation, the amount should not be recovered from Sanger
 haalanki, peedita ke vakil dharmendra mishra ne muaavje ko lekar senger ke vakil kii daleel par aitraaj jataayaa
 The victim's lawyer said that while giving compensation, it should be kept in mind that her father has died after the rape
 sadak durghatana main wo pita ke baad do or parivaar ke logon ko kho chuki he
 Apart from this, she has to leave Unnao to save her life and currently she is living in a rented house in Delhi
 uske paas apana ghar nahin he, isliye supreme court se mili 25 lakh ke muaavje ko philhal ke muaavje se alag hi rakhaa jaae
 On the objections of the victim's lawyer Dharmendra Mishra, Judge Dharmesh Sharma said that you said that those people cannot go back to the village, talk to the victim once again
 20 disambar ko hogi agali sunwaayeesibiai ne kaha ki peedita ko muaavja kitna diya jaae, ye kuldeep senger kii aarthik sthiti ko dhyaan main rakhkar tay kiya janaa chahie
 The CBI said that till now the Uttar Pradesh government has given compensation of Rs 25 lakh as per the order of the Supreme Court
 is maamle main peedita ko muaavja bhi diya janaa chahie
 The victim should be compensated according to the guidelines
 ab court ne senger ko chunaav ladane ke dauraan aay or sampatti se jude halafname or dastavej court main jamaa karaane ke nirdesh die hai yani kuldeep singh senger ko apni aay or sampatti kaa puraa byora dena hoga
 Sanger will have to submit all the documents related to income and property to the court before the next hearing on December 20

 a young man was attacked by a crocodile from the Vishwamitri River in the morning when a young man was sitting on the banks of the river near Medhad village on the banks of the Vishwamitri River in Vadodara, Gujarat
 magar ke hamale main yuvak buree tarah ghayal ho gaya he
 Actually, the young man was alone when the crocodile attacked
 magaramchh ne yuvak ke pair ko apane munh main fansaa liya tha
 However, the young man somehow got rid of his leg after hard work
 baad main yuvak ko vadodara ke aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya
 Significantly, there are more than 200 crocodiles in the Vishwamitri river, which are often seen on the banks of the river during the rainy season
 isi tarah banaaskantha ke daanta ke ek gaanv main buudhvaar ko ekabhaloone ek yuvak par hamalaa kar diya
 The youth is badly injured in the attack
 ghayal yuvak vahaan bhed bakriyaan charaane ke liye gaya tha
 At the same time, the bear attacked this man

 ranvir singh ko jab chopra camp ne band baaja baraat main launch kiya tha, tab kisi ne bhi nahin sochaa tha ki kabhi bade film mekars unako sin karenge
 The reason was that his street boy acting and Ranbir Kapoor also came in the industry at the same time
 kaha yahi ja rahaa tha ki res main ranbir kapur aage nikal jaaenge kyonki vah industry se jude hai or unke naam ke peeche kapur laga he
 But Ranveer Singh proved to be a more powerful player in box office figures
 yahi nahin, mana jane laga he ki vah aane vaale vakt main shahrukh or salmaan khan kii jagah bhi le sakate hai
 Ranveer gave Hema Malini's daughter a poster in the office of cheataditya
 It is said that Yash Raj Films owner Aditya Chopra has only three posters in the office - Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Ranveer Singh
 ab ise aap kisi star kii vailu hi kahenge ki salmaan khan or shahrukh khan ke baad uskaa number aae
 The reason for this is Aditya Chopra told with an interesting answer that when Ranveer makes his banner a good earning, then his poster should be installed in the office
 PHOTOS: berthde par ranvir ne kharidi nai car, deepika ko lekar gaye long drive parshahrukh ke frem main feet ranviraditya chopra ek samay par shahrukh khan ke saath hi filmein banaate the
 He made three hit films with them - Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Mohabbatein and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi
 lekin dilavaale dulhaniya le jaaenge ke modern varjan yani beficre main unhone ranvir singh ko liya
 This means that Ranveer has fit into Shahrukh's frame somewhere in his mind
 bollywood ke bajirao kii property ke bare main janenge to chaunkaa jaaenge
 
 
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali, who is famous for making Bajiraggrand films in place of Salman Khan, is also a fan of Ranveer Singh
 vah shahrukh ke saath devdas, salmaan ke saath ham dil de chuke sanam or rithik ke saath guzarish bana chuke hai
 But Ranveer Singh has dominated in his last 3 consecutive films
 jaahir he ki vah bhi har tareeke se ranvir ko kalakaar ke taur par parakh chuke hai
 Ranveer Singh is from the Sindhi family, because of this, he removed his SURNAME in place of Ranbir
 He proved himself to be heartbroken before Ranbir Kapoor was offered and his sister's character was offered to Kareena Kapoor
 aise main amir ladke kii ranvir kii shandaar parformens sabhi ko or hairaan kar gai
 By the way, in Deepika's life too, Ranveer easily replaced Ranbir
 vah deepika kaa itnaa khyaal rakhte hai ki 'mastaani' bhi shaayad ab apane pehle vale brallep se khush hongi
 There are big directors in waiting, officially not right but it is almost decided that Ranveer Singh will play the role of police in Dhoom 4
 vah film main abhishek bachchan kii jagah lenge
 At the same time, for the remake of Khalnayak Returns, she is going hard on Ranbir Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor

 6GB ram, 64GB internal memory or 10 kor vaala procesar jis smartphone main ho wo kitna fast hoga
 So fast that there is no problem of being slow for at least a year
 lekin kya sach main aisa he? kya is spacification vaale smartphone slo nahin hote yaa hang nahin karte? shaayad aapako iskaa jawaab bhi pataa hoga agar aapke paas hai and smartphone he
 We tell you 10 reasons why the speed of the smartphone is continuously reduced, especially Android device
 vajah number 1: blottware,jo aapke smartphone ke saath pre loded hote hai
 Many companies stop the option to remove it, that is, you cannot remove it even if you want to
 yesmartphone kaa kaaphi spacialete hai or agar kaishe clear na karen to kuch maheenon main ye aapke mobile ko slo karne main ahm bhumika nibhaate hai
 Reason number 2: Important apps, you can't possibly spend the day without them
 fasebuk, utyub, jimail or whatsap jaise eps kaaphi heavi hote hai jo smartphone ke ram or memory kaa jam kar yuj karte hai
 Reason number 3: background process, even after you have closed the app, it still runs in the background which consumes CPU and RAM as well
 jaahir he isse smartphone kii speed par asar padegaa
 Reason number 4: Updates, you will get updates of every big and small apps every day
 nae apadet downlod hone ke saath hi wo ap aapke divaais main zyada jagah gherte hai or aisa silsilaa tab tak chalata he jab aap menuali puraane apadats ko hataayenge nahin yaa kaishe clear nahin karenge
 The ordinary user is not able to do this and day by day his smartphone becomes slow, even if there is only 4 GB RAM
 vajah number 5: ap foulder,zyaadaatar ap mobile main install hone ke saath hi ek foulder taiyaar karte hai jisamen un eps ke data store hote hai jinhen aap dekh nahin paata
 It is interesting that even if you delete that app, that folder still stays in your smartphone until you manually deal with it
 kai baar aap samaj bhi nahin pate ki kyon aapke smartphone kii memory phul ho rahi he uskaa kaaran yah bhi he
 Reason number 6: Time, time passes and Android smartphones start slowing down
 aisa isliye kyonki nae ap heavi hote jate hai, zyada data lete hai, graphics zyada hote hai or har apadet ke saath zyada memory or processing power lene lagate hai
 The result is that the use of RAM starts to be hundred percent and it starts to hang
 vajah number 7: oparating system,kisi bhi smartphone kaa oparating system us smartphone kii aatma hoti he
 Companies provide new updates through which new features and security patches are added
 ye apadet aapke smartphone main bas jate hai or iskaa asar aapke divaais par dikhataa he
 Reason number 8: Warming up, as your brain gets warm, it affects your productivity, in the same way as the smartphone becomes slow after overheating
 kai baar yah over charging se hota he to kai baar jarurat se jyada program ek saath chalaane par
 This increases its processing frequency and makes the phone warm
 jaise hi phone garm hota he isamen diya gaya procesar frequency ko kam kar detaa he taaki thandha ho sake
 For example, if you have used wifi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFAC simultaneously, then see the scene
 vajah number 9: kharaab quality,bhale hi apakesmartphone kaa hardware tagada ho lekiniski quality kharaab hogi to yah aapke liye problem creat karegaa
 It is also important for you to ensure that what is the quality of the hardware provided inside the smartphone
 vajah number 10: aapkaa aalas,last time apane smartphone kii andruni safai kab kii he aapako shaayad yaad na ho
 Browsing browsing history, caches, junk files, redundant folders and backups keep the mobile processing slow
 isliye sirf mobile companiyon ko iske liye kosna bhi sahi nahin
 BJP President Rajnath Singh interacted with Rahul Kanwal, Managing Editor of Headlines Today, in Aaj Tak Channel's Sidhi Baat program

 You have only cut Nitinji's leaf
 patta kisi ne nahin kaata, sabhi chaahate the ki ve adhyaksh ke rup main doosraa kaarykaal puraa karen lekin un par bebuniyaad aarope lage to unhone swayan tyaagptr de diya
 But why did we not resign earlier? First we used to explain so they stopped
 nitin ji nagpur laute to kaha ki bijepi kii sarkaar banegi to inakam tex vibhaag waalon ko dekh luungaa
 He said that the administration system should be completely neutral, irrespective of the government of any political party
 aresas ke adhikari jid kar rahe the ki gadakari ko hi adhyaksh banaaya jaae
 The RSS had no such stubbornness
 pehle vaajapeyi-adwani kii jodi or ab rajnath-modi kii jodi
 There is no doubt that Narendra Modi is the popular leader of the country, but who will be assigned the responsibility, it will be decided in the core group meeting
 kaha ja rahaa he ki narendra modi ko aage rakhane se 2014 ke chunaavon main bijepi ko phayda hoga
 i am the president of the party and cannot say alone what will happen? The party will decide by consensus who to project, not whom
 kya yah hakeekat nahin ki aresas kii ore se adhyaksh pad ke liye rajnath kaa naam aane par adwani ne naa kah diya tha?mujhe aam sahmati se chunaa gaya he
 If there was factionalism, i would not have elected
 grih mantri (susheel kumaar) scindia ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi-aresas aatankwaadi paidaa kar rahe hai or hamalon main unka haath he
 i want to inform Shinde Saheb that Rajnath Singh has also received training in RSS and BJP camps
 bijepi ke kai netaa sangh ke shiviron main gaye he
 If we train terrorists, first of all we should arrest them
 grih mantralay ne 12 naam die jinka naam sangh se judaa he or un par karrwai chal rahi he
 Shinde's statement is irresponsible
 congress main bahut saare log hai jo sangh kii shakhaon main gaye hai
 This does not mean that the entire organization is maligned
 par aresas ke haath hone kaa saboot he
 So i say that Sushma Swaraj, me and Arun Jaitley should be arrested as well
 kyonki ye sabhi aresas ke swayamsevak hai

 There is such a ruckus on saffron terrorism between the Congress and the BJP that the budget session may be in trouble
 grih mantralay kaa aarope he ki bijepi or sangh aatankwaadi shivi chalaate hai
 Where is the evidence? Whenever elections come, BJP does politics of religion
 kuch blasts ke liye jimmedaar jo bhi log pakade gaye, un sabhi ke sambandh aresas yaa bijepi se hai
 The politics of religion was first started by your colleague

 It is alleged that the Sangh and BJP run terrorist camps

 After all, why did BJP leaders go to meet the people responsible for the blast? You went ahead of Shindeji
 aresas ek sanghathan he jiske logon ne aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main hissaa liya
 Suppose, many Congress leaders are also involved in murder and rape, but no one has said that Congress is a party of Criminals
 hamane nahin bolaa ki bijepi criminal party he
 Some people have been caught, who are related to BJP and RSS
 par dharm ko laane kii baat kahaan se aa gai?bajet satr shuru hone vaala he
 BJP has made it clear that Shinde should be boycotted
 aise main satr kaise chalegaa?jab bhi satr shuru hone vaala hota he, bijepi koi-na-koi aisa mudda le aati he ki satr chal na sake
 Why does BJP want to talk on TV instead of discussing in Parliament? Congress is worried that Modi is coming to Delhi
 aise main rahul gandhi kaa kya hoga?hamane kabhi dharm ke aadhaar par raajnneeti nahin kii
 It is playing BJP
 jab ellection aate hai to bijepi baantne kii baat karti he
 The Congress will fight with a thought and strong leadership
 yah bataaie ki sarkaar lokapal ko lagaataar kamjor kyon kar rahi he?yah galat baat he
 We have done as much as we can to strengthen the Lokpal

 So is the CAG acting like a political party? No, but things are leaking even before the report comes
 is par bhi niyantran banane kii jarurat he
 Justice Verma reported how the rape laws should be reformed
 lekin jo sabase ahm suzav the, ve aapane maane nahin

 Till today, in the midst of electoral stir in the country, people tried to find the pulse of the people
 desh bhar ke 27 shaharon main aaj tak ne bol india bol naam kii ek muhim chalaai
 Seven questions were asked to people in this campaign
 in sawaalon main samprag sarkaar ke pichley paanch saalon kaa kaarykaal kaisaa rahaa? aaj desh main koun si samasya sabase badi he or koun si party aapaki ummiido par khari utar sakati he? pradhanmantri kise bananaa chahie? aadi shaamil the
 The public has given its impeccable opinion on all matters
 " "logon se pehla sawaal yah poocha gaya tha ki upie sarkaar kaa pichley paanch saalon main kaam kaisaa rahaa? zyaadaatar logon ne upie sarkaar ke pichley paanch saal ke kaarykaal ko ausat qaraar diya
 19 percent of the people described the tenure of the UPA government as very good while 25 percent of the people considered it good
 32 pratishat logon kii najar main upie kaa kaarykaal ausat rahaa
 In this way, it can be said that 76 percent people are in favor of the UPA government
 12 pratishat logon ne upie ke kaarykaal ko kharaab or 10 pratishat logon ne ise bahut kharaab qaraar diya
 "" The second question was what is the biggest problem facing the country? Terrorism is the biggest problem facing the country in the eyes of most of the people of the country
 39 phisadi log maanate hai aatankwaad sabase badi samasya he jabaki 20 pratishat logon kii najar main bhrashtachar badi samasya he
 19 percent of people consider inflation to be the biggest problem, while 18 percent people have also described the economic slowdown as a major problem
 bijli bhi 3 pratishat logon ke liye bahut badi samasya he
 "" The third question people were asked was, which issue would you vote for? People have given the most importance to the issue of development
 69 pratishat logon ne vot dene ke liye vikaas ke mudde ko hi sabase ahm mana he
 The issue of Hinduism and casteism in front of development seems insignificant
 15 pratishat logon ne ummidavaar kii chhavi ko vot dene ke liye mahatvapurn mudda mana he
 "" The fourth question people were asked was, who could better deal with terrorism? In response to this question too, UPA proved to be trustworthy for the people
 45 pratishat logon ne congress ke netritv main upie ko aatankwaad se nipatane main adhik sakasham mana he jabaki endie ko 42 pratishat logon kaa samarthan mila he
 The Third Front could become the choice of only 8 percent of the people
 " "paanchvaan sawaal tha ki aarthik mandi ko rokane main kiski sarkaar sabase kargar hogi?isamen bhi baaji congress or upie ke haath lagi
 48 per cent believe that UPA can effectively deal with recession while 42 per cent support NDA on this issue
 " "logon se chatha sawaal yah poocha gaya ki agali sarkaar kiski honi chahie? adhikansh logon kii najar main vartmaan upie sarkaar hi acchhee he
 48 percent want the UPA to form the government again at the Center, while 42 percent want the NDA to be led by the BJP
 teesraa morcha yahaan bhi aadharahin prathit hota he
 "" The seventh and most important question was asked to the people, who should become the Prime Minister of the country? LK Advani won the case in this case
 adwani ko 34 pratishat logon ne pradhanmantri ke rup main apni pehali pasand mana he jabaki manmohan singh ko 32 pratishat logon kaa samarthan mila he
 23 per cent of people want to see Rahul Gandhi as the next Prime Minister
 uttar pradesh main sarkaar bane ek maheenaa ho gaya he
 The rulers of Lucknow are in the rain of the transfers and they need a short time to improve or spoil the Nizam
 lekin soobe ke sabase khubasurat shaharon main shumaar rampur kii kahani alag he
 Azam Khan rules here
 yahaan sahi-galat kaa faisla karne ke liye cameti or kamishan kii gunjaaish nahin he
 The interview of Azam Khan is the eye of the 64-year-old Azam Bhai (rampur people call him the same), the biggest concern to be right for the police and the administration
 akhilesh sarkaar ke kaddavar mantri kaa agenda fiks he
 The promises made in the election will be fulfilled by Dunke's injury
 isse fark nahin padataa ki log ise badale kii karrwai kehete hai yaa phir vikaas kii bayaar
 Within a fortnight of taking the oath of office, Azam Khan has brought a bit of a stir in the city
 shahar ko 24 ghante bijli milane lagi
 In Azam's court, there was an increase in the number of complainants and complaints in his office began to be dealt with quickly
 daggamar basen band hai
 Forcible fees for private hospitals were fixed
 muslimbahul shahar main gosht ke daam fiks or niryaat par pabandi
 Jigsaw machines and plywood factories operating unlicensed shut down
 kanshiram awaason par danaadan chaape pade or apaatr logon par kanoon kaa danda chalaa
 Bulldozers are gaining traction over illegal constructions
 aakhir itani jaldbaaji kyon? kahin shashan ke is danda ke peeche rajnatik badale kii karrwai to nahin
 After all, how can a minister in a democratic country ask the doctors to fix fees and the Quraysh for meat? Is this the reason for the open market economy? If you call it dictatorship, what is the harm? Azam's Robinhood-style answer is, "it is not dictatorship, it is socialism
" agar jaalimon ke julm kaa virodh karnaa julm he, to main jaalim hum
 i have won the election on these issues
 '' lekin logon ko sanbhalane ke liye ek mauka to diya hota? 60,000 se zyada voton se jite netaa kaa sidhaa jawaab, ''agar abhi inaki gardan nahin pakadta to phir inhen kaabo karnaa mushkil ho jaataa
 "but his opponents do not agree with this
" unke khilaaf congress ke tikat par chunaav lade doctor tanwir ahamed khan kehete hai, ''ajam khan rajnatik badale kii karrwai kar rahe hai
 The same doctors' hospitals have been closed, which helped me in the election
 mujhe khud prectis karne se roka ja rahaa he
 Construction of our new hospital has been stopped
 '' darasal, unka yah aspataal samaajawaadee party karyaalay ke thik bagal kii jameen par he
 The doctor alleges that Azam Khan wanted to occupy this land, and failing this, he stopped construction with the help of the administration
 kansaltency fees kam karaane ke liye kya ajam khan ne sidhaa farmaan aapke paas bheja yaa unke aadmi aae? agar nahin aae to fees kam karne ke liye kaise baadhya kiya?iskaa jawaab kuch is tarah he, ''sidhaa farmaan nahin aayaa, lekin fees kam na karne vaale doctoron ke aspataal uttar pradesh medical council ke niyamon ke aadhaar par band kara die gaye
 If the rules of the council have been pressurized, then even a private hospital cannot run in the entire state
 lekin karrwai sirf ham par or hamaare samarthakon par ho rahi he
 "instead of replying to the doctor's allegations, Azam stands him in the dock," says a doctor of twelve hundred and fifty patients

 Azam was second accused by Rampur Transport Union President Tahir Ali
 ali kii ek darjan basen is samay shahar ke alag-alag thanon main jabt hui padi hai
 These buses were seized without knowing that they do not have permits
 haalanki ali kaa daawa he, ''hamaare paas saare kaagaj hai
 Even if there is no paper, buses can be left with a fine
 lekin jab tak ajam khan nahin kahenge basen nahin chhutengi
 Ali, once close to Azam Khan, is a Congress leader nowadays and he is considered a strong contender to contest the election for municipal president
 shahar main charchaa he ki chunavi daavedaari ke pehle unki mali haalat khasta karne ke liye yah karrwai kii gai he
 The same allegations are being leveled by the operators of more than 100 piling (plywood) machines in the city, but they do not want to get their names published and the reason for this is because of Azam's fear
 meet ke kaarobaari to khayr ajam bhai ke bataae daam par hi meet bechney lage hai
 His friend R, who studied up to class IX with Azam Khan on his character
 ke
 Jain says, "azam is stubborn from the beginning
 uskaa vaaki khauf he
 On March 6, all the miscreants fled the city before the counting of votes was over
 '' ajam khud bhi maanate hai ki unhen samajhna aasaan nahin he
 To see Azam's Azmat, we left the political lanes and tried to face the common man
 or isaki sabase badi baangi aajkal ajam khan ke janata darbar main najar aati he
 Political opponents, businessmen and doctors get a second look here as a leader who is forced to kneel in front of 'azmi Socialism'
 rampur ke purv nawab ke darbar haul (ab vishwa prasiddh raja librari) se kosi ke tatbandh tak jane vaale topakhana road par samaajawaadee party ke karyaalay main janata darbar lagata he
 The distance of this Janata Durbar from the Nawab's old court will be barely 100 steps
 lohe ke bade daravaaje se bheetar daakhil hone par bheetar hari ghaas kaa bada lon he
 Two big halls are inside the Janata Durbar
 ek haul janaana or doosraa mardaana he
 Even before the arrival of the minister, Karinde tells us to sit in the complainant hall
 janaana haul main kareeb 50 kursiyon par paradaanashin auraten apni-apni fariyaad lekar baithi hai
 Azam comes here first
 haul main unke liye bhi kursi he lekin vah khaali rahati he
 The specialty of the Janata Durbar is that the complainant does not come to Azam Bhai and Azam himself goes to everyone
 baatcheet ke dauraan bhi ve khud khadey rahete hai or khatunon ko baithe-baithe apni baat rakhni hoti he
 After hearing the complaints one by one, he met his mother when he came with the five-year-old girl Naina
 to uski maa ne kaha, ''naina ko thelicemia he
 It needs blood
 ''ajam khan ne turant peeche khadey shaks ko ishaara kiya or vah ek gaadi main bacchee ko blad bank lekar chalaa gaya
 By the time an old woman reported her illness, arrangements were made for her to be sent to the hospital by car
 lekin jab kisi mohatarama ne naukari dilaane kii maang rakhi to ajam ne saaf kah diya, ''maine aisa vaada kabhi nahin kiya
 The woman, who came to the wrongly recommended to cancel the eviction of the family occupied in Kanshi Ram residence, also received a sharp response from Azam
 or jab vah mahila mantri ke munh par hi naaraazgi jataakar chali gai to bhi ajam apane patale chashme main se jhaankati ankhon se muskuraate hi najar aae
 The same arrangement was done in the masculine hall
 zyaadaatar fariyaaden garibon ko makaan dilaane or police keson se judi thim
 Some people also wanted jobs here
 jo kaam ajam ko apni jad main lagate hai, unke bare main unka sidhaa jawaab he, ''inshwalla (allaah ne chaha to) ho jayega
 You be relaxed
 ''jab ek aadmi apane jhapatmar bhai ko chhudaane kii sifarish lekar aayaa to pehle to ajam use sabar se sunate rahe, lekin jab usne bhai ko chhudaane ke liye yah daleel de daali ki police ne uski dadhi mundava di he to ajam bhadak gaye
 "you have crossed the limit
 aap shahar main fasaad karaayenge
 You can go to the extent of getting rid of your thief brother
 kiski himmat he jo rampur main kisi kii dadhi mundava de
 We have not seen it till date
 10 saal kii gavaahi mere saamne he ki aapkaa bhai dadhi nahin rakhata
 This case has to be looked into carefully
 ''ajam khan ko apane shahar ke logon ke naam, kaam, karatuuton or mansoobon kaa kaaphi kuch andaja he
 Those people were also present in his Janata Durbar who are accused of betting and gambling in the city
 aise hi ek aadmi ne jab aage se sudharne ke vaada kiya to ajam ne chutki lee, ''dekhie pehle nahin sudhare
 Now when they are being caught, they are asking to improve
 sudhar jaaie acha he, lekin pichley kiye kaa to bhugat lijie
 "when a man's tears came while saying his words, Azam called this reporter and said," This is Suresh Kumar
 muradabad ke parasoopura vaaje gaanv ke
 Their 12-year-old daughter was gangraped on June 12, 2011
 jab ladki ne kaha ki vah aropiyon ko pahchaan legi to uski ankhen phod deen
 She said that if she recognized the voice, she strangled her to death
 pichley paanch saal main bahut julm dekha he in logon ne
 "suresh brought a complaint that no arrests have been made so far, Azam assured," it will be now
 '' mardaana main shikaayatein nibat nahin pai tab tak janaana haul ek baar phir bhar gaya
 And the same round of complaints started again
 or jab ajam lakhanu main hote hai to shikaayatein dekhne ke liye vahaan teen petiyaan rakh chodi hai
 Janata Darbar runs till noon and Azam then went to his dream project Mohammad Ali Johar University
 ve is nijee vishvavidhyalay ke aaajeevan vaais chancelar hai
 Azam has been accused of acquiring land for this university spread over 250 acres
 kai logon ne shikaayat kii he ki unki jameen ko ajam ne jabaran kabjaya he
 Rampur Nawab Kazim Ali Khan alias Naved Mian alleges that large-scale government land has been acquired for the university
 is par ajam kii safai he, ''ek inch jameen bhi aisi nahin he, jiskaa paisa maine check se na chukaaya ho
 If the land was occupied then why did the government not take any action against me in the last five years
 ''raat nau baje ke aasapaas jab log khaanaa-khaakar tivi par serial dekhne kii taiyaari karte hai, tab janata darbar kaa doosraa adhyay khulata he
 In this chapter, officers of the district keep their files ready in the government guest house of Rampur
 ajam ke paas bhale hi nagar vikaas vibhaag ho, lekin peedblyoody, sinchai, shiksha, police or prashasan tak sabhi amalon ke afasar yahaan talab kiye jate hai
 Every officer has to take dictation from Azam Khan, even if he has nothing directly to do with Azam Khan's department
 yah unki aisi samaantar kachhari he jahaan tamaam muddon par panchayat faisle hote hai
 Actually, this late night court is the real Nizam of Rampur
 or guest house se ek sadak chhodkar bani nawabi daur kii aaleeshaan colector kothi kahin-na-kahin yaheen se nikalne vaale hukum ke tahat chalati he
 That is why when Rampur Collector Anil Dhingra was asked about the strict actions going on in the city, his rude reply was, "is something going wrong?" The original palace of the Nawabs in Rampur 'khas Bagh' is now desolate Already happened
 maujuuda nawabon kaa 'nur mahal' aabaad to he lekin benur najar aata he
 The new Nawab of the city is the son of the late Mumtaz Khan, who visited Amiri on the day of Gurbat, who ran a typing institute in Rampur
 ajam apane turre se kaam karte hai or is turre main bahut baar kanoon kii dahalij paar ho jaati he, lekin rampur waalon ko shaayad uski yah adaa bha gai he, tabhi to aath baar se ajam bhai unke vidhayak hai
 But this pampering of the public is being paid to the political interests of Azam, which to be justified will be a big risk for democracy
 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko bihar, madhya pradesh or assam main medical post grajuation main admician ke liye counselling kii date badhaakar 23 june tak kar di
 The court said that the last date for the admission process and fee submission would be June 25

 While Gujarat and Maharashtra informed the court that the admissions process in those states had been completed

 The court expressed its disapproval of the methods of admission to medical before changing the predetermined time table of second phase counseling
 court ne kaha, ‘hai court sahit sabhi nyaayalay is kaam main lage hai
 He said that the courts have spent precious time in settling the admissions issue
 court ne vidhyaarthiyon ko die jane vaale bahut se vikalpon or avasaron se paidaa hone vaali samasyaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue faisla sunaaya, ‘counselling kaa khulaa charan yojit kiya jayega or vidhyaarthiyon ko pravesh kaa ek mauka diya jayega
 'additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh told the court that after the completion of the second phase of counseling in the country, the rest of the quota seats are assigned to the state government and the responsibility of filling these seats is with the state government
 court ne kaha ki bihar, madhya pradesh or assam duusare charan kii counselling puri hone ke baad yah suchit karenge ki akhil bhartiya cote se koun si siten dobaaraa aabantan ke liye uplabdh hai
 In a meeting in Indore, Kailash Vijayvargiya once said in the presence of Shivraj Singh that the CM has made me a nobleman of Sholay, has cut both hands, does not allow me to do any work
 iske baad sthaneey akhbaaron main unhen kai baar thakur likhaa gaya lekin thakur ab kahani ko sholay ke climex par le jane ko betaab nazar aa rahaa he- yani vah seen jab thakur, gabbar ke haath kaat detaa he

 Kailash does not make a difference among his devotees - Dons like Yuvraj Ustad, Munna Doctor, Hemant Yadav and Manoj Parmar have both big hands and wallets

 Kailash Bhiya makes the elderly pass the Vaitarani, takes care of those who have gone to heaven, when the mayor was there, people who reached God were also given pension, has anyone been able to take such care of the people? wo sadhujanon kaa saath kabhi nahin chhodte, yaad kariye jab sab asaram ko akelaa chhod rahe the to unhone kaha tha ki asaram baapu ko fansaaya ja rahaa he, peedit ladki raajnneeti se prerit aarope laga rahi he
 He also went to meet Sadhvi Pragya, accused of the Malegaon blast
 kailash bhiyaa behad sidhe or saral hai or ye mediavaale unke bayaan ko tod marod or kai baar to nichodkar pesh kar dete hai
 Bhiya has said that are you a big journalist than us? Comments yaad he ek baar angreji bolne vaale arnab goswami ko bhi dho daalaa, tab samarthakon ne uskaa video khub farward kiya tha
 He may not have flown Jyotiraditya Scindia's gill in the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association election but he was not an add on to the hoop

 bade dharmik hai kailash bhiyaa, bhajan gaate hai dandiya bhi kar lete hai or ghar kii izzat der shaam ghar se nikle vah bhi bhiyaa ko pasand nahin
 But they are engaged in saving the tradition and culture of the country, only then they roared after the Nirbhaya scandal, girls should not cross the Lakshman Rekha

 The incident of ball tempering in the third Test played at Cape Town between South Africa and Australia has shaken the whole world cricket
 australian captain steve smith par isisi kii taraf se 1 match kaa bain lagaaya gaya he, vahiin unpar 100 pratishat match fees kaa bhi jurmaana laga he
 Apart from this, Cricket Australia has also removed Smith from the captaincy
 haalanki, bhartiya cricketer harbhajan singh samet kai cricket diggajon kii maane to ye sazaa kaaphi kam he
 Harbhajan has also questioned the intention of the ICC regarding this
 duusari taraf agar cricket australia ke niyamon ko hi dekh len to uske mutabik steve smith or camran bencroft par kaaphi kadi karrwai ho sakati he
 Bhajji besieges the ICC! Harbhajan Singh, popularly known as Turbanator, is not happy with the amount of punishment given to these players
 unhone is sajaa par isisi par tanj ksaa he
 Harbhajan has said, 'wow ICC
 adbhut faisla or gajab kii nishpakshta dikhaai
 Despite all the evidence being against Bancroft, no ban was imposed on him
 2001 main to hamaare chah khilaadiyon ke khilaaf koi saboot na hone ke baavjood zyada apil karne par bain lagaaya tha
 And remember the 2008 Sydney Test? Fault not found, yet banned for three matches
 aapke paas alag-alag logon ke liye alag-alag niyam hai
 'wow @ iccwow
 Great treatment nd fairplay
 No ban for Bancroft with all the evidences whereas 6 of us were banned for excessive appealing in South Africa 2001 without any evidence and Remember Sydney 2008? Not found guilty and banned for 3 matches
 different people different rules— Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh)march 25, 2018kya kahati he rule book?cricket australia ne is maamle main jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 According to board rules, if any player is found playing the game against his / her ideals
 to niyam 42 ke mutabik us par life bain tak lag saktaa he
 However, this is the maximum punishment awarded under this rule
 life bain, kii gai harakat or paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue lagaaya jaataa he
 Ball tampering case 2 in Australian cricket rules

 1 ke tahat smith par aarope lagaae gaye hai
 Apart from this, 100% match fees have been deducted
 vahiin camran bencraft par match fees kaa 75 fisadi jurmaana laga he
 Why are questions arising? Actually, the punishment given by the ICC is also raising questions because the players have admitted their mistake
 match ke baad bencraft ne gend ke saath chhedhkhani karne kii baat ko kabuula
 Apart from this, Steve Smith also said that this was part of our plan and i and the senior players of the team had full news about it
 isi baat ko lekar sawaal kiya ja rahaa ha ki jab galati karne vaale khilaadi apni baat ko maan rahe hai to phir us hisaab se sajaa kyon nahin di ja rahi he

 Given the seriousness of the case, the Australian government also stepped into action
 ghatana ke kuch hi ghante baad australian sarkaar ne sie se steve smith ko captaini se hataane ke liye kaha tha
 According to Cricinfo's report, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also called the incident "shocking and disappointing"
 turnbul ne kaha, 'ham sabhi subah-subah dakshin africa kii khabaron se niraash hue
 It seemed completely beyond belief that the Australian cricket team was involved in the fraud
 'kya hua tha tisare test main?bataa den ki cricket austrailia kii website ke mutabik bencroft ko match ke dauraan apni pant se koi pile rang kii vastu nikaalte hue dekha gaya tha
 After this, the umpires asked him what he had in his pocket
 video main dikhaaya gaya he ki bencroft gend par kuch laga rahe hai or use phir waapas apni jeb main rakh rahe hai, bencroft ne mana he ki wo pile rang kaa tepe tha
 Australian captain Steven Smith also apologized for this
 unhone kaha he "hamane iske bare main baat kii or sochaa tha ki isse hamen phayda hoga, netritv iske bare main jaanata tha
 i am not proud of it at all
 " unhone kaha, "prashikshak isamen shaamil nahin hai, meri captaini main yah dobaaraa nahin hoga
 " mujffarnagar dange ke baad dilli memrashtriya ekta parishad (enisi) kii baithak hui
 In this meeting, no Chief Minister of the bjp-ruled state, except the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan, came
 yahaan piem manmohan singh ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki dange kii ghatnaayen ek aisi sampradayik daraar ko jaahir karti hai jo hamaare desh ke kaumi ekta ke khilaaf he or isaki ham sab ko gahari chintaa honi chahie
 He stressed that action should be taken against the culprits soon
 enisi kii yah baithak uttar pradesh ke muzaffarnagar or uske padosi jilon main hue sampradayik dangon ke turant baad ho rahi he at: isaki ahmiyat or bhi bad jaati he
 On this occasion, Manmohan Singh said that it seems that the anti-national forces are getting successful from time to time to deepen and exploit the differences between the sects
 piem ne is baat par jor diya ki sampradayik dushmani se desh main kisi ko phayda nahin hone vaala he
 He appealed to all parties to help maintain communal unity in the country
 saath hi kaha ki prashasan ko chahie ki vah na sirf teji se choti ghatnaon ko bada rup lene se roke, balki sampradayik hinsa ke liye jimmedaar logon ko jald se jald sajaa bhi dilwaaye
 But at the same time, the PM also instructed that the action of the government should be seen to be done according to the law so that the citizens of all religions can be assured of equality
 is maukey par pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne desh main mahilaon kii suraksha par chintaa jataate hue kaha ki mahilaon ke prati aparaadh ko rokane ke liye maansikta badalane kii jarurat he
 He said, 'it is a shame that women are not being treated fairly
 ummid he ki is sammelan main mahilaon ke prati hinsa kii rokthaam ke liye achche suzav aaenge
 "he said," The development of the country will happen only when women can come out of freedom, take decisions by independence
 hamen mahilaon ke prati aparaadh rokane ke liye maansikta badalane kii jarurat he
 In his speech, the PM has also expressed concern about the atrocities against Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections
 soshal media par piem ne kaha ki yah ek nayaa madhyam he
 It should be used in a positive way so that communal unity remains

 In the Lok Sabha elections, Modi may have stormed other parts of the country, but in Punjab, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh elevated his political stature
 punjab kii 13 loksabhaa siton main se congress ne 8 siton par kabja jamaaya
 Amarinder Singh played the captain's innings despite enduring all the troubles including the Modi factor
 shiromani akali dal se judaa badal parivaar ho yaa bijepi yaa phir aam aadmi party, kisi ko bhi punjab main 'maharaja' kii 'siyaasi sultanate' main khaas send lagane kaa mauka nahin mila
 The results of Punjab in the Lok Sabha elections proved that Captain is the undisputed leader
 congress main hi unke virodhiyon main congress netaa or punjab ke cabinet mantri navjot singh siddhu, unki patni navjot cor siddhu ke alaava pratap singh bajva ko bhi mana jaataa he
 But the results of Punjab have pushed all these opponents to the backfoot
 'frandli match' vaali tippanee or punjab ke nateezon se baikfoot par aae navjot singh siddhu ne punjab kii 13 loksabhaa siton main se bathinda or gurdaspur main prachaar kiya tha
 Congress lost both these seats
 captain or unke kuch cabinet sahyogi siddhu ke khilaaf apni hi party ke khilaaf bayaan dene ke liye karrwai kii maang kar chuke hai
 Let me tell you that Sidhu had talked about playing a 'friendly match' by the Congress and the Akali Dal at an election rally
 ye vivaadit bayaan siddhu ne bathinda kii raily main diya tha
 Here the Congress candidate had to be defeated in front of the Akali Dal's Harsimrat Kaur
 captain ne kaha ki siddhu ke bayaan se congress kii chhavi ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 The Captain said on Thursday that he would soon raise the issue of Sidhu's statement that he had damaged the party during the election campaign before the Congress high command, due to which the party could not win the Bathinda seat
 punjab main congress ke pradarshan par siddhu ke bayaan se asar ke bare main puche jane par captain ne koi sidhaa jawaab nahin diya
 The Captain instead said that Sidhu's performance should be reviewed
 captain ne ingit kiya ki congress kaa pradarshan shahari kshetron main acha nahin rahaa jabaki siddhu shahari vikaas mantri hai
 According to the Captain, everyone has the right to promote himself but once the election battle started, it was not right to give a controversial statement from Sidhu
 mukhyamantri ne doharaaya ki siddhu kii pakistan sena ke pramukh ke saath ‘yaari or jhappi’ ko hamaare sainik bardaasht nahin kar sakate
 The blood of our soldiers should be shed by Pakistani intelligence agency ISI and they should embrace their leaders, this cannot be tolerated
 gurdaspur main punjab congress adhyaksh kii haar ke peeche gutbajeepunjab main congress 8 siton par nirnaayak badhat banane main safal rahi, lekin gurdaspur main party ke pradesh adhyaksh sunil jakhad ko abhinayta or bijepi ummidavaar sani deol ke saamne haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 It is being said that he did not get the support of former Punjab Congress President Pratap Singh Bajwa, who is considered to be the anti-captain camp
 bajva us vakt behad naaraaz hue the, jab captain ne sunil jakhad ko punjab kaa bhavi mukhyamantri kehete hue parichay karaayaa tha
 Although the Captain had said this to woo the Hindu voters of Gurdaspur, but Bajwa had passed away
 bajva ne khud ko gurdaspur main party ke prachaar se dur rakhaa
 In non-bailable offenses, the way of anticipatory bail has now been cleared
 agrim jamaanat se jude sanshodhan ko raashtrapati kii manjuuri milane ke baad pradesh kii yogi sarkaar ne isaki adhisuchana jari kar di he
 However, many conditions have also been imposed regarding this
 bataa den ki isse pehle aise kai dharaaen hoti thi jinpar agrim jamaanat nahin milti thi
 According to this new rule, it will no longer be necessary for the accused to be present during the hearing of anticipatory bail
 iske alaava jis dauraan poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa jayega, tab abhiyukt ko police adhikari yaa vivechak ke samaksh upasthit hona padegaa
 Not only this, the applicants will not be able to threaten the witnesses and other persons related to the case in any way nor give any kind of assurance
 lekin in sabhi maamalon se itar ye agrim jamaanat kii suvidha SC / ST act main nahin milegi
 That is, the facility of anticipatory bail which is going to be given will not be applicable in serious crime cases including SC / ST Act
 saath hi aatanki gatividhiyon se jude maamalon (analophul activity act 1967), aafitial act, narkotics act, gangster act va maut kii sajaa se jude mukademon main agrim jamaanat nahin mil sakegi
 According to the new proposal, all applications for advance bail under the bill will have to be disposed of within 30 days from the date of their arrival
 court ko antim sunwaayee se saat din pehle lok abhiyojak ko notice bhejnaa bhi anivaary hoga
 In cases relating to anticipatory bail, the court may decide on the basis of the nature and severity of the indictment, the history of the applicant, his tendency to flee from justice and the charge made for the purpose of humiliating the applicant

 yahaan dekhen film kaa nayaa gaanaa celfish The Delhi Women's Commission has rescued a minor girl from Bihar from the house of a software engineer at Dwarka Mor in Delhi
 ladki se gharelu naukaraani ke rup main kaam karavaaya jaataa tha
 In fact, on the 181 Women's helpline of the Delhi Women's Commission, a woman lodged a complaint that every day there is a screaming voice of a girl from her neighborhood, one day she somehow managed to talk to the girl
 bacchee ne use bataaya ki usase us ghar main jabardasti gharelu kaam karavaaya jaataa he or roj use peeta jaataa he
 On receiving the complaint, the Delhi Commission for Women immediately formed a team and sent it to the address given at Dwarka Mor
 vahaan pahunch kar ayog kii team ne bacchee se baat kii
 She is only 10–11 years old, and she had been working here for the past 5–6 months
 bacchee ne bataaya ki uski maalikn roj use peethti thi or ghar kaa sara kaam usase karwaati thi
 He also told her that she was neither allowed to talk to her parents nor she was given food properly
 apni baat bataate hue bacchee rone lagi or use vahaan se le jane kii baat kahi
 When the Women's Commission team tried to take the child, its owner started creating a ruckus
 ayog kii team ne phir dilli police ko soochna di or police maukey par pahunchi
 With the help of police, the girl was rescued from there
 bacchee ko vahaan se uttam nagar police thane laayaa gaya jahaan bacchee ke bayaan ke aadhaar par jeje act ke antargat maalik ke khilaaf mukadmaa darj kiya gaya
 The girl was taken to the hospital for medical examination
 bacchee ko bal kalyaan samiti ke samaksh pesh kiya gaya jahaan se usko shelter home bhej diya gaya he
 Delhi Women's Commission chairperson Swati Maliwal said, 'I feel very concerned about the increasing cases of harassment of minor girls
 mujhe yah samaj nahin aata ki kaise itane padhe likhe or achche pariwaron ke log garib bacchon ke saath itnaa bura vyavhaar karte hai
 Is there no humanity in them at all? i appeal to all people that if they see anything wrong happening around them then inform us immediately so that we can take action
 ' On July 5, on the 22nd foundation day of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), when Tej Pratap stood up to address the party workers, younger brother Tejashwi gently asked him to 'tackle quickly'
 bade yadav pareshaan ho gaye or unhone bhari sabha main yah baat bayaan kar di
 Tej Pratap said, "tejashwi must be thinking that i should give him a chance to speak
" main duungaa
 They are going to Delhi by evening flight
 phir main yahaan har cheez sambhaal luungaa
 "he compared himself to 'lord Krishna' standing in front of 'arjun trapped in the oops' and claimed to be the senior in the family, using the speculation of his father Lalu Prasad Yadav
" is dauraan tejasvi asahaj dikhaai de rahe the
 This was not the first time the elder brother had openly spoken about his mind
 june main unhone twit karke apni naapnsadagi jaahir kii thi ki kis tarah ''kuch log mere kingmekar ke taur par ubharne se pareshaan hai
 He then criticized state president Ramchandra Purve for the manner in which the party was run
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki party ke bheetar unhen nazarandaaj kiya ja rahaa he or apane 'rob-daab' kii baar-baar yaad dilaai
 Lalu's elder sons are projecting themselves as potential rebels
 parivaar or party donon hi isaki andekhi karne kii sthiti main nahin hai
 Tej Pratap was not given much importance earlier
 lekin ab ve apni nai chhavi gande kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Attacking opponents both outside and inside the party, they are making desperate efforts to present themselves as mass leaders in Lalu's mold
 9 july ko ve apane vidhansabha kshetra mahua gaye
 Here he spent the entire day riding on a bicycle rickshaw, sitting on the floor with Mahadalits, eating Sattu and hugging government officials over the phone and listening to the crowd speak on the speaker
 yahaan tak ki unhone ek saarvajanik handpump par rukkar snaan bhi kiya
 Many RJD people say that Tej Pratap has changed since he got married in May
 patni aishwarya roy ko unke is nae avatar kii vajah mana ja rahaa he
 Lalu has often called him a 'man with the heart of gold'
 ve tejasvi jitne vakpatu nahin hai, par jab bolte hai to dotuk or bebaak bolte hai or kai baar achaanak foot padate hai
 Tejashwi is well-mannered and clever compared to him
 bihar main vipaksh ke netaa ke taur par ve lalu prasad ke bhadra or siyaasi taur par sahi sanskaran rahe hai
 He is credited that he has won the party on his own in three by-elections held in July 2017 after Chief Minister Nitish Kumar severed his ties
 apane talkh bayanon ke baavjood tej pratap kaa tejasvi ke saath prempurna judaav he
 At the wedding in May and Lalu's birthday party in June, the two danced together
 tej pratap ne tejasvi ke liye jaldi hi dulhan khojane kaa vaada bhi kiya
 At least in front of people, they look like best friends
 tej pratap ab bhi chote bhai ko apane 'kaleje kaa tukdaa' bataate hai or tejasvi kehete hai ki bade bhai unke 'dost or maardarshak' hai
 But he has clearly pointed fingers at the way the party functioned in criticism and tweet, which is being run by his younger brother by all means in Lalu's absence
 rajd ke bade netaa kehete hai, ''unhen is baat kii jalan nahin he ki lalu ne party kii aguai ke liye tejasvi ko chunaa
 But Tej Pratap is not ready to play a secondary role
 
 
 ve barabari kaa darja chaahate hai
 "but RJD is not in a position to face this quarrel as Lok Sabha elections are due next year
" donon bhaaiyon ke bich kaa sauhaard hi tay karegaa ki rajd narendra modi or endie ke liye kitni badi chunauti pesh kar saktaa he
 "I think i will hand over the throne of Hastinapur to Arjuna and go to Dwarka
"

 kamedian kapil sharma or krishna abhishek kii bich kii dushmani jagajaahir he
 The two often make rhetoric against each other as well
 kuch samay pehle krishna abhishek ek nayaa sho lekar aae hai
 Even during the launch event of this show, Krishna had said that there is no comparison between him and Kapil
 bahan kaa khulaasa- depressant se jujh rahe hai kamedian kapil sharmahaal hi main hindustan times ko die intervyuu main krishna ne apane or kapil ke rishte ke bare main baat kii
 He said - People are bored after watching the interviews of syllabus
 agar aapako cilebs kaa intervyuu dekhnaa hoga to aap 'coffee vid karan' dekhenge
 Artists are asked the same type of questions
 isliye hamen kuch alag hona padegaa
 So we thought why not bring theater on TV
 phir se set par behosh hue kapil, film mubaarakan kii team ke saath chal rahaa tha shootsaaf he ki krishna kaa ishaara kapil ke sho kii taraf he
 Kapil only interviews the cast in his show
 krishna ne in baton kaa bhi khandan kiya ki wo safalataa ke liye kapil kii nakal karte hai
 Krishna said- i never compared myself to Kapil
 hamaara style ekadam alag he
 Kapil speaks just one liners
 main parformens detaa hum
 Does he perform for an hour in his show? On Kapil's show, Kumar Vishwas said to the women, "I perform for an hour
" hamaare bich yahi antar he
 People say that i have a problem with Kapil
 lekin aisa kuch nahin he
 i never wanted to be a stand up comedian
 lekin maine itani kamedi kar lee he ki main stand ap kamedian ke jone main chalaa gaya hum

 lokapriy mobile aplication 'watsap' par mangalvaar raat se ek afvaah ne jor pakadaa hua he ki pakistan ke purv cricket captain tathaa rajaneta imran khan kii kathith rup se goli markar hatya kar di gai he
 Although no mainstream newspaper or media house has written anything about this rumor being circulated about Imran Khan, who is called as the captain of Pakistani cricket, but not only on mobile messenger 'whatsapp' This news is being run, but rather some photographs are also being broadcast unconfirmed
 udhar, microbloging website twitor par is afvaah ko sire se nakaar diya gaya he, or 'watsap' par is farzi khabar ko prasaarit karne waalon kii aalochana bhi kii ja rahi he
 It is noteworthy that after serving Pakistani cricket for almost 20 years, Imran Khan entered politics by forming a new party 'tehreek-e-insaf' in the year 1996, although he never achieved any great success

 Imran Khan also said in a speech against the Prime Minister, "if anything happens to me, don't leave the Sharif family
 
 
 " Apart from this, Tahir ul-qadri, a religious leader of Pakistan also came up with Imran Khan and launched a campaign against Nawaz Sharif, and gave a speech among his supporters, saying, "if i get killed, my followers will be given Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , Their entire family and cabinet must be killed

 Protecting your skin from the harsh winds is a very difficult task
 bazaar main bahut se loshan or kriim maujuud hai jisase aap apni twachaa ko phir se soft bana sakate hai lekin sabase badi samasya he ki aap kis ek kriim ko chune
 The answer to this question depends on how your skin is
 aapaki skin dry, yli yaa sensitive he to har tarah kii skin ke liye alag kriim yuj kerani chahie
 Dry Skin - If your skin is dry, it means that there is a deficiency of oil in your skin, but in winter, both your skin and oil are deficient
 aap aisi kriim chune jisamen hyaluronic acid shaamil ho
 It has super hydrating properties
 oili skin-agar aap haivi kriim kaa istemaal karti hai to aapaki twachaa ke chhidr band ho jaaenge
 But this does not mean that you should not use moisturizer
 aapako jail, serum or lite formula istemaal karnaa chahie
 Sensitive Skin - If your skin is sensitive then you may have a problem of itching during the winter season
 aapako antioxident vaali or bina fregnance vaali kriim kharidni chahie
 On Wednesday, before the commencement of Parliament proceedings, there was a meeting of top leaders of the Congress Party
 baithak se nikalne ke baad sonia gandhi ne patrakaron ke sawaal ke jawaab main kaha ki ishrat jahaan ke maamle main party puri tarah se pi chidambaram ke saath he
 He has already put his side
 ye puche jane par ki bijepi kii taraf se congress netritv ko bhi nishaanaa banaaya ja rahaa he, sonia ne jawaab diya ki isamen koi nai baat nahin he
 They have been targeting the Congress ever since we were in power
 sutron ke mutabik, congress kii is baithak main ye bhi faisla liya gaya ki ishrat maamle par lag rahe aaropon kaa party jamkar jawaab degi
 Under Secretary RVS Mani will be questioned by saying that he is the same officer who said that the attack on Parliament was planned by the Vajpayee government and the Mumbai attack was planned by the UPA government
 kya bijepi aise adhikari kii baat par bharosa karnaa chaahati he
 According to the Congress, GK Pillai is making a blasphemous statement because he is on the board of directors of Adani's company
 tippaniyan It is worth noting that in a press conference held at the Congress headquarters on 29 February, on the question of changing the affidavit in the case of Ishrat, Chidambaram had clarified that on the basis of lack of evidence related to Ishrat being a terrorist, the court questioned him Were
 yah bhi kaha tha ki pehle halafanaame main chizein saaf nahin thi or ye unki jaankaree main laayaa gaya tha
 Only then was the new affidavit introduced
 congress kii taraf se buudhvaar ko enie kii 2011 main ahmedabad esaiti ko bheji gai vah chitthee bhi jari kii gai, jisamen david colman hedli ke bayaan ko court main saboot ke taur par manyata na milane kii baat kii gai thi, kyonki uskaa bayaan kahi suni baton par aadhaarit tha
 The Congress also clarified that in the affidavit filed on August 6, 2009, Ishrat was considered a Lashkar terrorist and the encounter was genuine
 lekin 7 sitambar 2009 ko metropolitain magistrate es pi tamang ne na sirf encounter ko farzi qaraar diya, balki yah bhi kaha ki ishrat or uskaa saathi javed shaikh pakistani aatanki sanghathan lashkar e taiyaba ke sadsy the, ye bataane ke liye thos saboot nahin hai
 That they came to kill Narendra Modi also does not prove that
 court ke isi faisale ko dhyaan main rakhte hue 29 sitambar ko doosraa halafanama daakhil kiya gaya

 a letter sent by the Congress on Wednesday to the NIA in 2011 to the Ahmedabad SIT was also issued, in which David Coleman Headley's statement was not recognized as evidence in the court, as his statement was heard
 was based on
 congress ne yah bhi saafe kiya ki 6 agast 2009 ko daakhil halafanaame main ishrat ko lashkar kaa aatanki or encounter ko asli mana gaya tha
 But on 7 September 2009, Metropolitan Magistrate SP Tamang not only called the encounter as fake, but also said that Ishrat and her partner Javed Sheikh were members of the Pakistani terror outfit lashkar-e-taiba
 yah bhi ki ve narendra modi ko maarane aae the ye bhi sabit nahin hota
 Keeping this decision of the court in mind, another affidavit was filed on 29 September
 aagaamee BMC chunaav ke liye shivasena ne bijepi ke saath jari 25 saal purana gathbandhan tod diya he
 Shiv Sena Party chief Uddhav Thackeray, while speaking at the office bearers in Mumbai, bluntly said that the party wasted 25 years in the alliance
 ab wo maharashtra main akele aage badhegi
 As per the fixed script, Shiv Sena did not leave any chance to fire the BJP at the gathering held at Mumbai's NSE Ground
 uddhav ne do took kaha ki, 'main elaan kar rahaa hum, aaj ke baad bhavishya main shivasena akeli maharashtra main bhagava laharaayegi
 From now on, i will not go to the coalition with a bowl at someone's door

 Nobody's begging isaki kii shuruyaat ke rup main mahanagar palika or jila parishad ke aagaamee chunaav main kahin bhi ham gathbandhan nahin karenge
 My Shiv Sena will not betray the Shiv Sena
 ab ladaai shuru ho chuki he
 Partition became the reason for ending the relationship with BJP
 bijepi kaa is chunaav main 50-50 formule ke tahat aadhi siten maangana shivasena ko nagavar gujara he
 Calling it a proposal without status, Uddhav Thackeray called it an insult to the Shiv Sena
 gauratlab he ki asia kii sabase amir mahanagar palika kii ladaai main shivasena ne bijepi ko gat chunaav ke mukaable 5 siten kam dene kaa ofer diya tha
 BJP contested 65 seats in the last election
 aise main bijepi ne bhi is prastaav ko asweekaar kar akele chunaav main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis responded immediately by tweeting after the Shiv Sena rally

 bijepi se rishte khatm karne ke liye vajah bana siton kaa bantwaaraa
 In this election, Shiv Sena has gone through the demand of half the seats under 50-50 formula in this election
 ise uddhav thakare ne bina haisiyat rakhaa prastaav qaraar dete hue shivasena kaa apmaan qaraar diya
 Significantly, in the battle of Asia's richest metropolitan municipality, Shiv Sena offered to give BJP 5 seats less than the last election
 bijepi ne pichley chunaav main 65 siten ladi thi
 In such a situation, the BJP has also decided to reject the proposal and go to the polls alone

 ek yuvak ko chalati car ke saamne dhakka dekar maarane ke maamle main aaropee kerala ke police afasar harikumar ne aatmahatya kar lee he
 On Tuesday, his body was found in his house in Kallambalam near Thiruvananthapuram
 harikumar dipti suparitendent of police (DYSP) ke pad par tainaat the
 He was attacked by some 32-year-old s in Neyyattinkara some time ago
 sanal kii hatya kaa aarope laga tha
 At that time, it was said that while moving DYSP Harikumar pushed Sanal in front of the car, due to which Sanal got hurt
 jiske baad peedit ko aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan usne dam tod diya
 Local people said that when Harikumar asked to remove Sanal's car parked on the roadside, there was a ruckus between them
 uske baad adhikari ne ek chalati car ke saamne sanal ko dhakka de diya
 After the death of Sanal, the matter caught fire
 rajya ke mukhyamantripinarai vijayanane aaropee police adhikari ko nilambit kar diya tha
 Whereas, under the supervision of ASP, orders were also given to investigate this entire incident
 ghatana ke baad aaropee dspi kii tatkaal giraftaar kii maang ko lekar logon ne sadak ko jam bhi kar diya tha
 The hearing was scheduled to take place today
 
 
 nilamban ke baad divyespi harikumar ne tamilnadu bhaagane kii koshish bhi kii thi, lekin aisa karne main wo asafal rahe
 After this, he was at home for a few days
 aaj sanal hatyakand maamle main unki jamaanat par sunwaayee bhi hone vaali thi
 But before that his body was recovered from the house
 bihar main cabinet vistaar ko lekar janata dal united (jediu) vidhayak aas lagaaein baithe hai, lekin nitish kumaar baar-baar kehete hai ki abhi is par koi vichaar nahin he
 The challenge of the opposition parties is that the day Nitish Kumar will fill all the vacant posts of ministerial post, his government will fall
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par puure rajya kii jimmedaari he, lekin saath-saath 18 vibhaagon kii jimmedaari bhi un par hai
 After breaking the alliance with BJP, the responsibility of 11 departments increased further on Nitish Kumar, who was already looking at 7 departments
 bijepi lagaataar aarope laga rahi he ki nitish kumaar aise pehle mukhyamantri hai, jo pichley do maheenon se 18 vibhaagon kii jimmedaari liye gum rahe hai, aise main vibhaagon main kya kaam ho saktaa he
 Also, the opposition also claims that Nitish Kumar's government will fall on the day the entire ministerial posts are filled
 jab gathbandhan tutaa tha, tab jediu ke vidhayakon ko aas bandhi thi ki ab unke din phirenge or wo bhi laal batti kii gaadi par ghumenge, lekin do maheene guzarane vaale hai or abhi tak unki aas adhuri he
 Most of the JDU mlas are dreaming of becoming ministers
 aise main sabhi ko pad dena nitish kumaar ke liye mushkil hi nahin, naammumkin he
 It is also not right to make anyone angry because of the majority, therefore Nitish Kumar is constantly postponing the program of expansion of Cavinet
 ravivaar ko nitish kumaar ne rajyapal se mulaakaat kii, tab aas kii kiran phooti, lekin nitish kumaar ne kaha ki wo ek aupchaarik mulaakat thi, mantrimandal vistaar ko lekar charchaa nahin hui
 However, Nitish Kumar will have to expand the cabinet today, if not today
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki 15 agast ke baad kisi din kuch ko mantri banane kaa mauka mil hi jayega

 This can be realized only by reading the poems of the great poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan, this is the biggest illusion ever

 The name of the artist who supported the lines of Bachchan's poems was Haripal Tyagi

 Haripal worked as a cartoonist in a newspaper
 baad main unhon kai shaharon main apni chitrakaari kii pradarshnee lagaai
 Famous actor Amitabh Bachchan's father Harivansh Rai used to make pictures of Bachchan's books only
 ek intervyuu ke dauraan haripal ne hi is baat kaa khulaasa kiya tha ki bachchan kii kitabon ke sketch or cover vahi banaate the
 Haripal had also shared an incident related to it
 unhone bataaya tha ki ek baar jab vah bachchan se milane unke dilli sthit ghar gaye to bachchan ne kaha ki jisane unki kitaab nahin padhi, vah unke chitra kaise bana saktaa he
 When Bachchan said this, Haripal started telling him about Toka and his books right there
 jiske baad se bachchan kii kavitaaon ke chitra banane kii jimmedaari haripal ko mil gai
 Haripal had many skills
 vah kavi, lekhak, chitrakaar, kathakaar, kala sameekshak or vyangyakaar the
 However, his way of life was reflected in the rural environment as he always preferred to stay connected with the land
 padhai ke baad unhen jab khaali samay miltaa tha to vah tasviren banaaya karte the
 Haripal had no break in writing satire
 unka vyangy 'aadmi se aadmi' tak khub prasiddh hua tha
 Haripal was often discussed for paintings on literary books
 haripal kaa janaa saahitiyik jagat ke liye ek badi kshati he

 Police started searching the girl in the entire area
 isi bich kisi ne uske bhai ko soochna di ki vah kisi ladke saath is jagah par dekhi gai he
 When the brother reached the place mentioned with the police, both boys and girls were present there
 police ne ladke ko giraftaar kar liya
 a case of kidnapping the minor was registered against him and produced in the court from where he has been sent to jail
 vahiin ladki kaa kahana he ki vah ek-duusare ko pasand karte hai
 At the first sight, the boy and the girl were beginning to love each other

 Pakistan Foreign Minister Mahmood Qureshi did not attend the meeting and it was seen as India's diplomatic victory
 bataa den ki ye baithak tab hui thi jab bharat or pakistan ke bich tanaav chal rahaa tha
 In response to the Pulwama terror attack on 14 February, India launched an airstrike at the bases of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed in Balakot, Pakistan

 ) pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa sapana agle 5 saal main desh kii iconomi 5 trillian dollar tak le janaa he
 In 2018, he first talked about making India a $ 5 trillion economy by 2025 in Davos, Switzerland
 bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne bhi yahi baat doharaai
 But in the next five years, there is no hindrance in India's becoming a $ 5 trillion economy
 yah koi mushkil cheez nahin he
 India can grow faster than this
 bijness today kii report ke mutabik, jo raftaar 5 trillian dollar iconomi banane ke liye chahie, bharat usase teji se vikaas kar rahaa he
 Despite a setback like demonetisation, India will achieve a target of $ 5 trillion by 2025 on every scale of growth (between 11 and 12% per annum) provided the rupee-dollar rate is around 70 rupees
 lekin 2024 tak bharat har vikaas paimaane par 5 trillian se thodaa dur rah saktaa he
 How the IMF or World Bank measures GDP in dollars
 ve maujuuda keemton par bharat kii jidipi se hasil hui (nominal) jidipi kii calculation karte hai
 If we look at India's GDP in 2018-19 at Rs 190 lakh crore, then this 2
 71 trillian dollar iconomi (ausatan 70 rupee prati dollar kii dar se) baithti he
 According to the report, India grew at an annual growth rate of 11 percent GDP to $ 5 trillion economy, 11 in 2024-25
 25 pratishat prati varsh kii dar se 5
 15 trillion dollars per year, 11
 5 pratishat salanaa kii dar se 5
 5 at a rate of 22 trillion and 12 percent annually
 36 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha ban saktaa he
 There is another way in which GDP is measured by constant prices
 isamen jidipi base year se judi hoti he, jo philhal 2011-12 he
 It measures 'real GDP', which does not include the effect of inflation
 sthit keemton par bharat kii jidipi kareeb 140 lakh rupee baithti he
 This is Rs 50 lakh crore less than the GDP at constant prices
 is tarah yah sirf 2 trillian dollar kii iconomi hui
 It is clear that neither the government nor IMF / World Bank is resorting to this data
 world bank kii nominal jidipi yaa maujuuda keemten sthir keemton kii salanaa mahangaai or jidipi hai
 Hence India if 7-7 by 2025
 5 pratishat salanaa kii dar se ausatan real jidipi growth rate darj karata he or mahangaai dar 4 pratishat kii range main rahati he to bharat ke liye 5 trillian dollar kii arthvyavastha banane main koi dikkat nahin aegi
 Therefore, India should see a bigger dream now

 ramalala virajman or hindu mahasabha ne is maamle main unhone supreme court ke seketry jaranal ko patr likhakar shikaayat kii he
 In which he said that the five-member bench of the Supreme Court did not say anywhere in its order that the reply on the molding of relief be filed in the seal cover
 aise main sunni vakf board ke jawaab ko sweekaar naa kiya jaae or na hi ise paanch sadasyeey peeth ke saamne rakhaa jaae
 Under the Molding of Relief in the Supreme Court, all parties related to the Ayodhya dispute filed their own replies
 isamen sunni vakf board kii ore se jaankaree he ki wo samjhaute ke liye taiyaar hai lekin duusare muslim pakshon ne isse inkaar kiya he
 On behalf of the Hindu side, the Nirmohi Akhara has said to retain their serving rights if a decision is made in favor of Ramlala or any Hindu party
 vivaadit bhoomi par mandir banane ke saath hi ramalala kii seva puja or vyavastha kii jimmedaari kaa bhi adhikaar ho
 At the same time, Ramlala Virajaman has written that the entire area for the Ram temple should be given to him
 nirmohi akhaada yaa muslim partiyon ko jameen kaa koi hissaa nahin milanaa chahie
 The Hindu Mahasabha has written that the Supreme Court should form a trust for the arrangement of the entire temple on the construction of the Ram temple at the birthplace in Ayodhya
 agar muslim paksh kii baat karen to sutron ke mutabik muslim paksh ne kaha ki unhen vahi raahat chahie jo unhone bahes ke dauraan kahi thi
 That is, they want the Babri Masjid with condition before the demolition
 vahiin, sunni vakf board kii ore jaankaree ai he ki wo samjhaute ke paksh main hai
 In the Ayodhya case, the Shia Waqf Board said, 'we have also spoken through the Molding of Relief to give up the claim on the land given to the Muslims from the High Court
 vahaan mandir bane
 The Shia Waqf Board on 'molding of Relief' also filed a written reply in the Supreme Court
 shiya vakf board ne kaha vivaadit jameen par bhagwaan ram kaa mandir bane, jameen par malikana haq sunni vakf board kaa nahin, balki shiya vakf board kaa he
 In such a situation, a part which the High Court has given to the Sunni Waqf Board should be given to the Hindu side
 tamaam pakshon ke jawaab par gaur karne se ek baat saamne aa rahi he ki kuch pakshon ke rukh main thodaa lacheelaapan he
 The Sunni Waqf Board is also ready for an agreement
 philhal supreme court ke jaj bahes ke baad faisla likh rahe honge
 But before that decision, the response from all the parties will also be considered
 isaki bhi puri ummid he
 Union Minister Nitin Gadkari has advised his fellow leaders
 unhone kaha ki netaaon ko duusare kshetron main dakhal nahin dena chahie,balkivishvavidhyalayon, shaikshanik sansthaanon, sahitya or kavy jagat ke logon ko apane maamle khud nipataane dena chahie
 Nitin Gadkari said this at the closing ceremony of the annual Marathi Sahitya Sammelan in Yavatmal
 aapako bataa den ki yah sammelanlekhika nayantara sahagal ko diya gaya nyauta waapas lene kii vajah sevivaadon main rahaa he
 At the event, Gadkari said that during the Emergency, Marathi writers like Durga Bhagwat and PL Deshpande used to gather more crowds than political rallies
 ye donon log chunaavon ke baad sahitya ke kshetra main laute the
 He did not even demand political appointments like Rajya Sabha membership '

 dilli kii retail mandiyon main ek kilo tamaato kii keemat 80 se 100 rupee prati kilo pahunch gai he
 Not only this, the prices of other vegetables have also started touching the sky
 isse aam aadmi kii jeb par dabaav badhata ja rahaa he
 In the retail mandis of Dardi, which are continuously growing, the normal tomato is getting Rs 80 per kg, then for the local tomatoes, you have to pay Rs 100
 subjiyon ke daam badhane lagaataar badhate hi ja rahe hai
 Not only Delhi, Dehradun, Noida and other places are also seeing an increase in the prices of vegetables
 bemausham barish jimmedaarmandi main sabji bechney waalon kokehna he ki pehle tamaato ke jitne trek bharkar aate the, unki sankhya kaaphi kam ho gai he
 Unseasonal rains in some areas are being attributed to this
 in ilaakon main barish ne tamaato kii fasal kharaab kii he
 Due to this supply has been disrupted, but this is not the only reason to increase prices
 bemausam barish yaa sarkaar kii laaparvaahee?ye jarur he kibemausam barishne tamaato kii keemton ko badhaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he, lekin sarkaar kii laaparvaahee bhi iske liye jimmedaar he
 In fact, agricultural experts had already issued a warning that the kharif yield of onion-tomato is expected to be low in the current season, despite the pace of the south-west monsoon, but despite this the government vacated the cold storage
 kam paidaavaar kii chetavanee ko nahin di tarjihais chetavanee ke baad yah jaruri tha ki desh ko cold storage main rakhi fasal ko export karne se zyada tarjeeh sambhaal kar rakhane par di jaati jisase maujuuda samay main badhati keemton ko lagaam lagane ke liye stock kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa, lekin aisa nahin hua
 Since August, Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has said that rising prices will be controlled soon
 unhone bataaya ki jaise hi tamaato kii aapurti badhegi, keemton main kami aani shuru ho jaaegi
 However, in the month of August also the government had given a similar assurance
 agast maheene main bhi sarkaar ne kaha tha ki keemten niyantran main aa jaaengi, lekin aisa nahin hua

 ( input bhashaa se) Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray has attacked former President APJ Abdul Kalam by writing an editorial in Saamna
 masalaa kalam ke taaja khulaase se judaa hua he, jisamen unhone kaha he sonia ko piem banane se unhone nahin roka tha
 Thackeray has said that through such revelations, Kalam has made his own clothes and has hurt his own image
 thakare ne likhaa he ki sonia ne bahut prayaas kiye the piem banane ke lekin ban nahin pain, isiilie ek gunge or bahere vyakti ko piem bana diya
 Thackeray says that people believed that Kalam had prevented Sonia from becoming the Prime Minister, that is why people had respect for him, but Kalam has exposed himself and jumped into the trench and broken his hands and feet
 thakare likhte hai ki kalam missile main ke taur par jane jate hai, lekin ab jo unhone visphot karaayaa he, wo desh ke liye sharmnaak he
 Thackeray has written in the face that no one should call Kalam a missile man because he kept the truth hidden for ten years

 sachin tendulkar par vivaadaaspad bayaan dene ke ek din baad pakistan ke purv captain shahid afridi ne ravivaar ko kaha ki bharat ke is champion ballebaaj ko unke certificate kii jarurat nahin he or vah khud sachin ke bahut bade mureed hai
 Afridi said, Sachin Tendulkar is a very good batsman and the world considers him to be the iron of his fun
 unhen mere yaa kisi or ke certificate kii jarurat nahin he
 His record is a testimony to what kind of cricketer he is
 vivaadon se ghire rahane vaale afridi ne apane purv saathi khilaadi shoeb akhtar ke is daawey kaa samarthan kiya ki sachin tendulkar unki raftaar ke aage asahaj the
 Afridi said that he saw Sachin trembling in front of Shoaib
 afridi ne is bayaan par kaayam rahete hue kaha, main isse mukar nahin rahaa hum ki maine aisa dekha tha
 He is the talk of Kolkata Test on the 1999 India tour in which Shoaib dismissed Sachin and Dravid
 vah sirf ek match kii baat thi lekin uske baad sachin ne shoeb kii jamkar dhunaai bhi kii jisamen 2003 vishwa cap shaamil he
 He said, Shoaib was new at that time and he had amazing speed
 duniya kaa koi ballebaaj uske saamne tik nahin paata tha
 In that one match, i saw Sachin getting nervous as i was standing on square leg
 maine koi galat baat nahin kahi he
 Afridi said, this can happen to any batsman
 vah shoeb kaa din tha or mujhe apane kahe par koi malaal nahin he
 Sachin was nervous in that match but the media made this point unnecessary
 achche wicket par achche gendbaaj kaa saamana karnaa kisi ke liye bhi mushkil ho saktaa he, phir chaahe vah don bradmen hi kyon naa ho
 In that Test played in Kolkata in 1999, Shoaib bowled Sachin in the first innings without giving him a chance to open the account
 dravid donon pariyon main shoeb kaa shikaar hue the
 The former Pakistan fast bowler took eight wickets in that match on his first tour to India
 afridi ne kaha, mere kehane kaa yah matlab nahin he ki shoeb kaa palada sachin par baari rahaa he
 Everyone knows how many sixes Sachin has flown on Shoaib later
 lekin kabhi koi din ballebaaj kaa nahin hota
 In a match against Zimbabwe in Peshawar, i was out on zero while at that time i was in great form and there was a weak team in front
 unhone khud ko sachin kaa jabardast mureed bataate hue kaha, main sachin kaa kaayal hum jo achche cricketer hi nahin behtareen insaan bhi hai
 i did not put a photo of any other cricketer in the drawing room of my house, but have framed the picture with Sachin's autograph
 yah poochne par ki kya is maamle main vah sachin se baat karenge, unhone kaha, sachin mahaan cricketer hai or vah samajhate honge ki maine kuch galat nahin kaha he
 Afridi described the Indian media as infuriated and said that the media should work towards improving relations between the two countries, but the Indian media is not doing so
 unhone kaha, ham is saal vishwa cap khilne gaye tab bhi bhartiya media ne pakistani team ke bare main nakaaratmak khabaren chalaai
 We have received a lot of love from the Indian people and there is no dearth of Indians in Pakistan too, especially those who love Sachin
 media ko nakaaratmak khabaron se bachanaa chaiye
 Afridi, who retired from international cricket, said about the possibility of a comeback, inshaallah, i will return soon
 mujhe lagata he ki main do teen saal or khel saktaa hum
 The all-rounder, who recently met the President and PCB mentor Asif Ali Zardari, said, "I am not going to plead with anyone but i think the conditions will be favorable and i will be able to play for Pakistan again

 menka gandhi pilibhit se 6 baar saansad rahi hai or 2009 main aanwala loksabhaa seat se saansad chuni gai thim
 Aaj Tak had a special conversation with him about election preparations and the politics of the grand alliance
 is kram main menka gandhi ne kaha ki sultanpur seat se unke pati sanjay gandhi do baar or varun gandhi pichhali baar chunaav jeet chuke hai
 This time, he and the workers are working hard once again on this difficult seat
 menka gandhi ne apni jeet kaa bharosa diya lekin iskaa kitna antar hoga, iske bare main kuch nahin kaha
 Maneka Gandhi said that 'I have no threat from the joint candidate of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance and i am winning the election
 mayawati kii party ke bare main ham sab jaanate hai
 We know this thing for many years, she sells tickets with money
 is baar sultanpur main 15 karod main tikat bechaa gaya he
 Maneka Gandhi said that 'mayawati sells tickets, i dare speak for the first time
 mujhe lagata he ab or bhi log bolenge or ye ek bada chunavi mudda banegaa kyonki paise se tikat kharidkar kaise kaise log jitkar aate hai
 In response to a question on Priyanka Gandhi, Maneka Gandhi said, "they will not have any influence in the election because they do not have workers
" chunaav dar chunaav kaaryakarta kam hote ja rahe hai
 On the other hand they have no issue
 isliye unka koi prabhaav nahin hoga
 When Rahul Gandhi contested from Wayanad, he said that 'any person can contest from two seats or more
 main sultanpur se chunaav lard rahi hum, iskaa asar amethi or raiberli main hoga
 Right now i am busy in my election in Sultanpur myself
 party ne abhi mujhe amethi or raibareli main prachaar ke liye kaha nahin he, kahegi to prachaar karuungi
 'maneka Gandhi told Aaj Tak that no matter how much Rahul Gandhi tries, he can never become Prime Minister
 agar koi karishma ho jaae to main kah nahin sakati hum
 'he further said that day by day our situation is getting better than before
 pichhali baar se zyada siten jitkar ham sarkaar banane ja rahe hai
 Varun will win the election easily from Pilibhit because i have done a lot of work there, gave a lot of love to people
 ' menka gandhi ne kaha ki 'amethi or raibareli se koun seat jitegaa, ye main bhavishyavaanee nahin kar sakati kyonki main pilibhit se chunaav lard rahi hoti to ye nahin kah sakati thi bareli main kya hone vaala he
 This time on the insistence of Maneka Gandhi and Varun Gandhi, BJP has swapped Lok Sabha seats for both
 menka gandhi ko sultanpur se or varun gandhi ko pilibhit se party ne tikat diya he
 Varun Gandhi won the election from Sultanpur in 2014 by more than 2 lakh 28 thousand votes
 is baar menka gandhi ke kareebi netaaon kaa daawa he ki sultanpur se menka gandhi is baar 4 lakh voton se chunaav jeetne ja rahi hai
 Maneka Gandhi said in her election speech that she had a very old association with Sultanpur
 menka gandhi bataati hai ki unke bete varun gandhi ne bhi sultanpur ko apana karm kshetra banaaya or vikaas ke bade bade kaam kiye
 Now she herself has come to serve Sultanpur this time
 menka gandhi apane bhaashan main modi sarkaar kii garib kalyaan yojanaon kaa bakhaan karti hai ki modi sarkaar ne garib logon ke ayushmaan bharat yojana ke tahat ilaaj ke liye paanch lakh rupye die, mudra yojana main kaam dhandhe ke liye lone di gai he
 The Modi government has given gas under the Pucca Ghar, Ujjwala scheme, and has given free electricity connection to the poor households which did not have electricity
 samaajawaadee party or bispi ke gathbandhan ke sanyukt ummidavaar par hamalaa bolte hue menka gandhi ne kaha ki aapke taraazoo main ek taraf bandookdhaari he or duusari taraf maa
 Now you have to decide who to choose because the gunman bought the ticket for Rs 15 crore
 ab aap hi sochen ki agar koi 15 karod main tikat kharidega to wo isaki recovery aapaki jeb se karegaa
