 Standard SMS Charges Applicable European countries have united against US President Donald Trump's protectionist policy and stance on climate change
 dilachasp baat yah he ki america ke sabase kareebi dost britain se bhi europea desh behad khafa hai
 Europe's politics have been hot since Britain's decision to secede from the European Union
 europea deshon ne saaf kaha he ki agar britain europea sangh se alag hota he, to usko iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 At the same time, European countries have rallied against America
 G-7 or nato ke sahyogi trump se behad naaraaz hai
 So now European countries are determined to isolate America and Britain
 aise main in europea deshon ke paas asia kii ore dekhne ke sivaay koi rasta nahin bachaa he
 The biggest challenge facing Western countries is to upgrade their economy and balance with Asia
 aise main ye desh bharat or china kii ore nigaah gadaaye hue hai
 Inviting Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang and then Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on behalf of German Chancellor Angela Merkel was part of this strategy
 america ke jalwaayu parivartan par rukh, vyapaar niti or sangrakshanvaadi niti se khafagerman chancelar angela merclane europe ko aatmanirbhar banane kii thaan lee he
 So she is now focusing on Asia to counter US President Trump's 'america First Policy'
 dilachasp baat yah he ki haal hi ke dinon main germany ke saath anya europea deshon kaa bhi bharat kii ore se jhukaav badha he
 These countries feel that India can become their owner in Asia
 ise bhi padhieh US se khafa germany ab bharat ke kareeb, rang laaegi modi kii 'mek in india' diplomasichin nahin, bharat he vikalpapashchimi desh beshak china ko saath lekar chalane kii baat kah rahe hon, lekin china ko lekar unki chintaaen jagajaahir hai
 China's ambitious 'one Belt One Road' project has also raised the concern of Western countries
 lihaaja china se santulan baitaane ke liye in deshon ke paas bharat hi ek vikalp he
 In such a situation, now India is more important than European for China
 haalanki china europea nivesh ko lubhaane ke liye purajor koshish kar rahaa he, lekin europea desh uske shikanje main itani aasaani se nahin aaenge
 The reason for this is that China has a very bad history regarding trade and investment
 vahiin, bharat bhi china kii 'van belt van road' pariyojna se nipatane ke liye asia main europea nivesh ko badhanaa chahta he
 PM Modi is trying hard to woo foreigners, especially western investors
 america main satta badalane ke baad modi kii 'mek in india' diplomasi rang laati najar aa rahi he
 Prior to Modi's visit, German newspapers prominently highlighted that German investors were keen to invest in India and were eagerly awaiting Modi's visit
 germany ke samarthan main aayaa bharat29 may ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ne germany kaa daura kiya tha
 He had met and had a chance meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel

 In an interview given to a newspaper in Germany, PM Modi said that India fully supports the German agenda on the G-20
 bharat or china donon hi G-20 ke sadsy desh hai
 In such a situation, it is necessary for India to bring Germany into its court

 On 19 September, the Center told the apex court that Delhi's administration could not be left alone with the Delhi government as it had an "extraordinary" status as the capital of the country
 centre ne adaalat se kaha tha ki sheersh adaalat kii samvidhan peeth ne spasht rup se kaha tha ki dilli ko rajya kaa darja nahin diya ja saktaa he
 The Center had said that one of the basic issues is whether the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) has legislative and executive powers over the 'services'
 dilli sarkaar ne pehle adaalat ko bataaya tha ki unke paas jaanch kaa ek ayog gathit karne kii kaaryakari shakti he

 ) The temporary suspension has raised a silver lining for the troubled Indian Boxing Federation (IABF) as the International Boxing Association (AIBA) has asked it to conduct the re-election and amend its constitution to lift the ban
 iabf ke varisht upaadhyaksh brigadier pike muralidharan raja ne armenia ke erevan main eibie adhyaksh da
 After the meeting Ching Kuo Wu said that the suspension would not last 'long'
 eibie ne bhartiya olympic sangh par antarrashtriya olympic samiti ke pratibandh or sitambar main hue iabf ke chunaav main ‘sambhavit herpher’ ko dekhte hue bhartiya mukkebaaji mahasang ko shuukravaar ko nilambit kar diya tha
 Raja said that when the IABF completes the instructions of AIBA, the global body of boxing will remove the suspension imposed on it as soon as the ban on IOA is lifted
 unhone kaha, ‘eibie adhyaksh ke saath meri vistrut charchaa hui jinhone sabase pehle saaf kiya ki antarrashtriya mahasang bharat ke khilaaf nahin he
 They are very happy with the way things are going
 nilamban kaa praathmik kaaran ioe par laga iosi kaa pratibandh he or kyonki eibie ko chunaav ke bare main kuch shikaayatein mili thi isliye unhone isaki jaanch karaane kaa bhi faisla kiya he
 "the king said," i made it clear to him that the elections held in September were transparent and were done according to our constitution
 padaadhikariyon kaa chayan sarvasammati se kiya gaya, haalanki kuch logon kii kuch shikaayatein ho sakati hai, lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin ki chunaavon main herapheri kii gai
 'he said,' AIBA has now asked us to amend our constitution and make it according to the constitution of AIBA
 saath hi eibie ke paryvekshak kii maujuudagi main dobaaraa chunaav karaae jaaen
 Once we do this, AIBA will withdraw our suspension along with the IOC ban on IOA as this is the primary reason for our suspension
 ’eibie ke samvidhan ke mutabik adhyaksh teen kaarykaal se adhik pad par bana nahin rah saktaa lekin anya padaadhikariyon ke kaarykaal or aayu ko lekar koi seemaa nahin he
 Raja said that to satisfy AIBA, the IABF would have to conduct elections free of any government interference
 iabf ko doharaa jhatka laga tha jab eibie ke nilamban ke baad khel mantralay ne bhi isaki manyata radd kar di thi or dobaaraa chunaav kii pushti karne ke liye 15 din kaa samay diya tha
 In the IABF election held in September, outgoing president Abhay Singh Chautala was retained in the federation as the nominated chairman while he completed three terms as chairman
 chautaala ko iosi ke nilamban ke baavjood ioe kaa adhyaksh bhi chunaa gaya he
 Chautala said that the IABF would soon hold a general assembly meeting to discuss aiba's directives and decide on future action

 Sanjay Singh had demanded that the report that has been conducted in Delhi about water, should be given to us

 yahaan tak kaha ja rahaa he ki yah dilli ko badnaam karne kii sajeesh he
 My point in this regard is that every citizen of the country should get clean drinking water, it is the responsibility of every state government and central government
 ''patr main paswan ne aage likhaa he, ''aapke (arvind kejariwal) dwaara die gaye suzav ke anusaar ek sanyukt team kaa gathan karte hue dilli ke bhinn-bhinn kshetron se pani ke namoonay ekatra kar kisi bhi adhikrut jaanch agency se gunvattta kii jaanch karvaa lee jaae
 i am nominating two senior BIS officers, Mr

 Dharamvir Bharti's classic novel 'god of crimes' will now be available in English as well
 penguin iskaa angreji anuwaad 'chander and sudhaa' naam se lekar aayaa he
 This immortal love story has been translated by journalist Poonam Saxena
 'gunahon kaa devtaa' shuruaati daur ke sarvaadhik padhe jane vaale upanyaason main se ek he
 It has a magnificent depiction of the latent and supernatural form of love
 kahani kaa nayak chander sudhaa se pyaar to karata he, lekin sudhaa ke pita ke ahsaanon or uske adarsh milakar aisi sthitiyaan paidaa karte hai ki vah apane man kii baat sudhaa se nahin kah paata
 In the eyes of Sudha, he wants to remain a god and this is what happens
 antat: sudhaa se uskaa naata vaisaa hi he, jaisaa ek devtaa or bhakt kaa hota he
 Chander's conflict with love remains in most parts of the novel
 nateeja yah hota he ki sudhaa kii shaadi kahin or ho jaati he or ant main use duniya chhodkar janaa padataa he
 In the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Election 2017 results, BJP won a massive majority with 312 seats out of 403
 lambey arse ke baad kisi party ko itnaa bahumat mila
 That too for a party that is ruling in the center
 aisi sthiti main aarthik vikaas kii disha main anya rajyon se pichad chuke uttar pradesh ko tej raftaar daudane se rokane vaali sabhi raajnneetik baadhaaen dur ho gayi
 After this overwhelming majority, BJP decided the formula of Three cms (1 Chief Minister and 2 Deputy Chief Ministers) for rapid development of the state
 yogi adityanath ko rajya kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya or keshav prasad maury va dinesh sharma upmukhyamantri bane
 This three-cm government is completing a year, so this is the right time to take stock of how effective this formula of BJP proved to be
 uttar pradesh main bijepi ke thri siem experiment ko isliye bhi khaas mana gaya ki jahaan desh ke sabase bade rajya main prashasnic gatividhiyon ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye yah formula behad kargar hoga
 At the same time, with the formula of three Chief Ministers, BJP will also be able to balance ethnic mathematics in the state
 keshav prasad maury anya pichhadi jatiyon ko sadhakar rakhenge to dinesh sharma se rajya main brahmanon ko saadhane kii ummid rakhi gai
 At the same time, Chief Minister Adityanath became the second Kshatriya leader of the BJP on the basis of caste, who took command of the state, but he was expected to convey the message of Hindutva in the state, keeping him out of caste
 rajya main jaateey sameekaran ko sanbhaalane main thri siem formula kitna kargar rahaa yah to agle saal hone vaale loksabhaa upachunaavon ke nateezon se tay hoga
 But how successful the Yogi government has been in bringing good days in the state can be gauged
 ise padhein: ek saal baad mukhyamantri yogi ne upi ko diya vikaas kaa gujarat modelhal main uttar pradesh ke nikaay chunaavon ke baad lakhanu main sangh kii ek mahatvapurn baithak main mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ke kaarykaal kii samiksha baithak hui
 The meeting held at the Chief Minister's residence was attended by Yogi and his two Deputy Chief Ministers, as well as State Party President Mahendra Nath Pandey and Dattatreya Hosabole from the RSS and Krishna Gopal
 is baithak main sangh dwaara yogi sarkaar ke khilaaf pramukh aapattiyon main rajya main afasarshahi, kuch mantralayon main bhrashtachar, rajya sarkaar or party padaadhikariyon main matbhed samet centre sarkaar dwaara chalaai ja rahi vikaas yojanaon main prashasnic laaparvaahee ke maamle pramukh rahe
 The corridors of power also claim that during one year the Chief Minister's Office in Uttar Pradesh has not been able to complete the formation of its team for smooth functioning in the state
 iskaa andaja isi baat se lagata he ki july 2017 main rajya main lagu jiesti lagu karne kii jimmedaari khud mukhyamantri adityanath ke jimme rahi
 But the Yogi government has not made any changes after assuming power in the department engaged for this work
 lihaaja is vibhaag kaa kaamkaaj ek saal bitne ke baad bhi unheen adhikariyon ke jimme he jinhen purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ke kaarykaal main niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Read this: Will Yogi's branding shine like Modi's Gujarat? Know what is the second important issue of bureaucracy during the plan union meeting
 pradesh ke prashasnic halkon main bhi daawa kiya jaataa he ki yogi raaj main darasal iees raaj chal rahaa he
 Where the top political leadership has been isolated in the name of ethnic balance and smooth administration
 vahiin vaastaviktaa yah bhi he ki rajya main mukhyamantri yogi sarvopari hai or sucharu prashasan main thri siem formule kaa koi yogadan nahin he
 This is the effect of the fact that there is no hearing of the party in the government, officers are dominated in the ministries and reports of this stalemate are continuously reaching the union
 lihaaja, aisa sthiti main kaha ja saktaa he ki uttar pradesh main thri siem formula yadi sucharu prashasan ke liye laayaa gaya he to philhal to ye apane makasad main kaamyaab nahin hota dikh rahaa he

 Apple's 4-inch iphone SE has been launched
 company ke mutabik bharat main isaki shuruaati keemat 39,000 rupee hogi
 However, after the launch event, the company mistakenly valued it at Rs 30,000
 jaahir he 39,000 rupee main yah phaayde kaa sauda to nahin he
 But it is possible that in India it is available at a lower price than MRP
 koch ke ek retailor itnet Infocom ne daawa kiya he ki vahbharat main iphone SE ko isaki mrppara bechney kii bajaay 30,000 rupee main hi bechega
 From this it can be expected that after a few days or months of arrival in India, it starts selling for Rs 30,000
 retailor ne 30,000 rupee main bechney kaa kiya daawalithnet Infocom ke twitor handle se likhaa gaya he,' ham aashwaasan dete hai ki may tak iphone SE 30,000 rupee main bechenge'i can assure you we will be selling SE like hot cakes at 30K pricing in May— ITNET (@itnetinfocom)march 22, 2016yah bhi padhein: iphone SE aapke liye ghate kaa sauda
 
 iphone 6S bhi MRP se kam keemat par miltaa haikai baar bharat main smartfones MRP se kaaphi kam keemat par beche jate hai
 Retailers have a big hand in doing this because they try to lure more and more customers by selling them at a lower price
 yahi vajah he ki iphone 6S bazaar or i-commers website par 42,000 main mil rahaa he jabaki isaki MRP 60,000 rupee se bhi zyada he

 If the song is entertaining, people enjoy it
 vaise praachi ne ab tak ek bhi item number nahin kiya he
 The comments praachi ekta kapur ke tivi sho 'kasam se' main abhinay kar ghar-ghar main lokapriy ho gai thim

 He said, people tell me why don't you do something different
 main kahati hum ki main ek gambhir film main nrity nahin kar sakati
 You have to act according to the character you are playing and everything is around it
 maine jis tarah kii filmein kii hai unamem aisa koi avasar nahin tha
 By the way Prachi says that she has no complaints about her career
 praachi ne kaha, item numbers ek abhinetri ke kariyar main bahut phydemand hote hai

 You can say anything
 geet manoranjak ho, to log iskaa lutf lete hai
 By the way Prachi has not done a single item number so far

 film kaa naam:sultandiarector:ali abbaas jafarstar cast:salmaan khan, anoushka sharma, randeep huda, amit saivadhi:2 ghanta 50 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:3
 The 5 stars finally arrived on 6 July and Salman Khan's film 'sultan' was released
 pehali baar salmaan ne is film main anoushka sharma or diarector 'ali abbaas jafar' ke saath kaam kiya he
 Will Salman's magic once again go to the box office like 'bajrangi Bhaijaan' and 'kick'? Let's find out
 kahanefilm kii kahani haryana ke rahane valesultan ali khan (salmaan khan)kii he jisaki mulaakaat jab arafa (anoushka sharma) se hoti he to uski raceling dekhakar sultan bhi ek resler banane kii chaah rakhane lagata he kyonki uske hisaab se ek resler kii hi shaadi, resler se ho sakati he
 Meanwhile, there are many ups and downs in the story, due to which the personal and professional life of Sultan is greatly affected and ultimately Sultan fights an important wrestling to prove himself for a particular reason, Delhi's businessman Akash (amit Saad ) And coach (randeep Hooda) help him a lot for his comeback
 ab kyasultan duniya ke saamne khud ko sabitkar paane main sakasham ho paata he? iskaa pataa aapako theatre tak jaakar hi chal paaegaa
 The scriptfilm's story is based on Wrestler's life but during filming seems to be quite lengthy, with a series of events taking place that present and pass with flashbacks
 interval ke baad thodi boriyat bhi hone lagati he, yahi kaaran he kii film ko editing ke saath or bhi crisp kiya ja saktaa tha
 Although the locations and cinematography are worth a compliment
 salmanaki maujuudagi film ko or bhi darshneey banaati he
 The fight sequences are amazing as well as the cinematography is tremendous
 abhinayasalmaan khanke shaareerik badlaav ko dekhakar lagata he kii unhone film ke liye jabardast mehnat kii he or wo parde par najar bhi aati he
 It is a treat to see Musselman, Matt and then fight in the ring
 vahiin anoushka sharma ne bhi 'arafa' kaa kirdaar bakhubi nibhaayaa he or screen par khub jachati hai
 The film also stars Amit Saad, Randeep Hooda and the rest of the co-stars
 salmaan or anoushka ke hariyaanvi samvaad bhi kaabil e tarif hai
 Weak link The weak link of the film is its length
 film ko achche tareeke se edit karke chota or crisp kiya ja saktaa tha
 Although the film will earn a lot because it has got a weekend of 5 days, but according to that the film could have been made even more cut-to-cut
 sangitafilm kaa sangeet acha he
 Vishal Shekhar has composed the lyrics according to the pace of the story, and the background score looks even better during wrestling
 tital trek puri film ke dauraan urja bharta he
 Why see Salman's presence can be seen for the exciting fight sequence and Sultan's story

 Ravija said, this harmful relationship of students to the Internet for other things other than classroom work also calls into question the plan to motivate students to use laptops in class
 emesau main manovigyaan kii essosiet professor evam adhyayan kii sah-lekhika kimberli phen ne kaha ki shodhakartaaon ne ek ghante 50 minute ke lacture kaa aayojan kiya tha jisamen 507 chaatro ne hissaa liya

 lagbhag 400 saal tak barf ke andar puri tarah se dhakaa hua baba kedarnath kaa mandir jise barahawein jyotirling ke rup main puja jaataa he, jisaki mahima aprampar he
 Today the Prime Minister of the country Narendra Modi has arrived to see her
 chaaron taraf barf ke pahaad or do taraf se mandakini or saraswati nadiyon ke bichon bich khadaa shiv kaa ye anokhaa mandir 2013 main behad bhayaavah or vinaashkari aapadaa ko jhel chukaa he or na jane or bhi kai choti badi aapadaaon ko jhelane vaale baba kedaar ke is dham main baba kii aisi mahima he ki kabhi is mandir kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin ho paaya, mandir ke andar prachin kaal se hi devi-devataaon kii sundar pratimaayein hai
 The doors of Kedarnath, open to devotees, started the Char Dham Yatra, along with this, the temple of Bhaironathji can be seen here, the tomb of Adishakaracharya and Gandhi Sarovar can also be seen
 kaise or kab hui baba kedaar kii sthapana or kab hote hai baba ke darshanpuraanon main varnit manyataon ke anusaar mahabharat kii ladaai ke baad pandavon ko jab apane hi bhaaiyon ke maare jane par baari dukh hua to ve pashchaatap karne ke liye kedaar kii isi bhoomi par aa pahunche, kehete hai unke hi dwaara is mandir kii sthapana hui
 Opening the doors of heaven, badrinath-kedarnath: Visions of Lord Shiva in the Nirbhri valley of Kedarnath make an atheist a believer, while confiding the believer with the ultimate faith and make him closer to the divine
 kedarnath pahunchane ke liye gaurikund se 15 kilometre kii paidal yatra kerani padati he
 However, this distance has increased somewhat after the 2013 disaster
 kedarnath ke darshan praat: 6 se 2 or shaam 3 se 5 baje tak kiye ja sakate hai
 Before the Rakshabandhan in August, the Shravani Annakoot fair is held here
 kapaat band hone ke din vishesh samadhi shankaracharya kii puja hoti he
 Kedarnath also reflects the spirit of renunciation
 haalanki aapadaa ke baad se yahaan shankaracharya kii samadhi nahin he ye samadhi aapadaa main bah gai thi
 Apart from Baba Kedar, four parts of Shiva are worshiped in different places
 unka naabhi pradesh madmaheshwar main, bhujaaen tungnath main mukh rudranath main or jataaen kalpeshwar main puji jaati he
 All these forms of Shiva including Kedarnath are worshiped as Panchkedar
 kapaat band hone se lekar khulne tak kedarnath kii doli ukhimath main le jaai jaati he jahaan 6 maheene tak unke darshan ukhimath sthit mandir main hi ho pate hai, jahaan bhakt unke darshan kaa laabh lete hai
 See in the pictures, the destruction of Kedarnath is there, so worship of this part is done here
 kaha jaataa he ki jab pandav yahaan aaye to bhagwaan shiv unase khafa the wo nahin chaahate the ki pandav unke darshan kar saken, lekin pandavo ko to bhagwaan shankar ke darshan karne kii maano jid thi
 This was the reason that Shiva took the form of a river
 pandavo se chupane ke liye bhagwaan shiv jaise hi pataal main jane lage vaise hi pandavon ne bhagwaan ke nadi swaroop ke peeche kaa hissaa pakad liya, lekin tab tak bhagwaan shiv aadhe pataal main ja chuke the, tabhi se bhagwaan ke pichley hisse kii puja kedaar main or unke mukh rup kii puja nepal main pashupati nath mandir ke rup main kii jaati he
 Kedarnath temple is built in which style, this Dham of Baba Kedar is built in Katyuhari style
 iske nirmaan main bhure rang ke bade pattharon kaa prayog bahutayat main kiya gaya he
 The roof of the temple is made of wood, on which the gold urn is placed
 mandir ke bahari dwaar par paharedaar ke rup main shiv ke sabase priy nandi kii vishalkay pratimaa bani hui he
 The Kedarnath temple is divided into three parts
 pehla-garbhagrih, doosraa-darshan mandap jahaan par darshanarthi ek bade pragon main khadey hokar puja karte hai, teesraa- sabha mandap, is jagah par sabhi tirthayatri jamaa hote hai
 Pilgrims here offer prayers to Lord Ganesha, Parvati, Vishnu and Lakshmi, Krishna, Kunti, Draupadi, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva along with Riddhi Siddhi besides Lord Shiva

 This is revealed in a new book by a former diplomat

 bhartiya videsh seva ke 1974 batch ke adhikari dogra sanyukt raashtra kii rome main aadhaarit agenciyon ke bharat ke sthai pratinidhi rahane ke alaava italy, romania, albania or san merino main rajdoot rah chuke hai
 She described Benazir Bhutto as a woman of 'liberal temperament' and wrote that Benazir's western education made her more acceptable in her relationship with the outside world
 dogra likhte hai, 'yah sach he ki vah nichle darje kii khufia gapshap se prabhavit thim, lekin yah bhi sach he ki kuch maukon par vah sena ke khilaaf apane rukh par kaayam raheen
 Due to this, the Kargil conflict was averted at least once during his tenure
 ' Citing an interview with Benazir, Dogra wrote how Benazir rejected the then DGMO Major General Pervez Musharraf's idea of such a campaign
 musharraf ne pakistan ke jang jeetne or srinagar par kabja karne kii sambhaavnaaen jataate hue ek suhaani si tasviir pesh karne kii koshish kii, lekin benazir ne inkaar kar diya
 According to Dogra, this expression of Benazir was a rare incident in which a Pakistani leader had warned a military general in this way

 According to the book published by Rupa Prakashan, 'nawaz Sharif looked quite uncomfortable when he was about to hug Vajpayee as he came close to the bus

 ek news channel se baatcheet ke dauraan peedit chaatra ke dost ne bataaya ki 16 disambar kii raat haivaaniyat vaali ghatana ke baad bhi unki dost jeena chaahati thi
 No one came forward for help, he said, adding that when the six accused threw him out of the bus, no one came forward to help him
 yahaan tak ki police kii teen-teen pisiar vine ai or police thanon ko lekar uljhi rahi
 It took more than two hours to take him to the hospital
 unhone kaha ki 16 disambar se virodh-pradarshan ho rahe hai
 People are on the streets against gang rape
 unhone kaha, ‘is bhayaavah ghatana par media main bahut sari chijen ai hai or log iske bare main alag-alag baaten kar rahe hai
 i want to tell people what happened to us that night
 main bataanaa chahta hum ki maine or meri dost ne us raat kin-kin mushkilon kaa saamana kiya
 'hopefully people will get lessons', he hoped that other people will learn lessons from this incident and come forward to save the life of another
 unhone kaha ki chah aropiyon ne 16 disambar kii raat unhen bas main chadhane ke liye pralobhan diya
 The victim's friend told, "the bus had black glass and curtains
 bas main savaar log pehle bhi shaayad aparaadh main shaamil the

 We also gave them 20 rupees as rent
 iske baad ve meri dost par coment karne lage

 They dragged my friend before i fainted
 ’ peedita ke dost ne bataaya, ‘hamen bas se phenkane se pehle aparaadh ke sakshya mitaane ke liye unhone hamaare mobile chhine or kapade faad die
 'the victim's friend told,' From where they boarded us in the bus, after that they kept us moving around for two and a half hours
 ham chilla rahe the
 We wanted our voice to reach people outside, but they had switched off the lights inside the bus
 yahaan tak ki meri dost unke saath ladi
 He tried to save me
 meri dost ne 100 number doyal kar police ko bulaane kii koshish kii lekin aropiyon ne uskaa mobile chin liya
 'the accused tried to crush him,' he said, 'after being thrown from the bus they tried to crush us with the bus but in time i pulled my friend before getting under the bus
 ham bina kapadon ke the
 We tried to stop people passing by there
 kareeb 25 minute tak kai auto, car or bike vaale vahaan se apane vaahan kii gati dhimi karte or hamen dekhte hue gujarey lekin koi bhi vahaan nahin rukaa
 Then someone out on patrol stopped there and informed the police

 Finally we put our friend in a PCR van
 vahaan khadey logon main se kisi ne unki madad nahin kii
 It is possible that people are thinking that there will be blood in their hands
 dost ko vine main chadhaane main police ne madad nahin kii kyonki unke sharir se atyadhik raktasrav ho rahaa tha
 It took the PCR van more than two hours to travel from the spot to Safdarjung Hospital
 log bane rahe tamashbindivangat ladki ke dost ne bataaya ki police ke saath-saath kisi ne bhi hamen kapade nahin die or na hi ambulance bulaai
 He said, 'the people standing there were only watching us
 ’ unhone bataaya ki sharir dhakne ke liye kai baar anurodh karne par kisi ne bed shit kaa ek tukdaa diya
 He told, 'none of the people standing there helped us
 log shaayad is baat se bhaybheet the ki yadi ve hamaari madad karte hai to ve is ghatana ke gavaah ban jaaenge or baad main unhen police or adaalat ke chakkar kaatane padenge
 'nobody even gave clothes,' he said, 'even in the hospital we had to wait and i used to ask people to put clothes on the body

 He said, 'I had a head injury
 main is haalat main nahin tha ki chal-phir sakuun
 Even for two weeks i was not able to move my hand
 ’unhone kaha, ‘meraa parivaar mujhe apane paitruk ghar le janaa chahta tha lekin maine dilli main rukne kaa faisla kiya taaki main police kii madad kar sakuun
 On the advice of doctors, i went to my house and started treatment there
 ’unhone kaha, ‘jab main aspataal main apni dost se mila tha to vah muskura rahi thim
 She could write and was hopeful about things
 mujhe aisa kabhi nahin laga ki vah jeena nahin chaahati
 "he told," The victim told me that if i had not been there, she would not have been able to lodge a police complaint either
 maine faisla kiya tha ki aparaadhiyon ko unke kiye kii sajaa dilaaungaa
 The victim's friend said that her friend was worried about the cost of treatment
 unhone kaha, ‘meri dost kaa hausala badaye rakhane ke liye mujhe unke paas rahane ke liye kaha gaya
 'no animal even shows such cruelty,' he said, 'when my friend gave a statement to the woman SDM for the first time, i came to know about what happened to them
 un aropiyon ne meri dost ke saath jo kuch kiya, us par main vishwaas nahin kar sakaa
 Even animals, when they hunt, do not treat their prey with such cruelty
 ’divangat ladki ke dost ne kaha, ‘meri dost ne yah sab kuch saha or unhone magistrate se kaha ki aropiyon ko faansee nahin honi chahie balki unhen jalaakar maaraa janaa chahie
 'the first statement of the victim was right,' he said, 'the first statement my friend made to SDM was correct
 meri dost ne kaaphi prayaas ke baad apana bayaan diya tha
 She was coughing while giving a statement and her body was bleeding
 bayaan dene ko lekar na to kisi tarah kaa dabaav tha or na hi hastkshep, lekin esadm ne jab kaha ki bayaan darj karte samay un par dabaav tha to mujhe laga ki sabhi prayaas vyarth ho gaye
 The woman sdm's statement that the statements were recorded under pressure is false
 ’police ko jald uthaane chahie jaruri kadamyah puche jane par ki is tarah kii ghatana dobaaraa se na ho, yah sunishchit karne ke liye vah kya suzav dena chahenge
 To this, he said, 'police should always try to get the victim to the hospital as soon as possible
 peedit ko bhartee karaane ke liye police ko sarkari aspataal nahin dhudhana chahie
 Also the witnesses should not be disturbed
 ’mombatiyaan jalaane se nahin badalegi maansiktounhone kaha ki koi mombatiyaan jalaakar kisi kii maansikta ko nahin badal saktaa

 i am spending my treatment myself
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘meri dost kaa ilaaj yadi achche aspataal main shuru kiya gaya hota to shaayad aaj vah jinda hoti

 ’abhi ladani he lambii ladyeepeedita ke dost ne kaha, ‘hamen lambi ladaai ladani he
 If i did not have a lawyer in my family, i would not have been able to continue my fight in this matter
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘main chaar dinon tak police stesan main rahaa, jabaki mujhe isaki jagah aspataal main hona chahie tha
 i told my friends that i had fallen victim to an accident
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘maamle main dilli police ko swayan akalan karnaa chahie ki usne acha kaam kiya he athwa nahin
 He said, 'if you can help someone, then help him
 us raat kisi ek vyakti ne yadi meri madad kii hoti to aapke saamne kuch or tasviir hoti
 There is no need to close the metro station and stop people from saying what they say

 'he told,' i never thought of running away from my friend on the night of the accident
 aisi ghadi main yahaan tak ki jaanavar bhi apane saathi ko chhodkar nahin bhaangenge

 raksha mantri e
 K
 antni ke haal ke bayanon se jaahir he ki wif-sweaping ke ye aarope pehle hi sabit ho chuke hai or yahi vajah he ki unhone doshiyon ko kadi sajaa dene ke liye kadam uthaane kii baat kahi he
 Even before these statements, the discussion started in the media-watching circles that such things keep happening in the Navy
 sena par kendrit or usase jude duusare maamalon kii tarah is baar bhi ham main se zyaadaatar logon ne jaanch prakriya ke puraa hone se pehle hi jaldbaaji main apane-apane nishkarsh nikaal liye hai
 But this whole incident makes a story far more interesting and that story is the dismissal of a naval officer
 use ‘‘apane saathi afasar kii patni kaa sneh paatr ban baithne’’ ke aarope ke chalate barkhaast kiya gaya tha
 This half-baked sentence ridiculously prepared is actually a punishable offense in the army
 is gutthi ke bare main mere nishkarsh sainya balon ke bare main teen staron par bani samajhadaari par aadhaarit hai
 The wife of a military officer inside me is deeply shocked, the advocate of gender equality inside is thirsty for the blood of the accused, while my academic soul is watching the "army-drama" on TV and in newspapers
 Has been mukhyadhara ke media ne jo siyaasi vimarsh shuru kiya he, usamen aatankwaad ko bahut bade tamzam ke saath pesh kiya gaya he
 The same thing is seen in military affairs
 bhartiya sena saamaajik daayaron main apane santulit or shor-sharabe se dur rahane vaale swabhaav ke chalate jaani jaati he
 Until long after independence, there was no official system to communicate the activities of the army and information related to it to a large section of the society
 british adhikari rankon or medal ke alaava akad or hikaarat kii viraasat chhodkar bharat se vidaa hue the
 The same barbs were later linked to national security
 inhen vajahon se sena ke bare main jaagrukta kii kami, atakalbaajiyon or galat dharanaon kaa daur shuru hua
 The situation worsened over time as the army also did not show interest in making a direct contact with the common people
 nabbe ke dashak main saarvajanik soochna ke kshetra main buniyadi taur par badlaav hue, lekin sainya tantra usee puraane dharre par chalata rahaa
 For the first time during the Kargil War of 1999, the Indian military system, especially the Army, prepared a small group to work with the media
 army ne ek simit str par hi sahi par pehali baar us ladaai ke bare main us aam janata ke saath samvaad sthapit karne kii jarurat mahasoos kii, jisaki bina par vah ladaai lard rahi thi
 At that time, the entire country was drowning in the winds of patriotism
 yuddh ke sidhe prasaranon, shahid sainikon or shok main duube unke parijanon kii tasveeron ne vahi drishy paidaa kiya, jise dilli vishvavidhyalay ke professor suvarna chatarji ne ‘‘theatre of shradhanjali’’ kaa naam diya tha
 Recently a similar coverage of the incident involving two Indian soldiers being beheaded by Pakistani soldiers within the Indian border area in Kashmir was also done
 media dwaara sena kii in chhit-put gatividhiyon ko bad-chadhakar bataane kaa asar khatarnaak he
 This creates an atmosphere of rust
 ho saktaa he ki is maamle kii kai paraten hon, jinka sach vakt bitne ke saath saamne aa paae
 If the accusations of the Navy officer's wife are proved true, then surely her husband and possibly the senior officers involved will be accused of sexual abuse 
 is baat kii bhi sambhaavna he ki yah maamla shaadi se jude kisi kadave anubhav kaa nateeja ho
 In both cases, the Navy will remain in some kind of background
 abhi yah samajha janaa baaki he ki agar yah maamla wif-sweaping kaa bhi he, (jo ki patni dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon se mail nahin khaataa) to bhi iske liye sena main koi niyam nahin he
 The Army is indeed very conservative and this is in sharp contrast to the image of the Army which has been made in our mind by films and TV serials made without any research and preparation
 sena main jarurat se zyada ghulne-milane ko badhaava nahin diya jaataa he
 This case has highlighted the mistakes that the mainstream media makes during coverage of news related to the military
 uske nishane par maamle se jude hue logon kii bajaae puri sanstha hoti he
 He draws conclusions based on half-baked things and uses sensational terminology
 beete dinon bhrashtachar or hinsa ke maamalon main sena ke adhikariyon ke naam saamne aae hai or har maamle main media ne yahi galati kii he
 These mistakes are leading to superficial debates about the army and conclusions are being drawn

 Chirag Paswan, the son of LJP MP and head Ram Vilas Paswan, is among the fastest emerging politicians on the political scene in Bihar
 bahut kam samay menchirag paswan ne raajnneetik galiyare mempani jagah banaai he
 As a young leader, as an organizer and on the strength of his ability to make fast decisions by seizing the opportunity
 bihar main siyaasi rup se teji se apana kad badha rahechirag paswan ke safar par aaie daalate hai ek najar:1
 Chirag Paswan's biggest identity is his being the son of Lok Janshakti Party i
e
 LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan
 lekin keval itane bhar se chiraag paswan ke siyasat ko aanka nahin ja saktaa
 Today Chirag Paswan is one of the influential figures in the politics of Bihar and shows a lot of activism not only in the party's Balkindia coalition
 2
 Chirag Paswan has entered politics from the glamorous world of cinema
 31 oktober 1982 ko unka janm hua tha
 Chirag Paswan, who studies computer science, is also a fashion designer
 lekin unhone film main abhiyan kii duniya main bhi haath aajamaaya
 3
 chiraag paswan ne pehle film kii duniya main apni kismat aajamaai
 Chirag Paswan made his film debut with the 2011 film Mile Na Mile Hum
 is film ke liye chiraag kaa namakan 'kal ke super star' category main stardst award ke liye hua
 The film could not go on and Chirag Paswan's film career also ended with this film
 4
 When the film career flopped, then Paswan switched to politics
 yahaan chiraag ko zyada mushkilen nahin ain
 Father Ram Vilas Paswan is a frozen politician and Chirag Paswan was easily found by the launching pad
 aaj chiraag paswan bihar ke jamui lok sabha nirvachan kshetra se saansad hai or algepi ke sansadeey cameti ke pramukh hai
 5
 haalanki, jab chiraag ne raajnneeti main kadam rakhaa to ramvilas paswan ke liye mushkil daur tha
 The party's account was not even opened in the Lok Sabha elections, and Ram Vilas Paswan himself was able to make a plan to reach the Rajya Sabha
 rajya vidhansabha main party kii sadsy sankhya koi prabhaav chhodane laayak nahin thi
 6
 chiraag paswan ne is mushkil ghadi main raajnneeti kaa daaman thama or party ke liye nae sire se sambhaavnaaen talashne kaa kaam shuru kiya
 The LJP was seen in the UPA camp becoming increasingly unpopular and in the name of secularism, Ram Vilas Paswan found it difficult to enter the BJP camp
 khaskar jab bhaajapa narendra modi ke netritv main aage badhane kaa faisla kar chuki thi
 From here Chirag Paswan decided to change both the political attitude and political fortunes of the party
 7
 When Nitish Kumar split from BJP against Narendra Modi, the BJP was looking for a new partner in Bihar
 2014 ke aam chunaavon ke liye aise vakt main algepi bhaajapa ke saath khadi hui
 It was believed that Chirag Paswan's strategy was fully working behind this decision of Ram Vilas Paswan and LJP
 8
 Chirag Paswan's decision changed everything
 bhaajapa ko pichley saal hue chunaavon main spasht bahumat mila
 Lok Janshakti Party elected 6 mps and reached the Lok Sabha
 khud chiraag paswan ne jamui main argedy ke sudhanshu shekhar bhaskar ko 85 hajaar voton se haraakar loksabhaa kii sadsyta hasil kii or 32 saal kii umr main saansad ke rup main nai pari shuru kii
 9
 siyasat or ranneeti main aae is badlaav neelgepi ko centre kii sarkaar main sahyogi banaaya
 Today Ram Vilas Paswan is the Minister of Consumer, Food and Public Distribution in the Narendra Modi government
 10
 The LJP is contesting 40 seats out of 243 in the 2015 Bihar assembly elections
 endie main bijepi ke alaava algepi, HAM or ralospa shaamil he
 Be it the issue of seat-sharing in the NDA or the party's decision on ticket distribution, Chirag Paswan has been prominently visible and this shows his growing stature in politics
 rashtriya rajdhani dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main der raat sharaab pikar mahilaon ke hangaame se nijaat paane ke liye pub maalikon ne nai tarkeeb nikaali he

 bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee guuruuvaar ko chunaav main maare gaye tiemasi kaaryakartaaon ke parijanon se milin
 Mamta went to the house of Nirmal Kundu who was shot dead in Nimta in 24 Parganas district on Tuesday
 tiemasi ne is hatya kaa aarope bijepi netaaon par lagaaya he
 Two accused related to this case have been arrested by the police
 mamata banerjee ne kaha ki bijepi ne dhokhe se 18 siten jeet leen
 Mamta Banerjee said, 'we want justice
 doshiyon ko bakhsha nahin ja saktaa
 My DG is here
 jo log sajeeshkarta hai unki chaanbin honi chahie
 He (BJP) cheated and won 18 seats but he cannot kill people nor spread violence
 ' mamata banerjee ne kaha, '1984 main indira gandhi kii jab maut hui, tab hinsa bhadak gai thi lekin bijepi hinsa failaa rahi he
 Violence has increased where BJP has won
 'bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne kaha, 'bengal shanti kaa sthal he na ki hinsa kaa
 This is where the national anthem started
 isi jagah se vande maataram kii shuruyaat hui
 He (BJP) broke the statue of Vidyasagar

 Earlier, Mamata Banerjee accused BJP of misusing power, money power and power to win Lok Sabha elections and called for ballot (ballot) elections by implementing pre-evm system to save democracy
 rajya sachivalay main party ke padaadhikariyon, saansadon or vidhayakon ke saath baithak karne ke baad unhone kaha, "samooche chunaav ke dauraan ham baahubal, dhanabal, sattabal or saansthanik bal ke durupyog ke khilaaf lade
 Our workers fought fearlessly
 ham charchaa kar rahe hai ki kis tarah dhan lutaa gaya or dhanabal ne kis tarah loktantr ko barbaad kiya, yah sachai he
 "mamata said," They (BJP) got 18 seats (in Bengal) from Dhanbal, Bahubal, Shaktabal, Communalism Force and Media Force
 unka lakshya 23 siten paanaa tha
 Perhaps evms were pre-programmed in his interest

 Before this, why did the All India level West Uttar Pradesh Movement of Chaudhary Charan Singh Memorial not be covered or covered by the media
 choudhary charan singh chah maheene tak pradhanmantri rahe or kabhi sansad kaa saamana nahin kar sake
 He has been one of the leading heroes of anti-congress politics

 If you read Ambedkar's statement then you will get confused because it is not so easy to understand
 'bharat ke raajnneetik jivan main nayak or nayak puja ek kadavi sachai he

 Wherever the statue of Kamaraj was installed, Annadurai was also installed there
 shrivatsan ne likhaa he ki nehru ke nidhan ke baad memorial banane ke liye ek trust bana
 Whose secretary Karan Singh said that for two years only one crore was accumulated, while the target was 20 crore
 tab jab nehru kaaphi lokapriy bataaye jate the
 Perhaps this is why political parties have carried out the politics of building a memorial on the basis of government money and resources

 yah 1997 kii baat he, odisha ke purv mukhyamantri biju patnayak kaa achaanak heart atake kii vajah se dehanth ho gaya
 Biju Patnaik was a popular leader of the Janata Dal
 biju patnayak kii maut ke baad party ko koun aage le jayega, ise lekar kai sawaal khadey kiye ja rahe the
 Biju Patnaik's son Naveen Patnaik was not much interested in politics
 naveen patnayak kii padhai odisha ke baahar hui
 He also had difficulties speaking the Odisha language
 aise main party koun sanbhaalega yah bahut badi sawaal tha
 Suddenly Naveen Patnaik was persuaded to enter politics and Naveen agreed to start his career in politics

 Bajpayee and Biju Patnaik had a good relationship
 donon jepi andolan ke samay se ek-duusare ko acchhee tarah se jaanate the
 If there is a hung assembly in Odisha, the Biju Janata Dal does not get an absolute majority, what will happen then? In such a situation, it may also happen that Congress should support Biju Janata Dal from outside to keep BJP away from power
 aise main congress yah nahin chaahegi ki biju janata dal endie ko samarthan de
 Secondly, Naveen's relationship with BJP leaders like Jai Panda and Vijay Mahapatra has deteriorated
 jab tak yah donon netaa bijepi main rahenge naveen ko samajhane main thodi dikkat hogi
 This time Panda has openly attacked Naveen
 bijedy ke kai netaa is baar chunaav se pehle bijepi main chal gaye the
 Naveen is not happy with this but will also have to keep in mind that Naveen can do anything for his own benefit

 In front of this park is the hideout of 75-year-old Satya Narayan Shukla, a white old-fashioned Kothi, who has set a bar against political corruption
 nate kad ke shukla hi vah shaks hai, jinaki lambii adalati jang ne haal hi main uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantriyon ko sarkaar bangala khaali karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 Shukla, who is the architect of the ouster of former chief ministers from government bungalows, is beating his growing age
 bhartiya prashasnic seva se ritair hone ke baad ve apane ghar ke kone main sthit chote-se kamare main kitabon or filon ke bich laptop lekar rajnatik bhrashtachar ke khilaaf apni ladaai ko dhar dene main jute hue hai
 Born in February 1943, the house of Pandit Rameshwar Dayal Shukla, living in Jalaun district of Bundelkhand, Satya Narayan Shukla was brilliant from the beginning

 In the first attempt in the year 1966, he took the country's prestigious competitive examination 'indian Civil Service'
 haalanki kam rank hone kii vajah se unka chayan iskar seva main hua
 He took the exam again and the following year he was selected in the Indian Administrative Service
 unhen gujarat cader mila or shuruaati tainaati baroda jile main up-jiladhikari (esadm) ke pad par hui
 In 1977, Shukla was transferred from Gujarat to UP cadre
 iske baad ve apper nideshak (udyog), nideshak laghu udyog, nideshak hathkargha, shram ayukl, sachiv lok nirmaan or rajya sampatti vibhaag, sachiv sansthagat vitt jaise mahatvapurn padon par rahe
 The first episode of allotment of bungalows to former Chief Ministers came in the year 1985 when Narayan Dutt Tiwari was the Chief Minister
 us vakt sachiv, lok nirmaan or rajya sampatti vibhaag ke pad par tainaat shukla se narayan dutt tiwari ne purv mukhyamantri vishwanath pratap singh ko lakhanu ke mal avenu main ek bangala aavantit karne kaa aadesh diya
 Shukla explains, "since the mall Avenue had a Category Six bungalow that could only be given to working ministers
 isliye maine purv mukhyamantri ke rup main vishwanath pratap singh ko bangala aavantit karne main asamarthta jataai
 With more emphasis, he was allotted a bungalow of category five at Raj Bhavan
 ”in 1989, Narayan Dutt Tiwari was allotted a bungalow of category six in Mall Avenue as a former chief minister and this tradition started from here
 uttar pradesh vidhansabha ke ritred sachiv devaki nandan mittal ne varsh 1996 main apni sanstha 'janhit sanghathan' kii taraf se trust or purv mukhyamantriyon ko bangala aavantit kiye jane ke khilaaf hycourt main ek yachika daakhil kii
 Mittal argued that there is no rule for allotting bungalows to trusts and former chief ministers, on the basis that they should be immediately repealed
 bangala aavanton ko auchitypurna tehraane ke liye rajya sarkaar ne cabinet ke aadesh se 'bhootpurv mukhyamantri awaas aavanton niyamavali-1997' lagu kar ise court main pesh kar diya
 The High Court dismissed Mittal's petition in 2001 without announcing any decision on the validity of the rules
 do saal baad farvari, 2003 main adhyaksh, rajya satarkta ayog ke pad par tainaat shukla sevanivritti ho gaye
 The next month, he got himself registered as a lawyer in the Lucknow bench of the High Court

 C
 dvivedi ne purv mukhyamantriyon ko milane vaale bangalon ke sambandh main devaki nandan mittal kii yachika kii jaankaree di
 After studying the order of the High Court, it was found that the court has not taken any decision on the validity of the relevant rules
 iske baad varsh 2004 main lok prahari kii taraf se pehali yachika supreme court main purv mukhyamantriyon ko bangala aavantit kiye jane ke virodh main daayar kii gai
 Accepting the petition, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the state government
 kareeb das saal baad 2014 main yachika par sunwaayee shuru hui
 In August 2016, the Supreme Court struck down the 'former Chief Minister Housing Allotment Rules-1997' for being against the law and order and ordered the former Chief Ministers to vacate the bungalow within two months
 iske baad tatkaaleen sapa sarkaar ne 'uttar pradesh mantri (vetan, bhatta or prakeern upbandh) sanshodhan adhinium-2016' ke jariye purv mukhyamantriyon ko aaajeevan sarkari bangala die jane ko kanoonee jama pehanaane kii vyavastha kii
 Shukla says, "we challenged the amendment of the rules in the Supreme Court
 hamaara tark tha ki jab sabhi sarkari karmchaariyon-adhikariyon ko seva samaapt ke baad sarkari ghar khaali karnaa padataa he, aise main purv mukhyamantriyon ko aaajeevan bangala diya janaa na sirf kanuunan galat he balki bhartiya samvidhan ke mul adhikaron kaa hanan he
 Agreeing with the arguments of the Lok Sabha, the Court repealed the 'uttar Pradesh Ministerial (salary, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Amendment Act-2016' and the former Chief Ministers had to vacate their official bungalow

 a blue board with 'sri Kanshi Ram memorial resting place' was put up on the morning of May 21, outside the luxurious 13-A number bungalow located just opposite the bsp's state office in Mall Avenue area in Lucknow
 yah vahi bangala tha jahaan rahakar mayawati upi kii raajnneeti main dobaaraa apni dhamak dikhaane kii taiyaari kar rahi thim
 After this, the BSP national president started his ban by sending his lieutenant and party's national general secretary Satish Mishra to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to establish the 13-A Mall Avenue bungalow as a 'kanshi Ram memorial resting place'
 bangala khaali karne kii 15 din kii tay miyaad ke antim din mayawati ne 9 mal avenu ke pate vaale apane nijee awaas main jane se pehle aam janata ke bich hameshaa se jigyaasa kaa centre rahe 13-e mal avenu ke bangale ke ek-ek kone ko media ko dikhaaya
 Mayawati, for the first time, showed the media the 'murals' of Kanshiram, the founder of the BSP in the bungalow, as a guide
 mayawati ne vah 'mural' khaas taur par dikhaaya jisamen bahujan samaaj ke saat mahapurushon ke saath kanshiram or ve khud najar aa rahi hai
 By showing Kanshiram's funeral and the ashes of the urn, Mayawati tried to prove that the bungalow at 13-A Mall Avenue was in fact a 'kanshi Ram memorial resting place' and she has lived in one corner of it till now

 Manish Hindavi, associate professor at Lucknow University, says, "the BJP government, which was trying to save the Dalit votes before the Lok Sabha elections, remained soft in front of Mayawati's master stroke, while Mayawati took an aggressive stance on the issue of evacuating her bungalow
 Was able to deliver the message to ''ab rajya sampatti vibhaag 13-e mal avenu vaale bangale ko do bhaagon main baantne kii taiyaari kar rahaa he
 One part will be developed as a 'kanshi Ram memorial resting place' and the other part will be used as a residential bungalow

 On 8 June, the State Property Department officials called the media and witnessed the vandalism of the bungalow the next day after the SP chief Akhilesh Yadav got the key to the bungalow at 4 Vikramaditya Marg on June 8
 adhikariyon ne paroksh rup se yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki kaise sapa adhyaksh ne sarkari sampatti ko kshati pahunchaai he? akhilesh yadav kehete hai, ''bhaajapa mujhe badnaam kar rahi he
 The government should hand over the list of damage done to the bungalow to me, we will make up for it
 ''vahiin supreme court ke aadesh ke baad paanch purv mukhyamantriyon—mulaayam singh yadav, mayawati, kalyaan singh, rajnath singh or akhilesh yadav—ke khaali ho chuke bangalon ko lekar ab bhaajapa sarkaar ke mantriyon ke bich rassakashi shuru ho chuki he

 Sri Krishna, considered the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu, has immense glory not only in India but in the whole world
 unhen maanane waalon kii sankhya kai karod he
 This is the reason why many temples of Kanha of Yashoda are established not only within the country, but also abroad
 unke jivan se jude naa keval kuch udhaaharan, varan unase jude mantra bhi bhakton ke liye behad sahaayak hai
 Therefore today we are going to tell you some such mantras related to Shri Krishna who give wealth and beauty in life
 yah mantra kaaphi saral hai, lekin phir bhi dhyaan rahe ki aap inkaa sahi uccharan hi karen
 According to Hindu beliefs, the rightly chanted mantras give the right fruit, and the wrong pronunciation of mantras can sometimes cause havoc, as it gives the opposite fruit rather than its right

 is mantra ke jaap se samast aarthik manokamanaayen purna hoti hai
 If you are going through a financial crisis then after morning bath, chant this mantra at least one lakh times
 aapako jald hi sudhaar dekhne ko milegaa
 
 
 "krishna Krishna, Mahakrishna Sarvajna, in the world
" ramaraman vidyesh vidyamashu prayachh main”
 
 
 This mantra with 33 letters has miraculous powers that you will not be able to believe
 is shrikrishna mantra kaa jo bhi sadhak jaap karata he use samast prakaar kii vidyaayein nihsandeh praapt hoti hai
 This mantra is considered confidential, one should not know while doing it
 
 krishnakarshati aakarshati sarvan jeevan iti krishnah
 
 om vedah vetan purushah mahantaan devanujan pratirant jeev se 
 shrikrishna ke is mantra main taintis (33) akshar hai, jiske niyamit jaap se dhan se sambandhit kisi bhi prakaar kaa sankat tal jaataa hasabhi mantra amuman dhan prapti se hi jude hai, lekin kuch mantra aise bhi hai jo aapako kai siddhiyon kii praati kara sakate hai
 But repeat again, learn the correct pronunciation of these mantras first and then chant
 anyathaa galat uccharan aapako sankat main daal saktaa he
 Replying to the letter received by the Prime Minister's Office, Anna Hazare said, 'in the letter of PMO, i have been described as a traitor
 unhone bataaya ki piem kii chitthee ab mili he isliye uskaa jawaab ab de rahaa hum
 Questioning the letter, Anna said, 'if i am a traitor, the government is yours, why don't you take action? If i am a traitor, why am i not put in jail? Anna further said that it is written in the letter that foreign power is behind Team Anna
 unhone kaha ki hamaare peeche agar koi videshi shakti he to sarkaar uskaa naam bataae
 He alleged that such false allegations are being made and conspiracy is being done on Team Anna to divert attention from Lokpal
 anna ne kaha ki PMO hamaare upar galat aarope laga rahaa he
 He questioned that when action is being taken against corruption, what is the reason that corruption is increasing day by day? Anna said that the government's intention on corruption is not clear
 hajaare ne ahmednagar jila sthit apane gaanv ralegansiddhi main yojit ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha, ‘sarkaar bhrashtachar par roak lagane ke liye majboot lokapal ko lekar asamanjas kii sthiti main he
 His motives are not honest
 ’unhone kaha, ‘pradhanmantri karyaalay kaa kahana he ki lokapal vidheyak kaa masauda hamase, hamaare sahyogiyon se salaah mashvire ke baad taiyaar kiya ja chukaa he
 They are misleading people
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘gat varsh hamaara masauda taiyaar tha, sarkaar kaa masauda taiyaar tha
 They could put both drafts before the cabinet
 samay nasht kyon kiya gaya? yah spasht he ki unamem majboot bhrashtachar virdohi vidheyak banane ko lekar ichhashakti kii kami he or ve logon ko gumraah kar rahe hai
 Hazare said that 65 years after independence, we are still following the laws made by the British
 unhone kaha, ‘aadhikarik gopneey kanoon kii kya aavashyaktaa he?’ unhone kaha, ‘sarkaar kah rahi he, pradhanmantri karyaalay kah rahaa he ki bhrashtachar mitaane ke liye kai kadam uthaaye gaye hai
 When a law is made in a democracy, people should be taken into confidence
 yahaan par sarkaar masauda bana rahi he or kanoon bhi bana rahi he
 'the reason why Hazare has no restriction on corruption is that there are many flaws in the government's law
 hajaare ne is aarope se inkaar kiya ki unke andolan ne kharch kaa lekhajokha nahin diya tha
 He said, 'we have audited our account and put it on the internet
 aapaki party bhi kai tarah kii rashiyaan ekatrit karti he, aap khaaton kaa lekhajokha logon ko uplabdh kyon nahin kara rahe hai
 ' beete farvari maheene main antarim bajet ke liye aavantit rakam ko vitt mantralay jari rakhane kii yojana main he
 In fact, a circular issued by the Finance Ministry stated that it would make additional allocation only for the necessary funds for which the allocation was not made in the interim budget
 mantralay ne kaha, ‘antarim bajet 2019-20 main kiye gaye aavantnon main koi badlaav nahin kiya jayega
 'the budget will be presented on July 5, in view of the Lok Sabha elections, the Finance Ministry presented the interim budget in February

 Apart from this, the official team will be headed by Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, Expenditure Secretary Girish Chandra Murmu, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, Deepam Secretary Atanu Chakraborty and Financial Affairs Secretary Rajeev Kumar
 bajet kii taiyaari shurubajet ko lekar taiyaariyaan shuru ho chuki hai or vitt mantralay main 'quarantine' lagu ho chukaa he
 Under this, officers and employees engaged in budget making are banned from contact with outsiders
 yah pabandi 5 july ko bajet pesh hone tak lagu rahegi
 Visitors and media will not be allowed to visit the Ministry of Finance during this period
 vahiin puri bajet prakriya ko gopneey rakhane ke liye north block main kadi suraksha vyavastha hogi
 Electronic devices will be installed for monitoring and in most of the computers in the ministry e-mail service will be blocked
 sitaraman ke saamne kya he chalendapane pehle bajet main vitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ke saamne kai chunautiyaan hai
 For example, slowdown in the economy, financial sector crises such as rising debt and cash crunch in non-banking financial companies (nbfcs) can add to the difficulties
 iske alaava rojgaar srijan, nijee nivesh, niryaat main sudhaar, krishi kshetra ke sankat or saarvajanik nivesh badhaane ke upayon par dhyaan dena hoga

 This is the property of Almighty
 ham to iske rakshak yani castodian hai
 We are not seeking ownership

 The board had issued a notice to the ASI seeking its reply and the ASI, in its reply, opposed it and said that the Taj Mahal is their property
 lekin board ne ASI kii daleelon ko darkinar karte hue tajmahal ko board kii sampatti ghoshit kar di thi

 in) on Dec 12, 2017 at 10:23 pm PST nai dilli: mahatma gandhi gurudev rabindranath tagore kii tarah srujanaatmak lekhak nahin the, lekin unka lekhan vibhinn bhashaaon main, jinamein gujarati, angrezi or hindi shaamil he main alag-alag tareekon se vyakt hota tha
 While Gandhi is seen communicating with the Indian public in Gujarati, his writing in English appears to be communicating with the British government
 ye vichaar sahitya academy ne apane sthapana diwas par 'mahatma gandhi: ek lekhak or vaktaa ke rup main' vishyak vyaakhyaan ke dauraan itihaaskaar, lekhak ramchandra guha ne vyakt kiye
 In support of his point, Guha gave his argument in a logical manner, citing three examples of Mahatma Gandhi's writings
 gandhi kaa ek lekh prakritik aapadaa se sambandhit tha, jo san 1934 ke bihar-bukamp ke varnan par tha, to doosraa manavnirmit aapadaa ke bare main tha jo 1921 main ahyog andolan ke dauraan prince wales ke bombay aagaman ke virodh ko lekar tha
 Similarly, the third and final example was associated with the tribute of Sir Andrews in 1940
 jaahir he in teenon hi ghatnaon main gandhi kii bhashaa ghatnaon ke anusaar parivartit hui he
 Gandhi cites the loss of life and property in the earthquake incident, and condemns the attacks on Parsis and Christians by hindu-muslims in the Bombay incident
 lui fisher kii pustak ke ek udhaaharan se guha ne yah bhi sthapit kiya ki gandhi ek vaktaa ke rup main bahut sanyat rahete the, aakraamak nahin the
 Gandhi's specialty was that while speaking, he used to speak very smoothly
 unhone hind swaraj ke ek udhaaharan ke aadhaar par bataaya ki mahatma gandhi kaa puraa lekhan chaar mukhya vichaaron- saamaajik parivartan, aarthik unnati, saanskrithik ekta or ahimsa par kendrit he
 He explained by examples of Indian Opinion, Young India, Harijan edited by Gandhi that through these we can very easily target various changes in his writing
 itihaaskaar ramchandra guha kaa tark tha ki gandhi ke vipul lekhan kaa mahatva tab or bad jaataa he, jab ham dekhte hai ki unka yah lekhan kisi tay sthaan par baithkar nahin hua he, balki tamaam yatraaon or sthanon par anek kaam karne ke bich unhone aisa sambhav kar dikhaaya he
 He said that K

 At the beginning of the program, former secretary of Sahitya Akademi, Indranath Chaudhuri welcomed Ramachandra Guha by presenting books and Angavastram
 sahitya academy ke sachiv ke
 Srinivasa Rao duly introduced Ramachandra Guha to the audience, describing the journey of the Sahitya Academy so far
