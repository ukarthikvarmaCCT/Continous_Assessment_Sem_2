 com / wyuj5zfiw1— Cricket South Africa (@officialcsa)march 27, 2015dekhen abi divilliars kaa videoh RJD supremo Lalu Yadav of Nitish Kumar's resignation as Chief Minister in Bihar has raised serious questions on Nitish
 unhone kaha ki centre main bijepi sarkaar ke gathan ke baad nitish kumaar ne nayaa vikalp dene kii baat kii thi
 At that time, he had said to make a grand alliance, saying that to create a union-free India
 unhone kaha ki istife se pehle nitish se hamaari baat hui thi ki baithkar galatfahami dur kii ja sakati hai
 Nitish had never asked for Tejashwi's resignation, but he had definitely spoken about putting his side in public
 LIVE: nitish kumaar ne diya istipha, lalu bole- hatyaropee hai nitish, koi teesraa bane cmlalu yadav ne kaha ki tejasvi ke istife ko lekar kaaphi galat fahmiyaan thi isliye hamanen safai nahin di or pehle hi benami sampatti ke maamle main ham safai de chuke the
 It was decided to give cleanliness to the investigating agency, there was no need to give any explanation
 vidhanmandal bhi tejasvi ke saath tha
 Lalu attacked Nitish saying that the resignation was completely set
 nitish par bhi 302 kaa mukadmaa darj he or unke khilaaf sangyaan liya ja chukaa he
 There is no Chief Minister of the country who has a murder case registered
 un par jo mukadmaa darj he usamen faansee kii sajaa he
 RJD Chief Lalu Yadav said that we were aware of the lawsuit lodged against Nitish
 mere paas is cese se sabhi dastavej maujuud he
 This statement is not mine but his affidavit mentions the matter, so how did he sit on the post of CM
 eemaandaaree or bhrashtachar se bada he atyaachaar or nitish kumaar usee hatya ke aaropee hai
 This is the zero tolerance policy, my younger brother Nitish Kumarki
 unako yah maaloom tha ki ab is maamle main ham bachane vaale nahin he isliye unhone tejasvi se istipha na mangakar khud istipha de diya
 Taking a dig at Prime Minister Modi, Lalu said that Nitish has met BJP and after his resignation, Prime Minister Modi tweeted and congratulated him
 istife dene jane se pehle hamane unase manaa bhi kiya lekin vah nahin maane, hamen unke istipha kaa dukh he
 Lalu said that i appeal to Nitish that if he has the intention to fight against the communal forces, then choose another leader other than RJD-JDU and Congress MLA Nitish
 lalu yadav ne kaha ki unhen nitish ke manshaa par shaq he
 Because from demonetization to presidential elections, he has been supporting BJP
 hamaari maang he ki sabhi dalon ko vidhayakon ko baithkar bihar main nayaa netaa chunaa jaae
 He said that we also do not want President's rule in Bihar, apart from tejashwi-nitish, new leadership should be chosen to run the government and respect the mandate

 The Reserve Bank may postpone the cuts due to these five domestic reasons
 According to some experts, the RBI is unlikely to make any changes in policy rates in the August monetary policy review
 1
 RBI will wait for more inflation figures
 2
 The RBI will also wait to see if the full benefit of the earlier cuts reached consumers
 3
 Differences in wholesale and retail inflation figures made RBI work difficult
 4
 The decline in the May figures of industrial production is not visible in the manufacturing sector
 5
 Weak monsoon forecast in july-august will continue to worry RBI

 The Election Commission has decided to give Janata Dal United (JDU) election symbol 'arrow' to Nitish Kumar's faction
 sharad yadav or ali anwar ko party se nikaalane ke baad sharad yadav or ali anwar group ne chunaav ayog main jidiu kechunaav chinh tirake nishaan par apana daawa kiya tha

 aapako bataa den ki nitish kumaar khemaa or sharad yadav khemaa donon ne chunaav ayog main ek baar phir se arji daayar kii thi or tir nishaan ke upar apana daawa thoka tha
 On Monday, the leaders and lawyers of both the groups submitted their arguments before the Election Commission in the Election Commission office in Delhi, but the Election Commission had not taken any decision
 isse pehle bihar main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar girane or nitish kumaar ke waapas NDA main jane ke baad se hi sharad yadav ne party ke khilaaf baagi tevar apana liya tha or jediu par apana daawa thoka tha

 chunaav ayog ne us vakt nitish kumaar gut ko hi asli jediu ke rup main manyata barkaraar rakhi thi
 It is worth mentioning that after Sharad Yadav's rebel attitude, JDU met Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu and demanded the termination of Sharad Yadav's Rajya Sabha membership, on which the decision is yet to come

 com / 1rx5rxmbgn— ANI (@ani)june 19, 2019 In modern life, most of the youth have a craze for late night partying, hanging out with friends, enjoying the film
 vahiin, jin logon ko akele samay bitaana pasand hota he, unhen anti-soshal kaa tag de diya jaataa he
 But a recent study has revealed a shocking thing
 study kii report ke mutabik, agar aap der raat party karne ke bajaae apane ghar par rahakar koi acchhee kitaab padane ko zyada ahmiyat dete hai to ye aapke intellegent hone kii pahchaan he
 According to researchers from Singapore Management University and London School of Economics, intelligent people prefer to spend time with themselves rather than moving around
 is study main shodhakartaaon ne 18 se 28 varsh ke lagbhag 15,000 se adhik logon ko shaamil kiya
 In this, the researchers try to know how much populated places these people live and how much they move with their friends
 iske saath shodhakartaaon ne ye bhi pataa lagaaya ki kitne log apane jivan se santusht hai
 The results revealed that people who live in sparsely populated places are happier than others
 vahiin, inamen se kai logon ko sirf khaas logon se milane par hi khushi kaa ehsaas hua
 The researchers based their findings on 'the Savannah Theory of Happiness' for this study
 is theory ke mutabik, jivan main ek vyakti kii santushti sirf vartmaan main hone vaali ghatnaon par nirdhaarit nahin hoti he, balki is baat se bhi prabhavit hoti he ki hamaare purvaj aisi sthiti main kis tarah riect karte the
 According to this theory, our ancestors loved to spend time with other people and they gave special importance to spending time with someone in their life
 thik usee tarah maujuuda daur main bhi kai logon ko akele rahanaa pasand nahin hota he or aise log kisi naa kisi kii company paane kii talash main rahete hai
 But in contrast, psychologists believe that intelligent people do not believe in this
 balki aise log apni company main zyada khush rahete hai
 If you are not afraid of being alone in life and you are more happy in your own company, then you are intelligent

 Including MTNL, the number of employees applying for premature retirement for VRS has reached above 60 thousand
 BSNL ke karmchaariyon kii sankhya kareeb 1
 50 lakhs
 isamen se kareeb ek lakh karmchaaree viares ke daayre main aate hai
 The company expects around 77,000 employees to take advantage of the scheme
 iskaa matlab he ki agar itane karmchaaree viares kaa vikalp chunate hai, karmchaariyon kii sankhya aadhi ho jaaegi
 The effective date of VRS under the current plan is 31 January 2020
 is bare main sampark kiye jane par BSNL ke chairman or prabandh nideshak pi ke puravaar ne is baat kii pushti kii ki is maamle main charchaa shuru kii gayi he or nigam kaamkaaj ko jari rakhane tathaa uske punargathan kii yojana bana rahi he
 Purwar said, 'we have to work thoughtfully
 hamane aankade lenaa shuru kiya he
 
 
 As expected, employees opt for VRS, even after that we will have around 80,000 employees
 lekin yah kul sankhya kaa aadha hoga
 Work culture has to change
 ' doorsanchaar vibhaag ke sutara ne kaha ki kuch kaam ko outsorcing karne main bhi vakt lagegaa
 VRS will come into effect from January
 jaldi hi samaadhaan nikaalnaa hoga
 According to the formula, several options are being considered
 isamen se ek vikalp yah bhi he ki jo karmchaaree VRS le rahe hai, unamem se kuch kii kya bataur paramarshdaata seva lee ja sakati he
 Last week, bsnl's VRS scheme will be open till December 3
 BSNL ko ummid he ki 70,000 se 80,000 karmchaaree viares yojana ko apanaayenge or isse vetan mad main kareeb 7,000 karod rupee kii bachat hogi

 Senior lawyer Ram Jethmalani once again claimed that he met underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in London years ago
 jethmalani ke mutabik daaud ne unase kaha tha ki wo kuch sharton ke saath bharat lautnaa chahta he, lekin maharashtra ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri sharad pavaar ne un sharton ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Ram Jethmalani has said that Dawood had laid some conditions for returning to the country
 usne mujhase kaha tha "wo desh lautne ke liye taiyaar he, agar use aashwast kiya jaae ki poochtacha main uske khilaaf third degree kaa istemaal nahin hoga
 He will be kept under house arrest during the entire legal process
 mujhe yaad he is maamle main maine sharad pavaar ko khat likhaa tha
 " jethmalani ne kaha, 
 
 
 But apart from the then central government, Maharashtra government chief Sharad Pawar refused to accept Dawood's terms
 is maamle main sharad pavaar kaa kahana he ki prastaav aayaa tha ye sach he, lekin usne samarpan ke saath kuch sharten rakhi thim, hamane kah diya tha ki ye hamen manzur nahin he
 "comments udhar is maamle main centre sarkaar ne koi tippanee se inkaar kar diya
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, "we are doing what the Government of India has to do, we will not comment on others"
 vaise ye sach he ki desh main duusare muddon kii tarah daaud ko bhi bharat waapas laane ke mudde ko har siyaasi dal chunavi jumale kii tarah istemaal karata he
 Every party claims that after coming into the government, they will bring the country to the culprit, but every time there is nothing except speech
 ram jethmalani ne kaha he daaud ne desh lautne ke liye kuch sharten rakhi thim
 He told me "he is ready to return to the country if he is assured that a third degree will not be used against him in questioning
" sari kanoonee prakriya ke dauraan use ghar main nazarband rakhaa jayega
 i remember that i wrote a letter to Sharad Pawar in this matter
 " Jethmalani said,
 
 
 lekin tatkaaleen centre sarkaar ke alaava maharashtra sarkaar ke mukhiya sharad pavaar ne daaud kii sharton ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 In this case, Sharad Pawar says that the proposal came, it is true, but he had laid down some conditions with dedication, we had said that this is not acceptable to us
 " tippaniyan On the other hand, the central government refused to comment on the matter
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha, "bharat sarkaar ko jo karnaa he, ham kar rahe hai, ham dusron par tippanee nahin karenge"
 It is true that like any other issue in the country, every political party uses the issue of bringing Dawood back to India like an electoral jumble
 har dal daawa karata he ki sarkaar main aane ke baad wo desh ko mujrim ko desh lekar aayega, lekin har baar sivaay bhaashan ke hota kuch nahin he

 dilli sarkaar or guest teachers ke bich badhati tanatani kaa asar ab guest teachers ke ekstansion par padegaa
 The Kejriwal government has made it clear that the guest teachers currently teaching in government schools will not be given extensions next year
 agle saal july maah se chalane vaale seshan main nae sire se bhartiyon kii jaaengi
 Delhi: Online training to improve the skills of teachers, it has become clear after the decision that guest teachers will now be able to teach only till May 2017
 yahi nahin, aage se jo bhartiyon hongi, ab se ve 10 maah ke liye hi kii jaaengi
 Keeping strict in the recruitment, only those who have passed CTET will be able to apply from next year
 CBSE kaa aadesh, ab aise chune jaaenge nijee skulon ke principles
 
 
 It is worth noting that right now there are about two thousand guest teachers in Delhi government schools who have not passed CTET
 kaha ja rahaa he ki isi saptaah buudhvaar ko dilli ke chhatrasaal stadium ke baahar guest teachers ne jo hangaamaa kiya tha, uske baad hi sarkaar kaa yah faisla aayaa he
 Internet buses will be installed in school buses to prevent porn from watching
 We are currently teaching about 17 thousand guest teachers in Delhi schools, who are contracted till May 2017
 ye sabhi naukari ko pakkaa kiye jane kii maang kar rahe hai
 They have been talking to Kejriwal government for a long time but they are not satisfied
 dilli sarkaar ne july 2014 ke samay apanit kiye gaye guest teachers ko hi ab tak ekstansion diya he

 Discussion has also intensified on the PIL filed in the Supreme Court seeking the abolition of Article 35A between political and military movements in Jammu and Kashmir
 daakhil yachika main kaha gaya he ki artical 35A keval bhartiya samvidhan hi nahin balki kashmir kii janata ke saath bhi sabase bada dhokhaa he
 Advocate Ashwani Upadhyay, who filed this PIL in the Supreme Court, says Article 35A was not added by following the procedures laid down in Article 368 amending the constitution, but was illegally pasted by the then government
 samvidhan main sanshodhan kaa adhikaar keval sansad ko he
 Article 35A violates not only the constitutional procedures laid down in Article 368, but also against the basic structure of the Constitution of India
 samvidhan main koi bhi artical jodna yaa ghataana keval sansad dwaara anuchhed 368 main nirdhaarit prakriya ke anusaar hi kiya ja saktaa he
 Whereas article 35A has never been presented before Parliament
 isse yah bhi saaf he ki artical 368 ke tahat sansad kii samvidhan sanshodhan kii shakti ko tab kii sarkaar ne artical 35A ke maamle main darkinar kar diya tha
 It is also argued in the petition that through article 35A, classification based on birth is in violation of article 14
 yah kanoon ke samaksh harek naagarik kii samanta or samvidhan kii mul sanrachana ke khilaaf he
 According to Article 35A, non-resident citizens may not have the same rights and privileges as permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir
 artical 35A ek mahila ko uski marji ke purush ke saath shaadi karne ke baad uske bacchon ko jayjad main haq na dekar uske moulik adhikaar kaa ulanghan karata he
 If a woman marries a man who does not have a permanent residence certificate from Kashmir, her children neither get a permanent residence certificate nor share in the property
 unhen jayjad main hissaa paane ke liye upyukt nahin samajha jaataa he bhale hi mahila ke paas kashmir kii naagarikta ho
 This article also provides an open exemption for violation of fundamental rights of workers and natives like Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who have been residing in Kashmir for many generations
 jin daliton or valmikiyon ko 1950-60 ke bich jammu-kashmir rajya main laayaa gaya tha, unhen is shart par sthaayee nivas pramaan patr diya gaya tha ki ve or unki aane vaali peediyaan rajya main tabhi rah sakati hai, jab ve mailaa dhone vaale bane rahen
 Today, even after serving for six decades in the state, the children of those scavengers are scavengers and have no right to choose any other profession
 sampatti ke swaamitv pratibandhon ke kaaran audyogic kshetra or nijee kshetra ko atyadhik kshati pahunch rahi he
 Good doctor engineer professors do not come to Kashmir
 kashmir ke baahar ke bacchon ko rajkeey collejon main pravesh nahin miltaa he
 It also reduces the rights of refugees from Pakistan
 ve bharat ke naagarik to hai lekin kashmir ke gaiyr-sthaayee nivasee hone ke naate ve jammu kashmir ke sthaayee nivaasiyon dwaara praapt kiye gaye mul adhikaron or visheshadhikaron se vanchit hai
 Upadhyay argues in the petition that Article 35A gives the state government an open freedom to discriminate between the citizens of India on an unfair basis
 isamen ek ke adhikaron ko raundte hue duusare ko adhikaar dene main tarjeeh di jaati he
 Non-residents are prohibited from purchasing property, getting a government job or voting in local elections
 bharat ke raashtrapati ne ek kaaryakari aadesh dwaara samvidhan main artical 35A ko joda, haalanki anuchhed 370 raashtrapati ko bharat ke samvidhan main sanshodhan karne ke liye vidhaayi shaktiyaan pradaan nahin karata he
 Article 35A not only violates the constitutional procedures established by law, but also violates the fundamental rights provided in Articles 14, 15, 16, 19, 21 of the Constitution
 artical 35A manamaane tareeke se thopa gaya he
 It violates the fundamental rights of equality, employment, equal opportunity, trade and business, organization, information, marriage, privacy, shelter, health and education as provided in Articles 14, 15, 16, 19 and 21 of the Constitution 
 isse saaf he ki artical 35A keval bhartiya samvidhan hi nahin balki kashmir kii janata ke saath sabase bada dhokhaa he
 What is Article 35A? - Article 35A has given the Jammu and Kashmir government the right to consider it as a permanent resident and not whom
 -jammu kashmir sarkaar un logon ko sthaayee nivasee maanati he jo 14 may 1954 se pehle kashmir main bas gaye the
 Permanent residents of Kashmir have got special rights in buying land, getting employment and government schemes
 -desh ke kisi duusare rajya kaa nivasee jammu-kashmir main jaakar sthaayee nivasee ke taur par nahin rah saktaa
 Residents of other states can neither buy land in Kashmir nor can the state government give them a job
 -agar jammu-kashmir kii koi mahila bharat ke kisi anya rajya ke vyakti se shaadi kar le to uske or uske bacchon ke property rhite chin liye jate hai
 Omar Abdullah is married to a non-kashmiri woman, but his children have all the rights
 umr abdulla kii bahan sara abdulla kaa nikaah gaiyr kashmiri vyakti se hone ke kaaran sampatti ke adhikaar se vah vanchit kar di gai hai
 The article was added under Article 370 of the Constitution
 Article 35A- Due to Article 35A, the citizens of Jammu and Kashmir have dual citizenship
 -anuchhed 370 kii vajah se jammu kashmir main alag jhanda or alag samvidhan chalata he
 Due to Article 370, the term of the Legislative Assembly in Kashmir is 6 years, while in other states it is 5 years
 -artical 370 ke kaaran bhartiya sansad ke paas jammu-kashmir ko lekar kanoon banane ke adhikaar bahut simit hai
 -pass laws in Parliament are not immediately applicable in Jammu and Kashmir
 shiksha kaa adhikaar, soochna kaa adhikaar, mani landring virdohi kanoon, kalaadhan virdohi kanoon or bhrashtachar virdohi kanoon kashmir main lagu nahin he
 This does not provide reservation here, nor does the law of minimum wage apply
 kya he iskaa kanoonee pahalu?2014 main ve da citigens naam ke ek NGO ne supreme court main arji lagaai thi lekin centre or rajya sarkaar ne apana jawaab ajtak daakhil nahin kiya
 Meanwhile, Charu Khanna, Ladda Ram, Ashwini Upadhyay and Major Ramesh Upadhyay also challenged Article 35A in the Supreme Court
 is samay artical 35A ke khilaaf kul 6 janhit yachikaayen lambit hai
 Apart from article 35A, Ashwini Upadhyay has also challenged the validity of article 370 by filing another petition
 vijay lakshmi jha kii yachika bhi supreme court main 2017 se lambit he lekin centre or rajya sarkaar ne abhi tak apana jawaab daakhil nahin kiya he
 It has been argued in all the petitions that Kashmir was not given special status while framing the Constitution
 yahaan tak ki samvidhan kaa draft banane vaali samvidhan sabha main chaar sadsy khud kashmir se the
 Article 370 is a temporary provision which was made till the situation was normal
 samvidhan nirmaataaon ne yah kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki artical 370 ke naam par 35A jaisaa praavdhaan joda jayega
 Article 35A "A Legislation a Constitution a National Anthem Hits the Sense"
 jammu kashmir main duusare rajyon ke nagarikon ko samaan adhikaar na hona samvidhan ke mul bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 The history of article 35A testifies that it was added to the Constitution in 1954 by an order of the President
 yah aadesh tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru kii cabinet kii salaah par jari hua tha
 Two years before this, in 1952, Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah had a Delhi agreement
 iske tahat bhartiya naagarikta jammu-kashmir ke rajya ke vishyon main lagu karne kii baat thi
 But Article 35A was specifically brought to show the special status of Kashmir
 ab daleel yah di ja rahi he ki yah raashtrapati ke aadesh vaala artical 35A khatm hona chahie
 Because there was no discussion and debate in Parliament on this
 sansad ko bataae bina artical 35A ko ek saamaanya aadesh ke jariye samvidhan main jod diya gaya

 When Sourav Ganguly's name was to be called during the rebound in the bidding process of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in Bangalore, moments before Sahara India president Subrata Roy requested his son Seemanto to be the former Indian captain
 Make one last attempt to join the Pune Warriors team
 lekin teble par simanto roy ke saath baithe coach geoff marsh ne kaha, 'agar aap aisa karte hai, to phir mujhe baksh den
 Shortly after that, Richard Medley, who made a bid, scored a goal from the white cricket ball, proclaiming that Ganguly did not find any buyers, including the Kolkata Knight Riders, whom he had signed four years earlier with filmstar Shah Rukh Khan and the rest of the investors
 With great fervor, it failed to attract the bids of any of the ten franchises
 sari prakriya ghar main tivi par dekhne vaale ganguli ne apane is kaale ravivaar ko koi pratikriya nahin di
 He later played basketball with his daughter Sana and her friends and switched off the mobile to avoid repeated phone calls from reporters crowding the doors of her home in South Kolkata
 lagbhag 48 ghante baad, hatotsahit ganguli ne ek khel channel ke maalik se kaha, 'mujhe nikaalane ke liye aupchaarikta tak nahin barti gai
 This is sad, it should not have happened
 yah apmanjanak he
 Ganguly was one of his emblem players when Lalit Modi started a league full of money and did his special style realty show for the tired twitter laden with well-known faces of auction
 or ab vahi ganguli antarrashtriya str par khel chuke 48 bhartiya cricketron main se un teen khilaadiyon main se ek hai, jinhen koi kharidaar nahin mila, baaki do khilaadi hai- wasim jafar or ve
 R
 ve
 Lion
 ganguli ke liye isse bhi kharaab baat yah thi ki rahul dravid or ve
 V
 es
 Laxman was elected, even though he is more than 35 years old, like Ganguly
 do din kii boli lagane kii prakriya puri hone ke saath hi yah saaf ho gaya ki duniya kii sabase maldaar cricket lig ke chauthe sanskaran main ganguli nahin khelenge
 Subrata Roy made his last attempt on January 12, when he faxed a proposal to Ganguly to join the board of directors of Sahara Adventure Sports, the owner of the Pune Warriors team
 yah ganguli ko ipiel main shaamil karne ke liye pichley daravaaje se pravesh dene kii ek koshish najar ai or kai logon ko shankaa thi ki jab keker koi saaf vaada nahin kar rahaa he, tab kya ganguli ke liye is peshkash ko sweekaar karnaa samajhadaari bharaa kadam hoga
 KKR director Joy Bhattacharya says, 'the decision was entirely professional
 hamaara dhyaan yuva khilaadiyon par he
 'former Indian captain Bishan Singh Bedi agrees,' How can Ganguly face the pressure of Twenty20? He has not been playing competitive cricket for the last two years
 ' royal chalangers bangalore kii taraf se mukhya nirnayakarta kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe anil kumble ne bhi in anbhavi spinner kii baat kaa samarthan kiya, 'yah aadhunik cricket kii nai vaastaviktaa he
 The franchisees are considering three years
 ek saal kaa nahin
 Shah Rukh Khan, the owner of KKR, who left for South Africa by flight just a day before the bid began, told reporters in Durban that he would meet Ganguly after returning, to ease tensions in Kolkata
 Saka, where Ganguly fans have threatened to boycott kkr's matches
 ganguli ke samarthakon kaa tark he ki purv bhartiya captain ne keker kii brandavalu main baari yogadan diya he, lekin maalikon ke peshewar prabandhan kii dharna isse vipareet he
 Was KKR not the only franchise with none of its owners bidding? Yet, there were speculations as to why everyone ignored Ganguly
 kuch ipiel tiimon ke sadsy is baat kii pushti karte hai ki purv bhartiya captain ke peeth peeche kii jane vaali raajnneeti main shaamil hone se maidan ke bheetar or baahar, kai baar gambhir samasyaayein paidaa ho jaati thim
 a source from KKR says, "he is a dangerous person to sit in the dressing room, he always used to provoke one player against another and it was common for him to do so
 ' ve yah bhi kehete hai, 'unhen shaamil na karne ke peeche umr kabhi koi mudda nahin thi
 The issue is about their habits, their nature
 bhartiya cricket kaa har vyakti unki dressing room se raajnneeti karne kii aadat jaanata he
 Such tensions between Ganguly and other players have occurred during previous versions of the IPL, when Shah Rukh Khan had to replace Ganguly and make New Zealand's Brandon mccallum the captain of his team
 iske alaava bhi kuch kaaran hai
 Despite being an integral part of KKR, Ganguly had begun talks about a possible turnaround at the Pune Warriors several months before IPL 4 was planned
 bhattacharya kehete hai, 'keker ke kartadharta unhen bataa rahe the ki ve unhen team ko sanvaarane vaale or ek guru kii bhoomika main rakhana chahenge, lekin ve khel nahin sakenge
 Ganguly did not respond to the offer

 However, at the initiative of a man, some people intervened and saved him
 ek aaropee ne is ghatana kaa video viral kar diya
 On the other hand, the same video also revealed the face of the person, on whose initiative Kashmiri could be saved
 upi kii rajdhani lakhanu
 Two Kashmiris selling dry fruits on the road of Daliganj bridge
 unhen peetate do siyaasi gunde
 The crowd watching the spectacle as usual
 mobile se video banaate chand log
 Two goons wearing saffron kurtas were threatening the Kashmiris sitting on the street with poles in their hands
 gaali de rahe the
 Were beating with poles
 thappad laga rahe the
 He was calling them stone-pelting
 tabhi lakhanu ke rahane vaale ek shaks ne vahaan pahunchakar donon gundon ko roka or sawaal kiya? kyon maar rahe ho bhai in logon ko
 The goons waved the baton and said, "they are stones
" us shaks ne jabaav diya- kanoon haath main kyon lete ho
 Call the police, whatever
 us shaks kii pahal par kuch or log bhi bolne lage
 Kashmiris survived then
 us shaks kaa naam he zafer rizvi
 They did not know who was being beaten and who was being beaten
 wo bas insaaniyat ke naate is maamle main kud pade
 Kashmiris survived
 ghatana kaa video viral ho gaya
 An accused goon was caught
 jo ek peshewar apradhi he
 These are those anti-social elements, who believe in carrying out such misdeeds in order to be highlighted or in the eyes of big leaders
 lekin isi video ke viral hone se zafer rizvi hero ban gaye
 Common people like Rizvi are the people who suddenly become heroes in saving democracy and humanity
 wo kisi makasad yaa phaayde ke liye nahin balki insaaniyat ke liye sadak par hone vaale anyaay ke khilaaf awaz uthaa dete hai
 Or instead of watching the spectacle on the way, it is possible to stop the victim
 kahaan se aati he aise logon main wo takat
 Actually, that power gives them the constitution of India
 hamaara loktantr detaa he
 Which gives everyone equal status
 sabko mehnat or eemaandaaree se roji-roti kamaane kii chhot detaa he
 Which gives you the right to raise your voice against injustice
 apane haq ke liye sawaal karen
 Stop the oppression on any poor community without knowing the caste religion
 aisa hi kiya lakhanu ke zafer rizvi ne
 It is not that Zafar Rizvi wants to come on TV after this incident and his video went viral
 yaa apana naam or photo chamakaana chaahate hon
 The case is quite the opposite
 wo khud is bare main kahin hilite nahin hona chaahate
 This is reflected in his Facebook account
 kai logon ne unhen fasebuk par us viral video ke saath tag kar diya
 After that Zafar wrote in a post that the hero you are making, has not done such a big job
 isse pehle unhone ek fasebuk post likhi
 In which he wrote that don't make heroes, be yourself
 tabhi kuch hoga
 Before writing this post, he had written that the entire man who made the video of the incident was a complete serpent
 yani peedit or unako bhi
 Zafar was so upset by people's tagging, messages and perhaps Facebook calls that he shared his second post and threatened to delete his Facebook account if he was harassed more
 ghatana kaa video viral hone ke baad jafar rizvi ne apni pehali post main saaf likhaa tha ki ve koi hero nahin hai
 If Zafar or anyone else did not stop those 2 goons, then the matter could have escalated
 shaayad khabar bhi kuch or hoti or yah khabar na likhi jaati
 But the point here is to understand that in this era of mob lynching, small talk and intolerance, Zafar's voice and the news related to them is going to give relief
 zafer kii tarah aapaki awaz bhi kisi kii jaan bachaa sakati he
 It is people like Zafar Rizvi who are the real heroes of Indian democracy who become an example for every common man on the street

 Reserve Bank Governor d
 subbarao ne aaj kaha, shaayad siaraar evam esaelaar main katautee karne kii jarurat he
 Earlier, Subbarao disagreed with banks' demand to cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and SLR
 tippaniyan "I understand that there is a demand and there is a need to cut further (CRR and SLR)," the RBI governor said during the annual banking conference 'fibac Summit' here
 paanch saal kaa kaarykaal puraa kar subbarao 4 sitambar ko sevanivrutt ho jaaenge or unki jagah nae governor raghuram rajan lenge
 The CRR currently stands at 4 percent, while the SLR is at 23 percent
 bhartiya state bank ke adhyaksh prateep choudhary ne kuch samay pehle kaha tha ki siaraar ‘susupt dhan he’
 He had said that if the RBI does not reduce it, then at least interest should be paid on the money deposited under it
 arabiai governor ne yahaan vaarshik banking sammelan ‘fibac summit’ ke dauraan kaha, main yah baat samajhataa hum ki isaki maang he or inamen (siaraar va esaelaar) or katautee karne kii jarurat he
 Subbarao will retire on September 4 after completing a five-year term and will be replaced by the new Governor Raghuram Rajan
 vartmaan main siaraar 4 pratishat par he, jabaki esaelaar 23 pratishat he
 State Bank of India President Pratip Chaudhary said sometime back that CRR is 'sound money'
 unhone kaha tha ki yadi arabiai ise kam nahin karata he to kam se kam iske tahat jamaa dhan par byaaj to diya hi janaa chahie

 Farmers of Punjab are in a panic these days
 unhen apane kheton se dhan kii paraali saaf kerani he taaki kheton ko rabi kii fasalon kii buaai ke liye taiyaar kar saken
 They can no longer afford to delay this task - winter has knocked and now they have to plow their fields
 unke khet—jo desh ke kul jameen ke 3 fisadi he—desh kaa 19 fisadi gehun or 12 fisadi dhan ugaate hai
 Although many people criticize the practices of these farmers — burning stubble is of course pollution and fills the area's air with mist and smoke — but this does not change their contribution to the country's food supply
 punjab ke upjau kheton kaa harek hectare takreeban 53 quintal gehun or kareeb 45 quintal chaaval kaa yogadan detaa he
 However, cash crops like cotton, sugarcane and maize are grown in some strips of the state
 magar ye fasalein rajya kii kul krishi paidaavaar kii mahaj kareeb 15 fisadi hi hai
 The cotton strip in the state's Malwa region saw a sharp rise in yields recently - after several years of decline in yields — a result of crop pests like whiteflies and fungi, and the (alleged) supply of fake seeds and fertilizers in the state
 kapaas ugane vaale khet 2
 Increased from 38 lakh hectare to more than 4 lakh hectare this year
 paidaavaar main is badhotaree kii mukhya vajah nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) main ijapha hona tha, jo 2017-18 main 4,220 ru
 Per quintal increased from Rs 5,350 in 2018-19
 kar diya gaya tha
 This year it was further increased to Rs 5,550
 prati quintal kar diya gaya
 As an agricultural state, Punjab has the privilege of flowing many rivers in its territory — particularly Sutlej, Beas and Ravi — and many canals drawn from them
 phir bhi mukhya bhubhag kaa bada hissaa ab bhi bhumigat pani par nirbhar he, jinase sinchai karne ke liye dijal or electric panpon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This is a big challenge facing the state
 dhan kii fasal ko prati kilogram 5,000 litre pani kii jarurat hoti he, jo bijli kii lagaataar aapurti par nirbhar karti he
 Punjab is one of the few states that still provide free electricity to farms
 isse rajya sarkaar ke liye laagat to aakhirkaar bad hi jaati he—arabiai ke aankadon ke mutabik rajya prati hectare kareeb 1
 Spends 5 lakh rupees
 isamen pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi yojana ke tahat fasal or aamadani kaa bharosa dene kii haal kii ghoshnaa shaamil nahin he
 Government data, however, also shows that the average farmer in Punjab is under debt
 niti ayog kii ek haalia report bataati he ki rajya ke ausat gramin ghar-parivaar ke upar kareeb 2
 There is a loan of 12 lakh rupees, which is the highest in the country
 isaki tasdik is baat se bhi hoti he ki 2017 main amarinder singh kii sarkaar kisaanon se karj maafee kaa vaayada karke dhoomdhaam se satta main ai thi
 The good thing is that if there was any effort with the progress of the state in agriculture, then it has completed the improvement in infrastructure
 rajya ke sabhi gaanv ab daamer kii sadakon se jude hai or rajya ke rajmargon main pichley kuch saal ke dauraan jabardast sudhaar aayaa he
 According to RBI data, the ratio of length of network of highways with total land area of punjab is 0
 1 kimi prati varg kimi he or itane hisse par roj lagbhag 84 vaahan guzarate hai
 It is one of the best figures of any state in the country
 saath hi, punjab apane sabhi ghar-pariwaron ko bijli muhaiyaa karwaane vaale sabase pehle rajyon main se ek tha
 At the same time, the National Health Survey shows that almost all the households here have joined the system of providing better drinking water
 rajya main do antarrashtriya hawaii adde pehle se hai—ek chandigarh main or doosraa amritsar main
 The Ministry of Civil Aviation is emphasizing on increasing the number of flights to and from its four domestic airports — Bathinda, Adampur, Ludhiana and Pathankot — under the UDAN scheme
 nishchit rup se aakaar ke lihaaj punjab jitne bade rajya ke liye chah hawaii adde khaas taur par zyada hai
 However, two new infrastructure projects are expected to be handed over by 2020 — an expressway running parallel to National Highway-1 and connecting Delhi to Amritsar and a dedicated freight corridor connecting Delhi to Ludhiana and Dadri
 in pariyojnaon se rajya kii amarinder sarkaar ko ummid he ki kisaanon ke liye behatar sthitiyaan paidaa hongi or unka karj kaa boj bhi kam hoga
 It is better that the farmers who make a big contribution to the food production of the country get some more relief

 In the east of Allahabad, the town area reaches Jhansi as soon as it crosses the river Ganges on the highway going towards Varanasi
 takreeban paanch kilometre aage chalane ke baad dahini taraf ek sadak chhatnag kii ore jaati he
 On the right side of this road, there is a board of 'district Crime Prevention Committee Allahabad' and it is said: 'hate crime, not criminal
 'isi board ke peeche sadak ke duusari taraf vah teen biswa jameen he, jis par kabje ke liye varchasv kii jang se ek baar phir jhunsi main khooni gangvaar kaa daur waapas aa gaya he
 Jhansi, once two kilometers away from the confluence, once infamous for illegal sand mining, is now emerging as the center of the war of supremacy due to land occupation and ethnic conflicts

 Manoj Giri aka Hutan, a resident of Chhatnag village of Jhunsi, who has been accused in every gang war in Jhansi during the past decade, is identified as a sharpshooter criminal in the crime world
 usne jaise hi jameen ke kaarobaar main apane paanv pasaarne shuru kiye, pichley chaar varsh se shant rahe jhunsi main jaateey sangharsh or gangvaar kii patakatha taiyaar ho gai
 Two years ago, on 9 February, when Chhatanag occupied the three-biswa land in Pasi-dominated village Ustapur of Mahmudabad with his muscle power, the spark of domination and ethnic strife broke out as a big gang war
 chhuttan giri or rishi bharti gang aamane-saamne aa gaye
 Shambhu and Harishchandra Bharti of the Pasi fraternity were killed in the firing from both sides
 iske baad daliton ke gusse se jhunsi jal uthaa
 Homes were broken into, and government vehicles and buses were set on fire
 achaanak hue is gangvaar or uske baad chaaron ore faili hinsa ke daur ko kaabo karne ke liye elahabaad ke paanch thanon kii force lagaani padi
 The holiday fell and Rishi Bharti is out of the reach of the police despite a hefty reward being declared on the accused

 "government policies created by the land mafia gang flourishing in Jhansi were the major contribution of the government policy which was brought to prevent illegal occupation on the land of Nuzool in the city
" varsh 1998 main sarkaar ne nujul niyamavali main sanshodhan kar pattedaaron dwaara namit vyakti ke paksh main nujul kii bhoomi freehold karne kaa praavdhaan kar diya or jameen kii keemat 1991 ke cirkil rate ke anusaar aanki
 Anuragha Narayan Singh, MLA from Allahabad North, says, "after the new law, there was a competition to grab cheap land in the middle of the city
 isane shahar main nae bhu-mafia paidaa kiye, jinhone paise ke bal par garib pattedaaron se unki nujul kii jameen kaa apane paksh main namakan karaayaa or uske maalik ban baithe'' agle do-teen varsh main jab shahar main jameen hi nahin bachi to inhone bahari ilaakon kaa rukh kiya
 Due to the high chances of development in Jhunsi, which is on the Banaras Highway, there was a struggle among the land mafia for occupying land here, which suddenly increased the price of land by 20 to 25 times
 paasi, yadav, nishad, kashyap, mallaah, goswami jaisi jati ke logon ko patte par kheti ke liye mili jameen par bhu-mafia kii gidgh drushti lag gai
 In 2005, the dominance of this pure business emerged as a gang war between the two factions of the Jhansi's most affluent caste, the Yadavs
 yah jang ab yadav, paasi or goswami jatiyon ke bich kendrit ho gai he
 Due to the hyperactivity of the police's failure, Chhuti Giri had got a clue of gang war in Jhuns only a year ago
 isi vajah se ganga ke kinare chhatnag main ek police chaowkee kholi jaani thi
 Neither the post opened nor the police captured Jhansi's three big gang donors, even after the Gangster Act was served

 Senior Superintendent of Police, Allahabad, Umesh Chandra Srivastava, while accepting the failure of the administration to stop the gang war, says, "the police will take all necessary measures so that a second gang war does not happen in future
" '' samudr coop, gangotri shivala jaisi aitihaasik dharoharon ke liye prasidgh jhunsi khooni gangvaar se laal he
 Jhunsi, the capital of Pala kings and Chandelas, was also ruled by that stupid king, who is said to be, "andher Nagari Chaupat Raja, Taka Ser Bhaji Taka Ser Khaja

 rigerv bank kii maudrik niti kii samiksha main mudrasphiti main rukh ahm bhoomika nibhaayega
 In Hindi literature, men writing about theater have been dominated by men
 jagadishchandra maathur, nemichandra jain or virendra narayan se lekar govind chatak or devendra raaj ankur tak, sabhi rangamanch aalochakon ne apane lekhan main rangamanch main strivimarsh ko kendrit nahin kiya
 This is the reason why there is no complete book on the contribution of women from Lokmancha to Parsi theater, IPTA movement and later contemporary theater
 chhitput rangasamikshaon or lekhon main stri vimarsh kii charchaa jarur hoti rahi lekin un par shodhaparak kaam hona chahie
 Well-known writer Kamal Kumar has made a small attempt to overcome this deficiency
 rashtriya natya vidhyalay ne haal hi main unki kitaab lokmanch or samakaleen hindi rangamanch kaa stri vimarsh prakashit kii he
 However, this is not a research book nor is there any systematic history of Lok Manch or women discourse
 par yah pehali baar aazaadee ke baad rangamanch main striyon kii bhagidaari kaa ek lekha-jokha he, jise padhakar hindi rangamanch main mahilaon ke sangharsh, yogadan or unki chunautiyon kaa ek jayja mil jaataa he
 This book of about 200 pages has three chapters
 ek adhyay lokmanch par to doosraa adhyay 60 ke baad ke aadhunik rangamanch main striyon kii bhoomika par kendrit he
 The third chapter also has interviews with 35 theater actresses and female directors
 inamen pratibha agarwal, mohini maathur, sudhaa shivpuri, vijaya mehta, uttara baavkar, anjala maharishi, kavita nagpal, girish rastogi, amaal allaanaa, anuraadhaa kapur, surekha sikri, sushamaa seth, ushaa ganguli, tripurari sharma or hema singh jaisi hastiyaan shaamil hai, jinhone rangamanch main ek mukaam hasil kiya he
 Had Sheila Bhatia, Shanta Gandhi and Neelam Mansingh also been in this list, it would have been more prosperous
 phir bhi in bhentvaartaon se pathakon ko nai jaankariyaan milti hai
 Kamal Kumar has outlined in the book the life struggle of women artists, their personality development and their contribution
 unhone is baat par chintaa vyakt kii he ki nat-nati ke yug se lekar aaj tak rangamanch main striyaan shirkat karti raheen lekin is peshey main varchasv purushon kaa hi bana rahaa
 Female artists remained neglected in the Lok Manch and no history was written in their Quaid
 desh ke vibhinn bhaagon main lok manch kii anek sheliyaan raheen jinhone logon ko rangamanch kaa aswaad diya
 But they were seen as a form of folk entertainment and not included in the mainstay of the theater
 is tarah gramin or shahari rangamanch kaa vibhed kaayam rahaa
 In the first chapter, Kamal Kumar discusses various folk styles and mentions Pandavani's famous artists Teejan Bai and Shantibai Chelak
 isamen shantibai kaa ek intervyuu bhi he
 Had Teejan Bai also been interviewed, the book would have been completed
 darasal, pandvani main kai lok kalakaar hai jo agyaat hai
 Artists of our entire folk art lived in oblivion
 gulabo bai ke nidhan ke kai saal baad un par kitaab ai, tab bauddhik samaaj ko unke mahatv ke bare main pataa chalaa
 In the later sixties, Kamal Kumar has tried to explain through plays presented by female directors and actors that female artists-color workers have changed the idiom of theater in many ways
 1960-65 ke aasapaas isamen se adhiktar mahila rangakarmiyon kaa pravesh rangamanch kii duniya main hua or 1980 aate-aate unki rashtriya str par pahunch ban gai
 After this, two-three more generations came to the theater and the whole scenario changed
 1980 tak stri rangavimarsh padaavalee kii charchaa tak nahin thi or na is par koi kaaryshaala sangoshtee hui
 But later the National School of Drama also outlined it separately
 pustak se stri rangarmiyon ke jivan or sangharsh tathaa rangamanch kii duniya main unke saath bhedbhaav kii bhi kathaayen milti hai
 But all the female artists also have the confidence to get the floor
 camel kumaar badhai kii paatr hai ki unhone ek aadhaar taiyaar kiya he jis par stri vimarsh kii bahes aage bad sake

 *** The central government has opposed the 'totalized counting' of votes in the Supreme Court
 centre ne apane halafname main kaha he ki is mudde par kendriya grahamantri kii aguwai main mantrimandal samooh ne vichaar kiya
 The final meeting was held on 16 September 2016
 is meeting main ye tay hua ki booth ke aadhaar par matganana party or ummidavaar ke liye behatar he kyonki isse party yaa pratyaashee ko ye pataa chal jaataa he ki kis ilaake main use zyada vot mili hai or kis hisse main use or kaam karnaa chahie
 The government has also said that this argument is not correct that in areas where people did not vote, they will not work after winning
 ye media activism ke jamaane main sambhav nahin he
 If someone does this, such matters will spread immediately on the media and social media, which will put pressure on the public representative and the party
 vaise bhi chunaav ayog ne kaha he ki ye kadam prayog ke taur par nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki chunaav ke liye pehle se puri taiyaari kii jaati he
 The comments centre ne ye bhi kaha he ki ise lagu karne ke liye 100 karod rupee kaa atirikt kharch aayega
 During the hearing, Chief Justice of India Justice JS Khehar said that tampering of EVM machines is not impossible in the current era
 yahaan tak ki duniya kaa sabase viksit desh bhi achoota nahin he
 He never says that tampering with evms is not possible
 wo desh kahata he ki chhedchhad nahin ho sakati
 Chief Justice Khehar has disassociated himself from the hearing, making these remarks on a public interest litigation filed against counting of booths after the election in the country
 ab maamle kii sunwaayee duusari bench karegi
 In fact, in the petition filed in the Supreme Court, it is said that during the counting of votes, the votes are counted on the basis of the booth, which shows that the people of which area have voted for which candidate
 isse jeetne vaala pratyaashee us ilaake se bhedbhaav karata he jahaan ke logon ne vot nahin diya
 Therefore the votes should be counted simultaneously
 is maamle main chunaav ayog ne is par sahmati jataate hue daleel di thi ki ise lekar centre sarkaar ke paas prastaav bheja gaya he
 The Supreme Court had expressed displeasure over the central government and asked why it is not implementing this rule
 centre ne ye bhi kaha he ki ise lagu karne ke liye 100 karod rupee kaa atirikt kharch aayega

 darasal supreme court main daakhil yachika main kaha gaya he ki philhal matagananana ke dauraan booth ke aadhaar par voton kii ginati hoti he jisase ye pataa chal jaataa he ki kis ilaake ke logon ne kis pratyaashee ko vot diya he
 The winning candidate discriminates against the area where the people did not vote
 isliye voton kii ginati ek saath honi chahie
 In this case, the Election Commission had agreed that the proposal has been sent to the Central Government regarding this
 supreme court ne centre sarkaar par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue poocha tha ki wo is niyam ko lagu kyon nahin kar rahi he? BJP leader Kirti Azad praised Rakhi Sawant and targeted Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal
 aaazaad ne kaha ki raakhi ne apane kaam kii badaulat desh main naam kamaaya lekin kejariwal ne kuch bhi nahin kiya
 He said, 'the work that Kejriwal did in the past, is nothing more than the insistence of a spoiled child
 kirti ne raakhi kii tarif or kejariwal kii aalochana kar shiv sena adhyaksh uddhav thakare kii baat kaa samarthan kiya he
 Uddhav had said in the Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' that Rakhi Sawant would run a better government than Kejriwal
 bijepi netaa ne kejariwal par waar karte hue kaha ki ve unhen samajhadaar samajhate the
 Referring to Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti, Kirti Azad said that earlier he used to look at him with respect but his and his party's actions have brought the reality of the Aam Aadmi Party
 mahila ke saath kiye abhadra vyavhaar ke kaaran somnath bharti ko turant barkhaast karnaa chahie
 Kirti Azad said, 'rakhi Sawant has earned a name in the country through her work
 main unki saraahna karata hum
 i also had a lot of respect for Arvind Kejriwal
 main unase kabhi yah apeksha nahin rakhata tha ki vah ganatantr diwas ke maukey par desh kii rajdhani dilli main misr ke taharir chowk sa maahaul bana denge
 i used to think of him as a very intelligent man but now he is stubborn like a spoiled child
 'bijepi netaa ne kaha, 'jo shaks desh ke samvidhan, desh ke kanoon ke khilaaf kaam karegaa, hamaari party uske khilaaf rahegi
 If Kejriwal & Co
 really wants to do something for the safety of women, then Somnath Bharti should be sacked immediately
 bharti ne jis tarah mahilaon ke saath abhadra vyavhaar kiya, isaki ummid nahin kii ja sakati he
 Somnath Bharti is Law Minister and also a lawyer
 unhen yah nahin pataa ki kanoon mahilaon kii giraftaar ke bare main kya kahata he

 isse pehle pakistan ne sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (UNSC) main kashmir kaa mudda uthaaya tha lekin vahaan par pakistan ko munh kii khaani padi
 Almost all the countries of the United Nations Security Council (except China) returned him to the Bearang
 modi sarkaar ke jammu-kashmir kaa vishesh darja khatm karne ke baad se hi pakistan kashmir mudde kaa antarrashtriyakaran karne main juta hua he, lekin use har jagah se haar hi mil rahi he
 Pakistan only had China with the UN Security Council
 bharat kii kootneeti ne china kii koshishon ko naakaam kar diya
 Saeed Akbaruddin, India's permanent ambassador to the United Nations, targeted Pakistan at UNSC
 unhone kaha ki pakistan jehad ke naam par bharat main hinsa failaa rahaa he
 We stand by our policy as always
 anuchhed 370 hataanaa bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 The decision taken on Kashmir should not make any sense to outsiders

 India was accused of violating human rights in Jammu and Kashmir in a statement by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry
 saath hi sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad (UNCS) se kashmir ke halaat par najar rakhane kii guhaar lagaai gai he
 Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in his statement that Pakistan is not hostile to the dialogue but Kashmir and Kashmiris should be third parties besides india-pakistan in this dialogue
 suraksha parishad se guhaar lagaate hue pakistan ne bharat sarkaar par kashmir ke prati nirdayee hone kaa aarope lagaate hue kaha he ki vah aisi sarkaar or maujuuda vaataavaran main bharat se baatcheet nahin kar saktaa

 The case of Dahi Handi program to be held on the occasion of Janmashtami in Mumbai has once again reached the Supreme Court
 maharashtra sarkaar ne supreme court main us aadesh ko spasht karne kii guhaar lagaai he, jisamen 12 saal tak ke bacchon ko dahi handi main hissaa lene kii ijaajat di gai thi

 The organizers appealed to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court stayed the decision of the High Court allowing children up to 12 years of age to participate, but the Supreme Court later disposed of the petition
 ASG ke mutabik, ab hoicourt is maamle main adaalat kii avmaananaa kaa maamla maanate hue sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 In such a situation, the Supreme Court should clarify its order that after all this exemption was only for the same year or will continue to apply
 supreme court ne kaha ki vah maamle kii jald sunwaayee karegaa
 The government says whether the order was for a year or is still in force
 supreme court jald hi maamle kii sunwaayee ko raji ho gaya he
 ASG Tushar Mehta, on behalf of the Maharashtra government, told the Supreme Court that in August 2014, the Bombay High Court had said in its order that youth below 18 years of age cannot participate in Dahi Handi and its height should not exceed 20 feet

 The palwal-new delhi-ghaziabad local train derailed in the capital Delhi
 palaval se aa rahi memu (menline electric multiple unit) train ke duusare dibbe kaa pahiyaa okhla stesan par subah 9
 Derailed at 45
 is pahie ke eksal main kharabi kii sambhaavna bataai ja rahi he
 According to DRM RN Singh of Delhi Division, no railway passenger was hurt in this accident
 unhone bataaya ki haadase kii kya vajah rahi he iske liye jaanch ke aadesh de die gaye
 Passengers aboard the train were alighted at Okhla station and were flown to the destination from the second MEMU 24901
 is train main rojaanaa dilli se gajiabad aane-jane vaale yatri safar karte hai
 With the help of Lucas Jack, the above wheel of the carriage was back on track and this rack of memu has been sent to the yard for examination
 okhla railway stesan par memu train ke patari se utarane ke maamle main agar najar daalen to ye saaf saaf najar aa rahaa he ki maikenical kharabi kii vajah se train kaa pahiyaa patari se utraa he
 When a train departs on its journey, it is sent to the yard to check and then run on the track
 haadase vaali jagah kaa muyna karne ke baad ye baat saaf taur par dikh rahi he ki okhla railway stesan par pahunchane se pehle pahiyaa patari se utar gaya tha
 Sleepers have broken due to an iron wheel on a railway line of about 530 meters
 okhla stesan par rokane ke liye memu train kii raftaar kam thi or shaayad yaheen vajah he ki is haadase main koi hataahat nahin he
 Suppose that had this wheel derailed long before the station, this accident could have been terrible for hundreds of passengers on the train
 railmantri piyush goyal ne sefti ke maamle main kisi bhi tarah kii kotahi na karne ke aadesh de rakhe hai or is vajah se trainen kaaphi deree se chal rahi hai
 Despite all this, the separation of the wheel from the moving train in Rajdhani, Delhi, seems to be a matter of negligence of the railways
 rajdhani dilli main pichley dinon ranchi rajdhani patari se utari thi or isamen kisi ko bhi chot nahin ai thi
 Due to derailment of this train, the track was found to be outdated
 is ghatana ke baad nai dilli railway stesan par lakdi ke sabhi sleeper badal kar treks ko durust kar diya gaya
 Due to negligence in the railways, 23 people were killed in the Khatauli railway accident
 haal hi main chitrakoot ke pasvasco di gamma expresspatari se utar gai or usamen teen logon kii maut ho gai
 In the midst of recurring accidents, it seems that even after Piyush Goyal became Railway Minister, the journey of railways is going on only on Lord's trust

 aatank kaa aaka abu baqar al bagdadi vaaki ajeeb he
 In recent times, the most intriguing puzzle about someone's death has been figured out, that's it
 isaki zindagi agar chhalaava he to maut ek paheli
 For one and a half years it had kept silence of death
 ab dedh saal baad achaanak phir se bol uthaa he
 It is reported that ISIS and its leader have reached Somalia from Syria after the boria-bed was tied to Iraq and Syria
 somalia banaaieska nayaa thikaana
 is's new land is being prepared in Somalia
 somalia main hi chupa he aies kaa sargana bagdadi
 America is also eyeing Somalia
 aies or bagdadi kaa jinn kareeb dedh saal baad ek baar phir bottle se baahar aa gaya he
 The end of Baghdadi and his IS is suddenly alive again for the world
 khabaron ke mutabik pehle iraq or phir syria main apni zamin khone ke baad bagdadi aatank ke apane lashkar ke saath somalia kii sarazamin par ja pahunchaa he
 And now from there he is trying to create a new life inside IS
 america samet baaki duniya ab ye jaanane main lagi he ki aakhir bagdadi ne somalia ko hi kyon chunaa
 In fact, in Albania, the gambit is that now it is the biggest business to steal, kidnapping, looting a ship at sea and then asking for a ransom
 kanoon se zyaada yahaan aatanki guton kaa raaj chalata he
 Things like failed administration and civil war are Somalia's biggest problem
 or mulk ke zyaadaatar hisson main aatanki sanghathan al shabaab kaa aatank he
 And all these situations can prove extremely helpful in preparing Baghdadi new ground of terror
 khabar he ki pichley saal ke aakhir main syria or iraq par apana kabza khone ke baad haal ke dinon main islamic state ne somalia main apni jaden jamaani shuru kar di hai
 IS attacks have also increased there
 haal main hi dakshin somalia ke loar shabel ilaake main aies ne 14 logon ko maarane kaa daawa kiya he
 Statistics related to IS attacks in Somalia from January to July 2018 indicate that IS activities in this country are increasing
 aies kaa daawa he kisomaliamein usne suniyojit tareeke se kai hamale kiye hai
 Some attacks that were carried out during the day have also been filmed
 shuru main zyaadaatar hamale dakshin-pashchimi shahar afgoye main karne kaa daawa kiya gaya
 But most of the attacks have been taking place in the cities around the capital Mogadishu recently
 aankadon ke mutabik aies ne is saal janvari se july tak somalia main 39 hamale kiye hai
 Of these, 27 attacks were carried out only in May, June and July
 2017 main aies ne puure saal ke dauraan somalia main 21 hamale karne ke daawey kiye the
 This means that IS attacks in Somalia are increasing
 aies ne zyaadaatar ghaat lagaakar yaa goli markar hatyaein kii lekin kuch main impruveizd explosive divaais yani iidi kaa istemaal bhi kiya gaya
 The targets of IS were intelligence officers, Somali police and military personnel
 haalanki aies kii gatividhiyaan badhane ke baavjood somalia main inke hamale philhal chote rahe hai
 In Somalia, IS is confronted with the terrorist organization al-shabaab, which often carries out major and deadly attacks on the military, government and African forces
 or asal main al-shabaab kii maujuudagi somalia main aies ke vistaar main roda he
 Information about IS attacks in Somalia is given by its media wing Amaq
 amaaq kii zyadatar report main hamale yaa uske baad kii tasviren yaa video hote hai
 Those who think that they have been filmed very closely
 inhen aksar din ke ujaale or saarvajanik ilaakon main logon ke saath filmaaya gaya he
 IS has so far produced a single propaganda video dedicated to Somalia
 jise disambar 2017 main jari kiya gaya tha
 In which it was incited to attack against 'western Target' during Christmas and New Year
 aies saal 2015 ke aakhir se somalia main apni upasthiti kaa daawa karata rahaa he
 Most of the people involved in this have been brought to the rival al-shabase
 abdikadir mumin ko somalia main aies charampanthiyon kaa sargana bataaya jaataa rahaa he
 Mumin and some of his fighters have come from al-shabaab and in October 2015 he was shown taking a pledge in a video with IS chief Abu Bakr al-baghdadi
 tab aies charam par tha
 This Saugand was followed by a media campaign of the IS, which appealed to the people of al-shabaab to join the IS
 haalanki al-shabaab ke dabadabe kii vajah se aies ladaakon ko somalia main apni pakad banane ke liye naakon chane chabane pad rahe hai
 Because al-shabaab is openly sweeping IS extremists in the country
 yahaan tak ki apane un sadasyon kaa bhi jo aies main shaamil hona chaahate the yaa unke prati jhukaav rakhte the
 However, the US believes that the IS fighters of Somalia are buying weapons from Yemen itself

 Will the actual script of the story that started in 2002 be written in 2013? In the national session of BJP in 2002, the question was only Narendra Modi and after 11 years in 2013, the question will be Modi in Goa session
 2002 main narendra modi ko gujarat ke siem ke pad ko chhodane kaa sawaal tha
 In 2013 there is a question of handing over the command of 2014 to Modi
 2002 main modi ke chaheton ne bisaat aisi bichhaayi ki modi kii gaddi barkaraar rah gayi
 And it is believed that in 2002, Rajdharma was defeated and Modi won
 vahiin 2013 main ab modi ke liye redcarpet dilli main to bich chuki he lekin redcarpet par modi chalenge kab, is aas main goa adhiveshavan shuukravaar se shuru ho rahaa he
 And the question is once again Modi
 2002 ke vakt gujarat dango ko bijepi pachaa nahin paa rahi thi kyonki us vakt kendra main bijepi kii hi aguwai main endie kii sarkaar thi
 But in 2013, the BJP needs Modi's leadership because it wants to take power at the center
 yani jo modi 2002 main vaajapeyi sarkaar ke liye daag the vahi modi 2013 main bijepi ko satta tak pahunchane ke liye turup kaa patta ban chuke hai
 That is, if Modi holds the 2014 mission, then the number of BJP mps will increase, but the conflict within the BJP is that with the arrival of Modi, the seat increases but the power still remains
 yani bijepi ko un sahyogiyon kaa bhi saath chaiye jo ayodhya, kaaman civil code or dhara 370 ko thande baste main dalwakar bijepi ke saath khadey huye the
 Therefore, the question is not whether Modi's name is announced in Goa
 sawaal yah he ki 2002 main kaman vaajapeyi ke paas thi jo modi ko rajdharm kaa paath padhaa rahe the or 2013 main bijepi modi kii sawari karne ja rahi he, jahaan gujarat se aage ke modi ke rajdharm kii nayi patakatha kaa intjaar har koi kar rahaa he
 Chandrababu, Ajit Singh, Chautala, Naveen Patnaik, Jayalalithaa, Mamta Banerjee, Ram Vilas Paswan, Farooq Abdullah, Shibu Soren and Karunanidhi
 yah das chehre aise hai jo 2002 ke vakt bijepi ke saath the to endie kii sarkaar bani hui thi or chal rahi thi
 But since 2004 till 2013, there is no confidence in the BJP that the NDA should stand again and come back to form the government
 lekin 2014 ko lekar ab narendra modi ko jis tarah prachaar samiti ke commander ke taur par bijepi gujarat ke baahar nikaalane par sahmati bana chuki he, aise main bijepi ko apni ummid to siten badhaane ko lekar jarur he lekin maujuuda vakt main bijepi ke paas kul jamaa teen bade saathi he
 Nitish Kumar, Uddhav Thackeray and Prakash Singh Badal
 or isamen bhi nitish kumaar modi kaa naam aate hi gathbandhan se baahar kaa rasta naapane ko taiyaar hai
 There is a danger of a dent in your own vote bank when Modi's name comes in front of Shiv Sena
 to vah dabi jubaan main kabhi sushamaa swaraj to kabhi adwani kaa naam oochhaalane se nahin kataraati he
 But if you read the mood BJP is in about Modi, three things clearly emerge
 pehla- modi kii lokapriyata bhunaane par hi bijepi ke vot badhengen
 Secondly, BJP will not want to lose its profit based on the helplessness of allies
 or teesraa- modi kii aguwai main agar bijepi 180 ke aankade tak bhi pahunchati he to naye sahyogi saath aa khadey ho sakate hai
 And for the time being, Modi wants to lay the same board in Goa session to indicate that the political parties opposed to Modi may have their own compulsion to contest the election but after the election, if the BJP is in a position to reach power then Everyone will stand with the BJP
 australia ke mahaan ballebaaj sar don bradmen ko bhale hi sachin tendulkar kii ballebaaji style main apni jhalak milti ho lekin england ke purv cricketer tony shillinglau ne ek adhyayan ke jariye daawa kiya he ki takneekee taur par donon cricketron main jameen aasmaan kaa fark tha

 Tony told the Sydney Morning Herald, "it is a myth that Bradman gets a glimpse while watching Tendulkar's batting
" donon main bahut kam samanta he
 Tendulkar is a traditional batsman while Bradman used to find new ways to beat the ball
 bradmen ne 1996 main ek intervyuu main kaha tha ki unhone apni patni ko sachin kii ballebaaji style dekhne ko kaha or usne bhi sweekaar kiya ki donon kii style main samaantaayen hai
 Tony said, "inzamam is the closest to Bradman in all the batsmen I've seen
" bhale hi vah baari bharkam rahe hon
 His timing and footwork were similar to Bradman's

 In the wake of the much-awaited World T20 match between India and Pakistan in Kolkata on March 19, Gautam Gambhir, who was the player of India's World Cup winning team, has said that the focus of the team should be on winning the title and not On the match between India and Pakistan
 2007 main tii-20 or 2011 main vanade world cap jeetne vaali team kaa hissaa rahe gambhir ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan kaha, ‘‘yah sab media ne tiarapy hasil karne ke liye maahaul taiyaar kiya he
 More important than 'that' match is that whoever plays in the World Cup wants to win the trophy
 bharat or pakistan ke bich match sirf ek anya match kii tarah hi he
 '' unhone kaha, ‘‘log ise lekar hip banaate hai, lekin agar aap khilaadi se puuchhen to ve ise ‘us’ match kii tarah nahin dekhte
 The big goal is to win the World Cup
 ’’ Gambhir did not mention any team in the World Cup as his favorite team, but said that the Indian team would be under pressure to play at home
 tippaniyan He said, "I am very happy with the way India is playing
 maine jaise kaha ki tii-20 main kisi ek team ko jeet kaa daavedaar bataanaa mushkil he, kyonki koi bhi khilaadi match palat saktaa he
 " gambhir ne kaha, "bharat par ghar main khilne kaa kaaphi dabaav rahegaa
 You are playing at home, so everyone expects a good performance from you
 bharat jis group main he vah kaaphi mushkil he
 His group has teams like Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan which are difficult to guess
 " Gambhir, who was part of the team that won the T20I in 2007 and the ODI World Cup in 2011, said during an event, "all this media has created an atmosphere for achieving TRP
" ‘us’ match se adhik mahatvapurn yah he ki jo bhi world cap main kheltaa he vah trophy jeetna chahta he
 The match between India and Pakistan is just like any other match
 ’’ He said, "people make hype about it, but if you ask the player, they don't see it like that match
" bada lakshya world cap jeetna hota he
 '' gambhir ne world cap main kisi bhi team ko apni pasandida team nahin bataaya, lekin kaha he ki bhartiya team par ghar main khilne kaa dabaav hoga
 The comments unhone kaha, "jis tarah se bharat khel rahaa, usase main kaaphi khush hum
 Like i said, it is difficult to tell a single team in T20 as a winning contender, because any player can reverse the match
 " Gambhir said, "there will be a lot of pressure on India to play at home
 aap ghar main khel rahe hai, isliye har kisi ko aapse achche pradarshan kii ummid hoti he
 The group India is in is very difficult
 uske group main australia, newjiland or pakistan jaisi timen hai jinke bare main anumaan lagaana mushkil he
 " unhone kaha, ‘‘log ise lekar hip banaate hai, lekin agar aap khilaadi se puuchhen to ve ise ‘us’ match kii tarah nahin dekhte

 uskaa itnaa hi kahana tha ki ek doosraa graahak tapaak se bol padaa ki
 
 bolie vaah modiji vaah
 
 
 On this, the customer who bought the whole onion said that what can Modiji do in it
 aam logon main kaayam pradhanmantri narendra modi kii is lokapriyata kaa andaja itane se hi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 On the unemployment and economy front, the Modi government is facing challenges
 lekin phir bhi piem modi lokapriy bane hue hai
 Since assuming power, the Modi government has been facing constant ups and downs

 Reservation for the Poor Savarnas: In the last months of his last term, the Modi government suddenly introduced a bill, which proposed 10 percent reservation to the upper castes, Muslims and Christians in the education sector and government jobs, which could be considered economically backward

 is anuchhed ko waapas liye jane se pehle sarkaar ne kaaphi saavdhaanee barti or rajya main baari suraksha balon kii tainaati or paryatakon ko rajya se turant baahar nikalne ko kaha
 With the decision of Modi government to abrogate 370, the violence which was being expressed was proved unfounded

 Demonetisation was raised on GST
 In fact, when the Modi government took over power in India in May 2014, the economy was staggering
 mahangaai dar main koi sudhaar nahin tha or vittiya ghaataa 2003 ke etharabm (phiscal rispansbility and bajet management matlab rajkoshiya daayitv or bajet prabandhan) vyavastha ke tahat nirdhaarit seemaa se kahin adhik tha
 Prosenjit Dutta, who was the editor of Business Today, says in an article that initially the Modi government seemed to be doing everything right
 vaishvik str par kachche tel kii keemton main giravat se bhi sarkaar ko phayda pahunchaa tha, kyonki rajkoshiya munafa badha jo us samay kii badi jarurat thi
 This attracted foreign investors, sparked manufacturing competition, controlled the fiscal deficit and took on businessmen who were unable to repay loans
 modi sarkaar ne jab yah dekha ki jarurat se zyada kshamta or purana karj dho rahi privet companiyaan nivesh karne se kataraa rahi hai to sarkaar ne aarthik vikaas ko badhaava dene or rojgaar or maang banane ke liye buniyadi dhaanche par kharch karnaa shuru kar diya
 This measure worked and from 2016 the economy started getting better
 magar phir 8 november, 2016 kaa din notebandi kaa jhatka lekar aayaa
 This one move jolted the economy, swallowing 86 percent of the currency
 gramin kshetron or anaupchaarik arthvyavastha ko nuksaan hua
 To overcome this situation, the government took another decision of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 kaha gaya ki isse kaarobaar kshetra main uthaa-patake much gai
 The biggest drawback of GST was stated to be the principle of One Nation, One Tax

 Rajan Jha reminds that in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, everyone felt that the Congress would challenge the bjp-led NDA
 kyonki congress ne teen rajyon madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Rajan Jha says that but the equation changed after the Pulwama attack
 pakistan ke balakot main air strike ne loksabhaa chunaav ke nattejey ko badal kar rakh diya, or parinaam yah hua ki bijepi ne 2014 ke mukaable 2019 main adhik mat pratishat ke saath jeet hasil kii
 Even though strong in terms of population, the resentment of the Dalit community did not reflect the outcome of the Lok Sabha elections
 vah kehete hai ki maharashtra aurharyana vidhansabha chunaavse pehle bhi modi sarkaar ne kadaa faisla liya or jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko nirast kar diya or in chunaavon main bijepi badi party banakar ubhari
 Overall, one can say that by the time the opposition party questions one of the decisions of the Modi government, he has taken some other step, and the same trend is also a big reason for his popularity

 This is due to the increase in the prices of fireworks by 50 to 60 percent this year compared to the previous year
 darasal, tamilnadu ke shivakashi main pichley kuch varshon main hue haadason ke baad paristhitiyaan bhi badal gai hai or niyam-kanoon bhi sakht ho gaye hai
 Secondly, now the trust of people on Chinese firecrackers has also reduced, because most of the Chinese firecrackers are not right and there is a danger from them
 deshi pataakhon main khatra adhik hone kii vajah se jila prashasan ne tej aawaaj ke pataakhe banane or bechney par pehle hi roak laga di he
 Wholesale traders are also adding their profits due to supply shortage and inflation
 matlab saaf he ki pichley varsh jo log ek hajaar rupee kaa pataakhaa jalaate the, unhen is varsh vahi pataakhaa 1500 se 1600 rupee main milegaa
 Crackers up to 10 rupees will be found of very poor quality
 thok vyavsaayiyon kii maane to 50 rupee se neeche acha pataakhaa milanaa aasaan nahin hoga
 Fireworks Trade Welfare Association President Akhilesh Gupta says that only firecrackers made at Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu are supplied throughout the country
 haal ke kuch varshon main shivakashi main hue haadason ke baad se vahaan bhi aatishbaajee kaa kaarobaar kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 He said that the rules and regulations have become so strict that apart from loud firecrackers, there has been a ban on making more ammo crackers
 upar se mahangaai or naksali ilaakon main barood kii badhati khapat ke andeshe ke chalate bhi prashasan dukandaaron par nigaraanee rakh rahaa he
 Gupta said that raw materials including paper made in firecrackers have also become twice as expensive

 The crackers made have not dried up either

 Officials of the organization say that they are trying their best to make all kinds of crackers available to the people of the capital, but this time traders will not be able to compromise the price
 tay daam par hi pataakhaa milegaa
 Small traders have also been told in advance that due to lack of supply, they will also be given fireworks in fixed quantity
 tej aawaaj kii apeksha is baar kam aawaaj or phuljhadi vaale pataakhon kii bikri ko variyata di jaaegi
 Akhilesh Gupta says that it will not be possible to supply the entire supply from the firecrackers made in the district

 Therefore, this time branded firecrackers made from Kanpur have also been ordered in large quantities

 Firecrackers wholesalers state that Indian traders have stopped selling it due to the low profit in Chinese firecrackers

 camel hasan- apane chaahane waalon ke liye universal hero kii tarah he, jo pichley kai maheenon se apane vivaadaaspad bayanon ke chalate surkhiyon main bane hue hai
 Haasan is hinting at entering Tamil Nadu politics
 ve lagaataar vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke netaaon se mil rahe hai
 These include leaders such as Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal
 ab camel hasan ne apane ek or bayaan dekar vivaad khadaa kar diya he
 The famous film actor said that Hindu people cannot talk to people who talk about terrorism, because terror has also reached the Hindu camp
 camel hasan ke is bayaan ke baad bijepi netaa subrahmanyam swami or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh vichaarak rakesh sinha ne palatwaar kiya he
 After all, what did Kamal Haasan say? Taking a direct attack on those doing right-wing politics, Kamal Haasan said that earlier right-wing Hindus were not involved in violence, they used to protest their opponents on the basis of arguments
 lekin, ye puraani ranneeti haar gai or ab ve jo karte hai, usamen bal prayog hota he
 Haasan said, 'now they have started spreading violence
 'camel hasan ne kaha, 'hindu aatankwaad kii baat kehane vaale logon ko dakshinpanthi chanlej nahin kar sakate hai, kyonki aatank hindu camp main bhi pahunch gaya he
 Such terrorist activities will not help them in any way
 'bijepi saansad subrahmanyam swami ne kiya palatvaarkmal ke bayaan par palatwaar karte hue bijepi netaa subrahmanyam swami ne kaha, 'camel hasan eemaandaar vyakti nahin hai or na hi nishpaksh hai
 If it had been, they would have told the NIA to go or register a complaint, which they did not do
 swami ne kaha ki wo chaapluus aadmi hai
 When we were running corruption cases against Jayalalithaa, he sat down in the bill like a rat, till today he did not participate in any public movement
 'unhone kaha ki uski teen filmein flop ho chuki hai isliye ab cinema se ritairement chahta he
 Therefore, giving such a statement
 uskaa kuch hone vaala nahin he, isliye communiston kii chapalusee kar rahaa he
 Lenin said that many idiots are also fruitful
 swami ne kaha ki wo aadharahin aarope laga rahe hai, unke paas koi saboot nahin he
 RSS ideologue Rakesh Sinha also counterattacked RSS thinker Rakesh Sinha said that Kamal Haasan is talking about Hindu terror in Tamil Nadu under the influence of PFI and Al Ummah
 hindu sabhyataa ke apmaan or bhaawanaaon ko aahat karne ke liye unhen maafee maangani chahie
 Kamal Haasan tries to provoke emotions
 unhone kaha ki samay bahut mahatvapurn he, jab kendriya agenciyon ne piefai par bain lagane kii baat kahi, to camel hasan ne hindu aatank kii baat kahkar use bachaane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Vinay Katiyar said - now Kamal Hasanahindu, who is no longer a superstar, hit back at Kamal Haasan on the statement of terrorism, BJP leader Vinay Katiyar said that he is no longer a superstar
 unki sari filmein pit rahi hai
 So they are making such statements
 unke upar cese darj hona chahie or vahaan kii sarkaar ko achche aspataal main unka ilaaj karnaa chahie
 Hindus cannot be terrorists
 puure duniya main islamic aatankwaad hai
 Their terror camps go on
 unako kashmir main jaakar dekhnaa chahie
 Then they will understand what is Islamic terrorism? The way they are praising the Chief Minister of Kerala, it seems that they are influenced by the Left leaders
 lihaaja is tarah ke bayaan de rahe hai
 After getting beaten in films, now he wants to get into politics
 isliye wo hindu or muslim main bantwaare kii raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai
 Kamal Haasan should be booked
 agar uske paas saboot nahin hon, to jail bhejkar usko jail kii hawa bhi khilaani chahie
