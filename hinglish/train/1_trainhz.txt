 Ever since Narendra Modi took power at the center in 2014, the Congress has been trying to keep the opposition parties united, it was first tried by Sonia Gandhi and now by Rahul Gandhi Is going vipakshi ekajutata kaa phayda 2015 main bihar chunaav main dikhaa jab 'mahagathbandhan' ne bhartiya janata party ko dhul chataayee, isse pehle nai naveliam aadmi party dilli main clin sweep karte hue congress or bijepi ko satta se dur kar diya tha
 After trying to unite the opposition, the Congress has lost the assembly elections in several states in the last 3-4 years and once again the Congress has started emphasizing on the opposition unity and for this, Rahul Gandhi is in touch with regional parties
 udhaahranswarup congress kaa gujarat main yuva netaaon hardik patel or jignesh mewaani ko saath rakhana yaa phir karnataka main tisare number par rahane vaali jedies ko samarthan dekar congress ne na sirf bijepi ko satta se dur kiya balki khud ko satta main banaae rakhaa
 Seeing the benefit of alliances at the regional level, Rahul Gandhi Trinamool also kept in touch with Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Jayant Chaudhary, Baspasuprimo Mayawati and many other regional leaders
 kejariwal se durilekin in sab ke baavjood rahul gandhi ne pichley 3 saal main aam aadmi party auradilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejarivalse kisi tarah kaa sampark nahin kiya he
 The distance between the two remains
 khaas baat yah he ki rahul or arvind donon hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke mukhar aalochak hai or lagaataar un par hamalaa kar rahe hai, lekin inke bich aapasi ekajutata nahin he
 Recently, Arvind Kejriwal, along with 3 of his ministers, had locked themselves in the LG office, accusing LG Anil Baijal of working at the behest of the Center
 congress ne aap ke is andolan kaa samarthan nahin kiya tha
 While Kejriwal got the support of 4 chief ministers Mamata Banerjee, p Vijayan, Chandrababu Naidu and HD Kumaraswamy
 kejariwal ke khilaaf congreshyahan yah baat gaur karne vaala he ki rahul gandhi ke alaava congress ke kai anya netaa kejariwal or aam aadmi party ke bare main kya kehete hai
 Rahul had tweeted a tweet at Kejriwal's dharna in the LG office in which he targeted both Kejriwal and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but did not support the AAP government's agitation against the Center
 congress adhyaksh ke alaavaajay makanne bhi kejariwal ke khilaaf apana hamalaa jari rakhaa or unki aalochana kii
 Former Delhi Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Sheila Dixit also advised Kejriwal, who is sitting on a dharna, that he should read the constitution before doing so
 kejariwal se duuri kyon?aakhir congress kyon kejariwal or aap party se duuri banaae rakhi hui he jabaki usne purajor se bijepi par hamalavar rukh kaayam rakhaa hua he
 Kejriwal, along with Anna Hazare, launched a fierce attack on the Congress and the Gandhi family, starting the Lokpal movement
 kejariwal ko 'angided missile' tak kaha gaya
 The Congress and Sonia Gandhi have not invited Kejriwal to any meeting organized for the attack against the Modi government
 sonia kii tarah rahul ne bhi kejariwal se samaan duuri bana rakhi he
 Sonia and Rahul as well as Kejriwal attended the swearing-in ceremony of Chief Minister Kumaraswamy in Karnataka recently, but there was no meeting between the two
 congress kaa sheersh netritv vipakshi ekajutata ke liye mamata banerjee, mayawati, andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri en chandrababu naidu samet kai anya netaaon ko baatcheet ke liye bula chuki he, lekin unhone na kejariwal ko nyotaa diya or na hi kisi tarah kaa aisa koi prayaas kiya
 For the country's oldest political party, the Aam Aadmi Party still remains 'untouchable'
 dilli main junior partner nahinsutra bataate hai ki congress kaa dilli netritv nahin chahta he ki kejariwal ke saath kisi tarah kaa koi sambandh kaayam kiya jaae
 The Congress feels that the AAP government is losing its base in Delhi
 3 saal pehle vidhansabha chunaav main 70 main se 67 siton par kabja hasil karne vaali aap ko bada nuksaan hone vaala he
 The Congress is trying to get its old vote bank (muslim and Dalit) back in its favor
 congress ko ummid he ki agle chunaav main muslim or dalit use vot karenge
 The next election in Delhi will be held in 2020
 ek khaas baat yah bhi he ki congress agar aap se sampark karti he or uske saath aage badhati he to use dilli main junior partner ke rup main rahanaa padegaa kyonki aap kaa dilli main varchasv he
 The Congress already remains a junior partner in many states
 bihar, jammu-kashmir, karnataka or uttar pradesh main bhi uski sthiti junior partner kii he
 In Uttar Pradesh, if she makes any kind of agreement with SP and BSP, then her role will be that of junior partner
 aagaamee chunaav se badalegi surat!is bich congress ko ummid he ki saal ke ant main rajasthan, madhyapradesh or chhattisgarh main hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav main use phayda ho saktaa he or satta main vaapasi ho sakati he
 The BJP has a government in these three states and may have to face the anti-incumbency wave
 punjab main satta main vaapasi or gujarat main apni sthiti sudhaarney ke baad karnataka main satta main bhagidaar banane vaali congress kaa aatmavishvaas bad gaya he use lagata he ki aane vaale samay main deshvyapee str par uski sthiti main sudhaar aayega
 If the assembly elections in 3 big states before the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 went in favor of the Congress, then it would have increased its confidence in opening a front against the bjp-led NDA and may also be able to unite the opposition groups
 haalanki congress ke lihaaj se is raajnneetik sameekaran main aam aadmi party kahin bhi feet nahin baithti he or yahi kaaran he ki rahul gandhi ke liye kejariwal kii aap party aaj bhi 'achhut' bani hui he
 If there is an intention to do something and it is freshly elevated, then you can write a text that no one has imagined
 rajasthan ke dhaulpur jile main bhi kuch isi tarah kuch karne kii chaah or buland hausalon kii badaulat daang ilaake kii teen mahilaon ne khud kii beemaa company khadi kar 110 gramin mahilaon ke saath-saath hair kwaliphoid yuvakon ko bhi na sirf rojgaar diya he balki aatm nirbhar banakar nari ke ablaa se sabala ban jane kaa sandesh bhi diya he

 The bank refused to insure

 On this, three women of Dang, who had studied till 5th, formed an insurance company named Saheli Relief Fund in 2003 to support the poor cattle farmers
 bina sarkari madad ke chal rahi he muhim
 
 
 The insurance company is headed by Radha Kahar, Vice President Baby Thakur and Treasurer Rajwala
 vartmaan main ye company dhaulpur jile baadi, basedi, saramthura ke daang ilaake ke 85 ganvo main bina kisisarkari madadke kaary kar rahi he
 He is cooperating with Sanjay Sharma in the whole scheme of making relief fund

 Employment is being given to others
 
 
 inhone 60 se adhik mahilaon or purushon ko rojgaar de rakhaa he
 To insure the animals, the company has set up one woman friend in 50 villages
 ye apane mul gaanv main rahakar ek hajaar rupee pratimah par kaary karti hai
 Many women have also been given the responsibility of more than one village nearby
 jiske badale unhentirikt vetanbhi diya jaataa he
 Also, staff are also appointed to keep complete accounts in the company
 vishesh tamzam ke bina di jaati he beemaa raashi
 
 
 This insurance company insures the animal for one year and takes 5% of the estimated price from the cattleman as premium
 saath hi saamaanya jaankaree vaala ek chota sa farm bharwati he
 a photo of the animal spinach is placed on the farm
 pashu ke kaan main company kaa vishesh tareeke kaa tag lagaaya jaataa he
 If the animal dies due to any reason during a year, 75 percent of the animal's price is given to the cattleman in 15 days as a support amount from the company
 pashu ke marane par paalak pashu sakhi ko soochna detaa he
 She reaches the spot and takes a photo of the dead animal from the mobile and sends it to the office through whatsapp
 saamaanya sa farm or pashu sakhi kii report ke aadhaar par hi clem de diya jaataa he
 There is no need to report a doctor etc

 mahanayake amitabh bachchan pichley dinon shatrughna sinha kii kitaab ke launch par mukhya atithi ke rup main pahunche, is maukey par amitabh ne shatrughna ke bare main kai shandaar baaten share kin
 Let's know what Amitabh Bachchan said about his legendary actor Shatrughan: What do you want to say on this special occasion? First of all i want to thank Shatrugh (shatrughan) that he invited me at the launch of the book today Have done aapaki shatrughna sinha semulakatkab hui thi?jab main filmon main kaam karne ke liye main industry main shaamil hone aayaa tab meri shatrughna se mulaakaat hui, un dinon inke paas kaam hota tha or ham nae-nae aaye hue the, us lihaaj seshatrughnamere senior hai, lekin umr main shaayad 4-5 saal chote hai
 What do you know about Shatrughan? His life has been very bizarre and wonderful
 inke parivaar main ram, lakshmana, bharat, shatrughna hai saath hi jab inhone mumbai main ghar kharida to uskaa naam bhi 'ramayana' rakhaa
 Anything special you want to share? There is no such instance in our film industry where applause used to happen when a villain arrived, but whenever Shatrughan Sinha came on screen, there was applause
 ye bahut hi khaas baat hua karti thi
 Shatrughan became a hero after the villain and he also earned a lot of fame as a hero

 supreme court nigaraanee bhi karegaa or sibiai jaanch bhi karegi lekin vyaapman jaise bade maamalon kii jaanch ke liye sibiai main saadhan kii jo kami he, wo ek bada sawaal bani hui he
 The comments kareeb das din pehle sibiai ye maamla apane haath main le chuki he or is ghotaale kii jaanch ke liye usne desh bhar se 40 afasar jutaaye hai
 But despite all the political uproar, the proceedings are slow
 sibiai ke liye philhal chunauti ye he ki wo saare maamalon kii jaanch kar paaegi yaa nahin kyonki vyaapman jaise bade maamle kii jaanch ke liye afasar bhi kam pad rahe hai
 So far, the CBI has registered 13 firs and five primary investigations in this case, including the cases of Namrata Damor and Akshay Singh
 lekin sibiai ke saamne hazaron pannon ke dastauez hai, 350 log is maamle main giraftaar hue hai, saath hi 185 or maamalon kii use jaanch kerani he
 This is 20 per cent work for the CBI, which has filed 1000 cases in an average year
 sibiai iske liye saadhan nahin juta paa rahi he
 Earlier in the Saradha case, the CBI has said in the court that without the help of the local police, this investigation would not be possible
 ho saktaa he, is maamle main bhi shahar ke police kii madad lee jaae
 Call the CBI a parrot cage or a slave of power, it has been the most important investigative agency of the country so far
 shaayad isliye har ghapala uske pehle se baari kandhon par daal diya jaataa he lekin sawaal ye he ki sibiai ke paas jaanch ke saadhan puure na hon to isse batch nikalne kaa rasta bhi ban jaataa he
 The investigation continues, the accused remain free

 ausatan saal main 1000 maamle darj karne vaali sibiai ke liye ye 20 fisadi kaam he
 The CBI is unable to find the means for this
 isse pehle sarada maamle main sibiai adaalat main kah chuki he ki sthaneey police kii madad ke bina ye jaanch nahin ho paaegi
 It is possible that in this case also the help of the city police should be taken
 sibiai ko tote kaa pinjadaa kahen yaa satta kaa ghulaam, ye abhi tak desh kii sabase mahatvapurn jaanch agency rahi he
 Probably, because every scandal is put on his already heavy shoulders, but the question is that if the CBI does not have the means of investigation, then it also becomes an escape route
 jaanch jari rahati he, aaropee azaad rahete hai
 Today is the fifth day of Anna Hazare's fast
 apane anshan ke 5wein din ramlila maidan main samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue anna ne kaha ki unka vajan saadhe teen kilo kam ho chukaa he, lekin vah rukne vaale nahin he
 He again said that the Jan Lokpal Bill will be reached only after reaching its end
 anna ne kaha ki desh ke khajaane ko choronse nahin, balki iskepaharedaaron se bhi khatra he
 Hazare said to his supporters at Ramlila Maidan, "the Republic was formed on January 26, 1950, but the people of the country did not wake up
" ab janata jaag gai he or ham sahi aazaadee lekar rahenge
 Significantly, Hazare started his fast on August 16
 67 ghanton kaa anshan unhone tihaad jail main kiya tha or shuukravaar dopaher se vah ramlila maidan main anshan kar rahe hai
 Hazare, who has given the government the last time till August 30 to pass the Jan Lokpal Bill, said that the issue of Lokpal is a halt and the fight will continue
 naakaabil ummidavaaron ko chunaav main khaarij karne ke paksh main or krishi bhoomi ke sarkari adhigrahan ke khilaaf hamen agali ladaai ladani he
 He said that this government too has been caught in the vicious cycle of corruption
 hamen is kuchakr ko todna he
 The Gandhian activist said that the government treasury is not threatened by thieves, its guards, and the country is threatened by corrupt traitors, not enemies
 unhone kaha ki anshan ke paanchaven din yuvaaon ko dekhakar unhen urja mil rahi he or vah 8-10 din or anshan kar sakate hai
 After Anna Hazare, noted social activist Medha Patkar said that the farmers of the country want land rights, not land acquisition, and the next movement should be on this issue
 isse pehle, team anna ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ki sarkaarajab chaahe, annabaatcheetke liye taiyaar hai
 For three days, Anna went on a hunger strike in Tihar Jail and on Friday, the fourth day afternoon, Anna reached Ramlila Maidan
 anna ke yahaan pahunchane ke baad se hi unke samarthakon kii taadaad lagaataar badhati hi ja rahi he
 Although intermittent rains have been an obstacle many times since Friday evening, the enthusiasm of supporters has not diminished
 puri raat ramlila maidan deshbhakti gaanon kii gunj se garmata rahaa
 The next three days of Anna's fast are very important
 agle teen din chuttee ke hai or aise main ramlila maidan main baari bheed umadane kii sambhaavna he
 The crowd was seen more at night than it was on Friday
 janalokapal par gambhir baaten to huin hi, vahiin vahaan maujuud hajaaron log deshbhakti gaanon par jhum rahe the
 It stopped raining intermittently, but people persevered
 bheed badhati rahi, barish ke baavjood logon kaa josh thanda nahin hua
 Anna again said that he expected the youth, the country has become aware
 team anna ke sadsy arvind kejariwal bhi bole
 Kejriwal called the central government as deaf government
 prashanth bhushan ne lokapal ke mudde par janamat sangrah kii baat kahi
 How long will this fast last? How long will Anna's body support her intentions? He has lost 4 kilos, but Anna is carefree
 kehete hai jab vajan 10 kilo kam ho jaae, tab baat karnaa
 But now everyone's eyes are really on whether Anna will be able to fast for 15 days
 anna kaa apana daawa he ki 15 din ke baad ek hafte or vah anshan par rah sakate hai
 (also from input agencies) bollywood celibrities apane posts ko lekar kai baar trobers ke nishane par aa chuke hai

 When we throw something up, why does it come down
 kabhi sochaa he aapane is bare main
 The force of gravity pulls that thing down
 to aakhir yah gurutvkarshan he kya? yah kaise paidaa hota he? isi tarah ke rochak sawaalon ko jaanane ke liye padhate he gurutvkarshan ke bare main:newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam (newton's law of gravitation):kinhin do pindo ke bich kaary karne vaala aakarshan bal pindo ke dravyamanon ke gunanfal ke anukramanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg ke vyutkramanupati hota he
 Suppose two bodies with mass m1 and m2 are located at a distance r from each other, then according to Newton's law, the attraction force between them is f = g m1m2 / r ^ 2
 jahaan g ek niyatank he, jise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan niyatank kehete hai or jiskaa maan 6
 67 x 10 ^ -11 Nm ^ 2 / kg ^ 2
 gurutv (gravity):newton ke gurutvkarshan ke anusaar do pindo ke bich ek aakarshan bal kaary karata he
 If one of these bodies is earth, then this attraction force is called gravity
 yani ki, gurutv vah aakarshan bal he, jisase prithvi kisi vastu ko apane centre kii ore khinchati he
 The acceleration generated due to this force is called gravitational acceleration (g), whose value is 9
 8 m / s^2 hota he
 Gravitational acceleration (g) does not depend on the form, shape, mass, etc
 of the object
 g ke maan main parivartan:i)prithvi kii sataha se upar yaa neeche jane par g kaa maan ghatata he
 ii) The value of 'g' is at the pole of the maximum earth
 iii) 'g' kaa maan nunatam vishuvat rekha (equator) par hota he
 iv) The value of 'g' decreases as the Earth's rotation speed increases
 v)prithvi kii ghurnan gati ghatane par 'g' kaa maan bad jaataa he
 Note: If the Earth rotates at 17 times its current angular speed, then the weight of the object placed on the equator will be zero
 lift main pind kaa bhaar (weight of a body in lift):i)jab lift upar kii ore jaati he to lift main sthit pind kaa bhaar badha hua prathit hota he
 ii) When the lift moves down, the weight of the body in the lift appears to be reduced
 iii)jab lift ek samaan veg se upar yaa neeche gati karti he, to lift main sthit pind ke bhaar main koi parivartan prathit nahi hota
 iv) If the lift chord breaks down while descending, it falls down like a free body
 aisi sthiti main lift main sthit pind kaa bhaar shunya hota he
 This is a state of weightlessness
 v)yadi neeche utarate samay lift kaa twaran gurutveey twaran se adhik ho to lift main sthit pind uski farsh se uthakar uski chat se ja lagegaa
 Kepler's law related to planetary motion: i) Each planet revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit and the Sun is positioned at a focus point of the planet's orbit
 ii)prayek grah kaa kshetreey veg (areal velocity) niyat rahata he
 The effect is that when the planet is near the Sun, its velocity increases and when it is away, its velocity decreases
 iii)surya ke chaaron ore grah ek chakkar jitne samay main lagaataa he, use uskaa parikraman kaal (T) kehete he
 The square (T ^ 2) of the revolving period is inversely proportional to the cube (r ^ 3) of the planet's average distance from the Sun (r)
 yani ki T^2 ∝ r^3yani ki surya se adhik dur ke grahon kaa parikraman kaal bhi adhik hota he
 Example: The closest period to the Sun is the rotation period of Mercury 88 days, while that of the distant planet Varuna (neptune) has a rotation period of 165 years
 note:ieyu (I
 A
 U
 ) Has removed Yama (PLUTO) from the planetary category, so the distant planet is now Varuna
 upgrah (satellite):kisi grah ke chaaron ore parikrama karne vaale pind ko us grah kaa upgrah kehete hai
 Like the moon is a satellite of the earth
 upgrah kii kakshiya chaal (orbital speed of satellite):i)upgrah kii kakshiya chaal uski prithvi tal se unchai par nirbhar karti he
 The farther away the satellite is from the earth, the lower its movement
 ii)upgrah kii kakshiya chaal uske dravyaman par nirbhar nahin karti he
 Satellites of different masses in the same radius orbit will have the same speed
 note:prithvi tal ke ati nikat chakkar lagane vaale upgrah kii kakshiya chaal lagbhag 8 kimi
 / Sec
 upgrah kaa parikraman kaal (orbital speed of a satellite): upgrah apni kaksha main prithvi kaa ek chakkar jitne samay main lagaataa he, use uskaa parikraman kaal kehete haiytah parikraman kaal = kaksha kii paridhi / kakshiya chaalani)upgrah kaa parikraman kaal bhi keval uski prithvi tal se oonchai par nirbhar karata he or upgrah jitna dur hoga utana hi adhik uskaa parikraman kaal hota he
 ii) The rotation period of a satellite does not depend on its mass
 note:prithvi ke ati nikat chakkar lagane vaale upgrah par parikraman kaal 1 ghanta 24 minute hota he
 Geo-stationary satellite: a satellite that orbits the Earth from west to east in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the Earth and whose rotation period is equal to the Earth's rotation period (24 hours)
 It is called permanent satellite
 yah upgrah prithvi tal se lagbhag 36000 kimi
 Revolves the earth by staying at a height of
 bhu-tulykaalik (geosynchronous) kaksha main sanchaar upgrah sthapit karne kii sambhaavna sabase pehle other si clark ne vyakt kii thi
 Escape velocity: The escape velocity is the minimum velocity by which a body, when thrown above the Earth's surface, crosses the gravitational field, does not return to Earth
 prithvi ke liye palaayan veg kaa maan 11
 2 km / s means that something 11 from the earth plane
 2 km / s yaa usase adhik veg se upar kisi bhi disha main phenk diya jaae to vastu phir prithvi tal par vaapis nahin aegi
 The orbital velocity for the satellite is Vo = √gre and the escape velocity from the Earth plane is Ve = √2gre 'so Ve = √2vo means that if the migration velocity is increased by √2 (ie 41%) of the orbital velocity, that satellite will leave its orbit Will flee

 When the mortal remains of the captain reached the village, people gathered up to bid their last farewell

 bete ke parthiv sharir ko dekhakar maa or bahan kaa ro-ro kar bura haal ho gaya
 Still, he was saying that the son gave his life while serving the country
 uski is qurbaani par puure parivaar ko garv he
 During this time, Kapil's sister fainted after seeing her brother's body
 'zindagi lambii nahin, badi honi chahie'23 saal se bhi kam umr main desh ke liye sarvocch balidaan dene vaale captain kapil kundu kaa maananaa tha ki jindagi lambii nahin badi honi chahie

 unka fasebuk states tha, ‘jindagi lambii nahin, badi honi chahie
 'captain really lived a big life in 23 years

 dilli main chikangunia kaa badhata asar dekh kar prashasan ne machhar maarane kii dawa ke chhidkaav or saafe safai kaa kaam or bade paimaane par karne kaa daawa kiya
 But people of many areas of Delhi say that these claims are only on paper
 chikangunia se shahar ke halaat bigade hue hai
 Qwanson claims that the sprinkling of medicine is being done with Zoro noise, but the ground reality is different from this claim
 majanu kaa tila or trilokapuri kii jeje colony jaise ilaakon main rahane vaale logon kaa kahana he ki unke ilaakon main kisi tarah kaa koi dawa chhidkaav yaa anya saafe safaai prashasan kii ore se nahin kii jaati
 The comments jhuggi jhopadiyaan or madhya stareey rihaayshi ilaake to hameshaa se hi sarkari andekhi kii maar jhelte rahe hai lekin is saal dilli ke posh ilaake bhi is andekhi se batch nahin paye hai
 People of those areas say that the work of spraying medicine is done only on paper
 dakshin dilli kii rahanevaali minu gupta kaa kahana he ki unke ilaake main machhar maarane kii dawa kaa chhidkaav karne koi nahin aata, ilaake ke kai log biimaar bhi hai
 So far, 4 deaths have been reported from Chikungunya in Delhi, more than 1000 cases have been reported
 aise halaat main sabase zaruri kadam machhar maarane kii dawa ke chhidakane kaa hi sahi dhang se na hona halaat or karaab kar saktaa he
 Chikungunya has worsened the situation in the city
 prashnasana kaa daawa he ki dawa chhidakane kaa kaam zoro shoron se kiya ja rahaa he, lekin jamini haqiqat is daawey se alag he
 People living in areas such as Majnu Ka Tila and JJ Colony of Trilokpuri say that no drug spraying or other cleaning is done by the administration in their areas
 tippaniyan Slum slums and mid-level residential areas have always been facing governmental neglect, but this year even posh areas of Delhi have not been able to escape from this neglect
 un ilaaqon ke logon kaa kahana he ki dawa chhidakane kaa kaam yahaan sirf kaagajon par hi hota he
 Meenu Gupta, who lives in South Delhi, says that no one comes to her area to spray mosquito repellent, many people in the area are also sick
 chikangunia se ab tak dilli main 4 mautein ho chuki hai, 1000 se zyaada maamle saamne aa chuke hai
 In such a situation, the most important step is that the sprinkling of mosquito repellent is not done correctly and can make the situation worse
 jhuggi jhopadiyaan or madhya stareey rihaayshi ilaake to hameshaa se hi sarkari andekhi kii maar jhelte rahe hai lekin is saal dilli ke posh ilaake bhi is andekhi se batch nahin paye hai

 commercial cinema se hatakar paariwarik rishte par aadhaarit 'berfoot tu goa' kai rashtriya or antarrashtriya film samarohon se guzarakar akhirkaar bharat main release ho rahi he
 Produced two years ago, the film received help from 238 people from about 15 countries
 nirdeshak praveen morchhaale kii maane to kareeb 50 lakh kii madad unhen mil chuki he or tab kahin jaakar film kii release kaa rasta saafe hua
 Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan too recently praised 'barefoot to Goa'
 to ek taraf jahaan film ko khub saraahaa ja rahaa he, vahiin film main beete vakt ke mashhoor gayak yesuudas kaa gaanaa bhi charchaa main he
 With this song, Yesudas is making a comeback to film music after 20 years
 rishton kii uljhan or parivaar ke bich utaar-chadhaav kii baarikiyaan darshaati 'berfoot tu goa' 10 april yani isi shuukravaar ko release ho rahi he
 'barefoot to Goa' is being released on 40 screens in 11 cities
 is lekh kaa sheershak shaayad do tareeke se tay ho saktaa he
 First: Yes, i met Dawood and i am not a terrorist
 or doosraa: main ek adad patrkaar hum, or meraa naam vaidic nahin he
 Now let's deal with these two in turn
 pehle vaale sheershak par baat karne ke liye puraa khulaasa karnaa hoga
 Like, i met Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale one and a half dozen times
 main laladenga, muiva, gulbuddin hikmatyar, kaaji hossain ahamed, general mirza asalam beg (pakistan kii jamaate islamic ke tatkaaleen amir or phir fouj ke mukhiya) se mila hum
 Since this is my confession, let me also state that i went to a demonstration with Mohammad tahir-ul-qadri (infamous for occupying Islamabad) in a truck where the Klassnikov rifle around us was waved in the air
 She was main vilupillai prabhakaran se bhi mila hum, iesai ke do pramukhon se bhi maine baat kii he or meri kismat itani acchhee thi ki geneva ke ek hotel kii lift main meri mulaakaat ek pratishthit or majboot dehaishti vaale sootbootadhari sajjan se ho gai jinaki shakhsiyat par maano faujee likhaa tha par naak par pataudi
 He was Major General Af Sandayar Pataudi, cousin of our own Tiger Pataudi and uncle of Saif Ali Khan, who used to be second in the ISI at the time
 ab aajkal jis kism kaa 'deshbhakti’ bharaa maahaul hamaare yahaan he, usamen main apane in dussahason kii safai bhala kaise detaa? or meri 'kaayarta’ dekhie ki us maukey kaa paryaapt phayda bhi nahin uthaa paaya? to ab main bhala kya karata? kya main bhindranvaale ke kisi khadku se eke rifl chin kar use goli maar detaa yaa phir use logon ko saunp detaa?yaa phir muiva or laladenga ko vafaadaar bharatiyon main tabdeel kar detaa yaa sani deol kii tarah apane haathon se hi unki gardanen marod detaa? or tab kya mujhase yah ummid kii jaati ki main hatyare mujahidin commander se mulaakaat ko thukraa duun or antat: geneva kii lift main hui us auchak mulaakaat ke baad sarkaar main isaki soochna kahin darj karaun? lekin isaki soochna main kahaan darj karaun? apni sarkaar main main kise report karun? main to apane pathakon ko report karata hum
 As much as i know scholars like Vedic (not necessarily in my eyes, but they probably think of themselves as such), it is more likely that they will not be able to afford the sudden fame
 is prakriya main haalanki hamaari samuhik nirnay kshamta bauddhik diwaliyapan kaa shikaar ho chuki he jisane hamen ek sanakee, vivekahin, dakiyanoos, agyani, aparipakv yaa sidhe kahen to ek murkh raashtra ke rup main ujagar kar daalaa he
 i am also aware of the risk involved in saying so because the meeting of Vedapratap Vedic and Hafiz Saeed has been going on in front of us all week, even in Parliament
 yah prasang bataata he ki hamaare desh main log kitne khaali hai
 This is the one that has been the most foolish subject in all the redundant disputes that have been used to fuel the fires of the channels' prime time warriors
 ek patrkaar kii ek aatankwaadi se mulaakaat ne hamen hairat main daal diya he
 Serious questions are being raised
 jaise, kya bhartiya ucchayog ne is mulaakaat kaa intjaam kiya tha? yadi aisa vastav main tha, to phi r hamaara bhartiya ucchayukta aaj tak kaa sabase zyada pahunch vaala rajanyik hona chahie, basharte said bhi do baar ro kaa agent rah chukaa ho
 However, what did Vedic talk to Saeed? If you know Vedic, you can say that he probably did not talk
 bahut sambhav he ki unhone mulaakaat kaa sara vakt yah bataane main hi bitaa diya ho ki ve kaise ek swayambhu or pratishthit rajanyik or shantidoot hai or yah ki unhone benazir bhutto, asif ali jaradaari, navaj sharif, hamid karaji, rajeev gandhi, pi
 V
 narsingh raav or atal bihari vaajapeyi se kya-kya kaha tha or kaise baraak obama ne shaayad unke saamne sweekaarokti kii hogi ki vaidic ji, kaash! main aapaki salaah maan letaa to
 
 
 
 vaidic ke puraane saakshaatkaar chalaae ja rahe hai jisamen ve kashmir kii aazaadee samet uske liye inkulabi kism ke nuskhe bayaan kar rahe hai
 So did Vedic compromise India's interests? Did they return and brief the officials about this? Did he freeze Muridke's GPS coordinates on his smartphone? Did he offer Saeed to Kashmir? All i would say is that if he had really done so, Saeed would have accepted his offer with thanks and was arguing in front of his loyalists to celebrate the victory: return to the barracks , Brother Vedicji has given us the gift of Kashmir
 or phir jahaan tak meraa khyal he, vah hamaare kandhon se utar jayega, balki hamaare halak main se hi nikal jayega
 You know that i am not saying all this very seriously
 lekin jaisaa atirecopurna deshbhakti kaa maahaul is desh main bana hua he, ki trent brij kii sidhippon par 'lord’ ravinder jadeja ko dhakelne par angrej tej gendbaaj jimi anderson achaanak bharat kaa dushman number van ban jaataa ho, jahaan hamaara samoochaa hasyabodh kapil sharma ke kamedi nits or navjot singh ke siddhuism ke daayre main simat gaya ho, to behatar yahi he ki har cheez ko moorkhtaaon se bachaakar rakhaa jaae
 After all, you do not want to be the star of the prime time or the topic of breaking news the next night, saying that the offer of Kashmir to an editor, Vedic's Saeed is fine, at least on the pretext that Saeed will miss us
 haa, meraa aashay philhal yah nahin he
 However i did the same thing once in a tense atmosphere created after 26 / 11, a Pakistani TV anchor taunted me over a phone interview asking me that Arundhati Roy has already said that Kashmir should be given to Pakistan
 If you want to, then tab maine apana peechha chhudaane ke liye puri gambhirtha se kaha tha ki agar aisa hi he to kashmir unheen se le lijie kyonki jaahir he, ve mujhase zyada pratishthit or acchhee lekhika to hai hi
 i had escaped by saying this
 phir bhi, is hafte kii bahes ko kahin-na-kahin to gambhir mode par laakar chhodia hi hoga
 a journalist has every right to interview anyone he wants to meet, even talk off the record with him
 agar mark majeti (neuyork times kaa reporter jisane afghanistan-pakistan main siie ke 'kaale’ abhiyaanon par sabase badhibia shodhaparak pustak da ve of da nif likhi) osama kaa intervyuu le pate, to ve america main khalanaayak nahin hote, balki vahaan ke bade nayak hote
 Peter Bergen actually met Osama in 1997 and after that he became an expert in everything related to Osama
 dashakon pehle jab itulla khumaini america ke taaja-taaja dushman number van bane the, tab oriyana pha laachi unka saakshaatkaar lekar duniyabar ke media main achaanak chamak gai thim
 Nobody told them to keep Khomeini in their custody until the American hostages were released
 bharat main saarvajanik vimarsh ke is patan ko ab to 15 baras hone ko aa rahe hai, shaayad kargil ke baad se hi yah sab shuru hua tha jab ham patrakaron ko 'force multiplir’ kahkar phulayaa gaya or ham satta ke aise pramaan-patron kaa sukh lene lage
 The reverberation was once again heard in 2001 when nationalist attacks were carried out on the editors (including me) who politely ate breakfast with Pervez Musharraf in Agra, while rejecting India's favor over Kashmir
 hamane na to virodh kiya or na hi ham apni rashtrabhakti ko sabit karne ke liye uskaa bahishkaar hi kar sake
 Instead of defending our right to listen to the views of the President of Pakistan, many of us have cowardly distanced ourselves from the matter
 main haalanki tab bhi chup nahin rahaa
 Last year, in what could perhaps be called his first election speech, Narendra Modi again attacked Indian journalists at a Delhi rally on 29 September, why they could not resist leaving food in New York when Nawaz Sharif was our Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was reportedly calling her a "pastoral woman"
 thik he, modi ke liye to vah chunavi muhaavarebaaji thi lekin ham patrakaron ne to apane sunne, sawaal poochne, story laane ke adhikaar ke samarthan main kahaan kuch kaha? ham kahaan kah sake ki hamaara kaam rajanyikon yaa phogiyon kii tarah jang laduya nahin he? is baar fark bas itnaa he ki juute vahi hai, bas pair badal gaye hai kyonki vaidic, sangh parivaar ke kareebi hai
 Here we can talk on another possible title of this article: that i am a very journalist, and my name is not Vedic
 main yah baat isliye kah rahaa hum ki ek adad patrkaar ko kisi ke saath milane, baat karne, khaane kii jo riyaayat mili hoti he, phir chaahe vah desh kaa sabase khatarnaak dushman hi kyon na ho, vah riyaayat aapako usee tarah apane aap nahin mil jaati, yadi aapkaa naam vaidic he
 This is because for a long time if Vedic leaders are not there, then at least there are political pendants, who sometimes appear as ideological commissars, often in the garb of self-proclaimed ambassadors of India and of course, they are the middlemen of Baba Ramdev and There are spokespersons
 unki sabase badi uplabdhi yah rahi he ki unhone pranab mukherjee jaise kaddavar netaa se baat karke unhen dilli hawaii adde par ramdev ke charnon main lotane ke liye chaar cabinet mantriyon ko bhejne ke liye raji kar liya tha
 i believe that this single cowardly act had uprooted upa-2's remaining credibility by that time
 yahi vaidic kii jindagi kaa sabase bada schoop tha, lekin af sos ki ve patrkaar ke chole main nahin the
 Post-script: i have been proudly counting Vedic as a regular and intelligent reader of 'national Interest' and have often been calling me to appreciate or disagree, which has been an honor for me
 maine anna andolan kii aalochana main kuch likhaa tha
 Vedic was his supporter at that time
 ek subah unhone phone kiya or kuch aise bole ki arvind (kejariwal) to acha baccha he lekin ye ladki kiran (bedi) abhi kuch ziddee or aparipakv he
 i said, "kiran Bedi is called a little girl, Vedic sir
 
 
 wo to aapse kuch saal hi choti hongi
 "they said," Oh brother, you are right
 
 
 lekin maine to pachaas ke aage se hi sanyas le liya, desh kii seva ke liye
 In short, he said that on the day he turned 50, he had decided to renounce all worldly fascination and become a political politician to serve the nation
 yahaan tak ki unhone sex ko bhi tyaag diya
 All types of sex
 or yah rashtraseva unhen itnaa santosh detii rahi he ki unhen kabhi bhi phir koi laalasaa nahin hui
 i asked in surprise, "never craved after fifty sir?" He said proudly, "no, never
 or kya aap jaanate hai, ki har kism kii aakarshak auraten mujhse milti hai, mere ghar par rahati hai or ve mujhe aakrisht karnaa chaahati hai, jaise miss america, miss brazil
 
 
 ? "I said," Vedic sir, i am fascinated by your loyalty and self-denial to celibacy but would you like to test your patience against the charm of Miss Brazil? "vedic said without any seriousness," Of course , Why not
 ”vaidic ji beshak khud ko kaaphi gambhirtha se lete hai

 kendriya mantri smriti irani kaa peechha karne ke maamle main dilli police ne chaaron aropiyon ke khilaaf aaj court main chargeshit daakhil kii he
 Let it be known that the four accused are students of Delhi University
 dilli police ne chaaron aropiyon ke khilaaf daakhil chargeshit main ipisi kii dhaaraon 354 di, 509 or motor vical act kii dhara 185 ke tahat cese darj kiye hai
 Police today filed a chargesheet in the Patiala House Court, on which the court has also taken cognizance
 ab court is maamle main agali sunwaayee 15 oktober ko karegi
 The police has told in its charge sheet how the accused were constantly chasing Smriti Irani
 police ne apnichargeshitmen irani ke bayaan or ghatana kaa zikr kiya he
 The incident of being chased by a well-known actress and union minister in the capital had shocked everyone, as well as raising questions about the safety of ordinary women in the capital
 bataa den kii yah ghatana pichley saal ek april kii he
 According to the chargesheet, on the night of April 1, 2017, four DU students not only chased Smriti Irani's car while intoxicated, but also made obscene gestures
 jaanch main pataa chalaa ki ghatana vaale din shaam kareeb 5 baje smriti irani IGI airport se sarkari car main tughlaq road kriscent sthit sarkari nivas ja rahi thim
 Four youths from a Myanmar embassy in a Haryana number car started chasing them
 aaropee lagaataar unhen ashleel ishaare bhi kar rahe the
 Smriti Irani asked her driver and security personnel to stop the car of the accused
 smriti irani ke driver nefrancisi duutavasake paas aropiyon kii car roak lee or 100 number par dilli police control room ko kol kar diya
 a PCR van immediately rushed to the spot and the four accused were nabbed
 poochtacha main aropiyon anand sharma, kunal, avinaash va shitanshu ne bataaya ki ve DU ke chaatr hai or dakshin dilli ke vasant gaanv ke rahane vaale hai
 At the time of the incident, the four were returning to attend a friend's birthday party
 bhartiya vayusena kaa een-32 vimaan somvaar ko assam se udaan bharne ke 35 minute baad laapata ho gaya
 There were 13 people aboard the plane and it was heading towards Arunachal Pradesh
 is vimaan se transport kaa kaam liya ja rahaa tha jo arunachal ke mechuka main advance landing ground ke liye niklaa tha
 Mechuka is a small town in the Siang district of Arunachal, adjoining China
 ise khojane ke liye kai atyaadhunik vimaan lage hai
 Even ISRO has come forward but the Air Force has not been able to find any clue so far
 teen saal pehle 2016 main bhi isi bede kaa ek vimaan (een-32) bengal kii khadi ke upar laapata ho gaya tha
 Even in his search, every effort was made to do whatever the army could do, but regret that its debris has not been found yet
 tab sawaal yah uthta he ki 2016 kii ghatana bengal kii khadi kii thi jahaan apaar jalarashi main kisi vimaan ke lupt hone kii ashanka ho sakati he lekin kal kaa maamla arunachal kaa he jahaan na to koi samudri khadi he or na hi apaar jalarashi
 Then when the plane crashed, where did its debris go? Right now the churning continues on this question
 is bich ek jaankaree yah saamne ai ki laapata vimaan apgrade nahin tha
 That is, his software was running on the same old technology as the technology he got while purchasing
 aise main yah ashanka prabal ho gai he ki takanic kii gadabadi se vimaan kahin apana rasta to nahin bhatak gaya? use janaa tha arunachal lekin kahin or to nahin nikal gaya? baharhaal sena in gutthiyon ko sulajhane main lagi he or yah maan kar chalanaa chahie ki jab tak vimaan kaa malba na mil jaae, tab tak use krash kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 When the question of upgrading will be solved and in this hour of misery, it is not right to raise the question of upgrading, but people eagerly want to know whether the AN-32, which has done many tricks in the history of air transport, has become a victim of upgrades and technology? The figures say something similar
 een-32 vimaanon ke bede ko 1980 main rus (tab kaa soviet union) se kharida gaya tha
 It has a total of 105 aircraft
 is saude main yah bhi darj tha ki rus hi isaki technology ko apgrade karegaa
 The aircraft continued to fly until 2009 but in the same year India put forward a plan with Russia for the upgrade of the AN-32
 naam nahin chhapane kii shart par ek raksha visheshgy ne bataaya ki bharat-rus ke bich 400 million dollar kaa qaraar hua tha
 Under this, Russia had to upgrade the planes, which would increase their flying capacity by 40 years
 us qaraar main 46 vimaanon kii technology kaa apgredation bhi hua magar adhikansh vimaan yun hi rah gaye
 The AN-32 aircraft which went missing at Jorhat in Assam was also not upgraded
 rus or ukraine kaa fansaa penchasawaal he ki 46 vimaan agar apgrade hue to baaki kyon isse vanchit rah gaye? aisa isliye hua kyonki soviet union ke tuutane se rus kaa bantwaaraa hua or apgredation kaa jimmaa ukraine ke hisse chalaa gaya
 There is also information in the media somewhere that the spare parts of AN-32 are with Russia while its design technology is with Ukraine
 ab bharat ke saamne yaksha prashn yah khadaa hua ki vah rus ke saath jaae yaa ukraine ke saath
 India's work was spoiled in the enmity between these two countries
 udhar rus-ukraine ek duusare se jujhate rahe or idhar een-32 apgredation kii baat johta rahaa
 This sequence continues almost till now
 apadation kaa maamla sulajhaa'da hindu' kii ek report bataati he ki een-32 ke apgredation kaa maamla lagbhag sulajhaa liya gaya he
 The head of the Antonov State Corporation, based in Ukraine, informed 'the Hindu'
 een-32 vimaan antonov company hi banaati he
 According to Antonov President Alexander Donets, Ukraine will supply all parts of AN-32 to India in the next 2 years
 ab ye bharat par nirbhar karata he ki vah vimaanon kaa apgredation kitni teji se kar paata he
 Ukraine has also proposed a fleet of AN-132 aircraft to India in place of AN-32 aircraft

 abhiyojak ujjwal nikam ne kasaab ko di gai maut kii sajaa ko nyaaysangat tehraate hue kaha tha ki ye hamale lashkar kii sajeesh kaa parinaam hai
 In his appeal, Kasab argued that the police made a fake encounter at Girgaum Chowpatty to implicate him in the conspiracy of the crime
 usne hamalon ke dauraan maharashtra aties pramukh hemanth karkare, police adhikari ashok kamte or muthbhed visheshgy vijay salskar kii hatya ke aaropon ko bhi nakaar diya
 Kasab appeared in the High Court on some occasions through video conferencing

 trump se mulaakaat ke liye imran khan pakistani army chif qamar javed bajva or iesai chif aseem munir ke saath america daure par pahunche hai
 This is the first time in the history of Pakistan when the two Prime Ministers have gone to the White House with the Prime Minister there
 isse andaja lagata he ki aatankwaad ko lekar duniya main alag-thalag padataa pakistan apana aarthik sankat kam karne ke liye kitni bechaini main he
 Since the US military's help has stopped, Pakistan is also facing economic crisis inside its own country and the possibility of getting the situation out now is ending
 videshi mudra khatm hone kii ore he, pakistani rupee kii haalat aitihaasik rup se nichle str par he
 Pakistan is becoming diplomatically isolated in the world due to India's campaign on terrorism
 is haalat main ab pakistan ko phir apane puraane aakaa america se madad kii ummid he
 In such a situation, the world is looking at what the new Pakistan of Imran, who has been in the state of Bengali, wants from America
 Especially these 5 issues where Pakistan's work does not seem to be going on without trump and America's generosity despite the help of China
 1
 Pakistan, which has become synonymous with terrorism from FATF to Dardunia, is scared about the FATF ban
 oktober main FATF yani financial ection task force kii baithak honi he jisamen pakistan ko grey list se blike list main daalane kaa faisla hona he
 Pakistan was put on the gray list in March and was given 27 targets by the FATF to stop terrorist aid
 june main hui baithak main pakistan kii ore se uthaae gaye kadamon ko naakaafi bataaya gaya
 Due to which there is an increased risk of Pakistan being blacklisted in October
 agar efeetief blaclist kar detaa he to antarrashtriya madad bade paimaane par pakistan ko milani band ho jaaegi
 This will increase the risk of bankruptcy on Pakistan, which is facing economic crisis
 imran khan aatankiyon ko madad rokane kaa bharosa dekar america kaa gussa kam kar efeetief main raahat kii ummid karenge
 The chiefs of both will also accompany Imran on a visit to the US to assure the Pakistani army and the ISI to stop helping the terrorists
 daure se pehle aatanki hafiz said kii giraftaar america ko yahi sanket dene ke liye pakistan ne kii
 2
 IMF or world bank se belout par chahie narmamerica sakhti ke kaaran IMF or world bank se belout milanaa pakistan ke liye mushkil ho gaya he
 Pakistan's deteriorating economic condition is the biggest reason behind its plea to improve relations with the US
 pakistani rupee kii keemat bhi 1 dollar ke mukaable 159 rupee tak gir gai he jo ki aitihaasik rup se nichalaa str he
 The rate of inflation in the country is that the price of one liter of milk has reached 150
 pakistan ke paas vartmaan main 8 arab dollar se bhi kam kaa videshi mudra bhandar he jo uske maatr 1
 7 months is enough to import
 pakistan ke bajet kaa 30 pratishat to sirf karj chukaane main chalaa jaataa he
 Even after this, he has to take more loan to repay the loan
 pakistan ne haal hi main imef se 6 billian dollar kaa belout package liya he lekin iske liye uske saamne kadi sharten rakhi gai hai
 3
 america sainya madad behaal karaane kii chunautijanvari 2018 main donald trump ne twit kiya tha- "america ne pichley 15 saal main pakistan ko 33 billian dollar se adhik kii madad dekar bevakoofi kii
 They gave us nothing but lying and cheating on us
 unki najar main hamaare netaa murkh hai
 The terrorists whom we keep searching in Afghanistan provide them safe haven
 "iske baad america ne pakistan ko di jane vaali suraksha madad main 2 billian dollar kii katautee kii
 The cut also included $ 300 million in military aid
 ab bhi pakistan ke liye sanket achche nahin hai
 a report from the US Congress has come out just before Imran Khan's visit to America
 iske mutabik, jab tak pakistan aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke khilaaf koi thos karrwai nahin kar letaa he tab tak america kii ore se milane vaali aarthik madad suspend hi rahegi
 However, Pakistan has high expectations from its Afghanistan card
 afghanistan se america sainikon kii shantipurna vaapasi main madad or taliban ko vaarta ke teble par laane ke badale pakistan america se band hui sainya madad phir behaal karana chahega
 4
 afghanistan ko lekar donon deshon kii apekshaecamerica prashasan ke liye afghanistan or aatankwaad do pramukh chintaaen hai jiskaa ek sira pakistan se judata he
 America is going to withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan
 iske baad shanti ke halaat bane rahen iske liye taliban se bhi baatcheet chal rahi he
 Pakistan is an important party in this
 trump prashasan ye bhi jaanata he ki pakistan main agar kuch lagu karana he to sarkaar ke saath-saath sainya netritv ko bhi bharose main liye bina uskaa koi matlab nahin he
 For this reason, Pakistan's military rulers are also with Imran on the US tour
 5
 Building trust in the Chinese camp, broken by Pakistan's departure, how much the US trusts in Pakistan, which has gone to the Chinese camp in recent years and has been infamous for helping terrorists, will also be seen
 imran se pehle navaj sharif bhi 2013 or 2015 main america ke daure par gaye the
 But could not build trust in America's eyes
 ab pakistan ko nae piem imran khan kii trump se mulaakaat ko lekar kaaphi ummiden hai
 However, alerts from Chinese incursions into Pakistan through the CPEC project will also keep an eye on how much the US trusts Pakistan and what is its stand on India's concerns

 Defeats in Melbourne and Brisbane have disappointed the team India's fancy
 malebern cricket ground or bristben ke gaba ke match ke nateezon ke baad kai fans to abhi se hi team ke world cap ke nateezon ko lekar sawaal uthaane lage hai, lekin in maichon ko team kii world cap kii taiyaari kaa hissaa maane to kuch aisa bhi he jo team se ummiden jagaata he
 Fans might not remember Stuart Binny's innings in the ODI against England in Brisbane for a long time, as Team India suffered a crushing defeat in this match
 lekin binni or unke samarthak ise isliye yaad karenge ki wo match main team india ke behtareen khilaadi sabit hue
 Coach Duncan Fletcher has been insisting that in these conditions the team needs a batting all rounder who can also bowl moderately fast
 unke mutabik aisa khilaadi team kii batting to majboot karegaa hi or saath hi extra gendbaaz banakar team kii taaqat bhi badha saktaa he
 Binny has survived both these roles in Brisbane
 yah iklauta match unki kaabiliyat kaa saboot nahin mana ja saktaa naa hi unhen team kii zaruuraton kaa sateek jawaab mana ja saktaa he, lekin bristben main stuart binni ne sabase zyaada 44 ran banaae or team india kii ore se iklauta wicket bhi unhen hi mila
 Experts like former Test cricketers Madan Lal and Sunil Joshi have been saying that it depends on the captain of the team how they use Binny
 captain dhoni ne unhen saatven number par aazamaaya to unhone team ko maayoos nahin kiya or gendbaazi ke dauraan bhi unhone apni ahmiyat sabit kii
 Captain MS Dhoni says, "we have to see how we make best use of them
" wo aise gendbaaz jarur hai jo swing kara sakate hai
 From the next matches of the tournament it will be clear how they use the new ball and this will give us a good option
 ' To succeed in the World Cup, Team India needs a great all-rounder who fits into every role for Team India's multi tasking
 shaayad binni aise khilaadi banakar ubhar sakate hai
 Despite the team's defeat, Binny's performance can be a relief for captain Dhoni and team management as the team is getting a better option for further planning
 zaahir he binni aage bhi aise hi mauqon kii talash main rahenge or team or phans unase lagaataar behatar pradarshan kii ummid karte rahenge

 Amid the accusations of Western countries to develop nuclear weapons on Iran, the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamani on Thursday asserted that his country does not want to make nuclear weapons, but does not 'own' the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes

 unhone duniya ke aise deshon (pashchimi desh) kii aalochana bhi kii, jo parmaanu praudyogiki ko apane aap tak simit rakhana chaahate hai
 Inaugurating the 16th summit of the non-aligned Movement, Khamenei lashed out at the US
 unhone kaha ki america duniya par dhauns jamaane ke liye sanyukt raashtra kaa durupyog kar rahaa he
 He said, "the Islamic Republic of Iran opposes the use of nuclear and chemical weapons and sees it as an unpardonable sin
 hamane madhya-purv ko parmaanu hathiyaar mukt banane kaa naaraa diya he or ham iske prati patibaddh hai
 " khamnei ne kaha, "lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki iran shantipurna uddeshyon ke liye parmaanu urja ke istemaal kaa apana haq chhod degaa
 According to international regulations, the use of civil nuclear technology is right for all countries of the world
 har kisi ko apane desh ke liye vibhinn uddeshyon ke sandarbh main is surakshit urja ke istemaal kaa adhikaar milanaa chahie
 " unhone kaha ki kuch pashchimi deshon ke paas parmaanu hathiyaar hai, lekin ve parmaanu eendhan utpaadit karne kii kshamta ko apane aap tak simit kar lenaa chaahate hai
 He said, "its biggest irony is the US administration, which has the most and most lethal nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, is the only country committed to its use
" lekin aaj vahi parmaanu prasar ke khilaaf jhanda uthaae hue he
 "comments khamnei ne america par apana hit saadhane ke liye sanyukt raashtra ke istemaal kaa aarope bhi lagaaya
 He said, "the structure of the United Nations Security Council is completely irrational, unfair and undemocratic
 yah tanaashahee kaa spasht rup he, jo behad purana tathaa bekaar ho chukaa he or iske samaapan kii avadhi guzar chuki he
 " unhone kaha, "america tathaa iske sahyogi 'maanav adhikaron' kii raksha ke naam par pashchim ke hiton kii raksha karte hai
 They make military intervention in other countries in the name of 'democracy' and in the name of 'fighting terrorism' they target innocent people with bombs and weapons in villages and cities of different countries
 " He also criticized such countries (western countries) of the world, who want to keep nuclear technology limited to themselves
 gutnirpeksh andolan ke 16wein shikhar sammelan kaa udghaatan karte hue khamnei america par jamkar barase
 He said that America is misusing the United Nations to bully the world
 unhone kaha, "islamic republic of iran parmaanu evam rasinic hathiyaaron ke istemaal kaa virodh karata he or ise akshamya paap ke rup main dekhtaa he
 We have given a slogan to make the Middle East free of nuclear weapons and we are committed to it
 " Khamnai said, "but this does not mean that Iran will give up its right to use nuclear power for peaceful purposes
 antarrashtriya niyamon ke anusaar, naagarik parmaanu praudyogiki kaa istemaal duniya ke sabhi deshon ke liye sahi he
 Everyone should get the right to use this safe energy in the context of different objectives for their country
 " He said that some Western countries have nuclear weapons, but they want to limit the ability to produce nuclear fuel on their own
 unhone kaha, "isaki sabase badi bidambana america prashasan he, jiske paas vyapak vinaash ke sabase adhik or sarvaadhik ghaatak parmaanu tathaa anya hathiyaar hai, vah ekmaatr desh he jo inke istemaal ko lekar patibaddh he
 But today he is raising the flag against nuclear proliferation
 "tippaniyan Khamnai also accused the United States of using the United Nations to serve its interests
 unhone kaha, "sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kii sanrachana puri tarah ataarkik, anuchit tathaa aloktantric he

 In this case, the serious High Court has expressed concern that in view of the manner in which these cases are being settled, it is necessary to consider the formation of a new court for their hearing

 Former Finance Minister P
 chidambaram par giraftaar kii talwardhindh media maamle main dilli hoicourt se laga he jatkasupreme court main unki yachika kaa virodh karegi CBI-EDINX media cese main purv kendriya mantri pi
 Chidambaram is getting screwed
 dilli hoicourt se jhatka lagane ke baad pi
 Chidambaram has approached the Supreme Court
 lekin sibiai or idi hai ki unhen giraftaar karne par ade hue hai
 However, Chidambaram's search is still on
 aaj supreme court main idi or sibiai pi
 Chidambaram will oppose grant of interim bail
 ab adaalat main kis tarah ye agenciyaan chidambaram kii yachika kaa virodh kar sakati hai, unke peeche is tarah ke tark ho sakate hai
 If sources are to be believed, the CBI and ED will tell the court that P
W
 chidambaram jaanch main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 The CBI will also tell the court that he was constantly called for questioning, but he did not appear before the CBI
 itnaa hi nahin dilli hoicourt ne bhi apane aadesh main kaha he ki pratham drushtya main pi
 a case is made against Chidambaram, so he should not get anticipatory bail
 haalanki, ye bhi saaf he ki pi
 Chidambaram himself will not appear in the Supreme Court, but his lawyer will plead
 mangalvaar ko chidambaram ko dilli hoicourt se jhatka laga to sibiai or idi unhen giraftaar karne ke liye taiyaar thim

 isse sambandhit maamalaucchtam nyaayalay main lambit he
 Swamy said before Special CBI Judge OP Saini that since the plea for CBI probe into the role of Chidambaram in the 2G spectrum case is pending before the Supreme Court, it would be appropriate to wait for the court's decision and thereafter Chidambaram will be allowed in the case
 It would be fine to come to this court with a petition to make an accused

 upie 1 main jahaan unke bhaashanon main 'rojgaar' shabd kaa 45 baar ullekh hua vahiin upie 2 main ye shabd sirf 19 baar aayaa
 It is interesting that in the speeches of Manmohan Singh, the name of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru came up many times

 mumbai meyar chunaav se bijepi ne khud ko kiya algakorporation main bijepi ke paas aankade paryaapt nahinshivsena ne 34 parshadon ko mumbai ke resort main tehrayabharatiya janata party (bijepi) or shivasena gathbandhan par takreeban phul stop lag gaya lagata he to iskaa asar sthaneey nikaay chunaavon par bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 In Nashik, the BJP fears that the Shiv sena-congress-ncp alliance may dent its councilors
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne apane sabhi parshadon ko nasik se 600 kilometre dur sindhugarh ke ek resort main pahunchaa diya he
 The Nashik Municipal Corporation is held by the BJP
 party ko 22 november ko apana meyar chunanaa he
 The Shiv Sena also does not want to take a risk in this matter
 isliye shivasena ne bhi apane 34 parshadon ko mumbai ke paas ek hotel main pahunchaa diya he
 The BJP has 65 councilors in the 122-member Nashik Municipal Corporation
 pehle bijepi ke 67 parshad the lekin do ke istipha dene kii vajah se ye sankhya 65 rah gai
 There is also a reason for trouble for the BJP that its 12 councilors did not reach the resort in Sindhugarh and they have no trace of it
 nasik municipal korporation main shivasena ke 34, congress ke 6, ensipi ke 6 or emenes ke 5 parshad hai
 The Corporation also has 5 independents / other councilors
 ensipi-shivasena aae saathmunicipal corporation main bijepi ke takhta palat ke maukey ko bhaanpate hue ensipi ne shivasena ko samarthan dene kaa elaan kar diya
 NCP spokesman Nawab Malik told India Today, "we will support the Shiv Sena to keep the BJP out of power of Nashik and other municipal corporations
" haalanki jo antim faisla liya jayega wo congress ko vishwaas main lekar hi kiya jayega
 BJP separated itself from the Mumbai mayoral election, meanwhile, the BJP has made it clear that it will not contest the post of mayor in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)
 ye chunaav 22 november ko hona he
 BJP leader Manoj Kotak told India Today TV on Monday, "BJP will not field a candidate against Shiv Sena because we do not have figures in the corporation
" ”shivasena ummidavaar ko samarthan kii sambhaavna ke bare main puche jane par manoj kotak ne kaha ki party ko abhi is mudde par faisla lenaa baaki he
 'BJP gets majority in 2022' BJP leader Ashish Shelar said in a tweet, "we are currently in a minority in BMC
 hamaare paas paryaapt aankade nahin hai
 But we will not join hands with the opposition
 2022 main hamaare pasbahumat kaa aankada hoga or hamaara hi meyar hoga
 "as far as the Congress is concerned, it is not ready to open the cards yet
" maharashtra main congress netaaon kaa kahana he ki unhen hai kaman ke nirdeshon kaa intazaar he
 According to Congress leader Ravi Raja, “our councilors are going to meet on Monday afternoon where they will be informed about the decision of the party high command
 ”2017 main shivasena or bijepi ne alag alag chunaav ladaa tha lekin bijepi ne shivasena ke meyar ummidavaar vishwanath mahadeshwar ko samarthan diya
 At that time Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had worked out the pressure tactics
 sutron ne bataaya ki bijepi ababiemasi main vipaksh ke netaa pad ke liye aavedan kar sakati he
 Explain that BMC is among the richest local bodies in the country
 ab badale raajnneetik ghatnakram main biemasi main meyar pad kaa chunaav pehla aisa mauka hoga jab shivasena or bijepi aamane saamne honge
 By November 18, the parties have to seal the names of their candidates
 film kaa naam: 'da gaji atake' diarector: sankalp reddystar cast: atul kulkarni, ke ke menon, rana daggubatti, taapasi pannu, om puri, rahul singhvadhi: 2 ghanta 05 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 3
 5 Starikaran Johar did the poster release of Rana Daggubati's film There have been many wars between India and Pakistan which you are aware of but there was also a fight about which very few people know
 1971 kii samandar ke bheetar kii ladaai par aadhaarit he film 'da gaji atake'
 Let's know how the story of the film is and what is special about it
 
 
 kahaneeyah kahani saal 1971 kii he jab bangladesh ko east pakistan ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 At that time, Pakistan Army used to take strict action against the rebel people of Bangladesh
 17 navambar ko bhartiya nau sena ke headquarter main khabar aati he ki pakistan kii taraf se samundar ke raste bharat ke ienes vikrant par ek atake kiya jane vaala he
 Naval Head VP Nanda (om Puri) constitutes Operation 'search Land' to identify the responsibility of submarine captain Ranvijay Singh (KK Menon) and Lieutenant Commander Arjun (rana Daggubatti) named S21
 It is in the hand
 saath hi is dal main devraj (atul kulkarni) bhi maujuud hote hai
 How S21 then underwater attacks the PNS Ghazi of Pakistan and shoots them is shown during the film
 'da gaji atake' main kuch is andaaj main najar aaengi tapasikyon dekh sakate hai ye film- yah film us ansuni kahani ko darshaati he jo shaayad bahut hi kam logon ko pataa he or diarector riter sankalp reddy ne bade hi anokhe andaaj main puri kahani dikhaai he
 In which sometimes you are emotional, sometimes you sit holding a chair and sometimes the feeling of national love is also awakened
 - film kii cinemetography kamaal kii he jisaki vajah se aap sach main pandubbi ke bheetar or baahar hone vaali ghatnaon ko mahasoos kar pate hai
 - The presence of great actors like Atul Kulkarni, KK Menon makes this film even more attractive
 vahin rana dagubatti or rahul singh kaa kaam bhi saraahneey he
 Om Puri Saheb also acted as smooth as ever though he left us all before he could see this film
 taapasi pannu kaa bhi chota lekin acha role he
 - The film's VFX and background score is also a compliment
 vahin dialogs bhi sateek hai
 Funny is the trailer of this film of Taapsee
 
 
 kamjor kadiyanyah film item sangs, masala jokes or kamedi se bharpoor nahin he or kahen to commercial film bilkul nahin he
 It reveals facts along with acting which may not suit the mood of everyone

 ab phaayde yaa nuksaan kaa pataa weekend ke baad hi chalegaa
 Before the people of the world, who remain silent and sympathetic to all the previous murders, come to ask about the murder of BJP worker in Bengal, written and spoken not for any formality but for actually doing something on the violence in Bengal needed
 yah ghatana sharmnaak he
 Crowd politics has now taken place everywhere
 iske vistaarakon ke liye is tarah kii hatyaein ek mauqe se zyaada kuch nahin he
 But this is a dangerous sign for those who believe in a crowd-free non-violent democracy
 is tarah kii ghatnaayen raajnneeti kaa rasta kuch khaas logon ke liye surakshit kar rahi hai
 Those who have money and those who have strength
 bengal kii yah ghatana bataati he ki zamin par raajnneeti karnaa utana hi mushkil hota ja rahaa he jitna paise waalon ke dabaav se mukt hokar raajnneeti karnaa
 This dalit worker of BJP was killed because he was favoring the party
 kisi bhi lihaaz se vah loktantr main ek vaidhanik kaam kar rahaa tha
 It is not illegal or unethical to support any party
 raajnneetik hinsa ke chapete main bengal main har dal ke kaaryakarta maare ja rahe hai
 Just like Kerala
 in donon rajya main satta paksh or vipaksh donon ke haath main hinsa kaa hathiyaar he
 The only difference is that the one who has power has many ways of cruelty and is more cruel
 vipaksh bhi vahi khel khel rahaa he
 People are being killed who work for a party on the frontline
 bengal ke panchayat chunaavon ke pehle or baad main hui hinsa ko lekar kitni aalochana hui, magar uskaa kuch asar nahin hua
 Violence continues even after the election
 rajya ke raajnneetik dal kabhi hinsa ko lekar eemaandaar nahin rahe
 If someone pretends to be a religious procession, someone makes ambush alone, then someone plans to blow up the house
 mamata banerjee aag se khel rahi hai
 He has been in power for a long time, so he is responsible for not stopping this culture of violence
 yah bhi sharmnaak he ki unka hi kaaryakarta kyon maaraa jaataa he, kya unke kaaryakarta bhi surakshit nahin hai
 Or it has become so heartless that BJP workers are not safe
 afsos he ki is hatya ke baad bhi hinsa ko khatm karne par sahmati nahin banegi, iskaa istamaal hoga, duusari jagahon kii hinsa ko jaays tehraane ke liye
 Activists should understand that they are being used in the game of big leaders
 uski jaan kii keemat par yaa phir use mukademon main fansaa kar kuch logon ke satta sukh bhogane kaa intazaam ho rahaa he
 i wish these workers would revolt once
 26 may ke hindu main subhojit bagchi kii khabar he ki bengal main jhargram or purulia zile main bijepi kaa pradarshan acha rahaa he
 In a block of Jhargram, BJP gave up the seat for the Adivasi Samman Manch

 BJP state president Dilip Ghosh has also admitted to the reporter that there was agreement with the tribal coordination platform
 hamaara koi aupchaarik samjhauta nahin he magar ham donon tiemasi se lard rahe the
 We know them and can also work in the future
 ghosh ne maovadi se samjhaute kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 But the Maoists had issued an appeal in places where the BJP did not field candidates to vote for the tribal coordination platform
 poster bhi lagaae the
 If this is the case then there is sure to be more blood in Bengal
 vam sarkaar ke jamaane se isaki kooni raajnneeti apni jagah par bani hui he
 The characters who play it just keep changing
 bijepi ke dalit kaaryakarta kii purulia main hi hatya hui he jise maar kar ped se taang diya gaya he
 a warning has been pasted on the corpse that the same will happen if it supports the BJP
 teen din pehle hyderabad main bheed ne ek trans-mahila ko maar diya, kyonki whatsap se afawaah fail gai ki wo baccha churaati he
 Police has arrested two students in this case
 in par aarope he ki inhone phek video banaakar whatsap par viral kiya he
 a similar incident has happened in Jharkhand last year
 whatsap se faile afawaah ke kaaran ek bheed ban gai he or usne khoj kar kuch logon kii hatya kar di or kuch ko ghayal kar diya
 India is really becoming a zombie
 har jagah ek public taiyaar he, jise main robo public kahata hum
 That public needs a rumor, a provocation is needed, it fizzles out
 kisi par tut padati he
 This crowd is sometimes driven by ideology and false propaganda, sometimes by false arrogance of power supremacy
 magar in donon tarah kii bheed ek hoti ja rahi he
 The comments isliye hinsa kaa virodh kiijie, sirf ghatana kaa nahin, us ghatana ke aas paas hone vaali prakriya ko bhi samajhie
 Whether it is in a state with a party government, whether it involves people inspired by any ideology or if there are people who commit violence in a fit of sudden anger
 aap likhen tab bhi virodh karen, na likh paaen tab bhi virodh karen
 This matter has gone out of hand, one has to work hard to stop it
 netwa sab nahin karegaa, aapako karnaa padegaa

 This incident in Bengal shows that doing politics on the ground is becoming as difficult as it is to do politics free from the pressure of money lenders
 bijepi ke is dalit kaaryakarta ko isliye maar kar taang diya gaya kyonki yah party kii tarafadaari kar rahaa tha
 In any sense, he was doing a legal work in democracy
 kisi dal kaa samarthan karnaa gair kanoonee yaa aniatik kaary to nahin he
 In Bengal, activists of every party are being killed in the grip of political violence
 bilkul kerala kii tarah
 In both these states, both the ruling and the opposition have weapons of violence in their hands
 fark sirf itnaa he ki jiske paas satta he uske paas krurta ke kai tareeke hai or wo zyaada krur he
 The opposition is also playing the same game
 maare ja rahe hai aam log jo frontline par kisi party ke liye kaam karte hai
 There was so much criticism about the violence that took place before and after the Panchayat elections in Bengal, but to no effect
 chunaav ke baad bhi hinsa jari he
 The political parties of the state have never been honest about violence
 kisi ne dharmik juluus ko bahaanaa banaaya to kisi ne akele main ghaat lagaaya to kisi ne ghar hi phoonk dene kaa plan banaaya
 Mamta Banerjee is playing with fire
 lambey samay se vahi satta main hai isliye hinsa kii is samskruti ko na roak paane kii javabdehi unheen kii he
 It is also shameful why their own worker is killed, are their workers also not safe
 yaa itane belgaum ho chuke hai ki bijepi ke kaaryakarta surakshit nahin hai
 Sadly, even after this murder, there will be no consensus on ending the violence, it will be used to justify the violence elsewhere
 kaaryakartaaon ko samajhnaa chahie ki bade netaaon ke khel main uskaa istamaal ho rahaa he
 Arrangements are being made to enjoy the power of some people at the cost of his life or by implicating him in lawsuits
 kaash ek baar ye kaaryakarta hi vidroh kar dete
 Subhojit Bagchi reports in the Hindu of 26 May that the BJP has performed well in Jhargram and Purulia districts in Bengal
 jhargram ke ek block main bijepi ne adivasee samanvay manch ke liye seat chhod di
 It has the support of the CPI Maoist
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne bhi reporter se mana he ki adivasee samanvay manch se samjhauta tha
 We have no formal agreement but both of us were fighting TMC
 ham unhen jaanate hai or bhavishya main kaam bhi kar sakate hai
 Ghosh has denied any agreement with the Maoist
 lekin maovadiyon ne adivasee samanvay manch ko vot dene ke liye un jagahon par apil jari kii thi jahaan bijepi ne ummidavaar nahin utaare the
 Posters were also put up
 agar aisa he to bengal main abhi koon karaaba or hona tay he
 Its bloody politics has remained in place since the era of the Left government
 bas ise nibhaane vaale kirdaar badalte rahete hai
 The bjp's Dalit worker has been killed in Purulia, which has been killed and hung from a tree
 laash par chetavanee chipka di gai he ki bijepi kaa samarthan karne par yahi hashr hoga
 Three days ago, a trans-woman was killed by a mob in Hyderabad as rumors spread through whatsapp that she steals a child
 police ne do chaatro ko is maamle main giraftaar kiya he
 They are accused of making fake videos viral on whatsapp
 isi tarah kii ghatana pichley saal jharkhand main ho chuki he
 a mob has created a rumor from whatsapp, and he discovered and killed some people and injured some
 bharat vaaqai zombistan banate ja rahaa he
 There is a public ready everywhere, which i call Robo Public
 us public ko ek afvaah kii zarurat hoti he, uksaave kii zarurat hoti he vah bhabhak uthati he
 It breaks on someone
 is bheed ko kabhi vichaardhaara or jhuthe propeganda se bhabhakaaya jaataa he to kabhi satta ke varchasv ke jhuthe ahankaar ke zarie
 But both these types of crowd are becoming one
 tippaniyan So resist violence, not just the incident, but also understand the process happening around that event
 chaahe wo kisi dal kii sarkaar vaale rajya main hoti ho, chaahe usame kisi vichaardhaara se prerit log shaamil hon yaa phir achaanak aae gusse se taish main aakar hinsa karne vaale log hon
 Resist even when you write, do not resist even if you write
 yah maamla haath se ja chukaa he, ise rokane ke liye kadi mehnat kerani padegi
 Netwa will not do everything, you have to

 There was so much criticism about the violence that took place before and after the Panchayat elections in Bengal, but to no effect
 chunaav ke baad bhi hinsa jari he
 The political parties of the state have never been honest about violence
 kisi ne dharmik juluus ko bahaanaa banaaya to kisi ne akele main ghaat lagaaya to kisi ne ghar hi phoonk dene kaa plan banaaya
 Mamta Banerjee is playing with fire
 lambey samay se vahi satta main hai isliye hinsa kii is samskruti ko na roak paane kii javabdehi unheen kii he
 It is also shameful why their own worker is killed, are their workers also not safe
 yaa itane belgaum ho chuke hai ki bijepi ke kaaryakarta surakshit nahin hai
 Sadly, even after this murder, there will be no consensus on ending the violence, it will be used to justify the violence elsewhere
 kaaryakartaaon ko samajhnaa chahie ki bade netaaon ke khel main uskaa istamaal ho rahaa he
 Arrangements are being made to enjoy the power of some people at the cost of his life or by implicating him in lawsuits
 kaash ek baar ye kaaryakarta hi vidroh kar dete
 Subhojit Bagchi reports in the Hindu of 26 May that the BJP has performed well in Jhargram and Purulia districts in Bengal

 It has the support of the CPI Maoist
 bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh dilip ghosh ne bhi reporter se mana he ki adivasee samanvay manch se samjhauta tha
 We have no formal agreement but both of us were fighting TMC
 ham unhen jaanate hai or bhavishya main kaam bhi kar sakate hai
 Ghosh has denied any agreement with the Maoist
 lekin maovadiyon ne adivasee samanvay manch ko vot dene ke liye un jagahon par apil jari kii thi jahaan bijepi ne ummidavaar nahin utaare the
 Posters were also put up
 agar aisa he to bengal main abhi koon karaaba or hona tay he

 26 may ke hindu main subhojit bagchi kii khabar he ki bengal main jhargram or purulia zile main bijepi kaa pradarshan acha rahaa he
 In a block of Jhargram, BJP gave up the seat for the Adivasi Samman Manch
 ise sipiai maovadi kaa samarthan hasil he
 BJP state president Dilip Ghosh has also admitted to the reporter that there was agreement with the tribal coordination platform
 hamaara koi aupchaarik samjhauta nahin he magar ham donon tiemasi se lard rahe the
 We know them and can also work in the future
 ghosh ne maovadi se samjhaute kii baat se inkaar kiya he
 But the Maoists had issued an appeal in places where the BJP did not field candidates to vote for the tribal coordination platform

 singur kii zamin kii kisaanon ko vaapasi
 Now it seems that preparations are being made to take another big decision
 pashchim bengal kii sarkaar rajya kaa naam badalanaa chaahati he
 But this work will not be done in haste, first all the mlas and political parties will be negotiated
 naam badalane kaa kaaran bada ajeeb he
 West Bengal Industries Minister Partho Chatterjee said after the cabinet meeting that the name of West Bengal i
e
 West Bengal starts with W
 isliye jab bhi neshnal level kaa koi sarkari kyrkram hota he to a b c d ke hisaab se west bengal kaa naam baad main aata he or rajya ke numaayindon ko bolne kaa mauka sabase baad main miltaa he
 The big complaint is that by the time the representatives of Bengal stand to speak, it is too late, most of the people are tired or bored and leave
 isliye pashchim bengal kii awaz ansuni rah jaati he
 The only way Mamata Banerjee can handle this problem is to change the name of the state
 pashchim bengal ke mukhya sachiv samar ghosh ko mamata banerjee ne is bare main aage kii karrwai kaa zimmaa saunpa he
 Of course, the new name should be one that comes first in Alpha Bet
 lekin zyada pehle aa gaya to usamen bhi pareshaani ho sakati he kyonki bharat main sarkari or gaiyr sarkari kyrkramon main log vakt par nahin pahunchate der se pahunchate hai
 So one who will rise first to speak
 ho saktaa he ki use sunne vaale hi naa milen
 Therefore, at least Mamta Banerjee should not be named after Alphabet A
 yani amar bengal naam naa rakhen sirf bengal rakhen

 In the case of Vikas and his friend being granted bail from the police station, the subsequent removal of bayonets imposed on them, questions are being raised on the functioning of the police
 vahiin somvaar ko ilaake ke sisitivi footage kaa na milanaa bhi surkhiyon main bana rahaa
 Initially, the sections imposed on Vikas could be punished: Actually, Chandigarh Police had earlier registered a case against Vikas and his friend Ashish under Section 354-D and Section 185 of Motor Vehicle Act
 lekin kuch hi ghanton ke baad maamle main dhara 341, 365 or 511 ko jod diya gaya
 But for the third time, only Section 341 was added by removing 365 and 511
 ipisi kii dhara 354 d - galat iraade se peechha karnaa
 Punishment - Three year sentence and fine
 motor vical act kii dhara 185 - nashe kii haalat main gaadi chalaanaa
 Punishment - 6 months sentence and fine
 ipisi kii dhara 341 - galat iraade se rokna
 Punishment - Sentenced to one month and fine of 500 rupees
 jo dharaaen hataain gai hai:ipisi kii dhara 365 - gupt rup se or galat tareeke se vyakti ko pratibandhit karne ke uddeshy se apharan karnaa
 Punishment - Maximum 7 years sentence
 ipisi kii dhara 511 - sangeen aparaadh ko anjaam dene kii koshish karnaa
 Punishment - Maximum life imprisonment
 kya sattadhari party ke rasookh ko dekh hataai gayi ye dharaaen?yah donon hi dharaaen (365 or 511) gaiyr jamaanti hai
 Despite this, both the accused were granted bail on the same day from the police station
 aarope he ki police waalon ne pehle aropiyon ke khilaaf sangeen dhaaraon main cese darj kiya, lekin jaise hi vikaas baraala ke sattadhari party ke rasukhdaar netaa kaa betaa hone kaa pataa chalaa jaanboojhkar vikaas par se sangeen aaropon kii fehrist hataa di or maamuli dhaaraon main mukadmaa darj kar thane se hi jamaanat de di
 Renowned Chandigarh lawyer Ranjan Lakhanpal said that the police has tried to bypass the court by giving bail to the accused from the police station, as the matter is related to the party in power
 phir giraftaar ho sakate hai vikaas baraala or ashishalgataar soshal media par pakshpaat ke aarope lagane ke baad ab police ne ladki kii shikaayat or court main siarpisi kii dhara 164 ke tahat die gaye bayanon ko didie munish dua ke paas kanoonee raay ke liye bhej die hai
 After the legal opinion comes, the police will decide whether to file a case against accused Vikas Barala and Ashish under Section 365 / 511 of Kidnapping attempt
 agar didie apni report main cese darj karne kii ijazat dete hai to vikaas baraala or ashish ko dobaaraa giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he

 lekin un yugers ke liye is baar niraash karne vaali khabar he
 The company has removed the iphone 6, iphone 6 Plus and iphone 5S from its official website in India after the iphone7 and iphone7 Plus launches
 yani ab bharat main logon ke paas yphone kharidne ke limited opshan bache hai
 Either buy an iphone7 for Rs 60,000 or the iphone 7 Plus at a huge price
 iske alaava do opshan or bhi hai inamen iphone 6S, 6S Plus or iphone SE shaamil hai
 However, you still need not be disappointed, as e-commerce websites and third party retailers are still getting these smartphones

 duusare smartfones kii internal memory to zyada hoti hi hai saath hi 1TB kaa saport bhi diya jaataa he
 In such a situation, the problem of lack of storage always remains with the iphone users
