 a new book provides information about a cat that has so far predicted the death of a sick person in about 50 cases

 This cat living in a nursing home sits with patients who are near death
 brown uniwarsity ke jaravigyaani dow
 David Dosa, in his book, 'making Rounds with Oscar: The Extraordinary Gift of an Ordinary Cat', states that during the last five years, the cat 'oscar' has been proven wrong in very few cases
 ‘da daily telegraph’ ne kitaab ke hawaale se kaha he ki aise marijon ke bare main yah billi kai baar nursing home ke karmchaariyon ko bhi galat sabit kar chuki he jinke bare main mana gaya ki ve mrityu ke kareeb nahin hai
 The cat, named Oscar, grew up in the dementia unit of Steer House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Rhode Island treating Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases
 dow
 Dosa first published an article about Oscar in the 'new England Journal of Medicine' in 2007
 kitaab main kaha gaya he ki safed billi auskar nursing home ke ek kamare se duusare kamare tak gumti rahati he or un marijon ke alaava kisi ke paas nahin baithti, jinaki mrityu kareeb hoti he
 According to the book, if Oscar passes out of the room of a patient whose death is near, then he tries to beat the door of that room and enter it
 kitaab main dow
 Dosa has also given examples to substantiate his point
 unhone kaha he ki ek baar aspataal karmchaariyon ne auskar ko aise marij ke paas baithaaya, jo unke anusaar marane vaala tha, lekin auskar vahaan se ‘kudakar’ duusare kamare ke ek marij ke paas baith gai

 dosa kaa kahana he ki vah or unke sahyogi auskar kii bhavishyavaanee par vishwaas karte hai or isi vajah se aise marij ke parivaar ko bhi pehle se sachet kar dete hai

 When the Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was asked about Aaj Tak's 'mumbai Manthan' program about Shiv Sena's aggression against him and Narendra Modi, he said that it is a daily game here
 iske aage unhone kaha ki congress aurencipika astitv kahin nahin bachaa he or unki vishwasaneeyata khatm ho chuki he
 So there is no fight with them and people are with Modi ji
 mumbai manthan kaarykram main aae ensipi netaa sharad pavaar ke bayaan par bhi devendra fadanvis ne pratikriya di
 He said, 'pawar saheb and his party should see all the elections of the last chal years, they do not exist anywhere
 nagar nigam se palika or jila panchayat tak ke chunaav ham jite hai or wo kahin nahin hai
 Taunting the ncp's position in the Lok Sabha elections, Fadnavis said that the future of the country is not decided by those whose 6-7 mps are elected

 BJP has made a strategy to surround the Congress in its own fort
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main rahul gandhi ko amethi main gherne kii kavayad kii thi, jiske chalate congress ko apana kila bachaane main paseene chhot gaye the
 This time the BJP has planned to surround Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli
 isi maddenjar bijepi adhyaksh amit shah 21 april ko raibareli ke daure par rahenge
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi had recently said that if the SP, BSP and Congress contest the elections together, PM Narendra Modi will lose the election from Varanasi
 rahul par bijepi ne palatwaar karte hue kaha tha ki rahul piem modi kii nahin amethi or raibareli kii chintaa karen
 The strategy of besieging Sonia is being seen in the Rae Bareli tour itself with the preparations for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 shah apane daure main congress ke kile ko bhedane kaa bhi plan he
 MLC Dinesh Pratap Singh, who is angry with the Congress, along with his MLA brother Rakesh Pratap Singh and Zilla Panchayat Awadhesh Pratap Singh, can join the BJP by saying goodbye to the party
 dinesh singh ne saaf kah diya he ki ab congress main nahin rahanaa he
 Shah's visit to the district has a lot to do with the changing political equation of Rae Bareli
 aise main bijepi alaakaman apane daure ke jariye bada sandesh dene ke liye dinesh singh or unke bhaaiyon ko party main shaamil kara sakate hai
 The entry of these Congressmen in BJP is a big face in the politics of Rae Bareli
 wo jahaan khud emelsi hai to unke ek bhai harchandrapur se vidhayak or ek bhai jila panchayat adhyaksh hai
 All three have won on the Congress ticket
 aise main bijepi main shaamil hote hai to ye congress ke liye apane garh main bada jhatka hoga
 Whereas BJP will try to create an atmosphere in the country's politics through this
 ajay agarwal nahin de sake the takkarbata den ki pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne sonia gandhi ke saamne ajay agarwal ko maidan main utaara tha
 Despite the Modi wave, he could not present a tough challenge to Sonia
 yahi vajah thi sonia ne kareeb 3 lakh se zyada maton se bijepi ummidavaar ko haraaya tha
 In such a situation, BJP has planned a siege of Rae Bareli in 2019
 rahul ke khilaaf smriti iranigauratlab he ki 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ne congress ko amethi main gherne kii ranneeti ke tahat rahul gandhi ke saamne smriti irani ko maidan main utaara tha
 Rahul was sweated out to win against Irani
 haalat ye ho gai priyanka gandhi ko amethi main deraa jamaana padaa
 After this, Rahul could win by one lakh votes
 jabaki isse pehle wo teen lakh se zyada voton se jeet hasil kii thi
 Pasinmriti Irani may have lost the election to Rahul, but PM Modi gave a gift to fight in front of Rahul and made him a minister and included him in his cabinet
 irani pichley chaar saal se amethi main sakriy he
 She is constantly visiting Amethi and continues to surround the Congress high command by raising local issues
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main amethi sansadeey kshetra ke tahat aane vaali sabhi siten congress haar gai thi
 While the alliance with SP was in the fray
 amethi ke tarj par raibareliamethi kii tarj par ab bijepi raibareli main aisi hi chunauti pesh karne kii taiyaari main jute gai he
 Under this, the BJP high command is going on a tour of Rae Bareli
 wo raibareli ke sthaneey netaaon or party kaaryakartaaon ke saath loksabhaa chunaav kii ranneeti par charchaa karenge
 On the same feedback, BJP can field a strong candidate against Sonia from Rae Bareli

 Former India captain Rahul Dravid wants a settlement in which the world's best cricketers can play for their country in Test cricket and also play the Indian Premier League
 pichley ipel main rajasthan rails ke captain rahe dravid ne kaha ki mujhe iskaa hal pataa nahin he lekin main chahta hum ki duniya ke sarvshereshth cricketer ipel or test cricket donon khel saken
 He said that players like Chris Gayle and Kevin Pietersen are excellent Test and T20 cricketers
 unhen apni pratibha dikhaane ke puure maukey milane chaiye
 Dravid said that ultimately the game is for the audience only
 sarvshereshth khilaadi apane desh ke liye khelen
 This is not only for the spectators coming to the ground but also for the youth who like Test cricket
 yadi sarvshereshth cricketer desh ke liye nahin khelen to yah bahut niraashajanak hota he
 He said that a formula should be made for this
 england or dakshin africa ke bich lords par tisare test ke dauraan bibisi ke test match special ne dravid ke hawaale se kaha ki yah sach he ki ipel ahm he or log ise dekhnaa chaahate hai
 He said that a time will come when 'give and Take' will be necessary
 yaa to ipel ke liye windo banani hogi yaa toornament chota karnaa hoga
 Dravid said a solution to this is necessary as IPL dates will continue to collide with the start of the England cricket season and the exclusion of big names like Pietersen and Chris Gayle is not in favor of Test cricket
 emsisi cricket samiti kii baithak main hissaa lene ke liye landan main maujuud dravid ne kaha ki ipel ke saath kuch sakaaratmak chijen judi hui hai or aapako yah samajhnaa hoga ki agar duniya bhar ke sheersh khilaadi isamen khelnaa chaahate hai or log ise dekhnaa chaahate hai to isamen kuch acha to hoga hi
 He said that this would particularly affect the England season as the England season traditionally starts at the same time for the last several years
 isliye yah thodaa chunauteepurn he
 When the time comes, we will reach a stage where everyone would like to play the best player (test cricket)
 dravid ne kaha ki ham sabhi chaahate hai ki westeindies jab bhi test match khele to kris gail uski ore se khele
 None of us want to face a situation where a legendary player like Kevin Pietersen is out of the team, whatever the reason may be and does not want to talk about the reasons but it is disappointing
 jab sheersh khilaadi test cricket nahin kheltaa to isse khel ko hi nuksaan hota he

 The Lahore bus tour had been very helpful in easing india-pakistan relations, especially when the two countries conducted nuclear tests only a few months ago
 yatra ke do maheene baad hi kargil kii jang hone kii vajah se duniya ne vaajapeyi ko shantidoot or pakistan ko hamalavar ke rup main dekhapradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ke kaarykaal kaa ek nirnaayak lamhaa tha farvari 1999 main unki lahore bas yatra
 This was a decision that was inimical to the possibility of a radical change in the relationship between India and Pakistan
 tape-tapaae siyasatdan vaajapeyi main ise samajhane kii chaturaai bhi thi or har cheez main bura dekhne waalon ko kaayal karne kii bahaduree bhi
 As Joint Secretary in charge of Disarmament and International Security Affairs in the Ministry of External Affairs of the Central Government, i had been involved in all the rounds of intermittent Foreign Secretary level talks since 1990
 "samgr vaarta'' ke jis maujuuda dhaanche par 1997 main pradhanmantri indrakumar gujral ke kaarykaal main sahmati bani thi, 1998 ke parmaanu pareekshanon ke baad usamen rukaawat aa gai thi
 After the trials and subsequent uproar, Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif met in New York in September 1998 during the session of the United Nations General Assembly
 us vakt liye gaye faislon main dilli or lahore ke bich bas seva shuru karnaa bhi shaamil tha
 i remember that i had told my colleague and friend, Joint Secretary Vivek Katju, who was handling the affairs of Pakistan, that this was the first summit between two countries that had conducted nuclear tests and declared themselves nuclear-armed countries a few months ago
 There was a strange result
 vivek ne samajhadaari se mujhe bharosa dilaayaa tha ki bharat-pakistan ke rishton main haroonges chizon kii kabhi kami nahin hogi
 Two months passed without any further progress on the delhi-lahore bus
 donon deshon kii suraksha agenciyon ne chintajanak sawaal khadey kar die, baatcheet lambii khinchati gai
 In early January, Sharif called Vajpayee and shared his concern that the announcement made in September about the delhi-lahore bus is not yet complete
 vaajapeyi ne unhen bharosa dilaayaa ki ve maamle ko dekhenge or principal secratory brajesh mishra ko agenciyon ke bich pragati kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane ko kaha
 After a few meetings, the issues were resolved and the Pakistani side was informed that we are ready to start the bus service in February
 us vakt dotarafa shikhar sammelan kii koi baat nahin hui thi
 It was expected that Vajpayee would flag off the first bus in Delhi and it was believed that Sharif in Lahore would do the same
 chunki vaajapeyi bich farvari main amritsar kii yatra par jane kaa kaarykram bana rahe the, isliye suzav diya gaya ki ve amritsar se bas ko hari jhandi dikhaa sakate hai
 In undivided Punjab, these two cities were often called twin cities and there was a distance of 40 km between the two, but in 1947 these links were broken
 pratik ke taur par amritsar se bas ko jhandi dikhaanaa wagha-ataari ke daravaajon ko kholane ke baraabar hota or yah dilli se iskaa udghaatan karne se kahin zyada pratikatmak bhi hota
 Now events took a turn that no one expected
 ganatantr diwas ke kareeb aate-aate sharif ne phir vaajapeyi se phone par baat kii
 He thanked them for expediting the bus project and asked if it was true that they were preparing to flag off the bus from Amritsar
 jab vaajapeyi ne tasdik kii, to unhone jawaab diya, "aap meri dahalij par aakar waapas ja rahe hai
 This does not happen in our culture
 aapako mere ghar aane kii izzat bakhshani hi hogi
 i will receive you in Lahore
 '' vaajapeyi ne unhen dhanyavad diya or phone karne kaa vaada kiya
 The matter was urgent and urgent because we were worried that the invitation received on the phone might not be leaked
 mantrimandal ke varisht saathiyon ke saath salaah-mashvira shuru hua
 Opinion was divided
 kuch ko laga ki duusare shikhar sammelan se pehle paryaapt taiyaari ke liye zyada vakt kii darkaar thi
 Some others felt that this would convey a good message to the region and other superpower countries
 hindustan or pakistan donon paabandiyaan jhel rahe the or pashchimi ranneetik samudaay main kai log dakshin asia ko lekar aagaah kar rahe the ki yah sabase khatarnaak newclear flashpoint he
 In our strategic dialogue with the US and France, we were pushing forward the idea of india being a responsible and restrained country armed with nuclear weapons, and a successful visit would have strengthened it
 safataur par yah siyaasi bulaava tha or vaajapeyi ne aakhirkaar nyotaa manjuur karne kaa faisla liya
 The dates of 20-21 February were taken out and preparations soon started to appear like Hindustani procession

 In a meeting with Brajesh Mishra in late January, i asked him what kind of results we were expecting from the Lahore talks 
 sanyukt vaktavy to tay baat hi thi, par maine poocha ki hamen isse zyada kuch kaa lakshya lekar chalanaa chahie yaa nahin
 He understood the importance of the talk and i drafted a pamphlet on Confidence Building Measures (CBM) i
e
 confidence-building measures
 1990 se hi ye dotarafa baatcheet ke agenda kaa hissaa rahe the, par ab ahm fark yah tha ki ye sibiem do atomi hathiyaaron se las deshon ke bich honge
 The Pakistani side also responded well to this prescription
 manore vivek apane pakistani samakakshon jameer akram tathaa salmaan bashir ke saath baarikiyaan tay karne ke liye farvari ke pehle hakrate main lahore gaye
 Akram worked in Delhi in the early 1990s and was the Director General in charge of India, while Bashir was the director general of affairs related to the United Nations and later served in Delhi as High Commissioner
 phir vah emoyu bana jis par 21 farvari ko do videsh sachivon, ke
 Raghunath and Shamshad Ahmed signed
 ab saaf ho gaya ki yah emoyu kuch zyada hi takneekee tha
 Then the idea of a small Lahore manifesto was born which would be a political document and which would be signed by both the Prime Ministers
 in dastavejon ne yatra ko khaasaa vajan diya
 Two lasting memories of the journey are associated with Vajpayee
 unka minar-e-pakistan janaa or yah elaan karnaa ki ek sthir or samrudh pakistan hindustan ke hit main he
 It was a work of political courage and vision
 duusari yaad unka vah bhaashan he jo unhone governor house main yojit naagarik abhinandan ke vakt diya tha
 He spoke without a written speech, and when he finally read the lines of his poem Jung na hone, there was not a single eye in the audience that was not wet
 sharif ne lanbaa jawaab na dene kii samajhadaari barti or unase sirf itnaa kaha ki ab ve pakistan main bhi chunaav jeet sakate hai
 The visit to Lahore was the result of several coincidences, but it was Vajpayee's visionary rich politics that turned it into an never-ending legacy

 In the next few hours, the developed and developing countries in this city of Germany have to get together and agree on the important terms of implementing the Paris Agreement during the 2016 Paris Climate Conference
 kya he paris agreement?paris agreement ke tahat sabhi deshon ko prithvi ke ausat taapmaana ko audyogikeekaran se pehle ke taapmaana str se mahaj 2 degree adhik tak main simit rakhana he
 However, under the Paris Consensus, an aggressive policy to solve the problem of global warming causes global temperatures to be 1
 5 degree taapmaana vruddhi tak simit karne kii jarurat he
 Why is it special? Bonn Climate Conference: During this year between the Climate Conference and the 2016 Paris Conference, a lot of new research has emerged
 nae tathyon se pataa chalaa he ki maujuuda samay main global warming kii raftaar us str se bahut zyada he, jiskaa anumaan paris conference se pehle lagaaya gaya tha
 Therefore, at the Bonn Climate Summit, all sides need to set more aggressive targets in the effort to save lives on Earth
 yah bhi padhein: dilli main 2018 se hi lagu honge BS-VI niyam, badhate pradooshan ke chalate sarkaar ne liya faisla197 main 170 deshon kii he sahmatigauratlab he ki 197 deshon ke fremawork kanvension on climet change ke tahat hue paris agreement ko 170 deshon se sahmati mil chuki he
 Significantly, India and China have also agreed to the Paris Agreement
 in donon deshon ko bhi apni dwaara clamet change main yogadan kaa lakshya nirdhaarit karnaa he
 America out of Paris Agreement? US President Donald Trump announced his exit from the Paris Agreement in June 2017 after winning elections in November 2016
 paris agreement se baahar nikalate vakt trump ne kaha tha ki is agreement ko lagu karne se america arthvyavastha ko jhatka lagegaa or vaishvik arthvyavastha main vah hameshaa ke liye pichad jayega
 During his election campaign, Trump had said that the Paris Agreement would damage America's business interests and would also leave large numbers of people unemployed
 kyon dar rahaa america?paris agreement ke tahat sabhi deshon ko jalwaayu parivartan ke liye kii ja apni koshishon kaa lekha-jokha rakhana hoga
 All countries will also have to show the results of the efforts to save the environment in their respective countries on a global scale
 lihaaja america or europe samet aise desh jahaan audyogikaran kaa str adhik he ko bhi apane dwaara global warming main ho rahe yogadan kaa bhi khulaasa karnaa hoga
 It is important to note that the equally stringent provisions will need to be made to keep the climate change at the prescribed level of global change in the global warming of Paris Agreement

 'aapkaa bataa den ki bijanour main ajam ne modi kii vaivaahik sthiti ko lekar tanj ksaa tha
 Azam had said without naming Narendra Modi, 'he does not have a family, so he cannot understand the pain of others
 meri bivi he, mere do bachche hai or ek hamaara badshaah he jo in sabase maharoom he
 On this, Adityanath said on Monday that pigs also produce a lot of children here and Azam Khan may have got the inspiration to have a child from there
 ajam ko bachche paidaa karne ke liye pakistan chale janaa chahie
 On Tuesday, Azam Khan had commented on PM Modi and said that he is doing politics of narrow mindset
 unhone kaha ki piem ne id par mubaarakabaad tak nahin di
 In such a situation, the narrow mindset of him and the BJP has been exposed
 madhya pradesh kii bijepi sarkaar or carch 17 maah main duusari baar takaraav kii raah par hai
 Last time there was a tussle between the two over the implementation of Right to Education (RTE)
 isai samudaay gaiyr-sahaayta praapt alpsankhyak skulon main artii ko thopane ke khilaaf hycourt ja pahunchaa tha, jahaan sarkaar ko munh kii khaani padi thi
 The court upheld the March 2013 order of implementation of RTE, calling it a violation of the fundamental rights of unaided minority schools
 is baar kii ladaai bhi kaaphi aage bad sakati he
 The root cause of this quarrel is the recommendation of the Madhya Pradesh State Minorities Commission (MPSMC) to the Madhya Pradesh Christian Board on the lines of the Waqf Board to oversee Christian religious assets
 ayog kii 5 agast kii baithak main ek sadsy anand barnard kii aguai main chaar sadasyon ne madhya pradesh isai board ke gathan ke prastaav par rajamandi jaahir kii thi
 The Minorities Commission, and especially Bernard, have been arguing in favor of forming a Christian board for nearly six years
 barnard protestant hai or unka daawa he ki unke is prayaas se catholic isai bhadak uthe hai or hycourt kaa darwaja khatkhatane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 Bernard calls the formation of a board to protect Christian assets an immediate necessity as cemeteries are being sold in many places, including Jabalpur
 unke mutabik, ek din aisa bhi aa saktaa he ki protestant samudaay ke paas rajya main koi jaaydaad hi na rah jaae
 They allege that with the involvement of some priests, the land mafia has sold many properties of Christians across the state
 ve kehete hai, ''main apane samudaay kii jameen bachaana chahta hum chaahe iske liye koi bhi keemat kyon na chukaani pade
 Many people in my community are in favor of the formation of the board, while some people of the community are selling the land
 ''lekin pradesh chrishchiyan association kii adhyaksh or empsaimasi kii purv sadsy indira ingar kaa kahana he ki alpsankhyak ayog ko isai board banane kii sifarish karne ke pehle isai padariyon se baatcheet kerani chahie thi
 She says, "the proposed board is not going to benefit the Christians, rather it will only serve to grab the land of the Christians
" sarkaar ko isaayiyon ko akelaa chhod dena chahie
 She cannot do good to the community
 protestant or catholic, donon board ke khilaaf hai
 If the government moves towards making boards then we will go to court
 ''(jabalpur ke hawabag methodist carch kii kai sampattiyon kii bikri vivaadon ke ghere main )darasal aazaadee ke pehle 1927 kaa bhartiya carch kanoon hua karata tha
 But after India became a republic, no such law ceased to exist
 barnard kehete hai ki kerala main bhi isai sampattiyon ke prabandhan ke prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 According to him, Christian property has become the fief of some priests and their families who are selling it fraudulently
 unka daawa he, ''dharm or samudaay se judi jaaydaad main sirf padariyon kii chalati he
 i want the common Christian to have a right to speak in the matter of community property
 anek isai mujhe saamudayik jaaydaad bachaane ke liye kehete hai
 "he says," i have been excommunicated from the society by the Catholic clergy
 main jaanata hum ki carch kii sampattiyon ke liye niyam bananaa krantikari kadam he or main iske liye har nateeja bhugatne ko taiyaar hum
 Jesus Christ was also crucified to oppose the priesthood
 yahaan tak ki isa ko bhi singog ko vyavsaayik gatividhiyon se mukt karaane ke liye bal kaa prayog karnaa padaa tha
 By the way, Bernard's question is bound to be
 unke mutabik, ''musalamaanon kii majahabi jaaydaad kii dekharekh vakf board karata he or uske tahat ek tribunel har vivaad kaa nibatara karata he, sikh samudaay ke maamle shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti nibataati he, parsi samudaay kii saamudayik sampattiyon kaa prabandhan parsi anjuman karti he or hinduon ke maamle hindu mandir kanoon se tay hote hai to isaayiyon kii saamudayik sampattiyon kii dekharekh ke liye isai board kyon nahin banaaya ja saktaa? ''is par, bhopal main catholic diosij arq bishap liyo carnelio kaa jawaab he, ''jameen hamen viraasat main nahin mili, inhen hamane kharida he
 We have a strong system of managing our properties
 inke prabandhan ke liye hamen isai board kii jarurat nahin he
 We do not use real estate to make profits or money, but charitable
 hamaara makasad garibon kii madad karnaa, jaruratmandon kii seva karnaa or unhen shikshit karnaa he
 If someone tries to curb our rights, we will seek legal help
 '' haalanki ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''isaayiyon ke kabristaanon ke prabandhan ke liye agar vakf board kii tarj par board banaaya jaataa he to mujhe koi aapatti nahin he

 haalanki bakaul barnard ke 2007 main bataur empsaimasi ke sadsy unhone carch kii sampattiyon ke prabandhan ke liye vyavastha banane kii disha main kaam shuru kiya hi tha ki catholic empsaimasi ke khilaaf is daleel ke saath hycourt pahunch gaye ki ve carch kii sampattiyon ke liye niyam banaae jane ke khilaaf hai
 Here his petition was dismissed
 phir ve supreme court main gaye lekin baad main unhone yachika waapas le lee
 Expressing fears of political motive behind the formation of the board, State Bishop Conference spokesman Johnny P
 je
 mpsmc's recommendation is unfortunate
 ve kehete hai, ''barnard ne shaayad sarkaar ko khush karne ke liye aisi sifarish kii hogi
 "we manage our properties in an organized and organized manner," says Johnny
 hamen angrejon se koi jaaydaad muft main nahin mili he
 Our registered charitable institutions have purchased these properties, so there is no question of someone else managing it
 hamen vakf board kii tarj par koi sanstha nahin chahie
 If such a situation comes, we will move the court
 ''isai samaaj kii sanstha rashtriya isai mahasang ke sanyojak anand muttungal bhi barnard kii manshaa par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 According to him, Bernard raises this issue only when his membership of the MPSMC is about to expire three years
 ve kehete hai, ''is baar bhi unka kaarykaal agast main khatm ho rahaa he
 They are seeking to get another term by waging a dispute
 teesraa kaarykaal paane ke liye ve hindu kattarpathiyon ko khush karnaa chaahate hai
 According to Muttungal, he withdrew the petition filed in the Supreme Court three years ago after the government's assurances in the Assembly that the Christian board would not be initiated

 a two-day session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly has begun, though the session was announced a week ago
 satr kaa pehla din ek-duusare par aarope-pratyarope main hi guzar gaya
 As soon as the proceedings started on the first day of the session, Leader of the Opposition Vijender Gupta termed the session as incorrect, stating that as per the rules, the tradition is set for the first session of the new year
 vijender gupta ne kaha ki niyam main pehle satr ko har baar uparajyapal sambodhit karte hai, lekin is baar aisa nahin kiya gaya
 Gupta said that the government is breaking the tradition and does not trust constitutional traditions
 gupta ke is aarope par vidhansabha spikar ramanivas goyal ne aapatti jataai
 The speaker said that this has not happened for the first time, but has also happened before
 vidhansabha ke spikar ne daleel di ki ye satr nayaa nahin balki pichley satr kaa doosraa bhaag hi he

 "captain Amarinder Singh, going from Delhi to Chandigarh by road, parked his car on the side of National Highway-1 and immediately said yes

 It was unusual for Sonia Gandhi to make such a request, especially when she had expressed reluctance to contest the Lok Sabha elections by meeting him three weeks earlier and Sonia had given her consent

 He also expressed his reluctance in some TV interviews

 In the opinion of many senior leaders of the party, the calls made directly from 10 Janpath are a sign of a new attempt by the first family of Congress, in which this family is indicating the solidarity of its strategy: Sonia and her children Rahul and Priyanka Despite their different efforts, they are working together to create collective power
 sonia ne bhale hi 2014 ke aam chunaav kii kaman bete rahul ko saunp di ho, lekin ve ab bhi party kii adhyaksh hai or party par unka puraa niyantran he
 In this way, they are the surveyors

 Sonia got Nanded and former Pawan Kumar Bansal a ticket from Chandigarh despite former Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan being stained by corruption
 unhen tikat na dene kaa matlab jurm sweekaar kar lenaa hota jabaki abhi donon hi maamle lambit hai
 According to the report of the Association of Democratic Reforms in March, BJP has fielded 35 percent candidates with criminal background while the Congress list has only 27 percent of such candidates
 agar rahul kii chalati to chavaan ko tikat nahin miltaa

 On March 26, when a journalist questioned about giving Chavan a ticket in the program of releasing the Congress manifesto, Sonia said to Tapak, "I will answer
" ” or kehane lageen, ''jahaan tak ham jaanate hai, chavaan ko chunaav ladgaye se koi kanoon nahin roktaa
 "his sharp reply and aggressive stance gave a clear message that there are many Congress leaders whose party leadership will not only defend, but the party will never sacrifice the winning candidates in the name of cleanliness
" yah ravaiya rahul ke tareeke se alag he
 The same attitude was also adopted in the case of candidate Imran Masood in Saharanpur

 Two days before the session, Rahul rehearsed the speech in front of Priyanka late in the night at 12-tughlaq Lane, while Priyanka suggested him to be impassioned, as well as aggressive during the speech

 There were also occasions when the inner secret of the Congress could open, such as on 7 January

 Among the leaders present were Ahmed Patel, Mistry, Janardan Dwivedi, Ajay Maken and rgf's Mohan Gopal
 sutron ke mutabik, 8 disambar ko hue vidhansabha chunaavon main party ko mili shikast ke baad prastaavit badlaavon ko darkinar karne kii rahul kii yojana par kuch ''varisht party netaaon ne gambhir aapatti jataai thi” or isi vajah se europe gaye rahul ne vaapasi kii taarikh aage khiskaa di
 Now the task of resolving the differences between the senior leaders and Rahul is left to Priyanka
 asahmati ke bich sahmati banane main priyanka ko kahin adhik paripakv mana jaataa he
 Nevertheless, as the news of this meeting spread outside, the Congress senses got upset and there was an atmosphere of chaos in the party
 congress ke ek netaa or kendriya mantri kehete hai, ''party main priyanka ke liye ek swaabhaavik sahmati kaa maahaul he
 If the talk of his growing activism in party affairs is leaked, then a demand for a bigger role may arise for him which will not be right for Rahul
 ”isse pehle us baithak main shaamil hone se janardan dvivedi sire se inkaar kar chuke the
 When she came to know that TV cameras had imprisoned her while leaving 12-tughlaq Lane, she had to issue a statement that "priyanka is an active political activist of Congress and she has been meeting party workers for a long time
" agar ve party netaaon se milti hai to isamen chaunkane vaali baat kya he?” dvivedi ke bayaan kaa marm party ke bheetar priyanka ke bade kad kii hi pushti he
 Young leaders associated with the party's electoral strategy speak openly about Priyanka's activism
 priyanka kii nai bhoomika ke bare main poochne par party ke mukhya chunavi ranneetikaar jairam ramesh ne kaha, ''ve koi sanyasin nahin hai
 He has a sharp political mind
 vichaar or jaankaree ke maamle main hamaare liye ahm strot hai
 Many of his suggestions are accepted
 ”2004 se lekar teen loksabhaa chunaavon main ahm bhoomika nibhaa chuke ramesh kehete hai ki chunaavon main to priyanka hameshaa se sakriy rahi hai, lekin is baar kaa muqabla sabase mushkil he
 He says, "the challenge this time is bigger
 hamaara muqabla 10 saal kii sattavirohi bhaavana or ek aakraamak vipaksh se he
 "with Priyanka during this difficult election, Rahul's confidence has increased
 rahul ke bhaashanon ko antim rup dene se lekar prachaar abhiyaan or prachaar saamagree ke alaava priyanka tivi charchaaon main party pravaktaaon ke pradarshan par bhi najar rakhti hai
 In Priyanka's feedback, not only the spokespersons' colloquial methods but also their attire and gestures are closely accounted
 haal hi main ek pravaktaa tii-shart pahanakar prime time tivi samachar ke dauraan charchaa main bhaag le rahe the
 Priyanka reveals this to Kanishka Singh and thus the feedback reaches the communication department
 rahul ke kareebi kanishka, kaushal vidhyaarthee, alankaar savai or bi
 By the way, Biju does not report to Priyanka, but keeps him informed about every single thing related to Rahul
 akasar priyanka inamen se kisi ko bhi phone karke jaankaree leti rahati hai
 She also often gives necessary suggestions on strategy related issues
 ve unheen netaaon se baat karti yaa milti hai jinase milanaa jaruri samajhati hai
 Sources say that if it is not related to the election campaign, then Priyanka keeps herself separate from the party's everyday work
 rahul badlaav kaa pairokaarparty kii chunavi ranneeti banane or rahul kii chhavi nikhaarane main priyanka agar mukhya bhoomika nibhaa rahi hai to iske kaarnon ko samajhnaa mushkil nahin he
 While the electoral challenges stand before the Congress, the Gandhi family's own ability to woo voters is also under question
 chunavi muqablon main rahul ko baar-baar mil rahi asafalataaen or paridrishy se unki lambii anupasthiti kii vajah se party kaaryakarta sanshay main hai
 Sonia has given him a lot of open ground
 rahul us maidan main utarane se hichakate rahe hai
 On the other hand, the government's failures on many fronts have already accelerated the party's downfall
 sonia ne karishmai vyaktitv kii dhani priyanka ko aage badaae se roka hua he
 He fears that Priyanka's personality will overshadow her brother
 party main logon kaa maananaa he ki rahul ne jin badlaavon kaa vaada kiya tha, unka asar dikhne main na sirf deree ho rahi he balki unke kaaran dheron samasyaayein paidaa hone kaa bhi khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 But due to her style of taking everyone along, Priyanka is acting as a bridge between her brother Rahul and those leaders whom Rahul does not like
 gandhi parivaar ke kareebi maane jane vaale ek netaa kehete hai, ''congress adhyaksh ne priyanka ko shaamil karne kaa faisla karne main bahut der kar di
 "their point shows that it is now too late to salvage the party in this election
" lekin bhavishya main ummid kii ja sakati he
 The assembly election results were a warning to the Gandhi family
 pichley saal ke shuru tak party ke aantarik survey main pataa chalaa tha ki congress ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 But it was estimated to get around 150 seats
 phir janvari, 2014 main kiye gaye aantarik survey main pataa chalaa ki use sirf 75 siten hi mil rahi hai
 Although Rahul has been constantly trying to bring about systematic changes in the party and to make it fit, the results of the assembly made it clear that stopping the party's downfall is the immediate challenge
 sonia or priyanka ne kaaphi der se kadam rakhaa he, unhen ab yahi sochna he ki is nuksaan ko kitna kam kar sakate hai
 The party not only has to face 10 years of anti-incumbency sentiments, but it also has to save the declining morale in the party
 agar rahul safal hote hai to ve ek nai vyavastha laaenge jisamen party ke kai netaaon ko lagata he ki unke liye koi jagah nahin hogi
 a 17-year-old girl, along with a neighbor in Anantpura, Kota, Rajasthan, were involved in several incidents of rape

 After the rape with the teenager, the body of the teenager has been recovered from the old well in a village in Palani police station area of banda district of Uttar Pradesh

 Superintendent of Police Shalini said that the body of an unknown 16-year-old teenager was recovered from an old well near Bhuianrani Devasthan amidst bushes in the forest

 Suddenly, the Chief Minister is shocked to see the Chief Minister knock at the door

 Mamta Banerjee is preparing to win over the public with this surprise politics
 charchaa he ki mamata banerjee yah daanv chunaav ranneetikaar prashanth kishor kii salaah par chal rahi hai

 achaanak ghar ke saamne mukhyamantri ko dekhakar log kuch samaj nahin paa rahe the
 The reason why he did not know that in such a sudden the Chief Minister would reach to solve his problems

 Mamta Banerjee was to go to a meeting with the administrative officers in Howrah
 baithak main jane se pehle vah haavda ke do number round tanks len kii jhuggi-jhopadiyon main achaanak pahunch gayi
 They knocked on the houses
 daravaaje khule to andar pahunchakar mahilaon, bacchon or purushon se baat kar unki samasyaayein jaanee
 It was found that the slum dwellers have problems with water, sanitation, ration etc
 jhuggi-jhopadiyon kii asaliyat dekhne ke baad mamata meeting lene pahunchin or unhone baithak main afasaron ko jamkar latad lagaai
 Taking up the issues related to the meeting, he not only introduced a class of officers but also asked the officers of Howrah Municipal Corporation, Food and Supplies Department to reach the spot and solve the problems
 itnaa hi nahin mantriyon, vidhayakon or sthaneey janpratinidhiyon kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ne task force bhi gathit kii

 com / 1nr1pnt25d China is now taking the path of Ladakh to increase pressure on India in the Doklam dispute
 is ilaake main sarhad ke najadik ke chini faujee pul banane kii koshish main juty hai
 In fact, China, which has been bugging Doklam for 55 days, is now engaged in encircling India through the path of Ladakh
 doklam main chini fujen sadak banaakar vivaadit ilaake kii yathasthiti se chhedchhad karne kii sajeesh kar rahi thim to ladakh main line of ektual control (elesi) ke paas bhi chini fujen aisi dadaageeri dikhaane par utar ai hai
 No man's land, that is, even between the border of the two countries, the Chinese army is not descending from its antics
 darasal jammu kashmir se lekar arunachal takabharat or chinake 4 hajaar kimi se bhi lambey border par doklam ke alaava bhi kai aise point hai, jahaan donon deshon ke bich seemaa vivaad kaa masalaa he
 Where there is no dispute, China continues to show needlessly aggressive attitude
 mana ja rahaa he ki doklam par bharat ko dabaav main laane ke liye china nai ranneeti ke tahat seemaa ke duusare binduon par dabaav badha rahaa he
 But China may have forgotten that the Indian army, which had kept it on its knees for 55 days in Doklam, is as vigilant and attentive in Ladakh as in any part of the border
 chaahe khun jamaa dene vaali thand ho yaa barf kii aandhi, yahaan sarhad kii chaukasee karne vaale bhartiya javaanon ke kadam roak paanaa kisi ke bas kii baat nahin
 There is already pressure on India regarding Doklam, China is already eyeing Ladakh
 ladda main elesi par donon deshon kii sena ke bich border personal baithken kaaphi pehle se hoti rahi hai lekin is baar china ne ye silsilaa bhi roak diya he
 These meetings between the armies of the two countries were held in Daulat Beg Oldi region
 aadhi baithken bhartiya to aadhi chini kshetra main hoti thim
 This time due to the Doklam dispute, the Chinese army did not take any initiative for these meetings
 lekin china kii is berukhi or dadaageeri se alag bhartin jawan sarhad ke is ilaake ko har halaat ke liye taiyaar rahane ke kaabil banane main jute hai

 Earlier, the Aam Aadmi Party had demanded to conduct the Municipal Corporation elections in Delhi with ballot paper, but in view of time constraints, Arvind Kejriwal has now demanded the ballot paper to be used for the new EVM machines with VVPAT

 Arvind Kejriwal said that in the year 2013, the Supreme Court had said that it is more reliable to conduct elections through evms with VVPAT, more recently the UP Election Commission has written a letter to the Central Election Commission saying that it is in Uttar Pradesh Do not want to conduct elections with the old machines of Generation 1 because those machines are bad and they are allowed to conduct local and civic elections from the paper ballot Mr

 Kejriwal said that Generation 1 evms are bad and replacing them with paper ballot is a better option
 kejariwal ne sawaal uthaaya ki aakhir kya vajah he ki dilli chunaav ayog rajasthan se jenereshan 1 kii behad hi saadhaaran or asurakshit iviem ko mangakar dilli nagar nigam chunaav karana chahta he?arvind kejariwal ne rajasthan ke dhaulpur main kathith taur par evam ke saath chhedchhad kaa hawala bhi diya
 Arvind Kejriwal, in a meeting with the Chief Electoral Officer, said that when the Central Election Commission of the country has modern evms in Delhi as well as VVPAT machines, then the Delhi Election Commission should now use those machines in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi elections
 aam aadmi party ne dilli chunaav ayog ko dilli municipal act kii section 4 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki niyam ke tahat yah praavdhaan he ki nigam chunaav ko aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he, lekin iske liye centre sarkaar ko likhnaa padegaa or yah faisalaa centre sarkaar ko lenaa hoga
 In such a situation, there is only one week left in the election and in such a situation, if the VVPAT is not arranged with paper ballot or new EVM, then the election can be proceeded under section 4 of the DMC Act
 halaki dilli chunaav ayog ne aam aadmi party kis maang ko khaarij kar diya

 input: IANS Today Azad is the death anniversary of India's first vice-president and the second President of veteran educationist Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
 saal 1975 main aaj hi ke din lambii beemaari kii vajah se unka nidhan ho gaya tha
 He was considered one of the best teachers in the world and he used to say that Sarvapalli used to say that a good teacher is one who keeps on learning and does not show any inhibition in learning from his students
 dow
 Radhakrishnan was born on 5 September 1888 in Tirutani village, Tamil Nadu
 inke pita sarvapalli veeraswami rajasav vibhaag main kaam karte the
 His mother's name was Sitamma
 inaki praarambhik shiksha lunarth mishanri skool, tirupati or vellore main hui
 He then studied at Madras Christian College
 1903 main yuvati sivaakamu ke saath unka vivaah hua
 Radhakrishna, the first trainmaster, who had left India 165 years ago on this day, had studied the Bible and the philosophy of Swami Vivekananda at the age of 12
 unhone darshan shaastra se em
 a

 He worked as a teacher for 40 years
 ve 1931 se 1936 tak andhra vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati rahe
 However, he did not even take salary as vice-chancellor
 iske baad 1936 se 1952 tak oxford vishvavidhyalay main praadhyaapak ke pad par rahe or 1939 se 1948 tak vah kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati pad par asin rahe
 He studied Indian culture deeply
 abraham linkan: garibi main kataa bachapan, phir aise bane US ke raashtrapativarsh 1952 main unhen bharat kaa pratham uparashtrapati banaaya gaya or bharat ke dwitiya raashtrapati banane se pehle 1953 se 1962 tak vah dilli vishvavidhyalay ke kulapati the

 There is a saying in the election environment of Western UP, popularly known as Jat Land, that it is 'whose Jat, its chic' means that the party or candidate who gets the support of the Jat voters gets crossed
 aisa hi samarthan hasil karne kii chunauti bagpat seat se rashtriya lokdal ke pratyaashee jayant choudhary or bhartiya janata party ke pratyaashee satyapal singh ke saamne he
 Both are Jat leaders
 jayant ke parivaar kaa yah garh rahaa he or satyapal singh police kamishnar kii jimmedaari sanbhaalane ke baad chunavi baitarani main pehali baar 2014 main utre the
 Jayant Chaudhary's road is a bit more difficult because this seat has been the legacy of his grandfather Chaudhary Charan Singh and father Chaudhary Ajit Singh, but in 2014, when Modi wave started, Satyapal Singh defeated Jayant Chaudhary's father Chaudhary Ajit Singh He took possession of this seat of his family
 ab ajit singh mujffarnagar seat se lard rahe hai or jayant choudhary bagpat se pehle baar bhagya aajamaa rahe hai
 In 1977, 1980 and 1984, former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh won the Bagpat seat, considered a Jat stronghold
 iske baad unke bete choudhary ajit singh 6 baar is seat se saansad rahe
 Chaudhary Ajit Singh was elected MP from Baghpat in 1989, 1991, 1996, 1999, 2004 and 2009
 choudhary charan singh ne jab se is seat se chunaav ladanaa shuru kiya tha, uske baad 1998 or 2014 main areldi (ralod) ko yahaan haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 During the election campaign, the most important reason for rld's reign in Jayant Chaudhary Baghpat is the excess of Jat voters here
 is seat par chaar lakh se zyada jat matadaata he
 Apart from these Gurjars, Yadavs, Dalits and Tyagi voters also play an important role in the battle of Baghpat, while Muslim voters also have a large number here
 dilachasp baat ye he ki yahaan kaa adhiktar muslim voter mula jat kehalaata he
 The same equation has till now brought Charan Singh and his son Ajit Singh, known as farmer leaders, to Parliament
 lekin 2014 main bijepi ke satyapal singh ne modi lahar main choudhary ajit singh se yah seat chin lee thi
 Not only this, RLD was also shocked in the 2017 assembly elections and won just one assembly seat (chhaprauli)
 jabaki sivalakhas, badot, bagpat or modinagar seat par bijepi ne jeet darj kii thi
 The results of 2014 were disappointing: Chaudhary Ajit Singh's 2014 election results in his stronghold were very disappointing and he stood at number three
 bijepi ke satyapal singh ko 4,23,475 vot, sapa ke gulam mohammad ko 213,609 vot or areldi ke choudhary ajit singh ko 1,99,516 vot mili the
 However, this time the situation is different and the SP-BSP and RLD are contesting the elections together
 bagpat seat se bijepi pratyaashee satyapal singhhaalanki, sapa se alag hokar alag party banane vaale shivpal singh yadav ne jarur choudhary mohammad mohakam ke rup main muslim pratyaashee utaara he
 In such a situation, the RLD, fighting with the SP, is making big claims about victory
 haalanki, jayant choudhary pehali baar is seat se kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 He had won the Mathura seat for the first time in 2009, but was defeated by Hema Malini of BJP in 2014, after which Jayant Chaudhary has now taken over the legacy of his ancestors

 assam ke sonitpur or kokarazarjilon main hue hamale ke baad kendra sarkaar ne sakht tevar dikhaaye hai
 The Army has launched 'operation All Out' against the banned National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) in association with Assam Police and CSF
 yah sanghathan pichley kai saalon se assam main bodo adivasee samudaay ke liye ek alag rajya kii maang uthaata rahaa he
 The Center has made it clear that there will be no discussion with the militants at any level
 sonitpur or kokarajhaar main bacchon or mahilaon ko bhi nahin bakhsha gaya
 This Tabilani attack of Bodo militants proved to be as terrible as the Peshawar attack, in which more than 70 people lost their lives
 assam main ye masalaa nayaa nahin he
 Ethnic violence in Assam bordering Bangladesh and Bhutan has been a major problem for many years
 bodo ugravadi yahaan ke gaiyr bodo logon ko nishaanaa banaate rahe hai
 The total population of the state of Assam is more than 30 million, of which about 10 per cent are Bodos
 darasal is vivaad kii jad bangladesh se ghuspaith kar yahaan based musalamaanon ke saath sangharsh se judi he
 There was a political motive of the erstwhile governments for settling them here
 assam kii congress sarkaron par aarope lagata rahaa ki ve vot khatir bangladeshi musalamaanon ko yahaan basaati rahi
 The Bodo tribals, who were already anti-government in mind, became furious with being given asylum and then the kathal-e-aam phase started with the demand for a separate state
 bharat sarkaar ne is vivaad ke niptaare ke liye assam main bodo kshetreey parishad (beatisi) kii sthapana kii
 Those who make administrative decisions there themselves but the responsibility of law and order is that of the state government
 bodo ugravadi beatisi se santusht nahi hai
 This issue was further complicated by two organizations standing against Bodo militants
 alag bodo rajya kii maang ke khilaaf hai gaiyr-bodo suraksha manch or akhil bodoland muslim chaatr sangh
 There is also bloodshed when members of these organizations come in front of Bodo militants
 2012 main 100 se zyada gaiyr-bodo maare gaye or kareeb 40 hajaar logon ko duusari jagahon par jaakar sharan leni padi
 Now the Indian government has started work on a plan to deal with the Bodo militant organization NDFB
 lekin sawaal ye he ki kya javaabi karrwai se inke hausale post honge? kya sena ke saamne ye log hathiyaar daal denge? kya kuch bodo ugravadiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar dene se is gambhir samasya kaa hal mumkin he? aisa lagata to nahin
 Because the Bodo militants have established their camps in Bhutan and Myanmar
 yaheen se unhen eke-47 jaise aadhunik hathiyaar bhi mil rahe hai
 Although the army has also included China, Bhutan and Myanmar in their latest campaign against these militants, it remains to be seen how effective this mission will be

 The court had said that it would be decided first whether the Constitution Bench's 1994 decision needs to be reconsidered, in which the offering of Namaz in the mosque is not the integral part of Islam
 iske baad hi tital suut par vichaar hoga
 In 1994, a five-judge bench directed to maintain status quo in Ram Janmabhoomi so that Hindus could worship
 peeth ne ye bhi kaha tha ki masjid main namaaj padhanaa islam kaa intregal part nahin he
 Dispute in court for 68 years, let us tell you that this dispute has been in court for almost 68 years

 The government has failed to understand the velocity of public mind

 bhagava aatank nahin shaury kaa pratik he
 " How did everyone get acquitted when the blast happened ?" In response to this question, Prasad said, "this raises the question whether the investigation was corrected at that time? Wasn't pressure created? Those who call the NIA parrot number 2, this is their old work
 hamaare apane log giraftaar hue
 Ministers resign in Kathua
 pradhanmantri modi or adhyaksh amit shah ko kitne saal tak fansaaya gaya, kitne keson main fansaaya gaya
