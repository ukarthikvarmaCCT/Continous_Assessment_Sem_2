 kuraishi ne apane jawaab main ek or vaikalpik number diya
 Qureshi wrote in the message- 'give 9810 xxrep 4 * 14 too, i am traveling tonight

 Based on the alleged call records, the ED warned the CBI that the meat trader acted as a middleman to get benefits from the officials and leaders of the government

 When former CBI Director AP Singh was contacted by India Today regarding these intercepts, he refused to comment
 congress netaa raashid alvi ne apni pratikriya main modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki wo vipaksh ke khilaaf propaganda chalaa rahi he
 Alvi said, "the NDA government has been in power for four and a half years, why didn't it take any action earlier?" Why is the government propagating through such leaks? ”BJP leader Amitabh Sinha said,“ There should be a thorough investigation into the revelations from these intercepts

" ’ This evening, the train to Varanasi was standing too late on platform number two of Kanpur railway station
 main plateform number ek par lakhanu-dilli shatabdi ke aane kaa intazaar kar rahaa tha
 Just then, a boy jumped from a car going to Varanasi and knocked the track and came to me
 selfi ke liye
 i even scolded him for what you are doing, so he answers that you need a selfie
 mere saath khadey log bhi use samajhane lage
 i also explained that you have done a very wrong thing
 main use samajha hi rahaa tha ki isi bich maine dekha ki jis bogi se ladkaa kud kar mere paas aayaa tha, vahiin se ek or ladkaa mere paas aane ke liye kudana chahta he
 i started shouting that please do not do this, then i caught sight of another boy who was crawling under the same train's bogey
 patari par train khadi thi or chakkon ke bich uskaa sharir
 i do not notice if my sister's screaming voice does not reach the ears
 main yah dekhne ke liye muda ki vah chikh kyon rahi hai, meri nazar bogi ke neeche se nikalate ek ladke par padi
 Soon many people shouted loudly that they leave early
 varanasi jane kii train ne siti maar di thi
 i also joined the shouters
 vah baahar aayaa hi tha ki us jagah se train kaa pahiyaa guzar gaya
 Even after coming out, he did not agree
 ek or baar vah jhuk kar haath badhaane laga ki plateform number ek se logon kii awaz tej ho gai
 People were screaming that don't
 mobile ke liye jaan mat do
 But he stood stubborn and calm
 ek-ek kar gaadi kii bogi guzar rahi thi
 i ran towards the police
 kshan bhar pehle police dal dikhaa tha
 i looked but did not see
 waapas aayaa to log ab bhi chilla rahe the ki mat karo aisa
 i quickly took a picture of the boy
 is tasviir main vahi ladkaa khadaa he
 Well, he kept waiting for every bogey to pass
 jaise hi aakiri bogi guzari ladke ne chil kii gati se mobile par jhapatta maaraa or uthaakar plateform par chadh gaya
 Now he started running to catch the last bogie of the train that had left for some time
 kisi filmi khalanaayak kii tarah
 The beats of those standing on platform number one again increased
 ve phir roko-roko chillane lage
 The boy had boarded the train
 selfi or mobile ke liye pleez aisa mat kijiye
 Even if i get hurt for taking a selfie with me, i am not able to forgive myself, but the passion to go under the bogey for mobile has crossed all limits
 khayr ham shatabdi main baith gaye

 jammu-kashmir kii mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti kii nirvivaad rup se sabase tej netaa, piples democratic party (pidipi) kii adhyaksh 56 varshiya mahabuuba mufti aaj usee mukaam par hai jisaki araju unhen hameshaa rahi he
 There is no question that he has to take over his father's succession
 bilashak, aaj unke liye bada sawaal yah nahin he ki is mukaam par ve kab pahunchin, balki yah he ki kin halaat main pahunchi hai
 The occasion has come with deep sorrow for the first woman Chief Minister to take over the reins of the country's most turbulent state because of the untimely death of Mufti Mohammed Saeed on 7 January
 apane pita or rajnatik guru ke guzar jane ke gam main dubi mahabuuba ke liye kashmir main betarah vibhajit rajnatik maahaul main mufti kii maut par gamajada logon ke sailaab ko dhyaan main rakhkar yah badi chunauti hogi ki ve unke adhure kaam ko kaise aage jari rakhti hai
 Mehbooba sure faces huge challenges
 agar unhen apane chune hue vakt main mukhyamantri kaa pad sanbhaalanaa hota to shaayad yah kaam aasaan hota
 Now to succeed, they have to do the impossible job of balancing
 yah santulan unhen ghati or jammu ke bich, srinagar or dilli ke bich, apane (pidipi ke) mukchay rup se muslim samarthakon or bijepi ke hindu samarthakon ke bich aise sadhana hoga ki jaise mukrati mohammad said ne koshish kii or 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main pidipi ke sabase badi party ke rup main ubharne ke baad bijepi se gathjod karke janadesh kaa sammaan karne main kuch had tak kaamyaab hue
 Unfortunately, for Mehbooba, all this has to be achieved without the advice of Mufti Mohammad Saeed or the relationships formed in all kinds of parties if he has been in politics for nearly six decades
 yahi nahin, unke paas prashasan yaa sarkaar chalaane kaa bhi koi sidhaa anubhav nahin he isliye kaiyon kaa maananaa he ki ve is morche par aasaani se phisal sakati hai
 jnu-educated economist Haseeb Drabu, who resigned as chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Bank to become the state's finance minister in March last year, says to India Today, "don't know why, everybody forgets the reality that Mehbooba Mufti It is the PDP that has created and reached this point
 ” pita or putree, donon ke hi kareebi maane jane vaale drabu kehete hai ki siyasat main apane bees saal main mahabuuba ke solah saal party kii khaak chaanane main hi beete hai, isliye unamem aisi rajnatik samaj he jo kisi tarah kii rajnatik yaa prashasnic pariksha ko paas kar sakati he
 Despite being the eldest of Mufti Mohammed Saeed's four children and his declared political heir, one can hardly call the rise of Mehbooba another example of dynasty in Indian politics
 haalanki unhone apana pehla chunaav 1996 main bijabehada se apane pita ke kehane par hi ladaa tha
 At that time, Mufti Saheb was the head of the state Congress and after a very turbulent six years of President's rule in the state, no one was ready to fight on a party ticket but during this time Mehbooba emerged as a political leader on her own
 1999 main jab mufti ne congress se alag hone kaa faisla kiya to mahabuuba unki bagal main majboot kandhon ke saath khadi thim or unhone nae sire se party ko khadaa karne main kaaphi mehnat kii
 Both father and daughter had a wonderful bond
 mufti srinagar main apni kashmir kendrit ranneeti taiyaar karte rahe jabaki mahabuuba uske liye jameen taiyaar karti raheen or is tarah pidipi main sabase lokapriy chehre ke taur par ubharin
 In 2002, the PDP, which stood just three years ago, won 16 assembly seats and formed a Mufti government under a three-year pact of chief ministership with the Congress
 2008 main mahabuuba ne apni party ke liye 21 siten jeetne main kamyaabi hasil kii or agle chah saal tak neshnal conference or congress gathjod kii sarkaar ke khilaaf sakriy raheen or mukhyamantri umr abdulla ke khilaaf logon kii naaraazgi bhunaati raheen
 After all, in 2014 the PDP won all the three seats of the valley, then it was decided that Mehbooba's hard work was paying off
 saat maheene baad vidhansabha chunaav main party 28 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar lauti or sarkaar banaai, haalanki ek asambhav-se gathjod main party ko usee se samjhauta karnaa padaa, jise vah rajya kii ashaant haalat kaa sabase bada jimmedaar maanati rahi he
 Nobody was expecting such an agreement and both the PDP and the staunch "nationalist" BJP had to put aside controversial issues
 bijepi ke liye yah apane jammu ke janaadhar ko bharosa dilaane ke liye sarkaar main pahunchane kaa anokhaa mauka tha to mufti ke liye kashmir or jammu main buree tarah vibhajit janadesh kaa sammaan karne ke liye apni kashmir niti ko alag rakhane kaa bahaanaa tha
 The PDP also got a chance to separate its sympathy politics from the separatists
 lekin das maheene baad mufti mohammad said duniya ko alavida kah chuke hai or mughaliya shaan vaale daara shikoh park ke chinar ke ghaney vrikshon ke neeche dafnaae ja chuke hai
 The park is next to his ancestral home in Baba locality of Bijbehara
 yaheen unka janm hua tha
 In these ten months, there has been no significant progress towards implementing the sixteen-page alliance agenda between the PDP and the BJP
 donon partiyon ke bich vaicharik matbhed tikhe bane hue hai jisase jab-tab vivaad khadey hote rahe hai
 The matter is the release of a separatist leader, or the ban on beef and the hoisting of the state flag according to the recent Jammu and Kashmir Constitution
 darasal, inhen vivaadon se mahabuuba kii mushkilon kii shuruyaat ho sakati he
 Of course, the Mufti was a much disguised leader
 ve bade dhiraj se donon taraf ke ugr tatwon or muddon ko sanbhaalane kii kala main maahir the
 But Mehbooba might not have this mastery of her father
 mahabuuba ke bare main yah charchit he ki ve bijepi ke saath sarkaar banane ke paksh main kabhi nahin thim
 But his talk never came on the public stage
 sirf ek baar jab unhone jammu kii ek press conference main “us paar ke log kah diya tha to kaaphi bavaal machaa tha or isse bijepi ke bare main unki dharna bhi jaahir ho gai thi
 Or was his opinion expressed when he intervened and freed the Hurriyat leaders in August 2015 on the call of Pakistan National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz when he was detained before reaching Delhi
 haalanki yah ranneeti shaayad pidipi ke kaaryakartaaon main algaav kii bhaavana ko dur karne ke liye apanaai gai thi, jo lambey samay se kashmir kii pareshaaniyon ke liye bhagava parivaar ko doshi maanate rahe hai
 This has also raised doubts in both Jammu and Delhi
 iske alaava mahabuuba kii pichhali raajnneeti bhi bhagava parivaar main andeh paidaa karti rahi he, kyonki mahabuuba maare gaye aatankiyon ke pariwaron se milti rahi hai or kai baar unhen rajya samarthit ikvaani guton se suraksha muhaiyaa karaati rahi hai
 Many believe that it will be difficult for the BJP to keep pace with Mehbooba as the Chief Minister
 jammu-kashmir maamalon ke prabharee bijepi mahasachiv ram madhav 8 janvari ko mufti ke antim sanskaar ke baad mahabuuba se mili the
 But his opinion was somewhat cautious
 11 janvari ko unhone kaha, “meraa yah kehane kaa bahut man ho rahaa he ki sab kuch sahaj hoga lekin ham yah jaananaa chahenge ki unki (pidipi kii) soch kya he
 Now PDP will have to come forward
 ” ram madhav ko rajya main pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii nitiyon ko aage badhaane vaala mana jaataa he
 However, Ram Madhav also says that his party is in favor of maintaining the existing system in the state
 haalanki mahabuuba agar apane puraane rajnatik tewaron par lautne kii taiyaari karti hai jo 1999 main pidipi ke gathan ke samay se hi rahaa he to bijepi or centre sarkaar maujuuda gathjod ko jari rakhane ke bare main punarmoolyankan karne par majaboor ho sakati hai
 At the moment, Drabu, who was away from the government after the imposition of Governor's rule on the night of 9 January, also seems uncertain about the future
 ve kehete hai ki 7 janvari kii subah dilli ke akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) main mufti ke nidhan ke baad mahabuuba se unki koi baatcheet nahin hui
 But they also say that it will be easier and less difficult to run alliances with BJP than to join any possible alliance with Congress
 drabu pichley saal janvari or farvari main ram madhav ke saath lambii gopneey baithkon ke baad gathjod (bijepi-pidipi) kaa agenda lekar aae the
 He dismisses that Mehbooba did not fully agree to an alliance with the BJP then
 ve kehete hai, “haa, bijepi ke saath gathjod karne kaa faisla mufti said kaa tha
 But if Mehbooba had been a little bit out of it, this alliance would not have happened
 isamen do raay nahin ho sakati
 Drabu also dismisses that the BJP has been somewhat apprehensive about Mehbooba
 ve kehete hai ki farvari 2015 main mahabuuba jab amit shah se milane dilli gayi thim “tabhi se ve bijepi ke netaaon se utani hi judi hui rahi hai jitne unke pita mufti sahab
 His communication with them has been very smooth
 ” unke mutabik, bijepi ke netaaon ne sthitiyon ko sanbhaalane main unki maharath kii tarif kii he
 He says, "mehbooba Mufti has her own way of thinking and she has firm opinions in every matter
 lekin ve pichley 10 maheenon ke muddon ko bhi dhyaan main rakhti hai
 "drabu is very confident that Mehbooba, as Chief Minister, will not stand apart from Mufti Saheb and will take care of every sensitivity
 ve kehete hai, “kaam karne kii unki apni style he
 This will be the only change
 ”mahabuuba ke samarthak haal ke maheenon main mufti sahab kii tabiyat bigadgaye ke baad unke tewaron main badlaav kii baaten bhi karte hai
 For example, at a Delhi seminar in early December, Mehbooba spoke to Pakistan during Vajpayee's tenure, but also praised the Modi government's decision to send External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to Islamabad to start the peace process
 isi tarah ek hafte baad pidipi ke mukhiya ne elaan kiya, “kashmiriyon ke bahumat ko ehsaas ho gaya he ki bandook se unki samasyaon kaa koi hal nahin ho saktaa
 "with this, he also said like Mufti that the PDP-BJP alliance is like opening the door to new opportunities for Jammu and Kashmir
 kai logon kaa maananaa he ki mufti kii asamay maut se philhal puri pidipi mahabuuba ko unka “iklauti swaabhaavik uttaradhikari” maan rahi he or puri ekajutata dikhaa rahi he
 Even senior party leaders Muzaffar Hussain Baig from Baramulla and Hamid Karra, who defeated Farooq Abdullah in Srinagar, have become staunch supporters of Mehbooba these days, opposing the Mufti's candidature of expressing their aspirations
 
 srinagar main 20 janvari ko beg ne kuch shairana andaaj main kaha, “meri raay main ve apni abba se behatar sabit hongi
 Go see, he will get a lot of praise later
 ”is gam ke daur main vipaksh kaa ravaiya bhi sahanubhutipurna rahaa
 In one conversation, his arch-political rival, former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said, "why should we suddenly assume that Mehbooba is not capable of taking the alliance forward?" Mehbooba has agreed to the alliance
 ” haalanki ve yah bhi kehete hai ki unke liye aage ke halaat “mushkil” honge
 Experts believe that a bigger challenge for Mehbooba, even from the BJP and the Center, will be how to restore his party's credibility in the Kashmir Valley and the Muslim-majority areas of Jammu
 ve kahati rahi hai ki hamen apana swa-shashan chahie or niyantran rekha to nakshe par khinchi hui ek line se adhik kuch nahin he
 Restoring this credibility will not be easy in the turbulent state of the state as there is hardly a young man of twenty five years in the valley who remembers a day when violence did not erupt
 yani yuva logon main kaaphi gussa or algaav he jo unhen algaavvaad kii ore le ja saktaa he
 Mehbooba will also get the possibility in the state which her father is missing
 ve aisi sarkaar kii mukhiya hongi jiske paas 80,000 karod ru
 The package amount will be provided
 pradhanmantri modi ne 7 november ko srinagar main is package kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said Rs 1,200 crore
 kii us file par bhi dastakhat kar die hai jo sitambar 2014 kii bheeshan baadh ke hajaaron peediton ke punarvaas ke liye he
 This amount has been handed over to the state government on 5 January
 durbhaagya se, ekwas ke isiu main lete mufti hosh ganvaane ke pehle tak lagaataar baadh peediton kii rakam kii maang uthaate rahe hai
 He is no longer there but for his daughter this package will be useful to make a difference on the ground
 shaayad yah logon ke dilon ko jeetne main vaise hi kaam aayega jaisaa ki mufti bhrashtachar dur karke or vikaas ke jariye karnaa chaahate the
 Few people will consider ten months of second term as chief minister as a mufti because the promises of rehabilitation and development like Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh remain unfulfilled
 magar unki asli kamyaabi yahi he ki unhone jammu-kashmir kii mukhyadhara kii raajnneeti main bijepi ko pravesh dilaa diya
 Hasib Drabu says, "all the big parties are in almost the same situation
 jammu-kashmir ke maamle main sirf bijepi hi bahari jaisi thi
 "mufti Muhammad Saeed insisted on an alliance with the BJP because it won an overwhelming majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
" ise ve jammu-kashmir ko baaki bharat ke kareeb laane kaa ek saadhan maan rahe the
 After coming to the state government for the first time, BJP leaders also began to realize the intricacies of local conditions and politics
 drabu kehete hai, “main yah dekhakar hairaan tha ki pradhanmantri modi ke saath baithak ke dauraan rajya ke bijepi ke mantri sthaneey enechapisi bijli pariyojnaon ko rajya sarkaar ke tahat karne kii maang kar rahe the
 This was impossible until a year ago
 ” unka kahana he ki bijepi kii “jammu-kashmir main yah ghar vaapasi mufti kii sabase badi kamyaabi rahi he
 It is like his legacy
 ”udaar hurriyat netaa 80 varshiya abdul gani bhatta aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay main mufti ke sahpaathee rah chuke hai or rajnatik matbhedon ke baavjood donon ke beeche tajindagi dosti bani rahi he
 Bhat sees a ray of hope in Mehbooba
 yah bujurg algaavvaadi netaa apane dost ke duniya ke vidaa hone par dukh jaahir karne 8 janvari ko achaanak srinagar ke gupakaar road par mufti ke sarkari nivas ferevyuu cottage main pahunch gaya
 He did not care for any formality
 mahabuuba ke bare main ve kehete hai, “vah samajhadaar khatun he or vah har masale kaa hal nikaal legi
 "however, they also say that a lot will depend on the india-pakistan dialogue and the way forward will be decided by that
 shanti vaarta agar kaamyaab rahati he to mahabuuba or yah gathjod bhi kaamyaab rahegaa
 Otherwise, Bhat said, "I can only pray to God for him
" ” shaayad ve ishaaron main mahabuuba kii mushkilon kaa bhi zikr rahe the

 Comedian Krishna Abhishek says he likes to make the family audience laugh, so he will never do a porn comedy
 krishna ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki ashleel kamedi se aapaki chhavi par asar hota he or agar sex kamedi karte hai to aap apane paariwarik darshakon ko kho dete hai
 i have done many shows all over the world and the audience comes to me and says to me, 'please do not do any sex comedy or we will stop watching your show
 'abhinayta govinda ke bhaanje krishna ne kaha, 'mere sho main kuch aise hasya hote hai, jisaki bhashaa vyask jaisi lagati he, lekin yah utani hi hoti he
 i do not want to lose my family audience
 'govinda ne jahaan haal hi main kaha tha ki unhen sex kamedi ke liye apni patni kii ijaajat leni padegi, vahiin krishna kehete hai ki vah kabhi bhi sex kamedi nahin karenge
 Krishna said, 'yes, there are some films like' Grand Masti 'which are making money, but i am not interested in being a part of such films
 mere mamaa govinda ko dekhie unhone saalon tak darshakon kaa manoranjan kiya he or paariwarik darshakon ne unke kaam ko saalon tak pasand kiya he
 Krishna is currently hosting the television show 'kuch Kuch Karega' for Entertainment and says he has previously rejected offers to host several shows
 apharan kar phiroti vasuulana badmaashon kaa purana shagal rahaa he
 But what if the kidnapped person is killed before the ransom? The kidnapping of a 13-year-old child in Delhi is similar
 pehle is bachche ko agava kiya jaataa he, phir ek karod rupye kii phiroti maangi jaati he
 But before the family members are told where to pay the ransom, the miscreants kill the innocent
 aakhir kyon?purvi dilli ke gandhi nagar ke jane-maane jeweler mukesh verma ke 13 saal kaa betaa utkarsh rahasyamayi tareeke se gaayab ho chukaa tha
 He went to school on this day as usual, but did not return
 gharavaalon ke saath-saath aas-paas ke tamaam log bhi pareshaan the
 Meanwhile, Utkarsh's father Mukesh received a call and came to know that his child had been kidnapped
 kidanaparon ne 1 karod rupee kii phiroti maangi
 The family had already informed the police
 lihaaja, police ne is mobile phone ko trek karne kii koshish kii
 But before the police got any success in this, this number was switched off
 police ne bachche ke skool se waapas aane se lekar gaayab hone kii tak kii puri detail khangaalane kii shuruyaat kii
 The police first questioned the van driver in which Utkarsh used to return from school
 
 
 is shaks ne bataaya ki usne rose kii tarah is din bhi bachche ko uski gali se tii point par dopaher takiranab sava do bache utaar diya tha
 
 
 And as the child moved towards his house on foot, he went ahead
 lekin iske baad utkarsh ghar nahin pahunchaa
 That is, it became clear that someone had abducted Utkarsh from the street just in front of the house
 lekin ye koun ho saktaa tha? kyonki agar kisi ne utkarsh ko is bheed-bhaad vaali gali se jabardastee uthaaya hota, to wo jarur virodh karata
 In such a situation, the child may not have been abducted or the red-handed attempters would have been caught
 yani jo duusari baat takreeban saaf ho chali thi, wo ye ki ho naa ho utkarsh ko kisi jaananevaale ne hi agava kiya tha
 That means someone who knew the Varma family and Utkarsh closely
 ab police ne aparankarta kii tasviir dekhne ke liye gali main lage tamaam sisitivi camaron kii footage khangaalane kii shuruyaat kar di
 But in this too he did not get any special success
 ab gharavaalon ke saath-saath police ko badmaashon ke agali kol kaa intjaar tha
 So that the matter could go ahead and attempt to release Utkarsh
 apharan ke baad katl ke is maamle main police ne jab gunaahagaaron ke chehre se nakaab hataaya, to sab hairaan rah gaye
 It was just that there was no professional miscreant who kidnapped innocent Utkarsh and killed him, but he was the only two people
 jinamein se ek aksar is bachche ke ghar aayaa karata tha or ye maasoom use ankal kah kar pukaarata tha
 This uncle had made all arrangements to escape from the police, but the location of his mobile phone gave his address
 gandhi nagar se thodi dur gita colony main ek naale ke paas utkarsh kii laash padi mili
 Now all hope of the Verma family was broken
 
 
 puure ilaake main matam pasar chukaa tha
 But why did the kidnappers kill Utkarsh? That too when a deal of one crore rupees was going on with his family
 lekin is sawaal kaa jawaab jaanane ke liye police ko kaatilon tak pahunchnaa zaruri tha
 So the police continued the investigation and in this effort, the police got the first success when they found the mobile phone of such a person active at the exact place where Utkarsh's body was disposed
 ye tha 22 saal kaa noujvaan pratap singh, peshey se civil contractor or kol centre kaa kaam karanevaala
 Pratap Singh's father had built the house of the Varma family and both families had good acquaintance
 pratap kaa verma parivaar main aana-janaa bhi laga rahata tha
 Now the police, without losing time, first picked up Pratap Singh and questioned him
 pehle to usne police ko chakaane kii koshish kii, lekin wo jald hi tut gaya or usne kubul kar liya ki usne hi apane ek dost siddharth ke saath milakar utkarsh ko agava kiya tha
 Siddharth used to do mobile phone repairing work
 ab police ne siddharth ko bhi dabocha or donon se poochtacha shuru kii
 Both told that in the greed to become rich overnight, they kidnapped Utkarsh and extortion was the only motive
 balki isse pehle pratap to apane hi ek kajan ko agava karnaa chahataa tha, lekin ain maukey par unhone plan badal liya
 Pratap and Siddharth kidnap Utkarsh on Scooty and the bike, giving him false news of his grandmother's death and take him directly to the flat in Pratap's Angad Nagar, where his girl friend lives
 bachche ko jab baat samaj main ai to wo rone laga
 And as Utkarsh was crying, the nervousness of the two was growing
 police kii maane to is bich pratap ke garlfrand ne maajaraa samajhane kii koshish kii, to donon ne use duusare kamare main band kar diya
 Pratap had also sent Siddharth to Utkarsh's house to sense the atmosphere, but there was a huge crowd
 ye dekh kar donon or tanaav main aa gaye
 After this, both of them called Utkarsh's father twice and also talked about the money
 lekin donon ko pole khul jane kii phikr lagaataar sata rahi thi kyonki utkarsh lagaataar ro rahaa tha
 He also knew Pratap very well from above
 isliye unhone utkarsh ko maut ke ghat utaar diya

 Greenpeace India on Saturday alleged that the Ministry of Home Affairs was creating 'emergency' situations
 sanstha ne yah bhi daawa kiya ki uske ‘manamaane’ kadamon se bharat ke liye antarrashtriya str par sharmasaar karne vaali sthiti bani he
 Reacting to the action against the Ford Foundation, Greenpeace India said that these steps by the government would 'undermine' India's position in the global community of democratic countries
 sanstha ne kaha ki uske samaksh bharat main sanstha ko band karne kaa ‘bahut vaastavik khatra’ utpann ho gaya he or uske sabhi khate band kar die gaye hai
 Executive Director of Green Peace India, Samith h said, 'we are already saying that the Home Ministry's attempt to suppress the opposing voices is against the things in which Indian democracy stands
 grih mantralay apatkaal jaisi sthiti utpann kar rahaa he or bhartiya samaaj sarkaar ke ‘mere paksh main bolo anyathaa apana rasta napo’ vaale ravaiye par sawaal uthaane ke liye ek saath aa gaya he

 mumbai main sadakon par bane gaddhon ne ab tak 5 logon kii jaan le lee he
 In this case, Maharashtra Government Minister Chandrakant Patil made a controversial statement saying that only the pit is not responsible for the accidents
 saarvajanik baandhkam mantri tathaa rajasav mantri chandrakant patil ne kaha ki is raste se kareeb 5 lakh log gujarey honge, isliye sadak haadason main sara dosha raaston kaa nahin bataaya ja saktaa
 He made this statement while speaking to reporters in Sangli
 patil ne kaha ki mumbai city kii sadaken mumbai mahapalika kii jimmedaari hai, vahaan unki satta he or unhen hi is baat kii chintaa kerani chaiye
 He said that all the roads made in Maharashtra are made of tar (tar) on a large scale and it is natural that the roads made of Dambar are spoiled due to the water
 ab sabhi jagahon par cement- kancreet kii sadaken banaai ja rahi hai
 National highways are also being built with concrete, there are no pits in it for 10-12 years
 mumbai main sabase jaada barish hoti he or is saal bhi hui jissesadaken kharabahuin
 The reason is that these bad paths were not repaired
 mumbai main hui 5 mauton par unhone kaha ki ghatnaon ke anusaar unako di jane vaali madad kaa nirnay hoga, magar us raste se 5 lakh log gayi honge or sara dosha raste kaa hi nahin he
 If the blame is on the way, then the engineer and construction agency will be processed and the families of those killed will be given assistance

 The Bofors' genie will once again be opened or put on hold, this is a big question because after 13 years the CBI has applied to reopen the investigation of this famous case of 64 crore scam
 somvaar ko arji par tees hajaari court main sunwaayee honi thi
 The hearing has been postponed to September 28 due to several important documents and records related to the case in the Supreme Court
 court ne sibiai se kaha ki pehle vah ricards or dastavej tees hajaari court main pesh kiye jaaenge or court unhen dekhne ke baad agar santusht hota he to phir yah tay kiya jayega ki is maamle ko dobaaraa kholaa jaae yaa nahin
 Bofors Case: Supreme Court asks CBI, why not appeal for 12 years? CBI has made this application in Tis Hazari Court of Delhi saying that it has some documents which are very important in this case
 haalanki sibiai ke daawey main kitna vajan he yah agali kuch sunwaayee ke dauraan court main saaf ho jayega
 But the CBI says that on the basis of new evidence, it has taken this decision after talking to Attorney General KK Venugopal
 gauratlab he ki 1986 main 1437 karod rupee ke boforce top saude main kathith taur par 64 karod rupee kii dallali dene kaa aarope he

 There are 8 classrooms in two rooms, two teachers sitting in a room, students are not in school, there is a school in Vaishali district of Table Bibihar which runs in only two rooms and in these rooms children from class 1 to 8 are studying
 We do
 hairaani tab or zyada hoti he jab ek hi blike board par 2 shikshak ek saath do kaksha ke chaatro ko padhaate hai
 The Government Middle School located in Basanta Tola village of Lalganj area of vaishali, just 40 kilometers from the capital Patna, has been running in only two rooms for the last several years
 in do kamaron main kaksha 1 se 8 tak ke takreeban 250 bachche ek saath padhai karte hai
 Talking about resources, children from class 1 to 4 are the unlucky as they do not have a table and chair to sit in school
 in 4 kakshaon ke chaatro ko hameshaa skool aane se pehle apane baithne kaa intjaam bhi saath lekar aana padataa he yani ki ghar se yah sabhi chaatr ek bori saath aate hai jise jameen par bichhaakar padhai karte hai
 When Aaj Tak's team reached the school, it was found that the two-room school is occupied by children from class 5 to 6, class 7 to 8
 aise main kaksha 1 se 2 ke chaatro ke paas ek hi vikalp bachataa he or wo ye ki kaksha 1 se 2 te chaatro ko do kamaron ke baahar baraamde par hi bori bicha kar padhai karnaa
 The verandah and land here is the class room of these children
 ek chaatr ne kaha, 'hamaare paas class main baithne ke liye bench or teble nahin he
 This is why we have to bring a bag to sit from home
 'skool kaa donon cameraa phul or baramada bhi phul, aise main kaksha 3 se 4 ke bacchon ke liye skool ke paas ek chota sa cameraa he jo inke liye aavantit he
 In this small room, children of classes 3 to 4 sit on the ground and study
 barish kaa mausam hone ke kaaran jis jagah par bachche baith kar padhai karte hai vahaan jalajmav bhi dekhne ko mila
 Now the question arises that how did waterlogging happen in this room, then understand the reason for this
 darasal is kamare kaa chat puri tareeke se tuuti hui he jisaki vajah se barish kaa pani lagaataar kamare main girtaa rahata he or jalajmav ke bich hi bachche baithkar padhai karte hai
 There is no room for doors and windows in the room, but there is neither door nor windows
 baat kii jaae ab kaksha 5 or 6 ke bacchon kii
 In the same class, on one side where 5 v children sit, on the other side children of VI sit
 class room chota hone kii vajah se teble or bench lagane kii dikkat he jisaki vajah se kuch log blike board kii taraf dekh kar padhai karte hai to koi duusari disha main baithkar
 The condition of classes 7 and 8 is the most shocking
 jahaan ek hi class room main blike board par do teacher do alag-alag vishay padhaate hue dekhe gaye
 The condition of this classroom was so bad that the children of seventh and eighth have not been seated separately
 sab ek saath samooh banaakar is class room main baithte hai or kanphyus hote rahete hai ki aakhir kis vishay ke bare main jaankaree len
 When Aajtak's team reached this room, it was seen that teacher Ramanuj Prasad was teaching general science to the children of class 7, while in another part of the black board, teacher named Richa Kumari was teaching mathematics to the children of class VIII
 is class main bhi aadhe bachche blike board kii taraf dekh kar padhai karte hai to aadhe duusari disha main dekhakar
 Ramanuj Prasad teacher said, 'there is a lot of resources in the school due to which we have to teach children in this way
 'yah dekhakar or hairaani hui jab pataa chalaa ki skool main bijli kaa conection to he magar kisi bhi kamare main pankhaa tak nahin laga hua he
 Children have to sit in class and study without fan during summer season
 richaa kumari shikshika ne kaha, 'skool main naa to bijli he naa pankhaa he
 We have given this information many times to our officials, but still no hearing
 ham isi tareeke se padhaane ke liye majaboor he
 We have a lot of trouble

 In such a situation, Shahbano whose demand for allowance was also approved by the Supreme Court, could not get anything for his survival
 aapako yaad dilaa den aaj se 32 saal pehle bhi is masale par supreme court ne faisalaa sunaaya tha or sarkaar ko sansad main is faisale ko badalanaa padaa tha
 It is a different matter that the matter was not related to the legal or non-legal side of divorce, but the maintenance of allowances, but it can be said that in independent India, this fight was for the rights of Muslim women, which Shahbano fought

 You scare him, we scare him
 kyon kisi ko lagata he ki inkaa, unka raaj aayega to ham par qayaamat tuutegi
 The answer is simple
 kisi kaa bhi raaj ho, logon ke man main ek baat saaf he, thana-police par janata kaa raaj nahin hota he
 The police of the police station is always the one who rules
 agar hamaare mulk main peshewar police prashasan hota to log bhay kii raajnneeti ke shikaar na hote

 Will go even then
 samasya jangalraj or dangaraaj se he to iske prati zaraa eemaandaaree se sochie
 Only political parties benefit from this
 donon darpok se to acha he us garib kaa dar jo aaj bhi raajnneeti ko amir or garib ke chashme se dekh rahaa he
 The middle and elite section of Patna is scared of Jungle Raj
 yah dar kai tabake main swaabhaavik taur par bhi he
 But why is this fear not in the poorer sections? patna main bijepi mukhyalay ke thik saamne aath-das rickshawvaalon ke saath chaay pi rahaa tha
 They asked the same question that if Jungle Raj came
 ek ne tad se jawaab diya ki hamaare liye to puunjipati kaa raaj bhi jangalraj he
 The BJP is the party of the bourgeoisie
 kheni banaate hue uske munh se puunjipati shabd kaa nikalnaa hairaan kar gaya
 The second voice came that if the secret of the poor comes, everyone thinks of Jungle Raj
 in teenon prasangon kaa saamaajik vishleshan hona chahie
 What does fear mean in different sections? bijepi ke aane se koun daraa hua he or nitish-lalu ke aane se koun
 Both streams represent fear
 ye or baat he ki ek kism ke bhay ko zyaada mukharata mili he or ek kism kaa bhay media ke vimarsh se gaayab he magar dadri kii ghatana ke baad ghar kar gaya he
 Have our political parties divided the politics of fear? tum isko daraao, ham usko daraate hai
 Why does anyone think that if they get their rule, then doom will break on us
 jawaab saadhaaran he
 Whatever may be the rule, one thing is clear in the minds of the people, the police-police station is not ruled by the people
 thana police hameshaa uski hoti he, jiskaa raaj hota he
 If we had a professional police administration in our country, people would not have fallen prey to the politics of fear
 zaahir he police par na to oonchi jati ke doctor ko bharosa he na muslim noujvaan ko
 No party government implemented police reforms
 police ke kaam main raajnneetik dakhlandaazi ko samaapt karne kii pahal nahin kii
 Kiran Bedi and former UP Director General of Police Parkash Singh used to talk a lot about police reform during the 2014 elections
 ab ye donon aise chup hai jaise police sudhaar kaa kaam pachaas saal pehle ho gaya ho
 People were also given political allegiance to the matter of police reform
 na aam janata maang karti he, na khaas janata
 Now i want to say something to the Muslim youth and the doctor couple
 pehle muslim noujvaan se
 Take a closer look
 saikadon-hazaron kii sankhya main musmalaan hotel chalaa rahe hai
 Doing small business
 bihar main hi kai muslim ladakon se mila, jinaki apni companiyaan hai
 The head of the hamlet village of Siwan runs the company in Calcutta
 sabhi mobile companiyon kaa tower lagaataa he lekin wo apane gaanv kaa mukhiya isliye banane aa gaya taaki wo kuch kar sake
 Should all of them be afraid that the bjp's rule will come
 bijepi ko zarur sochna chahie ki baithe-bithaae wo in naujavaanon ke dar ko kyon badha rahi he
 Although BJP does not have a direct role, the reason for fear is being linked to it like BJP connects Nitish and Lalu with fear
 doctor sahab se yah kahana he ki aap apane peshey ke bheetar ke raaj ko dekhiye

 unke peshey ke bheetar kaa jangalraj lalu ke samay bhi tha, nitish ke samay to phala-phula hi or bijepi ke raaj main bhi rahegaa
 If they are honest about Jungle Raj, then look within themselves and their profession to see if they have not made Jungle Raj
 garib marizon ko kis tarah se lutaa ja rahaa he ye koun doctor nahin jaanata he
 Do not unnecessarily air Jungle Raj

 Why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi share the stage with Sajayfta Surajbhan Singh at a Munger rally
 'purv saansad surajbhaan singh ji' jaise aadarsuchak shabdon kaa istamaal kyon kiya? surajbhaan singh kis cote se manch par bithaae gaye
 By race or criminal record quota
 kya jangalraj ke daur main surajbhaan janaseva kar rahe the? aaj ke indian express main khabar chhapi he ki argedy ke purv saansad or sazaayaftaa shahabuddin jail se hi apana raajnneetik samrajya chalaa rahe hai
 What is the difference between Surajbhan and Shahabuddin
 agar log jangalraj yaa dangaraaj ko lekar itane hi eemaandaar hai to ve un logon ko vot kyon dete hai jinka aapraadhik record rahaa he
 Is Doctor Saheb and those Muslim youth able to see both these situations
 tippaniyan Therefore, find out the reasons for the politics of fear
 chunakar suvidha or jati-dharm ke hisaab se antar karnaa band kiijie
 Neither one needs to close their hotel nor leave Bihar to go to London
 rahi behatar padhai, degree, or naukari ke liye baahar jane kii baat to iske liye bahaanaa mat banaaie
 People will go to Howard even if Jungle Raj is not there
 hoga tab bhi jaaenge
 If the problem is with Jangraj and Dangaraj, then think honestly about it
 isse phayda sirf raajnneetik dalon ko hi hota he
 Both of them are better than the coward, fear of the poor who is still seeing politics through the glasses of rich and poor
 in teenon prasangon kaa saamaajik vishleshan hona chahie
 What does fear mean in different sections? bijepi ke aane se koun daraa hua he or nitish-lalu ke aane se koun
 Both streams represent fear
 ye or baat he ki ek kism ke bhay ko zyaada mukharata mili he or ek kism kaa bhay media ke vimarsh se gaayab he magar dadri kii ghatana ke baad ghar kar gaya he
 Have our political parties divided the politics of fear? tum isko daraao, ham usko daraate hai
 Why does anyone think that if they get their rule, then doom will break on us
 jawaab saadhaaran he
 Whatever may be the rule, one thing is clear in the minds of the people, the police-police station is not ruled by the people
 thana police hameshaa uski hoti he, jiskaa raaj hota he
 If we had a professional police administration in our country, people would not have fallen prey to the politics of fear
 zaahir he police par na to oonchi jati ke doctor ko bharosa he na muslim noujvaan ko
 No party government implemented police reforms
 police ke kaam main raajnneetik dakhlandaazi ko samaapt karne kii pahal nahin kii
 Kiran Bedi and former UP Director General of Police Parkash Singh used to talk a lot about police reform during the 2014 elections
 ab ye donon aise chup hai jaise police sudhaar kaa kaam pachaas saal pehle ho gaya ho
 People were also given political allegiance to the matter of police reform
 na aam janata maang karti he, na khaas janata
 Now i want to say something to the Muslim youth and the doctor couple
 pehle muslim noujvaan se
 Take a closer look
 saikadon-hazaron kii sankhya main musmalaan hotel chalaa rahe hai
 Doing small business
 bihar main hi kai muslim ladakon se mila, jinaki apni companiyaan hai
 The head of the hamlet village of Siwan runs the company in Calcutta
 sabhi mobile companiyon kaa tower lagaataa he lekin wo apane gaanv kaa mukhiya isliye banane aa gaya taaki wo kuch kar sake
 Should all of them be afraid that the bjp's rule will come
 bijepi ko zarur sochna chahie ki baithe-bithaae wo in naujavaanon ke dar ko kyon badha rahi he
 Although BJP does not have a direct role, the reason for fear is being linked to it like BJP connects Nitish and Lalu with fear
 doctor sahab se yah kahana he ki aap apane peshey ke bheetar ke raaj ko dekhiye
 How ambulances deal on the Ganges Bridge and nursing homes are robbing patients
 unke peshey ke bheetar kaa jangalraj lalu ke samay bhi tha, nitish ke samay to phala-phula hi or bijepi ke raaj main bhi rahegaa
 If they are honest about Jungle Raj, then look within themselves and their profession to see if they have not made Jungle Raj
 garib marizon ko kis tarah se lutaa ja rahaa he ye koun doctor nahin jaanata he

 Why did Prime Minister Narendra Modi share the stage with Sajayfta Surajbhan Singh at a Munger rally

 Both of them are better than the coward, fear of the poor who is still seeing politics through the glasses of rich and poor
 kyon kisi ko lagata he ki inkaa, unka raaj aayega to ham par qayaamat tuutegi
 The answer is simple
 kisi kaa bhi raaj ho, logon ke man main ek baat saaf he, thana-police par janata kaa raaj nahin hota he
 The police of the police station is always the one who rules
 agar hamaare mulk main peshewar police prashasan hota to log bhay kii raajnneeti ke shikaar na hote
 It is evident that neither the upper caste doctors trust the police nor the Muslim youth
 kisi bhi party kii sarkaar ne police sudhaar ko lagu nahin kiya
 Did not take the initiative to end political interference in police work
 2014 ke chunaav ke samay kiran bedi or upi ke purv police mahanideshak prakaash singh police sudhaar kii kaaphi baaten karte thea
 Now both of them are silent as if police reform work was done fifty years ago
 police sudhaar ke maamle ko bhi logon ne raajnneetik nishtha kii bhent chadha diya
 Neither the general public demands nor the particular public
 ab main muslim noujvaan or doctor danpati se kuch kahana chahta hum
 First Muslim youth
 aap zaraa nazar ghuma kar dekhie
 Hundreds of thousands of Muslims run the hotel
 chota-motaa kaarobaar kar rahe hai
 In Bihar itself, i met many Muslim boys who owned their own companies
 sivaan ke hathaudaa gaanv kaa mukhiya kalakatta main company chalaata he
 All mobile companies have towers, but they have come to become the head of their village so that they can do something
 kya un sabko dar janaa chahie ki bijepi kaa raaj aa jayega
 BJP must think that why is it increasing the fear of these young people sitting
 bhale sidhe taur par bijepi kii koi bhoomika na ho, lekin bhay kaa kaaran usase joda ja rahaa he jaise bijepi, nitish or lalu ko bhay se jodatii he
 It is to say to the doctor that you look at the secret within your profession
 kis tarah se ganga brij par ambulance kaa sauda hota he or nursing home marizon ko lut rahe hai
 The jungle within his profession was also during Lalu's time, flourished at the time of Nitish and will remain under BJP rule
 agar ve jangalraj ko lekar eemaandaar hai to phir apane or apane peshey ke bheetar jhankkar dekhen ki kya un logon ne jangalraj nahin banaaya he
 Who does not know how the poor patients are being robbed? bevajaah jangalraj ko hawa na den
 If we were really honest about Jungle Raj or Dangaraj, then there is no difference between the two
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne munger kii raily main sazaayaftaa surajbhaan singh ke saath manch saajha kyon kiya
 Why did you use respectful words like 'former MP Surajbhan Singh Ji'? From which quota Surajbhan Singh was placed on the stage
 jati yaa aapraadhik record ke cote se
 Was Surajbhan serving in the era of Jungle Raj? Today's Indian Express has reported that former RJD MP and Shajafta Shahabuddin is running his political empire from jail
 surajbhaan or shahabuddin main kya antar he
 If people are equally honest about Jungle Raj or Dangaraj then why do they vote for those who have criminal records
 kya doctor sahab or wo muslim noujvaan in donon sthitiyon ko dekh paa rahe hai
 The comments isliye bhay kii raajnneeti ke kaarnon kaa pataa lagaaie
 Choose and stop differentiating according to convenience and caste and religion
 na to kisi ko apana hotel band karne kii zarurat he or na hi bihar chhodkar landan jane kii
 For better studies, degrees, and going out for a job, don't make excuses for this
 jangalraj nahin hoga tab bhi log harvard jaaenge padhane
 Will go even then
 samasya jangalraj or dangaraaj se he to iske prati zaraa eemaandaaree se sochie

 Talking about the hope, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday asked Pakistan to take forward the progress made in the investigation of Mumbai terror attack and investigate various accused involved in it, including Jamaat-ud Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed
 maamle main kuch pragati hui hasingh ne ek samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki mumbai aatanki hamale main kuch pragati hui he or pehali baar pakistan isse sahamat hua he ki mumbai ghatana kii sajeesh vahiin rachi gayi
 He said, "the pressure from us and the international community has been affected
 pehali baar pakistan sahamat hua he ki mumbai hamale kii sajeesh pakistan main rachi gayi or ghatana main uske naagarik shaamil the
 The Prime Minister said that Pakistan had never agreed to this before
 unka hameshaa kahana tha ki uskaa isse koi lenadena nahin he or isamen uske log shaamil nahin the
 We have not given up hope
 The Prime Minister said that Pakistan should investigate all those involved in it, including lashkar-e-taiba founder Hafiz Saeed and terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 unhone kaha ‘‘nishpaksh sunwaayee ho jiske aadhaar par uchit dand mili
 We have not given up hope
 ’’ pados kii sthiti par unhone kaha ‘‘pados se hamaare desh main pahunch rahe aatankwaad ke nateezon se nipatane ke liye hamen paryaapt taiyaari kerani hogi
 "we are taking all necessary steps in that direction, but still my belief is that the government and the people especially Pakistan should understand that the protection of terrorist groups has caused a big loss to the South Asian region," he said

 # Manmarziyaan Understood perfectly by @shubhrashetty what say xxrep 4 ! ?!A post shared by Taapsee Pannu (@taapsee) on Mar 12, 2018 at 12:02am PDT Speaker of Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly Kodela Shiv Prasad Rao has given a controversial statement about women
 unhone do din pehle ek press vaarta main kaha ki mahilaon ko gharon tak hi simit rakhaa jaae to unke saath rape nahin hoga
 However, he later clarified that women should take steps to protect themselves (martial arts etc
)
 tippaniyan According to media reports, Kodela, the Telugu Desam Party leader and speaker of the assembly, compared the women to the car and said that if the car is bought and put in the garage, then there is no fear of accident
 aisa pehle samay main hota tha jab mahilaayein ghar main rahati thim or kai tarah ke julmon se bhi mahfuj rahati thim
 But today when she goes out in writing, the risk of molestation and rape etc
 has increased
 agar vah ghar se na nikalatin to aisa khatra nahin rahata
 However later when he realized that he had spoken wrong, he said that i did not mean to keep women at home
 unhen padhanaa-likhnaa or naukari kerani chahie lekin apni hifaazat ke liye khud bhi kadam uthaane chahie
 Just making laws will do nothing
 media main chhapi khabaron ke anusaar- telugu desham party ke netaa or vidhansabha spikar kodela ne mahilaon kii tulana car se karte hue kaha ki agar car ko kharidkar gairaaj main rakh diya jaae to accident kaa dar nahin rahata
 This used to happen in earlier times when women used to stay at home and also protected from many kinds of atrocities
 lekin aaj vah pard likhakar baahar jaati hai to chhedchhad or rape aadi ghatnaon kaa khatra zyada bad gaya he
 If she does not leave the house, there is no such danger
 haalanki baad main jab unhen ahsaas hua ki vah galat bol gaye hai to unhone kaha ki meraa matlab mahilaon ko ghar main rakhane se nahin tha
 They should read, write and do jobs but should also take steps to protect themselves
 sirf kanoon banane se kuch nahin hoga
 However later when he realized that he had spoken wrong, he said that i did not mean to keep women at home
 unhen padhanaa-likhnaa or naukari kerani chahie lekin apni hifaazat ke liye khud bhi kadam uthaane chahie

 @imbhuvi @shikhardofficial @kedarjadhavofficiala post shared by Hardik Pandya (@hardikpandya93) on Jun 27, 2017 at 10:03am PDT One study said that every year women lose their three weeks of sleep only because their husbands snore
 nishchit rup se yah aisa adhyayan he, jisase kai mahilaon ko koi aashcharya nahin hoga
 a survey conducted on a total of 2,500 adults has found that snoring is a nightmare to the extent that 39 percent of wives move to another room to sleep peacefully
 survey ke mutabik, nau jodon main ek joda keval kharrate kii samasya kii vajah se sthaayee rup se alag-alag sota he
 According to the news published in the Daily Mail, the interesting thing is that not only men are responsible for the snoring habit, women also snore fiercely
 haalanki yah samasya aam taur par purushon main hi hoti he
 Data from the British Lung Foundation shows that 39 per cent of adults lose an average of one and a half hours of sleep a night due to the problem of snoring
 ek saal main iskaa kul yoga 574 ghante yaa kareeb 23 din hota he
 Soon after the sweeping victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has started a campaign to strengthen the organization

 Shivraj Singh Chauhan, bjp's national vice president and membership campaign in-charge at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, on Sunday formally launched the campaign in the presence of organization minister Ramlal and BJP Delhi president Manoj Tiwari
 is avasar par shivaraj singh chouhan ne loksabhaa chunaav kaa zikr karte hue jin boothon par bijepi peeche rah gai thi, un boothon par bhi aage nikalne ko lakshya bataaya
 bjp's organization minister Ramlal expressed his commitment to strengthen every booth and said that a target has been set to get 50 per cent votes in each court
 vahiin pradesh adhyaksh tiwari ne kaha ki dilli main 20 lakh nae sadasyon ko party se jodne kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya he
 He said that at present the party has a membership of 30 lakhs in the state of Delhi

 Among those joining the BJP are Divyang Vikram Bhatt, who has also been mentioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his radio program Mann Ki Baat

 Tiwari said that Priyanka Gandhi had tweeted the photo of photo Sapna, claiming that she was going to join Congress

 Significantly, the news of joining the Congress was misunderstood by Sapna
 sapana loksabhaa chunaav ke liye bijepi ummidavaaron ke namakan main bhi shaamil hui thim or prachaar bhi kiya tha
 Since then, there was speculation that he would formally join the BJP

 Finance Minister P
 chidambaram somvaar, 17 farvari, ko antarim bajet pesh karenge
 While there is no expectation of any significant changes in direct, indirect taxes in this budget, there is definitely curiosity about the fiscal and economic picture to be presented in it
 aam chunaav se pehle ke antarim bajet main sarkaar varsh 2014-15 ke liye aamadani or kharche kaa ek motaa anumaan rakhane ke saath-saath sansad se nae vitt ke pehle chaar maah ke kharche kii anumati maangegi
 4 of the fiscal deficit in the budget of april-march 2013-14
 8 fisadi tak simit rakhane kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 However, this target seems challenging given the economic softening and increasing subsidy bill
 chidambaram vishwaas jataate aa rahe hai ki yah ghaataa upar nahin jayega
 According to experts, there is no possibility of any change in the key rates of personal and company tax
 lekin apratyaksh karon ke kshetra main jarurat dikhne par thode bahut aise sanshodhan kiye ja sakate hai, jinamein kanoon sanshodhan kii jarurat nahin ho
 Chidambaram has also given such signs
 unhone sansad ke chaalu satr kii purv sandhya par kaha tha ki antarim bajet main, 'ham iskar adhinium yaa utpaada-shulk adhinium main sanshodhan kaa prastaav nahin kar sakate
 But any proposal other than amendment of any law can be made
 ' The Finance Minister had said on a question that without the change in the law on excise or service tax, whatever changes needed to be done have been done and will be done
 ' According to financial affairs expert and chartered accountant KK Mittal, "better than expected revenue in the 2G spectrum auction has made the finance minister's path easier, but the high subsidy bill still remains a concern
" ' Sources associated with Prashant Kishore, who is holding the post of advisor to the Chief Minister in Bihar, say that the election strategist has decided to file a defamation suit against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushil Kumar Modi in the state
 mangalvaar ko susheel kumaar modi ne kaha tha ki prashanth kishor ko lagbhag nau karod rupee kii raashi kaa bhugtan kiya gaya he, taaki vah bihar ke vikaas ke liye nai vistrut yojana taiyaar karen, or uskaa prachaar bhi karen
 The BJP leader said that the money was paid to 39-year-old Prashant Kishore through a registered firm 'citizens Alliance Private Limited' in Noida near Delhi

 According to sources, the Citizens Alliance was scrapped after the 2014 general election, and Prashant Kishore has nothing to do with it now

 "sushil Modi pointed to Prashant Kishore's absence from Bihar for a long time, as he is serving the Congress party for the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh assembly elections in the meantime
 bijepi netaa ne kaha, "yaa kishor ko khud mukhyamantri ke salaahkaar pad se istipha de dena chahie, yaa mukhyamantri ko unhen is mahatvapurn pad se hataa dena chahie

 Nitish Kumar was also criticized by the BJP for running it as a government program, whereas it was an exercise to connect people before the vote
 prashanth kishor ke sahaayakon ne naam nahin chhapane kii shart par kaha ki us abhiyaan main kharch kii gai rakam do fermon ko di gai thi, jinka prashanth kishor se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 In November last year, Nitish Kumar was elected the chief minister of the state for the third consecutive time, and during the assembly elections he took Prashant Kishore for his campaign
 isamen sabase dilachasp baat yah thi ki varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan prashanth kishor bijepi ke saath the, or pradhanmantri kii kursi tak narendra modi ko pahunchane main unka kaaphi yogadan mana jaataa he

 On Tuesday, Sushil Kumar Modi said that Prashant Kishore had been paid an amount of about nine crore rupees, so that he could prepare a new detailed plan for the development of Bihar, and also promote it
 bijepi netaa ne kaha ki 39-varshiya prashanth kishor ko is rakam kaa bhugtan dilli ke nikat noida main register kii gai form 'citizans elliance privet limited' ke zariye kiya gaya
 Sources close to Prashant Kishore say that the defamation claim will emphasize that although Prashant helped set up the Citizens Alliance as a non-profit policy group in 2013, he is now another non- Profit organizations work through the I-PAC or the Indian Political Action Committee
 sutron ke anusaar, varsh 2014 main hue aam chunaav ke baad citizans elliance ko khatm kar diya gaya tha, or ab prashanth kishor kaa usase koi lenaa-dena nahin he

 " unhone kaha ki mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ko yah zarur bataanaa chahie ki prashanth kishor ne pichley aath maheenon ke dauraan sarkaar ko kya yogadan diya he
 Prashant Kishore's assistants say that the nine crores of rupees the BJP is referring to were spent on the 'badh Chala Bihar' campaign before the election, under which 40,000 gram sabhas were organized and information was gathered
 What people expect the government to pay attention to
 nitish kumaar kii is baat ke liye bhi bijepi ne aalochana kii thi ki unhone ise sarkari kaarykram kii tarah chalaaya, jabaki yah matdaan se pehle logon se judane ke liye karwaai gai kavayad thi
 Prashant Kishore's assistants, on the condition of anonymity, said that the money spent in that campaign was given to two firms, which have nothing to do with Prashant Kishore

 The most interesting thing in this was that Prashant Kishore was with the BJP during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, and he is considered to have contributed a lot in bringing Narendra Modi to the Prime Minister's chair
 tippaniyan Prashant Kishore is said to have joined hands with Nitish Kumar in June last year for not keeping track of BJP president Amit Shah, who has been among the bjp's most vehement opponents and critics

 Who is guilty of this madness of Muzaffarnagar? Who should be held accountable for this? How will they be judged? And how can such violence be stopped? Throughout the history of communal riots, the courts, jurists and scholars of the country have always been familiar with such questions
 lekin inke jawaab aasaan nahin hai
 Now the UPA government is bringing a Communal Violence and Targeted Violence Prevention Bill in response
 5 disambar se shuru ho rahe sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main is vidheyak ko pesh karne kii yojana he
 The bill provides for holding government officials accountable for their behavior as the cause of communal violence

 However, this is also being brought at a time when communal tension is increasing
 is saal abhi tak desh main sampradayik tanaav kii 451 vaaradaaten ho chuki hai
 The proposed bill was first introduced in 2005 as the Communal Violence Prevention, Control and Victim Rehabilitation Bill
 tab iskaa majamoon gujarat dangon ko dhyaan main rakhkar taiyaar kiya gaya tha or uskaa zikr 2004 main congress ke ghoshnaa-patr main bhi tha

 After that Bill remained in cold storage

 a jail sentence of up to 10 years has been provided
 mandar kehete hai, ‘‘pehle vaale vidheyak main yah mana gaya tha ki rajyon ke paas hinsa se nibatane ke paryaapt adhikaar nahin hai, isliye usamen un adhikaron kii baat thi

 Sociologist Dipankar Gupta argues that the problem is not with the police and government officials not doing duties properly, but with the leaders who instigated the riots

 If an effective law is to be enacted, then the system of the leaders will also have to be investigated

 sadan ke bheetar sirf dhoti pahanakar aane se pataa nahin kyon kuch sadasyon ko laga ki sadan kii garima chali gai
 Millions of poor women and men of the country wrap only dhoti

 In my opinion, it was absolutely right
 to kya yah maan liya jaae ki bijepi ke vidhayak ne surkiyon main aane ke liye aisa kiya
 We often call our democracy great
 ye thik bhi he lekin mahanata ke bakhaan ke chakkar main ham kaaphi satahi ho jate hai
 For example, is Indian democracy so successful that elections are held here and people vote
 kai baar ham is baat ko aise rekhaankit karne lagate hai jaise duniya main kahin chunaav nahin ho paata he
 There is no voting
 aisa bhi nahin ki ham isaki kamiyon par baat nahin karte
 We do a lot but talking has become like consumption

 You must have known the story of these three trucks by now
 tamilnadu vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan pakade gaye the

 sirf 570 karod rupee baraamad hue the
 It was feared that these notes were being taken for distribution in elections
 chunaav ayog kii team ne pakad liya or maamla adaalat main pahunchaa
 First State Bank of India has claimed that these money belong to him
 state bank of india ke daawa karne ke baad bhi maamla abhi tak nahin sulajhaa he
 Many kinds of things are coming out
 pehla trek ke number farzi hai
 Documents submitted by the Reserve Bank of India for permission to carry such huge amount have also been fake
 noton ke bandal par kisi or bank kaa sil he jabaki state bank daawa kar rahaa he uskaa paisa he
 The Madras High Court has asked the CBI to investigate and file a report within two weeks
 is cese se jude ek vakil kaa kahana he ki saare dastauez bogus hai
 State Bank of India claims to have its money
 tamilnadu kii do vidhansabha siton par diemke or anna diemke ke ummidavaaron kii taraf se karodon rupee baantne ke aarope lage to chunaav radd karne pade
 Election watchers said that a lot of money was distributed
 duniya ke sabase bade loktantr main paise baant kar chunaav bhi jite ja sakate hai
 We have elections here, but we should see how the elections are going and why the money is running
 raajnneeti aaj itani mahangi hoti ja rahi he ki aap garib kii baat to kar sakate hai magar ab garib chunaav nahin jeet saktaa
 If that were the case, some of the poorest of the independent candidates of Rajya Sabha would have come to the field and our mlas would have given their remaining votes influenced by their talk

 You are aware that at present there is an election for 57 seats of Rajya Sabha in 15 states of the country
 6 rajyon main nirdhaarit seat se zyada ummidavaar hai
 It is here that money transactions and political games are being talked about
 kai baar congress bijepi ke vot se seat jeet leti he to kai baar bijepi duusare dalon ke vidhayakon ke vot se
 You will find many examples of this
 zaahir he ye matdaan fokat main nahin hote hai
 Evidence may not be found, but if you ask any leader, then it will say that without money no independents can win
 ummid he bharat ke sabhi dal rajyasabha ko lekar chintit honge agar ve in kaamon main shaamil nahin honge tab
 You must have known the story of these three trucks by now
 tamilnadu vidhansabha chunaavon ke dauraan pakade gaye the
 195 boxes filled with notes were found inside them
 sirf 570 karod rupee baraamad hue the
 It was feared that these notes were being taken for distribution in elections
 chunaav ayog kii team ne pakad liya or maamla adaalat main pahunchaa
 First State Bank of India has claimed that these money belong to him
 state bank of india ke daawa karne ke baad bhi maamla abhi tak nahin sulajhaa he
 Many kinds of things are coming out
 pehla trek ke number farzi hai
 Documents submitted by the Reserve Bank of India for permission to carry such huge amount have also been fake
 noton ke bandal par kisi or bank kaa sil he jabaki state bank daawa kar rahaa he uskaa paisa he
 The Madras High Court has asked the CBI to investigate and file a report within two weeks
 is cese se jude ek vakil kaa kahana he ki saare dastauez bogus hai
 State Bank of India claims to have its money
 tamilnadu kii do vidhansabha siton par diemke or anna diemke ke ummidavaaron kii taraf se karodon rupee baantne ke aarope lage to chunaav radd karne pade
 Election watchers said that a lot of money was distributed
 duniya ke sabase bade loktantr main paise baant kar chunaav bhi jite ja sakate hai
 We have elections here, but we should see how the elections are going and why the money is running
 raajnneeti aaj itani mahangi hoti ja rahi he ki aap garib kii baat to kar sakate hai magar ab garib chunaav nahin jeet saktaa
 If that were the case, some of the poorest of the independent candidates of Rajya Sabha would have come to the field and our mlas would have given their remaining votes influenced by their talk
 kya aisa ho saktaa he
 Find out what is the economic status of all the independents who have entered the Rajya Sabha elections this time
 paise ke dam par rajyasabha kii seat kareedne ke aarope lag rahe hai
 For the upper house of the world's largest democracy
 aapako pataa hi hoga ki karnataka ke ek vidhayak ji kathith rup se paanch karod rupaya maang rahe the
 An FIR has been filed against him but the election has not been canceled
 kai dalon ne duusare dal kaa ummidavaar na jite isliye paise vaale nirdaleey ummidavaar ko khadaa kiya he taaki wo daam dekar kareed le or uskaa ummidavaar haar jaae
 It is not right to take the name of the party because the credit for doing this work goes by turn
 yahi nahin partiyaan apane vidhayakon kii nishtha se bhi pareshaan hai
 They are being closed from hotels to resorts
 rajyasabha kaa chunaav aate hi partiyon ko apane vidhayakon ke upar se bharosa samaapt ho jaataa he
 It is a matter of concern rose ham kisi party ke vidhayakon ko hotel main rakhe jane kii khabaren padhate rahete hai or saamaanya ho jate hai
 The mlas who are elected after the name of the poor are kept in five star hotels with whose money
 2012 main jharkhand main rajyasabha chunaav ke dauraan ek nirdaleey ummidavaar ke bhai kii gaadi se 215 karod rupee chunaav ayog ne pakade the
 This money was being taken to Ranchi to distribute it to the mlas
 kya aap samaj paa rahe hai ki hamaari raajnneeti ke paas 215 karod kahaan se aata he
 Mere election is not a big success of our democracy
 hamen dekhnaa chahie ki hamaari sansthaaen kitni loktantric hai
 How democratic we and you have become
 janata bhi to chunaav se pehle kii raat bant rahe kaala dhan or sharaab ko le leti he
 Have you heard that Hillary Clinton and Trump won the election the night before the election by splitting the liquor
 isliye loktantr ko lalit niabandh kaa vishay mat banaaiye
 Look at its hollowness
 ediaar ke anusaar 542 saansadon main se 185 ke kilaaf aapraadhik maamle chal rahe hai
 Out of 542, 112 mps are facing serious criminal cases
 ediaar kii hi report he ki kerala main 60 pratishat vidhayakon ne inakam tex file nahin kiya he
 The number of such mlas in Bengal is 20 percent
 kya ye sab itane garib honge
 Doesn't this bother you? tippaniyan In the world's largest and greatest democracy, the number of women candidates elected in every election is equal to negligible
 aap jaanate hai ki is vakt desh ke 15 rajyon main rajyasabha kii 57 siton ke liye chunaav he
 6 states have more candidates than the prescribed seats
 yaheen par paise ke lenden or siyaasi khel kii baat ho rahi he
 Many times the Congress wins the seat by the vote of the BJP and sometimes the BJP by the vote of the mlas of other parties
 iske anek udhaaharan aapako milenge
 Obviously these polling does not take place in focus
 pramaan bhale na mili lekin kisi netaa se puuchhiyegaa to yahi kahegaa ki bina paise ke koi nirdaleey jeet hi nahin saktaa
 It is expected that all parties in India will be concerned about the Rajya Sabha if they do not participate in these works
 hamaare yahaan chunaav to ho jate hai magar hamen dekhnaa chahie ki kaise kaise chunaav ho rahe hai or paise paise kyon chal rahe hai
 Politics is becoming so expensive today that you can talk about the poor but now the poor cannot win elections
 agar aisa hota to rajyasabha ke nirdaleey ummidavaaron main se kuch garib bhi maidan main aa jate or hamaare vidhayak log apana bachaa hua mat unki baton se prabhavit hokar de dete
 Can it happen aap pataa kiijie ki jitne bhi nirdaleey is baar rajyasabha ke chunaav main utre hai unki aarthik sthiti kya he
 There are allegations of buying a Rajya Sabha seat on the basis of money
 duniya ke sabase bade loktantr ke ucch sadan ke liye
 You might be aware that a Karnataka MLA was allegedly asking for five crore rupees
 unke khilaaf exiaar to ho gai he magar chunaav radd nahin hua he
 Many parties have not won the candidate of the other party, so they have created an independent candidate with money so that they buy it by paying the price and its candidate loses
 party kaa naam lenaa thik nahin kyonki baari baari se ye kaam karne kaa shrey sabko jaataa he
 Not only this, the parties are also troubled by the loyalty of their mlas
 unhen hotel se lekar resort tak main band rakhaa ja rahaa he
 As soon as the Rajya Sabha elections are over, the parties lose faith in their mlas
 yah kitni chintaa kii baat he
 Every day, we keep reading the news of a party's mlas being kept in the hotel and it becomes normal
 garibon ke naam par chunakar aane vaale vidhayak five star hotalon main kiske paise se rakhe jate hai
 During the Rajya Sabha elections in Jharkhand in 2012, the Election Commission caught Rs 215 crore from the vehicle of an independent candidate's brother
 ye paisa vidhayakon ko baantne ke liye ranchi le jaaya ja rahaa tha
 Do you understand where 215 crore comes from our politics
 sirf chunaav ho janaa hamaare loktantr kii badi kamyaabi nahin he
 We should see how democratic our institutions are
 ham or aap kitne loktantric hue hai
 The public also takes away the black money and liquor distributed on the night before the election
 kya aapane suna he ki hillari clinton or trump chunaav se pehle raat ko daaru baant kar chunaav jeet gaye
 Therefore, do not make democracy the subject of a fine essay

 There is also a provision for no limit on donations received through electoral bonds

 But after consulting extensively with its legal experts, the Commission argues that this will not lead to transparency in donations to political parties

 According to the new provisions, according to the new provisions, transparency will not increase due to non-disclosure of income from bonds received by political parties

 For the last 4 days, there is tension on the border of China adjacent to the northeastern state of Sikkim
 bharat or china kii senaayen aamane-saamne he
 China has accused Indian soldiers of entering the border and stopping road construction work
 chini sena ne bharat ke do banksron ko tod diya or kaha ki ye china kii seemaa main bane hue the
 China is also sending a strong message from Beijing and is constantly accusing the border of disturbing the atmosphere
 ham samajhane kaa prayaas karte hai ki aakhir kya he sikkim main border par vivaad kaa kaaran
 Where did the dispute start? Recently, Indian troops protested against the construction of road in Donglong in Sikkim sector from China
 iske baad chini sainikon ne sikkim sector main bharat ke do banksron ko tod diya
 China is telling it in its border
 bhartiya sainikon ne chini sena kii is karrwai kii virodh kiya
 Since then, thousands of soldiers of both countries are standing face to face
 darasal china border par bharat ne apni taiyaariyaan majboot kii hai
 China is unable to digest the construction work of the Indian Army of the new bunkers in place of the old bunkers and is calling it provocative action
 china kii kya he aapattiyambhartiya bunker hataae jane kii ghatana june ke pehle saptaah main sikkim ke doka laa ilaake main hui jisase sikkim kshetra main bharat-china seemaa par tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 The history of china-india border dispute is quite long
 donon deshon ke bich 3,488 kilometre lambii seemaa he jo jammu-kashmir se lekar arunachal pradesh tak he
 Of this, 220 km falls in Sikkim
 chunki is ilaake main border line puri tarah spasht nahin he isliye koi spasht aadhaar nahin he seemaa kaa
 Bhutan connection of the dispute: In the area of donglong in Sikkim sector, where Indian troops protested against the construction of road from China, China says that this border is with Bhutan and India is the third party
 use isamen bolne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Whereas the truth is that India looks after Bhutan's foreign and defense matters and in such a situation, India has the right to resolve this issue with China
 china ko bhutan par bharat kaa ye prabhaav raas nahin aa rahaa
 What did the Chinese Foreign Ministry say? China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying - Hopefully countries respect the sovereignty of other countries
 china-bhutan seemaa nirupit nahin he, kisi tisare paksh ko is maamle main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie
 And irresponsible comment or action should not be taken
 china ne bharat par gupt agenda kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha- agar koi teesraa paksh, gupt agenda se, hastkshep karata he to yah bhutan kii samprabhutaa kaa apmaan he
 We do not want to see that because Bhutan deserves sovereignty by the international community
 china ne sikkim sector main sadak nirmaan ko vaid bataaya or jor diya ki yah chini kshetra main banaaya ja rahaa he jo na to bharat kaa or na hi bhutan kaa he
 He said that no other country has the right to interfere
 border par china ko raas nahin aa rahi bharat kii taiyaariyanmodi sarkaar ne pichley teen saal main china seemaa par sainya taiyaariyaan tej kii he
 PM Modi to build mountain strike corps of 1 lakh troops for China border, deal of 36 Rafale fighter jets from France, purchase of Guardian drones from US for Navy in the sea, construction of American fighter aircraft F-16 in India, Howitzer cannon Several steps have been taken, including the purchase of which has shocked China
 iske alaava china seemaa se lagate ilaakon buniyadi suvidhaon ke vikaas ke liye bhi kadam uthaae gaye hai
 Such as the landing of the Globemaster aircraft near the China border, the construction of a road bridge leading to the China border in Assam, the extension of the rail route to Leh, etc
, are steps that China sees as India's growing preparedness at the border
 america se dosti bhi china ko khatak rahipiem modi kii america yatra se bhi china kaaphi baukhalaayaa hua he
 China's response came after pictures of trump-modi's friendship that India was leaving its policy of non-alignment and standing against China with the US, could prove disastrous for India
 china kyon nahin ban saktaa bharat kaa swaabhaavik dost?kai maamalon par do padosi desh bharat or china aamane-saamne hai
 Recently, China also objected to the Dalai Lama's visit to Arunachal
 jabaki bharat ne us shuddh aadhyatmik yatra bataaya tha
 Earlier India had kept distance from china-pakistan CPEC project, even then China had targeted India
 enesji main bharat kii entry main bhi chi baadha banataa rahaa he

 Under this, the judicial process will be speeded up so that the people, especially the weaker section, get speedy justice

 Nur Jahan's house of leaders and media was also gathered in this non-amenities village of Shibli, which is 25 km from the city
 kaaphi khush dikhaai pad rahi noorjahan ko ummid he ki ab unhen apana kaam badhaane ke liye sarkari sahaayta mil sakegi
 Nur Jahan, who used to feed six members of his family by renting solar energy lanterns at a rent of 100 rupees per month to fifty people of the village, used to work in the fields till 15 years daily till three years ago
 shaam ko vah is paise kaa aataa or anya saamaan laakar apana or apane parivaar kaa pet paalati thi
 But a voluntary organization running a community radio in the village changed Nur Jahan's life three years ago and now he stands on his feet
 aarthik sahaayta milane kii aas bandhinoorjahan ko ummid he kipradhanmantri dwaara uskaa naam radio par lenese shaayad ab sarkaar se usko kuch aarthik sahaayta mil sake or vah apni 50 saura urja laalatenon ko badhaakar 100 kar len, kyonki gaanv main paryaapt bijli na hone ke kaaran bacchon ko padhaane ke liye uski saura laalaten kii maang ab din-ba-din badhati hi ja rahi he
 Very happy with the appreciation by the Prime Minister, Nur Jahan (age 55 years) said that my husband had died twenty years ago
 vah band master the
 The children were very young at the time of his death and did not even have farmland
 phir bacchon kaa pet paalane ke liye gaanv ke kheton main 15 rupee roj kii mazdooree karne lagi
 This helped her to feed her family
 noorjahan or uske parivaar kaa pet kabhi kabhi hi bhar paata tha, kyonki majudri roj nahin milti thi
 Financially strapped and poverty stricken, Nur Jahan was again forced to put a plate of solar energy at her home and a solar powered lantern, which she used to light her house, three years ago by a voluntary organization running a community radio in the village
 noorjahan ne bataaya ki jab use kabhi kabhi mazdooree nahin milti thi
 The villagers used to take lanterns from their children to teach them and in return they were given some money
 kiraye par dene lagi saura laalatenjab swayamsevi sanstha ko yah pataa chalaa ki vah is laalaten ko kiraye par chalaane lagi he, tab unhone use kuch laalaten or laakar di
 In this way, gradually he got 50 solar power lanterns and this NGO got five solar panels installed at his house
 ab gaanv ke log usase rojaanaa shaam ko saura laalaten le jate hai or subah use waapas de jate he
 She puts these lanterns back on the charge
 vah kahati he ki pareshaani tab hoti he, jab barish hoti he yaa phir badal hota he
 Then the lantern could not be charged and she could not give the lantern to anyone that day
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne jab man kii baat main noorjahan ke is saura laalaten kaa zikr kiya, to uske ghar netaaon kaa tantaa lag gaya
 Then he came to know that one of his lanterns made him famous all over the country
 noorjahan kahati he ki bahut khushi hui ki desh ke pradhanmantri ne meraa naam liya or mere kaam ko saraahaa
 But he is also sad that the state government or the district administration never helped him for this work nor gave any financial help

 In the Ishrat Jahan alleged fake encounter case, Union Minister of State for Home Kiran Rijiju has launched the biggest ever attack on the former UPA government
 rigiju ne kaha ki tatkaaleen grih mantralay ne sach chupaane ke liye pakistani aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e-taiyaba ke saath milakar kaam kiya
 In an exclusive conversation with India Today, Rijiju said, 'P
 chidambaram ke netritv main upie sarkaar ke grih mantralay ne lashkar ke saath kaam kiya auraatankwaad ke khilaafnram rukh apanaaya
 However, Rijiju continued, 'I personally drink
 chidambaram kaa bahut sammaan karata hum
 He is one of the best administrators ever, the best ministers ever
 'jaaniye, or kya kuch kaha kiran rigiju ne exclusive baatcheet main-1) maine pehle bhi kaha he ki ham yah nahin maanate kii ishrat jahaan ko clin chit dene kaa faisla chidambaram ke akele kaa he
 This is definitely a step taken by the top leadership of the Congress after taking care of everything
 2) agar aap maalegaanv dhamaake, samjhauta dhamaake or ishrat jahaan cese ko dekhen, to aap paaenge ki kaise chizon ko ekadam badal diya gaya
 3) i personally believe that Chidambaram is a good man and one of the best ministers, but the question arises how he was forced to give a clean chit to a staunch terrorist? 4) Lashkar in Ishrat Jahanamale Just after the encounter, he was called a 'martyr', but on the day a senior officer in the case was handed over the investigation, Lashkar changed his statement
 tab usne kaha ki usase galati hui he or ishrat uske modul kaa hissaa nahin thi
 5) It shows that they were working together
 yah bharat jaise mahaan desh main hone vaali sabase vinaashkari baat he
 See, the whole conversation- duniya ke sabase bade loktantr kii tasviir chand dinon main hi nahin badal jaati
 It takes long time, takes basic thinking and also needs passion to achieve its purpose
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii sarkaar ko bane 60 din hue hai, lekin 60 kii bisaat par modi ne apane das sapanom ko, das mishan ko anjaam tak pahunchane kaa ishaara kar diya he
 And it starts with a strict, confident and uninterested foreign policy
 kootneeti kii hatheliyon par bharat kii videsh niti likhane vaale nae niyantaa kaa naam he narendra modi
 64-year Prime Minister Narendra Modi has dreamed of a new world
 us duniya kaa, jise ab koi choudhary nahin chalaaegaa, balki saare panch milakar faisla lenge
 Hindustan has moved in this direction due to Modi's footsteps
 wo hindustan, jo na aankh jhukaakar jiega, na uthaakar dekhegaa, bas aankh milakar baat karegaa
 Modi had asked 60 million Indians for 60 months, but now it has been sixty days
 lekin wo kehete hai naa honhaar birwaan ke hot chikne paat
 Modi started the initiative of foreign relations from home
 ghar kaa darwaja pehali baar padosi ke liye kholaa or pados kaa dil jitate hue duniya main ek nai vyavastha ke liye chal pade
 Prime Minister Modi's first step out of Indian soil took place in Bhutan
 diplomasi kii ulatbaansi ko modi ne palat diya
 Where the Prime Minister's suitcase often used to rise for big countries, but Modi chose Bhutan and told that he is an expert in making many marks with one stone
 bhutan ke jariye modi ne saarc ko majboot karne kii koshish kii
 The new relationship with Bhutan could be an infallible weapon to stop Chinese activities in SAARC
 modi ne videsh niti ko kisi taqatvar desh kaa pichhalggu banane se peechha chhudaa liya
 Modi gave this message for the first time from Bhutan that he is aware of the Chinese move, but if you will take any route, then please be careful
 duniya ke rangamanch par modi ne apni bhoomika tay kar lee he
 India will no longer be a country of the East, which will continue to show its worthiness to join the West
 balki brazil main bricks sammelan ke dauraan apni bhav-bhangimaaon se bataa diya ki nai duniya ke madhya main hindustan khadaa hoga
 In Fortaleza, Brazil, Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping and heard the call for a new relationship with China
 hindi chini bhai-bhai kaa daur nae kalevar main lautne laga he
 If Modi connected with China, then through BRICS, he also drew a new world economy
 bricks ke pancho deshon- brazil, rus, bharat, china or dakshin africa ne milakar 100 arab dollar kii saajha puunji lagaai or ek bricks bank bana liya
 The BRICS Bank is being built in the Chinese city of Shanghai, which will have its first flagship Hindustani for a full 6 years
 abhi do maheene beete hai lekin modi ne vasudaiv kutunbakam ke naare ke saath apni videsh niti kii jhalak dikhaa di he
 The Prime Minister showed a glimpse of his foreign policy within 60 days, but the real foreign policy has to be tried on neighboring Pakistan
 desh kii bagdor sambhalate hi modi ne paak kii taraf dosti kaa haath badha diya
 But Pakistan is not deterring its antics on the Line of Control, like a Statesman, Modi showed restraint and now the Foreign Secretary level talks between the two countries are about to begin
 apane shapath grahan samaaroh main saarc ke bahaane pakistan ke pradhanmantri navaj sharif ko bulaakar modi ne saaf-saaf sanket de diya tha ki bharat-pakistan ab rishte kii nai trek par saath-saath daudenge
 Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari had said that we can change friends but not neighbors
 jis padosi ke saath rishton main aksar tikhe tevar bane rahete hai, use dosti kii patari par laane kii koshish narendra modi ne kii
 The scope of diplomacy increased so much that even personal relationships were formed
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif kii maa ke liye tohfe main shawl bheja to jawaab main modi kii maa ke liye sari ai
 However, so far Pakistan has not joined hands with the warm hand of friendship, which was expected
 niyantran rekha par pakistan kii taraf se ghuspaith jari he or bhartiya javaanon kii hatya kaa silsilaa bhi
 But in order to improve relations with Pakistan, the Modi government made it clear by raising the question of Kashmiri Pandits that Jammu and Kashmir will always be there for the residents
 is bich paak adhikrut kashmir kaa naam pioke kii jagah piojeke karne kaa bhi prastaav aa gaya, kyonki pakistan ne to kashmir hi nahin, jammu ke bhi ek hisse par kabja kar rakhaa he
 The question beyond the glimpse given in two months is whether Pakistan will take any action against 26 / 11 perpetrator Hafiz Saeed
 kya pakistan seemaa paar se aatankwaad par roak lagayegaa
 And will it stop the activities Pakistan is doing with China in occupied Kashmir? in sabake bich bharat pakistan ke bich sachiv str kii baatcheet 25 agast se islamabad main shuru hogi
 It has been sixty days now
 saath maheene main 58 maheene baaki hai
 They will decide 58 months in which direction relations with Pakistan go
 museebataan desh main bhi kam nahinpradhanmantri narendra modi ko raaj-paat sanbhale do maheene ho gaye hai
 Modi's effort is to build a strong infrastructure from day one
 sadak mantralay se lekar shahari vikaas mantralay is mishan main lag chuke hai
 Pakistan is a problem on the foreign front, so inflation on the domestic front
 mahangaai kii lapaton main jhulaste desh ne modi main apane liye ek maseehaa dekha tha
 Inflation has not come down in 60 days, but Modi government has already moved four steps ahead to find a complete cure
 26 ko shapath lee, 27 ko south block sthit apane daftar jaakar kaam-kaaj sambhala or 28 ko modi cabinet kaa pehla faisla aayaa, maano achche dinon kii pehali kist ai ho
 SIT on Black Money On 28 May 2014, the Modi cabinet formed the SIT to bring back black money stashed abroad
 ek america company ke mutabik, videshon main bharat kaa 29 lakh 70 hajaar karod rupee kaala dhan jamaa he
 Therefore, after Modi became the PM, his cabinet took the first decision to form an SIT, in which the first success was that some money was discovered in the Swiss bank
 lekin do maheene baad thanda padataa maamla dekh bijepi ke hi netaaon ko lagane laga he ki pataa nahin kaala dhan aayega bhi yaa nahin
 The Finance Minister is comforting in some way
 mahangaai se paar paane ke majboot upyek taraf kaale dhan kaa masalaa he to duusari taraf us mahangaai kaa, jisase puraa desh karaah rahaa he
 On 2 March 2011, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appointed then-chief Minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi as the chairman of the Working Group on Consumer Affairs
 manmohan ne modi se mahangaai rokane kaa suzav maanga tha
 Modi submitted a report containing 64 measures, but that report went in cold storage
 modi ne us report par kaam shuru kar diya he
 a price stabilization fund should be created to control the prices of essential food items, so that the state governments can be helped
 dilachasp ye ki is baat kaa zikr bijepi ne ghoshnaptr main bhi kiya tha
 There is talk of dividing the FCI into three parts, so that the functioning can be expedited and the responsibility fixed properly
 kalabazari or jamkhori ko gairajamaanti aparaadh kii shrenee main rakhaa jaae or iske liye sajaa bhi badhaai jaae
 The agricultural market should be strengthened by promoting cooperatives, so that farmers get good prices and get rid of middlemen
 <mahangaai rokane ke liye pradhanmantri ne kai baar krishi mantri radhamohan singh or khaadya-aapurti mantri ramvilas paswan ke saath baithak kii
 The ministers even gave presentations
 modi bhi jaanate hai ki hakim lukaman ke paas bhi mahangaai ko chhomantar karne kii dawa nahin hogi
 It will also take time and some tough steps will also have to be taken
 60 din main modi ne ye jarur dikhaane kii koshish kii he ki wo mahangaai kaa rambaan ilaaj dhundhane main lage hai
 But his efforts look long to reach success
 bijli ne diya modi sarkaar ko jhatakamhangaai ke baad modi sarkaar ke saamne ek badi chunauti bijli sankat he
 The Modi government claims that it will provide electricity round the clock in the entire country and for this, it is working on the Gujarat model itself
 kahaan to ujaale kaa vaada tha or kahaan desh kii rajdhani hi andhere main dub gai
 Soon after the coronation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government with a blazing majority received an electric shock
 jaise-taise sarkaar isse nikali, lekin is damakham ke saath ki puure desh ko choubiso ghante bijli denge
 Sometimes crying of coal and sometimes some other problem
 desh ke kai hisson main ab bhi bijli sapane main hi aati he
 Modi wants that dream to come true, exactly on the Gujarat model
 bijli or vikaas ke model seekhney ke liye dilli se hukmran us gujarat main gaye, jahaan modi ne 13 saal tak raaj kiya
 Jyotigram Yojana started in 2003
 ise pehle 8 jilon main shuru kiya gaya
 By November 2004, it was implemented throughout the state
 gujarat sarkaar kaa daawa he ki 2006 tak gujarat ke 90 fisadi hisse main 24 ghante bijli rahane lagi
 About 18 thousand villages had left the lantern era
 kheti ke liye supplai dene vaale feader ko rihaishi or vyavsaayik upbhog kii bijli se alag kar diya gaya
 The country is not just all over Gujarat, there are many problems here, without which it will not be easy to provide electricity to the whole of India
 modi sarkaar ke to 60 din gujarey hai, bijli kii chamak deshbhar main paidaa karne ke liye abhi or vakt lagegaa
 The government has also claimed to take several measures to increase power generation
 lekin aam logon kii samaj main aane vaale rodmap or har raat ke andhere ko harne vaali bijli kaa intjaar abhi baaki he
 The dream of nirmal-aviral Ganga is dying due to pollution
 maa ganga ko bachaana pradhanmantri narendra modi kii praathamikta main itnaa upar he ki iske liye baqayada ek mantralay bhi bana diya
 In the first general budget for the Ganges, a long broad plan has also been made
 bas intjaar us yojana ko uske khubasurat anjaam tak pahunchane kaa he
 The waves of the Ganges on which life used to eat, it is being said in its own pain today
 har lahar ke saath ganga kaa dard umadta he
 After descending from Gangotri, the poison of pollution begins to dissolve in its pure water
 us ganga ko ek bhageerath kii jarurat thi, modi sarkaar us kaam main juty he
 After a week of taking charge of the country, Modi prepared the road map of Ganga Kalyan
 ganga kii swatchta se lekar uske kinare kii saaf-safai tak ke liye rope map taiyaar he
 Modi added five ministers to the Blue Print Action Committee
 uma bharti: nadi vikaas or jal sansaadhan mantrinitin gadakari: shipping or parivahan mantriprakash javdekar: soochna env prasaaran rajya mantripiyush goyal: koyala env urja mantrishripad nike: paryaton mantrior jab pehla bajet aayaa to usamen ganga ke uddhaar ke liye 6300 karod rupee kaa namaami gange plan rakhaa gaya
 There is a plan of around Rs 2037 crore to repair the Ganga, while Rs 4200 crore to run the ship and connect it to tourism in the Ganges
 vahiin ghaaton kii marammat or sajaav-shringaar ke liye 100 karod rupee kaa bajet rakhaa gaya he
 In sixty days the Modi government has stirred the Ganges water
 lekin lokkathaon ke mutabik shiv kii jataaon se nikalakar dharti par jaisi ganga utari thim, waisi ganga ko paane ke liye bhageerath prayaas to karnaa hi padegaa
 Promote pilgrimage and tourism is right that the flight of Narendra Modi's dream goes beyond the moon and stars
 wo chaahate hai ki vigyaan or takanic main bhi hindustan sirmaur bane
 But in view of the religious belief of Hindustan, they are also connecting the pilgrimage sites by road and rail
 koshish shuru ho chuki he, bas kamyaabi kaa intjaar he
 Every Hindu in the country desires to visit Char Dham at least once in his lifetime
 agar yah tirthayatra aaraam se ho jaae to sone par suhaaga
 The Modi government has taken the initiative to fulfill this desire
 modi raaj main isaki shuruyaat vaishno devi ke darbar tak train pahunchane se hui
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the train going from Delhi to Katra, making it easy for the mother to reach the mother's rate
 trikuta pahadiyon par bane stesan kaa naam shri mata vaishno devi katra stesan rakhaa gaya he
 Three platforms have been built at the station
 katra pahunchane vaali train 10 choti surangon or 50 se bhi zyada chote-bade pulon se hokar guzarati he
 But this is only the beginning
 modi ne desh ke zyaadaatar tirth sthanon ko rail se jodne kii yojana banaayi he
 a tourist train from Sethubandh Rameswaram is intended to take many other pilgrimage sites via Bangalore, Chennai, Ayodhya, Varanasi and Haridwar
 vahi swami vivekanand ke naam se ek train chalaane kaa bhi elaan hua, jo us mahaan sant ke naitik vichaaron ko jan-jan tak pahunchaayegi
 To develop the pilgrimage as a tourist place, a plan of 100 crores was made in the railway budget
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane chunavi bhaashanon main bhi baar-baar tirth ko tourism se jodne kii baat kii thi
 Now, if he comes to power, in his initial sixty days Modi wants facilities like VIP lounge, guide counter, escalator, lift, parking at the pilgrimage stations
 philhal to 100 karod se sava sau karod hindustaniyon kaa dil jeetne kii koshish shuru hui he
 The dream of bullet train will now be a big dream of our Prime Minister to run bullet train in India also
 modi sarkaar ke pehle rail bajet main iskaa elaan bhi ho gaya
 But before the bullet is run, Modi has to rectify the current railway situation, in which neither a train derails nor an unmanned crossing
 goli kii tarah chhootane vaali is bullate train kaa sapana to pradhanmantri narendra modi kii ankhon main naa jane kab se basaa he
 After becoming Prime Minister, Modi took the first step towards making the bullet train come true when Railway Minister Sadanand Gowda made a special discussion in his budget
 duusari rail gadiyon kii chhodie, jis rajdhani or shatabdi ko hindustani railway kii shaan or jaan mana jaataa he, wo bhi 150 kilometre kii raftaar se daud lagane ke baad haaf jaati hai
 While the bullet train runs, it is not ready to run less than 250 km
 jis bullate train ko china se lekar japan tak ne apane yahaan rosemara kaa saadhan bana rakhaa he, use modi hindustan kaa bhi sach banane main jute hai
 Between Delhi and Agra, the trial of the country's fastest high-speed semi-high speed train, which has a maximum speed of 160 kilometers per hour
 lekin bullate train tak pahunchane ke liye saath din nahin, saath maheene kaa samay bhi kam pad saktaa he
 According to an estimate, a bullet train will require at least 60 thousand crores to run
 jahaan saadhaaran trainon ke liye patariyaan durust nahin hai, vahaan bullate train ke liye paise kahaan se aaenge
 The infrastructure of railway infrastructure is that India has a network of 64 thousand kilometers, but out of that only 15-20 percent of the track can withstand a speed of 170 kilometers
 saaf he ki 300 kilometre tak kii raftaar chune ke liye bhi hamaara buniyadi dhaancha taiyaar nahin he
 Efforts are being made to make the railways in India in the true sense of the rail which was abandoned in India for many years as a means of transport and freight
 modi ko yakeen he ki ek din hindustani patari bhi itani majboot hogi ki us par bullate train daudegi
 Modi set up a school of mps after 30 years, a party has got majority
 pradhanmantri ko pataa he ki prachand bahumat kaa nasha party ko asal muddon se hi direl kar saktaa he
 That is why they have maintained a code of conduct for their mps, ministers and leaders
 or haa, uske paalan main koi kotahi bardaasht nahin
 The newly elected mps of BJP were in the role of students and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was like Head Master Saab
 vaise to modi bhi pehali baar hi saansad bane hai, lekin sansadeey vyavastha main kaam karne kaa unhen lanbaa tajurba he
 Sharing that experience among his mps, Modi made it clear that the mps should come to Parliament with full preparation
 badi ummiido ke saath sava sau karod hindustaniyon ne narendra modi ko desh kii bagdor saunpi he
 Modi also knows that small mistakes can feast on big problems
 isiilie sarkaar banane ke turant baad modi kii taraf se saansadon ko farmaan aayaa ki wo pravaktaa kii tarah bartaav naa karen
 They come to Parliament with full preparation
 apane kisi sage-sambandhi ko apana pratinidhi nahin banaaen or bhai-bhatijawad se bachein
 But when Priyanka Singh Rawat, the MP of Modi's party, made her father a public representative, Modi explained to him that what he is saying is not just for saying
 nateeja ye hua ki 24 ghante ke bheetar priyanka ko apana faisla badalanaa padaa
 According to sources, in order to maintain the image of the ministers and to keep away from corruption, Modi did not allow the ministers who were pas of ministers during the Manmohan government to connect with their ministers
 ishaara saaf tha ki saaf chhavi par ratti bhar daag bhi bardaasht nahin
 Barring others, Rajnath Singh, the country's home minister and Modi's No
 2, did not get this opportunity
 modi ne sabko samajha diya ki yogyata hi paimaana hoga
 Modi has also directed to speed up the disposal of criminal cases against tainted leaders
 iske liye unhone kanoon mantri ravishankar prasad ko fast trek banaakar ek saal ke andar maamalon ko nipataane ke liye rodmap banane ko kaha he
 According to sources, the Prime Minister has also directed Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Ravi Shankar Prasad to prepare its blue print
 technology main bhi desh peeche na rah jaepradhanmantri narendra modi kii pahchaan ek aise rajaneta kii he, jinaki takanic main bhi kaaphi dilchaspee hoti he
 Modi gave a glimpse of this in just two months, from satellite flight to INS Vikramaditya
 ek taraf kisaanon kii baat to duusari taraf javaanon kaa hausala
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the country that warship, which the country had been waiting for for a long time
 ienes vikramaditya
 Modi knows that in a country which does not have scientific progress, that country cannot write a new saga of upliftment even if it wants to
 isiilie jab wo antariksh main bharat kii kamyaabi kii gauravamayi udaan ko dekh rahe the to unhen is baat kaa santosh bhi tha or khushi bhi ki bharat bhi duniya ko bahut kuch de saktaa he
 The question is also how long Hindustan will remain a slave of foreign technology
 do maheene ke andar hi modi ne is dharna ko todane kii koshish kii he
 That is why the budget announced the opening of new iits, AIIMS and iims
 modi ne jhalak to dikhalaa di he
 But for the whole picture, he has been talking for 60 months, but not for 60 months
 ummid he ki paanch saal ke andar wo sapane sach honge, jinhen philhal khuli ankhon se desh dekh rahaa he
 Prime Minister Modi had asked for 60 months, yet 60 days have passed
 put ke paanv to paalane main dikhne lage he, aage-aage dekhie hota he kya
 In August 2011, when Anna Hazare announced that the agitation for the Jan Lokpal Bill could last 10 years or 20 years, he had no idea that he would be the home of those who made him realize the reality
 4 janvari 2012: tasveeron main dekhen india todemumbai ke mrdie maidan par apane anshan ke pehle din bheed ke abhaav ne unhen prastaavit jail baro andolan ko sthagit karne or dirghakaalik yojana par puraa dhyaan dene kaa ek sateek bahaanaa de diya
 28 December 2011: See in pictures India Today, Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan can claim the credit for stopping Team Anna on the way
 dilli main hue pichley do upwaason ke dauraan anaadipan dikhaane vaale party alaakaman ko unhone dikhaa diya he ki kisi virodh ko kaise dabaaya jaataa he
 He created an atmosphere of awe by getting the additional chief secretary (home) Umesh Chandra Sarangi to announce that any provocative speech would be arrested
 unhone mrdie maidan ke dainik kiraaye 2
 5 lakhs
 main bhi koi riyaayat dene se inkaar kar diya
 21 December 2011: See in pictures India Today Anna also made mistakes in the strategy
 sabase pehle to, mumbai sthit gaiyr sarkari sanghathan-jaagruk naagarik manch ne mrdie maidan par jor diya, jahaan teji se pahunchane waalon ke liye bhi nikatatam railway stesan se bas se pahunchane main 20 minute lagate hai
 a source close to Hazare said that he had made up his mind to go on a hunger strike at Azad Maidan, which seems to be more in-between, but Team Anna forced him to change his mind due to more crowds and media greed
 14 disambar 2011: tasveeron main dekhen india tudentija yah hua ki nimna madhyam varg se aane vaale zyaadaatar hajaare samarthak andolan main hissaa nahin le sake
 Rajesh Kamble, a rickshaw puller, says, "I can feed my family of six people only when i get Rs 500 a day
" kamaun
 If i sit there for four hours, i cannot earn
 ''soshal media kaa istemaal karne waalon ne bhi, yah kah kar yuvaaon ke man main dar paidaa kiya ki agar ve jail baro andolan main hissaa lenge, to unhen samasya ho sakati he
 Blogger Harini Kalamur was the most outspoken, "a small warning to all young people who want to break the law in their idealism and go to jail - if you went to jail, it could result in your criminal record
" yah record hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye barkaraar rahata he
 However, the volunteers of India Against Corruption claimed that more than one lakh people had registered their names for the Jail Bharo agitation 
 lekin is baar kaath kii handi nahin chadh pai or anna ko aatm chintan ke liye ralegan siddhi lautnaa padaa
 In the year 2012, buying the iphone became one of the motives of my life as soon as the smartphone market got ready
 sirf isliye nahin ki bheed main alag dikhnaa he
 But also because the technology which has worked to shut the world in fist, what makes the technology's head and the most established company at the end, which is worth gold and silver
 jeb or halaat ko tatolane ke baad 2014 main pehla smartphone iphone 6 Plus kharida or ab iphone 7 Plus kharidne kii taiyaari he
 The speculation continues about the features of Apple's iphone-7, iphone-7 Plus and iphone-7 Pro
 yah bhi sahi he ki maujuuda iphone 6s or 6s plus kai mandandon par samsung or duusari badi companiyon ke product se pichhadta jaan padataa he
 There are many smartphones in the market which have better features than iphone! But being an iphone user and looking at the cost of the phone, i would still like to buy the iphone itself
 haalanki, 6 plus ke baad beete saal 6es plus kharidne kii himmat na to main juta paaya or na hi meri iemai ko dekhte hue meri jeb ne hi yah suzav diya
 Because it is a little difficult for an average payer to buy a new iphone every year
 lekincifhone 6 Plus ke baad yphone ke 7thjanaresana kaa intjaar lambey samay se rahaa he
 Probably also because there was nothing new in iphone 6s / 6s plus
 
 
 
 So i will buy iphone 7 Plus: 1) The first drawback to the iphone 6 Plus is that it does not have the 3D Touch feature like the iphone 6s Plus
 6es plus main zyada kuch nayaa nahin hone ke kaaran us par phir se paise kharch karnaa sahi nahin jaan padataa
 But the iphone 7 Plus / Pro has many new features, which, like its combo pack, is a perfect deal for an iphone lover
 2) yphone 7 siries kii dizin main kai badlaav kiye gaye hai,jinamein headphone jaik kaa nahin hona orphone kaa pehle se adhik slim hona shaamil he
 In such a situation, i will now have an answer for the bully of Gionee and other slime phones
 3) chhanakar aa rahi jaankaree ke mutabik, yphone 7 siries main camere kii kshamta ko behatar kiya gaya he
 Especially the feature with dual cameras is going to enhance the photography experience
 vaise bhi yphone ke camere ko samsung ke note 7 or es 7 se khaasi takkar mili he
 That is, the ball is now in Apple's court
 4) soni experia or samsung jaise brands pehle hi bazaar main water pruf smartphone utaar chuke hai
 In such a situation, this deficiency is missed in the 6 series as an iphone user
 lekin yphone 7 siries water pruf hoga
 That is, it is like a boon for those who use the phone from Befikri like me
 5) appal yphone kii sound quality behtareen he
 While the stereo speakers and wireless headphones in the iphone 7 series are going to make this experience even more spectacular
 6) appal kaa daawa ki 7 siries gaming ke anubhav ko aurbehtareen banaaegi
 This simply means that the display quality of the phone will be much better than before
 vaise bhi rejolution ke maamle main samsung es7 ne appal 6es plus ko kadi takkar di he
 7) As an iphone user company, one of my great expectations is about display glass
 aam taur par duusare smartphone kii dispale glass gorilla glass- 3 yaa 4 he, jo kaaphi taff he
 But Apple iphone lags behind in this case
 company ko dispale glass ko taff bananaa hoga taaki yah halke jhatkon ko bardaasht kar sake
 By the way, for the information, let us know that the price of Apple 6 Plus display glass is close to 20 thousand
 8) yphone 6 plus main 1GB DDR3 ram aurabia8 procesar he
 However, there has never been a complaint about the phone hanging

 That is, the processing of the phone will be more smooth than before

 However, with 2915 mah battery, the 6 Plus never cheated
 lekin ummid he ki appal ise badhaakar safar or lagaataar jarney ke dauraan mujhe is chakkar se bhi chhutkaaraa dilaaegaa
 Apart from this, the three magnetic dots behind the 7 Plus / Pro point to new possibilities, which i am very keen as a tech lover to test
 10) aakhri lekin sabase mahatvapurn
 My simple understanding says that if i am spending 60 to 70 thousand rupees on my smartphone, then i should buy a product that the world does not have to tell that it is of this extraordinary price
 jaahir taur par raah chalate ek yujar kaa yah rutaba yphone hi de saktaa he

 The Mumbai Special Court, which is investigating the extradition attempt and Mallya's pretext for laundering case, approved the Enforcement Directorate's request only in February 2017

 Former BJP president Nitin Gadkari met MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Monday
 is mulaakaat ko lekar ab siyasat garm hoti najar aa rahi he
 If sources are to be believed, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray is angered by this meeting
 uddhav ne is mulaakaat ke baad maharashtra bijepi ke adhyaksh devendra fadanvis ko matoshri main bulaayaa
 Uddhav has sought clarification from the BJP on the matter
 aisi atakalein lagaai ja rahi hai ki raaj thakare endie main shaamil ho sakate hai
 However, Gadkari himself has denied this news
 gadakari ne raaj thakare se gupachup mulaakaat kii to siyaasi charchaa kaa daur shuru hona to laazmi he
 Speculation started that efforts were on to bring Raj into the NDA
 lekin, gadakari ne khud milane kii vajah kaa khulaasa kar diya
 Nitin Gadkari said after this meeting, 'I met Raj Thackeray
 main netaaon se miltaa rahata hum
 We do not want to divide votes
 gathbandhan kaa koi scope nahin he lekin ham ye tay karnaa chaahate hai ki raaj thakare voton kaa bantwaaraa na karen
 No one should feel bad about this meeting
 'bataaya jaataa he ki gadakari kaa ye kadam uddhav thakare ko raas nahin aayaa
 As soon as he came to know about this meeting, he spoke to BJP President Rajnath Singh
 isse pehle bhi gadakari ne jab raaj thakare kii tarif kii thi tab bhi uddhav ne is par aitraaj jataayaa tha
 Significantly, the BJP has made a lot of efforts to bring MNS into the NDA, but these efforts could not succeed due to the mutual fight of Thackeray brothers

 Two days ago when the first list of candidates for BJP and Shiv Sena were released, it became clear that the hopes of bringing MNS to the NDA were over
 baharhaal, gadakari kii taaja koshishon kaa raaj par kitna asar hua, iskaa khulaasa abhi nahin ho paaya he
 Raj Thackeray has not agreed yet, it is expected that on March 9, he will speak about it

 a large ship of water was hired in the heart of the sea in the dream city of Mumbai
 raat thi jashn kii, casinon main jue kii or zahaaj ke deck par hasinaaon ke cabre kii
 In the midst of this celebration in Samundar, the owner of a company was dreaming of doubling, triple and four times the money from his thousands of investors
 samandar me aaleeshaan cruge kaa safar jari thi or jari tha company ke maalik ke haroonges elaan
 There were claims to be made from millionaire to millionaire overnight
 naach-cabre or casinon kaa safar raat ko paravaan chadh rahaa tha
 Fifty nautical miles away from Mumbai, the ship did not sink in the waves of the sea, but the company sank and sank along with the hard earned money of more than four lakh gullible investors
 samandar ke bich krooj par sapanom kaa saudagar hai ravinder deshmukh
 Deshmukh who dipped two thousand crores of earnings of more than four lakh innocent people
 wo deshmukh, jisko desh main kai rajyon kii police saal bhar se dhund rahi he, lekin wo ek haseen khwab kii tarah kahin gaayab ho gaya he
 Deshmukh, who weaved a web of loot worth billions of rupees by showing faces of big leaders and film stars of the country, which till date the police could not distinguish
 lut kii is amar katha kaa ek-ek adhyay har kisi kii ankhen khol degaa
 He came out of the sea of mumbai with a ship of dreams and he was accompanied by hundreds of travelers with new dreams, who were actually playing on him at the stake of millions
 lekin karodpati banane kaa safar achaanak bich raste main hi khatm ho gaya
 Actually, he had gone out to sell ocean waves, not a chit fund scheme
 or hua bhi aakhir vahi
 
 
 The ship survived in this golden voyage to the sea, but the dreams of millions and millions sank
