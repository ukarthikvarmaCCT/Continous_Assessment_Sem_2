 Water warrior 'gathbandhan jari rahegaa lekin aage ke upachunaavon main bispi kaaryakarta sakriy taur par madadgaar nahin rahenge', bispi ke is bayaan ne samaajawaadee party ke maathe par bal laa diya he to bijepi ko gathbandhan khatai me padane kii dhundhlee sambhaavna dikhne lagi he or party philhal ise gathbandhan ke pench ke taur par dekh rahi he
 In the midst of an alliance with the Samajwadi Party, Mayawati gently slammed the alliance and expressed that the alliance would be on her terms, with Mayawati clearly saying that her cadre would not help anyone in a by-election and save her strength for the 2019 elections
 haalanki akhilesh ke liye raahat kii baat ye he ki mayawati ne mangalvaar kii party kii baithak main saaf-saaf elaan kiya ki 2019 main wo bade gathbandhan ke liye taiyaar hai or sapa ke saath gathbandhan rahegaa
 Despite this, a press release has given sleep to everyone and everyone is extracting their meaning in their own way
 mayawati ne likhaa ki upachunaavon main basapa ke cader gorakhpur or phulpur kii tarah active hokar kaam nahin karenge
 On this statement of Mayawati, Samajwadi Party spokesperson Sunil Sajan has said that there is no such thing as a rift in the alliance because our alliance is for big goals and big elections and everyone's focus is on 2019, so BJP should be concerned about the by-elections There should not be any misunderstanding
 udhar bijepi ko gathbandhan nahin hone kii dhundhlee si aas najar aane lagi he, jisapar mohsin raja ne kaha ki is gathbandhan main bahut pench hai or aage dekhie is gathbandhan main or kya-kya hota he
 So at the same time, the Congress says that this alliance has shown its trailer and will now show the entire film in 2019
 mayawati ne apane cader or vidhayakon ke saath baithak main bade gathbandhan kii baat to kii lekin ab sabhi gathbandhan 2019 ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kii jane kii baat kahi, mayawati ne 24 march ko apni press conference main ek taraf gathbandhan kii himaayat kii to duusari ore apni ek press relies main is baat ko saaf kar diya ki aane vaale upachunaav main BSP ke cader kisi party kaa samarthan nahin karenge
 That is, in the Kairana and Nurpur by-elections, there will no longer be any solidarity like Samajwadi Party and Phulpur and Gorakhpur in the BSP because Mayawati clearly said that her workers will not work so actively in the by-elections
 darasal kairana seat par areldi kii najar he or areldi ke ek vidhayak ne cross voting kar BJP ko samarthan diya tha isse naaraaz mayawati ne areldi ko chetavanee bhi di thi, mana ja rahaa he mayawati apana stand or kadaa kar sakati hai
 Mayawati wants to remain until 2019, super-boss analysts believe that Mayawati managed to transfer her vote in Phulpur and Gorakhpur, but in Kairana, if this coalition gets a challenge from BJP, then the atmosphere of the alliance may be light
 philhal sapa bhale hi jeet gai ho lekin charchaa mayawati or unke votbank kii hi he, aise main mayawati is maahaul ko 2019 tak banaae rakhana chaahati hai taaki gathbandhan kii super bos vahi bani rahen
 After the press conference on the very next day of the Rajya Sabha election, BSP supremo Mayawati released the press release and in this press release clearly stated that her workers will play active participation on the lines of Phulpur Allahabad in the upcoming by-elections and put all their energy into 2019
 Will save for mayawati is bayaan main ek taraf 2019 ke gathbandhan kii sambhaavnaaon par prashnchinh khadaa kiya to duusari tarasmayawati ne apane sahyogiyonko chetavanee bhi de daali
 In this same press conference, Mayawati made the issue of cross-voting of RLD the same and issued a warning for Ajit Singh
 areldi par apana gussa jaahir karne ke baad bataaya ja rahaa he ki ajit singh ne mayawati se baat kii or ek baar phir gathbandhan ke prati apni aasthaa jataai, isi tarah rajyasabha chunaav main haar ke baad akhilesh yadav ne bhi mayawati se phone par baat kii he or duusare str ke netaaon ke bich talmail ko lekar baaten aage bad rahi hai
 In such a situation, Mayawati will not want to lose by losing in the second by-election

 Ram Gopal is a member of Mulayam Singh's family so he does not want to say anything on his comment
 singh ne kaha ki yadi ram gopal yadav unase itane naaraaz hai to mulaayam singh or unke parivaar ko saifai mahotsav main unako aamantrit karne ke bare main pun:vichaar karnaa chahie
 Amar Singh, who resigned from all party posts last week, has been invited by Mulayam to attend the ongoing Saifai Festival in a small town near Etawah in Uttar Pradesh next week
 singh ne apane blog main likhaa he ki vah apni party yaa party ke pratham parivaar (mulaayam singh ke parivaar) ke haathon yisu messiah kii tarah cross par nahin chadhaaya janaa chaahate, na hi sucraat kii tarah jehar pinaa chaahate hai or na hi mahatma gandhi kii tarah goli kaa shikaar hona chaahate hai
 Instead, they have high hopes from their leader and elder brother Mulayam Singh
 amar singh ne apni aalochana ke sambandh main kaha ki vah unako bataayenge ki vah sapa main puri tarah se sahaj hai
 He gets respect and love from the party chief
 unhone kaha ‘‘ ishwar na kare lekin , yadi mujhe party se baahar hone ke liye majaboor kiya gaya to mere paas vikalpon kii koi kami nahin he

 Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly has advised Virat Kohli, the captain of Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and currently one of the most successful batsmen in the country, that he should focus on batting more than captaincy
 kohli kii captaini main aaarasibi ne 10 main se 6 match ganvaae hai
 Ganguly, who was one of the best captains of Team India, feels that Virat is taking a lot of pressure on himself
 ganguli ne kaha, 'shaayad ab samay aa gaya he ki kohli ko baithkar apni captaini ke bare main sochna chahie
 i spoke to Gautam Gambhir 7-8 days ago and asked him to take the captaincy differently and i think Virat should also look at his captaincy differently
 'ganguli ke mutabik captaini kii mushkilon se kabhi na kabhi har khilaadi ke sabakontious mind par asar padataa he
 He said, 'we all fall in the captaincy, in which the team needs to be steered in the right direction, keep this thing right and keep that thing right
 
 
 
 Et cetera et cetera

 film kaa naam : vishwaroop 2diarector: camel hasanstar cast: camel hasan, jayadeep ahlavat, rahul bose ,puja kumaar, shekhar kapur ,wahidaa rahamaan,andria jeremiynvadhi: 2 ghanta 24 minutesrtificate: u / aretimga: 2
 When Kamal Haasan's film Vishwaroopam was released in 5 starsaal 2013, there was an atmosphere of contravention everywhere
 kahin iske naam ke upar vivaad hone lage to kahin dharmik baton ke chalate is par bain lagane kii bhi koshish kii gai
 The film was banned in Tamil Nadu, while it received a clean chit from CBFC
 ab paanch saal baad is film kaa doosraa part relies hua he
 This time there is no shadow of the previous film on it
 aakhirkaar kisi bani he film, padhie samiksha-kahani:film kii kahani ro agent major visham ahamed kashmiri (camel hasan) kii he jinaki patni nirupama (puja kapur ) hai
 This story begins from the time Visham leaves Vishwaroopam 1 from Al Qaeda's mission
 visham ko is baar bhi mishan ke tahat umr kuraishi (rahul bose) ke dwaara failaae gaye aatankwaad ko khatm karnaa he
 In the mission, he encounters different types of people and events, which Vishaam also has to face a lot of hardships, meanwhile, the story has Salim (jaideep Ahlawat) as Vishaam's mother (waheeda Rehman), Colonel Jagannath
 (shekhar Kapur) and other characters also have an entry
 bahut saare utaar-chadhaav bhi dikhaai dete
 Now can Umar stop the spread of terrorism of Qureshi or what happens eventually or you have to watch the film to go? Kamal Haasan will no longer act, will give attention to politics
 Watch the film: The story of the film Kamal Haasan Style Has film main hai octen ection darshane kii koshish kii gai he jo ki aakarshan kaa centre he
 Kamal Haasan has acted quite well and even at this age his penchant for work is seen on screen
 film kaa diarection acha he or cinemetography ke saath-saath lokation bhi kamaal kii hai
 The background score and title song is good
 film ke baaki kirdaar jaise andria jeremiyaan ,jayadeep ahlavat, anant mahadevan, shekhar kapur, rahul bose kaa kaam sahaj he
 Waheeda Rehman ji has a small visible role
 camel hasan ke dwaara bole gaye kuch samvaad bhi kaaphi majboot he
 Weak Links: The weak link of the film has flashbacks from time to time which may confuse you
 haalanki film kii shuruyaat main vishvarupam 1 ke bare main kuch baaten bataai gai hai, lekin film dekhne ke dauraan aapako iske pehle bhaag se puri tarah se parichit hona chahie
 The film also reminds you of typical South India films
 camel hasan ke alaava film ke baaki kirdaaron ko or bhi zyada sajaayaa or sanvaara ja saktaa tha
 In front of Kamal Haasan, the film's villain seems very weak, if he were strong then interest would have been even better
 film ke screenple ko bhi durust kiya jaataa to or bhi majaa aata
 Mulk Movie Review: Rishi's great role, to be remembered for acting filmbox Office: The budget of the film is being said to be around 55 crores and the country, Mission Impossible is already engaged in the theater, due to which the earnings will be affected

 jaise-jaise syria or iraq menaiieski jameen khisakati ja rahi he uskaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi or zyada beraham hota ja rahaa he
 So far, Baghdadi militants who have released photographs of people strangling, shooting, burnt alive or bombed in installments have released photographs of 175 people being put to death together for the first time
 ye pehali baar he jab aies ne itani badi taadaad main ek saath logon kaa katleam kiya he
 According to the Syrian army, ISIS last week attacked a cement factory in Dumer, a northeastern region of Damascus
 hamale ke dauraan vahaan kaam karne vaale kareeb 300 mazdooron ko agava karkeatankwadiapane saath le gaye the
 The factory from which the workers were abducted is named al-badiye Cement Company
 damishq ke paas anjaam di ghatnasthaneey logon kii maane to unhone agava kiye gaye mazdooron ko ISIS kii gadiyon main le jate hue dekha tha
 According to local residents, they were being taken towards Tal Dakweh area
 khabar he ki unhen aisi jagah le jaaya gaya jo iesas ke kabje vaale hai
 According to the Syrian army, 175 out of 300 kidnapped by ISIS militants later killed simultaneously
 is katleam ko damishq ke aasapaas hi anjaam diya gaya
 The human rights organization also gave the intervention that about 140 workers had escaped from the clutches of ISIS
 haalanki, wo kahaan hai or kis haal main hai, iske bare main koi jaankaree hasil nahin hui he
 However, ISIS claims that 170 workers have been released
 lekin wo kahaan hai, ye kisi ko nahin maaloom
 Therefore, questions are being raised on the ISIS claim and doubts are being raised on its intention
 is katleam or baaki mazdooron kii rihaai ke liye syrian maamalon par najar rakhanevaale ek antarrashtriya maanavadhikaar sanghathan ne bhi is maamle main dakhal diya he
 So that at least the lives of the remaining innocents can be saved
 duusari tarfaies ke hamale ke baadase hi cement factory main sannata pasra hua he
 ISIS fighters are said to still occupy the factory
 philhal ye saaf nahin ho sakaa he ki aies ne itani badi taadaad main mazdooron ko kyon apana nishaanaa banaaya? is cementr factory yaa isamen kaam karne vaale mazdooron se aakhir uski kya dushmani thi?kya kam ho rahi he bagdadi kii takat?kya bagdadi kii ye haivaaniyat iesas ke kamjor hone kii nishaani he? yaa bagdadi is katleam ke jariye ye bataane kii koshish kar rahaa he ki uski jameen abhi kamjor nahin hui he? haal main jis tarah se syria or iraq main aies ke thikaanon par lagaataar hamale hue hai usase naa sirf bagdadi kii takat kam hui he balki in hamalon kii vajah se hi ab lagaataar saria or iraq main uske kabje vaale ilaake ek-ek kar uske haathon se nikalate ja rahe hai
 On one hand, the cruel game of Baghdadi has continued, on the other hand the story of the ruin of Baghdadi is also being written everyday
 syria ke shahar dairyjor se ai ye taaja tasviren bagdadi kii barbaadi kii hi daastaan suna rahi hai
 ISIS annihilated through tanks: At the moment, there is just a last-minute battle between the Syrian army and Baghdadi militants in the eastern region of Dirijor
 or isi ladaai se tay hona he ki ye shahar syrian sena ke kabje main waapas aayega yaa phir iesas yahaan apane jhande fahraayega
 Leading this last battle is the Syrian army's Brigadier General Isam Jehreddin
 vahi general jisase iesas ke aatankwaadi buree tarah khauf khate hai
 Syrian army knows that it is not so easy to drive IS out of here
 isliye jang main tinkon ko bhi utaara jaataa he
 IS has lost half the battle as soon as the tank lands in the battlefield
 iraq se ISIS ko khaded rahi he senaek-ek kar ab iraq ke un tamaam shaharon ko iraqi fouj waapas jeet rahi he jin par iesas ke khalipha bagdadi ne kabja kar rakhaa tha
 But you must have only heard the news of winning these cities back from IS
 aaj ham aapako baqayada jang or jeet ke wo video dikhaaenge
 Will show how the Iraqi army's most dangerous shooters, the snipers, have selectively killed IS militants
 bagdadi ne apane aatank kii kahani iraq se hi shuru kii thi
 On sight, it made the situation worse than the civil war in Iraq
 iraq main mili shuruuaati kamyaabi ke baad hi usne syria kaa rukh kiya tha
 But now Baghdadi is facing the most challenge in the same Iraq

 Minister Satyendra Jain, who is responsible for several important portfolios in the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government, attacked the BJP fiercely in the Delhi Assembly on Tuesday
 ceiling se tang vyapaariyon kii pareshaani bataate hue jain ne kaha ki chunaav main sabase bada samarthan dene vaale vyapaariyon ko bijepi ne murgi bana diya he
 
 satyendra jain ne modi sarkaar or bijepi shasitamsidike faislon par chun-chunakar waar kiya
 Jain said that the BJP was the first to ban demonetisation against the traders and the BJP brokerage to change the note
 iske baad bijepi waalon ne bina taiyaari ke jiesti lagu kar diya or ab desh me epadiai kaa virodh karne vaali bijepi ne 100 fisadi epadiai lagu kar di he
 Jain further said that BJP will stop half of the country's business by 2021
 hindustan ko bijepi africa banane kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 The BJP has a strategy behind ruining the traders
 bijepi vaale kisaanon kii tarah vyapaariyon ko bhi aatmahatya karne ke liye majaboor karenge
 In the assembly, Jangpura MLA Pravin Deshmukh raised the issue of parking of Rs 200 crore in his area, then in response Satyendra Jain surrounded the BJP
 jain ne kaha ki praveen deshmukh ke ilaake main 200 karod rupee kii laagat se parking ban rahi he
 Surprisingly, 350 vehicles have to be parked here
 bijepi vaale kis hisaab se 70 lakh kii ek vaahan kii parking banaate hai
 No one has a car worth Rs 70 lakh
 haalanki dukaanon kii ceiling or kanvarjan charge par shahari vikaas mantri satyendra jain ne khulkar jawaab nahin diya
 Instead of stating the government's stand, he continued to accuse the BJP of corruption

 The comments kyonki aap jaanate hi hai ki soshal media par sahi khabaron kii jagah phek news kaa sansar badhata ja rahaa he
 The director general of the BBC has said that we cannot edit the entire internet but cannot even sit on the shore
 iske liye bibisi ke bheetar intelligence unit banaai ja rahi he jo tamaam phek news kii tathyaparak jaanch kar uskaa bhandaphod karegaa
 You will see that most of the fake news is being spread by political organizations and their supporters only
 media bhi phek news banane main kam nahin he
 In India also, similar efforts are being made on many websites and news channels like News Laundry, Scroll
in, Wire
in, Gujarat of Gujarat, but still the web of fake news continues to spread
 bibisi ne is chunauti ko abhiyaan ke taur par sweekaar kiya he
 Facebook has also announced to form a team to investigate fake news
 bibisi kii yah baat dilachasp he ki hamen slo news kii zarurat he
 Which has depth, data, search, analysis and expertise
 aap channelon par speed news dekhte honge, dikhne se pehle hi khabar nikal jaati he, sunai dene se pehle hi gaadi platform chhod kar ja chuki hoti he
 The programs of Speed news get a lot of ratings which do not have everything that the Director General of BBC is talking about
 kehete hai america main media ko lekar jo ho rahaa he bharat main bhi ho chukaa he
 Because you know that instead of the right news on social media, the world of fake news is increasing
 bibisi ke diarector general ne kaha he ki ham sara internet to sampadit nahin kar sakate magar kinare bhi nahin baith sakate
 For this, an intelligence unit is being created within the BBC which will fact-check all fake news and expose it
 aap dekhenge ki zyaadaatar phek news raajnneetik sanghathanon or unke samarthakon dwaara hi failaaye ja rahe hai
 Media is also no less in making fake news
 bharat main bhi news laundry, scrol dot in, vir daat in, tajnth of gujarat jaisi kai website or gaahe bagaahe channelon par bhi is tarah kii koshish ho rahi he magar phir bhi phek news kaa jaal failata hi ja rahaa he
 The BBC has accepted this challenge as a campaign
 fasebuk ne bhi phek news kii jaanch ke liye team banane kaa elaan kiya he
 The bbc's interesting thing is that we need slow news
 jisamen gaharaai ho, aankade hon, khoj ho, vishleshan ho or visheshgyata ho
 You must have seen speed news on the channels, the news gets out before it appears, the car has left the platform before it is heard
 speed news ke kaaryakramon ko kaaphi reating milti he jinamein wo sab kuch nahin hota jisaki baat bibisi ke diarector general kar rahe hai
 It is said that what is happening about the media in America has also happened in India
 aap channelon par speed news dekhte honge, dikhne se pehle hi khabar nikal jaati he, sunai dene se pehle hi gaadi platform chhod kar ja chuki hoti he
 The programs of Speed news get a lot of ratings which do not have everything that the Director General of BBC is talking about
 kehete hai america main media ko lekar jo ho rahaa he bharat main bhi ho chukaa he

 — Sourav Ganguly (@sganguly99)september 16, 2017 Baba with chaur (rice), this identity has become that of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh
 garibon main antyoday shrenee ko ek ru
 And the rest of BPL will get two
 kii dar se har maheene 35 kilo chaaval dene kii safal yojana ne unhen yah naam diya
 Despite over half the districts being affected by Naxalite, this small state has made a big dent in just a decade of its establishment
 unhen media kii surkhiyaan paane kii bajaae chupchaap apana kaam karne main vishwaas he
 But his work only brings him into the limelight
 varsh 2011 main desh hi nahin, duniya main bhi raman singh surkhiyon main rahe or vishwa bank, supreme court, centre sarkaar, nau rajya, britain or anya deshon se aae kaarydalon ne rajya kii saarvajanik vitaran pranali (peedies) kii mukt kanth se saraahna kii
 The result of the state's strong PDS system was that the small state became the highest rice producer in 2011 and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh conferred the Krishi Karman Award to the state
 supreme court ne apni banaai haai power cameti kii sifarish ke baad 2011 main hi centre sarkaar ko nirdesh diya ki chhattisgarh kii computerikrut peedies pranali ko lagu kiya jaae, jiske baad kendriya khaadya mantralay ne sabhi rajyon ko chitthee likhakar is disha main kadam aage badhaane kii salaah di
 Raman Singh says of his 2011 achievements, "the PDS of the state got national recognition and i consider the initiative to create nine additional districts as a great leap forward in the direction of development and people's trust
 ''swatantraaa diwas ke maukey par mukhyamantri ne prashasan ko aam janata ke or kareeb le jane ke makasad se raturaat nau nae jile banane kii ghoshnaa kar vipaksh ke saath-saath apano ko bhi chaunkaa diya
 Singh, who has been holding the chief minister's chair for eight years in the state, is such that a situation of confrontation between the power and the organization in general never happened and it was resolved even at the state level itself
 sanghathan ke varisht netaaon se unki har mudde par charchaa hoti he, jo behatar samanvay kii misaal he
 Though he faced many allegations from the opposition this year and also came a no-confidence motion in the assembly, but confident Raman Singh says, "in the last eight years, the opposition only kept accusing, but not a single allegation was proved and neither Only cases were registered
 janata kaa mujh par vishwaas he, isliye avishvaas prastaav girnaa hi tha
 The model PDS of Chhattisgarh is truly a classic example of political will
 mahaj ek upachunaav kii haar ne raman singh ko aisa jhakzora ki unhone peedies main badlaav kii thaan lee or 23 karod ru
 The entire system changed in six months at a cost of Rs
 computerikrut tantra ke jariye kisaanon se dhan kii kharidari or maukey par hi kisaanon ko bhugtan kii nai pranali ne kisaanon or upabhoktaaon kii takadir badal di
 His style of work can also be gauged from the commentary of Geeta Bai, 60 years old, living in the slum colony of Khamardih of Raipur
 gita bai ko nahin maaloom ki peedies kii vyavastha main badlaav kaise aayaa, lekin ve chehre par sukun kaa bhav jaahir karte hue kahati hai, ''pehle rashan ke liye dukandaaron ke aage chirori kerani padati thi
 But now rice, wheat, salt is available every month without any effort
 ''naksalwad ko rajya ke vikaas main badi chunauti qaraar dete hue raman singh daawa karte hai ki ab is mudde ko rashtriya sandarbh main sochaa or samaj jane laga he
 It is said that if someone coming to Raipur wishes to meet the Chief Minister, he goes together
 pichley aath saal se raman singh har guuruuvaar ko jandarshan kaarykram main hajaar-dedh hajaar logon kii samasya sun maukey par hi samaadhaan karte rahe hai
 His biggest specialty is his personal political intelligence, from which he receives feedback
 lekin chhattisgarh main bhaajapa kaa ekmaatr cheharaa hone ke baavjood saral swabhaav kii vajah se raman singh centre main narendra modi jaisi thasak nahin bana paae hai
 Attending Delhi court on every issue is his weakness
 lekin ve kismat ke dhani kahe jate hai, jo andruni virodhon ke baavjood janata main priy hai
 Because of his image, he is more friendly in the central government than the party and he easily gets all the work done by the state from the center
 lekin aisa bhi nahin he ki ve puri tarah nishcint ho sakate hai

 bollywood adaakara shridevi kaa shanivaar ko dubai main nidhan ho gaya or abhi tak shridevi kaa shav bharat nahin laayaa gaya he
 It is being told that the dead body of Sridevi can be brought to India by Monday evening
 khabaron ke anusaar kuch niyamon or kanoonee prakriya kii vajah se shridevi ke parthiv sharir ko bharat laane main deree ho rahi he
 However, the Ambassador and Embassy of India in Dubai are trying to complete the process at the earliest
 darasal videsh se kisi bhi vyakti ke parthiv sharir ko laane ke kai kanoon prakriyaaon se guzarana hota he
 Let's know what is the process through which the body can be brought to India
 
 
 agar dubai kii baat karen to kisi bhi shaks kii saamaanya paristhitiyon main maut ho jane par shav ko laane main chaar din tak lag sakate hai or yah samay bad bhi saktaa he
 In the normal circumstances, death does not take much time and legal action increases
 is sthiti main yah samay kai dinon tak bad saktaa he
 According to Emirates 24-7, a lawyer familiar with the case in Dubai says the process is lengthy
 is vajah se padhai bich main chhod shridevi ko filmon main aana padaa- kisi bhi shaks kii maut ho jane ke baad aspataal kii ore se maut kaa diclaration lenaa hota he or uske baad local police stesan se baat kerani hoti he
 After which the Dubai Police issues a No Objection Certificate and then a death certificate
 us mrityu pramaan patr ke aadhaar par aage kii prakriya tay kerani hoti he
 The cause of death is also written in this death certificate
 - mrityu pramaan milane ke baad vija yaa labar card ko lekar kaam karnaa hota he
 In this process, the visa or labor card of the deceased has to be canceled by the Ministry of Labor and Department of Immigration
 agar koi vija lekar dubai gaya hua hota he to uske vija par karrwai hoti he
 - After the visa is canceled, the family of the deceased has to make a cargo booking
 ek baar cargo booking kii prakriya hone ke baad airline canfarmeshan letters ke saath phir se aspataal se baat kerani hoti he, jahaan imbleming certificate or no objection letters airport ko jari kiya jaataa he
 The process may be different if the VIP person dies
 aisa tha shridevi kaa filmi kariyar, shuruyaat main nahin bol paati thim hindi- in teenon dastavejon kaa kaam puraa hone ke baad bhartiya duutavas se sampark karnaa hota he
 After the death register, the Embassy of India issues a death certificate and cancels the passport of the deceased
 uske saath hi medical kaagajon kii jaankaree lekar airport ko body le jane ke liye ek letters jari karata he
 - During this time these documents are necessary
 -medical report-mrityu pramaan patr-police report (angreji main anuwaad hona aavashyak he)- passport or vija kii copy- anya dastavejabta den ki yah prakriya har desh ke sthaneey niyamon ke aadhaar par badale ja sakate hai or uske aadhaar par prakriya puri kii jaati he
 The delay in bringing Sridevi's body is still being said that Sridevi died due to cardiac arrest but it cannot be confirmed until the post-mortem report is made
 sthaneey media gulf news ne kaha he ki agar report main pataa chalata he ki unki maut heart atake yaa cardia arest se nahin hui he to shav milane main or bhi deree ho sakati he
 Right now the blood and viscera report of Sridevi is awaited
 abhi toxicology report kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Under this, blood, organ will be examined
 agar maut saadhaaran nahin pai jaati he to jaanch aage bad sakati he

 President Pranab Mukherjee has described the Emergency of 1975 as an 'avoidable event' and an 'audacious move'
 diggaj congressi rahe pranab ne kaha ki us vakt kii pradhanmantri indira gandhi ko isaki baari keemat chukaani padi
 The President acknowledged that the suspension of fundamental rights and political activity, mass arrests and press censorship during that time had a bad effect

 However, he still did not spare the then opposition led by Jayaprakash Narayan
 unhone pranab ke andolan ko ‘dishaheen’ bataaya he
 Mukherjee in his book 'the Dramatic Decade: The Indira Gandhi Years' has written his thoughts about the biggest turbulent period in the history of post-independence India
 pustak haal hi main relies hui he
 'indira was not aware of the provisions' He has revealed that the provisions of the Emergency imposed in 1975 were not known to the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and on the suggestion of the then Chief Minister of West Bengal Siddharth Shankar Rai, he took this decision

 The 321-page book, written by the President, "could have been avoided", highlighted the liberation of Bangladesh, the JP movement, the defeat in the 1977 elections, the Partition in Congress, the return to power in 1980 and subsequent developments

 'mukherjee wrote,' Suspension of fundamental rights and political activity (including labor organization activity), mass arrests of political leaders and activists, press censorship and extending the tenure of legislatures without holding elections are some of the incidents of emergency Adversely affected interests
 congress or indira gandhi ko is dussahasik kadam kii baari keemat chukaani padi
 "the Emergency was started on the suggestion of the CM of Bengal", in 1975, recalling the dramatic moments of the Emergency's announcement just minutes before midnight on 25 June in 1975, he wrote that it was the suggestion of the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, Rai And Indira Gandhi implemented that
 unhone likhaa he, ‘indira gandhi ne mujhase baad main kaha ki andruni gadabadi ke aadhaar par immergency ke elaan kii ijaajat dene vaale sanvaidhanik praavdhaanon se to vah waakif bhi nahin thim khaskar aisi sthiti main jab 1971 ke bharat-pakistan yuddh ke chalate pehle se hi apatkaal lagaaya ja chukaa tha
 Mukherjee said that Rai, the then member of the Congress Working Committee and the Central Parliamentary Board, was among Indira Gandhi's 'most influential advisers' and her views were taken on different issues
 (input: bhashaa) The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has conducted a survey of dangerous buildings in Delhi
 is survey main khatarnaak imaaraton ko lekar behad hairaan or chaunkaane vaale aankade saamne aae hai
 In this survey, MCD has found only 50 buildings in 21 lakh in dilapidated and dangerous conditions in the entire Delhi
 barish ke mausam main imaarat girane ke haadason kaa shikaar hone vaali dilli main in aankadon par yakeen karnaa mushkil hi nahin balki naammumkin he
 Would you believe that there are only 50 dilapidated buildings all over Delhi? But this is what the MCD report is saying
 dilli kii danger imaaraton ko lekar kiye gaye survey main sabase chaunkaane vaale aankade south emsidi ke hai
 The South MCD has not found a single dangerous building in its areas
 monsoon se pehle south emsidi kii taraf se south, west, centre or najafagarh jone main khatarnaak imaaraton kii talash karne ke liye ek survey karaayaa gaya
 In this survey, 9 lakh 94 thousand 157 houses were surveyed
 magar hairaani kii baat he ki lakhon makaanon main se south emsidi ko ek bhi imaarat khatarnaak nahin mili
 Surprising figures of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation are also no less surprising
 south emsidi kii tarah east emsidi ne bhi monsoon se pehle khatarnaak imaaraton kii pahchaan karne ke liye ek survey kiya
 East MCD surveyed 3 lakh 90 thousand houses
 isamen east emsidi ko sirf ek aisi imaarat mili, jisko khatarnaak mana gaya
 While it is not hidden from anyone that East Delhi is full of illegal and unauthorized colonies
 vahiin north emsidi ke survey main sirf 49 imaaraten khatarnaak pai gayi
 North MCD surveyed 7 lakh 58 thousand 206 buildings
 sabase zyada khatarnaak imaaraten city espi jone main pai gayi, jahaan khatarnaak imaaraton kii sankhya 26 he
 While 18 in Narela zone, 3 in Rohini zone, civil line and Karolbagh, 1-1 buildings in Paharganj zone were found dangerous
 vipaksh ne uthaae sawalamasidi kii is report par vipaksh kii ore se bhi sawaal khadey kiye gaye
 Congress councilor Abhishek Dutt challenged the MCD to take an affidavit from its officials if they had such confidence in their report, in which they would be responsible for a building accident
 dilli main har monsoon kii barish main kai jarjar imaaraten maut kii imaaraten sabit hoti hai
 In such a situation, these figures of MCD cannot be believed and if these figures are to be believed, then this aerial survey can put a lot of lives on many people

 If you do nine to 10 then the Factories Act will come into force

 With this reform, the government wants to make business easier
 vivaadaaspad sudhaar prastaavpichhali loksabhaa ke dauraan sarkaar mushkil main funs gai jab trade unionon kii ore se tamaam shram kanoonon ko chaar samhitaon main sametane kaa tikhaa virodh hua
 The major disputed reforms were the following: Membership and structure of trade unions: The Industrial Relations Code of 2017 states that at least 10% of the workers working in it or 100 workers working in it to register a trade union in an establishment or industry
 would be required
 yah maujuuda vakt main 7% he
 It prohibits being a member of a worker outside the relevant establishment or industry
 do unionon kaa sadsy hone se roktaa he
 It also provides that any person from outside the respective establishment who is in a position of profit (outside the establishment) can neither become a member of the union nor take an official position in the union
 trade unionon ne iskaa virodh kiya
 The rss-linked Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) and the left-wing labor organization Center of Indian Trade Union (CITU) say such a change should not happen
 BMS ke adhyaksh sike sajinarayan kehete hai ki yah trade unionon kaa nirnay hona chahie ki ve kise sadsy or kise netaa chunate hai
 "it is not the government's job to decide"
 CITU ke mahasachiv tapan sen ke vichaar bhi isse milte julate hai ki privet sector main union banane ke liye itani badi sankhya main sadsy milane mushkil hote hai
 If the company takes retaliatory action, there is no one to protect them in the absence of the union
 ve rashtriya rajdhani kshetra kii ek automobile company kaa udhaaharan dete hai jahaan par union kaa gathan karne ke liye sansad ke hastkshep kii jarurat padi
 However, the industry's view on this is different
 siaiai kii neshnal cameti on industrial relation ke chairman emes unnikrishnan kaa kehete hai, industry to chaahegi ki aage is seemaa ko badha diya jaae, ek pratishthan main sirf ek union ho or in ikaayiyon kaa chupa hua raajnneetik judaav khatm kar diya jaae
 Recruitment and retrenchment: The Industrial Relations Code of 2017 provided that there is no need to seek government permission to retrench up to 300 employees
 philhal yah sankhya 100 he
 This was the most disputed provision of this code
 trade union aise sudhaaron or parivartanon kaa kadaa virodh kar rahe hai
 BMS says that due to the mechanism, the company which previously required 100 workers, will now employ 20 to 30 people
 isliye is seemaa ko neeche laana chahie
 The CITU is of the view that if the rules for recruitment and retrenchment are further liberalized, the threat to workers will increase
 jaij maang rakhane par bhi unhen nikaal phenkaa jayega
 But the industry is thinking differently
 unnikrishnan kaa kahana he ki industry ko avyavhaarik ikaayiyon ko chalaane ke liye majaboor nahin karnaa chahie or yah bhartee or chantni kaa niyam nahin he balki yah to bijness policy he
 According to him, we want the limit of retrenchment which is being reduced from 100 to 300 to be increased further
 hadtaal par pratibandh:in dustrial relation code aaf 2017 hadtaal par bhi pratibandh lagaataa he
 Accordingly, the notice will have to be given 14 days before the strike and the strike will have to be done within two months of the notice
 abhi sirf jaruri suvidhaon ke maamle notice kii jarurat hoti he
 It also provides that if the process of settlement is going on after the notice, then the strike will be banned from the day of notice
 yah kanoon yah bhi praavdhaan karata he ki ukt niyam kaa ulanghan karne par 50,000 jurmaana or ek maheene jail kii sajaa hogi
 Trade unions believe it is indirectly like banning strikes and protests
 sajinarayan kehete hai ki 'yah puri tarah se kamgaaron ke mul adhikaron kaa ulanghan he
 The industry thinks the opposite
 pramukh maanav sansaadhan company timlij services ke rituparn chakrabarti kehete hai ki hadtaal se kisi kii madad nahin ho sakati
 Instead, an environment should be created where issues can be resolved and mutual distrust can be eradicated
 unnikrishnan bhi isi vichaar kaa samarthan karte hue management se bhidane kii jagah najariye main parivartan kii jarurat bataate hai
 Ignoring Social Security: The second disputed provision of this law is that it bypasses the issue of social security and makes a single system to resolve all issues of social security and welfare
 sabhi tarah ke kamgaaron jaise part time, cajual, nishchit avadhi ke varkar, gharelu kamgaaron aadi sabake liye pension, provident fund, medical suvidhaayen aadi ke liye ek hi praadhikaran hoga
 It has merged 15 central laws
 train union sabhi tarah ke kamgaaron ko saamaajik suraksha dene kaa to swaagat karte hai, lekin unka kahana he ki asangathit kshetra ke kamgaaron ke liye alag praadhikaran hona chahie
 Some will suffer if the organizations and funds of the workers of organized and unorganized sectors are clubbed together
 haalanki, udyog jagat kaa maananaa he ki sabhi tarah ke kamgaaron ko ek hi shrenee main rakh dene se kanoonee jatiltaayen khatm ho jaaengi
 Redefine the factory: The government has proposed several amendments to the Factories Act 1948
 aisa kamgaaron kii suraksha, swasthya or kalyaan ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 The factory definition stipulates that if electricity is used, there will be a minimum of 10 to 20 workers and if electricity is not used, there will be a minimum of 20 to 40 workers, only then it will be considered as a factory
 unionon kaa kahana he ki is tarah se badi sankhya main kaamgaar sangathit kshetra se baahar ho jaaenge
 Labor law should apply to all types of workers, even if there is only one worker in a factory
 ab yah dekhnaa he ki sarkaar industry or trade unionon kii aakankshaon ke bich talmail kaise baitha paati he? The picture of a blue dog in Taloja, adjacent to Mumbai, has gone viral on social media nowadays
 sthaneey logon kaa aarope he ki ilaake main maujuud udyog shahar ke nadi main dooshit pani chhodte hai jiskaa asar ilaake ke pashuon par pad rahaa he
 It is being alleged that five dogs in the area have died after taking a dip in the Kasadi river present in the city
 nadi main bade dooshit pani ke liye ilaake main maujuud udyogon ko jimmedaar mana ja rahaa he
 The comments bachapan se taloja main rahane vaale 45 varshiya deenanath kamble ne bhi mana he ki shahar main bade udyogon se pani dooshit ho gaya he jiske baad unke ilaake ke logon ne pani main janaa band kar diya
 But the Taloja Manufacturers Association is not considering the contaminated water coming out of the industry as the main reason for changing the color of the dogs and sees the whole matter as a conspiracy
 is bich nile rang main tabdeel ho gaye kute kii haalat abhi thik he or wo ab apane puraane rang main bhi laut rahaa he
 The 45-year-old Dinanath Kamble, who has lived in Taloja since childhood, has also admitted that water has been contaminated by the growing industries in the city, after which people of his area stopped going into the water

 It is not about playing big shots, one has to play the role of holding one end and the batsman with him can play big shots

 This book has been published by Yash Publishers and Distributors
 isi maheene 12 taarikh ko hajaaron kisaanon-adivaasiyon kaa kafila paanch dinon tak khamoshi se paidal chalate hue mumbai pahunchaa
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis returned them by assuring them of their demands
 isi tarah ab se 58 saal pehle congress ke raipur adhiveshan ke vakt kareeb 40,000 adivasee jal, jangal or jameen par apane haq kii maang karte hue pahunche the, or tab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru ne unase milakar aisa hi aashwaasan diya tha
 The tribals have a long history of demands and assurances in return
 lekin adivaasiyon kii tarah unke nayakon or unke sangharsh kaa itihaas bhi upekshit he
 One of them is Lal Shyam Shah, who has become a legend among the tribals
 kareeb sau saal pehle janme shah aaj ke rajanandgaanv jile main jameendaari riyasat mohala-panabaras ke jameendaar the
 Shah, who was elected twice as an independent MLA from the post and once an MP from Chanda (now Chandrapur), spent just one day in Parliament in 1964 and resigned after being upset
 unhone istife main likhaah ''ham adivasee aise log hai, jo apane hi desh main sharnaarthi hai
 "the demand for grant of separate state Gondwana status to areas of tribal-dominated Central Province was unheard of by Shah," When new states are being established on cultural, geographical and historical grounds, what is the neglect of our demand for Gondwana province? Is not gross injustice? ”chhattisgarh became a state 12 years after his death in 1988
 tab rajya kii 90 vidhansabha siton main se 34 adivaasiyon ke liye arakshit thim, jinaki sankchaya ab ghatakar 29 ho gai he! yani ek baar phir anyaay!patrkaar sudeep thakur shah ke parichay se pehle 22 june, 1897 ko landan main maharani victoria ke shashan kii hirak jayanti kii tasviir khinchne kii koshish karte hue aise lagate hai maano aath varshiya arnald toinbi kii najaron se sara manjar dekh rahe hon
 But historian Toynbee may not have seen the box sent by Stanley W
 Coxon, then deputy commissioner of the Chanda district in Central Provinces
 stanley ke hawaale se ve us jamaane ke samaaj or phir shah kii kahani bayaan karte hai
 Thakur has divided the entire story into different chapters
 lekin isamen koi kalpana nahin he kyonki unhone tathyon ko jutaney ke liye puraane dastavej, gajet, akhbaar, vidhansabha or sansad ke record khangale hai, ilaake main gum-ghumkar logon se baat kii he, shah ke rishtedaaron-parichiton se milakar gahan shodh kiya he
 Well-versed with the geography, history and society of the region, Thakur actually narrates the story of the political-social struggle of the tribals indirectly while telling the story of Shah, which is quite interesting

 a historic temple has reopened after a 10-year hiatus in Peshawar city of Pakistan

 Samajwadi Party President Mulayam Singh Yadav took credit for the inclusion of Salman Khurshid in the Union Cabinet and the appointment of Beni Prasad Verma as Minister of State and said that Salman Khurshid's inclusion in the Union Cabinet is the result of the statement of SP leader Azam Khan and Beni himself was made Minister of State for Steel because of his remarks
 yadav ne yahaan varisht sapa netaa janeshwar mishra kii punyatithi par yojit shradhanjali samaaroh main kaha ‘salmaan khurshid kii cabinet mantri ke taur par padonnati ajam khan kii vajah se hui he
 If Khan did not raise the issue of neglect of Muslims in the Union Cabinet, Khurshid would not have become a minister
 khurshid ko jaakar khan se aashirwad lenaa chaiye
 'it is worth mentioning that Azam Khan said last month that Muslims have been neglected in the Union Cabinet and that there is only one Muslim minister in the form of Ghulam Nabi Azad and he also belongs to Kashmir, whose geography is not fixed yet
 Whether he is a part of India or not
 kabhi yadav kaa dahinaa haath kahe jane vaale or baad main alag hokar congress ke tikat par saansad chune gaye benny prasad verma kaa zikr hone par sapa adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘benny to meri tippanee kii vajah se rajyamantri banaae gaye hai varanaa unhen yah ohada bhi nahin miltaa
 "yadav said" We told Beni that he was losing himself in the Congress
 isse acha he ki vah mere paas khadey ho jaaen
 Only after that Beni was made the Minister of State
 benny aise dal main hai jahaan na unki vichaardhaara mail khaati he or na hi vah unke liye acha he
 Recognizing the remarks made by Azam Khan about Kashmir as an objectionable statement, Yadav once again reacted strongly to a case of treason against him in compliance with a court order of Badaun

 After winning the gold medal at the Glasgow Commonwealth, Jitu won the silver medal at the World Championship in Granada, Spain
 iske baad inchion asian games main unhone do padak jite
 After Jitu Rai's success in the Incheon Asian Games, everyone in India is praising his consistency
 diggaj nishanebaaj samaresh jang ke mutabik bhartiya nishanebaaji kii duniya main lambey samay ke baad kisi ne aisi conssitency dikhaai he
 The special thing about Jeetu is that despite the successes, his feet are still on the ground

 Commitment to practice continuously and the passion to improve one's own performance
 jab nazren rio olympic par tiki hon to phir in gunon ke sahare hi kamyaabi hasil kii ja sakati he
 Midnight Army personnel created a ruckus at Haridwar railway station on Wednesday midnight
 kathgodam express main savaar hue army ke kareeb dedh darjan javaanon ne bheed ko vyavasthit kar rahe jiarapy ke do sipaahiyon ko jamkar peet diya
 The anger of the army soldiers was that they beat a soldier and threw him on the railway track
 ganimat ye rahi ki us samay railway treks se koi train nahin guzar rahi thi
 Seeing the information about the incident, most of the army personnel got into the moving train after seeing the police
 do javaanon ko police ne dhar dabocha

 The soldiers fiercely beat up the GRP soldiers
 vahin jiarapy prabharee kaa kahana he ki is maamle main gorkha regiment ke do javaanon ko giraftaar kar mukadmaa darj kiya ja rahaa he
 But now after being arrested, these army soldiers are telling themselves innocent
 inaki maane to marpet karne waalon main ye shaamil nahin the
 This is not the first case of a quarrel between the GRP and the army at Haridwar railway station

 desh ke tamaam khilaadi, netaa or chaahane vaale bhale hi master blaster sachin tendulkar ko desh ke sabase bade naagarik sammaan ‘bharat ratna’ dene kii maang kar rahe hon, lekin sambandhit kaayade kanoon badale bina unhen is sarvocch naagarik sammaan se nahin nawaja ja saktaa
 The country's highest civilian honor Bharat Ratna was instituted in 1954
 tab se ab tak 41 vyaktiyon ko isse vibhooshit kiya ja chukaa he, lekin inamen se koi bhi khilaadi nahin he, vajah sambandhit niyam hai
 Constitution expert Subhash Kashyap says, "at the moment, he (sachin) does not fit into it (to award Bharat Ratna)
" jab tak inhen (niyamon ko) badla nahin jaataa, ve feet nahin baithte
 "bharat Ratna according to the rules," this award is given for exceptional service in the development of art, literature and science and in recognition of the highest level of public service
 ’’isamen khel kaa zikr kahin nahin he, jabaki padam puraskaron ke sambandhit niyamon ke tahat ‘yah puraskaar sabhi prakaar kii gatividhiyon, kshetron jaise ki kala, sahitya or shiksha, khel-kud, chikitsa, saamaajik kaary, vigyaan or ejiniyari, saarvajanik maamle, civil seva, vyapaar or udyog aadi main vishisht or asaadhaaran uplabdhiyon, sevaaon ke liye pradaan kiye jate hai
 For this reason, Sachin has been awarded the Padma Vibhushan, the highest civilian honor under the rules, and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, the highest sports honor
 samvidhan visheshgy kashyap kaa kahana he ,‘‘yah nirnay sarkaar ko karnaa hoga ki kya khel ko bharat ratna main joda jaae
 The Home Ministry will have to put such a proposal before the cabinet for approval
 ’’kashyap ne kaha, ‘‘sarkaar kii taraf se grih mantralay pahal kar saktaa he
 If a Member of Parliament or any citizen writes a letter to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry can take cognizance of the same
 vaise vah (mantralay) bhi swayan sangyaan le saktaa he
 After the approval of the cabinet, the Home Ministry can amend the rules and pave the way for awarding Bharat Ratna to any player, not just Sachin
 apane prashansakon ke bich ‘cricket kaa bhagwaan’ maane jane vaale sachin ko bharat ratna dene kii maang sansad hi nahin vidhansabhaon main bhi baar-baar uth chuki he
 This demand was unanimously raised in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly recently
 bhartiya cricket team ke sadsy mahendra singh dhoni, harbhajan singh, yuvaraj singh or virendra sahvaag jaise maujuuda khilaadiyon sahit kai purv cricketer sachin ko bharat ratna dene kii maang kar chuke hai
 While the Padma Awards selection process is quite long, no formal recommendation is needed for the Bharat Ratna
 sambandhit niyamon ke mutabik, ‘‘bharat ratna ke liye sifarish swayan pradhanmantri dwaara raashtrapati ko kii jaati he
 No formal recommendation is required for this
 ’’haalanki kendra main mantri rah chuke or ucchtam nyaayalay ke varisht adhivaktaa jagadeep dhankhad ke mutabik sarkaar chaahe to bina niyam badale bhi lok seva varg ke tahat kisi ko bharat ratna puraskaar diya ja saktaa he
 On the fact that the Bharat Ratna did not include a class of players, he said, "this (amendment) process is neither complicated nor impractical

 philhal durghatana ke kaarnon kaa thik-thik pataa nahin chal paaya he, lekin is sambandh jaanch kii ja rahi he
 On Monday, loudspeakers rang throughout the day to react to the idea of famous singer Sonu Nigam, in which he questioned the indiscriminate use of loudspeakers from temples, mosques and gurdwaras
 lekin unke nijee vichaar par khub vivaad hua
 The question is why people who make noise do not play loudspeakers on the real issues when it comes to religion
 teen talaak aisa hi mudda he
 First Prime Minister Modi and then Yogi Adityanath have given big hints by offering frowns on the triple talaq
 yogi ne teen talaak kii tulana draupadi ke chiraharan se kii or maun rahane waalon ko aade haathon lekar virdohi dalon ko bhi nishane par liya
 Why is Silent on triple talaq? CM Yogi said that if a loud-speaker should be played then it should actually be played on the issue of triple talaq and social and religious evils like halala
 jisase un logon ke aankh or kaan ke parde khulen jo apane matlab ke liye aadhunik bharat main bhi muslim mahilaon ke saath hote anyaay par silent ho jate hai
 Just like in the Mahabharata, the assembly of the Kauravas was silent on seeing Draupadi rippling
 yogi adityanath kii baat moulanaon or rajnatik matlabaparasti vaale netaaon ko katai pasand nahin aegi
 But those people who are not giving up the opportunity to curse someone's personal opinion about the noise of loudspeaker in the name of religion, it is very shocking when the loudspeaker rings against the injustice against Muslim women
 lakhanu kii rukhsana kaa teen talaak ke khilaaf aawajarukhasana se ek nahin do baar unke pati ne shaadi kii or donon baar teen talaak kehake alag kar diya
 For the first time, divorce was called divorce, then the husband had to undergo a malaise like Halala for marriage, married again to her husband
 lekin dobaaraa pati ne maaraa peeta yahaan tak ki jalaayaa or ghar se nikaal diya, do minute main teen talaak kahkar phir se alag kar diya
 Rukhsana was married to Asarukhasana of justice seven years ago
 pehali baar shaadi se do bachche hue
 The husband divorced, then there was pressure on the husband to marry him, then he had to make halala with one member of the family, after which the husband was remarried
 do bachche phir hue, isamen teen saal kii beti bhi he
 7 months ago Rukhsana was tortured and thrown out of the house
 rukhsana kii maa apni beti kii teen talaak se barbaad hui zindagi ke liye nyaay maang rahi hai
 There are painful stories of how many Muslim women, like Rukhsana, whose life did not take long to create a soul in the name of triple talaq
 lekin ab teen talaak se muslim mahilaon kii mukti kii awaz tej ho gai he
 The silence of those who remain silent in the name of religion and against the vote bank against such malpractices is not going to last long
 teen talaak se rehana kii jindagi tabahpilibhit kii rehana kii zindagi main teen talaak kaa tezaab daal diya gaya
 After 18 years of marriage, her husband, living abroad, left the phone three times saying divorce
 iske baad sasuralwale ghar se nikaalane main lag gaye
 When Rehana remained adamant, acid attack occurred on her
 rehana jaisaa kahaniyaan muslim samaaj kii mahilaon kii kadavi sachai ban chuki hai, jinaki zindagi teen talaak ne tabah kar di
 Soni of Nainital is also among the three women divorced for whom justice is being raised
 teen talaak ke khilaaf mahilaon kii buland aawazmuslim mahilaon kii buland hoti awaz or unki awaz kaa saath dete sarkaar or system kaa hi dabaav he ki muslim samaaj ke dharmik thekedaar in kuritiyon ko lekar baikfoot par hai
 The Muslim Personal Law Board, on the issue of triple talaq, spoke for the first time on the Code of Conduct on Sunday, but despite this, they are trying to defend the triple talaq
 modi sarkaar bade faisle ko taiyaartin talaak kaa mudda supreme court main bhi he or janata kii adaalat main bhi he
 This time the government is openly speaking in favor of Muslim women on the issue of triple talaq
 sarkaar ko muslim mahilaon se bada samarthan main mil rahaa he
 That is why again and again the Prime Minister himself has been speaking on the issue of triple talaq
 ravivaar ko piem modi ne bolaa or somvaar ko upi ke siem yogi ne bhi sidhe shabdon main kah diya he, ye teen talaak ke khilaaf muslim mahilaon kii buland hote awaz kaa wolum badhaane ke liye kaaphi he
 It can be seen as a movement of Muslim women to quell triple talaq
 rukhsana jaise mahilaon kii chikhon or dharmik kuritiyon dwaara unke sammaan ke chiraharan par ab aankh kaan band nahin kiye ja sakate
 This is how people misuse triple talaq: 1
 teen talaak muslim mahilaon ke khilaaf gambhir saamaajik aparaadh se kam nahin he kyonki aksar pati apni patni se chhutkaaraa paane ke liye teen talaak kaa istemaal karte hai
 2
 kai baar dahej ke liye, duusari shaadi ke liye teen talaak kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 3
 kai baar garbhvatee mahilaon ko teen talaak dekar chhod diya jaataa he, wo cese tak nahin lard paati hai
 4
 teen talaak ke liye muslim mahila ko samay bhi nahin diya jaataa he
 5
 ek baar main teen talaak dekar muslim mahila ko achaanak beghar kar diya jaataa he
 6
 kai baar phone, letters, whats ap, esemes ke zarie teen talaak de diya jaataa he
 7
 kai baar gusse main talaak diya jaataa he phir dobaaraa nikaah ke liye use halaala se guzaranaa padataa he
 That is, to marry a husband for the second time, one has to marry someone else first
 8
 It is the practice of marrying someone else after marrying someone else and living with them
 zyaadaatar muslim deshon main teen talaak par pratibandh:- pakistan or bangladesh jaise deshon main bhi teen talaak par bain he
 - Even in countries like Morocco, Afghanistan, Jordan, Kuwait, triple talaq does not work
 - algeria, tunisia main bhi court ke baahar koi talaak maanya nahin hota he
 Qazi or court mediation is mandatory before divorce in Malaysia
 in tathyon ko kaise nakaarenge?- 2011 kii janaganana ke mutabik muslim samaaj main 49 fisadi mahilaon kii shaadi 14 se 19 varsh kii umr ke bich ho jaati he
 The issue of triple talaq due to marriage at a young age becomes very worrying for Muslim women
 - kyonki wo naa acchhee tarah se shikshit hoti hai or naa hi aarthik taur par majboot hoti hai, aise main talaak unhen besahaara kar detaa he
 According to a survey by the Indian Muslim Women's Movement Organization, 95 percent of divorced women do not receive alimony
 - isi survey ke mutabik 92 fisadi muslim mahilaayein teen talaak khatm karne or bahuvivaah kii kupratha khatm karne ke paksh main hai
 Significantly, Muslim women are no longer ready to tolerate triple talaq and evils like halala
 laudspikar to baj chukaa he, iskaa wolum badhata ja rahaa he or is awaz ko koi ansuna nahin kar saktaa
 No one can ignore these atrocities, at least in new India

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne guuruuvaar ko od-evan niyam se sambandhit kuch pramukh nirdesh jari kiye hai
 The odd-even rule will be applicable from November 4 to November 15 next month
 kejariwal ne kaha ki niyamon kaa ulanghan karne waalon ko 4 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana dena hoga
 However, in 2016, the fine amount was Rs 2 thousand
 jaaniye od-evan se jude khaas sawaalon ke jawaab
 
 
 1- Will you be able to drive all day in Delhi by paying a fine of Rs 4000 or the vehicle will be returned or confiscated with fine? Under the new Motor Vehicle Act, this time the aud-evens will be implemented from November 4 to November 15
 An invoice of Rs 4000 will have to be given if the rule is broken
 yahaan ye jaananaa jaruri he kiod-evan niyam todane parek baar chaalaan kaate jane ke baad bhi agar dobaaraa us vaahan ko niyam todate paaya gaya to phir se jurmaana dena hoga
 The vehicle will not be seized and the car will be returned with a fine
 ye saaf he ki ek baar niyam todane par, chaalaan cat jane ke baad vaahan ko sadak par nahin chalaa sakenge
 You can park your vehicle in the nearest parking lot to avoid the challan
 2- kin immergency gadiyon ko milegaa chhot?immergency vaahanon main is baar bhi ambulance, fire brigade, jail ke kaidiyon ke vaahan or shav vaahan ko od-evan niyam ke dauraan chhot milegi
 Apart from this, vehicles of Delhi Police have also been kept out of the ambit of aud-even
 saath hi aise log jo apane vaahan main kisi marij ko hospital le ja rahe hon, unhen bharose ke aadhaar par hi immergency chhot di jaaegi
 3- There are children wearing school uniforms but driver gents, if the vehicle is violating the aud-even? If you aud days (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 , 25, 27, 29 and 31) carrying a child wearing a school dress in a vehicle of even number (2,4,6,8,0), you will still be exempt from the rule
 agar gaadi ke andar skool kii dress pahane hue baccha baitha he to chaalak chaahe mahila ho yaa purush use od-evan niyam se chhot milegi
 However, Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot says that the school timings are from 7 am to 7:30 am, so the vehicle will have to come back before 8 pm
 kyonki od-evan niyam subah 8 baje ke baad lagu hoga
 4- How will people from outside or other states know whether there is an aud or even today? As Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced that the odd-even rule will also apply to vehicles coming from other states in Delhi
 aise main desh kii rajdhani main anya rajyon ke vaahanon ko od-evan ke bare main jaagruk karne ke liye sarkaar vigyaapan kii madad legi
 Transport Minister Kailash Gehlot told 'aaj Tak' that this time due to the new Motor Vehicle Act, the penalty will be higher
 aise main jitne bhi rajya hai vahaan ke akhabaaron main vigyaapan dekar dilli main od-evan niyam kii jaanakri di jaaegi
 Partner Kailash Gehlot said that large hoardings will also be put in place about the entry-point points or borders at Delhi from other states
 5- agar kisi ko jaananaa ho ki aaj od he yaa evan, to kya-kya tareeke?agar aapaki gaadi kii number plate kaa aakhri number od (1,3,5,7,9) he, to aap 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 or 31 taarikh ko hi gaadi chalaa sakate hai
 Similarly, if the last number of your car is even (2,4,6,8,0), then you will get 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,18, 20, 22, 24, 26 of the month
 , 28, 30 can only drive the car out
 aise main ghar se nikalne se pehle taarikh or gaadi kii plate kaa aakhri number jarur dekh len
 6- How to know the number odd or even based on the number of the vehicle? Odd-even means that the last number of your car's numberplate is even or odd
 is formule main dilli kii sadakon par ek din od or uske agle din evan number kii gaadiyaan chalaane kaa niyam hota he
 In the language of mathematics, 1,3,5,7 and 9 are called odd numbers, similarly 2,4,6,8 and 0 are called even numbers
 dilli main 4 november se 15 november 2019 tak od-evan niyam lagu hoga
 This means that on November 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 of November 2019, vehicles of even number will run on the roads
 jabaki november 2019 kii 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 or 15 taarikh ko od number ke vaahanon ko sadakon par chalane kii anumati hogi

 RJD MLA Bhai Virendra has opened a front against the head of state Nitish Kumar
 virendra kaa kahana he ki mahagathbandhan sarkaar ko logon ne vot dekar banaaya tha, lekin unke liye kaam nahin ho rahaa he
 Bureaucracy dominates here
 virendra ne saath hi kaha kiprakash utsav or sharabbandijaisi chizein bas cheharaa chamakaane ke liye kii ja rahi hai
 The RJD MLA alleged that despite the prohibition of alcohol in the state, home delivery of liquor is being done today
 report karne par afasar koi karrwai nahin karte he
 Law of prohibition has been made, but the police officers themselves are selling liquor
 virendra kaa aarope he ki unhone report kiya, lekin us afasar ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin hui
 He says, "the liquor mafia remains sitting with the police till date
 un par koi karrwai nahin hoti
 The RJD mlas who are part of the ruling coalition also fiercely rage the Janata Dal United (JDU) on the issue of demonetisation
 unka kahana he ki mahagathbandhan main shaamil congress or argedy kaa stand saaf he, lekin jediu kaa rukh is par kyon saaf nahin
 Virendra said, 'JDU should stand with us and fight against the central government
 'bhai virendra yaheen nahin rukate
 He said that without our leader Lalu Prasad Yadav, Nitish Kumar has no existence
 gathbandhan kii sarkaar koi bhi kaam karti he, to keval mukhyamantri kaa cheharaa chamkaaya jaataa he
 Why the face of Lalu Yadav or Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi is not shown
 haalanki bhai virendra kaa kahana he ki argedy gathbandhan ko ekajute rakhane main koi kor kasar nahin chhodeygi
 Their leader Lalu Prasad Yadav can go to any extent to drive away communal powers, but the way the public representatives are being insulted in this government
 shaayad aaazaad hidustan main aisa kabhi nahin hua
 Therefore all are murmurs
 vahiin jediu se jab is babat pratikriya maangi gai, to party ne bhai virendra ke is bayaan ko zyada tavajjon nahin dene kii baat kahi
 Party state president Vasistha Narayan Singh said that some people have personal complaints, they do the same things
 gathbandhan ke str par aisi koi samasya nahin he
 Even though it looks frosty when viewed from above, the top leaders of the grand alliance Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad Yadav and Ashok Chaudhary meet quite intently when they meet
 inamen jo ekajutata he, usko dekhakar yahi lagata he ki mahagathbandhan main jo thodi bahut samasya aegi bhi, to usase ye bakhubi nipat lenge

 purv bhartiya captain kapil dev kaa maananaa he ki jabardast pratibha ke baavjood tej gendbaaj eshanth sharma main lagaataar ‘wicket lene vaali genden’ phenkane kii kshamta kuch kam he
 Although Ishant has been away from cricket for some time and he did not play in the series against New Zealand due to chikungunya, but now he has returned to the team for the England Test starting in Rajkot from 9 November
 unhone 72 maichon main 66
 Has achieved 209 Test wickets at a strike rate of 6
 kapil ne star sports dwaara yojit kaarykram ke dauraan pitiai se kaha, ‘‘mujhe lagata he ki eshanth bahut acha gendbaaj he
 He is a real fast bowler and his length is also good, but he has to produce wicket-taking balls that have the ability to take wickets in the crucial time
 shaayad vah isichis main pichad rahaa he
 There is no lack of talent and ability, but there is a lack of talent to take wickets somewhere
 ’’ kapil ne 131 test main 434 wicket chatkaaye hai, jinamein se zyaadaatar bharat kii aisi pichon main mili hai jo ballebaajon ke anukool thim
 The comments ballebaajon ke mufeed pich par saajhedaariyaan todane ke liye eshanth to kya karnaa chahie, yah poochne par kapil ne kaha, ‘‘gendbaaj ko behatar gend phenkani chahie, lagaataar behatar line evam length main gendbaaji kerani chahie
 It is not that you bowl two very good balls in an over, rather you should bowl five good balls
 iske baad hi aap or wicket hasil kar sakate ho
 '' (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Kapil told PTI during an event organized by Star Sports, "I think Ishant is a very good bowler
 vah vaastavik tej gendbaaj he or uski lambaai bhi acchhee he, lekin use wicket hasil karne vaali gendon ko taiyaar karnaa hoga jo ahm samay main wicket lene kii kshamta rakhti hon
 Perhaps he is lagging behind in this
 usamen pratibha or kshamta kii koi kami nahin he, lekin kahin na kahin wicket chatakaane kii pratibha kii kami he
 Kapil has taken 434 wickets in 131 Tests, most of which have been found in Indian pitches that were friendly to the batsmen
 tippaniyan Asked what Ishant should do to break the partnerships on the batsmen's friendly pitch, Kapil said, "the bowler should bowl better, bowl consistently in better line and length
" yah aisa nahin ki aap ek over main do bahut acchhee gend phenk do, balki aapako paanch acchhee genden phenkani chahie
 Only then you can get more wickets
 ’’ (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 Zardari organized a dinner in Islamabad on the occasion of Diwali in honor of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 unhone kaha, 'ham kshetra main sthaayee shanti ke liye sabhi vivaadon kaa shantipurna samaadhaan chaahate hai
 After receiving information about the meeting with Nitish on the day of Diwali, the President decided to hold a dinner
 pehle se tay kaarykram ke mutabik nitish or unke pratinidhimandal ko shaam main raashtrapati bhawan main jaradaari se milanaa tha jiske baad videsh mantralay main unke liye raatri bhoj kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has come here on a week-long visit since Friday
 bayanon ke jariye raajnneeti main bane rahanaashaayad sabase sasta, tikaoo or majboot tarika he
 Apart from mainstream politics, rhetoric is perhaps the most effective weapon for leaders of religious organizations to remain in the limelight
 sadhvi praachi kii apiubasadhvi prachika letest bayaan suniye
 Sadhvi has appealed to Hindus neither to see films of Aamir, Salman and Shahrukh Khan nor to put their pictures in their homes
 ve lav jihad ke liye jimmedaar hai
 Sadhvi says, “our children do not get proper values from these three Khan films
 teenon khaanon kii tasviren utarkar holi jala do
 'earlier Sadhvi Prachi had said,' These people who produce 35-40 puppies, then spread love jihad
 us par koi baat nahin karata he
 But there was so much chaos after my statement
 logon ne mujhase kaha ki zyada bachche paidaa karne se vikaas ruk jayega par main apane bayaan par kaayam rahi
 Like Sakshi Maharaj's advice, Sakshi Maharaj had said, "if the country is to be saved, every Hindu must produce at least four children
 'yogi adityanath ke tikhe bayaan'ghar vaapasi' or 'lav jihad' ko lekar bijepi saansad yogi adityanath ke bayanon par bhi khub vivaad hota aayaa he
 Obama went on to say that US President Barack Obama, who came as chief guest on Republic Day, said that India will be successful as long as it is not divided on religious grounds and people will continue to watch movies of actors like Shahrukh and applause, apart from their faith
 
 haal hi main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne saaf taur par aagaah kiya ki kisi bhi dharmik samooh ko chaahe vah bahusankhyak hon yaa alpsankhyak, sarkaar ye ijaajat nahin degi ki khulkar yaa chhipakar duusare dharm ke prati ghrinaa failaaen
 During the Ayodhya movement in the 90s, there was a long list of Hinduist leaders whose statements remained in the headlines for a long time
 chaahe wo ashok singhl, praveen togadiya, vinay katiyaar or sadhvi ritambhra jinaki bhi baat karen sabhi ke bayaan takreeban ek jaise hote the
 In later days, the voices of some leaders slowed down but Togadia stayed in the field
 togadiya ke taaja bayaan par jaraa gaur farmaaie
 He says that if there is no law on forced conversions in the country, then the day is not far when the Hindu population in Assam, Kerala and West Bengal will be completely destroyed
 aisa lagata he hinduvadi netaaon kii nai peedi bayanon ke boote hi khud ko sthapit karne kii koshish main he
 It is difficult to say how much of the Hindu population will be misled by these statements in this period
 sirf baton kii kheti se kisi tikaoo utpaada kii ummid karnaa samajhadaari ke daayre main to nahin aa saktaa
 If these leaders did not do anything concrete, then the day is not far when their statements will start being neutralized as if the political fatwas are happening now
 uttar pradesh kii chunavi raajnneeti main gadhe ke baad sand ne entry maari he
 During the Lok Sabha election campaign, a bull was created by a bull at the Kannauj rally of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav
 samaajawaadee party ke adhyaksh akhilesh ne bhari sabha main sand kii entry par soobe ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath par aawaara pashuon kaa hawala dekar jamkar tanj ksaa
 Yogi Adityanath has now also replied on the strings of Akhilesh
 chunaav prachaar ke liye shahjahanpur pahunche siem yogi ne kaha, 'kannauj kii gathbandhan kii raily main ghus aae nandi baba ko jab yah pataa chalaa ki raily kasaayiyon kaa samarthan karne waalon kii ho rahi he to unhone raudra rup dikhaaya, nandi baba ko hataane ke saare jatan kiye gaye, lekin koi safal nahin hua
 When this prayer was made to him, brother let this SP also work, then he calmly left from there
 'bataa den ki 2 din pehle akhilesh kii jansabha main sand ghusaa tha
 During this time there was a stampede at the rally site
 sand par kaabo paane ke chakkar main kai surakshakarmi ghayal bhi ho gaye the
 On entering the meeting, Akhilesh Yadav took a pinch of CM Yogi
 dimple-akhilesh ke road sho main bhi ghusaa sandrode sho or reliyon main sand kaa aatank khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa
 On April 25, after a ruckus in Akhilesh Yadav's public meeting, a bull entered his road show on Saturday
 uske hamale se sapa ke kai kaaryakarta chotil ho gaye
 After this incident, Akhilesh taunted the state government by tweeting
 akhilesh yadav ne road sho main ghuse sand kaa video twitor par aplod kiya gaya or us par likhaa he, ye sand pashuon or kisaanon kii ore se gyaapan liye gum rahaa

 When told that this is not a rally for those who make him homeless, then he went quiet
 sapa adhyaksh ne kaha ki in logon ne jaanwaron ko bhi dukh pahunchaaya he
 We took votes from you in the name of animals
 unhone aage kaha ki 21 maheenon main hamane expresve banaaya tha lekin pichley do saalon main janata paanch karod aawaara pashuon se pareshaan ho gai he
 Akhilesh said that if the government is not able to stop the bull from entering political programs, then what will happen to the poor farmers, they will only know

 a post shared by Sania Mirza (@mirzasaniar) on Feb 3, 2019 at 5:50 am PST pashchim bengal main junior doctor ke saath hui marpet kaa maamla abhi thanda nahin padaa tha kii ol india institute of medical science (ames) sthit trama main doctor ke saath marij ke parijanon dwaara badasluki kaa maamla saamne aayaa
 According to Dr
 Amarinder Singh Malhi, head of the Resident Doctors Association (RDA), the whole case was like this, "late Sunday night, a patient brought his family to the trauma center
 lekin us vakt sambandhit doctor ke paas us marij se zyada gambhir marij ilaaj ke liye maujuud tha
 In such a situation, any doctor has to decide whether to see a more serious patient first
 lekin aisa sunate hi marij ke parijanon ne gaali-galouj shuru kar di
 "the case of West Bengal came to the limelight when the two junior doctors concerned were so beaten up that they lost their lives, while cases like abuses and misbehavior are routine
" dar ke maahaul main kya koi doctor kaam kar paaegaa?'' kuch yahi sawaal dilli medical association ke padaadhikari girish tyaagi bhi poochhate hai
 "would any doctor want to kill a patient?" But what happens is that many times the patient reaches such a position that it is not possible to save him
 aise main parijan bhadak jate hai or doctor par puraa aarope madh dete hai
 "they say that the government should take responsibility for the safety of doctors
" tabhi doctor bhi free hokar apana ferj nibhaa paaenge
 On asking Doctor Tyagi whether there is no law which provides for punishment of the guilty for such misbehavior with the doctors? At the state level, he says, the Medicare Service Personal and Medicine Service Institutions (prevention of Violence and Damages to Property) Act-2000
 haalanki yah desh main keval 19 rajyon main hi he
 But it is also unable to be used
 kai baar doctor khud kii chhavi kharaab hone ke dar se police ke paas nahin jate
 Even if some go, the police insists on getting the accused resolved instead of taking action
 is kanoon kii maujuudagi main kisi central kanoon kii kya jarurat he? indian medical association ke adhyaj doctor rajan sharma kehete hai, '' darasal 19 rajyon main yah kanoon to he
 But the problem is that in this IPPC and CRPC there is no section according to this law
 jab bhi koi doctor police ke paas apane upar hui hinsa ke maamle ko darj karaane jaataa he to yah saamaanya aparaadh kii dhara main hi darj ho jaati he
 Any incident such as assault or property damage
 jabaki is act ke mutabik yah cognijiable or non belabel offence he
 '' Dr
 sharma kehete hai ki yah virodhabhash is act ko kamjor karata he
 In such a situation, a central level law is needed
 jo doctors ke saath hui hinsa ke liye alag se kanoonee dhaaraon kaa praavdhaan kare
 There is no appeal to make law at the central level
 In fact, in 2016, an interministerial committee was formed in connection with the violence on doctors
 is cameti ne do saal pehle apni report saunpi jisamen kaha gaya he ki kendriya str par ek kanoon kii jarurat he jo doctors ko suraksha pradaan kar sake
 The atmosphere of fear among doctors is increasing
 lekin tab se yah report dhul kha rahi he
 The Bengal incident has acted as a trigger

 India has also informed Pakistan about Dawood's address and passport

 punjab vidhansabha main somvaar ko navjot singh siddhu ke front ko tagada jhatka laga
 The three mlas, Bans Brothers and Pargat Singh, belonging to awaaz-e-punjab, shouted slogans near Speaker Well to bring a resolution on the issue of giving water to Rajasthan and not taking water royalties
 vahiin navjot singh siddhu kii patni or navjot cor akalidal -bijepi vidhayakon ke saath baithi dikhaai di
 He kept away from the performance of the three mlas associated with awaaz-e-punjab
 pargat singh ne spikar ko saunpa akali dal se istifiske pehle aawaaj-e-punjab se jude vidhayak pargat singh ne vidhansabha spikar ko akali dal kii membership se istipha saunp diya
 The Akali dal-bjp mlas took a jibe asking Navjot Kaur to stand with the three opposing mlas
 unke manaa karne par aawaaj-e-punjab ke vidhayakon ne tanj kiya ki navjot cor abhi bhi bijepi ke saath hi hai
 When a political party is seen, he will resign
 When asked about this, he said that he is not a part of awaaz-e-punjab
 sahi vakt aane par hi wo bijepi se istipha dengi
 She said that her husband's decision to make awaaz-e-punjab is her and she does not know anything about it yet
 cor ne ek or hairaan karne vaali kahi ki wo istipha to tab den jab unhen aage koi political party najar aae
 He said that whether or not to go to awaaz-e-punjab would be his own personal decision
 aawaaj-e-punjab se jude teenon vidhayakon pargat singh or bains bros se jab is bare main sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha ki unki party puri tarah ek he
 She can tell about Navjot Kaur's sitting with the akali-bjp in the assembly
 siem ne navjot cor ke rukh kaa swaagat kiyaavahin akali dal or bijepi konvajot kaurake vidhansabha main aawaaj-e-punjab se jude vidhayakon ke saath khadey na hone se ek baar phir ye kehane kaa mauka mil gaya ki siddhu or unki patni abhi bhi bijepi main hi he
 Kaur is not ready to give up government posts and facilities at the moment
 siem prakaash singh badal ne kaha ki ham navjot cor ke is kadam kaa swaagat karte hai
 Sidhu does not give a couple when he leaves BJP Clear answer Nawazjot Singh Sidhu has also been asked many times to make it clear whether he is still in BJP or not, but Sidhu says go and ask this question to BJP
 0 navjot cor bhi bijepi se istife or unhen punjab sarkaar se mili mukhya sansadeey sachiv ke pad ko chhodane ke sawaal par koi sidhaa jawaab nahin de rahi
 Pargat Singh, who was the founder of the Siddhu couple's question on the voice-a-punjab and expelled from the Shiromani Akali Dal, submitted his resignation to the assembly speaker as a member of the Shiromani Akali Dal
 aawaaj-e-punjab ke vidhayakon bains bros ke saath khadey dikhaai die
 The detachment of the Sidhu couple and Navjot Kaur's new stand in the assembly raise many questions about the future of awaaz-e-punjab
 amritsar train haadase par punjab kii captain amarinder sarkaar ne jaanch ke aadesh to de die hai, lekin sawaalon ke ghere main amarinder cabinet ke mantri navjot singh siddhu or unki patninavjot kaurahain
 Because when the incident happened, Navjot Kaur was present on the stage of Ravana Dahan program and the place where the function was held falls in the assembly constituency of Navjot Singh Sidhu
 is maamle par railway jo bayaan de rahaa he, usase sthaneey netritv or kaarykram ke aayojakon par gambhir sawaal khadey rahe hai
 Although Navjot Singh Sidhu and his wife are questioning the railways, the DRM of Firozabad has dismissed such allegations outright
 yahaan tak ki rail rajya mantri ne bhi railway ko puri tarah se clin chit de di he
 In such a situation, many questions are being raised on Navjot Kaur Sidhu
 1
 Why did the event take place? The place where Ravana Dahan was organized is near gate number 27 between Amritsar and Manavala
 railway crossing se ghatnasthal kii duuri kareeb 300 meter he
 While the effigy was about 70 meters between the combustion site and the railway track
 baavjood iske yahaan putala dahan kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 The event was organized on behalf of the Youth Congress leader Saurabh, who is considered close to Navjot Kaur
 aise main sawaal ye ki navjot cor ne is kaarykram ko yojit hi kyon hone diya?2
 Why did not take permission for the event? Local administration says that permission was not taken to organize the event
 agar aisa he to phir punjab sarkaar main mantri navjot singh siddhu kii patni navjot cor us kaarykram main hi kyon pahunchin or unhone aayojak se isaki parmishan lene ke liye kyon nahin kaha
 3
 suraksha sunishchit kyon nahin kii gai?navjot cor ek aise kaarykram main shirkat karne pahunchin thim, jo samvedansheel jagah yojit kiya gaya tha
 Also, when the administration did not allow it, why did Navjot Kaur not demand from the administration for adequate security there? 4
 railway se koi baatcheet kyon nahin huinvajot cor ke pati navjot singh siddhu amritsar seat se saansad bhi rahe hai
 He was elected MLA from the same region in the 2017 assembly elections
 unki patni navjot cor bhi saarvajanik jivan main kaaphi sakriy rahati hai
 In such a situation, why did Navjot Kaur not talk to Ray Lavey before reaching a crowded event at such a murderous place and there was no demand to reduce the speed of the train or to deploy GRP personnel? 5
 logon ko aagaah kyon nahin kiya?bataaya ja rahaa he ki ilaake main ravan dahan ke kai kaarykram yojit hue the or navjot cor yahaan sabase aakhir main pahunchin thim
 When she went there, around 5 thousand people had gathered
 aise main manch se kareeb 70 meter dur guzar rahi rail patari par khadey logon ko dekhakar bhi navjot ne unhen vahaan se hatane ke liye kyon nahin kaha
 While the person giving the address from the stage was telling that so many thousands of people have come to welcome you, Madam
 6
 Why did not help after the accident? Eyewitnesses are alleging that Navjot Kaur left her car in the car when the train crushed people
 aarope he ki navjot ne kisi hataahat ko madad pahunchane tak kii jahamat nahin uthaai
 However, after that she reached the hospital in the night and she dismissed all the allegations like running away from the scene
 bataa den shuukravaar shaam ye haadasa amritsar or manawala ke bich phatak number 27 ke paas hua
 Around 7 pm, people were present on the railway track at Joda Gate
 patariyon se mahaj 200 feet kii duuri par putala jalaayaa ja rahaa tha
 So far 60 people have died in this accident
 jabaki 51 log gambhir rup se jakhmi hai, jinka aspataal main ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Surprisingly, Ravana has been burning like this here for years
 yani saalon se haadase kaa intjaar kiya ja rahaa tha
 The local administration either ignored the danger or did not understand such a small thing about how dangerous it was to conduct the Ravana combustion program
 ab railway, sthaneey prashasan, saansad-sarkaar, sab ek-duusare par topi transfar kar rahe hai

 priyanka gandhi kii sakriy raajnneeti main entry ke baad siyasat dhuree main ek baar phir se congress party aa gai he
 It is being said that just before the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress has run its trump card in the form of Priyanka Gandhi and its big political bets

 com / wiqprqza5a— Jackky Bhagnani (@jackkybhagnani)september 10, 2015 Roadshow of Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Jyotiraditya Scindia, general secretary in charge of western Uttar Pradesh, continues in Lucknow
 is bich road sho ke dauraan rahul gandhi ne lalbaag chauraahey par kaaryakartaaon ke hujum ko sambodhit kiya
 Raising the Rafale issue, Rahul Gandhi shouted slogans of 'chowkidar Chor Hai' and said that we will not sit peacefully until the Congress government is formed in UP
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne rafel ladaaku vimaan saude kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne saamanantar baatcheet kii
 During this, he shouted slogans of 'chowkidar Chor Hai' from the workers
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ab ham front foot par khelenge or jab tak congress kii sarkaar upi main nahin banati chaiyn se nahin baithenge
 Rahul said that UP is the heart of India, i have made Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia as general secretaries
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav 2019 mahatvapurn he, lekin unka lakshya (priyanka or sindhiya) congress kii vichaardhaara ko failaana or upi main sarkaar bananaa he
 It is worth mentioning that after taking charge as the General Secretary, a road show was organized from Chaudhary Charan Singh Airport in Lucknow to Congress headquarters on the arrival of Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia for the first time
 is maukey par rahul gandhi swayan apane donon mahasachivon ke saath lakhanu pahunche
 Rahul, who was a constant attacker on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Rafale issue, also waved Rafale's placard at the roadshow
 jaahir he congress adhyaksh rafel saude ko jan-jan kaa mudda bananaa chaahate hai
 Because political analysts were saying that the Rafale issue was not touching the public
 rahul gandhi ne lakhanu ke mashhoor hajratganj chauraahey par bhi kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kiya or babasaheb ambedkar or purv pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri kii pratimaa par maalyarpan kiya
 Explain that in view of the Lok Sabha elections 2019, the Congress President has appointed two in-charge general secretaries in UP
 jisamen purvi uttar pradesh kii jimmedaari priyanka gandhi ko di gai he to vahiin pashchimi upi kaa prabhaar jyotiraditya sindhiya ko saunpa gaya he
 From the administrative point of view, the Congress Party has divided 18 divisions of UP into 9 each of Eastern and Western Uttar Pradesh
 is lihaaj se priyanka gandhi ke jimme loksabhaa kii 42 or jyotiraditya ko 38 siton kii jimmedaari di gai he
 The challenge for Priyanka Gandhi in eastern Uttar Pradesh is huge because Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency Varanasi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's stronghold Gorakhpur comes under this area
 1989 se lagaataar pradesh main haar se congress cader hataash or sust the
 From time to time, there was a demand from the Congress high command to bring Priyanka into politics
 ab priyanka kii siyasat main aupchaarik entry se kam se kam congress kaaryakarta utsahit hua he
 After inaugurating the ambitious project Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a rally that if the countrymen decide anything, then no challenge remains for them

 He said that this dam project will change the fate of crores of farmers of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra
 piem modi ne kaha ki narmada kaa pani paras he, jis prakaar paras lohe ko sparsh kar sona bana detaa he, usee prakaar is baandh kaa pani jis sukhi jameen par jayega, vah jameen sona ugalane lagegi
 Also read: The foundation stone in 1961, inaugurated in 2017, the journey of Sardar Sarovar Dam was very volatile is pariyojna main hui deree ke bare main pradhanmantri ne kaha ki vah ise raajnneeti se nahin jod rahe hai, varanaa unke paas un sabhi logon kaa kaccha chittha he, jinhone is pariyojna main baadhaaen utpann kii, aarope lagaae or sajeesh rachi
 The Prime Minister also said that whenever the governments honoring the Narmada River came, then the work of this project gained a lot of speed and the work of this project did not increase rapidly for the rest of the time
 unhone kaha ki jis world bank bank ne gujarat ko narmada baandh ke liye dhan dene se inkaar kiya tha, usee vishwa bank ne 2001 main gujarat ke kuccha main hue har ek kaaryon ke liye rajya ko green aword se puraskrit kiya
 Also read: Important information related to Sardar Sarovar Dam piem modi ne kaha ki is pariyojna ke liye vah do logon ke abhaari hai- sardaar vallabh bhai patel or baba sahib ambedkar
 He said, 'wherever the soul of the Iron Man of India is today, he will be showering a lot of blessings on us
 ' unhone kaha ki sardaar patel ne ek divya drushti kii tarah is gujarat kshetra main sinchai or jal sankat ko dekhte hue narmada par baandh kii pariklpana kii thi
 PM Modi said that Baba Saheb Ambedkar had envisaged all the schemes for the development of the country while in the Council of Ministers
 unhone kaha ki agar ye donon mahapurush adhik samay tak jivit rahete to desh ko unki pratibha kaa or bhi laabh miltaa
 PM Modi said that India has two arms
 pashchimi or purvi bharat
 Just as the Narmada Dam will go a long way in solving the problem of irrigation and drinking water of Western India, he wants to make efforts on a large scale to solve the power problem of Eastern India
 yah bhi padhein : 1961 main shilanyas, 2017 main hua udghaatan, kitna utaar-chadhaav bharaa rahaa sardaar sarovar baandh kaa safar Regarding the delay in the project, the Prime Minister said that he is not linking it to politics, otherwise he has a raw letter from all those who created obstacles, accused and conspired in the project
