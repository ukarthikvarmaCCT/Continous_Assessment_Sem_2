 The first poster of well-known director Imtiaz Ali's popular film 'highway' was released on Monday and the first official trailer was launched shortly thereafter
 film ke do poster relies kiye gaye
 The film will feature Mahesh Bhatt's daughter Alia Bhatt with Randeep Hooda, Bhatt Camp's favorite
 sajid nadianwala or utivi motions pikchars is film ke nirmaataa hai
 The film 'highway' will be released on February 21, 2014
 film main auskar aword vijeta eaar rahamaan ne sangeet diya he
 Let me tell you that this film is Alia Bhatt's second film
 isse pehle vah karan johar kii film 'student of da year' main najar ai thim
 However, Alia and Randeep have not revealed much about this film
 lekin is film main aalia 'student of da year' se kaaphi hatakar lag rahi hai
 The promo of the film clears up the situation to some extent
 dikh rahaa he imtiyaaj apni filmon main mahila kairactor ko jis tarah ahmiyat dete rahe hai, isamen bhi vaisaa hi najar aa rahaa he
 Imtiaz Ali, who made his film directorial debut in 2005 with 'socha Na Tha', gives a lot of importance to the journey in his films
 film rockstar main bhi unhone is baat ko kaaphi tavajjo di thi
 Now this thing is visible in the highway too
 film Highway kaa trailor- The beginning of the election year of the eight states, which are being called the semi-finals before the general elections next year, did not bode well for the BJP
 haal main hue teen loksabhaa or do vidhansabha upachunaavon ne bhagava party ko niraash hi kiya
 He got the most shock in two Lok Sabha and one assembly seat of Rajasthan, from which he will need to do a lot to overcome
 uske liye sukun kii baat yah he ki pashchim bengal main uluberia sansadeey or noapada vidhansabha upachunaav main vah makapa or congress ko peeche dhakelkar duusare sthaan par pahunch gai
 However, the victory of the Trinamool Congress over these two is so heavy that the BJP cannot be in a position to celebrate even if they want to
 uluberia main trinmul kii jeet kaa antar 4
 74 lakhs and 63,000 in Noapada
 jashn manaane kaa mauka to yakeenan congress ke haath laga he
 He won the Lok Sabha seats of Ajmer and Alwar and the Assembly seats of Mandalgarh and won all the three seats in the by-elections in Rajasthan
 congress ke teenon ummidavaaron raghu sharma, karan singh yadav or vivek dhakad ne kul saat lakh se zyada vot paakar jeet hasil kii
 In the last election, these three seats were in bjp's account
 lekin is baar in 17 vidhansabha kshetron main ek main bhi bhaajapa badhat nahin darj kar pai
 With this, if Congress leaders start dreaming of a return to the state, then they have a right to it
 in nateezon ne bataur pradesh congress adhyaksh sachin payalat kii kursi pakki kar di he or ab agle vidhansabha chunaavon main ve hi party kii aguai karenge
 Former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot will continue to play the role of advisor, as the party also needs his experience
 udhar, mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ko apni kaaryastylee main jabardast badlaav laana hoga
 At the same time, they will also have to undergo heavy reshuffle in the cabinet and some veteran ministers have to be removed and sent to do the ground work
 haalanki pradesh bhaajapa is haar kaa thikra notebandi, jiesti or aresas kaa sahyog na milane par phod rahi he, par aise bahaane vidhansabha chunaav main party kaa pradarshan sudhaarney main koi madad nahin karenge
 By the way, it is certain that Raje should be active again as she was during the last three years
 unhen party kaaryakartaaon or aam logon se mail-mulaakaat or baat kerani chahie or pakkaa karnaa chahie ki unke farmaanon par amal ho
 Whatever the reason, they have lost their image of a skilled administrator
 nateezon ke baad ek bade afasar ne kaha, ''afasarshahi ke ek dhade ne unhen kaamkaaj ko lekar aise sabjbag dikhaae jinhen kabhi puraa nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The other faction is immersed in itself and is so un-political that it does not understand the implications and consequences of their decisions
 ''udhar, chunaav jeetne ke fouran baad pradesh congress adhyaksh sachin payalat ne india today se kaha, ''mujhe tajjub nahin hua
 Even after the Lok Sabha elections, we had won three of the four assembly seats
 '' yah isliye bhi badi baat he kyonki payalat ne takreeban matiamet party kii kaman sanbhali thi
 In the last four years, he has brought the party afresh with small steps
 shaayad hi kabhi kisi congress netaa ne khud ko sthapit karne ke liye itani kadi mehnat kii hogi
 Caste equations also worked for the pilot
 yadavon ke dabadabe vaali seat par diggaj netaa karan singh yadav ko utaarne kaa payalat kaa faisla kargar rahaa
 Apart from this, the Congress also got the support of the Meo Muslims, who have been targeted by the bjp's cow protection brigade in this area
 ajmer main bhi bhaajapa ke brahman vot kaatane ke liye raghu sharma ko khadaa karne kaa payalat kaa faisla kaamyaab rahaa
 Gehlot worked hard for his colleague Sharma
 khud congress ke liye bhi sabase zyada hairaani kii baat mandalgarh kii jeet he
 Although this seat has been the traditional stronghold of the Congress, it was deemed a loser after a rebel leader of the party came into the fray
 payalat ne sarkaar kii khaamiyon par lagaataar chot kii or kisaanon kii khudakshi, jan-suvidhaon kii buree haalat or dharmik ashishnutaa sareekhe muddon ko ubhaara
 They also succeeded
 gahalot ne party kaaryakartaaon ko yaad dilaayaa ki agar party gujarat main itnaa acha pradarshan kar sakati he, to rajasthan main bhi kar sakati he
 At the same time, no dice of BJP was found favorable this time
 *** a case of distribution of books containing objectionable material has come to light against Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh's Badaun district
 congress party kii taraf se iske khilaaf shikaayat darj kara di gai he
 Congress district president Omkar Singh said, 'we received books from two children near Nagalamandir village, in which objectionable things about Rahul have been written
 kitaab main unhen dushkarm kaa aaropee bataane ke saath kaala dhan videshon main jamaa karne kaa bhi aaropee bataaya gaya he
 'he told,' The book has published objectionable things about Rahul as well as other members of the Gandhi family

 At the same time, another bike rider said that nothing will happen with 5 rupees

 Defending champions Pakistan, recovering from Malinga's shaking, scored a respectable score of 260 for five from the first ODI century of Fawad Alam (114 not out), but Alam's hundred did not work for the team

 thirimane ne 101 ran banaae, jo unka teesraa vanade shatak he
 In this, he faced 108 balls and scored 13 fours
 unhen bhi ajmal ne hi apane doosraa se bold kiya
 However the Sri Lankan team was then only 14 runs away from victory
 jayavardhane ne toornament main srilanka ke liye pehla upyogi yogadan diya or iske liye isse behatar samay nahin ho saktaa tha
 He was on 52 when Mohammad Hafeez dropped his catch off Umar Gul

 He then returned in the 27th over, but it was too late by then as Thirimanne had scored 64 off 63 balls and Jayawardene was also playing for 40 off 55 balls with four fours and a six
 yaheen se pakistani team ne match ganvaa diya, iske baad kuch bhi unke haq main nahin rahaa
 He missed several catches while fielding foul
 isse pehle toss jitkar ballebaaji karne utari pakistani team 18 ran par teen wicket khokar jujh rahi thi kyonki 'main aaf da match' malinga (56 ran dekar paanch wicket) ne sheersh kram ko tahas nahas kar diya tha lekin alam ne captain misbah ul haq or umr akmal ke saath kramash: do shatkeey saajhedaariyaan nibhaakar team ko yah score banane main madad kii

 Malinga, however, saw the aggressive wicket of Sharjeel, who caught Perera at mid-on in an attempt to score a third boundary

 To tell the public how much work has been done by the government, it is once again ready to resort to the report card
 is report card main sarkaar ke kaam kaa bakhaan hoga
 Now it has to be seen how much the public believes on the claims being made in this card
 mukhyamantri shila dikshit apane 15 saal main kiye gaye kaam kaa dhol peetane is report card ko lekar aane vaali hai
 This report has been prepared in two parts
 pehla hissaa dilli ke vikaas ko dikhayega to doosraa dilli main hone vaale saamaajik badlaav ko
 Through this report, Sheela is not only trying to woo the public but she is the only face of the Congress in Delhi, it has also been taken care of
 shila kii report card kaa naaraa he, 'dilli kii gaatha bemisaal, nirantar vikaas 15 saal' is report card main shiksha, paryaavaran, samskruti or logon ke jivan str sudhaarney kii tamaam tasveeron ko ukerne kii koshish kii gai he
 Along with this, there was a lot of talk of the government's work in economic prosperity, illegal colonies and resettlement colonies
 sarkaar ne apni ann shri yojana ke alaava khaadya suraksha kanoon ko bhi logon ke jivan main badlaav karne kaa saadhan bataaya he
 That is, overall, Sheila Dixit wants to enter the election field through this report card saying that the government is patting her back and all that is needed is that the voters put their hands on the government's head
 kya priyanka wadra, rahul gandhi kaa brahmastra hai, jinka nishaanaa keval bhartiya janata party(bhaajapa) he? yaa congress adhyaksh ke nishane par uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party (sapa)-bahujan samaaj party (basapa) gathbandhan bhi he? bhaajapa jaahir taur par congress kii mukhya virdohi he, lekin bharat kii raajnneeti ko bamushkil hi shwet-shyaam main varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 There is also some ambiguous situation here, which blurs the base of friends and enemies
 is baat ke bhi thode sanket hai ki sapa or basapa ne aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav ke liye rajyastar par chota gathbandhan kar 134 varsh puraani party ko 80 main se keval do siten di, jisase bhi congress naaraaz he
 The shock of exclusion from the alliance was made comfortable with a few lenient words, and in response, sp's Akhilesh Yadav also showed a sense of 'respect' for Rahul Gandhi
 lekin basapa kii mayawati kathor bani raheen
 He had earlier abruptly ended seat-sharing talks with Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 uttar pradesh main apmaan se aahat, congress ne rajya kii sabhi 80 siton par ladane kii patibaddhta jataai
 Priyanka Vadra's appointment as party general secretary for eastern Uttar Pradesh may be linked to the party's extra effort in which the Congress will try to make its presence felt in a state where it has not been able to make its presence known for over a decade
 iske alaava pashchimi uttar pradesh kaa prabharee mahasachit jyodiraditya sindhiya ko banaaya gaya he
 SP and BSP will not be very happy with the revival of Congress
 is baat ke bhi thode sanket hai ki parivaar ke karishmai chehre ko maidan main laane se party main utsaah kaa nayaa sanchaar hoga, jiskaa kaaryakarta lambey samay se intjaar kar rahe the
 Will this stir work at the grassroots level, where the SP-BSP alliance has kept 75 seats with itself? Of these, 37 seats have been left for the SP, 38 with the BSP and three with the Rashtriya Lok Dal and two for the Congress
 is samay, sapa, basapa or ralod ye ummid kar rahe hai ki unke paas pichhadi jati, jatvon or jaaton kaa abhedya samarthan he
 Now they must be hoping that the revived Congress will snatch the upper caste caste votes from the BJP, which will ensure secular parties win with caste equations
 lekin yah bhi sambhav he ki sapa-basapa-ralod, congress or bhaajapa ke bich maton kaa bantwaaraa ho jayega
 This may benefit the BJP if a Muslim vote is divided between the SP-BSP-RLD and the Congress
 iske alaava, rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki congress baikfoot par nahin khelegi, jisaki party ke nirnay main spasht jhalak dikh rahi he
 The party has not tied up with the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) in Andhra Pradesh and the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, which means that in some states it will not be possible to field a 'secular' candidate against the BJP in each of the seats
 jiske falswaroop rashtriya str par mahagathbandhan kii baton ke kamjor prabhaav kaa akalan karnaa aasaan he
 In this sense, Priyanka Gandhi's entry into politics can have a destabilizing effect, which may not always be beneficial for the Congress in terms of adding friends and influencing people
 mana ja rahaa he ki vah apane baatcheet ke kaushal or bheed ke saath ek jeevant or sahanubhutipurna samvaad kaushal se congress main ek raajnneetik urja kaa pravaah karegi, jisase pradhanmantri banane kaa unke bhai kaa daawa or majboot ho saktaa he

 Also, another spokesperson spoke of the 'relationship' that the people of India have with the nehru-gandhi family
 bhaajapa narendra modi kii vakpatutaa par nirbhar he, lekin is kshetra main priyanka wadra ke hamalon se bhaajapa ko saavdhaan rahanaa hoga
 Because she can present such a challenge, which the BJP has not faced in the last four and a half years
 bhaajapa ko iske alaava bheed ko aakarshith karne kii priyanka wadra kii kala ko bhi saavdhaanee se dekhnaa hoga ki kya vah nehru va indira gandhi ke karishme ko doharaa sakati hai

 rohit form main na hone ke baavjood newjiland siries ke liye bharat kii test team main apana sthaan barkaraar rakhane main safal rahe hai lekin vah pehle test ke liye antim ekadash main daawa pesh karne main asafal rahe
 On the flat pitch, his Mumbai teammates Pawar (100 off 228 balls), Yadav (103 off 86 balls), Siddhesh Lad (86 not out off 62 balls) and Armaan Jaffer (69 off 123 balls) performed well
 mumbai ne ek wicket par 29 ran se aage khelnaa shuru kiya or duusare din stump tak usne paanch wicket ganvaakar 431 ran bana liye
 New Zealand declared the innings on 324 for seven on opening day yesterday
 aaj mumbai kii team ne 90 over main 4
 a total of 402 runs were scored at a run rate of 46
 mehmaan team ke liye aaj kaa din kaaphi kathin rahaa, unke gendbaajon ne dhoop main mehnat bhi kii or unhen zyada safalataa bhi nahin mili
 The fast bowlers were also not expecting much on a flat pitch, but New Zealand spin trio Sodhi (2 for 132), Mitchell Santner (1 for 71) and Mark Craig (no 60) Nothing special happened
 test siries ko dekhte hue bharat ke liye ekmaatr niraashaa rohit kaa out hona rahi, jo form hasil karne ke liye dalip trophy ke final main bhi khele the
 Rohit Jaffer's wicket came to the crease after the fall, he took 10 balls to get the first run but he started with style and sent a six off the leg off the leg-spinner Sodhi
 haalanki yah unki 18 ran kii sankshipt pari kaa ekmaatr acha shot rahaa or vah sodhi ko hit karne ke prayaas main stump out hue
 After this Yadav went to support Pawar at the crease
 yadav ne jeevandaan milane kaa puraa phayda uthaaya
 He did not mind the pace bowling of fast bowlers Trent Boult and Neil Wagner or three spinners
 yadav ke dabadabe kaa andaja is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki unhone apana ardhashatak or shatak chakka lagaakar puraa kiya
 He hit eight sixes in his innings, most of them at mid-wicket and his innings included nine fours
 tippaniyan Pawar too remained at his end, both of whom contributed 155 runs for the fourth wicket
 pavaar shatak banane ke baad ritair out hue
 Lad landed at the crease who also enjoyed batting with Aditya Tare (53 not out)
 din kaa khel samaapt hone tak gendbaajon ke thakne se kotla par chhakkon or chaukon kii barsaat ho rahi thi
 (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it has been published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) Despite Rohit not being in form, New Zealand have managed to retain their place in India's Test squad for the series but failed to stake claim in the playing XI for the first Test
 sapaat pich par unke mumbai ke saathiyon pavaar (228 gend main 100 ran), yadav (86 gend main 103 ran), siddhesh laad (62 gend main naabad 86 ran) or armaan jafar (123 gend main 69 ran) ne acha pradarshan kiya
 Mumbai started to play by 29 runs for one wicket and by the stumps on the second day, they scored 431 losing five wickets
 newjiland ne kal shuruaati din saat wicket par 324 ran par pari ghoshit kii thi
 Today, Mumbai team scored 4 in 90 overs
 46 kii ran gati se kul 402 ran jutaaye
 Today was a tough day for the visiting team, their bowlers worked hard in the sun and did not get much success
 tej gendbaajon se bhi sapaat pich par zyada ummid nahin kii ja rahi thi lekin newjiland kii spin tikdi sodhi (132 ran dekar do wicket), mishael santner (71 ran dekar ek wicket) or mark craig (60 ran dekar koi wicket nahin) kaa pradarshan bhi kuch khaas nahin rahaa
 Looking at the Test series, the only disappointment for India was the dismissal of Rohit, who also played in the final of the Duleep Trophy to regain form
 rohit jafar kaa wicket girane ke baad krij par utre, unhen pehla ran jutaney main 10 gend lagi lekin unhone style se shuruuaat kii or leg spinner sodhi kii gend par street hit karte hue chakke ke liye bheja
 However this was the only good shot of his brief 18-run knock and he was stumped in an attempt to hit Sodhi
 iske baad yadav krij par pavaar kaa saath dene utre
 Yadav took full advantage of getting a life donation
 unhen tej gendbaaj trent bolt or nil wagonar yaa teen spinneron kii gendbaaji se koi fark nahin padaa
 Yadav's dominance can be gauged from the fact that he completed his half-century and century by hitting sixes
 unhone apni pari main aath chakke lagaae jisamen se zyaadaatar mid wicket par lage or unki pari main nau chauke bhi shaamil the
 The comments pavaar bhi apane chor par date rahe, in donon ne chauthe wicket ke liye 155 ran kii bhagidaari nibhaai
 Pawar retired after scoring a century
 laad krij par utre jinhone bhi aditya taare (naabad 53 ran) ke saath ballebaaji kaa lutf uthaaya
 By the time the day's play was over, Kotla was raining sixes and fours due to the tired bowlers

 He joined the Amar Naik gang, seeking revenge for the murder of his smuggler father

 He had been living in Singapore for many years after escaping from the country
 vahaan dikhaave ke liye usne electronics kaarobaar jamaa rakhaa tha
 He used to do his black business under the guise of that
 varsh 1990 main mumbai se faraar hone se pehle pillai ko keval ek baar giraftaar kiya gaya tha or baad main vah jamaanat par chhot gaya tha
 (also input from agency language) vah desh se faraar hone ke baad kai saalon se singapore main rah rahaa tha
 He had set up the electronics business to show up there
 usee kii aad main vah apana kaala kaarobaar karata tha
 Pillai was arrested only once before escaping from Mumbai in 1990 and was later released on bail

 The special thing is that after the proceedings, the police are hiding their mouths on their exploits themselves

 Not only this, Yogendra Singh Yadav is also the only surviving Paramveer Chakra winner in India, but the Gulawathi police suspect that his three brothers, including Yogendra Singh, may disturb the peace in a land dispute
 aise main police ne siarpisi 107 / 7 kii kaarywahi kar muchalaka paband kar diya he
 Due to the notice, Yogendra Singh and his three brothers are to appear before the SDM on 22 August

 It is alleged that Yogendra Singh Yadav, Jitendra Yadav and Devendra Yadav's son Ratiram were forced to send a surety challan report to SDM court without investigation from Gulawathi police regarding the case

 AMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi and RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat both came to Lucknow but Samajwadi Party people showed black flags to Owaisi, not Bhagwat
 siyaasi halkon main yah charchaa kaa vishay he
 Owaisi wants to field his party All India Majlis Itehadul Muslemin in UP in the next assembly elections
 upi main 18 fisad se zyaada muslim vot he jiskaa bada hissaa pichley vidhaan sabha chunaav main samaajawaadee party ko mila tha
 Owaisi wants to share in the same Muslim vote bank of the Samajwadi Party
 zaahir he samaajawaadee party ise pasand nahin karegi
 Owaisi has tried to convene several times in the last two years in Azamgarh and Lucknow, but the administration does not allow them to address the issue of law and order
 ovaisi pichley dinon faizabad main us vaqt ek sabha kar paae jab unka ummidavaar vahaan se up-chunaav lard rahaa tha
 In his press conference in Lucknow on Monday, Owaisi said, "today, there is an RSS chief in Lucknow
 unki sabha hone ja rahi he, magar asaduddin ovaisi ko parmishan nahin diya jaataa, isse baat sabit ho gai kii koun aresas se mila hua he
 " ovaisi kisi pakke siyasatdan kii tarah muslmamanon ke har firaqe se judy hui jagahon par gaye
 First he visited the tomb of Sufi saint Haji Waris Ali Shah in Dewa, Barabanki, which is the site of worship of Sufi and Barelvi Muslims, then he went to Nadwatul Ulema which is the center of Wahhabi Islam, and then he met Maulana Kalbe Jawwad Gaya, who is a major religious guru of Shia Muslims
 tippaniyan Owaisi was more targeted by the Samajwadi Party
 dusre number par unka hamalaa bijepi par tha, lekin hameshaa kii tarah vah bispi ke khilaaf kuch nahin bole
 Rather he said that his party's slogan is "jai Meem and Jai Bhim"
 'mim' urdu kaa vah akshar he jisase "m" kii dhwani nikalati he
 Therefore Owaisi means "mim" means Muslim and "bhima" means Dalit
 ovaisi ne apni press conference main 5 baar "hindustaan zindaabad" or "jai hind" ke naare lagaae
 He said that he is a patriot
 hindustaan ke shahari hai
 Top class are urban, but they do not need certificate of patriotism from anyone
 " UP has more than 18 per cent Muslim vote, the bulk of which was won by Samajwadi Party in the last assembly elections
 ovaisi samaajawaadee party ke usee muslim vot bank main hissaa bantaana chaahate hai
 Of course, the Samajwadi Party will not like it
 ovaisi pichley do saal main kai baar azamgarh or lakhanu main sabha karne kii koshish kar chuke hai, lekin prashasan kaanoon vyavastha kaa masalaa bataa ke unhen isaki ijazat nahin detaa
 Owaisi was able to hold a meeting in Faizabad recently when his candidate was contesting the by-election from there
 lakhanu main somvaar ko apni press conference main ovaisi ne kaha, "aaj lakhanu main aresas ke chif hai

 Amidst all this, it became clear that Varun's strategy of using inflammatory language has shown an impact

 ramlila maidan main jantar-mantar se kareeb das guna bheed
 But not as enthusiastic as the Anna movement
 swatahsfoort yuvaaon kaa rukh ramlila maidan main nahin hone se sarkaar ke khilaaf andolan thanda padaa he
 People from every corner of the country have gathered in support of Swami Ramdev, but most people are either associated with Ramdev's Bharat Swabhimaan Trust or Patanjali Yogpeeth
 khud ramdev andolan ke duusare din manch se kehete hai, ''hamaare tevar deele nahin pade hai
 Our pace is the same, but yes, we have reduced our anger slightly

 The ombudsman has now come on the agenda of Baba, who triggered the movement on the issue of black money, and he says, "the Lokpal fight is not over yet
" hamen akad nahin dikhaani chahie

 ''ramdev kaa yah rukh anna ke vichaaron ke vipareet he
 But on differences with Anna, he says, "there is no fight between us
" '' lekin team anna ke andolan ko post kar chuki sarkaar ramdev ko bhi tavajjo dene ke mood main nahin he
 While Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid mocked the Ramlila movement that takes place every year, Congress spokesperson Renuka Chaudhary declares no talks outside Parliament
 haalanki bijepi ne bhrashtachar ke khilaaf baba ke andolan ko naitik samarthan jarur de diya he
 But the question arises that when the government did not bow down in front of Anna's movement full of enthusiasm, will Ramdev succeed with the help of followers? The government's seriousness is clear from its statements, but after three days Baba has announced to cry for revolution

 Even if you think that the monster named Ragging is dead in the school colleges of India, but you are completely wrong
 lekin is khabar se aapke rongte khadey ho jaaenge
 Sainik School Tilaiya, one of the most prestigious and well known school in the country
 jharkhand or aasapaas ke rajyon ke maa baap kaa sapana hota he ki unke bacchon ko sainik skool tilaiya main daakhila mil jaae taaki unka bhavishya ban jaae
 Sainik School in Koderma, Jharkhand is famous for its discipline and excellent education, but the same school is being openly flouted by the rules against discipline and wrangling of the Supreme Court
 skool ke senior chaatr raging to kar hi rahe hai or is dauraan junior chaatro ko belt or mukkon se peet bhi rahe hai
 This shocking incident has been imprisoned by a student of Sainik School on his mobile few days back
 skool main raging kaa ye alam he ki ek chaatr isse ghabaraakar skool chhod apni maa ke dhabas par bartan dhone ko majaboor he
 This student named Shambhu (name changed) is also a student of class VIII at Tilaiya Sainik School but due to the ragging of seniors, he had to come to his home from school to Ranchi
 shanbhu ke sharir par pade jakhm ke nishaan bhi sainik skool tilaiya main raging kii kaali hakeekat ko aapke saamne pesh kar rahe hai
 Shambhu's mother too has now decided that her red ragging gift will not go up anymore
 sainik skool tilaiya ke chaatr bhi camere par raging kii baat kabool kar rahe hai lekin skool prashasan hai ki raging kii baat se apane aap ko bilkul anjaan bataa rahaa he
 Is it possible that the bitter reality of the information inside and outside the school is not known to the top officials of the school itself
 supreme court ne bhale hi raging par pabandi laga di ho lekin sainik skool tilaiya kii in haivaaniyat bhari khabaron ke baad to yahi lagata he ki raging ke rakshas skool kolej har jagah abhi bhi jinda he or khuleam apni manamaani kar rahe hai
 The student of the eighth, who has returned to his home in Ranchi from Sainik School Tilaiya, is a living proof of the work of the demons of Shambhu ragging
 garibi kii vajah shanbhu raging kaa khulaasa karne kii himmat apane skool main nahin juta paaya lekin ab wo saaf-saaf ye kah rahaa he ki jis vakt senior chaatr junior chaatro ke saath marpet or raging karte hai us vakt hostel ke warden bhi vahaan maujuud hote hai
 Not only is the story of the ragging and assault that happened with Ranchi, but other junior students of Sainik School are also openly testifying on camera that yes, senior students in the school do their own arbitrariness
 lekin skool prashasan he ki sachai maanane ko taiyaar hi nahin he
 The school administration is arguing that they have not received any information and complaint about ragging yet, but the picture and news related to the world which is known to the school is unknown, it sounds ridiculous
 hairaani hoti he ki kaise desh ke ek jane maane sainik skool main raging ke rakshas abhi bhi khuleam apni karatuuton ko bekhauf anjaam de rahe hai
 Because of them, a promising has almost lost its future and how the future of other students is at stake

 Navjot Singh Sidhu's name is also being added to this list after the comedian Kapil Sharma's show got to know many of the team's artists

 Please tell that Sidhu has been running ill for the last several days

 The matter is that Sidhu was ill
 unhen tej bukhaar tha
 In such a situation, shooting stopped for Kapil's show Sunday
 iske saath hi unki kursi bhi suuni ho gai
 But Kapil did not wait for Sidhu to return and made Archana Puran Singh sit in his place
 kapil sharma ke sho kaa hoga mekaover, team se judaa ye filmi namayah baat siddhu ko nagavar gujri or unhone kapil ko phone kar latad diya
 Kapil tried to explain the whole thing to Sidhu, but he was not ready to listen to anything
 ab sho se siddhu out ho chuke hai or is baat kii jaankaree khud archana ne ek baatcheet ke dauraan kii
 The channel extended the contract with Kapil Sharma, will not be closed
 Shorancha Puran Singh said during an interview that the audience of the show is accustomed to seeing Sidhu ji in this chair
 siddhu ji kii kursi par baithna bahut ajeeb lagata he
 When Kapil Sharma called me on the day of the shooting, i could not refuse my old friend
 archana ne aage kaha ki main kapil ke sho main sirf kuch episod main hi najar aauungi, jaise hi siddhu ji ke tabiyat main sudhaar ho jaaenga, vah phir se apni kursi par kabiz ho jaaenge
 Let us tell you that Kapil and Archana's friendship is very old
 jab kapil kuch bhi nahin the or 'kamedi sarkas' main baaki kamedian kii tarah kamedi karte najar aate the tab se yah donon ek dusre ke dost hai
 Kapil Sharma again in dispute, now quarreled with Sidhu about the chair, that Navjot Singh Sidhu has adjusted the time for Kapil's show many times, even when he did not have a stay in Mumbai
 unhone do se teen din pehle bhi sho kii shooting kii he, taaki samay par isaki editing kii ja sake
 In such a situation, Sidhu went to search for his option so soon

 desh main mahangaai par aksar charchaa shuru ho jaati he, lekin jab sarkaar koi achche faisle karti he to uskaa koi zikr nahin karata
 "on July 22, at a rally in Gorakhpur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was accepting the oldest dilemma of Indian politics and economic management, which left no prime minister behind
 kai acchhee shuruyaaton ke baavjood mahangaai ne ''achche din" ke rajnatik sandesh ko buree tarah todaa he
 In the last two years, the government has not been able to come up with a new strategy or strategy to control inflation, whereas the international environment (falling prices of crude oil and commodities) has been favorable to India
 sarkaar kii chunauti yah he ki achche monsoon ke baavjood agle do varshon main tex, bazaar, maudrik niti ke morche par aisa bahut kuch hone vaala he, jo mahangaai kii duvidha ko badhayega
 Consumer inflation has started getting scorched in the first crop of rains in the cropped areas of India
 june main upabhokta keemten saat fisadi kaa aankada paar karte hue 22 maah ke sabase oonche str par pahunch gayi
 The mention of inflation in the shadow of a good monsoon should not be surprising
 mahangaai kaa taaja itihaas (2008 ke baad) gavaah he ki safal monusanon ne khaadya mahangaai par niyantran karne main koi prabhavi madad nahin kii he alabatta kharaab monsoon ke kaaran mushkilen bad jarur jaati hai
 The worst phase of inflation in India in the last five years has come under the shadow of better monsoons
 isliye monsoon se mahangaai main taatkaalik raahat ke alaava dirghakaalin ummiden jodpha tarksangat nahin he
 India's inflation has become complex, stubborn and multifaceted
 nayaa namoona mahangaai ke taaja aankade hai
 The rise in food prices is generally considered an urban challenge, but according to May data, the pace of inflation in rural areas was faster than in cities
 kheti ke sankat or gramin ilaakon main mazdooree dar main giravat ke bich gramin mahangaai ke tevar raajnneeti ke liye daraavne hai
 Despite the good monsoon, there are three major reasons that can lead to the challenge of inflation for the next two years
 sabase pehla kaaran sarkari karmchaariyon ke vetan main prastaavit badhotaree he
 India Ratings estimates that consumption after pay commission recommendations was Rs 45,100 crore
 kii badhotaree hogi
 Obviously, this decision will increase demand, but it will also give strength to inflation which is already on the rise
 jaise hi rajyon main vetan badhegaa, maang va mahangaai donon main ek saath or tej badhat najar aegi
 Under the leadership of Raghuram Rajan, the Reserve Bank was additionally strict on inflation and kept the flow of money in the market, keeping interest rates high
 kendriya bank kaa yah najariya dilli main vitt mantralay ko bahut raas nahin aayaa
 With Rajan's departure, the scale of fixing interest rates in India is changing
 ab ek maudrik samiti mahangaai or byaaj daron ke rishte ko nirdhaarit karegi
 Disagreeing with Rajan's view, the government will insist on liberal monetary policy in the coming months
 maudrik niti ke badale hue paimaanon se byaaj daren kam hon yaa na hon lekin mahangaai ko eendhan milanaa tay he
 The third major challenge is the rising tax
 pichley teen bajaton main tex lagaataar bade, jinka sidhaa asar jeb par hua
 Apart from these, the rates of rail fares, phone bills, internet, school fees were increased
 in sabane milakar pichley do saal main jindagi jeene kii laagat main bada ijapha kiya
 The biggest dilemma or apprehension about GST is that if the revenue of the states and the center is concerned, the GST rate will remain high
 jiesti kii taraf badhate hue sarkaar ko lagaataar sarvice tex kii dar badhaani hogi, jisaki chubhan pehle se hi badi hui he
 Expectations from the new government regarding the new and effective strategy of controlling inflation were quite high
 isaki vajah yah thi ki mulya vruddhi par niyantran ke maamle main pradhanmantri narendra modi nai sujh lekar aane vaale the
 Modi was seen as a supporter of the school of inflation by increasing supply in exchange for old ways of controlling inflation by shrinking demand (flow of money)
 yaad karnaa jaruri he ki modi ne gujarat ke mukhyamantri ke bataur ek samiti kii adhyakshata kii thi, jo mahangaai niyantran ke tareeke sujhane ke liye bani thi
 It submitted 20 recommendations and 64 point action plan to the then government in 2011, which was based on the principle of increasing supply
 samiti ne sujhaayaa tha ki khaadya utpaadon kii antarraji aapurti badhaane ke liye mandi kanoon ko khatm karnaa anivaary he
 The Modi committee was in favor of separating the purchase, stock and distribution by dividing the Food Corporation of India into three parts
 is samiti kii teesri mahatvapurn raay krishi bazaar kaa vyapak udaarikaran karne par kendrit thi
 Interestingly, in the last two and a half years, the Modi government itself has not been able to activate any of these recommendations
 sarkaar ne satta main aate hi mandi (apiemasi act) kanoon ko khatm karne yaa udaar banane kii koshish kii thi lekin ise bijepi shasit rajyon ne bhi bhav nahin diya
 The NDA government had formed a committee under the leadership of former food minister and BJP leader Shanta Kumar, which rejected the split and reorganization of FCI and reforms in food management and supply mechanism where it has remained
 modi sarkaar yadi logon ke ''man kii baat" samaj rahi he to use bazaar main aapurti badhaane vaale sudhaar shuru karne honge
 The fall in commodity prices in the international market is ready to help them
 darasal, mausami mahangaai utani badi chunauti nahin he jitani is apeksha kaa sthaayee ho janaa ki mahangaai kabhi kam nahin ho sakati
 In India, this assumption has scattered every effort to control inflation
 is dharna ko todgaye kii ranneeti taiyaar karnaa jaruri he anyathaa modi sarkaar ko mahangaai ke rajnatik va chunavi nuksaanon ke liye taiyaar rahanaa hoga, jo sarkaar ke puraani hone ke saath badhate jaaenge

 The use of plastic carry bags in Bihar has been notified for ban
 25 oktober se har prakaar ke kairi bag ke prayog parapratibandhrahegaa
 The government has taken this decision on the order of Patna High Court
 pehle patna hai court ke nirdesh par pratibandh 24 sitambar se lagane vaala tha lekin sarkaar ne taiyaariyon ke liye ek maheene kaa samay liya tha
 The Ministry of Environment and Forests has issued its notification
 adhisuchana ke mutabik,policinke utpaadan yaa baar-baar prayog par paanch saal kii jail or 1 lakh rupye jurmaane kaa praavdhaan he
 Not only 50 microns, but all types of carry bags are included in its scope
 haalanki sarkaar ne abtak ke stock ko khapaane ke liye 60 dinon kii mohalat bhi di he
 The process of punishment for use of polythene will begin from 15 December
 bain main sirf plastic kairi bag ko pratibandhit kiya gaya he jabaki baio west ke sangrahan or bhandaaran ke liye prayog hone vaale 50 microne se adhik ke kairi bag par pratibandh lagu nahin hoga
 Also, packaging of all types of food and other substances, bags used for growing milk and plants will also be free from this restriction
 isse pehle rajya sarkaar ne court kaa bharosa dilaayaa tha ki jaruri niyamavali banane ke baad purna pratibandh ke liye adhisuchana jari kar di jaaegi
 Apart from this, the government also told the court that after the complete ban of polythene in the cities from 25 October, it will be completely banned in the rural areas of the state on 25 November
 yani shaharon ke ek maheenaa baad gaanvon main polithin kaa istemaal nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Earlier, on September 24, the deadline for complete ban on polythene in Bihar was given by Patna High Court but at that time the state government had said that it is not fully ready for it
 isliye ab khud rajya sarkaar ne bihar ke shahari kshetron ko polithin rahit karne ke liye 25 oktober kii taarikh tay kii he

 National Capital Region (NCR) students are weak in mathematics, we are not saying NCERT report
 dillike 6 jilon main 230 skulon ke 4272studentsane is survey main bhaag liya tha
 In the National Achievement Survey of NCERT, it was revealed that in addition to patterns and multiplication, other sections of mathematics also have lower performance than the national average
 aapako bataa den ki 252 kii rashtriya ausat ke mukaable dilli kaa ausat 244 hi he
 At the same time, girls like Harfield perform better here in terms of language
 survey ke anusaar bhashaa main dilli sabase kharaab pradarshan karne vaale 8rajyonmen shaamil he
 At the same time, 6 states that perform weakly in mathematics are included
 khaadya suraksha vidheyak paas karaane ke liye sansad kaa vishesh satr bulaaye jane kii sarkaar kii pahal ke bich bijepi ne kaha ki vah iske khilaaf nahin he haalanki vah sansad ke monsoon satr ko kuch pehle bulaaye jane ke paksh main he
 Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj wrote on Twitter, 'there are reports in the media that the government is considering the option of calling an ordinance or special session of Parliament
 aise mahatvapurn kanoon ke liye adhyadesh laana upyukt nahin he
 We are not against calling a special session of Parliament
 ’haalanki, unhone kaha, ‘behatar vikalp monsoon satr ko samay se kuch pehle bulaanaa hoga jo july main hona he
 The bjp's support in this regard comes at a time when the UPA Coordination Committee meeting on the proposed Food Security Bill is scheduled to be held on Monday
 sarkaar is vishay par sarvadaleey baithak bulaane kii yojana bana rahi he
 PM Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) annual summit in the Russian city of Ufa
 aman pasand log yah ummid kar rahe hai ki baatcheet ke jariye donon deshon ke bich rishte main talkhi kam ho or seemaa par tanaav khatm ho
 Despite this, the modi-sharif meeting has more hope for sweetness in the india-pakistan relationship
 aisa isliye ki beete vakt main donon pradhanmantri ke bich mulaakaat yaa baat koi ummid nahin jagaa pai he
 
 
 1
 narendra modi or navaj sharif ne pichhali baar november, 2014 main kathmandu main dakshes (SAARC) sammelan main mulaakaat kii thi, lekin unke bich koi dwipaksheeya baithak nahin hui thi
 2
 haal hi main myanmar kii seemaa ke bheetar ugravadiyon ke khilaaf bharat kii sainya karrwai se bharat-pakistan ke rishton main or talkhi aa gai
 Pakistan was furious with the remark 'myanmar-like action in Pakistan too' and started making rhetoric against India
 3
 The first meeting between these two leaders was during the swearing-in ceremony of PM Modi
 isamen SAARC ke sabhi deshon ke rashtradhyakshon ko bulaayaa gaya tha, lekin sabase zyada focus modi-sharif ke bich baatcheet par hi tha
 This was Modi's better move in terms of diplomacy, although the relationship only got brighter
 4
 After Modi became PM, there was a possibility that there would be high level dialogue between India and Pakistan and the tension on the border would be reduced
 par videsh sachiv str kii vaarta se pehle bharat main pakistani ucchayukta ne kashmir ke algaavvaadi netaaon se mulaakaat karke vivaad khadaa kar diya
 India was angered and since then official talks between the two countries have not been held
 5
 Now, all kinds of things are happening about the meeting between Mododi and Sharif in Ufa
 lekin videsh maamalon ke jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki is mulaakaat se ummiden paalna galat hoga
 The two are meeting during the SCO Summit
 aise main dwipaksheeya baatcheet se zyada ummid bekaar he
 6
 lakhvi ke mudde par pakistan ko ab china kaa bhi saath mil gaya he
 In such a situation, Pakistan's stance may be more obstinate than before
 7
 Whenever the Heads of Government of India and Pakistan are about to meet, Pakistan creates tension by violating the ceasefire on the border
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki pakistan kii sena or aatank failaane vaale tatv jaan-boojhkar aisa karte hai, taaki donon deshon ke bich rishte kabhi saamaanya na ho saken
 This is proved by the ceasefire violation on the border on Thursday night and the martyrdom of an Indian jawan
 8
 The people of Pakistan may like peace, but diplomatists believe that the politics there can never befriend India
 pakistan kii siyasat ke lihaaj se bharat ko bhala-bura kahana vahaan ke netaaon ke liye zyada 'phydemand' he
 This is why relationships are not normal
 air india kii ek air hostess ne ek varisht adhikari par airline main kaam karne vaali tamaam mahilaon kaa yon shoshan karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 The air hostess has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Minister of Civil Aviation Suresh Prabhu and Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha
 air hostess kii yah chitthee kaaphi lambii he or usamen lagaae gaye aaropon ko sahi mana jaae to aaropee kii tulana harvey vinstin yaa bill cosby se kii ja sakati he
 According to the victim, the accused occupies a high position in Air India and despite many complaints, other senior officers, even women committees, have been taking the side of the accused
 padhie air hostess kii PM ko likhi puri chitthiere hostess kaa yah khat khun jamaa dene vaala or dimag ko sunn kar dene vaala he
 The complainant air hostess states that the accused officer proposed to make physical relations in front of her, indulged in indecency with her, talked about sex acts
 itnaa hi nahin air hostess kaa kahana he ki vah yah sari harakatein saalon se santhaan main kaam karne vaali anya mahila karmchaariyon ke saath bhi karata aa rahaa he
 Even the accused officer sexually abused other female employees in front of him
 peedita kaa kahana he ki jab usne aaropee adhikari kii baat nahin maani to uske saath bhedbhaav kiya jane laga
 The victim is married and has children
 haalanki ab vah bacchon ko lekar pati se alag rahati he
 It seems clear from the apathy written in the letter that the accused officer is very powerful and also has political opinions
 shikayatakarta airhostess ne likhaa he ki bharat sarkaar hi uski aakhri ummid he or use pradhanmantri narendra modi par puraa vishwaas he
 Addressing Suresh Prabhu in the letter, he wrote, 'now all my expectations are from you
 mujhe hamarapriy pradhanmantri narendra modior unke dwaara die gaye naare 'beti bachaao, beti padhaao' par puraa vishwaas he
 And i also believe that after educating daughters, you will not let such a huge injustice happen to them at the workplace
 'airhostess kii chitthee par naagarik uddyan mantri suresh prabhu ne tatkaal sangyaan le liya he
 He has tweeted, 'have asked the CMD of Air India for immediate investigation into the matter
 agar jaruri hua to duusari samiti gathit kii jaaegi
 ' ranvir singhpane kool andaaj or unic dressing sens kii vajah se charchaa main rahete hai

 Thank you Khan Saahab for always being the best Human being 
 @beingsalmankhan Thank you @rajcheerfull Sir, team @colorstv and super Emcee Jodi @salilacharya and @archanaapania # Biggboss # Bb12 # rjalok @oppomobileindia @oppo_mobilea post shared byrj Alok (@oyerjalok) onsep 5, 2018 at 8:05 pm Speaking on the dressing sense of a journalist on stage, Salman said, "who selects these clothes for you?" Then answering his own question, he says - Ranveer Singh
 '' jiske baad vahaan maujuud log hansane lagate hai
 Let me tell you, this video is becoming increasingly viral on social media
 pichley ek intervyuu main ranvir ne apane unic dressop par bolte hue kaha tha- ''mujhe jo pasand aata he main pahan letaa hum
 i wear clothes that make me happy, i wear them
 mujhe aalochana or jajment se fark nahin padataa
 Before Salman, Deepika also commented on Ranveer's style
 deepikane ranvir ko massej dete hue kaha tha- atarangi kapade pahananaa band karo
 In this world, no one can dare the devotees who worship Mother Kali
 maa kaali kii krupa ke aage kisi shaitan kaa jor nahin chalata kyonki maa kaali shakti swaroopa hai isliye agar aap khud ko asurakshit mahasoos karte hai
 So let us now tell you the special experiments to protect yourself, by which you can get the blessing of blessing from mother Kali
 
 
 
 Special use to protect oneself - Install a picture or idol of mother Kali on the heap of black sesame
 unke saamne deepak or guggal kii dhoop jalaaen
 Offer cloves equal to your age to the mother
 saath main ek chhed vaala tambe kaa sikaa bhi arpit karen
 In front of the mother, chant 27 beads of 'kree Hreen Kali Hrim Kreen Swaha'
 phir chhed vaala tambe kaa sikaa laal dhaage main daalkar gale main pahanen

 Actor Sanjay Dutt first saluted the national flag as soon as he got out of Yerwada jail in Pune
 sanjay kaa ye andaaj hairaan karne vaala tha kyonki iske pehle shaayad hi kisi mujrim ne sajaa puri hone ke baad jail se baahar nikal kar tirange ko salaam kiya hoga
 Sanjay Dutt himself did not salute the tricolor when Yerwada came out of jail after getting bail from the Supreme Court in 2007
 plastic kii thili main apana saamaan uthaaye apane dost usoof nalawaala ke saath wo sidhe baahar nikal gayi the
 The question is arising that did Munna Bhai do it easily or was everything already decided? It is also said that this salute can become an important part of Sanjay's biopic
 kyonki jail ke baahar munna bhai kaa swaagat karne khud rajkumaar hiraani bhi maujuud the
 Producer Suresh Rajkumar Hirani is taking Sanjay Dutt's personal life on celluloid
 duusare sanjay dutt ko bhale hi tada jaj pramod kode ne tada ke aarope se bari kar diya tha
 But the way Sanjay Dutt's name was linked to the 1993 bomb blasts during the investigation and the trial was like a stigma on Sanjay Dutt's forehead
 bari hone ke baad bhi wo daag unka peechha karata rahaa
 While the court sentenced Sanju Baba on charges of possessing weapons only
 jab bhi kabhi sanjay dutt parole or farlo par jail se chhot kar aate to media main unka ullekh 1993 bam dhamaakon se jodakar hi hota
 It is even more difficult for the common man to understand this closeness of law
 yahi vajah he ki 25 farvari ko sanjay dutt kii rihaai ke pehle or baad main kuch log deshadrohi likhe binar lekar unki rihaai kaa virodh karte bhi dikhe
 It is clear that Sanjay's mind was troubled for years
 jiskaa ullekh apane ghar par patrakaron se baat karte huye sanjay ne khud kiya
 Munna Bhai's request to the media that please do not add his name to the 1993 bomb blasts, in itself, tells a lot
 tippaniyan Apparently, Sanjay Dutt needed a symbol to prove himself to be a patriot so that the message should be sent to the whole country that he is not less than anyone in patriotism
 iske liye unhen isse uchit mauka mil nahin saktaa tha
 Perhaps that's why the PR agency's help was taken to capitalize on this opportunity and a complete blueprint was created to create a new image of Munna Bhai
 jisamen sanjay dutt kii jail se rihaai ke saath charter plane se mumbai aane
 There was a mention of coming to Mumbai first to visit the Siddhivinayak temple and then to the tomb of Maa Nargis
 to kya jail se baahar nikalate hi dharti ko chune or rashtradhvaj ko salaami kii baat jaanboojh kar gupt rakhi gai taaki wo sahaj lage lekin sabko hairaan kar jaye or khabar bane? vartmaan main deshbhakt or deshadroh ke mudde par uljhe desh main munna bhai kaa ye andaaj sabake man par prabhaav chhod gaya

 Second Sanjay Dutt may be acquitted by TADA judge Pramod Kode from TADA charge
 lekin jaanch or muqadame ke dauraan jis tarah se sanjay dutt kaa naam 1993 bam dhamaakon se judaa tha wo sanjay dutt ke maathe par ek kalank kii tarah tha
 Even after being acquitted, that stain followed him
 jabaki adaalat ne sanju baba ko sirf hathiyaar rakhane ke aarope main sajaa sunai thi
 Whenever Sanjay Dutt came out of jail on parole and furlough, he would be mentioned in the media only by linking him to the 1993 bomb blasts
 aam aadmi ke liye to kanoon kii is baariki ko samajhnaa or bhi mushkil he
 This is the reason that before and after the release of Sanjay Dutt on 25 February, some people were seen protesting his release with a banner written by the traitor
 saaf he ye baat sanjay ke man ko saalon se kachot rahi thi
 Which Sanjay himself mentioned while talking to reporters at his home
 munna bhai kaa media se ye nivedan ki krupa kar ke unka naam 1993 bam dhamaakon se naa joden, apane aap main kaaphi kuch bayaan kar jaataa he
 The comments jaahir he sanjay dutt ko khud ko deshbhakt sabit karne ke liye ek pratik kii jarurat thi jisase puure desh main ye sandesh jaye ki wo deshbhakti main kisi se kam nahin hai
 For this, they could not get a fair chance from it
 shaayad isliye is maukey ko bhunaane ke liye piaar agency kii madad lee gai or munna bhai kii ek nai chhavi banane kaa puraa khaakaa taiyaar kiya gaya
 Which included Sanjay Dutt's release from prison and coming to Mumbai from the charter plane
 mumbai aakar sabase pehle siddhivinayak mandir or phir maa naragis kii kabr par jane kaa zikr tha
 So, as soon as he gets out of jail, the matter of touching the earth and saluting the national flag was deliberately kept secret so that it looks comfortable but everyone is shocked and news is made? At present, this style of Munna Bhai left an impact on everyone's mind in the country embroiled on the issue of patriotism and treason
 bari hone ke baad bhi wo daag unka peechha karata rahaa
 While the court sentenced Sanju Baba on charges of possessing weapons only
 jab bhi kabhi sanjay dutt parole or farlo par jail se chhot kar aate to media main unka ullekh 1993 bam dhamaakon se jodakar hi hota
 It is even more difficult for the common man to understand this closeness of law
 yahi vajah he ki 25 farvari ko sanjay dutt kii rihaai ke pehle or baad main kuch log deshadrohi likhe binar lekar unki rihaai kaa virodh karte bhi dikhe
 It is clear that Sanjay's mind was troubled for years
 jiskaa ullekh apane ghar par patrakaron se baat karte huye sanjay ne khud kiya
 Munna Bhai's request to the media that please do not add his name to the 1993 bomb blasts, in itself, tells a lot
 tippaniyan Apparently, Sanjay Dutt needed a symbol to prove himself to be a patriot so that the message should be sent to the whole country that he is not less than anyone in patriotism

 Posted byatif Saeed Fine Art photographyonfriday, December 27, 2013 On Facebook page titled 'atif Saeed Fine Art Photography', this picture has been inserted with the caption 'angry King'
 bataaya jaataa he ki yah tasviir 2012 main khinchi gai thi or aatif lahore safari park ghoomane gaye the
 Now this picture is viral on the Internet
 aatif kehete hai, 'mujhe is sher ke gale par ghaney bal kaaphi pasand aae or yahi vajah thi, jiske kaaran main bina dare uski tasviir khinchne pahunch gaya
 "thrill of the picture," explains Aatif, "I came out of my car to take the picture and sat on the ground and threw stones at the lion
 mujhe uski gusse se bhari tasviir chahie thi
 Hearing the sound, the lion roared like me and stepped towards me to pounce
 main apane camere kii lens main use apni ore badhate hue dekh rahaa tha
 It was a wonderful moment, which i cannot describe in words
 'yah khuda kaa khayr hi he ki aatif ne na sirf acchhee tasviir khinchi balki surakshit car tak pahunchakar apni jaan bhi bachaai
 Atif says, 'the case was very close
 vah hansate hue kehete hai, 'shaayad ab main dobaaraa aisa nahin kar paaunga
 ' har daal ke apane paushtik gun hote hai
 By the way, lentils are rich in protein
 yahi vajah he ki bad rahe bacchon ko daal kaa adhik se adhik seven karne kii salaah di jaati he
 However, among all the pulses, moong dal is considered the most beneficial for health
 aamtaur par ise rogiyon ke bhojan ke taur par dekha jaataa he kyonki ye bahut jaldi pach jaati he
 But this does not mean at all that it fades in taste
 mung kii daal ko tareeke se banaaya jaae to yah bhi kisi bhi anya daal kii hi tarah swaadisht lagati he
 Many things are made from moong dal
 kuch log isse papad banaate hai, kuch badiyaan to kuch log iskaa laddu khaanaa pasand karte hai
 But moong dal pudding is a major part of Indian cuisine
 mung daal kii sabase badi khaasiyat ye he ki yah supachya hoti he or thandak pradaan karti he
 Benefits of Moong Dal: 1
 mung daal kii khichdi khaane se kabj kii samasya dur ho jaati he
 2
 mung ko halkaa garm karke pis le
 Then mix some amount of water in this powder and massage it all over the body like a paste
 agar aapako bahut adhik pasinaa aane kii shikaayat haito is lep se vah dur ho jaaegi
 3
 agar aapako daad, khaaj-khujali kii samasya he to mung kii daal ko chhilake sahit pis len
 Applying this paste on the affected area will benefit
 4
 The patient gets a lot of relief from its consumption while having typhoid, but the intake of plain moong dal is beneficial
 5
 The body becomes weak after any disease
 mung kii daal khaane se sharir ko takat milti he

 The court refused to hear the bail plea on behalf of Somnath Bharti's counsel, saying, "you had given the anticipatory bail plea, but now there is no justification after your surrender
" aise main aap trial court main nae sire se jamaanat kii arji den
 The Supreme Court can do nothing now

 Negotiations were going on for almost a year
 kiran bedi ne ab jaakar bhaajapa jwine kar hi lee
 Let's know what their plans are and what their plans may be
 guuruuvaar ko unhone 9 minute ke apane bhaashan main 9 baaten kahinkiran bedi ke bare main 10 dilachasp baaten
 
 
 1
 bedi kii body language us samay se hi dekhne laayak thi, jab amit shah bol rahe the
 He was being asked repeatedly whether Bedi would be the chief ministerial candidate
 shah baat ko taal rahe the
 (bedi could have guessed that she was most eager to get this answer public)
 2
 When Bedi's turn came to speak, he first thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for two minutes
 ve kah rahi thim ki unki prerana se hi ve raajnneeti jwine kar rahi hai
 (however, she has never been such a big supporter of Modi
 gujarat dange hon yaa vahaan kaa lokayukta, ve twitor par modi se sawaal karti rahi hai)3
 Bedi said that she wanted to give up her life in social service, but now BJP is joining at the behest of Modi
 (bedi aam aadmi party bhi jwine kar sakati thim, lekin vahaan unhen kejariwal se ooncha ohada mil paanaa mushkil tha)4
 Bedi was fast, as if she wanted to read her resume as soon as possible
 ek shikshak se lekar unhone police vibhaag main apni har posting kaa zikr kiya
 She did not even stop to tell about her two ngos
 (kisi bhi aam netaa kii tarah)5
 But interesting was his style of telling his own retirement story
 ve boleen ki police vibhaag ne unase junior afasar ko pramot karke dilli police kamishnar banaaya
 This was not acceptable to them
 phir unhone kaha ki post unke liye kabhi myne nahin rakhti
 (did not even care about the post and left the job for the post?) 6
 ritairement kii kahani main ve ek baat par or jor de rahi thim, vah thi unhen nazarandaaj karne kii
 She said that she left the post when she felt she was being ignored in the police department
 (ve shaayad bhaajapa ko sanket de rahi thim ki unhen nazarandaaj karnaa baari padataa he)7
 Bedi said that earlier she used to work around the country and the world
 ab dilli ko duniya kii sarvshereshth rajdhani banane ke liye mehnat karengi
 (however, earlier when she was asked about contesting elections from Delhi, she used to say that she is made for the whole country) 8
 sabase aakhir main bedi boleen ki mujhe 40 saal kaa prashasnic anubhav he
 How i work and get it done, i know everything
 (ab ye to vahi kah saktaa he jo mukhyamantri pad sanbhaalane ja rahaa ho)9
 She talks of running the government by connecting people in Delhi
 or khud ko mishan mod main bataa rahi hai
 (so what is the harm in this, BJP still needs such people) jammu kashmir is vakt surkhiyon main he
 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti seems to be very tough on many issues including Section 370
 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main mahabuuba ne kaha ki dhara 370 hataane kaa matlab bharat se kashmir ko kaat dena he
 In a special interaction with India Today Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai in Srinagar, Mehbooba Mufti said that Jammu and Kashmir is a Muslim dominated state
 bahut hi khaas halaat main kashmir kaa bharat ke saath vilay hua tha, isamen kai sharten thi
 It is not like the rest of the states
 bhartiya samvidhan ke tahat hamen dhara 370, vishesh darja or alag jhande ko lekar guarantee di gai
 This is the foundation of our relationship
 agar aap in sharton ko khatm karte hai to bharat se kashmir kaa rishta khatm ho jayega
 'kashmir became part of India on the basis of condition' Mehbooba Mufti, former CM of Jammu Kashmir said that Kashmir became part of India only on the basis of condition
 jammu-kashmir main 60 se 70 fisadi muslim hai
 Even after being a Muslim majority, why did we not go with Pakistan
 hamane bharat ko inhen sharton par chunaa
 Sections 370 and 35A are like a bridge
 agar aap ise khatm karenge to bharat or kashmir kaa rishta bhi khatm ho jayega
 On the question of alliance with BJP, Mehbooba Mufti said that when we joined hands with BJP, it was said that there will be no tampering with Section 370
 bijepi iske liye raji bhi ho gai thi
 We went with the BJP with all these things
 kashmir kaa apana piem hone vaale bayaan ko lekar puche gaye sawaal par mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki jab chunaav aata he to neshnal conference ko alag pradhanmantri hone kii baat yaad aati he
 It has formed the government with a majority
 us dauraan unhone alag piem hone kii baat nahin kii
 Sheikh Abdullah never did such a thing
 jahaan tak pidipi kii baat he to hamaara maananaa he ki kashmir kuch sharton par bharat kaa hissaa bana he or agar ye sharten tuutati hai to hamaara rishta bhi tut jayega

 kalam ke nidhan par cabinet baithak aaj, tay honge kaarykram Fasting is usually associated with reverence and devotion
 vahiin kuch log aise bhi hai jo ye sochakar vrath rakhte hai ki isi bahaane unka vajan kam ho jayega lekin kam hi logon ko pataa hoga ki vrath karnaa sehat ke liye bahut phydemand he
 Fasting cleanses the toxins present in the body
 iske saath hipachan kriya bhi pehle se behatar ho jaati he
 These are the 9 reasons on the basis of which we can say that the fasters live a long life
 1
 The fat burning process is accelerated during fasting
 jisase charbi teji se galanaa shuru ho jaati he
 2
 fat cells laptin naam kaa hormone straavit karti hai
 Getting less calories during fasting affects the activation of leptin and reduces weight
 3
 It is necessary to take some essential nutrients during the fast, or fasting may be painful for you
 vrath ke baad aap jab bhi kuch khaaen, koshish karen ki wo paushtik ho na ki fat se bharaa hua
 Otherwise the weight will increase rather than decrease
 4
 Fasting helps in the formation of new immune cells
 uniwarsity of south california ke visheshgyon kii maane to cancer ke marijon ke liye vrath rakhana bahut phydemand hota he
 Especially for patients who are taking chemotherapy
 5
 It is not necessary that you fast only when there is a religious occasion
 sharir kii andruni gandagi ko saaf karne or pachan kriya ko behatar banane ke liye aap kabhi bhi suvidhanusaar vrath kar sakate hai
 6
 kai adhyayanon main ye paaya gaya he ki kuch samay ke liye vrath rakhane se metabolic rate main 3 se 14 fisadi tak badhottaree hoti he
 If this is really the case then it will take less time to digest and burn calories
 7
 Fasting also keeps the mind healthy
 vrath karne se depressant or mastishk se judi kai samasyaon main phayda hota he
 8
 vrath karne ke dauraan aapako is baat kaa bhi andaja ho jaataa he ki aapkaa khanpan kitna galat he
 9
 aaj ke samay main tanaav ek bahut badi medical problem he
 Fasting reduces stress
 australian daure par kharaab form se jujh rahi team india ke liye fitness bhi ek badi samasya ban gai he
 The entire team, including captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, is upset over the injury to the management players

 dhoni ke mutabik 'ishanth ne nets main gendbaaji kii or uske ghutane main sujan aa gai, jab tak main press conference main aayaa, tab tak sab thik tha, is pareshaani ke bare main mujhe baad main pataa chalaa
 
 
 ' bhubaneshwar kumaar takhne main lagi chot ke kaaran pehle teen test maichon main nahin khele
 He was on the field in the fourth Test, but it was clear that he was not fully fit yet
 do van-de maichon main bhi unki gati kaaphi dhimi thi or pradarshan bhi kharaab rahaa
 Ravindra Jadeja's shoulder injury also made a lot of headlines, after emerging from the injury, he got the opportunity to bowl and bat in a one-day match, but he failed with both the ball and bat and experts questioned his fit
 Pick up

 Although there will not be a fitness update as usual from the board, but the practice match against Australia on 8 February will make the picture quite clear

 In such a situation, strong innings will be expected from Kohli again
 kohli kii koshish hogi ki jis tarah se test siries main england ko shikast di usee tarah vanade muqablon main bhi use patkhni den
 Dhoni will play as a batsman for the first time, Mahendra Singh Dhoni will take the field as a wicketkeeper batsman this time
 aise main un par captaini kaa dabaav nahin hoga
 Dhoni, one of the finest finishers in the world, will need a big innings
 dhoni kaa haalia form behad kharaab rahaa he
 Captain Kohli has previously said that Dhoni can be sent for third or fourth number of balls
 aise main phens ko ummid hogi ki wo ek damdaar ballebaaji kaa jalawaa dikhaaen

 Prashant Kanaujia's lawyer said that the Supreme Court has justified the arrest
 vakil nebatayaki supreme court ne police kii karrwai par kaha ki usne galat kiya yaa sahi is par koi tippanee nahin kar rahaa hum
 Earlier during the hearing, the court asked the UP government, 'what is the tweet, it does not mean, under which provision arrest has been made
 supreme court ne aage kaha, hamane record dekha he,ek naagarik ke swatantraaa ke adhikaar main dakhal diya gaya he
 Opinions may vary '
 vahiin upi sarkaar ne yachika kaa virodh kiya or kaha ki giraftaar ke baad magistrate ke saamne pesh kiya gaya tha
 The tweet was very abusive
 is parasupreme court ne upi sarkaar ke vakil se poocha ki is tarah kii saamagree publish nahin honi chahie lekin giraftaar kyon kiya gaya
 The Supreme Court asked the UP government under which sections the arrest was made? "the court said that it was not right to share the objectionable post but the arrest was about it? The Supreme Court asked the petitioner, why did you not go to the High Court on this matter
 upi sarkaar kii ore se ASG vikramjit banerjee ne kaha, ye twit behad apmanjanak the, hamane IPC 505 bhi lagaai he
 The court further questioned what is the mischief in it? Usually, we do not hear such a petition, but in this way we cannot keep a person in jail for 11 days
 ye cese hatya kaa nahin he
 While hearing the case, Justice Indira Banerjee said, Prashant should be released immediately

 Can not be left as such
 court ne kaha, ham aise baton ko pansad nahin karte lekin sawaal he ki kya use salaakhon ke peeche rakhaa rakhaa janaa chahie
 We are neither canceling nor staying the action
 upi sarkaar ne kaha, ''is maamle main magistrate kaa aadesh he or use chunauti diya janaa jaruri he
 "the Supreme Court said," We are living in this country which is probably the best constitution in the world
 kanoon ke mutabik chaliye lekin prashanth ko reeha kariye
 "to which the UP government said," This will also affect the trial "
 supreme court ne phir kaha,'ham twit ko manjuur nahin karte lekin aazaadee ke adhikaar ke hanan ko bhi naamanzoor karte hai
 The UP government said, "the tweets are very humiliating
 inkaa asar padataa he''
 The court said, do not assume that all social media posts are accepted
 log samajhadaar hai, soshal media par agar kuch post hota he to wo sab kuch sahi nahin hota
 People know very well which post is correct or not
 After this, a bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and Justice Ajay Rastogi gave the order and said, "UP government should release Prashant Kanaujia
 ham is maamle main post kii prakruti par koi tippanee nahin kar rahe hai
 The question is to deprive someone of freedom
 ''supreme court ne kaha, ''vahek naagarik he or uske adhikaar hai
 The constitution of the country gives the right to live and freedom of expression
 yachikakarta ke pati ko adhikaron se vanchit nahin rakhaa ja saktaa
 These rights cannot be negotiated

 ) Thousands of crowd attended the 'howdy Modi' event held in Houston, Texas, USA
 piem modi (PM Modi)kaa bhaashan sunakar aisa lag rahaa tha ki jaise vah kisi chunavi raily ko sambodhit karne aae hon
 At the same time, looking at the President of America, Donald Trump, it seemed that he was in the mood for the elections going to be held next year and trying to woo thousands of indian-americans who came there
 aapako bataa den ki america main bhartiya samudaay ke log ab itani sankhya main hai ki unke vot chunaav ke nateezon ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 But during this event, a statement by PM Modi can become difficult for the President of America, Donald Trump and the statements of the Prime Minister of India can become an issue
 pichley america chunaav (2016) se pehle bharat main hue loksabhaa chunaav (2014) ke dauraan 'abaki baar modi sarkaar' kaa naaraa bahut chalaa tha or narendra modi desh ke pradhanmantri bhi ban gaye
 In order to woo indian-americans along the same lines, Donald Trump also released a video during the presidential election and said, 'abki Bar Trump Government' and this electoral slogan captivated the Indian community
 isi baat par ravivaar ko jab piem modi huston main bhartiya samudaay ko sambodhit kar rahe the to unhone is naare ko phir yaad dilaayaa, 'abaki baar trump sarkaar'
 PM Modi reminded the people of Indian origin present at the stadium that Trump had said, 'this time Trump government'
 unhone kaha ki trump ke shasankaal main white house main diwaali manaaya janaa bhi anokhaa rahaa
 Just before the election, such a statement of the leader of an external country which has been used in the election, may become an issue of meddling in the elections in America
 congress netaa anand sharma ne bhi unke bayaan par aapatti jataai he ki is tarah ke bayaan donon deshon kii samprabhutaa or loktantr main dakhlandaji he
 He said that you (PM Modi) are as our Prime Minister and not as the star campaigner of Trump
 Our relationship with the United States of America have throughout been bipartisan, vis-à-vis Republicans and Democrats
 Your actively campaigning for Trump is a breach of both India and America as sovereign nations and democracies

 Recently, in the meeting held in Delhi to finalize the ticket for Madhya Pradesh, former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia had clashed in front of Rahul Gandhi

 Although the Congress did not get support of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the state assembly elections, it is not disheartened

 dilli vishvavidhyalay kaa ek college he ramajas
 Ramjas College was established by Raj Kedar Nath in 1917
 is saal is college ke sau saal puure ho gaye
 At that time our ancestors started raising the slogan of independent India
 'hamen chahie azaadi' vaala aajkal kaa naaraa to nahin tha magar us vakt ke har naare kaa yahi matlab hota tha ki 'hamen chahie azaadi'
 Now we must have many slogans in favor and opposition to the slogan of independence
 jo vahaan nahin bolaa ja sakaa, kya wo yahaan bolaa ja saktaa he
 Ramjas College is not such a college
 elit maahaul ke bich khantee mizaaj kaa bada hi aitihaasik college he
 Seminars were organized on 21 February and 22 February as part of the spirit of the college preamble
 bhaavana kya thi ki chaatr explor karenge
 The seminar did not happen the way it was thought, but the culture of protest was seen in Ramjas College, which was not in the content list of the seminar
 sawaal silebus se baahar kaa aa gaya
 There is a long and frightening story of how the boys reach and surround the girls inside the conference room
 main vaise bhi ghatana ke sabhi pahalu kii reporting nahin kar rahaa balki kuch mahatvapurn pahaluon ko yahaan rakh rahaa hum
 There may be some lapses in this case
 baharhaal itnaa aasaan nahin he ki chaatro ko khulkar media ke saamne aana, phir bhi kai saamne aa rahe hai
 They know what will happen to them later when they are called alone to the police station
 ramajas ke ek chaatr ne kaha bhi ki apane hi college se police, chor kii tarah nikaal kar le gai or jin par shaq tha ki wo maarane waalon main shaamil the, wo hans rahe the
 They were making fun of him
 police ne apni galati maani he to maan kar chalanaa chahie ki bahut bura hone ke baad ye kuch acha hua he
 But she is pleading with the complainants for help in the investigation
 bheed kii jaanch kabhi nattejey par nahin pahunchati he
 The ABVP and leftist organizations have applied for the police, both of which have held their own protests
 dilli he to itnaa kuch ho gaya, jodhpur ke jai narayan vyas uniwarsity ko ek professor ko isliye nilambit kar diya, kyonki unhone nivedita menon ko bolne ke liye bulaayaa tha, kuch nahin hua
 What does Nivedita Menon say that shakes the foundation of the Indian Republic? ham itnaa kamazor kab se ho gaye hai
 You don't know who did what after the crowd became more turbulent
 mul sawaal se sab bhatak jate hai or phir baat jeenyu par pahunchati he, kashmir par jaati he, vahaan se laut kar deshbhakti par aa jaati he
 Through these things, the killers are saved or the accused are confounded
 sirf naare sunai dete hai
 Those who kill are saved with the help of these slogans
 jeenyu kaa zikr hua he to lage haath bataa dete hai
 Last year was the February incident
 kitna bavaal hua tha
 The media and political parties clashed with each other leaving all work
 jis mudde ko lekar abhi or isi vakt faisla ho rahaa tha, wo ab kahaan hai
 In Vyapam scam, admission of 634 students studying MBBS was canceled
 inaki zindagi ek tarah se barbaad ho gai
 These students also took advantage of the system and the people associated with the system earned crores through these students
 kya aapane kisi bhi dal ke chaatr sanghathan ko 634 medical chaatro ko shikaar banane vaale system ke khilaaf bharat mata kii jai yaa laal salaam salaam ke naare lagaate dekha he
 Have seen someone spewing fire on the question of employment
 tippaniyan Omar Khalid is on the vine
 ek saal se aarope patr nahin bana or na hi trial
 So can you consider him a punishment? umr kalid bastar main adivaasiyon ke virodh pradarshan par piechdi kar rahe hai
 Went to speak on this agar mauka miltaa to ve kya bolte
 The second speech at Ramjas College was by Maya Rao
 maaya raav kaa vishay tha bodies in protest
 For the general audience, this will be a heavy topic, but understand this that many people are discriminated against due to their body texture
 samalangik samaaj apane adhikaron ke liye jab ladata he to us ladaai ke centre main wo sharir hi hota he jise lekar ham tarah-tarah kii betuki dharanaen banaate hai
 Maya Krishna Rao is a theater artist
 unhone ramajas main bataaya ki aam virodh pradarshnon or theatre yaa naatak ke zariye pradarshnon main kya antar hota he
 There was a strong performance in America under the name 'acupai Wall Street'
 ek vishay tha accupai campus
 When a woman comes to the campus, she does not get a chance to equalize
 is vishay par bolne vaali sristi shrivastav kaa maananaa he ki ladakiyon ke liye campus ko loktantric banaaya janaa chahie
 Srishti runs a 'cage break' campaign
 jaise ladke hostel main der raat bhi laut sakate hai, ladkiyaan shaam ko baahar hi nahin ja sakati
 The cage break raises such a subject
 conference room ke bheetar jo ladke ladkiyaan kis tarah pahunche or ghir gaye, isaki lambii or bhayaavah kahani he
 i am not reporting all aspects of the incident anyway, but i am putting some important aspects here
 ho saktaa he is maamle main kuch chook ho jaae
 However, it is not so easy that students are exposed to the media openly, yet many are coming forward
 unhen pataa he ki baad main jab ve akele police thane bulaaye jaayenge to unke saath kya-kya hoga
 a student of Ramjas said that the police had taken him out of his own college as a thief and those who suspected that he was involved in the killing were laughing
 unka mazaaq uda rahe the
 If the police have accepted their mistake then it should be assumed that something good has happened after it has gone very bad
 lekin wo shikayatakartaaon se hi jaanch main madad kii guhaar laga rahi he
 Crowd investigations never lead to conclusions
 abivipi or vampanthi sanghathanon ne police ko arji di he, donon ne apane apane virodh pradarshan kiye hai
 So much has happened in Delhi, a professor has been suspended from Jai Narayan Vyas University in Jodhpur because he called Nivedita Menon to speak, nothing happened
 nivedita menon aisa kya bol detii he ki jisase bhartiya ganatantr kii buniyaad hill jaati
 How long have we become so weak
 bheed or hallaa ho jane ke baad aapako pataa nahin chalata ki kisne kya kiya
 Everyone wanders off from the original question and then the matter reaches JNU, goes to Kashmir, returns to patriotism
 in baton ke zariye maarane waalon ko bachaa liya jaataa he yaa phir aarope lagane waalon ko ulajhaa diya jaataa he
 Only slogans are heard
 maarane waalon ko in naaron ke sahare bachaa liya jaataa he
 If JNU is mentioned, then hands tell
 pichley saal farvari kii ghatana thi
 There was so much ruckus
 sara kaam chhodkar media or raajnneetik dal aapas main bhid gaye
 The issue was being decided now and at the moment, where are they now? vyapam ghotaale main embibies kii padhai kar rahe 634 chaatro kaa admician cancel kar diya
 His life was ruined in a way
 in chaatro ne bhi system kaa phayda uthaaya or system se jude logon ne in chaatro ke zariye karodon kamaaye
 Have you seen any group of student organizations shouting slogans like Bharat Mata ki Jai or Lal Salaam Salam against the system that hunts 634 medical students
 rojgaar ke sawaal par kisi ko aag ugalate dekha he
 The comments umr khalid bel par he
 Charge sheet has not been made nor trial for one year
 to kya aap use sazaayaftaa maan sakate hai
 Omar Khalid is doing his phd on the protest of the tribals in Bastar
 isi par bolne gaye
 What would they say if given a chance
 ramajas college main doosraa bhaashan maaya raav kaa tha
 The theme of Maya Rao was Bodies in Protest
 aam darshakon ke liye ye baari bharkam topic lagegaa magar ise aap samajhiye ki bahut logon ke saath unke sharir kii banaavat ke kaaran hi bhedbhaav hota he
 When a gay society fights for its rights, it is the body at the center of that fight with which we form various absurd beliefs
 maaya krishna raav theatre kalakaar hai
 He explained in Ramjas what is the difference between general protests and demonstrations through theater or drama
 'accupai wal street' naam se america main zordaar pradarshan hua tha
 One topic was the Acupai Campus
 ek mahila jab campes main aati he to use barabari kaa mauka nahin miltaa he
 Srishti Srivastava, who speaks on this subject, believes that the campus should be democratized for girls
 shrrishti 'pinjadaa tod' abhiyaan chalaati hai
 Just as boys can return to hostels late at night, girls cannot go out in the evening
 pinjadaa tod is tarah ke vishay ko uthaata he

 priti bhi sanjay ko chaahati thi
 But both their families were against this relationship
 isliye beeti raat donon ghar se faraar ho gaye
 When Priti did not return home till late night, the family started searching for her
 is dauraan pataa chalaa kii sanjay bhi shaam se apane ghar nahin lautaa he
 Family members along with the villagers kept searching for both but they both could not find any

 ) Exams of Outer Class are about to end, that is, the dream of college life in the eyes will start soon for some youngsters
 aise main dilli kii sadakon par kai uniwarsity or coljon ke posters dikhne bhi shuru ho gaye hai
 But do you know that many of these colleges are not recognized accreditation from UGC i
e
 fake, where even after spending lakhs of rupees there is no guarantee of job
 chaaron ore banners or vigyaapan kii bharmaar he
 Where you look, big claims are being made to build your future
 lekin ye wo college or uniwarsity hai jo yuvaaon ke bhavishya se khilwaad kar rahe hai
 Do BA in one year while sitting at home, even if you fail outside, you can become a teacher
 koi bhi in vaadon kii taraf aasaani se aakarshith ho saktaa he
 But before you too get caught in their travesty, just wait
 
 
 kya aap jaanate hai ki ye wo college yaa vishvavidhyalay hai jinhen ujisi se manyata nahin mili he
 In fact, the UGC website has the names of 6 such universities of Delhi which are illegally operating in Delhi
 ujisi ke mutabik dilli main chal rahi farji uniwarsity ke naam hai
 1
 varanasi sanskrit vishvavidhyalay2
 Commercial University 3
 united nesan uniwarsity4
 Vocational University 5
 ediaar uniwarsity or6
 Most of the university's addresses turned out to be fake when IISE University investigated the reality of these universities till date
 dariyaganj ke post offis building main duusare floor par chal rahi he commercial uniwarsity, wo bhi sirf ek hi haul main
 After reaching here and talking to the staff, it was found that the university was closed many years ago
 in farji vishvavidhyalayon ke apane tark hai lekin ujisi kii vevesite inaki pole kholane ke liye kaaphi he
 Experts also believe that if they get into the trap of these colleges, then it is difficult to get out of their trap
 jab baat aapke bhavishya kii ho to jaraa si chook aage chalakar badi pareshaani ban sakati he
 Time's director Ulhas Vairagkar says, many times students come to us that our score is not good but letters come to them, they are getting admission, but i would say that what would be easy is the importance of that college degree
 chaatro ke bhavishya ke saath khule aam khilwaad ho rahaa he
 What future will the educational institutions give to these students after not being recognized by UGC
 dilli kii tang galiyon ke bich kai aise college chal rahe hai jo na sirf paas karne kii guarantee dete hai balki naukari dilaane kaa bhi bharosa dilaate hai
 But the reality is something else
 in farji vishvavidhyalayon ke daavon ko jaanane ke liye phone karne par ek jagah se jo jawaab mila wo to hairat main daalane vaala tha
 The person said on the phone that despite failing, he will give us BA degree
 lekin jo degree milegi wo ujisi manyata praapt uniwarsity kii nahin hogi
 Without trusting these fake universities, without working hard you will become a graduate
 lekin ye wo degree he jo aapako kahin bhi acchhee naukari nahin dilaa sakati
 Such colleges and universities are playing with your future to earn money, do not let them succeed
