 The European Union was followed by a second chance of major tampering with the currency in Europe in January 2002, when 11 countries of the European Union implemented the new Euro currency (later the 12th country Greece implemented)
 haalanki, euro kaa janm 1999 main ho chukaa tha or ye sabhi desh teen saal tak is nai karency ko legal tender ghoshit karne ke liye taiyaari kar rahe the

 is karency sudhaar kaarykram se soviet union main manhagaai par lagaam nahin lagaaya ja sakaa

 yah virodh pradarshan ek saal tak chalata rahaa or phir sarkaar ne badi barbarta ke saath iskaa daman kar diya
 The end result was that thousands of civilians who were protesting were killed by army bullets
 haalanki, iskaa pahalu ye bhi he ki jin deshon mennotebandilagu hui thi puri tarah lekin bharat main keval 1000 or 500 ke note band kiye gaye hai

 He said that we are going to give seven and a half lakh crore rupees to rural India in the coming seven years, as well as asked what the Congress gave to the farmers in 10 years? Why were the announcements made for the farmers in the interim budget only? But he said that the government has helped the farmer families in every budget by giving all the subsidies including neem coated urea, electricity connection
 tex slab na badalane ke sawaal or 5 lakh rupee tak kii seemaa par bhram failane or aalochana hone ke sawaal par goyal ne kaha ki madhyam vargeey pariwaron ko hamane 23 hajaar karod rupee kii madad di he, jo shaayad hi ekasaath pehle kabhi kisi bajet main di gai ho

 unhone daawa kiya ki modi sarkaar main arthvyavastha saaf suthri hui he or vikaas kaa laabh desh ke kone-kone tak pahunchaa he
 Piyush Goyal said why is it that he (congress) did not think for the healthcare of the farmers, as we did? Why is it that he never bothered to provide electricity, as we did? Apart from making long promises, the Congress did nothing

 Gold has been given great importance in Indian tradition
 diwali or dhanteras par to khaastaur par isaki kharid shubh maani jaati he
 But often complaints of sleep disturbances are also found
 aise main sone kii shuddhta kaa pataa lagane ke tareeke kii jaankaree honi jaruri he
 There is no need to be afraid now about the identity of gold
 ab aap bhi kuch baton kaa dhyaan rakhkar aasaani se asli sone ko pahchaan sakate he
 Let's know these sure tips to identify real gold - Buy Hallmark Jewelery only
 If you want to avoid buying fake gold then always buy Hallmark Jewelery
 hollmark yaa standard mark sone kii jewelery ke liye bhartiya maanak beuro (biies) dwaara pradaan kiya jaataa he
 But in such a situation it is also necessary to see if the hallmark is fake or not? Keep in mind that the original hallmark has a triangular mark on the Bureau of Indian Standards
 saath hi holmarking centre ke logo ke saath sone kii shuddhta bhi likhi hoti he
 This is a very reliable and effective method to identify with acid test, when you want to find out about real gold by yourself
 iske liye aap pin se sone par halkaa sa kharoch (scrtch karen) lagaaein or phir us kharoch par nitric acid kii ek boond daalen
 If that gold is fake, then the gold will immediately turn green and if your gold is real then there will be no difference in its color
 magnet test vishwasaneey tareekajab bhi aap sona kharidne jaae, apane saath strong chumbak lekar jaaen
 Remember that real gold never sticks to the magnet and if the gold is attracted to the magnet even a little, then there is a problem and avoid buying it
 pani main dubaa kar dekhenshayad hi aapako pataa ho ki sona kabhi bhi pani par tairta nahin he, balki dub jaataa he
 If you want to identify real gold then dip the gold in a glass of water
 agar sona puri tarah dub jaataa he to vah asli hoga
 If it starts floating on the surface of the water, then understand that it is fake
 sone kii keemat pahachanensone kii keemat uske carat ke hisaab se tay kii jaati he
 The higher the carat, the more expensive the gold will be
 ham sona 24 carat or jewelery 22 carat kharidte hai, jisaki keemat bahut kam hoti he
 If you want to know the price of 22 carat gold, then divide the 24 in the price of 24 carat gold and multiply it by 22, so that you will know the price of 22 carat gold
 vishwasaneey dukaanon se kharideshgar aapako phir bhi thage jane kii dar ho to hameshaa vishwasaneey dukaan se hi sona khariden
 Large showrooms and popular shops can be relied upon for this
 aisa isliye kyonki bade shorum aapako sone ke asli honeco lekar puure jaruri dastavej dete hai
 So when you go to sell it, you do not lose much
 iske alaava sone ke khanak par bhi dhyaan den
 The real gold tins are heavy while the fake gold gives the sound of falling iron

 paanch saal pehle kai raajnneetik vivaadon ke baad amitabh bachchan or maharashtra navnirmaan seva (emenes) ke chif raaj thakare ke bich jo dooriyaan aa gayi thi wo ab khatm hoti najar aa rahi hai
 It seems that both have forgotten the controversy in 2008
 sadi ke mahanayake 'emenes film wing' ke saalagirah ke jashn main chif guest ke taur par pahunchenge or raaj thakare ke saath manch bhi saajha karenge
 Big b and Raj Thackeray will be on the same stage
 
 
 emenes film wing 'maharashtra navnirmaan chitrapat sena' (emensiechaes) cinema ke 100 saalon kaa jashn manayega or is dauraan film or mujeec industry kii kai diggaj hastiyon ko sammanit bhi kiya jayega
 The function is scheduled to be held on 23 December at Shanmukhanand Hall, the very next day of Narendra Modi's rally in Mumbai
 lekin is event kii khaas baat hogi ki big bi or raaj thakare ek hi stage par saath najar aaenge
 The two veterans were seen together 5 years ago
 
 
 haalanki aisa pehali baar nahin ho rahaa he ki big bi or raaj thakare is tarah saath najar aaenge
 Earlier in 2008, when Raj Thackeray released a photo biography of his uncle Bala Saheb Thackeray, Big had also arrived as a guest at the event, when Raj was associated with the Shiv Sena
 kuch yun shuru hua tha vivaad
 
 
 After separating from Shiv Sena in 2008, Raj Thackeray formed his own party MNS and became very aggressive about Marathi vs North Indians
 isi ke baad se bachchan family or raaj thakare ke bich dooriyaan badhani shuru ho gayi
 In February 2008, Raj Thackeray had targeted Big b in one of his speeches, saying, "amitabh Bachchan works in Maharashtra and lives here but became a brand ambassador from Uttar Pradesh
 to isamen kya buraai he main maharashtra se pyaar karata hum?' raaj thakare kaa ye bhaashan amitabh ke us bhaashan kaa jawaab tha, jo unhone uttar pradesh main diya tha or kaha tha, 'main bhale kahin bhi rahun lekin hameshaa 'chhora ganga kinarevaala' hi rahoonga
 Jaya Bachchan's statement raised controversy
 
 
 is puure vivaad ke baad abhishek bachchan kii film 'dron' ke mujeec relies ke maukey par jaya bachchan ne bhi raaj thakare par vyangybaan chhod die the
 On which Raj Thackeray threatened to apologize that if this did not happen, his party would not allow any film of a member of Bachchan family to run in Maharashtra
 jiske baad big bi ne puure maamle par safai di thi
 Still, Jaya Bachchan said during a press conference in Mumbai, targeting Raj Thackeray, "I only know Bala Saheb Thackeray, apart from this, i don't know any Thackeray
" ' haalanki is dauraan bachchan parivaar ke sambandh bala sahib thakare or uddhav thakare se kaaphi achche rahe
 When Raj Thackeray gave clarification on the dispute
 
 
 2008 ke baad emenes ke majboot hoti gai lekin iske baad raaj thakare ne kabhi big bi par nishaanaa nahin saadhaa
 Not only this, in an exclusive interview given to India Today in 2011, he said that he is a big fan of Amitabh Bachchan's films
 unhone kaha tha, 'maine bas tulana karte hue kaha tha ki jab amitabh bachchan jaisi shakhsiyat jo puure desh sambandh rakhti he, wo apane rajya ko pyaar kar sakate hai to main kyon nahin?' jo kuch bhi hua uske baad se donon ke bich rishte kabhi saamaanya nahin ho paae
 But now Big b has agreed to come to the event, then this dispute will also end here

 The Sheena Bora murder case has a new twist
 indrani mukherjee ne buudhvaar ko khaar thane main apni vakil gunjan mangala ko baatcheet ke dauraan bataaya ki usne bete mikhail ko god liya tha
 The legal team, which defended Indrani, still knew that both Sheena and Indrani were her children
 lekin is khulaase ne legal team ko hairaan kar diya he
 Not guilty, quoting the confession revealed that Indrani has refused to accept the crime of killing Sheena

 His lawyers put this on record saying that they wanted to communicate with their clients in private, but the police was not ready for this
 indrani ke vakil ab apni maang ko lekar bombai ucch nyaayalay jane kii yojana bana rahe hai
 He demands that no policeman should be present during the conversation of his lawyers with Indrani
 unhen akele main baat karne di jaae
 Indrani's permission not narco
 Indrani's lawyers told her that the police could not conduct her narco test without her permission
 or na hi uske liye majaboor kar sakati he
 He told Indrani that narco test can only be done with the permission of the accused

 uttar pradesh kii kairana loksabhaa upachunaav main areldi kii tabassum hasan ne bijepi kii ummidavaar mriganka singh ko maat di he
 The same RLD which was completely marginalized after being beaten in the Lok Sabha and then Assembly elections
 kairana main party ne apane mul vot bank jat samudaay ko bijepi kheme se waapas laakar apni raajnneeti ko sanjivani de di he
 Not only this, the RLD has once again succeeded in bringing the Muslim Jats together
 areldi ko mili jeet se party pramukh choudhary ajit singh kaa kad bad gaya he
 The RLD may also be an important part of the grand alliance formed by opposition parties against Modi in 2019
 itnaa hi nahin ajit singh sammanjanak siton ke mol bhav karne kii sthiti main aa gaye hai
 Explain that western Uttar Pradesh is called Jat Land
 pradesh main 10 se zyada loksabhaa sitenhain, jahaan jat samudaay kingmekar kii bhoomika main he
 These include Fatehpur Sikri, Mathura, Aligarh, Hathras, Baghpat, Kairana, Bijnor, Ghaziabad, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar Lok Sabha seats
 haalanki in siton par areldi akele dam chunaav nahin jeet sakati he
 The alliance becomes important for this
 gauratlab he ki november 2013 main mujffarnagar dangon ke baad pashchimiuttar pradesh main jat or muslim samudaayake bich khai gahari ho gai thi
 The stars of RLD politics were sinking
 areldi ke saamne sabase badi chunauti jat vot ko waapas apane paale main laane kii thi, jo 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or baad main 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main usase chhitakkar bijepi ke kheme main chalaa gaya tha
 The result was that Ajit Singh himself lost in the Lok Sabha elections and the party could not win even a single seat
 jabaki vidhansabha chunaav main ek hi vidhayak jeet sakaa tha, jo baad main bijepi main chalaa gaya
 But now that the opposition unity has been formed, Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary have been able to re-establish this Jat and Muslim alliance through the Kairana Lok Sabha by-election
 areldi ummidavaar tabassum hasan ke bahaane choudhary ajit singh ne apana khoyaa hua janaadhar waapas paa liya he
 Till 2019, if they are successful in keeping the Jat community with the party, then their importance will remain in the Grand Alliance and appropriate seats can also come to their account

 In the India Today Conclave 2019 session, 'kaun Jeetega Bharat 2019 and 2019', many political analysts expressed their opinion
 in vishleshkon se pulavama aatanki hamale ke baad narendra modi sarkaar kii ranneeti or pakistan main ghuskar aatankiyon ke khilaaf air strike kaa bhartiya janata party ko laabh milegaa yaa nahin ye sawaal bhi kiya gaya
 In response to this question, some analysts said that the positive impact of Pulwama should go to the bjp's account, while the others said that this assessment was hasty
 is satr main rajaneta or vishleshak yogendra yadav, jain uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar professor sandip shastri, si-voter ke chif editor yashavanth deshmukh, congress ke data analytics vibhaag ke chairman praveen chakravarti, exis maay india ke siio pradeep gupta, today chanakya ke siio ve
 K
 bajaj or seepiaar ke phelo rahul verma ne shirkat kii
 In response to whether the current Modi government will benefit from Pulwama in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Yogendra Yadav is a factor, but it is too early to assess
 haalanki, professor sandip shastri ne kaha ki raajnneeti main do hafte kaa vakt bhi kaaphi hota he or jo ghatnakram pulavama ke baad hua he, hindi pattee ke rajyon main iskaa kuch laabh bijepi ko mil saktaa he
 Today Chanakya CEO VK Bajaj has considered Pulwama as a factor
 unhone kaha ki kai factor hai jo chunaav main kaam karenge, unamem se ek pulavama ho saktaa he
 VK Bajaj said that how much will be gained in the election, it cannot be said, but the government has definitely got energy from it
 pulavama hamale ke baad bhartiya vayusena kii strike ko lekar india today ke political stock exange (PSE) par vishleshkon se sawaal kiya gaya
 Actually, this survey of India Today Group and My Axis India has revealed that the most credit for the air strike goes to Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 survey main 44 fisadi logon ne piem modi ko air strike kaa shrey diya he, jabaki 40% bhartiya vayusena or 11% sena ko diya he
 Giving an example, Yogendra Yadav has rejected outright on these figures
 unhone udhaaharan diya ki agar aap kisi se puuchhen ki chota rasgusla khaanaa he yaa bada to har koi bada khaane ke liye kahegaa
 But after that the price of that big rasgulla is told, then people will say that no small work will be done
 iske baad agar ye bhi kah diya jaae ki rasagulle main thodaa sa jehar he to koi bhi use khaane se inkaar kar degaa
 From this example, Yogendra Yadav tried to explain that if people are asked to take revenge on Pakistan, then everyone will agree, but when questioned that it can result in a nuclear war, which will give families for years If it is harmed, no one will ask for war

 At the same time, now the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha has made Congress and RJD restless by demanding more than half the seats

 In such a situation, no seat is found on the left

 jabaki, congress chah siten maang rahi he, jinamenhatiya, vishrampur, madhupur, ghatshila,bermour gandeya siten shaamil he
 The Congress wants to field its big tribal leaders, seeking reserved seats for the tribals

 JMM managed to win 11 seats out of the 28 reserved tribal seats in the 2014 elections

 'upi kaa haal bhi kuch alag nahinuttar pradesh kaa haal bhi kuch behatar nahin hai
 According to the state agriculture department, every year more than 10,000 farmers complain of crop damage from the Nilgai
 van vibhaag ke mutabik, pradesh main nilgayon kaa sabase zyada prakope lalitpur main he
 The departmental cattle census states that there are more than fourteen thousand and fourteen Nilgai in this area of bundelkhand

 Negi says, 'nilgai is mostly found in areas that are far from forested areas
 inaki jansankhya teji se badhati he isliye ye kisi bhi ilaake main kheti ke saamne chunauti ban jaati hai
 'around 2 in the whole state
 33 lakh nilgai hai jo van vibhaag or kisaanon ke liye sirdard bani hui hai
 Ratlam, Neemuch and Mandsaur districts of Madhya Pradesh, which took the first step in curbing Nilgai's infestation, are greatly affected by their terror
 yahaan ke kisaan kanvar laal bataate hai, 'nilgayon ke jhund saikadon acre fasal kharaab karke chale jate hai
 "there is no government restriction on killing this animal now," says a spokesperson of the state government, which gives relief to farmers by making Nilgai a rosary
 ' ab rajasthan kaa van vibhaag bhi nilgai ko maarane ke adhikaar sarpanchon ko dene ja rahaa he
 The long struggle of the peasants The sporadic efforts of the peasants against the Terrorism of the Nayugas had been going on for a long time all over the country
 lekin sangathit rup se aise prayaas bihar ke champaran main shuru hue
 In 2007, farmers organized for the first time under the banner of the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti and organized a sit-in demonstration
 2010 main hoicourt main daayar hui yachika2010 main samiti ke adhyaksh haridayal kushvaha ne patna hycourt main janhit yachika daayar kii
 On this, the court remarked that 'the damage from the Nilgaias is so extensive that the poor farmers are becoming more poor
 ' july 2011 main bihar ke van or paryaavaran mantralay ko court ne aadesh diya ki vah teen maah ke bheetar kisaanon kii samasya kaa hal nikaale
 In view of the High Court order, the state government ordered limited hunting of Nilgai in April 2012
 lekin iske liye pehle jiladhikari yaa esadm se likhit anumati leni hoti thi or nilgai ke shav kaa antim sanskaar anivaary tha
 So the farmers continued the agitation and finally in late 2015 the central government ended the ban on killing Nilgai and wild boars in the affected areas
 sarkaar ne yah praavdhaan ek varsh ke liye kiya he
 Earlier, they had to face legal action to kill without orders
 maarane kaa mila permitutar pradesh main nilgayon se kisaanon ko bachaane ke liye bada prayaas march, 2013 main hua jab rajya sarkaar ne nilgayon ko maarane kaa permit dene ke liye jiladhikari kii adhyakshata main ek paanch sadasyeey team bana di
 In this, Nilgaias were allowed to be killed up to 70 percent of their total population in any district
 haalanki yah yojana bhi asar nahin dikhaa saki
 a Wildlife Conservator of the Forest Department says that since 2013, not even 100 Nilgai have been killed in the entire state
 isamen 'vanya jeev (sangrakshan) adhinium-1972' hi aade aa rahaa he
 Section 39 of this Act provides that after killing Nilgai, the body of the forest department will have the right over its body
 purvanchal ke ek jila pashudhan adhikari manoj singh bataate hai, 'vadh ke baad nilgai ke shav par adhikaar na hone se log sarkaar kii is yojana main jaraa bhi ruchi nahin dikhaa rahe
 This is the reason that the outbreak of Nilgai is continuously increasing
 'nilgayon ko upi main bhi padosi rajya madhya pradesh kii tarj par shedul paanch kaa jaanavar ghoshit karne kii kavayad chal rahi he
 By entering this category, the Nilgai will become spoilage animals in the category of bats and rats

 aisa karne par inaki badhati aabaadi par to ankush lagata hi, baaghon ko unka swaabhaavik bhojan bhi mil jaataa or paristhitiki santulan bhi bana rahata

 Pabla says that before the new order of the central government, states had strange rules about killing Nilgai
 masalan, madhya pradesh main nilgai ko usee khet main maarane kii ijaajat thi jis khet ko usne chaupat kiya ho
 Its number in India in 2001 was one million

 In Nilgai-affected states, farmers also get compensation for the damage done to crops
 lekin muaavja lene kii behad jatil prakriya or muaavje kii raashi ke behad maamuli hone kii vajah se kisaan iske liye daawa hi nahin karte the
 Congress MLA from Madhya Pradesh Sundarlal Tiwari says, "rules for taking compensation are impractical

 Ranbir Kapoor is said to be a strong actor for the first Sanjay role
 duusari- nirmaan-nirdesan main rajkumaar hiraani or vidhu vinod chopra kii jodi
 The reason for the third and most important discussion is Sanjay Dutt himself

 The film stars Ranbir Kapoor in the lead role of Sanjay Dutt
 film nirmaan se jude sabhi log sanju ke liye ranbir ke jazbe kii jamkar taareef bhi kar rahe hai
 However, more than expected viewers do not want to see "sanju" for Ranbir Kapoor
 ranbir kii vajah se "sanju" dekhne waalon kii sankhya behad kam he
 "aaj Tak Movie Masala" posted a poll on its social page
 isamen logon kii raay jaani gai ki aakhir koi "sanju" kisalie dekhnaa chahta he? hamen jo jawaab mili uske aadhaar par yah laga ki asal main rajkumaar kii film "sanju" ke asal hero - "sanjay dutt" hi hai

 His look in Sanju is also seen testifying to this
 lekin hamane jo sawaal kiya tha usamen mahaj 23% pratishat log aise mili jo ranbir kii vajah se sanju dekhnaa chaahate hai
 While the habit of watching the new film was 19% of Sanju

 aap vidhayakon ko aaj ayog ko samajhaana hoga ki aakhir kaise unki sansadeey sachiv ke pad hui niyukti laabh ke pad ke daayre main nahin aati or kyon unki vidhayaki radd na kii jaae
 However, the difficulties of AAP legislators have already increased as the President has already returned the bill through which the Delhi government was trying to lift the post of 21 parliamentary secretary out of the purview of profit
 lekin ab chunaav ayog ko tay karnaa he ki yah 21 vidhayak laabh ke pad par hai yaa nahin
 The matter was heard twice in which the Congress, BJP and the Delhi government told the Commission why they should be made a party in this matter
 lekin ayog ne in teenon kii maang ko khaarij kar diya jisase ab yachikakarta or 21 vidhayak aamane-saamne honge
 AAP mlas will have to explain to the Commission today how their appointment to the post of Parliamentary Secretary does not come under the purview of the post of profit and why their legislature should not be canceled

 aaj kaashi main holi thi, mathura main or braj main bhi or aapke gaanv or shahar main bhi
 But you do not know whether it is Holi at all Sufi shrines of the country
 upi ke barabanki zile main sufi faqir haji vaaris ali shah kii dargah par holi main ham bhi shaamil hue
 No one knows the exact time when Holi happens here
 lekin isamen shirkat karne mulk ke tamaam hisson se tamaam mazahabon ke log aate hai
 Haji Waris Ali Shah is believed to be related to the family of Prophet Mohammad
 chamakate hue safed rang kii dargah ke angan main har taraf rang ud rahe the, laal, pile, hare, gulabi or sufi faqir un rangon main range hue the
 It plays Holi with dry colors
 dargah ke chaaron taraf raqs karte hue gulaal udaate hai
 Sufi Faqir Gani Shah Warsi, who lives at the dargah, says, "the government decreed that every religion is one in love
 unheen sarkaar ne hi yahaan holi khilne kii ravaayat shuru kii thi
 Sarkar himself used to play Holi and his hundreds of Murid whose religion was different, whose tongues parted, they used to come here to play Holi with them
 " Colors have no religion
 sadiyon se rangon kii kashish har kisi ko apni taraf khinchati rahi he
 Wajid Ali Shah, Zillailahi Akbar and Jahangir play all the references of playing Holi on the date
 nawab asafuddaula dasvin muharram ko tazia dafan kar lakhanu main talkatoraa kii karbala se waapas aa rahe the, ittefaaq se usee din holi thi or chowk main riyaaya rang khel rahi thi
 When the people grew with color towards the emperor, they also played the color on the day of Muharram so that Riya would not get the misconception that the Nawab's religion is different, so he is not playing the color
 waajid ali shah khud holi khelte the or holi ke din mahal sajaayaa jaataa tha
 All the paintings of the Mughal era are still present, in which the Mughal Emperor is shown playing Holi
 akbar ke jodhabai ke saath holi khilne kaa zikr miltaa he
 It is said that Jahangir used to play Holi with Nur Jahan, which was called "eid-e-pink"
 yah holi gulaal or gulab se kheli jaati
 And Bahadur Shah Zafar's Kalam is sung even today, "why mope rang ki mari pichkari, Dekho kunwar ji dungi main gari
 " Today we met Sardar SN Singh at the shrine of Haji Waris Ali Shah
 vah dilli se yahaan holi khilne aae the
 He is such a fan of Baba that he has started writing his name SN Singh Warsi
 vah bataate hai ki vah pehle kabhi holi nahin khelte the, lekin jab se baba kii mazaar kii holi dekhi, har saal yahaan holi khilne aate hai
 In fact, the heart of the Sufis was so big that it would merge into it
 holi kii ek samrudh parampara unke kalmon main milti he
 Bulleh Shah writes, "hori khelungi kah-kah bismillah, drop-in inallah
 " ise tamaam shastreey gayakon ne gaaya he
 The pen of Sufi Shah Niaz has been written by Abida Parveen, whose Holi mentions Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet Mohammad, and his daughters Hassan and Hussain
 vah likhte hai, "holi hoy rahi he ahamed jeeyo ke dwaar, hazaraat ali kaa rang bano he, hasan-hossain khild"
 And Khusro is still sung, "khelungi Holi Khwaja Ghar Aaye" or "tora Rang Man Bhayo Moiuddin

 The efforts of the government and Anna Hazare's side to draw a consensus common draft of the Lokpal Bill proved a failure on Tuesday
 sanyukt masauda samiti kii antim baithak ke baad gandhivadi hazaare ne elaan kiya ki vah sarkaar ko sabak sikhaane ke liye 16 agast se phir anshan karenge
 Even after nine meetings of the drafting committee in two months, the basic issues between the two sides could not be reached
 sarkaar ne jor diya ki vah aisi samanaantar sarkaar banane nahin de sakati jo kisi ke prati bhi javabdeh nahin ho
 There is no mention in the government's draft of bringing the conduct of the Prime Minister, the High Judiciary and the mps within Parliament within the ambit of Lokpal
 baharhaal, sarkaar ke masaude main lokapal ko ardh-nyaayik darja dene, sampatti kurk kaa adhikaar dene, swatantra tareeke se abhiyojan chalaane or police jaise purna adhikaron ke saath jaanch mashinari dene ke praavdhaanon kaa ullekh he
 Moily said the government draft provided that the ombudsman would have powers to recommend disciplinary action against bureaucrats, transfer them or suspend them until the investigation is pending
 sarkaar or hazaare paksh ke bich jin chah muddon par gambhir matbhed hai, ve hai pradhanmantri, ucch nyaaypalika or sansad ke andar saansadon ke bhrasht aacharan ko is swatantra jaanch nikaay ke daayre main rakhana, lokapal ko apana bajet tay karne ke adhikaar dena, sibiai kii bhrashtachar nirodhak shakha ko lokapal main shaamil karnaa or ek hi kanoon ke jariye centre main lokapal ke saath hi rajyon main lokayukta kii sthapana karnaa
 Apart from these six issues, differences emerged between the two sides on two new issues in the process of selection and removal of Lokpal in tomorrow's meeting
 hazaare paksh kaa janalokapal vidheyak kahata he ki lokapal puri tarah swatantra ho or sarkaar ke adheen bilkul bhi nahin ho
 The Hazare side has stated in its draft provisions to bring the conduct of mps within the Prime Minister, High Judiciary and Parliament within the purview of Lokpal
 samaaj ke sadasyon ke masaude main kaha gaya he ki pradhanmantri or ucch nyaaypalika ke nyaayadhishon ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kii shikaayat par pehle saat sadasyon kii ek peeth gaur karegi or shikaayat ko uchit paye jane par hi jaanch kii sifarish karegi
 The Hazare side says that the Lokpal should have complete financial autonomy
 sarkaar kaa daawa he ki hazaare paksh ne apane masaude main lokapal ko sakal gharelu utpaada kaa ek fisadi bajet aavantit karne ke praavdhaan kaa zikr kiya he
 The government draft says that the Lokpal will listen to any bureaucrat on his complaint first upon receiving a complaint of corruption and then start a preliminary inquiry
 hazaare paksh is praavdhaan ke khilaaf he
 The draft Hazare side says that a scrutiny committee of five judges should name the selection committee for the post of Lokpal chief and in the selection committee the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, two judges of the Supreme Court, two Chief Justices of the High Courts, Chief Election Commissioner And the Comptroller and Auditor General be retained
 samaaj ke sadasyon ke janalokapal vidheyak ke anusaar, sibiai kii bhrashtachar nirodhak shakha ko lokapal main shaamil kar liya jaye or lokapal ko sanyukt sachiv str ke adhinsth naukarshahon ke bhrashtachar kii bhi jaanch karne ke adhikaar die jaaen

 Whenever there is better work in Delhi, they get a new inquiry
 aam aadmi party kii sarkaar acha kaam naa kar sake iske liye apane tote ko laga dete hai
 These parrots should understand that in 2019 their owner will change and then these people will be in jail

 At the same time, Raghav Chadha said that Modi has not yet been able to digest the defeat of Delhi

" jain sarkari aspataalon ko acha karne ja rahe the, jisase nijee aspataalon kii lobby ko dikkat hui he
 PM Modi tells how many hospitals his BJP leaders have? If the case is old, then why did CBI Raid happen today? Satyendra Jain is the Health Minister, then the health mafia has lost sleep

 alok singh ke mutabik dilli kaa badhate pradooshan ne unke bachche kii sehat par bhi asar daalaa he
 This is the reason why Alok is always concerned about his child's health
 yakeenan kisi bhi maa-baap ke liye apni bacchon se badhkar koi khushi nahin hoti
 But if this child is born in Delhi, then pollution starts on him from day one
 paryaavaran ke khatarnaak nattijeyye ham nahin kah rahe, balki unicef kii ek report kahati he
 The recent UNICEF report made shocking revelations about the impact of pollution on children
 report ke anusaar vaayu pradooshan bacchon kii shaareerik sehat ko hi nahin, balki maansik sehat ko bhi prabhavit karata he
 The damage to the brain of children due to pollution is so big and deep that its effect lasts for a long time
 pradooshit hawa nahin hone detii dimag ko viksitadrasal, pradooshit hawa main maujuud ultra fine particals itane chote hote hai ki yah khun main aasaani se samaa jate hai or dimag main jahrile kanon se raksha karne vaale blad brain barier par hamalaa karne lagate hai
 According to the UNICEF report, if ultra fine magnetite reaches the body, oxidative stress can occur, which later leads to neurodegenerative diseases
 policyclic eromatic hydrocarbon dimag ke un hisson ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai, jo neurons ko communicket karne main madad karata he, saath hi dimag ke us hisse ko bhi prabhavit karata he, jiske jariye baccha sikhta he or viksit hota he
 More impact on children between 1 and 5 years old, from the time the child is born till the age of five, its immune system and lungs are in the process of developing
 lihaaja is umr main baccha jab saans letaa he to us vakt wo apane sharir ke vajan ke mutabik bado kii tulana main zyada saans letaa he
 If the child is taking this breath in polluted air, which is polluted on most occasions in Delhi, then the chemicals in the air directly attack his brain
 pradooshit hawa main koun se rasayan maujuudchaliye aapako ye bhi bataa dete hai ki vaayu pradooshan main koun-koun se jahrile rasayan maujuud hote hai
 How do these chemicals affect children's health
 pradooshan main teen tarah ke particals yani kan hote hai
 First Ultra Fine Pollution Particles, Second Ultra Fine Magnetite and Third Polycyclic Aromatic Hydro Carbons
 beete dinon jab polution kaa level badha hua tha, tab inhen teenon particals ne aapke bacchon par atake kiya or jab pradooshan main maujuud ye jahrile kan atake karte hai to uskaa parinaam behad kharaab hota he
 PM 2
 5 kaise karata he apana kambal rog visheshgy dow ravi malik ke mutabik PM 2
 5 Like the particles of pollution are so small and fine that they reach inside the body of children through air
 sharir main pahunchane ke baad ye khun se hote hue brain tak pahunch jate hai, jahaan se ye blad brain barier par atake karte hai
 The child's brain has a thin membrane, which protects the brain from toxic substances
 dilli kii hawa beete kai varshon se khaastaur par sardiyon ke vakt sabase zyada pradooshit hoti he
 Hence, children born and living in Delhi have the biggest attack of pollution on their minds
 pradooshan ke kaaran bacchon ko hoti he ye pareshanichild neurologist doctor praveen kumaar ne ajtak ko bataaya kii lagaataar pradooshan ke sampark main rahane kii vajah se bacchon ke badhate brain par sidhaa asar ho rahaa he
 Because of this, the child's ability to understand learning, concentration and memory is being affected
 pradooshan ke kan jaise lead, sulfur, nitras oxide, ozon ye sabhi brain ko protect karne vaale blad barier membrane ko nuksaan pahuchaate hai
 90 percent of the brain development of children takes place by the age of 2 years
 lekin baaki 10 pratishat dimag 10 se 12 kii umr tak viksit hota rahata he, jo ki pradooshan ke sampark kii vajah se bacchon main aage memory problem, les aikyuu jaisi kamiyon kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 According to the UNICEF report, the particles of pollution are constantly damaging the brain's white matter, which helps children understand learning
 iske alaava ye samasya urban yaa metro ariaj main sabhi jagah se zyada he
 It can be guessed that our environment is responsible for this
 beete november dilli main puure saat din yani 7 november se lekar 13 november ke bich piem 2
 Both 5 and PM 10 were in the sevier category and air pollution remains in the very Poor category at the present time i
e
 the entire early week of December
 sidhe lafjon main kahen to is dauraan jahrili hawa ne bacchon ke dimag par sabase zyada atake kiya
 Overall, it can be said that if there is no treatment of polluted winds in time, then the children who breathe in these poisonous winds will neither be able to become scientists nor can they brighten the name of India in the world of sports

 Australia's all-rounder Shane Watson has no qualms about being dropped
 bharat ke saath vanade siries ke liye nazarandaaj hone ke baad bhi vah pareshaan nahin hai
 The 34-year-old Watson has currently focused his attention in the Big Bash League, but is scared in his mind
 watson ne pichley saal test cricket ko alavida kah diya
 Watson decided to retire after coach Darren Lehmann dropped him from the team after a poor performance in the first Test of the Ashes series last year
 watson ne 59 test main 3731 ran banane ke baad sanyas liya
 According to the Australian media, Watson has given up hope of a comeback and is focusing on the Big Bash League

" main ab bhi khel saktaa hum, lekin ab chayankarton ke haath main he ki wo mujhe chunate hai yaa nahin

 australia ke liye 49 tii-20 khel chuke watson ne lig ke 6 maichon main sirf 94 ran banaae hai, jisamen ek bhi ardhshtak shaamil nahin he
 Even in bowling, he has not done anything amazing
 in 6 maichon main unke naam 5 wicket hai

 i have a lot of cricket left in me and i can come back, which will be for good

 During this time he has been questioned many times, but he has answered with his performance
 tippaniyan Watson says that after taking out of both formats of cricket, Test and ODI, he is worried

 Watson, who has played 49 T20s for Australia, has scored just 94 runs in 6 matches of the league, not including a single half-century

 big bos 13 ne tiarapy ke maamle main itihaas rach diya he
 Season 13 has proved to be the most successful season in the show's history
 sho ko lekar darshakon main utsaah saaf taur par dikhaai de rahaa he
 Although initially Bigg Boss was not doing very well in terms of trps, the interesting twists and turns brought by the makers on the show, high-voltage dramas between contestants, skirmishes and sour sweet noises made the show a hit
 Have given
 sho kii badhati tiarapy or demand ko dekhte hue mekars ne sijan 13 ko ekstand kar diya he
 Now the grand show of Bigg Boss will not run till January but till February
 lekin big bos ke ekstansion se ek or jahaan phans khush hai vahiin duusari or darshakon ke man main ek sawaal ye bhi he ki aakhir sho ko ekstand karnaa kitna sahi he or kya ekstansion ke baad sho kii tiarapy main badhotaree hogi yaa phir mekars kii ummiido par pani phir jayega? ham aapako un pahaluon ke bare main bataate hai jo sho ko ekstansion ke baad flop kar sakati hai?salmaan khan kaa sho main naa hona-bollywood ke dabang yanisalman khanbig bos kii jaan hai
 Bigg Boss is known nationwide by Salman Khan's face
 salmaan khan kii badi fain folowing sho kii tiarapy badhaane main ahm role play karti he
 But there are reports that Salman Khan will probably not host the show after the event
 salmaan khan ke big bos ko host naa karne kii khabaren saamne aate hi soshal media par phans kaaphi niraash hai
 Many fans of Salman Khan on social media said that if Salman Khan does not host the show, then he will stop watching the show
 ab ye to tay he ki agar big bos ke ekstansion ke baad salmaan khan sho chhodte hai to iskaa sidhaa asar sho kii tarapy par pad saktaa he
 Fatigue and Low energy-big Boss in Celebs is a house where contestants live in different houses in the same house away from the outside world
 lambey samay tak apano se dur rahanaa or rojaanaa vivaadon or ladaai-jhagade vaale vaataavaran main rahane se contestants kaaphi chidchide ho jate hai
 At the same time, the energy of the contestants also starts going down
 sijan 13 main shuruyaat se hi contestants ke bich dhamaakedaar drama or ladaaiyaan dekhne ko mil rahi hai
 Now the question arises here that the audience in the show can be bored seeing the same type of drama, fighting and fights for a long time
 zyada lambey samay tak ghar main rahane se contestants kii energy bhi down hone se sho kii tiarapy par fark pad saktaa he
 Farah Khan - There are reports that Farah Khan may replace Salman Khan after the expansion of Bigg Boss
 aisa pehali baar nahin he ki jab salmaan khan kii jagah farah khan kaa naam saamne aa rahaa he
 Farah Khan also replaced Salman Khan in season 8 before Bigg Boss season 13
 farah khan ne sho ko kaaphi acchhee tarah host kiya tha
 Despite this, the TRP of its show had fallen considerably
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki kya is baar bhi sho ke ekstansion ke baad tiarapy girti he yaa badhati he

 (iput bhashaa se) There is no dearth of admirers of politicians, cricketers and cine artists across the world, but there is a man in Jalandhar who is a big fan of bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi

 This Modi devotee has also vowed not to shave off his beard until he becomes Prime Minister, Arun Khurana, a resident of Kaki village in Jalandhar district, is such a great devotee of Modi that he worships Modi everyday and has been celebrating his birthday continuously for seven years

 Heard 60 thousand times for the same song of the emperor Pankaj Udhas 60 thousand times to listen to Khurana, who has registered his name in the Limca Book of Records, says that the people of the village have been engaged in devotion to Modi ever since Not only in Jalandhar, people did not know much about Modi in Punjab
 khurana kehete hai, 2007 main modi jab phir se gujarat ke mukhyamantri bane tab maine ek unka ek board banavaakar jalandhar ke ramamandi chowk par taang diya tha
 It was written on it, 'future PM of India'
 logon ne mujhe kaha ki main pagal ho gaya hum, par modi ke bare main meri raay ab tak nahin badali he
 i think the whole situation will become clear on 16 May
 bread banane kaa kaam karne vaale khurana ne kaha, ' achaanak mere antarman main yah baat ai or maine kaha ki modi pradhanmantri banenge
 After that i transformed my office into a temple of Modi

 ' apni lambii dadhi ke bare main poochne par 39 saal ke khurana kehete he, maine shapath lee he ki modi jab tak pradhanmantri nahin banenge tab tak apni dadhi nahin kataaunga
 He pledged this on the occasion of Modi's birthday in 2012
 khun se likhaa tha modi ko khatyah poochne par ki kabhi modi se mili hai to khurana kehete hai, kai baar- haryana, himachal or punjab main
 Last year, when Modi came to Madhopur (punjab) on the Martyrdom Day of Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, i met him
 saat pannon main apane khun se likhaa patr diya tha
 Modi said that stop writing work with blood
 aapaki dadhi 2014 main cat jaaegi iskaa mujhe puraa yakeen he
 There is a TV in the temple office of Khurana, on which Modi's speech goes on continuously from every morning till the office is closed at night
 unke paas modi ke 30-35 bhaashanon kaa collection he
 He goes on continuously
 parivaar ke logon ko dikkat nahin hoti he, is par khurana kehete hai, sabko dikkat aati he
 Parent child

 The Rajasthan Legislative Assembly has passed the 5 percent Gujjar reservation bill for the third time
 pichhadaa varg aarakshan bill 2019 ko buudhvaar hi vidhansabha main pesh kiya gaya or aaj hi paarit kar diya gaya
 This bill states that Gujjars are given 5 per cent reservation
 iske saath hi yah bhi gurjaron se apil kii gai ki vah railway trek or haive chhod kar uth jaaen
 His demand has been passed as an MLA in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly
 haalanki abhi faisla nahin hua he ki gurjar is baat par raji hokar railway trek or haive se uth jaaenge, kyonki pehali baar mukhyamantri ke rup main ashok gahalot ne 2015 main gurjaron ko 5 fisadi aarakshan diya tha, jis par hai court ne roak laga di thi
 After that the Vasundhara government came and in 2017, the Gurjars were given reservation
 us par bhi rajasthan hai court ne roak laga di
 The Rajasthan government has gone to the Supreme Court against this and a hearing is going on there
 hamaari sarkaar kaa yah drudh vishwaas he ki samaaj ke har tabake- khaastaur par nirdhan, asahaay or pichde varg ko aarthik rup se shashakt banaakar hi ham apane pradesh ko garibi or berogari ke abhishaap se mukt kar sakate hai

 com / k60t7wveyl— Ashok Gehlot (@ashokgehlot51)february 13, 201950 se zyada fisadi tak aarakshan nahinis bich 2018 main congress kii sarkaar phir se aa gai or gurjar phir se aarakshan kii maang ko lekar patari par baith gaye
 Ashok Gehlot found out the same method of solution and once again got the assembly passed in 2019 to give reservation to Gurjars
 rajasthan vidhansabha main gurjaron kaa aarakshan vidheyak paarit to hota he, lekin har baar atak jaataa he
 The court says that the total reservation limit cannot be more than 50, so the Gujjars cannot be given reservation
 rajasthan main abhi tak 49 fisadirajasthan main pehle se essi, asti or obisi ke aarakshan ko milakar 49 fisadi he
 The remaining one percent reservation is being given to the Gurjars
 teesri baar paarit hone se gurjaron ko aarakshan kaa laabh mil paaegaa
 On this, the BJP expressed apprehension that everyone was ready in the assembly, but nothing will happen from it
 congress ne kii modi sarkaar se samvidhan sanshodhan kii apilpratipaksh ke netaa gulabchand kataaria ne kaha ki pichley kai saalon se hota aa rahaa he, lekin jab tak samvidhan sanshodhan nahin hoga, tab tak gurjaron ko aarakshan nahin mil saktaa he
 Responding to this, Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot said that the BJP should get the Constitution amendment done by the Modi government at the Center
 jis tarah se garibon ko bhi aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan karaayaa gaya he
 In the same way, to give reservation to Gurjars, get the Constitution amended at the Center

 Tik Tok se bain hataa liya gaya he, lekin ab bhi ye ap google play store or aipal ap store par uplabdh nahin he
 This app was banned from Google Play Store and Apple's App Store for a week
 haalanki is ap ko ab bhi downlod kar sakate hai
 For this, you have to resort to third party website
 madras hai court ne Tik Tok se bain to hataaya he, lekin shart bhi rakhi he
 The court has said that such content should not be uploaded on this platform which is related to pornography and in such a situation, the app will have to take action within 36 hours
 agar ap aisa nahin kiya to contempt of court kii proceding shuru kii jaaegi
 One of the arguments made by the company in the court arguments was that Tik Tok has such technology available which ensures that no nude or observant contents are uploaded on this app
 itnaa hi nahin company ne kaha he ki 60 lakh se zyada videos ko isliye hataaya gaya he ki kyonki wo policy kaa ulanghan kar rahe the
 Tik Tok First Music
 ly ke naam se popular tha baad main yah tik tok bana
 Significantly, in the US too, this app was charged with collecting personal information of children illegally
 haalanki is ap ne america fedral trade kamishan yani FTC ke saath is maamle ko settle karne ke liye 5
 Had agreed to give $ 7 million
 duniya bhar main Tik Tok ke paas 500 million manthali active yugers hai
 But it is also a fact that this app is the largest market in India and there are more than 120 million monthly active users of this app
 yahi vajah he ki ap bain hone ke baad har din tik tok ko 5 lakh dollar kaa nuksaan ho rahaa tha
 It is possible that the company is working on a new policy to prevent future ban
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki yah ab ab tak google play store or aipal ap store par nahin aayaa he
 Although the company expressed happiness in a statement given by the court after the ban was lifted and said that soon the app will be available for download, but no timeline has been given for it

 The BJP has also fielded Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Karnataka election campaign
 aaj piem modi karnataka main chaar chunavi reliyaan kar rahe hai

 The Congress wants to rule by dividing by caste, religion, sect and region
 unhone kaha kicongresspana hisaab tak nahin dena chaahati he
 Congress is lying
 unhone logon se kaha ki agar congress vot maangane aae, to poochna kii sand mafiaon ko sangrakshan dene vaale koun hai
 There is no difference between Congress's c and Corruption's c now

 Under this rule, cattle can no longer be sold to butchers' hands or for harvesting at weekly fairs or mandis for cattle
 isamen gaay, bhens, bachhda, oont shaamil hai
 The new rule does not say that there is a complete ban on the biting of cows or buffaloes, but that it is said to stop buying directly from fairs or mandis
 punjab kii dabwaali pashu mandi main ravivaar ke din kareeb pachaas hajaar maveshi laae jate hai
 Here buffaloes are sold by butchers, not cows
 hamane yahaan ke deyari kisaan darshan singh se baat kii
 Darshan Singh told me to write the headline that the decision is right but the government should open buffalo school like a cowshed, get the grazing land of the cows from the clutches of the mafia, then the cow or buffalo will not be seen roaming on the road
 vaise aapako lagata he ki sarkaar bhens shaala kholegi? baharhaal, darshan singh ne bataaya ki nae niyam se maweshiyon kii kataai par puri tarah roak nahin lagi he magar mandi main kasaai ko bechney par roak laga dene se kasaai ke liye khareednaa mushkil ho jayega
 Previously he could buy twenty-five buffaloes in one day, but now he will have to roam from house to house and it will take two months
 vyapaaree bhi yahi kah rahe hai ki sidhaa kisaanon se maance vyapaar ke liye khareednaa mushkil ho jayega
 Buffalo should be excluded from the new rule because India exports beef to 65 countries
 is chakra main lakhon log asthaayee kism kaa rojgaar pate hai
 Livestock and farmers also get better prices for their animals in the mandis
 vah molbhav kar paata he
 If he is not able to sell then he will have to keep the unfit buffalo in his house or leave it like a cow in the open
 is masale se jude vivaad kaa sambandh jitna krurta ko rokna nahin he usase kahin zyada iske jariye gaay or gau maance kii raajnneeti ko jinda rakhana lagata he
 In this, the activism of every side is commendable

 The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has issued notification on 23 May 2017 by issuing notification

 But you know, we have ghungroo, bells, colorful strips
 melon main iskaa vyapak bazaar hota he

 bharat main gop ashtami ke din gaay ko ghunghru pahanaai jaati he
 The horn is dyed
 gaay ko rangate bhi hai
 It is believed that by applying mustard oil in cow horn, the effect of Saturn is reduced
 kya yah sab bhi ab pratibandhit ho jayega or kisaan aasaani se sweekaar kar lenge
 The central government says that all these rules have been made in line with the Supreme Court's guidelines
 ek sawaal he ki inhen lagu koun karegaa, jurmaana or jail kaa khel shuru hoga gaanv-gaanv main
 It is written that apart from the vet, no other person can feed any liquids to the cattle

 In my childhood, i used to give digestive medicine to the cow with a bamboo tube called Kandi in the local language

 In West UP, it is called a placenta, which gives oil to new buffalo, ghee is fed to the bull

 The comments notification main krurta kii sajaa nahin he, lekin jis privansion aaf kruyelity tu animals act se yah notification niklaa he uske anusaar teen maheene kii jail ho sakati he
 The fine is fine, ranging from ten rupees to 100 rupees only
 yah bhi bataanaa chahie tha ki nalabandi ke liye maveshi ko jameen par giraate vakt kis tarah kii shaiyya yani bistar yani gadde kaa istemaal karnaa hoga
 Now come to beef politics
 shanivaar ko kerala main youth congress kii karatuut ko bijepi ne desh bhar main vyapak mudda bana diya he
 Now listen to the reaction of Meghalaya BJP leaders on beef and beef
 yah zarur he ki unhone public main bachade ko katkar virodh kaa ghinauna kaam nahin kiya he
 Meghalaya BJP leader Bernard Marak has said that if these rules are implemented, he will leave the BJP
 agar yah niyam nahin badla to hamaare liye aagaamee chunaavon main bijepi ke liye prachaar karnaa mushkil ho jayega
 They say that we cannot go against the food and drink behavior of our state
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki meghalaya main bijepi ke netaa bif khate hai
 In March, the Nagaland BJP chief told Hindustan Times that if our party comes to power in Nagaland, there will not be a ban on cow slaughter here like in UP
 yah baat hamaare centre ke netaaon ko maaloom bhi he
 The BJP is a partner in Nagaland's government
 mizoram ke bijepi adhyaksh ne bhi kaha tha ki gaay kaatane par mizoram main koi bain nahin hoga
 Goa also has the same condition
 to bijepi ko bhi saaf-saaf kahana chahie ki kya vah puure desh main gau maance par pratibandh lagane ke paksh main he, or iske liye kya karne ja rahi he
 Before doing this, he has to tell what is the employment option of millions of people associated with it, what will happen to them
 gaanvon main kisaanon par kya asar padegaa

 No person will tie a calf, it will not sneeze
 tippaniyan There is no punishment of cruelty in the notification, but according to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, this notification has been sentenced to three months in jail
 jurmaana thik he, das rupee se lekar 100 rupee tak hi he
 It should also have been told what kind of bed, a mattress would have to be used while felling the cattle on the ground for falsification
 ab aate hai bif politics par
 The BJP has made a widespread issue across the country on Saturday in the Youth Congress
 ab meghalaya ke bijepi netaaon kii bif or gau maance par pratikriya sun lijie
 It is definitely that he has not done the disgusting act of protest by cutting the calf in public
 meghalaya bijepi ke netaa barnard mara ne kaha he ki agar yah niyam lagu kiye gaye to ve bijepi chhod denge
 If this rule does not change then it will be difficult for us to campaign for BJP in the upcoming elections
 unka kahana he ki ham apane rajya ke khan paan ke vyavhaar ke khilaaf nahin ja sakate hai
 He also said that BJP leaders in Meghalaya eat beef
 march main nagaland ke bijepi chif ne hindustan times se kaha tha ki agar nagaland main hamaari party satta main aati he to upi kii tarah yahaan gaay kaatane par bain nahin lagegaa
 The leaders of our center also know this
 nagaland kii sarkaar main bijepi bhagidaar he
 The BJP president of Mizoram had also said that there would be no ban in Mizoram for cow slaughter
 goa kii bhi yahi haalat he
 So the BJP should also clearly say whether it is in favor of banning beef meat across the country, and what it is going to do for it
 aisa karne se pehle use bataanaa hoga isse jude lakhon logon ke rojgaar kaa vikalp kya he, unka kya hoga
 What will be the impact on the farmers in the villages
 notification main krurta kii sajaa nahin he, lekin jis privansion aaf kruyelity tu animals act se yah notification niklaa he uske anusaar teen maheene kii jail ho sakati he
 The fine is fine, ranging from ten rupees to 100 rupees only

 ek nai kitaab kii maane to naaji taanashaah adolf hitler yon shakti badhaane ke liye viagara kaa prayog karata tha
 The closed documents in medical archives and some confidential military documents are the basis for this study
 kitaab main daawa kiya gaya he ki hitler 82 prakaar kii vibhinn dawaaon kaa seven karata tha jisamen ‘‘viagara’’ bhi shaamil thi
 This Viagra was a type of sat extracted from testosterone
 da daily telegraph samachaarpatr ne khabar di he ki kitaab ‘‘vaaj hitler il’’ main kaha gaya he ki hitler ko vishwaas tha ki yon shakti vardhak aushadhi usase umr main kaaphi choti premika eva brown ke saath sambandh banane main aavashyak urja pradaan karegi
 The writings in the book are based on the documents of Hitler's personal physician, Theodore Morel aka Reich Syringe
 kitaab main kaha gaya he ki morel ne varsh 1944 main hitler ko testosterone or bachade ke protest grathiyon ke shukranuon kaa enjaction dena shuru kar diya tha
 According to the news of the British Daily, Morel gave Hitler a few doses of Pervitin, glucose, injection of methamphetamine, barbiturate, and other ingredients besides opiate
 56 varsh kii aayu main marane vaale hitler kaa maananaa tha ki chote bachade ke shukranu or uski protest granthiyaan uski 33 varsh kii premika brown ke saath sambandh sthapit karne main yon shakti pradaan karata he
 In April 1945, Brown died as a new fledgling bride in a bunker in Berlin, eating a cyanide
 chikitsak ke abhilekhon ke anusaar hitler ke biimaar hone par vah apane swasthya ke prati kaaphi dar gaya or ek aisi avasthaa ai ki vah iske upachaar ke liye 28 vibhinn prakaar kii aushadhiyaan lene laga
 Heinrich Abrell, author of the book and Hannes Jaochim Neumann of Charit University University in Berlin, said they were trying to find out if Hitler's poor health was responsible for the decision to kill his millions

 He was not prone to delusions

 You may not have heard of changing the name of a train before today
 khaskar jab vah lambey samay se patari par daud rahi ho or train railmantri kii ahm ghoshnaa kaa hissaa ho, lekin adaalat ke aadesh ke baad amritsar−lalkuna express kaa naam ab garib rath express ho gaya he
 The story of changing the name of this train is very interesting
 darasal is train kii ghoshnaa 2013−14 ke rail bajet main pawan kumaar bansal ne kii thi
 Fully AC coach out of reach of common man
 isamen na sleeper bogi or na hi general bogi
 On October 2, 2013, this train was flagged off in a hurry

 It consisted of 13 coaches of three tier acs and 3 coaches of chaircars
 baaki bache do jenerator coach jisase bogiyon main power kii supplai hoti
 This AC Express railway started running on the track with the coaches of the poor chariot
 is train main saharsa garib rath kii bogiyon ko lagaaya gaya or kiraaya asi kaa vasula jane laga
 Whereas according to the rules of the railway itself, if the bogie belongs to the poor chariot, then the fare will be the same of the poor chariot
 yahaan railway public ko chuunaa lagaati rahi
 But Keshav Pasi of Uttarakhand understood the story and filed a case in the Nainital High Court
 is maamle main adaalat ne 10 june ko faisla sunaaya ki amritsar−lalkuna express kaa naam turant badalakar garib rath express kiya jaae or nateeja 11 june ko railway kii website ne is train kaa naam badal diya
 However, many questions still remain after this court order
 nayaa kiraaya to garib rath kaa hi hoga, lekin ab tak jin yatriyon se railway ne zyada paise vasule unka hisaab kaise hoga
 Will the railways pay them back? If not, what will happen to those money and if yes, then how will those passengers be searched

 ranking main sudhaar kar ke mudies ne na sirf modi sarkaar ke jiesti samet anya sudhaaron par muhar lagaai he, balki isse arthvyavastha kii raftaar bhi behatar rahane kii ummid jataai he
 This will not only bring back investor confidence in the Indian economy, but will also encourage the Modi government to make more major reforms like GST
 kya hoti he BAA2 reatincredit reating agencymoodies is reating ko long turm bonds ke saath kuch anya niveshon ko lekar jari karti he
 Whenever Moody's improves this rating of the country, it means that the risk in long-term bonds and other investments in that country is reduced
 bainkon ko BAA reating bonds main nivesh ke liye protsaahit kiya jaataa he
 The better the monthly rating for investment, the better will be the environment in the country to invest
 long turm bonds main nivesh kaa jokhim utana hi kam hoga
 BAA2 reflects moderate credit risk
 inhen medium grad ke taur par liya jaataa he
 This creates better investment opportunities in the economy
 nivesh aise yuj karte hai ranking komudiski is ranking se niveshkon ko long turm bonds ke nafe or nuksaan kaa anumaan lagane main madad milti he
 This helps him decide whether he wants to maintain his investment in long-term bonds and fixed income securities
 iske alaava reating ke behatar hone par vah nivesh badhaane par bhi vichaar karte hai
 Investments will increase in the country Global investors rely on Moody's rating
 aise main behatar retings kaa matlab he behatar nivesh
 Improving ratings increases the expectation of increased investment
 mudies reating sudharne se bharat main bhi videshi nivesh badhane kii ummid he
 Moody's has said that the economy will benefit from the ratings improvement
 gharelu niveshak bhi apana nivesh badha sakate hai
 Modi government will take tough decisions In the current time, Moody's has given a big relief to the Modi government, which is facing criticism for economic development and reforms like GST and demonetisation
 mudies ne jiesti jaise anya sudhaaron ko na sirf saraahaa he, balki inhen kaaphi asardaar qaraar diya he
 After getting better signals from Moody's, it will become easier for the Modi government to take even more stringent decisions

 Article 35A of the Constitution, implemented in 1954 under the order of the President under Article 370, has become a problem for the Central Government
 maamle main aresas se jude think tanks jammu-kashmir vichaar manch ne centre sarkaar par artikil 35e ko hameshaa ke liye khaarij karne kaa dabaav badha diya he
 Here the Supreme Court has fixed October 21 as the next date for hearing on the petition of 5 others including v The People and West Pak Refugee Action Committee-1947
 pehle sunwaayee kii taarikh 13 sitambar ke liye supreme court ne tay kii thi
 The central government meanwhile has to file an answer in the Supreme Court as well, what is the current constitutional status of Section 35A, passed in 1954, by constitutional order only without the approval of Parliament? The issue in the matter is also that why is it not mentioned in any newly published book of the constitution? Whereas, in the copies of the old constitution, section 35A is kept in the appendix itself
 kya he dhara 35e kaa maamla?samvidhan ke anuchhed 35e ko 14 may 1954 main raashtrapati ke aadesh se samvidhan main jagah mili thi
 In any proceedings of Parliament taking the Constituent Assembly, there is no reference to any constitution amendment or bill in the context of making Article 35A a part of the Constitution
 anuchhed 35e ko lagu karne ke liye tatkaaleen sarkaar ne dhara 370 ke antargat praapt shakti kaa istemaal kiya tha
 Article 35A gave the Jammu and Kashmir government and its legislative assembly an arbitrary right to decide the definition of permanent resident
 isi ke saath rajya sarkaar ko ye adhikaar bhi mila ki wo aazaadee ke vakt duusari jagahon se aae sharnaarthiyon or anya bhartiya nagarikon ko jammu-kashmir main kis tarah kii sahuliyatein de athwa nahin de
 Why the controversy over Section 35A? a large number of refugees from Pakistan came to India at the time of Partition
 inamen lakhon kii taadaad main sharnaarthi jammu-kashmir rajya main bhi rah rahe hai
 The Government of Jammu and Kashmir, through Article 35A, denied all these Indian citizens a permanent resident certificate of Jammu and Kashmir
 in vanchiton main 80 fisad log pichde or dalit hindu samudaay se sambandhit hai
 Simultaneously, the Jammu and Kashmir government discriminates against women and other Indian citizens who get married in Jammu and Kashmir under the guise of Article 35A
 supreme court main daakhil yachika main logon ne shikaayat kii he ki anuchhed 35e ke kaaran samvidhan pradutt unke mul adhikaar jammu-kashmir rajya main chin liye gaye hai, lihaaja raashtrapati ke aadesh se lagu is dhara ko centre sarkaar fouran radd kare
 What is the stand of the current Jammu and Kashmir government? Answer has been filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of the Jammu and Kashmir government
 jammu sarkaar ne supreme court main daawa kiya he ki 1954 main anuchhed 35e ke paarit hone ke baad pehali baar court main raashtrapati ke aadesh ko chunauti di gai he
 In this way the petition was delayed
 isi aadhaar par hi is yachika ko khaarij kar diya janaa chahie
 However, the issue raised in the petition has already been rejected by the Supreme Court in the case of Puranlal and Sampat Prakash, so now this petition has no meaning
 
 
 
 Article 35A is now a settled law, the state government and the Center have approved it
 kya he RSS kaa rukh?anuchhed 35e ko khatm karne ke liye aresas ke think tanks jammu-kashmir vichaar manch ne hi adaalat se lekar sadak tak taarkik or bauddhik ladaai ched rakhi he
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, J&K Convenor convenor Ashutosh Bhatnagar says that 'the central government will have to clean the stand on Article 35A today or not tomorrow, how long Article 35A without the approval of Parliament will be passed by the President's order There will be open discrimination due to millions of citizens
 jald saaf karenge apana rukhareses se jude ek anya kendriya netaa kaa kahana he ki hamane maamle main sarkaar se jude logon se baatcheet kii he or saaf kiya he ki samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke mutabik maamle main sarkaar ko stand lenaa chahie
 How long such discrimination will continue with millions of Indian citizens in Jammu and Kashmir
 centre sarkaar ne hamen aashwaasan diya he ki sarkaar jammu-kashmir main kisi bhi bhartiya naagarik ke saath bhedbhaav nahin hone degi or anuchhed 35e ko lekar 1954 ke raashtrapati ke aadesh kii bhi sarkaar gahan samiksha kar apana rukh jald adaalat ke saamne saaf karegi

 Atmaram Gupta, a councilor from Delhi, was killed
 laash bulandshahr jile main mili thi
 Then the post-mortem of Atmaram's corpse was taking place under the open sky outside the morgue of a government hospital there
 tab pehali baar ek sweepar ko postmortem karte dekha gaya tha
 Then i thought, what does the dead know about the sweeper or doctor? But think what will happen if the sweeper starts your operation instead of the doctor in the operation theater instead of the post mortem? But this is happening
 1596 marijon par keval ek doctor!hindustan kii aabaadi sava sau karod he
 The total number of doctors in India is 10 lakh 41 thousand 395
 yani 1596 mariz par ek doctor
 Here is the picture of the whole country
 rajyon kii haalat to or bhi buree he
 In Bihar, for example, there is a doctor on 28 thousand 391 patients
 ab zaahir he jab doctoron kii aisi or itani kami hogi to aspataal or oparation theatre kii tasviir bhi kuch aisi hi hogi
 Did the cleaning worker do the operation without a light? Have you seen any cleaning worker doing the operation? Can an operation theater be operated without light? Swiper became a surgeon in the absence of a doctor
 torch kii roshni main safaikarmi ne kii mahila ke haath kii surgery
 It can only happen in our own country
 ho saktaa kya ho rahaa he
 Gone rather
 doctor sahab nahin the, to aspataal kaa safai karmchaaree hi doctor ban gaya
 For years, he cleaned the hospital and operation theater so many times that he became a doctor after seeing bus doctors operating
 or phir mauka milte hi doctori ke saare harbe bhi aazamaa liye
 Neither waiting for the doctor, nor the worry of lightning, a woman was injured in the accident
 uske haathon main gahari chotein ai thim
 The family members rushed him to Sadar Hospital
 magar ittefaq se tab aspataal main doctor, nurse or bijli teenon gaayab or gul the
 The opportunity was great
 haath saaf karne or doctorl ke apane hunar ko aazamaane kaa
 So without losing any chance, this cleaning lady in the sweeper uniform wore gloves in her hands and started surgery
 naa doctor kaa intjaar kiya or naa hi bijli aane kaa
 Operation under flashlight Now if there was no electricity, then how would the operation be? So one of the four relatives of the injured woman on the spot caught the flashlight
 duusari ne mobile kii flash lite jalaai, teesri ne swipper se achaanak doctor ban gaye sahab kii madad ke liye ghayal mahila kaa haath pakadaa
 The fourth one left was to comfort his injured female relative
 oparation kii live ricardinpub ilaaj shuru hota he
 The severed part of the first hand is cleaned
 phir sui se taanka lagane kaa kaam shuru hota he
 And at the end of the stitch, tie the knot in the thread and cut it
 ye puraa oparation baqayada live ricard bhi ho rahaa tha
 But the sweeper did not care about it at all
 shaayad wo iskaa pehle aadi tha
 Because in between, he was often looking at the camera
 saharsa ke sadar aspataal kaa maamalaye bakya bihar ke saharsa kaa he
 More photos of Sadar Hospital in Saharsa
 khaaki vardi pahane oparation kar rahe in janaab kaa nanm shanbhu malik he or ye isi aspataal main safaai karmi ke taur par kaam karte hai
 Now, if a sanitation worker starts operation by becoming a doctor like this, then there is a question of the doctors of the hospital
 magar is bare main aspataal ke civil sarjan se baat karne kii koshish kii to wo ye kah kar kanni kaat gaye ki philhal wo patna main hai
 Now Bari had to ask the same question to the deputy superintendent of the hospital
 to unhone bhi topi kisi or ke sir par pahana di
 In Andhergardi's example, we were told that the Sadar Hospital is often electrified
 andhere main pehle bhi yahaan oparation hote rahe hai
 Now obviously when the operations are in the dark, then who is going to see that the doctors who are doing the operation are the swipers or anyone else? It is really dark

 unhone kaha ki is baat kaa pachhtaawaa he ki is captain kii ore se saal 2009 main test vaapasi ke sawaal kaa sakaaratmak jawaab nahin de sake
 This could have helped Nehra play more than 17 Test matches

 His best performance in the World T20 enabled him to make his selection in the 'team of Tournament'

 Captain dhoninehra remains cool under pressure, said that i have not seen any player who is so cool under pressure
 nehra ko sabase bada pachhtaawaa is baat kaa he ki vah 17 se zyada test match nahin khel paae
 The senior fast bowler said that Dhoni and then coach Gary Kirsten asked me in 2009 if i would like to return to the Test? Should have played more Test matches Nenehra said that i was 30 or 31 years old then and i should have given a positive answer But i was not sure
 do saal pehle kii baat he maine 35 saal kii umr main maine chah hafton main chah chaar divasiy match khele
 So when i look back, i feel that i should have played more than 17 Test matches
 kaaphi senior the dada or ham yangadhoni or saurav ganguli kii captaini main nehra apnasarvshereshth pradarshnakar chuke hai
 On the question of comparison between them, this fast bowler said that I, Yuvraj, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan were very young when we played under the captaincy of Sourav
 saurav kii ichha hamaare liye aadesh hoti thi
 Because they had more experience than us
 agar dada ne kaha ki kuch karne kii jarurat he to ham jaanate the ki ise puraa hona hi tha
 He had more fun under Dhoni's captaincy and said that when i returned to Dhoni's captaincy in 2009, i was more mature and i started to learn more about my bowling
 isliye dhoni kii captaini kaa anubhav kaaphi lutf uthaane vaala rahaa
 Nehra defended his captain when asked that 'captain Cool' was very critical of criticism
 media par naaraaz hue the dhonibangladesh ke khilaaf bhartiya team ke jeetne ke baad ek sawaal par dhoni aapa kho baithe the
 He satirized the Indian media while inviting the Australian journalist to sit close to him after missing the semi-final match against the West Indies in the World T20
 sawaal par nirbhar hota he aapkaa javabnehara ne kaha ki kitni baar aapane dhoni ko aapa khote dekha he

 From Abu Dhabi on 18 April to Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on 30 May, this time the Punjab team has made a mark in the IPL
 punjab ne lagaataar 5 maichon main jeet darj kii to point teble main bhi number van bani rahi
 The intentions of a team like Chennai, which can force a team to kneel three times, not one or two, can itself be guessed
 is baar punjab kii aandhi ke aage koi nahin tik sakaa he
 Maxwell and Miller's dashing pair delivered the bowlers' sixes, while Sandeep Sharma and Mitchell Johnson's rivals and speed also surrendered
 pehla qualifire haarane ke baad jab final main pahunchane ke liye chennai ke saath karo yaa maro muqabla hua to kisne sochaa tha ki virendra sahvaag kaa balla phir se aag ugalega? yani, pehali baar ipel jeetne se bas ek kadam dur khadi is punjab kii team ke liye ab kuch bhi karnaa naammumkin nahin

 lekin uske baad jeet kaa jo silsilaa shuru hua wo tab se badastoor jari he
 KKR then enunciated the slogan of his team's mantra 'korbo Lodbo Jeetbo Re' so much that after winning seven consecutive wins in the league round, Punjab became the No
 2 team in the points table
 qualifire-1 main punjab ko haraakar keker ne lagaataar aathvin jeet darj kii or ab keker duusari baar champion banane se bas ek kadam dur he

 ab lagata he ki ye kanoon jald hi paas ho jaayegaa lekin is kanoon ke kai pahaluon ko lekar abhi sawaal hai
 The purpose of this proposed law is to plant new trees in place of cut forests for industry and factories and to make the weak forests dense and healthy
 companiyaan van bhoomi ke istemaal ke badale muaavje ke taur par companessetary aforestation fund main paisa jamaa karti hai
 For which Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority or Campa is being formed
 kanoon ke tahat sarkaar campa ko sanvaidhanik darja degi jo fund ke istemaal kaa kaam dekhegi
 90 percent of the CAF fund will be with the states and 10 percent with the center
 fund kaa istemaal naye jangal lagane or vanya jeevon ko basaane, forest echosystem ko sudhaarney ke alaava infrastracchar banane ke liye hoga
 But experts also have doubts on this bill
 campa fund main ab tak 40 hazaar karod rupaya jamaa ho chukaa he
 It is obvious that big changes can be made with such a huge amount, but the way the reports of misuse of Campa Fund came out in the 2013 CAG report, the experts are referring to the lack of many provisions in the new bill
 khaas taur se infrastracchar devlepment shabd ke istemaal ko lekar
 Ritwik Dutta, an expert on environmental regulations and a lawyer, says, "in that CAG report, most of the Campa fund was spent on foreign tours of the officials, spent in installing AC, polishing the bathroom by installing tiles but the condition of the forest is the same Which was earlier
 isaliye bill main jab infrastrachar deveopment shabd istemaal kiya ja rahaa he to uski paribhaasha kahin par nahin bataai gai he
 Nobody knows what will happen in the name of this infrastructure? ' fund ke istemaal main gramsabhaaon kii bhagidaari ko lekar koi praavdhaan nahin he jabaki van adhikaar kanoon ke mutabik gramsabhaaon kii sahmati lenaa zaruri he
 Congress says that this law violates the Forest Rights Act
 congress ke varisht netaa or purv paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne is praavdhaan ko lekar pehle paryaavaran mantri prakaash jaavdekar ko chitthee likhi thi jisamen kanoon main sanshodhan karne kii baat kahi
 Ramesh was opposed to the forest rights of the tribals
 buudhvaar ko congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne bhi apni party kii baithak main kaha ki sarkaar adivaasiyon ke adhikaron kaa hanan kar rahi he
 Congress has proposed an amendment in the bill but it has the support of parties like the Left and JDU which will not be enough
 tippaniyan CPI leader d Raja said on Thursday that the question is not only about planting and protecting forests but also what will be the role of Gram Sabhas in the use of funds
 isaliye sanshodhan zaruri he
 According to sources, if there is not enough support, Congress will not vote on its amendment
 udhar sarkaar ne vipaksh ko bharosa diya he ki sieef fund ko lekar gramsabha ke role ko vah prashaskeey niyamon (akjicutive rules) main shaamil karegi

 udhar sarkaar ne vipaksh ko bharosa diya he ki sieef fund ko lekar gramsabha ke role ko vah prashaskeey niyamon (akjicutive rules) main shaamil karegi
 Under the law, the government will give Consta status to Campa which will look after the use of the fund
 sieef fund kaa 90 pratishat rajyon ko auki 10 pratishat centre ke paas rahegaa
 The fund will be used for planting new forests and settling wildlife, improving the forest ecosystem and building infrastructure
 lekin jaankaron ko is bill par shankaaen bhi hai
 40 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the Campa Fund so far
 zaahir he itani badi rakam se bade badlaav kiye ja sakate hai lekin 2013 main ai sieji report main jis tarah campa fund ke durupyog kii khabaren ain use lekar jaankaar naye bill main kai praavdhaanon kii kami kaa zikr kar rahe hai
 Especially with the use of the term infrastructure development
 paryaavaran niyamon ke jaankaar or vakil ruthvik datta kehete hai, ‘sieji kii us report main campa fund kaa adhiktar hissaa adhikariyon ke videshi dauron par kharch hua, asi lagane main kharch hua, tiles lagaakar bathroom ko chamakaane main kharch hua lekin jangal kii vahi haalat he jo pehle thi
 Therefore, when the term Infrastructure Development is being used in the bill, its definition is not mentioned anywhere
 koi nahin jaanata ki is infrastracchar ke naam par kya hoga?’ There is no provision for participation of gram sabhas in the use of funds, while according to the Forest Rights Act, consent of gram sabhas is required
 congress kaa kahana he ki ye kanoon van adhikaar kanoon kaa ulanghan karata he
 Senior Congress leader and former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh had earlier written a letter to Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar regarding this provision, in which it was asked to amend the law
 ramesh kaa virodh adivaasiyon ke van adhikaron ko lekar tha
 On Wednesday, Congress President Sonia Gandhi also said in her party meeting that the government is violating the rights of tribals
 congress ne bill main ek sanshodhan kaa prastaav rakhaa he lekin uske paas abhi left auki jediu jaisi partiyon kaa hi samarthan he jo paryaapt nahin hoga
 The comments sipiai ke netaa di raja ne guuruuvaar ko kaha ki sawaal sirf jangalon ko lagane or bachaane kaa nahin he balki ye bhi he ki fund ke istemaal main gramsabhaaon kii kya bhoomika hogi
 Therefore modification is necessary
 sutron ke mutabik paryaapt samarthan na hone par congress apane sanshodhan par voting nahin karaayegi
 On the other hand, the government has assured the opposition that it will include the role of Gram Sabha in the executive rules regarding CAF funds

 jis kisi ko bhi mobile se baat kerani hoti he, wo is tank par chadh jaataa he, phir baatcheet main magan ho jaataa he
 People searching for a network on a water tank are able to see the sight of Mongpal village, 33 km from Dantewada in Bastar
 subah se hi logpani kii tank parachadh jate hai
 Then the exercise begins to find the mobile network
 is tank par chadhane ke liye logon kaa din bhar tantaa laga rahata he
 People talk for hours on the upper part of the water tank
 jab pehali pari main chadhe logon kii baat puri ho jaati he, to upar chadhane kaa intjaar kar rahe duusari pari ke log apane doston or naate rishtedaaron se baatcheet karte hai
 There is no telephone in anyone's home in this village
 puri aabaadi mobile ke jariye sanchaar vyavastha se judi hui he
 It would not have been possible to provide a mobile network if the tank is not mounted
 yahi nahin is gaanv se lagbhag 33 kilometre dur tak jane ke baad hi mobile network miltaa he
 The budget for the pipeline was not approved
 To provide water in this village, the government had built this water tank by spending 48 lakh rupees, but the water tank, which was ready in the last month of 2014, should not be filled till date
 Could, it is because the pipeline did not exist here
 afasaron ne pani kii tank banane main khub dilchaspee dikhaai, lekin jab baari pipe line bichaane kii ai to mongpal gaanv se munh mode liya
 It was told that the budget itself was not approved for this
 saal dar saal do saal se zyada kaa vakt biit gaya
 From the sarpanch of the village to the head of the Collector, he pleaded in the Collector's office, so he never went round the Public Health Engineering Department, but it did not happen
 aakhirkar graminon ne iskaa nayaa upyog karnaa shuru kar diya
 Destroy the mobile tower Naxalimongpal village has a population of twelve and a half hundred
 ye ilaaka puri tarah senksal prabhavitahai
 BSNL had set up its mobile tower here, but it was blown up by the Naxalites
 beete paanch varshon main yahaan teen baar mobile tower lagaaya gaya, lekin teenon hi baar naksaliyon ne ise dhwast kar diya
 Bastar DIG says that the police and central security forces are making every effort to ensure that people get better mobile connectivity, but the Naxalites dabble on their aspirations
 bastar kaa dantewada ho yasukama, phir narayanpur ho yaa bijapur
 Naxalites do not want a mobile network anywhere
 mobile toweron ko nuksaan pahunchane ke chalate koi bhi nijee mobile company yahaan apane tower nahin lagaati
 a large population of this area needs as much water as the mobile network
 taaki ve bhi sanchaar suvidhaon kaa phayda uthaa saken

 supreme court main daayar yachika main sibiai ne kaha he ki nichali adaalat main maamle kii sunwaayee ke bich karti chidambaram ko jamaanat kaise mil sakati he
 Karti is alleged to have helped INX Media owners in 2007 to get Rs 305 crore from abroad
 jis vakt aisa kiya gaya tab unke pita or congress netaa pi
 Chidambaram was the Finance Minister
 is cese main karti or unke pita ke thikaanon par chhapemari ke baad unhen 28 farvari ko chennai airport se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 He was sent to jail after CBI remand by Delhi's Patiala House Court
 iske baad march main dilli hai court ne unhen jamaanat de di thi
 The CBI has now challenged in the Supreme Court
 karti chidambaram se sibiai ne ienex media kii maalik indrani mukherjee ko saamne baitaakar bhi poochtacha kii thi
 Indrani gave a confessional statement to the CBI
 duniya kii badi companiyon main shumaar appal or google sahit chaar tech companiyaan ek cese ko aapasi baatcheet se sulajhane ke liye kareeb 18,500 karod rupee chukaane ke liye raji ho gai hai
 It was alleged that these companies conspired by mutual agreement that they would not recruit each other's tech employees in their company, which would not increase the salaries of these employees
 is maamle kaa khulaasa us i-mail ke li hone se hua, jo appal ke purv pramukh steve jobs ne google ke siio erik smit or silicon vaili ke kuch companiyon ke maalikon ko bheji gai thi
 Following the revelation, some 64,000 tech employees in Silicon Valley filed suit against Apple, Google, Adobe and Intel, which was scheduled to begin trial in May of this year
 lekin trial shuru hone ke pehle hi in companiyon ne maamle ko tech karmchaariyon ke saath samjhauta kar sulajhaa liya he
 Under this agreement, these companies will pay about 18,500 crore to the tech workers
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki agar is maamle ko kanoonee taur par adaalat main suljhaayaa jaataa, to in companiyon ko kareeb 55,550 karod rupee dene padate
 Therefore, these companies thought it better to settle the matter outside the court

 Satbir said, "khap obey the rules of dignity set by King Harsha, for us to marry in the same gotra is called misconduct

 He says, "we live according to our moral values, dignity has to be protected at any cost and for this people can take someone's life and can even die
" par logon ko yah baat nahin samaj aati or hamen talibani yaa dabang qaraar diya jaataa he
 “limit and economic crisis together create an explosive situation

 a member of Malik Khap in Arya Nagar and retired Army Major Om Pal Singh says, "traditionally, we own one-third of the state's population and about 60 per cent of our land belongs to us
" ’’darasal, punjab land eliniation act 1901 ne jaaton ko jameen kaa malikana haq diya par daliton ko nahin

 a member of the Kanwar dynasty says, "tell Sonia that Khap never does injustice

 This was in response to Sonia Gandhi's remarks that she had made when she reached Jind to meet the family of a rape victim Dalit girl
 unhone kaha tha, ‘‘khap kanoon nahin tay kar sakate hai
 "but when they ask why most of the Dalit girls in Haryana are being raped and the guilty are Jats, then everyone is silent
