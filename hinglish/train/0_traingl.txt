 On September 7, in the case of the 2008 cash-for-vote scandal, Special Judge Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal, shortly after sent Amar Singh and two former BJP mps, Faggan Singh Kulaste and Mahavir Singh Bhagaura, to 13 days judicial custody
 Asked the police lawyer about the other two accused
 inamen se ek hai bhaajapa saansad ashok argal, jo abhi tak shikanje se is kaaran baahar bane rahane main safal rahe hai ki loksabhaadhyaksh mira kumaar se unki giraftaar kii ijaajat nahin mili he
 Secondly, Sudhindra Kulkarni, a former ally of senior BJP leader LK Advani, has so far ignored eight summonses - both in Delhi and Mumbai - and finally through his lawyer has informed the court that he is in the US
 nyaayadhish isse santusht nahin dikhin
 She wants to see both of them appear in court at the next hearing on 19 September
 15 agast ko india today kii aavaran katha main bataaya gaya he ki amar singh kis tarah poochtacha se batch gaye
 The parliamentary committee probing the scandal refused to interrogate a member of the Rajya Sabha, as it felt the process was more 'messy'
 isaki vajah se dilli police bhi amar singh ko lekar sust ho gai
 Now all eyes are on Amar Singh
 unhone jubaan khol di to upie ke liye samasyaayein paidaa ho sakati hai, jise amar singh ne 28 july, 2008 ke avishvaas prastaav se paar paane main madad kii thi
 The biggest open secret in Delhi is that they are in touch with senior Congress leaders
 avishvaas prastaav us samay aayaa tha, jab mulaayam singh yadav satta se baahar the or party main number do kii haisiyat rakhane vaale amar singh samaajawaadee party ko rajnatik akhaade main praasangik banaae rakhane par amada the
 He wanted to contest the election of Uttar Pradesh in alliance with the Congress, but this move ultimately failed
 teen saal baad, yah ghotaalaa or iske kai anuttarit sawaal, ab lambey mukademon kii disha main badhate najar aa rahe hai, kyonki koi nahin jaanata ki amar singh chup bane rahane ke liye kya maangenge
 Kulkarni, currently head of the Mumbai chapter of the Observer Research Foundation, a private think tank, is expected to return next week and appear before the police
 dilli police ke ek adhikari ne kaha, ''unhen jald hi giraftaar kar liya jayega
 "kulkarni, who took the role of busting the case, has been termed by the police as the main conspirator in the case of bribing three BJP mps to stay away from voting against the UPA-1 government
" dilli police ke aarope patr main kaha gaya he ki congress or samaajawaadee party ke netaaon se sampark karne, unhen uksaane or jaal main fansaane ke saare abhiyaan kii yojana kulkarni ke ghar par ek anya abhiyukt suhail hindustani ke saath milakar rachi gai
 The charge sheet states that "hindustani and Kulkarni's efforts were successful and each BJP MP for BJP was unable to comply with the Amar Singh Biswas proposal for Rs 3 crore
" dene ke liye raji ho gaye
 Argal, who is presently in Delhi, is blaming the Congress for influencing the Delhi Police and thus the charge sheet
 kulaste or bhagaura ke saath argal ko kathith rup se 2008 ke mat vibhaajan ke dauraan congress ke paksh main matdaan ke liye ghoose dene ke liye khoja gaya tha or unhone is ghatnakram ko record karne ke liye sting oparation karne main madad kii
 He says, "we respect the court's decision, but this decision is based on the charge sheet filed by the police
" aarope patr hamen bhrasht sabit karata he
 If we were corrupt, we would not have brought TV cameras to show the notes in Parliament
 '' ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''yah congress ne karavaaya he
 Why did the police remain silent for three years and now they took action after the order of the Supreme Court? Why were the media houses involved in this operation not accused? ”seven people have been accused
 amar singh ko tihaad main sangat dene ke liye purv sahyogi sanjeev saxena, kulaste, bhagaura or hindustani milenge, jisaki bahut jarurat bhi thi
 Before boarding the prison vehicle, Amar Singh took off his rings, including a gem-studded ring meant to protect him from misfortune
 rudraksh or ek pavitra dhaagaa unhone rahane diya jo unke daahine haath main bandhaa tha
 He made a few calls and comforted his supporters that he was an accused, not a criminal
 congress ne is maamle se dur rahane kii koshish kii he or jor diya he ki is maamle main giraftaaryaan supreme court kii dekharekh main chal rahi jaanch kii parinti hai
 Party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, "these arrests have been made after the completion of the investigation under the close supervision of the Supreme Court
" ''is bich kayaas lagaae gaye ki kya amar singh kii giraftaar jaanch ko sarkaar ke dwaar tak le jaaegi, kyonki is ghatnakram se aakhirkaar phayda laabh upie kaa hi hua tha
 And at the time of voting on the no confidence motion, Amar Singh was in the Samajwadi Party, the ally of the Congress

 In the negotiations between the Jat leaders and the state government agitating for the demand for reservation, it has been agreed
 shuukravaar shaam ko hui pehle daur kii baatcheet asafal rahi thi, lekin ab duusare daur kii baatcheet safal rahi
 Jat leader Vishwendra Singh informed about the end of the movement
 bataa den ki yah baatcheet aiji yaa sambhageeya ayukta karyaalay main hui
 Congress leaders Vishvendra Singh and Jat Sangharsh Samiti convenor Nem Singh joined on behalf of Jat leaders
 vahiin sarkaar kii taraf se samaaj kalyaan vibhaag ke nideshak samit sharma, sambhageeya ayukta subir kumaar, jila colector narendra kumaar gupta, aiji alok vashishtha sarkaar ke pratinidhi ke taur par baatcheet main shaamil hue
 Explain that due to the movement, the train and traffic were greatly affected
 nizamuddin kota special express ko radd kar diya gaya tha
 Simultaneously, the kota-patna Express and two other trains were run from Mathura
 isse pehle shuukravaar ko rajasthan ke bharatpur main aarakshan ko lekar jaaton ne jile ke sabhi rail or sadak margon par chakkaa jam shuru kar diya
 The Jat OBC of bharatpur-dholpur has been agitating for the demand for reservation for the last two years, under which they had warned the government about the blockade from June 23, about 15 days ago
 haalanki ek din pehle hi sarkaar par dhokhadhadi kaa aarope lagaakar congress vidhayak or bharatpur ke purv raja vishvendra singh ke netritv main alvar-mathura railway maarg par bahaj gaanv main jam laga diya
 According to Nem Singh, convenor of Mangat Jat Reservation Sangharsh Samiti, the Jats of both the districts should issue notification of reservation in OBC to the government soon
 jab tak yah faisla nahin ho jaataa, tab tak andolan khatm nahin hoga
 According to Congress MLA and former royal family member Vishwendra Singh, the state government has always been misleading the Jats on the issue of reservation, but this time the fight will cross
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne obisi ayog kii survey report ko le liya he, lekin is report par kaarywahi kar aarakshan kii adhisuchana kab tak jari kii jaaegi
 Only after the government tells it, the movement will be ended
 sabhi mantriyon par jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaate hue jat muslim mantri unuus khan se jat aarakshan kii ghoshnaa karwaane par ade hai
 They say that it is the month of Ramadan and PWD Minister Yunus Khan has kept fast, so cannot lie
 lihaaja jat aarakshan kii ghoshnaa inhen se karwaai jaae
 On the other hand, Social Welfare Minister Arun Chaturvedi says that the OBC report on Jat reservation has been submitted to the Chief Minister on Thursday evening, in such a case, end the Jat agitation
 andolan kii vajahrajasthan main dhaulpur or bharatpur ke jaaton ko chhodkar sabhi jilon ke jaaton ko aarakshan mila hua he
 They were not found on the basis that there was a Jat house in these districts
 dhaulpur ke jat rajgaraane kii purv mahraani to khud mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje hai
 But the number of Jats in Dholpur is negligible, so the whole movement is happening in Bharatpur
 2002 main tatkaaleen gahalot sarkaar ne in jilon ke jaaton ko bhi rajya sarkaar main aarakshan de diya tha, magar 2015 main supreme court ne is par roak laga di
 Bypolls in 2 assembly seats in Rajasthan 'congress party's image has come on the road
 mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke bete vaibhav gahalot kii rajasthan cricket association ke chunaav ladane ko lekar kai sawaal khadey hue hai
 State Congress President and State Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot has also jumped into the ruckus within the Congress Party regarding this
 'party kii chhavi ko ho rahaa nuksaan'sachin payalat ne kaha ki jis tarah se congress ke senior netaa rameshwar dudi ko rokane ke liye police lagaai gai thi, usase sarkaar ko bachanaa chahie tha
 This entire development has damaged the image of the Congress party
 aage payalat ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ashok gahalot ke betevaibhav gahalot chunaav lard rahe hanore aise main jo kuch ghatnakram media main saamne aayaa he
 He is not good for the party
 rajya main 2 vidhansabha siton par upachunaav ho rahe hai
 Such news is not good at such a time
 mukhyamantri ashok gahalot or rameshwar dudi donon hi congress ke bade netaa hai
 Sit and talk- Pilot, he said, 'CP Joshi is also a big leader of Congress
 in logon ko aise karne ke bajaay aapas main mil baith kar baat karnaa chahie tha
 The events that took place outside the Sawai Mansingh Stadium would provide an opportunity to target opponents
 ' agar sabhi log aapas main baithkar maamle ko sulajhaa lete to yah naubat nahin aati
 It is unfortunate to use a large number of police forces in this way and it will not have the right message on the image of the government

 haalanki aam dinon ke mukaable ayodhya ke aasapaas or shahar main suraksha ke bandobast kuch zyada the, lekin aam aadmi ko zyada pareshaani nahin thi
 It is definitely that everyone's eyes were on the Supreme Court's decision

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko karnataka ke bagalkot main chunavi sabha ko sambodhit kiya
 The PM once again mentioned Balakot Airstrike in his meeting and said that today Pakistan is going out into the world and shouting, save, it kills Modi
 unhone kaha ki congress-jedies kah rahe hai ki chunaav main balakot kaa mudda nahin uthaanaa chahie, isse hamaara votbank prabhavit hota he
 i want to ask both whether their vote bank is in Balakot or Bagalkot
 PM ne kaha ki jab hamane airstrike kii, to chot vahaan lagi lekin dard yahaan hua tha
 Initially, people were saying that Balakot is in India, everyone was saying that Modi is lying
 koi kah rahaa tha ki kahin bagalkot main to aisa nahin hua
 During the Congress forced government, Pakistan used to openly say that i am a 'jihadi', what can you do? The forced government of Congress used to cry

 After the Mumbai attack, the previous government was simply happy that he was a citizen of Pakistan
 duniya main jaakar congress kii majaboor sarkaar roti rahati thi, 2014 main jo majboot sarkaar bani pakistan ke ghar main jaakar aatankiyon ko maarthi he
 The Prime Minister said that whatever steps have been taken by India for development and self-confidence in the last 5 years is behind and only your blessing
 modi ne sirf aapke sevak ke naate, aapke chaukeedaar ke naate apana kaam kiya he
 He said that to see what a strong government is, look at Delhi
 majaboor sarkaar kya hoti he, agar wo dekhnaa he to bangaleru kii taraf dekho
 The PM said that the drama of the leaders has been going on here for the last one year, it is not taking the name of the end
 naatak bhi aisa jisamen imoshan he, revange he or imoshan to rukne kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa
 He said that every week, emotions are flowing in some rally or press conference
 pradhanmantri ne kaha ki is naatak ke chakkar main karnataka main vikaas ke kaary puri tarah thap hai
 What happened to the debt waiver of the farmer? What happened to irrigation schemes? What happened to drought relief? And the government here does not have time to worry about sugarcane farmers

 For Sonakshi, this film could be the turning point of her career

 green tii ek prakritik chaay he, jo hamaare swasthya ke liye kai tarah se phydemand he
 When we consume green tea, it also benefits our skin and hair
 aaie, twachaa or baalo se judi saamaanya samasyaon par green tii ke jariye hone vaale phaayde par najar daalate hai
 
 
 Get rid of blemishes: Generally people have trouble with spots or pimples
 kai baar kriim or dawaaon kaa prayog karne ke baad bhi chahare ke nishaan nahin jate
 For this, keep green tea boiled in water and face cleansing with this water several times a day
 iske baad moscharizer kaa prayog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 To make green tea moisturizer at home, a few drops of coconut oil, almond oil can be mixed with green leaves of tea and made into a paste and applied to stains or pimples
 yah moscharizer cheharaa or twachaa chikani rakhti he
 Shining eyes: We all spend most of our time watching videos on TV, computer or mobile screen
 aamtaur par is vajah se ankhon main khujali, laali yaa ankhon main pani kii samasya ho jaati he
 To avoid these problems, we often use eye drops or this type of gel
 green tii ke thande pani se 20 minute tak sikai karke is tarah kii samasyaon ko aasaani se dur kiya ja saktaa he
 The anti-oxidant element of green tea leaves relieves eye nerves by relieving them
 baalo ke liye phydemand:har ladki kaa sapana hota he ki uske bal sundar or aakarshak hon
 Green tea is also beneficial for this
 gharelu upachaar ke liye baalo ko shampoo se dhone ke baad condishnar ke rup main green tii ke pani kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, applying green tea leaves along with curd and eggs to the hair increases the length of hair and increases its shine
 kendriya mantri ramvilas paswan ne kaha he ki jis tareeke se nae sharabbandi kanoon main is baat kaa praavdhaan he ki agar kisi ke ghar main sharaab kii bottle milti he to us ghar ke tamaam vyakti jo ki 18 saal se umr se zyada ke hai, un sabhi ko giraftaar kar jail bheja jayega
 On the same lines, if liquor is found somewhere in the state of Bihar, then the Chief Minister should be arrested and sent to jail, taking responsibility for it
 ramvilas paswan ne yah baaten puraneshrabbandikanoon ko khaarij karne vaali patna hai court ke faisle par roak lagane ke baad kahin
 He said that the strict decision has been taken that all the adults in the house will have to go to jail, CM should also be arrested and sent to jail on the same lines, if alcohol is found anywhere in the state
 patna main patrakaron se baatcheet karte hue paswan ne kaha kii algepi sharabbandi ke khilaaf nahin he, lekin jis tareeke sekanoonbana die gaye hai use unki party asweekaar karti he or uske khilaaf he
 On the other hand, in the manner in which Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has accused the Prime Minister of touting the blood of the martyrs, Paswan said that the people of the country are watching and understanding all this
 unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi ko maryaada main rahakar baaten kehani chahie
 Paswan said that the Prime Minister does not make any difference to anyone saying anything
 rahul gandhi ko apni baaten maryaada main rahakar kehani chahie
 In the last 25 years, the Indian cricket team has won many matches across the country and the world, but its dream of winning a Test match at Lord's, called the Mecca of Cricket, is still incomplete
 bhartiya team ne lords main antim baar 1986 main kapil dev kii captaini main test match jeeta tha, lekin tab se lekar aaj tak ek twanti-20 or ek 50 over vishwa cap jeetne ke saath-saath test variyata kram main pehla sthaan praapt karne ke baavjood uske khilaadiyon kaa lords kii balakani main jeet kii khushi manaane kaa sapana puraa nahin ho sakaa he
 After Kapil, India saw many captains in the form of Sachin Tendulkar, Srikanth, Mohammad Azharuddin, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, but none could succeed in winning their team at Lord's
 dhoni kii captaini main bhartiya team ne safalataa ke ek se badhkar ek kirtiman sthapit kiye hai
 From this point of view, it will be a matter of whether Dhoni can finish this 25 year long wait of his team or not
 bhartiya team ne jab aakhri baar lords main jeet kaa swaad chakhaa tha, tab maujuuda team kaa koi khilaadi antarrashtriya patal par padaarpan nahin kar paaya tha
 There are many players who were not even born at that time, while there are many who started reading the story of cricket
 bharat ne is maidan par ab tak english team ke saath kul 15 match khele hai, jinamein se 10 main use haar mili he, jabaki chaar mukaable barabari par chute hai
 In this sense, the 1986 victory is very important for him
 bhartiya team ne paanch se 10 june ke bich khele gaye us test match ko dilip vengsarakar (126) ke shandaar shatak or kapil tathaa chetan sharma kii umdaa gendbaaji kii badaulat jeeta tha
 India scored 341 runs in their first innings thanks to the brilliant batting of Vengsarkar and Mohinder Amarnath (69)
 usase pehle usne 64 ran dekar paanch wicket jhatakane vaale chetan or 55 ran dekar teen wicket lene vaale roger binni kii badaulat english team kii pehali pari 294 ranon par samet di thi
 It included Graham Gooch's 114 and Derek Pringle's 63
 duusari pari main kapil ne chaar or maninder singh ne teen wicket lekar english team ko 180 ranon par dher kar diya tha
 Mike Gatting was the highest scorer with 40 and Allen Lamb scoring 39
 bharat ko yah match jeetne ke liye 134 ranon kaa lakshya mila tha, jise usne paanch wicket khokar hasil kar liya tha
 Vengsarkar, who has always batted well against England, scored the highest 33 runs in the second innings as well
 ravi shastri 20 or ajaharuddin 14 ran par naabad laute the
 Gavaskar had 22 runs off his bat
 kapil ko shandaar gendbaaji or umdaa captaini ke liye main of da match chunaa gaya tha
 The new day of 'bigg Boss' has brought new challenges
 aaj big bos ke ghar main ejaj khan pehle chalanger ke taur par kadam rakhenge
 With the move to Ijaz's house, there will be new diversions and new types of upheavals
 aaj 100waan din he or'big bos'fries-relies lagjri task kii ghoshnaa karenge
 All the members of the household will have to be bound by these rules while Ijaz will not be bound to abide by these rules
 unhen ghar ke sadasyon ko is task ke dauraan tang karnaa hoga
 As soon as the task starts, all the members of the house will freeze
 iske saath hi 'big bos' ejaj par khamosh rahane kii pabandi hataa denge
 With this, Ijaz will get the task that he can take the people of the house to visit the house in his own style
 isi dauraan ejaj khub masti karenge
 Ijaz will bother Ali a lot
 ejaj ali ke upar jail daal denge or chehre par paper lapet denge
 For the second time, Ijaz will wrap tissue paper on his mouth
 iske baad ali turant ise saaf karenge or ejaj se kahenge ki ve aisa kuch na karen
 Not only this, when the members of the house freeze, Puneet Issarki's wife Deepali Issar will come, but they will not be able to move from their place
 gujarat ke chunavi samay main yun to mukhya muqabla bijepi banaam congress he lekin chote-chote dal bhi yahaan bada khel karne kii kuvat rakhte hai
 Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati is preparing to contest all the seats in Gujarat
 maaya kaa ye daanv is chunavi samar main dalit netaa jignesh ke sahare bijepi ko maat dene kii congress kii ummiido par pani pher saktaa he
 The special thing is that Mayawati, the arch-rival of BJP, is being said to be a profitable deal for this party with lotus flower, the entry in Gujarat
 raajnneetik jaankaar maanate hai ki gujarat main chunki mayawati sabhi siton par chunaav ladengi to wo jignesh ke chalate dalit voton par haq jataa rahi congress ke liye khatre kii ghanti hogi kyonki maaya kii entry se dalit vot bantenge
 The special thing is that Bahujan Samaj Party has no notable support base in Gujarat
 party kaa waha se ab tak ek bhi vidhayak jitkar nahin aayaa he
 But despite this, whenever the elephant has landed here, it has played a big role in deciding defeat and victory in many seats
 gujarat main dalit-adivasaigujrat main 7 fisadi dalit matadaata hai, to vahiin 11 fisadi adivasee hai
 Out of total 182 assembly seats in the state, 10 are Dalit majority seats
 iske alaava 26 vidhansabha siten aisi hai jahaan adivasee jeet haar tay karte hai
 There are 40 assembly seats in Gujarat which are reserved for Dalits and Adivasis
 inamen se 27 siten anusuchit janajati ke liye or 13 siten anusuchit jati ke liye surakshit hai
 bsp's base in Gujarat Even though the BSP has not won a single seat in the assembly elections held in Gujarat so far, its enthusiasm to contest elections has not declined
 is baar bhi bispi ne gujarat kii 182 siton par puri takat ke saath utarane kaa man banaaya he
 The BSP fielded 34 of its candidates in the 2002 assembly elections, none of which won
 2002 main bispi ko 0
 32 percent votes were received
 2007 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bispi ne 166 ummidavaar utaare or sabhi ko haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa
 Although the party was successful in increasing its vote share, it got 2
 62 fisadi vot mila
 In 2012, the BSP fought in 163 assembly seats
 25 fisadi vot mila
 That is, BSP suffered losses as compared to 2007
 dalit siten bijepi ke paspichley vidhansabha chunaav 2012 main adivasee siton par congress kaa dabadabaa tha, to vahiin anusuchit jati kii siton par bijepi ne baaji maari thi
 The Congress could win only three Vadgam, Kadhi and Danilimada assembly seats out of 13 seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SC) of the state
 jabaki bijepi vadodara, eader, gandhidam, bardoli, asarava sahit 10 siton par kabiz he
 Tribal seats In the Congress bag, likewise, 27 tribal seats were elected, Chhotu Vasava of JDU was elected on one of these, Congress won 16 out of the remaining 26 assembly seats and 10 seats went to bjp's account
 par is baar jatigat andolan ke chalate in siton kaa siyaasi sameekaran badla he or in par sabaki najar he
 BJP will benefit from BSP: Ashok Dalit thinker Ashok Bhartiya said that BJP will benefit and the Congress will have to suffer with BSP entering Gujarat elections
 congress ne jarur jignesh mewaani ko gale lagaaya he lekin wo bahut zyada prabhaav daalane main safal nahin ho paaenge, kyonki jignesh kaa aadhaar gujarat ke shahari dalit matadaataaon main he

 satta kabutar par lage yaa cricket par he he to satta hi
 Its basic methods do not change
 sattebaajon kii najar itani paini hoti he ki udate kabutar kii bhi chaal pahchaan lete hai
 And one is our own government that is so weak that even the hand blows the pigeon
 darasal sattebaaji kaa itihaas sadiyon purana he
 There were different forms of betting in different times
 or unheen shaklon ko samet kar ham aapke liye laae hai ye khaas peshkash
 
 
 From Pigeon to Cricket
 
 
 mughal sultanate kii kahaniyon main khaas jagah rakhane vaali noorjahan or jahangir kii daastaan kii sabase khubasurat pahalu he unki pehali mulaakaat
 And the witness of his first meeting with coincidence was a pigeon
 vahi kabutar jisaki udaan behad dilkash hua karti he
 But the changing times caused the pigeons to play bets
 daanv is baat par ki koun sa kabutar kitni oonchi udaan bharta he yaa kis raftaar se udaan bharta he
 If the synergy between the claimant and the pigeon fits properly, then the claimant is twenty-two
 angrejon kaa daur aate-aate satta itnaa aam ho gaya ki is par roak lagane ke liye 1866 gambling act bananaa padaa
 At that time, there was a huge speculative market from Bombay and Delhi of Calcutta
 phir aaj ke daur tak aate-aate to khayr is khel ne khel ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 But cricket in white clothes was really a gentleman's game then
 angrej chunki hindustan main hi the lihaaja unhen ball phenkate-phenkate hamane bhi jald hi is khel ke gur sikh liye
 In 47, the British left but we had learned their game
 shuru main hamane jeet kaa lanbaa intjaar kiya
 But today we are working behind that power, on the strength of which we remained steadfast in the field
 phir assi ke dashak main cricket maidan se uth kar tivi par aa gaya
 On the other hand, the condition of hockey was becoming increasingly thin
 lihaaja dam todate hockey or ghar-ghar main ghus rahe tivi ne dekhte hi dekhte kicket ko sir maathe par bitha diya
 As the times changed, black and white photographs also started to be colored like memories
 blike and white tivi ke baad color tivi kaa daur shuru hua to maidan kii hari-hari ghaas sachmuch hari dikhne lagi
 But the clothes still looked white
 or unheen safed kapadon main log ek din kaa rest lete hue chah din tak test match kaa lutf uthaa rahe the
 But the TV was colored
 tivi kaa bazaar angadaai lene ko betaab tha
 So how long did the clothes stay white? Thus, cricket was created to color white
 chah din ke test ke baad paidaa hua ek din kaa ye baccha bachapan se hi itnaa kamau put nikalegaa, iskaa andaaza khud unhen bhi nahin tha jinhone ise paidaa kiya
 Mumbai's BCCI family was poor till the birth of the second ICC child ie one-day, but the family was still happy
 lekin is bachche ke aate hi uski takadir aisi palati ki wo dekhte hi dekhte duniya kaa sabase amir parivaar yani amir board ban gaya
 If money comes then power also comes
 ab cricket ke maidan par bisisiai kii hukumat thi
 But with this one-day, there was a bad omen in cricket
 match phiksig kaa
 Cricket was enticing house to house on color TV
 ghar-ghar main match dekhe ja rahe the
 And at the same time, underworld don Dawood Ibrahim had gone homeless from his own house, that is, he had fled to India and reached Dubai
 tab tak cricket bhi registan kaa rukh kar chukaa tha
 India and Pakistan matches started in Sharjah
 match hit sabit hua
 Dawood appears in Sharjah only after escaping from Mumbai
 cricketh uskaa shauk tha
 He watches every match for the sake of hobby
 par phir kab ye shauk uskaa karabor ban gaya kisi ko pataa hi nahin chalaa
 And by the time it was found out, Dawood had made the game a new game
 khel satta kaa
 Game of match fixing
 khel spot phixing kaa
 Now the players would play in the field
 par kaise khelenge gaye di-company tay karata
 There was one-day ideal cricket for match fixing and betting
 ek hi din main fatafat nateeja or fatafat kamai
 The business started in full swing
 paase se kabutar, kabutar se mataka or matake se mobile
 Speculators resorted to new technology in every round to run their business
 lekin tab tak ye dhandha aam logon ke haathon main hi tha
 But as soon as one-day cricket was born and color from TV black and white, suddenly the business became the underworld
 phir to jo khel shuru hua to bas thamane kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa
 When the other children of the International Cricket Council, the ICC, got overshadowed by the d-company on one-day, they got up from the cricket ground and reached the mobile via satellite phone, pager and computer
 do tiimon ke bich puraa match hi fiks kara dene kii sambhaavna ne sattebaaji kii puri tasviir hi badal kar rakh di
 The game was such that neither shop nor office was required to play and feed this game
 or naa hi puunji lagane kii
 The shop opened with the bus, phone and paper slip
 bas iske liye satte kaa bhav kholane vaali di-company kaa aashirwad use jarur hasil hona chahie
 That is, asafoetida is not alum and profits of crores
 upar se jokhim bhi nahin
 Because even if caught, a punishment of a few months or a fine of a few hundred rupees
 andervarlad ke liye bhala isse phaayde kaa sauda or kya ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, this became the biggest speculation of d-company earnings
 khel jari tha
 Inside the field as well as outside the field
 halanki usee daur main bich-bich main phixing kaa jinn bottle se baahar bhi aayaa
 Many players also fell
 hallaa-hangaamaa hua
 Cleanliness occurred with Russian
 par dhandha phir bhi chalata rahaa
 But in the meantime, the third ICC child was born
 jiskaa naam rakhaa gaya tii-20
 This child turned out to be more promising than the other child
 paidaa hote hi ye sabase pehle team india kii hi god main aayaa
 bcci's Lalit Modi decided to give birth to his twin brother in the shape of the IPL
 faisla kargar rahaa
 Fakat being a few hundred, then thousand, lakh, now cricket has become a game of crores
 bisisiai amir se or amir hoti chali gai or khilaadi lakhpati se karodpati or karodpati se arbapati banate gaye
 The rushing players on the 22-yard pitch suddenly fell under the hammer
 khilaadiyon kii boli lagane lagi
 The spectacle was going live
 khilaadi kii ahmiyat ab uske khel se nahin balki uske kharidne or bikne kii keemat se hone lagi
 The sweep that started with the six-day Test match was over three hundred overs a day, reaching the spectacle of three hours
 van-de se bhi kahin zyada tii-20 satta bazaar ke liye kamau put ban gaya
 Faqat 240 balls from three hours and 40 overs made every ball salable
 tamaasha aisa tha ki jo paise ke liye nahin bik rahe the, unhen nite party kii ranginiyon ne bikwa diya
 But cricket boards around the world were also vigilant
 lihaaza puraa match fiks karne kaa jokhim uthaane kii bajaae anderworld ne ek nayaa khel ijad kiya
 Spot fixing
 spot phixing yani jisase match ke nattejey par to sidhaa asar naa pade, par seshan yaa over bik jaae
 That is, if the result of two-four overs of a match is already known, then the earning of several hundred crores is confirmed
 dressing room karachi main, changing room dubai main or jis pich par match khelaa janaa he wo maidan bharat main
 The gesture would have been from Karachi, the vault would have opened in Dubai and the vault would have been filled with money from India
 bas yahi khel he satte kaa or yahi khel he di-company kaa
 And this is the speculation of today which itself is fixed
 khel duniya kii kisi bhi pich par ho, par is khel kaa asli khilaadi karachi ke dressing room main hi baithta he
 And from there, he sits and plays in such a way that the third umpire cannot see anything even after watching the replay
 ji haa
 The real king of the betting game is the boss of d-company i
e
 Dawood Ibrahim
 match phixing se lekar spot phixing sab usee ke gande jehan kii paidaaish he
 But he has retained his younger brother Anees Ibrahim, the CEO of the betting company
 yani puraa dhandha anis hi dekhtaa he
 Anees sets his game according to the ICC calendar
 karachi main baith kar
 But he keeps an eye on the matches in which the teams of India or Pakistan are playing
 kyonki sari kamai inhen do tiimon se hoti hai
 d Company's speculative headquarters is in Burj Dera, Dubai

 And this work is done by Sunil Dubai
 karachi se ishaara milane ke baad sunil dubai manoj metro or pawan hindustan or pakistan main apane agent se sampark sadhate hai
 d-company's biggest betting boss in India is Surendra Bargi aka Kolkata Junior
 karachi main wo thikaane he jahaan se ipel main spot phixing kaa puraa khel khelaa ja rahaa tha
 From where the line of Satta reached Hindustan via Dubai
 ye wo garh he jahaan se ipel ke mukaable spot fiks kiye ja rahe hai
 These are the bases from where the biggest attack on Indian cricket is taking place
 ye daaud ibrahim kaa karachi kaa wo pataa he jahaan se uskaa chota bhai anis ibrahim ipel ke khilaadiyon kii boli lagavata he
 The second address is of Dubai

 This is the vicious bookie of cricket who books the accounts of the Baji sitting in Dubai for d Company through hawala
 ali budesh par hindustan main do darjan sangeen mukademen chal rahe hai
 This is the person who got the leg of Dawood Ibrahim in Dubai and now intends to dislodge Dawood's foot in the betting game
 mumbai main di company kaa satta exange chalaane vaala sabase bada gurga ramesh vyas he
 In interrogation, Ramesh Vyas has revealed that he was linking betting lines with Hindustan for 14 big bookies of Pakistan but in these 14 six bookies were directly Anees Ibrahim's pieces
 anis ibrahim ke mohare chah bookijon ke naam hai- vicky, jambo, kumaar, master salmaan, doctor javed or sharif in bookies ke jariye spot phixing kii kaali kamai ho rahi thi
 According to sources, Vyas had added Karachi's line exclusively to the three bookies of Hindustan at the behest of Anees Ibrahim
 in bookies main dilli ke tinku or bharat ke alaava jupiter kaa naam pramukh he
 This same betting of bookies forced Sreesanth and carried out spot fixing through ash and cash
 junior kolkata ke naam se mashhoor surendra bangadi ko satte kii duniya main mistar india bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki ye police kii radar par to rahata he lekin giraft se baahar
 If sources are to be believed, Surendra Bangdi's wires are directly connected to Sunil Dubai sitting in Dubai
 police sutron ke mutabik 14 may ko jab mumbai police kii red kalba devi main padi or jaise hi ramesh vyas ko dabocha tab tak surendra bangadi ko khabar ho chuki thi
 Sources say that in today's world of betting, there is no player bigger than Bangadi and he is in direct contact with many players of IPL
 sach to ye he ki bangadi ke giraftaar hone ke baad hi indian anderworld lig kaa asli cheharaa saamne aayega

 a full span of music in Indian cinema is named after Rahul Dev Burman
 ise sunaharaa daur kaha jaataa he
 The music fan made this unique funk, sometimes composed the fan's voice and sometimes the traffic jam became the inspiration for him to create the tune
 rahul dev burman ke kai saakshaatkaar le chuke film patrkaar taroji devdhar ne kaha ‘unke andar sangeet is kadar rachabsa tha ki dhun taiyaar karne ke liye unhen kisi khaas maahaul kii jarurat nahin padati thi
 He felt the music in a voice and made a tune on it
 unhone chalate hue pankhe se nikalati aawaaj par bhi dhun taiyaar kii thi
 He used it in the song 'suno Kaho, Kah Suna' from the film 'aapri Kasam'
 ’devdhar ne bataaya ‘pehali patni se alag hone ke baad ek baar rahul dev burman ek hotel main ruke the
 He was accompanied by his guitar player Bhanu Gupta
 vah baithe baithe yun kii guitar baja rahe the ki achaanak pancham ke dimag main ek dhun aa gai
 He told that tune to Bhanu
 yah dhun ‘parichay’ film ke geet ‘musafir hum yaaro’ kii duusari pankti kii thi
 After this, both of them kept working overnight and by morning the whole song was ready
 ’burman par ‘pancham ke saat sur’ likhane vaali veeraa chaturvedi ne kaha ‘is baat par bahut hi kam logon kaa dhyaan gaya hoga ki ‘pather panchali’ kaa tital mujeec or ‘musafir hum yaaro’ geet bahut milte julate hai
 The reason for this is that Pancham Ali was a disciple of Akbar Khan Sahab, so Khan Sahab's music had a profound influence on him
 ’devdhar ke anusaar, pancham or film nirmaataa ramesh bahal ke bich gahari dosti thi
 Once both had dinner, they went to eat ice cream and got stuck in a jam
 gaadi ramesh chalaa rahe the or burman baithe the
 The car sometimes stopped in jam and sometimes moved very slowly
 burman sab dekh rahe the tathaa kuch gunaguna rahe the or vahiin unhone ek dhun taiyaar kar lee
 This tune was later used in the song 'tere Bina Jiya Jaay Na' from the film 'ghar'
 dilachasp baat yah he ki unhone is geet ke antare main ‘funtoosh’ film ke geet ‘dukhi man mere’ kii tun kaa upyog bahut hi chaturaai ke saath kiya
 The music for 'funtush' was by SD Burman, father of Pancham
 isi film ke geet ‘i meri topi palat ke aa’ kii dhun pancham ne taiyaar kii thi lekin na yah baat kisi ko pataa chal pai or na hi pancham ne kabhi iskaa shrey lenaa chaha
 But Pancham and his father congratulated each other for the popularity of this song
 veeraa ne kaha ki es di burman kaa jhukaav jahaan vishuddh bhartiya shastreey sangeet kii ore tha vahiin pancham apane sangeet main pashchim kaa prabhaav jarur daalate the
 For the film 'aradhana' many times it was said that its music was composed by Rahul Dev Burman
 lekin vastav main is film kii sangeet rachana unke pita es di burman ne kii thi
 In those days, Pancham was his father's assistant
 23 june 1939 ko janme rahul dev burman ne chaar janvari 1994 ko aakhri saans lee

 Whatever be the decision, through this, there has been a reduction in corruption in the basic facilities other than the distribution of food grains at the lower level, but there are also a large number of people who are facing difficulties due to lack of base

 Everyone is relieved in the litigants of Uttarakhand
 lekin pradesh ke astitv main aane ke baad se hi kisi bhi mukhyamantri ko siem awaas main sukun naseeb nahin hua
 Every CM here avoided the Chief Minister's residence, while the Chief Minister's house has been built at a cost of crores of rupees

 It is not that the leaders have liked simplicity but the reason behind it is actually a fear story
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den ki mukhyamantri awaas par na to bhoot-pret kaa saaya he or na hi kisi se khatra
 The chief of the state, Harish Rawat, has been camping in Dehradun's only guest house since he assumed power
 yani ‘raja’ beghar he or ‘rajmahal’ main sannata he
 In such a situation, the question is floating in the winds, why are the 'rajas' hesitating to stay in 'rajmahal'? Is there any shadow of Vastu defect on the palace! From the pages of history

 The house was ready, but before entering it, Khanduri departed from power
 nae awaas main daakhil hone kaa chance mila siem dow
 Ramesh Pokhriyal to Nishank
 lekin sanyog dekhie kuch dinon baad hi unki bhi kursi chhin gai
 Khanduri returned and he too could spend three months in the new residence
 jaahir he koi bhi netaa apni raajnneeti main is 'dosha' ko jagah nahin dena chahta

 After Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, MNS President Raj Thackeray has become the second such leader who has been blamed for the party's crushing defeat

 is abhiyaan ke dar se april 1984 main jaranel singh bhindrawaale golden temple se sate guru nanak nivas se akaal takht ja pahunchaa tha
 The Akal Takht is right in front of the Golden Temple, which was to become its destination
 bhindrawaale yaheen se khalistaan movement kaa sanchaalan karne laga tha
 In such a situation, the Indira government converted Amritsar in Punjab into an army camp

 On the night of June 3, gunshots were heard in the Gold Temple
 isi dauraan sena ne bhindrawaale kaa vahiin par khatm kar diya
 Actually, Shri Harminder Sahib is very important among the Sikh community
 sikh samudaay kaa sabase bada dharmik sthal mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, the Sikh community became angry with Indira Gandhi for being allowed to shoot there
 isi ke chalate baad main unhen unke sikh suraksha karmi ne goli markar hatya kar di thi

 He said that the Mumbai Police should be ashamed
 They have stopped me from using my civil rights

 i am a citizen of law

 But they are not letting me meet them
 jabaki party ke vidhayak mujhase milanaa chaahate hai
 i want to make it clear to you that the argument given by Mumbai Police is far from the truth
 unhone kaha ki bijepi baagiyon ko suraksha de rahi he
 Shivkumar had asked ANI to let the Mumbai Police and the rest of the forces deploy, let them do their duty
 ham apane mitron se milane aae hai
 We were born together in politics and in politics we will die together
 ve hamaari party ke sadsy hai
 We have come to meet them
 'dike sivakumar ne kaha tha ki maine yahaan ek cameraa book kiya he
 My friends are staying here
 ek choti si samasya ho gai he, ham baatcheet karenge
 There is no question of being threatened, we love and respect each other
 ' hotel ke baahar roke jane par dike sivakumar ne police adhikariyon se kaha ki mere paas koi hathiyaar nahin hai
 Why am i not being allowed inside bataa den ki mumbai ke ek hotel main shanivaar se ruke karnataka (karnataka) ke baagi vidhayakon ne police se suraksha kii maang kii thi

 Kumaraswamy and Mr
 Sivakumar may cause uproar in the hotel and we feel threatened by them
" ham unase milanaa nahin chaahate
 Please help us in this matter and do not allow those people to enter the hotel
 ' (input: eenai se bhi) Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has expressed apprehension that if Narendra Modi again takes over the power of the country, elections may be stopped in the country
 unhone china or rus kaa ullekh karte hue bharat main taanaashaahee shashan aane kii bhi ashanka jataai
 Senior Congress leader and CM Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday accused 'democracy and the Constitution' of being a threat during the tenure of the Narendra Modi government
 unhone daawa kiya ki agar janata ne modi ko phir se satta saunpi, to ho saktaa he ki hamaare yahaan (bharat main) chunaav na hon yaa phir china or rus jaisi sthiti ho
 He also alleged that the Prime Minister can go to any extent to win the election and he is targeting opponents
 gahalot ne piem modi par tanj kasate hue daawa kiya ki modi ‘marketing ke master' hai or ‘agar vah bollywood main hote to apane latake-jhatkon evam adaaon se desh tathaa duniya main alag chhap chhodte
 'gehlot said in an interview that' the truth is in our favor and we believe that the truth will prevail
 'yah puche jane par ki agar congress haar gai to kya sachai kii haar hogi, unhone kaha ki agar janata unhen jita detii he
 
 
 If Modi ji wins again, there is no guarantee that elections will be held in the country or not
 ' unhone kaha ki chunaav honge bhi or nahin bhi honge
 
 
 Like in China, Russia
 'gauratlab he ki china main ekal party kii vyavastha he jabaki rus main vladimir putin lambey samay se raashtrapati ke pad par bane hue hai
 Gehlot claimed that Modi ji can go to any extent
 chunaav jeetne se pehle bhi or baad main bhi vah kisi bhi had tak ja sakate hai
 What is on his mind, i think even Amit Shah does not know
 rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ne aarope lagaaya ki loktantr khatre main he, samvidhan khatre main he or desh khatre main he
 Only two people in the country
 
 
 narendra modi or amit shah sarkaar chalaa rahe hai
 Gehlot, who was the Congress general secretary till a few months ago, said that Modi ji had got a clear majority after Rajiv Gandhi
 unako sochna tha ki jimmedaari bad gai he or unhen jimmedaripurn vyavhaar karnaa chahie tha
 But he missed the opportunity
 congress ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki log chaar saal pehle kehane lag gaye the ki yah aadmi chunaav ke liye kuch bhi kar saktaa he
 Can also cause war
 kisi pradhanmantri ke bare main yah dhaaran bananaa thik nahin he
 The Prime Minister is the one who talks about touching the heart of the people
 gahalot ne kaha ki modi ji ko chahie ki vah muddon kii raajnneeti karen
 But he is doing politics in the name of nationalism
 gahalot ne sawaal kiya ki kya ham rashtravaadi nahin hai?unhone daawa kiya ki pi chidambaram or duusare netaaon ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya he
 Are all the people in the BJP washed with milk? Gehlot said that Amit Shah says that we will rule for 50 years, that's why we say that these are hangman people
 virodhiyon ko nishaanaa banaate hai, kanoon ko apana kaam nahin karne dete
 Taking a dig at the Prime Minister's 'main Bhi Chowkidar' campaign, Gehlot said that wherever he goes, people say that the watchman is a thief
 ab unhone ‘main bhi chaukeedaar' abhiyaan shuru kiya
 All ministers changed the names of Twitter handles
 ve baikfoot par aa gaye hai
 Did black money come back from abroad if you actually did the watchman? What happened to jobs? The Congress leader also targeted the BJP and said that there is hate and anger in his DNA
 loktantr main aapke bheetar sahishnutaa honi chahie
 There is no tolerance inside them
 unhone yah bhi aarope lagaaya ki videsh kii dharti par jansabhaayen karne vaale modi desh ke pehle pradhanmantri hai or iske liye unhone bhartiya duutavaason kaa durupyog kiya he
 Gehlot also claimed that BJP and RSS are working beyond the constitution in the country and imposing their ideology on institutions

 The reason is that there is a taxi driver who makes it and the poor come here for treatment
 unhone donneton or seaving ke paise se aspataal taiyaar karavaaya he
 Many people have been influenced by Saidul's big dreams and passion for realizing it
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apane 'man kii baat' kaarykram main saidul ke prayaason kii saraahna kii thi
 The 40-year-old taxi driver said he was excited by Modi's discussion about the hospital
 ieenes ke mutabik, taxi driver saidul lashkar ne 2004 main apni bahan marupha ke asamyik nidhan ke baad garibon ke ilaaj ke liye aspataal banane kaa faisla kiya tha
 Marufa died at just 17 years of age due to a chest infection
 saidul ke paas us samay utane paise nahin the ki vah dur shahar jaakar bade aspataal main apni bahan kaa ilaaj karavaate
 Saidul, standing on the wall of the newly built patients' waiting hall of the Marufa Smriti Welfare Foundation at Punri village near Baruipur, about 55 km from Kolkata
 Like, the poor do not have to lose their lives due to lack of means of treatment
 ve taxi chalaate samay apni gaadi main baithe paisanger ko apane kagajaat va logon se mili daan kii parchiyaan dikhaate, magar adhikansh log unki koi madad karne se inkaar kar dete the
 However some people also helped him
 unhone kaha- patni hameshaa mere saath khadi raheen
 He gave me all his jewelry to raise money for the land
 aakhirkaar, farvari 2017 ko aspataal shuru hone par saidul kaa sapana saakaar hua
 On the way to the hospital, e-rickshaw driver Sojol Das said - Now there is discussion everywhere and people talk about the hospital in the area
 ab is aspataal ko 50 bistaron se susajjit or eks-re va isiji kii suvidha se las banane kii disha main kaam chal rahaa he

 mana jaataa he ki jivan main yash or apyash ke liye kuch grahon kii bhoomika hoti he
 Let's know about these conditions of planets
 
 
 
 Role of planets in Yash and Apayash: - The position of a person's fame is seen from the fourth, seventh and tenth house of the horoscope
 - kabhi-kabhi dwadash bhav se bhi naam or yash ke bare main pataa chalata he
 - Originally Chandrama and Venus are considered to be the best known planets
 - hastrekha vigyaan main surya ko yash kaa grah mana jaataa he
 - Saturn, Rahu and Bad Moon are planets in Yash
 - iske alaava kabhi-kabhi sangati se bhi apyash ke yoga ban jate hai
 When do you get fame in life? - Fourth, seventh and ninth house should be strong in one's horoscope
 - chandramaa yaa shukr main se koi ek kaaphi majboot ho
 - Panch Mahapurusha yoga in horoscope
 - kundali main gajakesari yoga ho
 - There is a double sun line in the hand or a triangle on the Sun Mount
 jivan main kab miltaa he apyash :- vyakti kaa surya yaa chandramaa grahan yoga main hone se apyash miltaa he
 - The eighth or twelfth sense of the horoscope is bad
 - kundali main shukr yaa chandramaa neech raashi main ho
 - The sun line is broken or there is an island on it
 - surya parvat par til yaa valay ho
 - The possibility of getting wastage increases to those living in dark house
 jivan main yash paane ke liye upaay :- subah uthakar sabase pehle apni hatheliyon ko dekhen
 After this, touch the feet of the parents and the elderly
 - roj subahasooryako jal chadhayen
 After this, chant the mantra 'un Bhaskarai Namah' 108 times
 - laal chandan kaa tilak apane kanth par lagaaein
 Remedy to avoid wastage: - Offer sindoor (chola) every Tuesday to Lord Hanuman
 - har subah shiv tandav stotra kaa paath karen
 - On Sunday, wear a copper sun in red thread and wear it around your neck
 - har amavasya ko chaaval, daal, aataa or kachi subjiyon kaa daan karen
 - Head towards east while sleeping

 bricks ne saath hi is aatankwaad kii buraai se prabhavi tareeke se nipatane ke liye bharat samarthit vaishvik sandhi kaa sanyukt raashtra se jald anumodan kaa aahvaan kiya
 PM Modi has raised the issue of terrorism loudly, in the BRICS Annual Conference of the BRICS, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, all countries have been called on to call for terrorism, violent extremism, fundamentalism, recruitment, foreign and other terrorists
 Adopt a comprehensive approach in disrupting activities and sources of financing terrorism
 samooh ne sabhi deshon se kaha ki ve saath milakar kaam karen jisase ki 'antarrashtriya aatankwaad par samgr samjhaute' (sisiaiti) kaa anumodan sanyukt raashtra main bina kisi or deree ke ho sake
 The Goa manifesto released at the end of the conference said, 'we strongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks against some BRICS countries, including India
 ham aatankwaad kii uske sabhi swaroopon ke saath kadi ninda karte hai or is baat par jor dete hai chaahe jo bhi ho kisi bhiaatankwaadi krityako kisi bhi tarah se uchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Whether it is based on any ideology, religious, political, racial, ethnic or any reason
 ' isamen kaha gaya, 'ham isse sahamat hai ki antarrashtriya aatankwaad ke khilaaf ladaai main sahyog majboot hona chahie jisamen dwipaksheeya or antarrashtriya manch donon hi str shaamil hai
 Emphasizing that crime should only be the basis for punitive action against individuals and organizations responsible for terrorist attacks, PM Modi said, 'finishing terrorists, supplying them weapons, training and ending political cooperation systematically should go
 ' unhone kaha ki aatankwaadiyon or sanghathanon ko lekar bhedbhaavpurn ruukh sirf anupayogi nahin hoga, balki iske vipareet parinaam honge
 The Prime Minister's statement that India objected to China's attitude towards terrorism has come against the backdrop of China's 'ban' when Masood Azhar was declared a global terrorist
 ajahar pathankot vayusena adde par aatanki hamale kaa mastermind he
 In the presence of BRICS leaders, Modi said, "it has been agreed that those who nurture, shelter, support and sponsor the forces of violence and terrorism pose as much of a threat to us as terrorists
" We do
 ' pradhanmantri ne kaha, 'jis duniya main aaj ham rahete hai vahaan agar hamen apane nagarikon ke jivan ko surakshit karnaa he to aatankwaad virdohi sahyog jaruri he
 Terrorism is a shadow of our development and economic prosperity '
 unhone kaha ki isaki pahunch ab vaishvik ho gai he
 In his bilateral meetings with Putin and Xi Jinping on Saturday, PM Modi strongly expressed India's concerns over terrorism emanating from Pakistani soil

 At the conclusion of the BRICS summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a statement, "we have agreed to expedite the establishment of a BRICS rating agency to further bridge the gap in the global financial structure
 ' bricks sadsy desh apane vitt poshan kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye pehle hi nav vikaas bank sthapit kar chuke hai
 The bank went into operation last year, before Navi Vikas Bank President KV Kamat advocating setting up of a new rating agency by the BRICS group as the ratings for the three major global rating agencies Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's
 There was concern about the methods and said that their rules are a hindrance to the path of growth in emerging countries'
 bhartiya niryaat aayaat bank ne bhi bricks deshon ke liye swatantra reating agency kii purajor vakaalat kii thi
 Not only this, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called on member countries to increase their inter-trade to $ 500 billion by 2020 before the conclusion of the BRICS summit

 ' rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav main ab zyada samay nahin rah gaya he, lekin rajya main sattarudh bijepi satta bachaae rakhane ke liye apni chunavi kasarat shuru nahin kar saki he kyonki vahaan par party ke pradesh adhyaksh kaa maamla sulajhane kaa naam hi nahin le rahaa
 And the reason for this is the tussle between the central and state level leadership on this issue
 bhartiya janata partike rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or rajya kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke bich hui baithak ke baavjood rajasthan ke pradesh adhyaksh ko lekar koi faisla nahin ho paaya
 Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje met Amit Shah with 10 big leaders of Rajasthan
 duusari ore, bijepi sutron kaa kahana he ki bijepi kekendriya netritvne yah saaf kar diya he ki wo rajasthan bijepi ke pradendhyaksh par kendriya mantri gajendra singh ko baitaane ke apane faisle par punarvichaar karne ke mood main nahin he
 Vasundhara may take more time to accept this decision
 tanaav barkaraarparty kii saarvajanik baithak memrajasthanmen chunaav jeetne ke tareekon par charchaa hui or uske baad vasundhara raaje or amit shah ne bijepi pradesh adhyaksh ke pad par naam tay karne ko lekar lambii baithak kii
 However, it is being told that so far both leaders are unable to agree on any one name
 vasundhara raaje or unke samarthak rajasthan sarkaar main shaamil mantri aaj bhi dilli main deraa daale hue hai
 PM Modi's choice is Gajendra Singhvsundhara faction people are trying to convince other big national leaders of BJP to convince that the choice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi Gajendra Singh is not right for the post of BJP State President of Rajasthan
 kendriya mantri gajendra singh bhi rajput hai or vasundhara raaje bhi jat or rajput samaaj donon se aati hai
 In such a situation, it is necessary to be the leader of another community for this post
 baithak main shaamil netaaon kaa kahana he ki bijepi ke rashtriya netaaon ne saaf kar diya he ki modi ke pasand kendriya mantri gajendra singh kaa virodh karne kii himmat kisi main nahin he, lihaaja vah apni ladaai khud laden
 Vasundhara Raje's fear is in the assembly elections in the state and in such a situation, the post of state president of BJP in Rajasthan is lying vacant for more than 60 days
 ab tak kisi ke bhi pradesh adhyaksh pad par niyukt nahin hone se chunavi ranneeti kii taiyaari bhi shuru nahin ho pai he or ab amit shah ke saath hui mulaakaat ke baad bhi faisla nahin hone se party ke kaaryakartaaon main bechaini he
 Vasundhara Raje is sitting in the mind that Gajendra Singh should not become a threat to them in any way
 vasundhara gut ko lagata he ki ho saktaa he ki party kaa sheersh kaman gajendra singh ko mukhyamantri ummidavaar ke rup main pesh kar de, lihaaja vah kabhi nahin chahengi ki centre kii taraf se koi thopa hua vyakti rajasthan main bijepi kaa pradesh adhyaksh bane
 The problem with central leaders is that he knows that there is no leader more popular than BJP in the state than Vasundhara Raje
 agar chunaav jeetna he to vasundhara hi bijepi kii naiya paar laga sakati hai
 Both know each other's shortcomings and merits, in such a case, the matter is equal and no one is getting heavy on each other

 " pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf vipaksh kaa cheharaa banane ke liye in dinon kai netaa jaddojahad kar rahe hai
 In this episode, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has declared a struggle against Modi and the Yogi government by taking the road
 akhilesh bharat chodo andolan kii 75veen varshgeth ke maukey par 9 agast se 'desh bachaao-desh banaao' abhiyaan kii shuruyaat kar rahe hai
 Through this movement, where they want to get back their lost political ground, on the other side there is also an attempt to emerge as the face of a strong opposition against Modi
 darasal pradhanmantri narendra modi ne pichley hafte hi man ke baat kaarykram main kaha tha ki agast kaa maheenaa ek tarah se kranti kaa maheenaa he
 This month should be celebrated as the month of revolution, so that the younger generation of the country can understand the revolution that took place for independence
 ek agast ko asahyog andolan or nau agast 1942 ko bharat chodo andolan kii shuru hua tha
 The country became independent on 15
 bharat chodo andolan kii 75veen varshganth he
 People joined this movement shoulder to shoulder against the British government and became part of the movement
 gandhiji ke kehane par lakhon log karo yaa maro ke naare par khud ko aazaadee ke liye jhonk rahe the
 Two forms of Bapu's movement appear in 1920 and 1942
 modi ke is agast kranti kaa jawaab main sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav modi or yogi sarkaar ke khilaaf kranti kaa naaraa buland kar rahe hai
 Through this movement, the election of SP 2019 is going on as a start
 janaadhar ko waapas laane kii koshish2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh yadav ko soobe main kaaphi karaari haar mili thi
 His party's base has shifted to the BJP camp
 aise main akhilesh yadav party kaaryakarta main nai jaan foonkkar dobaaraa se apane janaadhar ko waapas paanaa chaahate hai, taaki 2019 kii jang fatah kar saken
 In fact, there is no face of opposition against Narendra Modi in the current era, which can face Modi
 jabaki kuch samay pehle tak log nitish kumaar ko vipaksh ke chehre ke taur par dekh rahe the, lekin bhaajapa ke sang unke mil jane se ye jagah puri tarah se khaali he
 In such a situation, new hope has arisen among the leaders of regional satraps
 yahi vajah he ki mamata banerjee ne jahaan 9 agast ko agast kranti ke maukey par 'bhaajapa bhagaao' abhiyaan kaa aagaaj kar rahi hai
 So at the same time Akhilesh Yadav is going to start the 'save the country - make the country' campaign from 9 August
 akhilesh yadav is baat ko bakhubi samaj rahe hai ki wo modi ke khilaaf bigul foonkane main kaamyaab ho jate hai, to nishchat rup se wo vipaksh kaa ek majboot cheharaa ban jaaenge
 This is the reason why they have chosen the day of August revolution
 jiskaa sambandh sidhe desh kii aazaadee se he
 SP leaders are also assuming that Akhilesh Yadav is a leader of clean image, he has not done as much development work as the Chief Minister of UP for five years in any previous government
 sapa ke liye 2019 kaa chunavi aagaajasmajawaadee party ke pravaktaa rajendra choudhary ne ajtak daat in se kaha- modi sarkaar ne teen saal main desh kaa bedaa gark kar diya he
 The voice of disagreement is being suppressed by the BJP government in an undemocratic manner
 yogi raaj main kisaan tabah hai or mahilaayein asurakshit hai
 Not only this, the future of students and youth is also being played with
 unhone bataaya ki agast kranti diwas par janata kii aawaaj ko purajor dhang se uthaai jaaegi
 At all district headquarters of the state, SP workers will perform under the campaign 'save the country - make the country'
 akhilesh yadav faijabad main khud bhi hissaa lenge
 He said that through this the SP is making the election debut of 2019
 choudhary kehete hai ki yogi sarkaar ke chaar maheene abhi gujarey hai, lekin soobe kii awam akhilesh ke kaarykaal ko yaad karne lage hai

 Sai Shree, a 13-year-old girl, kept crying and crying for help from her father before she died
 
 And kept saying that Papa i am dying
 
 Please save me
 
 
 lekin uski yah karun vinati kaam na ai, aakhir usne dam tod diya
 
 marane se pehle apane papa se wo faryaad karti rahi
 
 apane zakhm dikhaati rahi
 
 apana dard sunaati rahi
 
 girgidaati rahi
 
 papa raham karo
 
 pleez mujhe bachaa lo
 
 varanaa main mar jaaoongi
 
 main bhi to aapaki beti hum naa
 
 magar na jane wo kaisaa pita tha
 
 na to wo use bachaane aayaa or na hi marane ke baad uske janaaze par aayaa
 He wrote, 'father, why are you not providing me treatment even though you have so much money? 
 i am your daughter too
 
 Do you not like me being alive? 
 Why do you want to kill me 
 The video of Sai Shree, this 13-year-old girl from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh has gone viral
 video main bacchee kar rahi he apane papa se fariyaad, papa mujhe cancer ho gaya he! pleez mujhe bachaa lo, varanaa main mar jaaoongi! mere jism par har jagah chhaale nikal aae hai
 Neither am i able to eat
 
 Neither drugs
 
 
 cancer kaa ilaaj na mil paane kii vajah se wo mar gai
 
 marane se pehle usne apane papa se ilaaj kii guhaar lagaai thi
 
 magar papa ne ilaaj karaane ke bajaae use or uski maa ko hi ghar se nikaal diya
 
 dard se tadap-tadap kar marane se pehle jab sai shri ko kahin se madad nahin mili to usne ye dard bhaar video banaaya
 Papa, you said that you have no money
 
 But we have this house
 
 Please sell this house and get my treatment done
 
 Because my condition is not well at all now
 
 If left untreated, i will not be able to live much longer
 
 Please save me
 
 i want to go to school 
 If anything happens to me, you will be responsible for my death
 sai shri kii mauhospataal main cansarka ilaaj na mil paane kii vajah se hui
 
 ab uskaa ye video soshal media par viral ho rahaa he
 
 magar afsos kii is video ko viral hone main thodaa vaqt laga or jab tak logon ko sai shri ke dard kaa pataa chalaa tab tak wo is duniya se ja chuki thi
 Sai Shree is saying in the video, 'papa, i have also got blisters in my mouth
 
 There are also blisters on the tongue
 
 i have not been able to eat properly for a week
 
 Everything i eat turns upside down
 
 Nothing is being digested
 
 Even now i am not able to eat medicine
 
 Please father come quickly and give me treatment
 
 Badnasib Sai Sri, who was asking for help, was not a father but was stoned
 
 And when his body refused to bear the pain of cancer, he gave up hope and by making this video he blamed his father for his death
 usne kaha, 'main police thane main or kamishnar ke paas bhi report karaayuungi, or sab ko main apana ye video bhejne ja rahi hum
 
 ye video dekhne ke baad agar aap do- teen din main nahin aae to meri maut ke aap hi zimmedaar honge
 
 ravivaar ko sai shri kii maut ho gai, jiske baad ek enjio ne sai shri kii shikaayat rajyamanvadhikaar ayogmein kii he
 The NGO alleges that the father did not treat the daughter despite the money and now under pressure from the local MLA, the police is refusing to even file a case against Sai Shree's father

 abhinetri rani mukherjee apni haalia pradarshit film 'mardaani' ko mil rahi pratikriyaaon se bhavvibhor hai
 She said that the film made about women's empowerment was successful in its intention to create awareness
 nagar nigam skulon kii chaatraon ke liye aatmaraksha ke upkarnon vaali ek dukaan ke shubharambh par shanivaar ko 36 varshiya rani ne kaha, main bahut zyada khush hum
 Reactions to the film have taken a beating
 rani ne kaha, duniyabar main logon ne film ko kaaphi pasand kiya
 They were standing and playing applause
 mujhe lagata he ki film ne bilkul sahi jagah par waar kiya
 He further said, Actually, the film was successful in the purpose we made this film
 'mardaani' team kii sadsy hone ke naate main darshakon kii shukraguzaar hum
 In 'mardaani', directed by Pradeep Sarkar, Rani played the role of police officer Shivani Shivaji Roy who waged a war against human traffickers
 supreme courtke paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth aadhaar, daagi netaaon ke chunaav ladane, samalangikta or sabarimala mandir main mahilaon ke pravesh jaise aath samvedansheel muddon par aaj se sunwaayee shuru karegi
 Our Constitution is silent on all these issues and the questions raised in the petitions
 chif justise deepak mishra kii aguwai vaali paanch jajon kii samvidhan peeth ke anya jajon main justise emen khanvilakar, justise divai chandrachud, justise ashok bhushan or justise eke sikri shaamil hai
 The controversy over the inclusion of senior judges in the Constitution Bench has no effect on it
 kyonkicharon varisht jajonmen se ek ko bhi is peeth main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Violation of privacy in Aadhaar? In the Aadhaar case, the petitioners are the Puttaswamy of the retired Justice of the High Court
 samvidhan peeth tay karegi ki kya aadhaar main di gai jaankaree kisi bhi naagarik ke niztaa ke adhikaar kaa ulanghan he? agar koi nijee company yaa sarkari upkram apane upabhoktaaon kaa aadhaar se hasil data li karti he to sajaa kaa praavdhaan kya hoga?samelingakta aparaadh yaa nahin?samvidhan peeth samalangikta ko aparaadh kii shrenee main laane vaali dhara 377 par court ke faisle kii samiksha bhi karegi
 Because this section of the IPC considers the physical relationship between two adult homosexuals a crime, while the advocates of modernity, rights of equality and freedom are calling for its abolition
 daagi netaaon kaa bhavishyasanvidhan peeth ke saamne ek or maamla chargeshited netaaon yaa janpratinidhiyon ke antim faisla aane tak chunaav ladane par roak lagane kaa bhi he
 The entry of women into the Sabarimala temple is also a matter of removing restrictions on entry of girls and women between 10 and 50 years of age into Kerala's famous Sabarimala temple
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki ye roak langik aadhaar par bhedbhaav he
 Whereas the proponents of this ban cite centuries-old tradition
 parsi mahila ke adhikarek or maamla parsi mahila ke gaiyr parsi se vivaah karne par dharm kii sthiti par vichaar karne kaa bhi he
 Right now women are denied religion and religious rights by marrying non-parsis
 yani vishesh vivaah kanoon ke praavdhaanon par court vichaar karegi
 a woman is also guilty of loyalty
 Adultery means that a man is considered a criminal in illicit relations with another woman while having a wife
 ipisi kii is dhara ko sanvaidhanik ghoshit karne ke supreme court ke purv ke faislon par phir se vichaar hoga
 Interestingly, years ago, Chief Justice YV Chandrachud had declared this section valid and said that it does not violate the constitution
 lekin usee ko chunauti dene vaali yachika ko justise vivi chandrachud ke bete or supreme court ke maujuuda jaj justise divai chandrachud ne is maamle par phir se vichaar ke liye sweekaar kiya he
 Consumer and Sales Tax Case The other two cases also include two petitions related to the deadline for answering in the consumer case and sales tax

 Former army chief General Bikram Singh, in a special conversation with Aaj Tak, completely denied the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir
 unka kahana he ki sijafire do mulkon ke bich main hota he na ki aatankiyon or sena ke bich main
 The ceasefire took place between India and Pakistan in 2002 and 2003
 us vakt do pradhanmantriyon ke bich main baatcheet hone ke baad jo dijiemo ne tay kiya tha, vah sijafire tha
 Bikram Singh said, we do not conduct any operation against the public
 ham chaahate hai ki janata ko kam se kam pareshaani ho
 May fulfill their traditions during Ramadan
 us dauraan jab ham oparation karte hai usamen ham kam se kam force kaa istemaal karte hai
 The former army chief said, terrorists provoke people
 kashmiri shantipriy hai ye baat main jaanata hum
 Pakistan is instigating them
 kashmir ghati main islamic bhavanaaen bhadakaai ja rahi hai
 People are being instigated by using social media in the name of Islamization
 purv sena pramukh ne aage kaha, ramajaan ke dauraan ham oparation ko sthagit nahin kar sakate
 Terrorists challenge our constitution
 sena ye kaise sweekaar kar sakati he
 The Indian Army has full respect for the people
 sabhi dharmon kii izzat karti he
 How will we leave the terrorists who have come from outside, who shoot and kill people? bikram singh ne kaha, aap puri duniya ke andar dekh lijie ramajaan maheene ke dauraan hi sabase zyada fidaayin hamale hote hai
 There is no question that the army will cease in this situation
 logon ko yah baat samajni chahie ki jo aatanki maare ja rahe hai unke khilaaf sthaneey log hi khabar de rahe hai
 Bikram Singh said, if these terrorists were Robinhood then why would any local report against them
 ham nahin chaahate ki ye hathiyaar uthaaen
 The local youth who are being misled have to bring us on the path of peace
 ham unhen oparation ke dauraan bhi laudspikar se chetavanee dekar bachaane kaa kaam karte hai
 But in spite of that, if they do not keep weapons, then the army has no other option
 general bikram singh ne sena pramukh general bipin ravat kii baat kaa samarthan karte hue kaha ki kashmir main aazaadee kaa koi sawaal hi nahin he
 The Indian Army is working for the entirety of the country
 koi bhi sena is aazaadee ko nahin maan sakati
 This is a dream that they should forget and this dream is being shown by Pakistanis

 com / plighhfg8i Explain that ISRO launched 'chandrayaan 1' 11 years ago
 iskaa kaarykaal 312 din kaa tha or yah 29 agast, 2019 tak karyrat tha
 Chandrayaan 2 is equipped with an arbiter, lander and rover and is expected to land on the moon in the first week of September
 vaigyanik ise chandramaa ke dakshini dhruv par maddhim dhang se utaaregaa
 No country has reached this region so far
 china, rus or america ke baad bharat aisa chauthaa desh hoga jo chand par soft landing ke jariye rover ko utaaregaa
 Chandrayaan-2, isro's most complex and prestigious mission since its launch, is being considered
 ' The old settlements have emerged as a torch of success in the dusty lanes of Srinagar, in the industry of cricket bats which is dominated by men
 phir aisa kyon na ho ki ve unhen pyaar-se "batwooman'' kehane lage hai
 Rifat, a mother of two, started the work in 2003
 teen saal pehle unke sasur kii maut ke baad 40 saal puraani bat manuphaccharing unit masudi arts and sports par taale pad chuke the
 "I asked my husband Shaukat if i could start it again and they agreed
" ''shaukat ne puraane kaam karne waalon, wilo (lakdi ke dealron) or jammu-kashmir se baahar ke graahakon se unka sampark kaayam karavaaya
 Initially there were problems like delay in delivery and payment of goods
 maddhim raushnee vaale kamare, jisaki mitti kii deevaaron ke saath glouci phinishd emeyes (masudi arts and sports) ballon kaa ambara laga tha, main baithi rifat kahati hai, "magar workaron ne meri bahut madad kii or mujhe vah banaaya jo main aaj hum
 "rifat says that making a bat" requires skills like a goldsmith ", you should know once the bat is gold or rubbish
 ve harek taiyaar balle kii khud jaanch karti hai
 Riyaz Ahmed Ghani had been working in this bat unit for more than two decades, when a three-year detainee forced him to return to the village and do minor jobs
 ab jab rifat ne kaarobaar phir khadaa kar liya he, to ve khush hai or is baat ke liye shukraguzaar bhi ki "unke bacchon kii talim main khalal nahin padaa
 "they say," This is not their success alone, but ours too
 ''start-ap ko badhaava dene ke kaam se jude rajya sarkaar ke ek afasar kehete hai ki sarkarein is udyog ko praathamikta dene or duniya main kashmiri ballon kii baari maang kaa phayda uthaane main naakaam rahi hai
 He says, "kashmiri brand bats are rarely seen in national and international markets
 ghati se kachche balle gaiyrkanoonee tareekon se duusare rajyon main le jaae jate hai jahaan pramukh brand un par apane stikar lagaate hai
 "that is the reason why Rifat lets out only a fully prepared bat so that his brand, MAS Bats, will illuminate the name of Kashmir

 All-rounder cricketer Yuvraj is not in the Indian team playing Singhworld Cup
 yah unke lakhon prashansakon ke liye behad dukhad he
 Indians were always expected from this talented player
 lekin chayankartaaon ne unhen nahin chunaa
 He was not among the 30 players selected for the World Cup anyway
 lekin pichley dinon gharelu cricket main unke laajawab pradarshan ke baad ummiden jag gai thim
 It was felt that with his return to form, he will also return to the team
 yuvaraj singh (33) ne bharat ko world cap sahit kai mahatvapurn match jitaane main badi bhoomika nibhaai thi
 But there were many reasons why this brilliant player did not get a place in the team
 1
 Yuvraj's performance in ODI cricket was disappointing
 unhone apane antim 20 maichon main mahaj ek shatak or do ardhashatak lagaae the
 This seemed to end their magical touch
 2
 They did not have the same concentration as before
 pehle vah jis tarah se khel par apana dhyaan kendrit karte the, ab unamem vah baat nahin rahi
 His confidence was ending
 3
 His bowling edge was also ending
 vah pehle jaisi gendbaaji bhi nahin kar paa rahe the
 By the way, he did a good deal against Saurashtra
 unhen vanade main hameshaa ek achche olerounder ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 4
 yuvaraj cancer kii ghaatak beemaari se ubar gaye hai, lekin durbhagyavash uskaa asar un par dikhataa he
 They do not look as agile as before
 unhone jabardast practice karke apni sehat or khel donon main sudhaar kiya he
 But its effect is visible
 5
 Ravindra Jadeja has replaced Yuvraj
 un par captain dhoni kaa vishwaas he
 Jadeja can do better in Dhoni's eyes
 bisisiai ko bhi jadeja par yuvaraj se kahin zyada vishwaas rahaa
 Jadeja can play for a long time, while Yuvraj's career is nearing completion
 jadeja kii umr kam he or vah lambey samay tak team main bane rah sakate hai
 6
 beemaari ke baad vaapasi kar rahe yuvaraj kii takanic or riflex main bhi kami aa gai he
 He starts batting in front of the rising fast balls and similar balls will be found in Australia because the wickets are bouncing there
 7
 His fitness is also not the same and his weight also looks increased, which is probably the effect of medicines
 aise main un par daanv khelnaa jokhim bharaa ho saktaa tha
 In cricket or any sport, new players are given more preference so that the strength of the team remains in the future
 yuvaraj kaa itihaas shandaar rahaa, lekin ab team ko unki jarurat nahin he
 As the Lok Sabha elections close to the sixth phase, a new study report has been released, which states that in the last five years the total amount spent in various elections in the country was more than Rs 1
5 lakh crore and out of this More than half of the money came from unaccounted sources

 Starting on April 7, this election will run till May 12
 abhi tak paanch charnon main 232 loksabhaa siton par matdaan ho chuke hai, jabaki baaki chaar charan main 311 siton par matdaan hone hai
 During this time, the Election Commission has intensified surveillance on the use of black money and recovered large amounts of cash and other restricted items across the country
 siemes ke adhyayan ke mutabik pichley paanch saal main bharat main kai chunaavon ke dauraan 1,50,000 karod rupee se adhik dhan kharch kiya gaya
 Thirty thousand crore rupees spent on Lok Sabha electionscms chairman N
 bhaskar raav ne bataaya ki yah ek motaa anumaan he
 More than half of this huge amount is black money
 chunaavon ke liye kaledhan kaa istemaal hamaare desh main sabhi bhrashtachar kii janani he
 The report said that out of Rs 1
5 lakh crore, 20 percent or Rs 30,000 crore is estimated to be spent in the current Lok Sabha elections
 is kul raashi kaa ek tihaai yaa 45,000 se 50,000 karod rupee rajyon ke vidhaan sabha chunaavon main kharch kiye gaye
 Ten thousand crore rupees on the Zilla Parishad elections, according to the expenditure report, about Rs 30,000 crore was spent on the elections to the panchayats, Rs 20,000 crore for the mandals, Rs 15,000 crore for the municipal corporations and Rs 10,000 crore for the district councils
 report main kaha gaya he ki loksabhaa chunaavon main media prachaar abhiyaan (25 pratishat) or sattarudh partiyon dwaara chunaav purv kharch (20 se 25 pratishat) kaa isamen ahm hissaa he
 Spending on media in small elections also makes things different in small elections, according to the study
 media par kharch bahut kam hota he or mandalon va panchayaton main reliyon par kharch ek tarah se na ke baraabar hota he
 He claimed that spending by political parties in local elections is less than 10 percent, while in Lok Sabha elections it is 20 percent
 vahiin duusari ore, loksabhaa ke maamle main ummidavaar dwaara party tikat hasil karne ke liye bahut adhik dhan kharch kiya jaataa he
 a video of Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Bala Bachchan is going viral on social media these days, in which he is talking about giving scheme money to people in the name of joining Congress

 "in the video, he said," We got 50 - 50 crore roads approved, where 600 - 700 votes were won

 In fact, his elder sister and the then Vasavi Gram Panchayat Sarpanch Tarabai is involved in a case of corruption
 unke sarpanch rahete hue vahaan shauchalay nirmaan main dhaandhlee kii shikaayat mili thi
 After that, the allegations were proved true in the investigation

 Apart from this, Delhi Daredevils have also decided to release some of their foreign players and Robin Bist, who scored the most runs in the Ranji Trophy last season
 adhikansh frenchygiyon ne abhi apane pattey nahin khole hai or bade khilaadiyon ko apane saath barkaraar rakhane ko taiyaar hai
 The defending IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders are not releasing any of their top players while the Daredevils are set to retain their top six overseas players Mahela Jayawardene, Kevin Pietersen, Morne Morkel, David Warner, Andre Russell and Ross Taylor
 dairedevills kii team main shaamil bisht ko ek bhi match khilne kaa mauka nahin mila kyonki unhen khel ke lambey praaroop ke liye upyukt mana jaataa he
 Apart from the 15-member Champions League T20 squad, Yogesh Nagar, Puneet Bisht, Shahbaz Nadeem and Manpreet Juneja also went to South Africa with the Delhi team but by not including Robin in the squad, the team management indicated what they would do about them
 Think

 aisa sthanon se lekar unki savaariyon tak ke saath he
 Have you noticed why a god chose that special ride for himself
 masalan vishnu bhagwaan garud kii sawari karte hai to indra dev airavat hathi par aate hai
 In the same way, Maa Laxmi's vehicle is Ulu, then mother Durga rides a lion
 lekin aakhir kyon sarvashaktimaan bhagavaanon ko in savaariyon kii aavashyaktaa padi, jabaki ve to apni divyashaktiyon se palabar main kahin bhi aa-ja sakate hai?iske peeche aadhyatmik, vaigyanik or vyavhaarik kaaran hai
 Let's know how
 
 
 bhagwaan vishnu or garudagarud pratik he divya shaktiyon or adhikaar kaa
 It is said in the Bhagavad Gita that Lord Vishnu has the whole world
 sunahare rang kaa bade aakaar kaa yah pakshi bhi isi ore sanket karata he
 It is the most perfect symbol for the divinity and authority of Lord Vishnu
 bhagwaan ganesh or mushakaganesh ji kaa vaahan he mooshak
 The word Mushak is derived from the Sanskrit musha which means rob or steal
 sankethik rup se manushya kaa dimag churaane vaale yani chuuhe jaisaa hi hota he
 It is surrounded by selfishness
 ganesh ji kaa chuuhe par baithna is baat kaa sanket he ki unhone swaarth par vijay pai he aurajnakalyaan ke bhav ko apane bheetar jaagrit kiya he
 Shiva and Nandishiva Bholebhale are straight-moving but sometimes fiercely angry gods, their vehicles are Nandi, ie bull
 yah shakti, aasthaa va bharose kaa pratik hota he
 Apart from this, the character of Lord Shiva is said to be Moh Maya and living beyond material desires
 bail yani nandi in visheshtaon ko puri tarah charitaarth karte hai or isliye shiv ke vaahan hai
 Mayur is the vehicle of Karthikeya and Mayurakartikeya
 ek katha ke anusaar yah vaahan unako bhagwaan vishnu se bhent main mila tha
 Lord Vishnu, seeing Karthikeya's seeker abilities, gave him this vehicle, which signified that Karthikeya had taken his playful mind as a peacock
 maa durga or sherdurga tej, shakti or samarthy kii pratik hai to unke saath singh he
 The lion symbolizes aggression and bravery
 yah teenon visheshtaayen maa durga ke aacharan main bhi dekhne ko milti he
 It is also interesting that the roar of a lion is considered to be the sound of Mother Durga, beyond which all the other voices of the world seem weak
 maa saraswati or hansahans ko pavitrataa or jigyaasa kaa pratik mana gaya he jo gyaan kii devi maa saraswati ke liye sabase behatar vaahan he
 Mother Saraswati sitting on the swan suggests that curiosity can be pacified by knowledge and purity can be kept intact
 maa lakshmi or ulluma lakshmi ke vaahan ullu ko sabase ajeeb chayan mana jaataa he
 It is said that the owl is not able to see properly, but it only happens during the day
 ullu shubh samay or dhan-sampatti ke pratik hote hai
 Opposition to Padmavat continues in Rajasthan
 supreme court dwaara bain par roak ke baavjood karani sena lagaataar pradarshan kar rahi he

 He said that apart from 4 states, Karni Sena has been considered for ban by other states

 Using public restrooms is nothing short of a challenge in itself
 dam ghont dene vaali badboo, ankhen band karne ke liye majaboor kar dene vaali gandagi
 To use public restrooms means to invite diseases
 baavjood iske kabhi na kabhi majaburi main hi sahi ham sabhi ko public toilet yuj karnaa hi padataa he
 If someone flushes the toilet seat before using it, then someone sits on the entire seat by laying tissue paper
 agar aap bhi kuch aisa hi karte hai to aapako bataa den ki aisa karnaapake liye khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 While laying toilet paper on the seat, we think that it will not cause infection, but it is wrong to think so
 hafington post kii ek khabar ke anusaar, toilet seat par toilet paper bichhaakar baithne se infections kaa khatra kam nahin hota he
 According to this report, laying toilet paper greatly increases the chances of bacteria accumulating
 aise main paper bichhaakar aap sirf or sirf bacteria ko nyotaa dene kaa kaam karte hai
 As many bacteria are on the toilet seat, they are also on the flush handle
 toilet seat ko chikna or ghumaavdaar banane ke peeche bhi yahi soch he taaki is par bacteria kam chipken
 When we sit on the toilet seat by laying toilet paper, a large number of bacteria accumulate in it
 jisase sankraman hone kaa khatra kai guna bad jaataa he
 In such a situation, those using public restrooms are advised not to forget to flush before using the restroom
 iske alaava toilet ke baad haathon ko acchhee tarah se dhoen
 Wipe hands with paper towels
 electric hand dryer yuj karnaa sahi nahin he
 This can cause bacterial infection as well as viral particles can also enter the body by flying
