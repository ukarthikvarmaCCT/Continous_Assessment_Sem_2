 Nitish Kumar's JDU has also spoken of supporting Ramnath Kovind for the President
 nitish kumaar ke ghar par is babat faisla liya gaya
 After this stand of JDU, the opposition has received a shock, which was thinking of taking down its candidate
 jediu ne yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki vah guuruuvaar ko hone vaali vipaksh dalon kii baithak main hissaa nahin legi
 BJP has elected former Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind as its candidate
 nitish kumaar ne nishpaksh rajyapal ke rup main seva karne ke liye kovind ke kaarykaal ke dauraan kaaphi prashansa kii he
 Ramnath Kovind has been a prominent face of the Dalit community
 unhen 2015 main bihar kaa governor banaakar bheja gaya gaya
 However, when Ramnath Kovind was sent to Bihar, he was not consulted
 lekin baad main donon ke bich saath kaam karte hue acha rishta viksit ho gaya tha
 Therefore, one reason for Nitish's support is also being mentioned
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki ramnath kovind ke naam kii ghoshnaa hote hi nitish kumaar unase milane pahunche the
 However, the ally RJD has decided not to support Ramnath Kovind
 rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kii ore se raashtrapati pad ke pratyaashee banaae gaye ramnath kovind ko bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar dwaara samarthan die jane kii baat kehane par bhartiya communist party (sipiai) netaa di raja ne NDTV se kaha, "agar nitish (kumaar) ne (ramnath) kovind kaa samarthan karne kaa faisla kiya he, to yah hamaare liye setbac (jhatka) he
 
 
 In the last meeting of Sonia (gandhi), 17 opposition (opposition) parties had come
 
 
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki kal kitni partiyaan aati hai
 
 
 "comments ullekhneey he ki bihar ke rajyapal ramnath kovind ko endie kii ore se raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiye jane ke baad mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne rajbhavan pahunchakar unase mulaakaat kii thi
 After meeting Kovind, Nitish had said that it is a matter of personal pleasure for me that the Governor of Bihar has been declared the presidential candidate of the country
 pradesh ke rajyapal ke rup main unhone bahut hi behtareen kaary kiya
 It is heartening that they have been declared presidential candidates, so i was duty bound to meet my Governor as Chief Minister
 main apana sammaan prakat karne ke liye unase mila hum
 Asked on the day whether Ramnath Kovind had the support of the JDU as a presidential candidate, Nitish said that it was not appropriate to answer these questions
 bijepi ne bihar ke purv rajyapal ramnath kovind ko apana pratyaashee chunaa he
 Nitish Kumar has earned much acclaim during Kovind's tenure for serving as an impartial governor
 ramnath kovind dalit samudaay kaa pramukh cheharaa rahe hai
 He was sent as the Governor of Bihar in 2015
 haalanki jab ramnath kovind ko bihar bheja gaya tha to unase koi paraamarsh nahin liya gaya tha
 But later the two developed a good relationship working together
 isliye nitish ke samarthan kii ek vajah yah bhi bataai ja rahi he
 Perhaps this was the reason that Nitish Kumar came to meet him as soon as Ramnath Kovind's name was announced
 haalanki sahyogi argedy ne ramnath kovind kaa samarthan na karne kaa faisla kiya hua he
 Communist Party of India (CPI) leader d Raja told NDTV when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) President Ram Nath Kovind was supported by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, saying, "if Nitish (kumar) ) Has decided to support (ramnath) Kovind, so this is a setback (setback) for us

 Now we have to see how many parties come tomorrow
 
 
 " tippaniyan It is noteworthy that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar reached Raj Bhavan after Bihar Governor Ramnath Kovind was declared the presidential candidate by the NDA
 nitish ne kovind se mulaakaat ke baad kaha tha ki mere liye vyaktigat taur par yah prasannataa kii baat he ki bihar ke rajyapal desh ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ghoshit hue hai
 He did a very good job as the Governor of the state
 yah khushi kii baat he ki ve raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ghoshit hue hai, isliye meraa ferj banataa tha ki mukhyamantri ke rup main apane rajyapal se miluun
 i have met him to express my respect
 us din yah puche jane par ki kya ramnath kovind ko raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par jediu kaa samarthan he, nitish ne kaha tha ki in prashnon kaa uttar poochna abhi munasib nahin he

 Earlier on June 1, Law Minister of Karnataka Government TB Jayachandra said that the cabinet has decided to go to the Supreme Court against Nayalalithaa
 kya tha hai court kaa faislagauratlab he ki 11 may ke faisle main jayalalita ko karnataka hoicourtne 19 saal puraane aay se adhik sampatti ke maamle main sabhi aaropon se bari kar diya tha
 His close aide Sasikala Natarajan and three other friends were also given a clean chit by the High Court
 agar sab kuch thik rahaa to dwadash jyortelingon main se ek shri kedarnath dham kii yatra main na to mausam khalal paidaa kar sakegaa or na hi helicopteron kii dhamachaukadi se kedarnath wild life centuri ke vanya jeevon ko koi pareshaani aegi
 Ropeway will now be constructed for Kedarnapuri in Kedarnath
 ropave ke liye 2015 main survey kiya gaya tha
 a ropeway is proposed from Lincholi to Kedarnath in the first phase and Rambara to Lincholi in the next phase
 yatra main hogi aasaanikarib 11 kimi lambey in ropave ke astitv main aane se gaurikund sekedarnathtak kaa safar ek ghante main tay ho jayega, jabaki abhi tak is duuri ko paidal naapane main saat ghante lagate hai
 Although helicopter is its option, many passengers are not able to travel through it due to its high fare
 ropave banane se shraddhalujan kisi bhi mausam main aasaani se or kam kiraaye par baba kedaar ke darshanon ko pahunch sakenge
 Work will be done in 2 phases After the disaster of 2013, the demand for ropeway construction for Kedarpuri has gained momentum
 2014 main tatkaaleen sarkaar ne do charnon main ropave kii manjuuri dene ke saath hi 80 karod rupee kaa bajet sweekrut kiya tha
 After this, the tourism department invited tenders twice, but none of the companies took interest
 natijatan, baat aage nahin bad pai
 After this, a survey was conducted from Lincholi to Kedarnath in 2015 and Rambara to Linchauli in 2016 but the matter did not progress further
 is bich kedarnath ke liye helicopteron kaa aana-janaa bhi khub hone laga
 On this, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) conducted a study in view of the impact of wildlife on the flight of helicopters in the Wildlife Century near Kedarnath
 dablyooiai ne apni report main kedarnath ke liye heli sevaaon ko niyantrit karne or iske vikalp ke rup main ropave kaa suzav shashan ko diya
 Once again, the NGT has questioned the helicopter service of Kedarnath, then there is a serious churn on the option of ropeway

 On Monday, 25 November, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav also called on Chaudhary of the riot accused Balian Khap and Naresh Tikait, leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, from the other side
 tikait ke sahare dangon ke itar pashchimi upi main kisaanon kii naaraazgi bhi dur karne kii koshish hui
 On Tikait's demand, the Chief Minister assured that the government would consider returning the cases filed under the Kisan agitation

 Naresh Tikait said that he demanded to increase the support price of sugarcane to Rs 300 like Haryana and Uttarakhand

 At the same time, opposition to Jasmin's move has also started

 After Bulandshahr, angry BJP leaders were seen raging on the police after traffic challans were cut in Meerut
 bijepi parshad aashu rastogi ne bete kii skuti kaa chaalaan kaate jane par esao dhanvir singh ko naa sirf khari khoti sunai balki hosh main aane kii dhauns bhi de daali
 The video of the incident on Wednesday went viral on social media
 isamen aashu rastogi ko oonchi aawaaj main sio ko bhala-bura kehete dekha ja saktaa he
 Recently a similar incident took place in Siana district of Bulandshahr
 vahaan bijepi jila panchayat sadsy ke pati pramod lodhi kaa trephic niyamon ke ulanghan ke aarope main bike kaa chaalaan kaate jane par parshad samarthakon ne police upaadheekshak shrestha singh se khub takaraar kii thi
 But Shrestha refused to bow down to the pressure and said that if someone violates the rules then action will be taken against him
 ye baad alag he ki kuch hi din main routine tabadalon main shrestha kaa tabadalaa bhi baharich ho gaya
 SO Dhanveer Singh was checking on Wednesday near Surajkund intersection in Thana Civil Lines area of meerut
 tabhi parshad aashu rastogi kaa betaa shubh rastogi tution pard kar piel sharma road se skuti par laut rahaa tha
 He also had two friends with him
 ye teenon do skuti par savaar the
 SO Dhanveer Singh, acting SO of Civil Lines Police Station near Sitaram Pulia, stopped him and asked for scooty papers
 shubh ke paas kaagaj nahin the
 When the SO talked about cutting the challan, he tried to pressure him by citing good councilor father
 shubh ne pita aashu rastogi ko phone kar bula liya
 Ashu Rastogi, along with his supporters, reached the spot and started harassing Dhanvir Singh
 isi takaraar kaa video soshal media par viral ho gaya
 It is alleged that the SO was also threatened to take off and transfer the uniform
 tikhi jhadap ke dauraan parshad aashu rastogi ne yahaan tak kaha ki chor to pakade nahin jate, bas bacchon ko bevajaah pareshaan kiya jaataa he
 The councilor also accused him of asking for bribe
 parshad kaa ye bhi kahana tha ki shubh kii skuti main kagajaat kii photo copy rakhi hui thi
 Which SO refused to accept
 aashu rastogi ke mutabik unhone vardi utaravane aurtransfar karanejaisi koi baat nahin kii, ulte esao ne hi unke saath abhadrata kii
 According to SO Dhanvir Singh, a car driver had complained to him that three boys on two scooties were making fun
 saath hi wo takaraate-takaraate bhi bache hai
 When he was stopped, he did not have papers, so his challan was cut
 camere ke saamne esao dhanvir singh se ghatana ke bare main jab poocha gaya to unhone chuppi saadhe rakhana hi behatar samajha
 Even after seven decades of the country's independence, the government is now right in the claim, saying that it has electrified all the villages of the country
 lekin dilachasp hoga yah jaananaa ki gaanvon ko vidyutikrut karne kaa kya arth he?puure bharat main, kul gharon (houseold) kii sankhya 17
 99 crores
 lekin taaja aankade bataate hai ki desh ke 3
 Up to 14 crore homes (even after the claim that all villages have been electrified) have no electricity
 yah desh ke kul gharon kaa kariban 17 fisadi he
 After all, where did this decrease in access to electricity come from? The answer is found in the definition of electrification given in the Rural Electrification Policy, 2006
 jiske mutabik, kisi gaanv ko vidyutikrut mana jayega agar, vahaan vitaran transformar or pareshan linon jaisi buniyadi dhaanche lagaae ja chuke hon or us basti main dalit basti ko shaamil kiya gaya ho, saath hi, is buniyadi dhaanche ke jariye gaanv yaa basti ke das fisadi gharon main bijli pahunchaai ja saki ho
 Uttar Pradesh is at the top in terms of number of houses without electricity
 ab jaraa un rajyon kii fehrist par najar daaliye, jo 2018 ke april maheene ke aakhri taarikh tak bina bijli kii suvidha vaale gharon kii sankhya ke hisaab se badtareen fehrist main oonche paaydaanon par hai

 If you understand the gesture of the Election Commission, elections in Uttar Pradesh can be held by early next year
 lakhanu main chunaav ayog kii do dinon kii marathon baithkon ke baad mukhya chunaav ayukta naseem zadi ne kaha- 'vaise to har haal main may se pehle chunaav ho jaaenge lekin koshish ye he ki chunaav aise vakt ho jisase farvari or march main hone vaali pariksha par koi asar naa pade'
 The school examinations are held in february-march, in such a situation, it is expected that the commission can take the decision of conducting elections before this also
 pichley do dinon sechunaavayog ne sabhipartyonse bhi samay ko lekar raay maangi thi or lagbhag sabhi rajnatik partiyon ne chunaav ayog ko suzav diya he ki matdaan aise vakt ho jisase bacchon kii pariksha par asar na pade
 Although there is doubt about the date, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has already predicted the election
 chunaav ayog ke samiksha kii mukhya baaten:---ummidavaaron ke parchaa bharne se pehle hi kendriya suraksha bal kii tainaati ho jaaegi
 Till now, paramilitary forces were used only during voting
 -is baar 75 pratishat matdaan kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya he
 The Election Commission is eyeing the police stations of UP
 -ayog ko is baat kii bhi shikaayat mili he ki adhiktar thanedaar ek khaas jati ke hai
 The Chief Election Commissioner has sought a list of all the Thanedars from the DGP of UP and has said that only Inspector rank police officers should be made SHO

 abhi bhi priharvind kejarivaljab pehali baar ye khabar mili thi ki tum nai dilli vidhansabha kshetra main shila dikshit se aage chal rahe ho, to aisi hulus kar khushi hui thi ki jaisi 77 main indira gandhi kii rajanarayan ke haathon haar par mere baba ko hui hogi
 But seeing what is happening after that, it seems like Suraj is stuck in the hall due to Barjatya's picture
 film acchhee he, gane hai, ection ho chukaa he, drama bhi he
 But it is so long that the mind is grinning when it will end and some fresh air comes
 khayr, main aapako apni hi sunaata hum
 i come to the office by train
 metro vaali train
 Before the election, whenever someone asks in that train, what is the atmosphere
 zyaadaatar kehete, is baar to jhaadu he
 Hearing sounds good
 phir jab chunaav aae, to laga ki survey jhuthe the, metro par savaar janata sachhee thi
 But now everyone roars in the same train, why don't they form the Kejriwal government
 or haa sar ji
 Electricity bills still remain inflated
 meraa swaarth kuch chota tha
 i used to think that if the broom comes, i will also cure Mangu Singh
 mongu singh jab se dilli metro ke head bane hai ye train bahut ruk rukkar chalane lagi he
 But what is this aap bhi metro se sitamagar nikle
 Are not moving bas kuch khiskate hai, chalane kaa bharam dete hai or chinchinyaa ke phir ruk jate hai
 You said, we will sit in opposition
 hamane kaha, swaagat he, satta sanbhaalane kaa janadesh bhi nahin mila
 Then after seeing the final picture, it seemed that only one appearance is made
 bijepi aapke saath or congress bijepi ke saath kisi bhi keemat par nahin aa sakati
 It would have been a case of horse and grass carving
 to aap sarkaar banaate or iske liye congress baahar se samarthan ko taiyaar ho gai
 The BJP also spoke of constructive cooperation
 hamaare kanpur kii kahawat sa maamla tha ye aapke liye
 My mind too, my plate anta mere baap kaa
 But in the face of becoming everyone's father, you could not show political forward-looking

 Wrote a letter to both parties and said that you are supporting, but first answer these 18 issues

 This is called taking work by snatching
 baharhaal, ye tamaasha bhi puraa hua or iske baad ab aap kah rahe hai ki dilli kii janata se puuchhenge
 How to ask chitthee likhenge, puri 25 lakh
 Gabbar feel comes on hearing
 magar is chitthee kaa sandesh na pahunchaa to

 But before that, how much will you give, will make you wait
 aapaki party ke 'digg'ja kumaar vishwaas kehete hai ki yahi loktantr he
 So tell me one sir, how many times you will avoid many decisions in the name of going to the public
 ek udhaaharan se baat samajhate hai
 You say that 700 liters of water will be given free to all
 aap siem ban gaye or jal athurity waalon ke saath meeting kii
 Experts also sat and in the last it was said that not 700, but 650 liters of water can be given
 tab aap phir chitthee likhenge, esemes karenge or voting karavaaenge ki hamane to 700 kaha tha, par ab 650 hi de paa rahe hai, den ki na den
 Means will go to the public for every decision
 aap ise swaraj kah sakate hai, loktantr kii majbootee kah sakate hai
 But my understanding says that if the thing had to be decided by raising hands, then the practice of sati would never have gone out of this country

 Did not fulfill the promise of reducing inflation in 100 days

 At first our ancestors used to accept all your lies

 Your hollow, false propaganda is not going to accept this country
 meharbaani karke chhattisgarh ke matadaataaon kii ankhon main dhul jhonknaa band karo
 Modi once again promised that after coming to power at the Center, his government will bring back every pie of black money
 'khambhe se camel utaar do, fark nahin padegaa'bhaashan ke bich main achaanak bheed ko sambodhit karte hue modi ne logon se jhanda neeche karne ko kaha, taaki peeche khadey log bhi manch tak dekh saken

 But the people of Chhattisgarh brought such a doctor, who cured all the diseases of the child and made the child strong in 10 years
 ''tata-birla ko nahin sarkaar kii jarurat'jagadalpur kii tarah yahaan bhi modi ke bhaashan ke centre main garib, adivasee, dalit or pichde hi rahe
 Raising the slogan of development politics, he said, 'the government needs the poor man
 tata-birla ko sarkaar kii jarurat he kya?'
 Praising the CM of Chhattisgarh, Modi said, 'the more i congratulate Raman Singh, the less
 lekin usase zyada yahaan ke logon, daliton, adivaasiyon or pichhadon kaa abhinandan karnaa chahta hum jinhone congress kii baton main aae bina rajya ke bhale ke bare main sochaa
 "raman Singh has received awards from Manmohan" Hathi Modi also reminded that Raman Singh has worked in the most difficult circumstances and received awards from the Manmohan government of the Center
 unhone kaha, 'bahut mukhyamantri aate hai, par dil main jagah banane vaale kam aate hai
 Today, if you ask any man from Chhattisgarh, he says that our Chief Minister is a rice-baba
 ''hamase pucho garibi kya he'modi ne rahul gandhi ke bayaan par bhi tikhaa kataaksh kiya

 We spent our lives in poverty

 bade bhai kii madad se anil ambani 462 karod rupee kaa bakaayaa chukaa kar giraftaar se to batch gaye hai, lekin sach to yah he ki aage unki dikkatein aasaani se kam hone vaali nahin hai
 The total debt burden of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) stood at Rs 1,03,158 crore till the end of the last financial year i
e
 March, 2018 and the interest liability on it was also close to Rs 10 thousand crore

 The group's official figures for this financial year have not been released yet, but according to some estimates, by September 2018, the debt of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) has increased to around 1
 72 lakh karod rupee tak pahunch gaya he
 Significantly, Anil Ambani has paid the dues of Rs 550 crore to Sweden's telecom equipment maker Ericsson
 lekin ye paise unhone apane bade bhai mukesh ambani se lekar chukaaye hai
 If the company fails to do so, rcom chairman Anil Ambani could have to undergo a jail term of 3 months
 aise main madad ke liye bade bhai mukesh ambani saamne aae
 What was the matter of 462 crores? In 2013, rcom had signed a Multi Year Managed Services Agreement (MSA) with Ericsson
 lekin teen saal main hi bakaayaa rakam ko lekar donon companiyon ke rishton main khatas aa gai
 In September 2017, Ericsson canceled the agreement and reached the court of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover its dues of around Rs 1,100 crore
 may 2018 main ensielti ke aadesh ke baad arcom setlement ke rup main 550 karod rupee dene par sahamat hui
 The case reached the Supreme Court and ordered to give Rs 550 crore by September 30, 2018
 oktober tak jab orcom ne paisa nahin diya to arikson ne court kii avmaananaa kaa maamla darj kiya
 The Supreme Court fixed the last date till March 19, 2019
 company ne isamen se pehle kareeb 118 karod rupee (byaaj or jurmaane sahit) supreme court main jamaa kar die the
 The Supreme Court warned that if Anil Ambani did not pay the arrears, he could be jailed for three months
 lekin 18 march ko anil ambani ne apane bade bhai kii madad se 462 karod rupee chukaa diya
 Debt will be reduced by half after selling assets! The group plans to repay about 60 per cent of the debt by selling its assets
 yojana ke mutabik asset bikri se samooh kaa kul karj ghatakar 48,645 karod rupee rah jayega
 The group's telecom company Reliance Communications (rcom) alone owes about Rs 47,000 crore of debt to 38 defaulters and is going through a debt restructuring process
 company apana spectrum, fibre, telecom tower, aadi bechakar kareeb 25,000 karod rupee jutaney kii ummid kar rahi he
 Similarly, selling 125 acres of this company's Navi Mumbai property can fetch around Rs 10,000 crore

 To repay this, the company is going through an insolvency process
 arcom pehle se hi telecom market main kuch khaas nahin kar paa rahi thi, lekin jeeyo ke aane ke baad to yah puri tarah barbaad hi ho gai
 His elder brother Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio Infocomm had tried to relieve him by planning to buy the asset of rcom, but the matter did not come to light as the telecom department said that Jio would also have to repay rcom's debt

 ek ore jahaan viipi culture khatm karne ke liye har rajya sarkaar kuch na kuch roj elaan kar raheen hai vahiin hamaare mananeey loksabhaa or rajyasabha saansad iske liye pareshaan najar aa rahe hai
 Our honorable mps want private airlines like Air India to make them travel like 'maharaja'
 bataaya jaataa he ki naagarik uddyan mantralay chahta he ki loksabhaa or rajyasabha ke kareeb 800 saasandon ko nijee airlines shahi suvidhaayen den
 It is clear that the mps want him to get food for free and do something with him, which makes him feel that he is a VIP
 saansadon ko vishesh seva dene kii vyavastha pichley teen saal se lagu he, lekin nagar vimaanan mahanideshaalay (dijisie) ne sabhi airlines ko jari nirdesh main kaha he ki hawaii adde or vimaanan companiyaan shishtachar kii is vyavastha kaa anupaalan nahin kar rahi hai
 However, after getting angry over this instruction, the Ministry of Civil Aviation immediately clarified that no such guidelines have been issued
 mantralay ne kaha ki nijee vimaanan companiyon ko mantriyon or saansadon ko vishesh shishtachar suvidha dene ke bare main koi dishanirdesh jari nahin kiya gaya he
 Some praised, some condemned Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah for criticizing the Center's directive to aviation companies to give privileges to mps, saying that it shows distance from reality
 umr ne twitor par likhaa ki is raajnneetik maahaul main viipi logon ke liye visheshadhikaron kii maang karnaa vaastaviktaa se vishesh kism kii duuri dikhaata he
 Congress MP Sanjay Nirupam said that he does not support any such initiative
 unhone kaha ki mujhe aam aadmi kii tarah yatra karnaa zyada acha lagata he
 Apart from this, our mps get executive class tickets anyway
 yadi unhen isse bhi zyada kuch chahie to mujhe lagata he ki yah aavashyak nahin he
 However, Heavy Industries Minister Praful Patel sees no mistake in this directive
 unhone kaha ki yadi kisi saansad ko thodi si vishesh suvidha di jaati he, thodi izzat di jaati he to mujhe nahin lagata ki is par koi bakheda khadaa hona chahie
 CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury said that he did not see anything special in this order, because mps get special facilities anyway

 (notification dekhne ke liye yahanclikaren) The Citizenship Amendment Bill was tabled for discussion in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday
 bill par charchaa ke dauraan sadan main kaaphi ghamaasan dekhne ko mila
 Derek o'brien of TMC said that you are not taking care of the people of the country and talking about respecting others? Bengal is not Gujarat
 derek o bryan ne kaha ki vaada karne main zyada vaada todane main yah sarkaar shandaar he
 The government says that there is some reason to worry about this bill but i say there is reason to worry
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne notebandi ke samay kaha ki aap mujhe 50 din de dijie agar halaat thik nahin hue to aap mujhe saarvajanik jagah par sajaa de dijiega
 But that did not happen
 derek o bryan ne kaha ki ye log jhooth bolte hai
 Those who say they do not, therefore there is cause for concern on this bill
 isse pehle bijepi ke jepi nadda ne bill ke samarthan main apana paksh rakhaa
 He lashed out at Anand Sharma and said that those lawyers who do not have arguments, keep mentioning other things instead of issues
 gandhi, saavarkar ne kya kaha usase zyada jaruri he is bill par baat kiijie
 JP Nadda also referred to the statement of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in which he had said in the House about the status of the charities who came from there
 bill ke virodh main congress ke varisht netaa anand sharma ne party kaa paksh rakhaa
 He said that this citizenship amendment bill has filled the feeling of insecurity across the country
 logon ke man main ashanka he
 If so, will detention centers be set up across India? It would be unfair
 congress ke varisht netaa ne kaha ki yahaan purnjanm par vishwaas kiya jaataa he
 He said that if Sardar Patel meets Modi ji, he will be very angry
 anand sharma ne tanj kasate hue kaha ki gandhi ji kaa chashma sirf vigyaapan ke liye nahin he
 Anand Sharma expressed his opposition to the bill in the House
 unhone kaha ki yah bill bharat ke samvidhan kii mul bhaavana ke khilaaf he
 Secularism is mentioned in the Preamble of the Constitution, it is also against that basic spirit
 apane bhaashan ke dauraan anand sharma ne mahatma gandhi kaa zikr kiya or kaha ki unka kahana tha ki meraa ghar aisa ho jahaan koi diwaar na ho, jahaan sabhi dharm ke anuyaayi ho
 Earlier, Home Minister Amit Shah, while presenting the Citizens Amendment Bill in Rajya Sabha, said that this bill is not against the Muslims of the country
 unhone kaha ki hamaare teenon padosi desh pakistan, bangladesh, afghanistan islamic desh he
 There are Muslim majority
 isliye jo naagarikta sanshodhan bill pesh kiya gaya he usamen hindu, sikh, jain, bodh, parsi or isai ko bharat kii naagarikta dene kii baat kii gai he
 With the passing of this bill, people of these communities who are living here before December 31, 2014 will get citizenship of India
 jo naarkeey jivan jeene ko majaboor hai unako mukti mil jaaegi
 After Amit Shah introduced the bill, Congress leader Anand Sharma expressed his opposition to the bill in the House
 bijepi netaa jepi nadda ne bill ke paksh main bolaa jabaki tiemasi netaa derek o bryan ne bill ke virodh main party kaa paksh rakhaa
 During a conversation with reporters in London, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said exactly on the question about the growing intolerance in India that this country belongs to Buddha and Gandhi, any small and big incident will not be tolerated here
 magar is uttar kaa thik se vishleshan karne kii zarurat he kyonki isse ashishnutaa ko lekar pradhanmantri ke avchetan main basii kuch dharanaon kaa suraag miltaa he
 It seems as if the Prime Minister acknowledges the onset of intolerance when an 'incident' occurs, for example, somewhere an old man who is sixty years old from a Dadri is killed on suspicion of possessing only beef, or somewhere Dharwad a 78-year-old writer is shot in the house after knocking
 is nigaah se achaanak ‘ashishnutaa’ kaa maamla bada saral ho jaataa he- tab yah vaid aankada diya ja saktaa he ki sava arab kii aabaadi vaale desh main agar ek-do yaa chaar-paanch aisi ghatnaayen ho bhi jaati hai to yah bilkul naganya he or hamaari sahishnutaa kaa suchakank ab bhi bahut upar he, tarah-tarah kii dehshatgardi se ghire mulk to hamaare aasapaas bhi khadey nahin hote
 This measure of tolerance through events instead of mentality was also adopted by the rioters of Atali village before the Prime Minister, when he reminded how non-violent their opposition to minorities has been, that not a single minority was killed in it, with a woman Rape did not happen, just their houses were burnt and they had to flee the village
 isi tarah shivasena ne maharashtra main sudhindra kulkarni kaa munh kaala kar ise bhi apana ahimsak or sahishnu pratirodh bataaya tha, kyonki isamen bhi hinsa nahin hui
 This bjp-like comment of tolerance and non-violence does not actually cut anyone's head, but hangs everyone's sword on the neck
 parampara ke kisi ghise-pite sanskaran ke viruddh, andhvishwaas ke kisi satahi swaroop ke kilaaf agar aapane kuch kaha to kisi kii bhi bhaavana aahat ho sakati he or maut kii dhamkee dene se lekar us par amal tak kiya ja saktaa he
 The victim of this tolerance is also often a history whose extremists, equipped with half-baked understanding, send a damn to your history, for this, they are responsible for the knowledge given by foreigners and imagine that someday they will own history and Indian Will present the commentary
 tippaniyan However, the British journalist had questioned the Indian Prime Minister on increasing intolerance, not asking whether India has a tradition of tolerance
 yah parampara he or itani gahari, vistrut or sarvavidit he ki isko kisi narendra modi kii gavaahi kii zarurat nahin
 The Sangh Parivar also has to bow to this tradition and Narendra Modi is also able to defend himself by handing over Gandhi and Buddha
 sawaal gandhi or buddha kii parampara par nahin, is parampara ko chot pahunchane kii koshish par tha
 The ideology that assassinated Gandhi and who these days is engaged in erecting statues of Godse, is with the current government and the current government is also with him - no doubt
 buddha kaa darshan jis karunaa kii maang karata he, vah is atvaad main sambhav hi nahin
 Ideally, the answer of the British journalist would have been the same that Narendra Modi gave - the tradition of tolerance will continue in India
 lekin isliye nahin ki maujuuda satta use banaae rakhane kii pakshdhar he, balki isliye ki yah parampara itani majboot he, itane gahare dhansi hui he ki use khatm karnaa sambhav nahin he
 People are willing to sacrifice for him
 govind pansre, narendra dabholkar yaa mem kalburgi jaise lekhakon or vichaarkon ne isi parampara ko bachaane ke liye shahadat di
 Writers, scientists, artists and filmmakers who returned their honors performed on their behalf, defending this tolerant and pluralistic tradition
 beshak, jo ashishnutaa kii parampara he vah iskaa imtihaan leti rahati he or in dinon bhi le rahi he
 But tolerance does not leave the pursuit of Modi, it reaches London in the form of a question and forces them to remember that this is the country of Gandhi and Buddha
 magar is uttar kaa thik se vishleshan karne kii zarurat he kyonki isse ashishnutaa ko lekar pradhanmantri ke avchetan main basii kuch dharanaon kaa suraag miltaa he

 But tolerance does not leave the pursuit of Modi, it reaches London in the form of a question and forces them to remember that this is the country of Gandhi and Buddha
 maansikta kii jagah ghatnaon ke zarie sahishnutaa maapne kaa yah paimaana pradhanmantri se pehle ataali gaanv ke dangaiyon ne bhi apanaaya tha, jab unhone yaad dilaayaa ki alpsankhyakon kaa unka virodh kitna ahimsak rahaa he, ki usamen ek bhi alpsankhyak maaraa nahin gaya, kisi mahila ke saath balaatkaar nahin hua, bas unke ghar jalaae gaye or unhen gaanv chhodkar bhaagna padaa
 Similarly, Shiv Sena blackened the face of Sudhindra Kulkarni in Maharashtra and also called it his non-violent and tolerant resistance, because there was no violence in it either
 sahishnutaa or ahimsa kaa yah bhaajapai bhashya darasal sar kisi kaa nahin katata, magar gardan par sabaki talwaar latakaae rakhata he
 Against a worn-out version of tradition, if you say something against a superficial form of superstition, anyone's feelings can be hurt and it can range from being threatened with death to being executed
 is sahishnutaa kaa shikaar aksar itihaas bhi hota he jisaki aadhi-adhuri samaj se las ativaadee aapke itihaas-bodh ko laanat bhejte hai, uske liye videshiyon dwaara die gaye gyaan ko zimmedaar bataate hai or kalpana karte hai ki kisi din ve itihaas kaa apana or bhartiya bhashya pesh karenge
 The comments baharhaal, british patrkaar ne bhartiya pradhanmantri se badhati ashishnutaa par sawaal poocha tha, yah nahin poocha tha ki bharat main sahishnutaa kii parampara he yaa nahin
 It is a tradition and is so deep, detailed and well known that it does not need the testimony of Narendra Modi
 sangh parivaar ko bhi is parampara ke aage sir jhukaana padataa he or narendra modi bhi gandhi or buddha ke hawaale se apana bachaav kar pate hai
 The question was not on the tradition of Gandhi and Buddha, but on the attempt to hurt this tradition
 jis vichaardhaara ne gandhi kii hatya kii or jo in dinon godse kii murtiyon lagavane main lagi hui he, vah maujuuda hukumat ke saath he or maujuuda hukumat bhi uske saath he- isamen kisi ko andeh nahin he
 The compassion that Buddha's philosophy demands is not possible in this extremism
 kaayade se british patrkaar kii baat kaa jawaab vahi hota jo narendra modi ne diya- bharat main sahishnutaa kii parampara bani rahegi
 But not because the existing power is in favor of maintaining it, but because this tradition is so strong, so deeply entrenched that it is not possible to end it
 log uske liye shahadat dene ko taiyaar hai
 Writers and thinkers like Govind Pansare, Narendra Dabholkar or MM Kalburgi martyred to save this tradition
 jin lekhakon, vaigyanikon, kalakaaron or filmkaaron ne apane sammaan lautaae, apni ore se pradarshan kiye, darasal ve isi sahishnu or bahultavaadi parampara kaa bachaav kar rahe the
 Of course, the tradition of intolerance is being tested and is also being taken these days
 lekin sahishnutaa modi kaa peechha chhodti hi nahin, vah ek sawaal kii shakl main landan tak ja pahunchati he or unhen yaad karne ko vivash karti he ki yah gandhi or buddha kaa desh he
 This bjp-like comment of tolerance and non-violence does not actually cut anyone's head, but hangs everyone's sword on the neck
 parampara ke kisi ghise-pite sanskaran ke viruddh, andhvishwaas ke kisi satahi swaroop ke kilaaf agar aapane kuch kaha to kisi kii bhi bhaavana aahat ho sakati he or maut kii dhamkee dene se lekar us par amal tak kiya ja saktaa he
 The victim of this tolerance is also often a history whose extremists, equipped with half-baked understanding, send a damn to your history, for this, they are responsible for the knowledge given by foreigners and imagine that someday they will own history and Indian Will present the commentary

 sawaal gandhi or buddha kii parampara par nahin, is parampara ko chot pahunchane kii koshish par tha
 The ideology that assassinated Gandhi and who these days is engaged in erecting statues of Godse, is with the current government and the current government is also with him - no doubt
 buddha kaa darshan jis karunaa kii maang karata he, vah is atvaad main sambhav hi nahin
 Ideally, the answer of the British journalist would have been the same that Narendra Modi gave - the tradition of tolerance will continue in India
 lekin isliye nahin ki maujuuda satta use banaae rakhane kii pakshdhar he, balki isliye ki yah parampara itani majboot he, itane gahare dhansi hui he ki use khatm karnaa sambhav nahin he
 People are willing to sacrifice for him
 govind pansre, narendra dabholkar yaa mem kalburgi jaise lekhakon or vichaarkon ne isi parampara ko bachaane ke liye shahadat di
 Writers, scientists, artists and filmmakers who returned their honors performed on their behalf, defending this tolerant and pluralistic tradition
 beshak, jo ashishnutaa kii parampara he vah iskaa imtihaan leti rahati he or in dinon bhi le rahi he
 But tolerance does not leave the pursuit of Modi, it reaches London in the form of a question and forces them to remember that this is the country of Gandhi and Buddha
 baharhaal, british patrkaar ne bhartiya pradhanmantri se badhati ashishnutaa par sawaal poocha tha, yah nahin poocha tha ki bharat main sahishnutaa kii parampara he yaa nahin
 It is a tradition and is so deep, detailed and well known that it does not need the testimony of Narendra Modi
 sangh parivaar ko bhi is parampara ke aage sir jhukaana padataa he or narendra modi bhi gandhi or buddha ke hawaale se apana bachaav kar pate hai
 The question was not on the tradition of Gandhi and Buddha, but on the attempt to hurt this tradition
 jis vichaardhaara ne gandhi kii hatya kii or jo in dinon godse kii murtiyon lagavane main lagi hui he, vah maujuuda hukumat ke saath he or maujuuda hukumat bhi uske saath he- isamen kisi ko andeh nahin he
 The compassion that Buddha's philosophy demands is not possible in this extremism
 kaayade se british patrkaar kii baat kaa jawaab vahi hota jo narendra modi ne diya- bharat main sahishnutaa kii parampara bani rahegi
 But not because the existing power is in favor of maintaining it, but because this tradition is so strong, so deeply entrenched that it is not possible to end it
 log uske liye shahadat dene ko taiyaar hai
 Writers and thinkers like Govind Pansare, Narendra Dabholkar or MM Kalburgi martyred to save this tradition
 jin lekhakon, vaigyanikon, kalakaaron or filmkaaron ne apane sammaan lautaae, apni ore se pradarshan kiye, darasal ve isi sahishnu or bahultavaadi parampara kaa bachaav kar rahe the
 Of course, the tradition of intolerance is being tested and is also being taken these days
 lekin sahishnutaa modi kaa peechha chhodti hi nahin, vah ek sawaal kii shakl main landan tak ja pahunchati he or unhen yaad karne ko vivash karti he ki yah gandhi or buddha kaa desh he
 Ideally, the answer of the British journalist would have been the same that Narendra Modi gave - the tradition of tolerance will continue in India
 lekin isliye nahin ki maujuuda satta use banaae rakhane kii pakshdhar he, balki isliye ki yah parampara itani majboot he, itane gahare dhansi hui he ki use khatm karnaa sambhav nahin he
 People are willing to sacrifice for him

 beshak, jo ashishnutaa kii parampara he vah iskaa imtihaan leti rahati he or in dinon bhi le rahi he

 haal main sampann vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh kii navnirvaachit sarkaron dwaara kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii ghoshnaa shapath grahan ke chand ghante baad hi kar di gai
 After which the Assam government announced a debt waiver and the Gujarat government announced a waiver of the farmers' electricity bill
 lihaaja yah sawaal uthanaa laazmi he ki ab tak jin sarkaron ne kisaanon kii karjamaafee kii uski jamini hakeekat kya he?gauratlab he ki punjab main vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan congress ne karjamaafee kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 The Punjab government also started loan waiver in a phased manner
 bataa den ki punjab main kul 10
 5 lakh farmer families and 20 lakh people are associated with farming
 rajya ke kisaanon par 8 xxrep 4 0 karod rupee kaa karj he
 In its election manifesto, the Congress had promised the entire debt waiver of the farmers of Punjab, but soon after forming the government, it reversed its promise and started a plan to waive loans up to Rs 2 lakh only
 punjab sarkaar apane kaarykaal ke 21 maheenon ke dauraan ab tak 4
 The loan of Rs 3586 crore of 27 lakh farmers has been waived
 jabaki yojana ke liye chaynit baaki bache 2,69752 se adhik kisaanon ke karj yojana ke tisare or chauthe charan main maaf kiye jaaenge
 The Punjab government's debt is full of flaws, the debt waiver scheme of the Punjab government is not embracing the opposition
 pramukh vipakshi dal shiromani akali dal ke netaaon ke mutabik jin kisaanon ko rin maafee yojana ke liye chunaa gaya unki sankhya kaaphi kam he
 Because the loan amount of most farmers is more than two lakh rupees
 vipaksh ke mutabik punjab sarkaar kii rin maafee yojana kai khaamiyon se bhari padi he
 The government is only waiving loans taken from cooperative and nationalized banks
 jabaki zyaadaatar kisaanon ne nijee sahukaaron se karj liya he
 The government does not currently have any plans to forgive
 akali dal ke pravaktaa or mahasachiv dow dalajit cheema ke mutabik rajya kii congress sarkaar ne rin maafee ke naam par kisaanon ke saath dhokhaa kiya he
 There is a debt of up to two lakh rupees, and Congress leaders believe that due to poor financial condition, the government chose that class of farmers, most of whom were committing suicide
 rajya sarkaar ab tak do charnon main 4
 It has waived debts of 27 lakh farmers
 rajya sarkaar ne karjamaafee ke liye maujuuda bajet main 14734 karod rupee kaa praavdhaan kiya tha, jisamen se 3586 karod rupye kharch ja chuke hai
 According to Congress spokesperson Jagpal Singh Abulkhurana, the government will initially waive loans up to Rs 2 lakh and then consider waiving the loans of farmers with more loans than that
 fasali rin maafee kisaanon ke hit main nahinudhar krishi or aarthik maamalon ke jaankaar, institute for deveopment and communication ke nideshak professor pramod kumaar karjamaafee ko sahi nahin maanate
 They believe that there is a need to introduce pension and social security schemes for the farmers to save them from the clutches of the moneylenders
 taaki vah jarurat padane par sahookaaron yaa bank se karj na len
 According to Professor Pramod Kumar, it will not be good for farmers to forgive their debts
 kyonki kisaanon kii aay lagaataar gir rahi he or jab tak unki aay doguni nahin hoti, tab tak vah karz lene ko majaboor hote rahenge
 The central government's ambitious Atal Ayushman scheme is engaged in setting up private hospitals and doctors
 abhi tak 12 aise nijee aspataalon ko soochibaddh kiya gaya he, jinhone karodon kaa farjivada kiya he
 Of this, the government has paid 52 lakhs and only about 52 lakhs are left
 in aspataalon main se do aspataalon ko list se baahar kar diya gaya he jabaki 10 aspataal abhi jaanch ke daayre main hai
 Modi government launched Atal Ayushman Yojana to provide free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh to the poor
 lekin kuch aspataal logon ke haq par daaka daalane ke saath hi sarkaar ko bhi chuunaa lagane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Acting as Additional Director of Atal Ayushman Yojana, two hospitals have been removed from the list after taking action, while notices have been issued to 10 other hospitals due to forgery
 aspataalon kaa jawaab aane ke baad hi aage kii karrwai kii jaaegi
 The Central Government started the Atal Ayushman Yojana so that no class or section is denied treatment
 lekin nijee aspataalon ke farjivade se logon kaa haq to chhin hi rahaa he, saath hi sarkari paise kaa durupyog bhi ho rahaa he
 So far, no penalty and penalty has been collected from the fraudulent hospitals, while payment of 52 lakh has also been made to the hospitals and 52 lakh is still due
 atal ayushmaan ke apper nideshak ke mutabik abhi 10 aspataalon par antim nirnay nahin liya gaya he
 Answers have been sought from hospitals, after which further action will be taken

 Due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Indonesia, all the news related to Indonesia came, but one such news also went viral on social media, after seeing which people were shocked that is it really? In these reports, it has been claimed that despite being a completely Muslim majority country, the currency note of Indonesia has a photo of Lord Ganesha printed on it
 soshal media par jo khabaren share ho rahi hai usamen indonesia kaa ek note bhi dikhaaya ja rahaa he jo 20,000 kaa he or jis par vaaki ganesh kii photo chhapi hui dikhti he
 The note also shows a photo of an elderly man with Ganesha
 agar aap indonesia ke note google par khojna shuru karenge to aapako 20,000 ke jo note dikhenge wo isse bilkul alag hai or us par kahin ganesh ji kahin nahin dikhte
 But when we looked at the website of Ganesh ji to search further, we found this note
 website par di gai jaankaree se pataa chalaa ki is note ko indonesia kii sarkaar ne 1998 main jari kiya tha
 The name of the person printed on the 20,000 note bearing Ganesh ji is 'ki Thousand Deventra', who was a freedom fighter from Indonesia and who did a lot of work in the field of education
 1945 main wo indonesia ke shiksha mantri bhi rahe the
 The note shows class rooms at the back as the note was printed on the theme of education itself
 lekin ganesh ji kii photo vaala 20,000 kaa indonesia kaa note 10 saal tak prachlan main rahane ke baad 2008 ke ant main band ho gaya
 Indonesia is a completely Muslim country with a Hindu population of less than 2%
 aise main sawaal yah uthta he ki aakhir note par ganesh ji kii photo indonesia kii sarkaar ne kyon chhaapi thi?bahut kam logon ko yah baat maaloom he ki muslim bahulya desh hone ke baavjood sankhya ke hisaab se indonesia main hinduon kii taadaad bahut badi he
 You will be surprised to know that after India, Nepal and Bangladesh, Indonesia is the country where most Hindus live
 indonesia ke bali main to 80 fisadi se zyada aabaadi balanij hinduon kii he or vahaan par hajaaron chote bade mandir hai
 Despite having only two per cent Hindu population, Hindu deities have been revered in Indonesia's culture
 bhagwaan vishnu ke vaahan kahe jane vaale garud ke naam par indonesia main ek airlines chalati he
 In Indonesia, stamps have been issued in the names of Pandavas along with Ganesh, Krishna and Hanuman
 indonesia kii rajdhani jakarta main arjuna vivaah ke naam se ek vishaal pratimaa bhi lagi hui he jo mahabharat ke drishy ko dikhaati he
 The National Emblem of Indonesia is also called Garuda Punkshil
 indonesia ke ek pratishthit ejineering college bandung institute of technology ke logo par bhi bhagwaan ganesh kii tasviir bani hui he
 Not only this, a huge statue of Saraswati, the goddess of learning, has been installed outside the Embassy of Indonesia in America
 jahaan tak 20,000 ke note par ganesh ji kii photo lagane kaa sawaal he to is bare main logon kii raay alag-alag he
 It is also believed that Ganesha is the god of wisdom and he wrote the Mahabharata with his teeth at the behest of Vyas ji
 isiilie unhen ekadant bhi kaha jaataa he
 The theme of the 20,000 notes of Indonesia on which the photo of Lord Ganesha is made is education and it is possible that it has been decided to print the photo of Ganesha
 lekin indonesia ke note par ganesh bhagwaan kii photo chhapane sambandhit ek or rochak tathy bhi he
 During the economic recession of Asia in 1997, the price of currency had fallen drastically in many countries including Indonesia
 is dauraan indonesia kii karency bhi dollar ke mukaable itani neeche gir gai ki desh main bhayankar aarthik sankat ho gaya tha
 It can be called a coincidence, but it is true that after the photo of Ganesh ji was printed on the 20,000 note in 1998, the next year in 1999, Indonesia's economic condition and currency situation improved rapidly
 viral test main indonesia ke note par ganesh kii photo chhapi hone ke baad sahi nikali haalanki yah note ab prachlan main nahin he

 On this occasion, Rajkumar Hirani said that the experience of making the biopic is completely different from other films, especially at the script level
 unhone mana ki sanju ko banane main unhen kaaphi mushkilen huin

 Many of Sanjay Dutt's rajas in the film said - We are unable to write a story based on imagination and the best thing is that Sanjay helped us get access to his story and stories
 hiraani ne kaha, darshak sanjay se jude kuch raaj film main jaanane kii ummid kar sakate hai, jinke bare main unke drug lene ke dinon main or jail main hone ke dauraan khub baaten kii gai

 The Supreme Court has dismissed the petition of the Rajasthan government granting relief to all four people, including Salman Khan, in the case of hunting black deer
 supreme court ne haalanki guuruuvaar ke aadesh main kaha ki un par vanya jeev sangrakshan adhinium ke tahat kanoonee karrwai kii jaaegi
 The petition advocated conviction of Salman and others under Section 146 of the IPC

 The bench headed by Sadashivam did not accept the Rajasthan government's petition
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki salmaan tathaa chaar anya par bhartiya dand samhita ke praavdhaanon ke tahat danga bhadakaane kaa bhi maamla chalaaya jaae
 The case of hunting black deer dates back to 1998, when the shooting of the film 'hum Saath Saath Hain' was going on

 yadi yah maamla suraksha parishad ke samaksh aata he, to america bhi vito kaa istemaal na karne ko variyata degaa
 But in case there is no option left, it seems that he will be ready to use the veto on this step

 However, the government says that every section will be taken care of

 vahiin bijepi kah rahi he ki yah durbhaavna he, galat he
 Former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said that 'it is my strong wish to run that department, it is not right to change the name for the name
 ab anand kaa naam badal diya
 If it is good, do not let it go, but what is the problem, but this is the problem at this time, i will change everything
 ab sab badal daaloongaa to vandemataram bhi ho gaya, anand bhi ho gaya
 Now, who is saying this, i do not understand

 ' chunaav se pehle rahul gandhi se lekar kamalnath tak kii mandir daud par bijepi ne kai sawaal uthaae the

 'desh kaa karj chukaane' kii baat kahkar pradhanmantri pad ke liye apni ummidavaari kaa spasht sanket die jane se sambandhit gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke bayaan par raajnneeti main nayaa bavaal much gaya he
 On Thursday, Modi made it clear in gestures through the statement that he was ready to claim the post of Prime Minister

 Significantly, in Gandhinagar on Thursday, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi said that it is the duty of every child to repay the debt of Mother India
 modi ne kaha, na sirf modi balki har bachche or naagarik kaa bharat mata ke prati rin he
 
 
 It is his duty to repay it whenever the opportunity comes
 modi ne raajnneetik arthon vaali yah tippanee ek pustak vimochan samaaroh ke dauraan lekhak arapy gupta ke bayaan par pratikriya main di

 tippaniyan Modi said, a doctor pays his debt to Mother India by saving someone's life
 
 
 ek shikshak bacchon ko padhaakar aisa karata he
 Giving a clear indication of being ready to play a big role in national politics, Modi said, "everyone has to repay this debt
" 
 
 mujhe ummid he ki bharat mata aashirwad detii he or koi vyakti karj chukaaye bina nahin jaataa
 Modi has recently been inducted into the BJP Parliamentary Board, the apex decision-making body in the party
 kai vishleshkon kaa maananaa he ki modi ko sansadeey board main shaamil kiya janaa, unhen pradhanmantri pad ke liye aupchaarik ummidavaar manonith kiye jane kaa pehla kadam he

 magar bahut kam logon ko ye pataa hoga ki akshay kumaar ke paas bharat kii naagarikta nahin he
 They cannot vote in India
 akshay ke paas kenadian passport he
 Apart from this, it would be very surprising to know that Bollywood's cute girl Alia Bhatt also does not vote in India
 bataa den ki unke paas british passport he
 Therefore, she cannot vote in India
 View this post on instagramnever has there been any doubt in my mind about who i am or where I’m from

 katrina caff ke paas euke kaa passport he
 Jacqueline Fernandes holds a passport from Sri Lanka and Sunny Leoni holds a Canadian passport
 deepika padukon ko lekar bhi tarah tarah kii baaten ho rahi thim ki ve bharat main vot nahin de saktin

 Question: In your opinion, Narendra Modi has molded himself in the mold of which Indian Prime Minister? Answer: Not in the mold of his party's predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 abhi yah tay hona baaki he ki apana ek-tihaai kaarykaal puraa kar chuke modi pehle ke kis pradhanmantri se mail khate hai
 During the preparations for the Union Government's budget and after it was tabled in Parliament on February 29, strange parallels are seen between her and Indira Gandhi
 samanthaayen sirf unke kaam karne ke tareeke (donon ko nirankush mana jaataa he) or unke karishme (donon ne apni nijee lokapriyata ke dam par apni partiyon ko mashhoor jeet dilaai) main hi nahin he, balki is baat main bhi hai ki mushkilon se ghire hone par kis tarah apane dushman or apni praathamiktaayen tay karne kaa andaaj bhi donon kaa kaaphi kuch ek jaisaa he
 Indira Gandhi was furious about the "foreign hands" that used to constantly plot to move her throne, so a week before the budget, Modi also slammed those ngos with foreign funds whose "motive for Modi" Have to finish
 ”congress ke 1969 main dophaad hone ke baad jab indira gandhi ke netritv ko chunauti di gai, to unhone “garibi hataao” kaa elaan kar diya, jo aazaadee ke baad kaa sabase bada garibi unmoolan kaarykram tha
 This helped him to make direct inroads into the poor of the villages and cities and he won the 1971 general election with huge public support
 unke 20 sutri kaarykram main vishaal gramin rojgaar guarantee yojana, sabhi gaanvon ko pine kaa pani or gaanvon main bijli pahunchaana shaamil tha
 After the defeat of his party in the recent state assembly elections, the constantly insecure and slowing economy, poor economic condition of the villages, sharp decline in exports, sharp criticism of his government for being pro-rich and growing civilian turmoil in the country Surrounded Modi has in some ways outpaced Indira Gandhi
 2016 ke bajet main unhone kheti-kisaani or garibi hataane ke kaaryakramon par donon haathon se ab tak kaa sabase zyada dhan nyochaavar kiya he
 With this, he hopes that the Indian economy will go on the path of faster growth and will give him a second term
 aisa karte hue modi ne us suut-boot kii sarkaar ke tamge se bhi pallaa chhudaane kii koshish kii he jo rahul gandhi ne unke upar chaspaan kar diya tha
 Instead, he has asserted himself to be wearing the image of dhoti kurta, presenting himself as the new messiah of the poor and downtrodden
 pradhanmantri ne khud ko phir se “vikaas vaala” ke taur par bhi sthapit kiya he, magar unhen sangh parivaar ko apane baantne vaale agenda par lagaam kasne ke liye taiyaar karnaa he, jo haal ke dinon main is agenda ko or bhi josho-kharosh se lagu kar rahaa he
 One difference between Indira Gandhi, who runs both the government and the Congress party as per her choice, is that Modi has to deal with the growing interference of the Sangh in government decisions
 sach kahen to indira gandhi kii style se fark or bhi hai, jo modi ke liye mufeed hai
 While nationalizing important sectors including banks, she went far further on the path of socialism, while Modi is moving steadily on the middle path
 isiilie pradhanmantri ne garibi mitaao main badi rakam jhonkate hue bhi buniyadi dhaancha khadaa karne main, khaskar sadakon or makaanon main, baari-bharkam dhanrashi lagaana pakkaa kiya he
 By approving 100 per cent FDI in the food processing sector, encouraging private gas production and freeing the road traffic sector from bottlenecks and restrictions, they have also indicated that they will be on track to liberalize the economy
 jahaan tak karon kii baat he, to korporate kshetra ko unhone koi raahat to nahin di he, magar bajet ne kar nirdhaaran or vivaad nibatare kii prakriyaaon ko saral banaakar or pichhali taarikh se kar lagane ke bare main saare sandehon ko dur karke “tex terarysm” ko khatm kiya he
 The important thing is that the Modi government has openly pumped funds in many programs and sectors, yet it has maintained fiscal discipline while meeting deficit targets
 vitt mantralay ke afasar kehete hai, “isi faisle kii badaulat bajet kii ghoshnaaon ko loklubhaavan kii bajaae lokapriy qaraar diya gaya
 This decision of fiscal prudence was taken after heated debate within the government
 pradhanmantri ke kuch ahm salaahkaaron ne unase kaha tha ki rajkoshiya paabandiyon ko ateet kii anchaahi viraasat maanakar taak par rakhen or kisi baat kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr kaaryakramon par donon haathon se kharch karen
 Others warn him
 ek afasar ne is baat ko is dhang se kaha, “yah aisa hi hota ki bharat puri taiyaari ke bagaiyr raturaat yah faisla kar letaa ki ab sabhi kaaron main stearing wheel bain taraf hona chahie
 Modi bowed to the right of understanding and he struck a fine balance
 is faisle se duniya bhar ke niveshkon ko bharosa bandhaa or bajet pesh karne ke baad share bazaar main phir oochaal dikhaa
 Says a senior Foreign Ministry official, "I was heartbroken in the beginning when i saw so much emphasis on poverty reduction programs, when i read about infrastructure investment, tax measures and fiscal restraint, i immediately understood Gone is that foreign investors must have breathed peace
 ve bharat sang ekajute ho jaaenge
 They may have expected more, but they cannot complain
 ”yah to jaahir hi tha ki puure bajet par khud pradhanmantri kii chhap thi
 He held 10 meetings with various departments and personally examined each and every scheme of the thrust area
 chaahe vah krishi kshetra ho yaa gramin kshetra yaa phir shiksha, swasthya, urja, parivahan yaa kar kshetra ho
 a senior officer present there said that Modi realized that the global environment had created a turbulent turmoil, the world economy was shaking and the Indian economy would have to be fortified by future fluctuations
 unhen yah ehsaas bhi tha ki tel ke kam daamon ne unki sarkaar kaa khajaana bharne main madad kii he, magar ye halaat hameshaa kaayam nahin rah sakate hai
 Modi told the officers, "let us not wait for the global crisis to have an impact on us, instead we go ahead and take such measures that will have the least impact
" ”pradhanmantri ne lagaataar do fasalon ke kharaab hone kii vajah se desh ke ahm rajyon main gaanvon kii tangahaali par bhi chintaa jataai or raahat dene kii jarurat par jor diya
 During the discussions on the budget, he made it clear that agriculture and rural development should be given attention and besides that there should be huge public investment in infrastructure to spur economic growth
 unhen pataa tha ki vinirmaan kshetra ladkadaa rahaa he, niryaat gir rahe hai or gharelu nijee nivesh bhi ghist rahaa he
 So they decided to place bets on large-scale government funding for faster and higher economic growth
 ek varisht afasar kehete hai, “arthvyavastha ko jaruri protsaahan dene ke liye pradhanmantri rajkoshiya sanyam kaayam rakhte hue maang or khapat se aage badhati vruddhi par bharosa karke chal rahe hai
 But he was also clear that money should be invested in wealth creation, such as roads, whose impact would continue to increase
 ” unki sarkaar kii ummiden is baat par bhi tiki hai ki aisa mushkil se hi kabhi hua he ki fasalein lagaataar teen saal kharaab rahi hon
 So Modi's team hopes that the monsoon will be good this year
 isse arthvyavastha main or bhi tej vruddhi kii sambhaavna bad jaaegi
 After the budget, there is a lot of debate that the Prime Minister who came to power has gone out of his way by promising reforms and making claims like "the government should not do business"
 unke aalochak unke upar dhire-dhire aage badhane kii niti apnaane kaa iljaam lagaate hai, jo vinievesh ko dhimaa karke or vruddhi ko tej raftaar dene ke liye baari-bharkam saarvajanik nivesh par bharosa karke chal rahe hai
 Modi is obviously not in favor of the traditional ideological imposition of being left or south
 apane sahyogiyon se ve kehete hai, “main paisa banaaungaa or use baant duungaa
 "modi made his economic policy clear last year, when he said in a program," There is no conflict between doing big things and doing small things
 inamen se ek tarika nai nitiyon, kaaryakramon, badi pariyojnaon or rasta badalane vaale badlaavon kaa he
 In the second one has to focus on small things of importance, create a mass movement and create mass movement, which then leads to development
 hamen donon raaston par chalane kii jarurat he
 In the 2016 budget, he has struck a better balance between these two paths
 or unhone pichhali sarkaar kii nitiyon ko gale lagane or unamem sudhaar karne se bhi sankoch nahin kiya, vaise hi jaise unhone aadhaar or manaregaa ke saath kiya he
 He told a colleague, "my economic vision is growth and development and i will not rest until we achieve double-digit growth in GDP in the coming years
" ”kendriya bajet sansad main rakhe jane ke kuch hi ghanton baad modi ne apane varisht afasaron ko piemo main bulaayaa or unase kaha, “bajet to ho gaya, ab is par amal shuru karen
 "the Prime Minister is well aware that much of the budget's success will depend on the rapid implementation of the plans, which he has announced
 bharat kii lalaphitaashahee ke bare main unki yah baat kaaphi mashhoor he, “jindagi main moksh hasil karne ke liye log chaar dham yatra par jate hai
 a file in the government has to travel to thirty-six dham and still do not get salvation
 ”ab jab driving seat par ve khud virajman hai, unhen bharat ko aarthik moksh dilaane ke liye koi kasar baaki nahin rahane deni chahie

 The crooks in the country's capital, Delhi, have become so fearless that even after committing the murder incident, they do not back down
 ab badmaashon ne dilli main ek meet vyapaaree ko goli maar di
 Due to which the meat trader died

 vaishvik str par crude oil kii badhati keemton se desh main petrol 80 rupee prati litre or dijal 67 rupee prati litre ke kareeb pahunch gaya
 At the same time, crude oil crossed $ 70 a barrel on Tuesday in the global market
 crude oil kaa yah str 2014 main ai naatakeey giravat ke pehle kaa he yani crude kii keemten lagbhag teen saal puraane ucchtam str ke paar chali gai he
 In such a situation, speculation has started once again whether the price of petrol in the country will cross Rs 100 per liter before the global crude oil crosses $ 100 per barrel? The journey from 2017 to 2017 has proved to be a game changer for the country's politics
 pichhali congress sarkaar kii chunautiyon ko global crude oil kii keemton ne itnaa badha diya ki 2014 main mahangaai ke mudde par sarkaar ko chunaav main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 At the same time, soon after the election results in 2014, global crude oil prices proved to be a boon for the new BJP government formed at the center
 is dauraan hue utaar-chadhaav ke bich jahaan global market main crude oil kii keemat 125 dollar prati bairal se lekar 30 dollar prati bairal tak ludhaki, vahiin desh main petrol kii keemat 76 rupee se 56 rupee prati litre tak gai
 Now once again, the prices of crude have started improving in the global market
 modi sarkaar ko mila tha saste petrol kaa vardaanjanvari 2012 main manmohan singh sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan antarrashtriya bazaar main crude oil 125 dollar prati bairal tak pahunch gai or 2014 main hue aam chunaavon tak yah keemat lagaataar 100 dollar prati bairal par bani rahi
 Elections were held in April 2014 and crude prices started slipping
 chunaav ke nattejey aate hi may 2014 main shuru hui yah phislan disambar 2015 tak crude kii keemat ko 100 dollar prati bairal se giraakar 50 dollar prati bairal par le ai
 This slippery does not end here
 janvari 2016 tak crude oil kii keemten girakar apane abtak ke nunatam str 30 dollar prati bairal par pahunch gai
 It is worth noting that the price of crude oil is the biggest and most important expenditure from the central government treasury
 yahaan bachaa hua ek-ek paisa sarkaar ko apni aarthik-saamaajik nitiyon ko aage badhaane ke kaam aata he
 Read this: Economic Survey: How much has the situation changed from the first threat to demonetisation, crude oil prices to GDP? The rules for determining the price of petrol in the country have changed
 jahaan pehle prati maheene emport cost ke aankalan ke saath tex jodakar prati do maah par petrol kii keemat nirdhaarit kii jaati thi
 After this, the price of petrol on this formula was fixed every month and then every week
 lekin beete kuch maheenon se global market main crude oil ke prati din utaar-chadhaav or desh main tex ke aankalan se prati din petrol kii keemat nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 So during these three years, due to heavy changes in crude prices, the price of petrol is also fluctuating
 2014 main crude kii phislan kaa aam aadmi ko pehla phayda 2015 main milanaa shuru hua
 While crude reached the level of $ 30 per barrel, the price of petrol per liter in Delhi went down to Rs 60 per liter for the first time
 haalanki puure saal ke dauraan petrol kii keemat 66 rupee se 60 rupee prati litre tak rahi
 By October 2016, the game of cheap petrol was over and the prices of petrol started increasing once again
 is dauraan ek litre petrol kii keemat waapas 66 rupee se badhkar 70 rupee ke str par pahunch gai or saal 2017 ke dauraan ek baar phir petrol kii keemat 70 rupee prati litre se 63 rupee prati litre par pahunch gai
 Now in the beginning of 2018, crude oil prices are going to increase once again and globally experts believe that in the coming days, rising economies will start to suffer losses
 jab 150 dollar pahunch gai thi crude kii keemtvaishvik sanstha orgenigeshan for iconomic kooparation and deveopment (oisidi) kii bhavishyavaanee he ki maujuuda vaishvik aarthik sthiti main 2020 tak crude oil kii keemat 270 dollar prati bairal tak ja sakati he
 Significantly, in 2008, crude oil was at an all-time high of $ 145 per barrel
 vahiin 2015 or 2016 ke dauraan khadi deshon main jari vivaad or china samet vikasshil deshon main maang kii kami ke chalate crude oil kii keemat 30 dollar prati bairal ke str par pahunch gai
 The basis of the oecd's prediction is that economies like China and India could increase the demand for fuel significantly in the coming years
 ise padhein: jaane bajet 2018 kii spich kaa share bazaar par padegaa kya asar!bina 100 dollar crude ke bhi 100 rupee litre hoga petrol?bharat main petrol kii keemat 100 rupee kaa paar jane ke liye jaruri nahin ki crude oil is str ko chhue
 For the last three years, the price of crude in the country and the tax being charged by the Central and State Governments can bring the price of petrol to 100 rupees at the same time once the crude oil touches the 2014 level i
e
 $ 100 per barrel
 gauratlab he ki desh main july 2017 main jiesti lagu kiya gaya lekin petrol-dijal kii keemton ko jiesti daayre se baahar rakhi gai
 This was done because the taxes levied by the states on petrol and diesel form a major part of their annual revenue
 jiesti ke tahat ise laae jane ke baad puure desh main petrol-dijal par kendriya tex lagaakar ek keemat par bechnaa shuru ho jayega
 Artists: Amir Khan, Anushka Sharma, Saurabh Shukla and Baman Irani Director: Rajkumar Hiranirating: 4
 5 staramir khan or rajkumaar hiraani kii jodi jo na kare vah kam he
 The same can be said about 'PK'
 aise daur main jab dharm jaise mudde samaaj main kaaphi teji se tair rahe hai
 At a time when the contractors of religion are going behind bars
 aise samaaj main jo dharm ko lekar bahut hi zyada samvedansheeltaa se guzar rahaa he, usamen is tarah kii filmein aana vaaki diarector, produsar or actor kii oonchi soch kii ore ishaara karti he
 This is a film that describes today's times well
 dharm ke thekedaaron kii dhajjiyaan udaati he
 Which tells that it is fear in whose name the business of religion is spreading and it is being spread well
 pike bataata he ki aaj samaaj main do bhagwaan ho chuke hai, ek to vah jo insaan banaata he or ek vah jo insaan ko banaata he
 And he teaches that worship should be done to the God who created man
 rajkumaar hiraani ne is baat ko bakhubi siddh kar diya he ki sabar kaa fal meetha hota he
 Solid message can also be given along with entertainment
 kahani main kitna damek alian (aamir khan) dharti par aa jaataa he
 Listening to his questions on earth, people start calling him PK
 vah dharti ko gola kahata he auki har baat ko tark kii kasuti par kasata he
 He meets a TV journalist (anushka Sharma)
 vah uski kahani sunati he
 At first she does not believe and when she believes, then many truths emerge
 film main ek dharm guruon kaa sataaya tivi channel maalik (baman irani) he to ek paakhandee guru (saurabh shukla) bhi he
 Simply, the entire film runs with a solid story
 jisamen tarkon auki hakeekat ke jariye dharmandhta or andhanukaran ko dur karne kii koshish kii jaati he
 Nowhere does it appear that an attempt is being made to give a speech or message
 film main kahani he
 There are hundreds of opportunities to laughter from start to finish
 kahani kahin bhi dimag ko film se dur hone kaa mauka nahin detii he
 Editing is also tight
 paakhandee baabaaon kii dhajjiyaan udaane vaali film oh maay god aa chuki he
 PK carries the same message, but in the style of Rajkumar Hirani
 iskaa samay or treetment donon film ko ekadam alag bana dete hai
 However there is no comparison between the two films
 star apilamir khan ne siddh kar diya he ki ve jab bhi rajkumaar hiraani ke saath aaenge to aisa cinema lekar aaenge jise dekhakar har varg or umr kaa audiyans usase judega
 'PK' is one such film and character
 vah bahut hi sahajata ke saath aate hai
 Bhojpuri speaks and tries to know this colorful world
 ve role main is kadar utar jate hai ki har seen main majaa aata he
 He lives throughout the film and is excellent in acting
 anoushka sharma ne bhi unka acha saath diya he
 Sushant Singh Rajput is also fine in small roles
 saurabh shukla paakhandee baba ke kirdaar main mast hai or baman irani bhi thik hai
 There is already a lot of hype in the market regarding PK
 har darshak varg main ise lekar jabardast craij bhi he
 There is tremendous pre booking
 single screen theatre main pehla din or pehla sho dekhne par is baat kaa ishaara mil jaataa he ki aamir front ro se lekar balakani tak ke darshakon ko siti bajaane or taaliyaan bajaane ke liye majaboor kar sakate hai
 The film was made on a big budget and a long time
 isane pehle hi kaaphi jabardast majbootee darj kara lee he
 There is a great connect for every age group from youth
 maujuuda sachaai he
 It is an attempt to show reality
 lekin sab kuch rajkumaar hiraani style main
 Then the storyline of the film has been hidden, due to which the word of mouth publicity will work a lot as people will see this film
 phir jaisaa ek baahar nikal rahaa darshak kah rahaa tha,“bhai, ab to teen baje kaa sho bhi dekhne aana padegaa

 The risk of aids breaking the needle in treatment According to dentists, the fine needle used when treating teeth breaks many times
 iske chalate jo maamuli si dikhti chot najar aati he, kai baar vahi sankraman kaa kaaran ban jaati he
 This is why dentists are nervous about treating HIV AIDS patients

 After Sridevi's death, the most discussed thing was that she could not see her daughter on the big screen
 lekin Vogue megsine ke ek intervyuu main karan johar ne is baat kaa khulaasa kiya ki jahnavi kapur kii film dhadak kaa 25 minute kaa footage shridevi ne dekha tha
 After watching the footage, he also gave special taps to Jahnavi
 film debyue se pehle jahnavi kaa pehla magazine photoshute, dikhaa mordan lukajahnavi kapur ne karan johar ke saath hue intervyuu main bataaya ki maa ne mujhe pehali baar dekhakar yahi kaha tha ki footage main tumhaara muskara kaaphi fail gaya he, jo tumhe bhi disturb kar rahaa he
 The second thing he said was that you could never do anything on your face
 jahnavi ne bataaya ki maine landan ke acting skool main padhai kii he
 Leaving me there for the first time, the mother said here that i am leaving Kamal in the mud
 isaki vajah thi ki maa nahin chaahati thi ki main filmi duniya main kadam rakhun
 She was relieved to appear in Khushi's films

 While changing the government, there will be frustration for the defeat of any party supporters, there is also a fear in them
 kai baar haarane vaali party ke kaaryakarta dar ke kaarnon ko samaj nahin pate hai
 The reason for this is simple
 jab kisi samarthak kii party satta main aati he to thanon main bhi aati he
 Also comes for false lawsuits and land possession
 bhartee main sifarish or tabadale ke liye bhi aati he
 Also comes in the government for the sharing of contracts
 sarkari vibhaagon main kareed farost ke liye bhi aati he
 In all these processes, supporters of the government have fun
 ve raaton raat amir hone lagate hai
 As soon as the government goes, this section starts feeling insecure
 nai sarkaar ke samarthak or party kaaryakarta khush ho jate hai
 Now the supporters and activists of the old government would have demanded a transparent system that works for everyone, would have opposed discrimination, so why fear the government's departure
 sarkaar hameshaa meri hoti he, hamaari nahin hoti
 When governments start becoming ours, then there will be no fear of defeat
 hamaari sarkaar ke liye zaruri he ki sab sawaalon se, aalochanaon se sarkaar par nazar rakhen or dekhte rahen ki sarkaar kaa laabh koi na uthaa sake
 If you are a party worker, then ask yourself one question, do you question your government
 agar haarane vaali party kaa kaaryakarta ye mul baat samaj legaa to wo dar se azaad hokar agle chunaav kii taiyaari main lag jayega
 In India, charges range from ballot boxes to electronic machines
 agar iviem mashin kii raajnneeti ko samajhnaa he to iske best udhaaharan hai captain amarinder singh
 In September last year, Captain Amarinder Singh made a statement that after losing the election in 2012, he wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner that the evms should be investigated in detail
 ise kaise phulpruf banaaya ja saktaa he kyonki kuch deshon ne dobaaraa ballat paper kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya he
 The Congress has consistently said in Punjab that evms are not foolproof
 2016 ke sitambar maheene main captain amarinder singh ne phir se iviem par sawaal uthaaya or kaha ki sarkari adhikari iviem se chhedchhad kar sakate hai
 Therefore EVM machines should be brought from other states
 2017 main chunaav jeetne ke baad captain amarinder singh ne jo kaha wo mazedaar he
 He said that the Aam Aadmi Party was blaming the EVM for disturbing it by losing
 amarinder ke teenon bayanon se lagata he ki ve haarane ke baad, haar ke dar se to iviem par sawaal uthaa rahe the magar jeetne ke baad unhen iviem par bharosa ho gaya
 The example is given by Captain Saheb, but many big leaders have raised the question
 you tub par aapako bijepi saansad subramanyam swami ke iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad ke video mil jaaenge jinamein ve vistaar se bataa rahe hai ki kis tarah iviem kaa mukhya ang japan se ban kar aata he, magar vahi japan iviem kaa istemaal nahin karata
 Subrahmanyam Swamy is the main face for the possibility of tampering with EVM machines and has taken the fight to court
 jayalalita ab duniya main nahin hai lekin 2001 main ve madras hoicourt chali gayi
 It was alleged that in the EVM, the voter presses the button but until the presiding officer presses the button, his vote is not registered
 agar kisi bhi vajah se peethasin adhikari se batan nahin dabaa to voter kaa vot gina nahin jayega
 Jayalalithaa had said that Defense Ministers George Fernandes and m Karunanidhi had also questioned evms but kept quiet after winning
 2010 main telegu desham party ke netaa chandrababu naidu ne kaha tha ki iviem ko temper kiya ja saktaa he
 According to a Times of India news in August 2010, BJP and Left leaders raised the issue of evms in the Rajya Sabha
 arun jetali ne maang kii thi ki sarkaar is par sarvadaleey baithak bulaaye, kuch takneekee visheshgyon ko bhi bulaaye taaki jo andeh hai unhen dur kiya ja sake
 Lal Krishna Advani had said that according to the experience of the whole world, there is no such thing that can be called Temper Proof EVM
 matlab aisi koi mashin nahin he jiske bare main daawa kiya ja saktaa he ki chhedchhad nahin ho sakati he
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao has also written a book about the possibility of tampering of EVM machines, which is being mentioned after the recent controversy
 agar is kitaab kii bikri bad gai to jiviel kii roylty bad sakati he vaise unka maananaa he ki ek chunavi visheshgy ke taur par unhone likhaa tha, party ke sadsy ke naate nahin
 The Election Commission has also rectified some of his questions
 ab unki waisi raay nahin he
 Voting was to be held in Delhi on 8 February 2015, on 3 February, Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that four EVM machines were found to be malfunctioning in Delhi Cantt, pressing any button in them used to vote for BJP
 march 2012 ke indian express kii report kii shuruyaat is line se hoti he ki iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad ko lekar vibhinn adaalaton main assi apil file kii gai hai
 What is the status of these 80 cases, we do not know
 express ke usee report main bijepi netaa kirit somaiya kaa bayaan chapa tha ki rajyon ke chunaav ayog ko iviem main sudhaar karnaa chahie taaki ise phulpruf banaaya ja sake
 In Bombay High Court, three Congress leaders filed an appeal that they accept their defeat but want evms to be foolproof
 chunaav se pehle unhen software ejeeniyar ne sampark kiya tha ki ham iviem main chhedchhad kar sakate hai
 In 2010, the Congress in Gujarat accused then Chief Minister Narendra Modi of tampering evms
 tab congress nikaay chunaavon main haar gai thi
 In 2012, the DC of Amritsar raised the issue with the state election officer about re-polling in some wards where some young people used wifi and Bluetooth to temper evms
 iskaa zikr captain amarinder singh ne 2012 main kiya tha
 In the same year, an independent candidate from Maharashtra asked the State Election Commission to check that at least where his and his family's votes went, how they got zero votes
 in udaahranon se saaf he ki iviem mashiinon ko lekar aarope lagane vaale congress ke bhi rahe hai, bijepi ke bhi rahe hai
 Leaders of regional parties have also imposed
 to iviem ko lekar shaq karne kaa kaam pehali baar na mayawati kar rahi hai na arvind kejariwal
 Mayawati said that she lost to Modi, not machine
 mayawati ne kaha he ki wo adaalat bhi jane vaali hai
 His party will celebrate Black Day on the 11th of every month
 mayawati ke mutabik ye wo taarikh he jis din loktantr kii hatya hui he
 Arvind Kejriwal held a press conference in Delhi and said that his party got one or two votes in many booths, while his number of voltaire is more than this
 kejariwal ne kaha ki 2013 main supreme court ne chunaav ayog se kaha tha ki sabhi vidhansabha chunaavon main iviem mashiinon ke saath aisi vyavastha ho ki batan dabaane par ek slip nikle jis par party kaa chunaav chinh ho
 It should be stored in a box
 taaki baad main vivaad hone par ginati kii ja sake
 Kejriwal said that this time this system was implemented in 32 places in Punjab
 upi main bhi kuch jagahon par hua he
 Kejriwal demands that such booths should be counted so that the evms and slip counts match whether the evms match
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiye
 EVM machines deteriorate
 karaab hona or unase chhedchhad kiya janaa donon alag alag hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 161 evms were found defective in Surat
 ye 20 april ke times of india main chapa he
 Questions have not arisen in India about EVM machine
 duniya ke kai deshon main iviem mashiinon ke khilaaf andolan chale hai
 There has been strong opposition
 unheen andolan kii chaaya main bharat main upi chunaav ke pehle sawaal karte rahe hai
 The comments america main 50 main se sirf 5 rajya main hi iviem kaa istamaal hota he, baaki har rajya main ballat se matdaan hota he
 In many countries of Europe, the ballot is held by ballot
 netherland ko iviem mashiinon kaa agua mana jaataa he, magar usne iskaa istemaal band kar diya he
 The court in Germany did not consider the use of electronic voting machines to be transparent
 zaruri nahin ki chunaav kahin ballat se ho rahaa he to yahaan ballat se hi ho
 How far would it be better to compare America's machine to India's machine
 kya donon kii technology ek hi hogi
 We do not know
 chunaav ayog ne tamaam ashankaon ko galat bataaya he or kaha he ki in mashiinon main dhaandhlee nahin ho sakati he
 Questions have also been raised earlier, but this time along with the questions, the way rumors are spreading, something must be done
 kyonki ab iviem ko lekar afvaah upi se aage ja chuki he
 In the civic elections of Maharashtra, this audacity got wind, which has been accelerated by the results of Punjab and UP
 isliye ayog ko do chaar pankti ke bayaan se aage jaakar kuch karnaa chahie taaki vyapak janata ke bich aise sawaalon ke liye jagah nahin bache
 If the worker of the losing party understands this basic thing, then he will be freed from fear and will be preparing for the next election
 bharat main ballat box se lekar electronic mashin par aarope lagate hai
 If the politics of EVM machine is to be understood then the best example of this is Captain Amarinder Singh
 pichley saal sitambar maheene main captain amarinder singh ne ek bayaan diya ki 2012 main chunaav haarane ke baad unhone mukhya chunaav ayukta ko likhaa tha ki iviem ke bare main vistaar se jaanch kii jaae
 How can it be made foolproof because some countries have started using ballot paper again
 congress ne punjab main lagaataar kaha he ki iviem phulpruf nahin he
 In September 2016, Captain Amarinder Singh again questioned evms and said government officials could tamper with evms
 isliye duusare rajyon se iviem mashine laayi jaaen
 What Captain Amarinder Singh said after winning elections in 2017 is funny
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi party haar se baukhala kar iviem main gadabadi kaa aarope laga rahi he
 Amarinder's three statements suggest that after he lost, he was questioning evms for fear of defeat, but after winning he became confident of evms
 udhaaharan captain sahab kaa diya he magar sawaal kai bade netaaon ne uthaaye hai
 On youtube you will find videos of BJP MP Subramanian Swamy tampering with EVM machines, in which he explains in detail how the main part of EVM comes from Japan, but the same Japan does not use EVM
 iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad kii sambhaavna ko lekar subrahmanyam swami mukhya cheharaa hai or ve adaalat tak is ladaai ko lekar gaye hai
 Jayalalithaa is no longer in the world but she moved to the Madras High Court in 2001
 aarope tha ki iviem main voter batan dabaata he lekin jab tak peethasin adhikari batan nahin dabaata, uskaa vot register nahin hota he
 The voter's vote will not be counted if the button is not pressed by the Presiding Officer for any reason
 jayalalita ne kaha tha ki raksha mantri jorge furnandis or em karunanidhi ne bhi iviem par sawaal uthaae the magar jeetne ke baad chup ho gaye
 In 2010, Telugu Desam Party leader Chandrababu Naidu said that evms can be tempered
 times of india kii agast 2010 kii ek khabar ke anusaar rajyasabha main bijepi or left ke netaaon ne iviem kaa masalaa uthaaya tha
 Arun Jaitley had demanded that the government should call an all-party meeting on this, also call some technical experts so that those doubts are cleared
 laal krishna adwani ne kaha tha ki puure vishwa ke anubhav ke anusaar aisi koi chiz nahin he jise temper pruf iviem kaha ja sake
 Meaning there is no machine that can be claimed that cannot be tampered with
 bijepi pravaktaa ji ve el narsimha raav ne iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad kii sambhaavna ko lekar ek kitaab bhi likhi he jiskaa zikr tazaa vivaad ke baad koob ho rahaa he
 gvl's royalties could increase if sales of this book went up, although he believes that as an election expert he wrote, not as a member of the party
 unke kuch sawaalon ko aage chal kar chunaav ayog ne sudhaar bhi kiya he
 They no longer have the same opinion
 dilli main 8 farvari 2015 ko matdaan hone the, 3 farvari ko arvind kejariwal ne twit kiya tha ki dilli kaint main chaar iviem mashiinon main gadabadi pai gai he, unamem kisi bhi batan ko dabaane par bijepi ko vot chalaa jaataa tha
 The March 2012 Indian Express report begins with the line that eighty appeals have been filed in various courts for tampering of EVM machines
 in 80 mukademon kaa kya states he, hamen nahin maaloom
 In the same report of the Express, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya's statement was printed that the Election Commission of the States should reform the EVM to make it foolproof
 bombai hai court main congress ke teen netaaon ne apil daayar kii ki apni haar to sweekaar karte hai magar chaahate hai ki iviem ko phulpruf banaaya jaae
 Before the election he was approached by the software engineer that we could tamper with the evms
 2010 main gujarat main congress ne tab ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par iviem mashiinon se chhedchhad kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The Congress was then defeated in the civic elections
 2012 main amritsar ke disi ne rajya chunaav adhikari ke paas yah masalaa uthaaya he ki kuch ward main dobaaraa se matdaan hon, jahaan par kuch yuva logon ne wifai or bluetooth kaa istemaal kiya taaki iviem ko temper kiya ja sake
 It was mentioned by Captain Amarinder Singh in 2012
 isi saal maharashtra ke ek nirdaleey ummidavaar ne rajya chunaav ayog se poocha ki isaki jaanch ho ki kam se kam unka or unke parivaar kaa vot kahaan gaya, unhen zero vot kaise mili hai
 It is clear from these examples that the accusers of EVM machines have also been from the Congress and also from the BJP
 kshetreey dalon ke netaaon ne bhi lagaae hai
 So neither is Mayawati nor Arvind Kejriwal doing the work of doubting evms for the first time
 mayawati ne kaha ki wo modi se nahin mashin se haari hai
 Mayawati has said that she is going to court too
 har maheene kii 11 taarikh ko unki party kaala diwas manaayegi
 According to Mayawati, this is the date on which democracy has been killed
 arvind kejariwal ne dilli main press conference kar kaha ki kai boothon main unki party ko ek yaa do vot milen hai jabaki unke volatinr kii sankhya isse adhik he
 Kejriwal said that in 2013, the Supreme Court had asked the Election Commission that in all assembly elections, there should be a system with EVM machines that a slip on the button will come out with the symbol of the party
 use ek bakse main jamaa kiya jaae
 So that it can be counted later when there is a dispute
 kejariwal ne kaha ki is baar punjab main 32 jagahon par yah system lagu kiya gaya tha
 It has happened in some places in UP as well
 kejariwal kii maang he ki aise boothon kii ginati honi chahie taaki pataa chale ki iviem mashin or slip ke ginati match karti he yaa nahin
 Keep one thing in mind
 iviem mashine karaab nikal jaati hai
 Being spoiled and manipulated is both different
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main surat main 161 iviem mashine karaab pai gayi thi
 It appeared in the Times of India on 20 April
 iviem mashin ko lekar bharat main hi sawaal nahin uthe hai
 There have been agitations against EVM machines in many countries of the world
 jabardast virodh hua he
 In the shadow of the same movement, there have been questions before the UP elections in India
 tippaniyan Only 5 out of 50 states in the US use evms, in every other state ballot voting
 europe ke kai deshon main matdaan ballat se hi hota he
 The Netherlands is considered a vanguard of EVM machines, but has stopped using it
 germany main adaalat ne electronic voting mashin ke istemaal ko paardarshee nahin mana tha
 It is not necessary that if the election is being held from the ballot, then it is from the ballot here itself
 america kii mashin kii tulana bharat ke mashin se karnaa kahaan tak thik hoga
 Will the technology of both be the same
 ham nahin jaanate hai
 The Election Commission has termed all the apprehensions wrong and said that these machines cannot be rigged
 pehle bhi sawaal uthe hai magar is baar sawaalon ke saath saath jis tarah se afvaahen fail rahi hai use lekar kuch kiya janaa chahie
 Because now the rumor about EVM has gone beyond UP
 maharashtra ke nikaay chunaavon main hi is aanshkaon ko hawa mili thi jise punjab or upi ke nateezon ne tej kar diya he
 Therefore, the commission should do something beyond the two four line statements so that there is no room for such questions among the wider public

 jayalalita ab duniya main nahin hai lekin 2001 main ve madras hoicourt chali gayi
 It was alleged that in the EVM, the voter presses the button but until the presiding officer presses the button, his vote is not registered
 agar kisi bhi vajah se peethasin adhikari se batan nahin dabaa to voter kaa vot gina nahin jayega
 Jayalalithaa had said that Defense Ministers George Fernandes and m Karunanidhi had also questioned evms but kept quiet after winning
 2010 main telegu desham party ke netaa chandrababu naidu ne kaha tha ki iviem ko temper kiya ja saktaa he
 According to a Times of India news in August 2010, BJP and Left leaders raised the issue of evms in the Rajya Sabha
 arun jetali ne maang kii thi ki sarkaar is par sarvadaleey baithak bulaaye, kuch takneekee visheshgyon ko bhi bulaaye taaki jo andeh hai unhen dur kiya ja sake
 Lal Krishna Advani had said that according to the experience of the whole world, there is no such thing that can be called Temper Proof EVM
 matlab aisi koi mashin nahin he jiske bare main daawa kiya ja saktaa he ki chhedchhad nahin ho sakati he
 BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao has also written a book about the possibility of tampering of EVM machines, which is being mentioned after the recent controversy
 agar is kitaab kii bikri bad gai to jiviel kii roylty bad sakati he vaise unka maananaa he ki ek chunavi visheshgy ke taur par unhone likhaa tha, party ke sadsy ke naate nahin
 The Election Commission has also rectified some of his questions
 ab unki waisi raay nahin he
 Voting was to be held in Delhi on 8 February 2015, on 3 February, Arvind Kejriwal tweeted that four EVM machines were found to be malfunctioning in Delhi Cantt, pressing any button in them used to vote for BJP
 march 2012 ke indian express kii report kii shuruyaat is line se hoti he ki iviem mashiinon main chhedchhad ko lekar vibhinn adaalaton main assi apil file kii gai hai
 What is the status of these 80 cases, we do not know
 express ke usee report main bijepi netaa kirit somaiya kaa bayaan chapa tha ki rajyon ke chunaav ayog ko iviem main sudhaar karnaa chahie taaki ise phulpruf banaaya ja sake
 In Bombay High Court, three Congress leaders filed an appeal that they accept their defeat but want evms to be foolproof
 chunaav se pehle unhen software ejeeniyar ne sampark kiya tha ki ham iviem main chhedchhad kar sakate hai
 In 2010, the Congress in Gujarat accused then Chief Minister Narendra Modi of tampering evms
 tab congress nikaay chunaavon main haar gai thi
 In 2012, the DC of Amritsar raised the issue with the state election officer about re-polling in some wards where some young people used wifi and Bluetooth to temper evms
 iskaa zikr captain amarinder singh ne 2012 main kiya tha
 In the same year, an independent candidate from Maharashtra asked the State Election Commission to check that at least where his and his family's votes went, how they got zero votes
 in udaahranon se saaf he ki iviem mashiinon ko lekar aarope lagane vaale congress ke bhi rahe hai, bijepi ke bhi rahe hai

 iviem mashin ko lekar bharat main hi sawaal nahin uthe hai
 There have been agitations against EVM machines in many countries of the world

 In the shadow of the same movement, there have been questions before the UP elections in India
 tippaniyan Only 5 out of 50 states in the US use evms, in every other state ballot voting
 europe ke kai deshon main matdaan ballat se hi hota he
 The Netherlands is considered a vanguard of EVM machines, but has stopped using it
 germany main adaalat ne electronic voting mashin ke istemaal ko paardarshee nahin mana tha
 It is not necessary that if the election is being held from the ballot, then it is from the ballot here itself
 america kii mashin kii tulana bharat ke mashin se karnaa kahaan tak thik hoga
 Will the technology of both be the same
 ham nahin jaanate hai
 The Election Commission has termed all the apprehensions wrong and said that these machines cannot be rigged
 pehle bhi sawaal uthe hai magar is baar sawaalon ke saath saath jis tarah se afvaahen fail rahi hai use lekar kuch kiya janaa chahie
 Because now the rumor about EVM has gone beyond UP
 maharashtra ke nikaay chunaavon main hi is aanshkaon ko hawa mili thi jise punjab or upi ke nateezon ne tej kar diya he
 Therefore, the commission should do something beyond the two four line statements so that there is no room for such questions among the wider public
 in udaahranon se saaf he ki iviem mashiinon ko lekar aarope lagane vaale congress ke bhi rahe hai, bijepi ke bhi rahe hai
 Leaders of regional parties have also imposed
 to iviem ko lekar shaq karne kaa kaam pehali baar na mayawati kar rahi hai na arvind kejariwal
 Mayawati said that she lost to Modi, not machine
 mayawati ne kaha he ki wo adaalat bhi jane vaali hai
 His party will celebrate Black Day on the 11th of every month
 mayawati ke mutabik ye wo taarikh he jis din loktantr kii hatya hui he
 Arvind Kejriwal held a press conference in Delhi and said that his party got one or two votes in many booths, while his number of voltaire is more than this
 kejariwal ne kaha ki 2013 main supreme court ne chunaav ayog se kaha tha ki sabhi vidhansabha chunaavon main iviem mashiinon ke saath aisi vyavastha ho ki batan dabaane par ek slip nikle jis par party kaa chunaav chinh ho
 It should be stored in a box
 taaki baad main vivaad hone par ginati kii ja sake
 Kejriwal said that this time this system was implemented in 32 places in Punjab
 upi main bhi kuch jagahon par hua he
 Kejriwal demands that such booths should be counted so that the evms and slip counts match whether the evms match
 ek baat kaa dhyaan rakhiye
 EVM machines deteriorate
 karaab hona or unase chhedchhad kiya janaa donon alag alag hai
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, 161 evms were found defective in Surat
 ye 20 april ke times of india main chapa he
 Questions have not arisen in India about EVM machine
 duniya ke kai deshon main iviem mashiinon ke khilaaf andolan chale hai
 There has been strong opposition
 unheen andolan kii chaaya main bharat main upi chunaav ke pehle sawaal karte rahe hai
 The comments america main 50 main se sirf 5 rajya main hi iviem kaa istamaal hota he, baaki har rajya main ballat se matdaan hota he
 In many countries of Europe, the ballot is held by ballot
 netherland ko iviem mashiinon kaa agua mana jaataa he, magar usne iskaa istemaal band kar diya he
 The court in Germany did not consider the use of electronic voting machines to be transparent
 zaruri nahin ki chunaav kahin ballat se ho rahaa he to yahaan ballat se hi ho
 How far would it be better to compare America's machine to India's machine
 kya donon kii technology ek hi hogi
 We do not know
 chunaav ayog ne tamaam ashankaon ko galat bataaya he or kaha he ki in mashiinon main dhaandhlee nahin ho sakati he
 Questions have also been raised earlier, but this time along with the questions, the way rumors are spreading, something must be done
 kyonki ab iviem ko lekar afvaah upi se aage ja chuki he
 In the civic elections of Maharashtra, this audacity got wind, which has been accelerated by the results of Punjab and UP
 isliye ayog ko do chaar pankti ke bayaan se aage jaakar kuch karnaa chahie taaki vyapak janata ke bich aise sawaalon ke liye jagah nahin bache

 The Indian Cricket Board's relations with the ICC, led by Shashank Manohar, have become bitter after the six points were deducted due to the Indian women's cricket team not playing a bilateral series with Pakistan from August 1 to October 31

 kya ham is sthiti main aa pahunche hai, kabhi sochiega ki nafrat karne se pehle kashmir yaa kashmiriyon ke bare main aap kya jaanate hai
 If you have opinions about Kashmir and Kashmiris from the propaganda spread of news channels and whatsapp University, then you should check yourself once

 Apart from this video, more must have happened back and forth
 kisi ko sadak se uthaakar is tarah peeta jane lage or uski pahchaan khoj kar ki ye kashmiri he, aap uski hataasha or bebasii ko nahin samaj sakate hai
 Because the news channels and the propaganda machinery of whatsapp University have destroyed your consciousness
 yah drishy kisi kashmiri ko maarane bhar kaa nahin he
 It is also that now some people will bring sticks with sticks and evict you from the identity and authority given to the Constitution of India
 jo saluk in kashmiri naujavaanon ke saath hua he wo aapke saath bhi hoga, balki isi prime time main bataaungaa ki jo kashmiri nahin hai unke saath bhi ho rahaa he
 i have no complaint with the color of his kurta, but i have three kurtas of this color

 If this is the case then they should explain that this color has now become political as well
 to vichaardhaara ko pahanakar jab bhi chalem aisi harakat na karen

 Uttar Pradesh Police has arrested four people in this case
 do vishwa hindu dal ke hai
 Two are from the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha
 jo bijepi kii yuva shakha he
 Our colleague Alok Pandey has visited these two Facebook profiles
 fasebuk profile se banjrang sonkar ke bare main kaaphi kuch pataa chalata he
 Bajrang Sonkar, leader of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, is the metropolitan head of the Vishwa Hindu Dal
 alag alag poj main bandook ke saath uski tasveeron ko dekhakar darane kii zarurat nahin he kyonki yahi bajrang sonkar jab samandar ke kinare tasviir kheenchaata he to bahen failaa letaa he
 Seeing the sea, why this generosity within him becomes so narrow, he starts thinking of aiming, it will be known only by talking with Bajrang
 uskaa yah post he ki ham hindu or sena ke liye lard rahe hai
 Bajrang Sonkar has shared the post on his Facebook page after the incident
 jisase pataa chalata he ki wo bhale alag dal main he magar uskaa sambandh bhartiya janata yuva morcha ke netaaon se bhi he
 Abhijat Mishra is the general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha
 daliganj ghatana main giraftaar himanshu avasthi kaa bhi ek post saajha kiya he ki vah ek channel ke dibet sho main gaya tha
 In that video, Ribik's dialogue is talking to Himanshu Awasthi
 yani himanshu avasthi itnaa bhi gumnaam shaks nahin he
 Lucknow police say that Bajrang Sonkar has committed crime many times
 hatya ke ek maamle main aaropee bhi he
 Still he wants to work for the army and Hindus in Facebook and Lucknow
 achche logon ko kise zarurat nahin hoti he
 Banjarang Sonkar has raised a question that we are fighting for Hindus and the army, how many people will support, so 548 comments have come
 kai logon ne bajrang kii aalochana kii he or kai logon ne saath dene kii baat kahi he
 Another accused is Himanshu Awasthi
 himanshu avasthi khud ko vishwa hindu dal kaa pradesh adhyaksh kehete hai
 Demonstrate openly their relationship with BJP
 fasebuk main himanshu avasthi ne khud ko bijepi kaa purv netaa bataaya he
 Himanshu Awasthi posted on March 6 at 2
36 pm that i will be live on Republic Channel
 phir 4 bajkar 44 minute par us video ko share karata he
 The third accused is Amar Mishra who works for the BJP
 soshal media profile se pataa chalata he
 Organizations are different but the thinking of these three is one
 himanshu avasthi kii yah tasviir bataati he ki vah ek ek eent jodne ke liye kitni mehnat kar rahaa he, kiske liye mehnat kar rahaa he
 He considers Modi brick as the most reliable brick and has written that if a house is built then Modi will be made of brick
 vishwa hindu dal ke rashtriya adhyaksh ne kaha he ki ve bijepi ke samarthak hai or bijepi ke sangrakshan main kaam karte hai bijepi ke liye kaam karte hai
 BJP spokesperson Hero Vajpayee has said that many people follow their ideology, action will be taken if the law is broken
 philhal chaaron giraftaar hai
 Before getting up in the media, Himanshu Awasthi had posted that you keep your life, i will keep my fire
 lagata he himanshu main ek acha shaayar hone kii sambhaavna ab bhi baaki he
 Otherwise, it is not possible to put such a good meter to keep life and life alive
 himanshu par lakhanvi mizaaj kii chhap dekhar mujhe kuch ummid nazar aati he
 What happened to Afzal Nayak and Abdul Salam was not right
 tab hua jab 23 farvari ko pradhanmantri tonk main kah chuke the ki hamaari ladaai kashmir se he, kashmiriyon se nahin
 Sonkars like Himanshu and Bajrang should listen to their leader properly
 netaa ko bhi apni baat in jaise naujavaanon tak thik se pahunchaani chahie
 In the past, what happened, the incident was small, it was big, what happened in any corner of India with Kashmiri children or not, this is not the issue
 is desh main aisa nahi hona chahie
 We do not pay attention to what the Prime Minister said while making the headline
 unki ninda yaa salaah kaa kya matlab rah jayega jab ve khud hi bolenge ki kya hua kya nahin hua mudda ye nahin he
 This is the issue
 or kya he mudda phir
 Afzal Nayak and Abdul Salam should not feel alone
 kyonki usee maarane waalon kii bheed main ek akelaa aisa bhi tha jo saamne aayaa or maarane waalon se kaha ki aap kyon maar rahe hai
 Resort to law
 kanoon haath main mat lijie
 Speaking alone has become a risky business
 isliye ham is sharif shahari kii tarif karte hai
 And now you take us to Muzaffarnagar where a single person was beaten for questioning
 ghatana 6 march kii he
 So many people are killing a young man together because he questioned the policies of the Modi government in a TV show
 media report main channel kaa naam nahin he, upi ke channel bharat samachar ke liye dibet ho rahaa tha din ke 11 baje
 India News is a Lucknow channel
 indian express ke anusaar kaarykram kaa naam tha maahaul banaae rakhie
 The Quint website has written that Adnan came from Saudi to test the Muzaffarnagar board
 kahin se aa rahaa tha to tivi dibet dekhakar ruk gaya
 became involved
 vahaan jaise hi sarkaar kii rojgaar, kanoon vyavastha se lekar krishi sankat par sawaal kiya tabhi vahaan maujuud log use khinch kar maarane lage
 According to Adnan, he was even called a terrorist
 media report main maarane waalon ko bijepi kaa kaaryakarta bataaya gaya he
 Which we are not verifying on our behalf
 indian express ke amit bhatnagar ne bharat samachar ke ankar narend pratap se baat kii he
 Narendra Pratap has said that he went to do a program among the youth in the nearby area
 kai tarah ke sawaalon par baat ho rahi thi
 Whenever someone used to say uncomfortable things, BJP workers used to cheer in favor of Prime Minister Modi and used to speak Bharat Mata ki Jai
 or adnan ko maarane lage
 It is not necessary to bring 100 numbers in the chemistry to understand when the crowd is forming, why it is being formed
 shukriya arshad jamaa or arshad pasha kaa jo vahaan se guzar rahe the or us bheed se adnan ko khinch laae
 If he had not been saved, he would have been killed
 rafaal maamle par hindu akhbaar ke en ram kii khoji report ko lekar supreme court me jo daleel rakhi gai vah daleel bhi us prakriya kaa hissaa he jo sawaal poochne ko tarah tarah se sandigdh kar rahi he
 In court, the Attorney General said that the secret file had been stolen
 usee ke aadhaar par report chhapi he
 Action should be taken against the newspaper under the Official Secrets Act
 indian express ne likhaa he ki atorni general ne da hindu or eenai donon kaa naam liya
 Remind you that the defense minister's statement came on 8 February, when the defense minister's notes were printed by n Ram
 us bayaan main unhone nahin kaha ki sikret file chori ho gai he
 Rather, she was saying that the journalist who printed the report did not print the entire note
 zaahir he us vakt wo file yaa nots nirmala sitaraman ke sangyaan main hogi
 And what a theft it was that ANI tweeted the entire document that n Ram raided
 press club of india or indian vimens press kor kii taraf se saajha bayaan aayaa he
 In this statement, the Attorney General in the Supreme Court has expressed deep concern
 unhone kaha tha ki di handu akhbaar main rafaal par chhapi report raksha mantralay ke chori kiye gaye dastauez par aadhaarit hai
 It has been said in open court that printing this report has threatened national security and is a criminal matter
 sarkaar main kanoon ke sabase bade adhikari ke is bayaan kaa asar na sirf media par hoga balki soochna ke liye sutron par nirbhar rahane vaale patrkaar bhi isse prabhavit honge
 The government's assertion that the Official Secrets Act has been violated hurts the basic concept of free press in a democracy like India
 chauthe stambh kaa kartavya he ki vah janhit main report kare or sawaal kare
 Whichever government it is
 yah behad durbhagyapurna he ki apana daayitv nibhaane par sarkaar ke bade adhikari kalankit kar rahe hai
 The Editors Guild has also issued a statement supporting n Ram and criticized the Attorney General's statement
 gild ne kaha he ki atorni general ne baad main kaha ki vakil yaa patrkaar ke khilaaf karrwai nahin hogi magar unka yah kahana ki report chori kii gai file ke aadhaar par he, chintaa kaa vishay he
 This will create fear in the media and affect the freedom to report
 oficial sikret act ke istamaal kaa koi bhi prayaas nindaneey he
 Journalists cannot be forced to disclose their source
 gild aisi dhamkiyon kii ninda karata he
 Appeals to the government to refrain from taking any action that affects media freedom
 rahul gandhi ne dastavej chori hone ke sawaal ko lekar press conference kii, ravishankar prasad ne jawaab main press conference kii
 There is a history of defense scams
 chand dastavezon ko hasil kar hi baat pehle saamne ai he phir aage badi he
 Taking out documents and printing news is not a mess of national security
 isse sena kaa manobal nahin girtaa he balki har sainik kaa manobal ooncha hota he ki bharat main ab bhi kuch patrkaar hai jo patrakarita karte hai talave nahin chaatate hai
 The reporting of n Ram would have boosted the morale of the army
 sena ke manobal kii baat hui he to aaj pulavama aatanki hamale main siarpief ke 44 shaheedon main se ek ke parivaar ke ek sadsy ne whats ap kiya
 Said that i am speaking brother of martyr Ajit Kumar Azad
 upi ke unnav zile ke purva tehsil ke rahane vaale hai ajit kumaar azaad
 After the martyrdom, the government gave everything to the family of Ajit Kumar Azad
 deree nahin hui
 Wife Nina Gautam has been given the job of assistant clerk
 jo ajit ji kaa vetanman tha usee vetanman par naukari mili he

 priyanka gandhi ne twit kar kaha tha, 'bharat main elisi bharose kaa doosraa naam he
 Common people invest their hard earned money in LIC for future security, but the BJP government is investing LIC money in loss making companies, shattering their trust
 ye kisi niti he jo keval nuksaan niti ban gai he?'congress netaa ajay maakan ne tab arabiai kii ek report kaa hawala dete hue daawa kiya tha ki pichley paanch saal main elisi ne 'jokhimavali' sarkari companiyon main apana nivesh doguna badhaakar 22
 64 lakh crores
 sarkaar yaa sarkari companiyon ko bachaane kaa itihaas puranahalanki sarkari companiyon ko bachaane kaa elisi kaa itihaas bahut purana he
 It has also been seen many times during the UPA era
 saal 2009 main manmohan singh ke kaarykaal main elisi ne kai bainkon main hissedari kharidi thi
 Subsequently, in 2010, LIC saved the government's honor by investing Rs 11,500 crore in disinvestment of public companies REC, NMDC and NTPC
 upie sarkaar kii izzat kai baar bachisal 2012 main jab isi tarah oengisi kaa vinievesh flop hota dikh rahaa tha, to antim samay main elisi sankatmochan banakar aayaa or usne 12,749 karod rupee lagaakar ofer kiye gaye sheyaron kaa 84 fisadi hissaa kharid liya
 It was then criticized by the Standing Committee on Finance, headed by BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, that it would hurt the interests of 29 crore policyholders
 modi sarkaar ke kaarykaal main bhi yah parampara jari rahi, jab saal 2014 main isane bhel kii badi hissedari kharidkar sarkaar ko raahat pahunchaai
 In the year 2015, the government had targeted to raise more than Rs 22 thousand crore from the disinvestment of Coal India, LIC also gave relief to the government by buying a stake of 7,000 crore
 saal 2016 main jab indian oil kaa vinievesh flop hota dikh rahaa tha, elisi ne isamen 8,000 karod rupee kaa nivesh kiya
 When the government disinvested the New India Assurance Company and General Insurance Corporation of India in 2017, LIC invested around Rs 13,000 crore in it
 march 2018 main jab hindustan aironautics kaa vinievesh ofer aayaa to elisi ne 2,900 karod ke nivesh se is ofer kaa 70 fisadi hissaa kharid liya
 How strong is LIC, how big is the size
 It is worth mentioning that LIC now has around 73% stake in the insurance business and the company has made a profit of Rs 13,000 crore in the last financial year

 In 2018-19, LIC has given a bonus of 50 thousand crores to its policyholders
 aankadon ke mutabik har saal elisi kareeb 20 lakh policy jari karti he
 About 25 crore people have taken about 30 crore life insurance policy from LIC

 aaj hamen lhasa main us mahal ko dekhne kaa mauqaa mila, jisamen chaudaven dalai lamas ne 1956 se 1959 tak kii teen garmiyaan bitaai thim
 This palace is built in Narbulinka
 narbulinka kaa matlab trager garden yaa trager park he, jise 18veen sadi ke madhya main saatven dalai lamas kelsang gaytso (kelsang Gyatso) ne banwaaya tha
 The park continued to grow and improve until the 20th century
 36 hectare main faile is park main alag-alag tarah ke 400 kamare hai
 In 1952, the palace for the fourteenth Dalai Lama began to be built in this park filled with green and flowers, which was completed in 1956
 ise dalai lamas ke samar pales ke taur par bhi janaa jaataa he
 Earlier the Potala Palace used to be the residence of the Dalai Lama
 kuch jaankaar bataate hai ki china kii sarkaar se anban ke chalate hi dalai lamas ko nae or apekshaakrit chote mahal main shift kiya gaya
 But some say this theory is wrong
 1959 main hi tibet main china ke 'democratic riform' ke virodh main dalai lamas ne tibet chhod diya or phir bharat main nirvasit jivan vyateet karne lage
 This palace has been empty since then
 haalanki ve tibeti jo china par tibet ko qabzaane kaa aarope lagaate hai unka kahana rahaa he ki china kii dabil kii vajah se hi dalai lamas ko tibet chhod bharat main sharan leni padi
 After this, the Chinese government has opened it to common tourists
 yahaan badi taadaad main dalai lamas ke anuyaayi bhi aate hai
 The good thing is that everything related to the Dalai Lama is kept here, except for a picture of him
 tirthayatri dalai lamas ke singhaasana se lekar unke baithne ke kamare tak main jaakar maathaa tekte hai
 Here we met a Tibetan woman who knew Hindi
 usne hamen dekhte hi india bolaa
 When we asked him about the Dalai Lama, he just said, wherever they are, stay fine
 yahaan hamen ek bade aakaar kaa vah radio bhi dikhaa, jise bharat ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ne dalai lamas ko tohafe main diya tha
 Interestingly, it is still in working condition, although it is being used only for exhibition
 nehru kii taraf se hi tohafe main mili ek badi si painting abhi bhi dalai lamas ke us kamare kii shobhaa badha rahi he, jisamen ve mehmaanon se mila karte the
 Like many of Lhasa's manestries, photography is forbidden in the inner rooms
 isliye ham aap tak in chizon kii tasviir nahin laa paa rahe
 However, you are shown a glimpse of the picture outside the palace
 ramayana ko aatmsaat karne se jivan main aa saktaa he badlavaramayan samskruti kii udghoshnaa karne vaala kavy nahin, isse kahin zyadabhasha kii maryaada se aage badhkar anek desh main pahunchaa ramayanakendriya grahamantri amit shah ne bhartiya saanskrithik sambandh parishad kii ore se yojit paanchaven antarrashtriya ramayana utsav main bolte hue kaha ki bhartiya samskruti ke prachaar-prasar ke sabhi uddeshyon kii purti ke liye ramayana manchan se acha koi kaarykram nahin ho saktaa
 He said that Ramayana epic has a lot of power and thousands of years of uninterrupted current flow expression is only through Ramayana
 grih mantri ne ye baaten ima (ol india management association) ke neshnal management kanvension ke dauraan kahin
 Amit Shah used to say that Ramayana is not just an event of a character
 maanviya jivan ke sari oonchaaiyon ko bhuule bagaiyr jivan ko rekhaankit karne kaa kaam maharishi valmiki ne kiya he
 He said that Maharishi Valmiki has also indicated the reasons for the downfall in the coming time
 amit shah ne kaha ki mahakavy main raja ke kartavyon kaa adarsh udhaaharan prastut kiya gaya he
 How much sacrifice, how much sacrifice can be made by the king to obey his father with patience is also shown
 unhone kaha ki raja ram ne puraa jivan maryaada main rahakar jiya
 Maharishi Valmiki has done the work of giving the life of Rama in poetic form
 unka kahana tha ki duniya kii sabhi bhashaaon main ramayana kaa bhavanuaad hua he
 Amit Shah also said that it is not only a proclamation of culture, poetry explaining ideal life, but inside it there are many such dialogues which also introduce ethics, administration, martial arts and knowledge science
 shah ne kaha ki ramayana se gyaat hota he ki jab stri kii maryaada kaa lop hota he tab rajya kaa lop hota he, samskruti kaa lop hota he
 Referring to Gandhiji, he said that when Kaka Saheb Kalelkar had to write the prologue of Kautilya's ethics in one sentence, Gandhiji had written that it is not a treatise, it is a text
 amit shah ne kaha ki isi tarah ramayana ko padhane ke baad vyaktigat jivan, saamaajik jivan tathaa desh kii sari samasyaon kaa samaadhaan isamen mil saktaa he
 He said that Ramayana has crossed the limits of languages and has become an ambassador of Indian culture in many countries
 hamaara desh bhi kitna ajeeb he
 Here, there is no freedom from one sin, that the other sin stands up with its head raised
 ham bhi kitne ajeeb hai, jo ham ek hi galati baar baar doharaate hai
 We don't need to say anything peeche likhe is naam se hi aap samaj gaye honge ki baat kis par ho rahi he
 Another name has been added to the line of Dhongi Babas
 aaropon ke mutabik ye nayaa baba pichley vaqt main guzare tamaam baabaaon se bhi chaar haath aage hai
