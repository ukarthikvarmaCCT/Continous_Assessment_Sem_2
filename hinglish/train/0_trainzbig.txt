 com / akenfjr0ud— FIFA World Cup 🏆 (@fifaworldcup)july 1, 2018rus ne 48 saal baad fifa world cap ke quarter final main pravesh kiya
 The hero of this victory of Russia was definitely his goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev, who made several great saves during the match and then made two saves in the penalty shootout and dived into the celebration at Lujaniki Stadium
 # ruslive on!the Luzhniki has exploded into a sea of celebrations
 The hosts are into the quarter-finals! # espruspic

 com / txt1ivxvdn — FIFA World Cup 🏆 (@fifaworldcup) July 1, 2018 The match was 1–1 on par with regular and extra time
 spain ne niyamit or atirikt samay main gend ko 79 pratishat samay tak apane kabje main rakhaa, lekin vah roosi rakshapankti visheshkar golkeeper akinfiv ko bhedane main naakaam rahe
 She took the lead in the 11th minute with a suicide goal from Sergei Ignashevich
 rus ko 41wein minute main penlti mili jis par ortem dajayuba ne barabari kaa gol kiya
 The winner was ultimately decided by a penalty shootout
 rus ke liye fedor samolove, ignashavitch, alexandra golovin or denis cherishev gol karne main safal rahe
 For Spain, Andrei Inista, Gerrad Pique and Sergio Ramos scored goals but both Kokay and Iago Espas' shots were beautifully blocked by Akinfeev
 rus (soviet sangh) ne isse pehle 1970 main antim aath main jagah banaai thi
 He will now face the winner of the match between Croatia and Denmark on July 7 in the quarter-finals
 lig charan main ajey rahe spain ne rus ke khilaaf satark shuruyaat kii
 Initially it seemed that both teams were trying to test each other, but Russia went on the backfoot with a suicide goal from Ignashevich in the 11th minute
 euri jhiricove ne roosi gol ke baayin taraf naacho ko gira diya jiske kaaran spain ko free kik mili
 Isco's freekick got Russian defender Ignashevich into trouble
 unhone gol bachaane ke liye sargiyo ramos ko bhi neeche gira diya lekin gend unki edi se lagakar gol main samaa gai
 Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev had no chance of stopping him
 spain ke captain ko laga ki gol unhone kiya he
 He also started celebrating but it soon became clear that the ball was hit by the foot of Ignashevich, not Ramos
 is gol se ignasevich (38 saal 252 din) world cap main sabase adhik umr main aatmghaatee gol karne vaali khilaadi bhi ban gaye
 Earlier the record was in the name of Neol Valadors (37 years 43 days) of Honduras who scored this goal in 2014 against France
 Love him or hate him, that aerial back-heel pass to Pique, after almost 110 minutes of football, was coolness personified from Ramos 😎 # espruspic

 com / 6ltefqc3yq— FIFA World Cup 🏆 (@fifaworldcup)july 1, 2018rus ne iske baad dabaav bhi banaaya
 In the 26th minute of the game Ignashevich tried well to make up for the mistake
 unhone golovin ko acha paas diya jo use acchhee tarah se nahin sambhaal paae or rus ne mauka ganvaa diya
 Golovin also had a chance in the 36th minute, but his shot went out close to the goal post in an attempt to lure two defenders
 iske baad haalanki jald hi rus ne barabari kar di
 Artem Dzuba's header collided with Gerrad Pique's hand on a corner kick that gave Russia a penalty
 spain ne iskaa virodh kiya lekin referi tus se mas nahin hue
 Dajyuba easily converted it into a goal and filled a new life at Luzhniki Stadium
 madhyantar tak donon timen 1-1 se barabari par thi
 Spain's team failed to upset Akinfeev in the first half
 duusare half main 59wein minute main digo costa ne isko ke saath milakar move banaaya, lekin puri roosi team gol bachaane ke liye aa gai
 Subsequently, in the 74th minute, Russia also showed their ability to save the goal, when the shot of Isco was saved by Fedor Kudryasov
 rus ne cherishev or samolove ko duusare half main utaara
 Apart from these two, Golovin was eyeing a counter attack
 duusari taraf costa kii jagah andres inista maidan par utar chuke the
 They made frequent attacks
 iniesta ne 85wein minute main gol kii taraf karaara shot bhi jamaaya, lekin akinfiv ne badi khubsuurati se iskaa bachaav kar diya
 No goals were scored in the second half and the match was stretched to extra time with the Spaniard team looking more composed and committed
 niyamit khel kii tarah atirikt samay main bhi gend roosi paale main hi mandaraati rahi, jiske khilaadiyon ne phir se apni takat gol bachaane par lagaai
 Akinfeev again made a great defense in the 109th minute to bring relief to the Russian supporters
 unhone rodrigo kaa shot gol main jane se bachaaya
 The ball on the rebound came to Dani Carvajal but her shot was stopped by Ilya Kutepov

 UP State Information Commissioner Hafiz Usman introduced the slogan of Jai Shri Ram to the people at an event in Moradabad

 During this time, he termed the divorce completely wrong
 unhone kaha ki teen kya main to ek talaak ke bhi samarthan main nahin
 During the program, he exhorted the Muslims of the country that during the india-pakistan match, they should raise slogans of Pakistan Murdabad

 Apart from Hafiz Usman, Moradabad District Officer, Commissioner and DIG were present on the stage

 Hafiz Osman, the chief guest, was invited to address and began his address, speaking on the RTI, suddenly appealing to Muslims in particular, and speaking on three divorces and saying that i oppose the triple talaq
 teen talaak to kya ek talaak bhi nahin hona chahie
 Muslims are unable to maintain their point
 itnaa hi nahi unhone manch se kaha ki agar india pakistan kaa cricket match ho to aap match na dekhen balki baahar nikalakar aayen or bekhauf hokar pakistan murdaabaad ke naare lagaaye
 Significantly, the chief guest sat saying all this, but the director of the program Sanjeev Akanshi, while disagreeing with the speech of the chief guest, termed him as wrong
 manch par baithe hafiz osman ne pehle to manch par rakhaa mike uthaaya lekin jab wo nahin chalaa to manch se uthakar podium par aa gaye or sanchaalak ko unki garima main rahane kii hidaayat dete hue saamne baithe logon se haath uthavakar samarthan ke liye bolne lagen

 But in the meantime, once again, State Information Commissioner Hafiz Usman took the mike from the District Officer and started raising the slogans of Bharat Mata Ki Jai, Hindustan Jai and Jai Shri Ram on Mike and saying that let's go fight now 
 RTI ke program main ye sab dekh log kuch samaj pate kii jila adhikari ne kaarykram khatm hone kii ghoshnaa kar di

 shailendra pandeya - jyotishi In India, now the election process is not limited to the rally and speech of leaders only
 whatsapp bhi chunaav main mahatvapurn role nibhaa rahaa he
 The Karnataka election was also contested on Kurukshetra in whatsapp
 jahaan donon pramukh partiyon bijepi or congress ne apane-apane daanv chale
 This was also seen in the Karnataka elections
 washington post ke anusaar, is baar desh kido badi partiyone daawa kiya ki unke 20 hajaar se zyada whatsapp group chal rahe hai
 Along with this, both the parties also claim to reach more than 15 lakh workers at any given time
 vahiin yah ap ab sirf kol, chat tak na simit hokar soochnaaon ke jariye vichaar banane main madad kar rahaa he
 However, whatsapp has become a platform where data is being shared without filtering
 yahi vajah he ki whatsapp ke jariye kaaphi sankhya main dharmik nafrat vaale massej or phek news bhi failaae ja rahe hai
 According to activists and experts, using whatsapp, an atmosphere is being created against the opposing parties
 raajnneetik virodhiyon ke bayaan ko jodtod kar vatsaip par share kiya ja rahaa he
 At the same time, messages spreading hate among Hindus and Muslims are also being shared
 bharat main chunaav ke dauraan phek news ko failane se rokane ke liye fasebuk ne fact checking website boom se saajhedaari kii he
 However, more steps have not been taken for misinformation spread through whatsapp

 aise main vatsaip ke inkripted massej jo company bhi nahin pard sakati he, vah loktantr ke liye kaaphi bada khatra he
 Especially in countries like India where crores of people have recently started using internet and they are not fully digital literate
 saath hi ye baatcheet privet grupon main ho rahi he, aise main galat soochnaaon ko sahi karne main kaaphi dikkat kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 According to Nikhil Pahwa, digital activist, it is almost impossible to know on whatsapp how to spread information
 aise raajnneetik partiyon ke liye galat soochna failaana kaaphi aasaan he or koi unhen iske liye jimmedaar bhi nahin tehra saktaa he
 The largest market is the largest market of whatsapp India
 yahaan company ke 20 karod yugers hai
 This is the reason that the company is trying to reach more and more people by launching new products like payment features etc
 haalanki vatsaip ke aane ke saath hi is ap ke kaaran kai jagah hinsak vaaradaaten hui hai
 a few weeks ago, 3 people were killed due to a rumor spreading on whatsapp in Tamil Nadu
 modi kii apni vatsaip senareport ke anusaar piem modi ne bhi soshal media prachaaron kaa jamkar istemaal kar 2014 ke chunaav main jeet hasil kii thi

 jahaan log vatsaip massej share kar uski satyata kii pushti kar sakate hai
 At the same time, governments in Egypt and Mexico have even made hotlines for complaints of dangerous fake whatsapp messages for the safety of the country and the public
 spam massej rokane ke liye kadam uthayega vatsapavatsap ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki sefti kii baat aane par company bure yaa khatarnaak yugers ko block karne jaise kadam uthaa sakati he

 According to the company, he has got a lot to learn from the Karnataka elections and it will prove effective in preventing spam messages going forward

 Hello, Ravish Kumar

 72 kii jagah 44 mantri hi bane hai
 It was specially mentioned in many newspapers that the choice of the Prime Minister has been done and the ministers have been appointed only on the basis of merit

 dilli chunaav ke vakt bijepi doctor harshavardhan ke bare main kya kya nahin kahati thi ki pulse polio ke nayak rahe hai
 Are honest
 jab ve swasthya mantri bane to jaankaron ne kaha ki sahi vyakti ko mantralay mila he
 He became the former Health Minister within five months
 congress pravaktaa ajay maakan ne kaha he ki harshavardhan kii jagah vakil je pi nadda ko mantri banaaya he, to kya sarkaar maanati he ki harshavardhan naakaam rahe
 The Aam Aadmi Party is not unhappy about Harsh Vardhan, but is happy about Nadda becoming health minister
 unka aarope he ki ames ke eemaandaar adhikari sanjeev chaturvedi ke tabadale kii sifarish karne vaale nadda ko swasthya mantri banaakar eemaandaar afasar ke saath ninsaphi hui he
 JP Nadda wrote a letter to Dr
 Harsh Vardhan in this month
 yah maamla sankshep main is prakaar he
 An investigation was against 1982 batch IAS Vineet Chaudhary, who had worked with Nadda in Himachal Pradesh
 sarkari record ke mutabik, nadda jab 2001 se 2003 ke bich himachal main swasthya mantri the to choudhary swasthya vibhaag main hi the
 The investigation against Vineet Chaudhary started in April 2013, soon after which Nadda wrote a letter to the then Minister of Personnel v Narayanasamy demanding Chaturvedi to be removed from the post of CVO of AIIMS
 13 agast ko chaturvedi ko ames ke sivio pad se hataane ke liye file noting taiyaar kii gai
 Within 24 hours, all the top officials of the Ministry of Health signed the file twice
 ames ke 250 doctoron or padam bhushan puraskaar praapt sadasyon ne piem ko khat likhaa tha ki sanjeev chaturvedi ko waapas laayaa jaae
 Congress and Aam Aadmi Party have fiercely questioned Nadda
 lekin vittamantri or soochna evam prasaaran mantri arun jetali ne bhi javaabi hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki koun kahata he ki unhone galat makasad se chitthee likhi
 Some people fit some organization, some do not
 yah hiton kaa takaraav kaise hai
 This is in the public interest
 kya unhone nijee hit main kiya
 Keep in mind that the privilege belongs to the Prime Minister and not yours
 phir yah dhyaan main bilkul mat rakhiegaa ki isi visheshadhikaar ke kaaran jab upie time main daagi mantriyon kaa jab maamla aayaa tha to bijepi ne sansad main unka bahishkaar kiya tha
 When he rose to speak, BJP mps would go out
 tab congressi kehete the ki politics main cese hota rahata he, ab jetali ne kaha ki politics main kai logon par cese hote hai
 Jaitley said that in UPA time, there were many cases of punishment
 upi main bijepi ke har kaaryakarta ke khilaaf cese he
 Arun Jaitley has clearly stated who used to be a minister in UPA
 pradhanmantri ke paas adhikaar nahin tha
 NDA is different
 pradhanmantri har kisi kii saakh kii checking karte hai ye kaise kah sakate hai ki ye daagi hai
 The Congress should confine itself to the poor governance it has given
 dimerit main merit nikaalnaa sarkaar kaa kaam he or merit main dimerit vipaksh kaa
 We also have some work in between which starts now in prime time
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke liye prachaar abhiyaan charam par he
 Bihar is also witnessing a tough competition in NDA and Grand Alliance in election rallies
 somvaar ko gaya sansadeey kshetra main rajd netaa tejasvi yadav ne ek jansabha ko sambodhit kiya or janata se modi sarkaar or nitish sarkaar ke khilaaf vot karne kii apil kii
 In Gaya, Tejaswi Yadav got to see a different style and he was seen communicating directly with the public
 tejasvi ne jansabha main maujuud bheed se poocha kya 15 lakh aapke khate main aae? kisaanon ko laagat mulya kaa dhai guna mila?tejasvi ne janata se poocha ki 'acha ye bataaie sharabbandi yani nasha mukti iske ham bhi pakshdhar hai lekin sharaab aaj kahaan nahin mil rahaa he, jo sharaab 200 rupee main miltaa tha, ab pandraa sau main bik rahaa he
 His share goes to Paltu Chacha's account
 baaluu bandi se faaydaa he ki ghaataa? pehle se baaluu sasta mil rahaa he yaa mahangaa? janata kaa jawaab hota he mahangaa
 As a child, we watched a film Chachi 420, but in real life we were brought up by Chacha 420
 'gaya main chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue tejasvi yah bhi kehete hai ki main aaj janata ke darbar main hum
 i am among you all
 janata ke darbar main tarikh par tarikh nahin padati, sirf faisalaa hota he
 i am standing in front of you (public) bowing your head, you are the owner
 You have to judge
 bas aap nyaay kijiega
 In fact, in the same way, now the leader of Opposition in Bihar and the star campaigner of Grand Alliance, Tejashwi Yadav is campaigning every day
 amuman har din 34 sabhaayen karne vaale tejasvi apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat pradhanmantri narendra modi par hamalaa bolkar shuru karte hai, jisamen unka jor is baat par hota he ki yah chunaav party yaa ummidavaar ko jitaane ke liye nahin he, balki samvidhan or aarakshan ko bachaane ke liye zyada he
 After that, to know the pulse of the stunning public, Prime Minister asks about the promises made by Modi in the last Lok Sabha election
 aksar jansabhaon main janata kaa jawaab nakaaratmak hota he or uske baad unke nishane par aa jate hai bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar, jinhen tejasvi yadav baar-baar palatu chachaa ke naam se jansabha main sambodhit karte hai
 At election rallies, Tejashwi Yadav repeats to the people what Nitish Kumar has once spoken against the BJP
 pehle nitish kumaar dwaara BJP ke bare main kai kai baton kaa zikr karte hai
 Let me tell you that Nitish Kumar had called BJP a rising Janata Party, not only this, he also said that i will never get along with the BJP
 chunavi sabhaaon main nitish kumaar kii inhen puraani baton ko tejasvi yadav doharaate hai
 Tejashwi says that Nitish Kumar has done the biggest deception of him and the people of Bihar
 iske baad tejasvi yadav apane pita lalu yadav kaa zikr karte hai
 They believe that the lack of Lalu Yadav is hurting everyone in this election
 wo chaahe unki party ho yaa phir janata
 In many public meetings in Gaya, the stunning people were seen explaining that in fact Lalu Prasad Yadav did not kneel in front of BJP, so he was kept in jail
 agar lalu yadav baahar aa jate to BJP aarakshan ke saath ched-chhaad nahin karti
 Tejashwi Yadav excludes Balakot, Pakistan and the military from his speech in his speech
 jansabhaon ke ant main tejasvi logon se hi 3 naare lagavate hai- bhaajapa bhagaao desh bachaao, berojgaare hataao aarakshan badhaao, majboor chachaa bhagaao bihar bachaao
 In this election, Tejashwi says when the Mahagathbandhan's associates and his party ask questions on the ticket for the fight, the time has gone, now everyone is in the campaign
 apane ghar ke antarkalah ke bare main kuch bhi bolne se bachate hai
 He says that the real issue is the promise of the Modi government, unemployment and not fulfilling the promises made in the last election

e
 for the third time in a row, he became the President of Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA), while Vijayvargiya got only half of the 73 votes from Scindia
 chunaav main vijayawargeey panel kaa ek bhi ummidavaar nahin jeet sakaa
 Scindia's decency and spontaneity in the MPCA elections while Vijayvargiya's sharp statements became a cause for discussion
 ek maukey par to vijayawargeey ne sindhiya ko congress kaa chota netaa bataa diya, to sindhiya ne unke bayaan kii hawa yah kahkar nikaal di, ‘’mujhe khushi he ki kailashji ne mujhe chota netaa kaha

 sindhiya ke samarthan main jis tarah se pradesh bhar ke congressi ekajute hue, usase saaf he ki bhavishya main ve pradesh congress main mahatvapurn jimmedaari sambhaal sakate hai
 This election was also Scindia's show of strength
 unke samarthan main kendriya mantri kamalnath or congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ke samarthak jute rahe
 Digvijay Singh had even called up MPCA members and urged them to vote for Scindia
 yahi nahin, saarvajanik taur par durlabh maukon par hi dikhne vaali indore kii purv maharani usharaaje holkar apane pati satish malhotra ke saath vot daalane ain
 Other members settled abroad, including Richard Holkar of the Holkar princely state, also made their presence felt
 is dauraan bijepi kaa koi bada netaa vijayawargeey ke saath khadaa nahin dikhaa
 Even a senior BJP leader alleged that Scindia did not have any political land in Indore, the credit for establishing them goes to Vijayvargiya
 ’’chunaav ke dauraan koi-na-koi vivaad chalata hi rahaa
 The membership of 20 members of the MPCA, including Jyotiraditya Scindia, Narendra Hirwani, was canceled by the Registrar Firms and Societies, which completed the legal process of membership of various institutions and clubs, citing legal flaws
 lekin indore hycourt ne chunaav ke din yani 26 agast ko unhen vot kaa adhikaar de diya
 Vijayvargiya is also the chairman of this Registrar of Firms Society, but his dice was also reversed here

 gopinathan ne 21 agast ko grih mantralay ko apana istipha saunpa tha
 The Daman and Diu Personnel Department has asked him to appear in office until his resignation is accepted
 chunki vah dadar or nagar haveli kii rajdhani silvasa main maujuud nahin the, isliye adhikariyon ne sarkari guestaouse ke daravaaje par notice chipka diya, jahaan vah rahata tha
 The notice, citing the rules of the Department of Personnel and Training (dopt), states that the resignation of a government official takes effect only when it is accepted
 'isliye aapako nirdesh die jate hai ki jab tak aapke istife par koi faisla naa ho jaae, tab tak aap apane pad kii jimmedaariyon nibhaate rahen

 unhone ram mandir ke sawaal par kaha ki jo kaary hona he vah hokar hi rahegaa use koi taal nahin saktaa he, niyati ne jo tay kiya he vah hokar rahegaa
 CM Yogi also targeted the SP-BSP alliance in a program
 madrason ke sawaal par yogi ne kaha ki madrason kaa aadhunikeekaran kyon nahi hona chaiye, vahaan ke bacchon ko aadhunik shiksha se kyon vanchit karnaa chaahate he
 Why do you want to limit them to religious education
 aadhunik shiksha sabhi ko di jaani chaiye
 It is in this context that we have also taken Madraso
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, while addressing the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), attacked Pakistan fiercely
 unhone kaha ki bharat apane padosi pakistan ke aatankwaad se peedit he
 Pakistan is not only adept at executing the terrorist incident, but also has expertise in denying it
 isaki sabase badi misaal he osama bin laden kaa pakistan main paaya janaa
 He said, 'the incident of September 11, 2001 is being seen as the biggest terrorist incident in the history of America
 isiilie is ghatana ke master mind osama bin laden ko america apana sabase bada dushman maanata tha or puri duniya main use khoj rahaa tha
 But the US did not know that Pakistan, the country which is said to be its greatest friend, is hiding it
 ye america ke khufia tantra kii safalataa he ki unhone osama bin laden ko khoj nikaala
 Swaraj said, "this is a feat of American military power, they killed him in Pakistan itself
" lekin pakistan kii himakat dekhie ki sara sach saamne aa jane ke baad bhi uske maathe par shikan nahin dikhi
 It seems as if Pakistan has not committed any crime
 pakistan kaa yah silsilaa ab bhi lagaataar jari he
 Targeting Pakistan for not taking action against Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai terror attack, the foreign minister said, "the mastermind of 9 / 11 was killed, but the mastermind of 26 / 11 Hafiz Saeed is still wandering open today
" vah reliyaan kar rahaa he, chunaav ladava rahaa he or saream bharat ko dhamkiyaan de rahaa he
 However, one thing is good that the world has recognized the terrorist face of Pakistan and that is why the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has put Pakistan on the watch list for funding terrorism
 'unhone kaha, 'ham par aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki ham pakistan ke saath baatcheet karne ke liye taiyaar nahin hote hai
 This is completely untrue
 hamaara to maananaa he ki duniya ke jatil se jatil mudde sirf baatcheet se hi sulajhaaye ja sakate hai or sulajhaaye jane bhi chahie
 That is why talks were started several times with Pakistan
 vaartaon ke anek daur bhi chale hai, lekin har baar pakistan kii harkaton kii vajah se vaarta rukii he
 'the foreign minister said,' Many political parties have come to India, but every government has tried to resolve our disputes through negotiations
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne to apane shapathgrahan samaaroh ke pehle hi saarc ke sabhi desh ke netaaon ko aamantrit karte sarkaar banane se pehle hi yah shuruyaat kar di thi
 i myself started a compulsive bilateral conversation by going to Islamabad
 kintu mahaj teen hafte baad pathankot airbase par hamalaa kar diya gaya
 He questioned the United Nations about how negotiations could proceed in such an environment
 'videsh mantri ne kaha ki pakistan main nai sarkaar aane ke baad vahaan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ne pradhanmantri modi ko patr likhakar yah ichha jataai ki agar neuyork main donon desh ke videsh mantriyon kii mulaakaat ho jaae, to acha ho jayega
 We accepted his proposal, but a few hours later, the Jammu and Kashmir Police personnel were kidnapped and then killed and thrown away
 unhone sawaal kiya ki kya ye harakatein baatcheet kii niyat ko darshaati hai? kya aise main vaataavaran main mulaakaat ho sakati he?videsh mantrisushamaa swarajane kaha, '20veen shatabdi ke baad yah ummid kii ja rahi thi ki yah 21veen sadi main shanti or samruddhi kaa yug prarambh hoga, lekin 9 / 11 ke neuyork kii ghatana or 26 / 11 ke mumbai kii aatanki ghatana ne in ummiido par pani pher diya
 Today, the monster of terrorism has reached every country of the world at a slow pace and at a very fast pace
 'swaraj ne kaha, 'bharat to kai dashakon se iskaa dansh jhelta rahaa he
 It is our misfortune that the challenge of terrorism has not come from far away country, but from our neighboring country across the border
 yah desh sirf aatankwaad failaane main hi maahir nahin he, balki apane kiye hue ko nakaarne main bhi usne maharath hasil kar lee he
 He said that on the day Pakistan accuses us of human rights violations
 jabaki hakeekat yah he ki maanavadhikaron kaa sabase ulanghan aatankwaadi karte hai
 They kill innocent people, but whom Pakistan advocates
 wo maarane waalon kii pairvi karata he or jo maare jate hai, un par chuppi saadh letaa he
 Making propaganda against India, alleging human rights violation by showing fake pictures has become a habit of Pakistan
 yah farji tasviir dikhaane kii ghatana pichley saal sanyukt raashtra mahasabha main hi ghati thi, jab pakistan ki pratinidhi ne uttar dene kaa upyog karte hue duusare desh kii tasviir dikhaakar bharat par maanavadhikaar ulanghan kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 He said that for the last five years, India has been continuously telling this forum that the issue of terrorism in only one list and another list will not resolve the issue
 jab tak ham aatankwaadiyon par kisi antarrashtriya kanoon kii giraft main nahin laaenge, tab tak yah silsilaa chalata rahegaa
 He said that India had proposed a proposal in 1996, which is still stuck
 iske atakane kaa sirf ek hi kaaran he ki ham aatankwaad kii paribhaasha par sarvasammati nahin bana paa rahe hai
 The complex problem is that we also want to fight terrorism, but who is terrorism, we cannot determine it
 unhone yahi vajah he ki duniya ke aatankwaadi duusare deshon main freedom fiter kahe jate hai or un aatankwaadiyon kii krurta veerta kahi jaati he
 The government of Pakistan removes postage stamps in his honor and honors women
 unhone kaha ki aise karnaamon ko sanyukt raashtra ke sadsy desh kab tak chupchaap dekhakar sehate rahenge
 If we do not go on time, then the day is not far when the demon of terrorism will swallow the whole world and the whole world will burn in this forest
 unhone kaha ki bharat vasudaiv kutunbakam main yakeen karata he
 He said that the United Nations should run like a family
 videsh mantri ne kaha ki sanyukt raashtra duniya kaa sabase bada manch hai, jahaan sabake dukh-sukh saajhe kiye jate hai
 Where plans are made for underdeveloped and less developed countries
 jahaan vishwa ko behatar banane ke liye lakshya nirdhaarit kiye jate hai
 In 2015, we set the goals of sustainable development, setting the agenda for 2030
 usee samay se yah kaha ja rahaa he ki agar bharat in lakshyon ko hasil kar legaa, tabhi ham safal ho paaenge, varanaa ham fail ho jaaenge
 He told the United Nations General Assembly, 'today i want to assure you that India will never let you fail
 varsh 2030 ke agenda or tikaoo vikaas ke lakshyon ko hasil karne ke liye bharat puri tarah patibaddh he
 The pace and scale at which PM Modi has undertaken many tasks to achieve these goals
 ham samay se pehle hi in lakshyon ko hasil kar lenge
 He said that the world's largest financial inclusion scheme is being run in India, which is named the Jan Dhan Yojana
 iske tahat 32 karod 61 lakh aise logon ke khate khole gaye hai, jinhone pehle kabhi bank kaa darwaja bhi nahin dekha gaya he
 Now the funds given by the government through direct benefit are directly deposited in their account
 iske kaaran garib ko puraa paisa milane laga he or bhrashtachar khatm ho gaya he
 India will never let the world fail on this issue
 unhone kaha ki iske liye modi sarkaar jandhan yojana or ayushmaan bharat yojana chalaa rahi he
 Ayushman Bharat Yojana will prove to be a milestone

 co / 5sptcijfdd — ANI (@ANI) September 29, 2018 He said that PM Modi has pledged for Swachh Bharat and Swasth Bharat
 jin viksit deshon ne prakruti kaa vinaash karke apana vikaas kiya he, unako isaki jimmedaari leni hogi
 They should not turn away from it
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad or jalwaayu parivartan aaj sabase badi samasya he
 Earlier on Thursday, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told members of the BRICS group that there should be no differences among members on important issues to achieve long-pending reforms in the UN Security Council and they should speak strongly on this issue 
 sanyukt raashtra mahasabhake 73wein satr se itar bricks ke videsh mantriyon kii baithak ko sambodhit karte hue swaraj ne kaha ki brazil, rus, bharat, china or dakshin africa ke paanch sadasyeey samooh kii shuruyaat ek dashak pehle antarrashtriya sanghathanon main yathasthiti khatm karne or bahupakshavaad kii vikrutiyon ko sudhaarney ke liye hui thi
 He said that the call for multilateralism after a decade should not be to strengthen this status quo but to change it
 swaraj ne kaha, ‘vyapak str par, agar bricks ko zyada majboot hokar ubharna he, to hamen aane vaale varshon main saajhe sarokaar ke muddon par behatar samaj or sahmati viksit karnaa hogi
 Referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for reform in multilateralism, he said that the most important agenda for reform of the Joint Security Council is still incomplete
 bataa den ki bharat lambey samay se sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad main sudhaar or apni sadsyta kii maang kar rahaa he
 The Foreign Minister said, 'discussion on reform in the United Nations Security Council cannot be an exercise for eternity
 suraksha parishad kii vaidhata or saakh lagaataar kam ho rahaa he
 Instead of being divided among the important areas of international governance in BRICS, we should put forward our voice in a stronger voice
 ’swaraj ne aatankwaad nirodh par sanyukt karrwai ke liye bricks deshon kii ranneeti ko rekhaankit karte hue kaha, ‘aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke samarthan ke buniyadi dhaanche ko dhwast karnaa pehla kadam hoga
 Terrorist organizations like lashkar-e-taiba, ISIS, al-qaeda, jaish-e-mohammed, Taliban and Haqqani Network are organized gangs that thrive on government support
 ’videsh mantrine bricks deshon se aagrah kiya ki ve aatanvaadiyon or unke sanghathanon ko soochibaddh karne ke liye sanyukt raashtra ke aatankwaad nirodhi tantra ko behatar banane ke liye haath milaayein
 He said, 'implementation of FATF (financial Action Task Force) standards in all jurisdictions will strengthen international efforts in combating terrorism
 ’is baithak main brazil ke videsh mantri alloysiyo noons ferera philho, rus ke videsh mantri sarjei lavrao, china ke videsh mantri wang yi or dakshin africa kii videshi sambandh evam sahyog mantri lindive sisulu shaamil hue
 Swaraj said that BRICS took many effective steps in the last decade and to take it forward, this platform of five countries needs to be strengthened further

 With this, questions are also being raised

 All the mainstream political parties in the Valley have asked the Election Commission that when there is an atmosphere for holding Lok Sabha elections, why not for the Assembly? But according to experts, it would have been difficult to conduct assembly elections in today's environment
 neshnal conference ke netaa faruk abdulla ne kaha he ki sabhi dal chaahate hai ki rajya main ekasaath (loksabhaa or vidhansabha) chunaav hon
 The atmosphere is right for the Lok Sabha elections, so why not for the state elections? Local elections were completed peacefully here, adequate security forces are deployed in the valley, yet why are the state elections not being conducted? At the same time, former Chief Minister and PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti has said that not letting people elect the government is against the idea of democracy
 iske alaava ek agenda ke tahat logon ko alag-thalag karne ke liye samay lene kii ranneeti par kaam kiya ja rahaa he jo unke (centre sarkaar) paroksh uddeshyon ke anuroop he
 The Election Commission has decided not to hold the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections citing security
 isse pehle chunaav ayog kii ek team jammu-kashmir main halaat kaa jayja lene gai thi
 Senior journalist and close watchdog of Jammu and Kashmir politics, Rahul Jalali says that the action that is taking place after the Pulwama terror attack has started a series
 ise roak kar vidhansabha chunaav karaane main dikkat aa sakati he
 There will be more candidates in the Vidhan Sabha elections than in the Lok Sabha, so in today's environment it could be difficult to protect everyone
 bataa den ki jammu-kashmir main loksabhaa kii 6 seat or vidhansabha kii 87 site hai
 JNU professor Amitabh Mattu believes that due to security reasons, assembly elections in 87 seats of the state may be difficult
 lihaaja chunaav ayog ek baar main ek kadam uthaanaa chahta he
 For example, first by holding Lok Sabha elections, if the situation is good then assembly elections will be held

 Amitabh Mattu says that it would have been good if there was a democratically elected government in the state
 lekin agar matdaan kaa pratishat bahut kam hota jisaki ummid zyada he to vidhansabha chunaav ek majaak banakar rah jaataa
 The mainstream parties in Jammu and Kashmir are presenting the decision not to hold assembly elections as a defeat of democracy
 aise main varisht patrkaar rahul jalaalee kaa kahana he ki ye vahi dal hai jinhone panchayat chunaav kaa bahishkaar kiya tha, tab inhen loktantr kii yaad kyon nahin ai
 These parties, which have been in power for decades, could not implement even the 73rd and 74th amendments
 jiske tahat panchayaton or nikaayon ko takat milti
 While the Election Commission said in its press conference on Sunday that despite having panchayat elections in the state, elected representatives are forced to stay in government bungalows for security reasons
 haal ke dinon main ghati main algaavvaadi takaton ke khilaaf lagaataar karrwai ho rahi he
 These are the same forces which motivated the public not to participate in the democratic process
 rahul jalaalee kaa maananaa he ki algaavvaadiyon par karrwai kaa asar jald nahin dikhegaa kyonki inaki prashasan, skool or anya sansthaaon main paith he
 Therefore, it may take 5 to 6 months to see its effect
 lekin sarkaar or siyaasi dalon ko algaavvaadiyon ke vikalp par bhi gambhirtha se vichaar karnaa hoga
 Rahul Jalali believes that the Election Commission must have given some hint for the assembly elections

 Raja Bhaiya, who has been involved in many crimes, has always shown a rage during the Samajwadi Party (SP) rule
 abhi tak mayawati hi iklauti aisi mukhyamantri hai, jinhone na sirf raja bhaiya ko jail main daalaa, balki un par aatankwaad nirodhak kanoon (pota) bhi lagaaya
 No courage to arrest? Raja Bhaiya's resignation from the post of Food Minister was taken after the name of CO murder case, but Akhilesh Yadav government is unable to show courage to arrest him
 khud sapa ke kai netaa dabi jubaan kah rahe hai ki raja bhaiya ke khilaaf kadi karwai honi chahie, lekin siyaasi rasookh or party adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav se nikatataa ke kaaran philhal raja bhaiya kii giraftaar mushkil lag rahi he
 SP government is protecting Raja Bhaiya? State spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Vijay Bahadur Pathak says that when Raja Bhaiya is arrested for conspiracy to murder CO, why is his arrest not happening? The attitude of Akhilesh government in this matter is clear that she wants to save Raja Bhaiya
 kunda kshetra se lagaataar 5 baar vidhayakaraja bhaiya kunda vidhansabha kshetra se lagaataar paanch baar se vidhayak hai
 Raja Bhaiya supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 1993 and 1996 assembly elections, and was elected as an Independent candidate supported by the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 elections

 Chief Minister Mayawati once again put him in jail on charges of attempting to kill a candidate in a swindle violence during the Panchayat elections in 2010
 kareeb ek saal tak raja bhaiya jail main band rahe
 Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Ram Achal Rajbhar says that sister-in-law (mayawati) does not tolerate hooliganism and criminal elements at all

 The case of mining lease of iron-ore in Jharkhand is catching on
 cabinet kii baithak main is mudde par varisht mantri sarayu raay yah kahkar nikal gaye ki niyamon ko taak par rakhkar jo mining lij phir se navinikaran kiye ja rahe hai ve galat hai or bhavishya main is maamle kii jaanch jarur hogi or vah jail nahin janaa chaahate
 Saryu Rai is the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Food Consumers of the state and he says that the issue which was considered in the cabinet and the consent of mining was given, if not today, there will be a dispute and everyone will come to the point of inquiry though this dispute At the root of this is the last cabinet meeting, in which the decision to renew the lease of 104 mines of the state was taken
 raay kaa kahana he ki navinikaran karnaa vibhaag kaa kaam he or yah mining vibhaag ke dwaara karnaa chahie tha, lekin jab kuch mantriyo ne kaha ki yah faisla ek baar ho gaya he tab is par punarvichaar kaise kiya ja saktaa he
 Rai then argued that there could be amendment in the constitution, so why not amend the cabinet decision
 darasal yah maamla pichley do varshon se chal rahaa he or nae act ke anusaar sarkaar ko ekstansion dene kaa adhikaar he, lekin mining company dwaara kisi tarah ke ulanghan kii shikaayat nahin honi chahie, lekin shah ayog ne jharkhand kii mining companiyon ko kai bindu par ulanghan kaa doshi paaya tha or unke upar kareeb 1200 karod kii penlti lagaai thi
 Later, the development commissioner of Jharkhand also found the mining companies guilty in their investigation, but the case went to the Jharkhand High Court where the government's counsel argued against the government's decision, but the court directed the government in its decision Given that they could allow mining to end the violation
 tippaniyan The tension of the government is that due to the rule of law, the mining activity in the state is stagnant and the state is also losing revenue, but Saryu Rai says that if the government takes action with the law, then someone will get stuck in the future There will be no scope sarayu raay bijepi ke un varisht netaaon main se ek hai, jo ekikrut bihar main chaara ghotaalaa ho yaa jharkhand main madhu kodaa kaa mining ghotaalaa sabhi ko ujagar karne main unki ek ahm bhoomika rahi he isliye sarkaar khaskar mukhyamantri raghubar das unke upar koi ulta hamalaa nahin bol sakate
 Currently, the Jharkhand government is now trying to put a stop to the controversy that started this entire matter with the consent of the Law Department, but in the coming days, in Jharkhand, an issue was found sitting in the opposition parties, but this matter also once again go to court

 Actually this case has been going on for the last two years and according to the new Act, the government has the right to give extension, but there should be no complaint of any violation by the mining company, but the Shah Commission has violated the mining companies of Jharkhand on several points
 And was fined about 1200 crores
 baad main jharkhand ke vikaas ayukta ne bhi apni jaanch main mining companiyon ko doshi paaya tha, lekin yah maamla jharkhand ucch nyaayalay main chalaa gaya jahaan sarkaar ke hi vakil ne sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf jirah kii, lekin court ne apane faisle main sarkaar ko nirdesh diya ki ulanghan ko khatm kara ve mining kii anumati de sakati hai
 The comments sarkaar kaa tanaav yah he ki niyam kanoon ke chakkar main rajya main mining gatividhi thap padi hui hai or rajya ko rajasav kii haani bhi ho rahi he, lekin sarayu raay kaa kahana he ki sarkaar agar vidhi samet karrwai kare to bhavishya main kisi ke funsane kii gunjaaish nahin rahegi
 Saryu Rai is one of the senior BJP leaders who have played an important role in exposing everyone to the fodder scam in Unified Bihar or Madhu Koda's mining scam in Jharkhand, so the government especially Chief Minister Raghubar Das has no backlash on him

 Meanwhile, the party may ask the high command to settle the issue to calm Saryu Roy's attitude

 On the last day of the budget session of the 16th Lok Sabha, something happened that gave rise to new speculation in Indian politics
 samaajawaadee party ke sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ne apane antim bhaashan main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko vartmaan kaarykaal ke liye badhai di or kaha ki unki kaamana he ki aap phir pradhanmantri bane
 When Mulayam was making a statement, the atmosphere of the house changed completely
 unke bagal main baithi upie cheirperson sonia gandhi kaa chehre kaa bhav bhi ek dam badla or vah idhar-udhar dekhne lageen
 When Mulayam Singh Yadav stood up, he started his address, saying that he wished that the mps here should win again
 is par sadan main thahaake lage to sonia gandhi bhi muskura deen
 But after some time he said that we (opposition) are few in number, so he wished that you (narendra Modi) be the Prime Minister
 mulaayam ke is bayaan ke baad sonia gandhi kuch der ke liye asahaj huin or idhar-udhar dekhne lageen
 However, later she smiled lightly
 vahiin, duusari taraf satta paksh kii ore baithe saansadon ne taaliyaan bajaain or jai shri ram ke naare bhi lagaae
 While Mulayam Singh Yadav responded to this congratulation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with folded hands and greeting
 gauratlab he ki ye pehla mauka nahin he jab mulaayam singh yadav or narendra modi ke bich kii ye dosti duniya ke saamne ai ho
 Even before this, Narendra Modi has praised Mulayam Singh Yadav many times, so the conversation between the two in Cannes became a topic of much discussion when Yogi Adityanath was taking oath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav se niyam todane ke aarope main chunaav ayog ne jawaab maanga he
 The notice sent to Akhilesh Yadav has been asked to clarify the statement in which he said that take the money the most, but vote cycle
 akhilesh ko aaj shaam tak is notice kaa jawaab dena he
 Earlier, the Election Commission reprimanded Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar for saying the same thing during the campaign in Goa
 samaajawaadee party ke supremeo ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya gaya
 In fact, on March 4 in Bhadohi, Akhilesh had allegedly told voters to take money from someone else but vote for the bicycle which is his party's election symbol
 ayog ne unhen prathamdrishtya adarsh aachaar samhita ke ulanghan kaa doshi pate hue kaha ki 7 march tak bataaen ki kyon nahin unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaani chahie
 Akhilesh had said, i heard that money is being given to voters
 meri aapako salaah he ki dhan rakh lijie or cycle par vot daaliye
 The commission told them that bribing voters and abetment to take bribe is a punishable offense
 tippaniyan Earlier on Monday, at a rally in Jaunpur, Akhilesh Yadav attacked PM Modi fiercely
 unhone kaha ki piem ne ab bijli ko bhi hindu musalmaa bana diya he
 He said that PM Modi is doing a road show, if he had fulfilled the promises made to the people of Banaras then there would not have been such a roadshow

 dhawan5) on Oct 29, 2017 at 12:54pm PDT There has been a new twist in the case of giving acid to a schoolgirl in Kalkaji area of delhi
 doctoron kii report or auto chaalak ke bayaan ke baad police kaa shaq gaharaa gaya he ki gharavaalon se jhagade ke baad chaatra ne khud hi tejaab pi liya tha
 The investigation of the case is currently going on
 police ke mutabik, guuruuvaar subah kalka ji kii ek schuli chaatra ko auto se aspataal pahunchaaya gaya
 Auto driver Taufiq said that the girl was vomiting on the way
 ladki auto chaalak toufeeq se pet main dard hone kii baat kah rahi thi
 If Taufiq believed, the girl did not talk about forcibly drinking acid
 peedita kii maa ko ghatana kii soochna di gai
 After which the victim's mother created a ruckus at the Nesfadarjung Hospital
 maa ne aarope lagaaya ki uski beti ko do ladakon ne jabaran tejaab pilaayaa he
 The victim's mother said that her daughter had been troubled by two boys for several months and that she had given her daughter acid
 peedita kii maa kii shikaayat par police ne fouran maamla darj kar liya
 Meanwhile, the police also received a doctor's report, in which there were no signs of acid burning anywhere on the girl's body or clothes
 doctoron ne police ko bataaya ki agar kisi ko jabaran tejaab pilaayaa jaae, to uske sharir par kahin naa kahin to jalane ke nishaan jarur milane chahie
 But the doctors found no such thing in the investigation of the girl, to say that the victim girl has been impregnated
 philhal ladki kii haalat khatre se baahar he
 Police will soon record the statement of the victim girl
 ladki ke bayanon ke baad hi police aage karrwai kii baat kah rahi he
 Former Union Minister Arif Mohammad Khan, who is fighting to make the triple talaq a crime, said on Friday that if it was not done, the Modi government would also make the same mistake that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had done in the Shah Bano case
 congress kaa naam liye bina khan ne kaha ki jo party 1984 main 400 se zyada siton par jiti thi vah ‘besahaara ke shraap' ko bhugat rahi he
 He said, "what was given to Shah Bano?" 147 rupees / curse of that destitute is behind them to keep their body and soul together
 ''khan ne kaha ki unhone pradhanmantri narendra modi ko pichley saal oktober main chah panne kaa patr teen talaak ke chalan ko aparaadh tehraane ke aagrah ke saath likhaa tha
 Arif Mohammad Khan was giving a lecture in Delhi on "why should triple talaq be made a punishable offense"
 khan 1986 main rajeev gandhi kii sarkaar main rajya mantri the lekin unhone shah bano maamle main sarkaar ke rukh ke khilaaf istipha de diya tha
 Shah Bano was a Muslim woman from Indore who was divorced by her husband in 1978
 iske baad usne adaalat main iske khilaaf aapraadhik maamla darj karaayaa or apane pati se guzaara bhatta paane kaa maamla bhi jeet gai
 The decision of the lower court was challenged by her husband in the Supreme Court but the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the lower court
 haalanki iske baad tatkaaleen rajeev gandhi sarkaar muslim mahila(talaak par adhikaron kaa sangrakshan) vidheyak lekar ai or kanoon banaakar adaalat kaa faisla palat diya
 Pakistan has started an exercise to improve relations with the new government of India
 pakistani akhbaar da express tribune ne islamabad se yah khabar di he
 The newspaper wrote that Pakistan's Ambassador to India Abdul Basit is quietly in touch with the BJP
 pakistan bharat kii nai sarkaar se sambandh sudhaarney ke icchhuk hai or usase sarthak baatcheet karnaa chahta he
 But in view of the sensitivity of the case, the newspaper has not given the names of the BJP leaders whom the Pakistan Ambassador has talked to
 bharosemand sutron ne akhbaar ko bataaya ki haalanki piem candidet narendra modi ke pakistan ke khilaaf bayanon ke baavjood vahaan ke rajdoot ne apane pradhanmantri ko ek sandesh diya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki navaj sharif kii sarkaar bijepi sarkaar ke saath milakar nai shuruyaat karnaa chaahati he
 An important person aware of the matter told the newspaper that the message was conveyed to the BJP that the present government of Pakistan is working on the principle of economic development and peaceful neighborhood
 isi siddhant ke tahat islamabad bijepi se sarthak vaarta kii icchhuk he
 The source also said that the Pakistani Foreign Office is hopeful after initial contact with the BJP
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jis tarah se pakistani pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne modi kii jeet ke baad unhen phone kiya or badhai di usase ummiden bandha gai hai
 After the BJP government came under the leadership of Modi, it was believed that the new government of India would take a tough stand against Pakistan
 lekin pakistani pradhanmantri ke rashtriya salaahkaar sartaaj ajij ne kaha ki bijepi kaa spasht bahumat use nirnaayak or positive faisle lene main madad karegaa
 The bjp's manifesto is about development and good relations with neighbors
 unhone kaha ki hamaari bhi yahi niti he
 Therefore, there is no contradiction between the two
 pakistani videsh mantralay ke ek adhikari ne akhbaar ko bataaya ki pakistan bharat kii nai sarkaar se behatar rishte banane ke liye taiyaar he
 But this will depend on India's stance
 adhikari ne bataaya ki pakistan ne iske liye ek package bhi taiyaar kiya he
 He will give this package after the formation of a new government in India
 usne yah bhi bataaya ki iske liye home work ho chukaa he
 But right now Pakistan is in the position of weight and watch

 h Vishwanath said that he has asked party president and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda to accept his resignation
 vishwanath ke mutabik devgauda ne unke istife par faisla kaaphi dinon se lambit rakhaa he
 It is worth noting that in Karnataka, JDS state president h Vishwanath resigned from the post of president taking moral responsibility for the party's poor performance in the recent Lok Sabha elections
 loksabhaa chunaav main jedies ko maatr ek seat par jeet mili thi
 Vishwanath had said that Congress lost 20 seats and failed to retain 9 out of 10 seats
 jedies 6 siten haar gai
 The two seats we won in 2014, we could retain only one seat yah baat hameshaa se jagajaahir rahi he ki ek padosi duusare kii tarakkee se shaayad hi khush hota he
 This is also seen in the case of China
 bihar ke nalanda ke ek kisaan ne dhan kii paidaavaar kaa vishwa record kya bana liya, yah baat uske gale hi nahin utar rahi he
 Euan Longping, popularly known as Father of Rice Hybrid of China, has questioned the record of Sumant Kumar, a farmer from Nalanda
 laungping ke mutabik, bagaiyr rasinic khaad or hybrid ke itani paidaavaar sambhav nahin he
 Sumant has responded, calling it a blasphemous remark
 sumant kaa kahana he, ''meri upaj kaa akalan khud main nahin balki sarkari adhikari, krishi vaigyanikon or pratinidhiyon kii maujuudagi main kiya gaya he
 "not only theirs but the yield of four other farmers of the village has also been recorded more than the established records of China
 sumant apane pichley record ko 2012-13 main paar karne kii yojana main the, lekin sarkari kaaryakramon main vyast rahane or aswasth ho jane kii vajah se ve apane mansoobey main kaamyaab nahin ho sake
 As such, it is difficult to get record yield in the same field again, but it is possible to record the crop in the same field after a gap by adopting the crop cycle
 is saal bhi gaanv ke sanjay kumaar ne prati hectare 140 quintal or vijay kumaar ne 130 quintal dhan paidaa kiya he
 This yield has occurred when the crop cycle has not been followed and the weather has been unfavorable
 jahaan tak rasinic khaad or hybrid ke istemaal kii baat he, yah kisi se chhipi nahin he
 Hybrid arises 6444 and minor chemical fertilizers have been used
 sabase zyada hari khaad or organic khaad kaa upyog hua he, jo sarkari record main he
 Sumant says, "if you want Longping come to their village Darveshpura and see my farming, they will be welcome
 ye unki ishya he, jo apane se adhik paidaavaar karne vaale ko ve pachaa nahin paa rahe hai
 "soil of Darveshpura has also been suitable for record yields," says Rajiv Ranjan, an expert in the agriculture department
 ''sumant ne 2011-12 main is karname ko anjaam diya tha
 The record yield made Sumant a hero among the farmers in the country and the world
 isi saal 15 janvari, 2013 ko raashtrapati pranav mukherjee ne unhen krishi karman award kaa prashasti patr or ek lakh ru
 Honored by giving a check of china ke yuan laungping ne prati hectare 194 quintal record fasal paidaa kii thi, lekin 2012 main nalanda ke sumant kumaar ne prati hectare 224 quintal dhan kaa record bana kar pichley saare record dhwast kar die
 Longping did not have a record on this record and questioned
 lekin gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki haal hi main bihar daure par aae nobel puraskaar vijeta joseph stiglitz ne bihar ke kisaanon ko vaigyanikon se bhi hoshiyaar bataaya he

 uttar pradesh main sattarudh samaajawaadee party (sapa) or satta se baahar hui bahujan samaaj party (basapa) ne brahmanon ko ghar kaa devtaa bana diya
 Both parties believe that Brahmins hold the key to power
 sapa ne elaan kiya he ki mayawati ke shasankaal main brahmanon par darj saare mukademe waapas honge
 Brahmins would never have received so much respect on Parashuram Jayanti as this time
 sapa ne party mukhyalay par brahman sammelan dhooma-dham ke saath manaaya, jabaki basapa ne maharajaganj main brahmanon kaa sammelan kiya
 Both the parties opened their doors to the Brahmins and claimed that only they give respect to the Brahmins with all their heart and the other parties humiliate them
 donon hi dalon ne party line se upar uthakar brahmanon ko apni naiya kaa khevaiyaa bataaya
 While the BSP gave more respect to the Brahmins than the Dalits, the Samajwadi Party forgot the Yadavs and the Muslims for a while while making the Brahmins their total deity
 sapa ne vidhansabha chunaav se purv nirdosh aatanki musalamaanon par se mukadmaa uthaane kaa vaayada kiya tha jo abhi tak puraa nahin hua he
 SP state president and state chief minister Akhilesh Yadav also showed the Brahmins that the cases registered against them in Mayawati's time would be taken up
 unhone brahman sammelan ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, ‘pichhali sarkaar main aap logon par farji mukademe lagaae gaye the, aapako jail bhi janaa padaa tha
 i assure you that the fake cases against you will be withdrawn
 ’akhilesh ne yah bhi yaad dilaayaa ki kai maamle pehle hi waapas liye ja chuke hai
 Saying that the Brahmin society has always carried all sections of the society together and is socialist in the true sense, he said that the SP government will not spare any core in protecting the honor and respect of the Brahmin society and will always stand with them
 Will give
 akhilesh yadav ne brahmanon ko lubhaate hue kaha ki jidhar brahman jayega, udhar hi sarkaar banegi
 Wherever you blow the wind, there will be power
 unhone yaad dilaayaa ki basapa ke shasankaal main brahmanon ko apmaan ke ghunt pine pade the
 He assured that during sp's reign, not only will his honor be protected, but the government will also fight for his rights
 duusari taraf, maharajaganj main basapa ne satish mishra ke netritv main brahman sammelan karke bataaya ki basapa ke shasankaal main har mahatvapurn pad brahmanon ko hi die gaye the
 He expressed surprise that recently in Etawah, the party which insulted the Brahmins so much that they had to leave the village, the same party is claiming to be friendly to the Brahmins and seeking votes from them
 unhone sapa ke saath congress or bijepi par bhi brahman virdohi hone ke aarope lagaate hue bataaya ki basapa ne hi sabase adhik tikat brahmanon ko die hai
 Satish Chandra Mishra said that the BSP is going to hold a Brahmin conference at 38 places to tell who is their real sympathizer among the Brahmins
 basapa ne santakabeernagar ke baad maharajaganj main ravivaar ko doosraa sammelan kiya he
 SP has also held a Brahmin conference on 26 April in the name of Enlightened Conference

 Jitendra had said that this section should be debated
 is par jammu kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla bole ki yaa to dhara 370 rahegi yaa jammu kashmir bharat kaa hissaa hi nahin rahegaa
 Aaj Tak spoke to Abdullah, so he said, RSS is not Maibap
 jaane or kya kaha abdulla ne
 Do you think that the new government should have started with the discussion on Article 370? Now or sometime, it will be unfortunate if the Government talks on Article 370
 main samaj saktaa hum ki bijepi is vivaad ko bhadakaana chaahegi
 But this is an election issue
 sachai to ye he ki jammu kashmir ke bharat se sanvaidhanik rishte ko khatm karne kii naubat laae bina dhara 370 ko nahin hataaya ja saktaa
 It is a matter of regret that the Minister does not understand this fact
 kya takneekee taur par is dhara ko hataaya janaa katai mumkin nahin?dhara 370 par desh kii samvidhan sabha vichaar kar sakati thi
 It was this institution that defined Jammu and Kashmir's relationship with India
 agar aap dobaaraa aisi kisi sabha ko aahut karte hai to desh main rajyon ke vilay kii bahes nae sire se shuru ho jaaegi
 If BJP wants to do this, then do it
 to kya is samvidhan sabha main pakistan ke kabje vaale kashmir ke pratinidhi bhi honge?bijepi or desh kii satta hameshaa yah daawa karti he ki pakistan ke niyantran vaala kashmir bharat kaa hissaa he
 In such a situation, it is bound to be a member of the Constituent Assembly
 par ye samvidhan sabha bulaane koun ja rahaa he
 Will this start a fresh debate on the demand for independence of Jammu and Kashmir? i do not know whether the plebiscite or the demand for independence will rise now
 par main itnaa to yakini taur par jaanata hum ki soobe main anischitata kaa maahaul panpane lagegaa
 This is not the statement of any leader
 yah pradhanmantri karyaalay se bataur mantri jude shaks kaa bayaan he
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has said that Jammu and Kashmir is not a personal property of Omar Abdullah? i have never said that it is my property
 magar main jammu kashmir kaa ek naagarik hum or mujhe apane haq ke bare main aawaaj buland karne kaa puraa haq he
 My commitment is not to RSS
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh meraa mibap nahin he
 No rsswala can stop me from talking about my state
 kya aap is baat se niraash hai ki bharat or pakistan ke pradhanmantriyon kii dilli main hui mulaakaat ke dauraan kashmir kaa zikr bhi nahin hua?main to is mulaakaat se khush hum or na hi niraash
 i agree that Kashmir cannot be ignored
 pakistan ke purv captain wasim akram ne pakistan cricket board (pisibi) or rashtriya team prabandhan ko salaah di he ki bharat ke daure ke dauraan khilaadiyon se schuli bacchon jaisaa vyavhaar nahin karnaa chahie
 Reacting to the remarks made by Pakistan team manager Naved Cheema, Akram said that if he is made to feel that he is in jail in India, it will affect his performance
 cheema ne kaha tha ki khilaadiyon ko bharat main swatantra hokar ghoomane or nijee partiyon yaa kaaryakramon main jane kii anumati nahin di jaayegi
 Akram said, 'I do not agree with this
 mujhe lagata he ki khilaadiyon ko swatantraaa deni chahie, agar ve relax rahenge to ve acha pradarshan karenge
 He said, "I know that things have changed in international cricket due to the spot-fixing episode and the media, but still players should be given responsibility
" ’unhone kaha ki pisibi ko khilaadiyon ko or jimmedaari deni chahie
 Akram said, 'pakistani players are popular in India and it is a good experience to visit India
 main kai baar rashtriya team ke saath vahaan ja chukaa hum
 i would say don't make it a jail for players
 ’unhone bharat ke england main test shrinkhalaa ganvaane ke baad is baat ko bhi khaarij kiya ki pakistan aagaamee tii20 or vanade shrinkhalaa main prabal daavedaar he
 Akram said, "playing Test is a bit different and Indian team will be a different team in limited overs matches
 ’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation on Saturday evening after the verdict on Ayodhya

 In the 2002 hit and run case, Salman Khan's driver took the whole charge and turned the entire case
 haalanki is maamle main sarkari vakil kaa kahana he ki salmaan khan kaa driver ashok singh jhooth bol rahaa he
 During the hearing of the case, Special Public Prosecutor Pradeep Gharat says, "if he had been driving that night, he would have been mentioned in the statements of the witnesses, but in 12 years neither his name nor he ever appeared himself
 
 ab achaanak adaalat main aakar bataanaa ki 27 sitambar 2002 kii raat landcruzar vah chalaa rahaa tha, naa ki salmaan khan
 This is a lie
 salmaan hit and ran mukademe kii antim jirah main pradeep gharat ne ashok singh ko jhootha sabit karne ke liye kai vajahen ginaayin
 He also cited Salman's statement with police constable Ravindra Patil that day in which he did not mention Ashok Singh anywhere
 ulte patil nen apane bayaan main bataaya tha ki us raat usne tej gati se gaadi chalaane par salmaan ko naseehat di thi ki tej gati se gaadi naa chalaaen
 Significantly, Ravindra Patil has died, but the court has accepted his statement as evidence
 pradeep gharat ne adaalat ke saamne yah sawaal bhi uthaaya ki aaropee salmaan khan 12 saal se adaalat ke chakkar laga rahe hai
 He also has to go to jail
 to sawaal he kya koi maalik apane driver ke liye itnaa bada tyaag kar saktaa he? Gharat claimed that if it is proved that Ashok Singh is a liar, he will complain against him for giving false medicine
 sarkari vakil ne salmaan ke is daawey ko bhi galat bataaya ki rain baar main vah sharaab nahin pani pi rahe the
 According to Gharat, the bar waiter had stated in his statement that he had served Bacardi rum, cocktails, prawns and chicken on Salman's table
 us dor usne bataaya tha ki salmaan ke shishe ke glass main jo taral padaarth tha vah rangahin tha or bacardi ram pani jaisaa dikhataa he
 During that time, the defense did not even bring in the cross examination that Salman was drinking water
 sarkari vakil adaalat main jab daleel pesh kar rahe the, tab abhinayta salmaan khan khud maujuud the
 Finally, his lawyer pleaded for Salman to be exempted from appearing in court on Tuesday, but on the opposition of the government lawyer, the court refused to give Salman a waiver and also asked him to appear on Tuesday
 sarkari vakil mangalvaar 7 april ko bhi apni jirah jari rakhegein
 In the accident in 2002, Salman's car hit the workers sleeping on the sidewalk in front of the American Bakery in Bandra, one of whom was killed and four people were injured
 jammu kashmir sarkaar ne bade paimaane par adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa karte hue 10 upayuktaon sahit 34 prashasnic adhikariyon tathaa 56 police adhikariyon kaa sthanantaran kar diya
 a government spokesperson said the transfers were approved in a meeting of the Council of Ministers headed by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah
 unhone kaha ki kupwada, anantnag, leh, kargil, bandipura, shopiyaan, doda, gandarbal, kulgaam or rajouri ke upayuktaon ke tabadale kar diye gayi hai
 Nowadays, the biggest enemy of the truth is not untrue, but the truth is itself, because she does not take offense, carries gentleness with her
 aajkal ke jamaane main vah he out-of-date
 This is the much hyped statement of Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh
 dashakon pehle likhe gaye unke sahitya kii tarah hi unki kahi gai baaten bhi utana hi maujuun hai
 Muktibodh has been a very special creator of Hindi
 kavita, kahani or aalochana main unhone yug badal dene vaala kaam kiya
 For the first time as a poet he systematically appeared with his poems in 'tar Saptak' edited by Sachchidananda Hiranand Vatsyayan 'agyeya'
 yah behad durbhagyapurna tha ki unke jeevankaal main unki kavita kii koi kitaab nahin prakashit ho pai
 She had only one book to live on, that was' a literary diary
 'par unki rachanaaon kii dhamak kaa alam yah tha ki hindi sahitya lekar padhane vaala koi bhi chaatr bina muktibodh ko padhe na to snatakottar ho sktaa he, na hi prashasnic adhikari
 Muktibodh and his long poems are a permanent subject in the Central Administrative Examinations
 vah aise vilakshan rachanaakaar hai, jinke likhe kii gunj parvarti kavita, vichaar, aalochana, kahani sabamein badhati hi rahi he
 
 alam yah tha ki saal 2008 main bhartiya gyanpith ne jab unki ek kriti 'vipaatr' chhaapi to uske parichay main likhaa- laghu upanyaas, yaa ek lambi kahani, yaa diary kaa ansh, yaa lambaa ramya gadhy, yaa chaunkaane vaala ek vishesh prayog- kuch bhi sangya is pustak ko di ja sakati he, par in sabase vishesh he yah katha-kriti, jiskaa prayek ansh apane aap main paripurna or itnaa jivant he ki padhanaa armbh karen to puri padhane kaa man ho, or kahin bhi choden to lage ki ek purna rachana padhane kaa sukh mila
 Gajanan Madhav 'muktibodh' was born on 13 November 1917 in Sheopur, Gwalior
 unki aarmabhik shiksha ujjain main hui
 The father was an Inspector of the Police Department and he was transferred frequently, so Muktibodh's education was hampered after he completed his BA in 1938 from Holkar of Indore and became a teacher at the Modern School in Ujjain
 saal 1940 main muktibodh shujalpur ke sharada shiksha sadan main adhyaaapak ho gaye
 After this, Ujjain, Calcutta, Indore, Bombay, Bangalore, Banaras and Jabalpur etc
 got jobs
 saal 1942 ke bharat chodo andolan ke dauraan jab yah sharada shiksha sadan band ho gaya, to muktibodh phir se ujjain chale gayi
 Worked there from mastery to air force, journalism and political parties
 saal 1948 main vah nagpur aaye
 Worked in Information and Publications Department, All India Radio and 'naya Khoon'
 ant main kuch maah tak paathya pustaken bhi likhi
 In 1958, he became a professor in Digvijay College, Rajnandgaon
 unhone khud likhaa ki-naukariyaan pakadta or chodta rahaa
 Teacher, journalist, re-teacher, government and non-government jobs
 nimna-madhyavargeey jivan, bal-bachche, dawaadaaru, janm-maut main ulajhaa rahaa
 Despite the freedom of his journey, Muktibod was printed right after death
 unki charchit kritiyon main kavita sangrah- chaand kaa munh tedha he, bhuri bhuri khaak dhul; kahani sangrah- kaath kaa sapana, vipaatr, sataha se uthta aadmi; aalochana- kamayani: ek punarvichaar, nai kavita kaa aatmsangharsh, nae sahitya kaa saundaryashastra, samiksha kii samasyaayen, ek saahitiyik kii diary;itihaas- bharat: itihaas or samskruti tathaa muktibodh rachanawali shaamil he
 Yet Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh is basically a poet
 unki kavitaayen jatil hai, duruh hai, par apane bhav main vishisht
 a tone of new poetry that is difficult to ignore
 beesvin sadi kii hindi kavita kaa sabase baichaiyn, sabase tadapata or sabase eemaandaar swar hai gajanan madhav muktibodh
 Bhagwan Singh describes the complexity of his poem as follows- 'they are not succulent, not pleasant
 ve hamen jhakzor detii hai, gudgudati nahin
 They not only demand for eclipse, they also demand conduct
 tarasptak main muktibodh ne swayan kaha he, ‘meri kavitaayen apana path khojate baichaiyn man kii abhivyakti hai
 Their truth and value are hidden in the same living condition
 prakhyat aalochak namvar singh ne kaha he- nai kavita main muktibodh kii jagah vahi he, jo chhayavaad main niraala kii thi
 Like Nirala, Muktibodh challenged the limits of the general poetry of his era as well as challenged his limits to reflect the creative distinctiveness that led to the correct evaluation of contemporary poetry

 Drink the dark truths of the night, it is enough to kill human beings
 These tricks are there! There is curfew in the sky, there is a strong poison in the time !! There is a mist in the dim light hanging on the electric pillars in the bull, there is a worry about the betting heart -winashini !! The blackened night's night spread over the miscreants, the sugar syrup of the truth !! the crooked light of the crooked-moon moon

 Amethi's new MP Smriti Irani, who defeated Congress President Rahul Gandhi in her family's stronghold in the biggest reversal of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, is discussed everywhere

 In an exclusive interview with India Today Group, a day after his victory over Amethi, Irani said that his opponent had conceded defeat to Amethi on the same day that he chose Wayanad as the second seat to contest in Kerala

 The seat from where Rahul's mother Sonia Gandhi, father Rajiv Gandhi and uncle Sanjay Gandhi have also once represented in the Lok Sabha
 2004 se khud rahul gandhi amethi loksabhaa seat se saansad chune aa rahe the
 Irani told India Today and Aaj Tak news director Rahul Kanwal, 'in 2014 i told you that the next Amethi MP will be from BJP
 jo sach sabit hua
 Irani also said, 'you tweeted a few days ago on the plight of Amethi because of a missing MP
 main aapako bharosa detii hum ki aap paanch saal baad yahaan aaenge to aapke paas abhivyakt karne ke liye kuch acha hoga
 Mandate for Development: The newly elected MP from Amethi of BJP considered his victory as a mandate for development
 irani ne kaha, 'amethi ke log bhi vikaas chaahate hai
 They do not want to vote for anyone so that they can take five years of rest
 balki wo ummid rakhte hai ki jise vot den wo unke liye sangharsh or seva kare
 Irani credited his victory to the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi

 irani ne haalanki itnaa kaha ki rahul gandhi kaa kerala main vynad se bhi chunaav ladane kaa faisla, unka kabool karnaa tha ki ve amethi haar rahe hai
 Irani said, 'the president of a national party chooses another seat for itself when the name of its candidate (from Amethi) is announced by the BJP
 us party ke rashtriya adhyaksh ko unki puri sthaneey ikai hi likh kar detii he ki sahab apane liye duusari seat dhund lijie

 'irani ne amethi ke buniyadi suvidhaon se pichde hone ke liye rahul gandhi ko hi kathghare main khadaa kiya

 Irani also referred to the sentiment of Pradeep Gupta, CMD of axis-my-india, when the election results came in line with the exit poll estimates
 irani ne kaha, 'exis team ke pratinidhi ko maine aapke channel par bhavuk hote hue notice kiya
 This shows that an ordinary person connected to the ground could see the Modi wave
 us par jo sawaal kiye gaye
 The way he was tortured
 aise main jo janadesh aayaa main samajhati hum ki wo unki jeet he
 'raj Narayan's stature is very high
 Smriti Irani refused to compare her victory in Amethi to that of freedom fighter and politician Raj Narayan, who defeated Indira Gandhi in the 1977 Lok Sabha election
 irani ne kaha, 'unka kad bahut bada tha
 i am an ordinary party worker
 naa mere paas un jaisaa kad he or naa hi anubhav
 Comparison with them is unmatched

 raajnneeti main vakt ek jaisaa nahin rahata
 Kumar Vishwas, who hit the Aam Aadmi Party ticket in Amethi against Rahul Gandhi in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, is now saying that Rahul has matured politically with time
 rahul kii ore se congress adhyaksh pad ke liye somvaar ko namakan bhare jane par vishwaas ne unhen shubhakamanaayen deen
 Vishwas said that Kirahul Gandhi who is campaigning in Gujarat with sincerity, seeing that with the passage of time, political maturity has come inside Rahul Gandhi
 bataa den ki vishwaas ne amethi main chunaav ladate vakt vanshavaad raajnneeti ko lekar rahul par jamkar tanj kase the
 It is a matter of time that circumstances have changed for Kumar Vishwas himself in the Aam Aadmi Party
 vishwaas ne ravivaar ko hi ‘AAP 2
 It is said to bring 0 '
 rahul ke khilaaf ateet main kii gai bayaanbaji ke sambandh main sawaal puche jane par vishwaas ne kaha, ‘hamaare liye koi bhi dal yaa netaa raajnneetik vidwesh kaa paatr nahin he
 But we expect Rahul Gandhi that if he wants to be the leader of the largest party in the country, he will come on the road and fight
 vishwaas ne kaha ki amethi main chunaav ladane ke vakt beshak unhe vot kam mili lekin badi baat thi kiraahul gandhi, unki maa or bahan ko bhi amethi main prachaar ke liye utarana padaa
 Responding to the aggressive way of campaigning for Rahul Gandhi in the Gujarat elections, Vishwas said, 'today Rahul Gandhi is going everywhere, rallying and trying to communicate
 saath hi jab bijepi se jumale aate hai to idhar se bhi jumale die ja rahe hai yani rahul gandhi seekhney kii koshish kar rahe hai, isliye unhen meri shubhakamanaayen
 'will Congress benefit from Rahul Gandhi's campaign in Gujarat elections? Faith of this question was answered, 'even if the Congress government is not formed in the Gujarat elections, but today a leader who is leading the Congress in front is getting ready which is a good sign for any political party
 ’haalankivishwaas nerahul kii tajposhi par shahzad poonawala kii ore se uthaae gaye sawaal par chutki bhi lee
 Vishwas said, 'everyone knows that if Congress wants to fulfill its constitutional procedures and elect its new president, the result of which is already known, then there is nothing wrong in that
 ’rahul gandhi or congress ke liye 4 disambar kii taarikh bahut ahm he
 In such a situation, it is not a big deal that even his opponents are taking notice of his political maturity by wishing him good luck
 daati maharaj ke khilaaf balaatkaar maamle kii jaanch kar rahi kendriya jaanch beuro (CBI) ko dilli kii saket adaalat ne kadi fatkaar lagaai he
 The court has reprimanded the CBI for adopting a poor attitude in the investigation of the Dati Maharaj case so far
 aapako bataa den ki daati maharaj par unke hi ashram kii ek mahila se balaatkaar jaise gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 More than a year has passed since the FIR was registered in this case, but Dati Maharaj has not yet been arrested
 dilli kii saket court ne poocha ki hoicourt ke aadesh ke baavjood 3 maheene ke bheetar sibiai ne apni jaanch puri karke court main states report kyon nahin di
 The CBI was also demanding time in this case from the court on Wednesday, but the court flatly denied it
 court is baat par bhi naaraaz tha ki pichley saal 3 oktober ko hoicourt ne sibiai jaanch ke aadesh die the, jisamen 3 maheene ke bheetar jaanch puri karne ko kaha gaya tha
 This period also ended on January 3, but so far no application has been filed by the CBI in court for the custodial interrogation of Dati Maharaj in the case
 isse pehle maamle main daati maharaj pehali baar saket court ke saamne pesh hue or court ne ek lakh rupee ke muchalke par daati maharaj ko jamaanat de di
 Saket Court of Delhi has granted bail to Dati as well as her three brothers
 is maamle main dilli police pehle hi apni chargeshit saket court main daakhil kar chuki he
 Cognition has also been taken on behalf of Saket Court on the charge sheet
 daati maharaj ko court main pesh hone ke liye saman kiya gaya tha
 One of the major reasons for the bail granted to Dati Maharaj by the court is that the investigating agency, whether it has been the Delhi Police or someone has not been able to present concrete evidence against Dati Maharaj in front of the court by conducting a thorough investigation
 is maamle main peedita ne dilli hoicourt main yachika daakhil kar kaha tha ki dilli police maamle ko kamjor karne kii koshish kar rahi he or daati maharaj ko bachaaya ja rahaa he, jiske baad sibiai ko maamle kii jaanch saunp di gai thi
 The Saket court will next hear the case on 8 February
 mana ja rahaa he ki court kii is fatkaar ke baad ab sibiai is maamle main gambhirtha dikhaaegi or jald se jald chargeshit daakhil karegi
 The noise of the CBI dispute is heard in Delhi even as West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's 'save the Constitution' strike in Kolkata

 iske baad loksabhaa main grahamantri rajnath singh ne silsilewar tareeke se ravivaar raat kolkata main hue ghatnakram kaa byora diya
 Responding to the allegations by opposition mps, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that CBI officials were not only prevented from doing legal work in Kolkata on Sunday night but were taken to the police station which is unprecedented in the history of India
 unhone kaha ki desh main ajtak aisi ghatana nahin hui he
 Referring to the Saradha chit fund scam, he said that in this scam, lakhs of poor people have been defrauded and action is being taken in this matter as per the directions of the Supreme Court
 jaanch main police ne nahin kiya sahyograjanath singh ne kaha ki supreme court ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki ab tak kii jaanch main kuch prabhaavshaalee netaaon ke is ghotaale main shaamil hone kaa shaq he
 He also said that the Kolkata Police Commissioner was not cooperating in the investigation, so CBI officers had to take forced action
 kolkata main sibiai team kii suraksha ke liye centre ko siarpief ko tainaat karne kaa aadesh dena padaa
 The Home Minister said that such a confrontation between law enforcement agencies is unfortunate
 unhone kaha ki kal jo bhi ghatnaayen ghatin, vah sanvaidhanik vyavasthaaon ke tuutane kii ore ishaara karti hai
 He said that the Governor of West Bengal has been requested to give a report in this entire matter
 rajnath ne kaha ki sabhi rajya sarkaron se or pashchim bengal sarkaar se vah ummid karte hai ki kanoon pravartan agenciyon ko jaanch ke liye anukool maahaul muhaiyaa karaayaa jayega
 During the Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha, TMC MP Saugata Roy said that 40 CBI officials arriving at the Kolkata Police Commissioner's residence on Sunday evening was an attack on the Constitution
 unhone kaha ki pichley dinon kolkata main vipakshi dalon kii raily ke baad se modi sarkaar vipaksh ke netaaon ko daraane, dhamkaane ke liye sibiai kaa durupyog kar rahi he
 After Rajnath Singh's statement in the House, there was a huge uproar and opposition leaders started shouting slogans against the CBI and the Modi government
