 The ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal has accused the Vishwa Hindu Parishad of converting more than 100 Christians
 rajya main mantri or trinmul congress ke vidhayak ashish banerjee ne daawa kiya ki buudhvaar ko viechpi ne birbhum jile ke rampurhaat sthit khurmaadaana gaanv main dharmantaran samaaroh kiya or isamen 100 se zyada isaayiyon kaa dharmantaran karaayaa
 Minister of State for Education Banerjee said, 'the conversion ceremony was organized in Khurmadana village
 hamane jila prashasan se report maangi he or hamaare varisht netaa is maamle main kadi karrwai karne par charchaa kar rahe hai
 In the Rajya Sabha, Trinamool Chief Whip Derek o'brien reacted strongly saying that the state government is busy examining the details and "if there is any indication of forced conversion, then we will deal with as much rigor as possible
" 'o bryan ne twit kiya, 'bengal kaa sampradayik sauhaard ke saath rahane kaa lanbaa itihaas rahaa he or (praveen) togadiya jaise dharmaandh se kathorta se nipta jayega
 We have to say that if there is any indication of forced conversion then the issue will be dealt with as rigorously as possible
 'aarope se inkaar karte hue viechpi ke sanghathan sachiv sachindranath sinha ne kaha ki yah ek dharmik samaaroh tha, na ki 'ghar vaapasi' tha
 Significantly, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad now uses the word 'homecoming' for conversion
 sinha ne kaha, 'dharmaataran karaane kaa aarope jhootha he
 It was not a 'homecoming' but a religious ceremony attended by most of the villagers, including some Christian families
 hamane sadaiv se hindu dharm main lautne kii ichha rakhane waalon kaa swaagat kiya he
 Many who attended the ceremony, however, claimed that they voluntarily embraced Hinduism
 ek mahila ne samachar channel se kaha, 'vahaan koi dabaav nahin tha
 i was a Christian and now have accepted Hinduism on my own wish

 Anushka Sharma looked very happy while telling about this
 Today , during our 8
 5 km uphill trek we stopped by a small village on a mountain to pet and feed a baby calf who was born just 4 months ago
 While we did that the owner of the house asked us if we were tired and wanted to have a cup of tea ? So we went in to the home of this beautiful and warm family who had absolutely no idea who we were and yet they treated us with such warmth and love 
 We spent some time with them chatting and drinking tea and the whole time they just know us as two tired trekkers! Whoever knows virat and me very closely, know that both of us live for such moments of genuine, simple and pure human connection
 It fills us with such joy and peace knowing that they just wanted to be kind to two random foreigners ( plus our guide ) without seeking anything in return
 If this is not the true meaning of life then i dont know what is
 a memory we will cherish forever a post shared by anushkasharma1588 (@anushkasharma) on Nov 4, 2019 at 8:44am pstvahim, work front kii baat karen to anoushka sharma (anushka Sharma) aakhri baar film 'jiro' main najar ai thim

 You also learned martial arts? Yes, Akshayar is a specialist, but i had no knowledge about it, so i took training for about 4 months
 If you don't seem to be a fighter in front of Akshay Kumar, then there was no point in doing such a film
 ab trailor ko dekh kar khushi milti he kii chalo thodaa behatar hua he
 Did you face some difficulties during fitness too? It was a very difficult task because one i had to gain weight and above that i was also going for 5-5 hours of training

 International trainers helped a lot

 isfilmaki khaasiyat kya he ?hamaari film main yah pehali baar hoga kii mard rone vaale hai
 There is such an emotional moment during the climax when I, Akshay sir and Jackie sir, cry all three

 Even Akshay Kumar said during dubbing that his eyes were filled too

 Because of them i am doing work and interviews

 There were reports that Katrina is angry with you? i myself am thirty, she is also thirty (laughs)
 abhi bhi ham log luk test kar rahe hai

 ) In Delhi, a city of nearly two million people, a man lay on a rocky road for 29 minutes and sobbed for two helping hands, sobbing
 is dauraan uske paas se 140 kaaren gujarin
 181 motorcycle riders passed
 82 auto gujarey
 45 passers-by turned out
 par madad kaa haath kisi ne nahin badhaayaa
 Finally, he succumbed painfully in front of stony people on the same stony road
 ab aap hi bataaen phir aisi maut par kya ronaa?gharon ke daravaaje or khidkiyaan mat kholo
 Anyway, in this city hardly anyone opens their doors or windows to help anyone
 par yahaan to bich sadak par ankhon ke saamne padaa tha wo
 The stony road was constantly turning red due to its leakage
 har gujarata lamhaa uski saanson kii door kaat rahaa tha
 But no one, nobody helped him
 or phir haar kar usne isi patharilii sadak par dam tod diya
 What progress have we made? gharon se nikal kar flats main pahunch gaye
 Saying goodbye to the mohallas, he came to the colony
 apano or padosiyon ko chhod apane ird-gird khud kii sosayadi khadi kar lee
 Stretched the walls of high-rise buildings around him
 or phir fakhr se kahana shuru kar diya ki ham shahar main rahete hai
 We live in Delhi
 par kya vaaki ham sab jinda hai? kya sachmuch ham sab ji rahe hai? yaa phir murdon kii bheed ke bich ham sab khud murda ban chuke hai?darasal baichaiyn kar dene vaali ye tasviren pashchimi dilli ke subhash nagar ilaake kii hai
 The date was 10 August and the time was exactly five to forty minutes in the morning
 roji-roti ke liye apni neenden qurbaan kar puri raat naukari karne ke baad wo paidal ghar jane ke liye niklaa tha
 And just after that, the story starts
 
 Which i wish
 
 It would have been just the story
 taaki insaaniyat sharmindagi se batch jaati
 Auto collided, in fact a man is going towards the front
 uski chaal bataa rahi he ki wo thakaa-haara he
 But still walking on the road
 abhi use camere kii jad main aae surf chah second hi hae the ki tabhi ek behad tej raftaar tampo aata he or use peeche se itani jor se takkar martha he ki wo hawa main uchhal kar sadak kii bain taraf ja girtaa he
 He had become almost insensible as soon as Neetha fell
 udhar takkar se ek pal ke liye tempo kaa bhi balance bigadataa he, lekin tab gaadi ko sambhaal kar driver use bich sadak par hi roak detaa he
 After this, the tempo driver comes down and turns around and moves towards the person he has just hit
 ek pal ko laga ki shaayad wo uski madad ke liye aage bad rahaa he
 But the next moment the misunderstanding goes away
 tampo driver uske kareeb jate-jate achaanak rukta he or phir use marataa chhodkar apni tampo ke us hisse ko dekhne lagata he, jis hisse se wo takaraayaa tha
 After this, he leisurely turns back, and goes into the tampons
 aisa lagata he maano kuch hua hi naa ho
 The man kept screaming lying on the road, there was a deep injury on his head
 jism ke kai or hisse bhi jakhmi the
 The blood was continuously leaking
 magar wo ab bhi usee patharilii sadak par jas kaa tas padaa tha
 Rain water was stored nearby on the roadside
 khun dhire-dhire us pani ko laal kar rahaa tha
 He did not have the courage and the courage to stand up himself, go to the hospital and even shout for help
 bas dard kii aanhon main uski aanhen dabi ja rahi thim
 But life was still left in the body
 saansen ab bhi chal rahi thim
 It was about half an hour to stop
 iske paas se is dauraan tamaam insaan gujarey, paidal, gadiyon, motor gadiyon main
 Someone caught sight
 kisi kii nahin
 Someone looked straight and someone looked at them
 kisi ne nazren pher leen to kisi ne nazren badal leen
 And then finally two people suddenly arrive
 haroonges taur par donon rukate bhi hai
 Surprising all of us, both of them even touch the injured man
 uski nabj bhi tatolte hai
 But alas it was late now
 saanse intjaar kar haar chuki thim
 Now the breath was not really alive

 When Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team achieved a spectacular victory in the Mecca Lords of cricket, it was felt that now the team will return only after winning this series against England
 is ummid or vishwaas ke saath jab ve tisare test main utre to laga ki kuch hokar rahegaa lekin niraashajanak gendbaaji or usase bhi zyada bekaar ballebaaji ne unhen paraajay kaa rasta dikhaa diya
 England beat him to dust in Southampton
 yah dhoni kii hi nahin puri team kii vifaltaa he or iske liye lagbhag sabhi khilaadi kahin na kahin jimmedaar hai
 We lagged behind England in every department
 hamane mahatvapurn samay par kaich chode, niraashajanak gendbaaji kii or usase bhi badhkar ghatiya ballebaaji kii
 Virat Kohli, the most promising player of the Indian team, disappointed the most
 yah pehle se mana ja rahaa tha ki england main viraat kii agni pariksha hogi or hui bhi jisamen ve puri tarah asafal hue
 There, he was dismissed after playing on the balls that went out of the wicket, he was also out on ordinary balls
 unka approach kahin se peshewar nahin tha
 He did not seem to have been able to get away from the hangover of his previous success so far
 yahi haal cheteshwar pujaara kaa rahaa jinhen dravid kaa vikalp mana jaataa he
 But Anderson's quick and swinging balls showed him helpless
 moin ali jaise saadhaaran spinner kii gend par jis tarah se ve out hue usase to laga ki ve spin gendon ko khilne main bilkul anaadi hai
 Opener Shikhar Dhawan's batting is nowhere near complete and his technique is flawed
 jis tarah se vah kaamchalaoo spinner jo root kii gend par out hue usase to chayankartaaon kaa vishwaas hill gaya hoga
 Murali Vijay is playing better of course but he does not see the energy that should increase with every Test match
 rohit sharma to bilkul anaadi kii tarah khel rahe hai or unase aage koi ummid nahin kii ja sakati he
 Ajinkya Rahane is the only Indian batsman to showcase his talent even though he could have played far better in the first innings
 mahendra singh dhoni bhi ballebaaji main niraash karte dikh rahe hai
 If they had survived the second innings, the match would have been prolonged
 dhoni ko apni ballebaaji main or mehnat kerani hogi tabhi aglaa test match ham jeet paaenge jo siries baraabar karne ke liye jaruri he
 The batsmen as well as the bowlers were completely disappointed
 koi bhi gendbaaj jalawaa nahin dikhaa sakaa
 Ishant Sharma's lack was clearly visible
 shami, bhubaneshwar kumaar or pankaj singh ne puri tarah niraash kiya
 His balls had neither speed nor swing
 jadeja ek kaamchalaoo kism ke gendbaaj se zyada kuch nahin the
 The eyes are now on Old Trafford where Indian spinners have been performing well
 lekin hamaari samasya he ki ab hamaare paas world class spinner bhi nahin hai
 r Ashwin is the spinner of Indian pitches overall
 agle test main ham unase hi ummid kar sakate hai ki vah kuch karen
 It is not unreasonable to mention here that the ordinary England spin-spinner Moin Ali delivered six of India's finest batsmen and sent the entire team on the path of defeat, so why could not our spinners be able to do so? Many such questions are arising from this Test match, whose answers should be found in the next Test
 lords main jeet ke baad agar ham siries nahin bachaa paae to yah behad niraashajanak hoga

 While spending more than three months as UP in-charge, Shah's full thrust is to bring local activists who have gone from BJP to other parties in the last 20 years
 prabharee banane ke baad se shah gorakhpur, faijabad, agra, meerut, kanpur or jhaansi main kaaryakartaaon se feedback lekar party kii kamajori kii vajahen talash chuke hai

 Top government sources have told NDTV that the responsibility in the case will be decided after a detailed investigation

 The base was attacked by a group of six militants early Saturday, and is believed to have arrived from Pakistan

 After this, on January 1, the security cordon of the Pathankot Air Force Base was easily dismantled despite an alert by a senior police officer's car hijacking by militants wearing army uniforms

 Analysts believe that a major weakness of this base could be its 24-km circumference, which is not easy to monitor everywhere on a 10-foot-high wall with barbed wire

 pakistani seemaa se lagbhag 25 kilometre kii duuri par bane airforce base par hue hamale main saat surakshakarmi shahid hue tathaa 20 log ghayal hue
 The government believes that the entry of six terrorists into India from across the border on the night between 31 December and 1 January is a huge security lapse

 baad main salwinder singh ne patrakaron ko bataaya ki unhen agava karne vaale logon ke paas eke-47 riflein thim
 Home Secretary Rajiv Maharishi said that the presence of the attackers in Pathankot became clear by Friday afternoon, when more than 12 hours had elapsed after Salvinder's car was kidnapped

 The car of SP Salvinder Singh was left by the terrorists about one and a half kilometers away from the base, and after entering the base, they reached the mess of the guards and started firing indiscriminately
 tippaniyan The government and intelligence agencies are most concerned about the fact that the terrorists managed to sneak into the Pathankot air force base even after the sp's car was hijacked, while security arrangements were extended from midnight on Friday

 Analysts and officials say the attackers may have come from factions, one of which had abducted the sp's car, and two other militants entered the base separately

 mahatma gandhi ke janm ke pehle se hi hamaare desh kaa astitv tha
 In such a way, how can he be called the Father of the Nation? It is definitely that Mahatma Gandhi fought for the independence of the country and from this point of view it would be appropriate to call him Rashtra Son

 toronto police ke anusaar golibari karne vaala shaks mar chukaa he

 ravivaar ko canada ke otawa hawaii adde pahunche AAP vidhayak kultar singh sandhwa or amarjit singh sandoa ko hiraasat main liya gaya, phir poochtacha ke baad waapas hindustan bhej diya gaya
 However, the reason behind this has not been ascertained
 jo log naitik maandand tay karte hai yaa shuchita kii baaten karte hai unase ummiden bhi bad jaati hai
 It seems that they will be full of good conduct and high views
 lekin vaastavik jindagi main jab kuch iske thik vipareet ghatata he to jor kii chot lagati he or phir badi tikhi pratikriya hoti he
 The matter is that of Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal who is hiding his face at this time
 unka dosha sirf itnaa hi nahin he ki unhone apni ek junior sahyogi jo unki beti kii bhi mitra he, ke saath kutsit vyavhaar kiya balki kuch samay pehle tak sari duniya ko naitikta or shuchita kaa paath padhaate rahe
 He exposed many corrupt people in public life and always proudly elevated himself
 lekin is ahankaar ne unhen sabase upar samajhane kii aadat daal di
 And then what he did was embarrassed by the entire press community
 haalat yah he ki vah police se chhipate phir rahe or unke bachaav main unke vakil tarah-tarah kii daleelein de rahe hai
 Tarun Tejpal first apologized for his mistake but later retracted at the behest of the lawyers and pointed fingers at the victim
 unhone yah nahin sochaa ki janata kii adaalat kanoon kii adaalaton kii tarah kaam nahin karatin or vahaan farji daleelon ko jagah nahin mil paati
 So he immediately fell very low in the eyes of the people
 ab kanoon kii adaalat main unhen chaahe kuch bhi sajaa mili, janata kii adaalat main ve dand ke paatr ho chuke hai or yah unhen jivan bhar satayega
 His companions and companions have all turned away from him
 or kal koi unke bare main bolne vaala bhi nahin hoga

 Their numbers are not getting favorable in the elections, that is why they are coming down to the bottom for polarization purposes

 Both the ruling and opposition coalitions had asked their booth-level officials to take people out of their homes to polling booths on polling day, but it did not seem to bring color

 After this the vote gained some momentum and by six in the evening 55
 90 fisadi voting hui
 Barring a few polling booths, most polling booths did not see queues of voters

 While over half a dozen states have filed revision petitions in the Supreme Court to overcome the Supreme Court's order not to open liquor shops up to 500 meters along the highway, the Rajasthan government has found a unique way to save liquor
 state haive ke un ilaakon ko dinotiphoi kar state haive se urban road bana diya he jahaan par sharaab kii dukaane hai
 Aaj Tak has a list of roads denotified to make urban road inside such highway of PWD department of state government
 jaipur se jodhpur kaa megahaive, jahaan par 30 meter se kam kii duuri parsharab kii dukanhe
 But this liquor shop was going to be closed under the directions of the Supreme Court, but now this liquor shop along the highway will not be closed
 rajasthan sarkaar ke peedbludi vibhaag ne jaipur ke chomu puliya se gram kalawad ke bich 20 kimi
 This highway has been declared Urban Road
 isi tarah se rajasthan ke darjanon jilon main sarkaar ne haive kii paribhaasha haive ke andar hi 2 se 30 kimi tak badal di he
 This means that now unopened liquor shops can open on this road
 supreme court ke neshnal or state haive ke 500 meter ke andar sharaab kii dukaane nahin kholane kaa aadesh rajasthan main haive kinare saikadon dukaanon par nahin lagu hoga
 You put, i get along yah kahawatabakaari vibhagaper sateek baith rahi he
 When the Supreme Court ordered the liquor shops to be 500 meters away from the highways, then the Excise Department corresponded with the Public Works Department and got the status of the highways in the urban area
 saarvajanik nirmaan vibhaag ne pradesh main 25 rajmargon kaa darja khatm kar shahari maarg ghoshit kar diya he
 It includes a 6-km stretch of State highway-28a in the city of Balotra
 is par ab darjan bhar sharaab dukaanon kaa sanchaalan ho sakegaa
 According to Devendra Singh, District Excise Officer of Barmer District, the Government has declared the status of urban highways by the Public Works Department by abolishing the status of 21 highways in the state
 isamen balotra shahar main rajya rajmarg-28e kaa 6 kilometre kaa hissaa shaamil he
 In which we can open liquor store
 magar rajasthan ke peedbludi mantri unuus khan kah rahe hai ki haive kinare sharaab kii dukaan nahin kholane ke supreme court ke aadesh kaa paalan hoga
 The PWD department has its own peculiar argument that these places are populated, so local elders can take care of these roads
 darasal rajasthan main sharaab se kamai sarkaar kaa bada jariya he
 The income from liquor sales of excise department in 2015-16 was 6,700 crores while the target for 2017-17 is 7,300 crores

 He stressed that the debt of farmers will be forgiven
 gandhi ne kaha ki aaj hindustan ke saamne do bade mudde hai
 One is the issue of the future of the farmer of India and the other is the employment of the youth

 5 lakh crore rupees loan also want to be forgiven
 naaron ke bich gandhi ne kaha ki hindustan kaa kisaan koi tohfa nahin maang rahaa he, sirf apana haq maang rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi alleged that the Prime Minister had promised to provide a reasonable price to the farmers, increase the MSP, but today the money of farmer insurance goes to Anil Ambani's pocket
 desh main district baant rakhe hai, kisaan ye bhi nahin chun saktaa he ki koun si company kaa beemaa len
 He accused the government of dividing Hindustan between Ambani and Adani
 rahul gandhi ne tanzia lahaze main kaha ki hindustan kaa kisaan modi ji se anil ambani kaa hawaii jahaaj nahin maang rahaa he, magar hindustan kaa kisaan ye kah rahaa he ki agar aap anil ambani ko 30,000 karod rupye hindustan kii airforce kaa paisa de sakate hai, agar aap apane 15 mitron ko 3 lakh 50 hajaar karod rupye de sakate hai, to hamaari mehnat ke liye, hamaare khun ke liye, hamaare paseene ke liye aapako hamaara karja maaf karke dena hi padegaa
 Rahul Gandhi said in his address that no one person runs this country, no one runs a party, farmers, laborers, small shopkeepers, youth, mothers, sisters run this country together
 baad main rahul gandhi ne twit kiyah kisaan desh par bhaar nahin hai
 Farmers are the essence of the country
 desh kaa kisaan sankat main he
 Their hopes are falling apart
 unke dil main dard he
 We cannot leave the farmer alone
 chaahe kanoon badalanaa pade, sarkaar badalani pade yaa pradhanmantri badalanaa pade, ham kisaan kaa saath denge
 There will be justice with the farmer
 gauratlab he ki vidhansabha chunaavon ke is daur main jahaan rajasthan main voting honi baaki he, or jahaan kisaan apni fasal bechney main mushkilon kaa saamana kar rahe hai, vahiin kisaanon kii yah raily siyaasi asar chhod sakati he

 hina ne yah bhi kaha ki bhartiya netaaon ko unke desh ke ghatnakramon se sikh leni chahie
 He said, We are not surprised to hear the comments of many leaders of India
 meraa maananaa he ki yah vah cheez he jo pakistan main badal gai he or bharat ko isse sikh leni chahie
 Hina said, i reached twenty years ago after the remarks of the Chief of Army Staff
 unase poocha gaya, unhone kya kaha? hina ne kaha, puri tarah se aakraamak tippanee
 General Singh gave a clear warning to Pakistan, saying that India has the right to retaliate at the 'time and place' of its choice
 unhone gat 8 janvari ko jammu-kashmir ke mendhar kshetra main hui ghatana par sakht tippanee karte hue kaha ki javaanon kaa sir kaatna ‘asweekaar’ or ‘atyant akshamya’ he or yadi uksaaya gaya to sainik tatkaal, aakraamak rup se pratikriya karenge
 The comments hina sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke ek vishesh satr main shaamil hone ke liye neuyork main hai, jiskaa pakistan janvari maheene ke liye adhyaksh he
 Hina said, i believe that Pakistan today represents a country which is clear about how it has to live with its neighbors
 ham jis tareeke se apane padosiyon ke saath rahanaa chaahate hai vah yah he ki prayaas karke ek aise vaataavaran kaa nirmaan kiya jaae, jisamen ham apane vivaadon kaa sainya bayanon yaa sainya karravaayiyon kii bajaay vaarta ke jariye hal kar saken
 Answering a question on Kashmir, Hina said that she believes that the last two weeks have been troublesome
 unhone kaha, do sainik the, jo sangharsh main us sthaan par ghayal ho gaye the, jo pakistani kshetra main 400 meter bheetar tha
 One of them succumbed to the wounded soldier
 hamane chintaa jataate hue apni chintaa bhartiya paksh se jataayi or lagu saamaanya vyavastha kii maang kii
 "two or three days after that incident, we were accused that both Indian soldiers were killed by Pakistani soldiers," he said
 hamane isaki jaanch kii or hamen is baat ke koi saboot nahin mili ki pakistani sainikon ne yah kiya tha
 Then came the very conflicting statements that he was beheaded
 unhone kaha, uttari commander pravaktaa ne kaha ki aisa nahin hua jabaki anya kehete hai ki aisa hua
 So after all this, unfortunately domestic politics started
 unhone kaha, hamen bharat ke kai netaaon kii tippaniyan sunakar koi sukhad hairaani nahin hui he
 i believe this is something that has changed in Pakistan and India should learn from it
 hina ne kaha, senadhyaksh kii tippanee ke baad main bees varsh pehle pahunch gai
 He was asked, what did he say? Hina said, a completely offensive comment
 general singh ne yah kehete hue pakistan ko spasht chetavanee di ki bharat ke paas apni pasand ke ‘samay or sthaan’ par javaabi karrwai kaa adhikaar he
 He made a strong comment on the incident on 8 January in Mendhar area of jammu and Kashmir, saying that beheading of the soldiers was 'unacceptable' and 'extremely unforgivable' and that the soldiers would react immediately, aggressively if provoked
 tippaniyan Hina is in New York to attend a special session of the United Nations Security Council, which Pakistan presides over for the month of January
 hina ne kaha, meraa maananaa he ki pakistan aaj ek aise desh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jo is baat ko lekar spasht he ki use apane padosiyon ke saath kaise rahanaa he
 The way we want to be with our neighbors is to try and create an environment in which we can resolve our disputes through dialogue rather than military statements or military actions
 kashmir par ek prashn kaa uttar dete hue hina ne kaha ki unka maananaa he ki gat do saptaah pareshaan karne vaale rahe hai
 He said, there were two soldiers, who were injured in the conflict at the place which was within 400 meters of the Pakistani territory
 unamem se ek ghayal sainik ne dam tod diya
 While expressing concern, we expressed our concern from the Indian side and demanded a general system in force
 unhone kaha, us ghatana ke do yaa teen din baad ham par yah aarope lagaaya gaya ki donon bhartiya sainik pakistani sainikon dwaara maare gaye
 We investigated this and we could not find any evidence that Pakistani soldiers had done this
 uske baad atyant paraspar virdohi bayaan aae ki unke sir kaate gaye
 He said, the Northern Commander spokesman said that it did not happen while others say it did
 isliye is sabake ke baad durbhaagya se gharelu raajnneeti shuru ho gai

 bharat main cricket 1980 ke dashak ke baad kaaphi mashhoor ho gaya
 When India won the World Cup for the first time, the West Indies were considered to be the most dangerous team in the world, defeating the West Indies was not a matter of any team
 
 
 
 Cricket is said to have originated in England, but has been raised in India
 bharat main cricket kis kadar mashhoor he uskaa andaja aap is baat se laga sakate hai ki sadak chalata ek rikhshavala bhi aapako Down the Ground, in the stand yaa Between the Wicket kaa matlab bataa saktaa he
 Similarly, in the World Cup matches or the exciting match between India and Pakistan, one can also tell about the Test match a day before, how much India's score was and which player scored or how many T- Which teams are competing in 20 today
 
 
 bestsaling lekhak or patrkaar rajdeep saradesai ne usee cricket ke gyaarah khilaadiyon par 'team loktantr bhartiya cricket kii shandaar kahani' likhi he
 Rajdeep is an English celebrity journalist and writes in the same language
 unhone yah kitaab angreji main Democracy's XI: The Great Indian Cricket Story naam se likhi, hindi main jiskaa anuwaad kethan mishra ne kiya he
 This book contains stories of that upbringing of cricket
 
 
 jise kisi ballebaaj ne apane cover drive se to kisi gendbaaj ne apni phirakin se paala posa
 
 
 The role of the book is written in such a way that once you start reading the book, you will not be able to live without reading it
 
 
 
 While the book has small stories of cricketers from big cities like Goa, Mumbai and Delhi, there is also the story of an ordinary boy from a small town like Ranchi who becomes the richest player due to cricket
 
 
 
 Cricket has also been introduced as a better example in the book to explain a better democracy
 
 
 jaisaa ki naam se hi spasht he 'team loktantr' yani ki loktantr ke safalataa kii wo kahaniyaan jo sansad bhawan main nahin 22 gaj kii pich par zyada mashhoor hui
 
 
 Some stories will make you tickle, but there are some stories that you will be proud to read
 
 
 
 If you love cricket or you play cricket, while reading the book, you will be able to connect yourself with some stories
 
 
 kitaab main loktantr, sangharsh, parivaarwaad, junun, bharosa, vishwaas, kshamta ityadi ko bhi darshaya gaya he
 
 
 This book tells that cricket is the one who can unite this country in the best way
 bhartiya cricket team chote-bade shaharon se aaye hue logon kaa ek shandaar mishran he jahaan kitne hi alag-alag dharm, varg, jati, ilaakon or bhashaaon ke khilaadi saath khelte hai
 This is the group in which the son of a Ranchi pump manager can dare to dream big, where a Mumbai boy born with talent can play with a Muslim from the narrow streets of Hyderabad
 us vaqt jab parivaarwaad ne bollywood or raajnneeti ko jakad ke rakhaa he, cricket hi wo field he jahaan sab kuch samtal zamin par khelaa ja rahaa he or jo hamaare samvidhan ke usulon ko sahi myanon main saakaar kar rahaa he
 This game actually brings out the most accurate image of India
 apni is kitaab main bestsaling lekhak or patrkaar rajdeep saradesai yah bataane main safal rahe hai ki cricket hamen ek baat sikhaata he agar aapmen madda he, kshamta he, to aap bhi 133 karod jansankhwa vaale is desh ke un 11 khilaadiyon main se ek ho sakate hai jo 22 gaj kii pich par puure desh kaa netritv karata he
 
 
 You can also be a part of the team of 11 players, for which neither religion, caste, nor wealth, nor poverty, area and status do not matter to them
 
 
 
 What matters is only his cricket that leads him to that peak
 
 
 
 
 varisht patrkaar rajdeep saradesai 11 bhartiya cricket khilaadiyon ke madhyam se swadhinata ke baad ke bhartiya cricket kii kahani lekar pathak ke saamne aate hai
 These players include from the 60s Dilip Sardesai to Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virat Kohli
 vah bataate hai ki yah kitaab 11 sabase achche bhartiya cricketrs ke bare main nahin he, balki yah kitaab vyaktigat hawaalon se aaye hue kisson or kahaniyon ke dam par bhartiya cricket kii yatra ke bare main baat karti he
 The book begins with a rapturous days of excitement over the struggle of Indian cricket, when cricketers traveled on a train, got a few hundred rupees for a test match, and then stops there when a businessman worth crores of rupees in cricket The IPL has arrived
 khilaadi tak karodpati, arbapati ho chuke hai
 In this way, Sardesai has tried to keep an eye on the development of Indian society in addition to cricket
 'team loktantr' kii sabase acchhee baat ye he ki aap padhenge to sirf 11 khilaadiyon kii kahaniyaan, lekin un 11 khilaadiyon ke saath-saath aap unke samakaleen sabhi test cricketron ke bare main koi na koi ek kahani jarur pard lenge
 When there is democracy in the name itself, then of course there will be talk of politics
 is kitaab main kai baton ko ek khabar ke andaaj main bhi darshaya gaya he
 Like how a cricket control board is operated, or how many people work hard to make a player
 'team loktantr bhartiya cricket kii shandaar kahani' pustak main lalit modi dwaara ipel shuru karne kii kavayad, or desh main ipel ke chaa jane kii katha jahaan aapako cricket main bazaar ke badhate prabhaav se aapako rubaru karaayegi, vahiin yuvaraj singh ke chah chakke lagane kii kahani bhi aapako kam romanchit nahin karegi, aise samay main to or bhi jab yuvaraj singh ne antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas le liya he
 If you are a fan of cricket or ever want to do journalism in the field of sports, then you must read this book
 
 
 
 Finally - we can call this book the 'history' of Indian cricket

 Satyajit Ray's films have some common features that are not usually seen in mainstream Indian cinema
 ye sabhi filmein yathartwaadee hai, haalanki unke sandarbh or prishthbhumi bahut alag-alag hai, jo gaanv se lekar shaharon tak aitihaasik se lekar samakaleen tak faili hai
 The cinematic nuances of the film, especially the attention and the narrated parts of it, is one of the most powerful features of Ray's cinema
 re ke kirdaar jatil shakhsiyaten hai jo nijee gafalton or duvidhaon se jujh rahe hai
 These misgivings often relate to entangled sexual desires and family relationships within the home, while also dealing with larger social issues
 ve inasaani jajbaat ko parat-dar-parat kholane ke liye sanvaadon par nirbhar karne kii bajaae apni dhimi style main chehron, deh or bhav-bhangimaaon par focus karte hai
 His films are a study of love — not just romantic love, but love within the family and friendship in a larger world
 unke kirdaar pyaar kii talash karte hai, use pate hai, aksar kho dete hai or phir saajha vajood ke nae myne talashte hai
 After going through the experience of the humanity of these films, you feel richer and more sublime

 Despite all the popularity, it will probably be most difficult for the Modi government to convince the farmers that the acquisition of land is justified, just as the Congress government failed to convince investors that it was moving forward on the path of economic reforms
 jameen, pradhanmantri narendra modi ke rajnatik kaushal kii sabase kadi pariksha lene vaali he
 With liberalizing land acquisition, land, villages, farmers, farming and voluntary organizations are returning to the center of political debates that were left out of the bjp's high-profile electoral discourse
 kanoon main adhyadeshi badlaav saahasik hai lekin shuruyaat sahmati se hoti to behatar tha, kyonki jameen ko lekar samvedansheeltaa charam par he
 The hoarding and arbitrary occupation of land has spoiled the atmosphere and almost every state is sitting on landmines of land acquisition disputes
 is samvedansheel kanoon ko udaar karte hue kismat, sarkaar ke saath nahin he
 Changes in the domestic and foreign environment are weakening the good days of farming
 2008 se 2014 ke bich fasalon kaa samarthan mulya 130 fisadi badha jabaki isse pehle aath varshon main badhotaree keval 30 fisadi thi
 Between 2009 and 2013, the government purchased twice as much grain as the buffer stock required
 samarthan mulyon main is kadar ijapha or anaaj kii baari sarkari kharid tarksangat nahin thi
 But this made market farming viable
 modi sarkaar ne satta main aane ke baad samarthan mulya par bonus tay karne main rajyon ke adhikaar simit kar die
 This ban was also practical but has been opposed within the BJP and also in Parliament
 pichley ek dashak main kheti main chaar fisadi kii ausat growth ke baavjood 2009 se 2014 tak khaadya utpaadon main mahangaai kaa ganit kheti ke paksh main tha
 India's agricultural exports also tripled between 2010 and 2013 as the global market for agricultural products increased
 neshnal sample survey kii taaja report bataati he ki behatar kheti or gramin rojgaar guarantee par baari kharch ke chalate krishi mazdooree chah fisadi (mahangaai nikaal kar) salanaa kii dar se badi he jo pichley ek dashak main sarvaadhik he
 However, the survey also shows that during the best decade for farming, about 52% of the farmers were in debt
 un par bakaayaa karj main 26 fisadi hissaa soodakhor mahajanon kaa he
 The environment, amidst declining prices of food products, a surge in support prices and a decline in the global commodity market, is now against farming and farmer suicides are making it more complicated
 isliye bhoomi adhigrahan ko lekar samvedansheeltaa kai guna badaae vaali he
 Land is fully prepared for the politics of rural, farmer and voluntary organizations as the land acquisition system, after the ordinance, will be in a pre-2013 law on many scales
 jahaan nijee-sarkari bhagidaari kii pariyojnaon sahit lagbhag sabhi bade nirmaanon ke liye bhu-swaamiyon kii anumati yaa adhigrahan ke jeevika par asar ke akalan kii shart hataa lee gai he
 The bjp's political hand is tight to stop this protest
 bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main badlaav par party ke saansadon va sangh parivaar ko tatolte hue, is asamanjas ko khulkar mahasoos bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Modi's entire election campaign used to communicate with cities, villages were not in discussion
 sangh parivaar se madad kii gunjaaish kam hi he kyonki swadeshi jaagran manch to upie se bhi sakht adhigrahan kanoon kaa masauda banaakar baitha tha
 The BJP is a party of cities, accusations of nurturing the favorite industries have been put on its back which will devour the arguments to liberalize land acquisition
 congress chunaav ke khauf main thi isliye usne sabhi pakshon se mashvira kiye bagaiyr ek betuka bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon desh par thope diya, jisase na kisaanon ko phayda mila or na udyogon ko
 Similarly, BJP has jumped on the ordinance to save its credibility on economic reforms, on the basis of which neither acquisition nor investment will happen
 sansad se manjuuri va sahmati ke baad hi baat aage badhegi
 The government could have reduced the edge of possible opposition by trying to get consensus on changes in this law
 dilachasp he ki sarkaar ke is bade rajnatik jokhim ke baavjood udyog khush nahin he kyonki gaiyr buniyadi dhaancha nivesh ke liye adhigrahan kii sharten jas kii tas hai or zyaadaatar nivesh menuphaccharing main hi hona he
 Actually, by showing the arrogance of the ordinance, the government has made the land acquisition land more stony
 modi us samay gujarat ke mukhiya the jab sitambar 2012 main surendranagar va mehsana jilon ke 44 gaanvon ko milakar mandal bechraji special investment rigen banane kii adhisuchana jari hui thi
 The protests that lasted for a year finally reached Gandhinagar and in August 2013, 36 villages were taken out of the takeover, reducing the scope of the Special Investment Region
 gujarat bijepi ke netaa bhi maanate hai ki 12 varsh main pehali baar kisi janandolan ke saamne modi sarkaar ko hathiyaar daalane pade the
 With the change in the Land Acquisition Act, the Modi government is at a critical juncture in politics
 vikaas ke liye jameen kii aapurti or bhoomi adhikaron kii hifaazat ke bich santulan behad najuk he
 Modi now not only needs a lot of help from the Sangh Parivar and the opposition, but also needs mass public support
 koi shaq nahin ki agar modi, bhoomi adhigrahan ke phaayde kisaanon ko samaj sake to unki safalataa kaa paracham khet se kaarkaanon tak laharaayega
 But at present, the land acquisition and the landmass are desperate to test their political efficiency
 bihar main chunaav kaa sijan bas aane hi vaala he
 In such a situation, many leaders are exceeding the extent of happiness in the ticket jugaad
 pradesh ke motihaari main ek samaaroh main purv emelsi samet kai netaa argedy supreme lalu prasad ko juute pehanaane ke liye ek saath tut pade
 Looking at the pictures, it looks like there is a 'mahamukabala' going on to please Lalu Prasad
 lalu jab juuta pahanane ko taiyaar hue, to purv emelsi anwar alam unhen khud juuta pehanaane lage
 After this, many other leaders bowed down on their knees to put them on a shoe
 vaise argedy supremeo ke badbolapan kaa bhi koi jawaab nahin he
 Lalu claimed that no one could rule in Bihar without him
 unhone kaha ki nitish to sarkaar ko thelkar chalaa rahe hai
 Lalu had come to Jamunia village in his village Kalyanpur block to unveil the statue of former MLA Jamuna Yadav

 mumbai sthit punjab neshnal bank kii brady house branch ke farjivade se neerav modi kii kaali karatuuton se jo paraten hatni shuru huin to bank frod kii aanch upi ke kanpur tak pahunch gai
 After diamond merchant Nirav Modi, now the owner of Rotomac Pen is Vikram Kothari
 kothaari par bank of baroda samet saat bainkon se 2919 karod kaa karj lekar gatak jane kaa aarope he
 If the tax is added by levying interest on this amount, then the total liability of seven banks on Kothari is Rs 3695 crore
 ye he puri kahani-kothaari ne elahabaad bank, bank of india, bank of baroda, indian oversij bank or union bank of india samet 7 bainkon se lone liya tha
 According to CBI, this scam was going on since 2008
 ye he lone kaa vivaran:bank of india- 754
 77 crore Bank of Baroda - 456
 63 karodindian orvasij bank- 771
 77 Crore Bank of India - 458

 39 karod rupee he
 The entire amount including interest on this loan is Rs 3696 crore
 kothaari ne ab tak na ye mooldhan chukaaya he or na hi is par laga byaaj diya he
 After one year of the loan, when Kothari did not pay the original loan amount nor paid the interest of the loan amount, the bank started taking action
 -sabase pehle kothaari ko karj dene vaale bainkon main shaamil bank of baroda ne rotomac global privet limited ko pichley saal jaanboojhkar rinchook karne vaala (vilphul difolter) ghoshit kar diya

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the country for the second time from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day on 15 August
 sutron ke mutabik, piem modi apane bhaashan main sarkaar kii tarif karne ke saath congress par jamkar hamalaa bolne ke saath kai bade elaan kar sakate hai
 Know from the sources quoting how PM Modi's address can be from the Red Fort
 
 
 1:is baat kii badi sambhaavna he kii piem modipane sambodhanamen bhootpurv sainikon ke liye van rank van pension ko lagu karne karne kaa bhi elaan kar den
 Ex-servicemen movement is going on across the country on this issue

 With this, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and Beti Padhao Beti Bachao Abhiyan PM will speak fiercely about all their ambitious plans
 3:piem desh ke naam sambodhan main desh membhrashtachar ke maamlemen naukarshahon or duusare logon par unki sarkaar dwaara kii gayi karrwai ke bare main bhi bataanege
 4: Along with the situation of Jammu and Kashmir and the matter of financial help for the state, the steps taken by the states of the North East and the recent Naga agreement will be discussed
 5:pradhanmantri modi apane bhaashan main vipaksh khaastaur parcongress par bhi jamakarhamala bolenge
 Especially during the Monsoon Session, they will also crack the head of Congress for not doing any work in Parliament and not passing the GST and Land Bill
 6:bhale hi vipaksh piem modi apni videsh yatraaon par baar baar sawaal khadaa karata lekin modi laal kile se apane bhaashan main apni videsh yatraaon ke bare main bhi khub baat karenge
 The way the opposition has united to stop Modi in this Lok Sabha election has two major faces and both are women
 uttar pradesh main basapa pramukh mayawati ne apane kattar virdohi samaajawaadee party ke saath samjhauta kar bhaajapa ko jhatka diya
 In terms of arithmetic, the SP-BSP alliance is a big challenge for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh
 duusari taraf pashchim bengal main mukhyamantri or tiemasi pramukh mamata banerjee vipakshi kii majboot aawaaj banakar ubhari hai
 With the release of the election notification, the two women women began their election campaign, but by the end of the election, Mamata Banerjee has become the axis of complete opposition unity
 kul milakar mamata ne mayawati se bada kad hasil kar liya he
 The strength of Mamata Banerjee, who is currently seen as stronger than Mayawati, depends on the number of seats
 mayawati 38 siton par chunaav lard rahi he to mamata banerjee 42 siton par chunaav maidan main he
 In Uttar Pradesh, if the SP-BSP alliance is able to hold the BJP to 20 seats, then Mayawati's stature and importance will suddenly become bigger than Mamata, because the weaker the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, the more likely Modi's return to the Center will be Will be less
 iske ulat yadi bhaajapa, uttar pradesh main 40 se jitani adhik siten jite legi to yah nateeja mayawati ke kad ko mamata ke mukaable kamjor kar degaa
 If Mamata maintains her old performance in West Bengal (34 seats), her stature will automatically grow
 pichley kuch hafte main hi mamata main puure vipaksh ko jis tarah se ummid dikhne lagi he vah bhi unke kad ko bada hi kar rahaa he
 After the violence during the road show of Amit Shah in Kolkata, the way the entire opposition stood in support of Mamata, Mamta's importance increased to herself

 duniya kii number-1 team bharat or number-2 team dakshin africa ke bich dakshin africa main hone vaale is mukaable ke kaaphi romaanchak hone kii ummid kii ja rahi he or smith kaa maananaa he ki do satr pehle bharat main 0-3 kii haar ke baad mejabaan team atirikt prerit hogi
 Smith told PTI, 'I think South Africa's team will be very strong
 abi divilliars kii vaapasi se unki team kaaphi majboot najar aati he
 Bowling is also very strong
 unke paas chunane ke liye chaar behtareen anbhavi tej gendbaaj hai or kuch yuva tej gendbaaj bhi
 He said, "I think he will go with three fast bowlers and one spinner (keshav Maharaj) and six batsmen, while Quinton Dickock will bat at number seven
" ’ICC kii salanaa sarvshereshth team main mitali, ekta or harmanpreetahaalanki, smith kaa maananaa he ki bina abhyaas match ke test siries ke khilne vaale bharat ke liye pehle test kaa aayojan capatoun main phydemand ho saktaa he
 He said, 'I think India will have the best chance at Cape Town
 dakshin africa main gend kaa movement itnaa adhik pareshaan nahin karata, jo chunauti paidaa karata he vah atirikt oochaal he
 i expect that there will not be much movement on the wicket and there will be a slow bounce and the spinners will get some help as the game progresses
 ’chaar saal pehle gharelu sarajameen par bharat ke khilaaf 1-0 se siries jeetne vaale dakshin africa ke mahanatam captainon main se ek smith ne kaha, ‘pretoria (doosraa test) or johanisburg (teesraa test) bhartiya team ke liye badi chunauti hogi
 'virat Kohli-led Indian team is in excellent form and has won nine consecutive series
 inamen se adhikansh jeet haalanki up mahadweep main hasil kii gai
 When India last toured South Africa, captain Kohli, Murali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane were in good form, while Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan had to contend
 reetika ke Bday se thik pehle mili jeet se rohit khush, aise kiya wishsmiwa ke anusaar dhawan or rohit ab kahin behatar khilaadi hai, lekin del sten, morne morkal, varnon philendar or cagiso rabada jaise khilaadiyon vaale dakshin africa ke tej gendbaaji akraman ke saamne kohli or pujaara ahm ballebaaj honge
 He said, 'pujara and Kohli will be important batsmen
 ye do khilaadi pichhali baar acha khele the isliye ve mahatvapurn honge
 On Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah's fast bowling attack, who made it to the team for the first time, Smith said, "if India needs to succeed, their three fast bowlers need to bowl very well
 is
 sabhi bhartiya tej gendbaajon kii baat kar rahe hai
 i think the difference will be in the spell
 ’unhone kaha, ‘‘bharat main ve chote spel phenkate hai or prabhaav chhodane kii koshish karte hai, lekin dakshin main unhen dabaav main kahin adhik jimmedaari nibhaani hogi or lambey spel phenkane honge
 Fast bowlers will have to win matches for India
 up mahadweep kii tulana main maansikta bilkul alag hogi or yah dekhnaa hoga ki kya ve isse nipatakar jimmedaari nibhaa pate hai yaa nahin

 murali manohar joshi ke ghar par guuruuvaar ko ek ahm baithak hui jisamen is baat par charchaa hui kii court main ab is ladaai ko aage kaise ladaa jaae

 However LK Advani and Uma Bharti and Vinay Katiyar were not involved in this meeting
 uma bharti samet bijepi ke netaa yah bayaan dete rahe hai ki mandir andolan se jude hona unke liye garv kii baat he or vah iske liye parinaam kii parvaah nahin karte
 But the reality is that the decision of the Supreme Court has increased the trouble of these leaders
 supreme court ne na sirf babari masjid giraae jane ke aparaadhik shadyantr main shaamil hone kaa mukadmaa dobaaraa chalaane ko kaha he, balki jald faisla aane ke liye tamaam upaay bhi kiye hai
 Earlier two cases in this case were going on separately in Lucknow and Rae Bareli courts
 supreme court neadesh diya he ki in donon mukademon ko saath jod diya jaae taaki maamla teji se aage bad sake
 The court in its judgment has also directed that the case will be heard daily
 gavaahon ko har taarikh par maujuud rahanaa hoga or sunwaayee puure hone tak sambandhit jaj kaa transfar nahin kiya jayega
 The Supreme Court has ordered that the case be completed within 2 years
 court ke aadesh ke baad netaaon kii musiibat isliye bhi bad gai he ki ab unhen lakhanu court main sunwaayee par paini nigaah rakhni hogi
 It is also being said that after the Supreme Court verdict, the chances of Lal Krishna Advani becoming the President have come as a shock

 Sheila said that like any other she is a party worker and she will do as the party says
 yah puche jane par ki agar rahul gandhi adhyaksh banate hai, to unhen koi pareshaani he
 He said, 'this will be the decision of the party, which we all have to accept
 ' unhone kaha, 'hamen kisi se koi pareshaani kyon hogi
 However, she also said that Sonia Gandhi should continue to lead the party, as she takes everyone along

 You can also understand the importance of this university that on 10 January, Union Human Resource Minister Smriti Irani was present here
 jab vishvavidhyalay apana beesvaan sthapana diwas manaa rahaa tha or vaais chancelar ne mantri kii prashasti main kavita paath kar diya
 The Prime Minister became emotional while referring to Rohit Vemula in the last phase of his speech

 But as soon as the Prime Minister's speech ended, there was a flash on the news channels that the HR Minister has decided to set up a judicial commission to investigate all the circumstances and facts related to Rohit's suicide
 yah ayog teen maheene main apni report saunpega
 Smriti Irani spoke to Rohit's mother and expressed her condolences
 saamaajik or aarthik rup se kamazor chaatro ke saath ab bhedbhaav kii ghatnaayen na hon, unke muddon kii thik manch se sunwaayee ho sake iske liye mantralay ne desh ke sabhi ucch shikshan sansthaanon ke liye kuch kadam uthaae hai
 a program will be launched to sensitize socially, educationally and economically weaker students
 iske tahat academik prashasan se jude vyaktiyon ko samvedansheel banaaya jayega
 It will be mandatory for all the warden, administrative officer, registrar to participate in these programs
 iske liye ek vishesh madul banaaya jayega
 a special type of system will be created to take complaints and action of weak students
 sabhi vaais chancelar or varisht prashaskon ko training di jaaegi ki ve saamaajik aarthik or shaikshik rup se kamazor chaatro se rishta kaise banaae
 No negligence on campus will be tolerated at all
 iske liye ek vishesh charter yani ghoshnaptr jaldi hi jari kiya jane vaala he
 In the past, the courts had given orders to take such steps but ignored
 mantralay ke in faislon se desh ke sabhi shikshan sansthaanon ko kadaa sandesh janaa chahie
 The Andhra High Court had also ordered in 2013 to prevent the circumstances that the district judge should be made Ambudasman in all the universities to hear the appeal for suspension or dismissal action against the students but this was not followed properly
 ab yah bhi faisla hua he ki desh ke sabhi ucch shikshan sansthaanon main iaiti gandhinagar ke taiyaar kiye hue ek madul ko lagu kiya jayega
 This is called The Peer-group Assisted Learning (PAL)
 iske tahat saamaajik, shaikshik or aarthik rup se kamazor sabhi chaatro ko ek menter milegaa
 These mentors will not only help in studies but will also cooperate in other matters within the institutes
 2 november 2015 ko hamaare ahmedabad sahyogi rohit bhaan ne ek story file kii thi
 Rohit has stated that the module of The Peer-group Assisted Learning (PAL) was prepared in 2012 by Prof Kabir Jasuja
 iske tahat sabhi vishyon ke chaatro ko bhaavnaatmak or padhai ke tanaav or dabaav se muqabla karne ke liye senior ko menter banaaya jaataa he
 Professor who teaches Chemical Engineer
 kabir ne bataaya ki duusare or tisare varsh ke chaatr kaa chayan kiya jaataa he ki ve pratham varsh ke chaatro kii madad karenge
 This is gradually improving the performance of the students
 rohit bhaan ne story isliye kii thi kyonki kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne is vyavastha ko sabhi iaiti ke liye lagu karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The same will now be implemented in all higher educational institutions
 menter banane vaale senior ko iaiti gandhinagar prati ghanta 125 rupee detii he
 Due to this, 20 senior students have come forward for mentoring for 42 students

 The Human Resources Ministry had sent an inquiry team of two members to Hyderabad, the team submitted its report

 After the court's intervention, an FIR has been registered against the Vice Chancellor of Rajasthan Central University in Ajmer on Thursday
 isamen chah anya prophessoron ke bhi naam hai
 All of them have been accused by phd student Umesh Jonwal that guide Ullas Jadhav harassed VC and got him out of the university
 pichley oktober main jab jonwal ne shikaayat kii thi tab police ne exiaar bhi nahin kii thi
 It is recorded after a court order on Thursday
 jonwal ko 15 din tak anupasthit rahane ke kaaran vishvavidhyalay se nikaal diya gaya tha
 The steps that Smriti Irani has taken will also ensure that there will not be political interference in them
 is bich hyderabad se khabar ai he ki vishvadyalay ne rohit vemula chakravarti ke parivaar ko 8 lakh rupaya dene kaa faisla kiya he
 a draft of eight lakhs will be handed over to Rohit's mother
 abhi bhi saat chaatr bhukh hadtaal par hai
 An association of ten students has formed a joint action committee
 isamen abivipi nahin he
 a general body meeting was also held on Friday to bring the situation back to normal but the professors and students who resigned protested and said that VC should resign
 rohit vemula ke suicide note ko bhi forencik jaanch ke liye bheja gaya he
 Rohit's suicide note has been cut in many places
 us par rohit ne likhaa he ki ye line unhone khud kaati he phir bhi inaki forencik jaanch karai jaaegi
 Our colleague Uma Sudhir has said that the lines that have been cut indicate that Rohit was confused about the organizations he worked for and had some differences
 suicide note se aisa zaahir hota he ki rohit ne kaha he ki eyese or esefai apane hit ke liye hi kaam karte hai
 The police will also investigate why it took six hours to locate Rohit
 buudhvaar kii press conference main smriti irani ne kaha tha ki kaaryakari parishad kii up samiti ke mukhiya dalit professor the
 14 Dalits and other community professors resigned their administrative responsibilities, denying their claim as false

 We want to talk on the dwindling space of student politics on campus today, even more than that
 agar vishvavidhyalay main tamaam muddon par khulkar bahes nahin hogi to kahaan hogi
 Why does it happen that Ramdev is not allowed to come to JNU and Siddharth Varadarajan is not allowed to speak at Allahabad University because ABVP feels that his views are anti-national
 siddharth varadarajan rozaana tivi par bijepi ke netaaon ke bagal main baithkar bahes karte nazar aate hai
 His articles are published everywhere
 lekin akhil bhartiya vidhyaarthee parishad ke chaatro ne bolne nahin diya
 Similarly, JNU Students' Union declares that Ramdev will not be allowed to come here
 jeenyu chaatr sangh ke adhyaksh AISF ke hai
 Ramdev is seen giving speeches throughout the day on TV channels and in his yoga camps
 unhen jeenyu main kyon nahin suna ja saktaa
 It is another matter that Ramdev did not go to JNU for his own reasons later but he was opposed
 hamane kuch or google search kiya ki haal philhal main takaraav kii kya kya ghatnaayen huin hai to ek-ek kar kai chaatr sanghathanon ke naam nikalate gaye jinke naam marpet kii ghatana main shaamil hai
 Even in eating and killing
 aaj hi 22 janvari ko bengalooru main NSUI ke sadsy ABVP ke daftar ke baahar pradarshan karne lage jiske kaaran donon ke bich jhadap ho gai
 It is alleged that the student leader of ABVP has been attacked and the glass of the office has been broken
 paanch log hiraasat main bhi liye gaye hai
 The comments pichley saal 2 oktober ko kerala ke trichur ke shri kerala verma college main esefai or abivipi ke sadasyon ke bich jhadap ho gai
 SFI students were organizing the Beef Festival, which ABVP protested against eating beef on campus
 jamkar marpet hui or deccan chronical ke anusaar ABVP ke sadasyon ko chot bhi lagi
 The police registered a case against 12 members of the SFI based on the complaint of the students of ABVP
 SFI ke sadasyon kaa aarope tha ki ABVP ke sadasyon ne maaraa or unpar pakistani hone ke aarope lagaae
 The Indian Express dated 26 August 2015 reported that two members of the SFI were allegedly beaten up by members of the ABVP at Ramjas College in Delhi
 esefai chwis besd credit system kaa virodh kar rahe the
 According to the newspaper, the state secretary of ABVP admitted that there had been an incident of assault but members of his organization were not involved in such activities
 kerala ke kottayam main garvanment art college main ABVP or SFI ke sadasyon ke bich marpet main saat chaatr ghayal ho gaye
 Leaders of ABVP and SFI were admitted to the government hospital
 koun tay karegaa ki koun rashtravirohi he or kis mudde par ham aapako vichaar karne kii chhot denge or is mudde par nahin denge
 If different ideologies cannot communicate while struggling with each other, then why should their aggression not be considered as dagagiri
 chaahe wo SFI ho yaa ABVP yaa NSUI
 Mother Bharti has lost her red and could have said more so that this incident would instill confidence in the angry sections and send a message to all the universities that any kind of negligence will not be tolerated
 lekin pradhanmantri kaa bhaashan samaapt hote hi news channelon par flash hone laga ki maanav sansaadhan mantri ne rohit kii aatmahatya se judi tamaam paristhitiyon or tathyon kii jaanch karne ke liye nyaayik ayog ke gathan kaa faisla kiya he
 This commission will submit its report in three months
 smriti irani ne rohit kii maa se baat kii or apni samvednaa vyakt kii
 The Ministry has taken some steps for all higher educational institutions in the country so that there are no incidents of discrimination against socially and economically weaker students, their issues can be heard from the right platform
 saamaajik, shaikshik or aarthik rup se kamazor chaatro kii samasyaon ke prati samvedanshee banane ke liye ek kaarykram launch kiya jayega
 Under this, people associated with academic administration will be sensitized
 sabhi warden, prashasnic adhikari, register ke liye in kaaryakramon main hissaa lenaa anivaary hoga
 a special module will be made for this
 kamazor chaatro kii shikaayatein lene or karrwai karne ke liye vishesh prakaar kaa system banegaa
 All Vice Chancellors and Senior Administrators will be trained on how to build relationships with socioeconomically and educationally weaker students
 campus main bhedbhaav ko lekar zaraa bhi laaparvaahee bardaasht nahin kii jaaegi
 a special charter for this is to be issued soon
 pehle bhi adaalaton ne is tarah ke kadam uthaane ke aadesh diye gaye the magar dhyaan nahin diya gaya
 These decisions of the Ministry should send a strong message to all educational institutions in the country
 andhra hoicourt ne bhi aisi paristhitiyon ko rokane keliye 2013 main aadesh diye the ki chaatro ke khilaaf nilamban yaa barkhaastagi kii karrwai kii apil sunne ke liye sabhi vishvavidhyalay main zila jaj ko ambudsman banaaya jaae magar iskaa thik se paalan nahin hua
 Now it has also been decided that a module prepared by IIT Gandhinagar will be implemented in all higher educational institutions of the country
 ise The Peer-group Assisted Learning (PAL) kaha jaataa he
 Under this, all students who are socially, educationally and economically weak will get a mentor
 ye menter na sirf padhai main madad karenge balki sansthaanon ke bheetar anya maamalon main sahyog karenge
 On 2 November 2015, our Ahmedabad colleague Rohit Bhan filed a story
 rohit ne bataaya he ki The Peer-group Assisted Learning (PAL) kaa madul 2012 main pro kabir jasuja ne taiyaar kiya tha
 Under this, senior students are made mentors to cope with the emotional and academic stress and pressure of students of all disciplines
 chemical ejeeniyar padhaane vaale pro
 Kabir said that the second and third year students are selected to help the first year students
 isse chaatro kaa pradarshan dhire-dhire behatar ho rahaa he
 The story was done by Rohit Bhan because the Union HRD Ministry decided to implement this system for all iits
 isi ko ab sabhi ucch shikshan sansthaanon main lagu kiya jayega
 IIT Gandhinagar pays Rs 125 per hour to senior mentors
 iske kaaran 42 chaatro ke liye 20 senior chaatr menter ke liye aage aae hai
 Another teacher from IIT Delhi has praised this system
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne do sadasyon kii ek jaanch team hyderabad bheji thi, team ne apni report saunp di he
 The impact of this incident should be seen in the universities of the country, but there has also been news of appearing from a place
 court ke hastkshep ke baad guuruuvaar ko ajmer main rajasthan central university ke vaais chancelar ke khilaaf exiaar darj kii gai he
 It also has the names of six other professors
 in sabhi par piechdi ke chaatr umesh jonwal ne aarope lagaaya he ki guide ullas jadhav ne visi se milakar pareshaan kiya or vishvavidhyalay se nikalava diya
 The police did not even register an FIR when Jonwal complained last October
 guuruuvaar ko court ke aadesh ke baad darj kiya gaya he
 Jonwal was expelled from the university after being absent for 15 days
 smriti irani ne jo kadam uthaaye hai kya vah yah bhi sunishchit karengi ki unamem raajnneetik dakhlandaazi nahin hogi
 Meanwhile, there has been news from Hyderabad that the university has decided to give Rs 8 lakh to Rohit Vemula Chakraborty's family
 aath lakh kaa draft rohit kii maa ko saunp diya jayega
 Seven students are still on hunger strike
 das chaatro ke sanghathan ne milakar ek joint acshan cameti banaai he
 It does not have ABVP
 shuukravaar ko general body meeting bhi hui taaki sthiti saamaanya ho sake lekin istipha dene vaale prophessoron or chaatro ne virodh kiya or kaha ki visi kaa istipha hona chahie
 Rohit Vemula's suicide note has also been sent for forensic investigation
 rohit ke suicide note main kai jagahon par kaata gaya he
 On that, Rohit has written that he has cut this line himself, yet his forensic investigation will be done
 hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne bataaya he ki jin panktiyon ko kaata gaya he usase zaahir hota he ki rohit jin sanghathanon ke liye kaam karata tha, unhen lekar bhramit tha or unase kuch matbhed the
 The suicide note shows that Rohit has said that ASA and SFI work for their own interest
 police yah bhi jaanch karegi ki rohit kaa pataa lagane main chah ghante kyon lage
 At Wednesday's press conference, Smriti Irani said that the head of the executive committee sub-committee was a Dalit professor
 unke is daawey ko galat bataate hue 14 dalit or anya samudaay ke prophessoron ne apane prashasnic dayitvon se istipha de diya
 There has been no clarification from the Union Ministry of Human Resources on this matter
 ham aaj campus main chaatr raajnneeti balki usase bhi zyada vichaar vimarsh ke ghatate spes par baat karnaa chaahate hai
 Where all the issues will not be openly debated in the university
 kyon aisa hota he ki jeenyu main ramdev ko nahin aane diya jaataa he or elahabaad vishvavidhyalay main siddharth varadarajan ko isliye nahin bolne diya jaataa he kyonki abivipi ko lagata he ki unke vichaar rashtravirohi hai
 Siddharth Varadarajan is seen sitting on TV everyday arguing with BJP leaders
 unke lekh har jagah chhapate hai
 But the students of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad did not let them speak
 usee tarah jeenyu chaatr sangh elaan karata he ki ramdev ko apane yahaan nahin aane denge
 The president of the JNU Students' Union is AISF
 ramdev to din bhar tivi channelon or apane yoga shiviron main bhaashan dete nazar aate hai
 Why can't they be heard in JNU
 ye or baat he ki ramdev baad main apane kaarnon se jeenyu nahin gaye lekin unka virodh to hua hi
 We did some more Google searches as to what have been the incidents of confrontation in the recent past, so one by one the names of several student organizations have come out, whose names are involved in the incident of assault
 maar khaane main bhi or maarane main bhi
 Today, on 22 January, members of the NSUI began to protest outside the ABVP office in Bengaluru, causing a clash between the two

 Five people have also been taken into custody

 There was fierce fighting and according to Deccan Chronicle, members of ABVP were also hurt

 SFI members alleged that members of ABVP killed and accused them of being Pakistani
 26 agast 2015 ke indian express main khabar chhapi he ki dilli ke ramajas college main ABVP ke sadasyon ne esefai ke do sadasyon ko kathith rup se peet diya
