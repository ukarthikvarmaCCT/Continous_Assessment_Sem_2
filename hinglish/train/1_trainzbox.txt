 use baahar se bina chaabi ke nahin kholaa ja saktaa, lekin use andar se bina chaabi ke kholaa ja saktaa tha
 No explanation was given by the accused about how and who opened the door of Aarushi's room
 chatha kaaran yah ki us raat main internet chaalu tha jisase yah baat spasht hoti he ki aropiyon main se ek jagaa hua tha
 That there is nothing to show that any outsider came inside the house after half past nine in the night
 yah ki us raat ko bijli aapurti main koi baadha nahin thi
 No one was seen walking near the flat under suspicious circumstances during the night
 yah ki ghatana vaale din kisi bhi bahari vyakti ke flats main jabardasti pravesh karne kaa koi saboot nahin he
 There is no evidence of theft in the flat
 yah ki 16 may 2008 kii subah jab naukaraani flats kii safai ke liye ai to noopur talwaar ne jhootha bahaanaa banaaya ki ho saktaa he ki naukar hemraj ne darwaja baahar se band kar diya ho jabaki taala baahar se band nahin tha

 Book excerpt: Forgotten Blessing Revolutionary Vinodar Damodar Savarkar: Criticism Only for criticism, the petty parties and the Congress started a propaganda against this great patriot on the petitions of Savarkar
 angreji bhashaa ke ek pramukh samachar-patr main ek raajnneetik tippaneekar ne likhaa ki saavarkar ke sammaan kaa yah kadam isliye uthaaya gaya he, taaki mahatma gandhi kii hatya ke shadyantr main unki bhoomika par 'safedi potee' ja sake
 No evidence was found against Savarkar
 mubir digambar bagade ne yah bayaan jarur diya tha ki usne saavarkar dwaara godse ko apane lakshya main kaamyaab hone kii mangal kaamana karte suna tha, lekin nyaayalay ne us par vishwaas nahin kiya
 The court acquitted Savarkar in the conspiracy to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi
 tatkaaleen sarkaar kaa uddeshy is maamle main 'hindu mahasabha' ke netaa ko phasaana tha
 This objective was fulfilled
 parantu is mahan deshbhakt kii mrityu ke baad bhi us par keechad oochaalnaa jari he
 Savarkar was a revolutionary and wanted to join the freedom movement by somehow getting out of jail
 unhen hamaare prasiddh itihaaskaaron kii bajaay british shaasha zyada acchhee tarah jaanate the
 There are documents in national archives that reveal what the British rulers thought of Savarkar and his petition
 andaman dwipon main jab saavarkar bandi the, tab 1913 main british sarkaar ke samaksh unki dayaa yachika ke bare main kaaphi kuch kaha ja rahaa tha
 Bipinchandra and his group of prominent historians have repeatedly raised this issue
 unhen yah pataa hona chahie ki saavarkar ko jail se chhodane ke liye 1911 se 1920 ke bich ek baar nahin, balki aath baar yachika daayar kii gai
 He was not such a satyagrahi
 aalochakon kaa munh bandabritish grahamantri mekapherasan ne saavarkar kii yachika par ek tippanee ankit kii thi
 He wrote- 'leaving Savarkar will prove dangerous for the British Empire
 uski yah yachika jail se chhootane kii ek chaal he
 Once left, it will reorganize the underground movement against the British ruler
 isliye main is yachika ko is aadhaar par radd karata hoon, kyonki isse janata kii suraksha ko khatra paidaa ho jayega
 "bharat Ratna" should be given to Veer Savarkar Kovinayak Damodar Savarkar is such a powerful constellation of Indian freedom struggle, whose brightness will never fade
 ve aise prakhar rashtrabhakt the, jinhone apni sukh-suvidhaon ko purna rup se tilanjali de swechha se sangharsh kaa kantakakirn maarg sweekaar kiya
 He made his life-goal for the country to live in severe sufferings and to constantly strive for freedom

 Shyamji Krishna Verma, Lala Hardayal, Vinayak Savarkar and Rasbihari Bose were also highly educated and scholars of many disciplines, while Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was a historian, writer, poet, novelist, philosopher, social reformer and visionary observer
 yah bhi koi sanyog nahin tha ki vir saavarkar ne us kul main janm liya, jiske teenon sapoot swatantry yoddha the
 Older brother Ganeshpant (babarao) Savarkar received life-long black water punishment and younger brother Dr
 narayanrav (bal) saavarkar ko bhi lord minto par bam prahaar ke maamle main karawas main rahanaa padaa tha
 In fact, the Savarkar brothers drew inspiration from the immortal sacrifice of the Chapekar brothers
 damodar, baalkrishna tathaa vasudev chapekar bhi swatantry devi kii upasna karte hue phaansi par chadh gaye the
 On 16 May 1899, Vasudev Chapekar and his aide Mahadev Ranade were hanged
 unki shahadat kaa samachar milte hi 16 varsh ke tarun vinayak saavarkar ne bhagur main apni kuladevi ke saamne aajanm desh kii swatantraaa ke liye sangharsh karne kii pratigya kar lee
 It was such a Bhishma vow, which he performed literally
 bharat main sarvapratham videshi kapadon kii holi jalaanevaale vinayak saavarkar hi the
 After completing law education in India, he went to London for the education of barristers and made the 'india House' there the center of revolutionaries
 landan main adhyayan karte hue saavarkar ne magini kaa charitra likhaa, jo prakashit hote hi hathohath bik gaya
 After this, he wrote 'swatantra Samar of 1857', which was a unique thesis
 landan main unke shishy madanlaal ne karjan vyli ko mrityudand dekar bhartiya swatantraaa kaa udghosh england main bhi kar diya
 After all how Savarkar would have survived
 angrej sarkaar ne unhen bandi kar bharat laane kii yojana banaai to france ke marsoli bandargah ke paas saavarkar jahaaj se samudr main kud gaye or tairte hue france kii dharti par pahunch gaye
 The British police arrested Savarkar again, stating that international laws were Dhatta and brought him to India and sent him to Kalapani (andaman), sentenced to life imprisonment
 das varshon tak vir saavarkar ne andaman main ammanushik yatnaayen sahan kin
 In the cellular jail, he looted the peels, ran the crusher, suffered solitary confinement in handcuffs and suffered severe illness
 is sab ke unhone bich adhyayan karne kaa abhyaas banaae rakhaa, saath hi kaidiyon ko sanskaarit or jaagrath karne kaa kaary bhi unhone kiya
 He used to write poems on the walls of the prison with nail and coal

 Trouble over the installation of Savarkar's statue in France - Government collapsing when 'secret document leaks'

 Marseilles is a French city by the sea
 vir saavarkar ko jab british sarkaar landan se pakadakar bharat laa rahi thi to vah jahaaj se samudr main kud gaye the or tairkar isi francisi shahar main pahunche the
 The French guards captured Savarkar and handed him over to the British rule
 is par madam kama hegg kii international court main gayi
 It is another matter that the case was dismissed on 24 February 1911 under British pressure, but there was a revolt in France
 pradhanmantri ko istipha dena padaa
 Now 99 years later the Mayor of Marseilles has written a letter to his government that we want Savarkar's statue to be placed on the sea shore
 par na yah chitthee li hui, na sarkaar ne jawaab bheja
 Gopinath Munde leaked this letter in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday
 aap puuchhenge, buudhvaar ko hi kyon, to bataa den ki buudhvaar ko 8 july thi
 On July 8, 1910, the French government handed over Savarkar to the British, so Gopinath Munde specifically chose this day
 aaj se us ghatana kaa shatabdi varsh shuru ho gaya so murti lagane kaa yah khaas saal he
 Munde asked the government, 'why is the government not responding? ' sarkaar kii ghiggi bandh gai
 Advani leader Advani had to raise the matter, then Sushma Swaraj opened the third front
 afat aan padi to narayansami bole ki 've is mudde par videshmantri se baat karenge
 'but the question is not of the answer in the House and not to press the letter
 mumbai ke sethu kaa naam saavarkar sethu tha to badal diya
 Removed a strip of Savarkar's name at Port Blair's airport
 ab france main murti sthapit karne par bhi adnga congress sarkaar kaa he
 'oh, don't sit down, you will have to complete the oil by evening, otherwise you will be beaten and punished will be different
 ' is tarah uske cheekhney-chillane se kaiyon ke gale se cor nahin utarataa, kyonki shaam tak tel kam bharte hi nity laaton-ghunson-sotiyon se bandiyon ko kutate-pitate har koi dekhtaa tha
 Due to this fear, even though the rats are jumping in the stomach, the crusher is rotating from the plate in which the edge of sweat is falling, standing in the mouth, lifting the grass and swallowing it and moving the crusher
 i have seen many detainees many times with my own eyes while having food
 ant main unhen kaam kam karne ke liye dand diya gaya, kam bhojan diya gaya
 After all, the superintendent made a contract that if he works for three days, he will remove you from the crusher
 uske anusaar shriman ne vaidyak shastreey niyam ko utane samay tak aale par rakhkar teen din puraa kaam kiya, parantu unhen itnaa jhukate hue dekhakar baari ne tote kii tarah ankhen pherin or anubandh todakar unhen phir kolhu par bheja
 He retorted, - Will not work! We are human beings, not bulls
 ' yaheen se pratham hadtaal kaa shriganesh ho gaya
 Turning the eyes of the Rajbandis again and seeing them coming till the strike, Bari was also shocked
 jo rajbandi hadtaal main shaamil ho gaye, un par dandon kii bharmaar hone lagi
 For eight days, punishments were given under handcuffs, fetters, closet etc
 etc
 Punishments were also given against the rules
 uparyukt shriman jo sadrush-nirbhiktapurvak vyavhaar karte, unka ghamand chur-chur karne ke liye unhen das-das, baarah-baarah din kanji ke atirikt anya kuch khaane ke liye nahin diya gaya
 It is not a rule in prison that ten-ten days be kept only on kanji, but with the hope that by staying on the given platform only two or three times, their power will be reduced and morale will be broken
 yah dand diya gaya, par kisi bandi ke dand-patrak main use likhaa nahin jaataa
 Later, when a senior officer from the Hindusthan government came to investigate and the Rajbandis pointed out the penalty against the rules, on the basis of this penal sheet, Bari proved this allegation to be false and those officers gave him the honor took
 mujhe in sahabandiyon ne shapathpurvak kaha tha ki ek ore unhen us maand par rakhaa jaataa tha, to duusari ore, yadi virodh kiya gaya to kunen ke ghunt unke gale main undele jate the
 This would have made them dizzy, there would have been a lot of pain due to burning sensation in the stomach, but in the face of all these atrocities, the strike people did not give up their arms
 itnaa hi nahin, yah jaanakar ki in bandiyon kaa drudh sanghathan he or unka dhairya dekhakar anya bandiyon par bhi baari kaa jo ammanushik dabadabaa tha, vah udan-chhu ho rahaa he to unhen yah aashwaasan diya gaya ki ab tumhen kolhu par nahin bheja jayega
 Like other prisoners, you too will be left to work in the outer islands of the prison
 rajbandiyon ko karagrih ke baahar ke bandi jo jaankaree dete, usase gyaat tha ki baahar prachur maatra main swatantraaa he
 Apart from this, once his right to exit is stamped, then after five years from his accession there will be a reference to get the right to work independently and after ten years to get the right to settle the house by taking a 'ticket' - Knowing the rage of the Rajbandis Wanted to somehow get out of here
 tab yah sunakar ki kam-se-kam tum logon ko ek varsh karagrihavaas puraa karne se niyamanusaar baahar choda jayega
 When the people realized that the purpose of the strike was successful, one by one they started going out of the strike and went to work
 chand dinon main hi kuch logon ko baahar nikaala gaya
 Many people got plucked in the car, after getting down to the chest in the mud, filling the mud, sweeping the road, hauling coconut etc
 andaman main gaadi main sarkari adhikari baithte hai or use khinchne ke liye bail-ghode aadi pashuon ko jotane se jo vyay hota, use bachaane ke liye bandiyon ko jota jaataa
 Constant running and big climbing, the gasping vehicles pulled and the abuses were seen coming from above
 main aise ek-do angrej adhikariyon ko jaanata hoon, jo is reeti ko naapsand karte hue bandiyon se gaadi nahin khinchvaate the, parantu aise kisi bandi ko nahin jaanata jo, gaadi khinchne ke liye saaf manaa karata
 However, Bari's sharpness was not correct, but a thick intellect showed it to everyone
 suparintendent ke man par yah ankit karne ke liye ki rajbandi kitne updravi va ziddee hai, baari ne hawaldaar ko soochna di thi ki unamem se ek-do abhimaani tathaa nirbhik logon ko baahar nikaalte hi gaadi main jota jaae
 As soon as the order was given to pull the car, those fearless people gave a slight reply that we are not bulls, who pull the car of human beings
 baari ne tapaak se suparintendent se kaha, 'dekha, kitne badmaash hai ye log
 Their rhyme in the jail was that we would not feed the crusher
 ab inhen baahar nikaala to kehete hai, gaadi nahin khinchenge
 Now you tell me, where should i bring such work for these civilized people, which is not guilty and if i listen to their complaints on any other accessible or polite work, then i will not be accused of being biased in the eyes of other prisoners

 Ajitsingh and Kishan Singh came to that meeting secretly and urged the raja-maharajas to make revolution like 1857 against the British
 is kaary ke liye unako keval ‘aashwaasan’ ke atirikt kuch nahin mila
 In 1906 Ajit Singh formed the organization of 'bharatmata Society', Mehboobe Watan

 The peasants' movement in Punjab started in opposition to the two laws of the British, one was the 'colonial law' and the other was the 'doab Bari Act'
 ajitsingh or ‘bharatmata socity’ ke sadsy andolankaaree krishakon kii sabhaaon ko angrejon ke viruddh balava karne ke liye prerit karte rahe
 Ajitsingh peasants used to come to the rally by holding a tricolor flag on the two and a half feet flag as a mark in the rallies and Ajit Singh took the flag from the stage and told the audience that the flag would beat the British
 3 march, 1907 ko lailpur main ek vishaal raily main ‘jhang syal’ akhbaar ke sampadak bankedayal ne ek gaanaa gaaya, jiske bol the- ‘pagadi sanbhaal jattha, pagadi sanbhaal oe’ yah gaanaa itnaa lokapriy hua ki yah andolan itihaas main ‘pagadi sanbhaal jattha’ andolan kahalaaya
 Ajitsingh, while citing the reasons for making Lailpur the center of the movement, said that the area has undergone new development

 In many places the soldiers refused to shoot at the protesters

 punjab ke governor lord dabbotson ne vysarai lord hordings ko telegram kiya- ajitsingh kii netagiri main punjab ke halaat vidroh ke kinare tak pahunch gaye hai, ise rokane ke liye turant prabandh karne chahie
 An organization 'bharatmata Book Agency' was also formed to provide information to the public and print pamphlets, thus the 'bharatmata Society' movement became famous as 'small 1857' (little 1857)
 angrejon ne ‘bharatmata socity’ ke pramukh sadasyon sardaar kishan singh, sardaar swarnasingh, lala lalachandra falak, lala govardhan, mahashay ghasitharam, pandit ramchandra peshawari, inako pakadakar jelon main thuns diya gaya

 ajit singh kaa raajnneetik kariyar 1906-07 ke bich punjab ke ‘krishak andolan’ se shuru hua
 After the 'punjab Colonization Bill' of 1906, the increase in land tax and irrigation taxes caused great dissatisfaction in rural areas
 is bill se bhootpurv sainikon ko chenab colony ke kheton ke tukade karne par roak laga di
 This law was an attack on the rights of property division of farmers
 is bill se bhadki asantosh kii jwaala adhik ugr rup dhaaran karne lagi, jab ‘punjabi’ naam sarkaar-virdohi dwi-saptahik angreji akhbaar ke sampadak par 1907 main mukadmaa chalaaya
 In such a social upheaval, Ajitsingh formed a revolutionary organization 'bharatmata Society' in 1907, headquartered in Lahore

 At these events, Ajitsinh in his speeches, along with the problems of the farmers, also inspired Indians to struggle to overthrow the British Empire

 This army of terrorists, which is spreading rapidly in Pakistan, has become the biggest threat to the world, but the biggest target of these dangerous terrorists is India
 america sanstha rand yani research and deveopment corporation kii mumbai hamalon ke baad ai report is baat kaa bhi khulaasa karti he kis tarah pakistani fouj or uski khufia angency aatankwaad ke is daanav ko shah de rahaa he
 It has been said in the report that the terror in Pakistan is actually an extension of the agenda of its army and intelligence agency ISI and it is difficult to end this campaign until the Pakistani army and ISI are controlled
 
 ye baat duniya se chhipi nahin ki pakistan main fouj or khufia agency iesai kii dhauns ke saamne vahaan kii chuni hui sarkaar ghutane tekti rahi he or jab tak satta kaa ye sameekaran nahin badalata aatankwaad par kaabo paanaa mumkin nahin
 According to Rand's report, India's failed security and intelligence system also makes it an easy target for terror
 mumbai or isse pehle hui kai badi aatankwaadi vaaradaaten ye sabit karne ke liye kaaphi he ki chaahe wo aatankwaadiyon kii sajeesh se judi soochnaaon ko saajha karne kii baat ho chaahe us par karrwai kaa maamla
 Indian security and intelligence agencies neither have adequate training nor necessary equipment and weapons and topped it so that there is no coordination between these agencies
 phir parmaanu pareekshan ke baad pakistani sena, iesai or dehshatgardon ko is baat kaa yakeen ho gaya he ki wo chaahe jitna hamalaa karen bharat pakistan ke khilaaf koi karrwai karne kii himmat nahin karegaa or ab tak yahi hota bhi rahaa he
 In such a situation, India has no other option but to tolerate terrorist attacks
 report ke mutabik lashkar-e-taiyaba jaise sanghathan jo pehle pakistani sena auki iesai kii madad ke mohataaj the ab khudamukhtaar hote ja rahe hai
 Rand's report also exposed the twopence of US policy on the issue of terrorism
 america prashasan ke bade adhikariyon ke hawaale se kaha gaya he ki america lashkar-e-tayba par pratibandh lagane se bachanaa chahta tha kyonki use is baat kaa dar sata rahaa tha ki isse pakistani sena ke saath uske rishton par kharaab asar padegaa, jabaki lashkar ke aatankwaadi afghanistan ke kunar or nuristan main uski fouj ko bhi nishaanaa banaate rahe hai
 Obviously, the whole world will have to unite to end this terrorism that is flourishing in Pakistan

 May have learned lessons from mistakes
 us din edilade main ham test jeetna chaahate the or ham bangaleru main bhi aisa hi karenge

 We can learn a lot from the way he batted

 isse suraksha se samjhauta to hota hi he magar iskaa bhi sambandh hamaare nagarikon kii kamazor aarthik sthiti se he
 More children are forced to sit in a car because it reduces their expenses
 nae praavdhaan se ho saktaa he aise tabake par boj bad jaae
 But how to compromise security as well
 yah chunauti bhi to he
 Overloading of passenger trains will attract a fine of one thousand rupees per additional passenger
 towhilers kii overloding par 2000 rupye kaa jurmaana lagegaa or teen maheene ke liye license radd ho jayega
 Now if you seat three passengers on a bike, then only one hundred rupees is fine
 hit and ran ke maamalon main muaavze ko 25 hazaar rupye se badhaakar do lakh rupye karne kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Provision for compensation of up to Rs 10 lakh on death in road accidents
 nae sanshodhan main third party insurance ke clem or setlement kii prakriya ko aasaan bana diya gaya he
 Do people really get a compensation of one million, how many
 sarkaar kii niyat thik he, baat nitiyon main har aarthik tabake kii jagah kii he
 Increasing the penalty reduces the accident or increasing the presence of traffic police on the roads
 dilli main hi kareeb paanch hazaar trephic pulicekarmi hai jabaki zarurat he 10 se 11 hazaar trephic pulicekarmiyon kii
 There is a policeman on 2100 trains
 jo ki paryaapt nahin he
 If there is not enough traffic police force in Delhi itself, what will happen to other cities
 kya sadak durghatana main maare gaye sabhi log laaparvaah driving ke kaaran hi maare jate hai
 In May, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari held a meeting with stakeholders in the highway sector
 usamen unhone kaha tha ki hameshaa driver kii galati nahin hoti he
 Incorrect engineering is also responsible for many accidents
 isi may main haive sector ke hissedaaron kii baithak main kendriya mantri gadakari ne kaha tha, main nirdesh de rahaa hum ki jin sadakon par lagaataar durghatnaayen hoti hai, un sadakon kaa deepiar yani project report jin logon ne banaai he unhen bhi aaropee banaaya janaa chahie
 i will bring it into law
 kya kendriya mantri ne apane nae kanoon main ise shaamil kiya he, kyonki isi sandarbh main mangalvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar main chape saji cherian ke ek lekh kaa zikr karnaa chaahunga
 Cherian is the director of the Save Live Foundation
 bengalooru main sadak ke gadde ke kaaran ek bachche kii motorcycle se gir kar maut ho gai
 The police also registered a case against the engineer of the National Highway Authority
 baad main enechaeai ne apane kanoon ke section 28 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki agar uske adhikari ne acchhee niyat se kaam kiya he to uske kilaaf koi kanoonee kaarywahi nahin ho sakati he
 a case could not be filed against the officer
 kya gadakari enechaeai ko mili is chhot ko samaapt kar denge
 Have they registered a provision for registering a case against engineers due to a bad road, the road remains broken for a long time, accidents keep happening, can the government or minister be booked for this, does he know the road to be built Not approved police ke liye aasaan hota he, driver ko doshi bana dena
 Many times she works under the pressure of the crowd, before the crowd makes its decision
 is kanoon main durghatana ke vakt aisi bheed ke bare main kyon nahin kuch he, jiske dar se log bhaag jate hai or jisaki jaan batch sakati thi wo mar jaataa he
 It will also have to be seen whether more fine will reduce accidents or not, perhaps it will happen but it also has an economic side
 pichley saal sitambar main jab is masale par prime time kiya tha tab 'washington post' ke hawaale se america kii ek kahani sunai thi
 i want to hear it again
 yah kahani criminal justise par bloging karne vaale redley balko ne likhi thi
 The comments nichol bolden naam kii 32 saal kii ashwet mahila ek din car se kahin ja rahi thim
 Then the front car made a U-turn incorrectly and even after applying the brakes, Bolden's car collided
 bolden kii car main uske do chote bachche the lekin saamne kii car vaale ne police bulaai or bolden giraftaar ho gai
 Three warrants had already been issued against Bolden in violation of traffic rules as Bolden could not pay the fine due to weak economic conditions
 ek vakil ne bataaya he ki ise ham powarty vylation kehete hai yani garibi ke kaaran log jurmaana nahin de pate
 Failure to pay the premium for insurance, warrant for arrest if you fail to pay the fine
 bolden ne ek adaalat main kisi tarah zamaanat kii raashi to bhar di magar duusare warrant main giraftaar ho gai
 The organization of lawyers who helped such people made a lot of efforts to reduce the fine amount to less than US $ 1700
 1700 amareeki dollar matlab bhartiya rupee main ek lakh rupee se bhi adhik kii fine
 Somehow it was reduced to $ 700 i
e
 a little over 42 thousand
 is dauraan use 1 maheene se zyada jail main rahanaa padaa
 Lawyers say it is important to understand that this is not a crime
 galati he
 The Washington Post report says that a large number of people are not even able to hire a lawyer
 saint lui county kii kamai kaa 40 fisadi hissaa jurmaane se aata he
 The situation in America has become such that companies have opened up to get bail bonds filled
 baqayda ye bijness ho gaya he
 It is not necessary that this happens in India too, but if the amount of fine is high, we cannot ignore other problems
 kai jagahon par fine se sudhaar bhi aayaa he
 Driving a valid driving license will now result in a fine of five thousand rupees, which is now one thousand rupees
 bina vaid insurance ke gaadi chalaane par ek hazaar rupye ke bajaay do hazaar rupye kii penlti hogi
 On over speeding, light passenger vehicles will incur fine of one thousand rupees, medium-class passenger vehicles will be charged two thousand rupees
 abhi over speeding par chaar sau rupye dand kaa praavdhaan he
 On driving drunk, there will be a fine of ten thousand rupees, which is now two thousand rupees
 sharaab par jab do hazaar rupaya fine kiya gaya tha tab bhi wo rakam zyada thi lekin kya usase sharaab pikar gaadi chalaane main koi kami ai
 Is there sufficient number of traffic police forces and equipment in all cities from highways to enforce this law
 sarkarein haive par sharaab kii dukaane khol detii hai or sharaab pi kar gaadi chalaane par fine bhi badha detii he
 Shouldn't checking on the highway be done in the same way as in the cities of Delhi or Mumbai on the night of 31 December
 bharat main kai log laaparvaahee or dussahas ke kaaran helmet nahin pahante, magar zyaadaatar log badhiya quality kaa helmet nahin pahante hai
 It is seen worldwide that where there is poverty or there is more people from weaker sections
 vahaan log helmet pahanane se bachate hai
 That's why you see substandard helmets sold on the pavement across the country, which is the same as wearing or not wearing
 helmet na pahanane par pehle sau rupee kaa jurmaana tha jise ab 1000 rupaya kar diya jayega
 Not only this, the driving license for three months will be canceled
 badi sankhya main companiyaan delivery bvoy or girl ko bike detii hai
 Responsibility can also be imposed on such companies that they give the best helmet to their employees or else the penalty will be on them and not on the employee
 kya aisa praavdhaan ho saktaa tha
 Now if you are caught driving without a seat belt, then you have to pay a fine of one thousand rupees instead of hundred rupees
 yahi nahin ambulance, fire brigade kii gadiyon ko jagah na dene par das hazaar kii penlti lagegi
 If an ambulance is caught in a traffic jam, its responsibility will be on the car or jeep stuck in front of it or the traffic management administration
 das hazaar rupee kaa jurmaana kam nahin hota he
 By the way, people are now generally becoming sensitive to ambulances
 aglaa praavdhaan he 18 saal se kam umr kaa baccha gaadi lekar sadak par niklaa to maa-baap bhi zimmedaar honge
 Three years in jail and a fine of up to 25 thousand rupees
 gaadi kaa registration bhi radd kiya ja saktaa he
 If the traffic police does not listen, then a fine of two thousand rupees will have to be paid
 hamaare desh main skool vine main thuns thuns kar bacchon ko le jaaya jaataa he
 It not only compromises on security, but it is also related to the weak economic condition of our citizens
 ek gaadi main zyaada bachche isliye bithaane par majaboor hote hai kyonki isse unka kharchaa kam hota he
 The new provision may increase the burden on such sections
 lekin suraksha se bhi kaise samjhauta kiya jaae
 This is also a challenge
 yatri gadiyon kii overloding par prati atirikt yatri ek hazaar rupye kaa jurmaana lagegaa
 Overloading of two wheelers will attract a fine of Rs 2000 and the license will be canceled for three months
 abhi agar aap ek bike par teen yatriyon ko baithaate hai to sau rupye hi fine lagata he
 a provision has been made to increase the compensation from Rs 25,000 to Rs 2 lakh in cases of hit and run
 sadak durghatnaon main maut hone par 10 lakh rupye tak muaavze kaa praavdhaan
 The new amendment simplifies the process of claim and settlement of third party insurance
 kya vaaki logon ko das lakh kaa muawza miltaa he, kitnon ko miltaa he
 The intention of the government is right, it is the position of every economic section in the policies
 jurmaana badhaane se durghatana kam hoti he yaa sadakon par trephic police kii maujuudagi badhaane se
 There are about five thousand traffic policemen in Delhi itself whereas the requirement of 10 to 11 thousand traffic policemen is there
 2100 gadiyon par ek police vaala he
 Which is not enough
 agar dilli main hi paryaapt sankhya me trephic police bal nahin hai to baaki shaharon kaa kya haal hoga
 Are all those killed in road accidents killed due to careless driving
 may maheene main kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne haive sector ke hissedaaron ke saath ek meeting kii thi
 In it, he said that it is not always the driver's fault
 kai durghatnaon ke liye galat ejineering bhi zimmedaar hoti he
 In the meeting of the stakeholders of the highway sector in this May, Union Minister Gadkari had said, i am directing that the DPR of the roads on which there are frequent accidents, those who have made the project report, should also be accused
 main ise kanoon main laaungaa
 Has the Union Minister included it in his new law, because in this context, i would like to refer to an article of a decorated Cherian in the Hindu newspaper on Tuesday
 cherian seve live foundation ke nideshak hai
 In Bengaluru, a child died after falling from a motorcycle due to a road pit
 police ne neshnal haive athurity ke ejeeniyar ke kilaaf bhi maamla darj kar diya
 NHAI later cited section 28 of its law, stating that if its officer acted with good intentions then there could be no legal proceedings against him
 adhikari ke khilaaf maamla daayar nahin ho sakaa
 Will Gadkari end this exemption from NHAI
 kya unhone kharaab road ke kaaran ejiniyaron par maamla darj karne kaa praavdhaan darj kiya he, bahut dinon se sadak tuuti rahati he, durghatana hoti rahati he, kya iske liye sarkaar yaa mantri ko book kiya ja saktaa he, kya pataa usne hi sadak banane kii manzuri na di ho
 It is easy for the police to convict the driver
 kai baar wo bheed ke dabaav main kaam karti he, usase pehle bheed apana faisla kar leti he
 In this law, why is there nothing about such a crowd at the time of the accident, due to which people run away and the person who could have been saved dies
 yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki adhik fine se durghatnaayen kam hoti hai yaa nahin, shaayad hoti bhi hongi lekin iskaa ek aarthik paksh bhi he
 In September last year, when i did prime time on this issue, a story of America was told by quoting 'washington Post'
 phir sunaanaa chahta hum
 This story was written by Radley Balko blogging on Criminal Justice
 tippaniyan a 32-year-old black woman named Nicole Bolden was traveling in a car one day
 tabhi saamne vaali car ne galat tareeke se you-turn kiya or brake lagane ke baad bhi bolden kii car takaraa gai
 He had two young children in Bolden's car, but the one in the front car called the police and Bolden was arrested
 bolden ke khilaaf pehle se hi trephic niyamon ke ulanghan ke maamle main teen-teen warrant jari ho chuke the kyonki kamazor aarthik sthiti ke kaaran bolden jurmaana nahin bhar pai thi
 a lawyer has said that we call it Poverty Violation, that means people are not able to pay penalty due to poverty
 beemaa kaa premium nahin bhar paae to jurmaana, jurmaana nahin de paae to giraftaar kaa warrant
 Bolden somehow filled the amount of surety in one court but was arrested in another warrant
 aise logon kii madad karne vaale vakeelon kii sanstha ne jurmaana raashi ko 1700 amareeki dollar se kam karaane ke khub prayaas kiye
 1700 US dollars means fine of more than one lakh rupees in Indian rupees
 kisi tarah yah kam hokar 700 dollar hua yani 42 hazaar se kuch adhik
 During this time he had to stay in jail for more than 1 month
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki yah aparaadh nahin he
 It is a mistake
 'washington post' kii report kahati he ki badi sankhya main log vakil tak nahin rakh pate hai
 40 percent of St
 Louis County's earnings come from fines
 america main haalat ye ho gai he ki bel band bharwane ke liye companiyaan khul gai hai
 It has become a business
 zaruri nahin ki bharat main bhi aisa ho hi jaae lekin fine kii raashi adhik hone par duusari samasyaon ko darkinar nahin kar sakate

 a fine of ten thousand rupees is not reduced

 The next provision is that if a child under 18 years of age comes out on the road with a car, then the parents will also be responsible
 teen saal kii jail or 25 hazaar rupee tak kaa jurmaana
 Vehicle registration can also be canceled
 trephic police kii baat na maani to do hazaar rupee kaa jurmaana dena hoga

 Overloading of passenger trains will attract a fine of one thousand rupees per additional passenger
 towhilers kii overloding par 2000 rupye kaa jurmaana lagegaa or teen maheene ke liye license radd ho jayega
 Now if you seat three passengers on a bike, then only one hundred rupees is fine
 hit and ran ke maamalon main muaavze ko 25 hazaar rupye se badhaakar do lakh rupye karne kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya he
 Provision for compensation of up to Rs 10 lakh on death in road accidents
 nae sanshodhan main third party insurance ke clem or setlement kii prakriya ko aasaan bana diya gaya he
 Do people really get a compensation of one million, how many
 sarkaar kii niyat thik he, baat nitiyon main har aarthik tabake kii jagah kii he
 Increasing the penalty reduces the accident or increasing the presence of traffic police on the roads
 dilli main hi kareeb paanch hazaar trephic pulicekarmi hai jabaki zarurat he 10 se 11 hazaar trephic pulicekarmiyon kii
 There is a policeman on 2100 trains
 jo ki paryaapt nahin he
 If there is not enough traffic police force in Delhi itself, what will happen to other cities
 kya sadak durghatana main maare gaye sabhi log laaparvaah driving ke kaaran hi maare jate hai
 In May, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari held a meeting with stakeholders in the highway sector
 usamen unhone kaha tha ki hameshaa driver kii galati nahin hoti he
 Incorrect engineering is also responsible for many accidents
 isi may main haive sector ke hissedaaron kii baithak main kendriya mantri gadakari ne kaha tha, main nirdesh de rahaa hum ki jin sadakon par lagaataar durghatnaayen hoti hai, un sadakon kaa deepiar yani project report jin logon ne banaai he unhen bhi aaropee banaaya janaa chahie
 i will bring it into law
 kya kendriya mantri ne apane nae kanoon main ise shaamil kiya he, kyonki isi sandarbh main mangalvaar ko 'hindu' akhbaar main chape saji cherian ke ek lekh kaa zikr karnaa chaahunga
 Cherian is the director of the Save Live Foundation
 bengalooru main sadak ke gadde ke kaaran ek bachche kii motorcycle se gir kar maut ho gai
 The police also registered a case against the engineer of the National Highway Authority
 baad main enechaeai ne apane kanoon ke section 28 kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki agar uske adhikari ne acchhee niyat se kaam kiya he to uske kilaaf koi kanoonee kaarywahi nahin ho sakati he
 a case could not be filed against the officer
 kya gadakari enechaeai ko mili is chhot ko samaapt kar denge
 Have they registered a provision for registering a case against engineers due to a bad road, the road remains broken for a long time, accidents keep happening, can the government or minister be booked for this, does he know the road to be built Not approved police ke liye aasaan hota he, driver ko doshi bana dena
 Many times she works under the pressure of the crowd, before the crowd makes its decision
 is kanoon main durghatana ke vakt aisi bheed ke bare main kyon nahin kuch he, jiske dar se log bhaag jate hai or jisaki jaan batch sakati thi wo mar jaataa he
 It will also have to be seen whether more fine will reduce accidents or not, perhaps it will happen but it also has an economic side
 pichley saal sitambar main jab is masale par prime time kiya tha tab 'washington post' ke hawaale se america kii ek kahani sunai thi
 i want to hear it again
 yah kahani criminal justise par bloging karne vaale redley balko ne likhi thi
 The comments nichol bolden naam kii 32 saal kii ashwet mahila ek din car se kahin ja rahi thim
 Then the front car made a U-turn incorrectly and even after applying the brakes, Bolden's car collided
 bolden kii car main uske do chote bachche the lekin saamne kii car vaale ne police bulaai or bolden giraftaar ho gai
 Three warrants had already been issued against Bolden in violation of traffic rules as Bolden could not pay the fine due to weak economic conditions
 ek vakil ne bataaya he ki ise ham powarty vylation kehete hai yani garibi ke kaaran log jurmaana nahin de pate
 Failure to pay the premium for insurance, warrant for arrest if you fail to pay the fine
 bolden ne ek adaalat main kisi tarah zamaanat kii raashi to bhar di magar duusare warrant main giraftaar ho gai
 The organization of lawyers who helped such people made a lot of efforts to reduce the fine amount to less than US $ 1700
 1700 amareeki dollar matlab bhartiya rupee main ek lakh rupee se bhi adhik kii fine
 Somehow it was reduced to $ 700 i
e
 a little over 42 thousand
 is dauraan use 1 maheene se zyada jail main rahanaa padaa
 Lawyers say it is important to understand that this is not a crime
 galati he
 The Washington Post report says that a large number of people are not even able to hire a lawyer
 saint lui county kii kamai kaa 40 fisadi hissaa jurmaane se aata he
 The situation in America has become such that companies have opened up to get bail bonds filled
 baqayda ye bijness ho gaya he
 It is not necessary that this happens in India too, but if the amount of fine is high, we cannot ignore other problems
 kai jagahon par fine se sudhaar bhi aayaa he
 If the traffic police does not listen, then a fine of two thousand rupees will have to be paid
 hamaare desh main skool vine main thuns thuns kar bacchon ko le jaaya jaataa he
 It not only compromises on security, but it is also related to the weak economic condition of our citizens
 ek gaadi main zyaada bachche isliye bithaane par majaboor hote hai kyonki isse unka kharchaa kam hota he
 The new provision may increase the burden on such sections
 lekin suraksha se bhi kaise samjhauta kiya jaae
 This is also a challenge
 yatri gadiyon kii overloding par prati atirikt yatri ek hazaar rupye kaa jurmaana lagegaa
 Overloading of two wheelers will attract a fine of Rs 2000 and the license will be canceled for three months
 abhi agar aap ek bike par teen yatriyon ko baithaate hai to sau rupye hi fine lagata he
 a provision has been made to increase the compensation from Rs 25,000 to Rs 2 lakh in cases of hit and run
 sadak durghatnaon main maut hone par 10 lakh rupye tak muaavze kaa praavdhaan
 The new amendment simplifies the process of claim and settlement of third party insurance
 kya vaaki logon ko das lakh kaa muawza miltaa he, kitnon ko miltaa he
 The intention of the government is right, it is the position of every economic section in the policies
 jurmaana badhaane se durghatana kam hoti he yaa sadakon par trephic police kii maujuudagi badhaane se
 There are about five thousand traffic policemen in Delhi itself whereas the requirement of 10 to 11 thousand traffic policemen is there
 2100 gadiyon par ek police vaala he
 Which is not enough
 agar dilli main hi paryaapt sankhya me trephic police bal nahin hai to baaki shaharon kaa kya haal hoga
 Are all those killed in road accidents killed due to careless driving
 may maheene main kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne haive sector ke hissedaaron ke saath ek meeting kii thi
 In it, he said that it is not always the driver's fault
 kai durghatnaon ke liye galat ejineering bhi zimmedaar hoti he
 In the meeting of the stakeholders of the highway sector in this May, Union Minister Gadkari had said, i am directing that the DPR of the roads on which there are frequent accidents, those who have made the project report, should also be accused
 main ise kanoon main laaungaa
 Has the Union Minister included it in his new law, because in this context, i would like to refer to an article of a decorated Cherian in the Hindu newspaper on Tuesday
 cherian seve live foundation ke nideshak hai
 In Bengaluru, a child died after falling from a motorcycle due to a road pit
 police ne neshnal haive athurity ke ejeeniyar ke kilaaf bhi maamla darj kar diya
 NHAI later cited section 28 of its law, stating that if its officer acted with good intentions then there could be no legal proceedings against him
 adhikari ke khilaaf maamla daayar nahin ho sakaa
 Will Gadkari end this exemption from NHAI
 kya unhone kharaab road ke kaaran ejiniyaron par maamla darj karne kaa praavdhaan darj kiya he, bahut dinon se sadak tuuti rahati he, durghatana hoti rahati he, kya iske liye sarkaar yaa mantri ko book kiya ja saktaa he, kya pataa usne hi sadak banane kii manzuri na di ho
 It is easy for the police to convict the driver
 kai baar wo bheed ke dabaav main kaam karti he, usase pehle bheed apana faisla kar leti he
 In this law, why is there nothing about such a crowd at the time of the accident, due to which people run away and the person who could have been saved dies
 yah bhi dekhnaa hoga ki adhik fine se durghatnaayen kam hoti hai yaa nahin, shaayad hoti bhi hongi lekin iskaa ek aarthik paksh bhi he
 In September last year, when i did prime time on this issue, a story of America was told by quoting 'washington Post'
 phir sunaanaa chahta hum
 This story was written by Radley Balko blogging on Criminal Justice
 tippaniyan a 32-year-old black woman named Nicole Bolden was traveling in a car one day
 tabhi saamne vaali car ne galat tareeke se you-turn kiya or brake lagane ke baad bhi bolden kii car takaraa gai
 He had two young children in Bolden's car, but the one in the front car called the police and Bolden was arrested
 bolden ke khilaaf pehle se hi trephic niyamon ke ulanghan ke maamle main teen-teen warrant jari ho chuke the kyonki kamazor aarthik sthiti ke kaaran bolden jurmaana nahin bhar pai thi
 a lawyer has said that we call it Poverty Violation, that means people are not able to pay penalty due to poverty
 beemaa kaa premium nahin bhar paae to jurmaana, jurmaana nahin de paae to giraftaar kaa warrant
 Bolden somehow filled the amount of surety in one court but was arrested in another warrant
 aise logon kii madad karne vaale vakeelon kii sanstha ne jurmaana raashi ko 1700 amareeki dollar se kam karaane ke khub prayaas kiye
 1700 US dollars means fine of more than one lakh rupees in Indian rupees
 kisi tarah yah kam hokar 700 dollar hua yani 42 hazaar se kuch adhik
 During this time he had to stay in jail for more than 1 month
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki yah aparaadh nahin he
 It is a mistake
 'washington post' kii report kahati he ki badi sankhya main log vakil tak nahin rakh pate hai
 40 percent of St
 Louis County's earnings come from fines
 america main haalat ye ho gai he ki bel band bharwane ke liye companiyaan khul gai hai
 It has become a business
 zaruri nahin ki bharat main bhi aisa ho hi jaae lekin fine kii raashi adhik hone par duusari samasyaon ko darkinar nahin kar sakate
 In many places, there has also been improvement from fine
 yatri gadiyon kii overloding par prati atirikt yatri ek hazaar rupye kaa jurmaana lagegaa

 The Washington Post report says that a large number of people are not even able to hire a lawyer
 saint lui county kii kamai kaa 40 fisadi hissaa jurmaane se aata he
 The situation in America has become such that companies have opened up to get bail bonds filled
 baqayda ye bijness ho gaya he
 It is not necessary that this happens in India too, but if the amount of fine is high, we cannot ignore other problems

 a 32-year-old black woman named Nicole Bolden was traveling in a car one day
 tabhi saamne vaali car ne galat tareeke se you-turn kiya or brake lagane ke baad bhi bolden kii car takaraa gai
 He had two young children in Bolden's car, but the one in the front car called the police and Bolden was arrested
 bolden ke khilaaf pehle se hi trephic niyamon ke ulanghan ke maamle main teen-teen warrant jari ho chuke the kyonki kamazor aarthik sthiti ke kaaran bolden jurmaana nahin bhar pai thi
 a lawyer has said that we call it Poverty Violation, that means people are not able to pay penalty due to poverty
 beemaa kaa premium nahin bhar paae to jurmaana, jurmaana nahin de paae to giraftaar kaa warrant
 Bolden somehow filled the amount of surety in one court but was arrested in another warrant
 aise logon kii madad karne vaale vakeelon kii sanstha ne jurmaana raashi ko 1700 amareeki dollar se kam karaane ke khub prayaas kiye
 1700 US dollars means fine of more than one lakh rupees in Indian rupees
 kisi tarah yah kam hokar 700 dollar hua yani 42 hazaar se kuch adhik
 During this time he had to stay in jail for more than 1 month
 vakeelon kaa kahana he ki yah samajhnaa zaruri he ki yah aparaadh nahin he
 It is a mistake

" 'input: IANS Elections are in the head in Punjab and there are signs of a rift in the ruling Shiromani Akali dal-bjp alliance in the state
 punjab sarkaar ne 'soobe main vikaas ke nau saal' ko lekar ek bocolate jari kiya he lekin isamen na to bijepi or na hi party ke ek bhi netaa kaa zikr he
 It has been told through this booklet that CM Parkash Singh Badal and Deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal are the face of development in the state
 bocolate main andar ke ek panne main piem narendra modi kii teen choti-choti tasviren hai
 This booklet issued by the Government of Punjab details the development work done in the state
 siem or dipti siem ke alaava mantri sikandar singh maluka, kendriya mantri harsimrat cor badal or soobe ke rajasav mantri bikram majithia is bocolate main jagah banane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 The signs of breakdown of the alliance were found seven months ago
 In the last two consecutive months, the Akali dal-bjp coalition, which is in power, is not doing well, signs were started only in March
 us vakt rajya ke bijepi netaaon ke ek pratinidhimandal ne piem narendra modi se mulaakaat kii thi or gathbandhan tode jane kii maang kii thi
 BJP leaders said that the alliance with the Akali Dal was tarnishing the party's image
 haalanki is ghatana ke kareeb teen maheene baad yani june main bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh or punjab prabharee prabhaat jha ne gathbandhan tuutane kii atakalon par viraam laga diya tha
 Prabhat Jha had said that the Akali dal-bjp alliance would continue in Punjab
 or yah rishta tuutane vaala nahin he
 The alliance of the BJP and the Akali Dal is years old
 1998 main endie banane ke baad se hi akali dal iskaa hissaa rahaa
 The Akali Dal was also involved in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government at the Center
 centre kii maujuuda sarkaar main bhi akali dal kii hissedari he
 However, after the BJP got a thumping majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, its relationship with the Akali Dal started showing signs
 maharashtra, haryana, jhaarankhad main bana lee he duribijepi ne dhire-dhire apane kshetreey sahyogiyon se duuri banani shuru kar di
 This was also seen in the assembly elections held in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand
 jahaan tak punjab kaa sawaal he to yahaan satta congress or akali dal-bijepi gathjod ke bich baari-baari se aati rahi
 But in 2012 this trend was broken and the Akali dal-bjp alliance managed to return to power again
 lekin haal ke dinon main rajya main bijepi kii lokapriyata main giravat dekhne ko mili he
 In the last assembly election, BJP lost 7 seats and the party was reduced to 12 seats in the 117-member assembly
 pichley chunaav kii tulana main vot share bhi 8 fisadi kam rahaa
 Even bjp's vote share of 1 in 2014 general election
 7 gira or party 13 siton main mahaj do siten hi jeet saki
 Opportunity to control image damage, however, in the manner in which the Aam Aadmi Party is emerging in Punjab, it will not be so easy for the BJP to break the alliance with the Akali Dal
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ne chaar siten jeetin
 The party is also campaigning extensively for the assembly elections
 soobe main satta virdohi lahar he, aise main iskaa phayda congress ko miltaa he yaa aam aadmi party ko, yah aage saamne aayega
 But if the BJP breaks the alliance, then it can be of some benefit
 pichley do-chaar varshon ke dauraan punjab sarkaar kii kaaphi badanaami hui he
 Whether the issue of intoxication or the suicide of farmers, the state government's credibility has fallen
 satluj-yamuna link kanal ke masale par bhi punjab sarkaar kii kaaphi fajihat hui he
 If the BJP breaks away from the government before the elections, then at least it can go with the face of PM Modi among the people and control the damage with the help of his development works

 Therefore, on April 7, when the Union Cabinet approved the Real Estate (regulation and Development) Bill with changes, there was a light buzz from some parties but no one realized that there is such a political possibility in this issue

 develper kaa kahana he ki project main deree manzuri na milane ke kaaran hoti he jabaki kharidaar deree kaa mukhya kaaran ek project kaa paisa duusare main lagaana maanate hai
 Whatever it is, the plea to launch the project without approval is also not accepted

 phir bhi kya yah bill upabhoktaaon ke hiton kii raksha karata he? So when Rahul Gandhi decided to meet the Homebuyers Association of NCR, the newspapers wrote that after farmers, they are now adopting the issues of the middle class
 rahul gandhi ne congress mukhyalay main apane gharon ke liye gumnaam sangharsh kar rahe logon ko bulaayaa or unase samasya poochi
 By the way, many newspapers have been covering their issues
 aap jaanate hi hai ki upie ne 2007 se real estate bill par kaam shuru kiya tab jaakar 2013 main sansad main laa saki or uske baad bhi paas na ho sakaa
 Prior to this, Maharashtra Housing Act was introduced in Maharashtra in 2012
 2013 main centre sarkaar bhi apana ek bill lekar ai magar yah abhi tak kanoon nahin ban sakaa he
 After the demand of Samajwadi Party, Congress, Trinamool Congress and Left in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday, Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu said that they are talking to all parties
 venkaiya naidu ne kaha ki 13 may tak sadan faisla kar le ki ise salect cameti main bhejnaa he yaa nahin
 The Congress says that the NDA government has weakened their 2013 bill
 agar yah kanoon ban gaya to bilderon kii tuuti bolegi or karidaaron kaa haq maaraa jayega
 The 2013 bill said, in order to prevent the builder from leaving their first project in the balance, and for another project, 70 percent of the booking money will have to be invested in the same project
 2015 ke bill main 70 pratishat kii maatra ko ghataakar 50 pratishat kar diya gaya
 The developer says that the delay in the project is due to lack of approval while the buyers believe that the main reason for the delay is to invest the money of one project in another
 jo bhi he bina manzuri ke project launch karne kii daleel bhi kuch jamati nahin he
 Many projects also hang in the balance for this reason
 maujuuda sarkaar ne 2013 ke bill main ek baat yah jodi ki agar manzur plan main koi badali kerani he to builder ko do tihaai karidaaron se ijazat leni hogi
 It also included residential as well as commercial real estate which was not in the 2013 law
 is bill main praavdhaan he ki centre or rajya str par ek niamak athurity hogi jiskaa sankshipt naam rera he
 An institution will also be formed to appeal to him
 rera ke daftar main sabhi project kaa panjikaran karwaanaa hoga
 This registration can be done only after all the approvals, only then a builder can start booking the flat
 iske tahat builder ko sari jaankaree saarvajanik kerani hogi
 What is the plan of the project, when will the work start, what is the legal status of the land, from contractor to structural engineer, all such information will have to be provided on the website of the regulator
 agar koi bhi soochna galat di gai to jurmaane ke saath-saath builder ko teen saal kii jail ho jaaegi
 a broker selling or buying a project flat will also register with the regulator
 niamak ke pramukh ko zila jaj kaa darja hasil hoga or 60 dinon ke bheetar niamak ko faisla dena hoga
 States have to make their own rules within a year
 agar yah bill kanoon ban gaya to vaise project bhi iske daayre main aa jaaenge jo iske paas hone ke vakt puure nahin hue honge
 The regulator can also cancel a project
 agar samay par flats nahin mila to kharidaar byaaj ke saath apana paisa le saktaa he or yah byaaj 15 fisadi se zyada nahin hoga
 Now it is not clear that if someone asks, then the project owner should not take the money and throw it out
 daawa kiya gaya he ki yah bill kaale dhan ke aadan pradaan kii gunzaaish ko kam karata he par yah meri samaj main nahin aa sakaa ki kaise kam hoga
 You will remember the case of Mumbai's Campa Cola Society
 builder ne avaidh manzilen banaakar bech di
 Those who put their full earnings could not win in any court
 isi tarah ke maamle noida greater noida main khub hue hai
 The builders, after tying up with the authority officials, launched the project with approval
 yadav singh naam ke aise hi adhikari ke khilaaf gambhir jaanch chal rahi he
 The buyer is cheated on this day
 uske saath dhokhaa hota he
 There is one more problem
 flats mil jane ke baad sosayadi ke bheetar kiskaa niyantran ho ise lekar bhi lambii ladaai chalati rahati he
 There are reports of a fight between the developer and the RWA every day, whether the solution of this problem is in the new law is also a question
 maharashtra main bhi centre se pehle jo kanoon bana tha us par maine iconomic and political vikali main ek lekh padhaa jisamen bataaya gaya he ki nae kanoon ne upabhokta ke adhikaron ko or kamazor hi kiya he
 The comments pehle parking apartment kaa hissaa hota tha, 2012 ke kanoon main ise alag kar diya gaya
 You have to pay separate parking money
 upie ke banaae draft main kaward parking ko apartment kaa hissaa mana gaya he lekin khuli parking ko kaaman aria kaa hissaa
 So in this way all the nuances have to be understood
 kuch kaa kahana he ki paardarshita ke baavjood real estate main kaale dhan ke len dein par isse roak nahin lagati he
 Yet does this bill protect the interests of consumers? aap jaanate hi hai ki upie ne 2007 se real estate bill par kaam shuru kiya tab jaakar 2013 main sansad main laa saki or uske baad bhi paas na ho sakaa

 Today, on the occasion of India's 66th Republic Day, Rajpath is ready for a super guest
 raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii dinar party main bhi bandhaa samaa
 12:00 AM Happy 66th Republic Day to all baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar kii 127veen jayanti ke maukey par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne paswan jati ke liye bada elaan kiya
 Nitish Kumar said that the development schemes of the state government, which were being benefited only by the Mahadalits, will now benefit the Paswan caste as well
 nitish kumaar ne yah elaan kendriya mantri or lok janashakti party ke adhyaksh ram vilaas paswan dwaara patna main yojit bhimrao ambedkar jayanti ke maukey par kiya
 Significantly, till now all castes of Dalit community in Bihar were included in the Mahadalit class by Nitish Kumar
 in jatiyon ke liye alag se yojanaayen or vikaas ke kaary kiye ja rahe the
 For the past many years, Ram Vilas Paswan has been demanding that when the Nitish government has included all the castes of the Dalit community in the Mahadalit class, then why is the Paswan caste excluded from it? The answer is that until a few years ago, the paths of Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan were different and due to political reasons, the Nitish government kept the Paswan caste separate from the Mahadalit class
 magar ab jab donon detaa NDA main saath ho gaye hai to ramvilas paswan ne ek baar phir nitish kumaar se yah maang rakhi kipasswan jati ko mahadalit vargmen shaamil kiya janaa chahie or use bhi sabhi prakaar ke laabh milane chahie
 Accepting this demand of Ram Vilas Paswan, Nitish Kumar announced on Saturday that now the Paswan caste will also join the Mahadalit class and will also get the benefit of special government schemes being run for Mahadalits
 kaarykram ko sambodhit karte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha ki jo jatiyaan pichley kai varshon se haashiye par chali gai thim, unhen mukhyadhara main laane ke liye mahadalit varg kaa gathan kiya gaya tha
 Nearly 4% of Paswan Jatiko will get the benefit of this announcement by Nitish
 bataa den ki raajnneetik taur par nitish kumaar kaa yah faisla kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 In fact, amid the anti-dalit atmosphere against the BJP, Nitish Kumar wants to make his way easier in Bihar politics by helping a big Dalit leader like Ram Vilas Paswan
 nitish kumaar or ram vilaas paswan ke bich badhati kareebi se bihar bijepi netaaon main bechaini kii bhi atakalein hai
 There has been increasing pressure on the BJP due to speculation that a front could be formed between the two parties
 aise main nitish kumaar yah faisla in ashankaon ko or bal degaa
 The government has not yet taken any decision on the restructuring of the Planning Commission
 yojana or sankhyikee mantri raav indrajit singh ne yah jaankaree di
 Asked when the commission would be restructured, Singh said, "it is for the government to decide
" jab yah nirnay hoga, sarkaar isaki jaankaree degi
 With Singh's appointment as Planning Minister (independent charge), there was speculation that the government would not restructure the Planning Commission
 is bare main media khabaron par singh ne kaha, ‘mujhe bhi media se isaki jaankaree hui he
 i don't think it has any basis
 ’ mantri yahaan aathven rashtriya sankhyikee diwas par alag se baatcheet kar rahe the

 parichay jaanane ke liye google par search karne par kai pej khulte hai
 There is a lot of people on this internet
 isamen se kai log to america main bhi rahete hai
 But the first page that opens Wikipedia, its first line is something like this
 dow parth banerjee, maanavadhikaar kaaryakarta, lekhak, shikshak, media sameekshak or sangeetkaar
 Born and raised in Kolkata, now resides in New York and travels regularly to India
 iske baad unka ek lanbaa parichay he
 Partha Banerjee grew up in Kolkata
 pita jitendra nath banerjee rashtriya swayan sevak sangh ke jamini kaaryakarta the or uski raajnneetik shakha jansangh, jo ab bhartiya janata party ke rup main desh par shashan kar rahi he, se jude the
 Partha Banerjee got her first political education from her father
 baad main apane mamaa buddhadev bhattacharji ke prabhaav main vah congress kii taraf jhuke
 After completing his early college, he taught in a small balwai school in West Bengal for four years
 baad main saal 1985 main vah jaivik vigyaan main shodh ke liye america chale gaye
 While there, he earned his second degree in Plant Biology from Illinois State University

 After this he started working as a post doctoral research scientist in Albany
 saal 1999 main dow parth banerjee ne vigyaan kaa apana kariyar chhod diya or teesri master degree ke liye colombia uniwarsity ke graduate skool of jarnalism main daakhila le liya
 He was honored with the prestigious Seville Brown Award for his understanding of American media and ethics
 yaheen se vah scrips howard fellowship ke tahat anya saathi chaatro ke saath israel, philistin or jordan gaye, us ilaake main dharmik vyavhaar ke adhyayan ke liye

 unhone abisi, neuyork times, sienen, da progressive ke alaava bharat or bangladesh main bhi kai patrapatrikaon main likhaa
 His interview with Noam Chomsky was quite popular
 par mukhyadhara kii media main puunji ke badhate prabhaav va duniya bhar main visthapiton kii samasya ko dekhte hue vah adhyaapan gatividhiyon kii taraf mud gaye
 He later made his mark around the world as a science journalist, social writer aware, human rights activist, teacher, labor rights advocate and expert in displacement subjects
 vah angreji or bangala ke charchit lekhak hai
 His memoirs were printed in the bungalow under the name Ghotikahini
 rabindra sangeet par unka album bhi aa chukaa he
 Partha Banerjee had just come to Delhi recently, in connection with the release of her Bangla stories printed in English, 'music Box and Moonshine'
 is kitaab ko rubric publicing ne chapa he or isamen bankim chand chattopadhyaay se lekar sunil ganguli tak kul 18 sahityakaron kii kahaniyaan hai
 Sahitya Aaj Tak took an informal conversation with Partha Banerjee, taking advantage of this opportunity
 yah puche jane par ki vigyaan, udyog, shiksha or ab sahitya, aapane har samay jivan main alag-alag kshetra chune, koi vajah? parth banerjee kaa jawaab tha ki har umr va kshetra main seekhney ke kai maukey hai
 Multiple levels of comprehensive education in a way
 
 
 
 From my experiences, i advocate change in the current education system at all levels
 apane jivan se maine udhaaharan prastut karne kii ek koshish kii he
 Asked if you are an academician
 phir aapako sahitya se judane, vah bhi bangala kahaniyon kaa sankalan kar unke angreji anuwaad kii aavashyaktaa kyon mahasoos hui
 Any special reason for this? Partha Banerjee's quick answer was, as i call this work, the anti-imperialist cultural resistance movement
 agar mujhe hindi yaa tamil bhashaaon kii itani samaj hoti to main in bhashaaon main bhi yahi kaam karata
 On the question that this collection of your bungalow is now in English too, which author of the story of this collection 'music Box and Moonshine' did you like which story of your author more? Partha Banerjee's reply was, "so all stories have their own specialty, but Tagore's story 'one wife's letter', Vibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay's story 'pani ka ghat', Syed Muztaba Ali's story 'noon Pani' were the best
 
 "bengal ke apane anubhavon ke baad parth banerjee america ke apane anubhavon par bhi ek kitaab likh rahe hai
 He believes that climate change, indiscriminate earning and property inequalities are the biggest challenges before the world, which is too late to solve, yet if efforts are to save humanity and life then efforts should be made in this direction immediately

 If the solution is not found, then the world and human civilization cannot be saved from being destroyed

 There is an atmosphere of conflict between India and Canada due to the ongoing anti-india activities in Canada
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne shuukravaar ko canada ke pradhanmantri justin trudo ke saath hui mulaakaat ke dauraan is maamle ko gambhirtha se uthaaya tha
 Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh refused to meet Trudeau's visiting Canadian ministers, calling them Canadian supporters

 It has to be seen how successful they are in stopping anti-india activities in Canada
 dilli sarkaar or leftinent governor ke bich shuru hui jang par supreme court kii 5 jajon kii bench kaa faisla aa chukaa he
 In its judgment, the Supreme Court has made it very clear that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is bound to act with the help and advice of the Cabinet of the Government of Delhi in addition to the powers conferred under Section 239AA of the Constitution
 paanch jajon kii bench main shaamil chif justise deepak mishra ke alaava jaj eke sikri, eem khanvilakar, divai chandrachud or ashok bhushan shaamil hai
 Three judges gave their verdict on the dispute between the Delhi government and the lieutenant governor, while two judges AK Sikri and AM Khanwilkar did not give their verdict separately, agreeing with the decision of Chief Justice Deepak Mishra
 chif justise deepak mishra kaa faisla-court ko loktantric siddhanton par hi samvidhan kaa vyaakhyaan karnaa hoga
 All the three parts of the state are connected with the constitution
 lihaaja court kaa faisla samvidhan kii bhaavana par aadhaarit hona chahie
 The principle of collective responsibility is very important in the context of help and advice
 -kendra or rajya ko sangheey dhaanche kaa paalan karne kii jarurat he-shabdic vyakhaan se zyada ahm sandarbh vyaakhyaan he
 Delhi has a special place in the center-state relationship, the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi is not like the Governor of any other state
 -leftinent governor mantriparishad kii madad or salaah se bandhaa he
 However, he has the right to refer the matter to the President under Section 239AA of the Constitution
 leftinent governor swatantra rup se faisla nahin le saktaa or use mantri-parishad kii madad or salaah se hi faisla karne kii jarurat he
 -leftant Governor needs to work in harmony with the Council of Ministers
 -samvidhan ke mutabik mantriparishad ko apane faisle kii soochna leftinent governor ko deni he lekin iskaa yah matlab nahin ki mantriparishad leftinent governor ke adheen he
 Justice DY Chandrachud's decision - Constitutional quarrels test the resilience of democracy
 -samvidhan kii vyakhya sanvaidhanik naitikta par hi aadhaarit honi chahieise padhein: supreme court kaa aadesh modi sarkaar ke liye jhatka, kejariwal sarkaar kii badi jeet-janata kii samprabhutaa, shashan kaa loktantric tarika or dharmanirpekshata samvidhan kaa abhinn ang he
 The basic structure of the Constitution imposes certain restrictions on the powers of the constituents
 -madad or salaah kaa siddhant samuhik loktantr kii sanvaidhanik avadharana ko majboot karata he
 The real power and responsibility in democratic governance lies with the elected representatives
 -samvidhan kii dhara 239 ee kii vyaakhyaan main court ko loktantric bhaavana ko aage badhanaa he-samvidhan kii dhara 239 ee ke tahat 'koi mudda' koi tuchh mudda nahin ho saktaa
 Doing so will not be possible to govern — the lieutenant governor needs to understand that it is the responsibility of fundamental decisions, not the council itself
 -leftinent governor ko mantriparishad kii madad or salaah se kaam karnaa chahie yaa un maamalon main jahaan raashtrapati ke faisle se koi maamla raashtrapati ke liye sanderbhit he vah swatantra taur par faisla nahin le saktaa he
 Justice Ashok Bhushan's decision - The central government and the Delhi government have wide authority to enact laws on the capital Delhi region
 -samvidhan kii dhara 239 ee (4) ko chhodkar dilli ke leftinent governor ko mantriparishad kii madad or salaah par chalanaa hoga
 - The powers granted under Section 239AA of the Constitution can be decided only by the constitutional requirement if the Lieutenant Governor
 uttar pradesh main chunaav kii sugabugahat shuru hote hi ayodhya main ram mandir ke nirmaan ke daawey hone bhi shuru ho gaye hai
 BJP leaders are even claiming that the temple will be constructed by 2019
 vaise yah sambhav nahi dikhataa
 There may be delay in construction of Ram temple, former IPS officer Kishore Kunal, author of 'ayodhya Revisited', says that it is not possible from anywhere that the temple will be constructed by 2019
 unka kahana he ki abhi takasupreme courtmen is maamle par sunwaayee bhi shuru nahin hui he
 They do not think that in two or three years, the Supreme Court can complete the hearing and give a decision
 ayodhya rivigited ne khaarij kii puraani dharanaenlekhak ke taur par kishor kunal kaa maananaa he or unhone apni pustak main pramanit bhi kiya he ki ayodhya main ram mandir tha
 There is also the birthplace of Lord Rama
 apni kitaab 'ayodhya rivigited' main unhone kai puraani dharanaon ko galat sabit kiya he
 Babarjis Ram Janmabhoomi was not even going to Ayodhya
 It is talked about the construction of Parabari Majisdka, which has been rejected by Kishore Kunal on the basis of authenticity
 unka kahana he ki kathith babari masjid se babar kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin tha
 Babur never visited Ayodhya, neither broke a temple nor built a mosque
 babar ne nahin todaa tha koi mandilpani kitaab main kishor kunal ne babar ko is aarope se mukt kiya he ki usne koi mandir todaa he
 In his book, he described Babur as a generous emperor
 phir aakhir ram mandir ko kisne todaa or kab todaa gaya, iskaa jawaab bhi kitaab main he
 Kishore Kunal writes that during Aurangzeb's reign, the mosque was built by breaking the temple in 1660
 yahaan 1858 main hua tha pehla sampradayik dangakitab ne dastavej ke aadhaar par is baat ko siddh kiya he ki 1858 isvi tak us mandir main namaaj bhi padhi jaati thi or puja bhi kii jaati thi
 Communal riots occurred for the first time in 1855 AD
 uske baad ye afvaah failaai gai ki hanumangadhi main jo mandir he vah avadh nawabon ke samay main banaaya gaya tha
 a rumor was spread about him that this temple has been built over Alamgiri Mosque
 ayodhya hi he bhagwaan ram kii janmabhumikishor kunal ne kaha ki itihaas main pehali baar siddh kiya gaya ki vahi parram mandir tha or vahi sthaan janmabhumi he
 All these evidences have come after the Allahabad High Court verdict
 kitaab main jo kuch bhi likhaa gaya he wo sab pramanik taur par likhaa gaya he
 The Allahabad High Court's decision came in 2010, which has been challenged in the Supreme Court
 20 saalon se ayodhya par shodh kar rahe hai kunalkishor kunal kii maane to 20 varshon se wo ayodhya par shodh kar rahe hai
 They have some documents that only they have
 puri pustak dastavejon ke aadhaar par likhi gai he
 After the evidence on which the Allahabad High Court gave the verdict, in the last 6 years, a lot of new documents and strong evidence have been presented by Kishore Kunal through his book
 nishchit taur par supreme court main jab is maamle kii sunwaayee hogi to ye dastavej mukademe ko ahm mukaam dilaane main kaaphi madadgaar ho sakate hai
 Today, when watching TV, some such lines were bouncing that now the dishonest builders are not well
 ab nahin bachenge beyimaan builder
 These lines are an example of how TV creates a fake reality through words
 aap bilderon ke khilaaf raat din pradarshan kar rahe aam logon se puuchhiye ki kya vaaki ek may se rera kanoon lagu hone ke baad bilderon kii khayr nahin hogi
 Their dishonesty will end
 zaahir he tivi ko pataa he ki aapke paas vakt nahin he isliye usne kah diya ki beyimaan bilderon kii khayr nahin he
 However, he did not say that even after this law, nothing of the builders will deteriorate
 aisa is kanoon kii samiksha karne waalon ne kaha he
 TV hid the same thing from you that this law will not deter builders
 sirf ek naaraa de diya ki rera kanoon se bilderon kii khayr nahin
 Rera's full form is the Real Estate Regulation Bill 2013
 ise 14 agast 2013 ko awaas or shahari garibi unmoolan mantralay ne rajyasabha main pesh kiya tha
 The law passed in March 2016 and is now in force a year later from May 1
 is dauraan rajyon ne centre sarkaar ke banaae model par jo kanoon banaae hai unke bare main koi acchhee report to nahin
 In many states, such scope has been left that the builders survive
 lekin media ne badi chaalaaki se ye jumala aapako pakadaa diya ki ab bilderon kii kair nahin
 Whatever residential project will come up with a few exceptions, it will have to be registered with RERA
 kuch apwaadon se bilderon ko kya kya laabh ho jayega, ise samajhnaa hoga
 Without registering, no promoter will be able to take advance amount or make booking
 yahaan tak ki flats kii kharid bikri karaane vaale agent ko bhi rera main register karana hoga
 All the information of any project will be on rera's website, it will have written the site, layout and when the project is completed
 karidaaron se jo bhi paisa liya jayega uskaa 70 fisadi hissaa ek alag bank khate main jamaa hoga
 State governments have been given exemption that less than 70 percent can be kept in separate account
 yah chhot rajya sarkaron ko kyon di gai he, bilderon ko laabh pahunchane ke liye yaa kharidaaron ko
 This will be known only when you learn how to watch TV builders and not go out of the jumal
 real estate regulation bill main ek tribunel banane kii baat he
 Every state will establish it on its own
 agar rera ne kharidaaron ke haq main faisla nahin diya yaa builder rera kaa nirnay se santusht nahin hua to is tribunel main apil kii ja sakegi
 RERA has a provision that if the applicant does not get any response from RERA within 15 days of the application for registration, the project will be treated as registered
 tippaniyan Each state will have one RERA, one chairperson and two members
 itani choti sanstha kya 15 dinon main bilderon ke pesh kiye gaye le out plan, unki manzuri vagairah kii jaanch kar register kar sakati he
 Under this law, negligence of development authorities can also be overcome
 rera ke tahat jurmaane kaa bhi praavdhaan he
 If the promoter does not register the property, he will be fined ten percent of the total cost of the project
 agar rera ke adeshon ke baavjood bhi panjikaran nahin kara sakaa to teen varsh tak jail ho sakati he yaa anumaanit laagat kaa das fisadi tak atirikt jurmaana liya ja saktaa he
 76,000 real estate companies will register under RERA
 ek anumaan ke anusaar bharat main har saal 2300 se 4488 project laanch hote hai
 One million buyers invest in these projects
 jo project pehle se chal rahe hai unhen bhi rera se panjikaran lenaa hoga
 It is important to understand this law
 lakhon log bilderon se pareshaan hai
 If someone did not get a flat in time, someone got a bad flat
 hamen jaananaa chahie ki rera ke astitv main aane se puraani takalif kitni dur hogi or nayaa anubhav kitna shandaar hoga
 Will RERA also answer quality and design questions? rera kaa phul farm he real estate regulation bill 2013
 It was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 14 August 2013 by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation
 march 2016 main yah kanoon paas hua or ab ek saal baad ek may se lagu ho rahaa he
 During this period, there is no good report about the laws made by the states on the model of the central government
 kai rajyon main aisi gunzaaish chodi gai he ki builder batch jaaen
 But the media cleverly caught this jumla that you are no longer the builders
 kuch apwaadon ko chhod kar jo bhi awasaiya pariyojna aegi use rera se register karana hoga
 With a few exceptions, builders will have to understand what will happen
 bina register karaae koi bhi pramotor na to agrim raashi le sakegaa na hi booking kar sakegaa
 Even the agent selling the purchase of the flat will have to register in RERA
 kisi bhi project kii sari jaankaree rera kii website par hogi, isamen site, le out or project kab puraa hoga sab likhaa hoga
 70% of whatever money will be taken from buyers will be deposited in a separate bank account
 rajya sarkaron ko chhot di gai he ki 70 fisadi se kam bhi alag khate main rakh sakate hai
 Why this exemption has been given to the state governments, to benefit the builders or to the buyers
 yah tabhi pataa chalegaa jab aap tivi bilderon kii khayr nahin jaise jumalon se nikal kar dekhnaa seekhenge
 There is talk of creating a tribunal in the Real Estate Regulation Bill
 ise har rajya apane apane yahaan sthapit karegaa
 If RERA has not given a decision in favor of the buyers or the builder is not satisfied with the decision of RERA, an appeal can be made in this tribunal
 rera kaa ek praavdhaan he ki agar aavedankarta ko panjikaran ke liye aavedan ke 15 dinon ke andar rera se koi jawaab na mili to pariyojna ko panjikrut maan liya jayega
 The comments har rajya main ek rera hoga, jiskaa ek cheirperson hoga or do sadsy honge
 Whether such a small organization can register in 15 days by checking the layout plan, approval of the builders, etc
 is kanoon ke tahat vikaas praadhikaranon se hui laaparvaahee ko bhi saadhaa ja saktaa he
 There is also a provision for penalty under RERA
 agar pramotor ne sapantti kaa panjikaran nahin karaayaa to us par pariyojna kii kul laagat kaa das pratishat jurmaana lagegaa
 If not registered despite rera's orders, he could be jailed for three years or an additional fine of up to 10% of the estimated cost
 76,000 real estate companiyaan rera ke tahat register hongi
 According to an estimate, 2300 to 4488 projects are launched in India every year
 das lakh kharidaar in project main nivesh karte hai
 Projects which are already underway will also have to get registration from RERA
 is kanoon ko samajhnaa zaruri he
 Millions of people are upset with the builders
 kisi ko samay se flats nahin mila to kisi ko kharaab flats mila
 We should know how far the old suffering will come from the existence of RERA and how great the new experience will be
 kya quality or dizine ke sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi rera se milegaa
 Whatever residential project will come up with a few exceptions, it will have to be registered with RERA
 kuch apwaadon se bilderon ko kya kya laabh ho jayega, ise samajhnaa hoga
 Without registering, no promoter will be able to take advance amount or make booking
 yahaan tak ki flats kii kharid bikri karaane vaale agent ko bhi rera main register karana hoga
 All the information of any project will be on rera's website, it will have written the site, layout and when the project is completed
 karidaaron se jo bhi paisa liya jayega uskaa 70 fisadi hissaa ek alag bank khate main jamaa hoga
