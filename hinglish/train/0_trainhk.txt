 Even though the Coast Guard has foiled the Pasakistani Botaki intrusion of Porbandar into the Arabian Sea, there are many questions that have not been answered yet
 inamen sabase ahm sawaal yah he ki boat par savaar chaar logon kaa kya hua? coast guard headquarter kii ore se di gai jaankaree main kharaab mausam ko iske liye jimmedaar tehraaya gaya he, lekin mahatvapurn baat yah he ki jab intelegence input samay se mil gaya tha to un chaar logon ko pakadaa kyon nahin ja sakaa? aise kai or sawaal hai, jinke jawaab milane abhi baaki hai
 1- On the night of 31 December, four people were seen on the boat which had entered the Indian maritime border from Katie port of Karachi
 coast guard kii ore se di gai jaankaree ke mutabik ve chaaron aag main jaale nahin, pani main kud gaye the
 In such a situation, the big question arises as to why none of these were caught? 2-coast Guard IG Kuldeep Singh Shevran said in a press conference on Saturday that the boat which came from Pakistan in the Arabian Sea was exploded
 , Two people aboard it were killed
 lekin do log life jacket pahanakar samandar main kud gaye or bhaagane main kaamyaab rahe
 They told that the four people in the boat were wearing jeans and T-shirts
 ve machuaare nahin the to ve koun the or kahaan gaye?3 -pehali boat main dhamaakaa hone ke baad 31 disbanr kii subah 5 baje duusari boat se ek sandesh record kiya tha, jisamen kaha gaya ki is boat ne apana kaam kar diya
 Now the question is, in spite of such promptness of the Coast Guard, which boat was successful in its plan? 4- It was heard in the record message from the boat that it has been 'consigned', but the boat got pierced and hence it was returned Have to run
 hairat kii baat yah he ki sandesh record hone ke baad bhi boat pakistani seemaa main waapas pahunchane main kaamyaab rahi
 The record of the conversation between two fishing boats coming from Karachi towards Porbandar at 9 am on December 5-31 shows that the boat was in constant contact with the Pakistan Maritime Agency and the Pakistan Army
 is boat se lagaataar karachi or thailand main baat chal rahi he, lekin itnaa input hone ke baad bhi in donon boat kaa kya hua, iskaa kuch pataa nahin chalaa he

 But what they have done now has left behind all the brutality
 kyonki ye khauf kii vah tasviir he jo kisi ko bhi dahala kar rakh de
 This time everything has happened in the middle of a city intersection
 sunsaan registani thikaanon main apane bandhakon kaa sir kalam karanevaale iesas ne is baar in gumnaam thikaanon ne nikal kar bich shahar main kuch logon ko aisi bhayanak maut di he ki jinhen dekh kar kisi ke bhi rongte khadey ho jaaen
 ISIS has released a video in which he is seen beheading three people in the middle of an Iraqi city
 iesas ke kabze vaale is iraqi shahar main na sirf aatankwaadiyon ne teen logon kaa sir saream kaat diya, balki bich shahar main hazaron logon kii bheed shor machaati or taaliyaan bajaati huin ye sara manzar dekhati rahi
 Seeing these pictures released by ISIS, any person will be shaken to the inside
 uski ruh kaanp jaaegi
 But what to do? Despite the strict opposition of all the countries including America, all these things are not only happening in Iraq, but are constantly increasing
 pehle mike se kii gai munadb aaie aapako is barbar harakat kii puri kahani tafasil se bataae dete hai
 Suddenly one afternoon in a small town in northern Iraq, ISIS militants capture three people and bring them to a crossroads
 unke haath peeche bandhe hai, jabaki teenon ke sir or ankhen nakaab se dhanki hai
 Now the trio are seated one by one on the empty space between the intersections and then an old ISIS militant turns into a terrorist with a mike in his hand
 wo pehle logon ko awaz lagaakar ye manzar dekhne ke liye bulaata he or phir ek-ek kar teenon ke gunahon se unhen vaakif karwaata he
 Except this old terrorist at this crossroads, the faces of all the ISIS terrorists are adorned
 do kaa aparaadh samalangikta, ek kaa ish nindaaye aatankwaadi bataata he ki kis tarah in teen main se do ne ek-duusare ke saath najayas jismani tallukaat banaae
 That is, he committed a 'terrible crime' of homosexuality
 jabaki tisare shaks ne uuparavaale or islam ke bare main aapattijanak baaten kahin
 After this, the terrorist, who is on hand, will also punish the three and tells that now their necks will be blown in one stroke
 ye sunakar kuch der kar liye har koi thithak jaataa he
 But the terrorists finally do what they want
 ek lanbaa-chaudaa aatankwaadi apane haath main ek badi si zang lagi talwaar lekar unki taraf badhata he or phir ek-ek kar ghutane ko bal baithe in teenon bandiyon kaa sir ek hi jatke main dhad se alag kar detaa he
 However, this is not the first case of killing gay people in public
 isse pehle bhi kai logon ko iesas ke aatankwaadi shahar kii oonchi imaaraton main le jaakar upar se dhakka de kar neeche gira chuke hai
 But this time the way the heads of three people have been beheaded with sword after summoning people after making money on Mike is really strange, terrible and shocking

 And the reason for this was Salman was due to slapping Birko

 isliye agar aap dizin ke liye iphone XR kharid rahe hai to aapako paas iphone x kaa opshan he

 Less than a month is left for the ICC Cricket World Cup to begin
 team india kii ranneeti ko lekar bhi khulkar charchaa kii ja rahi he
 Former Team India captain Rahul Dravid believes that the success of Team India to a great extent in the World Cup depends on Virat Kohli
 lekin worldcup se pehle philhal team india ke saamne tri siries ke final main pahunchane ke liye australia main jeet kaa khaataa kholane kii jarurat he
 Many experts are openly saying that the most important role in captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni's World Cup campaign and his strategy will be Test captain Virat Kohli
 lekin, purv captain rahul dravid or duusare kai jaankaar yah bhi maanate hai ki bhartiya team batting par bahut zyada nirbhar karti he
 Dravid says that Virat Kohli will have to bat well and set the tempo of the match from where players like Dhoni or Raina can play the role of match finishers
 purv dakshin africa captain grem smith kehete hai ki viraat kohli spin or pes donon ko hi khilne kaa acha hunar rakhte hai
 Smith says that if Kohli gets set on the pitch, it can prove dangerous for any team
 vah kehete hai ki unka canavarzan rate shandaar he, jo unhen or bhi khatarnaak bana detaa he
 Virat Kohli has 21 centuries and 33 half-century innings in 148 odis
 yani half centuri ke score par pahunchate hi kohli ke shatak banane kii sambhaavnaaen bad jaati hai
 Dravid also says that after a poor performance in Tests, the graph of Team India has actually been spectacular in odis
 isliye vanade main team india kii ranking number do he
 He also says that although there are many players in the team, who are going to play World Cup for the first time, the players have a good experience of playing odis
 haalanki 26 saal ke kohli worldcup kaa khitaab apane naam kar chuke hai
 But Kohli's talent has grown after the 2011 World Cup
 2011 worldcup tak viraat kohli ne 54 vanade match khele the, jisamen unhone 5 shatak lagaae the
 He has played 94 odis since the 2011 World Cup, in which he has played 16 century innings
 yani kohli pehle se kareeb doguni raftaar se shatak banane lage hai
 For the time being, Kohli needs to lead Team India to the final of the World Cup's Dress Rehearsal ie Carlton Mid Tri Series
 tri siries ke pehle do maichon main unhone kul 13 ran banaae hai or team india tri siries ke pehle do match ganvaa chuki he
 Kohli's test with Team India has become difficult

 iske baad coach ko phone kiya, to unhone kol risive nahin kii
 An attempt was made to speak in the DG office as well, so the officer did not respond, citing reasons of busyness there
 santosh ne kaha, 'maine iske baad bhartiya khel praadhikaran (sai) aurkhel mantralayamen shikaayat darj karai, lekin koi phayda nahin hua, balki bina jaanche parakhe mujhe ek chitthee thama di gai
 In which it is written that he can no longer practice in the stadium

 Kerala is as dear to me as Varanasi
 kerala ke guuruvayur main bijepi kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav main mila prachand janadesh new india ke nirmaan ke liye he
 Why did the account not open where modipm Narendra Modi said that political parties and people conducting elections could not understand the mood of the people
 lekin logon ne bijepi ko majboot janadesh diya
 On making Kerala the first stop of his tour, Narendra Modi said that some people are surprised why Narendra Modi is coming to Kerala in South where bjp's account is not even open
 unhone aage kaha ki bharat ke loktantr main chunaav kaa apana sthaan hota he, or jeetne vaale kaa ye daayitv he ki vah puure 130 karod logon ke hiton kaa khyaal rakhe
 Modi said, "those who win us are also ours, those who have missed us this time are also ours, for me Kerala is as dear as Varanasi
 "varanasi piem modi kaa sansadeey kshetra or bijepi kaa majboot kila rahaa he

 Let us know that the politics of West Bengal was too far away for BJP about 10 years ago, but working on a long plan, BJP has registered a strong presence there by winning 18 seats this time
 kerala jaisaa pashchim bengal main bhi kabhi left or congress kaa dabadabaa tha, lekin yahaan par vam or congress haashiye par chale gaye or inaki raajnneetik spes par bijepi ne apana jhanda fahraaya
 However, both the Congress and the Left are in a strong position in Kerala at this time and the BJP will have to work hard to make its place
 kerala main flop rahi he bijepibataa den ki kerala kii 20 loksabhaa siton main bijepi ko karaari haar jhelni padi he
 The Congress has won 19 seats here
 jabaki ek seat par sipiem ke ummidavaar ko jeet mili he
 More than one-third of the 52 seats won by the Congress in this Lok Sabha election have come from Kerala
 is lihaaj se kerala desh main congress ko sabase majboot garh bana hua he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has also won from Wayanad in Kerala
 kerala kaa janadesh is lihaaj se bhi piem narendra modi ke liye chunauteepurn he, kyonki yaheen kaa wo matadaata he jis par modi lahar kaa asar nahin hua he
 Apart from this, bjp's presence in the 2016 Kerala assembly elections has been negligible
 140 sadasyon vaali kerala vidhansabha main bijepi kaa ek maatr vidhayak he
 Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are states where the BJP is weak in the fort of the south

 new Delhi
 amrapali group par ek baar 2010 main iskar chapa padaa or tab samooh ne 1
 39 crore was surrendered in cash, while in the Income Tax raid of 7 August 2013, the company surrendered income of Rs 125 crore, ie the company failed to give any account of it
 2013-14 ke auditid financial statement main kisi atirikt aay kaa zikr nahin he
 These startling facts have come up in the forensic audit of the company under the supervision of the Supreme Court
 pichley dinon aae supreme court ke faisle main is report kaa zikr he
 The forensic audit team has clearly stated that the Amrapali Group has taken these unaccounted cash either from home buyers or in cash as a return from various companies through bogus purchases
 company lagaataar flats kharidaaron se nagdi leti rahi lekin uski entry account book main nahin kii gai
 It was also not clear in the audit that the surrender of the company was Rs 125 crore
 iskar vibhaag ne kis tarah sweekaar kiye jabaki 2013-14 ke dauraan company ne koi atirikt aay khate-bahi main dikhaai nahin he
 Obviously the scam was prolonged
 yahi nahin forencik audit report main kaha gaya he ki iskar vibhaag ne notebandi ke baad 17 november 2016 ko company kaa iskar survey hua jisamen adhikari cash or diarectaron kaa bayaan lekar gaye
 But the forensic audit team has not been informed yet
 amrapali kii companiyon par iskar vibhaag ne 9 sitambar 2010 or 7 agast 2013 ko chapa maaraa or talaashi lee
 The Income Tax Department found that the company has provided only the details of the purchase of the goods from the bogus suppliers while no material was purchased
 ye farji billing 842 karod rupye se bhi zyada kii thi
 In order to ascertain the veracity of the suppliers, the investigating officers sent a letter to their address from the speed post but most of the letters came back with the reply, "no firm by this name exists at this address"
 canodia cements naamak ek saplir se amrapali ne bajri va cement kii kharid 14 farvari 2015 se lekar 2 march 2015 tak kii gai dikhaai he
 Surprisingly, 30 tons of gravel trucks entered Amrapali's premises 19 times during this period and came out after dropping the gravel within five minutes
 kuchhek maamalon main to 2 minute main hi trek waapas aa gaya
 These timings are recorded by the company in its challan
 is saplir se 11
 69 Karo was purchased
 jaahir he farjivada kiya ja rahaa ho to sab kuch mumkin he
 The company has made tremendous manipulations in accounting
 company ne acounting kii paddatiyon or software main badlaav kiye taaki agenciyon kii ankhon main dhul jhonki ja sake
 The forensic audit revealed that the company had done accounting on Tally Software till March 2015, but brought Far Vision after that which was not implemented properly
 november 2016 main group ne for vijan ko bhi bich main chhod diya or kuch accounting dobaaraa teli main shuru kar di
 The promoters, cfos and officers of the group recorded the details of transactions in the tally and some time in the forefront so that the fudge is not caught
 ye sajeesh kaa hissaa tha or iske baad company ne register of companyj or iskar vibhaag main ritern daakhil karnaa band kar diya

 If Owaisi puts up candidates in this Muslim-dominated area, then Lalu Nitish's vote bank is sure to be breached

 'one and a half lakh people were stranded in about 300 km of hilly areas
 na khaanaa, na pani, na sir par chat, na zamin kii god, na raste or na manzil par pahunchane kii ummiden
 The mishap that took place from the sky was taking 1
5 lakh people closer to death every moment
 par tabhi usee aasmaan se zindagi ai or ek-ek zindagi ko bachaakar le gai
 Such uncontrollable and murderous waves of angry friends of Alaknanda arose that whoever came in their way, either swept it or threw it so far that it was difficult for them to come back to their world, because they had to reach their world All the ground routes had separated themselves from their destination
 kareeb 300 kilometre ke daayre main pahadiyon ke upar-neeche ufanti nadiyon ke ird-gird or dur-daraaj jangalon main dedh lakh se zyada log fanse the
 Now his life was completely on mercy, with the help of the same sky, from which the cloud of trouble had burst on his head
 iske saath hi shuru hua uttarakhand main sadi kaa sabase bada oparation
 Operation to bring one and a half million people back to their world
 aasamaani tevar ab bhi kade the
 The gathering of clouds was still there
 mausam ab bhi badmijaaz tha or neeche zamin jahaan-tahaan nadaarad
 Difficult to fly, dangerous to land
 par sawaal dedh lakh zindagiyon kaa tha
 Therefore, by ignoring both the sky and the land, the air helpers decided to risk their lives by risking their lives
 sena, vayusena, sarkari or gaiyr sarkari milakar 60 choper dehradun pahunchaa
 Apart from all the three parts of the army, about 15,000 personnel of ITBP and BRO had come back
 sabase mushkil rescue oparation kii ruparekha taiyaar ho chuki thi
 It was decided that where there would be even a slight scope, the chopper would land and save the trapped people
 iske saath hi dehradun ke jolly grant airport or gochar ke army base par choper qatari se khadey kiye gaye
 All the choppers were to fly and land from these two places
 par mushkil ye thi ki shuruyaat main yah pataa hi nahin chal rahaa tha ki log kahaan-kahaan fanse hai? kin-kin ilaako main madad kii jarurat he
 So, apart from gathering information from other places, the first few flights flew just to find out just that
 pehali kuch udaanon se kaaphi kuch saaf ho gaya ki kahaan-kahaan sabase zyada haalat kharaab hai or kahaan-kahaan fori madad kii jarurat he
 Photos were in front
 target kaa pataa chal chukaa tha
 So now each chopper is given different targets and with this the first flight of the sky helper fills the guard
 der se hua tabaahi kaa andajasarkaar der se jaagi
 The devastation and devastation was delayed
 isi deree ke chalate pahaado main aasamaani raahat ko bhi pahunchane main der lagi
 But once they reached there, it started at the same time, the country's largest rescue operation in recent years
 dedh lakh logon ko dhundhakar unhen maut ke munh se nikaalnaa border par kisi taqatvar dushman se jang jeetne se kam nahin he
 MI 17 is ready to fly from the Army's temporary airbase ie Gochar to Guptkashi in Uttarakhand
 helicopter main is vakt kuch faujee afasar or jawan khaane-pine kii chizon or dawaaion ke saath udaan bharne ja rahe hai, taaki pahaado par fanse logon ko nikaalane ke saath-saath vahaan maujuud duusare logon tak buniyadi zarurat kii ye chizein vakt par pahunchaai ja saken
 Preparations have been completed
 lihaaza, payalat apni kursi sambhaal lete hai or phir agle chand second main helicopter hawa se baaten karne lagata he
 Amidst the bad weather and the dangers of rain, this helicopter reaches Guptkashi after completing an air journey of about 20 miles
 kedarnath se 22 kilometre dur is jagah par ab bhi hazaron aise log maujuud hai, jinhen sena kii madad kii darkaar he, taaki wo yahaan se nikal mahafooz thikaanon tak pahunch saken
 But an MI17 helicopter cannot airlift so many people at once
 lihaaza, pehle se guptkashi main maujuud faujee ab ek-ek kar logon ko yahaan se nikaalane kii taiyaari shuru kar dete hai
 After this, through air-dropping, the needy people are transported to the trapped people, then one by one people are brought towards the helicopter
 army ne iske liye token kaa bhi intazaam kiya he, taaki buudhe, biimaar, mahilaon or bacchon ko tavajjo di ja sake
 Now one by one from the line, people are given place in the helicopter
 chunki emai 17 duniya ke sabase bade helicopteron main se ek he, isamen 5 kru member or fauziyon ke alaava kul 14 logon ko lift kiya jaataa he, phir ye helicopter ek baar phir apane thikaane yani gochar ke liye ravaanaa ho jate hai
 The helicopter reaches the airbase of the transit after a journey of about 20 minutes
 fuj ke tamaam jambaazon ke liye ye bhale unki eksrasise kaa ek hissaa ho, lekin is helicopter main savaar hokar yahaan tak pahunche in logon ke liye ye zindagi kii udaan he
 Therefore, after the completion of this flight, a streak of success and relief can be seen on the face of every person who arrived here
 kai log yahaan apano se lipat kar rone lagate hai or phir yahaan se aage apane-apane gharon ke liye unka safar shuru ho jaataa he
 But on the other side, another helicopter takes off on another flight of life at the same airbase
 pichley das dinon se bhi zyaada kaa vaqt is baat kaa gavaah he ki jab-jab in helicopteron ne udaan bhari, anginat tuutati saanson kii door phir se judi hai
 Be it the world's largest Mi 17 and Mi 26 helicopters or the medium or lightweight chopper
 barish or dhundh kii chaadaron ke baavjood aasmaan main in helicopteron kii har udaan ke saath kudarat kii maar jhel rahe insaanon kii ummid ne bhi nai udaan lee he
 In this operation, two helicopters of Indian Army and Airforce proved to be most effective
 20 se zyaada emai-17 or emai-26 helicopteron ne ye dikhaa diya ki kis tarah zarurat padane par phogiyon ko jang ke maidan tak pahunchaanevaale ye mashin insaan kii zindagi bachaane ke kaam aa sakate hai
 This is not the case of big machines i
e
 big helicopters, even in places on the mountains, where the sky is too small for the wings of such large helicopters
 aisi hi jagahon ke liye airforce ne 16 advanced lite helicopteron kaa intazaam kiya tha, jo zindagi or maut kii is ladaai main turup kaa ikkaa sabit hue
 The army kept Gochar as its base camp for this operation, while the rest of the government and non-government light helicopters were flying from Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun
 inhen jagahon se har rose helicopteron ne badrinaath, kedarnath, guptkashi, uttarkashi, harsil or dharasu jaise thikaanon ke liye udaan bhari or ek-ek kar pahaado main fanse logon ko nikaal liya
 But look at the nature of nature
 ek vakt aisa bhi aayaa, jab dusron ko bachaate-bachaate mangalvaar ko 20 javaanon ne maut ko gale laga liya
 The Air Force helicopter crashed in Gaurikund and all the soldiers on board were killed
 sainikon kii ye shahadat seemaa par jang main jaan dene se kam nahin thi
 No matter how high the helicopters are, the landing was on the ground
 phir jab zamin par raahat or bachaav kaa silsilaa shuru hua, to phir fuj kii jambaaji kii ek nai daastaan puri ho gai
 Somewhere stranded in the mountains, thousands of people trapped in the trenches were evacuated
 do pahaado ke bich ufanati nadi kii dhar or upar sirf ek rassi ke sahare zindagi kaa jang jeetne kii koshish kaamyaab rahi
 The sight of people rescuing people from above the Mandakini river near the Badrinath temple creates a wrinkle in the body
 lekin sena ne isi tarah se ek nahin, do nahin, balki hazaron logon kii jaan bachaa lee
 a man working at the NFC Campus in Hyderabad committed suicide with his wife
 police ko praathmik jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki is kadam ke peeche paariwarik vivaad he
 No suicide note has been found from the scene
 maamla darj kar liya gaya he
 According to the information, a 29-year-old man committed suicide by hanging himself with his wife in the quarters at DAE Colony
 enegsi main taknishyan divakar or uski patni himani devi ko mangalvaar kii subah apane ghar ke pankhe se lataka paaya gaya
 Police officer-in-charge n Venkata Ramanna said that there was a family dispute between the couple who committed suicide for a long time
 somvaar kii raat donon ke bich kaaphi jhagada hua tha
 On the night itself, both of them caught hanging from the fan
 mangalvaar kii subah ghatana kaa pataa chalaa he
 Haji Mahboob, the main Muslim party in the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid land dispute case, has given a big statement
 unhone kaha ki agar pradhanmantri narendra modi ke str par madhyasthata kii jaae, to ram mandir vivaad kaa samaadhaan adaalat ke baahar ek ghante main nikal jayega
 During this, he also expressed disappointment over the continued hearing of the case in the Supreme Court
 unhone daawa kiya ki unke paas is vivaad ke hal kaa sateek formula he
 There is no objection to the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, but it will be done only when there is an initiative at the Prime Minister's level
 ajtak se khaas baatcheet main haji mehboob ne kaha, 'supreme court main roj-roj taarikh badhane se niraashaa bad rahi he
 The top court should think seriously about this
 yah vivaad hindu or musalamaanon ke bich khai badhaata ja rahaa he
 In this case, this matter should be dealt with as soon as possible
 ' unhone kaha ki agar sarkaar chaahe, to is vivaad kaa samaadhaan adaalat ke baahar bhi nikal saktaa he
 If this entire matter is mediated at the level of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the saints and the parties of the case are seated face to face, then the dispute will be resolved in an hour
 is dauraan haji mehboob ne aarope lagaaya ki vishwa hindu parishad or kai muslim sanghathan nahin chaahate hai ki is vivaad kaa hal nikle
 Haji Mahboob, the Muslim party of the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid land issue, said that he has a formula to solve the Ram temple issue
 vahaan par ram mandir bane, isamen bhi koi aapatti nahin he, lekin iske liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ke str par pahal honi chahie
 In this case, the matter will be made only after the initiative of PM Modi
 unhone kaha ki hindustan main hajaaron mandir hai, ek mandir or ho jayega, to isamen koi buraai nahin hai
 Even before this, Haji Mehboob has said that the matter should be resolved at the level of PM Modi
 pichley saal hi unhone kaha tha ki desh ke liye musalmaan qurbaani denge
 Let me tell you that before the Lok Sabha elections, the politics regarding the construction of Ram temple has intensified
 sadhu-saton samet kai hinduvadi sanghathan ram mandir nirmaan ke liye centre kii modi sarkaar or rajya kii yogi adityanath sarkaar par lagaataar dabaav bana rahi he
 Recently Dharma Sansad was organized in Ayodhya and Prayagraj
 ismensdhu-santonaur hinduvadi sanghathanon ne ram mandir kaa nirmaan jald karne kii maang kii thi
 Apart from this, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the mother organization of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is also pressurizing the government to build the Ram temple
 philhal is maamle kii sunwyeesupreme courtmen chal rahi he
 The apex court has constituted a 5-member bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi to hear the Ram Temple case earlier this month
 is maamle kii sunwaayee 29 janvari ko honi thi, lekin justise sharad arvind bobade ke maujuud na rahane kii vajah se isko taal diya gaya he
 At the same time, resentment is increasing among saints and Hinduist organizations due to postponement of hearing in this case
 farji degree maamalon main aksar kai netaaon ke naam saamne aate rahe hai
 This time also a similar issue came up here, in which the Social Welfare Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Asiya Nakash, before reaching graduation, L
 elbi
 Degree acquired
 pehali najar main hi chaunkaane vaali yah jaankaree chif elactoral afasar (jammu- kashmir) kii aadhikarik website se hasil hui he
 In which there are affidavits filled by ASIA, in which all their information is available
 asia se is babat puche jane par unhone kaha ki is baat kii pushti vishvavidhyalay se praapt karen
 According to him, this could be a typing flaw
 website par maujuud dastavejon ke mutabik asia ne varsh 1992 main pehle bachaler of lau kiya or baad main varsh 1996 main bie
 According to the website, the affidavit filled by Asia
 us affidavit ke serial number 10 ke part-1 main bhare gaye byore ke mutabik varsh 1996 main unhone kashmir vishvavidhyalay se bie kiya he, jabaki part-2 main unhone likhaa he ki varsh 1992 main unhone kashmir vishvavidhyalay se bachaler of lau (elelbi) kii degree hasil kii he
 The question is how one can get legal education before graduating
 haalanki ab iskaa bhi praavdhaan he ki 12veen kaksha ke baad kanoonee shiksha praapt kii ja sakati he
 There is a five-year course for this, but the year in which Asiya Naqsh received his legal education, the course did not start at Kashmir University at that time

 But this challenge has become a fun experience for me

 In addition to the Spanish actress Maria Velverde, the film will also feature Thomas Jane, Sean Patrick and Chris Margret

 Telling the Center that there will be less rain in the states, giving an example of Haryana, the state is saying that it has adequate irrigation system, but the Center finds that it will have to tell Haryana if there will be less rain

 After Piyush Goyal's charge in the finance ministry, at least it is clear that the government is going to do something special in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kii chunavi chintaaon ke lihaaj se yah tay he ki farvari kii pehali taarikh ko sansad ke patal par rakhaa jane vaala antarim bajet mahaj lekhanudaan pesh karne kii aupchaarikta nahin rahane vaala he, balki sarkaar use kuch khaas banane kii taiyaari main he
 There are indications that there will be some populist announcements in this interim budget
 vitt mantralay ke do vibhageeya aadesh is baat kii pushti karte prathit hote hai
 This is clearly indicated by reading two letters of the Ministry of Finance
 dilachasp he ki vitt mantralay ne apane vijyapti (offis memorondom) main ek bahut chota sanshodhan kiya he par uskaa asar bada hoga
 The first communique was sent on 3 January 2019, amending which now all ministries have been asked to send details of expenditure for new initiatives or new measures (new majors or new services)
 yah patr aarthik maamalon ke vibhaag ke bajet anubhag ne bheji he or sanshodhit chitthee 9 janvari 2019 ko bheji gai he
 Obviously, this is the first indication that the government is in the process of doing something big and some big plans are being prepared inside
 parampara ke mutabik, 3 janvari ko aarthik maamalon ke vibhaag ne ek vibhageeya aadesh (departmental order DO
 NO
 2(46)-b(dy2018) sabhi mantralayon ke vitt salaahkaaron ko bheja tha jisamen rekhaankit pankti thi ki, "amuman sansad main kendriya bajet 1 farvari ko pesh kiya jaataa he
 Since the Lok Sabha general elections are likely to be held in April / May, this year the central government will present the interim budget of 2019-20 on February 1, 2019
 "is aadesh main sabhi mantralayon ko soochna di gai thi ki'2019-20 ke liye antarim bajet pesh karne ke baad sarkaar agle vitt varsh ke chaar maheenon ke kharchon ke liye (april se july) ek lekhanudaan pesh karegi (isamen nae sevaaon par kharch shaamil nahin honge) or 2019-20 ke bajet ke aavantnon ke ek tihaai hissaa hi shaamil hoga
 'ministries were asked to send their heads by 10 January 2019, reviewing the april-july expenses and requirements judiciously
 'pehle patr main mantralayon ko saavdhaan kiya gaya thaidhyaan dene vaali baat he ki lekhanudaan kii avadhi main
 No expenditure on new services should be included, unless a full-year vote is passed and a bill for authorized spending is passed accordingly
 lekin 9 janvari, 2019 ko sabhi mantralayon ko ek sanshodhit vibhageeya vijyapti bheji gai, jisase kahani main nayaa mode aa gaya
 This release number OM (F
 No
 As per 2 ('16) -8 (D) / 2018), while sending the details, all the Ministries / Departments should note that in addition to all the new services required in item No
 2, the details should also be provided
 in donon patron kii pratiindia tudeke paas he
 This may seem a little trivial and simple, but in reality it may also open new doors by taking new measures against tradition
 haalanki aisa karnaa asanvaidhanik yaa gaiyr-kanoonee nahin hoga ki koi sarkaar loksabhaa chunaav se ain pehle bajet main nitiyon or nae karon ke prastaav laae
 Later, the new government can also reverse these proposals
 baharhaal, parampara yahi rahi he ki apana kaarykaal khatm karne vaali sarkaar sansad kii sanstuti sirf agali sarkaar gathit karne tak kii avadhi tak sarkaar chalaane bhar ke kharch kii manjuuri ke liye leti he
 However, this tradition has been broken even earlier
 masalan, saal 2014 main upie-2 ke vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne kaaron or telecom handset ke liye 4 fisadi apratyaksh kar riyaayat kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Along with this, a proposal for reduction of taxes was also introduced to make cars, mobile phones, tvs and fridges cheaper
 haal ke dinon main, siyaasi galiyaaron main sarkaar ke do bade upayon par charchaa chal rahi he
 It is reported that there may be a big announcement for farmers on the lines of one of these Bhavantar Yojana
 iske jariye madhya pradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan kii sarkaar kisaanon ke khate main sidhe nakad rakam hastantarit karti thi or naukareepesha varg ke liye iskar kii seemaa ko upar karne ke upaay kii bhi charchaa he
 Will the government resort to an interim budget on 1 February to appease the angry farmers and woo middle class voters? There will be political chaos, but the answer lies in the budget speech itself

 There is a demand to relocate it outside the village
 gaanv se ek kilometre kii duuri par sthit primary skool, jahaan gaanv ke bachche padhane jate hai, uski charadivari tak nahin he
 On this demand, at one time the minister went to the village, Mahadev Singh Khandela of Shekhawati, but he was not even heard there

 Don't think you know what the film is? Yes, filmmaker Amit Khanna has brought a new entry in the order of films made on deception
 aaiye pataa karte hai ye kitni alag he film
 Story: The beginning of the film narrates the plot
 chandigarh main nari (suzana mukherjee) apane karj main duube hue boyfriend dev (siddant gupta) ko dhokhaa detii he or uske paise lekar bhaag jaati he
 Then it becomes a means for him to earn money
 uskaa aglaa nishaanaa hota he jaizi (shaarib hashmi), jo ek local don ke kirdaar main he
 The film also stars Pinkesh (karan Mehra) who is Dev's friend but he also has a love for the woman he never expresses
 nari jaizi ko bhi chuunaa lagaakar rafuchakkar ho jaati he or don sahab uski talash karne lagate hai
 That is, an attempt has been made to make a masala film by taking the track of different love stories together
 kyon dekhen:agar aap upar likhe huye kisi bhi actor ke diwane hai to hi ye film dekhe
 Sharib Hashmi, whose film 'filmistan' was liked by some people, leaves a small impression in this film too
 kyon na dekhen:jab bahut sari kahaniyaan ek saath ek hi film main chalati rahati hai to ve aapako bhramit karti hai or uskaa nateeja bhi sifer hi rahata he
 The script is quite loose and there is no dialogue that will surprise or surprise you
 kul milakar film main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo aapako utsahit kare
 The songs also do not affect much

 At the same time, Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh told Aaj Tak that he was welcome from the party's side, but he left the answer to the BJP leader on the question of which seat he would contest
 dilli sarkaar varsej modi sarkaaris dauraan kejariwal ne centre sarkaar par kaam nahin karne kaa aarope lagaaya or kaha ki centre sarkaar dilli sarkaar ko bhi kaam nahin karne de rahi he
 He compared the functioning of the three-year Delhi government vs PM Narendra Modi's government
 iske liye unhone modi style main hi vahaan maujuud janata se unki raay lee or poocha ki dilli ke andar kejariwal hajaar mohalla clinics banavaa saktaa he to modi puure desh main kyun nahin?” unhone aage kaha ki puure desh kii janata centre sarkaar ko ukhaad phenkna chaahati he
 It was the purpose of the meeting that Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh undertook a padyatra in Uttar Pradesh
 usee ke sambandh main ye sabha yojit kii gai thi
 Sanjay Sinha fiercely targeted the Yogi government of UP during this period
 unhone gorakhpur main hone vaali bacchon kii maut kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki yogi raaj main upi rogi raaj ban gaya he
 Actually, the Aam Aadmi Party wants to set its foot in the politics of UP in view of 2019
 aise main party upi ko chaar alag- alag rajyon main baantne ke mudde ko bhi uthaane ke mood main he
 Woman's commotion in public meeting: In this meeting of man party, a woman made a fierce commotion

 After this, the woman fiercely cut the ruckus

 ) The three-year-old alliance of Congress and National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir has been broken
 jammu-kashmir ke mukhyamantri umr abdulla ne 'aaj tak' ko die khaas intervyuu main kaha, 'gathbandhan todane kaa faisla neshnal conference ne kiya tha
 In this connection, i met Congress President Sonia Gandhi 10 days ago and talked about contesting alone in the upcoming assembly elections
 umr ne bataaya ki rajya main congress ke kuch netaa kaaphi samay se neshnal conference ke saath milakar chunaav ladane ke paksh main nahin the
 That is why we decided to contest alone in the upcoming election
 umr ne gathbandhan tode jane ke congress ke elaan par aapatti jataai
 He said that it would have been better if both parties had made this announcement together
 congress ne elaan ko aise pesh karne kii koshish kii jaise ye faisla unka hi he
 While reality is different from this
 party kaa congress ke saath pichley chunaav kaa anubhav thik nahin rahaa he
 Regarding the preparation of the National Conference for the upcoming elections after the Lok Sabha elections, Omar said that this assembly election will be difficult for all parties
 agar kisi party ko lagata he ki chunaav unke liye aasaan he
 So that would be their misunderstanding
 sansadeey chunaav se party kii awam ke bich sthiti badali he par party kii jameen rajya main puri tarah abhi bhi taiyaar nahin he
 Omar said about the possibility of a coalition government being formed in the state, 'if the voter wants the coalition government again
 to wo phir waisi hi sarkaar ke liye vot karegaa
 i believe that the coalition government is not good for the state but it is up to the voters to decide what kind of government they want
 'pradhanmantri narendra modi ke jammu-kashmir ke prati rujhaan ke bare main umr ne kaha ki modi kii jammu-kashmir kii samasyaon main khaas ruchi he
 We have not found such signs yet
 modi kashmir kii andruni raajnneeti , jeeography or samasyaon ko yaa to samaj nahin rahe hai, yaa phir vah ise samajhnaa hi nahin chaah rahe hai
 Omar said, "iit's announcement for Jammu and not giving anything to Kashmir can send a wrong message among the people
 modi kashmiriyon ko jaanboojhkar peeche dhakelne ke liye aisa kar rahe hai yaa to wo yahaan kii raajnneeti ko samaj hi nahin rahe hai
 Something can be said about this in the coming times
 aagaamee vidhansabha main umr abdulla ne behatar chunavi nateezon kii ummid jataai
 Omar said, 'the National Conference will perform better in the coming election than in the previous election'
 gauratlab he ki ravivaar ko congress mahasachiv gulam bani aaazaad ne press conference karke neshnal conference se gathbandhan tuutane kaa aupchaarik elaan kiya
 He also made it clear that the party will contest all the seats alone

 com puri duniya ne nae saal kaa swaagat dil khol kar kiya, is dauraan har koi jashn main duba hua tha
 But when the US military's strategic command tried to wish people a new year with a joke, the dice backfired
 sena kii ore se twit kiya gaya tha ki vah nae saal ke maukey par times squaire par kuch bada gira sakate hai, jisaki soshal media par kaaphi aalochana hui
 Indeed, America's Strategic Command (@us_stratcom) apologized on Monday for its "inappropriate" joke about being prepared to drop something bigger than the traditional crystal ball on Times Square on New Year's Eve
 sena ne twit karke kaha tha ki vah navvarsh main times squaire par paaramparik crystal ball ke bajaae ‘‘isse bhi bahut bada’’ kuch giraane ke liye taiyaar he
 Our previous NYE tweet was in poor taste & does not reflect our values
 We apologize
 We are dedicated to the security of America & allies
 — US Strategic Command (@us_stratcom)december 31, 2018america parmaanu aayudhashala kaa niyantran dekhne vaale sainya bal ne twitor par ek video jari kiya tha jisamen bi-2 bamavarshak bam gira rahaa tha
 The message was written with this video, "if ever needed, we are ready to drop something very, very big from it
 is sandesh ko baad main delit kar diya gaya tha
 "it is noteworthy that the slogan of 'strategic Command' is -" Peace is our profession
 ’’soshal media par is twit ko lekar aalochanaon kaa shikaar hone ke baad use delit kar diya gaya tha
 Military force apologized via tweet
 sainya bal ne kaha, ‘‘navvarsh kii purv sandhya par hamaara pehle kiya gaya twit uchit nahin tha or yah hamaare mulyon ko pratibimbit nahin karata, ham maafee maangate hai
 We are dedicated to protecting America and our allies
 ’’ These days there is a mutiny in Iraq
 kuch saal pehle jab iraq se america sena waapas lauti thi to ummid yahi thi ki ek behatar iraq ubharkar saamne aayega
 But three years later, Iraq seems to be engulfed by a deep crisis
 or alam ye he ki is sulagate hue iraq ko dekhakar puri duniya tapish mahasoos kar rahi he
 Sunni terrorists have captured two big cities
 kurd kii sena daawa kar rahi he ki kirkuk shahar ko khaali karvaa liya gaya
 But one truth is that even the Iraqi army's feet were uprooted by the fear of the terrorists roaming the slaughterhouse
 kai shahar jihadiyon ke kabje meniraq main sunni jihadiyon ne puure mulk par apana kabja karne ke liye jang ched rakhi he
 And the Iraqi army is struggling to drive out those jihadis
 jihadiyon kii khatarnaak iraade itane tej hai ki un logon ne iraq ke kai shaharon ko apane kabje main to kar hi liya he
 Slaughtering has also intensified
 katleam kii tasveeron ko dekhakar duniya ke kai mulkon kii neenden ud chuki he
 Especially of India
 
 Because it is not merely telling the story of the terrorists atrocities on Iraqis
 balki duniya ke tamaam chote bade deshon ko khun ke aansu rulaane kii dastaan bhi suna rahi he
 In fact, Sunni jihadis who came out to occupy Iraq have captured many such cities of Iraq
 jahaan iraq kaa asli khajaana yani kaccha tel or uski rifinary hai
 Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is now under the occupation of the jihadis
 iesas ke aatankiyon ne somvaar ko salahaddeen soobe ke shahar biji or tikrit par bhi kabja kar liya
 
 or in shaharon ke jihadiyon ke kabje main jane ke baad hi puri duniya sakate main aa gai he kyonki biji main iraq kii sabase badi oil rifinary he
 
 to duniya manhagaai kii chapet main chali jaaegiye baat sabhi jaanate hai ki saudi arab ke baad iraq hi wo mulk he jahaan tel kaa utpaadan duniya main sabase zyada hota he
 And the same crude oil is the cause of trouble all over the world
 kyonki agar jihadiyon ne iraq ke tamaam tel par apana kabja jamaa liya to puri duniya manhagaai kii chapet main chali jaaegi
 Currently, there is a war between Iraqi forces and jihadis to save Baghdad
 sunni jehadi abhi baghdad se kareeb 55 mile dur hai
 Of course, the number of jihadis is much less than that of the Iraqi army
 baavjood iske iraqi fouj mushkil se unka muqabla kar rahi he
 Because the revelation is that at this time the leaders of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party are helping the Sunni jihadis who are out on the bloodshed, who are away from the grip of the American army
 isi bich ek or khulaase ne duniya kii neend uda di he
 Along with the Jihadis, they are also giving British citizens
 jo pichley kaaphi arase se iraq main rah rahe the
 No one else has disclosed this
 balki britain ke videsh sachiv wiliam hegg ne apni parliament main kiya
 After this shocking revelation, the world is now eyeing Iraq
 kyonki sunni jihadiyon ne iraq main jabardast tareeke se khun kharaba karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Alam is that a handful of jihadis have driven several thousand citizens out of the city
 puure iraq main rocket laancharon se hamalaa karte, tinkon se raundte or tabadatod goliyaan barasaate is sanghathan ke aatankwaadi dikhne lage hai
 At the same time, there is an orgy of death on the streets of Iraq
 or viraane main bichhi bekasooron kii laashen
 Will the US and Iran join hands because of the ongoing civil war in Iraq
 kya donon ek-duusare se kandhe se kandhaa mila kar jang-e-maidan main utrenge
 However, both of them can be due to time and circumstances
 lekin phir bhi khabar yahi he ki america or iraan
 ISIS militants from Iraq can join hands to expel each other
 america or iraan aae saathiraq main tezi se badalte halaat ne do dushman deshon america or iraan ko saath laa diya he
 If the UK foreign secretary made the shocking disclosure that some British-origin citizens were supporting the terrorists of The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, then it is also a shocking truth that the enemy countries will never face each other directly Did not talk wo ab iraq ko iesas ke aatankwaadiyon kii giraft se chhudaane ke liye jang ke maidan main ikaithe nazar aaenge
 According to US Home Secretary John Carrey, if Iran supports America in this fight, then it will be a reasonable step
 vaise aapako bataa den ki saal 1979 ke baad se hi donon mulkon ke sambandh achche nahin rahe he
 According to John Carrie, ISIS is currently the biggest threat in Iraq
 or wo us khatre ko khatm karne ke liye har zaruri kadam uthaaenge
 By the way, he said that apart from airstrikes against ISIS terrorists, the US is also considering other options
 darasal donon mulk iraq ke ek or shahar tal afar par aatankwadishon ke kabze ke baad ek duusare kaa saath dene kaa man bana rahe hai
 On the other hand, according to Hamid Abotalebi, close to Iran's President Hassan Rohani, the US and Iran are in a position to solve the problem of Iraq by supporting each other
 vaise jaankaron kii maane to unke mutabik america ko iesas ke aatankwaadiyon ko iraq se baahar khadedane ke liye hawaii hamale karne hi padege
 Currently, the US is sending a contingent of 275 soldiers to protect its embassy in Baghdad
 is vakt baghdad main america ke 170 sainik hi maujuud hai
 In addition, the US has deployed its Navy warships USS George W
 H
 Bush in the Persian Gulf, as well as USS Misa Verde, USS Arle Burke, USS Txton, USS O, Kane, and USS Philippine Sea
 vaise bhartiya sarkaar ne bhi iraq bigadate halaat par chintaa jataai he
 According to the Foreign Ministry, India strongly criticizes the terrorist attacks in Iraq
 iske saath bhartiya videsh mantralay pehle hi iraq main sabhi bharatiyon se kah chukaa he ki ki wo jald se jald iraq chhod den
 For this, the Indian embassy in Baghdad will help them return to their homeland
 lekin sutron ke mutabik iraq ke mosul or tikrit main 50 bhartiya norsen fansi hui hai
 And both these cities are occupied by ISIS terrorists
 lekin kya america iraq se aatankwaadiyon ko khadedane ke liye iraan kii madad legaa ye to aane vaale dinon main saaf ho jayega
 But by then ISIS militants would have committed even more murder on the land of Iraq
 kyonki iraq main har bitate din ke saath halaat bad se badtar hote ja rahe hai
 For thirty years, Iraq has been burning in the fire of war, when the fire of civil war in Iraq will not go out
 iraq kaa har bashinda yahi soch rahaa he
 Because if we look at the history of Iraq, for the last thirty years, Iraq has been burning in the fire of war
 irakiyon ne pehle iraan se jang dekhi
 Then saw the war to get the country out of the hands of Saddam and now it is falling between the war between the Iraqi army and ISIS militants
 duniya ke nakshe par iraq pichley 24 saal se sulag rahaa he, shahar ke shahar tabah ho gaye
 Thousands of people died, but the process of mutiny continues
 
 And now its heat is reaching the world
 2 agast 1990 se jo iraq main jang kaa jo silsilaa shuru hua, uski aag main 20 march 2003 main iraq phir se jag uthaa
 Yes, the US, along with its allies, attacked Iraq, saying it had biological weapons
 iraq or america ke bich puure8 saal tak ye jang chalati rahi
 As the whole of Iraq was devastated
 america ne saddaam ke tamaam thikaanon ko nestanabood kar diya
 Saddam Hussein was hanged
 iraq ko saddaam hossain kii taanaashaahee se nijaat to mili, lekin sukun nahin
 In the last war, four and a half thousand US soldiers were killed inside Iraq, 32 thousand were disabled
 ab abu bakaal bagdadi kaa kohramek baar phir iraq main gadar machaa he, osama bin laden ko guru maanane vaala abu bakaal bagdadi, islamic kanoon lagu karaane ke naam par aatank machaa rahaa he
 The world is expressing concern over this civil war in Iraq
 ab sawaal ye he ki iraq ko nae laden ke aatank sekaun or kaise nijaat dilaaegaa
 Eyes are set towards America
 iraq main har jagah khun-kharabiraq kii sarazamiin jang-e-maidan main tabdeel ho chuki he
 If something is seen everywhere then there are signs of destruction and ruin
 iraq kii phizaon main goliyon or bamon ke fatne kii awaz gunj rahi he
 There is a view of murder everywhere
 or is tabaahi ke bich main bharat ke kuch log bhi vahaan fanse he jo roji kamaane ke liye iraq gaye the
 His family alleges that the companies in which they were working have run away leaving them and now there is no one to ask them there
 iraq main fanse hindustaniiraq ke shaharon main katleam or khoonkhrabe se punjab ke in logon kaa dil kaanp rahaa he
 Somebody's son, somebody's father
 kisi kaa shuhar iraq main bam barood ke bich fanse pade hai 
 Gurpinder Kaur, a resident of Amritsar, was working with her friends in an Iraqi company, but there are no reports of 41 people amid the terror attacks
 company ne in logon ko katleam ke bich chod diya or khud kamdhandha samet kar bhaag khadi hui
 Most of the 46 nurses working in Tikrit and close areas cannot return to their homeland even if they want to
 dhai lakh tak kaa lone lekar wo iraq pahunchi hai or isi boj ne unhen khataron ke bich rahane ko majaboor kar diya he 
 Even the Red Cross has given up their defense
 kottayam kii rahane vaali merina is vakt tikrit ke hospital main jakhmiyon ko jindagi dene kaa kaam kar rahi hai lekin aaj khud unki jindagi khatre main hai or yahaan unka parivaar pareshaan
 More than 2 thousand Hindustani are stranded in Iraq
 At present, more than 2 thousand Hindustani are stranded there
 kuch khushkismat to vakt rahete vatan laut aae lekin baakiyon kaa koi thikaana nahin 
 Most of the people who have gone from India to cities like Tikrit, Mosul, Baghdad, Basra are either working in hospitals or in construction companies
 jahaan tahaan muthbhedon or hamalon ke chalate sadak ke raste band ho chuke hai or airport tak janaa bhi naammumkin 
 The fear is that if America attacks the terrorists, then the situation will get out of hand
 bihar or pashchim bengal kii vidhwaaon ne bijepi saansad hema malini se kathith bayaan ko waapas lene kii maang kii he or kaha ki ve vrundavan ghoomane-phirane ke liye nahin balki ‘mukti’ ke liye aayin hai
 Hema Malini had said about Vrindavan of her parliamentary constituency Mathura on the 16th of this month that there should not be crowds of widows from Bihar and West Bengal, there are 40 thousand widows in Vrindavan and there is no place for more

 Mandloi, a resident of Vrindavan, who has been living in Vrindavan for the last 15 years after her husband's death, said that Hema's words have hurt her
 unhone kaha ki vibhinn kaarnon se duniyavi jivan se alag ho chuke or apane ko bhagwaan ko samarpit kar rahe logon ke liye kya vrundavan, mathura or varanasi jaisi koi anya jagah ho sakati he
 Anjana Goswami, a resident of Maharashtra, said that widows feel satisfied by doing bhajan-kirtan for Lord Krishna in Vrindavan
 patna main janmi kaushalya devi (70) or odisha se aarti mistre ne hema malini kii kathith tippanee par aitraaj jataate hue kaha ki ve paramparaagat ‘madhukaari’ kaa paalan kar rahi hai
 He told that Madhukari do not take full food from one house but instead collect little food from house to house so that the family members do not have any problem
 vrundavan main vidhwaaon ke upekshit rahane par supreme court ke vednaa prakat kiye jane ke baad 2012 main sulabh international ne hastkshep karte hue vahaan ke vibhinn ashramon main rah raheen kareeb ek hajaar vidhwaaon kii dekhbhaal shuru kii

 The BJP has fielded a novice Ko Sam's Health Minister Hemant Vishwa Sharma for the first time in his stronghold, bjp's Pradyut Bora, against Health Minister and Congress's leading election campaigner Hemant Vishwa Sharma
 bora mahaj isliye jane jate hai ki ve 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main laalkrishna adwani ke charchit online abhiyaan ke prabharee the
 Sharma won the Jalukbadi seat in the 2006 election by 1 lakh votes
 unka vyapak janaadhar bhi he
 Due to deteriorating health of Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, Sharma has emerged as not only the Chief Election Campaigner of the Congress, but also his number two position in the State Congress
 congress kaaryakarta bataate hai ki jab bhi gogoi or sharma ek saath kisi raily ko sambodhit karne jate hai, tab mukhyamantri pehle bhaashan dena pasand karte hai, kyonki sharma ke bhaashan ke turant baad bheed titarabitar hone lagati he
 Despite this, Bora believes they will win
 saint stephens college ke chaatr rahe or iiem, ahmedabad se graduate bora kehete hai, ''sharma ek bure aadmi hai
 i am a good person, because i never murdered anyone
 main tex chukaata hum
 i am not a former ULFA member and i have never been involved in extortion
 ''haalanki jab unase poocha jaataa he ki kya sharma ne koi khun kiya he yaa ve kabhi ulpha ke sadsy rahe hai, to bora iskaa jawaab taal jate hai, lekin kehete hai, ''main is par tippanee nahin karuunga, lekin bura aadmi achche aadmi kaa bilkul ulat hota he
 "but the voters of Jalukbadi do not agree with Bora's arguments
 sualkuchi ke bipul medhi kehete hai, ''aap mantri ko bura aadmi kaise kah sakate hai? unhone hamaara jivan sudhara he, sadakon or swasthya kendron kii haalat sudhari he
 He has provided employment to every unemployed youth
 mujhe apni pratibha ke aadhaar par naukari mili, uske liye kisi ko ghoose nahin deni padi
 The voters are also not impressed with Bora's academic achievements
 unke maujuuda vidhayak sharma uttarpurvi maamalon main piech
 D
 hai or coton college ke chaatr rahe hai
 Sharma has challenged Bora to look at him with a specific charge
 sharma kehete hai, ''kisi ko badnaam karnaa bahut aasaan he
 After all, what are the charges against me? There is not a single charge against me
 ''unka daawa he ki unhone 5,000 berozegaar yuvaaon ko sarkari naukari di he
 They say, "next time maybe they tell me a member of Al Qaeda
 '' lekin bora bhi unhen aasaani se chhodane vaale nahin
 He says, "where is development?" Sharma specializes in misleading
 baihata chaariyaali ke paas ke teen gaanvon main bijli nahin he
 Sharma laughed at the laughter at this, "he went out of my constituency to prove the charge against me
" '' haalanki sharma ke janaadhar se bora waakif hai, lekin ve is chunaav ko apane liye ek avasar kii tarah dekh rahe hai
 He says, "1 in our constituency"
 5 lakh se adhik matadaata hai
 He has given jobs to 5,000 people
 rojgaar paa chuke un 5,000 logon ke padosi, dost or rishtedaar berozegaar honge or khud ko thaga gaya mahasoos kar rahe honge

 However, the police came into action and immediately handed over the investigation to the CID

 BJP general secretary Kailash Vijay Vargali has written a letter to the National Human Rights Commission, seeking to intervene in it

 One abducted teenager has been rescued from the ashram so far, more than 150 girls, including more than 20 minor girls, are living in hell in the ashram and despite the arrest of thousands of suspicious types of cds, no arrests have been made from the ashram
 yah haal tab he jab dhyaan yoga sikhaane ke naam par kishoriyon ko phuslane vaale ashram ke 64 varshiya sanchaalak baba virendra dev dikshit urf shiv baba par farrukhabad jile main hi balaatkaar or apharan ke chah maamle darj hai
 This Baba, who describes himself as the gender of Shiva, is currently away from the police
 police uske khilaaf maamla darj kar apane kaam kii itishree kar chuki he
 The result of this hijacking by the police was that on September 1, a rage was raged in the ashram by an unnecessarily angry mob trying to find a four-year-old missing girl
 halaat ko kaabo karne ke liye prashasan ko police bal tainaat karnaa padaa
 Anjali Yadav, the commander of the Gulabi Gang, a social organization that used to raise the entire matter loudly, called the police action a sham
 unhone kaha, ''police ne ashram ko sari chijen durust karne kaa puraa mauka diya
 In other cases, the police secretly conduct raids, while raiding the ashram with search warrants has already appeared in newspapers
 ''nawab mohammad khan bangash kaa sthapit kiya or tab ke shahenshaah farrukhsier ke naam par bana madhya uttar pradesh ke kanpur pramandal main sthit farrukhabad darasal fatehgarh ke saath do shaharon vaala ek shahar he jo aalu kii banpar paidaavaar ke liye janaa jaataa he
 This ashram of the posh Siktarbagh colony came into prominence on 28 August this year when Rakesh Kumar of Banda pleaded with the police that his 16-year-old daughter Meena was abducted in the ashram
 jab ladki ke maa-baap ne beti se milane kii koshish kii to pehle to unhen beti se milane hi nahin diya gaya, or jab ashram vaale use dene par raji ho gaye to police or parijan ashram kaa chappa-chappa khangaalane ke baavjood minaa ko dhundh nahin paae
 It was only after senior police and administration officials arrived that the ashram handed over Meena to her parents
 haa, is dauraan ashram kaa badnuma cheharaa jarur saamne aayaa jisamen dikhaa ki ladakiyon ko tahkhanenuma kamaron main rakhaa ja rahaa he, jahaan ve apana sir bhi nahin uthaa saktin
 On August 28, after the news of the recovery of some girls from the ashram, many parents started reaching the ashram to find their missing daughters
 lekin police baraamad ladakiyon ko pehle hi ashram ko lautaa chuki thi, isliye parijanon kii pareshaani bad gai
 Radhika of Barout was also one of the unlucky mothers who saw their baby girl in this ashram
 lekin radhika ko ashram main pravesh karne kaa mauka 1 sitambar ko hi mil paaya, ashram kaa bhandaphod hone ke puure chaar din baad
 When Radhika reached the ashram in the presence of the magistrate's search warrant and police, the doors of the ashram did not open despite hours of hard work

 india today ne jab ashram kaa najaara dekha to na to vahaan sidi kaa jakhira dikhaai diya or na dukhiyaari maa ko uski khoi beti hi mili
 Gufran Shamsi and others living near the ashram told India Today that in the last four days, there were many vehicles coming and going here at night
 kai logon ne shaq jataayaa ki sambhav he, 28 agast ko baraamad huin bahut-si ladkiyaan duusari jagah bhej di gai hon
 After filtering the ashram, Radhika said, "my daughter is with these people and they are not returning her
" ashram ko meri hai lagegi
 "amit Manchanda, who lives right in front of the ashram, said that on September 1, the vehicles had gone from here
 28 agast ko ladkiyaan baraamad hone ke baavjood unhen ashram ko kyon saunp diya gaya, is sawaal par police adheekshak sagar ne india today ko bataaya, ''hamen sirf ek ladki ke apharan kii soochna mili thi or use baraamad kar liya gaya
 a case has also been registered against Baba in this regard
 baaki ke bare main shikaayat nahin mili isliye karrwai sambhav nahin he
 These girls are in the ashram at the will of their parents
 '' yah poochne par ki balaatkaar ke aaropee baba ke ashram main naaballig ladakiyon kii maujuudagi kya police ke khud karrwai karne ke liye paryaapt vajah nahin he, sagar ne kaha ki is maamle main magistrate jaanch ke aadesh die ja chuke hai
 Kotwali police station in-charge Kaluram Dohra, who is investigating the case, said, "there is no concrete evidence, but all is not well in the ashram
" '' yah pehla mauka nahin he jab yah ashram vivaadon main ghira he
 Social worker Ravindra Singh says, "every two or two years in the ashram, some grieving parents come to find their daughters
 inamen se kai maamalon main report bhi darj hui he lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main ladkiyaan ghar jane se inkaar kar detii hai
 a police officer said that the officers themselves do not want to take the initiative, while the small policemen are afraid of false cases being organized by the ashram
 ek mahila police adhikari ne bataaya ki ashram main har jagah taale hi taale lage rahete the
 When Meena was rescued on 28 August, the police had to break the locks in most cases and had to face opposition from the ashram
 pataa nahin, ashram kii is ghutan bhari duniya main koun si padhai hoti he
 But one example of this study was found in India Today by a sentence written on a sticker regarding Shivalinga
 yah 'bodh vaakya' kuch yun tha, ''baap ne samajhayaa he, vah shankar kaa extra part nahin, vah next tu shiv he

 ' is sawaal par ki kya ham ummid karen ki aap bhavishya main raajnneeti main aaengi, priyanka ne kaha, 'main iske liye bhavishya main sochoongi ki kya karnaa he
 Priyanka admitted that there is some resentment among the people of Amethi for some reasons
 unhone kaha, 'yahaan ke log kisi dal ke nahin hai, sabakaa mujhase dil kaa rishta he, lekin ve kisi na kisi karanvash naaraaz hai
 For this reason they often protest but i will try to bring them along
 ' Asked how the atmosphere felt while taking charge of campaigning in Amethi for so many days, Priyanka said, 'we had some problems then they came from their own organization

 Due to the abundance of fake news (fake news) on social media, innocent people were beaten to death in many parts of the country
 bharat sarkaar ne watsape ko apane plateform kaa durupyog hone se rokane main naakaam rahane par mangalvaar ko aagaah kiya tha
 In a reply sent to the Indian government on Wednesday, whatsapp has said that it is 'scared' of such incidents
 watsape ne phek news or afvaahon ke ‘aatank’ ke khilaaf samuchit kadam uthaane kaa aashwaasan bhi diya he
 Explain that on Tuesday, the Government of India, in its statement, had taken a strict stand and warned this messaging service and accused it of taking an irresponsible stand
 watsape ne bharat sarkaar ko likhi chitthee main kaha he ki wo logon kii suraksha ko lekar gaharaai se chintit he or saath hi usne phek news or afvaahon ke aatank se ladane ke kadam uthaae hai
 whatsapp has said in the letter that we are afraid of these dreadful incidents of violence and want to act swiftly in response to the important issues that you have raised
 company ke mutabik wo bhartiya shodhakartaaon ke saath samasya ko acchhee tarah samajhane ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 Also, such changes are being made so that fake messages can be prevented from spreading
 darasal naa sirf watsape balki soshal media ke tamaam plateforms ko bhi farji khabaron ke prasar ko prabhavi dhang se naa roak paane ke liye haalia vakt main baari dabaav se guzarana pad rahaa he
 whatsapp's parent company Facebook already believes that fake news is a big challenge
 fasebuk kii ore se is bare me kai kadam bhi uthaae ja chuke hai
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned in his post on 19 January this year, 'there is too much sensation, misinformation and polarization in the world today
 soshal media logon ko pehle kii tulana main kahin teji se suchanaaen pahunchane kaa kaam kar rahaa he
 And if we did not deal with these problems properly, then we will see these problems getting worse
 ’ jakarberg kii ye bhavishyavaanee bharat main khatarnaak dhang se sahi bhi sabit ho gai
 Let us tell you that at least 29 people were beaten to death in one year due to rumors of kidnapping children on social platforms
 aise main sawaal ye he ki kya technology companiyaan phek news kii chunauti se nipatane ke liye us str par koshishen nahin kar rahi hai jis str par unhen kerani chahie
 Delhi-based cyber expert Jitin Jain says, "if these companies can accurately track your modalities of using the Internet for advertising, you will have to update your mails for meetings, flight information and hotel bookings
" If they can scan, why can't they filter the content related to violence, fake news and morphed photos and videos? ”says Jain
 The main focus is on those areas from where they can earn money
 aise main kya takanic ke sahare phek news ko chaan kar alag karne ke liye phulpruf kadam uthaae ja sakate hai? iskaa jawaab is baat main chupa he ki kya phek yaa farji he or kya nahin, ise paribhaashit kiya jaae or isaki pukhta pahchaan kii jaae
 a short film 'fight against misinformation' on Facebook's social platform newsroom page tries to find answers to all these questions and curiosities
 fasebuk ke new feed intigrity vertical main product manager tisa leones kaa is chunauti par kahana he, “meraa maananaa he ki is tarah kaa atirek vaala kadam bura hoga ki fasebuk karmchaariyon kii ore se log jo kuch bhi post karne kii koshish karte hai, us sabaki hi samiksha kii jaae
 Also, it should be decided on their behalf whether the content of the post is false or true
 phir usee ke hisaab se tay kiya jaae ki contate ko plateform par rahane diya jaae yaa nahin
 "I also believe that it would be bad not to take any kind of responsibility and allow hate speech and violence to be broadly distributed," Lyons said
 ye paryaapt jimmedaari lene se pallaa jhaadne jaisaa hoga
 The correct path or answer lies between these two
 
 
 lekin wo ek bada madhya he
 Antonia Woodford, another product manager in the News Feed Integrity section, believes that if someone uploads a misleading photo or video, it becomes more challenging
 kyonki wo zyada vijual hote hai or unhen dekhnaa aapke liye mushkil ho jaataa he
 Also do not believe that this is not true
 fasebuk newsroom nesoshal mediaper phek news ko rokane ke liye sambhavit kadamon ko list kiya he
 Facebook's newsroom says, "the biggest step towards success in this direction is to identify digital spammers that act like a rumor mill
" fasebuk par failaai jane vaali bhraamak soochnaaon ke peeche ek arthshaastra bhi kaam karata he
 If spammers get enough people to click on fake stories and visit their sites, they make big money through the AIDS shown there
 aisa karne ke baad ki is tarah ke ghotaalon ke jariye paise banane kaa scope naa rahe, ham fasebuk par juthi khabaron ko failaane kii unki manshaa ko nasht kar dete hai
 We are identifying commonly used tactics by spammers and reducing the distribution of such stories in news feeds
 ’fasebuk kaa jor dekar kahana he ki wo aise sabhi pejon or websiton ke khilaaf karrwai kar rahaa he jo baar baar farji khabaron ko share karte hai
 By doing so, their entire news feed distribution will be reduced
 farji sandeshon ko agrasaarit karnaa bharat main badi samasya ban gaya he
 The availability of social media platforms has multiplied and increased this problem
 watsapaki taraf se ek apadet par kaam kiya ja rahaa he jisamen forward kiye jane vaale text par ye sheershak hoga ki ye text original nahin he
 Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad believes that after Sachin Tendulkar retires, his memory will be blurred in the memory of the people, as he is retiring at such a time, while the Indian cricket team has some good talent to fill his place
 Huh
 miyandad ne kaha, is kshetra ke cricket premiyon kii prakruti kuch is tarah se he ki yadi koi khilaadi apana antarrashtriya kariyar lanbaa khinchne kii koshish karata he to phir ve uske sanyas lene ke baad jald hi use bhul jate hai
 Tendulkar will retire after the second Test against West Indies starting on Thursday
 yah unka 200waan test match bhi hoga
 Miandad said that he himself tried to prolong his career and it did not prove to be good for him
 unhone kaha, meraa maananaa he ki tendulkar ko pehle sanyas le lenaa chahie tha or vah aise samay main vidaai le rahe hai, jabaki bharat ke paas kuch behad pratibhashali ballebaaj hai, jo ki logon ke maujuuda nayak or adarsh hai
 Miandad said that Tendulkar deserves all kinds of respect and praise before his last match
 unhone kaha, yah dekhnaa acha he
 He deserves such respect and respect as Tendulkar has contributed a lot to Indian cricket over the years and is guaranteed a place among the modern-day star batsmen
 unhone kaha, main cricket khilne vaale sabhi deshon ke yuva cricketron ke liye role model ke rup main unke naam kii sifarish karuunga

 a gang is active in Azamgarh district these days, who steal precious Ashtadhatu idols from thousands of years old temples from temples and sell them in pieces
 pehle yah giroh puri murti sabut hi bechaa karata tha, jise dobaaraa mandir main yah sthapit kar di jaati thi
 Now in the game that is going on, the existence of the entire idol is dying
 murti agar pakadi bhi jaati he, to puri tarah se khandit, jise na to mandir main sthapit kiya ja saktaa he, na hi videshon main antic pis ke rup main koi kharid saktaa he
 Earlier the idol of such idols used to be available
 aise main yah sawaal uthta he ki vah koun-si aisi vajah he, jiske chalate ye taskar ab murtiyon ke tukade karke yaa galaakar baahar bhej rahe he
 Neither the police nor the arrested criminals have the answer
 azamgarh main teen din main pakde gaye do taskaron kii ek 3 kilo vajan kii murti kii keemat 3 karod rupee he
 According to the police, the value of the statue of three kilos and seven hundred grams caught in the international market has been reported to be Rs
3 crore seventy lakhs
 police ne in saare taskaron ko kanoonee karrwai karke jail bhej diya he
 What thinking is hidden behind it, it is difficult to tell right now, which is threatening the existence of the idol from faith
