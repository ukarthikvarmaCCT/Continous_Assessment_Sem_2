 On the one hand, while pregnancy is the most important time of life for every woman, this time is also full of all kinds of complications and apprehensions
 internet par or patr-patrikaon main dheron aise likh mil jaaenge jinamein garbhavastha ko lekar tarah-tarah kii salaah di gai hoti he
 But as much confusions
 aise main jaruri he ki garbhvatee mahila ko pataa ho ki is dauraan kya kuch karnaa uske or uske bachche ke liye behatar hoga or kya nahin
 One of these complications is related to food and drink
 is dauraan kya khaanaa chahie or kya nahin, isaki puri or sahi jaankaree mahila ko honi chahie
 a commonly occurring mother should take all the nutrients necessary for the body in their proper amounts
 taaki hone vaale bachche kaa sampurna vikaas ho sake
 Nevertheless, there are some things that the mother should pay special attention to and avoid: 1
 agar aapako kaccha yaa aadha pakaa anda khaane kii aadat he to garbhavastha main is aadat ko chhod dena hi aapke liye behatar hoga
 Eating a raw or half-cooked egg poses a risk of Salmonella infection
 jisaki vajah se diaria hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 2
 garbhvatee mahila ko sharaab or duusari nashili chizon ke seven se parhez karnaa chahie
 Increased consumption of alcohol also increases the risk of miscarriage
 iske alaava bachche main vikaas se judi kai vikrutiyaan aa jane kaa bhi khatra bad jaataa he
 3
 agar garbhvatee mahila ko coffee pine kii aadat he to use apni is aadat ko niyantrit karnaa chahie
 Coffee contains high amounts of caffeine which increases blood pressure
 isse bachche ke vikaas par bhi vipareet asar padataa he
 4
 garbhavastha ke dauraan papite kaa seven karnaa aapke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 In this also, if papaya is not cooked well, it can prove to be more dangerous
 kachche papite main latex paaya jaataa he jisaki vajah se bhrun ko nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 5
 kachche ankurit anaaj khaanaa bhi garbhvatee mahila ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho saktaa he
 Eating sprouts during pregnancy increases the risk of food poisoning
 ye sthiti garbhvatee ke liye khatarnaak sabit ho sakati he

 Whenever security concerns arise in the sea, the first place that comes to mind is Badhwar Park
 26 / 11 mumbai hamale ke aatanki badhwaar park par hi apni dingi se utar kar shahar main ghuse the or apane napak mansoobon ko anjaam diya tha
 No terrorists should be bribed in the city through the sea, so many security measures schemes have been implemented in the last seven years
 ab ek nai token yojana lagu kii gai he, lekin ye yojana shuru hote hi vivaadon main ghir gai he
 Fishermen have started opposing it
 matsay vibhaag kii taraf se lagu is token yojana ke tahat machuaaron ko har baar samandar main jane se pehle apana naam or pura byoraa form main bhar kar dena he or laut kar aane ke baad phir se suraksha guard ko suchit karnaa he
 Commissioner of Fisheries Department Madhukar Gaikwad says that this is a part of maritime security and through this we will have information about how many fishermen are in the sea and how many have returned, which is very important
 madhukar gayakwad ke mutabik tamilnadu or gujarat me ye token yojana pehle se lagu he
 However, the fisherman disagrees
 machuaaron ke netaa damodar tandel kaa kahana he ki ye suraksha ke naam par chote machuaaron ko pareshaan karne kaa tughluqi farmaan zyada he
 Tandel alleges that the token system has not been implemented on big jetties like Sassoon Dak where there are big fishermen
 or samandar main suraksha kaa kaam matsay vibhaag kaa nahi he
 He belongs to the Navy, Coastguard, Custom and Police
 machuaaron ke mutabik hamen achaanak se machhlee maarane ke liye samandar main janaa padataa he
 But it takes a lot of time to complete the token form
 duusare machhlee pakad kar aane ke baad ham suraksha guard ko jaankaree dene main apana samay gavaayenge to pakadi gai machhlee bazaar kab le jaaenge? He says, sometimes several boats leave at once, or return
 akelaa suraksha guard token kii prakriya puri karne main ghanton lagayegaa to hamaari to machhliyaan hi mar jaaengi
 The comments aapako bataa den ki mumbai or maharashtra ke 720 kilometre lambey samandar kinare par kul 173 landig point hai, lekin abhi sirf 91 plint par hi token vyavastha lagu kii gai he
 The fisheries department has a boat register of a total of 23 thousand fishermen
 jaahir he itani badi sankhya main naavon par najar rakhana tedi kheer he
 In the name of maritime security, many security measures have been taken in the sea in the last seven years
 samandar main gast badhaane se lekar kinaaron par nigaraanee ke liye suraksha tower, machuaaron ke boometric card, har jilon kii naav ke alag color code or ab ye nayaa token system
 But how effective all these things can be gauged from the fact that about 230 of the 450 policemen posted for patrolling in the sea do not know how to swim
 samandar ke raste phir koi aatanki shahar main naa ghoose paae, isliye pichley saat saalon main kai suraksha upaay yojanaayen lagu kii ja chuki hai
 Now a new token scheme has been implemented, but the scheme is mired in controversies as soon as it starts
 machuaaron ne iskaa virodh karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Under this token scheme implemented by the Department of Fisheries, fishermen have to fill their name and full details in the form before going to sea and inform the security guard again after returning
 matsay vibhaag ke ayukta madhukar gayakwad kaa kahana he ki ye samudri suraksha kaa hissaa he or isse hamaare paas samandar main kitne machuaare hai or kitne laut aae hai, isaki jaankaree uplabdh rahegi jo bahut hi ahm he
 According to Madhukar Gaikwad, this token scheme is already in force in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat
 haalanki machuaare isse sahamat nahin he
 Fisherman leader Damodar Tandel says that this is more of a Tughlaki decree to harass small fishermen in the name of security
 tandel kaa aarope he ki sasoon dak jaise bady jettiyon par jahaan bade-bade machuaare hai, vahaan token vyavastha nahin lagu kii gai he
 And the protection of fisheries department is not in the sea
 wo navy, costguard, custom or police kaa he
 According to the fishermen, we suddenly have to go to the sea to kill fish
 lekin token vaala farm bharne ke chakkar main hi kaaphi samay lag jaataa he
 After catching other fish, we will waste our time in giving information to the security guard, so when will the caught fish go to market? vah kehete hai, kabhi-kabhi ek saath kai naav nikalati hai, yaa laut kar aati hai
 If the security guard alone takes hours to complete the token process, then our fish will die
 tippaniyan Let us tell you that there are a total of 173 landing points on the 720 km long seashore of Mumbai and Maharashtra, but only 91 points have been implemented on token system
 matsay vibhaag ke paas kul 23 hajaar machuaaron kii naav register hai
 It is obvious that keeping a watch on such a large number of boats is crooked
 samudri suraksha ke naam par pichley saat varshon main samandar main suraksha ke anekon upaay kiye ja chuke hai
 Security towers ranging from increasing patrols in the sea to security towers, fishermen's biometric cards, different color codes for each district's boat and now this new token system
 lekin ye sab kitna kargar he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki samandar main gast ke liye tainaat 450 police sipaahiyon main se kareeb 230 ko tairnaa hi nahin aata

 lekin ye sab kitna kargar he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki samandar main gast ke liye tainaat 450 police sipaahiyon main se kareeb 230 ko tairnaa hi nahin aata
 Commissioner of Fisheries Department Madhukar Gaikwad says that this is a part of maritime security and through this we will have information about how many fishermen are in the sea and how many have returned, which is very important
 madhukar gayakwad ke mutabik tamilnadu or gujarat me ye token yojana pehle se lagu he
 However, the fisherman disagrees
 machuaaron ke netaa damodar tandel kaa kahana he ki ye suraksha ke naam par chote machuaaron ko pareshaan karne kaa tughluqi farmaan zyada he
 Tandel alleges that the token system has not been implemented on big jetties like Sassoon Dak where there are big fishermen
 or samandar main suraksha kaa kaam matsay vibhaag kaa nahi he
 He belongs to the Navy, Coastguard, Custom and Police
 machuaaron ke mutabik hamen achaanak se machhlee maarane ke liye samandar main janaa padataa he
 But it takes a lot of time to complete the token form
 duusare machhlee pakad kar aane ke baad ham suraksha guard ko jaankaree dene main apana samay gavaayenge to pakadi gai machhlee bazaar kab le jaaenge? He says, sometimes several boats leave at once, or return
 akelaa suraksha guard token kii prakriya puri karne main ghanton lagayegaa to hamaari to machhliyaan hi mar jaaengi
 The comments aapako bataa den ki mumbai or maharashtra ke 720 kilometre lambey samandar kinare par kul 173 landig point hai, lekin abhi sirf 91 plint par hi token vyavastha lagu kii gai he
 The fisheries department has a boat register of a total of 23 thousand fishermen
 jaahir he itani badi sankhya main naavon par najar rakhana tedi kheer he
 In the name of maritime security, many security measures have been taken in the sea in the last seven years
 samandar main gast badhaane se lekar kinaaron par nigaraanee ke liye suraksha tower, machuaaron ke boometric card, har jilon kii naav ke alag color code or ab ye nayaa token system
 But how effective all these things can be gauged from the fact that about 230 of the 450 policemen posted for patrolling in the sea do not know how to swim
 haalanki machuaare isse sahamat nahin he
 Fisherman leader Damodar Tandel says that this is more of a Tughlaqi decree to harass small fishermen in the name of security
 tandel kaa aarope he ki sasoon dak jaise bady jettiyon par jahaan bade-bade machuaare hai, vahaan token vyavastha nahin lagu kii gai he
 And the protection of fisheries department is not in the sea
 wo navy, costguard, custom or police kaa he
 According to the fishermen, we suddenly have to go to the sea to kill fish
 lekin token vaala farm bharne ke chakkar main hi kaaphi samay lag jaataa he
 After catching other fish, we will waste our time in giving information to the security guard, so when will the caught fish go to market? vah kehete hai, kabhi-kabhi ek saath kai naav nikalati hai, yaa laut kar aati hai
 If the security guard alone takes hours to complete the token process, then our fish will die
 tippaniyan Let us tell you that there are a total of 173 landing points on the 720 km long seashore of Mumbai and Maharashtra, but only 91 points have been implemented on token system
 matsay vibhaag ke paas kul 23 hajaar machuaaron kii naav register hai
 It is obvious that keeping a watch on such a large number of boats is crooked

 Before Raj Kapoor, there was no tradition in Bollywood to celebrate Holi in such a grand manner

 Holi used to be so accommodated in RK Studio that everyone used to wait for it all year

 However, there was no conflict between Dev Anand and Raj Kapoor

 Actually, Devuanand was not fond of playing Holi from the beginning

 Raj Kapoor knew this about Dev Anand

 Today is the birth anniversary of Birsa Munda
 adivasee swabhimaan ke nayak, lok devtaa ke rup main sthapit birsa kaa sahitya se naata behad ghanaa he
 Birsa's life struggle affected the entire Indian literature, especially Bangla literature, so that an entire period was filled with an analytical depiction of the tribal community, their lives and movement
 haalanki yah anayas hi nahin hua
 The famous Bengali narrator Mahashweta Devi even mentioned it in her autobiography and wrote that we can see the most terrible face of mental impotence and darkness decay in the seventies by the litterateurs and intellectuals of Bengal
 jahaan desh or manushya raktakt abhigyata main jujh rahe the, vahiin bangala sahitya ek bade gambhir dukh dard ko chhodkar pari desh ke alokik swapn baag main mithyaa phool khilaane kaa 'vyarth' aatmghaatee khel main vyast rahaa gaya tha
 Birsa Munda was born in the year 1875 in Lihatu, Ranchi
 yah kabhi bihar kaa hissaa tha par ab yah jharkhand main aa gaya he
 After his initial studies in Salga village, Birsa Chaibasa came to study at English Middle School
 birsa munda ko apni bhoomi, samskruti se gaharaa lagaav tha
 It is said that when he was studying in his school, the land of Mundas and Munda Sardars was forcibly taken away
 sugana munda or karmi hatu ke putr birsa munda ke man main british sarkaar ke khilaaf yaheen se vidroh panpane laga
 From here Birsa Munda became a supporter of the land movement of the tribals
 unke bhaashanon main, vaad-vivaad main adivaasiyon ke jal, jangal or jameen par haq kii vakaalat badhane lagi
 
 or yaheen se shuru hua unke jivan kaa sangharsh
 Mahasweta Devi wrote the Bengali novel 'aranyar Adhikar' on the same life struggle of Birsa Munda, which was printed in Hindi under the name 'jungle ki Daawadeer'
 mahasweta devi kaa yah upanyaas keval ek saahitiyik, vyaktiparak yaa aitihaasik aakhyaan bhar nahin he, iskaa ek alag mahatva he
 He has also highlighted the hypocrisy of the missionary activities among the helpless tribesmen, how Dr
 Pastret, a pastor, lured people that if he became a Christian and followed his instructions, he would get the shaved land of the shaved chieftains back
 1886 se 1890 tak birsa kaa chibasa mishan ke saath rahanaa unke vyaktitv kaa nirmaan kaal tha
 This was the period which changed within Birsa Munda and created a flame of self-respect
 munda saradaaron ne jab 1886-87 main bhoomi vaapasi kaa andolan kiya, to is andolan ko na keval dabaa diya gaya balki isai mishnariyon ne isaki bhi bhartsana kii
 One of the reasons behind the rebellion of Birsa Munda was the promise and the fraud
 kehete hai birsa ke tewaron ko dekhte hue unhen vidhyalay se nikaal diya gaya
 In 1890 Birsa and his father returned from Chaibasa
 birsa munda par santhal vidroh, chuaar andolan, kol vidroh kaa bhi vyapak prabhaav padaa
 Seeing the plight of his caste, social, cultural and religious identity in danger, a sense of revolution arose in his mind
 unhone man hi man yah sankalp liya ki mundaaon kaa shashan waapas laaenge tathaa apane logon main jagriti paidaa karenge
 'jungle claimant' is the story of this struggle of Birsa and the suppression of the British
 is upanyaas ke bare main likhaa gaya hambihar ke anek jilon ke ghaney jangalon main rahanevaali aadim jatiyon kii anubhutiyon, pura-kathaon or sanathan vishwaason main sijhi sajiv, sachet aasthaa kaa chithran! jangalon kii maan kii tarah puja karanevaale, amaavas kii raat ke andhere se bhi kaale -or prakruti jaise nishpaap- munda, ho, hul, santhal, kol or anya barbar (?), asabhy (?) jatiyon dwaara shoshan ke viruddh or jangal kii milkiyat ke chin liye gaye adhikaron ko waapas lene ke uddeshy se kii gai sashastr kranti kii mahagatha!25 varsh kaa anpadh, angadh birsa unnisvin shatee ke ant main hue is vidroh main sangharshrat logon ke liye ‚Äòbhagwaan‚Äô ban gaya tha - lekin ‚Äòbhagwaan‚Äô kaa yah sambodhan usne sweekaar kiya tha unke jivan main, vyavhaar main, chintan main or aarthik evam raajnneetik paristhitiyon main amul kranti laane ke liye

 Book excerpts: Jungle contenders June 9, 1900
 ranchi kii jail
 At eight in the morning Birsa became unconscious, vomiting blood
 birasa munda- sugana munda kaa betaa; umr pachchis varsh- vichaaradhin bandi
 Birsa was apprehended on 3rd February, but till the last week of that month, a case against Birsa and other shavens was not ready
 us samay munda logon kii ore se barrister jacob lard rahe the
 He is still fighting
 birasa ko pataa tha ki jacob unki ore se ladenge
 Birsa knew that Jacob would not have to fight for her
 criminal proscisger code kii bahut-si dhaaraon main birsa ko pakadaa gaya tha, lekin birsa jaanata tha ki use sajaa nahin hogi
 Bhola Birsa is unaware, but he can see it - one picture after another - everyone can see it
 bhaat munda logon ke jivan main swapn hi bana rahata he
 Ghato is the only food that Munda people get to eat
 isi se bhaat kaa milanaa ek sapana bana rahata he
 In some way or other, the dream of Bhat had kept Birsa's life under control
 adhiktar samay birasa kii joro kii shikaayat rahati he- 'munda keval ghato hi kyon khaaen? diku logon kii tarah ve bhaat kyon na khaaen? or bhaat randha tha, isliye teesri farvari ko birsa pakadaa gaya
 Birsa was sleeping
 aurat bhaat pakaa rahi thi
 Smoke was rising in the blue sky, Birsa was in the lap of sleep; Then people saw the rising smoke
 uske baad banagaanv- uske baad khunty- uske baad ranchi
 Birsa had handcuffs; There were two soldiers on each side
 birasa ke sir par pagadi thi; dhoti pahane tha
 There was nothing else on the body - air and sunshine were piercing the skin simultaneously
 raah ke donon ore log khadey the
 All were shaved
 auraten chaati peet rahi thim; akaash kii ore haath uthaa rahi thim aadmi kah rahe the, 'jinhone tumhen pakadvaaya he, ve magh maheenaa bhi puraa hote na dekh paayenge ve agar jaal failaae rahete hai to us jaal main pakade shikaar ko unhen ghar nahin le jane diya jayega
 'but Birsa will not be angry with them
 pakadava diya; kyon na pakadava dete? dipti kamishnar ne unhen ginakar paanch sau rupye nahin diye kya? paanch sau rupye bahut hote hai! kisi bhi munda ke paas to paanch sau rupye kabhi nahin hue; nahin hote
 If Munda even dreams while sleeping at night, if there is too much in the dream, then he can see the Empress Marka ten rupees
 unhen paanch sau rupye mili hai- kyon na birsa ko pakadava dete?asal main birsa ko apane upar gussa aa rahaa tha
 Why did you sleep? If he could not sleep, he would stay awake
 aag jalaakar bhaat na raandhane detaa
 When the fire is not burning, no smoke rises in the sky, no one can see or know! Birsa was going on in the way while walking - unconscious came to Birsa's mind even this time - he had extinguished that fire, right? Munda people care less
 dhak-dhak jalati aag se jangal jal jaataa he, dawanal laplpaakar fail jaati he, or barason ke liye jangal sookhaa, or bada garam ho jaataa he
 This is why Birsa wanted to burn everything well in 'ulagulan'
 ulgulaan kii aag main jangal nahin jalataa; aadmi kaa rakt or hriday jalataa he! us aag main jangal nahin jalataa! munda logon ke liye jangal nae sire se maan kii tarah ban jaataa he- birasa kii maan kii tarah; jangal kii santaanon ko godi main lekar baithta he
 That is why Birsa wanted the right to the forest! He will take away the forests from the authority of the Daiku people
 jangal munda logon kii maan he or diku logon ne munda logon kii janani ko apavitra kar rakhaa he
 Birsa wanted to cleanse the mother-forest by burning the fire of Ulagulan
 uske baad munda or ho, kol or santhal uraanv logon ne jangal ke swaamitv kaa daawa, chota nagpur ke arany kaa adhikaar, palamu, singhbhum, chakradhrpur- saare jangalon kaa adhikaar chaha tha jisase ve maan kii god main phir se pasar saken
 Birsa understood that now he will leave, because today morning he had done a terrible blood
 achet hote-hote bhi apane khun kaa rang dekhakar birasa mugdh ho gaya tha
 The color of blood is so red! Everyone's blood is red in color; He found it very important and important
 maano yah baat kisi ko bataane kii jarurat thi! kise bataane kii jarurat thi? kise pataa nahin he? amuly ko pataa he, birasa ko maaloom he, munda log jaanate hai
 Sir, people don't know
 jacob jaanata he
 But the jail's superintendent, deputy commissioner - these people don't know
 nahin jaanate- isliye na ve log fouj kii tukdi, or bandook, or top lekar langoti lagaae tir-barchaa-baloya or pathar kaa sahaara lenevaale munda logon ko maarane aae the
 If Birsa could have spoken, he would have said- 'sir! There is no difference in the color of blood
 maarane par jitani tumko chot lagati he, munda logon ko bhi utani hi lagati he
 You have forcibly acquired authority over the lives of Munda people
 us adhikaar ko chhodane main tumko jaisaa lagata he, jangal kii aabaad jameen ko diku logon ke haathon main dete munda logon ko bhi vaisaa hi lagata he
 'but Birsa could not say anything
 vah ankhen nahin khol paata he -kisi ne andar jaise mahua ke tel kii mashaal or dhibree buja di ho! jaise koi birasa ko hilaa rahaa he! kah rahaa he: so jaao, so jaao, so re

 Seeing Kiran sitting in the first line of PM enclosure, the Aam Aadmi Party questioned
 party netaa ashish khetaan ne kaha ki 'bijepi ne apni vaicharik diwaliyapan kaa parichay diya he
 By keeping his CM candidate Kiran Bedi at the forefront and not even inviting Arvind Kejriwal
 ' But, from Kiran Bedi's answer, it seems that she is not giving much priority to this issue
 kiran bedi ne kaha ki 'ab meri kursi kaa faisla bhi wo karenge kya? wo piem kaa block tha, main baith gai, baat khatm, wo faisla kyon karenge ki main kis seat par baithun
 ' darasal, aam aadmi party ke netaa or dilli ke mukhyamantri rah chuke arvind kejariwal ko ganatantr diwas samaaroh ke liye nyotaa tak nahin gaya
 While he himself wanted to go into it
 shanivaar ko arvind kejariwal ne enditivi india se baat karte hue kaha tha ki 'main 26 janvari ganatantr diwas samaaroh main janaa chahta tha, lekin mujhe bulaayaa hi nahin gaya
 ' hairaani kii baat yah he ki jab kiran bedi se is bare main poocha gaya to unka taka sa jawaab tha ki agar kejariwal bijepi main hote to unhen nyotaa mil jaataa, haalanki baad main wo apni baat sanbhaalane kii koshish karti dikhin or kaha ki 'nyote maange nahin jate wo milte or kejariwal ko thodi macurity dikhaane kii zarurat he
 Bedi also objected that Kejriwal put his poster behind the auto without asking him and used the word opportunistic for him
 kiran banaam kejariwal kii ladaai main rose kuch nayaa dekhne ko mil rahaa he aise main aaj kya ho rahaa he, dekhie or kal jo hone vaala he uskaa intazaar kariye

 The 'sadbhavana Committee' of ministers constituted by the government on the initiative of the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) to investigate the communal riots in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, in its report, claimed that the madrasas were trying to fulfill their own interests
 The reason is not to let the displaced people return to their villages
 mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav or mulaayam singh yadav ko saunpi gai report main kaha gaya he ki danga peediton ke liye banaae gaye zyaadaatar raahat shivi madrason main chal rahe hai
 In the name of relief, they are being provided help in the form of food and money from outside
 aise main ve apane nijee laabhon ke liye visthapit logon ko apane gaanv waapas nahin jane dena chaahate, taaki raahat shivi band nahin hon
 It is worth mentioning that at the instance of the SP chief, a goodwill committee of 10 ministers was constituted under the leadership of senior cabinet minister Shivpal Singh Yadav to monitor the situation of the riot victims in Muzaffarnagar and restore confidence in the communities
 mujffarnagar main gat 7 sitambar ko bhadke dangon ke dauraan apana ghar-baar chhodkar bhaage logon ko aasraa dene ke liye mujffarnagar main 41 tathaa shamali main 17 raahat shivi banaae gaye the
 More than 40 thousand people were living in them
 gaanvon ke daure ke aadhaar par taiyaar report main kaha gaya he ki shamali jile ke malakapur kaa shivi van vibhaag kii jameen par kabja karke bana he
 The displaced people living here have been tricked, saying that the land will be allotted in their name if it is occupied, so people are not ready to leave the camp
 report ke anusaar gaanvon main liye gaye karj kii jabaran vasuuli kaa dar bhi logon ko roak rahaa he
 On returning back to the village, some people are afraid of security and some are forced to write forcibly in the cases
 aise logon ko suraksha muhaiyaa karaane kii jarurat bataai gai he
 The Sadbhavana Committee has suggested making three categories of victims, recommending taking various steps to send the riot victims to the village
 ek shrenee aise gaanvon ke visthapiton kii hogi jahaan hinsa nahin hui
 In the second category, there will be villages where violence has taken place, but no loss of life
 teesri aise gaanvon kii jahaan hinsa main dhan-jan kii haani hui he
 For villages with both types of losses, the committee says that the displaced should be sent back only after conducting a special campaign by constituting a peace committee

 bachche ko tyaagane kaa faisla mata-pita donon ne milakar hi liya tha
 During the interrogation, the accused father said that when his wife was pregnant for the fourth time, his friends and relatives started making fun of him for having children repeatedly
 isliye samaaj main sharmindagi se bachane ke liye donon ne milakar bachche se nijaat paane kaa faisla kiya
 However, the couple could not escape the embarrassment

 In a harshly written letter to Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth, the Commission expressed its unhappiness over the timing of the announcement of the scheme by the government
 ayog ne kaha he ki gujarat chunaav ko dekhte huye ise roka ja saktaa tha
 The Election Commission has sought a response from the government on this issue by Monday evening
 ayog kaa kahana he ki agar sarkaar aisa nahin kar paati he to vah maamle main uchit kadam uthaayegaa
 The matter was raised by the BJP last week
 chunaav ayog ke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki hamane cabinet sachiv se is maamle main somvaar shaam tak tathyaatmak report pesh karne ke liye kaha he
 If we do not get an answer, we will take action

 unhone kaha tha ki nakadi hastantaran yojana kii ghoshnaa huyi he, jin rajyon main chunaav hone hai unhen is yojana se baahar rakhaa ja saktaa tha
 The government should not have done this during the election code of conduct
 gujarat main 13 or 17 disambar ko chunaav hone hai or rajya main aachaar samhita lagu he
 Chidambaram first denied the opposition's charge that the plan was to bribe the people, given the possibility of mid-term elections

 He claimed that 'this scheme will prove to be a change for the common people of India' and its benefits will be long lasting
 gramin vikaas mantri jairam ramesh ne bhi kaha tha ki yah yojana 2009 main chunaav ke pehle kiya gaya vaayada he jo ab puraa ho gaya he
 The BJP has rejected the government's argument that no ruling party can provide financial support in any form during the code of conduct

 Kangana's look and her voice are playing the role of Lakshmibai in the film
 trailor main unke kaam ko lekar mili juli pratikriya he
 There are three parts of his character as the princess, wife and queen
 lakshmibai ek yoddha bhi thim
 It has to be seen how much she influences as a warrior with her personality and voice
 kyonki trailor main aawaaj ke fark ko lekar unpar andeh bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Although the makers have used technology for this, there is a difference of two types in the voice used in the film somewhere on Kangana's personality
 saamaanya baatcheet kii style main unki aawaaj behatar he, par jab wo chillaati hai to aawaaj main kaaphi fark dikhataa he
 If this difference is seen more in the film then the mood of the audience will deteriorate
 yahaan dekhen film kaa trailor # 3
 The action sequence is a period drama by Manikarnika
 aisi filmon ke apane khatre hote hai
 Kangana in the role of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi impresses in many scenes
 period drama main parade par agar chijen us deshkal ko lekar saamne nahin aati to darshakon kaa dhyaan bhatakta he
 By the way a lot of money has been spent on the sets of the film
 lekin ye dekhne vaali baat hogi ki parde par dikhaae gaye drishy kitne asli or prabhavi banenge
 If things are lacking then the word of mouth will be bad about the film
 bataane kii jarurat nahin ki aajkal filmon ke kaarobaar par verde of mouth kaa kitna asar pad saktaa he
 However, despite all the flaws, the story of Rani of Jhansi has so much power that Kangana's needs can be fulfilled at the box office
 desh ke teen alag-alag mizaaj vaale rajyon main chunavi ghamaasan machaa hua he
 In Maharashtra, the Marathi issue dominates in Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh
 desh kii raajnneetik partiyaan matadaataaon ko rijhaane main lagi hui hai
 Let's know about some big parties of the country - Congress is the oldest political party in the history of independent India
 mahatma gandhi kii hatya or sardaar patel ke nidhan ke baad jawaharlal nehru ke karishmai netritv main party ne pehle sansadeey chunaavon main shandaar safalataa pai or ye silsilaa 1967 tak anwarat chalata rahaa
 In the 1952, 1957 and 1962 Lok Sabha elections led by Nehru, the Congress won a majority on its own
 varsh 1964 main jawaharlal nehru ke nidhan ke baad bahadur shastri ke haathon main kaman saunpi gai, lekin unki bhi 1966 main taashkand main sandehaaspad sthitiyon main maut ho gai
 After this, Congress took the reins of Indira Gandhi
 1977 main jab chunaav hue to janata party ke haathon congress ko buree haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa haalanki do varshon main hi ye sarkaar gir gai or 1980 main indira gandhi phir satta main lautin
 After the assassination of Indira Gandhi in the year 1984, her son Rajiv Gandhi took charge of the party and in the elections of 84, the party achieved huge success
 1989 main jab chunaav hue to janata dal or bhaajapa ke gathjod ne congress ko parajeet kar diya
 However, this government too could last only two years
 1991 main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan hi rajeev gandhi kii bhi bam visphot main maut ho gai or party kii kaman pivi narsingh raav ke haathon me di gai
 Congress got 232 seats in this election
 iske baad congress kaa janaadhar lagataar girtaa gaya
 In the 1984 elections, the Congress had got 404 seats, which was reduced to 114 in 1999
 haalanki 2004 ke chunaavon main congress ko 145 siten milin or 2009 main congress jab phir se satta main lauti to uske paas 206 saansad thea
 The BJP family formed the Bharatiya Jan Sangh in 1951 as a political wing
 doctor shyama prasad mukherjee iske netaa bane
 In the first general elections held this year, Jana Sangh got the status of national party
 baad ke varshon main vamapanthiyon ke saath milakar jan sangh ne kai rajyon main satta main ai
 The Jan Sangh reorganized itself in the year 1980 after a split with the Janata Party
 janata party main shaamil iske netaa ek manch par aae or nai party bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) kaa gathan hua
 The BJP won two seats in the 1984 elections, but in 1989, it won 89 seats due to the alliance with the Janata Dal
 1990 main bhaajapa ne ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar andolan tej kar diya
 The party's leader Lal Krishna Advani started the Rath Yatra which gave the party immense popularity
 1991 ke chunaavon main party ne 120 siton par safalataa hasil kii
 However, after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992, he was accused of promoting communal politics and was dismissed in four states
 dilli main bhaajapa kii pehali sarkaar varsh 1996 main bani lekin atal bihari vaajapeyi sabase kam dinon ke pradhanmantri sabit hue
 They could not muster majority and the government fell in just 13 days
 96 ke chunaavon main party ko 161 siten mili thim
 After this, the party won 182 seats in 1998
 isi samay rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan yani endie kaa swaroop saamne aayaa
 Samata Party, AIADMK, Shiv Sena, Akali Dal and Biju Janata Dal joined the government
 telugudesham party ne ise baahar se samarthan diya
 But this government also could run only for 13 months and the government collapsed due to withdrawal of AIADMK support
 thik ek saal baad hue loksabhaa chunaavon main bhaajapa kii aguai main endie phir satta main ai or vaajapeyi teesri baar pradhanmantri bane
 This government lasted for full five years but in the Lok Sabha elections held in 2004, the key to power again went to the Congress
 2009 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bhi bhaajapa or uske sahyogiyon ko haar kaa samaanaa karnaa padaa
 Bahujan Samaj Party Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is a national party formed in the year 1984 by the charismatic Dalit leader Kanshi Ram
 filhal uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati is party kii adhyaksh hai or uttar pradesh hi party kaa garh he
 Elephant is the election symbol of the party
 bahujan samaaj party pehali baar 1984 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main utari lekin koi safalataa hasil nahin kar saki
 In the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, two party members went to the Lok Sabha and after that the party did not have to look back
 jab desh main gathbandhan kii raajnneeti ne apana sikaa jamaaya to bahujan samaaj party kaa bhi rang nikharaa or varsh 1995 aate-aate ye party bharat ke sabase bade rajya uttar pradesh main satta ke shikhar tak pahunch gai or party ne gathbandhan sarkaar kaa netritv kiya
 In the 13th Lok Sabha, 14 Lok Sabha members of this party were elected
 party ne varsh 1989 main pehali baar uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main hissaa liya or 13 vidhayak chune gaye, lekin jab varsh 1991 main chunaav hue to party kii seat ghatakar 12 ho gai
 In both the year 1993 and 1996, 67 mlas reached the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, 98 in 2002 and 206 in 2007
 is bich party ne teen baar rajya main gathbandhan sarkaar kaa netritv kiya
 While formed the government in 2007 with an absolute majority
 is party kii pahchaan ek dalit party ke taur par hoti he lekin party adhyaksh mayawati paroksh rup se ye ghoshnaa kar chuki hai ki wo daliton ko satta main bhagidaari dilaane ke liye kuch bhi kar sakati hai
 This is the reason that the party has changed its strategy significantly and the party which once held a strong attitude against the upper castes is now close to the Brahmins
 marxvaadi communist partibharat main philhal pashchim bengal, kerala or tripura main marxvaadi communist party (sipiem) sabase zyaada asardaar he
 The CPM was formed in 1964 by the split of the Communist Party of India (CPI)
 1967 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main sipiem ko 19 seat mili or sipiai ko 23 siton par safalata hasil hui
 The CPM emerged as the single largest party in the assembly elections in Kerala and West Bengal
 1971 ke loksabhaa chunaav main sipiem ko 25 siten milin jinamein se 20 pashchim bengal se ai

 unhone kaha ki 'vaarta par hamaare paksh kii buniyadi sweekruti kii jarurat he, jiske antargat yah sweekaar karnaa he ki yahaan vivaad he or ise sulajhane kii jarurat he'
 However, the separatists certainly agreed to support serious negotiations under the principles to end the conflict in the valley

 Pramod Krishnam said that CBI and ED should give full opportunity against Chidambaram, so that milk becomes milk and water of water
 jail jane ke dar se itane bade netaaon ko roj-roj adaalat ke saamne gidgidaana shobhaa nahin detaa
 Against Chidambaram, the CBI and ED should give full "chance", so that milk becomes milk and water, the "fear" of going to jail does not "suit" such "big" leaders, every day in front of the court 
 ‚Äî Acharya Pramod (@acharyapramodk)august 26, 2019isse pehle, pi

 The bench said, "there are some hurdles in the registry and they have to take orders from the Chief Justice
 " solisitor general tushaar mehta ne kaha ki unhen yachika par sunwaayee se koi aapatti nahin he
 Let us know that in the INX Media case, the Delhi High Court on August 21 rejected Chidambaram's anticipatory bail plea

 bijepi netaa narendra modi ne ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar ko ek chaalaak netaa qaraar diya or kaha ki kendriya mantri ne is baar loksabhaa chunaav na ladane kaa faisla isliye kiya he ki kyonki unhen andaja ho gaya tha ki vah chunaav haar jaaenge
 Addressing a rally here, Modi said, whenever people talk about Sharad Pawar, they call him a clever leader
 ab mujhe samaj main aa gaya ki log unhen chaalaak netaa kyon kehete hai
 He got an idea of which side of the wind is coming
 lihaaja, unhone is baar chunaav na ladane kaa faisla kiya taaki unhen haar kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 Significantly, Pawar, who has won the Lok Sabha elections several times, has been elected to the Rajya Sabha in the past
 modi jalgaanv seat se bhaajapa ke ummidavaar e tii naanaa patil or raver seat se party kii ummidavaar raksha khadse ke liye prachaar karne aae the

 Targeting senior Congress leaders, Modi said, "all the Congress leaders who have been seen on TV for the last 10 years are now running away from elections
" kuch to apana namakan-patr daakhil karne ke baad bhaag khadey hue
 He said, he had forgotten the tribals and Dalits during the 50 years of Congress rule

 Targeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Modi said, PMO told the media that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has given 1,100 speeches in the last 10 years
 kya 1,100 baar bolnaa pradhanmantri ke liye uplabdhi he? yuvaaon se apil karte hue modi ne kaha, 18-28 aapaki svarnim umr he
 Not a single day should be wasted

 In 2009, 100 incidents of attacks on Indian students were reported in Australia
 madhya pradesh kirajdhani bhopalka namakaran raja bhoj ke naam par ‚Äòbhopal‚Äô karne ke prayaason kaa kadaa virodh karte hue congress ne chetavanee di he ki yadi aisa hua to andolan kiya jayega
 State Congress spokesperson Arif Masood told reporters that if Bhopal was named Bhojpal, then agitation will be organized against it
 unhone daawa kiya ki unki jaankaree ke anusaar rajya sarkaar raja bhoj ke naam par bhopal kaa naam badalakar ‚Äòbhopal‚Äô karnaa chaahati he
 He asked the government, which king banquets are this one thousand years old, which are being mentioned through big hoardings, advertisements and newspapers
 pradesh congress pravaktaa ne kaha ki unki apni jaankaree ke anusaar jin raja bhoj ne bhopal kaa talab banwaaya or bhopal shahar basaaya tha, unka kalkhand lagbhag 1430 varsh purana he
 In this, he cited some ancient texts and claimed that there have been about fourteen kings in history
 masood ne kaha ki bhopal kaa ek sunaharaa itihaas rahaa he or uskaa naam duniya ke har kone main janaa jaataa he
 Instead of changing the name of the city, he suggests that the government can name its schemes after 'raja Bhoj'
 agra main manaae jane vaale ‚Äòtaj utsav‚Äô kii tarah yahaan ‚Äòbhoj utsav‚Äô manaaya ja saktaa he, jise bhopal ke sabhi dharm evam samaaj milakar manaaen tathaa yahaan kii ‚Äòganga-jamuni tahjeeb‚Äô kii misaal pesh karen
 On the other hand, the Communist Party of India has also issued a statement here today opposing efforts to change the name of Bhopal
 party ke rajya sachiv shailendra kumaar style ne apil karte hue kaha he ki is prayaas ke virodh main sabhi loktantric evam dharmanirpeksh mulyon main vishwaas rakhane vaale log lamaband hon
 Praising feudal values of any kind is fatal to democracy
 unhone aise kisi bhi prayaas ke khilaaf andolan kii chetavanee di he
 The Pilibhit scandal played such a spin of politics that Varun has become a hero of the BJP
 bhaajapa ke bade netaa varun kii peeth thapthapaane main jute hai, to kaaryakarta chunavi reliyon main varun kii maang kar rahe hai
 The fire-breathing tongue has increased his stature so much that BJP workers are everywhere chanting Varun and Varun
 chunaav prachaar ke liye sabko varun chahie, chaahe vah pilibhit ho yaa fir raipur
 The BJP has made full preparations to take political advantage of his arrest
 is siyaasi drame ne varun kaa bazaar bhav kaafii upar pahunchaa diya he
 The BJP, which was earlier avoiding Varun's poisonous speech, is busy fielding strongly in support of Varun
 yah bijepi main narendra modi kii badhati haisiyat kaa ek or sanket tha
 It was a mere formality when party president Rajnath Singh went to meet 85-year-old LK Advani on the morning of March 31, before announcing his team of new party officials
 adwani bhale hi is nai team se khush nahin the, lekin ve kuch kar bhi nahin sakate the
 Gujarat Chief Minister Modi had already confirmed it and Rajnath had decided to go to his court
 party ke ek padaadhikari ne bataaya, ''adwani ji bebas the
 He asked Rajnath to do as he deems fit
 ‚Äù adwani gujarat ke purv mantri or hatya ke aaropee or chargeshited amit shah ko party mahasachiv banaae jane ke khilaaf the
 He said that this would spoil the party's image among the common people and the Congress would get the weapon to attack the BJP
 lekin modi apane is vafaadaar ko rashtriya team main laane par ade the
 Therefore Advani did not have one
 ve party main vito lagane kaa apana adhikaar kho chuke the
 Advani's position has become so weak that he failed to bring Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan along with Modi to the party's parliamentary board
 modi kii hi tarah chouhan ko bhi acha kaam karne vaala mukhyamantri mana jaataa he
 Rajnath said that Modi has huge support from the party cadres and Chauhan is yet to show his hold for the third time in Madhya Pradesh
 iske vipareet modi gujarat main lagaataar teesri baar apni satta banaae rakhane main kaamyaab rahe hai
 Advani was also not in favor of Dharmendra Pradhan and J
 pi
 Nadda should be made the General Secretary of the party
 pradhan chunaav ke maddenjar karnataka ke prabharee hai to nadda himachal pradesh ke
 Advani believed that he should focus on his states
 lekin rajnath unhen baahar nahin rakh sake, kyonki rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali ne in donon kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Advani is believed to have told a senior party leader that the members of the team were chosen not on the basis of their merit but because of being close to some leaders
 modi-jetali kii jodi itani taqatvar he ki bijepi adhyaksh ke liye unki andekhi karnaa mushkil he
 By marginalizing Advani, Rajnath has also managed to please the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the core of the party's ideology
 adwani ke liye sandesh spasht he
 The center of power in the BJP has changed with Modi's entry into the Central Parliamentary Board and Central Election Committee, the largest decision making unit
 party ke varisht netaa kehete hai ki may main karnataka main chunaav ke baad bijepi jo chunaav prachaar samiti banaaegi, uskaa netritv modi ke haath main ja saktaa he
 Modi's seal on Rajnath's team is just beginning
 smriti irani ko upaadhyaksh or minakshi lekhi ko pravaktaa banane ke peeche bhi modi kii hi ichha thi
 But sources close to Rajnath Singh say that Modi has had no hand in forming a new team
 party adhyaksh ke ek sahyogi kehete hai, ''amit shah ko isliye shaamil kiya gaya kyonki ve party ke liye bahut moolyawaan hai
 He is a very clever leader and specializes in election strategy
 rajya (gujarat) main unke khilaaf mukademe lambit hone se unka upyog nahin ho paa rahaa tha
 So the party decided to use them for the 2014 general elections
 ‚Äù hindutv ke prati jhukaav rakhane ke kaaran bhi shah ko aresas ke aadmi raamalaal kaa samarthan mila
 Ramlal is the organization's general secretary in the party's national team
 sutron kaa daawa he ki aresas ne uma bharti ko upaadhyaksh or varun gandhi ko mahasachiv banane kaa samarthan kiya tha or apni manjuuri di thi
 Incidentally, Advani also suggested Bharti's name, but she was elected due to the wishes of Rajnath and the RSS
 aresas kaa haath maane jane vaale or swadeshi jaagran manch ke purv kaaryakarta muralidhar raav ke maamle main bhi aisa hi hua
 He was made the General Secretary
 adwani ke pasandida balbir punj aresas or modi ke saath acha sameekaran rakhane ke kaaran hi upaadhyaksh kaa pad paane main kaamyaab rahe
 Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj, who has been trying to forge new relations with the RSS, keeping her old loyalty to Advani, has failed to impress the new powers of the BJP
 unke or modi ke bich khatas party main kisi se bhi chuphi nahin he
 She wanted party spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain to be made the general secretary, but Rajnath did not agree to it
 ve sirf es
 s
 ahaluwalia ko hi upaadhyaksh banane ke liye raji hue taaki alpsankhyakon ko behatar pratinidhitiv diya ja sake
 Sushma Swaraj managed to get Poonam Mahajan a secretary in the name of giving women Kota and some representation to Maharashtra, while Rajnath not only excluded most of the people in his predecessor Nitin Gadkari's team, but the former president's favorite Vinay Sahasrabuddhe was also not included
 bharti or varun jaise logon ko mahatv dene ke saath hindutv ko bal mila he or isse bijepi ke ve netaa naaraaz ho gaye hai jinke bare main mana jaataa he ki ve narampanthi hai
 Ravi Shankar Prasad is one of those leaders
 unhen mahasachiv or mukhya pravaktaa, donon hi padon se hataa diya gaya he
 Ravi Shankar Prasad, a member of ABVP, the student wing of the party, has been presenting a progressive picture of the party
 yahi nahin, unhen adwani kaa kareebi mana jaataa tha
 Similarly, senior leaders Yashwant Sinha and Jaswant Singh have also been given no importance
 lekin rajnath ke samarthakon kaa maananaa he ki sabake saath insaaf kiya gaya he
 Sources close to Rajnath reveal that in view of the current situation, he has tried to do the best work for his side
 nai team banaate samay unhone sabhi netaaon kaa dhyaan rakhaa
 Eighty percent of the leaders in the 76-member team are under 60 years old
 party ke pravaktaa prakaash javdekar bachaav main kehete hai, ''nai team main ek sangathit bijepi kii tasviir dikhaai detii he, kyonki isamen sabhi kshetron, saamaajik samoohon ko shaamil kiya gaya he or mahilaon ko pehle se zyada pratinidhitiv diya gaya he
 Not only this, qualification is taken care of in the new team
 ‚Äùnai team taiyaar karne main jis tarah modi samarthakon or unase acha sambandh rakhane waalon ko tarjeeh di gai he, usase lagata he ki party main modi kaa varchasv kaayam ho gaya he
 Some people within the party are questioning Modi as a possible prime ministerial candidate
 party ke ek varisht netaa party kii isi duvidha ko jaahir karte hue kehete hai, ''modi bhale hi party main sabase yogya vyakti hon, lekin unhen pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaaya gaya to kya gathbandhan ke sahyogi unka samarthan karenge? ve party ke sabase kaabil netaa bhale hi hon, lekin gathbandhan main ve sabase kam sweekaarya vyakti hai
 "but supporters of the Chief Minister of Gujarat believe that it is a wise decision to Modiize the BJP just before the general elections
 unka kahana he ki modi ko sirf hindutv kaa cheharaa maananaa galat he
 Says a leader close to Modi, "he is a symbol of development, with its all-india appeal
" ‚Äù vishwa hindu parishad ke netaa ashok sinhal ne haal hi main modi kii lokapriyata kii tulana jawaharlal nehru se kii thi
 Sources say that Modi is slowly but steadily building his image
 ve upie sarkaar main bhrashtachar or mahangaai jaise muddon par centre sarkaar kii vifaltaa kaa laabh uthaate hue kisi tarah ke bhedbhaav ke bina vikaas kii baat karte hai or saath hi hindu votaron ko vishwaas dilaate hai ki party alpsankhyakon ko khush karne vaala koi kadam nahin uthaaegi, balki iske khilaaf ladegi
 But not all people feel right to promote Hindutva indirectly by promising to fight against decisions that appease the minorities
 bijepi ke ek yuva netaa kehete hai, ''ab samay aa gaya he ki party ko hindutv se rashtrawaad kii ore baduya chahie
 If we want to form the NDA government in 2014, it should be the basis of nationalism, good governance and development
 hindutv kaa pallu pakadaaey se hamen abhi aage kai or varshon tak vipaksh main hi baithna pad saktaa he

 vahiin duusari taraf desh main aisi bhi panchayatein hai jo talibani farmaan sunaane ke liye khud katghare main khadi dikhti hai
 One such case has come up from Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh
 bulandshahr jile ke prahadpur gaanv ke rahane vaale ek shaks kaa daawa he ki use or uski do maah kii garbhvatee patni ko alamgirpur dhanora gaanv kii panchayat nazinda jaladene kaa farmaan sunaaya he
 The man named Ravindra says that his wife is being held hostage in his house by his father
 ravindra ke mutabik wo or uski patni donon balig or shikshit hai or donon ne is saal 15 march ko greater noida main arya samaaj mandir main shaadi kii thi
 Then the official registration of this wedding in Bulandshahr was also done
 ravindra kaa daawa he ki uski patni ke gharavaale is shaadi se khush nahin the
 On May 18, the girl's father was seduced and took her to his home
 unhone ye kaha tha ki donon kii shaadi hindu rivaaj se sabake saamne karai jaaegi, phir donon ke saath rahane par unhen koi aitraaj nahin hoga
 Ravindra first sent a letter to the SSP of Bulandshahr on 19 May expressing his grief in the matter
 ravindra ne phir 21 may ko prashasan-police ke saath hi lakhanu tak chitthee bhejkar insaaf kii maang kii
 In this letter, Ravindra claimed that his wife wants to live with him but his family is holding him hostage
 ravindra ne chitthee main ye bhi kaha ki use ye dhamkee di ja rahi he ki usne police main jane kii koshish kii to use patni samet jinda jala diya jayega
 Ravindra claimed that a decree has also been issued from the panchayat in this regard
 jahaan tak ladki ke gharavaalon kaa maamla he to wo is sambandh main baat karne ke liye saamne aane se inkaar kar rahaa he
 At the same time, Himanshu, the head of Alamgirpur Dhanaura village, was approached, he refused to issue any such decree on behalf of the panchayat
 himanshu ne phone par gaanv se baahar hone kii baat kahi
 Himanshu, on the contrary, described Ravindra as the person of suspicious conduct
 is bare main jab bulandshahr ke espi dehaat jagadish sharma se jab jaankaree leni chaahi to unka jawaab tha ki ek shaks se shikaayat mili he
 The truth is being investigated
 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar jiesti par centre sarkaar kii aalochana se chintit hai
 Fed up with the negative news on this issue, Nitish held a meeting on Friday and gave many instructions
 nitish ne adhikariyon ke saath GST par ek samiksha baithak kii
 He asked the state government officials to pay more attention to publicity
 unhone kaha ki is mudde par jo kilaaf main prachaar ho rahaa hai, usase nibatane ke liye logon kii shikayaton kaa nivaaran karnaa chahie
 Although this meeting was called to discuss its impact on the state's revenue after the implementation of GST, but how to deal with the negative publicity that is happening in the future regarding GST has become a major issue
 nitish kumaar ne phir doharaaya ki jiesti ek acchhee kar vyavastha hai jiskaa bihar jaise rajyon ke upar acha asar padegaa
 Nitish hopes that the GST will be increased by several thousand crores from the tax applicable to the state
 tippaniyan Although in this meeting Mojud Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi said that now the number of complaints related to this is getting ten percent but the meeting added on the need to resolve the problem related to the return filing

 He also said that states will not face any problem due to GST compensation
 haalanki ye baithak jiesti lagu hone ke baad rajya ke rajasav par uske asar par charchaa ke liye bulaayi gayi thi lekin bhavishya main jiesti ke sambandh main jo nakaaratmak prachaar ho rahaa he, usase kaise nibata jaae ye mukhya mudda ho gaya

 The Reserve Bank Governor Urjit Patel and the Finance Ministry were asked several important questions on the demonetization decision by the Public Accounts Committee
 in sawaalon kaa jawaab dene ke liye unhen 20 janvari 2017 tak kaa samay diya he
 This committee of Parliament wanted to know from the Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance, when, how and by whom the decision of demonetisation was taken
 in sawaalon ke jawaab ke liye rigerv bank ne sansadeey samiti ke liye ek note taiyaar kiya tha
 In this note, the entire situation of taking the decision of demonetisation was revealed
 ajanotbandike ek saal puure ho chuke hai
 So know what was the reasoning behind the decision of the Reserve Bank to assess how well it met its logic
 janienotbandeepar sansadeey samiti ke sawaalon rigerv bank kaa jawaab:1
 The decision of demonetisation was a joint decision of both the Central Government and the Reserve Bank, which closed the 500 and 1000 rupee currency prevalent in the economy
 2
 The most important reason behind the decision of demonetisation was to completely stop the communication of fake currency in the country
 3
 The Reserve Bank wanted a new currency of 5000 and 10,000 rupees to be exchanged instead of 500 and 1000 rupees
 is aashay rigerv bank ne kendra sarkaar ko oktober 2014 main salaah di thi
 4
 2000 rupee kii nai karency ke sanchaar ko desh main mahangaai dekhte hue chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the closure of the old currency from this new currency was in the interest of currency communication in the economy
 5
 The Reserve Bank has said that the new currency of 2000 rupees to attract the attention of the common man, hence the decision was taken along with demonetisation and communication of this new currency
 6
 The Reserve Bank has stated that the printing press was instructed in June 2016 to print a series of new currency of 2000 rupees
 7
 After the commencement of printing of new currency from June 2016, the Reserve Bank said that a sufficient amount of stock was ready, so on November 7, 2016, the Central Government wrote a letter to the Reserve Bank, after which the Reserve Bank's Central on November 8, 2016 The board held a meeting and on the same day, the gadget notification was issued for the note ban
 8
 Prior to the announcement of demonetisation, the Reserve Bank was aware that it is not possible to completely replace the old currency
 saath hi bank ke sangyaan main tha ki die gaye samay main nai karency ke vailu or wolum ko puraani karency ke baraabar karne ke kaam ko nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 9
 rigerv bank ko bharosa tha ki digital pement kaa vikalp karency badalane kii prakriya main sahaayak hoga
 This will reduce the pressure of demand for new currency in the economy
 10
 The entire demonetization process will not have any impact on the Reserve Bank's balance sheet

 My partner Tejas said, no all the utensils in the house are empty
 unase bhi bhukhe bacchon ke halaat dekhe naa gaye
 They have moved forward with some help
 hamane milakar kuch madad kii yojana bhi banaai
 But questions kept arising in our mind that we have reached one house, but what about the rest? What will happen by eradicating the hunger of just one house, when the whole area is in the grip
 din bhar ye kahani pareshaan karti rahi
 By the evening, i was convinced that the killing of farmers in Maharashtra was done in a thoughtful way
 
 
 or ho rahaa he
 Governments already know how Marathwada is taking the form of barren area
 beete saal indian science krongress hui to ham bhi shirkat karne pahunche
 We had asked the meteorologists whether the thirst of Marathwada and Vidarbha would be quenched
 tab vaigyanikon ne kaha tha ki ye mumkin nahin he
 This region is facing a variety of shade and changing weather
 tab hamane sawaal poocha tha ki kya sarkarein jaanati hai ye sab? tab pataa chalaa ki hukmaranon ko to arase se pataa he ki marathavada main kya hone ja rahaa he? to sawaal uthta he ki jab sattadhariyon ko maaloom he ki sookhaa to hoga hi, phir beete 20 saal main koi kadam kyon nahin uthaaya? jawaab netaa naa dena chahen
 But the truth is that the leaders of Maharashtra have allowed this to happen
 soche samajhe dhang se kisaanon kaa katl hua he ab isamen koi shaq nahin he
 Most of the irrigation plans made in 20 years were diverted to West Maharashtra
 jo bachi hui yojanaayen vidarbha or marathavada ko milin unamem itnaa bhrashtachar hua ki nahar or baandh kaagaj par hi banate bigadate rahe
 The leaders who handled the irrigation department in the last decade were from western Maharashtra
 unhone pani ke bantwaare ke saare plan pehle apane ilaake ke liye banaae
 The comments marathavada ke kuch ati pichde ilaakon ke log apni bebasii ke dinon main palaayan karte hai or mazaduri karte hai
 These workers are consumed in Western Maharashtra
 kya aise main koi shaq bachataa he ki maharashtra ke ek ilaake ke bade netaa duusare ilaake ke logon ko garib kyon rakhana chaahate hai? kya asantulit vikaas jaanboojhkar nahin kiya ja rahaa? Every month, 69 farmers are committing suicide in Marathwada
 
 
 or ye sab isliye ho rahaa he kyonki asantulit vikaas karke ek kism kii araajaktaa rajya ne paidaa kii he
 Where the crop is dependent on the kindness of the weather, irrigation water and the rest of the development is in the hands of the leaders, does not the common farmer feel helpless and helpless? Does not this helplessness make him to drink poison? Is not the situation similar to those who flee Syria to avoid death, knowing that there is a danger of death on both sides
 to kya peedit kisaanon ke halaat or yuddh main fanse masuumon ke halaat main koi fark he? After watching and reading the story, i called my partner again, asked if we were showing anything exaggeratedly
 mere saathi tejas ne kaha, nahin ghar ke saare bartan khaali hai
 The conditions of hungry children were not seen even from them
 kuch madad karke hi aage bade hai
 We also planned some help together
 lekin man main sawaal uthte rahe ki ek ghar main to ham pahunch gaye, lekin baaki kaa kya? sirf ek ghar kii bhukh mitaa kar kya hoga, jab puraa ilaaka hi chapet main he
 This story continued to bother throughout the day
 shaam hote meraa ye vichaar pakkaa ho gaya ki maharashtra main kisaanon kaa katl bade soche samajhe tareeke se hua he
 
 
 And happening
 sarkaron ko to pehle se maaloom he ki marathavada kaise banjar ilaake kii shakl le rahaa he
 Last year, when Indian Science Congress took place, we also reached to participate
 mausam vigyaniyon se hamane poocha tha ki kya marathavada or vidarbha kii pyaas bujh paaegi
 Then the scientists said that this is not possible
 ek kism ke chaaya kshetra or badalte mausam kii maar ye ilaaka jhel rahaa he
 Then we asked the question, do governments know all this? Then it came to know that the rulers have known for a long time what is going to happen in Marathwada? So the question arises that when the rulers know that there will be a drought, then why has no step taken in the last 20 years? The leader does not want to answer
 lekin sach yahi he ki maharashtra ke netaaon ne aisa hone diya he
 Thoughtfully farmers have been killed now there is no doubt about it
 20 saal main jitani bhi sinchai kii yojanaayen bani unamem se zyaadaatar pashchim maharashtra kii ore mode di gayi
 The remaining schemes that Vidarbha and Marathwada got were so corrupted that the canals and dams kept on paper only deteriorating
 pichley ek dashak main jin netaaon ne sinchai vibhaag sambhala wo pashchim maharashtra ke hi the
 He made all the plans for water sharing for his area first
 tippaniyan People from some of the most backward areas of Marathwada migrate during their power days and work as laborers
 ye mazdoor pashchim maharashtra main khapaae jate hai
 Is there any doubt as to why the big leaders of one area of maharashtra want to keep the people of other areas poor? Is unbalanced development not being intentional? marathavada main har maheene 69 kisaan khudakushi kar rahe hai
 
 
 And all this is happening because the state has created a kind of chaos by making unbalanced development
 jahaan mausam kii meharbaani par fasal nirbhar ho, netaaon ke rahamokaram par sinchai kaa pani or baaki kaa vikaas chand logon ke haath main ho, kya aam kisaan bebas or laachaar mahasoos nahin karata? kya yahi laachaari use zehar pine ke liye majboor nahin karti? kya aise hi halaat un logon ke nahin hai jo maut se bachane ke liye syria se bhaagate hai, jaanate hai ki donon taraf maut kaa khatra he
 So is there a difference between the situation of the suffering peasants and the situation of the innocent trapped in the war? din bhar ye kahani pareshaan karti rahi
 By the evening, i was convinced that the killing of farmers in Maharashtra was done in a thoughtful way

 Where the crop is dependent on the kindness of the weather, irrigation water and the rest of the development is in the hands of the leaders, does not the common farmer feel helpless and helpless? Does not this helplessness make him to drink poison? Is not the situation similar to those who flee Syria to avoid death, knowing that there is a danger of death on both sides
 to kya peedit kisaanon ke halaat or yuddh main fanse masuumon ke halaat main koi fark he? Last year, when Indian Science Congress took place, we also reached to participate
 mausam vigyaniyon se hamane poocha tha ki kya marathavada or vidarbha kii pyaas bujh paaegi
 Then the scientists said that this is not possible
 ek kism ke chaaya kshetra or badalte mausam kii maar ye ilaaka jhel rahaa he
 Then we asked the question, do governments know all this? Then it came to know that the rulers have known for a long time what is going to happen in Marathwada? So the question arises that when the rulers know that there will be a drought, then why has no step taken in the last 20 years? The leader does not want to answer
 lekin sach yahi he ki maharashtra ke netaaon ne aisa hone diya he
 Thoughtfully farmers have been killed now there is no doubt about it

 Is there any doubt as to why the big leaders of one area of maharashtra want to keep the people of other areas poor? Is unbalanced development not being intentional? marathavada main har maheene 69 kisaan khudakushi kar rahe hai
 
 
 And all this is happening because the state has created a kind of chaos by making unbalanced development
 jahaan mausam kii meharbaani par fasal nirbhar ho, netaaon ke rahamokaram par sinchai kaa pani or baaki kaa vikaas chand logon ke haath main ho, kya aam kisaan bebas or laachaar mahasoos nahin karata? kya yahi laachaari use zehar pine ke liye majboor nahin karti? kya aise hi halaat un logon ke nahin hai jo maut se bachane ke liye syria se bhaagate hai, jaanate hai ki donon taraf maut kaa khatra he
 So is there a difference between the situation of the suffering peasants and the situation of the innocent trapped in the war? 20 saal main jitani bhi sinchai kii yojanaayen bani unamem se zyaadaatar pashchim maharashtra kii ore mode di gayi

 So is there a difference between the situation of the suffering peasants and the situation of the innocent trapped in the war? marathavada ke kuch ati pichde ilaakon ke log apni bebasii ke dinon main palaayan karte hai or mazaduri karte hai
 These workers are consumed in Western Maharashtra

 isliye unhone ek plan banaaya
 The couple got around 1 from four insurance companies in November 2014 with the help of fake documents
 19 karod rupee kaabimakarwa diya, jisamen bahan maadhuri ko nomini banaaya gaya tha
 The couple involved three people in this conspiracy to carry out the incident

 In view of the financial loss to both these players, the league will also compensate some amount as compensation
 jwaala ko 19 hajaar america dollar milenge, jabaki ashvini ko 25 hajaar
 This happened due to the absence of a doubles match, which explains that this happened to Jwala and Ashwini due to lack of format of doubles match in the league
 sanchaalkon ne bataaya ki jab lig kaa shuruaati praaroop bana to usamen dubles match rakhe gaye the
 Due to the same, both these players were contracted
 magar phir lig ko dubles ke kaabil or charchit chehre nahin mili
 In such a situation, this event was dropped
 iske badale purushon ke singles match main ijapha kar diya gaya
 On Sunday, when the league's operators noticed that no franchise was showing interest in these two players, the auction was deferred until the next day
 baikaroom management ke baad somvaar ko khuli nilaamee shuru hui to gavarning council ne elaan kiya ki donon khilaadiyon kaa base prise gata diya gaya he
 The base prize of both the players was reduced from 50 thousand US Dollars to exactly half that is 25 thousand US Dollars
 in khilaadiyon ko is kadam se hone vaale nuksaan kii bharpai kaa bharosa diya gaya
 Slap has been slapped on our mouth: Ashwini While talking to a newspaper, Ashwini said that it is like a slap on our mouth
 unhone kaha ki ‚Äòmere saath dhokhaa kiya gaya he
 We were told that we are six icon players
 ham puure desh main is lig kaa iken player kii tarah pramotion kar rahe the
 Then suddenly all these changes were made and there was no need to even tell us
 ‚Äôham paison ke laalach ke liye isamen nahin aae theah jwalaudhar jwaala gutta boleen ki ham lig main paison ke laalach main nahin aae hai
 He said that 'we just wanted that the way other icon players are being respected, the same thing should be done to us
 magar aisa nahin hua
 This is a big shock for us
 sach kahuun to samaj hi nahin aa rahaa ki kya kahuun is puure masale par
 This is quite embarrassing
 maine kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki ek prafational lig main aisa bhi ho saktaa he
 Both these players were also angry that the organizers did not tell them anything even after the auction round was over
 kisi ne kharida hi nahin to ham kya karenudhar is puure masale par safai dete hue lig ke aayojakon main se ek ashish chaddha ne kaha ki sabhi iken players ke liye band nilaamee hui thi
 This process went on till late at night
 koi bhi frenchiji jwaala or aswani ko tay kiye prise par kharidne ke liye taiyaar nahin thi
 In such a situation, all the franchises and the governing council of the league decided that the base price be reduced to open auction
 lekin in khilaadiyon ne contract sin kiya he or hamen unke hiton kii raksha kerani thi
 It was therefore decided that the league would compensate for the auction of lesser amount than was fixed
 niti ayog kii sanchaalan parishad main hissaa le rahe bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne kendra pryojit yojanaon, aapadaa anugrah anudaan evam kisaan sammaan nidhi yojana ke kriyanvayan ke sambandh main mahatvapurn suzav die
 At the same time, Nitish Kumar once again reiterated his demand for special status to Bihar
 vishesh rajya ke darj kii maang ek baar phir rakhte hue nitish kumaar ne kaha, 'rajya sarkaar pichley kai varshon se 10 pratishat se adhik aarthik vikaas dar hasil karne main safal rahi he, jo rashtriya vikaas dar se adhik he
 Despite this, the per capita income of the state is much lower than other developed states and national average
 is rajya ko desh ke anya viksit rajyon tathaa rashtriya ausat ko praapt karne ke liye rajya sarkaar dwaara lambey samay se bihar ke liye vishesh rajya ke darje kii maang centre sarkaar se kii jaati rahi he
 In this context, i would like to draw attention to the recommendations of the Raghuram Rajan Committee set up by the Central Government, which presented the Composite Development Index for the states according to which the 10 most backward states of the country were identified, including Bihar
 
 is samiti kii anushanshaon main yah bhi ullekh kiya gaya tha ki sarvaadhik pichde rajyon main vikaas kii gati badhaane ke liye centre sarkaar anya rup main kendriya sahaayta uplabdh kara sakati he
 'apartments, malls and industry businesses do not lead to growth: Nitish Kumar Nitish Kumar said,' If the data related to the differences in the level of inter-regional and inter-state development is reviewed, it will be found that many states are different parameters of development like copy
 Individuals are well below the national average on the indicators of income, education, health, energy, institutional finance and human development
 udaaran ke taur par bihar kii prati vyakti aay 2017-18 main 28485 rupee thi jo ki bharat kii aus prativyakti aay 86668 rupee kaa maatr 32

 rajya main varsh 2005 main prati vyakti bijli kii khapat maatr 76 unit thi jo 2017-18 main bad kar 280 unit ho gayi, jabaki rashtriya ausat 1149 unit tha
 'special state status to Bihar is out of our agenda: 15th Finance Commission Chairman NK Singh Behar's Chief Minister said,' Similarly, if we look at the indices of human development, we will find that despite rapid progress we still have a long Distance has to be covered
 varsh 2005 main rajya main matra mrityu dar (prati lakh jansankhya par) 312 tha jo 2016 main ghatakar 165 ho gaya he jabaki rashtriya ausat 130 he
 The infant mortality rate (61 per 1000 population) was 61 in the year 2005, which has come down to 38 in 2016 but we are still behind the national average of 34
 ise atirikt rajya kaa jansankhya ghanatv 1106 vyakti prativarg kilometre he jabaki iskaa rashtriya ausat 382 he
 It is clear from these figures that although Bihar has done copy in most of the area in recent years, it is still far behind the national average in the indicators of development
 'bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja dilaane kii maang par tejasvi kaa tanj, PM nahin is jagah sampark karen 'nitish chachaa'nitish ne kaha, 'tarksangat aarthik ranneeti vahi hogi jo aise nivesh or hastantaran paddati ko protsaahit kare jisase pichde rajyon ko ek nirdhaarit samay seemaa main vikaas ke rashtriya ausat tak pahunchane main madad mili
 The demand for our special state status is based on this
 hamane lagaataar centre sarkaar se bihar ko vishesh rajya kaa darja die jane kii maang kii he
 With the grant of special state status to Bihar, on one hand there will be an increase in the share of centrally sponsored schemes, which will give the state the opportunity to use its resources in other development and welfare schemes, on the other hand, in the GST in line with the special state status
 Private investment will be encouraged by anticipated replenishment, industries will be established, employment will not be Opportunities will arise and help improve people's living standards
 '
 
 
 Due to this, Bihar cannot be given a special state status
 Apart from this, Nitish Kumar said that in the changing global, economic, social and technological environment, there is a need for inclusive thinking and vision for the development of the country
 raashtrapati bhawan main yojit baithak ko sambodhit karte hue mukhyamantri ne bihar se sambandhit mahatvapurn muddon ko baithak main rakhaa evam aashaa vyakt kii ki vikaas kii ranneeti banaate samay sabhi muddon evam sujhaavon par samyak vichaar kiya jayega
 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar gave important suggestions regarding the implementation of centrally sponsored schemes, disaster grace grant and Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana
 mukhyamantri ne pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi yojana ke tahat gaiyr raiyat (bataaidaar evam jotedaaron) kisaanon ko bhi shaamil karne kaa suzav diya
 He said that Bihar is a disaster-prone state
 yahaan baadh evam sukhaad jaisi aapadaaon se badi sankhya main log prabhavit hote hai
 He requested that the state should get the amount as per requirement like before 2015, eliminating the 25 percent cap of the State Disaster Response Fund to provide ex-gratia grant
 nitish kumaar ne kaha ki centre sarkaar centre dwaara pryojit yojanaon ko band kar praathamikta vaali yojanaon kaa kriyanvayan central sector skim ke tahat karaane kaa praavdhaan kiya janaa chahie
 State priority schemes should be implemented by the state governments from their own resources under the state scheme

 Meanwhile, Advani tried to clarify several times, but each time Sonia shook her head in disagreement and the Congress members stood in their places demanding to completely withdraw Advani's remarks
 sonia ke kade tevar dekh shinde or sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal ne bhi adwani se apni tippanee waapas lene ko kaha

 There is hardly any reader in Hindi, Urdu who has not heard the name of Munshi Premchand
 vah katha samraat, upanyaas samraat yon hi nahin kahe jate
 The picture he drew of Indian society, village and his era is unmatched
 munshi premchand kaa asli naam dhanpat raay tha
 He was born on 31 July 1880 in Lamhi village near Benares
 us jamaane main unke pita ko bees rupye tankhwaah milti thi
 It is said that when Dhanpat Rai was seven years old, his mother died
 jab ve pandraa saal ke hue, tab unki shaadi kar di gai or solah saal ke hone par unke pita kaa bhi dehant ho gaya
 As people say - boys have this age to play and eat, but Premchand had to worry about maintaining the house since then
 jab vah nawein darje main padhate the, tab unki gruhasthi main do sautele bhai, sauteli maan or khud unki patni shaamil ho chuki thim
 After completing his schooling, he went through a variety of struggles and did his BA in 1919 with English, Persian and history; But long before that, he started writing the story in Urdu from 1901
 urdu main vah nawab raay naam se likhaa karte the
 Soze Vatan, his first compilation of Urdu stories written in 1910, was published
 is sankalan ke british sarkaar dwaara jabt kar liye jane par unhone nawab raay chhodkar premchand naam se likhnaa shuru kiya
 'premchand' - This lovely name was given to him by Dayanarayan Nigam, an Urdu writer and editor
 jaalianwala baag hatyakand or asahyog andolan ke chhidane par premchand ne apni bees saal kii naukari par laat maar di
 At the beginning of the disobedience movement of 1930, he also started publishing 'hans'
 premchand ko katha-samraat banane main jahaan unki saikadon kahaniyon kaa yogadan he, vahiin godaan, sevasadan, premashram, gaban, rangabhumi, nirmala jaise upanyaas unhen hindi sahitya main hameshaa amar banaae rakhenge
 Shivkumar Mishra has written about compiling the complete stories of Premchand, when Premchand came on the stage of the story, he was familiar with his narrative tradition of India, he was well aware of the stories and aficionados of Urdu and arabic-persian
 pashchim ke katha-lekhakon ko bhi unhone padhaa tha
 Despite this, his compositions came to be in conformity with his own vision of expression, rather than being molded into a certain form of story-writing, that the story should be transparent, abstract and able to convey its sensory objectives well to the reader
 Ho
 premchand kii kahaniyon ke rachana-shilp kii buniyadi visheshta yah he ki vah kahin se bhi, kisi bhi kone se, ayasajnya nahin he
 Very simple and simple
 yah sahajata or saadhaaranta hi uski sabase badi visheshta he
 Premchand has given more importance to situations and contexts rather than events in the composition of his stories
 unki kahaniyaan isi naate ghatana-pradhan kahaniyaan nahin hai or na hi ghatana-pradhan kahaniyon kii tarah ve pathakon main kautuhal yaa jigyaasa vritti upjaati hai
 The reader of Premchand's stories, rather than the curiosity of 'what will happen next', becomes interested in the development of Premchand, emerging from the midst of the depicted situations and contexts
 premchand apane pathak ko apni samvednaa ke vrutt main is tarah le lete hai ki vah unki buni hui sthitiyon or unke rache charitron ke saath-saath aage badhata jaataa he
 He becomes a storyteller's companion
 premchand kii kahaniyon ke rachana-shilp ko baariki se dekhen to spasht hoga ki premchand ek rachanaakaar ke rup main kahani main anaavashyak dakhal nahin dete
 They highlight their sensory purpose through the situations and themes woven into the story, and as these situations and themes relate not to their imagination but to the reality of life and the truth of life, the reader's heart-mind Credibility gets marked by you
 aaj munshi premchand kii jayanti par ham lok bharti dwaara prakashit 'premchand kii sampurna kahaniyaan' se unki kaaljayi kahani thakur kaa kuan sahitya ajtak ke pathakon ke liye prastut kar rahe
 Story: Thakur's well- Premchandjokhu put lotus in his mouth and there was a strong smell in the water
 gangi se bolaa- yah kaisaa pani he? maare baas ke piya nahin jaataa
 The throat is being drained and you feed them rotten water
 gangi pratidin shaam ko pani bhar liya karti thi
 The well was far away; It was difficult to visit again and again
 kal vah pani laayi, to usamen bu bilkul na thi; aaj pani main badboo kisi? lotaa naak se lagaaya, to sachmuch badboo thi
 Surely some animal may have fallen into the well and died, but from where will the other water come in? Who will allow Thakur to climb the well
 dur se log daant bataayenge
 Sahu's well is at that end of the village; But who will allow water to fill there too? The fourth well is not in the village
 jokhu kai din se biimaar he
 For some time, he stopped silent while thirsty, and then he said - now he is no longer thirsty
 laa, thodaa pani naak band karke pi lun
 Gangee did not give water
 kharaab pani pine se beemaari bad jaaygi- itnaa jaanati thi; parantu yah na jaanati thi ki pani ko ubaal dene se uski kharabi jaati rahati he
 Bid how will you drink this water? Don't know which animal is dead
 kuen se main doosraa pani laaye detii hoon
 Jokhu looked at him with surprise - where will he bring the other water from? ‚Äùthakur and Sahu have two wells
 kya ek lotaa pani na bharne denge?‚Äô‚Äòhaath-paanv tudwa aayegi or kuch na hoga
 Sit quietly
 brahm-devtaa aashirwad denge, thakur lathi maarenge, saahuji ek ke paanch lenge
 Who understands the pain of the poor! Even if we die, no one comes to look at the Duar, it is a great thing to shoulder it
 aise log kuen se pani bharne denge?‚Äôin shabdon main kaduva satya tha
 What would Gangi answer? But he did not give the stinky water to drink
 raat ke nau baje the
 The exhausted laborers had fallen asleep, ten-five befikre were deposited at Thakur's door
 maidani bahaduree kaa to ab na jamaana rahaa he, na mauka
 There was talk regarding legal bravery; How cleverly Thakur bribed the Thanedar in a special case and went out cleanly
 kitni aklamandi se ek marke ke mukaddame kii nakal le aaye
 Nazir and Mohtamim, everyone used to say, cannot be copied
 koi pachaas maangata; koi sau
 Here he blabbed money
 kaam karne kaa dhang chahie
 At this time Gangi came to fetch water from the well
 kuppi kii dhundli roshni kuen par aa rahi thi
 Gangi started waiting for the opportunity sitting in the guise of the world
 is kuen kaa pani sara gaanv peetaa he
 No holds barred for anyone; Only these unlucky ones cannot fill it
 
 The rebellious heart of Gangi started hurting at the customary restrictions and compulsions - why are we low and why are these people high? Because these people put a snake in the neck? How many are there here, one by one sorted? Do this theft, do this fraud, do it in false cases
 abhi is thakur ne to us din bechaare gadriye kii ek bhed chura lee thi or baad main markar kha gaya
 Twelve months of gambling take place in the house of this Panditji
 yahi saahuji to ghi main tel milakar bechate hai
 They get the work done, the grandmother dies while giving her strength
 kis baat main hai hamase unche
 Yes, higher than us
 ham gali-gali chillaate nahin ki ham unche hai, ham unche hai! kabhi gaanv main aa jaati hoon, to rasabhari aankhon se dekhne lagate hai
 As the snake starts rolling on everyone's chest, but pride is that we are tall
 kuen par kisi ke aane kii aahat hui
 Gangi's chest began to flutter
 kahin dekh le, to gajab ho jaay
 Not even a single leg should be put down
 usne gadaa or rassi uthaa lee or jhukkar chalati hui ek vriksh ke andhere saaye main ja khadi hui
 When do these people feel pity on someone
 bechaare mahangu ko itnaa maaraa ki maheenon lahu thukta rahaa
 Because he had not given up! These people become tall on it
 kuen par do striyaan pani bharne aayi thim
 Things were happening in them
 ‚Äòkhaanaa khaane chale or hukum hua ki taaja pani bhar lao
 There is no money for the pitcher
 ‚Äô‚Äòham logon ko aaraam se baithe dekhakar jaise maradon ko jalan hoti he
 "yes, it was not so that the Kalasia would be picked up and filled
" bas, hukum chalaa diya ki taaja pani lao, jaise ham laundiyaan hi to hai
 "if you don't have a laundia, what else are you?" Can't get bread and clothes? You take away ten to five rupees
 or laundia kisi hoti he
 "don't be ashamed, sister!" He has a longing to rest for a snatch
 itnaa kaam kisi duusare ke ghar kar detii, to isse kahin aaraam se rahati
 Above all he acknowledges the favor
 yahan kaam karte-karte mar jaao; par kisi kaa munh hi nahin sidhaa hota
 'when both of them went full of water, Gangi came out from the shade of the tree and came to the world of the well
 beficre chale gayi the
 Thakur was also going to sleep in the courtyard after closing the door
 gangi ne kshanik sukh kii saans lee
 Somehow the ground was cleared
 amrit chura laane ke liye jo rajkumaar kisi jamaane main gaya tha, vah bhi shaayad itani saavdhaanee ke saath or samaj-boojhkar na gaya hoga
 Gangi buried her feet in the well of the world
 vijay kaa aisa anubhav use pehle kabhi na hua tha
 He molded the noose of rope into the pot
 daayen-baayen chaukanni drushti se dekha, jaise koi sipaahi raat ko shatru ke kile main suraakh kar rahaa ho
 If she is caught at this time, then there is no hope of forgiveness or concession for her
 ant main devataaon ko yaad karke usne kalejaa majboot kiya or gadaa kuen main daal diya
 The pitcher dived into the water, very slow
 jaraa bhi aawaaj na hui
 Gangi killed two or four hands quickly
 gadaa kuen se munh tak aa pahunchaa
 Even a big wrestler could not pull it so fast
 gangi jhuki ki ghade ko pakadakar jagat par rakhe, ki ekaek thakur sahab kaa darwaja khul gaya
 The lion's face is not going to be any more terrible than this
 gangi ke haath se rassi chhot gayi
 The pitcher with the rope fell into the water and for a few moments the sound of light was heard in the water
 thakur, ‚Äòkoun he, koun he?‚Äô pukaarte hue kuen kii taraf aa rahe the or gangi jagat se kudakar bhaagi ja rahi thighar pahunchakar dekha ki jokhu lotaa munh se lagaaye vahi mailaa-ganda pani pi rahaa he

 Sangeeta Bijlani later married cricketer and now MP Azharuddin

 i think man, its relation is going so well, then i should not do any problem or cause anything because of me
 ise log aise kehete hai ki dekho, salmaan gilti feel kar rahaa he
 Steals the sight
 to thik he yaar
 Not married to Sangeeta, but is a close friend, Wahsalman Khan said, referring to his many previous relationships, now he wants to live beyond the burden of expectations and future stress
 shaadi ke masale par 47 saal ke is superstar ne kaha ki haa, ye mumkin he ki aage aisa ho
 Nothing at the moment
 vah bole, ‚Äòpehle kai baar maamla behad kareeb aakar ruk gaya
 Wedding cards were also printed with Sangeeta Bijlani
 magar ye ek samajhadaar faisla tha
 Sangeeta still comes home and is our family friend
 ‚Äôab tak kunvaara hum main, khud ko bivi ke liye bachaakar rakhaa haderlafrends se jude ek sawaal par salmaan mazaakia andaaj main bole ki nahin, ve sab sirf meri dost thim
 Salman said that this was my dialogue, which was later adopted by many stars
 unhone kaha ki main ab tak virgin (kunvaara) hum or maine khud ko apni bivi ke liye bachaakar rakhaa he
