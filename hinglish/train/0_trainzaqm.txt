 BJP MLA Bhushan Bhatt of Jamalpur Khadia area of ahmedabad is distributing saffron colored cans of garbage in his area nowadays
 aam taur par yah dibbe nile yaa hare rang ke hote hai
 Bhushan Bhatt says that they are doing everything for cleanliness
 unhen bhagava rang zyada aakarshak lagata he
 They say that people see your work and i think saffron color is good for the eyes
 tippaniyan Bhatt has so far distributed 1000 dustbins from his MLA fund by spending Rs 3 lakh
 ve kah rahe hai ki yah sirf swatchta mishan ke liye ho rahaa he
 But the opposition Congress considers it politically motivated, because it is the election year
 congress kaa aarope he ki yah puri tarah sansthaanon ke bhagavakaran ke agenda ke tahat ho rahaa he
 Painting the garbage cans in saffron color is showing the petty mentality of the BJP
 bhaajapa 1975 se is seat se chunaav jitati rahi he
 This seat has been formed from Jamalpur Khadia, combining the earlier two assembly seats Khadia and Jamalpur
 khadia hameshaa se bhaajapa kaa or jamalpur hameshaa se congress kaa garh rahaa he
 There are a large number of minority community voters in this area
 log kah rahe hai ki agar agenda sirf safai he to thik he, lekin logon ko khulkar virodh karnaa mushkil lag rahaa he
 Before the last Lok Sabha elections, bus stops were painted in saffron color, then there was a growing controversy with children coloring in school kits and now dustbins
 bhatta ne apane vidhayak fund se teen lakh rupee kharch karke ab tak 1000 dustbin baante hai
 They are saying that this is happening only for the cleanliness mission
 lekin virdohi paksh congress ise raajnneeti se prerit maanata he, kyonki yah chunavi saal he
 The Congress alleges that this is being done entirely under the agenda of saffronisation of institutions
 kachare ke dibbon ko bhi bhagava rang main rangana bhaajapa kii ochhi maansikta dikhaa rahaa he
 BJP has been winning elections from this seat since 1975
 yah seat jamalpur khadia pehle kii do vidhansabha siten khadia or jamalpur ko milakar banaai gai he
 Khadia has always been the stronghold of the BJP and Jamalpur has always been the Congress stronghold
 is ilaake main badi sankhya main laghumati samudaay ke voter hai
 People are saying that if the agenda is just clean then fine, but people are finding it difficult to protest openly
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bas stop bhagava rang main range gaye the, phir bacchon ko skool kits or ab dustbin bhi bhagava rang main rangane se vivaad bad rahaa he

 a post shared by Nora Fatehi (@norafatehi) on Oct 14, 2018 at 8:08am PDT In a country like India where 'gender' has entered into everyday life like water in milk
 lakh koshish kar lo alag hi nahin hota
 It is not that the outlook has not changed at all
 par saalon saal kii is dharna ko tuutane main vakt to lagata he naa! gorakhpur kii kirti or uske bhai krish, us vakt unke mohalle or jaan pahchaan waalon ke liye ajooba ban gaye jab kirti ne 'ladi bounsar' banane or krish ne ‘shef’ banane kii ichha jataai
 Think how hot this news of a city like Gorakhpur must have become when a girl talks of fighting and a boy is cooking
 logon ne sharma ji kii khub khilli udayi, taane maare or poochne lage bhai sharma ji dekh lo kahin aapke betaa-beti main 'gender' kaa locha to nahin
 That means son-daughter and not daughter-son! Sharmine (sharma ji's wife) has a bad condition
 kehane lageen, vaise bhi in 'satarangi' logon ne to hawa hi kharaab kar di he desh kii
 Is this really happening somewhere? If you bite Sharma, there is no blood
 kirti ne maa-baap kii is uljhan ko khatm karne ke liye ek trick khoji
 Sharma ji was not a less educated person
 ve uniwarsity main psychology ke prefesar or maa junior secondry main ganit kii adhyapika
 Kirti said, mother, could you teach Hindi or English or even psychology? The mother responded quickly, otherwise i was very fast in mathematics since childhood
 par ganit kaa gender to purush kaa hota he naa! matlab yahi to mana jaataa he naa ki ganit ladakon ko zyada samaj aati he
 Mother said quickly, yes there was custom in my family
 ladkiyaan art padhein or agar kisi ladki ne science padhane ke liye kaha to phir biology padhe, ganit padhane vaali to main pahil ladki thi
 Sharmine m
 es
 c did mathematics
 or ladke to chaahakar bhi ganit nahin chhod sakate the
 Then Kirti said to her father, does father even read 'psychology'? aap ganit ke professor hote to kitna acha hota
 Our friends say that the gender of psychology is that of a woman! The father did not answer, but he understood that Kirti was asking this question to get him confused
 khayr, yah to acha tha ki kirti ke ghar main hi dharanaon ko todane vaale udhaaharan maujuud the
 But if it were not so? However, there is a plethora of research and researches that crush this typological notion
 2018 main hachinson, liance or ansaari ne pehali kaksha se lekar chhathvin kaksha tak ke chaatro kii vishyon ke anusaar ruchi or kshamta jaanakar nishkarsh nikaala kii vishay or gender kaa bahut kam sambandh hota he
 But as the subject grows older, the relation of gender becomes deeper
 myne? bachche jaise-jaise bade hote hai ve apni ruchi se zyada saamaajik soch ke anusaar har cheez chunanaa shuru karte hai
 Clothes, subjects of study, career etc
, etc
 
 
 2014 main helparn naam ke ek shodhakarta ne is par anusandhan kiya
 Well, as children grow up, they start reinforcing the streams of gender
 to unhone paaya maa-baap ke bachche zyada kareeb hote hai
 Parental acceptance means the most to them
 maa-baap apane bacchon se vahi maang karte hai jo samaaj kii dharanaon ke khaanche main bilkul feet baithe
 And the children go on being imprisoned by the chains of gender in the fit of this groove
 kuch bachche to ise todakar aage bad jate hai par zyaadaatar in gender kii dharanaon main kaid rahete hai
 American writer Judy Butler has done a lot of work on Gender
 judi kahati hai, ‘‘gender koi tathy nahin he balki kai tarah ke vyavhaar gender kaa idia banaate hai or phir yahi dharanaen khaanche banaati hai jinamein ham insaanon ko bharna shuru kar dete hai
 Judy Butler's 'gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity' and another famous psychologist and writer working on gender and the British philosopher Cordolia Fine's 'testosterone Rex: Unmaking the Myth of Gendered' The book 'testosterone Rex' exposes many such eye-opening facts
 un dharanaon ko todatii hai jo yah kahati hai, kshamtaaon ke bhi gender hote hai
 *** kai aise maukey aate hai jab auraton ko lagata he ki agar wo mahila na hokar purush hotin to zyada acha hota
 Women have to go through many such things and situations that men never even face
 kai baar aisi sthiti ban jaati he ki mahilaayein chaahakar bhi apni samasya yaa takalif dusron ko nahin bataa paatin or unhen akele hi sabakuch sahanaa padataa he
 Although there are some men who understand women and their problems to a great extent, but there is no less number of men who are completely ignorant of all these things
 ye kuch aisi hi baaten or samasyaayein hajinase ek ladki ko guzarana padataa he
 1
 periods kii takalifmahilaon ko har maheene is takalif se guzarana padataa he
 Along with tolerating the pain and irritability of periods, they also fear that the clothes will not get stained
 bag main sanetary napkin ko chhipaakar rakhanaor aise main agar koi purush galati se bhi bag khol le to sthiti behad asahaj ho jaati he
 Boys never understand this problem of girls
 2
 Breast feed is the most beautiful feeling in the world for any woman to be a mother, but handling a child is quite a challenge
 kai baar aisa hota he kibache ko saarvajanik sthaan par bhukh lag jaati he or maa ko use breast feed karana padataa he
 Such a situation also makes women somewhat uncomfortable, but rarely do men realize this problem of women
 3
 There are many women who find it uncomfortable to wear traditional clothes and on the contrary there are many who have trouble wearing western dress
 par kai baar aise maukey aate hai jab unhen dusron kii khushi ke liye unke anusaar kapade pahanane padate he
 4
 ghar or offis ko ekasaath sanbhalanaghar or offis ko ekasaath sanbhaalanaa kisi ke liye bhi aasaan nahin he
 But most women have to handle all this alone
 unhen bacchon ke homework se lekar apane offis project sabhi ko sambhalanaa padataa he
 This is a very difficult task that only men realize
 5
 Time for oneself a person needs some time for himself
 par ghar or offis kii jimmedaariyon ko nibhaate-nibhaate ek aurat ke paas itnaa vakt hi nahin bachataa he ki wo apane liye bhi kuch soch sake
 Sometimes this condition causes stress, which causes irritability
 mahilaon kii is samasya ko kam hi purush samajhate hai

 ) bathinda main dhan kii paraali jalaakar sarkaar ke khilaaf pradarshnapunjab sarkaar, NGT or punjab haryana hoicourt ke nishane parbadhate pradooshanko dekhte hue punjab kisaanon par dabaav he ki ve kheton main paraali na jalaaen
 In such a situation, the farmers of Punjab are angry that the state government is neither helping them to deal with the problem of stubble, nor is giving any compensation, while the National Green Tribunal (NGT) also directed for it Have given
 bhartiya kisaan union ke sangrur jile ke adhyaksh manjit singh kaa kahana he, 'rajya sarkaar hamen 200 rupee prati quintal kii sahaayta pradaan karne main vifal rahi he
 Now we have asked farmers to burn paddy straw without hesitation
 jab tak sarkaar hamen muaavja nahin detii tab tak ham dhan kii paraali ko jalaakar nasht karnaa jari rakhenge
 Workers of the Bharatiya Kisan Union have also protested against the government by burning paddy Kiprali in Bathinda as the government has failed to give compensation to the farmers to stop burning stubble
 paraali nasht karne kii mashin main gad badiyanis masale ko lekar punjab sarkaar, neshnal green tribunel or punjab haryana hoicourt ke nishane par he
 Now the government is saying on one hand that we are providing machines to the farmers at a subsidy of 50 percent to destroy the straw in a scientific manner, but on the other hand it is asking the Central Government to give compensation of 100 rupees per quintal yield
 Has been haal hi main mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ne daawa kiya ki sarkaar ne pichley saal kisaanon ko 28000 aisi mashine muhaiyaa karai hai
 Are these machines suited to dispose of the straw? Or did the farmers who used these machines to get rid of the straw, get rid of burning the straw? In order to get answers to these questions, in many parts of Punjab, he tried to know the reality by talking to the farmers
 punjab main bahusankhya main seemaant kisaanon kii he, isliye ve lakhon rupee kharch karke happy seader or rotaweater jaisi mashine nahin kharid sakate, jinke daam do lakh se lekar 16 lakh tak hai
 Secondly, a tractor of at least 50 horsepower is also required to run these heavy machines
 punjab ke kisaanon main aam taur par 20 harsapower tak kaa tractor istemaal hota he
 Machines expensive for farmers: Farmers said that last year used stubble blasting machines
 zyaadaatar kisaanon kaa kahana he ki keval bade kisaan hi in mashiinon kaa kharch uthaa sakate hai
 Others, who have used it, are not in favor of its further use for several reasons
 kisaanon kaa kahana he ki jabase sarkaar ne is mashin par 50 pratishat sabsidi kii gho shanaa kii he, nirmaataaon ne iskaa daam doguna kar diya he
 Jaswinder Singh, a farmer from Bathinda, says the Happy Cedar machine did not completely destroy the paddy straw, which later led to termites and other insects in the field
 duusare, dhan kii paraali khet main maujuud rahane par, agar usamen gehun bote hai to beej thik se ugte nahin, kyonki paraali unako mitti ke sampark se roak detii he
 The only way to destroy it is to burn it
 "jasvindar kaa suzav he ki rajya sarkaar ko kheton se paraali nasht karne ke liye apni mashine rakhni chahie or unka istemaal karnaa chahie
 Another farmer from Bathinda, Gurmeet Singh, who used the Happy Cedar machine last year, said that the use of the machine resulted in the residue of paddy straw, which led to lower wheat yield There was a decline of 10 to 15 kg per hectare
 khet ko saaf karne main sakasham nahin mashinenek or kisaan ikbaal singh ne rotaweater kaa istemaal kiya tha or unka kahana he ki ve is baar iskaa istemaal nahin karenge kyonki mashin main kami he, yah khet ko saaf karne main sakasham nahin he or isse gehun bone main dikkat aati he
 The farmers say that the state government lacked funds to give them compensation
 centre sarkaar kii ore se 100 rupee prati quintal kii sahaayta dene kaa rajya sarkaar kaa prastaav abhi bhi dhul phank rahaa he
 Anyway, growing paddy crop is not much beneficial for the farmers as its cost has almost doubled
 prati acre kam se kam 16000 kii laagat aati he or dhan kii keemat 1800 rupee prati quintal he
 Now, to clear the fields, farmers have to spend 2000 rupees more per acre, they do not think it appropriate
 bihar main kai ilaakon main monsoon kii barish ke saath bijli girane se 56 logon kii maut ho gai
 In the monsoon rains, the incidence of lightning falls is rare
 lekin bihar main kai jagahon par bijli girane kii ghatana ko vaigyanik monsoon kii tej shuruyaat or garam hawaaon ke bichmel-milaap se jodakar dekh rahe hai
 According to scientists, more than 50 deaths due to lightning in Bihar, there is an upheaval in Bihar at the height of three to four kilometers from the ground at this time
 monsoon kii hawaaen jaise hibihar main daakhilhuin inkaa takaraav aas-paas ke ilaake kii garam hawaaon se shuru ho gaya
 This triggered a strong rain in Bihar with lightning
 somvaar or mangalvaar ko bihar main hui joardaar barish or kadakati bijli se sabase zyada prabhavit hone vaali jagahon main patna, camoor, rohtas, chhapra, katihaar, aurangabad, madhepura or purniya hai
 The possibility of lightning collapsing due to the collision of air, due to the system in the Bay of Bengal, the moist winds are going up to a height of two to three kilometers, when these moist winds rise up, it becomes cloudy and it rains
 lekin is samay uttar bharat main teen kilometre kii oonchai ke upar pachua hawaaon kaa bhi jor he
 These westerly winds blowing up to a height of five kilometers are dry, ie the humidity is very low in them
 is vajah se nam hawaaon or sukhi hawaaon ke bich bihar ke upar takaraav hua or isse barish hui lekin is takaraav kii vajah se badalon main jabardast tareeke se hui
 The rub caused a strong lightning
 akashiya bijli se bachane ke upymausam vibhaag ke adishnal diarector general em mahapaatr ke mutabik badalon main gharshan kii vajah se bihar main kai jagahon par vajrapaat hua jisamen logon kii mautahui
 But light electricity can be avoided, the simplest way is that you do not go under the tree when the lightning strikes and if possible, stay in the house
 electronic upkarnon kaa istemaal band kar den
 According to the weather department, there is a possibility of thunderfall whenever it rains in North India and Northeast India during the monsoon
 lekin is baar kam samay main vajrapaat kii ghatnaayen kuch zyada hi dekhi gai hai
 It is said that it is not possible to make accurate estimates about thunderclap
 lekin ek baat to vaigyanik daawey ke saath kah sakate hai ki agar kharaab mausam main aapane akashiya bijli girte hue dekh rahe hai to bijli aap par nahin giregi, kyonki vajrapaat kii raftaar prakaash kii gati ke samatuly hoti he lihaaja aap apane upar bijli girte hue to kabhi bhi nahin dekh sakate hai
 The year was 2003
 atal bihari vaajapeyi desh ke pradhanmantri the
 She had a chaat party for women at her residence on Women's Day
 is party main sonia kaaphi asahaj mahasoos kar rahi thim, lekin vaajapeyi ne apni chir-parichit style main sonia ke saamne aisi peshkash kii ki unki sari asahajata dur ho gai
 Click here to pay homage to Atal Bihari Vajpayee On the afternoon of March 8, 2003, at the Prime Minister's residence 7 Race Course Road (RCR, now called Lok Kalyan Marg), women from all walks of life were gathered
 kai mahilaayein reshmi saadiyon or julari se saj-sanvar kar bhi ai thim
 But the two biggest attractions of this party were Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her close Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, sitting on a long cane couch in an isolated corner
 kone main baithe hone ke baavjood sabhi kii nazren in par hi thim
 With the body language of Sonia, it seemed as if the party wanted to settle down and go quickly
 ve thodi adheer or rakshaatmak dikh rahi thim
 Actually, Sonia Gandhi was a little hesitant
 saal 1999 mencongress ke passsankhya nahin thi, lekin vaajapeyi kii 13 maheene kii sarkaar gira di gai thi
 The BJP had accused Sonia Gandhi of imposing elections on the country
 is vajah se sonia sahaj nahin thim
 But for Vajpayee, this thing was old
 gahare band gale ke suut main fab rahe vaajapeyi sofe ke paas hi duusare kone main ek kursi par baithe hue the
 He was smiling and it seemed that he was in the mood to enjoy some of Sonia's discomfort
 aakhirkaar donon ke bich bani chuppi unhone hi todi
 He turned to his guests and said, "hey, bring some chaat for them, women love chaat
" 'aasapaas patrkaar bhi the
 After saying this, the then Prime Minister Vajpayee laughed out loud and even Sonia and Sheela could not live without smiling
 vaajapeyi yah jaanate the ki virodhiyon kaa dil kaise jeeta jaataa he
 About him former Finance Minister
 chidambaramane sahi hi kaha he, 'sach yah nahin he ki vaajapeyi ji ke bahut dost the, sach to yah he ki unka koi dushman nahin tha

 kahani: idgadarmadan ke puure tees rojon ke baad id ai he
 How beautiful, so pleasant morning
 vrikshon par kuch ajeeb hariyaali he, kheton main kuch ajeeb raunak he, aasmaan par kuch ajeeb laalimaa he
 Look at today's sun, how sweet, so cold, as if greeting the world on Eid
 gaanv main kitni halchal he
 Preparations are going on to go to Idgah
 kisi ke kurte main batan nahin he, pados ke ghar se sui-taagaa laane ko dauda ja rahaa he
 Somebody's shoes are hardened, they run to Teli's house to pour oil
 jaldi-jaldi belon ko sani-pani de den
 Returning from Idgah will be noon
 teen kos kaa paidal rasta, phir saikadon aadamiyon se milanaa,bhent karnaa
 Returning before noon is impossible
 ladke sabase zyada prasann hai
 Some have kept a fast, that too till noon, none of that, but the joy of going to Idgah is a part of their part
 roje bade-buudhon ke liye honge
 It is Eid for them
 roj id kaa naam ratate the
 Today she arrived
 ab jaldi padi he ki log idgah kyon nahin chalate
 What purpose do they have from family concerns
 sevaiyon ke liye doodh or shakkar ghar main he yaa nahin, inaki bhalaa se, ye to sevaiyaan khaayenge
 What should they know about why Badbahas are running to Chaudhary Kayamali's house! What is the news to them that if Chaudhary turns his eyes today, then all this Eid becomes Muharram
 unki apni jebon main to kuber kaa dhan bharaa hua he
 Repeatedly count your treasure out of pocket and keep it happy again
 mahmud ginata he, ek-do, das-baarah
 He has twelve paise
 mohsin ke paas ek, do, teen, aath, nau, pandrah paise hai
 In these countless money, you will bring countless things - toys, sweets, bugle, balls and what-what! And Hamid is most happy
 vah chaar-paanch saal kaa garib-surat, dublaa-patala ladkaa, jiskaa baap gat varsh haije kii bhent ho gaya or maan na jane kyon pili hoti-hoti ek din mar gai
 No one knows what the disease is
 kahati bhi to koun sunne vaala tha
 What used to pass on the heart, she endured in the heart and when not endured, she left the world
 ab hamid apni budhi daadi ameena kii god main sota he or utana hi prasann he
 His father has gone to earn Rs
 bahut-si theliyaan lekar aayenge
 Ammijan has gone to bring all the good things for him from Allahmiyan's house, so Hamid is happy
 aashaa to badi cheez he or phir bacchon kii aashaa! unki kalpana to rai kaa parvat bana leti hai
 Hamid has no shoes on his feet, an old-fashioned hat on the head, which has turned black, yet he is happy
 jab uske abbajaan theliyaan or ammijaan niamaten lekar aaengi to vah dil ke armaan nikaal legaa
 Then Mahmud, Mohsin, Noor and Sammi will see how much money they will withdraw
 abhaagini ameena apni kothri main baithi ro rahi he
 Today is Eid day and there is no grain in his house
 aaj aabid hota to kya isi tarah id aati or chali jaati? is andhkaar or niraashaa main vah dubi ja rahi he
 Who called this Nigodi Eid? He has nothing to do with this household, But Hamid! What does it mean for someone to die? There is light inside, hope outside
 vipatti apana sara dalbal lekar aae, hamid kii anand-bhari chitwan uskaa vidhwans kar degi
 Hamid goes inside and tells grandmother - Amma, don't you be afraid, i will go first
 bilkul na darana
 a fair was organized from the village
 or bacchon ke saath hamid bhi ja rahaa tha
 Occasionally all of them ran to get ahead
 phir kisi ped ke neeche khadey hokar saath waalon kaa intjaar karte
 Why are these people walking so slowly? Hamid's feet have been put on
 vah kabhi thak saktaa he? shahar kaa daaman aa gaya
 There are rich people gardens on both sides of the road
 pakki charadivari bani hui he
 Mangoes and leeches are planted in the trees
 kabhi-kabhi koi ladkaa kankad uthaakar aam par nishaanaa lagaataa he
 The gardener turns out to be abusive from the inside
 ladke vahaan se ek furlongs par hai
 Are laughing a lot
 mali ko kaise ullu banaaya he!ab basti ghani hone lagi thi
 Groups of Idgah goers started appearing
 ek se ek bhadkile vastra pahane hue, koi ikke-taange par savaar, koi motor par, sabhi itr main based, sabhi ke dilon main umang
 The small group of villagers, oblivious to their misfortune, were merry in satisfaction and patience
 bacchon ke liye nagar kii sabhi chizein anokhi thim
 Whatever you looked at, you would keep staring
 or peeche se baar-baar horn kii aawaaj hone par bhi na chetate
 Hamid survived by going under the motor
 sahasaa idgah najar aayaa
 There is cool shade of tamarind tree upstairs
 neeche pakkaa farsh he, jis par jajim bicha hua he or rojedaaron kii panktiyaan ek ke peeche ek na jane kahan tak chali gai hai, pakki jagat ke neeche tak, jahaan jajim bhi nahin he
 Newcomers come and stand in the back row
 aage jagah nahin hai
 Nobody sees money or position here
 islam kii nigaah main sab baraabar hai
 These villagers also did the waju and stood in the back row
 kitna sundar sanchaalan he, kitni sundar vyavastha! lakhon sir ek saath sijade main jhuk jate hai, phir sab-ke-sab ek saath khadey ho jate hai
 Bend together and kneel down together
 kai baar yahi kriya hoti he, jaise bijli kii lakhon battiyaan ek saath pradipt hon or ek saath bujh jaaen or yahi kram chalata rahe
 What a unique scene, whose collective actions, expansion and infinity filled the heart with reverence, pride and self-respect
 maanon bhraatrutiv kaa ek sutara in samast atmaaon ko ek ladi main piroe hue hai
 Namaz is over, people are embracing each other
 tab mithai or khilone kii dukaan par dhaava hota he
 The group of villagers is no less enthusiastic than the boys in this matter
 yah dekho, hindola he
 Go by paying a penny
 kabhi aasmaan par jate hue maaloom honge, kabhi jameen par girte hue
 There is a wheel, wooden elephants, horses, camels, hanging with sticks
 ek paisa dekar baith jaao or pachchis chakkaron kaa majaa lo
 Mahmud and Mohsin, Noor and Sammi sit on these horses and camels
 hamid dur khadaa he
 Just three paisa is all that he has
 apane kosh kaa ek tihaai, jaraa-sa chakkar khaane ke liye, vah nadeen de saktaa
 Sweets are followed by toys
 kisi ne revadiyaan lee hai, kisi ne gulab jamun, kisi ne sohan halava
 Having fun
 hamid birdari se pruthak he
 The unfortunate have three pennies
 kya nahin kuch lekar khaataa? lalachaai aankhon se sabaki or dekhtaa he
 After the sweets, some shops are made of iron, some gilt and some fake jewelry
 ladakon ke liye yahan koi aakarshan na tha
 They all move forward
 hamid lohe kii dukaan par ruk jaataa he
 Many tongs were kept
 use khyaal aayaa, daadi ke paas chimata nahin he
 When we remove the roti from the pan, the hand burns
 agar vah chimata le jaakar daadi ko de de, to vah kitni prasann hongi! phir unki ungliyaan kabhi na jalengi
 There will be a useful thing at home
 khilone se kya faaydaa
 Money is wasted in vain
 usne dukandaar se poocha, yah chimata kitne kaa he?dukandaar ne uski ore dekha or koi aadmi saath na dekhakar kaha, ‘yah tumhaare kaam kaa nahin he ji’‘bikaoo he ki nahin?’‘bikaoo kyon nahin he? or yahan kyon lad laae hai?’‘to bataate kyon nahin, kai paise kaa he?’‘chah paise lagenge?’hamid kaa dil baith gaya
 'please tell exactly
 ’‘thik-thaak paanch paise lagenge, lenaa ho lo, nahin to chalate bano’hamid ne kalejaa majboot karke kaha-teen paise loge?yah kahata hua vah aage bad gaya ki dukandaar kii ghudkiyaan na sune
 But the shopkeeper did not turn around
 bulaakar chimata de diya
 Hamid placed him on his shoulder like a gun, and gracefully strutted to the fellows
 gyaarah baje saare gaanv main halchal much gai
 Fair people came
 mohsin kii choti bahan ne daudkar bhishti uske haath se chin liya or maare khushi ke jo uchhali, to miyaan bhishti neeche aa gaye or surlok sidhaare
 On this, brother and sister got beaten up
 donon khub roe
 Hearing his mother's noise, he deteriorated and put them on top of each other
 ab miyaan hamid kaa haal suniye
 Ameena ran as soon as he heard her voice and picked her up and fell in love
 sahaja uske haath main chimata dekhakar vah chaunki
 "where was this tong?" ’‘kai paise main?’‘teen paise die
 'amina thrashed her chest
 yah kaisaa besamajh ladkaa he ki dopaher hua, kuch khaaya, na piya
 Brought what, tweezers
 saare meley main tuje or koi chiz na mili jo yah lohe kaa chimata uthaa laayaa?hamid ne apradhi-bhav se kaha-tumhaari oongliyaan tave se jal jaati thim, isliye maine ise liya
 The old lady's anger immediately turned into affection, and affection is not even that which appears, and spreads all its cuss in words
 yah mook sneh tha, khub thos, ras or swaad se bharaa hua
 How much sacrifice, how much harmony and wisdom in a child! How tempting it must have been to see others taking toys and eating sweets! How could he seize so much? There too it remained a memory of his old grandmother
 ameena kaa man gadgad ho gaya
 And now a very strange thing happened
 hamid ke is chimate se bhi vicitra
 The child Hamid played the part of old Hamid
 buudhiya ameena balika ameena ban gayi
 She began to cry
 daaman failaakar hamid ko duaen detii jaati thi or ansu kii badi-badi boonden giraati jaati thi
 What would Hamid understand its secret
 jammu-kashmir police kii aparaadh shakha ne antarraji online thag giroh kaa bhandaphod kiya he
 These gangs allegedly cheated people by pretending to be representatives of banks and insurance companies
 esaspi(aparaadh) mubsir latiphi ne bataaya ki hamen kathua ke vijay kumaar gupta se shikaayat mili ki kuch logon ne beemaa company kaa pratinidhi hone kaa bahaanaa kar usase 37 lakh rupaye thag liye

 Pakistan has lied only and only to the world in the fight against terrorism
 usne america kii aankh main dhul jhonki he auki taliban kii bharpoor madad kii he
 But one day his game was caught and today America sees Pakistan as a traitor
 ye khulaasa ek america patrkaar ne apni taaja kitaab main kiya he auki unhone saare tathy unalogon ke hawaale se rakhe hai jo america khufia agenciyon ke pramukh rahe hai
 The US also has evidence that Pakistan's army chief General Kiyani is a supporter of the terrorist organization Taliban and since he has known the truth, he has been carrying out continuous attacks within the border, regardless of Pakistan
 pakistan sarkaar kii baat america ne is baar bhi nahin suni
 On 23 January, when the US drone fired missiles on North Waziristan, Pakistan also complained
 uski fariyaad ke jawaab main america ke remote control se chalane vaale plane ne ek hafte ke andar hi pakistan par phir hamalaa kar diya
 The government and leaders of Pakistan kept saying to the US that let the Pak Army deal with the Taliban here
 lekin somvaar ko pakistan ke kurram kabeeley main america kaa bina payalat vaala jahaaz aayaa or do misile daag kar waapas laut gaya
 America has come to know the truth that Pakistan's army is a traitor
 pakistan main taliban or al qaayada ke thikaanon par drone hamalon kaa remote control pakistan se kareeb saat hazaar mile dur nevada main baithe siie ke afasaron ke haathon main he or siie ko saboot mil chuke hai ki pakistan kii army or iesai dagaabaaz he
 New York Times Chief Correspondent David E
 Sanger has revealed in his book that the US intelligence agency CIA and the National Security Agency have intercepted phone calls from top generals of the Pak Army and ISI
 ye phone sunne ke baad hi siie ke dimag kii ghanti baji ki pakistani fouj america ke liye aasteen kaa saanp he
 On one hand, it fights the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda militants, and on the other hand, the top officers of the Pak Army warn the terrorists that their targets are going to be attacked
 lihaaza america ne thaan liya he ki pakistan kii sarkaar chaahe jitna chikhe-chillaaye, lekin america ab aatank ke napak addon ko nahin chhodega
 Sanger has had access to the secret files of the White House and US intelligence agencies
 aisi hi ek sikret file ke hawaale se unhone sansanikhez khulaasa kiya he ki siie or neshnal security agency ne paak army or iesai ke aalaa afasaron kaa telephone tap kiya
 Among the calls that US intelligence agents heard, one of Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, General Ashfaq Parvez Kiyani, was telling Taliban militants their capital for Pakistan
 america kii neshnal security agency jaan chuki he ki paak army kaa cheef bhi america ke dushman al qaayada or taliban kaa dost he
 The biggest officer of Pakistan's army is the messiah of the dreaded Taliban militants
 sanger kii is kitaab main sabase sansanikhez khulaasa yahi he ki america khufia agenciyon ne pakistan ke army cheef kaa telephone bhi tap kiya
 It was only during General Kiani's phone tapping that the Pakistani Army and Taliban's most dangerous connection was exposed to American intelligence agencies
 taliban ke sabase puraane or behad khoonkhaar aatankwaadiyon main se ek maulavee jilaluddin hakqaani ko pakistan kii army ke mukhiya kiyani pakistan kii ranneeti main beshkeemtee maanate hai
 US intelligence agencies heard Kiyani with their ears saying that Taliban leaders like Maulvi Jalaluddin Haqqani are our strategic assets
 america khufia agenciyon main tu mikes ke naam se mashhoor do aalaa afasaron- mike mcconell or mike heden ke saamne kiyani kaa ye nayaa kirdaar tha
 He was suspicious of Kiyani only when he sat face to face with Kiyani
 mcconell ke mutabik, 'musharraf or kiyani ke saath meeting main maine bataaya ki 2007 main suicide bombers pakistan main kareeb teraa sau logon kii hatya kar chuke hai or 2008 main ye taadaad doguni ho sakati he
 i referred him to the interview of Osama bin Laden and his deputy and stated that Osama intended to overthrow the government of Pakistan
 jawaab main musharraf or kiyani donon kaa yahi kahana tha ki unhen osama ke intervyuu ke bare main pataa nahin he
 With Kiyani's reply, Two Mikes saw something black in the lentils and then after listening to Kiyani's talk on the phone, even the suspicion about the Pakistani Army's black intentions was over
 mcconell ne america raashtrapati ko bheji apni report main saaf-saaf likhaa "pakistani hukumat taliban or duusare girohon ke aatankwaadiyon ko lagaataar hathiyaar or duusare saamaan muhaiyaa kara rahi he, taaki ye aatankwaadi afghanistan main jaakar afghaan or nato kii fouj par hamale kar saken
 "only after the Pakistan Army's intentions were exposed, the US decided that now it will respond to Pakistan in the same way
 yani khule taur par dosti or apni marzi se aatankwaadi thikaanon par hamalaa
 The US had realized that there was no use in attacking the Pak Army, because the news of the attack would already reach the terrorists
 isliye ab wo pehle hamalaa karata he or uske baad ittila detaa he
 This disclosure by David Sanger has been described by former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf as rubbish
 kiyani ko chif of army staff banane vaale musharraf hi the
 Musharraf has warned the whole world that if the Pakistani army and ISI are weak, defeat in the war against terror is certain

 Indian cricketers have strongly criticized Australian umpire Daryl Harper for poor decisions in the first cricket Test against the West Indies
 team ke ek senior sadsy ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki puri team chaahati he ki tisare test main harper ampiring na karen
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said in the press conference after the match, "if the right decisions were taken, the match would have ended long ago and we would have been in the hotel
" harper 6 july se dominica main hone vaale test main bhi ampiring karenge
 a senior member of the team said, "we don't want him to umpire
" aap ise puri team kii pratikriya samaj sakate hai
 Dhoni did not name one of the umpires Ian Good (england) and Harper, but many Indian players took the name of Harper
 ek anya senior ne kaha, darryl harper chah par naabad
 Indian cricketers believe that Harper's attitude has been biased towards him over the past several years
 ek cricketer ne kaha, harper ne ek test main sachin tendulkar ko pagabaadha out diya tha, jab gend unke kandhe main lagi thi
 During the 1999–2000 tour of Australia, a ball from Glenn mcgrath hit Sachin's shoulder and Harper dismissed him
 baad main unhone kaha bhi, main chahta hum ki sachin ko out dene ke mere us faisle ko log bhul jaaen
 Only after this decision did the ICC decide to entrust the task to both neutral umpires in Test matches
 pehle test ke dauraan harper ne bharat ke khilaaf teen galtiyaan kin
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (16), Virat Kohli (15) and Suresh Raina (27) would have got their lives if the system of reviewing the umpires' decision was implemented
 pehle vivaadaaspad faisle kaa pehla shikaar kohli rahe
 a short ball from Fidel Edwards went outside the leg side
 carabian khilaadiyon ne kaich kii apil kii, haalanki kohli ampire ke faisle se santusht nahin the, par unke paas koi chaara nahin tha
 Later Raina was caught by West Indies captain Darren Sammy off Devendra Bishoo
 raina ne kaha ki gend unke balle ko chhukar nahin gai he, lekin ampire derel harper ne unhen out qaraar diya
 The replays clearly showed that the ball did not have a bat or gloves
 captain dhoni ko to nobal par out qaraar diya gaya
 He was caught in square cover off Fidel Edwards, but from replays it was clear that Bishoo's ball was a nooble

 yah kanoon ayog kii siforishein hai or ham sarkaar ke faisle kaa intjaar karenge
 As far as we know, the recommendations of the Law Commission are not binding until the government decides on it

 In the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, Congress MP from Jharkhand Pradeep Balmuchu photographed Jabjaya Bachchan, he would not even be blamed for how expensive it would cost him and his party

 peshawar main aatankwaadiyon ne jis ghinauni vaardatko anjaam diya uske liye khuda to kya shaitan bhi unhen maaf nahin karegaa
 After the suicide attack in school, when people came to know about the death count, it felt that this pain can kill anyone, it can shatter anyone's heart
 chote-chote bacchon kii skool kii vardi hari se laal ho gai
 Children were being shot from under the chair and bench
 hameshaa chahchahane vaala classroom masuumon kii laashon se pat chukaa tha
 Parents were searching for their children's corpses with bags and icards 
 bacchon ke baston main kitabe thim, haathon main kalam or aatankiyon ke bag main barood or haathon main ek-47
 All those children were then learning from the doctors in the halls of the school how a First Aid can be given to a wounded person
 or sitam dekhie thik usee vakt wo or unke saathi khud jakhmi ho kar gir rahe the yaa mar rahe the
 In the same classroom where children used to play hide and seek during the break in school, today the same children were trying unsuccessfully to hide under benches and chairs to save their lives
 pakistan kya duniya ne aatank kaa aisa kaayar or ghinauna cheharaa isse pehle kabhi nahin dekha tha
 On one side, children like unarmed innocent flowers and on the other hand terrorists worse than animals under the mask of Jihad
 is aatanki hamale ke baad wo bhi bhram tut gaya
 What kind of fight is this? Who is this fight for? Which jihad, which religion are you fighting, after entering into schools, who are firing bullets at small innocent children? Shot on the feet and arms of small children
 thodaa bade bachche dikhe to sidhe sir main goli maari
 When he saw the master, he was burnt alive
 peshawar ke rihaishi ilaake main aabaad is skool main sirf paak fouj hi nahin balki aam logon ke bachche bhi padhate the
 About 1500 students, including junior and senior classes, study here
 mangalvaar subah skool main do khaas chije thim
 The first school's largest hall housed a first aid learning session for junior children
 iske tahat peshawar ke kuch bade doctor bacchon ko first aid dene kii training de rahe the, jabaki senior bacchon ke unit test chal rahe the
 Then around half past ten in the morning, a carriage stops at the rear of the school
 us gaadi se paak rangers epasi kii vardi pahane aath-das log neeche utarate hai
 Everyone had big bags in their hands
 gaadi se utarane ke baad sabase pehle wo usee gaadi ko aag laga dete hai
 After this they break the back door of the school which was locked and inside the school, indiscriminately firing bullets
 skool main us vakt haul ke andar saikadon bachche ikattha the, first aid larning seshan ke liye
 On hearing the sound of firing, the school teacher immediately asks the children to hide here and there
 dare-sahame bachche bench or kursiyon ke neeche dubak jate hai
 But they do not escape the eyes of terrorists
 jis bachche par najar padati wo chota hota to uske baaju or pairon par goli maarthe
 He would shoot on his head as he grew up
 jo bhi baccha jahaan tha vahiin dar ke maare dubakaa padaa tha, kyonki jo jaraa sa hilta usee ko wo goli maarthe
 During the shootout, a terrorist caught a female teacher and burnt her alive in front of the children
 isi dauraan kuch aatankwaadi skool ke alag-alag classroom main ghus gaye to kuch canteen or staff room main
 All were simply firing indiscriminately, and the biggest targets were the children who were older
 puraa skool ab lagbhag aatankwaadiyon ke kabje main tha
 In the first half an hour, the school was full of the dead bodies of the children, then the sound of two explosions comes from inside the school
 haalanki tab tak paak sena or rangers ko bhi hamale kii khabar lag chuki thi or wo skool ke chaaron taraf fail bhi chuke the
 But then more than eight thousand children were present inside the school
 or un aath-das aatankwaadiyon ke bich wo do-teen fidain bhi the jo khud ko kabhi bhi bam se uda kar bacchon ko or nuksaan pahunchaa sakate the
 Hence the operation had to be done carefully
 par jaldi bhi kiya janaa tha
 Because every passing moment was increasing the number of corpses
 or ab tak teen ghante to guzar hi gaye the
 a total of 18 blasts were heard from inside the school during the encounter
 is dauraan aatankwaadi bhi lagaataar peeche hatate rahe
 By three o'clock in the evening, three of the four blocks of the school were occupied by the Pak Army, and during this time five terrorists had been killed
 magar skool ke sabase aakhri vaale hisse yani chauthe block se golibari kii aawaaj ab bhi aa rahi thi
 On the other hand, outside the school and the hospital scene was about to rip
 jo bachche baahar aa gaye unke gharavalon ko jaise unki duniya waapas mil gai
 Even if the injured world was not there, but the body of the parents whose bodies came broke
 skool ke baahar or aspataal main har taraf bas aansu or maatami cheekh thi
 The wretched scream that Pakistan made the whole world cry

 The former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, in his book 'india Unmade: How Modi Government Broke the Economy', in a shocking chapter on Modi and his government over the last four-and-a-half years, says that there is one thing he did but Other Prime Ministers did not
 sinha ne kaha ki unhone (piem modi) adhiktar pichley kaaryakramon ko apane daayre main liya or unka naam badal diya, jisase sara shrey or gaurav unke saath jud gaya
 Sinha, a critic of the bjp-led government, has dedicated this book to all those who are not afraid to come forward with the truth
 unhone kaha, "modi ek aise insaan hai, jo sabhi chijen khud ke liye karnaa chaahate hai
 "the bureaucrat-turned-politician, 81-year-old Sinha, in the chapter" Hell Caesar: Modi's Style of Functioning "said," Modi has centralized all the decision-making powers of the Indian government, including some select officials of his Prime Minister's Office
 Help
 " sinha vaajapeyi sarkaar main vitt or videsh mantri rahe the
 In the book, co-written with journalist Aditya Sinha, Sinha said, "although he is known to be interested in power point presentations rather than reading lots of files
 yah dukh kii baat he
 This means that he does not want to know the specifics accumulated in institutional memory
 shaayad yah ek aise vyakti ke liye upyukt he jiske bauddhik prashikshan main saavdhaanee kaa abhaav he (vastav main, kisi ke paas sampurna raajnneeti vigyaan main uski ucch shiksha degree dikhaai nahin detii he)
 "he said that the administration of the Government of India is being run by three centers, first Prime Minister and his office, second Finance Minister and his office and third NITI Aayog
 pehle ek rajaneta aksar yojana ayog kii adhyakshata karata tha lekin ab vah chup he or use niti ayog se badal diya gaya he, jahaan modi ne aise log baithaae hai, jinka sarkaar par shunya prabhaav he
 He said that this has caused two drivers of the government
 diggaj rajaneta ne kaha ki sabhi jaanate hai ki vitt mantri kaa sarkaar main kaisaa prabhaav he, jise nakaara nahin ja saktaa ki kareeb kareeb shunya or vah apane khud ke mantralay main chizon par jor dene main sakasham nahin hai
 He said, "after all, why his finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia was involved in the notorious demonetization decision, the finance minister himself was in the dark
" vitt sachiv kii pradhanmantri ke prati nikatataa gujarat ke samay kii he
 "he said Modi is unfortunately a person who is desperate for institutions
 unke khud main vishwaas ne unhen is baat ke prati andhaa bana diya he ki vah koi raja nahin he, vah keval ek sansadeey dal ke pramukh hai, jiske paas bahumat he, jo unhen sarkaar banane main sakasham banaata he or us sarkaar kii simaaen samvidhan main nirdhaarit hai
 Sinha said that the cabinet is collectively responsible to the Parliament
 lekin ek santhaan ke rup main yah pradhanmantri ke faislon ke liye rabar stamp main tabdeel ho gai he
 Sinha said, "it is said that most cabinet ministers are not allowed to talk until their ministry's decision is finalized
" modi mantriyon ke vibhinn faislon par khadey hue hai or unke paas unase milane ke liye koi samay nahin he kyonki isse unhen koi fark nahin padataa
 Modi only rules through bureaucrats and will and that seems to be his mantra

 tahalaka ke sansthaapak patrkaar tarun tejpal ke khilaaf yon utpeedan ke maamle main goa kii adaalat ne aarope tay kar die hai
 This decision of the court has increased Tarun's difficulties
 apni kalam or khufia camere ke istemaal se tarun ne puure desh main tahalaka machaaya
 Massive revelations spread sensations in the corridors of power
 unki aisi pahchaan bani ki log aankh mundakar un par bharosa karne lage
 But years of earnings, name and fame were ruined by just one step
 apni hi team kii mahila patrkaar ke saath yon shoshan ke aarope main ghire tarun tejpal kaa ab kanoon se bachanaa naammumkin ho gaya he
 On November 7, 2013, Tehelka's Think Fest was going on at a Five Star Hotel in Goa on Saturday
 tahalakaake editor in chif or jane-maane patrkaar tarun tejpal samet duniya ke kai mashhoor chehre is fest kaa hissaa the
 And among these famous faces, there was also a face of that anonymous girl, who had come to perform her duty in this fest, but before she returned from here after paying her duty, she herself met the evil intentions of her own boss Tarun Tejpal
 Became a victim
 ladki kii maane to tejpal ne uske saath ek nahin, balki do-do baar jyaadati kii or munh kholane par bure anjaam kii dhamkee bhi di
 After the complaint made by Tehelka Managing Editor Shoma Chaudhary, the girl told the Goa police the whole story with her, the listeners just kept listening
 kyonki ye tejpal kaa wo cheharaa tha, jo ab tak kisi ne nahin dekha tha
 According to the girl's statement to the Goa police, that night when she was returning from leaving a guest to her room, she found her boss Tarun Tejpal in front of an elevator in Block 7 of the same hotel
 tejpal ne guest ko dobaaraa jagaane kii baat kah achaanak use waapas usee lift ke andar khinch liya, lekin abhi ye ladki kuch samaj paati ki isi bich tejpal ne lift ke batan kuch aise dabaane shuru kiye, jisase naa to lift kahin ruke or naa hi darwaja khule
 And then Tejpal did what he did in this closed lift, when his secrets were open, often due to his sting operation and revelations, there was a panic in the life of Tarun Tejpal, who created panic in political circles
 tejpal kii beti kii acchhee dost he peeditagova police ko die gaye bayaan main peedit ladki ne bataaya ki tarun tejpal ne tab lift main hi usase chhedchhad shuru kar di
 This act of Tejpal was a big shock for him, even more shock than that, because till now he had considered Tejpal as his father's friend and Tejpal's daughter himself is his good friend
 peedit ladki ke mutabik jab tejpal uske saath band lift main jyaadati kar rahe the, wo in rishton kii duhai de rahi thi
 Moreover, he reminded Tejpal of his friendship with his daughter, but there was a ghost on Tejpal's head
 haalat ye ho gai ki jab thodi der baad lift rukii, to wo kisi tarah apane kapade sambhalakar lift se nikal bhaagi, lekin ye is ladki kii pareshaaniyon kaa ant nahin tha
 The second time also in the elevator was molesting that night, this girl told her friend on her phone, besides her boyfriend, about this incident, but the next day, once again, Tejpal did the same thing with her in an elevator of the same hotel
 Repeated and now everything was out of tolerance for him
 or isi ke baad is ladki ne apni best frand or tejpal kii beti ko uske pita kii puri karatuut bayaan kar di
 But know, what Tejpal's daughter replied then, if the girl believes, she said that she had earlier seen her father doing this to another woman when she was only 13 years old
 yon shoshan ko lekar ab tak sirf baaten ho rahi thim
 Accusations were being made, answers were being sought for the charges
 lekin ab jo kuch hua wo yakeenan tarun tejpal par baari padane vaala he
 On the one hand, the Delhi High Court has reserved the decision on Tejpal's anticipatory bail till 29 November, on the other hand, the victim girl has uncovered a copy of Tejpal's misdeeds before the magistrate in Goa
 goa police ke saamne aupchaarik shikaayat darj karaane ke baad peedit ladki ne goa jaakar magistrate ke saamne bhi bayaan darj kara diya
 The countdown to the arrest of Tarun Tejpal on charges of sexual exploitation and rape has begun
 peedit ladki kii shikaayat par goa police tarun tejpal ko pehle hi panaji ke donna pola thane main hajiri lagane kaa saman jari kar chuki he
 After recording the statement before the magistrate, now the warrant of arrest can be issued at any time
 magistrate ko die 22 pej ke bayaan main ladki ne puure tafsil se bataaya he
 What happened, the girl had given the details of what happened to her at the Think Fest on the night of 7 and 8 November, in her statement, the girl has clarified that whatever happened happened against her will
 tejpal kii taraf se sahmati kii baat uthaane se uski manahani ho rahi he
 He has also given details of conversations with Tehelka's colleagues present at Think Fest
 iske alaava tejpal ko bheje esemas or email kii copy bhi jamaa kii he
 In the statement, the girl also said that managing editor Shoma Chaudhary did not help her
 balki tejpal ke rishtedaaron kii taraf se us par police main bayaan nahin dene kaa dabaav bhi banaaya gaya
 According to the Goa police, the girl's complaint and statement made to the magistrate match the e-mail sent to Tehelka management after the incident
 tejpal is ghatana ko lekar bhale hi apane bayaan badalte rahe, lekin peedit ladki apane bayaan par adig he
 The Goa Police has completed the initial investigation on its part and to clamp down on Tejpal
 lekin ise lekar tejpal or unke karibiyon kaa kahana he ki unhen fansaaya ja rahaa he or ise goa kii bijepi sarkaar uksaa rahi he
 But Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar dismissed those allegations outright
 haalanki mukhyamantri giraftaar ke sawaal par jawaab taal gaye
 Saying that this is a police matter and it is better to leave it to them
 karrwai shuru ho chuki he
 The summons for Tejpal to appear before the Goa Police has also been issued
 police kaa kahana he, ki tejpal agar saman kii andekhi karte hai, to unke khilaaf gaiyr jamaanti warrant jari kiya jayega
 Tejpal is getting caught in the trap of ahista-ahista law that in the coming time, breathing in the open air can prove to be a dream for him
 dilli hai court se philhal raahat nahin mili or duusari taraf goa police ne unhen poochtacha ke liye saman bhejkar usee goa main haazir hone ko kaha he jis goa se is scandle kii shuruuaat hui thi
 The crime branch of Goa Police is investigating this entire case
 tejpal ke khilaaf yon shoshan kaa maamla aane ke baad goa police ne hi balaatkaar kaa maamla darj kiya tha
 After this, the Goa police also came to his home in Delhi to inquire Tejpal, but there was no inquiry
 is bich goa sarkaar ke rukh se saaf he ki wo maamle ko aise hi nahin chhodane vaali he
 Also earning a lot of money, Tarun Tejpal gave journalism a new identity
 sting oparation ke zarie bade-bade khulaase kiye
 But as he rose to the top ranks of journalism, he also spread his business rapidly
 karodon ke maalik tejpal ab club or resort ke dhandhe main bhi paanv pasaar rahe the, lekin achaanak hi unke sitare gardish main pahunch gaye
 After the news person himself came in the news, now everyone's eyes have turned towards the heap of Tejpal's property as it is also revealed that he has built a good business empire while living in Tehelka

 He said that if his government comes, he will give tabs to children up to class VIII, which will improve the education situation in the state
 uddhav ne kaha, ‘bala sahib ne bacchon ke baste ke boj par chintaa jataai
 Said, what is this, the animals have kept the children
 to maine thaan liya ki bacchon ko baste ke boj se bachaana he
 i have thought that after forming the Mahayuti Sarkar, i will give the tab to the children from class VIII

 The country wanted change
 chunaav ke pehle dilli aayaa tha to kaha tha ki desh ko cheharaa chahie
 Who will be the leader of the country? So Narendra Bhai appeared

 Now it has come to Maharashtra
 to logon ko cheharaa chahie
 If they vote, they need a face

 If people want to trust me, then what is the harm in them? Whether i am an ally or someone, i am good in people's mirror
 yah poochne par ki aapke sahyogi to cheharaa badalanaa chaahate hai, uddhav ne kaha, ‘mujhe laga nahin ki bijepi cheharaa badalanaa chaahate hai

 aap unhen daagi kahenge
 So i would say that i am proud of them
 janata ke liye ladate hue agar daag lagate hai to daag achche hai
 But there is a matter of financial or any other type of scam, then such people will have to go to jail
 ’unhone kaha, ‘desh kaa kanoon angrejon ke jamaane se chalaa aa rahaa he
 Those who were our revolutionaries in his time even got hanged
 is kanoon ko badalanaa hi chahie
 Asked on how many seats Shiv Sena will contest and BJP on how many seats, Uddhav joked, 'the discussion is still on
 ham jitani siton par nahin ladenge wo utane par ladenge
 After this, he said seriously, 'it should be everyone's dream to move their party forward
 jab samay aata he tab thik se faisla hoga
 Judging from that it is ground reality, will be decided

 In Maharashtra, we never forced language on anyone
 ’mumbai main praant vaad he yah poochne par unhone kaha, ‘jab ham karen to yah praantvaad lagata he

 Although these people have already defrauded hundreds of people, they kept escaping due to cleverly taking money or accepting cash
 is baar 12veen or graduate paas do yuvakon ko mantralay memnaukridilane ke naam par kareeb 15 lakh rupee check ke jariye lene se inaki kalai khul gai
 After his arrest, hundreds of unemployed unemployed people from various areas of the state lodged a complaint about being a victim of fraud

 The fraudster Bunty, Babli and his team had opened an employment office in Devendra Nagar of Raipur under the name of Enclave Group
 aarope he ki ye log yahaan par berozegaar yuvaaon ko bulaakar naukari dilaane kaa sapana dikhaate or phir afasaron ko ghoose dene ke naam par moti rakam anthte the
 There were 25 unemployed daily, the victim of fraud is being told that both Shalini Verma and Rupendra Verma are husband and wife, while Baby Rao is his close friend
 yahi teenon is group ko chalaate the
 Shalini was an HR head and the company used to trick the unemployed to get jobs in various government offices to the best of their ability
 rojaanaa is daftar main 20-25 berozegarangika shikaar hote the
 The unemployed people used to come to get jobs, there was a crowd of people coming from urban and rural areas to get jobs

 The police have arrested the three accused
 aropiyon ne sirf trivendra hi nahin, balki us din 20 logon se 15 lakh 75 hajaar rupee kii thagi karne kii baat kabuuli he

 During college time, when the horse was moving the path of the Sangh, a person familiar with his art of horsemanship asked him to handle a horse

 lambey or hatte-katte 62 varshiya om prakaash maathur ab tak bijepi main un-un rajyon kii jimmedaari sambhaal chuke hai, jahaan-jahaan party bidakati he yani sankat main hoti he
 In his spare time, he cultivates hitech in his one and a half acre farm in Bali tehsil of Pali district of Rajasthan
 gulab kii kheti, papeeta, neembu aadi ke video apane ipad par dikhaate hue maathur bataate hai ki unhen kheti ke liye kai rashtriya puraskaar mil chuke hai
 The specialty of Mathur, who prefers simple life and only dal-roti in food, is that he says his words with conviction on the basis of facts, even if the person in front is Narendra Modi
 lekin raajnneeti main ab tak sirf ek baar rajyasabha saansad rahane or baaki samay alag-thalag rahane ke sawaal par ve kehete hai ki alag-thalag vah hota he jo kamjor hota he
 Mathur, who has never understood his conscience, does not like to see his identity associated with Modi or Amit Shah
 rajasthan main sanghathan kaushal ke jariye bijepi kaa aadhaar badhaane ke baad prabharee ke rup main madhya pradesh main 2002 main uma bharti ko bataur mukhyamantri ummidavaar party main sweekaaryata dilaane, gujarat main party kii antarkalah ko khatm karne, haal hi main maharashtra main shivasena se alag hokar bijepi kaa paracham lahraane vaale maathur ko ab upi jaise bade soobe kii jimmedaari saunpi gai he
 Mathur, who is considered to be the most special strategist of Narendra Modi, had a special conversation with India Today chief correspondent Santosh Kumar
 unke saath baatcheet ke pramukh ansh:aapako bijepi ne sabase bade lakshya mishan upi kaa jimmaa saunpa he
 How big a challenge is this? See, the challenge is very big, there are no two opinions in it
 party ne mujh par bahut bharosa kiya, upi kii jimmedaari di, jahaan 403 sadsy hai
 Mainly i am the man of the organization
 main is chunauti ko swikar karata hum or koshish karuunga ki upi kii team ke saath baithkar aane vaale chunaav main safalataa mili
 As found in the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa chunaav main upi main modi kaa vikaas kaa agenda chalaa, lekin teen maah baad hi vidhansabha upachunaav main yogi adityanath ne kathor hindutv ko mudda banaaya or party haari
 So what would be your strategy? Surely we have lost 9 out of 11 seats
 kahin na kahin kuch kaaran rahe honge
 Will analyze it
 lekin narendra modi ne jo hamen vikaas kaa vijan diya he, vahi vijan lekar upi main bhi hamen aage baduya padegaa
 Will the BJP project any Chief Minister in UP? As far as my personal opinion is concerned, i do not think that the BJP will take any such view
 lekin party ne kuch soch rakhaa he to main party se baat karke hi is par sahi uttar de saktaa hum
 Earlier BJP used to move ahead by projecting face in states
 lekin ab aisa karti nahin dikh rahi to kya ab bijepi kaa bhi congresikaran ho gaya he?ise congresikaran nahin kahana chahie
 a good political party is the one who takes decisions based on the current political situation
 aap sangh prishthbhumi se hai
 The bjp-sangh has never been person-centric
 abhi sab kuch modi ke ird-gird ghumta kyon dikh rahaa he?main aapako karact karnaa chaahunga
 It is true that things are revolving around Modi
 lekin modi bhi party ke kaaryakarta pehle hai
 He too has developed his personality as a worker
 modi ne 12 saal se kaaryakarta ke rup main gujarat main jo jameen khodi he or desh ke saamne jo vishay rakhaa he, ve pramukh the or swaabhaavik rup se uskaa credit unako jaataa he
 But the vision is what he learned in his childhood in the Sangh, the vision is to take everyone along
 jo gandhi ji ke naam se swatchta abhiyaan chalaae, nehru ke naam se bacchon main swasthya kaa dhyaan karaae, aise modi ko vyaktinishth kahana bilkul galat he
 Modi talks about everyone's support and development
 lekin muslim samaaj ko abhi bhi unase parhez he
 How will you win their trust in UP? Muslim society has been misled about BJP in many ways
 lekin dhire-dhire hamen unamem vishwaas jamaana chahie, vishwaas jamaayenge or uskaa drishy agar aapako dekhnaa he to gujarat main jaakar dekhnaa chahie, jahaan muslim log badi sankhya main bijepi ko vot dete hai
 Maneka Gandhi had spoken of Varun Gandhi to be the CM project
 
 
 mujhe lagata he ki rajnatik kshetra main kisi bhi varisht netaa yaa padaadhikari ko apane nijee vichaar saarvajanik nahin karne chahie
 The credit of up's victory in the Lok Sabha was given to Amit Shah, while in Gujarat you won all 26 seats while in charge
 aapkaa naam adhyaksh pad kii daud main bhi aayaa, lekin shah baaji maar gaye
 Do you think there was a chance? i do not think it is any effort
 ham sab sirf nimitt maatr hote hai chaahe amit shah hon yaa main
 Let me tell you that on 13 September 2013, Modi was declared the PM candidate and till 10 May 2014 that person has done austerity
 5,800 kaarykram unhone akele kiye
 The person did public awareness all over the country
 ham to nimitt maatr the
 That is why no one should become president, become Amit or even if i become someone else
 hamaari party main iskaa koi mahatv nahin he
 But Modi called Amit Shah the man of the match from a public forum
 
 
 
 Well, after all, Amit won the most seats in such a big state
 modi ji ne mujhe bhi dhanyavad diya he
 In UP, do you compete with BSP or SP? If a political party goes to the electoral battle, then it considers every party, big and small
 vah sajag hokar jaataa he kyonki chaaron taraf se akraman ho saktaa he
 How will my party fight every attack, i will only worry about it
 aapako samanvay kii raajnneeti main maahir mana jaataa he, lekin vah samanvay grih pradesh main vasundhara ji ke saath kyon nahin dikhataa?main to kal hi vasundhara ji ke yahaan naashtaa karke aayaa hum
 The media bounces all these things
 main kabhi bhi in choti chizon main nahin ulajhata
 But now Lalit Modi, who is considered special of Vasundhara, tweeted, "mathur should be made the CM of Rajasthan? Don't know why
 kya likhaa vah vahi jane
 i have no acquaintance with Lalit Modi
 aapako lucky prabharee mana jaataa he, kya khaas ranneeti hoti he aapaki?kamjor maansikta vaala hi lucky jaisi chizon main bharosa karata he
 i dig the earth myself
 maine gujarat main is baar pej pramukh kii nai parampara daali
 In this way, i created a separate army of 28 to 34,000 workers in every Lok Sabha constituency
 mujh lagata he ki rajnatik kshetra main homework kii aadat main kami ai he
 If there is homework and a little social, political equation is taken care of, then the public supports
 aapako lagaataar badi jimmedaari di ja rahi he or charchaa he ki bhavishya main aapako rajasthan kaa siem banaaya ja saktaa he
 i never expected all these things, neither from Narendra Modi nor from God
 isliye agar-magar ke sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin dena chahta
 You are accused of breaking the Shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra
 kya kahenge?main aapako kahana chahta hum ki uddhav or mujhe saath bithakar intervyuu len to doodh kaa doodh, pani kaa pani ho jayega
 But if you accuse me, i accept it
 sangh-bijepi ke rishton par hameshaa sawaal uthta rahaa he ki vah dakhal detaa he
 The government has retreated under this pressure from labor reform, what do you think? This is the perception of all of you
 modi swayan sangh ke swayamsevak hai
 The Sangh never interferes with any BJP work
 sangh hamaara maardarshak he or ham samay-samay par salaah karte hai
 i too have been in politics for 40 years
 pradeshon main prabharee rahaa
 The Sangh never interfered
 bijepi main sangh ke prachaarkon kii ek nai fouj bahut teji se aage ai he
 Manohar Lal Khattar was made CM
 aapako jimmedaari di gai, sunil bansal ji ko banaaya gaya
 
 
 You can call Manohar a former pracharak
 main bhi hum, narendra bhai bhi hai
 If you have done the work of the Sangh, someone will come
 sirf raajnneeti hi kyon, vyapaar-seva sabhi kshetron main purv prachaarak aage bade hai
 If someone goes beyond his capacity, then to think that the campaigners are being pushed forward is a completely wrong notion
 abhi sunil bansal upi ke sanghathan mantri banaae gaye hai, unke bare main aapaki raay
 
 bansal ji rajasthan se gaye hai
 Has worked as ABVP there for years
 achche sanghathak hai or mehnatee hai
 i am young and i will run as much as i can
 hamane maharashtra main bhi unhen lagaaya tha
 He coordinated
 kaha jaataa he ki congress ke samay neshnal adwijuri council thi, lekin ab nagpur adwijuri council haaavee he
 
 ye hawa main tairti baaten hai
 In politics, things should also be floating in the air
 upi main bijepi puraane chehron ke saath khadi rahi he
 The new generation did not stand
 to kya aap kuch moolbhoot badlaav karenge?hamen puraane logon ke anubhav kaa laabh milegaa
 But a large area is untouched by us
 meraa öytn un kshetron main achche chehron ko nikaalkar aage laane kaa hoga
 The membership campaign has started the process of organization election
 nayaa network banegaa to main yah dhyaan rakhuunga ki isamen sabakaa pratinidhitiv aae or ham ek hi ghere main nahin rah jaaen
 You are considered very close to Modi
 unke bare main kaha jaataa he ki ve sirf ekatarfa samvaad karte hai, kisi kii sunate nahin hai
 How is your experience? This perception is very common among people, media
 main 2004 se gujarat kaa prabharee hum
 Two Lok Sabha, two assembly elections were held
 mere saamne ek bhi ghatana, aisi baat nahin ai jisamen modi ne koi baat aapke shabdon ke mutabik kahi ho
 They listened to the core team
 merit par nirnay karte the
 i can say that this notion is baseless
 lekin abhi mantri bhi unke nirdesh ke bina kaam karne se dar rahe hai
 
 
 There is nothing like this, all media has created perception
 haa, itnaa jarur he ki jo mantri banane ke baad do-do maheene tak sirf maalaaen hi pahante rahete the, ab ve nahin gum paa rahe
