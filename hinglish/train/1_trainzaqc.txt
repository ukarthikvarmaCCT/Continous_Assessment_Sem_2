 While dismissing the Lokpal Bill under consideration in the Rajya Sabha as 'weak' and ineffective, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that its passage will not benefit anyone except Congress and Rahul Gandhi will be passed by it
 Credit will be given unhone kaha ki vah anna hajaare ke is rukh se dukhi hai ki agar upree sadan main vichaaradhin lokapal vidheyak paarit hota he to vah apana anshan tod denge
 Kejriwal cautioned that the proposed law would not stop corruption but would work for 'protection of the corrupt'
 kejariwal ne kaha ki kisi mantri ke bare main bhul jaaie, agar yah vidheyak paarit ho gaya to chuuhe ko bhi jail kii sajaa nahin hogi
 i can assure you that there will not be a single conviction from this Lokpal in the next 10 years
 main is baat se chintit hum ki is lokapal vidheyak se kisko phayda milegaa
 i think the Congress will benefit and its Vice President Rahul Gandhi will be given some credit for its passage
 unhone daawa kiya ki jab tak sibiai ko swatantra nahin banaaya jaataa, jiskaa is vidheyak main praavdhaan nahin he, tab tak bhrashtachar ke maamalon main ek bhi doshasiddhi nahin hogi
 The AAP leader said that in the 50 years of CBI, only four leaders have been convicted by the agency
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki ve jinke khilaaf jaanch karte hai unheen raajnneetik baas ko report karte hai
 Kejriwal said that had the CBI been independent, there would have been a possibility that the Prime Minister could have been jailed in the 2G or coal scam
 party ne lokapal vidheyak ko 'kamjor' bataaya or kaha ki yah bhrashtachar ko nahin rokegaa balki 'bhrashton ke sangrakshan' kaa kaam karegaa
 Criticizing the current form of the bill, Kejriwal said that the bill passed on August 11, 2011, had a provision of independent investigative machinery for the Lokpal
 unhone kaha ki lekin aaj, ham is kamjor lokapal ko sweekaar kaise kar sakate hai
 We will continue our agitation for Jan Lokpal and tell the people that the Parliament has failed to fulfill the three assurances given to halt Hazare's fast
 lokapal vidheyak ko ek baar paarit karne ke baad isamen sanshodhan karne ke sujhaavon par kejariwal ne kaha ki jab ve kishton main bhrashtachar nahin karte to ve kanoon kishton main kyon dena chaahate hai? sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue unhone kaha ki ve kya sochate hai, yah retail shaap he yaa kya he? ve ek baar main kadaa kanoon kyon nahin laate? When asked about the formation of the government in Delhi, Kejriwal said that they are waiting for the stand of Congress and BJP on 18 important issues
 unhone kaha ki vah 'aamasahmati kii raajnneeti' karne kii koshish kar rahe hai or jimmedaariyon se nahin bhaag rahe hai or isliye unhone donon dalon kaa rukh poocha he, jo unki sarkaar ko 'samarthan' dene ko taiyaar hai
 Kejriwal said that the Congress has said that they are giving unconditional support, while the BJP is giving constructive support
 raajnneetik sthiti main, iskaa matlab yah hua ki ham aapako sarkaar nahin chalaane denge or raajnneetik evam prem main kuch bhi bina shart nahin hota he, kuch sharten hoti hai
 He said that he should stop playing politics and should do some serious work and give his answer
 agar teen dal bhaajapa, congress or aap taiyaar hai to sabhi mudde minuton main sulajh jaaenge
 The AAP leader said that they will go to the public with the responses of both the parties and we will make it public and put it in public meetings and ask for their opinion
 unhone kaha ki ham congress or bhaajapa se jawaab milane ke baad 270 nagar nigam vaardon main saarvajanik sabhaayen karenge
 If people ask us to form a government then we will do it and show how the government runs

 pehle to sabhapati ne sadan kii kaarywahi 15 minute ke liye sthagit kii lekin baavjood iske jab karrwai dobaaraa shuru hui tab bhi AIADMK saansadon kaa hangaamaa jari rahaa
 Chairman m Venkaiah Naidu repeatedly requested the sitting mps to sit

 In religious texts, 8 days of Holashtak are considered inauspicious for Manglik works, there are many beliefs behind it
 aisa mana jaataa he ki bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya bhang karne kii koshish karne par bholenath se kaamdev ko phalgun maheene kii ashtami ko bhashm kar diya tha
 As the god of love, Kama Dev, was consumed, a wave of mourning spread throughout the world
 tab kaamdev kii patni rati ne shivaji se kshamaa yachana kii or bholenath ne kaamdev ko phir se jivit karne kaa aashwaasan diya
 After this, people celebrated by playing color
 aaj se shuru ho rahaa he holashtak, jaane kyon mana jaataa he ashubh
 
 
 Some texts suggest that Prahlada started torturing his father Hiranyakashyap 8 days before Holi and tried to kill Prahlad on the eighth day in the lap of Holika
 lekin aag main naa jalane kaa vardaan paane vaali holikaa jal gai thi or balak prahlaad batch gaya tha
 8 days of torture of God devotee Prahlada is not considered auspicious
 isliye koi bhi shubh kaam naa karne kii parampara he
 What tasks should not be done, it is very important to have auspicious time to do any mangical work
 isse us kaary ke safal hone kii sambhaavna or bad jaati he
 Therefore, auspicious work such as marriage, home entry, starting a new business, etc
 should not be done in Holashtak
 koun se kaary kar sakate hanaise kaary jo hamaare liye bahut jaruri hon yaa janm or mrityu se sambandhit kaary kiye ja sakate hai
 Holashtak prevails in Punjab, Himachal, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in northern India
 baaki duusare pradeshon main iskaa vishesh vichaar nahin kiya jaataa he
 Holashtak is the time to change the weather, the winter is going on and the summer season is knocking, in this sequence of changing the weather, the mind and body also have a lot of influence, in such a time, by taking important decisions or doing manglish work
 Holika Dahan should be avoided as well as all the vices are destroyed, gulal flying in the sky, color, abir, create new euphoria in the mind
 tab holi ke baad aap prasann man se sahi faisle or ahm kaary kar sakate hai
 So if some work is not very important, then stop a little and start after Holi, you will definitely get success

 At this time, it is being taught to give children a new way of attentiveness

 Delhi Police Crime Branch has asked for more time to file a status report

 The magistrate said, "I see the quality of the complainant's plea that the police has failed to file the ATR and delayed it
" paristhitiyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sambandhit sanyukt police ayukta ko nirdeshit kiya jaataa he ki maamle ko dekhen, jaanch main teji laaen, taaki atiar ko is adaalat ke samaksh agali taarikh par yaa isse pehle daayar kiya ja sake
 In February this year, a video of anti-national slogans was revealed at Ramjas College, Delhi University
 is video main left samarthit chaatr sanghathan ke kaaryakarta kashmir or bastar ko lekardesh virdohi narebajikarte dikh rahe hai
 At the same time, ABVP had alleged that the people who raised anti-national slogans at Ramjas College on 22 February were chaotic elements from outside
 police ne is maamle main apni states report main kaha he ki usne maamle kii jaanch ko lekar 62 gavaahon se poochtacha kii he
 Which includes students and police personnel
 abhi maamle main exiar darj nahin hui he
 The report states that the video recording presented by the media and other eyewitnesses and a CD given by complainant Vivek Garg have also been investigated by the committee
 isamen main kaha gaya he ki jaanch antim charan main he or ise puraa karne ke liye vakt maanga
 The complainant and advocate Garg contended that despite several occasions no ATR was filed and the court should initiate the process of directing the investigating agency to register an FIR if the police did not file ATR
 adaalat ne rekhaankit kiya ki police se chah march ko atiar maangi gai thi or tab se report daayar karne ke kai maukey die gaye
 a year ago on 8 November 2016, the Central Government announced demonetisation
 aaj jabaki iskaa ek saal puraa ho rahaa he to ye jaananaa jaruri he ki aazaadee ke baad logon kii jeb se jude is sabase bade faisle se aakhir hasil kya hua? aisa isliye bhi jaruri he kyonki sarkaar ke mahaj is ek faisle se aam aadmi bank se apana hi paisa nikaalane ke liye lambii qatari main lagane ke liye majaboor ho gaya tha

 However, black cash was likely to be even less

 The closure of big notes only hurts those who had deposited their black money in the form of cash at the time of this decision

 Demonetisation was a waste of 80 percent of the currency in circulation in the country

 Cash can become legal only if either it is accounted for in the tax account or in the bank account

 Whatever the estimates about the size of the economy of the entire black money with RBI, as far as the cash economy is concerned, the Reserve Bank of India measures and records it every quarter
 chunkiarabiichhape gaye harek note kaa record rakhata he, isliye mani in cirkulation kaa aankada, nakad arthvyavastha kii gananaa he
 After a year's pain, the country is restless to know what the benefits of this sacrifice are
 According to the Reserve Bank data, as of March 2016, about Rs 14 thousand 180 billion in cash was in circulation in 500 and 1000 notes
 isamen se 30 fisadi yani 4,254 arab rupee kii nakadi bainkon or duusari sarkari agenciyon ke paas thi jabaki 70 fisadi yani 9,926 arab rupee aam janata (mani vid public) ke paas the
 Significantly, after a similar decision in 1978, 75 per cent of the amount was returned to the central bank treasury
 jabaki bachi hui 25 fisadi nakadi arthvyavastha se baahar ho gai thi
 This 25 per cent was considered black money at that time and this was the benefit of the government's decision
 is baar logon ke paas notebandi se pehle jo 9
 There was cash of Rs 9 lakh crore, in which it was estimated that only 7 to 8 lakh crore rupees would be returned to the banks and the remaining cash would remain out of the system as cash
 lekin arabiai dwaara jari naveenatam aankadon ne is ummid par pani pher diya or janata ke paas padi lagbhag puri nakadi bainkon main waapas jamaa kara di gai
 It is worth noting that the return of the entire cash was lost on the profit which the Reserve Bank had hoped for
 mana ja rahaa tha ki rigerv bank is atirikt aamadani ko sarkaar ke nivesh ke liye labhaansh ke taur par de sakati he
 But the RBI data dashed this expectation of the central government

 Nature has caused massive destruction in Uttarakhand
 sabase zyada barbaadi kedarnath main machi he
 Debris and water are scattered throughout the area
 shraddhaluon ko tehraane ke liye bane hotel or loj nestnabud ho chuke hai, lekin itani tabaahi ke baavjood baba kedarnath kaa mandir bachaa rah gaya he
 In the midst of this disaster, Baba Kedarnath's temple has suffered some damage, but this Baba's Dham is still safe
 saadhe 11 hajaar feet kii oonchai par baba kedaranpath virajte hai
 Just now, Kedarnath's identity has survived with the trust of this temple
 badal fatne se yahaan aisi tabaahi machi ki puure kedarnath mandir ke aas-paas kaa manjar hi badal gaya
 Seeing this havoc of this abode of devotion and faith, the mind gets enchanted
 kedarnath bhagwaan shiv ke 12 jyotirlingon main ek he, lekin jal pralay ne kedarnath ko puri tarah tahas nahas kar diya
 In the midst of this ruin, if Bhole Shankar's temple is left, but he is also half immersed in debris
 jis 6 feet ke chabutare par yah mandir bana he wo kahin najar nahin aa rahaa
 It is reported that the Rambara market near Kedarnath is completely washed away
 kedarnath mandir kaa mukhya dwaar bhi pani ke tej bahaav kii chapet main aane se bah gaya he
 The lodges and hotels made for the stay of the devotees have also got contained in the water stream
 ab vahaan sivaae malbe or pattharon ke or kuch najar nahin aa rahaa
 In this area, many hotels built for the devotees were washed away, thousands of devotees are still stranded, not knowing how many are missing
 pichley 48 ghanton se lagaataar kedarnath main rescue oparation jari he, sena ke jawan helicopter se logon ko bachaane main jute hue he, rescue oparation main jute afasaron kaa kahana he ki aisi tabaahi pehle kabhi nahin dekhi gai
 So far, around 500 people have been evacuated from here
 sirf 6 maheenon ke liye khulte hai patakedarnath ke pat saal main keval 6 maheenon ke liye khulte hai
 Kedarnath's skins are closed during winter and hence devotees wish to reach here in turn and earn merit while the temple is open
 apane aradhy ke darshanon kii laalasaa liye kai yatri darshanon ke liye aae hue the
 Some of them died in death and many people are praying to reach home safely due to being stuck in the way
 punyadaayi hoti he ek jhalkadwadash jyotirlingon main se ek baba kedarnath ke darshan kii raah aasaan nahin, lekin baba kii ek jhalak bhi itani punyadaayi hoti he ki bhakt bas khinche chale aate hai
 The journey to Kedarnath is considered to be extremely difficult and this time the havoc of nature made this difficult path difficult
 is dham ke darshan karne ke liye gayi shraddhaluon ko is baar puri yatra main kai chunautiyaan mil rahi hai
 How Kedarnath Temple Built This temple was built thousands of years ago by Pandavas, later Adi Guru Shankaracharya got this temple renovated
 panchkedaaron main pramukh kedarnath mandir main bhagwaan shiv ke dhad rup ke darshan hote hai
 It is said that after the Mahabharata war in Dwapar era, the Pandavas wanted to wash away the sin of murder and for this, they wanted to see Lord Shiva, but Aughdani was angry with the Pandavas and that's why Mahadev took the form of buffalo to avoid the Pandavas
 So his torso was dropped here, which the devotees now call as Kedarnath Dham
 kehete hai bhagwaan kedarnath kaa sir nepal main or unki bhujaaen tungnath main, mukh rudranath main, naabhi madmadeshwar main or jataa kalpeshwar main prakat hui
 Therefore, along with these four places, Shri Kedarnath is called Panchkedar, whose worship gives freedom from all sins and troubles
 bhagwaan kedarnath ke kapaat saal main 6 maheene aam bhakton ke liye khulte hai
 Lord Bhairavnath is worshiped before the kapat opens and then the doors of the Lord are opened
 uske baad bhukund bhairav kii puja hoti he, jinhen kshetrapal mana jaataa he, lekin sardiyon main unka kapaat band ho jaataa he
 During this time Baba Kedar resides in Ukhimath
 iske peeche yah manyata kaam karti he ki chah maheene tak naarad muni bhagwaan kii akele main aradhana karte hai
 As soon as the doors of Lord Kedarnath are opened, there is a longing in the mind of every devotee that during this time one can attain the virtue of many births by seeing God
 yatra kii shuruatkedarnath kii yatra gopeshwar ke gopinath se aarambh hoti he
 There is a temple of Mata Anusuiya, 18 km from Gopeshwar, whose blessings fill the lap of mothers
 mata ke is darbar se hokar bhakt ukhimath pahunchate hai, jahaan shriram ke purvaj raja mandhaata ne kathor tap kiya tha
 Ukhimath is the holy abode where Baba Kedarnath's holy throne resides in winter
 ukhimath se hote hue shraddha kii ye yatra phata pahunchati he
 Devotees reach Kedarnath after traveling 14 km from Fata to Gaurikund

 The article was titled - 'new York City Restaurant's first licensee to serve human flesh
 ''empirenews' website par disclemursection main saaf kiya gaya he ki us par kaalpanik or satyrical (vyangy) story prakashit kii jaati hai
 It says- 'empire News is for entertainment purposes only

 'lekin is tarah kaa disclemur un anya websites main aasaani se uplabdh nahin hua jinhone is viral lekh ko prakashit kiya
 In such a situation, the viral article claiming that New York City is licensed to serve human flesh is far from the real facts

 kya balaatkaar ko lekar hamaare desh kaa kanoon kamjor he? kya balaatkaariyon ko kadi sazaa nahin milti? nirbhaya se lekar ajtak jab bhi balaatkaar kaa koi maamla saamne aata he to hameshaa kamazor kanoon or kam sajaa kii duhai di jaati he
 However, the truth is that in the case of rape, there is a provision of punishment-a-death
 darasal sachai ye he ki kanoon to kade hai magar sazaa dilaane main vakt lag jaataa he
 Take only the culprits of Nirbhaya, even today the hanging noose has not reached their throats
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki ab desh main pehali baar balaatkaariyon ke liye sharia jaise kanoon kii maang uthaai gai he or ye maang kashmir se ai he
 First Kathua then Shimla and Unnao
 
 And now the shameful incident of gang rape with an innocent girl in Bandipora was carried out
 logon kaa gussa sadakon par foot rahaa he
 The opposition is attacking the government
 aise main kai log sharia kanoon kii baat kar rahe hai
 Some say that the poor who perpetrated rape-related incidents should be stoned to death according to Sharia law
 udhar, dilli se nirbhaya kii maa kaa bayaan bhi aata he
 She says "when will Nirbhaya's convicts be hanged
 sirf beti padhaao beti bachaao kehane se kuch nahin hota
 You also have to do something
 " udhar, desh ke pradhanmantri apni siyaasi reliyon main kehete hai ki aise maamalon main doshiyon ko jald se jald faansee di ja rahi he
 The truth is that for the last 15 years no rape accused has been hanged in India
 desh main aakhri baar 2004 main dhananjay chatarji ko 14 saal kii bacchee ke saath balaatkaar karne ke jurm main kolkata main faansee di gai thi
 Although the laws were very much in these 15 years, neither did Nirbhaya's rapist get hanged
 naa unnav main dalit mahila se rape karne vaale netaa ji
 Nor guilty of Kathwa
 ye taadaad bahut lambii he
 So much so that the government stopped releasing rape figures from 2016 onwards
 ab ek baar phir bandipora main 3 saal kii maasoom bacchee ke saath hue balaatkaar ke baad awaz uthne lagi he
 Voice why rapists should not be punished under Sharia law
 9 may 2019 sambal, bandipora, kashmir20 saal ke ek yuvak ne pados main rahane vaali 3 saal kii maasoom bacchee ko toffee kaa laalach dekar pehle to ghar se agava kiya phir sunsaan ilaake main le jaakar use apni havas kaa shikaar banaaya
 After this, leaving him there in a bad condition and went away
 kaaphi der baad dhundne par bacchee nazadik ke kheton main mili
 Who was hospitalized
 gharavaalon ne police ko ittela di
 The police immediately arrested the accused
 magar ghatana kii jaankaree baahar jate hi log aaropee ko haathon-haath sajaa-e-maut dene kii maang karne lage
 Protests erupted, anger erupted all over the valley as soon as the news of political hot-bloods came

 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti sparked a separate debate after the rape
 mahabuuba mufti ne kaha ki rape ke aropiyon se sharia jaise sakht kanoon ke tahat hi nipatna chahie
 So that no goth could dare to do so in the eyes of an innocent person
 in deshon main he sakht kanoofghanistan, iran, iraq, pakistan, saudi arab, sudan or yaman jaise deshon main rape ke aropiyon ko sharia kanoon ke tahat sazaa di jaati he
 Although Sharia law is not fully applicable in India
 muslim personal bharat main zarur he
 In such a situation, the question is, what is the law in Sharia for the accused of rape? What is Shariat Shariat is actually a set of rules of living within Islamic society
 jisase puri duniya main islamic samaaj sanchalit hota he
 Experts believe that the laws used in it are derived from the Quran and Hadith
 sharia islam ke andar saamaajik, dharmik, raajnneetik, aarthik or saanskrithik rup se jeene ke liye kaayadon ko bayaan karata he
 It tells how a Muslim should live among all these aspects
 rape or mahilaon ke saath atyaachaar ko lekar sharia main sakht kanoon he
 For example, whipping publicly
 pathar maarna
 Hanging on a cross sir dhad se alag kar dena
 To cut off the genitalia
 sabhi ke liye samaan kanoonjahan tak bharat kii baat he, bhartiya samvidhan main sabhi dharmon, jatiyon ke logon ko jeene ke samaan adhikari die gaye hai
 But as far as those who believe in Islam are concerned, all matters between Muslims, domestic, family, especially between marriage, divorce, children's affairs and mian-biwi, parents are resolved according to Sharia law
 
 bhartiya kanoon usamen hastkshep nahin karata he
 But just as the incidents of rape in Alwar and now Bandipora, Mehbooba's statement of dealing with such accused under Sharia law has certainly sparked a new debate on this matter

 Slow Internet Speed most users need good speed internet for cashless transactions
 lekin bharat main internet kii sthiti kaaphi nirashajanak he
 In such cases, session time out, payment failure, internet disconnect, network error and OTP timeout are not included in people's routine
 ye choti problem kahi ja sakati hai, lekin yah gambhir hai, kyonki kai baar in vajahon se kaam harj hota he

 When he pointed to the new airport complex and the metro rail line connecting it to the city, he had a proud face
 in donon pariyojnaon ko jameen par utaarne ke liye gadakari ne badi jaddojahad jo kii he
 He informed that the multi-model International Hub Airport at Nagpur, abbreviated as Mihan, is a public sector joint venture, which is a cargo hub for the Special Economic Zone (special Economic Zone) spread over 40 square kilometers near the airport
 By laying the foundation of large-scale industrial development in this city
 ve bataate hai, ''nagpur hawaii adda mumbai or dilli hawaii addon par bheedbhad se raahat dene ke alaava, madhya bharat ko maal vitaran ke liye purvi or dakshin asia se antarrashtriya malwahak udaanon kii laagat main baari kami laaegaa
 "after this, Gadkari turned to the metro rail project, which he started despite many criticisms
 aalochakon kaa kahana tha ki tear-2 (duusare darje) shahar main 9,000 karod rupaya kii baari laagat se metro jaisi lakadak parivahan seva gaiyr-jaruri or paise kii barbaadi he, jiske adhikansh hisse main 20 minute kii drive main pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 Gadkari argues that instead of waiting for Nagpur to become a city jammed with traffic jams and suffering from vehicular pollution, the 43-km-long eco-friendly metro rail project with 42 stations, at the time of commuting for the people of this city with a population of 29 lakh Will make up for the cost
 dur se dikhaai dete oonche plateformon kii ore ishaara karte hue gadakari garv ke saath kehete hai, ''aap un khambhon ko dhyaan se dekhie
 We are assuring that the metro meets two-thirds of its power needs with solar photovoltaic panels mounted on roofs, walls and bridges of the rail network
 "naare lagaate or bhaajapa ke jhande laharaate utsaahi samarthakon ke vishaal hujum ne hawaii adde ke lounj main gadakari kaa swaagat kiya
 He smiled and greeted the people he knows in Marathi and continued to greet everyone with folded hands
 apni car main savaar hone se pehle ve mudate hai or kehete hai, ''2014 kaa pehla chunaav maine nagpur se ladaa or isliye chunaa gaya kyonki rajya main mantri rahete mere kaamkaaj or meri chhavi ko logon ne pasand kiya
 This time people will give a verdict on that, which i have built a magnificent infrastructure to change the appearance of the city and worked for every section of the city

 For all these reasons, Nagpur has finally started to look active in the second capital of Maharashtra, not just in name
 mukhyamantri devendra fadavis or narendra modi sarkaar ke sarvshereshth mantriyon main shumaar gadakari donon isi shahar ke bete hai or donon ne milakar is shahar kaa nakshaa badal diya he
 Due to his efforts, electricity and investment in the state has shifted from western Maharashtra to Vidarbha in recent years
 kandhe se kandhaa milakar kaam karte hue, gadakari or fadavis (jo isi shahar se vidhayak hai) nagpur ko ek bade vyavsaayik centre ke rup main viksit kar rahe hai or wardha tathaa gondia ke padosi jilon ko ek broad-gej metro network ke saath jod rahe hai
 Despite being a Hindutva bench, Nagpur has become a BJP stronghold in recent years
 aazaadee ke baad se yah seat zyaadaatar congress ne hi jiti thi
 The BJP won the 1996 elections here for the first time after Banwarilal Purohit left the Congress and joined the BJP
 haalanki, 1998 main congress ne seat waapas le lee or congress ke vilaas mutemvaar ne ise chaar baar jeeta
 In 2014, Gadkari defeated Muttemwar by winning by a margin of 2,85,000 votes
 narendra modi kii lahar main pehali baar vidarbha kii sabhi 10 loksabhaa siton par bhaajapa ne kabja jamaaya
 In the assembly elections held in the same year, the BJP won 44 of the 62 seats in the region and held a substantial lead over the Congress
 2014 tak, gadakari ne loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha kaa chunaav nahin ladaa tha
 He was 32 years old when he became a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Council in 1989 from the graduate constituency of Nagpur
 is seat se ve kai baar vidhaan parishad pahunche or 1996 or 1999 ke bich rajya ke lok nirmaan mantri ke rup main apane kaarykaal ke dauraan bhi vidhaan parishad ke hi sadsy the
 At the same time, he got the nickname 'roadkari' for constructing high speed roads and flyovers including the state-of-the-art mumbai-pune highway
 kendriya mantri ke rup main is pari main unki chhavi ek kaam karne vaale vyakti kii bani
 As the Minister of Road Transport and Highways, Shipping and Water Resources, he set huge goals for rivers and Ganga development and also met them
 nitin 'roadkari'nagpur ke liye kiye kaaryon ke saath-saath kendriya mantri ke rup main unki uplabdhiyon kii lambii suchi, vishesh rup se sadak nirmaan main, ko dekhte hue mana ja rahaa he ki gadakari aasaani se dobaaraa chunaav jeet jaaenge
 But Gadkari is never willing to underestimate his opponents
 is baar congress ne unke saamne 2014 main padosi bhandara-gondia seat se bhaajapa ke tikat par chunaav jite naanaa patole ko utarkar khel ko pechida banane kii koshish kii he
 Nana Patole left the party in 2017 to protest against the Modi government's apathy towards addressing the problems of farmers
 patole ke maidan main utarane se mutemvaar sahit jile ke sabhi congressi netaaon ne apane aapasi matbhedon ko bhulaakar gadakari ko haraane ke liye qamar kas lee he
 The women's wing at the Congress Party office located in the center of Old Nagpur is gathered to hear Patole's tactics against Gadkari
 yahaan koi airkandishnar nahin he, bas chat se latake pankhe teji se gum rahe hai
 The heat is outside tolerated even though the doors are open
 deevaaron par nehru, shastri or indira gandhi sahit bahut se congress netaaon kii tasviren saji hai
 Patole arrives two hours late and local leaders are giving speeches to keep the crowd at bay
 congress ke paas sanghathanaatmak dakshata or dhan shannti kii kami he jo bhaajapa ke paas he
 The other side finally reached Patole
 ve gadakari ke vikaas ke daavon ke khilaaf aakraamak hamale karte hai
 They roar, "they inaugurated the Nagpur Metro in a hurry, but is it going on?" They built cement roads, but did they not become the cause of severe floods in July last year? Gadkari promised 50,000 jobs a year and now says that he has given only 25,000 jobs
 bhaajapa ne pani kii aapurti kaa kaam ek nijee company ko diya he—aakhir ve kidar lekar ja rahe hai? jaaie or sarkari aspataalon ke durdasha dekh lijie
 Does Gadkari call it development? ”patole turned to face me after this meeting and then repeated the same allegations that he had made in that meeting
 phir ve kehete hai, ''unhone alag vidarbha rajya banane kaa likhit vaada bhi kiya tha
 He had a government at the center and the state
 unhone apana vaada kyon nahin nibhaayaa?"agle din, nagpur ke chaar baar ke saansad mutemvaar ne shankar nagar ke khubasurat bageeche ke saamne apane awaas par mujhe naashte ke liye aamantrit kiya
 When i tasted the idli and pohe at breakfast, Muttemwar said that he withdrew from the election due to back problem
 unka daawa he ki airport parisar sahit sabhi vikaas kaary saansad ke rup main unke prayaason se shuru hue the or congress ke saare kaaryon kaa puraa shrey gadakari le rahe hai
 They believe that they lost the 2014 election from Gadkari not because of any shortage in their work, but because of the bjp's propaganda against the UPA-2 government and the Modi wave
 gadakari apane virodhiyon ke daavon se kuch khiz se jate hai magar kehete hai ki is mudde par ulajhna nahin chaahate
 They only emphasize that the framework of the Mihan project was set when he was a minister in the state

 '' alag vidarbha rajya ke vaade kaa kya hua? jawaab main gadakari kehete hai, ''ham iske liye patibaddh hai or ek din aayega jab hamen alag rajya milegaa
 Gadkari Patole is also upset with the allegation that he has privatized water distribution in the city for personal gain
 ve kehete hai, ''sab kuch paardarshee he
 Can they tell you a single contract for which the tender was not called and any tender that did not go to the lowest bidder? Elections are on the head and they have no agenda to tell, hence making unwarranted and baseless allegations
 "gadakari yah nahin dikhaanaa chaahate hai ki is tarah ke aaropon se ve kitne aahat hote hai
 Looking into my eyes, he says firmly, "I have not been involved with business since 2012

 His reputation has also led to these murmurs that if the bjp's tally falls below 200 in this general election, he could be Modi's possible choice for the post of Prime Minister
 ve aisi baton ko khaarij karte hue kehete hai, ''meri aisi koi mahatvakanksha nahin he
 i do not want to be Prime Minister or Chief Minister
 main party kaa sipaahi hum
 i want to do something for our country and our poor people and for me politics is only a means of social reform
 "maine gadakari kii shuru kii gai metro rail pariyojna kaa jayja lene kaa faisla kiya jise ab nagpur kaa gaurav kaha jaataa he

 We do not think it is a waste of money

 We do not need the generosity of the government
 ham keval chaahate hai ki afjal kaa shav hamen lautaaya jaae
 He also called the receipt of information on Afzal's hanging on behalf of Tihar authorities yesterday as a "cruel joke"

 Kolkata Knight Riders team will once again face them after beating Deccan Chargers at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Sunday
 mangalvaar ko hone vaala yah muqabla niterirds ke 'ghar' eden gardens main khelaa jayega or gautam gambheer kii team lagaataar duusari baar deccan ko dhul chataane ke liye kritasankalp hogi
 This will be the 32nd league match of the fifth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL)
 niterirds ne ab tak saat match khele hai
 He has won in four while he has lost in three
 vah nau tiimon kii talika main tisare sthaan par he
 The Knightriders team has overcome itself by recovering from the initial setbacks
 yahi kaaran he ki vah lig ke madhyantar tak pahunchate-pahunchate tisare sthaan par kabiz ho gai he lekin deccan kaa to ab tak khaataa bhi nahin khulaa he
 Deccan have lost all five matches played so far
 katak main niterirds ne paanch wicket ke antar se jeet hasil kii thi
 After Deccan were held to a modest 126, Knightriders had to wait 19 overs to reach the target
 is lihaaj se uski is jeet ko prabhaavshaalee nahin kaha ja saktaa he
 The Knightriders team will realize this and would like to improve their performance
 jaahir taur par gharelu darshakon ke saamne khelte hue uske haq main maahaul hoga lekin deccan ko yah match jeetne ke liye atirikt shram lagaana hoga
 The comments deccan ke captain kumaar sangakaara kah chuke hai ki kharaab fielding ke kaaran niterirds ke khilaaf unki team ko haar mili lekin iske alaava deccan ke captain ko apane ballebaajon se adhik se adhik ran jutaney ko kahana hoga
 Batting for Deccan, Shikhar Dhawan, Parthiv Patel, Dale Steyn and Ankit Sharma are consistently doing well in bowling but captain Sangakkara, Cameron White, Jean Paul Duminy in batting and Amit Mishra and Veer Pratap Singh are opening their team account
 There is a need to show exceptional shine in bowling
 indian premier lig (ipel) ke paanchaven sanskaran kaa yah 32waan lig match hoga
 Nightriders have played seven matches so far
 chaar main use jeet mili he jabaki teen main haar jhelni padi he
 He is third in the table of nine teams
 niterirds team ne shuruaati jhatkon se ubarte hue khud par kaabo paa liya he
 This is the reason that she has reached the third position by reaching the time of the league, but Deccan has not even opened its account
 deccan ab tak khele gaye sabhi paanch match ganvaa chukaa he
 In Cuttack, Knight Riders won by a five-wicket margin
 deccan ko 126 ran ke saadhaaran score par rokane ke baad niterirds ko lakshya hasil karne ke liye 19 overon tak intjaar karnaa padaa tha
 In this sense, his victory cannot be called impressive
 niterides team ko is baat kaa ahsaas hoga or vah apane pradarshan main sudhaar laana chaahegi
 Obviously playing in front of the home audience will be an atmosphere in his favor, but Deccan will have to put extra labor to win this match
 tippaniyan Deccan captain Kumar Sangakkara has said that his team lost against Knight Riders due to poor fielding, but apart from this, the Deccan captain will have to ask his batsmen to get maximum runs
 deccan ke liye ballebaaji main shikhar dhawan, parthiv patel, gendbaaji main del sten or ankit sharma lagaataar acha pradarshan kar rahe hai lekin captain sangakaara, camran white, jyaan paul dumini ko ballebaaji main tathaa amit mishra or vir pratap singh ko apni team kaa khaataa kholane ke liye gendbaaji main asaadharan chamak dikhaane kii jarurat he

 Meanwhile, Aaj Tak's team has tried to find CCTV footage around the scene
 gomtinagar ilaake se ek aisi footage mili he, jisamen vivek tiwari kii car guzarate hue najar aa rahi he
 The incident occurred late Friday (28–29 September)
 sisitivi footage main raat 1 bajkar 19 minute par yah car road se guzarati hui najar aa rahi he or iske turant baad hi vivek par goli chalaa di gai
 However, how much CCTV footage will help the investigation is difficult to say
 lekin jahaan se yah sisitivi footage liya gaya he or jis jagah pillar se vivek kii car takaraai he, uske bich kii duuri kareeb 250 meter he
 There are also several government and private buildings in the middle of this distance, where CCTV footage can provide important clues in the investigation
 ghatnasthal ke kareeb sisitivihalanki, esaiti sutron ne abhi spasht nahin kiya he ki kya aise koi duusari sisitivi uplabdh he yaa nahin
 But there is a distance of only 20 meters between a building located here and the scene of the incident (where the shot was fired)
 is building ke entry get par hi sisitivi camera laga he or doosraa camera building ke andar he
 It is expected that the camera installed outside this building can reveal the movement of Vivek's car
 saath hi is baat kaa bhi khulaasa ho saktaa he ki kya vivek ne apni car se pulisavaalon kii bike ko kuchalane kii koshish kii or vahaan se bhaagane kii koshish kii
 Aaj Tak has also talked to the guard of this building on this issue
 lekin us raat vahaan duty par na hone ke kaaran vah kuch bataane main asamarth hai
 However, the guard definitely told that the investigation team has reached here to take CCTV footage, but the office is closed due to Sunday
 philhal, esaiti har mumkin pahalu se is maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Today, once again, the investigation team can scan CCTV footage present around the scene, which can prove helpful in getting to the bottom of this case

 The BJP wants to make it a counter to the leadership, but the Congress does not want that

 The popularity of a leader does not translate into victory of seats for the party

 Yadav says- 'there is no way for the BJP to cross 200 seats or touch this figure, if the three' i 'i

 CBI, RBI and CJI take a more drastic turn then the situation can get worse for BJP
 jahaan tak congress kaa sawaal he to wo koi ummid yaa utsaah jagaane main naakaam he

 We are raising the right issue

 When Chinese President Xi Jinping reached Ahmedabad on Wednesday, a new text was written about the india-china relationship
 do ghanton ke bheetar donon deshon ke bich teen bade samjhaute hue or phir pradhanmantri samet shi kaa kafila gandhi ashram hote hue sabarmati riverfrant tak pahunchaa
 But amidst all this there was also a flag meeting between China and the Indian Army on the outskirts
 darasal, yah padosi mulk kii do tasviren hai or in tasveeron ke bich agar kuch sab se alag or nayaa he, to usamen 'china kii pratham mahila' ping liyuan bhi hai
 The discussion of Ping Liyuan is also important here because the presence of a President's wife in the social scene in this way is different and new in Chinese history
 darasal, yah pehla mauka nahin he jab america kii tarj par 'china kii pratham mahila' kahi jane vaali ping liyuan apane pati or china ke rashtradhyaksh ke saath kisi raashtra ke daure par hon
 She has previously been to South Africa during the Russia and BRICS summits
 bharat daure ko lekar ping kaa utsaah pehle hi jagajaahir ho chukaa he
 Ping Liyuan, who has been more famous than Xi Jinping, is playing the role that the wife of former heads of state has so far avoided
 lekin duniya china ke raashtrapati kii patni kii is nai bhoomika ko chini kootneeti kaa nayaa cheharaa maan rahi he
 On the other hand, talking about Ping Liyuan, until a few years ago, she has lived more than her husband Xi Jinping
 51 saal kii ping china kii jaani-maani or sabase mashhoor loakgeet gayikaon main ek hai
 But Ping did not consider it appropriate to pursue her career when her husband became president in 2012
 ping kii charchaa sirf videshon main nahin he
 His presence in social gatherings and events is the most read and watched news in China
 china kii media ke liye ping kii routine life or unke kapadon ko chini raashtrapati ke aadhikarik kaaryakramon se kahin adhik dekha or padhaa jaataa he
 Wherever Ping goes, his own schedule is set apart from the President's programs
 bharat daure par bhi vah nai dilli main ek skool main bacchon se mulaakaat karne vaali he
 She will participate in the school's cultural program and will teach caligraphy to children
 yphone, ping liyuan or chini mediaping se itar purv raashtrapati maao jedong kii patni jiyang quing bhi isse pehle saamaajik kaaryakramon main shirkat karti najar ai hai, lekin shi se pehle raashtrapati pad par asin hu jintao bhi is ore asahaj dikhe
 Speaking to India Today Group, a Chinese official said, 'madam Ping Liyuan may be very curious about India's history
 vah bharat ke itihaas, samskruti ke bare main zyada se zyada jaananaa chahengi
 'ping is also very sensitive about his public profile
 ek dfa unhen outing ke dauraan appal kaa yphone istemaal karte dekha gaya tha
 His photograph was also taken by a photographer
 sthaneey media main isaki aalochana bhi hui thi ki vah ek america company kaa phone istemaal karti hai
 It is said that a few days later, Ping Liyuan was seen with the mobile of China's telecom company ZTE

 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has started working towards smaller parties in Uttar Pradesh instead of SP-BSP
 is kadi main unhone pehle mahaan dal ke apane saath milaane ke baad ab unki najar sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke chachaa shivpal yadav kii pragatisheel samaajawaadee party par najar he
 There was speculation about this when Congress MLC and Mane Deepak Singh, close to Priyanka Gandhi, met Shivpal Yadav and after the picture of the two leaders came out, political matters are being removed
 charchaa to is baat kii bhi siyaasi galiyaaron main tej he ki priyanka gandhi or shivpal yadav ke bich is masale par phone par baatcheet hui he
 But neither Shivpal Yadav has confirmed this nor has anyone been able to do it from the Congress camp
 lekin deepak singh kii photo shivpal ke saath aane ke baad ye saaf ho gaya he ki donon dalon ke bich kuch khichdi pak rahi he
 In the political corridors, phone conversations between Priyanka and Shivpal Yadav are being speculated
 haalanki yah sach he ki congress netaa pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke netaaon ke saath sampark main hai or shivpal yadav bhi congress se gathbandhan kii ichha jataa chuke hai
 Congress leader PL Punia and Shivpal Yadav are in touch with each other
 gathbandhan ko lekar jyotiraditya sindhiya lagaataar apni baithkon main congress netaaon se raay jaan rahe hai
 They are also asking questions about whether to combine or not
 congress mahasachiv or purvi upi main party kaa prabhaar dekh raheen priyanka gandhi bhi netaaon se gathbandhan ko lekar mashvira kar rahi hai
 Let me tell you that there was again an alliance between the Congress and the great party in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday
 mahaan dal ke adhyaksh keshav dev maury ne lakhanu main priyanka gandhi or jyotiraditya sindhiya se mulaakaat kii
 During this time he offered an alliance to the Congress, which was accepted
 priyanka ne kaha, 'vah maury kaa swaagat karti hai or ham aglaa loksabhaa chunaav milakar ladenge
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has given us the goal to create a politics in which everyone is represented
 yah gathbandhan usee disha main kiya gaya prayaas he
 We will fight the battle of 2019 with life vahiin, mahaan dal ke adhyaksh maury ne is maukey par kaha ki sirf congress ne hi daliton or pichhadon ke aarakshan samet tamaam hiton ke bare main sochaa or kaam kiya he
 Only this party thinks of taking everyone along
 2009 or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mahaan dal kaa congress se gathbandhan rahaa he
 The Mahan Dal contested Badaun, Nagina and Etah seats in alliance with Congress in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but faced defeat here
 baharhaal ab dekhnaa he ki mahaan party ke saath gathbandhan ke baad aglaa number congress ke saath gathbandhan main kis kshetreey dal kaa aata he
 In Idaho, a woman climbed 22 feet up on the board for a swim, but as soon as she started jumping, she panicked and stumbled and fell down from the top

 You will also laugh after watching the video

 According to Mail Online, the woman has also suffered some injuries, but is now well

 The political suspense of the last 15 days is going to end today
 rashtriya rajdhani dilli ko aam aadmi party (aap) kii sarkaar milane vaali he
 It is almost decided that AAP will form the government in Delhi
 arvind kejariwal aaj uparajyapal se milakar sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karne vaale hai
 Kejriwal's opinion is that in the public opinion gathered through open meetings, SMS or other means, 80 per cent people have the mandate that the Aam Aadmi Party should become the new ruler of Delhi
 dilli kii 70 vidhansabha siton main se aam aadmi party ko bahumat se 8 siten kam yani 28 siten hi mili he
 But Bhanwarjal of politics prepared such a dictate that yes, no, yes, no, by the time the matter reached the AAP government in Delhi
 25 yaa 26 disambar ko shapath le sakate he 'aap' ke siemaaj hi arvind kejariwal dilli ke uparajyapal se milenge or sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karenge
 If sources are to be believed, on 25 or 26 December, the Chief Minister of the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi can take oath
 daawa ye bhi he ki dilli main aap kii sarkaar banane ke 15 dinon ke bheetar dilli vidhansabha kaa special seshan bulaayaa jayega
 And the Aam Aadmi Party will try to pass its biggest election promise, the Jan Lokpal bill
 15 dinon ke suspence or janamat sangrah ke siyaasi drame ke baad dilli main wo party sarkaar banane kii dahalij par he, jisaki umr mahaj 1 saal, jisane pehali baar chunaav ladaa, jisane dashakon se siyasat karne vaali desh kii sabase badi partiyon ko maat di
 Who will become AAP government in CM Delhi but who will be the chief minister, how will the cabinet be? The biggest question is that after the change in power, will the appearance of politics also change Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party? Hindustan's eye is restless not only to know when the suspense of forming a government in Delhi will end, but to know this There is also a restless idea about the structure, form and color of the new government of Delhi
 raajnneeti ke nausikhiye mantri banenge to wo kya or kaise karishma karenge? vipaksh main baithne ja rahe dhurandhar vidhayakon se raajnneeti kaa kahkahara bhi na sikh paae aap ke vidhayak kaise nibatenge?kejariwal badalenge dilli kii siyasat kaa chehar xxrep 4 a m aadmi party ne pehle hi elaan kar diya he unki sarkaar main viipi culture nahin chalegaa
 For example, neither the minister of your AAP nor the red light will take the car, nor the official bungalow of AAP will be away from the frills of heavy security, from CM to Minister and MLA, all will be new advocates of simplicity in politics
 masalan pehali hi jang main dilli kaa maidan maarane vaale kejariwal dilli kii siyasat kaa cheharaa badalenge to sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kaa tarika bhi
 Now the public has tried Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party as the pawn of change in politics and expressed confidence in this pawn, so why did Kejriwal and the team also back off
 to taiyaar ho jaaen raajnneeti ke nae nae rang dekhne ke liye
 To see the new face of change
 kya janata kii ummiido par khare utrenge kejarivaljitna bharosa dilli ne aap par jataayaa he, aap ko bhi usee tarah ummiido par khara utarana hoga
 How will Arvind Kejriwal fulfill big claims like cheap electricity, free water, Jan Lokpal bill in 15 days? Arvind Kejriwal has shown to the public as many vegetables, if AAP government is formed in Delhi, then those promises will also have to be fulfilled
 aaj kii taarikh main sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki kya dilli kii ummiido par khara utar paaenge kejariwal
 Will Kejriwal's big promises remain the same as other parties? This mistrust is because Kejriwal has also made promises to win the electoral game, which will bring down the stars from the sky - how will your government fulfill the promise of reducing the electricity bill by 50 percent within 4 months? - 700 to every family in Delhi every day How will the promise of giving free liter water be fulfilled? Informed people say that in fulfilling the biggest election promise to pass the Jan Lokpal bill in 15 days, the Aam Aadmi Party's sweat should be left Gay
 or agar tamaam mashkkat ke baad kejariwal janalokapal bill paas karne main kaamyaab bhi rahe to uski vaidhata sawaalon ke ghere main hogi
 It seems that on the basis of the promises on which Kejriwal won the election, the truth is that Kejriwal is going to be surrounded badly by the same promises
 dilli main aap kii sarkaar ban bhi gai to wo kaanton kaa hi taj sabit hogi

 The petitioner alleges that the government has failed to implement the Uniform Civil Code
 anuchhed 44 kaa uddeshy samaan naagarik samhita lagu karana he, jo bhaichara, ekta or rashtriya ekikaran ke liye jaruri he
 The Aam Aadmi Party is increasing rather than stopping the chaos
 ab khemebaaji bhi tej ho gai he
 Both camps opened up
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ke ghar ahm baithak ho rahi he
 a new strategy is being discussed in this meeting
 AAP main loktantr nahin- ajit jhaanaaf kii NE se nikaale jane par ajit jha ne kaha ki rashtriya parishad main jo ghatana hui he uske baad ham ye kehane kii sthiti main nahin hai ki party main loktantr he
 Our leadership is not in favor of internal democracy

 He has control over the party
 shanivaar ko meeting bulaane, sanchaalan karne, gaiyr sadasyon ko andar bharne kaa faisla arvind kaa tha
 On the other hand, former AAP MLA Rajesh Garg has written a letter to the Lokpal Admiral Ramdas of the party and demanded to take cognizance of the NC meeting
 'aap' main aage kya hoga ?shanivaar ko jis tarah rashtriya parishad kii baithak main jamkar hangaamaa dekhne ko mila
 Out of 300, 247 members who came to participate in the meeting, proposed to oust Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan from the National Executive and were also passed immediately
 inke alaava professor anand kumaar or ajit jha ko bhi rashtriya kaaryakarini se nishkasit kar diya gaya
 After this, this is the only question in everyone's mind that what will be done by the ousted AAP leaders Yogendra Yadav, Prashant Bhushan, Anand Kumar and Ajit Jha
 baagiyon kii agali ranneeti kya hogi
 However, just after being removed from the National Executive, Yogendra Yadav accused the Aam Aadmi Party of being a democrat, for killing democracy
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya isi tarah aam aadmi party ke ye varisht netaa party kii karypranali par sawaal khadey karte rahenge
 Will continue to highlight the flaws present in the party
 vaise rashtriya parishad kii baithak ke baad baagi netaaon ne alag se ek baithak kii
 In such a situation, the question arises that there is no preparation to form a separate party
 kyonki jis tarah prashanth bhushan yogendra yadav kii lokapriyata kii charchaa kar rahe hai wo isi taraf ishaara karata he
 However, removed Professor Anand Kumar is currently in the party and is also talking about improving the party
 lekin aam aadmi party ke in baagi netaaon ke tanj ko dekhakar philhal ye mumkin nahin lagata ki ye aage bhi aam aadmi party main bane rahanaa chaahate hai
 If this was the case, then there is no talk of going to court against the decision of the party
 vaise party kaa rukh baagi netaaon ko lekar naram nahin dikhataa
 a party meeting was held late Saturday night at the home of convenor Arvind Kejriwal, which ran from campaigning on the land acquisition bill to focusing on the work of the Delhi government
 chaar cameti banane par bhi charchaa hui
 But rebel leaders were told to do whatever they want to do
 aise main saaf he ki philhal aam aadmi party neshnal ekjicutive se baagi netaayon ko hataakar maamla shant karne kii koshish kii ho, lekin yogendra yadav,prashanth bhushan,ajit jha or professor anand kumaar kii agali ranneeti kya hogi isapar party kii bhi najar hogi
 It was further written in the letter that our young colleagues associated with civil services also seem to have failed to fulfill their responsibilities
 is patr main pradhanmantri se kaha gaya he ki wo kathua or unnav main peedit pariwaron se maafi maangen or maamalon kii fast trek jaanch karavaaen
 The letter also demanded that the Prime Minister remove the people associated with hate speeches and crimes from his government and call an all-party meeting on this whole issue

 At the same time, some people wrote that they should read the comments of others in the comments section to see the packet of popcorn
 ek yujar ne likhaa, ''mujhe pehle bahut bura laga lekin baad main main jor se hans padi''
 Another wrote, "I thought how thin this girl is and her boots are coming out of her legs

 By the way, by making the correct savings announcements, any person can save income tax, and can also plan their expenses for the year in a better way
 
 
 isi tarah kii ek ghoshnaa ve log karte hai, jo kiraaye ke makaan main rahete hai, or jinhen tankhwaah (vetan yaa selary) main makaan kiraaya bhatta (house rent alouns yaa echaare) mila karata he
 
 
 The house rent allowance usually literally saves the occupants considerable savings in income tax, so it is very important to declare it correctly, but most of the employed people do not understand how it can be achieved
 
 
 so aaie, aaj ham aapako bataate hai - One has to first understand who are entitled to income tax exemption on house rent allowance
 
 
 iske liye sabase zaruri baat yah he ki aapako tankhwaah main makaan kiraaya bhatta miltaa ho, or jis makaan kaa kiraaya aap adaa karne kaa daawa kar rahe hai, vah aap hi ke naam nahin honi chahie
 
 
 In fact, under section 10 (13A) of the Income Tax Act, any salaried person has to deduct 50 per cent of his basic salary, the amount received under the head of HRA or 10 per cent of the basic salary from the actual rent paid in the remaining three sums
 The lowest amount is exempt from income tax
 
 
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi kisi vyakti ko 25,000 rupee mul vetan ke rup main praapt hote hai, or 12,500 rupee echaare ke mad main, or vah 12,500 rupee hi vastav main kiraaya detaa he, to use 10,000 rupee par hi chhot mil paaegi
 
 
 In fact, this amount is saved by deducting 10 per cent (2,500) of the basic salary from the paid rent (12,500)
 
 
 tippaniyan Let us see another example
 
 
 ek or yaad rakhane laayak baat yah he ki agar aap salanaa 1,00,000 rupee (yani 8,333 rupee pratimah) se zyaada kiraaya de rahe hai, to makaan-maalik (bhale hi ve maa yaa pita yaa patni hon) kaa pan number darj kiya janaa bhi anivaary he, or unhen is aamadani par tex dena hoga
 
 
 So remember, to get income tax exemption on house rent allowance, it is necessary that the house renter's property is not there, and payment receipts are present
 
 
 isi tarah kii ek ghoshnaa ve log karte hai, jo kiraaye ke makaan main rahete hai, or jinhen tankhwaah (vetan yaa selary) main makaan kiraaya bhatta (house rent alouns yaa echaare) mila karata he
 
 
 The house rent allowance usually literally saves the occupants considerable savings in income tax, so it is very important to declare it correctly, but most of the employed people do not understand how it can be achieved

 ek or yaad rakhane laayak baat yah he ki agar aap salanaa 1,00,000 rupee (yani 8,333 rupee pratimah) se zyaada kiraaya de rahe hai, to makaan-maalik (bhale hi ve maa yaa pita yaa patni hon) kaa pan number darj kiya janaa bhi anivaary he, or unhen is aamadani par tex dena hoga
 
 
 So remember, to get income tax exemption on house rent allowance, it is necessary that the house renter's property is not there, and payment receipts are present
 
 
 sabase pehle yah samajhnaa hoga ki makaan kiraaya bhatte par inakam tex chhot paane ke hakdaar koun log hai
 
 
 The most important thing for this is that you get house rent allowance in salary, and the house you are claiming to pay rent should not be in your name
 
 
 darasal, inakam tex act ke section 10 (13 e) ke tahat kisi bhi vetanbhogi ko uske mul vetan kaa 50 fisadi, echaare ke mad main milane vaali rakam yaa chukaaye gaye vaastavik kiraaye main se mul vetan kaa 10 fisadi ghataane par bachi teen rakamon main se sabase kam rakam par iskar se chhot milti he
 
 
 For example, if a person receives Rs 25,000 as basic salary, and Rs 12,500 as HRA item, and he actually pays only Rs 12,500, then he will get a rebate of Rs 10,000 only
 
 
 darasal, chukaaye gaye kiraaye kii rakam (12,500) main se mul vetan kaa 10 fisadi (2,500) ghataane par yahi rakam bachati he
 
 
 The comments ek or udhaaharan dekhte hai
 
 
 Another thing to remember is that if you are paying more than Rs 1,00,000 per year (ie Rs 8,333 per month), then the PAN number of the landlord (irrespective of the mother or father or wife) is to be entered
 Also mandatory, and they have to pay tax on this income
 
 
 so, yaad rahe, makaan kiraaya bhatte par iskar chhot paane ke liye zaruri he ki ghar kiraaya dene vaale kii sampatti na ho, or bhugtan kii raseeden maujuud hon
