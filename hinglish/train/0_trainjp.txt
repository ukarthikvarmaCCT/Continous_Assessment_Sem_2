 There will be an increase of Rs 49 per liter

 8 lakh gaanvon main youth club rakhane kaa daawa karne vaale nehru yuva centre kaa haal yah he ki yahaan kaa sheersh netritv ek-duusare ko budtameez or beyimaan bataane main laga he
 The vice presidents of the organization feel that the dictatorial attitude of their director general will overwhelm the organization
 yahaan ke adhikari or karmchaariyon kii association mahanideshak ke virodh main do baar kaali pattee baandhakar pradarshan kar chuki he
 The association has accused the Director General of financial irregularities and changing the minutes of the meeting chaired by the Prime Minister
 mahanideshak par lage aaropon kii jaanch maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii ek vishesh audit team kar rahi he
 At the same time, the Director General is saying that NYKS had become the base of Cahillas and now they want to bring work culture here

 It is a matter of years that this whole civil war is going on in the office of the Scope Tower in East Delhi, which has been burned in the fierce fire in July last year

 The Nehru Yuva Kendra was established in 1972 under Indira Gandhi to connect village youth with nation building
 jab rajeev gandhi pradhanmantri bane to 1987-88 main iskaa naam badalakar nehru yuva centre sanghathan (enavikees) rakh diya gaya

 73 lakh youth club or mahila mandal ke jariye desh bhar main failaate hai
 But this message spread when all is well at home
 ek taraf major general dilawar singh hai, jo sanghathan ko faujee anushaasan ke saath chalaanaa chaahate hai, to duusari taraf upaadhyaksh gana hai jo chaahate hai ki sanghathan na sirf aresas ke taur-tareekon se chale balki is tarah kaam kare ki yah vishaal network bijepi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj ko gaanv-gaanv tak le jaae
 On the third side, there are more than 1,000 officers and employees of the organization, who want the government work to go on, and they should not be imposed on alleged military whims in the name of discipline
 upaadhyaksh or adhikari kehete hai ki major general khud ko pradhanmantri kaa kareebi bataakar board of governors kii puri tarah andekhi kar rahe hai
 Officials flocked to the allegations on the Director General The All India NYKS Officers Welfare Association wrote a letter to the Secretary of Sports and Youth Affairs on 20 March this year, making detailed allegations against the Director General

 The minutes of this meeting were made available to the Director General on 28 April 2016
 lekin mahanideshak ne in minutes main chhedchhad kar nae minutes banaakar enavikees ke board of governors (bioji) ke saamne pesh kar die
 The association claims that when this matter came to the notice of the Sports Secretary, he asked the Director General to issue the actual minutes by withdrawing the minutes he had made through letter dated 1-12 / 2016-NYKS dated May 26, 2016
 aakhirkaar, mahanideshak ko minutes waapas lene pade
 The association accused the director general of indecency
 yah maamla usee yuva mahotsav se judaa he, jahaan pradhanmantri yuvaaon ko teen 'si' kii sikh de rahe the
 The association says that the Director General gave a very disappointing speech at the Rohtak program
 jab enavikees ke kaaryakari nideshak ne unhen tokaa to mahanideshak ne khuleam gaali-galouj kii
 Many officers of the organization have complained of abusive language against the Director General

 Association president Prakash Vaidya told India Today, "the Director General's behavior is completely anti-employee and full of dictatorship
" ''upaadhyaksh ne kaha, mahanideshak ko pad se hataoarees prishthbhumi se telugana ke varisht bhaajapa netaa or enavikees ke upaadhyaksh raav ne pichley saal 18 november ko pradhanmantri narendra modi ko lanbaa patr likhakar enavikees ke kaamkaaj main gambhir khamiyaan ginaayin

 (he also showed a whatsapp chat with Rao) and when i said to complain about it, he himself wrote a letter to the Prime Minister in my complaint

 Nurses are praised as 'angels on earth', but their professional lives in India are relatively pathetic, especially in the private health sector
 unhen kam vetan miltaa he or kharaab sthiti main kaam karnaa padataa he
 This was revealed in a study conducted in Kerala about nurses working in New Delhi
 adhyayan ke mutabik behatar pagaar or behatar kaary sthiti kii maang ko lekar haal main desh ke vibhinn nijee aspataalon main hui nurson kii hadtaal evam andolanon se unki sthiti main koi khaas badlaav nahin aayaa he
 Sreelekha Nair, Junior Fellow of the Center for Women's Development Studies, New Delhi, who studies, said that verbal and physical harassment remain a major problem for nurses
 unhen na sirf doctoron or prabandhan, balki sahakarmiyon ke durvyavhaar kaa bhi saamana karnaa padataa he
 Indian Nursing Council member PK Thampi said that hospital management exploits nurses
 nurson or prabandhan ke bich lagbhag gulam evam maalik jaise rishte hote hai
 Referring to the low salaries paid to nurses in the private sector, he said that most of them did their education by taking an educational loan of four to six lakh rupees
 unke dwaara chukaai jane vaali nunatam kisht kareeb chah hajaar se 10 hajaar rupee hogi, jabaki unhen tankhwaah ke rup main 2,500 se lekar 6,500 rupee tak hi mil pate hai
 Thampi said, despite the poor situation in the area, most of them stick to the job, as they have no other option
 'mowing vid da times-gender, states and migration of norses in india' prakashit karne vaali shrilekha ne kaha, nurson ko keval unke varisht hi nahin, balki marijon ke sambandhi bhi maukhik rup se pratadit karte hai, jaisaa ki akhabaaron main chhapata he, kuch maamalon main unka shaareerik shoshan bhi kiya jaataa he
 The comments adhyayan main kaha gaya he ki marijon kii jaan bachaane ke maamle main nurson ke yogadan kii bahut si kahaniyaan hai, lekin unke yogadan par dhyaan nahin diya jaataa
 It is true that doctors participating in important health-related tasks have names everywhere, but the names of nurses are never mentioned in the record, for example tasks such as the first cardiac operation
 iske anusaar nurson ke shoshan kaa ek or tarika yah he ki aspataal prabandhan nurson ke pramaan patron ko 'jabt' kar lete hai, jisase ve bharat yaa videsh main achche avasar hasil nahin kar paatin
 According to the study, other types of frauds are done to nurses in private hospitals
 unka vetan kaagajon main kuch or darshaya jaataa he, jabaki hakeekat main unhen isse kam paise die jate hai
 According to the study, there has not been any significant change in the situation due to the strike and movements of nurses in various private hospitals of the country recently in order to demand better wages and better working conditions
 adhyayan karne vaale nai dilli sthit 'centre for women deveopment studies' kii junior phelo shrilekha nair ne kaha ki nurson ke saamne maukhik evam shaareerik utpeedan ek badi samasya bana hua he
 They face abuse not only of doctors and management, but also of colleagues
 indian nursing council ke sadsy pike thampi ne kaha ki aspataal prabandhan nurson kaa shoshan karata he
 The relationship between nurses and management is almost slave and owner
 nijee kshetra main nurson ko milane vaale kam vetan kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki unamem se adhiktar ne chaar se chah lakh rupee kaa shaikshik rin lekar apni padhai kii hoti he
 The minimum installment they pay will be around six thousand to 10 thousand rupees, while they get only Rs 2,500 to 6,500 rupees as salary
 thampi ne kaha, kshetra main kharaab sthiti hone ke baavjood unamem se adhiktar naukari se chipki rahati hai, kyonki unke paas koi anya vikalp nahin hota
 Sreelekha, who publishes' Moving with the times-gender, Status and Migration of Nurses in India, said, nurses are verbally tortured not only by their superiors, but also by patients, as it appears in newspapers
 In some cases they are also physically abused
 tippaniyan The study said that there are many stories of nurses 'contribution in saving patients' lives, but their contributions are ignored
 yah sach he ki mahatvapurn swasthya sambandhi kaaryon main bhaag lene vaale doctoron kaa har jagah naam hota he, lekin nurson ke naam kaa record main kabhi koi ullekh nahin hota, udhaaharan ke liye hriday ke pratham oparation jaise kaary
 According to this, another method of exploitation of nurses is that hospital management 'confiscate' the nurses' certificates, which prevent them from getting good opportunities in India or abroad
 adhyayan ke anusaar nijee aspataalon main nurson ke saath anya tarah kii dhokhadhadi bhi kii jaati he
 His salary is shown more on paper, while in reality he is paid less

 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne buudhvaar ko china ke videsh mantri wang yi ke saath mulaakaat kii
 In this meeting, raising the issue of terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district, Sushma Swaraj said that this was a direct result of the exemption given by Pakistan to jaish-e-mohammad and its leaders
 bharat ne ek din pehle hi pakistan main jaish-e-mohammad ke ek pramukh aatankwaadi shivi ko tabah kiya tha
 Pakistan's close ally, China Jaish chief Masood Azhar, has repeatedly failed India's efforts to declare it a global terrorist
 wang yi ke saath sushamaa kii yah mulaakaat ahm maani ja rahi he
 Jaish is already listed on the UN banned terrorist organizations list
 bharat 2009 me hi ajahar masood ko sanyukt raashtra main vaishvik aatankwaadi qaraar dene kaa prastaav pesh kar chukaa he
 India then moved a proposal for the second time to the un's 1267 sanctions committee in 2016 along with P3 - America, Britain and France - to ban Azhar
 ajahar masood janvari 2016 ke pathankot vaayu thikaane par hamalaa kaa bhi aaropee he
 Subsequently, in 2017 P3 countries introduced a similar proposal
 baharhaal, har baar china ne ajahar par bharat ke prastaav ko block kar diya
 During the meeting of Foreign Ministers of russia-india-china, Swaraj said, "I have come to China at a time when there is an atmosphere of grief and anger in India
" yah jammu-kashmir main hamaare suraksha balon ke khilaaf sabase bheeshan hamalaa tha
 He said, this attack has been carried out by Pakistan-based terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed
 gauratlab he ki 14 farvari ko aatankwaadi sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad ne pulavama main siarpief ke kafile par aatanki hamalaa kiya tha jisamen 40 jawan shahid ho gaye
 In the aftermath of this incident, on Tuesday, India took major action and destroyed the largest training camp of jaish-e-mohammad in Balakot, about 80 km from the Line of Control, in which a large number of terrorists, trainers and top commanders were killed
 swaraj ne rekhaankit kiya ki jaish-e-mohammad sanyukt raashtra or anya deshon dwaara pratibandhit sanghathan he
 He told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang that this terrorist attack was a direct result of the exemption from Pakistan to jaish-e-mohammed and its leaders
 unhone kaha, pulavama hamale ke baad puure sanyukt raashtra ne ek swar main isaki ninda kii
 During a meeting with Wang Yi in Wuzhen, China on Tuesday morning, he said that this is his first meeting in 2019 and as such it is the right time for both sides to review bilateral relations and pursue cooperation
 swaraj ne vuhaan main pradhanmantri narendra modi or china ke raashtrapati shi jinping kii vaarta kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki hamane sambandhon main thos pragati kii he
 He also told Wang that it is necessary for both parties to ensure effective compliance with the guidelines set by the two leaders
 donon netaaon ne prayaas kiye or hamen unhen jari rakhana chahie
 Referring to the bilateral meeting between Modi and Xi in Wuhan last year in his statement, Wang said that the relationship between the two countries has now reached a new dimension
 unhone kaha, hamaare dwipaksheeya sambandhon ke sabhi pahalu thik se chal rahe he
 Both nations and the international community are more hopeful about our bilateral relations
 2019 main ham donon netaaon ke bich bani aam sahmati par kaam karnaa jari rakhenge
 According to the news two days ago, according to the Bombay Stock Exchange, there are about five such stocks whose prices have increased by 10 thousand to 91 thousand percent since December 2006
 yah ek vishleshan se pataa chalaa he
 Of these, the company whose stock has risen, its price is just 1, 10 years ago
 30 rupee thi jo 90,677 fisadi chadh kar is maheene kii paanch taarikh ko 1180 rupee par pahunch gai
 That is, if someone had put only 10 thousand rupees in that stock, then today its price would be around 90
 77 lakh rupee kii hoti
 What is this stock market? Today the young section of the country is very familiar with the stock market
 aam bhashaa main share market wo jagah he jahaan desh kii kai badi companiyaan listed hai or vahaan stock or bond kharide or beche jate hai
 Companies sell stocks with the aim of raising money from the market for new products, improving the quality of existing products, restoring new employees, modernizing their buildings, and better research into building things
 sensex or nifti donon suchakank hai
 SENSEX is also known as BSE
 yah 30 badi or aarthik rup se samrudh companiyon kaa suchakank he
 Similarly, the Nifty is an index of 50 major companies
 25 saal main 10 hajaar bane do karod rupehaalanki yah bazaar jokhim bharaa he lekin pichley 10 saalon main ek forma company ke stock 19,057 fisadi bad gaye to foods company ke stock jo 2007 main mahaj 25 rupee the ab 1600 rupee ke ho gaye
 That is, those who invested one lakh in that company would have withdrawn Rs 64 lakh today
 isi tarah 1991 main jis madras rabad factory ke stock kii keemat mahaj 25 rupee thi wo 25 saalon main 51,269 yani 2050 guna bad gaya
 If then someone had invested only 10 thousand rupees in this company, it would have changed to Rs 2 crore 5 lakh today
 paanch saal main 25 guna phaaydakuch or bhi research hai
 Five years ago, if you had invested one lakh rupees in Indo count, then today after demonetisation, you would have got 25 lakh rupees despite the falling market
 notebandi se pehle itane hi paison kii keemat 80 lakh rupee thi
 If on 3 February 2012, the same amount (rs 1 lakh) was invested in Avanti Feeds, then on 9 October 2015 it would have been 34 lakhs whereas in 8 miles it would have been Rs 62 lakhs
 isi prakaar disambar 2008 main bajaj finance main lagaaya gaya ek lakh rupaya bhi aaj 20 lakh rupee main badal gaya he
 Investment of one thousand rupees, today 2 lakh rupees, on 3 April 1979, Sensex was invested five lakh rupees on 10 April 2016
 19 karod rupee ho gaya
 a 200 per cent increase in 37 years is also a factual and factual historical figure
 kuch export kehete hai ki ek elgorithm ko apanaakar share market se har maheene 60-70 hajaar rupee kamaaye ja sakate hai lekin iske liye kareeb 20-25 lakh rupee lagane honge
 So some say that the subject of high risk to the stock market means that this market is very risky
 ham bhi yahi kahenge ki uparokt bataae gaye sabhi maanakon or gadhe gaye pratimaanon ke baavjood share market main vyapaar yaa nivesh tabhi karen jab aap jokhim se khelnaa chaahate hai anyathaa nahin

 pakistani akhbaar don kii khabar ke mutabik, neshnal students federation (enesuef) ne shuukravaar ko raksha dal ke gathan kaa aayojan kiya

 Every director and actor wants to save big dates for his film and in such a situation it becomes common for two films to collide at the box office

 This week Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao starrer film Judmental Hai Kya has a clash with Diljit Dosanjh and Kriti Sanon starrer film Arjun Patiala
 filmein ek-duusare se behad alag hai or donon kaa janata se alag-alag rispance mil rahaa he
 In such a situation, the question is whether Diljit and Kriti's film Kangana's Judicial Hai Kya will be able to survive? Both Judicial Hai Kya and Arjun Patiala are expected to do well at the box office
 haalanki is baat main koi shaq nahin he ki kangana kii film ke aage nikalne ke chance zyada hai
 The reason is judgmental, there are so many positive reviews
 iske alaava apane posters se lekar trailor tak film jajmental he kya ne darshakon ke dilon main dilchaspee badhaai he
 Apart from this, the audience of the film and its actors has also remained on the film
 film main kangana ranut or rajkumaar raav kaa kaam bhi behad pasand kiya gaya he or inhen saraahaa bhi ja rahaa he
 According to which this judgmental is being discussed
 aise main ise acha verde of mouth milane kii bhi ummid he, jiskaa phayda is film kii kamai main hoga
 Talking about Arjun Patiala, Diljit Dosanjh and Kriti Sanon are in this film
 ye donon hi industry main apane naam ko banane main lage hue hai
 Apart from this, the film has got a mixed reaction
 badi starcast naa hone or kharaab verde of mouth kii vajah se arjuna patiala kaa nuksaan jhelana laazmi hoga
 Apart from this, there is also a big difference in the number of screens of both films
 jahaan jajmental he kya ko lagbhag 2000 screens par relies kiya gaya he vahiin arjuna patiala 1200 se 1500 screens par relies hui he
 Talking about the box office earnings, it is estimated that Kangana's judgmental can collect about 4 to 5 crores
 jabaki ummid he ki arjuna patiala 2 se 3 karod rupee kaa collection kar sakati he
 Now what will happen next, only time will tell
 pratik babbar ko apni acting par kaam karne kii sakht zarurat he, or amyra ko bhi

 In response to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement in Parliament regarding the CAG report, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh has said that the state government had suggested allocation of sufficient number of coal blocks to the state mining corporation for completion of the state's projects
 
 yah suzav rajya ke hiton ko dhyaan main rakhkar diya gaya tha
 Singh said that the state government had written a letter to the Union coal minister in May 2005 and the Prime Minister in June 2005, suggesting that the sudden change in the policy of allocation of coal blocks would adversely affect the steel, iron and power projects under construction in Chhattisgarh
 unhone kaha ki nirmaanadhin pariyojnaon ke liye prachlit niti ke tahat kol block aavantit kiye jaaen yaa phir rajya kii pariyojnaon kii purti ke liye rajya khanan corporation ko paryaapt sankhya main kol block aavantit kar die jaaen
 The Chief Minister said that the state government had said that if the central government decides to allocate coal through competitive bidding, then a part of the amount received from it should also be given to the state in which the coal block is located
 ab centre ne jo nai niti banaai he usamen hamaari maang ke anusaar praavdhaan kiya gaya he ki rajya khanan corporation ko bina nilaamee ke kol block die jaaenge
 Private companies will be given coal blocks through competitive bidding and the amount received in the bid will be given to the concerned state government

 purv cricketer yuvaraj singh or actor angad bedi kii dosti sholay ke jai viru se kam nahin he
 In real life, both are exemplified by friendship
 haalanki har dosti main kabhi naa kabhi mushkil vakt bhi jarur aata he
 Probably a difficult time is currently going on for Yuvraj and Angad
 jab se angad bedi ne actress neha dhoopiya se shaadi kii he tabhi se yuvaraj singh or angad bedi ko saath main nahin dekha gaya
 Yuvraj Singh gave a retirement party to all his friends after his retirement from cricket
 lekin is party main angad bedi or unki patni neha dhoopiya nahin pahunche the
 People from cricket to Bollywood had reached Yuvraj Singh's retirement party
 yahaan tak ki unki yuvi kii eks garlfriend kim sharma bhi party main shaamil huin
 Now in the party in which everyone comes, if the best friend of Yuvraj does not come then there will be no doubt
 spotboy kii khabar ke mutabik yuvaraj singh, angad bedi se naaraaz hai or isiilie unhone angad or unki patni neha ko apni party main nahin bulaayaa tha
 It is reported that the reason for Yuvraj's displeasure is Angad Bedi marrying Neha Dhupia without telling him
 asal main mana jaataa he ki yuvaraj singh ne saal 2014 main neha dhoopiya ko thode samay ke liye date kiya tha
 Yuvraj Singh did not like the fact that his best friend not only decided to get married, but also got married without him
 yuvaraj ko bhi angad or neha kii shaadi ke bare main baaki duniya ke saath pataa chalaa tha

 Why was the delay delayed? There were several reasons why the Delhi government was constantly late in buying DTC buses
 jisamen se ek dilli hai court main lagi yachika bhi thi
 The petition challenged the Delhi government's decision to purchase 2000 standard floor buses
 2 saal tak is maamle main sunwaayee chali or isi saal june main court ne apana faisla suna diya
 The petition was filed by advocate Nipun Malhotra, stating that the Delhi government is going to buy standard floor buses instead of low-floor buses, disregarding the disabled

 How long has it been to call someone an uncle
 aaj jawaharlal nehru kii 125veen jayanti par yah shabd tamaam rishtedaariyon se bada ho gaya he
 Well, there is an uncle of 125 years
 taaoo hokar to vah dada bhi ho saktaa he or chachaa to he hi taaoo main
 What does uncle mean to us
 main nehru kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 If there is an uncle in the social system around us, then how are his memories
 vah kaisaa hota he
 Just like a husband is looking for a friend other than a wife, just like a wife is looking for a friend other than a husband, perhaps we are looking for a father other than a father
 chachaa hota he to sab ho jaataa he
 a friend in the absence of a father and a friend before becoming friends with someone in life
 chachaa kaa kandhaa bhi baap jaisaa hi lagata he
 Childhood wants to climb with that right and puts some hand in their pocket and takes some groping
 toffee yaa chavanni
 i do not know how literature tells uncle
 to ham sab apane apane jivan main maujuud chaachaaon ko yaad kyon nahin kar sakate
 Did Nehru write a will to call me uncle only on my birthday
 apane chachaa ko chachaa mat kahana
 Uncle or uncle
 kitna pyaar he
 Apart from parents
 kuch extra sa
 Everything is not like a dream saare achche rishte khwaab main hote hai
 Occur in the stories of angels
 achche rishte main bhi khatas hoti he or bure main bhi kuch achchhai
 Life is like a relationship
 rishta hi to jivan he
 If we remember the uncles, then what kind of picture of the society will be made in front of us
 kahin isi dar se to ham ek hi chachaa ko yaad nahin karte
 Forget the uncle around you
 kisi kii maa kii yaadon main koi chachaa kaise rahe honge hamen nahin maaloom
 To be an uncle would have to be bigger or smaller than the mother
 pita se bada yaa chota hona hoga
 Neighbors can also be uncles
 chachaa ke hone ke saath maa ke saath saamaajik sambandhon kii smritiyaan kisi banati hongi
 How many houses will have stories of raising the hands of uncles
 kitne gharon main chachaa ke apane bhai ko devtaa samajhane ke kisse amar honge
 Many uncles must have held the nephew's mothers in the feudalistic structure, and many have taken them out to a new world
 chachaa se pehle vah yaa to jeth hota he yaa devar
 And when there is a brother-in-law and brother-in-law, then there is no scope for such romantic interpretation of relationships
 bahut sari talkhiyaan or bahut sari mastiyaan ek saath takaraane lagati hai
 Then an uncle comes out of it
 ham sabko apane apane chaachaaon se jude sandarbhon ko yaad karnaa chahie
 belief-disbelief, taunts-appreciations Everything
 bevajaah irshyaa to beintahaa pyaar
 Uncle has a complicated relationship
 vah ek hi saath saamaajik system se baahar azaadi kaa pratik he, jiske saath aap barabari se baat kar sakate hai to yah bhi ho saktaa he ki aapaki maa usee chachaa ke saamne gair baraabar ho jaaya karti hogi
 Pallu would have pulled on the head or would have been happy on seeing it
 smritiyon kaa samandar hamaare saamaajik jivan main baahar aane ke liye hilode maar rahaa he or ham hai ki sirf ek hi chachaa ko yaad kar khush ho ja rahe hai
 Uncle Nehru will be in everyone's life
 unhen yaad karke dekhte hai
 a hero like Nehru is an elixir or a legend who is hidden behind uncle Nehru's birthday every time
 to aapke chachaa kaise the

Lashing out at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani said the UPA government scandal has embarrassed the entire nation
 adwani ne kaha, ‘jab bharat ne sansadeey loktantr apanaaya tha tab winstal churchill samet duniya ke bade netaaon ne hamaari aalochana kii thi
 But in later years, India proved itself to be a successful democracy
 ’ apni janchetana yatra ke gujarat main pravesh karne par unhone kaha, ‘haalanki samprag shasankaal ke kai ghotaalon ne raashtra ko badnaam kar diya
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and (congress President) Sonia Gandhi have embarrassed the country's parliamentary democracy
 ’unhone aarope lagaaya, ‘main pehle pradhanmantri kaa sammaan karata tha lekin jis tarah unhone bhrasht tareeke se 2008 kaa vishwaas prastaav jeeta koi bhi unhen saansadon kii kharidfrokht ke madhyam se sarkaar bachaane ke liye maaf nahin kar paaegaa
 Praising Modi, Advani said, "gujarat is the only state in the country where there is good governance and Swaraj
" yah narendra modi ke yogya netritv ke tahat sambhav hua he
 On the issue of black money, he said that if the 25 lakh crore rupees hidden in foreign banks are brought back, then every village will get four crore rupees for development
 modi ne gujarat or daman kii seemaa vaapi main adwani kaa joardaar swaagat kiya
 State BJP President RC Faldu was also present on the occasion
 modi ne apane sambodhan main kaha, ‘jab bhi bhrashtachar kii charchaa hoti he vah congress ke khilaaf hoti he
 Both are synonymous with each other
 bhale hi (ek samay) rajeev gandhi ne baari bahumat se chunaav jeeta ho lekin boforce ghotaale ne unhen satta se baahar kar diya
 'he said,' Gujarat will not tolerate corruption
 raashtra bhi ise bardaasht nahin karegaa
 Gujarat has been the first state to raise its voice against corruption and that too was voiced against the Chimanbhai Patel rule of the Congress
 ’modi ne kaha, ‘koi baat nahin ki koun se bhrasht log satta main he lekin unhen logon kii maang ke samaksh jhukna hoga
 Because the public knows everything
 ’ unhone kaha ki yadi ichha shakti he to sarkaar bina bhrashtachar ke hi chalaayi ja sakati he
 He said, 'congress leaders say that they are helpless about corruption but i say it is their helplessness, not ours
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf sangharsh jari rahegaa, chaahe vah anna hajaare, baba ramdev yaa adwaniji ke madhyam se ho
 Describing the central government as mute and deaf, Modi said, "why does the Congress not say to bring black money into India
" vah kyon subah se shaam tak media ke liye bayaan jari karne main din nikaal detii he
 'he said,' When the Congress hurls mud at the BJP, the lotus blossoms

 In response to bjp's Narendra Modi, it was believed that the Congress would soon announce Rahul Gandhi's name as a PM candidate
 lekin sutron kii maane to congress philhal aisa koi faisla nahin karne vaali he
 It is believed that a decision will be taken only after the results of the Lok Sabha elections and after talks with allies
 ise congress kii alag ranneeti kaa hissaa bhi mana ja saktaa he
 The BJP had already opened its cards by declaring Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate for the Lok Sabha elections
 ab dabaav main wo congress party he jisane abtak apane piem ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan nahin kiya he
 Although till now it was believed that in the cold of January, the news of warming the politics will come out of the Congress corridor and Rahul can be made the face of the party's PM post, but the big news is that it is going to happen Expectation is extremely low
 sutron ke mutabik, 2014 aam chunaav se pehle congress rahul gandhi ko bataur piem ummidavaar ghoshit nahin kar sakati he, yani sambhaavna behad kam he
 Who will be the candidate for the post of PM from the Congress can be decided only after the results of the Lok Sabha elections

 However, the news of the sources is also that under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi, the Congress will contest the Lok Sabha elections and in the wake of the elections, Rahul Gandhi will decide everything
 mana ja rahaa he ki 17 janvari ko congress kaaryakarini kii baithak main rahul ke netritv par kuch thos elaan bhi ho saktaa he
 There is also news that Priyanka Gandhi will help Vadra from behind the scenes
 party sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, congress kii daleel he ki bharat main america kii tarah chunaav se pehle hi piem pad ke ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa nahin kii ja sakati he or bijepi kii tarah kisi kaa naam aage nahin kiya jayega
 Apart from this, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh himself and Union Minister Jairam Ramesh have already opposed the announcement of Rahul as the Prime Ministerial candidate
 ab intjaar he 17 janvari kaa jab congress kaaryakarini kii baithak main ye tay hoga ki rahul gandhi ko congress kii chunavi baitarani paar karaane ke liye koun si badi jimmedaari milti he

 This is a big attack on the Constitution
 sena kaa raajnneetikaran nahin karnaa chahie
 At the same time Venkaiah Naidu said that this is a sensitive matter as it is related to the army

 ' box offis par agar kamai ke dangal kii baat karen to takkar sirf teen khaanon ke bich he yani shahrukh, aamir or salmaan
 Although all three Khans distance themselves from the race of figures, the audience and film experts always keep an eye on the box office records of these three
 salmaan khan kii 'sultan' or aamir khan kii 'dangal' maidan main akele utrin par shahrukh kii 'rais' kaa box offis par ruthik roshan kii 'kaabil' se muqabla he
 In such a situation, the loss of more or less is falling on the collections of both films and even Shah Rukh Khan does not deny this
 unka kahana he, 'agar donon filmein aamane saamne nahin hotin to hamane 3 dinon main zyada kamai kar lee hoti par ab hamen thodaa vakt or lagegaa lekin phir bhi ham apane lakshya tak pahonchege
 Comments ab gaur karne vaali baat yab he ki kya 'rais' 'dangal' or 'sultan' ko pachhad paaegi
 The answer to this question is still late, but film experts believe that despite the good debut of 'raees', it seems impossible for Shahrukh to portray Aamir in the statistics game

 Union Minister Arun Jaitley has quipped over Rahul Gandhi's decision to hand over the command of the National Security Task Force to DS Hooda, who was associated with the surgical strike
 kendriya mantri arun jetali ne congress par chutki lete hue kaha ki yah ascharyajanak he ki paanch dashak tak shashan karne vaali congress ko rashtriya suraksha ke mudde par paath padhanaa pad rahaa he
 Arun Jaitley's statement comes at a time when the party has handed over the command of the National Security Task Force to DS Hooda, who was associated with the surgical strike
 arun jetali ne congress se kaha ki use aisa sanket nahin dena chahie ki aatankwaad ke mudde par bharat banta hua he
 Taking cognizance of Lt General Hooda's experience, Arun Jaitley said, 'there is no doubt in my mind that he will give valuable suggestions to the oldest party (congress)
 'vitt mantri ne apane blog main likhaa ki sevanivruth sainya adhikari kii niyukti sargical strike ko der se pradaan kii gai manyata evam sweekruti he jisase hooda jude the
 He said, 'I am confident that the advisory panel will tell the party leaders that the surgical strike was not a regular step which was taken in the past but was the first important step for India
 'congress kii ore se modi sarkaar par sargical strike kaa raajnneetikaran karne kaa aarope lagaaya jaataa rahaa he
 The surgical strike was carried out on 29 September 2016 by the Army, targeting several terrorist targets across the Line of Control
 arun jetali ne kaha ki ek aise dal jisane aadhi shatabdi tak desh par shashan kiya, uske sambandh main yah aashascharyajanak he ki rashtriya suraksha ke mudde par use paath padhanaa pad rahaa he
 Earlier, Arun Jaitley said that India would use all diplomatic or other measures to win a decisive battle against Pakistan responsible for the suicide terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district

 Kohli has shown something similar
 srilanka ke khilaaf 2008 main debyue karne ke baad kohli ne ab tak kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Kohli has already overtaken master blaster Sachin Tendulkar in many fields, and if this consistency continues, the day is not far when Kohli will become the best ODI batsman in the world
 centuri se match jitaane vaale kohli
 
 
 With his performance in the recently concluded series against Sri Lanka, Kohli proved that now his shoulders are ready to take responsibility
 yah baat kohli ne srilanka ke khilaaf antim vanade main sabit kar di
 Despite the difficult pitch of Ranchi on one side and the continuous wickets falling on the other side, despite this, Kohli acted with restraint and patience, and playing a brilliant unbeaten 139 runs, India reached the destination of victory
 kohli ke bare main aksar log ye maanate hai ki wo bahut aakraamak cricketer hai, lekin haal hi main unhone khud par or apane gusse par jis tarah kaa control dikhaaya he wo laajawab he
 In the series against Sri Lanka, Kohli recorded several records in front of his own name
 kohli vanade cricket main sabase jaldi 21 shatak lagane vaale ballebaaj ban gaye hai
 Kohli did this feat in just 138 innings
 vahiin sachin tendulkar ne 21waan shatak 200veen or saurav ganguli ne apni 217veen pari main puraa kiya tha
 Kohli will now have an eye on these records
 lakshya kaa peechha karte hue jeet main kohli kaa ye 13waan shatak tha
 While Sachin Tendulkar chased the target in odis, he had the highest total of 14 centuries to win
 jiske liye sachin ne kul 452 paariyaan khelin, jabaki kohli ne maatr 138
 After this, Saeed Anwar and Sanath Jayasuriya are at number three with 9–9 centuries
 2
 Kohli is now jointly at number five with Chris Gayle and Herschelle Gibbs in the list of those who have scored the most ODI centuries
 kohli ab sirf sachin (49), riki ponting (30), sanath jayasoorya (28) or saurav ganguli (22) se hi peeche rah gaye hai
 3
 kohli ne 2014 calendar varsh main vanade cricket main 1000 ran puure kiye
 For the last 4 years he has managed to achieve
 iske saath hi unhone purv captain saurav ganguli (1997, 1998, 1999 or 2000) kii barabari kar lee he
 Kohli has also added a unique record to his name
 kohli dwipaksheeya siries main desh or videsh donon jagahon par clin sweep karne vaale bharat ke pehle captain ban gaye
 Kohli-led Team India also defeated Zimbabwe 5–0 on their soil before winning the 5–0 series against Sri Lanka
 in tamaam uplabdhiyon ko dekhakar lagata nahin he ki kohli naam kaa tufaan abhi thamane vaala he
 It is said that all efforts are useless in front of hard work and Kohli has also proved it
 jitani lagan or mehnat unhone cricket ke prati dikhaai he isane cricket jaise mahaan khel ke str ko or upar uthaa diya he
 Recently, rumors spread about the mobile number being 13 digits among people including social media
 bhaajapa rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki yah afvaah congress kii taraf se failaai gai
 He accused this by tweeting
 iske alaava unhone echardiai bill ko lekar bhi afvaah failaane kaa aarope congress par lagaaya
 Amit Shah said in his tweet that Congress spread the rumor of having a 13-digit mobile number on social media
 jabaki sachai yah he ki 13 ankon ke nae number sim aadhaarit mashin tu mashin (M2M) sanchaar ke liye uplabdh karaae jane hai
 He said that it has nothing to do with normal mobiles
 congress ne 13 ankon ke mobile number kaa jhooth soshal media par failaayaa, jabaki sachai yah he ki 13 ankon ke nae number sim aadhaarit mashin tu mashin (M2M) sanchaar ke liye uplabdh karaae jane hai
 It has nothing to do with the normal mobile number
 — Amit Shah (@amitshah)march 5, 2018unhone ek or twit kiya
 In this, he accused the Congress of spreading confusion in the name of technology
 unhone is twit main aarope lagaaya ki jahaan modi sarkaar technology ko badhaava dene main juty hui he
 At the same time, the Congress is creating fear in the minds of people by spreading confusion about technology
 modi sarkaar technology se har bhartiya ko jodna chaahati he, sarkari sevaaon kaa laabh sidhaa janata tak pahunche iske liye bahut bada abhiyaan shuru kiya he tab congress technology ke bare main bhram failaakar janata ke bich bhay paidaa karnaa chaahati he
 - Amit Shah (@amitshah) March 5, 2018 The government had made a clear picture about it by the Telecom Ministry after rumors arose on social media about the mobile number
 mantralay ne saaf kiy tha ki 1 july se sabhi telecom companiyon ko 10 kii jagah 13 number kaa M2M sim card jari karnaa hoga
 These sims look like a normal SIM, but they are not used in your normal mobile phone
 M2M sim kaa istemaal sirf data transmit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 This means that you cannot make voice calls with this
 FRDI bill ko lekar bhi gheriumit shah ne financial rejolution and diposit insurance (echardiai) bill ko lekar mache hangaamen ko lekar bhi congress ko gheraa
 He said that this bill is still in the initial stage and Congress spread rumors about it and put itself in the dock
 FRDI kaa jo bill abhi charchaa main hi he us par afvaah failaakar or janata ko bhramit karke congress ne khud ko hi kathghare main khadaa kiya he
 Whereas this bill is to ensure that public money is protected
 — Amit Shah (@amitshah)march 5, 2018kya he echardiai bilfinancial rejolution and diposit insurance bill (echardiai bill) vittiya sansthaanon ke diwalia hone kii sthiti se nipatane ke liye banaaya ja rahaa he
 Whenever a bank will not be able to conduct its business and will not be able to return the money of the common people deposited with them, this FRDI bill will help that bank to get out of this crisis
 bharat ke samvidhan kii dhara 51-e main kaha gaya he ki bharat ke prayek naagarik kaa yah kartavya hoga ki vah vaigyanik drushtikon, maanavvaad or gnanarjan tathaa sudhaar kii bhaavana kaa vikaas kare

 Once Yashpal went door-to-door through the Turning Point program on Doordarshan, it can be called the first popular science program in the world of channels
 vigyaan ke kaarykram aaj bhi hai magar unamem vigyaan kam he andhvishwaas zyaada he
 The journalists of India are searching for superstitions by taking torches in the ruins of faith, taking the name science
 ab to andhvishwaas bhi science or raajnneeti vigyaan kaa chapter lagata he

 Must be asking for UR Rao as well
 24 july ko bengaluru main antariksh vigyaani yuar raav kaa nidhan ho gaya
 In 1975, UR Rao launched India's first satellite Arya Bhatt
 bharat main spes technology main unke yogadan kii kahani ek tivi sho ke bas kii baat nahin he
 At the age of 85, he was the Chairman of the Governing Council of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, Chancellor of the Indian Institute of Science and Technology in Thiruvananthapuram
 das saal tak isro ke chairman rahe
 The development journey of PSLV, GSLV rocket cannot be complete without UR Rao
 350 se adhik scientific or technical paper prakashit kiye
 Wrote many books
 ek jivan main kitna kuch kar gaye, apane liye nahin, aapke or hamaare liye kiya
 On March 19, 2013, his name was included in the Satellite Hall of Frame in Washington DC
 vahaan jagah paane vaale ve pehle bhartiya antariksh vigyaani the
 Nowadays we also understand science as technology, but there is a difference between the two
 bharat main vigyaan or karmkand ke jhagade main hameshaa dharm apane khatare lekar haazir hota rahaa he
 Talking science beyond a limit is called anti-religion
 aaj myth bhi science he kyonki myth main jinka yakeen he unhen lagata he ki unke saath sarkaar he
 a book found on the Internet, Collected Works of Justice RA Jahagirdar, is the name of the book Scientific Temper
 isamen scientific temper ke bare main justise e jahagirdaar ne likhaa he ki yah ek maansik avasthaa he jisamen jaanane kii pyaas hoti he, jo yah maanati he ki dekhte rahane se, prayog karne se or anubhav karne se gyaan hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 Knowledge is not gained by speculation
 jab tak sakshya na ho, sachcha vaigyanik man sweekaar nahin karegaa
 The scientific mind is not afraid of the truth, maybe its truth goes against the established beliefs of the society
 scientif temper vaigyanikon kaa hi ekadhikaar nahin hota he
 Not all scientists even express scientific temper in their daily lives
 kisi ko hairaani nahin honi chahie ki estronomi khagolashastra kaa professor suryagrahan ke baad nadi snaan karata ho
 i do not know about Justice Jahangirdar
 magar internet par kitaab mili to pehali hi pankti se dilchaspee paidaa ho gai
 There is one more information in this book
 july 1981 main mumbai ke nehru centre kii taraf se vidwaanon ke ek samooh ne scientific temper par ek bayaan jari kiya tha
 It said that the method of science provides a solid way to acquire knowledge
 insaan kii samasya ko vigyaan ke arjeet gyaan ke aadhaar par samajha or dur kiya ja saktaa he
 For the survival and progress of human life, it is necessary that science is used in every aspect of life, from ethics, politics to economics
 sweekaar karnaa hoga ki vigyaan se arjeet gyaan hi satya ke nazadik he
 When science came out of Yashpal's tinkling voice, there was no heavy burden on him
 1993 main shiksha sudhaar ke liye unke netritv main bani cameti ke bagaiyr to aap bharat main shiksha vyavastha kii samasya or samaadhaan par baat hi nahin kar sakate
 He wanted to taunt by-laws, lighten the burden of bags, and reduce the terror of examinations laden with facts and information

 pudukottay zile kii colector ek yuva iees afasar shaali rani chunakath kii kahani he
 In the form of Kamix, this book shows how this IAS officer made it mandatory for women in his district to learn bicycle in the ongoing literacy campaign
 phir kya tha vahaan kii auraton or ladakiyon kii zindagi hi badal gai
 The anecdote will be old, but after reading it was thrilled
 arvind gupta kii ek kitaab 'khilone kaa bastaa' padhiega

 Want to remember Yashpal
 unke na hone se kya hota hua dikh rahaa he, unke hone par kya-kya hota tha
 a book found on the Internet, Collected Works of Justice RA Jahagirdar, is the name of the book Scientific Temper
 isamen scientific temper ke bare main justise e jahagirdaar ne likhaa he ki yah ek maansik avasthaa he jisamen jaanane kii pyaas hoti he, jo yah maanati he ki dekhte rahane se, prayog karne se or anubhav karne se gyaan hasil kiya ja saktaa he
 Knowledge is not gained by speculation
 jab tak sakshya na ho, sachcha vaigyanik man sweekaar nahin karegaa
 The scientific mind is not afraid of the truth, maybe its truth goes against the established beliefs of the society
 scientif temper vaigyanikon kaa hi ekadhikaar nahin hota he
 Not all scientists even express scientific temper in their daily lives
 kisi ko hairaani nahin honi chahie ki estronomi khagolashastra kaa professor suryagrahan ke baad nadi snaan karata ho
 i do not know about Justice Jahangirdar
 magar internet par kitaab mili to pehali hi pankti se dilchaspee paidaa ho gai
 There is one more information in this book
 july 1981 main mumbai ke nehru centre kii taraf se vidwaanon ke ek samooh ne scientific temper par ek bayaan jari kiya tha
 It said that the method of science provides a solid way to acquire knowledge
 insaan kii samasya ko vigyaan ke arjeet gyaan ke aadhaar par samajha or dur kiya ja saktaa he
 For the survival and progress of human life, it is necessary that science is used in every aspect of life, from ethics, politics to economics
 sweekaar karnaa hoga ki vigyaan se arjeet gyaan hi satya ke nazadik he
 When science came out of Yashpal's tinkling voice, there was no heavy burden on him
 1993 main shiksha sudhaar ke liye unke netritv main bani cameti ke bagaiyr to aap bharat main shiksha vyavastha kii samasya or samaadhaan par baat hi nahin kar sakate
 He wanted to taunt by-laws, lighten the burden of bags, and reduce the terror of examinations laden with facts and information
 pro
 Yashpal wanted to expand understanding

 We could convince them very rarely for a 'humlog' program
 arvind gupta ne marathi, hindi or angrezi main vigyaan ko saral banane ke liye kya-kya nahin kiya
 Not knowing how many thousands went to schools, how many millions of children laughed with their toys and learned science by laughing
 'cycle or mahilaayein' shandaar kitaab he hindi main
 The Collector of Pudukottay district is the story of a young IAS officer, Shali Rani Chunakath
 kamiks kii shakl main is kitaab main dikhaaya gaya he ki kaise is iees afasar ne apane zile kii mahilaon ke liye chal rahe sakshartaa abhiyaan main cycle siikhnaa anivaary kar diya

 yashpal ko yaad karnaa chaahate hai
 What is happening with their absence is seen, what happens when they happen
 justise jahagirdaar ke bare main main nahin jaanata hum
 But when the book was found on the Internet, the first line generated interest
 is kitaab main ek or jaankaree he
 In July 1981, a statement on the scientific taper was issued by a group of scholars on behalf of the Nehru Center in Mumbai
 isamen kaha gaya ki vigyaan kaa tarika gyaan arjeet karne kaa ek thos rasta uplabdh karaata he
 The problem of man can be understood and overcome on the basis of acquired knowledge of science
 maanav zindagi ke astitv or pragati ke liye zaruri he ki jivan ke har pahalu main naitikta, raajnneeti se lekar arthshaastra tak main vigyaan kaa istamaal ho
 One has to accept that knowledge acquired from science is close to the truth
 yashpal kii khanakdaar awaz se vigyaan jab nikalataa tha to us par baste kaa baari boj nahin hota tha
 Without a committee formed under his leadership for reform of education in 1993, you cannot talk about the problem and solution of education system in India
 ve imtahaanon ko tata-by-by karnaa chaahate the, baste kaa boj halkaa karnaa chaahate, tathyon or soochnaaon se ladi parikshaon kaa aatank kam karnaa chaahate the

 yashpal chaahate the ki samaj kaa vistaar ho

 He said that India was no longer the country where there was inertia in policies and uncertain tax system
 unhone nivesh anukool maahaul ke vikaas ke liye sudhaaron ko jari rakhane kaa aashwaasan diya
 Jaitley said, the Bankruptcy Code is ready and changes in the arbitration law and many other laws are in process

 He was in talks with about 300 Singapore-based industrialists, investors and representatives of global entities from Europe and America

 This is the first leg of the journey
 tippaniyan Apparently citing lack of strength in the Rajya Sabha, he said that the bills which can be taken as money bills will be taken forward
 rajyasabha main sankhya bal nahin hone se sarkaar pramukh vidheyakon ko aage nahin badha paa rahi he
 He, however, regretted that the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a major bill related to indirect tax reform, could not be passed in the last session of Parliament
 unhone kaha ki bharat ab vah desh nahin rahaa jahaan nitiyon main jadta or anishchit tex vyavastha thi
 He assured to continue the reforms to develop an investment friendly environment
 jetali ne kaha, diwaliyapan samhita taiyaar he or madhyasthata kanoon tathaa kai anya kanoonon main badlaav prakriya main hai
 
 
 Our agenda is complete for the next few years and improvement is an ongoing process

 The Finance Minister is on a four-day visit to Singapore and Hong Kong

 The comments spasht rup se rajyasabha main sankhya bal kam hone kaa hawala dete hue unhone kaha ki jin vidheyakon ko dhan vidheyak ke rup main liya ja saktaa he, use aage badhaayaa jayega
 Due to lack of numbers in the Rajya Sabha, the government is not able to move the major bills
 haalanki, unhone is baat par afsos jataayaa ki apratyaksh kar sudhaar se judaa pramukh vidheyak vastu evam seva kar (jiesti) ko sansad ke pichley satr main paarit nahin karaayaa ja sakaa

 On the incidents of mob lynching, he said that it is a crime to take up law and violence on any issue, not the cow itself and strict action should be taken in such cases
 bhagwat ne kaha ki kanoon haath main lene vaale aparaadhiyon ko sajaa hona chahie, lekin aage unhone ye bhi kaha ki gaay shraddha kaa vishay he
 Also, Bhagwat also told the importance of the cow
 unhone kaha ki gaay desh ke chote kisaan kii arthvyavastha kaa bada aadhaar ban sakati he
 Double standards on violence
 He emphasized that cow protection is necessary, it will benefit the country in many ways
 bhagwat ne kaha, 'goraksha honi chahie or uskaa paalan karnaa chahie
 Cow protection is not just by law
 agar naagarik gaay nahin paalenge to raksha kaise hogi
 Bhagwat further said, 'whatever use the cow can have, attention should be given to it
 goraksha bahut log kar rahe hai
 Those who are not associated with the Sangh are also engaged in this work
 desh main bhakthi ke saath goshaala chalaane vaale musalmaan bhi kaaphi hai
 On the incidents of violence in the name of cow, Bhagwat said that when Gotskar attacks, there is no talk on him, but when mob lynching happens, a voice is raised against him

 Do not link to mob lynchings: The RSS chief further said that those who are miscreants should not be associated with cow protection

" charchaa main sabase pehle ashutosh ne kaha hindu raashtra apane aap main ek project he
 And it starts from 1925

 Savarkar writes in his book that those who talk of mercy, compassion, compassion weaken the Hindu

 lekin agar ve yahaan rahanaa chaahate hai to ham unke bare main soch sakate hai
 If this is the definition of our Hindu nation, then we do not want such a Hindu nation

 ) After being relieved of the post of Leader of the Opposition and being made the President of the Parliamentary Party, LK Advani announced on Friday that "do not think that the Advani era is over
" ’’ unhone raajnneetik sakriyata ke saath hi bhaajapa ke sarathi bane rahane kaa iraadaa saaf kar diya
 The parliamentary party of the Bharatiya Janata Party amended its constitution and elected Advani as the chairman (chairman) of the parliamentary party unanimously
 adhyaksh kii haisiyat se adwani ne apane pehle faisle main sushamaa swaraj ko loksabhaa or arun jetali ko rajyasabha main vipaksh kaa netaa niyukt kiya
 With these appointments, the exercise to take the BJP towards the new leadership started in the new year
 shanivaar ko hone vaali bhaajapa sansadeey board kii baithak main rajnath singh apana adhyakshiya taj maharashtra ke pradesh adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko pehanaane ja rahe hai
 In this way, relatively young leadership (below 60) will occupy all three effective positions
 loksabhaa ke pichley chunaav main haar ke baad party main jari kalah ke is parivartan ke saath patakshep kii ummiden sangh parivaar kar rahaa he
 This change was designed by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 alabatta adwani ke raajnneeti ke haashiye main pahunch jane kii atakalein sach nahin ban paayin
 It was believed that Advani would retire from politics, denying all this in his own words and said, "today i saw such pleasures in the newspapers that 'advani era will end today' or 'rathayatri today will get off the chariot
' 
 lekin agar ve samajhate hai ki adwani sakriyata chhod denge yaa adwani raajnneeti chhod denge to ve sab galat hai
 "advani said that he had become a chariot by the age of 14 and" If anyone says that Advani got off the chariot, i am not going to leave him (the chariot)
 " jivan bhar chalegi meri rathyatra
 Advani, who became the closest gritty of the Sangh Parivar to his remarks about Jinnah in 2005 during his visit to Pakistan, was able to maintain his political existence despite all the ups and downs
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa sansadeey dal ke adhyaksh ke rup main ‘‘mere jivan or meri raajnneeti main ek nayaa adhyay shuru hua he
 He said that he is feeling relieved and full satisfaction when the leader leaves the opposition
 raahat isliye ki sakriy raajnneeti main rahane ke baavjood ab javabdehi unki nahin rahegi
 Recalling his relationship with the Sangh, the BJP leader said that if he had not been active as a Rajasthan campaigner, he might not have been in politics today
 unhone aaj kii peedi ke raajnneetikon par tikhi tippanee karte hue kaha, ‘‘aaj raajnneeti main aane vaale raajnneeti ko aisa kaary maanate hai, jisase dhan kamaaya ja sake
 Strength can be created and influence can be made
 ’’ unhone kaha, lekin yah maansikta ‘vyaktigat agenda’ he jabaki aazaadee kii ladaai ke samay raajnneetikon kaa aisa vyaktigat agenda nahin hua karata tha
 He also admitted, "but it is very difficult
 ’’ adwani ne kaha ki bhaajapa main vyaktigat agenda jitna kam hoga, party utani adhik bharat kii seva kar sakegi
 He indirectly commented on the mutual tussle for the posts, saying that today the railway compartment has become a mentality in politics
 saath hi kaha ki rail ke dibbe main jitne log chadh jate hai, ve chaahate hai ki baaki log usamen na ghusane paayen, bhale hi usamen siten khaali kyon na hon
 Advani warned the party to avoid such a tendency
 parivartan ke is prahar main bhi adwani kaa ‘modi prem’ ek baar phir mukhar hua
 He said that he had spoken to Modi on Friday morning

 He said, "there has been a change of posts, but the system will continue as before

 Earlier, Mulayam's brother Shivpal started an attempt to merge six Samajwadi parties Samajwadi Party, Janata Dal United, Rashtriya Janata Dal, Janata Dal, Secular / National Lok Dal and Samajwadi Janata Party to form a party at the national level, but the campaign Did not succeed uske baad ye chunavi gathbandhan bana
 a section of the Samajwadi Party believes that if Mulayam separates from the alliance, it may seem that he has done this to benefit the BJP, which may have to bear the brunt in UP
 upi ke cabinet mantri or mulaayam ke bhai shivpal yadav ne kaha, 'dekhie ham sab log ikattha hokar jo ye bhaajapa he, inako humlog benakaab karenge, jo jhooth bol kar ke janata ko gumraah kiya he
 So we will remain united
 tippaniyan The Samajwadi Party in Bihar is as strong as the RJD or JDU in UP
 haalanki najariye kii ladaai main gathbandhan kaa mahatv he
 But the loss of lalu-nitish will be more than the loss of alliance, perhaps more than Mulayam
 lekin hoga kya ye 8-9 sitambar tak hi pataa chal paaegaa
 First two hearts meet, then two families
 mulaayam ke pote kii muhabbat lalu kii beti se ho gai
 The two tied the knot and as a result the two dynasties became one dynasty
 lekin muhabbat or siyasat main fark he naa
 Although the balance sheet of love may not be made, politics is done after seeing the loss of profit
 isliye bihar chunaav main sirf 5 siten milane se mulaayam khafa hai
 However, at the time of marriage, they were telling him the support of Janam Janam
 naaraaz mulaayam lalu-nitish or sonia kii mahareli main bhi nahin pahunche
 On persuading Lalu, younger brother was sent to Shivpal
 ye mahagathbandhan shivpal kii hi raajnneeti kaa nateeja he
 Mulayam may not be a big force in Bihar and lalu-nitish in UP, but at the national level, it looks like a big coalition and Bihar elections are a big force

 Angry Mulayam did not even reach the grandeur of lalu-nitish and Sonia
 lalu ke manaane par chote bhai shivpal ko bhej diya
 This grand alliance is the result of Shivpal's politics
 bhale bihar main mulaayam or upi main lalu-nitish badi takat naa hon lekin rashtriya str ye bada gathbandhan dikhataa he or bihar chunaav ek badi takat najar aata he
 Some SP leaders want Mulayam to break the alliance, but Lalu has described the relationship with Mulayam as cement
 iske pehle mulaayam ke bhai shivpal ne 6 samaajawaadee dalon samaajawaadee party, janata dal united, rashtriya janata dal, janata dal, secular / neshnal lok dal or samaajawaadee janata party kaa vilay kar rashtriya str par ek party banane kii koshish shuru kii thi, lekin muhim kaamyaab nahin hui
 After that it formed an electoral alliance
 samaajawaadee party main ek varg kaa maananaa he ki agar mulaayam gathbandhan se alag hue to ye lag saktaa he ki aisa unhone bijepi ko phayda pahunchane ke liye kiya he, jiskaa upi main use khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 UP cabinet minister and Mulayam's brother Shivpal Yadav said, "see, we will gather everyone who is this BJP, we will expose them, who have misled the public by lying
 to humlog ek hokar rahenge
 The comments bihar main samaajawaadee party utani hi majboot he jitani upi main argedy yaa jediu
 However, coalition has importance in the battle of attitudes
 lekin gathbandhan todane se lalu-nitish ko jitna nuksaan hoga, shaayad mulaayam ko usase zyada ho
 But will it be known only by September 8-9

 Hamza Shahbaz appears to be healthy
 ve apana pehla intervyuu de rahe hai
 Twenty-four hours later, a court verdict is set in which his tau and three-time wazir-e-azam Nawaz Sharif and ardent cousin Maryam will be convicted
 42 baras ke hamaja roj kasarat karte hai or nile salwar-kameez ke saath apane pherogamas juute date rahete hai
 The elections are now left just two weeks and his party is under constant attack
 aise main chakachaundh se bachane vaale hamaja khulkar saamne aa gaye hai, aakhirkaar saaf ho chukaa he ki ve or unke walid shahabaaz—yani punjab praant ke teen baar ke mukhyamantri or navaj ke chote bhai or kaabil naayab—adalati adngebaaji or nakaabposh takhtapalton kii is sarajameen par shaq-shubahe or khatre se mote taur par baahar hai
 On the other hand, legal beds have been put in the feet of the "other" Sharifs (who were in London till the time this article was published and were taking care of Nawaz's wife, but they had just 12 days before the election on the 13th of the day
 Promised to return and was expected to be arrested as soon as he landed and was taken directly to jail by helicopter)
 aise main, ek jinda shaks ke naam par banaai gai mulk kii akeli party pakistan muslim lig (navaj) ke daftar 180-ech, model toun, lahore main siyaasi hakeekat bilkul saaf he—hamaja kaa vakt aa chukaa he
 a happy army of men and advisors around them is behaving like this
 piemalen main navaj kii tarif na karnaa—khaskar ab jab 68 baras ke navaj ko 10 saal jail kii sajaa sunai ja chuki he or uske baad bhi 10 or saal unhen siyaasi biabaan main bitaane honge, saath hi unhen sarkari ohade ke naakaabil tehraaya ja chukaa he—or khud ko ooncha uthaanaa nikli he
 It also breaks the rules and regulations
 sachaai yah he ki navaj ab bhi voton ko khinchne vaala chumbak hai
 His absence is felt at his party rallies
 shahabaaz apni naatakeey takareeron se or baanhen chadhaakar hausala or raftaar banaae rakhane kii koshish kar rahe hai, par haal hi ke ek galop pole main piemalen ko imran khan kii pakistan taharik-e-insaaf (pitii) se bahut thodaa hi aage dikhaaya gaya tha, jabaki duusari raishumariyon main khan kii badhat dikhaai gai thi
 This created a lot of confusion about the election
 ahm baat yah ki piemalen ke netaa utsukata se us lamhe kaa intjaar karte rahe hai jab navaj apane matadaataaon ke bich aaenge or pratishthan ke khilaaf apni mutthiyaan taanenge
 They are waiting for their blasts for this fragile time — what they say about making the Mumbai attacks possible, or about the sky-high aliens who make puppets (this is new to the military in Pakistan's limelight Code is word) and about why he was removed at the top (his pillow kalam - "why remove me")
 yah intjaar rosemara kii baat thi, jiske chalate maheenon se piemalen ke samarthakon kii taadaad main ijapha hota rahaa, reliyon main jabardast bheed jutati rahi or akhabaaron main hamadardi se bhare sampadakeey likhe jate rahe
 But now, after the 10-month-long trial of Sharif's Mayfair property, two of the most powerful members of the political dynasty, Pakistan's longest-serving dynasty, have been convicted as offenders
 navaj ko chunavi nakshe se hataaya ja chukaa he or unki pratyaksh vaaris or piaar pramukh mariyam ko bhi
 It is a shame that after the conviction of Nawaz, Maryam and his husband Safdar, there was no serious protest in favor of Nawaz, especially in his hometown Lahore
 phir bhi hamaja kuch is tarah jataate hai maano kuch hua hi nahin he
 In his interview, he borrows his father's well-intentioned and nuanced tricks and sets off his tau's aggressive lexicon - "to rule through advice", "great military sacrifices"
 Etcetera
 magar ve sidhe bhidde vaale apane taaoo or kagin ko na to khaarij karte hai or na hi kar sakate hai, jo agar barason se nahin bhi to maheenon se rashtriya suraksha or nyaayik halkon main hangaamaa barapate rahe hai
 But they will not remove the magical words from their tongue, which can give them the blessings of the establishment
 ve kehete hai, "hamaari raay unase ahalada ho sakati he, par navaj sharif ab bhi party ke kaayad (netaa) hai
 "and after airing this interview, i got feedback from a man keeping a close watch on the army headquarters, Rawalpindi -" He's a good guy
 magar sharifon ke liye pardaa gir chukaa he
 "nawaz had almost a year to wager, after being disqualified for the post in July, 2017
 vaaki ve hisaab chuktaa karne ke aatmadahi mishan main jute gaye or vah bhi tiraskrit fouj ke saath
 Stepping foot on the path of war, he put a baroque name in the Prime Minister's chair, instead of letting his capable younger brother take command
 magar iske liye unhen mariyam or unki trolon, pravaktaaon, ankaron or mantriyon kii us media mashin ne uksaaya, jo party ko nahin, sidhe mariyam ko report karti thi
 This led to Nawaz himself being the biggest victim of his downfall — and that was Shahbaz
 fouj jise mote taur par bardaasht karti rahi he, afasarshahi jisaki sachhee izzat karti he, media par maharath jisaki fitrat main he, jo mandarin, german or turki jabaanen bolta he, din main 18 ghante kaam karne vaala josho-kharosh se bharaa shaks he, us shahabaaz sharif ko uske bhai ne hi uttaradhikaar kii daud se baahar kar diya
 When 2018 came and saw the campaign of soldiers and soldiers against the army, the attacks against the army on social and mainstream media became a blatant and unrestrained celebration
 tab sadabahaar bhala sipaahi shahabaaz apane bhai kii dingon or shekhiyon tathaa apni bhatiji ke jabaani hamalon ke liye mafiyaan maangata rahaa, satta pratishthan ke saath badhate or ulajhate tanaavon ko lekar baikfoot par rahaa or aahista-aahista general headquators main peeche ke daravaaje se daakhil hone kii chhot ganvaa baitha
 And then trusted allies were picked up on corruption charges; Favorite journalist disappeared; Opposition leaders made fun of Shahbaz's inability to stand up to the disgraced Nawaz
 aise main rawalpindi main bhi shahabaaz ko ridhhin or kamjor maanakar khaarij kar diya
 As a person who was not ready for a much bigger stage before him
 "agar main apane bhai kaa vafaadaar nahin rahaa, to phir main kiskaa vafaadaar hounga?'' yah baat shahabaaz ne ek saal pehle mujhase ek intervyuu main kahi thi
 Not only this, Nisar Ali Khan, Nawaz's longest-time deputy and former home minister, was also a supporter of the military party and close to Shahbaz — after being sidelined after tensions with Maryam
 is tarah rawalpindi ke saath jodgaye vaali ek or kadi ko kaat diya gaya or chunavi dalbadal kii ek daraar paidaa kar di gai
 The rise of Khan stands a 65-year-old rock in the path of 66-year-old Shahbaz
 in garmiyon main imran ahamed khan niaji ne apni party pitii kii sthapana ke 22 saal puure hone kaa jashn manaaya
 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf, that is, the movement for justice, has become for its millions of followers
 aaj khan ko chunavi raishumariyon main itane zyada vot mil rahe hai ki jitne pehle kabhi kisi survey main nahin mili
 Not only this, he is being given the most credit for making Sharif a failure and a failure
 magar ve yahaan tak apane dam par nahin aae hai
 The winds of change have brought them with them
 yahaan ek maarak aankada he, vaaki
 Pakistan did not reinstate any Gaddisheen party
 jod se yaa tod se, bam se yaa bailat se, takhtapalat se yaa tikadam se, pakistan lagaataar duusare kaarykaal ke liye na to vot detaa he or na hi apane netaaon ko satta main lautne detaa he
 But around the beginning of 2016, just before Panama Leaks revealed details of their foreign companies, Nawaz's return to power seemed certain
 ek uljhe hue talaak or maheene bhar lambey chale utsaahhin daur ke baad 2016 kii shuruyaat main khan biabaan main gum ho gaye the
 But Panama Leaks revitalized the mine
 khan ne twit kiye, reliyaan kin, virodh pradarshan kiye or sharif khandaan ke khilaaf apni bhrashtachar virdohi muhim ko phir doharaaya
 He swore that his London-based crawlts were derived from dishonest earnings
 pehle to koi samajha hi nahin
 off-shore Companies? Don't all Amirzadas have these? London Apartment? Has Sharif not lived there for decades? "panama" quickly changed to "pajamas", indicative of settled fools
 magar khan ne haar nahin maani
 Highly confident, Sharif spoiled his own game
 2016 main islamabad main khan ke virodh pradarshan ko sakhti se dabaane ke baad jab thik unheen dinon ugravadi dhadon ke saath fouj ke rishton kii khabar khatarnaak dhang se ek pratishthan virdohi reporter ko li kii gai, to pasa palat gaya or pratishthan ne morche sambhaal liye
 Then the courts took entry and started the hearing of Panama case fast
 2017 ke pehle aadhe saal khan ko keval supreme court main hi dekha jaataa tha—note lete hue, press conference karte hue, sharif ke kathith vittiya duraachaaron ke forencik byore twit karte hue
 Even then no one thought that this matter would reach anywhere
 magar ek saal pehle aakhri sunwaayee ke vakt thodi-si fursat ke dauraan kaante se ek aam kaa tukdaa uthaate hue ve hameshaa kii tarah mahatvakankshi the
 He told me, "I bet my last shirt to you, Nawaz is about to leave
 '' unamem aatmavishvaas bharaa tha
 Something like this is a streak of stone
 unke vakil naeem bukhari ne unke sur main sur milaayaa, "ve gaye! nishpaksh nyaaypalika ne unhen wicket ke peeche kaich kar liya he! pavilian chor se imran ke haathon bold!''mumkin kii kalakaha jaataa he ki teen baar ke shuhar, chaar baar ke daavedaar or baar-baar paidaa hone vaale sufi imran khan dashakon se piemalen or pipipi ke dabadabe vaali do daleey vyavastha ko tod denge
 When federal investigators have summoned former President and ppp's Asif Zardari last week (in the case of money laundering), when rival Siyasatdan Aaron Billaur (member of Awami National Party) has been killed, when arch rival Nawaz was arrested And is expected to be the largest military contingent ever for military general elections (within an unprecedented 3,71,000 military polling stations and 80,000 outside), in such a situation, even political experts will believe that we will have no choice but to vote for Imran Khan

 odisha doosraa tripura banegaa
 "so, the Chief Minister of Biju Janata Dal (BJD), Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, was bound to reply
 patnayak ne badi shystagi se jawaab diya ki odisha tripura nahin he
 He also said that bjd's performance will be better than before
 darasal 2009 main bijd ke rajg se alag hone ke baad se hi bhaajapa odisha main apni paith badhaane kii koshish kar rahi he, lekin abhi tak use kamyaabi nahin mili he
 In the 2014 Modi wave too, the BJD won 117 out of a total of 147 assembly seats and 20 in 21 Lok Sabha seats
 haalanki panchayat chunaavon main pai kamyaabi or bijd se tuutakar aae netaaon kii vajah se bhaajapa kii ummiden 2019 main ufaan par hai
 In the February 2017 panchayat elections, 306 seats were won out of a total of 853 seats, which is more than eight times more than the 36 seats in 2012
 isi ke maddenjar kendriya petroleum mantri dharmendra pradhan party kaa aadhaar badhaane kii jugat main jute hai
 Since 2018, meetings of Prime Minister Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have increased in Odisha
 is janvari se hi modi vahaan teen baar sabhaayen kar chuke hai
 In contrast, Chief Minister Patnaik, who has been in power for 19 years, faces many challenges
 satta virdohi rujhaan baari he or naveen babu bijd main duusari paant ke netaaon ko aage laane main naakaam rahe hai
 The Lok Sabha and Assembly elections are barely a month away and many party veterans have gone to the BJP
 bijd ke diggaj netaa, do baar rajyasabha tathaa do baar cendrapara se loksabhaa sadsy rahe baijayant pandas, bhadrak se aath baar chunaav jeetne vaale arjuna sethi, navrangpur se saansad rahe balbhadra majhi or kandhamal se loksabhaa sadsy raheen pratyusha rajeshwari singh ne naveen kaa saath chhodkar bhaajapa kii sadsyta le lee
 Not only this, former minister Damodar Raut, Raghunath Mahanti, who is known as Biju Patnaik
 narayanrav, tushaarakanti nayak, poornachandra nayak, niranjan pradhan jaise netaa bhi bhaajapa main chale gaye
 All these are in the fray
 bhaajapa ne iees se svaichhik ritairement lekar raajnneeti main utrin aparajita saarangi ko bhubaneshwar se, party ke rashtriya pravaktaa sambit paatra ko puri se, balbhadra majhi ko navanragpur se, kendriya mantri juel oram ko sundargarh se, baijayant pandas ko cendrapara se or pratap saarangi ko balasore se utaara he
 The BJD has adopted a strategy to cut this challenge in a different way
 party ne loksabhaa chunaav ke liye 33 pratishat mahila ummidavaaron ko utaara he
 In total 21 candidates will be seven women
 yahi nahin, swayan sahaayta samooh (esaechaji) se judi 70 lakh mahilaon kii numaaindgi loksabhaa main pakki karne ke liye aska loksabhaa kshetra se pramila bisoi par daanv lagaaya he
 Then, in Bhubaneswar, bjp's former IAS officer Aparajita Sarangi has fielded Aroop Patnaik, who retired as Mumbai Police Commissioner
 congress ne makapa pratyaashee janardan pati ko samarthan diya he
 In Kendrapada, bjd's Odia films superstar Rajya Sabha member Anubhav Mahanti is compared to Baijayant Panda
 yahaan congress ne dharnidhran nayak par daanv lagaaya he
 Naveen has tried strong fortifications
 paanch rajyasabha sadasyon ko maidan main utaara gaya he
 Achyut Samanta, founder of Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS), has been given ticket from Kandhamal, who has provided free education, hostels to his 27,000 tribal children from KG to PG
 party ne prasann acharya ko bargarh se utaara he
 The BJD is busy with the strategy of winning more and more Lok Sabha seats with forming the government for the fifth time
 naveen khud hinjali or bijapur vidhansabha seat se chunaav maidan main hai
 He had said in the first election meeting that the BJD will play an important role in forming the government at the Center this time
 bhaajapa or congress bhi centre or rajya main sarkaar banane kaa daawa kar rahi hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has held meetings in Koraput and Kalahandi twice in the last one week
 rahul gandhi 24 janvari se ab tak paanch sabhaayen kar chuke hai
 However, it is also being said that bjd's 2014 performance will not be seen in 2019
 yah baat bijd netritv khud mahasoos kar rahaa he
 Perhaps that's why 17 of the 21 seats in the Lok Sabha have been fielded and 44 of the 147 mlas were ticketed
 prachaartantr bhi hytech he
 There is a special focus on tribal seats
 party ke anusaar, 66 nae chehre utaare gaye hai
 In fact, serious allegations like anti-incumbency trends, urban unemployment, agriculture, minimum support price to farmers, people caught in the chit fund scam and ticketing of sons of accused can become an issue in the opposition elections
 isaki kaat ke liye naveen patnayak 10,180 karod ru
 The Kisan Farmers are considering game changer to benefit 32 lakh farmers and 2,40,000 farm laborers through Livelihood Assistance and Income Addition (kalia) scheme
 iske alaava, gramin logon, mahilaon, adivaasiyon or pichde virgon ke liye vibhinn yojanaayen bhi hai
 Patnaik further expects issues like development works and stable government to be effective
 haalanki raajnneeti vishleshak ke mutabik, rajya main bijd kii sarkaar to ban sakati he par siten kam aaengi
 It is estimated to get 80 to 90 seats in the assembly
 yah bhi sambhav he ki bhaajapa mukhya vipakshi dal ke rup main ubhare
 bjp's focus on Odisha can also be understood that since 2018, Modi has addressed 14 public meetings and Amit Shah 12 meetings
 modi ne haal main yahaan dabl ingine kii baat kii, yani rajya or centre, donon main bhaajapa sarkaar ho
 Shah is concerned that the Center for the development of Odisha has 5
 56 lakh karod rupaya diya he lekin yah paisa gaanvon tak kyon nahin pahunchaa? unhone aarope lagaaya ki mukhyamantri ke sangrakshan main naukarshahi haath saaf kar rahi he
 BJP state in-charge general secretary Arun Singh says that Odisha officers are acting like a BJD worker
 congress bhi jor laga rahi he
 Party president Rahul Gandhi has held five meetings in Odisha so far
 haalanki 2014 main mukhya vipakshi dal rahi congress ke bare main kayaas yahi he ki is baar uski loksabhaa siten kuch bhale badhen par vidhansabha main vah number teen kii party ho sakati he
 The party is struggling with infighting
 pradesh adhyaksh niranjan patnayak do vidhansabha kshetron se maidan main hai
 His son is contesting from Balasore Lok Sabha seat
 jo ho, rajya main is baar ladaai dilachasp he
 Political Surmanvin Patnaik Biju Janata Dal (BJD) President, the four-time chief minister faces a tough challenge to repeat his performance for the fifth time
 2014 main kul 21 sansadeey siton main 20 siten jeetne kaa record kaayam kar chuke bijd ke saamne is baar bhaajapa se kadi chunauti mil rahi hadharmendra pradhan odisha main bhaajapa ke chehre, kendriya petroleum mantri par party ko majboot aadhaar dilaane kaa daromadar
 The party fielded broken leaders from the BJD to broaden its base and expect it to perform well
 The challenge of Niranjan Patnaik, the Odisha Congress president, to contain the party's disbanding base and restore its old position in the state
 bijd sarkaar ke khilaaf rujhaan kaa laabh lene ke liye party kaa focus badha
 *** dilli ke up-mukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne buudhvaar ko president estate sthit rajendra prasad skool kaa auchak nirikshan kar vittiya aniyamitata paae jane ke baad skool ke principal ko suspend kar diya
 Sisodia did this surprise inspection after several complaints against the school administration and recovered a large number of fake bills and receipts during the inspection

 This case is actually related to the questions raised by activist Subhash Aggarwal
 agarwal mantralay se rouse avenue sthit rashtriya janata dal ke mukhyalay kaa naam 'rabari bhawan' kiye jane ke bare main jaananaa chaahate the
 Party leader Naval Kishore Rai also objected to this
 agarwal ne is soochna ke liye pehle party se sampark kiya tha lekin jab party ne unhen jaankaree nahin di to unhone mantralay se sampark kiya kyonki uske paas bhi yah soochna maujuud thi
 The ministry said that there is no record indicating that Rai had raised any objection to the issue
 agarwal bihar sarkaar dwaara rajd ko patna yaa kisi anya rajya main aavanton yaa patte par di gai jameen ke bare main bhi mantralay se jaananaa chaahate the
 The Ministry had said in its reply that 'no accommodation has been provided to RJD in New Delhi
 ' ayukta ne kaha ki patna main bhu-aavanton se jude sawaal ko jawaab dene ke liye bihar sarkaar ke paas bheja ja saktaa he jabaki rajd mukhyalay ke namakaran ke mudde ko party ke paas bheja janaa chahie
