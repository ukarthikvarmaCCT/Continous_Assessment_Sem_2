 Immediately after the decision of the Supreme Court, an emergency meeting of Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Cabinet was called on this issue
 baithak main faisla liya gaya ki punjab pani kaa ek bhi boond punjab se baahar jane nahin degaa
 In this emergency led by Prakash Singh Badal, it was decided that an appeal will be made to President Pranab Mukherjee not to accept the Supreme Court's decision on this issue

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The Narendra Modi government and the Jammu and Kashmir government have come face to face regarding Article 370 of the Constitution
 mangalvaar ko padbhaar sanbhaalane vaale piemo main rajya mantri jitendra singh ne kaha ki modi sarkaar jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 370 par charchaa ke liye taiyaar he
 Shortly thereafter, Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah termed Jitendra Singh's statement as irresponsible
 abdulla ne twit kar kaha, 'yaa to jammu kashmir bharat kaa hissaa nahin hoga yaa anuchhed 370 kaa astitv rahegaa
 He said that Kashmir is connected to the rest of India only because of Article 370
 umr ne apane is twit ko surakshit rakhane kii bijepi ko salaah dete hue kaha ki anuchhed 370 waapas lene kii baat na keval jaankaree ke abhaav ke aadhaar par he balki gaiyr jimmedaarana bhi he
 So the new MOS PMO says process / discussions to revoke Art 370 have started
 Wow, that was a quick beginning
 Not sure who is talking 1 / n— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) May 27, 2014mark my words & save this tweet - long after Modi Govt is a distant memory either J&K won't be part of India or Art 370 will still exist 2 / n— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) May 27, 2014art 370 is the ONLY constitutional link between J&K & rest of India
 Talk of revocation of not just ill informed it's irresponsible
 3 / 3 — Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) May 27, 2014 BJP MP Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore reacted to Omar Abdullah's statement
 Like any other issue, it's best for the health of our nation that Article 370 giving special status to J&K be open to public debate
 # India — Rajyavardhan Rathore (@ra_thore) May 27, 2014 Indians have bled enough for J&K to belong to anyone else but India
 Should a debate be struck down by CM J&K by an ultimatum to break away?— Rajyavardhan Rathore (@ra_thore)may 27, 2014isse pehle, jitendra singh ne kaha ki anuchhed 370 par charchaa honi chahie
 However, he also made it clear that through this process those who disagree will be tried to explain
 gauratlab he ki modi ne pichley saal rajya main ek raily ke dauraan anuchhed 370 par charchaa kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 Singh furthering Modi's point, said, "it is his (modi's) and government's wish that we discuss it so that we can explain to the people disagreeing about the harm caused by Article 370
" agar ham charchaa hi nahin karenge to ham un logon ko kaise samajha sakenge ki anuchhed 370 ke chalate ve kin chizon se vanchit rah gaye
 He said that Article 370 is more of a psychological hurdle than a physical one and the Modi government is ready to discuss with all stakeholders, including youths, the benefits and disadvantages of withdrawing it
 pidipi ne bhi kii aalochanajammu-kashmir kii ek or party pidipi ne bhi jitendra singh ke is bayaan kii aalochana kii
 PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti said, 'the Prime Minister is urged to keep Article 370 on such voices
 yah durbhagyapurna hai ki jammu-kashmir se taalluk rakhane vaale mantri ne kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke pehle din hi is tarah kii tippanee kii
 However, in the wake of the uproar, Jitendra Singh clarified that his statement on Article 370 was distorted
 unhone kaha, 'maine piem narendra modi ke hawaale se kuch bhi nahin kaha he
 The ruckus on this issue is baseless

 aapane aksar logon ko kehete suna hoga ki subah kaa brakefast acchhee sehat ke liye sabase zyada ahm hota he
 Breakfast has been considered the most important in many studies
 pichhali kai study main bataaya gaya he ki brakefast karne se vajan kam hota he, kyonki subah ke samay zyada calories bern hone se din ke baaki samay bhukh kam lagati he

 balki, study kii report main daawa kiya gaya he ki jo log brakefast karte hai, unamem calories zyada pai jaati he
 Several previous studies reported that breakfast was essential to keep weight under control
 lekin shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki wo sabhi study objarveshnal thim, jo kisi vyakti kii healdi lifestil ko darshaati hai

 Researchers said that different studies have yielded different results
 lekin study ke sah lekhak, professor flavia ne bataaya, nai study ke nattejey vajan kam karne ke liye brakefast karne ko saport nahin karte hai
 However, daily breakfast brings many other benefits to health

 Crispy halls started to describe the condition of the college as if it is their number one college in India
 magar kiran ji aisi nahin hai
 He said that there should be 26 professors, lecturers in this college but they are not complete
 sanskrit
 There is no professor in History, Psychology, Political Science
 hindi main ek professor hai jo ritair hone vaali hai
 Many non-teaching seats are vacant
 arase se bahaali nahin hui
 There are no people to clean the college
 960 ke kareeb chaatra hai
 The building is in poor condition, it is a library but not a librarian
 prisimple dow kiran kumari lagaataar vishvavidhyalay ko likh rahi hai lekin koi sunwaayee nahin he
 When the work of the leader is done by getting the idol made and the birth anniversary celebrated, then why keep a professor-teacher to teach in school-college
 isi tarah mamrava kaa ek college he echaar college
 There are only 4 professors, there should be 17
 jaiprakash narayan kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal hamane le liya
 Now we will take the condition of the university built in the memory of Deendalaya Upadhyay
 deen dayaal upaadhyaay uniwarsity, gorakhpur chalate hai
 Gorakhpur University has been functioning since 1957
 pandit esaem treepathi ke prayaason se yah uniwarsity shuru hui thi
 Mahant Digvijaynath also contributed, Yogi Adityanath, the second successor of his tradition, is the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 tasveeron ko dekh kar yahi laga ki gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa campus kaaphi chamakdaar or saaf-suthra he
 The name of Gorakhpur University is Deendayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University
 is campus main 16000 se zyaada chaatr hai
 Every year more than 5000 students take admission here
 uniwarsity ke is campus main teacher kitne aate hai, ham us par aa rahe hai
 365 posts are approved here but 25 posts are empty
 is baar uniwarsity ne bahaali kaa vigyaapan nikaala he, kareeb 212 padon kii bhartiyon nikaleen hai
 Hope the university will get rid of this problem
 magar uniwarsity se jude baaki collejon kaa kya haal he, vahaan kitni bhartiyon honi hai, isaki mukammal jaankaree hamaare paas nahin hai
 We have resorted to the university budget paper for 2016-17 for our report
 yahaan ke chaatr, tarah-tarah kii fees ke zarie is uniwarsity ko kareeb 74 karod rupee dete hai, magar badale main miltaa he khaali class room
 Seeing the budget paper, it is known that there are terrible cuts in many places
 jaise 2014-15 main rasayan shaastra vibhaag kaa vaastavik bajet tha 11 lakh se adhik tha
 But the estimated budget for 2015-16 has been increased to 8 lakhs
 teen lakh kii katautee ho gai he
 The comments kitne saal is uniwarsity main bagair shikshakon ke class chali hogi, un chaatro ke saath kya hua hoga
 When they do not mean to their lives, then how upset we are
 phir bhi gorakhpur uniwarsity ne 1998 se lekar 2003 tak edock par shikshak rakhe
 These are called honorarium teachers
 jo pehle 5000 prati maah kii selary par padhaate the jo baad main badhkar 8000 prati maah ho gaya
 In 2006, the University Executive Council passed a proposal to regularize honorarium teachers till 2004, but that decision did not apply
 2010 main uniwarsity ne 87 maandey shikshakon ko achaanak nikaal diya jabaki ye kam se kam 8 saal or adhik se adhik 15 saal tak padhaa chuke hai
 Now they are on the road
 maandey shikshak association banaakar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 In 2014, Yogi Adityanath also wrote a letter for him as an MP
 ab ve mukhyamantri hai
 Along with honorarium teacher honorarium is also struggling for attention so that someone can pay attention to them
 in adhyayanon ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki bhashaai vishyon kii haalat sabase adhik karaab he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, the leaders make a riot in the city, fight north-south India, but Hindi and Sanskrit departments are running everywhere without professors
 urdu kaa bhi haal inhen ke jaisaa he
 We have been able to get the status of very few universities and colleges in the series we have started in prime time, but it only shows that thousands of professors and lecturers are lying vacant in colleges
 ye vekainsee kai saal se hai
 Somewhere from twenty years to twenty years
 phir bhi koi maang nahin karata he ki naukari he to dekar hamen rojgaar do
 Being a Permanente is a dream of the youth of India, in the name of this dream, the college and university keep them as guest lecturers, adhoc, they give their daily wages and expel them after many years of bluffing
 bharat ke yuvaaon ko kabhi laga hi nahin ki is masale par whats ap uniwarsity main kuch sawaal jawaab kiye jaaen
 The sign of jp's movement may not have survived, but there are many people who have become MP ministers after his name
 lokanayak jaiprakash narayan kaa itihaas azaadi ke andolan ke samay bhi shandaar rahaa he or azaadi ke baad bhi
 There is no sign of the entire revolution which was given by Jayaprakash Narayan during the Emergency
 jepi ke senaanee 5000 se 1 xxrep 4 0 tak pension lene lage hai
 Many leaders came to the government with the name of JP, after coming to the government they did the same against which JP fought
 bhrashtachar unki raajnneeti kaa ahm hissaa he, kisi ke yahaan parivaarwaad ke naam par bhrashtachar he, to kisi ke yahaan vyaktvaad ke naam par
 Everyone recognizes the issues of corruption according to their own opportunities, decides the strategy of speaking and keeping quiet
 jepi kaa andolan awaz uthaane ke saahas kaa ek safal andolan tha, magar aage chalakar apane tamaam lakshyon ko hasil karne main fail rahaa
 Many leaders are successful in the name of this failed movement
 ve khud ko krantikari kii tarah pesh karte hai, jabaki unki raajnneeti sirf or sirf kaala dhan ke aadhaar par hi chamakati he
 It is not a big deal that today many leaders who take the name of Jayaprakash Narayan are Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, Governors
 ek asafal kranti ke itane saare safal nayak
 There is a university in Bihar named after JP
 sampurna kranti ek pita hua naaraa he, isaki misaal he chhapra kii jepi uniwarsity
 When you could not create a quality university in jp's name, then you can understand that our leaders only use jp's name
 1990 main siwan, gopalganj, chhapra zilon ke liye jaiprakash narayan vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui thi
 Even after 27 years, this university does not appear anywhere on the education map of Bihar
 haal hi main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii taraf se jari rashtriya sansthagat ranking fremawork ( NIRF) kii ranking main to iskaa naam bhi nahin he
 In Jaypee University neither Jaypee has anything, nor does University have anything
 1990 main maala mirza tukdaa gaanv kii 240 acre zamin par is uniwarsity kii sthapana kii gai thi
 It is good that there used to be cultivation here
 27 saal baad bhi is uniwarsity kaa buniyadi dhaancha puri tarah viksit nahin hua he
 There are 32 colleges under it in which 47000 students of undergraduate and post graduate study
 47000 chaatro ko yah pataa chal jaae ki ve bagaiyr guru ke liye vishwa guru banane ke jhansa project ke shikaar ho rahe hai to unheen main ek jepi paidaa ho jaae
 There should have been 750 professors, lecturers in this university but there are only 300, out of which 100 have been appointed recently
 450 pad khaali hai
 More than 50 percent of the positions are vacant
 iske paas 17 post graduate vibhaag hai, aamtaur par iske liye alag se bahaali hoti he magar college ke shikshakon se hi piji kii class lene ke liye kaha jaataa he
 University vice-chancellor Professor Harikesh Singh acknowledges that the university is in its silver jubilee year of its establishment and not a single building has been completed yet
 isi uniwarsity kaa ek college he rajendra college chhapra main he
 It is the historical college of Bihar which was established on the 1st of August, 1938
 chhapra ke banavaari laal ji ne agar apana ek bhawan, 20 bigha, 12 kattha or 11 dhur zamin na di hoti to yah college yahaan maujuud na hota
 Even today, this college is running in this building built before 1939
 banavaari laal shah ji kaa bhi apana alag hi itihaas he
 a book from Google search revealed, Communication and Colonialism in Eastern India: Bihar, 1760s-1880s, its author Nitin Sinha wrote that the British government asked the Collector of Saran to organize the court and he received the title of Shah Please provide a note
 banavaari laal ji kii khyaati hi is baat kii thi ki ve dharmashala, sarai ke liye kaaphi dhan-daulat or zamin daan main dete the
 He was a great merchant of Saran at that time and also controlled the trade through the river
 banavaari laal shah chhapra ke katra mohalla main rahete the
 He was not like the present-day Shah who sued for defamation of hundred crores
 shah banavaari laal ji ne kitna kuch daan kar diya, bagaiyr soche ki 21veen sadi kaa hindustan yaad bhi karegaa yaa nahin
 The history of a university or college is not about a class room alone
 wo shahar or uske samaaj kaa bhi itihaas hota he
 Therefore, while talking about Rajendra College Chapra, we started talking about Banwari Lal Shah
 1866 main chhapra nagarpalika kaa gathan ho chukaa tha
 In 1939, the then Municipal vice-president, Hariharsharan Ji, Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par college kholaa, tab rajendra prasad bharat ke pratham raashtrapati nahin bane the, bharat kii azaadi aath saal dur thi, lekin dow
 In the name of Rajendra Prasad, how was his Jeetji College formed? yah bhi ek itihaas he
 At that time there was a flood in Bihar and Rajendra Babu became very popular with his relief work
 us kaam ke sammaan main chhapra main rajendra prasad college khulaa
 His elder brother Mahendra Prasad also contributed to the urbanization of Chapra
 ek kahawat he ki mahendra nahin hote to rajend nahin hote
 All this information was given to us by Professor Lal Babu Yadav, Head of the Department of Political Science
 aaj us college main padhaane ke liye 157 professor-lekturer chahie, magar 33 prophessoron ke dam par hi college chal rahaa he
 There is no one to teach in Chemistry, Sanskrit, Urdu
 bhugol, hindi, commers main sirf ek-ek shikshak hai
 5000 students study in this college
 do saal se sarkaar ne is college ko paisa nahin diya he
 The government has not given its share in lieu of non-payment of fees
 rajend college chhapra se rahul sankrutyaayan kaa naam bhi judaa he
 The great Hindi litterateur Shiva Pujan Sahay used to teach here
 purv mukhyamantri daaroga prasad raay yaheen ke chaatr the
 BJP MP from Maharajganj Janardan Sigriwal was a student of this place
 bhikhaari thakur ko saamne laane vaale manoranjan sinha isi college ke praachaarya the
 But now there is no one to teach in this college
 padhai kaa na naam he na namonishaan he
 There are 150 computers but there is only one computer operator to run them
 1941 kaa he diavi college siwan
 This college was built by the late Baidyanath Prasad Ji
 aaj yahaan 12,000 chaatro ko padhaane ke liye maatr 27 professor-lekturer hai
 a teacher weighs 444 students
 botni, bhugol, sanskrit main koi professor nahin hai
 Only 57 posts are approved, out of which 30 posts are vacant
 bataaya gaya ki 18 professor jo ritair hue hai, unhen hi kabhi-kabhaar bula liya jaataa he, jiskaa paisa bhi nahin diya jaataa, magar ve aate hai or padhaa jate hai
 Ram knows what the education minister of Bihar does yahaan mahavidhyalay main vigyaan main thode bahut upkaran hai, anyathaa bina lab ke class chalaa rahe hai
 It is not only harmful but also a crime
 hamane jitne bhi vaais chancelar se baat kii he, koi to mila jo eemaandaaree se apni vyathaa kah rahaa he
 It is telling that degrees are being given without lab
 ye hanikaarak hi nahin aparaadh bhi he
 Someone will ask their leaders what they left out when they were not going to teach our children
 kya yahi kaaran he ki aaj uniwarsity se zyaada whats ap uniwarsity lokapriy he, professor se zyaada chaatr yaa yuva netaaon ke propeganda ko itihaas or vigyaan maan kar sweekaar kar rahe hai
 JP was born on October 11, but the death was on October 8, so between 8 and 11 October, programs are being conducted in this university about JP
 iske liye alag se bajet nahin aayaa he
 But every kind of competition is happening
 jepi ko yaad karne ke liye in chaatro ne kitni mehnat kii hogi, magar jinhen jepi ke naam par raaj mila he, unhone is uniwarsity ke liye kitni mehnat kii he
 Debate, essay writing competition is being organized
 yahi nahin jepi kii yaad main college main rojgaar mela bhi laga hua tha
 Make them unemployable without a professor and then organize employment fair among them
 jisaki ek tasviir se pataa chalata he ki isamen surakshakarmiyon yani security guard kii bahaali ke liye vishesh bhartee abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 Meaning what could be a better example of dusting
 2013-16 kaa batch 2017 tak khatm nahin ho paaya he
 That is, the session is late
 2015 main second year kii pariksha honi thi, 2017 ke june main hui he
 The first year examination of the 2014-17 batch should have been held in 2015, 2017 has been held in June and the result is yet to come
 2015-18 or 2-16-19 batch kaa imtahaan kab hoga, kisi ko pataa nahin
 Why are these sessions late in university
 isliye hote hai taaki berojgaaron ko kuch saal vahiin campus main roak kar rakho
 Bihar's Education Minister should get a patent on how the session is late
 chhapra ke ramajaypal college ke itihaas vibhaag main paanch saal se ek bhi teacher nahin he
 Think what history these students must have read without a teacher for five years
 aajkal netaa subah-subah jayanti-punyatithi par yaad karne vaale card twit kar dete hai
 You might also wonder how much they respect their old leaders
 haal aap apni ankhon se dekh hi rahe hai
 The leader remembers for the vote
 1972 main gopalganj main mahila vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui
 Like the Vice Chancellor of JP University, the principal here also said that speak with my name
 ham kiran ji kii is himmat kaa ehtaraam karte hai
 Many principals started shivering as soon as the phone ran out, hiding their good name
 khasta haal college kaa haal bhi aise bataane lage jaise bharat kaa number ek college unheen kaa ho
 But Kiran ji is not like this
 unhone bataaya ki is college main 26 professor, lekturer hone chahie magar puure nahin hai
 Sanskrit
 itihaas, manovigyaan, raajnneeti vigyaan main koi professor nahin he
 There is a professor in Hindi who is about to retire
 non teaching kii bahut sari siten khaali hai
 There was no restoration for a long time
 college kii saaf-safai karne ke liye bhi log nahin hai
 There are around 960 students
 bhawan kii haalat kharaab he, pustkaalay he lekin librrarian nahin he
 Principal Dr
 Kiran Kumari is continuously writing to the university but there is no hearing
 jab netaa kaa kaam murti banavaakar, jayanti manavaa kar chal hi jaataa he to skool-college main padhaane ke liye professor-teacher kyon rakhen
 Similarly, HR College is a college in Marawa
 yahaan maatr 4 professor hai, hone chahie 17
 We took the hall of the university built in memory of Jayaprakash Narayan
 ab ham dindalai upaadhyaay kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal lenge
 Deen Dayal Upadhyay University, Gorakhpur
 1957 se gorakhpur uniwarsity chal rahi he
 This university was started with the efforts of Pandit SM Tripathi
 manhat digvijaynath kaa bhi yogadan tha, unheen kii parampara ke duusare uttaradhikari yogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri hai
 Looking at the photos, it seemed that the campus of Gorakhpur University is very bright and clean
 gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa naam dinadayal upaadhyaay gorakhpur uniwarsity he
 This campus has more than 16000 students
 har saal yahaan 5000 se adhik chaatr admician lete hai
 How many teachers come to this university campus, we are coming to that
 365 pad yahaan manzur hai magar 25 pad khaali hai
 This time the university has advertised for reinstatement, recruitment for about 212 posts has been released
 ummid he uniwarsity is samasya se mukti paa legi
 But what is the condition of the rest of the colleges associated with the university, we do not have complete information about how many recruitments have to be made there
 hamane apni report ke liye 2016-17 ke liye uniwarsity ke bajet patr kaa sahaara liya he
 Students here pay about 74 crores rupees to this university through various fees, but in return they get an empty class room
 bajet patr dekh kar pataa chal rahaa he ki kai jagahon par bhayankar katautee he
 Like the actual budget of the chemistry department in 2014-15 was more than 11 lakhs
 magar 2015-16 kaa anumaanit bajet 8 lakh kar diya gaya he
 Three lakhs have been deducted
 tippaniyan For how many years this university would have gone without teachers, what would have happened to those students
 unhen hi jab apni zindagi se matlab nahin to ham kitna pareshaan ho
 Nevertheless, Gorakhpur University hired adhoc from 1998 to 2003
 inhen maandey shikshak kaha jaataa he
 Those who previously taught at a salary of 5000 per month, which later increased to 8000 per month
 2006 main uniwarsity kii kaaryaparishad ne 2004 tak maandey par rakhe gaye shikshakon ko niyamit karne kaa prastaav paas kiya magar wo faisla lagu nahin hua
 In 2010, the university suddenly fired 87 honorarium teachers, who have taught for at least 8 years and for more than 15 years
 ab ye sadak par hai
 Honorary teachers are struggling by forming associations
 2014 main saansad ke taur par yogi adityanath ne inke liye patr bhi likhaa tha
 Now he is the Chief Minister
 maandey shikshak associesan maandey ke saath-saath dhyandey ke liye bhi sangharsh kar rahaa he taaki koi to inaki taraf dhyaan de
 During these studies it was found that the condition of linguistic subjects is worst
 hindi or sanskrit ke naam par netaa log shahar main danga kara den, uttar-dakshin bharat ko bhida den magar jagah-jagah hindi or sanskrit vibhaag bagair prophessoron ke chal rahe hai
 Urdu is also similar to these
 jepi ke andolan kii nishaani bhale na bachi ho magar unka naam lekar saansad mantri banane vaale bahut log bache hai
 The history of Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan has been brilliant even during the independence movement and even after independence
 apatkaal ke dauraan jaiprakash narayan ne jis sampurna kranti kaa naaraa diya tha, ab uski koi nishaani nahin bachi he
 jp's fighters have started taking pension from 5000 to 10,000
 jepi kaa naam lekar kai netaaon kii sarkaar ain, sarkaar main aakar unhone bhi vahi kiya jiske kilaaf jepi lade
 Corruption is an important part of their politics, some have corruption in the name of familyism, and in the name of individualism
 sab apane-apane avasaron ke hisaab se bhrashtachar ke muddon ko pahachaanate hai, bolne or chup rahane kii ranneeti tay karte hai
 jp's movement was a successful movement of courage to raise voice, but later failed to achieve all his goals
 is fail andolan kaa naam lekar kai netaa safal hai
 They present themselves as revolutionaries, while their politics shines only on the basis of black money
 yah bhi kam badi baat nahin ki jaiprakash narayan kaa naam lene vaaleaj kai netaa mukhyamantri hai, kendriya mantri hai, rajyapal hai
 So many successful heroes of a failed revolution
 jepi ke naam par ek uniwarsity he bihar main
 Sampoorna Kranti is a slogan, Jaypee University of Chapra
 jab jepi ke naam par ek dhang kii uniwarsity nahin bana sake to aap samaj sakate hai ki hamaare netaa jepi ke naam kaa istamaal hi karte hai
 Jayaprakash Narayan University was established in 1990 for Siwan, Gopalganj, Chapra districts
 27 saal baad bhi yah vishvavidhyalay bihar kii shiksha ke nakshe par kahin nazar nahin aata he
 It is not even named in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking recently released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development
 jepi uniwarsity main na to jepi kaa kuch he, na uniwarsity kaa kuch he
 The university was established in 1990 on 240 acres of land in Mala Mirza Piece village
 isse to acha ki yahaan par kheti hi hoti rahati
 Even after 27 years, the infrastructure of this university is not fully developed
 iske antargat 32 kalege aate hai jisamen under graduate or post graduate ke 47000 chaatr padhate hai
 47000 students come to know that if they are falling prey to the Jhansa project of making Vishwa Guru for Guru, then a JP is born in them
 is uniwarsity main 750 professor, lekturer hone chahie the magar hai sirf 300, jisamen se 100 haal-philhal main niyukt hue hai
 450 posts are empty
 50 fisadi se zyaada pad khaali hai
 It has 17 post graduate departments, usually a separate restoration for it, but college teachers are asked to take PG classes only
 uniwarsity ke kulapati professor harikesh singh sweekaar karte hai ki uniwarsity apni sthapana ke rajat jayanti varsh main he or abhi tak ek bhi imaarat puri banakar taiyaar nahin hui he
 There is a college of this university, Rajendra College is in Chapra
 yah bihar kaa aitihaasik college he jise 1 agast, 1938 ke din sthapit kiya gaya tha
 If Banwari Lalji of Chhapra had not given a building, 20 bighas, 12 katthas and 11 dhur of land, this college would not have existed here
 aaj bhi yah college 1939 ke pehle bane is bhawan main chal rahaa he
 Banwari Lal Shah ji also has his own history
 google search se ek kitaab kaa pataa chalaa, Communication and Colonialism in Eastern India: Bihar, 1760s-1880s, iske lekhak nitin sinha ne likhaa he ki british sarkaar ne saaran ke colector ko kaha gaya ki darbar kaa aayojan karen or unhen shah kii oopaadhi kaa sanad pradaan karen
 It was the fame of Banwari Lal ji that he used to donate a lot of wealth and land for Dharamshala, Sarai
 ve us samay saaran ke bade vyapaaree the or nadi ke raste hone vaale vyapaar ko bhi control karte the
 Banwari Lal Shah lived in Katra Mohalla of Chapra
 ve aajkal vaale shah kii tarah nahin the jo sau karod kii manahani kaa mukadmaa kar dete hai
 Shah Banwari Lal ji donated so much, without thinking whether 21st century India will remember it or not
 vishvavidhyalay yaa college kaa itihaas akele class room kaa nahin hota he
 It also has a history of the city and its society
 isliye ham rajendra college chhapra kii baat karte-karte banavaari laal shah ji ke bare main baat karne lage
 The Chhapra Municipality was formed in 1866
 1939 main tatkaaleen nagarpalika ke upaadhyaksh hariharsharan ji ne dow
 The college opened in the name of Rajendra Prasad, when Rajendra Prasad did not become the first President of India, India's independence was eight years away, but Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par unke jiiteji college kaise bana
 It is also a history
 us vakt bihar main baadh ai thi or rajendra babu apane raahat ke kaam se kaaphi lokapriy ho gaye
 In honor of that work, Rajendra Prasad College opened in Chapra
 unke bade bhai mahendra prasad kaa bhi chhapra ke shaharikaran main yogadan tha
 There is a saying that if Mahendra were not there, Rajendra would not have been there
 yah sab jaankaree political science vibhaag ke pramukh professor laal babu yadav ne hamen di
 Today, 157 professors and lecturers are required to teach in that college, but the college is running on the strength of 33 professors
 chemistry, sanskrit, urdu main to koi padhaane vaala hi nahin he
 There are only one teacher each in Geography, Hindi, Commerce
 is college main 5000 chaatr padhate hai
 For two years, the government has not given money to this college
 fees nahin lene ke evaz main sarkaar ne apana hissaa nahin diya he
 The name of Rahul Sankrityayan is also associated with Rajendra College Chhapra
 hindi ke mahaan sahityakar shiv pujan sahay ji yaheen padhaate the
 Former Chief Minister Daroga Prasad Rai was a student of this place
 maharajaganj se bhaajapa saansad janardan sigrival yaheen ke chaatr the
 Manoranjan Sinha, who brought the beggar Thakur to the fore, was the principal of this college
 magar ab is college main padhaane vaala nahin he
 There is no name of study nor nomination
 150 computer hai lekin unhen chalaane ke liye computer oparator maatr ek he
 DAV College Siwan is 1941
 swargeey baidhnath prasad ji ne is college ko banwaaya tha
 Today there are only 27 professor-lecturers to teach 12,000 students
 ek shikshak par 444 chaatro kaa bhaar aata he
 There are no professors in Botany, Geography, Sanskrit
 57 pad hi manzur hai jisamen se 30 pad khaali hai
 It was told that the 18 professors who have retired, they are called only occasionally, whose money is not given, but they come and study
 bihar ke shiksha mantri kaam kya karte hai, ram jane
 There are few tools in science here in college, otherwise running classes without lab
 yah sirf hanikaarak nahin aparaadh bhi he
 All the Vice Chancellors we have talked to have met someone who is honestly saying his agony
 bataa rahaa he ki bina prayogshaala ke digriyaan di ja rahi hai
 This is not only harmful but also a crime
 koi apane netaaon se poochhega ki hamaare bacchon ko jab padhaane vaale nahin the, wo kya padhakar nikle
 Is this the reason that whats app university is more popular than university today, more students than professors or young leaders are accepting propaganda as history and science
 jepi kaa janm 11 aktubar ke din hua tha, magar maut 8 aktubar ko hui thi, isliye 8 se 11 oktober ke bich jepi ko lekar is uniwarsity main kaarykram kiye ja rahe hai
 There is no separate budget for this
 magar har tarah kii pratiyogita ho rahi he
 How hard these students must have worked to remember JP, but those who have got secret in jp's name, how hard they have worked for this university
 vaad-vivaad, niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 Not only this, there was also an employment fair in the college in memory of JP
 bina professor ke inhen berojgaar hone laayak banaao or phir unke bich rojgaar mela bhi lagaao
 a picture of which shows that there is a special recruitment drive for the reinstatement of security guards
 matlab dhul jhonkne kaa isse acha udhaaharan kya ho saktaa he
 The 2013–16 batch is not finished until 2017
 yani seshan let he
 Second year examination was to be held in 2015, held in June 2017
 2014-17 batch ke pratham varsh kii pariksha 2015 main ho jaani chahie thi, 2017 june main hui he or abhi tak riselt nahin aayaa he
 No one knows when the test for 2015-18 and 2-16-19 batch will take place
 uniwarsity main ye seshan let kyon hote hai
 This is so that they keep the unemployed in the campus for a few years
 seshan let kaise hota he iskaa patent bihar ke shiksha mantri ko kara lenaa chahie
 There is not a single teacher in the history department of Ramjaypal College, Chapra for five years
 sochie, paanch saal tak bagair teacher ke in chaatro ne kya itihaas padhaa hoga
 Nowadays, leaders tweet memorizing cards in the early morning on the death anniversary
 aap bhi sochate honge ki ye apane puraane netaaon kaa kitna sammaan karte hai
 You are only seeing with your eyes
 netaa vot ke liye yaad karte hai
 In 1972, the Women's University was established in Gopalganj
 jepi uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar kii tarah yahaan kii principal ne bhi kaha ki meraa naam lekar bolie
 We appreciate Kiran Ji's courage
 bahut se principal to phone jate hi kaanpane lage, apana acha khaasaa naam chhipaane lage
 Crispy halls started to describe the condition of the college as if it is their number one college in India
 magar kiran ji aisi nahin hai
 He said that there should be 26 professors, lecturers in this college but they are not complete
 sanskrit
 There is no professor in History, Psychology, Political Science
 hindi main ek professor hai jo ritair hone vaali hai
 Many non-teaching seats are vacant
 arase se bahaali nahin hui
 There are no people to clean the college
 960 ke kareeb chaatra hai
 The building is in poor condition, it is a library but not a librarian
 prisimple dow kiran kumari lagaataar vishvavidhyalay ko likh rahi hai lekin koi sunwaayee nahin he
 When the work of the leader is done by getting the idol made and the birth anniversary celebrated, then why keep a professor-teacher to teach in school-college
 isi tarah mamrava kaa ek college he echaar college
 There are only 4 professors, there should be 17
 jaiprakash narayan kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal hamane le liya
 Now we will take the condition of the university built in the memory of Deendalaya Upadhyay
 deen dayaal upaadhyaay uniwarsity, gorakhpur chalate hai
 Gorakhpur University has been functioning since 1957
this university was started with pandit esaem treepathi ke prayaason se yah uniwarsity shuru hui thi
 Mahant Digvijaynath also contributed, Yogi Adityanath, the second successor of his tradition, is the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 tasveeron ko dekh kar yahi laga ki gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa campus kaaphi chamakdaar or saaf-suthra he
 The name of Gorakhpur University is Deendayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University
 is campus main 16000 se zyaada chaatr hai
 Every year more than 5000 students take admission here
 uniwarsity ke is campus main teacher kitne aate hai, ham us par aa rahe hai
 365 posts are approved here but 25 posts are empty
 is baar uniwarsity ne bahaali kaa vigyaapan nikaala he, kareeb 212 padon kii bhartiyon nikaleen hai
 Hope the university will get rid of this problem
 magar uniwarsity se jude baaki collejon kaa kya haal he, vahaan kitni bhartiyon honi hai, isaki mukammal jaankaree hamaare paas nahin hai
 We have resorted to the university budget paper for 2016-17 for our report
 yahaan ke chaatr, tarah-tarah kii fees ke zarie is uniwarsity ko kareeb 74 karod rupee dete hai, magar badale main miltaa he khaali class room
 Seeing the budget paper, it is known that there are terrible cuts in many places
 jaise 2014-15 main rasayan shaastra vibhaag kaa vaastavik bajet tha 11 lakh se adhik tha
 But the estimated budget for 2015-16 has been increased to 8 lakhs
 teen lakh kii katautee ho gai he
 The comments kitne saal is uniwarsity main bagair shikshakon ke class chali hogi, un chaatro ke saath kya hua hoga
 When they do not mean to their lives, then how upset we are
 phir bhi gorakhpur uniwarsity ne 1998 se lekar 2003 tak edock par shikshak rakhe
 These are called honorarium teachers
 jo pehle 5000 prati maah kii selary par padhaate the jo baad main badhkar 8000 prati maah ho gaya
 In 2006, the University Executive Council passed a proposal to regularize honorarium teachers till 2004, but that decision did not apply
 2010 main uniwarsity ne 87 maandey shikshakon ko achaanak nikaal diya jabaki ye kam se kam 8 saal or adhik se adhik 15 saal tak padhaa chuke hai
 Now they are on the road
 maandey shikshak association banaakar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 In 2014, Yogi Adityanath also wrote a letter for him as an MP
 ab ve mukhyamantri hai
 Along with honorarium teacher honorarium is also struggling for attention so that someone can pay attention to them
 in adhyayanon ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki bhashaai vishyon kii haalat sabase adhik karaab he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, the leaders make a riot in the city, fight north-south India, but Hindi and Sanskrit departments are running everywhere without professors
 urdu kaa bhi haal inhen ke jaisaa he
 It is not a big deal that today many leaders who take the name of Jayaprakash Narayan are Chief Ministers, Union Ministers, Governors
 ek asafal kranti ke itane saare safal nayak
 There is a university in Bihar named after JP
 sampurna kranti ek pita hua naaraa he, isaki misaal he chhapra kii jepi uniwarsity
 When you could not create a quality university in jp's name, then you can understand that our leaders only use jp's name
 1990 main siwan, gopalganj, chhapra zilon ke liye jaiprakash narayan vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui thi
 Even after 27 years, this university does not appear anywhere on the education map of Bihar
 haal hi main maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay kii taraf se jari rashtriya sansthagat ranking fremawork ( NIRF) kii ranking main to iskaa naam bhi nahin he
 In Jaypee University neither Jaypee has anything, nor does University have anything
 1990 main maala mirza tukdaa gaanv kii 240 acre zamin par is uniwarsity kii sthapana kii gai thi
 It is good that there used to be cultivation here
 27 saal baad bhi is uniwarsity kaa buniyadi dhaancha puri tarah viksit nahin hua he
 There are 32 colleges under it in which 47000 students of undergraduate and post graduate study
 47000 chaatro ko yah pataa chal jaae ki ve bagaiyr guru ke liye vishwa guru banane ke jhansa project ke shikaar ho rahe hai to unheen main ek jepi paidaa ho jaae
 There should have been 750 professors, lecturers in this university but there are only 300, out of which 100 have been appointed recently
 450 pad khaali hai
 More than 50 percent of the positions are vacant
 iske paas 17 post graduate vibhaag hai, aamtaur par iske liye alag se bahaali hoti he magar college ke shikshakon se hi piji kii class lene ke liye kaha jaataa he
 University vice-chancellor Professor Harikesh Singh acknowledges that the university is in its silver jubilee year of its establishment and not a single building has been completed yet
 isi uniwarsity kaa ek college he rajendra college chhapra main he
 It is the historical college of Bihar which was established on the 1st of August, 1938
 chhapra ke banavaari laal ji ne agar apana ek bhawan, 20 bigha, 12 kattha or 11 dhur zamin na di hoti to yah college yahaan maujuud na hota
 Even today, this college is running in this building built before 1939
 banavaari laal shah ji kaa bhi apana alag hi itihaas he
 a book from Google search revealed, Communication and Colonialism in Eastern India: Bihar, 1760s-1880s, its author Nitin Sinha wrote that the British government asked the Collector of Saran to organize the court and he received the title of Shah Please provide a note
 banavaari laal ji kii khyaati hi is baat kii thi ki ve dharmashala, sarai ke liye kaaphi dhan-daulat or zamin daan main dete the
 He was a great merchant of Saran at that time and also controlled the trade through the river
 banavaari laal shah chhapra ke katra mohalla main rahete the
 He was not like the present-day Shah who sued for defamation of hundred crores
 shah banavaari laal ji ne kitna kuch daan kar diya, bagaiyr soche ki 21veen sadi kaa hindustan yaad bhi karegaa yaa nahin
 The history of a university or college is not about a class room alone
 wo shahar or uske samaaj kaa bhi itihaas hota he
 Therefore, while talking about Rajendra College Chapra, we started talking about Banwari Lal Shah
 1866 main chhapra nagarpalika kaa gathan ho chukaa tha
 In 1939, the then Municipal vice-president, Hariharsharan Ji, Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par college kholaa, tab rajendra prasad bharat ke pratham raashtrapati nahin bane the, bharat kii azaadi aath saal dur thi, lekin dow
 In the name of Rajendra Prasad, how was his Jeetji College formed? yah bhi ek itihaas he
 At that time there was a flood in Bihar and Rajendra Babu became very popular with his relief work
 us kaam ke sammaan main chhapra main rajendra prasad college khulaa
 His elder brother Mahendra Prasad also contributed to the urbanization of Chapra
 ek kahawat he ki mahendra nahin hote to rajend nahin hote
 All this information was given to us by Professor Lal Babu Yadav, Head of the Department of Political Science
 aaj us college main padhaane ke liye 157 professor-lekturer chahie, magar 33 prophessoron ke dam par hi college chal rahaa he
 There is no one to teach in Chemistry, Sanskrit, Urdu
 bhugol, hindi, commers main sirf ek-ek shikshak hai
 5000 students study in this college
 do saal se sarkaar ne is college ko paisa nahin diya he
 The government has not given its share in lieu of non-payment of fees
 rajend college chhapra se rahul sankrutyaayan kaa naam bhi judaa he
 The great Hindi litterateur Shiva Pujan Sahay used to teach here
 purv mukhyamantri daaroga prasad raay yaheen ke chaatr the
 BJP MP from Maharajganj Janardan Sigriwal was a student of this place
 bhikhaari thakur ko saamne laane vaale manoranjan sinha isi college ke praachaarya the
 But now there is no one to teach in this college
 padhai kaa na naam he na namonishaan he
 There are 150 computers but there is only one computer operator to run them
 1941 kaa he diavi college siwan
 This college was built by the late Baidyanath Prasad Ji
 aaj yahaan 12,000 chaatro ko padhaane ke liye maatr 27 professor-lekturer hai
 a teacher weighs 444 students
 botni, bhugol, sanskrit main koi professor nahin hai
 Only 57 posts are approved, out of which 30 posts are vacant
 bataaya gaya ki 18 professor jo ritair hue hai, unhen hi kabhi-kabhaar bula liya jaataa he, jiskaa paisa bhi nahin diya jaataa, magar ve aate hai or padhaa jate hai
 Ram knows what the education minister of Bihar does yahaan mahavidhyalay main vigyaan main thode bahut upkaran hai, anyathaa bina lab ke class chalaa rahe hai
 It is not only harmful but also a crime
 hamane jitne bhi vaais chancelar se baat kii he, koi to mila jo eemaandaaree se apni vyathaa kah rahaa he
 It is telling that degrees are being given without lab
 ye hanikaarak hi nahin aparaadh bhi he
 Someone will ask their leaders what they left out when they were not going to teach our children
 kya yahi kaaran he ki aaj uniwarsity se zyaada whats ap uniwarsity lokapriy he, professor se zyaada chaatr yaa yuva netaaon ke propeganda ko itihaas or vigyaan maan kar sweekaar kar rahe hai
 JP was born on October 11, but the death was on October 8, so between 8 and 11 October, programs are being conducted in this university about JP
 iske liye alag se bajet nahin aayaa he
 But every kind of competition is happening
 jepi ko yaad karne ke liye in chaatro ne kitni mehnat kii hogi, magar jinhen jepi ke naam par raaj mila he, unhone is uniwarsity ke liye kitni mehnat kii he
 Debate, essay writing competition is being organized
 yahi nahin jepi kii yaad main college main rojgaar mela bhi laga hua tha
 Make them unemployable without a professor and then organize employment fair among them
 jisaki ek tasviir se pataa chalata he ki isamen surakshakarmiyon yani security guard kii bahaali ke liye vishesh bhartee abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 Meaning what could be a better example of dusting
 2013-16 kaa batch 2017 tak khatm nahin ho paaya he
 That is, the session is late
 2015 main second year kii pariksha honi thi, 2017 ke june main hui he
 The first year examination of the 2014-17 batch should have been held in 2015, 2017 has been held in June and the result is yet to come
 2015-18 or 2-16-19 batch kaa imtahaan kab hoga, kisi ko pataa nahin
 Why are these sessions late in university
 isliye hote hai taaki berojgaaron ko kuch saal vahiin campus main roak kar rakho
 Bihar's Education Minister should get a patent on how the session is late
 chhapra ke ramajaypal college ke itihaas vibhaag main paanch saal se ek bhi teacher nahin he
 Think what history these students must have read without a teacher for five years
 aajkal netaa subah-subah jayanti-punyatithi par yaad karne vaale card twit kar dete hai
 You might also wonder how much they respect their old leaders
 haal aap apni ankhon se dekh hi rahe hai
 The leader remembers for the vote
 1972 main gopalganj main mahila vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui
 Like the Vice Chancellor of JP University, the principal here also said that speak with my name
 ham kiran ji kii is himmat kaa ehtaraam karte hai
 Many principals started shivering as soon as the phone ran out, hiding their good name
 khasta haal college kaa haal bhi aise bataane lage jaise bharat kaa number ek college unheen kaa ho
 But Kiran ji is not like this
 unhone bataaya ki is college main 26 professor, lekturer hone chahie magar puure nahin hai
 Sanskrit
 itihaas, manovigyaan, raajnneeti vigyaan main koi professor nahin he
 There is a professor in Hindi who is about to retire
 non teaching kii bahut sari siten khaali hai
 There was no restoration for a long time
 college kii saaf-safai karne ke liye bhi log nahin hai
 There are around 960 students
 bhawan kii haalat kharaab he, pustkaalay he lekin librrarian nahin he
 Principal Dr
 Kiran Kumari is continuously writing to the university but there is no hearing
 jab netaa kaa kaam murti banavaakar, jayanti manavaa kar chal hi jaataa he to skool-college main padhaane ke liye professor-teacher kyon rakhen
 Similarly, HR College is a college in Marawa
 yahaan maatr 4 professor hai, hone chahie 17
 We took the hall of the university built in memory of Jayaprakash Narayan
 ab ham dindalai upaadhyaay kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal lenge
 Deen Dayal Upadhyay University, Gorakhpur
 1957 se gorakhpur uniwarsity chal rahi he
 This university was started with the efforts of Pandit SM Tripathi
 manhat digvijaynath kaa bhi yogadan tha, unheen kii parampara ke duusare uttaradhikari yogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri hai

 How many teachers come to this university campus, we are coming to that
 365 pad yahaan manzur hai magar 25 pad khaali hai
 This time the university has advertised for reinstatement, recruitment for about 212 posts has been released
 ummid he uniwarsity is samasya se mukti paa legi
 But what is the condition of the rest of the colleges associated with the university, we do not have complete information about how many recruitments have to be made there
 hamane apni report ke liye 2016-17 ke liye uniwarsity ke bajet patr kaa sahaara liya he
 Students here pay about 74 crores rupees to this university through various fees, but in return they get an empty class room
 bajet patr dekh kar pataa chal rahaa he ki kai jagahon par bhayankar katautee he
 Like the actual budget of the chemistry department in 2014-15 was more than 11 lakhs
 magar 2015-16 kaa anumaanit bajet 8 lakh kar diya gaya he
 Three lakhs have been deducted
 tippaniyan For how many years this university would have gone without teachers, what would have happened to those students
 unhen hi jab apni zindagi se matlab nahin to ham kitna pareshaan ho
 Nevertheless, Gorakhpur University hired adhoc from 1998 to 2003

 2006 main uniwarsity kii kaaryaparishad ne 2004 tak maandey par rakhe gaye shikshakon ko niyamit karne kaa prastaav paas kiya magar wo faisla lagu nahin hua
 In 2010, the university suddenly fired 87 honorarium teachers, who have taught for at least 8 years and for more than 15 years

 If Banwari Lalji of Chhapra had not given a building, 20 bighas, 12 katthas and 11 dhur of land, this college would not have existed here
 aaj bhi yah college 1939 ke pehle bane is bhawan main chal rahaa he
 Banwari Lal Shah ji also has his own history
 google search se ek kitaab kaa pataa chalaa, Communication and Colonialism in Eastern India: Bihar, 1760s-1880s, iske lekhak nitin sinha ne likhaa he ki british sarkaar ne saaran ke colector ko kaha gaya ki darbar kaa aayojan karen or unhen shah kii oopaadhi kaa sanad pradaan karen
 It was the fame of Banwari Lal ji that he used to donate a lot of wealth and land for Dharamshala, Sarai
 ve us samay saaran ke bade vyapaaree the or nadi ke raste hone vaale vyapaar ko bhi control karte the
 Banwari Lal Shah lived in Katra Mohalla of Chapra
 ve aajkal vaale shah kii tarah nahin the jo sau karod kii manahani kaa mukadmaa kar dete hai
 Shah Banwari Lal ji donated so much, without thinking whether 21st century India will remember it or not
 vishvavidhyalay yaa college kaa itihaas akele class room kaa nahin hota he
 It also has a history of the city and its society
 isliye ham rajendra college chhapra kii baat karte-karte banavaari laal shah ji ke bare main baat karne lage
 The Chhapra Municipality was formed in 1866
 1939 main tatkaaleen nagarpalika ke upaadhyaksh hariharsharan ji ne dow
 The college opened in the name of Rajendra Prasad, when Rajendra Prasad did not become the first President of India, India's independence was eight years away, but Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par unke jiiteji college kaise bana
 It is also a history
 us vakt bihar main baadh ai thi or rajendra babu apane raahat ke kaam se kaaphi lokapriy ho gaye
 In honor of that work, Rajendra Prasad College opened in Chapra
 unke bade bhai mahendra prasad kaa bhi chhapra ke shaharikaran main yogadan tha
 There is a saying that if Mahendra were not there, Rajendra would not have been there
 yah sab jaankaree political science vibhaag ke pramukh professor laal babu yadav ne hamen di
 Today, 157 professors and lecturers are required to teach in that college, but the college is running on the strength of 33 professors
 chemistry, sanskrit, urdu main to koi padhaane vaala hi nahin he
 There are only one teacher each in Geography, Hindi, Commerce
 is college main 5000 chaatr padhate hai
 For two years, the government has not given money to this college
 fees nahin lene ke evaz main sarkaar ne apana hissaa nahin diya he
 The name of Rahul Sankrityayan is also associated with Rajendra College Chhapra
 hindi ke mahaan sahityakar shiv pujan sahay ji yaheen padhaate the
 Former Chief Minister Daroga Prasad Rai was a student of this place
 maharajaganj se bhaajapa saansad janardan sigrival yaheen ke chaatr the
 Manoranjan Sinha, who brought the beggar Thakur to the fore, was the principal of this college
 magar ab is college main padhaane vaala nahin he
 There is no name of study nor nomination

 DAV College Siwan is 1941
 swargeey baidhnath prasad ji ne is college ko banwaaya tha
 Today there are only 27 professor-lecturers to teach 12,000 students
 ek shikshak par 444 chaatro kaa bhaar aata he
 There are no professors in Botany, Geography, Sanskrit
 57 pad hi manzur hai jisamen se 30 pad khaali hai
 It was told that the 18 professors who have retired, they are called only occasionally, whose money is not given, but they come and study
 bihar ke shiksha mantri kaam kya karte hai, ram jane
 There are few tools in science here in college, otherwise running classes without lab
 yah sirf hanikaarak nahin aparaadh bhi he
 All the Vice Chancellors we have talked to have met someone who is honestly saying his agony
 bataa rahaa he ki bina prayogshaala ke digriyaan di ja rahi hai
 This is not only harmful but also a crime
 koi apane netaaon se poochhega ki hamaare bacchon ko jab padhaane vaale nahin the, wo kya padhakar nikle
 Is this the reason that whats app university is more popular than university today, more students than professors or young leaders are accepting propaganda as history and science
 jepi kaa janm 11 aktubar ke din hua tha, magar maut 8 aktubar ko hui thi, isliye 8 se 11 oktober ke bich jepi ko lekar is uniwarsity main kaarykram kiye ja rahe hai
 There is no separate budget for this
 magar har tarah kii pratiyogita ho rahi he
 How hard these students must have worked to remember JP, but those who have got secret in jp's name, how hard they have worked for this university
 vaad-vivaad, niabandh lekhan pratiyogita kaa aayojan ho rahaa he
 Not only this, there was also an employment fair in the college in memory of JP
 bina professor ke inhen berojgaar hone laayak banaao or phir unke bich rojgaar mela bhi lagaao
 a picture of which shows that there is a special recruitment drive for the reinstatement of security guards
 matlab dhul jhonkne kaa isse acha udhaaharan kya ho saktaa he
 The 2013–16 batch is not finished until 2017

 Second year examination was to be held in 2015, held in June 2017
 2014-17 batch ke pratham varsh kii pariksha 2015 main ho jaani chahie thi, 2017 june main hui he or abhi tak riselt nahin aayaa he
 No one knows when the test for 2015-18 and 2-16-19 batch will take place
 uniwarsity main ye seshan let kyon hote hai
 This is so that they keep the unemployed in the campus for a few years
 seshan let kaise hota he iskaa patent bihar ke shiksha mantri ko kara lenaa chahie
 There is not a single teacher in the history department of Ramjaypal College, Chapra for five years
 sochie, paanch saal tak bagair teacher ke in chaatro ne kya itihaas padhaa hoga
 Nowadays, leaders tweet memorizing cards in the early morning on the death anniversary
 aap bhi sochate honge ki ye apane puraane netaaon kaa kitna sammaan karte hai
 You are only seeing with your eyes
 netaa vot ke liye yaad karte hai
 In 1972, the Women's University was established in Gopalganj
 jepi uniwarsity ke vaais chancelar kii tarah yahaan kii principal ne bhi kaha ki meraa naam lekar bolie
 We appreciate Kiran Ji's courage
 bahut se principal to phone jate hi kaanpane lage, apana acha khaasaa naam chhipaane lage
 Crispy halls started to describe the condition of the college as if it is their number one college in India
 magar kiran ji aisi nahin hai
 He said that there should be 26 professors, lecturers in this college but they are not complete
 sanskrit
 There is no professor in History, Psychology, Political Science
 hindi main ek professor hai jo ritair hone vaali hai
 Many non-teaching seats are vacant
 arase se bahaali nahin hui
 There are no people to clean the college
 960 ke kareeb chaatra hai
 The building is in poor condition, it is a library but not a librarian
 prisimple dow kiran kumari lagaataar vishvavidhyalay ko likh rahi hai lekin koi sunwaayee nahin he
 When the work of the leader is done by getting the idol made and the birth anniversary celebrated, then why keep a professor-teacher to teach in school-college
 isi tarah mamrava kaa ek college he echaar college
 There are only 4 professors, there should be 17
 jaiprakash narayan kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal hamane le liya
 Now we will take the condition of the university built in the memory of Deendalaya Upadhyay
 deen dayaal upaadhyaay uniwarsity, gorakhpur chalate hai
 Gorakhpur University has been functioning since 1957
 pandit esaem treepathi ke prayaason se yah uniwarsity shuru hui thi
 Mahant Digvijaynath also contributed, Yogi Adityanath, the second successor of his tradition, is the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 tasveeron ko dekh kar yahi laga ki gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa campus kaaphi chamakdaar or saaf-suthra he
 The name of Gorakhpur University is Deendayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University
 is campus main 16000 se zyaada chaatr hai
 Every year more than 5000 students take admission here
 uniwarsity ke is campus main teacher kitne aate hai, ham us par aa rahe hai
 365 posts are approved here but 25 posts are empty
 is baar uniwarsity ne bahaali kaa vigyaapan nikaala he, kareeb 212 padon kii bhartiyon nikaleen hai
 Hope the university will get rid of this problem
 magar uniwarsity se jude baaki collejon kaa kya haal he, vahaan kitni bhartiyon honi hai, isaki mukammal jaankaree hamaare paas nahin hai
 We have resorted to the university budget paper for 2016-17 for our report
 yahaan ke chaatr, tarah-tarah kii fees ke zarie is uniwarsity ko kareeb 74 karod rupee dete hai, magar badale main miltaa he khaali class room
 Seeing the budget paper, it is known that there are terrible cuts in many places
 jaise 2014-15 main rasayan shaastra vibhaag kaa vaastavik bajet tha 11 lakh se adhik tha
 But the estimated budget for 2015-16 has been increased to 8 lakhs
 teen lakh kii katautee ho gai he
 The comments kitne saal is uniwarsity main bagair shikshakon ke class chali hogi, un chaatro ke saath kya hua hoga
 When they do not mean to their lives, then how upset we are
 phir bhi gorakhpur uniwarsity ne 1998 se lekar 2003 tak edock par shikshak rakhe
 These are called honorarium teachers
 jo pehle 5000 prati maah kii selary par padhaate the jo baad main badhkar 8000 prati maah ho gaya
 In 2006, the University Executive Council passed a proposal to regularize honorarium teachers till 2004, but that decision did not apply
 2010 main uniwarsity ne 87 maandey shikshakon ko achaanak nikaal diya jabaki ye kam se kam 8 saal or adhik se adhik 15 saal tak padhaa chuke hai
 Now they are on the road
 maandey shikshak association banaakar sangharsh kar rahe hai
 In 2014, Yogi Adityanath also wrote a letter for him as an MP
 ab ve mukhyamantri hai
 Along with honorarium teacher honorarium is also struggling for attention so that someone can pay attention to them
 in adhyayanon ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki bhashaai vishyon kii haalat sabase adhik karaab he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, the leaders make a riot in the city, fight north-south India, but Hindi and Sanskrit departments are running everywhere without professors

 Along with honorarium teacher honorarium is also struggling for attention so that someone can pay attention to them
 in adhyayanon ke dauraan pataa chalaa ki bhashaai vishyon kii haalat sabase adhik karaab he
 In the name of Hindi and Sanskrit, the leaders make a riot in the city, fight north-south India, but Hindi and Sanskrit departments are running everywhere without professors
 urdu kaa bhi haal inhen ke jaisaa he
 The history of a university or college is not about a class room alone
 wo shahar or uske samaaj kaa bhi itihaas hota he
 Therefore, while talking about Rajendra College Chapra, we started talking about Banwari Lal Shah
 1866 main chhapra nagarpalika kaa gathan ho chukaa tha
 In 1939, the then Municipal vice-president, Hariharsharan Ji, Dr
 rajendra prasad ke naam par college kholaa, tab rajendra prasad bharat ke pratham raashtrapati nahin bane the, bharat kii azaadi aath saal dur thi, lekin dow
 In the name of Rajendra Prasad, how was his Jeetji College formed? yah bhi ek itihaas he
 At that time there was a flood in Bihar and Rajendra Babu became very popular with his relief work
 us kaam ke sammaan main chhapra main rajendra prasad college khulaa
 His elder brother Mahendra Prasad also contributed to the urbanization of Chapra
 ek kahawat he ki mahendra nahin hote to rajend nahin hote
 All this information was given to us by Professor Lal Babu Yadav, Head of the Department of Political Science
 aaj us college main padhaane ke liye 157 professor-lekturer chahie, magar 33 prophessoron ke dam par hi college chal rahaa he
 There is no one to teach in Chemistry, Sanskrit, Urdu
 bhugol, hindi, commers main sirf ek-ek shikshak hai
 5000 students study in this college
 do saal se sarkaar ne is college ko paisa nahin diya he
 The government has not given its share in lieu of non-payment of fees
 rajend college chhapra se rahul sankrutyaayan kaa naam bhi judaa he
 The great Hindi litterateur Shiva Pujan Sahay used to teach here
 purv mukhyamantri daaroga prasad raay yaheen ke chaatr the
 BJP MP from Maharajganj Janardan Sigriwal was a student of this place
 bhikhaari thakur ko saamne laane vaale manoranjan sinha isi college ke praachaarya the
 But now there is no one to teach in this college
 padhai kaa na naam he na namonishaan he
 There are 150 computers but there is only one computer operator to run them
 1941 kaa he diavi college siwan
 This college was built by the late Baidyanath Prasad Ji
 aaj yahaan 12,000 chaatro ko padhaane ke liye maatr 27 professor-lekturer hai
 a teacher weighs 444 students
 botni, bhugol, sanskrit main koi professor nahin hai
 Only 57 posts are approved, out of which 30 posts are vacant
 bataaya gaya ki 18 professor jo ritair hue hai, unhen hi kabhi-kabhaar bula liya jaataa he, jiskaa paisa bhi nahin diya jaataa, magar ve aate hai or padhaa jate hai
 Ram knows what the education minister of Bihar does yahaan mahavidhyalay main vigyaan main thode bahut upkaran hai, anyathaa bina lab ke class chalaa rahe hai
 It is not only harmful but also a crime
 hamane jitne bhi vaais chancelar se baat kii he, koi to mila jo eemaandaaree se apni vyathaa kah rahaa he
 It is telling that degrees are being given without lab
 ye hanikaarak hi nahin aparaadh bhi he
 Someone will ask their leaders what they left out when they were not going to teach our children
 kya yahi kaaran he ki aaj uniwarsity se zyaada whats ap uniwarsity lokapriy he, professor se zyaada chaatr yaa yuva netaaon ke propeganda ko itihaas or vigyaan maan kar sweekaar kar rahe hai
 JP was born on October 11, but the death was on October 8, so between 8 and 11 October, programs are being conducted in this university about JP
 iske liye alag se bajet nahin aayaa he
 But every kind of competition is happening
 jepi ko yaad karne ke liye in chaatro ne kitni mehnat kii hogi, magar jinhen jepi ke naam par raaj mila he, unhone is uniwarsity ke liye kitni mehnat kii he
 Debate, essay writing competition is being organized
 yahi nahin jepi kii yaad main college main rojgaar mela bhi laga hua tha
 Make them unemployable without a professor and then organize employment fair among them
 jisaki ek tasviir se pataa chalata he ki isamen surakshakarmiyon yani security guard kii bahaali ke liye vishesh bhartee abhiyaan chal rahaa he
 Meaning what could be a better example of dusting
 2013-16 kaa batch 2017 tak khatm nahin ho paaya he
 That is, the session is late
 2015 main second year kii pariksha honi thi, 2017 ke june main hui he
 The first year examination of the 2014-17 batch should have been held in 2015, 2017 has been held in June and the result is yet to come
 2015-18 or 2-16-19 batch kaa imtahaan kab hoga, kisi ko pataa nahin
 Why are these sessions late in university
 isliye hote hai taaki berojgaaron ko kuch saal vahiin campus main roak kar rakho
 Bihar's Education Minister should get a patent on how the session is late
 chhapra ke ramajaypal college ke itihaas vibhaag main paanch saal se ek bhi teacher nahin he
 Think what history these students must have read without a teacher for five years
 aajkal netaa subah-subah jayanti-punyatithi par yaad karne vaale card twit kar dete hai
 You might also wonder how much they respect their old leaders
 haal aap apni ankhon se dekh hi rahe hai
 The leader remembers for the vote
 1972 main gopalganj main mahila vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana hui
 Like the Vice Chancellor of JP University, the principal here also said that speak with my name
 ham kiran ji kii is himmat kaa ehtaraam karte hai
 Many principals started shivering as soon as the phone ran out, hiding their good name
 khasta haal college kaa haal bhi aise bataane lage jaise bharat kaa number ek college unheen kaa ho
 But Kiran ji is not like this
 unhone bataaya ki is college main 26 professor, lekturer hone chahie magar puure nahin hai
 Sanskrit
 itihaas, manovigyaan, raajnneeti vigyaan main koi professor nahin he
 There is a professor in Hindi who is about to retire
 non teaching kii bahut sari siten khaali hai
 There was no restoration for a long time
 college kii saaf-safai karne ke liye bhi log nahin hai
 There are around 960 students
 bhawan kii haalat kharaab he, pustkaalay he lekin librrarian nahin he
 Principal Dr
 Kiran Kumari is continuously writing to the university but there is no hearing
 jab netaa kaa kaam murti banavaakar, jayanti manavaa kar chal hi jaataa he to skool-college main padhaane ke liye professor-teacher kyon rakhen
 Similarly, HR College is a college in Marawa
 yahaan maatr 4 professor hai, hone chahie 17
 We took the hall of the university built in memory of Jayaprakash Narayan
 ab ham dindalai upaadhyaay kii smriti main bane vishvavidhyalay kaa haal lenge
 Deen Dayal Upadhyay University, Gorakhpur
 1957 se gorakhpur uniwarsity chal rahi he
 This university was started with the efforts of Pandit SM Tripathi
 manhat digvijaynath kaa bhi yogadan tha, unheen kii parampara ke duusare uttaradhikari yogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri hai
 Looking at the photos, it seemed that the campus of Gorakhpur University is very bright and clean
 gorakhpur uniwarsity kaa naam dinadayal upaadhyaay gorakhpur uniwarsity he
 This campus has more than 16000 students
 har saal yahaan 5000 se adhik chaatr admician lete hai
 How many teachers come to this university campus, we are coming to that
 365 pad yahaan manzur hai magar 25 pad khaali hai

 The first year examination of the 2014-17 batch should have been held in 2015, 2017 has been held in June and the result is yet to come
 2015-18 or 2-16-19 batch kaa imtahaan kab hoga, kisi ko pataa nahin
 Why are these sessions late in university
 isliye hote hai taaki berojgaaron ko kuch saal vahiin campus main roak kar rakho
 Bihar's Education Minister should get a patent on how the session is late

 If you want to destroy your political opponent, the best way is to go to his stronghold and be defeated
 isse na sirf virdohi kii haar hoti he balki uski party ke kaaryakartaaon kaa hausala bhi puri tarah tut jaataa he
 The BJP, which has consolidated the Congress to 44 seats, is now working on the same strategy against its future president Rahul Gandhi
 makasad he rahul ko unke garh amethi main maat dena taaki puure desh main congressiyon kaa hausala tut jaae or congress mukt bharat ke piem modi ke sapane ko saakaar kiya ja sake
 Amethi Congress Fort After Independence, Congress contested countless seats and tasted victory or defeat but if one seat is talked about where Congress candidate means victory is guaranteed, then that seat is Amethi of UP Awadh
 amethi par congress ke rutabe kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki yahaan ab tak hue 15 loksabhaa chunaavon main se 13 baar congress ne jeet hasil kii he
 However, instead of calling Amethi a Congress bastion, it would be more right to be called the stronghold of the Gandhi family, because out of the 13 elections in which the party has won this seat, 9 times the candidate has been from the Gandhi family
 sanjay-rajeev-sonia or rahuahmethi 1967 main loksabhaa seat bani
 After this, there have been 15 Lok Sabha elections here
 yahaan se indira gandhi ke chote bete sanjay gandhi 1980 main chunaav lade or jite
 After his untimely death, Rajiv Gandhi was declared the winner from here in 1981, 1984, 1989
 1991 main bhi rajeev gandhi yahaan se jite lekin unke nidhan ke baad captain satish sharma ko yahaan se utaara gaya
 In 1999, Sonia Gandhi contested from Amethi and entered politics and won
 agle chunaav main yani 2004 main rahul gandhi yaha se lade or jite
 Rahul's winning streak continued in 2009 and 2014 as well
 bijepi ne lagaai sendhacongress yaa gandhi parivaar ke is garh main bijepi ne aisi sendhamari kii ki yahaan ke gharon kii deevaaron se congress netaaon ke poster utarane lage hai or unheen khootiyon par modi ke calendar najar aane lage hai
 It started with the 2014 Lok Sabha elections where, to the surprise of everyone and contrary to political traditions, PM Modi fielded Smriti Irani in the face of Rahul Gandhi
 rahul gandhi ne smriti irani ko bhale hi haraa diya ho
 But Smriti Irani is continuously active in Amethi
 pichley 6 maheene main 3 baar unhone amethi kaa daura kiya he
 Even before this, she has been going to Amethi continuously
 amethi kii jameen par bijepi kii is kavayad kaa asar dekha ja saktaa he
 Today BJP President Amit Shah himself, Information Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath held a big public meeting in Amethi
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki teenon netaaon ke nishane par rahul gandhi rahe
 He laid the foundation stone or inaugurated 21 schemes there
 makasad vikaas ke mudde par rahul or gandhi parivaar ko gherna he
 Despite the Congress being a stronghold of the Durgagandhi family, Amethi does not have the stream of development that is seen in the area of other big leaders (like Mulayam Singh Yadav's native village Saifai), this quiet and underdeveloped part of UP is happy in this pride It remains that it is the workplace of the largest political family in the country
 lekin ab ye tasviir dhoomil hone lagi he or congress ke durg kii diwaar darkane lagi he
 In the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, Rahul won from Amethi by about 3 lakh 70 thousand votes
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main rahul ke khilaaf smriti irani maidan main thim, to rahul kii jeet kaa margin ghatakar 1 lakh ke kareeb aa gaya
 There are a total of five assembly seats in Amethi and at present the Congress does not have a single seat
 2017 ke chunaav main amethi kii paanch main se 4 siton par bijepi or ek par sapa ne jeet darj kii thi
 In this way, if we look at the results of the 2012 assembly elections, only 2 of the five seats were with the Congress and 3 seats with the SP
 congress ke garh main sendhacongress ke ghar main bijepi lagaataar sendhamari kar rahi he
 Many Congress leaders from Amethi have left the party and joined the BJP and other parties
 inamen amethi kshetra kii tiloi vidhansabha se vidhayak rahe doctor muslim ne bispi kaa daaman thama to vahiin congressi rajyasabha sadsy dow
 Sanjay Singh's first wife Garima Singh and son Anant Vikram Singh joined BJP
 garima singh philhal amethi se vidhayak hai
 Congress leader Jung Bahadur Singh also joined Mangalavar as BJP
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan sapa ke mayanshwar sharan singh bijepi main chale gaye or tiloi se unhone jeet bhi darj kii
 Similarly, Dalbahadur Kori, who was the BSP leader of Salon, also returned home to BJP during the elections and Salon is an MLA from the assembly
 saaf he ki in netaaon ko ab congress main apana bhavishya nahin dikhaai de rahaa he
 The question arises that when these workers of the land are breaking ties with the party, how and on whom Rahul will be able to save this political fortress

 Known for its heritage and history for a long time, Rajasthan is witnessing fresh changes
 raghavendra rathod ne jahaan rajasthan ko fishan ke falak par jagah dilwaai, vahiin ek samoochee peedi fishan kii vibhinn theme ke saath nit nae-nae prayog karti hui saamne aa rahi he
 New emerging designers and models are bringing fresh air through their boutiques and studios, and thanks to these efforts, fashion shows have been organized in the state
 haal hi main jaipur ko ek nayaa thikaana ji studio mila, jahaan sthaneey dizinron ke banaae fishan kaa asardaar collection pesh kiya gaya
 The example of such creativity was presented in a very beautifully organized dog show, where a crowd of lovers of this pet thronged
 magar jis cheez ne yahaan aane waalon ko mantrmugdh kar diya he, vah he rajya main haal hi ke dinon main khanpan ke thikaanon kii ai bahaar
 It was not long when most of the national highways of the state had to work hard to find a Dhaba of Qaeda
 ab khubasurat sthapaty or banaavat main dhali jagahen hai, jo amuman airkandishand hai or yahaan kuch der itmeenaan se padaav daalaa ja saktaa he
 In Rajasthan, there has been a lot of concern about cleanliness in the road side openings
 lekin ab kai mahange restaraanon ke khul jane se is afsane main ek sukhad mode aa gaya he
 Some of these restaurants provide excellent dining facilities with wine and are for those who spend a good amount of money
 vahiin kai duusare restaraan bhi hai jo shaakaahaari or gaiyr-shaakaahaari, donon lajij vyanjan or duniya bhar ke anuthe videshi jaayke pesh karte hai
 An interesting trend is rooftop or open restaurants on the roofs
 haalanki inamen se kai niyam-kaayadon or aag se suraksha ke maanakon kaa ulanghan karke khole gaye hai
 However, the experience of sitting and eating food under the open sky on the roof of skyscrapers from where heat and pollution, where the far-flung city skyline and sparkling roads can be enjoyed, is so unique that pie- The pie is recovered
 phir shahar main nae khul rahe discothek hai
 Nightclubs are also opening, though their concept is still new to the city
 kuch jagahon par khud apane dam par aayojan kiye jate hai, to kahin-kahin par duusari jagahon se deje or dancer bulaae jate hai
 Rajasthan is traditionally known for distinct houses of art
 soobe ke doordaraj ke ilaakon main kai kalakaar hai jo apni kala ko dur-dur tak le ja rahe hai
 They lack resources, but no lack of experimentation
 ve paaramparik, fusion or aadhunik shaileyon main kism-kism ke prayog kar rahe hai jinhen rajya bhar main hone vaali kala pradarshiyon main dhooma machaate dekha ja saktaa he
 Similarly, traditional forms of dance and music, including folk dances, are being used in such a way that they are bringing a fresh breath of freshness to these art forms and gaining fame
 yuva peedi kii ore se kii ja rahi in koshishon se un sailaaniyon kii bhi balle-balle he jo baar-baar dohraye jane vaale pradarshnon main nayaapan or anoothaapan dekhnaa chaahate hai
 The state is also a rich treasure of handicrafts or handcrafted art
 rajya nafis dastakaari ke liye janaa jaataa he, chaahe vah furniture main ho yaa kalakritiyon main yaa gahanon-aabhushanon main
 The diocese is also known for producing spectacular trophies which are given in almost every kind of competitions as well as the top sporting events around the world
 rajya ke smarakon, tirthasthalon or kala ddeerghaaon ko bhi nayaa rang-rup diya gaya he
 Rajasthan has also emerged as a venue for conferences and conferences
 pichley paanch saal main rajya main dheron chote or bade hotel khule hai
 But the one event that has increased the popularity of the state immensely is the Jaipur Literature Festival
 is aayojan kii lokapriyata lagaataar bad rahi he
 Whether drawn to serious literary debates or popular writing sessions, or just to join hands with famous writers or take selfies with them, or aspire to know their creativity, people of all kinds are drawn into it
 in saare lutf ke saath behtareen libaas main saj-dhajkar matargashti karne kii khaasi gunjaaish yah festival detaa he
 Due to this many other events are also being organized across the state, which are associated with films, short films, literature and various arts
 kilon, mehalon or mandiron main puure saal bhar kuch shandaar sufi or sangeet kii mehfilein sajati hai
 The result of this speed and experimentation is that on social media, many issues are being debated more deeply
 inamen in kaaryakramon kii tikhi aalochanaayen bhi kii jaati hai, to mukhar kaside bhi padhe jate hai
 Another ray of hope is the return of IPL matches in the state
 rajasthan cricket association kaaphi vakt se antarkalah kaa shikaar rahaa he
 For this reason, Rajasthan, which emerged as an important state organizing matches and even winning the Ranji Trophy for the first time in the last decade, lost its direction by being trapped in a maze of indiscriminate political deceit
 ab ummid kii ja rahi he ki kai saal baad ek baar phir ipiel maichon kaa aayojan karke rajya roshni main aa jayega
 This will help the emerging sportspersons of the state, some of whom have been selected for the IPL
 rajya ke paas khelon main uplabdhiyon ke taur par bataane ke liye bahut kam chijen hai or is maamle main thodaa bhi sudhaar badi raahat kii baat hogi
 The Center had also recently organized rural sports in Jaipur
 yah chunaav kaa saal he or rajya ke falak par yuva siyasatdanon ke ubharne kaa betaabi se intjaar kiya ja rahaa he
 So far very few young politicians have emerged because the old players are not allowing them to emerge
 rajasthan main pathar, sangemarmar or chamade ke kaarobaar main lage parivaar bhi hai jo rajya ke buniyadi udhyami hai
 Rajasthanis have also worn their flags in other states and some of them are leaving their mark abroad
 haalanki videshon main bahut acha kaam kar rahe apravasi bharatiyon main rajasthan ke logon kii taadaad utani nahin he jitani gujaratiyon yaa punjabiyon kii he, par yah rujhaan jarur dekha ja saktaa he ki zyada se zyada enarai rajasthan kii seva karne laut rahe hai
 Higher education facilities are gradually getting better in the state
 medical sector ne aspataalon or shiksha, donon main jabardast badhotaree dekhi he or vishvavidhyalay behatar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Private universities are offering a lot of options and after the quota, Jaipur is also emerging as a center for coaching institutes
 mandi ke baavjood mal badi taadaad main logon ko khinch rahe hai
 Walking across the state shows that the town and the city are buzzing with the glory of the markets
 alabatta shaharon or kasbon main sadakon kii haalat beshak bahut kharaab dikhaai detii he
 Public transport facilities have declined
 sadakon par gadipoon kii bheedbhad din-ba-din badtar hoti ja rahi he
 No one is bothered about maintaining the lane system and discipline and every lane of national highways is lined with trucks and buses, which makes them a driving experience
 iske baavjood rajasthan main jindagi pehle kii banisbat tej raftaar se kulaanche bhar rahi he
 Rajasthan, with its rich heritage that traces its roots to the Harappan era, is becoming younger by the day
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne ek baar phir ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar bada bayaan diya he

 He says that authors do not want to allow their authorship to be feminist, because being a feminist is abusive
 feminist hona ek siraphire hone kii nishaani he
 He believes that even if a writer writes independently while living in his area, he is still accused that it does not include women who come from rural areas or women who are actually victims

 Chauhan said - i am not a woman or a man, but only the writer, on the question related to writing on female discourse, Chauhan said that so far literature has not risen in the world and gender, so how can literature arise
 sahitya main bhi lekhak ke nijee soch kaa prabhaav padataa he

 State Congress President Manikrao Thackeray had said that the government has to decide on allowing the memorial
 unhone kaha, ‘agar sarkaar pradesh congress kaa rukh jaananaa chaahati he to main adhikariyon ko bataaunga
 NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said that the Shivaji Park where Thackeray was cremated on Sunday falls under the Shiv sena-bjp-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), so he has to take a decision
 maharashtra sarkaar ne kaha he ki agar smarak kii maang kii gayi to vah uske prastaav par ‘sakaaratmak tareeke’ se vichaar karegi
 However, civic organizations in Shivaji Park have lodged protests over the move

 Shivaji Park is in the memory of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj

 In Uttar Pradesh, the SP and BSP have entered the political arena of the Lok Sabha elections by forming an alliance
 haalanki, sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke pita or party sangrakshak mulaayam singh yadav ne aisa vito power lagaaya he, jisase purvanchal kii jonpur va baliya seat par pech fansaa gaya he
 The problems of both Akhilesh and Mayawati have increased
 isi ke chalate gathbandhan jonpur or baliya seat par ummidavaare ko faisla nahin le paa rahaa he
 In the SP-BSP alliance, the Jaunpur seat has gone to the BSP and the Ballia seat to the sp's account
 aise main basapa ne jonpur se ummidavaari ko lekar abhi faisla nahin kiya he
 Whereas, SP was preparing to field Neeraj Shekhar, son of former PM Chandrasekhar from Ballia
 bhaajapa ne maujuuda saansad bharat singh kaa tikat kaat diya he
 Now Bharat Singh has taken a rebellious stand
 aise main sapa is seat par jeet ko lekar aashwast najar aa rahi he
 If sources are to be believed, Mulayam Singh, unhappy with the SP-BSP alliance, wants to contest his close and former MP Parasnath Yadav in Jaunpur seat
 aise main unhone apana vito power lagaate hue parasnath yadav ko ummidavaar banane ke liye unke naam ko sapa adhyaksh akhilesh yadav ke paas badha diya he
 Akhilesh is confused by this
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mulaayam singh ne shivpal yadav ke liye jaswantnagar or parasnath yadav ke liye jonpur kii malhani seat par vot maangane gaye the
 Akhilesh has already declared Shafiqur Rahman Burke as a candidate, bypassing the name of Aparna Yadav, who was raised by Mulayam Singh in the Sambhal Lok Sabha seat
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki mulaayam singh ne khule taur par basapa ke saath gathbandhan karne ke faisle kii alochana kii thi
 At the same time, now if Jaunpur seat is ignored, if Mulayam's suggested name is ignored then his displeasure may increase
 haalanki, jonpur seat basapa ke khate main he
 In such a situation, Akhilesh requested BSP President Mayawati to leave Jaunpur seat for SP
 sutron ke mutabik is par mayawati ne saaf kaha ki jonpur seat ko ek hi surat main chodi sakati he ki sapa uske badale baliya seat de
 However, Akhilesh Ballia does not want to give up the seat
 wo iske badale duusari anya seat dena chaah rahe hai, lekin basapa adhyaksh is par raji nahin hai
 Due to this, till now both parties are not able to take any decision regarding their candidates in these two seats
 mulaayam singh yadav kii raajnneeti pahaado kii barish jaisi he jo kabhi bhi or kahin bhi baras sakati he
 Changes in this happen even after the final decisions
 lekin philhal samaajawaadee party raajnneeti ke jis muhane par khadi he, vahaan se vaapasi ke raste kam ho jate hai
 Return is not good for anyone
 na to akhilesh ke liye or na hi mulaayam singh yadav ke liye
 Because the damage that has now been done to the party is not going to be compensated by any coordination
 balki or adhiknuksaanatay he
 But if anyone can be the biggest beneficiary in this whole development, and if there is a positive scope for anyone, then it is the Bharatiya Janata Party
 bhartiya janata party is puure ghatnakram ko sapa kaa aantarik maamla bataa rahi he or asthirataa kii duhai dekar istife kii maang kar rahi he
 BJP spokespersons have started singing the melody of development in the rain of the SP
 iske peeche kaa mantavya bhi saaf samaj aa rahaa he
 In fact, the preparation with which Akhilesh went ahead with the election was a good sign for the SP
 acha isliye kyonki bihar kii tarj par bhaajapa ko pradesh main rokane ke liye sapa, congress or kuch anya raajnneetik dalon kaa gathjod ek majboot vikalp banakar ubharne vaale the
 Both Modi and Mayawati were restless with this alliance
 modi isliye kyonki is gathjod main bihar kii punrariti kii sambhaavna nihit thi or mayawati isliye kyonki unki isbaar kii dalit-muslim votbank vaali chemistry is gathbandhan ke baad vifal hoti nazar aa rahi thi
 Now that clouds of instability have covered the province, the BJP would like to present itself as a permanent and better alternative among the weaker regional parties
 mahagathbandhan ke prayog se chintit bhaajapa ke liye mulaayam singh yadav kii press conference nishchay hi ek acchhee ghoshnaa thi
 Mayawati is not in a position to play far away with only the dalit-muslim vote bank
 unke kamazor padane se daliton kaa bhi ek hissaa bhaajapa kii ore sthirataa or hindutv jaise naaron ke zarie aakarshith ho saktaa he
 Why are the BJP in favor, if Akhilesh and Mulayam stood up to fight like Akbar and Salim in the field, apart from cutting each other's votes, they do not appear to be able to reach anywhere at the moment
 israajnneetik araajaktaaka sidhaa laabh do partiyaan le sakati hai
 One Congress and the other BJP
 lekin congress khud dialysis par chal rahi party jaisi he or uske liye yah avasar dur kii kaudi he
 Therefore, in this trigonometry, the BJP is seen to be benefiting the most and it will not miss to cash in on it
 notebandi par apni kirakiri kara chuki party ab asthirataa or kunbe kii ladaai ko apana mantra banaakar logon ke bich jaaegi or sthirataa or vikaas jaise naaron ke saath vot maangegi
 However, SP and Mulayam are known for politics like flowing water and no picture is final
 lekin jo nuksaan sapa ko ho chukaa he, use bhunaane se bhaajapa kyonkar chuke
 The sp's battle is a sign of good days for the BJP in the state
 dilli main AAP sarkaar ke mantriyon dwaara saadagi kii misaal pesh karne ko mil rahe jansamarthan ko bhunaane ke liye upi main mantri bhi isamen kud pade hai

 iske baad unhen laplas colony main 101 number flats mil gaya

 shahid ko samaajawaadee party ne meerut se loksabhaa pratyaashee bhi ghoshit kiya he
 Shahid Manzoor will be the first minister of the government who has decided to move to a flat, except to live in a big bungalow
 shahid isi maheene nae saal kii badhai dene ke liye meerut main motorcycle se hi nikal pade the

 amitabh bachchan or aamir khan ke phans ke liye khushkhabari he

 darasalyashraj binarake tale nirdeshak vijay krishan aacharya kii agalifilm 'thag'casting ko lekar bahut vakt se surkhiyon main he
 Earlier there was news that Amitabh is going to work with Hrithik in this film, then there were also reports of Amitabh not working in the film and now it is being said that Aamir Khan can be seen in the role of 'thug' instead of Hrithik
 aamir ke liye ummid isliye bhi bad jaati he kyonki vijay krishn aacharya ke saath 'dhooma 3' main wo kaam kar chuke hai
 Director Vijay has neither denied this nor said that this news is true

 He started cutting the pockets of others and making money from shopkeepers in a crowded market
 phir chaaku lekar bhi chalane laga
 One day when someone told him something upside-down, a quarrel started suddenly

 The boy died

 acchhee baat yah he ki uski nashe kii lat chhot chuki he

 Sunil Gavaskar, former captain of the Indian cricket team and a great batsman, has reacted to the Mudgal Committee report in the IPL spot-fixing case, saying that former BCCI president n Srinivasan has got a clean chit and therefore it would be wrong to further prosecute him

 IPL spot-fixing: COO Sundar Raman may be sacked! Sunil Gavaskar said in an exclusive interview, 'whatever should be revealed in the Mudgal Committee report, there should be strict legal action against Gurunath Meiyappan
 shrinivasana ke khilaaf faisle main kaha gaya ki unhen sidhe taur par nahin pataa tha ki khilaadi phixing main lipt the
 So it would be wrong to further prosecute them in this case

 This will make things transparent, it is still banned and it is not working properly
 betting se sarkaar revenue kamayegi or khule taur par aisa hoga
 Gavaskar said, "if the team owners are found guilty then it will be wrong to punish the team players or the IPL franchise
 bharat main nayaa kanoon hona chahie jiske mutabik phixing main lipt paae jane vaale cricketer ko jail ho
 If they are found to be involved in fixing, then all their records should be deleted

 Kejriwal, who is in collusion with BJP and Congress, also pointed at the attack and protest against AAP candidates and raised the question that why not do the same with Congress leaders? Alleging a nexus between the Congress and the BJP, he said that both parties see only AAP as their enemy, hence the target of both of them is aap's leader-candidate

 This will be the 2000th Test match and if we consider the figures so far, the hosts have been dominating the 100, 200, 1000 i
e
 almost every hundredth Test match
 bharat abhi duniya kii number ek test team he lekin england ne bhi lambii avadhi ke praaroop main pichley do saal main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 It will not be easy for India to face its fast bowlers on the fast and swinging pitches there
 iske alaava 2000waan test hone ke kaaran aankade bhi bharat ke khilaaf hi hai
 So far, if the results of every hundredth Test match of first, 100th, 200th and so forth are considered, then the hosts have been successful in winning most matches
 isamen pehla test match bhi shaamil kiya jaataa he to ab tak aise 20 match main se 14 kaa parinaam niklaa he jinamein se das match main mejabaan team vijayi rahi he
 If India wants to break this myth, it will have to perform like Australia or West Indies
 austrailia ne ek jabaki westeindies ne teen avasaron par videshi sarajameen par is tarah ke test maichon main jeet darj kii
 The good news for India is that the host team that lost on these four occasions was from England
 melbern main khelaa gaya pehla test match mejabaan austrailia ne 45 ran se jeeta tha
 After this, the 100th Test match was played in Sydney, which again won Australia
 england ne 1948 main 300wein test match kii mejabani kii thi lekin tab mehmaan austrailia jeet gaya tha
 The fifth match of the series played in 1955 in Karachi between India and Pakistan was the 400th Test
 yah match anirnit samaapt hua tha
 Apart from this, the result of Test number 1200, played in 1992 between India and South Africa in Durban, could not be achieved
 australia ne 600wein or 800wein test match main bhi apane chir pratidwandvi england ko apni sarajameen par maat di thi
 In addition to defeating England on its soil in such matches, the West Indies also won the 900th Test match played on the Caribbean soil (bridgetown) in 1981
 pakistan or newjiland ke bich hyderabad main 1984 main khelaa gaya match 1000waan test tha
 In this, the hosts Pakistan had won by seven wickets
 in donon tiimon ke bich hi lahore main 2002 main 1600waan test match khelaa gaya tha jisamen pakistan ne pari or 324 ran se badi jeet darj kii thi
 England suffered most defeats in such matches but in the 1700th match played at Lord's in 2004, it was able to break the myth associated with every 100th Test for the first time
 vah england ke vartmaan captain andrew straas kaa pehla test match tha
 Strauss was instrumental in England's victory over New Zealand by scoring a century

 On Thursday, Pratap Chandra Sarangi took oath as a minister in the Modi government formed under the 17th Lok Sabha in the Rashtrapati Bhavan complex
 bijepi ke tikat par balasore loksabhaa seat se jeet darj kar sansad pahunche 64 varshiya pratap chandra saarangi logon ke bich 'odisha kaa modi' ke naam se bhi jane jate hai
 People compare his life and his lifestyle with PM Modi
 pradhanmantri narendra modi jab odisha pahunchate hai to pratap se jarur mulaakaat karte hai
 Famous for his simplistic lifestyle, Pratap has defeated BJD MP and billionaire candidate Rabindra Kumar Jena
 saarangi ne jis andaaj main chunaav ladaa, vah bhi bilkul alag tha
 While the other candidates were sitting in big vehicles and doing election campaigns, Sarangi autorickshaw used to rally
 vah cycle se campan karne nikal padate the
 He relied more on his party workers than professional managers
 vah kabhi jaanwaron kii seva karte hue najar aate hai to kabhi kisi gupha main sadhana main leen
 The people of this simplicity have become admired
 chunaav jeetne ke baad bhi unki jindagi main bahut badlaav nahin aayaa he
 When he won assembly elections in 2004 and 2009 on a BJP ticket, he continued to live with the same simplicity
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki unhone apane chunaav prachaar main bilkul kharch nahin kiya
 Pratap Chandra Sarangi (photo-ani), swearing in the Modi government, he says that my lifestyle has been such since childhood
 mere saansad banane ke baad bhi yah badalane vaala nahin he
 i am working for the people and the country and i will continue to implement it throughout my life

 Like Modi, Sarangi also set out on the path of becoming a monk in his youth
 vah ramakrishna math bhi gaye lekin saadhuon ne unhen maa kii seva karne kii salaah di jiske baad vah ghar laut gaye
 Sarangi's house is also raw and his simplicity makes everyone convincing
 ve apni jeet kaa shrey bhi modi ko dete hai
 He says people here wanted to see Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of the country
 logon ne unke netritv or bijepi kii vikaas kii koshishon par vishwaas kiya

 bhagwaan shri krishna ne kai aise chamatkaar kiye, jisko aaj bhi sunaaya jaataa he
 One such miracle is when Shri Krishna created a lila to break the pride of Lord Indra
 katha ke mutabik bhagwaan indra ko apni shaktiyon or pad par ghamand ho gaya tha jise chakanachur karne ke liye bhagwaan shri krishna ne ek lila rachi
 He explained to the people of Vrindavan that they should leave the worship of Lord Indra and worship Govardhan Parvat
 jiske baad bhagwaan indra gussa ho gaye or vrundavan par musaladhar barish kii
 To avoid the wrath of Indra, Lord Krishna lifted the entire Govardhan mountain on the junior finger of his left hand, that is, the little finger
 log parvat ke neeche aa gaye or khud ko bachaa liya
 Indra rained continuously for 7 days but finally realized his mistake
 bhagwaan indra khud dharti par utre or shri krishna se maafee maangi
 Kaliya Nag Daman is one of the innumerable feats of Lord Krishna
 kaaliya sarp kaa asli ghar ramanakaa dweep tha, garud ke bhay ke kaaran wo wahaase apni patniyon ke saath vrindavan main aa basaa
 He started living in Yamuna river
 nadi itani jahrili ho gai thi ki pani se bulbule nikalne lage the
 Once Krishna went to play ball with his friends
 khelte-khelte gend nadi main chali gai
 Shri Krishna climbed from the Kadamb tree and jumped into the river
 kaliya nad apni das bhujaase jehar ko bahaar nikalataa tha or krishna ke sharir ke chaaron ore se lapet liya tha
 Shri Krishna faced every attack of Kalia and forced Hok Kalia Nag to take refuge
 kaaliya naag ne shri krishna se maafi maangi or jeevandaan ke liye vinati kii
 When Lord Krishna is teaching the Gita to Arjuna, he also said that he had given this preaching to Suryadev earlier
 tab arjuna ne aashcharya vyakt karte hue kaha tha ki suryadev to pracheen devtaa hai to aap suryadev ko ye upadesh pehle kaise de sakate hai
 Then Shri Krishna had told Arjuna that many births had taken place before you and me
 tum un janmon ke bare main nahin jaanate, lekin main jaanata hum
 In this way, the knowledge of the Gita was first received not by Arjuna but by Suryadev
 bhagwaan shri krishna kii bal lila kii katha he, ek subah krishna apane mitron ke sang khel rahe the
 Balarama saw that Krishna had eaten the soil
 ve or unke mitra maa yashoda se isaki shikaayat karne pahunche -"jaldi chalo maan, krishna mitti kha rahaa he
 "yashoda Mata ran immediately and holding Krishna's hand and bringing it closer asked -" Did you eat mud? "krishna looked at the mother and said innocently," Otherwise! Friends are lying
 dekho meraa munh, kya maine mitti khai he?" aisa kahkar krishna ne apana munh khol diya
 Mata Yashoda could not see the soil, instead Yashoda Mata appeared in the mouth of Krishna to the whole universe - mountains, islands, seas, planets, stars
 sampoorn sristi dikhaai di
 Yudhishthira betrayed Draupadi at the time of Dyutkrida in the Mahabharata and Draupadi was conquered by Mama Shakuni on behalf of Duryodhana
 us samay dushasan draupadi ko baalo se pakadakar ghasitate hue sabha main le aayaa
 On seeing Duryodhana's orders, Dushasan started unloading Draupadi's saree in front of the entire assembly
 sabhi maun the, pandav bhi draupadi kii laaj bachaane main asamarth ho gaye
 Draupadi then closed her eyes and called on Vasudev Shri Krishna
 shrikrishna us vakt sabha main maujuud nahin the
 Draupadi said, "O Govind, today there is a war between faith and non-faith
 aaj mujhe dekhnaa he ki ishwar he ki nahin''
 Then Shri Krishna presented a miracle to everyone and Draupadi's sari got longer till the misrule fainted and all were numb
 sabhi ko samaj main aa gaya ki yah chamatkaar he

 jadeja ne ek match 6 wicket liye, lekin aswin ko abhi is desh main apana khaataa kholana he
 Ashwin did not get a wicket despite scoring 42 overs in the Johannesburg Test in India's previous tour

 On Monday, the students came to protest on campus and they had a fierce fight with Delhi Police
 police ne chaatro par pani kii bauchhaar kii, dhakka-mukki bhi hui lekin chaatr apane pradarshan or maangon par ade rahe
 The convocation ceremony was also going on at the university on Monday, in which Union Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal had arrived but the students started protesting outside
 jisaki vajah se mantri kai ghante andar hi fanse rahe
 Demonstrating students outside the gate, there was a demand that they would not stop demonstrating until the University Vice Chancellor comes forward
 kyon pradarshan kar rahe hai chaatr?chaatro kaa aarope he ki JNU prashasan nehostel fees main kaaphi badhotaree kar di he, saath hi hostel kii timming main bhi badlaav kiya gaya he
 The JNU administration has increased hostel, mess and security fees by 400 percent in its recent directives
 iske saath hi nae nirdesh main chatravaas aane-jane kii samaysima bhi simit kar di gai he
 According to the charges of the students, there has been an increase in hostel fees
 
 
 - single seater hostel: pehle rum rent 20 rupee tha, lekin ab 600 rupee- dabl seater hostel: pehle rum rent 10 rupee tha, lekin ab 300 rupee- pehle bijli-pani free, lekin ab charge kii baat- 1700 rupee sarvice charge alag se- mess kii security 5500 rupee pehle, ab 12 hajaar rupee- raat 11 baje ke baad hostel se baahar nikalne par pabandi- nayaa dress code lagu karne par vichaarojhnu chaatro ke pradarshan par raajnneetik bayaanbaji bhi hui or kai netaaon ne chaatro ke samarthan main aawaaj uthaai

 dilli vishvavidhyalay chaatrasangh chunaav ke maddenjar enesayuai ne freshars ko lubhaane kii kavayad shuru kar di he
 In this series, NSUI organized University Cultural Fest on Monday
 talkatoraa stadium main yojit enesayuai ke is fest main kai nami singron ko bulaayaa gaya
 Inside the stadium, where NSUI was entertaining the fasers through a musical show, the DUSU rules were being dismantled outside the stadium
 ye donon tasviren enenyuai ke cultural fest kii he
 The Cultural Fest which gives a glimpse of muscle power and money power dominating Dusu's riot in DU
 ye to mahaj shuruyaat he
 But this method of gathering votes to win DUSU elections is quite old in DU
 pichley saal sivaieses ne rock sho ke jariye freshars ko lubhaane kii koshish kii to is saal enenyuai aise cultural sho ke bahaane freshars ko voton main badalane kii jugat laga rahi he
 In the event of NSUI, Jogia Khali Bali fame Punjabi singer Bhupi entertained the freshers by singing many hit numbers, while every student sitting in the stadium started singing on songs like girl beautiful of razor Faizalpuria
 fest main jasbinder jassi, dilbagh singh, sanam singh or kamedian darasi bharedia jaise kalakaaron ne shirkat kii
 Most of the students who attended this fest of NSUI were freshers
 jinhone pop singer se lekar raper tak sabhi ke parformens ko khub enjoy kiya or jamkar thumake lagaaye
 Sakshi Malik, who won the bronze medal in the Hauslao Olympics, also joined the NSUI Fest, which brought glory to the country
 enesayuai ne jahaan sakshi malik ko smriti chinh dekar sammanit kiya to vahi sakshi ne sabhi chaatro ko protsaahit kiya
 The nsui's Cultural Fest was in full swing inside the broken-down Dusu rules-fest at the Fest, while outside the stadium, slips of names of potential candidates were scattered on the ground
 kaaron kaa kafila bhi poster se las tha or to or cartoon kairectorrs ke jariye sambhavit ummidavaar apana prachaar bhi kar rahe the
 Which is a violation of the guidelines of the straight-through election
 haalanki enesayuai ise kaaryakartaaon or chaatro kaa josh bataakar bachane kii koshish kar rahi he
 According to NSUI National President Amrita Dhawan, the candidates have not been announced yet, so often students or activists do it by coming in enthusiasm and enthusiasm
 lekin enesayuai puri tarah paper free chunaav ke paksh main he, haalanki diu ko vikalp ke taur par college main waal of demokrasi jaise opshan dene chahie taaki ummidavaar prachaar kar sake
 ABVP is describing this fest of NSUI as demonstrating Dhanbal and Bahubal
 abivipi ke rashtriya media sanyojak saket bahuguna ke mutabik enesayuai sirf chunaav ke samay aakaar chaatro ko kharidne kii koshish karti he lekin diu ke vidhyaarthee ab inhen pahchaan gaye hai
 Students know that ABVP only works on the ground throughout the campus
 isiilie aise fest se koi fark nahin padataa
 ABVP will win all four seats by defeating this power and muscle power
 vahi enesayuai ise mani or masal power kaa game nahin balki freshars ko welcome karne ke liye yojit kiya gaya fest bataa rahi hai
 It is another matter that the welcome program was not mentioned anywhere in the entire program or in the banner-posters
 khayr, dusu chunaav ko dekhte hue freshars ko lubhaane kii is kavayad main enesayuai kitna safal hui ye to chunaav ke baad hi pataa chalegaa
 In fact, ABVP has been in possession of DUSU for the last three years, so this year NSUI would like to win DUSU elections in order to preserve its credibility
 yahi vajah he ki congress netaa or saansad dipendra huda, auskar furnandis or yoganand shastri jaise kaddavar netaa bhi is fest main shirkat karte or enesayuai se judane kii apil karte najar aae
 It will be interesting to see who will win Dusu's riot

 Media personnel are being attacked with sharp weapons

 On the instructions and questions of the High Court, they were saying that there is complete preparation

 But the question is if there was so much preparation from where the sharp weapons are being got from the Dera supporters
 logon par hamale karne ke liye deraa samarthakon ke paas hathiyaar kahaan se aae
 On the question of security, Sandhu said that the situation is completely under control
 police bal ke alaava kendriya balon ke karmi badi sankhya main panchkula pahunch gaye he or unhen tainaat kar diya gaya he
 No one will be allowed to visit the area around the court and only those who are needed there will be allowed to go
 unhone bataaya ki sirsa shahar or aasapaas ke teen gaanvon main karfu lagu kar diya gaya he lekin panchkula ke liye abhi tak aisa koi faisla nahin liya gaya
 Asked if the Dera supporters refused to leave, Sandhu said, "we are capable and ready to deal with any situation"
 unhone bataaya ki haryana police ke karmiyon ne panchkula main ekatrit kuch deraa samarthakon se chaate or anya saamaan jabt kar liye hai
 He said, we investigated them

 We have seized umbrellas and have taken possession of the buses and vehicles from which they arrived here

 Taking a dig at the state government, former Chief Minister of Haryana Bhupendra Singh Hooda said that the situation in Panchkula is deteriorating and if the Haryana government was ready in advance, then it would not have happened
 hooda ne kaha he ki philhal sarkaar par wo zyada tippanee nahin karenge or is vakt halaat saamaanya hona sabase jaruri he
 In such a situation, the question is that the DGP was not aware of the violence happening on such a large scale
 aakhir prashasan ne deraa samarthakon ko itnaa mauka kyon diya
 Why were they allowed to assemble
 rajya main faili hinsa ke liye dijipi kya jimmedaari lenge

 The refugee crisis that shook the world was defined as an attempt by the people of war-torn Syria to enter Europe
 lekin jo log pashchimi deshon main pravesh karne kii koshish kar rahe hai unki sankhya bahut hi kam he
 Less than 10% of the millions of people reach Europe, Western countries are far from the rest
 is puure hafte enditivi par palaayan se judi vishesh shrunkhlaa, jiske tahat hamane sharnaarthi sankat kii adrishy jadon ko dhundne kii koshish kii
 Here is the first episode of this series from the syrian-turkish border
 
 
 yuddh se trast desh ke ek chor par based ek shahar main hamaari mulaakaat 12 saal ke jemagin se hui
 Jemjin is a resident of Cobain, who arranges shelves in a clothes shop in the Turkish dusty city of Suruk, a few miles from the Syrian border
 syria kii seemaa par sthit cobain vahi shahar he jahaan baari narsanhaar or hajaaron logon ke palaayan ke baad oktober 2014 se hi iesas kaa kabja he
 Jemlin's family is also among the millions of Syrian refugees who have taken refuge in Turkey
 inamen se bahut se parivaar behad garib hai
 After 8 hours of hard work 6 days a week, Gemjin earns about 20 Turkish lira, which is less than $ 10 a week
 usne hamen bataaya ki use cobain main apane skool kii yaad aati he jahaan usne vigyaan, ganit or itihaas bhi siikhaa, haalanki vikalp kam hi the
 On the side of the road, in a small sewing shop we found a mosaic that is like Cobain's, and is no longer able to go to school
 13 saal ke mohammad ne ab ek nayaa kaam sikh liya he, vah ab pardon kii silaai karata he jo sthaneey bazaar main bikate hai
 Mohammed works for 8-10 hours every day and he gets the same amount of money as Gemjin
 paas hi main 13 saal kaa khalid mila, haalanki wo umr main thodaa bada lag rahaa tha
 Khalid has learned to operate an embroidery machine
 usne hamen bataaya ki vah pichley teen saal se is dukaan main kaam kar rahaa he yani usne 10 saal kii umr se hi kaam karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Due to his experience, Khalid earns more money, ie 20 to 50 lira a week
 khalid or baaki do hi akele nahin hai
 Cobain's children would be found everywhere in Suruk's markets, spending hours working hard for slave-like wages
 unke niyoktaaon kaa kahana he ki bacchon ko vaazib paise mil rahe hai
 Mohammad's employer said that Suruk is not a wealthy city and the money he is paying is sufficient
 lekin turki main nunatam mazdooree 1000 lira prati saptaah he or bacchon ko uskaa 2 fisadi bhi mushkil se hi mil paa rahaa he
 While child labor is illegal
 kuch bacchon ne hamen bataaya ki turki main syrian bacchon ke liye koi makul skool nahin he
 The medium of study is either Turkish language or English, children know Arabic so they do not understand Turkish or English
 suruk ke pados main hi ham khalid ke mata-pita se mili
 His story is extremely scary
 wo log syria ke rakka main rahete the
 IS was making Raqqa its capital before it took possession of Cobain
 khalid ke pita mustafa jo ki peshey se plumber hai, ne bataaya ki unke paas bete se kaam karwaane ke alaava koi chaara nahin tha
 For the work for which a Turkish plumber gets 700 lira, i only get 400 lira for the same work
 mustafa apane parivaar ko paalane ke liye jujh rahe hai
 The family consists of a wife and 4 children, Khalid being the eldest
 khalid ke chote bhai kii tishart kii ore ishaara karte hue unki maa ne bataaya ki ye tishart unhone use teen saal pehle syria se kharida tha
 He said, 'we are not able to buy new clothes
 ' Turkey has spent $ 7 billion on its behalf to care for about 2
5 million Syrian refugees
 syrian yuddh ne kareeb 40 lakh logon ko desh chhodane par majaboor kar diya he
 Only 10 per cent of the people are able to reach the western countries, while it is said that Europe is filled with refugees from Syria
 is baat se turki ko naaraazgi he
 Recognizing this inequality, there was a meeting of European leaders in Brussels last week to discuss the provision of more funds for the efforts being made by Turkey for Syrian refugees
 lekin nai dilli sthit south asian uniwarsity main padhaane vaali shabnam akapar kahati hai ki jitne bhi vaade kiye ja rahe hai wo hakeekat se dur hai
 He said that Turkey has so far received only $ 4,17000 from the international community
 khalid ke mata-pita or unke jaise duusare log europe tak pahunchane main samarth nahin hai
 When we traveled to the Syrian border in Cobain, we found that even those who are left will not be able to return to their homes in the near future
 shahar par ab phir se kurdon kaa niyantran he jo aies or bashar al asad kii sena se ek saath lard rahe hai, haalanki shahar kaa bada hissaa tabah ho chukaa he
 The comments khalid, mohammad or jemagin kii tarah hi teen saal kaa ylaan kurdi, pashchimi turki ke samudr tat par achet padaa vahi baccha jisaki tasviir ne duniya ko hilaa kar rakh diya tha, wo bhi cobain se hi tha
 His family had tried to take him away in the hope of a good life but his boat sank in the Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece
 par suruk ke bazaaron main hamane paaya ki sharnaarthiyon ke liye yahaan jivan aasaan nahin he, khaskar bacchon ke liye or bhi mushkil he
 We met a 12-year-old Gemjin in a city located at one end of a war-torn country
 syria kii seemaa se kuch mile kii duuri par sthit turki ke dhul bhare shahar suruk kii ek kapade kii dukaan main almariyon ko vyavasthit karata jemagin cobain kaa rahane vaala he
 Cobain, which is on the Syrian border, is the same city where ISIS has been in possession since October 2014, following heavy massacres and the exodus of thousands
 jemalin kaa parivaar bhi un lakhon syrian sharnaarthiyon main shaamil he jo turki main sharan liye hue hai
 Many of these families are extremely poor
 hafte main 6 din 8 ghante kii kadi mashkkat ke baad jemagin kareeb 20 turkish lira hi kama paata he yani hafte main 10 dollar se bhi kam
 He told us that he remembers his school at Cobain where he also learned science, mathematics and history, although the options were few
 sadak ke us taraf, ek choti si silaai dukaan main hamen mohammad mila, vah bhi jemagin kii tarah hi cobain kaa he or ab skool nahin ja paata
 The 13-year-old has now learned a new job; he now stitches the curtains that are sold in the local market
 mohammad har din 8-10 ghante kaam karata he or use bhi utane hi paise milte hai jitne jemagin ko
 a 13-year-old Khalid was found nearby, although he looked a bit older in age
 khalid ne ambroidari mashin chalaanaa sikh liya he
 He told us that he has been working in this shop for the last three years, that is, he started working from the age of 10
 apane anubhav ke chalate khalid kuch zyada paise kama letaa he, yani hafte main 20 se 50 lira tak
 Khalid and the other two are not alone
 suruk ke bazaaron main cobain ke bachche har taraf mil jaaenge, gulaamon jaisi mazdooree ke liye ghanton kadi mashkkat karte hue
 Their employers say that children are getting reasonable money
 mohammad ke niyokta ne bataaya ki suruk koi amir shahar to he nahin or wo jo paise de rahe hai wo paryaapt he
 But the minimum wage in Turkey is 1000 lira per week and children are hardly getting 2% of it
 jabaki bal mazdooree gaiyr kanoonee he
 Some children told us that there is no suitable school for Syrian children in Turkey
 padhai kaa madhyam yaa to turki bhashaa he yaa phir angreji, bacchon ko arabi aati he isliye wo turki yaa angreji samaj nahin pate
 It was in Suruk's neighborhood that we met Khalid's parents
 unki kahani behad daraavnee he
 They lived in Raqqa, Syria
 aies ne cobain par kabje se pehle rakka ko hi apni rajdhani bana rahaa tha
 Khalid's father Mustafa, a plumber by profession, said that he had no choice but to get his son to work
 jis kaam ke liye turki ke kisi plumber ko 700 lira milte hai, vahiin mujhe usee kaam ke liye keval 400 lira hi milte hai
 Mustafa is battling to raise his family
 parivaar main patni or 4 bachche hai jinamein khalid sabase bada he
 Pointing to Khalid's younger brother's t-shirt, his mother said that he had bought it from Syria three years ago
 unhone bataaya, 'ham nae kapade kharidne main samarth nahin hai
 ' turki ne apni taraf se kareeb 25 lakh syrian sharnaarthiyon kii dekharekh ke liye 7 arab dollar kharch kiye hai
 The Syrian war has forced about 4 million people to leave the country
 keval 10 fisadi log hi pashchimi deshon tak pahunch pate hai, jabaki ye kaha jaataa ki europe syria sharnaarthiyon se bhar gaya he
 Turkey is displeased with this
 asamanta kii is baat ko maanate hue pichley hafte brusselles main europe ke netaaon kii ek baithak hui jisamen syrian sharnaarthiyon ke liye turki dwaara kiye ja rahe prayaason ke liye zyada fund kii vyavastha karne par charchaa hui
 But Shabnam Akapar, who teaches at South Asian University in New Delhi, says that all the promises that are being made are far from reality
 unhone bataaya ki turki ko antarrashtriya samudaay se ab tak keval 4,17000 dollar hi praapt hue hai
 Khalid's parents and others like him are not able to reach Europe
 jab hamane cobain main syrian seemaa tak yatra kii to paaya ki jo log rah gaye hai wo bhi nikat bhavishya main apane gharon ko nahin laut sakenge
 The city is now again under the control of the Kurds who are fighting the IS and Bashar al Assad's forces together, although a large part of the city has been destroyed
 tippaniyan Like Khalid, Muhammad and Jemgin, the three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, a child who stunned the coast of western Turkey, whose picture shook the world, was also from Cobain
 uske parivaar ne acchhee jindagi kii ummid main use dur le jane kii koshish kii thi lekin uski naav turki or greece ke bich agian sagar main dub gai
 But in the markets of Suruk, we found that life is not easy for the refugees here, especially for the children
 jemalin kaa parivaar bhi un lakhon syrian sharnaarthiyon main shaamil he jo turki main sharan liye hue hai
 Many of these families are extremely poor
 hafte main 6 din 8 ghante kii kadi mashkkat ke baad jemagin kareeb 20 turkish lira hi kama paata he yani hafte main 10 dollar se bhi kam
