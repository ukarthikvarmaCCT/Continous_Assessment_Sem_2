 Even Dr
 baba sahib ambedkar ne bhi yaheen kaha tha
 The Sangh chief said that Sanskrit should be taught in such a way that everyone can learn it

 How close has been Mukul Roy to Mamta, how did he get away? Mukul Roy was the second-highest number after Mamata Banerjee in TMC

 Mukul gave a positive response during a five-hour inquiry by the CBI
 kaha jaataa he ki yaheen se mamata banerjee unase naaraaz ho gai thim, kyonki party kii line sibiai or centre sarkaar ke khilaaf thi
 Subsequently, in 2015, Mamata removed Mukul from the post of All India General Secretary of the party and also as the leader of the party in Rajya Sabha
 cheharaa mamata kaa, management roy kaa mukuladansal bengal kii siyasat menmamata banerjee ke liye mukul royakaphi ahm the
 While Mamata Banerjee is the face of TMC, Mukul Roy is considered an expert in electoral management
 bengal main tiemasi ke booth str tak kaa prabandhan ko sambhalate
 The electoral management of Mukul Roy was the reason behind Mamata's occupation of the throne of Bengal power
 mukul roy khaastaur se tiemasi ke sanghathanaatmak kshamta ke liye jane jate hai
 Mukul Roy is credited for the electoral success of the Trinamool Congress
 mamata banerjee ne bade paimaane par reliyon ke madhyam se logon tak pahunchane main mukul roy hi role play karte the
 Not only this, the public enthusiasm of the people of the state played its important role in turning votes
 booth level tak mukul kaa prabandhanmukul roy chunavi matdaan paddatiyon kii unki samaj, block or jila panchayaton ke saath unki sambandh ne vidhansabha chunaavon main tiemasi ko jamini bhaawanaaon ko majboot karne kaa kaam karte
 Mukul Roy knew which booth needed how many voters to win

 Workers used to take Mukul's name after Mamta
 abhi bhi tiemasi main netaaon kii lambii fouj to he par koi bhi mamata banerjee ke utana kareebi nahin he jitna mukul roy the
 How close Mamta's Mukul was can be gauged from the fact that she made Roy the railway minister at the center after taking resignation from Dinesh Trivedi
 aise main bijepi kaa daaman thamte hai, to assam ke hemanth viswa jaise sabit ho sakate hai
 Just as the BJP had mixed up Hemant Viswa of the Congress with Assam before the Assam elections, there is an ongoing exercise to link Mukul Roy with the party in Bengal

 Due to which property tax rates were changed
 haalanki ye north or south emsidi ko bhi lagu karnaa tha lekin donon hi nigamon ne ise lagu karne se manaa kar diya tha
 The East MCD had implemented the recommendations of the committee in view of the financial situation, but with the passing of the resolution on Thursday, BJP in the MCD alleged that the Delhi government had pressurized them to implement the recommendations of the committee before giving the funds
 This step had to be taken under compulsion
 haalanki is chhot par bhi sawaal uthte hai ki aarthik rup se badahaal east emsidi rajasav kahaan se jutaayegi
 The East MCD is the worst of the three corporations in Delhi, but instead of strictly implementing economic reforms, the MCD is refraining from implementing repeated property tax rates

 Suddenly he got the last ball over the wicket but the line did not change
 kowan sweep karne se chook gayi or gend turn lekar unki gilliyaan bikher gayi

 dhoni phir ek over ke liye aswin ko yaad kiya jinhone mathew vade (2) ko farward short leg par murali vijay ke haathon kaich karakar bharat ko paanchavin safalataa dilaayi
 Although it was not clear from the replay whether the ball was hit by the bat or not, umpire Aleem Dar had a different view

 krishna sobati (krishna Sobti) ke jaadui vyaktiv se meraa vaasta college ke dinon main padaa
 It was college fun and i was a BA (hons) student at Hansraj College
 akasar chaatro se milwane ke liye hindi ke sahityakaron ko bulaayaa jaataa tha or ek din aise hi jaadui vyaktitv vaali krishna sobati ko dekha
 Krishna Sobti was introduced to the students
 krishna sobati kii veshbhusha, hansata hua cheharaa or vah bindaasapan vaaki kamaal tha
 When she started speaking, i felt like listening to her for hours
 krishna sobati kii kahani 'sikaa badal gaya' skool ke dino main padhithi or uske kairactor shahni or shera jehan main rache-based the
 The suffering of Partition was the life of the story
 ab krishna sobati (krishna Sobti) ko paas se dekha or janaa to unke sahitya ko padhane kaa man kiya
 Then read 'friends Marjani'
 hindi sahitya main is tarah kaa damdaar kirdaar na to rachaa gaya tha or na hi ab tak rachaa gaya
 The courage and frivolity that was needed to create the character of Friends, was filled with codenamed Krishna Sobti
 is tarah krishna sobati kii kitabon se dosti kaa silsilaa badhata hi chalaa gaya
 'hum Hashmat', 'yaar ke yar tin pahad', 'zindaginama', 'sunflower of darkness', 'clouds of cloud', 'aye girl' and 'dar se bichhudi' read most of her books and thus Krishna Sobti's An image was created through his books
 hindi sahitya (hindi Literature) main krishna sobati (krishna Sobti) ek alag hi mukaam rakhti thim or unka vyaktitv unki kitabon jitna hi anokhaa tha
 This is from the days of India Today, and i was doing a story on the female Kamasutra subject of 'fifty Shades of Gray'
 aise main krishna sobati se is tarah kii kitabon ko lekar baat karne kaa man hua or sochaa unke kot bhi story main istemaal kar luungaa
 i called Krishna Sobti and as soon as she came on the phone all the memories of college days were refreshed
 unki aawaaj main vahi jindadilii kaayam thi
 i was afraid to talk to him on this bold subject, but as soon as i told him my topic, there was a child-like mischief in his voice
 maine poocha ki gandi kahi jane vaali kitaaben aapane apane bachapan ke dinon main padhi he to ve boli har koi padhata he
 But we read a few different books
 unhone bataaya ki 'ladi chatterlies lover (lady Chatterley's Lover)' jaisi kitaaben unhone us daur main padhi thim
 In such a long conversation, Krishna Sobti admitted that we lacked openness and described the Indian Mindset as a complex and said it does not want to see what it wants to do
 krishna sobati (krishna Sobti) se intervyuu ke liye milane kaa mauka to nahin mila
 But there was talk on the phone several times
 krishna sobati se aisi hi ek baatcheet us samay hui jab 2015 main puraskaar vaapasi kaa daur chalaa tha
 Writers of all languages were returning their awards due to protests due to intolerance
 is par bhi krishna sobati kii alag hi or bahut hi bebaak raay thi
 Krishna Sobti supported the return of the award and said that the author cannot take to the streets, the only way to oppose it is to return the honor it has received
 is tarah krishna sobati kaa belausapan yahaan bhi dikhaa
 But 24 days before his 94th birthday, Krishnaji left us
 1980 main krishna sobati ko unki kitaab 'jindginama' ke liye sahitya academy se nawaja gaya tha to 2017 main hindi sahitya main unke yogadan ke liye unhen gyanpith puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Krishna Sobti will always be among us with his literature

 His companions had gone to greet other areas
 tabhi kuchbadmashasadhu ke bhesh main haath main chimata or dholak bajaate hue darwaja khatkhataaye
 As soon as he opened the door, he entered the house directly inside
 pehle to unhone kinnar se pani maanga
 When she went inside to get water, during that time she hit her head with a blind object
 kinnar ne jab iskaa virodh karne kaa prayaas kiya to is dauraan badmaashon ne uske pet main chaaku maar diya
 After this, she fell unconscious

 is kolahal main kai ankahi kahaniyaan hothon par aa jaati hai
 An untold story Ankit Lal has narrated, through Facebook
 ankit aam aadmi party ke soshal media pramukh hai
 Before the Delhi elections, his team had plagued the BJP on social media
 lekin haal hi main ankit ko aam aadmi party ke fasebuk group kii adminship chhodani padi
 More than 1 lakh 32 thousand people are associated with this group
 haalia vivaad ke baadagrup par maahaul acha nahin tha or nakaaratmakataa se bachane ke liye ankit ne yah faisla kiya
 After this, he remembered his journey with the party with a hurt heart and wrote a letter to the workers
 chitthee kaa sandarbh itnaa ahm nahin he, jitna iskaa content he
 By reading this, you will come to know many new things about the Anna movement
 saath hi kaaryakartaaon kii najar se party banane kii prakriya, unke antardvandv se bhi nae sire se rubaru honge
 Ankit had written this letter in English, we are presenting its translation here
 aage unheen kii jubaani:ankit laal kii chitthiaaj main aapako ek kahani sunaauungaa
 The story which will tell how i left the administration of a Facebook page of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)
 yah vah jimmedaari thi, jo main kabhi uthaanaa nahin chahta tha
 But when i was found worth it, i could not escape
 or yah kahani thodi si badi hogi, plis bardaasht kijiega
 After completing btech in 2009, i started working as an ERP Consultant
 april 2011 main maine daftar se chuttee lee thi
 The motive was to once again give GRE (graduate Record Examination)
 2009 main bhi maine jiaarai kaa exam diya tha or meraa score 1290 tha
 i thought i could do better than this
 isliye naukari se chuttee lee
 But i could never give that test because a Facebook post of India Against Corruption (IAC) took me to Jantar Mantar
 main india against karpshan (iasi) se bataur walantier jud chukaa tha
 During this time i distributed water, spent nights in RML Hospital, taking care of the agitators and did all the work that 'activists' do
 mere manager ne fasebuk profile parandolan kii tasvirendekh chhuttiyaan radd kar deen
 It will be around April 20
 tab tak mujhe iasi ke oficial email kaa jawaab dene kaa kaam de diya gaya tha
 Our team had responded to about 12,000 emails in the month of April itself
 chhuttiyon se lautakar maine naukari join kii
 Then became part of Ghaziabad ground team (because my house is in Vaishali
 ) may se agast 2011 tak is ground team kaa netritv kiya
 Motive- Janlokpal !! Because i was leading the email team, so i used to have lots of pictures
 in tasveeron ko fasebuk pej par post karwaane ke makasad se main shivendra ke sampark main aayaa
 Shivendra was handling the Facebook page of the IAC
 mujhe IAC kii website kii jimmedaari bhi de di gai kyonki main unamem takneekee becoground kaa iklauta kaaryakarta tha
 Most of the work was online, that is, i could support the movement even while i was working
 15 agast ko (anna or kejariwal kii giraftaar se ek din pehle) main us 12 sadasyeey team kaa hissaa tha jo communication bakabon ke rup main kaam karne ke liye underground ho gai thi
 This was the idea of arvind Kejriwal, which was successful
 isane hamen hamaare plan main banaae rakhaa
 i asked for 15 days leave from the office, but could not find it
 maine istife kii peshkash kar di
 Later the manager accepted to give me 10 days leave
 15 se 18 taarikh tak ham underground rahe, uske baad maine ramlila maidan main hi deraa daal liya
 Stayed there, ate and slept
 yahi vah samay tha jab maine IAC ke fasebuk pej ke liye bhi post likhni shuru kar di thi
 The movement was over
 maine naukari shuru kar di or phir aage kii padhai kii taiyaariyon main jute gaya
 Then the December agitation took place and failed
 iske baad bahut kuch dhundhala ho gaya
 20 January 2012
 yah wo taarikh thi jab mujhe arvind kejariwal kaa bulaava aayaa
 He offered to leave my job and join my NGO PCRF
 enjio ke sadsy ke naate mujhe 20 hajaar rupee har maheene kaa stypend ofer kiya gaya, jo meri pichhali selary se kaaphi kam tha
 Kejriwal also used to get the same stipend from ngos
 22 janvari ko maine naukari chhod di or agle din unke enjio se jud gaya
 Around this time, Dilip Pandey had also left India to join Kejriwal
 farvari main MS ke liye meri aplicoshan neujersey institute of technolji main sweekaar kar lee gai
 There was confusion for me back then
 lekin maine yaheen ruknaa tay kiya
 Shortly afterwards i got married to a girl
 usase main IAC main hi mila tha
 Both these tasks were done without informing the family
 main ab bhi IAC kaa soshal media manage kar rahaa tha
 But in April, Shivendra retained all the rights of the IAC
 ab hamen sab kuch jiro se shuru karnaa tha
 After that i created FWAC and started building a new team
 phir main us team kaa hissaa bana jisane un 15 mantriyon ke khilaaf research kii, jinke khilaaf kejariwal july-agast 2012 main anshan par baithe
 Only after this, differences began to emerge between the leaders of the movement
 samasyaon ke hal ke liye arvind jo muhim chalaa rahe the, main unase judaa rahaa, kyonki main yahi sapana lekar aayaa tha
 In September 2012, when it came to creating a new political party, we started building our social media team afresh
 sudhir, ujjwal, pranav or bahut saare log isse jude
 We created more than 800 Facebook pages from national to state and district levels and started everything from zero likes
 yah group bhi usee samay somu ne banaaya tha
 When the party was formed in November, the National Executive (NE) officially handed me the command of social media
 ek badi duvidha party ke launch (26 november) se pehle munh baae mere saamne khadi thi
 Most of the people working in PCRF with stipend were now joining the party office as an employee
 offis bvoy ko milakar inaki sankhya 17 thi
 Since these people were employees, they could not be part of the party
 asamanjas yah tha ki main apana kariyar chhod chukaa tha, jahaan main apni jarurat se kaaphi jyada kama saktaa tha or ab ye 20 hajaar rupee maheene kii choti si rakam mere sapane ke aade aa rahi thi
 i decided maine party se judane ke liye pisiaref se istipha de diya
 In this way i became a member of the National Council of the party
 november 2012 se farvari 2014 tak meraa ghar patni kii kamai se hi chalaa jo ek media house main naukari karti thi
 It was a difficult time, but slowly passed
 phir santosh (coli) ke accident kii khabar ai to main hairaan rah gaya
 i stayed with him in the hospital for 5-6 days
 us sadame se ubharne main mujhe kuch samay laga, tab tak soshal media kii haalat bighad chuki thi
 Such groups were formed which were openly abusing each other
 ek-duusare par prahaar or vyaktitv par coment kiye ja rahe the or yah sab kuch logon kii vajah se ho rahaa tha
 These people include those 'doctors' who are very active nowadays
 hamane team bhang kar di or ise dobaaraa bananaa shuru kiya
 People like Pankaj, Pratyush, Aarti, Malay and Mahendra were brought into it
 kareeb do saalon se yah team 'war mashin' kii tarah kaam kar rahi he
 The challenge we presented for the BJP in 2013 and 2015 elections, no party could do before this
 charanjit, arshi or abhinav hamaare ahm yoddhaon main se the, jinhone apane din or raaten AAP ke soshal media ko samarpit kar die
 After the Lok Sabha elections, i started my social media business
 lekin iske shuru hone se pehle hi mujhe party kii ore se bula liya gaya
 Then my friends came forward
 unke udhaar ke paison se meraa ghar chalaa
 i hope that with my new start, i will return his money very soon
 is team ne BAAP, avam or bijepi se ladaai ladi he or unhen haraaya he
 It can overcome every challenge that comes its way
 main bas yahi sunishchit karuunga
 i will separate from the responsibility of social media of this group
 main bhi apni jindagi or parivaar ke liye kuch samay chahta hum
 i hope one day i will be worth it too
 tab tak, main kaam karata rahoonga, is baat kii parvaah kiye bagaiyr ki koun kya kah rahaa he!(iske baad ankit ne AAP ke fasebuk group kii adminship chhod di
 He is still the party's social media administrator and handles the rest of the page
 haalia prashanth bhushan-yogendra yadav vivaad par unki raay he ki koi bhi shaks jisane party ko jaanboojhkar nuksaan pahunchane kii koshish kii ho, use baahar kaa rasta dikhaaya janaa chahie

 Director of Government Post Graduate Medical College SSKM of West Bengal, Dr
 pradeep mitra ne apane walentary ritairement kii peshkash kii he
 Mitra alleges that he was not only transferred without any concrete reason but was also humiliated for stopping dialysis of a dog
 maamla jitna dilachasp he, utana hi durbhagyapurna bhi
 Because the Delhi government implemented ESMA considering the profession as necessary for the society, the same profession was given by Trinamool Congress leader Dr
 nirmal majhi kii raajnneetik shakti ne ghutane techne par majaboor kar diya
 Nirmal Majhi is the head of the State Medical Council and on 10 June the dog who came to the hospital for dialysis also belonged to Netaji
 dow
 Perhaps the biggest mistake in Mitra's life is that he does not know the practical meaning of VIP culture
 doctor sahab ko samajhnaa chahie tha ki netaji viipi hai to unka pyaara dogi bhi utana hi rasukhwala hoga
 Apparently the discussion of the matter got wings when the media started talking
 tab samay rahete aadarneey netaji ne kaha, 'vah ek pyaara kutta he or takalif main he to uskaailaajakyon na ho?'yah vaazib bhi he, kyonki aspataal main suvidha nahin hone ke kaaran janata bhale takalif sah le, netaji kaa kutta kyon sahe
 And then Dr
 mitra ne blendar karte hue kaaran bhi to yahi bataaya ki aspataal main jaanwaron ke dialasis kii suvidha nahin he
 
 
 
 or palat gaye netaa jivaise, maamle ne jor pakadaa to netaji majhi kii pakad dhili padane lagi
 When he was questioned again in the case, he overcame the dog
 nirmal majhi ne kaha, ‘meraa kisi kute se koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 This news is being spread to discredit me
 'kya hua tha tababataya jaataa he ki 10 june ko jab biimaar kute khospatalalaya gaya tha, tab nefrology vibhaag ke pramukh dow
 The dog was hospitalized after being ordered over Rajan Pandey's phone
 dow
 Pandey gave Dr
 mitra ko esemes bheja, jisamen likhaa tha, 'viipi kute ko dialysis kii jarurat he
 'dr
 mitra ke mutabik, ‘iske tunrat baad aspataal kii senior nefrologist dow
 Arpita Roy Chaudhary approached her for dog dialysis
 dow
 Mitra said, 'I immediately ordered it to stop and asked on whose orders it is being done
 tab mujhe bataaya gaya ki ye vibhaagadhyaksh ke aadesh par kiya ja rahaa he or log book main bhi registerd he
 'in the hospital's log book, in the number 13 on the date of June 10, there is a mention of the entry of' one unnamed dog '
 dow
 On June 23, 13 days after Mitra's transfer incident, Dr
 mitra kaa transfar kar diya gaya
 However, according to Health Ministry officials, it is a routine transfer, but Drs
 mitra kaa kahana he ki wo 33 saal se health sarvice main hai or is tarah kaa transfar hona saamaanya nahin he
 Under the CM, the Ministry of Health, Pradip Mitra has served as the director of SSKM for seven years
 unhone sarkaar se is maamle kii jaanch kii maang kii he, lekin ab tak koi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya
 When Mitra was asked why he did not complain about the matter to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, he said, "this transfer order could not have come without his consent
" ' pashchim bengal main swasthya mantralay siem mamata banerjee ke hi paas he

If these bowlers are constantly wandering their direction, then what is bowling coach Bharat Arun doing? Does any bowler accept anyone's advice or do the same to defraud everyone, and what team director Ravi Shastri is doing there amid all the ups and downs? aankade agar puri kahani bayaan nahin karte to jhooth bhi nahin bolte

 As he went to England, The

 The truth is that the bowlers of India do not know how to bowl in a Test match, because they have not played domestic cricket for many years
 team india main inaki jagah pakki hi he, kyonki ye captain dhoni ke chune hue hai
 That is, neither they themselves are troubled by their poor performance, nor the captain

 trump ke haal hi main liye gaye faislon ke saath saath unke vyavhaar, haav bhav or raashtrapati banane se pehle un par lage aaropon ko aksar charchaa main ghaseet liya jaataa he
 It would not be wrong to say that America is still in full swing in the world, but this time for different reasons
 aae din trump kaa koi na koi chaunkaa dene vaala bayaan saamne aata he jiske baad soshal media par unase jude chutkule or mim kaa tantaa lag jaataa he
 For example, on Saturday, another statement of Trump has come, in which he has described the media as America's biggest 'enemy'
 aise hi ek viral video kii kadi in dinon internet par hangaamaa machaa rahi he jisamen 'mistar president' se kaha ja rahaa he ki america number van he or rahegaa
 But at number two there can be no one but us
 yah tanj kasate hue video duniya ke alag alag deshon main banaae ja rahe hai jisamen america kii 'mahanata' ko bina shart sweekaar kiya ja rahaa he, or bataaya ja rahaa he ki america se sab 'kitna kitna kitna' pyaar karte hai
 This attempt to become a 'favorite' of the US is (obviously sarcastically) done by videos made in every country from Turkey, China, Iran, Japan, Israel, Russia to India
 bharat main bhi is tarj par teen chaar video bane hai jisamen bataaya ja rahaa he ki kyon bharat duusare number par rahakar khush he
 For example, a video made by Mumbai's Superfly company was uploaded on 14 February and has been viewed over 3 lakh times so far
 tippaniyan In the video, Trump's voice is mimicked to describe how India is at number two in everything, whether it is about population or whether to win the silver medal in the Olympics
 iske saath hi video main trump par un baton ko lekar kataaksh kiya gaya he jiske liye vah vivaadon main ghire rahe
 Not only this, the presence of Indians in every region of America has also been pinched, be it the CEO position of American software companies or Priyanka Chopra instead of Pamela Anderson in Baywatch
 is video banane vaali company ne 'taang khichaain' main trump ko kahin nahin choda, vahiin bharat kii badhati jansankhya par bhibad chadhakar tippanee kar daali
 At the end of the video, America was requested that 'hey America you are number one, but we are at number two because no one loves you as much as we do
 ' The link of one such viral video is creating uproar on the internet these days, in which Mr
 President is being told that America is number one and will remain
 lekin number do parahamare alaava koi or nahin ho saktaa
 These taunting videos are being made in different countries of the world, in which the 'greatness' of America is being unconditionally accepted, and it is being told that everyone loves 'how much how much' of America
 america kaa 'fevorett' banane kii yah koshish (zaahir he vyangyatmak rup se) turki, china, iran, japan, israel, rus se lekar bharattak har desh main banaae gaye video dwaara kii ja rahi he
 In India too, three to four videos have been made on this pattern, which explains why India is happy to be at number two
 masalan mubani kii souparaflaay company kaa banaaya video jise 14 farvari ko aplod kiya gaya or ise abhi tak 3 lakh se zyada baar dekha ja chukaa he
 The comments video main trump kii awaz kii bakhubi nakal karte hue bataaya gaya he ki kis tarah bharat har baat main number do par he, phir wo jansankhya kii baat ho yaa phir olympix main silver medal jeetne kii
 Along with this, the video has been trumped on Trump for those things for which he was surrounded in controversies
 yahi nahin, america ke har kshetra main bharatiyon kii upasthiti ko lekar bhi chutki lee gai he, phir vah america software companiyon ke siio pad ho yaa phir bewaach main pamela anderson kii jagah priyanka chopra ho
 The company making this video did not leave the trump in 'tang Khichai', while also commenting on the growing population of India
 video ke ant main america se yah nivedan kiya gaya ki 'he america aap number van hai, lekin number do par ham hai kyonki hamaare jitna pyaar aapse koi nahin karata

 The supreme court of the country has also asked the government to form a Uniform Civil Code, but the citizens of the country have not yet received a Uniform Civil Code

 Goa is the only state in India which has a uniform civil code
 bhartiya samvidhan main goa ko vishesh rajya kaa darja mila hua he
 Simultaneously, the Parliament enacted a law giving Goa the right to enforce the Portuguese Civil Code
 yah civil code aaj bhi goa main lagu he
 It is also known as Goa Civil Code
 aapako bataa den ki goa saal 1961 main bharat main shaamil hua tha
 Goa has a family law for all religions and castes, including Hindus, Muslims and Christians
 iskaa matlab yah he ki goa main shaadi, talaak or uttaradhikaar ke kanoon hindu, muslim or isai sabhi ke liye ek samaan hai
 In Goa, no Muslim has the right to divorce his wife by speaking thrice
 registration hone ke baad kanoonee taur par maanya hoti he shaadigova main muslim, hindu or isai samudaay ke logon ko apane dharm ke reeti rivaaj ke mutabik shaadi karne kaa haq he, lekin shaadi tabhi kanoonee taur par maanya hogi, jab uskaa registration karaayaa jayega
 If the marriage is registered once in Goa, then divorce is obtained only by the court
 maan lijie ki agar kisi muslim danpati kii shaadi kaa goa main registration karaayaa jaataa he, to unako talaak ke liye court janaa hoga
 No Muslim can divorce his wife by speaking
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki goa main muslimon ke liye alag se personal lau nahin he
 Similarly, people of Hindu and Christian community can also get married according to their customs, but marriage is valid only after registration
 iske baad agar kisi kaaran se talaak kii naubat aati he, to court janaa hota he
 In Goa, no one can divorce someone without the permission of the court
 mahila or purush ko sampatti par milte hai samaan adhikaraisi tarah goa main sabhi dharm ke pati-patni ko shaadi ke pehle or shaadi ke baad sampatti par samaan adhikaar milte hai

 aapke smartphone kii parformens gir rahi he? slo hone kii samasya he yaa hang ho rahaa he? isaki kai vajahen hai
 The biggest reason of these is also that there are many such apps in your phone that make you slow down the phone in another way
 kai eps aise bhi hai jo mobile kii speed badhaane kaa daawa karte hai, lekin asal main vahi aapke phone ko slo karte hai
 Therefore, there is a need to remove those apps from your mobile which are unnecessary for you
 ram boosterkai eps daawa karte hai ki wo memory clear karke ram boost karte hai or aapke smartphone kii speed bad jaati he
 Actually those apps kill the processes and apps running in the background
 lekin wo baar baar reestart hote hai aise main aapke phone kaa process ansteble hota he
 The Android smartphone has a default RAM manager, which works to boost RAM, for this you do not need third party apps
 clining eps jaise clin masterclin master ap android ke liye kaaphi popular he
 It is true that clearing the cache memory and junk files of the smartphone increases the speed
 lekin iske liye aapako kisi third party eps kii jarurat nahin he
 This option has already been given in Android
 iske liye aapako settings main ja kar storage par tap karnaa he yahaan Cached Data par clic karke Clear Cached data karnaa he
 Apart from this, you can delete the data of every app by going into settings
 isaki jagah agar koi ap install karenge to wo aapke smartphone ko slo karegaa, bydaree kii khapat karegaa or vigyaapan kii vajah se bhi aapaki privesi prabhavit ho sakati he
 Battery Saver Apps Battery Saver Apps also claim that they work to save the battery of your smartphone
 lekin kai baar ulta hota he, unase bydaree kii khapat zyada hoti he
 There are many ways to increase battery life, for which you do not need any apps
 simple tricks hai – britaness kam kar len, bluetooth wifai band kar len, becoground main chalane vaale eps ko band kar den, krom or massenger ko bhi settings main ja kar band kar len to aise hi aapaki bydaree seaving ho jaaegi
 By going into Android settings, you can first see which app is consuming how much battery and accordingly you should turn them off
 paisa kamaane vaale sarveyce besd apsple storeper aise eps kii bharmaar he jo daawa karte hai ki mahaj kuch chand clic se aap paise kama sakate hai
 You cannot earn money, but in this affair your smartphone may be hacked or slowed down
 aise eps survey karne ko kehete hai or iske liye aapako paise dene kaa daawa karte hai
 These surveys are very long and tedious
 lekin inkaa torget bas aapke smartphone main install hona hota he
 So avoid such apps
 fasebuk or massengerye do eps aapke smartphone kii bydaree or data jam kar khapat karte hai
 Whether you use them or not, the battery will be consumed
 kam hogi, lekin hogi
 You can see for yourself
 aap soshal media edict nahin hai to broujar ke jariye fasebuk yuj kar sakate hai
 But if you are a social media addict then there are many options for you

 lekin police ne badi mushkil se unhen roka hua he
 They do not even know where these students want to go
 bas wo aage badhate rahanaa chaahate hai
 Perhaps they hope that by moving forward, they will reach that system, which did not listen to them
 aapako bataa den kisishshchh parikshawon ke paper likehone ke baad chaatr kai dinon tak dilli ke CGO main sthit SSC ke mukhyalay ke baahar baithe rahe the
 But nobody listened to them
 harkar inhen apana pradarshan tab khatm karnaa padaa tha
 It was then that he announced that students from all over the country would gather in Delhi on 31 March
 aaj subah se hi chaatr pehle dilli ke sansad maarg par pahunche
 He does not have a single leader
 sab alag-alag rajyon se hai
 Because of this, it is difficult for the police to control them and for some people who are leading them
 dopaher ke 1
 It is 30 o'clock
 sansad maarg par ek manch he, us par kuch log mike se kah rahe hai baith jaaie, hamane wireles se grahamantri ji ko sandesh bheja he
 They give them an hour's time
 agar koi jawaab nahin aayaa to sab milakar tay karenge ki kya karnaa he
 Police officers have gathered near the platform
 badi sankhya main police ke jawan bhi upasthit hai
 When the students sitting in the sun for the last several hours heard this announcement, they became furious
 jab tak koi kuch samaj paata, tab tak chaatro kaa ek jattha apni jagah se uthaa or conot place kii taraf daudane laga
 Police officers, jawans and media persons also fled
 dekhte hi dekhte manch ke saamne baithe adhiktar ladke us taraf bhaagane lage
 Nothing is understood by the police officers
 asal main kisi ke samaj main kuch nahin aa rahaa he
 The students who are running do not even know where they are going
 Why are they going? Actually, it happened when they heard that for an hour and then the power to wait for them was answered
 samaj nahin aa rahaa ki yahaan se thodi dur par tamaam mantriyon ke awaas hai, daphtar hai phir bhi koi inke bich kyon nahin aa rahaa? inase do shabd kyon nahin kah rahaa
 i claim that if even a representative of the government had come to Delhi's Parliament Street and listened to them, it would not have been what happened at Delhi's Janpath for many hours
 pehali baar maine dikhaa ki dilli police ke tamaam adhikari baar-baar chaatro se baat kar rahe hai
 He is facing his anger while remaining silent and is advising his soldiers to do the same
 wo baar-baar phone or wireles se baat bhi kar rahe hai, lekin aisa lag rahaa he ki wo bhi in pradarshnkaree chaatro kii tarah asahaay hai
 All the boys and girls sitting calmly on Parliament Street came to Delhi's Janpath by 3 o'clock
 baar-baar police orchaatrapas main bhid rahe hai
 If the policemen use even a slight force, the students say in one voice: Shoot 


 After this the policemen start behaving a little
 asal main police ko aage karne se yah maamla haal hone vaala to he hi nahin
 Students are looking for their ministers, they should come forward, but their anger is on the seventh sky because of their absence
 yahaan yah khaastaur par bataanaa zaruri he ki pradarshnkaree gusse main hai, niraash hai lekin wo kisi bhi tarah kii hinsa nahin kar rahe hai
 It seems that initially the police thought that they would be exhausted themselves
 ek pal ko laga bhi
 The crowd is beginning to wither
 janpath puri tarah se band he kyonki kuch chaatr sadak par hi baithe hai
 But once upon a time, once again the students gathered from all sides and the police stood in front of them as a wall
 chaatr us diwaar ko thodaa hataakar aage bad janaa chaahate hai, lekin is baar police ne unhen khadedna shuru kar diya he
 Sticks charged
 chaatr-chaatro ko pakadakar bason main bithaaya ja rahaa he
 Students are running
 kisi kii chappal to kisi kii kalam sadak par hi chhot gai he
 Ultimately, the police officers took the same route that they take to end every protest
 police lathicharge main ek chaatr kaa sar phuta or kaiyon ke hausale post hue
 The future of the country is being banished on the streets of Delhi
 peeta ja rahaa he
 The future is running away
 police unhen bhaga rahi he
 Common passers by both sides of Janpath are taking pictures
 video bana rahe hai

 On Monday, this party had a meeting with the common people, but on Tuesday, special people are going to churn to reach the common people
 kejariwal party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii mangalvaar ko baithak hogi

 But, Arvind Kejriwal has also given the name of common man to his political enemies
 sabakuch siyaasi partiyon jaisaa hi, vahi narebaaji, vahi shor-sharaaba, vahi dhol-dhamaakaa
 But, in this party of the common man too, there is a view of big and small
 kejariwal kii team ne khud hi tay kar liya he ki desh kaa sabase bada aam aadmi arvind kejariwal hi hai
 Well, in politics such jumlas are thrown
 to naukarshah se siyasatdan bane arvind kejariwal bhi manch se siyaasi baan chhodana nahin bhuule
 There were arrows for every party in the quiver
 aam aadmi party khadi ho gai
 The lights were on, the camera was on, the action was fierce
 party ko chalaane ke naam par charity bhi hui
 Senior advocate Shanti Bhushan donated 1 crore
 kumaar vishwaas ne party daftar ke liye apana ghar daan kar diya
 Many of the supporters also assured to open a party office in their house, some heartily pledged to take forward the Aam Aadmi Party
 somvaar ko party kii pehali raily hui, jamkar bheed juty to party netaaon ke hausale buland ho gaye
 Workers equipped with cap of common man also gave strength to Kejriwal
 vaise to party main adhyaksh or upaadhyaksh jaise pad nahin hai
 Nevertheless, rules and regulations have been made for the operation, under which the Aam Aadmi Party will have no president, vice-president, the 30-member national executive will be responsible for the party and Arvind Kejriwal will be the party's national convenor
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jang ke naam par nai siyasat kii dasha or disha kya hogi, ye mangalvaar ko hi tay kiya janaa he
 Will Congress or BJP be the target
 donon par nishaanaa sadhakar party aage kaise badhegi
 There are all issues and Kejriwal and the party have to take a decision on all these
 siyasat ke samar main kejariwal kya tir maarenge, ye to aane vaale din hi bataaenge

 The honest image of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is proving to be meaningless in front of these scams
 congress ke ranneetikaar maan rahe hai ki sthiti se ubarne ke liye kuch to karnaa hi padegaa
 Janardan Dwivedi, party general secretary who prepared Sonia's speech, admits, "there should be some radical changes in the party line over time
" '' magar kya? ye puche jane par ve chuppi saadh gaye
 But one party MP believes, "the worker is leaving the party
" vah poochta he ki us party ke liye kyon raat-din ek kare jisaki rashtriya adhyaksh or rashtriya mahasachiv se mulaakaat hi nahin ho paati
 "there has been a deepening of the realization among the activists that from time to time the party and the state are entrusted with a number of party leaders
 masalan, gahalot rajasthan ke chunaavon main koi karishma na kar paae to sanghathan main mahasachiv bana die gaye

 For this, the professors of Pune-based Symbiosis have been contacted
 iske alaava, harsh mandar, aruna roy or jo dreje bhi raay denge ki party kii din-ba-din girti chhavi kaise sudhari jaae
 The party will also invite election analysts like Yogendra Yadav who will share their experiences with party workers and give them success spells
 vaise, mahadhiveshan main congress ke prastaav aam aadmi ke hiton se jude honge
 Its entire focus will be on corruption, inflation and employment
 aatm-manthan hoga ki aam aadmi ko haath ke saath kaise laayaa jaae
 Party spokesperson Manish Tiwari says, "there will also be talk on what should be done to protect the interest of the common man in the convention
" ''congress kaa pichhlaa mahadhiveshan 2006 main hyderabad main hua tha
 Even then several political, economic and foreign policy proposals were passed
 lekin ek-do muddon ko chhodkar vah kuch nahin kar pai
 On proposals like center-state relations, electoral reforms, land reforms, women empowerment, minority welfare, she could not move even a step
 aantarik suraksha kii sthiti or kashmir tathaa purvottar rajyon kii sthiti main bhi sudhaar karne main vah vifal rahi
 Apart from this, she could not fulfill the promise of employment in the economic proposals
 indira awaas yojana, vidhwaa pension yojana kii durgati jagajaahir he
 Most of the proposals were reduced to papers
 yahi nahin, 2003 main shimla adhiveshan main sonia gandhi ne hi nae congressi rangaruton ke liye congress training academy banane kaa prastaav rakhaa tha jiskaa astitv aaj tak kaagaj par bhi nahin ban paaya

 More information is awaited
 sthiti puri saaf nahin he, lekin jo tasviren saamne aa rahi hai, unhen dekhakar yah bharose se kaha ja saktaa he, yah railway trek ke baith jane se hua haadasa he
 Had a track been damaged, there would have been an accident, two railway accidents at the same point indicate that the flow of water hollowed the ground of the railway track, and then within a few moments, the ground slid under the wheels of the coaches
 Has gone
 itarasi main rail root riley interloking system ko dobaaraa shuru karke railway ne raahat ke kuch din hi gujaarey the or is ek or haadase ne nayaa sankat khadaa kar diya
 During the Itarsi accident, for the first time in the history of the railway, more than a thousand trains had to be canceled
 arabon kaa nuksaan hua
 Thankfully, there was no loss of life in it, but about 100 km from Itarsi station, the accident has once again brought many questions to the fore
 is haadase ko samajhane ke liye aapako us jagah ke bare main bhi samajhnaa hoga
 You will remember the city of Harsud
 harsood shahar tak jane ke liye pehle alag rail line hua karti thi
 This railway line was laid in the British era
 indira sagar baandh banane se harsood shahar to duba hi, vah rail line bhi dub gai
 After this a new railway line was laid here
 main is rail line par bachapan se safar karte rahaa hum, harsood main apane mamaa ke ghar jane ke chalate
 Harsud is gone even after being displaced from the new railway line
 barish ke mausam main yahaan par jalairao kii badi—badi sanrachanaayen bhi dekhi hai
 The distance around the Kalimachak River passes in front of the eye in moments, after the dam is built, it is difficult to understand for long distances where the river is
 nadi ek kism ke bade talab main tabdeel ho jaati he
 You will also see such scenes if you ever go through this rail route
 mujhe lagata he isi pani ne to kahin is line ko khokhla na kar diya ho, kyonki pani nai jameen par nae raste khojataa he, uski apni gati he, apana rasta he
 Information is also coming that the dam water was released, or filled
 pushti honi baaki he, lekin mujhe sitambar 1999 kii narmada kii baadh jarur yaad aati he
 In this flood too, Narmada was stuck on one bank of river for four days
 yah baadh jitani barish se nahin ai thi, usase adhik is kaaran se ai thi ki jabalpur ke bargi baandh, barna baandh or hoshangabad ke tawa baandh se ek saath pani chhod diya gaya
 It was devastated by floods in the submergence area for five to six days
 tippaniyan Now that the entire Narmada river has been converted into small reservoirs by constructing large dams everywhere, the effect of changes in geographical structures can also be seen

 The railways had spent a few days of relief by restarting the rail route relay interlocking system in Itarsi and another incident created a new crisis
 itarasi haadase ke dauraan railway ke itihaas main pehali baar hajaar se zyada railgadiyon ko radd karnaa padaa
 There was a loss of billions
 shukr yah tha ki usamen koi janahani nahin hui, lekin itarasi stesan se takreeban 100 kimi kii duuri par haadase ne ek baar phir kai sawaalon ko saamne laa khadaa kiya he
 To understand this incident, you also have to understand about that place
 aapako yaad hoga harsood shahar
 There used to be a separate railway line to reach the city of Harsud
 yah rail line angrejon ke jamaane main daali gai thi
 With the construction of Indira Sagar Dam, Harsud city was submerged, that railway line also sank
 iske baad yahaan ek nai rail line bichaai gai
 i have been traveling on this railway line since childhood, on my way to my maternal uncle's house in Harsud
 harsood visthapit hone ke baad bhi gaya hum, nayi rail line se
 During the rainy season, large structures of waterlogging have also been seen here
 jis kalimachak nadi ke aasapaas kaa kinaaraa palon main najar ke saamne se guzar jaataa tha, baandh banane ke baad lambii duuri tak yah samaj paanaa mushkil hota he ki nadi kahaan he

 i think that this water has not made this line hollow, because water finds new paths on new land, it has its own speed, its own path
 suchanaaen yah bhi aa rahi hai ki baandh kaa pani choda gaya, yaa bhar gaya
 Confirmation remains, but i do remember the Narmada floods of September 1999
 is baadh main bhi chaar dinon tak narmada nadi ke ek kinare par fansaa rahaa tha
 The floods did not come as much from the rains, because of the simultaneous release of water from the Bargi Dam in Jabalpur, Barna Dam and Tawa Dam in Hoshangabad

 harsood shahar tak jane ke liye pehle alag rail line hua karti thi
 This railway line was laid in the British era
 indira sagar baandh banane se harsood shahar to duba hi, vah rail line bhi dub gai
 After this a new railway line was laid here

 Harsud is gone even after being displaced from the new railway line
