 RTI documents from India Today have revealed that several criminal cases have been registered against Zain

 In such a situation, questions will arise again on why, despite the strict order of the court, why did the Akhilesh Yadav government make such a person who has the same allegations as the previous chairman

 In this, a report was lodged against another Sunil Jain and my address was mistakenly written

 In such a situation, the question is why the Agra Police is still calling them accused in this case

 "congress in-charge of Uttar Pradesh and party general secretary Digvijay said," When the results of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections come out on March 6, they (pawar) will be surprised
 ’ yah puche jane par kya rahul par pavaar ke bayaan ko vah nindaneey bhi maanate hai, digvijay ne sidhaa jawaab taalte hue kaha, ‘mujhe is maamle main jo kahana tha, vah main pehle hi kah chukaa hum
 ' agar aaj bharat kii jang kisi padosi mulk se saath ho jaae tobhartiya senasirf 20 dinon tak hi ladaai main tik paaegi
 Yes, we are not saying this, rather it has been revealed in a CAG report
 ek angreji akhbaar kii khabar ke mutabik, CAG kii is report ke mutabik bhartiya sena ke paas sirf 15 se 20 dinon kaa hi gola-barood maujuud he, jiske sahare wo jang lard sakati he
 Whereas Tejas, the indigenous jet fighter aircraft of the country's Air Force, is not yet ready for war
 CAG ke mutabik bharat kii thalsena ke paas kam se kam 40 dinon kaa waar rigerv hona chahie
 but it's not like that
 bhartiya sena ke paas yuddh ke liye istemaal kiye jane vaale jitne hathiyaar maujuud hai unase sirf 20 dinon kii hi ladaai ladi ja sakati he
 The CAG has said that all these have a very bad effect on operational training
 CAG ne raksha mantralay or ordinance factory board ke kaam par bhi sawaal uthaae hai
 The report said that the OFB was not able to provide sufficient amount of munitions to the army
 aapako bataa den ki offbi dwaara paryaapt maatra main gola barood supplai naa kiye jane kii surat main raksha mantralay ne gola-barood aayaat karne kii yojana banaai thi lekin iskaa bhi kuch khaas asar nahin ho rahaa he

 kumbhanagari prayagraj main dwarka-sharada peeth ke shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati kii aguwai main chali teen divasiy param dharm sansad ne buudhvaar ko dharmadesh jari kar ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke liye taarikh kaa elaan kar diya
 This order came a day before the Parliament of Religions, headed by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, in Prayagraj itself
 viechpi kii dharm sansad se pehle jari is dharmadesh se sadhu-santon ke bich ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar dharmayudh chhidane kii sambhaavna he
 The ordinance was issued after a detailed discussion about the Ram temple on the last day of the Supreme Dharma Parliament, which lasted for three days in Sector 9 of Shilanyasakumbhetra on 21 February
 shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati dwaara jari dharmadesh main kaha gaya he ki basant panchami ke snaan ke baad sant samaaj ayodhya ke liye kooch karegaa
 And on 21 February, the foundation stone of the Ram temple will be laid
 swami swaroopanand saraswati ne kaha ki ram mandir nirmaan ke balidaan dene kaa vakt aa gaya he
 With the court's decision still to be delayed, the Sant Samaj will peacefully march to Ayodhya under the Ramabhimani Civil Disobedience Movement
 agar unhen roka gaya to ve goli khaane se bhi peeche nahin hatenge
 VHP boli-mandir, we will build, reacting to the order of Religion Parliament headed by Shreshkaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, VHP International General Secretary Surendra Jain said in a conversation with 'aaj Tak' that the Religion Parliament raised the Ram Temple matter to the point that Today he is at centerstage, the meeting of that religion parliament is to be held today
 unhone poocha aakhir ve mandir nirmaan kahaan karenge? na unke paas jameen he or na hi ve kisi jameen ke adhikari hai
 They will not be able to do anything
 surendra jain ne kaha ki ram mandir nirmaan viechpi kii aguwai vaali dharm sansad hi karegi kyonki hamane iske liye sangharsh kiya he
 Jain feared conspiracy in the bogus issued by the Supreme Parliament
 sarkaar kaa SC ne ahm kadamgauratlab he ki mangalvaar ko centre sarkaar ne supreme court main mahatvapurn pahal karte hue ayodhya main vivaadit sthal ke aasapaas kii 67
 Appealed to return 390 acres of non-disputed landowners
 centre sarkaar ke is kadam kaa vishwa hindu parishad ne swaagat kiya
 Because it feels that before it can decide on the disputed site, at least the process of temple construction can be started in its vicinity
 lekin sarkaar ke is kadam ko shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati kii aguwai vaali dharmasansad ne dhyaan bhatakaane kii sajeesh qaraar diya
 Swami Avimukteshwarananda, the representative of Shankaracharya, said that the Ram temple is to be built only where Ramlala is seated, not around it
 jaahir he guuruuvaar se viechpi kii aguwai main shuru hone vaali dharm sansad main centre sarkaar ke kadam ke sangyaan main ram mandir nirmaan kii ranneeti par bhi charchaa hogi
 But one thing is certain that with the announcement of the date of construction of the temple in the Supreme Religion Parliament, before the vhp's Religion Parliament, the Sant Samaj has got torn apart
 ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar sant samaaj aaj hi nahin banta
 Even before this, a Dharm Sabha was organized under the leadership of VHP in Delhi, in which the government was issued a mandate to make a law for the construction of Ram temple
 do faad hua sant samajalekin is dharmasabha ke kuch hi din baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ke sansadeey kshetra kaashi main shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati kii aguwai main param dharmasansad kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 The central government was criticized for not taking proper steps to construct the temple in this religion
 jabaki mandir nirmaan ke liye andolnarat santon ke saath durvyavhaar kii bhartsana kii gai
 Now once again the same faction of saint society is face to face
 jisamen shankaracharya swaroopanand saraswati ne taarikh kaa elaan kar mandir nirmaan kii disha main ek badi lakeer khich di he
 Now it has to be seen that what kind of strategy the vhp-led Sant Samaj faction uses to answer this? kohli ne kaha, "film main sab kuch achche se samajhaayaa gaya he
 These three films will also be good for people to watch and learn

 No lesson
 The two fidayeen groups that attacked the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot on January 2 crossed the border near Bamiyal, a small town in Punjab
 is jagah kaa istemaal drug taskar or aatanki pehle se ghuspaith ke liye karte rahe hai
 The paths recorded in the GPS device recovered from the suicide squad of three terrorists who attacked the Dinanagar police station in Gurdaspur on 27 July 2015, six months ago , suggest that they too had chosen the same route to enter India
 jaahir he, dinanagar kii ghatana se na to seemaa suraksha bal or na hi punjab police ne koi sabak siikhaa tha
 Though the Punjab Police had stepped up security immediately after the attack on the police station, a few select officers were stationed at remote border stations like Narot Jaimal Singh and units of CPMF (central Paramilitary Force) and State Police Forces, including the National Highways, in rural areas
 Night patrolling was also increased on the streets
 yah sab kuch haalanki teen maheene se zyada nahin tik paaya tha
 After October, patrolling was reduced and many officers managed to disengage from points where they viewed the deployment as punishment
 aaj agle aatanki hamale kii surat se khaufjada aalaa police adhikari sthaneey netaaon or taskaron ke narkotics giroh par ungali uthaa rahe hai jo bamiyaal jaise aasaan seemaa binduon ko khulaa rakhana chaahate hai
 Delayed response Gurdaspur Superintendent of Police (headquarters) Salvinder Singh telephoned several of his senior officers, including the police control room in Pathankot, on the morning of 1 January, informing him that four Pakistani terrorists wearing military uniforms had abducted him
 ve saamaanya taur se surakshakarmiyon ke bagaiyr baahar nahin nikalate the, lekin us vakt unke saath sirf unka rasoiyaa madan gopal or pathankot kaa ek johari rajesh kumaar maujuud the
 He claims that around midnight, the terrorists stopped his SUV outside the village of Kolian when he was returning from a local pilgrimage site
 salwinder ke mutabik, aatankwaadiyon ne johari ko apane saath car chalaane ke liye rakhaa jabaki unhen or rasoie ko chhod diya
 His instruction regarding the information of the fidayeen squad in the area should be seen in light of an intelligence report issued earlier on 30 December which was broadcast to all the districts of Punjab
 isamen khufia beuro kii ek report ke aadhaar par bamiyaal kshetra main sambhavit ghuspaith kii koshish kii chetavanee jari kii gai thi
 Despite this early warning, top Punjab Police officers did not trust Salvinder's story
 ek bade police adhikari kii maane to unka andeh salwinder ke oonche “ohade” ke chalate tha, jinke taskaron se sambandh hone kii (apusht) afvaahen chalati thim
 Barely 500 meters from the western wall of the IAF station outside Tajpur village, he was able to trust Salvinder's point only after his SUV was recovered and then a call from Rajesh
 rajesh ko aatankiyon ne gardan main chura maar diya tha or unhen mrit samajhakar chhod gaye the, lekin ve badi mushkil se ek nijee aspataal pahunchakar phone kar sake the
 By then, however, a lot of time was wasted
 airbase ko mahfuj rakhane kii naakamichaar fidaayin 1 janvari ko suryoday se pehle kisi vakt pathankot ke airbase main aasaani se ghusane main kaamyaab ho gaye the
 The next morning, when two other fidayeen came with him, at about three o'clock in the morning, his struggle with the Defense Security Corps personnel started
 yah sab kuch tab hua, jabaki unke aane or unki maarak manshaaon kii paryaapt soochna uplabdh thi
 Initially, after a lukewarm response, the Punjab police patrolled the residential areas late in the morning of 1 January and began investigating the villages along the 2,000-acre airbase
 swat (special vepans and tactics) tiimon ke sahyog se chalaae gaye is vyapak abhiyaan ko pakistaniyon kaa suraag nahin mil sakaa
 Local military units deployed to guard the airbase also failed to protect the perimeter of the airbase
 aisa lagata he ki adhiktar kaam diessi ke un santariyon ke jimme chhod diya gaya tha, jinamein adhed umr ke purv sainik shaamil hote hai jinhen airbase yaa anya sainya thikaanon par tainaat kiya jaataa he
 These were the first men to face Fidayeen, whose presence, according to a senior Air Force officer, had already been captured by helicopter-backed thermal imaging
 chaar din tak chale is sangharsh ke pehle din diessi ke chaar javaanon ke maare jane ke baad aatankiyon se nipatane ko bheje gaye vaayu sena ke ek garud commando ne 4 janvari ko india today se kaha, “hamaare paas mainpavar kii kami thi
 "the deployment of the NSG
 a few days before the Pathankot attack, the National Security Guard (NSG) was put on high alert
 enesji kaa 51 special acshan group (esaiji) jisamen sirf sanyakarmi hote hai, use haryana ke manesar sthit uske base se nikaalkar indira gandhi antarrashtriya hawaii adde ke bahari ilaake main sthit sudarshan complex main bhej diya gaya tha
 The complex is built after the 26 / 11 attack
 guptchar soochna thi ki dilli or aasapaas nae saal par hamale ho sakate hai
 Commandos in plain clothes were deployed to inspect the malls in South Delhi
 jab aatankiyon kii ghuspaith or unke airbase par hamalaa karne ke iraadon kii khabar mili, tab 1 janvari ko enesji kii do ikaayiyon 51 esaiji or 200 se zyada commando vaale 13 special rangers group ko vimaan se pathankot bheja gaya
 When the terrorists launched the attack on 2 January, it was clear that the nsg's election to run operations inside the Air Force Station was not right
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki enesji kaa prashikshan sankat kii sthiti se nibatane ke liye diya gaya he, na ki kisi airbase ko bachaana yaa aatankiyon ke pahunchane se pehle unki gheraabandi karnaa uskaa kaam he
 a large number of soldiers were needed to neutralize the terrorists in such a large area and the army infantry could do this work in a much more efficient manner
 lekin akele 1 para ko enesji kii madad ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 Lack of coordination Joint operation has always been a curse for Indian security agencies
 ye agenciyaan akele hi abhiyaan chalaane main suvidha mahasoos karti hai
 The same painful lesson was revealed during the 26 / 11 attack in Mumbai, when several agencies like Mumbai Police, CRPF, Marine Commando, Indian Army and NSG failed to deal with the terrorists in the early hours of the attack
 is samasya ko dur kiya ja saktaa tha, agar in sabhi balon kii kaman kisi ek adhikari ko de di jaati
 Nothing of this sort was done in Pathankot
 vahaan bhi vaayu sena, punjab police, sena or enesji ek saath kaam kar rahe the or harek agency apane-apane adhikari ke liye javabdeh thi
 In a press conference held in Pathankot on 5 January, Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, ignoring criticism over the command of the NSG, contended that more than 50 per cent of the force (SAJG) was full of military personnel
 unhone is baat kaa zikr nahin kiya ki enesji grih mantralay ke antargat aane vaala kendriya ardhasanya bal he jisaki kaman ek ipies afasar ke haath main hoti he
 Parrikar pointed out the lack of coordination, saying that the Army, Air Force and NSG needed to take "joint training"
 bahut jaldi “mishan puraa”suraksha balon ne 2 janvari kii raat ko chauthaa aatanki maare jane ke baad gafalat main maan liya tha ki abhiyaan puraa ho chukaa he
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh greeted security forces that evening to kill the "five terrorists", but soon deleted his tweet
 agali subah do anya aatankiyon kii golibari ne sanket kiya ki hamalaa abhi jari he
 The security forces now believe that two teams of terrorists had reached the Air Force base from different routes
 ek team ne surakshabalon ko jab fansaae rakhaa, us vakt duusari team aaraam kar rahi thi
 The other team opened fire the next day
 hamale kii yah style idhar ke varshon main pehali baar dekhne main ai jisane 2003 main us baari suraksha chook kii yaad dilaa di jab sena ke aalaa adhikari jammu main fidaayin aatankiyon ke ek hamale ke ghatnasthal par pahunche the
 They agreed that the operation had ended, but a suicide bomber was hiding
 usne golibari kar di jisamen ek brigadier maaraa gaya or sena ke uttari commander leftinent general hariprasad ghayal ho gaye the
 Death of NSG officer a tragic turn in Pathankot attack came on the afternoon of 3 January when Lt Col Niranjan Kumar, commanding officer of nsg's Bomb Disposal Company (BDC), was killed in a grenade blast
 is dhamaake main unki unit ke teen anya log jakhmi ho gaye
 The bomb is believed to have exploded when the officer was neutralizing the explosives brought by the terrorists
 unki maut se yah sawaal uth rahaa he ki kya yah kaam karne ke liye bal ke paas paryaapt saadhan maujuud the
 It is not yet clear whether the NSG bomb squad reached Pathankot from Delhi with all these security equipment or not

 Afzal Guru, accused of the attack on Parliament on December 13, 2001, was hanged in February 2013

 The attack on the Pathankot airbase has once again brought the role of Jaish to the center
 masood ajahar ko 31 disambar, 1999 ko qandahar main apahrit bhartiya vimaan isi 814 ke 177 yatriyon ke badale reeha kiya gaya tha
 At that time, he was only 31 years old
 usne 2000 main jeiem kii sthapana kii jisane bhartiya sansad par hamalaa kiya or bharat tathaa pakistan ko jang ke muhane par dhakel diya
 When its supporters attacked the then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in 2003, the organization was dormant

 They see a two-way strategy in it

 The earliest signs of the resurgence of the Jaish were found in 2014, when the Pakistani military interned the al-rahmat Trust, its affiliated social organization, after another zarb-e-azb military operation against the Pakistani Taliban in northwest Pakistan, including another organization
 Was tasked to rehabilitate the displaced people

 The rise of Jaish has not happened at the cost of Lashkar

 An official says that if the Pakistani army has 95 percent confidence in Lashkar, it is 75 percent on Jaish
 masood ajahar kabhi pakistani fouj kaa pasandida shaks hua karata tha lekin lashkar or uske sansthaapak hafiz said ke ubhaar ne uski kismat ko kamjor kar diya
 Its fighters are not as trained as the Lashkar and in recent years have suffered heavy losses in Jammu and Kashmir, especially in 2013 when several key Jaish terrorists were killed

 -input language dilli pradesh congress adhyaksh ke taur par purv mukhyamantri shila dikshit ne buudhvaar ko kaarybhaar sambhaal liya
 On this occasion, the presence of 1984 Sikh riots accused and former Congress MP Jagdish Tytler sparked controversy over Dixit's coronation
 shila dikshit ke padbhaar grahan karne ke kaarykram main titalar pehali pankti main baithe dikhe, jise lekar congress kii aalochana hone lagi ki party ne ek baar phir sikhon ke jakhmon par namak chhidakane kaa kaam kiya he
 Actually, during the tenure of former Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken, the State Congress had avoided Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar, accused of Sikh riots
 yahaan tak ki congress ke kaarykram main bhi in donon netaaon kii maujuudagi party ko ganvaara na thi
 On April 9, 2018, at a function of Delhi Pradesh Congress, before the arrival of Congress President Rahul Gandhi, the two leaders were alluded to leave
 haal hi main jab sikh danga maamle main sajjan kumaar ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai gai tab bhi party ne unase kinaaraa kar liya
 Now the Nizam has changed in Delhi Congress, then the neglected leaders in Congress also started appearing in the party office
 kendriya mantri harsimrat cor badal ne kaha ki 'rahul ji bhi vahi kar rahe hai jo unke parivaar ne kiya tha
 He has shown that he has no respect for the sentiments of Sikhs
 ' sajjan kumaar ko doshi qaraar die jane ke baad harsimrat cor badal ne kaha tha ki jald hi jagadish titalar ko bhi sajaa milegi
 In response to a question asked on Sajjan Kumar, Jagdish Tytler said that when the court has given the verdict, what can one say
 aapane meraa naam bhi liya, kyon ? kya koi FIR he? kya koi cese he? nahin? tab aap meraa naam kyon lete hai? kisi ne kaha, or aapane maan liya
 "please tell that during the UPA government, Congress leader Jagdish Tytler has also been a minister in the Manmohan Singh government
 lekin sajjan kumaar ko sajaa milane ke baad sikh dangon kaa jinn ek baar phir baahar nikal aayaa or 84 danga maamle main tamaam aropiyon ko sajaa milane kii aas ek baar phir jaagi
 In such a situation, Tytler's public participation in the Congress program once again brought back memories of the Sikh riots
 vahiin mana ja rahaa he ki puraane netaa ko kaman milane se party main kinare kar die gaye netaaon ke achche din ek baar phir laut sakate hai
 On the occasion of taking charge of the Delhi Congress, former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit said that the party itself realized that it is my hope and that too
 unhone kaha ki loksabhaa chunaav ke liye party ko dabl kaam karnaa padegaa
 Responding to the political comments coming on the command of the state Congress, Sheila Dixit said that let the opponents target, it will not have any effect
 bataa den ki shila dikshit ne pehali baar dilli congress kii kaman 1998 main tab sanbhali thi, jab halaat aise ban gaye the ki party ko kai chunaavon main lagaataar haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 The party had lost the 1991, 1996, 1998 Lok Sabha and 1993 Assembly and 1997 body elections
 aise main shila dikshit ne farsh par padi party ko arsh tab pahunchaaya or lagaataar teen baar dilli kii mukhyamantri raheen
 By the end of Lok Sabha elections 2019, the words lost their meaning

 Pictures of leaders peeping from SUV cars, Modi waving at huge rallies, Amit Shah trying to imitate something similar, Rahul Gandhi flaunting the sleeves of a kurta and the fiery postures of Mamata Banerjee

 The camera lens tries to filter and serve what is said in words, so the photographer sometimes sees a scenario that is contrary to the popular narrative

 India Today group photo editor Bandeep Singh said that this time i had a unique opportunity to take pictures of the two main heroes of this election
 teen dinon main maine pradhanmantri narendra modi or rahul gandhi kii kai tasviren lee
 The time i took to get close to these two leaders while taking pictures, i spent time with them during this time so that i could read them very closely, knowing that i could break inside the spg's Laxman Rekha, what i saw here is shocking And was about to deliver many messages
 25 april ko varanasi main piem modi ke shandaar road sho ke ek din baad mujhe unki tasviren lene kaa mauka mila
 At the Assi Ghat, he was giving exclusive interviews to the anchors of Aaj Tak
 is dauraan ek krooj par ganga nadi main saiyr karte hue unhone ajtak se bhi baat kii
 The Prime Minister had arrived at seven o'clock in the morning, he was wearing a flimsy white kurta and neatly kept the pressed Angavastram
 wo kaaphi fresh dikh rahe the, haalanki varanasi kii garmi or bheed bhari galiyon main road sho kiye hue unhen abhi aath ghante se kam hi hue the
 i felt that his hair was dyed yellow, what is henna? i immediately realized, these were light traces of marigold petals showered on him during a road show a day earlier
 espiji ke suraksha chakra ke baavjood logon kii pahunch untak thi, wo logon se milakar chir parichit andaaj main muskura rahe the
 The first part of the interview was on the go
 ganga kii laharon ke kinare ghat par 8 baje subah padane vaali dhoop kii kirane garmi ko asay bana detii hai
 But at least the Prime Minister's face did not seem to have any effect
 naa pasinaa, naa pyaas, naa hi ankhon par suraj kii kirnon se pareshaani kii nishaani, or na hi khud ko garmi se bachaane kii koi koshish
 They looked quite comfortable even in the summer, even going to the benches in the sunlight on the ghats, sometimes towards the benches
 is dauraan jab ek sthaneey chaay vaale ne unhen chaay di wo ve bina kisi pareshaani ke use pi gaye, or use shaabaashi bhi di
 During the entire interview, he did not mention the loud response and huge crowd found in the roadshow
 laga jaise iskaa unpar koi asar hi na padaa ho, ve bina ekaagratha khoe baatcheet main lage rahe
 Their attention was not disturbed even when they were descending the steep steps of the ghat, or walking on the banks of the bumpy river
 lekin kuch tha jo chhot rahaa tha
 During the entire three-hour interview, some lines of concern were coming from the Prime Minister's face
 pehle to maine sochaa ki ye suraj kii vajah se he, garmi yaa phir lambey prachaar abhiyaan kii thakaavat
 But his face expression on the airborne cruise boat remained the same
 wo baar-baar vipaksh ke netaaon dwaara apamaanit kiye jane kii charchaa kar rahe the or dukhi maaloom pad rahe the
 Certainly i did not find the person whom Narendra Modi had met so closely in India Today Conclave on 2 March
 ye balakot main ek aatanki camp par strike ke chaar din baad kaa maamla tha
 Then i felt like Modi, whose personality was showing strength, his body language was strong and the eyes of a big politician were shining in his eyes
 yahaan par varanasi main unka aabhamandal ksheen dikh rahaa tha
 Here he looked worried, or was he able to see something like this far away
 iske do din baad hi rahul gandhi ne dilli se agra ja rahe apane charter privet jet par hamen intervyuu kii ijaajat de di
 As Rahul is not used to such interviews and photoshoots, his front did not appear ready for such a close conversation
 mere camere ke lens ne jo dekha wo anoothaa or ek khulaase jaisaa tha
 There was no sign of 'pappu' in his personality
 raajnneeti ke liye missfit dikhne kii bajaay is baar rahul paripakv or dheer-gambhir dikh rahe the
 He came, sat in front of us in the aircraft and bowed as soon as he started speaking
 sawaal kuredne vaale or kai baar nijee the, lekin unki bhav-bhangimaaye sahaj raheen, unke aawaaj kii lay kabhi nahin badali
 The lack of space in the Twelve Seater Aircraft did not bother him at all
 isi jagah main 6 feet se zyada bada mere camere kaa frem intervyuu lene waalon ko peeche se shoot lene kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 My camera was pressing the flash directly in front of them and constantly
 haalanki is dauraan kabhi bhi vah self consos nahin dikhe, jabaki camera lagaataar unke moments, clic karata tha
 His focus was on interviews
 vah bekal, adheer nahin the, balki saamaanya dikhe, haalanki unki style forcephul or gahari thi
 During the interview, the distance between the questioner and them was not more than one and a half feet, during the conversation their hands moved with the rhythm of answering the questions
 jaise-jaise intervyuu nijee hota gaya, unke jawaab anubhavon main kam or vyakhyajanit zyada hote gaye
 At times he looked anxious, reacting and without depth, but his eyes were firm and straight
 unki aawaaj gusse se bhari, hamalavar thi
 But at times he looked defensive and unhappy
 unke shabd parfect nahin the, lekin unke jawaab main aashaa or josh dikhaa
 When the flight landed in Agra after half an hour, it was time for Rahul to leave
 sachin payalat or ashok gahalot ek helicopter ke saath unka intjaar kar rahe the
 This led him to visit a place called Saipu in Rajasthan
 rahul utre or sidhe choper main chale gaye, unhone apana phone seat par rakhaa or choper ne udaan bhari
 We waited there for more pictures of Rahul
 ek ghante baad ve waapas laute dher sari kachauriyaan lekar, ise unhone airport or grount stoff ko diya
 Within two minutes, the effect of the sun started to appear on them
 selfi ke liye jab wo muskura rahe the to unke chehre par thakaan tari thi, unke chehre par consus hone ke lakshan the
 He wanted to board his jet as soon as possible
 mere camere main unki aakhri tasviir itmeenaan se bhari muskuraahat kii thi

 parmaanu qaraar par america raashtrapati donald trump kii dhamkee par iran ne bhi palatwaar kiya he
 Iran has bluntly stated that it will not make any changes to its nuclear deal
 iran ke videsh mantralay ne ek bayaan main kaha ki iran is samjhaute main kisi badlaav ko sweekaar nahin karegaa, chaahe yah ab ho yaa baad main ho
 Trump had advocated the ban, while relieving the sanctions related to the nuclear deal that the European partners should decide the fatal terms of the agreement, otherwise the US would withdraw from it
 trump ne kaha tha ki nae samjhaute ke saath iran ke missile kaarykram ko rokna chahie or iran ke parmaanu sanyantron par sthaayee pratibandhon ko shaamil karnaa chahie
 Iran rejected Trump's demand
 Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javed Zarif said that no agreement could be reached in 2015
 irani videsh mantralay ke bayaan main 14 logon par nae pratibandhon kii aalochana kii gai
 The US imposed these restrictions on human rights issues and Iran's missile programs

 In his statement, he said that this is the last time
 (america or europea shaktiyon ke bich) koi aisa samjhauta na hone kii sthiti main america iran parmaanu samjhaute main bane rahane ke liye ek baar phir se pratibandhon ko maaf nahin karegaa
 The ban was lifted in 2015, before US President Donald Trump said he would soon decide whether to ban Iran again
 iran or duniya ke chah pramukh rashtron-america, britain, rus, france, china or germany ke bich aitihaasik parmaanu qaraar par hastakshar hone ke baad 2015 main tehran ke khilaaf lage pratibandhon ko hataa liya gaya tha
 In Barack Obama's agreement, several liaisons had announced in October last that it was one of the most poorly signed and tilted agreements ever reached by the US
 unhone iran par samjhaute ke ulalanghanon kaa aarope lagaaya tha or vaada kiya tha ki samjhauton kii kai khaamiyon ko dur karne ke liye vah congress ke saath milakar kaam karenge
 Senior Republican Senator Marco Rubio has said that the agreement reached during Barack Obama has many flaws and Iran should not be exempted from sanctions

 While addressing the rally in Gurdaspur, Punjab, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked the Congress fiercely
 unhone kaha ki congress sirf jhooth or dhokhadhadi kii raajnneeti kar rahi he
 Their history is playing with national security and even today they are spreading lies to weaken the army, even today they are opposing Vande Mataram and Bharat Mata Ki Jai
 hajaaron sikh bhaaiyon bahanon kii hatya kaa itihaas jinka rahaa ho or jinhone sikh dangon ke aropiyon ko mukhyamantri pad kaa puraskaar diya he
 Punjab will have to avoid them
 unhone kaha ki akali dal or bijepi kandhe se kandhaa milakar punjab ke vikaas ke liye kaam kar rahe hai

 Keeping in view the country's spirit, the NDA government has taken a historic decision to build the Kartarpur Corridor
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress jhuthe vaadon se kisaanon ko thag rahi he
 Due to debt waiver, in 2009, farmers trusted the Congress
 us bharose kii sajaa aaj bhi kisaan bhugat rahaa he
 In 2008-09, the farmers had a debt of 6 lakh crores
 congress ne sirf 60 hajaar karod kaa karj maaf kiya
 The situation of the Congress is the same in Punjab
 vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan congress ne vaada kiya tha ki 10 hajaar karod kaa karj maaf karenge, lekin dedh saal baad sachai kya he? congress maan rahi he ki usne abhi tak sirf 3400 karod rupye kaa karj maaf kiya he
 Just as Congress cheated the country with the slogan of poverty removal, now it is cheating in the name of debt waiver

 Dheerendra Singh, who was a Congress supporter at the time, got him riding on his bike
 haalanki, kisaanon or police ke bich hinsak jhadap ke baad dhirendra ko giraftaar bhi kar liya gaya tha
 Why left Congress: Dhirendra says that the party is not functioning properly
 iske kaaran usne party chodi
 He is also angry with Congress' campaign strategist Prashant Kishore's campaign
 6 saal pehle rahul gandhi bhatta parsaula main kisaanon ko saport main virodh ke liye pahunche the
 At that time there was Mayawati's government in UP
 dhirendra ne mail today se baatcheet main bataaya ki pichley 3-4 maheene se party main koi kaamkaaj nahin ho rahaa he
 All the secretaries in the party have been appointed to please the senior leaders
 kisaanon kii andekhi kaa aropadhirendra kaa kahana he ki congress ke saath kisaan pehle isliye khadey the kyonki party ne unke liye kaam kiya tha
 He further said, "we have been fighting for issues related to farmers
 jameen adhigrahan ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaai
 i should have talked to senior leaders about farmers' issues but i am not showing any interest in Delhi
 '' prashanth kishor kii niyukti par naaraazgi jataate hue dhirendra ne kaha ki pike kii team ke yang wolintier party ke senior members ko aadesh de rahe hai
 Sharing an experience, Dhirendra said that a 20-year member of Prashant Kishore's team called us and started asking how many supporter can we take in buses in Deoria
 ham log dilli se itane kareeb hai, aakhir devaria 900 kimi dur bas se kaise ja sakate hai
 Such behavior led to sadness
 bataa den ki kuch maheene pehle rahul gandhi ne upi main kisaan yatra kii thi
 The Congress is sad because of this: Dhirendra Singh, Dhirendra Singh, i am sad because of the failures of the Congress
 haalanki, unhone iske liye rahul gandhi ko jimmedaar nahin mana
 Said, "rahul Gandhi is working for the party, but people around him are always missing him
 maine shanivaar ko ol india congress cameti ko apana istipha saunp diya he

 saujany: NEWS flickssojanya: NEWS FLICKS After resigning as Chief Minister, Jeetan Ram Manjhi said on Saturday that he did not stab Nitish Kumar's back, but Nitish must remove him prematurely under the influence of "commissioned middlemen"
 shuukravaar ko rajbhavan main chauthi baar bihar ke mukhyamantri pad kii shapath lene vaale nitish ko badhai dete hue kisi samay unke vishwaasapaatr rahe maanjhi ne kaha ki vah bhi shapath grahan samaaroh main hissaa lenge
 Manjhi, while speaking to the media, while correcting his decision to resign from the post of CM, said, "I adopted a rebel attitude against Nitishji only when his (nitish's) intention was to give only slogans for the poor and downtrodden" Has unhone kaha, nitish ji kii tasviir abhi bhi mere kamare main lagi hui he
 That picture reminds us of waging a campaign for the problems of the underprivileged and the poor
 lekin mere man main unke liye ab adarbhav tabhi utpann hoga, jab ve garibon evam dabe-kuchlon ke liye bane agendon ko moort rup denge
 Manjhi took others during his tenure, including giving free electricity for irrigation to scheduled castes and tribes, farmers holding land up to five acres, reducing the 75 percent compulsory attendance for students to get the benefit of bicycle and dress scheme
 Referring to the decisions, he said, if Nitish ji fulfills the agenda set by me for the poor and the downtrodden, then i thank him Will aisa nahin hone par unhen benakaab karne ke liye janata ke bich jaaoongaa
 Video darasal raajnneetik jaankaron ke mutabik iske peeche kii sabase badi vajah yah he ki nitish kumaar kaa yah maananaa he ki congress bijepi ke khilaaf vipaksh kii dhuree banane main naakaam rahi he or lalu parivaar ke upar lage bhrashtachar ke maamalon ke kaaran rajd ke saath gathjod unki chhavi ke liye khatra he
 In fact, during the Assam elections last year, he first asked Nitish Kumar to form an alliance of opposition parties with the Congress, but the Congress ignored his demand
 natijatan 15 saalon se assam kii satta par kabiz congress harkar baahar ho gai
 He then advocated a grand alliance on the lines of Bihar in Uttar Pradesh, but that too had no effect
 uske baad upi ke chunaav parinaamon main bijepi kii prachand jeet ke baad nitish ko yah lagane laga ki bijepi ke vijay rath ko rokane kaa saahas ab congress ke paas philhal nahin he
 The comments raashtrapati chunaavon main bhi nitish kumaar ne vipakshi ekta kii vakaalat karte hue pahal kii lekin in sabake bich bijepi ne namnath kovind kii ummidavaari kaa pehle hi elaan kar diya
 As the Governor of Bihar, Nitish supported him and said that mere opposition gathering without 'alternative discussion' made no sense
 aise main badi baat yah he ki yadi nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan se alag ho jate hai or bijepi ke saath saajhedaari kar lete hai to ek taraf se vah vipaksh kii taraf se pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaari kii res se hat jaaenge
 Secondly, in case of corruption, if Nitish removes Tejashwi, his image of good governance Babu will benefit
 isse bijepi ko yah phayda hoga ki unke kheme main phir se ek kaddavar cheharaa hoga lekin saath main yah bhi chintaa hogi ki abaki baar nitish kumaar kaa kad pehle kii tulana main thodaa ooncha hoga

 In the presidential elections too, Nitish Kumar took the initiative advocating opposition unity but in the midst of all this, BJP has already announced the nomination of Namnath Kovind
 bihar ke rajyapal hone ke naate nitish ne unka samarthan karte hue kah diya ki bina 'vaikalpik vimarsh' ke keval vipakshi jamaavada kaa koi matlab nahin he
 In such a situation, the big thing is that if Nitish Kumar breaks away from the Grand Alliance and forms a partnership with the BJP, then on one side he will withdraw from the race for the post of Prime Ministerial candidate from the opposition
 doosraa bhrashtachar ke maamle main yadi nitish, tejasvi ko hataa dete hai to unki sushasan babu kii image ko laabh milegaa
 This will benefit the BJP that their camp will again have a strong face but at the same time it will also worry that Nitish Kumar's height will be slightly higher this time
 aise main badi baat yah he ki yadi nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan se alag ho jate hai or bijepi ke saath saajhedaari kar lete hai to ek taraf se vah vipaksh kii taraf se pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaari kii res se hat jaaenge

 That is, a film that has a female lead and the whole story is woven around it
 yah acha he ki sonam kapur apane gharelu production main us johnor kii filmein bana rahi hai jo abhi tak sirf hollywood main prachlit tha
 Her home production debut film Ayesha was also a chick flick and appealed to Urban India
 khubasurat bhi aisi hi film he jo india ko apil karti najar aati he
 Of course, while Rekha's beautiful used to tell the story of upper middle class, Sonam's beautiful becomes completely elite
 aaysha jine austin ke upanyaas emma par aadhaarit thi to khubasurat 1980 kii film khubasurat kaa rimek he
 The film is normal

 Earning talk is for film urban audience or say multiplex audience

 In the Legislative Assembly, seats will be reserved for Scheduled Castes as well as Scheduled Tribes

 Assembly seats may increase in Jammu and Kashmir According to the proposed delimitation, the assembly of Union Territory Jammu and Kashmir may increase by 7 seats
 7 siten badhane par centre shasit jammu-kashmir kii vidhansabha main 90 siten ho jaaengi

 jammu sambhag kii aabaadi 69 lakh he, or vahaan se 37 siten hai jabaki kashmir ghati kii aabaadi 53 lakh he, or vahaan se 43 siten hai

 In which a son is dragging his elderly helpless mother to the roof
 becoground main budhi mahila kii bahu bhi dikh rahi he
 The son takes his mother to the terrace and then falls silent for a while
 iske baad betaa lautataa he
 But his old mother does not return with him
 betaa aaraam se apane ghar ke andar chalaa jaataa he
 His mother still does not return
 iske baad jo hota he
 Knowing that, the ground will slide under your feet
 aapke munh se nikalegaa ki bhagwaan bachaae aise bete se
 But what the son has done to his mother
 uske liye use bhagwaan bhi maaf nahin karegaa
 The talk is on 27 September 2017

 And there is a daughter-in-law of an elderly woman standing on the shore, who is watching all this
 chappal pehanaane ke baad betaa apni laachaar maa ko lagbhag ghasitate hue seedhiyaan chadhaane lagata he
 The mother has slippers in her feet
 betaa nange pair he
 The son takes his mother to the terrace
 or uski bivi ghar ke andar chali jaati he
 At 8
57 minutes, the son descends from the terrace
 uske pairon main chappal hai jabaki apni maa ko le jate vakt wo nange pair tha
 After removing the sandal, the son goes inside the house
 uski bujurg maa nahin lautati
 After some time a person runs up the running stairs

 The son of an elderly woman opens the door
 donon ke bich kuch baat hoti he
 After this, the son comes down the stairs comfortably
 peeche peeche uski bivi bhi baahar aati he
 The police are then informed that the mother of a man named Sandeep has fallen from the terrace

 But the question was that an elderly woman who could not even wear slippers on her own
 jo seedhiyaan nahin chadh sakati
 Which his son took to the terrace with great vigor
 wo durghatanavash chat se gir jaae
 can it happen
 lekin is cese main aisa kuch tha

 At first Sandeep kept walking the police, but when the police tightened up, he broke down and the police were also surprised to know what he told
 wo apni laachaar maa ko chat par le jane ke itane jatan isliye kar rahaa tha
 So that by pushing off the roof, the old mother can take the burden off her shoulder and her wife gets rid of the duty of caring for her sick mother-in-law
 police ke mutabik sandip ghar kaa iklauta betaa tha uski do bahane hai
 One married and one was not getting married
 isliye ghar main tension thi
 The old mother had quarrels with her son and wife
 isliye usne maa ko chat se dhakka dekar maar daalaa
 In this way, the face of the murderer of his mother was exposed to the world
 jis maa ne apane bete ko acha insaan banane ke liye naa jane kitne dukh sahe honge
 That son had to take care of his ailing mother so exasperated that he did not feel any pity while throwing his mother from the roof

 Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, an MP from Bhopal, has been in constant controversy
 taaja vivaad unki beemaari ko lekar he
 In fact, she was to appear in the NIA court in Mumbai, but Sadhvi was admitted to the hospital after speaking of her illness
 lekin unki kalai tab khuli jab bhopal main maharana pratap kii jayanti par yojit kaarykram main sadhvi narebaaji karti najar ain
 Sadhvi also appeared on the occasion of Eid, and on the next day of Eid, when she was to go for muscle, she was suddenly hospitalized
 lekin maamla tab jaakar samaj main aayaa jab sadhvi kii tasviir maharana pratap ko shradhanjali dete hue saamne ai
 In fact, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, who became a MP from Bhopal after defeating Congress veteran Digvijay Singh, says she is ill for not appearing in court and also attends Maharana Pratap's birth anniversary on the same day
 bhopal main maharana kii murti ke paas bijepi ke log ikattha hue
 Sadhvi Pragya also reached there
 car se utrin or maharana pratap kii murti ke saamne maathaa bhi teka
 Not only this, Sadhvi also started shouting slogans along with the rest of the workers
 uske baad saamne media ke mike pahunche to sadhvi ne maharana pratap ke kshatriya hone kaa bakhaan kiya or unhen hindu asmita se joda
 At the same event, when media persons reminded Sadhvi that her health was bad, Sadhvi also suddenly said, 'it is hot, it happens
 ' haalanki maharana pratap jayanti ke kaarykram main wo thik dikh rahi thi
 On seeing him, it did not feel like there was any problem in his health
 lekin achaanak wo to itani biimaar ho gayi ki aspataal main bhartee ho janaa padaa to sawaal apane aap hi khadey ho jate hai
 Actually, Pragya Singh Thakur is accused of Malegaon bomb blasts and this case is still going on in Mumbai's NIA court
 april 2017 main sadhvi pragna ko 9 saal kaid main rahane ke baad sashart jamaanat di gai thi
 On June 3, the NIA court ordered Pragya Singh Thakur to appear every week
 iske tahat pragna ko 7 june tak court ke saamne pesh hona tha
 On Wednesday night, news came that Sadhvi Pragya Thakur had high back pain and high blood pressure and she was admitted to the hospital
 udhar, sadhvi pragna ke vakil jepi mishra ne enie adaalat main arji laga di ki sadhvi beemaari kii vajah se pesh nahin ho saktin
 In such a situation, questions arise whether Sadhvi was admitted to the hospital to avoid court appearance? Because while Sadhvi's lawyer was arguing for Sadhvi's illness in NIA court, Sadhvi was bowing before Maharana Pratap's idol
 sawaal ye bhi uth rahe hai ki agar sadhvi itani hi biimaar thim to wo maharana pratap kii jayanti ke kaarykram main kaise pahunch gayi? yahaan yah bhi bataanaa jaruri ho jaataa he ki is kaarykram ke baad sadhvi phir aspataal laut gayi
 The NIA court had said in its order that Sadhvi Pragya can escape the trial on grounds of just cause
 to kya sadhvi ne apni beemaari ko hi peshi se bachane ke liye thos vajah bana liya? Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani has supported Congress leader and party candidate Milind Deora from South Mumbai for the Lok Sabha elections 2019 (elections 2019)
 milind devda ne khud iskaa video twit kiya he
 This video has come at a time when Congress President Rahul Gandhi is constantly attacking Mukesh Ambani's brother Anil Ambani
 milind devda dwaara saajha kiye gaye video main mukesh ambani kehete sunai de rahe hai, ''milind dakshin mumbai se jude hai
 
 
 They have a good understanding of the socio-economic and cultural eco-system here
 duusari taraf, congress ke ummidavaar milind devda ne ek twit main kaha, 'chote dukandaar se lekar bade udyogpati tak, dakshin mumbai ke kaa matabal udyog he
 We should work towards providing jobs to the youth by bringing industries back to Mumbai and that should be the first priority ”
 From small shopkeepers to large industrialists - for everyone, South Mumbai means business
 We need to bring businesses back to Mumbai and make job creation for our youth a top priority

 The terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed is behind the Pulwama attack and Jaish had already warned about this attack
 ajtak ne masood ajahar ke chote bhai kii wo dhamkee aapako dikhaai thi jisamen pathankot jaise hamale kii baat kahi gai thi
 But the question is that there was also intelligence on the attack on the CRPF camp in Pulwama
 baavjood iske aatanki hamale kaise ho gaye
 How certain was the plot of terror attack on Pulwama? najarbandi kii nautanki khatm hone ke baad lahore main hafiz said ne kashmir par khun garm karne dene vaali chetavanee di thi
 The sooner Hafiz Saeed gets treatment, the better it will be for us, because now this devil is going to change the dress of the religious leader and wear the costume of the real leader
 darasal pulavama hamale kaa jimmaa jaish ne liya he
 The same Jaish is born Masood Azhar
 vahi masood ajahar jiskaa bhai pathankot jaise hamale kii dhamkee de chukaa he
 If we consider, Kipulwama will be attacked in Pathankot
 1
 The attack in Pulwama was carried out on the day before the New Year, while the attack in Pathankot was carried out the day after the New Year
 2
 Taking advantage of the harsh winter night is an important part of Jaish's plot
 isliye pulavama main raat 2 bajkar 10 minute par hamalaa kiya gaya
 While Pathankot was attacked at 3:30 pm
 3
 The target of Jaish are the security forces
 pulavama menciarpief campto pathankot main airbase ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya tha
 Three armed armed terrorists entered the CRPF camp, while 6 terrorists entered the Pathankot airbase
 4
 The style of the attack is the same, first the attack with grenade and then the firing
 iske baad rihaishi ilaakon main ghuskar zyada se zyada nuksaan pahunchaana
 Significantly, the terrorist boss of Jaish is awed by the elimination of his operatives in Kashmir
 khaskar aatanki nur traali ko dher kar jaish ko jo chot di gai usase wo bilabila rahaa he
 In front of the campaign of security forces, new intrigues are being hatched
 masood ajahar kaa manobal us china kii vajah se bhi ooncha ho rahaa he jise ek aatanki main sant dikhataa he

 gaanv, samaaj or shahari taane bane kii kissagoi kii parampara kahaniyon kii nai va varnashankar prajatiyon main gum na ho jaae
 Lamhi's latest issue of october-december 15 is a response to these things

 Thus, this issue of Lamahi includes some really new poets and poets like Khemkaran Soman and Sandhyat Navodita and Rama Yadav, but this time there are two unique memoirs in Lamahi's account

 Yogindra not only narrates the desolation of the place of memory of Nagar, but on this pretext, he also draws the memory of memorylessness to the extent of forgetting all the creators of Hindi

 Pankhuri Sinha in her article has assessed the fresh and carved novels

 a poet has said: To tell the truth, it is also necessary to live it properly

 But Deadline's heroine reveals the truth as soon as she steps on the first rung of her life, and then the bitter truth is pursued by her to the point of ruin

 After the Dadri incident, suddenly the Sahitya Academy Award has become a platform for writers to express their anger
 sahityakaron ko sahitya academy puraskaar ke rup main vartmaan samay main ek lakh rupee, ek shawl or smriti chihn diya jaataa he
 Letters written by only eight: So far, the academy has received a letter from the decision to officially return the award only by eight writers

 rajasthan ke alvar main sariska baagh abhyaranya ke gaanvon ke liye aatank kaa paryaay ban chuke killer tendue ko aakhirkaar pakad liya gaya he
 The Sariska administration claims that the leopard caught today is the real man-eating leopard
 iske daant toote hue hai or ye khunkhaar bhi he
 However, this can be confirmed only after DNA test
 shanivaar ko bhi ek tendua pakadaa gaya tha lekin baad main ye saaf ho gaya tha ki pakadaa gaya tendua wo aadamkhor nahin he jisane ilaake main kahar barapa rakhaa he
 After this, the administration was back in search of the man-eating leopard
 sariska ke kshetreey nideshak aar es shekhavat ne bataaya ki is pakade gaye tendue kii umr kareeb 10 varsh he jopantharon kii umr ke lihaaj se boodha ho chukaa he
 Also this panther has no teeth below it
 tendue kii ore se ab tak maare gaye 6 logon kii jaanch main yah baat bhi saamne ai ki jin-jin logon ko maaraa gaya tha un logon ke jakhmon main bhi nichle hisse main daanton ke nishaan nahin aae hai
 So now it is clear that this was the man-eating leopard
 vyask hone kii vajah se yah panther zyada bhagdaud nahin kar saktaa tha isliye usne aasaani se graminon ko apana nishaanaa banaaya 
 He told that when a carnivorous wild animal is old, it does not easily attack large animals and seeks its food only by attacking small animals
 sariska prashasan ne teen din duusare tendue ko pinjre main kaid karne main safalataa praapt kii he
 Forest officials claim that this is the leopard caught today, it is the man-eater who has killed six people
 yah killer tendua santawala khohara gaanv ke jangal main pijanre main kaid hua he
 Yesterday evening, the search team of Sariska found the location of this panther in Santwala Khorah, after which Ramji had planted this cage from Guada and this morning the leopard was imprisoned in the cage
 sariska ke diefo balaji kari ne bataaya ki is tendue ko jaipur chidyaghar main rakhaa gaya he
 Here, Sariska sources said that the leopard which has been caught today, has a panther chip attached to it
 is tendue ko 3 maheene pehle alvar ke sariska ilaake se hi jaipur chidyaghar main choda gaya tha or uske kuch din baad hi jaipur chidyaghar se us tendue ko waapas sariska ilaake main chhod diya tha
 When this leopard was released for Jaipur Zoo, many villagers were attacked by this leopard in which 2 people died
 is sambandh main jab kshetreey nideshak aar es shekhavat se panther ke chip lagi hui hone kii baat kii to unhone koi jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 It would be difficult for the government to answer why this killer leopard was finally released

 uttar pradesh ke sanbhal main hatya kaa dil dahalane vaala video viral hua he
 Here a young man has been killed publicly with a sharp weapon and an ax
 ek parivaar ne mritak yuvak ko bataaya ki apana laapata betaa bataaya he, jo teen maheene se gaayab tha
 The police have registered a case in this case and started investigation
 upi police aparaadh or aparaadhiyon par kaabo paane ke lakh daawey kar le, lekin ye hakeekat ke aage tik nahin paa rahe hai
 When his family was waiting for action from the police-administration for the young man missing for three months in Sambhal, a viral video of his son's murder reached them, which shocked everyone
 video main dekhie katl kii dil dahalane vaali vaardaat
 
 
 In this viral video, the young man is being brutally murdered
 ek shaks par teen-chaar log dhardhar hathiyaar se hamalaa kar rahe hai
 One killer is wielding an ax, the other a sword, the third is punching the iron with a rod
 jameen par gire shaks kii cheekh badhati ja rahi he
 The whole body is covered in blood
 uski haalat dekhakar bhi hatyaron ke haath nahin rukte hai
 The axes keep doing one after the other
 jab isse bhi man nahin bharaa to ek hatyare ne pathar uthaa liya
 Hit the head of the man who was suffering
 48 second kaa ye video dil dahala dene vaala he
 a person has been killed in just 48 seconds

 But it continued to be sent one after the other in the mobile
 isi kadi main azamgarh ke ek shaks ne sanbhal main rahane vaale ladke ke bhai ko video whatsap kiya
 There was chaos in the family after watching the video
 parivaar ko 3 maheene se gaayab ladke kii pahchaan karne main der nahin lagi
 It is also written in this video that there was no work of law under PM Modi's rule
 isko zyada se zyada share kar modi ke mantriyon tak pahunchaaen
 Now the question arises that who wanted to make it available to the ministers of the government
 aanan-fanan main parivaar police ke paas pahunchaa
 The police were also shocked after watching the video
 parivaar ne police ko bataaya ki ladkaa koi or nahin balki ajab singh he, jo dilli main naukari karata tha
 It suddenly disappeared from there
 police tafteesh main jute gai he
 The biggest challenge before the police is to find out which person is being murdered
 hatyare koun hai
 Who made the video viral? sapa supremeo mulaayam singh yadav ne akhilesh yadav or ramgopal yadav ko party se nikaal saaf sandesh de diya he ki party ke asli bos ve hi he
 Mulayam has expelled Akhilesh and Ramgopal for 6 years
 mulaayam singh yadav ne donon ko party se nikaal ye 5 'singh' jaise sandesh die hai -1
 With this decision of SP Supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav, it seems that now he is not at all worried about the assembly elections to be held in a few months
 ab ye unako puri tarah se samaj main aa gaya he ki unka apana betaa unki apekshaaon par khara nahin utar paaya
 2
 apane bhai or bete ko 6 saal ke liye party se nikaalane ke baad mulaayam singh ye saaf massej dena chaahate hai ki unke liye party se upar koi nahin he
 The party will not be allowed to break up due to any reason
 3
 One thing he made it clear that the people who have formed the party, who created it, will remain settled on it and it will go completely in it
 4
 By taking this decision in Indian politics, he has hurt the long-standing dynastic politics
 5
 Ekla Chalo Re's policy will not run in the Samajwadi Party

 din bhar kii thakaan ke baad agar sukun kii neend mil jaae to duusare din nai shuruyaat karnaa bahut hi fresh hota he
 But this night's restful sleep is not recorded in everyone's account
 is beemaari ko nite dred ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Experts believe that most working people get used to waking up frequently during the night
 agar aapaki aankh bhi raat main sote samay bematlab hi kai baar khulti he to aap catstrophising yaa nite dred naamak beemaari ke shikaar ho sakate hai
 In this disease, sleep opens in the middle of the night and the person is shocked
 stress he badi vajahaaajkal kii jindagi main ghar, rishton or offis ke kaam kaa pressure tanaav ko badhaane ke liye kaaphi he
 Stress has a deep relationship with your relaxed sleep
 jab aapkaa dimag shant hota he to aapako acchhee neend aati he or aap dinabhar taazgi se bhare rahete hai
 But as soon as your mind is filled with pressure and stress then it affects your sleeping habits
 yah samasya insomania kii beemaari se bahut alag he
 So do not associate it with this disease
 karavat lenaa he amkisi bhi chintaa kii vajah se raat ko neend kaa tut janaa, bechaini mahasoos hona, man udhaas hona, tanaav or paseene kaa aana aadi aam lakshan hai
 The reason is that a person sleeps for between 90-120 minutes and most of these people turn in the meantime and then fall asleep
 lekin iske vipareet kai logachintaa or dar kii vajah seuth jate hai or phir dobaaraa so nahin pate hai
 This problem can happen to anyone
 kya kaaran hai iskeis beemaari ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai jaise: der raat tak jaagnaa, khanpan kii aadaton kaa kharaab hona, depressant or menopause jald ho janaa
 The percentage of this disease is increasing everyday and school children are also suffering from it
 is beemaari main log akaaran dar ke shikaar ho jate hai or bina baat ke hi jaldi hyper hone lagate hai
 This disease mostly catches negative thinking people
 bacchon main bhi is tarah anggity dysorder dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 It happens to people who are unable to express their feelings
 kaise karen bachaatpane dimag menskaaratmak bhav laane ke prayaas karen
 Share your mind with someone close to you or start writing your feelings in a diary
 is samasya ko samay rahete thik karnaa bahut jaruri he
 At night, you make a habit of reading a good book
 saath hi ladaai-jhagade vaali movies or games se dur rahen
 Keep the routine, keep your daily routine
 sone se pehle kuch jaruri kaam karne kii aadat daalen jaise: gahari saans lenaa, apane takie par lavendar ke tel kii kuch boonden lagaae, chamomile chaay pien, soft mujeec sunen
 Listening to music relaxes the mind and keeps it away from negative emotions
 blad pressure ko narmal rakhane ke liye vyaayaam karen jisase neend aapako acchhee neend aegi
 Sleep routine becomes irritable in humans and due to this, the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease also increases

 B
 es yediurppa karnataka main mukhyamantri pad ke liye bijepi kaa cheharaa hai
 The BJP had announced it long ago, but now Yeddyurappa will not be seen on the stage in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election rallies in Karnataka
 party ne yediurppa ko alag se prachaar karne ke liye kaha he
 Yeddyurappa will be seen only on 1 May at Prime Minister Modi's rally in Chamarajanagar district
 isi raily se pradhanmantri karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke liye apane kareeb ek hafte ke prachaar kii shuruyaat karenge
 After all, what is the reason for keeping Yeddyurappa away from the Prime Minister's rallies? Let us know that Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday targeted the BJP by naming Yeddyurappa at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi
 bhrashtachar kii baat karte hue rahul ne kaha tha ki kaisaa lagegaa jab pradhanmantri modi karnataka main reliyon main manch se bol rahe honge or unke peeche hi yediurppa khadey honge
 To cover more area, Prime Minister Modi will be in Karnataka from May 1 to May 8 and in the meantime he will address three election rallies every day
 bijepi kii koshish yahi he ki pradhanmantri ke prachaar abhiyaan ke dauraan karnataka kaa zyada se zyada kshetra cover kar liya jaae
 The bjp's logic behind keeping Yeddyurappa away from the Prime Minister's rallies is that it will reach more people in all the assembly constituencies
 bijepi or congress donon ke liye karnataka vidhansabha chunaav saakh kaa sawaal bana hua he
 There is only one year left for the Lok Sabha elections
 aise main karnataka main nattejey jis party ke paksh main bhi aate hai, uske liye loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari main booster kaa kaam karenge
 Assembly elections are to be held in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh in november-december this year
 in teenon rajyon main bhi bijepi or congress sidhe mukaable main hai
 Coming in the last minute, modibjp is confident that like in the last few assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will come in slog-overs on the pitch of propaganda and by hitting strongly against the opponents, the atmosphere will be completely in favor of BJP
 bijepi or karnataka main sattarum congress, donon kii koshish he ki rajya trishanku vidhansabha kii naubat naa aae or ve apane boote hi bahumat hasil kar len yaa uske bahut najadik pahunch jaaen
 However, most opinion polls are expecting a hung assembly in Karnataka
 agar aisa hota he to devegoda- kumaraswami kii party jedies or anya kingmekar kii bhoomika main aa sakate hai
 Karnataka BJP spokesperson Vaman Acharya says with full confidence that the election results will be in bjp's favor
 acharya ne india today se kaha, 'bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or yediurppa ne ground work puraa kar rakhaa he
 The voters are in favor of the BJP
 pradhanmantri modi ke prachaar main utarane se maahaul puri tarah bijepi ke paksh main ho jayega
 'party upset with Yeddyurappa? Voting for Karnataka Assembly on May 12
 aise main prachaar ke aakhri 10 din membijapi or congressdonon hi apni puri takat jhonkne main koi kasar nahin chodengi
 Kusar-pusar continues in the political corridors about Yeddyurappa before the Prime Minister arrives to campaign in the Rann of Karnataka
 yediurppa ko pradhanmantri kii reliyon se alag rakhane ke peeche bijepi kii or se beshak adhik se adhik nirvachan kshetron ko cover karnaa vajah bataaya ja rahaa ho lekin raajnneetik jaankaron kii ore se aise bhi kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai ki yediurppa se kuch baton ko lekar party netritv kii naaraazgi ho sakati he
 Let me tell you that Yeddyurappa's son Vijayendra had sought a ticket to contest from Varuna assembly seat, but the party refused to do so
 tikat naa milane par vijayendra ke samarthakon ne virodh pradarshan bhi kiya tha
 Yeddyurappa has been seen with the Reddy Brothers, one of the reasons may be that Yeddyurappa has recently lived
 janardan reddy ke saath manch share kiya tha or ye bhi kaha tha ki reddy bros kii maujuudagi kshetra main 10-15 siton ko bijepi ke paksh main jhukaa sakati he
 Janardhana Reddy of Bellary is said to be the mining king
 arabon rupye ke khanan ghotaale main aaropee hone kii vajah se janardan reddy ko 43 maheene jail main bhi rahanaa padaa tha
 The Supreme Court had also barred Janardhana Reddy from entering Bellary
 janardan ke do bhai- somashekhar reddy, karunaakar reddy or behad kareebi shriramulu samet unke nazdikiyon ko bijepi ne is chunaav main aath tikat die hai
 Janardhan is associated with the party's campaigning by staying away from Bellary
 jaahir he bijepi ne bellari or aasapaas beshak reddy bros or unke karibiyon par is baar bada daanv khelaa he
 But the party is also taking caution that in Karnataka elections, the message should not be given that the tainters are being given more price
 yediurppa ke naam par sahmati mushkilyediurppa ko lekar sabhi atakalon ko khaarij karte hue vaman acharya kehete hai, yediurppa ne khud elaan kiya ki unka betaa chunaav nahin ladega
 The victory of the party matters to all in the BJP
 party sutron kii ore se ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki yediurppa ko siem ke liye party apana cheharaa ghoshit kar chuki he or is faisle ko badalane kaa koi iraadaa nahin he
 There is also a discussion in the political corridors that if a hung assembly comes up in Karnataka and BJP comes to join hands with the JDS, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to agree on Yeddyurappa as the leader of the alliance

 Meghna Gulzar's film Raazi has been well received by the audience and critics
 film main sahamat naam kii bahadur kashmiri ladki kii kahani riter harinder sikaa ke nowell 'colling sahamat' par besd he
 Agreed is married to the son of a Pakistani army officer, but the film is missing mention of Agree's first love
 baharhaal, ye shaks jinda hai or vah sahamat or apane rishte ke bare main kai baaten bhi share kar chuke hai
 So Farooq does not want Raji's real 'agreed' picture to be revealed in Harinder Sikka's novel, it is mentioned by the person Abhinav's name, apparently it is not his real name, but a fictitious name
 film main sahamat kii jindagi ke sirf ek hi pyaar yani deshprem par focus kiya gaya he
 However, there is no mention of Sehmat's second love i
e
 his lover, who is a tall athlete
 jaankaree ke mutabik, sahamat kii abhinav se mulaakaat dilli unirvasity main hui thi
 Where is Abhinav now? Agreed no longer in this world, but Abhinav is now a senior citizen and living in Delhi
 riter harinder sikaa ne sahamat kii asal pahchaan duniya ko bataane kii bataa kii thi, lekin abhinav unke is faisle ke khilaaf hai
 Not only Abhinav, but many of the close associates of Sehmat are calling this disclosure of identity in vain
 yahaan tak purv siem faruk abdulla ne bhi aisa na karne ke liye riter ko khat likhaa tha
 Well, the author considered the acceptance of the revelation of this matter as important
 sikaa ne abhinav ke bare main bataaya ki vah philhal dilli main acchhee tarah se bas gaye hai or mujhe lagata he ki main unki gopneeyata main ghuspaith kar rahaa hum
 "I am just trying to ask them if Agree is related to a person?" He is now a national asset (figure)
 vah nayak hai
 'children's names have started thinking' Raji 'star Aaliya Bhatt, Yeh Hai Reasons Why did Sahama go back to her first love when she returned to India? Sikka said that Abhinav's love for Sehmat was like a test
 sahamat kabhi uske paas waapas nahin lauti, balki abhinav khud uske paas gaye
 In fact, when she returned to India, Abhinav took care of Sehmat in every way
 sahamat jab bharat lauti to vah depressant main dubi huin thim or ek bachche ke saath garbhvatee thim
 He had no reason to return to his earlier life
 'riter sikaa kaa sahamat kii pahchaan ko ujagar karne kaa yahi makasad he ki vah us sahamat jaisi bahadur ladki kii pahchaan ko dikhaakar ye trend shuru karnaa chaahate hai ki log bhi unhen jaan saken jo bina vardi ke desh ke liye itnaa bada jokhim lete hai
 Sikka poses the question here as to why our brave agents die unsung and unknown
 'yahaan jaankaree ke liye baat den ki harinder sikaa ko sahamat kii bahaduree kii kahani likhane main kareeb 7 saal kaa samay laga tha
 Sikka, a Naval officer himself, reached out to Sahayam with the help of Sahmat's son and gathered information
 sahamat ne khud is baat kaa zikr kiya tha ki pakistan main rahakar bharat ke liye jasusi ke mishan main vah kaamyaab raheen, lekin is mishan main kai hatyaein huin jinamein se ek unke pati bhi the

 buudhvaar ko first class cricket kii apni aakhri pari khilne utre tendulkar ne naabad 79 ran banaakar mumbai ko ranjai trophy main haryana ke khilaaf shandaar 4 wicket se jeet dilaai
 In this match started on Sunday, Haryana scored 134 runs batting first
 jawaab main mumbai kii team pehali pari main 136 ran banaae
 However, Tendulkar could not bat in the first innings and he returned to the pavilion after scoring just 5 runs
 haryana ne duusari pari main behatar pradarshan karte hue 241 ran banaae
 During this, Sunny Singh scored the highest innings of 63 runs
 mumbai kii ore se jahir khan ne chaar wicket jatke
 Mumbai needed 240 runs to win and Tendulkar to bid him a first-class farewell
 wasim jafar or kaustubh pavaar pari kaa aagaaj karne utre lekin acchhee shuruyaat dilaane main naakaam rahe
 Mumbai lost five wickets for 165 runs, but Tendulkar remained at one end
 is dauraan tendulkar ne kuch aakshark shot khele
 Slogans of 'sachin, Sachin' kept echoing on the field throughout the match and the legendary batsman did not disappoint his fans by hitting his 115th first class half-century
 mushkil wicket par ballebaaji karke tendulkar ko aayaa majamatch ke baad tendulkar ne kaha, 'ye chalanging wicket tha or gendbaajon kii madadgaar pich thi
 It was fun to bat on this wicket
 outfield bhi kaaphi dhimi thi
 Even though the target was 240 but it was not less than 280 on this wicket
 mujhe aisi hi ek outing kii jarurat thi
 Just talking about cricket and getting to know each other
 
 
 bahut majaa aayaa

 ' satara main piem modi ne kaha- shetakari samaaj ko pehle sirf vaade milavipaksh kii raajnneeti kaa ek hi aadhaar, baanto, baanto, baanto or malai khaopradhanmantri narendra modi ne guuruuvaar ko vipaksh par tikhaa prahaar karte hue maharashtra ke satara main vipaksh par saavarkar ko badnaam karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 In his election speech, he attacked the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party fiercely
 piem modi ne kaha, 'aaj tak bhaajapa ke paas sirf shivaji maharaj ke sanskaar the
 Now we have Shivaji's rites as well as his family
 sanskaar or parivaar kaa ye sangam vir shivaji ke sapanom kaa maharashtra, unke sapanom kaa akhand hindustan banane main ahm siddh hone vaala he
 'he said,' For the past 5 years, the government of Mahayuti (alliance) has acted as per the rites of Shivaji Maharaj both at the Center as well as in Maharashtra
 rashtraraksha or rashtrawaad ko hamane praathamikta di he
 Those who keep an eye on India land will be given a befitting reply
 ''sarkaar ne sena ko taqatvar kii shrenee main laa khadaa kiya'piem modi ne kaha, 'shivaji maharaj ne rashtraraksha ke liye ek shashakt sena ko praathamikta di
 In that period too, he built a strong navy
 beete 5 varshon main hamaari sarkaar ne bharat kii sena ko duniya kii taqatvar senaaon kii shrenee main khadaa kar diya he
 He said that for the defense of the nation, for the integration of the nation, the government of Mahayuti has taken such decisions which were not shown before
 lekin durbhaagya kii baat he ki aaj yahaan maharashtra main jo hamaare virodh main khadey hai, unhone rashtraraksha ke liye uthaae gaye har kadam kaa virodh kiya
 'it hurts with the question on the valor of the soldiers', he said, referring to the Upshey Military Village, that the village is dedicated to national defense
 vahaan ke ghar-ghar se rashtrarakshak nikle hai
 Where can such rites belong, how can politics tolerate harm to the nation
 yahi kaaran he ki congress or NCP ke netaa jab hamaare vir javaanon ke shaury par sawaal uthaate hai, to satara ko thes pahunchati he
 When they propagate a modern ship like Rafael, the land of the national devotees feels immense pain
 'baanto, baanto, baanto or malai khao'piem modi ne kaha, 'jab ye artical-370 ko lekar afvaahen failaate hai, tab puraa satara niraash hota he
 When Veer Savarkar tries to discredit the national heroes, Satara's mercury rises to the seventh sky
 'unhone kaha, 'jahaan kaaryakartaaon main, gathbandhan main hi bantwaaraa he, wo maharashtra ke samaaj ko ekajute bhala kaise kar sakate hai? inaki raajnneeti kaa ek hi aadhaar he, baanto, baanto, baanto or malai khao
 PM Modi said that these rites are not at all of Chhatrapati Shivaji
 unhone to sambhaav or sadbhaav se rashtraseva kaa maarg hamako dikhaaya he
 This path has been strengthened by the government of Mahayuti in the last 5 years
 shetakari samaaj ko pehle sirf vaade mili, ab kammaharashtra ke mehnatee shetakari samaaj ke naam par baaten or vaade bahut kiye gaye, unke naam par netagiri bhi bahuton ne chamakaayi
 But the government of Mahayuti has done the job of thinking about Shetkari society in the true sense
 sinchai se lekar kamai tak ke tamaam prayaas ham kar rahe hai
 All farmer families of Maharashtra are benefiting from PM Kisan Samman Nidhi
 laghu kisaan pariwaron, khet mazdooron ko, chote dukandaaron ko, 60 varsh kii aayu ke baad pension kii suvidha bhi tay ho chuki he
 'government worked for sugarcane farmers in 5 years' Every effort has been made in the last 5 years to solve the problems of sugarcane farmers
 ganne ke laabhakaari mulya ko laagat kaa dedh guna se adhik tay kiya gaya he
 Whenever there is a problem, we have tried to ensure that farmers get their dues on time
 ganna kisaanon ko sirf chini ke bharose naa rahanaa pade, iske liye ithenul ke utpaadan par bal diya ja rahaa he
 Modern factories are being built for this across the country
 hamaara prayaas he ki aane vaale samay main petrol-dijal main kareeb 10 pratishat tak ke ithenul kaa upyog kiya ja sake
 The general poor also got reservation, the Maratha society should have reservation, the poor families of the general class got reservation for the first time in history, only the government of Mahayuti has shown this
 mahayuti kii sarkaar kaa hameshaa se ye prayaas rahaa he ki kisi kaa shoshan naa ho, kisi kaa haq naa maaraa jaae
 Women empowerment has also gained unprecedented strength in the last 5 years

 aaj shani jayanti he jo ai he shani ke hi priy din shanivaar ko auki unke priy ank 8 taarikh ko
 The importance of Shani Jayanti has increased manifold this time with many rare yogas
 subah se bhakton kii baari bheed mandiron main juteni shuru ho gayi thi
 By offering oil in the Shani temple of Delhi, someone is earning a fortune just by seeing Shani Dev
 ahmednagar main shani ke sabase bade dham shani shinganapur or indore ke shani mandir main bhi bhakton kaa tantaa laga he
 Devotees across the country appeared eager to earn merit on this day
 shanidev kii krur drushti agar aapke jivan main uthal-puthal machaa rahi he to ye khushkhabari aapke liye he
 If you are troubled by Saturn's crooked gait, then this is also good news for you
 shanidev se agar aap kuch maangane ke liye soch rahe hai to aaj kaa din aapke liye bhi he
 This time on Shani Jayanti, you can get the full blessing of Shani Dev
 unki vakri drushti se aapke jivan main sukh samruddhi kii barsaat ho sakati he
 Because after many years, Shani Dev Jayanti is lying on Saturday, and due to Saturn being in its high zodiac sign, it is becoming icing on the cake
 kyonki tula raashi main hone ke kaaran shani kii krurta main kami aegi
 According to Shani Jayantihindu religion, the festival of Shani Jayanti is celebrated on the new moon day of Jyeshtha month
