 haryana kii hisar seat par loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke chathe charan main ravivaar ko vot daale gaye
 72 according to the official figures of the Election Commission in Hisar
 19 fisadi voting darj kii gai
 a total of 70 in the Lok Sabha elections 2019 in Haryana
 21 fisadi matdaan darj kiya gaya
 There are 26 candidates in the fray for this seat
 bijepi ne bijender singh ke bete brijendra singh ko tikat diya he jabaki congress ne unke mukaable main bhavy bishnoi ko maidan main utaara he
 Indian National Lok Dal has given ticket to Suresh Kothi
 vahiin dushyant chautaala jananaayak janata party ke tikat par apni kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 The Aam Aadmi Party and Jananayak Janata Party are contesting in an alliance
 2019 main hisar loksabhaa seat par romaanchak muqabla dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 This is one such Lok Sabha seat in Haryana on which the Bharatiya Janata Party has never won
 is baar haryana main chunaav se purv koi bada gathbandhan nahin hone se parinaam chaunkaane vaale ho sakate hai
 Apart from politics, the city of Hisar has its own distinct identity
 yah shahar bharat kaa sabase bada jasti loha kaa utpaadak he, jisase ise ispaat kaa shahar bhi kaha jaataa he
 The Bharatiya Janata Party lost its grip on Hisar seat in 2014 despite the Modi wave across the state
 is seat par indian neshnal lokdal (INLD) ke dushyant chautaala ne haryana janhit congress (HJC BL) ke kuldeep bishnoi ko haraaya tha
 In 2014 elections there was an alliance between BJP and (HJC BL)
 gathbandhan ke anusaar 10 main se 8 siton par bijepi ne or kuldeep bishnoi kii party ne 2 siton par chunaav ladi thi
 In 2014, Chautala received a total of 4,94,478 votes, while Bishnoi had 4,62,631 votes
 is tarah yuva dushyant chautaala ne hisar loksabhaa kshetra se 31,847 vot se jeet hasil kii thi
 In 2014, the INLD had to contend with the Hisar and Sirsa Lok Sabha seats in Haryana
 philhal kya he samikarnamaujuuda vakt main INLD main dophaad ho chukaa he
 The INLD is now occupied by Abhay Chautala, then Dushyant Chautala along with his father Ajay Singh Chautala and brother Digvijay Chautala has formed a new party called Jananayak Janata Party (JJP)
 darasal, om prakaash chautaala ke parivaar main kalah ke baad dushyant chautaala ko lokdal se nikaal diya gaya tha, jiske baad unhone 9 disambar 2018 ko jananaayak janata party banaai
 For the first time, this party contested the by-election of Jind assembly
 vaise to chautaala parivaar ko bade paimaane par jat samudaay kaa vot miltaa he
 But there is a possibility of loss to both of them in 2019 due to split in the family
 aise main bijepi or congress kii raah aasaan ho sakati he
 Before the 2014 elections, Hisar was considered a stronghold of former Chief Minister Bhajan Lal and his son Kuldeep Bishnoi
 hisar loksabhaa ke daayre main 9 vidhansabha kshetra aate hai
 As per the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, a total of 11,94,689 voters exercised their franchise in Hisar
 jisamen 6,53,423 purush or 5,41,266 mahila voters kii sankhya thi
 In 2014, a total of 1202 polling booths were built inside the Hisar Lok Sabha
 hisar kii seat aaj tak bijepi jeet nahin pai he
 From 1951 till now, the Congress has been successful on 7, in a way, this seat has been occupied by Bhajan Lal and Devi Lal's family for the last nearly three decades
 pichley teen dashak main keval 2004 main congress ke jai prakaash ko yahaan se jeet mili thi
 The young Dushyant Chautala was active throughout the term in Parliament
 unhone sansad main 191 dibet ke dauraan hissaa liya
 While he had brought the private member bill 17 times
 chautaala kii sansad main sakriyata is baat se dekhi ja sakati he ki unhone apane 5 saal ke kaarykaal main kul 582 sawaal puch daale
 At the same time, Dushyant has used about 80 percent of his MP fund
 ek tarah se dushyant chautaala ke raajnneetik safar kii shuruyaat ko shandaar kah sakate hai
 But in 2014, they had many challenges
 26 saal kii umr main anubhavheen dushyant chautaala ke liye hisar se chunaav ladanaa ek kathin pariksha thi
 Because the candidate of the coalition riding on the Modi wave was Kuldeep Bishnoi
 aise main kuldeep ko chunaav haraana aasaan nahin tha
 But Dushyant won
 dushyant chautaala kaa janm 3 april 1988 ko hua tha
 Hisar was founded in 1354 by the ruler of the Tughlaq dynasty, Feroz Shah Tughlaq
 us samay tughlaq ne iskaa naam hisar-e-firoza rakhaa tha
 After that, Firoza was removed from the name of this city under Akbar's rule and then remained only Hisar
 itihaas ke aaine se dekhen to hisar par kai samrajyon kaa shashan tha
 3rd century AD
 pus
 The city was occupied by the Maurya Dynasty, the Tughlaq dynasty in the 13th century, the Mughal Empire in the 16th century and then the British Empire in the 19th century

 The comments yahaan dekhen promo- See promo here rakshabandhan ke maukey par uttar pradesh main bahanon ko mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii taraf se shandaar tohfa mila he
 The number of recipients of this gift is not any small fat but about 90 thousand
 upi kii bahanon ko ye gift mila haikanya vidya dhanke rup main jiske tahat 2016 main intermediat kii pariksha paas karne vaali medhaavi ladakiyon ko 30 hajaar rupee ke check die ja rahe hai
 Keeping the Rakshabandhan in mind, the state government is distributing these checks by running a special campaign on 16th and 17th
 vidhansabha chunaav sar par hai or kanya vidyadhan paane vaali tamaam ladkiyaan aisi hai jo is baar chunaav main pehali baar vot daalengi
 Therefore, Akhilesh Yadav government is putting full force behind this plan
 buudhvaar ko lakhanu main kanyavidya dhan kaa check baantne ke baad mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki unhen bahanon se voton kii darkaar he
 Akhilesh Yadav said that the government has been upset over bringing good numbers to the meritorious girls
 lekin dubaara sarkaar main aane ke liye unhen bhi achche number kii jarurat he
 Hindustan, fighting against terror, has achieved great success
 ek lambii bahes ke baad sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad ne jaish-e-mohammad ke sargana moulana masood ajahar ko global aatanki ghoshit kar diya he
 So far China has been vetoing this issue but now due to international pressure, China has agreed to withdraw its veto
 kootnithik taur par bharat ke liye ye jeet aitihaasik isliye bhi he kyonki aisa pehali baar ho rahaa he jab kisi aatanki ko jammu-kashmir main kisi hamale ke liye jimmedaar maanakar use antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kiya gaya he
 In fact, till now the enemies of India who have been made global terrorists include Hafiz Saeed, the head of lashkar-e-taiba
 hafiz said par jammu-kashmir nahin balki mumbai main hamalaa karne kaa aarope he
 But the case of Maulana Masood Azhar is different from this
 kashmir se judaa rahaa he masood kaa kaala chitthapakistan nivasee masood ajahar kaa puraa itihaas jammu-kashmir se hi shuru hota he, phir chaahe vah qandahar cond ho yaa phir ab pulavama main hua bada aatanki hamalaa
 Actually, Masood Azhar has been active in Jammu and Kashmir since the 90s
 1994 main use srinagar se giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 But after the Kandahar scandal, the Indian government had to release him
 usee ke baad se vah bharat ke liye chintaa kaa vishay ban gaya
 After his release from India, Masood Azhar formed an organization called jaish-e-mohammed, which has so far carried out several terrorist incidents in India
 bharat main kin hamalon ke peeche jaish-e-mohammad kaa haath
 
 
 The attack on Parliament in 2001, the Pathankot attack in 2016, the Pulwama terror attacks in 2019 are the terrorist attacks that got the attention of the whole world
 lekin iske alaava bhi kashmir main rojaanaa jo chote aatanki hamale hote hai yaa sena ke saath muthbhed hoti hai
 jaish-e-mohammed terrorists are also involved in that
 kashmir kaa factor kyon ahm?darasal, jammu-kashmir main hinsa kii vajah se global aatanki ghoshit kiya janaa ek badi ghatana he
 That is because the whole world has been seeing this area as disputed till now and every time it has been giving the message that this dispute should be resolved by negotiating the two countries first
 itnaa hi nahin pakistan bhale hi duusare deshon ko madad maangata rahaa ho, lekin bharat kisi bhi tisare desh kii entry kaa virodh karata rahaa he
 However, India has said every time that Pakistan's land has been used to spread terror in Jammu and Kashmir
 pakistan bhi lagaataar is baat kaa virodh kar rahaa tha ki agar pulavama ke sajeeshkartaaon ke naam se jaish-e-mohammad kaa naam hatataa he to vah bhi global aatanki ghoshit karwaane ke liye saport karegaa
 Would you believe that this six month old baby goes to the salon for a haircut? You must be thinking that how much hair will be on the head of a six-month-old child, which he would need to go to the salon
 par aapako bataa den ki is bachche ke sir par ek vayask ke jitne bal hai

 Usually, children do not need a hair cut for two to three years after birth

 Hayley Hillman, the child's mother, who is a nurse, says that i have too much hair on my head and my father also had too much hair
 aap jab ise duusare bacchon kii tulana main dekhte hai to aapako ye ehsaas hota he ki iske sir par kitne bal hai
 She says that those who meet Fergus are not sure that she has so much hair on her head and they laugh at her
 Fergus kii do maheene badi ek chacheri bahan bhi he jise sir par na ke baraabar bal hai
 At the same time, his own sister Ella also had very good hair from birth

 Justice Khetrapal said that the Air India management sympathetically listened to the complaints of the pilots
 isamen hadtaal ke dauraan bakhrast kiye gayi payalton kii pun: bahaali kii maang bhi shaamil he
 The striking pilots appealed to the court to direct the management to withdraw 101 sacked pilots
 inamen indian payalat gild ke das padaadhikari bhi shaamil the
 The court has directed the pilots and management to appear before Chief Labor Commissioner NK Prasad at 5:30 pm on July 5
 samaadhaan se jude adhikari se nau july tak report maangane vaale nyaayamurti khetrapal andolnarat payalton kii union ke aavedan par sunwaayee kar rahe the
 The union had alleged that the Air India management sacked the striking pilots and destroyed their recognition and created an 'unfavorable atmosphere'
 kal adaalat ne payalton or prabandhan se vivaad kaa adaalat ke baahar sauhardpurn dhang se samaadhaan karne ko kaha tha
 Management counsel Lalit Bhasin told the court today that it should not consider the pilots' request as they are surrounded by contempt of court case
 unhone kaha ki yadi payalat ek baar hadtaal khatm kar dete hai to prabandhan payalton se baatcheet karne ko taiyaar he
 Bhasin said, "they (pilots) have been completely surrounded by contempt of court orders for the last two months and they need to end the strike before talking to the management on their demands
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘payalton ke vakil is adaalat ke samaksh bayaan den ki ve aaj hadtaal khatm karne ko taiyaar hai
 They should not have any preconditions to end the strike
 pehle unhen adaalat ke aadesh kaa paalan karnaa chahie or phir prabandhan se baat kerani chahie
 The lawyer appearing on behalf of the pilots said that the management has placed the pilots in two categories
 ve payalat jinhen bakhrast kar diya gaya he or ve payalat jo seva main hai lekin hadtaal kaa hissaa hai
 He asked the court to direct the management that all 434 agitated pilots, including the sacked pilots, be treated equally and the sacked pilots should be reinstated
 nyaayamurti khetrapal ne prabandhan se kaha ki vah mudde ke samaadhaan ke liye payalton se anaupchaarik vaarta kare
 He said, 'my concern is that the issue should be resolved at the earliest
 kisi ko bhi pareshaani nahin ho, na payalton ko or na airilines ko
 Pilots are not 'goons' or criminal elements
 aap unase baat karne ke baad unki shikaayat par vichaar karen
 Bhasin informed the court that the airlines were incurring a loss of five crore rupees a day and the strike was causing great inconvenience to the people
 sunwaayee ke dauraan is daleel par adaalat ne kaha ki payalat hadtaal ko waapas len
 The Pilots Association had said in its application that they were ready to return to their work but the management had created such an 'adverse' atmosphere which caused the pilots to go on hunger strike
 payalton ne yah bhi kaha ki bhukh hadtaal ke kaaran kai payalton kaa swasthya bighad gaya he lekin prabandhan ko isaki chintaa nahin he

 When Mahendra Singh Dhoni entered the Oval's press conference hall immediately after losing the Test series to England, it was a question he had to ask - "will you resign?" You have to wait and see if i am still powerful
 ” phir thode rahasyamay andaaj main unhone kaha, “ipiel ko doshi mat teharie
 "the fact is that India's defeat at the Oval was the third biggest defeat in cricket history
 bharat test main mahaj 90
 Could bat for 3 overs
 usase pehle old traverd match main 89
 It was a little better than the entire team getting out in 4 overs
 lodrs kii jeet ke baad bharat ne ek ke baad ek pariyon main dashakon baad lagaataar itane kam ran banaae
 So it was natural to raise the question floating in the air, to which Dhoni also replied - Is India now officially an ODI and Twenty20 team? In other words, can Test cricket be saved in India? Kapil Dev makes it clear, "if BCCI still does not take it seriously, then it is up to you to end Test cricket
 ”3-1 se siries kii haar ke saath hi dhoni kii captaini ne ek chakra puraa kar liya he
 She has returned to reach the same place where India had beaten 4–0 badly in the 2011 tour of England
 maano yahi kaaphi na ho, is dauraan dhoni kii captaini main videshi dharti par 16 test main se bharat ne iklauta test jeeta—isi siries kaa lodrs test
 Out of these, the Indian team lost in 12 Tests
 itani jabardast haar ke baad do sawaal to uthte hi hai
 Did the captain not run as expected of the team? Or did the team not perform as expected by the captain? Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara, 13, considered successors of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid respectively
 40 or 22
 He looked absolutely helpless with an average of 20 runs
 paanch teston main bharat lagbhag har pari main dharashayi hote hue dikhaa
 When the team fought in the first innings, it fell 22 wickets in 98 runs and when the second innings collapsed, it lost 27 wickets for 172 runs
 lodrs main bharat ko jitaane vaale eshanth sharma ne teen test maichon main 16 no ball daaleen
 Wasim Akram blames only the leadership for the devastation: “they knew what kind of challenge to face in England
 phir bhi ve sochate rahe ki sab apane aap thik ho jayega
 Dhoni's attitude seems to be a bit of a ruckus
 halaat jab bigadgaye shuru hue to unhone uskaa thik se jayja lene or use thik karne ke liye kadam uthaane se munh pher liya
 England scored around 20 per cent of the runs in the back of the square
 phir bhi bharat ne therdman par fielder nahin lagaaya
 His craze to keep Fielder on the leg slip could not get India a single wicket but still did not send Fielder to another place
 pehle unhone ravichandran asina kii bajaay rabindra jadeja ko khilaane par jor diya or phir unase leg-said vaali negative line par ball phenkane ko kaha
 This led to neither getting wickets nor scoring runs
 jab baaki sab dharashayi ho rahe the us maukey par dhoni ne balle ke saath bahaduree kaa parichay diya lekin unki wicket keeping dekhnaa takalifdeh tha
 He could not convert the slightly difficult prospects into opportunities, nor did he appear to be leaping towards the stumps to collect the throw
 saurav ganguli kehete hai, “gend yaa balle se naakaam rahanaa samaj main aata he lekin mujhe dhakka us vakt laga jab bharat ne puri siries main hi chizon ko badalane kii bilkul koshish hi nahin kii
 For example, he could change the batting order
 pujaara agar tisare number par or viraat chauthe number par ran nahin bana paa rahe the to unka kram kyon nahin badla gaya? form main chal rahe ajinkya rahane ko tisare number par laakar pujaara ko chauthe or viraat ko paanchave sthaan par khilaayaa ja saktaa tha
 What do they discus in team meetings? it's embarrassing
 ” mohammad ajaharuddin sidhi karrwai kii vakaalat karte haih “test ke captain ko badalane kii jarurat he
 While Kapil wants Dhoni to change his style
 unke shabdon main, “main hameshaa kahata aayaa hum ki hamen captain kool kii nahin, tej-tarraar or aakraamak captain kii jarurat he
 "till date, it is not known whether Test cricket is in Dhoni's priority or not
 dressing room kii charchaa yah he ki test cricket ke paanch lambey lagaataar dinon se ve ub jate hai
 In the summer of 2008, when he had to rest his back and fingers, he avoided Test matches in Sri Lanka tour of India and played only one-day matches
 2009 main newjiland daure par bharat ne hamiltan test chaar din main jeet liya
 Instead of going to Napier for the next Test in the anonymous and quiet city of Napier, Dhoni's team rushed to Auckland for a few days with glee
 acchhee team banane ke liye test cricketron ko dirghakaalik ranneeti par kaam karnaa padataa he
 The successors of the team that won the title of 'new India' - Tendulkar, Dravid, Ganguly, Laxman, Anil Kumble - have started getting tired at an early age after retiring
 virendra sahvaag, harbhajan singh, yuvaraj singh or gambhir umr ke tisare dashak kii shuruyaat main hi chuk gaye jabaki new india ke sadsy 35 kii umr ke paar bhi khelte rahe the
 a former selector says, "it makes sense with one or two players, but with four?" Looks like the dressing room wanted to thwart them so that they could be removed

" bhartiya cricket team ke agle coach ke taur par saurav ganguli or rahul dravid ko daavedaar bataaya ja rahaa he
 Out of these two, the choice of who is the next coach of Team India is very difficult
 yah maananaa he bharat ke purv cricketer sunil gavaskar kaa
 Former India cricketer Sunil Gavaskar, who joined ndtv's Sports Show as an expert with Dean Jones, said, "it is very difficult to choose one of these two
" mere khyaal se to jis tarah se donon captain or upakptain rahe the, use tarah hi unhen coach or vaais-coach yaa phir assitant coach bananaa chahie
 If i had to choose, i would have chosen both
 donon ke anubhav ko main khona nahin chahta
 Gavaskar's opinion suggests that it will indeed be difficult for Indian Cricket Board officials to elect one of Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly
 gavaskar kehete hai, bhartiya team ke coach ke taur par donon hi donon behtareen vikalp hai
 Both are leaders, both have excellent understanding of the game
 donon ne ucchstareey cricket main shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Both have played in all formats
 in donon main kisi kaa bhi coach bananaa bhartiya cricket ke liye shandaar hoga
 However, Sourav Ganguly has dismissed speculation about becoming India's coach

 Devilliers yesterday # indvsl # CT17 bharat or china main jari tanatani ke bich ajtak kii team ladakh border, sikkim border or tibet se sate uttarakhand ke mana border par halaat kaa jayja lene pahunchi
 This time India is also preparing to deal with China
 seemaa par sirf surakshakarmi hi nahin, balki seemaant gaanvon ke log bhi china se satark hai
 However, now the people of these areas do not have the fear of China if the situation here worsens
 inkaa kahana he ki yahaan par hamaare bhartiya faujee hamaari rakhwali ke liye hai
 So there is nothing to fear
 china se sate simavarti ilaakon ke log bhale hi bijli, pani, phone or rojgaar samet tamaam dikkaton se jujh rahe hon, lekin inke hausale saatven aasmaan par hai
 They say that there is a presence of military personnel on the border, due to which there is no need to fear China
 kharaab mausam main yahaan ke logon kii samasyaayein or bhi bad jaati hai
 At the same time, the hangover of the 1962 war over Chinese soldiers has not landed yet, but the preparations of our army show that if China turns its eyes now, bad days will begin for it
 yahaan rahane vaale logon ko aaj china se dar nahin lagata, kyonki inhen apane javaanon par pakkaa yakeen he
 Aaj Tak's team toured the area very close to Doklam
 doklam kaa tanaav bharat-china seemaa par har jagah dikh rahaa he
 Therefore, the preparations of the army are not only on the Sikkim border, but also on the snowy areas of Ladakh
 iske alaava uttarakhand ke simavarti ilaakon main itibipi ke farward post main dragon ko makul jawaab dene kii taiyaari jari he
 Even after 36 days, the figure of thirty-six is the thirty-sixth day of China's Dadagiri in Doklam
 dragompani harkaton se baj aata nahin dikh rahaa
 He is threatening daily
 chhattis din baad bhi donon deshon ke bich chhattis kaa aankada barkaraar he
 Aajtak's team reached Mana, the last border village of Uttarakhand's Chamoli district
 yah tibet se jude sarhad kaa aakhri chor he
 There are 3 passes from Chamoli to Tibet, which were the trade routes between India and Tibet before the 1962 war
 ab yahaan itibipi kaa farward post he
 Preparations are underway to give a suitable answer here after the latest Dadagiri of China
 yahaan par tainaat javaanon ko kadaa prashikshan diya jaataa he, jo chand minuton main 70 foot oonchi sidhi khadi chattan par chadhakar dushman nestnabut kar sakate hai
 Earlier on 2 June, 2 Chinese helicopters entered Baradoti of Chamoli, which was strongly opposed by India
 centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ke mantriparishad main bade paimaane par pherbadal kii taiyaariyon se pehle congress ne pradhanmantri modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki vah 'satta ke purna kendrikaran' main vishwaas rakhte hai, jisase sarkaar kii cabinet pranali puri tarah barbaad ho chuki he
 Senior Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said the reshuffle would not make any difference to the government as there was a shortage of talent in the Council of Ministers
 anand sharma ne kaha ki unhen unamem zyada pratibha nahin dikhti
 Although the reshuffle in the Council of Ministers is the prerogative of the Prime Minister, but it does not matter
 tippaniyan He told journalists here that he can appoint someone and remove someone and change someone's ministry, but that does not matter, because it is a prime minister who believes in complete centralization of power
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki desh main sarkaar kii cabinet pranali he, lekin pataa nahin ki ab vah us tarah se kaam kar bhi rahi he ki nahin
 He said key ministries were held for more than three years without a cabinet minister, which had never happened before
 input bhashaa se Anand Sharma said that he does not see much talent in them
 yun to mantriparishad main pherbadal pradhanmantri kaa visheshadhikaar he, lekin isse koi fark nahin padane vaala
 The comments unhone yahaan patrakaron se kaha ki vah kisi ko niyukt kar sakate hai or kisi ko hataa sakate hai or kisi kaa mantralay badal sakate hai, lekin isse koi fark nahin padane vaala, kyonki yah aise pradhanmantri hai jo satta ke purna kendrikaran main vishwaas rakhte hai
 The former Union Minister said that there is a cabinet system of government in the country, but it is not known whether she is also working in that way or not
 unhone kaha ki ahm mantralayon ko teen saal se adhik samay tak cabinet mantri ke bagaiyr rakhaa gaya, jo pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 From input language unhone yahaan patrakaron se kaha ki vah kisi ko niyukt kar sakate hai or kisi ko hataa sakate hai or kisi kaa mantralay badal sakate hai, lekin isse koi fark nahin padane vaala, kyonki yah aise pradhanmantri hai jo satta ke purna kendrikaran main vishwaas rakhte hai
 The former Union Minister said that there is a cabinet system of government in the country, but it is not known whether she is also working in that way or not
 unhone kaha ki ahm mantralayon ko teen saal se adhik samay tak cabinet mantri ke bagaiyr rakhaa gaya, jo pehle kabhi nahin hua tha
 From input language input bhashaa se The reform measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi are quite significant
 madhyam or deergh avadhi ke vruddhi ke aankadon main iske phaayde dekhne ko milenge
 The head of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, said this on Thursday
 kim ne antarrashtriya mudra kosh or vishwa bank kii salanaa baithak kii shuruyaat ke maukey par samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue kaha, ‘‘sudhaar prakriya praasangik he
 "he said," We believe that in the medium and long term economic growth, the seriousness of the efforts of the Prime Minister Modi government for reforms will definitely be seen
 ’’ kim bhartiya arthvyavastha kii haalia narmi se sambandhit sawaal kaa jawaab de rahe the
 However, both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have lowered India's economic growth projections
 pichley hafte, vishwa bank ke pramukh ne kaha tha ki bharat ke aarthik vikaas main hui haalia mandi alp avadhi kii he
 Responding to a question on India's growth rate, Kim said, "our team believes that there was a slowdown due to the passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST)
 unhone kaha, "pradhan mantri modi ne hamaare vyapaar rirpot ke liye ek bahut alag drushtikon liya
 His vision was that we move quickly
 or ham wo kaam karen jo kaarobaari maahaul main sudhaar karne ke liye ho
 '' gandhivadi kaaryakarta anna hajaare kii pramukh sahyogi kiran bedi ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke lokapal vidheyak ko lekar diye bayaan par tikhi pratikriya vyakt karte hue un par logon kii samvednaaon ke prati asamvedansheel hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 He said that he is imposing a 'cheat bill' on the country and is calling the hunger strike and the fast to protest against it as wrong
 desh kii pehali mahila ipies adhikari rahi kiran bedi ne micro bloging website twitor par likhaa ki pradhanmantri dhokhaa vidheyak ko desh par thope rahe hai or bhukh hadtaal or anshan ko galat bataa rahe hai
 He wants us to obey him
 kiran bedi ne kaha ki yadi pradhanmantri logon ke vichaaron ke prati samvedansheel the to vah ‘jokapaal’ ko thopane kii bajaay ise waapas lene kii ghoshnaa kar sakate the
 He said that the Prime Minister is not going on the reasons for the hunger strike
 yah :anshan: dhokhaa vidheyak ko thope jane ke khilaaf he jisamen kargar chizon ko shaamil nahin kiya gaya he
 Kiran Bedi said that surrender means accepting the government ombudsman which has nothing for the common man
 iske bajaay yah ek kanoonee bhram failaata he
 Earlier, Singh, in a speech on Independence Day, promised a strong Lokpal to curb corruption and admitted that some people of the central and state governments have allegations of corruption
 unhone anna hajaare ke anshan kaa sidhaa ullekh kiye bina kaha ki logon ko apni hi baat manwaane ke liye bhukh hadtaal or anshan kaa sahaara nahin lenaa chahie
 In the black money case, the central government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court, revealing the three names
 somvaar subah se is babat goa kii khanan kaarobaari radha satish timblu, dabar group ke chairman pradeep burman or rajkot ke kaarobaari pankaj chamanlal kaa naam charchaa main rahaa
 But in the evening, the news of Election Commission Watch giving it a new twist
 maamle main nayaa khulaasa yah he ki timblu privet limited ne beete 9 varshon main sirf bijepi ko 1
 18 crores has been given election funding
 rajnatik dalon ke liye corporate compinyon se chande kii chahat koi nai baat nahin he
 But the news of Election Commission Watch has definitely added a new thrill to the black money case
 iske mutabik vittiya varsh 2004-05 or 2011-12 ke bich radha timblu ne bijepi ko 1
 18 crores, while in 7 years Congress has donated Rs 65 lakhs
 yahi nahin, report ke mutabik, vittiya varsh 2011-12 main rajkot ke chamanbhai lodhiya ne bhi bijepi ko 51 hajaar rupee kaa chanda diya he
 Significantly, there are 13 electoral trusts in the country, out of which only 7 are approved by CBDT
 iske peeche kaaran yah he ki in trust kaa nirmaan 2013 main sibiditi rules aane ke baad hua
 The remaining six trusts are not approved by the CBDT, so according to the rules, they do not share any information in this regard in order to make donations
 sibiditi niyamon ke mutabik sabhi 7 trust ko apane chande kii jaankaree nirvachan ayog ko deni hoti he
 It is also interesting to note that the remaining 6 trusts have also donated Rs 105 crore between the financial years 2004-05 and 2011-12, which the Election Commission does not know much about
 iskaa arth yah hua ki jaankaree ke abhaav main yah kahana mushkil he ki baaki 6 trust ke jariye compinyon ne dalon ko jo chanda diya vah vaaki tex se chhot kaa aadhaar tha yakaledhanako safed karne kaa ek tarika
 Apparently in this era of disclosures and black money, there is a need that the remaining 6 electoral trusts should give detailed information about the amount of the donation so that the situation on black money can be clarified in the true sense
 in 6 trust main general elactoral trust, elactoral trust, corporate elactoral trust, bharti elactoral trust or satya elactoral trust ke naam shaamil hai

 The Samajwadi Party is currently the best example of how an electoral victory over opponents can infuse new 'blood' into an organization
 loksabhaa chunaav main parrast hone ke baad sapa kaa aatmbal tut chukaa tha, lekin vidhansabha upachunaavon main mili jeet ne party kaa ravaiya badal diya he
 Isharamulayam and Akhilesh have also been stripped of red light from very close leaders of big change
 mulaayam singh ke shuruaati daur ke saathi rajakishor mishra, sukhram yadav, madhukar jetali or jaishankar pandeya ke alaava akhilesh yadav ke najdiki raajapaal kashyap, sunil yadav, naved siddiki, aashu malik jaise netaaon ko darja mantri pad se hataakar sapa ne saaf sanket diya ki ab kaam hi party main aage badaae kaa paimaana hoga
 But criticizing it, BSP national general secretary Nasimuddin Siddiqui says, "the Akhilesh government does not yet know what to do
" kabhi laptop baantate hai to kabhi band kar dete hai
 Sometimes the minister takes back the position and immediately returns it
 agle vidhansabha chunaav main is sarkaar kii sari pole khul jaaegi
 "after the extremely backward Lok Sabha elections, Mulayam Singh had realized that the party could not be prepared for the next big electoral battle without bringing backward castes back to the BJP
 shaayad yahi vajah thi ki chunaav ke fouran baad rajyasabha kii ek seat ke liye hue upachunaav se sapa ne ati pichhadi jatiyon kii lamabandi karne kaa kaam shuru kar diya
 Among the most backward are the number of Kashyap, Bind, Nishad castes
 is sankhyabal ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sapa ne nishad jati se aane vaale purv saansad vishambar prasad nishad ko rajyasabha bheja
 On the other hand, Mulayam had also made his intentions by handing over the responsibility of increasing the party's penetration by continuously holding meetings with the most backward castes to the young leader Rajpal Kashyap
 muslim-pichhadaa gathjodloksabhaa chunaav main pradesh ke gaiyr yadav pichde or ati pichde virgon kaa ek bada hissabhartiya janata party (bijepi)ke paksh main lamaband ho gaya tha
 To break this and strengthen the penetration of the SP among the backward classes, Mulayamay has once again engaged in social engineering

 Changing the name during student union elections at the university is often misused

 Previously, students desirous of changing the name had to give an original copy of the advertisement published in at least two leading dailies, self-declaration of the applicant in the prescribed format and a copy of the Gazette Notification of India about the name change

 He is accused of campaigning in favor of the ruling political party SP during his official visit
 nirvachan ayog ko mahoba, muradabad or banda ke jila nirvachan adhikariyon se aisi report mili he
 According to the notice, the Commission was earlier assured that the voters will not be influenced in favor of any party during the official visit of the Advocate General
 chunaav sambandhi kaary ke liye sarkari mashinari kaa upyog bhi nahin hoga
 According to the report received from the election officials of the three districts, he has done election work in the government tour
 ayog ne mahadhivaktaa ke sarkari daure ko chunavi daure kaa samishran qaraar dete hue unase safai maangi he
 On the other hand VC Mishra has retaliated by saying that the Election Commission is working at the behest of BJP
 chunki unhone amit shah kii yachika kaa virodh kiya tha jisaki vajah se unako yachika waapas leni padi isliye badale kii karrwai kii ja rahi he

 Welcome to the 19th issue of the Job Series
 mujhe lagata tha ki berojgaar ek samuhik shabd he
 The use of this word raises the ears of all the unemployed
 lekin naukari series ke dauraan saikadon massej se guzarate hue laga ki yuva apni naukari, apni pariksha ko lekar alag-alag samooh main bante hai
 One group has nothing to do with unemployment or trouble of another group
 railway kaa berojgaar, bipiessi kii pariksha ke berojgaar se alag he or donon kaa ek duusare se koi matlab nahin he
 You will see this pattern within every two groups
 yahi kaaran he ki sankhya main adhik hone ke baad bhi yuvaaon kii koi raajnneetik haisiyat nahin he, na hi unki parikshaon ko chaar chaar saal taal kar kisi dal yaa sarkaar ko fark padataa he
 Youth is a group using a word like self-employment while fighting in small groups
 yahi kaaran he ki hamaara yuva apni ladaai to lard rahaa he magar uskaa dayera itnaa simit he ki netaaon ko koi fark nahin padataa he
 Right now the youth of India will have to live for four to five years and with a poor examination system
 na yuva apni barbaadi ke kaarnon ko pahachaanate hai na unke samajhadaar maa baap
 The political quality or understanding of our youth is very poor
 madhya pradesh main 18 farvari ko rajya seva evam van seva kii praarambhik pariksha hui
 Four days later, the students were surprised when the Commission responded to the questions asked on its website
 ve samaj nahin paae ki sawaal hi galat poocha gaya he yaa jawaab galat diya gaya he
 There were about 15 such questions which were disputed
 madhya pradesh ke akhbaar in vivaadit prashnon se bhare hai
 Just like who gave the slogan of Quit India, Jawaharlal Nehru has written in response to this question, which is wrong
 yousuf meher ali ne yah naaraa diya tha
 Not only this, now a student has to tell that if the answer is wrong, for this, he will have to pay a fee of Rs 100 for a question
 is baar 15 sawaal ko lekar vivaad he to 1500 rupee kii fees bharenge tab jaakar aap ayog ko chunauti de sakenge ki aapane jo uttar pesh kiya he wo galat he
 You will not see such a unique system in the world
 galati ayog kii he to use khud hi sudhaar karne chahie magar ho yah rahaa he ki ayog apni galati bataane vaale chaatro se 1500 rupee maang rahaa he
 It is just like if a chief minister says tomorrow that if you want to tell me my mistake, then you have to pay a fee of 1500 rupees
 kya aap is vyavastha ko tarksangat maanenge
 The Commission can say that a large number of students start challenging, when questions should be wrong, if the answers are wrong then lakhs of students should be challenged, but will they be charged a fee instead
 kya yah sahi nahin rahata ki ayog khud sudhaar karata or apni taraf se jawaab chhapata ki yahi jawaab he, hamaara jawaab galat nahin he
 After this examination, students are worried that if they prove the mistake of the commission by paying fees or agitate, they will study it when they do it
 chaatro ne gyaapan taiyaar kar liya he
 They are giving everything from Chief Minister to Governor
 sachiv vagairah ko bhi gyaapan de rahe hai
 The New World has written that in the year of 2010, 40 questions had to be changed
 aath saal baad itnaa sudhaar hua he ki 15 sawaalon par sawaal uth gaye hai
 If you want, you can understand this as development
 zaahir he chaatro kii neend ud gai he
 Should we not want an honest and better examination system, why is it that the youth are troubled in every state, but there is no question in any state
 kya yuvaaon ne yah tay kar liya he ki unka bhavishya sirf or sirf hindu muslim dibet jaise topic se he
 If the youth continue to cry for their exams then there will never be a better examination system in their state
 to apane liye nahin duusare ke liye bhi bolie
 If the railway apprentice students perform, then the Forest Service also attend it and the students of BPSC perform it, then go to the banking examinations, or listen to that song of Kranti daily, not that young man, who has no story
 kuch samaj nahin aa rahaa he to philhal tivi kam dekhie
 Slogan does not have heaven
 madhya pradesh main narmada baandh se prabhavit garib kisaanon ne jab pradarshan kaa yah tarika nikaala to rajya ke yuvaaon main se kam hi ne unka saath diya hoga lekin ab jab khud par beeti he to un kisaanon ke pradarshan kaa idia churaakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These days the workers working on contract in the health department in Madhya Pradesh are on indefinite strike
 ve permanent kiye jane kii maang kar rahe hai
 It is said that the more work they do, the more they receive double the money
 siwani zile main jab in naujavaanon ko apana tambu tak lagane nahin diya gaya to ye wan ganga nadi main utar gaye
 They remain in the water from eleven to half past four in the morning
 jab tak sab alag alag samooh main ladenge nadi ke baad naale main bhi utar jaaenge to bhi system ko fark nahin padegaa
 This basic thing has to be understood
 chaahe aap prime time dekhen yaa na dekhen
 These people have been working for 12 to 18 years, yet have not been cleared
 yojana band karne or kaarysamiksha ke naam par 2000 nikaal bhi die hae hai
 These people are nurses in Suture District Hospital, Civil Hospital, Community Health Service Center, are pharmacists, are data entry operators
 uttarakhand se hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne bataaya he ki rajya bhar main berojgaaron ke alag alag prakaar ke kai andolan ho rahe hai
 Just as i gained knowledge about the term unemployed, in the same way Dinesh Mansera has gained a knowledge
 vah yah ki rajya main sarkaar ne kai bhartiyon ko vigyaan or kala main baant kar berojgaaron ko hi aapas main bhida diya he
 For example, ITI and non-iti students are at loggerheads over the recruitment of Railways
 26 farvari ko uttarakhand mukhyamantri awaas ke saamne pradarshan kar rahi kareeb 30 mahilaon ko pakad kar bas main le jaaya gaya
 They all have diplomas in nursing
 15 march 2016 yani aaj se do saal pehle uttarakhand main mahila swasthya kaaryakarta ke liye 440 padon kaa vigyaapan niklaa
 More than 6600 ANM diploma-holding women applied by depositing fees of 300 and 600
 nai sarkaar ai to category badal gai
 It was said that only those nursing diplomas who have studied science in 12th class will get 440 positions
 ab is ek faisle se 5500 mahilaayein baahar ho gayi jinhone 12veen arts padhaa tha
 Whereas these women have spent three to four lakh rupees in three years to study from government and private nursing colleges recognized by the government of Uttarakhand
 tabhi sarkaar ko yah niti banani chahie thi ki arts se paas hone vaali mahilaayein nursing kii degree nahin le sakati hai
 In the Government Nursing College also, women graduating from both Arts and Science can do nursing
 phir naukari dene main yah bantwaaraa kyon
 There seems to be a strategy to make the restoration process disputed so that the case will continue in the case and time is cut
 naukari mili nahin, ab ye ladkiyaan pradarshan kar rahi hai, paise jutakar cese lard rahi hai
 Not only this, science and arts have also been distributed in the fills of Forest Guard, Horticulture Department, Forest Corporation
 berojgaar vaise hi bante hue hai, in sharton se or bant jaaen isse behatar sthiti kya ho sakati he
 Students have been performing at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences for five days
 mumbai campus hi nahin, tisus ke baaki teen campus main bhi pradarshan chal rahaa he
 There was a meeting with the administration but no solution has been found
 aap kabhi tis ke chaatro se miliega, inaki quality kaaphi acchhee he, padhai main yogya to hai hi, samaaj seva main bhi in chaatro ne kamaal kiya he
 But these demonstrations are happening because the Government of India has withdrawn the scholarships for SC, ST and OBC students
 tis ne aadesh jari kiya he ki 2016-18, 2017-19 batch ke chaatr tution fees, hostel fees or dining fees kaa bhugtan karen
 These students were getting post matric scholarship facility which is now closed
 media report ke anusaar tis prashasan kaa kahana he ki chaatravrutti nahin roki gai he
 Speaking to Priyanka Sahu of Indian Express, Tis administration has said that the institute is trying to raise resources at its level
 yah ajeeb tark he
 It should be met when the government was giving scholarships
 ab ek aisi samasya kaa zikr hoga jiskaa samaadhaan mujhe pataa nahin
 Students from MP to UPSC have told UPSC many times but these are not resolved
 jab bhi upiessi kaa farm nikalataa he ye chaatr ek chance die jane kii ummid main baichaiyn ho uthte hai
 Students from Tamil Nadu and Kerala also contacted, then felt that they would keep the talk
 aap jaanate hai ki 2011 main upiessi kii praarambhik pariksha main sisat lagu kiya gaya tha
 a lot of questions arose and caused ruckus
 chaatro kaa kahana tha ki nai pranali is tarah se he ki science, ejineering or angrezi madhyam ke chaatro ko phayda ho
 Arts students will be left behind and Hindi medium students may suffer
 sisat kaa andolan ne ek baar jor pakadaa tha tab bade bade netaa inke samarthan main aae the
 The students performed in front of UPSC on 29 January 2018
 2015 main sarkaar ne sisat ko qualifing round se hataa diya
 The government also decided that the students who had appeared for the UPSC for the first time in 2011, would be given the chance to take the exam one more time
 lekin 2012-13, 2013-14 main jin chaatro ko sisat ke kaaran nuksaan hua wo chaahate hai ki unhen bhi ek chance mili
 They believe that their chance is also ruined due to a system like CSAT
 is saal jab jammu-kashmir ke chaatro ko upiessi civil sarvice pariksha main baithne ke liye umr seemaa main paanch saal kii chhot di gai to phir se ye chaatr ashanvit ho gaye or baichaiyn bhi
 They say that when CM Mahmuba Mufti's efforts can give them exemption, then why are we not getting them
 shaayad ye chaatr hindu-muslim dibet ke naam par tivi ne kashmir ko jis tarah se pesh kiya or ye uske graahak bane ab thage hue se mahasoos kar rahe hai
 We do not know what the UPSC will decide, but if these students feel that they will be done with a lift in prime time, then it is right
 in chaatro ko ek sawaal khud se bhi poochna chahie jab duusari parikshaon ke chaatr pradarshan karte hai to kya ve unamem jate hai, unke dukhon se unhen takalif hoti he, agar sawaal kaa jawaab naa main he to prime time main bhi uthaane se kuch nahin hoga
 i pray that they get a chance
 guzarish karuunga ki hindu muslim dibet band karaane main sakriy bhoomika adaa karen varna wo javaani javaani nahin jisaki koi kahani nahin vaala gaanaa sunanaa padegaa
 You are watching the 19th issue of the Job Series
 central bank aaf india ne abhi tak 700 se adhik chaatro ko jwining letters nahin diya he jabaki pariksha paas kiye hue saal biit gaye hai
 You tell me, more than 700 students have passed the exam, many have left the job after getting in the merit list, now they are not getting joining letter for 11 months
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki politicil phixing vaale match se kahin zyaada ye badi khabar he
 Change your taste and preference for news, otherwise you are going to be cheated a lot
 elahabaad main uttar pradesh lok seva ayog kaa daftar he, iske saamne chaatro ne pichley shuukravaar ko pradarshan kiya
 These students are engineers
 sahaayak ejeeniyar or junior ejeeniyar kii bhartee ke liye 2013 main likhit pariksha hui thi
 JE had 3222 posts and Assistant Engineer had 952 posts
 vigyaapan niklaa 2013 main, likhit pariksha hui teen saal baad 11-12 april 2016 ko
 The written examination of JE took place on 22-23 May 2016
 iske baad se do saal biit gaya magar riselt nahin aayaa he
 On 11 December 2017, these youths demonstrated in front of the Commission and received written assurance that on February 15, the results of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer will be out in April
 15 farvari ko bhasma hue 11 din ho gaye hai
 It may be in India only that the result of the 2013 examination has not come till February 2018
 tabhi main kahata hum bharat ke naujavaanon ko kaaphi badha chadha kar pesh kiya jaataa he jabaki inaki polytical quality bahut karaab he
 If it was not bad, such a fraud would not happen to them in every state
 meri baat buree lag sakati he magar ve khud se check kar len meri hi baat sahi lagegi
 Students with physical challenges came to meet our colleague Manish Kumar in Patna
 inhone jo haal bataaya wo sunakar aap behaal ho jaaenge
 In 2010, these people passed the exam and were selected for various posts
 inaki sankhya 49 he
 He joined but after eight months, the Bihar Staff Selection Commission removed him from the job
 thik usee tarah jaise jharkhand main daaroga kii do saal kii training dekar, jwining kara kar unhen naukari se hataa diya gaya
 The reason given was that the disability reservation has not been properly followed
 is pariksha kaa vigyaapan 2010 main niklaa tha, teen saal baad 24 agast 2013 ko riselt aayaa tha
 He was employed from January 2014 to August 2014 but was later removed
 inhen prime time kii naukari series se ummid ho gai he ki shaayad sarkaar sun le
 You must be wondering if there is a court in this country
 bilkul adaalat he or patna hoicourt ne 20 agast 2015 ko order bhi diya tha ki in 49 viklangon ko phir se behaal kiya jaae
 Restoration has not yet taken place
 ye dobaaraa hoicourt gaye or disambar 2016 main phir se hai court ne kaha ki inaki bahaali ho
 But it did not happen
 aapako lagata he ki hoicourt ke do do adeshon se jab kisi ko fark nahin padaa to prime time se fark padegaa
 The comments hamane naukari series kii shuruyaat staff salection kamishan kii pariksha se kii thi
 In the last episode, we mentioned that 353 youths were waiting for the letter to join the postal department of Maharashtra Circle
 hamane prime time kii naukari siries ke 17wein ank main maharashtra cirkil par jor diya tha
 Today the news of posting on the website of Maharashtra Circle has arrived
 353 naujavaanon ko bataa diya gaya he ki kiski posting kis branch or shahar main hogi
 It is also a pleasure for us
 agar ek sho se 353 chaatro ke jivan par asar pad saktaa he to naukari series may kii jagah july tak karuunga
 Can not the youth of our India achieve an honest examination system, if we intend, we will also achieve it
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha sijiel 2016 ke chaatro ke liye bhi ek khushkhabari he
 We had also raised the question of this examination that the joining letter is not being given to the youth who have passed
 iskar vibhaag kii sanstha sibiditi ke liye 1114 padon ke liye pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 It was also mentioned in the first episode
 aath maheene baad ab chitthee milegi
 Those who have been appointed to the post of Income Tax Inspector are instructed to elect their place of choice and submit the form
 chaliye ye bhi puch rahe honge ki holi kab he, kab he holi
 
 
 Newspapers in Madhya Pradesh are full of these controversial questions
 jaise bharat chodo kaa naaraa kisne diya tha, is sawaal ke jawaab main jawahar laal nehru likhaa he jo ki galat he
 Yusuf Meher Ali gave this slogan
 yahi nahin, ab kisi chaatr ko yah bataanaa he ki jawaab galat he to iske liye use ek sawaal ke liye 100 rupee kii fees bharani hogi
 This time there is a dispute about 15 questions, then you will pay a fee of 1500 rupees, then you will be able to challenge the commission that the answer you have presented is wrong
 duniya main aisi nayab vyavastha aapako kahin nahin dikhegi
 If the mistake is of the commission then it should rectify itself but it has been happening that the commission is asking for 1500 rupees from the students who have declared their mistake
 thik vaise he jaise kal koi mukhyamantri kahe ki aapako meri galati bataani he to aapako 1500 rupee fees deni hogi
 Would you consider this arrangement rational? ayog kah saktaa he ki badi sankhya main chaatr chunauti dene lagate hai, dene hi chahie jab sawaal galat honge, jawaab galat honge to lakhon chaatro ko chunauti deni chahie lekin iske badale kya unase fees lee jaaegi
 Is it not right that the Commission would reform itself and print its answer that this is the answer, our answer is not wrong
 is pariksha ke baad chaatr pareshaan hai ki fees dekar ayog kii galati sabit karen yaa andolan karen, yah sab karenge to padhenge kab
 The students have prepared the memorandum
 ve mukhyamantri se lekar rajyapal sabhi ko de rahe hai
 The Secretary is also giving memorandum to et cetera
 nai duniya ne likhaa he ki 2010 ke saal main to 40 sawaal badalane pade the
 After eight years, there has been so much improvement that 15 questions have arisen
 aap chahen to isi ko vikaas samaj sakate hai
 It is evident that the students have lost sleep
 kya hamen ek eemaandaar or behatar pariksha vyavastha nahin chahie, yah kyon hai ki har rajya main yuva pareshaan hai magar kisi rajya main yah sawaal nahin he
 Have the youth decided that their future is just and only from a topic like Hindu Muslim Debate
 agar yuva apni-apni pariksha ko lekar rote rahenge to unke rajya main kabhi ek behatar pariksha vyavastha nahin banegi
 So do not speak for yourself but also for others
 railway aprintis ke chaatr pradarshan karen to van seva vaale bhi usamen jaaen or bipiessi ke chaatr pradarshan karen to usamen banking pariksha vaale bhi jaaen, varna kranti kaa wo gaanaa rose suna kiijie, wo javaani javaani nahin, jisaki koi kahani nahin
 If you do not understand anything, then watch TV less now
 slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 When the poor farmers affected by the Narmada Dam in Madhya Pradesh came out with this method of demonstration, very few of the youth of the state would have supported them, but now when they have passed on themselves, they are stealing the idea of the performance of those farmers
 madhya pradesh main swasthya vibhaag main sanvida yani edock par kaam karne vaale in dinon anishchit kaaleen hadtaal par hai
 They are demanding to be permanent
 kehete hai wo jitna kaam karte hai, utane hi kaam ko permanent karne waalon ko dugana paisa miltaa he
 When these young men were not allowed to set up their tents in Seoni district, they landed in the river Vanga Ganga
 subah saadhe gyaarah baje se lekar shaam chaar baje tak pani main rahete hai
 As long as everyone will fight in different groups, even after going down the river, then the system will not be affected
 ye basic baat samajni hi padegi
 Whether you watch prime time or not
 ye log 12 se 18 saal se kaam kar rahe hai, abhi tak permanent nahin hue hai
 2000 have also been removed in the name of closure of plans and review
 ye log siwani zila aspataal, civil aspataal, saamudayik swasthya seva centre main nurse hai, pharmacist hai, data entry oparator hai
 Our colleague from Uttarakhand Dinesh Mansera has told that there are many different kinds of unemployed movements taking place across the state
 jis tarah se mujhe berojgaar shabd ke bare main gyaan praapt hua usee tarah se dinesh mansera ko ek gyaan praapt hua he
 That is, the government in the state has divided many recruiters into science and art, and has clashed the unemployed among themselves
 jaise railway kii bhartee ko lekar itiai or gair itiai ke chaatr aapas main bhide hue hai
 On February 26, about 30 women performing in front of the Uttarakhand Chief Minister's house were caught and taken to the bus
 un sabake paas nursing main diploma he
 On March 15, 2016, two years before today, an advertisement for 440 female health workers in Uttarakhand was released
 300 or 600 kii fees jamaa kar 6600 se zyada eenem diploma dhari mahilaon ne aavedan kiya
 When the new government came, the category changed
 kaha gaya ki 440 padon par unheen nursing diploma waalon ko mauka milegaa jinhone 12veen main science padhaa he
 Now, with this one decision, 5500 women were dropped out who had studied 12th Arts
 jabaki in mahilaon ne uttarakhand sarkaar se manyata praapt sarkari or privet nursing college se padhane ke liye teen saal main teen se chaar lakh rupee kharch kiye hai
 At that time the government should have made a policy that women passing Arts will not be able to get a nursing degree
 sarkari nursing college main bhi arts or science donon se grajuation karne vaali mahilaon nursing kar sakati hai
 Then why this division in giving jobs
 bahaali kii prakriya ko vivaadit bana dena koi ranneeti lagati he taaki isi main cese mukadmaa hota rahe or time cat jaae
 Did not get a job, now these girls are demonstrating, fighting the case by raising money
 yahi nahin foresti guard, udyaan vibhaag, van nigam kii bhariyon main bhi science or arts kaa bantwaaraa kar diya gaya he
 The unemployed are divided in the same way, what can be better than these conditions
 tata institute of soshal sciensez main paanch dinon se chaatr pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Demonstrations are going on not only in the Mumbai campus but also in the remaining three campuses of Tissus
 prashasan ke saath baithak to hui magar samaadhaan nahin niklaa he
 Will you ever meet the students of Tis, their quality is very good, not only are they qualified in studies, these students have also done amazing work in social service
 par ye pradarshan isliye kar rahe hai kyonki anusuchit jati, janajati or obisi ke chaatro ko milane vaali chaatravrutti kii suvidha bharat sarkaar ne waapas le lee he
 TIS has issued an order that the students of the 2016-18, 2017-19 batch pay tuition fees, hostel fees and dining fees
 in chaatro ko post metric scolership kii suvidha mil rahi thi jo ab band ho gai he
 According to the media report, the Tis administration says that the scholarship has not been withheld
 indian express kii priyanka sahu se baat karne hue tis prashasan ne kaha he ki santhaan apane str par sansaadhan jutaney kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 This is strange logic
 jab sarkaar scolership de rahi thi to wo milani chahie
 Now i will mention a problem that i do not know the solution for
 saansad se lekar chaatro ne kai baar upiessi se kaha magar inkaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 Whenever the form of UPSC comes out, these students get restless in the hope of being given a chance
 taminladu or kerala se bhi chaatro ne sampark kiya tab laga ki baat rakh dete hai
 You know that in 2011, CSAT was applied in UPSC preliminary examination
 ise lekar khub sawaal uthe or bavaal hua
 The students said that the new system is in such a way that students of science, engineering and English medium benefit
 arts ke chaatr peeche rah jaaenge or hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko nuksaan ho
 Once the movement of the CSAT had caught vigor, big leaders came in support of them
 29 janvari 2018 ko upiessi ke saamne chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In 2015, the government removed CSAT from the qualifying round
 sarkaar ne yah bhi faisla kiya ki jin chaatro ne 2011 main pehali baar upiessi kii pariksha di thi unhen ek baar or pariksha dene kaa mauka diya jayega
 But in 2012-13, 2013-14, the students who suffered loss due to CSAT want to get a chance
 unka maananaa he ki sisat jaisi vyavastha ke kaaran unka chance bhi barbaad hua he
 This year, when the students of Jammu and Kashmir were given five years relaxation in the age limit to appear in the UPSC Civil Service Examination, then again these students became hopeful and restless
 inkaa kahana he ki jab siem mahamuba mufti ke prayaas se inhen chhot mil sakati he to hamen kyon nahin mil rahi he
 Perhaps these students are feeling cheated by the way TV presented Kashmir in the name of hindu-muslim debate and they became its customers
 ham nahin jaanate ki upiessi kya faisla legi lekin agar in chaatro ko yahi lagata he ki prime time main uthaa dene bhar se unka kaam ho jayega to yahi sahi
 These students should also ask a question to themselves when the students of other examinations perform, do they go in them, their sorrow hurts them, if the question is not answered then even in prime time, nothing will be done
 
 dua karuunga ki inhen ek chance mil jaae
 i would request that Hindu Muslims play an active role in closing the debate or else they are not young people, who will have to listen to a song with no story
 aap dekh rahe hai naukari series kaa 19waan ank
 The Central Bank of India has not yet given a joining letter to more than 700 students even though the years have passed
 aap hi bataaiye 700 se adhik chaatr pariksha paas kar chuke hai, merit list main aa jane ke baad kaiyon ne naukari chhod di, ab unhen 11 maheene se jwainig letters nahin mil rahaa he
 Don't you think that this is a bigger news than a politically fixing match
 khabaron kaa apana swaad or praathamikta badal lijie varna aapke saath bahut bada dhokhaa hone vaala he balki ho chukaa he
 Allahabad has an Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission office, in front of which students demonstrated last Friday
 ye chaatr ejeeniyar hai
 There was a written examination in 2013 for the recruitment of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer
 jei ke 3222 pad the or assistant ejeeniyar ke 952 pad the
 The advertisement came out in 2013, after three years of written examination on 11-12 April 2016
 jei kii likhit pariksha hui 22-23 may 2016 ko
 Two years have passed since then, but the results have not come
 11 disambar 2017 ko ayog ke saamne in naujavaanon ne pradarshan kiya to likhit aashwaasan mila ki 15 farvari ko assitant ejeeniyar or april main junior ejeeniyar kaa riselt nikaal denge
 It has been 11 days consumed on 15 February
 yah bharat desh main hi ho saktaa he ki 2013 kii pariksha kaa parinaam farvari 2018 tak nahin aayaa he
 That is why i say that the youth of India are very exaggerated while their political quality is very poor
 karaab na hoti to is tarah kii thagi unke saath har rajya main nahin hoti
 My words may seem bad, but they check themselves, my words will be correct
 patna main hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar se shaareerik chunautiyon vaale chaatr milane aae
 You will be disturbed after listening to what they told
 2010 main ye log pariksha paas kar vibhinn padon ke liye chune gaye the
 Their number is 49
 inhone jwine to kiya magar aath maheene baad bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne naukari se hataa diya
 In the same way, he was removed from his job by joining the jail in Jharkhand after two years of training
 kaaran bataaya gaya ki viklaangata aarakshan kaa sahi paalan nahin hua he
 The advertisement for this examination was released in 2010, the result came on 24 August 2013 after three years
 janvari 2014 se lekar agast 2014 tak naukari par rahe magar baad main hataa die gaye
 They have expected from the prime time job series that the government might listen
 aap soch rahe honge ki is desh main adaalat he yaa nahin
 Absolutely the court is there and the Patna High Court also ordered on August 20, 2015 that these 49 handicapped be reinstated
 abhi tak bahaali nahin hui he
 He again went to the High Court and in December 2016 again the High Court said that he should be reinstated
 magar nahin hui
 Do you think that when no one is affected by two orders of the High Court, prime time will matter
 tippaniyan We started the job series with the Staff Selection Commission exam
 pichley episod main hamane zikr kiya tha ki maharashtra cirkil ke postal vibhaag se jwining ke liye 353 noujvaan chitthee kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 We had emphasized Maharashtra Circle in the 17th issue of the Prime Time Job Series
 aaj maharashtra cirkil kii website par posting kii khabar aa gai he
 353 youth have been told whose posting will be in which branch and city
 yah hamaare liye bhi khushi kii baat he
 If a show can affect the lives of 353 students, then i will do the job series by July instead of May
 kya hamaare bharat ke noujvaan ek eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin hasil kar sakate hai, iraadaa kar lenge to hasil bhi kar lenge
 Staff Selection Commission exam is also a good news for the students of CGL 2016
 hamane is pariksha kaa bhi sawaal uthaaya tha ki paas kar chuke naujavaanon ko jwining letters nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The CBDT, an institution of Income Tax Department, was waiting for joining by passing the examination for 1114 posts
 pehle episod main bhi iskaa zikr kiya tha
 After eight months, you will get the letter now
 inakam tex inspector ke pad par jinaki niyukti hui he unhen nirdesh diya jaataa he ve apni pasand kii jagah paane ke liye chunaav karen or farm jamaa karen
 Let us also be asking when is Holi, when is Holi
 
 
 kya hamen ek eemaandaar or behatar pariksha vyavastha nahin chahie, yah kyon hai ki har rajya main yuva pareshaan hai magar kisi rajya main yah sawaal nahin he
 Have the youth decided that their future is just and only from a topic like Hindu Muslim Debate
 agar yuva apni-apni pariksha ko lekar rote rahenge to unke rajya main kabhi ek behatar pariksha vyavastha nahin banegi
 So do not speak for yourself but also for others
 railway aprintis ke chaatr pradarshan karen to van seva vaale bhi usamen jaaen or bipiessi ke chaatr pradarshan karen to usamen banking pariksha vaale bhi jaaen, varna kranti kaa wo gaanaa rose suna kiijie, wo javaani javaani nahin, jisaki koi kahani nahin
 If you do not understand anything, then watch TV less now
 slogan main swarg nahin hota he
 When the poor farmers affected by the Narmada Dam in Madhya Pradesh came out with this method of demonstration, very few of the youth of the state would have supported them, but now when they have passed on themselves, they are stealing the idea of the performance of those farmers
 madhya pradesh main swasthya vibhaag main sanvida yani edock par kaam karne vaale in dinon anishchit kaaleen hadtaal par hai
 They are demanding to be permanent
 kehete hai wo jitna kaam karte hai, utane hi kaam ko permanent karne waalon ko dugana paisa miltaa he
 When these young men were not allowed to set up their tents in Seoni district, they landed in the river Vanga Ganga
 subah saadhe gyaarah baje se lekar shaam chaar baje tak pani main rahete hai
 As long as everyone will fight in different groups, even after going down the river, then the system will not be affected
 ye basic baat samajni hi padegi
 Whether you watch prime time or not
 ye log 12 se 18 saal se kaam kar rahe hai, abhi tak permanent nahin hue hai
 2000 have also been removed in the name of closure of plans and review
 ye log siwani zila aspataal, civil aspataal, saamudayik swasthya seva centre main nurse hai, pharmacist hai, data entry oparator hai

 inakam tex inspector ke pad par jinaki niyukti hui he unhen nirdesh diya jaataa he ve apni pasand kii jagah paane ke liye chunaav karen or farm jamaa karen
 Let us also be asking when is Holi, when is Holi
 
 
 madhya pradesh main narmada baandh se prabhavit garib kisaanon ne jab pradarshan kaa yah tarika nikaala to rajya ke yuvaaon main se kam hi ne unka saath diya hoga lekin ab jab khud par beeti he to un kisaanon ke pradarshan kaa idia churaakar pradarshan kar rahe hai
 These days the workers working on contract in the health department in Madhya Pradesh are on indefinite strike
 ve permanent kiye jane kii maang kar rahe hai
 It is said that the more work they do, the more they receive double the money
 siwani zile main jab in naujavaanon ko apana tambu tak lagane nahin diya gaya to ye wan ganga nadi main utar gaye
 They remain in the water from eleven to half past four in the morning
 jab tak sab alag alag samooh main ladenge nadi ke baad naale main bhi utar jaaenge to bhi system ko fark nahin padegaa
 This basic thing has to be understood
 chaahe aap prime time dekhen yaa na dekhen
 These people have been working for 12 to 18 years, yet have not been cleared
 yojana band karne or kaarysamiksha ke naam par 2000 nikaal bhi die hae hai
 These people are nurses in Suture District Hospital, Civil Hospital, Community Health Service Center, are pharmacists, are data entry operators
 uttarakhand se hamaare sahyogi dinesh mansera ne bataaya he ki rajya bhar main berojgaaron ke alag alag prakaar ke kai andolan ho rahe hai
 Just as i gained knowledge about the term unemployed, in the same way Dinesh Mansera has gained a knowledge
 vah yah ki rajya main sarkaar ne kai bhartiyon ko vigyaan or kala main baant kar berojgaaron ko hi aapas main bhida diya he
 For example, ITI and non-iti students are at loggerheads over the recruitment of Railways
 26 farvari ko uttarakhand mukhyamantri awaas ke saamne pradarshan kar rahi kareeb 30 mahilaon ko pakad kar bas main le jaaya gaya
 They all have diplomas in nursing
 15 march 2016 yani aaj se do saal pehle uttarakhand main mahila swasthya kaaryakarta ke liye 440 padon kaa vigyaapan niklaa
 More than 6600 ANM diploma-holding women applied by depositing fees of 300 and 600
 nai sarkaar ai to category badal gai
 It was said that only those nursing diplomas who have studied science in 12th class will get 440 positions
 ab is ek faisle se 5500 mahilaayein baahar ho gayi jinhone 12veen arts padhaa tha
 Whereas these women have spent three to four lakh rupees in three years to study from government and private nursing colleges recognized by the government of Uttarakhand
 tabhi sarkaar ko yah niti banani chahie thi ki arts se paas hone vaali mahilaayein nursing kii degree nahin le sakati hai
 In the Government Nursing College also, women graduating from both Arts and Science can do nursing
 phir naukari dene main yah bantwaaraa kyon
 There seems to be a strategy to make the restoration process disputed so that the case will continue in the case and time is cut
 naukari mili nahin, ab ye ladkiyaan pradarshan kar rahi hai, paise jutakar cese lard rahi hai
 Not only this, science and arts have also been distributed in the fills of Forest Guard, Horticulture Department, Forest Corporation
 berojgaar vaise hi bante hue hai, in sharton se or bant jaaen isse behatar sthiti kya ho sakati he
 Students have been performing at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences for five days
 mumbai campus hi nahin, tisus ke baaki teen campus main bhi pradarshan chal rahaa he
 There was a meeting with the administration but no solution has been found
 aap kabhi tis ke chaatro se miliega, inaki quality kaaphi acchhee he, padhai main yogya to hai hi, samaaj seva main bhi in chaatro ne kamaal kiya he
 But these demonstrations are happening because the Government of India has withdrawn the scholarships for SC, ST and OBC students
 tis ne aadesh jari kiya he ki 2016-18, 2017-19 batch ke chaatr tution fees, hostel fees or dining fees kaa bhugtan karen
 These students were getting post matric scholarship facility which is now closed
 media report ke anusaar tis prashasan kaa kahana he ki chaatravrutti nahin roki gai he
 Speaking to Priyanka Sahu of Indian Express, Tis administration has said that the institute is trying to raise resources at its level
 yah ajeeb tark he
 It should be met when the government was giving scholarships
 ab ek aisi samasya kaa zikr hoga jiskaa samaadhaan mujhe pataa nahin
 Students from MP to UPSC have told UPSC many times but these are not resolved
 jab bhi upiessi kaa farm nikalataa he ye chaatr ek chance die jane kii ummid main baichaiyn ho uthte hai
 Students from Tamil Nadu and Kerala also contacted, then felt that they would keep the talk
 aap jaanate hai ki 2011 main upiessi kii praarambhik pariksha main sisat lagu kiya gaya tha
 a lot of questions arose and caused ruckus
 chaatro kaa kahana tha ki nai pranali is tarah se he ki science, ejineering or angrezi madhyam ke chaatro ko phayda ho
 Arts students will be left behind and Hindi medium students may suffer
 sisat kaa andolan ne ek baar jor pakadaa tha tab bade bade netaa inke samarthan main aae the
 The students performed in front of UPSC on 29 January 2018
 2015 main sarkaar ne sisat ko qualifing round se hataa diya
 The government also decided that the students who had appeared for the UPSC for the first time in 2011, would be given the chance to take the exam one more time
 lekin 2012-13, 2013-14 main jin chaatro ko sisat ke kaaran nuksaan hua wo chaahate hai ki unhen bhi ek chance mili
 They believe that their chance is also ruined due to a system like CSAT
 is saal jab jammu-kashmir ke chaatro ko upiessi civil sarvice pariksha main baithne ke liye umr seemaa main paanch saal kii chhot di gai to phir se ye chaatr ashanvit ho gaye or baichaiyn bhi
 They say that when CM Mahmuba Mufti's efforts can give them exemption, then why are we not getting them
 shaayad ye chaatr hindu-muslim dibet ke naam par tivi ne kashmir ko jis tarah se pesh kiya or ye uske graahak bane ab thage hue se mahasoos kar rahe hai
 We do not know what the UPSC will decide, but if these students feel that they will be done with a lift in prime time, then it is right
 in chaatro ko ek sawaal khud se bhi poochna chahie jab duusari parikshaon ke chaatr pradarshan karte hai to kya ve unamem jate hai, unke dukhon se unhen takalif hoti he, agar sawaal kaa jawaab naa main he to prime time main bhi uthaane se kuch nahin hoga
 i pray that they get a chance
 guzarish karuunga ki hindu muslim dibet band karaane main sakriy bhoomika adaa karen varna wo javaani javaani nahin jisaki koi kahani nahin vaala gaanaa sunanaa padegaa
 You are watching the 19th issue of the Job Series
 central bank aaf india ne abhi tak 700 se adhik chaatro ko jwining letters nahin diya he jabaki pariksha paas kiye hue saal biit gaye hai
 You tell me, more than 700 students have passed the exam, many have left the job after getting in the merit list, now they are not getting joining letter for 11 months
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki politicil phixing vaale match se kahin zyaada ye badi khabar he
 Change your taste and preference for news, otherwise you are going to be cheated a lot

 On 11 December 2017, these youths demonstrated in front of the Commission and received written assurance that on February 15, the results of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer will be out in April
 15 farvari ko bhasma hue 11 din ho gaye hai
 It may be in India only that the result of the 2013 examination has not come till February 2018

 Students with physical challenges came to meet our colleague Manish Kumar in Patna
 inhone jo haal bataaya wo sunakar aap behaal ho jaaenge
 In 2010, these people passed the exam and were selected for various posts
 inaki sankhya 49 he
 He joined but after eight months, the Bihar Staff Selection Commission removed him from the job
 thik usee tarah jaise jharkhand main daaroga kii do saal kii training dekar, jwining kara kar unhen naukari se hataa diya gaya
 The reason given was that the disability reservation has not been properly followed
 is pariksha kaa vigyaapan 2010 main niklaa tha, teen saal baad 24 agast 2013 ko riselt aayaa tha
 He was employed from January 2014 to August 2014 but was later removed
 inhen prime time kii naukari series se ummid ho gai he ki shaayad sarkaar sun le
 You must be wondering if there is a court in this country
 bilkul adaalat he or patna hoicourt ne 20 agast 2015 ko order bhi diya tha ki in 49 viklangon ko phir se behaal kiya jaae
 Restoration has not yet taken place
 ye dobaaraa hoicourt gaye or disambar 2016 main phir se hai court ne kaha ki inaki bahaali ho
 But it did not happen

 The comments hamane naukari series kii shuruyaat staff salection kamishan kii pariksha se kii thi
 In the last episode, we mentioned that 353 youths were waiting for the letter to join the postal department of Maharashtra Circle
 hamane prime time kii naukari siries ke 17wein ank main maharashtra cirkil par jor diya tha
 Today the news of posting on the website of Maharashtra Circle has arrived
 353 naujavaanon ko bataa diya gaya he ki kiski posting kis branch or shahar main hogi
 It is also a pleasure for us
 agar ek sho se 353 chaatro ke jivan par asar pad saktaa he to naukari series may kii jagah july tak karuunga
 Can not the youth of our India achieve an honest examination system, if we intend, we will also achieve it
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha sijiel 2016 ke chaatro ke liye bhi ek khushkhabari he
 We had also raised the question of this examination that the joining letter is not being given to the youth who have passed
 iskar vibhaag kii sanstha sibiditi ke liye 1114 padon ke liye pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 It was also mentioned in the first episode

 Those who have been appointed to the post of Income Tax Inspector are instructed to elect their place of choice and submit the form

 Our colleague from Uttarakhand Dinesh Mansera has told that there are many different kinds of unemployed movements taking place across the state
 jis tarah se mujhe berojgaar shabd ke bare main gyaan praapt hua usee tarah se dinesh mansera ko ek gyaan praapt hua he
 That is, the government in the state has divided many recruiters into science and art, and has clashed the unemployed among themselves
 jaise railway kii bhartee ko lekar itiai or gair itiai ke chaatr aapas main bhide hue hai
 On February 26, about 30 women performing in front of the Uttarakhand Chief Minister's house were caught and taken to the bus
 un sabake paas nursing main diploma he
 On March 15, 2016, two years before today, an advertisement for 440 female health workers in Uttarakhand was released
 300 or 600 kii fees jamaa kar 6600 se zyada eenem diploma dhari mahilaon ne aavedan kiya
 When the new government came, the category changed
 kaha gaya ki 440 padon par unheen nursing diploma waalon ko mauka milegaa jinhone 12veen main science padhaa he
 Now, with this one decision, 5500 women were dropped out who had studied 12th Arts
 jabaki in mahilaon ne uttarakhand sarkaar se manyata praapt sarkari or privet nursing college se padhane ke liye teen saal main teen se chaar lakh rupee kharch kiye hai
 At that time the government should have made a policy that women passing Arts will not be able to get a nursing degree
 sarkari nursing college main bhi arts or science donon se grajuation karne vaali mahilaon nursing kar sakati hai
 Then why this division in giving jobs
 bahaali kii prakriya ko vivaadit bana dena koi ranneeti lagati he taaki isi main cese mukadmaa hota rahe or time cat jaae
 Did not get a job, now these girls are demonstrating, fighting the case by raising money
 yahi nahin foresti guard, udyaan vibhaag, van nigam kii bhariyon main bhi science or arts kaa bantwaaraa kar diya gaya he
 The unemployed are divided in the same way, what can be better than these conditions
 tata institute of soshal sciensez main paanch dinon se chaatr pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Demonstrations are going on not only in the Mumbai campus but also in the remaining three campuses of Tissus
 prashasan ke saath baithak to hui magar samaadhaan nahin niklaa he
 Will you ever meet the students of Tis, their quality is very good, not only are they qualified in studies, these students have also done amazing work in social service
 par ye pradarshan isliye kar rahe hai kyonki anusuchit jati, janajati or obisi ke chaatro ko milane vaali chaatravrutti kii suvidha bharat sarkaar ne waapas le lee he
 TIS has issued an order that the students of the 2016-18, 2017-19 batch pay tuition fees, hostel fees and dining fees
 in chaatro ko post metric scolership kii suvidha mil rahi thi jo ab band ho gai he
 According to the media report, the Tis administration says that the scholarship has not been withheld
 indian express kii priyanka sahu se baat karne hue tis prashasan ne kaha he ki santhaan apane str par sansaadhan jutaney kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 This is strange logic
 jab sarkaar scolership de rahi thi to wo milani chahie
 Now i will mention a problem that i do not know the solution for
 saansad se lekar chaatro ne kai baar upiessi se kaha magar inkaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 Whenever the form of UPSC comes out, these students get restless in the hope of being given a chance
 taminladu or kerala se bhi chaatro ne sampark kiya tab laga ki baat rakh dete hai
 You know that in 2011, CSAT was applied in UPSC preliminary examination
 ise lekar khub sawaal uthe or bavaal hua
 The students said that the new system is in such a way that students of science, engineering and English medium benefit
 arts ke chaatr peeche rah jaaenge or hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko nuksaan ho
 Once the movement of the CSAT had caught vigor, big leaders came in support of them
 29 janvari 2018 ko upiessi ke saamne chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In 2015, the government removed CSAT from the qualifying round
 sarkaar ne yah bhi faisla kiya ki jin chaatro ne 2011 main pehali baar upiessi kii pariksha di thi unhen ek baar or pariksha dene kaa mauka diya jayega
 But in 2012-13, 2013-14, the students who suffered loss due to CSAT want to get a chance
 unka maananaa he ki sisat jaisi vyavastha ke kaaran unka chance bhi barbaad hua he
 This year, when the students of Jammu and Kashmir were given a five-year relaxation in the age limit to appear in the UPSC Civil Service Examination, these students were again hopeful and restless
 inkaa kahana he ki jab siem mahamuba mufti ke prayaas se inhen chhot mil sakati he to hamen kyon nahin mil rahi he
 Perhaps these students are feeling cheated by the way TV presented Kashmir in the name of hindu-muslim debate and they became its customers
 ham nahin jaanate ki upiessi kya faisla legi lekin agar in chaatro ko yahi lagata he ki prime time main uthaa dene bhar se unka kaam ho jayega to yahi sahi
 These students should also ask a question to themselves when the students of other examinations perform, do they go in them, their sorrow hurts them, if the question is not answered then even in prime time, nothing will be done
 
 dua karuunga ki inhen ek chance mil jaae
 i would request that Hindu Muslims play an active role in closing the debate or else they are not young people, who will have to listen to a song with no story
 aap dekh rahe hai naukari series kaa 19waan ank
 The Central Bank of India has not yet given a joining letter to more than 700 students even though the years have passed
 aap hi bataaiye 700 se adhik chaatr pariksha paas kar chuke hai, merit list main aa jane ke baad kaiyon ne naukari chhod di, ab unhen 11 maheene se jwainig letters nahin mil rahaa he
 Don't you think that this is a bigger news than a politically fixing match
 khabaron kaa apana swaad or praathamikta badal lijie varna aapke saath bahut bada dhokhaa hone vaala he balki ho chukaa he
 Allahabad has an Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission office, in front of which students demonstrated last Friday
 ye chaatr ejeeniyar hai
 There was a written examination in 2013 for the recruitment of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer
 jei ke 3222 pad the or assistant ejeeniyar ke 952 pad the
 The advertisement came out in 2013, after three years of written examination on 11-12 April 2016
 jei kii likhit pariksha hui 22-23 may 2016 ko
 Two years have passed since then, but the results have not come
 11 disambar 2017 ko ayog ke saamne in naujavaanon ne pradarshan kiya to likhit aashwaasan mila ki 15 farvari ko assitant ejeeniyar or april main junior ejeeniyar kaa riselt nikaal denge
 It has been 11 days consumed on 15 February
 yah bharat desh main hi ho saktaa he ki 2013 kii pariksha kaa parinaam farvari 2018 tak nahin aayaa he
 That is why i say that the youth of India are very exaggerated while their political quality is very poor
 karaab na hoti to is tarah kii thagi unke saath har rajya main nahin hoti
 My words may seem bad, but they check themselves, my words will be correct
 patna main hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar se shaareerik chunautiyon vaale chaatr milane aae
 You will be disturbed after listening to what they told
 2010 main ye log pariksha paas kar vibhinn padon ke liye chune gaye the
 Their number is 49
 inhone jwine to kiya magar aath maheene baad bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne naukari se hataa diya
 In the same way, he was removed from his job by joining the jail in Jharkhand after two years of training
 kaaran bataaya gaya ki viklaangata aarakshan kaa sahi paalan nahin hua he
 The advertisement for this examination was released in 2010, the result came on 24 August 2013 after three years
 janvari 2014 se lekar agast 2014 tak naukari par rahe magar baad main hataa die gaye
 They have expected from the prime time job series that the government might listen
 aap soch rahe honge ki is desh main adaalat he yaa nahin
 Absolutely the court is there and the Patna High Court also ordered on August 20, 2015 that these 49 handicapped be reinstated
 abhi tak bahaali nahin hui he
 He again went to the High Court and in December 2016 again the High Court said that he should be reinstated
 magar nahin hui
 Do you think that when no one is affected by two orders of the High Court, prime time will matter
 tippaniyan We started the job series with the Staff Selection Commission exam
 pichley episod main hamane zikr kiya tha ki maharashtra cirkil ke postal vibhaag se jwining ke liye 353 noujvaan chitthee kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 We had emphasized Maharashtra Circle in the 17th issue of the Prime Time Job Series
 aaj maharashtra cirkil kii website par posting kii khabar aa gai he
 353 youth have been told whose posting will be in which branch and city
 yah hamaare liye bhi khushi kii baat he
 If a show can affect the lives of 353 students, then i will do the job series by July instead of May
 kya hamaare bharat ke noujvaan ek eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin hasil kar sakate hai, iraadaa kar lenge to hasil bhi kar lenge
 Staff Selection Commission exam is also a good news for the students of CGL 2016
 hamane is pariksha kaa bhi sawaal uthaaya tha ki paas kar chuke naujavaanon ko jwining letters nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The CBDT, an institution of Income Tax Department, was waiting for joining by passing the examination for 1114 posts
 pehle episod main bhi iskaa zikr kiya tha
 After eight months, you will get the letter now
 inakam tex inspector ke pad par jinaki niyukti hui he unhen nirdesh diya jaataa he ve apni pasand kii jagah paane ke liye chunaav karen or farm jamaa karen
 Let us also be asking when is Holi, when is Holi
 
 
 26 farvari ko uttarakhand mukhyamantri awaas ke saamne pradarshan kar rahi kareeb 30 mahilaon ko pakad kar bas main le jaaya gaya
 They all have diplomas in nursing
 15 march 2016 yani aaj se do saal pehle uttarakhand main mahila swasthya kaaryakarta ke liye 440 padon kaa vigyaapan niklaa
 More than 6600 ANM diploma-holding women applied by depositing fees of 300 and 600
 nai sarkaar ai to category badal gai
 It was said that only those nursing diplomas who have studied science in 12th class will get 440 positions
 ab is ek faisle se 5500 mahilaayein baahar ho gayi jinhone 12veen arts padhaa tha
 Whereas these women have spent three to four lakh rupees in three years to study from government and private nursing colleges recognized by the government of Uttarakhand
 tabhi sarkaar ko yah niti banani chahie thi ki arts se paas hone vaali mahilaayein nursing kii degree nahin le sakati hai
 In the Government Nursing College also, women graduating from both Arts and Science can do nursing
 phir naukari dene main yah bantwaaraa kyon
 There seems to be a strategy to make the restoration process disputed so that the case will continue in the case and time is cut
 naukari mili nahin, ab ye ladkiyaan pradarshan kar rahi hai, paise jutakar cese lard rahi hai
 Not only this, science and arts have also been distributed in the fills of Forest Guard, Horticulture Department, Forest Corporation
 berojgaar vaise hi bante hue hai, in sharton se or bant jaaen isse behatar sthiti kya ho sakati he
 Students have been performing at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences for five days
 mumbai campus hi nahin, tisus ke baaki teen campus main bhi pradarshan chal rahaa he
 There was a meeting with the administration but no solution has been found
 aap kabhi tis ke chaatro se miliega, inaki quality kaaphi acchhee he, padhai main yogya to hai hi, samaaj seva main bhi in chaatro ne kamaal kiya he
 But these demonstrations are happening because the Government of India has withdrawn the scholarships for SC, ST and OBC students
 tis ne aadesh jari kiya he ki 2016-18, 2017-19 batch ke chaatr tution fees, hostel fees or dining fees kaa bhugtan karen
 These students were getting post matric scholarship facility which is now closed
 media report ke anusaar tis prashasan kaa kahana he ki chaatravrutti nahin roki gai he
 Speaking to Priyanka Sahu of Indian Express, Tis administration has said that the institute is trying to raise resources at its level
 yah ajeeb tark he
 It should be met when the government was giving scholarships
 ab ek aisi samasya kaa zikr hoga jiskaa samaadhaan mujhe pataa nahin
 Students from MP to UPSC have told UPSC many times but these are not resolved
 jab bhi upiessi kaa farm nikalataa he ye chaatr ek chance die jane kii ummid main baichaiyn ho uthte hai
 Students from Tamil Nadu and Kerala also contacted, then felt that they would keep the talk
 aap jaanate hai ki 2011 main upiessi kii praarambhik pariksha main sisat lagu kiya gaya tha
 a lot of questions arose and caused ruckus
 chaatro kaa kahana tha ki nai pranali is tarah se he ki science, ejineering or angrezi madhyam ke chaatro ko phayda ho
 Arts students will be left behind and Hindi medium students may suffer
 sisat kaa andolan ne ek baar jor pakadaa tha tab bade bade netaa inke samarthan main aae the
 The students performed in front of UPSC on 29 January 2018
 2015 main sarkaar ne sisat ko qualifing round se hataa diya
 The government also decided that the students who had appeared for the UPSC for the first time in 2011, would be given the chance to take the exam one more time
 lekin 2012-13, 2013-14 main jin chaatro ko sisat ke kaaran nuksaan hua wo chaahate hai ki unhen bhi ek chance mili
 They believe that their chance is also ruined due to a system like CSAT
 is saal jab jammu-kashmir ke chaatro ko upiessi civil sarvice pariksha main baithne ke liye umr seemaa main paanch saal kii chhot di gai to phir se ye chaatr ashanvit ho gaye or baichaiyn bhi
 They say that when CM Mahmuba Mufti's efforts can give them exemption, then why are we not getting them
 shaayad ye chaatr hindu-muslim dibet ke naam par tivi ne kashmir ko jis tarah se pesh kiya or ye uske graahak bane ab thage hue se mahasoos kar rahe hai
 We do not know what the UPSC will decide, but if these students feel that they will be done with a lift in prime time, then it is right
 in chaatro ko ek sawaal khud se bhi poochna chahie jab duusari parikshaon ke chaatr pradarshan karte hai to kya ve unamem jate hai, unke dukhon se unhen takalif hoti he, agar sawaal kaa jawaab naa main he to prime time main bhi uthaane se kuch nahin hoga
 i pray that they get a chance
 guzarish karuunga ki hindu muslim dibet band karaane main sakriy bhoomika adaa karen varna wo javaani javaani nahin jisaki koi kahani nahin vaala gaanaa sunanaa padegaa
 You are watching the 19th issue of the Job Series
 central bank aaf india ne abhi tak 700 se adhik chaatro ko jwining letters nahin diya he jabaki pariksha paas kiye hue saal biit gaye hai
 You tell me, more than 700 students have passed the exam, many have left the job after getting in the merit list, now they are not getting joining letter for 11 months
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki politicil phixing vaale match se kahin zyaada ye badi khabar he
 Change your taste and preference for news, otherwise you are going to be cheated a lot

 inhen prime time kii naukari series se ummid ho gai he ki shaayad sarkaar sun le
 You must be wondering if there is a court in this country
 bilkul adaalat he or patna hoicourt ne 20 agast 2015 ko order bhi diya tha ki in 49 viklangon ko phir se behaal kiya jaae
 Restoration has not yet taken place
 ye dobaaraa hoicourt gaye or disambar 2016 main phir se hai court ne kaha ki inaki bahaali ho
 But it did not happen
 aapako lagata he ki hoicourt ke do do adeshon se jab kisi ko fark nahin padaa to prime time se fark padegaa
 The comments hamane naukari series kii shuruyaat staff salection kamishan kii pariksha se kii thi
 In the last episode, we mentioned that 353 youths were waiting for the letter to join the postal department of Maharashtra Circle
 hamane prime time kii naukari siries ke 17wein ank main maharashtra cirkil par jor diya tha
 Today the news of posting on the website of Maharashtra Circle has arrived
 353 naujavaanon ko bataa diya gaya he ki kiski posting kis branch or shahar main hogi
 It is also a pleasure for us
 agar ek sho se 353 chaatro ke jivan par asar pad saktaa he to naukari series may kii jagah july tak karuunga
 Can not the youth of our India achieve an honest examination system, if we intend, we will also achieve it
 staff salection kamishan kii pariksha sijiel 2016 ke chaatro ke liye bhi ek khushkhabari he
 We had also raised the question of this examination that the joining letter is not being given to the youth who have passed
 iskar vibhaag kii sanstha sibiditi ke liye 1114 padon ke liye pariksha paas kar jwining kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 It was also mentioned in the first episode
 aath maheene baad ab chitthee milegi
 Those who have been appointed to the post of Income Tax Inspector are instructed to elect their place of choice and submit the form
 chaliye ye bhi puch rahe honge ki holi kab he, kab he holi
 
 
 Now i will mention a problem that i do not know the solution for
 saansad se lekar chaatro ne kai baar upiessi se kaha magar inkaa samaadhaan nahin hota
 Whenever the form of UPSC comes out, these students get restless in the hope of being given a chance
 taminladu or kerala se bhi chaatro ne sampark kiya tab laga ki baat rakh dete hai
 You know that in 2011, CSAT was applied in UPSC preliminary examination
 ise lekar khub sawaal uthe or bavaal hua
 The students said that the new system is in such a way that students of science, engineering and English medium benefit
 arts ke chaatr peeche rah jaaenge or hindi madhyam ke chaatro ko nuksaan ho
 Once the movement of the CSAT had caught vigor, big leaders came in support of them
 29 janvari 2018 ko upiessi ke saamne chaatro ne pradarshan kiya tha
 In 2015, the government removed CSAT from the qualifying round
 sarkaar ne yah bhi faisla kiya ki jin chaatro ne 2011 main pehali baar upiessi kii pariksha di thi unhen ek baar or pariksha dene kaa mauka diya jayega
 But in 2012-13, 2013-14, the students who suffered loss due to CSAT want to get a chance
 unka maananaa he ki sisat jaisi vyavastha ke kaaran unka chance bhi barbaad hua he
 This year, when the students of Jammu and Kashmir were given a five-year relaxation in the age limit to appear in the UPSC Civil Service Examination, these students were again hopeful and restless
 inkaa kahana he ki jab siem mahamuba mufti ke prayaas se inhen chhot mil sakati he to hamen kyon nahin mil rahi he
 Perhaps these students are feeling cheated by the way TV presented Kashmir in the name of hindu-muslim debate and they became its customers
 ham nahin jaanate ki upiessi kya faisla legi lekin agar in chaatro ko yahi lagata he ki prime time main uthaa dene bhar se unka kaam ho jayega to yahi sahi
 These students should also ask a question to themselves when the students of other examinations perform, do they go in them, their sorrow hurts them, if the question is not answered then even in prime time, nothing will be done
 
 dua karuunga ki inhen ek chance mil jaae
 i would request that Hindu Muslims play an active role in closing the debate or else they are not young people, who will have to listen to a song with no story
 aap dekh rahe hai naukari series kaa 19waan ank
 The Central Bank of India has not yet given a joining letter to more than 700 students even though the years have passed
 aap hi bataaiye 700 se adhik chaatr pariksha paas kar chuke hai, merit list main aa jane ke baad kaiyon ne naukari chhod di, ab unhen 11 maheene se jwainig letters nahin mil rahaa he
 Don't you think that this is a bigger news than a politically fixing match
 khabaron kaa apana swaad or praathamikta badal lijie varna aapke saath bahut bada dhokhaa hone vaala he balki ho chukaa he
 Allahabad has an Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission office, in front of which students demonstrated last Friday
 ye chaatr ejeeniyar hai
 There was a written examination in 2013 for the recruitment of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer
 jei ke 3222 pad the or assistant ejeeniyar ke 952 pad the
 The advertisement came out in 2013, after three years of written examination on 11-12 April 2016
 jei kii likhit pariksha hui 22-23 may 2016 ko
 Two years have passed since then, but the results have not come
 11 disambar 2017 ko ayog ke saamne in naujavaanon ne pradarshan kiya to likhit aashwaasan mila ki 15 farvari ko assitant ejeeniyar or april main junior ejeeniyar kaa riselt nikaal denge
 It has been 11 days consumed on 15 February
 yah bharat desh main hi ho saktaa he ki 2013 kii pariksha kaa parinaam farvari 2018 tak nahin aayaa he
 That is why i say that the youth of India are very exaggerated while their political quality is very poor
 karaab na hoti to is tarah kii thagi unke saath har rajya main nahin hoti
 My words may seem bad, but they check themselves, my words will be correct
 patna main hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar se shaareerik chunautiyon vaale chaatr milane aae
 You will be disturbed after listening to what they told
 2010 main ye log pariksha paas kar vibhinn padon ke liye chune gaye the
 Their number is 49
 inhone jwine to kiya magar aath maheene baad bihar karmchaaree chayan ayog ne naukari se hataa diya
 In the same way, he was removed from his job by joining the jail in Jharkhand after two years of training
 kaaran bataaya gaya ki viklaangata aarakshan kaa sahi paalan nahin hua he
 The advertisement for this examination was released in 2010, the result came on 24 August 2013 after three years
 janvari 2014 se lekar agast 2014 tak naukari par rahe magar baad main hataa die gaye
 They have expected from the prime time job series that the government might listen
 aap soch rahe honge ki is desh main adaalat he yaa nahin
 Absolutely the court is there and the Patna High Court also ordered on August 20, 2015 that these 49 handicapped be reinstated
 abhi tak bahaali nahin hui he
 He again went to the High Court and in December 2016 again the High Court said that he should be reinstated
 magar nahin hui
 Do you think that when no one is affected by two orders of the High Court, prime time will matter
 tippaniyan We started the job series with the Staff Selection Commission exam
 pichley episod main hamane zikr kiya tha ki maharashtra cirkil ke postal vibhaag se jwining ke liye 353 noujvaan chitthee kaa intazaar kar rahe the
 We had emphasized Maharashtra Circle in the 17th issue of the Prime Time Job Series
 aaj maharashtra cirkil kii website par posting kii khabar aa gai he
 353 youth have been told whose posting will be in which branch and city
 yah hamaare liye bhi khushi kii baat he
 If a show can affect the lives of 353 students, then i will do the job series by July instead of May
 kya hamaare bharat ke noujvaan ek eemaandaar pariksha vyavastha nahin hasil kar sakate hai, iraadaa kar lenge to hasil bhi kar lenge
 Staff Selection Commission exam is also a good news for the students of CGL 2016
 hamane is pariksha kaa bhi sawaal uthaaya tha ki paas kar chuke naujavaanon ko jwining letters nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The CBDT, an institution of Income Tax Department, was waiting for joining by passing the examination for 1114 posts
 pehle episod main bhi iskaa zikr kiya tha
 After eight months, you will get the letter now
 inakam tex inspector ke pad par jinaki niyukti hui he unhen nirdesh diya jaataa he ve apni pasand kii jagah paane ke liye chunaav karen or farm jamaa karen
 Let us also be asking when is Holi, when is Holi
 
 
 sisat kaa andolan ne ek baar jor pakadaa tha tab bade bade netaa inke samarthan main aae the
 The students performed in front of UPSC on 29 January 2018
 2015 main sarkaar ne sisat ko qualifing round se hataa diya
 The government also decided that the students who had appeared for the UPSC for the first time in 2011, would be given the chance to take the exam one more time
 lekin 2012-13, 2013-14 main jin chaatro ko sisat ke kaaran nuksaan hua wo chaahate hai ki unhen bhi ek chance mili
 They believe that their chance is also ruined due to a system like CSAT
 is saal jab jammu-kashmir ke chaatro ko upiessi civil sarvice pariksha main baithne ke liye umr seemaa main paanch saal kii chhot di gai to phir se ye chaatr ashanvit ho gaye or baichaiyn bhi
 They say that when CM Mahmuba Mufti's efforts can give them exemption, then why are we not getting them
 shaayad ye chaatr hindu-muslim dibet ke naam par tivi ne kashmir ko jis tarah se pesh kiya or ye uske graahak bane ab thage hue se mahasoos kar rahe hai
 We do not know what the UPSC will decide, but if these students feel that they will be done with a lift in prime time, then it is right
 in chaatro ko ek sawaal khud se bhi poochna chahie jab duusari parikshaon ke chaatr pradarshan karte hai to kya ve unamem jate hai, unke dukhon se unhen takalif hoti he, agar sawaal kaa jawaab naa main he to prime time main bhi uthaane se kuch nahin hoga
 i pray that they get a chance
 guzarish karuunga ki hindu muslim dibet band karaane main sakriy bhoomika adaa karen varna wo javaani javaani nahin jisaki koi kahani nahin vaala gaanaa sunanaa padegaa
 You are watching the 19th issue of the Job Series
 central bank aaf india ne abhi tak 700 se adhik chaatro ko jwining letters nahin diya he jabaki pariksha paas kiye hue saal biit gaye hai
 You tell me, more than 700 students have passed the exam, many have left the job after getting in the merit list, now they are not getting joining letter for 11 months
 kya aapako nahin lagata ki politicil phixing vaale match se kahin zyaada ye badi khabar he
 Change your taste and preference for news, otherwise you are going to be cheated a lot
 elahabaad main uttar pradesh lok seva ayog kaa daftar he, iske saamne chaatro ne pichley shuukravaar ko pradarshan kiya
 These students are engineers

 The written examination of JE took place on 22-23 May 2016
 iske baad se do saal biit gaya magar riselt nahin aayaa he
 On 11 December 2017, these youths demonstrated in front of the Commission and received written assurance that on February 15, the results of Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer will be out in April
 15 farvari ko bhasma hue 11 din ho gaye hai
 It may be in India only that the result of the 2013 examination has not come till February 2018
 tabhi main kahata hum bharat ke naujavaanon ko kaaphi badha chadha kar pesh kiya jaataa he jabaki inaki polytical quality bahut karaab he
 If it was not bad, such a fraud would not happen to them in every state
 meri baat buree lag sakati he magar ve khud se check kar len meri hi baat sahi lagegi
 Students with physical challenges came to meet our colleague Manish Kumar in Patna
 inhone jo haal bataaya wo sunakar aap behaal ho jaaenge
 In 2010, these people passed the exam and were selected for various posts
 inaki sankhya 49 he
 He joined but after eight months, the Bihar Staff Selection Commission removed him from the job
 thik usee tarah jaise jharkhand main daaroga kii do saal kii training dekar, jwining kara kar unhen naukari se hataa diya gaya
 The reason given was that the disability reservation has not been properly followed

 peedita ke maa-baap ne doshiyon ke liye faansee kii sajaa kii maang kii thi
 Details of the entire incident: In February 2012, 19-year-old Kiran, a resident of Chawla, was returning home from Gurgaon with some of her friends
 isi vakt teen badmaashon use car main jabaran agava kar le gaye
 After this incident, his family got the first shock when the police arrived almost an hour late, despite all the requests, forced themselves to quickly find the miscreants
 vajah yah ki rajdhani kii police ke paas badmaashon ko dhundhane nikalne ke liye ek adad gaadi tak nahin thi
 Here, as the time passed, the girl who was abducted was growing more and more
 kiran ko uthaane ke baad badmaash use car main lekar andruni raaston se hote hue dilli se haryana ja pahunche
 Since all these boys were residents of the same place and by profession, they knew many other ways to escape from the police
 doshiyon ne pehle to ek theke se ruuk kar sharaab kharidi or phir car ko sunsaan jagah par le jaakar sharaab pite hue kiran ke saath jyaadati kii
 Badharan Kiran asked for water to drink, then another face of these madmen appeared
 pehle to teenon use lekar pani kii talash main nikle or ek jagah rakhe ghade se pani bhi pilaayaa lekin iske baad in teenon main se ek ladke ke dimaag main jo baat ai, usne ab tak balaatkaari ban chuke in ladakon ko qaatil bhi bana diya
 After the death of an innocent, these boys first gave him water and in the meantime, when one gave the idea of killing him, the trio resurrected
 in ladakon ne use jis ghade se pani pilaayaa tha, sabase pehle vahi gadaa uthaa kar uske sir par de maaraa or iske baad teenon ne ladki ke saath jo kuch kiya, use sunate hi kisi ko bhi uski dard kii shiddat kaa ahsaas hone lagegaa
 One of the three turned and brought an iron pick and a jack out of the car and with these tools, he inflicted several heavy blows on the girl's head
 ladki pehali hi waar se ladki jameen par gir kar tadapane lagi lekin ladakon ko us par raham nahin ai
 After this, they not only attacked him several times, but instead burned the corpse and heated it with tools from the vehicle silencer and fired it
 lekin vahshat kii intahaa abhi baaki thi
 After this, the boys broke the beer bottle and kept biting the girl's entire body until it became lifeless
 police ke saamne khud ladakon kaa kubulanamaa yah kahata he ki unhone tasalli ke liye kai waar to uski maut ke baad bhi kiye or phir laash ko maukey par hi chhod kar bhaag nikle
 But finally, the police got the first evidence due to the make of their car and the location of the mobile phone and the culprits were arrested
 kai log to yah bhi kah rahe hai ki unke rielity sho main janaa chahie
 So many people are praying for his family to be happy like this

 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral claim is completely false

 vah bhi ek uttar he
 Our history will tell you

 unhone kaha ki yah dalon kii nitiyon or kaaryakramon tathaa kisi vishesh samay main maujuuda sthiti par bhi nirbhar karata he
 Yechury said, 'we have to see what kind of situation happens

 ’ input language input- bhashaa Separate rhetoric of its leaders on Balochistan led to the disgrace of the Congress party and the party came backfoot on this issue

 Whose Prime Minister took full political advantage
 vahaan party isi baat par khush ho gayi ki, hamane sarkaar ko bahes karne ke liye majaboor kar liya
 But PM responded to Home Minister Rajnath Singh and stayed away from himself
 isi main sarvadaleey baithak kaa aanan fanan main elaan ho gaya or agle hi din baithak bhi ho gayi
 The PM achieved Iqbal by meeting leaders of all parties, and finally mentioned Balochistan in his speech

 asaram baapu or unke bete narayan sai pakade to gaye yon shoshan or balaatkaar ke iljaam main
 But when the investigation started, it was found that both were actually Dhanna Seth in disguise of the monk
 aisa nahin hota to jaraa sochie ek sadhu 800 bank khate kyon kholegaa? in khaaton se kareeb chaar hajaar karod rupee kaise nikalegaa? do sau karod se zyada kii videshi karansi kii len-dein kyon karegaa? ye to aapako baap-bete kii daulat kii halaki si jhalak bhar he varanaa daulat kaa aankada to das hajaar karod yaa usase bhi upar ja rahaa he
 It is not about Ambani or Bill Gates nor the other rich people of the world
 asaram baapu or unka betaa narayan sai barason se baba kaa chola odhe bhakton ko moksh kaa rasta dikhaate aa rahe hai
 We have been giving knowledge about moh-maya, this couple of father and son fed such a gulp and made such rounds that Daulat also came in their own house and started raining in their own house
 asaram ke ek hi kamare se maano kuber kaa khajaana nikal aayaa ho
 Nine-ten thousand crore rupees was received from only one room in a house
 jabaki apane baba or unke bete kaa ashram or ghar desh ke naa jene kitne rajyon or shahro main hai
 When the doors of those rooms open, where will this 9-10 thousand crore address not go? darasal surat police ne narayan sai kii faraari ke dauraan oktober main ahmedabad main uske ashram par chapa maaraa tha
 During the raid, a total of 42 bags of papers, six computers and a CPU were found from his room
 kagajaat itane zyada the ki jaanch main do maheene se zyada kaa vakt lag gaya
 But as soon as the secret hidden in the papers and computer from the sacks came out, the Surat police were also surprised
 ek sadhu-sant ke paas itani daulat? jise sirf ginaney or samajhane main do maheene se zyada kaa vakt lag jaae? or kamaal ye ki ginati ag bhi puri nahin hui he
 You can not imagine where these people invested those money to make money from money? Just go on thinking about your name, your investment will be found there
 dusron ko moh-maaya se dur rahane kaa gyaan dene vaale baap-bete ne apane bhavishya ko surakshit banane ke liye har us jagah investment kiya jahaan-jahaan isaki gunjaaish tha
 Not only this, the father and son's bank accounts also opened the secret that they used to give money on loans to people
 phir us paise se bijness main laabh hota to sood ke alaava us laabh main se bhi hissaa lete
 It is not just about investment or loan
 boriyon ne jo kagajaat ugale or computer ne jo raaj khole, usne to police kii ankhen or chondhiya deen
 Because now the truth that came out was really revealing the cleverness of father and son
 police ko baap-bete ke jo hisaab-kitaab mili hai usase saaf pataa chalata he ki donon sadhu ke saath-saath behtareen bijnesaman bhi the
 People used to give money on loan and then along with interest on that money, they used to participate in it if there was profit in the business
 police ke anusaar baap-bete ke paas se jo sampatti mili he uske baad ab desh kii kai agenciyaan ek saath donon se hisaab-kitaab maangengi
 The father-son had opened almost the entire bank inside six computers
 in computaron main desh ke kareeb-kareeb sabhi bainkon ke aath sau khaaton kaa zikr tha
 All accounts are in the name of Asaram and Narayan Sai's close relatives, servants and seekers
 haalanki in khaaton kaa istemaal hota sirf asaram or narayan sai ke liye tha
 On checking the bank accounts, it was found that between three and a half thousand and four thousand crores of money have been withdrawn or deposited from these accounts so far
 khaaton or kagajaat kii jaanch main police ko jo sabase chaunkaane vaali cheez mili wo thi videshi karansi kii len-dein
 The police papers prove that the father-son has also manipulated foreign currency worth nearly two hundred crores
 surat police ke mutabik baap-bete ke paas sabase zyada sampatti jameen ke taur par he
 Its price cannot be estimated right now
 kyonki ye jameen gujarat, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, maharashtra or naa jane kin-kin ilaake main hai
 According to the police, most of the land is either benami or those whose land is taken from them keeping them in confusion
 police ke mutabik sambandhit vibhaag ko jaanch ke liye jameen ke kagajaat bhej die gaye he
 Now he will find out when the land was purchased and what will be its value
 kamaal dekhie ki baap betaa donon is vakt jail main hai or wo bhi yon shoshan or balaatkaar ke iljaam main
 But after the sacks that have grown, both are now wrapped in many more streams
 bhrashtachar ke saath-saath ab inakam tex, revenue department, femaa or naa jane kin-kin vibhaag ke koun-koun se section judne ja rahe hai

 Jayalalithaa suffered a heart attack late Sunday evening after which she has been put on life support system
 specialist doctoron kii team mukhyamantri ke ilaaj main juty he or unki tabiyat par najar banaae hue he
 After Jayalalithaa's health deteriorated again, a statement was issued by the Apollo Hospital in Chennai that the Chief Minister was placed on the ECMO
 jaanate hai ki aakhir ye isiemo kya he?1
 ECMO stands for Extra Corporal Membrane Oxygenation
 yah heart acist divaais he
 2
 yah acemedical prakriyaahai jise marij ke sharir ke baahar se hi apanaai jaati he
 That is, there is no such thing as an operation
 3
 The patient needs it when his heart and lungs are unable to produce sufficient amount of oxygen so that the patient can stay alive
 4
 The ECMO process has to start only when the heart or lungs stop functioning and are difficult to handle in any other way
 5
 In this process, the heart assist device removes blood from the patient's body, eliminates the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood and pumps oxygen into the red blood cells so that life-giving blood reaches the patient's body and keeps it alive
 6
 This blood is pumped directly into the patient's body so that the body reaches the energy because the heart and lungs are unable to pump blood which keeps the man alive
 7
 If the respiratory system does not work, the patient is very likely to survive after being placed on ECMO

 Abhijeet Banerjee, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics along with his wife Esther Duffalo, met the Prime Minister on Tuesday
 mulaakaat ke baad abhijit banerjee ne aarthik mandi par bolne se inkaar kar diya
 Although he said that the banking sector is in trouble, the situation is scary and we need to be more careful
 abhijit banerjee ne kaha ki vyavastha ko zyada chaukas hona padegaa taaki kisi bhi bank main sankat aane se pehle use roka ja sake
 He said that in the name of investigating bank default cases, the crisis is getting deeper in the banks due to interference of institutions like CVC
 unhone bainkon main sarkaar kii hissedari 50% se ghataane kaa sawaal bhi uthaa diya he
 In fact, Abhijeet Banerjee has raised questions on corporate tax cuts after winning the award and cited the pressure in the agriculture sector and GST for the slowdown
 dilli main apni pehle media brifing main abhijit banerjee ne kaha ki sarkaar ko bainkon main apni hissedari 50% se kam kerani chaiye jisase kendriya satarkta ayog (central Vigilance Commission) jaanch ke naam par hastkshep naa kar sake
 Abhijeet Banerjee said, "at present, the Central Vigilance Commission can investigate cases of bank defaulters only if the government's holding in that bank is more than 50%
 mere khyaal main sarkaar kii bainkon main hissedari 50% se kam honi chahie taaki jaanch kaa dar banking system ko sakate main na daal de
 "between the economic downturn and the PMC bank scam, Abhijeet Banerjee has sparked a new debate by suggesting that the government's stake in banks be reduced by 50%
 wo chaahate hai ki bainkon ke kaamkaaj main bahari hastkshep kam hona chaiye
 Now it has to be seen what the government takes on their suggestion

 ) Friday the 13th: shuukravaar kii 13 taarikh (friday the 13th) ko behad durbhaagyashaalee mana jaataa he
 Regardless of whether you believe in superstitions or not, there are many people in the world who believe that the 13th is especially bad on Friday
 haalanki in sabake peeche koi vaigyanik aadhaar nahin he
 However, here we are telling you why the 13th of last Friday is considered unlucky
 13 friday ke saath-saath ise 'blike friday' (black Friday 2019) bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is said that Friday the 13th is considered inauspicious since Bible times
 kuch log kehete hai ki isa messiah ne apana aakhri sapar yani ki raat kaa bhojan 13 logon ke saath kiya tha or agle din unki maut ho gai thi
 It is also believed that 13 guests came during the time of Lord Jesus
 aisi manyata he ki ye 13 log vishwasghaatee the or un logon kii vajah se hi prabhu ishu ke saath itani badi ghatana hui thi
 There is one more thing about this day
 jisaki kaaphi charchaa hoti he
 The Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, together with the King of France, sentences a monastic military order
 jise nits templer ke rup main janaa jaataa tha or unke netaa ne yatnaa dene ke saath hi cross par chadhane kaa aadesh diya
 Not only this, it is believed that Jesus was crucified on Friday
 is vajah se agar 13 taarikh or shuukravaar kabhi mil jate hai to wo durbhaagya paidaa karte hai

 ajtak-oarji survey main anna hajaare va unke janalokapal ke bare main logon ne bebaaki se apni raay rakhi he
 Anna Hazare has once again made a proclamation against corruption
 majboot lokapal ke liye 16 agast se anna hajaare phir karenge anshan, lekin kya desh is elaan-e-jang ke saath he
 Is the country ready for Anna's fast? What do the people of the country think about the government's Lokpal Bill? Aaj Tak has done an important survey just before Anna's fast
 ajtak ne desh kii janata kii kabj tatoli he
 The Aaj tak-org survey conducted in 10 cities has yielded very interesting results
 15 agast ko desh aazaadee kaa jashn manayega or jashn ke thik ek din baad shuru hogi bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ek nai jang
 The voice for the country's independence from corruption will be raised again
 anna hajaare kaa elaan he ki lokapal ke masale par ve anshan shuru karenge
 The fast will continue till the government agrees to their demands
 sarkaar aisa lokapal banane kaa bharosa nahin detii, jisase desh ko bhrashtachar ke kalank se chhutkaaraa mil sake, desh sachmuch bhrashtachar se puri tarah aaazaad ho sake
 All the questions related to the issue of ending Lokpal and corruption before the people of the country
 ye survey haal hi main kiya gaya he
 The survey was conducted between 7 August and 12 August

 piem lokapal ke daayre main hon yaa nahin, hayer jeudiciri lokapal ke daayre main ho yaa nahin? in sawaalon par desh anna ke saath he yaa sarkaar ke saath
 Anna Hazare raised his voice, pressure on the government to implement the Lokpal Bill in the country to eliminate corruption, then the government made a draft of the Lokpal Bill and presented it in the House, but is the people of the country satisfied with the government's Lokpal Bill The Or is the government ombudsman just a show-off? a survey conducted in 10 big cities of the country asked: 1
 kya pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main hona chahie?desh kii 75 fisadi janata kii raay he ki pradhanmantri ko lokapal ke daayre main hona chahie? sirf 18 fisadi janata ne kaha nahin or 7 fisadi janata ne kaha maaloom nahin
 Anna's demand has received tremendous support in all the major cities of the country - Bangalore, Bhopal, Chennai, Delhi Hyderabad, Kolkata
 sirf ahmedabad auki patna ke logon ne lokapal ke daayre main pradhanmantri ko rakhane kii anna kii maang ko kam samarthan diya

 kya ucch nyaaypalika yani hair jeudiciri ko lokapal ke daayre main hona chahie?iske jawaab main bhi 75 fisadi janata ne kaha haa, or 17 fisadi janata ne kaha nahin or 8 fisadi janata ne koi raay nahin di

 dilli bijepi adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne aam aadmi party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par tanj kasate hae kaha he ki jo log har kaam apurna karte hai wo aaj purna rajya kii maang kar rahe hai or kushasan se dhyaan hataane ke liye kejariwal kaa yah raajnneetik naatak kar rahe hai
 Manoj Tiwari said that the people of Delhi are troubled by water, power shortage, plight of government hospitals and corruption of Delhi government departments on one hand and Kejriwal is chanting full statehood to divert attention from it
 kushasan se dhyaan hataane kii sajizunhone aarope lagaaya ki aam aadmi party dwaara dilli kopurna rajya kaa darjadilwane kii maang apane kushasan or niskriyata se janata kaa dhyaan bhatakaane ke liye kejariwal kaa ek raajnneetik naatak he

 Silent silence on bjp's stance, he alleged that in the current federal system, the Lieutenant Governor is curbing the corrupt governance of Kejriwal government, whereas the government has not done any development work in three years, so now Kejriwal government has shifted attention by demanding full statehood
 Has been unhone yah bhi kaha ki jis sangheey dhaanche par kejariwal lagaataar khud ko laachaar bataa rahe hai usee dhaanche main bijepi or congress ne sarkarein chalaai hai or dilli ke vikaas par dhyaan diya he jisaki tasviir metro or behtareen fliowaron ke jaal ke rup main dekhi ja sakati he
 However, he did not give a straight answer to whether the BJP is ready for full statehood to Delhi and said that Kejriwal should call an All Party Meet for this which will be reviewed

 The process of bringing the ordinance is democratic in itself
 adhyadesh uchit he yaa nahin he, badi sankhya main adhyadesh jari karnaa manovaigyanik asar kharaab hota he
 People feel that the government is following the ordinance
 ' In 1950, the first speaker of the Lok Sabha, GV Mavalankar, said this while criticizing Jawaharlal Nehru
 adhyadesh ko lekar indinon congress bijepi ke bich aae din bahes ho jaati he

 congress kahati he ki modi sarkaar sansad se bachanaa chaahati he isliye adhyadesh laana chaahati he
 BJP says that you did the same
 is bahes se aapako yah nahin pataa chalata ki adhyadesh ko lekar sanvaidhanik sthiti kya he
 In the Indian Express on 6 January, Faizan Mustafa, Vice Chancellor of Nalsar University of Law, wrote an article on the ordinance which, upon passing, suggests that the politics of ordinances should go beyond the Congress BJP
 faizan mustafaa se is bare main lambii baatcheet hui jisase mujhe yah lekh likhane main kaaphi madad mili
 It is true that between 1952 and 2014, the central government has issued 668 ordinances
 lekin sirf yahi ek tathy sahi nahin he
 The ordinance is against democracy
 pehle spikar se lekar supreme court tak sab kah chuke hai
 The condition of the state governments will be worse but due to lack of adequate research, no one has the right data

 Faizan Mustafa Saheb told me that DC Badhwa of Pune was studying the land laws of Bihar

 Wadhwa Sahib started researching ordinances
 unhen pataa chalaa ki 1967 se 1981 ke bich bihar main 256 adhyadesh jari hue jabaki vidhansabha ne 189 kanoon hi banaae
 This was a terrible situation
 itnaa hi nahin 18 janvari 1986 ko bihar ke rajyapal jagannatha kaushal ne ek din main 58 adhyadesh jari kiya tha
 This may be a record in itself, but for this it is important that you also know the status of the ordinances in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh to Gujarat and Kerala
 tippaniyan Wadhwa Saheb, however, sued the Supreme Court on the basis of his research
 bahes ke baad supreme court ne 1987 main vyavastha di ki jab tak bahut apaat sthiti na ho adhyadesh dobaaraa jari nahin hona chahie

 You do not know from this debate what is the constitutional position regarding the ordinance

 i had a long conversation with Faizan Mustafa which helped me a lot in writing this article
 yah sahi he ki centre sarkaar ne 1952 se lekar 2014 ke bich 668 adhyadesh jari kiye hai
 But this is not the only fact
 adhyadesh loktantr ke khilaaf he
 Everyone has spoken from the first speaker to the Supreme Court
 rajya sarkaron kii haalat to or bhi buree hogi lekin paryaapt shodh na hone ke kaaran kisi ke paas sahi aankade nahin he
 If you are interested in this debate and the government is also fighting over the Gahebahga ordinance, then now it should be told state-wise that in which state the ordinance is issued more and which state does not
 faizan mustafaa sahab ne mujhe bataaya ki pune ke disi badhwa bihar ke bhoomi kanoonon kaa adhyayan kar rahe the
 At the same time, he saw a large number of governments ruling through ordinance instead of law
 vadhava sahab adhyadeshon par shodh karne lage
 He came to know that between 1967 and 1981, 256 ordinances were issued in Bihar while the Legislative Assembly enacted 189 laws
 yah ek bhayaavah sthiti thi
 Not only this, on 18 January 1986, Bihar Governor Jagannath Kaushal issued 58 ordinances in one day
 yah apane aap main record ho saktaa he magar iske liye zaruri he ki aapako yah bhi pataa chale ki madhya pradesh, uttar pradesh se lekar gujarat or kerala main adhyadeshon kii kya sthiti he
 The comments baharhaal vadhava sahab ne apane shodh ke aadhaar par supreme court main mukadmaa kar diya
 After the debate, the Supreme Court made a provision in 1987 that the ordinance should not be reissued unless there is a lot of emergency
 yani ek adhyadesh jab chah maheene baad samaapt hota he to use phir se jari na kiya jaae
 Last year, when the Modi government brought the Land Acquisition Ordinance, then famous lawyer Indira Jaising also moved the Supreme Court
 abhi faisalaa aana baaki he
 By the way, if you want to read, Wadhwa Saheb has also written a book, Endangered constitutionalism- documents of supreme court case
 hamaari samvidhan sabha ne bhi adhyadesh ke beza istamaal ko lekar ashanka zaahir kii thi
 The executive does not have ordinance rights in the US and England
 bharat main adhyadesh kanoon banane kii prakriya kaa mazaaq udaane kaa zariyaa ban gaya he
 In the absence of correct information about it, this case often becomes a government of Congress vs BJP at the Center
 jabaki rajyon main adhyadesh kii vaastavik jaankaree ham sabko is gambhir samasya ke prati behatar tareeke se jaagruk kar sakati he
 Provided that these parties of ours tell whether they support the ordinance or not
 yah sahi he ki centre sarkaar ne 1952 se lekar 2014 ke bich 668 adhyadesh jari kiye hai
 But this is not the only fact
 adhyadesh loktantr ke khilaaf he
 Everyone has spoken from the first speaker to the Supreme Court
