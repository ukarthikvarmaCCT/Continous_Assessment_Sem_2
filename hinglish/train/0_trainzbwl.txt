 ahmedabad kii vishesh sibiai adaalat ne guuruuvaar ko adishnal dijipi rahe peepi pandey or gujarat ke encounter specialist kahe jane vaale purv ipies diji vanjaaraa ko ishrat jahaan muthbhed maamle main zamaanat de di
 Although PP Pandey got bail on a bond of one lakh rupees, Vanzara's bail stipulates that he will not come to Gujarat
 vanjaaraa ke vakil ne kaha ki unhen soharabuddin muthbhed maamle main bhi isi shart par zamaanat mili he ki vah mumbai nahin chodenge, so, aise main is court ne bhi use dekhte hue unhen mumbai se sirf kaamkaaji shanivaar ko hi court main hajiri dene ke liye ahmedabad aane ko kaha he
 In one way, DG Vanzara has been the face of fake encounter cases in Gujarat
 zyaadaatar maamalon main saazish karne se lekar anjaam tak laane ke un par aarope hai
 Apart from Ishrat Jahan, he is also an accused in six other encounters
 vanjaaraa ko april, 2007 main pehali baar soharabuddin muthbhed maamle main aaropee ke taur par giraftaar kiya gaya tha, or phir soharabuddin kii patni kausarabi or tulsiram prajapati kii hatya ke maamle main bhi unhen aaropee banaaya gaya
 After this, when the High Court-made SIT termed Ishrat Jahan and the other three encounters as fake, Vanzara was arrested as the main plotter in that case too
 yani april, 2007 ke baad se ek ke baad ek maamalon main vanjaaraa jail main hi rahe hai
 He has already been granted bail by the Mumbai court in the Sohrabuddin and Tulsi Prajapati cases, but now he will be released from jail after about eight years due to bail in the Ishrat Jahan case
 ishrat jahaan encounter ke vakt krime branch ke mukhiya peepi pandey the or vanjaaraa krime branch ke disipi
 While Pandey has come out of jail after getting bail, Vanzara's release may take some time, as he will have to complete the action by requesting papers from a Mumbai court

 sabase pehle to taaliyon kii gadgadaahat ke saath is faisle kaa swaagat ki cinemagharon main kisi bhi film ke pradarshan se pehle har baar raashtragan bajaayaa jayega
 During this time, the tricolor will appear on the screen and people will have to stand up
 deshbhakti or rashtraprem jaise shabdon ko har dil main basaane or logon ne rashtriya bhaavana kaa sanchaar karne kaa isse behatar vikalp or kya ho saktaa he
 But there is also an important question here
 kyadeshbhakti kaa bhavajagane or rashtraprem kaa paath sikhaane kaa sara zimmaa keval supreme court kaa he or ham nagarikon kaa koi kartavya nahin
 This is the same thing that we will do everything only when the Supreme Court tells us
 jaise, supreme court aapse kahe ki aap fasal lagaao, apane devataaon kii aradhana karo, apane mata-pita kaa sammaan karo, bharat ko akhand rakho, aam ke pedo se kahe ki aam do, nadiyon se kahe ki pani do
 This is not possible
 kuch ham nagarikon kaa bhi kartavya he
 And when it comes to patriotism, national sentiment, it becomes even more important that we not only follow the order of the court but go 10 steps ahead of it and do something that irrigates the dry drains of our hearts with the spirit of patriotism
 Give
 masalan, agar aap khaanaa kha rahe hai, to khaane se pehle raashtragan gaaie
 This will infuse the national spirit in your mind and food
 aapako lagegaa ki aap desh ke liye kha rahe hai
 Your name is the salt of the country
 ise khaane se jo urja aap arjeet karenge wo desh ke kaam aegi
 Today, be it wedding or death party, mess or club, homegrown or dining table chairs, stand cautiously before eating and sing the national anthem, then eat
 sharaab buree chiz he lekin yah desh sharaabiyon kaa bhi he
 And even though alcoholics are considered bad, they are not traitors
 sharaab ke thekon ke baahar qatari main lage logon ke liye raashtragan gaanaa anivaary kar diya janaa chahie
 If someone is unable to sing the entire national anthem or is stuttering his speech, then understand that it is no longer fit to drink alcohol
 balki aisa niyam to har paig ke pehle lagu kar dena chahie
 One who loses consciousness in enthusiasm and cannot sing the national anthem, should not be allowed to touch alcohol
 teesri ahm baat he hamaare bacchon main deshbhakti kaa jowar hona
 They should become like Abhimanyu, become the characters of an India story like Bharata
 aisa bahut zaruri he or iske liye sabase zaruri yah he ki aap sahavaas karne se pehle saavdhaan kii mudra main raashtragan gaayen
 The national anthem will fill you with patriotism before sex
 iskaa sidhaa asar aapaki santati par padegaa
 Moreover, when the tide of patriotism runs in your veins, there will be no scope for you to be impotent
 mandir main line lagaakar jab aap shivale ke baahar yaa kisi birla mandir yaa kisi bhairav dham, mata kaa darbar, thakurdwara tip jagah par hote hai to vahaan bhi tarah-tarah ke filmi dhunon par jabaran taan die gaye bhajanon ko gaakar apane antahkaran ko ganda na karen
 Stand careful and sing the national anthem
 aapke devtaa aapke desh ke hai
 You are from the country
 he na jabardast conection
 Then, when you enter the temple with the national anthem, you will find yourself crossing into the ocean of patriotism and devotion
 paanchvaan he aspataalon main raashtragan ko anivaary karnaa
 If this happens, the doctor who is treating you, immersed in the spirit of patriotism, will consider you not his victim, his brother and will give better treatment in less money
 aap bhi khud na sahi, desh ke liye jald thik hone ke liye kritasankalpit nazar aaenge
 OPD form, medicine line, x-ray machine, operation theater, trauma center, just 52 seconds careful everywhere
 phir chaahe to aap stechar par leten yaa stool par baithen
 But 52 seconds is made for the country
 chatha bahut saamaanya he
 Stop sitting and drinking cigarettes and bidis
 khadey hokar pijie
 And before lighting a cigarette, you should sing the entire national anthem
 isse do laabh honge
 One is that the tide of patriotism will motivate you to smoke less cigarettes
 jo sphurti aapako cigarette yaa bidi se milegi, usase kam nahin hogi raashtragan gane ke baad kii sphurti
 And the other benefit is that by looking at a person standing with a lighter or matchbox in hand, people will understand that you are a smoker and thus a warning will be issued for passive smoking
 saatvaan zaraa maheen he
 No person is free from doubts
 do shankaaen to sabko rose sataati hai
 Gossip and gossip lekin raashtragan gane ko lekar koi shankaa nahin rakhen
 Pressure may be faster but 52 seconds are made for the country
 laghushanka ke baad yaa dirghashanka ke baad jab aap uthte hai, tab bhi kisi filmi gane ko gaate hue haath pair dhote hi hai na
 So can't we give 52 seconds to the country? pehle gaayen or phir karen to or bhi shreshth
 Hey, the biggest benefit of this will be that a person full of national spirit will avoid polluting any public place, wall, street and the place itself will protect the people
 aathvaan bahut tazaa he
 When the youth standing in the line of the ATM is seen watching videos or playing games on their mobiles, the mother swears blood
 kya isi ke liye hamaare krantikariyon ne qurbaaniyaan di thim
 Is this why our soldiers are standing on the borders
 or yahaan to vishesh rup se khadey hone kii bhi zarurat nahin
 You are the one standing
 bas shuru ho jaaie
 Sing the national anthem
 baar-baar bhi ga sakate hai agar number aane main deree ho to
 This will bring a negativity in your mind towards black money
 or apana paisa aap deshhit main kharch karne ke liye prerit honge
 The ninth opportunity is a little private, but it should be a thought that the individual can give something to the country
 masalan, aap apane partner ke saath chumban yaa aalingan kii ichha rakhte hon, kisi mitra, rishtedaar se gale laganaa chaahate hon
 Wanting to congratulate someone on Holi or Eid, getting rewarded at the convocation ceremony or giving a speech in an election meeting, singing the national anthem before any such work will make your dedication and interest in these works sacred and true 
 10waan mauka he to sabake liye lekin uskaa maanak sthapit karne ke liye pehle loktantr ke stambhon ko aage aana hoga
 For example, in the Parliament House, the day begins with the national anthem
 har netaa, chaahe wo bhaashan dena chahta ho yaa gaali, pehle raashtragan gaae
 Every legislator Mike threw or sang a paperweight, pamphlets or notes, first the national anthem
 yahi kaam colector, espi, diaiji, ai, patawaari, tehseeldaar, sachiv vagairah bhi karen
 Before signing every file, a national anthem is produced
 or haa, media main bhi pehle panne par rose raashtragan chape
 People should keep that part with them so that it is not insulted
 tivi kii har ankar or radio kaa har udghoshak pehle raashtragan gaae, phir bulatin shuru kare
 It is just 52 seconds
 note-ye 10 tareeke suzav hai
 You can sing the national anthem when and when you want to sing it
 or haa, har raashtragan ke baad agar mithe kii bhi vyavastha ho to na to kuposhan rahegaa or na bhukhmaree
 Schemes like mid-day meal will also be eliminated

 Narendra Modi was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India for the second time on Thursday
 yah shapath grahan samaaroh kai kaarnon se janaa jayega or saath-saath ek sahyogi janata dal united dwaara mantrimandal main shaamil hone se inkaar karne ke liye bhi janaa jayega
 Just before the swearing-in ceremony, National President of Janata Dal United Nitish Kumar said that he was with the BJP but his party people did not give his consent to the proposal to accept the formal invitation to sign in the cabinet
 haalanki brihaspativaar ko bhi bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne nitish kumaar se baatcheet kii, lekin lagata he ki unke mantrimandal main ek se adhik jagah ke prastaav ko nahin mana gaya
 There are several reasons behind Nitish Kumar's non-acceptance of a cabinet post
 unamem sabase pehla kaaran unki apni party main sansadon kii naaraazgi pramukh he
 But even more, Nitish Kumar is upset with the formula in which the BJP has started following a policy of imposing decisions on allies
 bhavishya main khaas taur par bihar vidhansabha chunaav main agar yahi formula doharaaya gaya to unako lene ke dene pad sakate hai
 Therefore, making public the decision not to join the cabinet, Nitish Kumar gave a clear indication to the BJP that there was no compulsion on him to accept the bjp's decision
 unase yah apeksha nahin rakhi jaae ki bhaajapa jaisaa chaahegi ve vaisaa karenge, bhale loksabhaa chunaav main use prachand bahumat mila ho
 Nitish was upset about the fact that the Akali Dal, which has two parliaments, he and Paswan, who have six parliaments, were also made one cabinet minister each, while his party JDU has 16 parliaments and the same space for it
 Placed in the cabinet
 haalanki iskaa koi tatkaal raajnneetik prabhaav dekhne ko nahin milegaa lekin bhaajapa ab nitish ke har qadam ko zarur naaptul kar dekhegi
 People in the BJP say that nothing will happen as soon as a section of the media starts the game of creating new political equations and spoiling it because Nitish Kumar is comforted in running the government with the BJP, the twenty months government with RJD i have never seen isliye is puure prakaran kaa ek hi sandesh he ki nitish sarkaar main bhagidaar banenge lekin apni sharton par
 And the Bihar coalition also has the same boss, so by taking a decision, the BJP cannot hope that they will agree

 maine garibi-pichhadepan ko bhugta he
 He said that the great men have put a reputation for fame and benami property in the name of power, so they are giving me these lewd abuses
 unhone kaha ki agar mahamilawat karne waalon main dam he to vah dikhaae ki kya kabhi modi ne benami sampatti banaai he kya?pradhanmantri ne kaha ki aaj pakistan puure din daraa hua rahata he

 main isaki screening ke liye haul main pahunchaa
 When he looked at himself on screen, he asked a question
 agar aage bhi mujhe kaam miltaa rahaa to kya main aise hi acting karuunga
 The answer was no
 mujhe mahasoos hua ki acting karnaa itnaa aasaan kaam nahin he
 If i want to continue this career, i have to devise my own way
 tab aglaa sawaal saamne aayaa, kaise
 2
 madhubala se pyaarakya mujhe madhubala se pyaar tha, jaisaa ki us vakt ke akhbaar or magazine baar baar report karte the
 Yes, i was attracted to him
 nihsandeh vah bahut acchhee actress thim
 As a woman, she also had many such qualities, which were close to my desire at that time
 ajeeb sa chaav tha unki shakhsiyat main
 Because of them i came out of my shyness
 dilip kumaar kii autobiography launch kii tasviren3
 When we separated from Madhubala: We were playing immortal love on screen for the film mughal-e-azam, then our relationship ended in real life
 film aadhi hi ban pai thi or haalat ye thi ki ham aapas main baat tak nahin karte the
 a love scene from mughal-e-azam is counted among the greatest love scenes of all time
 jab saleem kii god main anaarakali sir rakh leti he
 Maestro Tansen is having a conversation in the background
 or saleem abhisar ke liye anaarakali ke chehre par ek pankh ghuma rahaa he
 But in real life, at that time, we did not even leave the ritual prayer salute

 Why rejects Mother India: i had been the hero of Nargis in two films before Mother India
 aise main unke bete ke role kaa prastaav jamaa nahin
 i was overwhelmed when Mehboob Khan told me the script of this film
 mujhe laga ki yah film har keemat par banaai jaani chahie
 Then he offered me the role of a son of Nargis
 maine unhen samajhaayaa ki mela aurababul main unke saath romance karne ke baad yah makul nahin hoga

 At that time I, Pran, Johnny Walker, Director Bimal Roy and his assistant Hrishikesh Mukherjee were present there
 kisi bhi din pakup ke baad asal majaa shuru hota tha
 When i and Pran spoke in Punjabi, Bimal and Rishi would start talking in Bengali
 bich main kisson or shaayari kaa bhi daur chalata
 On the other hand, the chef was busy making a great dish for us

 Until much later i used to go for a shot on the set with mental preparation
 main saadhaaran se seen ko bhi kai tech main or lagaataar reharsal ke baad karne ke liye kukhyat tha
 7
 bahan ne danta mere hajjam kohmere hajjam ko mere baalo se hameshaa dikkat hoti thi
 He used to think that these combats grow very fast
 har 15 din main katwane kii naubat aa jaati thi
 He keeps grooming them again and again, but he does not stay in his place
 ek baar kaa kissa yaad aa rahaa he
 Hairdresser came home to cut hair
 main kahin shooting main mashruf tha
 i kept telling him to wait if i don't meet him at home
 jab main waapas aayaa to dekha alag hi najaara
 That sir sat in my drawingroom

 i immediately apologized to my hairdresser for this
 baad main meri sakina aapa se is baat ko lekar jhadap bhi hui

 That is why i avoided doing movies with him
 magar yahaan to ek behad khubasurat aurat khadi thi
 She actually looked more beautiful than i thought

 When i learned to play sitar: i had a movie in 1960 called Kohinoor

 In an editorial in the party's mouthpiece 'saamana', the Shiv Sena today asked the state's Culture Minister Vinod Tawde to remain firm on its earlier announcement of showing Marathi films in multiplexes between six and nine evenings
 ‘prime time bheekh nahin’ sheershak se likhe is sampadakeey lekh main kaha gaya he, ‘‘prime time bheekh nahin balki marathi cinema kaa haq he
 The Shiv Sena said that the government's recent move to show Marathi cinema in multiplexes anytime between 12 pm and 9 pm shows that the government has succumbed to cinema owners
 isamen kaha gaya he ki marathi filmein box offis par bhi acha kar rahi hai or behatar vishaywastu dikhaa rahi hai
 They are being counted down by giving them incorrect time slots and this is due to the theatrical owners racket and some unscrupulous producers
 isamen kaha gaya he ki marathi cinema auskar tak ja chukaa he or iskaa darshak varg bahut bada he
 Recalling Maharashtra's contribution to Indian cinema, it reads, "V
 shantaram or si
 Shining Marathi stars like Ramchandra (music directors) have made their invaluable contribution to Hindi cinema
 ’’ agar maharashtra main marathi cinema prime time main nahin dikhaai ja rahi to is maamle par sarkaar mook darshak nahin rah sakati

 Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the opposition has started devising a strategy to surround the Modi government
 vipaksh bijepi ko gherne ke liye mahagathbandhan ko majboot banane main juta he, isi koshish main andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu ab anya raajnneetik dalon ko saath laane kii ek nai pahal karne ja rahe hai
 Naidu is trying to convince big leaders of the opposition to jointly file a petition against income tax or ED red
 unka maananaa he ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se centre sarkaar in agenciyon kaa istemaal vipaksh ke khilaaf kar saktihai, isliye isapar roak lagaana jaruri he
 He can also raise this issue with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee
 aapako bataa den ki haal hi main andhrapradesh or pashchim bengal kii rajya sarkaron ne apane rajya main sibiai ke aane par roak lagane kii baat kahi thi
 Let us tell you that the upcoming November 22, Kochindrababu Naidu has called a big meeting of the leaders of the opposition
 is baithak main ve modi sarkaar ke khilaaf ranneeti bana sakate hai, saath healoksabhaa chunaav main kis tarah bijepi ko roak jaae is baat par bhi manthan ho saktaa he
 Significantly, after a long dispute, Chandrababu Naidu said goodbye to the NDA, since which there have been attackers against the BJP
 haal hi main unhone congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi se bhi mulaakaat kii thi, jiske baad donon netaaon ne elaan kiya tha ki vah bijepi ke khilaaf milakar chunaav ladenge
 a commentator says that "in 1993, the US government had reached the brink of declaring Pakistan a country that supports terrorism
" '' tabhi se us khatre kaa or uske nae rup 'aatankwaadi desh' ke thappe kaa khatra hameshaa se uske sir par jhulata rahaa he
 During this period Pakistan has been directly involved in such number of terrorist activities in which Americans died
 saath hi europea, afgani or kai bharatiyon kii bhi jaan gai
 Despite this, Pakistan remains a 'major non-nato ally' in the US terminology and has been generously supported for military assistance and development
 haalanki america congress main lagaataar kai koshishon ke baad madad ke taur par mil rahe is dhan ke pravaah (2002 ke baad se pakistan ko 33 arab dollar kii raashi mili he) par thodi roak lagi he
 By 2016, this help was modest (a little over $ 1 billion) as the US Department of Defense refused to certify that Pakistan had taken adequate steps to block the Haqqani network
 america congress main yah prastaav bhi vichaarneey he ki pakistan par pabandi laga di jaae or use aatankwaadi desh ghoshit kar diya jaae
 Significantly, President Donald Trump and several senior members of his administration have become quite vocal in their criticisms and warnings to Islamabad about Pakistan's two-pronged policy of helping 'agents of destruction'
 mahatvapurn yah bhi he ki sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ke dauraan washington or nai dilli kii dharanaon main talmail dikhaa
 While Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj addressed Pakistan as a jihadist university and terrestrian, Trump threatened to 'expose and hold countries responsible for terrorist organizations such as al-qaeda who have slaughtered the innocent'
 haalanki kai aise kaarak hai jo philhal pakistan ko aatankwaadi desh ghoshit karne se rokte hai
 Most important is the US interest to maintain supplies through common forces to Pakistan in Afghanistan (although this dependency is also decreasing now)
 iske alaava yah dar bhi he ki aisi kisi ghoshnaa ke baad parmaanu shaktisampann yah desh yaa to bekaabu ho saktaa he yaa phir vahaan ke satta sansthaanon kii haalat itani kamjor ho sakati he ki jansanhaar ke hathiyaar islamic aatankwaadi guton ke haath lag jaaen
 However, in the direction of us-pakistan relations right now, there is ample evidence that the restrictions of the restrictions are gradually being tightened and their culmination is inevitable, provided Islamabad does not completely reverse its policies
 
 jaankaar bataate he ki aise kisi bhi pratibandh kaa bahut kam asar hoga kyonki america par uski vittiya or sainya nirbharta pehle hi aitihaasik rup se nunatam str par he (vah apane 70 fisadi hathiyaar ab china se hasil kar rahaa he)
 However, this too is a foolish thing
 washington se niyantrit kai saare antarrashtriya sansthaanon se milane vaali madad par pakistan lagbhag puri tarah nirbhar he
 There is a huge foreign debt on him

 itane popular hue kii google play store or ap store muft downlod kiye jane vaale eps kii katigari main kuch samay ke liye fasebuk or whatsap se bhi upar aa gaye
 a few days after 5 September, they became top apps
 isaki vajah ye thi kii shuruyaat main jeeyo actevet karne ke liye yugers ko reliance jeeyo ke 12 eps install karne jaruri the
 Failure to do so would result in difficulty in activation and calling
 haalanki ab aisa nahin he or bina ap install kiye bhi acteveshan procesar ho rahaa he
 And perhaps this is the reason why now the popularity of apps is also steadily decreasing
 ap store par bhi ab maai jeeyo ap kii lokapriyata kam ho rahi he or ab yah ap sabase zyada downlod kiye jane vaale ap main tisare number par aa gaya he

 It is worth noting that currently subscriptions are free for all Jio apps
 yani services free hone ke baad bhi isse logon kii dilchaspee kam ho rahi he
 After the free subscription ends, these apps will have to be paid for using
 to kya aise main ye eps reliance jeeyo ke liye kitne safal honge ye to nahin kaha ja saktaa
 According to the users, in the current era, Jio's apps stop and hang up too much

 Villagers are getting worried about banking system in Naxal-affected areas of Chhattisgarh
 darasal zyaadaatar bank gramin anchalon main naa to apni shakha kholane main ruchi dikhaa rahe hai or naa ATM
 He fears that the Naxalites will leave no stone unturned to clean their hands
 is khatre ke chalate unhone naksal prabhavit ilaakon main banking kaarobaar ko lekar koi ruchi nahin dikhaai he
 As a result a large population of Chhattisgarh is deprived of banking facilities
 jo bhi bank apni sevaayen de rahe hai, wo shahari mukhyalayon yaa phir jila mukhyalay par sthapit he
 Banking business has not yet started in rural areas, especially in forest-populated villages
 haalanki rajanandgaanv jile or bastar sambhag main banking shakha or ATM kholane ke liye 150 sthalon kaa chinhankan kiya gaya tha
 But at only 22 places, various banks have agreed to open their branches
 88 sthanon khaskar aabaadi vaale gaanv main naksali khatre ke maddesner kisi bhi bank ne apni branch kholane main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai

 But most of the banks refused to open branches even if it is a distance
 darasal zyaadaatar afasar is baat se dare hue the ki un ilaakon main jaan- maal ke khatre ke alaava bainkon ke lutane ke asaar zyada hai
 The state government assured most banks of allotment and security for opening of branches
 phir bhi bank un ilaakon main apni suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaane ko lekar taiyaar nahin hai
 Proposal for setting up of 33 banking branches was proposed to the Bankers' Committee for the establishment of 33 banking branches in Bijapur
 lekinmaatr chaar sthanonmen hi bank shakha kholane par sahmati bani
 Banking facilities will be available at only 5 out of 18 in Dantewada, 6 out of 7 urban areas in Kanker, only 4 out of 7 in Kondagaon and only 3 out of 12 in Narayanpur
 jabaki sukama main prastaavit 25 sthanon main se maatr paanch ilaakon main hi bank khulenge
 The same situation is with Rajnandgaon
 yahaan 19 main se 15 sthalon par banking suvidhaayen jutaney kaa faisla liya gaya

 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare apane 18 saansadon ke saath aaj (ravivaar) ramalala ke darbar pahunche or ramalala mandir main prarthana kii
 His move is being seen as putting political pressure on the Modi government to build the Ram temple
 ayodhya main uddhav thakare ne press conference kar kaha ki centre main majboot sarkaar he
 If the Modi government takes steps to build a temple, we will be together
 uddhav ne kaha, centre sarkaar ram mandir nirmaan kaa faisla kare or jaldi ram mandir bane
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that the temple should be built by bringing ordinance
 unhone kaha ki agar jarurat padi to ham phir mandir andolan shuru karenge
 Uddhav said, when last time came, people thought that i had come to politics but i had given the slogan 'first temple then government'
 
 i said that i will come again after the election and i kept my promise
 aaj kah rahaa hum ki ki mandir banegaa hi banegaa

 com / xxyo7u42zr — ANI UP (@aninewsup) June 16, 2019 It is noteworthy that even before the Lok Sabha elections, Uddhav Thackeray visited Ayodhya with his family and raised the Modi government in the dock for the construction of Ram temple
 ab loksabhaa chunaav ke baad sadhu-santon ke jayakaare ke bich uddhav thakare apane 18 saansadon ke saath ayodhya pahunche
 When Uddhav Thackeray reached Ayodhya for the first time before the Lok Sabha elections, he had said that Ram is not a matter of politics for us
 shivasena ram ke naam par kabhi vot nahin maangegi
 We will come to Ayodhya again after the Lok Sabha elections
 vaise dekha jaae, to uddhav thakare kii siyaasi viraasat hi ayodhya se judi he
 However, it is different that the idea of handling it with the visit of Ayodhya came after three decades
 vahiin, modi sarkaar or yogi sarkaar par sadhu-sant lagaataar dabaav bana rahe hai
 They say that the Modi government has once again come to power by promising to build the Ram temple
 ab centre main modi sarkaar or uttar pradesh main yogi sarkaar he, to ram mandir nirmaan main deree kis baat kii? sadhu-sant loksabhaa chunaav se pehle modi sarkaar se ram mandir banane ke liye adhyadesh tak laane kii maang kar chuke hai
 Along with the Sant Samaj, political allies like Shiv Sena are also looking towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah with hope
 aise main ab mandir nirmaan ke liye isse behatar siyaasi halaat or kya honge? vaise bhi ram mandir mudde ke sahare hi bijepi ne apana alag siyaasi vajood banaaya he
 At present, the matter of construction of Ram temple is in the Supreme Court and Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself has said that the government will take any action on this issue only after the decision of the court
 kya he puraa maamla?ram mandir maamle ko saal 1950 main gopal singh vishaarad ne elahabaad hoicourt main daakhil kiya tha
 Through this, he sought permission to worship at the disputed site in Hindu customs
 iske baad saal 1959 main nirmohi akhaada ne vivaadit bhoomi par apane niyantran kii maang kii
 Like the Nirmohi Arena, the Muslim Central Waqf Board also rejected its claim on disputed land in the court
 iske baad saal 2010 main elahabaad hoicourt ne vivaadit jameen ko teen hisson main baant diya or ramalala virajman, nirmohi akhaada va sunni vakf board ke bich ko saunp bhi diya
 Now the Supreme Court has formed a three-member panel for consensus on this title suit, which has to submit its report in sealed envelope by August 15 under the new deadline
 yah panel is baat kii tasdik karegaa ki kya vivaad se jude pakshon ke bich aam sahmati ban sakati he
 If yes, what will be its formula? This three-member panel consists of former Supreme Court Justice Fakir Mohammad Ibrahim Kalifulla, spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and senior advocate Sriram Panchu
 is panel kii report ke saamne aane ke baad hi pataa chal paaegaa ki ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan kaa rasta aakhir kaise banegaa? Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) has vacancy

 After several days of unease, the congress-ncp finally agreed to support the Shiv Sena and after several rounds of meetings till Friday evening, Sharad Pawar announced that the new CM of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray would be there and on Saturday the three parties met the Governor Will stake claim to form government

 Congress President Sonia Gandhi has given the go-ahead to the system of organizing organizational elections in the youth wing of the party despite the reluctance of many senior leaders of the party
 sutron ke mutabik sonia se manjuuri milane ke baad bhartiya yuva congress ke bheetar sanghathanaatmak chunaav kii shuruyaat punjab praant se ho rahi he jahaan isi maheene chunaav sampann karaayaa jayega
 Recently, there were reports that after the objection of many senior party leaders, especially some PCC presidents, the system of internal elections in the Youth Congress and other such organizations can be stopped at present
 congress se jude vishwasth sutron ne bataaya ki gat shuukravaar ko sonia gandhi ne yuva congress ke prabharee krishna allaavaru or adhyaksh shrinivas bivi ke saath mulaakaat main yah spasht kiya ki sanghathanaatmak chunaav kii vyavastha jari rahegi
 With the green signal from Sonia, the Youth Congress has started the process of election of the organization in Punjab
 sanghathan kii ore se tay asthaayee chunavi kaarykram ke mutabik rajya main 24 se 27 november ke bich matdaan hoga or 28 november ko nateezon kii ghoshnaa kar di jaaegi

 punjab main chunaav puraa hone ke baad un rajyon main chunaav karaae jaaenge jahaan pichley paanch-saat saal se chunaav nahin hue hai
 For example, the organization has not been elected in Kerala for seven years
 aise main sambhav he ki punjab ke baad kerala main chunaav hon
 In fact, Rahul Gandhi, as the Congress General Secretary in charge of frontal organizations, started the system of organizational elections so that qualified grassroots youth can get a chance to advance in the Congress Party
 chunaav kii jimmedaari rahul ke karibiyon main shumaar sachin raav ko di gai thi
 While Rahul was the general secretary, the system of organizational elections in the Youth Congress continued even while he was president, although in many states elections could not be held on time
 sutron kaa kahana he ki rahul gandhi ke adhyaksh pad se istipha dene ke baad congress ke kai varisht netaaon khaskar kuch pisisi adhyakshon kii ore se yah kaha gaya ki yuva congress main sanghathanaatmak chunaav main bahut sthanon par rasukhdaar pariwaron se taalluk rakhane or dhanabal kaa upyog karne vaale ummidavaaron ke jeetne kii jaankaree saamne ai he or aise main philhal chunaav par roak lagani chahie
 Controversies also arose in the Youth Congress elections many times in the past
 himachal pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri virbhadra singh ke putr vikramaditya singh 2011 main himachal yuva congress ke adhyaksh pad kaa chunaav jite the
 His election was later canceled if there was a case of violation of the code of conduct
 chunaav kii pairokari kar rahe yuva congress ke varisht padaadhikariyon kii raay he ki chunaav se sanghathan main jamini kaaryakartaaon ko aage badhane kaa mauka miltaa he or aise main rahul gandhi dwaara banaai gai vyavastha chalati rahani chahie
 The youth Congress directly elects senior officials at the block, district and state levels
 inamen yuva congress ke pradesh adhyakshon kaa chunaav bhi shaamil hai
 The election of the National President of the Youth Congress has been done with the opinion of the national officials and with the consent of Team Rahul

 ucchtam nyaayalay ne tamilnadu kii purv mukhyamantri je jayalalita kii akut sampatti ekatra karne ko lekar darj maamle ko khaarij karne sambandhi yachika ko thukraa diya
 a hearing in this case is scheduled to begin in Karnataka
 nyaayadhish bi sudarshan reddy tathaa es es nijjar kii peeth ne annadramuk pramukh jayalalita kii apil ko khaarij kar diya
 It was said in the appeal that the Karnataka High Court had erroneously followed the order of the lower court stating that there was no irregularity or illegal action in taking cognizance of the complaint filed on June 5, 1997
 sheersh adaalat ne 19 march ko 14 saal puraane maamle kii sunwaayee par sthaganadesh dene se inkaar kar diya tha or saath hi nichali adaalat ko nirdesh diya tha ki jayalalita ko puraa samay dene ke baad vah maamle ke 42 gavaahon se jirah ke liye samay seemaa tay kare
 AIADMK chief Jayalalithaa had moved the apex court challenging the Karnataka High Court's decision on March 10
 varsh 2003 main sheersh adaalat ne maamle ko ucch nyaayalay ko sthanantarit kar diya tha
 The move was taken on a petition by DMK leader Anabazhagan and Jayalalithaa was the chief minister at that time
 dramuk netaa ne yachika main kaha tha ki jis tareeke se chennai kii sunwaayee adaalat ne maamle ko liya he, vah maamle kii nishpaksh or swatantra sunwaayee par andeh paidaa karata he
 On the March 10 order of the High Court, Jayalalithaa had said in her petition that no case had been made against her in the charge sheet
 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki chennai adaalat ke vishesh nyaayadhish ne apana dimag nahin lagaaya or masini tareeke se paanch june 1997 ko daayar kiye gaye aaropapatr kaa sangyaan le liya
 It also alleged that the case was transferred at the behest of his political rivals in Tamil Nadu
 annadramuk pramukh par varsh 1991 se 1996 ke bich tamilnadu kii mukhyamantri pad par rahete hue 66
 It is alleged to have acquired assets worth Rs 65 crores
 unki yachika main kaha gaya tha ki ucch nyaayalay ne unke dwaara uthaae gaye kuch muddon kaa samaadhaan nahin kiya or isliye aadesh kanoon sammat nahin he
 The High Court dismissed Jayalalithaa's plea to quash the Chennai lower court's order issued in 1997
 nichali adaalat ne tamilnadu satarkta evam bhrashtachar nirodhi nideshaalay kii us shikaayat kaa sangyaan liya tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki jayalalita ne is avadhi main apane gyaat sroton se adhik sampatti arjeet kii
 The High Court had said in its order that "eminent lawyers presented Jayalalithaa's case with efficiency" and she attended the hearing of the case during which over 200 witnesses were examined over 13 years
 adaalat ne apane aadesh main kaha tha,‘‘ ab jayalalita ke paas yah vikalp nahin he ki vah is aadhaar par kaarywahi ko radd karne kii maang karen ki aparaadh kaa sangyaan lete hue paanch june 1997 ko jari aadesh kanoon sammat nahin he
 '' bijepi saansad shyama charan gupta kaa kahana he ki dephence main agar dallali kaa aarope lag rahaa he, to ye gambhir masalaa he
 It should be investigated
 unhone kaha ki agar is maamle main pehle se koi sarkari jaanch chal rahi he, to ise pramukhataa se puraa karnaa chahie
 Shyama Charan Gupta said that the defense case is related to the security of the country
 isliye isaki jaanch honi chahie
 If anyone has disturbed it, then whoever it is, the strongest action should be taken against it
 piem modi ke bare main shyama charan gupta ne kaha ki modi desh ke abhi tak ke sabase eemaandaar or kaam karne vaale pradhanmantri hai
 They always take tough decisions in the interest of the country
 kanpur ke aitihaasik phulbaag maidan se ab bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke pratyaashee or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra lalkaar modi paaenge
 In view of the lukewarm attitude of the Kanpur administration, the BJP has sought permission for another ground for the rally
 26 sitambar 2013 ko kanpur bijepi cameti ne kanpur prashasan ko ek patr likhaa tha
 It demanded the historic Phul Bagh Maidan for Narendra Modi's rally
 kanpur prashasan ne maukhik taur par to phulbaag maidan main raily karne kii anumati bijepi ko de di thi, magar likhit main anumati 4 aktubar tak nahin di gai
 bjp's concern was growing in view of the lukewarm attitude of the Kanpur administration
 aise main, narendra modi ke khaas amit shah ne kanpur ke nagar adhyaksh surendra maithani se maidan badalane or uskaa puraa byoraa maanga
 City President Surendra Maithani suggested the name of the ground in front of Buddha Park in Kanpur Indra Nagar area for Narendra Modi's rally
 surendra maithani kii maane to phulbaag maidan kii kshamta mahaj ek se ek lakh bees hajaar logon kii he, jabaki modi kii raily main 4 lakh se zyada bheed jutane kii ummid he
 In such a situation, this ground has now been canceled for the rally
 kanpur ke indra nagar ilaake main maujuud buddha park ke saamne bane maidan ko raily ke liye chunaa gaya he
 BJP has given the permission letter to Kanpur DM Sameer Verma to get Narendra Modi's rally organized in this ground
 phulbaag maidan se judaa he itihasphoolbaag maidan ko kanpur kii dhadkan bhi kaha jaataa he
 The entire history of Kanpur is captured in Phulbagh Maidan, north of the city
 is maidan se raajnneetik safar kii shuruyaat karne vaale kai safal rajaneta bhi rahe hai
 Indira Gandhi has also given speeches from this ground
 bijepi ke laal krishna adwani kaa priy bhi phulbaag maidan he
 It is said that the road was blocked when Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji of the BJP filled the ground with this
 tay hua tha yahaan nahin hogi koi raajnneetik reliraili kii vajah se shahar main lagane vaale jam ko dekhte hue phulbaag maidan main kisi bhi tarah ke raily ke aayojan ko bain kar diya gaya tha
 Its support was also unanimously accepted by all party leaders
 magar achaanak bijepi ke jidd kii vajah se kanpur prashasan uljhan kii sthiti main aa gaya tha
 On October 2, the DM of Kanpur, in a meeting with BJP leaders, made it clear that if the BJP is given grounds for the rally then every party will have to give it
 phir bhi kanpur prashasan ne maidan kii dekharekh karne vaale nagar nigam or suraksha ko dekhte hue kanpur esaspi se byoraa maanga tha
 Now the question arises that when the administration knew the potential of this ground and also knew about the gathering of Modi's rally, then why keep the ground hanging with permission
 jab phulbaag maidan main kisi bhi raily ke aayojan par roak he to bijepi ko sidhe taur par kanpur prashasan ne manaa kyon nahin kiya

 When Lok Sabha leader Sushma Swaraj accused Kapil Sibal of saving Tarun Tejpal in gestures, the Law Minister came out in front of the media and clarified
