 He has unmatched ability to deal with difficult situations very easily

 pichley saal agast main antarrashtriya cricket se sanyas lene vaale lakshmana ne haalanki dhoni or purv captain saurav ganguli ke bich kisi tarah kii tulana se inkaar kar diya
 Ravindra Jadeja's emergence as an all-rounder and Shikhar Dhawan's superb batting at the top order have been two positives for Indian cricket recently and Laxman said Dhoni should be credited for finding talent like Jadeja
 unhone kaha, dhoni ne uskaa puraa samarthan kiya visheshkar gendbaaj ke rup main jadeja kaa istemaal acha rahaa
 He is also an excellent fielder and a good batsman
 jadeja bhartiya cricket main ahm khilaadi ke rup main ubhara he or dhoni kii tarif kii jaani chahie
 Regarding Dhawan, Laxman said, "I played his mentor while being associated with (IPL franchise) Sunrisers Hyderabad
" usamen hameshaa se pratibha rahi he or usne apane rukh main jo badlaav kiya he uskaa use phayda mila he
 Laxman said that defending champions and world number one ODI team India are going in the right direction for the 2015 World Cup
 tippaniyan "the way we beat England in England (last month during the Champions Trophy) was fantastic
" is pradarshan ke liye yuvaaon ko bhi shrey diya janaa chahie

 Laxman also hoped that Sachin Tendulkar would be able to do well in the South Africa Round later this year
 dakshin africa ke pichley daure (2010-11) par tendulkar ne centurian or capatoun main do shatak jade the
 Recalling the tour, Laxman said, "I am sure he will go there with good memories of his two centuries
" varsh 2011 main padam shri puraskaar se sammanit hyderabad ke is kalatmak ballebaaj ne kaha, mujhe bharosa he ki is baar bhi uske liye shrunkhlaa shandaar rahegi
 While wishing India for the tour of South Africa, Laxman said, India will go there with the confidence of defeating Australia 4-0

 He is not emotionally attached to it and that is his specialty
 bharat bhaagyashaalee he ki uske paas dhoni jaisaa captain he

 olerounder ke rup main ravindra jadeja kaa ubharna or sheersh kram main shikhar dhawan kii shandaar ballebaaji bhartiya cricket ke liye haal main do sakaaratmak chijen raheen or lakshmana ne kaha ki jadeja jaisi pratibha khojane kaa shrey dhoni ko diya janaa chahie
 He said, Dhoni fully supported him especially Jadeja was good use as a bowler
 vah behtareen kshetrarakshak or acha ballebaaj bhi he
 Jadeja has emerged as an important player in Indian cricket and Dhoni should be praised
 dhawan ke bare main lakshmana ne kaha, (ipel frenchiji) sunrisers hyderabad ke saath jude hone ke dauraan maine uske menter kii bhoomika nibhaai
 He has always had talent and he has benefited from the change in his attitude

 Key-board knocking, making hasty mistakes of breaking a news first, always opening Google and searching the scribble to write the story quickly, agree or disagree and keep doing your work
 ek news room main yahi sab to chalata he lekin news room kii tasviir varshon tak ek hi company main kaam karne ke baad gaharaai se samaj aane lagati he
 The company in which it was felt on the first day that hey, here the girls are given a lot of opportunities to move forward
 usee company main kai saal bitaane ke baad aisa lagane laga ki yahaan bhi socity kaa vahi niyam he jiske mutabik ladakiyon par zyada bharosa karnaa bevakoofi kaa kaam mana jaataa he
 Boys always have to struggle for the opportunities to get ahead in the office
 maine jab naukari shuru kii to dekha ladkiyaan offis main badi sankhya main jarur thim magar wo sabhi routine ke kaamon ke liye thim
 The men held large positions
 shift incharge ke pad par maine kabhi kisi mahila ko nahin dekha
 Initially i felt that only the good men may have met and they were recruited for this but later it seemed that the matter was something else
 jawaab khojane kii kaaphi koshish karti rahi lekin jawaab nahin mila
 Today i feel that this is not the answer, i am looking for a woman working in any government or private office
 iske peeche kii badi vajah yahi he ki aaj bhi badi se badi uplabdhiyaan mahilaon ke naam par hone ke baad bhi unhen mahilaon kii kaabiliyat par vishwaas nahin ho paaya he
 The second thing is also that we women also do not have the habit of looking at women in any major position
 yah bhi maine offis main rahakar hi mahasoos kiya he
 If a man holding a senior position spoke to do something, then the anxiety to complete it on time is not in us as much as the restlessness in our senior female colleague's work

 neshnal assembly main bayaan dete hue gilaani ne kaha ki bharat kii ore se aadhikarik rup se die gaye dastavej ko main sirf jaankaree kahuunga, kyonki vah saboot nahin he

 Democracy is a well organized and fiercely competitive business, in which all the buying and selling is the basic thing of this business in the bargaining of the voters' emotions, ambitions and resentment

 And no party has such a record
 do raay nahin ki congress ne aazaadee ke baad un khoe hue maukon kii bharpai se bhi zyada batora-sameta
 The axis of our fresh confusion rests exactly there

 There is nothing surprising in this either

 Wherever there was a slight reluctance to spend a number of money, black money immediately seized it and took its place
 ab to yah chunaav yani loktantr kii lekhajokha pranali ke saath ek paryaay ke rup main jud gaya he
 That is, the opposite of corruption in politics is not sincerity but hypocrisy

 The government argued that on speaking of Hooda, it sounded like the surname of former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda
 huda naam se hota tha bhramahuda (HUDA) ko ab HSVP ke taur par janaa jayega
 Haryana Cabinet Minister Anil Vij said, 'there was confusion with Huda's name as it was very similar to Hooda's name

 He said that the decision to change the name of HUDA was taken in the cabinet meeting chaired by the Chief Minister

 Kuldeep Sharma said that the government is creating stories to save its failures

 Researchers believe that an element found in red wine can help in the treatment of depression and anxiety
 paudhon se praapt yah tatv yaa plant compound resaveratrol ek khaas anzime ke srav ko rokkar tanaav-rodhi prabhaav darshaati he, jisase chintaa niyantran main rahati he

 Researchers have discovered that resveratrol has anti-depressant properties, but what this element has to do with Fostodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is yet to be ascertained
 phostodiesterej 4 ek anzim he jo tanaav hormone corticosterone se prabhavit hota he
 Corticosterone regulates physiological response to stress
 bahut adhik chintaa se dimag main is hormone kii maatra main vruddhi hoti he or aakhirkaar isse tanaav or anya maansik vikaron kaa janm hota he

 Chinese smartphone maker Huawei has launched two flagship smartphones - P30 and P30 Pro
 inamen se Huawei P30 Pro zyada khaas he, kyonki isamen chaar camere die gaye hai, ek camera he jise company periscope camera kahati he jisamen 5X optical juum diya gaya he or isamen 125mm kaa lens laga he
 There will be talk about the camera, but before that we tell the quick review of this smartphone
 yah quick rivyuu lagbhag ghante bhar smartphone yuses par aadhaarit he
 --- It is high end smartphone and has 6
 47 inch kii OLED disple di gai he or isamen water drop noch bhi he
 Kevin Hu of Huawei, who oversees product management, has told us that the P30 Pro may have a single selfie camera, but it has been significantly improved compared to the P20 Pro
 --- is smartphone ke teen storage verients hai – 128GB, 256GB or 512GB
 RAM 8GB and we have used 256GB variants
 --- is smartphone main Kirin 989 prosesar diya gaya he
 xxrep 4 - Glass metal design in the smartphone and it is available in five color variants - We have tried the crystal variant which has blue shade
 phone se lite riflact karata he or alag alag angal se alag dikhataa he
 --- P30 Pro does not have a headphone jack, but its design is water and dust proof and its rating is IP68
 --- is phone kii sabase badi khaasiyat isamen die gaye camere hai
 The primary camera is 40 megapixels and its aperture f1
 6 he
 The wide angle lens is 20 megapixels, while the periscope camera is 8 megapixels
 ek camera time of flite he jo lite kii speed major karata he or data lekar tasviir ko behatar banaata he
 The company says that the 40-megapixel sensor captures 40 percent more light because it uses the RYYG array
 --- is phone main 4,200mah kii bydaree he or iske saath 40W kaa fast charger diya jayega
 Shiny with myriad colors Last year, the company introduced a new design with the P20 Pro
 ye dizin shaini glass kaa tha or gradient finnish tha
 This finish also reflects light
 P30 Pro main dizin vaisaa hi he phone zyada shaini he yah kaaphi pramium dikhataa he
 Like the oneplus 6T or Pixel 3 XL, it is very compact and has a big screen which is 6
 47 inch kii he
 This phone fits perfectly in the hand
 rier panel par lage glass kii vajah se hold karne main aasaani hoti he or metal frem bhi he
 The phone feels good because of gradient finish and light effects
 didine ke maamle main P30 Pro kamaal kaa phone he lekin phir bhi agar kisi cheez ko point out karnaa hoga to main iske dizin ko change karnaa chaahunga, kyonki ye thodaa purana ho rahaa he
 We saw this kind of design with Galax s phones a few years ago, but the company did a lot of improvisation with the P20 Pro
 P30 Pro bhi aisa hi he, lekin 2019 main ise thodaa fresh hona chahie tha
 It cannot be called old, but it is not even a phone that can be called ground breaking in terms of design
 haalanki, ek tarah se main is baat kaa shukraguzaar hum ki ki isamen water drop noch he or kuch ground braking nahin he
 Recent Samsung smartphones have given punch hole displays with front cameras
 iske alaava aise phone bhi hai jinamein pop ap camere die gaye hai
 Huawei rests on the old water drop notch and i think this is by far the best way to use the front camera
 haalanki disple settings main noch ko hide bhi kar sakate hai
 Overall we liked the design
 Huawei P30 Pro camera – kya ye sach main achche hai?hamane kuch samay ke liye hi ise tri kiya he, isliye ham isaki bydaree life ke bare main baat nahin kar sakate hai or kai fitures hai jiske bare main bhi baat nahin kar sakate hai
 But there are some things in which the Kirin 980 processor is very fast and it is of Snapdragon 855 level
 phone fast he kuch samay tak browj kiya, kuch eps tri kiye, kuch contant yuj kiye hai or multi tasking bhi tri kiya he
 The user interface is fast and no lag appears anywhere
 meraa positive impressant isliye bhi he, kyonki isaki screen jise maine kaaphi behatar paaya he
 It is not quite as bright as it is in Super Amoled and is used by Samsung
 lekin nishchit taur par ye duusare flagship smartfones se alag he
 Its screen is bright and it can be easily used in sunlight
 camera kii baat karte hai, limited expirience ke aadhaar par hamen yakeen he ki P30 Pro kaa camera kamaal kaa he, lekin mujhe aisa bhi lagata he ki company ko software or clin karnaa chahie
 We have clicked some pictures from this smartphone and the kind of flagability that comes from wide angle is better
 P30 pro se clic kii gai tasveeron main kaaphi diteling he chaahe aap acchhee raushnee main clic karen yaa kharaab raushnee main
 Image colors are also good and the HDR given in P30 Pro is also better
 camera ap main kuch clin ap kii jarurat he or shaayad aisa mujhe lagata he, or jo log isse familior hai unke liye ye koi samasya na ho
 My primary phone is Google Pixel 3XL and talking about the camera app of these two, it is easier to use the camera of pixels in it
 maine kuch selfi bhi clic kii he or ye lo lite main kii hai image procecing mujhe pasand nahin aayaa
 EMUI 9 in P30 Pro
 1 diya gaya he jo Android 9 Pie par besd he
 But still this user interface is different from stock Android
 lekin phir jahaan tak meraa sawaal he to mujhe P30 Pro ke settings or fitures kaaphi shandaar lage hai
 But it may be different for some users, also for power users
 Huawei P30 Pro puri tarah se style ke bare main
 Its premium design and unique camera
 donon and par mere first impressant ye he ki huaave safal hua he
 But a phone is also apart from the design and camera
 yah dizin, camera ke saath or bhi chizon kaa mishran he
 Expectation from any flagship smartphone is high
 kya P30 Pro ise match karata he? ham is bare main aapako kuch samay baat bataane kii sthiti main honge jab ise behatar tareeke se yuj kar lenge
 But for now, all i can say is that if you want a premium phone that has a killer camera and classy design, then you should not hesitate to buy it when it will be launched in India in mid-april

 echivi ke itane maamle achaanak tab saamne aae jab 17 saal ke ek yuvak ke parijanon ne aspataal main jaakar uske khun kii jaanch karwaai
 When the medical report came out, the family's senses flew away, because the young man was suffering from HIV
 echivi grast yuvak ne parivaar ko bataaya ki vah or uske lagbhag 20 saathi ek hi sui kaa istemaal kar drugs apane sharir main pahunchaa rahe the
 On the other hand, when blood samples of the victims were taken, 8 of them were found to be HIV positive
 khabar failane ke baad echivi grast yuvakon ke parijan or prashasan maamle ko dabaane main jute gaye
 Now the medical reports of the remaining 8 people are not being made public
 sankramit suiyon ke jariye faileganvvaalon or echivi grast peedit yuvakon ke parivaar waalon ke mutabik jile main sankramit suiyon ke jariye faile echivi ke rogiyon kii sankhya kai guna zyada ho sakati he
 The top officials of the Congress government, which failed to curb drug abuse in the state, are engaged in suppressing the matter
 aanan-fanan main police ne jahaan ek hi din main 17 logon ke khilaaf drug pedling ke maamle darj kiye
 At the same time, some youths were also taken to drug prevention centers
 prashasan ke khilaaf logon main gussaudhar gaanv main echivi ke sankraman ke baad ek taraf jahaan logon main police or prashasan ke khilaaf gussa he vahiin pachhtaawaa bhi, kyonki yah gaanv sikh samrajya ke sansthaapak maharaja ranjit singh ke sansthaapak maharaja ranjit singh kaa naunihaal bhi he
 On the other hand, the biggest reason for spreading HIV virus among the youth of the village is the use of infected and used needles
 ajtak dwaara kii gai padtaal main saamne aayaa he ki gaanv ke kai sthanon par istemaal kii gai suiyaan, nashili dawaai or syringe bikhri padi hai
 The village youth was using these same things to bring intoxication into his body
 congress sarkaar roak lagane main naakamjaahir he rajya kii congress sarkaar apane do saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan nashe kii aapurti or istemaal par roak lagane main naakaam rahi he
 Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh vowed that he would end the addiction within 4 weeks
 nasha khatm karnaa to dur uskaa istemaal or zyada bad gaya he
 In the village of Sangrur, after 16 youths were found to be suffering from HIV and HCV disease, it is estimated that dozens of youth in the state may be suffering from HIV due to drug addiction
 nako kii ek taaja report ke mutabik punjab main pichley 11 saalon main aids 6081 se zyada logon kii jaan le chukaa he
 In the year 2017, the number of HIV patients in the state has increased by 2% and 406 new cases have been reported
 punjab sarkaar ke samaksh ek or jahaan rajya main bad rahe narko terrorism ko rokane kii chunauti he
 At the same time, now the second challenge of the deadly virus like HIV is also left
 karnataka main congress or bijepi ek baar phir jodtod kii koshish kii vajah se aamane-saamne hai
 The open letter written by DK Shivkumar, the Minister of Power in the congress-jds shared government, has become a reason for controversy this time
 dike sivakumar jinhen karnataka main 'di phecto' mukhyamantri mana jaataa he, ke ek patr kii vajah se ab vivaad uth khadaa hua he
 It has been written in this letter that the doors of Congress are open for BJP leaders of Chenpatna
 jo congress kii vichaardhaara se judana chaahate hai ve jab chahen party se jud sakate hai, ve log jo saamaajik nyaay, vikaas, dharmanirpekshata main bharosa rakhte hai
 The BJP, surrounded by allegations of trying to topple the jds-congress shared government, has found a way of defending the sitting
 bijepi ke pravaktaa es prakaash ne kaha he ki congress kaaryakarta party chhod rahe hai
 In such a situation, the Congress has written this to the BJP leaders in a fit of rage
 lekin isse hamaari party ko nuksaan nahi pahonchega
 The Congress has been continuously accusing the BJP of breaking up its mlas by giving Rs 25 to 30 crores
 congress kaa aarope he ki bijepi kisi bhi tarah karnataka main sarkaar giraane kii firaaq main he
 State Congress President Dinesh Gondu Rao said that see Yogeshwar was in Congress earlier
 ve kaaryakartaaon ke saath bijepi main gaye
 We are trying to return these people
 lekin bijepi kii tarah oparation kamala chalaakar vidhayakon kii kareed-farokt karnaa, ye sab nahin
 Actually, the atmosphere of Lok Sabha elections has started
 aise main jedies congress ke saath-saath bijepi un ilaakon main apni pakad majboot karne kii koshish main juty he jahaan thodi bhi kami dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, this type of pull will be seen more in the coming days
 bihar main bijepi kii haar or is babat party main mache ghamaasan ke bich kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah kaa bachaav kiya he
 Putting the responsibility of the defeat on the entire party, Gadkari said that BJP has not been defeated due to any one person
 parivahan mantri ne kaha ki bijepi isse pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi or laal krishna adwani ke daur main bhi chunaav haari he
 The Union Minister said, 'it is unfair to blame Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah for the defeat in Bihar elections
 ' yahi nahin, gadakari ne seniornetaaon kii naarazgior unke dwaara jari kiye gaye bayaan par aapatti jataate hue kaha ki piem or party adhyaksh ke khilaaf gairjimmedaarana bayaan dene waalon ke viraddh kadi karrwai kii jaani chahie
 Former party president Gadkari has also dismissed speculation about Shah's removal from the post of president in view of the defeat in Bihar elections
 do or purv party adhyaksh kar chuke hai bachaavisase pehle gadakari ke alaava do or purv adhyaksh venkaiya naidu or rajnath singh ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha tha ki haar kii saajha jimmedaari lene kii parampara atal bihari vaajapeyi aurlakkrishna adwanike samay se he
 MP warns of march till home Meanwhile, BJP MP from Ballia, Bharat Singh has warned elderly leaders
 unhone buudhvaar ko kaha ki senior netaaon ko bihar chunaav main party kii haar ke liepiem modi or amit shaahako jimmedaar nahin tehraana chahie
 Bharat Singh has demanded that the four senior leaders withdraw their statements and if they do not do so, Singh will march to the leaders' house
 gauratlab he ki bihar vidhansabha chunaavon main karaari haar ke badamangalvaar ko bijepi kii andruni kalhus vakt khulkar saamne aa gai, jab bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani, murali manohar joshi, yashavanth sinha or shanta kumaar ne pradhanmantri ke netritv ke khilaaf naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha ki pichley ek saal main party shaktiheen hui he or use kuch mutthi bhar logon ke anusaar chalane par majaboor kiya ja rahaa he
 The elderly leaders raised the issue of ignoring the senior leaders in the party and said that the responsibility of the defeat in Bihar should be fixed
 My condolences are with families of those who lost lives in this incident

 ' In December 2012, the wife of Chief Justice of India Altamas Kabir bought the Mekhala Chadar of Pat Silk, a traditional garment of Assam, from the Bimal Medhi shop in Sualkuchi, 45 km from Guwahati
 medhi ke sasur assam ke is gaanv main resham kii bunai karne vaale 40 hathkarghon ke ek kaarkaane ke maalik hai
 He was visited by former President APJ Abdul Kalam on October 17, 2006
 par 42 varshiya medhi aaj badanaami kaa dard jhel rahe hai
 They have been branded as black merchants
 pichley maheene 29 march ko kareeb 1,000 logon kii bheed ne unke ghar or vahiin sthit unki dukaan par hamalaa bol diya
 Thousands of mulberry silk kept in the shop were burnt to ashes
 dekhne main sualkuchi kii pat silk kii tarah hi lagane vaali yah mekhala chadar uttar pradesh ke mubarakapur or islampur ke handluumon main banaai gai thi
 Locals call them Banarasi pats
 hamalaa karne waalon main shaamil mrinal vaisya (badla hua naam) kaa kahana he ki medhi or unke teen bhai banarsi pat ko sualkuchi kii pat silk bataakar bechate hai
 But Medhi denies the charge
 medhi ne india today se kaha, ‘‘ham 25 varshon se banarsi or asmi silk bech rahe hai
 We never mix the two together
 hamaare graahakon ko pataa hota he ki ve kya kharid rahe hai
 We are proud of our Assamese clothing
 ’’kuch beyimaan vyapaariyon ke is banarsi silk ko hi assam kaa silk bataakar bechney kii vajah se hi 29 march ko assam ke kapadaa udyog ke garh main dange jaisi sthiti paidaa ho gai thi
 Some of the weavers here stopped a Marwari businessman from Dibrugarh, who was on his way home with 25 Banarasi pats
 usne inhen asmi pat samajhakar sualkuchi main manoj kumaar naam ke ek vyakti se 2 lakh ru
 Bought in gussaye bunakaron ne kapadon ko aag ke hawaale kar diya or manoj kumaar kii dukaan main todfod kar di
 Within an hour, a crowd of about a thousand people gathered there and people attacked the houses of Deepak Kumar, a big silk merchant of Medhi and village
 bheed jab medhi ke ghar ko tahas-nahas karne ke baad laut rahi thi, to police se unka takaraav ho gaya or police ne goliyaan chalaa deen
 Ten people, including two security personnel, were injured in the clash
 sthiti kii gambhirtha ko dekhte hue karfu laga diya gaya, jise teen din baad hataa liya gaya
 Assam's silk industry employs 25,000 people
 inamen 50 fisadi mahilaayein hai
 Sualkuchi has around 12,000 looms
 assam main banarsi silk kam-se-kam teen dashakon se bik rahi he
 But the crisis began in 2008, when some traders in Assam started making Asami Mekhala sheet-like cloth from the weavers of Mubarakpur and Islampur
 un bunakaron ne pat silk kii nakal taiyaar kerani shuru kar di, jo apekshaakrit kaaphi sasti hoti thi
 Fake clothing in the market of Assam soon became full
 deepak kumaar sweekaar karte hai ki unhone yahaan ke belboote or dizin uttar pradesh bheje the
 But for this they blame the shortage of weavers in Assam and their increasing remuneration
 hinsa ko dekhte hue jila prashasan ne asthaayee taur par banarsi silk kii bikri par roak laga di he
 Many shops have also been raided
 bunai ke ek kaarkaane ke maalik khanikar das kehete hai, ‘‘asthaayee upayon se kuch nahin hone vaala he
 If the government is serious, then it should make a textile policy within a month
 ’’ lekin tab tak to resham kii jang jari hi rahegi

 Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has threatened to drag troubled prime minister Nawaz Sharif to the Supreme Court, disqualifying him for allegedly lying about protesters and the army in Parliament
 baharhaal, raajnneetik gatirodh hal hone ke koi sanket nahin dikh rahe hai
 Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) president Imra Khan addressed the protesters on Saturday night in front of Parliament, saying that he would remain on dharna until the government did not accept his demands, including Sharif's resignation

 In cricket, statistics also has its own thrill, one of the strange figures in cricket is also of the niners nineties
 koi ballebaaz jab 90 se 99 ke bich main out hota he to uske bare main kehete hai ki vah shatak banane kaa dabaav jhel nahin paaya
 One such figure is made when a batsman is out between 190 and 199
 is lihaaj se dekhen beetaa ek maheenaa behad khaas sabit ho hua he
 In the first innings of the Melbourne Test against India, Steven Smith could not complete his double century and was dismissed for 192
 usase thik ek din pehle yani 26 disambar, 2014 ko christchurch main newzealand ke captain brandan maikkalam ne tufaani 195 ran thok die
 mccallum scored 195 off just 134 balls, if he had scored five more runs, he would have had the fastest double century in Test history
 ek maheene pehle 26 november ko sharajah main khele gaye pakistan or newzealand ke bich khele gaye tisare test match ke pehle din mohammad hafeez ne behtareen 197 ran thok die
 In response, Kane Williamson hit 192 runs in the New Zealand innings
 yani 26 november se lekar 27 disambar ke bich cricket ke maidan main chaar ballebaazon ne 190 kaa aankada paar kiya, lekin ve doharaa shatak nahin bana paae
 The strange coincidence is that this was the first time in the career of the three batsmen, except Brandon mccallum, when he came close to scoring a double century in Test matches, but could not complete it
 vaise maikkalam or steven smith ab test itihaas ke kramash terahaven or chaudaaven captain ban gaye hai, jinhone captain ke taur par 190 se zyada ran banaae, lekin doharaa shatak puraa nahin kar paae
 Australian captain Ian Chappell is the only captain who was dismissed as captain twice between 190 and 199
 ian chapel, bharat ke mohammad ajaharuddin or england ke maaikel won apane kariyar main do-do baar 190 plus score main pahunche, lekin kabhi doharaa shatak nahin bana paae
 Pakistan's Mohammad Yousuf and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara have been dismissed three times between 190 and 199
 srilanka ke kumaar sangakara or zimbabwe ke endi flower test itihaas main mahaj do aise ballebaaz hai, jo 199 ran par note out rahe hai, haalanki donon apane kariyar main doharaa shatak banane main kaamyaab rahe
 Mohammad Azharuddin and Matthew Eliot of Australia are the only two batsmen in cricket history to be bowled out for 199 and were the best batsmen of their careers, while Martin Crowe is the only batsman to have been dismissed for 299, while Don Bradman was the South in 1932
 Not out for 299 runs in a Test match against Africa
 vaise virendra sahvaag or england ke elister cook test itihaas ke mahaj do aise ballebaaz hai, 90 se 99 ke bich, 190 se 199 ke bich or 290 se 293 ran ke bich out ho chuke hai
 And do you know, South African all-rounder Jack Kallis, who scored 45 centuries and 13289 runs in Test cricket, has never been out for 190 to 199 runs in his long career of 166 Tests
 thik yahi sthiti sunil gavaskar bhi rahi, jinhone 34 test shatak banaae or isamen kabhi 190 se 199 ke bich out nahin hue

 Most economic data of the country is showing that the economy of the country has improved during the three years of the Modi government
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ke pehle teen saal ke kaarykaal ke dauraan zyaadaatar aarthik maamalon ke jaankaron kaa maananaa rahaa ki kendra sarkaar ne arthvyavastha ko majbootee dene ke liye kai nitiyon main pherbadal kiya he
 Due to this, where the economic data remained weak during the first two years, but the effect of the policies of the Modi government has started to appear in the figures from the third year
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ke 10 ahm aankadon ko dekhne se saaf he ki duniya kii teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha jahaan maujuuda samay main vishwa kii sabase teji se viksit hone vaali arthvyavastha hone ke saath-saath aane vaale samay main dohari gati se badhane ke liye taiyaar ho rahi he
 To see these figures, on the one hand, the figures are after the completion of 10 years of the UPA government led by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (31 March 2014) and on the other, on the same parameters after the three years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's tenure
 Are the figures

 adaalat ke baahar patrakaron se baat karte hue kapil sibbal ne mukhyamantrishivraj singh chouhanako vyaapman ghotaale kii "jad" kaha
 Sibal alleged that the agencies investigating the Vyapam case, which included SIT, STF and CBI, did not conduct their investigations properly

 is jaanch main report di gai thi ki sabooton se chhedchhad kaa aarope jhooth he
 Defending Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Narottam defended Shivraj Singh Chauhan, saying that as soon as the case of Vyapam came to light, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh ji took action and handed over the investigation to the police
 congress ne police kii jaanch par asantosh jataayaa, to is maamle kii jaanch ke liye estf kaa gathan kiya gaya
 If the Congress did not believe it either, the SIT investigated the matter under the supervision of the High Court
 us par bhi bharosa nahin hua, to congress ke netaa supreme court chale gaye
 Here, when the Supreme Court refused to tamper with the Horde disc, when Shivraj proved innocent in every kind of investigation, then why is the Congress doing politics of allegations again and again

 a Congress leader allegedly called Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi 'pappu' on the whatsapp group
 media reporton ke mutabik is vajah se us netaa ko dandit karte hue party ke pad se hataa diya gaya
 For this reason, anti-congress parties are targeting the party
 darasal meerut congress ke netaa vivek pradhan ne da times of india se baat karte hue kaha ki congress whatsap group par kisi ne unako fansaane ke liye photoshop karke ise daal diya
 According to media reports, Pradhan was removed from the post including Meerut Congress President after the episode
 congress ne haalanki abhi tak is masale par koi pratikriya nahin di he lekin bijepi ne kaha ki isse congress ke bheetar kii 'chapalusee' jaahir hoti he
 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, "pappu was promptly punished but no one was punished for calling the army chief a street goon
" ''tippaniyan Actually, Sambit Patra's reference was towards Congress leader Sandeep Dixit
 sandip dikshit ne army chif ko shanivaar ko sadak kaa gunda kaha tha
 However, he apologized when the dispute escalated
 is par apni pratikriya dete hue rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki sandip dikshit kaa yah bayaan puri tarah asweekaarya he
 The BJP had asked Congress President Sonia Gandhi to apologize on this and also demanded to get Sandeep Dixit out of the party
 is maamle main vivek pradhan kaa kahana he ki vah rahul gandhi se milakar apana paksh rakhana chaahate hai
 But he will have to wait for it because Rahul Gandhi had announced on Tuesday that he was going to Italy to meet his grandmother

 Sandeep Dixit called the army chief a punk of the road on Saturday

 In this case, Vivek Pradhan says that he wants to meet Rahul Gandhi and present his case

 But this is completely wrong

 In fact, earlier officials had told that Mohammad Yasin's family posted in Jammu Kashmir Light Infantry Regiment informed the police that some people came to their house in Kazipura Chadura and took Yasin
 yaccin chuttee par ghar aayaa tha
 However, it is now clear that the young Mohammad Yasin has not been kidnapped and he is completely safe

 The BJP sought former Prime Minister Pt
 China for permanent membership of China in the Security Council
 jawahar laal nehru ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley referred to Pandit Nehru's letter to the Chief Ministers of the states on August 2, 1955, stating, 'informally, the United States has advised that China be given a place in the United Nations and India will replace China in the Security Council
 ham nishchit rup se ise sweekaar nahin kar sakate kyonki iskaa matlab he china ko alag karnaa hoga or yah ek mahaan desh ke liye bahut anuchit hoga ki china suraksha parishad main nahin he
 'former Prime Minister Pandit Nehru also had to grapple with these questions in Parliament whether India was offered permanent membership in the Security Council? On September 27, 1955, Member of Parliament Dr
 jeen paarekh kii taraf se puche gaye sawaal ke jawaab main pandit nehru kehete hai, 'is tarah kaa koi prastaav, aupchaarik yaa anaupchaarik nahin he
 Some vague references have appeared in the press about this which have virtually no basis
 isamen (suraksha parishad) koi bhi parivartan charter main sanshodhan ke bina nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore, there is no question of offering the seat and India's refusal
 hamaari ghoshit niti sanyukt raashtra kii sadsyta ke liye yogya sabhi deshon ke pravesh kaa samarthan karnaa he
 'the United Nations was established in 1945 and along with it the Security Council was formed, in which the nationalist governments of America, the then Soviet Union, Britain, France and China were given permanent membership
 is bich china kii rashtravaadi sarkaar or maao tse tung kii communist party ke bich grihayuddh chhid gaya
 In which the Chinese Communists won and Nationalist government leader Chiang Kai-shek had to flee with his supporters and take refuge on the island of Taiwan
 hameshaa se communiston ke khilaaf rahane vaale america, britain or france, samyavaadee china ko suraksha parishad main nahin chaahate the
 But the Communist government of China was recognized in 1950
 jawahar laal nehru uniwarsity main centre for east-asian studies kii professor alka acharya kaa maananaa he ki us samay suraksha parishad main china kii seat ko lekar vivaad tha ki iskaa asli hakdaar china ke mukhya bhoomi kii communist sarkaar hogi yaa taiwan kii sarkaar
 There is no clear mention that this seat was offered to India
 lekin pandit nehru kaa mat tha ki sabase pehle niyamon ke mutabik is vivaad ko suljhaayaa jaae jis par china kaa aupchaarik haq tha
 Pro
 acharya kaa kahana he ki us samay kaa daur alag tha
 Then there was talk of building a strong Asia
 jisamen bharat-china kii saajhedaari majboot asia kii disha main ahm thi
 No one knew then that india-china relations would deteriorate later
 isliye is ghatana ko ek sandarbh se baahar nikaalkar nahin dekhnaa chahie
 According to experts, in the era of Pandit Nehru, there are two informal offers of giving permanent membership of Security Council to India
 jisamen ek baar saal 1950 main america kii taraf se or duusari baar 1955 main soviet sangh kii taraf se peshkash shaamil he
 In this, the offer made by America in 1950 was due to the fear of communists, then the Soviet Union made this offer with enthusiasm
 yah daur sheet yuddh kaa daur tha jisamen agar bharat, america ke saath khadaa dikhataa to soviet sangh virodh karata or soviet sangh ke saath khadey hone par america virodh karata
 It is also interesting to note that even in the present Modi government, America, France and Russia have been very supportive in favor of giving permanent membership of India to UN Security Council
 lekin niyam ke mutabik suraksha parishad main badlaav ke liye sanyukt raashtra ke charter main sanshodhan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Which requires the support of two-thirds majority of the total members as well as the support of the five permanent members
 iske alaava sthaayee sadsyta lene kii qatari main bharat ke alaava germany, japan, brazil or anya desh bhi khadey hai
 So keeping all these obstacles aside, saying that in the case of China, saying 'yes' to Pandit Nehru makes a difference is being called simplification of a complex problem

 is deal ke mutabik, ab tak food security bill kii mukhaalafat karne vaali sapa sansad main ise paas karaane main congress kii madad karegi
 It has been claimed, by petitioner Vishwanath Chaturvedi in the disproportionate case against Mulayam
 aaj tak se exclusive baatcheet main vishwanath chaturvedi ne kaha he, 'mulaayam or unke bete akhilesh yadav ke khilaaf aay se adhik sapantti maamle main jald sibiai closer report daakhil kar sakati he
 In return, the SP will support the food security bill
 ' haalanki congress ne in khabaron kaa khandan kiya he
 According to Vishwanath Chaturvedi, a Union Minister has threatened to kill him
 unhone kaha, 'ek kendriya mantri ne mujhe bulaakar jaan se maarane kii dhamkee di or kaha ki is baar mulaayam singh ko or tang mat karnaa varanaa maar die jaaoge
 'the petitioner has claimed that he will disclose the name of this minister by filing an affidavit in the court
 vishwanath chaturvedi ne kaha, 'ye choron kii sarkaar he
 Something similar happened at the time of the nuclear deal
 us vakt akhilesh yadav kii patni dimple yadav ke khilaaf cese band hua tha
 Now the turn will be given to Mulayam and Akhilesh
 haalanki congress party ne vishwanath chaturvedi ke in daavon ko galat bataaya he
 Party spokesman Raj Babbar has said, 'the Congress party never deals with anyone
 mulaayam singh kaa maamla court main he
 The decision on this will also be there
 'vahiin, sapa supremeo jab shanivaar ko media ke saamne aae to unhone ek baar saaf kiya ki unki party sansad main food bill kaa virodh karegi
 He said that SP is against the existing law
 'neech raajnneeti' karne ke priyanka gandhi ke aarope kaa narendra modi ne apane hi andaaz main jawaab diya he
 Modi has associated it with his backward caste background
 mangalvaar subah unhone ek ke baad ek is mudde par chaar twit kiye
 In this, Modi said that "I have come from socially lower class, therefore my politics will be 'low politics' for those people
 '' In fact, in Amethi yesterday, Priyanka had responded to the way Narendra Modi targeted one Gandhi family after another
 modi ne purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi par andhra pradesh ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri kaa apmaan karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 Similarly, he also took on the Gandhi family for the alleged insult of former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and former Congress President Sitaram Kesari
 iske jawaab main priyanka ne kaha ki ''unhone amethi kii dharti par mere shahid pita kaa apmaan kiya he
 The people of Amethi will never forgive this act
 inaki 'neech raajnneeti' kaa jawaab mere booth ke kaaryakarta denge
 The answer will come from each booth in Amethi
 '' For the first time, the issue of caste of Narendra Modi coming from the backward class has not come up
 kuch congressi netaaon ke isi tarah ke bayanon par pehle bhi hangaamaa ho chukaa he
 Senior Congress leader and Union Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, comparing Modi and Manmohan Singh, once said where Raja Bhoj and ou Gangu Teli
 bijepi ke tikhaa aitaraaz karne ke baad congress kii ore se safai ai thi ki ise muhaavarey ke taur par istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Narendra Modi has also cited his backward class earlier
 is saal janvari main dilli ke ramlila maidan par rashtriya parishad ke apane bhaashan main bhi unhone khud ke pichde varg se aane kii baat kahi thi or party kaa is baat ke liye aabhaar jataayaa tha ki unhen pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar jaisi mahatvapurn zimmedaari saunpi gai he
 However, in caste-critical Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, this identity has been tossed for the first time in the election phase
 in donon hi rajyon main matdaan ke do antim charan bache hai
 The first two rounds of voting in both the places have been extremely favorable for the BJP
 jabaki uske baad khaastaur se bihar main lalu prasad ke paksh main musalmaan or yadav kaa maai gathjod tezi se dhruvikrut hote dekha gaya he
 Similarly, after Bundelkhand, Awadh, now in Purvanchal, Modi wave is hitting the walls of caste
 jabaki pashchimi uttar pradesh main mujffarnagar dangon ke baad bane sampradayik maahaul kaa sidhaa-sidhaa phayda bijepi ko miltaa dikh rahaa tha
 The BJP had decided not to lift Narendra Modi's OBC card prominently in Uttar Pradesh
 iske peeche ek vajah ye bhi bataai gai thi ki modi jis ghanchi samaaj se aate hai rajya main uske adhik matadaata nahin hai
 At the same time, underlining this identity more effectively, there was also the possibility of the backward class being divided rather than united because perhaps other sections of the backward class felt that their society was not getting a share of power
 isi tarah lambey samay baad brahman matadaata bijepi kii taraf waapas aa rahe hai
 The party did not want to bounce Modi's OBC identity to him
 bijepi ke ranneetikaar kehete hai ki mandir andolan ke baad pehali baar uttar pradesh-bihar main yadavon ko chhod baaki sari pichhadi jatiyaan bijepi ke paksh main ikatthi hoti dikh rahi hai
 Modi's coming from the backward classes is one of the reasons
 lekin ek or kaaran unki hindutv ke poster boy kii chhavi hona bhi he
 That is why the BJP has given about one-third of the 24 tickets to backward class candidates
 patel, kushvaha, kurmi ke alaava lodh, nishad, bind, kevat, mallaah, saini, prajapati, nonia, bhurji, baari, nai, shakya, saini jaise pichde varg kii jatiyon par bijepi ne khaas dhyaan diya he
 Similarly, BJP has also been eyeing non-jatav Dalit society
 inamen valmiki, paasi, khatic or kori shaamil hai jo 21 fisadi dalit voton main se nau fisadi hai
 Except Yadav, Muslim and Jatav, it has been trying to get all the votes in its favor
 ye sahi he ki priyanka ke bayaan kii vajah se hi modi ko apane pichhadi varg kii pahchaan bataane kaa mauka mila he
 It is also beneficial for BJP
 purvanchal kii jin 33 siton par antim do daur main matdaan hona he vahaan bijepi ke paas sirf chaar siten hai
 The BJP feels that caste equations are seen going against its candidates in many seats
 aise main modi kaa obisi card chalanaa koi hairaani kii baat nahin he

 Two veteran Congress leaders have come face to face over the Padmavati controversy
 purv kendriya mantri or congress netaa shashi tharur ne maharaajaaon ko kaayar bataaya, to jyotiraditya sindhiya ne jabardast palatwaar kiya he
 He advised that Shashi Tharoor should first read the history that what was the role of Maharajas? Also, such rhetoric should be avoided
 4- 18 saal 8 din ke prithvi ne ranjai main banaaya shatakon kaa bada recordmumbai ke salaami ballebaaj prithvi shaw ne ek or badi uplabdhi hasil kar lee he
 He scored a century (114 runs) on Friday on the first day of the Ranji match being played in Ongole against Andhra Pradesh
 iske saath hi ranjai trophy main unke naam ab 4 shatak ho gaye hai
 Prithvi's name of 18 years 8 days has now reached a record century in Ranji Trophy
 itani kam umr main 4 shatak kisi ke naam nahin hai
 With this, Earth has now got 5 centuries in first class cricket, which at this age is the highest century after Sachin Tendulkar

 The BJP has given 49 mlas a second chance in its list
 congress se aane vaale netaaon ko bhi tikat diya gaya he
 In its first list, BJP has taken full care of the caste equation

 ' Recently Ajay Devgan has launched the trailer of the film 'parched'

 When Ajay Devgansey asked a journalist about the film's intemacy scenes, are these scenes included in the film true to the Indian audience? So Ajay Devgan said, 'you have seen the scenes, are you happy? You have piracy because you see

 And then when an incident like online leaks occurs, it is very easy for people to download and watch it
 lekin un logon kaa kya hota he jo barabaad ho jate hai?' Rejecting the Modi government's offer to negotiate the controversial Land Acquisition Bill, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday said talking about the debate after imposing anti-farmer legislation is like ridiculing the tradition of consensus building between the ruling party and the opposition
 unhone is vidheyak ko desh kii ridh todane vaala bataate hue kaha ki vah kabhi iskaa samarthan nahin kar saktin
 Sonia alleged that the 'short-sighted' Modi government was bent on giving benefits to industrialists
 unhone maang kii ki sankeern raajnneeti se upar uthakar 2013 main upie dwaara laae gaye bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon ko samagrata main waapas laayaa jaae
 Sonia Gandhi, while responding strongly to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's letter on the issue of Land Acquisition Bill, said, "the amendment has brought you through any debate and discussion
" sarkaar dwaara manamaane dhang se kisaan virdohi kanoon thope dene ke baad bahes kii baaten karnaa rashtriya mahatv kii nitiyaan lagu karne ke pehle satta paksh or vipaksh ke bich sarvanumati banane kii parampara kaa uphaas karne ke barabar he
 ' bhoomi vidheyak kaa virodh karne waalon ko raashtra virdohi ke rup main pesh karne ke liye sarkaar kii aalochana karte hue sonia ne apane jawaab main kaha, ‘kisaan hamaare desh kii ridh hai or har haal main unke hiton kii raksha honi hi chahie or is par congress koi samjhauta nahin kar sakati
 We can never support any law that breaks the backbone of this country
 isliye main aapse aagrah karti hum ki sankeern pakshpatpurna raajnneeti se upar uthen or 2013 ke us kanoon ko samagrata main waapas laaen jo ki hamaare kisaan bhaaiyon evam bahanon kii bhaawanaaon or aakankshaon ke anukool tha
 ' sonia ne gadakari ke 19 march ke patr ke jawaab main kaha, ‘spasht kahuun to, isamen ardhsatyon or kuvyakhyaaon kaa pradarshan dekhakar chakit rah gai
 Well, i should not have been surprised, in the absence of logical and persuasive arguments, your government is accustomed to do so
 ’ He said that Gadkari in his letter has tried to justify the proposed changes in land acquisition by saying that it will benefit the villages, the poor, farmers and laborers
 
 Your arguments have been given to show that all these things are contrary to the UPA government like the new contribution of the Narendra Modi government, and those who oppose your law are anti-farmer and anti-national
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘khed is baat kaa he ki jo kuch aapane kaha he vah puri tarah niraadhaar he
 
 or ab to yah vyapak rup se mana ja rahaa he ki aapaki sarkaar bilkul kisaan virdohi, garib virdohi he or mutthibhar nijee partiyon ko laabh pahunchane ke liye samaaj ke kamjor tabakon ke hiton kaa balidaan kar rahi he
 Sonia alleged that the Modi government completely undermined the law on the pretext of making amended mandates ordered by the 2013 law itself, which hurt the farmers across the country
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki raksha, sinchai or vidyutikaran ke muddon par modi sarkaar kii baaten, asal main kisaan virdohi sanshodhano se dhyaan hataane kii ‘bedadak koshish’ bhar he
 Sonia said that there can be no two opinions about whether the country has to increase its irrigation capacities and build more domestic defense factories and improve rural infrastructure
 lekin yah sab kisaanon ko dayaneey dasha main pahunchaakar or unki aajeevika nasht karke nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Congress president said, "these issues have been discussed in the 2013 Act to further the rural infrastructure and defense industry, but without sacrificing the interests of the farmers
" ’ pichley saptaah gadakari ne bhoomi vidheyak ko puri tarah se kisaan hitaishi bataate hue sonia gandhi, vipaksh ke netaaon or saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare ko is mudde par khuli charchaa ke liye aamantrit kiya tha
 In his letter written in response to this, the Congress President said, 'your claim that the 2013 law is a hindrance in the way of promoting national security and irrigation and rural development is completely baseless and unacceptable
 ’ He further said that as far as the Industrial Corridor is concerned, i do not understand that the provision of acquisition of one kilometer of land on both sides of the corridor was not in the 2013 law, why did your government think it needed to amend it? Sonia said, "this will benefit the private traders of the land at the cost of the original landowners, not the Corridor project

 The 2014 Lok Sabha election is special in many ways for the country's politics
 phir chaahe vah aam aadmi party kaa udai ho yaa banate-bigadate rishton kii baangi
 But one particular thing that is visible among all this is the return of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a political force
 jabaki vidambnaa yah he ki aresas khud ko ek raajnneetik kalakaar ke rup main nahin dekhtaa
 The Sangh considers itself a cultural organization, which aims to increase nationalism and the basic element is the defense of Hinduism
 maujuuda daur main aresas jis mukaam par he yakeenan yah rasta aasaan nahin tha
 This process continued to work well over the last decade, especially since the party's defeat in 2004
 is dauraan kuch aisi baaten bhi huin jo isamen kaaphi madadgaar raheen, jaise atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa bistar pakad lenaa, pramod mahajan kii aakasmik mrityu or laal krishna adwani kaa jinna kii tarif karke khud ko musiibat main daalana
 But the real change came in 2009 when the ineffective KS Sudarshan was removed from the post of Sarsanghchalak and Mohanrao Bhagwat was made the head of the organization
 mohanrao bhagwat ke adhyaksh banane ke baad aresas ne badi yojanabaddh tareeke se bijepi kaa niyantran apane haathon main liya or 2009 main party kii asafalataa ke baad nitin gadakari ko party kaa adhyaksh banavaa diya
 Bhagwat has been rss's number two since 2000
 unhone vaajapeyi kaal main bijepi ko satta ke shikhar par dekha tha
 He knew that the Sangh did not run in front of Vajpayee
 vaajapeyi ne sangh ke zyaadaatar netaaon ko batte khate main daal diya tha
 Even used to ignore Sudarshan
 shishyon ne badhaai bhagwat kii taqatsangha main bhagwat kii sarvocchata kabhi sawaalon ke ghere main nahin rahi
 But due to his disciples Suresh (bhakya ji) Joshi Dattatreya Hosabale and Suresh Soni, his strength increased further
 hosaable or soni apane bauddhik kaaryon ke liye jane jate hai
 He has been among the best organizers and strategists
 ve raajnneetigyon kii tarah kaam nahin karte
 This is also the role of the RSS, not a teacher, but a political player
 in teenon ne pehle to dilli kii tikdi laal krishna adwani, sushamaa swaraj or murali manohar joshi ko kinare kiya
 Arun Jaitley, the fourth major leader of Delhi, was made part of the second major plan
 yojana rajnath singh ko adhyaksh banane kii thi
 Along with this, the inclusion of Narendra Modi, the party's most popular leader in his trusted team
 in sabhi main sangh ko jabardast safalataa mili
 It was the result of this plan that today, under the leadership of Modi, BJP stands at the door of the biggest success in history
 modi se laabh bhi, samasya bhidansal, iskaa matlab yah bhi nahin ki aresas ajey he yaa use apana bhagya gadhane se roka nahin ja saktaa
 The problem is that history is not mechanical nor created by humans
 marks ne kaha tha ki maanav apana itihaas to banaata he lekin vaisaa nahin jaisaa vah chahta he
 Now we have Narendra Modi in front of us
 vah pakke sanghee hai
 He is a staunch supporter of Sangh's Hindu nationalism
 lekin saath hi unki apni icchhaaen hai or vah nirankush bhi hai jo aresas ko kai baar pasand nahin aata he
 It is well known that as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, he had neither the time for the RSS nor the Vishwa Hindu Parishad
 sangh ko yah pataa he ki yah chunaav modi ke agenda par ladaa ja rahaa he or isamen vikaas or sushasan kii baat kii ja rahi he
 Caste and religion are secondary in this
 lekin vah is par shikaayat nahin kar sakati kyonki modi ko abhootpurv dhang se bijepi ke vot mil rahe hai or yah vahi bijepi he jiske bare main sangh kii soch he ki vah uske niyantran main he
 In such a situation, Modi needs the Sangh Parivar until he becomes Prime Minister
 sarkaar jo sambhawatah gathbandhan sarkaar hogi, kii jaruraton ke anusaar unhen kaam karnaa hi hoga
 In such a situation, in ruling India, they will be confronted with those ideas which dream of another type of India
 yah sabak tab mil chukaa he jab sangh ke anya prachaarak atal bihari vaajapeyi bharat ke pradhanmantri bane the
 Pakistan is going through a severe economic crisis and if it does not get a loan of $ 12 billion within six weeks, then the country will be difficult to handle
 yah baat kisi or ne nahin, balki imran kii hone vaali cabinet main vitt mantri ke daavedaar asad umr ne kahi he
 He said that the previous government had left the country in severe economic crisis
 pakistani company angro corporation ke purv pramukh rahe asad umr ne kaha ki desh main 10 se 12 arab dollar kii gambhir vittiya kami he
 Talking to the news agency Bloomberg, Asad Omar said that not only that, since the country is absolutely 'on the verge', the new government will also need some extra money to handle it
 umr ne kaha, 'pakistan ko agle chah hafton ke bheetar hi kai nirnay lene honge
 The longer it is, the greater the difficulty
 ' unhone kaha ki pakistan madad ke liemef,dost deshon se baat karegaa
 In addition, diaspora bonds will also be issued
 china or imef par daaromadargauratlab he ki imran khan pakistan ke piem banane kii taiyaari to kar rahe hai, lekin vahaan kii khastahal arthvyavastha unke liye sabase badi chunauti he
 Many investors and experts feel that Pakistan will be difficult to handle if China and IMF do not give relief package
 gauratlab he ki 1980 ke dashak se ab tak imef pakistan ko 12 baar aarthik kaaryakramon ke dwaara madad kar chukaa he
 The last time the IMF was around 6
 6 arab dollar kaa raahat package diya tha or lagbhag itnaa hi karj china bhi de chukaa he
 All pacts from China will be public
 Assad also promised the public that after the formation of Imran Khan's government, all agreements with China from Pakistan will be made public

 The Modi government at the Center on Thursday presented its last full-time budget for this term
 kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ek ghante 50 minute ke apane bajet bhaashan main ek ghante kisaanon par baat karte rahe is dauraan unhone 24 baar kisaanon kii baat kii or 16 baar kheti kii zikr kiya
 Despite this, the country's farmer is not happy with the budget of the Modi government
 kareeb 200 kisaan sanghathanon ne apni maangon ko lekar 7 farvari se sadak par utarane kaa elaan kiya he
 The resentment of farmers is becoming a tension for the BJP
 gujarat se sabakbata den ki gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main kisaanon kii naaraazgi kaa nateeja tha ki bijepi ke haathon se satta jate-jate bachi thi
 Not only this, for the first time in the history of 22 years, BJP could not cross hundred figures
 gujarat se sabak lete hue modi sarkaar ne apane is kaarykaal ke aakhri bajet ke tahat kisaanon kii naaraazgi ko dur karne koshish ke tahat bajet main is disha main kadam badhaayaa
 The government had called it the farmers' budget
 kisaan sanghathanon ke aropakisaan sanghathanon kaa aarope he ki centre sarkaar ne 2019 main hone vaale loksabhaa chunaavon ko saamne rakh kar kisaanon ko lubhaane ke liye unki aamadani badhaane or nunatam samarthan mulya ko laagat se dedh guna karne kii baat to kii he, lekin ye sab kagaji he
 Against the budget, 200 farmers organizations have decided to sit on a dharna for a week from 7 February
 ye he kisaan sanghathanon kii maange1
 The government's way of deciding the cost of farming is wrong because it leaves the farmer ie the head of the family and considers his family as unskilled laborer, while the entire family of the farmer does farming
 isliye puure parivaar ko skild yani kushal majdoor mana jaae
 2
 kheti kii laagat tay karte vakt jameen kaa kiraaya bhi joda jaae kyonki kisaanon kaa ek bada varg khet kiraye par le kar kheti karata he
 3
 sarkaar kisaanon ko sabsidi ke naam par kuch riyaayaten to detii he lekin kheti kii laagat tay karte samay sabsidi gata detii he
 Farmers' organizations want the government not to reduce the subsidy from the cost while fixing the MSP
 4
 The MSP will not be able to get even one and a half times the cost of farming away from the farmer
 isliye emspi kaa nirdhaaran sahi ho or uske liye alag se koi fund kaa praavdhaan ho
 The government talks about MSP but does not guarantee that the produce of the farmer will be purchased in any case
 5
 The government should tighten the fine on non-purchasing agents and impose fines on them
 modi sarkaar ke sirdard bane kisandrasal centre sarkaar bajet main emspi kaa zikr karke funs gai he
 Farmers' organizations are alleging that in the last four years, more than 16 thousand farmers have committed suicide in the country and the income of the farmers has decreased instead of increasing
 naaraaz kisaan sanghathanon ne ab 7 farvari se deshvyapee pradarshan yojit karne kaa faisla liya he
 On the issue of farmers, Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been continuously raising the Modi government in the dock
 aise main 2019 ke dahalij par khadi modi sarkaar ke liye aane vaale dinon kisaan ke saath vipaksh sirdard banenge
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi had tweeted - "four years have passed; promises of fair prices to farmers are still being made
" chaar saal guzar gaye; fansy skims hai, lekin bajet ke saath koi match nahin he
 In the case of alleged fake letter of Aam Aadmi Party leader and Punjab in-charge Sanjay Singh, Punjab Police has registered an FIR on the complaint of Sanjay Singh
 punjab police ne maamle main ipisi kii dhara 465, 468 or 469 ke tahat anjaan logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya he
 Let us tell you that AAP leader Sanjay Singh made a written complaint to the Punjab Police
 sanjay singh ne aarope lagaaya tha ki unke naam se party ke mukhiya or dilli ke mukhyamantriaravind kejarivalko farji chitthee likhi gai thi
 In the letter, Kejriwal was quoted as having reduced rallies in Punjab, citing the party's weakness
 aam aadmi party ise virodhiyon kii sajeesh qaraar diya tha or punjab police ke paas likhit shikaayat darj karai thi
 After your complaint, on Friday, Punjab Police has registered an FIR against unknown people in the case
 videsh mantri banane ke baad pehali baar kisi kaarykram main shaamil hue es jaishankar ne kaha he ki duniya bhar main mushkilon main fanse bharatiyon kii madad zimmedaari he or isane videsh mantralay kii chhavi badal di he
 Speaking at the program of CII and think tank Ananta Aspen Center, Jaishankar said that earlier Indians had the image of embassies in the mind that only those who are identified in big places have their work and it is difficult to work there
 
 lekin purv videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne jo (soshal media) ke zarie shuruuaat kii usase ab logon kii ummiden hai, unhen jawaab miltaa he or videsh mantralay zamin se judaa he
 a few hours after his appointment as the foreign minister, it was clear that Jaishankar would also continue the tradition of Sushma Swaraj to help the common people on Twitter
 bimstek or saarc ke bare main baat karte hue unhone kaha ki adhiktar dakshin asian deshon ko pataa he ki connactivity se dur rahanaa unhen aage nahin badhane de rahaa
 Everyone knows the problem of SAARC
 agar aatankwaad ko pare rakhkar bhi sochen to connactivity vahaan par nahin ho paa rahaa
 Apart from this, there is an energy in BIMSTEC and it is ready to move forward
 nai sarkaar ke shapathgrahan main bhi bimstek deshon ke pramukhon ko aamantran isi se judaa he
 Talking about the neighboring countries, External Affairs Minister s Jaishankar also said that the main responsibility for development in this region is with India
 isse yahaan baakiyon kaa bhi vikaas hoga
 Big heart will have to be kept for the neighbors, even when the same behavior does not come from their side
 unhone is par bangladesh se behatar sambandhon kaa bhi udhaaharan diya
 When asked a question about his work as a foreign minister, he said that he had not dreamed a week ago that he would become a foreign minister
 mantralayon main samanvay par jor dete hue jaishankar ne kaha ki pichhlaa ek haftaa jitna vakt unhone apane mantralay main nahin bitaayaa usase kahin zyada vakt vitt or vaanijya mantralayon main bitaayaa he
 But this coordination is important and the old thinking that holds its land will have to be changed
 unhone ye bhi kaha ki jaise pradhanmantri modi alag-alag project kaa rivyuu karte hai vaise hi wo bhi videsh mantralay ke projects kaa maheene main kam se kam do baar rivyuu karnaa chaahate hai

 About three years ago, during a state meeting reporting on Goods and Services Tax (GST), a senior revenue department official told me that it is almost impossible to apply uniform tax rates on production, service and sales across India! At the time, i felt his remarks pointed to the state of annoyance and pointing towards industrialized states, because that round was a deadlock on GST and Gujarat had been opposing this reform for a decade
 jiesti par taaja rajnatik khinchataan ne us adhikari ko sahi sabit kar diya
 The face of the country's biggest tax reform has changed
 jiesti ke naam par hamen jo milane vaala he usase puure desh main kaaman market bananaa to dur, mahangaai badaae va kar prashasan main araajaktaa kaa jokhim sir par tang gaya he
 Taxes are complex, but after a decade of discussion on GST, people know that a wide variety of taxes (excise, service, VAT, CST, octroi, entertainment, tax) on production, sales and services in India from the center to the state
 Luxury, purchase), which not only motivates tax evasion, but is also a big reason for the price rise of products
 jiesti lagu kar in taxon ko khatm kiya ja saktaa he taaki puure desh main samaan tex rate ke jariye kaarobaar aasaan ho sake
 This will ultimately reduce the price of products and services for consumers
 lekin jiesti kaa prastaavit dhaancha is makasad se ulti disha main jaataa dikh rahaa he
 The excitement over GST hung in the balance for a decade was because Gujarat was the leader in those states which are not in favor of GST
 dilli pahunchane ke baad modi jiesti ke mureed ho gaye, jisase is tex sudhaar kii ummid ko takat mil gai
 But there was no change in the attitude of the states due to changing Modi's view of GST
 kerala ke vitt mantri va jiesti par rajyon kii samiti ke mukhiya ke
 M
 mani kii maane to gujarat or maharashtra ne dabaav banaaya ki sabhi tarah ke jiesti ke alaava, rajyon ko vastuon kii antarraji aapurti par ek fisadi atirikt tex lagane kii chhot milani chahie, utpaadakon ko jisaki vaapasi nahin hogi
 This tax will be given to the state from where the supply of goods starts
 gujarat kaa dabaav kargar rahaa
 This new tax is part of a bill passed by the Lok Sabha which will increase the revenue of industrialized states while other states will suffer
 is tarah audyogic va upabhokta rajyon ke bich puraani khai phir taiyaar ho gai he
 Therefore, the GST Bill can now not only get stuck in the Rajya Sabha but due to opposition from the states, the possibility of implementing it from next year has also come down
 siyasat ne jiesti kii tasviir puri tarah badal di he
 Now there will be not one but five tier structure of indirect tax
 sijisti ke tahat centre ke tex (exise, sarvice) lagenge or esgsti ke tahat rajyon ke tex
 Apart from this, IGST will be levied on interstate sales which will replace Central Sales Tax
 saamaan kii antarraji aapurti par ek fisadi atirikt tex or petrol dijal, aviation ful par tex alag se honge
 GST was going to bring a uniform tax structure across the country, even talk of separate centralized GST in the central state, but in the name of GST, there is going to be a structure of five taxes which is nothing short of trouble
 darasal, jiesti ke tahat utpaadakon or vyapaariyon ko kachche maal par die gaye tex kii vaapasi honi he taaki ek hi seva yaa utpaada par bahut se tex na lagen
 Now that the tax structure with multiple levels remains intact, the processing of millions of tax returns will be the biggest challenge
 agar jiesti apane maujuuda swaroop main aayaa to har roj hajaaron ritern file honge, jinhen jaanchane ke liye taiyaari nahin he
 a nationwide computerized tax network was to be created for GST, whose progress is not known while the tax systems of the states are of the older generation
 jiesti agar is tarah lagu hua to araajaktaa va rajasav nuksaan hi haath lagegaa
 What will be the rate of GST? The states' committee is indicating a GST rate of 27 per cent (revenue neutral rating at which the states will have no revenue loss)
 yah maujuuda ausat dar se das fisad zyada he
 If the GST rate is set above 20 per cent, then this biggest tax reform in India will be broken by inflation
 duniya ke jin deshon ne haal main jiesti lagu kiya he vahaan tex paanch (japan) se lekar 19
 5 percent (european Union)
 jiesti ke maamle main siyasat ko dekhte hue sarkaar ke liye yah dar kam rakh paanaa behad mushkil hoga
 Nothing has changed except the change of heart of Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding GST
 centre se lekar rajyon tak koi taiyaari nahin he
 The whole debate focuses only on the revenues of governments
 kar vasuulne va chukaane vaale, arthath vyapaaree va upabhokta andhere main hai
 GST is not a headline hoarding scheme or mission, it is India's most sensitive reform which is associated with the life of every rich and poor consumer
 sarkaar ko thaharkar isaki paryaapt taiyaari kerani chahie
 The Prime Minister should use his influence to make the states agree on this
 jiesti lagu na hone se jitna nuksaan hoga, usase kahin zyada nuksaan ise bagaiyr taiyaari ke lagu karne se ho saktaa he
 Most people do not understand the mathematics of tax
 lekin itnaa jarur samajhate hai ki zyada tex hone se mahangaai badhati he or agar puure desh main tex kii ek dar ho to kaarobaar aasaan hota he
 The draft of the GST which has been approved by the Lok Sabha will neither make business easy nor will inflation come down
 desh ko vah jiesti miltaa nahin dikh rahaa he jiskaa intjaar pichley ek dashak se ho rahaa tha

 - input IANS se The Modi government has appealed to the Supreme Court to hand over non-disputed land in Ayodhya to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas for the construction of Ram temple
 sarkaar ke is kadam ko lekar bahujan samaaj party kii supremeo mayawati ne pratikriya di he
 He said that the demand to return the disputed and authorized land to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas is an intervention in sheer justice and it is a step affecting the elections
 unhone kaha ki centre sarkaar kaa yah kadam chunaav ko dekhte hue liya gaya he jisase aam logon ko satark rahanaa chahie
 This game of disturbing the status quo on the land of Ayodhya owned by the Supreme Court is provoking
 bijepi chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhkar ise anjaam de rahi he
 Let us know that on Tuesday, the Modi government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, asking that the non-disputed site in Ayodhya be returned to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 centre sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya he ki jis bhoomi par ramajnmabhumi-babari masjid ko lekar vivaad he vah supreme court apane paas rakhe
 The government told the court that the share given to Hindu parties in Ayodhya should be given to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas
 uttar pradesh kii purv mukhyamantri ne kaha ki desh main jabardast garibi, manhagaai, berogari va ashiksha he, sarkaar isko hataane main naakaam rahi
 The wrong and political use of the Ayodhya case was left to the last gimmick, which the BJP has now begun to fully use

 5 lakhs
 haalanki foldable smartfones ke liye software customijeshan bhi ek samasya he jise companiyon ko tekal karnaa hoga
 Since no foldable smartphone is mainstream so far, it is difficult to say how it actually works

 china ke ek machuaare ko us vakt ‘life of paai’ film ke mukhya kirdaar jaise anubhav se do-chaar hona padaa jab hilonjiyang praant ke china-rus seemaa kshetra kii ek nadi main uskaa saamana ek junglee siberian baagh se hua
 Zhang Mingyu, 32, of Fuyuan County, noticed on the morning of June 11 that something was swimming in the Wusuli River
 jis vakt jhang ne yah dekha us vakt wo sanjiyang nechar rigerv kii taraf ja rahe the
 Zhang said, 'at first i thought he is a deer but suddenly he turned and roared at me
 usne meri naav par jhapatane kii koshish kii
 On hearing the roar of the tiger, Zhang became very scared and he jumped from the front of the boat to the back
 sarkari samachar agency ‘shinhua’ ke mutabik jhang ne bataaya, ‘uske maathe par kaali or pili dhaariyaan kaaphi spasht thim
 He was a tiger
 ’ jhang ne baagh ko vahaan se bhagane kii puri koshish kii or use naav par chadhane se rokane kii koshish karne lage
 Zhang said, 'he then tried to climb the boat from the other side and i pushed him again
 ’ baagh ne us vakt tak naav par chadhane kii koshish kii jab tak vah himmat nahin haar gaya or tairkar dur chalaa gaya
 Zhang also made a 10-minute video of the tiger swimming on his mobile

 Earthquake tremors have been felt in the area of delhi-ncr
 bataa den ki jitna zyada rector scale par bukamp aata he, utana hi adhik kampan hota he
 Like 7
 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par jahaan imaaraten gir jaati hai vahiin 2
 9 On the Richter scale there is a mild vibration when an earthquake occurs
 kisi bukamp ke samay bhoomi ke kampan ke adhiktam aayam or kisi arbitreri chote aayam ke anupaat ke saadhaaran ganit ko 'richter paimaana' kehete hai
 The 'vacant scale' is the full name of the Richter Magnitude Test Scale (richter Magnitude Test Scale) and in short it is Local Magnitude
 kyon aata he bukamp- dharti kii upree sataha saat tectonic platon se mil kar bani he
 Wherever these plates collide with each other, there is a risk of earthquake
 bukamp tab aata he jab in plates ek duusare ke kshetra main ghusane kii koshish karti hai, plates ek duusare se ragad khaati hai, usase apaar urja nikalati he, or us gharshan yaa friction se upar kii dharti dolane lagati he, kai baar dharti fat tak jaati he, kai baar hafton to kai baar kai maheenon tak ye urja rah-rahakar baahar nikalati he or bukamp aate rahete hai, inhen aftershock kehete hai
 Know what the impact can be according to the earthquake intensity on the Richter scale: - 0 to 1
 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par sirf sijmograph se hi pataa chalata he
 2 - 2 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par halkaa kampan hota he
 - 3 to 3
 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par koi trek aapke najadik se guzar jaae, aisa asar hota he
 - 4 to 4
 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par khidkiyaan tut sakati hai
 Hanged frames may fall on the walls
 - 5 se 5
 Furniture can move when an earthquake hits the 9 Richter scale
 - 6 se 6
 The foundation of buildings can collapse when an earthquake strikes the Richter scale
 upree manjilon ko nuksaan ho saktaa he
 - 7 to 7
 9 richter scale par bukamp aane par imaaraten gir jaati hai
 Pipes burst inside the ground
 - 8 se 8
 Large bridges including buildings also collapse when earthquakes occur on the 9 Richter scale
 - 9 or usase zyada richter scale par bukamp aane par puri tabaahi
 If someone is standing in the field, he will be seen waving the earth
 samandar najadik ho to tsunami
 In an earthquake, each scale of the Richter scale is 10 times stronger than the previous scale
 obama prashasan ne syria sthit roosi duutavas par guuruuvaar ko hui golabari kii ninda kii he or iske saath hi hamalaavaron ko sajaa die jane kii maang kii he
 News agency does, according to State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said, condemns the shelling went to targeted Russian embassy compound Thursday in US Damascus and the people and expressed concern for the injured died Xinhua
 saki ne kaha, ham antarrashtriya kanoon ke tahat surakshit kisi vyakti or sanstha par hue hamale kii ninda karte hai
 According to al-mayadin TV, three civilians were killed in an attack near the embassy by three mortars, while another attack was carried out in its premises, with no casualties

 Amanmani Tripathi, the son of the Samajwadi Party leader Amarmani Tripathi, a UP minister, and his wife Sara were in the same car
 car kaa accident ho gaya
 The wife lost her life, but the husband's hair was also not deterred
 to kya ye mahaj ittefaq he? hone ko kuch bhi ho saktaa he, lekin shaq tab gaharaata he jab pataa chalata he ki donon ke rishte thik nahin the
 a road accident in which a girl in a car dies on the spot, while the other person does not even get scratched
 ye car naa to kisi duusari gaadi se takaraati he, naa kisi divyder se or naa hi iskaa brake fail hota he
 Despite this, this car suddenly overturns on the middle road and the life of one of the two people in it is mysteriously lost
 upi ke purv mantri or samaajawaadee party ke netaa amarmani treepathi noujvaan kaviyitri madhumita shukla ke katl ke maamle main mujrim qaraar die jane ke baad in dinon umr kaid kii sajaa kaat rahe hai
 Whereas Amarmani's Sahabzade Amanmani is still absconding in the eyes of UP police in the case of kidnapping
 bataaya jaataa he ki amanmani or sara kii shaadi 2013 main hui thi
 But both were living separately for a long time
 isse bhi ajeeb baat ye he ki is haadase se mahaj 15 din pehle hi amanmani ne apni patnisara kii tarfek baar phir se sulah kaa haath badhaayaa tha or donon saath rahane lage the, lekin isse pehle ki donon kii jindagi kii gaadi or aage badhati, unki gaadi kaa accident ho gaya
 How did this accident happen in the highway, when the accident happened to overtake a vehicle and save a woman, but even after several days, neither the police came to know of the vehicle, which was being overtaken and neither woman was found , Who had an accident in an attempt to save him
 police ko bich sadak par hue is accident kaa ek adad chashmadid tak nahin mila
 Alam is that more people are skeptical of this than many people believe in road accident
 kab hua accidentkhabaron ke mutabik, guuruuvaar takreeban dedh baje is car kaa accident hota he
 The theory of this accident was told and then the things that came out in the investigation, like it suddenly made the matter complicated
 amanmani ne bataaya ki firozabad ke sirsaganj ilaake main kisi gaadi ko overtek karne ke dauraan unki car palat gai
 According to Aman, after overtaking, a woman came in front of his car and in an attempt to save him, the car fell uncontrollably and fell into the ditch under the road
 jaankaron kii maane to aam taur par kisi bhi gaadi ke achaanak palatney yaa kalabaji khaane kii surat main car kii chat sabase zyada damege hoti he kyonki aksar gadiyon kii chat lohe kii halki chadar se bani hoti he
 But after falling into the abyss of this car here, a girl lost her life, there was no damage to the roof of that car
 sutron kii maane to jis jagah par ye haadasa hone kii baat kahi gai, uske aas-paas koi aabaadi tak nahin he
 In such a situation, the theory of a sudden woman appearing is also under question
 sawaalon ke ghere main duriek sawaal yah bhi ki koi 322 kilometre kaa faasla jaldi puraa kar saktaa he yaa phir 593 kilometre kaa? jawaab yakeenan 322 kilometre hoga, lekin firozabad main amanmani or uski patni sara ke saath hue road accident ke baad lakhanu se chale sara ke gharavaale to baad main pahunche, gorakhpur se amanmani ke hamdard pehle pahunch gaye
 So is this also a coincidence? The distance from Lucknow to Firozabad is about 322 kilometers, while the journey time by road is about 5
 30 ghante
 The distance from Gorakhpur to Firozabad is about 593 km and the journey time by road is about 9
 11 ghante
 What is it to say that if Sara's family of Vallesara's family believe, a good convoy of Gorakhpur number i
e
 UP 53 trains had reached Ammani before they reached Firozabad
 aisa tabhi ho saktaa he, jab haadase kii khabar kisi ko vakt se pehle mil jaae or yakeenan ye hakeekat shaq to paidaa karata hi he
 Love marriage was done by Amanmani and Sara
 shuru main donon ke hi gharavaale isse naaraaz the, lekin sara ke gharavaalon ko tab doosraa jhatka laga jab unhen pataa chalaa ki unki jindagi main sabakuch thik nahin he
 Sara now wanted a divorce, but in the meantime decided to give her relationship another chance
 magar, ittefaq se yahi chance jaanaleva sabit hua
 The post-mortem report also raises suspicion as to what the post-mortem report of Qaysara is
 ab tak kii jaankaree ke mutabik sara kii maut kii vajah hamerej yani raktasrav or fefdon par chot kii vajah se hui he
 But many people, including householders, feel that there is no such thing as a lung injury in an accident
 jaahir he, sach jo bhi he, sawaalon ke ghere main he

 He said that the state government had changed the age-old reservation policy and implemented a new policy with a view to make maximum recruitment of people of Yadav society in the job

 udaarikaran ke baad ke bharat main jo mahatvapurn saamaajik badlaav aae hai unamem ek he kaamuktha ke bare main 'khulaapan'
 The word sexuality arouses resentment in some people, a feeling of acceptance in some
 or yah aaj ek katu vivaad kaa masala ban gaya he
 The biggest example of this conspiracy can be seen in the Delhi High Court, where homosexuality is being debated as a crime
 hamaari yon samskritiyaan bhi bhinn hanindia today-asi nilsan-oarji maarg ne 2008 main jo sex surveykshan karaayaa tha uske parinaam se paramparawaadi naitikta ke pairokaron ko kaaphi jhatka laga, lekin duusare logon ko yah jaanane kaa mauka bhi mila ki hamaari yon samskritiyaan bhi kitni bhinn hai
 Men and women of the four metros and seven major cities spoke about their sexual preferences and habits on condition of anonymity
 is surveykshan main paramparaagat varjanaaon main giravat or shaadi, ek patnitv tathaa vishamalangikta se pare kai tarah ke yon vyavhaar ke prati jhukaav kaa bhi pataa chalaa
 If assured not to reveal identity, then people are more willing to tell about their sex life
 mahila pornography nahin rahaa purushon kaa visheshadhikaarjaahir he, asaamaanya kaamuktha, vivahetar sambandh (durbhaagya se adhyayan main ise avaidh sambandh kaha gaya) or pornography (kaamuk sahitya aadi) jaise vishyon par varjana tuuti he
 Take pornography for example
 surveykshan ke mutabik, paanch main se teen purush or paanch main se ek mahila pornography ko 'maanya' maanati he
 Since pornography has always been considered a privilege of men, it is worth noting that 21 percent of the women (surveyed) considered pornography acceptable
 inamen se 45 fisadi ne isse younachaar ke maamle main kalpanasheel hone kii prerana lee
 Video is its most popular tool
 chitramay porn siries 'savita bhabhi'hyderabad main iskaa sabase adhik prachlan (68 fisadi) he, to kolkata duusare number (59 fisadi) par he
 It is also interesting to note here that one of the 25 women who watched pornography themselves agreed to make their own porn videos
 to mahilaayein na sirf porn dekh rahi hai balki iske nirmaan main hissaa bhi le rahi hai
 But this should not be assumed that these videos are intended for public distribution, but rather to capture intimate moments
 aaj home video logon ke jivan ke har hisse main pravesh kar gaye hai to yon jivan bhi apwaad nahin he
 Internet sexual exploits of a pictorial porn series 'savita Bhabhi' can be placed in the category of 'home porn'
 pornography par bahesaitihaasik drushti se to pornography par bahut bahes ho chuki he
 Traditional moralists and some feminist groups (though for very different reasons) have opposed pornography
 paramparaagat naitikta ke pairokaar ise sex ke prati sammohan maanate hai jiskaa younachaar ke mukhya uddeshy-santanopatti-se koi sarokaar nahin he
 These people view pornography (and extramarital affairs) as a threat to traditional family values
 nariwadiyon kaa maananaa he ki pashchimi deshon main pornography kaa itihaas vivaadaaspad rahaa he
 Anti-pornography feminists, called 'radical feminists', have called for censorship of pornography because it encourages rape and violence against women
 '80 or '90 ke dashak main ise catherine makinan or andria dworkin se samarthan mila jinke pornography par sensor ke jihad ko 'pornography siddhant he or balaatkaar us par amal' jaise naaron se prerana mili
 The fight against sexism, not sex, anti-feminist position, whose politics i agree with, distinguishes between sex-related speeches and open talk on sex
 jaise sex par khuli charchaa sexist (mahilaon ke prati bhedbhaav mulak) nahin hoti, vaise hi sabhi sexist charchaa kaamuk nahin ho sakati
 Therefore, sexism should be fought, not sex
 sensor virdohi nariwadi baar-baar un aankadon kii ore dhyaan aakarshith karte hai jinamein hinsa or pornography main koi sambandh najar nahin aata
 These include figures which are used by hardline feminists to support their views
 isaki pushti main ve 1987 ke ek adhyayan ko pesh karte hai jiskaa vishay tha-'kya pornography kaa kaarobaar karne waalon ko kadi sajaa di jaani chahie?' ham to aisa nahin maanate
 Rather, in our opinion, a sensible step should be to develop educational programs that teach the audience to use such mediums wisely
 bharat main pornography aam he lekin aam taur par isaki charchaa gupachup hi kii jaati he
 Any kind of public debate has a frenzied reaction to it
 1996 main film nirmaataa mahesh bhatta ne bayaan diya tha ki pornography dekhne ke icchhuk logon ko aisa karne kaa adhikaar he
 This provoked some social and women's organizations and demanded the removal of Bhatt from the governing council of FTII (pune)
 isi tarah kendriya film pramann board ke adhyaksh divangat film nirmaataa vijay anand ne bhi sujhav diya tha ki vayask filmein dikhaane ke liye alag theatre hone chahie, to unhen bhi is bayaan kii keemat apana istipha dekar chukaani padi thi
 The changing nature of homosexuality is said to be discussed and written about sex, which determines how sex is taken
 kaamuktha ko die gaye arth saamaajik drushti se maanya hote hai or dawaaon, manovigyaan, dharm, naitik sambandhon, kanoonon, saamaajik or saanskrithik rasm-rivaajon main kai tarah kii bhashaaon ke madhyam se gunthe hote hai
 The history of the language and movements of man's sexuality suggests that the recognition of one's own identity varies according to changing contexts
 misaal ke taur par vicitra yaa sandigdh kaamuktha kaa jatil itihaas rahaa he
 At first it emerged as a social stigma and private expression
