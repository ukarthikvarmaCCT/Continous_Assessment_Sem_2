 Thankfully, the train was not a victim of any accident and all the passengers in the train survived, otherwise a big accident could have happened
 yah ghatana us samay hui, jab train casinga kii ore ja rahi thi
 The reason for this incident is the non-installation of skid brake on the wheels of coaches by railway employees

 When the engine is removed from the train, it is mounted on the other side

 ghatana ke baad train ke dibbon ko lene ke liye shanivaar raat kareeb 11 baje titalgarh se ingine bheja gaya
 This incident happened because the railway line is downhill after Titlagarh
 isliye bina ingine ke hi train dhalaan kii disha main chalati rahi

 bhaajapa adhyaksh rajnath singh ne party kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi kii tarif karte hue unhen drudh patibaddhta vaala netaa bataaya
 Singh said that he sees only strength and talent in the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 singh ne yah bhi kaha ki yadhyapi 'ram mandir' kaa mudda adaalat main vichaaradhin he or logon ko usapar adaalat ke faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie, lekin agar yah sabit ho jaataa he ki muslim us khaas sthal (vivaadit sthal) par namaaj adaa karte the to vah sweekaar karenge ki ram mandir ke nirmaan ke prayaas jo chal rahe hai vah galat he
 Singh said, 'the strongest aspect of Narendra Modi is that he is a leader who is strongly committed and the transparency he has shown in governance after being Chief Minister for 12 years is admirable
 na sirf vikaas ke maamle main balki unhone gujarat ko ek adarsh rajya bana diya he
 ' unke kamjor pahaluon ke bare main puche jane par singh ne kaha ki yadhyapi ab tak unhone ek kaa bhi pataa nahin lagaaya he lekin vah dhundhane kaa prayaas karenge

 ise unki kamajori yaa majboot pahalu ke taur par dekha ja saktaa he
 ' jansabhaon main aitihaasik or aarthik tathyon ke sambandh main modi kii galatiyon ke bare main puche jane par singh ne kaha ki koi unka puraa bhaashan dekh saktaa he or unhone kabhi nahin kaha ki takshashila patna main tha
 Singh said, 'he (modi) did not say that Taxila was in Patna, one can see his entire speech
 aise samay aate hai jab in vyast dauron ke dauraan jabaan phisal sakati he
 It happens to us sometimes
 ' Asked about the Ram temple issue, Singh said that his party wants Ram temple to be built and as Hindus want temples to be built, people of other religions want their religious structure to be built
 singh ne kaha, 'maamla adaalat main vichaaradhin he or meraa maananaa he ki hamen adaalat ke faisle kaa intjaar karnaa chahie
 a bench of the Allahabad High Court has ruled that where the statue of Ram Lala is currently installed, it is the birthplace of Ram and all the three judges said this, but an appeal has been made in the Supreme Court against it and we Should wait
 ' Singh said, 'muslims used to offer namaz at the (disputed site) there, if it is proved then i will accept that the efforts going on to build the Ram temple are wrong
 ' gujarat main ek yuvati kii jasusi karne sambandhi vivaad ke bare main puche jane par singh ne kaha ki congress in sabake jariye bhaajapa ko jhatka nahin de sakati
 Singh said, 'such wrong tactics will be used to discredit the name of Narendra Modi
 lekin yah kisi bhi tareeke se party kii sehat ko prabhavit nahin karegaa
 And despite all this, Modi's popularity has not been affected
 ' On the question of how he, as the BJP president, is in sync with the alleged tussle between bjp's strongman Sushma Swaraj and party veteran Aran Jaitley, Singh said that the two leaders are 'very good friends'
 ' He said, 'sometimes there is a different opinion on an issue on the Central Parliamentary Board or any other forum and it comes out and the media says that there is a confrontation
 ' singh ne kaha, 'lekin alag-alag raay hona hamaari antarnihit takat he or jis bhi party main aantarik loktantr hoga usamen raay kii bhinnata hogi
 We are not a family party, we are a worker based party
 ' Asked who are 'saheb' in Amit Shah's alleged taped conversation, Singh said, 'in common parlance people speak Saab to another
 usee tarah ve sahabjade bhi kehete hai
 i come from a small village and when i was younger, it was said that he is Sahabzada
 main nahin maanata ki yah apmanjanak tippanee he
 ' unhone kaha ki agar unki party satta main lautati he to vah aarthik sankat kaa samaadhaan karne, samaan vikaas ko protsaahan dene or aay kii vishmata ko khatm karne or rojgaar pradaan karne kii disha main kaam karegi
 Singh said, 'unemployment is a big problem and we will try to solve it
 vaajapeyi ke chah vasho’ ke kaarykaal ke dauraan 6
 70 crore jobs were created whereas in the present government only 27 lakh jobs were created
 ' He said that the internal and external security crisis is also a challenge and the BJP will work on the diplomatic front as well
 singh ne kaha, 'vaajapeyi ke shasankaal ke dauraan unke kootnithik kaushal ke kaaran china ne sikkim par se apana daawa chhodane par sahmati jataa di thi lekin aaj waisi sthiti nahin he
 He said the BJP hopes to win four out of five states
 unhone kaha ki vah kisi ek vyakti ko shrey nahin denge balki khud ko chhodkar booth str ke kaaryakartaaon se lekar sheersh netaaon ko iskaa shrey denge
 Elections have been held recently in these five states
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa bhumandalikaran, udaarikaran or aadhunikeekaran ke khilaaf nahin he lekin vyakti ko satark rahanaa chahie or bharat kii arthvyavastha kii swaittata par koi sawaal nahin uthaaya janaa chahie

 isliye nahin ki yuvaraj cricketer hai
 But because he is an example for players
 chaahe wo khilaadi kisi bhi khel se judaa kyon naa ho or ab jab yuvaraj cancer ko haraakar kries par utarane ja rahe hai to sabane unhen shubhakamanaayen bhenji hai
 a player knows the joy and sorrow of a player most closely

 Everyone has realized that if Yuvraj's bet was reversed, there could have been a lot of trouble
 lekin pareshaaniyon ko peetate hue yuvaraj jab yahaan tak pahunch aaye to sab chaahate hai ki wo or kai nai misaalen kaayam karen
 It is also true that Hindustan is celebrating the return of the crown prince
 kal wo or shiddat se unhen salaam thonkega

 lalit modi vivaad main fansi videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ke liye agle hafte shuru hone vaala monsoon satr raahat bharaa ho saktaa he
 non-congress parties have informally decided not to speak against Sushma in the upcoming Parliament session
 yani lalit modi maamle main vipaksh kii koshish rahegi ki sarkaar ko to gheraa jaae lekin sushamaa par nishaanaa saadhane se bachein
 By the way, apart from Sushma, the Chief Minister of Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje has also come under siege on this issue
 enditivi ko vishwasaneey sutron ke hawaale se pataa chalaa he ki trinmul congress, ensipi, jediu or samaajawaadee party ne phone par baatcheet karke "sushamaa-ke-khilaaf-naa-bolne" kaa samjhauta kar liya he
 According to a former Union Minister "we have discussed our strategy for this session and we think Sushmaji is a good woman
 unka vyavhaar hameshaa acha or sahi rahaa he
 We all have good relations with them so we will not stand against them nor shout slogans
 " At the same time, the Congress alleges that Sushma Swaraj has helped Lalit Modi in obtaining the documents for the UK visit and hence he should resign
 haalanki pichley maheene uthe is vivaad par congress ke alaava baaki ke vipaksh dalon ke bheetar bahut zyada akramak ravaiya nazar nahin aa rahaa
 For example, when Trinamool Congress MP Saugato Roy criticized Swaraj, the party made it clear in a tweet that it was Roy's 'personal opinion'
 isi tarah jab ensipi ke saansad deepi treepathi ne swaraj ke khilaaf apni baat kahi to party chif sharad pavaar ne unhen 'chup' rahane kii salaah de daali
 The comments is mudde par sushamaa swaraj apana bachaav karte hue kahati ai hai ki unhone maanviya aadhaar par lalit modi kii madad kii thi taaki vah portugal main apni biimaar patni se milane ja saken
 So is this answer enough for the opposition? Says a politician "his attitude has always been good
 haa, ye vivaad kaaphi durbhagyapurna rahaa lekin ek baat saaf he ki ham unke istife kii maang nahin karne vaale
 " ye baat alag he ki vipaksh kaa ye naram ravaiya vasundhara raaje ke liye nahin he jinka naam bhi is maamle main fansaa hua he
 According to one source, like Swaraj, Raje does not get along much with other parties

 NDTV has been quoted by reliable sources as saying that the Trinamool Congress, NCP, JDU and Samajwadi Party have reached an agreement to "speak for Sushma-against-no-talk" over phone
 ek purv kendriya mantri ke mutabik "hamane is satr ke liye apni ranneeti par charchaa kii he or hamen lagata he ki sushamaji ek acchhee mahila hai
 His behavior has always been good and right
 ham sabake saath unke achche sambandh hai isliye naa ham unke khilaaf khadey honge or naa hi naare lagaayenge
 " vahiin congress kaa aarope he ki sushamaa swaraj ne britain yatra ke liye dastauez hasil karne main lalit modi kii madad kii he or isliye unhen istipha dena chahie
 However, there is not much aggressive attitude within the opposition parties other than Congress on this dispute that arose last month
 jaise ki jab trinmul congress ke saasand saugato roy ne swaraj kii aalochana kii tab ek twit ke jariye party ne saaf kar diya ki ye roy kii 'vyaktigat raay' he
 Similarly, when NCP MP DP Tripathi spoke against Swaraj, party chief Sharad Pawar advised him to be 'silent'
 tippaniyan Sushma Swaraj has defended herself on this issue, saying that she had helped Lalit Modi on humanitarian grounds so that he could visit his ailing wife in Portugal
 to kya vipaksh ke liye ye jawaab kaaphi he? ek rajaneta kehete hai "unka ravaiya hameshaa se acha hi rahaa he
 Yes, this dispute has been quite unfortunate but one thing is clear that we are not going to demand his resignation
 " It is a different matter that this soft attitude of the opposition is not for Vasundhara Raje, whose name is also implicated in this case

 About 10 months ago, another officer of the corporation also committed suicide due to professional pressure
 is maamle main cese darj karke police jaanch kar rahi he
 Police in-charge SS Kushwaha said that Sunil Rewal, the chief cleaning inspector in-charge of Saket Nagar zone of the Municipal Corporation, consumed poison in his house in the hostess city
 unhen najdiki aspataal le jaaya gaya, lekin unki jaan nahin bachaai ja saki
 He said that a preliminary investigation by the police has revealed that Reval was troubled by the pressure of work for the last few days
 aatmahatyaase pehle chode patr main bhi unhone likhaa ki kaam ke baari dabaav ne unhen ucch raktchaap jaisi bimariyon kaa marij bana diya he
 Let it be said that Naharlani, a sub-engineer of the Municipal Corporation, also gave his life by hanging in his house in Hira Nagar area on 30 August
 is maamle main police ne purv parshad bahadur verma or ejeeniyar enes tomars sahit paanch logon ke khilaaf cese darj kiya tha
 On the Masrat Alam case, Prime Minister Narendra Modi bowed to the overwhelming demand of the opposition that there was no ban on terrorism and separatism
 is maamle main sadan ke aakrosh ke saath hum
 i assure the House and the country that whatever activities are happening after the formation of the government, they are not being done in consultation with the Government of India, nor by giving information
 rajya main ho rahe faislon main hamaari sahmati nahin he
 The PM also said that the wrong message should not be known in the world regarding the unity of the country
 kripaya karke hamen deshbhakti na sikhaaen
 We have sought clarification from the state government
 rajya se is sambandh se spashtikaran aane ke baad sadan ko jaankaree di jaaegi
 Steps will be taken in the limits of the constitution
 isse purv grahamantri rajnath singh ne kaha, is sadan ke kai saansadon ne algaavvaadi netaa masarrat alam kii rihaai par chintaa vyakt kii he
 i want to assure the House that our government will not compromise on civil security
 is masale par sansad main bayaan diya ki unhone bataaya ki jammu kashmir sarkaar ne jo report bheji he us par kendra ne spashtikaran maanga he
 But the opposition is not happy with the government's statement
 loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne kaha ki agar pradhanmantri chaahate hai ki sansad main is mudde par ek raay ho to wo jammu-kashmir sarkaar se alag kyon nahin ho jate
 Later Congress also did a walkout darasal, aaj loksabhaa kii kaarywahi shuru hote hi mallikarjun khadge ne spikar se sthagan prastaav swikaarne kii apil karte hue kaha ki siem mufti mohammad said ne akele ye faisalaa nahin kiya hoga
 Referring to the BJP-PDP coalition government in the state, Kharge said that the Mufti must have talked to the PM
 bijepi masarrat alam rihaai par khud ko dur rakhana chaahati he isliye sansadeey kaarymantri venkaiya naidu ne is mudde ko rashtriya chintaa kaa bataate hue bijepi ko bhi isse joda
 Despite the pm's statement, the opposition continued to create chaos and the Congress walked out of the House on the issue
 gauratlab he ki kattarpanthi hurriyat algaavaadi netaa masarrat alam kii rihaai isiilie hui he, kyonki uskaa ditension order jammu-kashmir sarkaar ne sin nahin kiya tha
 After all, who wants to complicate the investigation of Bollywood actress Zia Khan's suicide case? Now a sensational truth related to this case has come to the fore, which has made the police think about this question
 kyonki jiya khan ke ghar se or uske bwoyfriend suraj pancholi ke ghar se baraamad jiya ke likhe tathakthith khaton kii handrintig mail nahin kha rahi he
 In such a situation, the question is whether the people of Jia's house are lying or the 'game' has happened somewhere in Suraj's house? Is the last letter recovered from Jia's house a liar? Or are the love letters from Suraj's house wrong? After all, why Jia is not getting handwriting? Who is the one who wants to complicate the case? This is the new screw that has now surfaced in the case of suicide of Bollywood actress Jia Khan
 vaise to is pench ke kai myne ho sakate hai, lekin iskaa sabase bada or ahm matlab yahi he ki koi aisa jarur he, jo jiya khan kii khudakushi ke maamle kii tafteesh ko patari se utaarna chahta he
 Who is he after? Actually, three days after Zia Khan's suicide, his family handed over the six-page letter he had received from Jia's room to the police, stating that Jia's letter was handwriting and that of Suraj's house
 The handwriting of five of her Jia's love letters does not match each other
 aise main ek sidhaa sa sawaal yahi he ki aakhir kiskaa daawa galat he? kya jiya khan ke gharavaalon ne police ko jo khat diya hai, wo jiya kaa nahin, kisi or kaa likhaa he? yaa phir suraj ke ghar se jo lav latters baraamad hue hai, wo galat hai?aapako yaad hoga ki jiya ke gharavaalon ne is khat ko apane ghar se tab milane kii baat kahi thi, jab unhone jiya kii last prere meeting ke dauraan jiya kii likhi koi kavita logon ke sunaane ke liye uske purse kii talaashi lee
 He told that then this six-page letter was handed over to Jiah's sister, which Jiya had written for Suraj, and in this she had mentioned about the excesses of Suraj as well as committing suicide
 alabatta is chitthee main naa to upar suraj kaa naam tha or naa hi neeche jiya kaa
 It is another matter that then the police arrested Suraj Pancholi, his boyfriend on the same letter
 baad main suraj ko lekar jab police uske ghar par dabish dene pahunchi, to vahaan se police ko jiya ke likhe paanch lav letters mili, jo jiya ne kathith taur par suraj ke liye likhe the
 To get the investigation of the case done, it was necessary to check the handwriting of Jia's last letter as much as it was necessary to check the handwriting of her love-latters
 lekin abhi jaanch se pehle hi sarsari taur par donon ke handriting nahin milane kii baat saamne aa gai he
 Because the handwriting in the letter from Jia's house is standing, while the handwriting in the letters found from Suraj's house cropped up
 thik isi tarah police sutron kii maane to donon khaton main angreji kaa letters 'ai' bhi alag-alag tareeke se likhaa gaya he
 While the word 'love' is also quite different in texture
 vaise police ko shaq isliye bhi zyada he, kyonki khudakushi ke baad use jiya ke ghar se aisa koi khat nahin mila tha
 While the policemen who arrived on the occasion claimed that they had conducted a thorough search of Jia's house
 haalanki iskaa matlab ye katai nahin he ki jiya ke ghar ke log galat hai
 But it is so sure that till the handwriting of different accounts from the two houses match with something else written by Jia, then the matter of the mist will definitely remain
 or is maamle kii tafteesh donon main kisi bhi khat ke galat pataa chalane par nae tareeke se aage badhegi
 On the other hand, if a newspaper is to be believed, after Jia's suicide, the meeting of Jia's mother Rabia Khan and Sooraj's mother Zarina Wahab was not very good
 badalte halaat ke bich jarina, jab raabia se milane gai thim to vahaan raabia ke jarina se kaha ki unka betaa suraj jiya ke laayak nahin tha, to phir jarina ne bhi palat kar jawaab diya ki unka kahana bilkul sahi he, kyonki jiya ko koi or zyada maior or tarjubekar insaan kii jarur thi
 Zarina said that Jiya loved Suraj very much and Suraj also took care of her in his own way
 jiya khan ne khudakushi isliye kii, kyonki uskaa bwoyfriend suraj pancholi usase peechha chhudaana chahta tha
 This is revealed by Jia's mother Rabia Khan in her statement which she gave to the police after Jia's death
 ajtak ke paas maujuud raabia khan ke isi bayaan kii exclusive copy main jiya kii jindagi se judi or bhi kai aisi baaten darj hai, jinhen jaanakar aap chaunk jaaenge
 Did Suraj want to get rid of Jia? What is the truth of Jia and Suraj's relationship? What did Sooraj say to Jia's mother before Jia's suicide? The truth of Rabia Khan's statement
 
 
 'jiya to suraj ko beintahaa chaahati thi, lekin suraj tha ki lagaataar jiya ke saath badasluki kar rahaa tha or ab to uskaa sara dhyaan jiya se hat kar apane kariyar par thahar gaya tha, jabaki jiya pehle kii tarah suraj ke liye hi ji rahi thi
 
 
 And just that, it broke Jia so much that Jia committed suicide
 'kuch aisa hi he jiya khan kii maa raabia khan kaa wo bayaan, jisaki binah par police ne jiya ke khudakushi ke baad uske bwoyfrand suraj pancholi ke khilaaf use khudakushi ke liye majaboor karne kaa mukadmaa darj kiya he
 In this statement present with Aaj Tak, Rabia Khan has told the police how Jiah Khan and Suraj were extremely close to each other for the last one year, but in recent times Suraj was trying to get rid of her
 raabia kii maane to vaise suraj jiya se peechha chhudaane kii pehle se hi koshish kar rahaa tha
 But on May 18, when Jiah went to Suraj's house and Suraj secretly went to meet Jiya's mother Rabia Khan, she realized this
 raabia khan ke bayaan ke mutabik iske baad unhen is baat kaa yakeen ho gaya ki suraj jiya ke saath ab syrius nahin he
 Referring to this incident, Rabia Khan has said in her statement, 'on May 18 morning, at half past eight, Jia left the bag to go somewhere
 saadhe das baje suraj kaa mere paas phone aayaa ki kya main aapse milane aa saktaa hum? mere haa kehane par wo mere ghar laal rang kii jogging suut main aayaa or poocha, kya aapako pataa he, jiya kahaan he? maine kaha ki wo ek event par gai he or mande ko waapas aa jaaegi
 But then Suraj told that Jia's flight has missed and she is at his (suraj's) house
 is par maine kaha ki to kya hua? tum to ek duusare se bahut pyaar karte ho? lekin iske baad suraj rone laga or usne kaha ki bachapan se usne apane maa-baap ko ladate jhagadate dekha he
 He has seen his father go into depression due to lack of work
 wo apane pitaaji se bahut nafrat karata he, kyonki uske pita ne uski maa se bahut bura bartaav kiya
 i asked him what he wanted to say
 So Suraj said that when his work starts, he will not be able to give time to Jia
 'raabia khan ke mutabik us roj unhone suraj ko apni taraf se samajhane kii puri koshish kii, lekin jab unhen suraj ke iraadon kaa ahsaas ho gaya to unhone suraj se kaha ki unhen ye lagata he ki uskaa focus ab jiya se hat kar apane kariyar kii taraf ho gaya he, jabaki jiya kaa focus usee kii taraf he
 But Suraj's conversation with Jiah Khan's mother was not over yet and Rabia was shocked after hearing what he told her
 idhar, jiya kii maa ne suraj ko esemes kiya ki wo unki jindagi se khelnaa chhod de or udhar, jiya kii laash ke saamne suraj ke pita ne apane bete ko gaaliyaan deen
 What was going on between Khan and the Pancholi family? jiya kii maa raabia khan ke bayaan main har sawaal kaa jawaab he
 Rabia Khan has told in his statement to the police that his daughter Zia had tried suicide once before and it was not anyone else but Jia's boyfriend Suraj who came to know about it
 raabia ne kaha he ki jis roj jiya ko apane ghar main chhod kar suraj unase milane pahunchaa tha, usee roj suraj ne unhen bataaya ki jiya ne ek roj apana haath kaat liya tha
 Rabia says that she then asked Suraj the reason for this and Suraj himself told that Jia loves her more than her work
 raabia ke mutabik unhone tab suraj ko bataaya ki is halaat ke liye pachaas fisadi jimmedaari uski bhi he
 Rabia has told that after this he also talked to his daughter and he realized that Suraj is distancing from Jia
 lihaaja, 28 may ko unhone khud suraj ko ek esemes likhaa,'tum ham logon ke saath khel khelnaa chhod do
 
 
 To this he replied, 'you are confusing both of us
 
 
 'raabia kaa kahana he ki us roj usne suraj ko palat kar ek or esemes kiya,'meri beti ko apane bare main khul kar sochane do
 After this, when you are with him, you will again withdraw from your focus and disturb your parents
 ab shanti rahane do
 
 
 i haven't said anything about it in the past year, but now i understand everything
 agar tum uske dhyaan main rahe, to uski jindagi barbaad ho jaaegi
 
 
 According to Rabia, Sooraj did not reply to this SMS then, but he did SMS once again and told him about love, marriage and home
 or jab unhen is baat kaa pataa chalaa to unhone jiya ko saavdhaan rahane kii salaah di
 Then on May 3, the day of Jia's suicide, she came out of her house with Jia
 jiya apane bhai faijan ke ghar gayi, jabaki raabia apni saheli anju mahendru ke ghar
 Where at night Suraj's father Aditya Pancholi also came with one of his girlfriends and Rabia did not like this and she left for her house
 lekin ghar aakar unhone dekha ki jiya ne khudakushi kar lee he
 On receiving the news, both Anju and Aditya reached her house
 lekin aditya pancholi ne vahiin par kaha, 'mere bete ne apane kariyar kii wat laga di
 Go to your career now 
 
 'raabia ke mutabik baad main unhen jiya kii ek dost se pataa chalaa ki jiya suraj se pregnant bhi thi or usne aborshan bhi karavaaya tha
 However, in this statement, Rabia has also mentioned the good days between the two and told how Suraj took them to dinner twice and expressed his love to Jia
 lekin baad main halaat badal gaye
 After all, what was it that drove Suraj away from Jia? or jab jiya kaa dil tutaa to usne suraj ke liye kya likhaa? jiya ke kamare se mili uske aakhri khat main, donon ke rishte kii puri hakeekat darj he
 Believe this letter, Jia Khan was killed not by career failure, but by failure of love
 'main nahin jaanati ki ye baat tumse kaise kahuun lekin main kah sakati hum ki ab mere paas khone ko kuch bhi nahin
 i have already lost everything
 jab tak tum ye pard rahe hoge, ho saktaa he main usase pehle hi duniya se vidaa ho chuki houngi
 
 
 i am broken inside
 maine tumse pyaar kiya or badale main mujhe rusavaai mili
 You persecuted me everyday
 mere saare khwab tod die
 i don't want to live anymore
 
 
 'ye majamoon he, bollywood kii dilkash adaakara jiya khan ke us aakiri khat kaa, jisaki badaulat mumbai police ne somvaar ko jiya ke bwoyfrand or actor aditya pancholi ke bete suraj pancholi ko giraftaar kar liya
 In this letter, Jia not only complains to her boyfriend, but accuses him of being unfaithful, but also tells of how his boyfriend cheated and beat him up
 jiya ne is khat main aage likhaa he kis tarah usne apane bwoyfrand ko apana sabakuch saunp diya or bwoyfrand uski bhaawanaaon se kheltaa rahaa
 'visiting Goa was my birthday present, yet you cheated
 maine garbhpaat karaayaa
 You ruined my Christmas and my birthday dinner, while i tried my best to make your birthday special
 tumhaari taraf se main apane liye pyaar or samarpan nahin dekhati hum
 i am afraid that you will hurt me mentally and physically
 tumhaari jindagi sirf party or ladakiyon tak simit he jabaki meri jindagi tum or meraa kaam the
 If i live here, i will miss you, so i am saying goodbye to 10 years of film career and dreams
 
 
 'philhal, police ne is khat kii binah par aditya pancholi ke bete suraj ke khilaaf ipisi kii dhara 306 ke tahat khudakushi ke liye uksaane kaa mukadmaa darj kiya he
 At the same time, it is also investigating whether this handwriting is of Jia's own or not

 The train stops at Sheen station for a while
 train jab chalane vaali hoti he to bhigi hui sari main kuch chapal swabhaav vaali mahilaayein jhpatkar train main ghus aati hai or thik mere bagal vaali siton par aakar baith jaati hai
 They are laughing and talking to each other about how they ran and caught the train, which was about to miss

 a girl older than me joins their conversation all year long
 teenon aapas main baat karte hue khub hansi-thitholi karne lagati hai
 On coming to Byculla station, a girl sitting with him meets me
 vah angreji main puuchhati he, ''kya aap bhartiya hai
 "this is the question i often encounter
 main unhen bataati hum, ''main mumbai se hum
 Don't you know that wearing such clothes is not allowed in the train
 '' main tajjub se kahati hum, ''kya sachmuch
 Where is it written? '' main jaan-bujhkar train kii deevaaron main is tarah najar daalati hum, jaise yah dekhne kii koshish kar rahi hum ki kahin khaas kism ke kapade pahanane kii manaahi karte hue laal rang kaa cross lagaaya gaya ho
 Just then, two other women in Marathi make fats, which means unconscious and prostitute
 agar maine yahaan paanch saal college kii padhai karte hue local train ke dwitiya shrenee vaale mahilaon ke dibbe main safar na kiya hota to main yahi samajhti ki maine aisi dress pahanakar koi bahut badi galati kar di he
 She was constantly expressing her anger against me
 ve samaj rahi thim ki main unki bhashaa nahin samaj rahi hum, kyonki main angreji kii kitaab pard rahi thi or alag kism ke kapade hue thi
 But when his words got out of tolerance, i said in Hindi to an aunt sitting to my right that i understand Marathi
 phir ve hindi main bolte hue mujhase kehane lageen ki main kaise bhartiya samskruti ke khilaaf ja rahi hum, is tarah ang pradarshan vaale kapade pahanakar kaise safar kar rahi hum, kaise mujhe is baat kii jaraa-si bhi chintaa nahin he ki log mujhe ghur rahe hai
 This is a very strange situation
 mumbai kii local train main lambey samay se safar karte hue maine yah sikh liya he ki chup rahanaa hi behatar he
 If i say one word in English, then she will clearly say that i should travel in first class
 lekin mere paas pratham shrenee kaa tikat kharidne ke liye paise nahin hai
 i tell those women, "have i interfered in your conversation?" main aapako pareshaan to nahin kar rahi hum

 i mentioned this incident on Facebook and was amazed to find a lot of reactions from male friends, who accused me of being classist, as i was unable to mingle with Marathi-speaking women
 maine is vishay par jitna adhik sochaa, utana hi mujhe laga ki is ghatana kaa kisi varg yaa bhashaa se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin he
 It is a matter of straightforward ideology and how some of us have embraced in the hug assimilated what qualities a good Indian girl should have

 ja mend di gap jaise andolanon ke rup main vyakt ho rahi he
 There is no need to declare yourself a feminist to be a part of this new movement
 darasal, mujhe puraa yakeen he ki isaki ghor samarthak ve mahilaayein hai jo kisi saamaajik or paariwarik reeti-rivaajon kii chintaa kiye bagaiyr apane dhang se jiti hai
 They own their will and are not ready to succumb to the stereotypes of society
 ve nari hone ke jaivik kaarnon se kisi bhi tarah majaboor nahin hai, jo har tarah kii lajja se mukt hai
 She considers herself strong, not abla, as a woman
 ho saktaa he aisi mahilaon kii sankhya abhi kam ho, lekin ve mahatvapurn alpsankhyak hai, kyonki tamaam virodhon ke baavjood ve apana bhavishya apane haathon se tay kar rahi hai

 ve apni soch ke jariye nariwadi andolan ko nai oonchaaiyon par le ja rahi hai or mahila ke liye samanta ke adhikaar or apane anand ke adhikaar ke bich ek atoot rishta kaayam kar rahi hai
 It is not a class struggle and certainly not limited to just the English-speaking world
 yah sabhi virgon ke bich dekha ja saktaa he,jahaan mahilaayein is tarah kaa vidroh kar rahi hai or shiksha kaa adhikaar, kaam kaa adhikaar, jivan saathi chunane kaa adhikaar maang rahi hai, bhale hi mata-pita dwaara tay kii jane vaali shaadi hi kyon na ho
 Post-modern Indian women are interfering in areas in which they were afraid to step in

 She is not afraid of being clumsy in the kitchen, nor is she afraid of cooking delicious food, she does not even talk about becoming a mother or not

 ) Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the successful captain of Team India and IPL, is battling on many levels these days
 pehle rising pune superjyant team ke prabandhan ne unhen 'boodha' bataate hue team kii captaini se hataakar unki jagah australia ke captain steve smith ko captain bana diya
 Then even his bat did not work
 haalanki unhone pichley dinon ek shandaar pari se apana purana rup dikhaaya or bataaya ki unamem ab bhi dam he
 Dhoni may not be worth it in the eyes of the owners, but cricket experts understand his importance
 tabhi to nae captain steve smith dhoni kii salaah ke bina ek kadam aage nahin bad paa rahe
 Proof of this has also come out in a video recently, in which Smith is seen running and getting advice from Dhoni
 steve smith vaise to match main kai baar dhoni se salaah lete dikh jate hai, lekin taaja maamla mumbai indians ke khilaaf hue match main saamana aayaa, jab pari ke aakhri over main smith dhoni se salaah lete dikhe
 Significantly, in this match, Pune won thrillingly by three runs
 tippaniyan In this video it can be clearly seen how Smith goes to Dhoni for advice and then Ajinkya Rahane also reaches there
 gauratlab he ki dhoni ko kai baar aise ahm maukon par apni captaini se haare hue match ko team india kii jholii main daalate hue ham sab dekh chuke hai
 Later Ajinkya Rahane had told that in the last over, there was a discussion between Smith, me and Mahi Bhai about who should be given this over from Thakur and Jaydev Unadkat
 aise main hamen laga ki aakhri over main teji se gend na daali jaae or hamane unadakat se hi antim over karaayaa
 Jaydev's speed is somewhat lower than that of Thakur
 saath hi unki slor ball bhi kaaphi kargar he
 'significantly, in this match, Pune had succeeded in defeating Mumbai Indians by three runs
 yah match mumbai ke vankhede stadium main khelaa gaya
 Although Steve Smith is seen taking advice from Dhoni many times in the match, but the latest case was faced in the match against Mumbai Indians, when in the last over of the innings, Smith was seen taking advice from Dhoni
 gauratlab he ki is match main pune ne romaanchak tareeke se teen ran se jeet hasil kii thi
 The comments is video main safataur par dekha ja saktaa he ki kaise smith salaah lene ke liye dhoni kii ore jate hai or phir ajinkya rahane bhi vahaan pahunch jate hai
 It is worth noting that we have seen Dhoni on many important occasions, losing his match under his captaincy, in the bag of Team India
 baad main ajinkya rahane ne bataaya tha ki aakhri over main smith, mujhamen or maahi bhai main is baat ko lekar charchaa hui ki ye over thakur or jayadev unadakat main se kise diya jaae
 In such a situation, we felt that the ball was not bowled fast in the last over and we got the last over from Unadkat
 jayadev kii raftaar thakur kii tulana main kuch had tak kam he
 Also, his slow ball is also very effective
 ' gauratlab he ki is match main pune ne mumbai indians ko teen ran se haraane main safalataa hasil kii thi

 Chidambaram and the police also said that the cause of the incident could be mutual enmity but 54-year-old Ravi Shankar dismissed the assessment as baseless

 The Home Minister said that an oral report has been received in the case of the incident but a written communication is also awaited
 unhone kaha, ‘isamen unke do anuyaayiyon ke bich vivaad dikhaai detaa he
 One of them was injured but out of danger

 The first land acquisition bill in India came in 1894
 yah kanoon angrejon ne banaaya tha isliye jaahir taur par behad gairbarabar or shoshankari tha
 This law was changed in 2014 after 120 years
 NDA sarkaar ab is vidheyak main badlaav karnaa chaahati he jis par anna se lekar vipaksh hangaamaa barapaane ko taiyaar he
 Know what is happening in the land acquisition bill and why it is being opposed
 kheti yogya bahu-fasali jameen adhigrahan nahinjameen ke adhigrahan or punarvaas ke maamalon main sarkaar aise bhoomi adhigrahan par vichaar nahin karegi jo yaa to nijee pariyojnaon ke liye nijee companiyaan karnaa chahengi yaa phir jinamein saarvajanik pariyojnaon ke liye bahu-fasali jameen leni pade
 If the law is made, then if this bill becomes law then multi-cropped irrigated land will not be acquired
 jinaki jameen jaaegi unako kya milegamsaude main jameen ke maalikon or jameen par ashriton ke liye ek vistrut punarvaas package kaa zikr he
 It also includes landless people whose livelihood runs from the acquired land
 is bich, adhigrahan ke kaaran jeevika khone waalon ko 12 maheene ke liye prati parivaar teen hajaar rupye prati maah jivan nirvaah bhatta die jane kaa praavdhaan he
 The case of litigation has made the most significant change in the UPA government's bill on land acquisition with a retrospective clause
 2013 ke kanoon main yah vyavastha kii gai thi ki agar kisi jameen ke adhigrahan ko kaagajon par 5 saal ho gaye hai, sarkaar ke paas jameen kaa kabja nahin he or muawza nahin diya gaya, to mul maalik jameen ko waapas maang saktaa he
 But now the government has added to this provision that if the case has gone to court, then the time of litigation will not be added to the 5-year period
 paanch saal kii shart hataisarkaar ne jameen par paanch saal ke bheetar kaam shuru karne kii shart bhi hataa lee he
 After taking the land under the old bill, companies were required to start work on it within five years
 lekin ab ye pabandi hataa lee gai he
 In the old bill, there was a provision that if the work is not started within five years, the land owners can claim it again
 muaavje kii paribhaasha badlisarkaar ne retrospective cloj ke tahat muaavje kii paribhaasha ko bhi badal diya he
 According to the old bill, if the compensation received by the person concerned has not gone to his account and the government has deposited the compensation in the court or government account, then it will be considered as compensation
 javabdehi praavdhaan main dheelendie sarkaar ne kanoonee kii andekhi karne or kanoon todane vaale adhikariyon ke khilaaf kadam uthaane ke liye rakhe gaye praavdhaan bhi deele kiye hai
 According to the new change in the bill, now it will be necessary to take permission of the concerned department to act on an officer
 yani afasar saaf batch niklenge
 Consent not necessarily an important provision in the 2013 bill was the consent of the people
 iske tahat sarkaar or nijee companiyon ke saajha project main 80 fisadi jameen maalikon kii sahmati jaruri thi
 Whereas if the project is fully government, then 70 percent owner approval was required for it
 lekin nae kanoon main ise khatm kar diya gaya he
 Land acquisition will be done: The way the central government has issued a new ordinance, it is clear that no matter what the land owner wants, the land will be acquired
 agar wo muaavja lene se inkaar karata he to ise sarkari khajaane main jamaa kar jameen maalik ko bhoomi swami ko uski bhoomi se bedakhal kiya ja sakegaa

 6 % bhartiyabharatiyon main ghat rahi democrat ke prati lokapriyatapradhanmantri narendra modi ravivaar ko america ke texas rajya ke huston shahar main 50,000 bhartiya-americanyon ko sambodhit karenge
 This time his program will also include President of the US and Republican Party leader Donald Trump
 ek taraf jahaan texas main hone vaale is kaarykram se bharat-america ke rishton main or majbootee kii ummiden kii ja rahi hai to vahiin raajnneetik lihaaj se bhi is kaarykram ko mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) of India Today assessed the 2016 US elections and found that indian-americans did not vote for Trump in the elections
 bhartiya americanyon kii aabadmerican community survey 2017 ke anusaar america main lagbhag 40 lakh bhartiya-america hai jo unki jansankhya kaa 1
 3 percent make up
 agar sirf aabaadi ke hisaab se dekha jaae to sabase badi sankhya main california main 7
 3 lakh Indians live American
 california ke baad aata he neuyork, jahaan 3
 There are 7 lakh Indians
 uske baad aata he new jersey (3
 7 Lakh), Texas (3
 5 lakh), elenois (2
 3 lakhs) and Florida (1
 5 lakh)
 Of the 50 states in the US, 16 were states where Indian Americans had more than 1 percent of the population
 fisadi ke hisaab se dekhen to new jersey main bhartiya-americanyon kaa pratishat sabase zyada tha
 4 in New Jersey
 1 pratishat aabaadi bhartiya-americanyon kii thi
 New Jersey is followed by Rhode Island, New York, Illinois California, and Delaware, with the largest percentage of Indian population
 zyaadaatar bhartiya-america democrat shasit pradeshon menve 16 rajya jahaan bhartiya americanyon kii sankhya 1 pratishat se zyada thi, unamem se 10 rajyon ke nagarikon ne 2016 ke raashtrapati chunaav main donald trump kii virdohi hillari clinton ko vot diya tha or sirf 6 rajyon ne hi donald trump ko samarthan diya
 DIU studied two surveys to understand the voting pattern of Indians living in the US
 pehla UPI / cvoter or doosraa 2016 ke chunaav ke pehle asian america saamudayik survey (NAAS)
 In both surveys, it became clear that indian-americans overwhelmingly supported Clinton's party (democrat), not Trump
 hillari ke paksh main rahe 57
 a 6% Indian UPI / cvoter's survey found that 57
 6 pratishat bharatiyon ne hillari clinton ko raashtrapati banane ke liye vot diya or lagbhag 29 pratishat ne trump ko
 The survey also found that Indian Americans collectively tended to be less vulnerable to Clinton than the rest of the minority
 sirf 57
 6 percent of Indian Americans supported Clinton, while nearly 90 percent of african-americans supported Clinton
 clinton ko 75
 3 percent of Hispanic and 72 percent of other Asian voters supported
 NAAS survey main kuch or hi paaya gaya
 According to the NAAS survey, 77 percent of indian-americans supported Hillary Clinton and Trump was supported by only 16 percent of indian-americans
 NAAS survey ne yah bhi bataaya ki 31 pratishat bhartiya-america apane aap ko kattar democrat maanate the, to vahiin apane aap ko kattar republican (yaa trump saporter) maanane waalon kii sankhya maatr 4 pratishat hi thi
 Unity in unity, where there was a large number of indian-americans, they were divided over votes in elections
 sabase zyada bhartiya-americanyon vaale new jersey ke bhartiya voter kaaphi had tak bante hue the
 53 in New Jersey
 7 pratishat bhartiya-americanyon ne clinton ko samarthan diya, vahiin 25
 2 percent supported Trump
 16 pratishat bhartiya-americanyon ne anya ummidavaaron ko samarthan diya or 4
 9 percent gave no opinion
 new york main bhi kuch aisa hi dekhne ko mila
 The Indians who supported Trump and Clinton were divided into 2 parts
 yahaan tak ki texas main bhi, jahaan trump or modi mil rahe hai
 62
 5 pratishat bhartiya-americanyon ne clinton kaa saath diya, 18
 8 percent trump and 18
 7 pratishat ne anya ko samarthan diya
 What do experts say? Nilanjan Sarkar, senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research, believes that indian-american voters mostly support the Democrat Party
 nilanjan yah bhi bataate hai ki trump or modi kii texas main hone vaali yah mulaakaat shaayad hi sthiti badal paae
 Says Neelanjan, "recently published research by Sanjoy Chakraborty, Devesh Kapoor and Nirvikar Singh has shown that indian-americans mostly support the Democrat Party
 america ke zyaadaatar dhani voter republican party ko vot dete hai, lekin bhartiya-america, jo vahaan par sabase dhanwaan samudaayon main se ek hai, democrat party ko hi samarthan dete hai
 "" The meeting between Modi and Trump is crucial for strengthening indo-us relations, increasing business and diplomatic matters, but may not be as effective in converting voters there
 aisa isliye kyonki bharat ke vipareet america ke voter apni party ko lekar kaaphi kattar hai
 "cvoter founder Yashwant Deshmukh believes that this meeting of Trump and Modi can be very successful in wooing Indian voters
 deshmukh kehete hai, "america main rah rahe bhartiya votaron par meri yahi raay he ki ve koi alag-thalag voter nahin hai
 Well, they have supported the Democrat Party in large numbers, but they do not necessarily stick to the same party as ordinary American voters do
 purvi or pashchimi taton par kendrit bhartiya-america zyaadaatar democrat shasit pradeshon main rahete hai
 "'popularity of Democrats in Indians' Deshmukh also spoke about the declining popularity of Democrats in the Indian community
 "democrat party kii taraf se tikat lene kii hode main jute ummidavaar modi kii aalochana karte hai or unke haal hi main die gaye kashmir par bayanon se bhartiya samudaay itnaa khush nahin he
 Another thing is that Indians living in America do not vote for candidates from their own communities, nor do indian-american candidates make any effort to woo Indian voters
 "deshmukh kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki modi or trump kii yah mulaakaat bhartiya votaron kaa rukh badal sakati he, thik vaise hi jaise britain main hua tha
 He said, "cameron was winning the 2015 election but he knew that the Labor Party had the support of Indian, especially Gujarati NRI voters, with the help of which the leaders of the Labor Party benefited for a long time
 wemble main modi ke saath haath milakar camerun ne hawa badal di
 This was a major step to pull the Indian British vote bank into the Tory Party's court which still benefits the Tory Party today

 On behalf of the ED, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that the court cannot interfere in this matter and the investigation cannot be obstructed at the crucial stage

 ek or chaunkaane vaali baat ye he ki is maamle main kiran bedi ne bijepi ke sabhi puraane dhurandharon ko pachhad diya he
 In the India today-cicero poll earlier this week, 41 per cent of people in Delhi want to see the Aam Aadmi Party convenor as the chief minister, while Kiran Bedi is favored by 38 per cent
 lekin is res main congress bahut peeche he or dilli chunaav main unke chehraajay makanako sirf 12 fisadi log hi mukhyamantri ke taur par dekhte hai
 In the BJP, there was mixed opinion of the people when Kiran Bedi was made the Chief Ministerial candidate
 jahaan 43 fisadi logon ko yah faisla sahi laga vahiin 44 fisadi logon kaa maananaa he ki kiran bedi ko mukhyamantri pad kaa ummidavaar bananaa galat he
 More than half of the people participating in this survey believe that the Chief Ministerial candidate plays an important role in pulling votes before the election, while the party gets only 23 percent of the vote
 kejariwal par dilli kaa diladilli ke purv mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal ke bare main bhi dilli kii janata se kai sawaal kiye gaye
 Recently, at a rally held in Delhi's Ramlila Maidan, Prime Minister Modi called Kejriwal a fugitive, but the people of Delhi do not believe that
 dilli ke sirf 30 fisadi log unhen bhagoda or maatr 14 pratishat log unhen arajak samajhate hai
 When people were asked whether Kejriwal should go with the Naxalites in the jungle as per Modi's suggestion, surprisingly 44 per cent responded yes, while 34 per cent felt that the Prime Minister should not make such a statement Was
 haalanki pichley saal 49 din main hi sarkaar se istipha dene ke kaaran kejariwal kii hameshaa aalochana hoti he
 And Kejriwal himself considers it the biggest mistake of his political life, but the relief for him is that about 50 percent of the voters of Delhi like him
 25 fisadi log unhen karishmai netaa maanate hai, jabaki 22 fisadi log raajnneetik netaa
 On Kiran Bedi's inclusion of Kiran Bedi in BJP in Delhi's raianan-phanan, 37 percent of Delhi voters believe she has been included in Kejriwal's cut
 har chunaav main modi ke chehre ko saamne rakhkar vot maangane or dilli main kiran bedi ko siem ummidavaar ghoshit karne ko bhi dilli ke voter bijepi kii ranneeti main badlaav ke taur par dekhte hai
 At least 12 percent of the people believe that this time BJP also does not trust Modi wave
 jab logon se poocha gaya ki kya bijepi ke liye kiran bedi swabhaavik chunaav hai to 28 fisadi logon ne haa main jawaab diya
 13 per cent feel that the BJP did not have a face in Delhi
 dilli ke 65 fisadi votaron kaa maananaa he ki kiran bedi ne bijepi main shaamil hokar sahi kiya
 72 percent of Delhi's debatedilli voters want a debate between the chief ministerial candidates of the three parties before the election
 gauratlab he ki jaise hi bijepi ne kiran bedi ko apana mukhyamantri pad kaa ummivaar ghoshit kiya tha, vaise hi kejariwal ne unhen janata ke bich bahes kii chunauti di thi
 Kiran Bedi initially agreed to it, but later she said, the debate with Kejriwal will now be held in the Delhi Assembly itself
 udhar dilli main congress ke chehre ajay maakan ne bhi bahes ke liye hami bhar di thi
 What should be the leader of Delhi? This fight was very interesting and 40 per cent of the voters of Delhi considered Arvind Kejriwal as their leader, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi got only 31 per cent votes
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi to is res main kahin dikhe hi nahin or unhen dilli ke 7 fisadi vot mili
 In Congress President Sonia Gandhi, only 1 percent of the people of Delhi see their leader
 jabaki dilli main teen baar mukhyamantri raheen shila dikshit ko 3 fisadi log apana netaa maanate hai
 On the question of importing leaders from other parties and joining BJP, 47 per cent of Delhi voters said it was wrong and said that it is like promoting opportunism
 haalanki 36 fisadi logon kaa aisa maananaa nahin he
 Not only this, 49 percent of the people believed that the old BJP leaders who have not been given tickets will harm the party in the elections
 kaise hua sarveindia today-siciro ke is survey main dilli kii 35 vidhansabha siton ke kareeb 2000 logon se sawaal puche gaye
 The survey has been completely unbiased and according to international standards
 doodh main maujuud protein or calcium samet anya poshak tatv insaan ke shaareerik vikaas main madadgaar hai
 Perhaps this is why today the whole world is celebrating 'world Milk Day'
 jabaki congressi netaa milind devda ne apane aadhikarik twitor acount par deyari farms main pashuon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kaa ek video aplod kiya he
 With this video, Deora tagged the United Nations, writing, 'don't forget that cow is barbarously inseminated for milk and later sent to the slaughterhouse to die
 'is video main doodh utpaadan ke liye chalaai ja rahi deyari farms kii asaliyat dikhaai gai he
 Have you ever thought how milk is produced on such a large scale to meet the needs of so many people
 adhik utpaadan ke liye kai baar in pashuon ke saath krurta bhi hoti he
 The video shows that cows give milk for only one reason, to feed their baby
 insaanon kii tarah gaay bhi apane bachche ko 9 maheene garbh main rakhti he
 She feeds and grows children like we do
 stanpan kii avadhi khatm hone ke baad vah doodh dena band kar detii he, jaisaa ki thik insaan karte hai
 But milk forcibly produced in dairy farms is not only dangerous for unruly animals but also harmful for human health
 munaafe kii bhent chadh rahe pashudoodh praapt karne kii is prakritik prakriya ke baad shuru hota he deyari farm kaa vyapaar
 Artificial insemination of animals is also done here
 doodh kaa kaarobaar hameshaa munaafe main rahe iske liye ye tareeke apanaae jate hai
 During this time, the calves of the cow are also separated from the mother
 munafkhoron kii pasand femail gaay-deyari udyog main in bachhadon ke saath kaaphi dardanaak suluk hota he
 Many times dairy workers also beat them mercilessly
 maa se dur kar unhen ek kaidakhane main daal diya jaataa he, taaki ve uske aas-paas bhi na bhatak saken
 If the calf is female, it is raised only because of the fact that it too will be offered this benefit and only animal slaughter is the only available option for the calf
 kai baar ho chuki shikaayatein-aapaki icecream kaa ek-ek bite or doodh kaa har ek gilaas un maasoom bachhadon kaa adhikaar he jo unhen kabhi mila hi nahin
 On the other hand, after being separated from the child, she sings in the shelter and cries crying all day
 deyari farm ke najdiki ilaakon main rahane vaale logon ne kai baar ise lekar police main shikaayat bhi darj karwaai hai, lekin koi rasta nahin niklaa
 Cow's death in 4 to 5 years - a cow who is separated from a child for the benefits of profiteers usually loses the battle for life in 4 to 5 years
 jabaki isaki ausat aayu 20 varsh se zyada hoti he
 After death they are handed over to meat dealers
 aankade bataate hai ki 10 se 70 pratishat gaay pregnancy ke dauraan daire farm main laai jaati he
 It is obvious that they can be benefited the most at this time
 yun to sardi kaa mausam apane saath har umr ke logon ke liye kai tarah ke swasthya samasyaon ko lekar aata he
 But children are most affected by cold
 kyonki is mausam main virus or bacteria bahut teji se bacchon par hamalaa karte hai
 Because of which they have problems like colds, colds, nasal congestion, throat infection, viral diarrhea, pneumonia, fever
 isliye bacchon ko sardi ke mausam main khaas khyaal kii jarurat hoti he
 But keeping these things in mind, you will be able to keep your child healthy during the winter season
 bacchon kaa aise rakhen khyaal:1
 Instead of wearing too much clothes to protect children from the cold, keep their soles, their palms, and their ears and heads covered because these parts of the body have the highest heat loss and this is where the fear of freezing is highest
 
 isliye bacchon ke topi, dastaane or mojey jarur pahanaakar rakhen
 2
 dhoop acchhee sehat ke liye bahut jaruri hoti he
 Make your child have a sun bath sometime in the morning
 isse unako taaji hawa ke saath vitamin di bhi milegaa
 3
 bacchon ke aasapaas kabhi bhi room heater kaa istemaal naa karen
 Because the dry air coming out of the heater is very harmful for children
 4
 Avoid bathing children daily in winter
 balkigunagune pani main tauliya bhigokar unke sharir ko saaf karen
 This will not make them cold and they will also become clean
 5
 Before bathing the children must be massaged with lukewarm oil
 6
 Children often remove the quilt at bedtime
 jisase unako sardi lag jaati he
 Therefore, before putting the children to bed, spread a warm warm quilt on their bed and keep the hot water bottle on it for some time and heat their bed and make them wear woolen socks and hat with warm clothes
 taaki agar baccha razaai naa bhi pahanen to wo sardi se bachaa rahe
 7
 agar baccha ek saal se zyada umr kaa he to use mausam ke hisaab se garm fal or subjiyan khilaaen
 Fresh juice can also be given
 8
 If you have Yasardi-cold from time to time, give steam with the help of steamer
 9
 Never cover the child's face while he sleeps
 aisa karne se bachche kii saans ghut sakati he
 10
 sardi main bachche ko diaper pahana kar rakhen or thodi-thodi der baad use badalte rahen
 This will not cause cold to the child

 It is a different matter that in these by-elections, the unity of the opposition in many seats and the local equations at some places, on the line of dynastic politics, led to the dream of many candidates to become people's representatives, but the question of the politics of dynasticism remained intact

 ab jab tak court kaa faisla nahin aa jaataa tab bacchee anaath ashram main anaath kii tarah rahegi
 The case is from Ahmedabad where Kamaljeet and his lawyer wife Shiba are currently walking around the court and the Chalde Welfare House, Ludhiana

 Took a girl taken from Punjab, although she did not know that the girl whose support was taken by the Child Adoption and Resource Agency (CARA) for the purpose of grooming her life, the same agency will cause earthquake in the life of the 11-year-old girl and that girl Will face trouble in their lives and their own lives
 kamaljit or sibaa ne child adopashan and risource agency (CARA) main july 2018 main ek form bharaa jisamen unhone ek bachche ko god lene ke liye ahmedabad ke alaava punjab or madhya pradesh ko pasand kiya
 After waiting for a few days, he got a call and returned to Ahmedabad after adopting a girl from Punjab
 unhone bacchee ko ahmedabad ke ek nijee skool main daakhila dilaa diya or vahiin par uski padhai shuru ho gai
 Within 6 months, the girl told him that her parents were still alive and they had not left her, but that she had gone missing from her parents
 poochne par usne apane mata-pita kaa pataa bhi bataa diya
 Kamaljeet and his wife Shiba were shocked by this revelation
 bacchee ke khulaase se sakate main mata-pitakamaljit or shiba ne ludhiana main is sambandh main pataa karavaaya to jaankaree saamne ai ki bacchee ke mata-pita jinda hai or wo usee jagah kaam kar rahe hai jahaan kaa pataa bacchee ne bataaya tha
 The special thing is that the girl was separated from her family before coming to the child's home
 kuch din pehle hi uske parijanon ne beti kii gumshudagi kii shikaayat bhi darj karwaai thi
 Even after the complaint was lodged, the police did not make any inquiry in this regard in the child house nor did the family give any such information to the police
 is bich gujarat se aayaa parivaar is bacchee ko anaath samajhakar apana liya
 On the other hand, in Punjab, the family of the missing girl was searching for her
 puri jaankaree milane par kamaljit or shiba ne tay kiya ki god lee bacchee ko uske apane parijanon ko saunp diya jaae
 For this reason, when he went to leave the girl in the child house, it was found that the process of returning the girl is very difficult
 chunki bacchee ko kanoonee prakriya ke tahat god liya gaya tha to aage kii karrwai ke liye kanoonee prakriya kaa istemaal karnaa hoga
 Seeking legal action, Shiba, who adopts Bachchi, says that after adopting the girl legally, her name has come up as her parents and now if she has to hand over the child to her real parents then it is also legal for her Will have to cancel through the process
 iske liye court kaa aadesh jaruri he
 Now until the court order is reached, the girl will remain in the childhouse
 shiba jo khud peshey se vakil he
 He says that he himself is in touch with Chalde Welfare House Ludhiana many times so that the child can reach his real parents as soon as possible
 haalanki yah chaald welfare house puure masale par behad susti dikhaa rahi he
 Shiba demands that her feelings were played through the Chalde Welfare House, she wanted to adopt the child and give her a good life, but nowhere in this case was the Chalda Welfare House being negligent, then the investigation against her too Should be loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke maddenjar partiyon kaa chunavi abhiyaan jari he

 gujarat kii kahani ko uske alag-alag adhyyon main dekhte hai
 People were hesitant to accept Gujarat's progress, it was dismissed as 'exaggerated'
 jab aankadon main bhi tarakkee kii yahi kahani dikhi, tab se ise koi chunauti nahin detaa
 Obviously, facts cannot be 'exaggerated'
 dasvin yojana (2002-2007) ke baad se gujarat ne do ankon main tarakkee kii he
 Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have the same situation in big states
 bihar ke maamle main yah baat dhyaan main rakhi jaani chahie ki apekshaakrit zyada bade rajyon ko tarakkee ke sansaadhan jutaney main dikkat bhi hoti he
 If historical factors had supported, Karnataka should have grown faster
 tarakkee main nirantar parivartanshiltaa kii shikaayat bhi gujarat ne dur kii he or yah vahaan krishi kshetra ke pradarshan ko dikhaata he
 The work done there in the field of road, electricity (jyotigram Yojana) and Pani (transfer of water between river valleys) opened the way for many types of farming and commercialization in many historically deprived districts
 deyari, pashupaalan or bagwani iskaa udhaaharan hai
 Secondly, the story of Gujarat's progress is still misunderstood
 aam dharna yah he ki iske peeche bade udyogon kaa haath he, haalanki yahaan chote kaarkaanon or emsamai (atilaghu, laghu or majhele udhyam) clusters kii sankhya main tarakkee hui he
 Manufacturing share has declined in the state's gross domestic product and non-manufacturing sector and service sector have progressed
 isliye gujarat kii tarakkee kii daastaan krishi, emsamai, non-manufaccharing udyog or sevaaon se kahin zyada taalluk rakhti he
 Now come to the social sector
 kaha jaataa he ki gujarat ne saamaajik kshetra main acha pradarshan nahin kiya
 In terms of rural poverty, the ratio of poverty has declined sharply between 2004-05 and 2009-10
 shahari garibi bhale kam na hui ho, lekin yadi gramin garibi main kami ai to iskaa arth yah hua ki vruddhi samaveshi rahi he
 There is no evidence to suggest that inequality has increased here
 saamaajik kshetron main aankadon kii timeline ahm he kyonki saamaajik kshetra par khaas jor diya janaa gyarahavin yojana (2007-12) main hi shuru hua
 Gujarat may not have performed well in the social sectors, but the question is whether there have been minor improvements over time and whether solutions have been taken? Take an example, for example, between 2006 and 2011, there has been a rapid decline in the number of out-of-school children
 swasthya ke kshetra main doctorl dekharekh main prasav kii dar 2003-04 ke 55

 Immunization coverage has increased

 Despite the emphasis on industrialization, refinery and coastal area focused development, there has not been any major accident in coastal areas or anywhere
 iske baavjood gujarat ke maamle main tarakkee ko log sakuchaate hue maanate hai, vikaas kii daastaan ko shaayad hi koi maanata ho or prashasnic kamyaabi par to koi bharosa hi nahin karata
 Now look at the administrative side of Gujarat as well
 kahani kaa yah adhyay aanshik taur par vittiya prabandhan or kendriya tathaa centre pryojit yojanaon main kamiyon ko rajyastareey yojanaon ke sahare paatane par aadhaarit he
 Here the issue is not about increasing government spending, but more to create an atmosphere for private investment
 shiksha or swasthya, donon hi kshetron main aap paaramparik sarkari ekadhikaar ke tuutane ke lakshan dekh sakate hai
 Also, making government spending effective is an aspect of administration
 isamen i-prashasan kaa bhi ek ahm ghatak shaamil he, jisaki madad se sarkari manmarjee ko dur kiya gaya he
 The contemplation camps run after 2003 ensured that the government's work does not get entangled in the labyrinth of the departments, but for the better implementation of the schemes, ideas are taken from all quarters
 ab transfar, posting or yojana kriyanvayan rajnatik dakhlandaji se kaaphi had tak mukt ho chuke hai
 The story of governance in Gujarat is a standard example of development that is exemplary for other states
 tarakkee, vikaas or prashasan kii is kahani ko sunishchit karne vaale tatwon ko akasar alag-alag karke aank paanaa hameshaa kathin hota he
 Nevertheless, we can say that there is a legacy attached to Gujarat since all the governments before 2002 left a positive impact
 duusare, gujarat main nijee udhyamita or sarkaar ke prati aalochana ke mizaaj kii swasth parampara rahi he
 Thirdly, in the areas of water and road transport, Gujarat has always enjoyed the benefit of contact with the outside world
 rajya main automobile or auto kshetra ke kalpurjon ke kaarkaane iskaa ek udhaaharan hai
 After counting so much about the state's development tradition and heritage, you cannot deny the leadership role of Narendra Modi

 captain viraat kohli ne newjiland ke khilaaf isisi world cap ke pehle semifinal mukaable main antim ekadash main chinamen gendbaaj kuldeep yadav ko baahar karte hue duusare phiraki gendbaaj yajuvendra chahal par bharosa jataayaa he
 In this very important World Cup match, Kohli's decision was a bit shocking because Kuldeep's economy rate is much better than Chahal and he has skipped in the matter of giving runs
 haalanki wicket lene ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to yajuvendra chahal kaa pradarshan kuldeep se acha rahaa or unhone 7 maichon main 11 wicket liye hai jabaki yuva phiraki gendbaaj kuldeep yadav ne semifinal match se pehle world cap ke 7 maichon main mahaj 6 wicket jatke hai
 Talking about the more expensive economy rate, Chahal has proved to be a more expensive bowler than Kuldeep Yadav so far
 kuldeep ne world cap main khele 7 maichon main se 1 match main hi 7 se zyada ke ausat se ran die
 While his bowling economy rate in 4 matches was less than 5 runs per over
 in 7 maichon main unhone 4 baar apane cote ke puure 10 over daale jabaki 3 baar cote ke 9 over hi daale
 On the other hand, looking at the economy rate of bowling of Yajuvendra Chahal, in only 1 match out of 7, his economy rate has been less than 5 while in 6 matches his economy rate was 5 or more
 england ke khilaaf match main unhone 8
 Had scored runs at the rate of 80
 pakistan ke khilaaf mukaable main 7
 Gave runs at an average of 57
 wicket ke maamle main pichde kuldipahalanki wicket lene ke maamle main kuldeep chahal se peeche hai
 Except 2 out of 7 matches, he must have taken at least 1 wicket in every match
 chahal bhi semifinal se pehle 7 main se 5 maichon main wicket jatke hai
 They have taken 4 wickets once and 3 times 2-2 wickets
 chahal ne semifinal se pehle world cap main kul 64 over daale jisamen ek bhi madan nahin daalaa or 369 ran kharch kar die
 At the same time, Kuldeep gave only 337 runs in 67 overs and also added 2 overs
 chayan kaa kaaranhalanki wicket lene ke maamle main kuldeep yadav chahal se peeche rahe or shaayad yahi kaaran he ki vah is nirnaayak match main captain kohli kii antim 11 khilaadiyon kii pehali pasand nahin bane
 On the other hand, the specialty of Chahal's bowling is that whenever he has taken 2 or more wickets in his ODI career, the victory has gone to India's account
 shaayad yahi record sochakar kohli ne unhen is match main rakhaa ho, ab dekhnaa he ki chahal is match main 2 yaa 2 se zyada wicket jhatakkar team india ko final kaa tikat dilaa pate hai yaa nahin

 Will do

 The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) had alleged that bjp-ruled states opposed the auction of coal blocks
 bhaajapa kii varisht netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki kathith koyala ghotaale main party pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke istife kii apni maang se peeche nahin hati he or vah ab bhi apni is maang par kaayam he
 Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Sushma said that the BJP will allow the Parliament to function only when the controversial coal block allocation is canceled and an independent inquiry is ordered
 unhone kaha ki yah matlab nikaalnaa ki bhaajapa ne pradhanmantri ke istife kii maang chhod di he, galat he
 The party has shown only one way to the government so that the proceedings of the Parliament can run
 sushamaa ne kaha, "congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne teen din pehle mujhe phone kar poocha tha ki kya sansad main is mudde par charchaa ho sakati he? maine kaha ki unhen aavanton radd kerani chahie or jaanch ke aadesh dene chahie

 udhar, adwani ne apane blog par manmohan singh kii khinchaai kii
 The prime minister had alleged that the coal block was allotted to the private sector without auction because the chief ministers of some other states, including the bjp-ruled state, opposed the auction
 tippaniyan Advani wrote that the name of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh is being taken prominently
 adwani ne kaha, "raman singh kii yah maang ekadam nyyochit he ki nilaamee ke tahat rajya ko kamai ke rup main milane vaale rajasav main rajya ko hissaa mili
 How can this letter of Raman Singh be said to oppose the auction
 " Raman Singh in a letter to the then coal minister Dasari Narayan Rao on 2 May 2005 demanded that the state government should also get a share of the revenue in the event of an auction

 Net Application Management Support Delhi Metro has come out, many jobs are in Bangalore
 12veen paas ke liye naukrior zyada jaankaree ke lieyaha clic karen There have been many discussions of foreign terrorists in Kashmir in the last three decades of terrorism, and apart from Pakistan, youths of many Muslim countries have also come for Jihad in Kashmir, but the name of any global terrorist organization like al-qaeda has been revealed in the valley so far
 didn `t come
 haalanki itnaa jarur he ki saal 1994 main kashmir ghati ke pahalgam ilaake main chaar videshi paryatakon kaa pehle apharan or phir hatya ke baad jaanch agency ne us hatyakand ko kisi vaishvik aatanki sanghathan kii sajeesh se joda, kyonki tab al faraan naam ke ek sanghathan ne us hatyakand kii jimmedaari lee thi
 Although neither then nor till now the name of al-furan organization was found in any terrorist conspiracy, but a few days earlier this month, not only the security agencies of Jammu and Kashmir and the country were alert, but many foreign security organizations also acted
 i have come pehali baar alqaida ne hindustan ke khilaaf jehad ke liye apane pehle commander ke taur par jakir musa kaa naam saamne laayaa
 Zakirmusako Al Qaeda made the head of gajwa-i-hind
 koun he jakir musasaal 2014 main un kai bhatke yuvaaon kii tarah jakir musa bhikashmir main aatankirah par chal padaa, jisko kashmir main aatankiyon kii nai khep kaha jaataa he
 Zakir Shafi Bhatt, a resident of the Tral area of southern Kashmir, was a friend of Hizbul's poster boy Burhan Wani and joined terrorism through that, leaving a btech at an engineering college in Chandigarh and became a part of the Zakir Burhan brigade
 pichley saal aath july ko dakshini kashmir ke kokarnag ilaake main burhan vaani ke maare jane ke baad jakir musa hi burhan kaa jaanashin bana
 The Hizbul Mujahideen made Zakir Musa the commander of southern Kashmir and he followed the steps of Burhan Wani and released his video messages on social media the following day, but two months ago in the month of May, a statement by Zakir Musa shocked everyone when He spoke of hanging separatist leaders of Kashmir at Lal Chowk and threatened terrorist commanders living in Pakistan across the border
 jakir musa ke is bayaan se hijbul mujahidin ke pramukh said salahuddin aag bagula ho gaya or jakir musa ko hataakar duusare aatanki riyaj nayak ko dakshini kashmir main hijbul commander banaaya, lekin is bich kashmir main jakir musa ke samarthan main na sirf hijbul ke hi kai aatanki aae, balki aam logon main bhi kai saare jakir musa kaa samarthan karne lage
 His example was clearly seen in demonstrations where slogans of 'musa Musa Zakir Musa' were often raised
 lekin is puure maamle main pichley hafte bada turn tab aayaa, jab alqaida ne jakir musa ko alqaida kaa commander niyukt kiya
 Security agencies were also aware that many jihadis in different areas of Kashmir are still considering Zakir Musa as their rich
 yahaan tak kii pichley maheene maare gaye do lashkar aatankiyon kii ek baatcheet jab suraksha balon ke haath lagi, to marane se pehle un donon lashkar aatankiyon ne jakir musa se baat kii thi
 Even on Tuesday, Lashkar commander Abu Dujana, who was killed in Pulwama district of southern Kashmir, was said to be working with Zakir Musa and was in the UPA
 kashmir main hijbul mujahidin or usase nikle jakir musa ke group ke bich khub bayaanbajiyaan chalati raheen, lekin jakir musa kashmir main dhire-dhire hi sahi apni jameen banaata rahaa
 Security agencies in the country have already put Zakir Musa in the Most Listed list and have also issued a reward of 1
5 million for catching his dead or alive
 alqaida kaa commander banane ke baad guuruuvaar ko jakir musa ne pehali tasviir soshal media par daali, jisamen vah akelaa nahin, balki uske saath aath or aatanki dikh rahe hai
 This clearly shows that Zakir Musa is not alone, but in Kashmir he has succeeded in establishing a large group of al-qaeda's thinking, which is a matter of concern for Kashmir as well as the security agencies of the country, Because Zakir Musa is attracting youth from Kashmir as well as from different parts of the country and is also in touch with many youth

" isliye mujhe hatya main modi ke shaamil hone kaa shaq he

 ishrat ke ek rishtedaar rauf lala ne kaha, ‘ibi ke jariye gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko ishrat se jude tathyon ke bare main sab kuch maaloom tha
 Ishrat's mother Shamima Kausar, who was killed in a fake encounter in 2004, expressed happiness over the CBI charge sheet
 unhone kaha ki sibiai ne unki us baat par muhar laga di he ki unki beti nirdosh thi
 He said that she had been saying this for nine years
 ishrat ko yaad karte parivaar kaa dard chhalak aayaa
 With tears in her eyes, Shamima said, 'we had to face these problems because of a few policemen and politicians
 hatya ke asal gunahagaaron ke naam chargeshit main nahin hai
 It is expected that the conspirators will get strict punishment
 ’ishrat kii bahan mushrat ne bataaya ki hatya ke vakt unki bahan biessi second year main thi

 The Delhi High Court has refused to keep the relationship of native-in-relationship out of the purview of rape under the Indian Penal Code
 hoicourt ne kaha ki aisa karne kaa matlab is rishte ko vaivaahik darja praapt karnaa hoga, jiskaa vidhayika ne chayan nahin kiya he
 a division bench of Chief Judge Rohini and Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw said that as far as the relationship of live-in-relation is concerned outside the purview of Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code, doing so means live-in-relation Must obtain marital status and the legislature has chosen not to do so

 The petition argued that in many cases it has been found that the courts have acquitted the rape accused because the women had filed false cases

 kya ek baar phir notebandi hone vaali he, kya do hajaar ke note band hone vaale hai? ji haa, aisi khabaren soshal media par chal rahi hai, jinamein kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar do hajaar ke noton ko band karne ja rahi he, uski jagah phir se ek hajaar ke note chalan main aaenge
 Aajtak did a viral test of how much power this viral news has
 8 november 2016 kii raat 8 baje pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi kaa aitihaasik faisla sunaaya tha
 After which the old notes of one thousand and 500 were discontinued
 puraa desh line main lag gaya tha
 There was trouble
 tab do hajaar rupee or paanch sau rupee ke nae note aae the, jise paane ke liye bainkon or atm ke saamne kataren lag gai thim
 Once again the phase of cash crisis has started in the country
 bazaar se do hajaar ke note kareeb-kareeb gaayab ho gaye hai
 Printing of two thousand notes has also stopped
 jiske chalate desh ke tamaam rajyon main cash kii killat ho gai
 atms are running empty
 bank shakhaon main bhi cash kii kami ho gai he
 Actually, news of demonetisation is spreading once again on social media
 watsape, twitor or fasebuk par is tarah kii khabaren viral ho rahi hai ki sarkaar do hajaar ke noton ko band kar sakati he
 Along with this, RBI will issue new notes of 1 thousand rupees instead of two thousand rupees
 ye khabar hamaare liye bahut ahm thi, lihaaja hamane isaki padtaal kii
 Since the Reserve Bank of India takes the decision to issue new notes or to close old notes, we spoke to the RBI officials, officially emailed and sought their response
 viral khabaron ke mutabik sarkaar do hajaar ke note band kar sakati he
 a report of the State Bank of India is being cited in the viral news
 arabiai ab 2 sau or 5 sau rupee ke noton kii chapai par zyada dhyaan de rahi he
 It has also been said in the viral news that the government is now preparing to print one thousand new notes
 viral khabar ke mutabik do hajaar ke note band ho jaaenge, ek hajaar kaa nayaa note aayega
 One thing became clear from the talks with the experts of the banks that RBI has stopped the printing of 2 thousand notes at present
 jo desh main cash killat kii badi vajah bhi bani
 These reports have gone viral at a time when there is a cash crisis in the country and there are allegations of hoarding of two thousand rupee notes, we talked to the experts of RBI and banks in our investigation
 arabiai ke afasar camere ke saamne baatcheet ke liye raji nahin hue, lekin email se unhone is sawaal kaa jawaab diya ki kya do hajaar ke note band karke ek hajaar ke note chhapane kii taiyaari kii ja rahi he
 The Reserve Bank of India, in its reply, made it clear that RBI is not going to stop the 2 thousand notes
 ek hajaar rupee ke nae note chhapane kii dur-dur tak koi yojana nahin he
 Viral reports of the closure of two thousand notes and the circulation of one thousand new notes are just rumors

 In such a situation, the Supreme Court can decide today whether to file a criminal case against the Talwar couple and prosecute it

 ye kisi film kii kahani nahin balki ahmedabad main somvaar raat kii hakeekat he
 The spunk police officer who carried out this name is DCP Manjita Vanjara
 shahar ke jis isanpur ilaake menjue kaa addachalaya ja rahaa tha, vahaan police kaa pahunchnaa hi kaaphi mushkil tha
 Narrow streets
 ab kis gali main kis ghar main chapa maarna he, ise tay karnaa bhi mushkil tha
 It had been reported for a long time that Juapulis had received information that Mohammad alias Sheru and Nasir Khan Pathan had been gambling for a long time in a street house near the mosque in Isanpur
 manjita vanjaaraa par puraa bharosa hone kii vajah se senior officers ne unhen is oparation ko anjaam hone kii jimmedaari di
 But if the police were already in the area where the gambling was going on, the gamblers would have escaped without leaving any evidence
 isliye ranneeti ye banaai gai ki manjeeta vanjaaraa ko burke main vahaan bheja jaae
 There was an inspector with plain clothes and a sub-inspector in plain clothes should also be sent along with him
 byaap ke liye police kii team bhi har vakt puri tarah mustaid rahe
 The police team reaches there as soon as Manjita gestures
 jue ke adde par aisa bhi mauka aayaa jab manjita vanjaaraa 28 juaariyon ko lalkaarte hue vahaan akeli khadi thim
 The rest of the police team took some time to get there
 lekin manjita vanjaaraa ne puri dilari dikhaate hue sthiti kaa saamana kiya
 28 gamblers were arrested from the spot
 jua khilaane ke saamaan ke saath 1 lakh 14 hajaar rupee bhi jabt kiye gaye
 Manjita Vanjara spoke to India Today Group, Aaj Tak / India Today spoke to this entire operation
 manjita ne kaha ki unhen jo duty saunpi gai thi, unhone use hi anjaam diya
 According to Manjita, she considers herself a police officer, so there is nothing special in this because of the lady police officer
 manjita ne kaha ki jue ke adde par karrwai se pehle wo do ghante tak us ilaake main burka pahan kar raheen
 He and his fellow sub-inspectors kept pretending that someone was looking for a lost relative
 andeh se ghur rahe the loglekin phir bhi vahaan unhen pehali baar dekhe jane kii vajah se kai ankhen unhen andeh se ghurti raheen
 According to Manjita, there was a risk in this action but police officers have to be trained to deal with every situation
 manjita ne kaha ki unke peeche byaap team thi isliye wo aashwast thim
 Manjita laughed saying that the glut of mosquitoes in those narrow streets definitely disturbed her
 ahmedabad ke epa divijan main tainaat manjita vanjaaraa pehle bhisex racketke khulaase samet is tarah ke kai oparation ko anjaam de chuki hai
 In 2013, Manjita came to the Police Service after completing her UPSC examination engineering

 film kaa naam: juli 2diarector: deepak shivadaasaneestar cast: raay lakshmi, pankaj treepathi, ravi kishan, aditya shrivastavavadhi: 2 ghante 15 minutesrtificate: aretimga: 1
 Julie was produced by Director Deepak Shivdasani in 5 Star 2004
 is film main neha dhoopiya mukhya bhoomika main najar ai thim
 Now 13 years later he has made Julie 2
 kya yah film waisi hi ban padi he jaisi 13 saal pehle neha kii thi? ise jaanane ke liye aaie film kii samiksha padhate hai
 
 
 The story of the film is of Julie (rai Lakshmi)
 vah apni maa ke saath ek aise parivaar main rahati he jahaan uskaa sautele pita bhi he
 There is an illegitimate child whom he later discovers
 juli ne acting or dance kaa course kar rakhaa he
 But he does not have work
 jab wo kaam kii talash main jaati he to nirmaataa-nirdeshak use duusari najar se dekhte hai
 Different people have entry in his life
 isi dauraan wo chrishchiyan mahila eni ke paas pahunchati he
 He starts getting work
 lekin ek vakt ke baad phir uske paas kaam nahin he
 Then he has to make compromises
 wo alag-alag tareeke ke logon se milane kii koshish karti he
 During this, there are many twists and turns
 inhen ke saath film kii kahani aage badhati he
 Eventually a big twist comes in the story when Julie goes to do a queen's biopic film 'devi'
 kai saare raaj kaa pardaafaash hota he
 The queen who is a queen has a death
 uske pati hai pankaj treepathi
 You will have to watch the film to know how Pankaj Tripathi, Ravi Kishan and Nishikant Kamat have an entry in the story
 Review: potee se rape kaa badla leti hai ajji, jhakzor detii he kahanikyon naa dekhenfilm kii kahani bor karne vaali he
 It is a cliché story
 revange drama bahut saare banaae gaye hai, lekin juli 2 bahut hi kamjor kahani he
 You know what is going to happen next moment
 thriller to he par ye kahin thriller jaisi lagati nahin he
 a film of about two and a half hours seems larger than 3 hours
 film main gane bhi bade bade hai
 The songs could be shortened
 editing or chust ho sakati thi
 The story of the film could have been made better
 lambey lambey shots ko chota kiya ja saktaa tha
 It was necessary to work on the story, the lack of which is clearly understood while watching the film
 raay lakshmi ne hindi film main samvaad ruk-ruk kar bolaa he
 It is a bit strange
 film kii kahani kabhi lav angel kii taraf jaati he kabhi revange drame kii taraf to kabhi imoshan kii taraf pahunch jaati he
 The story has many ends that go astray
 Review: kadavi hawa main sanjay mishra kaa shandaar abhinay, yaad kii jaaegi filmakyon dekhegar aapako irotic filmon kaa bahut shauk he or aapako pehali vaali juli pasand ai thi to ise dekh sakate hai
 Talking about the characters, the work of Pankaj Tripathi, Ravi Kishan is quite good
 raay lakshmi or nishikant kaa bhi kaam thik-thaak he
 Rati Agnihotri has done a great job
 acting ke lihaaj se film thik he
 But the story is boring
 log aisi film kyon paise lagaakar dekhne jaaenge ye sochane vaali baat he
 The film has received an adult certificate
 agar aap edlt hai to hi theatre main film dekhne jaae
 Or wait for the film to appear on TV
 bajatbajet kareeb 9-10 karod rupee he
 At the box office, the film may find it difficult to make money
 film or behatar banaai ja sakati thi
 It will be difficult to see how much the film will earn at the box office

 bulandshahr hinsa main shahid hueinspectorsubodh kumaar singh kihatyakearopisena ke jawan jitendra malik urf jitufojise 10 ghante lambii poochtacha kii gai
 During this, many questions were asked to Jeetu
 haalanki is maamle main police abhi tak hinsa ke mukhya aaropee or sajeeshkarta bajrang dal netaa yogesh raaj or bijepi netaa shikhar agarwal ko giraftaar nahin kar saki he
 When the UP STF arrested Jitendra Malik alias Jeetu Fauji, a soldier of 22 Rajputana Rifles posted in Sopore, Jammu and Kashmir, he was questioned for 10 consecutive hours
 SIT or STF ne is lambii poochtacha ke dauraan usase kareeb 500 sawaal puche
 However, Bajrang Dal leader Yogesh Raj, the mastermind of the Bulandshahr violence, is still out of the grip of the police
 vahi nahin uskaa doosraa saathi bijepi netaa shikhar agarwal bhi abhi tak faraar he
 The SIT report and the forensic investigation report are now awaited in the case
 isse pehle bulandshahr hinsa ke aaropee shikhar agarwal kaa video bhi saamne aayaa tha
 In which he was raising his finger and telling himself innocent
 us video ko dekhne ke baad logon ko gussa bhi aayaa tha
 The accused BJP leader also used profanity against the martyr Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh
 unhen gaaliyaan di thi
 Before that a video message was also released by Yogesh Raj, the main conspirator of the violence
 usne bhi khud ko begunaah bataaya tha
 He said that he was in the police station at the time of the incident
 use nahin pataa ki hinsa kaise bhadki
 Who murdered the inspector video main uskaa huliya bhi badla hua tha
 That clean shave was visible
 baat-baat par encounter karne vaali upi police abhi tak hinsa ke do mukhya aropiyon ko khoj nahin paa rahi he
 UP police making big claims seems helpless and helpless in this case
 jabaki sabaki nigahen upi police par hi lagi hai
 Questions are being raised on Khaki uniform as to when she will play her duty
 kab bulandshahr hinsa ke darindon ko giraftaar kar jail bhejegi
 What is the matter, on December 3, UP Police Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was shot dead during the violence in Bulandshahr on suspicion of Gokshi
 us hinsak bheed main jammu-kashmir ke sopor main tainaat 22 raajapootaana rifles kaa jawan jitendra malik urf jitu faujee bhi shaamil tha
 The police had registered an FIR against the military
 hinsa ke baad giraftaar logon se poochtacha or hinsa ke video khangaalane ke baad police ko shaq hua ki goli shaayad jitu faujee ne hi chalaai thi
 After this, the police issued a non-bailable warrant against Jeetu Fauji and two teams of UP STF reached Jammu and Kashmir on 6 December
 bulandshahr main maujuud upi estf ke adhikariyon ne army ke adhikariyon se sampark saadhaa or bulandshahr kii ghatana main jitendra faujee ke shaamil hone ke bare main bataaya or police ko handover karne ko kaha
 UP STF officials said that when contacted the senior officer of the army, at the same time, Jitu Fauji was kept in custody in the army barrack
 lekin army ke afasaron ne jammu-kashmir main jitu faujee ko upi police ko nahin saunpa
 In fact, since the killing of the soldiers in the valley, the army is very alert, so the army officers themselves handed over Jitu Fauji to the STF

 By the way, you must have heard the news of the theft
 lekin haal hi main chori kii ek ajeebogareeb ghatana saamne ai he
 This theft is also strange because the theft is not of money, jewelry or any valuables, but of a bottle
 aaie ham bataate hai ki aakhir is bottle main aisa kya khaas tha jo chor ise le bhaaga
 The world's most expensive vodka bottle was stolen from 'cafe 33' once in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark
 ye vodaka bottle bahut keemtee he
 Its most special thing is that this bottle is made of 3 kg gold and 3 kg silver
 iske dhakkan main keemtee heere jade hue hai
 The price of this bottle is US $ 1
 3 million yani 8
 2 crores is being told
 itnaa hi nahin, is bottle kaa istemaal america kii ek tivi siries 'house of cards' main bhi ho chukaa he
 If you like health, do not do anything after eating, this incident happened in the Kamjis bar, according to its owner 'brian Angberg', the bottle was not his own
 balki unhone is bottle ko rus ke bijnesaman se lone par liya hua tha
 The thief had cleaned the hand on the bottle very closely, but the theft of CCTV cameras in the bar was captured
 footage main saaf dekha gaya ki ek purush sir par topi or chehre ko dhak kar baar ke andar aayaa or bottle lekar vahaan se chalaa gaya
 Twins born different years, Doctor Haranasutra, believe that only the vodka bottle has been stolen from the bar
 jabaki vahaan maujuud lagbhag 1,200 vodaka bottle ko chor ne chuaa tak nahin
 As of now, the person who has stolen the vodka bolat has not been identified due to the face covering
 police maamle kii tahakikat main lagi hui he
 It will be interesting to see how long it is able to stay with the thief in the precious bottle
 bijepi se 6 saal ke liye nishkasit hue dayashankar singh kii patni swati singh ne apane or beti ke khilaaf die gaye aapattijanak bayanon par jis tarah basapa par hallaa bolaa, usase ve ratorat charchaa main aa gayi
 But few people will know that Swati, who talks about respect for women, is herself an accused in the case of female harassment
 swati ke loha lene kii kshamta ne bijepi ko itnaa prabhavit kiya ki pati kii jagah unhen chunaav ladaane kii charchaa ho rahi thi
 Actually, Swati Singh is accused of assaulting her sister-in-law, getting her brother's second marriage without getting divorced, and getting her sister-in-law out of the house
 lakhanu ke ashiana thane main swati ke khilaaf apni hi bhabhi ke ke khilaaf marpet, gaali-galouj or gharelu hinsa kaa maamla darj he
 Sister-in-law had filed a case against Swati, the case against Swati was lodged by Asha Singh, the wife of his immediate brother
 ye maamla kareeb 11 saal purana he
 In 2008, Asha Singh lodged a case against her sister-in-law Swati's second marriage for her husband at Ashiana police station in Lucknow
 dayashankar or swati main bhi chal rahi he takaraaryahi nahin, swati or dayashankar singh ke aapasi sambandh bhi kaaphi kharaab rahe hai
 In 2008, Swati complained of assault against her husband
 us vakt naubat talaak tak pahunch gai thi, lekin philhal donon ore se pichley kuch samay se sulah kii koshishen chal rahi he
 Swati Singh still lives in her maiden while Dayashankar Singh with her mother
 is maamle main donon parivaar philhal kuch nahin bol rahe, lekin ab swati ko is maamle jabaab dena mushkil pad saktaa he
 Swati Singh's clarification on 'aaj Tak' Swati Singh and his brother Puneet Singh gave their clarification on 'aaj Tak' after the domestic violence case against Swati Singh came to light
 swati ne kaha ki ye maamla 2005 kaa he jab wo pregnent hone kii vajah se apane maayke main rahati thi, tab vahaan unke bhai or bhabhi ke bich jhagada hota rahata he jisamen unki bhabhi ne bhai or puure parivaar par dahej utpeedan kaa cese darj karaayaa tha
 According to Swati, she used to live there at that time, so along with the whole family, her name was also put in the case
 lekin baad main sunwaayee ke dauraan unka naam hataa diya gaya, isliye ab unpar koi maamla darj nahin he
 Swati's refusal of sour relations between husband and wife, besides clarifying the differences between her husband Dayashankar Singh and divorce, Swati said that there was a rift between the two, but it was the same as between husband and wife
 Is, but both have been settled a few months ago and all is well now
 vahiin swati ke bhai punit ne kaha ki patni se adalati ladaai chal rahi he or abtak maamla nahin sulajhaa he
 BJP said personal matter, according to Lucknow SP, this matter is not in their cognizance at present
 chunki maamla kareeb 11 saal purana he isliye puri padtaal ke baad hi koi pratikriya di ja sakati he
 BJP is calling it a family and personal matter of Dayashankar Singh, but despite allegations of harassment, BJP is currently standing firmly with Swati Singh
 bharat sarkaar kii ore se 3 agast 2015 ko ek sandesh sabhi media sanghathanon ko bheja gaya jisamen kaha gaya ki ek bahut badi ghoshnaa kiye janaa apekshit he
 Shortly thereafter, the historic 'framework Agreement' was announced between the Government of India and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (isaac-muivah) or NSCN (IM)
 is elaan se naa sirfangaabadi main ummid kii kiran jaagi balki desh ke anya hisson main bhi iskaa swaagat kiya gaya
 People understood that the longest-running disturbed activities in one part of the country would put a stop to it
 ‘fremavarm samjhaute’ ke elaan ko teen saal se bhi zyada kaa samay biit chukaa he
 What was written in the 'framework Agreement' is not publicly available
 is sambandh main baatcheet main kya pragati hui he, isko lekar bhi logon ko koi jaankaree nahin he
 Last month, the Ministry of Home Affairs submitted a report to the Standing Committee of Parliament on the status of the North East states
 report main kaha gaya ki NSCN- IM bhartiya sangh ke bheetar hi ‘vishesh darje’ ke saath avasthaapan (satalment) ke liye taiyaar he
 NSCN-IM wants to expand the border of Nagaland with Naga-affected areas of neighboring states like Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh
 naga sanghathan se vaartakar kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe aar en ravi ne cameti ko bataaya ki naga ab sarkaar ke saath saajha sahmati par pahunch chuke hai ki ‘rajyon kii simaaon ko nahin chuaa jayega’ or ‘naga, jahaan bhi hai unke liye kuch vishesh prabandh kiye jaaenge’
 According to the report of Indian Express on 26 April 2018, the basic part of the peace agreement between the central government and the Naga armed group has been finalized
 is report ke mutabik sirf ek hi baadha aade aa rahi he or wo he rajya ke liye naga kii ore se alag jhande kii maang karnaa
 The report also cited a statement by Ravi of the Center in August 2015 that said, "yes, we (naga Shanti) have come very close to finalizing the agreement"
 teen saal baad 22 july 2018 ko ‘da hindu’ main prakashit ek report ke mutabik naga shanti samjhauta lagbhag taiyaar he lekin sarkaar ko hastaksharkartaaon ke sambandh main abhi faisla lenaa he
 There is clearly confusion as to who will sign the agreement on behalf of the Naga groups and it may take some time to decide
 india today ne in sab sanshayon ke bich sthiti ko spasht karne ke liye grih mantralay main soochna ke adhikaar (RTI) ke tahat yachika daakhil kii
 Under the first link of questions, we asked the government - when did the government start talks with Naga groups? Which group is being negotiated? How much money has been spent on the talks and what facilities are being provided to these Naga groups by the government? In the response received by the government, there was a clear refusal to give any such information
 jawaab main kaha gaya- ‘aapaki ore se maangi gai soochna bahut samvedansheel he or is par jaankaree saajha karnaa rashtriya suraksha hiton kii drushti se nuksaandeh hoga’
 In the second episode of questions, we asked about the important points of the 'framework Agreement'
 hamane ye bhi poocha ki kya NSCN- IM bhartiya sangh ke bheetar hi ‘vishesh darje’ ke saath satalment ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he? or kya ye isliye bhi taiyaar ho gaya he ki kisi bhi rajya kii simaaon ko naa to badla jayega or naa hi chhedaa jayega? grih mantralay ne iskaa jawaab diya- ‘ye suchit kiya jaataa he ki naga bhumigat samoohon ke saath raajnneetik baatcheet abhi puri nahin hui he
 In such a situation, it may be detrimental to the peace process
 sarkaar koi soochna saajha nahin karnaa chaahati
 While some of them are already in the public domain
 sarkaar ne kuch soochna sansad kii sthai samiti ke saath saajha kii lekin saath hi ye mana ki baatcheet abhi jari he
 
 
 Such a Surat is due to be completed three years after the announcement of the Historical Framework Agreement
 ye swaabhaavik he ki is sambandh main kuch kahaniyaan or theory tair rahi hai or vahiin sarkaar aadhikarik taur par naa to kuch sweekaar kar rahi he or naa hi khaarij kar rahi he
 The government is just saying that the talks have not been completed yet
 lekin aam taur par jinka paksh is vaarta se judaa he yaa jo naga mudde ko baariki se dekh rahe hai wo ‘fremawork samjhaute’ ke elaan kii pehle kii sthiti se bhi ab zyada aspasht hai
 Now the biggest question is, how long will the government allow the status of doubt? And who has the most benefit from letting such things hang - Naga people? Naga leaders? Yamodi government? jharkhand main paanch charan main ho rahe vidhansabha chunaavmadhu kodaa kaa siyaasi safar majdoor se CM takjharkhand kii siyasat main 2006 main aisa raajnneetik ulatpher hua or raturaat ek nirdaleey vidhayak mukhyamantri kii kursi par virajman ho jaataa he
 The name of this charismatic person is Madhu Koda
 purv mukhyamantri madhu kodaa is baar jharkhand vidhansabha chunaav nahin lard paaenge
 Although he approached the high court to contest the elections to contest the elections, he was not relieved
 khadaan main mazdooree karne vaale ek shaks ke jharkhand kaa mukhyamantri madhu kodaa banane tak kaa safar behad romaanchak he
 In the last assembly election, Koda lost from Manjhgaon assembly seat in Chaibasa
 jharkhand ke pashchim singhbhum ke jagannathpur ke paatahatu gaanv main madhu kodaa kaa janm 6 janvari, 1971 ko hua
 Madhu Koda's early life was fraught with struggles, which led to him working as a laborer in the mine to run a house
 iske alaava unke pita bhi khet main mazdooree kaa kaam kiya karte the
 Traveling from MLA to CM, Madhu Koda, who started his political career from Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU), was active in the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), then reached the assembly for the first time on a BJP ticket
 congress or jharkhand mukti morcha ke sahyog se vah jharkhand ke pehle aise mukhyamantri bane, jo nirdaleey chunakar aae the
 Despite being an independent MLA, Koda became the third CM of the country to have the distinction of becoming the Chief Minister
 jharkhand ke paanchaven mukhyamantri ke rup main madhu kodaa ne 18 sitambar, 2006 ko shapath lee or 27 agast 2008 tak rahe
 In this way Madhu Koda completed his 23-month term as Chief Minister
 desh main madhu kodaa se pehle koi nirdaleey vidhayak itnaa lambey samay tak siem pad par nahin rahaa tha
 The political journey of the political inauguration started by AJSU started with student politics with All Jharkhand Student Union (AJSU)
 iske baad kodaa aresas se jud gayi
 He also continued to work as a union worker
 isse pehle vah theka shramik hua karte the
 Then the workers became union leaders
 aresas main kaam karne ke dauraan unki pahchaan jharkhand ke pehle mukhyamantri babulal marandi se hui
 This is where Koda got political recognition and then he did not look back
 marandi ne hi saal 2000 main pehali baar kodaa ko jagannathpur vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke tikat par chunaav ke maidan main utaara
 Koda won and became an MLA
 marandi ke netritv main sarkaar main madhu kodaa panchayat raaj mantri bane
 After this, Arjun was also a minister in Munda government in 2003
 jharkhand ke 2005 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ne madhu kodaa kaa tikat kaat diya, jiske baad unhone party se baghawat kar nirdaleey chunavi maidan main utre or jitkar ek baar phir vidhayak chune gaye
 In 2005, the rebel independent MLA from the BJP, Bainsal, did not get any majority in the 2005 assembly elections, after which the BJP government led by Arjun Munda was supported by Madhu Koda and became the Minister of Mining
 haalanki jald hi unka arjuna munda ke saath rishte main bigaad aa gaya
 Realizing the political mood of the occasion, Congress and JMM added Madhu Koda to their camp
 iske baad madhu kodaa ne teen anya nirdaleey vidhayakon ko apane bharose main liya or bijepi sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya
 Due to this, the BJP government led by Arjun Manda fell
 madhu kodaa ne saal 2006 main sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kiya
 In the Koda government, JMS, RJD, United Gomantak Democratic Party, NCP, Forward Bloc and three independents joined
 jabaki, congress ne baahar se samarthan kiya tha
 Madhu Koda even after becoming the Chief Minister kept the Mining Department, Energy and other important departments with him
 madhu kodaa ke daaman laga daagamadhu kodaa ke mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan vinod sinha naamak vyakti charchaa main aayaa
 After this, the Income Tax Department raided Koda, Vinod and 167 places around the country and during Koda's tenure, there were cases of corruption in allocation of coal, iron and mines and work allocation in Energy Department
 iske baad jaanch agenciyaan sakriy huin or kodaa va anya ke khilaaf maamla darj hua
 This led to the Congress withdrawing support from the Madhu Koda government, after which JMM chief Shibu Soren replaced Madhu Koda as the CM and assumed power
 madhu kodaa ke khilaaf iskar va pravartan nideshaalay (idi) kaa shikanja kasata gaya
 As a result, in November 2009, the Enforcement Directorate arrested Koda
 vah teen saal se adhik samay tak jail main hi rahe
 Madhu Koda, however, contested from Chaibasa seat in Jharkhand in 2009 and won and became an MLA
 chunaav ayog ko shikaayatein mili thim ki kodaa ne chunaav kharch kaa sahi byoraa nahin diya
 After this, in September 2017, the Election Commission has banned Madhu Koda from contesting elections for three years
 isi kaa nateeja he ki madhu kodaa is baar chunaav maidan se baahar hai
 Whereas, he wanted to contest the assembly from Jagannathpur seat on a Congress ticket
 madhya pradesh main sattarudh bijepi kii andruni kalah us samay baahar aa gai, jab nivartmaan bhaajapa vidhayak sudarshan gupta ne apni hi party ke varisht netaa vishnu prasad shukla ko kathith taur par ‘historishiter’ bataa diya
 Due to this, Shukla also reacted strongly against Sudarshan Gupta
 shuukravaar ko shukla ne kaha, ‘agar philhal vidhansabha chunaav nahin hote or gupta mere khilaaf is tarah kii galat baat bolte, to main ghunsa markar unke daant gira detaa
 BJP leader Shukla, popularly known as "bade Bhaiya", said, "gupta is my party (BJP) candidate in the assembly elections and my son is contesting in front of him
 lihaaja main is sthiti main abhi shant rahanaa hi behatar samajhataa hum
 'sudarshan Gupta is a BJP MLA from constituency-1 of Indore city and is the vice president of the party's state unit
 bhaajapa ne 28 november ko hone vaale vidhansabha chunaavon main unhen bataur ummidavaar phir chunaav maidan main utaara he
 BJP made a mistake by giving ticket to rival's father 3 times: Gupta's seat has been given by Congress to Sanjay Shukla, son of BJP leader Vishnu Prasad Shukla
 sudarshan gupta ne ek akhbaar ke haalia chunavi kaarykram ke dauraan vishnu prasad shukla ko kathith taur par ‘historishiter’ bataate hue kaha tha ki bhaajapa ne unke chunavi pratidwandvi ke pita ko pichley chunaavon main teen baar tikat dekar galati kii
 BJP general secretary had to come forward to cool the case
 bjp's national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya had to come forward to calm the matter over the controversy over Sudarshan Gupta's statement
 samachar agency bhashaa ne vijayawargeey ke hawaale se kaha, ‘uttejnaa main gupta ke munh se bade bhaiya ke liye galat shabd nikal gaye the
 The elder brother is a senior BJP leader
 congress ke purvavarti shasankaal main unke khilaaf jhuthe maamle darj karaae gaye the
 As far as i know, he has not slapped anyone in his life
 ’vishnu prasad shukla ko lekar vivaadaaspad bayaan ke bare main puche jane par gupta ne kaha, ‘is maamle main hamaari party ke rashtriya mahasachiv pehle hi bayaan de chuke hai

 This thing called cheap almonds is full of benefits, makes bones strong
 motopa kam karne ke bahut se upaay kiye jate hai
 But when it increases so much that it does not decrease with efforts or causes more damage to the body, then weight loss surgery is resorted to
 yah surgery motaape se jujh rahe kai logon ke liye jindagi badalane vaala kadam sabit ho sakati he
 But this surgery may lead to nutritional deficiencies in their body in the future, which if not taken care of properly may cause health problems
 sabase pehle yah jaananaa jaruri he ki sharir main kahaan or kitni vasa jamaa ho gai he
 Obesity can call many diseases
 inamen se kuch hai- - Arthritis, heart, liver and blood pressure diseases can occur

 com / ukmnd3wnsp— Abdul Qadir (@imaqadir)january 15, 2017 The war of words between Shiv Sena and BJP continues ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke bayaan par palatwaar karte hue shivasena ne kaha ki chunaav purv gathbandhan par bijepi pramukh ke bayaan se saaf he ki unhen hindutv main vishwaas rakhane vaale logon ke saath kaam karne main zyada ruchi nahin he
 BJP has more faith in evms
 isliye shivasena akele chunaav ladane ko taiyaar he
 Shiv Sena, the oldest NDA ally, has made it clear that bjp's stance is not good
 bataa den ki amit shah ne ravivaar ko maharashtra ke latur main shivasena kaa sidhe taur par naam na lete hue chetavanee di thi ki agar gathbandhan hota he to party apane sahyogi dalon kii jeet sunishchit karegi or agar aisa nahin hota he to party aagaamee loksabhaa chunaavon main apane purv sahyogiyon ko karaari shikast degi
 Shivsenane did not delay in retaliating Shah's statement
 shivasena ne kaha kiamit shaahake is uksaane vaale bayaan ne unki or party kii soch saamne laa di he
 The Shiv Sena chief had expressed the sentiments of the people of this country as 'first temple again government', but that statement drove the BJP away from the ground and now their tongue is slipping
 aisa lagata he ki bijepi hindutv main vishwaas rakhane vaale logon ko nahin chaahati he
 Shiv Sena said that it is clear from the results of five states that people of the country have started showing them their place
 kam se kam 40 siton par jite ke daawey ne saaf kar diya he ki vah iviem se gathbandhan karne ja rahe hai
 The Shiv Sena has been unsure of an alliance with the BJP in Maharashtra
 bataa den ki maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne bijepi kaaryakartaaon ko rajya kii 48 loksabhaa siton main se 40 par jeet hasil karne kaa lakshya diya he
 His statement also retaliated by Shiv Sena
 isse pehle amit shah ne marathavada main bijepi ke booth str ke kaaryakartaaon ko sambodhit kiya
 Meanwhile, the BJP president said that party workers should stay away from the confusion of the possibility of an alliance
 agar sahyogi dal hamaare saath aate hai to ham unki jeet sunishchit karenge, varanaa ham unhen patake denge
 Party workers should prepare at every booth
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha he kidesh ko 'police raaj' main tabdeel karne se modi kii samasyaayein hal nahin hongi
 He alleged that this would only prove that Modi is an 'insecure dictator'
 rahul gandhi ne twit kar kaha, 'modi ji, bharat ko police raaj main badalane se aapaki samasyaayein hal nahin hone vaali he
 'this is going to prove to just one and more than one billion Indian citizens what kind of insecure dictator you are'
 gauratlab he ki modi sarkaar ne ek aisa aadesh jari kiya he, jiske tahat ab kisi bhi computer kaa data sarkaar khangaal sakati he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has extended the powers of 10 central agencies to check computer data
 jaanch agenciyaan ab kisi bhi computer main maujuud data kii jaanch kar sakengi
 This is the first time many agencies have been given such rights
 kendriya grih sachiv rajeev gauba ne guuruuvaar ko is bare main aadesh jari kiye
 After this, the opposition attacked the government and called it an attack on the right to privacy
 congress netaa anand sharma ne kaha ki sarkaar kaa yah aadesh moulik adhikaron ke khilaaf he
 According to the decision of the Supreme Court on this, this privacy is your fundamental right
 niztaa ke adhikaar par yah aadesh chot pahunchaata he
 By this order, the government is allowing to view the complete information of every citizen of the country
 isse prajatantr ko bhi bada khatra paidaa ho gaya he
 We have said that on behalf of the government, a large number of respected people, mps or senior officials or judges of the Supreme Court, High Court are also getting their telephones checked
 ham iskaa virodh karenge
 This is not acceptable for any democracy
 tees maar khan kii asafalataa se koreagrapher-nirdeshak farah khan ko kaaphi sabak mila he
 Farah said, "I may have got the award for choreography in Tees Maar Khan, but it does not get everything
" pichhali do filmon ko mili safalataa kii tulana main ise utani safalataa hasil nahin ho saki
 There were a lot of expectations attached to this film, but, i have no regrets for it
 unhone kaha, prashansak mujhase kaaphi zyada apeksha rakhte hai
 i have learned a lot from my failure
 isse aapako aage ke dinon main sahaayta milti he
 Akshay Kumar starrer Tees Maar Khan could not create any magic among fans, but one of its item songs, Sheela Ki Jawani, was taken up by people
 farah ab chauthi film ke nirdesan ke liye taiyaar hai
 She says, i will direct a film
 main is par abhi kaam kar rahi hum
 Shooting will begin next year
 kendriya chunaav ayog ke ek faisle ne un partiyon ko bahut badi raahat di he, jinka pradarshan pichley loksabhaa chunaav main kharaab yaa bahut kharaab rahaa tha
 For parties like Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Communist Party of India (CPI), the Election Commission's decision has brought relief that now the decision regarding the national identity of these parties will be made in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 The latter will be done, because if the decision was taken according to the existing rules, then the national recognition of these parties would have ended
 rashtriya party hone ke liye kisi bhi dal ko kam se kam 11 siten jeetni hoti hai, jo alag-alag teen rajyon main hon
 The second alternative condition is that in the last Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha elections, four states have got 6% of the total votes and won four Lok Sabha seats simultaneously
 yaa teesri shart yah he ki party ko chaar rajyon main kshetreey party kaa darja hasil ho
 At present, apart from Congress and BJP, Communist Party of India (CPM), CPI, BSP and NCP have national party status
 2014 main bispi ko ek bhi loksabhaa seat nahin mili, ensipi ko chah siten to milin, lekin vot pratishat 1
 6 percent
 sipiai to ek hi seat jeet pai, or uskaa vot share ek pratishat se bhi kam rahaa
 The situation is that even after winning 44 seats in 2004, the identity of CPM, which is the largest party after BJP and Congress, is also under threat
 pichley dinon apni rashtriya party kii pahchaan ko bachaane ke liye yahaan chunaav ayog main kai partiyon ne apana paksh rakhaa, jiske baad ayog ne faisla kiya he ki ab rashtriya party ke str kii samiksha har do chunaavon ke baad hogi
 However, the basic rules are the same
 tippaniyan Apart from six national parties, there are more than 60 recognized regional parties in the country
 is manyata ke kai phaayde hai
 For example, a national party gets only one election symbol in the entire country
 party ke daftar ke liye zamin or bhawan diya jaataa he
 At the time of election, free publicity is given on radio and TV and during the election the cost of 40 star campaigners is not included in the election expenses of any candidate
 ab 2019 tak kai aise dalon ko raahat mil gai he, jinka pradarshan pichley loksabhaa chunaav main phiseddi rahaa tha
 Now whether or not these parties reach the door of power in the next election, they must have started trying to save their identity

 abhi congress or bijepi ke alaava marxvaadi communist party of india (sipiem), sipiai, bispi or ensipi ke paas rashtriya party kaa darja he
 In 2014, the BSP did not get a single Lok Sabha seat, the NCP got six seats, but the vote percentage was 1
 6 pratishat ho gaya
 The CPI could win only one seat, and its vote share was less than one percent
 haal yah he ki 2004 main 44 siten jitkar bijepi or congress ke baad sabase badi party rahi sipiem kii pahchaan par bhi khatre ke badal mandara rahe hai
 Recently, in order to save the identity of its national party, several parties in the Election Commission here presented their views, after which the Commission has decided that now the level of the national party will be reviewed after every two elections
 haalanki mul niyam jo hai, vahi bane rahenge
 The comments chah rashtriya partiyon ke alaava desh main 60 se adhik manyataprapt kshetreey dal hai
 This recognition has several advantages
 jaise ek rashtriya party ko puure desh main ek hi chunaav chihn miltaa he
 Land and buildings are provided for the party's office
 radio or tivi par chunaav ke vakt prachaar kaa free vakt diya jaataa he or chunaav ke vakt 40 star campeneron kaa kharch kisi ummidavaar ke chunaav kharch main nahin judata
 By 2019, many such parties have been relieved, whose performance in the last Lok Sabha election was laggard
 ab agle chunaav main ye partiyaan satta ke darvaaze tak pahunchen yaa nahin, lekin pahchaan bachaane kii koshish main zarur lagi hongi

 bhind ke jila aspataal main lage ek sisitivi camere ne jo kuch ricard kiya, use dekhakar kisi ke bhi rongte khadey ho jaaen
 The matter is going to surprise everyone
 buudhvaar, 13 disambar 2015 ko raat 12
 Time at 37
 aspataal ke meternity home yani prasooti grih ke baahar laga ye sisitivi camera chaalu he
 Is recording everything that happens in front of him
 chand seconds guzarate hai or is camere main pehali baar ek shaks kii tasviir kaid hoti he
 This man stumbles and sits in the waiting lounge of the Maternity Home
 thik aise, jaise ki wo sharaab ke nashe main ho
 Following him, another person also comes in the same style and sits next to him
 iske turant baad vahaan se ek mahila guzarati he or phir ek hi saath kai log meternity home ke vatting aria main aakar baith jate hai
 But after a few seconds, there is something so scary here that it is difficult to tell
 ab baahar kii taraf se ek or mahila bhaagti hui is vatting lounj kii taraf aati he
 Perhaps she is screaming or seeing her running, all the people present in this lounge fearing some danger, immediately run away from there
 ab raat ke thik 12 bajkar 38 minute or 09 second hue hai
 From the outside, a man of healthy stature, wearing a t-shirt and pants, rushes to the waiting lounge
 wo mud-mudakar kuch is tareeke se apane peeche dekhtaa he, jaise koi uskaa peechha kar rahaa ho
 His T-shirt is blood-soaked and upon seeing him it seems that he may have reached this waiting lounge to escape someone
 wo vatting lounj main maujuud shishe ke daravaaz se sidhe andar aa jaataa he or apane dushman se bachane kii koshish main shishe kaa darwaja band karne lagata he
 By then, another person is seen on camera following him with a gun in his hand
 lekin jaan bachaakar bhaag rahaa pehla shaks shishe ke daravaaje kii oot main chhupakar bachane kii koshish karata he
 But perhaps for a moment he has forgotten that the door is of glass and not only can be easily seen through it, but it can also be shot
 phir agle hi pal haath main bandook liye peechha karanevaala shaks shishe kii diwaar ke duusari taraf se bilkul kareeb aakar is paar maujuud shaks par firing kar detaa he
 The person who becomes a victim of the bullet, like a spin, falls face down on the ground by walking in the air and a torrent of blood flows on the floor
 ye sabakuch behad daraavna he
 
 lekin vaardaat yaheen khatm nahin hoti, balki kaatil or makatool ke bich abhi or adaavat baaki he
 Now the murderer comes in through the glass door and tries to target Maktool again with the same gun
 lekin shaayad bandook nahin chalati
 On the other hand, a man oblivious to all these things now comes towards the waiting lounge, but seeing all this, he too immediately returns back in reverse
 idhar, duniya jahaan se bedauf hamalavar chand seconds ke liye darvaaze se baahar nikalataa he or bandook ko thik karne ke baad phir se jameen par pade makatool kii taraf lautataa he or is baar bhi bilkul najadik se uski peeth par ek or goli daagta he
 Then he escapes the same way he came towards the waiting lounge chasing his enemy
 ab is live murder ke peeche kii bhi kahani sun lijie
 Actually this is the story of three friends
 camere par goli maarane vaala or camere par goli khaane vaala donon dost the, jabaki teesraa dost bhi isi aspataal main jakhmi padaa tha
 He is also shot, but before this accident
 use bhi goli kisi or ne nahin, balki inhen do doston main se ek ne maari thi
 It is strange to hear if a friend becomes thirsty for the blood of a friend and targets him with not one, but several bullets
 lekin bhind kii ye kahani kuch aisa hi he
 These two, who appear to have lost their lives and are seen to be losing their lives, are undoubtedly in each other's face, but according to the police, both of them used to be good friends of each other
 bhind ke jila aspataal main sisitivi main qaid hui katl kii ye vaardaat jitani daraavnee he, iske peeche kii kahani utani hi hairaan karanevaali
 According to the police, Maktool Vimlesh and Katil Dharmendra, along with a third partner Sanju, were drinking alcohol till a few minutes before this incident
 pehle to shahar ke chaturvedi nagar main sharaab pine ke dauraan hi teenon ke bich aapas main kisi baat ko lekar kaha-suni hui or phir gusse main aakar vimalesh ne sanju ko goli maar kar jakhmi kar diya
 But when Vimlesh realizes what he did, he himself along with his friend Dharmendra drove a third friend, Sanju, on a motorcycle to the hospital
 lekin sanju ke aspataal main bhartee hone ke saath hi vimalesh or dharmendra ke bich jane kya baat hui ki dharmendra achaanak vimalesh ke khun kaa pyaasa ho gaya
 After this, Dharmendra targeted Vimlesh first shot
 maut ke dar se ghabaraaya vimalesh lahooluhaan hone ke baavjood bhaagta rahaa or phir aspataal ke prasooti grih ke nazadik pahunch gaya
 After this, he tried to save his life here in the mirror door, but chasing him, friend-turned-enemy Dharmendra finally shot him and killed him
 aadhi raat ko aspataal main hui katl kii is vaardaat se log sakate main aa gaye
 But everyone should be surprised to hear this story of three friends
 kashmir main amarnath yatriyon par hue hamale ke teen din pehle jaish-e-mohammad ne ek tepe jari kiya tha
 In that tape, terrorists have spoken of carrying out terror attacks from Kashmir to Kanyakumari
 tepe main pradhanmantri modi or upi siem yogi kaa naam kai baar liya gaya he
 In which it is also said to teach a lesson to these two big leaders
 sansad or pathankot jaise khatarnaak aatanki hamale ke jimmedaar aatanki sanghathanjaish-e-mohammadane amarnath yatriyon par hamale ke 3 din pehle yani 7 july ko ek audio massej relies kiya tha
 In that audio, the terrorists threatened a terrorist attack from Kashmir to Kanyakumari in India
 is audio ko 'saad' naam diya gaya he
 The audio features the voice of Talha, close to Jaish Chief Masood Azhar
 is audio se jaanch agenciyon ke haath-paanv phool gaye hai
 There is a special reason that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have been repeatedly mentioned in this threatening audio of Jaish
 audio main bhaajapa sarkaar ko bhi nishaanaa banane kii baat kahi gai he
 In this, Talha has also tried to incite the Muslims
 aatankiyon ne piem modi or siem yogi ke khilaaf jehad chhedane kii baat kii he
 Militant Masood Azharka's close friar was the mastermind of the Pathankot attack
 usne uttar pradesh main bhi jaish kaa madul khadaa kar bade hamale karne kii sajeesh rachi thi
 But at that time the Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested several boys from UP and Delhi and busted their nefarious conspiracy
 tab khulaasa hua tha ki talha internet ke jariye aatankiyon ke sampark main tha
 According to the investigating agencies, many terrorist gangs are active in UP
 upi chunaav ke thik pehle bhi lakhanu main iesas ke aatanki kaa encounter hua tha
 In which many accused were also arrested
 jiske baad police ne unke hamale kii planning kaa khulaasa hua tha
 It was also revealed by those revelations that the terrorists had conducted a bomb blast trial at the Ramlila Maidan in Lucknow, close to PM Modi's rally
 lekin is baar maamla aatanki sanghathan jaish-e-mohammad kaa he
 The Jaish threat is being taken seriously by the agency because jaish-e-mohammed is capable of carrying out major attacks
 haalanki is audio ke baad se desh kii suraksha agency alert par aa gai hai
 On the night of 29 September last year, soldiers who have carried out surgical strikes against terrorists crossing the Line of Control (loc) have been announced to be awarded gallantry awards
 sarkaar ne ganatantr diwas kii purvasandhya par is team ke 22 javaanon ko puraskaar dene kaa elaan kiya
 These brave soldiers belong to the 4th and 9th Para Special Forces Regiment of the Army
 4 para ke ek major ko kirti chakra pradaan kiya gaya he
 The Kirti Chakra is the second highest award of the peace period
 teen afasaron or do javaanon ko shaury chakra diya gaya he
 Two colonels who were not involved in the surgical strike, but have been awarded the War Service Medal for their role in planning and conducting operations
 14 anya ko sena medal dene kii ghoshnaa kii gai he
 The comments ullekhneey he ki pichley saal jammu-kashmir main udi aatanki hamale ke baad javaabi karrwai karte hue bhartiya sena ke jaanbaaj ranbankuron ne niyantran rekha paar kar sargical strike ko anjaam diya
