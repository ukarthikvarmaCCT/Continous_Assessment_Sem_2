 Not only this, the lights in the tomb and the tomb were hung, causing damage to the monument
 is par ees ne samskruti vibhaag se is babat jawaab maanga jo vibhaag ne aaj tak nahin diya
 The controversy over damage to the monument was not limited to Tansen's tomb
 iske baad ees apane sangrakshan vaale har smarak kii suraksha ko lekar sachet ho chukaa he
 Says Shriram Tiwari, Director of the Culture Department, "ASI has started raising objections to the events of Khajuraho's dance festival to the palaces of Mandu, Bhojpur and the fort of Chanderi
 ''khajuraho kaa prasidgh nrity utsav yahaan ke pramukh mandir kandariyaa mahadev se 700 feet kii duuri par hota he
 Till 35 years ago, the festival used to be held inside the temple, but ASI feared damage to the temple, after which the event started outside the temple
 lekin ab ees ko is par bhi aapatti he or unhone mandir ke baahar us jagah ped laga die hai jahaan par manch banaaya jaataa he
 ASI officials have objected to the installation of lights at this place and said that this could damage the 1,000-year-old temple
 tiwari bhi maanate hai ki smarakon ko nuksaan pahunche, aisa koi kaam nahin hona chahie lekin saath hi ve yah bhi jodate hai ki lite isliye lagaai jaati he taaki logon ko becoground main mandir achche se najar aae
 Following a similar objection by ASI, the festival near Mandu's Jahan Mahal is being taken out of it
 bhojpur ke durg main saanskrithik aayojan karne par bhieesso ne etraj jataayaa he
 Basant Swarnakar, Deputy Superintendent, Circle of ASI, Madhya Pradesh, says that cultural events can be organized at protected monuments but it is necessary to follow certain rules
 ve kehete hai, ''samskruti vibhaag ne kai baar niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 According to Swarnakar, Tansen's tomb was damaged during last year's music festival, and no response was received when a letter was sent to the department seeking a response
 isliye ees ne pichley saal kii suraksha nidhi jabt kar lee thi
 This time the department did not even ask for permission and demolished the venue
 ''swarnakaar saaf kehete hai, ''jab tak samskruti vibhaag ees kii sharten puri nahin karegaa, tab tak aapattiyaan lagengi
 After all, these monuments cannot be rebuilt
 aise main aayojanon ko sabhi pahaluon par gaur karne ke baad hi anumati di jaaegi
 "at the moment, there is no visible middle path
 donon hi vibhaag sangrakshit smarakon ko nuksaan nahin pahunchane ke liye patibadghta dikhaa rahe hai
 But how much the change in the venue of the cultural festivals that have been going on for decades will fade and no effect is being paid to the atmosphere of that occasion
 karnataka vidhansabha kaa bajet satr shuru hone ke saath vipakshi dal bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne ek baar phir oparation lotus sakriy kar diya he
 This is the bjp's fourth attempt to destabilize the alliance after the formation of the congress-jds government in Karnataka
 bijepi ke is abhiyaan kaa centre mumbai kaa renesa hotel bataaya ja rahaa he
 This time the BJP claims that it has a total of 14 mlas, including 3 JDS mlas
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki oparation lotus part-4 kii kaman maharashtra ke vidhayak prasad laad ke haathon main he
 Prasad Lad is considered close to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis
 haalanki congress ne kaha he ki buudhvaar ko shuru hone vaale satr main 7 vidhayak shaamil nahin hue
 4 of them are rebel mlas
 congress kii taraf se vip jari hone ke baad shaamil nahin hone vaale vidhayakon main ramesh jarkiholi (baagi), mahesh ke (baagi), umesh jadhav (baagi), bi nagendra (baagi) hai
 MLA JN Ganesh, accused in the attack on Congress MLA Anand Singh, is absconding

 karnataka kii 224 sadasyeey vidhansabha main congress-jedies gathbandhan ke paas vidhansabha adhyaksh samet kul 118 vidhayak hai

 isse pehle do nirdaleey vidhayakon ke sarkaar se samarthan vaapasi ke baad bijepi ne congress-jedies gathbandhan sarkaar ko asthir karne kii koshish kii thi
 Under which all 104 mlas from BJP came to Gurugram adjacent to Delhi
 jabaki gathbandhan se naaraaz vidhayak mumbai ke ek hotel main bijepi ke sampark main bataae ja rahe the
 But this attempt of the BJP failed because the party could not muster the resignation of the mlas as per the requirement, which could lead to a no confidence motion against the government
 lekin ab ek baar phir vidhansabha satr ke shuru hote hi bijepi ne apni koshishen tej kar di hai
 bjp's effort is to persuade more and more mlas of the alliance not to attend the budget session
 bijepi ko ummid he ki inamen se kuch vidhayakon ke istife se jo maahaul banegaa usamen anya vidhayak bhi inkaa anusaran karenge jisase sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laane main aasaani ho jaaegi
 The BJP will need the resignation of a total of 13 mlas to create a situation of bringing no-confidence motion against the government
 vip jari hone ke baad congress vidhayakon ke paas do vikalp hai yaa to ve party ke saath khadey hon yaa ayogy ghoshit hokar apni sadsyta se haath dho len
 And then come to the Assembly by contesting the 'lotus' symbol
 haalanki pichhali baar jab congress ne vip jari kiya tha adhiktar vidhayak bijepi ke sampark main bataae ja rahe the unhone party meeting main shaamil hona munasib samajha tha

 Gehlot has expanded the cabinet, boards and corporations, but still maintains a dozen departments

 It is worth noting that Trump is a leader of uncertain behavior and every country in the world is struggling with the problem of how to deal with this temporary and irritable leader
 bharat bhi is maamle main koi apwaad nahin he
 Given the differences in trade tariffs, the unwillingness to understand India's close energy and historical relationship with Iran, and the proposal to buy India's S-400 missile defense system with Russia, everyone is curious to know if India is still America is on the priority list, as it was during the Obama administration

 Three ministers of Rajasthan government, local mlas, BJP state president Ashok Parnami and a few others were called to the RSS office of Bharti Bhawan in Jaipur last week to ask why they kept quiet when the temples were being demolished? Since most of them were from the Sangh background, instead of answering, they kept listening quietly
 darasal sangh or anya hindu sanghathan jaipur main mandiron ko tode jane or unhen duusari jagahon par le jane kaa jamkar virodh kar rahe hai
 On the other hand, if the administration does not remove unauthorized temples or other places of worship in the traffic, then its officials can be guilty of contempt of Rajasthan High Court and Supreme Court
 hycourt ke 30 june ke aadesh par sarkaar ko kuch hi dinon main kaaphi vyast bazaar raja park main panchvati cirkil ke paas sthit bhakton kii baari bheed vaale ek domanjila mandir ko hataanaa padegaa
 Not only this, a division bench of High Court Chief Justice Sunil Ambwani and Justice Banwari Lal Sharma has ordered criminal proceedings against those who build unauthorized places of worship within two months

 For the last two years, the resentment of the people on the issue of removal of temples was increasing, but the anger of the people exploded when six temples were demolished due to the proposed Metro route
 inamen se kuch mandir to 200 saal puraane the
 It would have been better if the owners of the temple had been given land and compensation elsewhere, so that they could build a new temple
 lekin prashasan ne sabhi ko ek hi jagah par shift kar diya
 Not only this, Jaipur Metro had used the services of a Mumbai heritage specialist to pay a hefty amount to save the heritage of the old city
 phir bhi hataae gaye chah mandiron ko unka mul dizin dene kii bajaae ek hi jaise mandiron ke saath rakh diya gaya
 Another reason for protest is that places of worship are not just centers of faith
 ve pujaariyon, maalikon or dukandaaron ke liye arthvyavastha se jude hote hai or yah dhandha mandir samitiyon, netaaon or adhikariyon kii mileebhagat se fal-phool rahaa he
 The demolition of temples is being done under the 'save Temple Heritage Committee'

 At the same time, the Congress says that the ruling BJP government is resorting to these organizations to save its skin
 in virodh pradarshnon ke peeche do vajahen maaloom hoti hai
 One, it has helped alleviate the uproar associated with Lalit Modi and second, to send a message to Hindus that bjp's allied organizations are fighting for the faith of Hindus
 sangh ne giraae mandiron kii tasviren apane nagpur mukchayalay ko bheji hai
 The issue of the unauthorized temple started under Congress rule, when Ashok Gehlot was the Chief Minister
 us samay 27 mandiron ko hataaya gaya tha, lekin anadhikrut rup se bani ek bhi masjid ko haath nahin lagaaya gaya tha
 Among the 73 religious places that have been removed during the current regime of the BJP, there are 8 mosques
 donon hi sarkaron ne dharmik sthalon ko hataane kaa kaam supreme court kaa aadesh milane ke baad shuru kiya
 In a survey conducted by the Gehlot government following a court order, 58,000 unauthorized religious places in the state were identified
 inamen 900 dharmik sthal akele jaipur main hi hai
 Government officials say that 10 percent of the religious places being removed are from Muslims
 is prakaar ve yah sakhti sirf hinduon ke dharmik sthalon ke prati hi nahin dikhaa rahe hai
 Most of the 73 shrines removed by the administration last year were mostly on the temple ring project
 pichley saal itnaa ho-hallaa nahin hua tha, kyonki ve mandir bahari ilaakon main the or zyada puraane bhi nahin the
 One of the main reasons for bjp's concern is that the Panchvati Circle temple is in the constituency of state president Ashok Parnami
 iske alaava hycourt ne agar yah report maangani shuru kar di ki pradesh main baaki bache 56,000 anadhikrut dharmik sthalon par kya kadam uthaae gaye hai to kya hoga? ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ''ham yah kaise kah sakate hai ki ham court ke aadesh kaa paalan nahin karenge? '' saath hi mantri nahin banaae gaye asantusht netaa bhi in virodh pradarshnon kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 "this issue was hot for a long time, but now it has become serious," says Parnami
 ''baharhaal, sangh kaa maujuuda virodh nishchit taur par pratigaami kadam he or adaalat ke samarthan se siem vasundhara raaje iskaa saamana karne main safal rahengi
 Though the Sangh may force them to make some amendments to counter the court order, it will not help in the long run
 adaalat sadakon ke nirmaan main baadhak anadhikrut mandiron, masjidon yaa girijagharon ko kanoon ke aade nahin aane degi
 The Sangh will have to think that if it does not oppose the demolition of houses and shops for the Ring Road and Metro, then how can they make so much noise about the removal of temples? florida ke hawaii adde par drugs ke saath giraftaar kiye gaye bhartiya mul ke america hotel vyavsaayee vikram chatwaal ko 56 hajaar dollar yani kareeb 31 lakh rupee ke muchalke par reeha kar diya gaya he

 com / zfjvjjmush The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) filed a petition in the Supreme Court today against the order of the Bombay High Court for lifting the ban on Maggi noodles in the country
 bhartiya khaadya suraksha evam maanak praadhikaar ne hoicourt ke 13 agast ke aadesh ko 'trutipurna' qaraar dete hue sarkaar se sweekrut prayogshaalaon ko phir se pareekshan ke liye die gaye namoonon kii shuchita par sawaal uthaaya he
 The FSSAI has argued that the High Court has 'erred' by asking the Indian unit of the Swiss company to provide new samples instead of any neutral authority
 isse pehle, hoicourt ne desh main megi noodsl kii nau kismon par pratibandh lagane sambandhi bhartiya khaadya suraksha evam maanak praadhikaar or maharashtra ke khaadya niyantrak ke adeshon ko nirast kar diya tha
 The High Court held that the principle of natural justice was not followed while imposing the ban, as the party producing the magi was not heard
 tippaniyan FSSAI sources said that the petition also sought to remove adverse comments made against officials of the food regulator
 isamen kaha gaya he ki praadhikaar ko sambhddha kanoon ke tahat prayogshaala main namoonon kii jaanch kii ijaajat di jaay or saath hi keval sarkari manyata praapt prayogshaalaon main jaanch par jor nahin diya jo ki sankhya main bahut kam hai
 The High Court had earlier quashed the order of FSSAI and Maharashtra food regulator FDA
 inhone desh main megi noodles kii nau kismon par roak laga di thi
 The High Court held that the principle of natural justice was not followed while prohibiting the noodles, as the manufacturer was not given a chance to hear its stand
 ethesaai ne daleel di he ki hoicourt ne kisi tatasth praadhikaar kii bajaay swiss company kii bhartiya ikai nestle ko hi nae namoonay uplabdh karaane ke liye kah kar 'bhul' kii he
 Earlier, the High Court quashed the orders of the Indian Food Safety and Standards Authority and the Food Controller of Maharashtra to ban nine varieties of Maggi Noodles in the country
 hoicourt ne kaha tha ki pratibandh lagaate samay naiysargik nyaay ke siddhant kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya, kyonki megi kaa utpaadan karne vaale paksh ko suna nahin gaya tha
 The comments ethesaai sutron ne kaha ki yachika main khaadya niamak ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf kii gai pratikul tippaniyon ko bhi hataane kii maang kii gai he
 It states that the authority should be allowed to examine samples in the laboratory under the relevant law and also not to insist on testing only in government recognized laboratories, which are very few in number
 hoicourt ne isse pehle ethesaai or maharashtra khaadya niamak epad ke aadesh ko nirast kar diya tha
 He banned nine varieties of Maggi noodles in the country
 hoicourt ne kaha ki noodles par roak lagaate samay naiysargik nyaay ke siddhant kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya, kyonki vinirmaataa ko uskaa paksh sunne kaa mauka nahin diya gaya
 FSSAI sources said that the petition also sought to remove adverse comments made against officials of the food regulator

 After David Ferrer, Novak Dukovic also made a big upset to beat the previous champion Roger Federer in straight sets to make it to the men's singles final of the Australian Open tennis tournament
 tisare variya srbian dukovich ne duusare variya federer ko teen ghante tak chale mukaable main 7-6, 7-5, 6-4 se haraaya
 This is the second chance at the Australian Open, while Dukovich defeated Federer
 isse pehle unhone 2008 semifinal main bhi switzraland ke is star khilaadi ko parajeet kiya tha
 He was then successful in winning his only Grand Slam title
 dukovich ab britain ke paanchaven variya endi marre or spain ke saatven variya david pherar ke bich kal hone vaale duusare semifinal ke vijeta se bhidenge
 This will be the first Grand Slam final since the 2008 Australian Open, in which neither Rafael Nadal or Federer will play
 duniya ke number ek khilaadi nadal ko unke hamawatan spanish pherar ne haraaya tha
 His fitness is not good, and now Federer's defeat seems to change the balance of power in men's tennis
 dukovich ne kaha, ‘‘vah aap par bahut adhik dabaav banaata he or isliye maine aakhri kshan tak koi dhilaayi nahin barti
 In fact, it was one of the best matches i played
 ’’ unhone kaha, ‘‘maine maukon kaa phayda uthaaya

 Mumbai's heavy rains are once again in the news
 shahar main barish ne jivan or yatayaat ko kaaphi prabhavit kiya he
 Things may worsen in the coming days
 vaise bhi barish se hone vaali bhayankar pareshaani ko mumbai ne 2005 or 2017 main dekh hi liya he
 In such a situation, walking in watery roads sometimes becomes our compulsion
 aisi hi sthiti main yadi aap car se chal rahe hon or barish main funs jaaen to in tips kaa dhyaan rakhen-1
 Prevent water in exhaust: When driving in the event of severe rains, first of all, understand the depth of water on the road, because not every car is an off-road car
 pani se labalab sadakon par dhire chalem or gaadi pehali gear par chalaaen
 Provide the accelerator continuously so that the water does not reach the exhaust and the engine is prevented from deteriorating
 2
 Leave the car: If the rain does not take its name and the water level rises, then park your car after seeing a suitable place
 car main bharta hua pani electrical system menshort circuitkar saktaa he, jo puure security system ko damege kar saktaa he
 It is also feared that due to technical flaws, the car may be locked from the inside as well as the windows may stop working
 behatar yahi he ki car ko kisi surakshit jagah par chhod kar nikal jaaen
 3
 aise toden khidki:yadi aap kisi takneekee khami kii vajah se aapaki car kaam karnaa band kar de
 In this case, try to leave the car first
 agar daravaaje naa khulen or khidkiyaan bhi band ho to khidkiyaan tod den
 As a precaution, a small hammer should always be placed on the inside of the car
 haalanki agar hathaudaa naa bhi ho to head rest ko kaam main liya ja saktaa he
 Adjustable head rest can be removed and its bottom window can be used for breaking
 khidki todate vakt duuri kaa dhyaan jarur rakhen
 4
 dhire drive karen:sthiti baadh jaisi naa bhi ho or barish dhire bhi ho rahi ho, tab bhi visibility or trection kam ho sakate hai
 In such a situation it would be better to drive slowly
 aisi barishon main ekua planning (chakkon par phislan) kii sambhaavnaaen bad jaati hai

 My cheap frame of Kianzer's glasses was too old to hang on the shoulder The bag was strangled
 My pocket was in the cheapest mobile yet
 He loved me
 Passed by a market, he refused to join us in his glamor
 In a beautiful park where my clothes and dirt began to appear, we did not have shiny packets of food from the public taps
 Drank water and loved it! -20173

 Chidambaram, former Telecom Minister A
K
 raja ke aaropon ko thukaraate hue kaha he ki ve chaahate the ki 2ji spectrum kaa aavanton boli ke jariye hi ho
 On the 2G spectrum allocation dispute, Chidambaram said that the Department of Telecommunications wanted to maintain the fixed rate for licenses in 2001, while the Finance Ministry was of the opinion that an auction should be held to fix the new rate
 chidambaram ne safai pesh karte hue kaha, unitech or swaan telecom ne videshi bhagidaaron ko spectrum nahin bechaa, pravartakon dwaara naye share jari kar unhen shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Promoters were discussed in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to include foreign partners by issuing new shares and Unitech or Swan Telecom did not sell spectrum
 chidambaram ne kaha ki vitt mantralay ne keval is baat kii parakh kii thi ki swaan telecom or unitech apni hissedari bech rahe hai yaa naye share jari kar apana hissaa kam kar rahe hai
 a few days after assuming power, dissatisfaction among Kejriwal government leaders is coming to the fore
 aam aadmi party se baghawat karne vaale netaaon main sabase pehla naam vinod kumaar binni kaa aayaa
 Binny has given an exclusive interview till date
 isamen binni ne apni naaraazgi jaahir karte hue mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal par kai gambhir aarope bhi lagaae
 Binny said that on the issues on which the party was formed, after the formation of the government, the situation of agar-agar has started coming
 kejariwal par aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha ki maine kabhi mantri pad yaa loksabhaa chunaav ke liye tikat kii maang nahin kii he, vahiin agar kejariwal aisa kah rahe hai to vah jhooth bol rahe hai
 Kejriwalbinini, who is trying to pass the time for two months, said that the Aam Aadmi Party was formed on the issue of corruption
 janata se vaada kiya gaya tha ki sarkaar banane ke chah maheene ke bheetar bhrashtachar main lipt netaaon ko jail pahunchaaya jayega, lekin aaj 20-22 din hone ke baad kisi ek netaa par cese tak nahin kiya gaya he
 It seems that the government wants to pass the time for two months, so that after the implementation of the code of conduct before the Lok Sabha elections, they will say what we can do now
 janata ke muddon se zyada ahm ho gaya he sarkaar chalanakejariwal par janata se vaadakhilaphi kaa aaropee lagaate hue binni ne kaha, 'aaj logon ke gharon tak pani nahin pahunch rahaa or sarkaar muft pani kii baat karti he
 The promise was 700 liters of free water, but you missed it
 yahi nahin aap 700 se adhik kharch par zyada keemat vasuul rahe hai
 No such thing was said then or in the manifesto
 yah janata ke saath dhokhaa he
 Binny said that it seems that the focus of Arvind Kejriwal has now shifted from public issues to how to run the government
 yahi kaaran he ki jis congress ke khilaaf chunaav ladaa gaya aaj usee ko saath lekar sarkaar chalaai ja rahi he
 Kejriwal did not have time to talk
 Vinod Kumar Binny said that his fight is on issues and he has been raising voice against it from the beginning
 unhone kaha ki meraa imaan paak-saaf he
 But today when Kejriwal has no time to talk about the issues, his attitude has changed
 jhooth bol rahe hai kejarivalbinni ne kaha ki unhone kabhi vidhansabha kii seat yaa mantri pad kii maang nahin kii
 On the contrary, it was Arvind Kejriwal who insisted on contesting elections from him
 yahaan tak ki LG ke paas paanch mantriyon kii shuruaati list main bhi unka naam tha
 At the same time, on the rebellion due to not being given the ticket for the Lok Sabha elections as desired, Binny said that Arvind Kejriwal himself had asked him to fill the nomination for the Lok Sabha
 aise main agar ab vah mujh par aarope laga rahe hai to vah jhooth bol rahe hai
 So Kejriwalbinni, while fasting for Somnath, has also accused Arvind Kejriwal of adopting different criteria for his people in the party
 unhone kaha ki somnath bharti par jis tarah ke aarope lag rahe hai, yadi vah kisi duusare dal se hote to kejariwal ab tak unke istife ke liye dharna pradarshan or na jane kya kya kar rahe hote
 But he is silent in the name of his party and his people
 unhone kaha ki jis tarah kii sthiti he somnath bharti ko swat: sangyaan lete hue istipha de dena chahie
 Arvind Kejriwal dominates ambition ambition: Arvind Kejriwal and party leaders are lacking in experience and ambition has come to dominate them
 unhone kaha, 'pehle sabhi ne kaha ki vah bangala nahin lenge, gaadi nahin lenge, lekin ab unki kathani or kerani main fark aa gaya he
 Kejriwal himself wanted to stay in a 10-room bungalow
 agar hangaamaa nahin hua hota to vah vahaan rah rahe hote
 It simply means that all this is his ambition
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ke liye abhi matdaan khatm nahin hue hai, lekin vipakshi dalon ne chunaav ke baad banane vaali har paristhiti se nipatane ke liye ranneeti banani shuru kar di he
 According to sources, the political parties and other opposition parties in the UPA will hold a major meeting in the capital Delhi any day after the seventh phase of voting on May 19 and before the results on May 23
 yah baithak 20 yaa 21 may kii shaam ko ho sakati he jisamen sabhi vipakshi dalon ke pratinidhi baithkar chunaav ke baad kii paristhitiyon par charchaa karenge
 Sources in the left parties have told Aaj Tak that this will not be a formal meeting but it can be called an informal get together
 is baithak ke sambandh main vipakshi dalon ke bich se hi prastaav aana shuru ho gaya he
 CPI MP d Raja said that after the end of the election, the opposition parties would sit informally and discuss the possible post-election circumstances, which is a common thing
 yah koi aupchaarik baithak nahin he
 Sources have also told that there will be no discussion regarding the post of Prime Minister in this meeting but after the results, when all the parties have a final picture of the number of seats, then the opposition parties will once again sit in Delhi and hold a formal discussion
 is baithak main sabhi sambhaavnaaon par vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 However, the same picture will emerge when the NDA does not get an absolute majority
 philhal is baithak kii taarikh tay nahin hui he lekin alag-alag vipakshi partiyon ke pratinidhi baithak ko lekar prastaav rakh rahe hai
 By looking at the opposition parties who will be attending this meeting, the blueprint of a grand alliance will also be revealed at last
 jaahir he abhi chunaav ke nattejey nahin aae lekin vipakshi dal bade sapane lekar badi-badi taiyaariyon main jute gaye hai

 Leader of the Opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav attacked Sushil Modi over the creation scam, alleging that government funds were transferred to the accounts of voluntary organizations, but the state finance minister was not even informed of this

 hamaare samaaj main aamtaur par damaadon kaa kuch atirikt sammaan hota he
 You can call it a special situation
 lekin usamen sirf ek shart he
 On the day the son-in-law (brother of wife's wife) started a mutual fight, started raising pigs from his father-in-law's antagonist or torturing his wife, his special situation ends at that moment
 haalanki wo damaad phir bhi bana rahata he
 The status of Kashmir (valley) was like that of the son-in-law, but rather like the elder son-in-law of the family, who also respected his small brothers-in-law
 main us baar-baar duharai gai kahani main nahin jaaoongaa ki maharaja hari singh yaa shaikh ne kaise vishesh darje kii maang kii or kaise bharat main unka vilay hua yaa ki ghati main ab tak sena or aatankwaadi ke haathon kitne log maare gaye
 The Government of India recently abruptly took away the special status of Jammu and Kashmir from the President's order in Parliament, though the injury is only the Kashmir Valley
 ye thik he ki 2019 main ye faisla aloktantric lagata he- balki he bhi- jisamen jammu-kashmir ke logon se ‘sahmati’ nahin lee gai
 However, fifty percent of the elected mps from Jammu and Kashmir supported the bill in Parliament, according to which the new system is going to be restored in the state
 us hisaab se dekha jaae to ye kahana galat he ki rajya ke chune hue pratinidhiyon kii raay nahin lee gai
 The elected representatives are not just legislators or members of the municipality
 saath hi yah kahana bhi puri tarah thik nahin he ki is par koi charchaa nahin hui
 Yes, it was surprise in this Parliament and there was less discussion but discussion is not just in Parliament
 ek mukhyadhara kaa raajnneetik dal or uskaa purv avatar pichley sattar saal se is anuchhed kaa virodh or us par charchaa kar rahaa tha or jis par hajaaron ton kaagaj range ja chuke the
 Strong leaders of the country had objections to this system both in the past and present, one of which died in prison during the reign of Emperor sher-e-kashmir, the heart of the same valley
 samvidhan ke nirmaataa dow bhimrao ambedkar, samaajawaadee raajnneeti ke purodha dow
 Many leaders, including Ram Manohar Lohia, were skeptical of Article 370 and had a different opinion on Kashmir matters
 kai netaaon kaa kahana tha ki yah anuchhed swaittata, prem, judaav or sadbhaavna kaa nahin, balki aniatikta, dhoortta or asabhyataa kaa dastavej he
 Many people went to jail on this article, thousands of meetings were held and thousands of seminars were held and thousands of walls of the country were painted
 aisa sattar saalon se hota aa rahaa tha
 But some mainstream parties and its friendly intellectuals remained silent on it
 unhone shuturamurg kii tarah naatak kiya ki tufaan to aa hi nahin rahaa he!bahut si baaten yahaan doharaav or bhatkaav ho sakati hai
 Here are four things that should be noted: 1
 vishesh sthiti kii lakh aniatik or amanviya baton ke baavjood use lagu kiya gaya, lekin desh ke pehle pradhanmantri ke shasankaal main kuch hi saalon baad sher-e-kashmir or rajya ke mukhyamantri ko raat ke 12 baje giraftaar kar jail bhej diya gaya
 Why did this happen? Because that leader of Kashmir was unfaithful
 pehla dhokhaa usee ‘damaad’ ne diya tha jo vishesh darje kii maang kar rahaa tha
 Jawaharlal Nehru may be praised or criticized for his political-economic short-sightedness, but his political generosity is also not opposed by his arrogant opponents
 shaikh abdulla to vaise bhi unke mitra the
 Then why did Nehru do this? Because Sheikh Abdullah had planned to liberate Kashmir with the support of the US despite the annexation of Kashmir in India and the government had strong evidence of this
 2
 Abdullah's act here was sufficient to abolish Article 370
 lekin nehru udaaramana the or apane purakhon kii jameen ko lekar bhavuk bhi
 The second thing was that India was a nascent democracy that used to ask for food from abroad, from grain to jeep
 bharat ko duniya kaa donon khemaa shaq se dekhtaa tha or bharat nirgut aandolan main duba hua tha
 Stress had begun with both China and Pakistan
 aise main, bharat sarkaar ne doosraa rasta akhriyaar kiya
 He introduced amendments to Article 370 the same way he was brought
 indira gandhi ke kaal tak uske bahut saare kaante nikaal die gaye

 bharat sarkaar kii ekmaatr spasht galati agar thi to wo thi 1987 ke chunaav main dhaandhlee
 To make Farooq Abdullah the chief minister, the Indian government rigged the elections and canceled the nomination of most of the opposition candidates
 ye vahi farrukh abdulla hai jo ab loktantr kii duhai de rahe hai
 The story after that is known to almost every youth of our generation and Kashmir has become like milk where all logic, all conscience, all humanity has ended
 yahaan par jaiprakash narayan kii vah baat yaad aati he jisamen unhone kashmir ko purna swaittata dene kii maang to kii thi lekin saath hi yah bhi kaha tha ki kashmir kii samasya sirf raajnneetik yaa dharmik samasya nahin he, balki yah bhugolic bhi he jisane use itihaas ke ek duruh mode par khadaa kar diya he
 If Kashmir had been near Odisha or Chhattisgarh and not there, it would not have been a problem like Hyderabad or Bhopal would not have been a problem after independence
 aise main kashmir kii vishesh sthiti se sattar saal main judaav kitna hua, yah shodh kaa vishay he, haa algaav spasht hua or uske liye shodh kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Here in this article, it is more appropriate to mention the Government of India and individuals, not taking the name of any party, because it was between the Orange Marriage 'indian State' and the people of Jammu and Kashmir
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke media salaahkaar rahe sanjay baru likhte hai ki koi bhi state (rajyatantr) tab tak apane vajood main nahin rah saktaa jab tak ki vah apane bhugol or sarhad ko apane tareeke se paribhaashit na kar sake
 Jammu and Kashmir and especially the Kashmir Valley had become a challenge to the outskirts of the Indian state and its existence as evidenced by nearly half a dozen direct wars and decades of proxy war
 congress ke kuch pramukh netaaon kaa kashmir main laae gaye taaja badlaav ko samarthan darasal usee indian state ko samarthan dena he
 Broadly, they are not in favor of the BJP or disregarding the Congress leadership
 aise main 1962 ke china yuddh kii ek kahani yaad aati he jisamen america ne jab bharat ko pratikatmak samarthan kaa elaan kiya to kuch america raksha visheshgy bhi aae the
 On the detailed map hanging on the wall, he indicated that the tank should be moved through the area which was then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh)
 bhartiya paksh ne kaha ki ye aniatik hoga, ye to pakistan he
 The American general said- "foolish man, your border and your country are being plundered and you still have morality"! i wish, the problem of Kashmir is like the backwardness of Bihar or the drought-hit farmers of Maharashtra
 aise main kashmiriyon kii ‘raay’ kaa mol hota
 But Kashmir is not a normal issue and its solution will also not be 'normal'
 jab kisi marij ko cancer ho jaae, to use bukhaar kii dawa nahin di jaati
 Those who speak of the opinion of Kashmiris, it seems that they consider only the people of the valley as Kashmiri
 unki raay main kashmir ke sharnaarthi hindu, jammu or ladakh ke logon kii koi ahmiyat nahin he
 And if this system was brought in like other Bills, could the nuisance and international pressure of that sensitive frontier have been sustained? Apparently, a 'throat bone' named 370 could be hunted only by ambush
 jab ghar main dakaiton ke hamale ho rahe hon to us samay bhaaiyon ke bich jaaydaad ke bantwaare par bahes nahin hoti
 People's paperwork and (sometimes not even that) opinion are taken behind making many laws of the country and despite the direct and indirect opposition of millions of people, special provisions for reservation and sc-sts apply in this country
 Have been happening aisa isliye hua kyonki usamen tark kaa bal tha, maanviyata kaa maraham tha or bhavishya kii sugandh thi
 Articles 370 and 35A prohibited everything that was related to universal equality, justice and freedom
 yahaan mahabharat kii kahani yaad aati he jisamen anuchhed 370 kii tarah hi kai log baari sambhram main ji rahe the
 The warrior younger brother got the throne instead of the blind elder, then the elder thought it was temporary
 lekin jab pandu kii asamay mrityu ke baad drishtiheen ko raja banaaya gaya to usne samajha ki ab yah vyavastha sthaayee he
 Then that king's system started oppressing his protected people and adopting immoral, inconsiderate and rude methods
 aakhirkaar mahabharat kaa yuddh hua jisamen krishna ne arjuna se kaha ki is aniatik or aviveki vyavastha ko khatm karne ke liye yuddh karnaa hi hoga or uske liye har tarika aajamaae jaaenge
 If you wish, you can say that an immoral and unreasonable system has ended in an unpopular manner
 kyonki loktantr sirf saadhan bhar nahin he, vah saadhy bhi he
 Let us be given a chance to connect Kashmiriyat and Indianism in a right way and a new era of democracy should be started there
 (punasch:-aaj ke kishoron main ek shabd prachlit he ‘friendzon’
 Kashmir wants Friendzone's relationship with India, whereas politics only has a relationship
 relationships main aap maalik ho sakate hai, friendzon main sirf saath baithkar pizza khaaya jaataa he)

 On one side there will be voters who have started voting after seeing their lives and on the other side there are leaders whose politics has slipped back and forth
 modi sarkaar puure paanch saal apni manaregaa ke avishkaar main juty rahi, jiske jariye 2009 jaisaa karishma kiya ja sake

 lagata he inaki nigahen ek andheri surang main feet kar di gayi, jiske chor par sirf chunaav dikhte hai or kuch nahin
 The way political parties used to make promises in the last decade, as the opportunistic alliances were formed, everything is the same today
 jabaki matadaata kahin zyada samajhadaar ho chale hai
 Leaders are always in a mood to insinuate that the voter regrets feelings, charismatic leaders and divisive politics
 lekin 13 pramukh rajyon main pichley teen loksabhaa chunaavon or is dauraan hue vidhansabha chunaavon ke nattejey bataate hai ki rajyon kaa jidipi yani aarthik vikaas dar gaanvon main mazdooree kii dar main kami yaa badhotaree matdaan ke faislon main nirnaayak rahi he
 Between 2004 and 2018, in states where economic growth or wages increased, the ruling parties got more votes and reversed when the growth rate decreased
 yahi vajah he ki 2018 ke pehle chunaav chakron main un rajyon (centre main bhi) main sarkaron ko dobaaraa mauka mila jinaki vikaas dar thik thi
 It is the urban middle class that determines the mood of political debates

 pichley do dashakon main yah pehla mauka he jab bharat main madhya varg ke liye rojgaar, kamai, khapat or bachat ek saath buree tarah gire hai
 Till Gujarat, the urban middle class that was with the ruling BJP came under the anti-incumbency wave in the subsequent elections
 25 saal ke aarthik udaarikaran main desh bhalee tarah se teen baaten samaj gaya he jo netaa nahin samaj sake
 One: The larger the market and the smaller the government, the more the employment will increase
 Two: Government spending is not an option for employment and earning

 But halfway, something happened to him that he kept hanging in the air
 stantman shailendra kaa tamaasha chal rahaa tha
 People were watching the spectacle
 kuch taaliyaan baja rahe the to kuch shor machaakar stantman kaa josh badha rahe the
 The stuntman had covered half the distance between this encouraging Afzai
 lekin iske baad jo kuch hua, uske bare main to kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin tha
 Needless to say that this spectacle of stuntman Shailendra proved to be the last spectacle of his life
 ricard banane kii chahat main wo ye stant kar rahaa tha, lekin jindagi kam pad gayi, saansen tham gayi
 Shailendra was rushed to the hospital, but everything was over before he reached there
 shailendra roy itnaa khatarnaak stant kar rahe the, lekin vahaan par koi rescue team maujuud nahin thi
 That too when Shailendra used to work as a home guard in the West Bengal Police
 police kamishnar se poocha gaya to unhone ise shailendra kaa nijee maamla bataakar pallaa jhaad liya
 According to Siliguri's Police Commissioner, Jayaraman, the program was in his knowledge but Shailendra was on leave
 ye unka koi oficial kaarykram nahin tha
 This stunt of famous stuntman Shailendra proved to be the last show of life
 jindagi kaa aakhri tamaasha sabit hua
 The journey ended before the destination

 Holi colors can be dangerous for anyone because most of the colors sold in the market contain dangerous chemicals

 Sometimes these colors and sweets can also cause miscarriage

 Archana says that if you want to play colors on Holi, then it would be best to use natural colors

 In such a situation, Union Minister and Republican Party of India (RPI) President Ramdas Athawale has said that AIADMK and BJP will combine in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki ve titivi dinakaran se milakar unhen ediemke main shaamil hone ke liye kahenge
 Addressing an event in Puducherry, Ramdas Athawale said that the BJP-AIADMK should contest the Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry by forming an alliance
 unhone kaha ki divangat mukhyamantri jayalalita ke sapanom ko puraa karne ke liye ediemke or titivi ko haath milaanaa chahie

 kanyakumari se bijepi saansad pon radhakrishnan centre sarkaar main mantri hai
 The main opposition party in Tamil Nadu for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections is an alliance between the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the Congress and the Left
 ek taraf rajya main vipakshi dal ekajute ho rahe hai
 So the ruling AIADMK is divided into three factions
 purv mukhyamantri jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad ediemke main netritv ko lekar jabardast siyaasi uthapatak dekhne ko mili thi
 Then it seemed that after the death of its leader, the party would disintegrate and so did it
 party teen dhadon main bant gai
 On one side was the faction of former Chief Minister o Panneerselvam, on the other side the faction of the current Chief Minister EK Palaniswami
 jayalalita ke nidhan ke baad khaali hui aarake nagar seat par jab upachunaav hue to is chunaav main ediemke or diemke ke aadhikarik ummidavaar chunaav haar gaye or titivi dinakaran is seat se vijayi hue
 The popularity of TTV Dinakaran increased further after the RK Nagar seat victory
 unke samarthakon ke bich unhen jayalalita kaa raajnneetik vaaris ke taur par dekha jane laga
 Seeing the popularity of TTV, 18 AIADMK mlas joined him
 iske baad vidhansabha adhyaksh ne in baagi vidhayakon ko ayogy ghoshit kar sadsyta radd kar di
 In such a situation, the distance of aiadmk's TTV camp was further away from the ruling camp

 In such a situation, when the Lok Sabha elections are on the head, the BJP will want a strong ally in the state to stand in front of the opposition alliance in Tamil Nadu, another state in South India, and the NDA can also grow

 yani vah kitna karj chukaane kii kshamta rakhata he

 ONICRA is considered an important rating agency in India
 ONICRA ek nijee reating agency he, jo sonu mirchandani dwaara sthapit kii gai he, yah data kaa vishleshan karti he or vyaktiyon or laghu or madhyam udhyamon (esemai) ke liye reating samaadhaan pradaan karti he
 If we talk about various credit rating agencies at the international level, then at present there are three big names in the rating world
 1
 Standard and Poor: The foundation of this rating agency was laid in 1860 by Henry Poor
 yah sabase puraani agency he
 Today, about 40% of the world's rating business is owned by Standard & Poor and Moody's
 2
 Moody's: Moody's was founded in the year 1909 by a man named John Moody
 3
 Fitch: The third well-known rating agency is Fitch; Which is a shortened form of Standard & Poor and Moody's
 reating or uske mynexa (highest safety): desh, company yaa vyakti nivesh karnaa sabase surakshit or laabhadaayak
 AA (high safety): The country, company or individual has great potential to deliver on their promises
 a (adequate Safety): desh, company yaa vyakti ke paas apane vaadon ko puraa karne kii kshamta par badali vipareet paristhitiyon kaa asar pad saktaa he
 BBB (moderate safety): The ability of a country, company or individual to deliver on its promises but more likely to be affected by adverse economic conditions
 CC: desh, company yaa vyakti vartmaan main bahut kamjor
 d (default): Country, company, or individual failed to return loan
 darasal agar kisi company kii reating, agenciyon dwaara acchhee kar di jaati he to us company ko bazaar se paise udhaar lene main pareshaani nahin hoti he
 Also, due to good image in the market, its stock is seen increasing
 isliye desh, company oe vyakti hameshaa acchhee reating kii khoj main rahete hai
 Why is a rating agency necessary? Since the 1980s, the financial system in the country became more control-free and Indian companies started borrowing more and more loans from global debt markets
 yahi vazah thi ki credit reating agenciyon kii raay yaa anumaan adhikadhik praasangik or mahatvapurn hote gaye

 ponti-hardip chaddha bandhu hatyakand maamle main giraftaar 45 varshiya namdhari ke farsh se arsh tak pahunchane kii kahani bhale hi filmi lagati ho, lekin yah raajnneeti ke apradheekaran or aparaadh ke raajnneetikaran kaa ek or taaja udhaaharan he
 Namdhari, who acquired the status of a truck driver to Lalbatti, was the personal security guard of current BJP MLA Harbhajan Singh Cheema from Kashipur seat in Uttarakhand till 15 years ago
 cheema khud khanan ke kaarobaar se jude the or unka bajpur ke van mafia or petrol pump kaarobaar se jude gurubachan laal sharma urf pandit sharma se jameen ko lekar vivaad chalata tha
 At the same time, the impact of Punjab's terrorism in the Terai region was at its peak and during this time Cheema's son was killed
 cheema ko shaq tha ki bete kii hatya ke peeche pandit sharma kaa haath he
 Meanwhile, on February 7, 1995, Sharma was shot dead and seven people, including Namdhari, were named in the murder
 aarope laga ki cheema kaa bharosemand banane ke liye namdhari ne hi gundon kii fouj banaakar sharma kii hatya kii he
 Namdhari soon established himself as a mafia in the Terai and reportedly built considerable wealth with the help of Cheema
 is safar main namdhari ke upar mukademon kii list bhi lambii hoti chali gai
 Bazpur police station has 12 cases including murder, dacoity, two in Kashipur and one case is registered in Rampur in UP
 lekin jab sharma parivaar or cheema ke bich sulah ho gai to namdhari ne bijepi netaa arvind pandey kaa daaman tham liya jo purv mukhyamantri bhagat singh koshyari ke behad kareebi rahe hai
 It is said that Namdhari soon became special to Koshyari and his hold on politics continued to strengthen
 isi dauraan ponti chaddha se bhi namdhari kii mulaakaat hui or ponti ne use haridwar main khanan ke theke kii dekharekh kaa jimmaa saunp diya
 But it was a political conspiracy that despite all the allegations, in 2006, he was not only made the chairman of the Sangh's subsidiary Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, but within four years, the Nishank government, along with the chair of the Chairman of the State Minorities Commission, got the status of the red light
 All the mlas of the party were opposing Namdhari except BJP MLA Arvind Pandey of Gadarpur in Tarai
 itnaa hi nahin, is dauraan rajya main do mukhyamantri badal gaye, lekin namdhari apni kursi bachaane main kaamyaab rahaa
 However, before India Today, Chief Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal says 'nishank', "the government is not one person
" namdhari kaa naam sanghathan kii ore se sujhaayaa gaya tha
 No such information was received about the name of Namdhari's criminal record now
 ” vidhayak pandey to namdhari se vyaktigat sambandhon ko sire se hi khaarij kar rahe hai
 He says, "being in the organization and being local, i definitely had relations, but not personal relationships
 unki soch or kriyalap hameshaa se sandigdh the, isliye main unase alag ho gaya
 Namdhari also opposed me in the election
 jisaki shikaayat maine haikaman se kii thi, lekin kuch bade netaaon kaa sangrakshan namdhari ko mila hua tha
 i had no business with Namdhari, my name is needlessly being linked to him
 ”lekin congress kii sarkaar aane par bhi fouran namdhari ko nahin hataane ke sawaal par vijay bahuguna sarkaar main mantri yashpal arya kehete hai, ‘‘sarkaar ne namdhari ko hataane ke liye puri prakriya apanaai he
 Earlier there was a demand for removal, but being a constitutional post, action is taken under a process
 ”bhale namdhari ke saath apana naam jodpha ab netaaon ko raas nahin aa rahaa, lekin bijepi tab tak uske saath khadi rahi, jab tak police ne use giraftaar nahin kar liya
 On November 20, Congress's Vijay Bahuguna government accelerated the dismissal of Namdhari as the chairman of the Minorities Commission, while state BJP president Bishan Singh Chufal and Leader of Opposition Ajay Bhatt defended Namdhari
 bhatta ne yahaan tak kah diya, ‘‘rajnatik vyakti par aarope lagate rahete hai, sarkaar ne barkhaastagi kaa faisla jaldbaaji main liya he, yah nyaaypurna nahin he
 "whereas Chuffal's comment was," He is in the party until the party proves something against Namdhari and the party is with him
 ” haalanki haituba machane ke baad bijepi ne 26 november ko namdhari ko party se nikaal diya
 But the whole incident only reveals the political penetration of Namdhari
 sirf uttarakhand hi nahin, uski pahunch desh ke saat rajyon main bataai jaati he
 Namdhari got a gun license from Punjab in 1985
 ponti hatyakand main naam aane ke baad namdhari se jude tamaam pahaluon kii jaanch ho rahi he, lekin uttarakhand main uski dhamak kaa hi asar tha ki bajpur police kii ore se 6 march, 2009 ko dm karyaalay bheji gai report main hathiyaaron kaa license radd karne kii sifarish kii thi, lekin is maamle main teen saal baad pehla notice march, 2012 main jari kiya gaya
 Almost every campaign that started against Namdhari has died halfway
 2011 main namdhari ke kressure par chapa maarane ke baad nikaali gai karodon ru
 The Revenue Department has not been able to recover till date
 ab to yahaan tak bataaya ja rahaa he ki jis passport ke jariye namdhari kai baar videsh gum chukaa he, vah bhi galat jaankariyon ke aadhaar par bana he
 The Delhi Police is also in touch with the police of UP, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Punjab to investigate Namdhari's immense assets
 ponti chaddha se namdhari kii mulaakaat 1996-97 main hui thi or vah jald hi kareebi ban gaya
 But due to his instinct, once Ponty removed Namdhari from his business
 iske baad vah jalandhar ke ek saansad ke sampark main aayaa
 He is also known as Dagbaaz in Bajpur
 kaha jaataa he ki cho vah cheema bandhuon ke bich manmutav kaa maamla ho yaa phir ab ponti chaddha or hardip chaddha ke bich chal rahe sampatti vivaad kaa, namdhari ne aise maamalon main khaasi ruchi lee or phayda uthaaya
 But during the shootout between the Chadha brothers, Namdhari was present on the spot
 is maamle main ab us par hardip kii hatya kaa mukadmaa darj ho chukaa he
 It is obvious that Namdhari knew the technique to move with the times, so in politics, he should be with anyone who remained at the height
 lekin rajnatik mahatvakanksha puri karne kii jaldbaaji ne use pahaad se jameen par laa pataka he
 —with Praveen Kumar Bhatt in Dehradun and Rupesh Kumar Singh in Bajpur mashhoor patrakaaravinod duaaka naam bhi # metoo main saamne aayaa he
 a female filmmaker named Nishtha Jain has accused him of sexual harassment
 fasebuk post main lagaae gaye nishtha jain ke aaropon ke baad dua ne 'da vir' par prasaarit apane kaarykram main safai pesh kii he
 Dua has given a week's delay to his institute 'the Wire' and asked to investigate the allegations against him
 unhone apane charchit sho 'jan gana man kii baat' se philhal khud ko alag kar liya he
 Following the allegations of Nishtha Jain, 'the Wire' stopped Dua's 318th show just before it was uploaded
 is sho kaa naam tha-jan gana man kii baat: rafel deal or telon kii badhati keemten
 Although the episode aired on the website on Wednesday, but with some censure
 sho main se dua kii wo baaten hataa di gayi jinamein unhone # metoo abhiyaan ko chunavi saal main logon kaa dhyaan bhatakaane kaa hatkandaa bataaya tha
 In the first version of the show, Dua has caught the attention of people that instead of talking about the real issues, the media is entangled in who sexually harassed them and that too many years ago
 dua ne sho main kaha, 'jo jo chunaav najadik aate ja rahe hai, jo- jo sawaal puche jane chahie, wo becoground main ja rahe hai, naa sarkari media naa darbari media unako uthaa rahaa he, or naa hi akhbaar unako uthaa rahe hai
 
 
 What is in the discussion is that who, how many years ago, whose sexual enhancement, or harassment, is being discussed
 
 
 jisamen centre ke ek mantri bhi shaamil hai
 a little mud has been spilled on me
 
 
 uskaa bhi main zikr karuunga
 On the allegations being levied under # metoo, Dua said, "the questions that should be asked from the government, which are completely hidden, in this whole debate, in this whole noise, who is being caught, or what But only accusations are being made
 'sho ke ant main dua apane upar lage aaropon par bhi baat karte hai
 He says, 'that mud has been spilled on me as well, such a mud is not of sexual beatification
 
 
 pareshaan karne kaa
 Dua said, '30 years ago some woman felt that i did something that made them uncomfortable
 ab ye aisa keechad he jo kisi padri ke choge par bhi lag saktaa he, jaj ke choge par bhi lag saktaa he, vakil ke choge par bhi lag saktaa he, pujari par bhi lag saktaa he, kisi sharif aadmi par bhi lag saktaa he, doctor par bhi lag saktaa he
 'dua said,' the mud has struck one time, so what can be thrown, what can he do except that he denies that it has not happened
 ' dua ne kaha- main, jo mujh par aarope lagaae gaye hai, unako sire se nakaar rahaa hum, khaarij kar rahaa hum, ki wo bilkul be-buniyaad he, kalpana he kisi kii, aisa kuch nahin hua
 But, because i am accountable to you, i am accountable to 'the Wire', hence from today
 
 
 is kaarykram ko suspend kar rahaa hum ek hafte ke liye
 Today is the 16th, on the 23rd i will again appear before you either to say my last goodbye, or to carry on the program so that this week which 'the Wire' has to investigate, if there is any investigation , If you want to know, you can live there without me
 23 taarikh ko aapse phir mulaakaat hogi
 Many women have made public the sexual harassment against them under # metoo

 agar ham aapse kahen ki britain kii maharani elizabeth ke ghar main bhoot rahete hai
 So you won't believe it
 lekin yah sach he
 These ghosts want justice
 maharani ke mahal main aaj bhi unke kadamon kii aahat saaf suni jaati he
 Yes, there is a sharp headache as you enter the room of the palace, in the palace even today the sound of ghost's footsteps is heard, where even today there is no blood stain from the room
 is hakeekat ko duniya ne sadiyon se mahasoos kiya he
 Scientists researched it and confirmed that there is some secret hidden inside the palace of the Queen of Britain
 yah baat landan ke barkidham pales kii nahin balki queen elizabeth ke ek duusare mahal hollyrud kaisal kii ho rahi he
 The castle is being held where the Queen still goes to spend a few moments of rest
 hollyrud kaisal, vah rahasyamayi kila he jahaan takreeban 400 saal pehle rahane vaali ek rani kii aatma aaj bhi apane maut kaa insaaf maang rahi he
 Even today, she does not let anyone live in that fort in peace
 kile main ghuste hi logon ke dil main ek anjaanaa khauf samaa jaataa he
 The capital of Scotland, Edinburgh, the part of Great Britain where the continuation of tourists from all over the world continues for years
 lekin yahaan sailaaniyon kii ek badi vajah bhoot hai
 The most haunted fort in the forts here is Holyrood Castle
 vah kila jisamen kabhi yahaan kii maharani rahati thi or jo aaj bhi britain kii maharani kaa scotland main sarkari nivas he
 But the world says that in this fort of Edinburgh, the souls of the old kings still remain and ghosts live with them
 ve bhoot is kile main khub dhammachaukadi machaate hai or ye baat kisi ek ne nahin kahi
 Rather twenty people have seen the same ghost
 baat 16veen shatabdi kii he
 Queen Mary, a beautiful queen of Bala lived in this fort
 1565 main unki shaadi lard henry se hui
 But within a short time Mary's heart was filled with Henry and he became close to a man named David
 raja ko rani par shaq ho gaya
 Henry tells Mary to elude the antics
 lekin meri nahin maani or ek din meri jab david ke saath shahi daavat kaa luft uthaa rahi thi
 Then some soldiers led by the king came there and they took David to another room and killed him
 kehete hai uske david kii aatma tab se insaaf maang rahi he
 Whoever goes to that room starts having headaches
 kai logon ne david ke bhoot ko dekhne kaa daawa kiya
 Later the king was also killed and the needle of suspicion went towards the queen
 rani mahal chhodkar faraar hui or ja pahunchi england
 But there too his troubles did not ease and he was beheaded for his involvement in the conspiracy against the throne
 raja rani or uske aashiq teenon kii atmaaen aaj bhi bolirud kaisal main bhatak rahi he
 Queen Elizabeth Hollirud Cassell of Britain
 yah kila jitna aitihaasik he, utana hi rahasyamay bhi
 Till date, anyone who stepped inside this fort must have had something strange happen to him
 kisi kaa saamana ruh kampa denevaali khuf se hua, to kisi ko ajibo-garib tareeke se chot lagi
 Most of the people aspire to see this building properly and leave the center and run away
 kisi ne kamaron se aahaten suni to kisi ko kisi rahasyamayi saayo ko ghoomte dekha
 About eight to ten years ago a team of scientists went inside this building to learn the truth of ghosts
 vaigyanik kisi nattejey tak to nahin pahunch paye, lekin unhone ne bhi yah mana is kuch naa kuch chakkar jarur he, jo har kisi kii samaj se pare he

 - input bhashaa On the allegations of Dr Sudhir Gupta, head of AIIMS forensic department in the death of Sunanda Pushkar, wife of Congress MP and former Union Minister Shashi Tharoor, the AIIMS administration has said that all the allegations made in this case are false
 ames ne kaha ki postmortem report ko lekar koi dabaav nahin daalaa gaya tha or sudhir gupta galat daawa kar rahe hai
 However, the AIIMS administration also said that at present there is no talk of removing Dr
 Sudhir Gupta from the post
 ames ke pravaktaa ne press conference main kaha, doctor sudhir gupta par postmortem report ko lekar kisi prakaar ke dabaav ke koi saboot nahin mili hai
 No pressure was put on them from our side either
 doctor sudhir gupta ne khud hi postmortem ke baad report ko silband lipaphe main daalkar esadm ko saunpa tha

 Harshvardhan said, after i became Health Minister, AIIMS doctor Sudhir Gupta wrote about his promotion to our department
 parantu mangalvaar ko tivi channelon ne kaha ki unhone koi aarope lagaaya he
 i have written to the director of AIIMS to give detailed information in this regard
 sunanda pushkar kii maut ke maamle main dilli ke police kamishnar bies bassi ne kaha he ki har pahalu kii jaanch kii ja rahi he or agar jaruri hua, to sudhir gupta kaa bhi bayaan liya ja saktaa he

 tharur ne apane fasebuk pej par bayaan diya, apni patni sunanda pushkar ko khone ke baad maine shuru se hi is maamle kii gahan jaanch kaa aagrah kiya he, jise jaldi se jaldi puri paardarshita ke saath puri kii jaae
 
 
 The Pushkar family is of the same opinion and we have fully cooperated with the authorities concerned
 main ek baar phir is lambii chaudee jaanch ko jald se jald nattejey par pahunchane kaa aagrah karata hum, taaki is maamle se judi sabhi atakalein tham jaaen

 ' i still stand for justice in 2012: Asha Devi India Today Group vice-chairperson Kali Puri pulled the length of welcome speech Dinaribhaya so long, it was very painful: Rita Bahuguna's 'aajatak' in Hindi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Ri on the dais with Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi in the first day of the eighth edition, 'aaj Tak Aaj Tak- Women Insecure Kab' Received Bahuguna Joshi said that women are not the only physical security but they should also protect the social and economic level
 7 saal pehle 16 disambar ko hi nirbhaya kii maut hui thi
 In the first session of Agenda Aaj Tak organized on the same day, BJP MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi said, 'nirbhaya died not only in India but the whole world was shaking
 us samay har kisi ko iskaa dukh tha
 Every woman must have been in tears
 pichley 50 saal se main mahilaon se judi samasyaon ko dekh sun rahi hum or unke adhikaron ke liye lard bhi rahi hum
 But such an incident should not happen
 maamla lanbaa nahin khinchnaa chahie
 'the judicial process should be expedited: Ritaun said that Nirbhaya's case was drawn so long, it is very painful and it should not have happened
 aaj sava lakh se zyada cese lambit hai jabaki mahaj 5 hajaar se thodaa zyada keson main sajaa hui he, baaki maamle abhi court main hi hai
 The case is stretched so long, people have faith in the judicial process, but it will not be possible to get justice quickly
 nyaayik prakriya tej honi chahie jisase is par lagaam lag sake
 Rita Bahuguna Joshi said that the biggest question is where does such crime originate
 jab ham apane ghar ke purushon ko mahilaon ko maarthe dekhte hai to ghar main maujuud bachche ko dikhataa he ki mahilaon ko maaraa ja saktaa he
 When a child sees violence from home and perhaps from there, this thing sits in his mind and perhaps from there violence gets filled in his mind
 unhone aage kaha ki kya mahilaon kii suraksha sirf shaareerik suraksha tak hi simit hoti he
 Along with physical security, women should also get social and economic security
 mahilaon ko teenon suraksha milane par hi sthiti sudharegi
 Social security will come if you get financial security
 saamaajik suraksha aegi to shaareerik suraksha milegi
 This work is very difficult, but it is very necessary
 isi manch senirbhayaaki maa aashaa devi ne kaha, 'mujhe insaaf chahie
 Somewhere even today i am standing there only in 2012 because justice is needed even today
 jawaab dete-dete, insaaf maangate-maangate main khud ek sawaal ban gai hum
 Asha Devi further said, 'what was Nirbhaya's mistake in the 2012 incident? hamaari kya galati thi ki aaj bhi hamen insaaf nahin mila
 In the 'agenda Aaj Tak' asks 'aaj Tak - Women insecure till' session Nirbhaya's parents Asha Devi and Badrinath, besides BJP MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi, Apna Dal President and MP Anupriya Patel, All India Mahila Congress President Sushmita Dev also joined
