 abhishek bachchan or aishwarya raay kii shaadi ko 12 saal ho chuke hai
 Both are considered as the power couple of Bollywood
 aishwarya raay kaa naam jahaan salmaan khan or vivek oberoi se judaa vahiin abhishek bachchan kaa naam karishma kapur or rani mukherjee ke saath
 However, in 2007, Abhishek and Aishwarya got married and surprised many people
 abhishek or aishwarya kii mulaakaat pehali baar saal 2000 main hui thi, jab ve film 'dhai akshar prem ke' kii shooting kar rahe the
 Both also worked in the film 'kuch Na Kaho' this year
 ab tak inke bich sirf acchhee dosti hi thi
 However, the two had met once before in 1997 when Ash was working with Abhishek's good friend Bobby Deol in the film 'aur Pyaar Gaya'
 donon ke bich 'kajaraare gane' ke vakt nazdikiyaan badhin or saal 2006 main relies hui film 'umrao jaan' kii shooting ke dauraan donon ek duusare ke kareeb aae the
 Abhishek had done Aishwarya in a unique way, propos-abhishek had told in an interview, 'I thought it would be fantastic if i could marry Aishwarya while standing in the balcony of my hotel room while shooting in New York
 abhishek ne bataaya tha ki us ghatana ke saalon baad jab 'guru' ke premier ke liye donon toronto main the, tab abhishek aishwarya ko usee balakani main le gaye or unhone aishwarya ko shaadi ke liye prapoj kiya tha
 Ash also admitted that Abhishek had proposed him in a peculiar way
 haalanki abhishek ne film guru ke set se ek cheez lekar unhen neuyork main prapoj kiya tha naa ki kisi beshkeemtee anguthi ke saath
 Aishwarya was very impressed with Abhishek's effort and got engaged on 14 January 2007 in Mumbai
 iske kuch samay baad donon kii shaadi hui thi
 However, it was also revealed that Ash is Manglik, so he was married to Vriksha before Abhishek
 iske alaava jahnavi kapur naam kii ek model ne bahut tamaasha machaaya tha ki abhishek se unka afaire tha or unhone shaadi karne kaa vaada kiya tha
 Jahnavi also cut his wrist on this matter
 haalanki ye vivaad jald hi shant ho gaya tha or ise sirf publicity stant bataaya gaya tha
 Historians have a different view on the controversy over the spying of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's family by India's first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 itihaaskaaron kaa kahana he ki ye sab nehru ko nicha dikhaane kii koshish he
 Let me tell you that the English newspaper Mail Today has claimed that Jawaharlal Nehru had spied Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's family by the IB for nearly two decades
 mail today ke is daawey kaa aadhaar haal hi main neshnal archive kii gupt suchi se hataai gai intelegence beuro kii do filein hai
 These documents of the Intelligence Agency claim that the first Prime Minister Pandit Nehru had spied the family of Netaji from 1948 to 1968
 in 20 saalon main se 16 saalon tak pandit nehru hi desh ke pradhanmantri hua karte the or ibi sidhe-sidhe piem karyaalay ke adheen hua karata tha
 When NDTV talked to Salil Mishra, a professor of history at Abendkar University in Delhi, Salil directly dismissed the allegation
 salil ke anusaar, ‘mujhe ye vishwaas ke laayak nahin lagata, kyonki nehru or bose ke bich duusare vishwayuddh ke dauraan jo vivaad yaa matbhed the, wo 1945 tak nipat chuke the
 With England and its Allied country winning the World War, the differences between Nehru and Bose had become meaningless and had ended automatically
 'salil mishra ke anusaar, ‘duusare world war ke dauraan nehru fasivadi takaton ke kilaaf the jabaki bose chaahate the ki bharat ko is ladaai main germany or japan kaa saath dekar samrajyavaadee britain kaa virodh kar bharat kii azaadi kaa maarg prashast kare, jisase nehru asahmat the
 During that time, where Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad and c Gopalachari were right-wing forces in the Congress, Nehru and Bose were the pioneers of their left
 bose or nehru ek duusare ke saath the, ve aapas main chitthiyaan share kiya karte the, apni shikaayatein karte the or is lambey saath ke dauraan donon ke sambandh main kaafii bharosa tha
 
 
 
 
 The differences were on political and ideological issues, and that differences ended with the end of the Second World War of 1945
 'salil kehete hai, ‘ek itihaaskaar ke taur par main ye jaananaa chaahunga ki akhir nehru kyon bose ke parivaar kii jasusi karwaanaa chahenge
 According to me, there has been an air of condemnation of Nehru in the country for some time, whose entire effort is to blame him for India's internal development, India's relations with China and other socio-political fabric
 'dilli ke hi satyavati college kii associat pro
 Neerja Singh says, 'I find this charge very childish because Nehru's stature as a leader and human being was many times larger than this
 ye aarope vahi log laga sakate hai jo neshnal movement kii pratishtha ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 Both Nehru and Bose were symbols of new awakening and enthusiasm in the 1940s
 ' ‘congress ke antim president ke taur par bose alag kism kii raajnneeti karnaa chaahate the, wo apana alag program chaahate the jiske liye unhen naa gandhi ji kaa samarthan mila tha naa nehru kaa
 Even Acharya Narendra Dev had then said that Bose wants to divide the Congress
 'is ghatnakram ke baad netaji ne nehru ko patr likhakar kaha tha, ‘socialiston ne meraa saath nahin diya iskaa mujhe dukh nahin he lekin aapane meraa saath nahin diya iskaa mujhe kaaphi dukh he
 'subhash Chandra Bose has always been an anti-colonial and nationalist but never had a mass movement, no question can be raised on his patriotism, just as on the loyalty of Nehru
 nehru desh ke logon se bhaavnaatmak rup se jude hue the
 It is Nehru's legacy that today there is so much freedom in this country that people are able to accuse him, while in his time he also succeeded in taking Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and Jayaprakash Narayan together
 1939 main jab bose congress ke adhyaksh bane tab patel, raja ji, gandhi sabane haar maan lee thi or tab bose ne unhen patr likhakar kaha tha ki main aapke saath rahoonga, sahyog karuunga
 But Gandhiji said that i run a people's movement, not my movement, whose
 
 
 
 
 
 i am just a general, you should run your movement separately
 neeraja kahati hai ki is samay centre kii sattarudh party apana ydal dhundne ke sankat se guzar rahi he or unke bheetar isko lekar kaaphi manthan ho rahaa he

 aisi hi ek ladki ne ‘aaj tak’ ko bataaya ki dere ke college main padhai ke dauraan kaisaa maahaul rahata tha
 According to the girl, she has studied at Satnamji College in Dera
 is ladki kaa kahana he ki dere main underground gupha hone jaisi baaten usne logon se suni thim
 But such things were never discussed there, teachers were only talked about studies
 jis tarah ab media main gupha or vahaan lage aadhunik systams ke bare main dikhaaya ja rahaa he, unhen jaanakar dar lag rahaa he
 The girl said that whenever Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh had to come to college, there was a big security cordon
 sirf khaas log hi unke paas ja sakate the
 Every year in August there was a program in which degrees were distributed on behalf of Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 saath hi scolership paane waalon ke naamon kaa elaan kiya jaataa tha
 When she studied there, a girl died of fever and a girl was also missing
 tab hairaani bhi hui thi ki bukhaar se kisi bacchee kii maut kaise ho sakati he

 On hearing the PIL filed by Israni and others, Chief Justice Arun Mishra and Justice N
 ke
 Jain's bench gave this order on 27 November
 yachika main mobile phone toweron se logon ke swasthya or paryaavaran par mandara rahe khatre kaa zikr he
 On the other hand, the report filed by the cellphone operators has emphasized that there is no evidence of any adverse impact on health, while advocate Prateek Kasliwal, who advocated the petitioners, said that there are many types of threats from them
 nyaayadhishon ne ehtiyaat baratate hue yah aadesh diya kyonki baad main khatre kii baat sahi sabit hone par usase hue nuksaan ko dur nahin kiya ja sakegaa
 Therefore, the court thought it better to focus on it now

 The association has termed the decision as 'disappointing'
 iske mahanideshak rajan mathew ne kaha, ''hamen faisle se niraashaa hui he
 Further action will be taken after we get the formal order
 '' industry kaa maananaa he ki vah bharat sarkaar ke maanakon ke anusaar kaam kar rahi he
 He contended against the court's right to hear the state special petition that the cell tower is a matter of jurisdiction of the central government

 He has also been asked to tell how many schools, hospitals and public places have towers removed so far
 hycourt ke hastkshep se rajya sarkaar ne report taiyaar karne or samitiyon kaa gathan karne main thodi tatparta to dikhaai, lekin is sambandh main cell operators par koi niyam nahin lagu kiya
 Pramod Kasliwal of reputed jeweler family is in Jaipur city due to the news of his brother dying of cancer and his brother getting cancer

 Many people there have been exposed to cancer
 sarkaar philhal aisi koi survey report pesh nahin kar pai he jo yah dikhaa sake ki cancer or cell toweron main koi sambandh he
 The High Court has therefore ordered appropriate compensation in this context and appropriate action to identify the true cause, ordering the attention of the Kasliwal case as well
 pratik kasliwaal ne haal main india today ko bataaya ki italy ke court ne cell toweron se prabhavit vyakti ke paksh main muaavja dilvaaya he
 He says that the tower was immediately removed from the neighborhood of Urban Development and Housing Minister Shantilal Dhariwal, but there is no such haste to address the concerns of common people
 unhone kaha ki na cell phone ke istemaal, na hi unase or toweron se jude jokhim ke bare main sahi tareeke se prachaar kiya ja rahaa he
 Israni told India Today that he is very satisfied with the decision and is looking forward to the day when the dangerous impact that the cell towers have on the life of the common man will be noticed

 Transactions take place in this bank too, but happiness is not about money

 The bank at Haldwani was started by a person named Praveen Bhatt
 is bank main koi bhi aam vyakti apane ghar main pade aise saamaan ko daan kar saktaa he, jo ab uske kaam kaa nahin he
 It includes every item including clothes, shoes, chappals, toys
 ek taraf aam log apane ghar main pade phaltu saamaan ko yahaan jamaa karte hai, to duusari taraf inkaa istemaal jaruratmand log karte hai
 Actually, the goods deposited by the common people are distributed among the poor people
 jaruratmand log yahaan pahunchakar apni jarurat kii cheez le jate hai or istemaal karte hai
 According to Praveen, he started this bank only when he was studying
 unhone bataaya ki vah garib bacchon kii shiksha kii khatir bhi kaam karte hai
 According to Praveen, about 12 thousand people have taken advantage of this campaign so far
 is kaam main aam log bhi unkikhub madad kar rahehain
 In the coming days, people leave the unnecessary items lying in their house here, so that it can be used by someone
 praveen ne bataaya ki yahaan se apni jarurat kaa saamaan le jane waalon se kisi bhi tarah kaacharge nahin liyajata he
 This not only encourages people to give, but the needy also feel free to come here and carry the goods they need without worrying

 Suddenly, the security of bank deposits has become an issue

 There is also a capital adequacy ratio, also known as the weighted asset ratio (CRAR) of capital and risk

 All commercial banks are required to conduct regular internal and external audits which act as protectors to avoid any major problems that may be long lasting
 ye tantra bainkon ko kisi bhi pratikul sthiti se nipatane main madad karne ke liye hai
 Are PSU banks safer than private banks? Traditionally, banks in India have enjoyed a high degree of trust of depositors
 haalanki, saarvajanik kshetra ke bainkon ('sarkari bank') ke liye suraksha kii dharna aam taur par adhik he
 "there is a general perception that RBI provides more protection to PSU banks than private banks," says Sourav Chakraborty, co-founder and CEO of Capital Coherent, a sebi-certified financial advisory firm
 haal ke dinon main, arabiai ne vyavasthit rup se mahatvapurn bainkon (esaibi) kii ek suchi taiyaar kii he jo bhartiya arthvyavastha ke liye bahut mahatvapurn hai
 If such banks fail, RBI will step in to provide a settlement option and protect deposit holders
 kai bade nijee bank ab is suchi kaa hissaa hai
 "currently, public sector bank SBI and two private sector banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, are on the RBI list
 haalanki, iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki kendriya bank chote bainkon ko bachaane ke liye kaary nahin karegaa
 Whether it is a private bank or a public sector bank, no Indian government or RBI will want to be in a situation where a bank goes wrong in front of their eyes
 jab bhi kendriya bank ko kisi bank main pareshaani kii kisi vajah kaa pataa chalata he, vah use dur karne ke liye turant sudharatmak karrwai karata he jaisaa ki usne lakshmi vilaas bank ke maamle main kiya tha
 If the situation does not improve, RBI usually allows it to merge with a strong bank
 haal ke dinon main arabiai ne aisa hi kiya jab global trust bank (ek chota-sa nijee bank) use sankat main dikhaa to usne ek piesu bank oriental bank of commers, ke saath uskaa vilay kar diya tha
 "finally, if any uncontrolled default leads to a banking collapse, both private and public sector banks will be subject to central bank action under the redressal scheme," says Chakraborty
 is samay, chaahe vah vilay ho yaa phir adhigrahan, jamaa dharakon ke liye jokhim ek jaisaa he
 "of course, one needs to be cautious
 vittiya shikshak, mani menter or finsphe ke sansthaapak, minna agarwal kehete hai, ''bainkon ke bich suraksha kaa str unki vittiya sthiti ke aadhaar par bhinn hota he

 But when it comes to cooperative banks, they have double regulation
 arabiai ke alaava, unhen kendriya yaa vibhinn rajya sahakaari samitiyon ke sambandhit registraron dwaara bhi viniyamit kiya jaataa he, jiske tahat ve panjikrut hai
 Naveen Kukreja, CEO and co-founder of Paisabazardotcom, says, "corporate governance and lack of professionalism are the main reasons for the weak health of cooperative banks
" dohare viniman bhi piemasi bank jaise shahari sahakaari bainkon (yusibi) ko aniyamittaaon kaa pataa lagane se bachane kaa rasta dete hai
 Co-operative banks do not have professional boards as their boards of directors are directly elected by the members of the bank
 vyavsaayik bainkon ke vipareet, sahakaari bainkon ko mukhya kaaryakari niyukt karte samay arabiai kii sweekruti kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 "as far as the regulation of these banks is concerned," says Kukreja, the RBI regulates normal banking functions while the registrars of cooperatives regulate the administration and audit of these banks
 '' yah doharaa niyantran, niamak dhaanche main kuch khamiyaan chhod detaa he
 The Finance Minister has reiterated that the ministry will change the rules to address regulatory loopholes
 yadi aisa hota he, to ham sahakaari bainkon main behatar viniman dekh sakate hai
 Insurance cover for deposits
 In the worst case, when RBI and then government fails to find any proposal and there is a stir in the bank, depositors have insurance deposit as the ultimate security mechanism
 lagbhag sabhi bainkon main yah suvidha he jiske tahat jamakartaon ko 1 lakh rupye tak kii jamaa par beemaa cover miltaa he jisamen mul or byaaj donon shaamil ho sakate hai
 Says Kukreja, "this insurance covers bank deposits up to Rs 1 lakh in case the bank fails, including fixed, savings, current and recurring deposits of every depositor
 diposit insurance and credit guarantee korporation (diisijisi) ke tahat shaamil or cover kiye gaye kisi bhi prakaar ke bank main jamaa kii suraksha ke str main koi antar nahin he
 DICGC is a wholly owned subsidiary of RBI with the sole objective of providing insurance cover to deposits and guaranteeing credit facilities
 haalanki, aise tareeke hai jinase aap ucch jamaa beemaa cover kaa anand le sakate hai
 You can split your deposit and keep it in different banks; Divide your deposits into different accounts in the same bank, which are held in different rights and capacities
 udhaaharan ke liye, khate ko ek vyakti, yaa ek sanyukt khatadharak, ek form ke saajhedaar, ek company ke ek nideshak, naaballig ke sangrakshak aadi ke rup main rakhen, phir ye sabhi khate alag-alag 1 lakh rupye ke beemaa cover ke paatr honge
 Increase Cover By 1993, deposit insurance cover was regularly extended
 lekin pichley 26 saal se nahin badhaaya gaya he
 Many people have expressed concern about how insufficient insurance cover of Rs 1 lakh was insufficient
 mrin agarwal kehete hai, ''yah dekhte hue ki keval 28 pratishat jamaa kaa beemaa hota he or duniya main sabase kam jamaa kaa beemaa cover bharat main he
 There is an urgent need to increase this cover
 esbiai kii ek haalia report main varisht nagarikon ke liye ek alag cover ke saath cover ko doguna karne kii sifarish kii gai he
 It is expected that the government will increase the cover keeping in mind the need for inflation and high safety net for small depositors
 bank kaise jamakartaon kii jamaa ko surakshit rakhte hai?sabhi sarkari or nijee bainkon ko bhartiya rigerv bank ke maanakon kaa samaan rup se paalan karnaa hota he
 22 of the total deposit capital of depositors to all commercial banks
 75 fisadi ke baraabar raashi vibhinn rigerv ke rup main arakshit rakhni hoti he
 It is necessary to maintain an amount equal to 9 per cent of the loan given by the banks in the form of capital
 In case of collision, the central bank puts a bank in the list of Prompt Corrective Action, which will help in the recovery bainkon kii sthiti main sudhaar na aane par rigerv bank ise kisi majboot bank ke saath vilay karne main madad karata he
 When all attempts to revive the bank are unsuccessful, in the end insurance of deposits up to a maximum of Rs 1 lakh is the ultimate security cover for depositors

 aaj subah mukhyamantri mahoday ne thekedaaron ke pement 24 ghante main clear karne hetu mukhya sachiv ko nirdesh die
 Sir, it is very sad that the Chief Minister is pressurizing the Chief Secretary to get the bills cleared by the contractors and not giving any instructions to the Health Minister or Health Secretary in case of non-availability of medicines in hospitals
 aaj maine abhi kuch der pehle teen godaamon main se ek kaa daura kiya jahaan parking ke basament main kai trek jivan rakshak davaaiyaan damp hai

 The Chief Minister is under pressure to pay for these medicines
 in dawaaiyon kii quality, istemaal karne laayak he bhi yaa nahin, inhen damp kyon kiya gaya, aaj aspataalon main davaaiyaan khatm hone ke kaaran kya he or jimmedaar koun he?aapse nivedan he ki mukhyamantri dwaara aaj kuch thekedaaron ke bill clear karwaane ke liye out of ve jaakar jo nirdesh die gaye he use bhi bhrashtachar kaa hissaa mana jaae
 Until and why these medicines were purchased, on what instructions, what is the quality of them and why medicines are not finished in hospitals today, till the corruption is not fully investigated, the bill should not be cleared under the pressure of the Chief Minister
 mukhyamantri kyonki swayan aaropee he isliye unke patron ko usee tarah se sangyaan main liya jaae
 Ever since the information about this scam has been revealed to the public, the Chief Minister has been continuously pressuring the Chief Secretary directly
 swasthya mantrico bachaane kii puri koshish he
 You are requested to intervene directly in the Health Department, the accused can be tried by the accused to destroy the files related to corruption and to give themselves a clean chit

 Apart from this, a list of 37 people was also sent to the Sports Ministry

 Batra said, "who will go, who will not, whose name will be included, whose will not, we do not choose (IOA)
" hamaare paas alag-alag khelon kii neshnal sports federation list bhejti hai or hamaara kaam us list ko sarkaar ko bhejne kaa hota he
 Our work is just like a postman
 bharat ke 222 athlete kaamanwealth games main hissaa lengepahale ek coach se kaam chal jaataa tha lekin ab boxing, kushti, badminton jaise indiviual khel main bhi sab apana-apana coach, physio, manovigyaanik lekar janaa chaahate hai
 Now if Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu want to take their father or mother along, then it is their wish
 kai baar unke jaise bade khilaadi chaahate hai ki kisi bade toornament yaa phir match se pehle parivaar kaa koi sadsy unhen hausala de
 There is nothing we can do about it
 222 athlete ke saath 74 adhikariyon kaa kharchaa sarkaar ko uthaanaa he or baaki logon ko jinke naam kaate gaye hai unhen sarkaar kah sakati thi ki wo apane yaa phir federation ke kharche par ja sakate hai

 jaraa sochie ki khilaadi ko agar inaki jarurat hogi to australia main wo kiskaa sahaara lenge

 'aapako yaad hoga kii sarita devi ko jajon ke kharaab faisle ke khilaaf apil karne kaa mauka isliye nahin mila tha kyonki vahaan koi manager hi nahin maujuud tha
 If a player faced any trouble in Australia this time, who would be responsible for that? In the absence of a doctor, what if someone gave the wrong cough medicine to the player and he got stuck in doping? The decision-makers in the government do not understand all this, it is very unfortunate
 jin logon ko khelon kii puri jaankaree he, agar unhen hi nahin jane diya jaayegaa to phir kya hoga?"is list main ek bhi tourist nahin hai-batrabatra ne kaha kii wo khel mantralay ke is faisle ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaaenge haalanki rashtramandal khel shuru hone main ab bahut kam vakt bachaa he
 "see, if the government had to cut the name, it could have asked them to go straight to their own expenses without increasing the issue
 ab kisi khilaadi ne kharaab pradarshan ke liye is mudde kaa sahaara liya to kya hoga? ioe ke adhyaksh ke taur par main ek baat kii garenti de saktaa hum kii is list main ek bhi tourist nahin hai

 How many people died in the devastation of Uttarakhand or how many are still missing

 Nobody is talking right about how many dead bodies are lying or who are still trapped alive, but Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna has made an announcement after which one thing is clear and that Those who are still alive should be revealed by 15 July
 varanaa wo chaahe jis haal main hon 16 july se unhen murda hi mana jayega
 The Uttarakhand government has announced that if the people lost in sky havoc do not return home for 30 days, then it will be assumed that they are no longer in this world and this 30-day period will end on July 15

 We have set the date

 It is estimated that more than ten thousand people have lost their lives in the sky
 kishton main kai baar samuhik antim sanskaar bhi ho chukaa he par ab bhi saikadon log aise hai, jinke saamne apane maut ke munh main samaa gaye par unki laashen nahin milin
 Will the Chief Minister, who fixed the date of death, say anything about the dead? dilli kii ek adaalat ne haryana ke purv mantri gopal goyal kanda ko aaj jamaanat de di
 The court prohibited him from leaving Delhi
 kanda airhostess geetika sharma aatmahatya maamle main aaropee he
 Additional Sessions Judge Yashwant Kumar granted Kanda's bail plea
 adaalat ne kanda ko paanch lakh rupee kaa nijee muchalaka or utani hi rakam kii do jamaanat raashi bharne ko kaha
 The court, meanwhile, directed Kanda not to leave Delhi without his permission and he has also been directed to submit his passport
 police ne sunwaayee ke dauraan kanda kii jamaanat yachika kaa virodh kiya
 Police said he could influence witnesses and tamper with evidence

 The Hindustani tiger is increasingly threatened by the Chinese dragon, as the dragon's hunger for the tiger grows
 china se tiger ke jism kii badhati maang hindustan main bachi baaghon kii 1400 kii aabaadi par sabase bada khatra ban gaya he, lekin china bharat ke tamaam agrahon ke baad bhi baaghon ke avaidh vyapaar par roak lagane ko taiyaar nahin he
 China is involved in the conspiracy: On one side, the world is trying to save this magnificent and powerful animal from ending, and on the other side there is the dragon who is constantly involved in this plot, how the tigers are eliminated from the world
 china ke rais ab tiger kii sharaab pine lage hai
 They have also started eating tiger kebabs
 tiger kii khaal apane drawing room main wo sajaa rahe hai
 He is making manhood enhancing drugs by strangling tiger bones
 baaghon ke jism kii bazaar main mangachini bazaar main baaghon ke jism kii maang lagaataar badhati ja rahi he auki jaise-jaise dragon amir ho rahaa he, hindustan ke baaghon par khatra badhata ja rahaa he
 In China, tiger traders buy tigers from illegal poachers in India at a nominal price
 yahi vajah he ki china hindustan ke baaghon kaa sabase bada dushman ban baitha he
 The most dangerous thing is that China is not ready to stop the illegal trade of tigers, despite the efforts of all the world institutions involved in tiger conservation
 china kii manshaa par sawaalhal hi main paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne china ke paryaavaran mantri se is bare main baat kii lekin chini mantri ke rukh se ye saaf ho gaya ki uski manshaa kya he
 India had demanded China to stop the trade of tigers and put a stop to a farm in the name of conservation, which actually makes the tiger trade illegal, but the Chinese environment minister has called the tiger trade illegal
 Connected to business
 china ne maang kii pehle bharat shahatush kii khaal ke vyapaar par roak lagaae
 China raised the issue of mulberry, although the fact is that India has already declared the mulberry skin trade illegal, but despite all efforts, China is not serious about tiger conservation
 phir tibet main paae jane vaale shahatush or baaghon kii tulana isliye bhi nahin kii ja sakati kyonki baaghon kii aabaadi ab puri duniya main sirf 4 hajaar ke aasapaas bachi he or puri duniya is shandaar jaanavar ke sangrakshan ke liye ekajute ho chuki he
 Tiger is also the national animal of India, while the population of mulberry is above 75 thousand only in Tibet
 jaahir he ki tiger kii tulana shahatush se karke china baaghon ke avaidh vyapaar ko rokane kii apni jimmedaari se bachanaa chahta he
 Concerns about tigers all over the world, when the whole world is worried about the dwindling number of tigers, and all efforts are being made to save this species
 china main baaghon par atyaachaar kii ek vajah china ke jyotish se judi hui he or isi vajah se aane vaale saal ke dauraan, china main baaghon par hone vaala zulm or badhane kaa puraa andeshaa he
 The importance of animals in Chinese astrology, the entire account of astrology in the horoscope is associated with the names of animals, just like Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, etc
 in our country, similarly in China there are mice, ox, tiger, rabbit and dragon
 The 12 animals are considered to be signs of zodiac signs
 china main har saal kisi naa kisi jaanavar ke naam par hota he
 According to Chinese belief, it is auspicious to use the animal in whose name it is Sal
 lihaaza log us jaanavar ke angon kaa istemaal karte hai
 Some keep skin in their house, some teeth or bones, and some keep the nail of the animal with them, and wish for happiness and prosperity
 2010 hoga tiger yearmaujuuda saal, yani 2009 china main chuhon kaa saal he
 Since rats are easily available everywhere and there is no shortage, nor is there a fear of their species dying out, but India's concern is the year ahead
 china main aane vaala saal hoga tiger year
 That is, in 2010, the people of China will link their luck with the tiger
 puure saal ke dauraan vahaan ke log baagh ke angon ko apane ghar main, daphtar main, yaa fir apni jeb main rakhkar khud ko bhaagyashaalee mahasoos karenge
 In a country with such a large population, if every man wants to keep tiger parts together, then obviously more tigers will be needed
 zyaada baagh maare jaaenge or iskaa asar bharat par bhi padegaa, kyonki bharat main sakriy baagh ke shikariyon kaa network china tak judaa hua he
 India's aggression may increase: India is worried about the victim of Bagh, the concern is also whether China will become more aggressive in the Tiger year than before
 darasal, china main manyata ye bhi he ki jis jaanavar ke naam par saal hota he, uske swabhaav kaa asar bhi logon par padataa he
 Since the coming year in China will be in the name of a tiger, then it is a legitimate question whether China will adopt an aggressive attitude like a tiger this year? China is doing this to show that it is a tiger that it can reduce tigers by tiger farming The number is increasing, but in reality it is completely different
 yahaan baaghon ko paidaa hi isliye kiya jaataa he taaki unhen bemaut maaraa ja sake
 Each of their parts can be negotiated
 china main desi davaaiyaan banane main baagh kii haddiyon kaa istemaal bade paimaane par hota he
 It is said that China does tiger farming for all these things
 bharat jaise mulkon se shikariyon kaa network bhi, china ko baaghon kii supplai karata he
 An international agreement was reached in 1981 to save the tiger species in order to save tigers
 samjhaute ke baad puri duniya main shikariyon par kadi nigaraanee rakhi gai, unki dhar-pakad hui or nateeja ye hua ki baagh ke shikaar main kaafii had tak kami ai
 China had also signed the agreement, but when there was difficulty in accepting the terms of the agreement, the next year i
e
 1982, China started tiger farming in this way
 janata dal unitate (jadyu) ke purv adhyaksh sharad yadav ne party or rajya sabha kii apni sadsyta par mandaraate sankat par apana paksh rakhte hue kaha he ki unki ladaai pad kii nahin siddhant or samvidhan bachaane kii he
 Yadav said on Wednesday that he has received a notice from the Rajya Sabha about the termination of membership, to which he will give a proper reply
 sharad yadav ne mangalvaar ko chunaav ayog dwaara party par yadav gut ke daawey par sangyaan nahin lene or rajya sabha kaa notice milane ke baad apana paksh rakhte hue yah baat kahi
 Yadav said that these legal aspects are being looked after by his lawyers, he is out of the big fight to save the Constitution based on the common heritage of the country
 rajya sabha kii sadsyta jane ke khatre par sawaal puchhe jane par bole ki 'ham pahaad se lard rahe hai to yah soch kar hi lard rahe hai ki chot to lagegi hi
 Saving membership of Rajya Sabha is a small matter, our fight is to save our common heritage
 siddhant ke liye ham pehle bhi sansad kii sadsyta se do baar istipha de chuke hai'
 Yadav made it clear that he is with the general secretaries, not in the Election Commission, but from the JD (U) general secretaries who have submitted their claims
 jadyu ke bhavishya ke sawaal par unhone kaha ki 17 sitambar ko party kaaryakarini or aath oktober ko rashtriya parishad kii baithak ke baad jadyu bade rup main saamne aegi
 Talking about his future strategy, Yadav said that he is on the path of saving the principle and the constitution and his opponents are on the opposite path
 unhone jadyu adhyaksh nitish kumaar par tanj kasate huye kaha ki hamaare 'mukhyamantri mitra' ne khud rajd pramukh lalu prasad se jab mahagathbandhan banane kii pahal kii thi tab bhi vah bhrashtachar ke aaropon se baahar nahin the
 However, after the formation of the Grand Alliance government suddenly broke the alliance in the name of Shuchita
 yadav ne kaha ki yah bihar ke 11 karod matadaataaon ke saath dhokhaa he, hamane sidwant ke aadhaar par hi iskaa virodh kiya
 Yadav said that we stand with principle and constitution and it will be fought from the platform of common heritage
 china ne doklam ke baad ab ladakh main bhi ghusane kii koshish kii, lekin bhartiya senaaon ne chini sainikon ko khaded diya
 After this, both the armies discussed this issue and said that this mistake will not be repeated from the future
 lekin is aashwaasan ke baavjood bhi bhartiya sena china kii chalbaaji kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar hai, bharat ko andeshaa he ki china kai or hisson main lagaataar ghuspaith jari rakh saktaa he
 According to sources, the eyes of China are now in the areas of Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh
 china barahoti or lipulekh ilaakon ko nishaanaa bana saktaa he
 That is why the army has been alerted in these areas
 haalanki sena se sanyam baratane kii baat kahi gai he, or kisi bhi tarah ke uksaave main naa aane kii baat kahi he
 The Chinese Army (PLA) may try to infiltrate from many places, but will think again before doing so in the sikkim-bhutan-sikkim area
 kyonki bharat kii sthiti is jagah par kaaphi majboot he, jo ki china ke paas chumbi ghati main uski mushkilen badha saktaa he
 But the way China can infiltrate the areas of Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal / Uttarakhand
 haalanki bharat yah bhi sochataa he ki kyonki tibet ke ek hisse ke paas uskaa hathiyaar, sena, air dephence ko banane kaa hissaa he isliye vah sidhe yuddh ke liye nahin jayega
 It is also because the front is open on Doklam from the eastern side and it will be difficult to open the front again from this part
 china lagaataar ladakh se lekamrunachal tak bharatpar dabaav banane kii koshish kar rahaa he
 Sources also believe that both countries want to settle the Doklam dispute before november-december
 iske liye bharat apane sainikon ko waapas lene ke liye taiyaar bhi he lekin china apni sena hataane ko taiyaar nahin he
 Let me tell you that the dispute between India and China over Kidoklam has created a rift in the relationship between the two countries
 doklam ke baad haal hi main khabar thi ki ladakh main donon deshon kii senaayen aamane-saamne thim
 However, the two armies met and asked to resolve the dispute by negotiation
 lekin chini media lagaataar bharat par hamalaa bol rahaa he
 Now China's TV channel has made fun of India and has counted 7 sins of India on the issue of Doklam

 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) He said that some political parties are giving unnecessary reason to the removal of the name of Taj Mahal from the booklet containing tourism map issued by the Uttar Pradesh government recently
 unhen samajhnaa chahie ki tajmahal kisi ke pyaar kii nishaani ke sivaay or kuch nahin he
 The former BJP MP said that Babur, Akbar and Humayun were never ideals of India

 He is our adorable and ideal

 Therefore, they have been kept under surveillance by the gun guards
 anshan tod agle saal manipur vidhansabha chunaavon main swatantra ummidavaar ke taur par khadaa hone ke unke faisle se logon main bahut uljhan, hairaani or yahaan tak ki rosh bhi he
 Human rights activist Onil Kshetrimayum, wearing a 'cancel AFSPA' printed T-shirt, says no one has the right to tell what Irom should do or to interfere in their personal affairs
 lekin ve maanate hai, ''unke chand samarthak niraash hai ki yah achaanak liya gaya ekatarfa faisla he
 "he is a famous man working between human rights and non-governmental organizations in Manipur who has worked closely with Sharmila and is a trustee of an organization created with her prize money
" unhone irom or unke goa mul ke british premi desmund kutinho ke bich sampark banane main bhi madad kii he
 Kshetrimayum says that when she heard about Sharmila's decision to break her fast, she was at first relieved, "glad that she is ready to move forward in her life and ending this mission like suicide"
 '' par raahat ke ehsaas ko chintaaon ne gher liya ki 16 saal se khaane kaa ek bhi niwala yaa pani kii boond liye bagaiyr jivan gujaarne ke baad aaj jindagi ke nae mode par ve kaise khud ko taiyaar karengi? unhen sthaneey manipuri raajnneeti main unke pravesh or bhavishya ko lekar bhi chintaa he
 Sharmila started a hunger strike 16 years ago in November and the decision to break it up a week ago is the same
 is lambey samay ke dauraan ve ek preranarot ban chuki hai
 Famous human rights activist Babloo Loitogambam says Sharmila's ability to surprise people remains intact, "years ago when she came to tell me that she was going on hunger strike, my first reaction was that it was very Difficult, you can't
 '' loitogambam kehete hai ki koi kalpana bhi nahin kar saktaa tha ki 28 varshiya shant-si swayamsevak irom itane bade sankalp ko nibhaa legi
 Irom had been working with other volunteers for months
 ve cycle se ghar-ghar jaakar gangrape, atyaachaar, marpet or hatya se jude tathy ikattha karatin or unki kahaniyaan taiyaar karatin
 His role in the fast was made when in November 2000, a troop of Assam Rifles was bombarded by an insurgent faction and the soldiers, in a spirit of revenge, gunned down 10 men standing at a bus stand in Malom
 
 tab yambem laba rajya maanavadhikaar ayog main the or jeeniemas ke ek doctor ne unhen kaha tha ki vah irom ko keval ek din or jinda rakh saktaa he
 It was only a few days after his fast and he was arrested by the police under section 309 of the Indian Penal Code for attempted suicide
 bakre jaisi dadhi vaale 61 varshiya laba ne doctor ko suzav diya ki sharmila ko nejal drip ke jariye khaanaa diya jaae
 Says Laba, "I told the doctor that if Sharmila dies like this, Manipur will burn and i will be the first person to commit self-immolation

 The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) came into force in 1958
 1972 main manipur ko sampurna rajya kaa darja mila or 1980 main ise 'ashaant kshetra' ghashit kar diya gaya
 Irom has become the face of the ongoing movement against AFSPA in Manipur due to her perseverance and patience
 2004 main thanjam manorama kii balaatkaar or hatya ke virodh main lagbhag 30 saal kii darjan bhar mahilaon ne nagn hokar assam rifles ke mukhyalay vaale kangla fort ke get ke saamne pradarshan kiya tha
 Those women had banners with the words "indian Army rape us too"
 us pradarshan main bhaag lene vaali kai mahilaayein ab sharmila kanba lup kaa hissaa hai
 It is a group of enthusiastic supporters who run their activities from the roadside huts near JNIMS
 yahi ve mahilaayein hai jinhone disambar 2014 main irom ke 'mangetar' kutinho par hamalaa bolaa tha
 Many of her supporters believe that Kutinho is actually taking advantage of Sharmila's loneliness and emotional instability stemming from years of captivity

 Nearly two years ago, Irom accused his brother Singhjit and other supporters of behaving like the Taliban and threatening 'honor killing'
 jeeniemas se kuch sankari galiyon kii duuri par ek saadhaaran-se ghar main rah rahe singhjit ateet jhatakane ke liye taiyaar nahin
 On his sister's decision to break his fast and become a politician, he says, "I am shocked like everyone else
" main aahat mahasoos kar rahaa hum or maa kaa bhi yahi haal he
 "most of Irom's supporters believe that they have sacrificed enough to remove AFSPA and now they cannot back down

 On the other hand, Loitongbaum believes that the movement to remove AFSPA, other than Irom, has taken root
 unka maananaa he ki raajnneeti main aakar ve ab tak arjeet apni naitik puunji ko khatre main daal rahi hai
 As far as the parties preparing for the assembly elections are concerned, the thought of the poster with the picture of Irom is giving wings to their dreams
 aam aadmi party (aap) ke armaan bhi machalane lage hai
 You are in need of Irom, his status, and the immediate identity through which you are running an office in Manipur from a cramped room behind a closed hotel
 irom ke liye 'aap' jitani jaruri he, usase zyada 'aap' ke liye ve jaruri hai
 According to analysts, the BJP can also provide a better platform for Irom's political ambitions
 par irom ke bare main is tarah kii atakalein galat hai
 He has taken a leap in an unknown direction, as he did 16 years ago
 yah ek saahsee faisla he, shaayad dussahsee

 When Priyanka Gandhi's name came up in the meeting, Rahul also denied it

 Recently he had met Sonia Gandhi's Khas Ahmed Patel and KC Venugopal, in which he said that he would not change his decision to resign
 party nayaa adhyaksh dhundhna shuru kar de
 On Sunday, Sonia Gandhi was elected the leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party, after which the UPA Chairperson said that the defeat in the election would not affect the Congress ideology

 This information has been revealed after the questions asked by RTI activist Hemant Gonia, resident of Haldwani
 gonia ne artiai ke tahat pradesh sarkaar se mukhyamantri ke kitne oesady or unke piaaro kii kharche kii soochna maangi thi
 In response, it was found that there is a team of 10 people of the Chief Minister's OSD and PRO across the state
 jinaki masik tankhwaah 60 hajaar se lekar adhiktam dedh lakh rupee tak he
 That means if the annual average is taken out, then it reaches more than 1 crore including salary tax

 At the same time, the Chief Minister is distributing millions of rupees as salary to 10 people

 He said that he would complain to the Chief Minister himself once

 Hemant Gonia said that even the Chief Ministers of the governments which have been in the past have not kept so much OSD and PRO

 Hemant Gonia has demanded a ban on such extravagance

 RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has said that before talking of new promises in 2019, Modi ji should tell the country what promises he has fulfilled in his 2014 manifesto in 5 years? Why are you shying away from talking on those issues today? What happened to those heavy sky promises, plans and announcements? Answer the questions of the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar
 tejasvi ne poocha he ki janadesh chori se bihar main bani palatimaar dabl ingine kii sarkaar se bihar ko kya laabh hua? kuvyavastha or berogari ke alaava rajya ke hisse kya aayaa? bijepi 2014 ke rashtriya ghoshnaa patr or bihar main 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main kiye gaye vaadon par baat karne se kyon sharma rahi he?unhone kaha he ki bihar ke liye vishesh rajya va vishesh package kaa kya hua? jab centre or rajya main NDA kii hi sarkaar he to ab bihar ko uskaa adhikaar kyon nahin diya ja rahaa? kanoon vyavastha, shiksha, swasthya, rojgaar, krishi, udyog jaise muddon par bihar aaj bhi rashtriya ausat ke sabase nimnatam str par kyon he jabaki rajya main pichley 15 saal se bihar main inhen jumalibaajon or palatibaajon kii sarkaar rahi he
 Tejashwi has asked why Bihar is still at the bottom of the country in terms of employment, while the so-called good governance government has been in the state for almost 15 years? Why have the statistics of planned crime, murder, rape, kidnapping got double engineed? Why are Nitish Kumar protecting the ruling leaders involved in corruption and rape? telugana kii rajdhani hyderabad main andhra pradesh police ke ek head consteble ne sah-yatriyon ke saath bahasabaaji ke baad chalati bas main firing kar di

 madhya pradesh ke vishvavidhyalayon main lagu semester system kaa kuch yahi haal he
 The semester system implemented on the lines of IIT has started to play with the future of students without complete preparation and fundamental changes in education structure
 is pranali main shiksha satr ko chah-chah maheene ke do satron main to baant diya gaya, lekin semester system kii ridh yani satat aantarik moolyankan pranali ko puraane mind set ke kaaran dhang se lagu hi nahin kiya ja sakaa
 It was amazing that the old system of two or three papers of one subject was abolished and only one question paper was made for each subject
 do yaa teen prashnptr kii ek saath padhai kar ek hi parche main use niptaana chaatro ke bas ke baahar ho gaya he
 This helplessness of the students is now turning into anger
 pichley dinon badi sankhya main chaatro ne ujjain kii vikram uniwarsity kaa gheraav kiya
 In fact, the recently announced result of bcom first semester of colleges affiliated to the university has been barely 40 percent
 chaatro ko dar he ki march main aane vaala biessi first semester kaa rigelt bhi mahaj 10 fisadi par hi na simat jaae
 Students say that long question papers and heavy courses are the reason for poor results
 vaise vishvavidhyalay anudaan ayog (ujisi) ne 2008 main pradesh sarkaar ko semester pranali lagu karne ke nirdesh isliye die the, taaki padhai ke liye behatar maahaul bane
 a government college professor says, "the higher education department's implementation of a single question paper system has increased mental pressure on students
 rigelt par isi kaa asar dikh rahaa he
 'although the state's Higher Education Minister Laxmikant Sharma argues,' the time taken for the examination and evaluation was too much
 use kam karne ke liye hi chaatrasanghon, praachaaryon or uniwarsity ke adhikariyon se charchaa kar ekal prashnptr pranali lagu karne kaa nirnay liya tha
 In future, examinations will be taken for private students from the semester system
 ’darasal, vaarshik pariksha se ulat semester pranali main puure course ko do hisson main baantkar chah-chah maah main pariksha lee jaati he
 When this system was implemented, it was argued that it would not burden the students and increase their tendency to learn
 vaarshik pariksha kii tarah hi semester pranali main bhi har vishay ke do-do prashnptr hote the jabaki rasayanashastra or ganit jaise vishyon ke teen-teen prashnptr hote the
 But in the single question paper system implemented from the education session 2011-12, only one question paper for each subject has been kept
 vikram uniwarsity ke kulapati pro
 T
 aar
 Thapak says in support of this, 'this system was implemented so that the exam is not too long
 salbhar pariksha hi chalegi to padhai kab hogi
 Earlier, the students were required to pass a total of 9 papers in a year by combining two papers each of three elective subjects and one each of Hindi, English and Entrepreneurship Development of the compulsory foundation course
 ab semester system ke antargat saal main do baar pariksha hoti he, yani 18 prashnptr hote hai
 Now in the applicable single question system, only one question paper for each subject has been kept
 isamen foundation course ke do prashnptr hindi or udhyamita vikaas first semester main or angreji or udhyamita vikaas second semester main rakhe gaye
 That is, now five papers have to be passed in a semester
 ek professor kehete hai, ‘uddeshy lambey pariksha kaarykram se or copy jaanchane ke bade kaam se uniwarsitiyon ko bachaana he
 Even if students have to pay any price for this
 ’chaatr netaa mohammad anwar kehete hai, ‘pehle ek prashnptr hal karne ke liye paanch-chah adhyay padhane hote the jo ab badhkar 10 se bhi zyada ho gaye hai
 "A professor says," The cuts that have been made to cover the course in a question paper have had a negative impact
 ’ ucch shiksha sharma mantri kehete hai, ‘may main phir manthan kar kamiyon ko dur karenge
 According to critics, the semester system can only succeed in fully autonomous institutions such as IIT where internal assessment is important
 devi ahilya uniwarsity (deavivi) ke kulapati pro
 Rajkamal explains the lack of this system, saying, 'the semester system is for continuous evaluation of students in which daily assignments are given, frequent tests whose marks are added to the result
 lekin yahaan to test kii vyavastha hi dhwast he
 In many places, marks are sent to the university without taking the test
 practical exam main bhi yahi hota he
 Due to this, the level of education is continuously falling
 ’deavivi main hi kulapati rah chuke dow
 Ashutosh Mishra says, "the semester system in the state is limited to conducting the exam in six months
 yah aantarik moolyankan ke apane mul uddeshy se hi bhatak gai he
 'that is why a professor says very strongly,' Higher education department has complete control at the graduation level, the course is preparing the same, so why the task of examination to universities? The evaluation should also be done by the department itself, otherwise the system will collapse
 ’ is baat ko pro
 Rajkamal says in another way, 'it is going on smoothly in the study centers of the university at the post graduation level because the question papers are prepared there, the assessment is there and the result is also prepared there
 ’shaskeey kalidas kanya mahavidhyalay main professor dow
 Says Vandana Gupta, 'semester exams are to be held in december-january, annual exams for students in march-april, re-semesters in june-july and supplementary exams for students in September
 aise main adhyayan-adhyaapan kab karaayenge
 'there are also discrepancies in the courses the state government has prepared for the single question paper system from the Central Board of Studies
 masalan, ganit ke teen prashnpatron main se pehle main bijganit or trikonmiti, duusare main kalan or tisare main sthitiki or gatiki padhai jaati thi
 Dynamics is missing from the new course, calculus and partial differential are placed in the second semester
 udhar, rasayanashastra main pehle semester main pehla adhyay hi ganitiya dharanaon kaa he jisamen aanshik avkalan or samakalan he
 In such a situation, in the first semester of the first year, students will be able to understand the chapters in chemistry and physics without reading the required chapters of mathematics in which these chapters of mathematics need to be understood
 aisa hi vaanijya main ho rahaa he
 In this, students are facing problems in subjects like accounting
 shaayad isliye haal main ghoshit parinaamon main badi sankhya main chaatro ko isamen jiro ank mili hai
 Professor at Madhav Science College, Dr
 ve
 K
 gupta kehete hai, ‘course main sikhaane kaa kram badal gaya he
 This is a big problem '' It is also an issue that in colleges where regular classes are not held, the ideal system like semester system, internal assessment and project work has not become an invisible system

 ham pakistan se pehle hi maang kar chuke hai ki vah daud ko hamaare hawaale kar de
 
 thodi pratiksha kiijie
 'earlier, Union Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju has also demanded Pakistan to hand Dawood to India
 unhone shanivaar ko media se baatcheet main kaha ki daaud ke taaja tepe se is baat ke pukhta pramaan milte hai ki mumbai bam dhamaakon kaa mastermindadaud pakistanke karachi main hi rah rahaa he
 Significantly, recently, 'aaj Tak' has narrated a tape of Dawood, in which he is also telling his whereabouts
 khud ko piem ke baraabar maanata he ki daudadaaud ibrahim ko pakadaney ke liye bhartiya khufia agenciyaan saalon se din-raat ek kar rahi hai, vahi daaud khud ko pradhanmantri ke baraabar taqatvar maanata he

 ’daaud ibrahim ne pehali baar phone par ye bhi kabool kiya ki vah karachi ke ghar main baithkar hi duniya bhar kii deal karata aayaa he
 It is clear from Dawood's words that in 20 years in Pakistan, the government has been so kind to him that he has started considering himself as equal to the Prime Minister of Pakistan

 The question of women's freedom and Nagarjuna's novelshridharam Antika publicationshalimar gardenghaziabad-5, Price: Rs 395
 nari adhikaar raksha kii ladaai kaa chithran nagarjun ne apane upanyaason main khub kiya he
 Women's problems, her rebellion and freedom struggle have been at the center of her novels
 stri swadhinata kaa prashn aaj bhi samakaleen he
 This has been investigated by the young narrator-critic Sridharam in the question of women's freedom and Nagarjuna's novel
 ve un paristhitiyon kii bhi padtaal karte hai, jinhone nagarjun ko apane upanyaason ke paatr gadhane ko prerit kiya
 It is not possible to understand the heartland of Nagarjuna's novels without understanding the feudal society of Mithila, the domination of Brahmins, Bikaua practice
 lekhak ne nagarjun ke upanyaason ke jariye asal main stri paradheenata ke vyapak aayam talaashe hai
 Nagarjuna believed that the narrative process of novels should be similar to the social process
 nari shoshan ko unhone bahut najadik se dekha or mahasoos kiya tha
 Therefore, it is not a coincidence that Nagarjuna has made the subject of his writing in both Hindi and Maithili the problem of women
 na to nagarjun ne kabhi kalam se samajhaita kiya, na unke upanyaason ke stri paatro ne
 The rebellion which appears in Nagarjuna and his characters, the same rebellious tendency is also in Sridharam's analysis
 nagarjun apane sahitya main baar-baar vivaah sanstha par prashnchikk khadaa karte hai
 In his novels he proves the irrelevance of this institution and emphasizes the co-life and co-existence of men and women
 unke upanyaason main swadhinata kii aakankshi striyaan samaaj nirmit varjanaaon ko laanghti hai, rudh manyataon se takaraati hai or antat apana swatantra astitv paane kii koshish karti hai
 Sridharam has put him in front of the readers with the same sensitivity
 nagarjun ke hindi main gyaarah or maithili main do upanyaason par pehali baar stri swadhinata ke sandarbh main gahan vichaar vivechan kiya gaya he
 Nagarjuna's female sensations can be understood very well through this book
 unke janm shatabdi varsh main iskaa prakaashan ek uplabdhi he
 It is not only an important book to understand the question of women's freedom in his novels

 kisi khilaadi kii jeet par jashn khilaadi kii tarah manaaya janaa chahie
 That game should be celebrated, not as a slogan for diagnosing India's social problems
 pivi sindhu kii jeet kaa jashn ham isi tarah manaanaa pasand karenge
 Are also celebrating kal tak jaise baluchistan ke bare main pataa nahin tha usee tarah badminton ke bare main bhi kam jaanate the, magar pivi sindhu ke khel se laga ki is khel ke ham bhi kabhi champion hone vaale rahe honge lekin pratiyogita se thik pehle skool bas miss ho gai thi
 When Sindhu was playing, we all rode on her wide shoulders
 vah bhi ham sab nakaaron ko laade hue masti main shot par shot maare ja rahi thi
 Japan is also one of the medal winning countries
 ekaadh game main na bhi jite to kya fark padataa he? aisa hi laga jab maine sindhu ke saamne japan kii khilaadi ko khelte dekha
 There was no weight on her shoulder, so she stumbled in front of Sindhu's shot
 sindhu ham sabakaa bhaar uthaae khadi rah gai
 As soon as Sindhu won, we all got off her shoulder and started running around, dancing and singing
 aisa laga ki 'sindhu raashtra' kaa sapana saakaar ho gaya he or ab 'sa' ko 'ha' nahin 'sa' hi padhaa ja rahaa he! pivi sindhu kii jeet par vishaal 'gaurav sena' maidan main utar ai he or jamkar gauravgaan hone laga
 There was a wave of congratulations
 ham aise jhume jaise sindhu kii jeet ke peeche sadiyon se gaanv gali main bikhri padi khel suvidhaon kaa haath he
 Badminton players are found in India

 gopichand baahar aate hai or hamen shasip kehete hue hamaari maang ko thukraa dete hai
 On asking the reason, i say that i do not want to advertise Coke, so i do not want Bharat Ratna

 tippaniyan My compatriots, i have a request for you
 sindhu or sakshi kii jeet par vijeta kii tarah naacho lekin uske bahaane bich-bich main sarkari or saamaajik yojanaon ke slogan mat thelo
 On the same social media, someone is saying 'beti Bachao', 'beti Padhao Ki Jai', some are declaring these players as sisters and some are telling the gift of a sister on Rakshabandhan and some sex ratio figures
 hazaraat
 
 
 Their success is not the success of any government scheme
 na hi inaki jeet se hamaara samaaj raaton raat sudhar jane vaala he
 If this is going to happen, then present before us the report card of the change in the society about girls after the success of PT Usha
 jab ham piti usha ke baad nahin sudhare to sindhu ke baad kaise sudhar jaaenge? i am sure that the people dancing to the success of Sindhu and Sakshi will not bring Sindhu or Sakshi from tomorrow when they go to see daughter-in-law for their sons because such daughters do not come with dowry
 mujhe yah bhi yakeen he ki nabbe fisadi mata-pita is josh main bhi dahej kaa nuksaan nahin uthaaenge
 i am sure that ninety percent of our youth will not break the tradition of Indian culture of obeying their father by forbidding their parents to take dowry
 isliye mitro sindhu or sakshi kii jeet kaa jashn 'gilt free' yani aparadhbodh mukt hokar manaaen
 If you have won now, get off the shoulder of Sindhu
 uske kandhe par yojanaon ke slogan mat laadie
 Consider this victory as a victory for a player's practice
 
 Sing 
 
 jai sindhu, jai sakshi, jai hind
 When Sindhu was playing, we all rode on her wide shoulders

 haa ab to bijli bhi sarplus he isliye sau wat ke balb kii jagah flud lite lagaakar khelenge
 There will be noise of indoor-outdoor badminton
 
 
 sabar karo
 
 
 Everything will happen
 tippaniyan My compatriots, i have a request for you
 sindhu or sakshi kii jeet par vijeta kii tarah naacho lekin uske bahaane bich-bich main sarkari or saamaajik yojanaon ke slogan mat thelo
 On the same social media, someone is saying ' Beti Bachao', 'beti Padhao Ki Jai', someone is declaring these players as ' Sister' and some are telling the gift of sister on Rakshabandhan and some sex ratio figures
 hazaraat
 
 
 Their success is not the success of any government scheme
 na hi inaki jeet se hamaara samaaj raaton raat sudhar jane vaala he
 If this is going to happen, then present before us the report card of the change in the society about girls after the success of PT Usha
 jab ham piti usha ke baad nahin sudhare to sindhu ke baad kaise sudhar jaaenge? i am sure that the people dancing to the success of Sindhu and Sakshi will not bring Sindhu or Sakshi from tomorrow when they go to see daughter-in-law for their sons because such daughters do not come with dowry
 mujhe yah bhi yakeen he ki nabbe fisadi mata-pita is josh main bhi dahej kaa nuksaan nahin uthaaenge
 i am sure that ninety percent of our youth will not break the tradition of Indian culture of obeying their father by forbidding their parents to take dowry
 isliye mitro sindhu or sakshi kii jeet kaa jashn 'gilt free' yani aparadhbodh mukt hokar manaaen
 If you have won now, get off the shoulder of Sindhu
 uske kandhe par yojanaon ke slogan mat laadie
 Consider this victory as a victory for a player's practice
 
 Sing 
 
 jai sindhu, jai sakshi, jai hind
 As soon as Sindhu won, we all got off her shoulder and started running around, dancing and singing
 aisa laga ki 'sindhu raashtra' kaa sapana saakaar ho gaya he or ab 'sa' ko 'ha' nahin 'sa' hi padhaa ja rahaa he! pivi sindhu kii jeet par vishaal 'gaurav sena' maidan main utar ai he or jamkar gauravgaan hone laga
 There was a wave of congratulations
 ham aise jhume jaise sindhu kii jeet ke peeche sadiyon se gaanv gali main bikhri padi khel suvidhaon kaa haath he
 Badminton players are found in India
 din bhar daftar kii thakaan or tond ke ubhaar se mukti paane ke liye gymkhana se lekar chitakhaana club tak main khilne vaale pivi sindhu ke purvaj or sahacharon ke punya pratap or aashirwad se sindhu jiti he
 In the very last budget, India has been declared as the band-head nation
 imtahaanon main niabandh likhte-likhte chaatr agali pankti main machal uthta he ki bharat hi vah mulk jahaan khel mantri na banane par raksha mantri istipha de dete hai! We swear by Deepa that we will take revenge for Babita's defeat, considering Sindhu as a partner, but we are very happy at the moment and want to shower flowers on Pullela Gopichand by Pushpak aircraft but due to night, air traffic control does not allow Granted, we sit on a dharna and demand Bharat Ratna to Gopichand
 gopichand baahar aate hai or hamen shasip kehete hue hamaari maang ko thukraa dete hai
 On asking the reason, i say that i do not want to advertise Coke, so i do not want Bharat Ratna
 aisa coach kisi badminton pradhan desh main hi ho saktaa he
 So leaving Mang-wang, we start again
 pivi sindhu kii jeet hamaari jeet he
 This coming winter, we will start practice by stretching the net in the parking lot and encroach elsewhere for parking
 haa ab to bijli bhi sarplus he isliye sau wat ke balb kii jagah flud lite lagaakar khelenge

 bhartiya cricket control board (BCCI) ke adhyakinurag thakurki museebataan bad sakati hai
 During the hearing on the BCCI reform case, Chief Justice T
 es thakur ne kaha ki anuraag thakur par court kii avmaananaa kaa cese chalaaya ja saktaa he or vah jail bhi ja sakate hai
 Anurag Thakur asked that the Supreme Court during the hearing of the case asked Amicus Curiae (justice friend) Gopal Subramaniam whether a case was made against BCCI President Anurag Thakur for giving false evidence in Parjuri i
e
 court or not
 Subramanian said in his reply that this is the case on Thakur
 isse naaraaz chif justise thakur ne sakht rukh apanaate hue anuraag thakur par avmaananaa kaa cese chalaane or thakur samet board ke ucch adhikariyon ko hataane kii chetavanee di
 However, the court has reserved order in this case and it is expected that a verdict can be delivered on 2 or 3 January
 thakur par sudhaar prakriya main baadha pahunchane kaa aropadarasal maamla yah he ki shashaank manohar jab bisisiai adhyaksh the, tab unhone kaha tha ki bisisiai main sieji kaa namankit afasar sarkaar kaa dakhal mana jayega or iske chalate bisisiai, isisi kii sadsyta ko kho degi
 Later, when Manohar became the chairman of the ICC, Anurag Thakur wrote a letter to him to explain the situation, but Manohar refused to do so, saying that the matter was pending in court
 is par anuraag ne court main aakar kaha ki unhone is aashay kii chitthee maangi hi nahin
 On this, Amicus Curie Subramanian said that these two things are different
 thakur ne sudhaar prakriya main baadha pahunchaai he, lihaaja un par parajuri kaa maamla banataa he
 The Lodha Committee has put forward several proposals for reforms in the BCCI that the Lodha Committee wants to completely change the BCCI outline

 Several amendments were introduced to change the existing law on the sale of liquor in the state
 jisamen se yogi sarkaar ne pichley saal sitambar main exise act 1910 main sanshodhan kiya tha, taaki padosi rajyon se sharaab ke aayaat kii jaanch kii ja sake
 Under the new law amended by the Yogi government, if a person enters Uttar Pradesh with more than one sealed bottle of liquor from any other state, then he / she may face police investigation
 bataa den ki, noida or gajiabad ke logon dwaara dilli se sasti daron par sharaab khareednaa aam baat he
 According to the new law, supplying liquor from another state to UP would be considered a non-bailable offense and a person carrying liquor could face a fine of Rs 5000 as well as a maximum jail term of 5 years
 haalanki, yah niyam khuli botalon par lagu nahin hoga
 Ghaziabad district excise officer Gyanendra Tripathi said that under the amended law, it is permissible to bring only one bottle of liquor from other states to Uttar Pradesh
 agar koi ek se adhik sharaab kii bottle le jate pakadaa jaataa he to mana jayega ki wo phayda kamaane ke liye aisa kar rahaa he
 In such a case, the person can be accused of smuggling alcohol and can take legal action
 iske alaava, nae sanshodhit kanoon ke tahat uttar pradesh main sharaab kii dukaan khule rakhane ke samay main bhi 4 ghante kii katautee kii gai he
 Under this, now liquor shops will be open from 12 noon to 10 pm
 isse pehle, dukaanon ko subah 9 baje se raat ke 11 baje tak khule rakhane kii anumati thi
 This decision has been taken on the basis of suggestions sent by various residential associations

 After meeting Prakash Javadekar, NSUI national president Feroz Khan said that Javadekar has assured these people that they will announce new dates by this evening

 In the CBSE paper leak case, the raids were carried out, the accused used to take from 10 to 15 thousand of a paper
 In front of the accused Prakash Javadekar, the students of NSUI demanded that the Chief of CBSE be sacked because the CBSE, not the student, is guilty for the paper leak
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki ek ritred nyaayadhish se is puure maamle kii jaanch karai jaae
 At the same time, a demand was also made in front of Prakash Javadekar that while retaking the examination, the students should be given the relaxation that the students who do not want to appear in the examination again, should be passed by giving an average number based on the number found in other subjects

 According to sources, the difficulty in announcing the new dates is coming because there are several competition exams to be announced one by one and the dates have already been announced and many students of 10th and 12th are also appearing in one exam

 And if they have decided then they must have done it right
 anna ko sandesh dena tha or mamtaji sandesh de rahi hai
