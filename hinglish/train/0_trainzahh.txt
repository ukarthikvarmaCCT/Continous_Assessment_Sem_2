 bataaya ja rahaa he ki inspector subodh kumaar singh ko unheen kii licency revolver chhinakar goli maari gai thi
 Not only this, before the shoot, another accused named Kalua attacked Subodh Singh with an ax

 In fact, there have been heartbreaking reports about the death of Inspector Subodh Singh in the Bundalshahar violence on 3 December
 gaukashi ke baad hinsak bheed ko inspekator subodh kumaar samajha rahe the, tabhi kalua naam ke ek shaks ne kulhadi se inspector par hamalaa kar diya
 Inspector Subodh Kumar's finger was cut from the first blow
 phir bhi kalua nahin mana or lagaataar kiye gaye waar se kulhadi se subodh kumaar kaa sar bhi fat gaya
 Subodh Kumar ran towards the farm to save his life, where 31-year-old Prashanth Nut and his associates caught Subodh Kumar
 subodh kumaar ne aatmaraksha main goli chalaai jisamen sumit naam ke ek ladke kii maut ho gai , jiske baad prashanth nat or uske saathiyon ne subodh kii licency revolver chin lee
 After snatching the revolver, a man named Johnny grabbed Subodh Kumar and knelt down and Prashanth Nat shot Subodh Kumar with the same revolver as Subodh Kumar
 ye log itane main hi nahin ruke, subodh kumaar ke mrit sharir par bhi in logon ne laathiyon or pathar se waar kiya
 After a while when the rest of the police started carrying Subodh Kumar's body in the car amidst stone pelting, the mob threw stones at the car itself, after which the policemen left Subodh Kumar and fled
 gaadi updraviyon ne apane kabze main le lee or subodh kumaar ko gaadi sahit jalaane kii koshish bhi kii
 But somehow the policemen saved Subodh Kumar from burning
 prashanth nat kii pahchaan kai video ke aadhaar par kii gai thi, prashanth ghatana ke baad se apane parivaar sahit gaayab tha
 Kalua, who was hit by an ax, is still being searched by the police

 Whether or not Pawar agrees to Ajit Pawar's departure with BJP, a challenge has arisen for Supriya Sule, a political game has taken place at the national level in Maharashtra that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's ambition to become Chief Minister has broken
 pradesh main shivasena-congress-ensipi sarkaar banaati isse pehle hi sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ne bijepi ko samarthan dekar dipti siem ban gaye
 After this new development, questions are being raised whether Sharad Pawar's consent is behind Ajit Pawar's going with BJP
 sharad pavaar kaa jawaab aa gaya he lekin sawaal uthne lage hai ki maharashtra kii siyasat main hue pherbadal se kya sharad pavaar kaa raajnneetik kariyar khatm ho jayega?raajnneetik kariyar khatm ho jayega?mumbai main shanivaar kii subah log sahi se uth bhi nahin paae the ki devendra fadanvis siem or ajit pavaar dipti siem pad kii shapath le chuke the
 In such a situation, there is a question that Ajit Pawar has agreed with Sharad Pawar, considered Chanakya of Maharashtra
 vaaki aisa hua he to phir sharad pavaar apni raajnneetik vishwasaneeyata kho baithenge
 In such a situation, no party will show seriousness about his words in future nor will anyone be able to make any move with him in politics
 aisi sthiti main sharad pavaar ke bhavishya ke siyaasi raah par sankat ke badal chaa sakate hai
 However, Sharad Pawar has made it clear that the NCP does not have this support
 varisht patrkaar ashutosh ne kaha ki devendra fadanvis or ajit pavaar kii sarkaar banavaane ke peeche sharad pavaar agar khadey hai to isse unki siyasat par asar padegaa
 The ncp's political career will also end with Sharad Pawar losing his credibility
 saath hi sangh vichaarak sangeet raagi ne kaha ki ajit pavaar ke peeche sharad pavaar or ensipi khadi hogi
 If this is not the case, NCP will end with Ajit Pawar's departure
 ensipi par pakad dhili padi!ajit pavaar ke peeche agar sharad pavaar nahin khadey hai to aisi sthiti main yah saaf ho gaya he ki ab party par unki pakad nahin rah gai he
 The way 25 to 30 mlas are being supported with Ajit Pawar
 usase saaf he ki ajit pavaar ne ensipi ko tod diya he
 Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule also believes that both the family and the party have broken up
 supriya sule ne kaha he ki, 'jivan main kyon kisi par bharosa karen, maine khud ko itnaa thaga hua pehle kabhi mahasoos nahin kiya
 The one whom i loved so much, i defended and got what i got in return
 'supriya sule kaa raajnneeti graphise main sharad pavaar umr ke jis padaav par khadey hai, aisi sthiti main unke saamne ensipi ko dobaaraa se khadaa karne kii ek badi chunauti hogi
 The politics graph of Supriya Sule is not all over Maharashtra
 itnaa hi nahin wo rajya kii raajnneeti se zyada rashtriya siyasat main sakriy rahi hai
 In such a situation, how much Supriya Sule is able to establish herself in front of Ajit Pawar
 ye badi chunauti hogi

 " This time in Prayag is Ardh Kumbh but it is election year, so the government gave it the name of Kumbh and they have left no stone unturned to make the divine Kumbh grand
 yah alag baat he ki kis jameen par kitna divya he yah to janata hi bataaegi lekin philhal snaan karne vaale makar sankranti kii bheed par prashasan ke aankadon kii baazeegari kii divyata jarur dikhaai padi
 After the bath of Makar Sankranti, the fair administration held a press conference around 5:00 pm and told the number of people who took a dip in the confluence
 bataaya ki 14 janvari ko 56 lakh se adhik or 15 janvari ko ek karod 40 lakh log yani kul 2 karod se adhik logon ne kumbh main snaan kiya
 The fair administration's claim that this was a rough estimate
 is aankade se vahaan maujuud sabhi patrkaar chaunk uthe or bade vyangyatmak lahaze main bole ki abhi kuch or motaa hoga yaa itnaa hi rahegaa, "2 karod ko adhikrut mana jaye, abhi or aankade aayenge ki ise final mana jaye, abhi bad gaya to mauni amavasya main bhi bad jaayegaa
 "swachh Kumbh" claims open poll: Thousands of toilets spoiled on the very first day, this satirical attitude of the devotees forced to defecate in the open did not affect the fair authorities but the number of journalists present there was all this It was not keeping coincidence and journalists who were doing journalism in Allahabad for three decades
 inhen main ek surendra pratap singh ne bataaya, "mela prashasan jo kah rahaa he ki 2 karod logon ne snaan kiya ye kisi ke gale nahin utrega
 It is believed that giving a bath of a quarter to twenty million is a divine sign
 ab baat duusari he ki 33 karod devtaa bhi jod len to bahut ho saktaa he drishy or adrishy
 i believe that the scene cannot happen
 'kumbh Mela 2019: kumbh meley main agar kho jaaen aapke bachche, to inase karen samparkpichley kumbh main pehali baar sankhyikee ke polinamiyal vidhi se bheed ke aane kaa anumaan lagane kaa dawa kiya gaya tha
 But apart from this, according to a general method, numerical experts say that a man needs a point of 25 square meters to bathe
 use nahaane main 15 minute kaa vakt lagegaa
 In such an hour, 12 thousand 500 people can take bath in an hour
 agar 18 ghante lagaataar snaan chalegaa to 2 lakh 25 hazaar log hi snaan kar sakate hai
 About 35 ghats have been built in the Kumbh region; There is no exact method of how the crowd is taking bath in these ghats
 yah baat apper mela adhikari dilip kumaar trigunayak kii baton se spasht hoti he jo kehete hai, "hamaare yahaan jo ghat hai, snaan jitne log karte hai aadhe ghante se ek ghante, is tarah kaa ek akalan hota he
 Photography or videography is done
 iskaa abhi koi digital us tarah kii masping nahin he ki is tarah kaa aankada bataaya jaae
 Kumbh 2019: Union Minister Smriti Irani took a dip in Sangam, PM Modi congratulated the nation on Kumbh, and NDTV team reviewed the bus stand and railway station of the city to know the fact, there is no sign of the crowd Was
 railway stesan par bheed to nazar nahin ai par bheed ko niyantrit karne ke liye stesan ke paas barier zarur band mili jisase yatri pareshaan hote nazar aaye
 Ramesh Mittal and his companions from Allahabad came to Allahabad station and were seen waiting for the train, which had come to Banaras and Vindhyachal to take a dip in Kumbh
 inase jab hamane bheed ke bare main poocha to inkaa anumaan prashasan se alag tha
 Ramesh Mittal (resident of Jind Haryana) said, 'the estimate must have been around 20 lakhs, because the time of morning was a huge crowd at the time of the royal bath
 har taraf sar hi sar the lekin ab jab laut rahe hai to bheed itani nahin he
 Now it is also a request to the administration that in view of the crowd, they should have opened a little way
 'makar sankranti se shuru hua Kumbh 2019 kaa pehla shahi snaan, Photos main dekhen ye khubasurat nazaaraa2 karod logon ko laane le jane ke liye utane hi bade paimaane par transpotation kii bhi zaroorat padegi
 The railway department had run 37 Mela special trains, add 200 regular trains to it and also add 500 Mela special buses, private vehicle figures of people, even if so many people cannot come to Prayagraj city with a population of 50 lakh
 isse saafe he ki kumbh main dubkee lagane ke aankadon kii baazeegari se use hakeekat kii jameen par nahin utaara ja saktaa

 Meanwhile, Congress leader Hardik Patel said in a special conversation with Aaj Tak that this time in Gujarat, the Bharatiya Janata Party will suffer
 yuva se lekar kisaan tak sabhi bijepi se naakhush hai
 People will take the right decision
 congress netaa hardik patel ne bijepi par jamkar hamalaa bolaa or kaha ki gujarat main koi modi factor nahin he

 Congress is doing very well here as the opposition

 Hardik Patel has said that Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur's comment on Shaheed Hemant Karkare is very sad, how can she make such a comment
 main khush nahin hum, yah bahut galat he ki vah chunaav lard rahi he or main chunaav nahin lard paa rahi hum
 This should not have happened

 vah sarvshereshth pradhanmantri honge
 The one who is on his own runs the same: Alpesh, Jignesh and Hardik trio had good influence in the assembly but during the current Lok Sabha elections these three leaders did not show up together? On this, Hardik Patel said that time teaches everything
 jo apane dam par he, vahi chalata he
 Hardik Patel, who was in line for voting, said that it is our tradition to vote
 main use (patni ko) nahin bataaungaa ki kise vot dena he lekin mujhe yakeen he ki vah logon ke muddon par matdaan karegi

 jharkhand ucch nyaayalay ke nyaayamurti eke gupta va rajesh kumaar kii khand peeth ne mangalvaar ko sibiai kii us apil yachika ko sunwaayee ke liye sweekrut kar liya jisamen lalu prasad sahit saat logon kii sajaa badhaane kii maang kii gai he
 During the hearing, the cbi's appeal on behalf of Lalu Prasad was strongly opposed
 unka kahana tha ki CBI ne sajaa badhaane kii yachika daakhil karne main 211 din kii deree kii he isliye unki yachika par sunwaayee nahin kii jaae
 On his behalf, the Supreme Court's order was cited in one of Lalu's own cases, in which it is said that in such serious and important cases, the CBI should file a petition in time
 iske alaava lalu ke vakeelon ne tark diya ki CBI dwaara sajaa badhaane kii maang kaa aadhaar galat he kyonki CBI adaalat ne is maamle main kai logon ko alag-alag avadhi kii sajaa sunai he
 The CBI told the court that in this case of fodder scam, all the accused have the same charge, so the punishment should also be one
 donon pakshon ko sunne ke baad nyaayalay ne yachika daakhil karne main hui deree ko shithil kar diya or CBI kii yachika ko sunwaayee ke liye sweekrut kar liya
 There is a provision for filing a petition from the special court of CBI within three months of the order in this case, but in this case, CBI has filed an appeal in the High Court for extension of sentence after 211 days of the time period
 CBI kii ore se lalu prasad va anya kii sajaa ko badhaane kii maang karte hue ucch nyaayalay main yachika daakhil kii gai he
 The petition stated that the CBI special court in the illegal withdrawal case from Deoghar Treasury, Lalu Prasad, Dr
 aarake rana, bek julius, adheep chandra choudhary, mahesh prasad, phulchandra singh or subir bhattacharya ko saadhe teen-teen saal kii sajaa sunai he jabaki isi maamle main jagadish sharma ko saat saal kii kaid kii sajaa sunai he
 The CBI has said that all the people who got punishment were posted in high positions and they are accused of hatching a high level conspiracy
 aise main jab maamla sabit ho gaya he to sabhi ko ek hi tarah kii sajaa milani chahie
 The CBI requested the court that keeping these things in mind, the sentence of all the accused should be increased to seven years

 a special court hearing former Pakistan dictator Pervez Musharraf was today accused of treason
 vah aise pehle sainya shaasha ban gaye hai, jinhen aapraadhik abhiyog kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 Musharraf, who appeared in court, is accused of treason under Section 6
 un par yah maamla november 2007 main samvidhan ko nilambit karne, nasht karne or nirast karne, apatkaal lagane tathaa sheersh adaalaton ke nyaayadhishon ko hiraasat main rakhane se sambandhit he
 The 70-year-old Musharraf is the first military ruler in Pakistan's history to be tried in court
 vaise, musharraf ne apane upar lage sabhi aaropon se inkaar kiya he
 Musharraf said, whatever i did, i did for the country
 mujhe dukh he ki mujhe deshadrohi kaha ja rahaa he
 He also said that he has given 44 years of his life to the Pakistan Army and strengthened the defense forces
 musharraf ne kaha ki unhone desh ko pratishtha or pragati di
 In response, prosecutor Akram Sheikh said that he has never used the word 'traitor'
 sindh hoicourt ke nyaayadhish faisal arab ne purv sena pramukh ke khilaaf aarope padhakar sunaae
 Before the indictment, a new lawyer for Musharraf's defense team, Farog Naseem, urged the court to allow his client to visit the UAE to see his 95-year-old ailing mother
 unhone kaha ki sanvadhin kisi ko bhi kisi naagarik kii gatividhiyon ko pratibandhit karne kii anumati nahin detaa
 Nasim said that while Musharraf voluntarily reached the court, a warrant was not served against his client
 unhone kaha ki unka muvakkil khud bhi aswasth he or musharraf kaa sahi upachaar keval america main sambhav he
 The defense has filed two applications in this regard
 adaalat ne kaha ki vah in par aaj baad main vichaar karegi
 Tight security arrangements were made in court today in view of Musharraf's appearance in compliance with the March 14 order
 musharraf ko 2 janvari ko adaalat ke raste main hriday sambandhi samasya kii shikaayat ke baad rawalpindi sthit sashastr bal hriday rog aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 The military has ruled for almost half the time in Pakistan's 66-year history and no ruler or military commander has faced criminal prosecution before Musharraf
 pichley saal march main swanirvaasan se lautne ke baad musharraf ko 2007 main hui purv pradhanmantri benazir bhutto kii hatya tathaa 2006 main balooch rashtravaadi netaa akbar bugti ke maare jane sahit chaar bade abhiyogon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said that current captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virender Sehwag have settled their differences
 ganguli ne ek kaarykram ke dauraan patrakaron se kaha ki unhone sahvaag se baat kii jinhone kaha ki dhoni or unke bich sab kuch sulajh gaya he
 During the tri-series in Australia, there were reports of differences between Dhoni and Sehwag due to the rotation policy for three openers Sachin Tendulkar, Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir
 ganguli se jab poocha gaya ki aisa mana ja rahaa he ki dhoni kai khilaadiyon ko mauka nahin de rahe hai or fiks team ke saath khelnaa pasand karte hai
 He said, 'every captain is different and no captain is perfect
 ho saktaa he ki dhoni ko vishwaas ho ki yah team jeet sakati he kyonki koi bhi captain haarana nahin chahta he
 Ganguly was asked if he were the captain, would he have given an opportunity to Manoj Tiwari and Ashok Dinda, he said, "I might have given him a chance but hopefully Dhoni will also give these players a chance
" ’ unhone kaha, ‘bengal kii team main teen achche khilaadi hai manoj, dinda or riddhimaan saaha
 They are international level players
 yah bengal ke liye acha sanket he
 Apart from this, Mohammad Samee is also a good player
 ’ Paparao, a Naxalite leader who led the Maoist campaign in Chhattisgarh and border areas, is still alive

 The leaflet issued by the Maoists denied that their leader, Paparao, had died
 police ke hawaale se kuch din pehle yah khabar ai thi ki maovadi netaa paparav ko saanp ne kaat liya he
 Because of which he died
 naksaliyon ne apane parche menis baat kaa khandan kiya he
 The Naxalite leaflet said that the news of Paparao's death was only a conspiracy by the police
 police ne aisa naksali andolan ko kamjor karne ke liye kiya
 Significantly, the police is carrying out a campaign of surrender and encounter of Maoists under the anti-naxal operation

 i am not saying that i am their friend but i know them
 main unka sammaan karata hum or vah meraa sammaan karte hai isliye shaayad unhone apni kahani ko bayaan karne ke liye mujhe chunaa he

 Hello i Ravish Kumar> If you have ever had the opportunity to live in a village panchayati, then you can better understand the issue going on within and outside the Aam Aadmi Party
 manzure khuda se pehle panchon ke khudaai farmaan aane lage hai
 Muddai i
e
 witnesses are saying something else and the issue is lost elsewhere
 vaise faisla abhi nahin hua he
 Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal seems unlikely to attend the meeting on 4 March
 karaab tabiyat ke kaaran arvind das dinon ke liye dilli se baahar ja rahe hai
 Arvind has tweeted that i am deeply hurt by what is going on in the party
 main is gandi ladaai main padane vaala nahin hum
 Under no circumstances will the trust of the public be broken
 unke is twit se atakalein lagane lageen ki arvind ne apana faisla suna diya he
 After saying the next battle, the dirty fight, people are asking why Arvind is not doing anything then
 unke twit se yah bhi saaf nahin hua ki ve kisase aahat hai
 From the statements of yogendra-prashanth or from the statements of Ashutosh Ashish and Dileep
 janata ke bharose main sarkaar chalaane ke saath yah bhi shaamil hota he ki netaa apane rajnatik netritv kii zimmedaari kis tarah nibhaataa he
 This dispute is taking both Arvind's life and examination
 fark sirf itnaa he ki arvind ke saamne koi nayaa parchaa nahin aayaa he
 Medha Patkar's separation with Anna, Kiran Bedi, Shazia Ilmi may not have been the IIT level form but it was at the board level
 prashanth or yogendra ne chitthee li kii he to lokapal ko likhi dilip kii chitthee kisne li kii he
 The Lokpal Admiral Ramdoss himself has written about his letter being leaked in the Economic Times
 li ke badhate aaropon ko dekhte hue aam aadmi party main lokapal ke saath likapal bhi hona chahie
 It is only the leak who officially leaks the letters and leaks me first
 ho sake to meraa phone bhi record kar le taaki main kah sakuun ki lokapal ne nahin likapal ne di he
 However, both the journalist's sting and the journalist's source are serious matters
 yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan jo media main kah rahe hai or jo party main kah rahe hai kya donon main kuch antar he
 Has this also led to bitterness in the statements of the spokesmen
 agar aisa he to pravaktaaon daayen baayen bolne kii jagah unheen baton ko kyon nahin saarvajanik kar diya
 If the Aam Aadmi Party does not democratically give place to political ambitions and disagreements, then how is it different from others
 raajnneetik mahatvakanksha kaa hona ek saamaanya or swaabhaavik raajnneetik harakat he
 The ambition of a political party is power
 lokapal admiral ramdaas ne mangalvaar ko iconomik times main yogendra or prashanth ke sawaalon kaa samarthan kiya he, balki likhaa he ki rashtriya sanyojak ke saath sah sanyojak ke pad par bhi vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 He has also written that the crew of sailors who sail any ship varies
 aam aadmi party jahaaz ke navik dal kaa badalte rahanaa zaruri he
 It is also a common procedure for long distance travel
 aakhir main yah sab captain par nirbhar karata he ki wo tamaam mushkilon se jahaaz ko nikaal kar manzil par surakshit pahunchayegaa
 Admiral Ramdas has given this experience of the Navy as amulets to the common man
 admiral ko un aaropon par bhi faisla dena chahie jo prashanth bhushan or dilip pandey ne unke yahaan jamaa kiye hai
 The issues with which they are agreeing may not come under the purview of Lokpal
 ye or baat he ki kisi ne lokapal ramdaas ke khuleam lekh likhane ko lekar hamalaa nahin bolaa he
 However, Ramdas's expectation from the captain suggests that the feud may not have reached its end
 jaise hi aap ashutosh or ashish khetaan ke twit padhate hai, aapako lagata he ki yogendra or prashanth ko janaa hi hoga
 No one has questioned his tweet as to why personal attacks are happening
 ashish khetaan ne twit kiya he ki shanti, shalini or prashanth party ko pita, putr or putree kii party bana dena chaahate hai
 On Monday, Ashutosh said that there is an ideological fight
 vyakti kii nahin
 On Tuesday, the tweet said that there is a confrontation between the ultra-left party seeking a referendum in Kashmir and those doing practical politics for the good of the people
 pradhanmantri ne jab naksal kaha tha tab aap ke netaa or samarthakon ne soshal media par khub hamalaa bolaa tha
 Are they now telling themselves that their party has ultra left, which is talking about a referendum in Kashmir
 jab isi baat ko lekar aap kii aalochana hui thi to aap ke netaaon ne prashanth se kinaaraa kar yahaan tak saath to nibhaayaa hi
 Now it is not clear whether the people talking about ultra left are only Prashant or Yogendra with Prashant or there are other people besides Prashant and Yogendra
 kya ye gussa isliye bhi he ki jo kaha ja rahaa he uske alaava kuch or sach he
 Meanwhile, AAP has also formed a three-member committee to settle the dispute, whose chairman Professor Anand Kumar told our colleague Himanshu Shekhar Mishra today that he has spoken to Yogendra, Prashant and Arvind for a long time
 khaskar shanti bhushan ke yah kehane ke baad ki prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav ko kejariwal kaa samarthan karnaa chahie ki vahi sanyojak rahen
 These three are the backbone of the party
 professor anand kumaar ne himanshu se kaha ki kanta nikal gaya he
 Anand Kumar does not feel that the matter is so bad that it cannot be resolved
 yogendra yadav ne somvaar ko prime time main kaha tha ki ve apane sawaalon ko lekar kisi dedline kii baat nahin kar rahe hai
 He has never spoken of removing Arvind, but opposed his resignation in the executive
 yogendra ne arvind ke vilakshan netritv kii tarif kii thi
 Many said that Yogendra and Prashant are retreating
 par jab antim faisla hoga tab hoga
 But the way the public procedure was done before the decision is justified, it can be talked about
 bahes ke baad do filmein dekh sakate hai

 aatankiyon ke paas se 4 eke-47 rifl, 4 under bairal grenade launchars or aise kai hathiyaar mili hai, jinka istemaal jang ke vakt hota he
 All weapons are made in Pakistan
 jaish-e-mohammad ke hai chaaron aatankiis baat kii pusht ho chuki he ki chaaron aatanki jaish-e-mohammad ke hai
 This is the same terrorist organization that attacked the Pathankot airbase 8 months ago
 hairaani ye he ki iskaa aakaa masood ajahar most wanted he, lekin wo pakistan kii sarapasti main naa sirf aaazaad gum rahaa he, balki pakistani chhadam yuddh kaa mohara bhi bana hua he
 Ignoring the evidence PAK has given evidence to Pakistan regarding the Uri attack
 pakistan kesainya adhikariyonse naaraazgi or chintaa bhi jataa di gai
 But the shamelessness of Pakistan is such that like every time it is not only defying the evidence, but also ignoring it
 pakistani videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa nafij jakaaria ne kaha ki bina jaanch ke pakistan kaa naam lenaa galat he
 The University Grants Commission (UGC) has asked all central universities to ban junkfood on campus

 Let there be a total of 40 central universities across the country with which all the colleges are connected
 ugcke is kadam kaa uddeshy chaatro main bad rahi khan-paan sambandhi swasthya samasyaon ko rokna he
 UGCK Secretary Jaspal Sandhu has written in the letter - along with banning junkfood at university and college campuses, new standards for healthy eating can be set for students
 dekhen : UGC ne jari kii farji vishvavidhyalayon kii list
 
 
 The letter also asked all the central universities to make students aware of the ill effects of junk food
 iske liye shikshakon or karmchaariyon ke liye swasthya jaagrukta kaarykram yojit karne kii salaah bhi di gai he jiske liye chote samooh banaakar kaam kiya ja saktaa he
 In the last days of his tenure, major mistakes in the Ministry of Defense had become a headache for the previous UPA government
 inamen se ek galati in dinon charchaa main he or kathghare main kai bade naam hai
 Last year, high level officials in government circles raised their ears due to a major security concern
 vajah thi-ek pradarshnee main bheji gai bharat kii nai tactical newclear missile ke niryaat sanskaran kaa kai hafton tak videshi jameen par fansaa rahanaa
 The only prototype of the export version of the "PRAHAR", an Indian example in response to the disputed missile of Pakistan, was sent to South Korea, following the rules
 yah pehla mauka tha jab kisi itane samvedansheel hathiyaar ke prototip ko bharat se baahar bheja gaya tha
 After missing its shipping date, it remained at South Korea's port for almost a month without any security and later returned to India in November via commercial cargo via Chinese ports
 haalanki is suraksha chook par khufia beuro (ibi) kii jaanch ne kai sawaal khadey kiye, lekin march maheene main missile ke laapata hone ke is gambhir maamle ko tatkaaleen raksha mantri e
 K
 antni ke kehane par dabaa diya gaya
 Now, taking the matter seriously, the new government is preparing to conduct an inquiry into the entire process afresh
 india today jab is maamle main antni kii pratikriya lene pahunchaa to unka jawaab tha, ‘‘main aise sanjeeda maamalon par bagaiyr kisi taiyaari ke or jaldbaaji main tippanee nahin kar saktaa
 All the facts related to this matter are with the present government and any inquiry related to the case should also be with the government
 un tathyon tak ab meri pahunch nahin he
 The uneasiness over the matter can also be understood from the fact that "pragati" was designed in response to Pakistan's tactical nuclear missile
 apni is tactical newclear missile ke jariye pakistan upmahadweep ke ranneetik santulan ko badalanaa chahta tha jo apni paramparaagat majbootee kii vajah se bharat ke haq main rahaa he
 Unlike conventional long-range missiles (which have the ability to wipe out large parts of a city), these tactical missiles have the ability to be short-range, easy to hit, and very accurate to target limited-range targets
 tanks nirmaan kii jagahon or chadhaai kar rahi dushman sainya tukdi kaa in mixilon se safaya kiya ja saktaa he
 Overall, it was Pakistan's readiness to respond to India's conventional military offensive with a small and precise nuclear attack
 pichley saal shuru kii gai is nai nasr missile ko pakistani parmaanu sena pramukh ne ‘‘shanti kaa hathiyaar’’ kaha tha or bane-banaae taur-tareekon ko badalane vaali missile kii tarah pesh kiya
 Attempts were made to show that the missile could respond to enemy military attacks, and in doing so, the huge devastation caused by large weapons and the stigma of the lives of thousands of innocent people could be avoided
 bharat ne pakistan kii is koshish kaa dotarafa jawaab diya
 First of all, it indicated to Shyam Saran, Chairman of the National Security Advisory Council that the use of nuclear weapons in any form would be considered a violation of the "no First Use Policy" and eventually such an attempt would be a call for heavy retaliation
 duusari ore, bharat ne iskaa zyada vyaavhaarik jawaab pakistan kii tarj par khud kii tactical missile ‘‘prahaar’’ banaakar diya jo pakistan ke simit hamalon kaa munhtod jawaab de sakati thi
 For this reason, pragati (the exported form of the strike) was sent to the "adex Seoul Defense Exhibition" that began in South Korea on 29 October last year
 yah 60-170 kilometre kii duuri tak 200 kilogram kii yudhak saamagree le jane main sakasham thi
 It was built to replace Prithvi, India's first generation nuclear missile
 aisi pradarshaniyon main samvedansheel hathiyaaron ko bhejne ke liye niyam yah hai ki hathiyaar kii ek dami taiyaar kii jaae or usko jahaaj se bheja jaae
 But the exhibitors - the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and the manufacturer Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) - sent the prototype ready and fully "working" for testing, citing extremely non-sensitive and peculiar reasons
 
 is faisle ko khud antni se manjuuri milani thi
 But a complete report of strange incidents is found in the IB report
 is report ke anusaar 3 november ko pradarshnee khatm hone ke baad pradarshak missile ko sametane main naakaam rahe or isaki vajah se missile ko nirdhaarit taarikh par us jahaaj main nahin ladaa ja sakaa, jisase use bharat lautnaa tha
 For almost a month, the missile lay at the port without waiting for any information and any other arrangements
 jab dobaaraa intjaam hua bhi to missile ko ek saamaanya vyapaaree cargo jahaaj ke jariye bharat laana padaa
 In the meantime, the ship had to stop at the Chinese port for customary reasons
 yahaan par is missile kii takanic ke bare main kisi ko bhi aasaani se pataa lag saktaa tha
 Due to the delayed return of the missile, development projects stalled for weeks and when the news of the missile lying on foreign soil at the end of the year reached IB running from Seoul, an investigation into the entire matter was announced
 aane vaale maheenon main jaise-jaise jaanch aage badi, ibi ne paaya ki missile ko niyamon kaa ulanghan kar videsh bheja gaya or yah faisla suraksha ke lihaaj se ek bada jokhim tha
 The IB also asked the defense ministry to fix accountability in the case
 khufia vibhaag ne missile kii dekh-rekh ke tareeke or missile project jaise behad samvedansheel maamle par suraksha sambandhi laaparvaahee par bhi sawaal uthaae
 a report sent to the Defense Minister in February also questioned the role of the Chinese agent of the exhibitors for the responsibility of handling the missile in South Korea
 report ne missile ko nirdhaarit samay par jahaaj ke jariye bhejne main hui deree ke missile project par padane vaale asar kii ore bhi dhyaan khinchaa
 a few months after returning from Seoul, the prototype of the missile was scheduled to be tested
 apane kaarykaal ke antim hafton main raksha mantri e
 K
 antni ne maamle ko band karte hue ibi kii report ko dabaa diya
 Reliable sources reveal that Antony dismissed the report with rude remarks
 ibi ne is puure maamle par uthaae gaye kadam kii jaankaree lene ke jawaab main 13 march ko ek aadhikarik note main sirf itnaa likhaa tha-‘‘bhavishya main uchit saavdhaanee barti jaani chahie
 In his defense, the manufacturer BDL told the IB that the defense minister and the foreign minister had given permission to send the prototype
 diardio ne ‘‘pragati’’ or madhyam duuri kii jameen se akaash par maar karne vaali akaash missile ko tseol bhejne kii anumati maangate hue khaas taur par pragati missile ke karyrat hone kii baat likhi thi
 However, after the shame of the whole case and the IB report, the Defense Minister issued orders not to send such sensitive weapons abroad, but no accountability has been fixed in this whole matter yet
 ab jabaki sarkaar is maamle ko nae sire se dekh rahi he to sheersh netritv kaa dhyaan karrwai karne par gaya he
 It is not clear what steps the Modi government will take on the matter after the UPA government closes in the last days
 bharat lautne main hui deree ke bich missile kii takanic ke sambandh main kya jaankaree ujagar hui, is bare main bahut kam jaankaree uplabdh he
 Even the IB could not gather any information about this
 apni yarker gend ke kaaran vishwa bhar ke ballebaajon main dehshat paidaa karne vaale srilankai gendbaaj lecith maalinga ne dilli ke khilaaf twanti 20lig main paanch wicket hasil karne ke baad kaha ki vah duniya ke kisi bhi ballebaaj se nahin darate or is lig main apana kaatilaanaa pradarshan jari rakhane kii koshish karenge

 a Pakistani court said on Wednesday that a contempt petition filed against President Asif Ali Zardari would be heard on a daily basis from December 5
 yah yachika jaradaari ke raajnneetik pad (pakistan pipuls party ke pramukh) par hone ko lekar daayar kii gayi he
 The five-member bench headed by Chief Justice Omar Ata Bandiyal in the Lahore High Court made the remarks when Munir Ahmed's plea against Zardari was resumed
 yachika main aarope lagaaya gaya he ki party pramukh kaa pad chhodane kii ucch nyaayalay kii salaah ke baad bhi jaradaari raajnneetik pad par bane rahe or raajnneetik gatividhiyon ko anjaam dete rahe
 Ahmed's lawyer AK Dogar contended that Zardari had also violated the Supreme Court order stating that the President should be impartial and should not have any affiliation with any party

 ceiling ko lekar barkaraar raajnneetik halchal ke bich aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ne dilli kii 351 sadakon ko adhishuchet karne kii fil alji anil baijal ko bhej di he
 According to the Delhi government, on Tuesday, February 6, within 24 hours of receiving the survey report from the MCD, the file has been sent to the LG office for permission from Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain
 alji daphtar ko fil bhejne ke turant baad mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne twit karte hue likhaa 'jitani jald uparajyapal karyaalay se yah fil paas hokar waapas aegi, dilli sarkaar fil ko bina der kiye supreme court ko bhej degi taaki jald-jald se in 351 sadakon ko adhisuchana ke daayre main laayaa ja sake'
 Within one hour of the file pertaining to change of land use of 351 roads, which had been pending since 2006 with mcds, being put upto Urban Development minister @ satyendarjain, the minister has recommended the file for lg's approval
 Minister was constantly following it with mcds— Nagendar Sharma (@sharmanagendar)february 7, 2018buudhvaar ko aam aadmi party ke 36 vidhayakon ne dilli vikaas praadhikaran (didie) ko ceiling se jald nipatane ke suzav bhi die
 According to 'AAP' MLA and DDA member Somnath Bharti, 'the entire solution of sealing is present in the master plan of Delhi
 badlaav karne ke baad unhen kriyanvit karne main vakt lagegaa lekin agar sansad main centre kii bhaajapa sarkaar dwaara turant prabhaav se kanoon ko sanshodhit karti he to dilli main ceiling turant prabhaav se ruk sakati he
 Aam Aadmi Party mlas are suggested to the DDA that ceilings can be stopped if the DDA increases the FAR of the second and third floor shops in the Delhi markets
 iske alaava i, eff or ji category kii sadakon par survey karake yah dekha jaae ki agar unamem se koi sadak 70 pratishat se zyada vyavsaayik he to use adhishuchet karke hi vyavsaayik kar diya jaae
 Meanwhile, Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh also raised the issue of ceiling in Rajya Sabha
 sanjay singh ne rajyasabha main kaha ki 'dilli main bhaajapa ke paas emsidi he, bhaajapa ke paas didie he or centre kii isi sarkaar ke kaaran hi dilli main vyapaariyon ke dhandhe ujaad rahe hai

 bijepi adhyaksh nitin gadakari ko ek or hamale kaa saamana karnaa padaa, jab party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini ke sadsy jagadish shettigar ne maang kii ki purti samooh ko sandigdh vittaposhan ke aaropon ke maddenjar unhen istipha de dena chahie
 Shetigar said, Gadkari is also a Swayamsevak (RSS worker), whose religion is to protect the nation's interest first and then the party's interest
 isliye antaratma se swayamsevak hone ke naate mujhe yakeen he ki vah samooche desh or sanghathan ke hit main sarvshereshth kadam uthaaenge
 He mentioned that it is important to take timely steps on behalf of Gadkari
 netaa ne kaha ki logon kii soch kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie or jaanch prakriya puri hone tak gadakari ko istipha de dena chahie
 Shettigar cited the example of BJP leader LK Advani, who resigned after being accused in the hawala case
 unhone yah ghoshnaa bhi kii thi ki vah kabhi chunaav nahin ladenge
 The comments shettigar ne aresas ke vichaarak es gurumurti dwaara gadakari ko di gai clin chit par yah kahkar tippanee se inkaar kiya ki unhone unki report kaa adhyayan nahin kiya he
 However, he said that there should be an internal mechanism to see if a person is corrupt or not
 shettigar ne kaha, jo kaha gaya he, agar vah sahi he, to meraa maananaa he ki yah uske anuroop nahin he jise aap sebi yaa anya sansthaanon ke niyam kehete ho

 The Supreme Court of the country has rebuked that the Central Government is bent on stopping the work of NRC
 darasal, centre sarkaar ne supreme court main yah arji lagaai thi ki loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar surakshabalon kii kami he, isliye enarasi kii prakriya ko do hafte tak rokane kii ijaajat di jaae
 Expressing displeasure over the appeal of the Home Ministry, the court said on Tuesday that it appears that the Center is bent on stopping the work of NRC
 iske saath hi court ne yah bhi saaf kar diya ki enarasi ko antim rup dene ke liye 31 july kii jo samay-seemaa he, use nahin badhaayaa jayega
 The Home Minister gave this answer, after this strict comment of the Court, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the government is committed to complete the NRC process within the stipulated time frame
 saath hi unhone yah bhi kaha ki kisi bhi videshi ko NRC main shaamil nahin kiya jaae or koi bhi bhartiya naagarik isamen shaamil hone se chute nahin
 The Central Government gave these arguments in the court during the hearing of the Attorney General of the Attorney General
 ke venugopal ne apni daleel main kaha ki namakan patr daakhil karne kii aakhri taarikh se aagaamee chunaav kii taarikh ke do hafte baad tak yah prakriya roak di jaae kyonki assam main enarasi ke kaam main lagi kendriya sashastr police bal (siepief) kii 167 companiyon ko chunaavon ke dauraan kanoon vyavastha barkaraar rakhane ke liye desh ke anya hisson main bheja jayega
 On this argument, Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice R
 epa nariman kii peeth ne kaha, 'hamen yah kehete hue dukh ho rahaa he ki grih mantralay NRC kii prakriya aage nahin badhaane par tula hua he or vah is adaalat dwaara kiye ja rahe sabhi prayaason par pani pherane main laga he
 'the court gave this formula, the bench gave some instructions on this problem of the central government

 is par grih mantralay ke adhikari ke jawaab se court santusht nahin hua or chif justise ne kaha ki kya aap chaahate hai ham grih sachiv or anya sambandhit adhikariyon ko talab karen
 100 ways to work on this when k
 ke venugopal or assam sarkaar kaa pratinidhitiv kar rahe solicitre general tushaar mehta ne hastkshep karne kaa prayaas kiya to peeth ne kaha ki adhikariyon ne unhen paryaapt jaankaree nahin di he
 The bench said, "if you have the will, then there are 100 ways to work
" bharat sarkaar bilkul sahyog nahin kar rahi he
 The NRC process is being stopped
 chunaav nishchit taur par shantipurna or vyavasthit tareeke se hone chahie
 Similarly, the work of NRC should also be done with peace
 ' peeth ne yahaan tak kaha diya ki kya ham sarkaar se bahut zyada maang rahe hai
 However, on the need for security forces, the Attorney General said that 2500 CAPF companies were deployed in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and this year about 2700 companies will be needed to ensure law and order
 unhone kaha ki assam main enarasi ke kaam kii nigaraanee ke liye siepief kii 167 companiyaan lagi hui hai or chunaav ke dauraan unhen desh ke anya hisse main bheja jayega
 On this, a bench of Justice Gogoi said that you (center) have 3000 armed companies
 aapako chunaav ke liye 2700 companiyon kii jarurat he
 167 companies are required for NRC work in Assam
 phir samasya kya he? court ke is tark par venugopal ne kaha ki hamen seemaa kii bhi raksha karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 The security of the country is included in this
 venugopal ne yah bhi kaha ki chunaav ke dauraan raajnneetik maahaul kaaphi garam rahane kii ummid he or aise main enarasi maamalon par sunwaayee upyukt nahin hogi
 After hearing all the arguments, the court also said that the state authorities should be helped for NRC and the bench reserved its decision
 is maamle par ab march ke pehle saptaah main sunwaayee hogi
