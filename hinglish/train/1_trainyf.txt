 The administration has become very active with the arrival of Yogi Adityanath government in UP

 In the last three days, more than 300 slaughterhouses have been closed all over Uttar Pradesh
 lakhanu se lekar hathras or mau se lekar gorakhpur tak har jagah police sadak par meet or machhlee bechney waalon ko bhi hataa rahi he
 Around 20 slaughterhouses in Ghaziabad adjacent to Delhi have also been closed
 boojadkhaanon main kaam kar karne vaale logon kii maang he ki sarkaar unhen duusari jagah rojgaar de yaa phir boojadkhaane chalaane kaa license de
 They are now preparing to go to court

 By the time we reached the illegal slaughterhouse in Loni for the last 12 years, the police had come and sealed it
 diwaar par chilein baithi hui thim
 May be wondering where the meat and dead animals that they found under this wall suddenly disappeared by yesterday
 yogi adityanath kii sarkaar aane ke baad se adhikari kaaphi vyast ho gaye hai or behad sakriy bhi
 Loni's SDM Premaranjan says that "such a campaign is going on all over the state
" koi likhit aadesh nahin hua he, par prashasan sakht ho gaya he
 We are locating and closing illegal slaughterhouses

 He says that this was happening since his father and grandfather's time
 ve kehete hai ki ab kaam band hone se shaayad unke bachche yah karne ke liye jinda hi na bachein, kyonki ab ve berozegaar hai
 There were many more people who started showing their licenses
 boojadkhaanon ke in kamgaaron kaa aarope he ki pichley 20 saalon se unke license rineau nahin kiye ja rahe the
 Suddenly the administration took away their livelihood
 khayr maahaul bananaa bhi jaruri he, lekin sawaal yahi he ki agar prashasan itnaa hi chaukanna tha to yah avaidh boojadkhaane pehle kyon nahin band karaae gaye? kyon nai sarkaar banate hi prashasan ati sakriy ho gaya? NDTV reached Loni in Ghaziabad to know the ground situation where many illegal slaughterhouses have been closed on Wednesday
 jab ham loni main pichley 12 saal se chal rahe avaidh boojadkhaane tak pahunche tab tak police vahaan aakar sil laga chuki thi
 The eagles were sitting on the wall
 shaayad soch rahi hongi ki kal tak is diwaar ke neeche unhen khaane ke liye milane vaala maance or mare jaanavar achaanak kahaan gaayab ho gaye

 "comments hamaari 65 saal ke mahmud kuraishi se bhi mulaakaat hui
 His slaughterhouse has also been locked on Tuesday
 vah bataate hai ki unke baap-dada ke jamaane se yahi kaam ho rahaa tha
 They say that now their children may not survive to do this due to the closure of work, because now they are unemployed
 vahaan kai or log mili jo apane license dikhaane lage
 These slaughterhouse workers allege that their licenses were not renewed for the last 20 years
 achaanak prashasan ne unki roji-roti chin lee
 Well it is important to create an atmosphere, but the question is that if the administration was so vigilant, why were these illegal slaughterhouses not closed earlier? Why did the administration become very active as soon as a new government was formed? yogi adityanath kii sarkaar aane ke baad se adhikari kaaphi vyast ho gaye hai or behad sakriy bhi

 But this year due to change in admission process, only students who were eligible were able to apply
 college 640 chaatro ko commers main or 148 chaatro ko arthshaastra ke vishay main pravesh de sakaa
 Says Jain, "for the past 40 years, we have been struggling to bring commerce education on par with highly demanding medical and engineering courses
 jab hamane shat-pratishat cat of kii ghoshnaa kii, tab ham jaanate hi the ki chaatr is apeksha par bhi khare utrenge
 This year, the cut-off for non-commerce students to enter commerce was 100%
 haalanki isse kai logon ko ek bada jhtka jaisaa laga, phir bhi duusari cat-of kii ghoshnaa hone ke pehle hi esarsisi ko record sankhya main aavedan mili
 This year the college admitted a record 413 students for its two courses
 ab college kaa lakshya he undergraduate str par apane chaatro ko zyada peshewar anubhav uplabdh karana
 Jain calls it a 'more tailored course of industry'
 niyamit kakshaon ke alaava, esarsisi apane chaatro ke liye udyogon ke niyamit daure yojit karaata he or company adhikariyon ko chaatro ke saath mulaakaat ke liye bhi bulaata rahata he
 "this year we had a video conference with Citibank CEO Vikram Pandit," says Mehak Nanar, a second-year commerce student
 unhone hamen commers udyog main kaam karne ke laabh bataae
 The college has 108 teachers and a teacher-student ratio of 1:12
 iske alaava sari kakshaon main alsidi screen lage 'e hai or saidhantik vishyon kii adhikansh padhai audio-vijual pranali se hoti he

 Obviously, the priority is not just to teach
 esarsisi main chaatro ke sabase sakriy or prabhavi sanghathanon main se ek students in free enterprise he, jo samaaj ke sarvaadhik vanchit virgon main udhyamshiltaa paidaa karne ke liye karyrat he

 "certainly, placement in multinational companies is the second reason why the college attracts hundreds of students to apply every year
" tata kansaltency services, pricewaterkupar, wipro or ibm un vishaal korporations main se kuch hai, jo har saal is college se apane liye chaatro ko bhartee karte hai
 It was well-deserved if the college secured second place with 12 out-of-society organizations such as the Bengali Literary Society, Xavierian Theatrical Society, and 19 committees such as the Dress Code Committee and Internal Assessment Committee, along with off-campus programs for students
 college apane paathyakram or shikshan paddatiyon ko antarrashtriya maanakon ke anuroop rakhane main bhi samarth rahaa he
 "the syllabus is more student-oriented and because of this the students are given private attention," says the college consortium
 ''chennai sthit kai vishyon vaale loyola college ko is saal teesraa sthaan mila he
 The college not only focuses on business studies and strategy, but also on developing leadership qualities in students
 college ke do antarrashtriya exange kaarykram hai or usne videsh ke 33 vishvavidhyalayon ke saath antarrashtriya sahmati patron par dastakhat kiye hai
 Francis Jose, head of the commerce department at Loyola College, says, "our objective is not just to tell the students the working side of commerce, but also to involve them in the overall development of being industry-ready
" '' unhone is vibhaag ko ek nai disha di he
 "apart from this, we are also working on incorporating science subjects in commerce so that if commerce students want to start business in the science stream, they can easily explain its needs and nuances," says Jose
 ''yahaan ke chaatro ne college ke shatabdi varsh main loyola 2025 future plan bhi shuru kiya he
 It is not surprising that students are drawn to Loyola College in large numbers every year due to its constantly evolving infrastructure and revising the curriculum

 Bas ab Kuch kar dikhao!🇮🇳 When the party's national president Nitin Gadkari took the name of Inspector Mohan Chandra Sharma, who was killed in the Batla House scandal, in a rally held on February 20 in support of Bharatiya Janata Party candidate Shiv Pratap Rajput in Dibiyapur, Uttar Pradesh Definitely added
 bakaul gadakari, ‘aakhir aatankiyon kii maut par hi sonia ko aansu kyon aate hai, shahadat dene vaale pandit mohan chandra sharma ke parivaar kii ve chintaa kyon nahin karatin?’ is chunavi bhaashan main khaas baat yah he ki apane pratyaashee ko jitaane ke liye brahmanon ke swabhimaan ko jagaaya gaya
 See detailed coverage on the UP election, out of 19 chief ministers so far, 14 have been Savarnas
 aazaadee ke baad se '90 ke dashak kii shuruyaat tak soobe kii raajnneeti thakur banaam brahman banaam baniyaa rahi, or tab shaayad hi koi netaa is tarah ke jatigat gathjod kii baat sochataa tha
 But in the last two decades, the arrogance of the upper castes in the boom of the backward and then Dalit politics came out in such a way that they were forced to forget the distinction of thakur-brahmin-baniya-kayastha and come to a platform and in the face of this compulsion BJP and Congress Is showing its edge asal main pradesh main shuruaati chaar charan main hue matdaan ke dauraan ausatan 58 fisadi vot pade
 This figure is 15 percent higher than the 2007 assembly elections
 aise main ek dharna yahi ban rahi he ki dalit matadaata ne to pichhali baar bhi apni puri kshamta se vot diya tha, lihaaja is baar ke bade hue matdaan main agadi jatiyon ke voter kii acchhee-khaasi hissedari honi chahie
 Due to the freedom to go to the polling booth by car, the women of forward castes also cast lots of votes
 voting ko lekar agadon ke utsaah or khamosh lamabandi ke trend ke bare main lakhanu vishvavidhyalay main raajnneetishastra ke professor dow
 Ramesh Dixit says, 'brahmins, Thakurs, Vaishyas and Kayasthas of the Savarna community, like other castes, could not organize as a political unit for a long time
 yahi vajah he ki rajnatik kshetra main unka asar dikhnaa band ho gaya tha
 They may not be declared right, but in a new political environment, they are voting from a new perspective
 ’is nae nazariye kii taraf ishaara karte hue uttar pradesh brahman mahamandal ke adhyaksh hariom pathak kehete hai, ‘samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) sarkaron ke dauraan mili upeksha ke kaaran brahman yaa yon kahen puraa savarna tabaka in donon partiyon kii mukhaalafat karne par amada he
 Those who stood with BSP in 2007 due to the social engineering of Savarna Mayawati are now turning to Congress and BJP
 ’thakur samudaay main isi tarah ke ravaie kaa izhaar karte hue jhaansi mandal kshatriya samaaj ke adhyaksh shailendra singh bundela kehete hai, ‘pichley chunaav ke pehle mere netritv main saikadon kshatriya basapa ke sadsy bane the
 But the manner in which the Kshatriyas were neglected and insulted by the BSP, the watery Thakur community can never be forgotten
 ’ haalanki brahman or thakur samudaay ke in numaayindon kii raay ko in samudaayon kii aam raay nahin mana ja saktaa lekin ise puri tarah khaarij karne kii vajah bhi najar nahin aati
 However, the BSP and SP have left no stone unturned to keep the forward castes with them
 agar sabhi partiyon ke ummmidavaaron par najar daalen to pataa chalata he ki basapa ne 117, sapa ne 116, congress ne 116 or bhaajapa ne sabase adhik 180 savarnon par bharosa jataayaa he
 bjp's expectations are also higher than upper caste voters for assembly elections
 party ne apane ghoshnaa patr main bihar kii tarj par soobe main bhi savarna ayog banane or garib savarnon ko aarakshan dene kii baat kahi he
 Lalji Tandon, a senior party leader and MP from Lucknow, says, "the SP and BSP governments have neglected the upper castes and are angry with this class now leaning towards the BJP
" ’ saath main ve party line ke mutabik yah kahana nahin bhoolatey, ‘bhaajapa keval savarna hi nahin balki samaaj ke sabhi virgon ko saath lekar chalane kii baat kah rahi he
 'union minister and Congress leader Pradeep Jain Aditya says,' Brahmins and upper castes were insulted in the BSP
 yah varg ab congress ke saath he

 When Salman entered Amrita's party, he would not have imagined that he would be facing his most arch-enemy Shahrukh
 salmaan jab aae to unka mood kapi acha tha
 Salman first collided with Mirza
 diya ne pehle dur se hi salmaan ko dua salaam kiya lekin shaayad salmaan ko acha nahin laga salmaan ne diya se kuch kaha or phir diya ne salmaan ko gale lagaakar alavida kaha or vahaan se chalati baniin
 Diya had come out and Salman went inside
 salmaan aae to the blue tii shart pahanakar lekin andar unhone safed shart pahan lee or is mastaani shaam kaa lutf lene lage
 The interesting thing was that Salman was not with Katrina but stood away from Katrina
 salmaan apane main mast te to katrina apane main mast
 Both were jiggling and Katrina was jammed in her hands and she was cool in herself, so Salman was taking off his shirt and showing his body to someone
 is bich katrina ke saath khadey atul kasbekar salmaan par genden kaa phool phenkate hai
 Katrina's lover Salman does not like this, Salman flares up on Katrina
 salmaan kaa gussa abhi khatm hua hi nahin tha kii salmaan se takaraa jate hai shahrukh ke sabase kareebi dost karan johar
 Salman was seen talking to Shahrukh's beloved Karan for a long time and while Karan was silently listening to Salman
 karan karte bhi kya unke dost shahrukh kii abhi tak entry jo nahin hui thim
 Shah Rukh's anger was coming out on Salman Shaid Karan while Salman's brother Sohail was standing and dancing on the table with fun
 naachne gane kaa ye silsilaa derrat tak chalaa
 Salman looked very much in control when he came out
 salmaan ne kuch der tak media ke saamne khadey hokar photo khinchvaai phir pados main khadey dost ko bataane lage media ke sawaal
 When Aaj Tak correspondent Neeru Sharma questioned Salman about Shahrukh, then Salman got agitated
 salmaan ab yahaan se jald se jald janaa chaah rahe the gaadi kaa intjaar naa hua to salmaan ne aato me baithkar hi yahaan se nikalnaa behatar samajha

 In the Lok Sabha on Wednesday, Home Minister Amit Shah said that during the voyage of foreign travel, Prime Minister Modi chooses to rest or bathe at the airport terminals instead of spending the night at the Five Star Hotel
 shah ne kaha "apane vyaktigat or saarvajanik jivan main piem modi ne ek bahut hi anushaasit vyavastha kaa paalan kiya he
 For example, whenever PM Modi goes abroad, he takes less than 20% of his staff with him
 isi tarah aadhikarik pratinidhimandal ke liye badi sankhya main kaaron ke istemaal par bhi unhone lagaam lagaai he
 Earlier officers used to go in different cars but now they go together in bus or any big vehicle

 The Congress manifesto released on Saturday for Madhya Pradesh assembly elections showed a glimpse of soft Hindutva
 lekin saath hi congress ne rajya kii sarkari imaaraton or parisaron main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (RSS) kii shakhaon par pabandi lagane kii ghoshnaa kar party or adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke un daavon ko or majboot kar diya jisamen wo aresas par nafrat failaane ke aarope lagaate rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the BJP has objected to this announcement of the Congress
 congress ne apane vachan patr main kaha he ki yadi party madhya pradesh kii satta main aati he to sarkari imaaraton or parisaron main aresas kii shakha lagane kii ijaajat nahin di jaaegi
 The order allowing government employees to participate in the branch will also be canceled
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi aksar sangh par nishaanaa sadhate rahete hai
 Declaring against the branch in Madhya Pradesh elections is being seen as an extension of Rahul Gandhi's vision
 # Congressin its manifesto in # madhyapradeshhas said if the party comes to power then RSS 'shakhas' would not be allowed in Government buildings and premises, also earlier order to allow Govt employees to attend RSS 'shakhas' will be revoked

 com / xucrsbcy9f — ANI (@ANI) November 11, 2018 However, on the other hand, the Congress' promissory note reflected a soft Hindutva
 bhagwaan ram, narmada, gauvansh or gomutra kaa ullekh karte hue madhya pradesh congress samiti ne vidhansabha chunaav ke liye shanivaar ko apana jo ghoshnaptr jari kiya he usamen party kaa 'soft hindutv' vaala cheharaa pesh karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he
 BJP has expressed its objection to the promise of banning the RSS branch in government buildings in the promise letter of the BJP
 bijepi pravaktaa or bhopal se bijepi saansad alok sanger ne congress par palatwaar karte hue kaha he ki congress ko sangh ke bare main pehle samajhnaa chahie
 It should be closely examined
 uske baad wo aisi baat nahi karenge
 Sanjar also denied the allegation of the Congress having a branch of RSS in government buildings
 unhone kaha ki aresas kii shakhaaen maidan main lagati hai yaa phir sangh kii apni sampattiyon main naa ki shaskeey bhawanon main
 Sanjar said that nationalism is taught in the branches of the RSS and i would like to remind the Congress that if a disaster strikes in the country, the Swayamsevak of the Sangh reaches first
 vahiin aresas kii shakha main sarkari karmchaariyon par roak lagane ke vaade par bhi bijepi ne sawaal uthaaya he ki sarkari karmchaariyon par roak lagane kii baat kyon kii? ye loktantr he
 Anyone can connect with anyone's idea
 'jehar failaate hai shakha main jane vaale karmchaarimadhya pradesh congress ke varisht netaa maanak agarwal ne aarope lagaaya he ki aresas kii shakha main jane ke baad apane daftaron main karmchaariyon ke bich zehar failaane kaa kaam karte hai or logon ne bhed karte hai
 That is why Congress has written in its promissory note to ban government employees from going to RSS branches

 While on the one hand, the CM of the state, KCR, appears completely confident of taking over the power of the state for the second time, on the other hand, the Congress, TDP, Left and Telangana Action Committee are preparing to join hands and defeat KCR
 Huh
 jabaki, bijepi or AIMIM king mekar banane ke liye jaddojahad kar rahe hai
 Let us know that in the 119-seat assembly of Telangana, kcr's party TRS has 90 mlas
 bijepi ko keval 5 vidhayakon se santosh karnaa padaa tha
 While Congress got 13, TDP got 3 CPI one seat
 vahiin, ovaisi kii party AIMIM ke 7 vidhayak hai
 The TRS fort in the state of Telangana state formed in 2014 is still looking strong
 kesiar ne paanch saal main jis tarah se apni party or sanghathan kaa vistaar kiya he, vaisaa bijepi sahit duusari party nahin kar saki hai
 However, to defeat KCR, the Congress has joined hands with the TDP, forgetting their enmity
 congress, tidipi, left or telugana ection cameti ne gathbandhan kiya he
 However, Congress is contesting 90 seats in this alliance
 baaki bachi 29 siten sahyogi dal ke khaaten gai he
 Telangana in South India also has a significant number of Muslim voters
 lihaaja asaduddin ovaisi kii party AIMIM king mekar banane kii koshish main he
 Owaisi has a solid vote bank due to which he currently has seven mlas
 haalanki congress sahit kai party ovaisi or kesiar ke beet parde ke peeche gathbandhan kaa aarope lagaati he
 In Telangana, the BJP is making every effort to feed the lotus
 lekin bijepi ke liye tiares ke vot main sendhamari karnaa paanaa tedi kheer he
 However, according to BJP sources, the party's goal is to win so many seats in the Telangana assembly elections, on which it can play the role of kingmaker while forming the government in the state
 bijepi ne telugana main 20 se zyada siten jeetne kaa lakshya rakhaa he
 At present there are 5 party mlas
 lekin, ab party ne is sankhya ko badhaane par apana puraa focus kar rakhaa he
 The National Conference of BJP Yuva Morcha was called in Hyderabad only to prepare the equation for the Telangana and the ground of electoral victory there
 congress ke varisht netaa es jaipal reddy ne ravivaar ko aarope lagaaya ki telugana main tiares or bijepi ke bich aghoshit se zyada kaa gathbandhan he or sambhav he ki donon partiyaan vidhansabha chunaav ke baad haath mila len
 Actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan is also trying his political career
 kalyaan kii jan sena party basapa ke saath gathbandhan kar sakati he
 Pawan Kalyan also met BSP chief Mayawati last month in this regard
 haalanki basapa ne 119 siton par apane ummidavaar utaare hai, lekin jan sena party ke liye kuch siten chhodane kii baat kahi thi
 The party was formed in 2014 by Pawan Kalyan, younger brother of South Superstar Chiranjeevi

 com / 7iykglp6eg — ANI UP (@aninewsup) August 7, 2016 kisi mudde ko bahakaana ho to ye kaise hota he ye maharashtra vidhansabha main jo buudhvaar ko hua usase sikh leni chahie
 Owaisi's party AIMIM MLA Waris Pathan was suspended from the assembly session by the leaders of the entire party because he refused to speak Bharat Mata ki Jai
 upar se dekhne par ye baat sahi bhi lagati he, khaskar javed akhtar ke rajyasabha main hue bhaashan ke baad kibharat mata kii jaibolne par aapatti kya he
 The heir kept saying again and again that he would speak Jai Hind but Bharat Mata ki Jai
 vaaris pathan peshey se vakil hai or kanoon ke jaankaar hai
 So, keeping a finger on the law, he kept saying that no one can force them
 lekin mudda kanoon kaa nahin bhaawanaaon kaa he or bevajaah ise ahmiyat mil rahi he
 The controversy started from Bal Thackeray's memorial, there was an issue in the matter, discussion was being held on some other subject and the matter reached Bharat Mata ki Jai
 sadan main rajyapal ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav par charchaa chal rahi thi
 Imtiaz Jalil, the MLA from AIMIM, was speaking in opposition to this proposal
 shivasena pramukh bal thakare kaa smarak banane ke liye sarkaar dwaara paise dene kaa virodh karte hue kaha ki taxperes kaa paisa shivasena-bijepi ke netaaon kaa smarak banane ke liye kyon kharch ho rahaa he? us par aapatti jataate hue shivasena bijepi vidhayakon ne unase poocha kii kya wo chhatrapati shivaji ke smarak kaa bhi virodh kar rahe hai
 Actually the Maharashtra government is going to make a grand effigy of Chhatrapati Shivaji in the Arabian Sea
 vijay maalya ko lekar bhi bahasmaamala uthaa to sadan main shivaji maharaj kii jai or bharat mata kii jai ke naare lagane lage
 BJP MLA Ram Kadam asked MIM mlas to speak Bharat Mata ki Jai
 is par jaleel ne inkaar kiya or kaha vijay maalya bharat mata kii jai bolte hue 9000 karod rupee kaa chuunaa lagaakar bhaag gaye hai
 Meanwhile, Waris Pathan challenged the Shiv Sena BJP mlas that they would not say Bharat Mata ki Jai and then the matter reached suspensions
 mudda kuch or kahin or pahunch gaya
 It was also made in 1998 that such a situation is right that nobody should have objected to speak of Bharat Mata ki Jai, but the speech on the Governor's address went elsewhere
 lagata he ye ek tarika ban chukaa he
 a similar incident took place in 1998
 jagah vahi maharashtra vidhansabha
 And the government of Shiv sena-bjp
 charchaa chal rahi thi mumbai dangon par bane shrikrishna kamishan kii report par jisamen shivasena pramukh bal thakare par dosha rakhaa gaya tha
 The Shiv sena-bjp government headed by Chief Minister Manohar Joshi had made up its mind to reject the report
 manohar joshi ne is par chal rahi charchaa ke jawaab main kaha ki agar shivasena nahin hoti to 1992 ke dangon main mumbai nahin bachati
 The Congress and SP had expressed their objection, members of the Congress and Samajwadi Party objected to this statement
 jiske baad manohar joshi ne samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak sohail lokhandwala kii taraf ishaara karte hue kaha ki sadan kii kaaywahi khatm hote samay kuch log vande maataram nahin bolte
 We will keep an eye on him
 sohail lokhandwala ne is par ye kehete hue aapatti jataai ki musalmaan vande maataram nahin bolte kyonki wo murti puja nahin karte
 After this, the controversy started over not saying Vande Mataram
 gauratlab he ki 1992 ke dangon ke baad 1995 main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main mumbai main voton kaa dharmik dhruvikaran ho chukaa tha, jisamen congress mumbai main 34 main se 1 seat par simat gai thi jabaki nai bani samaajawaadee party mumbai main 3 siten jiti thim
 The Congress suffered heavy losses due to leaning towards the Samajwadi Party, the base of minority votes
 vidhansabha kii dibet ko dekh kar lag rahaa tha ki vande maataram ke naam par ye dhruvikaran pukhta karne kii koshish thi
 However, many in the Samajwadi Party objected to the role of Sohail Lokhandwala in saying no to Vande Mataram, saying that Ashfaq Ulla Khan had also given the slogan of Vande Mataram while hanging
 lekin is vivaad kaa phayda donon ko tha samaajawaadee party ko bhi or shivasena bijepi ko bhi
 MIM vs bjp-shiv Sena is going to fight In today's situation, the strength of MIM is increasing in Maharashtra
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main do siten jitkar party ne apana khaataa kholaa lekin isse pehle hi marathavada main aurangabad, nanded, latur saath hi sholapur or mumbai me party ne apane paanv jamaana shuru kar diya tha
 This is causing trouble for the Congress
 congress satta main aati he tab marathavada or mumbai main party kaa parformens acha hota he or isamen alpsankhyak voton kaa majboot haath hota he
 If Owaisi's party has started hollowing out this base, the more the MIM versus BJP or Shiv Sena in the future, the more the Congress has to suffer
 phir usamen kabhi vande maataram hoga to kabhi bharat mata kii jai kaa naaraa hoga

 Considering the request for a hearing on this matter as soon as possible, the court has decided to sit at 10 am on Monday, half an hour before the normal daily working hours

 unhone kaha ki ve na to kabhi pakistan jaakar koi kaarykram kiya he or na hi karenge
 Ghazal singer Anoop Jalota said that they welcome the action taken by the Indian government
 unhone kaha ki ve sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai
 Anoop Jalota said that the kind of respect that is given to the artists of Pakistan is not given to the artists of India in Pakistan
 anup jalota ne ye bhi kaha ki aaj kii taarikh main pakistan kii sthiti kahin munh dikhaane ke laayak nahin he
 He said that Pakistan is roaming around after a surgical strike
 pakistan ke aatankwaadiyon ko bhartiya sena ne uske hi ghar main maar giraaya
 Anoop Jalota said he is proud of his army

 The Supreme Court pronounced its verdict on Thursday on the 1994 Ismail Farooqui case
 supreme court ke faisle ke mutabik 1994 maamle ko badi bench ko bhejne kii jarurat nahin he
 The court said that we would need to understand the 1994 judgment
 supreme court ke is faisle par punarvichaar karne ke liye muslim pakshakaron kii ore se yachika daakhil kii gai thi, jis par chif justise deepak mishra kii aguwai vaali bench ne 20 july ko faisla surakshit rakhaa tha
 What was Ismail Farooqui's case? In Ayodhya, kar sevaks demolished Babarimjid on 6 December 1992
 iske baad centre sarkaar ne 7 janvari, 1993 ko adhyadesh laakayodhyaamein 67 acre jameen kaa adhigrahan kar liya tha
 Under this, 120x80 feet of the disputed land was also acquired which is called Babri masjid-ram Janmabhoomi complex
 centre sarkaar ke isi faisle ko ismail faruki ne supreme court main chunauti dete hue apni yachika main kaha tha ki dharmik sthal kaa sarkaar kaise adhigrahan kar sakati he
 Hearing this, the apex court had said that namazpadhan nislam is not an essential part of the mosque
 supreme court ke is faisle par muslim samudaay sahamat nahin he
 They want the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision
 muslim samudaay yah bhi chahta he ki ayodhya main vivaadit jameen ke malikana haq se jude cese main faisle se pehle 1994 ke ismail faruki maamle par aae faisle par nae sire se vichaar ho
 Explain that on July 7 this year, when a three-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice was hearing a case related to the ownership of disputed land in Ayodhya, the Muslim side's lawyer Rajiv Dhawan said that offering Namaz in the mosque is an essential part of Islam
 Whether it is or not, the matter was referred to the Constitution Bench
 unki daleel thi muslim samudaay kii daleelon ko dhyaan se suna or parkhaa jaae
 During the hearing, Rajiv Dhawan had said that Islam is the religion of collectivity
 vaise to namaaj kahin bhi padhi ja sakati he, lekin jab shuukravaar ko samuhik namaaj hoti he to masjid main use padhaa jaataa he
 He said that this tradition is there since the beginning of Islam in the whole world
 muslim pakshakaar mohammad khalid kehete hai ki is sambandh main hamane quran kii 24 aayatein supreme court ko saunpi hai, jinase yah sabit hota he ki masjid main namaaj padhanaa islam kaa mukhya ang he
 At the same time, Hindu parties say that if the hearing in this case starts again, it can have an impact on the hearing of the main case related to the title suit
 bataa den ki supreme court yadi is maamle ko samvidhan kii badi bench ke paas bhej detaa he to mukhya maamle kii sunwaayee lambey samay tak atak sakati he

 You must have seen a lot of legends, but have you seen wrestling with veil too? wo bhi saikadon kii sankhya main mahilaayein ghunghat kii aad lekar akhaade main utar padati hon

 This practice was started to prepare women to fight against the British army, but it is still intact hundreds of years later

 At the same time, on the day this veil-laden women riot takes place, the men of the village are taken out of the village and the lathit women are guarded so that no man can become an eyewitness to their wrestling
 yahi vah jagah bhi he jahaan se pehali baar mahila kushti kii shuruuaat hui thi

 kushti ke akhaade main mahilaayein puri pardedaari ke saath utrin
 This unique competition of veil-clad wrestling daw screw thrilled everyone
 kaise hui is kushti kii shuruyaatye pratha kareeb dhai sau saal puraani he
 When the British army occupied all the places of the country and started attacking the Hindus, the women too jumped up to fight against them
 apni asmat kii khatir mahilaon ne bundelkhand ke hamirpur jile ke kai gaanv ko ek kiya or phir mahilaon ko ladaai ke liye taiyaar kiya
 At that time, the veil system was dominant in all of Bundelkhand, so keeping this in mind, women started reaching the veil in the veil itself
 vahaan unhone kushti or ladaai ke gur siikhe phir angrejon se bhid gayi
 Even today, the veil wrestling is organized in Lodipur Nivada village of Muskara region of the district, keeping the old tradition alive
 gram panchayat sanchaalan samiti kii malti devi shukla kahati hai, yah kaaphi puraani pratha he jo mahilaon ko aatmanirbhar or shashakt banane kaa massej detii he
 In Bundelkhand, Maharani Laxmibai was not the only heroine who fought against the British, but in Hamirpur before that women had landed against the British army
 gaanv kii lakshmi devi kahati hai gaanv main kushti ke samay koi bhi purush gaanv main pravesh nahin kar saktaa
 Even today the women of this village practice wrestling
 kisko kisne di patkhni?bataate hai ki dangal main calosia munni devi ke bich kushti hui jis par calosia ne munni devi ko akhaade main patake diya

 In the world of crime, live pictures of a shootout are rarely seen
 ek criminal car main bhaag rahaa thi
 The car was running faster than 100 kilometers per hour
 wo ek haath se car chalaa rahaa tha or duusare haath se police kii car par goliyaan
 You know yourself what happens next in this report
 
 
 badmaashon ne police par kii 34 round firing
 Police fired 32 rounds on miscreants
 chalati gaadi main sabase bada encounter
 LIVE recording of this entire shootout was taking place
 jo khud badmaashon kaa saamana karne vaala police afasar kar rahaa tha
 On July 11, 2018, 4:30 pm, two notorious miscreants named Las Vegas, America, Fidel Miranda and René Nuñaz got out of their black SUV and shot a 25-year-old young man from Los Vegas
 yuvak kii maukey par hi maut ho gai
 This PCR van of the police got information about the incident and this policeman chased the miscreants and warned them to stop
 magar rukne ke bajaae badmaashon ne ulte apni car kii speed badha di
 This policeman also increased the speed of his car and got behind the miscreants
 badmaash apni car kii speed tej karte ja rahe the orpulisavalahar maanane ko taiyaar nahin tha
 While with the steering of the car in one hand, it held the walkie talkie in its other hand
 jisase wo lagaataar controlroom ko apadet de rahaa tha
 During this time he was also seeking help from the control room as the miscreants were constantly firing at him
 goliyaan chalane kii awaz lagaataar us camere main record ho raheen thi
 Which this policeman had put on the body
 badmaash signal todate ja rahe the
 But this policeman also remained behind him continuously
 ek pal ko jab us pulisavaale ko laga ki badmaash apni esayuvi se bhaagane main kaamyaab ho sakate hai, to isane fouran control room se air unit maangi
 The suspect was in contact with the car chasing officer control room
 pulisavaala lagaataar byaap maang rahaa tha
 After another 3 minutes of chasing alone, another police car reaches for backup
 magar badmaashon kii car kii speed itani zyaada thi ki wo peeche chhot jaati he
 So this policeman felt that if the crooks got out of hand, then he took out his revolver
 ab pulisavaale ke ek haath main revolver thi to duusare haath main gaadi kii stering
 At first it tried to fire from its left side
 magar angel naa banane kii vajah se nishaanaa sateek nahin baith rahaa tha
 On the other hand, crooks were constantly firing
 lihaaza is police adhikari ne apni hi car ke windscreen par revolver se paanch fire kar shishe main chhed kar diya
 And then it responded to the firing of the miscreants by firing bullets from this hole
 lekin sandigdh car abhi bhi nahin ruki
 So the police officer used revolvers with both hands and fired several bullets one after the other
 tab jaakar kahin kaali gaadi kii raftaar kam hui
 That is also because one of the policemen shoots one of these two crooks
 police adhikari car ke shishe se ek baar phir firing karata hai
 And the vehicle collides with the shore after disassembly
 ek badmaash bhaagane kii koshish karata he magar police vaala unhen bhaagane kaa mauka hi nahin detaa
 The policeman opens the car door and reloads the revolver
 apni posishan lekar dobaaraa firing shuru kar detaa he
 In this film encounter, one crook is killed while the other is arrested by the police
 ye video los vegas police ne apane police adhikariyon kaa haunsala badhaane or badmaashon kaa hausala post karne ke liye khud jari kiya he

 In the Lok Sabha elections 2014, the issue of economy proved to be important and the voter showed the way out to the UPA government led by Manmohan Singh
 may 2014 main narendra modi ke netritv main bani nai endie sarkaar se voter ke alaava vaishvik niveshkon ne badi ummid baandhi
 Investors were confident that this new government would not only put the economy of the world's largest democracy on the right path, but would also work to overcome the economic challenges facing the country at a rapid pace
 loksabhaa chunaav ek baar phir dastak de rahe hai
 The Modi government has probably not forgotten that expectation of investors and voters and now in the last year of its tenure, it is trying to make the economic data in its favor, which will be monitored by global investors and voters
 jidipi: beete teen saal ke dauraan desh main jidipi ke aankalan ko lekar vivaad kii sthiti bani hui he
 In 2015, after the Modi government's first year tenure, the Department of Statistics of the Central Government (CSO) made a major change in the methodology, altering the fiscal year fixed for estimating GDP
 is parivartan kaa nateeja yah rahaa ki kendra sarkaar ko jidipi vikaas dar kaa bada aankada mila
 For example, according to the new formula where GDP growth rate in FY 2013-14 is 6
 2 fisadi darj hui vahiin puraane formule main yah mahaj 4
 8 percent is recorded
 is dauraan khaas aankade utpaadan kshetra se milte hai kyonki purana formula jahaan utpaadan vikaas dar -2 fisadi darj karata he vahiin nayaa formula iskaa aankalan 6 fisadi karata he
 In the midst of this uncertainty, what is the real growth rate of the country, it has to be done by the Central Government before the general elections because if this uncertainty persists, it may have suffered in the elections
 petrol dijal or mahangaai: modi sarkaar ko 2014 main desh kii kaman milane ke baad vaishvik bazaar main kachche tel kii keemton main badi giravat darj hona shuru ho gaya
 Before 2014, during the tenure of the Manmohan Singh government, crude oil broke into the global market with a big inflation crisis in the country
 vahiin 2015, 2016 or 2017 ke dauraan kaccha tel apane record nunatam str par rahaa jiske chalate kendra sarkaar ko rajasav main phayda hone ke saath-saath mahangaai par lagaam lagane main badi madad mili
 But now there is less than a year left in the general elections and the price of crude oil is increasing continuously in the global market
 nateeja yah he ki maujuuda samay main desh main petrol-dijal kii keemten apane sheersh par pahunch chuki he or mahangaai ke badhate aankade kendra sarkaar ko lagaataar pareshaan kar rahe hai
 If the global crude oil price rises in this election year, it will be a challenge for the ruling party to handle the opposition's attack in the elections
 lihaaja, kachche tel kii badhati keemton se bad rahepetrol-dijal kii keemtpar lagaam lagane kii jarurat he jisase mahangaai kaa aankada chunavi mudda na banane paae
 Employment: The Central Government claims that there is no problem of employment in the country but the problem of employment figures
 beete ek saal ke dauraan kai kendriya mantriyon samet pradhanmantri daawa kar chuke hai ki unke kaarykaal ke dauraan jarurat ke mutabik naukariyon kaa srijan kiya gaya he lekin inamen se zyaadaatar naukariyaan sarkari aankadon main shaamil nahin kii ja saki hai
 The government argues that there is a need to change the decades-old formula used in the country to calculate new jobs of the new era
 sarkaar kii is dalilko rigerv bank, state bank of india or im bangaloru se sambhddha arthshaastri bhi maanate hai or daleel ko aage badhaate hai ki kendra sarkaar ke ipiefo ke aankade rojgaar kii sateek gananaa karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hai
 At the same time, the Center for Economic Government does not agree with the argument and claims that despite the rapid economic pace in the country, jobs are not being created as per the requirement
 lihaaja, ab kendra sarkaar ko chahie ki chunaavon se pehle is matbhed ko dur karte hue apana aankada sunishchit kare ki kya desh main uske karyakal ke dauraan rojgaar ke aankadon main sudhaar hua he yaa nahin

 Search operation is going on at the scene
 nae saal ko dekhte hue ghati main suraksha vyavastha ko pukhta kiya gaya he
 The terrorists are constantly plotting to attack in the valley
 bataa den ki jaish-e-mohammad ke kuch aatankiyon ke ghati main ghusane kii khabar he
 It is being told that jaish-e-mohammed's master Masood Azhar has started sending his terrorists to Kashmir
 sutron kii maane to beete maheene nau disambar ko ghati main abdul rashid gaji ko bheja he
 Rashid Ghazi has been given the responsibility to prepare new terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir and create havoc here

 Even before this, Abdul Rashid Ghazi has given training to many terrorists to conduct weapons, explode

 This operation, which has been going on for the last two years, has broken the back of the terrorists
 2018 main hi surakshabalon ne kareeb 250 aatankiyon ko jananath bhej diya he

 bahut se maa-baap ko ye lagata he ki wo apane bachche ko dhul-mitti or bahari maahaul se jitna bachaakar rakhenge, baccha utana hi swasth rahegaa
 But is that really so? off course not
 dhul-mitti se bachaakar rakhane ke baavjood aise bachche aksar biimaar pad jate hai jabaki gaanvon main dhul, mitti or khule main khilne vaale bachche apekshaakrit zyada swasth rahete hai
 Some of the same thinking is about chewing nails and sucking the thumb
 aamtaur par aisa mana jaataa he ki angootha chusna or nakhun chabana buree aadat he, jisase bachche biimaar pad jate he
 Parents fear that many types of bacteria will enter the child's body, which can make the child sick
 lekin ye baat puri tarah se sach nahin he
 According to a recent study, the immune system of such children is much stronger and more developed than those who do not
 newjiland main hue is shodh ke anusaar, nakhun chabane vaale or angootha chusane valebache kam biimaar padate hai
 For this study, scientists conducted some necessary tests on more than a thousand children
 is pareekshan ko Pediatrics main prakashit kiya gaya he
 This study found that the parents who told their children that they drank the thumb and ate nails, their immune system improved further
 is adhyayan ke liye 5, 7, 9 or 11 saal ke bacchon ke mata-pita se unki aadaton ke bare main poocha gaya tha
 After that when these children were 13 years old, their skin was tested
 unki twachaa par saamaanya sankraman, dhul, mitti, paaltu jaanwaron ke sampark or ghaas se hone vaale sankraman kaa pareekshan kiya gaya
 a similar test was done when he turned 32 years old
 aise bachche jo aksar apana angootha chuusate the or nakhun chabate the, unamem infections hone kaa khatra kam paaya gaya
 The reasoning behind this study is that due to the habit of chewing nails and thumb sucking, the immune system is prepared in the child to fight the bacteria of the external environment
 adhyayankarta robert je hancox ke anusaar, bacchon ko har samay kaid karke rakhana yaa phir un par bahut adhik paabandiyaan lagaana khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 With this, their immune system is not able to develop according to the external environment
 haalanki adhyayankarta is baat ko sweekaar karte hai ki bachche main safai kii aadat honi chahie
 By staying clean, we can avoid many diseases
 dilli main emsidi chunaav se ek din pehle aravind kejariwal ke puraane saathi or swaraj abhiyaan ke sadsy yogendra yadav ne siem kejariwal ko ek chitthee likhi he
 Yogendra Yadav in his letter has blamed Kejriwal for the mess and bad conditions of Delhi
 unhone likhaa ki kejariwal ne dilli kii janata kaa vishwaas todaa he
 Also, referring to the promises of the Aam Aadmi Party, he wrote that Kejriwal has tried to gain votes by greed, fear and intimidation from the people of Delhi
 yogendra yadav kaa arvind kejariwal ne naam patrapriy aravind,do saal pehle dilli ne jo aitihaasik janadesh diya tha, wo kisi ek netaa yaa party kaa karishma nahin tha
 Behind him was the sacrifice and austerity of thousands of Volunteers
 lekin is karishme kaa sabase bada kaaran tha dilli kii janata kaa aatmbal
 The Jan Lokpal movement assured millions of citizens of Delhi that they are not poor
 wo netaaon, partiyon or sarkaron se zyada taqatvar hai
 Today i am seeing that self-confidence wavering
 isliye pichley do saal main pehali baar aapse samvaad kar rahaa hoon or aapako ramlila maidan main kiye ricol ke vaade kii yaad dil rahaa hoon
 In the last month, i got a chance to go to every corner of Delhi during the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) elections
 dilli main chaaron taraf kooday ke dher hai, ganda pani rukaa hua he, badboodaar or khatarnaak hawa he
 Everyone knows that its first responsibility is that of the BJP ruling the MCD for the last ten years
 lekin phir bhibijepi besharmi se is chunaav main khadi he, vot maang rahi he
 There are many voters who voted for a historic change in 2015, but who are going back to the BJP this time of defeat and defeat
 main pichley maheene bhar se soch rahaa hoon ki is nikkami or bhrasht sarkaar ko chalane vaali bijepi ko MCD chunaav main khadey hone kaa mauka dene ke liye koun jimmevaar he
 After much thinking, i came to the conclusion that you are personally responsible for this Delhi accident
 aapane dilli kii janata kaa vishwaas todaa he
 Faith is not broken by just one leader or party
 janata kaa khud apane aap se vishwaas tutaa he -- aap se dhokhaa khaane ke baad unhen lagata he ki unhen achche-bure kii pahchaan nahin he
 That is why many people with broken minds are going to the same old parties which they rejected two years ago
 loktantr main janata kii aashaa jagaakar use todna bahut bada paap he
 The biggest crime is to undermine public confidence
 mainyah kehane ko majaboor hunki apane ahankaar, aatm-moh or kursi ke laalach main aapane yah aparaadh kiya he
 i do not just say this, everybody says this in every locality and street of Delhi
 is chunaav prachaar ke dauraan aapane voter ko jis tarah laalach, dar or dhamkee deen he usame mujhe "vinaashkale vipareet buddhi" ke lakshan dikhaai dete hai
 Obviously you will not agree with me
 aapane baar-baar kaha he ki dilli kii janata aapke saath he
 The election of tomorrow's MCD in Delhi has been transformed into a reference to his own personal popularity
 aapaki party sirf aapke naam par vot maang rahi he
 The party does not even have a name in the hoarding
 aapaki party ne ek internal survey bhi jari kiya he ki aapaki party ko MCD chunaav main 218 siten lekar jeet rahi he
 i have a proposal agar aapako is chunaav main tino MCD main kul milakar bahumat (yani sirf 137 siten) aa jaataa he to main yah maan loonga ki meri samaj galat he or dilli kii janata aapako dhokheybaaj nahin maanati
 In such a situation, if the central government does any conspiracy against your government, then our party and myself will support you
 lekin agar dilli main 70 main se 67 seat jeetne ke do saal main hi aap is referendom main haar jate hai to naitikta kii maang he ki aap EVM jaisaa koi bahaanaa naa banaaen, mukhyamantri pad se istifa de den or aapaki sarkaar dilli main 'ricol' ke siddhant ke anusaar dubaara janata se vishwaas mat hasil kare

 According to the state's Agriculture Minister Brijmohan Agrawal, hundreds of families of tribal areas have been linked with the Karkanath cock farming business by providing financial assistance

 modi ne kaha ki unhen is sambandh main ab tak koi aadhikarik soochna nahin mili he
 He said, 'for the last two days there have been many apprehensions and conflicting reports in the media about the issuance or request of Blue Corner notice by the Enforcement Directorate or on its basis

 a copy of this letter has also been sent to the Ministry of Finance
 modi ne kaha, ‘na hi mujhase, na hi pravartan nideshaalay ke saath baatcheet kar rahe vakeelon or na hi mere vakil mahmud abdi ko is sambandh main koi soochna di gai he
 In view of this huge uncertainty, i request you to please inform me of the actual situation so that i can understand the situation and seek legal advice
 ’modi ne kaha, ‘yadi vastav main blue carnor notice jari kiya gaya he yaa blue carnor notice jari karne kaa anurodh kiya gaya he to is paristhiti main yah meri vyaktigat swatantraaa main atyadhik hastkshep hoga
 Modi said that he is fully cooperating with the administration and has told him about the reasons for not appearing before the directorate in India, yet such actions against him are not justified
 modi nilaamee main vittiya aniyamitata, chhadam tareeke se sampatti rakhane, ipel ke prasaaran samjhaute main rishwat lene samet 22 aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe hai

 ' uttar pradesh kii rajdhani lakhanu main pichley saal hatya kii ek vaardaat ne puure police mahakme ko hilaakar rakh diya tha
 The deceased was a property dealer in the city
 jise aadhi raat ke vakt goli markar maut ke ghat utaar diya gaya tha
 The police did one day and night to solve the murder
 or jab maamle kaa khulaasa hua to hakeekat jaanakar har koi sann rah gaya
 This is how the murderer of Zaid jaid shakeel yuva netaa hone ke saath-saath property dealer bhi tha
 He was fond of cricket matches
 vaardaat ke din yani 4 june 2016 ko aadhi raat ke vakt vah apane dost farhaan ke saath ek nit cricket match dekhakar waapas ghar kii taraf ja rahaa tha
 That's when two bike riders came back from the rear of Anjuman Cinema on Aishbagh's Waterworks Road and started firing at Zaid
 is dauraan jaid ko kai goli lagi
 While Farhan survived
 vaardaat main jaid kii maut ho chuki thi
 This news spread sensation all over the city of Lucknow
 espi krime ne sanbhali jaanch kii kamanamritak jaid kaa sambandh prabhaavshaalee parivaar se tha
 His father Shakeel is a big businessman of firecrackers
 or sanbhal ke purv saansad or varisht netaa shafirkurahaman bark rishte main uske naanaa lagate hai
 He was also a youth leader
 lihaaja uski hatya kii maamla police ke liye kisi chunauti se kam nahin tha
 Earlier, the police felt that the matter could be related to any property dispute
 kyonki jaid property kaa kaam karata tha
 No important clues were coming to the case
 tab is cese ko lakhanu ke tej tarraar espi krime dow
 Sanjay Kumar took it into his own hands
 servilans kii madadpulice ne sabase pehle mritak ke mobile phone kii jaanch kii
 Then his CDR was taken out
 uske aadhaar par jaid ke aas-paas or milane waalon ke phone police ne servilans par laga die
 During this time, Zaid's friend Farhan got some doubt from the call record to the police
 ye vahi farhaan thi jo vaardaat kii raat bike chalaa rahaa tha, or jaid uske peeche baitha tha
 The police decided to interrogate Farhan and summoned Farhan
 Must Read:jaanwaron ke saath kukarm kar maar daalata tha jisha kaa hatyaraise hua tha farhaan par shakapulice ko shaq tha ki jis raste se hameshaa jaid ghar aata tha, vaardaat ke din vah duusare raste se kyon aayaa tha
 Because he was with Farhan that night, the needle of suspicion of the police was moving towards him
 hamalaavaron ne itani goliyaan chalaai lekin farhaan kaise batch gaya, ye sawaal bhi use shaq ke daayre main khadaa kar rahaa tha
 Initially, Farhan kept trying to trick the police
 police uski phone detel bhi khangaal rahi thi
 But later he broke down in front of the police
 afaire bana jaid kii maut kaa sababfarhaan ne is hatyakand kii parate kholani shuru kii
 Police learned that Salim, a notorious criminal and serial killer in Tihar Jail, Delhi, had hatched the plot
 darasal, saleem kii jaid se jaan pahchaan thi
 But after he went to jail, Zaid and his wife Anjum Ara became close to each other
 donon saath-saath ghoomane jate the
 Both of them were seen together many times
 jab is baat kaa pataa saleem ko chalaa to usne jaid ko thikaane lagane kaa man bana liya
 Which required a shooter
 Must Read:dilli main aise rachi gai thi do ladakiyon ke katl kii khooni sajeesharelway stesan par katl kii planningdrasal, jaid kii hatya se thik 13 din pehle yani 25 may 2016 ko gangster saleem ek maamle kii peshi ke liye tihaad jail se kanpur court main laayaa gaya tha
 At the rest room of the railway station, he along with his operatives planned to remove Zaid from the road
 is kaam ke liye usne farhaan ko jaid se dosti gahari karne ke liye kaha or saath hi do sharp shooter is kaam ke liye chune
 In which Salim's special shooter Ravi Gautam was also included
 teen shooter is kaam ke liye lakhanu bheje gaye the
 After arresting 5 people involved in the conspiracy, police arrested a total of five people in this case on his spot
 lekin katl ko anjaam dene vaale shooter ravi gautam or uske saathiyon ko aaj bhi police talash kar rahi he
 Another case was filed against Salim in this case
 rashtrawaad ke saath sabase badi khubi yah he ki koi bhi bina jane ise jaanane kaa daawa kar saktaa he
 Nobody knew about it before the 19th century, but in the last 200 years, the form of nation and nationalism started emerging
 in 200 saalon main rashtrawaad ke naam par fasiwad bhi aayaa jab lakhon logon ko gas chembar main daal kar maar diya gaya
 In our own country, there was also an emergency during the chanting of the name of nationalism and monopolism in many countries of the world which is called Totalitarian State in English
 jisamen aap wo nahin karte jo rajya or uske mukhiya ko pasand nahin
 The party that is in power, it makes your eyes ache on the strength of the police
 meri raay main raajnneetik dalon ke paas rashtrawaad kii antim paribhaasha nahin hoti he na honi chahie
 i said that political parties have the ultimate definition of nationalism when they intend to abolish democracy
 kya kabhi aapane dekha he ki raajnneetik dal ke kaaryakarta kisi niti, ghatana or ghotaale ke vakt apane hi dal ke khilaaf naare laga rahe hon ki unke liye dal nahin desh mahatvapurn he
 If this had happened, before the BJP, Congress workers would have come on the streets against the 2G scam
 aisa hota to bijepi ke kaaryakarta, netaa vyapam ghotaale par party se istipha de dete
 When the country was eating 200 rupees a pulse, they would protest against their own government

 Leave the condemnation blasphemous isliye dalon kii raajnneeti dalon ke hit ke liye hoti he
 You will find history of violence in the government of every political party
 aap har ghatana ko rashtrawaad ke chashme se nahin dekh sakate
 If the riots did not take place in the government of which party and which party has not been named, would you call them traitors or anti-nationals
 main yah nahin kah rahaa he ki raajnneetik dal ke log deshbhakt nahin hote
 Exactly
 har dal apni soch ke hisaab se desh ko sajaane sanvaare kii kalpana karata he
 But when attempting to define nationalism in the name of religion, race, color, language and even tax, it is not intended to be nationalism
 uskaa iraadaa kuch or hota he
 To make our monopoly work in the name of nationalism
 har daleel ko chup kara dena
 Where the party and the leader walk
 baaki sab uske ishaare par chalate hai
 Why have the slogans of India breaking and ruining India not yet identified in JNU
 kyon sutron ke hawaale se khabaren aa rahi hai
 Everyone has opposed them
 jeenyu ke tamaam chaatro or shikshakon ne bhi
 Their protest is against the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar against whom no evidence of treason has been found so far
 dilli police kahati he ki ab agar wo zamaanat ke liye applai karegaa to virodh nahin karenge
 He is a young man, he may be given a second chance
 is hriday parivartan se pehle gali gali main raily kar jeenyu ko badnaam kiya gaya ki vahaan rashtravirohi tatv padhate hai
 What happened in Patiala House Court on the second day as well
 kya koi bheed haath main tirangaa lekar khadi ho jaaegi to wo hamase aapse zyaada deshbhakt ho jaaegi
 Will people be scared with the tricolor and be denied the right to justice? supreme court kii naaraazgi ke baad bhi duusare din kanhaiya kumaar ke saath marpet kii koshish hui
 The lawyers who were allowed by the Supreme Court to go inside the court said that they were abused
 bhay kaa maahaul he
 The Supreme Court intervened and halted the hearing and vacated the court room
 kanhaiya kumaar ko 14 dinon kii nyaayik hiraasat main bhej diya gaya
 The lawyers of Tis Hazari Court have said that if any lawyer is arrested in the Patiala court case, then Delhi Police will be opposed
 dilli ke tamaam baar sangh hadtaal par jane kaa vichaar kar rahe hai
 There was no hearing, the verdict did not come but channels and lawyers and organizations declared terrorist
 agar aisi hi bheed aapako uthaa le jaae or haath main tirangaa lekar ghoshit kar de ki aatankwaadi hai or maar de to aap insaaf ke liye kahaan jaaenge
 All this has happened in history
 rashtravirohi bataakar raajnneetik virodhiyon kii hatyaein hui hai
 Six million Jews were burnt in a gas furnace in Germany
 ye rashtrawaad ke apane khatare hai
 These dangers should always be talked about when and when people are busy in appreciating the merits of nationalism
 kolkata kii jadhavpur university main bhi kuch chaatro ne azaadi ke naare lagaae or afzal guru kaa samarthan kiya
 They are being described as Radical Group
 ek chaatr ne safai di ki hamane abhivyakti kii azaadi ke sandarbh main azaadi kaa naaraa lagaaya to ek chaatra ne kaha ki usne kashmir kii azaadi or afzal guru ke liye naare lagaae hai
 How can my slogans be anti-national because BJP has formed a government by joining PDP and Afzal Guru is a martyr for PDP
 kai chaatro ne aisi soch kaa virodh kiya he or tamaam sanghathanon ne ninda kii he
 The VC of Jadhavpur University has said that the people who raised slogans were not students of the university, there were anti-social elements from outside
 vaais chancelar ne kaha he ki asamaajik tatwon kii harakat kii vajah se chaatro ke loktantric adhikaar ko nahin chhinana chahie
 There is a different understanding of treason on the page of the law and different in the minds of the public
 itihaas kii kitabon main rashtrawaad ko lekar anant vyakhyaayein hai
 First, there is a difference of miles between both nationalism and patriotism
 ek jatil masale kaa agar ham baat-baat main raajnneetik istamaal karenge to aap darshakon ko rashtravaadi hone se pehle itihaas kii das bees kitaaben pard leni chahie
 Tagore, who wrote the national anthem, called nationalism a unity policy of dragon snakes
 is tarah ke udaahranon se bhi hamaari samaj saaf nahin hoti he
 But nationalism has also been called the refuge of high spirits and people have also made supreme sacrifices for nationalism

 You will only get this quality in JNU
 meri taraf se do guzarish he
 One, that if it can be open class, then it should be in Hindi and second, in this, professors associated with the RSS should also be called to give lectures on nationalism
 rashtrawaad 19veen sadi kii sabase taqatvar vichaardhaara rahi he jisane ham insaanon ko hameshaa hameshaa ke liye badal diya
 One nation, one language, one culture and one kind of thinking crushed all the diversities, but somewhere these variations kept fighting against this ideology and kept themselves safe
 kai log kehete hai ki siachin main jaan dene vaale sainik ko kya yah chhot he ki wo afjal guru ke liye naare lagaae
 But did not the kurtas of soldiers demanding One Rank One Pension were torn off at Jantar Mantar in this country

 The soldiers are worried, so why are the soldiers sitting at Jantar Mantar even after months

 Some asked why JNU moved with taxpayer money
 is tarah kii betuki daleel dene vaale yah bhi kehete hai ki iaiti, ames or im ke chaatr tex peyar ke paise par padhate hai or desh seva chhod videsh naukari karne chale jate hai
 Why tax nationalism did not raise the voice of why millions of crores of rupees loans of banks and industries are being waived and why poor farmers are not
 zaahir he tex rashtrawaad kii daleel garib virdohi he
 Swaminathan S
 Anklesaria Iyer has written an article in The Economic Times today
 lekh kaa unvaan he ki rashtrawaad virdohi mahaz ek gaali he, ek mukt samaaj main isaki koi jagah nahin
 He has given an example
 1933 kaa saal tha jab oxford uniwarsity ke chaatr sangh main is baat par bahes hui ki yah sadan kisi bhi paristhiti main raja yaa desh ke liye nahin ladega
 The proposal passed and there was a panic across Britain
 chaatro kii jamkar aalochana hui lekin kisi ko deshadroh ke maamle main giraftaar nahin kiya gaya
 The Scottish National Party wants to secede from Britain
 apana scottish raashtra bananaa chaahati he to kya unke netaaon ko deshadroh ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya jaae
 This has not happened
 ayyar ne is tarah ke kai udhaaharan diye hai
 The comments duniya ke nakshe main raashtra ke banane kii prakriya abhi bhi mukammal nahin hui he
 Somewhere nations are being destroyed, and elsewhere they are disintegrating
 har saal kahin nayaa jhanda banataa he to kahin purana gaayab ho ja rahaa he
 After the JNU incident, the BJP and the Sangh were able to convey to the people that anti-national slogans would not be tolerated
 jo bharat ko todane kii baat karegaa use goli maar dene kii baat tak kahi gai
 Law courts have no consideration
 rashtrawaad kanoon haath main lene kaa license nahin he
 In Assam itself, the Bodos have been demanding a separate state, but the Congress contested together with one of their factions
 isi desh main agal khalistaan kii maang ko lekar koon kharaba ho chukaa he

 Did not attend the party
 pidipi kii afzal guru ke bare main kya raay he koun nahin jaanata
 Who did not know who formed the government with them
 dikkat ye he ki jab itihaas padhane kii baari aati he to aap or ham itihaas kaa mazaaq udaate hai
 Then when politics has to be done, then it begins to explain the mystery of history
 maujuuda samay main rashtrawaad kaa raajnneetik istemaal rashtrawaad kii koi nai samaj paidaa kar rahaa he yaa jo pehle kai baar ho chukaa he usee kaa betuka sanskaran he
 This is a dangerous trend or people are able to deal with such threats
 satta par jis party kaa kabza hota he wo police ke dam par aapke naak main dam kar detii he
 In my opinion, political parties do not have or should not have the ultimate definition of nationalism
 maine kaha ki raajnneetik dalon ke paas rashtrawaad kii antim paribhaasha tab hoti he jab unka iraadaa loktantr ko khatm kar dena hota he
 Have you ever noticed that political party workers are shouting slogans against their own party during any policy, event and scam that the country is important for them and not the party
 aisa hota to bijepi se pehle congress ke kaaryakarta 2ji ghotaale ke khilaaf sadakon par aa gaye hote

 i am not saying that political party people are not patriots
 bilkul hote hai
 Each party imagines a decoration to decorate the country according to their thinking
 lekin jab dharm, nasl, rang, bhashaa or yahaan tak ki tex ke naam par rashtrawaad ko paribhaashit karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he to uskaa iraadaa rashtrawaad nahin hota
 He intends something else

 Silence every argument

 All the others follow his directions
 jeenyu main bharat ko todane or barbaadi ke naare lagane waalon kii abhi tak pahchaan kyon nahin hui he

 sabhi ne inkaa virodh kiya he
 All the students and teachers of JNU too
 unka virodh kanhaiya kumaar kii giraftaar ko lekar he jiske khilaaf abhi tak deshadroh ke koi saboot nahin mili hai
 Delhi Police says that now if they apply for surety, they will not protest
 wo noujvaan he, use doosraa mauka diya ja saktaa he
 Prior to this change of heart, JNU was ransacked in the street alleging that anti-national elements study there
 patiala house court main duusare din bhi jo hua wo kya he
 Will any crowd stand with the tricolor in their hands, then it will become more patriotic than us
 kya ab tirangaa lekar logon ko daraaya jayega or insaaf ke haq se vanchit kiya jayega
 Despite the resentment of the Supreme Court, Kanhaiya Kumar was assaulted on the second day
 supreme court ne jin vakeelon ko court ke bheetar jane kii anumati di thi unhone bataaya ki gaaliyaan di gai hai
 There is an atmosphere of fear
 supreme court ne hastkshep kar sunwaayee roak di or court room ko khaali karaayaa
 Kanhaiya Kumar was sent to judicial custody for 14 days
 tees hazari court ke vakeelon ne kaha he ki patiala court maamle main yadi kisi vakil ko giraftaar kiya gaya to dilli police kaa virodh kiya jayega
 All the associations of Delhi are considering going on strike
 sunwaayee hui nahin, faisla aayaa nahin lekin channelon or vakeelon or sanghathanon ne aatankwaadi ghoshit kar diya
 If such a crowd picks you up and declares that there are terrorists and kills you with a tricolor in your hand, then where will you go for justice
 itihaas main yah sab hua he
 There have been murders of political opponents, calling them anti-national
 germany main saath lakh yahudiyon ko gas kii bhatti main jhonk diya gaya
 These are their risks of nationalism

 At Kolkata's Jadhavpur University, some students raised slogans of independence and supported Afzal Guru
 inhen radical group kaa bataaya ja rahaa he
 One student clarified that we raised the slogan of freedom in the context of freedom of expression, one student said that he has raised slogans for the freedom of Kashmir and Afzal Guru
 mere naare rashtravirohi kaise ho sakate hai kyonki bijepi ne to pidipi se milakar sarkaar banaai he or pidipi ke liye afzal guru shahid he
 Many students have opposed such thinking and many organizations have condemned it

 There are infinite explanations for nationalism in the history books
 awwal to rashtrawaad or deshbhakti donon main hi milon kaa antar he
 If we use political talk in a complex matter, then you audience should read ten or twenty books of history before becoming nationalist
 raashtragan likhane vaale tagaur ne rashtrawaad ko ajgar saapon kii ekta niti kaha tha
 Even by such examples our understanding is not clear
 magar rashtrawaad ko uchakkon kii sharansthali bhi kaha gaya he or rashtrawaad ke liye logon ne sarvocch balidaan bhi diye hai
 The professors at JNU have decided to hold a public class on nationalism for the next one week
 paanch baje se ye class lagegi
 On Wednesday, Professor Gopal Guru took the first class among thousands of students
 topic tha raashtra kya he
 After this, Professor G
 Arunima, Tanika Sarkar, Nivedita Menon, Ayesha Kidwai, Achin Vinayak will lecture on nationalism
 ye khubi aapako sirf jeenyu main milegi
 i have two requests
 ek ki yah open class ho sake to hindi main bhi ho or doosraa isamen aresas se jude prophessoron ko bhi rashtrawaad par lacture dene ke liye bulaayaa jaae
 Nationalism has been the most powerful ideology of the 19th century that changed us humans forever
 ek raashtra ek bhashaa ek samskruti jaisi soch ne tamaam tarah kii vividhtaon ko kuchal diya to kahin in vividhtaon ne is vichaardhaara ke khilaaf sangharsh karte hue khud ko bachaae bhi rakhaa
 Many people say that the soldier who gives life in Siachen, is it allowed to shout slogans for Afzal Guru
 lekin kya isi desh main jantar mantar par van rank van pension kii maang kar rahe sainikon ke kurte nahin phaade gaye
 The medals were not drawn
 sainikon kii chintaa he to jantar mantar par sainik maheenon baad bhi kyon baithe hai
 Are they traitors? kuch ne kaha ki taxpere ke paise se jeenyu kyon chale
 Such absurd arguments also say that students of iits, AIIMS and iims study on tax payer's money and leave the country service and go to work abroad
 tex rashtrawaad ne kyon nahin awaz uthaai ki bank or udyongon ke lakhon karod rupee ke karj kyon maaf ho rahe hai or garib kisaanon ke kyon nahin
 Obviously, the argument of tax nationalism is anti-poor
 iconomik times main aaj swaminathan es ankalesaria ayyar ne ek lekh likhaa he

 The students were severely criticized but no one was arrested in the sedition case
 scottish neshnal party britain se alag hona chaahati he
 If they want to build their Scottish nation, should their leaders be arrested for treason
 aisa to hua nahin
 Iyer has given many such examples
 tippaniyan The process of the formation of a nation in the world map has not yet been completed

 Whoever spoke of breaking India was even asked to shoot
 kanoon adaalat kaa koi lihaaz nahin
 Nationalism is not a license to take up law
 assam main hi bodo alag rajya kii maang karte rahe hai lekin unke ek gut ke saath congress ne milakar chunaav ladaa tha
 In this country, there has been bloodshed about the demand for Khalistan
 kya ram jethmalani ne indira gandhi kii hatya se jude logon kaa mukadmaa nahin ladaa tha
 Did BJP not make Jethmalani a member of Rajya Sabha? party main shaamil nahin kiya
 Who does not know what the PDP is about Afzal Guru
 unke saath kisne sarkaar banaai koun nahin jaanata
 The problem is that when it comes to reading history, you and we make fun of history
 phir jab raajnneeti kerani hoti he to itihaas kii anaap shanaap vyakhyaayein karne lagate hai
 Currently, the political use of nationalism is creating a new understanding of nationalism, or an absurd version of what has happened many times before
