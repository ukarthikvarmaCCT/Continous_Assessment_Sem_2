loksabhaa main bijepi ko bahumat mila or gathbandhan ko baari nuksaan hua
 This was not the first time that the mood of the voters of Karnataka changed in a very short time
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhi aisa hi hua tha jab congress ko 122 siten, bijepi ko 40, jedies ko 40 or anya ko 22 siten mili thim
 But in 2014 Lok Sabha elections after assembly, BJP got 18 Lok Sabha seats out of 28, while Congress had to satisfy 9 and JDS 2 seats
 vidhansabha main bijepi ke paas maatr 40 siten thim, lekin loksabhaa chunaav nateezon ko vidhansabha ke lihaaj se dekhen to bijepi ko 132 siton par badhat hasil thi
 While the Congress was reduced to 78 and JDS 14
 matadaataaon kaa asthir mizaaj tab bhi dekhne ko mila jab loksabhaa ke baad haal hi main nikaay chunaav hue or congress ne baari jeet hasil kii
 Different election results show that voters in Karnataka keep their priorities in local elections, assembly elections and Lok Sabha elections
 pichley loksabhaa ke hisaab se dekhen to bijepi 171 siton par aage dikh rahi he, lekin sawaal he ki agar aaj kii taarikh main chunaav hon to kya bijepi kii yah badhat barkaraar rah paaegi?bijepi ke liye loksabhaa kaa pradarshan doharaana mushkilcenter for deveopment studies (CSDS) ke diarector sanjay kumaar kaa maananaa he ki yadi aaj sarkaar girane kii haalat main karnataka main phir se chunaav hon to ho bijepi loksabhaa kaa pradarshan nahin doharaa paaegi
 He says, 'karnataka voters vote in different elections with different priorities
 2013 main ve rajya main congress ko chaahate the lekin 2014 main loksabhaa main unhone bijepi ko tavajjo di
 Congress and JDS got majority in 2018, but in 2019 BJP made a clean sweep
 iskaa sidhaa sa matlab he ki karnataka ke voter centre main bijepi ko chaahate the, lekin rajya main garabijepi sarkaar chaahate the
 "if elections are held in Karnataka today, it is very likely that BJP will remain in the main fight but it cannot repeat the performance of Lok Sabha
 kyonki rajya ke liye voter kii praathamiktaayen alag ho sakati hai
 But Congress and JDS may also have to bear the consequences of people's displeasure
 'exis maai india ke chif pradeep gupta kaa kahana he, 'logon ne loksabhaa main narendra modi ko chunaa, lekin paanch rajyon ke vidhansabhaon main duusari partiyon ko jitayaa
 In Karnataka, the pre-poll alliance of Congress and JDS will not work as these parties have been opposing parties of each other
 shaayad isi kaa nateeja he ki loksabhaa chunaav main matadaataaon ne siem kumaraswami ke puure parivaar ko haraa diya
 Kumaraswamy's father and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda and his son Nikhil Kumaraswamy suffered a crushing defeat in their stronghold
 'gupta kaa kahana he, 'loksabhaa main logon ne modi ko vot diya, isliye bijepi ko rajya main ekatarfa jeet mili
 But when it comes to assembly elections, the BJP will have to bring a strong and popular face, because there is a difference between Yeddyurappa and Narendra Modi
 ' BJP president Amit Shah strongly condemned the previous UPA government, saying that the UPA government had three centers of power - the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and his son Rahul Gandhi, which led to the chaos
 amit shahne surat main bijepi kaaryakartaaon kii ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'desh main nitigat jadta kii sthiti ho gai thi
 Not a single decision was taken
 yah kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki sarkaar chal kahaan se rahi he
 
 
 It was either running from Soniaji's house or from the Prime Minister's house or from Rahul Baba's house
 
 
 'amit shah kaa yah aakraamak rukhpradhanmantri narendra modi ke us saakshaatkaar ke baad aayaa, jisamen unhone kaha tha ki sonia gandhi ek asanvaidhanik shakti thim, jo upie shashan ke dauraan piemo par vaastavik shakti kaa istemaal kar rahi thim
 Apart from this, Amit Shah also strongly attacked former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh

 Our project was all these programs since 1995, which we will bring again
 congress ne khud kaa ghar yojana ko 3 category main laanch kiya he

 b category main 1BHK flats ke liye 1,00,000 rupee bharne honge
 While for a 2BHK flat in c category, you have to deposit Rs 1,80,000
 congress ke is daanv se bijepi ke saath-saath gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi kii bhi neend ud gai he
 Modi says, 'some people distribute the paper and say that they will give home
 kaagaj kii naav lekar samundar paar nahin kiya jaataa
 There is a need to warn people in a manner
 congress ke is daanv kaa tod nikaalane main philhal bijepi jute gai he

 emsidi chunaav jaise-jaise najadik aa rahe he, raajnneetik partiyon kaa prachaar jor pakad rahaa he
 In this last round of campaigning, political parties are leading their star campaigners
 par filmi duniya kii chamak dhamak se nikal kar raajnneeti main utre ye sitare dilli ke emsidi chunaavo main zyada madadgaar sabit hote nahin dikh rahe
 The magic of Raj Babbar, who came to campaign for Congress in Vijay Vihar, Delhi, also could not have a special effect on the people here
 saath hi janata ne unhen party publicity kaa ek stant bataaya he
 The people of Vijay Vihar Phase-2 clearly stated that their vote will not go to the face value of the stars, Vikas
 rithala vidhansabha kshetra main vijay vihaar ward ke log apane maujuuda parshad se itane khafa he ki unka bharosa sabhi partiyon se uth chukaa he
 Locals have been raising the issue of road repair, drains cleaning and drainage for the past several years
 par unki koi sunwaayee nahin ho rahi he
 In such a situation, Raj Babbar could not attract the people
 janata apni samasyaon kaa hal chaahati he or aisa parshad chaahati he, jo unke bich se niklaa ho or unki pareshaaniyon ko samaj sake
 Therefore, it is difficult to estimate how much the face value of the stars will benefit the parties
 ab college main admician lene ke baad aapaki life doosraa mode le legi
 If you are going to college for the first time after passing 12th, then you should take care of some things, from this you can become a favorite of your colleagues from college to teachers

 isse aapako college va campus ke bare main pataa chalegaa
 Identification and Timetable from Teachers Your second task is to identify with your teachers
 unhen pahachaanen or apane classes kaa timeteble yaad rakhen
 If you attend their classes continuously, then soon you will get to know the teacher and other students
 discshan karnaa bahut jaruriagar aap college main dost bananaa shuru kar rahe hai to sabase jaruri he ki unke saath discshan jarur shuru karen
 If this discussion will be on studies and other subjects, then it will increase your knowledge
 iske alaava aapas main communication hone se help kii bhaavana bhi badhegi
 Balance in society and education is often such that some students do not hesitate to join the college's cultural or sports societies
 vahiin kuch students ati utsaah main ek se zyada sosayadi jwine kar lete hai
 At this time it is necessary to create a balance between the two of you
 campus activity main hissaa jarur lenkolege main padhai ke saath-saath aapke vyaktitv kaa vikaas bhi hota he
 For this, your hobby and activity is beyond your speech and education
 aapke liye extra karikular activity bahut jaruri he
 So take part in the speech competition of college, from debate to fest
 isse hi aap sabake favorit banenge
 In college life, only focus on studies is important, friends studying in college are from different backgrounds
 unki apni ruchiyan hoti hai, is dauraan kai baar kuch dost duusari field main kariyar bana rahe hote hai
 But you should choose a career according to your ability and interest
 sabase pehle apni padhai puri karen, uske baad hi faisla len
 While intensifying the war of words, Narendra Modi on Monday termed Rahul Gandhi as a 'model' and said he had little knowledge of Gujarat, while the Congress vice-president retaliated, accusing him and BJP of adopting double standards on corruption
 And are supporting select industrialists
 'kaisaa namoona le ai congress'gujarat main naukariyon main bade paimaane par riktiyaan or rajya ke lokayukta santhaan ke bare main rahul ke bhaashanon main jhooth failaae jane ko lekar modi ne unka majaak udaaya
 Modi alleged that the Congress had so far sent over 100 emissaries to his hometown Vadnagar to find out if he had ever sold tea? Modi asked, 'if you want to relieve stress, then listen to Rahul's speech
 unke ganit ke anusaar, gujarat main 27 hajaar naukariyaan rikt hai
 When the total population of Gujarat is only six crore, how is this possible? What model has the Congress brought? "rahul Gandhi is oblivious about Gujarat" Modi, bjp's prime ministerial candidate, accused the Congress vice-president of being oblivious about Gujarat, "rahul said in his recent speech It was claimed that Gujarat does not have a Lokayukta
 lekin unhen yah pataa hona chahie ki gujarat main lokayukta he or uski pehali report vidhansabha ke patal par rakhi ja chuki he
 Rahulbhai, what will happen to India if you do not know that much? ”modi also accused Sonia
 Modi also accused Congress President Sonia Gandhi that she did injustice to Gujarat on the Narmada dam issue for her political gains
 
 modi ne gujarat main chunaav prachaar ke dauraan kaha, 'sonia daawa karti hai ki gujarat kii janata peyajal se vanchit he
 i want to tell you that during the Congress rule, water was sent to Saurashtra region by trains

 ab desh aarthik sudhaaron ke liye kitna taiyaar he isapar pradhanmantri ke bayaan se itar bhi ek satya he
 The GST was laid under the One Nation One Tax Policy at midnight in the special session of Parliament on 1 July 2017
 desh ke tex dhaanche main is badlaav ko itihaas main ab tak ke sabase bade aarthik sudhaar kii sangya di gai
 This economic reform would have transformed the entire country into an integrated market
 kaarobaari sugamawa ke liye rajyon ke bich hone vaala vyapaar bina kisi baadha ke kiya jaataa
 At the same time, the most important aspect in this reform was to increase the income from the central government's tax by making an important exercise to prevent tax evasion in business 
 lihaaja, kai varshon kii kavayad ke baad jiesti kaa ek aisa dhaancha khadaa kiya gaya jo apane uparyukt makasad ko puraa karne main safal ho jaataa
 But after the implementation of GST on July 1, all the big businessmen across the country were required to register their entire business under the new tax system
 jiesti ke tahat kisi bhi bade kaarobaari ko apane puure kaarobaar kaa byora niyamit taur par kendra sarkaar ko dena tha
 With this, the Central Government would have got 100 percent knowledge of the business activities happening in the country and the tax assessment work on the business could be saved from tax evasion
 vahiin tex ke sahi aankalan ke chalate kendra sarkaar kii kamai main hone vaale bade ijaphe se yah bhi ummid lagi thi ki is tex sudhaar kaa sabase bada phayda upabhokta ko pratyaksh or apratyaksh rup se miltaa
 First, GST would have created a quality product and service structure for the consumer in the country, so that the provision to provide even at cheaper rates was present in GST
 lekin gujarat chunaavon ke prachaar kaa kendra notebandi or jiesti bana
 The Congress claimed from the very beginning of the campaign that farmers, laborers and small businessmen were troubled by the demonetisation and this gave a big blow to the country's economy
 iske saath hi 1 july se lagu jiesti ko rajya main mudda banaate hue congress ne chote or madhyam kaarobaariyon ko rijhaane kii koshish kii
 This attempt of the Congress was also seen to be effective to some extent when businessmen in many industrial areas of Gujarat came out against it
 iske jawaab main vitt mantri arun jetali ne jiesti main un utpaadon par badi riyaayat kaa elaan jiesti council se kara liya jiskaa sidhaa taalluk gujarat ke kaarobaar se tha
 The GST Council announced a tax rate cut of 27 products on 7 October
 in utpaadon main surat ke kapadaa udyog ko raahat pahunchane or nylon or polister samet khakhra or namakeen jaise khaadya utpaadon ko raahat di gai jisase virodh kaa sur kamjor pad jaae
 At the same time, many stringent provisions to prevent tax evasion in GST, such as giving full details of regular business to the tax department, were lightened so that the opposition of the businessmen would be eliminated
 haalanki in katautee ke baavjood congress ko ummid thi ki jiesti lagu hone se pareshaan kaarobaari bijepi ko sabak sikhaane ke liye taiyaar rahenge
 Hence, GST was also called Gabbar Singh Tax
 lekin is tamge ne vitt mantri ko gujarat main party kii saakh bachaane ke liye jiesti se 'aarthik sudhaar' ko gaayab karne kaa daanv chalanaa padaa
 Despite the series draw, Australia captured the Ashes, scoring 774 runs during the innings, with Steve Smith making a brilliant comeback as England defeated Australia by 135 runs on Sunday, the fourth day of the fifth and final Test of the Ashes series played at the Koval ground
 is jeet ke baad england kii team paanch maichon kii ashes siries 2-2 se drow karaane main safal rahi
 Despite the series draw, Australia retained the Ashes
 australia ne pichhali baar ashes siries jiti thi, isliye yah ashes kangaaroon ke paas hi barkaraar rahegi
 The 30-year-old Steve Smith stepped into the ground amid 'hooting' this time in England, but after the last innings of the Ashes series, the Australian veteran was welcomed by the audience
 ravivaar ko australia kii team match ke chauthe din 399 ranon ke vishaal lakshya kaa peechha kar rahi thi, lekin smith mahaj 23 ran banaakar laut gaye
 This was the first time in the series that Smith could not touch a personal score of 50 runs
 BREAKING: Steve Smith is mortal

 He departs to a standing ovation
 What a player & what an extraordinary rehabilitation

 During this, he played innings of 144, 142, 92, 211, 92, 80 and 23 runs respectively
 smith ke ye 774 ran 1994 ke baad kisi test siries main sarvaadhik ran he
 Brian Lara scored 798 runs in the series against the West Indies 25 years ago
 
 
 
 But a big coincidence was seen that Sunil Gavaskar also scored 774 runs during the 1971 West Indies series
 fark itnaa he ki tab sunil gavaskar ne apni debyue siries main windies ke khilaaf joardaar ballebaaji karte hue 774 ran banaae the, jo aaj bhi paanch maichon kii debyue siries main sarvaadhik ranon kaa world record he

 isliye in teenon kii kavitaayen prabhavit karti hai jinamein manushya bane rahane kii buniyadi chetana or apil he
 There is also a consciousness of being a woman in the poems of Lubna Irfan and questionability from that perspective
 ek taraf vah kahati hai ki 'jo santulan dhaaran karti he main vah stri hum, vah jo baagh par baithti he main vah devi hum, main prayek stri hum, prayek stri main hum


 main aag hum mujhe koi jala nahin saktaa or duusari taraf puuchhati he “or jo chunata he satya, or ve prashn jo inase upajte hai, or jo ath main shuru hota he or iti main ant 
 
 jo chunata he wo swapn jise ham yaad rakhen or ve jinhen ham bhul jaaen”
 The truth found in these poems is a confrontation rather than a direct confession
 mridul haloi kii kavitaaon main vah parivesh he jo shahrati kaviyon main nahin dikhataa, mridul jab kehete hai “kehane ko or kya baaki he / manushya bhul jaataa he vahi jo yugo se kaha gaya he / or mere bhaavana ke andar itane saare log awaazahi karte hai / raat ke andhera kii tarah sannata mujhe gher letaa he"
 The poet is concerned about the ruthlessness of his surroundings, but in his mind he also wants to preserve the softness of the paddy plant and love is at the root of it all
 sudhanshu firdaus kii kavita mahatvakankshi he is kram main kavitaaon main purvavarti rachanakaaron se mili parampara samvaad bhi jisame keval sahmati nahi he
 Socioeconomic conditions come subtly into the poem
 koi nahin jaanata kahaan se aata he kalidas / koi nahin jaanata kahaan ko chalaa jaataa he kalidas / har kalidas ke jivan main aata he ek ujjain / jahaan pahunch vah rachataa he apana sarvshereshth / vahiin utarati hai parijaat-si sugandhit / swarna pankhudiyon-si chamakatin meghdoot kii panktiyaan / uske baad keval kinvadantiyaan janashrutiyaan
 
 
 The comments teenon hi kaviyon kii kavita main ek raajnneeti he lekin vah narebaaji kii nahin he, parivesh or samay saapeksh he jisame apane hone kaa bodh bhi he
 In the final session, Ashish Nandy says that the poet struggles with his self-determination the most
 or sabase acchhee kavitaayen aatmsangharsh se sambhav hoti hai kyonki yahaan sangharsh manushya bane rahane kaa he
 Hence the poems of these three affect which have the basic consciousness and appeal to remain human

 Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has made a scathing remark about the chilli powder attack
 buudhvaar ko sonipat pahunche kejariwal ne apane upar hue hamale ke liye samooche vipaksh ko nishane par liya or jaan se maarane kii sajeesh rachane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Chief Minister Kejriwal reached Thana Kala village in Sonipat on Wednesday
 yahaan patrakaron ke sawaalon kaa jawaab dete hue unhone kaha, 'pichley 2 saal main mere upar 4 baar hamale kiye gaye
 This is not a mild matter
 hamale apane aap nahin ho rahe, balki kisi ke aadesh par karaae ja rahe hai
 We have become an obstacle to his eyes
 ye log milakar mujhe maravaanaa chaahate hai
 These people are repeatedly attacking us
 'i've been attacked 4 times in 2 yrs
 It's not minor issue
 These attacks aren't taking place,they're being ordered

 com / vt4bw8jshg — ANI (@ANI) November 21, 2018 It is noteworthy that on Tuesday, a man named Anil Sharma poured chilli powder on Arvind Kejriwal just outside the Chief Minister's Chamber in the Secretariat
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki arvind kejariwal kii ankhon main bhi mirch powder gira
 Accused Anil Sharma, a resident of Delhi, was arrested and taken to IP Estate Police Station
 hamalaa kareeb dopaher kareeb 2 bajkar 10 minute par hua jis vakt arvind kejariwal lunch karne ja rahe the
 Kejriwal reached Sonepat on Wednesday
 yahaan unhone biguef ke jawan shahid narendra ke parivaar ko ek karod rupye kaa check diya
 The journalists then asked him questions about the chili powder attack
 is par mukhyamantri ne kaha ki partiyaan unhen maravaanaa chaahati hai lekin marate dam tak ve kaam karenge
 Kejriwal said
 'mere khun kaa aakhri kataraa bhi desh ke naam he
 Other parties and governments have been frightened by the development work of the Aam Aadmi Party
 idhar dilli main party ke varisht netaa or dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne aarope lagaaya ki mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ko dilli kii janata ke hit main kaam karne se rokane ke liye bijepi unki hatya karana chaahati he
 Sisodia on Tuesday cited the attack on Kejriwal by throwing chilli powder and said that the attacker is a BJP worker
 unhone kaha, 'kejariwal ko kaam karne se rokane ke sabhi hatkande naakaam rahane ke baad bijepi mukhyamantri kii hatya karana chaahati he
 Yesterday's incident is the result of this conspiracy
 'sisodiya ne mangalvaar ko hamale ke samay dilli sachivalay main bijepi ke ek netaa kii maujuudagi kii baat saamne aane par isaki bhi jaanch karaane kii maang kii
 He said that the attacker's Facebook page used profanity for Chief Minister Kejriwal
 uske fesabook pej par yah silsilaa pichley ek maheene se chal rahaa tha
 His page has photos of BJP leaders
 sisodiya ne kaha ki mukhyamantri par hamale ke maamle main uparajyapal (alji) kii ore se koi bayaan nahin aayaa
 He told that Home Minister Rajnath Singh called Kejriwal and said that you should lodge a complaint with the police
 unhone police kii jaanch ke tareeqe par bhi sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki jis tarah poochtacha kii ja rahi he, usase saafe he ki police kii ore se bijepi ke aalaa netaaon ke saath dosti nibhaai ja rahi he, kyonki puure ghatnakram ko dekhne se lagata he ki bijepi ke bade netaaon ko hamale kii jaankaree thi
 Sonia Gandhi, who came to her parliamentary constituency Rae Bareli on a two-day tour, made two inaugurations in the morning and evening
 donon hi jagahon par ek baat milti-julati thi
 That was the prayer before the inauguration
 shuruyaat dalmau vidhansabha kshetra ke nagar panchayat bhawan se hui
 Even before Sonia's arrival, Panditji was waiting for them with the contents of Puja Archana by applying vaccine
 mediakarmiyon ke camaron kii disha bhi usee ore thi, jisase sonia kaa puja-paath thik tareeke se kaid ho sake
 Sonia first sat in the puja with a pallu on her head as soon as the inauguration program was inaugurated
 panditji ne kaleva baandha, mantrocchar kiya or sonia ke haath main nariyal diya
 Sonia also broke the coconut with her right hand at once, took Gari's prasad, then went to inaugurate the panchayat building
 kuch aisa hi najaara shaam ko manaharu ilaake main ek sadak ke udghaatan main bhi dekhne ko mila
 There too Panditji was waiting with pooja material
 sonia ain or subah kii tarah puja karne ke baad udghaatan kiya
 It is important to note that earlier if the Amanagandhi family was seen to have faith in any religion in their Lok Sabha constituency, then it was seen in that tour with the program of other religions or religions, but in this two-day visit of Sonia, so far no one else The program is not there
 aakhir kyon chhavi badalane main jute hai congress or gandhi parivarloksabhaa chunaav main haar kii chaanbin ke liye antony kamity ne apni report main muslim samudaay ke prati congress ke jhukaav ko bhi haar kaa bada jimmedaar mana tha
 It was only after this that the churn within the Congress intensified that a change in image was needed
 digvijay or salmaan khurshid kii bottla cond kii bayaanbaji ho yaa phir manmohan singh kaa sansadhano par alpsankhyakon kaa pehla haq jataane vaala bayaan
 The Congress is now looking to change its image
 lagaataar ek ke baad ek sandeshkeral kii raajnneeti main ab takisai dharmase antony or oman chandi congress kaa cheharaa the, lekin hindu voton main bijepi ne paith badhaai
 So the Congress chose Ramesh Chennithala of Hinduism, the leader of the opposition
 haal main ghoshit apni 8 rajyasabha ummidavaaron main bhi party ne ek bhi muslim chehre ko jagah nahin di
 In contrast, tickets from Sitting MLC were also cut from UP and Maharashtra
 rahul gandhi bhi mandiron main dikhte hanvaise sonia se pehle rahul gandhi bhi kedarnath mandir or uske baad bhi tamaam mandiron main mattha tekte najar aae hai
 Congress leaders were clearly told to participate in every program of minorities, but do not forget to give full preference to the programs of majority
 is vajah se 2004 main satta main aane ke baad2014 main satta ganvaane ke duusare salis baar pehali baar sonia or rahul holi ke din congress offis aakar sabase milte or gulaal lagaate-lagavate najar aae
 The review report from Gujarat also had an effect, the internal review report from Gujarat said that the party was seen favoring a particular section on the Gujarat riots
 iskaa siyaasi nuksaan hua
 By the way, after Diwali, when Rahul Gandhi met with the journalists, his house was illuminated by the frills of Diwali
 puche jane par rahul ne kaha ki ji bilkul ye diwaali ke liye hi lagi he or main har saal lagavata hum
 However, Sonia's close friends say that it is not about religion
 gandhi parivaar sabhi dharmon ko baraabar sammaan detaa rahaa he or detaa rahegaa
 Why do you want to change the image carefully? In fact, the party wants to be accused of being a pro-muslim who needs to change
 aakhir bahusnkhyakon kii keemat par wo raajnneeti kaise kar sakati he
 She is taking special care that it will return to the same image of Congress in which she is seen walking with all religions, not leaning towards anyone
 lekin sawaal he ki kya congress soft hindutv kii ore ja rahi he
 That is why now the Congress and Gandhi family get ready to cash in on the opportunity to change the image slowly
 lekin, dhyaan rakhana hoga ki ye siyasat kii wo upjau jameen he
 a slight omission can make one's political land barren

 shivaratri par bhagwaan shiv-parvati kii shaadi hui thi isliye is parv ko bhagwaan kii vivaah varshganth ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Many types of stories about the marriage of Lord Shiva are prevalent in different religious texts
 manyata he ki bhagwaan shankar ne himalay ke mandakini kshetra ke triyuginarayan main mata parvati se vivaah kiya tha
 The proof of this is the flame of fire burning here, which has been burning continuously since Tretayug
 kehete hai ki bhagwaan shiv ne mata parvati se isi jyoti ke samaksh vivaah ke phere liye the
 'triyugi Narayan' is a holy place located in Rudraprayag, it is believed that it was the capital of 'himvat' when Lord Shiva married Mata Parvati in Satyuga
 is jagah par aaj bhi har saal desh bhar se log santan prapti ke liye ikattha hote hai or har saal sitambar maheene main baawan dwadashi ke din yahaan par meley kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 It is still ignited today that the marriage pavilion is ignorant that in order to appease Lord Shiva, Goddess Parvati did penance beyond the Triyuginarayana temple called Gauri Kund after which Lord Shiva married the mother in this temple
 kehete hai ki us havan kunda main aaj bhi vahi agni jal rahi he
 According to Hindu mythology, Parvataraja was the daughter of Himavat or Himavana
 parvati ke rup main sati kaa punarjanm hua tha
 Parvati won the mind of Shiva with hard meditation and meditation at Gaurikund, five kilometers away from Triyuginarayana
 jo shraddhalu triyuginarayan jate hai ve gaurikund ke darshan bhi karte hai
 Mythological texts state that Shiva proposed marriage to Parvati at Guptkashi, en route to Kedarnath
 iske baad un donon kaa vivaah triyuginarayan gaanv main mandakini son or ganga ke milan sthal par sampann hua
 It is also said that Triyuginarayan was the capital of Himavat
 yahaan shiv parvati ke vivaah main vishnu ne parvati ke bhai ke rup main sabhi ritiyon kaa paalan kiya tha jabaki brahma is vivaah main purohit bane the

 After Delhi captain Virender Sehwag suffered an eight-wicket defeat from Mumbai, their batsmen failed to understand the balls of Lesith Malinga, which led to a humiliating defeat
 maalinga ne 13 ran dekar paanch wicket liye jisase dilli kii team 95 ran par dher ho gayi
 Sehwag said, 'I also talked to my players about the bowling of Malinga in the team meeting and told how they can be played but they failed to understand that
 ’ apane ballebaajon ko maalinga ke kahar se bachaane ke liye sahvaag ne bich main unka ek over madan bhi khelaa jo unke anusaar ranneeti kaa hissaa tha
 He said, 'I have faced him before, while the rest of our batsmen were playing him for the first time
 kisi bhi naye ballebaaj ke liye maalinga kii yarker or dhimi gend kaa saamana karnaa aasaan nahin hota he or isliye main use adhik se adhik khelnaa chahta tha
 Sehwag also said that if his team had scored a score of 130 then it would have been challenging this pitch
 unhone kaha, ‘yadi hamane 120 yaa 130 kaa score bhi banaaya hota to uskaa bachaav karne kii koshish karte
 You cannot defend the target of 96 runs
 hamaare gendbaajon or kshetrarakshakon ne acha khel dikhaaya’dilli ke captain ne iske saath hi sweekaar kiya ki team ko ek vishwastareey spinner kii kami khal gata he ki rahi he
 He said, 'yes i think we do not have a world-class spinner but hopefully Rilof van der Merwe will make up for it in the coming matches and our Indian spinners will also do a better job
 ’sahvaag ne yah baat maanane se inkaar kar diya ki unke madhyakram main anbhavi ballebaajon kii kami he
 He said, 'we have young and talented batsmen like Aaron Finch, Unmukt Chand, Naman Ojha
 twanti 20 main anubhav bahut adhik mahatv nahin rakhata
 When Sehwag was asked if the referral system should be introduced in Twenty20 leagues like the World Cup, he said, 'there is no time for this
 pehle hi ham par sahi samay par over puure karne kaa dabaav he
 Failure to do so will result in heavy fines, so i think IPL is fine without DRS
 isse khaas fark nahin padegaa

 At the All India Congress Committee meeting held at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi, Rahul Gandhi was made the official leader of the party's election campaign
 aawaaj main kuch adhik tevar ke saath unhone party kaaryakartaaon main utsaah bharne kii koshish kii
 The speech also had messages for bjp's Narendra Modi and Aam Aadmi Party's Arvind Kejriwal
 padhie is bhaashan kii das ahm baaten or unke raajnneetik myne
 1
 piem candidet ke culture par hi samvidhan kaa hawala dekar sawaal uthaa die
 This is interesting because there are many contenders in other parties and in such a situation it becomes their political need to declare the PM candidate
 jabaki congress ke manch se baar-baar lagaataar kaha ja rahaa he ki yah bataane kii jarurat nahin ki hamaara netaa koun he
 Was Nehru
 indira thim
 There was Rajiv, Sonia and now Rahul Gandhi
 2
 Targeting Narendra Modi's Congress Mukt Bharat slogan, Rahul Gandhi said that Congress is not a party
 is desh kii soch
 During this, he reminded that the Congress fought the British
 itnaa hi nahin rahul apane tark ko khinchakar desh ke 3000 saal ke itihaas tak le gaye
 He said that which is our thinking
 vahi gita-mahabharat kii soch thi, ashok kii soch thi, guru nanak kii soch thi, gandhi kii soch thi
 Now the issue is whether the people of the country will give this thinking of Rahul
 3
 Rahul Gandhi made the same popular demand in the speech
 pradhanmantri se desh ke liye 12 silendar maange
 It also said that inflation will reduce in Congress ruled states
 ye sunanaa mahatvapurn he
 Because of the inflation, the Congress lost badly in the assembly
 isi congressi manch par piem kah rahe hai ki mahangaai se kisaanon ko phayda pahunchaa he or congress ke purodha kuch or raag alaap rahe hai
 4
 rahul gandhi party main loktantr laane kii kavayad apane debyue ke dinon se hi kar rahe hai
 Under this, NSUI and Youth started elections in Congress
 ab kah rahe hai ki 15 sansadeey kshetron main payalat project ke tahat candidet kaa chunaav log karenge
 Officers and activists will vote and elect
 yah ek nayaa prayog he, magar congress ke liye
 The Aam Aadmi Party has already claimed such experiment
 5
 Rahul Gandhi accepted that the promotion of opposition parties at the time is better
 iske liye unhone shabd chunaa marketing kaa or kaha ki vipakshi dal (bijepi) ganje ko kangha bech rahe hai
 Then, targeting the Aam Aadmi Party, he said that new people have come, who are giving hair cuts to Ganj
 in par manmohan ne bhi nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 The BJP was called communal and taunted the Aam Aadmi Party and said that the country does not run through the streets
 6
 Rahul not only lured women with the help of cylinders
 unhone kuch aisa bhi kaha, jis par manch par baithi mummy sonia gandhi bhi khilakhilaa uthin
 Rahul said that i want half of the population in this room, in Parliament
 phir rahul gandhi bole ki main chahta hum ki congress shashan vaale rajyon main aadhi mukhyamantri mahila hon
 Now think about how revolutionary this idea is and how practical it is
 7
 Rahul Gandhi repeatedly mentioned the telecom revolution on the lines of some previous speeches
 vah yah bhi bole ki garibi rekha or middle class ke bich fanse logon ko ham aisi hi kranti kii tarj par middle class category main lekar aaenge
 Special emphasis on education
 magar sawaal uthta he ki pichley 10 saal main shiksha ke kshetra main krantikari badlaav kyon nahin kar paae rahul?8
 Taking a dig at the tendency to bow down to the government on the streets, Rahul said that he has the right to make laws, which the people have chosen
 maujuuda loktantr main bane nae dabaav samoohon ke ulat rahul kii yah baat congress kii soch ko bhi dikhaati he
 The message is clear that the public representatives will be considered as those who will win the election
 9
 In today's speech, Rahul Gandhi adopted the same technique used in campaigning for assembly elections
 congress party ne logon ko adhikaar diya he
 RTI is frequently mentioned
 masalaa ye he ki artiai se aam aadmi kaa sidhaa koi vaasta nahin or ye samasya kaa prabhavi or antim nistaaran bhi nahin karata
 Rahul also gave the credit of Lokpal to the Congress completely
 bada sawaal yah he ki congress jis bhrashtachar ko mudda bana rahi he, kahin vah buumarang na kar jaae
 10
 aap congress samarthak hon yaa virdohi
 One thing remained in today's speech
 rahul gandhi or dinon ke bajaay urja se labarej najar aae

 After the results of the UP civic elections, the poll of Shabana, a councilor candidate from Saharanpur who questioned EVM, has been revealed
 usne aarope lagaaya tha ki use ek bhi vot nahin mila he
 Questions arose on where his and his family's vote went? When Shabana and her husband Ikram raised this question in the media, then this statement became viral on social media
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne bhi is bayaan ko apane twitor handle se retweet kar hawa de di
 However, it is now clear that Shabana was lying
 sach to yah he ki saharanpur jile se ward number-54 par parshad ke pad par chunaav lard rahi shabana ko jiro vot nahin, balki 87 vot mili hai
 The entire figure is recorded in the Uttar Pradesh Election Commission website
 nagar nikaay chunaav ke nattejey aane par shabana ne iviem par sawaal uthaate hue kaha tha, ''ye kaise sambhav he ki meraa vot bhi mujhe nahin mila
 At least i and my family should have got votes
 '' isse pehle bhi kai baar iviem par sawaal uthte rahe hai
 In Saharanpur ward councilor from Shabanko, ward number 54, it was revealed that he did not get a single vote on booth numbers 387 and 388
 is par shabana ne iviem kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaae
 He said that at least he has got votes for himself and his family
 shabana ne kaha ki aakhir aisa kaise ho saktaa he ki unka apana hi vot unako na mila ho? unhone kaha ki hamen ummid thi ki kam se kam 900 vot milenge, lekin aisa nahin hua
 He had alleged that there was a disturbance in the evms when he did not get a single vote at the booth
 isse pehle voting ke dauraan bhiiviemmen gadabadi kii shikaayatein ai thim

 From General Ayub Khan to all the leaders of Pakistan till now, there is a fear that India should not adopt this strategy in response to their ambitions to seize Kashmir by force

 Especially during the intervening night of 28–29 September, the adventurous surgical strikes by Indian troops across the Line of Control to destroy terrorist targets may have reinforced this feeling, forcing Islamabad to deny it
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad sabase kathin videsh niti sambandhi chunauti ke samaksh narendra modi ne aisi ranneeti apanaai, jise nirbhik, bahadurana or ukvada hi kaha ja saktaa he
 The move was fearless because the way Kashmir was getting out of India's control in July and Pakistan pushed India backwards, Modi took an aggressive stance at the same time
 unhone swatantraaa diwas par baluchistan main maanavadhikaar ulanghan kaa masalaa uthaa diya or phir china main samooh-20 kii baithak main duniya bhar ke netaaon ke saamne aatank ko badhaava dene ke liye pakistan ko aade haathon liya
 After this, India worked to isolate Pakistan on the international stage and turned water on the issue of Kashmir in the United Nations
 yah bahadurana isliye tha kyonki udi hamale ke baad bharat ne niyantran rekha ke paar sainya hamalon kaa vikalp apnaane main sankoch nahin bartaa, baavjood iske ki iske badaae kii paryaapt gunjaaish thi
 Experts may argue that this is not the first time India has launched such an attack, but rarely has it been so widespread (see report: counter-attack across the border)
 na hi kabhi aise hamalon kaa utana prachaar kiya gaya jaisaa ki endie kii sarkaar ne is baar kiya he taaki pakistan or vishwa ko ek kadaa sandesh jaae ki ''ab bahut ho chukaa
 "at the same time, domestic resentment can also be controlled, which is born after the Uri attack in which 19 soldiers were killed
 yah kadam umdaa isliye tha kyonki modi ne tab ek aisi ranneeti par kaam karnaa shuru kiya tha, jisamen theodor roosevelt ke is uddhran kii chhavi dikhaai detii thiah ''pyaar se bolo or lanbaa danda lekar chalo
 "the former president of the United States, describing his style of foreign policy, had said," This step is an example of excellent thinking and decisive action if done before any possible crisis
 "modi or unki team ne paryaapt doordarshita dikhaai or kadi karrwai kii, jab unhone kashmir main pakistan kii aakraamakata kii ek satark or sadhi hui pratikriya taiyaar kii
 He put all the pieces on the chessboard in the right places before attacking and then achieved the intended goal
 is dauraan modi pyaar se bolte rahe
 At the BJP national executive meeting in Kozhikode, Kerala, he opened his mouth for the first time after the Uri attack and while retaining the right to teach a lesson to the culprits of Uri, denying the possibility of war
 apane behtareen netritv kaa istemaal karte hue modi ne pakistan kii avam or aatank ko panaah dene vaale uske hukmaranon ke bich ek lakeer khinchate hue vahaan kii janata kaa aahvaan kiya ki vah ''garibi or berogari ke khilaaf jang main" unke saath aae
 After this Modi swung his long stick
 sanyukt raashtra main baluchistan kaa mudda uthaane ke liye videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ko bhejne ke baad modi ne 1960 kii sindhu nadi jal sandhi kii samiksha kii baat kii
 Instead of talking about canceling it, he expressed the possibility that India can use the river water as a weapon whenever it wants
 aisa laga ki unhone kosicode main jo kaha tha, yah usase ulat he kyonki pani ek aisa masalaa tha jo pakistan kii janata ko prabhavit kar saktaa tha
 "the Prime Minister has never said that if you misbehave he will not punish you," an official explains
 " unhone pakistan se bharat ke vyapaarik sambandh kii samiksha kii bhi baat kii, jisamen sabase pasandida desh kaa darja bhi shaamil tha
 After this, Modi canceled the SAARC conference in Islamabad to teach Nawaz Sharif a lesson
 iske baad bharat ne dakshes ke duusare sadasyon nepal, bangladesh, afghanistan or srilanka ko bhi yah elaan karne ke liye raji kar liya ki ve bhi usamen nahin ja rahe
 Its message was clear: Pakistan is not the problem of India alone, but the whole region has problems with it
 modi ne jab sena kaa istemaal karne kaa faisla kiya, to unhone aisa vikalp chunaa jisase jang bhadakne kii nunatam sambhaavna thi
 The first of the two options was to disband Pakistan on the lines of 1971 or to capture Pakistan occupied Kashmir
 inhen baahar rakhaa gaya kyonki inase ek parmaanu jang kii gunjaaish banati thi
 Another option was to eliminate terrorists like Hafiz Saeed by attacking with a missile, but it was too risky and could provoke Pakistan
 modi ne niyantran rekha ke paar sargical hamale kaa vikalp chunaa kyonki pehle bhi elosi ke aarpaar hamale ho chuke the or donon fujen isaki aadi thim, jisase baat aage nahin badhati thi
 After giving a strong message to Pakistan, Modi indicated to him that even though he has decisively changed the rules of dealing with Pakistan, he is still ready to normalize relations, provided he stops inciting India
 elosi paar hamale ke elaan ko kaaphi satarkta ke saath sadhe hue shabdon main kiya gaya taaki yah bataaya ja sake ki aatanki samoohon par kadaa hamalaa bolne ke baad ab bharat kii manshaa tanaav ko or badhaane kii nahin he
 The country stood firmly behind Modi, with even opposition parties supporting the attack
 jaisaa ki ek aalaa adhikari ne bataaya, ''hamane sanyam kii nahin, ranneetik udaseenta kii niti ko tyaagaa he
 We have sent a strong message in Pakistan that we are keeping our conditions in a strict and positive manner
 agar ve aage aate hai, to ham or zyada khulne ko taiyaar hai—sampark, sanchaar, yahaan tak ki ham unhen bijli bhi bech sakate hai
 If they think that they will be able to maintain the policy of terrorism, then it will have to pay the price
 "pakistan kii pratikriya kaaphi naram he
 Both the army and the government there have denied the attack, although Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is holding a series of cabinet meetings and the army chief's visit to the army's strike corps, clearly shows that the message has reached them
 pakistan kuch had tak jawaab degaa, khaskar isliye kyonki donon sharifon ke bich satta kaa takaraav he or fouj pramukh, jo ritair hone vaale hai, apana seva vistaar chaahate hai
 That is why the terrorist attack in Kashmir and the attack on Baramulla were expected last week, but according to experts, the real concern is about major attacks across the country, especially among the civilian population
 isse shuru main simit str par jang bhadak sakati he, jo bharat nibhaa le jayega lekin hameshaa yah khatra bana rahegaa ki kahin yah niyantran se baahar na chali jaae
 It is a different matter that the Pakistani army fighting the terrorists along the border of Afghanistan will find it difficult to open another front with India at this time and it will not want to do so
 china ko chhod den to antarrashtriya str par tamaam badi takaton ne bharat kaa majbootee se paksh liya he
 Beijing, however, is worried about rising tensions in the subcontinent and is likely to ask Pakistan to remain calm rather than support it
 sindhu ke pani or baluchistan kaa mudda uthaane ke alaava modi kii ranneeti ne ek kaam yah kiya he ki usne sirf kootnithik algaav yaa sainya hamalon se itar kai kism ke vikalpon ko sakriy karne kii jagah bana di he
 Going closer to Afghanistan, UAE, Iran and Saudi Arabia, India is actually encircling Pakistan like the Boa Python before the attack
 modi ne apni pratikriya main ek kism kii anischitata kaa tatv bhi samahit kiya he, jiske chalate pakistan lagaataar kayaas lagane ko majaboor hota rahegaa ki bharat kaa aglaa kadam kya hoga
 In addition Pakistan is denying the surgical attack
 lihaaja vah kathor sainya jawaab ke liye tark nahin juta sakegaa
 If he strikes a terrorist attack once again, it will strengthen India's side
 agar lakshya yahi tha, tab to bharat kaamyaab kaha jayega
 One adverse side of this is that from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, the whole of India is conscious about the terrorist attack round the clock
 pathankot or udi main jaisaa ki dekha gaya, apane surakshabalon kii nigaraanee karne main bharat kamjor he, isliye use paridhi par suraksha kadi karne ke liye taatkaalik upaay karne honge (dekhen reportru majboot dhaal)
 Kashmir is continuously boiling and there is no benefit from the increased tension with Pakistan
 isliye vahaan kii janata ko jeetne ke liye modi ko jald hi kuch saahasik kadam uthaane honge
 National security advisors of both countries talking on the phone is a reassuring sign that steps are being taken to de-stress the situation
 pradhanmantri ne yah dikhaa diya he ki pakistan ke maamle main ve ek faislakun netaa hai
 Now Modi will have to walk on the tight rope between softness and softness in relation to Pakistan
 bihar main rashtriya janata dal satta kii kursi par nitish kumaar kii jagah tejasvi yadav ko dekhnaa chaahati he, isliye upmukhyamantri tejasvi yadav ke mata pita rabari devi or party pramukh lalu yadav is aashay kaa bayaan har din de rahe hai
 In a new development, Lalu Yadav said on Friday that 'nitish ji and we are getting old, we will see how long we will last, only young people will see
 ' haalanki lalu ne iske pehle ye bhi kaha ki mahagathbandhan ke netaa nitish kumaar hai lekin bhavishya in logon kaa he
 These children are learning, working and people who are demanding to make Tejashwi as Chief Minister, there is a desire of those people
 isse pehle tejasvi kii maa or lalu yadav kii patni rabari devi ne guuruuvaar ko mahagathbandhan ke vidhayak dal kii baithak ke baad kaha tha ki janata tejasvi ko mukhyamantri dekhnaa chaahati he
 However, immediately after Rabri Devi's statement, the leaders of Janata Dal United and Congress had put an end to the whole issue by saying that people have freedom to speak but Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will remain
 lekin lalu yadav ke bayaan ke baad nishchit rup se in donon partiyon ke netaa na aashcharyachakit chakit the balki unka kahana tha ki lalu yadav ne bayaan dekar anayas vipaksh ko chutki lene kaa mauka de diya he or logon ke bich ye mahagathbandhan ke prati or bhram failaayegaa
 The comments janata dal united ke mukhya pravaktaa sanjay singh ne lalu yadav ke bayaan par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki koun boodha, koun jawan kursi par baithegaa ye janata tay karti he lekin jahaan tak nitish kumaar kaa sawaal he, is desh main kitne mukhyamantri hai jo saal ke 365 din bina brake ke kaam karte hai
 And Nitish Kumar is a quantity leader in whose name the public has given the mandate not once or thrice
 ye bhi sach he ki nitish kumaar ke netritv ke kaaran janata ne kai rajintik dalon ko arsh se farsh par laa diya vahiin kai dalon ko rajya kii raajnneeti main praasangik bhi kar diya
 But knowing that whether it is Rabri Devi's statement or Lalu Yadav's, targeting Nitish as he is claiming for his son will increase the alliance in the days to come
 haalanki rabari devi ke bayaan par turant janata dal united or congress ke neton ne ye kah kar puure mudde par viraam laga diya tha ki logon ko bolne kii swatantraaa he lekin mukhyamantri nitish kumaar hi rahenge
 But after the statement of Lalu Yadav, the leaders of these two parties were certainly not surprised, but they said that by giving a statement, Lalu Yadav has given a chance to pinch the opposition spontaneously and this will create more confusion among the people about the grand alliance
 
 tippaniyan Reacting to Lalu Yadav's statement, Janata Dal United Chief Spokesperson Sanjay Singh said that the people decide who old, who will sit on the chair, but as far as Nitish Kumar is concerned, how many Chief Ministers are there in this country for the year 365 days work without a break
 or nitish kumaar ek maatra netaa hai jinke naam par janata ne ek baar nahin teen baar janadesh diya he
 It is also true that due to the leadership of Nitish Kumar, the public brought many political parties to the floor with haste, while also making many parties relevant in the politics of the state
 lekin jaanakar maanate hai ki wo chaahe rabari devi kaa bayaan ho yaa lalu yadav kaa, nitish ko nishane par rakh kar jaise ye apane putr ke liye daavedaari kar rahe hai usase aane vaale dinon main gathbandhan main ganth or badhati jaaegi

 According to Swati Maliwal, LG is repeatedly imposing appointments in the Delhi Women's Commission, Swati Maliwal has sought immediate reforms by intervening with the President on this issue

 The southern Indian state of Telangana became the most talked about state in recent times when Chief Minister K
J
 chandrashekhar raav ne tay samay se aath maheene pehle hi vidhansabha ko bhang karne kaa elaan kar diya
 Although its signs started coming from August itself, but it was formally announced on 6 September
 raav samay purv chunaav ke liye puri tarah se taiyaar the or unhone vidhansabha bhang karne ke kuch samay baad hi 119 sadasyeey vidhansabha ke liye apni party ke 105 pratyaashiyon kii ghoshnaa bhi kar di
 The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is assuming that the favorable atmosphere in the state is better for the party and people are happy with the work of the state government
 tiares kaa akalan yah bhi tha ki yadi 2014 main loksabhaa chunaav ke saath hi vidhansabha ke chunaav bhi hue or us vakt rajya main modi kaa jaadu chal gaya to na sirf loksabhaa main balki vidhansabha chunaav main bhi bhaajapa kadi takkar dene kii sthiti main ho sakati he
 Therefore, he dissolved the assembly at a time so that assembly elections could not be held with Lok Sabha elections
 isi saal 4 rajyon main disambar main chunaav hone hai or tiares disambar main hi inhen rajyon ke saath telugana main chunaav chaahati he
 Since there is no tighter leadership than Rao in any other party in the state, the TRS people considered the decision to dissolve the Telangana Assembly elections unilaterally before the assembly was premature
 lekin achaanak hi is sateek soch par grahan laganaa shuru ho gaya
 The foundation of a strong coalition of opposition parties against Rao has fallen in the state
 padosi rajya andhra pradesh ke mukhyamantri chandrababu naidu aakhirkaar apni dhur-virdohi rahi congress ke saath gathjod karne main kaamyaab rahe
 There was not even a single dissent in the assembly that the tdp-congress and the Left Party gave a call to challenge the TRS under the alliance
 tidipi ke 35 saal ke itihaas main yah pehla mauka he jab party ne congress ke saath haath milaayaa he
 Congress state president Uttam Kumar Reddy has said, “the Grand Alliance has been formed to defeat TRS
 abhi kai or dal bhi hamaare gathbandhan kaa hissaa honge
 TRS sources say that in fact the party failed to anticipate that such an alliance would come out so soon
 tidipi, congress or left partiyaan ekasaath aakar dat gai hai isliye chunavi ranneeti main jald se jald badlaav karnaa hoga
 TRS says that the way Congress has joined hands with TDP, it is clear that the Congress has given up before the elections in the state
 chandrashekhar raav ke netritv par rajya kii janata ko bharosa he or ham kisi bhi gathbandhan se jeetne main sakasham hai
 However, despite these claims, the reality is that Congress and tdp's vote percentage is much higher than the TRS vote share
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaav main tiares ko 34
 3 per cent of the votes were received, while the Congress 25
 2 or tidipi ko 14
 7 percent votes were received
 arthath tiares ke vot share se 5
 6 percent more
 aise main ab tiares or unke khilaaf datane vaale tidipi-congress-left gathjod ke liye eiemiem mahatvapurn factor ban kar ubhara he
 Both the contestants will try to overcome this because Asaduddin Owaisi's party AIMIM is not in a position to directly challenge the TRS or the opposition coalition but is in a position to defeat both of them in multiple seats on the strength of its Muslim vote bank

 Chandrasekhar Rao is the first Chief Minister of Telangana state

 Rao, an ally of the BJP, was advocating for the Federal Front this time
 front banane ke liye unhone bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee ko sahyog dene kaa elaan bhi kiya
 He later stopped discussing it and gave a chance to speculate that he could become an ally of BJP after 2019

 In Andhra Pradesh (telangana and Andhra had no separate elections), Lok Sabha and Assembly elections were contested with the BJP but in Telangana, they could not stand with their ally BJP in front of TRS

 He immediately held talks with Congress after kcr's decision to dissolve the assembly
 chah dinon main unhone gathbandhan kar majboot chunauti pesh kar di he
 The importance of the Congress is the traditional vote bank of the Congress in Telangana and people have not yet forgotten that Sonia Gandhi had a major role in creating a separate state
 chunaav main congress ise mudda bana sakati he, jiskaa sidhaa phayda gathbandhan ko ho saktaa he
 But the support of TDP may harm him because Naidu's image is more of a Andhra proponent
 agar congress vidhansabha main achche nattejey nahin laa saki to iskaa asar loksabhaa chunaav kii uski sambhaavnaaon par bhi padegaa
 Asaduddin owaisiaimim chief Asaduddin Owaisi is the only Lok Sabha MP of his party from Telangana

 Telangana has a significant number of Muslim voters
 haalanki ovaisi kii party is sthiti main nahin he ki vah tiares yaa tidipi-congress or left gathbandhan kaa vikalp banakar ubhar sake lekin ve jis kheme main jaaenge, us kheme ko laabh mil saktaa he
 They have not opened their cards yet, but TRS is keen that Owaisi be brought into their ranks
 iske ulat tidipi bhi ovaisi ko apane paale main karne kii soch kar chal rahi he

 a few days ago, a survey by the Thomson Reuters Foundation was disputed
 is survey ko lekar desh main kuch virgon kii ore se tikhi pratikriya bhi jataai gai thi
 In this survey, an attempt was made to conclude that India is the most dangerous country in the world due to incidents of sexual harassment or rape
 abhi us survey par bavaal khatm bhi nahin hua he ki ab desh main soshal media par kuch log bharat main rape ke adhiktar maamalon ke liye ek samudaay vishesh ke logon ko kathghare main khadaa karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Some figures are trying to give a communal color to crime like rape which embarrasses humanity
 twitor par mahesh vikram hegade ko pradhanmantri narendra modi bhi follow karte hai
 Hegde is the co-founder of a website called Postcard News and has also been jailed in March 2018 in connection with Fake News

 It is also said that 96% of the victims in such cases were non-muslims
 aankadon ke saath daawa karne waalon ne ye bhi likhaa he ki desh main muslim samudaay ko utana khatra nahin jitna hinduon ko he
 Hegde's tweet is being spread on social media platforms

 Don't always assume that
 i just asked to share source so as to be reliable and be safe! Better if it is from the Home ministry data on crime available on their site
 - Sriniwaas Manur 🇮🇳 (@abodeoflakshmi) July 3, 2018 When the India Today viral test team called Hegde to get information on the data given in the tweet and also asked what is the source of these data, Hegde replied- 'these figures are correct but i will not tell the source
 ’viral test team ne jab rashtriya aparaadh records beuro kii website ko khangala to pataa chalaa ki vahaan 2016 tak ke hi aankade uplabdh hai
 When it was tried to see on the site of the bureau whether any crime statistics on the basis of religion are kept on his behalf, then it came to light that there are only figures available on these grounds in cases of rape
 pehla- peediton kii umr ke aadhaar par
 Secondly - were the accused already acquainted with the victims? The data of the victimized women is available on the basis of SC / ST but not on the basis of religion
 varayal test main yah jaahir hua he ki soshal media par kuch logon kii ore se managasaint aankade share kiye ja rahe hai, jo aadhikarik nahin hai
 Efforts are being made to give communal color by linking the heinous crime of rape with religion

 Perhaps this is the reason that the Kissima Security Force (BSF) did not distribute sweets to the Pakistani Rangers on the occasion of Diwali

 Punjab Frontier BSF Inspector General Ashok Kumar said that in view of the latest developments with Pakistan, this time India has decided not to offer sweets to Pakistan on the occasion of Diwali
 pakistan ne bhi id ke maukey par bharat ko mithai nahin di thi
 The Inspector General said that during the india-pakistan flag meeting on the Attari border on Wednesday evening, a message was given that this time India will not offer sweets
 unhone bataaya ki pakistan kii ore se elosi par kai baar sangharshaviram kaa ulanghan kiya gaya he, aisi sthiti main pakistan ko mithai bhent karne kaa sawaal hin paidaa nahin hota
 Both the neighboring countries have been offering sweets to each other on the occasion of festivals and Independence Day for years
 -input bhashaa se Singer Varun Bahar, who brought a storm on social media with this controversial song 'jo na bole jai shree ram, send him to the graveyard', has said that Ram is in his blood

 But he had no idea that the matter would go viral due to the song becoming so viral and he would start receiving threats from the country and abroad
 is kaaran unhen video main darj apane donon mobile number pichley teen dinon se band karne pade hai
 Varun said that he is in trouble
 unhen bahut dar lag rahaa he
 They regret it
 vah maanate hai ki unhen is tarah bhadakaau geet gaakar vivaad nahin khadaa karnaa chahie
 In a video released after the controversy over the song, Varun and songwriter Santosh Yadav appealed to the Bajrang Dal and the Hindu Yuva Vahini for help
 varun bahaar pehle bhi aise kai viral gane ga chuke hai
 Many songs such as '44 for 444' and DJ Yojana Modi Yogi's Sarkar - got a lot of views on youtube on the terror attack in Pulwama
 varun kaa kahana he ki isse utsahit hokar unhone kabristaan vaala geet gane kaa faisla kiya
 Aajtak in se phone par baatcheet ke dauraan varun ne khud ko upi ke gonda jile kaa nivasee bataaya
 He said that he had received a special education in music from Bhatkhande University in Lucknow

 in se kaha, 'sambandhit geet unke mitra santosh yadav ne likhaa he
 When he went to the studio of Lucknow-based music company 'janta Music', he replaced 'bade Do Pakistan' instead of 'bade Do Pakistan'
 varun kehete hai- gane main maine kisi jati, dharm yaa mulk kaa naam nahin liya he
 This does not raise the question of hurting anyone's feelings
 agar main kisi jati yaa dharm vishesh kaa zikr kar nishaanaa banaata to jarur doshi hota
 Nevertheless, all the people from the media followed us
 isse bhi bhadakaau or ashleel gane you-tub par bhare pade hai, koi un par sawaal kyon nahin karata
 'on the question that if someone does not speak Jayshreeram then why should he be sent to the cemetery? On this Varun Bahar says that the song was sung in Bhavavesh, now he realizes the mistake
 is maamle ko yaheen khatm kar dena chahie
 Even if hanged, i will say Jayashree Ram Udhar, after creating a ruckus on the song, Santosh Yadav (https: / / www
 youtube
 com / watch? v = yorghxrf4zi) has released a video with Varun
 jisamen santosh yadav kehete hai ki unhone gane main kisi samudaay kaa naam nahin liya he
 Then even if we were hanged for religion, we would keep saying Jayshreeram

 Shantakumar said, 'there was a thinking in our party that if we oppose this bill then our opposition can use it against us
 
 
 hamen pataa tha ki hamaari sarkaar aa rahi he
 
 
 If a government is formed, we will get it changed
 
 
 ' Now after the formation of a new government at the Center, in its report to the Prime Minister, the Shantakumar Committee has suggested some changes in the Food Security Bill, under which
 
 
 shantakumar ne media se kaha ki unke sujhaavon se sabsidi kaa phayda zaruuratmandon ko milegaa, bhrashtachar par kaabo hoga or licage kam hogi
 However, the recommendations of this committee are being criticized
 sawaal uth rahaa he ki cameti kaa kaam food corporation of india ko durast karne or uski karypranali main badlaav ke liye suzav dena tha yaa phir use food security bill ko lekar ye suzav dene kaa bhi adhikaar tha
 Committee member Ashok Gulati said that the committee has reviewed all the matters related to food and the food bill is a related matter
 udhar congress ne shantakumar cameti kii siforeeshon kii kadi ninda kii he
 Party spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said, "the bjp's Shantakumar Committee's Food Security Act to be reduced from 67 percent coverage to 40 percent is a vile conspiracy by Narendra Modi and BJP against the poor of the country
 
 
 garib ke pet par laat markar or uske munh se niwala chhinakar yah sarkaar yah sabit kar rahi he ki vah man or antahkaran se garib-virdohi or dhanapatiyon kii sarkaar he
 
 
 This shows the opportunistic and political dishonesty of the BJP by Shantakumar ji that the BJP was against 67 per cent coverage of this bill and had made up its mind to remain silent till the election
 
 
 ' Economist and professor at IIT Delhi, Ritika Khera, has opposed the recommendation of reducing coverage under the food security bill and cash transfer instead of food grains
 kheraa ne enditivi se kaha, 'kai rajyon main rashan vitaran pranali sudhar rahi he or licage kam ho rahaa he
 
 
 In this case, efforts should be made to strengthen the PDS system
 
 
 food security ke tahat logon kii kawarej kam karne se bhrashtachar kaise kam hoga
 
 
 ? kheraa ne in siforeeshon ko janvirohi bataate hue kaha, 'agar koyale main yaa 2-ji yaa 3-ji spectrum ke vitaran main bhrashtachar hota he or ham kahen ki in mantralayon ke bajet main katautee kar deni chahie to log kahenge ki ham murkh arthshaastri hai, lekin logon ko milane vaale adhikaar par katautee hoti he or uskaa bajet kam kiya jaataa he to koi uskaa virodh nahin karata
 
 
 ' shantakumar cameti ne buudhvaar ko pradhanmantri ko apni report di, jis par sarkaar ko faisla karnaa he
 If the government accepts these recommendations, then within a year, after the Land Acquisition Act, the new government will make changes in other major laws

 Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav has also adopted a village under the Sansad Adarsh gram Yojana, but the interesting fact is that the party which is tightening up on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and some other BJP mps for adopting villages without Muslim population In the village adopted by Nayak, more than 80 percent of the population has been fraternized with them, and there is no Muslim in this village too
 mulaayam singh yadav ne apane sansadeey kshetra azamgarh main based tamauli gaanv ko god liya he, jisamen 80 fisadi aabaadi yadavon kii hai, kuch log duusari pichhadi jatiyon ke bhi hai, or do ghar savarnon ke bhi, lekin puure gaanv main ek bhi musalmaan nahin basataa
 The funny thing is that recently Mulayam's warlord and UP Urban Development Minister Azam Khan had taunted Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of adopting a village without Muslim population, "when the emperor has a small heart, the country Where will it grow
 
 
 badshaah kii maansikta choti ho jaae, to desh kaise khushhaal rahegaa
 
 
 "so Azam Khan said this dialogue to Modi, but now look at the irony that it stuck on Mulayam Singh Yadav's adopted village
 tamauli gaanv nikatatam shahar se kareeb 10 kilometre dur he, or yahaan zyaadaatar log doodh kaa kaarobaar yaa kheti karte hai
 By the way, the people of the village have high hopes from Netaji, and Pradhan Ramlakhan Yadav says, "we want the way Netaji made Saifai make our village also
 
 
 " It is noteworthy that in Uttar Pradesh, most BJP mps including Prime Minister Narendra Modi have adopted villages where the Muslim population is negligible under this scheme
 uma bharti, calraj mishra, yogi adityanath, sanjeev baalion or yahaan tak kii party ke muslim chehre mukhtaar abbaas nakvi dwaara god liye gaanvon main muslim aabaadi nahin he
 In the adopted villages of Rajnath Singh and Varun Gandhi, the Muslim population is less than half per cent

 Do you keep tongue on your lips all day long? Perhaps you do not know, but this habit of yours makes your lips black and at the same time the lips of those who do this are also very quick
 par agar aap apni ungaliyon se lip-balm lagaati hai to bhi aapako saavdhaan ho jane kii jarurat he
 Usually we apply lip balm with fingers on the go, but it can be dangerous
 aise main ho sake to pehle apane haathon ko acchhee tarah saaf kar len or uske baad hi lip-balm lagaaein
 What do we do? Lip balm is commonly used for moisturizing
 hont jaraa sa sookhe nahin ki ham dibbi kholte hai, ungali andar daalate hai or balm nikaalkar hothon par mel lete hai
 But have you ever thought about how many infections it can cause? hamen to infections kaa khyaal tak nahin aata he
 But doing so is equivalent to inviting many diseases
 kyon he darana jaruri?hamaari ungaliyon par bimaariyaan failaane vaale kai bacteria or virus chipke hote hai
 They are so small that we are not even visible with naked eyes
 aap khud hi sochie aap toilet kaa handle, jet or flush yuj karte hai or uske turant baad usee haath se balm nikaalkar laga lete hai
 After which these bacteria enter the body through our mouth
 ye bhi ho saktaa he
 
 
 Our mobile sticks with our hands throughout the day
 lekin aapako shaayad ye pataa na ho ki hamaare mobile kii screen par ek toilet seat jitne bacteria chipke rahete hai
 Suddenly we feel that our lips are drying and we apply lip balm
 sochie, ek ungali se ye saare bacteria hamaare pet main pahunch jate hai
 What is the solution? If you also use lip balm applied with fingers, then there is still a chance to change it
 stick vaala lip balm yuj karnaa shuru kar dijie
 If you are not comfortable with sticky lip balm, wipe the fingers before applying the balm

 Katrina Kaif's film 'bar Bar Dekho', which has completed almost 13 years in the Hindi film industry, is about to be released, we have some special conversations with them, here are the excerpts
 film main aisa kya he jise 'baar baar dekh sakate hai' ?film kii kahani, kaaphi samay ke baad ek nayaa concept he or kahani he, jisebaar-baar dekha ja saktaahai
 What is new after all? Nowadays everyone is running so fast, whose relationship is deteriorating
 is film main unheen praathamiktaaon ko darshaya gaya he
 Problems between a boy and a girl are also shown
 film main aapkaa kirdaar kya karata he?meraa kirdaar 'diya' kaa he jo ek varking vuman he, dilli kii middle class ladki he, jiske liye parivaar zyada jaruri he
 For 'kala Chashma', you got a lot of compliments
 It is a great song, it shows the atmosphere of celebrations
 film ke liye bhi yah kaaphi jaruri song he kyonki hai energy vaala gaanaa he
 i enjoy such songs very much, i love to dance
 siddharth ke saath kaam karnaa acha rahaa
 Even physically i always maintain myself
 pehle aap senior actors ke saath kaam karti thi, is baar hamaumr actor hai, kuch alag rahaa?aamir, shahrukh,salmaan ke baad aditya or siddharthake saath kaam karnaa acha rahaa
 They are all good actors
 meraa bhagya he ki mujhe aise logon ke saath kaam karne kaa mauka mila
 There is a lot to learn with them
 kaisaa rahaa amitabh, akshay kumaar or baaki actors ke saath pichhali filmon main kaam karnaa?amitabh bachchan ke saath 'boom' main zyada seen nahin the, to unke saath zyada kaam karne kaa mauka nahin mila
 Aamir Khan remains very focused for work
 shahrukh kii dialog delivery kamaal kii he
 i have learned a lot from Akshay, he does a lot of work
 salamanabahut hi kshanik hai, jo sabake liye kaaphi rifreshing hai
 Those who do, do it from the heart
 dharma yani karan johar ke saath kaam karne main itnaa vakt kyon laga?pehle kai ophers aae the lekin kinhin kaarnon se main film nahin kar pai
 But this time we worked together
 apni jarney kaise dekhati hai?maine alag-alag tarah ke kirdaar kiye hai, 'namaste landan' main ek ladki kii kahani thi jisamen akshay kumaar ne aage aakar mujhe protsaahit kiya, uske baad 'raajnneeti' jaisi ahm film bhi kii, phir 'neuyork' kaa kirdaar bhi kaaphi mushkil tha
 In this way, there are different types of films in career
 maine balance karne kii hameshaa koshish kii he
 The most surprising fact to me during a visit to coca-cola's headquarters in Atlanta (georgia, USA) seven-eight years ago was that six of the fifteen-member global top management team of this global American veteran was Indian
 tab coca cola kii bharat main vaapasi ko dedh dashak hi beetaa tha or silicon vaili main bhartiya dakshata kii kathaayen bananaa shuru hi hui thim
 Subsequently, over the next decade, the Central Business District of every major city of the world started chirping at the presence of young Indian professionals as youth from ordinary families in remote areas of India also started making their place in big companies in the world
 bharat kii yah udaan us globaligeshan kaa hissaa he jis par america raashtrapati donald trump mandaraane lage hai
 Do not be surprised at the discussion of Trump in the budget post! The budget is spent
 kabhi-kabhi sarkaar kuch na kare to zyada behatar hota he
 The government did nothing in this budget, no policy adventureism
 notebandi ke ghaavon ko vakt ke saath bharne ke liye chhod diya gaya he
 So the major concern of the Indian economy is not a faded budget but a very aggressive US President who is going to be heavy, very heavy on India's successes
 pichley 25 saal ke aankade gavaah hai ki agar bharat global arthvyavastha se na judaa hota to shaayad vikaas dar chaar-paanch fisad se upar na nikalati
 Globalization accounts for about one-third of Indian growth
 bharat kii growth ke teen bade hisse antarrashtriya hai
 First: foreign investment in India, which has brought big companies, technology, innovation and employment
 doosaraah bharatvanshiyon ko global companiyon main rojgaar or soochna takanic niryaat
 Third: Foreign investors invest heavily in the Indian stock market
 donald trump in teenon ke liye hi khatra hai
 Foreign investment (diglobalization) 85% of global investment of world giants took place after 1990
 isamen nae sanyantron kii sthapana, nae bazaaron ko niryaat, mejabaan deshon kii companiyon kaa adhigrahan shaamil tha
 Emerging economies including India were host to this investment
 isliye 1995 ke baad se duniya ke niryaat main ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon kaa hissaa or china-bharat kaa videshi mudra bhandar badhata chalaa gaya
 This expansion of multinational investment and liberalization of India was in some way a sibling, so every big company in the world invested in the Indian market
 trump diglobaligeshan ke nae purodha hai
 After their threat, expansion plans and new investments of multinational companies operating in India are postponed
 america agar apana bazaar band karegaa to duniya ke anya desh bhi aisi hi pratikriya karenge
 Economies will take the path of protectionism and the policy of protectionism is like a war policy, as the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises believed
 sarkaar kii taaja aarthik samiksha bhi trade waar ke khatre kii ghanti baja rahi he
 Employment (protectionism) is the new middle class of India led by information technology
 computaron ne na keval jindagi badali balki nai peedi ko rojgaar bhi diya
 Concerns have deepened in thousands of middle-class families in India after the outpouring of outsourcing and new visa regulations
 america vija dobaaraa milanaa or vahaan naukari milanaa to mushkil he hi, vija rahane tak bharat aakar waapas america lautnaa bhi mushkil hone vaala he
 Information technology and pharma are India's biggest global breakthroughs, which not only brought foreign investment into India, but also brought a large amount of professional remittance to India, which is the basis of market demand
 agle do saal ke bheetar prashikshit magar bekaar logon kii jo bheed videsh se waapas lautegi uske liye naukariyaan kahaan hongi?majboot dollar (share bazaar)kamjor dollar or saste karj ne bharat ke share bazaar ko duniya bhar ke niveshkon kaa dulaara bana diya
 After 2000, the financial market of India was worth about a million rupees
 kaa videshi nivesh aayaa
 But with the advent of Trump, interest rates in the US started rising
 trump kii vyapaar va bajet nitiyaan dollar kii majbootee kii taraf ishaara karte hai jo rupye kii kamajori kii vajah banegaa or bharat ke vittiya nivesh par asar daalega
 This is the reason that this time the stock markets were more concerned about Trump's decisions than Modi's budget
 bharat ke liye jab aakraamak udaarikaran ke jariye globaligeshan ke bache-khuche maukey sametane kii jarurat thi tab vitt mantri ek rakshaatmak bajet lekar aae hai jo global chunautiyon ko peeth dikhaata lag rahaa he

 shaayad, isi ke chalate unke bich tikhi bahes hui

 The airline officials said that both the employees have been called to Delhi headquarters for questioning and they will be here on Thursday
 gauratlab he ki isse pehle 27 march ko air india ne apane payalton ko nirdesh jari kiya tha ki ve udaanon ke dauraan apane liye vishesh bhojan kaa order nahin den kyonki unhen company dwaara nirdhaarit bhojan suchi kaa anupaalan karne kii jarurat he
 It was decided that the pilots were found ordering special meals such as burgers and soups for themselves
 (input-bhashaa) On this occasion Mohan Bhagwat said that neither Sangh runs BJP nor BJP Sangh
 donon ek-duusare se salaah mashvira karte hai
 The meeting was organized by the India Foundation
 isamen bhagwat ne rajanyikon ke prashnon ke jawaab bhi die
 He tried to dispel misconceptions about the Sangh

 ' Thalasela chief General VK Singh has told the Supreme Court that the manner in which the government treated him reflected his complete lack of principles and procedure of natural justice in his age
 general singh ne apni janmatithi 10 may 1951 ke sthaan par 10 may 1950 nirdhaarit karne ke sarkaar ke faisle ko chunauti dete hue ucchtam nyaayalay main 68 prishthon kii yachika daayar kii he
 General Singh said that he had accepted his birth year 1950 in confidence at the behest of the then Army Chief
 unhone kaha ki iske peeche sainya sachiv kii shakha ke saath samjhauta nahin tha
 His petition stated that the defendant (government) needed to clarify why the senior most officer in the army was treated in a manner that reflected the complete lack of procedure and principle of natural justice, that too by the Attorney General
 Based on the opinion taken from
 general singh ne aashcharya vyakt kiya ki raksha mantralay ne sena kaa adhikarik ricard rakhane vaali adzutent general shakha ke recordon par andeh kiye jane kaa koi spashtakiran nahin diya
 He said that no other authority also did so, rejecting his plea
 unhone kaha ki yah samaj se pare he ki upiessi farm bhare jane ke dauraan asaavadhaaneevash hui galati ko kyon itnaa mahatv diya ja rahaa he jabaki anya ricard kii andekhi kii ja rahi he
 Accepting his date of birth, May 10, 1950, General Singh gave details of the conversation he had with the then Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor
 unhone kaha ki unhone general kapur dwaara aadesh die jane par aisa kiya
 General Singh said that in view of the high tradition of the Indian Army, he had no option but to follow the orders of his superior officer
 unhone kaha ki unke varisht adhikari ne aashwaasan diya tha ki vah tathyon ko sweekaar karte hue is mudde ko taarkik ant tak pahunchaaenge
 According to the petition, the army chief had personally assured him in 2008 that he would resolve the issue of birth date
 unhone kaha ki kareeb teen maheene tak is maamle main kuch nahin hua or unhone ek july 2008 ko tatkaaleen thalsena pramukh general kupar ko patr likhakar is maamle main nyaay kaa anurodh kiya
 General Singh said in the petition that the army chief had the right to take leave with dignity, although he admitted that the government had the right to fix his term
 general singh ne janmatithi 10 may 1951 sweekaar karne ke sambandh main apni sanvaidhanik shikaayat ko khaarij kar die jane ko ‘avaidh tathaa manamaana’ bataate hue kaha ki yah unke moulik adhikaron kaa bhi ulanghan he
 Seeking to reject this order, General Singh has argued that the government should be directed to consider his date of birth as May 10, 1951
 iske pehle raksha mantralay ne kaha tha ki 10 may 1950 ko aadhikarik janmatithi mana jayega or iske falswaroop vah isi saal 31 may ko avkashgrahan karenge
 After this, General Singh dragged the government to the Supreme Court
 unhone apni yachika main kaha ki unki umr se jude vivaad yaa is yachika kaa jo faisla ho, sarkaar ke paas thalsena pramukh kaa kaarykaal nirdhaarit karne kaa adhikaar he
 General Singh said that his refusal to accept his arguments regarding the date of birth and the government's move are affecting his image before the common people and the armed forces
 unhone yachika main daleel di ki sammanjanak jivan jeene kaa unka adhikaar he
 He said that the Army Chief has the right to take leave with dignity
 ’ mantralay ke 30 disambar ke aadesh or purv main unke maamle ko khaarij kiye jane kaa zikr karte hue thalsena pramukh ne kaha ki in adeshon main unke metric ke pramaan patr, seva ke ricard, padonnati or salanaa gopneey report aadi kii bhi andekhi kii gayi
 General Singh said that he received all the honors, promotions based on his date of birth on 10 May 1951
 unhone apni janmatithi 10 may 1951 hone ke samarthan main yachika ke saath kai dastavej or ricard bhi sanlagn kiye hai
 However, in his application, he has stated that in his application for admission to NDA, he had accidentally recorded the date of birth on 10 May 1950

 According to this report, the artificial lake on the Kanaka River is accumulating a very large amount of water and the water level in Kanaka and Teesta river is very fast due to the blockage on it
 5 meter se upar tak chadh jayega
 The CWC team has assessed the threat posed by this artificial lake on the Kanaka River and submitted its report to the Sikkim government, NDMA and NHPC

 The water level of the river at a distance of three kilometers in Kanaka river 4
 86 meter tak chadh jayega

 CWC has advised NHPC to release 1271 lakh cusecs of water from this Teesta-4 hydroelectric dam in a controlled manner in the event of a burst, but the unfathomable water from the artificial lake on the Kanaka river is in that situation
 Will become more dangerous when heavy rains are occurring in the catchments of Teesta River

 jahaan maujuuda pradhanmantri modi apane pita ke saath railway stesan par chaay bechakar parivaar chalaane main madad karte the vahiin paneerselvam bhi apane pita kii madad unki chaay kii dukaan par kaam karke karte the
 After selling tea at Modi railway station, he used to take time out and go to school and so did Paneerselvam
 paneerselvam ke pita party ke founder emji ramchandran ke liye kaam karte the
 During this time, he used to take time away from the tea shop and do the minor work of the party and party chief Ramachandran
 yah baat ramchandran ke bhi sangyaan main thi ki paneerselvam chaay kii dukaan par kaam karne ke saath-saath chennai ke ek college se grajuation kii padhai bhi kar rahe the
 Her proximity to Jayalalithaa was due to Sasikala and she took advantage of this opportunity to become very special after MGR in active politics
 sabase badi chunautirajya main maujuuda ediemke sarkaar kaa abhi chaar saal kaa kaarykaal bachaa he
 The biggest challenge of Panneerselvan during this four years is to keep the party united and keep himself at the center of the party
 yah baat vah jaanate hai ki beete chaar dashakon se ediemke pehle emji ramchandran or phir jayalalita ke karigma tale panpi he
 And currently he is the biggest leader of the party
 iske saath hi unki ahm chunauti rashtriya raajnneeti main us saakh ko barkaraar rakhane kii bhi he jiske liye pehle emji ramchandran or phir jayalalita jane jate hai
 In Jayalalithaa's era, the AIADM was a regional party, but in spite of that it always remained an unresolved puzzle for the Congress and the BJP
 rashtriya raajnneeti main vah jab or jaise chaahati gathbandhan main shaamil hoti or chhod deteen
 Has modi-shah's path become easier? AIADMK has been in the NDA for a long time, being in the BJP fold
 lekin pehle jaise atal-adwani ke liye jayalalita tedhin kheer sabit hui, thik vaise hi modi-shah bhi unhen saadhane main kabhi safal nahin hue
 Now Panneerselvam has been given the command of the state
 philhal unki chhavi mahaj jayalalita bhakt or party ko bakhubi chalaane vaale shaks ke taur par he
 It is also clear that he has never been able to create an independent image for himself other than Jayalalithaa
 unki yahi kamajori bijepi ke liye ediem ko saadhane kaa rasta aasaan kar sakati he

 shaayara bano ne vikrut paramparaon kii jakadaaa se personal lau kii mukti ke liye sarvocch adaalat main yachika daayar kii thi, taaki talaak-e-biddat (turant teen talaak) ko avaidh ghoshit kiya jaae
 No opponents objected to the triple talaq, but they objected to the politics being done in the name of 'muslim women's interests'
 unhone tark diya ki uske aarthik adhikaron kii raksha use vaivaahik sambandh se alag hone kii tulana main kahin adhik sakasham banaaegi, kyonki aisa sambandh sirf is bina par tikaa hoga ki pati ne lagaataar teen baar talaak nahin kaha
 Such opponents were described as 'pro-slavery' and 'pseudo-secular'
 antatru sarvocch adaalat ne talaak-e-biddat ko avaidh qaraar dete hue ek santulit faisla diya, jisamen dharmik swatantraaa ko akshunn rakhaa gaya or saath hi rudhipoon se judi vikrutiyon ko katar diya gaya
 Now the government has put a bill in Parliament, which not only repeats the verdict of the Supreme Court, but also declares triple talaq as a crime, bypassing the concern of 'slavery supporters'
 vidheyak ke uddeshy or kaaran se sambandhit bayaan bhramit karne vaala haih isamen daawa kiya gaya he ki faisle ne sarkaar ke paksh kii pushti kii he
 No bill needs such a claim, it is just propaganda, it is not the purpose of this bill
 bayaan main daawa kiya gaya he ki sarvocch adaalat kaa faisla teen talaak ko rokane main naakaam sabit hua he or yah ab bhi chalan main he
 Hence its violation was proposed to be punitive
 aise koi aankade yaa phir byore uplabdh nahin hai, jisase pataa chale ki ise aparaadh ghoshit kiye jane se aisa koun-sa uddeshy puraa hoga jo is faisle ke baad kanoonee rup se sambhav nahin he
 The bill only reinforces the so-called 'pseudo-secularists' fear that it is not about Muslim women; In the patriarchal format, this bill reduces the existing right of Muslim women
 sabase pehle, yah teen talaak ko avaidh ghoshit karata he (jo ki pehle se he), iske baad isamen sambandhit mahila ko pati se maamuli guzaara bhatta lene kaa adhikaar he
 In this way, the Bill limits the economic rights related to a woman's expenditure, while she is entitled to the Protection of Women and Domestic Violence Act, 2005, through which she gets the appropriate allowance to fulfill her marital home lifestyle
 The right to demand
 doosraa, vidheyak main talaak ke baad avyask bacchon ko mahila ke sangrakshan main rakhane kaa praavdhaan he
 This provision does not match the unprecedented changes made in the secular protection law
 yah bal sangrakshan siddhant ke kalyaan ke anusaar sangrakshan ke maamalon par sangrakshak adaalaton ke kshetradhikaron kaa ulanghan karata he
 Thirdly, directing a person to jail as well as giving compensation to them is like torturing excessively, because it is a crime that cannot be done before the utterance of the three divorces and there is no legal effect before that
 Happen
 teen baar talaak kehane ke 'aparaadh' ko usee tarah mana ja rahaa he, maano yah patni kaa nirantar shaareerik, maansik yaa yon utpeeda ho, iske alaava isamen bhartiya dand vidhaan kii dhara 498 e ke tahat teen saal kii adhiktam sajaa bhi ho sakati he
 In addition, the Bill makes triple talaq a bigger crime than any of the offenses under the Protection of Women and Domestic Violence Act
 kanoon ke 'durupyog' ke shor-sharabe ke bich, muslim purushon ko nishaanaa banaaya janaa tab acha lag saktaa he, jab aap yah vichaar karen ki kisi vyakti ko uski patni ke maukhik bayaan ke aadhaar par doshi tehraaya ja saktaa he ki usne use teen talaak de diya he
 The remaining money left by the Central Government's recent announcement that now women will also be able to go on Haj without any men
 sarkaar ne yah bataanaa jaruri nahin samajha ki yah vyavastha saudi arab ne kii he or bharat kaa isse koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 It does not matter that the traveling women are from India, and they will not be allowed to enter Saudi Arabia without a man
 mudda yah he ki sarkaar muslim samudaay ko nishaanaa bananaa chaahati he or saath hi yah bhi dikhaanaa chaahati he ki vah samudaay kii mahilaon kii maseehaa he
 Was Muslim women really consulted while drafting this bill? Malvika Rajkotia is a lawyer and author of Intimacy Undane, a book focusing on marriage and divorce laws in India

 As soon as Narendra Modi's 'hat-trick' era in Gujarat and Rahul Gandhi's ascension to second place in Congress, it seems that the 2014 general election will be Rahul versus Modi
 2014 ke aam chunaav main desh ko do sabase badi partiyaan bhidengi to ho saktaa he ki ye muqabla narendra modi banaam rahul gandhi kaa ho jaae
 a few days ago we asked 10 questions related to Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi on the topic 'choose your Prime Minister in a minute: Who is more close to the next Prime Minister of India?'
 aap sabhi ne isamen bad-chadh kar hissaa liya or apane pasand ke ummidavaar ko jam kar vot diya
 Now is the time for results
 
 
 todekhie kise kya mila
 
 
 Modi has got his iron out by hitting a hat-trick in Gujarat, while Rahul Gandhi has not been able to prove himself even after all the efforts
 gujarat main modi ne apni chhavi vikaas purush ke taur par banaai he, rahul gandhi bhi apane tareeke se vikaas kii baat karte hai
 Narendra Modi is a big political strategist
 wo dabang style main raajnneeti karte hai
 Not only outside the party but also within the party, they do not allow their opponents to raise their heads
 gujarat chunaav ke thik pehle unhone sanjay joshi ko jis tarah se baahar kaa rasta dikhva diya
 This is one way of his politics
 vikaas kaa unhone apana modul taiyaar kiya he
 Be it Vibrant Gujarat or whether it is a matter of bringing the Nano plant from Singur to Delhi, Narendra Modi knows how to hit the spot
 sabase badi baat ye he ki unka apana ek janaadhar he
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi is constantly working for his organization
 rahul gandhi bhi lambii ranneeti ke tahat kaam karte hai
 Instead of taking any major position in the government, they are working to irrigate the organization
 unhone congress sanghathan ko kaaphi had tak organij kiya he
 Right now the responsibility of the Election Committee of the party is on him, Rahul Gandhi travels continuously
 logon ke bich jate hai
 He is adept at drawing crowds, but the question is how much of the crowd gathered to see and hear them turn into votes
 america congress kii ek report main bhi kaha gaya he ki 2014 ke aam chunaav se pehle bharat main pradhanmantri pad ke sambhavit ummidavaaron ko lekar bahes jor pakad rahi he or gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi or congress netaa rahul gandhi ke bich sidhaa muqabla ho saktaa he
 Before moving to the politics of the Center, Modi has many obstacles in his way from his party, yet it has not been decided whether the Congress will present Rahul Gandhi as PM in 2014, but if so If it happens, the competition will be very interesting

 Setting the Media Agenda According to data from the Internet and Mobile Association of India, 137 million people in India use the Internet, 68 million people have Facebook accounts and 18 million people on Twitter
 yah aankade lagaataar bad rahe hai
 The importance of social networking site in the political field has also become necessary because firstly it has added the middle class of India and secondly it does not have to go through any editor, news anchor before giving any political information
 aap khud logon se sidhe judate hai, to iske phaayde bahut hai
 Apart from this, another advantage is that the political party makes its agenda easy to reach the media through this
 jaise pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii pakistan ke raashtrapati asif ali jaradaari kii baithak kii ek tasviir post kar di gai jiske baad media ne is khabar ko uthaa liya
 Now the work of the team which is active in the social media of BJP and Congress, is to handle Twitter, youtube, Internet, TV feed, mobile application, blog well
 isse soochnaaon kaa pravaah thik bana rahata he, party janata ke saath sidhaa judati he or media ko bhi khabar kii soochna yahaan se mil jaati he

 manish tiwari kehete hai, isse aapako har ek shaks se judane kii jarurat nahin hoti, aapaki soochna sidhaa 2000 logon tak pahunchati he
 'or information 1 in case of Shashi Tharoor
 6 milian logon tak aapaki baat pahunch jaati he
 Shashi Tharoor is one of the most active politicians in social media
 lekin soshal media main sakriyata inke liye kai baar pareshaani kaa sabab bhi bana he
 Tharoor has been in controversy many times over his tweet
 lekin kul milakar raajnneeti se jude log samaj gaye hai ki aaj ke daur main yuvaaon, shahari logon ke bich jagah banane ke liye soshal media kaa khaasaa mahatv he or ise nazarandaaj nahin kiya ja saktaa
