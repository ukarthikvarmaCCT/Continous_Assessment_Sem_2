 The last 54-minute conversation between the pilots of the missing plane of Malaysia Airlines and the control tower has been revealed by a newspaper
 da telegraph ke mutabik, laapata malaysian vimaan emech 370 ke ko-payalat farik abdul hamid or niyantran tower ke bich 8 march ko baatcheet raat 12:15 baje shuru hui
 At 1:19 pm, Hamid said in the last message, 'all is well, good night
 ' The investigators claim that the conversation started when the plane was tampered with and their report states that the conversation appears to be 'completely everyday', but still two unusual things emerge
 vishleshkon kii drushti main pehali asaamaanya baat yah he ki raat 1:07 baje sandesh main kaha gaya ki vimaan 35000 foot kii oonchai par he
 The same message was repeated at an interval of six minutes
 aircraft communication adressing and reporting system (asieares) bhi antim sandesh bheje jane ke 30 minute baad sambhavat: jaanboojhkar niskriy kar diya gaya
 Investigators believe that ACARS was closed before Hamid delivered the final message at 1:19 pm
 ek alag transponder ko 1:21 baje band kar diya gaya tha
 Another unusual point of view from investigators is that the missing plane is not an accident
 sampark tut jane ke baad vimaan ko pashchim kii disha main us bindu par mode diya gaya, jab kualalampur ke vaayu yatayaat niyantrak uskaa niyantran ho chi minh ke hawaale karte hai
 a former pilot of Boeing 777, British Airways, Stephen Bajdegan said, 'if i had to steal the plane, i would have done it at the same point
 vimaan yatayaat niyantrakon ke bich kuch duuri ded spes hoti he
 This is the time during which the aircraft cannot be seen from the ground
 ' This new revelation is going to bolster the presumption of whether the missing MH370 was an accident or a kidnapping
 yadi payalton kaa gumshudagi main haath hota he to ve apni manshaa chhipaane main atyant satark rahete hai

 america raashtrapati donald trump ke saath mulaakaat karne se pehle hi uttar korea kaa shaasha kim jong un america se chidh gaya he
 And angry, he has also threatened to cancel the meeting on 12 June in Singapore
 lekin sawaal ye he ki akhir kyon bidak gaya kim jong un? kyon dikhaae usne puraane tevar? to vajah ye he ki ek taraf to america kim par dabaav bana rahaa he ki wo apane parmaanu kaarykram band kar de or duusari taraf wo dakshin korea ke saath milakar military drill bhi kar rahaa he
 In such a situation Kim had to be angry
 'maiks thunder' se gussaya kim jong un!ek taraf to america korian peninsula main shanti ke liekim jong unase ye ummid karata he ki wo apni newclear site ko nasht kar de
 On the other side, Trump's army along with South Korea is conducting military drills
 maiks thunder naam se is joint drill main sau se zyaada airplane istemaal hue
 In which dozens of fighter planes, bombers and transport aircraft from the US and South Korea showed their jeweler
 magar america ke is johar ne uttar korea ke marshall kim jong un ko tevar main laa diya he
 Marshall threatens to cancel the meeting! Will Yarana happen after years? yaa phir band ho jaaegi korian peninsula main aman kii koshish
 And again North Korea and South will become enemies
 ye wo sawaal hai jo phir se uthne lage hai
 Because if Kim and Trump's meeting on June 12 is canceled, then there will be war again which probably will not be good news for the world
 america se naaraaz hua uttar korea!sawaal ye he ki ab tak apni kootneeti se sabko hairaan kar dene vaale or apane parmaanu kaarykram ko band karne ke liye taiyaar baithe kim jong un ko achaanak gussa kyon aa gaya
 So listen, the first reason for Kim's anger is the military drill that the United States is doing together with South Korea in Korean peninsula
 jabaki duusari taraf wo kim se ye ummid kar rahaa he ki wo prayadweep main shanti kii pahal kare
 Kim's anger at this double strategy of America is justified
 vahiin is gusse kii duusari vajah ye he ki trump ke saath meeting se pehle america kii badhati maangon se uttar korea pareshaan ho gaya he
 Kimagar is angry with the military drill, if this meeting was postponed, then the threat of a big war from the world seemed to be erased
 wo phir se mandaraane lagegaa
 And once again everything will start to look the same as it was before North Korea and South Korea met
 america or dakshin korea kii military drill se kim is kadar taish main aa gaye hai ki unhone dakshin korea ke saath 16 may ko hone vaali baatcheet bhi radd kar di
 It seems that the friendship between North Korea and South Korea can once again wear hostility
 radd ho sakati he kim or trump kii mulakatjis america ke kehane par uttar korea ke taanashaah kim jong ne parmaanu pareekshan na karne kaa vaada kiya wo vaada tut saktaa he
 Not only this, the much-awaited meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore on 12 June may also be canceled
 darasal kim ke gusse kii ek vajalmericake rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar jon bolton kaa wo bayaan bhi he jisamen unhone uttar korea ke liye libya model kaa zikr kiya he
 Kim's Minister gave this statement
 The North Korean state media has issued the statement of Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Ke-guan
 bayaan main guan ne kaha ki agar america hamen darkinar kar sirf ekatarfa ye maang karata he ki ham apane parmaanu kaarykram ko band kar den to ham is tarah kii baatcheet ke paksh main nahin hai
 We will also consider the upcoming meeting between the US and North Korea
 libya model se tulana karne par bhadkaa gussajon bolton ne jis libya model kaa zikr kiya he uske tahat libya ke purv shaasha karnal gaddaphi ne parmaanu nishastreekaran kiya tha
 But Gaddafi was assassinated 1 year after Libya's nuclear weapons were destroyed
 hatya ko nato samarthit libya ke vidrohiyon ne anjaam diya tha
 In such a situation, when the Libyan model for North Korea was mentioned, Kim Jong Un's anger reached the seventh sky
 garmjoshi ho gai rafuchakkaruttar korea ke is rukh se abhi 3 din pehle tak america or dakshin korea se uski jo garmjoshi thi wo rafuchakkar ho gai he
 However, the US has not yet ruled out the possibility of Trump and Kim meeting
 uttar korea kaa ye tevar bataa rahaa he ki agar 12 june ko kim jong un or donald trump kii mulaakaat hui bhi to sab kuch america kii script ke mutabik nahin hoga

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne mangalvaar ko sultanpur se samaajawaadee party ke chunavi prachaar kaa shankhanaad kiya
 Why Akhilesh chose Sultanpur for the first election meeting is a question on everyone's tongue
 darasal, sultanpur main paanchaven charan main 27 farvari ko matdaan hona he
 In such a situation, the Samajwadi Party workers are also surprised about the Yaksha question of why the Chief Minister left for the first phase or the second phase elections
 ek theory ye bhi di ja rahi he ki akhilesh ne sambhavat: pashchimi uttar pradesh se prachaar kaa aagaaj isliye nahin kiya kyonki wo chaahate the ki vahaan pehle charan ke namakan puure ho jaaen
 Also, the situation should be completely clear about the swapping of seats in the coalition

 ye to saaf nahin hua ki akhilesh kisi jyotishi ke kehane par aisa kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 However, Jyotishacharya Rishi Dwivedi, executive member of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi, says that because Akhilesh Yadav is the Virgo Ascendant of Gemini and Aquarius is a lucky place from Gemini
 iske parinaam swarup bhagya akshar 'su' aata he
 Sultanpur is related to this, it will bring luck
 jahaan tak vaastu kaa sawaal he to akhilesh yadav ke janm sthal saifai se sultanpur purv disha main padataa he
 The reason behind the opening from Sultanpur may be that the sun gets faster and more benefits, so the place of origin of the sun has been chosen

 kya aapako nattha yaad he? film pipli live ke pipli gaanv kaa nattha jiske khudakushi kii taarikh kii khabar tamaasha ban jaati he
 The system was shaken when a farmer decided to commit suicide
 2010 main aamir khan ne jis gaanv se prerana lekar film pipli live banaai or jis kirdaar se nattha kaa kirdaar prabhavit hua ajtak kii team usee gaanv main pahunchi
 Sesra, a small village near Betul district, about 200 km from Bhopal, the capital of the electoral state of Madhya Pradesh, is where Natha alias Key Lal Malviya of Peepli Live
 saal 2003 main kunjee laal malviya ne apane marane kii bhavishyavaanee kii thi or sehara gaanv main apane ghar ke thik saamne chote se mandir main jaakar baith gaye the
 For the first time in the area, news of the prediction of the death of a person spread like wildfire and the government's camp including media administration sat in this village with a fair
 kunjee laal malviya ab 90 saal ke ho chuke hai
 Age has dominated the body, so the body cannot move much
 kuch yaad aata he to kisse bayaan karte hai ki kaise unhone apane marane kii bhavishyavaanee kar di
 Keylal says that his father comes to read his father and his horoscope and at the age of 75 he feared his death but the matter was leaked through a journalist and created an uproar
 ghatana ke 7 saal baad aamir khan ne inhen kunjee laal malviya kii kahani ke aadhaar par pipli live banaai or nattha kaa kirdaar sajaayaa
 Ram Lakhan, a resident of Sehra village, still remembers that incident and explains, "at that time there was an urban upheaval in the village
 kunjee laal ke ghar kii aas-paas kii kachi chhaton par log chadh gaye the
 ‚ÄúA lot has changed in Key Lal‚Äôs village now
 gaanv main pakki sadaken ban gai hai, skool ban gaye hai, anganwari centre bhi ban gaye hai or praathmik swasthya kii bhi vyavastha ho gai he
 That's why Keylal openly praises his state's Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 dada kunjeelal mamaa shivaraj se bilkul naaraaz nahin hai
 He says, "the picture of his village and the entire Betul has changed now than before
 shivaraj ne 15 saal raaj kiya lekin acha kaam kiya
 "but in this real-life village there are many people of his age who are very angry with the Shivraj government
 ped ke paas lagi bujurgon kii panchayat main baithe 78 saal ke dada parashuram kehete hai, "is baar bhi sab aakar kah rahe hai bijli bill maaf ho jayega, karja maaf ho jayega sab maaf ho jayega, itnaa pani de denge ki ghar dub jayega
 They have been hearing this for years, but nothing happened, nothing was forgiven or water was found
 pichhali baar bhi yahi kaha tha lekin kuch bhi nahin kiya
 Every time you give assurance but do nothing
 15 saal se he vah lekin unhen kuch nahin kiya
 "the people of the village complain that the leader who came to ask for votes last time, he could never be seen again after the voting took place
 isi gaanv ke rahane vaale anuj kaa kahana he, "netaa ji ko vot padane ke agle din baad se gaanv main kisi ne nahin dekha kabhi lautakar nahin aae is gaanv main aaj tak nahin dikhaai pade
 Now days are seen everyday
 apana kaam karaane unke ghar jaao to bhale vah ghar main rahe kehete hai dilli gum rahe bhopal gum rahe hai america gum rahe hai
 They are never seen after the votes are cast
 "isi gaanv ke kisaan ramkishor kaa kahana he kii fasal jo vahi bechney par laagat bhi nahin nikalati nateeja parivaar 2 june kii roti khushi se nahin kha paata or jindagi bas ghate main chalati he
 Ramkishore says that for 3 years the cost of farming has not been able to come out, so he takes a loan from the bank and pays the wages
 gaanv ke yuvaaon main bhi khaasi naaraazgi he or berogari unke saamne sabase bada mudda he
 Deepak, who is doing BSC and Santosh doing BCA, says that he is worried about his future right now
 santosh or deepak kaa kahana he ki gaanv ke mushkil se 10% yuvaaon ko hi rojgaar mil paaya or aise main padhane likhane ke baad unke paas koi kaam hoga yaa nahin hoga is baat kii phikr he
 Both these youth believe that Shivraj's government did not pay attention to employment and hence both of these youth are talking about change in this election
 berogari ke alaava sehara gaanv kii sabase badi samasya pine ke pani kii kami he
 At the last corner of Sehra village, long queues of women, plastic bins and gagrias on the road, as well as water flowing through the tubewell pipes, are opening up the entire narrative of the Shivraj government's development claims
 jin bacchon ko skool main hona chahie vah bachche sar par pani se bharaa hua bartan le jate najar aate hai taaki pyaas buje
 The situation is so bad that even water is not available daily
 auraten kahati hai ki kaam dham chhodkar isi tubewel ke pipe ke paas aapas main ladate jhagadate pani bharne aati hai joki roj naseeb nahin hota
 If water comes one day, then not the next day, in such a way that one gets as much as his share
 ajtak se baatcheet karte hue lakshmi ne kaha, "yah tubewel bhi farvari-march tak hi chalata he or thandi main bhi pine kaa pani roj nahin miltaa
 Children also have to come for help and many times the line is so high that women fight among themselves
 har baar chunaav main vaada karke jate hai ki pine kaa pani denge lekin saalon se yahaan kuch nahin badla
 "it is not that nothing has happened in a small village in Betul
 kai buniyadi suvidhaayen gaanv main pahunch gai hai, lekin pine kaa pani or do roti ke liye rojgaar ab bhi sabase badi samasya he jiske liye yah gaanv roj sangharsh karata he
 This struggle now gives them the greed to complete every promise in the election promise, but this village is unaware of the system's indifference

 mahatma gandhi ke baad aaazaad bharat main jis ek shakhsiyat kii raajnneetik viraasat par kabje ke liye partiyon main sabase zyada pratispardhaa rahi he wo hai samvidhan nirmaataa baba sahib bhim raav ambedkar
 The country is celebrating his 126th birth anniversary today
 baba sahib ke nidhan ko 60 saal se zyada ho chuke hai lekin aaj bhi centre or desh ke adhikansh rajyon main sattarudh bhartiya janata party se lekar congress jaise sabase puraane tathaa bispi, arpiai jaise kshetreey dalon main bhi khud ko baba sahib kii vichaardhaara ke zyada se zyada kareebi bataae jane kii hode machi rahati he
 Born on 14 April 1891 in a Dalit family of Madhya Pradesh, Baba Saheb, despite having an extraordinary talent, suffered untouchability throughout his life
 isaki shuruyaat unke bachapan se hi ho gai thi jab unhone skool janaa shuru kiya or 1923 main videsh se ucch shiksha grahan kar jab ve bharat laute tab bhi halaat main kuch zyada badlaav nahin aayaa tha
 From then on Baba Saheb made it his only goal in his life to give the Dalits equal rights
 unhone kai kitaaben likhin or hindu dharm kii kuritiyon par prahaar kiya
 During this time, some such incidents also happened due to which they had to face strong opposition from upper castes
 mahad satyagrah1927 main unke dwaara shuru kiya gaya mahad satyagrah isi disha main ek ullekhneey ghatana thi
 Actually at that time, Dalits were not allowed to take water from ponds and wells meant for upper castes
 agast 1923 ko bombai legislative council ne ek prastaav paas kiya ki sabhi sarkari talabon kaa istemaal har koi kar saktaa he
 Mahad was also a part of the Bombay jurisdiction but could not be implemented due to the opposition of upper caste Hindus
 baba sahib ne ise chunauti dene kii thaanee or apane saath hajaaron daliton ko lekar 20 march 1927 ko unhone mahad ke saarvajanik chavadaar talab se pani piyaa
 Even today, on March 20, Social Empowerment Day is made in memory of that event
 kalaram mandir main praveshsaarvajanik talabon kii tarah us samay mandiron main bhi daliton ke pravesh par sakht pabandi thi
 Ambedkar's argument was that if God is for everyone then why only people of upper castes can visit his temple
 2 march 1930 ko nasik ke prasiddh kalaram mandir ke baahar dow bhimrao ambedkar ke netritv main aitihaasik virodh pradarshan kiya gaya, jiske parinamswaroop daliton ko mandir main pravesh kii ijaajat mili
 This incident proved to be a milestone in the Dalit movement in India
 hindu paidaa to hua hum, lekin hindu maruunga nahimbedkar jis takat ke saath daliton ko unka haq dilaane ke liye unhen ekajute karne or raajnneetik-saamaajik rup se unhen shashakt banane main jute the, utani hi takat ke saath unke virdohi bhi unhen rokane ke liye jor laga rahe the
 After a long struggle, when Ambedkar was convinced that he could not remove the evils of caste system and untouchability from Hinduism, he gave the historical statement in which he said that i am born a Hindu, but a Hindu will not die
 hindu code bill par virodhazadee ke baad pandit nehru ke mantrimandal main doctor ambedkar kanoon mantri bane or nehru kii pahal par unhone hindu code bill taiyaar kiya lekin is bill ko lekar bhi unhen jabardast virodh jhelana padaa
 Nehru himself was then seen bowing to the increasing pressure on this issue inside and outside his party
 is mudde par matbhed is kadar bade ki ambedkar ne kanoon mantri ke pad se istipha de diya
 Although the Hindu Code Bill was later passed and it also revolutionized the status of Hindu women, it was flexible in many respects with Ambedkar's bill

 In most cases such a subsidy was given through a fake voter card, on which the address was registered, which was taken in the name

 Its purpose was to promote small scale irrigation techniques

 Maulvi and teacher Maulana Salman Nadvi, a prominent member of its executive, were dismissed by the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB)
 un par iljaam tha ki ve ayodhya vivaad ke adaalat se baahar sambhavit nibatare ke liye art of living ke sansthaapak shri shri ravishankar se mili, vah bhi us vakt jab is vivaad par philhal supreme court main sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The board insisted that Nadvi was not authorized to meet Ravi Shankar
 kaaryakarini ke sadsy kamaal faruki or jafarayab jilani ne kaha ki nadvi ne ''board kii raay se alag rukh akhriyaar karke muslim hiton ko baari nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 That place belongs to the Muslims and will remain the site of Babri Masjid
 "naaraaz nadvi ne kaha ki board se hataae jane se pehle unhone khud hi ise chhod diya tha
 They wept bitterly in front of the students of Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulema Madrasa of Lucknow
 unhone kaha, ''main to aman laane kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 Allah will deal with those who are doing injustice to me
 "magar reportron se baat karte vakt ve zyada aakraamak mudra main the
 "the board has been hijacked by extremists," he said
 yah taanaashaahee he
 What is wrong in dealing with the issue with mutual consent and thus avoiding the situation of rioting when the court verdict comes? "according to Nadvi, the matter can be" resolved within three months "by negotiation
 unki barkhaastagi (yaa board se unke baahar aane) ko mote taur par ravishankar kii madhyasthata vaali ummiido ke liye jhatka mana gaya
 But some analysts are also saying that they have exposed the divisions within the board
 shri shri ne apane doot gautam wig ko board ke un sadasyon ke saath baatcheet karne kii jimmedaari saunpi thi jo adaalat ke baahar samjhaute ke paksh main ho sakate hai
 "gurudev feels that the decision of the court cannot bring the hearts together," says Vig
 haarane vaala paksh takalif mahasoos karegaa
 "nadvi's supporter and retired IAS officer Anees Ansari was among the delegation that met Ravi Shankar in Bengaluru on 8 February
 ansaari daawa karte hai ki ''adaalat ke faisle ke natijatan khoonkhraba hoga kyonki hinduon or musalamaanon donon main yah bhaavana majboot he ki yah jameen unki he
 As soon as there is any attempt to remove the idols kept there or on the other side, to build a temple at that place, then there will be bloodshed
 isliye sabase acha rasta aisa samjhauta he jo donon pakshon ke liye sammanjanak ho
 Concerned about appearing too compromised and excessively soft, Ansari said he argued on behalf of Nadvi that any negotiated settlement can be extended only if the Hindu prosecution accepts it That Muslims only own the land
 iske alaava is baat kii vidhaayi kism kii koi guarantee honi chahie ki musalamaanon kii duusari ibaadatgahon ke saath aisi koi chhedchhad nahin hogi
 His references to other prayers probably refer to the disputed sites of Kashi and Mathura
 iske alaava ansaari ne kaha ki ''babari masjid ko gaiyr-kanoonee tareeke se shahid kiye jane ke liye jimmedaar logon ko sajaa bhi honi chahie
 "according to the vig, Ravi Shankar emphasized that this discussion would be more effective if both Hindus and Muslims agreed to construct the Ram temple at the disputed site and to construct the mosque elsewhere
 ravishankar kaa daawa he ki baatcheet ke jariye vivaad kaa samaadhaan nikaalane kii disha main jab unhone board ke sadasyon se sampark sadhana shuru kiya, to 51 sadasyeey board ke kareeb ek tihaai sadsy unki baton se sahamat dikhe
 Lok Sabha MP from Hyderabad Asaduddin Owaisi accused Nadvi of "dancing at the behest of Prime Minister Modi" while attacking him
 ovaisi ne nadvi ke dastakhat kiye gaye ek puraane fatve, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki ''ek masjid qayaamat tak masjid hi rahati he" kaa hawala dete hue aahvaan kiya ki jo log masjid par apana haq chhodane kii baat kehete hai, vaise logon kaa bahishkaar kiya janaa chahie
 However, Nadvi told Ravi Shankar that the Hambali ideology, one of the four major ideologies of Sunni Muslims, allows a mosque to be moved from one place to another
 is lihaaj se babari masjid ko vivaadit sthal se dur kisi or sthaan par dobaaraa banaaya ja saktaa he
 According to Ravi Shankar, "many Muslim leaders from every corner of India met me and supported my efforts towards a compromise on both sides for the construction of the temple at the disputed site and the mosque at some distance
" "uttar pradesh ke shiya vakf board ne ravishankar kaa khuledil se samarthan kiya
 However, the Sunni parties are saying that the matter is in the court and that the Shias do not have any right to keep their views on this dispute
 baharhaal, us vivaadit jameen kaa malikana haq rakhane vaali sanstha uttar pradesh sunni vakf board ke adhyaksh jafar faruki bhi moulana nadvi ke saath ravishankar kii us mulaakaat main shaamil the
 By the way, the atmosphere is beginning to be formed
 ravishankar jaldi hi ek baar phir ayodhya jaaenge or november kii tarah ek baar phir se is maamle ke hindu or musalmaan pakshakaron ke saath baatcheet kaa ek nayaa daur shuru karenge
 Their contact with Muslim Personal Law Board members is now expected to be greater than before
 bhaajapa or sangh parivaar baatcheet kii is prakriya main shaamil nahin ho rahaa balki vah baahar se paini najar banaae hue he
 Senior BJP leader and petitioner Subrahmanyam Swamy has doubts over the success of the talks
 haalanki ve daawa karte hai ki aapasi rajamandi kaayam karne kii ek naakaam koshish ateet main ve bhi kar chuke hai
 They do not think that Muslims will agree to build a temple at the disputed site because they fear that they will be targeted by the fundamentalists
 swami kehete hai ki ravishankar kii ''pahal kaa swaagat he
 But the best way would be to get a clear judgment from the court
 jo sakshya hai unke aadhaar par mujhe puraa bharosa he ki adaalat vivaadit sthal par mandir banaae jane ke paksh main hi nirnay degi
 "the Prime Minister's view on this is still unclear
 unhone chaturipurn chuppi saadh rakhi he
 But the political benefit of Ravi Shankar's success will definitely be available
 modi kii lambey samay se khwaahish rahi he ki unhen hinduon or musalamaanon, donon kaa netaa samajha jaae
 By the way, Ravi Shankar's success is considered to be a dream casserole at the moment
 phir bhi yadi ravishankar ke prayaason se vivaadit sthal par mandir nirmaan or kisi anya sthaan par masjid nirmaan kii rajamandi ho jaati he to vah modi ko zyada raas aegi kyonki adaalat se jo nirnay aayega, usamen is baat kii sambhaavna kam hi he ki vah kisi ek paksh ko bahut khush kar paaegaa

 While the BJP is trying to prove Kejriwal government's move wrong, on the other hand, patients being treated at Max Hospital have started protesting
 shalimaar baag kemex aspataalmen ilaaj kara rahe marijon kaa kahana he ki is aspataal ke band ho jane ke baad unke paas achche aspataalon kaa vikalp kam ho gaya
 In fact, patients claim that the government hospitals in that area do not get good treatment
 aise main unke paas maiks hi ek aisa vikalp bachaa tha, jahaan wo apana ilaaj kara sakate the
 Aaj Tak's team inspected the government hospitals in that area over the recent issue of Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini
 sabase pehle hamaari team pahunchi rohinee ke doctor ambedkar aspataal main
 It is a very old hospital
 rojaanaa yahaan hajaaron log ilaaj karaane aate hai
 Aaj Tak's team tried to know from the patients being treated here what they think about this hospital
 logon kaa kahana tha ki ham bahut khush hai sarkari aspataal ke ilaaj se
 Mayank said that his wife is undergoing treatment here
 unki patni kii delivery yahi hui he
 But he had no problem
 jab hamane poocha ki agarmax aspatalband hota he to unhen kya dikkat hogi?is sawaal par unka kahana tha ki agarmax aspatalband hota he to unhen koi pareshaani nahin hogi or naa hi unhen is baat se koi fark padataa he
 Medicines are available on time in government hospitals and special care is also being taken for cleanliness nowadays
 doctor kaa vyavhaar bhi bahut acha rahata he
 The robbery is in private hospital
 jaraa si dikkat par sidhaa oparation hi hota he
 If Max is closed then we don't mind
 mongolpuri main sanjay gandhi aspataal se bhi log khushaiske baad hamaari team pahunchi mongolpuri ke sanjay gandhi aspataal main
 It is also a large government hospital, where thousands of patients come for treatment every day
 yahaan ke marijon se bhi ajtak kii team ne baat kii
 People used to say that we get good treatment here
 naa ilaaj par kharch or naa hi dawaaon par zyada kharch hota he
 It is not a matter of the common people to bear the expenses of private hospitals
 maiks aspatalband ho jaae, hamen usase koi fark nahin padataa or naa hi is baat se koi pareshaani he
 An old woman, who had been undergoing treatment at Sanjay Gandhi Hospital all her life, said that i had her treated at the same hospital
 nijee aspataal main ilaaj karaati to shaayad ghar bik chukaa hota
 The patient outside Max is still upset when Semax is banned, since then the patients who have been undergoing treatment here for months are getting very upset
 aaj bhi kuch aise marij mili, jinhen oparation ke liye yaa chekup ke liye aaj kii date di gai thi
 But they are not being treated
 marijon ne kaha 'hamen manaa kar diya
 The hospital says the OPD has been discontinued
 ' Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt, convicted in the 1993 Mumbai Blast case under Arms Act, has received a major relief from the Supreme Court
 court ne sanju baba ko sarender karne ke liye chaar hafte kii mohalat di he
 However, earlier on Tuesday, the court rejected the application of Jabunnisa Anwar Kazi
 gauratlab he ki 1993 mumbai bam blast ke ek maamle main supreme court ne sanjay dutt ko arms act ke tahat paanch saal kii sajaa sunai thi
 They had to surrender by 18 April
 jabunnisa ne bhi sanjay kii tarah apni arji main sarender karne ke liye mohalat maangi thi
 Sanjay Dutt filed an application in the Supreme Court on Monday to extend the surrender period
 unhone vyavsaayik kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue sarender karne ke liye 6 maheene kaa or vakt maanga tha
 Hearing the petition of Sanjay Dutt, the Supreme Court said that there is no scope of major relief in this case, although you can end your professional responsibilities, you can be given a four-week extension
 iske saath supreme court ne yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki aage unhen koi or mohalat nahin milegi
 Justice P
 sadashivam kii adhyakshata vaali supreme court kii peeth ne is yachika kii sunwaayee karte hue maanviya aadhaar par yah faisla diya
 The petition of three convicts, including Jabunnisa, was rejected
 It is a matter of fact that the Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed the similar plea of three convicts in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts case
 jabunnisa anwar kaaji, ishahaak mohammad or shahrif abdul kii arji khaarij hui thi
 All three have been sentenced to five years under the Arms Act

 Jabunnisa had pleaded for relief from the court citing her age
 70 saal kii jabunnisa kidney ke cancer se peedit hai, uskaa ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Jabunnisa said in her petition that she not only needs to be constantly under the care of doctors, but also always a caregiver
 usne kaha tha ki is haalat main jail main rahete hue vah batch nahin paaegi
 Global Artificial Intelligence Conference was held in Shanghai
 Owners Jack Ma and Elon Musk put their thoughts on AI at a Global Artificial Intelligence Conference held in Shanghai Musk expressed his views on AI
 donon ke vichaar AI ko lekar alag-alag the
 a lot of topics were discussed in this conference, but most attention was taken with AI
 AI ko lekar bahes isliye bhi jari rahaa kyonki mahaan vaigyanik stephen hawking ne kabhi chetavanee dete hue kaha tha ki ye ek din antat: maanavtaa ko khatm kar degaa
 During the conference, while giving his views on AI, Jack Ma said that computers are very clever, but humans are smarter
 insaanon ne computer ko banaaya he, lekin maine kabhi nahin dekha ki kisi insaan ko computer ne banaaya ho
 Further, the e-commerce giant said for himself that 'i'm not a tech cow' (information about my technology is less)
 mujhe aisa lagata he ki insaanon ko behatar samajhane main AI madad kar saktaa he
 i do not think this is a threat to humans
 vahiin duusari taraf alon musk ne apane vichaar rakhte hue kaha ki jis teji se computer advance hote ja rahe hai wo hairaan karne vaala he
 Imagine that super-fast artificial intelligent devices might someday get tired of cordoning off a slow and dull person
 kuch or ho naa ho to computer baichaiyn ho jaaenge
 It would be like talking to trees
 musk ne aage kaha ki insaanon kii ummiden isi main thik hai ki computing power kaa istemaal kar saath donon saath main dur tak jaaen
 Musk further said that at the moment they are just like Cyborg
 ham apane phone or computers se kaaphi behatar tareeke se integrated hai
 The phone is like your extension
 agar aap apana phone bhul jaaen to aapako apana ek hissaa chhodane ke baraabar lagegaa
 At the same time, Jack Ma further said that humans will get more rest by having AI
 kyonki AI, transport, fiding or dharti vaasiyon ke bare main sochane jaise kaam kar legaa
 He further said that with the advancement of technology, people will need to work for only three days in a week and only for four hours
 isi tarah donon main bahes jari rahi
 But both agreed on one thing that human death is a good thing, because every generation brings new ideas to the global challenges facing us
 jaik maa ne kaha ki maranaa acha he to vahiin musk ne kaha ki haa ye sahi baat he

 Fazal Ismail, a relative of Sama, says that this area is adjacent to Pakistan

 The news of the death of about 40 people had already come, but now it is also reported that hundreds of animals and birds have also died in the floods in Amreli forests
 inamen sabase chaunkaanewaali khabar sheron ke bare main ai he
 So far eight lions have been reported dead
 sheron kii maut kii khabar ne wild life se vaasta rakhanevaale logon ko to chintaa main daal hi diya he, aam naagarik bhi sheron kii maut kii khabar se chintaa main hai
 After all, Babbar lions are found all over the world only in this area of gujarat
 pichley saalon main jaise-jaise sheron kii basti badi vaise-vaise unka vistaar bhi badhata gaya
 Apart from the Gir forests, Amreli district has the largest number of lions
 antim sheron kii gananaa ke mutabik amarelli ke kracch or lilia ilaake ke jangalon main hi kareeb 176 sher rahete hai
 This time when the flood occurred, the water of the Shetrunji river also spread in this area
 ab pani utraa he to logon ko kai jagahon par sheron ke shav dikhaai die hai
 The lion lovers of Krakach and Lilia region of Amreli say that they had already warned the forest department that these lions should be removed from the plains of the Shetrunji river to the hilly areas before the monsoon knocks There is no danger to their life in this situation
 ye sangrakshit jaanavar hai or sirf desh hi nahin, balki puri duniya ke liye ye anmol dharohar hai
 Saving them should be given the highest priority
 unka aarope he ki van vibhaag ne unki chetavanee ko halke main liya, jiskaa nateeja ye he ki itane sharon kii ab tak maut ho chuki he
 Now this number is also expected to increase
 tippaniyan On the other hand, the Forest Department says that many lions were removed from sensitive areas to safe places before the monsoon
 van vibhaag kaa kahana he ki phir bhi itane sheron kii maut chintaa kii baat he or sthaneey logon se milakar abhi or sheron kii talash kii ja rahi he or jarurat padane par unhen surakshit sthanon par le jaaya jayega
 Everyone feels that just as modern technology is used in the counting of lions, in the same way modern technology should be used to protect them even during natural calamities, so that this valuable heritage can be saved in time

 is baar jab baadh ai to shethrunji nadi kaa pani is ilaake main bhi fail gaya
 Now the water has landed, people have seen the bodies of lions in many places

 Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday praised Congress leader Sonia Gandhi and party president Rahul Gandhi
 unhone kaha ki logon ko garv hona chahie ki purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi kii nrushans hatya ke baavjood un logon ne garibon kii seva jari rakhi
 Pawar (sharad Pawar) in the meantime attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi (PM Modi) for accusing the Gandhi family of ruining the country and said that he had nothing when innocent people were being killed in Gujarat as their chief minister

 purv kendriya mantri (sharad Pawar) ne apane bhaashan main gujarat ke kisi khaas maamle kaa zikr nahin kiya lekin unhone 2002 ke gujarat dangon kaa hawala diya
 The NCP leader was speaking at an event in Satara district, 300 km from here
 dhyaan ho ki yah koi pehla mauka nahin he jab sharad pavaar ne piem modi par hamalaa bolaa ho
 Earlier, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar had said that Modi should be ashamed about the allegation made by PM Narendra Modi on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during the campaign for Gujarat assembly elections
 pavaar ne yah bhi kaha tha ki piem modi ne desh ko tabah kar diya he or pradhanmantri pad kii garima kam kii he
 Significantly, during the election campaign, PM Modi had indicated that Pakistan is trying to influence the Gujarat elections
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki manishankar ayyar ke unke khilaaf 'neech' tippanee karne se ek din pehle kuch pakistani adhikariyon or purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne mulaakaat kii thi
 In response to this statement of PM Modi, Manmohan Singh gave a befitting reply, saying that Modi has become dazed by the possibility of defeat in Gujarat elections
 manmohan singh ne yah maang bhi kii thi ki piem modi is bayaan ke liye desh se maafee maangen
 Criticizing PM Modi's statement, Sharad Pawar had said that the Prime Minister should be ashamed while making such allegations
 aapane is desh ke purv pradhanmantri (manmohan singh) or purv raksha adhikariyon ke khilaaf aarope lagaae
 He had said that the Modi government did not solve the problems of farmers and other issues facing the country, but he is bringing the angle of Pakistan as a way of diverting attention during the Gujarat elections

 It is said that during worship, the bell must be played
 aisa maananaa he ki isse ishwar jaagate hai or aapaki prarthana sunate hai
 But we are telling you here that the ringing of a bell is not only a connection to God, but it also has a scientific effect
 yahi vajah he ki ghanti hameshaa mandir ke pravesh sthaan par lagaai jaati he
 If you are not getting the desired job, then according to the zodiac, do these measures
 The scientific reason behind playing the bell is of the house or of any religious place
 vahaan ghanti to hoti hi he
 There are religious reasons behind this as well as it has a scientific effect on our lives
 vaigyanikon kaa kahana he ki jab ghanti bajaai jaati he to vaataavaran main kampan paidaa hota he, jo vayumandal ke kaaran kaaphi dur tak jaataa he
 The advantage of this vibration is that all the bacteria, viruses and micro-organisms that come in its area are destroyed, which purifies the surrounding environment
 yahi kaaran he ki jin jagahon par ghanti bajane kii aawaaj niyamit aati rahati he, vahaan kaa vaataavaran hameshaa shuddh or pavitra bana rahata he
 For this reason, people also put wind chimes on their doors and windows, so that the negative powers are removed from its sound

 The mind feels peace by connecting with the rhythm of the bell
 mandir main ghanti bajaane se maanav ke kai janmon ke paap tak nasht ho jate hai
 In the morning and evening, whenever there is worship or aarti in the temple, bells are played with a rhythm and special tune, so that the people present there feel peace and divine presence
 jarur jaayen mumbai sthit shri siddhivinayak mandir- jab sristi kaa prarambh hua, tab jo naad (aawaaj) gunji thi
 The same sound comes even when the bell rings
 ghanti usee naad kaa pratik he
 The same sound is also awakened by the pronunciation of 'omkar'
 kahin-kahin yah bhi likhit he ki jab pralay aayega us samay bhi aisa hi naad guunjega
 The bell or hour outside the temple has also been considered a symbol of time

 railway bhartee board (RRB) ne aane vaale samay main antipisi (RRB NTPC) ke hajaaron padon par bhartee pariksha yojit karegaa
 a notice regarding RRB NTPC (RRB NTPC 2019) is going viral on social media

 The officer told NDTV Khabar, "this notice is fake, the Railways has not taken any decision like reducing the vacancy
" saath hi pariksha railway bhartee board hi karaayega na ki IRCTC
 "it makes it clear that the Railways is neither reducing the number of posts nor the IRCTC is going to conduct this exam
 haal hi main jo notice railway ne jari kiya he wo antipisi bhartee pariksha ko sthagit karne ke sambandh main he
 Both real and fake notices are given below
 saaf he ki ek baar phir railway main ho rahi bhartiyon ko lekar afvaah failaai ja rahi he
 As far as this notice which looks like official notice is concerned, this kind of tampering with the notice has been done earlier
 bataa den ki isse pehle RRB JE exam date kaa farji notice viral hua tha

 After the defeat in the Lok Sabha elections, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav is saying that he did not understand the fight
 lekin 2012 ke baad se vah lagaataar jis tarah paariwarik or siyaasi rishton ko samaj paane main naakaam ho rahe hai, usase sawaal uthta he ki kya vah sachumuch ladaai ko samaj nahin paa rahe hai?akhilesh yadav bhale hi gathbandhan ke rishte ko atoot bataate rahe hon, lekin unke saajhedaar mauka aate hi alag raah chun le rahe hai
 This is the hallmark of what Mayawati is signaling after the election defeat
 philhal in bevafaaiyon ko silsilewar dekhen to tasviir saaf hoti hui dikhegi
 One must remember the time of 2012 when Akhilesh Yadav managed to win the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections due to his strategy
 isamen actbur 2011 main puure pradesh main unki cycle yatra kaa bada yogadan mana jaataa he
 During that time, the famous tag line of his campaign 'asha Ki Cycle' led practically Akhilesh Yadav to the chair of Chief Minister
 magar mukhyamantri banane ke baad raajnneetik galiyaaron se lekar ghar kii deevaaron ke bich paariwarik rishte bhi darkane lage
 The plot of the story of separation of people close to Akhilesh Yadav was not ready in a day
 sambhawatah iskaa becoground usee din taiyaar ho gaya tha, jab amar singh ne 2007 main mayawati se vidhansabha chunaav main mili karaari shikast ke baad akhilesh yadav ko samaajawaadee party kii kaman saunpane kii mulaayam singh yadav ko salaah di thi
 Mulayam Singh too, after winning the assembly elections in 2012, preferred son instead of his brother Shivpal Yadav, who was dreaming of the Chief Minister's post, and Akhilesh Yadav became CM
 2017 tak aate-aate parivaar main daraar kaa dayera kaaphi bad chukaa tha or isamen mulaayam singh yadav or shivpal yadav bhi akhilesh ke khilaaf khadey mili
 During that time, the political drama that took care of family and political heritage has become history
 idhar 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main badi jeet hasil kar narendra modi pradhanmantri ban chuke the or mana gaya ki 2017 main uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main modi lahar chalegi
 Seeing this apprehension, Akhilesh Yadav decided to tie up with the Congress in the 2017 assembly elections, but out of a total of 403 seats, he lost 356 seats, and the Congress was part of the way
 yah ek jhatka bhi or ek sabak bhi
 Encouraged by the victory in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections with the support of the BSP, Akhilesh Yadav decided to contest in an alliance with Mayawati's party for the Lok Sabha elections 2019
 lekin isamen akhilesh kii party pichley loksabhaa chunaav kaa apana record bhi doharaa nahin pai jabaki basapa ko 10 siton par jeet mili
 Now, when the churning is going on with the election results, Mayawati is indicating to take a different route
 unhone vidhansabha kii 11 siton par hone vaale upachunaav main utarane kaa elaan kiya he jabaki basapa isse pehle upachunaav nahin ladati rahi he
 It is said about Mayawati that she believes in moving her bets forward
 sambhawatah vidhansabha kii khaali ho rahi sabhi 11 siton ke upachunaav ladane kaa elaan kar unhone yahi sabit kiya he
 But in the manner in which Akhilesh Yadav could not understand the atmosphere in the Lok Sabha elections, he is lagging behind in understanding political relations
 isiilie kaha ja rahaa he ki uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri banane ke baad se unhen sirf bevafaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 Civil rights activist and writer Ram Puniyani has received threatening calls
 guuruuvaar-shuukravaar kii raat unke ghar par phone kar unhen dhamkee di gai ki ve sampradayik sauhardra ko badhaava dene vaale kaam karnaa band kar den
 In this connection, Ram Puniyani has lodged an FIR with the police
 puniyaani iaiti ke professor rahe hai or sampradayik sauhaard ko lekar kiye jane vaale apane kaamon ke liye vah jane jate hai
 He keeps giving social media, youtube videos and lectures for communal harmony
 maamla aapraadhik dhamkee kii dhaaraon ke tahat darj kiya gaya he
 According to the complaint, Puniyani received calls from different numbers on her landline phone on Thursday night
 pehle phone karne vaale ne puniyaani ke saath gaali galouj kii
 The caller also said that they should stop anti-hindutva activities
 phone karne vaale 15 main apana ghar chhodane kii dhamkee di
 Threatened to bear the consequences
 paanch minute baad phir doosraa phone aayaa jise ram puniyaani ne risive kiya
 This time too, he was called bad in a threatening tone
 phone karne vaale ne poocha ki kya vah ram puniyaani se hi baat kar rahaa he
 When Puniyani denied it, she hung up
 phone karne vaale kaa number abhi pahachaanaa nahin ja sakaa he
 Ram Puniyani said, it is a very disturbing matter
 mere parivara ko meri suraksha kii chintaa he
 Hopefully the administration will take it seriously
 yah pehla mauka nahin he jab aisa hua he
 In this connection, Professor Ram Puniyani has written to the Mumbai Police Commissioner and has demanded action
 ram puniyaani ne yah bhi bataaya ki is saal march main unke ghar par passport inkavari ke naam par aae the jabaki unhone passport ke applai bhi nahin kiya tha
 They believe that the strings of the two events are interlinked somewhere

 jila prashasan ko isaki bhanak tak nahin lagi
 The case was revealed when the wife of that fake MLA went to the circuit house in search of him
 lekin tab tak farji vidhayak apni premika ke saath faraar ho chukaa tha
 It is said that a spice trader named Amarendra Kumar Singh, resident of Dhurwa, Ranchi, capital of Jharkhand, called the OSD of the District Magistrate of Bhojpur on December 14 and became an MLA and booked a room in the circuit house
 16 disambar ko vah farji vidhayak ek apahrit yuvati ko apana patni bataa kar aara sthit circuit house pahunchaa
 According to the information, he stayed in different rooms with the woman for 7 days and celebrated the recitations
 is baat kaa raaj tab khulaa, jab 31 disambar ko farji emele amrendra kii patni shalini devi ne vahaan pahunchakar bataaya ki vah amrendra kumaar singh kii patni he
 He called Amarendra a fake MLA and said that he is neither a former MLA nor any public representative
 shalini ke anusaar amrendra mul rup se jaiprakash nagar, patna kaa nivasee he
 Previously he lived in Jagarnathpur, Dhurwa, Ranchi
 uske pita vidhansabha main job karte the

 unki ek beti bhi he, jiskaa naam archi prarthana he
 She is seven years old
 mahila kii shikaayat par navada thane kii police jaanch ke liye circuit house pahunchi
 But by then Amarendra had left the place and escaped with the woman from there
 farji vidhayak kii patni shalini ne bataaya ki jis yuvati ke saath farji vidhayak banakar amrendra circuit house main mouj-masti kar rahaa tha, vah pashchim bengal ke asanasol kii rahane vaali he
 a case of kidnapping of the woman was registered on 6 November at a police station in Asansol
 is ghatana ke baad us yuvati ke parijan lagaataar shalini ko kol kar rahe hai
 Due to which Shalini got upset
 tab usne apane pati se sampark kiya or usase milane aara chali ai, lekin is baar bhi uskaa pati use chakma dekar faraar ho gaya
 On this matter, former MLA and RJD state general secretary Bijendra Yadav said that if this happens, terrorists can also come to Ara's circuit house and stay comfortable
 vahiin care tekar raju se baat kii gai to uskaa kahana tha ki variya adhikari ke aadeshaanusaar cameraa aavantit kiya gaya tha
 No one came to know that he is a fake MLA
 philhal is maamle main navada thane main maamla darj karne ke liye aavedan diya gaya he

 Farmers unhappy due to crop failure are so desperate and helpless with increasing debt that suicide seems to be the easy path for them
 vaise thik-thik sankhya bataa paanaa mushkil he, par 2 june, 2014 ko is rajya ke gathan ke baad se ab tak yahaan 409 kisaanon kii aatmahatya kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 Telangana Agriculture Minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy has also recently admitted that at least one farmer commits suicide every day
 enjio or kisaan sanghathanon kii maane to aatmahatya karne vaale kisaanon kii sankhya isaki kam se kam teen guna he
 This is not the first time that the entire southern plateau, from Marathwada in Maharashtra to Telangana and parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, has lost crop due to terrible drought and farmers have committed suicide due to mounting debt
 marathavada ilaake ko lagaataar chauthi baar sookhe kii maar jhelni pad rahi he
 Beed district alone recorded more than 105 suicides in August
 vahiin telugana or andhra pradesh main lagaataar duusare saal sookhaa padaa he
 In Madak, Ranga Reddy, Adilabad, Khammam, Warangal and Mehboob Nagar districts of Telangana, there have been cases of farmer suicides due to money crunch
 dakshin-pashchim monsoon ke dhokhaa dene se sookhe ke sanket saaf dikhaai de rahe hai
 The central government is claiming to be fully prepared to deal with the possibility of a drought due to a weak monsoon
 kendriya krishi mantri radhamohan singh india today se kehete hai, ‚Äúmaine 9 sitambar ko sabhi vibhaagon or sambandhit mantralayon kii baithak lee he
 i want to assure that we are fully prepared to deal with the possibility of drought
 hamaari taiyaariyon ne pichley varsh bhi achche parinaam die the
 This year also the preparations of the Central Government have been made in such a way that the effects of the drought can be minimized with the cooperation of the states
 ‚Äù unhone maharashtra ke krishi mantri se baat kar marathavada or madhya maharashtra kii sthiti kii jaankaree lee
 Apart from this, the Minister of State for Agriculture and officials have also been instructed to visit the affected areas
 modi sarkaar ne sookhe se nibatane ke liye darjan bhar kadam uthaae hai jinamein prabhavit pariwaron ko manaregaa main atirikt kaary diwas dena, kisaanon ko dijal, beej par sabsidi, atirikt chaara vikaas kaarykram, 600 jilon ke liye aakasmik fasal yojana or kharif 2015 ke liye bijon or anya sansadhano kii uplabdhta ke saath aapadaa nidhi kii pehali kist jari karnaa
 While these steps have severely affected farmers' livelihoods in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, apart from these steps, sowing has also been affected by lack of water for irrigation schemes from the Krishna and Godavari rivers
 paryaapt pani na milane se krishna nadi prabandhan board ne nagarjun sagar or shrisalam sarovaron main jamaa kiye gaye krishna nadi ke puure pani ko peyajal ke liye simit rakhane kaa faisla kiya he
 This water will not be distributed for irrigation in both the states

 The banks have paid only Rs 6,631 crore to 15 lakh farmers till 1 September

 The target was to provide a loan of Rs

 He asked, "how will you accomplish this goal?" mujhe janata ko jawaab dena hota he

 ‚Äùmaharashtra ke shaayad sabase zyada prabhavit ilaake marathavada ke bid main lagaataar chauthe saal sookhaa padane se sankat or bad gaya he
 Around 2

 marathavada main, jisamen aurangabad, nanded, latur, parbhani, jaalnaa, bid, hingoli or osmanabad aate hai, sitambar ke pehle hafte main sirf 240 mimi barish hui
 Generally it rains 719 mm
 is ilaake main kareeb 70 chini mili hai, jisase sthiti or kharaab hui he
 a lot of water is used in these mills
 is saal farvari main maharashtra sarkaar ne kaha ki kareeb 90 lakh kisaanon ko sookhe kii maar jhelni padi he
 The state government is planning to provide several benefits and concessions to provide relief to the farmers
 isamen kaksha 12 tak ke chaatr-chaatraon ke liye fees maaf karnaa shaamil he
 Also the government annually

 5 lakh ru
 Is considering to bear half the fees of children of farmers with income upto Rs

 itnaa hi nahin, panchayat samitiyon ko nirdesh diya gaya he ki ve centre or rajya sarkaar kii rojgaar guarantee kii yojanaon ke tahat logon ko kaam muhaiyaa karaaen
 Consultant of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association p
 chengal reddy kehete hai, ‚Äúcentre or rajya sarkaron ne karj maaf karne or jaruri saamaan kii keemton par asthaayee taur par niyantran karne jaise fori upaae apanaae hai
 But farmers really need to take concrete steps for growth, not healer measures
 ‚Äùis bich monsoon kii jaankaree ke taaja vishleshan se pataa chalata he ki sitambar ke aakhir main jab yah khatm ho jayega to kul barish saamaanya se 10 fisadi kam rahegi jisase kharif or rabi, donon hi fasalon ko nuksaan hoga, kyonki 91 bade jalaashyon main pani kaa str gir gaya he or jaldi hi yah giravat bad jaaegi
 Despite the deficient rains in early September, the area of sowing has increased across the country
 jo 967
 Has reached 8 crore hectares as compared to 965 last year
 9 karod hectare hi tha
 It is evident that such contradictory situation arises due to farmers not getting adequate advice about agriculture
 kapaas or jute ko chhodkar garmi kii sabhi fasalon kaa rakabaa zyada tha lekin kamjor ankuran or paudhon ko dekhte hue paidaavaar kam hone kii ummid he
 Less frequent occurrences of drought occur one after another

 But surely today you are 74 years old, which is not comparable to being 100 days old
 is khat main karti chidambaram ne modi sarkaar ke 100 din ke kaarykaal par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa he
 It is worth noting that a few days ago, the Rouse Avenue Court of Delhi rejected Chidambaram's petition to surrender to the ED
 chidambaram ne 5 sitambar ko court main ED kii saamne sarender karne kii yachika daayar kii thi
 Responding to the court notice on Thursday, the ED refused to take Chidambaram into custody
 pi chidambaram INX media maamle main sibiai cese main 19 sitambar tak nyaayik hiraasat main tihaad jail main band hai
 Let us tell you that the petition was surrendered on Thursday in front of the ED of Congress leader and former Union Minister p Chidambaram in Delhi's Rouse Avenue Court
 ienex media bhrashtachar maamle main gat 5 sitambar ko rouz avenue court ne pravartan nideshaalay (ED) ko notice jari kar jawaab daakhil karne ke liye kaha tha
 The court reserved its decision in this case
 court main aaj idi ne chidambaram kii sarender yachika kaa virodh kiya tha
 On behalf of Chidambaram, his lawyer Kapil Sibal asked why the ED reached to arrest him on August 20 and 21 when the ED did not want to arrest Chidambaram
 On behalf of the Enforcement Directorate, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that ED is examining many documents
 chah logon ko bulaakar poochtacha kii ja chuki he
 Inquiries from three people are still going on
 unhone kaha tha ki chidambaram ko giraftaar karne se pehle ham apni puri taiyaari kar lenaa chaahate hai
 At the moment we do not want to arrest them
 ham baad main chidambaram kii giraftaar karenge taaki ham puri taiyaari ke saath unase poochtacha kar saken
 Mehta had said that the 15 days of our custody will start only after we finish questioning six people
 ab poochtacha main do din bhi lag sakate hai, chaar din bhi lag sakate hai
 We have been questioning since September 6
 unhone kaha tha ki chidambaram abhi nyaayik hiraasat main hai isliye sabooton se koi chhedchhad nahin kar sakate
 Chidambaram cannot even influence the witnesses, so we are interrogating the witnesses
 unke nyaayik hiraasat main rahete hue hi ham zyaada se zyaada poochtacha kar sakate hai
 Chidambaram's lawyer Kapil Sibal had said that the ED was very keen at first to arrest Chidambaram
 idi to chidambaram ko giraftaar karne 21 agast ko unke ghar bhi gai thi
 On the 20th too, he came outside Chidambaram's house with a notice
 idi ne supreme court or hai court donon main hi kaha ki vah chidambaram ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha karnaa chahta he
 Sibal had said that he wants Chidambaram to be kept in judicial custody as much as possible
 phir hiraasat main len or phir chidambaram ko nyaayik hiraasat main bhej den
 Now they are making excuses for questioning six people
 ye chidambaram ko taqaliif pahunchane ke liye aisa kar rahe hai
 He had said that Chidambaram would like to cooperate in the investigation
 ham to kah rahe hai ki aap hamen hiraasat main lijie
 If you did not have to inquire, why did you come to arrest Chidambaram on 20 and 21 August? The accused has the right to surrender in court
 chidambaram ne to court main khud aakar kaha ki main sarender karnaa chahta hum
 The ED had said that Chidambaram was in police custody till 5 September
 phir 15 din kii nyaayik hiraasat main hai
 We are a separate agency
 ham PMLA ke tahat jaanch kar rahe hai
 In this way, every accused will surrender and ask that the agency take me into custody
 court tay kar saktaa he, unhen 15 din kii hiraasat me bhej saktaa he
 So far we have not filed the charge sheet in this entire case
 court ne is bahes ke baad chidambaram kii sarender karne kii yachika par apana aadesh surakshit kar liya or aaj chidambaram kii yachika ko khaarij kar diya

 If there is an outstanding, the bank guarantee of the states will be redeemed
 yahaan tak ki centre sarkaar rajyon ko bijli bakaae chukaane ke liye karj lene se bhi rokane vaali he
 According to John Maynard Kenge's decades-old Mantar, during a recession, governments should increase spending, leaving concerns of deficits

 But the latest data that we have received from the budgets of the Center and the states, says that it may take a long time to recover from this recession

 Two cases against Raj are to be heard today
 ek maamle kii sunwaayee ranchi hoicourt main or doosraa patna kii sijeem adaalat main honi he
 The matter is important because if the verdict comes against Raj Thackeray in both the cases, then he can get caught in a legal trap
 jharkhand hoicourt raaj thakare kii us yachika par sunwaayee karegaa jisamen unhone jamshedpur main unke khilaaf darj ek maamle ko mumbai sthanantarit karne kii apil kii he

 gauratlab he ki jharkhand main raaj thakare ke khilaaf kul chah maamle darj hai jisamen teen jamshedpur, ek dhanbad, ek jamtada, auki ek gadwa main darj karaae gaye hai
 If they get relief in the Jamshedpur case from the Jharkhand High Court, then the way will be easy for them in other cases as well
 lekin agar hoicourt ne apil radd kar di to mumkin he ki aane vaale dinon main jharkhand kii alag-alag adaalaton ke chakkar katate -katate unke hosh phakhta ho jaaen

 The court has been allowed to initiate a criminal case against Raj Thackeray and his party leader Shirish Parkar

 When his efforts were not successful, this 20-year-old player decided to change the state to Punjab this year

 Russia, while declaring it a threat to the world war, issued an order to prepare its military
 uttar korea se lagane vaali sarhad par tainaat kar diya he
 However, given the seriousness of this matter, Russia is neither taking any side but is making a lot of noise
 magar rus main ho rahi is halchal ek baat to saaf kar di he ki ab maamla sanjeeda ho chukaa he
 This was bound to happen, the way Trump and Kim Jong were eating and making statements against each other, the situation was bound to happen and now it has come
 lihaaza jang ke halaat main sirf korea america or japan hi apni qamar nahin kasenge balki rus ne bhi apane hathiyaaron ko painaa karnaa shuru kar diya he
 In Russia, these preparations have been initiated in several stages and it has been disclosed by the head of the Security Council of Russia itself
 ye to khayr pehle se tay tha ki agar jang ke halaat bane to ye jang sirf uttar korea or dakshin korea yaa america ke bich nahin balki isamen japan, china or rus ko bhi shaamil hona padegaa
 On the one hand there is North Korea who are happy to do missile test on continuous missile and on the other side it is America which along with South Korea is trying to show their strength to Kim Jong Un by drilling the military
 magar in sab ke bich kisi ko ye parvaah nahin ki agar jang hui to ye parmaanu yuddh main tabdeel ho jaaegi jisaki tabaahi kaa andaaza lagaana mushkil he
 The other big thing is that due to this war the other superpowers of the world cannot remain untouched and now its effect is also seen in the neighboring countries
 agar ye zubaani jang vaaki jang main tabdeel hoti he to hamen isse bachane ke liye upaay khojane honge
 Also, preparations have to be made to deal with it
 haalanki ham lagaataar kehete aa rahe hai yuddh kisi bhi samasya kaa hal nahin he
 It is important that we try to avoid it
 magar chunki halaat kharaab lag rahe hai lihaaza nishchit taur par hamen uttar korea kii sarhad se lagane vaale apane ilaakon ko surakshit karnaa hoga
 The world is very concerned about this war
 isaki jhalak korian seemaa se lage rus jaise mulk main uthaae ja rahe kadamon ko dekh kar kii ja sakati he
 Russia's President Bladmyr Putin then took his fast 15,000 soldiers to his 17 km of North Korea
 kii sarhad par tainaat kar die hai, taaki newclear war yani parmaanu yuddh kii surat main log uttar korea se visthapiton kii surat main rus main ghusane naa paaen
 However, Russia, Trump and Kim Jong are well aware of their moods, so are stepping up
 lekin ek sach ye bhi he ki donon mulk ke darmiyaan agar koi yuddh taal saktaa he to wo rus hi he
 Where Russia has deployed its military troops on the border of North Korea
 vahiin china bhi kahaan peeche rahane vaala tha
 China has also increased the deployment of thousands of troops on its border with North Korea, so that any incoming threats can be dealt with
 rus ke saath-saath china ko bhi lagata he ki agaruttar korea par trump bada hamalabolate hai to kahin uskaa asar sarhad paar uske mulkon par naa ho
 So diplomatically both these countries are neither standing with North Korea nor with America
 lekin magar america ke liye mushkil ye he ki wo in donon deshon ko bharose main liye bina agar karrwai karata he to donon desh uttar korea ke saath bhi khadey ho sakate hai

 The program was held in Mumbai on Monday to mark the 51st anniversary of the song
 kaarykram main shaheedon ko shradhanjali ke saath hi sur samraji lata mangeshkar kaa bhi sammaan kiya gaya
 But the real color in the program was filled when Lata ji again immortalized the antara of this song on the request of Narendra Modi on stage
 rescorse ground main yojit is kaarykram main narendra modi ke mukhya atithi hone kii vajah se siyaasi sawaal bhi uthe
 But the chorus of this song overshadowed every color
 lata mangeshkar ne 27 janvari 1963 main dilli ke neshnal stadium main pehali baar jab yah geet gaya tha tab sabhi kii ankhen nam ho gai thim
 After 51 years, when 85-year-old Lataji sang Antara in Mumbai even today, the throat of millions of people was surely strangled
 
 
 
 And with this song opened, the memory of Lata ji also remembered the story when the then Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru started crying after listening to the song 51 years ago
 neshnal stadium kaa wo har manjar lata ji kii jubaan main khulata chalaa gaya
 How to wake up this song
 kaise kavi pradeep ne is geet kaa taana-bana buna tha
 For years, there was a stubborn request for this song from the audience
 tab nehru ab modi or kavi pradipaj se 51 saal pehle jab lata ji ne yah geet gaya tab manch par jawahar laal nehru the, desh ke pehle pradhanmantri or aaj naredra modi, jo bijepi ke piem pad ke ummidavaar hai
 Nationalism has changed in 51 years with these two faces
 rashtrawaad kii paribhaasha par aaj siyaasi vichaardhaaraein ek duusare kii virdohi banakar khadi ho jaati hai, uske nirvivaad pratik banakar ubhare the kavi pradeep
 He was famous as a Hindi poet since the 30s
 kavi sammelnon or mushaairon main unki alag dhak jamaa karti thi
 Impressed by his poetry and stage delivery, Mahakavi Nirala gave a 4-page article
 samay aage badha, 40 ke dashak main jab pradeep ne filmon kaa rukh kiya to unki aalochana hui
 But here he continued to compose songs in his own style
 urdu shaayaron kii bich aise hindi geetkaar ke rup main ubhare jo na sirf premugit likh saktaa tha balki desh bhakthi se labarej geeton ke bol bhi buland karata tha
 After writing the song manabharat-china Jung was defeated in 1963, when the opportunity to write another patriotic song came, the despotic poet first refused
 iske peeche shakeel badayuni kaa likhaa geet 'apni aazaadee ko ham haragij mitaa sakate nahin' tha
 No better song could be written in the eyes of poet Pradeep
 jang main haar pradeep ke seene main nahin khatak rahi thi balki us daur main maayusi itani haaavee thi ki kavitaai bhala kya soojhati
 But where were directors like Mehboob Khan to believe this
 shaheedon ke liye kuch nayaa likhane kii jid liye ek din to wo pradeep ke ghar hi pahunch gaye
 As soon as Mehboob Khan left, the poet's mind got ready with his tune and pen
 pradeep kai din geet likhane ke liye jujhate rahe
 That day he was walking on the shore of the sea, when a thought flashed in the mind
 khyaal ye ki desh ke aage un javaanon ke liye koi jati, dharm yaa samudaay nahin
 At the forefront is Watan
 cigarette ke raper par likhaa gitkavi pradeep ko gaanaa to sujh gaya, lekin likhane ke liye tab unke paas kaagaj kaa tukdaa nahin tha
 In such a situation, he took out a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and a rapper with a silver work inside it and wrote this song on him
 yah geet 27 janvari 1963 ko wo geet dilli ke neshnal stedim main lata ji ke suron main gunj rahaa tha
 The lyrics were falling from the eyes of Nehru ji
 lekin wo aitihaasik pal dekhne ke liye kavi pradeep maujuud nahin the
 According to poet Pradip's daughter Mitul Padrip, his father was not invited to participate in the program
 lata ji ne vaise to hajaaron geet gaae, lekin yah geet sunakar unki ankhe aaj bhi bhar aati he
 She considers it her favorite and most effective song

 Researchers found that the number of tumors on the side where the phone was talked was more
 baharhaal, visheshgyon ne yah chetavanee di ki mobile phone se honevaala khatre or bade ho sakate hai kyonki adhyayan main baaki kai chizon kii vyakhya nahin kii gai he
 For example, it did not pay attention to the type of tumor that is inside the ear
 mast senity abhiyaan samooh kii pravaktaa sara rhite ne kaha ki ve sirf do tarah ke tumor ko dekh rahe hai
 In other types of reports, this risk has been doubled, but this study of interphones has increased the risk by 40 percent
 saakshyon se yah pataa chalaa ki pahchaan hone vaale logon kii sankhya har saal do pratishat kii dar se bad rahi thi
 Dr

 sarkaar ko chahie kii vah mobile phone ke packeton par chetavanee jari kare or duusare deshon kii tarah bacchon ko lekar satarkta barte
 Blackwell said that the parents did not realize this danger
 yah khatra brain tumor se aage bhi ja saktaa he
 The government should warn the parents because productive companies will not do it
