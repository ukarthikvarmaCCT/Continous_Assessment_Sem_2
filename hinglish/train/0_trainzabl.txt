 log in to madhya pradesh ke chhatarpur jile ke harpalpur main adhikariyon kii laaparvaahee ke chalate hajaaron quintal pyaaj ke sadane se faili badboo ne logon kaa jeena muhaal kar diya he
 a consignment of 18,000 quintal onions was brought from the goods train to Harpalpur railway station
 ise rack point par utaar kar khule main rakh diya gaya
 Meanwhile, onion started rotting and stinking due to rain
 logon ne shikaayat kii to prashasan harakat main aayaa
 Attempts were made to send some onions to distribution centers, but where would buyers get the rotting onions
 prashasan ne thekedaar ke madhyam sepyajko gaddha khodakar nasht karana shuru kiya
 Where this is being done, a school is located nearby
 tej badboo hone kii vajah se bacchon ne skool aana band kar diya he
 School management says that parents are not sending children to school for fear of illness
 skool prabandhan ne tehseeldaar jiya fatima se is puure maamle kii shikaayat kii
 The school children and their parents say that when the contractor was asked to remove the interest, he said that let the onion lie for a few days and then it will be removed
 tehseeldaar jiya fatima ne is maamle par sakht rukh apanaate hue thekedaar ko tatkaal pyaaj hataane ke aadesh die
 This case questions the entire system of government procurement of agricultural products
 isse pataa chalata he ki kis tarah sarkari paise kii barbaadi hoti he
 The money was first spent on the purchase of onions
 lekin ye nahin dekha gaya ki pyaaj ko barish ke mausam main sahi tareeke se store nahin kiya gaya to wo sad jaaegi
 If interest falls now, money will also be spent to establish it
 sthaneey logon ko beemaari kaa khatra alag se
 Also, the loss of education of school children separately
 lekin in sawaalon kaa jawaab kiske paas he, sarkari system apane hisaab se hi chalata he

 He is the Chief Minister, all the arrangements and frills are his own
 unke saath satyendra jain ji jaise arbapati log hai
 How do i cut my hand and give it to them? jaanch hone do, doodh kaa doodh or pani kaa pani ho jayega
 The second case i mentioned, all the details about Arvind ji's relatives are in front of the country
 kaise galat tareekon se arvind kejariwal ji ke rishtedaaron ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya wo bhi ab khul chukaa he
 The third case relates to foreign visits
 apane dil par haath rakhkar bataao, in videsh yatraaon kii jaankaree saarvajanik nahin honi chahie
 After all, what is there to hide? i just want to say that there is a lot of black hidden in the details of these foreign trips, to prevent you and everyone being made a pawn

 Perhaps it will help you understand the truth
 tumhen mere kaaran anshan karnaa pad rahaa he uske liye maaf karnaa
 One day the truth will be revealed to everyone

 sachin bansal kii aawaaj main aajkal nai bulandi aa gai he
 In terms of earnings, the voice of the CEO of India's largest online retailer Flipkart gets very excited that he is looking for talent in the world to take his dream to a new level
 america main google, linkdin or twitor jaise takneekee leaderon se idia exange karne ke baad swadesh lautne ke 12 ghante ke bheetar 32 saal ke sachin kaa kahana tha, ''hamen jo bhi acha aadmi mil jaae, use bhartee kar lenge
 We are increasing the number of technical people
 sirf bharat hi nahin baahar se bhi logon ko laa rahe hai
 "while Sachin may deny the us's interference, the enthusiasm at Flipkart's headquarters in Bangalore is directly linked to Amazon's entry into India last June, the world's largest online retailer
" niyamon se bandhe hone ke kaaran amejan bharat main sidhe koi retail seva nahin de rahaa, lekin uskaa sandesh saaf he ki online retail kaa baap aa gaya he
 Amazon India office is just 13 km from Flipkart in Bangalore
 kareeb do dashak ke anubhav or baari jeb ke bal par jeff bejoj kii company amejan flipcart ko tagdi takkar de sakati he
 It is also true that if the competition is a collision, miracles can happen in a company like Flipkart
 amejan
 a month before the market opened in India by these names, Flipkart opened its market
 july main usne pejipi naam se online bhugtan kar saral or surakshit vikalp dene kaa elaan kiya tha
 Flipkart deals with around one lakh a day, so the company is confident that it will make profits on this force
 donon companiyaan ek jaisi sevaayen de rahi hai
 Nevertheless, Bansal denies any collision with Amazon
 sachin kii maane to unki najar main ''yah muqabla acha he
 Things are getting more interesting
 ham compitishan par dhyaan nahin dete ham to vaise bhi kaarobaar badhaane par tule hai
 Sachin's concern is that much less work is being done than what he has to do by 2020
 sachin risellers kii sankhya maujuuda 1,000 se badhaakar ek saal main 10,000 se 15,000 tak kar lenaa chaahate hai
 He says, "we have learned a lot in the last eight months about the type of technology needed to grow the business with the eco system
 hamen lagata he, aadhe se zyada bijness third party vikreta se aayega
 "flipkart wants to increase its presence in fashion and readymade garments, as they have an average margin of 20 to 30 percent margin
 iske vipareet electronics jaisi shreniyon main margin isse aadhe se bhi kam he or shipment kaa kiraaya bhi nahin nikalataa
 Fashion online vendors are more visited on the site
 technopac ke adhyaksh arvind singhl kaa kahana he, ''loylty bonus dene yaa aise product dene kii niti bahut kargar hogi, jo or kahin na milte hon
 "sachin knows this and says," a good place to buy Flipkart is when you know what to buy
 agar ham logon ko kharidne ke liye prerit kar saken or unhen bataa saken ki kya khareednaa behatar hoga to hamen liye bahut bada bazaar mil saktaa he
 “the big question is how long Flipkart will continue to grow its customer base by taking losses
 sachin kehete hai, ''online shop karne vaale ek karod logon main se ab bhi bahut kam use pramukh madhyam maanate hai
 At the moment, we are encouraging customers to shop online by making them happy
 ”flipcart ke samarthak bhi uske ghate kii parvaah nahin kar rahe hai
 Abhishek Aggarwal, Seattle-based managing director of Vulcan Capital, a company that funds Flipkart, says, "amazon has not lost any local company in any BRIC (brazil, Russia, India and China) country, whether it is the Russian giant Ozone
" Or Alibaba in China
 bharat main sthiti badali to mujhe aashcharya hoga
 Singhal of Technopac says, "there will be five to six major companies in India, including Amazon
" ”sachin nakadi ke maamle main har chintaa se inkaar karte hai
 He says that the focus of Flipkart is to increase the customer and brand
 unka kahana he ki flipcart aisi company honi chahie, jisase saamaan kharidne kii sifarish aap apni maa se kar saken or nishcint ho saken ki anubhav bura nahin rahegaa
 Amazon in kadam jamaa rahi he or flipcart ke liye jaldi hi karo yaa maro kaa vakt aane vaala he
 If you are absolutely careful about teeth and are trying remedies like mouthwash, then be careful
 kahin aisa to nahin he ki jin upayon ko aap daanton ke liye acha samaj rahe hai wo aapako nuksaan pahunchaa rahe hon
 Let me tell you that it is not wise to use mouthwash for cleaning teeth and bad mouth
 din main kai baar mouthwash se garaara karne par daanton main peelaapan or munh main dryness jaisi samasyaon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Medicin Head Doctor SP Biotra of Sir Gangaram Hospital believes that good brushing is enough for daily cleaning of teeth
 dilli kii ek dentist riti mehara kaa kahana he ki jarurat naa hone par zyada samay tak mouthwash kaa istemaal kiya jaae to iskaa ulta asar dikh saktaa he
 Research has proved that mouthwash or any chewing gum is not required in 80 percent of cases
 munh se durgandh aane kaa mukhya kaaran he bacteria he jo aapaki jeebh main hota he or isko rojaanaa saaf karnaa behad jaruri he
 Apart from this, food particles remain in the middle of the teeth, which can be removed only by brushing them
 iske liye mouthwash kaa istemaal karnaa koi chaturaai nahin he
 Dr
 mehara ke anusaar mint spray or chuing gam aapke munh se bacteria hataane main madad nahin karte hai, ve sirf samasya ko kuch der ke liye rokkar aapako raahat de sakate hai
 Only and only brushing can clear the food particles in your teeth and gums
 daanton kii safai se jude bhrambhram- 1:kharaab brushing ke kaaran munh se durgandh aati he
 True fact: This can happen due to many reasons, including one reason is dental hygiene
 kabhi-kabhi pyaaj jaisi chije khaane se bhi ye samasya ho sakati he
 Confusion 2: Chewing sugar-free chewing gum after eating is more effective than chewing
 sahi tathy:ye aapke daanton ko saaf karne or saanson ko mahakaane main madad kar saktaa he lekin iske baad bhi aapako daanton se plak nikaalane ke liye brushing kii jarurat padegi hi
 It is beneficial for teeth whitening: It contains a lot of fiber which is a natural cleanser for teeth
 isamen kaaphi pani hota he jo sugar ko bhi kam karne main madad karata he
 Cheese: Cheese helps to increase the flow of saliva present in the mouth
 ise anti cavetti agent bhi kah sakate he
 a study has found that children who eat cheese have lower acid levels in their mouths
 gaajar:doctor ahuja kaa kahana he ki gaajar vitamin e kaa ek acha sorce he
 It helps in making tooth enamel and protects the teeth from problems like sensitivity
 doodh:american dental association kii ek study ke anusaar kuch meetha khaane ke baad ek glass doodh pine se munh main acid kaa level kam hota he
 Dr
 Mehra says that it also strengthens the teeth of growing children
 lekin doodh pine ke baad apane daanton ko pani se saaf karnaa naa bhoolen
 The e-filing website of the Income Tax Department has been fully operational and taxpayers have started filing their returns for the assessment year 2015-16
 tex departmentke ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki itiar-2 or itiar-2e ke liye links ko chaalu kar diya gaya
 The department has notified new ITR forms last week, including the three-page easy form ITR-2A
 iskar ritern kii i-filing 31 agast tak kii ja sakati he
 New Form (ITR2A) This form is for individuals or Hindu Undivided Families (hufs) who have two houses, but no income from capital gains, business / profession or foreign property / foreign income
 kaise karen apane itiar form kaa chunaavkaradaataaon ko chah prakaar ke tex form main se chunanaa hota he or apni aamadani ke strot ke aadhaar par apana sahiitiaar formpahchaanana or chunanaa hota he
 There are some other things like foreign assets, income, loss to next profit, which have to be seen before choosing your right ITR form
 agar tankhwaah, pension yaa byaaj aamadani kaa ekmaatr strot ho or sampatti ke taur par sirf ek makaan ho to aise vyakti ko itiaar-1 tex form bharna he
 Individuals and Hindu undivided families who have received income and capital gains from more than one house, need to fill in Form ITR-2
 nayaa form itiaar-2e un vyaktiyon yaa hindu avibhajit pariwaron ke liye he, jinhen koi puunjigat laabh na hua ho or jo ek se zyada makaanon ke maalik hon
 ITR-3 is for individuals / hufs earning income from business
 itiaar-4 swarozgaar main lage vyaktiyon ke liye he
 In the new passport number form, you will not have to give detailed details of your foreign travels or expenses incurred in it to the Income Tax Department
 lekin agar aapke paas passport he, to uskaa number ab bhi itiaar-2 or itiaar-2e main aapako dena hi hoga
 However, the Income Tax Department can get the details of your foreign visits from the Immigration Department
 bank khate ke byorapehale aap rifund ke makasad se sirf ek bank khate kaa byoraa dete the
 From now on you will have to provide details of all your bank accounts operated at any time during the previous year
 aapako sabhi chaalu / bachat khaaton ke number or iesces code bataane honge
 This new provision will bring transparency in the tax-fulfillment process
 itiaar-1 main badlaavane praavdhaanon ke tahat, jin logon kii bagaiyr kisi ceiling ke chhot-praapt aamadani (5,000 rupye se adhik krishi aay ke alaava) he, ve ab form itiaar-1 (sahaj) bhar sakate hai
 Similar simple measures have been offered for individuals / hufs in the context of Form-4 (sugam)
 ek or kadam yah uthaaya gaya he ki koi bhi nivasee, jo bharat ke baahar se aay arjeet kar rahaa ho yaa jiskaa bharat ke baahar koi vittiya hit ho, use itiaar-1 main inakam tex ritern daakhil karne kii ijaajat nahin he
 Filing of online returns was easy
 After filing the online return, you had to post its acknowledgment or ITR-V separately to the Income Tax Department
 ab agar aap apane itiaar form main aadhaar number de dete hai, to aapako itiaar-ve post karne kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Tax experts say this is a big relief as many people often forgot to send the acknowledgment form to the Income Tax Department

 More seats were ringing when Bhoomi Pednekar blew Akshay's flag for the toilet
 sitiyaan bajaane waalon main adhiktar purush hi the
 Till the interval there was a lot of pomp in the hall
 akshay ke dialog or bhoomi ke saath unke seens ko darshakon ne khub enjoy kiya
 After half time, these whistles and noise decreased slightly
 film main bhaashan zyada sunai dene laga

 The question of 2G spectrum allocation first came up in 2010 when the country's Accountant General and Comptroller (CAG) in a report said that the allocation of this spectrum would harm the treasury of the Central Government
 sieji report main kaha gaya ki 2ji spectrum aavanton main companiyon ko nilaamee kii bajaae pehle aao or pehle paao kii niti par spectrum diya gaya jiske chalate sarkari khajaane ko 1 lakh 76 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua

 The omission of the CBI, which led to the acquittal of all the accused, including kanimozhi-raja, caused damage to the state exchequer
 Therefore, the then Telecom Minister a Raja was accused of altering the allocation rules and benefiting some companies
 The government treasury suffered
 daawa yah bhi kiya gaya ki 2ji aavanton ke puure khel main kamishan kaa bol bala rahaa or mantralay ke saath-saath kai companiyaan is santhganth main shaamil raheen
 Therefore, the CBI, which is investigating the case, also said in its charge that A
 Raja changed the date of application for license and collected entry fees at the rate of 2001 for this allocation made in 2008, causing loss of crores to the central exchequer
 Had to lift ye padhein
 
 
 The scam was not proved in the court, this was the whole case of 2G, but the CBI said in the court that the loss of Rs

 It is not that the youth were not attracted to this employment fair
 do din main kul 15,000 logon ne panjikaran karaayaa
 Not only this, 120 companies have also set up stalls in the employment fair
 lekin rojgaar muhaiyaa karaane main na to kendriya mantri dharmendra pradhan ke daawey safal rahe or na hi meley main jutin itani companiyaan

" aise main krishi, automobile, textile or health sector main kaam karne vaale log vahaan nahi hai
 To work in Japan, Bihari youth only have to learn the Japanese language
 jald hi ham patna, chhapra sahit 2-3 jagah par japani bhashaa seekhney kaa centre kholenge
 "it is worth mentioning that Chapra is the constituency of Rajiv Pratap Rudy, who was a former Union Minister and a Minister of the Ministry of Skill Development

 har pratishthan ke lieboghshth export anivaarybihar ke shram sansaadhan mantri vijay kumaar sinha ne is avasar par bataaya ki bihar main choti badi milakar 8 lakh pratishthan panjikrut hai
 Just as it is necessary to have a pharmacist to open every drugstore, similarly it will be necessary to have GST expert for every establishment in the state
 saath hi unhone kaha ki jinako bhi rojgaar milegaa, us company main 6 maheene baad tahakikat kii jaaegi ki us vyakti kaa rojgaar kaayam he ki nahin
 Principal of Prabhat Ranjan Diagnostic and Research Center, Dr
 rupam ne bataaya ki vartmaan main bihar main medical kshetra main prashikshit karmiyon kii baari kami he
 To compensate for this, by providing training to them in various fields of medicine, no course of histo technician and blood collector was going on
 is tarah ke rojgaar meley se in kshetro main yuvaaon ko nayaa avasar milegaa or medical lab technitian kaa course, jo pehle do saal kaa hota tha, ab skill centre main kaushal vikaas mantralay ke dwaara ek saal main puraa karaayaa jayega

 After the central government's announcement, Sidhu tweeted and thanked the Modi government
 unhone likhaa ki is faisle se donon deshon ke bich shanti kaa sandesh jayega
 i thank the Govt
 of India from the core of my heart and take a bow! i request the Hon’ble PM of pakistan@imrankhanptisahib to take reciprocal steps for opening the Kartarpur Sahib corridor and spread Baba Nanak’s message of universal brotherhood and peace across the Globe
 - Navjot Singh Sidhu (@sherryontopp) November 22, 2018 Significantly, there was a lot of ruckus about Sidhu's visit to Pakistan, he claimed that it was during his visit that the Pakistan government prepared for the Kartarpur Sahib corridor
 'akali dal kii apil par hua faisla'kendriya mantri harsimrat cor ne bhi is par twit kiya
 She wrote that she thanks the Modi government for the Kartarpur Sahib corridor decided by the central government on the Akali Dal's appeal
 On Shiromani Akali Dal’s persistent requests, the cabinet has given green signal to opening up of Kartarpur Sahab corridor
 Eternally grateful to @ narendramodiji and the entire cabinet for taking this historic decision

 He wrote that the decision taken by the central government is historic
 navjot singh siddhu ke bare main unhone kaha ki koun siddhu, is bare main siddhu kaa koi bhi role nahin he
 Let us tell you that the first Sikh Guru Nanak Dev settled Kartarpur, he is said to have spent the last few years of his life here
 yahaan par ek gurudwara he, jise kartarpur sahib kaha jaataa he
 It is four kilometers from the india-pakistan border
 lekin nitish kumaar ke saamne sankat he
 He does not have to face Lalu Yadav face to face
 lalu ke dehati muhaavaron kaa tir andar tak pahunch jaataa he
 The answer is not with Nitish Kumar, an aristocrat
 isliye unhone apane pravaktaaon ko lalu yadav ke peeche laga rakhaa he
 But far from breaking the image of Lalu that exists in the society and especially among the backward, Dalits and Akalits of Bihar, it is not enough for their spokesmen to break it
 balki nitish ke logon kii lalu ke viruddh apmanjanak bhashaa daliton or pichhadon ko lalu ke peeche or golband kar rahi he
 After former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, now MP from Bhopal, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has named the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as a criminal
 shivaraj ke nehru ko apradhi kahe jane vaale bayaan par bhopal main pratikriya dete hue saansad pragna singh thakur ne kaha ki 'hamaare bharat ko jo bhi pidaa pahunchayegaa, hamaare bharat ko jo bhi khandit karne kaa prayaas karegaa, vah nishchit rup se apradhi hoga, isamen koi shaq nahin'
 Let us tell you that earlier Shivraj Singh Chauhan during the membership drive in Odisha had called the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru a criminal for imposing Article 370 in Kashmir, after which a controversy arose across the country
 haalanki baad main bhopal aakar shivaraj singh chouhan ne kaha tha ki jawaharlal nehru ko lekar unhone jo kuch bhi odisha main kaha, vah tathyon ke aadhaar par kaha
 Patriots are supporters of modi-shah
 Recently, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, who went to Delhi after electing MP from Bhopal, also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for removing Section 370 and 35A
 saansad pragna singh thakur ne yahaan tak kah diya ki jo log piem modi or grahamantri amit shah par garv kar rahe hai, vah desh bhakt hai
 While giving a statement on the removal of Article 370 from Kashmir, Sadhvi said that the category of patriots who have been separated after this has been separated
 deshbhakt ullas manaa rahe hai or jo ro rahe hai vah desh bhakt to ho hi nahin sakate
 Those who are happy with the removal of Sections 370 and 35A are proud of our country, those who are proud of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are patriots
 unhone kaha ki yah paribhaasha is baar siddh ho gai he ki koun desh ke saath he or koun desh ke viruddh he'
 Attack on Congress on Section 370: Congress President Pragya Singh Thakur attacked the Congress fiercely, calling Article 370 a product of Congress in Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki 'sansad main hamaare mananeey adhyaksh mahoday or desh ke grahamantri amit shah kaa agar aapane sansad main bhaashan suna hoga to unhone spasht kiya he ki pioke hamaare desh main hi he, kashmir main hi he
 370 was removed in the whole, that is, a united India
 vah bhaag alag nahin he or hamaare rashtriya adhyaksh ne to yahaan tak kah diya ki agar kisi ne isko alag karne kii koshish kii to ham iske liye jaan bhi de denge
 It is not a separate part, it is an integral part of our India
 digvijay par bhi saadhaa nishanakshmir se dhara 370 hatane par digvijay singh ke virodh par bhi sadhvi pragna singh thakur ne bayaan diya
 Let me tell you that recently, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur has defeated Digvijay Singh from Bhopal Parliamentary seat
 digvijay singh par sadhvi ne kaha ki 'ham to chunaav isliye lade the ki raashtra dharm ke liye kaam karne vaale logon ko bich main aana chahie
 At the same time, the people have absolutely rejected those who should not be here
 21 june ko karnataka kii vidhansabha ne do sampadakon ko ek saal ke liye jail bhejne kaa aadesh de diya
 In 2014, two Congress mlas and one BJP MLA took up the issue of publishing articles for defamation against the editors of two magazines
 us vakt ke spikar ne maamle ko visheshadhikaar samiti main bhej diya, us samiti ne apana prastaav diya or maujuuda spikar jo un teen shikayatakartaaon main shaamil the, in patrakaron ko jail bhejne kaa aadesh de diya
 The Privileges Committee says that Ravi Belagare did not appear even after repeated summons, but Anil Raju apologized
 lekin iske baad bhi donon kai aise lekh chhapate rahe jinase inaki manahani hoti rahi
 Just after the Speaker's order, the Secretary of the Assembly sent a message to the Additional Chief Secretary of the Government that the order should be followed
 jabaki media report main kaha gaya he ki donon patrikaon main jo kuch chapa tha uskaa sambandh sadan kii kaarywahi se nahin tha or na hi un lekhon se sadan kii kaarywahi main baadha pahunchati he
 The editors of Hi Bangalore and Yelahanka Voice have been sentenced to one year in jail as well as a fine of Rs 10,000
 is faisle ke baad se karnataka main congress sarkaar kii bhi aalochana ho rahi he ki jo party dilli main abhivyakti kii swatantraaa ko lekar awaz uthaati he, wo bengalooru main kaise yah sab hote dekh sakati he
 The current speaker, who was an MLA at the time, also complained of breach of privilege against magazines in 2014
 visheshadhikaar hanan ke maamle main ninda hoti he, fatkaaraa jaataa he magar jail bhejne kii sazaa kisi ne suni nahin
 Just from here the dispute started whether the legislature should take decisions which are the work of the judiciary
 jail bhejne kaa kaam nyaaypalika kaa hota he
 Earlier in 2006, the UP Assembly gave a notice of privilege on sting three mlas against IBN7
 haal hi main tivi today group ne jab muzaffarnagar dangon se sambandhit ek sting kiya tha tab vidhansabha ne visheshadhikaar kaa notice diya tha
 Now the case of Karnataka is in front
 kya in do patrakaron ko jail bhejne or jurmaana tay kar sadan ne apane visheshadhikaar kii seemaa kaa aisa vistaar kar diya he
 The Hindu newspaper wrote in its editorial on 26 June that the constitution has given certain privileges to the legislature to maintain freedom of expression within the House and not to create any pressure or influence in running the House
 kya kisi patrkaar yaa sadan ke baahar ke sadsy ko visheshadhikaar ke daayre main laayaa ja saktaa he
 a dialogue of Paan Singh Tomar recalls when Paan Singh's character says that if there are robberies in Parliament, does it become a matter of privilege
 kya koi lekh sadan kii prakriya main baadha daal saktaa he, sadan kii garima ko thes pahunchane vaale agar tatv hon bhi to kya visheshadhikaar kaa kanoon yaa prakriya in sab baton ko lekar spasht he
 In this context, we turned the pages of the book, Practice and Procedure of Parliament, whose authors are MN Call, SL Shakadhar and edited by PDT Acharya
 iske pej number 309 se 311 tak visheshadhikaar kii prakriya ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa hua he
 The Speaker's permission has to be obtained before a matter of privilege is raised in the House
 visheshadhikaar kaa maamla uthaane ke liye sadsy ko likhit rup main loksabhaa general secetry ko deni hoti he
 It is also mandatory to hand over the documents along with the notice
 notice milane ke baad spikar tay karata he ki sadan main visheshadhikaar kaa maamla uthe yaa nahin
 After this, the decision of the speaker is conveyed to the member
 spikar manaa bhi kar sakate hai
 Then the member can raise the question of privilege in the House
 sadan kii ek baithak main ek se zyaada visheshadhikaar ke maamle nahin uthaae ja sakate hai
 Notice of privilege is accepted only after the consent of the speaker
 visheshadhikaar samiti jab jaanch kar report detii he to spikar par nirbhar karata he ki wo use khaarij kar de yaa sweekaar kare
 If the speaker accepts, he is placed before the House and the House decides on that report
 is kitaab ke pej number 310 par likhaa he ki agar kisi akhbaar kii report main sadan kii kaarywahi ke maamle main galat jaankaree likhi gai he yaa sadan yaa sadasyon par pratikul tippanee kii gai he tab spikar ho saktaa he ki visheshadhikaar hanan ke maamle main faisla dene se pehle akhbaar ke sampadak ko apana paksh rakhane ke liye kahe
 If the editor apologizes or expresses regret, is ready to print the amendment, then the speaker does not allow the matter of breach of privilege
 kai baar sadsy is baat ke liye bhi visheshadhikaar kaa notice dene kii anumati maangate hai ki police adhikari ne marpet kii, dhakka-mukki kii yaa shishtachar kaa paalan nahin kiya
 What is written about this on page number 311 of this book is interesting
 ek ke baad ek kai spikar ne mana he ki agar sadsy sansadeey kaary se alag kisi kaam ke liye gaya he or uske saath dhakka mukki ho jaae yaa bura bartaav ho jaae to wo visheshadhikaar kaa hanan nahin he yaa phir shishtachar kaa paalan nahin hua to wo visheshadhikaar nahin hoga
 Suppose if someone makes adverse remarks about the Lok Sabha or its member within an assembly, then notice of privilege is not accepted in the Lok Sabha against him because every House has its own dignity and independence
 iske liye pej number 314 par ek dilachasp cese kaa zikr he sadan kii avmaananaa yaa visheshadhikaar ke hanan ke maamle main sazaa kaa praavdhaan he
 On the book number 272 in the book of Practice and Procedure of Parliament which i have cited, if the contempt or breach of privilege is not serious enough to arrest him, then the person of contempt would have been tortured with words by calling him at the threshold of the House
 is
 loksabhaa main abhi tak aise do maamle hue hai
 When harassed by calling at the threshold of the House
 matlab wo darvaaze par khadey rahete hai or sadan apni naakushi zaahir karata he
 One of these matters is an article in The Blitz, a weekly magazine
 ek cese main loksabhaa ke secetry general ko hi pratadit kiya gaya, magar unhen sadan kii dahleez par nahin bulaayaa gaya tha
 Only the proposal was passed in the house
 tippaniyan The Prosecution of Offenders on page number 273 states that the House has the power of legislature, executive and judiciary when deciding a matter of privilege
 sadan court kii tarah act kar saktaa he
 In this case, the House is supreme but the House will have to take a decision within the scope of the Constitution
 agar sadan chaahe to uske paas jo sazaa dene ke adhikaar hai wo paryaapt nahin he, tab wo is maamle ko adaalat main bhej saktaa he
 From what i read, it was understood that this can be challenged in the Supreme Court
 ek baar loksabhaa kii public gailaree main kisi vijater ne naare laga die
 The man had two pistols and also crackers
 sadan ne ek maheene kii kadi sazaa sunai thi
 On the speaker's order, the verdict was forwarded to the police
 19 disambar, 1978 ko chhathi loksabhaa ne purv pradhanmantri indira gandhi, aarake dhawan or di sen ko visheshadhikaar hanan ke maamle main do satron ke bich ke samay main jail bhejne kaa faisla sunaaya tha, sadan kii sadsyta se nilambit kar die jaaen
 But on 7 May 1981, the Seventh Lok Sabha passed a second resolution and declared all three as innocent
 visheshadhikaar cameti kaa kahana he ki ravi belagare baar-baar saman bhejne ke baad bhi haazir nahin hue, magar anil raju ne maafee maang lee
 But even after this, both of them continued to publish many such articles which kept defaming them
 bas spikar ke aadesh hote hi vidhansabha ke sachiv ne sarkaar ke atirikt mukhya sachiv ko sandesh bhej diya ki aadesh kaa paalan ho
 Whereas the media report said that what was published in both the magazines was not related to the proceedings of the House nor did those articles obstruct the proceedings of the House
 Hi Bangalore or yelahanka wois ke sampadakon ko ek saal kii jail ke saath-saath 10,000 rupee ke jurmaane kii bhi sazaa hui he
 Since this decision, the Congress government in Karnataka has also been criticized that the party which raises its voice for freedom of expression in Delhi, how can it see this happening in Bengaluru
 2014 main patrikaon ke kilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan kii shikaayat karne waalon main maujuuda spikar bhi hai, jo tab vidhayak the
 Condemnation in the case of breach of privilege is reprimanded, but no one listened to the punishment to be sent to jail
 bas yaheen se vivaad shuru ho gaya ki kya vidhayika ko wo faisle lene chahie jo nyaaypalika kaa kaam he
 It is the job of the judiciary to send them to jail
 isse pehle 2006 main upi vidhansabha ne ibien 7 ke khilaaf teen vidhayakon ke sting karne par visheshadhikaar kaa notice diya tha
 Recently, the Legislative Assembly had given notice of privilege when TV Today group conducted a sting related to the Muzaffarnagar riots
 ab karnataka kaa maamla saamne he
 Has the House extended the range of its privileges by sending these two journalists to jail and fixing the fine
 hindu akhbaar ne 26 june ke apane sampadakeey main likhaa he ki samvidhan ne vidhayika ko kuch visheshadhikaar die hai taaki sadan ke bheetar abhivyakti kii swatantraaa bani rahe or sadan chalaane main kisi prakaar kaa dabaav yaa prabhaav paidaa na kiya ja sake
 Can a journalist or member outside the house be brought under the purview of privilege
 paan singh tomars kaa ek dialog yaad aata he jab paan singh kaa kirdaar kahata he ki sansad main to daaku hote hai to kya yah visheshadhikaar kaa maamla banataa he
 Can any article obstruct the process of the House, even if there are elements which hurt the dignity of the House, is the law or procedure of privilege clear about all these things
 hamane is sandarbh main practice and prosijar of parliament naam kii kitaab ke panne palate jinke lekhak emen kol hai, esel shakdhar hai or jise pediti aacharya ne sampadit kiya he
 Much has been written about the process of privilege from its pages number 309 to 311
 sadan main visheshadhikaar kaa maamla uthaane se pehle spikar kii anumati leni hoti he
 In order to take up the matter of privilege, the member has to give it in writing to the Lok Sabha General Secretary
 notice ke saath-saath dastauez saunpna bhi anivaary hota he
 After receiving the notice, the speaker decides whether a matter of privilege arises in the House
 iske baad spikar kaa faisla sadsy ko bataa diya jaataa he
 The speaker can also refuse
 tab jaakar sadsy sadan main visheshadhikaar kaa sawaal uthaa saktaa he
 Matters of more than one privilege cannot be raised in a sitting of the House
 spikar kii sahmati ke baad hi visheshadhikaar kaa notice sweekaar hota he
 When the Committee of Privileges investigates and reports, it is up to the speaker to dismiss or accept it
 agar spikar swikar kar letaa he to use sadan ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he or sadan us report par faisla letaa he
 On page number 310 of this book it is written that if a newspaper report has written wrong information in the matter of the proceedings of the House or adverse remarks have been made on the House or the members, then the speaker can give the decision in case of breach of privilege Before asking the editor of the newspaper to present his case
 agar sampadak maafee maangata he yaa afsos zaahir karata he, sanshodhan chhapane ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he tab spikar visheshadhikaar hanan kaa maamla uthaaye jane kii anumati nahin detaa he
 Many times members also ask for permission to give notice of privilege to the fact that the police officer did not assault, push or obey courtesy
 iske bare main is kitaab ke pej number 311 par jo likhaa he wo dilachasp he
 One speaker after another has admitted that if the member has gone for some work other than parliamentary work and gets pushed or misbehaved, then that is not a breach of privilege or if courtesy is not followed
 Will not have privileges
 maan lijie ki kisi vidhansabha ke bheetar loksabhaa yaa uske sadsy ke bare main pratikul tippanee kar de, to uske khilaaf loksabhaa main visheshadhikaar kaa notice sweekaar nahin hota he kyonki har sadan kii apni garima or swatantraaa he
 For this, on page number 314, an interesting case is mentioned, there is a provision of punishment in case of contempt of the House or breach of privilege
 jis kitaab kaa maine hawala diya practice and prosijar of parliament usamen pej number 272 par likhaa he ki agar avmaananaa yaa visheshadhikaar kaa hanan bahut gambhir nahin he ki use giraftaar kiya jaae to avmaananaa karne vaale vyakti ko sadan kii dahleez par bulaakar shabdon se pratadit kiya jaataa he
 There have been two such cases in the Lok Sabha so far
 jab sadan kii dahleez par bulaakar pratadit kiya gaya he
 Meaning they stand at the door and the house expresses its unhappiness
 inamen se ek maamla ek saptahik patrika di blitz main chape lekh kaa bhi he
 In one case, the Secretary General of the Lok Sabha was tortured, but he was not called on the threshold of the House
 sirf house main prastaav paas hua tha
 The comments pej number 273 par prosicution of offenders main likhaa he ki visheshadhikaar ke maamle ko tay karte samay sadan ke paas vidhayika, karypalika or nyaaypalika kii shakti hoti he
 The House can act like a court
 is maamle main sadan hi sarvocch he magar sadan ko samvidhan ke daayre main hi faisla lenaa hoga
 If the House wants, then the punishment it has to give is not enough, then it can send the matter to the court
 jitna padhaa usase yahi samaj aayaa ki supreme court main ise chunauti di ja sakati he
 Once in the public gallery of Lok Sabha, a visitor shouted slogans

 The house had sentenced to a month's severe punishment
 spikar ke aadesh par is faisle ko police ke paas bhej diya gaya tha
 On 19 December 1978, the Sixth Lok Sabha had decided to send former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi, RK Dhawan and d Sen to jail in the midst of two sessions in the case of breach of privilege, be suspended from membership of the House
 magar 7 may 1981 ko saatvin loksabhaa ne ek doosraa prastaav paas kiya or in teenon ko nirdosh qaraar diya
 Condemnation in the case of breach of privilege is reprimanded, but no one listened to the punishment to be sent to jail

 In this context, we turned the pages of the book, Practice and Procedure of Parliament, whose authors are MN Call, SL Shakadhar and edited by PDT Acharya
 iske pej number 309 se 311 tak visheshadhikaar kii prakriya ke bare main kaaphi kuch likhaa hua he
 The Speaker's permission has to be obtained before a matter of privilege is raised in the House
 visheshadhikaar kaa maamla uthaane ke liye sadsy ko likhit rup main loksabhaa general secetry ko deni hoti he

 Notice of privilege is accepted only after the consent of the speaker
 visheshadhikaar samiti jab jaanch kar report detii he to spikar par nirbhar karata he ki wo use khaarij kar de yaa sweekaar kare
 If the speaker accepts, he is placed before the House and the House decides on that report

 Suppose if someone makes adverse remarks about the Lok Sabha or its member within an assembly, then notice of privilege is not accepted in the Lok Sabha against him because every House has its own dignity and independence

 agar sadan chaahe to uske paas jo sazaa dene ke adhikaar hai wo paryaapt nahin he, tab wo is maamle ko adaalat main bhej saktaa he
 From what i read, it was understood that this can be challenged in the Supreme Court

 When the Committee of Privileges investigates and reports, it is up to the speaker to dismiss or accept it
 agar spikar swikar kar letaa he to use sadan ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he or sadan us report par faisla letaa he
 On page number 310 of this book it is written that if a newspaper report has written wrong information in the matter of the proceedings of the House or adverse remarks have been made on the House or the members, then the speaker can give the decision in case of breach of privilege Before asking the editor of the newspaper to present his case
 agar sampadak maafee maangata he yaa afsos zaahir karata he, sanshodhan chhapane ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he tab spikar visheshadhikaar hanan kaa maamla uthaaye jane kii anumati nahin detaa he
 Many times members also ask for permission to give notice of privilege to the fact that the police officer did not assault, push or obey courtesy
 iske bare main is kitaab ke pej number 311 par jo likhaa he wo dilachasp he
 One speaker after another has admitted that if the member has gone for some work other than parliamentary work and gets pushed or misbehaved, then that is not a breach of privilege or if courtesy is not followed
 Will not have privileges

 For this, on page number 314, an interesting case is mentioned, there is a provision of punishment in case of contempt of the House or breach of privilege

 Let me tell you, currently there is no model curriculum for nursery education
 vahiin skool puri tarah se swatrant hai ki vah bacchon ko kya or kaise sikhaaya janaa chahie
 Some states, such as Delhi, have defined the criteria for nursery admission

 pre skulon main bacchon ko kaise di jaae shikshagideli main pre-skool skulon main pehle saal or duusare saal main teen lakshyon ko bataaya gaya he
 So that children can understand early studies correctly
 isamen bacchon ko achche swasthya ko banaae rakhane, effective communicator or paryaavaran se judane ke bare main padhaayaa janaa jaruri he
 Let us tell you, the NCERT document released for the education of children in the first year of pre-school, states 17 such things that children should learn in every pre-school

 The BJP, of course, won the Gujarat assembly elections, but this victory has definitely compelled the party to self-determination for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 18 disambar ke nateezon ne saaf kiya he ki pradhanmantri or bhaajapa adhyaksh donon ke liye unka grih-rajya tak 2014 ke mukaable party ke lihaaj se khastahal ho chukaa he
 The level that the party went to during campaigning to win, somehow worked in Gujarat, but in other states such an expectation may prove to be meaningless
 agle saal rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh or karnataka jaise bade rajyon main chunaav hone hai
 Except Karnataka, there is a BJP government in other states
 madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main to lagbhag 15 varshon se he
 In these states, the main competition of the BJP is with the Congress, where the state governments are going through anti-incumbency
 in rajyon main modi kaa craij gujarat jaisaa hona mushkil he
 However, BJP President Amit Shah has said after winning Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh that the victory is confirmed in 2019 but given the way the Congress has got a kick from Gujarat, the Congress will contest one of the elections in four states next year
 BJP leaders are also believing that it can emerge as a strong alternative
 vidhansabha chunaav nateezon ke baad party ke kai varisht netaa paroksh rup se yah maan rahe hai ki gujarat ke nateezon main bhaajapa chunaav jiti he to congress apni khoyi himmat ko paane main safal rahi he
 BJP President Amit Shah considers Prime Minister Narendra Modi the biggest factor of victory, which is quite right
 lekin 2014 main desh unase ummid kar rahaa tha jabaki 2019 main vah ummid par kitne khare utre, yah taulega
 Government schemes are running but are not able to prove very effective
 duusari baat yah bhi he ki gujarat se jahaan congress ko oxigen mili he vahiin vipakshi dalon ko yah lagane laga he ki modi kaa rath rokane ke liye majbootee ke saath congress ke saath aana hoga
 Significantly, from the spectacle of 2014 results, in Gujarat, BJP won 165 out of 182 assembly seats

 iske mutabik yahaan rahane vaale rohingya musalmaan sirf do hi bachche paidaa kar sakate hai
 Significantly, this order is only for Muslims

 These two places have the largest population of Muslims in the state
 agar puure desh kii baat kii jaae, to myanmar kii chah karod kii aabaadi main muslim chaar fisadi hai
 Regarding the order, government spokesperson Vin said, "the aim is to control the rapidly increasing number of Muslims
" ’ unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne jab haalia nasleey hinsa kii jaanch kii, to paaya ki muslimon kii aabaadi main teji se badhotaree takaraav kaa ek bada kaaran he

 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke matdaan main mahaj paanch din kaa samay baaki he
 There is a fierce contest between the Congress and the BJP
 jabaki jedies kingmekar kii bhoomika ke liye jaddojahad kar rahi he
 BJP is looking forward to feeding lotus in Karnataka with the help of BS Yeddyurappa's face
 yediurppa ke saath-saath bijepi or sangh kaa bhi majboot garh maane jane vaala ilaaka tateey karnataka (costal kshetra) he
 The BJP and RSS Hindutva laboratory in Karnataka is in this coastal belt
 tateey karnataka ilaake main pichley chunaav main yediurppa kii baghawat kaa khamiyaja bijepi ko bhugatna padaa tha
 At the same time, Congress got the benefit of this
 ab jab yediurppa phir bijepi ke liye khewanhaar bane hue hai or party hindutv kii siyaasi bisaat bichaane main juty he
 In such a situation, the contest in the coastal Karnataka region has become interesting
 tateey karnatakashetra ke tahat mangaluru, udupi or karwaar chikmaglur jile kii kareeb 20 vidhansabha siten aati he
 Anant Kumar Hegde, a minister in the central government and a firebrand leader of the Karnataka BJP, hails from Karwar district
 paanch baar ke saansad hegade kii pahchaan rajya main hindutv ke chehre ke taur par he
 In the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP had to fight expensively to contest Yeddyurappa's separation
 party ko baari nuksaan uthaanaa padaa tha
 Congress got 13 seats from this strong fort of BJP in the last assembly elections
 jabaki bijepi ko mahaj 3 siten mili thi
 Congress got 43 per cent of the votes in terms of vote share
 jabaki bijepi ko 34 fisadi, jedies ko 9 or anya ko 13 fisadi vot mili the
 Only a year after the assembly elections, did Yeddyurappa return to the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the party performed very well
 party ke costal kshetra main kareeb 55 fisadi vot mili, jabaki congress ko 3 fisadi vot kaa nuksaan uthaanaa padaa or use 40 fisadi vot mili
 Only the entire vote of JDS went to BJP
 jedies ko mahaj 0
 Got 3 percent votes
 2014 ke matdaan patternako vidhansabha kshetra ke maddenjar dekha jaae to bijepi 17 vidhansabha siton par aage rahi, jabaki congress keval 3 siton par aage rahi he
 BJP is desperate to repeat the performance in the assembly elections on the lines of Lok Sabha
 yahi vajah he ki anant hegade se lekar upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath tak hindutv kaa card khuleam khel rahe hai
 It is very difficult for the Congress to repeat the results of the last election
 yahi vajah he ki siddharmaiya dakshini karnataka ke saath-saath uttar karnataka kii seat par kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 Through this, they are trying to resolve both areas

 Even though the Indian Cricket Board has announced to play one-day and T20 in Sri Lanka with Pakistan, this series is not going to happen
 sarkaar kii hari jhandi ke bina ye series nahin hone vaali he or sarkaar aajkal ke maahaul main pakistan ke saath match ke liye taiyaar nahin he, bhale hi match srilanka main hi kyon na ho
 Ceasefire violations along the indo-pak border and increasing terrorist activity in Kashmir have forced the government to take such a decision
 bharat or pakistan ke bich sachiv str kii baatcheet bhi band he
 Now the question arises that why did the Indian board finally announce the match with Pakistan? darasal bharat or pakistan board ke bich en
 There was an agreement during Srinivasan's time

 Today was the last day to announce this series
 is qaraar kii vajah se pakistan board, bhartiya board par lagaataar dabaab bana rahaa tha
 If this series was not announced, Pakistan was also threatening to drag India to international court and pay damages of 300 to 500 crores
 aise main bhartiya board bharat-paak siries kii ghoshnaa kar kisi tarah pakistan kii karrwai se batch gaya
 The comments bisisiai ko maaloom he ki maujuuda maahaul main sarkaar kisi bhi haalat main bharat-pakistan siries kii anumati nahin degaa
 The Ministry of External Affairs has to give permission to play the match, as the matches are to be held in Sri Lanka
 vaise bharat-pakistan siries ke liye broadcaster yani match prasaarit karne vaale channel kaa bhi bisisiai par kaaphi dabaab he
 Its advocates say that if india-pakistan can play in the World Cup, then why not in Sri Lanka? But the government is currently refusing to accept these arguments and the indo-pak series in Sri Lanka in December should be considered canceled

 agar is siries kii ghoshnaa nahin hoti to pakistan bharat ko antarrashtriya adaalat main ghaseetne or 300 se 500 karod kaa harjaana dene kii dhamkee bhi de rahaa tha
 In such a situation, the Indian board somehow survived the action of Pakistan by announcing the indo-pak series
 tippaniyan The BCCI knows that in the current environment, the government will not allow the india-pakistan series under any circumstances
 match khilne ke liye videsh mantralay ko anumati deni he, kyonki match srilanka main hone vaale hai
 By the way, the channel broadcasting the match for india-pakistan series ie BCCI is also under tremendous pressure
 iske pakshdhar kehete hai ki agar bharat-pakistan world cap main khel sakate hai to srilanka main kyon nahin? magar sarkaar in daleelon ko philhal maanane se inkaar kar rahi he or disambar main srilanka main hone vaali bharat-paak siries ko radd hi mana janaa chahie

 saath hi aadhunik hathiyaaron kii kharid or naye caderon kii bhartee bhi kii he
 An officer associated with intelligence agencies said that during the hostage crisis, the state police and central paramilitary forces had suspended action against the Naxalites
 is dauraan naksali barudi surang kaa bada jaal bichaane main kaamyaab ho gayi
 The official quoted a special report sent by central agencies to Naxal-affected states, saying that the Maoists have strengthened their positions in Narayanpur, Bijapur, Surguja, Bastar, Dantewada, Kanker and Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh
 unhone bataaya ki report main odisha ke bare main ullekh he ki vahaan ke malkangiri, sambalpur, raigarh, gajpati or devgarh main naksaliyon ne barudi surangon kaa jaal bichaaya he
 The official said the anti-naxal operations of the security forces were hampered by the kidnapping of Italian tourists Paolo Bosusco and Kadio Colango, BJD MLA Jhina Hikaka and Sukma Collector Alex Pal Menon
 unhone bataaya ki karrwai sthagit hone kii sthiti main naksaliyon dwaara naye caderon kii bhartee or bade paimaane par aadhunik hathiyaar kharidne kii bhi khabaren hai
 The officer said that no specific action could be taken against the Naxalites for about two months

 It is also a matter of trouble that the local intelligence gathering system is also finding difficulty in monitoring the activities of Naxalites
 unhone kaha ki barudi surangen surakshabalon ko naksaliyon kaa peechha karne main dikkat karengi
 Especially when the Naxals are fleeing from one state to another and the security forces are chasing them
 adhikari ke mutabik junglee raaston se maovadi acchhee tarah waakif hai or unhen maaloom hota he ki barudi surang kahaan bichhaayi gayi he
 Some areas are completely unknown to the security forces and if they pass through an area where landmines are lying, then there can be large casualties

 50-year-old Savaragiri Birenjul Salwa, who lives in this colony, had migrated after the Judum with his family to the forest of Cherla in Andhra Pradesh

 About 250 families were displaced by this settlement and barely 400 people now live in this settlement with a population of more than 2,500
 badakismati se salwa judum abhiyaan ne samaaj ko do hisson main baant diya
 While the tribals going to the camp were considered with the administration, on the insistence of not leaving their land in the village, they were attacked by the people associated with the campaign, insisting that the adamant people are pro-naxalites
 haalanki supreme court 2011 main salwa judum abhiyaan ke tahat adivasee yuvaaon ko espeo banaakar unhen naksaliyon ke khilaaf istemaal karne ko asanvaidhanik tehra chukaa he
 But by then, the impact of the destruction of his ancestral land and house had started to show the deep impact on the lives of tribals

 The most affected district is Bijapur, from where the Salwa Judum campaign began

 However, due to the disappearance of the tribe in Australia, the PM there had to apologize
 ’’ ve salwa judum or combing oparation ko aabaadi dar main giravat kii mukhya vajah maanati hai

 Under this law, no one can displace people living in the forest for generations without proper writing

 chidambaram ne aatankwaad ke masale par prayaas tej kiye hai or pakistan par yah dabaav daalaa he ki vah in tathyon ko sweekaar kare ki jandaal ne mumbai par hamalaa karne vaale aatankiyon ko prashikshit kiya tha
 On the other hand, Antulay described his statement of 27 November as a "natural mistake"
 unhone kaha, ''hamale ke baad kai tarah kii kahaniyaan saamne aa rahi thim, khaskar karkare kii maut se judi hui
 However, Antulay accepts that the angle of Hindu terrorism had diverted the attention of the country from the let side for a moment
 musharif ab yah kehete hue koi tippanee karne se inkaar karte hai ki 26 / 11 kaa maamla court main he
 But he definitely said that he has never questioned the role of Pakistan in this attack
 barney ke akhbaar ne apni khabar ke liye 29 janvari, 2010 ko pehle pej par khed prakashit kiya tha
 But Bernie himself has no regrets on this and says that many of the questions of 26 / 11 have still not been answered
 film nirmaataa mahesh bhatta kehete hai ki isamen pakistan kii bhoomika se koi inkaar nahin kar saktaa, lekin vah bhartiya jaanch agenciyon dwaara ab prasaarit kii ja rahi kahaniyon par bhi bharosa nahin karte or is par bahes kii jarurat bataate hai
 "after the 9 / 11 attacks, people in America raised many questions about the identity of the attackers," he says
 unke is vichaar ko lekar kisi ne bhi khed prakat nahin kiya he
 Kavita Karkare, wife of Hemant Karkare, believes that recent developments have confirmed her stand that the attack is not a domestic conspiracy
 lekin pakistan ko koi khed nahin he
 Now he is trying to distance himself from this Indian colleague Ansari
 ansaari ke bharat pahunchane ke sirf ek hafte baad 27 june ko pakistan ke grih mantri rahamaan malik ne jaldbaaji main ek press conference yojit kii
 Malik said, "now things are getting clear
 koun jaanata he, shaayad bharat main kisi ne sting oparation kiya ho?'' malik ne apni sena or iesai kaa bachaav kiya, lekin is baat par chup hi rahe ki bhartiya naagarik ansaari ne aakhir pakistan kaa passport or pravasi pakistaniyon ko milane vaala rashtriya pahchaan patr kaise hasil kar liya
 On 4 to 5 July, between India and Pakistan, Foreign Secretary level talks in New Delhi, an unnamed source from the Pakistani Embassy told the media that 40 Indian nationals were involved in the Mumbai attack
 saaf he ki ek ansaari ke pakad main aane se duniya main jihad ke sabase khatarnaak khilaadi ke mansoobey kamjor nahin hue hai
 Look forward to the next round of conspiracy theory, which will be written and promoted by Islamabad

 Regardless of what women like to wear, most men believe that women look the most beautiful and hot in a sari

 44 of the men included in this survey
 5 fisadi ne kaha ki unki najar main mahilaon ke liye sari hi sabase behatar dress he
 In such a situation, the question arises that what is there in a sari that makes women more hot in the eyes of men? Some of the reasons for this may be: Sarees are traditionally considered a decent dress for women
 ye shaleenta hi mahilaon ko khubasurat banaati he
 As much of the female body is covered in a sari, it attracts men more towards them
 dhaki hui khubsuurati besange khulepan kii tulana main mahilaon ko zyada sexi luk detii he
 The sari is wrapped several times neatly on the body
 sex sambandh banane se pehle purushon ko ise utaarne main kaaphi vakt ganvaana padataa he
 This impatience of men calls women 'very hot'

 It is said that the Congress is exploring the possibility of an alliance with Mayawati's BSP and Lalu Prasad's RJD in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 isse party kii loksabhaa main kul 120 siten dene vaale bihar evam uttar pradesh main sambhaavnaaen behatar ho sakati hai
 a senior Congress leader, on the condition of not disclosing his identity, said that if Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP was also included in this type of alliances, it could also get an advantage in 14 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand
 is tarah ke gathbandhan kaa haryana evam punjab jaise rajyon main bhi prabhaav padegaa
 He argues that the UPA could be transformed into three realities if the Congress had an alliance with Mayawati, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan in North India
 party main yah soch chal rahi he ki congress basapa kaa gathbandhan uttar pradesh main majboot gathjod ban saktaa he

 He said that due to pressure from the community, Mayawati may be forced to tie up with the Congress
 mayawati abhi tak is baat par kaayam hai ki unki party kaa loksabhaa chunaav main kisi ke saath gathbandhan nahin hoga
 The equation in the Congress is that if it succeeds in forming an alliance in the north, it will get allies in the south as well and some of those who leave the UPA will return
 bijepi narendra modi ko apana pradhanmantri pratyaashee banane ke baad apni chunavi ranneeti main uttar pradesh evam bihar par bahut adhik dhyaan de rahi he

 baba rahaam rahim ke sirsa vaale 700 acre ke dere main kareeb 600 kankal dafn hai
 The agent of Baba's own camp has told the police
 magar jo nahin bataaya wo ye ki ye saare kankal moksh vaale hai yaa phir katl kiye jane ke baad kankal bane hai? darasal dere ke andar jo maut swaabhaavik hoti thi, use moksh ke naam par baba dere ke andar hi dafan karvaa detaa tha
 While many people are still mysteriously missing from the camp
 shaq he ki baba ne unhen marava diya
 So now the question is how will the police distinguish which skeleton is salvation and which one is slaughtered? Baba dug a lot of such pits in his camp of 700 acres
 unamem paudhe bhi lagaae
 Sometimes mango and sometimes guava
 kabhi tulsi ke to kabhi alovira ke
 People had their eyes on Baba's plants
 magar in gaddhon main jhaank kar kisi ne nahin dekha
 Looking at it, what would be known was that there were 600 bodies that had cooled down
 baba ke baad dere kii sabase khasmkhas vipasana or dow
 PR Nain is in the custody of Haryana Police
 unase special invastingting team yani esaiti lagaataar poochtacha kar rahi he
 The Vice President of Dera Sacha Sauda piaar nain ne dhaai ghante hui poochtacha main baba ke bare main jo khulaasa kiya he wo naa sirf zamin ke upar balki zamin ke neeche bhi bhuuchaal laane vaala he
 According to Haryana Police Dr
 nain ne bataaya deraa ke sirsa mukhyalay kii jameen ke andar kareeb 600 logon kii haddiyaan or kankal maujuud ho sakate hai
 These are the ashes of those devotees of Baba, who were pressed into the ground of the camp with the belief that by doing so they would get salvation
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya saare kankal moksh ke moh vaale hai? 600 main se sabhi maut natural hui? sabhi marane waalon ke deth certificate hai? yaa phir moksh vaali laashen or qatl vaali laashen mila di gayi hai? aisa pehali baar nahin he, jab dere kii zamin ke andar asthiyaan hone kaa khulaasa kiya gaya he
 Even before this, the newspaper of the camp 'sach Kahoon' had revealed that the skeletons have a graveyard below these broad crops
 deraa parisar main jesibi mashiinon se khudaai ke dauraan kai logon kii asthiyaan mil sakati hai
 Which will be of those seekers who died naturally in the camp
 dera pramukh apane anuyaayiyon ko mritkon kii asthiyaan nadi main bahaane se manaa karte tha
 Because it increases pollution
 isliye mritkon kii asthiyaan deraa praangan main hi dabaa di jaati thim
 And trees were planted at that place
 dere ke adhikari or akhbaar jo kah rahe hai usamen sach kitna he jhooth kitna he
 At the moment there is no scale to measure it
 jab tak yahaan kii zamin main dafn kankalon kaa sach baahar nahin aa jaataa
 If she could speak the ground, she would scream and say why the buried people were buried
 aasmaan bolta to gavaahi detaa marane vaale moksh ke liye mare, yaa baba kii mukhalfat main maar die gaye
 But this cannot be done, so the wait for this truth will be till the digging starts inside the camp
 baba ke dere main in 600 kankalon kaa sach tah dar tah dafn he
 On the first floor, it is perennial farming
 or duusari tah main laashen hai
 The truth of which is yet to be revealed
 magar usase pehle hi dere ke logon ke munh se khauf ke maare sachch footne laga he
 How can the officials of Baba's camp claim so confidently about the number of skeletons under the ground
 jabaki unke paas marane waalon kii koi fehrist bhi nahin
 Does he fear that when the government JCB machines dig the ground, Baba's misdeeds with the skeletons will also be revealed
 un gumshuda logon kaa bhi jo dere main aae to the magar kabhi waapas nahin laute
 It is certain that the roots of these plants in Baba's camp will surely collide with human bones under the ground
 kyonki dere ne ab khud is zamin ke neeche kankalon ke kabristaan kii baat kabool lee he
 But this claim is of the true deal
 jo in kankalon ko un logon se jod rahaa he jo moksh ke liye yahaan dafn hai
 But what to do for those who went missing in Baba's camp
 koi 6 maheene se
 
 koi salbhar se
 
 koi 5 saal se
 
 to koi das saal se
 As long as Baba was outside, he used to say that once someone entered the tent, then no news of it comes out
 na marane ke baad uski laash
 Everything is suppressed here
 700 acre ke is dere main aise na janekitne hi raaj dafnhai
 On which you are seeing these flowering crops today
 dere kii is jayeein ke neeche kitni zindagiyaan dafn hai
 Whose skeletons belong kitne hai
 Who were to die kahaan ke the
 It is difficult to guess
 na to police ko ab tak un logon kii list mil pai he jo bakaul dere ke yahaan moksh paane ke liye dafn hai
 However, former devotees of Baba claim that salvation is an excuse
 is zamin ke neeche un tamaam logon kii laashen dafn hai, jo baba ke khilaaf jane kii jurrat kar rahe the
 He is killed and buried here
 philhal deraa sachcha sauda kii cheirperson vipasana insa or vaais president dow
 From PR Nain, the SIT of Haryana Police is ascertaining where in the ashram the 600 dead bodies were buried
 taaki is baar jesibi mashine sirf baba ko daraane ke liye nahin balki zamin se uske raaj khod nikaalane ke liye istemaal kii jaaen
 It is very difficult to detect them from the skeletons under the ground
 magar naammumkin nahin he
 a lot can be found by examining bones in medical science
 magar sawaal ye ki dere main dafn narkankalon kaa sach aakhir he kya
 About 12,000 Hindus in Jammu and Kashmir have joined the confluence of the Jhelum River and Sindh stream in Ganderbal district on Tuesday for 'mahakumbh'
 shraddhaluon main adhikansh kashmiri pandit hai
 Ashutosh Bhatnagar (44), who arrived in Jammu and Kashmir from Delhi to participate in the Mahakumbh, said, "the last such coincidence was made in 1941, after 75 years and 10 days, the same coincidence has happened again
" " bhatnagar kashmiri pandit nahin hai
 He said that Sangam in Saidipora village of Ganderbal district has been considered very sacred to the local Pandit community, in which they immerse the ashes of the dead
 bhatnagar ne kaha, "mahakumbh aisa samaaroh he, jise shraddhalu ganvaana nahin chaahate or yahi kaaran he ki is pavitra samaaroh kaa hissaa hone ke liye ham yahaan baari sankhya main jute hai
 " is saal ke mahakumbh kii ghoshnaa omkarnath shastri ne kii he, jo ek jyotishi hai or unka parivaar 1990 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main kashmiri panditon ke kashmir chhodane se pehle kashmiriyon ke liye paanchang prakashit karne ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Sangam convenor Bharat Raina said, “kumbh occurs every 12 years and Ardh Kumbh occurs every six years
 " He said that the 12-hour long havan started at Sangam on Monday, which will last till Tuesday
 unhone kaha, "is maukey par shraddhalu sangam main pavitra dubkee lagaate hai or ek vishesh sthaan tak jate hai, jahaan kaaphi lambey samay se chinar kaa ek vriksh maujuud he
 " raina ne kaha, "sangam kaa yah hissaa is pavitra sthal kaa garbh grih he
 Devotees offer water to the Shivling present on the island
 havan ke baad shraddhalu prasad lete hai or apane aasapaas ke logon main use vitarit kar baaki ghar le jate hai
 " aisa pehali baar he, jab ghati se kashmiri panditon ke palaayan ke baad itani adhik sankhya main ve is samaaroh main hissaa lene aae hai
 Earlier, in 2011, 35,000 Hindus gathered at the Sangam to celebrate Pushkar

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched the 'startup India' campaign to facilitate new business in the country and encourage young entrepreneurs for it
 pradhanmantri ne iske liye agle chaar saal main 10 hajaar karod rupee kaa fund banane kii ghoshnaa kii
 Every year, funds worth Rs 2500 crore will be given to start-ups
 unhonellicense-permit raaj se is koshish ko dur rakhane kaa bhi bharosa dilaayaor kaha ki starop se hone vaala laabh teen saal tak kar mukt rahegaa
 The Prime Minister also assured to create a system of liberation from Inspector Culture

 Although the work culture of government departments, the Prime Minister is announcing the abolition of the license-permit raj for startups, but passing files to government offices in India is not so easy
 iske alaava tamaam tarah kii manzooriyaan hasil karnaa bhi udhyamiyon ke liye yahaan kaam karne main sabase badi mushkil sabit hoti rahi hai
 Giving information about the action plan, the PM said that neither tax nor any official will come for investigation for 3 years on the profit of the startup

 Tax Structure However, during the Start India program, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley indicated that the tax structure for startups may be different
 pehle se hi desh main karon ko saral banane ke liye laae jane vaale jiesti vidheyak ko lekar siyaasi gatirodh jari he
 In such a situation, it will be difficult to say that the government will be able to present a separate legal framework for the startup and even if this happens, how much time it will take will be a challenge

 Fund raisingpm said that there is no shortage of ideas in our country and we will make full use of the potential of the youth
 haalanki, is disha main fund kii kami badi chunauti sabit ho sakati he
 The government has announced to create a fund of 10 thousand crores for this in the next four years
 isamen har saal 2500 karod rupee kaa fund starpeps ko die jaaenge
 But will this fund be able to meet the needs of such a large young population of the country? Seed funding culture in India has not yet developed
 jin idiaj ko sahi funding kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, unhen vah nahin mil paata
 Government grants can play an important role in boosting startups, but that is not enough

 rojgaar ke morche parapiem ne starop india kaarykram kaa ection plan saamne rakhte hue kaha ki desh ke yuvaaon ko job sikar kii maansikta se nikaalkar job creatre banane par focus hoga
 This is also possible because 70% of the jobs in America have come out through startups
 lekin bharat kii shaikshik vyavastha or rojgaar tak pahunchane ke sadhano main iske liye bade badlaav kii jarurat hogi or ye baat itani jaldi kar paanaa sambhav nahin dikh rahaa

 So far, many technology-based startups are already working in the Indian system directly operating
 lekin jamini taur par kaam karne vaale starpeps jaise krishi, jaev takneekee or anya ke liye yuvaaon kaa skill development karnaa hoga
 In such a situation, the government will have to take special care in running skill development campaign for these areas
 varanaa jamini str par iskaa laabh pahunchane main lanbaa samay lag jayega
 Good thing India ranks third in the world with 4,200 enterprises
 bharat sirf america or britain se hi starpeps ke maamle main peeche he
 Investors and venture capitalists around the world see India as the best destination for startups
 sarkaar is disha main teji se badlaavon ko apanaate hue desh ke buniyadi vikaas se yuva shakti ko saath hi nivesh ko jod sakati he
 India's young population and large resources can serve as an energy source
 narendra modi ke shandaar kaarykaal kii sakshi rahi mukhyamantri kii kursi kii nazren ab anandiben patel par tiki hui hai
 Will she be able to fulfill this huge responsibility? She appeared completely confident during a conversation with senior editor Uday Mahurkar
 prastut he unase hui baatcheet ke ansh:narendra modi kii viraasat ko aage badhanaa kya mushkil nahin hoga?nahin

 i feel very proud of it
 narendrabhai ke liye yah or bhi badi uplabdhi he kyonki ve lagaataar kehete rahe hai ki samaaj ko aurat kii shakti kaa prabhavi istemaal karnaa chahie
 This is the result of the efforts of the Modi government to empower women
 mujhe ab bhi yaad he ki 2001 main unke mukhyamantri banane par jab maine unhen jaankaree di ki gujarat main mahila or bal kalyaan ke liye koi alag mantralay nahin he, to ve hairaan rah gaye the

 phir sampatti ke malikana haq main mahilaon ko baraabar kaa bhagidaar banane ke uddeshy se hamane ek nayaa niyam banaaya ki agar sampatti kii maalik koi mahila he to use panjikaran shulk nahin dena hoga
 This gave the state treasury Rs 560 crore in the last 10 years
 karod kaa ghaataa hua
 But it gave many women a chance to own property and gave them a secure future
 mukhyamantri ke rup main aapaki sabase badi praathamikta kya he?main chaahati hum ki technology ke istemaal par jor ho
 In the form of organizing public courts in rural areas, including the Collector and District Development Officers, a system should be devised so that people do not have to come to Gandhinagar Secretariat for most of their problems
 vichaar yah he ki log jahaan rahete hai, vahiin unki samasyaon ko sulajhaya jaae
 At the same time, i want officers to work among people instead of working from their office
 meraa anubhav kahata he ki prashasan main sudhaar karne ke liye yah sabase jaruri he
 What is your greatest achievement as a minister? There are many, not one
 pichley 17 varshon main kai upaay pesh kiye, jisase jamini str par logon ke jivan main badlaav hua
