 kejariwal:dilli vidhansabha chunaavon se ain pehle AAP ke kuch varisht netaaon ne party netritv par sawaal uthaate hue istipha de diya tha

 See how long they can overcome it
 senior netaaon kii chuttimodi:varisht netaa laal krishna adwani or murali manohar joshi ko modi ne maardarshak mandal main bhej diya
 Kejriwal: Yogendra Yadav and Shanti Bhushan were fired from the aac's PAC
 rahul:team rahul gandhi ko party ke varisht netaaon ke virdohi swar kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 They have to overcome this situation with strictness
 taanaashaahee kii jaruratmodi:un par aarope lagate rahe hai ki vah taanashaah kii tarah party main vyavhaar karte hai
 Kejriwal: Other AAP leaders alleged that Kejriwal does not believe in internal democracy
 rahul:party main uthte virdohi swar ko dabaakar unhen sidhe taur par netritv kii kaman sanbhaalani hogi

 Shah always stays with Modi like a right hand man
 kejariwal:jab vah bade muddon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai to manish sitaudiya unke roj ke saare jaruri kaam sambhalate hai
 Rahul: They may have a big team but they need a reliable and experienced colleague
 jo unke saath majbootee se khadaa ho
 Choose the marks carefully Modi: After coming to power, Modi is choosing his marks very carefully
 jab mauka aata he, tabhi wo saamne aakar bayaan dete hai
 Kejriwal: After winning Delhi, instead of focusing elsewhere, he is fulfilling the promises made to the public
 rahul:samay kii najaakat ko dekhte hue unhen saavdhaanee se muddon ko uthaanaa hoga jisase khud unki kirakiri na ho

 The BJP has shown Jaswant Singh a way out of the party
 unhen party kii praathmik sadsyta se bhi alag kar diya gaya he
 This is probably the first time that the BJP expelled a leader from the party without giving any notice
 shimla main ho rahi he chintan baithkaaj se shimla main bijepi kii chintan baithak shuru hui he
 Jaswant Singh went to Shimla but did not reach the meeting
 party adhyaksh rajnath singh ne bataaya ki unhone kal hi jaswant ko baithak main aane se manaa kar diya tha
 It is believed that Jaswant got this punishment due to his 'jinnah-love'
 jaswant ne apni kitaab main jinna ko secular bataaya he or desh ke bantwaare ke liye nehru or patel ko zimmedaar tehraaya he
 The Sangh was already concerned about the book; There is already a lot of ruckus in the saffron brigade regarding the Khafis book
 haalanki bijepi ne jaswant ke vichaaron se khud ko alag kar liya tha lekin mana yahi ja rahaa tha ki shimla chintan baithak main is masale par party koi kadaa kadam zarur uthaaegi
 The latest reason to expel Jaswant from the party is his book Jaswant Singh, written about Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in his book, attributed the partition to Nehru and Patel instead of Jinnah

 Police vs Advocate Dispute in Delhi Demonstration of soldiers outside the headquarters of Badalpolis is also face-to-face of the law and defenders of the law in the capital of Adesh, Delhi, on suspension of policemen
 shanivaar ko tees hajaari court main ek maamuli baat par police or vakeelon ke bich bhidnt ho gai, baad main vakeelon ne aagjanee kii or police ko firing kerani padi
 Just because of this, this dispute went on increasing, which went from one court to another and from one city to another
 ab dilli police mukhyalay ke baahar police jawan insaaf ke liye pradarshan kar rahe hai or apni maang ko lekar ade hai
 Where did the dispute begin? On Saturday, a dispute started in Tis Hazari Court over parking of a lawyer's car, first leading to arrest, then violent clashes and later open street fighting
 bhidnt ke bich dilli police kii ore se firing bhi kii gai
 Two lawyers were injured
 jiske baad vakil zyada bhadak gaye or police jeep or vahaan maujuud kai vaahanon main aag laga di gai
 The lawyers allege that when the firing was carried out by the Delhi Police, it hit the chest of a lawyer present there
 shanivaar ko tees hajaari court ke baad dilli ke saket, kadakadduma court main bhi vakeelon ne pulicekarmiyon par hamalaa kiya
 After this, in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, the lawyer beat the policeman
 After Tis Hazari, Karkardooma, it's Saket court today
 No fear of the law and tearing apart the order
 No argument can justify this behaviour
 What's more surprising is the way @ delhipoliceis handling with its hands tied due to lack of a strong leadership at the top

 Policemen are protesting outside the Delhi Police, saying that they are not feeling safe at the moment, because where a group of lawyers are looking at a policeman, they are attacking him
 jaisaa ki tees hajaari court ke baad saket court, kadakadduma court main bhi vakeelon ne pulicekarmi par hamalaa kar diya tha
 The policemen say that their words should be heard, the lawyers who have made the mistake that even the policemen should be punished should not be suspended
 apni isi maang ko lekar dilli police ke javaanon ne mangalvaar ko dilli police headquarter ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 What is the demand for lawyers? If we talk about lawyers, they have only one demand that the policemen who have been firing and beating lawyers outside Tis Hazari Court should be suspended
 darasal, jis vakt vakil tees hajaari court ke get par pradarshan kar rahe the tab ek-do vakil andar aa gaye the, jinhen pulisavaalon ne jamkar peeta tha
 Several IPS of the country tweeted and supported the police personnel on the issue of a confrontation between the police and lawyers who came together
 kai IPS ne twit kar likhaa ki pulicekarmiyon ke liye maanavadhikaar ke niyam lagu hone chahie, unka bhi parivaar he
 In such a situation, action should be taken against the lawyers who attack police personnel

 The biggest boss of terror is plotting a new conspiracy against India
 ye sajeesh bagdadi kaa plan-25 he
 When Baghdadi failed to establish ISIS in India, it hatched a conspiracy of terror on social media through its handlers sitting outside India
 is sajeesh main aatanki aakaa ke 20 gurgey or 5 hasinaayen shaamil hai
 Yes, when the crackdown on Baghdadi operatives in India broke the back of a terrorist conspiracy in India, it made a new bet
 hindustan main apana jaal failaane ke liye bagdadi ne 25 gurgon kii fouj taiyaar kii he
 These include both women and men
 bagdadi ke wo gurgey duniya ke alag-alag hisson se baithkar bhartiya yuvaaon ko lubhaane-lalachaane or bargalane main jute hai
 Revealing this conspiracy by ISIS, sources in the intelligence investigation agency NIA said that 25 foreign women and male handlers are sitting in different decades to lay a trap to involve the youth of India in ISIS
 ajtak ko mili khufia jaankaree ke mutabik in mahilaon main keran naam kii mahila philippines se, ameena naam kii mahila kenya se, fatima or aesha leena argentina se or AJ naam kii mahila srilanka se oparate kar rahi he
 These women handlers are working with the UMM code name to dodge the Indian intelligence agencies
 ameena apane husn ke jaal se bhartiya yuvaaon ko lubhaane or unhen gumraah kar aatanki sanghathan iesas main shaamil karaane kii sajeesh kaa ahm kirdaar he
 Hasina is doing nefarious kamukhfiya sources, if she has come to Hyderabad for this purpose
 apni 5 hasinaaon ke jaal ke saath hi bagdadi ne 20 videshi purush bhi apane napak kaam ko anjaam dene ke liye lagaae hai
 One of these handlers is named Khalid
 vah UAE main baithkar jammu-kashmir ke yuvaaon par sajeesh kaa jaal failaa rahaa he
 With the help of 20 operatives and 5 beauties, Baghdadi, the world's largest terrorist, is in the grip of ISIS in India
 wo bharat ke khilaaf sajeesh main bhartiya yuvakon ko hi bananaa chahta he hathiyaar
 All the investigative agencies on social media have become watchful and alert after this revelation of the NIA, the greed-hunted agency of Husn, Hur and Jannat
 bharat main iesas ke kareeb 48 sandigdh aatanki desh ke alag-alag thikaanon se pakade gaye to aatank ke aakaa bagdadi ne plan-25 banaaya
 This conspiracy to trap Indian youth into a trap of Husn and Hur is divided into 3 parts
 duniya ke alag-alag hisson main baithe iesas ke handler soshal media ke jariye bhartiya yuvaaon ko apane jaal main fansaa rahe hai
 Targeting through social media is the first step of his conspiracy
 bagdadi ke wo handler soshal media par khubasurat ladakiyon kii tasviren post karte hai
 Post their videos
 husn ke is jaal se wo bhartiya yuvaaon ko apane shikanje main laana chaahate hai
 They give a message on social media that if they come with us, they will get beautiful friends
 hamaari raah main qurbaan hue to jananath milegi or jananath main hoor milengi
 With this, they target 25 educated handlers who need jobs
 dikhaate hai dehshat ke farji videovo bhartiya yuvaaon kii bhaawanaaon ko bhadakaate hai
 For this Baghdadi's brigade then weaves a trap of deceit
 wo bhartiya yuvaaon ko aise video dikhaate hai, jinhen dekhakar kisi kaa bhi khun khul uthe
 Such videos are completely fake
 isamen muslimon par julm hota dikhaaya jaataa he
 This is the most important part of Baghdadi's plot
 kyonki khauf or dehshat ke farji video ke jariye hi bhartiya yuvaaon ke dil-dimag main nafrat kaa jehar bharaa jaataa he
 Seeing this, they turn against their own country
 kya he aatank kaa UMM kodehindustan main bagdadi kii nai sajeesh kaa code UMM he
 According to the information received by Aaj Tak, 25 people from all over the world have been chosen by Baghdadi to spread their roots in India, their code name is UMM
 aatank ke is code kaa ek cheharaa to khufia jaanch agency ke saamne he
 But the intelligence agency is looking for the remaining 24 faces
 haalanki, unke bare main bhanak mil chuki he
 But the NIA does not want to disclose them yet
 andeshaa he ki isse bagdadi ke gurgey aatank kii kisi gupha main ja chhipenge

 The government said that in order to provide subsidy on domestic LPG gas cylinders, the connection of customers' bank account number and Aadhar card number is being added, in such a situation that there is a competition to meet the targets of gas companies and agencies
 aise main sabhi niyam or kanoonon ko taakh par rakh kar agencia graahakon se jabaran aadhaar card or bank acount number lene lagi or graahakon dwaara aisa na karne par lagbhag hajaaron kii sankhya main conection tak block kar die, jisase in companiyon ke graahak kaaphi pareshaan ho rahe hai
 However, the provision of such coercion has not been provided by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas
 gas companiyon kii is manamanion ke liye jab kai graahakon ne mantralay main shikaayat kii to aanan-fanan main agenciyon dwaara gas conection bhi chaalu kar die or shikaayat vaapis lene ke aagrah bhi kiye gaye
 In such a situation, it is clear that the gas agency is harassing thousands of customers due to its arbitrariness
 uttam nagar nivasee bujurg vidhinath (75), jo lagbhag 20 saalon se bharat gas ke graahak he, jinhone beete 12 march ko bharat gas ke najafagarh sthit naushin gas agency ke khilaaf mantralay main ek i- mail daal kar apni shikaayat darj karai
 They have alleged that for the past several months, the gas agencies have been doing their own arbitrariness and have blocked their connections due to not providing the Aadhar card and bank account number
 gas agenciyon kaa kahana he kii jab tak aadhaar card or bank acount number jamaa nahin karaayenge tab tak gas silendar nahin milegaa, jabaki aisa koi bhi niyam petroleum or prakritik gas mantralay main lagu nahin kiya gaya he
 In such a situation, when 75-year old Vidhanath complained about this in an e-mail in the ministry, the phone started getting frequent calls from the gas agencies and the gas agency asked to open the connection and send the gas cylinders, but neither the gas agency nor This mistake was not considered by the gas company nor any action was taken
 gas agenciyon kaa saaf kahana he ki lagbhag 4000 conection gas company ke marketing head ke kehane par block kiya gaya he
 Such is the case of many families, not just one
 ham aapako bataa den ki jahaan ek taraf sarkaar gharelu alpiji gas kii kalabazari rokane ke liye or graahakon ko sabsidi dwaara laabh dene ke liye sidhe taur par graahakon ke conection unke aadhaar card or bank acount number ke saath jod rahi he, vahiin gas companiyaan or unki agency sabhi kanoono ko taakh par rakhkar manamaani kar rahe hai
 Customers are quite upset by this action of agencies
 haalanki petroleum or prakritik gas mantralay dwaara is tarah kii koi patibaddhta nahin lagaai gai he ki agar graahak aadhaar card or bank acount number nahin jamaa karaata to uskaa conection band kar diya jayega
 This whole process is being done by the government only to subsidize and prevent LPG black marketing, due to which the bank account number of customers and Aadhar card will have to be deposited by 31st March
 iske alaava gres period dete hue ye avadhi kuch badhaai bhi ja sakati he par gas conection band nahin kiye jaaenge
 Despite all these things, the gas agencies closed many thousands of connections from December and January, and customers were forced to ask for bank accounts and Aadhaar cards, which the employees of these agencies themselves have accepted

 NCP chief Sharad Pawar told the assembled mlas on Monday night that he would personally ensure that no one gets membership if he votes against the BJP during the power test in the Maharashtra Assembly
 pavaar mumbai main paanch sitara hotel main shivasena, rakanpa or congress ke ‘maha vikaas aghadi' ke 162 vidhayakon kii sanyukt baithak ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Pawar said, "misinformation is being spread that Ajit Pawar is the leader of the NCP Legislature Party, who will issue a whip to all (NCP) mlas to vote for the BJP (in the power test)
" ''rakanpa pramukh ne kaha ki unhone kai samvidhan visheshgyon or kanoon visheshgyon se vichaar- vimarsh kiya he or purv ke muddon par bhi gaur kiya he
 Pawar said, "I have come to the conclusion that Ajit Pawar who has been removed from his post (leader of NCP Legislature Party due to joining hands with BJP to form government), has no issue of whip to mlas Is not a legal authority
 ''paroksh taur par bhaajapa kaa hawala dete hue pavaar ne kaha, ‘‘main nijee taur par jimmedaari letaa hum ki sadan se aapaki sadsyta nirast nahin hogi
 Those illegally occupying power must now withdraw
 '' On 26 May 2014, three years of the Modi government took over the reins of the country
 desh hi nahin videshon main bhi modi ke naam kaa danka baj rahaa he
 The people of the country are happy with the policies and style of Modi and the opposition parties are silent
 aisa lagata he ki vipakshiyon ko intjaar he modi lahar ke sthir hone kaa, lekin tamaam jhanjhavaton ke bich bhi modi lahar khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahi he
 Full coverage: 3 years of Modi government, in fact, today, three years of Modi government have passed, the opposition got weaker year after year
 pichley teen saalon main modi ne apni chhavi itani badi kar lee he ki unke samakaksh bijepi kaa koi netaa najar nahin aata
 The party, known as Atal and Advani, is now Modi's
 jaahir he samay ek sa nahin rahata lekin kya bijepi main modi kaa koi vikalp he yaa uski sambhaavna he
 Aajtak on similar issues when Modi government completes three years
 in ke editor panini anand ne apni raay vyakt kii
 Add a look 
 
 raajnneeti kii bisaat par modiap bhale hi modi kii vichaardhaara se sahamat na hon lekin raajnneetik rup se modi ne apane saare virodhiyon ke daant khattey karte hue khud ko ek aitihaasik oonchai par pahunchaaya he
 This achievement of Modi is also an achievement of BJP
 modi se zyada sweekaarya chehre bijepi main rahe hai lekin modi jaisi raajnneetik safalataa pehle kisi gair-congressi netaa kii shaayad hi rahi ho
 Three years after the Modi government, where Modi stands, the bjp's imagination was not possible without Modi
 kamjor vipaksh na modi ke liye acha, na loktantr ke lieshakti satta kaa swabhaav hoti he
 If this nature removes accountability and criticism, then this nature becomes dictator
 kisi bhi loktantr ke liye mahatvapurn he ki aalochana or javabdehi kii gunjaaish hameshaa bani rahe
 Three years later, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is standing
 us samay main hindustan main vipaksh kii sthiti behad kharaab he
 This is neither good for Narendra Modi nor for democracy
 kya bijepi ke paas modi kaa vikalp he?modi kaa udai or teen saal kaa kaamkaaj bhale hi modi ke liye or bijepi ke liye ek svarnim samay ho, lekin isi party ke liye santhnik rup se yah samay kai tarah ke sawaalon ko bhi apane garbh main samete hue he
 Although the BJP will be seen to be gleaming in the fever of victory, but the party which views the idea as bigger than the person and the organization is bigger than the leadership, has now become a one-man power
 santhnik vikaas kii drushti se yah bahut acchhee sthiti nahin he
 The BJP does not have Jannayak as an alternative to Modi and whose army is running the party today, it is useless to expect Modi's charisma to be repeated
 uttar pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav kii taarikh ko nae saal ke pehle hafte main ghoshit kiye jane kaa kayaas lag rahaa tha

 5
 beete do din se machi nai kalah ke baad se team pike lagaataar mukhyamantri akhilesh ke sampark main bani hui he
 6
 team pike kaa daawa he ki vah akhilesh ko samaajawaadee party kii image se alag karne kii koshish main the
 7
 lakhanu se lekar dilli tak ke siyaasi galiyare main kayaas lagaaya ja rahaa he ki ab akhilesh ke liye nai party banane kaa rasta saaf ho chukaa he
 8 There is no denying the possibility that Chief Minister Akhilesh will join Congress with his team and try to win more than 300 seats in the upcoming assembly elections
 9
 Amid the ongoing discord for the last two days, Congress state in-charge Ghulam Nabi Azad is camping in Lucknow and informing the party high command moment by moment

 Akhilesh's exercise is to counter the bjp's influence and the Modi wave by going public with his corruption-free and clean image of the last 5 years

 Sources close to Azad said that despite having a diplomatic passport, he was prevented from boarding the plane and questioned by security agencies

 The cji's order for investigation in the Justice Tahilramani case should be based on the investigation IB report: Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi gave green signal to CBI to investigate the corruption charges against former Chief Justice VK Tahilramani of the CJI Gogoimdras High Court
 Has flagged CJI ne kaha he ki kanoon ke mutabik agency jaanch aage badha sakati he
 CJI Gogoi has asked the investigating agency CBI to take action according to law in the case of Justice VK Tahilramani
 jaanch ibi kii report ke aadhaar par hogi

 sadan ke andar bijepi se hamaare parshad jawaab maangate hai, lekin jawaab dene ke bajaae bijepi ke parshad sadan ke andar 'aap' ke parshadon ke saath marpet karte hai

 darasal haqakeet yah he ki bijepi ke saare bhrashtachar main congress unki baraabar kii bhagidaar he

 In such a situation, AAP councilors have accused BJP of hooliganism
 saath hi BJP parshadon ke khilaaf police shikaayat or mahila ayog main shikaayat kii baat bhi kahi he
 The victim 'AAP' female councilor Krishnavati, who was present at the press conference, said that if we expose the corruption of BJP leaders in the corporation, then BJP leaders threaten us

 The Delhi government has reserved half the beds for Delhi chemists at GB Pant Hospital
 pachaas fisadi bed reserve karne ke peeche dilli sarkaar kii daleel he ki bahari marizon kii vajah se dilli waalon ko ilaaj nahin mil paa rahaa he
 At the same time, BJP sitting in opposition did not like this formula of government
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne kaha ki sarkaar apni naakaami chupaane ke liye marizon ko bhi baant rahi he
 Tiwari said that the government has implemented this formula only to hide its shortage, because in the last two and a half years, the government has not opened any new hospital in Delhi
 maujuuda aspataalon main bistaron kii sankhya nahin badhaai gai, jabaki aam aadmi party ne apane ghoshnaa patr main is baat ko jor shor se uthaaya tha
 She failed in it
 ab dilli ke aspataalon main dilli waalon ke liye pachaas fisadi siten arakshit kar apane nakaaraapan ko chupaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Tiwari alleged that Arvind Kejriwal just wants to take the sympathy of the voters by talking to the people, hence making such decisions to gain cheap popularity
 sirf aam aadmi kaa nuksaan hona he, kyonki mariz jarurat ke vakt aspataal aata he
 He needs treatment, so if his address will be asked before treatment, it will be a matter of increasing his suffering
 bijepi ne kejariwal sarkaar se maang kii he ki wo apni kamiyaan chupaane ke bajaae unhen puraa karne kaa prayaas karen
 For this, the need is not to implement reservations in hospitals, but to increase facilities in hospitals
 gauratlab he ki dilli ke swasthyamantri satyendra jaine ne sarkaar ke faisle kaa bachaav karte hue daleel di he ki dilli ke aspataalon main baahar ke marijon kii taadaad sattar se assi fisadi tak ho gai he
 Due to this Delhi people are not getting treatment
 haalanki dilli sarkaar ke aspataalon main kaam rahe doctoron ne bhi is faisle ko lekar hairaani jataai he
 On the condition of anonymity, a doctor at GB Pant Hospital said that most of the patients are from Delhi and the government has taken this decision without knowing the hospital's data, in such a case the patients will be harmed

 On the other hand, if Kushwaha separates from NDA, BJP and JDU will contest 17-17 seats, while Lok Janshakti Party will fight on 6 seats

 The dispute between Infosys founders and the company's board of directors came to light on Friday
 company ke sah sansthaapak narayan murti ne kaaryakariyon ke vetan tathaa kaamkaaj ke sanchaalan ko lekar sawaal khadaa kiya he
 Vishal Sikka is the country's second largest software services exporter
 murti ne kaha, ‘main yah saaf kar dena chahta hum ki prabandhan mujhe chintit nahin kar rahaa he
 i think we are happy with CEO Sikka
 vah acha kaam kar rahe hai
 However, some of us, such as the founders, superiors and those previously associated with Infosys, are worried that there are some things in governance that could have been done better
 ’ Murthy and two other co-founders Nandan Nilekani and s Gopalakrishnan are understood to have written a letter to the company's board of directors asking why the salary of Sikka was increased and the two top executives leaving the company were given such a heavy package of separation
 The 48 as basic salary, bonus and benefits to the coin last year
 7 karod rupee die gaye
 At the same time, his basic salary in the partial period of 2015 was 4
 5 karod rupee tha
 Murthy also questioned the former CFO Rajiv Bansal being given Rs 23 crore as a 30-month package to break away from the company
 murti ne ek nijee samachar channel se kaha ki infosis main do siefo the jo company chhod gaye the
 There were other senior people on the board such as the senior vice president, etc
, who had such competitive information, but we did not pay them anything
 isse kuch asamanjas kii sthiti paidaa hui he
 There is speculation in the market that this payment was made to Bansal because he had information about the damage to Infosys, Murthy said, "I hope that is not the case
" tippaniyan He said former executives Mohan Das Pai, Ashok Vemuri, v Balakrishnan and BG Srinivas were never given a package to break away from the company
 infosis ne haalanki gavarnence main khaamiyon ko khaarij kiya he
 Infosys chairman r Sheshasayi said the board has complete harmony with the strategic direction of Vishal Sikka

 7 crores was given
 vahiin 2015 kii aanshik avadhi main unka mul vetan 4
 5 crores was Rs
 murti ne purv siefo rajeev bansal ko company se alag hone ke liye 30 maah ke package ke rup main 23 karod rupee die jane par bhi sawaal uthaaya
 Murthy told a private news channel that Infosys had two cfos who left the company
 board main anya varisht log masalan varisht upaadhyaksh aadi the, jinke paas aisi pratispardhi suchanaaen thim, lekin hamane unhen kuch bhugtan nahin kiya tha
 This has led to some confusion
 bazaar main is tarah kii atakalein hai ki bansal ko yah bhugtan isliye kiya gaya kyonki unke paas infosis ko nuksaan pahunchane ke bare main soochna thi, murti ne kaha ki main ummid karata hum ki yah maamla nahin ho
 The comments unhone kaha ki purv kaaryakariyon mohan das pai, ashok wemuri, ve baalkrishnan or bi ji shrinivas ko kabhi company se alag hone ke liye package nahin diya gaya
 Infosys, however, has ruled out flaws in governance

 It started with the Goa Forward Party (GFP), which demanded the installation of a statue of Jack Sequeira in the assembly complex
 1967 main goa ke maharashtra main vilay ko rokane main jaik kii mahatvapurn bhoomika thi
 Congress legislators supported it, but the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party wanted to place a statue of socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia there
 bhaajapa vidhayak yahaan chhatrapati shivaji kii pratimaa lagane ke pakshdhar hai
 GFP leader and state town planning minister Vijay Sardesai emphasized that it is necessary to honor Sequeira to maintain Goa's identity
 1967 main unki pahal par hi goa ke logon ne maharashtra main vilay kii jagah centreshasit pradesh bane rahane ke liye vot diya tha
 Both the BJP and the MGP had earlier accepted the proposal that the state's first Chief Minister Dayanand Bandodkar's statue was installed in the assembly complex and no other statue was needed
 lekin jab dipti spikar maaikel lobo (bhaajapa) or purv mukhyamantri churchill alemao (jieffpi) ne sequeira kii pratimaa lagane kii maang kaa samarthan kiya to donon dalon ne ravaiya badal liya

 Sardesai, the leader of the GFP, says that first the MGP should remove the word 'maharashtra' from its name
 isse mukhyamantri manohar parrikar duvidha main hai
 They can neither oppose nor support the installation of Sequeira
 unki daleel bhi kamjor he ki ''ab or pratimaa nahin lagani chahie, kyonki inke rakrakhaav kaa kharch bahut zyada hota he

 sawaal poochne ke liye unke saath the oe efem ke aaraje lucky
 But Sunil himself was so busy with his words and act that he did not give much opportunity to ask questions
 sunil se baatcheet ke dauraan hi baba ramdev ne sho main entry lee to gutthi ne unhen bhi nahin choda
 Read full conversation: My childhood started with a cycle, then reached the bus train and the plane
 ek baar helicopter main bhi baitha hum
 i am from a small town called Mandi Dabwali
 vahaan par badi sari gutthiyaan hoti hai
 From there came to Chandigarh to do graduation
 tab main hamelet play karata tha
 Serial used to play
 magar roj shaam ko phani mimicri karata tha
 i have learned most of the act from my relatives
 college main tha, to jeb main kam paise hote the
 At that time, i called my maternal uncle living in Malot, a city in Punjab
 un dinon astidi ke meter chalate the
 Mami picked up the phone
 unhone jis andaaj main baat kii
 i caught it and started using it in comedy
 vaise hi ek sharaabi tha, pavanaa, jisaki acting ke chakkar main main pita bhi
 He used to feed Golgappa during the day
 shaam ko sharaab pikar khambhe se baaten karata tha
 He used to say that i have come to marry you
 to inhen sab kairactors ko main apane ghar kii shaadiyon main act karata tha or log dekhakar khub hansate the
 How Gutthi Ji is no longer a bulb, that he tried and became three thousand times
 objaraveshan se hi bana
 The college i was in
 vahaan 4300 ladke the or 7 ladkiyaan
 4 out of 7 did not attend college
 bachiin sirf 3
 So hundreds would have seen the same girl
 ek koi ladki dhokhe se agar rigelt bhi puch leti, to bande kii phoonk bad jaati
 So there was such an atmosphere
 unheen ladakiyon ko dekhakar main bada hua hum
 She became the biggest group
 kaise karte hai kamedimujhe kamedi kerani nahin aati
 Telling the truth main sirf apane aasapaas ke kirdaaron kaa objrv karata hum
 Someone with a camera, someone with a job, someone with an aunt
 to unheen sabase milakar ban jaati he kamedi
 What i like best is to enter the character's heart
 yahi mere liye meditation he yahi acting
 It is a lot of fun
 ramdev or gutthi kii mithi nonkjhokaisi bich baba ramdev ne lee sho main entry to sunil unase baat karne lage or baat karte-karte manch se neeche utar unke paas tak pahunch gaye
 He said to Baba Ramdev, 'I am your fan, he says you will do yoga
 ye nahin bataate kya hoga
 Just say that it will happen
 'sunil ne baba ramdev se khub majaak kiya
 He asked them if they watch TV? On this Ramdev said, 'not much, but i listen to news on TV
 news channel se hi pataa chalaa ki aap gutthi kaa kirdaar karte hai
 i don't know what the knot means
 maine ye bhi suna tha ki aapane kam paisa milane kii vajah se sho chhod diya
 Sunil then came on stage at the call of the moderator and asked Baba Ramdev if he would like to hear the joke? Sunil also offered a sample of his characters 'sud' and 'vicky Chadha'

 bhartiya janata party (BJP) assam main rashtriya naagarik register (NRC) ke jariye loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main purvattar ke rajyon main maahaul banaakar badi jeet kaa khwab dekh rahi thi
 But the way Arunachal has become tense due to opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Bill and now Permanent Resident Certificate (PRC) just before the election
 is virodh kii aanch main bijepi ke jeet ke mansoobey jhulaste hue najar aa rahe hai
 Explain that in Arunachal Pradesh, people are angry and giving violence on the street against giving certificates to 6 communities outside the state to be permanent residents
 pradarshkariyon ne upmukhyamantri ke ghar main aag laga di he
 The state government has come on the backfoot over the issue of Permanent Resident Certificate (PRC) amid growing opposition
 PRC ab bijepi ke liye gale kii haddi banataa ja rahaa he
 The Lok Sabha has a total of 25 seats in all the northeastern states, on which the BJP has a special focus
 maujuuda samay main bijepi ke paas purvottar kii 8 siten hai
 Since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has paid special attention to the states of the Northeast
 isi kaa nateeja he ki bijepi ne purvottar ko 'congress mukt' kar diya he
 At the same time, in the northeastern states, the BJP is running the government itself or as an ally
 darasal bijepi loksabhaa chunaav main uttar or pashchim bharat main hone vaale sambhavit nuksaan kii bharpai purvottar ke rajyon ke jariye karnaa chaahati he
 But the way protests have arisen in the Northeast, the bjp's plan seems to be a big shock
 darasal assam main NRC kii masauda suchi jari hone ke baad avaidh ghuspaithiyon kii samasya se jujh rahe purvottar ke tamaam rajyon dwaara unke rajya main NRC lagu karne kii maang hone lagi thi
 This move of the BJP government at the center got tremendous support
 bataa den ki bangladesh se aae muslim ghuspaithiyon ko desh kii suraksha ke liye khatra bataa kar bijepi is mudde ko bhavnatmak rup dekar maahaul banaati rahi he
 At the same time, the BJP in its manifesto promised to give citizenship to Hindu refugees coming to India after suffering persecution in neighboring countries in these elections
 lekin naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak or sthaayee nivasee pramaan patr ko lekar virodh ke sur jis tarah uthe hai
 They are making the BJP restless
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak ko lekar purvottar ke tamaam rajyon main log or kshetreey dal virodh main khadey ho gaye
 However, most of these regional parties are running the government in their respective states of the Northeast in collaboration with the BJP
 isi kaa nateeja tha ki naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak loksabhaa se paas hone ke baavjood rajyasabha se paas nahin ho sakaa he
 While Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also started the exercise to create an electoral atmosphere regarding the Citizenship Amendment Bill, the BJP has pulled back due to protests in the Northeast
 assam main 14 loksabhaa siten hai, jinamein se bijepi ko 2014 main saat siten mili thim
 The BJP is working on a plan to do a thorough clean sweep in Assam in the 2019 election
 piarsi ke jariye bijepi ne arunachal hi nahin balki assam ko bhi saadhane ke maddenjar bada daanv chalaa tha, lekin yah daanv uske gale kii haddi ban gaya he
 The Joint High Powered Committee (JHPC) has recommended the grant of local resident certificates to six communities who are not originally from Arunachal Pradesh but hail from Assam
 lekin dashakon se namsai or changlang jilon main rah rahe hai
 These include Deoris, Sonowal Kachari, Morans, Adivasis, Mishing and Gorkhas
 inhen assam main anusuchit jati kaa darj mila hua he
 In such a situation, the government had made a move to give them permanent resident certificate in Arunachal, but due to protest they had to withdraw it
 aatank kii duniya main 'white vido' naam se kukhyat muslim mahila ne alqaida network ke maare gaye mukhiya osama bin laden ko apana sabase sachcha pyaar bataaya he

 yun to 'white vido' kii kavita main ssailing sambandhi galatiyon kii bharmaar he, iske baavjood iskaa majamoon logon kaa dhyaan apni ore khinchne ke liye kaaphi he
 The British police found this woman's poem from a computer hard drive
 computer kenya ke shahar mombasa ke ek ghar baraamad hua
 The poem reads: 'O Sheikh Osama My Father, My Brothermai Love For You Is Like No Other Sheikh Osama Now That You Are Gond Muslims Must Wake Up The Must Be Standing
 'is kavita main alqaida ke or majboot hone kii kaamana kii gai he
 In this, many blessings have been sought from God, describing him as almighty
 dilachasp baat yah he ki kavita main america raashtrapati baraak obama ke bare main likhaa gaya ki unki koi jeet nahin hui thi (der vaaj no victory for you mistar obama)
 The bloody game played at the behest of White Widow in Nairobi's mall is that Al Qaeda terrorist Osama bin Laden was killed by the US military in May 2011 by running an operation in Pakistan
 darasal, 7 july, 2005 ko 4 islamic aatankiyon ne landan ke transport network par aatmghaatee hamalaa kar diya tha
 52 innocent people lost their lives in this attack
 'white vido' isi hamale main shaamil ek aatanki kii vidhwaa hai
 Last month itself, there was an attack in a shopping mall in Nairobi, killing 67 people
 iske baad kenya kii sarkaar se interpol se 'white vido' ko giraftaar karne ke liye anurodh bheja tha
 Interpol then sent a red corner notice
 kenya ke adhikariyon kii maane, to nairobi ke mal main khun-kharabe ke puure oparation kii aguwai ek white mahila ne kii, jiskaa naam he- samantha luthewat yani 'white vido'
 Who is 'white Widow' In the world of terror, Samantha Luthweight is known by the name 'white Widow'
 ye gori mahila africa desh main maut kaa khel khilne main maahir hai
 In 2005, the 7th of July
 tab landan dahal uthaa tha
 There was a massive explosion in the 'tube' ie the metro
 isi dhamaake main maare gaye aatanki kii bevaa hai 'white vido'
 In 2011, 6 years after the incident, it was revealed that she was living in Mombasa, Kenya
 6 saalon main luthewat ne aatank kii duniya main apni khaas pahchaan bana lee
 Gradually her relationship became associated with Somalia's terrorist organization Al Shabaab
 dilachasp baat yah he ki al shabaab se judane ke baad samantha sheraphia ban chuki hai

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is again in Bundelkhand
 is baar vah apni kisaan yatra lekar bundelkhand aae hai
 Here he is spending more than a week
 rahul lagaataar kisaanon ke bich hai
 From the debt waiver to halting the electricity bill, the farmers of Bundelkhand are interacting with each other, but a question is arising that where are the farmers of Bundelkhand with whom Rahul Gandhi spent many nights in the villages before? Have been 'aaj tak' team ne janaa kisaanon kaa halajhansi ke medki gaanv memrahul gandhi ne2011 main ek puri raat guzari thi
 a poor farmer came to Key Cody's house
 parivaar ke saath khaanaa bhi khaaya tha
 The 'aaj Tak' team again visited the same family and the same village where Rahul Gandhi was supposed to visit the farmers
 kunjee kodi ke parivaar ne aaj bhi un tasveeron ko jatan se rakhaa he, jisamen rahul parivaar ke bich baithe hai
 Listening to their words rahul ke baad gaanv nahin aayaa congress kaa koi netamedki ke kunjee kodi kaa parivaar congressi rahaa he
 Key Kodi is no more, but his family is still here
 rahul gandhi ne is parivaar ko madad di, jab kunjee kodi cancer se jujh rahe the
 On the other hand, if the farmers of Italy are to be believed, there has been an improvement in their condition with the arrival of Rahul
 na to sarkaar ne koi madad di or na hi congress kaa koi netaa hi unki sud lene aayaa
 People are sure that the Congress government will not form, people have said that where was Rahul Gandhi when the farmer here was facing drought for the last four years
 gaanv main aakar rahul tehre to jarur lekin iskaa phayda gaanv ko kabhi nahin mila
 Even if it has a firehul Gandhi comilla, nothing has been done for the farmer
 gaanv ke zyaadaatar kisaan is baat se khush jarur hai ki rahul karj maafee kaa mudda lekar chal rahe hai
 Despite this, they are not sure that this debt can be forgiven
 kyonki sabhi maanate hai ki sarkaar congress kii nahin hi banane vaali he

 The instant messaging app works on whatsapp end to end encryption, which is considered to be the most secure
 na sirf whatsapp balki duusare instent miseging ap Telegram main bhi and tu and ancripshan he
 Although it was already in Telegram
 phir bhi media files surakshit nahin hai
 Symantec is a cyber security firm
 isane ek tarika bataaya he jisase havers kuch khatarnaak ap ko yuj karke media files main ched chhaad kar sakate hai or isse bhej kar aapkaa nuksaan bhi kar sakate hai
 Apps on Android smartphones use internal or external storage to save any media files, such as photo and audio files
 ye aam practice he, yani zyaadaatar android eps ke saath aisa hi hota he
 Talking about whatsapp, this by default only stores media files in external storage
 kuch isi tarah kaa feechar Telegram main bhi he
 Researchers have said that in this case, media files of whatsapp and Telegram can be accessed by sending malware to external storage
 udhaaharan ke taur par kisi yujar kii memory card main khartarnak files hai, jise aap virus bhi kah sakate hai
 Now someone sent a photo to you on whatsapp, a hacker can easily make some changes in the photo sent on this whatsapp and you will not have any information about it
 koi haikar agar chaahe to bheje gaye massej main bhi ched chhaad kar saktaa he
 This is called media file file jacking
 is tarah ke atake duusare eps main bhi hote hai jinamein external storage kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 a statement from whatsapp has also come about this
 company ne kaha he ki storage system ko change karke isse bachaa ja saktaa he
 The company has said that this issue has been closely watched and the company will fix it with the upcoming Android update
