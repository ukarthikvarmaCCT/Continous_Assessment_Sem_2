 After doing a lot of politics on demonetisation, the Delhi government has now made up its mind for an administrative shutdown
 dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne twit kiya ki modi sarkaar kii notebandi kii badaulat is maheene sarkari karmchaariyon ko selary de paanaa mushkil he
 By now, you must have seen Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet ministers doing politics against demonetisation from Parliament to the street, but now the Delhi government has come down on administrative shutdown citing demonetization as the reason
 aisa ham nahin kah rahe, khud dilli ke upmukhyamantrimanish sisodiyaapane twit ke jariye ye baat kah rahe hai
 Manish Sisodia said on Twitter, 'there is no business left in Delhi markets
 lihaaja is maheene tex collection 50 fisadi tak kam ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, it will be difficult for the government employees to be paid
 'sisodiyaka itnaa bolnaa tha ki bijepi ne chhutate hi hamalaa bolaa
 Leader of Opposition in the Vidhan Sabha Vijender Gupta said that even before the demonetisation, the Delhi government had reduced revenue
 pichley vittiya varsh main to sarkaar apane lakshya tak bhi nahin pahunch pai thi, tab to notebandi thi bhi nahin
 Therefore, it is better that the Kejriwal government focus on tax collection instead of making excuses
 bataa den, 2015-16 main bhi kejariwal sarkartax collection kaa targetpar ran out ho gai thi
 Therefore, there is no doubt that if the Delhi government is not able to give salary to government employees, then some other excuse has to be found for this
 sarkaar se is baat kii apeksha jarur hoti he ki prashasan or raajnneeti main buniyadi fark wo samaj kar chale

 Modi said, there are many states where the Congress will not even be able to open its account
 kisi bhi rajya main congress ko dahaai ank main seat hasil nahin hogi
 This time it will get a seat in single digits in Congress-ruled states

 sutron kii maane to priyanka modi ko takkar dene main icchhuk thim par ain maukey par congress haikaman ne unhen chunavi raajnneeti main nahin utaarne kaa faisla kiya
 So far, Priyanka, who was confined to her brother Rahul and mother Sonia Gandhi's parliamentary constituencies Amethi and Rae Bareli, believed that Narendra Modi would have to be stopped for the country
 anumaan tha ki priyanka ke chunaav ladane se desh bhar main modi ke tuphaani chunaav prachaar ko simit kiya ja saktaa tha
 Apart from this, this decision worked to revive party workers and supporters, even when many senior leaders are hesitating to enter the election summer for fear of defeat

 It starts with faculty
 iity kii pariksha ke liye iity graduate or medical pravesh parikshaon ke liye ucch sansthaanon se paas embibies
 Some institutes, such as Career Point, even hold entrance exams for faculty
 yahaan shikshakon kaa vetan itane zyada hota he ki log korporate jagat kii acchhee naukariyaan chhodkar padhaane lag jate hai
 Take, for example, Saransh Gupta, who was ranked 41st in the 2006 IIT-JEE
 iity-mumbari se 2010 main snaatak karne ke baad unhen goldman sex main naukari mili lekin teen saal baad ve naukari chhodkar kota aa gaye or alan kariyar institute main physics padhaane lage

 All students start studying at the same level at the time of admission
 iske baad rivyuu test liye jate hai or unamem pradarshan ke aadhaar par chaatro ko alag-alag baichon main baant diya jaataa he
 The names of batches are A0, A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, B2, B3 etc
 sabhi baichon main shikshan kaa tarika bhinn hota he
 For example, a student of A0 batch does not need much support because he can practice at home, but students from below batch need more guidance
 yah rivyuu test har 45 din par hota he jiskaa nateeja abhibhavakon ko bheja jaataa he or unase is bare main baat bhi kii jaati he
 Methods of teaching are also constantly evolving
 masalan, alan main chaatro ke liye ek online plateform he jiskaa naam sisat (systemetic analysis of test for classroom students) he
 It is a detailed analysis of children's performance which can also be seen by their parents
 isamen alag-alag sawaalon ke aadhaar par ek report hoti he or ek khand aisa hota he, jahaan chaatr ke ankon kii tulana toparon ke saath kii jaati he
 Now Android app has also come for this on Google Playstore
 isaki tagaline kahati he- “tu em ij note enf, you must hit” (sirf nishaanaa sadhana hi paryaapt nahin he&nishaanaa laganaa bhi chahie)
 Private-level guidance is the key to this teaching for students whom faculty consider to be potential toppers

 The consignment was to be supplied to Neeraj Gupta

 When someone goes to the police with a complaint, the police ask them whether the GPS is placed in the car or not, if it is installed then find it yourself and otherwise, luck will be found

 Musharraf also believed in an interview that the ISI used Haqqani's influence to liberate Pakistan's ambassador to Afghanistan, who had been kidnapped and held hostage by Baitullah Mehsud's terrorist organization tehreek-e-taliban
 purv pakistani raashtrapati ne kaha ki hakkaani jaisaa ki aaj ham jaanate hai vah shaks he jiskaa asar khatarnaak aatankwaadi batulla mahsood par he jo dakshin wajiristaan ko sabase khoonkhaar commander or benazir bhutto kaa hatyara he
 Musharraf said that Mehsud abducted our ambassador in Kabul and our intelligence agency used Haqqani's influence for his release

 The intelligence service uses certain enemies against some other enemies
 or sabhi ko ek saath dushman bana lene se behatar he ki ek ke baad duusare se nibata jaae
 When the Pakistani president was asked about these US media reports that the ISI planned the Taliban support, Musharraf said intelligence agencies always had access to other networks

 unka yah bhi aarope tha ki bhartiya khufia agency balooch vidrohiyon ko hathiyaar de rahen hai or unka vittaposhan kar rahe hai
 The former Pakistani President also said that there are many Indian extremists who are militants in Pakistan
 musharraf ne daawa kiya ki agar duniya aatankwaad se nibatane ke maamle main gambhir he to unhen bharat ko nahin chhodana chahie kyonki pakistan ke maujuuda halaat ke peeche ek bhartiya tatv he

 According to him, the GDP growth rate in the coming years is 6 instead of 7 percent

 In such a situation, if the rupee falls below it, it will break down to 70 rupees per dollar
 ye he vajah:rupee main aane vaale dinon main bhi dabaav bana rahegaa
 This pressure is attributed to continued strength in the dollar, decrease in foreign investment flows and rising crude oil prices
 inaki vajah se hi rupaya 70 ke str par pahunch saktaa he
 According to bankers, if the rupee reaches the level of 70, it will not be a good situation for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

 The most difficult challenges of the time are those that have creative thinking and the ability to take risks
 samaaj ke sabase upree tabake main gine chune yahi ve dabadabe vaale log hai jo apane peshey kii hadon se bhi baahar nikalakar ek bade manch par takat kii patakatha likhte hai
 They are the most different and their performance is driven by money and brains, ideas and attitudes

 The eleventh edition of India Today's list of high and influential people gives a glimpse of their defeat and, as before, still dominates the emperors of the market

 However, today there is no government in the country that is providing the ideal environment for development, but rather there is a government which does not have any far-reaching economic thinking
 isliye bharat ke udhyami varg kii safalataa vyaktigat saahas or abhinav soch kii dein he or vah bhi aise mulk main jo loktantr kii sabase buree aadaton yani ek se adhik satta kendron or naukarshahi ke makadzaal se trast he

 Despite this, not every representative of the industry included in the list of high and influential people can be called impolite or respected
 inamen se zyaadaatar kaa naitikta se bahut vaasta nahin or kuch ko to system kaa laabh mila he
 There is no dearth of celebrities in India who are fast-pacing the steps of corruption, who are able to meet the needs of both the board room and the court room in a smooth manner
 satta yaa shakti ke saath hameshaa naitikta or maryaadaaon kaa sambandh ho yah katai jaruri nahin
 Just below the business world are the kings of the media and their story is absolutely Indian, that too in a world where news is not the most salable item

 They are going to match the touchscreen generation of the West, yet they have not left the reality
 purana media bazaar hi bharat ke media ke baadshahon kii balanceshit ko sahaara detaa he
 Nevertheless, they are proving to be a master of market ethics and earning profits simultaneously

 The biggest show is Indian democracy itself, although entertainment from it is becoming more and more dangerous for the health of the country
 raajnneetik satta ke mansoobon or galat iraadon kaa virodh hi loktantr ko pranavayu de rahaa he
 These voices of discontent are sometimes heard and seen at intersections or on prime time television, or seem to be daunting from the editorial pages of newspapers
 virdohi swaron kii yah shakti aaj is suchi main kahin zyada mukhar he
 The axis of power has also changed
 shaasha, senapati or kaarobaari kaa jo trikon kal tak paaramparik satta pratishthan ko paribhaashit karata tha, ab vah khule samaajon or vaishvikaran kii aandhi main kahin gum hota ja rahaa he
 India Today's list of high and influential people has also made it to those who have become Kundan in one of the most blazing furnaces of democracy

 This struggle of always being at the forefront of the world has taken the form of the story of twenty-first century India in the next 50 pages of power

 This story is based on Rabindranath Tagore, in which the struggle of today's women will be shown in today's society
 is naatak ko dekhne ke baad shilpa aakhri faisla lengi jo ki munmai main 18 march ko hone vaala he
 Actually, these days, Shilpa is seeing the market of female-oriented films growing
 yahi vajah he ki shilpa bhi apni vaapasi kisi aisi hi film se karnaa chaahati hai, jo unhen safalataa or surkhiyaan de kyonki shilpa kaa filmi safar kareeb 10 saal pehle hi ruk chukaa tha
 The comments shilpa ne bataur nirmaataa 2014 main film 'dhishkiaun' banaai thi, jo puri tarah fail ho gai thi
 In 2008, Shilpa was in just one song in the film Dostana

 After watching this drama, Shilpa will take the final decision which is going to be held on March 18 in Mumbai

 The way Pakistan and Sri Lanka started the ICC World Cup-2019, it was not felt that these teams would be able to do anything special, but in their second match, both these teams returned to the winning path and told that the improvement in performance Can happen at any time

 Ten years ago, a Serbian newspaper had even alleged that Colinda had acted in a pornographic film
 Later, like most rumors, it was a false story! (picture of Siberian newspaper) Kolynda gruber-kitarovic became not only the oldest working President of Croatia but she was also the first woman to reach this chair

 maharashtra ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ne congress netaa digvijay singh ko manahani kaa kanoonee notice bheja he
 Digvijay accused Fadnavis of nepotism in the SRA case
 vakil ganesh sowani ne bataaya ki fadanvis kii ore se unhone digvijay singh ko siem ke khilaaf manahanikaarak twits ko lekar notice bheja he
 Alleging that the wife's bank was benefited, senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh said in her tweet, "mumbai's SRA headed by the Chief Minister of Maharashtra has officially told all SRA developers that they are the Worli branch of Axis Bank Open your bank account in kya aap jaanate hai, aisa kyon? shrimati fadanvis exis bank kii upaadhyaksh hai
 To benefit private bank Axis Bank

 Height of Nepotism! - digvijaya singh (@ digvijaya_28) March 18, 2016 Interestingly, CM Fadnavis recently gave clarification on the matter, despite which Digvijay tweeted
 gauratlab he ki fadanvis ke netritv vaale jhuggi punarvaas praadhikaran (esare) ne 10 farvari ko ek aadesh jari kiya tha, jisamen developers ko nirdesh diya gaya ki ve yogyata rakhane vaale jhuggivaasiyon ko 15 farvari 2016 yaa usase pehle kiraye ke bhugtan ke liye dakshin mumbai main exis bank kii varali shakha main apane bank khate kaa byoraa saunpen
 The Chief Minister had given clarification
 After coming to the notice, Fadnavis had said in the clarification that no rules have been violated and this decision has nothing to do with his wife, who is an officer in the bank
 esare aadesh main kaha gaya tha ki agar developers nijee bank kii shakha ko byoraa saunpane main vifal rahe to unpar paanch lakh rupee tak kaa jurmaana lagaaya jayega
 The entire session of Parliament this time lost the separate Telangana issue
 or to or, bharat ke itihaas main pehali baar rail bajet loksabhaa main padhaa na ja sakaa
 Even during the presentation of the interim budget, there was so much noise that many things were not heard
 har din hangaamaa or kaamkaaj main vyavdhaan
 Both sides remained adamant on their demands and barely a partition bill of Andhra Pradesh could be placed in the Parliament
 is bill main 34 sanshodhan the or kaaphi mashkkat ke baad hi ise pesh kiya ja sakaa
 It is obvious that the BJP has accepted this and this bill has been passed
 iske baad andhra pradesh ke vibhaajan kii kagaji prakriya puri ho jaaegi
 But again and again the question will arise that how the Congress tried to deal with this issue in such an immature manner
 ab telugana kaa mudda uske ji kaa janjaal kaise ban gaya?sidhaa kaaran he ki party ne na to doordarshita dikhaai or na hi usne vyaavhaarik kadam uthaaya
 Not only this, he decided to take advantage of this issue in elections, due to which there was so much noise in the last days of 15th Lok Sabha that the House was not in a position to run
 itani avyavashtha kabhi dekhi nahin gai
 Some mps behaved like goons in the House and spread as much chaos as possible
 sadan kii garima ko gahari chot lagi
 The Congress had openly demanded the division of the state in 1999 and had raised the issue on its own, but later it started to get away from it
 party ne us samay is mudde kaa raajnneetik phayda to uthaa liya, lekin baad main usne pruthak telugana kaa maamla dabaa dene kii koshish bhi kii
 As a result, the matter got complicated and the people of Seemandhra who were watching the spectacle till now, jumped into this movement to not let their kingdom be divided
 yahaan se ek arajak andolan kaa janm hua, jisamen vidhayak, saansad or yahaan tak ki mantri bhi kud pade
 This was a case that hurt the Congress a lot and would result in the Lok Sabha elections
 andhra pradesh ke vibhaajan ke bill ko bijepi ke samarthan se loksabhaa kii anumati mil gai he, lekin sawaal bana rahegaa ki congress ne is maamle ko itnaa kyon ghasita? kyon party ke sipahasalaron ne ise itani dur jane diya ki araajaktaa kii sthiti paidaa ho gai? jis mudde ko usne khud uthaaya, usase vah kyon baar-baar bhaagti rahi? On March 9, United Progressive Alliance (UPA) chairperson Sonia Gandhi thundered at the India Today Conclave in Mumbai, saying, "we will not let the BJP come to power in 2019
 '' virodhiyon ko to yah atiaatmavishvaas kii tarah jaan padaa, khaskar aise vakt main jab unki party mahaj teen rajyon or ek centre shasit pradesh main satta main rah gai he
 Even today Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the most charismatic political leader on the political plank and add to that the ruthless election machine that BJP President Amit Shah has built, the pair has won 12 new states in the last four years
 unhone nai sarhadon—jammu or kashmir, assam or tripura—main apana paracham laharaaya he
 In contrast, the Congress could not form a government despite emerging as the single largest party in Manipur, Goa and Meghalaya

 It is the sheer desperation of survival that has pushed even arch rivals towards mismatched alliances
 sonia ne yah daawa asal main aise vakt kiya he jab 2019 ke chunaavon se pehle aakhri nirnaayak saal ke pehle teen maheenon main ek ke baad ek teevr siyaasi ghatnaayen ghatit hui hai
 In January, the Shiv Sena, an ally of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), announced that it would contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections alone

 This reality added to the dramaticness that the BJP had never lost the Gorakhpur seat since 1989

 It is a matter of fact that they both have very different ambitions

 The Shiv Sena voiced it in its mouthpiece Saamana
 gorakhpur or phulpur kii haar par bhaajapa kii tikhi aalochana karte hue usne ek sampadakeey main aagaah kiya, "2019 main bhaajapa kii siten 280 nahin rahengi or ab yah saaf he ki inamen kam se kam 100 se 110 siton kii kami aegi
 "mamata's trusted lieutenant and TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek o'brien predicted," In Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Haryana, where the BJP currently has 69 seats, its seats will come down to 20
 ''chunavi kayaasabaaji or guna-bhaag kaa koi adarsh tarika nahin he
 Although the BJP won a majority on its own in 2014 (winning 282 seats out of a total of 543 Lok Sabha seats), its vote share was just 31 per cent
 itani kam vot hissedari ke saath kisi bhi party ne kabhi itani zyada siten nahin jiti thim; isse pehle sabase kam vot hissedari ke saath kisi ek party ne bahumat hasil kiya tha to vah 1967 main congress thi, jab usne kul daale gaye vaid maton ke 40
 It won 28 3 seats with 8 per cent
 zyada dilachasp baat yah he ki bhaajapa or congress kii milakar kul vot hissedari mahaj 50 fisadi se kuch hi zyada thi, jiskaa matlab he ki aadhe vot kisi duusari party ke liye the
 If the total combined vote share of the two big alliances is taken, the NDA is 38
 5 fisadi jabaki upie ko mahaj 23 fisadi se kuch kam vot mili the
 Even then, nearly 39 percent of the total votes — roughly equal to the vote share of the NDA — went to other parties
 lihaaja kaagajon par to upie or duusari partiyon kaa saath aana 2019 main modi ke vishalkay kafile ko roak saktaa he
 Not only this, the bjp's 31 per cent vote share in 2014 was the result of 50 per cent of the votes it got in five states (gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand) and more than 40 per cent of the votes in the other four states
 ab jab do bade sahyogi dal uskaa saath chhod chuke hai or in nau rajyon main 40 fisadi se zyada vot hasil karne ke jabardast pradarshan ko doharaa paane kii bahut hi kam sambhaavna he, aise main modi-shah kii jodi ke liye chijen mushkil dikhti hai
 An analysis of the 2014 results in terms of seats reveals the party's difficulties in 304 seats spread across 10 states
 ye ve rajya hai jahaan party bahut-se virdohi dalon ke khilaaf akele lard rahi hogi (dekhen vipaksh kaa ganit)
 Five years ago, when the opposition was scattered, it won 140 of these 304 seats
 inamen bhi 71 siten (kul 80 main se) akele uttar pradesh main thim
 If the SP and the BSP had fought together in 2014, they would have brought down the BJP seats in Uttar Pradesh to below 30

 Will the allies save the BJP? An investigation into the strength of the united opposition in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in four states where the BJP fought with the allies
 in rajyon kii 100 siton main se 29 bhaajapa jiti
 Also the picture of the vote shift in the subsequent assembly elections
 iske alaava chaar rajyon kii anya 100 siton par bhaajapa ek yaa zyada sahyogi dalon ke saath milakar vipakshi dalon kaa saamana karegi
 In 2014, it won 29 of these seats

 Two years later, the JD (U) chief and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar brought revenge and joined the BJP camp, although tensions are now beginning to be seen in this friendship as well
 arriya loksabhaa seat or jahanabad vidhansabha seat ke liye hue upachunaav main bhaajapa-jad(you ) gathbandhan kii haar ke baad nitish kumaar ne kaha ki unki party ne bhaajapa ke baari dabaav kii vajah se in muqablon main utarane kaa faisla kiya
 He said, "on the tremendous demand of the BJP, the party thought that if we did not listen to them, the blame would fall on us
" hamane acchhee tarah jaanate-boojhte hue ki kya hone vaala he, unki baat maani thi
 According to Professor Dwapayan Bhattacharya, who teaches political science at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, in 2019, the contest will be between the state's own particular resentment and resentment and the "insensitive" central BJP
 bhattacharya kehete hai, "iske sanket andhra pradesh, tamilnadu (stallin kii dravidiadu kii maang), karnataka (lingayaton ke liye alpsankhyak darja), maharashtra (kisaanon kaa virodh pradarshan) main dikhte hai
 The bjp's expansion plan has scared regional parties

 Due to which the alliance is expected to disintegrate before taking shape

 The anti-bjp votes will go strategically to the strongest party contesting the election
 '' nirnaayak ladaai alabatta rajasthan, gujarat, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, uttarakhand or himachal pradesh kii 100 siton par hogi, jahaan bhaajapa or congress main sidhaa muqabla hoga
 In 2014, the BJP won 97 of these seats
 bhaajapa ke andruni log bhi nijee taur par maanate hai ki rajasthan or madhya pradesh ke upachunaavon ke rujhaan ko dekhte hue ise doharaana naammumkin hi hoga
 In the last two years, Congress has won all the by-elections in Lok Sabha (2) and Vidhan Sabha (6) in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 bhattacharya kehete hai, "ekajute vipaksh or teen bade rajyon main congress kii haalat main sudhaar milakar pakkaa kar denge ki bhaajapa 200 ke paar na jaae
 "pachmail coalition"
 Though the figures indicate the difficulty of BJP, the politics is more than mere multiplication
 iskaa bahut kuch matlab chemistry bhi he or philhal koi ek netaa nahin he jo bikhare hue vipaksh ko ekajute kar sake
 Electoral mathematics also does not always guarantee success, like the RJD-JD (U) Congress Grand Alliance managed to keep the BJP out of power in Bihar in 2015, but the sp-congress alliance with Akhilesh and Rahul's youth leadership last year answered
 The state failed to deliver such a magical result
 2016 main pashchim bengal main vam dalon or congress kaa gathbandhan kaagajon par majboot dikhaai detaa tha, par tiemasi ko chunaavon main jabardast jeet hasil karne se nahin roak sakaa
 Pralay Kanungo, professor of political science at JNU, says, "elections don't just mean addition and subtraction
 chunaav ab bhi ek saal dur hai or nattejey us vakt ke jwalanth muddon se tay honge
 We should not forget that the decision of Ram Mandir is likely to come this year

 ''agar koi ek chunaav he jo 2019 tak puure saal kii dasha-disha tay karegaa, to vah karnataka kaa chunaav he
 If the Congress is able to keep this state in its bag, it will revive the party for the next three major elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 lekin bhaajapa kii jeet rahul gandhi kii netritv kshamta par bada sawalia nishaan laga degi
 Political analysts Rahul Verma and Pranab Gupta write in one of their web columns, "there will be many veto players in a coalition of many regional parties with similar electoral prospects

 He studied the results of 1,100 assembly and 213 Lok Sabha by-elections held between 1967 and 2012 and found that the ruling party of the state was more likely to win these seats than the ruling party at the national level
 unhone vidhansabha chunaavon ke do saal ke bheetar hue upachunaavon ke nateezon kaa rajya str ke chunaav nateezon ke saath bhi milan kiya or paaya ki upachunaav kii vijeta party ke aglaa vidhansabha chunaav jeetne kii sambhaavna aadhi se bhi kam hoti he
 Finally, they arrive at the conclusion, "the conclusion of these two types of results is clear — local level issues and speed determine the outcome of the by-election and there is no evidence of a state or national trend from them
 ''vichaardhaara ke saajha aadhaar kaa na hona bhi aise gathbandhanon ke bikharane kii ek or vajah he
 Many political experts argue that today's aspiring young voter may not be ready to sway the governments of the "third Front" suffering from the 1990s discord, and instead Modi's "strong-decider"
 Can choose the leader

 The situation has changed dramatically following the massive blunder of demonetisation and resentment of GST

 They are no longer as reliable as they used to be

 Since the Congress is a national party and has a presence in the entire country, it may be a natural choice to put together parties with different moods, but Mamata Banerjee's ambitions may obstruct Rahul from emerging as an alternative to Modi
 Huh
 haalanki loksabhaa main congress ke 48 saansadon ke mukaable trinmul ke sirf 14 saansad hai phir bhi mamata ne aisi bisaat bicha rakhi he ki pichley chaar varshon se unki hi party sansad or sansad ke baahar, donon hi jagahon par mukhya vipakshi dal ke rup main najar aati he
 Meanwhile, the Congress gave Rahul the leadership command from Sonia Gandhi and the Trinamool has also succeeded in presenting Mamata as the most credible leader to face the BJP outspoken

 Mamta has also started contacting leaders of various parties, including Hardik Patel, who emerged as the voice of the Patidars, and Jignesh Mevani, a Dalit leader who pledged support to the Congress in the Gujarat assembly elections

 According to party insiders, Rahul Gandhi's directive is simple — our goal of 2019 is not to win, but to remove Modi from power

 Therefore, it will make efforts to unite regional parties in those states while contesting elections on its own in Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and Uttarakhand

 It was also agreed in the Congress that the Left parties should be kept separate from any coalition talks for the time being because it can create trouble in Kerala and West Bengal, where the party is in the strongest position

 aakhir kab tak ve pareshanhal hi rahenge? is paristhiti ko badalanaa hoga or yah kaam ye donon dal (bhaajapa or congress) nahin kar sakate

 However, Singhvi describes the imagination of any such alliance in which Congress is not a partner

 Will the BJP be able to stand ahead of the opposition alliance? Even before the opposition parties started discussing the possibility of contesting elections by forming a common alliance against the BJP, Amit Shah understood that the party would not be able to repeat its previous performance in the Hindi belt
 iske alaava endie ke saathiyon ke bich jis kadar dooriyaan bad rahi hai vah bhi bhaajapa kii chintaa badhaati he

 Sources in the BJP believe that the fight against Modi versus others will undoubtedly be difficult
 haalanki shah kehete hai, "ham modi banaam anya kii sthiti kaa swaagat karte hai
 "modi can play an emotional card by promoting this as a united opposition against the entire opposition
" yahi kaaran he ki shah puure aatmavishvaas se yah daawa karte hai ki bhaajapa 2019 main upi ke kul voton kaa 50 pratishat praapt karegi

 is vajah se doctors ne aishwarya ko kidney transplant (kidney Transplant)karaane ke liye kaha he
 However, a relative of Aishwarya is ready to give him kidney but Rs 20 lakh is required for this operation
 aishwarya ke pita ke mutabik unke paas thalandu, paala main jitani bhi jameen thi use bech diya taaki wo apni beti ke transplant ke liye rupee jamaa kar paaen

 aromal kii bahan kii madad ke liye shri gokulam katering college ke chaatro ne neshnal hive ke najadik ek khaane kaa stall shuru kiya he
 32 students of Shri Gokulam Catering College charged Rs 700 each for this and started the stall with the added money
 is khaane ke stall ko chalaane ke liye unhone batch banaae taaki sab apni padhai bhi dhyaan de saken
 All the students here serve mainly dosa, paratha, omelette, beef curry and chicken curry and add whatever they earn to treat Aishwarya
 aromal ke classmet aswin ne kaha, ''hame jaise hi uski sthiti ke bare main pataa chalaa to hamane tay kiya ki ham sab milakar aishwarya ke ilaaj ke liye paise ikattha karenge
 So we started this food stall "thattukada"

 These days, Salman Khan's younger sister Arpita Khanki's wedding is in discussion
 18 november ko hyderabad keflakanuma pelacemen khan parivaar ne is shaadi kaa aayojan kiya he
 The guest list is ready, ranging from PM Narendra Modi to special friends of Khan family
 lekin iske saath hi charchaa is baat kii bhi he ki bhai salmaan apni bahan ko shaadi par kya tohfa dene vaale hai
 According to the news, Salman Khan has booked the Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad for a week for three weeks for the wedding

 23 may ko jab loksabhaa chunaavon ke nattejey aae the tabhi unhone twit kar jataa diya tha ki ve aasmaan main suraakh karne vaale vaali hai kyonki unhone tabiyat se ek pathar oochaal diya he
 His gesture was clear that he has won in Amethi, the stronghold of the Congress till now, and that too against the President of the Congress Party

 Distinction of the Congress The picture of Irani's shoulder in the last visit of the worker in Amethi is being shared widely on social media
 is tasviir par logon ke tarah-tarah ke riection saamne aa rahe hai
 Most of the people say that Congress President Rahul Gandhi missed the point that he was cut off from the ground people, due to which he lost
 2014 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main rahul gandhi se karaari haar milane ke baad bhi amethi se judi raheen
 He made several tours in 5 years

 During this time he filled the water by running hand pumps and helped the people as well as the fire brigade to extinguish the fire

 Locals say that Smriti has acted as a bridge between Delhi and Amethi there
 centre kii har yojana ko sahi myne main lagu karaane se lekar janata tak uskaa laabh pahunchane kaa jimmaa unheen ke kandhon par tha
 Be it the gas cylinders of the Ujjwala scheme or the construction of toilets, Smriti pledged to take government schemes door-to-door, resulting in an electoral victory

 Shiv Sena's dairy development minister in Maharashtra government Arjun Khotkar on Sunday demanded enactment of a law to ensure that local youth get 100 per cent reservation in private sector jobs
 unhone kaha ki vah is mudde ko party adhyaksh uddhav thakare or mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis ke samaksh bhi uthaaenge
 The minister said that Maharashtra, like Andhra Pradesh and other states, also needs a law to ensure 100 percent reservation for local youth in private sector jobs
 unhone kaha ki badhati berogari se sthaneey yuva dikkaton kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 It is believed that there is a well-thought-out strategy behind this statement of Arjun Khotkar
 maharashtra main vidhansabha chunaav najadik aa rahe hai aise main ek baar phir 'marathi maanush' kii bhaawanaaon ko ubhaarne kii koshish shuru ho gai he
 The BJP and Shiv Sena have a coalition but in the assembly elections a tussle between the two parties begins
 pichhali baar bhi shivasena ne alag hokar chunaav ladaa tha lekin bijepi ne apane dam par sarkaar banane main kamyaabi pai thi
 After this, the rhetoric of both the parties continued for the entire four years
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne to sidhe piem modi par nishaanaa sadhana shuru kar diya tha or ek tarah se vah vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaa rahe the
 But before the Lok Sabha elections, there was a compromise with the BJP again
 loksabhaa chunaav main shivasena or bijepi main siton kaa samjhauta to gaya or saath hi vidhansabha chunaav bhi milakar ladane kaa faisla liya gaya
 But one screw has been stuck in this entire agreement
 donon hi partiyaan mukhyamantri kaa pad apane paas rakhana chaahati hai
 But a statement by Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday has brought relief for the BJP
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne kaha, pradhanmantri narendra modi kii upasthiti main, donon dalon kaa gathbandhan ‘‘atal'' he or yah gathbandhan ek baar phir se satta main vaapasi karegaa
 During his address at an event in Mumbai, Thackeray applauded the Prime Minister for abolishing most of the provisions of Article 370 and appealed to build a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya and bring a uniform civil code
 thakare ne kaha, ‘‘pradhanmantri narendra modi ne desh ko netritv or disha pradaan kii he jisamen pragati or vikaas karne kii apaar kshamta he
 i congratulate Modi for ending most of the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution and for the Chandrayaan-2 campaign

 ) In view of the Rakshabandhan festival, while the whole country is boycotting Chinese ashes, the ashes sold in the markets which are being sold as indigenous are in fact similar to sugar
 hamaare desh ke har tyohaar main chini saamaanon ne kabja kiya hua he, phir chaahe holi ho yaa diwaali, rangon se lekar lite kii ladiyaan bhi china se aate hai
 Because they are cheaper, people prefer to take them in this era of inflation
 raakhiyo ke saath bhi aisa hi he
 The ashes with different popular cartoon characters made in China have been very popular among children, although these are also being sold in the markets this time, only they have been worn with a native veneer
 dilli kaa sadar bazaar ho yaa gurugram kaa huda market har jagah sasti chini rakhiyaan desi packing main bhartiya bataa kar bechi ja rahi hai
 Those people who are in favor of Chinese goods are completely killed
 gurugram ke sadar bazaar ke ek dukandaar ke mutabik, "bazaaron main 20 se 50 rupye main milane valikhubasurat stone lagi rakhiyansal main chini saamaan se bani hai, bharat main agar ye raakhi banaai jaae to isaki laagat 150 se upar hi aegi
 Goods are first brought from China to Calcutta from where it is sent to other states
 "aaie ab jaanate hai kyon sasti hoti hai chini rakhiyaan- bharat main lebar cost china ke mukaable kahin zyada he- bharat main rang birange stones, or raakhi main lagane vaale duusare saamaanon kaa production naa ke baraabar hota he- aise main kahin agar production ho bhi rahaa he to uski laagat china se kai guna zyada padati he- khubasurat packing va raakhiyon ko sajaane ke liye duusare decorative item ko china main bahut hi saste laagat par bade paimaane par banaaya jaataa he- bharat main ek raakhi kaa lebar cost or lagane vaale saamaanon ke saath laagat jahaan 150 se 200 padegi vahiin china kii raakhiyon kii laagat keval 15 se 10 rupye aati he
 Those are sold for 20 to 50 rupees
 - bharat main bikne vaali 90%khubasurat dikhne vaali rakhiyaan, jinhen aakarshak packing kar saste daamon main bechaa ja rahaa he, wo puri tarah chini hai
 In such a situation, many questions arise, first, what is not being cheated on the people who are boycotting Chinese goods in the national interest and are the true Indians who cheat? And the biggest question is that given the increasing tension with China on the outskirts, why is our government not completely stopping the goods coming from China? salmaan khan or shahrukh khan kii dosti ho yaa jhagade, ye sab media kii surkhiyaan hoti hai
 Salman and Shah Rukh made fun of the media in 'bigg Boss' on what the media showed or wrote
 itnaa hi nahin, majaak main hi sahi, par shahrukh or salmaan donon ne media ko galat or jimmedaar bhi tehraaya
 Ever since Shah Rukh was about to promote the film 'dilwale' in 'bigg Boss', the videos of the two together were being played on TV channels as promos, sometimes featuring friendship songs and sometimes his film' Karan Arjun 'S dialogues were being shown
 jab sho par shahrukh or salmaan aae to kuch game khele gaye, jisamen media kaa majaak udaana bhi shaamil tha
 Shah Rukh and Salman jokingly said that the media showed and wrote what never happened
 ek drishy main dikhaaya kii kis tarah media ne bataaya ki shahrukh or salmaan ek duusare kaa girebaan pakad kar marpet kar rahe hai, jabaki wo donon ek duusare kii shart saafe kar rahe the kyonki usamen lipistic lage hue the
 So, were there no quarrels between Shah Rukh and Salman or was the media responsible for their quarrel? The matter was not understood because why do they consider the media responsible for their battles, why not themselves? loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ko lekar bihar main mahagathbandhan ke bich seat bantwaare ko lekar lambey samay se chal vivaad ab sulajhaa liya gaya he

 He dismissed Tamim (16 runs) off the second ball in his very first over, which gave an easy catch to wicketkeeper Quinton Dickock with the bat edge
 is tarah pehle wicket ke liye 60 ran kii bhagidaari kaa ant hua
 Then Bangladesh's dependable Shakibul (eight fours and a six in 84 balls) came to the crease and as soon as he came, he hit the top of the world's top ranked one-day all-rounder Kagiso Rabada on point who could not take a single wicket
 dakshin africa ne 12wein over main gendbaaji main badlaav kiya or kris mauris (73 ran dekar do wicket) kii short gend par khatarnaak dikh rahe saumy sarkaar bhi wicketiper ke shandaar kaich se pavilion laut gayi

 Felukwayo ended Mushfiqur's innings in his second spell, who was dismissed for 78 from 80 balls with eight fours

 paanch aktubar ko, bharat or rus ne es-400 air dephence missile ke liye 5
 The $ 4 billion (about Rs 40,000 crore) agreement was signed and it is the biggest deal between the two countries
 19wein salanaa bharat-rus shikhar sammelan ke liye roosi raashtrapati vladimir putin kii bharat yatra ke dauraan is samjhaute par hastakshar hue jo donon deshon ke bich ek vishesh ranneetik saajhedaari kaa pramaan he
 Russia will hand over five missile systems to India in the next two years
 bharat ne 1964 main purv soviet sangh se hathiyaar aayaat karnaa shuru kiya tha or yah missile sauda uske baad se lekar ab tak kaa sabase bada raksha sauda he
 This agreement is also special because India has made it clear that it is willing to continue its relations with Russia and for this it does not even care about US sanctions
 roosi missile nirmaataa, almaz-ante america dwaara jari countering america edwarsries thru sangshnj act (sieetise) kii pratibandhit suchi main shaamil ikaayiyon main se ek he
 The US enacted the act in January this year, in which it talks of imposing various restrictions on retaliatory actions on countries that have compromised with their rival nations
 samjhaute ke agle din, america sarkaar ke ek pravaktaa ne vishesh rup se bharat ke es-400 kharid ke faisle par pratikriya dete hue kaha, china ne bhi rus se isi prakaar kii misile kharidin thim to use america pratibandhon kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 The official said, "the exemption provisions in CAATSA are not exempt for any particular nation and its norms are strict
" unki baton se aise sanket nahin milte ki america ne nai dilli ko rus se hathiyaar kharidne par sieetise kii paabandiyon se chhot di ho
 "the scope of the exemption is very limited, and it is very strict about preventing countries from buying Russian weapons," the official said
 chhot, keval pehle se kharide gaye upkarnon ke liye kal-purje jaisi chijen par di gai he
 "it remains to be seen how America views the sanctions against India
" south block ne is saude ke liye aisi vittiya vyavastha taiyaar kii he jisamen pashchimi banking pranali ko kinare rakhaa jayega

 vipakshi congress es-400 saude par pratikriya dene ko taiyaar baithi thi or usne 8 aktubar ko is saude ke turant baad ek visangati kaa aarope madh diya
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari asked on Twitter, "is India's offset policy canceled? So won't there be another offset now? Did that great slogan of Make in India go sour? If not, then who is the offset partner? ”in the S-400 deal, according to the rules, at least Rs 12,000 crore would have been offset
 raksha mantralay ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha ki mixilon ke liye bharat or rus ke bich antar sarkari samjhaute (ijie) main kisi ofaset kii aavashyaktaa nahin thi, jo asaamaanya lag saktaa he lekin aisa pehali baar nahin hua he
 The Ministry of Defense has enacted an offset policy on the Defense Procurement Procedure (DPP) - which governs the procurement of all arms - under which the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is allowed to deduct at least the total cost of the products being purchased by India
 It has been made compulsory to purchase equivalent amount of 30 per cent from within India
 yah ofaset niti 2,000 karod ru
 Applies to all contracts exceeding Rs and its purpose is to develop arms manufacturing industry in the country instead of purchasing arms
 pareshaani kii baat yah he ki jab baat rus ke saath bade saudon kii aati he to yah apwaad niyam kii tarah har baar lagu ho jaataa he
 The last two major deals with Russia — a $ 660 million purchase of 80 mi-171v medium lift helicopters in 2006 and an $ 865 million agreement to upgrade a fleet of 52 mig-29 aircraft — were also waived
 yahaan tak ki offsets ke doshapurn nishpaadan par 2013 main sieji ne ungali bhi uthaai thi
 There is no talk of offsets in other defense deals that are under negotiation with Russia

 Four of his companions were sitting with him
 baby subrahmanyam, muthuraja, murugan or shivarasana
 a big conspiracy was being formed
 ghanton tanaav ke bich chali baithak
 Every man was putting his side
 behad gopneey is baithak main tanaav itnaa tha ki hawa bhi bam kii aawaaj kii tarah lag rahi thi
 Between the humidity and the heat, Prabhakaran was listening and weaving very fast
 aakhir sajeesh puri ho gai
 Prabhakaran approved the plan of Rajiv Gandhi's death
 plan ko puraa karne kii jimmedaari chaar logon ko saunpi gai
 Preparation for attack on BJP from the platform of Youth Congress in memory of Rajeev Bibi Subrahmanyam - LTTE Ideologue, whereabouts of attackers for the attackers
 muthuraja- prabhakaran kaa khaas, hamalaavaron ke liye sanchaar or paise kii jimmedaari
 Murugan - Explosive expert, Terrorist, Arrangement of funds and money for the attack
 shivarasana- littey kaa jasoos, visphotak visheshgy, rajeev gandhi kii hatya kii puri jimmedaari
 Gandhi family paid tribute to Rajiv Gandhi's birthday, PM Narendra Modi also tweeted Baby Subrahmanyam and Muthuraja arrived in Chennai in early 1991 after taking orders from the world's most dreaded terrorist Prabhakaran to kill Rajiv
 inke jimme tha behad ahm or shuruaati kaam
 Baby and Muthuraj had to prepare people in Chennai who, despite being unaware of the purpose, help the death squads
 khaastaur par rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron ke liye hatya se pehle rukne kaa ghar den or hatya ke baad chhipane kaa thikaana
 Baby Subrahmanyam and Muthuraja reached Shubha News Photo Agency directly in Chennai
 agency kaa maalik shubha subrahmanyam ilam samarthak tha
 Shubha Subrahmanyam had the help of both of them before Baby and Muthuraja arrived
 shubha ko sajeesh ke liye local saport muhaiyaa karana tha
 Arriving here, Baby and Muthuraja started working differently according to their respective targets
 baby subrahmanyam ne sabase pehle shubha news photo agency main kaam karne vaale bhagyanathan ko apane changul main fansaaya
 Nalini, who is serving a sentence in the Rajiv murder case, is the sister of this Bhagyanathan who used to work in a printing press
 bhagyanathan or nalini kii maa nurse thi
 The nurse mother had to vacate the house she got from the hospital at the same time
 mushkil halaat main ghire bhagyanathan or nalini ko aatanki baby ne paise or madad ke jhaanse main liya
 Baby sold a printing press to Bhagyanathan cheaply

 Subramaniam Swamy said - Had Rajiv Gandhi been built, Ram Temple would have been built, while on the other hand, Baby Subrahmanyam was making safe accommodation to stay in Chennai, while Muthuraja was choosing people for his cruel plot in a very vicious manner
 chennai kii shubha news photo agency main kaam karne vaale in shaitanon ke liye vardaan ban gaye the
 It was from here that Muthuraja selected two photographers Ravi Shankaran and Haribabu
 ravishankaran or haribabu dono shubha news photocopy agency main bataur photographer kaam karte the
 Haribabu was fired
 muthuraja ne haribabu ko vigyaneshwar agency main naukari dilaai
 Called a man named Balan from Sri Lanka and made Haribabu's protégé
 isse haribabu ko kaaphi paisa milane laga or uskaa jhukaav muthuraja kii taraf badhane laga
 Muthuraja, under the burden of Ahsan, provoked Haribabu against Rajiv Gandhi so much that the Tamils would suffer further if they came to power in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections
 rajeev kii hatya ke liye sajeesh kii ek ek eent jodi ja rahi thi
 Sitting in Sri Lanka, Murugan meanwhile sent Jai Kumaran and Robert Payas to Chennai

 Later, Porur's house became the headquarters of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination plan
 yaheen se chalakar puri sajeesh shreeperambdur tak pahunchi thi
 Revealed from the Congress leader's book, Rajiv Gandhi did not want Pranab Mukherjee to become Prime Minister
 He was also creating a huge hatred against Rajiv Gandhi in the mind of every person who joined
 unhen pataa tha ki bhayankar nafrat ke bina bheeshan ghinauni sajeesh anjaam tak nahin pahonchegi
 When Baby and Muthuraja added their four people, Murugan's entry into the plot took place
 murugan ne chennai pahunch kar bahut raftaar main sajeesh ko anjaam kii ore laane kii koshishen tej kin
 Jayakumaran and Pius at the behest of Murugan
 nalini-bhagyanathan-baby-muthuraja ke thikaane par pahunch gaye
 anti-rajiv Gandhi sentiments began to fill the minds of the people
 nalini rajeev gandhi ke khilaaf puri tarah taiyaar ho gayi thi
 Satanic Forces, a book printed in the printing press in which Nalini used to work, played an important role in her brainwash
 brinwash ke saath murugan ne hatyaron kii nakli pahchaan taiyaar karne ke liye jayakumaran or paayas kii madad se farji driving license banwaaya
 Murugan, Muthuraja and Baby together find three safe hideouts in Chennai to hide

 Hate of Nalini Padma and Bhagyanathan was ready against Rajiv

 As soon as Shivarasan reached Porur, the trap of the conspiracy of the forests of Jaffna was completed
 shivarasana ne kaman apane haath main le lee
 Baby and Muthuraj were sent back to Sri Lanka
 chennai main nalni,murugan or bhagyanathan ke saath shivarasana ne maanavbam khoja par wo nahin mila
 Sivarasan checked Arivayu Peruli Balan's bomb design, Sivarasan himself was a good explosive expert
 sari taiyaari ko mukammal dekh maanavbam ke itanjam main shivarasana phir samudr ke raste jafana waapas gaya vahaan wo prabhakaran se mila
 He told Prabhakaran that Manavam is not available in India
 isapar prabhakaran ne shivarasana kii chacheri bahanon dhanu or shubha ko uske saath bharat ke liye ravaanaa kar diya
 Sivarasan arrived in Chennai in early April carrying Dhanu and Shubha
 dhanu or shubha ko wo nalini ke ghar le gaya
 Murugan was already present here
 shivarasana ne behad shaatir tareeke se paayas- jayakumaran-bam dijainer arivu ko inase alag rakhaa or khud porur ke thikaane main rahata rahaa
 He instructed everyone from time to time to take correct action
 ab chennai ke teen thikaanon main rajeev gandhi hatyakand kii sajeesh chal rahi thi
 Sivarasan asked bomb expert Aivu to make a bomb that could be tied to the woman's waist without revealing the target

 Eighty grams of Seafour audix were loaded in each grenade
 har grenade main do mili meter ke do hajaar aath sau spellinter hon
 All grenades were added parallel with the help of silver wire
 circuit ko puraa karne ke liye do switch lagaae gaye
 One of these was to prepare the switch bomb and the other to detonate it and a 9 mm battery was installed to charge the entire bomb
 grenade main jamaa kiye gaye sprinter kam se kam visphotak main 5000 meter pratisecond kii raftaar se baahar nikalate yani har sprinter ek goli ban gaya tha
 The bomb was designed in such a way that the target could not survive if the explosion was as low as the RDX and the same happened
 ab shivarasana ke haath main bam bhi tha or bam ko anjaam tak pahunchane vaali maanavbam dhanu bhi
 It was just a matter of Rajiv Gandhi, but before that he wanted to try his conspiracy by hammering
 aaj tak ke paas 1991 main aamchunaavon ke dauraan chennai ke marina bich main hui raily kaa video he
 In this video, Sivarasan can be seen at a distance of just 25-30 feet from his target Rajiv Gandhi

 Here he realized the flaws of Rajiv's public meeting and poor security, but one-day Jack Sivarasan did not stop here

 In this rally held at Arakkonam, Thiruvallur, Dhanu reached VP Singh very close and touched his feet

 The level of security at the rally of former Prime Minister VP Singh was not equal to the safety of Rajiv, but the vicious intent of Sivarasan and Dhanu was successful
 isse shivarasana ke hausale buland ho gaye or use apana plan kaamyaab hota dikhne laga
 Rajiv Gandhi's meeting was scheduled on May 21 in Sriperumbudur
 shivarasana ne palak jhapakate hi tay kar liya ki 21 ko hi sajeesh puri hogi
 On the night of 20, Shivarasan reached the house of Nalini with a newspaper advertising the rally and it was decided that now the plot will be completed only on 21st

 The rally in Nalinisreeperumbudur, the culprit of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination, which came out on parole, was a buzz
 rajeev gandhi ke aane main deree ho rahi thi
 It was repeatedly announced that Rajiv could reach the rally at any time
 pichley chah maheene se pak rahi sajeesh apane anjaam ke behad kareeb thi
 a woman sub-inspector asked her to stay away, but Rajiv Gandhi stopped her and said that everyone should get a chance to come closer
 unhen nahin pataa tha ki wo janata ko nahin maut ko paas bula rahe hai
 Nalini garlanded, bent to touch the feet and the bus plot was completed
 dhamaake ke turant baad shivarasana chennai kii ore bhaaga
 Nalini and Sudha met him in Chennai
 vahaan shivarasana ne sudhaa ko bataaya ki haribabu to maaraa gaya par uskaa camera vahiin padaa he
 Shivarasan entrusted Sundaram with the responsibility of flying Haribabu's camera from the spot
 sundaram ne kaaphi koshish kii par naakaam rahaa or phir us camere ke role main kaid tasveeron ne wo suraag die jinhone rajeev ke hatyaron ko jaanch dal ke shikanje tak pahunchaa diya
 There was a flaw in security, it is true, but the bigger truth is that why LTTE was so desperate to kill Rajiv Gandhi
 iskaa jawaab or sanket aapako bataate hai
 Rajiv Gandhi entered into a peace agreement with Sri Lankan President JR Jayawardene to end the Sri Lankan civil war within three years of becoming Prime Minister
 isamen indian pis keeping force ko littey auki duusare tamil aatankiyon ke hathiyaar dalava kar shanti behaal kerani thi par daanv ulataa pad gaya
 The LTTE thrust a dagger on the back of the deal
 samjhaute kii shaam, srilankai nausainik vijitha rohana ne rajeev gandhi par hamalaa kar diya
 Vijitha gave the butt of the gun to Rajiv
 kaha jhaadu hoti to usase bhi martha
 Rajiv narrowly escaped
 bandook main goli hoti to shaayad usee din rajeev gandhi na bachate
 It was clear that the agreement filled the Sri Lankan Tamils with hatred for Rajiv Gandhi
 isi dauraan 1988 main rajeev gandhi ne maldive main tamil sanghathan PLOTE kii takhtapalat koshishon ko bhartiya sena bhej naakaam karvaa diya
 There was also a lot of resentment among the Tamil terrorists
 nateeja saamne he srilanka se indian pis keeping force kii 1990 main puri vaapasi ke turant baad prabhakaran ne rajeev gandhi ko marava diya
 However, the LTTE has been denying the allegations against them
 1985 main hydrogen bam ke pareekshan kii taiyaari kar chuki thi rajeev gandhi sarkaar, CIA dastavejon main daawakaha jaataa he ki badi se badi suraksha vahaan khatm ho jaati he jahaan koi apni jaan qurbaan karne par amada ho jaataa he
 The same happened in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case
 maanavbam kaa daanv behad bada or gambhir tha
 Despite this, why did he miss it? bhayankar khataron se ghire the rajeev gandhi
 Then why was his life put in front of the terrorists after serving in a saucer
 jaanch dal ke mukhiya kii maane to kendra sarkaar ko ilm hi nahin tha ki rajeev ko kisne maar diya
 Despite this, the conspiracy to assassinate an Indian leader was caught in messages going on between Chennai and Jaffna
 iske alaava ibi or grih mantralay bhi baraabar rajeev kii suraksha ko lekar alert jari kar rahaa tha par rajeev kii jaan ko dilli police ke do sab inspectoron ke bharose chhod diya gaya tha
 Rajiv, who recorded a historic victory in 1984, was put into shock by a bitter defeat in 1989
 rajeev ko lagata tha ki janata se unki duuri satta se unhen dur kar rahi he
 Therefore, he was making public engagement his identity in the 1991 election
 wo jyaad se zyada janata ke bich jate
 Wherever security came, they would rebuke him
 rajeev gandhi ke hatyaron ko reeha nahin kar sakati tamilnadu sarkaar: sckahane vaale to ye bhi kehete hai ki rajeev gandhi ne upi ke kuch police adhikariyon kaa tabadalaa is liye karvaa diya tha ki unki suraksha kadai se rajeev behad naaraaz the
 When Rajiv was asked not to take such risks, his reply would be, 'I cannot disbelieve the public, how long will i worry about security, i have to live my life
 'par shaayad rajeev ye bhul gaye ki janata ke pyaar ko paalane posane ke liye jinda hona pehali or aakhri shart he
 Rajiv remained adamant on his life, defying security and the enemy was also adamant
 shreeperambdur main hui rajeev kii hatya bhartiya raajnneeti kii ek badi vidambnaa ko saamne laati he
 Leaders are expected to go among the public, when they understood that Rajiv Gandhi's love for the public became the reason for his death
 suraksha main chook rajeev kii hatya main sabase badi vajah maani gai or ye chook rajeev ke suraksha tod janata ke bich pahunchane se hui

 It was a disgraceful defeat for the Left parties and the Congress alliance

 The two parties were equally skeptical about the future of this partnership, the voters were equally confused
 jab trinmul kii baari vijay kii tasviir saaf ho gai to mamata ne kaha, ‘‘janata samajhadaar he
 Many lied, conspired but recognized the truth

 He asked the people, "are you getting benefits, why are you silent?" Where they feel that the officials have not done their work properly, then they would also give them a public squabble
 trinmul ke saansad sudeep bandopadhyaay kehete hai, ‘‘vyaktigat sampark, teji se nirnay lenaa, block str ke adhikariyon ke saath sampark main rahanaa, ye sab unke achche prashasan kaa hissaa hai
 "their engagement was also respected by the voters and it had no effect on corruption and allegations

 There was no shadow of the Saradha scam
 mamata ne jeet ke maukey ko bhunaate hue kaha, ‘‘ham eemaandaar raajnneeti karte hai
 Allegations of corruption are a conspiracy by BJP, Congress, Left parties and ABP media
 ’’vaise mamata ke virdohi bhi maanate hai ki unki sarkaar ne logon kii madad kii he
 Congress leader Manas Bhuiyan, the prominent face of the left-congress alliance and bitter critic of Mamta, said, "personal gains

 sarkaar kehete hai, ‘‘gramin garib tabake ke liye kya kiya gaya he, yahi vah sutara he jo bharat main chunaav ke nattejey tay karata he
 The work done for this section proved to be beneficial for Mamta

 In the same sequence, Mamata has invited potential leaders of the Third Front — Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav, Sharad Yadav, Sharad Pawar and Arvind Kejriwal for their swearing - in
 jeet ke kuch hi samay baad unhone kaha, ‘‘nitish kumaar or laluji ke saath hamaare achche sambandh hai

 Despite the end of the visa period, Pakistan has refused to take its citizens living in the US
 jiske baad pakistan ke is rukh par america ne sakht lafjon main use chetavanee de daali he
 The US has even said that it can stop the visa of Pakistanis and it will first start with the authorities
 america kii yah chetavanee pakistan ke liye bada jhatka maani ja rahi he
 Because Pakistan is included in the countries to which the US illegal citizenship law applies
 is kanoon ke mutabik, america se pratyrpit kiye gaye or vija avadhi samaapt hone ke baad bhi rah rahe apane nagarikon ko jo desh waapas nahin lenge unke nagarikon ko america vija nahin diya jayega

 The US State Department said on Friday that there is 'no change' in the functioning of the embassy in Pakistan for now, but the US can withhold visas of Pakistani nationals which can be started by its senior officials

 That is, if Pakistan keeps its stand, then such situations can also arise that its citizens may not get permission to enter the border of America

 CBI Director Alok Kumar Vermaki's plea was heard today (thursday) in the Supreme Court
 court main sarkaar ne saaf kar diya ki sibiai nideshak kii niyukti kaa adhikaar to uske paas hi he
 The government said that the selection committee does select eligible candidates, but the government appoints them
 maamle kii sunaavi agle buudhvaar yani paanch disambar tak taal di gai he
 In the Supreme Court, the government said that after the recommendation for the shortlisted candidates, the role of the selection committee ends and the government starts
 atorni general ke ke venugopal ne sibiai vivaad main apni bhoomika ko tark,nyaay or sanvaidhanik kasautiyon par kasakar yachikakartaon kii uthaai aapattiyon kaa jawaab dete hue kaha ki sivisi kii report par carmik vibhaag ne deshhit main ye karrwai isliye bhi kii kyonki desh ke sabase badi jaanch agency ke sarvocch adhikariyon par gambhir aarope lage the
 The question was also about the credibility and image of the CBI
 guuruuvaar ko hui sunwaayee main sivisi, sarkaar or select cameti ke adhikaron par vistaar se charchaa hui
 During the hearing, Alok Verma's lawyer Fali Nariman argued that CBI director is appointed on the recommendation of the committee
 diarector kaa kaarykaal nunatam do saal hota he
 If the CBI director is to be transferred in exceptional circumstances during this time, the committee's permission has to be obtained
 bahes main dushyant dave ne kaha ki sibiai ke faislon main sivisi yaa phir sarkaar jaise kisi tisare paksh kaa dakhal nahin hona chahie
 After Dave, Kapil Sibal debated on behalf of Mallikarjun Kharge
 sibbal ne kaha ki sivisi or sarkaar act kii andekhi or manamaani kar sibiai nideshak ko chuttee par nahin bhej sakati
 Only the selection committee can order appointment and removal or suspension
 ye maamla cameti ke paas bhejnaa tha
 If we accept such decisions and procedures, then what is the meaning of CBI autonomy? If the government takes over the rights of the committee, then what is happening with the cbi director today, the same can happen with the CVC and ECI tomorrow
 unhone kaha ki transfar main niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya he
 Nariman said that Alok Verma was appointed on 1 February 2017
 niyamanusaar unka kaarykaal puure do saal tak he
 If they were to transfer, the selection committee would
 court main nariman ne sivisi kaa aadesh padhate hue kaha ki sibiai adhikari se sari shaktiyaan lekar unka transfar kar diya gaya, jo niyamon ke khilaaf he
 If the government found anything wrong, it should have gone to the committee first
 unase sampark karnaa chahie tha
 On Nariman's plea, the judge asked what action should be taken if CBI Direct is caught red handed taking a bribe
 is par nariman ne kaha ki unhen fouran cameti main janaa chahie
 On the plea of manish Sinha, Nariman asked that if a case has been filed in the court and has not come up for hearing, can action be taken on the issue? On this, the court said that the petition filed before the hearing can be printed
 us par koi pratibandh nahin he
 It is the decision of the Supreme Court that these can be published
 bhartiya police seva ke varisht adhikari verma ne chuttee par bheje jane ke centre sarkaar ke nirnay ko chunauti di he

 The bench was to consider the reply submitted by Alok Verma to the court in a sealed envelope on November 20, but the cvc's findings against him were allegedly leaked to the media and allegations made by the investigating agency Deputy Inspector General, Manish Kumar Sinha, in a separate plea to the media
 The court adjourned the hearing, expressing strong displeasure when it was published in

 nyaayalay ne 20 november ko spasht kiya tha ki vah kisi bhi pakshakarko nahin sunegi or yah uske dwaara uthaae gaye muddon tak hi simit rahegi
 Alok Verma's confidential response to the findings of the CVC was angered by the alleged leak that the court said that it wanted to keep the agency director's reply confidential to maintain the dignity of the investigating agency
 upmahanireekshak sinha ne 19 november ko apane aavedan main rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dobhaal, kendriya mantri haribhaai pi choudhary, sivisi ke ve choudhary par bhi sibiai ke vishesh nideshak rakesh asthana ke khilaaf jaanch main hastkshep karne ke prayaas karne ke aarope lagaae the

 On 26 October, the Supreme Court had asked the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) to complete the probe in 2 weeks against the allegations against Director Alok Verma under the supervision of the Supreme Court judge

 BJP has made repeal of most of the provisions of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir a major election issue

 He said that Pakistan is using the statements of Congress leaders about Article 370

 Modi replied, "absolutely right
" ' unhone kaha, ‘‘ab congress ko jawaab dena chahie ve aise bayaan kyon de rahe hai jo pakistan ko pasand aate hai
 They should say something that the people of India like
 ''piem ne kaha, ‘‘modi ke bare main acha bura kah sakate hai, lekin kam se kam maa bharti kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 The limit should not be exceeded, which may harm the country

 There is no day when Jagan Mohan Reddy does not visit Andhra Pradesh's West Godavari district and ask for votes
 is 38 varshiya netaa kaa raily karnaa or har daravaaje par vot ke liye janaa jaise aam baat ho gai ho
 Polling is to be held for 18 assembly seats in the region by the end of May and a by-election for Nellore, a Lok Sabha seat
 chunaav ayog ko in ilaakon ke bhavi chunaav kii taarikh abhi tay kerani he lekin jagan mohan ne abhi se in ilaakon main silsilewar tareeke se chunavi daura aarambh kar rakhaa he
 The news is even that the CBI may arrest him in corruption cases
 vahiin, is yuva netaa ne apane par lagaae sabhi aaropon ke liye apni purv party congress ko doshi bataa rahe hai
 The chargesheet also mentions the name of Jagan Mohan's father and veteran Congress leader and then Chief Minister YSR Reddy
 wiesar kii 2009 main ek helicopter durghatana main maut ho gai thi
 The area of west Godavari is the same area where YSR was very dominant and the CBI charge sheet which says that if YSR were alive then he would have been prosecuted in this case
 or yaheen se jagan mohan ko apane chunavi bhaashan main jaan foonkane kaa mauka detaa he
 Jagan Mohan is asking people to vote for these elections not only to teach a lesson to the Congress government of the state but also to their remote control in Delhi
 sibiai kah rahi he ki aaj jagan ke paas 365 karod rupee kii sampatti he jo unke pita ke mukhyamantri ke kaarykaal ke dauraan badi
 The CBI says that YSR misused his position to put pressure on companies and got Jagan invested in companies
 tippaniyan Jagan dropped out of the Congress after his father's accidental death as he was not made CM after his father
 uske baad jagan ne apni ek alag party banaai or puure rajya main odarpu yatra kii taaki logon se sahanubhuti hasil kii ja sake
 This trip was a huge success in the state
 philhal jagan ke khilaaf bhrashtachar kaa maamla zyada chintaninay nahin lag rahaa he
 The Congress could not win a single seat in the assembly elections held in seven seats in the state last month
 abhi congress jahaan ek taraf party main netaaon kii aapasi ladaai se jujh rahi he vahiin duusari taraf rajya ke aisi tamaam mudde jaise telugana kaa mudda, par netaa abhi tak yah tay nahin kar paae hai ki vah kis ore baithen
 The Election Commission has yet to decide the date for future elections in these areas, but Jagan Mohan has just started a series of electoral visits in these areas
 khabar yahaan tak he ki sibiai unhen bhrashtachar ke maamalon main giraftaar bhi kar sakati he
 At the same time, this young leader is blaming his former party Congress for all the allegations leveled against him
 chargeshit main jagan mohan ke pita or congress ke diggaj netaa or tatkaaleen mukhyamantri wiesar reddy kaa bhi naam likhaa gaya he
 YSR died in a helicopter crash in 2009

 And this is where Jagan gives Mohan the opportunity to revive his election speech
 jagan mohan logon se kah rahe hai ki janata in chunaavon main na keval rajya kii congress sarkaar ko sabak sikhaye balki dilli main baithe unke remote control ko bhi sabak sikhaane ke liye vot kare
 The CBI is saying that Jagan today has assets worth Rs 365 crore which grew during his father's tenure as Chief Minister
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki wiesar ne apane pad kaa durupyog karte hue companiyon par dabaav banaaya or jagan kii companiyon main invest karavaaya
 The comments pita kii aakasmik maut ke baad jagan congress se baahar ho gaye kyonki unhen unke pita ke baad siem nahin banaaya gaya
 Jagan then formed a separate party of his own and traveled to Odarpu across the state to gain sympathy from the people
 is yatra ko rajya main apaar safalataa mili
 At present, the corruption case against Jagan does not seem to be much concern
 pichley maheene rajya main saat siton par hue vidhansabha ke chunaav main congress ek bhi seat hasil nahin kar pai
 Right now, on one side, the Congress is struggling with the mutual fight of the leaders in the party, on the other hand, on all the issues of the state such as the issue of Telangana, but the leaders are yet to decide on which side they should sit

 The Delhi High Court has given the Center and the Medical Council of India six months to come up with a BSC course in this period, which allows health workers to use modern medicines in the treatment of common ailments in rural areas facing the absence of doctors
 Could prepare
 iske saath hi adaalat ne chetavanee bhi di he ki yadi aisa karne main centre or emsiai vifal rahete hai to ise adaalat kii avmaananaa mana jayega
 Justice Manmohan has issued the directive because the medical health of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare as well as the Medical Council of India, the apex regulatory body of doctors, did not abide by the affidavit given to the court in 2010 to bring the BSC Community Health Course
 yah course swasthyakarmi taiyaar karne or unhen gramin ilaakon main praathmik swasthya seva dene ke liye prashikshit karne se judaa he
 The court said that if the Center finds any new option suitable in this context, then it should bring a new law with this option
 adaalat ne kaha, 'is adaalat kii raay main, ek baar jab centre sarkaar ne biessi saamudayik swasthya paathyakram laane kaa shapathpatr de diya he to phir ise aage badhkar paathyakram ko ek drudh vaid aadhaar dena chahie or ise centre sarkaar dwaara sanchalit sansthaanon or vishvavidhyalayon main lekar aana chahie
 Along with this, the Center should also help the state governments in implementing this course
 'input: bhashaa The 17-year-old Supriya (name changed) is feeling relieved as soon as her matriculation examination is over

 Supriya's family is equally relieved

 14 of the 1,100 exam centers in the Bihar Board matriculation examination started on 17 March
 26 lakh se zyada chaatr-chaatraon ne hissaa liya
 More than 1,000 candidates were expelled on the first two days of the examination on charges of using unfair practices
 lekin aisa nahin he ki vyapak paimaane par nakal rajya main pehali baar dekhi gai he
 The tenth board exam is a benchmark and the matriculation pass in the rural society of the state is seen respectfully
 aisa hameshaa se rahaa he
 In the 1970s, the then government of Karpoori Thakur abolished the imperative of the English subject
 us vakt elaan kiya gaya tha ki angreji main fail parikshaarthi bhi 'metric paas' maane jaaenge
 This concept was also called 'karpoori Division' in satire

 Shahi has said, copying does not happen only in Bihar
 lekin nakal ko mili saamaajik manyata ise alag karti he
 Students in Bihar have been trying it out through mimicry for years before the concept of 'open book exam' was noticed by Western countries

 This year, candidates from neighboring Jharkhand and Odisha to Rajasthan were found appearing in the Bihar board examination to get a degree

 50,000 for that
 tak vasuulate hai
 Although there is no reliable record of when the teachers stopped interested in stopping cheating in the exam, but according to people who have seen the old era, in the last years of the 60s, there were some other issues with student movement in matriculation and intermediate examinations
 Imitation spread rapidly
 jald hi yah vyapak taur par maanya ho gai
 In 1996, the Patna High Court showed success and the examinations were conducted under the supervision of the District Judge
 tab 5,74,110 parikshaarthiyon main se sirf 12 fisadi hi uteern ho paae the
 In the desire to benefit from schemes such as getting grants based on number of students and category of matriculation pass, bring certificates and jobs based on mass teacher reinstatement and marks based restoration in contract based jobs too
 People are also motivated to copy
 shiksha mantri ke bayaan se jaahir hota he ki sarkaar nakal ko lekar gambhir nahin he
 Shahi, while replying in the budget discussion of his department in the assembly, said, "which test does not use unfair means? Such uses range from matriculation examination to UPSC examination
 ekwas kii pariksha kii sibiai jaanch ho rahi he
 Which state does not copy? Shahi had blamed the parents of the examinees and their well-wishers for cheating, causing them to be criticized
 media main samuhik nakal kii tasviren aa jane ke baad us par lagaam lagane main unhone asamarthta jataai
 Ironically, everything that Shahi said is bitter truth
 kareeb 14 lakh parikshaarthi or unke chaar-paanch rishtedaar yani jis pariksha main 70 lakh log shaamil hon, usamen janasahyog ke bina shat-pratishat shuddhta aasaan nahin he
 While the BJP demanded his resignation over Shahi's inability, the Patna High Court took cognizance of his statement and directed the government to take action to prevent duplication

 In the recently released superstar Rajinikanth's film 'kabali', Radhika Apte and this superstar duo once again reminds us of Bollywood's on-screen couples who have always been discussing Edge Gap
 superstar rajnikant vaise to apane aap main bhi ek khaas shakhsiyat hai lekin unke bare ek khaas or dilachasp baat yah bhi he ki 65 saal kii umr main bhi vah apane se aadhi umr se bhi kam kii abhinetriyon ke saath filmein kar rahe hai
 Recently, his film 'kabali' is making a lot of headlines
 is baar bhi rajnikant kii film kii actress industry kii yang actress hi hai
 The 65-year-old superstar of the film 'kabali' is Rajinikanth and his heroine is 30-year-old Radhika Apte
 radhika apte ne haal hi main rajnikant ke saath kaam karne ke experions ko share karte hue kaha, main skool main rahi hongi jab wo superstar ban chuke the
 If you look at the actress of Rajinikanth's previous films, then she must have been in school when she was a star
 phir chaahe wo rajnikant kii film 'robot' kii actress aishwarya raay bachchan ho yaa 'linga' kii heroin sonakshi sinha
 Not only superstar Rajinikanth, but young actresses of the industry are being signed in Bollywood King Khan Shah Rukh Khan's films as their actresses
 haal hi kii baat karen to shahrukh kii aane vaali film dear jindagi main shahrukh industry kii yang staralia bhattake saath najar aaenge
 However, in this film, Shahrukh is playing the character of Alia's mentor
 in letest filmon main actor or actress ke age gep ke alaava aaie jaane isse pehle or aane vaali filmon main hamaare superstar kin kamasin adaakaaraon ke saath abhinay kar chuke hai or aane vaale hai:shahrukh khan auradipika padukonbollywood ke badshaah shahrukh khan kii film 'om shanti om' se hi deepika padukon ko bollywood main brake mila
 At that time, Deepika was 21 years old and Shah Rukh was twice the age of Deepika i
e
 42 years
 is film ke baad bhi deepika ne shahrukh ke saath film 'chennai express' or 'happy new year' main kaam kiya
 Shahrukh khan-anushka Sharma The same applies to this Bollywood onscreen pair
 kyonki anoushka sharma shahrukh se 23 saal choti hai or shahrukh ke saath do filmon main bataur actress kaam kar chuki hai
 These films include 'rab Ne Bana Di Jodi' and 'jab Tak Hai Jaan'
 salmaan khan-sonakshi sinhasalman sonakshi se 21 saal bade hai or unhone hit film 'dabang' ke jariye sonakshi sinha ko launch kiya
 Salman's stardom was also beneficial for Sonakshi, and in 'dabangg 2', this cleanliness was repeated
 vaise sonakshi ne akshay kumaar or ajay devgan ke saath bhi filmein kii, jo umr main unase kaaphi bade hai magar 'dabang' vaali safalataa phir nahin mili
 Ajay devgan-saishayay will be seen in Ajay Devgan's upcoming film 'shivaay' with Saisha Sehgal, who is studying 12th, alongside Ajay Devgan
 sisha or ajay devgan ke age gap kaa anumaan lagaaya jaae to sisha kii umr us vakt mahaj 6 saal rahi hogi jab ajay devgan apane filmi kariyar kii bulandiyon par the
 Saisha is the daughter of Shaheen and Sumit Sehgal and belongs to Saira Banu's family
 actor or actress ke age gap ko lekar ye fehrist or bhi lambii ho sakati he kyonki aaj chaahe mahila pradhan filmein kitni bhi ban jaaen lekin hero kaa dabadabaa to abhi bhi kaayam he

 ) uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavamein nehru-gandhi parivaar ke garh amethi or raibareli main congress pratyaashiyon ke liye chunavi mulabla kathin dikh rahaa he, tabhi to congress ne apane star prachaarkapriyanka gandhiko prachaar ke liye utaar diya he
 In this way, Congress' star campaigner Priyanka Gandhi's credibility is also at stake, this time on a mission to change the politics of casteist politics from that of her MP, brother Rahul Gandhi, who promised to win 10 seats in Amethi and Rae Bareli
 amethi or raibareli sansadeey kshetron ko aazaadee ke baad se hi nehru-gandhi parivaar kii raajnneetik viraasat kii thati mana jaataa he or in donon kshetron main aane vaali 10 vidhansabha siton ke parinaam rahul ke ‘mishan-2012’ kii safalataa ke lihaaj se naa sirf mahatvapurn hai, balki unke nattejey congress mahasachiv ke siyaasi kad ko bhi tay karenge
 In such a situation, it would not be wrong to say that Priyanka's credibility is also at stake
 congress alaakaman ko amethi or raibareli main aane vaale 10 vidhansabha kshetron main vyaapt visham raajnneetik paristhitiyon kaa bakhubi ehsaas he
 This is the reason why he is asking Priyanka to focus on Amethi and Rae Bareli
 congress kii vyagrata kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki priyanka jaisi star prachaarak ko paanch din tak amethi main hi rahakar bhaavnaatmak apil ke jariye matadaataaon kii nabj tatolane or unhen jhakzorne kaa jimmaa saunpa gaya he
 Priyanka herself, on the first day of her Amethi visit, admitted on Friday that she has been asked to focus on the 10 assembly constituencies of Amethi and Rae Bareli and would probably be restricted to these districts
 amethi ke aam matadaataaon ke jehan main kahin naa kahin yah baat baithi he ki priyanka sirf chunaav ke vakt hi kshetra main aati hai or uske baad vah yahaan kii janata kii sud nahin letin
 In this case, how much trust should be placed on their appeals
 priyanka ko bhi is baat kaa ehsaas he or vah kaaryakartaaon ke saath baithkon tathaa jansabhaon main apni is bhul ko maan chuki hai
 They are also convincing that they will not get a chance to complain now
 sapa or basapa ne amethi tathaa raibareli main congress kii jameen khiskaane ke liye khaas kilabandi kii he
 This is also a matter of concern for the Congress
 amethi ke chunavi maahaul par najar daalen to is baar congress ko kadi chunauti mil rahi he
 In the last assembly elections held in 2007, the Congress won three out of five Amethi, Jagdishpur and Salon seats in the district, but this time the political equations have changed
 pichley chunaav main congress ko mili teen siton main se kam se kam do par congress pratyaashiyon ko pratidwandviyon se tagdi takkar mil rahi he
 Congress candidate from Amethi seat, sitting MLA Amita Singh is facing a tough challenge from sp's Gayatri Prasad Prajapati and bsp's Ashish Shukla
 jagadishpur seat par maujuuda congress vidhayak ramsevak dhobi ke nivedan par party ne unke naati radheshyaam kanaujia ko pratyaashee banaaya he
 Radheshyam is quite new in politics and he is getting tough competition from rivals
 pichhali baar basapa ke khate main gayi gauriganj seat par congress pratyaashee mohammad naeem acchhee sthiti main dikhaai pad rahe hai
 The current BSP MLA from the area, Chandra Prakash Mishra, has been named in a murder case and Naeem can trouble him
 amethi kii tiloi seat par congress kii sthiti thik-thaak he, lekin salon seat ke sameekaran uske liye mushkil khadi kar sakate hai
 In this seat, sitting MLA and Congress candidate Shivbalak Pasi is facing a bitter fight against bsp's Vijay Ambedkar
 raibareli ke chunavi paridrishy par najar daalen to vahaan kii paanch main se chaar siton par congress kaa hi kabja he, lekin is baar use sapa joardaar takkar de rahi he
 Independent Bahubali MLA Akhilesh Singh has been in the Rae Bareli Sadar seat for almost 18 years
 is baar vah pis party ke ummidavaar hai
 Congress has fielded Awadhesh Pratap Singh from this seat, who has a tough challenge to break Akhilesh's tilism and has the support of 'priyanka Magic'
 harchandpur seat se maujuuda congress vidhayak or pratyaashee shiv ganesh ko sapa ke surendra vikram singh se tagdi takkar mil rahi he
 The same situation is in Bachhrawan, where SP candidate Ramlal is presenting a tough challenge for the lone Congress candidate Raja Ram Tyagi
 sareni seat se congress pratyaashee ashok singh or sapa ke devendra pratap singh ke bich jor aajamaaish he
 Apart from this, Congress MLA and candidate Ajay Pal Singh from Unchahar seat may have to bear the loss of alleged neglect of Brahmins, which is likely to benefit SP candidate Manoj Kumar Pandey
 ab dekhnaa yah he ki priyanka kaa jaadu in jilon ke matadaataaon ke sir chadhakar bolta he yaa nahin

 In a detailed interview, the Army Chief is telling Executive Editor Sandeep Unnithan why the transformation in the Army is the need of the hour and how it will give a new look to the Army
 prastut hai baatcheet ke anshampra
 What is the purpose of the reform process that you have started? It has three objectives — strengthening our capabilities, preparing for future wars, becoming more fit and better managing our budget
 bhartiya sena ko bhavishya main jis tarah kaa yuddh laduya pad saktaa he, unki pariklpana aap kaise karte hai?hindustan kii uttari sarahadein asthir hai or kuch had tak pashchim kii sarahadein bhi, jahaan pakistan ke rup main ek aisa dushman hamaare saamne he jiske saath ham talmail nahin bitha paae hai
 So we have to maintain our presence on the borders, we cannot reduce the vigil
 hamen sainya tukdiiyon kii jarurat he, jo hamaari aankh or kaan hai, jo hameshaa ke liye sarhadon par tainaat nahin kii gai hai par agar aise halaat paidaa hote hai to morche par bani rahen
 We are a manpower based army
 doosraa najariya yah he ki jang kii fitrat badal rahi he
 How will the future be fought? Earlier there was a war of small actions which lasted long and the one who stayed was the winner
 ab jang us tareeke se nahin ladi jaaengi
 Enemies will carry out war in discrete ways, wars in which there will be no contact or confrontation — cyber war, psychological warfare and legal warfare
 hamen takanic kaa phayda uthaanaa he—antariksh aadhaarit pranaliyaan or lambii duuri kii nigaraanee pranaliyaan
 If you have to deal with information and fight psychological warfare, then there should be organizations in your military forces that can deal with such issues
 sena ke bheetar kuch sanghathan bekaar ho chuke hai
 This task of getting in the right shape is being done to strengthen the capabilities of the military forces, make them more fit and prepare for the future war
 to jahaan hamen aamane-saamne or dur kii ladaai ke liye taiyaar hona hoga, vahiin hamen takanic ko aatmsaat karnaa hoga
 The strategy and structures have to be re-organized with new cyber warfare and space based elements
 to kya iskaa matlab yah he ki aapako sarkaar se maujuuda bajet aavanton se upar or zyada rakam nahin milane ja rahi he?yojanaayen hai jinhen sarkaar kii manjuuri mili he or jinke liye aashwaasan mila he
 The government will have to pay us for such needs
 kal agar rafel aane ja rahe hai to aapako unka bhugtan karnaa hoga
 We will get a large number of howitzers, we have to provide money for them
 nai chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye sena kab tak taiyaar ho jaaegi?sena mukhyalay ke punargathan sareekhe kuch badlaav fouran shuru ho jaaenge
 We need a new vertical for cyber warfare and space based systems
 samanaantar dhaanchon kii bhi taaki ek agency duusari agency se baat kar sake
 We also have to see how well we connect ourselves with the other two armies
 nausena, sena or vaayu sena is maamle main alag nahin hai
 We are working on similar systems and our ultimate goal is the same
 agar antim lakshya saajha he to ham puch yah rahe hai—ham ek saath kyon nahin jud sakate?to iske saath aap samanvay kii prakriya shuru karne ja rahe hai?haa, isse (punargathan se) samanvay (anya senaaon ke saath) kii prakriya bhi shuru hogi
 This is our way of seeing it
 is tareeke se ham judenge bhi or jointmenship ko bhi puraa karenge
 This is also part of this re-molding process
 kya anya senaayen saath aa rahi hai?haa, ve aa rahi hai
 We are moving forward on proposals to have joint staff within the headquarters
 sanyukt staff rakhane kaa matlab yah he ki sena, nausena or vaayu sena ke mukhyalayon main ek-duusare kaa staff hoga
 This is the way forward
 philhal mukhyalay main sanyukt staff yani integrated dephence staff (ids) he, par kya ham kaman or kor main sanyukt staff nahin rakh sakate? ham isi kii padtaal main lage hai
 It will be within the time frame of next 4-5 months to have staff at the headquarters
 sena bakhtarband gadipoon, topon or paidal sena ko milakar integrated battle group (ibiji) kii avadharana par kaam kar rahi he
 How will this work? IBG is a concept that we will have to test sequentially
 ham sainya tukdiiyon se kah rahe hai ki ve abhyaas yojit karke dekhen ki yah kis tarah kargar hogi
 We have given them a roadmap and they (have to) conduct the exercises and then they will come to us with the corrections as to how it needs to be changed
 hamen die gaye lakshya, bhubhag or karrwai ke maahaul ke maddenjar harek ibiji ko dekhnaa hoga
 When it comes to fighting the war, is cold start still an option? What is cold start? Cold Start itself activates and moves at a very fast speed
 aisa ho chukaa he or agar aap dekhen ki pehle ham kahaan the, to tamaam chijen aage badi hai
 This (the principle of cold start) states that you cannot cold start until the systems are taken to the border
 yah lagaataar chalane vaali cheez he or ab bhi ho rahi he
 Is the government with you in all the reforms you are stressing on? We have full hope
 asal main main punargathan ke bare main itani bebaaki se bolta hum to isiilie ki sabko pataa chale ki sena ke bheetar kuch ho rahaa he
 i am sure that everyone understands that this is for better use of our resources, better management of budget and improving efficiency
 agar iske saath ye teen siddhant jude hai to main nahin sochataa ki iskaa (sarkaar kii taraf se) koi virodh hoga
 Currently, most of your budget goes towards revenue expenditure and capital is only 17 per cent
 kya aapako sarkaar se guarantee mili he ki agar rajasav ke kharch kam kar len, to zyada puunji milegi?ise jaraa thik ulataa karke dekhen
 Today, if i cut down to just 10,000 in the military force, it would mean 10,000 less salary, 10,000 less pension
 
 
 to puunji ke anupaat main rajasav apane aap badal gaya he
 Guarantee is a separate issue
 haa, mujhe puraa yakeen he ki sarkaar hamaari sahaayta karegi
 When we tell them, "we have come halfway, are you ready too?" i am sure they will understand
 apane uttaradhikariyon ke bare main kya kahenge, ve in prastaavon kaa samarthan karte hai?tabhi to maine yah kaam akele nahin kiya
 The current army commanders have been taken with it
 unamem se zyaadaatar mere uttaradhikari ke sahyogi bhi rahane vaale hai
 i have also taken along the fraternity of retired veteran soldiers and discussed this with them
 yah koi aisi cheez nahin he jo dabe-chhipe dhang se kii ja rahi ho
 a lot of things have been done in the army which have reached the lower deposits after the decision is taken at the army headquarters
 ise ham is tarah nahin kar rahe hai
 Today everyone knows that something is happening
 logon ko lagata he ki yah (sudhaar) acha nahin he, to unhen saaf-saaf abhi kah dena chahie
 Is the Mountain Strike Corps still important in light of this restructuring? Yes, it is very valuable
 yah aage bad rahi he
 We are also reshaping the Mountain Strike Corps to make it more agile and more efficient
 mujhe lagata he, pahaado main aapako force ke bheetar zyada chusti-furti, zyada teji se badalane kii kshamta chahie hoti he
 So we are cutting it down to its size, we are reducing a lot of logistics
 1962 main desh khaskar sarahadi ilaakon main itnaa zyada viksit nahin tha
 The vehicles we buy today — Maruti or Tata — have facilities at their sales center right there
 
 
 isliye khud marammat kii suvidhaayen khadi karne ke bajaae ham unki sevaayen sarhad par sidhe le sakate hai
 We are looking to outsource a lot of work
 hamaari kuch imaaraten, ordenance factoriyaan, base workshop vagairah
 
 
 It remains to be seen whether we can incorporate the Civilian model into them
 kitne sainikon kii katautee kii jaaegi, 1,00,000 yaa zyada?aankade aakhir main tab pataa chalenge jab ham pareekshanon kaa silsilaa khatm kar lenge
 The figure you mentioned will depend on how many tests are successful
 to vaanchit aakhri paaydaan vah (1,00,000 se zyada) he, magar ham vahaan pahunchenge yaa nahin, mujhe nahin pataa
 If all our tests are successful, then we are looking at the figure of 1,50,000
 magar nai badhotariyon kii bhi jarurat he
 So where we are saving, some of it will go back to new increases
 to aakhir main aankada iskaa do-tihaai ho saktaa he
 What changes are we looking at? We are thinking of restructuring the officer cadre, want to improve the prospects of promotion
 hamaara pyramid jaisaa dhaancha he or isaki vajah se kisi na kisi tarah yah baat man main uthati he ki afasar peeche chhutate ja rahe hai
 We are also looking at ways to improve service conditions
 ek jawan 18-20 saal kii umr main sena main aata he or 15 saal tak kaam karata he, phir ghar laut jaataa he, pension kamata he
 We are seeing if we can keep it even after 35–37 years
 behatar swasthya dekhbhaal kii badaulat aaj hamaari aabaadi kii jindagi zyada lambii ho rahi he
