 In the year 2018, the Supreme Court gave many historical decisions, but there were some controversies which made it very gritty

 Those who are not aware of crops are making schemes, while criticizing the agricultural policies of the UPA government, Mulayam Singh said that such people are planning farmers in the center who are not even aware of the crops
 mulaayam ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar aane par jo kisaan ayog banegaa usamen aadhe kisaan pratinidhi honge
 He also mentioned about making irrigation free and waiving loans in Uttar Pradesh
 oonchi jati ke liye banaaenge yongdi jatiyon ke matadaataaon se mulaayam singh ne vaada kiya ki inamen bhi garib he, magar unhen koi suvidha nahin mil paati

 On May 29, Amit Shah proposed to give just one seat to the Janata Dal (united) in the Union Cabinet, which was rejected by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar
 uske baad se bihar kii satta ke do saajhedaaron jad (you) or bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke bich sangharsh kii sthiti ban gai he
 As the leader of a party consisting of 16 Lok Sabha and six Rajya Sabha mps, Nitish expected 'proportional representation' in the Union Cabinet, not symbolic
 nitish ne apni bhaavana ko spasht taur par vyakt karne ke do din baad 2 june ko apane mantrimandal kaa vistaar kiya
 In this expansion, which took place two days after the swearing in of the Modi government, Nitish included eight members of his party in the cabinet, while offering only one ministerial post to the BJP
 bihar cabinet vistaar ke do din baad kendriya mantri giriraaj singh ne ek iftaar main shirkat karne ke liye nitish par tanj ksaa
 Giriraj tweeted four pictures of the three programs, Nitish was the only leader who was seen in every picture
 jaahir he, giriraaj kaa nishaanaa koun tha
 The matter did not stop here
 9 june ko jad (you) ne ghoshnaa kii ki vah jharkhand, haryana, dilli or jammu-kashmir ke vidhansabha chunaav akele ladega
 The BJP is in power in Jharkhand and Haryana
 jaahir he, jad (you) bihar ko chhodkar kahin bhi bhaajapa gathbandhan kaa hissaa nahin hoga
 However, this decision of JD (U) will not have any effect at the national level because its presence in these states is just named
 jad (you ) ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''jad (you) or bhaajapa ko pataa he ki hamaare chunaav ladgaye se zyada asar nahin padegaa or na unke (bhaajapa ke) vot katane vaale hai
 The "message" is more symbolic
 ''bhaajapa ne jad (you) ko kendriya mantrimandal main sirf ek sthaan dene kaa faisla karke nitish ko yahi sandesh diya ki unhen sarkaar main koi vishesh bhav nahin milane vaala
 At the same time, by limiting the alliance to Bihar, Nitish gave a message to the BJP that let Bihar run him
 jad (you) ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''nitish kumaar kii bhaavana bhi kam aahat nahin hui he
 Look at the duplicity
 bhaajapa ne bihar ke apane 17 saansadon main paanch ko mantri banaaya, lekin 16 saansadon vaale jad (you) ke liye sirf ek mantri pad kii peshkash kii
 "another important thing is that the JD (U) has announced that it will help the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the elections through its National Vice President Prashant Kishore's business organization Indian Political Action Committee (i-pack)
 There is no objection
 tiemasi pramukh mamata banerjee ke saath 6 june ko kolkata main apni baithak main kishor ne unke liye chunavi ranneeti banane par apni sahmati de di he
 The BJP is aiming to seize Trinamool from West Bengal's power in 2021 and aim to hold its own
 jad (you) kaa maananaa he ki nitish ne loksabhaa chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhaajapa ke liye kaaphi samjhauta kiya or isliye unhone ghoshnaptr tak jari karne se parhez kiya kyonki jammu-kashmir ke vishesh darje se sambandhit dhara 370, samaan naagarik samhita or ram mandir ke mudd par unki party ke vichaar bhaajapa ke vichaaron se itar the
 Another JD (U) leader says, "nitish made extra efforts to follow coalition religion
" pradhanmantri kii bihar main yojit har sabha main shaamil hone, giriraaj singh jaise hinduvadi netaaon ke liye prachaar karne or aisi nau loksabhaa siton main se aath par chunaav ladgaye ko sahamat ho gaye jahaan 2014 main bhaajapa haar gai thi
 If BJP does not know to give due respect to their generosity, then it is bjp's failure
 ''nitish kaa kahana he ki unke paas vikalp hai par ve endie ke saath hi rahenge
 RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has offered him a return home, while Rabri Devi has announced that the doors are open for the JD (U) in the grand alliance of the state
 nitish agar rajd, jo ki ab bhi vidhansabha main sabase badi party he, ke saath phir se ja milte hai to isse unhen satta chalaane main lagaataar mukhar ho rahi bhaajapa ke mukaable unhen zyada chhot to mil sakati he, lekin unki vishsaneeyata kaa sankat bhi paidaa ho saktaa he
 In the 2010 assembly elections, JD (U) was playing the role of elder brother in alliance with BJP
 usne vidhansabha kii kul 243 siton main se bhaajapa ke liye 102 siten chodi thim or khud 141 siton par chunaav ladaa tha
 In 2015, the BJP won 53 of the 157 seats it contested, while as part of its opposition grand alliance, the JD (U) contested 101 and won 71 seats
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa or jad (you) donon ne, 17 siton par chunaav ladaa
 BJP won all its seats
 jad (you) ke netaa is baat se inkaar nahin karte ki 2020 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main bhaajapa baraabar siton kii maang karegi
 After 2005, Bihar has held four assembly and three Lok Sabha elections
 sirf 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko chhodkar jab nitish bhaajapa ke saath nahin the, vijeta vahi rahaa he jisaki ore nitish the
 The NDA government headed by him has a simple majority of 123 in the 243-member Bihar Legislative Assembly
 bhaajapa-jad (you) ke bich tanaav bad rahaa he, par nitish itani jaldi endie kii naiya dubone kaa jokhim nahin uthaa sakate
 "there will be assembly elections next year," says a BJP leader
 aise main lagata nahin ki jad (you) vartmaan vidhansabha main phir se vaikalpik gathbandhan banane kii koshish karegaa
 '' *** NRC main kathith rup se galat naam jode or hataae jane ko lekar BJP dwaara kii gai samiksha kii maang ke bich sarkaar ne haal hi main sanket die the ki vah is par kanoon banane kaa rasta akhriyaar kar sakati he, lekin ab mukhyamantri sarbanand sonoval ne saaf kaha ki rajya ke logon ko NRC mudde par ghabaraane kii katai zarurat nahin he
 He said that the last NRC, which is going to be published on 31 August, has no need to panic
 draft NRC main lagbhag 41 lakh logon ke naam darj nahin hai
 VIDEO: Policeman, who was carrying the jeep by pushing, attacked Tejashwi Yadav by sharing the video, attacked Nitish after speaking at an event in Guwahati on Thursday night
 Is doing so to ensure publication of NRC without making mistakes
 
 
 ham supreme court kaa puraa aadar karte hue samoochee prakriya main sahyog kar rahe hai
 
 
 The Supreme Court itself has been monitoring the work of NRC updation since the year 2013
 
 
 mujhe bharosa he ki rajya ke log antim NRC ke prakaashan ke baad bhi usee tarah sahyog dete rahenge, jis tarah unhone draft NRC ke prakaashan ke baad diya tha
 
 
 Even after the publication of the last NRC, unity, brotherhood and peace among all communities will remain the same
 
 
 "isse pehle isi saptaah sarbanand sonoval kendriya grahamantri amit shah se NRC ke mudde par charchaa karne ke liye dilli aae the, or sanket diya tha ki centre or rajya kii bjp-nit sarkarein antim NRC ke ri-veriphication ke vikalpon par vichaar kar rahi hai, kyonki pehle sarkaar ne daawa kiya tha ki isamen galat naam jode or hataae gaye hai
 Now this statement of the Chief Minister is being considered important, because the Supreme Court had directed the publication of the last NRC by 31 August, rejecting the request for re-verification scheme
 mukhya aarthik salaahkaar ne kaha- companiyon ko 'papa bachaao' kii maansikta badalane kii jarurat, sarkaar ke saamne naa roen ronaayek ahm ghatnakram main grih mantralay ne bhi NRC se hataa die gaye logon ko iske khilaaf apil karne dene kii dedline ko badhaane kaa faisla kiya
 Currently, the deadline is 60 days, which has been extended to 120 days
 assam ke mukhyamantri sarbanand sonoval ne kaha, "agar kisi kaa naam hat gaya he, to ghabaraane kii zarurat nahin he
 
 
 Arrangements exist through an tribunal to listen to their grievances, and the Ministry of Home Affairs has also granted 120 days' time for appeal
 
 
 grih mantralay ne pehle hi un kadamon or prakriyaaon ko spasht kar chuki he, jo antim NRC se naam hataa die jane kii surat main uthaae jane hai

 At any petrol pump near you, indigenous murmurs can be heard synonymous with Freedman's trunk
 pichley chaar saal main petrol-dijal kii sabase oonchi keemat chukaate hue log us bachat kii talash main mubtila hai jo saste tel ke achche dinon ke dauraan sarkaar ko hui thi
 As good as the days of good days are, there will probably be no sway on the recognition of those days that after a decade of almost four years (2014 to 2018) in India, thanks to the long and permanent fall in crude oil prices
 Petrol-diesel prices were low to a tempting level
 isi laalach main sarkaar ne petro parivaar par dabaa kar exasij duty badhaai thi
 How much did the government save or earn? Where did she go? Will the government be able to save us from rising oil prices? Let's figure it out — it was the second half of 2014 when the festival of declining oil prices (july 2008–132 dollars; June 2017–46 dollars per barrel) began in 2017– Lasted until the last quarter of 18
 isi dauraan sarkaar ne petro utpaadon kii keemton ko bazaar ko saunp diya or companiyaan kachche tel or anya laagton ke hisaab se keemton ko roj badalane lageen
 Crude oil became cheaper but not petrol-diesel because by 2017 the government had 21 on petrol
 5 ru
 And 17 on diesel
 3 ru
 An excise duty of a liter was imposed
 -is bade hue tex ke kaaran 2017 main petro exise duty kaa sangrah jidipi ke anupaat main 1
 6 per cent i
e
 (rs
 100 per Rs
 ke jidipi par 1
 6 Rs
 kii petro exise duty) par pahunch gaya jo 2014 main keval 0
 Was 7 percent
 yah pichley dashakon main tel par record tex sangrah tha
 -this earnings were used, as per the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission for allocation of more resources to the states and the payment of the seventh pay commission to two-government employees
 -saste kachche tel vaale achche dinon main do or phaayde hue
 Wholesale (5
 2 se 1
 8%) and retail (9
 4 se 4
 5%) inflation declined
 saath hi saste aayaat ke chalate videshi morche par raahat ai
 The current account deficit, reflecting the difference between foreign income and expenditure, has reduced
 yah thi achche dinon kii kamai or uskaa kharch
 
 
 Now it's time to climb further with expensive oil
 -kachche tel kii vartmaan keemat (74-75 dollar prati bairal) main prati das dollar se mahangaai main 0
 There will be a 50 per cent increase as petro products will be expensive
 -das dollar prati bairal kii prayek teji par curent account dephisit main 0
 60 per cent gain and weakness in the rupee
 -ab agar mahangaai rokani he to sarkaar ko exise duty ghataani hogi yani do ru
 280 billion per liter of excise duty reduction of Rs
 ke rajasav kaa nuksaan or kerosine va alpiji sabsidi main baari ijapha alag se
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Prime Minister Narendra Modi now need the help of the states for the expensive days of election challenge
 -rajyon ko tel kii mahangaai rokane ke liye waite ghataana hoga
 The benefit they got would be returned
 lekin yah asambhav he kyonki centre se bharpoor madad ke baavjood rajyon kii vittiya haalat bigadati gai he
 The expectation to bring petrol-diesel under GST is now over
 keemten bad rahi hai or rajasav main giravat rukne kii ummid nahin he
 In the last four years, the government imposed a heavy tax on cheap oil but did not figure out a sensible way to save this income
 jab duniya saste kachche tel kaa anand le rahi thi tab ham mahangaa eendhan is ummid se kharid rahe the ki sarkaar jo tex laga rahi he usase aage kii mushkilen hal hongi
 But combing the fiscal data shows that the budgetary skills of the finance minister during four years, in fact, depended on cheap crude oil and heavy taxes
 saste tel ke achche din bitate hi sab kuch badalane laga he
 Oil is simmering again
 isamen upabhokta bhi jhulasenge or tel companiyaan bhi
 Governments will do politics of oil prices by watching elections
 2014 ke pehle bhi yahi to ho rahaa tha
 We have returned home to Buddha

 ) While on social media, one thing is being kept on the hanging of Yakub Memon, while the last farewell given to President Kalam in Rameswaram is also being remembered
 lekin in sabake bich twitor par saansad shashi tharur kii patni sunanda pushkar kaa naam bhi trend karne laga he
 Actually, Shashi Tharoor, who was always ahead in giving his opinion, also tweeted on Memon's hanging saying, 'I am saddened that our government hanged a person
 rajya pryojit hatyaein hamen hatyaron ke samakaksh laakar khadaa kar detii hai
 Tharoor's series of comments on the Yakub case prompted some people to take to Twitter to express Sunanda Pushkar's name
 ise bhi padhie : yaqub kii faansee par kisne kya kaha? Taking a dig at Tharoor, it was written in the tweets that it shows the double-minded mentality of the Congress MP, is he even a little sorry for the death of Sunanda Pushkar? At the same time, a tweet has written that Shashi Tharoor believes that the innocent have been punished, is it time to open the Sunanda Pushkar case? yahi nahin tharur kii tippanee par bhaajapa netaa aar pi rudi ne agency se baatcheet main kaha ki vah tharur ke is twit se stabdh hai or agar unhen is baat se itani hi dikkat thi to pehle hastkshep kyon nahin kiya? sirf tharur hi nahin digvijay singh ke twits bhi bhaajapa netaaon ke nishane par hai
 Digvijay Singh has expressed doubt in his tweet, 'will the government show the same commitment in dealing with other cases of terrorism? The credibility of the judiciary and government is at stake
 ' On this, Jaishankar Prasad has raised the question whether this comment of Digvijay Singh should be considered as the official opinion of the Congress? Meanwhile, the president of majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen party Asaduddin Owaisi has questioned whether the accused of Kodnani, Bajrangi and Sikh riots will also be punished? On the other hand, senior advocate Prashant Bhushan has called the hanging of Yakub a failure of justice
 darasal apni raay rakhane main hameshaa aage rahane vaale shashi tharur ne memon kii faansee par bhi twit karte hue kaha 'is baat se dukhi hum ki hamaari sarkaar ne ek insaan ko faansee par lataka diya

 Hopefully! We would have had a factual history of all the environmental changes and poverty in India, but Bundelkhand is the closest to us whose history is available

 Despite the buoyancy of the normal monsoon, the Government of India runs drought prevention programs in 225 districts, which means that on an average every third district in the country has a severe water crisis
 sarkaar hamen jal nirdhantaa suchakank (water pavarty index) kab degi, pataa nahin, lekin keval 1,544 cubic meter prati vyakti pani kii uplabdhta (1951 main 5,300 cubic meter) ke saath ham pani ke maamle main garib ho chuke hai
 There is no shortage of governmental forces (water resources, drinking water, water boards of states) in the name of water

 Will the government dare to take two big decisions? Better cultivated countries are also importing crops that consume more water

 path nirmaan mantri nandakishor yadav ne bihar ke purv upmukhyamantri or purv path nirmaan mantri tejasvi yadav par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki jo nimoch mantri the unhone ek bhi kaam nahi kiya jo kaam ham chod kar gaye the vahi sab ruka hua he
 Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi lashed out at Tejashwi Yadav, saying that those who are about to sit in front of Gandhiji's statue on August 9, should say that i was a nimochia, my father implicated me
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne jis ek lakh 65 hajaar crores rupaye ke package kaa elaan kiya tha uske paise paise kaa istemaal bihar ke vikaas main hoga saath hi unhone aagaah kiya ki bhrashtrachaar se lipt koi nahi bakshe jaayenge
 At the conference, BJP ministers and leaders also lost their tongues
 a BJP minister told the media person who did not speak Bharat Mata ki Jai, he later apologized
 to kala evam samskruti mantri krishna kumaar singh rishi ne susheel modi ko purv upmukhyamantri kah diya to bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh ne kaha ki jabatak desh ke sabhi girjagharon or masjidon se bharat mata kii jai kii aawaaj nahi aati tab tak bharat mahaan nahi ho saktaa
 However, later he corrected his statement saying that i said that the country will be great as long as the temple mosque church and Bharat Mata ki Jai comes out from everywhere

 Mangal Pandey said that the former Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav had made the department unhealthy, now trying to fix it, a new abulance service is starting from August 12

 One of them wakes up in the morning and prays saying Allah see, i am praying to you while all these people are sleeping

 This is what being JNU meant or would say against what is going wrong
 campus ke bheetar bhi or yaman main ho rahi bambaari ke khilaaf bhi
 Today, one has to be JNU and take out a torch march on their campus
 jaise hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau ke 1000 ke chaatr in dinon kar rahe hai
 They have been fighting a decisive battle since 27 August
 un seniyaron ke badale bhi jo sehate rahe or chupchaap uniwarsity se degree lekar chale gaye
 Instead, these students are fighting, so that they and future generations do not have to face it anymore
 isliye ye chaatr naare laga rahe hai, hamen chahie azaadi
 Away from the world of media, these students march in the night by burning the mobile like a torch in their hands and raising posters during the day and raising slogans
 pehle hi bataa den ki enelue raipur main admician itnaa aasaan nahin he
 These students got admission here after being selected in clat's All India Competition
 inkaa kahana he ki ham vakil banakar duusare ke adhikaron ke liye khak ladenge jab apane hi adhikaron ke liye bol na sake
 These youngsters are being raised like torches of mobiles, not from the whatsapp University where fake messages are accepted by people for the whole day, but they are the real universities who demand that the library be closed at 10:30 pm It makes sense librari to 24 ghante khuli rahani chahie
 Do you understand as an audience that their class ends at three in the afternoon
 uske baad kha pikar thodaa aaraam kar 5 baje bhi librari pahunchenge to padhane ke liye kitna kam samay milegaa
 The library here is good, so students should get a chance to use it fully
 inkaa kahana he ki baaki neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii librari 10 baje raat se lekar 3 baje subah tak khuli rahati hai, isliye hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii librari bhi raat bhar khuli rahe
 If the library of National University of Law Nalsar remains open till 4 pm, then according to the library of Raipur 10
 30 baje band ho jaati he
 The library should be open overnight, day and night, those who sell the dream of making you like India abroad, the library is open 24 hours in those universities abroad
 par in chaatro kii ladaai sirf librari ke samay ko lekar nahin he
 There are some issues which, on hearing on the phone, are not sure that the teachers of the law college can dare to do so
 bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko turant ise notice main lenaa chahie
 Because NLU Raipur named after Justice Hidayatullah was also the 11th Chief Justice of India
 isliye zaruri he ki chaatraon kii shikaayat par gambhirtha se jaanch ho or is par nirnaayak faisla ho
 Listen to what the students of Hidayatullah National University of Law are saying
 ek lau uniwarsity main koi chaatra yah kahe ki use bhari class main yah kaha gaya ki tum bahut sundar dikhti ho, aage aakar baitho taaki padhaane vaale kaa man lage or padhane waalon kaa bhi
 It should be said to a law university student that you have done good dance in the college program, now show it by dancing in the room
 yah itnaa syrius maamla he ki isaki jaanch honi hi chahie
 a 180-page copy was rotated among the students of Hidayatullah National University of Law
 unase kaha gaya ki ve apana anubhav is copy main darj karaaen to 177 panna dekhte-dekhte bhar gaya
 Every page has one or the other incident of sexual harassment
 yahi nahin google par ek form taiyaar kiya gaya or purv chaatro se bhi poocha gaya to vahaan bhi 78 pej shikaayatein ho gayi, jinamein sexual hairaasament or comentbazi kii ghatnaon kaa zikr he
 Tomorrow, one of these girl students will become a lawyer, a judge will be formed, what address will be the Chief Justice of India, such students will have this experience of college life
 is par shame aane se zyaada karrwai honi chahie
 The university registrar says that he has not yet received any formal sexual harassment complaint
 shuru ke dinon main dar ke kaaran in shikayaton ko aupchaarik rup nahin diya gaya, yani likhit shikaayatein kam jamaa huin magar andolan kar rahe in chaatr chaatraon kaa kahana he ki kaaphi shikaayatein kii gayi hai magar karrwai nahin hui he
 That is why in this campus, we want the slogan of independence
 bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko 180 pej kii kapi mangava leni chahie or lau uniwarsity ke chaatro kii shikayaton par gambhir ection lenaa chahie
 There is also a cage break movement in this campus
 matlab chatraayen der raat tak librari main padhane or saadhe das baje ke baad hastal se baahar jane kii azaadi maang rahi hai
 Some students said that it is too late for one minute, instead of ten and a half, it becomes ten to 31 minutes, then the direct phone goes home
 vahaan phir tarah tarah kii baaten bataai jane lagati hai
 Clothes are also given details of what wears in the college or not
 yahaan tak ki ek chaatra ke ghar phone gaya ki vah sharaab piti he, drugs leti he, cigarette piti he
 Which did not make any sense
 ek chaatra ne gaiyr haaziri main rup check karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Students at Hidayatullah National University of Law have taken a risk
 sexual hairaasament se lekar saadhe das baje tak librari band ho jane se lekar tamaam tarah kii gadabadiyon par chup rah jane kii parampara ko tod diya he
 They know that if they do not win, if they do not get the support of the people, then they will again stand in front of those who have complaints about sexual harassment
 maamla yahi nahin he
 The Law University cannot remain Vice Chancellor for more than 65 years of age
 vaais chancelar ne kaarysmiti main umr seemaa badhaakar 70 saal kar lee
 The Vice Chancellor lost the case when a teacher from the same university challenged it in the High Court
 unki niyukti radd ho gai kyonki ve 65 saal se zyaada ke ho chuke hai
 Since then, the students have come on the movement because the Vice Chancellor is trying to save his chair
 andolan teji pakadta ja rahaa he
 Students say they need a decision
 ve aashwaasan se peeche nahin hatenge
 Ravi Shankar Sharma has been tentatively appointed as the vice-chancellor
 unhone chaatro ko sambodhit kiya or samasyaayein bhi sunin
 Requested that the students return to the class room early
 antarim kulapati ne chaatraon ko aashwaasan diya he ki shikshakon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 But the students say that all their demands are not being accepted, so they will not end their agitation
 inaki maang yah bhi he hastal kaa warden teacher na ho varna hastal kaa gussa ve class room main nikaalte hai
 Threatens to be seen in class
 9 july ke prime time main hamane bataaya tha ki manipur uniwarsity main 40 dinon se padhai thapp he or vahaan ke chaatro ke samarthan main kareeb 28 vibhaagon ke adhyaksh ne apane pad se istipha de diya he
 5 deans of different academic schools have also recommended
 hamaari us din kii khabar ke baad bhi 45 din or andolan chalaa tha
 That is, the movement lasted for 85 days which started from May 30
 phir khabar ai ki maanav sansaadhan mantralay ne vahaan ke visi api pandey ko chuttee par bhej diya he
 Now AP Pandey has returned from leave and has decided that teachers union closed, employees union closed and student union closed
 bain bain bain, dhain dhain dhain
 
 
 All the dishes from here to there in one go
 shanivaar ko aae notification main pandey ne kaha ki unhone apni duty join kar lee he
 
 
 In the September 1 order, Pandey has stated that the Manipur University Act 2005 does not have any provision for employees' organizations like MUTA and MUSA
 
 
 aadesh main kaha gaya ki ye donon hi sansthaaen uniwarsity main vighatnkaaree gatividhiyon main lipt hai jisase uniwarsity main maujuuda halaat bane
 
 
 The order has banned the activities of these institutions in the university campus and it has been said that disciplinary action will be taken against anyone if they are involved in these activities
 
 
 vaais chancelar pandey ne indian express ko bhi bataaya he ki unhone aisa kiya he kyonki shikshak or karmchaaree sangh chaatro ko virodh or uniwarsity kaa maahaul karaab karne ke liye uksaa rahe the
 
 
 He was pushing the students towards sabotage which was spoiling the future of many students
 
 
 chaatro or shikshakon ne is aadesh kaa virodh karte hue use virtual yani abhaasi bataaya he
 
 
 In an emergency meeting of the MUTA, the resolution was passed that Pandey would not be allowed to enter the university campus until the investigation and subsequent action against him was completed
 
 
 prastaav main kaha gaya he ki pandey kaa virtual order bataata he ki wo kitna aloktantric or taanashaah hai
 
 
 Another resolution passed at a joint meeting of MUSU, MUTA and MUSA states that the government should take appropriate action on Pandey's orders before 4 September
 
 
 unhone kaha ki chuttee ke dauraan die gaye pandey ke adeshon kii aalochana kii jaae or unhen null and void ghoshit kiya jaae taaki wo kisi par badhyakaari naa rahen
 
 
 MUTA spokesperson Professor NN Singh told The Indian Express that if there is no response to our demands by the evening of September 4, we will resume our strike
 
 
 awaz band karne kii factory koi khol le to uskaa dhandha bharat main khub chal padegaa
 Various excuses are being adopted, but if there is no facility to raise voice, how would the story of Hidayatullah National University of Law students reach you
 lakhanu ke hazaratganj kii sadakon par barish main car kii safai karte noujvaan isliye aisa kar rahe hai taaki sarkaar kaa in par dhyaan jaae or unki maang suni jaae
 Their demand is that there are more than 26000 vacancies of sub-inspectors in Uttar Pradesh
 inhone mukhyamantri ko gyaapan diya he ki sab inspector kii 2011 ke baad se bhartee nahin hui he
 Now that 6500 people have passed, all can be kept because they have passed after two and a half years of process
 agar sarkaar 3308 padon par hi bahaali karegi to baaki 3000 se adhik chaatr paas hokar bhi naukari se vanchit ho jaaenge or agali bharti ke liye unke paas umr nahin bachegi
 That is why they are cleaning the car sometimes, they are giving picketing sometimes so that the government will listen to them
 ravivaar ko in logon ne dharna bhi diya magar hua kuch nahin
 Indian Railways had recently increased the number of seats a few days before the commencement of the examination, but after the result, the government will have to take a decision on whether the number of seats can be increased
 2015 main sab inspector kii bahaali nikali jo radd ho gai
 Then in 2016 i 3308 posts
 iskaa riselt aa gaya he magar bharti kii prakriya abhi tak chal hi rahi he
 2016 to 2018 arrived
 do-do baar pariksha hui or paper li hone ke kaaran radd bhi hui
 Students are also asking why the new recruitment examination of the inspector is not coming
 aath maheene pehle khabar chhapi thi ki jaldi aegi magar abhi tak nahin ai he
 In the year of 2017, s Anita, a talented girl from Tamil Nadu committed suicide
 ve doctor bananaa chaahati thim lekin medical pariksha neet paas nahin kar sakin
 After Anita's suicide, there were many protests in Tamil Nadu about Neet
 taminalnadu main rajya str par anita topper main se ek thi
 There was merit at the state level and according to that, medical colleges were available
 neet aane se garib chaatro ke liye mushkil ho gaya kyonki pariksha kaa pattern badal gaya tha
 Anita had brought 1176 out of 1200 in 12th level at Tamil Nadu level
 physics main 100 main 100 number laai thi phir bhi neet ke kaaran doctor nahin ban saki or anita ne aatmahatya kar lee
 The comments anita kii maut ke ek saal baad uski yaad main ek librari banaai gai he
 This library has been built at a cost of 45 lakhs
 anita kii maut ke baad kai raajnneetik dalon or sanghathanon ne uske parivaar ko paise die the, jiskaa istamaal kar uske mata pita ne anita kii yaad main ek librari hi bana di
 It has 2500 books
 anita ke maa-baap mazaduri karte the
 If he wanted to, he could improve his life with the money he got in memory of his daughter, but Teen Shanmugam and mother s Anantham created a library so that the lives of the children of the rest can be improved
 anita kii pratimaa bhi yahaan lagi he or uske potrate bhi lagaae gaye
 Before the arrival of NEET system, children of Tamil Nadu villages also used to become doctors on the basis of numbers, but since the time NEET has come, it has become difficult for students like Anita
 dollar ke mukaable rupaya aaj or gir gaya
 The price of one dollar was 71 rupees 21 paise

 They say that we will fight for the rights of others by becoming lawyers when we cannot speak for our own rights

 The library should be open 24 hours

 yahaan kii librari acchhee he to chaatro ko puraa istemaal karne kaa mauka milanaa hi chahie
 They say that the libraries of the rest of the National University of Law are open from 10 am to 3 am in the morning, so Hidayatullah National University of Law's library should also be open overnight
 neshnal uniwarsity of lau nalsar kii librari to 4 baje tak khuli rahati he to phir raipur kii librari kis hisaab se 10

 librari raat bhar khuli honi chahie, din raat jo aapako videsh kii tarah bharat bana dene kaa sapana bechate hai un videshon kii uniwarsity main librari 24 ghante khuli rahati he
 But the fight of these students is not just about library time
 kuch masale aise hai, jinhen phone par sunakar yakeen nahin hua ki lau kalege kii ladakiyon ke saath shikshak aisa karne kii himmat kar sakate hai
 The Chief Justice of India should take this to notice immediately
 kyonki enelue raipur jinke naam par he justise hidayatullah bhi bharat ke 11wein mukhya nyaayadhish the
 Therefore, it is important to seriously investigate the complaint of the students and take a decisive decision on it
 suniye hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau kii chatraayen kya kah rahi hai
 In a law university, a student should say that she was told in a class that you look very beautiful, come forward and sit so that the mind of the teacher and the students are also seen

 There should be more action than shame on this
 uniwarsity ke register kaa kahana he ki unke paas yon utpeedan kii koi aupchaarik shikaayat abhi tak nahin ai he
 In the early days, these complaints were not formalized due to fear, ie written complaints were less accumulated but these agitating students say that many complaints have been made but no action has been taken

 The Chief Justice of India should get a 180-page copy and take serious action on the complaints of law university students

 Different things start to be told there again

 Even a phone call was made to a student that she drinks alcohol, drugs, smokes cigarettes
 jiskaa koi tuk nahin tha
 a student has also alleged to have checked the form in non-attendance
 hidayatulla neshnal uniwarsity of lau ke chaatro ne jokhim liya he
 From the sexual harrassment to the closing of the library from ten to half past ten, it has broken the tradition of remaining silent on all kinds of disturbances
 unhen pataa he ki agar jeet nahin mili, logon kaa saath nahin mila to phir se unheen ke saamne khadey honge jinase sexual hairaasament kii shikaayatein hai
 This is not the case

 class main dekh lene kii dhamkee dete hai
 In the prime time of July 9, we had told that studies at Manipur University have been stalled for 40 days and in support of the students there, the chairman of about 28 departments has resigned from his post
 alag-alag academik skulon ke 5 dean ne bhi istapha de diya he
 Even after our news of that day, there was another 45 days of agitation
 yani 85 dinon tak andolan chalaa jo 30 may se shuru hua tha
 Then came the news that the HR Ministry has sent its VC AP Pandey on leave
 ab api pandey chuttee se laut aae hai or aate hi faisla kiya he ki yahaan shikshak sangh band, karmchaaree sangh band or chaatr sangh band
 Bain bain bain, dhain dhain dhain

 In the notification on Saturday, Pandey said that he has joined his duty
 
 
 1 sitambar ke aadesh main pandey ne kaha he ki manipur uniwarsity act 2005 main MUTA or MUSA jaisi karmchaariyon kii sansthaaon kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 
 
 It was said in the order that both these institutions are involved in disruptive activities in the university, which will create the current situation in the university
 
 
 aadesh se uniwarsity campus main in sansthaaon kii gatividhiyon par pabandi laga di gai he or kaha gaya he ki agar koi in gatividhiyon main shaamil hoga to uske kilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai kii jaaegi
 
 
 Vice Chancellor Pandey has also told the Indian Express that he has done so because teachers and staff unions were inciting students to protest and worsen the university atmosphere
 
 
 wo chaatro ko todphod kii ore dhakel rahe the jisase kai chaatro kaa bhavishya karaab ho rahaa tha
 
 
 Students and teachers have opposed this order and termed it as virtual
 
 
 MUTA kii ek apaat baithak main prastaav paas kiya gaya ki pandey ko tab tak uniwarsity campus main nahin ghusane diya jayega jab tak unke kilaaf jaanch or uske baad kii karrwai puri nahin ho jaati
 
 
 The proposal states that Pandey's virtual order shows how undemocratic and dictator he is
 
 
 MUSU, MUTA or MUSA kii ek saajha baithak main paas ek anya prastaav main kaha gaya he ki sarkaar 4 sitambar se pehle pandey ke adeshon par uchit karrwai kare
 
 
 He said that Pandey's orders during the holiday should be criticized and declared null and void so that they would not be binding on anyone
 
 
 MUTA ke pravaktaa profesar enen singh ne indian express ko bataaya ki agar 4 sitambar kii shaam tak hamaari maangon par koi jawaab nahin aata to ham apni hadtaal phir shuru kar denge

 magar chaatro kaa kahana he ki unki sabhi maangen nahin maani ja rahi hai isliye ve apane andolan ko khatm nahin karenge
 Their demand is also that the warden of the hostel should not be a teacher, otherwise they bring out the anger of the hostel in the class room

 In the prime time of July 9, we had told that studies at Manipur University have been stalled for 40 days and in support of the students there, the chairman of about 28 departments has resigned from his post
 alag-alag academik skulon ke 5 dean ne bhi istapha de diya he
 Even after our news of that day, there was another 45 days of agitation
 yani 85 dinon tak andolan chalaa jo 30 may se shuru hua tha
 Then came the news that the HR Ministry has sent its VC AP Pandey on leave
 ab api pandey chuttee se laut aae hai or aate hi faisla kiya he ki yahaan shikshak sangh band, karmchaaree sangh band or chaatr sangh band
 Bain bain bain, dhain dhain dhain
 
 
 ek hi baar main sara bartan idhar se udhar
 In the notification on Saturday, Pandey said that he has joined his duty
 
 
 1 sitambar ke aadesh main pandey ne kaha he ki manipur uniwarsity act 2005 main MUTA or MUSA jaisi karmchaariyon kii sansthaaon kaa koi praavdhaan nahin he
 
 
 It was said in the order that both these institutions are involved in disruptive activities in the university, which will create the current situation in the university
 
 
 aadesh se uniwarsity campus main in sansthaaon kii gatividhiyon par pabandi laga di gai he or kaha gaya he ki agar koi in gatividhiyon main shaamil hoga to uske kilaaf anushaasanamak karrwai kii jaaegi
 
 
 Vice Chancellor Pandey has also told the Indian Express that he has done so because teachers and staff unions were inciting students to protest and worsen the university atmosphere
 
 
 wo chaatro ko todphod kii ore dhakel rahe the jisase kai chaatro kaa bhavishya karaab ho rahaa tha
 
 
 Students and teachers have opposed this order and termed it as virtual
 
 
 MUTA kii ek apaat baithak main prastaav paas kiya gaya ki pandey ko tab tak uniwarsity campus main nahin ghusane diya jayega jab tak unke kilaaf jaanch or uske baad kii karrwai puri nahin ho jaati
 
 
 The proposal states that Pandey's virtual order shows how undemocratic and dictator he is
 
 
 MUSU, MUTA or MUSA kii ek saajha baithak main paas ek anya prastaav main kaha gaya he ki sarkaar 4 sitambar se pehle pandey ke adeshon par uchit karrwai kare
 
 
 He said that Pandey's orders during the holiday should be criticized and declared null and void so that they would not be binding on anyone
 
 
 MUTA ke pravaktaa profesar enen singh ne indian express ko bataaya ki agar 4 sitambar kii shaam tak hamaari maangon par koi jawaab nahin aata to ham apni hadtaal phir shuru kar denge

 The youth cleaning the car in the rain on the streets of Hazratganj, Lucknow, are doing this so that the government will pay attention to them and their demands are heard
 inaki maang yah he ki uttar pradesh main sab ispector ke 26000 se adhik hazaron pad khaali hai
 He has submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister that sub-inspector has not been recruited since 2011
 ab jab 6500 log paas hue hai to sabhi ko rakhaa ja saktaa he kyonki dhai saal kii prakriya ke baad ye paas hue hai
 If the government resumes 3308 posts, then more than 3000 students will be deprived of the job even after passing and they will not have age for the next recruitment
 isliye ye kabhi car saaf kar rahe hai to kabhi dharna de rahe hai taaki sarkaar unki sune
 On Sunday, these people also staged a sit-in but nothing happened
 bhartiya rail ne haal hi main pariksha shuru hone se kuch din pehle siton kii sankhya badha di thi lekin riselt hone ke baad kya siton kii sankhya badhaai ja sakati he, is par faisla sarkaar ko hi lenaa hoga
 Sub Inspector reinstatement came out in 2015, which was canceled
 phir 2016 main ai 3308 padon kii
 Its result has come, but the recruitment process is still going on
 2016 se lekar 2018 aa gaya
 The exam was conducted twice or even due to paper leak
 chaatr yah bhi puch rahe hai ki daaroga kii nai bharti pariksha kyon nahin aa rahi he
 Eight months ago, there was a news that it would come soon but it has not come yet

 She wanted to become a doctor but could not pass the medical examination NEET 
 anita kii aatmahatya ke baad tamilnadu main neet ko lekar kaaphi pradarshan bhi hue the
 Anita was one of the toppers at the state level in Tamil Nadu
 vahaan rajya str par merit banataa tha or usee ke hisaab se medical kalege mil jaataa tha
 The arrival of NEET made it difficult for poor students as the exam pattern changed
 tamilnadu str par 12 veen main anita 1200 main se 1176 laai thi
 Had brought 100 out of 100 in physics, yet could not become a doctor due to NEET and Anita committed suicide
 tippaniyan a year after Anita's death, a library is built in her memory
 45 lakh kii laagat se yah librari bani he
 After Anita's death, several political parties and organizations gave money to her family, which her parents used to build a library in memory of Anita
 isamen 2500 kitaaben hai
 Anita's parents used to work as laborers
 chaahate to beti kii yaad main mili paise se apana jivan behatar kar sakate the magar tin shanmugam or maa es anantham unhone ek librari banaai taaki baakiyon ke bacchon kaa jivan behatar ho sake
 Anita's statue is also installed here and her portraits were also installed
 neet kii vyavastha aane se pehle number ke aadhaar par tamilnadu ke gaanvon ke bachche bhi doctor ban jate the magar jab se neet aayaa he anita jaisi chaatraon ke liye mushkil ho gaya he
 The rupee fell today against the dollar

 bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko turant ise notice main lenaa chahie
 Because NLU Raipur named after Justice Hidayatullah was also the 11th Chief Justice of India
 isliye zaruri he ki chaatraon kii shikaayat par gambhirtha se jaanch ho or is par nirnaayak faisla ho
 Listen to what the students of Hidayatullah National University of Law are saying
 ek lau uniwarsity main koi chaatra yah kahe ki use bhari class main yah kaha gaya ki tum bahut sundar dikhti ho, aage aakar baitho taaki padhaane vaale kaa man lage or padhane waalon kaa bhi
 It should be said to a law university student that you have done good dance in the college program, now show it by dancing in the room
 yah itnaa syrius maamla he ki isaki jaanch honi hi chahie
 a 180-page copy was rotated among the students of Hidayatullah National University of Law
 unase kaha gaya ki ve apana anubhav is copy main darj karaaen to 177 panna dekhte-dekhte bhar gaya
 Every page has one or the other incident of sexual harassment
 yahi nahin google par ek form taiyaar kiya gaya or purv chaatro se bhi poocha gaya to vahaan bhi 78 pej shikaayatein ho gayi, jinamein sexual hairaasament or comentbazi kii ghatnaon kaa zikr he
 Tomorrow, one of these girl students will become a lawyer, a judge will be formed, what address will be the Chief Justice of India, such students will have this experience of college life
 is par shame aane se zyaada karrwai honi chahie
 The university registrar says that he has not yet received any formal sexual harassment complaint
 shuru ke dinon main dar ke kaaran in shikayaton ko aupchaarik rup nahin diya gaya, yani likhit shikaayatein kam jamaa huin magar andolan kar rahe in chaatr chaatraon kaa kahana he ki kaaphi shikaayatein kii gayi hai magar karrwai nahin hui he
 That is why in this campus, we want the slogan of independence
 bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko 180 pej kii kapi mangava leni chahie or lau uniwarsity ke chaatro kii shikayaton par gambhir ection lenaa chahie
 There is also a cage break movement in this campus

 Some students said that it is too late for one minute, instead of ten and a half, it becomes ten to 31 minutes, then the direct phone goes home
 vahaan phir tarah tarah kii baaten bataai jane lagati hai
 Clothes are also given details of what wears in the college or not
 yahaan tak ki ek chaatra ke ghar phone gaya ki vah sharaab piti he, drugs leti he, cigarette piti he
 Which did not make any sense
 ek chaatra ne gaiyr haaziri main rup check karne kaa bhi aarope lagaaya he
 Students at Hidayatullah National University of Law have taken a risk
 sexual hairaasament se lekar saadhe das baje tak librari band ho jane se lekar tamaam tarah kii gadabadiyon par chup rah jane kii parampara ko tod diya he
 They know that if they do not win, if they do not get the support of the people, then they will again stand in front of those who have complaints about sexual harassment
 maamla yahi nahin he
 The Law University cannot remain Vice Chancellor for more than 65 years of age
 vaais chancelar ne kaarysmiti main umr seemaa badhaakar 70 saal kar lee
 The Vice Chancellor lost the case when a teacher from the same university challenged it in the High Court
 unki niyukti radd ho gai kyonki ve 65 saal se zyaada ke ho chuke hai
 Since then, the students have come on the movement because the Vice Chancellor is trying to save his chair

 Students say they need a decision

 Ravi Shankar Sharma has been tentatively appointed as the vice-chancellor
 unhone chaatro ko sambodhit kiya or samasyaayein bhi sunin
 Requested that the students return to the class room early
 antarim kulapati ne chaatraon ko aashwaasan diya he ki shikshakon ke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi
 But the students say that all their demands are not being accepted, so they will not end their agitation

 The order has banned the activities of these institutions in the university campus and it has been said that disciplinary action will be taken against anyone if they are involved in these activities

 He was pushing the students towards sabotage which was spoiling the future of many students
 
 
 chaatro or shikshakon ne is aadesh kaa virodh karte hue use virtual yani abhaasi bataaya he
 
 
 In an emergency meeting of the MUTA, the resolution was passed that Pandey would not be allowed to enter the university campus until the investigation and subsequent action against him was completed
 
 
 prastaav main kaha gaya he ki pandey kaa virtual order bataata he ki wo kitna aloktantric or taanashaah hai
 
 
 Another resolution passed at a joint meeting of MUSU, MUTA and MUSA states that the government should take appropriate action on Pandey's orders before 4 September
 
 
 unhone kaha ki chuttee ke dauraan die gaye pandey ke adeshon kii aalochana kii jaae or unhen null and void ghoshit kiya jaae taaki wo kisi par badhyakaari naa rahen
 
 
 MUTA spokesperson Professor NN Singh told The Indian Express that if there is no response to our demands by the evening of September 4, we will resume our strike

 The Vice Chancellor raised the age limit in the Working Committee to 70 years
 usee uniwarsity ke ek shikshak ne jab hai court main chunauti di to vaais chancelar cese haar gaye
 His appointment was canceled because he is over 65 years old
 isi ke baad se chaatr andolan par utar aae kyonki vaais chancelar apni kursii bachaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai

 In the prime time of July 9, we had told that studies at Manipur University have been stalled for 40 days and in support of the students there, the chairman of about 28 departments has resigned from his post
 alag-alag academik skulon ke 5 dean ne bhi istapha de diya he
 Even after our news of that day, there was another 45 days of agitation

 Then came the news that the HR Ministry has sent its VC AP Pandey on leave

 All the dishes from here to there in one go
 shanivaar ko aae notification main pandey ne kaha ki unhone apni duty join kar lee he
 
 
 In the September 1 order, Pandey has stated that the Manipur University Act 2005 does not have any provision for employees' organizations like MUTA and MUSA
 
 
 aadesh main kaha gaya ki ye donon hi sansthaaen uniwarsity main vighatnkaaree gatividhiyon main lipt hai jisase uniwarsity main maujuuda halaat bane
 
 
 The order has banned the activities of these institutions in the university campus and it has been said that disciplinary action will be taken against anyone if they are involved in these activities
 
 
 vaais chancelar pandey ne indian express ko bhi bataaya he ki unhone aisa kiya he kyonki shikshak or karmchaaree sangh chaatro ko virodh or uniwarsity kaa maahaul karaab karne ke liye uksaa rahe the
 
 
 He was pushing the students towards sabotage which was spoiling the future of many students
 
 
 chaatro or shikshakon ne is aadesh kaa virodh karte hue use virtual yani abhaasi bataaya he
 
 
 In an emergency meeting of the MUTA, the resolution was passed that Pandey would not be allowed to enter the university campus until the investigation and subsequent action against him was completed
 
 
 prastaav main kaha gaya he ki pandey kaa virtual order bataata he ki wo kitna aloktantric or taanashaah hai
 
 
 Another resolution passed at a joint meeting of MUSU, MUTA and MUSA states that the government should take appropriate action on Pandey's orders before 4 September
 
 
 unhone kaha ki chuttee ke dauraan die gaye pandey ke adeshon kii aalochana kii jaae or unhen null and void ghoshit kiya jaae taaki wo kisi par badhyakaari naa rahen
 
 
 MUTA spokesperson Professor NN Singh told The Indian Express that if there is no response to our demands by the evening of September 4, we will resume our strike
 
 
 awaz band karne kii factory koi khol le to uskaa dhandha bharat main khub chal padegaa
 Various excuses are being adopted, but if there is no facility to raise voice, how would the story of Hidayatullah National University of Law students reach you
 lakhanu ke hazaratganj kii sadakon par barish main car kii safai karte noujvaan isliye aisa kar rahe hai taaki sarkaar kaa in par dhyaan jaae or unki maang suni jaae
 Their demand is that there are more than 26000 vacancies of sub-inspectors in Uttar Pradesh
 inhone mukhyamantri ko gyaapan diya he ki sab inspector kii 2011 ke baad se bhartee nahin hui he
 Now that 6500 people have passed, all can be kept because they have passed after two and a half years of process
 agar sarkaar 3308 padon par hi bahaali karegi to baaki 3000 se adhik chaatr paas hokar bhi naukari se vanchit ho jaaenge or agali bharti ke liye unke paas umr nahin bachegi
 That is why they are cleaning the car sometimes, they are giving picketing sometimes so that the government will listen to them
 ravivaar ko in logon ne dharna bhi diya magar hua kuch nahin
 Indian Railways had recently increased the number of seats a few days before the commencement of the examination, but after the result, the government will have to take a decision on whether the number of seats can be increased
 2015 main sab inspector kii bahaali nikali jo radd ho gai

 2016 to 2018 arrived

 Students are also asking why the new recruitment examination of the inspector is not coming

 In the year of 2017, s Anita, a talented girl from Tamil Nadu committed suicide

 There was merit at the state level and according to that, medical colleges were available
 neet aane se garib chaatro ke liye mushkil ho gaya kyonki pariksha kaa pattern badal gaya tha

 anita ke maa-baap mazaduri karte the
 If he wanted to, he could improve his life with the money he got in memory of his daughter, but Teen Shanmugam and mother s Anantham created a library so that the lives of the children of the rest can be improved
 anita kii pratimaa bhi yahaan lagi he or uske potrate bhi lagaae gaye
 Before the arrival of NEET system, children of Tamil Nadu villages also used to become doctors on the basis of numbers, but since the time NEET has come, it has become difficult for students like Anita

 Last year, in 2013, the BJP led by Chauhan hoisted the victory mark for the third consecutive time in the assembly elections, while in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in this year, the BJP won 27 out of 29 seats in the state to help the party gain power at the Center

 aisa nahin he ki congress ne shivaraj sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish nahin kii, magar congress ko usamen zyada safalataa nahin mili
 Congress never appeared united in the assembly
 iskaa laabh bhaajapa or shivaraj ko mila
 Not only this, whenever the Congress tried to create an atmosphere against Shivraj, it was duped by his own people

 Gavaskar believes that Kohli should have had an official meeting before being handed the captaincy again
 mid-de main prakashit apane lekh main gavaskar ne likhaa he, 'agar unhone (chayankarta) westeindies daure ke liye captain kaa chayan bina kisi meeting ke kar liya to yah sawaal uthta he ki kya kohli apni badaulat team ke captain hai yaa phir chayan samiti kii khushi ke kaaran hai
 Gavaskar wrote, "according to our information, his (kohli) appointment was only for the World Cup
 iske baad chayankartaaon ko is masale par meeting bulani chahie thi
 It is a different matter that this meeting lasted only five minutes, but it should have happened
 'emesake prasad kii adhyakshata vaali akhil bhartiya chayan samiti ne westeindies daure ke liye kohli ko teenon formet kaa captain niyukt kiya he
 The series will begin with T20 matches in Florida
 iske baad supreme court kii ore se gathit prashaskon kii samiti (sioe) ne saaf kar diya ki vah vishwa cap main team ke pradarshan par rivyuu baithak nahin bulaaegi, lekin vah is vishwa cap main team ke pradarshan ko lekar team manager kii report par vichaar karegi
 Virat Kohli to press conference today, will give answers to these 5 prickly questions? Gavaskar mocked the whole case and wrote that after all why Kohli has been getting the right to choose the team he wants
 gavaskar ne likhaa, 'chayan samiti main baithe log kathputli hai
 After reappointment, Kohli was called to the meeting to express his views on the team
 prakriya ko bypass karne se yah sandesh gaya ki kedaar jadhav, dinesh karthik ko kharaab pradarshan ke kaaran team se baahar kiya gaya, jabaki vishwa cap ke dauraan or usase pehle captain ne inhen khilaadiyon par bharosa jataayaa tha or nateeja hua tha ki team final main bhi nahin pahunch saki
 One section of the BCCI believed that keeping the 2023 World Cup in mind, it would have been a good move to have a different captain for the three formats and this would have benefited the team in times to come

 The bench of Ibrahim Kalifulla said that Gujarat Governor Kamala Beniwal appointed Justice Mehta as Lokayukta after consulting the Chief Justice of the State High Court, the provision of which is in the Constitution
 nyaayamurti chouhan ne faisla sunaate hue kaha, 'rajyapal ko ucch nyaayalay ke mukhya nyaayadhish ke paraamarsh par nirnay lenaa tha, jo is maamle main kiya gaya
 The judge gave this decision while hearing the petition of the Gujarat government
 yachika main lokayukta ke rup main nyaayamurti mehta kii niyukti ko vaazib tehraane ke ucch nyaayalay ke nirnay ko chunauti di gai thi
 Senior Advocate K

 bhartiya badminton star sina nehwal kaa abhi puraa dhyaan agle saal landan main hone vaale olympic khelon par laga he, lekin yadi unhen bhavishya main mauka miltaa he, to vah apane pasandida abhinayta shahrukh khan ke saath filmon main bhi kaam karnaa chaahati hai
 In an interview to a TV channel, the number five player in the world spoke about his problems outside of sports and his dreams about Bollywood
 sina ne kaha ki shahrukh unke pasandida abhinayta hai or vah unke saath kaam karnaa chaahati hai
 She also realizes that by the time she turns to films, King Khan will be aging
 unhone kaha, yadi mujhe aaj se kuch saal baad bollywood main kaam karne kii peshkash milti he, to main usamen bhagya aajamaane kii koshish karuungi
 Saina said, like any teenager, i also loved movies, ice cream and walking outside, but this was not possible due to training
 unhone kaha ki badminton main jab shuruaati dinon main vah videshon main rahati thim, to ghar main phone karnaa bhi unke liye kaaphi mahangaa padataa tha
 But now i am happy that i can take my parents and coaches together
 sina ne kaha ki yadi bharat ko safal khilaadi paidaa karne hai, to bhartiya bacchon ko kadi mehnat kerani hogi
 The Supreme Court has overturned the High Court's decision that the real administrator of Delhi is the Deputy Governor
 desh kii sabase oonchi adaalat ke sabase bade jaj kii adhyakshata main baithi samvidhan peeth ne dilli kii satta kaa resha-resha saaf kar diya he, koi raajnneeti nahin, koi gafalat nahin, koi idhar-udhar kii baat nahin
 Chief Minister of Delhi is not the Chief Minister but LG
 supreme court kii samvidhan peeth ne loktantr kii us bhaavana ko phir se rekhaankit kiya he jisamen chuni hui sarkaar, chune hue pratinidhi or chuni hui vidhansabha ke faisle ko koi bhi aankh nahin dikhaa saktaa
 Means now that era when Kejriwal used to go to meet LG and Baijal saheb used to keep a relaxed breakfast, lunch dinner by closing the gate at the mouth
 adaalat kaa faisla he alji ko mukhyamantri milanaa bhi padegaa or salaah bhi manani padegi, or jaraa adab se, kyonki janata ne shashan ke liye sarkaar ko chunaa he, alji ko nahin
 He is the ultimate accountability of the public
 ab jaraa samajhie ki supreme court ke faisle ke das sabase bade matlab kya hai
 First, only the Chief Minister and the Cabinet have the right to run Delhi
 doosraa-janata ke prati chuni hui sarkaar uttaradaayi he alji nahin
 Thirdly, the government does not always need permission from LG
 chauthaa-ulataa alji ko hi cabinet kii salaah se faisle lene honge unke paas swatantra adhikaar nahin hai
 The LG cannot interfere in the regular work of the fifth-elected government
 chatha-alji chuni hui hui sarkaar ke faisle ko maanane ke liye baadhya hai
 The Seventh Legislative Assembly can make laws and LG cannot stop it
 aathvaan-afasaron kii niyukti or tabadale kaa adhikaar sarkaar ke paas he
 The ninth-lg has no power to decide independently
 dasvaan-mantrimandal kii sanvaidhanik shaktiyaan alji nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 The constitution bench of five judges has clearly stated that due to the absence of a full state of Delhi, the land, police and law can be decided by the central government and the LG but no one is above the elected government on the rest of the issues
 alji ko use maananaa bhi hoga or apane faisle se pehle poochna bhi hoga

 In this connection, Delhi Pradesh Congress President Ajay Maken, who reached Raipur, has accused the central government of misleading the Supreme Court by taking the Rafale deal
 maakan ne kaha he supreme court ne apane aadesh main kahin nahin kaha ki ghotaalaa nahi hua, court ne sirf apni simaaen bataai hai
 Ajay Maken, who attended a press conference with newly elected Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel at the Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress headquarters, made allegations of scam on 7 different points on the Rafale issue
 unhone poocha ki rafel banane kaa kaam hindustan airanotical limited (HAL) se lekar reliance company ko dena bhrashtachar nahin to or kya he? maakan ne kaha ki kisi bhi saude ke evaj main isamen shaamil company se bank guarantee lenaa jaruri he, lekin france ke saath hui nai deal main bank guarantee nahin lee gai
 Maken has reiterated the demand of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate the matter
 gauratlab he ki rafel vimaan saude ko lekar 'agenda ajtak' ke kaarykram main raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha tha ki endie ke qaraar main rafel kii keemat pichhali upie sarkaar se kam he
 Taking a dig at the central government's argument, Congress leader Ajay Maken said that it is being claimed that he (the central government) bought the aircraft cheaply, if so, then why 126 were not purchased for 36 planes
 darasal upie ke samay france ke saath 126 vimaan kharide jane ko lekar baatcheet chal rahi thi
 Out of which 18 aircraft were to come from France and the remaining 108 aircraft were to be jointly made with Rafale making company Dassault and HAL
 aapako bataa den ki rafel vimaan saude kii nyaayalay kii nigaraanee main jaanch sambandhi yachikaaon ko supreme court dwaara khaarij kiya ja chukaa he
 The central government is treating this decision of the Supreme Court as a clean chit and is demanding an apology from party president Rahul Gandhi, accusing the Congress of misleading the country
 vahiin congress kaa aarope he ki centre ne supreme court main galat tathy prastut karte hue yah nirnay liya he or party shuru se kah rahi he ki rafel saude main jin pahaluon kii jaanch honi he uskaa adhikaar sirf JPC ke paas he

 This report will decide how to control the number of visitors to visit the Taj Mahal
 is intjaar ke peeche ek badi chintaa he
 The way crowds gather at the main building of the Taj Mahal has become a threat to him
 eesai ko shaq he ki agar samay rahete intjaam na hue to imaarat main daraar aa jaaengi jinhen paatna mushkil hoga
 What is the danger? The foundation of Taj Mahal is based on wooden circles
 ye lakdi ke ghere kuon jaisi sanrachana par tike hai
 Those who get moisture from Yamuna water
 lekin yamuna kaa jal str kam ho jane kii vajah se lakdi ke gheron ko nami nahin mil rahi he
 This is a major threat to the Taj Mahal
 rojaanaa takreeban 50 hajaar se zyada sailaani tajmahal dekhne aate hai
 Due to their presence, the pressure on the main building of Taj Mahal is increasing this danger further
 mukhya imaarat ke farsh main adhik dabaav se daraaren aane kaa khatra he
 These cracks can also increase

 Niri's scientists conducted a special investigation of the Taj Mahal
 kai maah tak alag-alag tarah ke survey kiye
 To reduce the danger hovering at the Taj Mahal, Nirhi completed the investigation of all the aspects on the basis of facts
 paryatakon kii sankhya par niyantrantajmahal aane vaale paryatakon kii sankhya ko niyantrit karke is khatre ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The ASI had also prepared proposals for this
 eesai kaa maananaa he ki paryatakon ko 3 hajaar prati ghanta kii ausat se tajmahal main bheja jaae
 In this way, 24 thousand tourists will be able to see the Taj Mahal in eight hours

 Existing tickets are for the whole day
 usamen vakt kii koi pabandi nahin he
 Similarly, the closure of the entry of tourists on the main building (which is completely made of white marble), the second ticket separately to go to the main monument in Taj Mahal and the tourist to be removed from one side only (forest Proposals like -ve) have also been sent to the Supreme Court
 kyon chintit he eesai?tajmahal ko bane 362 saal ho chuke hai
 Its care is the responsibility of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)
 tajmahal par badhate dabaav ko lekar adhikari pareshaan hai
 Nearly two years have passed
 lekin niri ne apni report abhi tak supreme court ko nahin saunpi he
 Munjar Ali, assistant engineer, patron of the Taj Mahal, says that Niri's detailed report has not arrived
 isliye abhi is maamle main kuch bhi kahana jaldbaaji hogi
 But we are worried about the increasing pressure on the Taj Mahal
 mukhya imaarat par dabaav kam karnaa jaruri he
 But Niri has to take the final decision
 usee ke aadhaar par ham kaam karenge
 Significantly, 50 to 70 lakh tourists visit Agra every year to see the Taj Mahal
 jinamein takreeban 12 fisadi videshi sailaani bhi shaamil hote hai
 This number is increasing every year

 It was priced at $ 35, which was very low, so it immediately caught the world's attention

 The head and co-commissioner of the Mumbai Traffic Police, Milind Bharambe, said that the representative of the authorized agency will take money there too
 kisi bhi halaat main koi bhi trephic police vaala nakad nahin jamaa karegaa
 It started from this year

 The central government has given great relief to the heart patients
 centre sarkaar ne dawa lage hue stant (DES) kii keemton main 8 fisadi kii katautee kar di he
 This has been announced by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), the central body that monitors drug prices
 yah chhot is ghoshnaa ke saath hi lagu ho chuki he or agle saal 31 march tak lagu rahegi
 Know how much you will have to pay for the DES stent NPPA said that till now you had to pay 30180 rupees for the medicine stent
 haalanki is katautee ke baad inaki keemat 27890 rupye ho gai he
 a stent made of base metal is expensive, while the government has given relief in the case of DES
 vahiin, usne base metal se bane stant kii keemton main halki badhotaree kii he
 After this announcement, the price of a stent made of base metal has come to Rs 7660
 pehle iske liye aapako 7400 rupee chukaane padate the
 The good thing is that the rising prices of stents made of base metal will not have much effect on the patients
 kyonki desh main 95 fisadi se bhi zyada dil ke marij deies kaa hi istemaal karte hai
 Relief was also received last year
 Last year also the government gave the biggest relief to the patients of the heart
 tab sarkaar ne stant kii keemton main kareeb 85 fisadi kii katautee kii thi
 This announcement was also made by the government in the month of February itself
 iske saath hi sarkaar ne base metal se bane stant kii keemat bhi ghatai thi or ise 7400 rupee kar diya tha
 At the same time the price of the drug-stent was reduced to Rs 30180
 kareeb ek saal baad phir sarkaar ne dil ke marijon ko raahat dete hue dawa lage stant kii keemton main raahat kaa elaan kiya he
 These steps have been taken by the NPPA also gave strict instructions to private hospitals regarding the use of stents
 usne kaha he ki jab bhi aspataal kaa bill taiyaar karen, to isamen duusare utpaadon kii keemat aspataal ke bill se alag bataai jaae
 Along with this, he has also asked for suggestions by 15 March
 isliye uthaaya ye kadamdarasal pichley saal jab NPPA ne stant kii keemton main katautee kii thi, tab kai nijee aspataalon ne dil kii beemaari main istemaal hone vaale duusare utpaadon kii keemten badha di thim
 Due to this, the relief given to the heart patients proved to be insufficient
 isi ko dekhte hue NPPA ne yah kadam uthaaya he

 saath hi mul dhara main silence period yani chunaav prachaar band hone ke baad jansabha karne, cinema yaa theatre main chunavi saamagree dikhaane par pabandi lag jaati he
 Silence period begins exactly 48 hours before the start of voting
 ayog kii sifaarish ke mutabik arapy act kii dhara 126 (2) or iti act main dhara 2 (w) ke samavesh se samasya hal ho jaaegi
 By adding provisions (2) in RP Act 126, broadcasting of electoral content on social media platforms through print media, news portals, digital versions of print media and mobiles can be stopped
 saath hi abhi niyam na hone se adaalaton ko bhi dakhal dene kaa adhikaar he
 Therefore, the Government should amend the Act and make a clear legislative provision that the courts should not interfere on it until the Commission or the Chief Electoral Officer of the states file a complaint
 ayog kii is chitthee se pehle vidhi ayog apni 255veen report main bhi is badlaav or sanshodhan kii sifarish kar chukaa he
