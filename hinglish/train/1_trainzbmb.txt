 khaas baat ye he ki isi sivisi ne beete teen saal main teen baar banking main satarkta baratane ke liye punjab neshnal bank ko aword diye hai
 Two of these awards were given to Punjab National Bank last year, the year in which PNB issued 293 lous to Nirav Modi and his family

 He took loans from Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India

 After this, banks started the auction of various properties of Kothari and his family members last year to recover some of their dues
 kanpur ke maal road ke city centre main rotomac company ke ofis par kai dinon se taala band he
 Following the complaint of the Bank of Baroda, the CBI has filed an FIR against him and raided his three locations in Kanpur
 vikram kothaari, unki patni or bete se sibiai ke afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Earlier it was said that Vikram Kothari has also fled abroad but he was seen at a wedding ceremony in Kanpur on Sunday night
 gaban ko lekar sawaalon ke jawaab main kothaari ne kaha ki 'main desh chhodkar bhaag nahin rahaa hum
 i am from Kanpur and will live here

 Actually everyone knows that it is nothing to be

 On the question of not repaying the loan, Kothari said that 'I have taken a loan from the bank, but it is wrong to not repay the loan
 meraa or bank kaa neshnal company lau tribunel ke andar cese chal rahaa he
 On the other hand, Kothari's lawyer says that if a bank does not repay the loan, it should not be called fraud, it is not a crime

 The Nirav Modi episode after the Pakoda episode has awakened people's imagination
 wo modi ko lekar tarah-tarah kaa jogira sara raara likh rahe hai
 One has written that the debt is so strange, if the rich grow, they leave the country, and if the poor grow, they leave the body
 is bich khabar ai he ki ghotaale ke ujagar hone ke baad gitanjali james limited kii complayens adhikari pankhudi warrange ne antaratma kii awaz par or chif financial afasar chandrakant karkare ne biimaar patni ke naam par istipha de diya he
 a similar creation scandal came to light in Bihar in August last year
 srijan ghotaalaa bhi banking ghotaalaa tha
 In 2013 itself, the Reserve Bank of India wrote that the creation account should be investigated but not investigated, the scam continued
 ab jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to maamla sibiai ke paas gaya
 The CBI has been investigating for 6 months but the main accused in the creation scam have not even been arrested
 tippaniyan Our colleague Manish Kumar has filed a report that so far the main accused in the creation scam are Priya and Amit absconding
 sibiai ne abhi tak giraftaar ke liye warrant tak nahin liya he
 This is the speed of CBI regarding this 1500 crore scam
 sarkaar kii yojanaayen jab bhagalpur pahunchati thim to ziladhikari check kaat kar bhagalpur ke bank of baroda kii shakha ko dete the ki paisa srijan naam kii sanstha ke khate main jamaa kara diya jaae
 Money used to flow from there and was distributed among the people
 yah aisa ghotaalaa he agar isaki tezi se jaanch hoti to duusare rajyon par bhi asar padataa magar sab kuch dhimi gati ke samachar kii tarah bad rahaa he
 The government has changed in Bihar and the creation scandal has slowed down
 6 maheene main sibiai mukhya abhiyukt ko giraftaar na kar sake to kya kaha jaae jabaki sibiai abhi tak 5 chargeshit, 2 supplementry chargeshit daayar kar chuki he
 Right now the investigation is taking place
 do teen dinon baad jab media kaa focus badalegaa to punjab neshnal bank ke ghotaale kaa haal bhi srijan ghotaale ke jaisaa ho jayega
 In a poor state like Bihar, if someone takes 1500 crores of loot, and no matter what, then God is the owner of the poor
 press conference main jo sawaal uthaae ja rahe hai wo shor paidaa karne ke liye zyaada lagate hai, jawaab dene ke liye kam
 It was reported in the news that assets worth more than 5000 crores were recovered
 to in maamalon ke jaankaron ne kaha ki neerav modi kaa khel hi 10 rupee ke maal ko 500 rupye kaa bataa kar bechney kaa he
 Have our investigative agencies caught the goods worth 5000 crores, or is it not that the entire consignment is worth 100 crores
 neerav modi abhi tak jaanch agenciyon kii giraft main nahin aayaa he
 Our Mehul Bhai of the Prime Minister has also not been caught so far, whose company is accused of defrauding 4,886 crore
 dukaanon main chaape pad rahe hai
 The shopkeeper is not known
 punjab neshnal bank ne apni taraf se nahin kaha he ki use 5000 karod mil gaye hai
 The headline of newspapers is managed
 bina kisi aadhaar ke khabar chap gai ki 5000 karod baraamad kar liye gaye
 This information also remains in its place that an extreme point of this scam also reaches in 2017 when Gitanjali Gems Limited receives Letter of Undertaking ie LOU for withdrawal of around 5000 crores
 15 farvari ko sibiai kii ore se darj duusari exiaar main kaha gaya he ki mehul chaukasee ne 143 aloyu ke zarie 4,887 karod rupye kaa chuunaa lagaaya he
 Mehul Choksi is the head of Gitanjali Gems Limited
 mehul chaukasee kahaan he, usase poochtacha kahaan ho rahi he, use bachaane main koun laga he
 Bank employees are repeatedly messaging that such a big scam was not possible with such a small level of employees
 ham log das karod kaa lone tak nahin de sakate hai
 Thousands of crores of loans cannot be done without the involvement of high level officials
 sari jaankaree sutron ke hawaale se aa rahi he, koi is par mukammal jaankaree nahin de rahaa he, bas neerav modi kiskaa kiraayedaar tha, kisne usase hira karidaa, in sab baton se janata ko bahalaaya ja rahaa he
 The Defense Minister had to come to tell that Abhishek Manu Singhvi's wife had bought a diamond worth Rs 1
5 crore
 kya ab ve yah bhi bataane vaali hai ki itane saalon main kis kis ne hira karidaa
 Are they convinced that the big leaders of their party did not buy diamonds from there or that the children of the leaders did not work there
 beti or bivi ke bahaane raksha mantri kya sabit karnaa chaahati hai
 By the way, now that it is known that a fraud named Nirav Modi has sold a diamond of 10 rupees for 200, then it should be expected that all the buyers will come out crying themselves
 jinke yahaan shaadiyon main in logon ne heere kaa set tohfe main diya hoga ab ve bhi ro rahe honge
 By the way, if Nirmala Sitharaman had come to the press conference, she should have told why the Registrar of Companies had canceled the whistle blower complaint in August 2016
 jabaki wo shikaayat piemo ne forverd kii thi
 Let me tell you two things
 
 
 kya jab koi shikaayat karata he to uski jaanch or nirast karne kaa faisalaa koi clerk letaa he yaa koi adhikari letaa he, kis aadhaar par faisalaa hota he, ve khud bhi karporate maamalon ke mantri rahi hai
 Not only this, Santosh Srivastava resigned from Geetanjali Limited in 2013 and made complaints when Mehul Choksi called and threatened him
 unki selary kaa bakaayaa aaj tak nahin diya
 a fake case was done in which Santosh was acquitted
 aarthik aparaadh shakha ne apni jaanch main ek bhi aarope sahi nahin paaya
 Meanwhile, besides Nirav Modi's house in Mumbai, three Surat and one Delhi locations have been raided by the Enforcement Directorate
 udhar sibiai ne neerav modi kii company ke duusare cheef financial ofisar ravi gupta ko bhi poochtacha ke liye saman kiya
 The CBI is questioning Vipul Ambani, another CFO of the company, since Sunday
 bank ke kuch nilambit adhikariyon se bhi sibiai ne poochtacha kii he
 Mumbai's Brady House branch, which was at the center of the Punjab National Bank scam, was first sealed but later CBI officials opened the seal and went inside the branch for investigation
 kai bank adhikariyon ko bhi vahaan jaanch or poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 From this branch, the scam of 11,400 crores was laid
 is ghotaale kaa ek mukhya aaropee gokulanath shetty isi branch kaa dipti manager tha jo ab sibiai kii hiraasat main he
 It is alleged that the letter of understanding was issued with the help of Gokulnath Shetty, with the help of which Punjab National Bank guaranteed other banks abroad for Nirav Modi
 is ghotaale ko kaise anjaam diya gaya or isamen kul kitne logon kii sathganth thi ise lekar abhi alag alag staron par kayaas hi chal rahe hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay in Live Mint has tried to explain this scam in his report
 pehle SWIFT ko samajhie yani Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
 a system whereby banks around the world securely exchange information and instructions related to financial transactions through a code system among themselves
 tamal bandyopadhyaay apane lekh main kehete hai ki ki SWIFT ke zarie kisi bank ko dharashayi karne ke liye kam se kam teen adhikariyon kii zarurat hoti he

 But three are not enough
 kyonki vittiya lenden ke liye SWIFT massej jab videsh main kisi bank ko bheja jaataa he to wo bank lone ko conform karne ke liye is massej ko waapas pehle bank main bhejtaa he
 In the first bank, this message goes to the person, then it is different from the maker, checker and the verifier
 ye massej ek secyord room main aata he or ek alag printer par print hota he
 Very few people are allowed to visit this room
 to sawaal ye uthta he ki kya brady house branch main gokulanath shetty ne ye chaaron bhoomikaayen nibhaain? kya aisa ho saktaa he? jaankaron kaa kahana he ki ye sambhav nahin he

 Two of these awards were given to Punjab National Bank last year, the year in which PNB issued 293 lous to Nirav Modi and his family
 is sivisi se hi poocha janaa chahie ki wo satarkta puraskaar kaise detaa he
 What is its process of awarding
 is ghatana se satarkta ayog kii chhavi ko kitna dhakka pahunchaa he, basharte is dhakke se kisi ko fark padataa ho
 Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary presented the awards with his own hands
 ab vahi unase puch rahe hai ki gadabadi kyon or kaise ho gai
 They should themselves come out in front of the public and tell their views
 kaarobaari vikram kothaari kii company rotomac kii banaai kalam kareed kar ham log sach likhte hai magar company vaale vikram kothaari 3695 karod nahin chukaa paa rahe hai
 He took loans from Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India
 in bainkon ne niyamon ko taak par rakhkar vikram kothaari ko lone diya
 But now Kothari is neither paying interest nor origin
 farvari 2017 main lone chukaane main naakaam rahane par bainkon ne unhen vilphul difolter ghoshit kiya yani jo jaanboojhkar lone chukaane main asamarthta jataae
 After this, banks started the auction of various properties of Kothari and his family members last year to recover some of their dues
 kanpur ke maal road ke city centre main rotomac company ke ofis par kai dinon se taala band he
 Following the complaint of the Bank of Baroda, the CBI has filed an FIR against him and raided his three locations in Kanpur
 vikram kothaari, unki patni or bete se sibiai ke afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Earlier it was said that Vikram Kothari has also fled abroad but he was seen at a wedding ceremony in Kanpur on Sunday night
 gaban ko lekar sawaalon ke jawaab main kothaari ne kaha ki 'main desh chhodkar bhaag nahin rahaa hum
 i am from Kanpur and will live here
 bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 i was aghast after hearing from his mouth
 lone lekar gaban karne main bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he yaa vaaki bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 Actually everyone knows that it is nothing to be
 aise hi jaanch vaanch hoti rahegi baad main sab rafa dfa
 On the question of not repaying the loan, Kothari said that 'I have taken a loan from the bank, but it is wrong to not repay the loan
 meraa or bank kaa neshnal company lau tribunel ke andar cese chal rahaa he
 On the other hand, Kothari's lawyer says that if a bank does not repay the loan, it should not be called fraud, it is not a crime
 ek janaa pahachaanaa paan masala brands paan paraag vikram kothaari parivaar kaa hi he
 The Nirav Modi episode after the Pakoda episode has awakened people's imagination
 wo modi ko lekar tarah-tarah kaa jogira sara raara likh rahe hai
 One has written that the debt is so strange, if the rich grow, they leave the country, and if the poor grow, they leave the body
 is bich khabar ai he ki ghotaale ke ujagar hone ke baad gitanjali james limited kii complayens adhikari pankhudi warrange ne antaratma kii awaz par or chif financial afasar chandrakant karkare ne biimaar patni ke naam par istipha de diya he
 a similar creation scandal came to light in Bihar in August last year
 srijan ghotaalaa bhi banking ghotaalaa tha
 In 2013 itself, the Reserve Bank of India wrote that the creation account should be investigated but not investigated, the scam continued
 ab jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to maamla sibiai ke paas gaya
 The CBI has been investigating for 6 months but the main accused in the creation scam have not even been arrested
 tippaniyan Our colleague Manish Kumar has filed a report that so far the main accused in the creation scam are Priya and Amit absconding
 sibiai ne abhi tak giraftaar ke liye warrant tak nahin liya he
 This is the speed of CBI regarding this 1500 crore scam
 sarkaar kii yojanaayen jab bhagalpur pahunchati thim to ziladhikari check kaat kar bhagalpur ke bank of baroda kii shakha ko dete the ki paisa srijan naam kii sanstha ke khate main jamaa kara diya jaae
 Money used to flow from there and was distributed among the people
 yah aisa ghotaalaa he agar isaki tezi se jaanch hoti to duusare rajyon par bhi asar padataa magar sab kuch dhimi gati ke samachar kii tarah bad rahaa he
 The government has changed in Bihar and the creation scandal has slowed down
 6 maheene main sibiai mukhya abhiyukt ko giraftaar na kar sake to kya kaha jaae jabaki sibiai abhi tak 5 chargeshit, 2 supplementry chargeshit daayar kar chuki he
 Right now the investigation is taking place
 do teen dinon baad jab media kaa focus badalegaa to punjab neshnal bank ke ghotaale kaa haal bhi srijan ghotaale ke jaisaa ho jayega
 In a poor state like Bihar, if someone takes 1500 crores of loot, and no matter what, then God is the owner of the poor
 bank jagat ke karmchaaree baar baar yah massej kar rahe hai ki itane chote str ke karmchaariyon se itnaa bada ghotaalaa sambhav nahin tha
 We cannot give a loan of ten crores
 hazaron karod kaa lone bina bade str ke adhikariyon kii milibhagat ke ho hi nahin saktaa
 All the information is coming from the sources, no one is giving complete information on this, just whose Nirav Modi was the tenant, who bought the diamond from it, the people are being seduced by all these things
 raksha mantri ko yah bataane ke liye aana padaa ki abhishek manu singhvi kii patni ne dedh karod kaa hira karidaa he
 Are they now going to tell who bought the diamond in all these years? kya wo is baat ko lekar aashwast hai ki unki party ke bade netaaon ne vahaan se hira nahin karidaa yaa netaaon ke bachche vahaan kaam nahin karte the
 What the Defense Minister wants to prove under the pretext of daughter and wife
 vaise ab jab pataa chal rahaa he ki neerav modi naam ke frod ne 10 rupee kaa hira 200 main bechaa he to ummid kii jaani chahie ki saare karidaar khud hi rote hue baahar aa jaaenge
 Whose people had given these diamond sets as gifts at weddings, now they will also be crying
 vaise agar nirmala sitaraman press conference karne ai thim to unhen yah bataakar janaa chahie tha ki agast 2016 main register of companez ne visal blor kii shikaayat ko kyon nirast kar diya tha
 While that complaint was forwarded by the PMO
 wo do baaten bataa den
 
 
 Whether a clerk or an officer decides to investigate and revoke a complaint when someone complains, on what basis they decide, she herself has been the Minister of Corporate Affairs
 yahi nahin santosh shrivastav ne 2013 main gitanjali limited se istifa diya or shikaayatein kin to mehul chaukasee ne bulaakar dhamkee di
 To date his salary was not paid
 farzi cese kiye jisamen santosh bari ho gaye
 The Economic Offenses Wing in its investigation did not find a single allegation true
 is bich mumbai main neerav modi ke ghar ke alaava surat ke teen or dilli ke ek thikaane par pravartan nideshaalay ke chaape pade hai
 On the other hand, the CBI also summoned Ravi Gupta, second chief financial officer of Nirav Modi's company, for questioning
 company ke ek or CFO vipul ambani se sibiai ravivaar se poochtacha kar rahi he
 Some suspended officials of the bank have also been questioned by the CBI
 punjab neshnal bank ghotaale ke centre main rahi mumbai kii brady house branch ko pehle sil kar diya gaya lekin baad main sibiai adhikari sil kholkar jaanch ke liye branch ke andar gaye
 Several bank officials were also called there for investigation and questioning
 isi branch se 11,400 karod ke is ghotaale kii buniyaad padi
 One of the main accused in this scam, Gokulnath Shetty, was the deputy manager of the same branch, which is now in CBI custody
 aarope he ki gokulanath shetty kii madad se hi letters of anderstanding jari kiye gaye jinaki madad se neerav modi ke liye videshon main duusare bainkon kii guarantee punjab neshnal bank ne lee
 How the scam was carried out and how many people were involved in it, speculation is going on at different levels right now
 Live Mint main tamal bandyopadhyaay ne apni report main is ghotaale ko samajhane kii koshish kii he
 First understand SWIFT i
e
 Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
 ek aisi vyavastha jisase duniya bhar ke bank aapas main ek code system ke zarie vittiya lenden se judi soochna or nirdeshon kaa surakshit aadan-pradaan karte hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay states in his article that at least three officers are needed to smash a bank through SWIFT
 mekar, chekar or verifir
 The maker is the one who inserts the swift-linked message into the system, the checker checks it, and on the third stage the verifier arrives which verifies after the message is satisfied with the check
 lekin teen hi kaafii nahin hai
 Because when a SWIFT message is sent to a bank abroad for financial transaction, that bank sends this message back to the first bank to confirm the loan
 pehle bank main ye massej us vyakti ke paas jaataa he to mekar, chekar or verifir se alag hota he
 This message comes in a secured room and is printed on a separate printer
 is room main jane kii ijazat bahut hi kam logon ko hoti he
 So the question arises whether Gokulnath Shetty played these four roles in Brady House Branch? Can it happen Experts say that this is not possible
 is maamle main kai or bade logon kii nishchit hi bhoomika hogi jo aage kii jaanch main saamne aegi
 Sheela Bhatt is an expert journalist, she has reported diamond business for 17 years from 1980 to 1997
 shilajee ne sande gardian akhbaar main ek report likhi he
 Translating a part of that report
 
 
 'surat main ek bada hira kaarobaari pichley chah maheene se 4000 karod se adhik ke qarz par koi byaaj nahin de rahaa he
 He has taken these loans from a private bank
 bank kii saans ataki hui he ki kahin wo dukaan band kar bhaag naa jaae
 This is the same man who gifted the car to all his employees a few years ago
 is kahani ko padhaa to ham bhi saham gaye
 
 
 We too had shown the story of one such diamond merchant
 kya vahi hira vyapaaree he jiske bare main shila bhatta ishaara kar rahi hai
 When he gifted the car, it was created in the media
 kya bhartiya kaarobaari bagair chori ke safalataa kaa mukaam hasil nahin kar sakate hai? shila bhatta se ek hira vyapaaree ne kaha he ki pachaas saal se heere kaa kaarobaar 90 fisadi blike mani par chalata he
 Obviously it must be going on even today
 
 
 unke lekh kaa ek or hissaa he, 'bade hira kaarobaariyon ko pataa tha ki mehul or neerav kaa dhandha chaupat hone vaala he lekin unhen bhi pataa nahin tha ki wo letters of anderteking ke sahare ye khel karenge
 It is all about telling the price of the goods, showing less in the bill, selling smuggling goods, tax evasion, but no one had the idea of letter of understanding
 in hira kaarobaariyon ko bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki neerav or mehul ne itane letters of anderteking kaise hasil kar liye
 ' is ghatana ne hira vyapaar ko hi andeh ke ghere main laa diya he
 The darkness behind its glow is telling us how naive we are
 chamak dikhaa kar chakma dene vaale abhi bhi sara maal bator le ja rahe hai
 Meanwhile, Quint Hindi editorial director and senior journalist Sanjay Puglia has tweeted that 'nirav Modi got his children removed from the schools in Mumbai six months ago when the school was in the middle of the session
 bachche apni maa ke saath america chale gaye
 Business families were surprised as to why this happened
 ab unhen vajah pataa lagi he
 ' to bhaagane kii puri taiyaari thi
 
 
 Our colleague Manas Pratap Singh has informed that Nirav Modi was an Indian citizen till March 2017 but since November 2017 he is an NRI and has given his address to Burj Khalifa in Dubai
 mehul chaukasee kahaan hai, kyon nahin pakad main aae hai, baaki logon se poochtacha ho rahi he, giraptari nahin hui he
 Employees of the bank were immediately arrested
 is par kaanoon mantri, maanav sansaadhan mantri, raksha mantri ke baad krishi kalyaan mantri press conference karne vaale hai
 It was learned that the entire cabinet held a press conference but Nirav and Mehul did not come
 is bich kendriya satarkta ayog yani sivisi ne punjab neshnal bank ke adhikariyon ko poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa
 
 
 The special thing is that this CVC has given Punjab National Bank three times in the last three years to be vigilant in banking
 iname se do aword pichley hi saal punjab neshnal bank ko die gaye jis saal pienbi ne neerav modi or unke parivaar ko 293 aloyu jari kiye
 This CVC should be asked only how it gives the Vigilance Award
 puraskaar dene kii isaki prakriya kya he
 This incident has shocked the image of the Vigilance Commission, provided that it does make a difference to anyone
 khud kendriya satarkta ayukta kevi choudhary ne ye aword apane haathon se die
 Now they are asking him why and how the mess happened
 unhen khud hi janata ke saamne aakar apni baat bataani chahie
 We write the truth by buying a pen made by businessman Vikram Kothari's company Rotomac, but the company Vikram Kothari is not able to pay 3695 crore
 inhone elahabaad bank, bank of india, bank of baroda, indian overseas bank, union bank of india se lone liya tha
 These banks gave loans to Vikram Kothari by following the rules
 lekin ab kothaari na to byaaj chukaa rahe hai naa mul
 Failing to repay the loan in February 2017, the banks declared him a willful defaulter, which was a deliberate inability to repay the loan
 iske baad kothaari or unke parivaar ke logon kii kai sampattiyon ko bainkon ne pichley saal nilaam karne kii karrwai shuru kii taaki apane bakaae kaa kuch hissaa vasuul kiya ja sake
 The rotomac company's office has been locked in the city center of Mall Road, Kanpur for several days
 bank of baroda kii shikaayat ke baad sibiai ne unke kilaaf exiaar daayar kii he or kanpur main unke teen thikaanon par chaape maare hai
 CBI officials are questioning Vikram Kothari, his wife and son
 isse pehle kaha gaya tha ki vikram kothaari bhi videsh bhaag gaye hai lekin ravivaar raat unhen kanpur main ek shaadi samaaroh main dekha gaya
 In response to questions about embezzlement, Kothari said that "I am not running away from the country
" kanpur kaa rahanevaala hum or yaheen rahoonga
 There is no better country than India
 unke mukh mandal se sunakar main saham gaya
 There is no better country than India in taking a loan or is there a better country than India
 darasal sabko pataa he ki hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Such investigation will continue to happen later all the time
 lone na chukaane ke sawaal par kothaari ne kaha ki 'bank se lone zarur liya he, lekin lone na chuktaa karne kii baat galat he
 The case is going on inside the National Company Law Tribunal of mine and the bank
 ' udhar kothaari ke vakil kaa kahana he ki agar koi bank kaa lone naa chukaa paae to ise frod nahin kaha janaa chahie, ye koi aparaadh nahin he
 a well known Pan masala brand Pan Parag belongs to the Vikram Kothari family
 pakora prakaran ke baad neerav modi prakaran ne logon kii kalpanashiltaa ko jagaa diya he
 He is writing all kinds of jogira about Modi
 ek ne likh bheja he ki qarz bhi kitna ajab he, amiron kaa bade to desh chhod jate hai, garibon kaa bade to deh chhod jate hai
 Meanwhile, reports have come that after Gitanjali Gems Limited's Compliance Officer Pankhudi Warange resigned after the scam was exposed, Chief Financial Officer Chandrakant Karkare resigned in the name of his ailing wife
 bihar main isi tarah kaa pichley saal agast main srijan ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The creation scam was also a banking scam
 2013 main hi bhartiya reserve bank ne likhaa tha ki srijan ke khate kii jaanch ho magar jaanch nahin hui, ghotaalaa chalata rahaa
 Now when the scam came to light, the case went to the CBI
 6 maheene se sibiai jaanch kar rahi he magar srijan ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee giraftaar tak nahin hue hai
 The comments hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar ne report file kii he ki abhi tak srijan ghotaale ke mukhya abhiyukt priya or amit faraar hai
 The CBI has not yet taken a warrant for his arrest
 1500 karod ke is ghotaale ko lekar sibiai kii yah raftaar he
 When the government's plans reached Bhagalpur, the District Magistrate used to cut the check and give it to the branch of Bank of Baroda, Bhagalpur, to deposit the money in the account of the institution called Srujan
 vahaan se paisa nikalataa tha or logon main bant jaataa tha
 This is such a scam, if it was investigated quickly, then other states would also be affected, but everything is growing like slow news
 bihar main sarkaar badal gai he or srijan ghotaale kii baat dhimi pad gai he
 If CBI could not arrest the main accused in 6 months then what to say, while CBI has so far filed 5 charge sheets, 2 supplementary charge sheets
 abhi to jaanch main tezi aa rahi he
 After two to three days when the focus of the media will change, the creation of the Punjab National Bank scam will also be similar to the creation scam
 bihar jaise garib rajya main koi 1500 karod lut le jaae or kisi ko fark hi na pade to garibon kaa bhagwaan hi maalik he
 The Defense Minister had to come to tell that Abhishek Manu Singhvi's wife had bought a diamond worth Rs 1
5 crore
 kya ab ve yah bhi bataane vaali hai ki itane saalon main kis kis ne hira karidaa
 Are they convinced that the big leaders of their party did not buy diamonds from there or that the children of the leaders did not work there
 beti or bivi ke bahaane raksha mantri kya sabit karnaa chaahati hai
 By the way, now that it is known that a fraud named Nirav Modi has sold a diamond of 10 rupees for 200, then it should be expected that all the buyers will come out crying themselves
 jinke yahaan shaadiyon main in logon ne heere kaa set tohfe main diya hoga ab ve bhi ro rahe honge
 By the way, if Nirmala Sitharaman had come to the press conference, she should have told why the Registrar of Companies had canceled the whistle blower complaint in August 2016
 jabaki wo shikaayat piemo ne forverd kii thi
 Let me tell you two things
 
 
 kya jab koi shikaayat karata he to uski jaanch or nirast karne kaa faisalaa koi clerk letaa he yaa koi adhikari letaa he, kis aadhaar par faisalaa hota he, ve khud bhi karporate maamalon ke mantri rahi hai
 Not only this, Santosh Srivastava resigned from Geetanjali Limited in 2013 and made complaints when Mehul Choksi called and threatened him
 unki selary kaa bakaayaa aaj tak nahin diya
 a fake case was done in which Santosh was acquitted
 aarthik aparaadh shakha ne apni jaanch main ek bhi aarope sahi nahin paaya
 Meanwhile, besides Nirav Modi's house in Mumbai, three Surat and one Delhi locations have been raided by the Enforcement Directorate
 udhar sibiai ne neerav modi kii company ke duusare cheef financial ofisar ravi gupta ko bhi poochtacha ke liye saman kiya
 The CBI is questioning Vipul Ambani, another CFO of the company, since Sunday
 bank ke kuch nilambit adhikariyon se bhi sibiai ne poochtacha kii he
 Mumbai's Brady House branch, which was at the center of the Punjab National Bank scam, was first sealed but later CBI officials opened the seal and went inside the branch for investigation
 kai bank adhikariyon ko bhi vahaan jaanch or poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 From this branch, the scam of 11,400 crores was laid
 is ghotaale kaa ek mukhya aaropee gokulanath shetty isi branch kaa dipti manager tha jo ab sibiai kii hiraasat main he
 It is alleged that the letter of understanding was issued with the help of Gokulnath Shetty, with the help of which Punjab National Bank guaranteed other banks abroad for Nirav Modi
 is ghotaale ko kaise anjaam diya gaya or isamen kul kitne logon kii sathganth thi ise lekar abhi alag alag staron par kayaas hi chal rahe hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay in Live Mint has tried to explain this scam in his report
 pehle SWIFT ko samajhie yani Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
 a system whereby banks around the world securely exchange information and instructions related to financial transactions through a code system among themselves
 tamal bandyopadhyaay apane lekh main kehete hai ki ki SWIFT ke zarie kisi bank ko dharashayi karne ke liye kam se kam teen adhikariyon kii zarurat hoti he
 Maker, Checker and Verifier
 mekar wo hota he jo system main SWIFT se judaa massej daalata he, chekar isaki jaanch karata he or teesri stage par verifir aata he jo massej kii jaanch se santusht hone ke baad veriphai karata he
 But three are not enough
 kyonki vittiya lenden ke liye SWIFT massej jab videsh main kisi bank ko bheja jaataa he to wo bank lone ko conform karne ke liye is massej ko waapas pehle bank main bhejtaa he
 In the first bank, this message goes to the person, then it is different from the maker, checker and the verifier
 ye massej ek secyord room main aata he or ek alag printer par print hota he
 Very few people are allowed to visit this room
 to sawaal ye uthta he ki kya brady house branch main gokulanath shetty ne ye chaaron bhoomikaayen nibhaain? kya aisa ho saktaa he? jaankaron kaa kahana he ki ye sambhav nahin he
 Many bigger people will definitely have a role in this matter which will come up in further investigation
 shila bhatta maahir patrkaar hai, unhone 1980 se 1997 tak yani 17 saal hira kaarobaar kii report kii he
 Sheelaji has written a report in the Sunday Guardian newspaper
 us report ke ek hisse kaa anuwaad kar rahaa hum
 
 
 'A large diamond trader in Surat has not been paying any interest on the loan of more than 4000 crores for the last six months
 usne yah lone privet bank se liye hai
 The bank's breath is stuck so that it does not run away from the shop
 yah vahi aadmi he jisane kuch saal pehle apane sabhi karmchaariyon ko car tohafe main di thi
 When we read this story, we too were stunned
 
 
 hamane bhi ek aise hira vyapaaree kii kahani dikhaai thi
 Is he the same diamond merchant about whom Sheela Bhatt is pointing? jab usne car gift kii thi tab media main uski dhooma much gai thi
 Can Indian businessmen not achieve success without theft? a diamond trader from Sheela Bhatt has said that for fifty years, diamond business runs at 90 per cent black money
 zaahir he aaj bhi chal hi rahaa hoga
 
 
 Another part of their article is, 'big diamond businessmen knew that the business of Mehul and Nirav was going to collapse, but they did not even know that they would do this game with the help of letter of undertaking
 maal kii qeemat zyaada bataanaa, bill main kam dikhaanaa, smagaling kaa maal kareednaa bechnaa, tex chori karnaa yah sab to chalata he magar letters of anderstanding kaa idia kisi ko nahin tha
 Even these diamond traders do not understand how Nirav and Mehul achieved such a letter of undertaking
 ' This incident has brought the diamond trade in doubt
 isaki chamak ke peeche kaa andhera bataa rahaa he ki ham sab kitne bhole hai
 By dazzling, the hoaxers are still collecting all the goods
 is bich quint hindi ke sampadakeey nideshak or varisht patrkaar sanjay pugaliya ne twit kiya he ki 'neerav modi ne apane bacchon kaa mumbai ke skulon se chah maheene pehle hi naam katwa liya tha jab skool satr ke bich main hi the
 The children moved to America with their mother
 kaarobaari parivaar hairaan the ki aisa kyon hua
 Now they know the reason
 ' So there was complete preparation to escape
 
 
 hamaare sahyogi maanas pratap singh ne jaankaree di he ki neerav modi march 2017 tak bhartiya naagarik tha lekin november 2017 se wo enarai he or usne apana pataa dubai main burj caliph kaa diya he
 Where is Mehul Chowki, why have not he been caught, the rest of the people are being questioned, no arrests have been made
 bank ke karmchaaree to turant giraftaar ho gaye hai
 Law Minister, Human Resource Minister, Defense Minister and Agriculture Welfare Minister are going to press conference on this
 pataa chalaa ki sara mantrimandal press conference kar gaya magar neerav or mehul nahin aae
 Meanwhile, Central Vigilance Commission i
e
 CVC called Punjab National Bank officials for questioning
 
 
 khaas baat ye he ki isi sivisi ne beete teen saal main teen baar banking main satarkta baratane ke liye punjab neshnal bank ko aword diye hai
 Two of these awards were given to Punjab National Bank last year, the year in which PNB issued 293 lous to Nirav Modi and his family
 is sivisi se hi poocha janaa chahie ki wo satarkta puraskaar kaise detaa he
 What is its process of awarding
 is ghatana se satarkta ayog kii chhavi ko kitna dhakka pahunchaa he, basharte is dhakke se kisi ko fark padataa ho
 Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary presented the awards with his own hands
 ab vahi unase puch rahe hai ki gadabadi kyon or kaise ho gai
 They should themselves come out in front of the public and tell their views
 kaarobaari vikram kothaari kii company rotomac kii banaai kalam kareed kar ham log sach likhte hai magar company vaale vikram kothaari 3695 karod nahin chukaa paa rahe hai
 He took loans from Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India
 in bainkon ne niyamon ko taak par rakhkar vikram kothaari ko lone diya
 But now Kothari is neither paying interest nor origin
 farvari 2017 main lone chukaane main naakaam rahane par bainkon ne unhen vilphul difolter ghoshit kiya yani jo jaanboojhkar lone chukaane main asamarthta jataae
 After this, banks started the auction of various properties of Kothari and his family members last year to recover some of their dues
 kanpur ke maal road ke city centre main rotomac company ke ofis par kai dinon se taala band he
 Following the complaint of the Bank of Baroda, the CBI has filed an FIR against him and raided his three locations in Kanpur
 vikram kothaari, unki patni or bete se sibiai ke afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Earlier it was said that Vikram Kothari has also fled abroad but he was seen at a wedding ceremony in Kanpur on Sunday night
 gaban ko lekar sawaalon ke jawaab main kothaari ne kaha ki 'main desh chhodkar bhaag nahin rahaa hum
 i am from Kanpur and will live here
 bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 i was aghast after hearing from his mouth
 lone lekar gaban karne main bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he yaa vaaki bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 Actually everyone knows that it is nothing to be
 aise hi jaanch vaanch hoti rahegi baad main sab rafa dfa
 On the question of not repaying the loan, Kothari said that 'I have taken a loan from the bank, but it is wrong to not repay the loan
 meraa or bank kaa neshnal company lau tribunel ke andar cese chal rahaa he
 On the other hand, Kothari's lawyer says that if a bank does not repay the loan, it should not be called fraud, it is not a crime
 ek janaa pahachaanaa paan masala brands paan paraag vikram kothaari parivaar kaa hi he
 The Nirav Modi episode after the Pakoda episode has awakened people's imagination
 wo modi ko lekar tarah-tarah kaa jogira sara raara likh rahe hai
 One has written that the debt is so strange, if the rich grow, they leave the country, and if the poor grow, they leave the body
 is bich khabar ai he ki ghotaale ke ujagar hone ke baad gitanjali james limited kii complayens adhikari pankhudi warrange ne antaratma kii awaz par or chif financial afasar chandrakant karkare ne biimaar patni ke naam par istipha de diya he
 a similar creation scandal came to light in Bihar in August last year
 srijan ghotaalaa bhi banking ghotaalaa tha
 In 2013 itself, the Reserve Bank of India wrote that the creation account should be investigated but not investigated, the scam continued
 ab jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to maamla sibiai ke paas gaya
 The CBI has been investigating for 6 months but the main accused in the creation scam have not even been arrested
 tippaniyan Our colleague Manish Kumar has filed a report that so far the main accused in the creation scam are Priya and Amit absconding
 sibiai ne abhi tak giraftaar ke liye warrant tak nahin liya he
 This is the speed of CBI regarding this 1500 crore scam
 sarkaar kii yojanaayen jab bhagalpur pahunchati thim to ziladhikari check kaat kar bhagalpur ke bank of baroda kii shakha ko dete the ki paisa srijan naam kii sanstha ke khate main jamaa kara diya jaae
 Money used to flow from there and was distributed among the people
 yah aisa ghotaalaa he agar isaki tezi se jaanch hoti to duusare rajyon par bhi asar padataa magar sab kuch dhimi gati ke samachar kii tarah bad rahaa he
 The government has changed in Bihar and the creation scandal has slowed down
 6 maheene main sibiai mukhya abhiyukt ko giraftaar na kar sake to kya kaha jaae jabaki sibiai abhi tak 5 chargeshit, 2 supplementry chargeshit daayar kar chuki he
 Right now the investigation is taking place
 do teen dinon baad jab media kaa focus badalegaa to punjab neshnal bank ke ghotaale kaa haal bhi srijan ghotaale ke jaisaa ho jayega
 In a poor state like Bihar, if someone takes 1500 crores of loot, and no matter what, then God is the owner of the poor
 yahi nahin santosh shrivastav ne 2013 main gitanjali limited se istifa diya or shikaayatein kin to mehul chaukasee ne bulaakar dhamkee di
 To date his salary was not paid
 farzi cese kiye jisamen santosh bari ho gaye
 The Economic Offenses Wing in its investigation did not find a single allegation true
 is bich mumbai main neerav modi ke ghar ke alaava surat ke teen or dilli ke ek thikaane par pravartan nideshaalay ke chaape pade hai
 On the other hand, the CBI also summoned Ravi Gupta, second chief financial officer of Nirav Modi's company, for questioning
 company ke ek or CFO vipul ambani se sibiai ravivaar se poochtacha kar rahi he
 Some suspended officials of the bank have also been questioned by the CBI
 punjab neshnal bank ghotaale ke centre main rahi mumbai kii brady house branch ko pehle sil kar diya gaya lekin baad main sibiai adhikari sil kholkar jaanch ke liye branch ke andar gaye
 Several bank officials were also called there for investigation and questioning
 isi branch se 11,400 karod ke is ghotaale kii buniyaad padi
 One of the main accused in this scam, Gokulnath Shetty, was the deputy manager of the same branch, which is now in CBI custody
 aarope he ki gokulanath shetty kii madad se hi letters of anderstanding jari kiye gaye jinaki madad se neerav modi ke liye videshon main duusare bainkon kii guarantee punjab neshnal bank ne lee
 How the scam was carried out and how many people were involved in it, speculation is going on at different levels right now
 Live Mint main tamal bandyopadhyaay ne apni report main is ghotaale ko samajhane kii koshish kii he
 First understand SWIFT i
e
 Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
 ek aisi vyavastha jisase duniya bhar ke bank aapas main ek code system ke zarie vittiya lenden se judi soochna or nirdeshon kaa surakshit aadan-pradaan karte hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay states in his article that at least three officers are needed to smash a bank through SWIFT
 mekar, chekar or verifir
 The maker is the one who inserts the swift-linked message into the system, the checker checks it, and on the third stage the verifier arrives which verifies after the message is satisfied with the check
 lekin teen hi kaafii nahin hai
 Because when a SWIFT message is sent to a bank abroad for financial transaction, that bank sends this message back to the first bank to confirm the loan
 pehle bank main ye massej us vyakti ke paas jaataa he to mekar, chekar or verifir se alag hota he
 This message comes in a secured room and is printed on a separate printer
 is room main jane kii ijazat bahut hi kam logon ko hoti he
 So the question arises whether Gokulnath Shetty played these four roles in Brady House Branch? Can it happen Experts say that this is not possible
 is maamle main kai or bade logon kii nishchit hi bhoomika hogi jo aage kii jaanch main saamne aegi
 Sheela Bhatt is an expert journalist, she has reported diamond business for 17 years from 1980 to 1997
 shilajee ne sande gardian akhbaar main ek report likhi he
 Translating a part of that report
 
 
 'surat main ek bada hira kaarobaari pichley chah maheene se 4000 karod se adhik ke qarz par koi byaaj nahin de rahaa he
 He has taken these loans from a private bank
 bank kii saans ataki hui he ki kahin wo dukaan band kar bhaag naa jaae
 This is the same man who gifted the car to all his employees a few years ago
 is kahani ko padhaa to ham bhi saham gaye
 
 
 We too had shown the story of one such diamond merchant
 kya vahi hira vyapaaree he jiske bare main shila bhatta ishaara kar rahi hai
 When he gifted the car, it was created in the media
 kya bhartiya kaarobaari bagair chori ke safalataa kaa mukaam hasil nahin kar sakate hai? shila bhatta se ek hira vyapaaree ne kaha he ki pachaas saal se heere kaa kaarobaar 90 fisadi blike mani par chalata he
 Obviously it must be going on even today
 
 
 unke lekh kaa ek or hissaa he, 'bade hira kaarobaariyon ko pataa tha ki mehul or neerav kaa dhandha chaupat hone vaala he lekin unhen bhi pataa nahin tha ki wo letters of anderteking ke sahare ye khel karenge
 It is all about telling the price of the goods, showing less in the bill, selling smuggling goods, tax evasion, but no one had the idea of letter of understanding
 in hira kaarobaariyon ko bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki neerav or mehul ne itane letters of anderteking kaise hasil kar liye
 ' is ghatana ne hira vyapaar ko hi andeh ke ghere main laa diya he
 The darkness behind its glow is telling us how naive we are
 chamak dikhaa kar chakma dene vaale abhi bhi sara maal bator le ja rahe hai
 Meanwhile, Quint Hindi editorial director and senior journalist Sanjay Puglia has tweeted that 'nirav Modi got his children removed from the schools in Mumbai six months ago when the school was in the middle of the session
 bachche apni maa ke saath america chale gaye
 Business families were surprised as to why this happened
 ab unhen vajah pataa lagi he
 ' to bhaagane kii puri taiyaari thi
 
 
 Our colleague Manas Pratap Singh has informed that Nirav Modi was an Indian citizen till March 2017 but since November 2017 he is an NRI and has given his address to Burj Khalifa in Dubai
 mehul chaukasee kahaan hai, kyon nahin pakad main aae hai, baaki logon se poochtacha ho rahi he, giraptari nahin hui he
 Employees of the bank were immediately arrested
 is par kaanoon mantri, maanav sansaadhan mantri, raksha mantri ke baad krishi kalyaan mantri press conference karne vaale hai
 It was learned that the entire cabinet held a press conference but Nirav and Mehul did not come
 is bich kendriya satarkta ayog yani sivisi ne punjab neshnal bank ke adhikariyon ko poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa
 
 
 The special thing is that this CVC has given Punjab National Bank three times in the last three years to be vigilant in banking
 iname se do aword pichley hi saal punjab neshnal bank ko die gaye jis saal pienbi ne neerav modi or unke parivaar ko 293 aloyu jari kiye
 This CVC should be asked only how it gives the Vigilance Award
 puraskaar dene kii isaki prakriya kya he
 This incident has shocked the image of the Vigilance Commission, provided that it does make a difference to anyone
 khud kendriya satarkta ayukta kevi choudhary ne ye aword apane haathon se die
 Now they are asking him why and how the mess happened
 unhen khud hi janata ke saamne aakar apni baat bataani chahie
 We write the truth by buying a pen made by businessman Vikram Kothari's company Rotomac, but the company Vikram Kothari is not able to pay 3695 crore
 inhone elahabaad bank, bank of india, bank of baroda, indian overseas bank, union bank of india se lone liya tha
 These banks gave loans to Vikram Kothari by following the rules
 lekin ab kothaari na to byaaj chukaa rahe hai naa mul
 Failing to repay the loan in February 2017, the banks declared him a willful defaulter, which was a deliberate inability to repay the loan
 iske baad kothaari or unke parivaar ke logon kii kai sampattiyon ko bainkon ne pichley saal nilaam karne kii karrwai shuru kii taaki apane bakaae kaa kuch hissaa vasuul kiya ja sake
 The rotomac company's office has been locked in the city center of Mall Road, Kanpur for several days
 bank of baroda kii shikaayat ke baad sibiai ne unke kilaaf exiaar daayar kii he or kanpur main unke teen thikaanon par chaape maare hai
 CBI officials are questioning Vikram Kothari, his wife and son
 isse pehle kaha gaya tha ki vikram kothaari bhi videsh bhaag gaye hai lekin ravivaar raat unhen kanpur main ek shaadi samaaroh main dekha gaya
 In response to questions about embezzlement, Kothari said that "I am not running away from the country
" kanpur kaa rahanevaala hum or yaheen rahoonga
 There is no better country than India
 unke mukh mandal se sunakar main saham gaya
 There is no better country than India in taking a loan or is there a better country than India
 darasal sabko pataa he ki hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Such investigation will continue to happen later all the time
 lone na chukaane ke sawaal par kothaari ne kaha ki 'bank se lone zarur liya he, lekin lone na chuktaa karne kii baat galat he
 The case is going on inside the National Company Law Tribunal of mine and the bank
 ' udhar kothaari ke vakil kaa kahana he ki agar koi bank kaa lone naa chukaa paae to ise frod nahin kaha janaa chahie, ye koi aparaadh nahin he
 a well known Pan masala brand Pan Parag belongs to the Vikram Kothari family
 pakora prakaran ke baad neerav modi prakaran ne logon kii kalpanashiltaa ko jagaa diya he
 He is writing all kinds of jogira about Modi
 ek ne likh bheja he ki qarz bhi kitna ajab he, amiron kaa bade to desh chhod jate hai, garibon kaa bade to deh chhod jate hai
 Meanwhile, reports have come that after Gitanjali Gems Limited's Compliance Officer Pankhudi Warange resigned after the scam was exposed, Chief Financial Officer Chandrakant Karkare resigned in the name of his ailing wife
 bihar main isi tarah kaa pichley saal agast main srijan ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The creation scam was also a banking scam
 2013 main hi bhartiya reserve bank ne likhaa tha ki srijan ke khate kii jaanch ho magar jaanch nahin hui, ghotaalaa chalata rahaa
 Now when the scam came to light, the case went to the CBI
 6 maheene se sibiai jaanch kar rahi he magar srijan ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee giraftaar tak nahin hue hai
 The comments hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar ne report file kii he ki abhi tak srijan ghotaale ke mukhya abhiyukt priya or amit faraar hai
 The CBI has not yet taken a warrant for his arrest
 1500 karod ke is ghotaale ko lekar sibiai kii yah raftaar he
 When the government's plans reached Bhagalpur, the District Magistrate used to cut the check and give it to the branch of Bank of Baroda, Bhagalpur, to deposit the money in the account of the institution called Srujan
 vahaan se paisa nikalataa tha or logon main bant jaataa tha
 This is such a scam, if it was investigated quickly, then other states would also be affected, but everything is growing like slow news
 bihar main sarkaar badal gai he or srijan ghotaale kii baat dhimi pad gai he
 If CBI could not arrest the main accused in 6 months then what to say, while CBI has so far filed 5 charge sheets, 2 supplementary charge sheets
 abhi to jaanch main tezi aa rahi he
 After two to three days when the focus of the media will change, the creation of the Punjab National Bank scam will also be similar to the creation scam
 bihar jaise garib rajya main koi 1500 karod lut le jaae or kisi ko fark hi na pade to garibon kaa bhagwaan hi maalik he
 Meanwhile, besides Nirav Modi's house in Mumbai, three Surat and one Delhi locations have been raided by the Enforcement Directorate
 udhar sibiai ne neerav modi kii company ke duusare cheef financial ofisar ravi gupta ko bhi poochtacha ke liye saman kiya
 The CBI is questioning Vipul Ambani, another CFO of the company, since Sunday
 bank ke kuch nilambit adhikariyon se bhi sibiai ne poochtacha kii he
 Mumbai's Brady House branch, which was at the center of the Punjab National Bank scam, was first sealed but later CBI officials opened the seal and went inside the branch for investigation
 kai bank adhikariyon ko bhi vahaan jaanch or poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa gaya
 From this branch, the scam of 11,400 crores was laid
 is ghotaale kaa ek mukhya aaropee gokulanath shetty isi branch kaa dipti manager tha jo ab sibiai kii hiraasat main he
 It is alleged that the letter of understanding was issued with the help of Gokulnath Shetty, with the help of which Punjab National Bank guaranteed other banks abroad for Nirav Modi
 is ghotaale ko kaise anjaam diya gaya or isamen kul kitne logon kii sathganth thi ise lekar abhi alag alag staron par kayaas hi chal rahe hai
 Tamal Bandyopadhyay in Live Mint has tried to explain this scam in his report
 pehle SWIFT ko samajhie yani Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
 a system whereby banks around the world securely exchange information and instructions related to financial transactions through a code system among themselves
 tamal bandyopadhyaay apane lekh main kehete hai ki ki SWIFT ke zarie kisi bank ko dharashayi karne ke liye kam se kam teen adhikariyon kii zarurat hoti he
 Maker, Checker and Verifier
 mekar wo hota he jo system main SWIFT se judaa massej daalata he, chekar isaki jaanch karata he or teesri stage par verifir aata he jo massej kii jaanch se santusht hone ke baad veriphai karata he
 But three are not enough
 kyonki vittiya lenden ke liye SWIFT massej jab videsh main kisi bank ko bheja jaataa he to wo bank lone ko conform karne ke liye is massej ko waapas pehle bank main bhejtaa he
 In the first bank, this message goes to the person, then it is different from the maker, checker and the verifier
 ye massej ek secyord room main aata he or ek alag printer par print hota he
 Very few people are allowed to visit this room
 to sawaal ye uthta he ki kya brady house branch main gokulanath shetty ne ye chaaron bhoomikaayen nibhaain? kya aisa ho saktaa he? jaankaron kaa kahana he ki ye sambhav nahin he
 Many bigger people will definitely have a role in this matter which will come up in further investigation
 shila bhatta maahir patrkaar hai, unhone 1980 se 1997 tak yani 17 saal hira kaarobaar kii report kii he
 Sheelaji has written a report in the Sunday Guardian newspaper
 us report ke ek hisse kaa anuwaad kar rahaa hum
 
 
 'A large diamond trader in Surat has not been paying any interest on the loan of more than 4000 crores for the last six months
 usne yah lone privet bank se liye hai
 The bank's breath is stuck so that it does not run away from the shop
 yah vahi aadmi he jisane kuch saal pehle apane sabhi karmchaariyon ko car tohafe main di thi
 When we read this story, we too were stunned
 
 
 hamane bhi ek aise hira vyapaaree kii kahani dikhaai thi
 Is he the same diamond merchant about whom Sheela Bhatt is pointing? jab usne car gift kii thi tab media main uski dhooma much gai thi
 Can Indian businessmen not achieve success without theft? a diamond trader from Sheela Bhatt has said that for fifty years, diamond business runs at 90 per cent black money
 zaahir he aaj bhi chal hi rahaa hoga
 
 
 Another part of their article is, 'big diamond businessmen knew that the business of Mehul and Nirav was going to collapse, but they did not even know that they would do this game with the help of letter of undertaking

 Even these diamond traders do not understand how Nirav and Mehul achieved such a letter of undertaking
 ' This incident has brought the diamond trade in doubt
 isaki chamak ke peeche kaa andhera bataa rahaa he ki ham sab kitne bhole hai
 By dazzling, the hoaxers are still collecting all the goods
 is bich quint hindi ke sampadakeey nideshak or varisht patrkaar sanjay pugaliya ne twit kiya he ki 'neerav modi ne apane bacchon kaa mumbai ke skulon se chah maheene pehle hi naam katwa liya tha jab skool satr ke bich main hi the

 hamaare sahyogi maanas pratap singh ne jaankaree di he ki neerav modi march 2017 tak bhartiya naagarik tha lekin november 2017 se wo enarai he or usne apana pataa dubai main burj caliph kaa diya he
 Where is Mehul Chowki, why have not he been caught, the rest of the people are being questioned, no arrests have been made

 khaas baat ye he ki isi sivisi ne beete teen saal main teen baar banking main satarkta baratane ke liye punjab neshnal bank ko aword diye hai
 Two of these awards were given to Punjab National Bank last year, the year in which PNB issued 293 lous to Nirav Modi and his family
 is sivisi se hi poocha janaa chahie ki wo satarkta puraskaar kaise detaa he
 What is its process of awarding
 is ghatana se satarkta ayog kii chhavi ko kitna dhakka pahunchaa he, basharte is dhakke se kisi ko fark padataa ho
 Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary presented the awards with his own hands
 ab vahi unase puch rahe hai ki gadabadi kyon or kaise ho gai
 They should themselves come out in front of the public and tell their views
 kaarobaari vikram kothaari kii company rotomac kii banaai kalam kareed kar ham log sach likhte hai magar company vaale vikram kothaari 3695 karod nahin chukaa paa rahe hai
 He took loans from Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India
 in bainkon ne niyamon ko taak par rakhkar vikram kothaari ko lone diya
 But now Kothari is neither paying interest nor origin
 farvari 2017 main lone chukaane main naakaam rahane par bainkon ne unhen vilphul difolter ghoshit kiya yani jo jaanboojhkar lone chukaane main asamarthta jataae
 After this, banks started the auction of various properties of Kothari and his family members last year to recover some of their dues
 kanpur ke maal road ke city centre main rotomac company ke ofis par kai dinon se taala band he
 Following the complaint of the Bank of Baroda, the CBI has filed an FIR against him and raided his three locations in Kanpur
 vikram kothaari, unki patni or bete se sibiai ke afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Earlier it was said that Vikram Kothari has also fled abroad but he was seen at a wedding ceremony in Kanpur on Sunday night
 gaban ko lekar sawaalon ke jawaab main kothaari ne kaha ki 'main desh chhodkar bhaag nahin rahaa hum
 i am from Kanpur and will live here
 bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 i was aghast after hearing from his mouth

 Actually everyone knows that it is nothing to be
 aise hi jaanch vaanch hoti rahegi baad main sab rafa dfa
 On the question of not repaying the loan, Kothari said that 'I have taken a loan from the bank, but it is wrong to not repay the loan
 meraa or bank kaa neshnal company lau tribunel ke andar cese chal rahaa he
 On the other hand, Kothari's lawyer says that if a bank does not repay the loan, it should not be called fraud, it is not a crime

 a similar creation scandal came to light in Bihar in August last year
 srijan ghotaalaa bhi banking ghotaalaa tha
 In 2013 itself, the Reserve Bank of India wrote that the creation account should be investigated but not investigated, the scam continued
 ab jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to maamla sibiai ke paas gaya
 The CBI has been investigating for 6 months but the main accused in the creation scam have not even been arrested
 tippaniyan Our colleague Manish Kumar has filed a report that so far the main accused in the creation scam are Priya and Amit absconding
 sibiai ne abhi tak giraftaar ke liye warrant tak nahin liya he
 This is the speed of CBI regarding this 1500 crore scam
 sarkaar kii yojanaayen jab bhagalpur pahunchati thim to ziladhikari check kaat kar bhagalpur ke bank of baroda kii shakha ko dete the ki paisa srijan naam kii sanstha ke khate main jamaa kara diya jaae
 Money used to flow from there and was distributed among the people
 yah aisa ghotaalaa he agar isaki tezi se jaanch hoti to duusare rajyon par bhi asar padataa magar sab kuch dhimi gati ke samachar kii tarah bad rahaa he
 The government has changed in Bihar and the creation scandal has slowed down
 6 maheene main sibiai mukhya abhiyukt ko giraftaar na kar sake to kya kaha jaae jabaki sibiai abhi tak 5 chargeshit, 2 supplementry chargeshit daayar kar chuki he
 Right now the investigation is taking place

 In 2013 itself, the Reserve Bank of India wrote that the creation account should be investigated but not investigated, the scam continued
 ab jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to maamla sibiai ke paas gaya
 The CBI has been investigating for 6 months but the main accused in the creation scam have not even been arrested
 tippaniyan Our colleague Manish Kumar has filed a report that so far the main accused in the creation scam are Priya and Amit absconding
 sibiai ne abhi tak giraftaar ke liye warrant tak nahin liya he
 This is the speed of CBI regarding this 1500 crore scam
 sarkaar kii yojanaayen jab bhagalpur pahunchati thim to ziladhikari check kaat kar bhagalpur ke bank of baroda kii shakha ko dete the ki paisa srijan naam kii sanstha ke khate main jamaa kara diya jaae
 Money used to flow from there and was distributed among the people
 yah aisa ghotaalaa he agar isaki tezi se jaanch hoti to duusare rajyon par bhi asar padataa magar sab kuch dhimi gati ke samachar kii tarah bad rahaa he
 The government has changed in Bihar and the creation scandal has slowed down
 6 maheene main sibiai mukhya abhiyukt ko giraftaar na kar sake to kya kaha jaae jabaki sibiai abhi tak 5 chargeshit, 2 supplementry chargeshit daayar kar chuki he
 Right now the investigation is taking place
 do teen dinon baad jab media kaa focus badalegaa to punjab neshnal bank ke ghotaale kaa haal bhi srijan ghotaale ke jaisaa ho jayega
 In a poor state like Bihar, if someone takes 1500 crores of loot, and no matter what, then God is the owner of the poor
 'surat main ek bada hira kaarobaari pichley chah maheene se 4000 karod se adhik ke qarz par koi byaaj nahin de rahaa he
 He has taken these loans from a private bank
 bank kii saans ataki hui he ki kahin wo dukaan band kar bhaag naa jaae
 This is the same man who gifted the car to all his employees a few years ago
 is kahani ko padhaa to ham bhi saham gaye
 
 
 We too had shown the story of one such diamond merchant
 kya vahi hira vyapaaree he jiske bare main shila bhatta ishaara kar rahi hai
 When he gifted the car, it was created in the media
 kya bhartiya kaarobaari bagair chori ke safalataa kaa mukaam hasil nahin kar sakate hai? shila bhatta se ek hira vyapaaree ne kaha he ki pachaas saal se heere kaa kaarobaar 90 fisadi blike mani par chalata he
 Obviously it must be going on even today
 
 
 unke lekh kaa ek or hissaa he, 'bade hira kaarobaariyon ko pataa tha ki mehul or neerav kaa dhandha chaupat hone vaala he lekin unhen bhi pataa nahin tha ki wo letters of anderteking ke sahare ye khel karenge
 It is all about telling the price of the goods, showing less in the bill, selling smuggling goods, tax evasion, but no one had the idea of letter of understanding
 in hira kaarobaariyon ko bhi samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki neerav or mehul ne itane letters of anderteking kaise hasil kar liye
 ' is ghatana ne hira vyapaar ko hi andeh ke ghere main laa diya he
 The darkness behind its glow is telling us how naive we are
 chamak dikhaa kar chakma dene vaale abhi bhi sara maal bator le ja rahe hai
 Meanwhile, Quint Hindi editorial director and senior journalist Sanjay Puglia has tweeted that 'nirav Modi got his children removed from the schools in Mumbai six months ago when the school was in the middle of the session
 bachche apni maa ke saath america chale gaye
 Business families were surprised as to why this happened
 ab unhen vajah pataa lagi he

 Our colleague Manas Pratap Singh has informed that Nirav Modi was an Indian citizen till March 2017 but since November 2017 he is an NRI and has given his address to Burj Khalifa in Dubai

 Employees of the bank were immediately arrested

 It was learned that the entire cabinet held a press conference but Nirav and Mehul did not come
 is bich kendriya satarkta ayog yani sivisi ne punjab neshnal bank ke adhikariyon ko poochtacha ke liye bulaayaa
 
 
 The special thing is that this CVC has given Punjab National Bank three times in the last three years to be vigilant in banking
 iname se do aword pichley hi saal punjab neshnal bank ko die gaye jis saal pienbi ne neerav modi or unke parivaar ko 293 aloyu jari kiye
 This CVC should be asked only how it gives the Vigilance Award
 puraskaar dene kii isaki prakriya kya he
 This incident has shocked the image of the Vigilance Commission, provided that it does make a difference to anyone
 khud kendriya satarkta ayukta kevi choudhary ne ye aword apane haathon se die
 Now they are asking him why and how the mess happened
 unhen khud hi janata ke saamne aakar apni baat bataani chahie
 We write the truth by buying a pen made by businessman Vikram Kothari's company Rotomac, but the company Vikram Kothari is not able to pay 3695 crore
 inhone elahabaad bank, bank of india, bank of baroda, indian overseas bank, union bank of india se lone liya tha
 These banks gave loans to Vikram Kothari by following the rules
 lekin ab kothaari na to byaaj chukaa rahe hai naa mul
 Failing to repay the loan in February 2017, the banks declared him a willful defaulter, which was a deliberate inability to repay the loan
 iske baad kothaari or unke parivaar ke logon kii kai sampattiyon ko bainkon ne pichley saal nilaam karne kii karrwai shuru kii taaki apane bakaae kaa kuch hissaa vasuul kiya ja sake
 The rotomac company's office has been locked in the city center of Mall Road, Kanpur for several days
 bank of baroda kii shikaayat ke baad sibiai ne unke kilaaf exiaar daayar kii he or kanpur main unke teen thikaanon par chaape maare hai
 CBI officials are questioning Vikram Kothari, his wife and son
 isse pehle kaha gaya tha ki vikram kothaari bhi videsh bhaag gaye hai lekin ravivaar raat unhen kanpur main ek shaadi samaaroh main dekha gaya
 In response to questions about embezzlement, Kothari said that "I am not running away from the country
" kanpur kaa rahanevaala hum or yaheen rahoonga
 There is no better country than India
 unke mukh mandal se sunakar main saham gaya
 There is no better country than India in taking a loan or is there a better country than India
 darasal sabko pataa he ki hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Such investigation will continue to happen later all the time
 lone na chukaane ke sawaal par kothaari ne kaha ki 'bank se lone zarur liya he, lekin lone na chuktaa karne kii baat galat he
 The case is going on inside the National Company Law Tribunal of mine and the bank
 ' udhar kothaari ke vakil kaa kahana he ki agar koi bank kaa lone naa chukaa paae to ise frod nahin kaha janaa chahie, ye koi aparaadh nahin he
 a well known Pan masala brand Pan Parag belongs to the Vikram Kothari family
 pakora prakaran ke baad neerav modi prakaran ne logon kii kalpanashiltaa ko jagaa diya he
 He is writing all kinds of jogira about Modi
 ek ne likh bheja he ki qarz bhi kitna ajab he, amiron kaa bade to desh chhod jate hai, garibon kaa bade to deh chhod jate hai
 Meanwhile, reports have come that after Gitanjali Gems Limited's Compliance Officer Pankhudi Warange resigned after the scam was exposed, Chief Financial Officer Chandrakant Karkare resigned in the name of his ailing wife
 bihar main isi tarah kaa pichley saal agast main srijan ghotaalaa saamne aayaa tha
 The creation scam was also a banking scam
 2013 main hi bhartiya reserve bank ne likhaa tha ki srijan ke khate kii jaanch ho magar jaanch nahin hui, ghotaalaa chalata rahaa
 Now when the scam came to light, the case went to the CBI
 6 maheene se sibiai jaanch kar rahi he magar srijan ghotaale ke mukhya aaropee giraftaar tak nahin hue hai
 The comments hamaare sahyogi manish kumaar ne report file kii he ki abhi tak srijan ghotaale ke mukhya abhiyukt priya or amit faraar hai
 The CBI has not yet taken a warrant for his arrest
 1500 karod ke is ghotaale ko lekar sibiai kii yah raftaar he
 When the government's plans reached Bhagalpur, the District Magistrate used to cut the check and give it to the branch of Bank of Baroda, Bhagalpur, to deposit the money in the account of the institution called Srujan
 vahaan se paisa nikalataa tha or logon main bant jaataa tha
 This is such a scam, if it was investigated quickly, then other states would also be affected, but everything is growing like slow news
 bihar main sarkaar badal gai he or srijan ghotaale kii baat dhimi pad gai he
 If CBI could not arrest the main accused in 6 months then what to say, while CBI has so far filed 5 charge sheets, 2 supplementary charge sheets
 abhi to jaanch main tezi aa rahi he
 After two to three days when the focus of the media will change, the creation of the Punjab National Bank scam will also be similar to the creation scam
 bihar jaise garib rajya main koi 1500 karod lut le jaae or kisi ko fark hi na pade to garibon kaa bhagwaan hi maalik he
 When we read this story, we too were stunned
 
 
 hamane bhi ek aise hira vyapaaree kii kahani dikhaai thi
 Is he the same diamond merchant about whom Sheela Bhatt is pointing? jab usne car gift kii thi tab media main uski dhooma much gai thi
 Can Indian businessmen not achieve success without theft? a diamond trader from Sheela Bhatt has said that for fifty years, diamond business runs at 90 per cent black money
 zaahir he aaj bhi chal hi rahaa hoga
 
 
 Another part of their article is, 'big diamond businessmen knew that the business of Mehul and Nirav was going to collapse, but they did not even know that they would do this game with the help of letter of undertaking
 maal kii qeemat zyaada bataanaa, bill main kam dikhaanaa, smagaling kaa maal kareednaa bechnaa, tex chori karnaa yah sab to chalata he magar letters of anderstanding kaa idia kisi ko nahin tha
 Even these diamond traders do not understand how Nirav and Mehul achieved such a letter of undertaking
 ' This incident has brought the diamond trade in doubt
 isaki chamak ke peeche kaa andhera bataa rahaa he ki ham sab kitne bhole hai
 By dazzling, the hoaxers are still collecting all the goods
 is bich quint hindi ke sampadakeey nideshak or varisht patrkaar sanjay pugaliya ne twit kiya he ki 'neerav modi ne apane bacchon kaa mumbai ke skulon se chah maheene pehle hi naam katwa liya tha jab skool satr ke bich main hi the
 The children moved to America with their mother
 kaarobaari parivaar hairaan the ki aisa kyon hua
 Now they know the reason
 ' So there was complete preparation to escape
 
 
 hamaare sahyogi maanas pratap singh ne jaankaree di he ki neerav modi march 2017 tak bhartiya naagarik tha lekin november 2017 se wo enarai he or usne apana pataa dubai main burj caliph kaa diya he
 Where is Mehul Chowki, why have not he been caught, the rest of the people are being questioned, no arrests have been made
 bank ke karmchaaree to turant giraftaar ho gaye hai
 Law Minister, Human Resource Minister, Defense Minister and Agriculture Welfare Minister are going to press conference on this
 pataa chalaa ki sara mantrimandal press conference kar gaya magar neerav or mehul nahin aae
 Meanwhile, Central Vigilance Commission i
e
 CVC called Punjab National Bank officials for questioning
 
 
 khaas baat ye he ki isi sivisi ne beete teen saal main teen baar banking main satarkta baratane ke liye punjab neshnal bank ko aword diye hai
 Two of these awards were given to Punjab National Bank last year, the year in which PNB issued 293 lous to Nirav Modi and his family
 is sivisi se hi poocha janaa chahie ki wo satarkta puraskaar kaise detaa he
 What is its process of awarding
 is ghatana se satarkta ayog kii chhavi ko kitna dhakka pahunchaa he, basharte is dhakke se kisi ko fark padataa ho
 Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary presented the awards with his own hands
 ab vahi unase puch rahe hai ki gadabadi kyon or kaise ho gai
 They should themselves come out in front of the public and tell their views
 kaarobaari vikram kothaari kii company rotomac kii banaai kalam kareed kar ham log sach likhte hai magar company vaale vikram kothaari 3695 karod nahin chukaa paa rahe hai
 He took loans from Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India
 in bainkon ne niyamon ko taak par rakhkar vikram kothaari ko lone diya
 But now Kothari is neither paying interest nor origin
 farvari 2017 main lone chukaane main naakaam rahane par bainkon ne unhen vilphul difolter ghoshit kiya yani jo jaanboojhkar lone chukaane main asamarthta jataae
 After this, banks started the auction of various properties of Kothari and his family members last year to recover some of their dues
 kanpur ke maal road ke city centre main rotomac company ke ofis par kai dinon se taala band he
 Following the complaint of the Bank of Baroda, the CBI has filed an FIR against him and raided his three locations in Kanpur
 vikram kothaari, unki patni or bete se sibiai ke afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Earlier it was said that Vikram Kothari has also fled abroad but he was seen at a wedding ceremony in Kanpur on Sunday night
 gaban ko lekar sawaalon ke jawaab main kothaari ne kaha ki 'main desh chhodkar bhaag nahin rahaa hum
 i am from Kanpur and will live here
 bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 i was aghast after hearing from his mouth
 lone lekar gaban karne main bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he yaa vaaki bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 Actually everyone knows that it is nothing to be
 aise hi jaanch vaanch hoti rahegi baad main sab rafa dfa
 On the question of not repaying the loan, Kothari said that 'I have taken a loan from the bank, but it is wrong to not repay the loan
 meraa or bank kaa neshnal company lau tribunel ke andar cese chal rahaa he
 On the other hand, Kothari's lawyer says that if a bank does not repay the loan, it should not be called fraud, it is not a crime
 ek janaa pahachaanaa paan masala brands paan paraag vikram kothaari parivaar kaa hi he
 The Nirav Modi episode after the Pakoda episode has awakened people's imagination
 wo modi ko lekar tarah-tarah kaa jogira sara raara likh rahe hai

 These banks gave loans to Vikram Kothari by following the rules
 lekin ab kothaari na to byaaj chukaa rahe hai naa mul
 Failing to repay the loan in February 2017, the banks declared him a willful defaulter, which was a deliberate inability to repay the loan

 CBI officials are questioning Vikram Kothari, his wife and son

 In response to questions about embezzlement, Kothari said that "I am not running away from the country
" kanpur kaa rahanevaala hum or yaheen rahoonga
 There is no better country than India
 unke mukh mandal se sunakar main saham gaya
 There is no better country than India in taking a loan or is there a better country than India

 Such investigation will continue to happen later all the time

 The case is going on inside the National Company Law Tribunal of mine and the bank

 The creation scam was also a banking scam
 2013 main hi bhartiya reserve bank ne likhaa tha ki srijan ke khate kii jaanch ho magar jaanch nahin hui, ghotaalaa chalata rahaa
 Now when the scam came to light, the case went to the CBI

 This is such a scam, if it was investigated quickly, then other states would also be affected, but everything is growing like slow news

 If CBI could not arrest the main accused in 6 months then what to say, while CBI has so far filed 5 charge sheets, 2 supplementary charge sheets

 After two to three days when the focus of the media will change, the creation of the Punjab National Bank scam will also be similar to the creation scam

 Meanwhile, Central Vigilance Commission i

 CVC called Punjab National Bank officials for questioning
 
 
 khaas baat ye he ki isi sivisi ne beete teen saal main teen baar banking main satarkta baratane ke liye punjab neshnal bank ko aword diye hai
 Two of these awards were given to Punjab National Bank last year, the year in which PNB issued 293 lous to Nirav Modi and his family
 is sivisi se hi poocha janaa chahie ki wo satarkta puraskaar kaise detaa he
 What is its process of awarding
 is ghatana se satarkta ayog kii chhavi ko kitna dhakka pahunchaa he, basharte is dhakke se kisi ko fark padataa ho
 Central Vigilance Commissioner KV Chaudhary presented the awards with his own hands
 ab vahi unase puch rahe hai ki gadabadi kyon or kaise ho gai
 They should themselves come out in front of the public and tell their views
 kaarobaari vikram kothaari kii company rotomac kii banaai kalam kareed kar ham log sach likhte hai magar company vaale vikram kothaari 3695 karod nahin chukaa paa rahe hai
 He took loans from Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India
 in bainkon ne niyamon ko taak par rakhkar vikram kothaari ko lone diya
 But now Kothari is neither paying interest nor origin

 After this, banks started the auction of various properties of Kothari and his family members last year to recover some of their dues

 Following the complaint of the Bank of Baroda, the CBI has filed an FIR against him and raided his three locations in Kanpur
 vikram kothaari, unki patni or bete se sibiai ke afasar poochtacha kar rahe hai
 Earlier it was said that Vikram Kothari has also fled abroad but he was seen at a wedding ceremony in Kanpur on Sunday night
 gaban ko lekar sawaalon ke jawaab main kothaari ne kaha ki 'main desh chhodkar bhaag nahin rahaa hum
 i am from Kanpur and will live here
 bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 i was aghast after hearing from his mouth
 lone lekar gaban karne main bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he yaa vaaki bharat se behatar koi desh nahin he
 Actually everyone knows that it is nothing to be
 aise hi jaanch vaanch hoti rahegi baad main sab rafa dfa
 On the question of not repaying the loan, Kothari said that 'I have taken a loan from the bank, but it is wrong to not repay the loan
 meraa or bank kaa neshnal company lau tribunel ke andar cese chal rahaa he
 On the other hand, Kothari's lawyer says that if a bank does not repay the loan, it should not be called fraud, it is not a crime

 a similar creation scandal came to light in Bihar in August last year

 In 2013 itself, the Reserve Bank of India wrote that the creation account should be investigated but not investigated, the scam continued
 ab jab ghotaalaa saamne aayaa to maamla sibiai ke paas gaya
 The CBI has been investigating for 6 months but the main accused in the creation scam have not even been arrested
 tippaniyan Our colleague Manish Kumar has filed a report that so far the main accused in the creation scam are Priya and Amit absconding
 sibiai ne abhi tak giraftaar ke liye warrant tak nahin liya he
 This is the speed of CBI regarding this 1500 crore scam
 sarkaar kii yojanaayen jab bhagalpur pahunchati thim to ziladhikari check kaat kar bhagalpur ke bank of baroda kii shakha ko dete the ki paisa srijan naam kii sanstha ke khate main jamaa kara diya jaae
 Money used to flow from there and was distributed among the people

 The government has changed in Bihar and the creation scandal has slowed down
 6 maheene main sibiai mukhya abhiyukt ko giraftaar na kar sake to kya kaha jaae jabaki sibiai abhi tak 5 chargeshit, 2 supplementry chargeshit daayar kar chuki he
 Right now the investigation is taking place
 do teen dinon baad jab media kaa focus badalegaa to punjab neshnal bank ke ghotaale kaa haal bhi srijan ghotaale ke jaisaa ho jayega
 In a poor state like Bihar, if someone takes 1500 crores of loot, and no matter what, then God is the owner of the poor

 Lieutenant Aparna Nair was born in Thalassery in Kannur district, Kerala
 unhone dilli ke holi child senior secondary skool main shiksha hasil kar jaipur se iti main bi tech kiya
 In December 2012, he joined the Indian Navy and after completing training, the appointment was made in Delhi itself
 unhone NDTV se baatcheet main bataaya, 'pita acountint hai or maa usee skool main teacher thim jisamen maine shiksha hasil kii he
 My brother is doing b
tech from Sonepat
 ' Lt
 Aparna Nair says, 'I used to always see my cousin, who is a colonel in the army
 unako dekhakar mere man main fouj main jane kii khwaahish jaagi
 My parents dreamed that i would join the army and it was my duty to fulfill their dream
 ' While getting emotional in the name of education for children with disabilities, Aparna says, "on the occasion of Navy Day, the Navy conducts a program on December 4, which was to go to school and tell how good a career in the Indian Navy is
 is kaarykram ke dauraan skool main meri mulaaqaat hui un disable bacchon se hui jo padhanaa chaahate the
 i was surprised that in addition to the teacher in school, the older children there used to help in reading
 un logon kaa maananaa tha ki bachche bachche hai, unako shiksha se dur nahin rakhaa janaa chahie, shiksha sabko milani chahie, wo chaahe gaanvon se hon yaa shahar se
 If they reach the school frame for education, then they must get admission in the school for education
 ek bhi baccha shiksha se chhot gaya to samajhiye desh tarakkee se ruk gaya
 Comments mahilaon ko sandesh dete hue leftinent aparnaa nair kahati hai, 'mahilaon ko ye nahin sochna chahie ki fuj nahin jwine kerani chahie, ye hichak chhod kar army, navy, airforce ko kariyar ke rup main lenaa chahie
 Not only us, family, relatives and visitors feel proud that we have joined the army to serve our country, nothing could be more important in life
 ' Lieutenant Aparna Nair is interested in sketching and music, besides dance
 unka kahana he ki profeshnal or personal life ko bilkul alag rakhana chahie
 'when i stay in my uniform, i am an officer
 us vakt bilkul mahasoos nahin hota ki main mahila hum yaa purush
 And in personal life, i am a little girl for my father and mother
 leftinent aparnaa nair kahati hai, 'main apane chachere bade bhai ko, jo army main karnal hai, ko hameshaa dekha karti thi
 Seeing them, i wished to go into the army
 mere maa-baap kaa sapana tha ki main fuj jwine karun or unka sapana puraa karnaa meraa farz tha jo maine puraa kiya
 ' divyang bacchon ko shiksha ke naam par bhavuk hote hue aparnaa kahati hai, '4 disambar ko navy de ke maukey par nausena kaarykram karwaati he jisamen skool main jaakar ye bataanaa tha ki bhartiya nausena main kariyar kitna acha he
 During this program, i met school children with disabilities who wanted to study
 mujhe hairat hui ki skool main un bacchon ko teacher ke alaava vahaan ke bade bachche padhane main madad karte the
 They believed that children are children, they should not be kept away from education, education should be given to all, whether from villages or cities
 agar wo shiksha ke liye skool ke choukhat tak pahunch jaaen to usko skool main shiksha ke liye pravesh zarur milanaa chahie
 If even one child missed education, then understand that the country stopped progressing
 'tippaniyan Giving a message to the women, Lt Aparna Nair says, "women should not think that they should not join the army, they should leave it hesitant and take Army, Navy, Air Force as a career
" hamen hi nahin, parivaar, rishtedaaron or milane waalon ko garv mahasoos hota he ki ham apane desh kii seva karne ke liye fouj main shaamil hue hai, jindagi main isse badi koi baat nahin ho sakati
 ' leftinent aparnaa nair kii dilchaspee dance ke alaava, scaching or sangeet main he
 He says that professional and personal life should be kept completely separate
 'jab main apni vardi main rahati hum to main ek afasar rahati hum
 At that time, i do not feel at all whether i am female or male

 kamedian ke kambek ko darshak pasand kar rahe hai
 The officials of the Kamal Nath government of Madhya Pradesh have given a very strange statement about electricity
 unhone bijli kii katautee ke liye chamagaadadon ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 At the same time, we have tried to get rid of our responsibility
 aapako bataa den ki bheeshan garmi main madhya pradesh ke logon ko bijli kii katautee se jujhna pad rahaa he
 Constant questions are being raised about the Kamal Nath government
 isse pehle kamalnath sarkaar ne bijli kii katautee ke liye shivaraj sarkaar main kharide gaye kharaab transfarmaron ko jimmedaar bataaya gaya tha
 Now Kamal Nath government officials are blaming bats hanging in the trees for power cuts to hide their failure
 bijli sankat se pareshaan hokar jab urja mantri priyavrat singh ne bijli vibhaag ke adhikariyon kii baithak bulaai, to bijli vibhaag ke afasaron ne bataaya ki chamagadad bijli ke taron par ulta latakate he, jisaki vajah se bijli ke taar aapas main chipak jate he or folt ho jate hai
 This statement of the officials is not embracing the common people and neither does the minister of his ministry Priyabrat Singh
 ajtak se baatcheet main urja mantri priyavrat singh ne kaha, 'jab bijli vibhaag ke afasaron ne baithak main bataaya ki puraane bhopal main chamagadad badi sankhya main rahete hai, jinase bijli ke taron main kai baar folt aa jate hai
 As energy minister, he asked the officials to consider installing ultrasonic devices to keep the bats away from the electrical wires, but before that reduce the load on the transformer
 saath hi taron ko insulate karen
 He also said that i did not believe what the officials said in the meeting called on the power problem
 aapako bataa den ki kamalnath se pehle pichley 15 saal se madhya pradesh main bhartiya janata party kii sarkaar thi
 During this time, such a serious power problem was not seen
 aise main congress kii kamalnath sarkaar main achaanak bijli sankat badhane kii vajah se adhikari is samasya ke peeche kii asli vajah kaa pataa nahin laga paa rahe he or nae-nae tark dekar bachane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 At the same time, in a conversation with Aaj Tak, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan said, 'earlier the Congress government was saying that Shivraj Singh Chauhan bought cheap transformers and now it is saying that electricity is being cut due to bats
 inkaa maansik santulan bighad gaya he
 'let me tell you that the undeclared power cut has become a headache for Kamal Nath government
 abhi ke halaat siyasat ke us daur ko yaad dilaate he, jab 2003 main congress kii sarkaar thi or bijli ek bada mudda banakar congress sarkaar ko aise ukhaad phenkaa tha ki 15 saal tak congress satta main nahin aa pai or ab congress ke phir se satta main aate hi bijli kii samasya paidaa ho gai he
 This dialogue of the film wall starts echoing in honor of the mother whenever the matter arises
 "mere paas maa he
 "but the reality, until now, has been completely different
 mahaj kuch hisson ko chhod den to desh main zyaadaatar pitru-satta vaala samaaj he

 The lawyer said that its details are in the passport manual, which is a classified document

 manmohan singh kii sarkaar main 77 fisadi mantri karodpati hai
 It is worth noting that the minister is not just a millionaire, but his property has registered an increase of more than 1000 percent within two years
 mantriyon kii sampattiyon par aankh khol dene vaali report guuruuvaar ko hi jari hui he
 The public is unhappy with inflation and corruption, but Manmohan's ministers are rich
 sarkaar ke aadhe se zyada mantri naa sirf karodpati hai, balki do saal main kaiyon kii sampatti 100 guna se bhi zyada bad gayi he
 Recently, the Union Ministers made public the details of their support in the PMO
 un aankadon kaa jab associesan for democratic riform or ellection neshnal watch ne vishleshan kiya to chaunkaane vaale nattejey saamne aae
 According to ADR and NEW, the wealth of Dr
 Jagathrakshakan, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting, DMK, has increased by 1092% in 2 years
 2009 main jagatrakshakan kii sampatti kareeb 6 karod thi, jo ab badhkar 70 karod se zyada ho gai he
 That is, his assets have increased by more than 64 crores in two years
 itnaa zyada ijapha to kendriya mantriyon main sabase amir prafull patel kii sampatti main bhi nahin hua
 In 2009, Praful Patel said his assets were more than 78 crores 82 lakhs, which has increased to more than 1 billion 22 crores in 2011
 patel kii sampatti main kareeb 42 karod kaa ijapha hua he
 Kamal Nath is third among the rich ministers
 jinaki sampatti do saal main 189 fisadi badi he
 In 2009, Kamal Nath had declared assets worth Rs 14 crore 17 lakh, Rs 70 thousand 37, in 2011 he has given 26 crore more than this
 dhani mantripoon main doorsanchaar mantri kapil sibbal bhi peeche nahin hai
 His assets are more than 38 crores
 haalanki, 2009 main bhi unke paas 30 karod se zyada kii sapantti thi
 According to ADR and NEW, the assets of many more ministers of the Manmohan government have increased drastically
 kapadaa rajya mantri panaabaka lakshmi kii sampatti do saal main 828 fisadi badi he
 Their wealth has increased from about twenty five million to over 16 crore
 janajaatiy kaary rajyamantri tusharabhai choudhary kii sampatti main bhi kareeb 705 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 The wealth of Vayalar Ravi has also increased by 502 per cent
 sansadeey kaary rajya mantri rajeev shukla 2009 main kareeb 8 karod ke maalik the, ab unki sampatti 30 karod se upar pahunch gai he
 That is 294 percent increase
 ashvini kumaar kii sampatti kareeb saadhe aath karod se badhkar 25 karod se upar chali gai he
 That means an increase of 193 percent
 jayanti natarajan bhi peeche nahin hai
 He now has assets of more than 23 crore, which is 191 percent more than in 2009
 kendriya kanoon salmaan khurshid dhai karod se sava chah karod kii sampatti ke swami ban chuke hai

 Jyotiraditya's wealth has increased by 119 per cent in two years
 susheel kumaar scindia ne is baar apni sampatti 17 karod 80 lakh se zyada bataai he

 pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii sapantti main bhi 16 fisadi ijapha hua he

 2009 main mantriyon kii ausat sampatti 7
 3 crores
 ye badhkar 10
 6 crores
 yani mantriyon kii sampatti main ausatan 3
 There was an increase of 3 crores
 do saal main mantriyon kii sampatti main 45 fisadi kaa ijapha
 Of course these figures do not match the image of the government of the common man
 ek taraf desh ke zyaadaatar vetanbhogi pichley do saal se mandi or mahangaai kii maar se pareshaan hai, duusari taraf karodpati mantri
 Is this the reason that the government is unable to understand the pain of the common man
 jin mantriyon kii sampatti main ai giravatjahaan manmohan mantrimandal ke 24 mantriyon kii sampatti do saal main sau fisadi se zyada bad gai, 15 mantri aise bhi hai jinaki sampatti main giravat darj hui he
 At least that is what they have shown in the PMO, which means
 in mantriyon kii fehrist main shaamil hai kendriya grahamantri pi chidambaram, videsh mantri esaem krishna, farrukh abdulla, virappa moili or jaipal reddy jaise dhakad mantri
 Free ministers have reported a decrease in their wealth compared to 2009
 isamen sabase upar hai pranit cor
 Praneet Kaur had disclosed assets worth 42 crores in 2009, but this time she made public the details of assets worth only 1 crore 89 lakh
 is lihaaj se pranit cor kii sampatti do saal main 96 fisadi ghati he
 Veerappa Moily's wealth has also declined by 95 per cent
 2009 main moili 2 karod 93 lakh ke maalik the
 According to Moily, he now has assets worth only 13 lakh 33 thousand
 farrukh abdulla kii sampatti main bhi 93 fisadi tak kii giravat ai he

 yun to grahamantri pi chidambaram abhi bhi kareeb 25 karod kii sampatti ke maalik hai, lekin 2009 kii tulana main unki sampatti bhi 11 fisadi ghati he
 The assets of Agatha Sangma, the youth minister of the Manmohan government, have come down from 66 lakh to 62 lakh
 isi tarah jitin prasad kii sampatti sava teen karod se ghatakar ab kareeb dedh karod rah gai he
 The data for the difference in assets of ministers compared to 2009 has been released by the Association for Democratic Reforms and the National Election Watch
 india today or exis maai india ke exit pole ne gujarat main bijepi kii spasht jeet kaa anumaan lagaaya he
 The BJP may get 99 to 113 seats, while the Congress may face a major setback on the hopes of returning after 22 years
 congress ko 68 se 82 siten hi mil sakati hai
 Congress seats include Hardik Patel's Patidar agitation organization, Jignesh Mevani and the Bharatiya Tribal Party
 anya ke khate main ek se chaar siten aa sakati hai
 a majority of Gujarat requires 92 seats
 agsit pole main BJP kii laharaham aapako ye spasht kar dete hai ki exit pols nattejey nahin hai, sirf ek anumaan he
 The results will come on 18 December
 exit pols sirf gujarat ke chunavi mood ke bare main kuch sanket dete hai
 Exactly, Gujarat can be said only after looking at the results on 18 December
 lekin india-today or exis maai india ne apane exit pole se jo anumaan lagaaya he uske mutabik bijepi ko gujarat main 47 fisadi vot mil saktaa he
 With 5 per cent of the vote, the Congress can lag behind the BJP
 congress ko 42 fisadi vot milane kaa anumaan he
 Others can get 11 percent votes
 2012 ke chunaav main congress ko 39 fisadi vot mili the, yani congress ke liye yahaan se sirf 3 fisadi vot badha paane kaa anumaan he
 The BJP received 48 per cent of the votes in 2012, leading to a loss of one per cent for the BJP
 aisa lagata he ek tarah se gujarat main 22 saal kii satta ke baad naaraazgi ko bijepi ne apane khilaaf nahin jane diya he or congress ise apane paksh main laane main naakaam dikh rahi he
 Exit Poll: bjp's strategy of sixrahul in Gujarat fails again? Estimates from all exit polls are saying that it is difficult to defeat BJP in Gujarat
 bhale hi congress or rahul gandhi ne puraa jor laga liya
 With the support of young leaders like Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani, the Congress tried its best to turn the anger in its favor
 bhale hi gujarat main satta virdohi maahaul kii baat kahi ja rahi thi
 But at least from the exit polls, it seems that in front of Narendra Modi's name, it seems that Gujarat forgets everyone
 ham aapako jaldi jaldi sabhi exit pols ke anumaan bataa dete hai
 Actually, in the last 16 days of campaigning in Gujarat, the way Narendra Modi took the BJP front
 kya exit pols ke aae nattejey ye sanket de rahe hai ki gujarat main brands modi ne hi baazi palat di, jisko rahul gandhi apane aakraamak campan se chunauti de rahe the
 But in Gujarat it is impossible to brand Modi
 yahaan hona tha nuksaan
 
 
 But the opposition could not dominate 1
 saurashtra-kuccha ke ilaake main naaraazgi ko bijepi ne chunavi nuksaan banane nahin diya
 2
 dakshin gujarat main vyapaariyon kii naaraazgi ko congress apane paksh main nahin kar saki
 3
 jatigat sameekaran saadhane kii koshish bhi congress kii fail hoti dikh rahi he
 4
 patidaaron ko bade paimaane par congress ke saath laane main hardik patel fail dikh rahe hai
 5
 obisi netaa alpesh thakor, dalit netaa jignesh mewaani bhi fail dikh rahe hai
 6
 uttar or madhya gujarat ke ilaake main modi ke aakraamak campan se puri tasviir badal di
 7
 manishankar ayyar ke neech vaale bayaan ko modi ne congress ke liye nuksaan vaala bana diya
 EXIT POLL: Modi magic in Gujarat elections, see figures in pictures PM Modi's strength may not be important for anyone else, may not be necessary for Congress or Rahul Gandhi

 (input bhashaa se bhi) With the backing of Narendra Modi and the Sangh, Manohar Lal Khattar has become the first BJP Chief Minister of Haryana
 isse pehle na kabhi vah vidhayak rahe, na mantri
 That is, like the early Modi, he too has experience of running the organization, not running the government
 aise main manohar laal khatter ke saamne hongi ye 6 chunautiyaan

 manohar laal khatter pakistan se palaayan kar ai punjabi community ke hai
 He has to become the leader of the entire Haryana
 yani ki jat, bishnoi, dalit, ahir, gurjar, brahman, baniyaa, in sabhi jatiyon ko apni chhatari ke neeche lekar aana hoga
 This work is important because caste is still a fact of Indian democracy and elections and in terms of numbers, Khattar's caste is not decisive or effective in Haryana

 The remaining contenders for the post of chief minister will now be in the Khattar cabinet

 Until recently, the biggest criticism of Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the chief minister, has been about discrimination
 hooda ko haryana kaa nahin rohtak kaa siem kaha jaataa tha
 It was alleged that he was only in tune with the development project in the old Rohtak light (rohtak, Sonipat, Jhajjar)
 aise main chaahe dakshini haryana ho yaa jatland kaha jane vaala sirsa, hisar kaa ilaaka
 Everyone kept crying out for their neglect
 khatter kii paidaaish rohtak kii or rihaaish panchakula kii he
 And he is now an MLA from Karnal
 aise main un par kisi kshetra vishesh ko tarjeeh dene kaa dabaav to nahin hi hoga
 Now there is a need to take development to those parts where the wheel has stopped in the last 10 years
 isamen mevaat jaisaa muslim bahul ilaaka bhi shaamil he, jahaan se bijepi kaa ek bhi vidhayak chunakar nahin aayaa

 haryana kii chhavi jat janit he
 You will be surprised to hear, but the people of far-off region feel that in Haryana all are Jats, all do farming, do mastery and drink milk in the morning and evening
 haryana kii nakaaratmak charchaa kabhi khap panchayat ke farmaanon ko lekar hoti he, to kabhi daliton par atyaachaar ko lekar
 Khattar will have to adopt effective mechanisms to prevent caste violence while simultaneously maintaining ethnic, social balance
 iske alaava deron ke bich kii aapasi pratispardhaa se koi tanaav na ho
 This also has to be taken care of
 ek taraf to rajya kii sabase bady aabaadi (lagbhag 23 fisadi) jaaton ko ye nahin laganaa chahie ki hooda gaye, chautaala nahin aae to satta main unki bhagidaari khatm ho gai
 At the same time, non-caste castes should also feel that at least on the basis of caste, they are not being discriminated against in the government machinery

 and one more thing
 punjab ke saath vivaad ko lekar
 Now there is a BJP government in Delhi
 punjab main bijepi ke samarthan se endie ke sahyogi akali dal kii saraparasti vaali sarkaar he
 And there is also a BJP government in Haryana
 jaahir he ki samay aa gaya he jab chandigarh, abohar fazilka jaise rajdhani or seemaa ke vivaad ekbargi sulata hi liye jaaen
 The same thing also applies to the canal water sharing and the Gurudwara Act which came in the last days of Hooda
 aisa mauka siyasat main baar baar nahin aata
 And now BJP or Khattar cannot even do any sort of political manipulation

 Former Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj (sushma Swaraj ”) died on Tuesday night
 vah 67 varsh kii thim
 AIIMS sources said that Swaraj was brought to the hospital at 10
15 pm and was taken straight to the emergency ward
 haalanki unki jaan nahin bachaai ja saki
 After the death of Sushma Swaraj, all the BJP leaders remembered her in their own way
 saath hivipaksh ke netaaon ne bhi unhen shraddhanjali di
 There may have been a lot of differences between Sushma Swaraj and UPA President Sonia Gandhi in political life, but on the demise of Sushma Swaraj (sonia Gandhi), Sonia Gandhi paid her tribute and wrote, 'sushma left when she was still in public life Had to contribute more for the country by staying
 'sushamaa ke pati swaraj kaushal ko likhe patr main sonia ne kaha, ‘main aapaki priy patni ke aakasmik nidhan ke bare main sunakar stabdh or bahut dukhi hum
 'sonia said,' Sushma Swaraj ji was a woman with natural talent
 unhone jo bhi pad sambhala us par rahete hue unhone saahas, patibaddhta, samarpan or yogyata kaa parichay diya
 She was very sociable and had a warm attitude with people from all sections of society
 'unhone kaha, ‘sushamaa ji ek shandaar vaktaa, mahaan saansad thim or unka mithravat swabhaav aisa tha ki sampurna raajnneetik paridrishy main unhen sabakaa sneh or prashansa mili
 We worked as an associate in the Lok Sabha for years and a warm relationship developed between us
 aaj mujhe bahut kshati kaa abhas ho rahaa he
 Sonia said, "she left us at a very young age when she was yet to contribute a lot in public life
" isko dekhte hue unka nidhan or dukhad he
 'he said,' My condolences to you (kaushal) and flute (daughter) in this hour of grief
 ishwar aapako yah kshati bardaasht karne kii shakti de
 'let me tell you that Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed deep sorrow over the demise of former Union Minister Sushma Swaraj, saying that a glorious chapter of Indian politics has come to an end
 modi ne swaraj ke nidhan ko ‘vyaktigat kshati' bataaya
 Modi tweeted, 'india is heartbroken by the demise of an extraordinary leader
 ' unhone kaha ki vah bhul nahin sakate ki kaise purv videsh mantri bina thake kaam karti thim
 Chardham Yatra has started in Uttarakhand, but the state's Tourism and Religion and Culture Minister Satpal Maharaj is keeping a distance from this journey
 baba kedarnath or badrinaath dham ke kapaat khulne ke vakt satpal maharaj kaa vahaan nahin janaa saaf taur par sarkaar se unki naaraazgi kii ore ishaara kar rahaa he
 When he was asked about the absence of any minister when Baba Kedarnath opened its doors, he did not delay in stating that all were present there in a subtle form, even though the body was somewhere else but the mind was there
 Was in the abode of Kedarnath
 yah baat unhone hansate hue kahi
 Let me tell you that Satpal Maharaj is also the minister of religion and culture apart from tourism, in such a situation, his absence to open Kedarnath and Badrinath cake is enough to directly express his displeasure
 baba ke dham se nadaarad rahi sarkaar, nahin pahunchaa ek mantri bhigauratlab he ki is baar 29 april ko baba kedarnath dham ke kapaat khulne the jisamen desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa aana tay mana ja rahaa tha
 Along with him, the Chief Ministers of 19 states were also supposed to arrive at the occasion of opening of the doors but at the last moment there was a change in the Prime Minister's visit and then neither Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat was present in Kedarnath during the opening of the doors nor BJP ruled
 Any Chief Minister of the state
 itnaa hi nahin uttarakhand sarkaar kaa bhi koi mantri is maukey par nahin pahunchaa, aise main sirfpradesh ke governorake
 k Paul and former Chief Minister of the state Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank were the ones who were present on the auspicious time like the opening of Kedarnath's doors
 haalanki kaaphi kirakiri hone ke baad 30 april ko badrinaath dham ke kapaat khulne ke dauraan bhaajapa pradesh adhyaksh ajay bhatta or ucch shiksha mantri dhan singh ravat ne badrinaath ke vidhayak ke saath apni upasthiti darj karwaai
 The Prime Minister is not happy with the speed of work done in Kedarnath? According to reliable sources, the most important reason behind the cancellation of Prime Minister's visit to Kedarnath is the non-completion of the work being done in Kedardham
 kedarpuri kaa sapana puraa karne ke liye khud pradhanmantri narendra modi va piemo lagaataar nazren banaae hue the, magar kapaat khulne se pehle hui video conferencing se kedarnath kaa jayja lene ke baad wo santusht nahin dikhe
 Perhaps this is the reason why the video provided by the office of the Chief Secretary had neither voice nor complete video of any kind
 sirf 11 second ke video ko drone camere se dekhakar hi pradhanmantri asantusht the
 Significantly, the speed with which the instructions were given to work did not work at that speed and still the work is completely incomplete, due to which the passengers are suffering

 What was it then, Prema told her future husband about this

 Of course, such surgeries or things which were once a taboo in Indian society, are emerging as a new trend today
 ab aisi ladakiyon yaa vivaahit mahilaon kii sankhya bad rahi he jo jananaangon ko surgery ke jariye apane mutabik dhaalane ko tavajjo de rahi hai

 kapur kehete hai, ''samaaj main khulepan ke kaaran sex ko lekar najariya badla he
 The number of sexually active youth has increased
 isi vajah se mahilaayein himanoplasty, veginoplasty yaa vegina titaning or lebiaplasty jaisi surgery kii ore rukh kar rahi hai
 Confirming the rapid increase in this surgery, Dr
 Dr Senior Consultant in the Department of Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi
 anup dheer ke is kathan se ho jaati he ki ''ek maah main himanoplasty se judi takreeban 15-20 inquayri aati hai
 Although a doctor says that he used to do one or two hymenoplasties in the first month, now he performs four to five surgeries in a month
 dow
 Says Dhir, "once upon a time, many parents from the Middle East country used to bring their parents for hymenoplasty
 lekin ab to desh ke vibhinn hisson se ladkiyaan aati hai
 "simply put, if a modern Indian woman with self-reliant and cosmetic measures is paid to plastic surgeons across the country at a hefty fee and about 45 minutes of surgery, her hymen (virginity membrane) is broken due to sexual relations
 Showing no hesitation to get it
 is tarah kii surgery karwaane vaali mahilaayein bhi ek jaisi nahin hai
 These include sexually active girls who have undergone hymenoplasty and vagina titanings, middle-aged women looking for sexuality, victims of some form of sexual assault, sex workers and girls living in conservative societies
 himanoplasty, veginoplasty or lebiaplasty surgery kii baat karte samay mahilaon kii umr kaaphi myne rakhti he
 As far as hymenoplasty is concerned, it is choosing girls (19–28 years old) who are sexually active and who want to be daughters-in-law of a conservative family or who do not want to live with any kind of skepticism after marriage
 vegina titaning aisi vivaahit mahilaayein (28-40 varsh) karaati hai jinhone do-teen delivery kii hai yaa jo pati ke saath apane yon sambandhon main pehle-sa sukh paane kii kaamana rakhti hai
 And as far as labiaplasty is concerned, it is done by women of a slightly older age i

 35-50 years and players are also included in it

 "it is often seen that either girls come alone or with a friend for hymenoplasty," says Kapoor
 lekin veginoplasty karaane waalon main aisi mahilaon kii sankhya adhik he, jinke pati bhi saath aate hai
 "hypnoplasty is undoubtedly seen to be associated with social stereotypes, while vaginoplasty with increasing enjoyment in marital life
 ''tabhi to gudgaanv kii ananyaa (badla hua naam) ne apni pandrahavin saalagirah par pati ko sarprise dene ke liye isi surgery ko chunaa
 Ananya said that she was 38 years old and had no sexual relationship with her husband
 unhone apni ek saheli kii salaah par ise chunaa
 According to doctors, due to fractures of virginity membranes or in many cases, the size of the vagina is responsible for reasons other than sexual relations
 dow
 Kapoor relates such a case, "sukhwinder (name changed), who lives in London, came to India to marry a boy of his parents' choice
 use lagata tha ki tampon kaa prayog karne se uski vegina kaa aakaar bad gaya he or vah apane hone vaale pati ko yah sab baat nahin samajha sakati
 He might not even understand
 isliye usne himanoplasty karai
 "anyway, the circumstances of those who undergo hymenoplasty are not the same

 He had sex with his fiancée but she died in an accident
 is dar se ki kahin uske bhavi pati ke saamne yah raaj na khul jaae, usne himanoplasty karwaai
 In this regard, Associate Professor in Sociology Department of Delhi University, Dr
 anuja agarwal kahati hai, ''shauk ke liye surgery karaane vaali ladakiyon kii sankhya kam hi hogi
 Most of the cases will be due to social and physical problems
 ''beshak is tarah kii surgery bhartiya samaaj ke liye ekadam nai hai
 In such a situation, the question of their right and wrong also arises, but Sandhya Moolchandani, author of Kamasutra for Woman, considers this trend to be someone's personal preference
 unka kahana he, ''samaaj teji se badal rahaa he
 Everyone is under pressure to achieve perfection
 aise main agar koi ladki yaa aurat is tarah kii surgery ko apanaati he, to yah uski apni pasand he
 "though Moolchandani believes that physical pleasure has become paramount today, but also questions whether Hymenoplasty is not to lie to ourselves? On the other hand, Dr
 agarwal ise medical enterprise kaa dabaav maanati hai
 She says, "it is the medical enterprise's influence on us and the dominating market that we want to be happy by buying everything
" '' beshak unka kahana sahi ho saktaa he lekin charam anand kii laalasaa aisi cheez he jis par vaivaahik jivan kii dhuree tiki hoti he, isse aatmavishvaas main ijapha or ashankaaye kam hoti hai

 parantu aishwarya ke mad main andhe ho chuke kaundinya ne apni patni kii sahi baat ko bhi galat samajha or anantsutra ko jaadu-mantar vaala vaseekaran karne kaa doraa samajhakar tod diya tathaa use aag main daalkar jala diya
 The result of this heinous act also came to light soon
 unki sari sampatti nasht ho gai
 Being forced to live in a poor and low condition, Kaundinya Rishi decided to atone for his crime
 ve anant bhagwaan se kshamaa maangane hetu van main chale gaye
 What they found on the way, they used to ask for the address of Anantadev
 bahut khojane par bhi kaundinyamuni ko jab anant bhagwaan kaa saakshaatkaar nahin hua, tab ve niraash hokar praan tyaagane ko udyat hue
 Then an old Brahmin came and stopped him from committing suicide and took a cave and made him see the quadrilateral eternal God
 bhagwaan ne muni se kaha-tumne jo anantsutraka tiraskaar kiya he, yah sab usee kaa fal he
 For this atonement, you should observe the eternal fast for fourteen years
 is vrath kaa anushthan puraa ho jane par tumhaari nasht hui sampatti tumhen pun:praapt ho jaaegi or tum purvawat sukhi-samrudh ho jaaoge

 When Javadekar was asked if this time the BJP is going to sit in opposition as per tradition, he claimed to break the myth
 unhone kaha ki pichley kuch varshon se jo yah parampara chali aa rahi he, yah is baar puri tarah khatm ho jaaegi
 On why the power change will not happen this time, Prakash Javadekar replied that after 2014, the country's politics has changed
 bijepi ne lagaataar deshbhar main chunaav jite hai or congress ne haar kaa munh dekha he or vah mahaj 4 rajyon main simatakar rah gai he
 Javadekar said that the poor section which was considered the vote bank of Congress, has now come with Modi ji
 ginaae vasundhara raaje ke kaamkendre main modi sarkaar kii kamyaabi se desh kii raajnneeti main parivartan ke saath hi prakaash jaavdekar ne rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke kaamkaaj kaa bhi jamkar bakhaan kiya

 jabaki 50 lakh mahilaon ko 100 rupee main mobile mili hai
 Up to 50 thousand loans of 28 lakh farmers have been waived
 'jaavdekar ne jab itane kaam ginaae to unase poocha gaya ki itnaa kuch karne ke baavjood janata or kaaryakartaaon main naaraazgi kyon hai
 On this, Prakash Javadekar used the election slogan of SP President Akhilesh Yadav in the 2017 UP Assembly elections
 unhone kaha ki vasundhara ji ne jitna kaam kiya he, uskaa utana prachaar nahin ho paaya he, lekin kaam zyada bolta he
 Javadekar said that those who have benefited from the government's schemes, they are promoting themselves
 bataa den ki akhilesh yadav puure chunaav main apane kaam ko lekar janata ke bich jate rahe, lekin nattejey unke liye kaaphi niraashajanak rahe

 singapore main apshisht jal ke pun: upyog se pani kii aapurti kii jaati he
 After attending the Padma Awards ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan, Kejriwal told reporters that his government had already sent a team to Singapore to study the water supply model
 unhone kaha, 'singapore ke paas apana pani nahin he
 About 95 percent of the water comes from outside
 isse nibatane ke liye singapore ne ek takanic viksit kii he, jisamen istemaal kiya gaya jal saaf kiya jaataa he or phir use dobaaraa istemaal main laayaa jaataa he
 The Chief Minister said, "we are studying how this is done
" ek maheene ke andar dilli main us takanic kaa istemaal karne ke liye payalat pariyojna shuru karne kii hamaari yojana he
 'kejriwal said,' After being filtered, the water quality is like mineral water
 ' mukhyamantri ne kaha ki agar yah takanic dilli main kaam kar saki, to mujhe lagata he ki dilli main pani kii kami nahin hogi
 Talking about other issues in the city, he said that property tax is also an issue and work is being done on it

 'he said that the government would look into the matter
 dilli nagar nigam (emsidi) sahit shahar ke anya muddon ke bare main puche jane par unhone kaha, 'bhartiya janata party ko unka khyal rakhana chahie
 He said, 'we have heard that they are being paid, BJP should take care of them
 ' AAP ke aantarik maamalon par sawaalon ko najrandaaj karte hue kejariwal ne kaha, 'party acha kar rahi he or kahin koi samasya nahin he
 Kejriwal refused to comment on disgruntled party leaders Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan

 Aam Aadmi Party's vote of confidence in the Delhi Assembly passed with the help of Congress mlas
 isi ke saath sarkaar girane ko lekar lagaai ja rahi atakalon or ashankaon par viraam lag gaya
 The 70-seat Delhi Assembly had 37 votes in favor of the trust vote
 inamen 28 vidhayak aam aadmi party ke,7 congress ke, ek vidhayak jediu kaa or ek nirdaleey he
 The opposition bjp's 32 mlas did not support it
 arvind kejariwal ne kya kahaservind kejariwal ne apane bhaashan kii shuruyaat sabko nae saal kii badhai dekar kii
 He then assured the House that action would be taken against corruption
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi party kaa makasad sirf sarkaar banane kaa nahin he
 Rather, there are some public issues on which everyone needs to come together
 aam aadmi kii paribhaasha dete hue kejariwal ne kaha ki is desh kaa har eemaandaar shaks aam he or har beyimaan khaas
 For us slum dwellers are also common and people living in plush houses of Greater Kailash are also common provided they are honest
 vakt aa chukaa he jab sadan is bare main soche ki aam aadmi chahta kya he
 The public has great expectations from us
 desh kii raajnneeti bhrasht ho chuki he
 It is completely damaged
 bijli, pani or shiksha se judi kai samasyaayein hai or iske liye jimmedaar he sirf bhrasht raajnneeti
 The politicians had stopped listening to the common man
 desh kii janata apni maangon ko lekar sadakon par utari to netaaon ne unhen chunaav ladane kii chunauti de di
 But the leaders had forgotten that the common man is the most powerful
 kheti aam aadmi karata he, netaa nahin
 The common man goes into space, even if he is a leader, he showed it by fighting elections
 aam aadmi ne sachai ke raste ladaai ladi or uski jeet hui
 i became convinced that the one who does not have one is the one above
 iske baad baat ai muddon kii
 Kejriwal said that there is a need to end VIP culture from the country
 ye bekaar baat he ki ham netaa hai isliye red lite par chhot milani chahie
 It must be closed
 ek sakht lokayukta kanoon kii jarurat he
 The law should be so strict that one should tremble before committing corruption
 iske liye ek citijan charter banane kii jarurat he
 There should be a set time for completion of every task and those who do not complete the work on time should be punished severely
 dilli kii janata kii choti-choti maangen hai wo bhi puri nahin ho paati hai
 We have to bring complete Swaraj
 aisa swaraj jisamen janata tay kare ki koun se kaam hone hai, na ki netaa va afasar
 Arvind Kejriwal also spoke on the issue of electricity, water and irregular colonies
 kejariwal ne kaha ki maine bijli companiyon ke audit ke aadesh de die hai
 At least it will be known from the investigation that these companies were spending on electricity and how much money they were charging from us
 phir ye sadan milakar tay kar le kii bijli kii daren kya hongi
 The public is upset with the water bill
 hamane unhen raahat dene kii koshish kii he
 Many people do not even get water
 is ore ham kaam karenge
 People live in slums, we have to think about them
 ham yahi chahenge ki unke gharon ko nahin ujaada jaae
 Because for a man, his house is everything, if he snatches too, then there will be a lot of trouble
 jahaan tak baat aniyamit coloniyon kii he to is sadan main maujuud sabhi partiyaan use niyamit karnaa chaahati hai
 On the issue of education, Kejriwal said that the condition of government schools in Delhi is very bad
 sach to ye he ki ham main se kisi kaa baccha sarkari skool main nahin padhata
 There is a need to improve the condition of these schools
 iske alaava sarkari skulon kii sankhya badhaane kii bhi jarurat he
 Private schools have very high fees
 mahila suraksha par kejariwal ne kaha ki yah ek ahm mudda he
 Everyone knows about the Damini scandal, justice was found within five months
 par aise or kai vaardaat hai jisamen peedit ko abhi tak nyaay nahin mila
 Special arrangements will have to be made regarding women safety
 sambandhit maamalon kii sunwaayee ke liye court kii sankhya badhaani hogi
 First courts have to be created so that they do not delay in getting justice
 ham yahaan sarkaar banane nahin aaye
 The question is public issues
 aaj desh ye jaanata chahta he ki koun-koun is desh main sachhee or eemaandaar raajnneeti kaayam karnaa chahta he
 The question is who stands with the common man in this battle of the common man
 manish sisodiya ne rakhaa vishwaas prastaavshiksha or peedblyoody mantri manish sisodiya ne vidhansabha main vishwaas prastaav pesh kiya
 With the motion moved, he appealed to every MLA present in the House that his party should be given a chance to serve the people of Delhi
 hamen sarkaar banane kaa bahumat nahin lekin naitik janadesh mila tha
 But the figure was not complete
 ham janata ke paas raay lene gaye
 The people of Delhi ordered us to form the government
 sarkaar banane ke liye hamane koi samjhauta nahin kiya
 Did not discuss it with anyone
 hamaara makasad saadagi kii raajnneeti ko badhaava dena he
 Our aim is to pass strict Lokpal laws
 sadan main maujuud sabhi mananeey sadasyon se main yah kahana chahta hum ki vah kisi bhi party se hon, dilli kii janata ke paksh main aitihaasik faisla len
 Dr
 harshavardhan: AAP kii majaburi jaananaa chahta he deshdilli ne sabase eemaandaar party ko sabase zyada vot dilaae
 Ironically, the party that had been ruling the house for 15 years was reduced to 8, the party that got the most seats sat in the opposition and the party with 28 seats is in power
 jab arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki vah congress or bijepi se na samarthan lenge, na denge, to unke prati aadar kaa bhav drudh hua tha
 Going a step ahead, he had sworn on a TV channel, etc
 kabhi-kabhi mujhe lagata he ki unka ansaintific mind he, lekin apni baat par kaayam hai
 But breaking the oath reveals a lot of truth
 sabko sweekaar karnaa chahie ki dilli kii janata ne bhrasht congress ke khilaaf janadesh diya tha
 He had said that he would send the former Chief Minister (sheela) to jail and get him investigated against him and other ministers and officials of the government
 lekin kal maine suna ki vah kah rahe hai ki dow
 If Harshavardhan has any proof, then give it
 mere paas jo saboot hai wo to unhone khud kai baar ujagar kiye hai
 The whole country wants to know what compulsion the Aam Aadmi Party has that they took the support of the Congress

 While you also know that the Janlokpal can form the central government
 phir aapane kaha ki janalokayukta logon ko samaj main nahin aata isliye aap ise janalokapal kehane lage
 The Aam Aadmi Party survived the sting operation with the help of Congress

 aapaki party ke ek netaa ne kaha ki jo log kashmir main rahete hai unka janamat-sangrah hona chahie or agar log chaahate hai ki kashmir ko alag kar diya jaae to kar dena chahie or pakistan main mila diya jaae to vah bhi karnaa chahie
 (aam Aadmi Party mlas protested over the factual mistake on the statement, settled the matter with the intervention of the speaker
 harshavardhan aage bole)
 Your leader also raised questions on the martyrdom of Mohanchand Sharma
 aap poochhate rahe ki abhi gathbandhan na karne vaali bijepi kya 2014 main gathbandhan karegi? bhale hi aap congress ke saath gathbandhan karke sarkaar bana len lekin 2014 main narendra modi kii aguwai main agar endie kaa elliance banane kii jarurat padegi to hamen uski bhi ijaajat nahin he
 So far, 3 lakh 69 thousand dollar help from the Ford Foundation was given to your organization 'kabir' (manish Sisodia's NGO)

 You have announced free water, but now when the water bills come, everyone will know who is benefiting so much
 aap sabsidi badhaakar bijli ke daam gata rahe hai
 You would have pressured DERC to reduce prices
 lekin aap meraa hi paisa meri hi jeb se nikaalkar keemat ghataane kaa dikhaava kar rahe hai
 We also talked about reducing the price, but we did not plan to take money out of one pocket and put it in another

 Manish ji was talking about moral majority
 raajnneeti ke kshetra main agar sabase zyada koi aniatik bahumat ho saktaa he to vah aap donon kii mili-juli sarkaar kaa he
 You have compromised with corruption
 kabhi kabhi hamen lagata he ki satta kii vajah se logon kii laar tapakane lagati he
 We do not think that we cannot support such a government which betrays the people and the country
 nahin kar sakate
 Arvinder Singh Lovely: Doctor Saab! The above has given pain, i have stood on behalf of my mlas in support of the same proposal that the medicine Degamish Sisodia has brought
 doctor sahab kaa bada ojasvi bhaashan sunne ko mila
 For the first time in 15 years

 Be patient
 uuparavaale ne jo dard diya he, uski aadat daaliye
 The one who has given pain will give the same medicine
 ham bhi aapaki jagah hote to dard main karaah rahe hote
 But now whatever happens, you will stay here
 main aapako salaah dena chahta hum ki bijepi kii wo vaali seat badi kharaab hai, vahaan jo baithta he yaa to sidhaa out hota he yaa jagadish mukhi vaali seat par jaakar baithta he
 You have the custom of these waiting anyway
 adhyaksh ji, aaj mujhe bada acha laga, bangaroo ji or yediurppa kii party vaale log aaj bhrashtachar kii baat kar rahe hai
 Kejriwal also spoke of MCD corruption with the Delhi government
 aap use kyon bhul jate hai
 What was the situation in Delhi in 1998
 or ab dekhie
 i have not stood up to take any credit or count achievements
 ham janata ke faisle ko sweekaar karte hai
 Today we have supported them because we do not want Delhi to be pushed into another election
 keval isliye ki loktantr kamjor na ho
 We have taken this decision in view of all these things
 kejariwal ji aaj main aapako yah kahana chahta hum
 You also give a 48-hour statement
 main aaj on record aapse vaada kar rahaa hum ki aapaki sarkaar jab tak janhit kaa kaam karti rahegi ham aapako samarthan denge or jarurat padi to paanch saal tak bhi dete rahenge
 The decision you have made on water will not benefit those who need it
 aapke is faisle ke baad dilli main pani sasta hone ke bajaae mahangaa ho gaya he
 If you gave subsidy on electricity, where are you different from us? aapako bhi lagata he ki koi or tarika nahin he
 Sir, i also want to tell you

 Customs held us at the airport for 3 hours

 They did not even know what to write in which column of the register? However, it took us 45 minutes to deal with them

 Now the problem was that there was no SIM card number

 If we calculate, then it is known that the price of Indian hundred rupees here is 200
 in sab main kareeb dhai ghante nikal gaye
 It takes one and a half hours to get from the airport to Colombo, but Sameera said that he will take us from the new highway

 Explosive Chris Gayle blew Aatish with the bat, while Sunil Narayan played the magic of the spin and blasted the batsmen
 westeindies kii team bhale hi england main test shrunkhlaa main jujh rahi ho, lekin uske kai khilaadi indian premier lig kii tiimon main sankatmochak sabit hue hai
 Caribbean players such as Chris Gayle, Sunil Narine, Dwayne Bravo, Dwayne Smith and Kevon Cooper left no stone unturned to make their way to the IPL
 in cricketron ne apni tiimon ko kai maichon main jeet dilaai, lekin yah hairaani kii baat he ki inamen se kisi ko bhi westeindies kii team main jagah nahin mil pai he
 When the West Indies lost their first Test match to England by five wickets at Lord's, cricket lovers on the Indian soil had the names of Caribbean cricketers like Gayle, Sunil Narine and Bravo
 gail apane cricket board ke saath vivaad ke kaaran pichley saal vishwa cap se antarrashtriya cricket main nahin khele hai
 Meanwhile, Gayle showed great vigor in the Twenty20
 unhen ipel main lagaataar duusare saal sarvaadhik ran banane ke liye orange cap milanaa tay he
 Gayle's team Royal Challengers Bangalore may be out of the IPL, but the left-handed batsman's reach of 733 runs does not seem to be on the strength of any other batsman
 gail ne is ipel main 61
 He scored at an average of 08 and hit a record 59 sixes
 duniya ke cricket premi unhen westeindies kii team main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 He may return to the national team for odis, but the lack of Gayle, who has scored two triple centuries in Tests, is hurting the team in the Test series
 keker yadi final main pahunch paaya he, to narayan ne usamen mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa kii he
 He has 11 in 14 matches so far
 95 kii ausat se paanch wicket liye hai
 Not only this, he has so far only 5 per over
 29 ran die hai, jise tii-20 main behtareen aankada mana ja saktaa he
 Narayan could prove to be very effective in England
 unhone ab tak westeindies kii taraf se aath ekadivasiy match khele hai, jisamen 20
 He performed well with 14 wickets at an average of 00
 yahi nahin chah pratham shrenee maichon main 11
 a performance of 34 wickets at an average of 88 suggests that Narayan can also succeed in long-term matches
 gail kii tarah dwen braavo ne bhi disambar, 2010 se test match nahin khele hai
 But his stay out of the West Indies team is proving to be a boon for Chennai
 braavo ne apni jabardast hiting or deth overon main kifayati gendbaaji se kaaphi prabhavit kiya he
 The all-rounder has played all 17 matches for Chennai so far, in which he has scored 338 runs and taken 13 wickets
 braavo ne alimineter match main buudhvaar ko mumbai indians ke khilaaf jis tarah se dhamaakedaar ballebaaji or jaandaar gendbaaji kii, usase sambhavat: carabian chayankartaaon kii aankh khulegi
 It was probably Mumbai's mistake not to field Smith in the opening matches, as he later made a good opening pair with Sachin Tendulkar
 ipel main saat match main 157 ran banane vaale smith pichley chah saal se test or pichley do saal se vanade nahin khel paae hai
 The comments pollard kuch maichon main hi apana jalawaa dikhaa paae
 He scored 220 runs in 14 matches and got only 14 sixes off his bat
 unhone gendbaaji main isaki bharpai karne kii koshish kii
 Pollard 21
 87 kii ausat se 16 wicket liye
 Kevon Cooper played very well in the early matches of Rajasthan Royals
 kupar ne chotil hone se pehle chah match main 90 ran banaae or 10 wicket liye
 Royals captain Rahul Dravid was highly impressed by his performance
 unhone kaha tha ki unki frenchiji ne jo daanv khelaa tha vah sahi tha
 Cooper has not played international matches yet
 andre rasel ne dilli dairedevills kii taraf se keval teen match khele lekin unhone apni power hiting se darshakon ko romanchit kiya
 Malren Samuels also played well in a few matches before joining the national team
 iske baad england ke khilaaf pehle test match main unhone behtareen pari kheli thi

 !! i mean CHRIS GAYLE a fan of Hindi movies and presents me a golden bat autographed !!?? i mean this is revelation Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is going to reshuffle his Council of Ministers in the evening
 isamen kuch nae chehre shaamil kiye jane, kuch ko padonnati milane or kuch ko nikaale jane kii sambhaavnaaen hai
 There are reports of Trinamool Congress chief whip Sudip Bandhopadhyay being inducted as Minister of State in the Lok Sabha and his party colleague and Minister of State for Health Dinesh Trivedi as Cabinet rank minister
 bataaya jaataa he ki unhen rail mantralay saunpa ja saktaa he
 The post of Railway Minister has been vacant since Mamta Banerjee became the Chief Minister of West Bengal
 mantriparishad main pherbadal ko lekar somvaar subah pradhanmantri manmohan singh or samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke bich mulaakaat hui
 This was the fourth meeting between the two in recent times
 chah maheenon main duusari baar hone ja rahe is pherbadal main big four yani vitt, grih, raksha or videsh mantralay main koi badlaav nahin hone kii sambhaavna he

 Most of the men themselves go to the gym or park to exercise, etc
, but are not very cautious about the health of the life partner
 aise log maanate hai ki gharelu kaam karte vakt hi mahilaon kaa acha-khaasaa vyaayaam ho jaataa he, iske baad ve gym na bhi jaaen, to unhen koi nuksaan nahin hoga
 But the reality is different
 adhyayan main yah baat saamne ai heki mahilaayein kasarat aadi na karke purushon ke mukaable apana kaaphi nuksaan karti hai
 Women themselves have an increased risk of developing depression and metabolic syndrome, as they exercise less daily than men
 america main oregaan state uniwarsity ke shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki ek din main ek mahila ko ausatan kasarat ke liye maatr 18 minute kaa samay miltaa he, jabaki purush niyamit rup se ausatan 30 minute kasarat karte hai
 This increases the risk of women becoming victims of metabolic syndrome
 metabolic syndrome ek aisi avasthaa he, jisamen ucch kelesterol, ucch raktchaap, vajan badhanaa, dil kii beemaari or tip tu madhumeh shaamil he
 The Daily Telegraph was quoted by leading researcher Paul Lopiranji as saying

 These people are forced to hide in a small room for one year
 companiyon ke baahar kiya virodh pradarshnain bharatiyon ne kai baar companiyon ke baahar virodh pradarshan bhi kiya, lekin koi phayda nahin hua
 Due to not getting salary for so many days, people started having food cravings

 pehle se behatar halaat vaali rahan-sahan kii dashaon ke saath jananath house main bed or baithne kaa sthaan pehle jitna hi rahegaa
 Hence it has become a cause of concern for the members
 philhal is ghar main sirf 10 sadasyon ke sone ke liye hi jagah he yani sirf 5 dabl bed hai
 So now the game is how the household members will ensure that each participant can sleep comfortably
 It's a result of activities of some people with perverted minds
 This corrupts purity of our land
 This issue corrupts honour of women
 If men will say the same thing about women what will happen? Is it acceptable? This is wrong: Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan # metoo (17

 jsp? lang = 0 & id = 0,4,361 south ke superstar prabhas bahubali siries main kaam karne ke baad se jis tarah logon ke bich popular hue hai uskaa koi sani nahin he
 The girls are already floored on their physical as well as their action is also world crazy
 ab to prabhas bollywood main bhi entry maar rahe hai
 He is preparing to make his Bollywood debut with Saaho
 mana ja rahaa he ki unka bollywood debyue bhi shandaar hoga
 But let us tell you that there is a parallel thing going on that can prove fatal for his career
 bollywood main ek actor ko agar lambey vakt ke liye tikna he to safalataa kaa maapdand ek hi he
 That is, he has to be versatile
 koi bhi kalakaar yahaan sirf romantic, ection yaa phir kamedi kar ke hi zyada samay tak safalataa kii bulandiyaan nahin chhu saktaa
 There comes a time when the audience starts rejecting it
 dev anand, mithun chakravarti, rajesh khanna or govinda jaise kalakaaron ko is list main liya ja saktaa he jo ek hi johnor par kaam karte rah gaye or ek samay ke baad darshak unki filmon ko nakaarne lage
 Currently the same is happening with Shahrukh Khan
 bollywood ke king khan hone ke baad bhi unki filmein us hisaab se chal nahin paa rahi hai
 Is Prabhas also on the same path? It would not be right to say so completely because they are counted among young artists
 unke paas abhi samay he magar pichley 5 saal main agar gaur kiya jaae to prabhas ne bade project kaa hissaa bananaa jari rakhaa he
 Due to this, they have also done less films and together they are continuously doing action films
 haalanki abhi superstar ke paksh main baat ye he ki unki acting ko kaaphi pasand bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 What is Prabhas himself? Prabhas has mentioned this in an old interview
 unhone kaha tha ki ve khud alag tarah kii filmein karnaa chaahate hai
 Since Bahubali, expectations about them have increased significantly in the minds of people
 aise main ab unke upar logon kii ummiido par khara utarane kii badi jimmedaari bhi he
 Also, working in large projects has become their comfort zone from which they want to get out
 maanav sansaadhan mantralay kii ek jaanch report main saamne aayaa he ki hyderabad uniwarsity ke rohit vemula kii maa ne aarakshan kaa faaydaa uthaane ke liye dalit hone kaa daawa kiya tha or report main rohit ko chatravaas se nikaala janaa sahi bataaya gaya he
 According to the English newspaper 'the Indian Express', a one-member judicial commission inquiry report prepared by the Union Ministry of Human Resources, phd scholar Rohit Vemula of Hyderabad Central University (HCU) was himself responsible for his suicide
 bataaya gaya he ki rohit ne chatravaas se nikaale jane kii vajah se aatmahatya nahin kii thi balki iskaa kaaran vyaktigat tha
 Former Allahabad High Court judge AK Rupanwal said in his 41-page report that the removal from Rohit Vemulaco Hostel was the university's 'most logical' decision
 jaanch report ke anusaar 26 varshiya rohit ne bhedbhaav kiye jane ke chalate nahin balki nijee hataasha ke kaaran aatmahatya kii thi
 On 17 January 2016, Rohit Vemula committed suicide following which students and some political parties protested the incident
 28 janvari 2016 komanav sansaadhan mantralayane maamle kii jaanch ke liye ek sadasyeey nyaayik ayog kaa gathan kiya tha

 It has also been quoted by the inquiry committee that Union ministers Bandaru Dattatreya and Smriti Irani had no pressure in the matter
 report main kaha gaya he ki purv kendriya maanav sansaadhan mantri smriti irani or kendriya mantri bandaaru dattatreya ne keval apana daayitv nibhaayaa or hyderabad uniwarsity prashasan par koi dabaav nahin daalaa gaya tha
 Rupanwal submitted his investigation report in August

 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle piem modi ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke garh amethi ko badi saugat di
 PM Modi inaugurated the Ordinance Factory here today
 is factory main kareeb saadhe saat lakh AK-203 rifl banaai jaaengi
 Apart from this, PM Modi laid the foundation stone of 538 projects
 chunaavon se thik pehle piem modi kaa amethi ko ye badi saugat dena ahm he
 Smriti Irani, who contested from this seat in 2014, gave a tough fight to Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 2014 ke chunaav main haarane ke baad bhi ve is kshetra ke logon se judi hui hai or lagaataar yahaan kaa daura karti rahati hai
 The way Smriti Irani has made her identity among the people here, the same speculations are being made that she can once again contest from here
 aise main 2019 kaa chunaav congress adhyaksh ke liye aasaan nahin rahane vaala
 He is sure to face a tough fight with this powerful BJP leader
 piem modi ne aaj amethi main apni raily main kaha ki 2014 main bhale hi chunaav nahin jeet paae lekin yahaan kaa dil hamane jeeta
 Smriti Irani may have lost the election from here, but even after that the focus of the Modi government remained on this seat
 gandhi parivaar ke garh main vikaas kaary karne kaa matlab yahaan ke logon ko apane paale main karnaa he
 However, how much these actions will be converted into votes will only tell the election results
 rahul gandhi rafel ko lekar piem modi par hamalaa bolte hai
 But today PM Modi did not miss the opportunity to surround Rahul Gandhi in Amethi for the safety of the country and the soldiers
 unhone kaha ki yahi log saalon tak rafel vimaanon ke saude par baithe rahe or jab sarkaar jane kii baari ai to usko thande baste main daal diya
 They said our government came and 1
 5 saal ke bheetar-bheetar saude par muhar lagaai or kuch hi maheene main dushman ke hosh udaane ke liye pehla rafel vimaan bharat ke aasmaan main hoga
 PM Modi said that Rafale's first flight will be in our government
 bataa den ki rafel kii pehali delivery sitambar maheene main hogi
 PM Modi said that these people have made our country not only a modern rifle, not only a modern bulletproof jacket, but also for a modern cannon
 ye hamaari hi sarkaar he jisane aadhunik havitzar top kaa sauda kiya or ab to bharat main hi banaai ja rahi he
 The government which was earlier had left no stone unturned to play with the security forces
 lekin kaam shuru hona to dur, teen saal main pehle kii sarkaar ye tay hi nahin kar pai ki amethi kii ordinance factory main kis tarah ke hathiyaar banaae jaaen
 Not only this, where the factory will be built, the land has not been provided for it
 piem modi ne kaha ki AK-203 riflon se aatankiyon or naksaliyon ke saath hone vaali muthbhedon main hamaare sainikon ko nishchit rup se bahut badhat milane vaali he
 He said that the rifle made here will be known as Made in Amethi
 raily main lage rahul gandhi chor ke narecongress adhyaksh rahul gandhi chaukeedaar chor naare lagaakar piem modi par nishaanaa sadhate rahete hai
 But today he was surrounded in his own stronghold
 piem modi amethi main jis vakt raily main logon ko sambodhit kar rahe the, usee dauraan kuch logon ne rahul gandhi chor he ke naare lagaae
 Factory not used Prime Minister Modi said that the work here should have started 8-9 years ago
 korba kii is factory ko aadhunik riflein banane ke liye hi sthapit kiya gaya tha, lekin iskaa puraa istemaal nahin kiya gaya
 He said that till 3 years after the foundation stone, the earlier government could not decide which weapons would be made in it
 building tak nahin banaai gai
 Work should have commenced in 2010, but its building hung until 2013
 building jaise-taise bani bhi to aadhunik riflon ke nirmaan jaisaa koi kaam shuru nahin hua
 The case of molestation of IAS daughter Varnika Kundu in Chandigarh is trending on social media
 fasebuk or tawitor par varnika ko chandigarh kii sherni ke naam se post daali ja rahi hai
 At the same time Vikas Barala is being commented in a tremendous way on BJP leaders and BJP President Subhash Barala

 But on a derogatory statement, Subhash Barla's son questioned why she was late in the night
 Should not be allowed to stay outside till raat main chaaron ore ghoomane kaa kya matlab he?ek channel ke intervyuu main miss kundu ne is baat kaa joardaar jawaab dete hue kaha ki isse apko matlab nahi hona chahie ki main kahaan ja rahi hum kahaan nahi, is baat kaa matlab sirf mujhase or mere parivaar se he
 All you have to know is that if i am going out then i am not safe even if it is 12 o'clock at night or at 4 o'clock
 29 varshiya varnika ne aage kaha ki agar main raat main aise baahar ja rahi hum to meri galati he? kya purushon ko apane upar control nahi hona chahie
 When Varnika shared this on her Facebook account, it became increasingly viral on social media, she told how on the middle of Friday night, 23-year-old Vikas Barla and his friends kidnapped him and tried to lock him in his SUV car
 lekin varnika ne car kii khidki par takkar maari or car ke get ko kholane kii koshish kii
 The police patrol team gave her SOS and a man who had reached her location had also seen Kundu beating the window
 jo gavaah ke rup main thabijepi ne adhyaksh barla ke istife se inkaar kar diya hai jo aalochakon ke anusaar cover-ap ke prayaason ke bare main atakalon ko majboot karata he
 Police have arrested two people but have been charged with molestation
 apharan karne kaa aarope nahi lagaaya gaya bataaden aapako ye ek gaiyr-jamaanti aarope he
 Nevertheless, the accused was out of police custody for a few hours after his arrest
 yadhyapi varnika ne aadmi ke apharan ke iraade ke bare main shikaayat kii to police ne keval ek dhokhadhadi kaa aarope lagaaya he jo saraasar galat he
 The CCTV cameras are missing from the streets from where he was kidnapped, he said raising a big question on the cover-up
 yah ek bahut acchhee tarah se ranneeti kii gai he
 So that scares me that he is back
 lekin agar un logon ne mujhe pakad liya hota to kya hota? pichley do dinon main, kundu aalochana, badanaami or avmaananaa kaa lakshya rahi hadonon kii giraftaareyon ke baad unhone apni galati maani lekin kya ye vaaki galati thi itane lambey samay tak karne vaali thi
 No mistake can be so fast, a mistake cannot take a kilometer
 wo log maafee maang rahe hai, kyonki maine khud ko bachaa liya he usne poocha agar main khud ko nahi bachaa paati to unhone kisase maafee maangani thivarnik ke pita virendra kundu ne kaha is tarah kii vaardaat se mere man main ek bhrun or ek ladki ko insaan ke rup main maarane main koi antar nahin he
 If no country cannot understand a woman like an equal citizen, then what kind of society are we living in? Are we impolite? Kundu also commented on Ramvir Bhatti's comment that he is not good to talk, he is a prehistoric animal from thousands of years ago
