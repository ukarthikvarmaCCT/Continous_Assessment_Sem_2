 After the police stopped the procession, the atmosphere began to deteriorate and hastily prevented the bully, but the procession did not continue with the band
 haalanki police ne apni maujuudagi main baraat ko vadhu ke daravaaje tak pahunchaaya
 According to Jagdish, the father of the bridegroom, who had opposed the procession of Dalits, he had already expected that some of the villagers of the village would oppose them because the Dabangs had told not to bring the procession of any Dalit community to the village

 a new twist in Jodhpur's famous 'love Jihad' case came on Tuesday when the Rajasthan High Court sent the girl to her in-laws after agreeing to accompany her husband
 yuvati ke parivaar kaa aarope tha ki aropiyon ne jabaran yuvati kaa dharm parivartan karaayaa he
 Payal Singhvi alias Arifa has been sent by the Rajasthan High Court to her husband's house
 iske baad court parisar main vishwa hindu parishad ke kaaryakartaaon ne jamkar hangaamaa machaaya
 Payal's husband mistreated Majeed's lawyer Mahesh Bohra
 jiske khilaaf jodhpur main vakil hadtaal par bhi chale gaye
 Due to which the hearing in the case of Asaram and Salman Khan was also postponed till Wednesday
 darasal maamla mangalvaar se saat din pehle kaa he jab paayal urf aarifa kaa 'lav jehad' kaa maamla saamne aayaa tha
 Then the court sent Payal for seven days to Nari Niketan
 mangalvaar ko court main usee maamle main punah sunwaayee thi
 The court had asked Payal whether she wanted to do so on her own wish
 Is there any pressure on him? The girl agreed, after which the court sent her to her in-laws
 haalanki ladki kaa parivaar abhi bhi yahi kah rahaa he ki yuvati par dawaab he jiske chalate usne aisa bayaan diya he
 Seven days ago, the Rajasthan High Court made a strong comment
 Earlier, in this case, the High Court had made strict remarks
 court ne kaha tha ki sirf nikaah karne se dharm parivartan nahin ho saktaa
 Actually, Chirag Singhvi, the brother of a girl named Payal, alleges that his sister has been converted by getting signed on a stamp paper of 10 rupees
 is bare main court ne rajasthan sarkaar se jawaab maanga he ki vah bataae ki dharm parivartan kaa niyam-kanoon kya he?kya he puraa maamlajodhpur main ek hindu ladki ghar se bhagkar musalmaan ban gai
 After this, when the family reached the High Court, it was revealed that after signing a stamp paper of ten rupees, a Hindu girl named Payal Singhvi became Arifa
 parivaar kaa aarope he ki bahala phusalaakar paayal kaa dharm parivartan karaayaa gaya he
 According to Payal's family members, she had remained in the house till 25 October, suddenly she disappeared
 parivaar jab police ke paas pahunchaa to pataa chalaa ki paayal musalmaan ban chuki he or 14 april 2017 ko uskaa nikaah faij modi ke saath ho chukaa he
 Now call it a coincidence or something
 unnav ke dondiakheda main sant shobhan sarkaar kaa khajaane kaa sapana bhale sach na hua, lekin agra main jaganer ke khurpura gaanv main sapane ke aadhaar par nau ladakiyon dwaara kiye gaye daawey ke mutabik 15 feet khudaai ke baad ‘devi kii pratimaa’ nikal ai
 The rough piece of stone found in abundance in this area looks like a dug-out shape of the eye
 munh ke neeche kii akruti ko jeebh bataate hue ise kaali mata kii pratimaa bataate hue puja-archana bhi shuru kar di gai he
 Nine dreaming girls have also finished their 'austerity', although people worshiping them as goddesses are still cheering them on
 darasal 'pratimaa’ milane hi vaali he, iske sanket to ek din pehle hi mil gaye the, jab kareeb 14 feet kii khodai main ek or shila (ise bhairo murti kaha ja rahaa he) milane ke baad pathar kaa ek tukdaa dikhne laga tha tabhi khudaai band kara di gai
 The stone was covered with chunri
 bhairo murti khode gaye gadde main hi rahane di gai
 Even after the worship, no one was allowed to go near him
 in sabase pehle bhi ek shila nikali thi jise devi kii murti bataate hue khanansthal ke paas hi sthapit kar diya gaya tha
 As soon as the excavation of 15 feet was completed at 11 am, the rock started appearing
 iske baad log jayakaare lagane lage
 Pooja recitation continued till late night

 In this RTI reply it was also told that one thousand 142 terrorist incidents were carried out in Jammu and Kashmir in 2012 and 2016, in which 236 security personnel were martyred and 90 civilians were killed
 vahiin is dauraan suraksha balon ne 507 aatankiyon ko encounter main maar giraaya
 As per RTI reply, Pakistan violated 449 bargefire on loc in the year 2016, while in 2015 it did 405
 major general (ritred) jidi bakshi ne kaha ki pakistan bharat ke khilaaf gopneey yuddh lard rahaa he
 Bakshi said, "pakistan may talk of peace, but it does not believe in peace and Jammu and Kashmir is an example of this
 'iske saath hi jidi bakshi ne bataaya ki aajkal nayaa trend shuru ho gaya he
 Whenever the army surrounds the terrorists in an area, the message is sent to the people gathered around the social platform and an attempt is made to disrupt the army's operation
 grih mantralay ye bhi bataaya ki varsh 2012 main 220 aatanki ghatnaon ko anjaam diya gaya, jisamen sena ke 15jawan shahidahue, jabaki 72 aatankiyon ko dher kar diya gaya
 In the year 2013, during the 170 terrorist incidents, 53 security personnel were killed and 15 civilians were killed, while 67 terrorists were killed by the security forces
 kuch chijen bahut khaas hoti hai

 yahaan baat kar rahe hai indian railway ke dedh sau saal puraani train kii, jo ab itihaas ban jaayegi
 The name of this train is Shramik Train, which last ran on 31 October
 matlab, aaj 1 november se shramik train kaa parichaalan band kar diya gaya
 With the change in timetables of the train, the Railways has also taken an important decision to stop this train
 yah train jamalpur se kajraa or jamalpur se sultangaj ke bich mangalvaar tak hi chali
 Malda Division has decided to stop its 150-year running train
 train ke astitv main aane ke peeche bhi ek kahani he
 Actually, Jamalpur has a huge railway factory, which is Asia famous
 yahaan ab dijal ingine kaa nirmaan or marammat kaa kaam hota he
 It was established by the British on 8 February 1862
 bataate hai ki yahaan british shashan main pehle topon kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa tha
 It was an Ordnance Factory
 baad main ise railway ingine ke nirmaan kaarkaana ke rup main angrejon ne hi tabdeel kiya tha
 Since then, trains were run on these two routes to facilitate the workers working in the factory
 dilachasp baat yah he ki isi vajah se in donon trainon kanaam shramik trainpada
 Common passengers could not travel on these trains
 yah sirf rail shramikon ko apane ghar se duty par aane jane ke liye chalaai gai thi
 For this reason, the tickets of both these root insects were not cut
 lekin aamtaur par inamen duusare musafir bhi safar karte the
 These people were found to be in Bettikat only if they were found checking immediately
 haalanki, shramik train band karne kii koi vajah nahin bataai gai he or naa hi is faisle ke khilaaf koi virodh kii aawaaj uthi he
 But due to the closure of this train, problems of railway workers can definitely increase

 Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi launched the budget smartphone Redmi Note 7 last month
 15 janvari ko pehali cell thi
 Xiaomi claims that since then the company has sold 10 lakh Redmi Note 7
 ye sirf china main mil rahaa he or ye aankada baheen kaa he
 In a tweet the company has said that it has sold more than one million in a month in China alone
 bharat main ye smartphone ab tak launch nahin hua he
 However, Manu Jain, India head of Xiaomi released its teaser long back
 isse laga ye bharat main jald hi launch hoga
 But now according to reports, Redmi Note 7 or Note 7 Pro will be launched in India in March
 shaomi ke india head manu jain ne Gadgets 360 se kaha he, ‘ yah shaayad aisa divaais he jiske liye is saal main sabase zyada utsahit hum
 Can't say its name, but it will have a 48 megapixel camera and it will change the entire Indian smartphone industry
 ’manu jain ne kaha he ki kai sarprise plan kiye gaye hai jo shandaar he
 He has also said that he does not say the same for every phone, but this is one of the reasons and that is why the upside down picture has been posted in which the text is also upside down
 manu jain ko yakeen he ki yah game changer divaais hoga
 However, the company is making air on the social media about Redmi Note 7 for a long time and is delaying the launch even more
 yah smartphone Note 7 ho saktaa he yaa Redmi Note 7 Pro
 Interestingly, its price may be less than Redmi Note 6 Pro
 kyonki Redmi Note 7 china main 999 yuan kii shuruaati keemat ke saath miltaa he jise bhartiya rupee main tabdeel karen to ye lagbhag 10,500 rupee hota he
 The conversation between Manu Jain and Gadgets 360 also suggests that Xiaomi will probably launch Redmi Note 7 Pro by not bringing Redmi Note 7 in India
 event march main ho saktaa he or isse pehle Redmi Note 7 Pro china main launch ho saktaa he
 Note 7 Pro will be better than Note 7 in terms of photography, as it is reported to have Sony IMX sensor

 Several modified versions of this song are already available on youtube

 It is sung in Malayalam in North Kerala, which contains Arabic, Urdu, Persian words
 ise khaastaur par shaadi ke maukon, skool main program ke dauraan gaaya jaataa he
 The original writer of this song was searched after the popularity of the original song, written four decades ago, increased
 sabase rochak baat yah he ki kisi malayalam portal ne unka intervyuu kiya
 Jabbar, the writer of the song, now lives in Saudi Arabia and has been working in a general store for the last five years

 Important date: Last date to apply: 31 January Date of written examination: 26 March Date of interview: In the first week of June rahul gandhi kii nai team ke chehre bhavishya main congress ke bheetar banati rahul kii li kii kahani khud kah dete hai
 Meenakshi Natarajan, Harish Chaudhary, Ashok Tanwar, Krishna Veregowda, Rajeev Satav, Shanimol Usman and Jyoti Mirdha like Cheroha mean defining youth and land politics in a new way
 in chehron kii badaulat rahul gandhi congressi raajnneeti ke us bottleneck ko kholana chaahate hai, jo netaaon ke anubhav or umr ke naam par abhi tak congressi raajnneeti ko paaramparik tareeke se hi dhota rahaa or bitate vakt ke saath aam logo se sarokaar khatm hote gayi
 Rahul's view of the new team is triple
 panchayat or blaak str par yuva chehre hi sampark saadhe, dilli se elaan hoti sarkaar kii nitiyo ke asal chehre par report den or tisaracongress ko khuli kitaab kii tarah jamini str par rakhen jisase aam aadmi jude
 That is, the Congress of the future Congress of Rahul Gandhi Mission 2014 also wants to lay the foundation of the new team, and for the first time, the first political APIR about the policies in every field, with the help of a total of 34 secretaries of the Congress, is from its youth team
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki congress main mahasachivo kii qatari ko samoochee bahes or nirnay us report ke aadhaar par hi lene hogen jo yuva team har blaak or panchayat str par ghum ghum kar icttha karegi
 The special thing is that Rahul's new team is also preparing to infiltrate the vote-backs of the satraps, which were once the traditional vote of the Congress
 khaskar dalit, pichhada or alpsankhyak
 That is why Ashok Tanwar or Rajiv Satava or Shanimol Osman
 rahul ne najariya saaf rakhaa he ki kshetra, jatiy ganit or raajnneetik samaj ke daayre main unki team paardarshee dikhaayi deni chaiye
 Rahul wants to replace at least 4 of the party's 9 general secretaries, who may be discharged include Mohsina Kidwai and Gurucharan Charak, while Dhani Ram Shandilya has already been given the new responsibility of being removed from the post of general secretary
 iske saath hi rahul ne pradeshon main adhyaksh badalane kii kavayad shuru kar di he, jisaki shuruyaat punjab main pratap singh bajva ko congress adhyaksh bana kar di he
 It is clear that Rahul wants to play freely
 jyotishshastra ke mutabik insaan kii alag-alag banaavat uske vyaktitv ke bare main bahut kuch kahati he
 From toe to toe, there are hidden marks of luck
 aaie jaanate hai kya kehete hai aapke sharir ke ang
 Toe - Toe shows the influence of a person and his spiritual interest
 - agar pair kaa angootha zyada bada or lambaa ho to vyakti saral or dharm karm vaala hota he
 - If the right toe is longer than the toe, then the person is highly effective
 - agar pair kaa angootha zyada chota ho to vyakti keval dhan kii hi chintaa karata rahata he or dusron ko nuksaan pahunchane se baj nahin aata
 Hand fingers- If the fingers of the hand are long and thin, then the person is artistic, simple, does not get into a lot of screws
 - anguliyaan agar moti or sakht hon to vyakti ko jarurat se zyada sangharsh karnaa padataa he, aise logon kii vaani badi kathor hoti he
 If the fingers are crooked, the person gets a lot of money, but he has to face many problems regarding health
 - anguliyaan agar ganthdaar hon to vyakti jarurat se zyada swaarthee hota he, keval dhan kii firaaq main laga rahata he
 Ears - The ears grow bigger indicating longer lifespan
 - kaan chote hone se vyakti kii aayu kam ho jaati he, saath hi durghatnaon ke sanket milte hai
 - Due to hair on the ear, a person reaches very high levels from a very small level and lives a long life
 - kaan kii lau lambi ho to vyakti kaaphi prabhaavshaalee hota he, rishton ko samajhataa he or nibhaataa he
 Nails - If the hands are long and beautiful the person is lucky
 - nakhun tede-medhe hon to vyakti ko atyadhik sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 - If the crescent moon is big on the nails, then the person is protected from diseases, if it is not, then the person suffers the disease for a long time
 - nakhunon par agar safed nishaan yaa bindu ban gaye hon to kisi rog kii soochna dete hai
 Brow - If the brow is thick then the nature of the person is simple
 hont or daanton kii banaavat se jaaniye apni kismat- agar donon bhunh aapas main sat jaay to vyakti kaaphi krodhi hota he, vaani par niyantran nahin hota
 - If the brow is torn, then the person suffers a lot of mental pain
 - agar bhunh neeche kii ore jhuk rahi ho to vyakti kaa jhukaav vairaygy kii ore ho jaataa he,aise log kabhi kabhi ghar dwaar tyaag dete hai
 Hair of hands and feet - It is good for men to have more hair in their hands and feet, such men are simple and confident
 jaane- aapke andar koun si aisi baat he jisase aap ban sakate hai bhaagyashaalee- mahilaon ke haath or pairon main zyada bal hona acha nahin hota, aisi mahilaon ko jivan main durbhaagya kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 - If a man is simple and good-natured, then his hair and legs start to have thick hair
 - jin logon ko man kii chintaaen zyada hoti hai, chaahe wo stri hon yaa purush, unako baalo ke girane kii samasya hone lagati he

 Vijendra said, 'kejriwal government has always deliberately taken the path of confrontation with the central government regarding the metro, sometimes in the name of a fixed amount of share and sometimes in the name of construction of Phase-4
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne hi meerut dilli kshetreey rapid transit system ko bhi jaan boojhkar 2 saal se latakaaya hua he
 Even the airing of DTC buses for women safety proved to be airborne
 'gupta ne kaha, 'kejariwal sarkaar pichley chaar saalon main ditisi ke bede main ek bhi nai bas nahin jod pai
 In these 4 years, the dtc's credibility was questioned
 ditisi bas seva main sudhaar karne ke bajaae aam aadmi party ke kaarykaal main ditisi bas seva or kharaab sthiti main pahunch gai
 It is said by the Transport Minister that it will take 6 months for women to implement the scheme of free travel in bus and metro, in which the ethics of conduct will be implemented
 isliye na no man tel hoga na radha naachegi'
 Gupta said that in order to divert attention from his failures, Kejriwal wants to mislead people by leaving a Shigufa before the election
 bataa den ki aam aadmi party kii sarkaar mahilaon ko ditisi bason or metro main muft safar kii skim dene kii taiyaari par vichaar kar rahi he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who arrived in New Delhi assembly constituency late Saturday to meet people in Lodhi Colony, has told women to travel free in DTC buses and Metro

 '' Google aapaki baaten sunata he! Google aapako trek karata he! Google aapke bihaviour par najar rakhata he! is tarah kii chijen aapane pehle bhi suni hongi

 Not without your consent
 wo alag baat he ki aap wo terms or condishan dhyaan se shaayad nahin padhate hai or 'yes i Agree' par clic karte hai
 However, this time Google has assumed that Google employees listen to audio recordings of Google Home Smart Speakers
 google is tarah ke recordings ko sunne ke liye language exparts rakhata he
 These experts listen to the words given by the users to the Google Home Assistant or, say, the commands given to them
 kul mila kar ye he ki aapaki baatcheet suni jaati he, chaahe company koi bhi daleel kyon na de
 Google says that users' recordings are listened to so that voice recognition technology can be improved
 lekin kya iske liye yujar kii privesi ke saath ek tarah kaa khilwaad kiya janaa jaij he? ye bada sawaal he, jiskaa jawaab Google se maanga janaa chahie
 According to Google, Google experts listen to voice recordings so that Google can improve technology like Assistant
 google dwaara jari kiye gaye ek bayaan main company ne kaha he
 'google transcribes unknown recordings in small numbers
 (aisa exparts karte hai)
 Google has said, 'we partnered with language experts around the world to improve speech technology by transcribing queries on a smaller scale'
 And it is also necessary for products like Google Assistant
 haalanki google ne ye bhi kaha he ki language exparts sirf 0
 2% review audio snippets only and these snippets are not linked to user accounts under review process
 Google Assistant company kaa virtual assistant he jo aapako har android smartphone main ab miltaa he
 Google Assistant is also given in smart speakers like Google Home and users interact with Google Assistant and give the commands they need
 udhaaharan ke taur par aapke paas Google Home smart spikar he or aap ghar main ise yuj karte hai
 Obviously you must have given it commands
 kuch commands personal honge, jise aap kisi duusare ke saath share karnaa nahin chahenge
 But if Google employees listen to it, then it will really be like a privacy breech for you
 google kii daleel ye he ki company aisa isliye karti he, taaki spich ricognishan technolji ko behatar banaaya ja sake
 However, this is not the first time such news has come
 isse pehle bhi reports ai thim
 Although that was a different matter
 google se puche gaye sawaal, yani Google Assistant se bolkar aap jo bhi poochhate hai wo google ke paas store rahata he
 You can listen to it yourself
 iske liye aapako apane Gmail acount ko acces karke audio nikaalnaa hoga
 Google Voice & Audio Activity This feature is under Google Voice & Audio Activity
 google ke mutabik company aapaki wais or duusare audio Ok Google commands ke samay record karata he
 The recorded voice commands are saved in the company user account
 khaas baat ye he ki is tarah ke audio ofline hone ke baavdood seve hote hai

 Lee, who is the second member of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee after President Xi Jinping, says China's relations with India are "historic occasions" and call for an early resolution of the border dispute
 Do, what they call "an omitted problem of history"
 kuch anshkpradhanmantri kaa padbhaar sanbhaalane ke baad may, 2013 main aapane apni pehali videsh yatra ke liye bharat ko chunaa tha
 What was the reason for your choice? Are you satisfied with the way the relationship between the two countries has developed since then? i visited India two years ago as the first stop of my first foreign trip as Prime Minister
 vah yatra meri smriti main ab bhi taaja he
 China and India are the world's two largest developing countries and the two most vibrant emerging markets
 china-bharat ke badhate hue sambandh na sirf 2
 The 5 billion are associated with the welfare of the Chinese and Indians, but also important for the peace and prosperity of Asia and the world at large
 meri us yatra ke dauraan bhartiya netaa or main is baat par sahamat hue the ki donon deshon ko saajhe vikaas ko hasil karne ke liye, asian sahyog main nae kirtiman or vishwa arthvyavastha ke liye ek nayaa ingine banane ke liye haath milaane chahie
 a new India government was formed after last year's general election
 main yah dekhakar khush hum ki china-bharat sambandh or vyaavhaarik sahyog ne thos gati banaae rakhi he or nai pragati bhi kii he
 This shows that the development of china-india relations has a general consensus and deep popular support among different sections of both countries
 china or bharat, donon ke hi saamne arthvyavastha kaa vikaas karne, sudhaaron ko gahare le jane or logon ke jivan str main sudhaar karne kaa aitihaasik lakshya he
 Steadily following the path marked by leaders of both sides, china-india relations are taking advantage of the historic opportunity for substantial growth
 main apeksha karata hum ki pradhanmantri modi kii aagaamee china yatra hamaari samrik or sahakaari saajhedaari ko gaharaa karegi or ham donon deshon ke shantipurna, sahyogi or samaveshi vikaas ke lakshya kii purti karegi
 What is your perception about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first year in office? In his first year, Prime Minister Modi has demonstrated his resolve and courage to pursue reform and development
 bhartiya arthvyavastha ne ullekhneey gati pakadi he
 The international community has been closely watching the developments and changes happening in India for the last one year
 antarrashtriya niveshkon ne “india aportunity” par apana dhyaan nae sire se kendrit kiya he or bharat ke vikaas kii sambhaavnaaon main aashaa vyakt kii he
 i want to congratulate Prime Minister Modi and the Indian Government
 bharat kii vikaas uplabdhiyon se china khush he
 The Indian economy is moving towards a higher growth rate, while the Chinese economy is changing and renewing at a faster pace
 vikaas kii ek jaisi drushti or mahaan aarthik poorakta ke saath hamaare donon desh ek-duusare ke vikaas main maukey dekh sakate hai
 China stands ready to work with India to align with its development strategies, strengthen political trust, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, and progress together through mutual learning and support
 aarthik morche par, pichley kuch varshon se sambandh dhime rahe hai or unamem oochaal nahin aa sakaa he
 In the trade, India is dominating the export of resources and China in the export of machinery
 kharid or bikri se pare najdiki aarthik sambandh or paraspar nivesh bahut dhime se bade hai
 What do you think is the reason? Economic relations between China and India cover a wide range of areas
 maal ke paramparaagat vyapaar ke alaava, ham sevaaon, paryaton, nivesh or vitt kshetron main vyapaar karte hai
 Let me give you some examples
 chini kaarobaariyon ke bharat main nivesh main ab teji se vruddhi ho rahi he
 Cooperation between the two sides, among other things, on railways and industrial parks is now taking place with a wide potential
 jahaan tak mujhe pataa he, 10 bhartiya bainkon ne china main 13 shakhaon kii sthapana kii he, jo unke chini samakakshon kii bharat main sthapit shakhaon se kaaphi adhik hai
 Indian companies have investments in a wide range of sectors in China, including software, pharmaceutical, higher education, iron and steel, chemical industries and clean energy
 is vajah se ham apane aarthik sambandhon kaa akalan karne main vastuon ke vyapaar ko ekmaatr kasuti ke rup main nahin dekhte hai
 If we just look at the trade in goods, the bilateral trade volume has started increasing again from last year, despite some decline for two years after the international financial crisis
 isamen saal dar saal 7
 It has increased at the rate of 8 percent and it is 70
 6 arab dollar par pahunch gaya he
 China understands India's concern for the balance of trade and takes it seriously
 ham china main bechi ja sakane yogya vastuon kaa bharat se aayaat badhaane ke liye kadam uthaanaa jari rakhane ke liye taiyaar hai or maal ke vyapaar, sevaaon ke vyapaar, nivesh, vigyaan or praudyogiki tathaa paryaton kshetron sahit ek vyapak daayre main santulan kii talash karnaa chaahate hai
 In this manner, we hope that we can achieve dynamic equilibrium and sustainable growth in bilateral trade
 jaisaa main dekhtaa hum, 2
 For China and India, in terms of two countries with a combined population of 5 billion, our cooperation is far below its appropriate scale or level
 china or bharat ke bich sahyog ek bahut bada khajaana he, jo apni talash kiye jane kii pratiksha kar rahaa he
 We have many hopes and expectations
 pradhanmantri modi kii is yatra ke dauraan ham donon deshon ke bich vyaavhaarik sahyog ko gaharaa banane ke vishay par aage vichaaron kaa aadan-pradaan karenge
 i am sure that with our joint efforts, our economic relations will soon ride on the high speed train, benefit our people and give a powerful boost to our national rejuvenation efforts
 jab raashtrapati shi jinping sitambar main bharat daure par aae the, tab donon paksh bijli companiyon or automobiles par dhyaan kendrit karne vaali chini companiyon ke liye do audyogic park sthapit karne par raji hue the
 In the future, will major Chinese companies see India not just as a market for exports, but also as a manufacturing base? What do you think about what can be gained from these industrial parks later? During his visit to India, President Xi Jinping reached an important agreement with Indian leaders on the issue of cooperation on industrial parks in India
 china or bharat kramshah duniya ke pramukh menuphacturer or seva pradaata hai
 Both have certain characteristics, and because of them both economies have much for each other
 philhal china kii arthvyavastha madhyam se ucch str kii ore bad rahi he, or koshishen kii ja rahi hai ki vikaas kii gati madhyam se ucch banaai rakhi jaae
 We will accelerate reforms all-round and open up more to the world
 agle paanch saal main china kaa videshi nivesh 500 arab dollar tak pahunch jayega
 The goi's Make in India and other programs aim to promote improvement and innovation, raise the level of manufacturing and attract more foreign investment
 aisi paristhitiyon main, vyaavhaarik sahyog ko majboot bananaa donon pakshon ke liye kahin zyada praasangik or kahin zyada ummiido se bharaa he
 Chinese companies have decided to set up two industrial parks in India, a major step towards strengthening practical cooperation between the two countries
 ek bahut bade bazaar or samrudh maanav sansadhano ke saath bharat main ek bada menuphaccharing desh banane ke liye sabhi aavashyak sthitiyaan maujuud hai
 i hope that India will provide more favored policies and investment facilities for Chinese businessmen, help them overcome the inconveniences and difficulties that may be brought up so that the industrial park will be a major project of sino-india practical cooperation
 Provide solid benefits ahead of time
 ham china main bhi bhartiya companiyon kii adhik-se-adhik upasthiti kaa swaagat karte hai
 For the past one year, the Chinese government has initiated initiatives to build a Silk Road economic strip connecting Central Asia as well as a maritime silk route connecting Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean region
 is pattee or sadak dhaanche ke tahat china bharat ke saath kis tarah kaam karnaa chahta he?china or bharat asia main do sabase bade desh hai or donon kshetra main pramukh mahatv ke hai
 We are taking the responsibility of working together to promote cooperation and prosperity in this wider region
 yahi vajah he ki 2013 main apni bharat yatra ke dauraan, maine bhartiya paksh ke saath bangladesh-china-bharat-myanmar aarthik coridor (bisiiem) ke nirmaan kii pahal kaa maamla uthaaya, is prastaav ko kvayanmar or bangladesh se sakaaratmak pratikriya mili he
 The strip and route initiatives, as well as BCIM, are designed to facilitate common development rather than in the interests of China alone
 vartmaan main, china-bharat sahyog railway main, audyogic parkon main or anya kshetron main jabardast tarakkee kar rahaa he
 a joint working group has been set up for BCIM and it is progressing well
 bharat asian buniyadi dhaancha nivesh bank (eiibi) ke bhavi sansthaapak sadasyon ke pehle samooh main shaamil tha or bharat ne eiibi ke mukhya vaartakaron kii duusari baithak kii mejabani kii he
 This point strongly supports the fact that China and India are indeed strategic partners of each other, whether bilaterally or regionally
 china pattee or maarg sambandhi pahal ke sambandh main bharat ke vichaaron or sujhaavon ko sunne ke liye taiyaar he
 China will fully respect and resolve India's concerns and will work with India to find a unity of interests between the two countries, find avenues of cooperation in which both will win and which will be in the region Will jointly promote development and prosperity
 bharat ke saath sambandhon ke vikaas ko aap kaise dekhte hai? pichley do dashakon se donon desh vivaadon ko pare rakhane or anya kshetron main sambandhon ko aage badhaane ke deng shiyaoping ke sujhaaye dhaanche par chalane kii koshish karte rahe hai
 How successful has this approach been? Do you think that the time has come to adopt a more proactive approach to resolving the pending dispute such as the boundary question at once? Different views exist naturally between neighboring countries on certain issues
 main is baat par jor dena chahta hum ki china or bharat ke liye, dwipaksheeya sambandhon kii visheshta dosti or sahyog se paribhaashit ho rahi he
 i see a desire and need for cooperation on both sides, and i believe that our shared interests outweigh our disagreements
 itane varshon main, hamaare donon deshon ke netaa ek mahatvapurn samjhaute par pahunche haih yah ki donon deshon ko sabhi staron par or sabhi kshetron main dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko apgrade karne kii jarurat he, jabaki matbhedon ko baatcheet ke jariye or shantipurna tareekon se ek uchit, tarkpurna or ek-duusare ko sweekaarya tareeke se suljhaayaa janaa chahie, or yah ki matbhedon ko dwipaksheeya sambandhon ke samgr vikaas ko prabhavit karne kii anumati nahin di jaani chahie
 The agreement provides a new basis for the long-term and stable development of china-india relations
 yah kahana uchit hi he ki china or bharat ne adwitiya sambandh viksit kiye hai, jisamen matbhedon kaa uchit bandobast karne kaa prayaas karte hue, hamen apni dosti or sahyog ko viksit karne kii anumati he
 The boundary question is a problem that has been going on since history, and it is a difficult question in bilateral relations
 is prashn ko jitani jaldi ho sake, suljhaana ek aitihaasik jimmedaari he, jo donon sarkaron par lagu hoti he
 It also represents the common aspirations of the people of both countries
 sanyukt prayaason ke boote, pichley 30 varsh or usase bhi adhik samay main, seemaa vaarta main pragati hui he
 The two sides have prepared a roadmap to address the boundary question, signed the agreement on its political parameters and guiding principles, and reached an important agreement for lump sum settlement through meaningful and mutually acceptable adjustments
 is dauraan puure seemaa kshetra par shanti or sthirataa rahi he
 This is an important achievement for both sides
 jo uplabdhi hasil kii gai he, hamen usase aage badhanaa chahie, or ek nishpaksh, uchit or paraspar sweekaarya samaadhaan ko praapt karne kii drushti ke saath seemaa vaarta prakriya ko aage le jane ke liye athak mehnat kerani chahie
 Until this is resolved, both sides need to work together to maintain peace and harmony in the border areas, so that we can foster an enabling environment for the final settlement of the boundary question and the overall development of bilateral relations To promote

 aap ubhartee hui vishwa vyavastha ko kaise dekhte hai? china aksar bahudhruviya vishwa kii aavashyaktaa ke bare main bolta rahaa he
 How much agreement is there between China and India on this subject? Will China support a greater role for India in international institutions like the United Nations, including the inclusion of India as a permanent member of the expanded Security Council? Moving towards a multi-polar world is a prevalent trend in today's world
 sadi ke ant ke baad se, asia, africa or latin america main ubharate hue bazaaron or vikasshil deshon kii antarrashtriya sthiti main vikaas hua he, jisase shakti kaa santulan adhik santulit sthiti kii ore badha he
 China and India are the two major powers in forging a multi-polar world, as well as two engines that accelerate economic growth in Asia and the world
 china or bharat, donon ubharate bazaaron or vikasshil deshon ke pratinidhi hone ke naate, vaishvik maamalon main thos samanvay or sahyog main lage hue hai, jahaan hamen samaan chunautiyon kaa saamana karnaa hota he or hamaare saajha vyapak aam hit hote hai
 sino-india relations have gone far beyond the bilateral scope and have regional and global significance
 china or bharat kii sanyukt aabaadi duniya kii kul aabaadi kii ek-tihaai se adhik he
 When we talk in unison, the world will listen; When we join hands, the world will pay attention
 apane swayan ke vikaas ke madhyam se asia or vishwa ke aarthik vikaas ko badhaate hue, china or bharat sanyukt raashtra, bricks, ji-20 or shanghai sahyog sanghathan sahit bahupaksheeya dhaanche ke antargat sahyog ko sudrudh karnaa jari rakh sakate hai
 In this manner we can make the international system more just and rational
 vaishvik prabhaav vaala ek pramukh asian desh or bricks kaa ahm sadsy bharat, dakshin asia or asia-prashanth kshetra main sthirataa or samruddhi sunishchit karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 China attaches great importance to India's role in international affairs as a major developing country and supports India's aspiration to play a larger role in the United Nations, including the UN Security Council
 kshetra main china or bharat ke ek saath kaam karne par aapke kya vichaar hai? china main haal hi main kai aatankwaadi hamale hue hai, or aatankwaad ke prasar par bharat kii lambey samay se vyakt chintaa ko dekhte hue, donon desh is mudde par kis tarah se ek saath kaam kar sakate hai?china dakshin asia ke deshon kaa sabase bada padosi he, or dakshin asia main shanti or sthirataa kaa prabhaav china kii sthirataa or vikaas par padataa he
 China and India have a common interest in maintaining peace and stability in South Asia and promoting growth and prosperity
 afghanistan main shanti or punarnirmaan kaa samarthan karne main or nepal main aapadaa raahat or punarnirmaan prayaason kii sahaayta main china or bharat ke bich acha samvaad or samanvay rahaa he
 The two countries can increase cooperation on the basis of their respective strengths in fostering efforts to maintain peace, stability and development in the region and inject more positive energy
 aatankwaad, jiske mul kaaran jatil hai, maanav jati kaa saajha dushman he
 It will take hard effort and long time to solve the problem
 aatankwaad kaa unmoolan karne or is kshetra main or vishwa main suraksha or sthirataa kii raksha ke liye antarrashtriya samudaay main ekajutata or majboot sahyog kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Both China and India have faced the crisis of terrorism and because of this they both share interests and both face the same challenges in fighting terrorism
 china bharat ke saath aatankwaad virdohi sahyog gaharaa karne ke liye taiyaar he, taaki hamaare donon deshon ke vikaas or suraksha ke hiton kii behatar raksha kii ja sake

 If the BSP strategists believe that the BSP supremo has called this rally obviously against the foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail trade and the increase in the price of diesel, but in the wake of the Mahasankalp rally, it wants to regain its old reputation in Uttar Pradesh Huh

 Know how Manveer Gurjarmanveer, who won Bigg Boss 10, told that i did not think that my brothers will welcome me so much

 It is not easy to start the castartup itself
 is shuru karne ke liye pehle kai planning karne kii jarurat hoti he
 If you want to start your own business
 to pehle in baton ko apane dimag main daal len
 About the new business only after that
 
 All these things will prove to be helpful in your business
 jaane- ye jaruri baaten
 
 1
 Any startup needs a good idea to start
 isliye kisi bhi bijness ko shuru karne se pehle bijness kaa idia jarur soch len
 Also, think about the power of the subject on which you are going to build your entire business
 yani aapke kaam ko kis tarah pasand karenge
 Make a complete plan of it
 2
 If you are starting a business on a large scale then first know how you will raise money
 saath yadi aap lone lene ke bare main soch rahe hai to pehle isaki puri jaankaree bator len
 3
 koi bhi starop shuru karne se pehle aapako market kaa haal jaananaa sabase zyada jaruri he
 So whenever you think of a startup, do market research
 4
 People face a lot of problem with the selection of names
 yadi aap apane bijness ke naam ko bhavishya main ek badabrandabananaa chaahate hai, to naam chota or saral hona hi sochen
 5
 bijness chota ho yaa bada koi bhi bijness aap akele shuru nahin kar sakate
 So find a co-founder before startup
 taaki aapako bijness main madad milti rahe
 6
 apane bijness ko register karana jaruri he
 Because to become a good and successful businessman, you have to do all the legal work, for this you can consult a legal advisor
 7
 No matter what the business is, you know how close you are to that business
 yani kya vah aapako pishan hai? yadi haa to aapako is bijness main khadaa karne ke liye zyada samay nahin lagegaa
 8
 bijness shuru karnaa he to risk to lenaa hi hoga
 Whether any business will run or not can not be said in the beginning
 aise main paison kaa adhiknuksaanan ho
 It is necessary to be prepared in advance for this

 The father and son were shy about going to class together, so their father did not go to the class in which Atal ji used to go
 ' pita or putr diavi hostel ke cameraa number 104 main badi saadagi se rahete the
 They cooked and ate food themselves and washed clothes on their own
 diavi main padhai ke dauraan hi atal ji aresas ke sampark main aae or raajnneeti se jud gaye
 Ram Mohan says' Atal ji's teacher of political science department while studying at DAV College, Dr
 madan mohan pandeya se gaharaa lagaav ho gaya
 On the day Pandey ji did not come to take classes in the college, on that day Atal Bihari Vajpayee sought the bicycle of a colleague and reached the house of his Guru Ji living in house 108-88 in Pirod, Kanpur

 Bajrang Sharan Tiwari on Hewett Road was one of his integral friends

 'chandra Bhanu Gupta was the Chief Minister of the state at that time in the Congress government
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ne vyangyatmak lahaze main na keval pradesh kii sarkaar ko kathghare main khadaa kar diya balki apni deree kaa kaaran bhi bataa diya
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee lost elections from Lucknow and Mathura but the people of Balrampur sent him to Parliament
 haalanki jansangh ne jab vaajapeyi ko apana ummidavaar ghoshit kiya tab unhembalrampur main koi pahachaanata hi nahin tha
 After being declared a candidate, Atal Bihari Vajpayee left from Lucknow towards Balrampur by train
 balarapur main vaajapeyi kii train raat das baje pahunchi
 Jana Sangh District General Secretary Ram Dulare Pathak did not recognize Atal Bihari Vajpayee who came to pick him up
 train ke dibbon or platform par kaaphi dhudhane ke baad jab pathak platform se baahar nikalne lage to peeche se ek aawaaj ne unhen chaunkaa diya 'pathak ji aap kise dhundh rahe hai?' pathak ne bhi prashn poochne vaale vyakti kii ore mukhaatib hote hue kaha 'atal ji aane vaale the

 In Balrampur, veteran BJP leader Latbaksha Singh says, 'atal Bihari Vajpayee was resting the night in Chaukhra village during the election campaign in Balrampur in 1957

 The driver said that the vehicle should not run in the mud
 tab palki kaa intjaam kiya gaya lekin atal bihari ne isamen baithne se inkaar kar diya
 After this he reached Utraula, sitting on the mare of an acquaintance and addressed a public meeting here
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa balrampur se raajnneetik safar varsh 1957 se 1971 tak rahaa haalanki varsh 1962 ke chunaav main unhen congressi netaa subhadra joshi se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday held non-congress governments responsible for slowing down the pace of development work in Bundelkhand, spread over the territory of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, to prove that the package announced for improving the situation in this area is worthwhile
 The governments of the Center and these two states will have to work in mutual coordination
 pradhanmantri ne bundelkhand kshetra ke banda jile main ek raily ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki kendra kii samprag sarkaar bundelkhand ke vikaas ke liye patibaddh he or sarkaar is kshetra ke halaat badalegi
 Giving information about the special package of Rs 7266 crore released by the Center for Bundelkhand in the year 2009, he said, 'congress governments, whether they are at the center or in the states, have always taken care of the interests of the people of Bundelkhand and here
 
 duusari ore gaiyr congress sarkaron ke kaarykaal main is kshetra ke vikaas kii raftaar dhimi padi he
 'manmohan said,' The irrigation projects started by the Congress government in Bundelkhand are still incomplete
 ’ unhone kaha ‘kendra sarkaar ne bundelkhand main vikaas kii kami ko sudhaarney ke liye jo koshishen shuru kii hai unhen safal banane ke liye uttar pradesh or madhya pradesh kii sarkaron ko mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaani hogi
 'singh alleged,' The Uttar Pradesh government did not show the requisite speed in using the funds released in addition to the package for the development of Bundelkhand
 hamen aashaa he ki bhavishya main halaat main sudhaar hoga
 He said that the condition of Bundelkhand has worsened since the year 2004-05
 pichley kai vashro se yahaan lagaataar sookhaa pad rahaa he
 The UPA government had constituted a Group of Ministers in the year 2008 and a Bundelkhand Development Package was prepared in the year 2009 to take measures to deal with the situation
 unhone kaha ki bundelkhand ke liye 7266 karod rupye kharch honge
 Of this, 3506 crore will be spent for Uttar Pradesh and the remaining 3760 crore will be spent for Madhya Pradesh
 bundelkhand main peyajal tathaa sinchai ke liye pani kii khaasi killat kii taraf ishaara karte hue pradhanmantri ne kaha, ‘vishesh package ke atirikt hamane bundelkhand ke gramin kshetron main pine ke pani kii vyavastha ke liye 200 karod rupye kaa prastaav taiyaar kiya he
 i hope we will approve this proposal in May
 isse is kshetra main peyajal kii killat dur karne main kaaphi had tak madad milegi
 "he said" We have laid special emphasis on water system in the Bundelkhand Package
 iske tahat vashra ke jal ko ekatra karne or nadiyon ke pani kaa sahi istemaal karne ko badhaava diya jayega
 Special attention will also be paid to farming and efforts will be made to increase the yield of crops
 saath hi kisaanon kii aamadani badhaane ke liye pashupaalan tathaa deyari kaaryo kaa vistaar kiya jayega
 'manmohan said' Congress General Secretary Rahul Gandhi told me about the need to open an agricultural university in Jhansi
 is prastaav par uttar pradesh sarkaar kii sahmati le lee gai he or jhaansi main ek kendriya krishi vishvavidhyalay kholane ke liye sansad main ek vidheyak laane kii disha main kaam shuru kar diya gaya he
 In the last two financial years under the 'manmohan said' package, we have released additional central assistance of about Rs 1800 crore
 rajya sarkaron dwaara pehle di gai dhanrashi kaa istemaal kar lene ke baad unhen is saal kii dhanrashi di jaaegi
 He said, "the success of the Bundelkhand package depends on how much the central, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh governments work together
" hamaare jo bhi raajnneetik matbhed hon, unhen bhulaakar hamen bundelkhand ke vikaas ke liye ek hokar aage badhanaa chaiye
 We will pay attention to the suggestions given in relation to the package
 saath hi yah bhi chaahate hai ki sambandhit rajya sarkarein is package ko lagu karne main koi kami nahin aane den
 The Prime Minister said that to meet the power needs of the Bundelkhand region, NTPC is setting up a 3600 MW super thermal power plant in Barethi area of madhya Pradesh
 april 2010 se kendriya utpaadan kendron se bundelkhand ke liye bijli ke aavaton main badhottaree kii gai he
 Due to this increase, 500 MW additional power is being given to Bundelkhand, out of which 300 MW is for Uttar Pradesh
 manmohan ne kaha, ‘logon ko praathmik swasthya sevaaon kii jaruratein puri karne ke liye pradhanmantri swasthya suraksha yojana ke tisare charan main sarkari medical college ke unnayan ke liye mote taur par manjuuri de di gai he
 To provide good education in the districts of Bundelkhand where Kendriya Vidyalayas are not already there
 vahaan saat kendriya vidhyalay kholane kii manjuuri de di gai he
 'the Prime Minister said,' Both the State Governments will also have to play an important role in the efforts made by the Central Government to remove the lack of development of Bundelkhand

 On Monday, JDU chief Sharad Yadav sparked another controversy by demanding that the practice of awarding the Padma award after accusing the Padma award of "dishonest" people
 unka maananaa he ki yah logon ke bade hisse ke khilaaf ‘‘bhedbhaav’’ karata he
 "it should be stopped," he told reporters
 yah puraskaar mutthi bhar logon ke liye he jo vyavastha ke kareeb rahete hai
 He said that no such official honors were given to any of the previous 'janata Parivar' regimes
 yadav ne kaha ki tatkaaleen raashtrapati apije abdul kalam ne sammaanon main ‘‘aniyamittaaon’’ ke bare main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi ko ek note bheja tha
 He said that this year these awards were not given to anyone from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Minorities and Farmer Communities
 jab yah charchaa kii gai ki mashhoor abhinayta dilip kumaar jo muslim hai, ko is saal padam vibhushan diya gaya he, is bich yadav ne kaha ki dilip kumaar or amitabh bachchan jaise log aisi pahchaan se kahin aage hai
 He alleged at an event in Mumbai last week that the Padma awards are given only to "dishonest" people and to the higher classes of society
 unhone kaha ki saamaajik or aarthik rup se pichde logon ke khilaaf bhedbhaav lambey samay se hota rahaa he lekin is baar narendra modi sarkaar ke pehle saal yah bhedbhaav sabhi simaaon ko paar kar gaya
 Yadav, however, refused to name and also said that some of them are entitled to the award, but a large section of people have been ignored
 unhone daawa kiya ki media ne unki baat ko sandarbh se alag hatakar pesh kiya
 He had said that the process of selection of these awards is "dishonest"
 unhone kaha, ‘‘main, phir bhi, is bahes kaa swaagat karata hum
 There is not as much discrimination in a country as we do
 maine jo kaha he, vah nayaa nahin hai or lambey samay se yah hamaara rukh rahaa he
 Yadav said that during the Janata Party government that came to power in 1977 and later the United Front government, these honors were not given
 unhone aresas ke is aarope ko lekar bhi us par nishaanaa saadhaa ki janata parivaar modi sarkaar ke khilaaf asprishyata ko badhaava de rahaa he
 He alleged that discrimination against Muslims and Christians has increased since the BJP came to power

 ’’ Entries were called to the palace for dress on the advice of Begum Akhtar: Yatindravidya Shah: My Guru Shanti Begum Akhtar's very close and favorite disciple Rahimparda Girwarkar smoked the capston cigarette on the stage Begum Akhtar: Yatindra Misrishyatha's greatest Mahakumbh 'sahitya Aaj Tak 2019' Gajal singer Begum Akhtar was discussed in a seminar organized on the topic 'hi Akhtari' in which many untouched aspects came to the fore e and outside of singing in their life has missed several excellent accounts
 begum akhtar se judi kitaab likhane vaale yatindra mishra ne bataaya ki ek baar begum sahiba ko minaa kumari kaa ek dress behad pasand aayaa to unhone unki maa se yahi dress silvane ko kaha, jiske liye film se reel hi katwa lee thi
 'hi Akhtari' was a seminar based on Ghazal singer Begum Akhtar
 begum akhtar ek mahaan fankara rahi hai or ghazal gayikee main unki koi sani nahin he
 Begum Akhtar liked the dress: Yatindra Mishra, who wrote a book on several Azim funkars in the field of Yatindragayiki, recalled the version associated with Begum Akhtar, saying that Begum Akhtar used to sing in the courts
 vah unke rajpariwaar main bhi niyamit antaraal main gane aayaa karti thim
 Once Begum Akhtar liked a dress of Meena Kumari in the movie Chaudhvi Ka Chand
 minaa kumari ne is seen main paf vaala ek blouse pahan rakhaa tha
 Begum advised her mother to wear a similar dress
 lekhak yatindra mishra (sahitya ajtak)begum akhtar kii salaah ke baad maa ne yah dress silvane ke liye tamaam dargiyon ko rajmahal main bulawaaya
 But after many attempts, he could not imitate the dress Meena Kumari wore because the scene of the film would go ahead
 is bare main jab begum akhtar ko jaankaree mili to unhone film main us seen se judi reel hi katwa liya
 When the filmmaker came to know about this, he filed a case against the family
 unhone bataaya ki begum sahiba behad saaf dimag or khule dimag vaali mahila thi, jo kuch bhi pasand hota us par apni raah jaahir kar detii thim
 Singer, composer and writer Vidya Shah, who sang Ghazals sung by Begum Akhtar in her own style, said, 'my Guru Shanti Guru Hiranand ji has been a very close disciple of Begum Akhtar
 shanti ji kaa unke saath behad kareebi rishta rahaa or unke saath unase lanbaa naata saath rahaa or yahi kaaran he ki begum akhtar ke saath unka itnaa gaharaa lagaav hua
 Also, another reason for my attachment to Begum was that Begum Akhtar's attitude was feminist and i too remained attached to it
 'sound ejeeniyar ne sujhaayaa tha nambegam akhtar par akhtari naam kii kitaab likhane vaale yatindra mishra ne bataaya ki begum sahiba mere yahaan darbar lagaaya karti thi
 But he was born after Akhtari's death
 isliye unke bare main kitaab likhane ke liye unke daur main rahe bade fankaaron se mulaakaat kii or unase jude sansmaranon or gayikee ke bare main baat karke kitaab likhane kii koshish kii
 He made it clear that this book is not written by him but edited

 In Literature Aaj Tak 2019, Yayatindra said, 'every character has the effect of environment and environment
 main jab bhi bade or diggaj hastiyon se baat karata tha to unke lahaze kaa dhyaan rakhata tha
 When talking to Lata Mangeshkar about Begum Akhtar, her dialect used to be a Marathi put, in the same way she retained the idiom style of Bismillah Khan and the style of Sonam Mansingh with her own style
 taaki vahaan kaa pataa chal sake
 Singer and musician Vidya Shah said that Begum Akhtar was earlier known as Akhtari Bai Faizabadi, but later on her name became Begum Akhtar
 begum akhtar naam kahaan se aayaa is par vidya shah ne bataaya ki vivaah ke dauraan hataasha ke daur se baahar nikalne ke baad jab vah gayikee kii field main waapas lautin to unka pehla kaarykram lakhanu akashwani main tha, tab yah charchaa hui ki unka naam kya rakhaa jaae
 Meanwhile the sound engineer suggested the name
 koyaliya mat kar pukaar naam ke liye begum akhtar kaa naam saamne aayaa
 Sung 'koyaliya Mat Kar Pukar' with this new name
 gayika, sangeetkaar or lekhika vidya shah (sahitya ajtak)pardaa giraakar cigarette piti thim begum sahibah yatindrayatindra mishra ne kaha ki begum akhtar apni sharton par jiti thim
 During the stage performance, she smoked Capston cigarettes with a curtain and the listener waited until they were drinking
 vah kisi kii farmaaish nahin leti thi
 She used to sing whatever she wanted
 vah tab tak nahin gaati thi jab tak unhen yah aihsaas na ho jaae ki shrota sunne kii sthiti main aa gaya he
 The delayed listener had to sit back

 Both authors also point out that Begum Akhtar was a very brilliant woman, but a woman who soon became upset and happy

 The diplomatic relationship between the two countries is not surprising given that Saudi Arabia's embassy and consulate in Tehran were attacked after the death penalty to a prominent Shia cleric in Saudi Arabia

 On April 25, the three army chiefs of India released a 62-page document containing security threats facing the country

 Also, China and Pakistan face a strategic challenge
 aise main is siddhant patr ko jari karne kaa isse behatar samay nahin ho saktaa tha
 The document, titled Joint Doctrine for the Armed Forces (joint Principles for the Armed Forces), issued on April 26 in the hands of Admiral Sunil Lamba, Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), enumerates threats to national security and ways for the three armies to deal with them
 Have gone — that is, by strengthening coordination among themselves, the strength of each force in the event of conflict will increase manifold
 aatanki karravaayiyon kaa jawaab dene ke liye ''sargical strix" ko sambhavit kadam ke rup main pesh kiya gaya he
 The document issued by Admiral Lamba is an improved version of the 2007 document on joint doctrine
 2007 ke dastavej ke kabhi logon ke saamne nahin laayaa gaya or aisa karke shaayad acha hi kiya gaya—nae dastavej kii sainya vishleshkon ne khaasi aalochana kii he
 Bharat Karnad, a research professor at the Center for Policy Research, called it "a very modest, level document of second-year college students"
 purv nausena pramukh or sioessi ke chairman admiral arun prakaash ne is sanyukt dastavej ko ''dardanivarak, majaak or vakt se pehle kaa" dastavej qaraar diya
 He said, "there is no such thing as integrated at the ground level, so there is no point in bringing such a theory
 harek sena apni-apni chijen kar rahi he
 "anit Mukherjee, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution India Center, says," Joint theory is hard to read, not just because its definitions, rules and concepts are confusing (and confusing), but also because it is worthless
 There is jargon and lack of thinking
 "aise siddhant kaa makasad sirf bharat ke sashastr balon kii mili-juli sainya karravaayiyon ko rasta dikhaanaa bhar nahin he, balki desh ke samrik bhagidaaron or virodhiyon ko apni manshaa, chunautiyon or khataron ke bare main bataanaa bhi he
 This is the criterion on which it does not fully meet
 aisa shaayad isliye he kyonki takreeban chaar saal se is par kaam karne ke baad bhi yah sanyukt siddhant rashtriya suraksha kii saaf-saaf paribhaashit ranneeti kii gaiyr-maujuudagi main viksit kiya gaya he
 For example, America's national security strategy from which its national military strategy derives
 isamen sena ke ranneetik lakshyon kii moti-moti baaten di gai hai
 The United American doctrine also derives from these military strategic objectives
 bharat ke mili-jule siddhant ke lekhakon ne vahi kiya jo rashtriya ranneeti ke abhaav main pichley, alag-alag senaaon ke siddhanton ke lekhakon ne kiya tha—unhone bhartiya samvidhan ke tarkon se unka pratipaadan kiya tha
 Lack of national strategic objectives is not the only concern to show the way to the army
 yah siddhant aise samay main saamne aayaa he jab aise kisi bhi sudhaar ko lagu nahin kiya gaya he jo ''ekikaran" par jor detaa
 Unified Command is essentially the ability of Army, Air Force and Navy to strengthen each other and work as a team

 The group envisaged a complete overhaul of the National Security Mechanism and a fresh formation of the Ministry of Defense (mod)
 yah kaam aazaadee ke baad se kiya hi nahin gaya tha
 The problem, however, is that the Chief of Defense Staff (CDS) is yet to be appointed, while 16 years have passed since the Group of Ministers' recommendation in 2001 to create such a post
 badtar yah ki kargil samiksha samiti kii report ke prakashit hone ke baad jaldi hi ekikaran kii disha main jo thode-bahut kadam uthaae gaye the, unhen bhi dhire-dhire palata ja rahaa he
 For example, the Navy re-occupied the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC) headquarters in Port Blair last year

 This was the command to serve the three armies that would repeat joint operations
 yah 2002 main banaai gai thi or isaki kaman baari-baari se sena, nausena or vaayu sena ke teen sitaron vaale adhikariyon ko di jaani thi
 The primary objective of this exercise was that all the top officers could get some experience in command of the three forces
 ab yah nausena ke haathon sanchalit kaman hi bani rahegi
 The Army has also decided that the newly proposed three commands for cyber, space and special forces operations will always work under the leadership of Navy, Air Force and Army officers
 is tarah kisi ek hi sena ke varchasv vaali kaman ke rujhaan ko sthaayee bana diya gaya he or mili-julepan ke taabut main aakhri keel thok di gai he
 Last year, China underwent its largest military reorganization since 1949
 raashtrapati shi jinping ke maatahat central military kamishan kaa vistaar karke 15 sanyukt kaamkaaji mahakme bana die
 The PLA has re-organized all its ground, air and naval assets into five "joint theater commands" of the peacekeepers, which will have personnel from all its forces to enable them to work together
 bharat ke saamne padane vaale lanzou or chengdu sainya kshetron ko bhang karke unki jagah ek hi pashchimi sainya kshetra banaaya gaya he jisaki vaayu or jamini sampattiyaan ek hai
 In the face of the disputed border with China, India has a total of seven different commands — four of the army and three of the air force
 yah koi tajjub kii baat nahin thi ki yah sudhaar rajnatik karypalika, khaas taur par raashtrapati jinping, ke nirdesh par kiya gaya tha
 All the examples of integration around the world have been improved in this manner

 As far as India's joint doctrine is concerned, the absence of Defense Minister Arun Jaitley at the April 26 launch probably highlighted the biggest flaw in the current joint doctrine of the armies: the lack of political vision

 It is believed that the Modi government is considering the appointment of India's first CDS

 Being the head of the Integrated Defense Staff (IDS) of the headquarters of the three armies, the CDS will promote integration in training and set priorities for procurement

 At that time the NDA-1 government also approved this proposal
 lekin sarkaar ko ise lagu karne kaa mauka nahin mila

 The published theory analyzes integration as saying how military integration is so important because of resource scarcity, and how it makes possible "centralized planning" and reasonable sharing of resources so that "the right time and right place" But the right combination of military forces "and" working together among all the regions "can be achieved

 BJP MP Varun Gandhi said on Friday that no allegation makes a person guilty and should not create an autocratic position on the basis of the article
 varuna gandhi bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke bete jai shah ke kaarobaar se jude ek lekh ke sandarbh main yah baat kah rahe the
 He said, my broad general opinion is that just because a person has written an article a person cannot be held guilty
 bina sakshya or bina uchit avasar diye
 Responding to a question from a student of Nalsar Law University that the government has accepted Jai Shah as a culprit without investigation, Gandhi said, "I am not defending anyone
" main kisi par hamalaa nahin kar rahaa hum or main kisi vyakti ke bare main nahin bol rahaa hum
 Varun Gandhi said, i believe that everyone has the right to present their case, if there is any discrepancy then it is a different matter
 lekin sirf isaliye ki ek vyakti ne kisi ke khilaaf ungali uthaai he is aadhaar par koi doshi nahin ban jaataa
 'need for new blood in political system' Apart from this, BJP MP emphasized on the need of new blood communication from non-political background in Indian political system
 saath hi varun gandhi ne sweekaar kiya ki unke upnaam se unke liye raajnneeti main kadam rakhana sambhav ho paaya tha
 He said that structural changes need to be made to ensure effective participation of young people from different social and economic backgrounds in public affairs
 varun gandhi ne kaha, ‘‘sabase mahatvapurn baat sansad ko niti kaa sthaan bananaa janaa chahie na ki raajnneeti ke liye ek sthal
 In our country for a long time, inclusive politics has been only about religion, region and caste
 ’’unhone kaha,‘‘ isliye sansad or raajnneeti main vibhinn awaajon kii hamen jarurat he
 We need labor activists, ngos, farmers, artisans and lawyers

 philhal bharat ke smartphone bazaar main iphone sirf 2 fisadi hi hai
 - America rules on the matter of pollution are strict, but if China and India, then companies here know how to make the waste discharged from the plant a dumping place

 nirmala sitaraman ko rakshaamantri bananaa is baar modi kaa aisa faisla rahaa jise jisane suna, wo hairaan rah gaya
 Even when Narendra Modi created his first cabinet in 2014, his decisions were startled
 smriti irani ko maanav sansaadhan mantralay saunpna aisa hi faisla tha
 Not only this, by bringing Suresh Prabhu of Shiv Sena to BJP, he was given an important portfolio like Railway Ministry, for which veteran ministers in every government are eager
 modi cabinet main rakshaamantri ke taur par manohar parrikar kii niyukti bhi ek chaunkaane vaala kadam thi

 There was a second expansion of the cabinet after two years of the Modi government
 modi ne is baar bhi aisa faisla liya ki sabhi kayaas dhare ke dhare rah gaye
 Surprisingly, Modi withdrew the Human Resource Ministry from Smriti Irani and handed him a less important ministry like the Ministry of Textiles
 prakaash jaavdekar kaa pramotion karke unhen cabinet mantri banaaya or maanav sansaadhan mantralay saunp diya gaya
 The third expansion of the cabinet took place on Sunday after three years of the Modi government

 puraa uttar bharat in dinon garmi kii chapet main he
 Everyone is suffering from the heat of the sun
 garmi se bachane ke liye tarah tarah ke upaay bhi kar rahe hai
 Women are taking umbrellas on the streets, while to quench thirst, people are resorting to beverages like mangoes and lassi
 sirf insaan hi nahin aag ugalate is suraj se bejubaan jaanavar bhi pareshaan hai
 They get their water only from the water, so where the water is seen, birds take bath in it
 bandar apni pyaas bujhane ke liye nal ke neeche baith jate hai to vahiin mor ped kii chhaanv main thandak lene kii koshish kar rahe hai
 When NDTV correspondent Ajay Singh from Varanasi came to take stock of the heat situation, he saw a peacock resting in the shade of the tree to escape the heat
 baahar garmi ke halaat aap aise bhi samaj sakate hai ki camere ke najadik jane ke baad bhi ye ped kii chhaanv chhodana nahin chahta
 To get cool from the heat, not only the peacock but also the myna (bird) also saw a little water on the ground, then taking a bath in it is trying hard to increase its body temperature
 bandaron kaa bhi yahi haal he
 To thaw, wherever you see the tap, open it and quench your thirst
 garmi se behaal manoj mishra kehete he ki garmi to bahut zyada bad gai he isse nijaat paane ke liye chane kaa sattu, neembu pani or lassi kaa seven kar rahe hai
 Not only this, where the Chahal initiative continues all the time, the ghats of Benares have also been emptied by their heat
 ganga kaa kinaaraa bhi logon ko thandak nahin de paa rahaa he
 Roads are also raining

 People in homes are suffering from this, so many have changed their routine

 Women are walking out with umbrellas and men are trying to avoid the heat by tying a skull on their heads
 pichley kai varshon se garmi main ijapha ho rahaa he
 Experts say that weather is the reason for this heat, but the biggest reason is the transformation of cities into concrete jungle, due to which the trees and plants are almost absent
 haalanki garm mausam main pareshaani to hoti he lekin har mausam ke apane phaayde bhi hote hai
 And every season is connected to each other, that is, more heat is expected to rain
 saath hi us mausam ke fal se lekar peya padaarth kaa majaa bhi apana hota he
 They have their own beverages of summer heat, in which people are seen quenching their thirst

 You can also understand the heat conditions outside that even after going close to the camera, it does not want to leave the shade of the tree

 The same condition of monkeys
 galaa tar karne ke liye jahaan kahin bhi nal najar aayaa use khol kar apni pyaas bujhane lage hai
 Distressed by the heat, Manoj Mishra says that the heat has increased too much, to get rid of this, gram sattu, lemonade and lassi are consumed
 yahi nahin jahaan har samay chahal pahal bani rahati he, un banaras ke ghaaton ko bhi suraj ne apni tapish se khaali kar diya he
 The banks of the Ganges are also not able to cool people
 sadakon par bhi aag baras rahi he
 The wave of this tapis looks as if there is water far away, but when going close there are only hot air slabs
 gharon main bhi log isse behaal he, lihaaja bahuton ne to apni dincharya ko badal diya he
 Housewife Vibha Kapoor says that the heat is getting so much that people are not able to do the necessary work of their home
 ham log apane zyaadaatar kaam subah hi kar rahe hai
 People do not leave the house in the afternoon
 tippaniyan Regardless of the weather, it cannot stop the pace of life, so people are leaving for work but with complete rescue

 Along with that, the fruits of that season have fun too

 The video was also tweeted by the Congress
 lekin video ke ant main jaise hi rahul kii nazar camere par jaati he vah halki-si smil karte hai or phirankhmaarthe hai
 Now this eye-catching story is once again becoming a topic of discussion on social media

 twitter
 com / cewtnqnafz— Congress (@incindia)september 17, 2018video main rahul gandhi lagaataar selfi lete nazar aa rahe hai
 In such a situation, people are writing on social media that Rahul Gandhi is creating employment in China

 u
 Q
 main saat pratishat vaale mantriyon ke PRO ji ko pranaam karo ! In Uttar Pradesh, the practice of keeping PRO / OSD at the choice of ministers is in full swing nowadays
 
 
 
 Secretariat service personnel are also posted PS or PA, who are state servants but ministers are not confident of them
 sthaayee karmchaaree koi gadabad karata he to uski ek acountbility hoti he or use saspend kiya ja saktaa he 
 
 
 
 lekin priwat vyakti yadi sarkari kaam kaaj dekhtaa he to na keval niyam va naitikta ke viruddh he apitu aniyamitata karne par uske viruddh koi karwaai bhi nahin kii ja sakati 
 
 
 
 
 There are many people who do not even have writing paper for appointment on paper, what will they do
 
 
 koi uttardaayitv nirdhaaran bhi nahin ho saktaa
 For example in the Department of Secondary Education, one particular minister in the board
 
 
 hai jinke yahaan mutual sthanantaran kii 400 patrawali rakhi hai or saudebaazi ho rahi he ki ru
 Give two lakhs and take the order
 
 
 haal he, tathakthith eemaandaar mantri ji ke vibhaag kaa
 Similarly, a Minister of Medical Education Department has some Kannaujia heads here and they see all the accounts above
 
 
 chah medical college khole ja rahe hai usamen nirmaan / architect ke liye saat kamishan kanaujia ji ne fix kiya he
 Similarly, in the Road Construction Department, offer seven percent to a PROG and get any contract
 
 
 
 This is a book of honesty
 is pradesh main kisi kii bhi sarkaar banavaa lo , haal yahi rahanaa he
 Almost all ministers have been robbed
 
 
 maine ganna vibhaag main chini vikray ghotaalaa maine purv main likhaa hi tha
 It looks as if there is a chance or not
 is sarkaar main mantriyon ke yahaan saat kaa ank bada lokapriy he 
 Do seven more commissions for any work
 jai ho 
 
 
 
 
 Of honest government
 koob looto or upar se eemaandaaree kaa dhindhora bhi pito 
 
 
 
 
 What kind of fun is happening in democracy? duusari sarkaron ko beyimaan bataa kar apane ko eemaandaar kaho kaam ho jayega
 
 
 
 ulta chor kotwaal ko daante
 Hey, other governments were dishonest then only they brought you
 
 
 
 And now you have also broken the records of corruption
 
 
 
 Where does the public go? 2019 ke chunaav main shaayad ye sab paisa kaam na aae 
 
 
 
 log bahut naaraaz hai 
 
 
 The public has the cure for the misconception

 Nobody is working for them honestly

 When the bjp-shiv Sena government was in the state, we had paid so much of the cost of sugarcane that the farmers did not need the movement
