 Agreeing with the Swaraj campaign's argument that the current declaration of drought is unscientific, archaic and arbitrary, the Supreme Court directed the central government to develop a standard framework for declaring drought and incorporate it into the drought management manual
 do
 is dhaanche main ghoshnaa ke maanak namakaran, samay or ikai, dhyaan main rakhane vaale kaarak, maap kii paddati or vibhinn karkon ke vajan ko shaamil kiya jaae

 upi chunaav main pichhadon kaa vot batorne ke liye bijepi main mayawati ke daagi purv mantri babu kushvaha ko aanan fanan main shaamil karaayaa gaya lekin jald hi party ko ehsaas ho gaya ki bispi ke keechad se camel khilne vaala nahin he
 If Advani was furious on the decision, now damage control is being tried
 bispi ke keechad main camel khilaane chali thi bijepi lekin apane hi ghar main lag gai aag
 Mayawati's tainted former minister Babu Singh Kushwaha was included in the BJP, but the party is currently in two camps
 sutron kii maane to bade bijepi netaa agbabula hai
 The inclusion of Kushwaha in the party has made him fear of tremendous loss in UP elections
 wo ashanka jaahir kar rahe hai ki rajya main hone vaale chunaavon main 'chauthe number par chali jaaegi bijepi, bijepi kii saakh ko laga jhatka, karbokartaaon main hai jabardast rosh
 At the same time, leaders who have sympathy with Babu Singh Kushwaha are working to compensate for the loss
 jab bade netaaon ne aagaah kiya to bijepi ne nuksaan bharpai kii koshish main or bhi netaaon ko utaar diya
 But will this clarification stop the questions raised in the bjp's statement? Opposition is busy trying to unravel the BJP

 But the question here is not just about political attacks or allegations
 sawaal ye bhi he ki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf desh main rathyatra nikaalane vaali bijepi kya chunaav aate hi aise rang badal legi? The Central Government has approved the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations

 The three Army departments have issued guidelines regarding this

 Let us tell you that the Union Cabinet had approved the changes in salary, allowances and pensions, and decided that the changes will be applicable from 1 January 2016

 The military forces were pressing for a return to the percentage-based system for disability pensions and were opposing the slab-based system recommended by the 7th Central Pay Commission
 ise bhi padhein: 7waan vetan ayog: cycle, dress or hair kating jaise bhatton par hua faislaarbiai kaa akalan he ki vetan ayog dwaara prastaavit daron par bhatte ko chaalu vitt varsh kii shuruyaat se maanya karne ke baad zyaadaatar rajya bhi apane karmchaariyon ko isi dar par bhatta dena shuru kar denge

 Both parties have given responsibility to three leaders for negotiating the alliance between bjp-shiv Sena

 Also, the ruling BJP in the state is adopting a similar attitude towards the Shiv Sena
 isi vajah seshiv sainik donon dalon kaa gathbandhan nahin chaahtehain
 The Shiv Sena also fears that the ruling BJP at the Center and in the state, excited by the victory in the recent civic elections, may not demand more seats in the BMC elections
 shivasena ke ek netaa ne yah tak kaha ki is baar uddhav thakare saaf kar chuke hai ki biemasi chunaavon main kam siton par chunaav nahin ladenge
 If the BJP has to form an alliance then some valid formula will work
 donon hi dal chaahate hai ki agar gathbandhan ho to chunaav se pehle ho jaae
 Also, Shiv Sena and BJP do not want to repeat the kalyan-dombivali incident in Mumbai
 ek sambhaavna ye bhi he ki donon dal alag-alag chunaav ladakar chunaav ke baad gathbandhan kar sakate hai

 Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said on Monday that match-fixing was at its peak during 1996, but he managed to prevent himself from falling prey to it
 samachar channel 'jeeyo news' ne akhtar ke hawaale se kaha, 'us samay pakistan cricket team ke dressing room kaa maahaul bahut vicitra hota tha
 Trust me the dressing room cannot have a worse atmosphere
 ' Known as some of the fastest bowlers in the world and nicknamed as 'rawalpindi Express', Akhtar said that he always kept the distance and advised others to play with dignity and seriousness while avoiding it
 akhtar ne daawa kiya ki 2010 ke dauraan unhone mohammad aamir ko bhi aise logon se milane-julne se bachane kii salaah di thi, jo match phixing ke liye khiladiyon ko laalach de sakate hai
 It is noteworthy that Aamir was found guilty of match fixing in the same year due to which he had to face a five-year ban
 aamir ne pichley varsh dobaaraa antarrashtriya cricket main vaapasi kar lee he
 Akhtar also said that he had recently intervened to end a dispute between former cricketer Javed Miandad and Shahid Afridi and asked the two former Pakistan captains to end the dispute through negotiations
 akhtar ne kaha, 'baatcheet ke jariye vivaad khatm karnaa sabase sambhavit tarika he
 i asked Afridi and Javed bhai to settle the matter among themselves instead of the court
 agar yah maamla adaalat main jaataa to bahut se naam ghasite jate
 ' unhone aage kaha, 'meri sabase badi chintaa bhi yahi thi

 ullekhneey he ki aamir usee varsh match phixing ke doshi paae gaye the jiske chalate unhen paanch varshon kaa pratibandh jhelana padaa

 On the question that Azam Khan has accused you of throwing dead bodies in the river Ganges in Unnao, you have been accused of this, Sakshi Maharaj replied, 'azam Khan is my friend

 Delhi BJP leader and former Union Minister Vijay Goel has accepted the challenge of Deputy CM Manish Sisodia over the debate on Delhi's education model
 vijay goyal ne dipti siem ne dibet kii taarikh or samay poocha he
 There is a ruckus between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Delhi
 ravivaar ko dilli ke upmukhyamantri manish sisodiya ne twit karte hue bijepi ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda or bijepi netaa vijay goyal ko dilli kii schuli shiksha par bahes kii chunauti di or kaha ki bijepi shasit rajyon ke ajukeshan model or AAP shasit dilli ke ajukeshan model par bahes ho jaani chahie
 Manish Sisodia had tweeted that BJP should choose the top 10 government schools of any state and i choose the top 10 government schools under Kejriwal education model
 main aapke skulon kaa daura karuunga or aap log hamaare yahaan ke skulon main aaen
 We then argue over what is the subject of ridicule and see what makes one cry
 sisodiya ne yah bayaan bijepi ke kaaryakari adhyaksh jepi nadda ke us bayaan ke jawaab main kaha tha jisamen unhone kaha tha ki aam aadmi party uphaas kaa vishay ban gai he
 In response to this tweet by Sisodia, Vijay Goyal retorted that he accepted the challenge
 vijay goyal ne sisodiya ko mustafabad skool chalane ko kaha or dibet kii taarikh poochi
 Vijay Goel alleged that crores of rupees of taxpayers are being wasted in propagating false claims of education reform, while the reality is that 5 lakh children of Delhi government schools have failed, out of which 4 lakh students have got any Not even admitted to government school
 vijay goyal ne kaha ki kyon sarkari skulon main dasvin kaksha kaa har teesraa chaatr fail ho rahaa he? naveen kaksha ke bhi 76,523 bachche pariksha main fail ho gaye
 In response to Manish Sisodia's challenge , Goyal asked 6 questions
 1
 When are you going with me in the Mustafabad school under the Kejriwal government? Please provide the date and time
 2
 Why have you limited your challenge to only 10 schools? This is because the condition of thousands of other schools is poor
 3
 Who will choose 10 schools of Delhi government, you or me? 4
 sisodiya ji, kyon dilli sarkaar ke skulon se paas hue chaatro ko dilli vishvavidhyalay main daakhila nahin miltaa he? kitne bacchon kaa daakhila miltaa he yahi bataa dijie
 5
 agar aapke shiksha sudhaar ke daawey sahi hai to har saal lakhon sarkari skulon ke bachche pariksha main kyon fail ho rahe hai?6
 Why doesn't the Delhi government abolish the post of principal in government schools? Out of 1028 government schools, 800 schools do not have any principals anyway, so the result of Delhi government schools is getting poor
 bijepi netaa vijay goyal ne kaha ki ek baar jab sisodiya mustafabad skool kaa daura kar lenge tab vah duusare 10 sarkari skulon ke naam bhi bataa denge jahaan chaatro ke liye moolbhoot suvidhaayen tak muhaiyaa nahin he

 Renowned actress Hema Malini described the alleged suicide of TV actress Pratyusha Banerjee as 'silly' and said that the world appreciates the strugglers, not the losers who take their lives
 ek april ko 'balika vadhoo' star apane ghar main mrit paayi gai thi or andeh he ki apnebwofriend rahul raaj sinhase rishton main tanaav ko lekar unhonekhudakushikar lee thi
 Hema Malini believes that any person should struggle with difficulties in their jingdi and not give up life after getting frustrated
 unhone twitor par likhaa, 'inamookhartapurna aatmahatyaonse kuch bhi hasil nahin hota
 Life is the gift of God to live and not to end

 Every human being should overcome all kinds of difficulties and achieve success and not succumb to pressure and end life with ease
 jindagi sangharsh karne waalon kii saraahna karata he naa ki haarane waalon kii
 He also criticized the media for the manner in which the alleged self-coverage of the actress was done
 All these senseless suicides which achieve nothg! Life is God's gift for us to live not for us to take at will
 We have no right to do that

 The world admires a fighter not a loser — Hema Malini (@dreamgirlhema) April 4, 2016 Just becomes food for the hungry media who chew on news like celebrity suicides until the next sensational news happens
 Thn it is forgotten— Hema Malini (@dreamgirlhema)april 4, 2016 TMC leader and West Bengal Transport Minister Madan Mitra, who was in the cbi's conspiracy in the Saradha scam, alleged that the investigating agency wants to put the name of CM Mamata Banerjee by putting pressure on him
 madan mitra ko CBI ne kiya giraftaarakadi suraksha ke bich adaalat main hajir hue madan mitra ne mangalvaar ko adaalat main kuch samay ke liye apni pairvi khud kii
 Mitra pleaded with the court that instead of handing him over to the CBI, he should be sent to jail or be granted bail
 CBI ko 19 disambar tak mili mitra kii hiraasatsharda ghotaale main giraftaar kiye gaye madan mitra ko sthaneey adaalat ne 19 disambar tak ke liye sibiai kii hiraasat main bhej diya
 Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate of Alipur court, Hardhan Banerjee sent Mitra to CBI custody
 adaalat ne unke aawaaj ke namoonon kii jaanch karne kii baat ko khaarij kar diya
 The investigating agency had demanded five days of custody for Mitra

 In such a situation, they need to be detained even further
 mitra kii jamaanat yachika kaa virodh karte hue unhone kaha ki sibiai ko kuch digital data mila he, jise kendriya forensik vigyaan lab bheja jayega, taaki exparts kii raay mil sake
 CBI investigating officer FB Karna told the court that the agency had received some digital data, which would be sent for verification
 unhone kaha ki mitra kii aawaaj ke namoonon ko bhi jaanch ke liye bheja jayega or sabooton se nae naamon or nae tathyon kaa khulaasa hoga

 ek aurat hone ke naate main kisi or mahila kaa naam jhuthe aaropon ke saath kharaab hote nahin dekhuungi
 "dia wrote," There is no truth in these reports

 We asked the media to show mercy and give us time in this difficult time

 It is most unfortunate to see the level of irresponsibility exercised

 As a woman i will not stand for another woman's name being used so irresponsibly to perpetuate a lie
 — Dia Mirza (@deespeak)august 2, 20193)there is absolutely no truth to the alleged reports and no third person is the reason for Sahil and i to part ways

 input- IANS Two days before the 1993 Mumbai blasts case, a special court in Tada convicted 6 accused, including gangster Abu Salem
 salem ko sajaa hone kaa ehsaas kaaphi pehle ho gaya tha
 That is why several months before the decision came, Don filed a petition in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and demanded his return to Portugal
 tioai kii khabar ke mutabik, salem ne janvari 2017 main ECHR main yah yachika daakhil kii thi
 Salem made both his presence in India and the trial illegal
 darasal salem jaanata he ki portugal kii court ne uske pratyrpan kii manjuuri is shart par di thi ki bharat main use maut kii sajaa nahin di jaaegi
 a 2014 extradition decision was rejected by a Lisbon court in 2014, a year before builder Pradeep Jain was convicted in the murder case
 portugal kii court main salem ne daleel di thi ki bharat main uske khilaaf aise maamalon main trial chal rahaa he, jisamen use maut kii sajaa ho sakati he
 Taking cognizance of the matter, the court said that the Portuguese government's return to Salem is the responsibility of the Portuguese government
 ek baar phir salem portugal ke khilaaf ECHR kii sharan main pahunchaa he
 Salem wants the ECHR to hear his petition and ensure his withdrawal from the Portuguese government
 saath hi uskaa makasad bharat main chal rahe uske khilaafatrialko rokna he
 Salem's lawyer Tariq Syed said that despite the cancellation of the extradition order and the decision in favor of Salem, there was no attempt to take him back to Portugal
 isi mudde ko ECHR main uthaaya gaya he
 For now, it will be important to see the Indian government's side in this matter

 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has said that Samajwadi Party has an objection to opening multi-brand retail sector for foreign direct investment (FDI) without resolving farmers-related issues

 Ramgopal Yadav said, FDI in retail will affect millions of families
 yadi sarkaar ise lagu bhi kar detii he, to bhi ham ise uttar pradesh main nahin aane denge
 Akhilesh said that when some multinational companies opened a fast food chain in the country, it was said at that time that potatoes produced by Indian farmers would get good buyers
 unhone kaha, lekin aisa nahin hua
 There are many such issues
 meri party or netaji (mulaayam singh) pehle se kah chuke hai ki jab tak kisaanon or chote dukandaaron ke hiton kaa sangrakshan nahin kiya jayega, ham epadiai kaa virodh karte rahenge

 All states want investment
 ham epadiai ke khilaaf nahin hai
 We want that if FDI comes in the retail sector, it should not harm poor farmers
 unhone kaha, hamen epadiai par aapatti nahin he
 FDI should come
 hamaari aapatti sirf is baat ko lekar he ki kisaanon ke muddon ko hal kiya jaae
 Our farmers and small shopkeepers should not be harmed

 akhilesh ne kaha ki khudara kshetra main epadiai bada mudda he
 There should be a discussion on whether FDI should come in the retail sector

 The central government took the decision to print 500 and 2000 rupee new notes by demonetizing old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees through demonetisation, to curb corruption, but now the corruption by an officer within the note printing press is surprising
 The matter has come to light
 ghatana madhya pradesh ke devas bank note press kii he
 Manohar Verma, deputy controller in the Dewas Bank Note Press, was arrested on Friday while stealing two bundles of new 200 rupee notes, after which this strange theft which had been going on for the last 8 months was revealed
 devas bank note ke is adhikari ko giraftaar karne ke baad siaisef ne jab offis main uske dustbin or loker se 26 lakh 9 hajaar 300 rupee ke nae note baraamad hue
 The officer's house was also searched
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki manohar verma sirf rejected note hi churaataa tha
 During the raid at Manohar Verma's house, 64 were hidden inside shoe boxes and cloth bags inside Divan
 5 lakh rupee ke nae note mili
 According to investigative officials, this officer used to steal only 200 and 500 rupees of denominated notes
 sabase rochak baat yah he ki adhikari riject kar die gaye noton kii chori karata tha
 Actually Manohar Verma was an officer of Supervisor level and was posted in the category where sorting of defective notes is done
 manohar verma note veriphication section kaa head he
 Since Manohar Verma was a high ranking officer, neither his locker was checked nor his office was searched
 isi kaa phayda uthaakar manohar verma kapadon or juute main chhipaakar noton kii chori karata tha
 The CISF has handed over Manohar Verma to the police and arrested them for stealing the note
 poochtacha main manohar verma ne note churaakar le jane kii baat sweekaar kar lee he
 He also told that he used to take notes while hiding in a jacket in winter
 ek din pehle hi siaisef ke ek jawan ko manohar verma ko dustbin main kuch phenkate hue shaq ho gaya
 Actually Manohar Verma kept a wooden box near Dustbin and he used to throw the pack of notes in the same box, keeping the security guards in view
 baad main mauka paakar vah noton kii gaddi ko kapadon or juute main chipa letaa or offis se bina checking ke surakshit nikal jaataa
 When the CISF jawan suspected Manohar Verma of repeatedly throwing something into the barstabin, he informed his higher officer
 adhikariyon ne manohar verma ko rangehathon pakadaney ke liye vahaan lage muwable sisitivi camere ko dustbin kii ore fiks kar diya
 Just the next day, on Friday, Manohar Verma was caught red-handed while throwing a pack of notes in a wooden box
 a post shared by Aamrapali (@aamrapali1101) on Sep 24, 2018 at 8:45pm PDT You can call it the loca of translation
 isaki vajah kaa bhi nahin pataa he
 But if you write the word 'maad ** the' in the translation tool on Facebook, then translating it as 'muslim'
 'maad**da' shabd bharat main ek bhaddi gaali ke taur par istemaal hota he
 But why such a mess is happening on big social media platforms like Facebook and why the Facebook team has not been able to catch this mess yet, it is surprising
 fasebuk aisi seva he jiskaa duniyabar main tarkeeban dedh arab log istemaal karte hai
 The disturbances regarding this word were first noticed by the India Today Group website 'dailyo'
 yah website vichaaron kaa manch he
 Tools such as facebooktranslate are used to learn and test data that they are perfectly fine
 haalanki isamen insaan kaa bhi haath hota he
 Facebook launched the translation feature in 2011, but did not reveal how it worked and how to correct it if it was a mistake
 saal 2012 main fasebuk kii ore se kaha gaya tha ki wo transleshan tul ke liye duniyabar ke walantirs kii madad letaa he
 a media report at the time said that more than one lakh users have installed Facebook translation application and more than 10,000 people helped Facebook translate English content into all European languages
 yah mumkin he ki fasebuk apni website par content kaa anuwaad karne ke liye ab bhi usee prakriya kaa istemaal kar rahaa ho
 And perhaps for this reason, translating 'mad ** the' into India, showing 'muslim'
 agar vaaki fasebuk anuwaad jaise gambhir kaam ke liye is tarah walantier kii madad leti he to yah vaaki hairaan karne vaali baat he
 Because Facebook is very serious about content
 agar koi yujar samvedansheel content post karata he to fasebuk aamtaur par use block yaa post ko delit kar detaa he
 Facebook has put filters at all levels for such content
 yah or bhi hairaani vaali baat he ki fasebuk is tarah ke anuwaad ko kaise ijaajat de saktaa he jahaan 'maad**da' kii tulana muslim se karata he
 We talked to Facebook on this issue and will update it when our response comes
 dilachasp he ki soshal media par is tarah kaa masalaa pehali baar saamne nahin aayaa he
 Earlier, universities like JNU and Hyderabad University have appeared after searching "anti-national" on Google map
 google ke sutron ne is bare main bataaya ki aisa isliye hua kyonki website kii duniya or media main aise shabdon kaa istemaal in vishvavidhyalayon se judaa hua tha

 It looks like the shame of Taslima Nasreen at first sight
 jaise ki vividh vyaktiyon or ghatnaon ko katha-sutara main pirokar ek saamaajik surveykshan taiyaar kar diya ho
 Gunah innocence looks like a story of a story from the storytelling of a story

 With the support of the BSP in the by-elections held in March 2018, the SP managed to beat the BJP
 aise main 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ek baar phir sapa-basapa gathbandhan or bijepi ke bich muqabla hone kii ummid he
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2014, Keshav Prasad Maurya was elected as a BJP candidate for the first time due to the Modi wave
 phulpur ke sansadeey itihaas main pehali baar is seat par camel khilaa tha
 But Keshav Maurya, who was MP from Phulpur after the 2017 assembly elections, became deputy CM of UP, which led to the by-elections

 Nehru's Legacy Phulpur Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru elected Phulpur parliamentary seat for his karmabhoomi for the first time since independence in the 1952 Lok Sabha elections and was elected as an MP from 1952, 1957 and 1962 consecutively

 Ram Manohar Lohia contested from Phulpur Lok Sabha seat in 1962 in front of him, but he could not win
 ab tak sirf do hi aise netaa hai jo is seat se hat-trick bana paae hai
 The first is Jawaharlal Nehru and second is Rampujan Patel, who was an MP from this seat in 1984, 1989 and 1991
 vijay lakshmi ne sanbhali viraasat1964 main nehru ke nidhan ke baad unki bahan vijay lakshmi pandit phulpur se utrin or jeet darj kar saansad baniin
 Vijay Lakshmi also defeated Janeshwar Mishra in 1967
 1969 main vijay lakshmi ke istife ke baad upachunaav main congress ne keshavdev malviya utre, jinhen socialist party ke janeshwar mishra maat dekar saansad bane
 The Congress fielded VP Singh in 1971 to regain this seat and he won and became an MP
 iske baad 1977 main apatkaal ke daur main ek baar congress ke haathon se ye seat khisak gai
 Lokdal candidate BD Singh from Phulpur won the election in 1980 and became an MP
 1984 main congress ne dobaaraa se rampujan patel ko maidan main utaara
 This time he won the victory, meeting the expectations of the Congress
 lekin iske baad wo janata dal main shaamil ho gaye or lagaataar teen baar chune gaye
 Many mps of Kurmi Samaj have been formed from the strong Garhulpur Lok Sabha seat of SP
 iske alaava phulpur seat par espi kaa bhi majboot janaadhar he
 This is the reason that in 1996 to 2004 and 2018, the Samajwadi Party candidates won from here
 1996 or jang bahadur patel (do baar) espi ke tikat par saansad rah chuke hai
 He won from Samajwadi Party in 1996 and 1998 from Phulpur
 1999 main sapa ne dharmraj patel ko tikat diya to unhone bhi jeet hasil kii
 After this, the SP nominated Atik Ahmed from Phulpur in the 2004 Lok Sabha election who won, but after this, Pandit Kapil Muni Karvariya was elected on the BSP ticket in 2009 elections and Keshav Prasad Maurya became BJP MP in 2014, but in 2018 In the by-election held in SP, the SP once captured

 The number of Muslim, Yadav and Kayastha voters is also around this
 lagbhag dedh lakh brahman or ek lakh se adhik anusuchit jati ke matadaata hai
 Lok Sabha has five assembly seats
 inamen phulpur, psoranv, fafamau, elahabaad uttari or elahabaad pashchimi seat shaamil hai

 The team, which made a big jump in international cricket since its 2015 World Cup debut, was not surprised if it managed to beat one or two big teams in the Afghanistan World Cup
 world cap main sabhi team ko ek-duusare se bhidana he or aise main koi bhi team use halke main nahin lenaa chaahegi
 In 2015, Afghanistan could win only one match, but at that time match winners like Rashid Khan were not in the team
 bhartiya captain viraat kohli ne bhi mana kii afghanistan kii team ne pichley chaar saal main kaaphi pragati kii he
 He said, 'if you look at the Afghanistan team of 2015, now the team has completely changed
 koi bhi team kisi ko bhi haraa sakati he
 The team now has experience and had beaten the West Indies twice in the ICC World Cup qualifiers, including the final
 vishwa cap kii taiyaariyon ke tahat afghanistan ne dakshin africa main abhyaas kiya or phir britain main scotland or ireland ke khilaaf vanade match khele
 The preparations of the team suffered a setback when Asghar Afghan, who had been captaining all three formats for a long time, was suddenly relieved of this responsibility, although he is in the ODI squad
 mohammad nabi or raashid khan jaise anbhavi khilaadiyon ne bhi vishwa cap se do maheene pehle captain badalane par sawaal uthaaya tha
 The selectors later convinced him
 gulabadin nib ko vanade team kaa captain banane se pehle coach phil simons ko bhi bharose main nahin liya gaya
 Naib, however, took a career-best six for 43 against Ireland, leading the team to victory by 126 runs
 tii-20 praaroop main afghanistan ko sabase khatarnaak tiimon main se ek mana jaataa he or team ne 50 overon ke praaroop main bhi jujharupan dikhaaya he
 His biggest strength is the spin trio of Rashid, Nabi and Mujib Zadaran, while the fast bowling duo of Hamid Hasan and Daulat Zadaran have also proved themselves
 gendbaajon kii tarah ballebaajon ne aatmavishvaas nahin dikhaaya he
 The central government has not yet released OP Singh even after 18 days
 yogi sarkaar ke ucch stareey cameti ne vartmaan main CISF ke diji pad par tainaat opi singh ko rajya ke nae police mukhiya ke taur par chunaa or baqayda unke naam kaa elaan bhi ho gaya, lekin 18 din guzar jane ke baad bhi ab tak centre sarkaar ne unhen pad se mukt nahin kiya he
 The Center has also not recommended sending Singh to the Uttar Pradesh cadre
 abhi bhi upi dijipi kaa pad khaali he, aise main yogi adityanath uttar pradesh ke dijipi ke nae naam kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 The post of DGP Kamup DGP has been vacant for the last 15 days and ADG Law and Order Anand Kumar is taking over as DGP
 sabase hairat kii baat he ki centre or rajya donon membijepiki hi sarkaar he, baavjood iske ek IPS adhikari ko waapas bhejne kaa faisla rukaa hua he
 It is common in the corridors of OP Singhsatta, close to Mulayam, that OP Singh does not like Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as OP Singh's proximity to Mulayam Singh Yadav is well known
 saath hi bispi unka virodh kar sakati he, kyonki mayawati ke saath hue guest house cond ke vakt wo lakhanu ke esaspi bhi the
 On what basis will CM Yogi choose the new DGP? The biggest question is that if CM Yogi Adityanath chooses a new DGP instead of OP, what will be his basis? Will another name emerge based on seniority? Or Yaayogi Adityanath will bring DGP of his choice
 kareebi sutron kii maane to yogi adityanath nae dijipi ko vakt dena chaahate hai taaki unase manamafik nattejey le sake
 Also, the DGP should be such that under whose leadership the 2019 election can also be removed
 aise main ikke-dukke naam hi hai jo yogi kii pasand ke ho sakate hai
 Except everything, the country was busy in elections
 bhojan pani ke intjaam se bhi dhyaan hat gaya
 Meanwhile, it is being known that emergency-like situations are being created in the country regarding water
 sarkari taur par abhi sirf maharashtra or gujarat ke bhayaavah halaat kii jaankaree he
 Although such reports are missing from the promotional media, but the media which is concerned with the public, is also predicting an outcry for water in the rest of the country
 wo to garib ilaakon kii haalat kaa pataa chalanaa aajkal band ho gaya he varanaa hakeekat yah he ki bundelkhand main pichley ek pakhwaade se halaat bad se badtar hote ja rahe hai
 Even if these conditions are not new in the country for four to five years, but it has not yet been estimated how much the crisis has become deeper this time in terms of intensity
 beshak is saal barish aane main koi chaar hafte bache hai
 Water projects cannot be built so soon
 na koi immergency yojana ban sakati he
 That is, it is certain that even after four months of rain this year, there is no way to avoid the problem of water scarcity
 yani tay he ki agle saal inhen dinon phir ham pani kii kami kaa ronaa ro rahe honge
 Exactly the same way wept continuously for the last few years
 puri baat kaa labboluab yah he ki jal prabandhan kaa masalaa aarthik vikaas ke maamle se kahin zyada bada he
 So big that in any case, the figures of economic development will be lost
 kisi bhi desh ko pani duusare deshon se udhaar bhi nahin miltaa
 That is why we have no choice but to arrange to keep as much water as we can from nature
 or das saal baad jab utana pani bhi kam padane lagegaa to pani ko ek baar istemaal karke use phir se saaf karke dobaaraa tibaara istemaal karne ke tareeke bhi abhi se sochakar rakh lene chahie
 Be aware, the issue of water is bigger than any threat to the nation

 aam aadmi party (aap) ke netaa manish sitaudiya ne aaj aarope lagaaya ki gujarat police unki jasusi kar rahi he
 The charge comes a day after Narendra Modi's brief detention of party leader Arvind Kejriwal in the state during his development 'review' visit
 gujarat ke chaar din ke daure par kejariwal ke saath gaye sitaudiya ne aarope lagaaya ki kal shaam unase mulaakaat karne vaale logon ko police pareshaan kar rahi he, poochtacha kar rahi he or dhamkee de rahi he
 He tweeted, Police in Gujarat state is spying on me
 gujarat main main jin logon se mil rahaa hum, police unhen pareshaan kar rahi he, poochtacha kar rahi he or dhamkee de rahi he
 Kejriwal had yesterday alleged that Modi is trying to disrupt his development 'review' tour of Gujarat
 dilli ke purv mukhyamantri kejariwal ko buudhvaar ko unke daure ke dauraan gujarat ke radhanpur police thane le jaaya gaya tha or phir aadha ghante baad unhen jane diya gaya tha
 AAP convenor Sukhdev Patel of Gujarat State claimed that Kejriwal was detained, while the police denied that he had merely 'informed' Kejriwal about the model code of conduct which announced the election schedule The latter came into effect however, with Kejriwal alleging that the police took action after getting 'orders from above'
 kejariwal ne kaha tha, hamen subah ke samay pataa chalaa ki sabhi jila police adhikshakon ko kisi bhi haalat main kejariwal ko rokane ke nirdesh die gaye hai
 Modi also sent some people with black flags
 hamen pataa tha ki ve is tarah kii harakat karenge

 Last week's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Ram Vilas Paswan's Bihar Bachao Yatra is the latest example of this episode
 rajya ke 36 jilon ke daure ke baad 14 april ko baba sahib dow
 His visit will be completed on the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Ambedkar
 is yatra ke dauraan nishane par mukhyamantri nitish kumaar hai
 His slogan is' Remove Nitish and save Bihar
 ’ paswan kaa kahana he, ''agle teen saal tak bihar main nitish kumaar kaa shashan rahaa to bacchon ke haathon main slate, copy or kitabon kii jagah sharaab kii bottlen hogin kyonki sarkaar gaanv-gaanv main sharaab kii dukaane khol rahi he
 a needle factory was also not established in the name of development
 manaregaa main 6,000 karod ru
 The muddle of the government reflects the way the government works
 ”paswan khaamiyon ko ginane ke saath hi algepi gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane par sabhi ko indira awaas, contract par behaal shikshakon ko sthaayee karne or beti ke janm lene par 25,000 ru
 We are also promising to submit
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 or bihar vidhansabha chunaav 2015 main hone hai
 This is Paswan's second visit in a year
 2012 main unhone sankalp yatra se bihar sarkaar kii khaamiyon ko ginaya tha
 Paswan is not the only person who is creating political heat in this cold weather
 bihar ke pramukh vipakshi dal argedy ke supremeo lalu prasad yadav bhi parivartan yatra par hai
 Looking forward to the return to power, Lalu Prasad is trying to mobilize the people in his favor
 purniya yatra ke kram main lalu ne logon se apil main kaha, ''mana mere shasankaal main kuch galtiyaan huin, lekin use maaf kar ek or mauka den
 Such a mistake will not be repeated
 ” lalu ke nishane par bhi nitish hai
 He says, "the purpose of my journey is to hurt the misrule of Nitish Kumar, who is boasting of good governance
" ” argedy kaa majboot janaadhar rahe alpsankhyakon kaa bharosa hasil karne ke liye lalu kehete hai, ''lalu sad-gal janaa pasand karegaa lekin sampradayik takaton se kabhi haath nahin milaayegaa
 i was the one who stopped Advani's chariot and sent him to jail
 ”algepi or argedy hi nahin, congress ke pradesh adhyaksh choudhary mehboob ali kaisar bhi vikaas yojanaon main gadabadi or vittiya aniyamittaaon ko lekar rajya sarkaar ke khilaaf pichley saal pole khol yatra par nikle the
 The journey has not been completed yet
 17 janvari se bhrashtachar or kushasan ke mudde ko lekar jedy (you) se alag or rajyasabha kii sadsyta se istipha dekar navnirmaan morcha banane vaale upendra kushvaha bhi jilon kii yatra par nikal pade hai
 On November 9 last year, CPI-ML national general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya organized the Parivartan rally
 apane virodhiyon kii yatraaon kii tulana main bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar yatraaon ke maamle main sabase aage hai
 He completed the Panch Yatras in the last seven years, while he has been on the Seva Yatra since November 2011, the first phase of which will be completed in January 2013 through tours of 11 districts
 ve maanate hai ki unki seva yatra upyogi or kargar sabit ho rahi he
 The sequel to the Adhikar Yatra, which began on September 19, 2012 to demand the status of a special state to Bihar, will be completed with a rally at Delhi's Ramlila Maidan on March 17 this year
 haalanki adhikaar yatra ke dauraan nitish kii sabhaaon main acchhee-khaasi bheed juty he
 Says Nitish, "the JD (U) campaign aims to mobilize public support for the grant of special state status to Bihar
" haalanki sushasan or vikaas dekh kuch logon kii chaati fatati rahati he
 "but the events of protests at Adhikar Rally have made Nitish think
 vahiin bijepi ne april main hunkaar raily yojit karne kii ghoshnaa kii he
 In October last year, BJP leader Uma Bharti traveled 470 km from Mirajapur outpost of Bhagalpur to Buxar during the Ganga Samagra Yatra during which she criticized the central government
 yatraaon kaa ateet netaaon ko apni ore khinch rahaa he
 For the first time, in february-march 2005, Nitish organized a Yatra Yatra against the then Governor Buta Singh's decision to dissolve the assembly and recommend President's rule
 november 2005 main endie kii jeet ne nitish ke haath moolmantra de diya
 He made the Yatra Yatra after the Vikas Yatra before the 2009 Lok Sabha elections and won 32 out of 40 seats
 disambar 2009 se pravaas yatra ke jariye graminon se samvaad kaayam kiya
 Vishwas traveled before the 2010 assembly elections while he is on a Seva Yatra after the NDA won 206 out of 243 seats
 yahi nahin, ve aman rath, nirbhay rath, jananaayak karpuri rath, kisaan rath, swaavlamban rath ko bhi ravaanaa kar chuke hai
 By the way, Lalu has been famous for rallies, who have done 13 Maharalis in a reign of 15 years
 lekin yatraaon kaa silsilaa nitish ne shuru kiya, jo ab virodhiyon ke liye bhi anukaraniya ban gaya he
 When Lalu first became Chief Minister in 1990, he organized Garib Maharala
 1997 main chaara ghotaale ke maamle main samarpan ke liye ranchi jane ke samay garib chetana rath yatra kii
 He organized the Tel Pilavan rally in Lathi on 30 April 2003 before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections
 is chunaav main argedy ne 24 siten jiti thi
 It is not that rallies and yatras have been easing every difficulty of the leaders
 lalu ne sitambar 2005 main garib chetana rath ke jariye sankalp yatra or aktubar 2007 main chetavanee raily kii, lekin unki mushkilen kam nahin huin
 Before the February 2005 election, Paswan's rally received immense support from the people, but due to poor performance on the issue of forming a government, he was marginalized in the election after eight months while he had taken out the brotherhood journey
 saamaajik kaaryakarta anna hajaare ne bhrashtachar khatm karne ke liye 30 janvari ko patna ke gandhi maidan se andolan shuru karne kaa faisla liya he
 However, travel connects the public and becomes a medium for change, people believe
 lekin yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki yatraaon kii ranbhumi ban chuke bihar rajya main netaaon kii jari yatraaen is manorath main kahaan tak safal ho paati hai
 Former JDU leader Sabir Ali's BJP has joined
 ye vahi sabir ali hai jo 2014 main jediu se nikaale jane ke baad bijepi main aae the or agle hi din bijepi se bhi unki sadsyta radd kar di gai thi
 He is inducted by the BJP just before the Bihar assembly elections
 vahajediu ke ahm muslim chehronmen rahe hai
 When Sabir Ali joined the BJP in 2014, it was strongly opposed by senior BJP leader and now Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi
 unhone twitor par likhaa tha ki ab daaud bhi jald hi bijepi jwine kar saktaa he
 Naqvi had tweeted and accused Sabir Ali of being a friend of terrorists
 jediu ke ahm muslim chehre sabir ali tab rashtriya str par charchaa main aae the, jab chunaav se pehle unhone bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi kii tarif kar di thi
 After this, JDU not only cut his election ticket from Shivhar, but also expelled him from the party
 nakvi ne kaha tha aatankiyon kaa dostiske baad hi vah bijepi main shaamil hue ormukhtaar abbaas nakvi se vivadoor tamaam kayaason ke bich agle din hi unki sadsyta radd kar di gai
 As the controversy escalated, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi withdrew his tweet about Sabir Ali, but still he stood by his statement
 unhone kaha tha ki maine sabir ali ke bare main jo kuch kaha, ab bhi us par kaayam hum, main ab bhi kah rahaa hum ki unhen party ne nikaal dena chahie
 He said i deleted my tweet because Dawood Ibrahim's name was in it
 maine baad main vichaar kiya ki mujhe daaud ke naam kaa istemaal nahin karnaa chahie tha
 After this, Sabir Ali filed a defamation case against Naqvi
 lekin kuch samay baadadonon netaaon main sulahaho gai or sabir ne cese waapas le liya

 com / etkzyajry8— Randeep Hooda (@randeephooda)august 16, 2018 While US President and Democrat candidate Barack Obama described indo-us relations as one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century, Republican candidate Mitt Romney made no mention of India in his foreign policy speech
 romany ne apane sambodhan main obama par duniya ko vaishvik netritv dene main vifal rahane kaa aarope lagaaya, jisaki ummid puraa vishwa, khaskar isroyal jaise pramukh sahyogi desh kar rahe hai
 He promised that if he wins, on the strength of the military and economic powers, he will restore the foreign policy of the time to bring America to the post-world War role
 varjeenia military institute main somvaar ko apane sambodhan main romany ne libya ke benghaji sthit america vaanijya duutavas par hamalaa or isamen america rajdoot christopher stevens tathaa teen anya ke maare jane sahit arab deshon main jari america virdohi pradarshan va hinsa kaa zikr karte hue inhen obama shashan kii videsh niti kii vifaltaa qaraar diya
 Romney said, "it is the responsibility of us and our President to use the great power of America to shape history, not leave the country to destiny
" durbhagyavash maujuuda raashtrapati kii nitiyaan vaishvik netritv ke hamaare behtareen udaahranon ke samaan nahin hai
 Romney, however, acknowledged the Obama administration's success in finding and killing Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan
 afghanistan ke bare main romany ne kaha ki vah is bare main suni-sunai baton ke aadhaar par niti nahin banaaenge, balki vah varsh 2014 ke aakhir tak safaltaapurvak afgaan suraksha balon ko vahaan kii jimmedaari saunp denge
 On Iran, he said he would carry forward the policies of the Obama administration
 romany kaa bhaashan samaapt hone ke baad white house ke pravaktaa je kaarne ne kaha ki unki nitiyaan bahut had tak vahi hai, jo obama kii hai
 Former Foreign Minister Madeleine Albright accused Romney of changing her mind

 Ayaputhammal, mother of AG Perarivalan, said in Vellore district, 'after a long legal battle and the latest developments, we are frustrated now
 ' unhone kaha, 'ham ab or jeena nahin chaahate
 i am planning to request the Central and State Government that we should be killed and i am going to do that kindly give death to my son
 'gauratlab he ki rajeev gandhi hatya maamle main saat doshi murugan, perarivalan, santan, jayakumar, rabart paayas, ravichandran or nalini pichley 20 saal se adhik samay se jail main kaid hai
 Perarivalan's mother recalled a former CBI officer's statement to the court saying that part of the convict's confession was removed
 unhone perarivalan kaa bayaan darj kiya tha
 Ayaputhammal said, 'my son was picked up by the police on the pretext of questioning in the case
 us vakt 19 saal kaa tha or ab vah 47 saal kaa he
 Her youth and significant time of her life were wasted
 ' unhone kaha ki yahaan tak ki congress adhyaksh rahul ne doshiyon ko maaf kar diya
 According to the prosecution case, Perarivalan had purchased two batteries, which were used to assassinate the former Prime Minister at an election rally in May 1991 at Shreperumbudur

 Indian batsman Virat Kohli, who has now hit three centuries on the tour of Australia, said on Sunday that he did not respect Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson after the third day of the third Test ended
 kohli ne yah baat tisare din din ke khel ke baad yojit press conference main kahi
 Significantly, on the third day of the third Test between India and Australia, the dispute between the players of both teams once again appeared on the field
 ghatnakram ke anusaar janson ne gend phenki or phir kohli dwaara khele jane ke baad daudte hue use khud hi pakadaa or kohli ko ran out karne ke makasad se gend ballebaaji chor kii ore phenk di
 However, the ball hit Virat instead of being put in the wickets
 iske baad donon khilaadiyon ke bich bahes shuru ho gai, jise ampire ne shant karaayaa
 a similar incident occurred on the first day, when Mohammad Sami bowled the ball in the same manner towards the batting Australian captain Steven Smith
 press conference main is ghatana ke sambandh main puche jane par viraat ne kaha, 'main janson dwaara is tarah meri ore gend phenkane se naaraaz ho gaya
 i told him that this is not a game
 agali baar se aap mere sharir ke bajaae viketon ko nishaanaa banane kii koshish karnaa
 i go to the field to play cricket and not to engage in any controversy
 aisa koi kaaran nahin he ki main aise insaan kii izzat karun jo khud meraa sammaan nahin karata
 ' iske saath hi kohli ne kaha ki australian khilaadiyon dwaara kiye jane vaale is tarah ke vyavhaar ke kaaran hi unhen or acha khilne kii prerana milti he
 According to Kohli, for the third day in a row, there was a lot of taunting from the Australian players and the players of the host team continued to tease them by calling them 'spoiled bastards'

 There was a lot of uproar in the Lok Sabha after BJP leader LK Advani questioning the legitimacy of the UPA-2 government and had to withdraw his words due to stiff opposition from the Congress
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke netritv main party sadasyon adwani kii tippanee ke liye unki kadi aalochana kii
 Later Advani said that he was referring to the trust vote of 2008, in which crores of rupees were spent to save the government
 adwani ne assam main hinsa par kaarysthgan prastaav par charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue kaha ki upie-2 nazaij he
 This has never happened in the history of India
 vot hasil karne ke liye karodon rupee kabhi nahin kharch kiye gaye
 Members of the ruling party reacted strongly to this
 iske baad hangaamaa tej ho gaya or upie adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bhi bich main uthakar kuch kehete hue suna gaya
 Later, Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde demanded Advani to withdraw his words
 joardaar hangaame ke bich loksabhaa adhyaksh mira kumaar sadasyon se shant rahane kii apil kii or unhone adwani se apane shabd waapas lene kaa aagrah kiya
 Sonia Gandhi also asked Advani to withdraw her statement, after which Advani announced his withdrawal
 sthiti ko saamaanya banane ke liye adhyaksh mira kumaar ne adwani se apni tippanee ko waapas lene ko kaha, jise unhone sweekaar kar liya
 In doing so, he clarified that his remarks were not about the UPA-2 government, but in the context of developments during the UPA-1 government's trust vote
 adwani ne prashnkaal ke baad lagbhag 12 baje assam kii haal kii jaateey hinsa kii ghatnaon par kaarysthgan prastaav par charchaa kii shuruyaat karte hue ukt tippanee kii thi
 Sushil Kumar Shinde, the new Leader of the House, raised a strong objection to Advani's remarks, saying that he is a senior leader and we respect him, but through his remarks, he has declared the entire election illegal, for all of us
 It is a matter of insult unhen apane shabdon ko waapas lenaa chahie
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal raised the question of the arrangement saying that only the subject on which the adjournment motion is given is allowed to be discussed, but Advani is raising the other matter
 sattapaksh or vipaksh ke sadasyon kii ore se kaaphi der se jari hangaame ke bich adhyaksh mira kumaar ne sadan kii kaarywahi 1 baje bhojanavkaash ke liye sthagit kar di
 On the very first day of the monsoon session of Parliament, the proceedings were adjourned till 12 noon due to uproar over the issue of Assam violence in the Lok Sabha and various issues in the Rajya Sabha by the opposition and members of the BSP supporting the government from outside
 isse pehle, pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha ki sarkaar sansad ke niyamon or paramparaon ke anusaar kisi bhi vishay par bahes karaane ke liye taiyaar he or saath hi ummid jataai ki vipaksh donon sadanon main sarkari kaamkaaj ko puraa karne main harsambhav sahyog degaa
 Speaking to reporters before entering the Parliament building, he said, "our government is ready to debate any issue in accordance with the rules and traditions of Parliament
" assam main jaateey hinsa ke maamle ko lekar bijepi kii ore se kaarysthgan prastaav laae ke bare main puche jane par singh ne kaha, ham sansad ko bahes kaa manch maanate hai
 He said that the decision of his statement about the violence in Assam will depend on what happens in Parliament
 singh ne kaha ki unhen ummid he ki sabhi dal monsoon satr ke dauraan donon sadanon ke kaamkaaj ko sahaj dhang se chalaane main sarkaar kaa sahyog karenge
 During this session, the government will introduce about 31 bills in Parliament, although the Lokpal bill is not yet in the list
 sarkaar ke ranneetikaron kii maane to select cameti se bill ke aane ke baad use rajyasabha main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from this, the opposition will also try to surround the government on alleged scams like spectrum, coal block allocation and aircel-maxis deal
 tamilnadu express train main lagi aag sahit pichley kuch dinon main badhati rail durghatnaon ke maamalon ko uthaakar sarkaar kii dukhati rag ko dabaane kaa bhi prayaas hoga
 The Ministry of Railways is with the Trinamool Congress led by Mamta Banerjee, which is an ally of the Congress
 is saal desh ke adhiktar hisse main monsoon kii kami kaa vishay bhi sansad main jor-shor se uthegaa
 The opposition alleges that drought has arisen due to no rain, but the government is not prepared to deal with it
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj ne kaha, desh bade aarthik sankat kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 We will demand a serious discussion in Parliament and an honest answer to the government on the downgrade of the Indian economy in the world, the devaluation of the rupee and the problems arising out of them
 sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki iske alaava khudara kshetra main pratyaksh videshi nivesh kii anumati die jane kii sarkaar kii manshaa ke bare main unki party spashtikaran chaahegi
 He demanded from the government that either he should discuss this issue or give assurance in the House that FDI in retail will not be allowed
 pranab mukherjee ke raashtrapati ban jane se loksabhaa main ab unki jagah susheel kumaar scindia sadan ke netaa ke rup main dikhenge
 Gurudas Dasgupta of CPM said, "our first priority in this session of Parliament will be to discuss the crisis of the economy, because the government is trying to cover this truth
" epadiai maamle main sarkaar par saaf rukh nahin apnaane kaa aarope lagaate hue unhone kaha, sansad sarkaar kii koi 'naachati gudiya' nahin he
 He should take the opposition's demands seriously
 upie ke ghatak dal trinmul congress ne bhi sarkaar ko chetavanee di ki vah epadiai or pension vidheyak jaisi jan-virdohi nitiyon ko aage badhaane se baj aae
 Opposition also strongly surrounds the government on topics such as Pune blast, Assam riots, rail accidents, power grid collapse, large number of pilgrims dying in Amarnath Yatra and violence at Maruti plant in the monsoon session lasting till 7 September Will try tippaniyan Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal said that 31 bills will be put up for consideration in the monsoon session, but there is still uncertainty over the Lokpal bill
 is satr ke liye soochibaddh mukhya vidheyakon main mahila aarakshan vidheyak, vaayada anubandhan vidheyak or visal bloir vidheyak shaamil hai
 The much-discussed Lokpal Bill, which has been pending for the last 42 years, is unlikely to be passed in this session
 bansal ne kaha ki is vidheyak kii abhi pravar samiti main samiksha puri nahin ho paane ke kaaran ise is satr ke liye abhi soochibaddh nahin kiya gaya he
 The bill has been approved by the Lok Sabha, but it is yet to be passed by the Rajya Sabha
 baad main adwani ne kaha ki vah 2008 ke vishwaas mat kii baat kar rahe the, jisamen sarkaar bachaane ke liye karodon rupee kharch kiye gaye the
 Advani started discussing the adjournment motion on violence in Assam and said that UPA-2 is illegitimate
 aisa bharat ke itihaas main kabhi nahin hua
 Crores of rupees were never spent to gain votes
 is par satta paksh ke sadasyon ne kadi pratikriya vyakt kii
 After this, the ruckus intensified and UPA President Sonia Gandhi was also heard getting up in the middle
