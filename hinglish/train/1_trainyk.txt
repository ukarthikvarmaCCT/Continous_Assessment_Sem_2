 
 hamaar katkut gaye
 Even after passing Inter and being eligible, my name goes to Cuttack
 mujhe to tab bhi koi shikawa nahin, magar unhen shikaayat he ki ve bhi laayak hai, unase jo in dinon khud ko laayak bataa rahe hai
 The protagonists of today's story - Nitish Kumar is the first and Narendra Modi has been declared worthy by the BJP
 nitish ne to abhi-abhi apni laayaki bajaai he, jabaki narendra modi to ek saal se apni laayaki kii gayaki pesh kar rahe hai
 Rahul Gandhi, Mamta Banerjee, Jayalalithaa, Mulayam, Mayawati
 inamen se koi khud kaa naam letaa he, to koi duusare kaa
 The second takes the name of the third
 anna kehete hai mamata, mamata kahati hai jaya
 Nirma's advertisement song remembered
 sabaki pasand kursi kii laalimaa
 The question here is about the seriousness of the claim, not the formality
 desh kaa netaa kaisaa ho aajkal yah naaraa public kam, netaa hi zyada lagaate hai
 They say slogan, be like me
 aakhir nitish kumaar ne betia main kyon kaha ki unka biodeta zyada bada he, modi ke biodeta se
 Without naming him, he was taunting Modi that we are all humble people, so we do not say much
 jitne log tahal rahe hai, unase tulana karke dekh lijie
 Are we any bad? Even if we have no claim in humility, but as many people are moving around, no one has the experience of Parliament, no one has the experience of the state
 yahaan to sansad kaa bhi tajurba he, rajya kaa bhi he or kaam kaa bhi he
 There is no experience to make things
 kya nitish kumaar ne narendra modi kii daavedaari ko koi gambhir chunauti di he yaa chutki bhar lee he
 This question was also raised about Rahul Gandhi that he has been just MP, not the experience of the government
 teen baar mukhyamantri rahanaa, kaise pradhanmantri kii paatrata kaa hakdaar nahin he
 Does being MP or Union Minister make any special difference
 rahul gandhi bhi netritv kaa idia de rahe hai
 He attacks his style without naming Narendra Modi at every rally
 ye unke hi shabd hai ki bhaiya aise stage main aakar koi bhi bol saktaa he, magar sunne ke liye sir ko jhukaane kii jarurat hoti he, apana jo igo hota he, ghanmud hota he jo sab main hota he thodaa thodaa, usko dabaane kii zarurat he kyonki jab tak netaa apane aap ko nahin dabaata or janata ke bich main nahin jaataa he, tab tak netaa koi badlaav nahin laa saktaa
 For this, Rahul sets up a fence shop like Pathshala, where in an enclosure there are sometimes tribals, sometimes rickshaws, sometimes fishermen
 chand buniyadi sawaalon ko puch kar koi netaa ban jaataa he kya? War training takes place before or during the war
 rahul ke samarthak kehete hai ki dilli main purvottar ke chaatr jab dharne par baithe the, to rahul unke bich gaye or modi ne unhen apane paas bulaakar baat kii
 Did not go between them
 magar jaraa sa tepe rivoind kiijie, to narendra modi bhi tamaam collejon main gaye
 Rahul started going to colleges before Modi, but he forgot the way to colleges in the election months
 modi ne google hangout kiya, kisaanon ko bulaakar baat kiya, kuch jagahon par sawaal-jawaab main bhi hissedari kii
 Rahul is not on Twitter, but does Narendra Modi fulfill all the terms of dialogue via Twitter? We have rarely seen him talking while answering
 kabhi kabhaar kisi kaa twit jarur aage badha dete hai
 All this, despite being somewhat natural, is a very expensive part of the marketing strategy
 kya rahul ek-do intervyuu dekar itane bade desh main samvaad karne vaale netaa kii chhavi hasil kar sakate hai? kya modi chunavi saal main bina intervyuu die desh bhar ke patrakaron ke sawaalon kaa saamana kiye samvaad priy netaa ho sakate hai? kya vaaki aapke liye yah sab matter karata he yaa aap ise matar ke dane kii tarah gatak kar bhul jate hai
 Narendra Modi has also emphasized a lot about his leadership in his speeches
 vah adwani kaal ke majboot netritv kii avadharana ko hi aage badhaate hue iskaa ek nayaa roopantaran pesh karte hai
 Underline leadership and intention in all his rallies
 ahmedabad main udyog jagat ke pratinidhiyon se bolte hue modi kehete hai ki leadership bahut matter karti he
 If the country gives us the responsibility then it will have to take responsibility even if it is good, if it is bad
 bhaagane se desh nahin chalata he
 People ask me why did you not run from Modi ji Patna rally? i said that Modi would not have been born if he had to run
 bam balast hote hai, bheed thi sab tha
 This is the responsibility in leadership
 ek or jagah par modi kehete hai ki great leader chahie yaa good leader chahie
 There is a lot of difference between the two
 mitron jo khud ke liye jeeta he jo khud ko bada banane kii koshish karata he hawa, agar usko bada bana bhi de tab jaakar vah great leader banataa he
 But he who lives for others, gives courage to others, empowers others to call himself, and when the world begins to consider him a leader, he is a good leader
 to desh kaa netaa kaisaa ho isi par he prime time
 
 
 In the assembly elections of five states, the Congress seems to be comforted only by Punjab
 rujhaanon ke mutabik party yahaan ek dashak ke baad satta main vaapasi karne ja rahi he

 The line drawings on every fourth page make this taste even thicker
 aaie, kuch aachman karen is par aage baat karne se pehle
 The beginning of the book is interesting
 balki puri hi kitaab main is gun ko banaae rakhaa gaya he
 Thanvi mentions his journey from Karachi to Moanjodaro via Ladakana

 Do not travel outside Karachi without armed guards

 Along with this, this continent, after which the lines have now been named from India Pakistan, keep mentioning the shared heritage of it
 masalan, sindh kaa itihaas shahbaaj kalandar or unki aradaas main gaai jane vaali qawwali ke bahaane
 Along with this, there is also a mention of the historical duality related to local geography
 yatra vrutant kii bhashaa kavita may he
 In short sentences plurality

 As soon as the author reaches the point, he comes in his uruz
 om na sirf tasalli se apni pehali sabhyataa ke avasheshon ko nihaar rahe hai, balki pathakon ko bhi apane varnan se sahyatri bana le rahe hai
 In the midst of all this there is talk about the things to be found in Muenjodaro
 yahaan hone vaali khudaai or unke kul jamaa nishkarshon par baat hoti he
 There is also a lot of light on the battle of history writing and the ideology that surrounds it
 har vivaran ke saath tasviren hai, rekhachitr kii shakal main, jo samajhane main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 How is it all
 is udhaaharan se samajhen
 It is true that the broken stairs of a courtyard do not take you anywhere now

 But standing on those unfinished rungs can be felt that you are standing on the roof of the world

 You must have noticed how philosophy comes in the middle of the description

 And also memorializes its existing roots in order to move between its destroyers

 In the course of the narration, the authors also hold their views on the historical disputes related to the Indus civilization, such as the reasons for its end, its relationship with Saraswati or its military form

 But without any thought, any description would seem lifeless
 in sabake bich om vartmaan ke gyaan kii raushnee main bhi sab vichaarte dekhte hai
 For example, he remembers George Orwell's dictum amidst all the ideological turmoil

 And the one who controls the present, the past will be controlled
 om ke mutabik, muanjodaron main mili zyaadaatar murtiyon kii ankhen yun hi andhamudi nahin hai
 The philosophy of yoga is hidden behind him
 lekhak ke shabdon main kahen to, aankh hone ke ahankaar kaa vilay kar ankhen moondana or bheetar kii aankh se khud ko or duniya ko dekhnaa
 To find meaning in silence across words
 do paanv se duniya naapane kii mahatvakanksha ke barakes palathi maar kar baithna or kaal kii duuri naapnaa
 The book is not very big
 magar isamen vah badppan kuta kuta kar bharaa he, jo hamaare purakhon ne hamen muhaiyaa karaayaa
 It must be read
 isse ham kuch behatar, kuch saral, kuch garimamay or kuch ahm se mukt hote hai
 One more thing
 kisi kii kitaab main bhala koi or bhoomika kyon likhata he
 Here, this trend has started appearing from scratch
 kisi bade yaa bikaoo aadmi se tippanee karvaa lo to kitaab kii bazaar main puch bad jaati he
 But Muenjodaro is a new experience in this matter too
 kitaab kii tarah krishnanath kii likhi hui bhoomika bhi samruddhi de jaati he
 At the beginning, Krishnath gives a sutra in connection with the whole scenario as if not a book
 vah likhte hai, aap kitaaben padhein
 Just don't look
 aaj-kal to padhate nahin, dekhte hai
 This thing is like a necessary shock to the sighting
 to meri salaah he ki aap bhi is kitaab ko padhein

 vaise maaya kii party ye kahkar palatwaar kah rahi he ki ‘aap apana ghar dekh lijie
 ' aisa lagane laga he ki baba barphani apane bhakton se ruuth gaye hai
 Baba Barfani has disappeared even before the Amarnath Yatra is over
 pavitra gupha main jis shivlinga kaa aakaar kai feet kaa hua karata tha, ab wo puri tarah pigal chuke hai
 The Amarnath Yatra started with great enthusiasm with har-har Mahadev's Jayghosh
 lekin, yatra shuru hone ke 18 din baad hi baba barphani antardhyaan hone lage hai
 Suddenly, the 14-feet Shivling melted and mysteriously shortened
 14 july ko baba barphani kaa aakaar mahaj kuch inch kaa hi rah gaya he
 According to beliefs, Amarnath is the abode of Sakshata Shiva and Parvati
 kehete hai lakhon bhakton ko darshan dene ke liye shiv or shakti kii maujuudagi se hi har saal yahaan apane aap barf kii murat main mahadev prakat hote hai
 Till now, Mahadev used to be imparted by giving prayers to the devotees for 55 days, but now, like Kedarnath, Amarnath has turned his face to the devotees
 vaise is baar yatra shuru hone ke pehle se hi baba barphani apane bhakton se ruthe hai
 On May 14, Baba Barfani was 16 feet in size, it dropped to 9 feet in a month and now it is just a few inches
 baba barphani ke antardhyaan hone se un shraddhaluon ko maayusi hogi jo abhi yatra ke liye aane vaale hai
 Why is Baba Barfani angry? Why the innocent bhandari got absorbed in the holy cave of Amarnath
 kyon kareeb do hafton main pigal gaya shivlinga
 This is a big question for those who believe in religion
 lekin vaigyanikon kii maane to is saal amarnath main pichley saalon ke mukaable zyada garmi padi he, jisaki vajah se barf kaa shivlinga pigal gaya
 The paths leading to the Amarnath cave of faith have started to appear dry and flat
 amuman is vakt in raaston par barf hi barf dikhaai padati thi, lekin is baar barf kaa nishaan bhi nahin he
 In this cave of faith, many devotees are expected to visit this time, in addition to devotees after the commencement of the yatra, a large number of security personnel are also present around the cave
 baari bheed kii vajah se amarnath gupha ke aasapaas kaa taapmaana or bahut bad gaya, haalanki shrin board ne daawa kiya tha ki pichley do teen saal main unhone kuch aise upaay kiye hai, jisase gupha taapmaana naa bade
 When Baba Barfani first appeared on 14 May 2013, the Shivling had a size of 16 feet
 or dhire-dhire wo puri tarah pigal gaya
 But this is not the first time that Baba Barfani has met his devotees for the first time, even before this has happened
 kab-kab antardhyaan hue hai baba barphani2013 main 16 feet se baba barphani 9 feet ke hi rah gaye hai
 In 2012, the size of Shivalinga was reduced from 22 feet to 14 feet
 2011 main 16 feet ke baba barphani ne darshan die the, jo mahaj 5 dinon main 4 feet tak pigal gaye the
 In 2010 the size of the Shivling of 12 feet was first melted to 6 feet, and later to 3 feet
 baba barphani ke antardhyaan hone se bhakt niraash28 june ko amarnath yatra shuru hai thi
 Lakhs of devotees went out to see Baba Barfani, but Mahadev left the Amarnath cave within two weeks, while the Amarnath Yatra will continue till August 21
 aise main bhakt hairaan hai ki ab wo pavitra gupha main ruthe nath ko kaise manaayenge
 So far, about two and a half lakh devotees have visited Barfani Baba, while three and a half lakh devotees can reach Amarnath
 har din hajaaron shraddhalu pavitra gupha main baba barphani ke darshan kar rahe hai, lekin pehali baar bhakt pavitra gupha main mahadev kii naaraazgi ko mahasoos kar rahe hai
 Devotees who returned after seeing darshan say that Mahadev is in a rage
 koi pehali baar amarnath kii yatra par aayaa he, to koi kai baar aa chukaa he
 Devotees are deeply saddened by the news of Baba Barfani being inactive
 unhen ab amarnath gupha main us shivlinga ke darshan nahin ho paaenge jis ke liye wo itani kathin yatra karke pahunchate hai
 The desire to go on Amarnath Yatra is once in the mind of every Shiva devotee, because the form of Mahadev sitting in the holy cave of Amarnath is nothing short of a miracle
 barphani baba kaa ye rup na keval apane aap prakruti banaati he, balki is dauraan isamen saakshaat mahadev aakar vaas karte hai
 It is said that water droplets drop over the Shivling present in the cave
 usee jal ke jamane se ye shivlinga banataa he
 It is believed that this water drips from Ramkund, which is just above the cave
 manyata ke mutabik poornima kii raat ko shivlinga apane puure aakaar main hota he or poornima ke baad jaise-jaise chand kaa aakaar ghatata jaataa he, vaise-vaise shivlinga kaa aakaar bhi ghatata jaataa he
 But Bhole Bhandari in Amarnath got so angry that Mahadev had already disappeared due to the heat falling on the mountains
 mausam vibhaag bhi maanata he ki shivlinga ke pighalane ke peeche achaanak badi garmi he
 People associated with religion believe that the sudden warming of the season is the anger of Mahadev
 pehle yatra shuru hote vakt barish ne bhakton ko roka tha or ab khud mahadev pavitra gupha chhod gaye, jiskaa malatab he ki abhi nath kii naaraazgi dur nahin hui he

 The secular and modern character of the judiciary in the early years of the formation of the new republic is automatically evident by its many historical decisions, as it did in 1953 to investigate the volatile situation in Punjab under the Punjab act-hoo, 1954 Court of Justice In case of inquiry proceedings
 punjab ke halaat ke peeche majahabi aadhaar par kaam karne vaali kuch siyaasi partiyaan thim, jaise majalis-e-ahraar or jamaat-e-islamic
 Their roots were present in the election of 1946 in which these parties opposed the Ahmadiyya Muslims for putting the Muslim League government in trouble
 in islamic partiyon ke nishane par muslim lig cabinet ke sadsy or tatkaaleen videsh mantri sar jafrulla khan the jo ahmadiya the
 The Court of Inquiry conducted its hearing in a very elaborate and comprehensive manner in which two judges Justices Munir and Justice Kayani interacted with Muslim scholars of almost every stream of Islam
 is jaanch report ke nishkarsh behad dilachasp hai: 1
 Mohammad Ali Jinnah envisaged making Pakistan a secular state
 2
 The concept of Islamic State is a marichika that is meaningless to chase
 3
 There is no universal definition of who a Muslim is, so it should not be the job of the state to decide logically
 4
 The discontent of Punjab was a result of the inflammatory politics done by the regional leaders to put the Muslim League government in trouble
 aaj is kism kii kisi nyaayik report kii kalpana bhi nahin kii ja sakati jab pakistan ne apni sthapana ke peeche vaicharik taur par islamic rajya kaa ek aakhyaan garh kar sthapit kar liya he or sanvaidhanik taur par usne ahmadiya musalamaanon ko gaiyr-musalmaan qaraar diya he
 Democracy in Pakistan was first dealt with in the Tamizuddin case (case PLD 1955 FC 240), by which the judiciary there actively tried to deal with it
 lekin maamla kuch aisa palata ki iske baad se is mulk main jamriyat lagaataar patan kii ore badhati chali gai
 Where this case turned, the point was technical
 1954 main pakistan ke governor general gulam mohammad ne samvidhan sabha bhang karke isaki jagah ek mantriparishad baitha di
 The Speaker of the Constituent Assembly Tamizuddin Khan filed a petition against this action under section 223A of the Government of India Act, 1935 in Sindh High Court
 darasal, pakistan kii vidhayika ne hycourt main rit ke liye dhara 223 e ko hi apanaaya tha, lekin is rit ke khilaaf fedral court main apil kii gai
 The Court, after examining the applicable constitutions in the British Empire and Commonwealth countries, ruled that since the writ of Governor General of Pakistan was not stamped on Section 223A, the writ is invalid in the High Court
 iske baad baluchistan main seemaant aparaadh niyaman kii vaidhata ke sandarbh main doso mukadmaa aata he (pieldi 1958 essi 553)
 It was challenged saying that it is something outside the jurisdiction of the 1956 Constitution and lays the ground for the principle of compulsory (which has since plagued the constitutional history of the country since then) 
 supreme court ne isi faisle ke raste chuni gai sarkaar ke general ayub khan dwaara takhtapalat ko vaid tehraaya tha or iskaa aadhaar bataaya tha kavlson kii kranti ke siddhant or nyaayik sakriyata ko, jisamen sarkaar ko badalane ke liye kranti ko vaid tarika bataaya gaya he
 General Ayub Khan believed that parliamentary democracy is not suitable for the people of Pakistan and that there should be President's rule in the country where the President of the Republic will be elected by a group of voters called "basic Democrats"
 basic demokrasi kii yah vyavastha darasal tatkaaleen saamanti vyavastha ko banaae rakhane kaa ek mukhauta thi kyonki basic democrate kaa chunaav gramin kshetron ke kaddavar logon main se kiya janaa tha jo aprihaary taur par yathasthiti kaa hi samarthan karte
 In 1962, Ayub Khan implemented this system but during the independence of Bangladesh in the volatile years between 1969 and 1971 this constitution and its provisions were buried
 ek baar phir pakistan main sansadeey loktantr kii bahaali ho gai
 The Dosso verdict was overturned in the case of Asma Jilani (litigation PLD 1972 SC 139) in which Kavlson's doctrine of revolution was held to be an illegal legal doctrine
 badakismati se yah faisla kuch hi din tik paaya kyonki general jiya ul haq dwaara julfikar ali bhutto kii chuni hui sarkaar ke takhtapalat ko ek baar phir anivaaryta ke siddhant ke raste nusrat bhutto maamle main (mukadmaa pieldi 1977 essi 657) vaid tehra diya gaya
 This theory was first cited in the case of a coup, but effectively it was a version of Kavlson's theory
 1979 main julfir ali bhutto kii nyaayik hatya kaa maamla khud nyaaypalika ke haathon main aa gaya
 General Zia ul Haq needed Islam to legitimize his rule, so a federal Sharia court was set up in 1980 through an ordinance issued by the President
 ise baad main samvidhan ke aathven sanshodhan ke rup main samvidhan main shaamil bhi kar liya gaya
 The Sharia court today is doing its work parallel to the judiciary which deals with matters related to the Sharia
 is santhaan ke manmarjee gathan ko chunauti dene kii anya sansthaanon kii naakaami ne pakistan main kanoon or sanvaidhanik taur par ek majahabi tantra kii sthapana kar daali he
 These fundamental changes in the character of the judiciary against the role of Islam in the state are reflected in two historical rulings that embarrassed us - the Qajalbash Waqf case (PLD 1990 SC 99) and the Zahiruddin case (1993 SCMR 1718)
 kajalbash vakf maamle main aae faisle ne islam ko aadhaar banaate hue bhoomi sudhaar ko gaiyr-kanoonee tehra diya to jahiruddin banaam rajya maamle main court ne sanvaidhanik taur par paribhaashit muslimon dwaara samvidhan main asweekrut gaiyr-muslimon yaa ahmadiyon ke khilaaf hinsa kiye jane ko vaid qaraar de diya

 For the next eight years, the judiciary continued to act as a military ruler's seal, but the picture changed when Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhary refused to resign despite pressure in 2007, after which the so-called "lawyers' movement" erupted
 chif justise choudhary ko 16 march, 2009 ko purv pradhanmantri yusuf raja gilaani kii loktantric tareeke se chuni gai sarkaar ne dobaaraa unke pad par behaal kiya or yaheen se kukhyat enarao maamle (pieldi 2010 essi 265) ko lekar pakistan kii nyaaypalika or karypalika ke bich taaja jang chhid gai
 The NRO case was related to the National Reconciliation Ordinance, 2007, which exempted some important people from earlier court cases, including President Asif Ali Zardari
 supreme court ne is adhyadesh ko radd kar diya or pakistan ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri ko aadesh diya ki ve jaradaari ke khilaaf ek purana maamla kholane kaa aagrah karte hue swiss bank adhikariyon ko patr likhen
 Gilani refused to do so, saying that such a step would violate the exemption granted to the President of the Republic under Article 248 (2) of the Constitution
 isi ke chalate 2012 main supreme court ne pradhanmantri kii neshnal assembly kii sadsyta khatm kar di or loktantric tareeke se chune gaye ek pradhanmantri ke khilaaf prabhavi taur par nyaayik takhtapalat kar daalaa
 The new Prime Minister Raja Parve
 ja ashraf bhi supreme court kaa aadesh maanane se ab tak inkaar karte rahe hai
 It will have to be seen whether they are able to survive the scandal of the Supreme Court in the coming days or they will also have to cover their bags in the coming days
 kuch apwaadon ko chhod den to pakistan kii nyaaypalika kul mila kar ek pratikriyaavaadi sanstha rahi he jiske paas naagarik adhikaron ke sangrakshan yaa protsaahan ke naam par dene ko koi misaal nahin he
 On the contrary, it has legitimized a military coup, sacked and hanged the Prime Ministers, buried religious freedom, hampered the redistribution of income and land and was at the forefront of the persecution of minorities in Pakistan
 is
 haal ke varshon main nyaaypalika kahin zyada aatmavishvaas se bhar gai he or isiilie pakistan main loktantr ke liye asli khatra banakar ubhari he
 It has raised apprehension that Pakistan is not moving towards that infamous Bangladeshi model which has been tried there and has even died

 jisaki ore se new york court main diwalia karrwai ke liye aavedan kiya gaya he
 Similarly Ajay Gandhi is the CEO / CFO of Firestar Diamond Inc
 gandhi or bhansaali, donon ne, euke sthit neerav modi limited ke company board se 9 march ko istife die
 Bankim Mehta's name was also listed as a director of the company until Allycock became the only director at Hong Kong-based Firestar Diamond
 in companiyon main se kisi ke sharholding strecchar main koi badlaav hua he yaa nahin ye tabhi pataa chal paaegaa jab inaki ore se vaarshik ritern daakhil kii jaaegi
 Ravi Bhushan, an independent Delhi-based company secretary, told India Today, "it looks like India's most wanted Jewelthief Nirav Modi is doing all this to secure his UK and Hong Kong properties
" kanoon pravartan agenciyon kii jaanch se bachane ke liye kaarobaaron kii ore se aam taur par isi tarah ke hatkande apanaae jate hai
 When Nirav Modi is fleeing to change his hideout, the choice of an American citizen to be the only director of three foreign companies raises doubts
 iske alaava companiyon main top management main badlaav ke liye jo vakt chunaa gaya he wo bhi sandigdh he kyonki firestar diamond ink pehle hi diwalia karrwai ke liye apil daakhil kar chuki he
 The sale hearing related to this appeal is set for April 15 in New York

 Raksha Bandhan 2018: Due to this Raksha Bandhan is celebrated every year, these are 5 stories related to Rakhi Raksha Bandhan 2018: Due to this Raksha Bandhan is celebrated every year, these are 5 stories related to Rakhi aparaadhiyon or gangster ke naam par sirf saal bhar main 1800 se zyada encounter kar 50 logon ko maar giraane vaali upi police kii banduukon ne ab achaanak apana nishaanaa badal liya he
 The mouth of the guns has now turned to the dogs
 darasal, utttar pradesh ke sitapur ilaake se khabar aa rahi thi ki vahaan kuch kute aadamkhor ho gaye hai or wo ilaake ke bacchon ko apana nishaanaa bana rahe hai
 In six months, 12 children had died
 bas isi ke baad upi police thik usee tarah gher-gher karkutton kaa encounterkar rahi he, jaise aparaadhiyon ke naam par insaanon kaa kar rahi he
 However, it is still not clear whether the children are hunting dogs or anyone else? The UP Police, one year, 1800 encounters are firing bullets in UP
 naa exias
 No lawsuit
 naa giraftaar
 No plea, no lawyer
 naa bahes
 Decide on the straight road
 saal bhar main 1800 encunter
 Over 50 stacks
 300 se zyada ghayal
 This is a matter of human encounter
 par ise kya kahenge? kyonki upi police vahi he
 Same guns
 golinaan bhi vahi
 Just the target has changed
 yahaan police kii goliyon ke nishane par apradhi nahin balki vafaadaar jaanavar kute hai
 a special team of police team was formed for the encounter
 jagah jagah chhapemari kii ja rahi he
 Drone cameras are being monitored
 doorabeen se har harakat kii khabar rakhi ja rahi he
 Hour-long encounters are going on
 aise kii ja rahi he 12 bacchon ke kaatilon kii talash
 In Khairabad, a special team of dog terrorists finally killed a member of the gang that killed 12 children in an encounter after the encounter
 ji haa, upi main badmaashon ke encounter ke baad ab kutton ke encounter kii zarurat isliye aa padi he kyonki police kaa maananaa he ki ye kute aadamkhor ho gaye hai
 Just because of this UP Police is running Operation Dog Encounter in the district considering these dogs as murderers of 12 children
 6 maah main 12 bachche bane shikarailazaam he ki november se lekar ab tak kareeb 6 maheenon main kute yahaan 12 maasoom bacchon ko apana shikaar bana chuke hai
 Out of which 6 children lost their lives in the first week of May only
 november main himanshi or sonam kutton kaa shikaar bane
 In January the dogs made Mubin their prey
 farvari main maasoom shagun kutton ke hamalon main maaraa gaya
 In March, Arbaaz and Sania were attacked with a fatal attack
 or may main ab tak shaavani, khalid, komal, gita, virendra or kasim ko kutton ne apana shikaar banaaya
 These incidents are very strange
 gali ke kutton kaa achaanak aadamkhor ho janaa hairaan karne vaala he
 That's why so many things are happening
 adhikariyon ke bayanon main virodhabhasasitapur ke espi kaa kahana he ki kutton ko gosht khaane ko nahin mil rahaa he isliye wo insaanon ko kaat rahe hai
 But the question is that slaughterhouses are closed all over UP
 to gusse main sirf sitapur ke hi kute kyon? or mana ki in kutton main khaanaa naa mil paane kaa gussa he
 Then why do they run away just by attacking the necks of children? Animal welfare officer Saurabh Gupta says that if those dogs have become man-eaters, then why have those dogs only bitten, not eaten? Wild man-eating predator dogs! It is not that street dogs cannot be man-eaters
 lekin aisa tabhi hota he jab wo dimagi santulan kho baithen
 But it is not possible that the flock of the herd go crazy together
 to sawaal ye he ki kahin aisa to nahin jinhen gaanv vaale kutta samaj rahe hai wo koi or he? kyonki hamalavar kute hi hai is bare main koi sahi-sahi nahin kah rahaa
 An eyewitness says she was like a dog but strange
 kuch gaanv waalon kaa kahana he ki jo kute bacchon par hamalaa kar rahe hai
 They are not outdoor street dogs, but outdoor hunting dogs hiding in fields and orchards
 jinaki bhaagane kii raftaar bhi zyaada he or ve bahut khoonkhaar hai
 Goats and cows were also made in all the villages within 10 km radius of Khairabad in Shisitapur, there has been terror
 gaanv waalon ke mutabik sirf bacchon ko hi nahin balki gaay or bakriyon ko bhi shikaar banaaya ja rahaa he
 Hundreds of goats and dozens of cows have been attacked deadly by these dogs
 ek adhikari kaa kahana he ki hamalavar kute nahin bhediye ho sakate hai
 Are the attack dogs or someone else? The fear is that the children have stopped going to school
 kisaanon ne kheton main janaa band kar diya he
 And those who are going are sitting on top of the loft
 par sawaal ye he ki kya hamalavar sachmuch main kute hi hai? yaa phir koi or? is aatank kii tah tak pahunchnaa zaruri he

 bijepi ne saal bhar main duusari badi siyaasi ladaai jeet lee he
 Uttar Pradesh elections were held in early 2017
 vahaan bijepi ne badi jeet hasil kii thi, iske baad gujarat main hue vidhansabha chunaav main bhi party phir se satta paa chuki he
 BJP has been in power in Gujarat for the sixth consecutive time
 haalanki, congress ne bhi dhamaakedaar pradarshan kiya he
 This is the reason that this BJP government will be the lowest in terms of seats
 aaie un 11 muddon par najar daalen, jo bijepi kii jeet main ahm kaaran bane
 1
 upi se zyada jor lagaaya2014 chunaav main narendra modi ne loksabhaa chunaav jeeta tha
 After this, for the first time, BJP worked so hard for a state
 aankadon par najar daalen to modi ke netritv main bijepi ne gujarat ke liye itane bade paimaane par prachaar kiya
 Modi tried to touch all 182 seats in Gujarat
 modi ne gujarat main 34 reliyaan kin
 Consider that in UP, Modi had done only 24 rallies
 2
 Modi Magic: The Gujarat election results once again proved that the Modi wave has not subsided in the country
 modi ne ek baar phir apane dam par chunaav prachaar kiya
 The entire election was fought by BJP in front of Modi's face
 jiesti-notebandi jaise kade faisle, gujarat ke kaarobaariyon kii naaraazgi ke baavjood modi ke naam par logon ne vot diya
 3
 gujarati asmita kaa daanvcongress ke tagade prachaar, patel andolan or logon kii naaraazgi dur karne ke liye modi ne gujarat asmita kaa daanv chalaa
 He consistently raised the respect of Gujarat in his rallies
 isse kahin na kahin sthaneey voter ek baar phir bijepi kii ore jhukaa
 4
 obisi ko na chhodana bijepi ke liye phydemandgujrat main patidaar andolan ke bich bijepi ne pichley do saal main zyada hadabadi nahin dikhaai
 Two years ago, despite the large-scale agitation and violence in Gujarat, the BJP did not listen to the Patidars directly
 anandiben patel ne bhi siem kaa pad choda par andolan ke kai maheenon baad
 It is said that there was great mathematics behind it
 bijepi patidaaron ke saath khadaa hokar obisi ko naaraaz nahin karnaa chaahati thi
 5
 ram mandir kaa zikrgujrat chunaav main bijepi phir se hindutv or ram mandir ke mudde kii ore lautati
 After the UP elections, BJP leaders consistently raised the issue of Ram Mandir
 isse kabhi hindutv kii prayogshaala rahe gujarat main party ko phayda hi mila
 Meanwhile, in the beginning of December, the hearing of the Ram temple case started again in the Supreme Court, where Congress leader and one of the counsel for the party in this case Kapil Sibal had given a statement - Ram temple case should be postponed till 2019
 bijepi iskaa phayda uthaanaa chaah rahi he
 Modi took it up in his rallies
 kaha- congress netaa nahin chaahate ki ram mandir bane
 6
 cheharaa viheen congrescongress kii ore se pehali baar 22 saal main rahul gandhi ne itnaa bada prachaar kiya
 There was also hope among the party workers
 par gujarat main congress ke paas koi cheharaa nahin he jise sthaneey log yaad rakh saken
 Hardik Patel was the face of the much talked about local level Congress leaders who were not contesting elections
 logon ko rahul gandhi par bharosa bhale hi hua par unhone siem ke taur par koi cheharaa nahin dikhaa jise aage rakhkar ve matdaan karen
 7
 gujarati banaam hindiis chunaav main gujarati banaam hindi bhi ek bada factor rahaa
 After 2014, PM Narendra Modi, who has given speeches in Hindi on most of the occasions in the country and abroad, chose Gujarati in Gujarat
 ve lagaataar apni reliyaan gujarati main karte rahe
 Not only did he give a speech in Gujarati but he also approached people in local dialects in areas like Kutch, Bharuch
 iskaa kahin na kahin phayda mila
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi did not know Gujarati, due to this he constantly kept trying to connect with people in Hindi
 8
 In the Patel vote, Centahadik Patel launched the Patidar agitation for reservation
 bade paimaane par yuva unke saath aae
 The Patel community turned largely against the BJP
 par chunaav se thik pehle bijepi ne kai maukon par patel andolan ke saath-saath hardik ko kamjor kiya
 Many of Hardik's close associates like Reshma Patel were included in the BJP by the BJP
 isse patel maton main send lagi
 BJP gave tickets to 52 Patidari faces out of 182
 9
 Modi's emotional cordbjp fiercely played the emotional card in Gujarat
 kareeb 13 saal tak siem pad kii kursi sanbhaalane vaale modi ne khud ko logon se jodne kii badi koshish kii
 He projects himself as a son of Gujarat
 kahin na kahin unhone logon ko siem rahete hue apane lagaav ko yaad karaayaa
 Tried to give the message that your son is PM in Delhi, and you should also support him in Gujarat
 10
 Amit Shah's management After the bjp's campaign and Modi's face, the biggest reason is that Amit Shah's management is understandable
 congress ke prachaar, satta virdohi lahar, vot pratishat main giravat ke baad bhi agar bijepi ko magic aankade se zyada siten mil raheen hai to iske peeche shah kaa booth management puri tarah se kargar rahaa he
 11
 congress ke paas sanghathan kaa abhaavgujrat main jo bijepi kii takat thi vahi congress kii sabase badi kamajori
 Apart from the party, the BJP had workers from organizations like RSS, who are known to be active till the booth level, whereas the Congress had only publicity
 rahul gandhi ke prachaar ko party ke kaaryakarta seat or booth level par le jane main kahin na kahin asafal rahe

 While in school and college, if you are fond of eating food by sneaking into the processions of unknown people, then Amitabh Bachchan can make his role model in this case
 bollywood ke mahanayakabhi apane college ke dinon main udhaar ke kapade pahan kar ‘baaraaton main get craishing’ karne ke shaukeen hua karte the
 Remembering his college days during the shooting of 'reservation', Amitabh wrote on his blog, 'on the set of the film we were remembering the days of college and university
 kaise hostal main, khaane ke laale hua karte the or hamaari jeben bhi aksar khaali rahati thim
 At that time, we figured out a wonderful way to eat good food
 ’unhone likhaa, ‘ham logon kii najar baaraaton par lagi rahati thi
 When the wedding procession took place, we used to borrow good clothes from somewhere and used to eat good food by 'gate crashing' in the procession
 ’ amitabh ne likhaa he ki vah or unke saathi khud ko ‘ladke waalon kii taraf se aae mehmaanon’ ke taur par prastut karte the kyonki vahi log hote hai, jinaki ‘sabase zyada khatirdaari’ hoti he
 According to Amitabh, 'it used to happen many times while staying at Sherwood College, when there was no money to buy tickets to go to Delhi
 aise main aap kya karenge
 "he has said," It used to be that you had to catch a moving train from Kathgodam, so that no one could catch you and you had to travel the whole way sitting at the door
 agar koi aisa tisi mili, jo aap par dayaa karke aapako andar aane de, tab to thik, nahin to vaise hi janaa padataa tha
 'according to Amitabh,' and if no such TC is found, then you had to run from one compartment to another or there was only one way left, and that was' hiding in the toilet
 ’ Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu on Monday amid controversy over the demolition of 500 slums in Shakurbasti area by the Railway Ministry
 baithak ko sakaaratmak bataate hue kejariwal ne kaha ki baatcheet main yah tay kiya gaya he ki aage se pehle logon kaa punarvaas kiya jayega or uske baad hi jhuggiyon ko todaa jayega
 After the meeting with the Railway Minister, Kejriwal said, 'our meeting has been positive
 hamane aapas main nirnay kiya he ki bagaiyr punarvaas ke ab todphod kii karrwai nahin kii jaaegi
 If they need land, Vodilli will give a list to the government, after which the government will first run a rehabilitation program
 jab jameen khaali ho jaaegi to ise railway ko de diya jayega
 "the child had died before the campaign", amidst the controversy over the demolition of the township, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu had said in the Lok Sabha on Monday how to vacate government land for public works
 He has invited Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to discuss the issue
 'atikaraman hataao abhiyaan' ke dauraan ek bachche kii maut ko lekar uthe vivaad ko khatm karne kaa prayaas karte hue rail mantri ne kaha police record ke mutabik, bacchee kii mrityu atikaraman hataao abhiyaan shuru hone se kaaphi pehle ho gai thi
 The Railway Minister was replying to the issue raised by Bhagwant Mann of the Aam Aadmi Party during the Zero Hour in the House

 World International Yoga Day will be celebrated on 21 June
 sanyukt raashtra kii mahasabha ne bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi ke is prastaav ko 90 dinon se bhi kam ke ricard samay main paas kar diya he
 177 members out of 193 have given their consent to celebrate World Yoga Day
 yoga ke prati is str par aam sahmati bataati he ki vishwa diwas banane se pehle hi yoga kitna vaishvik rup le chukaa he
 Earlier, when India made a proposal to celebrate non-violence day on Mahatma Gandhi's birthday, only 140 countries supported
 yoga ko pahchaan kii zarurat nahin he, na hi iskaa prasar vigyaapan se hua he, phir bhi is sukhad upabaldhi par bharat sahit duniya bhar main karodon log khush hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi also publicly expressed his happiness
 unka kahana he ki yoga main puure maanav samaaj ko ek saath laane kii kshamta he
 It is a very beautiful confluence of knowledge, action and devotion
 yoga bharat kaa purana brands ambesader he
 Not today, decades
 iske peeche un tamaam chote-bade yoga guruon kaa yogadan rahaa he, jinhone apni lagan or sadhana ke dam par ise prachaarit kiya or iske zariye lakhon logon ko swasthya laabh karaayaa
 The world inside yoga has also changed a lot
 aisa nahin he ki sadhana kaa paksh kamazor ho gaya he, lekin yoga angreji kaa yoga banakar ek packaging main bhi badal chukaa he
 In the name of yoga guru, many people are also taking political advantage
 phir bhi yoga gyaan bhi he or aaj kii zindagi ke hisaab se twarit samaadhaan bhi
 There will be no country where there is no yoga center established by a yoga guru
 soshal media par kai log is maukey par un logon ko ulaahna de rahe hai, jo dakshinpanthi raajnneeti kaa virodh karte hai
 How did it mean to oppose the politics of religious parochialism that that person would also be opposed to religion or yoga
 kisi ne likhaa ki ab secularavaadi kya karenge
 Actually these are people who do not want to see yoga outside the purview of any politically organized religion
 ve khud se hindu dharm ke naam par raajnneeti karne waalon kii sankeern maansiktaaon ke virodh main yoga kaa virodh jod dete hai
 Perhaps this step of the Prime Minister will allow yoga to come out of religion and narrow understanding towards it
 yoga ko lekar raajnneetik rup se yahaan bhrantiyaan bhi failaai jaati rahi hai
 This is all and will remain, but yoga has been adopted by people of every religion
 sanyukt arab emirate, iran, iraq, syria, afghanistan, bangladesh ne bharat ke is prastaav kaa samarthan kiya he
 Those who are questioning other people in the name of being a proponent of yoga on social media, should also look at the fact and say that yoga has a global quality that people can see beyond the prism of religion
 pehle bhi or ab to or bhi yoga dharm yaa kahen to math-mandir ke daayre se azaad hokar vaishvik rup se le chukaa he
 Yoga is a thought system
 aaj jis tarah se dharm kaa ek sangathit rup bana he or us sangathit rup kii pahchaan raajnneeti tareeke se hone lagi he, yoga isamen feet nahin baithta he
 Otherwise yoga is also full of rituals
 magar yah khud se saakshaatkaar kaa zariyaa he
 China, Russia, France, USA, England, Brazil, Cuba, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Nepal, Spain have also supported India's proposal
 bharat kii is kamyaabi ko dharm ke gaurav ke chashme se dekhne waalon ko is maukey par vaishvik udaartaa kaa pradarshan karnaa chahie
 It is not that India has achieved this first success in the United Nations
 isse pehle bharat kii pahal par sanyukt raashtra kii mahasabha 15 june, 2007 ko prastaav paas kar har saal 2 oktober ke din ko vishwa ahimsa diwas ke rup main manaane kaa faisla kiya tha
 While presenting this proposal, the then Minister of State for External Affairs Anand Sharma said that 140 countries have supported India's proposal
 isse sabit hota he ki mahatma gandhi kaa duniya bhar main kitna aadar he or unka darshan aaj bhi praasangik he
 Anand Sharma had said that non-violence is the greatest power of the world
 tab is kamyaabi ko bhi bharat kii badi kamyaabi ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha, jise ham aaj bhul chuke hai
 They have forgotten so much that Gandhi's killer starts calling them nationalists
 sanyukt raashtra ke diwason kii sankhya itani he ki shaayad hi kisi ko yaad rahe
 If you go to the United Nations website and count it, then this number becomes 121
 21 june ko manaaye jane vaala yoga diwas 121waan hai
 The highest World Days are celebrated in the months of March and June
 in donon maheenon main pandrah din to koi na koi diwas manata hi rahata he
 Similarly, there are 14 international days in April and October, 13 days in November, 13 days in November, 11 days in May and December
 sabase kam janvari main ek or uske baad farvari main 5 din hote hai
 Radio Day is observed on 13 February, and International Jazz Day on 30 April
 21 farvari ko maatrubhaasha diwas, to 23 april ko angreji diwas manaaya jaataa he
 World Poetry Day is celebrated on 21 March
 20 march ko antarrashtriya prasannataa diwas bhi manata he
 Among the diseases, international days are also known as malaria, cancer and tuberculosis
 18 july ko antarrashtriya nelson mandela diwas manaaya jaataa he
 The United Nations website showed that on this day, 67 minutes have to be given to someone else
 ummid he, aap iskaa aadha to karte hi honge
 India takes great pride in nuclear testing these days, but hardly any leader says that the United Nations celebrates anti-nuclear Testing Day on 29 August
 ham in diwason kii aupchaariktaaon ko samajhate hai
 Nevertheless, this success in the United Nations General Assembly in the name of yoga after Gandhi cannot be ignored
 121 diwason kii suchi main gandhi or yoga ko muskaraata dekh kise acha nahin lagegaa

 One is a veteran of comedy and the other is a stalwart of yoga
 ek taraf kapil sharma hai jinke saamne bade-bade sitare bhi sanbhalkar baat karte hai ki pataa nahin vah kis baat par unka majaak bana den to duusari taraf baba ramdev hai jinaki fitness kaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki haal hi main unhone ek olympic medalist ko bhi patkhni di thi

 BJP came out in defense of Akash
 Second, BJP leader has defended Akash Vijayvargiya
 bijepi netaa hitesh vaajapeyi bole ki video main jo dikh rahaa he us puure maamle kii tah main janaa jaruri he

 One day he again tells me a tune
 kahata he, 'ek nesan song banaate hai

 26 July 2015, room number 14011 of Kokilaben Hospital Andheri, around 11 am
 ye aadesh bhai or meri aakhri mulaakaat kaa vakt hoga, mujhe maaloom na tha
 Seeing me coming into the room, his neem faint broke
 ham hanse-muskuraae
 Had breakfast with
 dekhte hi dekhte kamare kii maayusi shaayari or mausiki kii mehfil main badal gai
 My heart was stuck on an old romantic ghazal
 manjilon par kahaan he najar aajkal,aap jo ho gaye humsafar aajkal
 
 
 Started drawing his lines
 jo aadesh bhai ko jaanate hai unhen pataa he ki jaise hi koi dhun, koi tarj unke jahan main aati thi wo fouran use apane mobile main record kar liya karte
 This time my mobile also got a chance to record this pattern
 bed par baithe-baith hi unhone ghazal kii dhun banaai or mobile main record kar lee
 The nurse was also astonished, said, 'the artist just gets art, no medicine is needed in the world
 koi maanegaa ki abhi thodi der pehle ye kaise besudh pade the?' aadesh bhai ke kalakaar kii dawa sachmuch unki kala hi thi
 There was music only
 ve jab tak jie usee ke sahare jie or ab aage bhi hamaari yaadon main apane sangeet ke sahare hi jinda rahenge
 And those lines also came up as their last lines and we all hum that too

 aaj parashuram jayanti (parshuram Jayanti) he
 Parshuram Jayanti is celebrated every year on the day of Akshaya Tritiya
 hindu manyataon ke anusaar parashuram koi or nahin balki bhagwaan vishnu ke chathe avatar hai
 There are many stories in mythology about Parasurama's anger
 kaha jaataa he ki ek baar parashuram (parshuram) ne krodh main aakar bhagwaan ganesh kaa ek daant tod diya tha
 Apart from this, there are many such incidents in which stories of Parashuram's wrath are found
 kaha jaataa he ki inke krodh se sabhi devi-devtaa bhaybheet rahaa karte the
 It is believed that Lord Parashurama, a symbol of might, was born in the yoga of six higher planets, so he became a brilliant, powerful and powerful man
 pratapi evam mata-pita bhakt parashuram ne jahaan pita kii ajna se mata kaa galaa kaat diya, vahiin pita se mata ko jivit karne kaa vardaan bhi maang liya
 In this way, the goal of Parashuram, who was obstinate, angry and fighting against injustice, was the human interest
 parashuram hi the, jinke ishaaron par nadiyon kii disha badal jaaya karti thi
 He destroyed the enemies of the Aryans with his force
 himalay ke uttari bhu-bhaag, afghanistan, iran, iraq, kashyap bhoomi or arab main jaakar shatruon kaa sanhaar kiya
 The same Persia, also known as Persia, was named after him
 unhone bhartiya samskruti ko aryan yani iran ke kashyap bhoomi kshetra or aryak yani iraq main nai pahchaan dilaai
 Significantly, Persian-speaking Persia is said to be a follower and ardent of Parashurama and is associated with Parashurama
 ab tak bhagwaan parashuram par jitne bhi sahitya prakashit hue hai, unase pataa chalata he ki mumbai se kanyakumari tak ke kshetron ko 8 konon main baantkar parashuram ne praant banaaya tha or isaki raksha kii pratigya bhi lee thi
 This pledge was called a mass struggle against the then unjust monarchy
 unhone raajaaon se trast brahmanon, vanavaasiyon or kisaanon arthath sabhi ko milakar ek sanghathan khadaa kiya, jisamen kai raajaaon sahyog mila
 Ayodhya, Mithila, Kashi, Kanyakubj, Kaner, Bing as well as Magadha and Vaishali in the eastern provinces were also included in the federation which was led by Lord Parashurama
 duusari ore, parashuram ne haihayon ke saath aaj ke sindh, maharashtra, gujarat, rajasthan, punjab, lahore, afghanistan, qandahar, iran or oxiana ke paar tak faile 21 rajyon ke raajaaon se yuddh kiya
 All the 21 tyrannical kings and their successors were destroyed by Parashurama, so that no one could raise his head again
 bhagwaan parashuram ko lekar ek aam dharna he ki ve kshatriyon ke kul kaa naash karne vaale the, jo puraa satya nahin he
 According to the mythology, Lord Parashurama is not only responsible for the complete destruction of a total of Haihaya dynasty of Kshatriyas, rather than being a lion of the 'kshatriya' varna

 ' gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi par nishaanaa saadhante kaa koi bhi mauka congress nahin chhodana chaahati
 That is why the Congress has taken the responsibility to enter Modi's stronghold and open his pole
 modi ko ab gujarat main hi gherne ke liye congress 'pole-khol' abhiyaan chalaaegi
 In the next three months, the Congress will surround Modi with different revelations and movements and it will prove that there are many things in Modi's good governance
 yahaan sabase bada sawaal ye he ki agar congress ko aisa hi karnaa tha to isamen itnaa vakt kyon lagaaya gaya
 While Modi is seen attacking the Congress by touring across the country, the Congress too is not in a mood to spare Modi
 congress ne ranneeti banaai he ki modi ko unke ghar main hi gheraa jaae
 After the meeting with Rahul Gandhi, the next three months program has been decided in Gujarat, in which the poll plans of Modi's development will be revealed
 congress bataaegi ki shiksha main gujarat kitna peeche he or teachers ke kai pad khaali hai
 Apart from this, the Congress will also tell what is the figure of child mortality in Modi's stronghold
 enarechaem main gujarat main kitni rakam kaa ghotaalaa hua he isaki bhi congress pole kholegi
 Along with the truth about the claims of Modi, who is full of development, the Congress will also cry on this
 gujarat se congress ke prabharee mahasachiv gurudas kaamat ne kaha, 'gujarat main hamane tay kiya he ki agle teen maheenon tak saare kaaryakarta sadakon par rahenge or modi sarkaar ke khilaaf andolan karenge
 Modi is not as big as he says
 'modi ke raaj main hue dangon or alpsankhyakon kii haalat par bhi congress gujarat sarkaar ko gheregi
 The Congress will tell the whole country that Modi is very communal
 ye congress kii us niti se bilkul ulat he, jo usne gujarat ke vidhansabha chunaav main apanaai thi
 There he did not attack Modi's communalism at all
 kangras ke pravaktaa raaj babbar ne kaha, 'modi darasal 1993 ke babari model or 2002 ke godhra model ko desh bhar main failaana chaahate hai, lekin ye nahin chalegaa
 Not only this, the Congress will also give two days training to ten Congressmen of every state to counter Modi's cyber war
 jiske liye modi kii tarj par hi bangalooru se iti export bulaae ja rahe hai
 Rahul himself will participate in this two-day training
 saaf he congress bhale na kahe use bhi 'namo'nia se dar lagane laga he
 The Congress government, which is on the backfoot in Gujarat, will surround Modi at his house, but the question is whether this attack should not be reversed, because Modi believes that if the names are bad, what will be the name
 1 may se 18 may ke bich petrol or deazal kii keemten do baar badhaai gayi hai
 Petrol 3 from 1st May

 yani 20 dinon main petrol 7

 about 12 percent costlier
 is dauraan dijal bhi 5 rupaya 8 paise yani kareeb 11 fisadi mahangaa hua jabaki sarkari aankade ke mutabik kachche tel ke daamon main is dauraan 2 fisadi se bhi kam kii badhotaree hui he
 Actually, this mismatch of prices between the international and domestic market has been going on for the last one year
 khaskar jab tel kii keemten girti raheen
 Crude oil price 108 on 26 May 2014
 05 dollar prati bairal thi jo 18 may 2015 ko ghatakar 64
 79 dollars per barrel
 yani pichley ek saal main kachche tel kii keemat kareeb 40 fisadi kam hui he
 But in this one year, the price of petrol has been cut by only seven percent
 26 may 2014 ko petrol kii keemat 71
 41 per liter while the price of petrol was 66 on 18 May 2015
 29 rupee prati litre ho gayi yani sirf 7 fisadi kii katautee
 The same trend is also seen in diesel prices
 26 may 2014 ko deazal kii keemat 56
 71 per liter while diesel price on May 18, 2015 was 52
 28 rupee prati litre ho gayi yani sirf 8 fisadi kii katautee
 The comments tel companiyon ne iske liye antarrashtriya bazaar main badi keemten or dollar ke mukaable kamjor pade rupee kaa hawala diya
 It is true that in this last one year, the rupee has weakened about 9% against the dollar
 haalanki ye bhi mahatvapurn he ki november 2014 se janvari 2015 ke bich bharat sarkaar ne petrol or deazal par excise duty main chaar baar badhotaree kii
 Because of this thousands of crores of rupees have been increased in the public exchequer, but it could not reach the common consumers as much benefit as the fall in oil prices in the international market
 darasal antarashtriya or gharelu bazaar ke bich keemton kaa ye bemail rishta beete ek saal se jari he
 Especially when oil prices kept falling
 26 may 2014 ko kachche tel kii keemat 108
 05 dollars per barrel which was reduced to 64 on 18 May 2015
 79 dollar prati bairal ho gayi
 That is, in the last one year, the price of crude oil has come down by about 40 percent
 lekin is ek saal main petrol kii keemat main sirf saat fisadi kii katautee kii gayi he
 Petrol price 71 on 26 May 2014
 41 rupee prati litre thi jabaki 18 may 2015 ko petrol kii keemat 66
 29 per liter, which means a reduction of only 7%
 yahi trend deazal kii keemton main bhi dikhataa he
 Diesel price 56 on 26 May 2014
 71 rupee prati litre thi jabaki 18 may 2015 ko deazal kii keemat 52
 28 per liter, which means a reduction of only 8%
 tippaniyan Oil companies cited rising prices in the international market and rupee depreciating against the dollar
 ye sahi he ki is pichley ek saal main dollar ke mukaable rupaya kareeb 9 fisadi kamazor hua he
 However, it is also important that from November 2014 to January 2015, the Indian government increased excise duty on petrol and diesel four times
 isaki vajah se sarkari khajaane main to hazaron karod rupee kaa izapha hua lekin aam upabhoktaaon tak antarrashtriya bazaar main tel kii keemton main giravat kaa jitna phayda pahunch saktaa tha wo nahin pahunchaa
 But in this one year, the price of petrol has been cut by only seven percent

 Shehla is accused of spreading confusion against the army
 shehla ne 18 agast ko kai twit kiye the, jisamen sena par kashmiriyon ke saath atyaachaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The allegations were termed false by the army
 iske baad dilli police kii special cell ne aaj shehla ke khilaaf deshadroh kaa mukadmaa darj kiya he
 a sedition case was filed against Kashmiri social activist Shehla Rashid on Friday for her statement about alleged human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir
 dilli police ke special cell ne kaha ki teen sitambar ko exiaar darj kii gai or shehla kii giraftaar kii maang karne vaale supreme court ke vakil alok shrivastav kii shikaayat par ek aapraadhik shikaayat ke tahat deshadroh kaa maamla darj kiya gaya he

 unke khilaaf supreme court ke vakil alakh alok shrivastav ne shikaayat darj karai thi
 In his serial tweet, Rashid claimed that the army was indiscriminately picking up people in the Valley, raiding homes and torturing people
 unhone daawa kiya tha ki ghati main sattarudh bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke agenda ko puraa karne ke liye maanavadhikaron kaa hanan kiya ja rahaa he
 People had reacted sharply to these allegations
 rashid ne haalanki kaha tha ki jab bhartiya sena jaanch gathit karegi to vah saboot dene ke liye taiyaar hai

 Talking about recent years, this whole case started on 6 December 1992 from the demolition of the disputed site of Ayodhya, where the structure of Babri Masjid was earlier
 is dhaanche ko 6 disambar 1992 ko gira diya gaya tha lekin iske pehle bhi yahaan do baar kanoon se khilwaad hua tha, jise khud supreme court ne mana he
 The 1934 riots and attacks on structure: The Supreme Court has said in its judgment, 'the disputed structure was severely damaged in the year 1934 due to communal riots
 lekin british sarkaar ke kharch par isaki marammat karai gai thi
 According to the court, fines and Hindus of Ayodhya who damaged the structure were also fined
 12 may 1934 ko musalamaanon ko masjid kii saaf-safai karne kii ijaajat di gai
 The documents of the PWD department of the British government of that time also mention the Ayodhya riots
 peedblyoody ke dastavejon main babari masjid par hue hamalon ke baad nuksaan kaa zikr he
 During the hearing in the Supreme Court on the Ayodhya case, the lawyer of the Muslim side, Zafaryab Jilani, also kept the report of the PWD which stated that the mosque was damaged in the communal riots of 1934
 us samay angrejon kaa shashan tha or peedblyoody vibhaag kaa kaam bhi angrej hi dekhte the
 He had repaired the walls and domes around the mosque

 On 23 December, the police had filed a lawsuit for placing the idols in the mosque, on the basis of which the mosque was attached and locked on 29 December 1949
 court ne tatkaaleen nagarpalika adhyaksh priy dutt ram ko imaarat kaa resiver niyukt kiya tha or unhen hi murtiyon kii puja aadi kii jimmedaari de di thi
 The Supreme Court has said, 'on the intervening night of December 22-23, 50-60 Hindus entered the inner dome of the mosque and placed the statues under the main dome of the Babri Masjid
 is ghatana ke bare main exiaar bhi darj kiya gaya tha
 The Nirmohi Arena failed to prove that there were idols before the incident
 '6 disambar 1992 ko kya hua tha30-31 oktober 1992 ko vishwa hindu parishad kii dharmasansad main karaseva kii ghoshnaa kii gai
 Subsequently, in November 1992, the then UP Chief Minister Kalyan Singh gave an affidavit in the court to protect the mosque
 6 disambar, 1992 kaa din is vivaad main aitihaasik din ke taur par yaad rakhaa jaataa he, is roj hajaaron kii sankhya main karsevakon ne ayodhya pahunchakar babari masjid dhaha diya

" jo log mujhe lambey samay se jaanate he, unhen meri baat par puraa bharosa he
 i am someone who always cares about what to do next
 unhone kaha, main kuch bhi manmutav ko yaad nahin rakhata
 There is no such thing inside me

 He was blamed for everything wrong in the IPL and BCCI, but Srinivasan said he was not impressed by it and took his time to improve his golf skills
 unhone kaha, jab se main cricket kii jimmedaari se hataa to mujhe golf khilne kaa samay mila
 BCCI and a lot of time goes into running its own business

 He said, i would not call it a difficult time

 logon kaa kahana he ki ilaake main pichley 4 maheene se yahi haal he
 Water is available here for 10 to 15 minutes in 24 hours and at that time the water comes so dirty that it cannot be used
 is sambandh main dilli sarkaar or jal board sabhi se baat karne ke baad bhi samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin hua
 People use bottled water, people say that we use bottled water to drink water and every household has to spend at least 700 to 2000 rupees for this
 sthaneey nivaasiyon kaa kahana he ki hamanekejarivalko vot isliye kiya tha kyonki unhone 700 litre har roj free pani dene kaa vaada kiya tha lekin hamen 70 litre bhi pani har roj mayssar nahin ho rahaa he

 It is not easy but not impossible
 abhi bhi isamen kaaphi pichde hai or is disha main kaam hona baaki he
 It is very important to know how much damage has been done and what should be removed

 Work is yet to be done in this direction

 The DRDO is once again in dispute as RK Gupta, the project director of the 'agni-5' missile program capable of carrying nuclear warheads, has been removed, after which he complained to the Ministry of Defense and accused him of being targeted

 Earlier too, many interlocutors were appointed to find a way to reconciliation in Kashmir, but this time Dineshwar Sharma's selection as a negotiator is special in many ways
 dineshwar sharma ko mili super powerupie-2 ke kaarykaal main kashmir main shanti ke liye teen sadasyon, patrkaar dilip padaganvkar, soochna ayukta mem ansaari or shikshavid radha kumaar ko vaartakar niyukt kiya gaya tha
 At that time, the home ministry used to decide a lot of things
 lekin is baar sharma ko vaartakar banane ke saath hi sarkaar ne unhen bahut sari shaktiyaan bhi saunpi hai
 Dineshwar Sharma, a 1979 batch Kerala cadre IPS, has a rich experience of Kashmir
 unki pehali tainaati kashmir main hi hui thi
 He is also considered close to NSA Ajit Doval
 enese yaa piem ko karenge reportsharma ko cabinet secretary kii rank pradaan kii gai he
 This means that they will also report directly to the National Security Advisor (NSA) or Prime Minister Narendra Modi, not to the Home Secretary
 grahamantri rajnath singh ne kal hi saaf kar diya tha ki dineshwar sharma ko puri swatantraaa di jaaegi ki ve kashmir main kisase, kab-kahaan or kaise baat karenge
 That is, the home ministry will not interfere in it
 koi samay-seemaa nahin, tasalli se karenge kamsarkaar is baar kashmir masale ko lekar kitni sanjeeda he, ise aise bhi samaj sakate hai ki dineshwar sharma ko report saunpane ke liye koi tay samay-seemaa nahin di gai he
 That is, when they are satisfied, then they will submit their report
 isse pehle tak jo bhi vaartakar niyukt hote the, unhen aisi swatantraaa nahin milti thi
 Three negotiators were appointed by the Home Minister p Chidambaram during the tenure of Padgaonkar committee-upa-ii formed in UPA-2
 isamen dilip padaganvkar, radha kumaar or mem ansaari the
 The report submitted by that committee was rejected by the Manmohan government
 samiti kii report par amal na karne kaa dard dilip padaganvkar ke ek intervyuu main bhi dikhaa
 He had said that the UPA had rejected that report
 vahiin duusari vaartakar radha kumaar kaa maananaa tha ki raajnneetik vaarta va kaaman minimum program apanaate hue dirghakaalik ranneeti se kashmir kii samasya kaa hal ho saktaa he
 The three members of the Dilip Padgaonkar Committee met all the stake holders related to the Kashmir case
 isliye khaarij ho gai padaganvkar cametipadganvkar cameti ne jo report taiyaar kii thi, usamen ghati main sena kii sankhya kam karne se lekar maanavadhikaar se jude muddon ko turant nipataane, hurriyat se baatcheet jaisi kai siforishein thim
 The Manmohan government did not implement these recommendations as they were not practical
 kai cametiyaan baniin, lekin sabhi asarhinakshmir main shanti ke liye isse pehle bhi kai cametiyon kagathan kiya ja chukaa he
 The KC Pant and NN Bohra Committee had also tried to find a way to maintain peace in Kashmir, but all these were ineffective
 padaganvkar cameti is myne main alag thi ki iske sadasyon ne apni report dilli main baithkar nahin, balki riyasat kaa daura kar, vahaan ke takreeban 700 pratinidhiyon se mulaakaat ke baad taiyaar kii thi
 Mehbooba said, the effect of Modi's talk, the Chief Minister of the state, Mehbooba Mufti is very excited about Dineshwar Sharma getting freedom to talk to all sides in Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki centre ke is rukh se saaf he ki baatcheet kii prakriya ek baar phir se tej hogi
 Mehbooba said that PM Modi had said on August 15, 'na goli se na abali, Kashmir's problem will be solved by hug'
 yah kadam usee baat kaa asar he
 Farooq then Alappa Pakistan's former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted that he was waiting for the talks to begin
 vahiin umr ke pita faruk abdulla ne purana raag alaapte hue kaha ki yah ek siyaasi samasya he
 Only by talking to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, this solution cannot be solved
 unhone pakistan ko bhi is baatcheet main shaamil karne kii baat kahi
 Congress said, Modi forgetting Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that why did the Modi government take this decision after three and a half years? He raised this question and said that finally the Modi government admitted its mistake
 vahiin pi chidambaram ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ke is faisle se saaf he ki unhone ab tak sakhti baratane vaali bhul sweekaar kar lee he
 All those who were not negotiating till now, have now agreed to negotiate with all the stakeholders
 vahiin bhaajapa mahasachiv ram madhav ne kaha ki sarkaar kaa yah faisla swaagat yogya he
 He made it clear that the government and the home ministry have been saying from the beginning that they are ready to negotiate with all sides for peace in Kashmir

 unhone media se kaha tha ki yahaan china kii gatividhiyaan hamaare saarvbhaum adhikaar ke tahat hai
 There is nothing like changing the status quo

 It is noteworthy that sex education has been an essential part of the school curriculum in Denmark since 1970 and porn has been included in many school courses
 haalanki denmark ke sabhi skulon main abhi ise shuru nahin kiya gaya he
 Earlier, Professor Groggard has told the Danish government broadcaster 'DR' that showing porn movies in class is better than sex education
 professor groguard ke anusaar, 'ab ham anusandhan ke jariye jaan chuke hai ki adhikansh kishor porn kaaphi kam umr se hi porn se parichit ho chuke hote hai
 This means that you will not show them porn for the first time in class
 'denmark duniya kaa pehla desh he, jisane 1967 main sabase pehle porn se pratibandh samaapt kar diya tha

 It is not easy to achieve the target of 360 runs even if the rules change, fielding restrictions and pitch
 ’ He said, 'I knew we could achieve the goal
 ek baar hamane 414 ran (rajkot 2009) banaae, lekin srilanka 411 ran banaakar use hasil karne ke kareeb pahunch gaya tha
 So i told the players not to focus on the goal and just play their game

" ’ On the performance of the bowlers, Dhoni said, 'we need to improve our bowling

The Bombay High Court dismissed the petition of a man seeking divorce because of his wife's weight gain
 court ne yah vyavastha di ki vivaah ke baad vajan badhanaa talaak kaa aadhaar nahin ban saktaa
 The reason for seeking the divorce was that the wife had hidden the matter of breast surgery before marriage to the husband, due to which she later gained a lot of weight
 pati ne shikaayat kii thi ki patni kii samasya kii vajah se vah vaivaahik jivan kaa anand nahin le saktaa
 In the petition, the husband alleged that the weight of the wife started increasing rapidly after marriage
 uskaa tark tha ki usne patni ko ilaaj karaane ke liye samajhaayaa lekin patni ne sahyog karne se manaa kar diya
 The court did not consider it to be the basis of the divorce
 He said that his wife often refused to do the housework and then he had to do it
 usne aarope lagaaya ki patni ne uski icchhaaen kabhi puri nahin kii or patni hone kaa daayitv nahin nibhaayaa
 However, the court said that the husband had accepted that their marriage had reached perfection
 nyaayamurti em es sonaak or e es oka kii peeth ne kaha ki uski (pati kii) shikaayat sirf yah thi ki uski patni kaa vajan adhik tha or yah baat talaak kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakati
 The meeting was conducted through marriage bureau
 The court also said that the husband's allegations reflect the normal ups and downs of the marital life that the wife was quarrelsome and stubborn
 adaalat ke anusaar, yah baat talaak kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakati
 After marriage, the couple moved to Pune
 rishton main tanaav ke baad pati ne parivaar adaalat main talaak ke liye aavedan diya
 The court turned down the application
 iske baad pati ne bombai ucch nyaayalay main aavedan diya jisane uski apil is aadhaar par khaarij kar di ki vajan main badhotaree talaak kaa aadhaar nahin ho sakati
 The husband said that he had met the wife through a marriage bureau in Solapur
 uske mutabik, patni ne form main yah khulaasa nahin kiya ki usne breast surgery karai thi
 The wife argued that there was no column in the form in which she could tell that she had undergone surgery
 usne kaha ki pati se yah baat chhipaane kaa uskaa iraadaa nahin tha
 She denied the husband's allegation that before marriage the husband had asked her if she had undergone any major surgery, and yet she did not mention the surgery
 patni ne adaalat ko bataaya ki uske parivaar ke logon ne uske pati ko surgery ke bare main vivaah se pehle bataa diya tha

 a day before the start of the ODI series against England, the captain of the Indian team in Pune, Virat Kohli, said that he does not see these matches as a 'trial'
 vah to ise is saal england main hone vaali champiens trophy kii asli taiyaari maan rahe hai or isliye har match ko nokout match kii tarah lenge
 Virat also did what he said
 pune main hue pehle vanade main jeet ke saath shuruyaat kii or phir katak main series bhi apane naam kar lee
 Now the turn is to sweep the series clean by winning the third and last ODI in Kolkata
 viraat ne test main apni captaini kaa kamaal dikhaane ke baad ab vanade captaini main bhi jeet se shuruyaat kii he, lekin kya vaaki main champiens trophy ke liye champion team kii taiyaari bilkul sahi chal rahi he? yuvaraj kii vaapisi, mahendra singh dhoni kaa form or kedaar jadhav kaa bade stage par bade kaleje vaali pari, viraat ne sirf do maichon main hi bahut kuch paa liya he
 But, there are some things that are troubling Virat, she is being challenged to take big decisions
 england par lutaai meharbaan bhartiya gendbaajpune vanade main 350 or katak vanade main 366 ran kaa score
 Just think, Indian bowlers have scored a total of 716 runs in these two matches
 ab yaa to bhartiya team kii kismat bahut acchhee he yaa phir england kii bahut kharaab
 So far Jaspreet Bumrah has scored 160 runs in two matches, r Ashwin 128 runs in two matches, Bhuvneshwar Kumar has scored 63 runs in one match, Ravindra Jadeja has scored 95 runs in 2 matches and Umesh Yadav has scored 63 runs in one match
 ab bhala koun sa captain aisi gendbaazi dekhakar apana sir nahin pakadega?kya match jitaana sirf ballebaajon kaa kaam?yahaan, ghar par to phir bhi itane ran lutaaney ke bawajud jeet mil rahi he, lekin champiens trophy main kya hoga? thik he, england main condishans alag honge, lekin vanade cricket main to vahaan bhi gendbaajon kii kaaphi dhunaai hoti he
 Now Virat does not have much time to find the right combination
 anil kumble jaisaa ek bada gendbaaz team kaa coach he or dua kijiye kii wo jald hi in gendbaajon ko line par le aaen
 Otherwise it is going to be bad in England too
 shikhar ke aankade hai kamazor, lagaana hoga puraa jorpune main ek ran or katak main 11 ran
 The batsman who once scored 111 runs in one match, has been able to score only 12 runs in two matches
 shikhar dhawan match vinar hanye sab jaanate hai, lekin agar vah 10 match baad ek jeet dilaayenge to phir uskaa kya phayda? gabbar kii dahaad gaayab he or captain viraat soch rahe hai ki kolkata main unhen plaing-11 main daalen yaa phir baahar bithaaen
 It is not only the pinnacle, but also the watch for Virat

 Under his leadership, while there has been a steep decline in the income of Indian Railways, there has been a tremendous increase in expenditure

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia are upset because Banerjee does not take any advice from them
 is maheene kii shuruyaat main manmohan singh or pranab mukherjee ke saath baithak main mamata ne in donon se rail kiraaya badhaane ke liye jor na dene ko kaha
 He hopes this will be his last railway budget
 ise ve puri tarah apane man se bananaa chaahati hai
 Banerjee knows that this is also her last chance to woo the voters of West Bengal
 isliye unka yah rail bajet bhi loklubhaavan ghoshnaaon se bharaa hoga, yani unke grih rajya ke liye or nai rail line or nai railgadiyaan
 The Planning Commission has asked Indian Railways to reduce losses in passenger operations, which currently stand at Rs 14,000 crore
 salanaa he
 While this deficit has been mitigated somewhat by the increase in freight charges, the income from freight has also gone up to Rs 700 crore
 kii giravat ai he
 Railways do not have enough money to improve the level of their assets or improve passenger amenities by spending money from its two important funds — the Capital Fund and the Development Fund
 pichley saal railway apane capital fund main ek rupaya bhi nahin daal paaya, jo is sanstha kii durdasha kaa saboot he
 Despite this, Banerjee has spent Rs 11,000 crore
 kii laagat sekolkata metro networkke punaruddhar kii ghoshnaa kii he
 For the first time in the history of Railways, the arrears of suppliers have not been paid
 railway board ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai, ''pichley saal haalat itani kharaab thi ki bajet ke baad tak thekedaaron kaa paisa roak kar rakhaa gaya, taaki railway kii gulabi tasviir dikhaai ja sake
 "this year, suppliers supplying essential equipment such as cables used for signaling and fish plates have not been paid
" kai sapliron ne is par shikaayat kii he ki ve bhi udyog chalaate hai or unhen bhi balance shit taiyaar kerani padati he
 The Railway Board has asked all 16 zones to send full details of their liability
 bajet or vitt vibhaag se jude adhikari is koshish main hai ki railway kii badtar vittiya haalat ko saarvajanik hone se kaise bachaaya jaae
 Here too, they are under pressure because they are working without a head
 darasal, saumya raghavan ke chah maheene pehle ritair hone ke baad se rail mantri ne nae vitt ayukta (epasi) kii niyukti hi nahin kii he
 Additional member Samar Jha, the official elected by Banerjee, is overseeing the budget preparations
 rail mantralay ke ek adhikari spasht karte hai, ''unhone vitt ayukta ke bagaiyr hi bajet kaa kaam puraa karne kaa faisla kiya
 It is the finance commissioner who questions on unnecessary expenses and projects, and Didi is not in the mood to face any question or inquiry about this railway budget
 ''raghavan ne march 2010 main kaha tha, ''agar zyada kharch or kam aay kaa silsilaa barkaraar rahaa, to na sirf andruniund jutanaa kathin ho jayega, balki labhaansh bhugtan kii jimmedaari main vifal ho jane kaa bada khatra bhi paidaa ho jayega
 He also said that the fund balance has been fully utilized, so there is no money left to meet the internal goals
 raghavan ke mutabik, ''kharchon par lagaam lagaae or lagaataar apni aay badaye bagaiyr is sanghathan ke liye apana astitv bachaae rakhana mushkil hoga
 "apart from the Finance Commissioner, Railways has been running without member (traffic) for more than a year
 sadsy (yatayaat) railway kaa sabase mahatvapurn adhikari hota he, jo niti taiyaar karne or yatri or maal parichaalan ke prabandhan ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 At a time when the railways are failing to increase their income from passenger and freight traffic, the importance of this post cannot be ignored
 railway kii ek or agrani pariyojna- dedicated fret coridor (diefasi)- bhi patari se utarane ko he
 Manmohan Singh laid the foundation stone of the project in 2006, but it could not progress beyond that
 apane pichley bajet bhaashan main banerjee ne is pariyojna ko taiyaar karne ke liye jimmedaar diefasi corporation kaa punargathan kar ise patari par laane kaa vaada kiya tha
 But nothing happened in this direction
 hakeekat to yah he ki paanch maah pehle prabandh nideshak ke pad se ve
 K
 kaul ko hataane ke baad se yah pad khaali hi he
 Similarly, Indian Railways Technical and Economic Services has also been working without a managing director for the last three months
 ek anya adhikari ne kaha, ''mantralay ke rosemara ke kaamkaaj main banerjee kii koi dilchaspee nahin he
 Along with her indifference, there is a delay in taking important decisions as she seldom comes to Rail Bhavan and is running her work from Kolkata itself
 sari filein kolkata bhejni padi hai
 Since they are important files, many times senior officials of the Ministry including the Chairman of the Railway Board have to go to Kolkata with the files themselves
 jahaan tak rail bhawan kii baat he, to ve uske liye apravasi rail mantri hai
 At the time of the last budget, Mukherjee objected to some of the projects proposed by Banerjee, as she did not seek mandatory clearance from the Planning Commission
 iske baad hi pradhanmantri ne banerjee ko ek note main railway mantralay ke sanchaalan ke bare main kuch suzav die the
 Needless to say, Banerjee does not intend to execute them
 bhartiya railway ke ek pravaktaa yah kahkar sanghathan kii vittiya badahaali kaa bachaav karte hai ki kuch chijen mantralay ke niyantran se baahar kii hai
 Quoting the figures, they say that the Railways have been paid dues in the last three years and 55,000 crore on pension, following the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission

 What was the matter: Significantly, at a five-star hotel in Delhi on Saturday night, an ANI journalist questioned Robert Vadra over the land deal
 jisase baukhalaaye jamaai raja ne patrkaar ke mike par haath de maaraa or kaaphi bhala-bura kaha
 Cleaning of Vadra: As soon as the picture of Robert Vadra's grimace appeared in the media, the news spread like a forest fire

 She left us at a very young age
 main ye khabar sunakar behad dukhi hum
 Sushma ji has caused irreparable damage to our entire country
 sushamaa ji kii aatma ko shanti mili '
 a force of nature she was
 Too young to go
 Saddened to hear this untimely news
 a nation’s loss

 ve ek behtareen vaktaa thim, ek mahaan deshbhakt thim or ek varisht leader thim
 As Foreign Minister, she was always available to every Indian who also needed help
 is dukh bhari ghadi main unke parivaar or unke folbers ke saath meri samvednaaen hai
 a huge loss for India- An outstanding orator, an absolute patriot, a tall leader @ sushmaswarajji is no more
 As an Ext Affairs minister she was always accessible to every Indian who was in need of help
 My deepest condolences to the family, loved ones & millions of followershttps: / / t
