 It therefore raises obvious questions on the motive of those working to discredit the deal, which is important for India

 The public was being misled for political gains, but this situation has become completely clear today that the accused, who were being accused by the Congress party, were baseless and had no power
 rajnath ne kaha ki janata kii ankhon main dhul jhonkkar raajnneetik kshetra main bhi lambey samay tak bhi kamyaabi hasil nahin kii ja sakati
 We believe that whatever Rafale deal is done is very fair and honest
 isse pehle daso ke siio ne bhi sthiti puri tarah se saaf kar di thi
 i understand that after the decision of the Supreme Court, there is no question of forming any other committee

 Satyamev Jayate! # rafaleverdict— Manohar Parrikar (@manoharparrikar) December 14, 2018 SC verdict completely wrong: The Supreme Court verdict on Prashant Bhushanrafel has been denied by lawyer Prashant Bhushan
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki subut ke aadhaar par rafel deal ko lekar kisi tarah kii jaanch kii koi jarurat nahin he
 The court has expressed satisfaction over the process and prices associated with the deal, but according to my opinion, the Supreme Court verdict is completely wrong
 unhone hamaare tarkon par dhyaan nahin diya
 He said that we would consider filing a reconsideration petition against the verdict, but the campaign would continue
 SC ne kiya congress ke jhooth kaa khulasarafel par aae faisle ke baad par rajyavardhan singh rathod ne kaha ki supreme court ne rafel maamle main kisi bhi tarah kii jaanch se inkaar karte hue sarkaar ke kadam kaa saath diya he
 At the same time, after the Supreme Court's decision on this issue, Sadanand Gowda said that today the Supreme Court has revealed the lies of the Congress on the Rafale issue
 aaj sach kii jeet hui
 # rafaleverdict # supremecourt, in a UNANIMOUS judgment, SC dismisses any probe into the # rafaledealand vindicates the Govt's stand

 We still demand JPC
 unhone kaha ki piem modi or bijepi ke liye supreme court ke faisle par khush hone kii koi vajah nahin he kyonki yah faisla virodhabhasi he
 The Supreme Court also said that it would not be right to go into detail

 We raised questions about the price of Rafael
 sarkaar ne kyon kaha ki ham unako kathghare main khadaa kar rahe hai?khadge ne sawaal kiya ki rafel ke daam teen guna kaise hue is par ham sawaal khadaa kar rahe hai, maafee maangane kaa isapar koi sawaal nahin uthta
 That is why we have demanded JPC
 PIL ke aadhaar par jo adhuraa bayaan diya ja rahaa he wo galat he

 But the reality of Dera Sacha Sauda and its current Gaddinshin Baba Ram Rahim is something similar, and we are not saying this, but are saying the seekers of the dera who have lived with him like a shadow for years
 sirsa ke deraa sachcha sauda kii saakh kaa ab beshak tiya-paancha ho chukaa ho
 But once upon a time, this dera used to be a center of reverence and devotion not only in Haryana but also in many surrounding states including Punjab, Rajasthan, UP
 is ashram kii buniyaad 69 saal pehle 29 april 1948 ko sant beparwaah mastaana ji maharaj ne rakhi thi
 People say that he was a rushed saint, since then, many social work has also been done on behalf of this camp
 lekin ram rahim ke gaddinshin hone ke baad dhire-dhire isaki saakh jaati rahi
 Ram Rahim was born on 15 August 1967 in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan, he used to go to the camp with his father Maghar Singh, who was a disciple of the second Gaddinshin Shah Satnam ji of the camp
 lekin shah satnam ji ne ram rahim ko 23 saal kii umr main dere kii gaddi saunp di
 Many people who are camp seekers tell that in the matter of choosing the third Gaddinshi i
e
 Ram Rahim, Shah made a mistake with Satnam ji
 ram rahim shuru se hi naa sirf rasiyaa kism kaa ladkaa tha, balki skool ke dinon se hi ladakiyon ko chhedana, aas-paas ke logon ko pareshaan karnaa uski aadaton main shumaar tha
 Gurmeet was also expelled from school in ninth class for molesting girls
 dasvin main inhen harkaton ke vajah se gurmeet fail ho gaye or unhen kampartment aayaa tha, ye baba ke dasvin kaa rigelt he
 Old people tell that when the careless Mastana ji laid the foundation of the camp, there used to be a truly spiritual atmosphere, he would teach his devotees religion and continued to teach meditation yoga for years, his disciple Shah Satnam ji also Stayed on the map lekin dhire-dhire ram rahim ke aane ke baad aadhyatm kii jagah duniyavi chakachaundh, mahangi gadiyon, kapadon, aisho aaraam kii chizon se deraa bharne laga, or ab deraa pramukh kii karatuut kaa bhanda aisa phuta he ki use sidhe salaakhon ke peeche pahunchnaa pad gaya
 It is an issue related to religion and sentiments, "chief Justice of India Jagdish Singh Khehar has commented on the request of Rajya Sabha MP Shammaniam Swamy that the Supreme Court hear his petition with immediate effect in which he disputed the disputed site of Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya
 But permission was sought to build the temple
 unhone kaha, ''aap sabhi saath milakar ek sadbhavnapurna baithak kar len
 "this was an unusual advice
 mukhya nyaayadhish ne khud is maamle main ek sambhavit madhyasth banane kaa prastaav diya
 He said, "it is better than a judicial order that the matter should be resolved concurrently
" "is par mishrit pratikriyaayein ai hai
 Union Culture and Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma termed it as "tremendous advice" that would "pave the way for the construction of the Ram temple
" " sharma ne kaha ki sarkaar samjhaute main madhyasth bananaa ''pasand karegi"
 The newly appointed Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, agreed that the government could play the role of a mediator
 uma bharti or laalkrishna adwani samet bijepi ke kai netaaon ne court kii salaah kii saraahna kii
 In its manifesto Shloka Kalyan Sankalp Patra of Uttar Pradesh, released in late January, BJP promised that it would "explore all possibilities of constructing a Ram temple in Ayodhya within the ambit of the Constitution
" " mandir banane ke prati party kii ailaania vachanabaddhata use yaa upi sarkaar ko shaayad hi adarsh madhyasth banane de
 Advocate and activist Prashant Bhushan admitted in a phone conversation that he was confused

 This is a public issue in which the entire country is a participant, not just the petitioner
 isamen kanoon ke ahm siddhant jude hue hai or adaalat ko faisla dena chahie, bajaae iske ki vah kisi nibatare kii baat kahe
 "asaduddin Owaisi, MP and head of All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen, tweeted that" the Babri Masjid case belongs to the land which the Allahabad High Court mistakenly ruled as a partnership case and therefore the Supreme Court of Appeal Is in "sitambar, 2010 main elahabaad hycourt kii khandpeeth ne 2
 The 77-acre plot was divided into three parts with two-thirds being given control to Hindu groups and one-third to the Sunni Central Waqf Board
 supreme court ne is faisle ko ''ajeeb or chankane vaala" bataate hue may 2011 main is par roak laga di thi
 Incidentally, the Uttar Pradesh government gives a grant to the Waqf Board, now headed by Yogi Adityanath, whose predecessor Digvijay Nath of Gorakhnath Math had allegedly arranged for Ramlala to be placed inside the Babri Masjid in 1949
 isi vajah se upi sarkaar is maamle main apni ghoshit praathamiktaaon ke chalate ajeebogareeb sthiti main he or kuch logon ne to vannf board se cese waapas lene ko kaha he
 Zafaryab Jilani, convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee, a party in this case, said that "if the Waqf Board withdraws the case, the case will continue with the other petitioners
" " jilani ko andeh he ki court se baahar maamla supreme court ke hastkshep ke bagaiyr sulajh paaegaa
 Negotiations have been going on since 1986 but no satisfactory solution has been found till date
 swami ne apana paksh bilkul saaf kar diya he
 He has spoken of giving the entire disputed site for the construction of the temple and asked the Muslim petitioners to satisfy themselves by building a mosque on the bank of river Saryu
 unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ''ham ram ke janm kaa sthal badal nahin sakate lekin masjid to kahin bhi ban sakati he
 "he wrote on Twitter," The Ram Janmabhoomi, approved by the Supreme Court in 1994, already has a temporary temple of Ramlala
 vahaan puja hoti he
 Can anyone dare to demolish him? ”swamy has to reply in the Supreme Court on 31 March

 'the Rage Within: Where is Ambedkar's Ethos?' satr main suraj yengde ke saath congress netaa pallam raju or bijepi netaa krishna sagar raav ne hissaa liya
 The session was moderated by India Today Managing Editor Rahul Kanwal
 suraj yengde ne kaha ki desh kii aazaadee ke 70 saal guzar chuke hai, lekin ab bhi niti nirdhaaran main dalit ko jagah nahin mil rahi he
 It started from the time of independence
 swatantraaa ke baad bani pehali cabinet main bhi dalit ko jagah nahin mili thi
 Politicians do not treat Dalits like humans
 iske chalate aaj tak dalit is desh main sirf vot bank banakar rah gaye hai
 They have no stake in the policy making of the country
 is dauraan pallam raju ne kaha ki kai jagah ab bheedliton par atyacharhota he
 However, the situation of Dalits has improved a lot at present compared to earlier
 aaj dalit itane peeche nahin he, jitne wo pehle the
 However, Suraj Yeungde says that in the last decades, political parties have created a Dalit elite, which speaks of their interest

 The officials and employees of the local administration and the body are demanding bribe in the name of giving accommodation

 Gonda district, with 16 blocks and 1000 villages, has a population of about 5 lakhs
 pradhanmantrinarendra modike 'har vyakti ko awaas' vaale elaan ke saath hi panditpura ke logon ko bhi aas lagi ki unhenpiem awaas yojanake tahat aasraa jarur milegaa lekin yahaan log tab chaunk gaye jab unke haath awaas kii ek list lagi
 In the list prepared by the local head and BDO (block Development Officer), the names of those people who already have a pucca house were recorded
 fund bhi makaan vaale logon ko jari kar die gaye
 When asked a question about this, a resident of Panditpura said, 'we did not get the fund because our name was not in the list
 hamaari fariyaad koi nahin sunata kyonki ham ghoose nahin de sakate
 'such a complaint is not just about one person
 kai logon ne dhaandhlee kii baat uthaai
 People are looking forward to the fund but all is proving to be useless
 sthaneey nikaay kaa saaf-saaf kahana he ki fund keval unhen milegaa jinka naam list main darj he
 When it was complained to big leaders and officials in Lucknow, the matter came out in some other form
 upibijepine to sara karnama pichhalisapasarkaar ke maathe madhte hue yah unki yojana bataai

 Dutt has already served an 18-month jail sentence
 tippaniyan Actress-turned-politician Jayaprada had said that she is innocent
 yah bahut durbhagyapurna he
 It was written in his luck that he would have to struggle in this way
 agar aap uske parivaar kii prishthbhumi dekhie, unke pita sunil dutt raajnneeti main the or unka bahut acha naam tha
 Maybe he did something in Masumi
 singh or jayaprada ne rajbhavan main rajyapal se mulaakaat se pehle dutt se unke bandra sthit awaas par mulaakaat kii thi
 The spokesperson said that Singh and Jayaprada met the Governor on March 26 to demand an apology for Dutt, who was sentenced to five years in the 1993 Mumbai blasts case
 dutt 18 maheene kii jail kii sajaa pehle hi kaat chuke hai
 The comments abhinetri se netaa baniin jayaprada ne kaha tha ki vah nirdosh he
 This is very unfortunate

 If you look at the background of his family, his father Sunil Dutt was in politics and he had a very good name

 Former cricketer and MP Navjot Singh Sidhu finally broke the silence over his resignation from the Rajya Sabha
 somvaar ko bijepi netritv par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said that there is nothing bigger for him than Punjab
 punjab unka ghar he, lekin unhen dilli se order aayaa ki punjab se dur raho
 Sidhu said that he therefore resigned from the post
 siddhu ne press conference ke dauraan bijepi ko katghare main khadey karat hue kaha, 'maine rajyasabha se isliye istipha diya ki mujhase kaha gaya ki tum punjab kii taraf munh karke nahin dekhoge
 i was asked to stay away from Punjab
 lekinsiddhmritsar ko diya apana vachan nahin tod saktaa
 The bird returns to its home in the evening, then how Sidhu can leave Punjab
 'navjot singh siddhu ne kaha ki unhen bina kisi kaaran ke punjab chhodane ke liye kaha gaya
 He said, 'give me some reason
 jis punjab ne mujhe chaar baar itnaa bada sammaan diya
 How can i leave him? jahaan punjab kaa hit hoga, siddhu vahaan khadaa rahegaa
 Sidhu said- i was taken away from my house
 Sidhu used to say that 'how can i leave Punjab, how can i stay away from Punjab, from my religion, how can anyone remove me from my house
 punjab se dur rahane kaa matlab main apana ghar chhod duungaa
 Which was not possible
 ' siddhu kaa kahana he ki 'punjab mere liye sabase badhkar he mujhe koi pad nahin chahie, magar punjab ke liye kuch bhi bhugatne ko taiyaar hum
 i have always wanted to serve Punjab and Amritsar
 main un logon ke saath hum
 The sideline Sidhu, who was criticized by the Badal family, said so much on the questions raised about joining the Aam Aadmi Party and the Chief Ministerial candidate that the interests of Punjab are paramount to him and he is with him who will pay attention to the interests of Punjab
 
 saaf he ki siddhu ne abhi apni aage kii ranneeti kaa khulaasa to nahin kiya magar itnaa jarur spasht kar diya ki vah punjab kii raajnneeti karnaa chaahate hai
 They also want their share in the upcoming assembly elections, which was not possible while in BJP
 kyonki akali dal nahin chahta tha ki siddhu punjab main aae or campan karen
 The reason is clear that Sidhu has been criticizing the Badal family and has said that he cannot campaign for the Akali Dal
 yahi vajah thi ki bijepi ne badal ke dabaav ke kaaran siddhu ko punjab main jane se roka
 Read, we have this hobby, see what is the fate of Sitam
 
 
 jaane, siddhu ke dil ke 13 dard'mujhe kurukshetra, dilli se chunaav ladane kaha'siddhu ne aage kaha, 'duniya kii koi bhi party punjab se upar nahin he
 If it was the first time i would have tolerated it, but it was the third-fourth time
 siddhu ko tab punjab se chunaav ladane bolaa, jab virdohi lahar thi
 Sidhu won
 logon ne vishwaas kiya or chaar baar mauka diya
 But when the wave of Modi sahib came, the opponents were submerged, Sidhu was also drowned

 unhone press conference main bijepi chhodane ko lekar bhi kuch nahin kaha

 Madan Mohan Malaviya ji's soul must be crying
 ek bhavy uniwarsity banane ke prayaason se gira unka pasinaa banaras main hi suukh gaya he
 If it were not dry, Kaushal Mishra, a professor at Banaras Hindu University (BHU), made up of his blood and sweat, would not share my number on Facebook and do not incite the crowd in the name of congratulating him for opposing India
 professor kaushal mishra biechayu main raajnneeti shaastra ke vibhaagadhyaksh hai
 Hopefully the students and the rest of the professors of that department will not be ashamed, then at least the spelling of shame
 mahaamanaa kii uniwarsity main aisa gaya guzara professor hoga, hamane kalpana nahin kii thi
 Arjun Siddharth of ALTNEWS has researched the Facebook page of Kaushal Mishra
 paaya he ki ve kai tarah kii bhraamak baaten failaate rahete hai
 Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi has posted a statement she has not given
 yahi nahin, pradhanmantri kii tasviir ke saath bhi hera-pheri kii he
 In 2004, Ujjain posted a photo of a bath in the Shipra River in January 2019, saying that there are pictures of a bath in the Ganges
 kaushal mishra aap netaa par hamale ke liye bijepi ke kaaryakartaaon ko uksaane ke aarope main 2014 main giraftaar bhi ho chuke hai
 When will there be politics on the issue of common man? The whole of Benaras gets pride from this university
 agar banaras ke logon main sochane-samajhane kii shakti samaapt nahin hui he, netaaon kii bhakthi main barbaad nahin hui he to ek baar ek minute ke liye sochen ki kya ek professor ko aisi harakat kerani chahie thi? kya biechayu ko barbaad karne main banaras ke buddhijivi bhi khushi-khushi shaamil hona chaahate hai? 2014 ke pehle banarsi logon kii thaath suna karata tha ki pappu chaay kii dukaan par white house kii politics kaa dhuaan uda dete hai lekin ab kya ho gaya he
 His Banaras professor is inciting people on Facebook
 bhadkaa rahaa he
 Is Pappu a tea shop or have intellectuals left Benaras? Not only this, Shobha Karandlaje is a BJP MP from Karnataka
 inkaa twitor handle @shobjabjp
 He has tweeted with a picture of several journalists that our job is to expose traitors
 isamen meri bhi tasviir he
 What will the MP know about me? apane or hamaare pradhanmantri se ek baar puch len ki raveesh kumaar ko expos kyon nahin kar paae paanch saal main
 i have exposed by tweeting and now you give him a two-hour live interview
 kya ab bhi aapako shaq he ki yah kaam sangathit rup se nahin ho rahaa he
 It has no support from party worker to MP
 samarthak prophessoron se lekar saamaanya samarthakon kaa samarthan nahin he
 Do you still doubt that Amit Shah and Prime Minister Modi do not support such political culture
 kashmiri chaatro kii madad ke liye aage aayaa siarpief, mere phone par trol ataikasoshal media par mujhe yaa abhisar, rohinee singh, nidhi razdan, barkhaa datta ko jo gaaliyaan or dhamkiyaan di gai hai wo inhen logon ke uksaane par di gai hai
 He has a government
 sarkaar kii shah par samarthakon se lekar netaaon tak main bhay samaapt ho gaya he
 There is no fear of public dignity
 sabko pataa he ki kuch nahin hoga
 Why BJP mps are inciting people
 biechayu kaa professor logon ko bhadkaa rahaa he
 Don't you still think that the country has been pushed into the trough? ek aisa tantra khadaa kar diya gaya he jo ab kisi ko bhi deshadrohi bataakar uske maar die jane kii paristhiti rach saktaa he
 Why do these people always make a crowd? zaahir he bulandshahr ke inspector subodh singh jaison ko maar die jane ke liye
 Apart from the abuses, i have received threats ranging from being shot
 police ko shikaayat kar di gai he
 Can police crackdown on BHU professor? Can the police ask BJP MP Shobha ji to give proof of exposing a little? unhone kis aadhaar par mujhe deshadrohi bataaya he
 What money does the election cost the patriots? mujhe bataaya gaya he ki biechayu ke chancelar ritair justise giridhar malviya hai
 He has been the proponent of Prime Minister Modi
 unase kuch ho paaegaa, karrwai karne kaa saahas he bhi yaa nahin, main nahin jaanata
 But i will definitely write a letter to Justice Giridhar Malviya so that the soul of Mahamana Malaviya does not regret that i did not shirk his heirs who are maintaining his legacy
 iskaa faisla mahaamanaa kii aatma karegi ki unke naam par jeene vaale main kirdaar tha yaa nahin
 Anger is not just insanity, so my appeal is to the President
 bharatbar kii uniwarsity ke chancelar yaa abhibhavak vahi maane jate hai
 Will they sack Professor Kaushal Mishra? If not, i have to form a regretful opinion that the venerable president is also knowingly and unknowingly involved in sanctioning troll culture
 yah kitna dukhad hoga
 Can the President, the guardian of the great republic of India, not even dismiss a professor? They have a choice
 apni purv raajnneetik vichaardhaara ke moh main fanse rahe yaa phir barkhaast kar abhibhavak hone kii parampara ko aage badhayen

 pandeya ne bhi pehle shatak ke madhyam se bhartiya team kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha lekin umr kam hone ke kaaran unhen mauka nahin mil sakaa tha
 Now that Pandey has been out of the IPL-4 bid, he will have to do well in fresh Ranji and other home matches to make a place in the Indian team

 This decision of the Governing Council has shocked all such players
 council ke is faisle se frenchiji tiimon ko bhi nuksaan hua he kyonki gharelu cricket khilne vaale khilaadiyon ko apane saath jodakar ve saste main apni team ke sangyojan ko behatar karti rahi hai
 The reason for this is that the players playing at home level get them cheaply and at the same time they do not have any kind of commitment and hence they stay with the team full time
 team india main viraat kohli kii kamyaabi kaa daur shuru hote hi bhartiya cricket main nai charchaa shuru ho gai thi
 Virat was performing brilliantly as the captain and batsman of the Test team during this period, while there was some decline in the performance of the ODI and T20 team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the captain and batsman
 jaahir he, is daur main dhoni ko hataakar viraat kohli ko captain banane ke charchaa chhidani hi thi
 Such demands also arose from the camp of some cricketers of the Indian team, but former Team India coach Gary Kirsten warned about the ill effects of Dhoni's removal from the captaincy
 tippaniyan It is a different matter that Dhoni has not been removed from the captaincy, he himself has left the captaincy of ODI and T20 lekin jab dhoni ko hataakar viraat kohli ko vanade or tii20 main bhi captain banane kii maang shuru hui thi to dakshin africa ke purv cricketer or worldcup 2011 kii jeet ke samay team india ke coach rahe karston ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 When Kirsten was asked whether the time had come that Virat Kohli would be handed over the command of the ODI team, he said, "you will get no 'answer' from me
" aap apane jokhim par dhoni ko badal sakate ho, kyonki meraa anubhav kahata he ki sabhi mahaan captainon ne apane kariyar ke ant tak shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Kirsten said that if someone wants to let MS Dhoni go, then do you know India lose some effective match-winning performances during the 2019 ODI World Cup in Britain
 'maahi' ko ‘mahaan khilaadi’ qaraar dete hue dakshin africa ke purv ballebaaj gairi karston ne unke aalochakon ko aade haath liya tha
 Kirsten said that those who doubt Dhoni's ability are making a mistake
 emes dhoni ke bhavishya ko lekar jari bahes ke bare main poochne par karston ne kaha tha, ‘main jab bhi bharat aata hum to yah sawaal mujhase poocha jaataa he
 My answer has not changed in three years
 vah (dhoni) nishchit taur par sarvshereshth captain hai, jinke saath maine kaam kiya or bhartiya cricket ke saath pichley nau se 10 saal main uskaa record sabakuch bolta he
 "from my point of view, there is no doubt that he is one of India's greatest captains and has certainly won the trophy for India in the meantime," said Kirsten

 ’ Describing 'mahi' as a 'great player', former South African batsman Gary Kirsten lashed out at his critics
 karston ne kaha tha ki jo dhoni kii kshamta par andeh kar rahe hai ve galati kar rahe hai
 When asked about the ongoing debate about the future of MS Dhoni, Kirsten said, 'I am asked this question whenever i come to India
 teen saal main meraa jawaab nahin badla he
 He (dhoni) is definitely the best captain i have worked with and his record in the last nine to 10 years with Indian cricket speaks for it all
 ’ karston ne kaha, ‘mere najariye se isamen koi andeh nahin he ki vah bharat ke mahanatam captainon main shaamil hai or is dauraan nishchit taur par bharat ke liye trophy jiti hai

 Many peculiar bowling actions have been seen in the cricket world
 isi kadi main ek or ection kaa video soshal media main viral ho gaya he
 In this video, the bowler turns around before throwing the ball and then throws the ball
 lekin ampire vinod sheshan us gend ko 'ded ball' qaraar dete hai
 The decision does not make the bowling team happy and has a long debate with the umpire
 Weirdo

 com / jk6chzyh2t — Bishan Bedi (@bishanbedi) November 7, 2018 Actually, the video is on the third day of the CK Naidu Trophy (four-day domestic tournament for under-23 state teams) between Bengal and Uttar Pradesh played in Kalyani, Kolkata
 
 bengal kii duusari pari main gendbaaji karne vaale upi ke left arm spinner shiva singh hai, jo vijeta under-19 world cap bhartiya team ke sadsy rah chuke hai
 Shiva told Cricinfo that this is not the first time he bowled in this 'manner'
 shiva ne daawa kiya ki unhone pichley maheene vijay hajaare trophy (senior 50 overon kaa toornament) main kerala ke khilaaf 360 degree kii style kii koshish kii thi, jise ampiron ne galat nahin mana tha
 Some feel that this action is completely correct, while many consider the umpire's decision to be correct
 upi ne teen dinon main bengal par pari se jeet darj kii, shiva ne match main chaar wicket chatkaaye
 Shiva said, 'I use different variations during bowling in odis and T20s
 bengal ke ballebaajon ke bich saajhedaari ho rahi thi, is vajah se maine aisi gendbaaji kii
 But the umpires called my ball dead, i want to ask what did they call the ball dead ball? unka kahana he, 'niyamon kii dhara 20

 7 (jaanboojhkar dhyaan bhang karne / dhokhadhadi / baadha daalane ke jaanboojhkar prayaas) ke tahat ampire gend ko 'ded' qaraar dene kaa hakdaar he
 At the same time, Tuffel says that it depends on the umpire what decision he makes
 lekin yah bhi bhaanpana hoga ki gendbaaj ne aisa kyon kiya
 Was it the only reason for doing this that distracting the striker? On the other hand, if it is his normal bowling, it might have a different result
 ' The formal announcement of Rahul Gandhi's election as Congress President has yet to be made
 sutron ke mutabik 14 disambar ko ve apane nirvirodh adhyaksh chune jane kaa certificate hasil karenge
 Ayub Ali, who hails from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, has made a shocking statement amid the euphoria of the Gujarat elections and the election of Congress president

 Ali claims that he submitted his nomination in 2 sets to Mullappally Ramachandran, President of the Congress Election Committee
 ali ke mutabik wo yahi sabit karnaa chaahate the ki congress par vashanvaad ko badhaava dene kii jo tohamat lagaai jaati he wo galat he or party main aantarik loktantr barkaraar he
 Ali says that he wanted to show that everyone gets equal opportunity in Congress
 ayub ali kaa kahana he ki ‘24 akbar road’par unke saath jo bartaav hua usase vah niraash hue
 When he first reached the returning officer, he was told that you can sign the offer letter
 lekin jab ali ne ye bataaya ki wo party ke rashtriya adhyaksh pad ke liye namakan bharne aae hai to vahaan baithe tamaam adhikari chowk gaye
 Ali claims that he was told that this is not possible
 sirf rahul gandhi kaa hi namakan bharaa jayega
 According to Ali, after this the documents with him were taken and asked to go outside the Congress office
 ali ke paas haalanki namakan patr bharne kii koi bhi raseed nahin he
 He claims that even after asking for the receipt, he was not given the receipt and the people surrounded him, so he had to leave from there
 haalanki ali ne congress daftar se baahar nikalate vakt apni tasviir ko dastavej ke saath twit kiya he
 According to Ali, he is a member of the Congress party and has been associated with the party since 1990
 unka kahana he ki ve shahjahanpur or uttar pradesh yuva congress ke mahasachiv bhi rah chuke hai
 According to Ali, he believes that he considers Sonia Gandhi as his leader, when Rahul Gandhi becomes president, he will also consider him as his leader
 ali ne itnaa jarur kaha ki jis tarah kaa bartaav unke saath hua usase ve aahat hai
 Ayub Ali said that Sonia Gandhi is my leader, and if Rahul Gandhi becomes president tomorrow, he will be my leader
 unhone kaha ki mulapalli agar mere saamne kah den ki maine namakan nahin diya to jo chahen wo meri sajaa hogi
 i gave nomination in the press hall of Congress
 bataa den ki congress ellection athurity ne apni press relies main yah saaf kiya tha ki rahul gandhi namakan patr daakhil karne vaale akele shaks hai
 In such a situation, Ayub Ali says that if his nomination was rejected due to formal process then it should have been mentioned but it did not happen

 darasal, pakistan ne kartarpur sahib gurudware ke darshan ke liye passport kii shart rakhi he, jisaki vajah se hajaaron log kartarpur jane kii shraddha puri nahin kar paaenge
 Such devotees have no hope other than to stand in Dera Baba Nanak and pray with folded hands even after the corridor opens

 Therefore, she is standing here and seeing

 Another devotee Bor Singh Ji Tutanwale, who arrived at Dera Baba Nanak for Darshan from Ferozepur, also believes that most people will not be able to go to Kartarpur Sahib until the passport is conditioned
 passport na maanga jaae to hoga coridor khulne kaa phaaydabor singh ji tutanvaale ne kaha, hamen is baat kii khushi he ki kartarpur coridor khul gaya he
 We would like to thank both the governments but there is a request that the passport that they have placed is not correct
 kyonki ek parivaar main keval ek-do sadasyon ke paas hi passport hota he
 The real benefit of opening the corridor will be given only if we do not ask for a passport

 hindi sahitya ke itihaas par pichhali ek shatabdi main kaaphi kaam hua or likhaa padhaa gaya he
 From Acharya Ramchandra Shukla and Hazari Babu to the new age subject matter, there have been attempts to create a sophisticated literature history by threading its links
 or ab is kadi main ek or pustak jud gai he
 The new book is 'history of Hindi Literature' and its author is Dr
 Man Singh Verma
 pustak bharat bharti prakaashan meerut se prakashit hui he or maatr 300 rupe main paperbaque sanskaran logon ke liye uplabdh he
 Though the book looks simple from the point of view of the decor and the cover, the sequence seems to have a sense of its comprehensiveness
 dow maan singh verma apane kai varshon ke prayaas ke baad ise murtarup de sake hai
 And this hard work is also reflected in the vision and formation of the book
 hindi sahitya ke itihaas ke abhi tak bataae- likhe dharre se baahar dekhne kii koshish is pustak main kii gai he
 This book has also been successful in adding some missing names and genres in the history of literature and thus it is a successful book to move towards a more inclusive history
 bhaaratendu se shuru karke hindi khadi boli ke itihaas ko dekhne kii paripati main dow maan singh verma ek or naam jodate hai
 He establishes Santkavi Gangadas (1823–1913) as the first poet of Hindi standing on the basis of his research and reasoning even before Bharatendu Harishchandra and Sridhar Pathak and made him a part of literary history
 pustak jitna peeche jaakar itihaas main gote lagaati he usee tatparta se aage kii ore bhi dekhati he or isi kram main geet-gazal or hiku ko bhi hindi lekhan kii nav vidhaon ke taur par manyata dete hue unhen bhi hindi sahitya ke itihaas main jagah di gai he
 Not only this, the book also captures the non-hindi writers and poets who have contributed to Hindi literature and includes these names in the heroes who give further expansion to the heritage of Hindi
 hindi sahitya kaa itihaas jin deshkal or paristhitiyon se guzara he or jinaki isamen bhanak dikhti he, use bhi dow maan singh verma apane itihaas lekhan kaa hissaa banaate hai
 He has also given a place in the history of Hindi literature to those faces of the freedom movement who have done the work of promoting Hindi through their writing and publicity
 vyapak pustak kaa dayrapustak hindi sahitya ke itihaas ko adikaal se shuru karte hue isamen siddh sahitya, nath sahitya or jain sahitya ko bhi sthaan detii he
 Actually, in order for Hindi to be made, it cannot be talked about by putting them out

 ' congress party ne punjab ke baad agle saal uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon ke prabandhan kaa jimmaa bhi prashanth kishor ko diya he
 Although a formal announcement of this matter is yet to be made, but next week, the party high command will announce this in a meeting of all the leaders and party officials of Uttar Pradesh
 isse pehle congress ne pichley dinon punjab chunaavon ke liye party ke chunaav prabandhan kaa jimmaa prashanth kishor ko diya tha jisaki jaankaree ek press vijyapti jari kar di gai thi
 It is being hoped that if Prashant's work is liked by the party high command in these two states, then it cannot be denied that he will be given the job of managing the elections for the Lok Sabha in the upcoming elections and the Lok Sabha in 2019
 
 lekin congress party ke netaaon kaa maananaa he ki ye sab kuch 2017 main punjab or uttar pradesh ke chunaav parinaam par nirbhar karegaa
 Prashant has had several meetings with party vice-president Rahul Gandhi before taking charge of the electoral management of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh
 tippaniyan Currently, Prashant Kishore is an advisor to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar and is engaged in the implementation of seven pre-election decisions
 haalanki prashanth kishor ke najdiki bhi maanate hai ki gujarat or bihar vidhansabha or 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon kii tulana main uttar pradesh sabase kathin chunauti he
 In Uttar Pradesh, the party not only lacks organization, but it does not have a single face that is a match between Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati
 haalanki punjab main bhi haal ke dinon main aravind kejariwal kii aam aadmi party kii badhati lokapriyata ne congress ke liye mushkilen badhaai hai
 This new responsibility by Congress to Prashant Kishore will surely create difficulties for the BJP in both these states as both Lalu and Nitish had assumed after the Bihar assembly elections that Prashant was allowed to work with the BJP for a long time
 There are no difficulties in finding tips to beat

 However, close to Prashant Kishore also believes that Uttar Pradesh is the toughest challenge compared to Gujarat and Bihar assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 uttar pradesh main party ke paas na keval sanghathan kaa abhaav he balki unke paas koi ek aisa cheharaa nahin he jo akhilesh yadav or mayawati kii takkar kaa ho
 However, in Punjab too, the increasing popularity of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party in recent times has added to the difficulties for the Congress

 CP Thakur even asked Shatrughan Sinha to leave the party
 unhone kaha, 'shatrughna sinha ke bayaan se party ko nuksaan ho rahaa he
 This is indiscipline
 party unke khilaaf karrwai karegi
 He said, 'if Shatrughan Sinha wants to leave the party, we will not stop him
 unke jane se party ko koi nuksaan nahin hoga
 It is worth noting that when Shatrughan Sinha read the praises on Nitish on Tuesday, in response, Nitish Kumar called him an elder brother

 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is leaving no stone unturned in the marketing of 'bhavantar Payment Scheme' launched for farmers in the state
 centre sarkaar bhi is yojana ko desh bhar main utaarne ke liye dilchaspee dikhaa rahi he
 Now it is different that this scheme is bad in Madhya Pradesh itself
 darasal, is yojana ke tahat jin kisaanon ne november main apane utpaada beche the, unamem se adhiktar ko jo paisa dene kaa vaada kiya gaya tha, wo unhen abhi tak nahin mila
 Such is the condition of the plight in the drought-hit areas of Bundelkhand that farmers have started migrating to cities on a large scale in search of livelihood
 bataa den ki shivaraj singh chouhan ne vigat 27 disambar ko bhavantar bhugtan yojana par vichaar karne ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ke saath mulaakaat kii thi
 Three days later, a farmer from Baldevgarh village in Tikamgarh district was out of the house
 committed suicide by putting a noose 
 hajaari naam ke is kisaan ne ghar kii diwaar par hi khud par bakaayaa karj kii rakam bhi likh di
 Under the Bhavantar Payment Scheme it was claimed that the farmers would be compensated for any difference between the minimum support price (MSP) and the model prices (MP)
 model keemten teen alag rajyon main krishi utpaada ke ausat bikri mulya ke aadhaar par tay kii jaani thim
 The suicidal farmer, Hazari, did not get any benefit from the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana as he did not have anything left to sell after the crop was ruined
 kisaanon kii ye badahaali tikamgarh jile tak hi simit nahin he
 Farmers from neighboring Panna district have started turning to cities in large numbers
 barchev gaanv se kareeb 400 kisaan kaam kii talash main dilli, gurugram or gajiabad jaise shaharon ke liye palaayan kar chuke hai

 Here farmer Surendra said, 'people of all these houses whose locks are seen hanging on the doors of you, have left the village in search of work
 ’shivaraj singh chouhan ummid lagaae baithe hai ki bhavantar bhugtan yojana ke sahare is saal hone vaale pradesh vidhansabha chunaav kii baitarani paar kar lenge
 But the ground reality is that farmers are feeling cheated about this scheme
 adhiktar kisaanon ko abhi tak abhi koi muaavja nahin mila he
 Those who sold their products in October have also received very little compensation
 soyabean kii fasal ke liye sarkaar ne yojana ke tahat emspi or empi ke bich 450 rupee prati quintal antar kii gananaa kii thi
 But traders, after announcing the scheme, manipulated the prices and reduced the prices of soyabean by Rs 1200 per quintal
 vidisha kekisansarvan yadav ne bataaya, 'maine do maheene pehle 40 quintal soyabean bechi thi lekin aaj kii taarikh tak uske badale kuch nahin mila he
 23,900 farmers in Vidisha sold their produce in mandis in November
 sarkaar kii gananaa ke hisaab se bhavantar bhugtan yojana ke tahat in kisaanon kaa 45 karod rupye bakaayaa baithta he
 According to high government sources, the government no longer has money to distribute to the farmers
 mukhyamantri chouhan ke grih jile sihor main 28,000 kisaanon ne november main apane utpaada beche, lekin unhen badale main abhi tak ek pai bhi nahin mili he

 Now there is such a system that as the train seats are filled, the fare increases continuously
 bahut se logon ko yah shikaayat he ki flixi fere lagu hone ke baad train ke kiraye is kadar bad jate hai ki kai baar train kaa tikatahawai jahajke tikat se bhi mahangaa ho jaataa he
 In this regard, Piyush Goyal said that the committee which was formed to look into these complaints has considered these things and we do not want the passengers of the railways to be forced to turn to the airplane due to expensive rent

 wo khauf jo kaamanwealth games par to agle maheene dank maaregaa lekin rajdhani ke bashidon ke liye kab se dastak de chukaa he
 This is the fear of a small dengue mosquito
 dilli main jahaan-jahaan khel hone hai, vahaan pehle se hi dengue machharon ne deraa daal rakhaa he
 How Delhi has become the capital of dengue due to the number of dengue patients crossing the thousand
 3 oktober se kaamanwealth game hone hai
 The preparation of stadiums and other sports venues is Gods faith, but looking at the dengue mosquitoes there, you can also say that Gods trust is also there to protect the players and spectators
 alam ye he ki chah khel sthanon par dengue ke machhar dank maarane ko taiyaar baithe hai
 Dengue mosquitoes have increased their empire in Delhi in such a way that government hospitals have also become ill
 or to or, desh kaa sabase bada sarkari aspataal ames bhi dengue machharon kii chapet main he
 The challans of some other big hospitals have also been cut, but neither the hospitals are ready to improve, nor the administration is ready
 dilli main dengue ke machhar is kadar faile hai ki is maamle main sarkari to sarkari, privet aspataal bhi subhaan allaah hai
 The administration has challaned two private hospitals for the fact that dengue mosquitoes have been found there
 sawaal uthta he ki aapse moti rakam vasuulne vaale privet aspataal in machharon ko roak paane main naakaam kyon hai
 God forbid you have to be admitted to a private hospital
 agar das din rah gayi to lakhon kaa bill aapako thama diya jayega or ye sab hoga achche ilaaj or saaf-safai ke naam par
 But you will be surprised to know that dengue larvae are flourishing even in big private hospitals
 sarkaar kii taraf escort or holi family jaise do bade privet aspataalon kaa chaalaan kaata gaya he or unhen notice thamaya gaya he ki dengue ke larve ko panpane se ronke
 It is not yet known what has been done for the prevention of dengue in hospitals, but the echo of this danger has reached across the seven seas
 canada ne jahaan apane khilaadiyon ko dengue se bachaav ke liye guideline thamaya he, vahi australia bhi apane khiladiyon kii suraksha ko lekar satark he
 Players, players and foreign tourists are so scared of dengue that 10 to 15 percent of bookings in hotels have been canceled
 jabaki baaki sailaani bhi puch rahe hai
 Will the mosquito bite them? And if cut, will there be a cure in Delhi? As the fear is spreading in foreign countries and government agencies are running at a slow pace, it should not be seen that in the sports hall, Delhi will be reduced to a shadow of fear
 dengue aakhir kaise naa ho? naaliyaan khuli padi hai or machharon ke larve ko nasht karne ke liye jinhen dawaai kaa chhidkaav karnaa he wo hadtaal par ja rahe hai
 But instead of stopping their strike, the rulers of the MCD are just thinking of the joke
 kapil sharma or sunil grover kii ladaai main ab nayaa mode aa gaya he
 Where yesterday Kapil Sharma posted on social media apologizing to him
 vahiin aaj subah ek twit ke jariye sunil grover ne unako khub khari-khari sunai he

 gutthi ke baad vah rinku bhabhi or doctor mashhoor gulati jaise kirdaaron ko lekar darshakon ke bich behad popular hai

 Got to learn a lot by working with you
 lekin aapako ek salaah dena chaahunga ki insaanon ko insaanon jaisi izzat dena sikh len
 Kapil Sharma is preparing to get married next year, know who is the lucky girl, everyone cannot succeed like you, nor does everyone have as much talent as you
 agar hota, to aapaki vailu koun karata
 So learn to appreciate the presence of others
 agar aapaki kisi galat baat par aapako durust karata he to use gaali na den
 Avoid using profane language, at least in front of people, especially women, who have nothing to do with your stardom
 kapil ne maangi sunil grover se maafee, marpet or badasluki kaa tha aropamai aapako is baat ke liye bhi shukriya kahata hum ki aapane mujhe ehsaas karavaaya ki yah aapkaa sho he or aap jab chahen, jise chahen isse baahar kar sakate hai
 You are the king of jokes and the best in your field

 iske peeche kaaran bhi the
 Punjab's performance last season was disappointing
 pune team ko punjab ke mukaable zyada santulit mana ja rahaa tha or uske captain steve smith is samay jabardast form main chal rahe hai
 Smith won his team's match against Mumbai Indians by hitting two sixes in the last over
 unhone is match main naabad 84 ran kii pari kheli thi
 The comments punjab ne aaj vaaki gendbaaji or ballebaaji, donon main behtareen pradarshan kiya or saare anumaanon ko galat sabit kar diya
 The team bowled first and restricted Pune's side to 163 runs in 20 overs and then the match was won by six wickets thanks to captain Glenn Maxwell's amazing
 maxwell ne apni joardaar ballebaaji se pune ke ben stokes kii 50 ran kii pari kii chamak ko feekaa kar diya
 Maxwell scored an unbeaten 44 off just 20 balls and brought victory from the Pune camp to the Punjab camp
 unke saath david miller 30 ran banaakar naabad rahe
 Naturally Maxwell was the man of the match
 jeet ke baad maxwell ne kaha, jeet ke saath shuruyaat karke acha lag rahaa he
 The season was not good for us, so we are happy to win
 ham yahaan khule dimag se aethe or vipakshi team ke har ballebaaj ke khilaaf hamaare paas yojana tha
 We cannot control the past but can definitely make the future better
 hamaara abhyaas bhi acha rahaa tha or ek practice match main hamaari team ne 230 ran ke aasapaas banaae the
 Chasing the score after testing the wicket proved to be good
 duusari ore pune ke captain smith ne kaha ki 163 ran kaa score paryaapt nahin tha

 team ne pehle sateek gendbaaji karte hue pune kii team ko 20 over main 163 ran par simit kiya or phir captain glen maxwell ke kamaal kii badaulat match chah wicket se jeet liya
 Maxwell faded the shine of Pune's Ben Stocks' 50-run knock with his strong batting
 maxwell ne keval 20 gendon par naabad 44 ran banaae or pune ke kheme se jeet punjab ke kheme main khinch laae
 David Miller remained unbeaten with 30 runs with him
 swaabhaavik rup se maxwell hi main of da match rahe
 After the win, Maxwell said, "it is good to start with a win
" hamaare liye sijan acha nahin rahaa tha, aise main jeet hasil karke ham khush hai
 We came here with an open mind and we had a plan against every batsman of the opposition team
 ham bhootkaal ko niyantrit nahin kar sakate lekin bhavishya ko jarur behatar bana sakate hai
 We also had a good practice and our team scored around 230 runs in a practice match
 wicket ke pes ko parakhane ke baad score chej karnaa acha sabit hua
 Pune captain Smith, on the other hand, said that the 163-run score was not enough
 wicket bhi duusari pari ke dauraan ballebaaji ke liye behatar ho gaya
 We needed to play with more aggressive accents

 On Wednesday, many people were surprised when some CBI officials stormed the house of their bungalow to arrest the former finance minister p Chidambaram in Delhi
 media ke ek varg ne use aesepesh kiya ki jaise isse pehle jaanch agency ne kabhi aisi tatparta nahin dikhaai thi
 But many CBI officials, especially those who have spent 5 decades or more in the agency, will surely remember the arrest of Lalu Yadav in the fodder scam
 us vakt agency cosena kii madad maangani padi thi
 The fodder scam was revealed in the last week of January 1996 and from the very first day it was discussed in detail that the then Chief Minister Lalu Yadav was involved in it
 kyonki chaara ghotaale main shaamil kai aise adhikari the,jinaki siem se nazadiiki jagajaahir thi
 It was also not hidden from anyone that his special grace was on more than one officer
 is maamle kii jaanch ke baad us samay ke sabase bade maamle jo chibasa koshagaar se sambandhit tha,usamen lalu yadav 1997 ke june maheene main chargeshited hueor mukhyamantri pad se unhen istifa dena padaa tha
 But he immediately administered the oath to his wife Rabri Devi
 jisase satta kii kaman unke or unke parivaar ke paas hi rahe
 Meanwhile, the then joint director Upen Biswas, who was heading the CBI investigation, made up his mind to arrest Lalu Yadav
 court se warrant bhi hasil kar liya, lekin unhen sarkaar se is warrant ko taamil karaane ke liye jo sahyog chahie thavo nahin mil rahaa tha
 When they asked for the police force, some soldiers were sent
 isse kshubdh hokar bishwas ne29 july kii raatus samay ke rajya ke police mahanideshak eskesxena or mukhya sachiv se mulaakaat kii,lekin baat nahin bani
 On the other hand, thousands of his supporters continued to gather in and out of Lalu Yadav's Chief Minister's residence
