 sansad main avishvaas prastaav par charchaa ke dauraan vipaksh kii ore se mahila suraksha kaa mudda uthaaya gaya
 Recently, a charge of 40 people with a 22-year-old woman in a guest house in Panchkula town of Haryana shook everyone in the country
 isi bich soshal media par bhi ek massej jamkar viral ho rahaa he, jisamen yah daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki police ne raat main akele safar karne vaali mahilaon ke liye ek helpline number jari kiya he
 It is also being said in the message that whenever the woman sits alone in an auto or taxi at night, message the vehicle number on 9969777888
 massej ke daawey ke mutabik police jeepiares kii madad se phir us vaahan par mahila kaa safar puraa hone tak najar rakhegi
 Nothing has been said in the message about which state police has made this arrangement
 bas massej ke saath ek police afasar kii photo lagaai gai he jinka naam suresh aroda bataaya gaya he
 This message has been shared more than 50,000 times so far
 saath hi log caments ke jariye is vyavastha ke liye police kii jamkar peeth thok rahe hai
 One such thing is written in the message, which casts doubt on it
 massej main likhaa hua he ki GPRS technology kii madad se taxi par najar rakhi jaaegi
 Whereas GPS technology is used to know or monitor any location, not GPRS
 india today fact check team ne jab massej kii sachai jaanane ke liye die gaye phone number par ek taxi kaa number massej kiya to duusari taraf se bhi ek massej aayaa, jisame likhaa hua tha- jaankaree ke liye dhanyavad, immergency ke liye 100 number kol karen- mumbai police aapaki seva main
 Now it was to find out whether the Mumbai Police actually started this helpline to strengthen female security? When contacted in this regard, Mumbai Police got the reply- 'on 8 March 2014, Mumbai Police had taken an initiative called' Travel Safe When Alone 'in association with MTNL
 isi ke saath hi is helpline number ko jari kiya gaya
 But it was discontinued on 2 March 2017
 ’mumbai police kaa kahana tha ki ho saktaa he yah number abhi bhi MTNL kii taraf se chaalu ho isiilie is number par massej karne par jawaab main mumbai police se sampark karne kii pratikriya milti ho
 It became clear from the response of the Mumbai Police that such a system for the safety of women was started by the Mumbai Police, which has now been closed
 internet par khojane par yah bhi pataa chal gaya ki viral massej main jin suresh aroda naam ke police afasar kaa zikr kiya gaya he wo punjab police ke dijipi he
 If you wanted to know the truth of this message from the Punjab Police through Twitter, then the clear answer came from that "this message is absolutely fake, it should not be spread
" '' punjab police kaa mahila suraksha ke liye helpline number 181 he
 Please note that this is a fake news
 Please don't spread it
 - Punjab Police (@punjabpolice) July 24, 2018 The helpline number mentioned in the viral message has nothing to do with Punjab Police or DGP Suresh Arora
 aisa nahin he kii is massej ko soshal media par pehali baar failaayaa ja rahaa ho
 Earlier too, this message was shared extensively with the photo of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 saaf he ki is tarah se massej failaane se koi sarthak parinaam to nahin nikalataa ulate bhram failane se police or nagarikon ko bina matlab kii pareshaani jarur jhelni pad jaati he

 According to the DDA, there are fewer applications, but this can be considered a good gesture for buyers as the chances of getting flats for applicants have increased considerably due to less applications

 According to DDA Commissioner JP Agarwal, in the last few years in Delhi NCR, private builders have been made flats in many areas where people have also done bookings, due to which applications of DDA flats have come down this time

 nai dillih vah bhartiya shastreey sangeet ke aise sitare hai jinaki shoharat keval is dharti par hi nahin, balki antariksh main bhi gunj rahi
 a space planet has been named after him
 ham baat kar rahe hai pandit jasraj kii, josahitya ajtak 2019ke manch par honge
 The music of the melodious voice of Martand Pandit Jasraj, embellished with honors such as Sartaj of tunes, melodious saints, ragas of ragas and Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, is not only India but people all over the world
 sahitya ajtakake manch par pandit jasraj apni uplabdhiyon, apni sadhana or jivan anubhavon jaise vishay par aapse mukhaatib honge
 28 January 1930 Pandit Jasraj was born in Hisar district of Haryana, in a family whose ancestors not only kept Indian classical music alive, but also raised it so big as a tree that its name would ring all over the world
 Huh
 mewati gharaane ke sabase chamakate sitare sangeet ke surya jasraj kii awaz saadhe teen saptakon main ek vishisht pahchaan rakhti he
 Murkies, gams, meand and tones of relaxation are the specialty of his singing
 unke suron kaa jaadu krishna kii murali kii tarah he
 The one who listens, gets lost in his music and gets lost in his music
 sahitya ajtakasur, kala, sahitya or samskruti kaa mahakumbh yon hi nahin he
 If Pandit ji is on the stage, it is natural for his notes to resonate
 sangeet ke rasik unhen rasraj kehete hai
 Hearing 'mero Allah Mehraban' in the Raga Bhairav from their mouths seems to have broken the wall of religion between God and Allah, and this world has become one in the divine
 pandit jasraj ne apni jaadui awaz main film 1920 kaa yah gaanaa ‘vaada tumse he vaada’ bhi gaaya tha, jisamen unki sureeli awaz ne aaj kii yuva peedi ko madahosh kar diya tha
 The accent found in the singing of Pandit Jasraj, who adorns the stage of Sahitya Aaj Tak, reflects the peculiarity of the 'khayal' style of the Mewati Gharana
 unhone baba shyaam manohar goswami maharaj ke saath 'haveli sangeet' kii kai nai bandishon kii rachana bhi kii he
 When the International Astronomical Union named a planet after Pandit Jasraj, it became a matter of pride for India and especially the classical music world
 dharti se akaash tak chamak rahe ‘pandit jasraj’ ko suniye 'sahitya ajtak 2019' ke manch par
 So what is the delay, do not think, registration of literature's biggest Mahakumbh 'sahitya Aaj Tak 2019' is absolutely free
 sahitya kaa yah jalsa har saal kii tarah is saal bhi indira gandhi rashtriya kala centre main 1 november se 3 november ko lagane ja rahaa he
 Free registration has started for Sahitya Aaj Tak 2019

 ek parivaar se sanchalit party kaa dansh har chunaav main jhelane vaali congress punjab chunaav main is baar parivaarwaad ko peeche chhodkar aage badhane kii baat kah rahi thi
 But its leaders are not taking much interest in improving this image
 isi liye ab congress netaa chaahate hai ki punjab chunaav main unke parivaar ke sadasyon ko tikat mili
 This is the reason when applications were sought from Punjabcongress for the candidature of the ticket for the upcoming assembly elections from its leaders and activists
 to usase pehle saaf kar diya gaya tha ki koi bhi netaa yaa kaaryakarta apane parivaar main se ek aplicoshan se zyada file naa karen
 The reason is clear that the party does not want to take the charge of familism with its head in the upcoming Punjab Assembly elections
 misaal kaayam karne ke liye punjab congress adhyaksh ne ye sandesh bahut pehle apane party ke tamaam leaderon or kaaryakartaaon ko de diya tha or khud captain ne apane parivaar main se apana hi nomination party se tikat hasil karne ke liye file kiya
 But now, cheating their own party, more than ten senior leaders of the party filed for nomination of their family, their son or daughter, or their wife, daughter or son-in-law from the nomination party
 The charge was served on the plate to the opposition to say that the Congress party can never get out of dynasticism
 in netaaon ne kii tikat kii mangparty ke rajya ke jin senior leaderon ne apane or parivaar ke sadasyon ke liye tikat kii maang kii he unamem laal singh, rajendra cor bhattal, indrajit singh jira, rana gurmeet sodhi, amarik singh dhillon, pratap bajva shaamil hai
 At the same time, the party leaders who are facing allegations of not giving up their family's say that they have not broken any rules of the party and the party will give tickets to any of their family, they will approve it and they know That only one person in the family will give a ticket party
 akali dal ne lee chutakicongress ke bich chal rahi is nurakushti ne vipakshiyon ko chutki lene kaa mauka de diya he or akali dal ne kaha ki congress ko lekar unki party ke leaderon ke man main dar he ki wo satta main to nahin aane vaali bas kuch bhi karke wo apni seat bachaa len or kisi bhi tarah ke jugad se wo yaa unke parivaar kaa koi bhi sadsy bas vidhayak ban jaae
 The Congress has always been accused of increasing familism and to get out of the same thing, Congress had decided to leave behind these allegations in Punjab elections this time, but on this initiative of Congress, adopt the senior leaders of his party
 And the ticket-fascination for the members of his family is outnumbered
 said anwar ne pakistan ke liye 55 test main 45
 He had scored 4,052 runs at an average of 52, while he scored 8,824 runs in 247 odis, including 20 centuries and 63 half-centuries, and an average of 39

 Just before the Lok Sabha election, Priyanka Gandhi's younger sister Priyanka Gandhi stepped into politics and created a ruckus in the BJP camp
 priyanka ke loksabhaa chunaav ladane par unke bade bhai rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ham baikfoot par nahin balki frontroot par khelenge
 Priyanka was entrusted with the responsibility of eastern Uttar Pradesh, making her the national general secretary of the Congress
 iske baad congress varisht netaa kapil sibbal ke twit kiya, jiske lekar sawaal uthne lage hai ki kya priyanka gandhi varanasi se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf chunavi maidan main utrengi
 In fact, Kapil Sibal tweeted on Thursday, 'modiji and Amit Shah called for a Congress-free India
 priyanka gandhi ke ab purvanchal kii siyasat main aane se ham dekhenge 
 
 
 
 mukt varanasi?

 The Congress party will fight these elections with full power

 Now after entering politics, he has been given the responsibility of eastern Uttar Pradesh

 However, Purvanchal used to be a strong Congress constituency in one phase

 team india ke captain kool mahendra singh dhoni ne mana ki dakshin africa daure par teji or oochaal se talmail bithaana unki yangistan team ke liye badi chunauti hogi
 Team India has visited South Africa for the series of 3 odis and 2 Tests
 guuruuvaar ko mehmaanon ko dakshin africa ke khilaaf pehla vanade match khelnaa he
 Before the odis, Dhoni said, "the biggest challenge is to keep pace with the boom and the boom"
 agar aap international cricket main nae ho to yah badi chunauti ban jaati he
 The reason behind this is that you do not get such speed and bounce even on the best wicket in India
 ’'aakhir main anubhav main myne rakhata he'unhone kaha, ‘isliye jin khilaadiyon ne abhi international cricket main padaarpan kiya ho unke liye yah thodaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Dhoni, however, believes that there are some players in his team who have international level experience
 unhone kaha, ‘lekin hamaare paas kuch khilaadi aise hai jo pichley kuch satr se khel rahe hai or unhone duniya bhar main acha pradarshan kiya he
 When you play on the same ground, you know how the conditions will be and it benefits
 aakhir main anubhav myne rakhata he
 "taking wickets and scoring runs" This series will see a fierce competition between Indian batsmen and South African bowlers
 dhoni ne kaha, ‘ballebaajon ke khilaaf hameshaa ranneetiyaan banaai jaati hai
 Batsmen also make their own strategy to deal with bowlers
 ahm chunauti yah he ki aap alag paristhitiyon ke anuroop apana khel kaise dhaalte ho
 More important than strategies is who scores more runs and who takes more wickets
 ’gendbaajon ke pradarshan se khush nahin hai dhonibhartiya gendbaaji ko dakshin africa kii tulana main kamjor mana ja rahaa he lekin dhoni ne kaha, ‘mahatvapurn yah he ki aap paristhitiyon kaa kaisaa phayda uthaate ho
 Dhoni said, 'it is not important that you have the best bowlers
 mujhe lagata he ki hamane acha pradarshan kiya he
 There are ups and downs
 jab maidan par os hoti he yaa wicket bilkul sapaat hoti he to hamen sachmuch main sangharsh karnaa padataa he
 This is an area in which our bowlers have not performed very well
 ’'utaar-chadhaav se ham khush hai'dhoni ke mutabik, ‘lekin agar unhen madad milti he to tej gendbaaj ho yaa spinner, unhone iskaa phayda uthaaya he or acha pradarshan kiya he
 So we are happy with what he did
 utaar-chadhaav se ham khush hai
 Dhoni admitted that he had not seen the pitch
 unhone kaha, ‘aap kahin bhi khel rahe ho agar aapane wicket bachaae hai to antim aath se 10 over main achche ran bana sakate ho
 Wickets in the subcontinent slow down and sometimes it is not easy for the new batsman to come and play the shot immediately
 aise halaat main ham pratispardhi score nahin bana pate
 "runs will be scored in slog overs", he said, "if there is good bounce and speed, then we have seen that batsmen score runs in the last eight to 10 overs (slog overs) and they make a strong score
 ’ bhartiya captain ne kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki dakshin africa aisi jagah hai jahaan yah kaaphi had tak nirbhar karata he ki halaat kaise hai, wicket kaise taiyaar kiya gaya he or badal chhaae hai yaa dhoop khili he jab wicket ballebaaji ke liye acha hota he
 Much depends on how the situation is on that day
 ’'dakshin africa main kharaab record ke bare main nahin soch rahe ham'bharat siries main duniya kii number ek vanade team ke rup main utrega lekin bharat ne dakshin africa main kabhi dwipaksheeya siries nahin jiti he or vanade main unka record bhi kharaab he
 Dhoni said, 'it is not a matter of strong contender
 kharaab record hamaare jehan main nahin he lekin aise udhaaharan hai jab hamaare paas siries jeetne kaa mauka tha lekin hamane iskaa phayda nahin uthaaya
 So it is very important what kind of game you show that day
 hamane dekha he ki vanade main aapako acchhee shuruyaat kii jarurat hoti he
 With the rule of two new balls and especially if the conditions are favorable for fast bowlers, then it is important that how you play in the first 10 overs
 wicket haath main hone par antim 15 over main pratispardhi score banaaya ja saktaa he

 The situation in Delhi is still not clear about the election, however, in the wake of the Lok Sabha elections, the political tug of war between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress is getting more rapid
 isi kadi main kal dilli congress daftar main netaaon kii badi baithak bulaai gai thi jisamen takreeban 68-70 naam kii list congress alaakaman ko bheji gai
 In this meeting, Congress leaders announced in one voice that the Congress will contest all seven Lok Sabha seats on its own in Delhi and they do not accept any alliance with Kejriwal
 dilli congress kaaryakari adhyaksh or purv mantri haaron yusuf kaa bhi safataur par kahana he ki shila dikshit ke aane se congress kaaryakartaaon main puri tarah se josh he or dilli kii saaton loksabhaa seat par congress jeetegi kyonki kejariwal ke jhuthe vaayadon ko dilli kii janata puri tarah pahchaan chuki he
 Taking a dig at the way the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi is looking forward to an alliance with the Congress, Congress Working President Aaron Yusuf says that this uneasiness of Kejriwal is the confidence of the Congress and it shows that all of Delhi The Congress is going to win all the seven seats on its own and now Kejriwal has no existence in Delhi
 to vahiin duusari taraf congress se koi vaazib jawaab nahin milane ke baavjood bhi sattarudh aam aadmi party gathbandhan ko samay kii maang bataati najar aa rahi he chaahe congress ke saath yaa congress ke bina or aap party bhi apane dam par chunaav ladane kii taal thokati najar aa rahi he
 AAP leader Sanjay Singh says that the Aam Aadmi Party will show seven Lok Sabha seats on its own
 jaahir he jaise-jaise loksabhaa chunaav kareeb aa rahe hai vaise-vaise kejariwal or congress ke bich gathbandhan kii khabaron kii talkhiyaan bhi saaf jaahir hone lagi he or yah talkhiyaan party netaaon ke bayanon main saaf najar aa rahi hai
 Now it will have to be seen whether the battle against the BJP in Delhi will be fought with the bravery of the statements or the alliance with the alliance
 kuch visheshgyon kaa bhale hi maananaa ho ki bhartiya diggaj ballebaaj sachin tendulkar kii vidaai test shrunkhlaa main bharat ne west indies kii kamjor team kaa saamana kiya, lekin purv bhartiya tej gendbaaj manoj prabhakar ne kaa kahana he ki carabian team pratispardhi thi
 Manoj Prabhakar said, "when the West Indian team was at the top, the opposing teams were afraid of them
 
 
 bharat ke khilaaf test shrunkhlaa unhone bhale hi buree tarah ganvaai ho, lekin vah phir bhi pratispardhi team he
 
 
 No one can say that India found a weak opponent
 
 
 '' Asked about Sachin Tendulkar scoring 74 runs in the last international innings, Manoj Prabhakar said, "sachin Tendulkar had prepared well for the Test series by playing in a Ranji match
 
 
 pehali pari main usne jis tarah ballebaaji kii, vah shandaar thi
 
 
 He wanted to make the farewell memorable and he did so
 
 
 '' It is noteworthy that when Sachin Tendulkar made his international debut in 1989, Manoj Prabhakar was part of the Indian team and the former fast bowler said that there was no change in this great batsman during his disputed career
 manoj prabhakar ke anusaar, ''sachin tendulkar ne 24 saal lambey apane kariyar ke dauraan bina kisi vivaad ke desh kii seva kii
 
 
 Every time he played for the country, he did his work every time
 
 
 usne kabhi safalataa ko apane dimag par haaavee nahin hone diya or hameshaa apane pair jameen par rakhe
 
 
 He remained the same person till the end, in 1989
 
 
 '' Former 50-year-old cricketer Manoj Prabhakar said, "he maintained the same discipline throughout his life
 
 
 usne apane jivan ke sabase achche din desh ko de die
 
 
 His honesty towards the game made him such a great cricketer
 
 
 '' On the other hand, another former cricketer Maninder Singh also said that Sachin Tendulkar said goodbye to the game with perfect speech
 unhone kaha, ''sachin apni antim pari main behtareen tha
 
 
 His departure was unmatched
 
 
 match ke baad unke bhaashan ne sabhi ko bhavuk kar diya
 
 
 i had expected him to make an emotional speech
 
 
 '' The sweepers working in East Delhi have gone on strike once again
 purvi dilli nagar nigam ke mukhyalay ke baahar 18 may ko pradarshan karne ke saath hi is hadtaal kii shuruyaat ho gai lekin is baar hadtaal kaa pehle jaisaa asar nahin dikh rahaa he
 Actually, the biggest reason behind this is the lack of opinion of the union of the sanitation workers about the strike
 emsidi swatchta karmchaaree union ke sadsy beete kai dinon se apni maangon ko lekar east emsidi mukhyalay ke baahar dharne par baithe hai
 He says that his demands are deferred every time by making an excuse
 yahi vajah he ki unhen baar-baar hadtaal par janaa padataa he
 This time even though he is on strike, his protest does not show any edge
 pehle jahaan hadtaal par jate hi safai karmchaaree sadakon par kooda failaa dete the
 At the same time, such pictures are not visible
 poochne par ve kehete hai ki hoicourt ke aadesh kii vajah se ve is baar sadakon par kooda nahin faillaayenge
 However, he said that if there is litter, he will not pick it up
 vahiin safai karmchaariyon kii hi duusari union, dilli pradesh safai majdoor union ke rajendra mewati kaa kahana he ki unki union isliye hadtaal main shaamil nahin he kyonki hadtaal kii raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Some union leaders serve their political interests through the strike and end the strike as soon as it is completed
 thode din baad hi phir se hadtaal shuru kar dete hai
 Apart from this, they say that when the swearing in East Delhi is to be held on 22 May, then there is no justification for going on strike before that
 kooday ke dher nadaardasafai karmchaariyon kii union main do-faad kaa asar hadtaal par saaf dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 On the second day of the strike, when the Aaj Tak team visited Mayur Vihar and Vinod Nagar, there were no piles of garbage
 yahaan tak ki un dhalaav par bhi kooda naa ke baraabar tha jahaan puure mohalle kaa kooda aata he
 There is a clear contradiction among the unions about the strike
 issesafai karmchaarionmen bhram kii sthiti he lekin iskaa phayda sidhe taur par dilli kii janata ko mil rahaa he
 Haryana government on Wednesday transferred 5 IAS officers
 ye sabhi tabadale swasthya vibhaag se jude hue hai
 These officers include Pradeep Kasani, who was transferred for the 63rd time in 31 years of service
 angreji akhbaar 'da indian express' ne yah khabar chhaapi he
 In the reshuffle on Wednesday, the Haryana government has entrusted the responsibility of Secretary and Director General of Archives Department to Kasni
 gudgaanv ke mandlayukta pad se hataane ke kareeb ek maah tak khaali rahane ke baad pradeep kaasni ko medical ajukeshan or anusandhan vibhaag main mahanideshak ke pad niyukti mili thi
 Actually, Pradeep Kasani found it expensive to investigate the construction of Kalpana Chawla Medical University being built in Karnal
 kaasni ne uniwarsity ke nirmaan main gadabadjhaalaa kii ashanka ke chalate puraa hisaab-kitaab maanga tha
 The central government agency that created the university did not find it appropriate

 aise tamaam vimarsh hai
 The movie Kochanayan has a star appeal, tremendous sets, action, romance, dance and drama
 film main nae kism ke anemeshan kaa istemaal kiya gaya he
 It seems to be the link between the original and the animation so far
 aisa prathit hota he ki hero kii shakal or taur tareeke sachhee-muchchi ke hai, magar uski deh or chaal chalan eminatede hai
 This will prove to be a new type of experience
 film main star power ke naam par rana or kochaneyan ke role main rajnikant hai
 His girlfriend Vadna is Deepika Padukone
 unke hisse cinema ke chalan ke mutabik dance or gane bhi aae hai
 Jackie Shroff has both shades in the role

 a special feature of this film is the variety of action and the gorgeous sets

 Kochanayan children will like it very much

 Sawant said that if any provision of the Constitution is temporary and someone is reforming it, then why should it be opposed? The Shiv Sena leader also said, 'we should think that the people of Kashmir have suffered the most due to Article 370

 He alleged that due to Article 370, many important laws of the country could not be implemented in Jammu and Kashmir and its loss only to the people of the state

 On Sunday, Vijender Gupta accused the Delhi government that people are troubled by the huge water scarcity in Delhi and the Delhi government is sitting hand in hand
 vijendra gupta yaheen nahin ruke
 He warned the government that the BJP MLA would raise the issue of outcry due to lack of water in Delhi in the House of Delhi Assembly on Monday
 vijendra gupta ne aarope lagaaya kidilli sarkaarpani kii uchit supplai ko lekar gambhir nahin he or yahi vajah he ki abhi tak naa to samar plan hi dikhaai de rahaa he or naa hi sarkaar dwaara pani kii uchit aapurti ke liye koi rodmap banaaya gaya he
 Vijender Gupta, while making serious allegations on the Delhi government, said that on one hand people are troubled by lack of water
 vahiin duusari taraf dooshit pani kii supplai ke kaaran desh kii rajdhani dilli main hajaaron log pilia or haija jaisi jal-janit bimariyon kaa shikaar ho rahe hai
 Vijender Gupta alleged that sewer water comes together with drinking water at various places throughout Delhi and smelly water is being supplied
 vajirpur hatya kaa bhi kiya zikravijendra gupta ne kuch dinon pehle vajirpur main pani ko lekar hue jhagade ke dauraan bujurg kii hatya kaa bhi mudda uthaaya or kaha ki, 'vajirpur ilaake main pani kii kami ke jhagade main hui bujurg kii maut se bhi dilli sarkaar kii ankhen nahin khuli hai

 duusari ore, china ke ek baar phir kaha he ki vah enesji ke niyamon ke paalan ke bina bharat, pakistan yaa duusare kisi bhi desh kaa sadsyta ke liye samarthan nahin kar saktaa
 China has cited the rules saying that its opposition to India is on the basis of rules

 ek sheersh bhartiya sainya adhikari ne yahaan somvaar ko kaha ki pakistan kii aantarik sthiti us desh ko jammu evam kashmir mudde par apni niti main badlaav nahin laane degi
 He is continuously sending terrorists to India
 bhartiya sena ke 16wein kor ke general officer kamanding leftinent general enpi nehra ne yahaan 'masping pakistan' vishay par ek seminar kaa udghaatan karte hue kaha, "pakistan kii aantarik sthiti chaahe jaisaa bhi ho, vah apni kashmir niti main badlaav nahin laaegaa
 "later in a conversation with reporters, he said that Pakistan is 'constantly intruding'
 vah seemapar se aatankwaadiyon ko bhej rahaa he, lekin sena satark he or unke prayaason ko vifal karne ke liye din-raat ek kiye hui he'
 It is noteworthy that the troops subordinate to General Nehra are guarding about 400 km of the Line of Control on the land of Kashmir divided between India and Pakistan
 pakistan main philhal takhtapalat kaa mausam to nahin he, lekin yah islamic ganraajya ek baar phir gahraate naagarik sainya sankat kii ore bad rahaa he
 The US is sitting on its neck, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is standing at the door, China sneaks into its kitchen and ISIS is hiding in its basement
 iske baavjood pakistan main jo siyaasi or prashasnic gadabadjhaalaa machaa padaa he, vah abhootpurv he
 Its sky is clouded with a constitutional, economic and security crisis
 desh kaa aalaa netritv padchyut pradhanmantri navaj sharif or unke parivaar ke ird-gird gum rahe kanoonee or rajnatik satta sangharsh main fansaa padaa he
 On the other hand, its nuclear-powered friend China is suffering the consequences of the crisis of governance here, which according to some observers may result in any of these forms: fresh elections, cleanliness of the politics under the judiciary, economic bankruptcy, an interim government, a new wave of terrorism and even a tense situation with India perhaps with the US
 itnaa to tay he ki philvakt yahaan koi takhtapalat nahin hone vaala
 This is because now the judges are the new generals here and the generals have become diplomatic
 jahaan tak loktantric tareeke se chune hue netaaon kii baat he to ve sab har kisi ke saath or yahaan tak ki khud se bhi ek jang main mubtila hai
 In all these situations, if something is at stake, then it is the political fortunes of the family who ruled the country for the longest time
 isi ke saath mulk kii siyaasi takadir bhi natthi he
 First family, after the Supreme Court was demoted due to undisclosed income in the first family, people thought that Nawaz Sharif would now leave easily, he had expired and he would quietly go to London to rest
 yah maan liya gaya tha ki ve ab apane sakasham bhai shahbaaj ke liye raajnneeti main rasta banaaenge jo us punjab ke mehnatee mukhyamantri hai jis par assi ke dashak ke baad se hi sharif khandaan kaa raaj rahaa he jab jiya kii sainya satta se uski paidaaish hui thi
 After the by-election byelection, it was assumed that Shahbaz would now take over the reins of the party and the next general election would be held by the time of next summer
 phir yah mana gaya ki jo sabase acchhee party hogi, vah jeet jaaegi or zyada se zyada ek gathbandhan sharif kii pakistan muslim lig- navaj (piemail-en) kii jagah le legaa or navaj kii anupasthiti main swaabhaavik taur par ulajhaa rahegaa
 The rest, if Nawaz and his family are in good luck, will go into self-exile, or will be forced to face more than 18 lawsuits involving accountability
 inamen se kuch bhi nahin hua
 Now call it a sign of tremendous patience, or nappy-bent insanity and scattered confrontation, but this is the third time that not only the former Prime Minister but his entire family is not ready to retreat
 agast main navaj ne ek rajya-pryojit ghar vaapasi raily nikaali thi jab ve islamabad se saikadon kaa kafila lekar chale or punjab kii jiti road se guzarate hue aisa maahaul banaaya ki kafila hajaaron main tabdeel ho gaya
 He reached Lahore with a lot of pride
 kai dinon kii yatra ke dauraan unhone achche-khaase samarthakon ko juta liya tha
 Then he openly challenged "what those people" have done to them
 is tarah unhone apni party ko nayaa naaraa dene kii koshish kii jo is sawaal ke rup main tha ki ''mujhe kyon hataaya gaya?"jaahir he, yah ek nayaa sattavirohi jumala tha- ''mujhe kyon nikaala?" fouj palatwaar kii ummid nahin kar rahi thi
 The judiciary also remained silent
 vipaksh us dauraan oonghta rahaa
 Imran Khan, after months of hard work in the Panamaliks hearing, was resting in the hills of Nathiagali
 navaj virdohi dhade ne kabhi bhi unki kaat nikaalane ke bare main nahin sochaa
 He continues to believe that all this exercise is the last drama of a cursed man
 monsoon ke ve din sharif kii rajnatik vaapasi ke din the, lekin kisi ko iskaa na to andaja rahaa or na hi kisi ne unhen chunauti di
 This carelessness is now overshadowed

 He had thrown Jung's old plan in the garbage
 shahbaaj ko darkinar kar diya gaya—kuch kaa kahana tha ki ve fouj ke kaaphi kareeb the
 Others said that their need is important to run Punjab because the real vote bank in Pakistan is what matters here
 navaj ne pratikatmak or siyaasi rup se ahm lahore ke upachunaav main apni patni kulsum ko khadaa kar diya
 The court had taken this seat from him
 centre ke str par tikaoo sarkaar ke vaade ke saath ek jabardast chaal chali ja rahi thi
 Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was elevated to the post of interim prime minister, a great loyalist to Nawaz, a graduate from UCLA, fit for both the US and the military but lacking the iron to challenge Nawaz
 ve muri kii paharipoon tale shant maidani ilaake se aate hai
 In this way there was no difference between the new and the old Wajire Azam
 kad main ooncha hone ke baavjood rasookh main kamatar abbasi ne khuleam kaha ki ve ab bhi navaj ko hi report kar rahe hai
 Nawaz's wife was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer in London and had also won by a margin of less than the expected margin in Lahore by-election
 abhi haalanki piemail-en ke nae chehre ke manch par aane kaa intjaar tha—mariyam, navaj kii sabase badi bitiyaa or party ke media prachaar kii dhuree, jo aaj apane pita kii asli uttaradhikari banakar ubhar chuki hai
 Mariam proved herself in the by-election
 unke aalochak haalanki kehete hai ki imran khan kii pakistan taharik-e-insaaf bamushkil piemail-en se kuch hi peeche chal rahi thi
 However, concerns about transparency and "missing" activists emerged after his arrival, and the biggest thing was that the military-led Milli Muslim League (the new political face of Hafiz Saeed's jamaat-ud-dawa) and Labbak Or the Rasool Allah Party (a staunch and pro-kufr law-born religious movement in Lahore), with 15,000 votes in support of Maryam's campaign
 achaanak lahore kendrit in do nai dakshinpanthi partiyon kii kamyaabi ne udaarpanthi or kuch kam udaarpanthi siyaasi halkon main khalabali paidaa kar di
 Questions arose as to whether the ISIS political faction had made a move or that Mullah had suddenly become active by taking advantage of his old support base in Lahore? The debate could have arisen before Maryam settled it
 piemail-en bhale chunaav jeet gaya tha, lekin mariyam or unki prachaar mashinari ne satta pratishthan ko raajnneeti kii mukhyadhara main jihadiyon ko ghusaane ke liye aade haathon liya
 His strong side was clear that despite winning the election, he did not have the same enthusiasm on his face
 jald hi sitambar ke madhya tak sab kuch saaf ho chukaa thah jiti road kii raily or lahore upachunaav main jeet ke baavjood yah parivaar ab bhi ghutane techne ko taiyaar nahin tha
 He had to make a political comeback and was willing to do everything for it

 They allege that more and more Fatima will remain a shadow like Jinnah

 They even question his work
 iske baavjood koi shaq nahin ki mariyam navaj sharif kaa nayaa sanskaran hai
 He has an anti-incumbency legacy of his father and also demands a complete dedication and loyalty from the front
 unke padchyut hone ke baavjood ve unki chif of staff hai or vafaadaar mantriyon va naukarshahon kii kaman apane haath main rakhti hai
 They work according to them

 She dresses modestly in the crowd, but she is also a hotbed of discussions on the drawing room and whatsapp
 unki media mashinari chutki bajaate hi chaalu ho jaati he
 After the army, he is the highest runner on the media
 isse zyada ahm yah he ki mariyam islamabad ke satta sameekaran main waapas lautne kii khwaahish rakhti hai jahaan se unke pita, pati or bhaaiyon ko hakaal diya gaya he
 At the moment, she is openly blaming the army for this but she has no concrete evidence yet
 ab bhi ve chizon ko har din bitate atiranjit karne kii aadat se baj nahin aati hai jabaki unke vafaadaar mantri unke badbolepan ko santulit karne ke liye sansad or tok sho ke halkon main kehete najar aate hai ki sharif parivaar ke saath koi sajeesh nahin hui he
 Meanwhile, Maryam has succeeded in making herself the face of power acting like an opposition without a post
 jaisaa ki ek tippaneekar ne haal hi main kaha, mariyam ne sharif khandaan ko do tukdon main bhi baant diya he
 Now she represents one side of the family
 is bich sarkaar par jab rajkaaj thik se nahin chalaa paane ke aarope lag rahe hai, shahbaaj ko ab tak koi kendriya pad nahin mil sakaa he jabaki aadhikarik rup se ve ab bhi apane bhai ke saath hi hai or bheetar chal rahi khadbadahaton ke baavjood navaj yaa mariyam se yah adhikaar chhinane kii unamem siyaasi takat nahin he
 What Mary has thought is only for her father and at least for herself — of course, only with her father's consent
 vaapasi, riyaayat yaa doshasiddhi?pakistan ke punjab main bhai kii hatya ko sharika kehete hai
 Its origin is linked to the participation of others
 dushmano ne bhale donon bhaaiyon ko unki bhavyata ke chalate akasar mughal kaha ho, lekin navaj or shahbaaj aapas main koi aurangzeb or darashikoh jaise nahin hai
 The elder Sharif is still the boss — this is what his brother told me in an interview last week
 jo log chaahate hai ki chijen chalati rahen, unke liye yah ek gambhir samasya ho sakati he
 In early October, Nawaz unexpectedly made his statutory withdrawal — taking a controversial amendment from Parliament to officially take control of the PML-N, making him an important tool to claim his political legitimacy
 Which was rejected by the courts - but more than a dozen cases of corruption are still pending with shere-punjab
 unke or unke parivaar ke khilaaf jaise-jaise dosha saghan hote ja rahe hai, ve ghutane techne ko taiyaar nahin hai
 At the moment they are not going to come to Pakistan so soon
 unhen or maamalon main doshi tehraaya janaa baaki he
 On Monday, he made an unannounced visit to the royal family of his old friend Saudi after which he returned to London (the army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, also made an unannounced visit to Saudi last week about which any details from the military headquarters Not released)
 sharif kaa sajaa paanaa ab pehle se zyada tay dikhataa he or unki kanoonee kismat doobane ke kagaar par he, phir bhi sarkaar ke upar unka niyantran kamjor nahin ho rahaa he
 Even if it costs a heavy price
 is sandarbh main ek or baat kaha janaa jaruri he
 Pakistan's Finance Minister Sharif's wife's brother Ishaq Dar
 daar ko sitambar main bhrashtachar ke aaropon main doshi tehraaya gaya tha or adaalat ne pichley saptahanth unki jaaydaad jabt kar lee
 All this happened when the World Bank was issuing a report raising doubts on the economic stability of Pakistan, IMF was also issuing a warning and the stock market was going into the abyss
 yah chetavanee itani mukhar thi ki fouj ke pramukh general bajva ko bhi ladkadaati arthvyavastha kaa mudda uthaanaa padaa
 Due to all these reasons, the opposition has been forced to demand Dar's resignation due to many reasons, but this has not happened yet, while the finance minister is constantly facing allegations of financial mismanagement of the country
 unki sunwaayee ke jor pakadaaey ke baad se ekaadh maheene ke bheetar hi unka vajan 20 kilo se zyada ghat gaya he jo saaf dikhataa bhi he, phir bhi ve apane rukh par ade hue hai
 Dar's stubbornness can be seen as a symbol of Sharif's stubbornness against the system
 ye donon satta main kisi tarah bane hue hai or phir bhi baagi jaisaa bartaav kar rahe hai
 Saqib Sherani, a former advisor to the government that runs a financial consultancy, says, "it seems that the government is working on a unilateral agenda: protecting the Sharif family from the law by contempting the Constitution
" desh ke saamne khadi baaki chunautiyon—naakaam hoti arthvyavastha, badhata kshetreey or bhu-rajnatik dabaav—kii ore dhyaan hi nahin diya ja rahaa he
 "here Shahbaz himself is charged with murder and hawala
 ye maamle abhi dabe pade hai
 People are saying that they are being given a chance to deliberately set up their house first, take command of their brother, prevent possible confrontation with the establishment and bring things back on track
 aakhirkaarpmail-en ke ek varisht mantri ne naam na likhane kii shart par kaha, ''hamaare teen lakshya hai
 One, we do not want the party to break up or be broken by ISI
 duusare, march main hone vaale seenet ke chunaav tak ham khud ko bachaae rakhana chaahate hai
 Thirdly, we do not want Mian Sahab to be punished
 "in teenon lakshyon main march 2018 kaa seenet chunaav sanvaidhanik rup se bahut nirnaayak he
 If the PML-N government succeeded in this, for the first time after the ninth decade, it would be in control of both the upper and lower houses
 aisa hone ke baad fouj or nyaaypalika ke adhikaron main katautee ke liye sadan kaa kaarykaal khatm hone se pehle kuch sanshodhan paarit kiye ja sakate hai, isse pehle ki agle aam chunaav kaa elaan ho
 Some such serious measures are already under discussion in PML-N circles
 is tarah kah sakate hai ki philhal jo kuch chal rahaa he, uske parinti par pahunchane kii aakhri taarikh march he
 The March elections are not limited to deciding the fate of only a few hundred senators
 ab tak haalanki yah saaf nahin he ki piemail-en march tak kya karegi, kaise karegi or use kaise apni manmarjee karne kii chhot di jaaegi
 Will Nawaz choose to return to Pakistan, go through the whole process and risk going to jail (remember that he is going to be 70 years old soon)? Will Mary stay there and be willing to take the same risk? Will Shahbaz get rid of the shadow of his elder brother to "strike a deal" so that he too does not have to pay the same legal cost? Will the weak but clean-minded Imran Khan-led opposition in legal matters favor any such deal or will it Will take to the streets in protest? Will PML-N be restructured under the leadership of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi who transforms himself from a replacement prime minister into something bigger Will take over — his State Department is balancing the top levels, and in a similar meeting with the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, he dismissed the appointment of Indian government interlocutors for talks with Kashmiri leaders, showing civil-military solidarity
 ghoshnaa ke ghante bhar baad hi yah kadam uthaaya gaya or yah sab ek din ke bheetar hua
 Secondly, if Nawaz's model of protesting while in power does not last and / or there is a crack in the afghan-us-india policy, will the Abbasi technocrats succumb to an easy path for a government of professionals? Or will there be a hidden secret coming out from the political or discrete light? Remember, the judge is the new general today
 videsh mantralay ke ek purv salaahkaar musharraf zadi kehete hai, ''kai staron par karypalika ke kaam main nyaayik hastkshep dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 It enjoys people's trust, partly because there is a lot of power in the issue of political corruption and executive incompetence
 karypalika ke pradarshan ke abhaav main jajon ko unke hastkshepon ke naate zyada vaidhata milti jaaegi
 "this is how the story of Pakistan will continue, even if the incumbent cannot complete its journey
 sab kuch mananeey adaalaton ke insaaf ke hathode par nirbhar karata he

 (PTI) The Popular Front of India (PFI) in Kerala is on the radar of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for its alleged links to terrorism
 india today kii special investigation team ne beete saal apni jaanch main PFI ko benakaab kiya tha
 It also revealed pfi's alleged involvement in activities such as hawala and conversion
 lekin kya ye gaiyr munaafe vaala islamic sanghathan bhavishya main hinduon par hamale ke liye talavaaron kaa jamaavada kar rahaa he? aisa hi kuch aarope soshal media par viral ek post main PFI par lagaaya ja rahaa he
 India Today's viral test team decided to investigate the post warning against PFI on social media
 fasebuk par ‘bhagava diwane’ ke naam se banaae gaye pej par aplod post main likhaa gaya he- “sote raho hinduo, tumhaare khilaaf bheeshan raktapaat kii taiyaari kar rahaa he muslim samudaay
 a large number of arms raids were raided in the PFI jihadists' factory in Kerala from where arms are being sent to mosques, madrasas and Muslim-majority areas across India
 ”post main sandesh ke saath tasviir main jameen par talavaaron or anya dhardaar hathiyaaron ko bikhare dekha ja saktaa he
 Also, they can be seen placed on the grooves
 hamane padtaal ke tahat sabase pehle kerala police kaa rukh kiya
 Anoop VR, an officer of High Tech Crime Inquiry Cell, dismissed the post as completely fake
 anup ne india today kii viral test team ko bataaya ki ‘PFI ke khilaaf aisa koi chapa nahin daalaa gaya jahaan talavaaron ko baraamad kiya gaya ho
 The viral test team also contacted PFI
 sanghathan ke mahasachiv mohammad bashir ne kaha ki is tarah ke kathith soochna muslim sanghathan kii chhavi kharaab karne kii koshish he
 Bashir said, 'this is completely fake
 pehle ye malayalam fasebuk post ke taur par saamne ai thi
 This is another attempt to tarnish the image of our organization
 ’ bashir ke mutabik PFI ne is puure maamle kii jaankaree sibar cell ko di he
 Bashir also shared screenshots of the Malayalam post accusing the PFI of preparing to attack Hindus
 post main likhaa gaya he- ‘SDPI ke hathiyaaron kaa jakhira jabt kiya gaya he
 The police were surprised to see swords loaded in two rooms
 unhone talavaarein banane main istemaal hone vaale kachche maal ko bhi jabt kiya
 Hindus, clever
 police kaa kahana he ki or hathiyaar jabt kiye jaaenge
 SDPI ie Social Democratic Party of India is the political wing of PFI
 viral testase sabit hua ki PFI ko nishaanaa banane vaali post farji he
 Now we have tried to find out what is the original source of the picture linking PFI in a fake way
 viral test ne pataa lagaaya ki ye tasviir punjab ke patiala main sthit sikhon kii kripaan (sikho kaa ek dharmik pratik) banane kii factory ‘khalsa kripaan’ se lee gai he
 Factory owner Bachchan Singh confirmed that the picture showed his warehouse
 bachan singh ne hamaare samvaadadaata ko wo jo jagah bhi dikhaai jahaan ye tasviir lee gai
 When asked who would have taken this picture, Bachchan Singh said that a group of tourists had come to his factory a few years ago
 bachan singh ke bhai shingara singh ne india today ko bataaya, ‘ye store pichley 20 saal se he
 We supply goods all over Punjab
 talavaaron ko sikh dharm main kripaan kaha jaataa he
 In our religion it is used to honor someone in ceremonies
 sikh dharm ke paanch pratikon main shaamil hone kii vajah se amritadhari sikh choti kripaan hameshaa apane saath rakhte hai
 'singh said that to honor our religious leaders, he is given a kirpan
 saath hi melon main bhi inaki adla badali hoti he
 People keep them in their homes and tourists take them along as a memento
 viral test se sabit hua ki PFI ko talwaar factory se jodne vaali post farji hai
 But this does not mean that the Popular Front of India has got a clean chit
 is sanghathan ke ucch padaadhikari india today ke camere par bade paimaane par dharm parivartan kii gatividhiyon or hawala lenden main shaamil hone kii baat kabool karte kaid hue the

 com / 1yv108mz63 — ANI UP (@aninewsup) January 13, 2019 dilli or maharashtra ke baad upi main bhi bijli kii daren kam karne kii maang uth rahi he
 These demands are made by none other than the leaders of the ruling Samajwadi Party
 samaajawaadee party ke mahasachiv or lakhanu loksabhaa seat se party ummidavaar ashok vaajapeyi ne mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko chitthee likhakar upi main bijli kii daron main kami karne kii maang kii he
 Vajpayee says that in UP, such poor people, who use less than 250 units of electricity a month, their rates should be reduced by 25 percent
 haalanki, akhilesh yadav pehle hi yah kah chuke hai ki bijli kii daren kam karne kaa kaam rajya vidyut niamak ayog kaa he
 Vajpayee's demand is being linked with the announcement of the Aam Aadmi Party government of giving cheap electricity in Delhi
 vaajapeyi ko shaayad aisa lag rahaa he ki agar bijli kii daren kam ho jaaen to lakhanu kii seat par unka bedaa paar ho saktaa he
 However, Vajpayee denied that he was the 'kejriwal Effect'
 kitni vaazib he vaajapeyi kii maang?uttar pradesh main bijli ke gramin gharelu upabhoktaaon se rajya sarkaar ko 1800 sau karod rupee kaa rajasav miltaa he jabaki shahari gharelu upabhoktaaon se kareeb 6200 karod rupaya rajasav miltaa he
 If the government provides 25 percent subsidy for rural consumers, then the exchequer will incur a burden of Rs
 450 crores
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki iske alaava agar sarkaar apana ghaataa puraa kar le or bakaayaa vasuul le to bhi bijli kii daren kam kii ja sakati hai
 President of Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Consumers Council, Awadhesh Mishra, says that consumers owe electricity of Rs 29 thousand 325 crore and the loss of electricity department is Rs 26 thousand crore
 agar bakaayaa vasuul liya jaae to bijli vibhaag 3300 karod rupee ke phaayde main aa jaaegi
 With this, there will be no problem in reducing electricity rates by 25 percent
 upi main line loces bhi 26 pratishat he
 If the line loss is reduced by 11 percent by assuming 15 percent of the standard, then the department can benefit by Rs 4000 crore
 usee aadhaar par bhi bijli kii daren kam kii ja sakati hai
 However, the proposal to reduce electricity rates is pending before the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission
 mukhyamantri ne bhi kah diya he ki daren kam karnaa yaa badhanaa vidyut niamak ayog ke haath main hai

 In fact, the Rajasthan High Court termed the religious custom 'santhara' (fasting till death) of the Jains as illegal and punishable under Indian Penal Code 306 and 309

 a Jodhpur court on Wednesday recorded the statement of actor Salman Khan in a case related to the hunting of black deer
 vah shastr adhinium ke tahat mukademe kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 At the same time, Adalat has rejected the plea against Salman to combine the two cases registered under the Arms Act and Wildlife Act
 salmaan ke vakil hastimal saraswat ke anusaar, 'salmaan ne apane bayaan main kaha ki na to vah avaidh hathiyaar rakhte hai or na hi unhone kaale hiran kaa shikaar kiya he
 The court has fixed March 10 for the next hearing of the case
 salmaan ne adaalat main die apane bayaan main kaha ki jodhpur main unke paas koi hathiyaar nahin tha or hathiyaar mumbai main the

 salmaan ne adaalat main yah bhi kaha ki vah shikaar main shaamil nahin the or jaanch adhikari tathaa van adhikari ne unke khilaaf maamla gadha he
 On the other hand, Chief Judicial Magistrate Chandrakala Jain dismissed the actor's plea to add two cases and directed him to continue recording the statement
 salmaan ne adaalat se anurodh kiya tha ki shastr adhinium ke tahat ek maamle ko or 1-2 oktober 1998 kii darmiyaan raat ko kaale hiran ke shikaar se jude duusare maamle ko mila diya jaae
 Salman had argued in his application that the case under the Arms Act has reached the record of record, whereas it has not yet started in the case of hunting in which he allegedly used so-called weapons
 sarkari abhiyojak upendra sharma ne kaha salmaan ne adaalat se guhaar lagaai kii bhavishya kii sunwaayee ke liye donon maamlo ko mila diya jaae or shikaar vaale duusare maamle ko bayaan darj karne ke str tak pahunchane tak pehle maamle main bayaan darj karne par roak lagaai jaae
 Significantly, during the shooting of the film 'hum Saath Saath Hain' in Jodhpur, on the outskirts of Kanakani village, on one and two October 1998, two black deer were allegedly hunted

 And the number of mps increased gradually
 After the completion of the discussion, Rajnath Singh replied, 'it is being tried to spread the illusion that the oppression of Dalits has increased when the BJP government comes

 At around 4 pm, the MP count crossed 100

 But Rajnath's answer was only half that the Congress did a walkout
 aarope lagaaya ki unke sawaalon kaa jawaab nahin mila
 Still speaking in the House, Rajnath completed his statement

 a CBI court in Ranchi has convicted Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Yadav in the fodder scam case
 iske baad unako jail bhej diya gaya he
 Now, the court will announce the punishment and fine on January 3
 lalu yadav kaa jail se purana conection he
 He has not gone to jail for the first time
 isse pehle bhi unako kai baar jail kii hawa khaani padi he
 He has spent 375 days in jail so far
 unke chunaav ladane par pehle hi pratibandh lagaaya ja chukaa he
 In fact, there are 6 different cases of fodder scam on Lalu Prasad
 teen oktober 2013 ko chaara ghotaale se jude ek maamle main lalu ko doshi tehraaya gaya tha
 In this case a scam of Rs 37 crores was revealed
 adaalat ne maamle main lalu yadav ko paanch saal kii jail kii sajaa or 25 lakh rupee kaa jurmaana lagaaya tha
 After this, Lalu Yadav was lodged in Ranchi's Birsa Munda Jail, but in December 2013 he was granted bail by the court
 iske baad lalu yadav ko ranchi kii birsa munda jail se reeha kar diya gaya tha
 In 1996, raids were conducted in the offices of the Department of Animal Husbandry
 is dauraan kuch farji companiyon dwaara paison kii herapheri karne kaa maamla saamne aayaa
 After this, on 11 March 1996, the Patna High Court ordered the CBI to investigate the scam
 saal 1996 main sibiai ne chibasa khajaana maamle main praathmiki darj kii or 23 june 1997 ko sibiai ne aarope patr daayar kiya or lalu prasad yadav ko aaropee banaaya
 On 30 July 1997 Lalu Prasad surrendered in a CBI court

 'according to media reports,' in Bareilly, a woman was divorced twice by her husband and married again
 is dauraan mahila ko do baar nikaah-halaala or iddat kii muddat kaa paalan karnaa padaa
 After the first divorce, the woman was married with her father-in-law and then the second time with her husband's brother
 ''musalamaanon main talaak dene ke baad yadi koi vyakti patni se phir nikaah karnaa chaahati he to mahila ko nikaah-halaala karnaa hota he
 In this, the woman has to marry another man, make a marital relationship, then divorce him
 uske baad use iddat kii muddat puraa kerani hoti he
 "bareilly nikah-halala" Doesn't your conscience shiver? " In a post on Facebook titled, Arun Jaitley wrote, 'unfortunately, when reading this news in the morning newspaper, people should have woken up to their conscience; The president of the All India Congress Committee and his colleagues are promising to withdraw the bill that provides for punishment on triple talaq at the minority conference
 ' yah vidheyak philhal sansad main lambit he
 The Union Minister said that the late Rajiv Gandhi made the biggest mistake of the legislature by reversing the decision of the Supreme Court in the Shah Bano case
 court ne us faisle main sabhi musalmaan mahilaon ko guzaara bhatta kaa adhikaar diya tha
 She further wrote that this pushed the women left by the husband into poverty and deprivation
 ab 32 saal baad unka betaa peeche dhakelne vaala or ek kadam uthaa rahaa he
 Which is not only pushing them towards poverty but is also forcing them to live a life which is against human existence

 During this, PM Modi also spoke openly on the opposition's allegations of not remembering the work of the old governments of the country
 piem modi ne kaha ki ham hameshaa puraani sarkaron ke yogadan ko yaad karte hai, lekin congress ne kabhi puraani sarkaron ke kaam ko yaad nahin kiya
 Giving an example of this, PM Narendra Modi mentioned former Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narasimha Rao
 piem modi ne kaha ki 2004 se 2014 tak upie kii sarkaar rahi or isse pehle atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar rahi, lekin congress ne kabhi atal ji kaa naam sansad main nahin liya
 PM Modi said that even Narasimha Rao's name was not taken during the Congress government
 bataa den ki narsimha raav atal bihari vaajapeyi se pehle congress kii sarkaar ke dauraan desh ke pradhanmantri rahe hai
 PM Modi said that during his (UPA) tenure Narasimha Rao would have received the Bharat Ratna, Manmohan Singh would have received the Bharat Ratna, but there was no person outside the family
 piem modi ne kaha ki hamaari soch alag he or isiilie pranab mukherjee ke liye bharat ratna kaa nirnay kiya gaya
 Not only this, while criticizing the Congress, PM Modi also said that the UPA never mentioned the achievement of Manmohan Singh
 congress par puraani sarkaron kii tarif na karne kaa aarope lagaate hue piem modi ne bataaya ki maine lalakile se do baar aisa kiya or sabakaa naam liya
 He said that i am the first PM who told the Red Fort that all the governments of the Center and the state since independence have contributed to take the country forward
 piem modi ne kaha ki unki apeksha he ki vahi naam aae, yah alag baat he lekin maine hameshaa pichhali sarkaron ko shrey diya he, kisi kaa naam nahin liya he or shaayad isse kisi ko takalif ho sakati he
 PM Modi said that only the family used to get everything in the Congress government
 lekin ham kisi ke yogadan ko nakaarte nahin hai
