 But the former MP and senior state leader Maheshwar Singh, forced to form the Himachal Lokhit Party and suspended Kangra MP Rajan Sushant from the party, is now under the shelter of Shanta Kumar, the arch-rival of Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal
 bhaajapa sutron ke mutabik, mukhyamantri ko spsht kar diya gaya he ki khaas taur se kangra se jude har chote-bade faisle shanta kumaar kii jaankaree or unki sahmati se hi hone chahie
 Apart from this, under the formula of solidarity, he has also decided to pay attention to everything of Shanta
 unki naaraazgi khaas taur se mantriyon kii kaaryastylee ko lekar he
 According to sources, Shanta is also demanding the exclusion of two ministers in the Dhumal government, who have been accused of corruption
 lekin ab tak shanta ko nazarandaaj karne vaale netaa lagaataar unase baatcheet kar naaraazgi khatm karne main jute hai
 The situation in Himachal is exactly like Uttarakhand and the people of the party are blaming the government for all the corruption
 congress ne to baqayada 'himachal on cell' abhiyaan bhi ched rakhaa he
 Although the party will contest the Himachal Assembly elections to be held at the end of the year under Dhumal's leadership, but the work of repairing his house has started in time
 bhaajapa mahasachiv je
 P
 nadda kehete hai, ‘ab koi matbhed nahin he
 We will contest elections under Dhumal's leadership and like Punjab this time, Himachal will be broken

 Soon after the rebellion in the state BJP, National President Nitin Gadkari had sent the report to Nadla and Secretary Sham Jaju only to Shimla
 pradesh ke sabhi netaaon se baatcheet ke baad party ne spasht taur par mahasoos kiya tha ki kisi tatasth vyakti ko adhyaksh kii jimmedaari di jaae, varna uttarakhand ke baad pahaad kii duusari satta se bhi bedakhal hona padegaa
 Taking immediate action on this report, Khimi Ram was removed from the post of state president and made a minister in the government and the responsibility of the state president was entrusted to the MLA Satpal Satti with ABVP background
 mukhyamantri dhumal ke saansad putr anuraag singh thakur kehete hai, ‘vivaadon kii baat ab purana adhyay ban gaya he

 However, Virbhadra is the only option in Himachal after advancing the Brahmin leadership in Uttarakhand
 pahaad main brahman banaam thakur kii raajnneeti kaaphi majbootee se dikhti he, isliye bhaajapa ne maheshwar singh ko waapas bhaajapa main laane ke liye pradesh adhyaksh ko har faisle kaa adhikaar de diya he
 After the historic victory in Punjab, the BJP does not want to take any risk like Uttarakhand, so it is tempting to bring back those who left the party and the rival faction
 lekin sabhi guton ke bich chunaav tak ekajutata ko banaae rakhana party ke liye badi chunauti he

 Ranveer Singh, the general secretary of the Confederation of ex-paramilitary Force Welfare Association, says that if we die then the government will give us pension
 jinda javaanon ko bhi pension do
 Ranveer said that we have told all political parties that if you include the demands of paramilitary forces in your manifesto, then only we will support you or else we will oppose you

 In such a situation, how will this ambitious program of DU VC be successful, on this, all the officials of DU administration are sitting silently
 bhartiya janata party ke 'ballamaar' vidhayak akaash vijayawargeey ko bhale hi jail se zamaanat mil gai ho, lekin unki charchaa abhi bhi har jagah ho rahi he
 If Prime Minister Narendra Modi rebuked the sky in the parliamentary party meeting, its effect has also started showing
 akaash vijayawargeey ab media se bhi duuri bana rahe hai, yahaan tak ki vah apane ghar se bhi baahar nahin aa rahe hai
 He was to attend a meeting on Tuesday, but he kept away from it
 mangalvaar ko akaash vijayawargeey ko indore main bhartiya janata party kii sadsyta abhiyaan samiti kii baithak main hissaa lenaa tha, lekin vah nandanagar sthit ghar se hi neeche nahin aa rahe hai
 Let us know that on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also given a statement on the matter related to Akash and has shown his strictness
 party sutron kii maane to ek hafte main party kii anushaasan samiti kii taraf se akaash vijayawargeey ko kaaran bataao notice jari kiya jayega
 Only after Akash's answer will a decision be taken from the party
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne dikhaai sakhtirajdhani dilli main hui bhartiya janata party kii sansadeey dal kii baithak main piem modi ne akaash vijayawargeey ke balla cond par sakhti dikhaai
 In the meeting, the PM said that anyone should have a son, but should not act like this, they should show the way out of the party
 pradhanmantri kii sakhti yahaan hi nahin rukii, unhone kaha ki jo bhi netaa is tarah ke netaaon kaa samarthan karte hai unhen bhi party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa dena chahie
 The effect of this strictness of PM has also started showing
 bataa den ki 26 june ko jab indore nagar nigam ke adhikari ek jarjar makaan todane pahunche to akaash vijayawargeey ne apane samarthakon ke saath nigam adhikari ke saath badasluki kii
 Not only this, he attacked the officer with the bat and assaulted him

 lalarang kii chamchamati marcedies banj kii ek jhalak ke liye patrakaaro or aam logon ko kai din intazaar karnaa padaa
 Two days before the yatra, the chariot, which was presented to the media, dressed like a bride, responded in its first journey itself
 bade taam-jhaam se jis marcedies banj rath se akhilesh yadav apni yatra lekar nikle the, jis rath ke liye na sirf shubh muhoort tay hua balki vaastu ke hisaab se uske nikalne kii disha bhi tay kii gai
 The chariot that had to fight hard to get Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav to be flagged, the wheel of the chariot did not turn properly yet that it stopped
 akhilesh kii yatra lohia path par aisi rukii ki lakh koshishon ke baavjood ek inch nahin khisak pai
 Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Vikas Yatra took off from the La Martiniere ground in Lucknow on Thursday, Mulayam Singh Yadav flagged it off but the chariot would have barely extended half a kilometer from the La Maartenir ground that it answered
 akhilesh yadav tab thik se is rath main sahaj bhi nahin ho paae the, sirf ek baar hi hadrolic lift kaa istemaal kar paae the vahi haal akhilesh kii patni dimpal yadav kaa bhi tha wo bho abhi rath ke bheetar khud ko sahaj banane kii koshish main thi ki is rath ne dam tod diya
 This chariot built on the Mercedes was so bad that no mechanic could fix it and even after 10 hours, this chariot stood on the road and could not be recovered by any local mechanic
 local ejeeniyar or technical log nahin pakad paye ki aakhir rath ke karaab hone kii vajah kya he
 To correct the chariot, the experts of the Mercedes Company were flown from Lucknow to Lucknow
 mukhyamantri ne bataaya ki iske driver kii vajah se ye rath karaab hua kyonki driver ne hand brake laga kar gaadi chalaa di, jisase is gaadi kii klach plate jal gai or gaadi jahaan rukii to phir ek inch bhi nahin bad pai
 This chariot was not only designed by a Chandigarh company but also designed it, but the driver's mistake made the beginning of the chariot journey a matter of fun
 chandigarh kii ye company pehle bhi 4 aise rath alag-alag partiyon ke liye bana chuki he lekin akhilesh yadav ke rath ne aisi bhad pitwai ki ab shaayad hi koi rath ko itane naaz nakhron se nikaale
 When the Narendra Modi government at the Center announced in its last budget to give Rs 6000 annually to the 12 crore small and marginal farmers of the country under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi, it was considered as the masterstroke of the government before the general elections
 lekin ab congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne nunatam aay yojana yani 'nyaay' ke tahat desh ke sabase garib 25 karod logon kii masik aay 12000 rupee karne kaa elaan kiya he
 The scheme is named 'nyaya', on which a total of 3
 60 lakh karod kharch honge
 Inaugurating the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi from Gorakhpur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that before the election, the Congress Party promises to distribute bailout among farmers in the name of debt waiver
 lekin unki sarkaar desh ke kisaanon ke sammaan main ek saal 75000 karod yani 10 saal main 7
 Will spend 5 lakh crores
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne apni reliyon main nunatam aay kii guarantee kii ghoshnaa karte hue kaha tha ki aisi yojana puri duniya main nahin he
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that under the Prime Minister Kisan Samman Nidhi, the government gives 3 every day to every farmer
 50 rupee de rahi he
 But under the promise which the Congress party is going to make, it aims to raise the monthly income of the poorest 5 crore families in the country i
e
 25 crore people to Rs
 12000
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki upie sarkaar ne manaregaa ke tahat 14 karod logon ko garibi se baahar nikaala
 Now our incoming government will lift 25 crore people out of poverty and this will be the final blow to the poverty of the country

 5
 This amount will be given in 3 installments of 2000 rupees directly to the farmers' account
 congress kii nunatam aay guarantee yojana:1
 The poorest 5 crore families in the country i
e
 25 crore people will get the benefit of the justice scheme
 2
 The minimum income of every person under the scheme is to be Rs 12000 per month
 3
 Meaning if the income of a person is Rs 6000 per month, then the government will give another 6000 rupees to that person on its behalf
 4
 20 percent people of the country will get direct benefit of this scheme
 5
 According to estimates about 3 on this plan
 60 lakh karod kaa kharch aayega

 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 kya aapako is baat se fark padataa he ki koi sarkaar apni sansthaaon ke bich kis tarah kaa santulan banaati he or unki swaittata ko kitni jagah detii he
 i am not talking about CBI
 varisht vakil gopal subramanyam jaj nahin bane to janata ko kyon takalif honi chahie
 Inflation is not reduced by becoming a judge
 yah nivedan isliye he ki isi bahaane karypalika jise hindi main sarkaar kehete hai or nyaaypalika jise urdu main adaalat kehete hai ke bich ek jaj kii niyukti ko lekar jo bahes chal rahi he usamen har kisi ko kud padana chahie
 To understand the delicate relationship between the executive and the judiciary
 tabhi aap yaa ham is baat ko dhang se dekh paaenge ki kya kisi jaj kii niyukti is baat par bhi nirbhar ho sakati he ki sarkaar use raajnneetik najariye se kaise dekhati he
 After all, why did the Chief Justice have to say that the Government of India decided to separate one of the four names sent to him was not fair and did so unilaterally
 bina meri jaankaree or sahmati ke aisa kiya gaya
 After this, the Chief Justice says that do not make the assumption that there can be any compromise with the independence of the judiciary
 maine hameshaa isaki ladaai ladi he or agar samjhauta hua to main kursi chhod dene vaala pehla vyakti hounga
 i promise one billion twenty crore Indians that the independence of the judiciary will not be compromised

 doosraa shabd he segrigation− is shabd kaa istemaal is sandarbh main aayega ki kyon sarkaar ne collegium ke bheje chaar jajon main se ek kaa naam alag kar diya
 Separate means his appointment order was not issued
 maamla yah he ki bharat sarkaar ne gopal subramanyam ke jaj banane ke prastaav kii file segrigate yani alag kar di or baaki teen jajon kii niyukti ko manzuri de di
 He was made a judge in waiting
 gopal subramanyam ne ise apni swatantraaa peshewar saakh eemaandaaree or nishtha par kutharaghaat yani hindi main hamale ke rup main dekha
 He was upset that even after getting a clean chit from the IB on May 15, news of him was leaked to the media as soon as the new government arrived
 in baton ko lekar gopal sahab ne 25 may ko bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko ek chitthee likh di or use saarvajanik kar di
 i have selected some portions of this 9-page letter according to myself
 jisamen gopal aakhir main kehete hai ki pichley kuch hafton main jo kuch hua he usase mere man main gambhir ashanka paidaa hoti he ki sarkaar meri yaa nyaaypalika kii swatantraaa kaa sammaan nahin karegi
 My understanding is that my file was not sent to the collegium for reconsideration
 mujhe lagata he ki nyaaypalika sarkaar kii pasand naapsand kaa aadar kar apni swatantraaa ko lekar adane main naakaam rahi he
 The court should do at least enough to make a statement like expressing confidence in me
 kam se kam apni birdari ke sadasyon ke saath to insaaf hona hi chahie
 If the court is not successful in this, then it will sink into the sand dunes
 28 june ko videsh se lautne ke baad chif justise ne saarvajanik rup se yakeen dilaayaa he ki nyaaypalika kii azaadi se samjhauta nahin hone denge
 Who was interfering in freedom chif justise ne to yah bhi kaha ki bina unki razaamandi yaa jaankaree ke sarkaar ne gopal subramanyam kii file ko alag kiya
 While the collegium chose the best talent
 kya yah jawaab gopal subramanyam ke liye kaaphi he
 The Chief Justice also said that Gopal Subramaniam has not corrected his statement publicly
 6 may ko chaar vyaktiyon ke naam supreme court ke jaj ke liye bheja gaya tha
 But as the government changes, there are reports in the media that the government approved three names and stopped the file of Gopal Subramaniam
 kyonki unke khilaaf ibi or sibiai kii pratikul tippanee he
 Gopal Subramaniam is hurt by this news and approaches the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice asks him to stay until 28 June so that he returns from abroad
 gopal is khat main likhte hai ki agar naam waapas nahin liya ki unke saath ke teen jajon kii niyukti sandigdh ho jaaegi
 They are hurt by this propaganda
 ibi ne mujhe 15 may ko clin chit de di thi
 i am being maligned for raising suspicion in the eyes of the people and the collegium
 agar mujh par shaq tha to supreme court ne kai najuk masalon par mujhe emicas cure kyon banaaya
 You can call amicus curiae a helpful lawyer in Hindi
 ibi or sibiai ne mujhe kyon sheersh vakil banaae rakhaa
 i think the government is targeting due to suggestions in cases like Sohrabuddin vs Government of Gujarat
 gopal ne likhaa he ki sarkaar ko lagata he ki ve unki line par nahin chalenge
 The government summoned sources that it respects the independence of the judiciary
 pehle bhi ummidavaaron ke naam alag kiye gaye hai
 Swatanter Kumar and CK Prasad's name was suggested in 2009 when only Swatanter Kumar was approved
 sutron dwaara prachaarit in udaahranon kii tulana gopal subramanyam maamle se kii ja sakati he yaa nahin yah bhi ek sawaal he
 The file of Justice CK Prasad, cited by government sources, was stopped in December 2009, but the file was sent to the collegium
 collegium apni raay par kaayam rahaa or farvari 2010 main justise sike prasad, supreme court ke jaj ban gaye
 Justice CK Prasad is today a member of the same collegium that elected Gopal Subramaniam
 kya sarkaar ne chif justise yaa collegium se koi raay maangi thi kya sarkaar ne raajnneetik kaarnon se kisi ko jaj banane se roak kar nyaaypalika kii azaadi main dakhlandaazi kii he
 Gopal withdrew the name, but the questions that have been left out can also be withdrawn

 At that time, the lawyers refused to advocate for him
 ramchandran kehete hai, “kisi kii pairvi na karne ke sambandh main vakeelon ko koi naitik kadam nahin uthaanaa chahie

 chaara ghotaalaa maamle main (fodder Scam) main jail main band rajd pramukh lalu prasad yadav ko supreme court se ek or bada jhatka laga he
 The Supreme Court has rejected the bail plea of lalu Prasad Yadav
 lalu prasad yadav ke liye supreme court kaa yah faisla isliye bhi sabase bada jhatka he kyonki 1977 ke baad aisa pehali baar hoga ki lalu prasad yadav kisi bhi chunaav prachaar main shaamil nahin honge
 This means that this is the first time since 1977 that Lalu Prasad Yadav will not participate in the election campaign
 bataa den ki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2015 main bihar vidhansabha chunaav main apni party ke liye lalu prasad ne prachaar kiya tha, haalanki, us vakt bhi vah jail se jamaanat par baahar aae the
 Actually, Lalu Prasad Yadav had sought bail from the court citing health
 magar sibiai (CBI) ne supreme court main halafanama pesh karke lalu prasad yadav kii jamaanat yachika kaa virodh kiya tha
 The CBI had said that Lalu Yadav is seeking bail for the Lok Sabha Election
 supreme court ke jajment ke baad kai chijen nai hongi
 For example, after 1977 when Lalu Prasad Yadav contested for the first time and was elected as an MP from Saran, he would not be able to campaign
 chaara ghotaalaa main fanse hone kii vajah se unhen ayogy tehra diya gaya tha, jisaki vajah se vah chunaav nahin lard sake the, magar vah 2014 ke chunaav or 15 ke vidhansabha chunaav main apni party ke prachaar prasar main shaamil hue the
 It is so inferior that unless Lalu Prasad Yadav was found guilty in a special CBI court in the fodder scam case, it is very difficult for Lalu Prasad Yadav to get out of jail
 bataa den ki lalu prasad ko nau sau karod rupe se adhik ke chaara ghotaale se sambandhit teen maamalon main doshi tehraaya ja chukaa he
 These cases relate to the fraudulent withdrawal of money from the treasury department of Animal Husbandry in the 1990s, when Jharkhand was part of Bihar
 lalu prasad ne ucch nyaayalay main jamaanat ke liye apni umr or girte swasthya kaa hawala dete huye kaha tha ki vah madhumeh, raktchaap or kai anya bimariyon se jujh rahe hai or unhen chaara ghotaale se sambandhit ek maamle main pehle hi jamaanat mil gayi thi

 The nutrient that gives tomato a red color can increase fertility in men
 ek adhyayan main is baat kaa khulaasa hua he
 Man's pain research has shown that lycopene (tomato is red due to lycopene) can increase the sperm count by up to 70%
 is avishkaar se ab un purushon kii madad ho paaegi jo pita nahin ban paa rahe hai
 a large group that helps infertile men now wants to do a survey to see if giving more lycopene to men increases their chances of becoming a father
 britain ke intertile network ke pravaktaa karren veness ke mutabik, 'ham research ke parinaamon ko kaaphi sakaaratmak rup se le rahe hai
 And now we want to see a study to see if lycopene can help men '
 unhone kaha, 'hamaare samaaj main banjhapan ko mahilaon se jodakar dekha jaataa he kyonki mahilaayein hi baccha paidaa karti hai, lekin zyaadaatar maamalon main sperm ke function yaa quality kii vajah se mahilaayein pregnent nahin ho paatin'
 Let me tell you that this report is from the Cleveland Clinic of Ohio, whose review has so far been done by 12 different groups around the world
 sabhi ke rivyuu main yah baat saamne ai ki licopine sperm count ke saath sperm kii speed ko bhi badhaata he
 Not only this, lycopene is also helpful in reducing bad sperm
 isse pehle hue duusare adhyayanon se pataa chalaa tha ki licopine prostate se judi bimariyon ko kam karata he
 Let me tell you that the prostate is a gland that makes sperm
 is research ko karwaane vaale cleveland clinics ke diarector ashok agarwal kii team ne infertility se jujh rahe kuch purushon ko licopine supplements dene shuru bhi kar die hai, jiske parinaamon kii ghoshnaa agle saal tak kii ja sakati he

 According to the provisions of the proposed draft, it is the priority of both countries to stop the business of fake currency

 In the documents held till date, it is clearly written that India and America are preparing to stop the supply of note printing paper, ink and machine to the countries involved in the business of counterfeit notes
 don daaud ibrahim iesai kii madad se nepal, bangladesh, srilanka, thailand or khadi deshon ke jariye nakli note bharat pahunchaata he
 It has become the biggest source of funding for anti-india terrorist organizations
 bharat kii tamaam koshishon ke baavjood pakistan kii sarazmi par baitha aatank kaa ye aakaa apni harkaton se baj nahin aa rahaa he
 Intelligence agencies believe that Dawood Ibrahim, who lives in Karachi, has linked his people living in Dubai and Morocco to this business to print fake Indian notes and send them to India
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik daaud ibrahim pakistan kii un printing preson main nakli bhartiya note chhapavata jahaan pakistani note chhapate hai
 All this is done to preserve the quality of fake notes

 After a poor performance in the last series, Jeetu sat in a state of despair on the back chair
 shaayad apane pradarshan par hi hairaan the ki aakhri ke teen shot ne unhen kaise final kii res se baahar kar diya tha
 National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) President Raninder Singh expressed surprise at the victory of Jitu
 raninder ne kaha ki unhone jitu ko itnaa kharaab pradarshan karte kabhi nahin dekha, kam se kam beete teen varshon main to nahin hi
 Raninder said, "I was absolutely shocked
 mujhe samaj main nahin aa rahaa ki kya kahuun
 i have never seen Jeetu take such a bad shot in the last moments before
 shaayad vah hawa kii gati or disha ko samajhane main puri tarah asafal rahe

 is bich unhone nau baar bich-bich nishaanaa lagaaya or puure ank hasil kiye
 But his performance in the sixth series was disappointing and he slipped to 12th place scoring 88
 It is noteworthy that Jitu had not scored 88 so low in any level competition before
 aakhri siries main kharaab pradarshan kar jitu peeche rakhi kursi par niraashaa kii haalat main baith gaye

 Raninder said that he had never seen Jeetu perform so poorly, at least not in the last three years
 raninder ne kaha, "main bilkul hairaan rah gaya
 i do not understand what to say
 maine jitu ko isse pehle aakhri kshanon main itnaa kharaab shot lagaate kabhi nahin dekha
 Perhaps he completely failed to understand the wind speed and direction
 main samaj saktaa hum ki aapkaa koi ek shot kharaab chalaa jaae
 But three shots? This is an extremely poor performance
 isse pehle anya pratiyogitaaon main usne shandaar pradarshan kiye hai
 "comments antarrashtriya nishanebaaji khel mahasang kii kaaryakari samiti ke sadsy raninder ne rio main jitu or abhinav bindra kaa safar khatm hone par dukh vyakt kiya
 It is noteworthy that Bindra, who gave India the only individual gold medal in the Olympics, finished fourth in the final of the 10 meter air rifle event on Monday and missed the medal
 raninder ne kaha, "bindra or raay olympic main padak ke hamaare do sabase prabal daavedaar the
 Both have disappointed
 unke haath se padak ko phisalata dekhnaa dukhad he
 While Bindra missed out on getting so close to the medal, Jeetu missed the opportunity because of the last three shots

 Two married sisters were married on Sunday in Bishera village of Dadri
 15 din tak dadri ko jis sampradayik chashme se dekha ja rahaa tha, is shaadi ke saath hi vah chashma tut gaya
 This marriage with pompousness returned the charm of the village
 bisaheda gaanv main dardaka kuhasaa chantane kii shuruyaat ho gai
 The village had a marriage of silk and olives
 kise andaja tha ki 28 sitambar kii ek ghatana gaanv par aisa manahuus saaya daalegi ki duniya kii najar main gaanv mahajab kii talwaar se cat jayega
 But the marriage of silk and olives, then Raunak returned and trust in the village

 One bridegroom hails from the nearby village of Paiyawali, and the other from Sadullahpur
 donon duulhon ke ghar shaadi kii puri taiyaari hui
 Relatives were happy, but until four days ago it was not decided whether marriage will be done in Bashera or not
 gaanvvaalon ke liye yah shaadi mahaj shaadi nahin rahi
 It was a better chance to wash the spots named after the village
 yah shaadi dashahtgardon or siyasadaanon ko ek paigaam thi
 For politicians, the marriage of Sabkareshma and Olive was not important only because of the communal tension in Bashera
 darasal, ye shaadi isliye ahm thi, kyonki is shaadi ko dhoomdhaam se karaane kaa bidaa hindu pariwaron ne uthaaya
 Marriage became an example of communal harmony
 ek lihaaj se un dashahtgardon orasiyasatdanon ke liye sabakabhi ki samaaj ko baantne kii unki koshishen kaamyaab nahin ho saktin
 Non-provision of non-veg Buffet for marriage, all dishes like rasgulla, butter cheese, jalebi, rice, chickpeas, chapattis were made, then Mohammad Hakeem gave the responsibility to the Hindu friend to make it
 hinduon kii samvednaa ko thes na pahunche, isliye nonvej kaa intjaam nahin kiya gaya
 The ganges-jamni Tehzeeb Strengthened In fact, the marriage in Bishera strengthened the wire of the ganga-jamni Tehzeeb, where Hindus and Muslims are apart from just remembering God, or else live and eat together
 siyasat ne bisaheda kii bisaat par hindu-musalamaanon ko mohara bana diya, lekin gaanv ke hindu-musalamaanon ne us ummid ko phir jila diya, jisamen kisi shaks kii hatya, puri gaanv kii insaaniyat kii hatya nahin kar sakati

 Happy friendship day 2019: Friendship day is celebrated every year on the first Sunday of August
 is baar friendship de 4 agast ko manaaya jayega
 There is often a turn in life when you feel the need of a friend
 aisa dost, jiske saamne aap apana dil kholkar rakh saken
 One who understands you more than you, who does not need to think before saying anything
 par kya vaaki aaj ke jamaane main aise dost hote hai
 In search of such a friend, nowadays youth reach on social media
 par kya vaaki online dosti kaa yah chalan aapke liye surakshit he
 Is it right to blindly believe such a friend? Let us try to answer all these questions with some suggestions
 aaie jaanate hai online dosti karte samay dhokhe se bachane ke liye koun se upaay apnaane chahie
 -while making friends online, keep in mind that it is absolutely wrong to leave your friends and talk to friends online or stay online in the vicinity
 aisa karne se aap na sirf apana keemtee samay kharaab karenge balki bhaavnaatmak rup se bhi dhokhaa khaane ke liye khud ko taiyaar karenge
 The second rule of online friendship is that do not forget to share every secret of your life with friends on social media instead of your friends
 jaruri nahin ki aap apane jivan kii har baat usase share karen
 It is not right to say every secret when asked by an online friend
 bhale hi aap kitne bhi disturb kyon naa hon
 When the time comes, your new friend can take advantage of you
 – aksar dekha jaataa he ki log ek duusare ko jane bina hi video chating, photose share karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 Not necessarily what the person in front of you is telling you about yourself should also be true
 yaad rakhen soshal media par aap jo data share karte hai wo soshal plateform par share hota he
 Do not make the mistake of fulfilling any demand that you do not feel right
 bhavishya main ye cheez aapke liye khatra ban sakati he
 Many times people try to win their trust by telling their sad story to others
 aisa na ho ki aap bhi apane is online dost kaa koi dukh sunakar itane vyathit ho jaaen ki unki madad ke liye koi bi kadam uthaane kaa faisla kar len
 Nowadays people create many stories and commit online crimes
 aise main aapkaa satark rahanaa aapako surakshit banaae rakh saktaa he

 Being in London, he could not attend the farewell ceremony of former India captain and his long-time teammate Rahul Dravid held in Mumbai on Tuesday
 janat dal-united (jedy-you) or nitish kumaar se haath milaane ke baad jab aisa laga ki rashtriya janata dal (argedy) ko bihar main kuch siasisans milane lagi he, tabhi saansad rajesh ranjan urf pappu yadav ne party or gathbandhan par argedy pramukh lalu prasad yadav ke niyantran ne sawalia nishaan khadaa kar diya he
 Pappu, one of the four RJD mps in the Lok Sabha, has advised his party president to 'improve his way' or else the party will not be relevant
 unhone badi nafasat se waar kiya he or lalu ko yah salaah di he ki ve party main maukaparaston par bharosa karnaa band karen
 From accusing both Lalu's sons Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav of 'abusive behavior' towards senior party leaders, Pappu's scathing letters within the party questioned his daughter Misa Bharti and sons for being rjd's star campaigner Has stirred up dissent
 haalanki pappu yadav ne donon chitthiyon main lalu ke adhikaar ko chunauti dene se bachane kii koshish kii he, phir bhi lagata he, unhone lalu kii viraasat par unke bacchon kii daavedaari par sawaal uthaaya he
 The RJD, like any party, has crushed opposition in the party against its leadership
 argedy main rahane kii ummid karne vaala vyakti lalu ko chunauti dene yaa unke parivaar par sawaal uthaane kii himmat nahin kar saktaa
 But Pappu has done both these things
 phir bhi argedy ne madhepura se is saansad par ab tak chaabuk nahin chalaai he
 Looks like Lalu is not completely disappointed with Pappu or does not want to take any step yet
 pappu ne pehali chitthee loksabhaa chunaav ke kuch din baad likhi thi or duusari november 2014 main
 However, they have not received any reply till now
 chitthiyon main chaahe jo bhi likhaa ho, paaramparik siyaasi paridrishy main chitthee likhnaa asahmati or duusari jagah udaan bharne kii taiyaari mana jaataa he
 Senior socialist leader Shivanand Tiwari started a rebellion against the leadership of Lalu or Nitish by writing a letter
 abhi jayanti natarajan ne bhi congress chhodie se pehle sonia gandhi ko ek chitthee likhi he
 Are Pappu's eyes on the cream bowl outside the RJD too? After joining hands with the RJD JD (U) in five consecutive elections, two assembly elections in 2005 and 2010 assembly elections and 2009 and 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 Looks very powerful
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main jedy (you) ke saansadon kii sankhya 20 se ghatakar do rah jane par nitish ko bhi baisakhiyon kii talash thi
 Lalu and Nitish have forgotten two decades of bitterness to deal with the BJP ahead of the scheduled assembly elections in October
 isse pehle jedy (you)-bijepi gathbandhan ke saamne lalu ko chunaavon main haar mili par argedy kaa vot fisadi hameshaa unhen daud main banaae rakhata tha
 Even in the 2010 assembly elections, when the RJD got the lowest 22 seats and could not even get 10 per cent of the seats in the 243-member house, it still had 18
 84 fisadi yani 54 lakh se zyada vot mili the
 This number was good but not enough to take on the BJP-JD (U) impenetrable-looking alliance
 bijepi or jedy (you) main algaav hone se ummid jaagi ki loksabhaa chunaav main lalu kaa bhagya palat saktaa he, par aisa nahin hua
 The bjp-led NDA got 31 seats, Lalu had four and Nitish had only two to satisfy
 ab nitish-lalu ke saath aane se ummid he ki bhagava aandhi ke saamne ye kshetreey sultan tike rahenge
 In the assembly byelections held on 10 seats in August 2014, the lalu-nitish alliance won 6 seats in alliance with the Congress and the BJP won only four seats
 lekin pappu ne adangha laga diya he
 He is waving his freedom at a time when lalu-nitish are busy building a strong front in front of the BJP
 donon jaanate hai ki agar chunaav nattejey unke paksh main nahin rahe to unke shandaar siyaasi jivan kaa patakshep ho jayega
 Before this do or die election, both of them are focused on strengthening their grip
 par pappu kaa maun vidroh unki jaan sokh rahaa he
 Pappu attacked 66-year-old Lalu at such a delicate time when he would now be thinking of declaring any of his children as heirs after undergoing a heart operation last year
 chaara ghotaale main doshi siddh hone ke kaaran ve chunaav nahin lard sakate
 Everyone's eyes are on who they will choose in their place
 pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav haar chuki unki beti, bade bete tej or chote bete tejasvi teenon is daud main bataae jate hai
 But Lalu's decision to hand over leadership to his children has been questioned by Pappu
 isse party main satta hastantaran kii chamak feeki pad sakati he
 Pappu is well aware that the party in which Lalu's order lasts, he cannot get caught
 lekin unhen mauka dikhaai de rahaa he ki ve taadaad main bade yadav samudaay ke siyaasi pratik ban sakate hai or aane vaale daur main gine-chune jilon main hi sahi, saamaajik nyaay ke nae maseehaa kaa rup le sakate hai
 He has increased his stature in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 jab narendra modi ke bavandar ne nitish-lalu ko dhul chataa bihar ko fatah kiya tab bhi pappu or ranjit ranjan (congress) kii jodi ne loksabhaa main nirvaachit ekmaatr dampati kaa khitaab hasil kiya
 This is not a small achievement
 lalu ko party ke bheetar sulagati chinagaari ko bujhaana hoga kyonki party ke kuch log chori-chhipe pappu ke tarkon ko hawa de rahe hai
 By the way, even after being a five-time MP, Pappu's influence is seen to be limited to the kosi-seemanchal area of north Bihar
 ve teen baar purniya or do baar madhepura se jite hai
 For the first time in the political life of three decades, Pappu has achieved such a position that he has some control in the state
 is baar saansad banane ke turant baad unke badhate rutabe kaa asar dikhaai diya, jab unhone rajya ke doctoron ko garib marijon kii jaanch yaa ilaaj ke liye fees kam karne kaa aadesh diya
 On not doing so, he warned of agitation
 is chetavanee ne gujarey jamaane ke us bahubali kii yaad dilaai jisane ajit sarkaar hatyakand main may 2013 main patna hycourt se bari hone ke baad loksabhaa chunaav ladaa tha
 Pappu has done another clever trick
 ve jeethanram maanjhi ke kattar samarthak ho gaye hai, jabaki samajha ja rahaa he ki lalu kaaphi had tak maanjhi ko hataane par raji hai taaki jedy (you) ke kai netaaon kii chahat ke mutabik nitish mukhyamantri kii gaddi par phir asin ho jaaen
 Pappu told India Today, "people demanding the removal of Jitanram Manjhi are irresponsible
 unhen jarur kuch bade netaaon kii shah hogi
 Otherwise, they did not dare to say what they wanted to say
 vidhansabha chunaav hone tak maanjhi ji ko mukhyamantri rahane dena chahie'' lagata he, maanjhi ke samarthan ke peeche pappu kaa iraadaa anusuchit jatiyon or yadavon ko lamaband karnaa he
 It may be that after being removed from the post, Manjhi will try to show himself traumatized and if he joins Pappu, his bid in Bihar may increase after the assembly elections

 He taught me to see the world from a different perspective
 unhone mujhe hameshaa vahi karne ke liye protsaahit kiya gaya jisase mujhe kushi mili or main sikhte hue badi hoti rahun
 She retired as a teacher and after retiring, has started learning to paint

 One thing that i have learned from my mother who has helped me in grooming my personality is that there is no other way than truth, honesty and hard work
 duusari baat, jo unhone mujhe sikhaai wo he ki apni thali main ann kaa ek bhi dana mat chodo, khaanaa barbaad mat karo or jo kuch bhi tumhen parosa gaya he, use puraa khao
 Even at this stage of my life, i am still following his lessons and will continue to do so

 maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke pramukh raaj thakare ek baar phir raajnneetik dalon ke nishane par hai
 The reason for his criticism this time is his remarks against Biharis, in which Thackeray called him an intruder
 congress mahasachiv digvijay singh ne kaha ki thakare parivaar khud bihar kaa rahane vaala he
 From there, they settled in Dhar district of western Madhya Pradesh and then shifted to Mumbai
 singh ne kaha, agar aap mumbai kaa itihaas dekhenge to paaenge ki yah machuaaron kaa shahar he
 The rest of the people living here have come from outside
 thakare ne shuukravaar ko dhamkee di thi ki sthaneey pulicekarmiyon ko suchit kiye bina ek kishor ko bihar se giraftaar karne vaale mumbai police ke karmiyon ke khilaaf yadi bihar sarkaar ke adhikari karrwai karte hai, to maharashtra se bihariyon ko jabaran nikaal diya jayega
 Raj Thackeray was reacting to the news that Bihar Chief Secretary Naveen Kumar had written a letter to the Mumbai Police Commissioner expressing his displeasure over the arrest of a youth who had allegedly vandalized the martyr memorial during the protest at Azad Maidan on 11 August
 bihar main sattarudh jediu ke varisht netaa shivanand tiwari ne is mudde ko lekar congress par naaraazgi jaahir karte hue kaha ki centre or maharashtra main sattarudh party raaj thakare ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar rahi he
 Tiwari compared this development to the rise of Janrail Singh Bhindranwale in the days of terrorism in Punjab
 unhone kaha, yah (raaj thakare kaa aacharan) sanvaidhanik prabhutv ko chunauti he
 At the Azad Maidan in Mumbai, Thackeray said that the Commissioner of Police should be transferred and the same happened after that
 kya maharashtra kii congress nit sarkaar yah jataana chaahati he ki thakare sarkaar se upar hai? Tiwari said, "I will request the Central and Congress-led governments of Maharashtra to take lessons from the experiences in Punjab where they encouraged Bhindranwale
" vah samvidhan se itar praadhikaar bana kar use majboot kar rahe hai
 The time will come when these forces will destroy them like Bhasmasura
 jediu netaa ne kaha ki niyam yah he ki jab bhi kisi ek rajya kii police kisi ko giraftaar karne ke liye duusare rajya main jaati he, to use sthaneey police ko soochna deni hoti he or phir giraftaar vyakti ko sthaneey adaalat main pesh karnaa padataa he, jahaan use transit remand milane ke baad hi anyatra le jaaya ja saktaa he
 The comments bihar sarkaar ke ek mantri giriraaj singh ne thakare kii tippanee ke liye unki aalochana kii or unke khilaaf rajdroh kaa maamla darj karne kii maang kii he
 Singh said, it is against democracy
 thakare ke khilaaf rajdroh kaa maamla darj kiya janaa chahie
 i will also appeal to Anna Hazare from Maharashtra that he should raise his voice against Thackeray

 One was Budhuram, one day he had to go to the market from his village
 to ve apane ghode par savaar hue, bete ko saath bithaaya, anaaj kii bori laadi, or chal pade shahar kii ore
 Some people had gone so far that a villager interrupted - oh brother! Have some mercy on the poor horse khud bhi savaar ho, bete ko bhi bitha rakhaa he or upar se, bori bhi lad rakhi he
 Budhuram blushed
 ghode kii peeth par baithe-baithe unhone chupchaap, bete ko ghode kii peeth se uthaakar apni god main le liya
 Few had gone far when another villager saw that Budhuram was going on horseback, carrying his son in his lap
 usne poocha- buddhuraam ye kya? buddhuraam ne samajhaayaa ki ghode par zyada boj nahin pade isliye unhone bachche ko god main le liya he
 The villager laughed and said - Buddharam, but the sack is heavier than the child
 use bhi to tumne ghode par lad rakhaa he
 Buddharam got into thinking
 aakhirkaar, unhone bori ko apane sir par daalaa, bachche ko god main uthaaya or ghode par savaar hokar aage bad gaye
 Then you will say that his name is Budhuram !! But believe me, many of us, too, continue to work like this every day
 ham bhul jate hai ki hamaare phone or conmputer main, 'google search' naam kaa ek aisa jinn baitha hua he jo ek ishaare par, palak jhapakate hi, kuch bhi hajir kar saktaa he
 Your phone is Aladdin's lamp Your mobile phone equipped with internet is no less than Aladdin's lamp
 lekin phone ke is jinn kii chhipi hui kai takaton ko ham nahin pahchaan pate
 The result is that without downloading a lot of apps, we make our phone sluggish or we keep wandering on all the websites for a little work
 jo kaam pal bhar main ho saktaa he uske liye ham der tak maathapai karte rahete hai
 Just place the 'google Search' icon or widget on your phone's home page
 iske baad google search naam ke is 'jinn' kaa kamaal dekhte jaaen
 Let us tell you about some hidden forces of this genie of Google search
 Google ko search mat karokya aap apane computer main Chrome Browser istemaal karte hai? jinako pataa he unhen ye baat bachakaani lag sakati he
 But a lot of people still go to the first browser to search Google
 com tip karte hai, google kaa pej khulne ke baad usamen jo khojna ho, wo likhte hai, or phir search karte hai
 This is super hard work! Chrome Browser itself is a Google search
 yani google kii site kholane ke bajaay aap sidhe jo search karnaa ho wo yahaan likhen or Enter kaa batan dabaaen
 Google search is hidden within Chrome
 yani agar aap Chrome me aajtak
 If you type com, it will open the website of 'aaj Tak' and if you search just by typing aajtak then it will search aajtak by searching on Google
 Spelling Mistake chalegagoogle search ke liye likhte hue capital or small letters ke bare main sochane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 You search by typing IIT Kanpur or iit kanpur - it is the same
 isi tarah, chote moti spelling kii gadabad ko google, khud sahi kar letaa he
 Do not get upset if you do not remember the spell properly
 kyon chahie calculatorgoogle search ke bheetar kitna powerful calculator chipa he, aap soch bhi nahin sakate
 Those whose hands are tight in maths, if they are asked by giving calculator, 23 of 34962
 5 percent kitna hoga, to shaayad mushkil ho jaaegi
 But just try typing in Google search 23
 5 percent of 34962 
 Google search is the biggest calculator
 jo jodna, ghataana, calculate karnaa ho, sidhe yaheen likhen (jaise 785+456+1386+1654) or jawaab saamne hoga
 There is no need to even think what button to press to calculate what
 bas, sidhe apana sawaal google search main likhen jaise- square root of 45689
 Try and try - the calculator will be forgotten forever
 dollar bataao, rupee paodollar kaa rate to har roj badalata rahata he - kahaan tak yaad rakhaa jaae ! meter ko feet main badalanaa ho, inch ko centimetre main yaa phir dollar ko rupe main - kisi bhi conversion ke liye ab koi App downlod karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Just remember the method - (unit 1) in (unit 2)
 yani google search main sidhe likhen - 175 meter in feet
 Or type 265 dollar in rupee, or 127 centimeter in inch
 he naa aasaan?sweater rakhen yaa nahinchuttiyon main singapore ja rahe hai or uljhan main hai ki garm kapadon kii jarurat padegi yaa nahin? google search main tip karen - weather in singapore - sirf aaj kaa nahin, singapore main agle saat dinon ke mausam kaa haal aapke saamne hoga
 There is no need to find any weather information site now
 bas weather in (shahar kaa naam) likhen or sabakuch saamne hoga
 Such as weather in ahmedabad, weather in london, weather in mumbai
 bhaago nahin, aaraam se!!sardiyon main flites kaa let hona aam baat he
 But there is no need to call the helpline of the airlines again and again
 bas apane phone ke google search main flite kaa naam or number ( jaise spicejet 131, air india 19, british airways 142 ) likh kar search karen
 You will not only get information about flight position, delay, take off and landing time, terminal, you will also know where the plane is at the moment
 landan main raat abhi baaki havidesh main rahane vaale apane rishtedaar ko phone karne se pehle ab ye sochane kii jarurat nahin ki pataa nahin, vahaan is samay kya time ho rahaa hoga
 There is no need to set the time of all the cities of the world in your phone
 bas google search main puuchhie - time in london, time in dubai, time in tokyo
 Along with time, you will also know the time zone of that place
 First de, First stygar aap filmon ke shaukin hai to chuttee ke din sabase pehle ye jaananaa pasand karenge ki ghar ke aas paas ke theatres main aapaki pasandida film ke sho timming kya hai
 Do a search by simply inserting the name of your movie in Google search
 pehla rigelt jo dikhegaa wo hoga aapke aas-paas, kis-kis theatre main us film kaa sho time kya hai
 But it is important that your phone or computer is connected to wi-fi or you have turned on Location Services on your phone
 kisi or jagah par film kaa sho pataa karnaa ho to film ke naam ke saath us ilaake kaa naam or shahar bhi likhen - jaise jackpot noida sector 18
 If you search only by writing showtimes, then you will get the complete details of which film is going on in the nearby theaters
 c - a -T cat - cat maane billiphone main koi Dictionary downlod karne kii jarurat nahin he
 To know the meaning of the word, just type in Google search - define (your word)
 jaise, define hormone, define missile, define adjective
 Not only will you know the meaning of the word, but its definition, method of use, how the word was born and even its correct pronunciation will be seen and heard
 sunne ke liye shabd ke neeche jo spikar kaa nishaan ban kar aata he use clic karen
 And says in Punjabi
 
 
 kya aap kisi duusare bhashaa bolne vaale ko uski bhashaa main kuch likhakar impress karnaa chaahate hai? google search main likhie- translate ( apni bhashaa ke shabd) to ( duusari bhashaa kaa naam) 
 Like translate i love you to tamil
 yaa likhie, translate thank you so much to french
 If you want to use whatever you see before writing in another language, then copy and paste it wherever you want
 mogambo khush huamogambo tabhi khush hoga jab use bilkul vahi milegaa jo chahie
 If you want to find exactly the words you have written - and nothing else - then invert coma ie your words before you press the Enter button to search
 
 
 
 
 
 
 " ke bheetar band kar den
 Similar words will be removed from the search result, and Google will only search your written words and present them to you
 jaise agar aap google main arvind kejriwal IIT likh kar search karengen to aapke saamne 'arvind kejariwal' or 'IIT' in donon shabdon se juden lakhon rigelt aa jaaenge
 But if you close these three words within inverted coma and search for "arvind kejriwal iit", then you will see only the results which will be related to both Arvind Kejriwal and IIT
 jaise arvind kejariwal kis IIT se padhe, unki koun si branch thi, kab paas hue, kya rank thi or arvind kejariwal ke IIT main die gaye bhaashan jaisi chijen
 This trick is especially effective for finding the lyrics of a song, or a famous line of literature
 yahi to thi wo jagahapako yaad he ki pichley hafte aapane Rediff
 com had read an article in which Narendra Modi was compared to Sachin Tendulkar
 aapako website to yaad he, lekin article kaa naam nahin
 Now if you want to send the same article to a friend, why not just rediff
 com par hi use khoja jaae
 For search, write narendra modi sachin tendulkar: rediff
 com
 That is, after the words written for the search, if you write a website name with a space (:) - like tech it easy: aajtak
 com to google sabase pehle usee website ke bheetar un shabdon ko khojkar aapke saamne pesh karegaa
 Not only this, if you wish, Google will search only on specific websites

 a post on social media has been going viral ever since Home Minister Amit Shah's statement on Veer Savarkar
 postmen likhaa ja rahaa he ki 'amit shah ne kaha 1857 kii kranti saavarkar ke bina sambhav nahin thi' jabaki post main yah bhi daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki asal main saavarkar kaa to janm hi 1883 main hua tha
 India Today's anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found in the investigation that the claim being viral is misleading
 amit shah kaa puraa bayaan sunne par samajha ja saktaa he ki unhone yah baat kis sandarbh main kahi thi
 However, the claim is true that Savarkar was born in 1883
 post kaa archivd varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 Facebook user 'rashid Bhai Pardesi' posted this post in which Amit Shah's picture was written: 'amit Shah said 1857 revolution was not possible without Savarkar', while Savarkar's picture was written with: 'truth: Savarkar Was born in 1883
 'viral post main kiye ja rahe daawey kaa sach jaanane ke liye sabase pehle hamane amit shah ke bhaashan ko suna
 Shah recently went to Varanasi, where he said in his speech: 'we have not even tried to cherish the sacrifices of the Sikh Gurus in history, we have referenced a long story of Maharana Pratap's struggle and the struggle before the Mughals
 Did not convert to
 shaayad vir saavarkar na hote to san 1857 kii kranti bhi itihaas na banati, use bhi ham angrejon kii drushti se hi dekhte
 It was Veer Savarkar who made the revolution of 1857 the name of the first freedom struggle
 aaj bhi varna hamaare bachche usko viplav ke naam se jaanate
 'this part of Shah's speech can be heard here
 shah ke bhaashanko puraa sunne par yah samajha ja saktaa he ki ve 1857 kii kranti ke liye saavarkar ko shrey nahin de rahe the, balki is kranti ko 'bharat kaa pehla swatantraaa sangram' kaa naam dene ke liye unhen shrey de rahe the
 Historian Dr Pravesh Kumar told 'aaj Tak' that what Amit Shah has said in his speech is correct
 vir saavarkar hi pehle vyakti the jinhone bade str par 1857 ke sangharsh ko bharat kaa pehla swatantraaa sangram bataaya tha
 Through his book 'the Indian War of Independence', he had told that this struggle was not only about the soldiers, it also included a large number of people
 yah kitaab 1909 main prakashit hui thi
 However, some historians do not believe that credit should be given to Veer Savarkar
 itihaaskaar said irfan habib kaa kahana he ki itihaas main yah zikr kahin nahin he ki kisne sabase pehle yah baat kahi thi
 How can it be said that Veer Savarkar was the first person to name the struggle of 1857 as the first freedom struggle
 aise main yah bahes kaa vishay he ki 1857 ke revolt ko pehla swatantraaa sangram kaa naam dene vaale vir saavarkar hi vah pehle vyakti the yaa nahin
 However, it becomes clear in the investigation that confusion is being spread by using the incomplete statement of Amit Shah

 On Dhanteras, there is about 40 tonnes of gold purchases every year
 Gold imports have come down to 26 tonnes in September, so there is a lot of buying of gold and silver in the festive season, but this time there is no such hope

 Explain that in July this year, the import duty on expensive metals increased from 10 percent to 12 in the general budget
 5 fisadi kar diya gaya he
 Mehta continued, "there are three types of demand in gold, first, the demand for the wedding season
 duusari, tyohaari maang or teesri niyamit maang
 In the absence of liquidity in the market, the condition of regular demand is already bad, while the price is high, people are also afraid of investment
 iske alaava tyohaari maang bhi kamjor rahane vaali he
 "however, Ajay Kedia, director of Kedia Advisory, hopes that festival demand will improve
 lekin pichley varsho kii tarah is saal sone-chaandi kii tyohaari maang nahin rahegi, kyonki bhav abhi bhi kaaphi ooncha he
 What is the price of gold? Let me tell you that in Mumbai on Friday, the price of 22 carat gold was Rs 39,190 and 24 carat was Rs 39,340 per 10 grams
 beete dinon sone kaa bhav bhartiya sarrapha bazaar main 40,000 rupee prati 10 gram se upar chalaa gaya tha
 At the same time, in the international market, the price of gold is running above $ 1,500 an ounce on Monday, while the price of gold on October 5 last year was 1,242

 Health kitkat is said that every person should walk at least 1000 steps daily to stay healthy, but the problem is who will count 1000 steps? Keeping your health in mind, kitkat itself will now count how many steps you have taken today

 Who rang the phone bell? Regardless of the number of numbers saved in your phone list, you will still get calls from many numbers that are not saved in the contact list

 Now there is absolutely no need to bother with such people, because kitkat will tell you in advance who has played the bell on your phone

 President Ram Nath Kovind approved the amendment to the POCSO Act and the Fugitive Economic Offenders Ordinance 2018
 shanivaar ko hi pradhanmantri awaas par kendriya cabinet kii baithak main ye donon adhyadesh laae gaye the
 It was sent to the President for approval
 raashtrapati ne bhi bina der kiye in par muhar laga di
 The President approved both the ordinances, now this law has been made as soon as the President approves both the ordinances
 ab 12 saal tak ke masuumon se rape ke doshiyon ko maut kii sajaa milegi
 The cabinet had proposed an amendment to the 'protection of Children from Sexual Offenses'

 Till now, this law did not provide death penalty for the culprits
 kathua main aath saal kii maasoom bacchee ke saath balaatkaar or uske baad hatya kii ghatana ke baad se aise aparaadh ke liye faansee kii sajaa kii maang uth rahi thi
 Rahul Gandhi also attracted the attention of the Prime Minister by tweeting the increasing incidents of rape of minors
 karj lekar videsh bhaagane waalon par nakeliske alaava cabinet kii baithak main jo doosraa adhyadesh laayaa gaya tha, wo bainkon se karj lekar videsh bhaagane waalon par nakel kasne ke liye tha

 Under this, there is a provision to confiscate the properties of people like Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya who have fled the country to avoid criminal action

 Refusal to return to the country will be an absconder, action will be taken against such accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)
 iske tahat abhiyojan se bachane ke liye videsh bhaag jane vaale yaa maamle kaa saamana karne ke liye waapas lautne se inkaar karne vaale ko bhagoda apradhi mana jayega
 Several economic offenses will come under this ambit

 Indications that there will be special emphasis on mutual relations and diplomacy from the countries of the world were found only during Modi's swearing in when all the leaders of SAARC countries were invited and sent

 a Arvind Kejriwal is going to form the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi again
 clin sweep karte hue
 Pausing the Modi wave that has followed the Lok Sabha elections
 bhagoda or dharnebaaj ke thappe se khud ko aaazaad karte hue
 So how did they do the job? kejariwal ne chunaavon kii ghoshnaa ke pehle se hi bijepi par dabaav bana diya tha
 The posters of Jagdish Mukhi, who hung their faces on Delhi's auto rickshaw, created an atmosphere
 2
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not remove the hand of the BJP
 uskaa focus uske mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaaron par hi rahaa
 When it came to projecting Satish Upadhyay, his scams were brought to the fore
 3
 AAP has never loosened its grip on some sections of Delhi
 jaise jhuggi vaale, rehadi vaale or chote kaarobaari
 Their number is about 15 to 20 lakhs
 4
 In Delhi, the anti-corruption campaign has been only about the extortion of police and some other departments
 jisamen ve vaada karte aae hai ki yadi unki sarkaar ai to ve garibon or chote kaarobaariyon ko isse chhutkaaraa dilaayenge
 These voters also trust your promise
 5
 Kejriwal was also successful in describing himself as honest and victim
 pichhali baar istipha dene par ve maafee maangate rahe
 Then when Modi attacked him through accusations, he started describing himself as a victim
 isse unhen sahanubhuti mili
 6
 aam aadmi party ko pataa tha ki unka muqabla us party se he, jiske paas media or campan management ke liye badi team he
 In such a situation, AAP also connected the team of supporters of IIT Bombay to the Delhi elections
 jisane november main soshal media par research kaa aisa tul banaaya, jisase pataa chal sake ki log kin muddon par zyada baat kar rahe hai
 This helped AAP to give direction to its election campaign
 7
 After the Lok Sabha elections, when the BJP was contesting elections all over the country, the AAP team kept the entire focus on Delhi itself
 ghar-ghar logon se sampark banaae rakhaa or apana aadhaar majboot kiya
 While both Congress and BJP remained indifferent
 8
 At the last minute, when Kiran Bedi was brought to light, it triggered infighting in the BJP
 kuch netaaon kii bayaanbaji ne bijepi kaa nuksaan to kiya hi, apratyaksh rup se aap ko phayda pahunchaaya
 9
 pichley chunaav main muslim vot congress or aap ke bich bant gaya tha
 Whereas this time he went completely in favor of you
 kyonki yah maan liya gaya tha ki bijepi ko rokane kaa dam ab congress main nahin bachaa
 10
 voting ke thik pehle aap ke paksh main lagbhag hawa chalane lagi, maano ki ab dilli ek baar puri tarah aap ko satta main dekhnaa chaahati he
