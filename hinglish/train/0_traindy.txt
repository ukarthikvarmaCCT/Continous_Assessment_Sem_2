40 AM on 28 November in front of the workers at Shivaji Park
 yah mahaj vakt he yaa iske peeche koi jyotishiya gananaa he yaa totaka he, ab tak koi jaankaree saamne nahin ai he
 But it is certain that Uddhav Thackeray is ready to become King with the role of Kingmaker

 Penalties kul milakar ab aisi koi niti nahin bachi, jo america ne north korea ke supreme leader marshall kim jong un ko jhukaane ke liye na apanaai ho
 But now when the whole strategy has failed, then US President Donald Trump has removed his special brahmastra
 or ye brahmastra he foot daalo or raaj karo
 Yes, when all the policy fails, Trump has started instigating the people of North Korea against his supreme leader
 mana ja rahaa he ki trump kii ye chaal marshall kim jong un ko baichaiyn karne main kaamyaab sabit hogi
 Piercing the house in Lanka, Marshal Kim Jong of North Korea did not fear America

 Not with his weapons

 There is an old saying in Korea
 It’s dark directly under the lantern jise hindustan main kehete hai chiraag tale andhera
 Overall, the world was scared of bomb ammo to control it

 Trump wants a solution without war
 During a press conference in South Korea on his Asian tour, Donald Trump has said that he wants to resolve the North Korea issue without war
 apane bayaan main na sirf wo uttar korian janata ko behatar bhavishya kaa sapana dikhaa rahe hai balki unhen bhadakaane kii koshish bhi karte nazar aa rahe hai
 Donald Trump's moveamerican President Donald Trump said that North Korea was no longer what Kim Jong Un's grandfather Kim Sang had dreamed of
 kim jong un ne is zamin or yahaan ke logon ke saath jo zyaadati kii, uske baad ab ye ek aisa nark ban chukaa he jo kisi bhi insaan ke rahane laayak nahin bachaa he
 We are confident of getting a better future for you
 lekin ye tabhi mumkin ho saktaa he jab aapaki sarkaar hathiyaar kii hode ko chode
 The strategy of the US to strengthen the rebels is the situation that was in front of America at the time of Saddam or Gaddafi
 wo kim ke saath nahin hai
 Iraq and Libya were attacked by the US only in the sphere of chemical weapons
 jabaki vahaan aise hathiyaar baraamad nahin hue the
 But the US knows that Kim Jong-un has nuclear weapons, so he will not take the risk of war with it
 isliye ab america ne uttar korian sarkaar ke vidrohiyon ko majbooti dena shuru kar di he taaki wo janata ko apane saath shaamil kar kim jong un kaa takhta palat kar saken

 Who is the International Business Broker in the case of Kashmir? Nothing has come from the government on this nor has the International Business Broker said anything on its behalf
 kashmir jaise samvedansheel maamle main khud ko international bijness brokar bataane vaali maadi sharma yani madhu sharma kii madad bharat sarkaar ko kyon leni padi? yah enjio kya aisa kaam karata he jo videshi saansadon kaa kashmir daura karaata he or pradhanmantri modi se mulaakaat kii manzuri bhi le letaa he? aakhir yah brokar koun he jinaki bharat sarkaar main itani pahunch he, lekin inhen lekar koi kuch bol nahin rahaa he
 After all, why did the government seek Madi Sharma's help? Could the help of the Foreign Ministry not be taken to summon these mps? Madi Sharma, a British citizen of Indian origin is a member of the board of 'indo British Trade Council'
 nartingham creatin quarter kii sadsy hai
 He is the President of Human Rights and Democracy under the European Economic and Social Committee
 maadi sharma ne 25 aktubar ko aakhri baar twit kiya he
 European Union mps have not tweeted about the visit
 maadi sharma kaa naam isliye aayaa he kyonki inaki taraf se hi britain ke saansad kris devies ko email bheja gaya tha
 Madi wrote in her email that she is organizing a tour of Kashmir of the European Union mps
 saansadon kii mulaakaat pradhanmantri modi se bhi hogi
 The date of which has been stated as 28 October
 phir 29 taarikh ko kashmir kaa daura hoga or 30 ko press conference
 Everything happens according to this email from Madi Sharma but nothing is known of Madi Sharma who organized the tour
 kya ve bhi is daure main shaamil thim yaa dilli main rah gayi yaa dilli ai hi nahin
 Was help from Madi Sharma's organization to lobby, why did these European Union mps come to call the lobbying organization? Srinavasan Jain and his team Shruti Menon and Arvind Gunasekhar have further investigated the matter
 shuru main yah bhram ho gaya ki maadi sharma ek enjio chalaati hai, kyonki iskaa naam womens Economic And Social Think Tank he
 There was confusion about the name NGO, but its reality comes to light when you Lobbyfact
 Eu tip karenge
 Lobby Fact is a website that collects the accounts of the organizations that lobby in countries associated with the European Union
 taaki research or patrakaron ko lobby ke bare main jaankaree mil sake jo aam taur par gupt rah jaati he
 This institution also finds out how much money the lobbying organization has spent in a year and lobbies with which organizations
 lobby karne vaali sanstha ke paas european sangh kii sansad kii lobby ke kitne paas hai
 Madi Sharma's NGO is also registered on this website
 19 sitambar 2013 ko maadi sharma kii sanstha west is website se judati he
 If Madi Sharma's organization West is an NGO, why is its registration on the website of the lobbying organizations? Whether Madi Sharma has lobbied on the Kashmir issue, if she has taken money also, it is a question all of which are not answered
 yahi nahin maadi sharma ko lekar ek vivaad bhi hua tha
 He had organized a tour in the Maldives
 european sangh ke teen saansad gaye the
 Maldives Ambassador to the European Union wrote to the President of the European Union that Madi Sharma had violated the Maldives laws
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ke twitor handle ko check kiya
 He has tweeted a picture of European mps and the Prime Minister and termed the talks as positive
 lekin srinagar jane or vahaan se laut aane ko lekar koi twit nahin he or na hi in sawaalon ko lekar ki maadi sharma koun he? kyon ek lobby kii madad se in yatraaon kaa aayojan hua or iskaa kharch koi ajibo garib sanstha kyon uthaa rahi he? agar pradhanmantri se hi milanaa tha sabhi ko to iske peeche sandigdh kism ke log or sansthaaen kyon kaam kar rahi thim? usamen in dauron se sambandhit koi twit nahin tha
 Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has tweeted about Madi Sharma
 priyanka ne likhaa, 'bharat ke kisaanon-berojgaar yuvaaon ke liye ye suvidha nahin he ki piem se mulaakaat ho sake, samasyaayein suni ja sake, lekin haa maadi sharma jaise international bijness brokar badi shaan se likh sakate hai ki bharat aaiye ham aapkaa kharchaa bhi uthaaenge'
 Which organization has given the money for the tour which is being described as private, why was it kept secret? When it came to know about the institution, no one came forward to tell the organization
 maadi sharma ne apane email main likhaa he ki european sangh ke saansadon ke daure kaa kharch dilli sthit ek sanstha uthaaegi, jiskaa naam he international institute for nol alide studies
 Our colleague Arvind Gunasekhar visited this office in Safdarganj, Delhi
 international istitute for non alide studies kaa pataa he
 Srivastava Group's office is also in this building
 isi imaarat main ek news website newdilli times kaa daftar bhi he
 On October 29, it was said that if Bhai Dooj is on leave, come on October 30
 arvind jab 30 aktubar ko is daftar main gaye to taala laga tha
 It was said that this office will open after a week
 iske sansthaapak govind narayan shrivastav hai jo ab nahin hai
 In the 1980s, this institution was formed, whose job is to organize a type of gathering-seminar on non-aligned issues
 website par is baat kii jaankaree nahin he ki non alide studies ko koun chalaa rahaa he? magar shrivastav group kii site se pataa chalata he ki unke bete ankit shrivastav vaais chairman hai
 Ankit Srivastava is also the editor of New Delhi Times
 is news website ko maadi sharma apane twitor par follow karti hai
 Madi Sharma also follows Ankit Sharma
 is website par european sangh ke saansadon ke daure kii koi khabar nahin he
 There is no news of this visit on the news website of the organization which is spending the arrival of mps
 is website kii mukhya khabar 30 aktubar kii taarikh se aplod hui he
 This means that the news website did not have a holiday today
 kya sara maamla sandigdh nahin he
 It will be clear only when Ankit Srivastava will answer all the questions
 bataaenge ki company ke kis khate se inhone 27 saansadon ke aane jane kaa tikat kataaya or kharchaa uthaaya
 Can such suspicious organizations and people have access to the Prime Minister, or will the Indian government organize visits to European institutions with the help of such people? When Arvind Gunasekhar spoke to someone in the Srivastava group, he said he could not comment
 unhen kisi delygation ke bare main pataa nahin he
 Who is Madi Sharma? What is the International Institute for Knoll Allied Studies, its head Ankit Srivastava spends 27 mps visiting India, are not all these questions important, why is there silence on these questions? European mps, who arrived in Srinagar, were merged with a section of the press today
 is press conference main kashmir ke sthaneey patrkaar nahin the
 ndtv's Nazir Masudi was not allowed in this press conference
 jo jaankaree aa rahi he uske mutabik news agency eenai or kuch channelon ko hi 23 saansadon se milane kaa mauka diya gaya
 European Union mps said that their visit was viewed from a wrong perspective, they have come here to find out the facts
 ek saansad nicholas fist ne kaha ki agar aap european sangh ke saansadon ko kashmir aane de rahe hai to bharat ke vipakshi netaaon ko bhi aane dena chahie
 There has been a kind of imbalance
 sarkaar ko thik karnaa chahie

 yah bhi kaha ki kya ho rahaa he iske liye or soochna kii zarurat he
 We are living in a time where there is a lot of news fake
 kuch saansadon ne aatanki ghatnaon ko lekar chintaa jataai
 Said that terrorists coming from Pakistan are cause for concern
 ek saansad ne kaha ki bahut kuch galat dharna failaai ja rahi he, wo jaakar apni sansad ko sahi baat bataaenge
 There is a debate as to why the opposition is opposing the visit? Till yesterday, there was protest why the opposition is talking about Kashmir, which is being discussed abroad
 is baat par sawaal uthaane se bachaa rahaa he ki kashmir jaise samvedansheel maamle main lobing form kii madad kyon lee gai? kisi anaam sanstha ne kaise 27 saansadon ke teen din ke daure kaa kharchaa diya he
 Who did the European Union mps meet in Srinagar, could they meet the common people even under heavy security? ye khabar non resident indian ke liye he
 In whatever country of the world they live, especially in America, Australia and Britain, have they heard the whole police station being filed
 bahut zaruri he ki ham is baat ko praathamikta den ki zamin par police or kachhari kaa system kaise kaam karata he? sari badi baaten dhari rah jaati hai jab thanon or kachhari kaa chakkar padataa he
 Millions of common people are troubled by fake cases

 Fast bowler r Vinay Kumar said that the icc's rules of using two new balls in an innings of an ODI match is very beneficial for fast bowlers, as it helps in making the ball swing more
 bharat or england ke bich vartmaan shrunkhlaa main yah niyam lagu kiya gaya he
 Vinaykumar said on the eve of the third ODI, "I feel good"
 main (dilli main) apane pradarshan se kaaphi khush hum
 Initially the white ball does not swing much, but using two balls is very helpful for bowlers
 firozshah kotla main 30 ran dekar chaar wicket lene vaale vinayakumar ne kaha, pehle gend zyada se zyada paanch yaa chah over swing karti thi, lekin ab vah 10-12 over tak swing karti he
 This (rule of two new balls) is good for bowlers
 dilli main bharat kii jeet main ahm bhoomika nibhaane ke baavjood vinay kumaar ko main of da match nahin chunaa gaya or unki jagah viraat kohli is puraskaar ke liye chune gaye, jinhone 98 gend par naabad 112 ran banaae
 Vinay Kumar said about this, Virat showed a really good game
 yah behtareen pari thi
 The biggest reward for me is the team's win
 unhone ummid jataai ki mohali kii pich se bhi tej gendbaajon ko madad milegi
 The Karnataka bowler said, history shows that Mohali's wicket is favorable for fast bowlers
 ummid he ki hamen yahaan acchhee swing milegi

 smartphone companiyaan camera ko lekar lagaataar nae prayog kar rahi hai
 Oppo and Vivo have launched smartphones with pop up selfie cameras in the market
 samsung ne pehali baar rotating camera ke saath Galaxy A80 launch kiya he
 OPO launched a smartphone with slider camera some time ago
 tradishnal selfi camera dhire dhire ek alag shape le rahaa he
 To avoid bezels in the display, companies are resorting to the Notch and Panchalol displays
 selfi camaron ke saath ye experiment karne kaa makasad ye bhi he ki phone kii disple main bejal kam die jaaen or selfi kii quality behatar kii ja sake
 Since selfie-based smartphones are more preferred in India, companies do not want to be left behind
 kya he pop ap camerapop camera selfi camera smartphone ke top main hota he
 This front camera comes out when you have to take a selfie
 iske liye koi batan nahin hota
 It comes out on its own when you choose the selfie option in the camera app
 haalanki pop ap camera baahar aane main zyada samay nahin lagaataa he, lekin phir bhi dradishnal front camere ke mukaable ye slo hota he
 The advantage of such a pop up camera is that if someone will not be able to spy on you through the front camera of your smartphone
 aam taur par laptop or mobile ke front camere se jasusi kii jaati he
 What is the slider camera Oppo Find x has a slider camera, which is the company's premium smartphone
 iske alaava Mi Mix or huaave ke smartphone main bhi aise camere die gaye hai
 This camera is also in the top of the smartphone and it is also given for the purpose of more display and at least bezel
 pop ap camere se ye alag isliye he, kyonki isamen front or rier donon hi camere hote hai
 It is also automatic and software based
 yani iske liye koi batan nahin he or camera opshan se hi ye on hota he
 Rotating Camera: Samsung Galaxy A80 has a rotating camera
 isaki khaasiyat ye he ki ye tripal camera kaa modul he
 Like the slider camera, it is also automatic out and it is also in the top
 lekin pop ap or slider se kaam karne main kaaphi alag he
 This is because the given camera rotates
 yani yahi teen camere front or rier donon tarah se hi kaam karte hai
 For selfie, this camera will rotate to the front, while the rear will go back
 ye kaaphi fast he or shaayad aapako zyada lag feel na ho
 Still nothing can be said without review
 slider, pop ap or rotating camere ke kuch limitations bhi hai
 First thing is Face Unlock
 hamane ab tak jitne slider or pop ap camere vaale smartphone rivyuu kiye hai sabhi tradishnal phase analock vaale smartfones ke mukaable slo hote hai
 How Samsung's response to this smartphone will be seen
 duusari limitesan respons rate kii he, kyonki duusare tradishnal selfi camere kii tarah ye thodaa zyada time lagaate hai, kyonki inhen yaa to pop ap hona hota he

 adhikari ne bataaya ki agar seva niyamon kaa anusaran nahin kiya gaya he to centre sarkaar sambandhit adhikariyon ke vetan ko rokane ko majaboor hogi
 "all the appointments in Delhi government should be as per the rules, the salary of Delhi employees comes through the Union Home Ministry," the official said

" sarkaar kii taraf se main aapako kahata hum ki maujuuda aarakshan niti main ek coma yaa phul stop kaa bhi badlaav nahin hoga
 Paswan pointed to Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar, saying, "these people are creating irrelevant things in an unnecessary way
" ham nijee kshetra main bhi aarakshan lagu karenge
 The LJP, which is contesting the Bihar Assembly elections as an ally of the NDA, has not only talked about raising the 50 per cent reservation limit, but has also promised to implement reservation in the private sector when the party comes to power

 Its first anniversary on July 8 continues to cause trouble for the government
 pehali barsi manaane kaa elaan algaavvaadiyon ne pehle hi kar diya he
 For this, a striking calendar has also been released
 prashasan or surakshabalon ko is dauraan maahaul bigadane kii puri ashanka he
 The reason is that Amarnath Yatra is taking place among all of them
 sarkaar main is baat ko lekar asamanjas main he ki aise halaat main kya vah hadataali calendar ke dinon ke liye amarnath yatra ko sthagit kar de yaa phir ise jari rakhane kaa khatra mol le
 As such, the separatist group has already prepared protests during the striking calendar from 8 July to 13 July
 isse nipatane ke liye police va naagarik prashasan ke saath-saath centre sarkaar bhi qamar kas chuki he
 Government holiday has been announced in schools, colleges and universities

 The comments vaise 28 june se jari hui amarnath yatra bina kisi dikkat ke jari he lekin ashanka barkaraar he ki kahin 8 se 13 july ke bich aatanki hamalaa na ho jaae
 The reason is that the center of whatever protest has been announced about Burhan's death anniversary is Anantnag district
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah bhi he ki jammu se shuru hone vaali amarnath yatra bhi anantnag jile se hote hue isi jile main khatm ho jaati he

 The security forces, however, have made full preparations to deal with any untoward situation on their part
 lekin kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki amarnath yatra ko kuch dinon ke liye roka diya jaae to bura nahin hoga
 This will avert the danger to a great extent

 prashasan or surakshabalon ko is dauraan maahaul bigadane kii puri ashanka he
 The reason is that Amarnath Yatra is taking place among all of them
 sarkaar main is baat ko lekar asamanjas main he ki aise halaat main kya vah hadataali calendar ke dinon ke liye amarnath yatra ko sthagit kar de yaa phir ise jari rakhane kaa khatra mol le
 As such, the separatist group has already prepared protests during the striking calendar from 8 July to 13 July
 isse nipatane ke liye police va naagarik prashasan ke saath-saath centre sarkaar bhi qamar kas chuki he
 Government holiday has been announced in schools, colleges and universities
 sabhi intervyuu or parikshaayen sthagit kii ja chuki hai
 The comments vaise 28 june se jari hui amarnath yatra bina kisi dikkat ke jari he lekin ashanka barkaraar he ki kahin 8 se 13 july ke bich aatanki hamalaa na ho jaae
 The reason is that the center of whatever protest has been announced about Burhan's death anniversary is Anantnag district
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah bhi he ki jammu se shuru hone vaali amarnath yatra bhi anantnag jile se hote hue isi jile main khatm ho jaati he
 Let me tell you that when the security forces killed Burhan Wani on 8 July 2016, a period of stone-pelting started in Kashmir which continued for several months
 patharbaajon ke tevar thande nahi pade hai
 When it goes bad, it cannot be said
 yahi vajah he ki prashasan ne ab yah jimmedaari rajya sarkaar par daal di he ki vah is par antim faisla le
 The security forces, however, have made full preparations to deal with any untoward situation on their part
 lekin kaha yah bhi ja rahaa he ki amarnath yatra ko kuch dinon ke liye roka diya jaae to bura nahin hoga
 This will avert the danger to a great extent
 vaise bhi algaavvaadi gut pehle hi 8 july se 13 july tak hadataali calendar ke dauraan virodh pradarshnon kii taiyaari kar chukaa he
 Along with police and civil administration, the central government has also been gearing up to deal with it
 skulon, kalejon or vishvavidhyalayon main sarkari chuttee kaa elaan ho chukaa he
 All interviews and examinations have been postponed
 tippaniyan Although the Amarnath Yatra, which started from June 28, continues without any problem, but there is a possibility that there will be a terrorist attack between July 8 and 13
 vajah he ki burhan kii barsi ko lekar jo bhi virodh pradarshan kaa elaan hua he uskaa centre anantnag jila he
 It is also worth noting that the Amarnath Yatra starting from Jammu also ends in Anantnag district in this district
 aapako bataa den ki jab 8 july 2016 ko surakshabalon ne burhan vaani ko maar giraaya tha tab kashmir main patharbaji kaa daur shuru hua tha jo kai maheenon tak jari rahaa tha
 Stones have not cooled yah kab bighad jaaen kaha nahin ja saktaa
 This is the reason that the administration has now placed this responsibility on the state government to take a final decision on it
 surakshabalon ne haalanki apni ore se kisi bhi apriy halaat se nipatane ke liye puri taiyaari kar lee he
 But it is also being said that if Amarnath Yatra is stopped for a few days, it will not be bad
 isse khatra kaaphi had tak tal jayega

 lekhak ne kaha ki vivaahit yugalon ko sthaayee vaivaahik sambandh kaa rahasy jaanane ke liye france kii ore dekhnaa chahie

 a twitter attack has erupted between Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh and senior BJP leader Sushma Swaraj
 pehle digvijay ne twit kar narendra modi kii bijepi main piem ummidavaari par sawaal uthaae
 He tweeted and exhorted the BJP that Sushma Swaraj could be a better PM candidate than Modi
 bijepi unke naam kaa elaan kyon nahin karti? iske jawaab main sushamaa ne twit kar kaha ki digvijay bhi rahul gandhi se behatar piem ummidavaar ho sakate hai
 Digvijay tweeted again after Sushma's tweet
 unhone kaha, 'tarif karne ke liye sushamaa ji kaa shukriya
 Teach Modi the history lesson
 ' unhone ye bhi kaha ki modi ke paas idiaj kaa abhaav he
 He has stolen the Congress' slogan of poverty
 modi ko pehle ye bataanaa chahie ki gujarat main garibi rekha se neeche rahane vaale pariwaron kii sankhya kyon badi he
 Digvijay has also taken earlier that Sushma's name is not the first time that Digvijay has taken Sushma's name as a PM candidate
 isse pehle bhi vah kah chuke hai ki piem pad ke liye bijepi main sushamaa sabase badi daavedaar hai
 In retaliation, Sushma has said that creating controversy is an old habit of Digvijay
 sardaar patel kii antyeshti main pandit nehru kii maujuudagi kaa vivadadigvijay ne kaha, 'sardaar patel kii antyeshti main pandit nehru ke nahin jane vaale bayaan ke liye modi ko saarvajanik taur par maafee maangana chahie
 Morarji Desai's autobiography records that Nehru and the then President Rajendra Prasad were present at the funeral of Sardar Patel in Bombay
 'digvijay modi kii udaipur raily main kii gayi us tippanee kaa zikr kar rahe the jisamen unhone kaha tha ki nehru desh ke pehle grih mantri sardaar vallabhbhai patel kii atyeshti main shaamil nahin hue the
 Digvijay's statement in this regard has come that Modi's history lesson should be taught
 grahamantri ke ghar ke baahar bheed kaa gussa, police headquarter ke saamne public kaa pradarshan, ames ke baahar bhadkaa naujavaanon kaa aakrosh
 This revolution is all that is needed, that question should be removed from every daughter of the country, there is no fear of facing a heinous accident like rape
 ye kaise hoga, ye mauka aa gaya he tay karne kaa
 Otherwise, when the doll comes out of the hospital, how will she feel
 jab darindon ke saae use har taraf dikhenge, wo maasoom jinda rahakar bhi kaise ji paaegi
 As soon as this question comes to mind, it starts to suffer
 ye log usee din se dar rahe hai, isliye apni parvaah kiye bagaiyr ek benaam ke liye aawaaj buland kar rahe hai
 This is the same outrage, the same question, which has been burning in the hearts of everyone since the December 16 gang-rape
 aakhir koi himmat kaise kar letaa he ladki ko uthaa lene kii, uski aabru, uski jindagi, uske sapane kuchal dene kii
 How can anyone dare? kya wo insaan nahin? kya use kanoon kaa katai dar nahin? agar aisa he, to phir kaise nikalegaa hamaari betiyon ke man se un haivaanon kaa khauf? kaise le sakengi, wo khuli hawa main saans? kaise kar sakengi apane hisse kii aazaadee kaa ahsaas? kya betiyon ko iskaa haq nahin? betiyon ko kyon kerani pad rahi he mashkkat apane haq ke liye?wo apane mahfuj hone kaa bharosa hi to maang rahi hai
 a suitable answer is needed to stop this outrage
 inaki takhtiyon par likhi ibaaratein yahi puch rahi hai
 This is not a political statement, but the voice of the people
 ise ansuna kiya jaataa rahaa to ise baghawat main badalte der nahin lagegi
 Look in your eyes, why this anger is increasing every time
 paanch saal kii wo gudiya jis tarah aspataal main har pal maut se jujh rahi he, uske jaddojahad ke saath paravaan chadh rahaa he ye aakrosh
 This anger of the public kept shaking the eyes with the rising sun
 andar ubal rahe gusse kii aanch itani, ki kisi ne tapati dhoop main bhi apni parvaah nahin kii
 i wish the rulers of the country would have guessed, this anger has reached this stage by passing through the staggering streets of pain
 agar andaja hota, is tarah bagawati nahin hote jajbaat
 All such youngsters are raising their voices and making them realize the responsibilities which the promise of the country has refused to fulfill
 varanaa apane desh main apni sarkaar, apni police ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaane kaa kya matlab?logon ke gusse kaa ye alam dekhie dilli police ke headquarter ke baahar, jo police vaale tainaat kiye jate hai logon kii suraksha ke liye, virodh ke sakht tewaron ke aage bericade ke andar khud ke surakshit hone kaa sukun mahasoos kar rahe hai
 The Delhi Police has seen this anger of the people before
 lekin is baar iske tevare uske hosh uda dene vaale hai
 This crowd is intent on wearing bangles
 jis tarah police paise dekar gudiya ke pita kaa munh band karana chaah rahi thi, vaise hajaaron rupee police ke munh par maar rahi hai mahilaayein
 As you are saying, take this money, if you get a doll like this before, then stand in front of us
 mitaa do uske sharir se jakhm ke wo nishaan, dur kar do uske maasoom dil main baitha darinda ko khauf
 Give me confidence, that the doll will no longer be in such a situation with any girl like you
 magar kya aisa ho saktaa he, gusse main ubalati ye bheed yahi puch rahi he
 The trust to be safe in a democracy should be met without asking, what is the need to demand punishment for the innocents like dolls
 apane desh, apane ghar main surakshit rahane kaa bharosa haal main nibhaayaa janaa chahie
 If that trust is broken, who is responsible for it? We are fed up with a shameful accident like rape
 haivaaniyat ke us dard se lagaataar guzarate hue
 Why are we forced to go through this phase of Jalalat? This request is from every guard of democracy

 a major case of theft has come to light in the capital Delhi
 jahaan jet airways ke vaais president (suraksha) avaneet singh kii beti ke ghar se shaatir choron ne karodon ke heere jawaharaat or nakadi par haath saaf kar diya
 This incident is from a posh area of delhi
 police ne maamla darj kar karrwai shuru kar di he
 This sensational theft incident is from the Defense Colony of Delhi's posh area
 jahaan anand lok main jet airways ke vaais president (suraksha) avaneet singh kii beti apane pati tanmay seth ke saath rahati hai
 When those people went out of the house last night, they cleaned their house with diamond jewels worth Rs 3 crore and cash of Rs 60 thousand
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki yah dilli main kisi ghar main kii gai ab tak kii sabase badi chori he
 Tamanya Seth, son-in-law of Avneet Singh, lives on the third floor with family in Anand Lok
 tamanya seth kii tamilnadu main agriculture product banane kii factory he
 He had gone with the family to a wedding ceremony in Delhi on Sunday evening
 der raat jab vah ghar laute to unke ghar kaa mukhya taala tutaa hua tha or bedroom kaa puraa saamaan failaa hua tha
 He immediately informed the police

 After police investigation, it was found that the thieves had entered his house through the window

 But Seth has no doubt about his servants
 hairaani kii baat ye bhi he ki unke ghar main koi sisitivi camera tak nahin he
 On the other hand, the police have started trying to solve the case by collecting finger prints and forming several teams
 lekin jis tarah se mahaz chand ghanton ke dauraan is vaardaat ko anjaam diya gaya he, usase police ko isamen kisi bhediye ke shaamil hone kaa shaq he
 This is the reason why the police have taken everyone on their radar
 ek khaas baat yah bhi he ki choron ne sirf ek bedroom ko hi torget kiya he, jisamen seth danpati kii shaadi kii jewelri or saath hazaar rupye cash rakhe hue the, jabaki wo duusare kamaron main nahin gaye
 Perhaps one reason for this is the presence of a dog in their house

 desh ko sabase adhik rail mantri dene vaale bihar ko narendra modi sarkaar ke pehle rail bajet se kaaphi ummid he
 There are many such railway projects in Bihar in which work started but it is incomplete even after years while the demand for many trains has not been met yet
 bihar ke logon kaa aarope he ki pichley do-teen varshon ke rail bajet main lagaataar bihar kii upeksha ho rahi he
 Whatever Bihar is getting is nothing more than a lollipop
 log maanate hai ki bihar aaj rail ke kshetra main kaaphi peeche he
 Former Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav, LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan were the railway ministers of the country, many railway projects came in Bihar and many important trains were also received but since then Bihar has never got the nod of the Railway Ministry
 Pie
 bihar main kai aise kshetra bhi hai jo aaj tak rail pahunchane kii pratiksha kar rahe hai
 People believe that Bihar has given many railway ministers and in this government too, there are many ministers including Ram Vilas Paswan of Bihar, so Bihar has many expectations from this railway budget
 bihar main purv rail mantri lalu ke dream project main madhepura vidyut ingine kaarkaana tha
 Even after ten years, no major progress has been made for the project so far
 jab is kaarkaane kii aadharshila rakhi gai thi tab iske nirmaan kii laagat 1000 karod rupee bataai gai tha
 When Lalu Prasad was the railway minister of the country, the Chapra Rail Wheel Plant was approved in 2006, but till now the railway wheel has not been removed from this factory
 31 july 2010 kii samay avadhi tak banakar taiyaar ho jane vaale is kaarkaane main prativarsh ek lakh pahiyaa banane kaa lakshya tha
 Similarly, Harnaut railway factory has not been able to land on the land till date, so the digha-sonpur road cum rail bridge has not been completed yet
 isi tarah munger main ganga nadi par nirmaanadhin rail sah sadak pul kaa nirmaan kaary bhi 70 pratishat se zyada puraa ho chukaa he parantu yah bich main hi ruk gaya he
 Economist NK Chaudhary, a professor at Patna University, says that while the Railway Minister has done many things from Bihar, even today, in terms of rail, Bihar is very backward
 ve kehete hai ki bihar kaa ek bada kshetra nepal ke saath judaa hua he jiske liye relon kii sankhya in kshetron main badhanaa kaaphi aavashyak he
 He says that Modi's 'good days' must be there for Bihar
 bihar chembar of commers kaa bhi maananaa he ki patna se nai dilli or mumbai ke bich or express trainon kii jarurat he
 People of Bihar say that the number of tourists in the state today is more than the tourist places like Goa, in such a situation, the lack of traffic facilities will be ignored
 sthaneey log kehete hai ki bihar or jharkhand kii rajdhani ranchi ko jodne ke liye bhaayaa dalatonganj hokar bhi express train kii jarurat he
 However, there are many hopes from the Railway Budget presented to the people of Bihar, in such a situation, Biharis say that now the 'good days' should come for Bihar in the rail sector

 The indefinite hunger strike of Hardik Patel lasted for 19 days

 of DMK
 raja or tiemasi ke dinesh trivedi tak, sabhi ahmedabad ke baahar sthit us farmahouse par pahunche jahaan hardik kaa virodh pradarshan chal rahaa tha
 Needless to say, this increased the political standing of this young Patidar leader
 vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki maahaul lagbhag vaisaa hi lag rahaa he jaisaa april 2015 main dikhaa tha jab hardik pehali baar apane samudaay ke logon ke liye aarakshan kii maang ko lekar hue pradarshan main barbar police lathicharge ko jhelane ke baad ubhare the
 The angry Patel community had staged violent demonstrations in response to the lathicharge that had led them to face strict police action once more
 yahaan se hardik ko ek bada rajnatik maidan miltaa gaya or antatru 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main unhone bhaajapa ko kaaphi nuksaan pahunchaaya
 But this time the Gujarat government has adopted a better strategy to curb Hardik's influence
 bhaajapa ke pradesh adhyaksh jitu waghani ne pehle hi din is patidaar ke upwas ko "congress pryojit khel'' bataakar ise khaarij kar diya tha or 2015 kii hinsa kaa hawala dete hue rajya prashasan ne dhara 144 lagaakar anshan sthal par chaar se adhik logon ke jutaney ko gaiyr-kanoonee qaraar diya
 The state government refused to discuss Hardik's two main demands, such as reservation quota for Patels and farm loan waiver of Rs 82,000 crore
 gussaye hardik samarthakon ne patidaaron ke garh mehsana or amarelli jilon main bade paimaane par virodh pradarshan kiya
 The ruling BJP termed his "fast unto death" as a big drama and laggard event
 yah bataaya ja rahaa he ki daura karne vaale rajanetaaon ke haathon hardik do baar pani pi chuke the
 When he was forcibly taken to a government hospital for a health check-up on 7 September, his supporters said that Hardik's life was in danger in a government hospital, so he should be examined in a private hospital
 gujarat sarkaar kisi bhi prakaar kaa jokhim uthaane ko taiyaar nahin thi
 The government knows that Hardik, along with the Congress, is eager to play a big role in next year's Lok Sabha elections and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani does not want to give him a chance
 mukhyamantri roopaani raahat kii saans le sakate hai ki ki hardik kaa anshan bina koi nayaa bakheda khadaa kiye aakhirkaar khatm ho gaya
 Chief Minister Rupani can now breathe a sigh of relief that Hardik's "fast unto death" ended without a hitch

 The shooting of Bollywood star Salman Khan's next film may continue in London, but Salman himself is still in Hindustan
 jaankaar sutron ke mutabik, salmaan khan kii visa ke liye di gai arji khaarij kar di gai he, or uske liye koi vajah bhi nahin bataai gai he
 It has been reported that Salman Khan was to start shooting his parts of the film in London from last week itself
 tippaniyan People close to Salman feel that the dismissal of the application may have something to do with the pending 'hit and run' case against Salman Khan in court
 ek sutara ne kaha, "salmaan khan court main 24 july ko pesh hue the, lekin aakhri faisla nahin liya gaya
 
 
 In fact, the hearing was adjourned on 19 July, and charges were framed against him (salman Khan) on 24 July
 
 
 court ne tab aarope tay kiye or maamle kii agali sunwaayee 19 agast ko tay kar di
 
 
 Nowadays, as the rules for granting visas for the UK have been tightened, the condition of Salman Khan's visit was affected by the condition of the bet
 
 
 " a source associated with the film's unit said, "however, we can apply for a visa again
 
 
 ham sari prakriya dobaaraa shuru karne se pehle agle hafte tak intazaar karenge
 
 
 Hopefully, he (salman Khan) will get a visa by then, and he will be able to reach the rest of the cast in London
 
 
 vaise hi is maamle kii vajah se shooting shedul se kaaphi peeche chal rahi he
 
 
 "on the other hand, the film's director Sajid Nadiadwala could not be available for comment on the issue
 salmaan ke kareebi logon ko lagata he ki arji khaarij kiye jane kaa salmaan khan ke khilaaf court main pending 'hit and ran' cese se kuch lenaa-dena ho saktaa he
 a source said, "salman Khan appeared in court on July 24, but the final decision was not taken
 
 
 darasal, 19 july ko sunwaayee sthagit kii gai thi, or 24 july ko unke (salmaan khan ke) khilaaf aarope tay kiye gaye the
 
 
 The court then framed the charges and fixed the next hearing of the case on 19 August
 
 
 aajkal chunki euke ke liye visa dene ke niyam kuch sakht kar die gaye hai, isliye shartiya is cese se salmaan khan kii yatra ke kaarykram par asar padaa
 
 
 " film kii unit se jude ek sutara ne kaha, "baharhaal, ham log visa ke liye phir arji de sakate hai
 
 
 We will wait until next week before starting the whole process again
 
 
 ummid he ki tab tak unhen (salmaan khan ko) visa mil jayega, or vah baaki cast ke paas landan pahunch sakenge
 
 
 Similarly, because of this case, the shooting is lagging behind schedule
 
 
 " udhar, film ke nirdeshak sajid nadiadwala is mudde par tippanee ke liye uplabdh nahin ho sake

 Abu Jindal has revealed that he went to Rawalpindi for a few days after the 26 / 11 attack in Mumbai, where he was handed a new passport by the ISI in the name of Riyasat Ali
 ab suniye isse aage kaa khulaasa, jo ab tak kisi ne nahin suna
 According to information received from sources, Jindal has told the police that i moved from Rawalpindi to Karachi with a new passport
 karachi ke queta hotel main meri mulaakaat riyaaz or ikbaal bhatkal se hui
 Adil, who lives in the Dastagir area of karachi, met me in this hotel
 mumbai kaa maamla abhi thanda nahin padaa tha ki ham log ek baar phir hindustan main nae dhamaake karne kii taiyaari main jute gaye the
 Abu Jindal's interrogation also revealed that Adil is the same terrorist of Pakistan, who had fired rapidly after the Jama Masjid in Delhi
 adil, jo karachi ke eggbi aria ke flats number e-9, yusuf plaza, dastagir ilaake kaa rahane vaala he
 He was earlier associated with the Mohajir Qaumi Movement , but went underground after a deadly attack by the opposing faction

 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said in the Lok Sabha that there must be some evil planet going on
 tabhi to mere saathi jo mujhe itnaa sneh dete hai, itnaa aadar karte hai, wo aaj meri tikhi aalochana kar rahe hai
 They are asking for my resignation, but i also believe that the planet will collapse very soon and the harmony of my colleagues will return
 sushamaa ji ne us grah kaa naam bataa diya hota to kai channelon par use shant karaane vaale jyotishiyon ne morcha sambhaal liya hota
 These are the people who have affection for Sushma ji, but these days they are asking for resignation because of the planet
 dekha jaae to ye grah jitna sushamaa virdohi he utana hi sonia virdohi bhi
 Due to this, Sushma ji is getting inadequate, so Soniaji's party is not getting any less notoriety
 pataa lagaaya janaa chahie ye shanicharaa he ki raahu ketu yaa phir rahul sonia
 Parliament is also troubled by this planet
 kya aisa ho saktaa he ki istife kii maang chhod congress sadan main aa jaae or grah par hi charchaa sweekaar kar le
 By the way, the Foreign Minister has said that if there is a discussion, she will answer the rest of the questions in detail, then what was the need of this statement before the discussion
 kya charchaa nahin hone tak is bayaan ko antim mana jaae
 Did the government give the final message through the statement that even after the monsoon ruins the winter season, we have given our clarification
 yah baat sahi he ki sushamaa swaraj monsoon satr ke pehle din se aaropon par charchaa or jawaab dene ke liye taiyaar thim
 On Thursday too, he said that for about 2 months, the media has been misleading against me
 magar main shanti se baithkar sansad ke monsoon satr kii pratiksha karti rahi ki sansad kaa satr shuru hoga, is vishay par charchaa hogi or main har prashn kaa vistaar se uttar duungi
 By the way, Sushma Swaraj was making some statements about this issue before and during the monsoon session through Twitter
 2 agast ko hi twit kiya ki maine british sarkaar se lalit modi ke yatra dastauez ke liye na to guzarish kii or na kabhi prastaav kiya
 While the matter came to the fore, he tweeted 12 times on 13 June and said that maanavtaavaadi khyaal se maine british ucchayukta se kaha ki british sarkaar ko british niyamon ke tahat lalit modi kii prarthana par vichaar karnaa chahie
 If the British Government decides to give a travel document, our relations will not be affected
 khud hi kaha he ki unhone british ucchayukta se baat kii lalit modi kii arzi par vichaar karnaa chahie
 But the External Affairs Minister in the Lok Sabha says that i want to say with full responsibility that this allegation is completely false and is untrue
 maine kabhi bhi british sarkaar se lalit ji ko yatra dastauez dene kaa anurodh nahin kiya
 You know that request and recommendation letters have a language
 main chunauti detii hum ki ek kaagaj ek parchi ek chitthee ek email mere par aarope lagane vaale yahaan par prastut kar den jisamen maine aisa koi bhi vaakya likhaa ho ki lalit modi ko travel dacument de dijie yaa aapako dene chahie
 Lalit Modi from Rajdeep Sardesai of India Today has also admitted that i had called Sushma ji, asked for help, he was kind to me
 lalit modi ne yah bhi kaha ki sushamaa swaraj ne out aaf da ve jaakar meri madad kii
 Sushma ji herself is agreeing that she has asked the British High Commissioner, to whom and why is she asking for proof of the letter or email
 khayr loksabhaa main videsh mantri ne kaha ki maine lalit modi ko koi phayda nahin pahunchaaya
 Was it an advantage that he could sign the consent letter for his wife's surgery
 ve landan main the
 Moved to London after surgery
 badla kya
 If the Congress had participated in the House, many questions would have been clear but Anand Sharma definitely participated in the discussion through a press conference
 lalit modi kii bahut sari tasviren bhi le aae or kaha ki 4 agast 2014 ko agar ye vahaan gaye hai to 6 agast ko paryaton ke liye mashhoor shahar he

 There are so many such cases, how many such petitions came on which they took this decision
 monsoon satr ke pehle din yani 21 july ko sushamaa swaraj ne twit kiya ki ek varisht congress netaa ne mujh par dabaav banaaya tha ki main koyala ghotaale main aaropee santosh bagrodeo ko diplomatic passport dilava duun
 i will tell the name of that leader in the House also
 yah sunate hi santosh bagrodia saamne aae or sweekaar kiya ki haa maine sushamaa ji se aktubar 2014 main apane diplomatic passport ke vistaar ke liye mila tha lekin sushamaa ji ne manzuri nahin di
 i have a passport and no court or CBI has barred me from going abroad
 main may june main apni patni ke ilaaj ke liye america gaya tha
 My wife is also a patient of cancer
 vaajapeyi sarkaar main swasth mantri rahete hue sushamaa ji ne meri patni ke ilaaj ke liye sarkari kharch par america jane kii manzuri di thi 
 Sushma Swaraj also cited the Economic Times news in which the Home Department of England has admitted that there has been no violation of rules in giving travel documents to Lalit Modi
 congress kaa aarope he ki britain kii sarkaar to niyam se hi dastauez banaaegi lekin use banane ke liye videsh niti ke str par sushamaa ne chhot kyon di
 Well, Sushma Swaraj said how did she do it, why tell me what she did before
 anand sharma ne bataate hue kaha ki 3 july 2014 ko jab landan ke adhikari ne likhit main bataa diya ki lalit modi kii arzi riject ho gai he to dobaaraa prayaas hota he
 Lalit Modi spoke to Sushma ji and then told Keith Vaz that the Foreign Minister of India was ready to say that the Government of India had no objection
 kagaz de die jaae
 Keith Vaz informed this by letter to the biggest border authority officials whose job is to give passport, visa, travel document
 unhone us par likhit main diya ki sushamaa ji ko isse koi aapatti nahin he, wo iskaa samarthan karti he, meri unase baat hui he
 The comments anand sharma kaa sawaal he ki sushamaa swaraj ne britain kii sarkaar ke kisi adhikari ke bina puche apni pratikriya kyon di thi
 Telling the British High Commissioner that give travel documents will not affect our relations, there can be a big recommendation
 is puure maamle ki bharat ke videsh mantralay vitt mantralay britain main bharat ke ucchayukta ko jaankaree tak nahin thi
 Sushma Swaraj says that for the treatment of the wife helped on the basis of humanity
 anand sharma kehete hai ki lalit modi ne yatra dastauez ke liye jo arzi lagaai thi usamen teen kaaran likhe ki ek sichelles ke raashtrapati se milane janaa he, bahan kii shaadi he, patni kaa ilaaj bhi he
 Treatment is at number three
 to sushamaa swaraj ke is bayaan se maamla khatm hota he yaa ek baar phir se shuru ho jaataa he
 That is why my colleagues who give me so much affection, respect it so much, are criticizing me bitterly today
 meraa istipha maang rahe hai lekin mujhe ye bhi vishwaas he ki grah bahut jaldi talegaa or mere saathiyon kaa sadbhaav lautega
 If Sushma ji had given the name of that planet, the astrologers who pacified it on many channels would have taken the front
 yahi wo log hai jo sushamaa ji se sneh rakhte hai magar in dinon grah ke kaaran istipha maang rahe hai
 If seen, this planet is as much anti-sushma and equally anti-sonia
 iske kaaran sushamaa ji ko apyash mil rahaa he to sonia ji kii party kii bhi kam badanaami nahin ho rahi he
 It has to be ascertained whether it is Rahu Ketu or Rahul Sonia
 is grah se sansad bhi pareshaan he
 Could it be that the Congress leaves the House demanding resignation and accepts the discussion on the planet itself
 vaise videsh mantri ne kaha he ki agar charchaa ho to ve baaki sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi vistaar se dengi to charchaa se pehle is bayaan kii kya zarurat thi
 Whether this statement should be considered final until discussed
 kya sarkaar ne is bayaan ke zariye antim sandesh de diya ki monsoon kya sheetakaaleen satr bhi barbaad kar dekh lijie hamane apni safai de di he
 It is true that Sushma Swaraj was ready to discuss and answer the allegations from the first day of the monsoon session
 guuruuvaar ko bhi unhone kaha ki lagbhag 2 maah se media ke madhyam se mere kilaaf kuprachaar chal rahaa he
 But i sat calmly waiting for the monsoon session of Parliament that the session of Parliament would begin, the subject would be discussed and i would answer every question in detail
 vaise sushamaa swaraj monsoon satr se pehle or iske dauraan bhi twitor ke zariye is masale main kuch na kuch bayaan to de hi rahi thim
 On August 2, he tweeted that i neither requested nor proposed to the British government for Lalit Modi's travel document
 jabaki is maamle ke saamne aate hi unhone 13 june ko 12 baar twit kar kaha tha ki With a humanitarian view, i told the British High Commissioner that the British government should consider Lalit Modi's prayer under British rules
 agar british sarkaar yatra dastauez dene kaa faisla karti he to hamaare sambandhon par asar nahin padegaa
 He himself has said that he spoke to the British High Commissioner and should consider the application of Lalit Modi
 lekin loksabhaa main videsh mantri kahati hai ki main puri zimmedaari ke saath kahana chaahati hum ki ye aarope saraasal galat he asaty he niraadhaar he
 i never requested the British government to give a travel document to Lalitji
 aapako maaloom he ki anurodh or sifarish patron kii ek bhashaa hoti he
 i challenge you to submit a paper, a slip, a letter, an email to those accusing me here, in which i have written any such sentence that you should give or give the travel document to Lalit Modi
 india today ke rajdeep saradesai se lalit modi ne bhi mana he ki maine sushamaa ji ko phone kiya tha, madad maangi thi, unhone mujhapar krupa kii thi
 Lalit Modi also said that Sushma Swaraj helped me by going out of the way
 sushamaa ji khud maan rahi hai ki british ucchayukta se kaha he ki to phir chitthee yaa email kaa pramaan kisase or kyon maang rahi hai
 Well in the Lok Sabha, the foreign minister said that i did not benefit Lalit Modi
 kya ye phayda tha ki ve apni patni kii surgery ke liye sahmati patr par dastakhat kar sake
 He was in London
 surgery ke baad landan aa gaye
 What changed congress sadan main hissaa leti to kai sawaalon par baat saaf hoti lekin anand sharma ne press conference ke zariye zarur charchaa main hissaa liya
 He also brought a lot of pictures of Lalit Modi and said that if he went there on 4 August 2014, then on 6 August, the city is famous for tourism
 
 Ibiza are found in resorts

 He was traveling all over the world

 How many people are looking for the law of India, the agencies that are looking for, some people in their family will also get sick, what are the cases that after taking the ministerial berth, Sushma ji has helped them
 kitne aise maamle hai, kitni aisi yachanaayen ai jin par inhone ye nirnay liya
 On July 21, the first day of the monsoon session, Sushma Swaraj tweeted that a senior Congress leader had pressurized me to get a diplomatic passport to Santosh Bagrodio, an accused in the coal scam
 main us netaa kaa naam sadan main bhi bataaungi
 On hearing this, Santosh Bagrodia came forward and admitted that yes i had met Sushma ji for extension of my diplomatic passport in October 2014 but Sushma ji did not approve
 mere paas passport he or kisi court ne yaa sibiai ne videsh jane par roak nahin lagaai he
 i went to the United States in May to treat my wife
 meri patni bhi cancer kii mariz he
 While the Health Minister in the Vajpayee government, Sushma ji had approved to go to America for government treatment at the expense of my wife
 sushamaa swaraj ne iconomik times kii khabar kaa bhi hawala diya jisamen england ke grih vibhaag ne mana he ki lalit modi ko yatra dastauez dene main niyamon kaa ullaghann nahin hua he
 The Congress alleges that the British government will make the document only by rules, but why did Sushma give a relaxation on the level of foreign policy to make it
 khayr sushamaa swaraj ne kaha ki kaise kiya, kyon kiya se pehle ye to bataa do kya kiya
 Anand Sharma said that on 3 July 2014, when a London official told him in writing that Lalit Modi's application has been rejected, there is a second attempt
 lalit modi ne sushamaa ji se baat kii or uske baad kith vaaz ko kaha ki bharat ke videsh mantri ye kehane ko taiyaar hai ki bharat kii sarkaar ko koi aapatti nahin he
 Paper should be given kith vaaz ne patr ke dwaara vahaan kii sabase badi border authority adhikari jinka kaam passport, visa, travel document dena he, unhen isaki soochna di
 He gave her in writing that Sushma ji has no objection to this, she supports it, i have spoken to her
 tippaniyan Anand Sharma's question is why Sushma Swaraj gave her response without asking any official of the UK government
 british ucchayukta se kahana ki yatra dastauez de dijie hamaare sambandhon par asar nahin padegaa isse badi koi sifarish ho sakati he
 The whole matter that the Ministry of Finance of India was not even aware of the High Commissioner of India in the UK
 sushamaa swaraj kahati hai ki patni ke ilaaj ke liye maanavtaa ke aadhaar par madad kii
 Anand Sharma says that in the application for the travel document, Lalit Modi wrote three reasons that one has to visit the President of Seychelles, sister is married, wife is treated
 ilaaj tisare number par he
 So Sushma Swaraj's statement ends the matter or starts once again
 yahi wo log hai jo sushamaa ji se sneh rakhte hai magar in dinon grah ke kaaran istipha maang rahe hai
 If seen, this planet is as much anti-sushma and equally anti-sonia
 iske kaaran sushamaa ji ko apyash mil rahaa he to sonia ji kii party kii bhi kam badanaami nahin ho rahi he
 It has to be ascertained whether it is Rahu Ketu or Rahul Sonia

 He gave her in writing that Sushma ji has no objection to this, she supports it, i have spoken to her

 british ucchayukta se kahana ki yatra dastauez de dijie hamaare sambandhon par asar nahin padegaa isse badi koi sifarish ho sakati he
 The whole matter that the Ministry of Finance of India was not even aware of the High Commissioner of India in the UK

 vaise videsh mantri ne kaha he ki agar charchaa ho to ve baaki sawaalon kaa jawaab bhi vistaar se dengi to charchaa se pehle is bayaan kii kya zarurat thi
 Whether this statement should be considered final until discussed
 kya sarkaar ne is bayaan ke zariye antim sandesh de diya ki monsoon kya sheetakaaleen satr bhi barbaad kar dekh lijie hamane apni safai de di he
 It is true that Sushma Swaraj was ready to discuss and answer the allegations from the first day of the monsoon session
 guuruuvaar ko bhi unhone kaha ki lagbhag 2 maah se media ke madhyam se mere kilaaf kuprachaar chal rahaa he
 But i sat calmly waiting for the monsoon session of Parliament that the session of Parliament would begin, the subject would be discussed and i would answer every question in detail
 vaise sushamaa swaraj monsoon satr se pehle or iske dauraan bhi twitor ke zariye is masale main kuch na kuch bayaan to de hi rahi thim
 On August 2, he tweeted that i neither requested nor proposed to the British government for Lalit Modi's travel document
 jabaki is maamle ke saamne aate hi unhone 13 june ko 12 baar twit kar kaha tha ki With a humanitarian view, i told the British High Commissioner that the British government should consider Lalit Modi's prayer under British rules
 agar british sarkaar yatra dastauez dene kaa faisla karti he to hamaare sambandhon par asar nahin padegaa
 He himself has said that he spoke to the British High Commissioner and should consider the application of Lalit Modi
 lekin loksabhaa main videsh mantri kahati hai ki main puri zimmedaari ke saath kahana chaahati hum ki ye aarope saraasal galat he asaty he niraadhaar he
 i never requested the British government to give a travel document to Lalitji
 aapako maaloom he ki anurodh or sifarish patron kii ek bhashaa hoti he
 i challenge you to submit a paper, a slip, a letter, an email to those accusing me here, in which i have written any such sentence that you should give or give the travel document to Lalit Modi
 india today ke rajdeep saradesai se lalit modi ne bhi mana he ki maine sushamaa ji ko phone kiya tha, madad maangi thi, unhone mujhapar krupa kii thi
 Lalit Modi also said that Sushma Swaraj helped me by going out of the way
 sushamaa ji khud maan rahi hai ki british ucchayukta se kaha he ki to phir chitthee yaa email kaa pramaan kisase or kyon maang rahi hai

 On July 21, the first day of the monsoon session, Sushma Swaraj tweeted that a senior Congress leader had pressurized me to get a diplomatic passport to Santosh Bagrodio, an accused in the coal scam

 On hearing this, Santosh Bagrodia came forward and admitted that yes i had met Sushma ji for extension of my diplomatic passport in October 2014 but Sushma ji did not approve
 mere paas passport he or kisi court ne yaa sibiai ne videsh jane par roak nahin lagaai he
 i went to the United States in May to treat my wife

 maanavtaavaadi khyaal se maine british ucchayukta se kaha ki british sarkaar ko british niyamon ke tahat lalit modi kii prarthana par vichaar karnaa chahie
 If the British Government decides to give a travel document, our relations will not be affected
 khud hi kaha he ki unhone british ucchayukta se baat kii lalit modi kii arzi par vichaar karnaa chahie
 But the External Affairs Minister in the Lok Sabha says that i want to say with full responsibility that this allegation is completely false and is untrue
 maine kabhi bhi british sarkaar se lalit ji ko yatra dastauez dene kaa anurodh nahin kiya
 You know that request and recommendation letters have a language
 main chunauti detii hum ki ek kaagaj ek parchi ek chitthee ek email mere par aarope lagane vaale yahaan par prastut kar den jisamen maine aisa koi bhi vaakya likhaa ho ki lalit modi ko travel dacument de dijie yaa aapako dene chahie
 Lalit Modi from Rajdeep Sardesai of India Today has also admitted that i had called Sushma ji, asked for help, he was kind to me
 lalit modi ne yah bhi kaha ki sushamaa swaraj ne out aaf da ve jaakar meri madad kii
 Sushma ji herself is agreeing that she has asked the British High Commissioner, to whom and why is she asking for proof of the letter or email
 khayr loksabhaa main videsh mantri ne kaha ki maine lalit modi ko koi phayda nahin pahunchaaya
 Was it an advantage that he could sign the consent letter for his wife's surgery
 ve landan main the
 Moved to London after surgery

 If the Congress had participated in the House, many questions would have been clear but Anand Sharma definitely participated in the discussion through a press conference
 lalit modi kii bahut sari tasviren bhi le aae or kaha ki 4 agast 2014 ko agar ye vahaan gaye hai to 6 agast ko paryaton ke liye mashhoor shahar he

 There are so many such cases, how many such petitions came on which they took this decision
 monsoon satr ke pehle din yani 21 july ko sushamaa swaraj ne twit kiya ki ek varisht congress netaa ne mujh par dabaav banaaya tha ki main koyala ghotaale main aaropee santosh bagrodeo ko diplomatic passport dilava duun
 i will tell the name of that leader in the House also
 yah sunate hi santosh bagrodia saamne aae or sweekaar kiya ki haa maine sushamaa ji se aktubar 2014 main apane diplomatic passport ke vistaar ke liye mila tha lekin sushamaa ji ne manzuri nahin di
 i have a passport and no court or CBI has barred me from going abroad
 main may june main apni patni ke ilaaj ke liye america gaya tha
 My wife is also a patient of cancer
 vaajapeyi sarkaar main swasth mantri rahete hue sushamaa ji ne meri patni ke ilaaj ke liye sarkari kharch par america jane kii manzuri di thi 
 Sushma Swaraj also cited the Economic Times news in which the Home Department of England has admitted that there has been no violation of rules in giving travel documents to Lalit Modi
 congress kaa aarope he ki britain kii sarkaar to niyam se hi dastauez banaaegi lekin use banane ke liye videsh niti ke str par sushamaa ne chhot kyon di
 Well, Sushma Swaraj said how did she do it, why tell me what she did before
 anand sharma ne bataate hue kaha ki 3 july 2014 ko jab landan ke adhikari ne likhit main bataa diya ki lalit modi kii arzi riject ho gai he to dobaaraa prayaas hota he
 Lalit Modi spoke to Sushma ji and then told Keith Vaz that the Foreign Minister of India was ready to say that the Government of India had no objection
 kagaz de die jaae
 Keith Vaz informed this by letter to the biggest border authority officials whose job is to give passport, visa, travel document
 unhone us par likhit main diya ki sushamaa ji ko isse koi aapatti nahin he, wo iskaa samarthan karti he, meri unase baat hui he
 The comments anand sharma kaa sawaal he ki sushamaa swaraj ne britain kii sarkaar ke kisi adhikari ke bina puche apni pratikriya kyon di thi
 Telling the British High Commissioner that give travel documents will not affect our relations, there can be a big recommendation
 is puure maamle ki bharat ke videsh mantralay vitt mantralay britain main bharat ke ucchayukta ko jaankaree tak nahin thi
 Sushma Swaraj says that for the treatment of the wife helped on the basis of humanity
 anand sharma kehete hai ki lalit modi ne yatra dastauez ke liye jo arzi lagaai thi usamen teen kaaran likhe ki ek sichelles ke raashtrapati se milane janaa he, bahan kii shaadi he, patni kaa ilaaj bhi he
 Treatment is at number three
 to sushamaa swaraj ke is bayaan se maamla khatm hota he yaa ek baar phir se shuru ho jaataa he
 He himself has said that he spoke to the British High Commissioner and should consider the application of Lalit Modi
 lekin loksabhaa main videsh mantri kahati hai ki main puri zimmedaari ke saath kahana chaahati hum ki ye aarope saraasal galat he asaty he niraadhaar he
 i never requested the British government to give a travel document to Lalitji
 aapako maaloom he ki anurodh or sifarish patron kii ek bhashaa hoti he
 i challenge you to submit a paper, a slip, a letter, an email to those accusing me here, in which i have written any such sentence that you should give or give the travel document to Lalit Modi
 india today ke rajdeep saradesai se lalit modi ne bhi mana he ki maine sushamaa ji ko phone kiya tha, madad maangi thi, unhone mujhapar krupa kii thi
 Lalit Modi also said that Sushma Swaraj helped me by going out of the way

 suicide karne kii kai ghatnaon ke bare main aapane suna hoga
 But in Bindapur area of south-west Delhi, a youth committed suicide along with a suicide note
 suicide ke liye usne apane pita or chachaa ko jimmedaar bataaya
 The deceased young man was so upset by his father's indifference that he hugged the gallows while talking on the phone to his father living in Italy
 philhal police maamle kii tafteesh main juty hui he
 Just 23-year-old Mayur Puri had a lot of laughs like other youths
 uske parivaar main saadhan bhi tha, bas nahin tha to apane pita kaa pyaar, haalanki uske pita italy main rahete hai
 But what happened to Mayur's father and mother was that he moved to Italy after a few years of marriage
 is bich ve apane parivaar kaa koi khyaal nahin rakhte the, bas isi baat se mayur or uski maa behad pareshaan rahete the
 Loneliness grew so much that Mayur's mother gave her life and then Mayur
 mayur ke rishtedaaron kaa aarope he ki wo behad pareshaan ho gaya, to italy jane ke liye pita se pachaas hajaar rupee maang rahaa tha
 But the father was not giving
 pita ke saath-saath usne haryana main rah rahe apane chachaa se bhi madad maangi, lekin vahaan se bhi koi madad nahin mili
 According to the information, late Monday night he was talking to his father on the phone, but in the morning his body was found hanging from the fan
 kaan main lead lagi thi laptop on tha
 He has also written suicide notes on paper and on the wall
 jisamen apni roti hui tasviir ke saath suicide ke liye apane pita sanjeev kumaar or chachaa rajeev kumaar ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 In the suicide note, he has demanded justice, as well as an apology to his old grandmother
 mritak ke rishtedaar surendar sharma ne bataaya ki uske pita bahut pehle hi italy chale gaye the
 His mother was fascinated for money, both mother and son were very upset
 pehle maa mar gayi ab isane aatmahatya kar lee
 She has made her own cry in the suicide note
 philhal police maamle kii tafteesh main jute gayi he or uskaa kahana he ki wo mritak ke pita ko italy phone kar rahe hai, lekin duusari taraf se phone uthaakar kaat diya jaataa he, police mritak ke chachaa ko bhi talash rahi he
 Mayur's body has been sent for post mortem, the family members of the deceased are also accused of laxity in the case
 kyonki suicide kii jaankaree ke baad police kii dhilaai is baat se pataa chalati he ki use divaar par likhaa suicide note bhi najar nahin aayaa or na hi us kamare kii thik se chaanbin kii, jisamen suicide note mila
 Later, the family gave these notes to the police, although the police have also taken mobile and laptop in their possession
 poonch hamale par jis bayaan ko lekar bijepi ab tak raksha mantri e ke antni ko gherti ai, ab khud bhi usee siyaasi bayaanbaji ke daldal main fansati najar aa rahi he
 The reason for this is the statement of the party's leader Gopinath Munde in which he said that the Kundlik, an Indian Army soldier, was killed in the terrorist attack on the Pakistan border
 jaise hi munde ne ye bayaan diya ensipi ne unpar dhaava bol diya
 Now NCP is asking for forgiveness from them
 ensipi ne bijepi par doharaa ravaiya apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 NCP said, 'BJP did not allow Parliament to run for two days over Antony's apology on such a statement
 shahid maane kii maut pakistan border nahin balki elosi par hui thi
 Now what will BJP say? BJP should apologize for Munde's statement
 'darasal, gopinath munde kolhapur main shahid kundali maane ke antim-sanskaar main shaamil hone gaye the
 He said these things only during this time
 shaheedon par siyasat kaa silsilaa yaheen nahin thama
 The NCP has also targeted Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan for not attending the funeral of the martyr
 party ne kaha he ki rajkeey sammaan ke kuch protocol hote hai
 The protocol was followed
 par rajya ke mukhyamantri ko naitik taur par aana chahie tha
 Significantly, the rhetoric on martyrdom started on Tuesday with the defense minister's statement in which he said that 'the attackers had come in the uniform of Pak Army'
 bijepi ne is par kadaa aitraaj jataate hue kaha tha ki aisa kahana pakistani sena ko clinit dena he
 However, amidst all-round pressure, the Defense Minister on Thursday admitted in Parliament that the attack on the Chakkan da Bagh outpost, in which five Indian soldiers were martyred, was carried out by the Pakistani Army

 Often people get confused on the Cabinet and the Council of Ministers
 isi tarah cabinet ministar or swatantra prabhaar mantri kaa turm bhi kai baar logon ko sanshay main daal detaa he
 Let us know how these terms are defined differently
 mantriparishaddchounchil of ministersora mantrimandal ko saamaanya rup se Cabinet ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The Council of Ministers is a kind of joint body, which includes all types of ministers
 cabinet ministar bhi iskaa hissaa hote hai
 But the cabinet has the largest number of ministers, not all ministers are involved
 cabinet ke paas hoti he sabase zyada shaktisaamaanya tareeke se kaha jaae to pradhanmantri or uski cabinet yani mantrimandal desh kii sarkaar chalaati he
 He is appointed by the President but with the advice of the Prime Minister
 cabinet mantriyon ko mukhya or mahatvapurn mantralay die jate hai
 The cabinet receives this special power-based policy and has the right to decide on foreign affairs
 desh kii sabhi apatkaaleen paristhatiyon se nipatane kaa kaam karti haraashtrapati kii salaahkaari sanstha raashtrapati ko isse paraamarsh lenaa jaruri hacendre sarkaar kaa mukhya ang he jo niti nirdharak kii shrenee main aata haimantri parishad yani mantriyon kaa samoohmantri parishad ek tarah se kareeb 70 tak mantriyon kaa bada nikaay (body) he
 Their functions are determined by the Cabinet
 parishad main cabinet ke alaava rajyamantri va upamantri aate hai
 The accountability of the council has been fixed for the Lok Sabha
 bas yah jarur he ki council kaa koi samuhik kaary nahin he
 Size of Council of Ministers not fixed in the law Article 74 and 75 of the constitution has detailed the Council of Ministers
 lekin isamen yah tay nahin he ki iskaa aakaar kitna bada yaa chota ho
 The Prime Minister constitutes this according to the time and situation
 rajya mantri (swatantra prabhaar) ke bare main bhi janeloksabhaa ke gathan main chaar tarah ke mantri hote hai
 Among them, cabinet ministers are the most powerful
 duusare str par rajya mantri (swatantra prabhaar) aate hai
 They handle ministries independently, they are not interfered with by cabinet like the ministers of the third and fourth categories
 tisare number par rajya mantri or chauthe up mantri hote hai
 The cabinet meets in the meeting
 The Minister of State for Independent Charge is definitely involved in the cabinet meeting called for any kind of decisions of the party
 iske alaava agar kisi mantralay se sambandhit vishay par baat hoti he to usase sambandhit rajyamantri bhi hissaa lete hai
 India's foreign minister Sushma Swaraj gave diplomatic advice to women trying to convince their families for jobs
 sushamaa ne mahilaon ko salaah dete hue kaha ki wo apane parivaar ko thik usee tarah samajhaayen-bujhaaen jaise doklam gatirodh ke vakt bharat ne china ke saath kiya tha
 In fact, during the Women's Town Hall program organized by the ruling BJP in Gujarat, the usual question was what should be done in such a situation if the family does not allow the job? To this, Sushma said that family members should explain how a working woman benefits the family
 unhone kaha ki agar phir bhi parivaar ke sadsy nahin samajhate to unhen vaise hi samajhaana chahie jaise bharat ne doklam ke mudde par china ko samajhaayaa tha
 Significantly, the long-standing Doklam standoff between China and India was resolved in a friendly manner
 sushamaa ne bataae mahilaon se jude hai ye teen bade muddesushamaa ne kaha ki mahilaon ke muddon ko vyapak taur par teen shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he- suraksha se jude mudde, aazaadee se jude mudde or shashaktikaran se jude mudde
 He said that the first issue related to the safety of the girl child is whether the society will allow her to be born? i do not understand why in this country, where we worship women as goddesses, where two Navratris are celebrated, people still kill the child in the womb
 sushamaa ne kaha ki desh main kai kanoon hai lekin pradhanmantri kaa maananaa he ki ab bhi ekasaamaajik abhiyaanshuru karne kii jarurat he, kyonki is buraai se ladane ke liye sirf kanoon kaaphi nahin he
 We have launched Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme in a big way in the country
 sushamaa ne kaha ki centre evam rajyon main sarkaron ne mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye kai kadam uthaae hai
 The Union Minister said that the Modi government has also taken several steps to ensure financial independence of women, such as loans given to them under the Mudra Yojana
 sushamaa boleen- videsh mantri ke taur par apane kaam se santusht huunsushamaa ne kaha ki videsh mantri ke taur par wo apane kaam ko lekarsantushtaai, kyonki vah vibhinn deshon main fanse 88,302 bharatiyon ko surakshit waapas laane main kaamyaab rahi hai
 When a woman asked about Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's statement that there is no participation of women in the RSS, Sushma said that there was no need to reply to this comment
 rahul ne kaha tha ki aresas main kitni mahilaayein hai, aapane kabhi aresas kii shakhaon main kisi mahila ko nikkar pahane dekha he? sushamaa ne rahul ke bayaan ko abhadra qaraar diya
 He said that i also think like you
 yah tippanee itani abhadra he ki main jawaab dena nahin chaahuungi
 Let us know that recently the Congress accused the BJP-RSS of being anti-women
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul ne na sirf aresas main mahilaon kii hissedari balki aresas kii aadhikarik poshaak (half pant) ko lekar bhi tikhi tippanee kii thi
 He said at the Vadodara rally, his (BJP) organization is RSS
 kitni mahilaayein hai usamen, kabhi shakha main mahilaon ko dekha he shorts main? maine to nahin dekha
