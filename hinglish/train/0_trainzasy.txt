 The question is why the Indian Army presented it as an incident of infiltration? Also, why did the army claim to have killed the terrorists, while not a single body was recovered from the spot? At present, the Indian Army has refused to confirm the news

 Four months and a fifth head
 21 agast 2014 ko jab aatankwaadi sanghathanaiessane america patrkaar james phole kaa sir kalam karne kaa video jari kiya to puri duniya sann rah gai thi
 This was the first picture of ISIS to kill someone innocent
 iske baad duusari tasviir ai
 Then the third and fourth
 or ab wo paanchavin tasviir bhi aa hi gai, jise lekar har koi sahamaa hua tha
 In this fifth and new video, a US Ed activist, Peter Cassing, is beheaded
 insaaniyat ke gale main churi chalaane kaa ye silsilaa kab or kahaan jaakar khatm hoga, philhal ye koi nahin jaanata
 The terrorists finally vindicated their threat, which was given on 3 October, during the beheading of British hostage Alan Hanning
 isse pehle hui sir kalam karne kii tamaam vaardaaton kii tarah hi is baar bhi kaale kapade main ek nakaabposh aatankwaadi ko cassing ko pakadaa dikhaaya jaataa he
 Cassing is sitting on his knees in orange clothes, while a terrorist with a knife in his hand is seen standing behind
 ye aatankwaadi pehle to british lahaze main angreji bol kar iraq main iesas par kiye ja rahe hamalon kaa virodh karata he or phir america or britain ko chetavanee dete hue cassing kaa sir dhad se alag kar detaa he
 Although this time the US investigative agency has claimed to have identified the masked terrorists, it is also believed that the incident was carried out in the area of northern Syria
 video main cassing akelaa nahinis baar is video main cassing akelaa nahin he balki usase pehle aatankwaadiyon ko takreeban 12 iraqi phogiyon kaa sir kalam karte hue dikhaaya gaya he
 Even before this orgy of death, terrorists warn America and Britain, and they also take the head of the soldiers, threatening to kill the American soldiers in the same manner
 antarrashtriya samudaay jahaan iesas kii ore se jari kiye gaye is taaja video kii nae sire se tasdik karne main juta he, vahiin ab tak jari kiye gaye video or katl ke silsile ko dekhte hue takreeban puri duniya hi ye maan kar chal rahi he ki peter cassing ab is duniya main nahin he
 26-year-old Peter Cassing, who hails from the Indiana Polis area of the US, was abducted by ISIS militants last year when he was helping Syrian migrants in Turkey on behalf of US Aid
 iske baad duusare bandhakon kii tarah cassing ke gharavaalon ne bhi apane bete ko baksh dene kii guhaar lagaai thi
 What is the truth of Jihadi John, from American journalist James Foley to US Ed activist Peter Cassing
 iesas ke gumnaam thikaanon main jo haath ek ke baad ek begunaahon kaa sir kalam karte rahe
 After all, whose hands are those? Who is that masked person who is going to pen his head in front of the camera with a dagger in his hand? If sources are to be believed, his name is Jihadi John
 lekin ab khabar ye aa rahi he ki pichley dinon ek hawaii hamale main jon buree tarah jakhmi ho gaya he or maut kii kagaar par he
 In these pictures that rocked the world, every time the head was cut off, of course, it was of a new person, but these hands were the same person every time
 apane sir kalam karne kii sanak ke chalate duniya bhar main badnaam jihadi jon kii asaliyat tab pehali baar jamaane ke saamne ai, jab iesas ne begunaahon ko markar america or britain ko chetane ke silsile main 21 agast ko pehali baar patrkaar james phole kaa sir kalam kiye jane kaa video jari kiya
 In fact, before this video, jihadist John opposed the attacks on ISIS
 lekin apane chehre par nakaab lagaae rakhane ke baavjood suraksha agenciyon ne use uski aawaaj or angreji bolne ke andaaj se pahchaan liya
 Cameron's desire to capture John: Amid reports of John's injuries, British Prime Minister David Cameron has once again expressed his desire to hold John alive
 camerun ne kaha he ki jihadi jon jis tarah begunaahon ko maut ke ghat utaarata rahaa he, use dekhte hue use maarane kii bajaay pakad kar kanoon kii adaalat main pesh kiya janaa zyada jaruri he
 So that he can be properly punished for all his crimes
 camerun kaa ye bayaan tab aayaa he, jab britain se badi taadaad main kattar jehniyat vaale naujavaanon ke iesas main shaamil hone ke liye desh chhodkar iraq kaa rukh karne kii khabaren saamne ai hai
 However, the British government itself has confirmed this and said that so far around 500 British youth have secretly left for Iraq and Syria to join ISIS
 pradhanmantri camerun ne aise naujavaanon samet aatankwaadi banane ke khwaahishamand ladakon ko aagaah karte hue kaha he ki aisa karne kaa anjaam yakeenan bura hi hoga
 The jihadist John of course beheading the camera, but Baghdadi always dictates raising a dagger
 bagdadi yani duniya ke sabase amir aatankwaadi sanghathan kaa sargana
 The Most Wanted Terrorist in the World, After al-qaeda Chief Al Jawahri
 aage padhein, kya he bagdadi kaa asal makasad
 
 
 The real purpose of Baghdadi, after al-qaeda chief Al Jawhari, is that the biggest identity of this most wanted terrorist of the world is that he likes to be venerated
 lekin nakaab ke peeche rahakar bhi is shaks ne ab tak jo katl-o-gaarat machaai he, uske bare main sun kar rongte khadey ho jate hai
 On 16 May 2010, as the head of ISIS, Baghdadi, who commanded this world's richest terrorist organization, has already been the commander of Al Qaeda commander Osama bin Laden
 wo al-kaayda ke aakaa kii maut kaa badla lenaa chahta he
 Baghdadi's first motive: Baghdadi wants to capture Iraq and Syria first in order to succeed in his dangerous plan, and the truth is that he has been successful to this extent
 uske ladaakon ne syria ke kuch hisson par kabja kar rakhaa he or iske saath hi iraq ke kai shaharon par bhi iesas ke aatankwaadi kabja jamaaye baithe hai
 The Second Purpose of Baghdadi The second objective of Baghdadi is not just to conquer Iraq and Syria, but it wants to create an Islamic Emirate by combining all the Levant countries ie Cyprus, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Turkey
 bagdadi kaa teesraa makasadabagadadi kaa sapana yaheen tak mahadood nahin rahata
 After capturing these countries, it wants to capture Pakistan and Afghanistan and then spread its empire in India to the northwestern states including Gujarat
 jaankaron kii maane to bagdadi da islamic state of khorasaan bananaa chahta he or agar abu bakar al bagdadi apane makasad main kaamyaab ho gaya to yakeenan hi duniya kaa nakshaa badal jayega
 But the shocking thing is that a lot of terrorists of India have joined ISIS
 kuch maheene pehle syria ke rajdoot is baat kaa khulaasa bhi kar chuke hai ki hindustan ke jehadi unke desh me bashar sarkaar ke khilaaf jang main shaamil ho chuke hai or agar ye baat sach he to ek baat to tay he ki aane waalo vakt main iesas bharat ke liye bhi ek bada khatra ban saktaa he
 It is Abu Bakr al-baghdadi, led by ISIS militants, who not only captured the second major city of Iraq, Mosul, but in this connection the history of the world's biggest bank robbery by plundering the central bank of Mosul
 They have also named themselves
 is lut main bagdadi or uske gurgon ne 500 billian iraqi dinar yani takreeban 25 sau karod rupee batore
 The US State Department has announced a US $ 10 million reward for Abu Bakr al Baghdadi's head or address
 ye rakam al kaayda ke nae chif al javaahari ke sir par rakhe gaye 25 million yues dollar ke inaam ke baad duusari sabase badi rakam he

 The Samajwadi Party's silver jubilee celebrations at Janeshwar Mishra Park in Lucknow on Saturday aimed to celebrate 25 years of the party
 is utsav main lakhon logon kii bheed juty, purv pradhanmantri devegoda, ajit singh, abhaya chautaala, lalu yadav, sharad yadav or ram jethmalani jaise netaa bhi jute, lekin rajat jayanti samaaroh chachaa-bhattije ke bich sulah karaane kii panchayat main tabdeel ho gaya
 All leaders' advice for reconciliation did not seem to have much effect
 lalu yadav ke kehane par akhilesh yadav ne chachaa shivpal yadav ke pair to chhu liye lekin us vakt bhi donon ke haathon main talavaare chamak rahi thi, jo manch par unhen bhent kii gai thi
 Uncle Shivpal Yadav got out of his mind and said that his sacrifice and sacrifice was no match in bringing the party to this place
 bhavuk hote hue shivpal yadav ne yah bhi kaha ki unhen mukhyamantri banane kii khwaahish nahin he or jarurat padi to apana khun dene ko taiyaar hai
 It also said that in the Akhilesh Yadav government, some sycophants are enjoying power, while all the struggling people got nothing
 jab akhilesh yadav kii bolne kii baari ai, to unhone nape-tule shabdon main hi sahi, lekin jawaab de diya
 Without naming Shivpal Yadav, he said that some people would understand but by then the party would have been looted
 shivpal yadav ne mantrimandal se barkhaast hone par tanj kasate hue kaha tha kii unhen chaahe jitani baar barkhaast kiya jaae or unka chaahe jitna apmaan kiya jaae vah party ke liye kaam karte rahenge
 Akhilesh Yadav responded with a smile that the socialists offer him a sword but hope that the sword does not go away
 yah kaise ho saktaa he
 Even among the packed pandals, the factionalism of the leaders was clearly visible
 shivpal or akhilesh ke samarthak alag-alag jhund banaakar baithe the or apane netaa kaa jhanda buland karne ke liye narebaaji kaa muqabla kar rahe the
 Alam was that when Shivpal Yadav used to say that he was willing to sacrifice for the party, supporters of Akhilesh Yadav used to shout slogans, 'akhilesh Bhaiya Tere Naam Yeh Jawani Hai Kurbaan'
 akhilesh ke naam par tali bajaane vaale or naare lagane waalon ko to shivpal nahin roak paa rahe the, lekin manch par apni dhauns banaae rakhane ke liye unhone koi kasar nahin chodi
 When Javed Abdi, Akhilesh's minister of state, got an opportunity on the mic, he started reading songs in Akhilesh Yadav's glory in a loud voice
 jab bheed ne khub taaliyaan bajaanaa shuru kiya, to chachaa shivpal is kadar laal-pile hue ki javed abdi ko dhakka dekar hataa diya or mike par aakar samarthakon se anushaasan main rahane kii daant laga di
 Everyone from Deve Gowda, Lalu Yadav to Ajit Singh have advised the Samajwadi Party to unite and fight against the communal forces
 yah bhi kaha ki netaa ji ke netritv main sab log saath gathbandhan main aane ko taiyaar hai taaki bijepi ko upi par jhanda fahraane se roka ja sake
 But at the end when Mulayam Singh Yadav came to speak, the family and the party were seen wandering in the corridors of the past with their old memories instead of the chaos
 party ke saamne mandara rahe sankat ke bajaay unhone jawaharlal nehru, ram manohar lohia or raaj narayan se lekar samaajawaadee netaaon ke saath apane anubhav kii zyada charchaa kii
 When Akhilesh Yadav showed his popularity in the rath yatra two days ago, Shivpal Yadav showed his strength as the state president at the silver jubilee celebrations
 bheed to lakh se upar kii ai, lekin party main sulah hone kii raah kisi ko nahin dikhi
 People showed that only after the rally was over in Lucknow's biggest and most beautiful Janeshwar Mishra Park, there was a lot of dirt everywhere
 ronde gaye paudhe shaayad yahi soch rahe honge ki party ke ghamaasan kii keemat unhen kyon chukaani pad rahi he

 ) It has been a full seven years for the Nirbhaya case
 wo 16 disambar 2012 tha
 Today is 17 December 2019
 in saat lambey saalon main nirbhaya ke gunahagaar to apane anjaam tak nahin pahunch paae
 However, on Monday, MLA Kuldeep Sengar in Unnao rape case was declared guilty by a Delhi court of rape and kidnapping
 ab sajaa kaa elaan mangalvaar ko hoga
 But what will happen to the Nirbhaya case? After all, where is the hanging of the culprits of Nirbhaya hanging? to aaie nirbhaya cese ke saat saal puure hone ke maukey par in saat saalon kaa hisaab-kitaab dekhte hai
 From December 16, 2012 to December 17, 2019, it seemed then that it was just justice that justice was done
 baaten ho rahi thim ki dekh lenaa saal bhar ke andar lataka die jaaenge saare
 But year after year passed
 saatvaan saal aa gaya
 Perhaps this year would have passed
 kya pataa biit bhi jaae
 He was a doctor from Hyderabad and that girl from Unnao once again enraged the country, when we remembered that the gangsters of Nirbhaya have not been hanged till now
 bas phir kya tha yaad aate hi ab faansee, faansee ke tareeke, paansi ke kanoon, faansee kii taarikh faansee kii rassi, paansi kaa fanda sab par baaten hone lageen
 Why was the time taken so much, at what speed did the case move, what happened in the last seven years
 saal-dar saal isaki padtaal karen usase pehle jaruri he
 It is important that at what point the case is standing
 aage kya hoga
 How long will it be hanging kis taarikh tak faansee ho sakati he
 On which day Black Warrant will be released
 in kanoonee pahaluon ko jaan or samaj len
 At present, there are five legal hurdles between the hanging of Nirbhaya i
e
, Mukesh, Pawan, Akshay and Vinay
 pehali kanoonee adchannirbhaya kii maa ne faansee main ho rahi deree ko lekar isi saal aktubar main patiala house court main ek yachika daayar kii thi
 Hearing that petition, the Patiala House court issued notice to the DG of Tihar Jail and asked for a fresh report on the case of the four prisoners
 13 disambar ko video conferencing ke jariye chaaron doshiyon se baatcheet karne ke baad adaalat ne 18 disambar ko sunwaayee kii agali taarikh rakhi he
 The second legal hurdle is the second hitch that on December 10, another criminal Akshay had filed a review petition in the Supreme Court regarding the death sentence
 us yachika par sunwaayee ke liye supreme court ne 17 disambar dopaher do baje kaa vakt diya he
 The third legal hurdle is the third hurdle that even after the decision of the Supreme Court on December 17 will be heard in the Patiala Court on December 18
 phir patiala house court kaidiyon ke aage kii haq ke bare main koi faisla de saktaa he
 The fourth legal hitch is that the hitch is that Mukesh and Pawan should tell in front of the court that if they also appeal to the President for mercy, then it is very possible that they too get this opportunity
 isse faansee kuch or din tal sakati he
 However, it may also happen that on December 18, the court should make it clear why did you not appeal to the President for mercy for so long? And reject his application on this Binah
 yaa ye bhi ho saktaa he ki baaki donon dayaa ke liye raashtrapati ke paas jaaen hi nahin
 In such a case, it is possible that all four are hanged soon
 par ye jaldi bhi ek-do hafte kaa vakt to le hi legi
 Fifth legal hurdle, a Supreme Court judgment of 2014, cannot be hanged immediately even if the mercy petition is dismissed and the black warrant is issued
 supreme court kahata he ki blike warrant jari hone ke baad faansee par chadaaye jane vaale shaks ko kam se kam 14 din kaa vakt diya janaa chahie
 So that during this time, he can complete all his unfinished work, including making a will, meeting relatives
 is hisaab se bhi faansee main kam se ek-do hafte kaa vakt lag jayega
 By the way, all these legal hurdles are for now and for now
 ab sawaal uthta he ki nirbhaya jaise cese main jisamen fast trek court ne sirf nau maheene ke andar apana faisla suna diya tha
 Why did it take seven years to hang even after that? There is another strange aspect of this case
 ab ye ittefacan he yaa iske peeche faansee kii taarikh taalane kii sajeesh to nahin
 The four nuns of Nirbhaya have not yet exercised their last legal right or the human right to appeal to Rahm
 agar ek ne punarvichaar yachika daayar nahin kii to duusare ne raham kii apil hi nahin kii
 One of them has done nothing till now
 nirbhaya cese kaa pehla faisla fastre trek court ne sirf 9 maheene main yani 2013 main hi suna diya tha
 After this Delhi High Court also did not take much time
 saal bhar main hai court se bhi faisla aa gaya
 However, the Supreme Court must deliver the verdict for about three and a quarter years
 magar uske baad aakhri ke do saal main is cese main kuch hua nahin tha

 Seeing the video that is revealed, it is clear that the terrorists entered the concert hall from behind the stage and first of all they shot the performers who were performing on the stage
 iske baad stage par aate hi bandook kaa munh darshakon kii taraf kar unhone andhadhundh goliyaan chalaayin jab tak kii megsine khaali nahin ho gai

 According to the Belgian government, a man caught was in Paris on the evening of the blast
 iske saath hi landan airport se france ke ek naagarik ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 Police have also recovered weapons from this person
 police jaanch kar rahi he ki kya ye shaks paris hamale main shaamil tha yaa nahin
 Since the attack, the Paris Police's strategy of overcoming the terrorists has been extremely agile
 raashtrapati francwa oland ne saaf sanket die the ki hamalon kii sajeesh videsh main rachi gai lekin hamale ko anjaam dene ke liye local modul kaa ismetal hua
 The police have recovered a carriage near the Neconsert Hall which has a Belgian registration number

 When the moon completely covers the sun, it is called a full solar eclipse, when the moon partially covers it, it is called a partial solar eclipse
 kya kah rahaa he jyotish21 agast ko lagane vaale surya grahan kaa prabhaav un logon par ho saktaa he jinaki rahu yaa ketu kii mahadasha yaa antaradasha chal rahi he yaa jinaki kundali main grahan dosha he, jinaki kundali main chandramaa peedit he yaa jinka kark lagn he aise logon ko bhi ye grahan prabhavit kar saktaa he
 According to astrology, what to do? The eclipse of the sun will only affect its people in India, whose horoscope is the Mahadasha or Antaradha of Rahu or Ketu
 yadi aapaki kundali main grahan dosha he yaa rahu, ketu kii dasha chal rahi he to grahan ke samay havan karen or grahan ke samaapt hone par snaan karke garibon ko khaane-pine kii chijen daan karen
 If the arrangement of the Havan is not being done, then during the eclipse, chant 'om Namah Shivaya', you will benefit from it

 First day of Team India's 500th Test
 jaahir he khaas to hona hi tha
 This historic match started on time, amidst fears of rain on the Green Park ground in Kanpur
 darshakon kaa utsaah charam par tha
 The BCCI had made special arrangements to make the match special
 is avasar par bhartiya test cricket itihaas ke kai captainon ko sammanit bhi kiya gaya
 This special match started after which the audience was eagerly waiting
 yadi pehle din ke khel par najar daali jaae, to team india ke liye yah milajula rahaa
 However he took 3 in the 90 overs of the day
 23 ke ranret se 9 wicket par 291 jode, jo ek lihaaj se thikthak score he
 Nevertheless, Virat Kohli, the favorite of the audience, disappointed him
 kohli ke paas is match ko or yaadgaar banane kaa mauka 49wein over main 154 ke score par pujaara ke out hone ke baad mila, lekin vah vijay ke saath 13 ran jodakar pavilion laut gaye
 He started well
 do chauke bhi lagaae the, lekin pari ko aage nahin le ja sake
 Before them, opener Lokesh Rahul, who has shown a brilliant game so far in both Test and T20, scored fast, but this time he could not play big innings
 unhone 39 gendon main 32 ran thoke
 The highlight of the day's play was the innings of Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara
 gauratlab he ki in donon hi khilaadiyon ke sthaan ko lekar charchaa joro par thi
 We had seen this in the Windies when Kohli thought it better to take out of form Shikhar Dhawan in place of Vijay in the playing XI and gave importance to Rohit Sharma in place of Pujara
 haalanki isaki aalochana hone ke baad unhone kanpur main jahaan dhawan ko baahar kiya, vahiin rohit sharma ke moh se batch nahin paae or paanch kii jagah chaar gendbaajon lete hue rohit ko rakh liya
 Both Vijay and Pujara showed their classical batting on a slow and difficult looking wicket and proved the captain's earlier decisions wrong, leaving an indelible mark
 vijay ne 170 gendon kaa saamana kiya or 65 ran banaae, jabaki pujaara ne 109 gendon main 62 ran thoke
 The number of balls indicated that both batsmen showed the traditional game in Tests and gave evidence of being technically proficient
 duusari ore rohit sharma ne hameshaa kii tarah acchhee shuruyaat kii or 35 ran jode, lekin phir unka chirparichit laaparvaahibhara shot aayaa or vah chalate bane
 Meaning Rohit once again got stuck throwing wickets
 unki isi kamajori kii aalochana hoti rahi he, kyonki unke tallent ko lekar kisi ko andeh nahin he
 Yes, r Ashwin once again shined with the bat and scored 40 runs to bring relief to the team in the lower middle order, as the New Zealand bowlers appeared to dominate the middle
 tippaniyan Talking about New Zealand bowling, their spinners bowled well and took the test of Indian batsmen
 kai najdiki maamle bhi rahe
 Spinner Mitchell Santner was particularly upset
 kanpur ke wicket par kii baar halki dhul bhi uthati dikhi
 Santner also took advantage of this and took India's first two wickets
 pehle din unke naam 20 over main 3 wicket rahe
 Born at the other end, India-born Ish Sodhi supported him well
 haalanki vah ek wicket hi le paae
 In the final session, Trent Boult took a brilliant fast bowling view and took 3 wickets
 bolt ne inaswing ke saath-saath dhimi gendon kaa bhi bakhubi istemaal kiya, jinhen bhartiya ballebaaj pard nahin paae
 Overall, on the first day, Team India did not play as expected and looked back from a big target
 aise main newjiland ke paas ballebaaji main behatar karke bharat par dabaav banane kaa mauka ban gaya he
 Crease is currently Ravindra Jadeja and Umesh Yadav
 
 
 dekhne vaali baat hogi ki duusare din bharat apni pehali pari ko kab tak khinch paata he
 If we look at the first day's play, it was mixed for Team India
 haalanki din ke nirdhaarit 90 over main usne 3
 291 for 9 wickets with a runrate of 23, which is a decent score in a sense
 phir bhi darshakon ke chahete viraat kohli ne unako niraash kiya
 Kohli had the chance to make the match more memorable after Pujara was dismissed for 154 in the 49th over, but he returned to the pavilion with Vijay adding 13 runs
 unhone shuruyaat acchhee kii thi
 Two fours were also hit, but could not take the innings further
 unase pehle test or tii-20 donon main ab tak shandaar khel dikhaane vaale openar lokesh rahul ne teji se ran banaae, lekin is baar badi pari nahin khel paae
 He scored 32 runs in 39 balls
 din ke khel kaa aakarshan murali vijay or cheteshwar pujaara kii paariyaan raheen
 Significantly, the discussion about the location of both these players was in full swing
 windies main ham iskaa najaara dekh chuke the, jab kohli ne vijay kii jagah out of form shikhar dhawan ko plaing ilevan main lenaa behatar samajha tha or pujaara kii jagah rohit sharma ko mahatv diya tha
 However, after being criticized, where he dropped Dhawan in Kanpur, Rohit could not escape Sharma's fascination and took four bowlers instead of five and kept Rohit
 vijay or pujaara donon ne dhime or mushkil dikh rahe wicket par apni clasical batting kaa najaara pesh kiya or amit chhap chhodte hue captain ke pehle ke faislon ko galat sabit kar diya
 Vijay faced 170 balls and scored 65 runs, while Pujara scored 62 runs in 109 balls
 gendon kii sankhya bataati he ki donon ne hi ballebaajon ne test main paramparaagat khel dikhaaya or takneekee rup se daksh hone kaa saboot diya
 On the other hand, Rohit Sharma started off as usual and added 35 runs, but then his well-known carefree shot came and he kept going
 matlab rohit ek baar phir jamane ke baad wicket phenk baithe
 His weakness has been criticized, because there is no doubt about his talent
 haa, aar aswin ne ek baar phir balle se chamak dikhaai or 40 ran banaate hue nichle madhyakram main team ko raahat pahunchaai, kyonki newjiland ke gendbaaj bich-bich main haaavee hote dikhe
 The comments newjiland ke gendbaaji kii baat karen, to unke spinneron ne acchhee gendbaaji kii or bhartiya ballebaajon kii pariksha lee
 There were also many close cases
 khaastaur se spinner michel santner ne khaasaa pareshaan kiya
 Light dust also appeared on the Kanpur wicket
 santner ne iskaa phayda bhi uthaaya or bharat ke shuruaati do wicket jatke
 He had 3 wickets in 20 overs on the first day
 duusare chor se bharat main janme ish sodhi ne unka acha saath diya
 However, he could take only one wicket
 antim satr main trent bolt ne shandaar tej gendbaaji kaa najaara pesh kiya or 3 wicket jhatak liye
 Bolt used inswing as well as slow balls, which the Indian batsmen could not read
 kul milakar pehle din team india ne ummid ke anuroop khel nahin dikhaaya or bade lakshya se peeche dikh rahi he
 In such a situation, New Zealand has a chance to put pressure on India by doing better in batting
 krij abhi rabindra jadeja or umesh yadav hai

 madhyakram ke ballebaaj suresh raina ne somvaar ko yahaan kaha ki england ke haathon pichley saal uski sarajameen par 0-4 kii karaari shikast jhelane ke baad ab bharat kii baari he ki vah agle maheene ahmedabad main shuru hone vaali chaar test maichon kii shrinkhalaa main english team ko vaisaa hi dard de
 Raina, who is leading India a in a three-day warm-up game against England starting on Tuesday, said, "I was in England then and i understand the pain of losing the series 0-4
" main chahta hum ki ham bhi unhen isi tarah ke dard kaa ahsaas karaaen
 Raina believes that the use of SG balls in the upcoming Test series will help Indian fast bowlers
 unhone kaha, ‘esji test or duk gendon main bada antar hota he
 We have bowlers like Zak (zaheer Khan) and Umesh Yadav who know how to reverse swing the SG test ball
 kolkata or mumbai jaise shaharon main jahaan umas rahati he vahaan esji test gend se sahi upyog karnaa mahatvapurn hoga
 Raina said, 'we have good spinners like Ravichandran: Ashwin and Pragyan Ojha
 england ke paas steven fin, stuart broad or james anderson jaise achche tej gendbaaj hai lekin yah is par nirbhar karata he ki ve esji test gend kaa kaise upyog karte hai
 The 25-year-old batsman is in the race for number six along with his 'ideal player' Yuvraj Singh but he said it is the job of the selectors to fill it
 raina ne kaha, ‘yuvaraj ne abhi gambhir beemaari se ubarkar vaapasi kii he
 He is an ideal player for me
 main unhen test team main vaapasi karte hue dekhnaa chahta hum
 i also want to play at that place
 main england ke khilaaf chaaron test maichon main khelnaa chahta hum
 But i do not want to spend my mind on who will get this place
 yah chayankartaaon par nirbhar karata he ki vah kiskaa chayan karte hai
 Regarding the practice match, he said, 'this match is very important for me
 yadi main yahaan ran banaata hum to isse mujhe madad milegi lekin yadi main nahin bana paata to yah chayankartaaon par nirbhar karegaa
 If i do well here, i will play the next four Tests
 ’praveen aamare se liye tipsraina ne bataaya ki unhone england ke aaf spinner greem swaan se nibatane ke liye purv test ballebaaj praveen aamare se tips liye hai
 Swann continues to harass Raina before this
 unhone kaha, ‘maine unase swaan ke bare main baat kii
 He troubled me a lot in England and was dismissed four or five times
 unhone mujhe bataaya ki main apana kandhaa gend se upar rakhun or meri nigahen gend kii line par honi chahie
 If India are to retain their claim in the three-match series after losing by an innings margin at Centurion, they will have to draw inspiration from the hosts' poor performance at the ground in the second Test starting at Kingsmead, Durban from 26 December
 
 shrinkhalaa main pehle hi 0-1 se pichad rahi bhartiya team ko ummid hogi ki vah bhi kingsmid par dakshin africa kii kamajoriyon ko ujagar karte hue shrinkhalaa main barabari paane main safal rahegaa
 South Africa have won 13 of the 37 matches played on this ground, but have also suffered defeat in 11 matches
 is maidan par austrailia or england ne dakshin africa ko paanch-paanch baar shikast di he jabaki pakistan bhi ek baar mejabaan team ko haraane main safal rahaa he
 On the other hand, however, India's record on this ground is also not very good and has lost two of its three matches played on this ground while one match has been drawn
 bharat ko haalanki ummid hogi ki uske tej gendbaaj is anukool pich par use kamyaabi dilaayenge jabaki centurian kii duusari pari kii safalataa ko ballebaaj aage badhayenge
 India will also hope that Zaheer Khan, who was out of the first Test due to injury, will be fit to play in Durban
 agar aisa hota he to bharat kaa gendbaaji akraman majboot hoga jo centurian main teetar bitar najar aa rahaa tha
 In batting, India will expect good performances from master blaster Sachin Tendulkar, who scored a 50th Test century at the Centurion, and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag, who scored half-centuries in the same match
 iske alaava team kii nazren madhyakram main anbhavi rahul dravid or vivies lakshmana par bhi tiki hogi jo centurian main ummiido par khare nahin utar sake
 However, the record of Indian batsmen on this ground has not been very good
 tendulkar ne yahaan bharat ke teenon maichon main shirkat kii lekin 18
 Only 93 runs at an average of 6, while Dravid has only 50 runs at an average of 16-6 in two matches here
 sahvaag ne yahaan ek match main keval aath ran banaaye paye hai jabaki dhoni ke naam ek match main 81 or lakshmana ke naam 65 ran darj hai
 On the other hand, South Africa all-rounder Jacques Kallis, who scored a double century in the first Test, enjoys this ground and has 56 here in 13 matches
 20 kii behtareen ausat se 1124 ran banaaye hai
 Apart from this, the first Test century AB de Villiers (460), Graeme Smith (449) and Ashwell Prince (350) have also got a lot of runs on this ground
 gendbaaji kii baat karen to bharat ko ummid hogi ki tej gendbaaji akraman ke agua jahir is match main khelenge jisase uski gendbaaji majboot hogi jo pehle test main bilkul bhi prabhavit nahin kar pai
 Zaheer has played a match at this ground but he was not very successful
 is tej gendbaaj ko is match main keval teen wicket mili jabaki unhone 148 ran kharch kar daale
 Apart from Zaheer, only fellow fast bowler s Sreesanth has experience of bowling on this ground
 srisanth ne yahaan ekmaatr match main aath wicket chatkaye the or team india ko unase ek baar phir achche pradarshan kii ummid hogi
 On the other hand, South African fast bowlers like the pitch here
 kallis ne yahaan 13 maichon main 18 wicket chatkaye hai jabaki del sten ke naam par chaar maichon main 16 wicket darj hai
 Apart from this, fast bowler Morne Morkel, who destroyed the Indian batting order in the first Test, has eight wickets in three matches here

 Making of Aadhar card in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh has become a difficult task, because there are not enough centers to make Aadhaar card

 The villagers told that they had come tokens earlier and hence have come to make Aadhaar cards
 ve jhole main roti lekar aae hai, kyonki yah aadhaar card unke liye jaruri jo ho gaya he
 It can be easily estimated how much trouble will be incurred by the villagers and children in getting Aadhaar
 jiladhikari tejasvi es
 Nayak said, "I am aware of people getting upset for making Aadhaar card
 aane vaale dinon main sheeghra hi logon ko is pareshaani se nijaat mili, iske prayaas honge

 aise main ye jaananaa jaruri he ki kisi aatanki ko global tebrist ghoshit karne kii kya prakriya he or isamen kya adchane aati hai
 What is the process of declaring a global terrorist? The UN Security Council decides to declare any terrorist as a global terrorist
 isamen america, china, france, britain or rus sthai sadsy, jabaki das asthai sadsy hote hai
 To declare someone a global terrorist, the consent of all permanent members is required
 sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad samiti prastaav 1267 jise iesaes or alqaida kii anumodan suchi bhi kaha jaataa he, usamen us aatanki kaa naam darj karnaa hota he
 After being named in this list, that terrorist is declared a global terrorist
 global aatanki ke saath kya hota he sulukapako bataa den ki sanyukt raashtra main ek baar agar koi antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit ho jaataa he to wo jis desh main rahata he, vahaan kii sarkaar ko fouran aise aatanki kii sampatti jabt kerani hoti he
 Also, keep an eye on it that it should not get any kind of financial help from anywhere
 global terrarist hone kaa matlab he ki masood ajahar ab sanyukt raashtra main shaamil kisi bhi desh kii seemaa main daakhil nahin ho saktaa or naa hi koi bhi desh use vija de saktaa he
 In the country where he will be, he will not be allowed to travel in any way
 global tebrist ke liye kya hai sanyukt raashtra ke niyamsanyukt raashtra ke niyamon ke mutabik jis desh main ye global tebrist rahete hai us desh par inke pratibandhon ko sakhti se lagu karne kii jimmedaari hoti he
 But in Pakistan, these global terrorists do what they want, but Pakistan remains a haven for terrorists
 daaud se lekar hafiz said or masood azhar tak yahaan jab chahen jahaan chahen ghoomte hai
 The fourth proposal was brought on 27 February Following the Pulwama attack, on 27 February, the US, Britain and France had brought proposals against Azhar in support of India
 10 se zyada deshon ne prastaav kaa samarthan kiya tha
 It was decided that if a member of the Security Council did not object to this, then Jaish leader Masood Azhar would be declared an international terrorist
 prastaav kii samay seemaa 13 march raat 12:30 baje khatm ho rahi thi
 At that time it felt that this time Masood will be punished for his misdeeds, but just one hour before the deadline of the proposal, China imposed it
 haalanki is prastaav par adnge ke baad suraksha parishad ke sadasyon ne china ko saaf chetavanee di ki agar wo masood ajahar ko lekar apane rukh ko nahin badalegaa to karrwai ke duusare vikalp bhi khule hai
 In such a situation, there was pressure on not only India but also other countries
 10 saal se chaal chal rahaa chinabeete 10 saal main masood ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit karne kii 4 baar koshish hui
 The first proposal was made by the Manmohan government in 2009 at the United Nations
 2016 main bharat ne america, britain or france ke saath milakar prastaav rakhaa
 In 2017, India proposed the third time together with these countries
 iske baad 2019 main france kii aguwai main phir se pratibandh parishad main prastaav rakhaa gaya
 Every time China used the veto to save Masood Azhar
 chauthi baar manaa karne par china par antarrashtriya dabaav badhane laga
 The remaining four members of the UN Security Council started getting angry with him
 china ke vito ko france, america or britain ne apni tauheen ke taur par liya
 In other countries of the world, there was a perception about China that it is a terrorist support country
 isse wo dabaav main aane laga
 China had sought to put a 'technical hold'
 At the meeting of the UN Security Council in March, although China did not use veto power to topple the proposal, it sought time to consider putting the proposal on 'technical hold'
 Was
 magar ek maheene baad is masale par dobaaraa hui baithak main china ko jhukna padaa or wo jaish ke sargana masood ajahar ko antarrashtriya aatanki ghoshit kiye jane par raji ho gaya
 After this, China removed Masood's head from there, Masood Azhar was declared an international terrorist
 paak main gum rahe hai do antarrashtriya aatankipakistan se masood ajahar akelaa global terrarist nahin balki uske alaava daud ibrahim or hafiz said bhi global tebrist hai
 In 2003, Dawood was declared a Global Terrorist by India and the US, while in 2012, the US also announced a $ 10 billion reward on Global Terrorist Hafiz Saeed
 phir bhi hafiz said or daud ibrahim bade aaraam se jindagi guzaar rahe hai
 Dawood Ibrahim is handling his real estate business and there are reports of him going abroad several times
 vahiin hafiz said kaa sanghathan apane puraane andaaj main aatankiyon ko training de rahaa he
 Not only this, in the last general elections, Hafiz fought his terrorists till the elections and now he is dreaming of becoming Pakistan's PM

 sincerely) a post shared by Manasi Parekh (@manasi_parekh) on Mar 21, 2018 at 7:58am PDT At the same time when the Prime Minister was addressing army officers in very plain veneer in Bengaluru, the auction of that suit started in his home state Surat, which these days there was a lot of political controversy
 loksabhaa chunaavon main ummidavaar se lekar shapath grahan tak pradhanmantri kaa har pahanava fishan or style statement ke lihaaz dekha gaya
 People also adopted under his influence
 kaaryakarta bhi apane pradhanmantri kii tarah ban-than kar chalane lage
 Wearing well and good is also associated with political practice
 pradesh bijepi daftar ke baahar modi ke rangeen jacketon kii nakal bechney vaale us muslim dukandaar kii yaad aa gai, jinhone kaha tha ki tivi main modi jis rang ke jacket pahane dikhte hai, uske agle hi din kaaryakarta maang karne lagate hai ki hamen usee rang kii sadri chahie
 But apart from politics, no attempt was made to imitate the suit disputed in international and national media due to specific reasons
 haalanki kameez kii baanh par bhi signechar kaa hona fishan main kab se he
 There is also the practice of getting your name and one's name tattooed from hand to ear, but every stripe of the suit should be made of its own name, people did not like it, it needs to be understood
 kya isaki vajah suut kii vivaadit keemat thi, jisase yah sawaal uthaa ki itnaa mahangaa suut pahan kar pradhanmantri kya sandesh dena chaahate hai
 Did people see Narendra Modi in this suit that he did not know
 kya is suut ne pradhanmantri ko us janata ke bich anjaanaa bana diya, jinke dilon par wo raaj karte the
 Actually, apart from the disputed price of the suit, the stripe made in his name also caused a lot of damage
 pradhanmantri ko un pahaluon se jod diya, jisaki charchaa to hoti thi, magar ek had se zyada koi dhyaan nahin detaa tha
 Many people saw Modi, the enlightened individualist in that suit
 kuch ne misr ke taanashaah hosni mubarak ke suut se tulana kar di
 Hosni Mubarak also wore a suit equipped with a stripe of his own name
 modi ke fishan dizineron ne is ek suut se apane netaa ko un logon se kuch samay ke liye bahut dur kar diya, jo unhen dil se chaahati rahi he
 During the election coverage of Delhi, common people were also heard talking about that suit
 jin logon ne pradhanmantri ko har rang main sweekaar kiya unhen yah nile rang kaa suut jamaa nahin
 But now that suit is being auctioned in Surat
 is suut ke saath pradhanmantri ke taur par mili uphaaron kii bhi nilaamee hogi
 The list which has been shared with the media, has 237 clothes, but in the media it has come into the limelight due to the auction suit
 nilaamee main kapadon ke alaava anya kai samagriyaan hai, jo agle teen dinon tak nilaam hongi
 It has been told that the money that will come from this will be invested in cleaning the Ganges
 to kya ab pradhanmantri is suut se lage daag se mukt ho jaaenge
 Will the dispute end now? pradhanmantri kaa bachaav karne vaale kahenge ki ganga ke liye itnaa mahangaa suut pahana to virdohi nilaamee kii keemat jodakar bataaenge ki dekhiye suut kitna mahangaa he
 This dispute will go on
 log shaayad yakeen bhi na karen ki yah suut ganga ke liye pahana gaya magar sabak seekhney main tatparta ke maamle main pradhanmantri kii daad deni hogi
 He did not spend a week getting rid of this suit
 dilli chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad unke kapadon ke rang kaa tone us tarah se tej nahin he, jiske liye ve jane jate hai
 Who can understand better than the Prime Minister who specializes in dialogue and communication
 haal ke dinon ke pahanaave se ve bataa rahe hai ki unhone sabak sikh liya he
 In the last phase of the Manmohan Singh government, when there was an atmosphere of despair everywhere, Modi was able to convey with his colorful and stalwart kurtas that he is ready to take up the challenge
 ve aashaa kaa sanchaar kar sakate hai
 People saw those colors by associating them with the natural qualities of strong leadership and the same process continued even after the formation of the government
 lekin kya in rangon ke pradarshan ko lekar kuch zyada ho gaya tha jisase logon ne chamakdaar pradhanmantri ke netritv ke saamne dilli main ek aise vyakti ko apana netaa chun liya, jiske fishan kii nakal kar log apane bachche ke janmdin main bhi na jaaen
 Arvind Kejriwal has told that this is the common man's dress
 bhale fishan na ho magar wo itnaa hi kharid saktaa he or aisa hi pahananaa pasand karata he, jinke gharon main bijli nahin aati or heater nahin chalata he, vahaan log arvind kii tarah hi mafalar se kaanon ko kas dete hai taaki garam rahe
 No matter how much fun a monkey cap makes, the wearer wears it
 aap kolkata se lekar bihar ke gaanvon main jaakar dekh lijie
 There is also a fashion statement in the Delhi election results
 janata hameshaa behtareen naap or dizine vaale kapadon main hi netaa ko nahin parakhti he
 In front of a very simple-looking sweater, muffler and trousers, he overcame the designer but allegedly the suit of millions
 nilaamee main yah suut ho saktaa he karodon main bik jaae yaa yah bhi ho saktaa he ki isaki bahut kam boli lage magar jo bhi yah suut legaa wo garv se namo ke is suut ko nahin dikhaa paaegaa, kyonki is suut main koi fishan statement nahin bachaa he
 Namo did not embrace this suit even by making it his own, but has shrugged it off in a wise manner
 yah ek aisa kapadaa he jise pradhanmantri bhi apni acchhee yaadon kaa hissaa nahin banaayenge
 The buyer may also bury this suit quietly in the corner of a box in their home

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who played a key role in giving India a thrilling win over Sri Lanka in the tri-series final, once again proved himself to be the best finisher in the history of ODI cricket
 purv bhartiya captain or mukhya chayankarta dilip vengsarakar ne sweekaar kiya ki unhone jharkhand ke is cricketer se behatar finishr nahin dekha he
 Vengsarkar said, after losing the opening match, the young Indian brigade made a challenging comeback
 dhoni kaa mizaaj bahut badhiya he, ab tak maine jo finishr dekhe hai, unamem vah sarvshereshth he
 He does not panic in any situation in the game
 vah toornament main bharat kii jeet kaa zikr kar rahe the, jisamen srilanka or mejabaan west indies se shuruaati do round robin match ganvaane ke baavjood team ne final main jagah banaai
 Dhoni played the match-winning unbeaten innings to give the team a one-wicket win in the tri-series final at Queens Park Oval
 tii-20 praaroop ko duniya main kaaphi lokapriyata mil rahi he, jisase khilaadiyon ko pehle se kahin zyada nayaapan laane main madad mil rahi he, lekin dhoni ne iske lokapriy hone se pehle hi jeet kaa yah jajba dikhaa diya tha
 Captain Cool had shown how well he qualified in the death overs during the chase of the target in 50-over matches, before showing great finishing skills in the Twenty20 format
 varsh 2005 main dhoni bhartiya team main nae-nae the or unhone tisare number par ballebaaji karte hue mahaj 145 gend main naabad 183 ran kaa score banaaya tha, jo ab tak unka sarvshereshth score he, jisamen 10 chakke or 15 chauke shaamil the
 With this innings, India achieved the target of 299 runs given by Sri Lanka with four overs, while their team included their best bowlers Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralitharan
 isse kuch maheene pehle hi dhoni ne vishakhapatnam main pakistan ke khilaaf 123 gend main 148 ran kii pari khelkar apni shandaar kaabiliyat kaa najaara pesh kiya tha, jisase bharat ne nau wicket par 356 ran kaa score khadaa kiya or mehmaan team haar gai thi
 Dhoni played the role of a finisher in Pakistan in Lahore and Karachi in 2006, including an unbeaten 70-plus innings, which helped India go 4–1 in the ODI series after a 0–1 defeat in the Test series
 Won
 unhone banguldesh main may main 2007 or phir janvari 2010 main kramash: naabad 91 or naabad 101 ran kii pari khelkar yah kaam phir se kiya
 In these few innings, Dhoni joined Yuvraj Singh and Virat Kohli and other players and on Thursday he did the same with the last player Ishant Sharma

 He has scored 7,300 runs in 226 odis with eight centuries, 48 fifties, but the great finisher's ability is revealed only by the fact that he is unbeaten once in every four innings
 saathi khilaadi rohit sharma ne sheersh kram main 58 ran kii jimmedaarana pari kheli, unhone dhoni ke bare main kaha, dhoni ne hamaare liye baar-baar aisa kiya he, isliye ham sabhi dressing room main sakaaratmak the
 We have seen them doing this for many years

 Former Indian captain and chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar admitted that he has not seen a better finisher than this Jharkhand cricketer
 vengsarakar ne kaha, shuruaati match ganvaane ke baad yuva bhartiya brigade ne chunauteepurn vaapasi kii
 Dhoni's mood is very good, he is the best finisher i have seen so far
 vah khel main kisi bhi sthiti main ghabaraata nahin he
 He was referring to India's victory in the tournament, despite losing the opening two round-robin matches to Sri Lanka and the host West Indies, the team made it to the finals
 dhoni ne match vijeta naabad pari khelkar team ko queens park ovel main trikoniya siries ke final main mushkil sthiti se ubaarte hue ek wicket se jeet dilaai
 The T20 format is gaining a lot of popularity in the world, helping the players to innovate more than ever before, but Dhoni had shown this sense of victory even before it became popular
 twanti-20 praaroop main shandaar phinishing kaushal dikhaane se pehle captain kool ne dikhaa diya tha ki vah 50 over ke maichon main lakshya kaa peechha karne ke dauraan deth over main kitne yogya hai
 In the year 2005, Dhoni was new to the Indian team and batting at number three, scored an unbeaten 183 off just 145 balls, which is his best score so far, which included 10 sixes and 15 fours
 is pari se bharat ne srilanka dwaara die gaye 299 ran ke lakshya ko chaar over rahete hi hasil kar liya tha, jabaki unki team main unke sarvshereshth gendbaaj chaminda vaas or muthaiya muralidharan shaamil the
 a few months earlier, Dhoni showed his brilliant ability by playing a 123-ball 148 against Pakistan in Visakhapatnam, which led India to a 356 for nine and the visiting team lost
 dhoni ne pakistan main 2006 main lahore or karachi main joardaar andaaj main phinishir kii bhoomika adaa kii, jisamen naabad 70 se adhik ran kii pari shaamil thi, jisase bharat ne test siries main 0-1 kii haar ke baad vanade siries main 4-1 se jeet darj kii
 He did it again in Bangladesh, playing innings of 91 not out and 101 not out in May 2007 and again in January 2010 respectively

 One day the victim was alone at home

 The accused also threatened to defame him by telling anyone about this
 blackmel kar uskaa yon shoshan karata rahaa
 Meanwhile, the victim became pregnant for 4 months

 fifa world cap theme dinar main apane chaatro ke france, brazil, germany, italy or spain ke vividh vyanjanon kaa swaad lene ke liye apane daravaaje aam janata ke liye khol die the
 It organized the Food and Drink Workshop in collaboration with the Alliance Francis de Bouqube for students and experts in hospitality, revenue, human resources and tourism and leveraged the experiences of those experts
 institute ke principal arun kumaar singh kehete hai, “chaatro ko yah jaanane kii jarurat he ki industry kii apekshaayen kya hai
 "these kinds of activities, which give students the opportunity to meet the eminent professionals in the industry and prepare them to face real-world challenges outside their classroom, give IHM Mumbai a distinct identity and that is why It is today that in the survey of India Today group-nielsen, this institute stands on the highest position in the list of best colleges for hotel management
 
 iskaa basic course, hospitality and hotel administration main biessi lagaataar sabase lokapriy course bana hua he
 More than 400 students are admitted to this course every year
 teen varshon ke dauraan iske vyapak paathyakram main front offis, food and biverej sarvice, housakiping and food production jaise mukhya vishyon ko shaamil kiya gaya he
 Food production includes cookery and bakery
 in sab vishyon ke saath-saath duusare mahatvapurn vishyon jaise nutrishan, food science, communication, maanav sansaadhan or financial management ko bhi padhaayaa jaataa he
 In this way, students are given such education that takes into account all aspects
 restaraan kii yojana banane or bistar taiyaar karne se lekar cocktail taiyaar karne or vyanjan parosane tak sab kuch isamen shaamil he
 Arun Singh explains that the institute provides students with all types of training related to hotels
 ve kehete hai, “pehle saal main hamaare paathyakram main skill par vishesh jor diya jaataa he or teesraa saal aate-aate management se judaa paksh bad jaataa he
 With three kitchens, three bakeries, two training restaurants, an applied training center and a hostel with 150 boys and 80 girls, the institute is also ranked first in terms of student care and facilities
 hospitality or paryaton industry bahut bad chuki he
 The number of institutes offering hotel management has increased, but IHM Mumbai has been successful in maintaining its reputation
 yah is vajah se sambhav ho sakaa he ki yahaan se padhakar nikle purv chaatro ne pichley chah dashakon ke safar main ek majboot jagah banaai he
 Regarding the controversial statement made by Salman Khan regarding the shooting of the film 'sultan', whether the BJP leader and the Women's Commission are being asked to ask for their statement, but now Salman's loved ones also come to the rescue of Salman Huh
 salmaan ne haal hi main'sultan'kii shooting ko lekar yah bayaan diya tha ki 'sultan' kii shooting kii thakaan kisi rape victim jaisi thi
 As soon as Salman's controversial statement hit the headlines, the fans of Bhaijaan also took to Twitter to show their favor
 twitor par # salmanmisquoted naam kaa hashtag trend kar rahaa he
 Salman's fans have made several tweets in favor of him
 is vivaad parasalmanka bachaav karte hue unke phans kaa kahana he ki salmaan khan ke bayaan ko media ne galat tareeke se pesh kiya he or sirf aadhe adhure bayaan ko dikhaakar unki chhavi ko kharaab karne kii koshish kii he
 Once again # salmanmisquoted😠 Media doesn't let go to encash using @ beingsalmankhan! Why emphasize half sentences & that too negatively 😡— Anita Ahluwalia (@anitaahluwalia) June 21, 2016 a fan of Salman Khan said, just listen to that audio recording, he is telling about what he said, if he is wrong Then why the media people laughed at that time? Said this controversy was beneficial for Salman's upcoming film Sultan, he tweeted, Media Helping them to target and make them stronger
 ab sultan 50-60 or zyada bijness karegi, acha he
 
 
 
 Media is really helping him n making him strong by targeting him
 
 Now Sultan will do 50-60cr more business
 
 Accha hai
 # salmanmisquoted — Sad Boy (@beingsk_soul) June 21, 2016SALMAN and controversies goes hand in hand still his stardom is unaffected, his fans never moved, that's his personality
 # salmanmisquoted— Abdul Kareem (@beingkareemkhan)june 21, 2016immediately Aftr Commenting That Salman paused and Regreted "i don't think i should have
 
 "and continued Further interview # salmanmisquoted— Jαι Sυlтαи❤ (@beingsalmaniac1)june 21, 2016 i do not want Jaitley to resign
 main isliye ye chahta hum ki mujhe chance hi nahin mila unka bachaav karne ke liye
 When many journalists were seen defending Jaitley, for the first time that day, it felt like they were behind in life
 magar phir laga ki jab jetali ko bhi in patrakaron ke bachaav kii zarurat pad jaae tab laga ki mujhase zyaada to jetali ji peeche rah gaye
 These journalists have come to the rescue and have reduced the dignity of Jaitley's ruling world
 reporter beuro cheef kaa bachaav nahin karata he
 The job of the bureau chief is to protect the reporter
 sivam vij ne twit main yah tanj kyon kiya ki jetali ko yun hi nahin beuro cheef kaha jaataa he
 Since then i am more sad
 main jetali ji kaa bahut aadar karata hum
 But do not protect yourself from these champs
 lijie aapaki khaatir main likh detaa hum ki aap istipha na den
 I'm with you sivam vij ko shaayad pataa na ho ki media kaa managing editor to kab se badal gaya he
 The dock media system has only one managing editor
 or ab yah system pachaas saal rahane vaala he
 There is no work of political editor or bureau chief in this system
 naqvi or singhvi kii bite eenai se aa jaati he
 Which is now called 'byte Done'
 vahi haal ankaron kaa bhi he jo aap jaanate he
 Dear Janata, how long will you watch this spectacle? kya tab tak dekhenge jab sara satyanaash ho jayega? mogul e aazam kaa gaanaa suniye
 Well yes we will also see
 ek patrkaar ko kehete suna ki usne dekha tha ki jetali or maalya kii mulaaqaat 30 second kii hui
 One said it took 40 seconds
 do saal pehle yani 1 march 2016 kii mulaakaat kaa itnaa sahi vivaran yaad he
 Our journalists must have had a stop watch at that time
 jaise hi maalya jetali ke kareeb gaye honge unhone second ginana shuru kar diya hoga
 Tick xxwrep 195 tick ticks thik se gin lijie
 We have written a total of forty ticks
 bas itane hi der kii mulaaqaat hui
 Stop Watch journalists did not write
 raksha mantralay par likhane vaale vitt mantri jetali ji ne blog nahin likhaa
 If you think that writing this stuff will change the system of Lutyens' Delhi then you are in misconception
 in patrakaron ne abhi kyon kaha
 Then why did not say
 jaise mujhase kehete hai dilli to thik he, bengal par nahin bolaa
 Didn't think that Gabbar would be very happy then? inaam degaa
 Mallya will forget
 ab patrkaar hi is laayak hai to jetali kaa kya dosha
 By the way, i have a complete list of when i did not speak
 aap wo list jari kar mujhe chup kara sakate hai
 Like those people were silent for two years after thirty seconds of meeting
 maalya ke bharat parityag prakaran ke do chor hai
 One end is who made Mallya Mallya and the other end is Mallya in whose kingdom and with whose help he ran
 donon hi chor ko lekar do alag alag press conference ho rahe hai
 Is equal to sach yah he ki maalya ne har dal kii madad se khud ko rajyasabha main pahunchaakar bharat kii sansadeey parampara ko upakrit kiya
 Gave main maalya ke is yogadan kaa sammaan karata hum
 i am pro-mallya in this matter
 kya maalya bahut bade raajnneetik vichaarak the? jin jin logon ne unhen sansad main pahunchaaya wo saamne aakar bole ton
 In One Sentence! vijay maalya, lalit modi, neerav modi, hamaare mehul bhai, jatin mehta in sabane bharat kaa parityag kiya he
 Whose name was used in the Lalit Modi case, it has disappeared from public memory
