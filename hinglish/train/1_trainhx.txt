 RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat did not talk politically through 'rashtrodaya: Swayamsevak Samagam' first in Banaras, then Agra and the next day in Meerut, but without saying anything, it is not possible to implement politics without it
 isiilie jaateey or vaicharik matbhinnataaon main gaiyr rajnatik manch se samanta kaa sandesh dekar sangh 'hindutv or kattarta' kii nai paribhaasha lekar utraa he, jisamen hindutv kaa matlab puraa desh or kattarta kaa arth udaartaa he
 But is the Sangh's agenda with political implications really attracting those castes and ideologies that consider the BJP to be anti-bjp or themselves 'saffron victims' in the political arena? It is important to know why this question arises and Why did RSS need social engineering? In fact, in the 2014 general election, the Hindu votes that were polarized towards the BJP included a decisive number of other backward classes and Dalits
 2017 ke uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main yah sameekaran barkaraar to rahaa lekin 2014 ke anupaat main ghat gaya
 In addition to the events in the bjp-ruled states, the statement of Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat ending reservations before the Bihar elections is also seen
 uttar pradesh main bhaajapa sarkaar banane ke baad saharanpur jile ke shabbirpur gaanv main daliton or rajputon ke bich hui jaateey hinsa kii ghatnaon ke baad sangh kii soshal ejineering main teji ai he
 Activism and vigilance are clearly visible in this state, because the way to reach the central power is not possible without Uttar Pradesh
 2014 main bhaajapa or sahyogiyon ko 73 loksabhaa siten upi se hi mili thim or isamen pashchimi uttar pradesh kaa mahatvapurn yogadan tha
 Then the Muzaffarnagar riots had also unilaterally polarized in favor of the BJP and today they have also changed the situation
 jaahir he, sangh ko soshal ejineering kaa formula bhi thodaa badalanaa padaa he
 Earlier it had pure Hindutva, but now there are castes in Hindutva as well
 meerut ke 'rashtrodayah swayamsevak samagam' ke duusare din, 25 farvari ko sangh pramukh bhagwat ne do lakh se adhik swayamsevakon ko apane sambodhan main sandesh diya, ''vyakti main udaartaa or ahimsa ke liye kattarta honi chahie
 Values like sacrifice and restraint do not belong to any one worship or sect
 kattar hindutv kaa matlab kattar ahimsa or kattar udaartaa se he
 We have forgotten ourselves and fight among the castes
 hamaare jhagadon kii aag par sari duniya rotiyaan senkati he
 "bhagwat has already said," Every person living in India is a Hindu
 '' vivaadit ho chuki is tippanee ko is baar unhone kuch is salike se pesh kiya, ''jo vyakti bhartiya purvajon kaa vanshaj he, vah hindu he
 Therefore we should embrace every person of the society
 ''darasal bhagwat ke meerut sambodhan ke sandesh ko 23 farvari ko agra main unke 'samarasata sangam' manch ke baraabar main ek bada hording spasht kar rahaa tha
 In the midst of the hoarding, Lord Rama, eating the plum from the hands of Shabari, and the images of Sant Ravidas, Sant Kabirdas, Maharishi Valmiki and Gautama Buddha around it and all the saints and Mahatmas of the society sitting on the second platform a short distance away
 yani varanasi se lekar tajanagari agra or meerut tak sandesh saaf he ki sangh 2019 se pehle jatiyon ko jodne nikal padaa he
 Such conferences of the Sangh have taken place before but never before with saffron
 agra main sant mahatmaon ke manch ke neeche lage nile binar par likhaa tha, ''samras jivan se tuutegi bhedbhaav kii dhara, isse hi ekatm hua he sara raashtra hamaara
 '' The venue of the conference in Meerut was illuminated with blue light at night
 jaahir he, haal hi main sampann nagar nigam chunaav main meerut haar chuki bhaajapa ke liye sangh kaa yahaan padaav mahatvapurn tha, lekin neeli roshni daliton ko aakarshith karne ke liye paryaapt sabit nahin hui or daliton kaa koi bada cheharaa bhi isamen najar nahin aayaa
 However, everyday claims were made that the Dalit and Thakur violence victims of Shabbirpur in the Samagam would give a message of unity
 lekin shabbirpur or meerut ke bich kii duuri yathaavat barkaraar rahi
 Ramkumar, secretary of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, Uttar Pradesh, explains a big reason behind this, "every time the Sangh comes forward, it talks about embracing, adding caste but there is no initiative to break caste
 upi main bhaajapa shashan ke das maheenon main dalit utpeedan kii ghatnaayen kareeb 20 fisadi badi hi hai
 The Sangh never directs accountability to the BJP
 '' haalanki meerut main sangh ke samagam kaa daliton ke virodh kaa bhi ek bada kaaran he
 The hoardings placed before the Samagam were overthrown by the Dalits across Meerut, saying that the Dalit greats were described as 'untouchables'
 shaayad yahi vajah rahi ki sangh kaa samagam daliton ko apeksha ke anuroop aakarshith nahin kar paaya or sangh ko soshal ejineering kaa sandesh duusare raste se dena padaa
 This was the way of arranging food for the volunteers who were brought from the villages with the influence of Dalits
 doosraa rasta tha gaanv, mahilaon or yuvaaon kii adhiktam bhagidaari kaa or isamen sangh khaas taur par pashchimi upi main kisi had tak safal najar aata he
 "when the BJP came to power at the Center in 2014, there were around 2,400 Sangh branches in Meerut alone," says Ajay Mittal, the state's campaign head of the Sangh
 ab yah sankhya 4,500 ho gai he
 More than two lakh new members have joined Western UP
 '' inamen dalit kitne the? ise ginaney kaa koi satyapit formula nahin he lekin itnaa jarur he ki sangh kii praathamikta main dalit hai
 But the founder member of BSP and now Raghubir Singh Buddhist, who is associated with Buddhist Mahasabha, disagrees
 ve kehete hai, ''hamen keval siyaasi jarurat ke liye bhaichaare kaa ehsaas karaayaa jaataa he
 "but it is not that there is only opposition among the Dalits towards the Sangh and that is why the Sangh does not seem to deviate from its goal
" dalit bahul aitihaasik kshetra hastinapur se samagam main aae siddharth biltoria kehete hai, ''hamen un avasaron kii andekhi nahin kerani chahie jahaan hamen samanta ke adhikaar kaa ehsaas hota he
 They may be different on social and political occasions
 '' saaf he ki sangh yaa raajnneeti ke liye hi dalit ek avasar nahin hai, balki unke liye bhi aise aayojan avasar hai
 Now the castes that the Sangh is engaged in trying to practice, they are also suffering from negativity and influence arising out of bigotry
 aise main is soshal ejineering par sangh or bhaajapa ko alag karke nahin dekha ja saktaa kyonki sangh sampurna hindutv kii jis takat kii baat kar rahaa he, uskaa bada phayda bhaajapa ko hi hona he or iskaa sara daaromadar is par nirbhar he ki 2019 tak jaateey judaav kitna ho paaegaa

 ye he kisaan sanghathanon kii daleel1

 He believes that the government talks about MSP but does not guarantee that the produce of the farmer will be purchased in any case
 majdoor sanghathan maang kar rahe hai ki sarkaar upaj naa kharidne vaale agenton par nakel kase or un par jurmaana ho
 Farmers 'income has fallen in 4 years, which will be the last year, the announcement made for agriculture sector in this year can be breathtaking because all these announcements have been made in front of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, but in reality farmers' income Growing can be a great casserole

 kahin aap bhi to un logon main se nahin jo khichdi ke naam par hi naak-munh sicodne lagate hai? zyaadaatar log khichdi ko bimaaron kaa khaanaa maanate hai lekin kya aap jaanate hai khichdi ek aisi cheez jise khaane ke sirf or sirf phaayde hi hai

 Eating yogurt in khichdi doubles its taste
 khichdi khaane ke teen behtareen phaayde:1
 Your mother or your grandmother, full of nutrients, must have told you the benefits of khichdi
 khichdi carbohydrate, vitamin, calcium, fibers, magnesium, potacium or phosphorus ke gunon se bharpoor hoti he
 If you wish, you can increase its nutritional properties further by mixing different types of vegetables in it
 2
 Easy to digest, spices do not use strong spices nor does it contain too much oil, ghee
 aise main ye aasaani se pach jaati he or yahi kaaran he ki beemaari main log khichdi khaane kii salaah dete hai
 If your digestive system is weak then khichdi is most beneficial for you
 3
 Helps to keep the body safe from diseases, regular intake of khichdi ends the defect of vata, bile and phlegm
 khichdi sharir ko urja to dene kaa kaam karti hi he, saath hi ye rog pratiraksha tantra ko bhi boost karne kaa kaam karti he

 '' gudgaanv jab gurugram hua tab kisi ne yah to nahin kaha tha ki trephic jam nahin lagegaa
 Now when people are stuck in jam for five to six hours, then people have understood the futility of changing the name
 jhunjhalaahat or khiz main ai is jaagrukta main bhi kuch buniyadi samasyaayein hai
 Jam is neither related to old name nor new name
 guuruuvaar kii raat jab log baarah baarah ghante ke jam main fanse to unka dhiraj jawaab de gaya
 Well now we have become comfortable about spending one and a half to two hours in jam everyday
 gussa isliye aayaa ki chaar ghante kyon lage, paanch ghante kyon lage
 The photos are really intimidating
 chaar se aath ghante tak jam main fanse rahane se sharir kaa blader or gaadi kaa radiator jawaab dene laga hoga
 The days are not far when emergency bio toilets will start being built in cars
 gudgaanv ke is jam ne logon ko rulaa diya he
 One of the two major dreams of middle-class life, people left the car on the road and walked towards their second dream, which we call a flat
 kai kaaron ne samay se pehle praan tyaag diye yani ingine seez ho gaya
 How much will be spent on repairing them, offices will be discharged for this or not, Ram knows
 ambulance bhi funs gaya lekin jaagruk nagarikon kii toli ne apni chintaa chhod kisi tarah ambulance ko bhi nikaala
 In the last twenty years, only two dreams have been sold to us
 car or makaan kaa sapana
 You are seeing the misfortune of both
 jis shahar main saikadon iti companiyaan hon or aae din in companiyon se bharat kii kisi na kisi samasya ke samaadhaan ke ap beche ja rahe hon, inamen se ek bhi aisa ap nahin bana sakaa he jo aise jam se hamen mukti dilaa sake
 Rather, people started to call Gurugram as IT city
 unka sabar tuutane laga
 They started thundering to be called Millennium City
 phir bhartiya samskruti kaa naitik boj utaar kar gurugram kehane ko hi gariyaane lage
 People are not even aware that Guru Drona is being mocked for making fun of Gurugram
 farzi rashtrawaad se news channelon ko fursat nahin thi varna wo isi baat par jam main fanse logon ko deshadrohi se lekar apradhi tak qaraar dete
 The people of Gurugram survived
 twitor par jab jam kii tasviren viral hone lageen to kaaron kii roshni darasal us andhere kii tarah nazar aane lagi jisase paar paane kaa rasta kisi ko nahin sujh rahaa tha
 People felt that by tweeting, the urban system will improve
 sarkaar image bachaane ke liye kuch karegi
 The superficial measures and assurances of the government, just as the superficial anger of the people
 soochna ai ki do adhikari bheje ja rahe hai
 o Janta Janardan, understand a little that two officials will not be able to go and diagnose the problem created in Gurgaon for decades
 ab ham us twitor jagat kii pratikriyaaon kii baat karte hai jiske 5000 saal pehle hi avishkaar ho jane ko lekar abhi tak kisi ne daawa nahin kiya he
 The name of Twitter in Gurugram is still tweeter
 solah ghante ke jam main fanse logon kii maansik yaatnaaon ko samajhnaa bahut mushkil he
 @gauravpandhi Tweet1 gudgaanv se gurugram! sirf naam nahin sarkaar hamen guru dronacharya ke yug main le janaa chaahati he, 5000 saal pehle
 Take the bullock cart

 @raydeep Tweet6 gurugram ko milinium city kaha jaataa he, lekin aisa lagata he ki ye agali sadi main city ban paaegaa
 Gurugram or Gudgobar
 @mpalso Tweet7 Schools have declared a holiday because of traffic problems
 milinium city gudgaanv main aapkaa swaagat he
 About 35% of Haryana's income comes from Gurgaon
 gudgaanv ke kai naam hai
 The name Gurugram has been announced but the notification has not been issued
 sarkaar ne notification tak jari nahin kiya magar media ne gurugram likhnaa shuru kar diya
 On 21 May 2016, Hindustan Times published a statement by District Magistrate TL Satyaprakash that no notification has been issued to Gurgaon to Gurugram
 shuukravaar ko ziladhikari ne jo aadesh jari kiye hai usamen bhi gurugram nahin likhaa he, balki gudgaanv likhaa he
 Whereas Gurugram was announced on 12 April
 jab naam badalane main itnaa time lag jaataa he to samajhiye naala banane or trephic lite lagane main saal do saal to lagegaa na
 Before Gurugram, people called Gurgaon as the Singapore of India with love, called IT City, called Millennium City
 ab vahaan ke nivasee inhen naamon kaa makhul bhi uda rahe hai
 Even the Gurugram named after Guru Drona was made fun of, in view of the chance of opportunity, the group of those who were hurt on such things started to ignore
 acha hi he
 Anyway people are angry with the condition of the modern city
 puranic kaal main trephic jam thode na hota hoga
 However, there was so much fear from the jam that the administration closed the schools
 or wo dhara 144 laga di jo har dhara ke vakt laga di jaati he
 Whether you flow with the stream or against the stream, without section 144 you cannot flow anywhere
 baadh, sukhadh, tufaan, dharna pradarshan sabamein dhara 144 hi kaam aati he
 The administration has both natural and democratic disasters
 isiilie dhara 144 janatantric ubhaar ko rokane main lagati he vahi prakritik tufaan ke vakt bhi lagati he
 i am not talking about Dhara brand mustard oil
 gudgaanv ke ziladhikari tii el satyaprakash ne kaha he ki gudgaanv main apratyaashit barish hui he
 a lot of water is coming from Delhi to Gurgaon
 car ke ingine fail ho gaye hai, 12 ghante se zyada samay se kai jagahon par jam laga he, agle 15 din main baari barish kii ashanka ko dekhte hue main dhara 144 lagane ke aadesh de rahaa hum
 All agencies are ordered to rent equipment at the right rates and to get rid of the traffic jam
 sabhi thekedaaron ko civik agency ke saath sahyog karnaa hoga
 The administration has become cautious
 ziladhikari ne aadesh diya he ki sitambar ke ant ke liye nigam ayukta wo paryaapt sankhya main homeguard kii tainaati karen
 They should be made traffic management
 in par jo kharchaa aayega use sheetala mata mandir board ke siio bhugtan karenge
 Are we reacting correctly to the problem of Gurgaon
 agar vahaan karodon ke flats hai to gudgaanv ke nigam ko tex bhi milte honge
 Gurgaon Citizen Council is an apex body of around 100 Resident Welfare Association of New Gurugram
 he
 We have taken some information from its chairman RS Rathi
 yahaan par buniyadi dhaancha banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The Haryana Development Authority is called HUDA
 master road, master civej, master drenaj, water supplai banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The structure within the housing society, from road to sewage, came to the builder
 ek tarah se sarkaar ke jimme bahari sadak yaa naale vagraih banane ke hi kaam aae
 Rathi Saheb said that Rs 17,000 crore has been given to HUDA in the name of external development by the Resident Welfare Association
 gudgaanv citigen council ne supreme court main ise lekar cese bhi kiya he ki hamaare upar jo tex lage hai wo kahaan kahaan kharch ho rahe hai ye bataaiye
 In 2013, HUDA gave a written affidavit in the Supreme Court that HUDA spent only 5500 crores out of 17000 crores including metro
 huda kaa koi bajet nahin hota he
 The department spends where it deems appropriate
 rathi ji ne bataaya ki gudgaanv main 2008 main nagar nigam kii sthapana hui lekin nagar nigam ko 2013 tak koi adhikaar nahin diya gaya
 The money that comes from house tax stays with the Municipal Corporation and the state government does not give the money that comes from stamp duty to the corporation
 kaash ki hamaare paas sarkaar kaa bhi paksh hota lekin rathi ji ke anusaar iskaa nateeja yah hota he ki nagar nigam ke paas vikaas ke liye paise nahin hote hai
 There is no regular staff
 gurugram main 35 ward hai
 There are about 25–30 cleaning workers or corporation employees per ward
 shahar kii zarurat ke hisaab se yah sankhya paryaapt nahin he
 The proposed budget of the corporation is 1600 crores but they get 400 crores
 jab tak ham in sawaalon main dilchaspee nahin lenge gurugram kaa bhala dhara 144 se nahin hoga
 Rathi Ji said that Badshah Pur Nala passes along Sohna Road
 is naale ke zariye hi gurugram kaa pani hero honda chowk se hote hue nazangarh dren main jaataa tha
 a highway was built over this drain and its natural flow was stopped
 nateeja yah hua ki badshaah poor naale kaa pani upar aane laga or waapas usee shahar ko bhar diya
 As a result, Jaipur Highway was blocked first
 chah chah foot pani bhar gaya
 Many vehicles were drowned
 uske baad mahrauli road block ho gaya
 As many sector roads are there, all those blocks of Gurugram went away
 gaadiyaan funsane lageen
 The condition was that the Border Security Force was called at night, yet the road could not open
 rathi sahab ne kaha ki logon kaa gussa vakti he
 You will forget as soon as the road opens
 unhone kaha ki ve pandrah saal se in muddon ko lekar lard rahe hai magar log nahin aate hai
 This anger of the people through rhyme regarding the name tells us how far we have become from the basic questions
 trephic jam ko ham na jane kitne saal se bhugat rahe hai
 People from Delhi Mumbai, Bangalore
 bangaleru vaale to ab barsaat ke pani main machhlee bhi pakadaney lage hai
 The snake also came out
 agar ham jeev jantuon kii zamin ko isi tarah kabja kar smart city basaate rahe to wo ek din nikal kar hamaare paanvon main lipatane aaenge
 The media of TV keeps on telling you stories of fake nationalism every day, but returns to such questions only when you get stuck in a jam
 hamaare shaharon main aise haadase lagaataar hote ja rahe hai
 We are constantly forgetting
 26 july 2005 yani aaj se 11 saal pehle mumbai main kareeb 1000 mimi kii barish hui thi jisamen dub kar sainkadon log mar gaye the
 Many people died in the same car in which they were sitting and going home
 maharashtra sarkaar ne hoicourt main bataaya tha ki barish or uske baad kii beemaari se 1498 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Last year in Chennai, we all saw terrible devastation
 akele chennai main 269 log mare the
 Among many reasons, some reasons were that the river's land was occupied
 makaan ban gaye
 We often think that the river has dried up but do not see that water can also come from above
 aise vakt main nadi ke vistaar kii zamin par pani failane se baadh jaanaleva nahin ho paati he
 Layers of cement are being laid on the soil and a land of dreams is being formed by taking possession of the pond or the land for expansion of water
 ham media kii ek ajeeb samasya he
 How excited are the floods in the cities because the urban media is now occupied by the people
 unheen shahari logon kaa jinka shahar ke nadi naalon kii zamin par kabja ho gaya he
 Otherwise, a flood has also occurred in a large area of india
 media un khabaron ko bhi dikhaa rahaa he lekin us gusse or uttejnaa kii pratikriya main nahin jiske kaaran gudgaanv ko lekar sab baichaiyn ho gaye
 The comments hamaare sahyogi alok pandey lagaataar is par report file kar rahe hai
 According to their report, 17 lakh people have been displaced by the floods in Assam
 apper assam ke sainkadon gaanv pani main duube hue hai
 People are living in 2000 relief camps
 zarur gudgaanv ke scale se pachaas guna zyada raahat kaary chal rahaa hoga
 The death toll in this severe flood is stated to be 21
 ab aap isi antar ko samajhiye
 Where there is a place to spread the water of the river, the death toll is low even after the severe flood
 mumbai, chennai main saikadon log shahar kii sadak par dub kar mar gaye jise ham gaanv se behatar or surakshit samajhate hai
 Now if we do not understand these questions, then write as much as you wish on Twitter, nothing is to happen
 zaraa apane shahar ke un prakritik ilaakon kaa bhi pataa kiijie jahaan kabhi barsaat kaa pani failata hoga
 What happened to those natural areas? gudgaanv kii traasadee kii kahani kaa raaj trephic jam yaa naale ke over flo hone yaa nigamon ke karmchaariyon kii sankhya kam hone main hi nahin he
 These pictures are also what you are seeing
 jab aap shahar main sirf kaaron ke nikalne kaa rasta banaayenge, pani ke nikalne kaa rasta nahin banaayenge to aisi sthiti kaa saamana karnaa hi padegaa
 a worse situation is going to happen in the coming days
 gudgaanv ke jam ko gurujam kaha ja rahaa he
 We never heard such a disturbance of the word Guru
 pracheen kaal main guru hona kitna acha hota tha, aadhunik kaal main guru kaa matlab ab gurujam ho jayega isaki bhavishyavaanee maine kisi granth main nahin padhi thi
 Gurgaon has received between 40 and 50 mm of rain
 monsoon ke dinon main ye barish bahut bhayankar nahin he
 It is considered common, yet why such a situation happened
 tasviren vaaki daraane vaali hai
 Being stuck in a jam for four to eight hours, the body bladder and the radiator of the vehicle would have started to respond
 wo din dur nahin jab kaaron main apatkaali baio toilet banane lagenge
 This jam in Gurgaon has made people cry
 madhyamvargeey jivan ke do pramukh sapanom main se ek car ko log raste par hi chhod paidal apane duusare sapane kii taraf chal diye jise ham flats kehete hai
 Many cars died prematurely i
e
 the engine ceased
 inaki marammat par kitna kharch aayega, daftaron se iske liye chuttee milegi ki nahin, ram jane
 The ambulance was also trapped, but a group of conscious citizens left their worries and somehow pulled out the ambulance
 pichley bees saal main hamen do hi to sapane beche gaye hai
 Dream of a car and a house
 donon kii durgati aap dekh rahe hai
 In a city where there are hundreds of IT companies and in the coming days these companies are selling apps to solve some problem of India, not one of them has been able to make such an app which can liberate us from such a jam
 balki ulta log gurugram ke iti city kahe jane ko hi gariyaane lage
 His patience began to break
 ve milinium city kahe jane ko gariyaane lage
 Then, after taking away the moral burden of Indian culture, they started calling themselves Gurugram
 logon ko yah bhi khyaal nahin rahaa ki gurugram kaa mazaaq udaane par guru dron kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 News channels were not free from fake nationalism or else they used to call the people trapped in the jam from traitor to criminal
 batch gaye gurugram vaale
 When the pictures of the jam started going viral on Twitter, the light of the cars actually started looking like that darkness, which no one was thinking of the way to overcome
 logon ko laga ki twit kar dene se shahari vyavastha main sudhaar aa jayega
 Government will do something to save the image
 jaisaa logon kaa satahi gussa vaisaa hi sarkaar kaa satahi upaay or aashwaasan
 Information came that two officers were being sent
 he janata janardan thodaa to samajhiye ki do adhikari jaakar dashakon se gudgaanv main paidaa kii gai samasya kaa nidaan nahin kar sakenge
 Now we talk about the reactions of the Twitter world, which has not been claimed till 5000 years ago
 gurugram main twitor kaa naam abhi tak twitor hi he
 It is very difficult to understand the mental tortures of those trapped in a sixteen hour jam
 @gauravpandhi Tweet1 Gurgaon to Gurugram! Not just a name, the government wants to take us back to the era of Guru Dronacharya, 5000 years ago
 baiylgaadee le lo
 @suhelseth Tweet2 @amitshah: logon ne sushasan ke liye haryana main bijepi ko vot diya
 But ML Khattar was annihilated
 gudgaanv ek jhil he, shahar nahin! unhen hatie
 @sushantsareen Tweet3 har shahar jiskaa bhartiyata ke liye naam badla gaya, koi faaydaa nahin hua- bombai, bangalore, madras, kalakatta, gudgaanv
 @coolfunnytshirt Tweet4 mujhe lagata he, ab samay aa gaya he ki gudgaanv main ola shuru kare ola boat, ola cruge, ola sabamarine
 @sadhavi Tweet5 acha
 
 ye milinium city he
 
 oh
 
 smart city
 ML Khattar is making sure that it is like his new name Gurugram
 @raydeep Tweet6 Gurugram is called the Millennium City, but it seems unlikely that it will become a city in the next century
 gurugram yaa gudgobar
 @mpalso Tweet7 trephic kii samasya kii vajah se skulon ne chuttee ghoshit kii he
 Welcome to Millennium City Gurgaon haryana kii kareeb 35% aay gudgaanv se aati he
 Gurgaon has many names
 gurugram naam kii ghoshnaa hui he magar notification jari nahin hua he
 The government did not release the notifications but the media started writing Gurugram
 hindustan times ne 21 may 2016 ko ziladhikari tii el satyaprakash kaa bayaan chapa he ki gudgaanv ko gurugram karne kaa koi notification jari nahin hua he
 In the order issued by the District Magistrate on Friday, Gurugram is also not written, but Gurgaon is written
 jabaki gurugram karne kii ghoshnaa 12 april ko hui thi
 When it takes so much time to change the name, understand that it will take two years to build a drain and install a traffic light
 gurugram se pehle logon ne gudgaanv ko pyaar dulaar se bharat kaa singapore kaha, iti city kaha, milinium city kaha
 Now the residents of this place are also mocking these names
 yahaan tak guru dron ke naam par rakhe gaye gurugram ko lekar mazaaq udaaya gaya, maukey kii nazaakat ko dekhte hue aisi baton par aahat hone waalon kii toli bhi ignor karne lagi
 just as well
 vaise bhi log aadhunik shahar kii haalat se naaraaz he
 Traffic jams would not happen in the mythological period
 baharhaal jam se itnaa khuf fail gaya ki prashasan ne skulon ko band kar diya
 And that section 144 was imposed which is imposed at the time of every stream
 chaahe aap dhara ke saath bahen yaa dhara ke kilaaf bahen, dhara 144 ke bina aap kahin nahin bah sakate hai
 Flood, drought, storm, dharna demonstrations are all Section 144
 prashasan kii nigaah main prakritik or janatantric donon hi aapadaa hai
 That is why Section 144 is used to stop the democratic upsurge, the same happens during natural storms
 dhara brands ke sarso tel kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 Gurgaon district magistrate TL Satyaprakash has said that there has been unprecedented rainfall in Gurgaon
 bahut sara pani dilli se gudgaanv main aa rahaa he
 Car engines have failed, jammed in many places for more than 12 hours, in view of the possibility of heavy rains in the next 15 days, i am ordering Section 144
 saare agenciyon ko aadesh diya jaataa he ki ve sahi daron par upkarnon ko kiraaye par lekar shahar main lage jam se mukti ke kaam main jute jaaen
 All contractors must cooperate with the Civic Agency
 prashasan satark ho gaya he
 The District Magistrate has ordered that the Corporation Commissioner deploy a sufficient number of home guards for the end of September
 inase trephic prabandhan kaa kaam karavaaya jaae
 The expenses incurred on these will be paid by the CEO of Sheetla Mata Temple Board
 gudgaanv kii samasya ko lekar kya ham sahi tareeke se pratikriya vyakt kar rahe hai
 If there are crores of flats there, then the corporation of Gurgaon will also get tax
 new gurugram kii 100 ke kareeb resident welfare association kii ek sheersh sanstha he gudgaanv citigen council
 is
 inke adhyaksh aar es rathi se hamane kuch jaankaree lee he
 Huda is here to build the infrastructure
 haryana deveopment athurity ko huda kehete hai
 Master Road, Master Sewage, Master Drain, Water Supply is made by HUDA
 houseing sosayadi ke bheetar kaa dhaancha, sadak se lekar sivej tak builder ke jimme aayaa
 In a way, the responsibility of the government was to build an external road or drain
 rathi sahab ne bataaya ki yahaan ke resident welfare association kii taraf se bahari vikaas ke naam par 17,000 karod rupee huda ko diye gaye hai
 The Gurgaon Citizen Council has also filed a case in the Supreme Court regarding the tax being levied on us and where it is being spent
 2013 main huda ne supreme court main likhit halafanama diya tha ki huda ne metro ko milakar 17000 karod main sirf 5500 karod hi kharch kiye hai
 HUDA has no budget
 jahaan vibhaag ko uchit lagata he vibhaag kharch karata he
 Rathi ji said that the Municipal Corporation was established in Gurgaon in 2008 but the Municipal Corporation was not given any rights till 2013
 house tex se jo paise aate hai wo nagar nigam ke paas rahete hai or stamp duty se jo paise aate hai wo rajya sarkaar nigam ko nahin detii he
 i wish we had the government as well, but according to Rathi ji, the result is that the Municipal Corporation does not have money for development
 regular staff nahin he
 Gurugram has 35 wards
 prati ward kareeb 25-30 safai karmchaaree yaa nigam karmchaaree hai
 This number is not sufficient according to the need of the city

 Through this drain, the water of Gurugram used to pass through Hero Honda Chowk to the Nazafgarh drain
 is dren ke upar haive bana diya gaya or iske swaabhaavik pravaah ko band kar diya gaya
 As a result, the water of Badshah Pur Nala started coming up and filled the same city back

 Six six feet of water was filled

 After that Mehrauli Road was blocked

 Such accidents are happening continuously in our cities
 ham lagaataar bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 On July 26, 2005, that is, 11 years ago, Mumbai received about 1000 mm of rain, in which hundreds of people drowned and died
 kai logon kii maut usee car main ho gai thi jisamen baithe baithe ghar ja rahe the
 The Maharashtra government had told the High Court that 1498 people died due to rain and subsequent illness
 pichley saal chennai main bhi ham sabane bhayankar tabaahi dekhi thi
 In Chennai alone, 269 people died
 kai kaarnon main kuch kaaran yah bhi the ki nadi kii zamin par kabja ho gaya
 Houses were built
 ham aksar samajhate hai ki nadi suukh gai he magar yah nahin dekhte ki pani upar se bhi aa saktaa he
 At such a time, flooding is not fatal due to the spread of water on the river's expanding land
 mitti ke upar cement kii paraten bichaai ja rahi hai or talab yaa pani ke vistaar kii zamin ko kabje main lekar sapanom kii sosayadi ban rahi he
 We have a strange media problem
 shaharon main baadh jam ko lekar kitne uttejit ho jate hai kyonki ab ke media par shahari logon kaa hi kabza he
 The same urban people who have occupied the land of the river drains of the city
 varna baadh to hindustan ke ek bade ilaake main bhi ai he
 The media is also showing those news but not in response to the anger and excitement which caused everyone to become restless about Gurgaon
 tippaniyan Our colleague Alok Pandey is continuously filing reports on this
 unki report ke anusaar assam main 17 lakh log baadh se visthapit hue hai
 Hundreds of villages in Upper Assam are submerged
 2000 raahat shiviron main log rah rahe hai
 Surely, relief work is going on fifty times more than the scale of Gurgaon
 is bhayankar baadh main marane waalon kii sankhya 21 bataai gai he
 Now you understand this difference
 jahaan jahaan nadi ke pani ko failane kii jagah he vahaan vahaan bhayankar baadh ke baad bhi marane waalon kii sankhya kam he
 Hundreds of people died in Mumbai, Chennai by drowning on the city road which we think is better and safer than the village
 ab agar ham in sawaalon ko nahin samajhenge to twitor par jitna marzi likh len, hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Just find out the natural areas of your city where the rainy water will sometimes spread
 kya hua un prakritik ilaakon kaa
 The secret of the Gurgaon tragedy lies not in the traffic jams or overflows of the drain or the reduction in the number of employees of the corporations
 in tasveeron main bhi he jo aap dekh rahe hai
 You will have to face such a situation when you will only make a way for cars to leave the city, and do not make a way for water to leave
 aane vaale dinon main isse bhi buree sthiti hone vaali he
 The jam of Gurgaon is being called Gurujam
 guru shabd kii aisi fajihat hamane kabhi nahin suni
 i had not read the prophecy in any scripture about how good it was to be a guru in ancient times, in modern times, Guru would mean Gurujam
 gudgaanv main 40 se 50 mimi ke bich barish hui he
 These rains are not very severe during the monsoon days
 aam hi maani jaati he, phir bhi aisi haalat kyon hui
 In a city where there are hundreds of IT companies and in the coming days these companies are selling apps to solve some problem of India, not one of them has been able to make such an app which can liberate us from such a jam
 balki ulta log gurugram ke iti city kahe jane ko hi gariyaane lage
 His patience began to break
 ve milinium city kahe jane ko gariyaane lage
 Then, after taking away the moral burden of Indian culture, they started calling themselves Gurugram
 logon ko yah bhi khyaal nahin rahaa ki gurugram kaa mazaaq udaane par guru dron kaa mazaaq ud rahaa he
 News channels were not free from fake nationalism or else they used to call the people trapped in the jam from traitor to criminal
 batch gaye gurugram vaale
 When the pictures of the jam started going viral on Twitter, the light of the cars actually started looking like that darkness, which no one was thinking of the way to overcome
 logon ko laga ki twit kar dene se shahari vyavastha main sudhaar aa jayega
 Government will do something to save the image
 jaisaa logon kaa satahi gussa vaisaa hi sarkaar kaa satahi upaay or aashwaasan
 Information came that two officers were being sent
 he janata janardan thodaa to samajhiye ki do adhikari jaakar dashakon se gudgaanv main paidaa kii gai samasya kaa nidaan nahin kar sakenge
 Now we talk about the reactions of the Twitter world, which has not been claimed till 5000 years ago
 gurugram main twitor kaa naam abhi tak twitor hi he
 It is very difficult to understand the mental tortures of those trapped in a sixteen hour jam

 About 35% of Haryana's income comes from Gurgaon
 gudgaanv ke kai naam hai
 The name Gurugram has been announced but the notification has not been issued
 sarkaar ne notification tak jari nahin kiya magar media ne gurugram likhnaa shuru kar diya
 On 21 May 2016, Hindustan Times published a statement by District Magistrate TL Satyaprakash that no notification has been issued to Gurugram to Gurgaon
 shuukravaar ko ziladhikari ne jo aadesh jari kiye hai usamen bhi gurugram nahin likhaa he, balki gudgaanv likhaa he
 Whereas Gurugram was announced on 12 April
 jab naam badalane main itnaa time lag jaataa he to samajhiye naala banane or trephic lite lagane main saal do saal to lagegaa na

 The name Gurugram has been announced but the notification has not been issued
 sarkaar ne notification tak jari nahin kiya magar media ne gurugram likhnaa shuru kar diya
 On 21 May 2016, Hindustan Times published a statement by District Magistrate TL Satyaprakash that no notification has been issued to Gurgaon to Gurugram
 shuukravaar ko ziladhikari ne jo aadesh jari kiye hai usamen bhi gurugram nahin likhaa he, balki gudgaanv likhaa he
 Whereas Gurugram was announced on 12 April
 jab naam badalane main itnaa time lag jaataa he to samajhiye naala banane or trephic lite lagane main saal do saal to lagegaa na
 Before Gurugram, people called Gurgaon as the Singapore of India with love, called IT City, called Millennium City
 ab vahaan ke nivasee inhen naamon kaa makhul bhi uda rahe hai
 Even the Gurugram named after Guru Drona was made fun of, in view of the chance of opportunity, the group of those who were hurt on such things started to ignore

 Anyway people are angry with the condition of the modern city
 puranic kaal main trephic jam thode na hota hoga
 However, there was so much fear from the jam that the administration closed the schools

 We have taken some information from its chairman RS Rathi
 yahaan par buniyadi dhaancha banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The Haryana Development Authority is called HUDA
 master road, master civej, master drenaj, water supplai banane kaa kaam huda kaa he

 Rathi Saheb said that Rs 17,000 crore has been given to HUDA in the name of external development by the Resident Welfare Association
 gudgaanv citigen council ne supreme court main ise lekar cese bhi kiya he ki hamaare upar jo tex lage hai wo kahaan kahaan kharch ho rahe hai ye bataaiye
 In 2013, HUDA gave a written affidavit in the Supreme Court that HUDA spent only 5500 crores out of 17000 crores including metro
 huda kaa koi bajet nahin hota he
 The department spends where it deems appropriate
 rathi ji ne bataaya ki gudgaanv main 2008 main nagar nigam kii sthapana hui lekin nagar nigam ko 2013 tak koi adhikaar nahin diya gaya
 The money that comes from house tax stays with the Municipal Corporation and the state government does not give the money that comes from stamp duty to the corporation
 kaash ki hamaare paas sarkaar kaa bhi paksh hota lekin rathi ji ke anusaar iskaa nateeja yah hota he ki nagar nigam ke paas vikaas ke liye paise nahin hote hai

 jab tak ham in sawaalon main dilchaspee nahin lenge gurugram kaa bhala dhara 144 se nahin hoga
 Rathi Ji said that Badshah Pur Nala passes along Sohna Road
 is naale ke zariye hi gurugram kaa pani hero honda chowk se hote hue nazangarh dren main jaataa tha
 a highway was built over this drain and its natural flow was stopped
 nateeja yah hua ki badshaah poor naale kaa pani upar aane laga or waapas usee shahar ko bhar diya
 As a result, Jaipur Highway was blocked first
 chah chah foot pani bhar gaya
 Many vehicles were drowned
 uske baad mahrauli road block ho gaya
 As many sector roads are there, all those blocks of Gurugram went away

 gurugram yaa gudgobar
 @mpalso Tweet7 trephic kii samasya kii vajah se skulon ne chuttee ghoshit kii he
 Welcome to Millennium City Gurgaon haryana kii kareeb 35% aay gudgaanv se aati he
 Gurgaon has many names
 gurugram naam kii ghoshnaa hui he magar notification jari nahin hua he
 The government did not release the notifications but the media started writing Gurugram
 hindustan times ne 21 may 2016 ko ziladhikari tii el satyaprakash kaa bayaan chapa he ki gudgaanv ko gurugram karne kaa koi notification jari nahin hua he
 In the order issued by the District Magistrate on Friday, Gurugram is also not written, but Gurgaon is written
 jabaki gurugram karne kii ghoshnaa 12 april ko hui thi
 When it takes so much time to change the name, understand that it will take two years to build a drain and install a traffic light
 gurugram se pehle logon ne gudgaanv ko pyaar dulaar se bharat kaa singapore kaha, iti city kaha, milinium city kaha
 Now the residents of this place are also mocking these names
 yahaan tak guru dron ke naam par rakhe gaye gurugram ko lekar mazaaq udaaya gaya, maukey kii nazaakat ko dekhte hue aisi baton par aahat hone waalon kii toli bhi ignor karne lagi
 just as well
 vaise bhi log aadhunik shahar kii haalat se naaraaz he
 Traffic jams would not happen in the mythological period
 baharhaal jam se itnaa khuf fail gaya ki prashasan ne skulon ko band kar diya
 And that section 144 was imposed which is imposed at the time of every stream
 chaahe aap dhara ke saath bahen yaa dhara ke kilaaf bahen, dhara 144 ke bina aap kahin nahin bah sakate hai
 Flood, drought, storm, dharna demonstrations are all Section 144
 prashasan kii nigaah main prakritik or janatantric donon hi aapadaa hai
 That is why Section 144 is used to stop the democratic upsurge, the same happens during natural storms
 dhara brands ke sarso tel kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 Gurgaon district magistrate TL Satyaprakash has said that there has been unprecedented rainfall in Gurgaon
 bahut sara pani dilli se gudgaanv main aa rahaa he
 Car engines have failed, jammed in many places for more than 12 hours, in view of the possibility of heavy rains in the next 15 days, i am ordering Section 144
 saare agenciyon ko aadesh diya jaataa he ki ve sahi daron par upkarnon ko kiraaye par lekar shahar main lage jam se mukti ke kaam main jute jaaen
 All contractors must cooperate with the Civic Agency
 prashasan satark ho gaya he
 The District Magistrate has ordered that the Corporation Commissioner deploy a sufficient number of home guards for the end of September
 inase trephic prabandhan kaa kaam karavaaya jaae
 The expenses incurred on these will be paid by the CEO of Sheetla Mata Temple Board
 gudgaanv kii samasya ko lekar kya ham sahi tareeke se pratikriya vyakt kar rahe hai
 If there are crores of flats there, then the corporation of Gurgaon will also get tax
 new gurugram kii 100 ke kareeb resident welfare association kii ek sheersh sanstha he gudgaanv citigen council
 is
 inke adhyaksh aar es rathi se hamane kuch jaankaree lee he
 Huda is here to build the infrastructure
 haryana deveopment athurity ko huda kehete hai
 Master Road, Master Sewage, Master Drain, Water Supply is made by HUDA
 houseing sosayadi ke bheetar kaa dhaancha, sadak se lekar sivej tak builder ke jimme aayaa
 In a way, the responsibility of the government was to build an external road or drain
 rathi sahab ne bataaya ki yahaan ke resident welfare association kii taraf se bahari vikaas ke naam par 17,000 karod rupee huda ko diye gaye hai
 The Gurgaon Citizen Council has also filed a case in the Supreme Court regarding the tax being levied on us and where it is being spent
 2013 main huda ne supreme court main likhit halafanama diya tha ki huda ne metro ko milakar 17000 karod main sirf 5500 karod hi kharch kiye hai
 HUDA has no budget
 jahaan vibhaag ko uchit lagata he vibhaag kharch karata he
 Rathi ji said that the Municipal Corporation was established in Gurgaon in 2008 but the Municipal Corporation was not given any rights till 2013
 house tex se jo paise aate hai wo nagar nigam ke paas rahete hai or stamp duty se jo paise aate hai wo rajya sarkaar nigam ko nahin detii he
 i wish we had the government as well, but according to Rathi ji, the result is that the Municipal Corporation does not have money for development
 regular staff nahin he
 Gurugram has 35 wards
 prati ward kareeb 25-30 safai karmchaaree yaa nigam karmchaaree hai
 This number is not sufficient according to the need of the city
 nigam kaa prastaavik bajet 1600 karod kaa he lekin unhen miltaa 400 karod he
 Unless we are not interested in these questions, Gurugram will not benefit from Section 144
 rathi ji ne kaha ki sohana road ke saath-saath badshaah poor naala guzarataa he
 Through this drain, the water of Gurugram used to pass through Hero Honda Chowk to the Nazafgarh drain
 is dren ke upar haive bana diya gaya or iske swaabhaavik pravaah ko band kar diya gaya
 As a result, the water of Badshah Pur Nala started coming up and filled the same city back
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki pehle jaipur haive block ho gaya
 Six six feet of water was filled
 kai gaadiyaan dub gayi
 After that Mehrauli Road was blocked
 jitne bhi sector road hai gurugram ke wo saare black hote chale gaye
 Vehicles started getting stuck
 haalat yah ho gai ki raat ko border security force ko bulaayaa gaya, phir bhi sadak khul nahin pai
 Rathi Sahab said that the anger of the people is powerful
 sadak khulte hi bhul jaaenge
 They said that they have been fighting over these issues for fifteen years, but people do not come
 naam ko lekar tukbandi ke zariye logon kaa yah gussa bataata he ki ham buniyadi sawaalon se kitne dur ho gaye hai
 We have been suffering from traffic jams for many years
 dilli mumbai, bangaloru ke log
 The people of Bangalore have now started catching fish in the rainy waters
 saanp bhi nikal aayaa
 If we continue to occupy the land of animals and settle in a smart city, then one day they will come out and come to wrap in our feet
 tivi kaa media kisi farzi rashtrawaad kaa kissa roj sunaakar aapako bhadakaata rahata he lekin aise sawaalon par tabhi lautataa he jab aap kisi jam main funs kar baukhala jate hai
 Such accidents are happening continuously in our cities
 ham lagaataar bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 On July 26, 2005, that is, 11 years ago, Mumbai received about 1000 mm of rain, in which hundreds of people drowned and died
 kai logon kii maut usee car main ho gai thi jisamen baithe baithe ghar ja rahe the
 The Maharashtra government had told the High Court that 1498 people died due to rain and subsequent illness
 pichley saal chennai main bhi ham sabane bhayankar tabaahi dekhi thi
 In Chennai alone, 269 people died
 kai kaarnon main kuch kaaran yah bhi the ki nadi kii zamin par kabja ho gaya
 Houses were built
 ham aksar samajhate hai ki nadi suukh gai he magar yah nahin dekhte ki pani upar se bhi aa saktaa he
 At such a time, flooding is not fatal due to the spread of water on the river's expanding land
 mitti ke upar cement kii paraten bichaai ja rahi hai or talab yaa pani ke vistaar kii zamin ko kabje main lekar sapanom kii sosayadi ban rahi he
 We have a strange media problem
 shaharon main baadh jam ko lekar kitne uttejit ho jate hai kyonki ab ke media par shahari logon kaa hi kabza he
 The same urban people who have occupied the land of the river drains of the city
 varna baadh to hindustan ke ek bade ilaake main bhi ai he
 The media is also showing those news but not in response to the anger and excitement which caused everyone to become restless about Gurgaon
 tippaniyan Our colleague Alok Pandey is continuously filing reports on this
 unki report ke anusaar assam main 17 lakh log baadh se visthapit hue hai
 Hundreds of villages in Upper Assam are submerged
 2000 raahat shiviron main log rah rahe hai
 Surely, relief work is going on fifty times more than the scale of Gurgaon
 is bhayankar baadh main marane waalon kii sankhya 21 bataai gai he
 Now you understand this difference
 jahaan jahaan nadi ke pani ko failane kii jagah he vahaan vahaan bhayankar baadh ke baad bhi marane waalon kii sankhya kam he
 Hundreds of people died in Mumbai, Chennai by drowning on the city road which we think is better and safer than the village
 ab agar ham in sawaalon ko nahin samajhenge to twitor par jitna marzi likh len, hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Just find out the natural areas of your city where the rainy water will sometimes spread
 kya hua un prakritik ilaakon kaa
 The secret of the Gurgaon tragedy lies not in the traffic jams or overflows of the drain or the reduction in the number of employees of the corporations
 in tasveeron main bhi he jo aap dekh rahe hai
 You will have to face such a situation when you will only make a way for cars to leave the city, and do not make a way for water to leave
 aane vaale dinon main isse bhi buree sthiti hone vaali he
 The jam of Gurgaon is being called Gurujam
 guru shabd kii aisi fajihat hamane kabhi nahin suni
 i had not read the prophecy in any scripture about how good it was to be a guru in ancient times, in modern times, Guru would mean Gurujam
 gudgaanv main 40 se 50 mimi ke bich barish hui he
 These rains are not very severe during the monsoon days
 aam hi maani jaati he, phir bhi aisi haalat kyon hui
 @mpalso Tweet7 trephic kii samasya kii vajah se skulon ne chuttee ghoshit kii he

 jabaki gurugram karne kii ghoshnaa 12 april ko hui thi
 When it takes so much time to change the name, understand that it will take two years to build a drain and install a traffic light
 gurugram se pehle logon ne gudgaanv ko pyaar dulaar se bharat kaa singapore kaha, iti city kaha, milinium city kaha
 Now the residents of this place are also mocking these names
 yahaan tak guru dron ke naam par rakhe gaye gurugram ko lekar mazaaq udaaya gaya, maukey kii nazaakat ko dekhte hue aisi baton par aahat hone waalon kii toli bhi ignor karne lagi
 just as well
 vaise bhi log aadhunik shahar kii haalat se naaraaz he
 Traffic jams would not happen in the mythological period
 baharhaal jam se itnaa khuf fail gaya ki prashasan ne skulon ko band kar diya
 And that section 144 was imposed which is imposed at the time of every stream
 chaahe aap dhara ke saath bahen yaa dhara ke kilaaf bahen, dhara 144 ke bina aap kahin nahin bah sakate hai
 Flood, drought, storm, dharna demonstrations are all Section 144
 prashasan kii nigaah main prakritik or janatantric donon hi aapadaa hai
 That is why Section 144 is used to stop the democratic upsurge, the same happens during natural storms
 dhara brands ke sarso tel kii baat nahin kar rahaa hum
 Gurgaon district magistrate TL Satyaprakash has said that there has been unprecedented rainfall in Gurgaon
 bahut sara pani dilli se gudgaanv main aa rahaa he
 Car engines have failed, jammed in many places for more than 12 hours, in view of the possibility of heavy rains in the next 15 days, i am ordering Section 144
 saare agenciyon ko aadesh diya jaataa he ki ve sahi daron par upkarnon ko kiraaye par lekar shahar main lage jam se mukti ke kaam main jute jaaen
 All contractors must cooperate with the Civic Agency
 prashasan satark ho gaya he
 The District Magistrate has ordered that the Corporation Commissioner deploy a sufficient number of home guards for the end of September
 inase trephic prabandhan kaa kaam karavaaya jaae
 The expenses incurred on these will be paid by the CEO of Sheetla Mata Temple Board
 gudgaanv kii samasya ko lekar kya ham sahi tareeke se pratikriya vyakt kar rahe hai
 If there are crores of flats there, then the corporation of Gurgaon will also get tax
 new gurugram kii 100 ke kareeb resident welfare association kii ek sheersh sanstha he gudgaanv citigen council
 is
 inke adhyaksh aar es rathi se hamane kuch jaankaree lee he
 Huda is here to build the infrastructure
 haryana deveopment athurity ko huda kehete hai
 Master Road, Master Sewage, Master Drain, Water Supply is made by HUDA
 houseing sosayadi ke bheetar kaa dhaancha, sadak se lekar sivej tak builder ke jimme aayaa
 In a way, the responsibility of the government was to build an external road or drain
 rathi sahab ne bataaya ki yahaan ke resident welfare association kii taraf se bahari vikaas ke naam par 17,000 karod rupee huda ko diye gaye hai
 The Gurgaon Citizen Council has also filed a case in the Supreme Court regarding the tax being levied on us and where it is being spent
 2013 main huda ne supreme court main likhit halafanama diya tha ki huda ne metro ko milakar 17000 karod main sirf 5500 karod hi kharch kiye hai
 HUDA has no budget
 jahaan vibhaag ko uchit lagata he vibhaag kharch karata he
 Rathi ji said that the Municipal Corporation was established in Gurgaon in 2008 but the Municipal Corporation was not given any rights till 2013
 house tex se jo paise aate hai wo nagar nigam ke paas rahete hai or stamp duty se jo paise aate hai wo rajya sarkaar nigam ko nahin detii he
 i wish we had the government as well, but according to Rathi ji, the result is that the Municipal Corporation does not have money for development
 regular staff nahin he
 Gurugram has 35 wards
 prati ward kareeb 25-30 safai karmchaaree yaa nigam karmchaaree hai
 This number is not sufficient according to the need of the city
 nigam kaa prastaavik bajet 1600 karod kaa he lekin unhen miltaa 400 karod he
 Unless we are not interested in these questions, Gurugram will not benefit from Section 144
 rathi ji ne kaha ki sohana road ke saath-saath badshaah poor naala guzarataa he
 Through this drain, the water of Gurugram used to pass through Hero Honda Chowk to the Nazafgarh drain
 is dren ke upar haive bana diya gaya or iske swaabhaavik pravaah ko band kar diya gaya
 As a result, the water of Badshah Pur Nala started coming up and filled the same city back
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki pehle jaipur haive block ho gaya
 Six six feet of water was filled
 kai gaadiyaan dub gayi
 After that Mehrauli Road was blocked
 jitne bhi sector road hai gurugram ke wo saare black hote chale gaye
 Vehicles started getting stuck
 haalat yah ho gai ki raat ko border security force ko bulaayaa gaya, phir bhi sadak khul nahin pai
 Rathi Sahab said that the anger of the people is powerful
 sadak khulte hi bhul jaaenge
 They said that they have been fighting over these issues for fifteen years, but people do not come
 naam ko lekar tukbandi ke zariye logon kaa yah gussa bataata he ki ham buniyadi sawaalon se kitne dur ho gaye hai
 We have been suffering from traffic jams for many years
 dilli mumbai, bangaloru ke log
 The people of Bangalore have now started catching fish in the rainy waters
 saanp bhi nikal aayaa
 If we continue to occupy the land of animals and settle in a smart city, then one day they will come out and come to wrap in our feet
 tivi kaa media kisi farzi rashtrawaad kaa kissa roj sunaakar aapako bhadakaata rahata he lekin aise sawaalon par tabhi lautataa he jab aap kisi jam main funs kar baukhala jate hai
 Such accidents are happening continuously in our cities
 ham lagaataar bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 On July 26, 2005, that is, 11 years ago, Mumbai received about 1000 mm of rain, in which hundreds of people drowned and died
 kai logon kii maut usee car main ho gai thi jisamen baithe baithe ghar ja rahe the
 The Maharashtra government had told the High Court that 1498 people died due to rain and subsequent illness
 pichley saal chennai main bhi ham sabane bhayankar tabaahi dekhi thi
 In Chennai alone, 269 people died
 kai kaarnon main kuch kaaran yah bhi the ki nadi kii zamin par kabja ho gaya
 Houses were built
 ham aksar samajhate hai ki nadi suukh gai he magar yah nahin dekhte ki pani upar se bhi aa saktaa he
 At such a time, flooding is not fatal due to the spread of water on the river's expanding land
 mitti ke upar cement kii paraten bichaai ja rahi hai or talab yaa pani ke vistaar kii zamin ko kabje main lekar sapanom kii sosayadi ban rahi he
 We have a strange media problem
 shaharon main baadh jam ko lekar kitne uttejit ho jate hai kyonki ab ke media par shahari logon kaa hi kabza he
 The same urban people who have occupied the land of the river drains of the city
 varna baadh to hindustan ke ek bade ilaake main bhi ai he
 The media is also showing those news but not in response to the anger and excitement which caused everyone to become restless about Gurgaon
 tippaniyan Our colleague Alok Pandey is continuously filing reports on this
 unki report ke anusaar assam main 17 lakh log baadh se visthapit hue hai
 Hundreds of villages in Upper Assam are submerged
 2000 raahat shiviron main log rah rahe hai
 Surely, relief work is going on fifty times more than the scale of Gurgaon
 is bhayankar baadh main marane waalon kii sankhya 21 bataai gai he
 Now you understand this difference
 jahaan jahaan nadi ke pani ko failane kii jagah he vahaan vahaan bhayankar baadh ke baad bhi marane waalon kii sankhya kam he
 Hundreds of people died in Mumbai, Chennai by drowning on the city road which we think is better and safer than the village
 ab agar ham in sawaalon ko nahin samajhenge to twitor par jitna marzi likh len, hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Just find out the natural areas of your city where the rainy water will sometimes spread
 kya hua un prakritik ilaakon kaa
 The secret of the Gurgaon tragedy lies not in the traffic jams or overflows of the drain or the reduction in the number of employees of the corporations
 in tasveeron main bhi he jo aap dekh rahe hai
 You will have to face such a situation when you will only make a way for cars to leave the city, and do not make a way for water to leave
 aane vaale dinon main isse bhi buree sthiti hone vaali he
 The jam of Gurgaon is being called Gurujam
 guru shabd kii aisi fajihat hamane kabhi nahin suni
 i had not read the prophecy in any scripture about how good it was to be a guru in ancient times, in modern times, Guru would mean Gurujam
 gudgaanv main 40 se 50 mimi ke bich barish hui he
 These rains are not very severe during the monsoon days

 gudgaanv main 40 se 50 mimi ke bich barish hui he
 These rains are not very severe during the monsoon days
 aam hi maani jaati he, phir bhi aisi haalat kyon hui
 However, there was so much fear from the jam that the administration closed the schools
 or wo dhara 144 laga di jo har dhara ke vakt laga di jaati he
 Whether you flow with the stream or against the stream, without section 144 you cannot flow anywhere
 baadh, sukhadh, tufaan, dharna pradarshan sabamein dhara 144 hi kaam aati he
 The administration has both natural and democratic disasters
 isiilie dhara 144 janatantric ubhaar ko rokane main lagati he vahi prakritik tufaan ke vakt bhi lagati he
 i am not talking about Dhara brand mustard oil
 gudgaanv ke ziladhikari tii el satyaprakash ne kaha he ki gudgaanv main apratyaashit barish hui he
 a lot of water is coming from Delhi to Gurgaon
 car ke ingine fail ho gaye hai, 12 ghante se zyada samay se kai jagahon par jam laga he, agle 15 din main baari barish kii ashanka ko dekhte hue main dhara 144 lagane ke aadesh de rahaa hum
 All agencies are ordered to rent equipment at the right rates and to get rid of the traffic jam
 sabhi thekedaaron ko civik agency ke saath sahyog karnaa hoga
 The administration has become cautious
 ziladhikari ne aadesh diya he ki sitambar ke ant ke liye nigam ayukta wo paryaapt sankhya main homeguard kii tainaati karen
 They should be made traffic management
 in par jo kharchaa aayega use sheetala mata mandir board ke siio bhugtan karenge
 Are we reacting correctly to the problem of Gurgaon
 agar vahaan karodon ke flats hai to gudgaanv ke nigam ko tex bhi milte honge
 Gurgaon Citizen Council is an apex body of around 100 Resident Welfare Association of New Gurugram
 he
 We have taken some information from its chairman RS Rathi
 yahaan par buniyadi dhaancha banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The Haryana Development Authority is called HUDA
 master road, master civej, master drenaj, water supplai banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The structure within the housing society, from road to sewage, came to the builder
 ek tarah se sarkaar ke jimme bahari sadak yaa naale vagraih banane ke hi kaam aae
 Rathi Saheb said that Rs 17,000 crore has been given to HUDA in the name of external development by the Resident Welfare Association
 gudgaanv citigen council ne supreme court main ise lekar cese bhi kiya he ki hamaare upar jo tex lage hai wo kahaan kahaan kharch ho rahe hai ye bataaiye
 In 2013, HUDA gave a written affidavit in the Supreme Court that HUDA spent only 5500 crores out of 17000 crores including metro
 huda kaa koi bajet nahin hota he
 The department spends where it deems appropriate
 rathi ji ne bataaya ki gudgaanv main 2008 main nagar nigam kii sthapana hui lekin nagar nigam ko 2013 tak koi adhikaar nahin diya gaya
 The money that comes from house tax stays with the Municipal Corporation and the state government does not give the money that comes from stamp duty to the corporation
 kaash ki hamaare paas sarkaar kaa bhi paksh hota lekin rathi ji ke anusaar iskaa nateeja yah hota he ki nagar nigam ke paas vikaas ke liye paise nahin hote hai
 There is no regular staff
 gurugram main 35 ward hai
 There are about 25–30 cleaning workers or corporation employees per ward
 shahar kii zarurat ke hisaab se yah sankhya paryaapt nahin he
 The proposed budget of the corporation is 1600 crores but they get 400 crores
 jab tak ham in sawaalon main dilchaspee nahin lenge gurugram kaa bhala dhara 144 se nahin hoga
 Rathi Ji said that Badshah Pur Nala passes along Sohna Road
 is naale ke zariye hi gurugram kaa pani hero honda chowk se hote hue nazangarh dren main jaataa tha
 a highway was built over this drain and its natural flow was stopped
 nateeja yah hua ki badshaah poor naale kaa pani upar aane laga or waapas usee shahar ko bhar diya
 As a result, Jaipur Highway was blocked first
 chah chah foot pani bhar gaya
 Many vehicles were drowned
 uske baad mahrauli road block ho gaya
 As many sector roads are there, all those blocks of Gurugram went away
 gaadiyaan funsane lageen
 The condition was that the Border Security Force was called at night, yet the road could not open
 rathi sahab ne kaha ki logon kaa gussa vakti he
 You will forget as soon as the road opens
 unhone kaha ki ve pandrah saal se in muddon ko lekar lard rahe hai magar log nahin aate hai
 This anger of the people through rhyme regarding the name tells us how far we have become from the basic questions
 trephic jam ko ham na jane kitne saal se bhugat rahe hai
 People from Delhi Mumbai, Bangalore
 bangaleru vaale to ab barsaat ke pani main machhlee bhi pakadaney lage hai
 The snake also came out
 agar ham jeev jantuon kii zamin ko isi tarah kabja kar smart city basaate rahe to wo ek din nikal kar hamaare paanvon main lipatane aaenge
 The media of TV keeps on telling you stories of fake nationalism every day, but returns to such questions only when you get stuck in a jam
 hamaare shaharon main aise haadase lagaataar hote ja rahe hai
 We are constantly forgetting
 26 july 2005 yani aaj se 11 saal pehle mumbai main kareeb 1000 mimi kii barish hui thi jisamen dub kar sainkadon log mar gaye the
 Many people died in the same car in which they were sitting and going home
 maharashtra sarkaar ne hoicourt main bataaya tha ki barish or uske baad kii beemaari se 1498 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Last year in Chennai, we all saw terrible devastation
 akele chennai main 269 log mare the
 Among many reasons, some reasons were that the river's land was occupied
 makaan ban gaye
 We often think that the river has dried up but do not see that water can also come from above
 aise vakt main nadi ke vistaar kii zamin par pani failane se baadh jaanaleva nahin ho paati he
 Layers of cement are being laid on the soil and a land of dreams is being formed by taking possession of the pond or the land for expansion of water
 ham media kii ek ajeeb samasya he
 How excited are the floods in the cities because the urban media is now occupied by the people
 unheen shahari logon kaa jinka shahar ke nadi naalon kii zamin par kabja ho gaya he
 Otherwise, a flood has also occurred in a large area of india
 media un khabaron ko bhi dikhaa rahaa he lekin us gusse or uttejnaa kii pratikriya main nahin jiske kaaran gudgaanv ko lekar sab baichaiyn ho gaye
 The comments hamaare sahyogi alok pandey lagaataar is par report file kar rahe hai
 According to their report, 17 lakh people have been displaced by the floods in Assam
 apper assam ke sainkadon gaanv pani main duube hue hai
 People are living in 2000 relief camps
 zarur gudgaanv ke scale se pachaas guna zyada raahat kaary chal rahaa hoga
 The death toll in this severe flood is stated to be 21
 ab aap isi antar ko samajhiye
 Where there is a place to spread the water of the river, the death toll is low even after the severe flood
 mumbai, chennai main saikadon log shahar kii sadak par dub kar mar gaye jise ham gaanv se behatar or surakshit samajhate hai
 Now if we do not understand these questions, then write as much as you wish on Twitter, nothing is to happen
 zaraa apane shahar ke un prakritik ilaakon kaa bhi pataa kiijie jahaan kabhi barsaat kaa pani failata hoga
 What happened to those natural areas? gudgaanv kii traasadee kii kahani kaa raaj trephic jam yaa naale ke over flo hone yaa nigamon ke karmchaariyon kii sankhya kam hone main hi nahin he
 These pictures are also what you are seeing
 jab aap shahar main sirf kaaron ke nikalne kaa rasta banaayenge, pani ke nikalne kaa rasta nahin banaayenge to aisi sthiti kaa saamana karnaa hi padegaa
 a worse situation is going to happen in the coming days
 gudgaanv ke jam ko gurujam kaha ja rahaa he
 We never heard such a disturbance of the word Guru
 pracheen kaal main guru hona kitna acha hota tha, aadhunik kaal main guru kaa matlab ab gurujam ho jayega isaki bhavishyavaanee maine kisi granth main nahin padhi thi
 Gurgaon has received between 40 and 50 mm of rain
 monsoon ke dinon main ye barish bahut bhayankar nahin he
 It is considered common, yet why such a situation happened
 prashasan satark ho gaya he
 The District Magistrate has ordered that the Corporation Commissioner deploy a sufficient number of home guards for the end of September
 inase trephic prabandhan kaa kaam karavaaya jaae
 The expenses incurred on these will be paid by the CEO of Sheetla Mata Temple Board
 gudgaanv kii samasya ko lekar kya ham sahi tareeke se pratikriya vyakt kar rahe hai
 If there are crores of flats there, then the corporation of Gurgaon will also get tax
 new gurugram kii 100 ke kareeb resident welfare association kii ek sheersh sanstha he gudgaanv citigen council
 is
 inke adhyaksh aar es rathi se hamane kuch jaankaree lee he
 Huda is here to build the infrastructure
 haryana deveopment athurity ko huda kehete hai
 Master Road, Master Sewage, Master Drain, Water Supply is made by HUDA
 houseing sosayadi ke bheetar kaa dhaancha, sadak se lekar sivej tak builder ke jimme aayaa
 In a way, the responsibility of the government was to build an external road or drain
 rathi sahab ne bataaya ki yahaan ke resident welfare association kii taraf se bahari vikaas ke naam par 17,000 karod rupee huda ko diye gaye hai
 The Gurgaon Citizen Council has also filed a case in the Supreme Court regarding the tax being levied on us and where it is being spent
 2013 main huda ne supreme court main likhit halafanama diya tha ki huda ne metro ko milakar 17000 karod main sirf 5500 karod hi kharch kiye hai
 HUDA has no budget
 jahaan vibhaag ko uchit lagata he vibhaag kharch karata he
 Rathi ji said that the Municipal Corporation was established in Gurgaon in 2008 but the Municipal Corporation was not given any rights till 2013
 house tex se jo paise aate hai wo nagar nigam ke paas rahete hai or stamp duty se jo paise aate hai wo rajya sarkaar nigam ko nahin detii he
 i wish we had the government as well, but according to Rathi ji, the result is that the Municipal Corporation does not have money for development
 regular staff nahin he
 Gurugram has 35 wards
 prati ward kareeb 25-30 safai karmchaaree yaa nigam karmchaaree hai
 This number is not sufficient according to the need of the city
 nigam kaa prastaavik bajet 1600 karod kaa he lekin unhen miltaa 400 karod he
 Unless we are not interested in these questions, Gurugram will not benefit from Section 144
 rathi ji ne kaha ki sohana road ke saath-saath badshaah poor naala guzarataa he
 Through this drain, the water of Gurugram used to pass through Hero Honda Chowk to the Nazafgarh drain
 is dren ke upar haive bana diya gaya or iske swaabhaavik pravaah ko band kar diya gaya
 As a result, the water of Badshah Pur Nala started coming up and filled the same city back
 iskaa nateeja yah hua ki pehle jaipur haive block ho gaya
 Six six feet of water was filled

 We have been suffering from traffic jams for many years
 dilli mumbai, bangaloru ke log
 The people of Bangalore have now started catching fish in the rainy waters
 saanp bhi nikal aayaa
 If we continue to occupy the land of animals and settle in a smart city, then one day they will come out and come to wrap in our feet

 Such accidents are happening continuously in our cities
 ham lagaataar bhoolatey ja rahe hai
 On July 26, 2005, that is, 11 years ago, Mumbai received about 1000 mm of rain, in which hundreds of people drowned and died
 kai logon kii maut usee car main ho gai thi jisamen baithe baithe ghar ja rahe the
 The Maharashtra government had told the High Court that 1498 people died due to rain and subsequent illness
 pichley saal chennai main bhi ham sabane bhayankar tabaahi dekhi thi
 In Chennai alone, 269 people died
 kai kaarnon main kuch kaaran yah bhi the ki nadi kii zamin par kabja ho gaya
 Houses were built
 ham aksar samajhate hai ki nadi suukh gai he magar yah nahin dekhte ki pani upar se bhi aa saktaa he
 At such a time, flooding is not fatal due to the spread of water on the river's expanding land
 mitti ke upar cement kii paraten bichaai ja rahi hai or talab yaa pani ke vistaar kii zamin ko kabje main lekar sapanom kii sosayadi ban rahi he
 We have a strange media problem
 shaharon main baadh jam ko lekar kitne uttejit ho jate hai kyonki ab ke media par shahari logon kaa hi kabza he
 The same urban people who have occupied the land of the river drains of the city
 varna baadh to hindustan ke ek bade ilaake main bhi ai he
 The media is also showing those news but not in response to the anger and excitement which caused everyone to become restless about Gurgaon
 tippaniyan Our colleague Alok Pandey is continuously filing reports on this
 unki report ke anusaar assam main 17 lakh log baadh se visthapit hue hai
 Hundreds of villages in Upper Assam are submerged
 2000 raahat shiviron main log rah rahe hai
 Surely, relief work is going on fifty times more than the scale of Gurgaon
 is bhayankar baadh main marane waalon kii sankhya 21 bataai gai he
 Now you understand this difference
 jahaan jahaan nadi ke pani ko failane kii jagah he vahaan vahaan bhayankar baadh ke baad bhi marane waalon kii sankhya kam he
 Hundreds of people died in Mumbai, Chennai by drowning on the city road which we think is better and safer than the village
 ab agar ham in sawaalon ko nahin samajhenge to twitor par jitna marzi likh len, hona janaa kuch nahin he
 Just find out the natural areas of your city where the rainy water will sometimes spread
 kya hua un prakritik ilaakon kaa
 The secret of the Gurgaon tragedy lies not in the traffic jams or overflows of the drain or the reduction in the number of employees of the corporations
 in tasveeron main bhi he jo aap dekh rahe hai
 You will have to face such a situation when you will only make a way for cars to leave the city, and do not make a way for water to leave
 aane vaale dinon main isse bhi buree sthiti hone vaali he
 The jam of Gurgaon is being called Gurujam
 guru shabd kii aisi fajihat hamane kabhi nahin suni
 i had not read the prophecy in any scripture about how good it was to be a guru in ancient times, in modern times, Guru would mean Gurujam
 gudgaanv main 40 se 50 mimi ke bich barish hui he
 These rains are not very severe during the monsoon days
 aam hi maani jaati he, phir bhi aisi haalat kyon hui
 Gurgaon Citizen Council is an apex body of around 100 Resident Welfare Association of New Gurugram
 he
 We have taken some information from its chairman RS Rathi
 yahaan par buniyadi dhaancha banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The Haryana Development Authority is called HUDA
 master road, master civej, master drenaj, water supplai banane kaa kaam huda kaa he
 The structure within the housing society, from road to sewage, came to the builder
 ek tarah se sarkaar ke jimme bahari sadak yaa naale vagraih banane ke hi kaam aae
 Rathi Saheb said that Rs 17,000 crore has been given to HUDA in the name of external development by the Resident Welfare Association
 gudgaanv citigen council ne supreme court main ise lekar cese bhi kiya he ki hamaare upar jo tex lage hai wo kahaan kahaan kharch ho rahe hai ye bataaiye
 In 2013, HUDA gave a written affidavit in the Supreme Court that HUDA spent only 5500 crores out of 17000 crores including metro
 huda kaa koi bajet nahin hota he
 The department spends where it deems appropriate
 rathi ji ne bataaya ki gudgaanv main 2008 main nagar nigam kii sthapana hui lekin nagar nigam ko 2013 tak koi adhikaar nahin diya gaya
 The money that comes from house tax stays with the Municipal Corporation and the state government does not give the money that comes from stamp duty to the corporation
 kaash ki hamaare paas sarkaar kaa bhi paksh hota lekin rathi ji ke anusaar iskaa nateeja yah hota he ki nagar nigam ke paas vikaas ke liye paise nahin hote hai
 There is no regular staff
 gurugram main 35 ward hai
 There are about 25–30 cleaning workers or corporation employees per ward
 shahar kii zarurat ke hisaab se yah sankhya paryaapt nahin he
 The proposed budget of the corporation is 1600 crores but they get 400 crores
 jab tak ham in sawaalon main dilchaspee nahin lenge gurugram kaa bhala dhara 144 se nahin hoga
 Rathi Ji said that Badshah Pur Nala passes along Sohna Road
 is naale ke zariye hi gurugram kaa pani hero honda chowk se hote hue nazangarh dren main jaataa tha
 a highway was built over this drain and its natural flow was stopped
 nateeja yah hua ki badshaah poor naale kaa pani upar aane laga or waapas usee shahar ko bhar diya
 As a result, Jaipur Highway was blocked first
 chah chah foot pani bhar gaya
 Many vehicles were drowned
 uske baad mahrauli road block ho gaya
 As many sector roads are there, all those blocks of Gurugram went away
 gaadiyaan funsane lageen
 The condition was that the Border Security Force was called at night, yet the road could not open
 rathi sahab ne kaha ki logon kaa gussa vakti he
 You will forget as soon as the road opens
 unhone kaha ki ve pandrah saal se in muddon ko lekar lard rahe hai magar log nahin aate hai
 This anger of the people through rhyme regarding the name tells us how far we have become from the basic questions
 trephic jam ko ham na jane kitne saal se bhugat rahe hai
 People from Delhi Mumbai, Bangalore
 bangaleru vaale to ab barsaat ke pani main machhlee bhi pakadaney lage hai
 The snake also came out
 agar ham jeev jantuon kii zamin ko isi tarah kabja kar smart city basaate rahe to wo ek din nikal kar hamaare paanvon main lipatane aaenge
 The media of TV keeps on telling you stories of fake nationalism every day, but returns to such questions only when you get stuck in a jam
 hamaare shaharon main aise haadase lagaataar hote ja rahe hai

 Last year in Chennai, we all saw terrible devastation
 akele chennai main 269 log mare the
 Among many reasons, some reasons were that the river's land was occupied

 We often think that the river has dried up but do not see that water can also come from above

 Layers of cement are being laid on the soil and a land of dreams is being formed by taking possession of the pond or the land for expansion of water
 ham media kii ek ajeeb samasya he
 How excited are the floods in the cities because the urban media is now occupied by the people
 unheen shahari logon kaa jinka shahar ke nadi naalon kii zamin par kabja ho gaya he
 Otherwise, a flood has also occurred in a large area of india

 People are living in 2000 relief camps

 The death toll in this severe flood is stated to be 21

 Where there is a place to spread the water of the river, the death toll is low even after the severe flood
 mumbai, chennai main saikadon log shahar kii sadak par dub kar mar gaye jise ham gaanv se behatar or surakshit samajhate hai
 Now if we do not understand these questions, then write as much as you wish on Twitter, nothing is to happen

 K) (@arshikofficial) on Jun 3, 2018 at 2:51am PDT So far, 40 CRPF personnel have been martyred in a terrorist attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama (jammu and Kashmir) Pulwama (pulwama Terrorist Attack)
 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama (pulwama Terror Attack) main jis car ne siarpief javaanon ke bas main takkar maar aatanki hamale ko anjaam diya, us car ko jaish-e-mohammad kaa aatankwaadi adil ahamed daar chalaa rahaa tha
 Terrorist Adil Ahmed was a resident of Dar Valley
 bataa den ki pulavama (pulwama Terror Attack) main yah visphot itnaa bada tha ki shaheedon kii sankhya main ijapha ho saktaa he
 Terrorist Adil Ahmed, also known as 'adil Ahmed the car raider' and the 'waqas Commandos of Gundibagh', joined the terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammed last year
 adil kacapora kaa rahane vaala tha
 Police say that the car that the terrorist Adil was driving contained 350 kg of explosives
 isi car ne jaakar siarpief ke bas main takkar maari, jisamen kareeb 40 jawan shahid ho gaye
 Please tell that the jawans were going in 43 buses
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki pichley saal yani 2018 main jaish-e-mohammad main shaamil hone ke baad se hi aatanki daar ghati main bade hamale ke firaaq main tha
 His videos and photos surfaced immediately after the attack
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki uri atake ke baad yah sabase bada hamalaa he, jisamen 19 jawan shahid hue the
 In the video which has surfaced, the terrorist is seen armed with dar weapons
 is hamale ke baad jaish-e-mohammad ne aatanki daar kaa ek video jari kiya
 It is believed that this video must have been shot before the suicide attack
 is video main uske peeche jaish-e-mohammad kaa binar dikh rahaa he
 PM Modi has expressed grief over the Pulwama terror attack
 piem modi ne kaha he ki pulavama main siarpief karmiyon par hamalaa kaayarta he
 i strongly condemn this atrocious attack
 hamaare bahadur surakshakarmiyon kaa balidaan vyarth nahin jayega
 The whole country stands shoulder to shoulder with the families of the brave martyrs
 ghayalon ke jald thik hone kii kaamana karata hum
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi has also expressed grief over this
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne somvaar ko kaha ki agar videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj yah bataa den ki unhen lalit modi ke khate se kitna paisa aayaa he to sansad main jari gatirodh khatm ho saktaa he
 Rahul told reporters, 'I asked Sushma ji a direct question about how much money came from Lalit Modi's account
 sushamaa is mudde par jawaab de den to sansad chal jaaegi
 ' unhone aage kaha, sushamaa ne ek apradhi kii madad kii he
 He should clearly state how much money his family received from Lalit Modi
 congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, ham is baat se sahamat hai ki sansad main kaamkaaj hona chahie
 But we have raised the basic issue
 hamane kaha or teen baar kaha he ki sushamaa swaraj ji, madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri or rajasthan ke mukhyamantri ne kuch maamalon main avaidh kaam kiya he
 There have been murders in Madhya Pradesh
 lekin pradhanmantri ko yah jaruri nahin lagata he ki ve isaki ninda karen
 The comments rahul ne kaha, vah (piem modi) mukhyamantriyon kii saraahna karte hai
 He completely ignores that his Chief Minister ruined the future of thousands of people
 pradhanmantri ne ek apradhi or rajasthan kii unki mukhyamantri ke bich vyavsaayik sambandhon ko puri tarah se najrandaaj kar diya
 In fact, since the start of the monsoon session, the Congress has been demanding the resignation of Sushma Swaraj, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Vasundhara Raje
 vah lihaaja, 21 july ko shuru hue satr main congress or vipaksh ke virodh ke chalate ek din bhi kaamkaaj nahin ho paaya he

 He further said, Sushma has helped a criminal
 vah yah spasht bataaen ki unke parivaar ke paas lalit modi kii taraf se kitna paisa aayaa
 The Congress vice-president said, "we agree that there should be business in Parliament
" lekin hamane buniyadi mudda uthaaya he
 We have said and said thrice that Sushma Swaraj, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh and the Chief Minister of Rajasthan have done illegal work in some cases
 madhya pradesh main hatyaein hui hai
 But the Prime Minister does not think it necessary to condemn it
 tippaniyan Rahul said, he (PM Modi) appreciates the Chief Ministers
 vah is baat ko puri tarah se najrandaaj karte hai ki hajaaron logon ke bhavishya ko unke mukhyamantri ne barbaad kar diya
 The Prime Minister completely ignored the business relationship between a criminal and his Chief Minister of Rajasthan
 darasal, monsoon satr ke shuru hone ke saath se hi congress sushamaa swaraj, shivaraj singh chouhan or vasundhara raaje ke istife kii maang kar rahi he

 uttar pradesh main samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (bispi) ke bich gathbandhan kaa elaan ho gaya he
 Both parties have not kept Congress in their camp
 haalanki do siten congress ke liye chodi gai hai lekin aadhikarik taur par congress ko sahyogi nahin banaaya gaya he
 What will be the final strategy of the Congress on this, it will be announced on Sunday
 lekin mana ja rahaa he ki congress upi main 'ekala chalo' matlab akele chalakar chunaav ladane kaa man bana rahi he
 On Saturday, after the seat-sharing formula was decided in the SP-BSP, Mayawati also made it clear that if the Congress stays in this camp, the SP-BSP would not have benefited from it
 congress kaa is par kya stand he, shanivaar ko party ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne koi tippanee nahin kii lekin itnaa jarur kaha ki ravivaar ko baqayada press conference kar party apni ranneeti bataaegi
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi also did not say anything openly on the alliance, but it definitely told that his party will contest elections in UP with 'full potential' and will stand firm on its stand
 shanivaar ko ek press conference main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki sapa-basapa ke prati unke man main kaaphi sammaan he or donon partiyaan apane manamafik faisle karne ke liye aaazaad hai
 Rahul said, 'BSP and SP have every right to combine

 Cabinet minister Rajendra Pratap Singh alias Moti Singh, the cabinet minister of the Yogi government, has made a controversial statement
 unhone kshetra kaa vikaas na karne vaale bhaajapa-apana dal vidhayakon or saansadon ke munh par kaalikh pot dene kaa janata se aahvaan kiya he
 BJP MLA and Cabinet Minister Rajendra Pratap Singh alias Moti Singh from Patti, in Prathapgarh market public meeting in Pratapgarh spoke to the public in question and said that they (MLA, MP) should develop Mangraura area

 It was only after the immense success of this show that Ekta Kapoor decided to remake the show
 2002 main uttar pradesh ke vidhansabha chunaav kii dugadugi baj chuki thi
 Yogi Adityanath, the young MP from Gorakhpur's assembly seat, is close to Dr
 radha mohan das agarwal ko ladaana the
 Yogi believed that the political equation of the Gorakhpur seat is in favor of Agarwal, so the victory will be difficult if the other gets the ticket
 magar, bijepi ne tikat de diya kalyaan singh or rajnath singh kii bijepi sarkaar main mantri rahe shiv pratap shukla ko
 Shukla was a four-time MLA, had been a cabinet minister three times
 apane kareebi ke liye purajor sifarish ke baad bhi tikat na milane se yogi adityanath party se khafa ho uthe
 Then they bet
 yah daanv tha radha mohan das agarwal ko akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha ke binar se bijepi ummidavaar shiv pratap shukla ke khilaaf chunaav maidan main utaarne kaa
 The impact of Yogi's base was that Shiv Pratap Shukla, who was a cabinet minister in the state government, slipped to the third position
 us chunaav main agarwal jahaan 38830 vot paakar jite, vahiin shukla sirf 14509 vot paakar tisare sthaan par rahe
 This was an occasion when a 31-year-old MP showed his strength to the party, unhappy with his demand
 unhone party ke aadhikarik ummidavaar ke hi khilaaf apana ummidavaar ladaaya bhi or jitayaa bhi
 At that time, in 2016, PM Modi not only sent Shiv Pratap Shukla, who lost the Rajya Sabha, but also ended the political exile by making him the Minister of State for Finance
 darasal, 2002 kii haar ke baad se hi shiv pratap shukla nepathy main chale gaye the
 That defeat left him on the political horizon of UP so marginalized that his political career was considered to be over
 kaha jaataa he ki baad main shiv pratap shukla se yogi ke rishte behatar hue to vah bhi modi sarkaar main unhen mantri banaae jane ke paksh main the
 Born on 5 June 1972 in Panchur village of Pauri district of Uttarakhand, several books have been written on Yogi Adityanath
 inhen main se ek kitaab bike chaturvedi ne bhi likhi he
 The name is Monk to Majesty: Biography of Yogi Adityanath
 is kitaab main 2002 ke vidhansabha chunaav main yogi ke is daanv-pech kaa ullekh he
 Chaturvedi mentions another incident as the hallmark of Yogi Adityanath's rebellion
 jab vah adwani se hi naaraaz hokar unki baithak main nahin pahunche the
 After which Advani himself met him
 yah naaraazgi tab thi, jab yogi adityanath ko adwani camp kaa hi mana jaataa rahaa
 Yogi's political career: Yogi Adityanath, who rose from the throne of the Mahant of the Math, to the chair of the Chief Minister of UP, is considered to be the discovery of Avaidyanath, the Mahant of the Gorakhnath Math
 aaj ke yogi kabhi uttarakhand ke ajay bisht the, jinaki pratibha ko avaidhyanath ne pahachaanaa or unke pita anand singh bisht se ek din kaha-apane chaar ladakon main se ek ladke ko hamen de dijie
 After this, Ajay Singh Bisht became Yogi Adityanath after taking retirement
 chunki gorakhnath math kaa sansadeey raajnneeti se gaharaa naata rahaa
 Hence Yogi became a politician along with the Mahant of the Math
 gorakhnath math ke sansadeey raajnneeti se judane ke itihaas kii baat karen to 1967 main math ke mahant digvijaynath hindu mahasabha ke tikat par gorakhpur ke saansad bane
 At the same time, his successor Mahant Avaidyanath was elected as an MLA continuously from Maniram assembly seat from 1962, 1967, 1974 and 1977
 1970 main avaidhyanath pehali baar saansad bane to phir 1989, 1991 or 1996 main bhi unhone jeet hasil kii
 After this, Avaidyanath announced Yogi Adityanath as his political successor and got a ticket from BJP at the age of just 26 years
 1998 main gorakhpur se loksabhaa chunaav jitkar 12 veen loksabhaa ke sabase kam umr ke saansad bane
 He also became MP for the fifth consecutive time in 2014
 iske baad 2017 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ko banpar safalataa mili to unhone march 2017 main party ne mukhyamantri banaaya
