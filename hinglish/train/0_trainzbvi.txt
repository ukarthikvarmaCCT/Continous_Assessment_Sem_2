 Her reaction :) melts my heart punjab ke faridakot main hatya kaa ek sansanikhej maamla saamne aayaa he, jahaan ek mahila ne premi ke saath milakar pati kii tejadhaar hathiyaar se hatya kar di or phir police ko chakma dene ke makasad se uski laash ko railway line par rakh diya
 The police solved this murder case after investigation
 katl kii yah vaardaat faridakot ke gaanv wandar jatana kii he
 Actually, the railway police got the news that a corpse was lying on the railway line near village Vander Jatana
 police maukey par pahunchi or laash ko kabje main lekar aas-paas chaanbin shuru kii
 Police noticed that blood was spilled at many places in the nearby fields
 police ko mauka-e-vaardaat par mili sabooton ke aadhaar par samajhate der nahin lagi ki maamla hatya kaa ho saktaa he
 Therefore investigation of the case was started from the angle of murder
 mritak kii shinaakht gaanv wandar jatana ke rahane vaale sukhdev singh ke taur par hui
 After this, the railway police informed the police station Sadar Kotkapura police
 thana police ne maamle kii jaanch ko aage badhaate hue mritak sukhdev kii patni jasvir cor samet kuch graminon ko hiraasat main lekar poochtacha kii
 During this time, the police suspected the deceased's wife Jasvir Kaur
 jab police ne usase sakhti se poochtacha kii to sara maamla khul gaya
 The police came to know that Jasveer Kaur, wife of the deceased Sukhdev, had conspired for the murder, due to his illicit relationship
 jasvir kaa harmanpreet singh naamak yuvak ke saath prem prasang chal rahaa tha, jisamen sukhdev roda bana hua tha
 Disturbed by this, Jasvir Kaur, along with her lover Harmanpreet, planned to kill Sukhdev
 jise amali jama pahanaate hue jasvir cor or harmanpreet ne sukhdev ko bahaane se ek khet main le jaakar tejadhaar hathiyaar se uski hatya kar di
 After the murder, the most important thing was to save yourself
 lihaaja jasvir or harmanpreet milakar sukhdev kii laash ko paas hi maujuud railway line tak le gaye or phir laash ko railway trek par rakh diya
 So that the case of suicide or getting cut off from the train
 lekin police kii jaanch main sara maamla khulkar saamne aa gaya
 Police registered a case of murder against Jasvir Kaur and her lover Harmanpreet
 un donon par saboot mitaane kii koshish kaa iljaam bhi he
 The police have arrested both
 piechdi kii chaatra ke saath chhedchhad ke maamle main saint stephens college ke praachaarya valsan thampoo ne sibiai jaanch kii maang karte hue kaha ki unke khilaaf peedita kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Forensic examination of the recording of 'alleged' conversations will clear everything
 thampoo ne kaha, 'mujhe peedita ke liye bura lag rahaa he
 He is being misled
 college ke hi kuch tatv mere khilaaf uskaa istemaal kar rahe hai
 He himself admitted in front of the media that on the advice of a 'teacher' he released a recording of the conversation
 'unhone kaha, 'use samaj nahin aa rahaa ki kuch log apane paroksh uddeshy puure karne ke liye use gumraah kar rahe hai
 Provoking him iskaa ant keval vidhwans hoga, kyonkiscchai chhipaai nahin ja sakati
 i believe that forensic examination of the tape will reveal the truth
 ' praachaarya ne haalanki un ‘kuch logon’ kii jaankaree nahin di
 Let us tell you that the complainant had complained to the police on 19 June accusing Satish Kumar, assistant professor in the chemistry department of the college
 usne kaha tha ki isisi ko maamle kii jaankaree dene parcolege ke praachaarya valsan thampoone aaropee ko bachaane kii koshish kii

 But there has been evidence of Pakistan being involved in the Uri and then Nagrota terror attacks, in such a situation that India will try to raise the issue of terrorism being spread across the border prominently during the conference

 The conference will be led by Pakistan's Prime Minister's Foreign Affairs Advisor Sartaj Aziz

 After the accident of the Unnao rape case victim and the question has started to arise whether it was just an accident
 jis trek ne car takkar main maari he uski number ko kaale rang se paint kar diya gaya tha
 The second accused driver who was caught is from Fatehpur
 kuldeep singh senger mularoop se isi jile ke rahane vaale hai vah unnav main apni nanihaal main based hue hai
 But one of the biggest fears is that the family of the victim has been given the security of 9 policemen from the government but they did not have any security personnel with them during the accident
 is par lakhanu ke ediji rajeev krishna kaa kahana he ki peedit parivaar ne surakshakarmiyon ko khud hi saath aane se manaa kar diya tha
 ADG Rajiv Krishna said, 'an accident has occurred in Rae Bareli district, two women have died and two are injured
 ham log behatar ilaaj kii vyavastha kar rahe he trek sij ho gaya he
 The driver has been caught
 trek ke number plate par paint ke bare main jaankaree nahin he
 His forensic examination will be conducted
 9 pulicekarmi suraksha main he wo kyon saath nahi the is par espi unnav ko jaanch ke aadesh die hai
 Although prima facie it has been learned that today he himself refused for the security personnel
 ' vahiin parijanon ke is durghatana ko sajeesh bataane ke sawaal par ediji ne kaha ki parivarijanon se baat karke is bare main koi jaankaree denge
 On this issue, Uttar Pradesh DGP OP Singh said in a conversation with News ANI that prima facie it seems to be a case of accident
 police is maamle main gambhirtha se jaanch kar rahi he
 The postmortem will be videographed
 jaanch ke liye team kaa gathan kiya gaya he
 Further, the DGP said that 10 policemen were given to the victim's family for protection
 jisamen 7 gord ghar main taiyaar kiye gaye the or teen guard 24 ghante inke saath rakhe gaye the jisamen 2 mahila or 1 purush guard he
 The DGP denied the lack of security saying that yesterday the victim's family was told to stay in the house as they have to take someone else on the way, so there was no security lapse
 unhone kaha ki parivaar kii ore se hatya kii koshish kii baat kahi ja rahi he agar peedit parivaar sibiai jaanch kii maang karegaa to ham taiyaar hai
 We have taken eyewitness statements and it seems that the speed of the truck was very high
 pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan apane saat divasiy daure ko puraa karne ke ek din baad commercial flite se pakistan ke liye ravaanaa hue
 In fact, a special aircraft given by Saudi Arabia had a technical breakdown just minutes after taking flight from New York's John F
 Kennedy International Airport (JFK)
 iske chalate imran khan or unke pratinidhimandal ko waapas neuyork lautnaa padaa tha
 After this, PM Imran Khan reached Jeddah by Saudi Airlines on Saturday afternoon, where after some time he left for Pakistan
 bataa den ki sanyukt raashtra mahasabha ke 74wein satr main bhaag lene ke baad america kii apni saat divasiy yatra puri karke piem imran khan ko shanivaar ko pakistan lautnaa tha, lekin JFK hawaii adde se udaan bharne ke kuch minuton baad hi unke vishesh vimaan main takneekee kharabi aa gai thi
 An attempt was made to correct the technical fault in the aircraft, but the technicians told PM Khan that the fault could not be rectified till the next morning
 iske baad piem khan saudi airlines kii flite se jedda ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye
 Meanwhile, Pakistan Ambassador Maliha Lodhi had also reached the airport after hearing the news of the technical malfunction in the flight of PM Imran Khan, but shortly after, he was sent back to the hotel, where he was sent to attend the UNGA
 Stayed during a week-long trip to America
 shuukravaar ko piem khan ne UNGA main apana pehla bhaashan diya tha, jo nirdhaarit samay se lagbhag 15 se 20 minute se adhik lanbaa tha
 The lawyer of the Sunni Waqf Board denied any letter, the lawyer of the board said, "someone must have sent at their level
 Another attempt is being made to resolve the letter Ram Janmabhoomi case with mutual consent
" is silsile main upi sunni vakf board or nirvaani akhaada ne ek baar phir madhyasthata kii maang kii he or supreme court kii ore se niyukt madhyasthata panel ke adhyaksh justise kaliphulla ko patr likhaa he
 According to the report, some of the Muslim parties believe that there is no harm in giving the Ram Janmabhoomi to the Hindus but after this the Hindus should not claim any other mosque or Idgah
 saath hi eesai ke kabje vaali sari masjiden niyamit namaaj ke liye khol di jaaen
 However, the Sunni Waqf Board lawyers are denying that a letter has been sent
 sunni vakf board ke vakil ne kaha he ki vakf board ke adhyaksh ne ho saktaa he ki apni personal capacity main kuch bheja ho saktaa he
 Lawyers say the arbitration panel has been dissolved once the hearing begins
 iske alaava, nirvaani akhaada jiskaa naam madhyasthata ke liye saamne aayaa he, maamle kaa pakshakaar nahin he
 It is in charge of Hanumangarhi temple
 board ke vakil ne kaha he ki ho saktaa he nirvaani akhaade ne ek "aradhak" ke rup main ek hastkshep yachika daayar kii gai ho lekin ram janmabhumi vivaad main ise aadhikarik pakshakaar nahin mana ja saktaa
 Muslim parties involved in the Ram temple dispute say that the UP Sunni Waqf Board is only one of the 6 Muslim parties and has written the letter without any consent and without authority
 duusare muslim pakshakaron kaa kahana he ki ek baar madhyasthata kii pahal samaapt ho jane ke baad kisi ko ye adhikaar nahi he ki madhyasthata phir se shuru karne ko kahe
 In such a situation, the new letter from the Sunni Waqf Board is baseless
 madhyasthata se nahin hua vivaad kaa nipatarabata den ki ramajanm bhoomi-babari masjid vivaad kaa adaalat se baahar samaadhaan nikaalane ke liye supreme court ne ek panel banaaya tha
 The names of Supreme Court Judge FM Kalifulla, Senior Advocate Sriram Panchu and spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar were named in it
 is panel ne is vivaad se jude pakshakaron se 155 dinon tak batkar maamle kaa samaadhaan nikaalane kii koshish kii, lekin isamen kamyaabi nahin mili
 Daily trial of the case began in the Supreme Court after an attempt to settle the arbitration failed
 philhal hindu paksh ne apni daleelein puri kar lee he or muslim paksh apni daleelein rakh rahaa he
 a constitution bench of five judges is hearing the case, with justices SA Bobde, DY Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S

 In the Southampton Test, England defeated Team India by 60 runs to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match Test series
 kohli ke alaava rahane ne bataur ballebaaj or sabhi gendbaajon ne bhi shandaar pradarshan kiya
 Former Indian captain and cricket veteran Sunil Gavaskar also lambasted the Indian team after this attack
 unhone kaha ki ab samay aa gaya he ki kuch khilaadiyon ko drop kiya jaae
 They should not only play 11 but they should be eliminated from the whole squad
 
 
 
 And after a dream defeat, the Indian team's dream of winning the Test series on the soil of England was also broken

 This means that it is a mixed form of both
 9 november ko milegi nijatadow mahapatra ne bataaya kii fog yaa smog kii condishan jo develop hoti he, iske kai kaaran hote hai
 The reason for the weather that has been there for the last 2 days is that an anti-cyclonic circulation remains at a lower level
 unhone kaha ki jab koi anti cychlonic cirkulation nichle str par hota he to upar se neeche hawa baithti he
 This does not reduce the pollution of the lower level
 unhone kaha, hamen ummid he ki 9 taarikh se yah system kamjor pad jayega or maujuuda sthiti se mukti milegi

 He claimed to provide housing to the people like no government has built a house in the last 45 years
 ’ Describing the Sadbhavna Mission as a drama, Keshubhai said that Modi's new goodwill is not for the common people, otherwise the word would have gone to the ears of the people even in 2002

 After the bjpkram Mandirrag before the Lok Sabha elections due next year, now Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav has announced the construction of a grand temple of Lord Vishnu
 uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki bhagwaan vishnu kaa nagar viksit kiya jayega, jisamen bhavy mandir hoga or yah mandir cambodia ke angakorwat mandir kii hi tarah hoga
 a temple like Angkor Wat Akhilesh told the agency language, 'we will develop a city on the land of more than 2,000 acres in the name of Lord Vishnu, close to Lion Safari of Etawah
 hamaare paas chambal ke bihadon main kaaphi bhoomi he
 The city will have a grand temple of Lord Vishnu
 yah mandir cambodia ke angakorwat mandir kii hi tarah hoga
 'former Chief Minister Akhilesh's statement comes at a time when Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya has once again raised the issue of Ram temple before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 maury ne sanket die the ki sansad ke jariye kanoon banaakar ayodhya main ram mandir kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 However, this issue is currently pending in the Supreme Court
 ram mandir mudde par sidhaa jawaab dene se bachate hue akhilesh ne vaada kiya ki agar ve satta main aae to bhagwaan vishnu kaa ek nagar nishchit taur par viksit kiya jayega
 He said that Lord Rama and Lord Krishna are both incarnations of Vishnu
 adhyayan ke liye visheshgyon kii team cambodia bheji jaaegi
 BJP fooled, targeting the BJP, Akhilesh called it a party of conspirators who do nothing at the ground level and fools the public to vote
 akhilesh upi main chunaav haraane ke baad kai baar pehle bhi kah chuke hai ki bijepi ne janata ko gaay or gobar ke naam par bevakoof banaakar unka vot hasil kiya he
 The politics of Ram temple is already going on in Uttar Pradesh, in such a situation, the statement of construction of Vishnu temple by Akhilesh Yadav can give a new twist to the politics of the state
 unke is bayaan se jaahir he ki vah bijepi par usee ko tir se nishaanaa sadhate chaahate hai
 During the election campaign for this phase, the Prime Minister addressed about 14 rallies while Rahul spent more than seven days in Saurashtra and South Gujarat and addressed several meetings

 Through his Tantar Mantar and Anubhuti tells the village where water will be found by digging

 Vadra, who has been living behind the scenes for the past 15 years and occasionally looks like a shadow, did not hesitate to come out in the open
 wadra 1999 se parivaar ke saath chunaav prachaar par nikalate rahe hai, lekin aisa pehali baar hua ki raibareli ke is van main sho main ve apane donon bacchon, 11 varshiya rehaan or 9 varshiya miraya ko lekar aae the

 raibareli ke sthaneey congressi netaaon ne wadra main aae fark ko mahasoos bhi kiya he
 Kalyan Singh Gandhi, 42, a Congress leader who has been working for the Gandhi family for the last two decades, said that Vadra wanted to do something effective in this election and demanded an event that would match his personality
 kalyaan ne india today ko bataaya, ''isiilie maine unke liye raibareli kii surakshit seat salon main bike raily kaa aayojan kiya

 During this, Vadra also got involved in controversies over the violation of the model code of conduct when his convoy was stopped by District Election Officer Pawan Sen

 Since marriage, Vadra's business has grown wildly
 unke pita rajinder wadra muradabad main pital ke saamaan ke niryaat kaa dhandha chalaate the
 Robert Vadra started the handicrafts and fashion merchandise business in 1997 under the name of Artex
 usee saal unki shaadi hui thi
 In a 2010 interview to a newspaper, he told how he used to go astray to sell his goods, "it is not so easy to build a business
" main apane saplir khojane ke liye puraani dilli kii galiyon or chaavdi bazaar main bhatka karata tha
 With my sample, i traveled around the world and went around looking for buyers
 kai baar mujhe niraashaa haath lagi, lekin maine haar nahin maani
 And today we are very successful
 tab se lekar aaj tak ham kaaphi lambii duuri tay kar chuke hai
 Vadra's golden tale, which started with brass, is no longer a hidden thing
 march, 2011 main ek bijness akhbaar ne real estate ke kaarobaar main unke ''chupchaap or abaadhit pravesh'' par vistaar se likhaa tha, jisamen ek saajhedaari or desh kii sabase badi realty form dlef ke saath unki saajhedaari or len-dein kii bhi baat thi
 According to the newspaper, in 2007, Vadra started trying another business and bought a lot of land in Haryana and Rajasthan
 iske alaava dilli ke ek hotel main aadhi hissedari kharid lee or chartered vimaanon ke dhandhe main bhi haath aajamaaya
 Many of his companies have taken loans and many of these loans have been given by DLF without pledge
 wadra ne is akhabaari report par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki dlef ke saath unka rishta uske maalik ke saath puraane paariwarik sambandh ke chalate he
 He said, "I have known the people of DLF for a long time and they are my friends
 main real estate main nivesh karnaa chahta tha or is sambandh ne meri madad kii
 However, it took a lot of effort to prove that they are running their own business on their own
 dlef ne daawa kiya tha ki ''dlef samooh kaa wadra ke saath kaarobaari sambandh unke ek swatantra udhyami hone kii haisiyat se hi hai or ye puri tarah paardarshee hai
 "so far, the expanding empire of Vadra is avoiding public scrutiny because they have done all this on a private level
 yadi ve vidhayika main kisi pad ke liye daawa karte hai, to unhen yah suvidha chhodani padegi
 However, Vadra returned to Delhi with Priyanka on the evening of 6 February after a sensational tour in Rae Bareli
 priyanka 9 pha ravari ko dobaaraa prachaar par nikal gayi, lekin wadra kii yojanaon ke bare main koi khabar nahin he
 If sources are to be believed, the Congress is trying to find ways to rein in the son-in-law
 congress ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''unhone rahul ko limlite se baahar kar diya
 If this loss is not repaid, then whatever benefit the Congress has got due to Rahul's efforts, all will be found in the soil
 ''uttar pradesh main mritpraaya congress main rahul gandhi ne kuch jaan foonki thi, lekin wadra ke karname ne party ko baikfoot par laa diya he
 The central leadership of the Congress is also unable to decide how to deal with Vadra; It is evident that as soon as the marriage is married, the relationship is fragile
 sawaal kai hai, masalan kya wadra ko sonia gandhi se ijaajat mili hui he? kya ve apni patni par dabaav daal rahe hai?is masale par party kii aadhikarik line mahasachiv janardan dvivedi or pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne saamne rakhi
 Singhvi said, "people have taken Vadra's statement in a different context
 apane pati kii rajnatik mahatvakanksha par priyanka gandhi ke bayaan ke baad mujhe kuch nahin kahana he
 He did not say anything about Vadra's statement after cleaning Priyanka

 He is protected by the Special Protection Group due to his marriage to Priyanka, so he walks in his own style - a pilot gypsy runs in front of his car, which consists of five commandos of the Delhi Police
 uske peeche ek or gypsy chalati he
 Vadra bought five top end bikes in 2011 — Hayabusa, harley-davidson and Ducati — though the friendly days of riding on these with his brother-in-law Rahul Gandhi are over
 wadra kabhi bhi surkhiyon se zyada dur nahin rahe
 His life has always been surrounded by some controversy

 If Sonia Gandhi leaves this seat due to health reasons, the party will want Priyanka to be the candidate from here
 unke kaarobaari rishton ke bare main chhapane vaale akhbaar ko unhone pichley saal bataaya tha, ''main apane parivaar se koi bhi phayda uthaane kii koshish nahin karata

 He openly says that he wants to go to Rio and make a world record for the 7th consecutive Olympics
 ye kuch aisi baaten hai jisase tennis fans acchhee tarah vaakif hai
 Paes also stands out because of his fans and his dealings with journalists

 The great thing is that during this time they meet all the reporters who came to the press conference in private

 His critics may say that he may be in need at the moment, so he is doing so
 lekin pes kaa ye vyahaar sabhi press conference main rahata he
 In a short time they try to identify journalists as if they have known them for years
 wo sabko pahachaanakar unke naam se pukaarane kii koshish karte hai
 The comments khaas baat ye he ki is dauraan wo jor dekar apane saport staff, apane piaar manager or jo bhi unki team kaa hissaa rahe hai unke naamon kaa zikr zarur karte hai
 After the press conference in Delhi, he won the hearts of all by hanging photos with all the staff of Hotel Lalit

 Can we all take a photo together? ”kapil and a hotel waiter have long waited for this moment

 After winning his 18th French Open title at Rolland Garros, Paes celebrated his success by holding a press conference in the capital Delhi

 He knows that he has made his day by being photographed with Pace's trophy

 In the relationship with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Shiv Sena's tautness has now come to the fore, and the party has directly targeted the Sangh Pramukh, the Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat, through its mouthpiece 'saamana'
 'saamana' ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa he, "sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne puraane or dakiyanoosee vichaar ko nae rup main prastut kiya

 If Hindus give birth to more children, then the people already living in trouble will be troubled by the problem of unemployment, hunger, inflation

 The Supreme Court has stayed the High Court verdict in the case of gang rape of a student at Jindal Global University
 supreme court ne peedit kii arji par aaropee chaatro ko notice jari kar jawaab maanga he
 In September this year, the Punjab and Haryana High Court suspended the sentence of three law students of Jindal Global Law School
 unhen do saal pehle uniwarsity main hi padhne vaali chaatra ko blackmel karne or gangrape rape karne ke maamle main doshi tehraaya gaya tha
 The Additional District and Sessions Court sentenced the main accused Hardik Sikri and his friend Karan Chhabra to 20 years while Vikas Garg was sentenced to seven years
 teenon ne hoicourt se apil lambit hone kii vajah se jamaanat par reeha karne kii maang kii thi
 Approving his plea, the High Court suspended his conviction and bet that the three countries would not leave during this time
 chaatra se kisi bhi tarah sampark karne kii koshish nahin karenge or apana drishyratik pravritiyon ke bane rahane tak manochikitsak se counselling karaayenge
 The parents of the three have been instructed to file a report in the court after six months on this issue
 hai court ne faisla sunaate hue kaha ki wo peedit kii chintaa, samaaj kii maang or kanoon or sudharatmak evam punarvaas nyaay ke bich balance bananaa chaahate hai
 It would be a joke to keep the young minds imprisoned for a long time which would deprive them of education, opportunities to free themselves and to be a part of society in a normal way
 tippaniyan The Bench held that incarceration for a long period of time could cause irreparable damage to them as the appeal would be pending for some time
 hamaari raay main jab tak ye apil lambit rahegi, duusare aparaadh kii sambhaavna main unke man main dar rahegaa ki agar apil fail ho gai to unhen lambii kaid hogi
 Not only this, the bench even said that it is the 'casual' behavior of the victim towards violence which is the binding reason for the suspension of the sentence
 peedit ke bayanon main kahin bhi yon aparaadhon main parichiton ke saath saamaanya vyavhaar, dussahas or prayog koi anya pahalu nahin aayaa or isi kaaran ye tathy sajaa ko nilambit karne ke badhyakaari kaaran hai wo bhi tab aaropee yuva hai or peedita ne hinsa ke prati apriy vyavhaar nahin dikhaaya or wo saamaanya tareeke se ghatnaon ke saath chalati rahi
 The bench also said that this incident is a reflection of the young minds' dangerous thinking of drugs, alcohol and general sexual adventurism and is a confused and voyeuristic world
 aadesh main peedit ke bayanon ke aadhaar par kaha gaya he ki yuvaaon kii aparipakv lekin napak duniya main jane or jhaankne kii jarurat he jahaan yuvaaon ko sammaan or aapasi samaj par aadhaarit rishtein kii keemat kaa ahsaas nahin he
 The trio had sought release on bail as the appeal was pending with the High Court
 unki arji ko manjuur karte hue hoicourt ne unki sazaa nilambit kar di ore shart laga di ki is dauraan teenon desh chhodkar nahin jaaenge
 i will not try to contact the student in any way and will consult a psychiatrist till his voyeuristic tendencies persist
 teenon ke abhibhavakon ko nirdesh diya gaya he ki is mudde par wo chah maheene baad court main report daakhil karenge
 The High Court, while giving the verdict, said that they want to strike a balance between the concern of the victim, the demand of society and law and corrective and rehabilitation justice
 ye ek majaak hoga ki yuva man ko lambey vakt tak jail main kaid rakhaa jaae jo unhen shiksha, khud ke mukt hone ke maukey or saamaanya tareeke se samaaj hissaa banane se vanchit karegaa
 The comments bench ne kaha ki lambey vakt tak kaid main rakhana unke liye apoorniy kshati ho sakati he kyonki apil kuch samay tak lambit rahegi
 In our opinion, as long as this appeal is pending, in the possibility of another crime, they fear that if the appeal fails, they will be imprisoned for a long time
 itnaa hi nahin bench ne ye tak kaha ki ye peedit kaa hinsa ke prati ‘ cajual’ vyavhaar he jo sajaa nilamban ke badhyakaari kaaran hai
 Nowhere in the victim's statements did any other aspect of normal behavior, adventurousness and experimentation with acquaintances in sexual offenses come to pass and these facts are the compelling reasons for suspending the conviction, even then the accused are young and the victim has made unpleasant behavior towards violence
 She did not show up and kept up with the events in the usual way
 bench ne ye bhi kaha ki ye ghatana yuva man kii drugs, sharaab or saamaanya yon dussahas ke khatarnaak soch kii pratibimb he or ye ek bhramit va drishyratik duniya he
 The order said on the basis of the victim's statements that the youth need to go and peep into the immature but nefarious world where the youth do not realize the value of the relationship based on respect and mutual understanding

 panun kashmir (pike) ke adhyaksh ashvini kumaar shrungu ne kaha ki vaartakaron ne jo kuch bhi vichaar rakhe, ve kashmir maamle main puure desh kii bhaawanaaon se alag hai
 He said that one of the interlocutors, Dilip Padgaonkar, termed the Kashmir case as a 'controversy', which cannot be accepted in any way

 The BJP won a total of 49 assembly seats in 2013 led by Raman Singh
 jabaki congress sirf 39 siten hi jeet pai thi
 While 2 seats went to others
 2008 ke mukaable bijepi ko teen siten kam mili thim, iske baavjood unhone purna bahumat se apni sarkaar banaai

 sabhi dharmon ke saamaanya varg ke garib nagarikon ko 10 fisadi aarakshan dene ke liye samvidhan main laayaa gaya sanshodhan bill loksabhaa main paas ho gaya he
 a total of 326 mps voted on the bill in the Lok Sabha, of which 323 supported the amendment, while 3 mps opposed the bill
 yani savarnon ko aarakshan dene vaala sanshodhan bill loksabhaa main upasthit sadasyon ke do-tihaai se zyada bahumat se paas ho gaya
 Now this bill will be introduced in Rajya Sabha
 sarkaar kaa maananaa he ki samvidhan main sanshodhan kiye jane se is faisle ko supreme court main chunauti dena aasaan nahin hoga
 While some opposition parties are claiming this order to be rejected in the Supreme Court, the government hopes that the court will reject those who go against this law
 lekin modi sarkaar ke is faisle ke siyaasi myne bhi nikaale ja rahe hai
 Such questions are also arising as to why it was brought in the last days of the last session of the Parliament? The upper caste reservation and political equations BJP won 256 seats from 14 states out of 282 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 in 14 rajyon main loksabhaa kii 341 siten hai, jinamein se kareeb 180 siton par savarna voter nirnaayak hai
 Nearly 25 seats in Maharashtra, 5-5 seats in Haryana, Delhi and Uttarakhand, 4 seats in Himachal are upper caste voters
 baat gujarat kii karen to yahaan 12, empi kii 14, rajasthan kii 14, bihar kii kareeb 20 seat or jharkhand kii 6 seat par iskaa asar padataa he
 There are 35 to 40 seats in UP alone, where upper caste voters decide someone's victory or defeat
 aise main 2019 ke aam chunaav se thik pehle modi sarkaar kaa yah masterstroke vipakshi ekajutata ke liye hanikaarak bhi sabit ho saktaa he or bijepi kii vijayi rath ko phir se parwaaj mil sakati he
 Who, how much reservation, among all this, understand that what is the status of those who have got reservation so far in the country and how many people will get the benefit of this if the new reservation policy is implemented
 desh main 16
 6% is Scheduled Caste (SC) population, which gets 15% reservation
 jabaki 8
 6% of the Scheduled Tribes (ST) population is called 7
 5 fisadi aarakshan miltaa he
 The country has about 41% Other Backward Classes (OBC) population, which gets 27% reservation
 inke alaava kareeb 34 fisadi log wo hai, jo saamaanya shrenee main aate hai or philhal aarakshan kii vyavastha se baahar hai or modi sarkaar aise hi saamaanya shrenee vaale garibon ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan laa rahi he, jinhen abhi tak koi phayda nahin miltaa he
 That is, if this decision of the Modi government is implemented, there will be a large section of the country benefiting from it
 dilachasp baat ye he ki modi sarkaar ne dharm or jati kii simaaon ko todate hue phayda pahunchane kaa faisla liya, jo chunavi drushtikon se mile kaa pathar sabit ho saktaa he
 The system of reservation for the economically backward was formed, the system of reservation in the country has been in place since independence
 anusuchit jati or anusuchit janajati ke liye aarakshan kii vyavastha ke baad 1990 main anya pichhadaa varg ko aarakshan diya gaya
 After this, efforts started to identify the economically backward society and to give it the benefit of reservation
 isi ke tahat july 2006 main major general ritred esaaar sinha kii adhyakshata main EBC kamishan banaaya gaya
 Its task was to identify the EBC i
e
 economically backward class and make recommendations based on their condition
 esaaar sinha kamishan ne 2010 main di apni report main aarthik rup se kamjor varg ke bare main jaankaree di
 Sinha Commission Report
 
 
 
 The upper castes, who are unable to earn even till filling the tax, should be treated like obcs
 -5 se 6 karod log aise hai, jinhen SC-ST ke jaise aarakshan milanaa chahie
 - The Commission in its report made 14 recommendations including reservation to this class
 -khaas taur par savarna jatiyon ke liye naukari-college main aarakshan dene kii sifarish thi
 The economically weaker section who do not have reservation is about 17% of the population
 -aarthik pichhadon main 18 fisadi aise hai, jo garibi rekha se neeche hai
 - Around 6% of the people of the upper castes do not have any land
 -kareeb 65 fisadi aise log hai, jinke paas ek hectares se bhi kam zamin he
 According to the report, Dalits and Adivasis have a similar upper caste population, which is below the poverty line
 aise main agar in aankadon ke hisaab se dekha jaae modi sarkaar kaa yah faisla desh ke ek bade tabake ko saadhane main sahyog kar saktaa he, jo 2019 chunaav ke maddenjar kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he

 jab usne jor diya, to adhikari ne use giraftaar kar liya or uske upar hathi ke ek bachche ko maarane kaa aarope madh diya

 This sensational case of murder is from Beed district

 His brother, along with his comrades, attacked Sumit with a sharp-edged weapon

 If we have learned anything in recent years in terms of leadership, it is that intellectualism is given more importance and determination is less important
 netaaon ko chunate samay ham swaabhaavik taur par unke kaamkaaj se zyada unke vichaaron ke prati jhukaav rakhte hai jabaki itihaas ne hamen yah sabak diya he ki mahaan netaa ve hue hai jinhone achche kaam kiye, na ki ve jo achche vichaarak the
 The qualities of determination, purpose and perseverance are always found in the best leaders, they have helped change the world
 oxford se piechdi kii degree ke saath hamaare pichley pradhanmantri sambhawatah sabase zyada bauddhik or academik uplabdhiyaan hasil karne vaale netaa the
 But they failed
 desh main ghat rahi ghatnaon ko roak paane kii na to unke paas prabhavi ichhashakti thi or na hi apane vichaaron ko kaaryrup de paane kii kshamta
 Fueled by the recently sluggish moves and paralyzed government, the Indian voter has now chosen a completely different kind of leader
 narendra modi main uddeshy kii samaj to he hi, kaam ke baaki byoron par bhi dhyaan dena unki khubi he
 Tremendous power and determination from above
 chizon ko kaaryrup de sakane vaale kisi shaks main ye anivaary yogyataayen hoti hai
 Such a person knows how to get things on the right track

 There is a need to implement the old ideas and old laws better, not new ideas and new laws to solve India's problems
 modi ne pichley saal hamen is sachaai kii kai baar yaad dilaai
 Those who know him well also say that Modi's strength is in executing things
 is baar hamen desh ke liye aisa agxcutive incharge mila he jo nattejey laane main sakasham he
 For this reason, a liberal, secular person like me who has no attraction in Hindutva or BJP, also voted for Modi

 "often, foreigners remind us that the Indian people are talented, but quite humbly add that they seem" smarter than they are "
 bhartiya sochate or tark-vitark bahut zyada karte hai, bahut saare pahaluon ko dekhte hai, par kaam nahin karte
 Because of this it becomes difficult to recruit talented people because we do good interviews, but how will we decide how many of them are working and how many are just talking? In Indian life, the gap between just thinking and working is so deep that many times i feel hopeless that weak implementation is our character flaw
 manager or baad main board ke sadsy yaa kansaltent ke rup main kaam karne ke apane anubhavon se main is baat kii pushti kar saktaa hum ki zyaadaatar manager aam taur par ranneeti acchhee taiyaar kar lete hai, lekin ve ise lagu karne main kamjor sabit hote hai

 gujarat ke chote-se kasbe main railway plateform par chaay bechney se lekar 7, rescorse road tak pahunchane tak kii narendra modi kii kahani unke netritv kii style ke saath hi kai or chizon ko darshaati he
 If you look at the story of moving forward in his life with increasing responsibilities in RSS and later in Gujarat government, Modi was not satisfied with just making comprehensive policies
 pichley pradhanmantriyon kii tarah ve kriyanvayan kii jimmedaari apane neeche vaale logon ko saunpkar santusht rahane vaale nahin
 They carry with them people who have the same ability to execute, set clear and fixable goals, and create small teams of "implementation"
 ranneeti kii ghoshnaa karne kii jagah ve kisi project kaa samoochaa vivaran hasil karte hai, uske din-prati-din ke pradarshan kii nigaraanee karte hai, jo log ise kriyanvit kar rahe hai, unke raste kii adchanon ko dur karte hai, unke saath khadey rahete hai or unhen prerit karte rahete hai
 They value people who take initiative, take risks and punish those who want to work safely and behave like bureaucrats
 saath hi, ve yah sab aisi khubi se karte hai ki kahin se bhi yah na lage ki chizon main dakhal de rahe hai yaa bahut baarik-prabandhan main lage hai
 Therefore, he has been able to get very extraordinary things done even to a simple Gujarati
 maine narendra modi kaa bhaashan pehali baar farvari, 2013 main dilli ke shriram college of commers main suna tha or isse unki tamaam kshamtaaon kii jaankaree hasil hui
 This was his first speech as part of a long campaign for the Prime Minister and in which he correctly declared his ambition
 sankochi rahul gandhi or congress party ke vipareet modi ne saaf taur se yah sandesh diya ki ve yah pad paane ko utsuk hai
 His clarity of purpose was a new thing for the Indian electorate
 modi apane is khaas lakshya ko lekar bhi ekadam saaf the ki bijepi ko purna bahumat dilaanaa he
 Every time he talked about it, people in social media used to make him laugh, many people thought that he was crazy
 ve yah nahin jaanate the ki asambhav mahatvakankshaon ne hi kai safal netritv ko aage badhaayaa he
 Managers consider it a "stretched" target and their aim is to keep the troops around the difficult target
 asambhav lakshya un sainikon ko prerit karne kaa tarika hota he jo apni alag quality yani bhinnata ko bhul chuke hote hai
 They feel that they have "their" goals and battles
 is prakaar karishmai netaa apane sahyogiyon main uddeshy kaa ascharyajanak sarhpan hasil karne ke liye jane jate hai-jise bijness manager ‘‘allinement’’ kehete hai
 Great leaders are not good people
 i noticed another feature in Narendra Modi's campaign - the importance of a united team
 mahaan netaa aise ‘‘bhale’’ log nahin hote jinhen lokapriyata hasil ho or nishchit rup se aise vyakti nahin hote jinhen aap ek bhadra dinar party main bula saken
 Narendra Modi had to ensure that the command was unified and he had to get rid of opponents and skeptics
 isse yah samajha ja saktaa he ki aakhir kyon unhen laalkrishna adwani, jaswant singh or kai duusare netaaon ko haashie par dhakelnaa padaa
 After all, why did he send his most trusted warlord Amit Shah to perform a miracle of changing the picture in Uttar Pradesh, and why despite opposition from within the party, he went b

 Dislikes like Yeddyurappa and Ram Vilas Paswan kept tainted leaders with them
 agxcutive shabd kaa matlab he ‘‘jo agjicute kare’’ yani kaam ko kriyanvit kare
 The hallmark of an effective executive is to do good planning and pay attention to details
 maine procter and gambal main yah ahm sabak siikhaa he
 (second lesson is how to write a short memo of one page because you will not get another page to write)
 jaisaa maine pehle kaha he, modi chizon ko kriyanvit karne vaale hai, isliye planning or vivaran unhen swatah hi mil jaataa he
 We have seen on TV that he is a brilliant speaker, but behind the scenes has brought months of planning to the dozens of activists who worked with discipline every minute of preparation
 antat yah kaha ja saktaa he ki modi ham sab jaise hi shaks hai jinke andar kamiyaan hai
 Had i been in his place, i would have regretted the events of 2002 at least a dozen times, without risking my own course
 main apane paas taqatvar think tanks rakhata jo mujhe khaskar aarthik or videshi niti ke masalon par aankade muhaiyaa karaae

 Sam Pitroda said that he does not believe in this theory
 unhone kaha ki mumbai hamale ke baad humlog bhi pakistan plane bhej sakate the, lekin aisa karnaa sahi nahin tha
 He said that he would really like to know what the Indian army did in Balakot, did we really kill 300 people? Opposition insults our forces time and again

 piem ne kaha ki ram gopal yadav kaa bayaan un sabhi logon kaa apmaan he jo kashmir kii raksha karte hue shahid ho gaye hai, ye hamaare shaheedon ke pariwaron ko dukhi karata he

 dilli kii jitani sardi mashhoor he, utani hi garmi bhi lekin is saal garmi ke mausam main dilli main mataka main bhi kaaphi mashhoor ho rahaa he
 The story of this Matka man, who lumps thirsty throats with 700 liters of water in his Matka van on the streets of South Delhi, is very interesting
 jisadillimein tapati garmi main pyaas bujhane ke liye bhi logon ko pani kharid kar pinaa padataa he, usee dilli main mataka main logon ko muft pani pilaane kaa kaam karata he
 According to Matka Man, this work is not just social work but also their responsibility towards humanity
 south dilli ke posh colony panchasheel park kii shandaar kothi main rahane vaale 68 saal ke 'alag natarajan’ ab matakaman ke naam se jane jate hai
 The view outside their house is different from others
 sirf ghar nahin balki mataka main kii dincharya bhi aaleeshaan kothiyon main rahane vaale logon se bilkul alag he
 Wake up at around 5 am every day to fill the water tank in your Matka van car and then get out to fill about 70 Metals of South Delhi
 mataka main kii jindagi kaa makasad hi ab maanav seva he
 How did 'matka Man' become an IIT professional Natarajan? Matka Man, who has become his messiah for the needy people, worked as an engineer in London for about 32 years
 2004 main unhen pataa chalaa tha ki unhen malashay kaa cancer he
 Cancer was known at the time and treatment was done on time but this incident completely changed the thinking and Matka Man returned to India in 2005 with his family
 ritair hone ke baad alag natarajan ne kai enjio ke saath bhi kaam kiya lekin unki soch ngo's kii soch se alag thi or phir unhen edia aayaa IIT, green park, panchasheel or chiraag dilli jaisi jagahon par pani ke matake rakhane kaa or iske liye natarajan ne apane ejeeniyar dimag kaa istemaal karke vine ko modiphai kiya
 Matka Man stores around 700 liters of water in the van
 pani kii vestage rokane ke liye bottle se bharne vaale logon ke liye vine main alag nal kii bhi vyavastha he
 At first, Natarajan used to fill water from his house, but the number of mats started increasing and when the water started coming down, one of his neighbors extended a helping hand
 ab natarajan ko paas hi ke do skool bhi pani dete hai
 Everyday those who see Natarajan filling water in the mats, they help those who do not know, they also give many blessings
 pyaas bujhane vaale mataka main jaruratmandon kii madad bhi karte hankehate he pani pilaanaa punya kaa kaam he, lekin mataka main sirf pani nahin pilaate balki logon kii jaruraton ko puraa karne kii bhi koshish karte hai
 Natarajan is not only giving water to the thirsty water, but where he has kept water pots, he has also installed a pump to fill the bicycle tires so that cyclists or rickshaw drivers are not disturbed
 natarajan apni vine lekar rojaanaa subah south dilli ke 7 jagahon par matakon ko bharne kaa kaam karte hai lekin jis jagah par natarajan ko seva karne kaa sabase zyada anand miltaa he wo he masjid moth kaa fliover, jiske neeche police booth ke kareeb na sirf pani ke matake rakhe hue hai balki natarajan kii team jinaki saikil main ghanti nahin hoti, unki saikil par ghanti laga dete hai jisase accident kam hon or ye seva bhi nishulk he
 In the summer, when thirst is throbbing and you get cold water from the pot, it is not less than any nectar, but Natarajan's van releases not only water but also lassi
 logon kii maane to kabhi khire, kabhi tarbooz to kabhi neembu pani bhi mataka main logon main nishulk baantate hai
 To support him in this noble cause of different Natarajan, there are four more people who make lassi-sharing, ringing bells
 natarajan ko is kaam main patni kaa puraa sahyog miltaa he
 There is no dearth of admirers of Natarajan's sense of service
 jo log mataka main ko rojaanaa logon kii madad karte dekhte hai wo duaon ke saath ummid bhi karte hai ki natarajan ki tarah kuch or log bhi maanavtaa ke liye aage aae

 ghatana ke baad raakhi mongolpuri police thane gayi or shikaayat darj karai
 Soon after the incident, when reporters asked Rakhi if she would take security, she said that she would not take any police protection
 raakhi ne kaha, 'main koi suraksha nahin luungi
 This is a decision based on our principle
 main dari-sahami nahin hum
 i will continue to work for the welfare of the people
 'unhone kaha, 'hamaari party kii netaa santosh coli ne samaaj ke liye apni jaan de di
 We are committed to serving the people

 As promised by his party to implement simplicity, Arvind Kejriwal himself has been refusing to take any kind of protection

 Significantly, the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, Rakhi Birla, has been out on the streets for the last few days, taking stock of the arrangements for the night shelters
 unhone kai maukon par laaparvaah adhikariyon va karmchaariyon ke khilaaf karrwai kii baat bhi kahi he

 Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal came to the media for the first time after surgery and as soon as he came, he accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of a conspiracy
 anti karpshan branch kii exiaar kii copy laharaate hue kejariwal ne bataaya ki dilli mahila ayog main 85 logon kii niyuktiyon ke maamle main unhen swati maliwal ke saath sah aaropee banaaya gaya he
 Arvind Kejriwal, targeting his prime minister, said, 'why is my name in the FIR? If the name of the Chief Minister has come up, it would have been discussed at a large level
 yahpradhanmantri narendra modike ishaare par hua hoga
 This should be discussed in detail
 'kejariwal ne kaha, 'exiaar main meri bhoomika ke bare main kahin koi zikr nahin kiya gaya he

 Meanwhile, ACB Chief MK Meena made it clear that Arvind Kejriwal is an accused in the FIR, but nothing was found against him in the preliminary inquiry

 Stung by this statement, the deputy CM once again came to speak to the media outside the CM house

 Further, Sisodia alleged a deep conspiracy against the CM and said that efforts were being made to destabilize the Delhi government and the whole list was coming from the Prime Minister's office
 jaahir haiaam aadmi partypane mukhiya arvind kejariwal par koi daag nahin lagane dena chaahati he
 This was the main reason that when the portfolios were divided in the Delhi government, Kejriwal kept himself free from all responsibilities so as to avoid getting caught in any matter or dispute

 The Shiv Sena has said that the government's Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar threatening the President's rule is an insult to the mandate
 saamana main likhaa, 'maharashtra kii raajnneeti philhal ek mjedaar shobhaayatra ban gai he
 If Shivrai has such a fun procession in Maharashtra, who will be responsible for it? The current mess is not 'shivshahi'
 rajya kii sarkaar to nahin lekin vidaa hoti sarkaar ke buje hue jugnu roj nae majaak karke maharashtra ko kathinaayee main daal rahe hai
 The government's Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar has given up the shout of a new threat, saying goodbye to some result of bullying and coercion by investigating agencies
 7 november tak satta kaa pench hal na hone par maharashtra main raashtrapati shashan laga diya jayega
 'further wrote,' What poison is boiling in the mind of Mr
 Mungantiwar and his party, it can be understood from this statement
 kanoon or samvidhan kaa abhyaas kam ho to ye hota hi he yaa kanoon or samvidhan ko dabaakar jo chahie wo karne kii niti iske peeche ho sakati he
 One is if the President is in our grasp or the rubber stamp bearing the President's seal is kept in the BJP office of the state and if our rule does not come, then the people can understand the meaning of this threat by using the stamp to invoke the Emergency of President's rule in Maharashtra
 ? 'shiv Sena wrote,' Sudhir Mungantiwar's threat of President's rule is anti-democracy and unconstitutional
 ye maharashtra or vidhansabha chunaav main mili janadesh kaa apmaan he
 Ramdas Athawale living in a house called ‘constitution’ Dr
 ambedkar ke samvidhan kaa apmaan sahan na karen
 'it is written in Saamana,' the question is why the government is not being formed in Maharashtra, who will give the reason for this? Should the people of Maharashtra be held responsible for the announcement of the BJP becoming the Chief Minister again, and would not have presented the claim of forming the government? And if there is no government, Mughalia threatens to impose President's rule

 input:pti The Chandigarh Lok Sabha constituency has become a hot seat for the leaders of Punjab Congress at this time, on which the process of putting their claim to contest elections is increasing
 sabase pehle hi punjab congress kii varisht netaa or punjab cabinet ke mantri navjot singh siddhu kii patni navjot cor siddhu ne chandigarh loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladane ke liye apana daawa thok diya he, jisase punjab or chandigarh kii raajnneeti main halchal much gai he
 Navjot Kaur reached Congress Bhavan in Chandigarh on Friday evening and applied for a Congress ticket to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Chandigarh, in writing to Chandigarh Congress President Pradeep Chhabra
 dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki navjot cor or navjot siddhu kaa ilaaka amritsar kaa he, jahaan se navjot siddhu 2004 se lekar 2014 tak loksabhaa saansad rahe
 Not only this, his wife Navjot Kaur was also an MLA from Amritsar East Assembly seat for a long time
 magar philhal amritsar loksabhaa seat congress ke gurjeet singh aujala ke paas he
 Navjot Kaur says that 'I have applied for Chandigarh from women's quota

 haalanki mujhe unase koi problem nahin he

 Manish Tiwari reached Parliament in 2009 from Ludhiana Lok Sabha seat
 lekin 2014 main unhone loksabhaa kaa chunaav nahin ladaa jiske baad congress ke ravanit singh bittu main chunaav ladaa or philhal vah ludhiana ke saansad hai
 Manish Tiwari met Chandigarh Congress President Pradeep Chhabra on Sunday morning and staked his claim for the Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat
 lekin sabase ahm baat yah he ki chandigarh loksabhaa seat se beete kaaphi samay se purv kendriya mantri pawan kumaar bansal chunaav ladakar jite aa rahe hai
 Although he lost the election from here in 2014, but this time he has submitted his claim again
 pawan kumaar bansal kaa kahana he ki 'chunaav ladane ke liye koi bhi applai kar saktaa he par antim faisalaa to hai kaman kaa hi hoga
 i have worked for forty years

 It is a union territory
 chandigarh loksabhaa seat se chunaav ladane ke liye bade bade congressi netaa maidan main utar chuke hai lekin dhyaan dene vaali baat yah he ki ye seat philhal bijepi kii kiran kher ke paas he
 But Congress leaders feel that this time the atmosphere in Punjab is in their favor, so Chandigarh will also be favorable for them, so Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat has become a hot seat for Congress leaders

 bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah 9 july ko jab chennai main party ke mahashakti centre or shakti centre ke prabhariyon se mili to unhen yah bataaya gaya ki ''vipakshi dal yah kah kar party kaa uphaas uda rahe hai ki tamilnadu main bhaajapa dhundne se bhi nahin milti he
 "with a slight smile, Shah replied," If the opposition wants to find the BJP in Tamil Nadu, then find it in the evms in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 isamen koi sanshay nahin ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main tamilnadu main bhaajapa badi takat ban kar ubharne vaali he
 "he also announced," We will announce an alliance in Tamil Nadu at an appropriate time before the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 jiske saath bhi gathbandhan karenge, yah sunishchit hoga ki rajya bhrashtachar se mukt hokar vikaas ke path par agrasar ho
 "shah's statement is not unintentional
" darasal, unhone tamilnadu ke saath hi un rajyon se bhi pichley do loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon kaa puraa byora lekar bhavi yojana kaa khaakaa taiyaar kar liya he jahaan party kii upasthiti naam maatr he
 The BJP is looking for alliances with small parties (registered but unrecognized) to make its electoral performance effective in such states
 aise dalon se sampark saadhane kaa silsilaa bhi shuru ho gaya he
 This strategy of BJP is also appropriate for Shah's goal in which he has talked about increasing bjp's vote percentage to 50 percent in 2019
 anaupchaarik baatcheet main bhaajapa ke netaa yah maanate hai ki odisha, kerala, andhra pradesh, telugana or pashchim bengal jaise rajyon ke sattadhari dal yaa mukhyamantri itane kaddavar hai ki 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main in rajyon main safalataa hasil karnaa party ke liye kathin he
 At the same time, in the last Lok Sabha elections, in the states where BJP performed well in the triangular or multi-cornered contest, anti-bjp parties are mobilizing
 inamen uttar pradesh, maharashtra, bihar, jharkhand dilli, haryana or purvottar ke rajya shaamil hai
 Even though the influential parties of these states are opposed to each other, but in order to save their existence and stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi, all differences are united by forgetting
 iskaa khamiyaja pichley kuch maheenon ke dauraan hue upachunaavon main bhaajapa ko bhugatna bhi padaa he
 Even in states where BJP is directly facing Congress, the path of BJP is not looking as smooth as 2014
 masalan, gujarat, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, chhattisgarh, himachal pradesh, uttarakhand, goa
 In these states, BJP also realizes the anti-incumbency trend
 amit shah yah baat kai baar doharaa chuke hai, "jin rajyon main 2014 main party ko badi safalataa mili thi, vahaan kuch siton kaa nuksaan ho saktaa he
 We will compensate this deficiency from other states
 coromandal rajya or tateey rajyon main bhaajapa ko 2019 main acchhee safalataa milegi
 "for the last two years, he has also put his team to work on 150 such seats, where BJP has a nominal presence
" bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, "yah sach he ki tamilnadu, kerala, andhra pradesh, odisha, pashchim bengal yaa telugana main party ek takat to he par akele seat jeetne kii sthiti main nahin he
 But this is only one aspect of the coin
 sikke kaa doosraa pahalu yah he ki bhaajapa in rajyon main chote-chote sahyogi dalon ko apane saath jodakar vahaan bade dal ko takkar dene kii sthiti main aegi
 He argues that the BJP did this in Tripura
 vahaan ke chote-chote dalon ko saath jodakar bhaajapa ne rajya main apane boote bahumat hasil kar liya
 In the last Lok Sabha election, Apna Dal in Uttar Pradesh and again in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections of 2017 achieved great success by compromising with Om Prakash Rajbhar's party
 bhaajapa ke ranneetikaar maanate hai ki puure desh main 70 se adhik aisi choti-choti partiyaan hai jo bhale hi apane dam par chunaav nahin jeet sakati hai, lekin in dalon ke paas 50 hajaar se lekar 10 lakh tak vot hai
 These votes may seem small in terms of Lok Sabha elections, but if these parties join the BJP, then it can achieve great success even in those states where it is currently considered weak
 inamen se kai chote dalon kii pakad kisaanon ke bich acchhee he
 Some parties have their own identity in the labor organizations and some in the spiritual world
 masalan, pegent and workars party of india trade union se judaa rajnatik dal he
 Its influence is in Ramgarh, Solapur, Nagpur, Nanded, Nashik in Maharashtra as well as parts of Andhra Pradesh
 is dal kaa chaatro ke bich bhi acha kaam he or iskaa purogami yuva sanghathan naamak chaatr sanghathan kaabhi prabhavi he
 This party wins one or two seats in the assembly, but has not been able to achieve great success in the Lok Sabha elections
 bhaajapa ke ranneetikaron ke mutabik, in dalon ke vot agar bhaajapa ko transfar hote hai to jin siton par bhaajapa 50 hajaar se lekar 1 lakh ke vot se harati he vahaan uske pratyaashee jeet hasil kar sakate hai
 For instance, in Tenkasi in Tamil Nadu, bjp's ally MDMK secured 1,89,386 votes and PTP 2,61,757 votes
 agar donon ke vot jod liye jaae to yah vijayi eiediemke ko mili 4,24,586 vot se 26,557 vot adhik hai
 Obviously, smaller parties can prove to be important in many seats
 shah saaf kar chuke hai ki 2019 main vipakshi dalon se bada kunba rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan (endie) kaa hoga
 So to increase the nda's clan, the anonymous Odisha Party, Bahujan Mukti Party, Bahujan Vikas Aghadi, Bharip Bahujan Mahasangh, Gondwana Republic Republic Party, Jayabharata Parity Party, Jai Samyak Andhra Party, Loksatta Party, Manithanaya Makkal Katchi (MMK), Puthia Tamilagam (PT) ), Pyramid Party of India, Rashtriya Samaj Paksha, VCK, Welfare Party of India, there are many small parties which the BJP has with them Nhe is working
 iske liye rajyon ke sanghathan mantri ko jimmedaari di gai he
 In each booth booth officers have been given written instructions to get the last two Lok Sabha and two assembly election figures from the organization minister to meet the margin of the booths where the party was trailed by 1,000 to 5,000 votes
 Which small team needs to be aligned
 kyon najar he chote dalon parabhajapa ne 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mahaj kuch bade dalon ke saath hi gathjod kiya tha
 At other places, only small parties were included in the NDA clan
 maharashtra main shivasena or andhra pradesh main telegu desham party (tidipi) hi bhaajapa ke saath thim
 In informal conversations, BJP leaders say that there is more dependence on big parties
 baat bigadane kii sambhaavna bhi adhik hoti he
 This has happened many times with the BJP
 masalan, pichley dinon tidipi ne bhaajapa kaa saath chhod diya
 Shiv Sena is also rebuking
 isse bhaajapa ke liye asahaj sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 The BJP has been so strong since 2014 that it has won a majority on its own and is still in that position
 lekin chote dal isliye lajimi hai kyonki jin siton par kam margin se jeet-haar hoti he, vahaan in dalon ke saath aane se bhaajapa kii sthiti behatar hogi or jeet kii sambhaavna banegi
 In the last elections in Bihar, alliance with Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, Apna Dal in Uttar Pradesh, Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra and Ramdas Athawale's RPI worked well
 aise main chote dal bhaajapa ke liye behatar sahyogi sabit ho sakate hai
 Citing the example of Tamil Nadu, a BJP leader says that in the last Lok Sabha election, out of 39 BJP could win only one seat here
 agar rajya main is baar bhaajapa rajya ke piti, visike jaise chote dal or emdmake yaa piemke jaise apekshaakrit rajya ke majhule dalon se gathjod karti he to thiruvallur, chennai dakshin, shreeperambudur, kanchipuram, arakonam samet 10 loksabhaa siton par rajya ke donon pramukh dalon, diemke or eiediemke ko kadi takkad de sakati he
 bjp's Rajya Sabha MP and head of the media department, Anil Baluni, says, "under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the country has developed effectively in the last four years
 pradhanmantri ke kaam or niyat ko dekhte hue bahut se dal endie main shaamil hone kii ichha rakhte hai
 It is certain that in 2019 the nda's clan will be bigger than 2014
 dal chota ho yaa bada, sabhi kaa apana mahatv he
 BJP gives equal respect to all parties
 ''sadhana nahin aasanchhote dalon ko saath lenaa bhaajapa ke liye aasaan nahin he
 Small parties are understanding its importance well this time
 in dalon ko lagata he ki bhaajapa ke saath jane se ek-do seat bhale mil jaae, lekin chunaav jeetne ke baad bhi phayda bhaajapa ko hi hoga
 You will not be in a position to pressure the BJP on one or two mps
 shetakari sanghathan ke raju shetty kehete hai, "jin baton ko lekar bhaajapa sahyog maangati he usase baad main mukar jaati he
 In 2014, we went with the BJP for the interests of farmers, but after forming the government, it ignored our talk about the problem of farmers and we had to move away from the BJP
 ''vahiin tamilnadu ke piti party ke netaa doctor ke
 Krishnasamy says, "all the parties who come to talk about alliances with us know our importance
 par hamaara kaam sirf ek yaa do saansadon ko jitaana nahin he balki yah jaananaa jaruri he ki ve hamaari vichaardhaara ko kitni ahmiyat dete hai
 If there was talk of reaching Parliament only, then why would we form our own party, we would have joined Congress or BJP
 ''isi tarah maharashtra kii bharip bahujan mahasang ke netaa prakaash ambedkar bhi bhaajapa kii kadi aalochana karte rahe hai
 An official of the more active Pyramid Party in Andhra Pradesh says, "we are well aware that some big parties want to serve their interests with our support, but they should understand very well what we want
" chunki shaakaahaar, parforming art or aadhyatmikta hamaari mul vichaardhaara he, so jo bhi inaki baat karegaa ham uske saath jane ke mudde par vichaar kar sakate hai
 "the Congress also has an idea of the importance of small parties
 It is evident from this that it is not only the BJP but the Congress too is watching them
" congress ke media vibhaag ke pramukh randeep surajevaala kehete hai, "desh main jis tarah kaa maahaul he usamen koi badi party ho yaa choti, sabake adhikaron kaa daman kiya ja rahaa he
 Everyone is realizing this
 isliye congress un sabhi dalon se sahyog kii apeksha karti he jo is desh kii bahulata main yakeen karti hai
 No party is untouchable for the Congress
 jahaan tak baat gathbandhan or seat bantwaare kii he to congress main e
 K
 antni cameti iske liye adhikrut he
 She will consider this subject
 loktantr kii raksha ke liye jaruri he ki chote-bade sabhi dal ek saath aaen
 "A Congress leader says," Many smaller parties are ideologically close to the Congress
 chaahe vah tamilnadu kaa memke ho yaa hindi pattee kaa kaumi ekta dal yaa maharashtra kaa rashtriya samaaj paksh
 Surjewala, while taking a sarcasm at the BJP, says, "the way the BJP is now trying to help small parties in every state, it is clear that it is assuming that any big party in any state Not willing to go with him
 jo saath main the ve chhodkar chale gaye or kuch chhod kar jane ko taiyaar baithe hai
 "the way the big parties are currently trying to defeat each other in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it will increase the importance of smaller parties and they can also play an important role in winning and losing many seats
" 
 jaahir he, sthaneey or chote-chote mudde loksabhaa chunaav ko bhale hi bahut prabhavit nahin karte hon, par jin siton par kaante kaa muqabla hoga vahaan chote dalon ke saath unke mudde bhi nirnaayak bhoomika main ho sakate hai

 divakaran ne is silsile main fasebuk par sandesh post kiya he
 What is written by Divakaran? In this post, Divakaran writes that these videos would be enough to prove the close relationship between 'amma' (jayalalithaa) and 'chinamma' (sasikala)
 unhone aspataal main ilaaj karvaa rahi jayalalita kii tasviir naa jari karne kii vajah bhi bataane kaa daawa kiya he
 According to Divakaran, 'sasikala did not release Jayalalithaa's photographs even after being accused of being a murderer

 This decision was made by Sasikala

 The State High Court has given a big shock to the tourists who want to visit Uttarakhand
 hoicourt ne uttarakhand main river rafting, paragliding or water sports ko band karne ke nirdesh die hai
 The Uttarakhand High Court during the hearing of a PIL has directed the state government to completely stop white river rafting, paragliding and other water sports (water sports) in the state till policy is made
 court ne kaha ki rafting ke naam par gandagi failaane kii sweekruti nahin di ja sakati

 nyaayalay ne vaahanon main raft ko nadi tak le jane par bhi roak laga di he, ab raft ko nadi se ek nishchit duuri se lebar ke madhyam se hi le jaaya ja sakegaa

 is yachika main unhone rajya sarkaar ko aade haathon lete hue kaha tha ki pradesh sarkaar ne river rafting camp ke liye license diya tha, jiskaa galat istemaal kiya gaya

 lekin virendra ne sharton kaa ulanghan kiya or ganga nadi ke kinare paryatakon ke liye camp lagaana shuru kar diya
 Not only this, due to the gathering of tourists, the water started becoming dirty and garbage was also dumped in the river
 court ne ab yahaan rafting, camping, paragliding or water sports par bain lagane ke saath-saath uchit kanoon banane kaa nirdesh diya he
 The court directs that the ban will continue here until the state government makes the law

 yah to sabhi jaanate hai lekin kya aapane kabhi aisa dekha he ki koi bhi raajnneetik party apni mahila ummidavaar kaa cheharaa hi chunavi maidan main na utaare? aisi hi ek tasviir aajkal soshal media main viral ho rahi he, jisamen ek chunavi poster main us uskeraajnneetik partike bade purush netaaon ke tasviir to chhapi hui he

 co / cgaukdqexc — Shad Begum (@shadbegum) July 17, 2018 There are 3 big parties in Pakistan, which hold power there
 lekin is baar kuch kattarpanthi or dharmik sanghathan bhi is baar desh main ho rahe hai, aam chunaav main kud pade hai
 Out of that, it is a party "tehreek-e-labbaik Pakistan Party"
 iske mukhiya hai khalid hossain rizvi jo twitor par apane aap ko mahaan vidwaan bataate hai or rakhte he dakiyanoosee soch
 According to Pakistan's news website Dawn, Khalid Hussain Rizvi has previously been an officer in the Religious Affairs Department of the Punjab Government of Pakistan
 adhikari rahete wo vahaan par apni dakayanoosee soch or bhadakaane vaale bhaashan dete rahete the, jiske liye unhen naukari se barkhaast kar diya gaya
 (tehreek-e-labbaik is the head of Pakistan Party, Khalid Hussain Rizvi) The 2018 Pakistan general election is going to be different this time in many ways
 lekin is tarah kii kattarpanthi soch rakhane vaali kai or rajnatik partiyaan bhi chanavi maidan main hai, jisamen se ek pramukh party aatankwaadi haafiz said kii bhi he, jisane pehle "milli muslim lig" ke binar tale apni party kaa registration karavaaya
 But when the Pakistan election put a halt to it, then under the banner of a party called "allah Ho Akbar Tehreek", all the terrorists were fielded
 isi soch ke saath pakistan kii satta main aane ko betaab he is tarah ke charampanthi gut
 Major women leaders of other political parties in Pakistan have also been appointed as star campaigners
 saath hi mahila ummidavaar bhi jor-shor se chunaav prachaar main lagi hai
 At the same time, "tehreek-e-labbaik Pakistan Party" has disappeared the face of women candidates
 yahaan tak ki mahila ummidavaar reliyon ke madhyam se bhi chunavi abhiyaan main hissaa nahin le sakate hai
 Instead, tehreek-e-labbaik is the head of the Pakistan Party
 kalid hossain rizvi or anya duusare purush netaaon ne hi chunavi prachaar kii kaman sanbhal rakhi he
 (PTI Party candidate from National Assembly 125 only) Dr
 yashmin rashid)vaise is tarah kii ghatana pakistan main chaunkaane vaali nahin hai
 Where the world has gone so far
 vahaan pakistan main mahila kaa upyog rikt sthaan bharne ke liye hi hota he
 Unfortunately, countries like Pakistan still have a long way to go

 This elephant came on the railway track from the forest of Chapramari
 haadase ke baad ghayal hathi railway trek se kareeb sau meter tour tak ghistate hue gaya or iske baad isane dam tod diya
 The elephant has severe injury marks on its body, but the railway is denying any accident
 kisi bhi train driver ne bhi is haadase ke bare main jaankaree nahin di he
 There are a large number of wild elephants in this area and there is often a danger of them coming on track
 isi vajah se trek ke paas aagaah karne vaale board bhi lagaae gaye hai, lekin logon kaa kahana he ki rail driver kabhi bhi train kii raftaar kam nahin rakhte hai, jisase is tarah ke haadase hote rahete hai

 The question arises that on the basis of the functioning of the Modi government, will the BJP once again get a 2014 majority or will the Congress end the 5-year drought, or will the people of the country choose a third option? All these questions will be answered after the election
 lekin isse pehle ajtak ne desh kaa mizaaj jaanane kii koshish kii
 The figures coming out in the survey of Aaj Tak and Karvy Insights may raise concern for BJP
 survey ke nattejey bataate hai ki agar pidipi, tiemasi, basapa or samaajawaadee party upie main shaamil hoti hai to iskaa nuksaan endie ko hota dikh rahaa he
 At the same time, even if AIADMK and YSRCP join NDA, NDA will not get the benefit
 pidipi, tiemasi, basapa or samaajawaadee party ke upie main shaamil hone se upie ko 44 fisadi vot milane kaa anumaan he
 At the same time, the NDA can get 40 percent of the vote, while others are seen getting 16 percent of the vote
 aise main saaf he ki is tarah se endie kii siten bhi kam hongi
 The NDA, which won 336 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, looks to lose 102 seats and may be limited to 234 seats
 vahiin upie ko banpar phayda miltaa dikh rahaa he

 BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that BJP has taken this statement of Digvijay Singh seriously
 madhya pradesh main chunaav aa rahe hai
 Just before the Lok Sabha elections, such a statement shows the core agenda of the Congress
 vidhansabha or loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte huecongressthushtikaran kii raajnneeti par utar ai he
 It is sad that Digvijay is again making such a statement
 congress kii sajizunhone kaha ki hamane yah khulaasa kiya ki congress upie sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan hindu aatankwaad kaa frej gadhane kaa kaam karti thi or ise court main sabit karne kii koshish bhi kii, jise court ne khaarij kar diya

 During that time, he also accused the Sangh of running a terrorist camp
 pakistan ko phaydapatra ne kaha ki id se pehle kashmir main varisht patrkaar shujaat bukhari kii hatya main pakistan kaa haath bataaya ja rahaa he
 At such a time, Hindus are being described as terrorists, which directly benefit Pakistan
 inhen bayanon ke aadhaar par pakistan antarrashtriya birdari ko bataata he ki seemapar se koi aatankwaad nahin he balki wo hindu aatankwaadi hai
 Sambit Patra said, 'BJP demands that Digvijay Singh be removed from the Congress, we are not demanding an apology from him, rather we want him to be suspended from the party
 yah behad gambhir maamla he
 'what did you say Digvijay Singh? In the last days, Congress leader Digvijay Singh had given a disputed statement in Jhabua that all the Hindu terrorists who have appeared so far have been associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)
 digvijay singh ne kaha, 'mahatma gandhi kii hatya karne vaala nathuram godse bhi kabhi sangh se judaa tha
 This ideology spreads hatred
 ghrinaa hinsa ko badhaava detii he or hinsa phir aatankwaad kii ore le jaati he
 'he had said,' All Hindu-religion terrorists have been caught, all have been Sangh activists
 'asal main america agency siie dwaara bajrang dal or vishwa hindu parishad ko ugravadi sanghathan or aresas ko rashtravaadi sanghathan bataae jane ke bare main sawaal par digvijay ne yah baat kahi thi
