 If there is a case of UP soldier recruitment then do not mail hundreds
 usase koi laabh nahin
 One or two matches is enough

 If the plane is late then the passengers will get refund or compensation up to 2 xxrep 4 0 
 to phir rail yatri ko kyon nahin milanaa chahie
 When Jayant Sinha can take such a decision, then why is Piyush Goyal not doing this? ho saktaa he ki kisi ko lage ki train kaa deree se chalanaa saamaanya baat he magar kitne logon kii jindagi barbaad ho jaati he yaa ho sakati he aap nahin samaj sakate
 On the night of 23 May, at 10:33 AM, a citizen tweets to the Railway Minister and the Ministry of Railways that 'sir train is 6 hours late
 meraa bhai esasabi ke intervyuu ke liye kapoorthala ja rahaa he
 He has to report at six in the morning but the train is running very late
 ' We contacted this person to see what happened
 kya vah esasabi yani seemaa suraksha bal kii pariksha main shaamil ho paaya
 It was learned that his brother left the train in Jalandhar and reached with a taxi
 par hamane is train kaa record dekha
 Its name is Saryu Yamuna Express and number 14649 runs from Jayanagar to Amritsar in Bihar
 11 may se 15 may ke bich jayanagar se amritsar pahunchane main iske let hone kaa ausat he 15 ghanta 20 minute
 One day arrived at a delay of 10 hours 20 minutes and one day with a delay of 23 hours 16 minutes
 isliye hamaara sawaal he ki kya hawaii yatriyon kii tarah rail yatriyon ko deree ke kaaran hone vaale nuksaan kaa muawza nahin milanaa chahie
 They too should not get free breakfast water in the moving train
 agar aap sahi maang karenge to bilkul aisa hoga
 There is no problem
 aap hi bataaiye mujhe kya karnaa chahie
 For 15 days, students of Ambedkar University in Bihar have been messaging them to get their exams done
 inaki sankhya paanch das hazaar nahin he, do lakh he
 One lakh in BA Part One, one lakh in BA Part Two
 kya do lakh chaatro kii zindagi se judaa maamla is vakt desh ke liye badi khabar nahin he
 The one who took admission in 2015 has undergone a one-year examination whereas by now the three-year examination should have been completed
 bie puraa ho janaa chahie tha
 Those who have taken admission in 2016 and 2017 have not had a single examination
 ye mazaaq sirf bharat ke chaatro ke saath ho saktaa he
 With the help of Suman Saurabh, Shashiranjan and Kaushal Kishore, we have got students' feedback
 kaushal ke alaava chaatro ne bhi is dhoop main sab record kar bheja he
 The comments bhimrao ambedkar uniwarsity kii yah imaarat baahar se to chamachama rahi he
 The road is also good
 magar iskaa record kya he
 Look at the students
 apane in saamaanya kamaron main chupchaap taiyaari main lage hai, padhai karte hai, kitna dhiraj he inamen
 But what is our university doing with them? duniya main aap koi ek desh kaa naam bataa sakate hai jahaan teen saal ke bie ke course kaa ek bhi imtahaan na hua he
 The Vice Chancellor and all the staff of the University should be dismissed as a rule
 magar ho kya rahaa he
 Are the first and second year students not in that great India, which has been named in the press conference of ministers today, like it was not before? inaki zindagi jo barbaad ho rahi he uske liye koun sa mantri press conference karegaa
 The student leader also says that his movement does not yield any results, but the student leader also took the editions in 2016, he has not even had a test
 kul sachiv ne phone par bataaya ki june tak inaki pariksha ho jaaegi
 But the date was not announced
 24 may ko aap kaise kah sakate hai ki june main pariksha lenge
 How can any society take this problem lightly
 do lakh chaatro kii pariksha na ho
 Whether there is admission in a three-year BA and there is no examination for two years, its accountability should be fixed or not
 agar koi yah samaj rahaa he ki ye sabhi do lakh chaatr apni barbaadi kaa jashn manaa rahe hai, inhen fark nahin padataa to ho saktaa he aap galat hai
 The condition of university across India is not bad, it is junk
 agar koi chaatr apane class room, shikshakon kii kami vagairah kii jaankaree dena chahta he, pratiyogita pariksha kii jaankaree dena chaahate hai, rail yatra kii jaankaree dena chahta he to ek kaam kare
 Read it carefully
 camro ko aap is tarah se pakad kar record kiijie taaki wide angel shot aa sake
 Standing and recording leaves a lot of blank on the TV screen
 saath hi aap camere ko thodaa nazadik bhi le jaaen taaki thik se dikhe or dur bhi le jaaen taaki aas paas kii chizein bhi dikhen
 After this you write us every detail with name, number, primetimewithravish @ gmail
 com par bhej den
 Keep in mind one thing
 agar upi kii sipaahi bhartee kaa maamla he to saikadon mail na karen
 There is no benefit from that
 ek yaa do mail kaaphi he
 Provide all information hawaii jahaaz let hoga to hawaii yatriyon ko 2 xxrep 4 0 tak rifund yaa muawza milegaa
 Then why should not the rail passenger be found
 jab jaint sinha aisa faisla le sakate hai to phir piyush goyal aisa kyon nahin kar rahe hai
 Maybe someone feels that it is normal for the train to run late, but how many people's lives are ruined or maybe you cannot understand
 23 may kii raat 10 baj kar 33 minute par ek naagarik rail mantri or rail mantralay ko twit karata he ki 'sar train 6 ghante let he
 My brother is going to Kapurthala for SSB interview

 In a severe firefight in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday, 36 people died of burns while 50 others were injured
 nikatavarti mudhalipattee main ek pataakhaa factory parisar main lagi aag ne factory or parisar ke 48 shed ko tabah kar diya
 Police and fire sources said the accident occurred when factory workers were mixing chemicals to make colorful light-fired fireworks
 aag lagane se bahut se majdoor bheetar funs gaye
 The fire in the firecracker factory in this normally quiet village caused panic everywhere
 rah rahakar uthati dhamaakon kii aawaaj kareeb do kilometre ke daayre main sunai detii rahi
 The thick smoke spread over the area and the people trapped in the fire burnt so badly that it is difficult to even identify them
 haadase main hataahat hue logon main zyaadaatar factory main kaam karne vaale majdoor hai
 a tragic thing happened, police said, adding that some people who had entered the Om Shakti factory premises to save the people engulfed in the fire, also succumbed to the fire
 sutron ne bataaya ki sarkari paraamarsh kaa ulanghan karte hue saare pataakhon ko ek hi godaam main rakhaa gaya tha
 Fire brigade employees had to face a lot of difficulties due to lack of necessary items for relief work
 unke paas is tarah kii bheeshan aag ke khilaaf abhiyaan chalaane ke liye mask jaise jaruri upkarnon kaa abhaav tha
 They controlled the fire after four hours of hard work
 parisar ke ghaney dhuen main na ghus paane ke kaaran raahat or bachaav kaary prabhavit hua
 Labor department officials say the factory owner is absconding and did not heed the advice not to keep the stock of chemicals in one place
 pratyakshdarshiyon ne bataaya ki log dadhakati lapaton se ghire cheekh rahe the
 Relief workers rushed many injured to motorbikes, cots and shoulders
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki factory main kaam karne vaale zyaadaatar majdoor akushal the or kuch pashchim bengal ke the, jinhen tamil bhashaa nahin aati thi, jisaki vajah se vah baaki logon ko aag lagane kii bare main bataa nahin paae
 Superintendent of Police of Virudhunagar district Najmul Hoda said that 90 percent of the total firecrackers made in the country are made in Sivakasi
 deepawali utsav sir par hone ke kaaran pataakhe banane kaa kaam yudhstar par chal rahaa tha
 a factory official said that 300 people were working in the unit at the time of the accident
 haadase ke baad factory ke baahar hajaaron log jamaa ho gaye, jo factory main kaam karne vaale apane sage sambandhiyon kii khayr khabar jaanane ke liye utsuk the
 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced a grant of Rs two lakh each to the kin of those who died and sent a team of five ministers to the spot to monitor the relief operations
 oktober 2009 main tiruvallur jile main pallipattu main pataakhon ke ek godaam main aag lagane se 32 logon kii maut ho gai thi
 Most of them went out to shop for Diwali
 varisht mantri o paneersevalam or unke chaar anya sahyogi raahat abhiyaanon par najar rakhane ke liye ghatnasthal par bheje gaye hai
 There are about 450 cracker factories in Sivakasi, where about 40,000 people work
 ek lakh se adhik log apratyaksh rup se isse jude hai or yahaan kaa vashirk kaarobaar 800 se 1000 karod rupee kaa he
 When the minister Paneesvalam and others reached the hospital to see the injured in Sivakasi, the family members of the victims surrounded them
 ye log aspataal main aparyaapt suvidhaon or dawaaon kii kami kii shikaayat kar rahe the
 Police said that in another incident, the foreman of the fire cracker unit was arrested in connection with the accident
 controlar of explocivs ke ek adhikari rohit sharma ne ghatnasthal kaa daura kiya
 He told that when chemicals are mixed, there is a possibility of accident during that time
 ek anya adhikari ne bataaya ki hawa main ud jane vaale rasayanon ko store room main rakhaa janaa chahie, lekin yahaan unhen shed main rakhaa gaya tha, jisase aag lag gai
 He said that the place where the fire was not enough to work for 300 laborers was probably why the number of casualties was so high

 i told that i would follow the talk of Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz when he would properly present a summary to me
 uske baad ajij ne apane staff ke jariye president house main mere paas ek saransh bhijwaya
 General Musharraf never denied the imposition of the emergency, but he told the people on whose advice the emergency was imposed

 yah lagaataar chalane vaali party jaisaa tha
 i befriended everyone except the three people who were behind the scenes
 ' deepashikha ne punit issar, pranit bhatta or preetam singh ko peeth main chura ghonpane vaala bataaya
 Bigg Boss: Deepshikha, who has done TV shows like Pyaar Aur Jung, all justified, 'son Pari' and 'hoga Juda Na Hum', is particularly angry with Puneet
 dance reality sho 'nach baliye' kii contestant rah chuki deepashikha ne punit issar ke bare main baat karte hue kaha, 'vah avishwasaneey rup se dogale hai
 When we were part of a secret society and locked in a room, i took care of her like a mother
 vah bahut biimaar ho gaye the, kyonki unhen band jagahon se ghabrahat hoti he
 He was also very thankful for my care and concern
 lekin punit jab 'big bos' ke ghar gaye to unka bartaav badal gaya
 Initially i thought that he did not know how to keep pace with other contestants
 mujhe ab ahsaas hota he ki vah kitne bade khilaadi hai
 'welcome to' Bigg Boss 008 Airlines Apart from this, Deepshikha while talking about the best moments spent in 'bigg Boss' said,' i have made a lot of friends in 'bigg Boss' house
 maine sabhi contestant ko kaha sho khatm hone ke baad ham sab mere farm house main milakar ek party karenge
 In 'bigg Boss', a lot is known about the behavior of humans in these 20 days

 rajasthan ke skulon main ab nayaa itihaas padhaayaa jayega
 In the Class 10 Social Science book of Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education, there is a preparation to teach new history related to Haldighati war
 nae itihaas ke mutabik haldighati yuddh main maharana pratap jite the or akbar kii sena haar kar bhaag gai thi
 Till now it was taught that neither Maharana Pratap won the battle of Haldighati nor Akbar's army but according to what will be taught now, the battle of Haldighati was not inconclusive
 nae itihaas ke mutabik maharana pratap apni mathrubhumi mewar kii raksha ke liye bahaduri se lade the or unki sena ne akbar kii sena ko ladaai ke maidan se bhaga diya tha
 State School Education Minister Vasudev Devnani justified this, saying that till now history was not being taught properly but now it has been fixed
 shiksha mantri ne kaha ki agar akbar haldighati kaa yuddh jeetta to lautakar 6 baar hamalaa kyon karata? wo baar-baar hamalaa isliye karata tha kyonki wo har baar parajeet ho rahaa tha
 As soon as the government was formed in Rajasthan, the Education Minister had first removed the chapter named 'akbar the Great' and said that why is Akbar the Great? Why is Maharana Pratap not great? After this a research was conducted by Dr
 Chandrashekhar Sharma, a professor at Meera Kanya Mahavidyalaya, Rajasthan Legislative University, Udaipur
 is shodh main unhone paaya ki ki haldighati kii 18 june 1576 kii ladaai main maharana pratap ne akbar ko haraaya tha
 Dr
 sharma ne apane research main pratap kii jeet ke paksh main tamra patron ke pramaan janardanarai nagar rajasthan vidhapith vishwavidhalay main jamaa karaae hai
 According to Sharma's discovery, for the next one year after the war, Maharana Pratap had distributed leases of lands in the adjoining villages of Haldighati in the form of copper letters, which are signed by Diwan Pratap of Eklinganath
 us samay jameenon ke patte jari karne kaa adhikaar sirf raja ko hi hota tha
 Which proves that Pratap won the war
 dow
 Sharma has researched that after the Haldighati war, Akbar was angered by Mughal commanders Man Singh and Asif Khan losing the war
 donon ko chah mahine tak darbar main nahin aane kii sajaa di gai thi
 Sharma says that if the Mughal army had won, Akbar would not have punished his beloved generals
 isse saaf jaahir he ki maharana ne haldighati ke yuddh ko sampurna saahas ke saath jeeta tha
 Dr
 sharma kaa ye shodh jaipur ke kishanpol vidhansabha kshetra se bijepi vidhayak mohanlal gupta ne padhi or rajasthan sarkaar se itihaas badalane ke liye chitthee likhi

 chandrashekhar sharma kii khoj ko sahi maanate hue rajasthan vishwavidhalay ne apane paathyakram main badlaav kiya

 film 'dilliwaali zaalim garlfriend' kii kahani he dilli main rah rahe do doston dhruv or happy kii

 is ladki ke chakkar main dhruv or happy car lone lekar ek car kharid lete hai, jo bahut jald chori ho jaati he or phir shuru hoti he bhagdaud
 Directed by Japinder Kaur, the film features a gang of car thieves
 kis tarah parking main khadey raseed kaatane vaale se lekar police tak is giroh kaa saath detii he or kis tarah car ko chori karke unke rang or number ko badalakar bechaa jaataa he
 The subject of the film is good, but there are many shortcomings in writing it on paper and on the screen
 dhruv or happy puri film main ek reporter ke saath milakar sting oparation ke peeche pade rahe, magar uskaa khulaasa utana hi kamjor
 Everything in the film seems incomplete
 phir wo chaahe lav ho, sting oparation ho yaa kahani ho
 Even the issue of theft of vehicles remained incomplete
 haa, gane puure hai, yani jarurat se zyada
 i think it is a weak film, for which my rating is 1

 Social activist and thinker KN Govindacharya believes the Modi government's decision to ban 500 and 1000 currency notes that only 3% black money can come out of ending 500 and 1000 notes
 fasebuk par likhe lekh main unhone kaha he ki pradhanmantri modi ji dwaara500 or 1000 ke notesamaapt karne ke faisle se pehle main bhi achambhit hua or aanandit bhi
 But after thinking deeply for some time, all the excitement ended
 note samaapt karne or phir bazaar main nae bade note laane se adhiktam 3% kaala dhan hi baahar aa paaegaa or modi ji kaa donon kaamon kaa nirnay koi doorgaami parinaam nahin laa paaegaa
 Only one more election will remain as a jumla
 noton ko is prakaar samaapt karnaa- 'khoda pahaad, nikali chuhia' siddh hoga
 Let's try to understand
 unhone likhaa ki arthshaastriyon ke anusaar bharat main 2015 main jidipi ke lagbhag 20%arthvyavastaakale bazaar ke rup main vidyaman thi
 At the same time it was up to 40% at the time of 2000, that is, gradually decreasing to 20%
 2015 main bharat kaa sakal gharelu utpaada lagbhag 150 lakh karod tha, arthath usee varsh desh main 30 lakh karod rupee kalaadhan bana
 Thus, a minimum of Rs 400 lakh crore black money has been made between 2000 and 2015
 lekh main ve aage kehete hai ki rigerv bank ke anusaar march 2016 main 500 or 1000 rupee ke kul noton kaa kul mulya 12 lakh karod tha jo desh main uplabdh 1 rupee se lekar 1000 tak ke noton kaa 86% tha
 Even if we assume that all the 500 and 1000 rupee notes available in the country were deposited as black money, which is impossible, even then only 400% of the Rs 400 lakh crore deposited in the last 15 years is only 3% of the black money

 ' The seat sharing broke owaisi-ambedkar's relationship with aimim's demand for 50 seats in Maharashtra to give 8 seats to Prakash Ambedkar, Maharashtra: Asaduddin Owaisi's party All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) doubles its number of seats from 2 to 2
 Is engaged in reaching the digit
 isi ke maddenjar ovaisi kii AIMIM ne maharashtra kii 50 vidhansabha siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya he
 But the underprivileged Bahujan Agadi (VBA), led by Prakash Ambedkar, the Dalit leader and grandson of Bhimrao Ambedkar, wants to give them just 8 seats
 isi ke chalate AIMIM ne bahujan agaadi se naata tod liya he or akele chunavi maidan main utarane kaa faisla kiya he
 But Prakash Ambedkar is currently trying to ally with Owaisi
 iske liye unhone teen sadasyeey cameti gathit kar di he or prakaash ambedkar kehete hai ki ovaisi se gathbandhan ke liye aakhri din tak intjaar karuunga
 In the Lok Sabha elections this year, Prakash Ambedkar and Owaisi's party came together in Maharashtra
 ovaisi kii party AIMIM ek seat jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi
 Also, this alliance surprised everyone by securing 14 percent of the total votes cast
 is gathbandhan ne congress-ensipi ko kareeb 12 loksabhaa siton par khaasaa nuksaan pahunchaaya tha
 Whereas before in the 2014 Maharashtra assembly elections, AIMIM contested 25 seats and managed to win 2 seats
 yahi vajah he ki ab AIMIM apane aadhaar ko or bhi badhanaa chaahati he
 Maharashtra President of AIMIM and MP from Aurangabad Imtiaz Jalil aajtak
 in se baatcheet karte hue kaha ki gathbandhan prakaash ambedkar ke vyavhaar kii vajah se tutaa he
 In such a situation, if they have to combine, then clear the picture about the seat
 unhone kaha ki prakaash ambedkar AIMIM ko mahaj 8 siten dena chaahate hai
 While we have decided to contest 50 seats
 12 siton par to hamane apane ummidavaaron ke naam kaa elaan bhi kar diya he
 In such a situation, if they have to form an alliance then take a decision soon, otherwise we are ready to enter the electoral arena alone
 vahiin, prakaash ambedkar ne aajtak
 Talking to in that our alliance was already decided
 loksabhaa ke chunaav ke samay congress ne hamase kaha tha ki ovaisi ko chhod do to ham gathbandhan kar lenge
 At that time we preferred to go with Owaisi instead of Congress
 vidhansabha chunaav main AIMIM ne khud naata todaa he
 While we still want an alliance, we have formed a three-member committee for this
 isi cameti ko tay karnaa he
 However, we will wait for the Owaisi coalition till the last day of the election

 Shahid Kapoor is in a lot of headlines these days
 chaahe 'coffee vid karan' main patni mira sang romance kii baat ho yaa sanjay lila bhansaali kii film 'padmavati' kii
 Now Shahid has once again come into the discussion regarding his tweet
 maine apni shaadi main eks garlfrends ko bulaayaa tha:shahid kapoorshahiyapane parivaar ko lekar kitne pojesive hai, ye to sab jaanate hi hai
 Actually, Shahid has trolled the photographers who always take a picture of their daughter Meesha by tweeting
 shahid-mira kaa 'coffee vid karan' main romanceshahidne twit kiya, 'ek choti bacchee ke ankhon ke 2 feet saamne se 20 camera photo khinchate rahete hai

 — Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor)january 5, 2017 It is often talked about in the office that he was a good employee, i do not know why he was not asked to stop when he designed
 At the same time, it is also surprising that an employee who was doing good work and was getting good salary, suddenly left the job
 naukari chhodane ke peeche kaa kaaran yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki ho saktaa he vah abnaukarikarna hi nahin chaah rahaa ho
 This may be the reason behind leaving the job, but the big reason for this is something else that you will be surprised to know
 1
 Employees leave neither because of job boss nor because of work pressure
 ve naukari apane suparvizer ke kaaran chhodte hai
 According to a Tiny Pulse survey, employees often want to work in a professional manner
 agar unka suparvizer unke saath sahyog nahin karata he to venaukari chhodnabehatar samajhate hai
 2
 vahiin, isaki duusari badi vajah sahakarmi hai
 If praise is received from colleagues for doing good work, then good employees feel that their work in the office is not being paid attention, hence they decide to leave the job

 Political attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Dream Project Bullet Train are steadily intensifying
 maharashtra navnirmaan sena ke adhyaksh raaj thakare ke baad ab congress netaa ahamed patel ne bhi is project par sawaal uthaa die hai
 Ahmed Patel has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that he is not opposed to this project, but the rights of farmers should not be taken away in the name of this project
 ahamed patel ne apni chitthee main likhaa he ki NHSRC jila adhikariyon ke saath milakar kisaanon kii jameen kaa adhigrahan kar rahe hai, lekin kisaanon kii shikaayat he ki is dauraan 2013 ke bhoomi adhigrahan bill ke niyamon kaa paalan nahin kiya gaya he
 Our objective is not to obstruct the project the government is undertaking
 But in the process of building a bullet train one can’t bulldoze the constitutional rights of farmerspic

 Raj Thackeray has also opposed Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Tuesday appealed to the farmers of Maharashtra not to give their land for the Mumbai - Ahmedabad bullet train project
 palghar jile ke vasai main ek jan sabha main thakare ne kaha, ‘‘yahaan ke logon ko mumbai - ahmedabad bullate train or mumbai - vadodara express ve ke liye apni jameen nahin bechni chahie
 On May 1, 1960, Thackeray said in reference to the creation of Maharashtra and Gujarat, it was a move to buy land in the name of bullet train and to remove Marathi people from Mumbai (and its surrounding areas)
 aapako bataa den ki abhi kuch hi din pehle hi gujarat ke kisaan apana virodh jataa chuke hai
 The protest of farmers in Gujarat over land acquisition is causing problems
 is project ke liye kisaan apni jameen nahin dena chaahate hai
 Therefore, they are strongly opposed to land acquisition

 sonam capur dwaara nibhaayaa gaya neeraja kaa kirdaar ab kangana kii queen ke kirdaar par baari padataa nazar aa rahaa he
 Actually, a famous ticket booking portal got voting on their site and asked whether they liked Kangana's character more in the movie Queen or Sonam Kapoor in the movie Neerja? The site claims that in this poll, Sonam defeated Kangana where 52% of the audience voted in favor of Sonam while 48% of the audience liked Kangana's acting more
 queen main kangana ke abhinay ko bahut vaahvahee mili thi or iske liye unhen rashtriya puraskaar tak mil chukaa he
 But now the same is happening with Sonam after Neerja and it is being called the best acting of her life so far
 saath hi kamai ke maamle main bhi neeraja ne queen ko pachhad diya he
 It is also possible that Neerja and Sonam's magic will prevail in the next award season as the film's appreciation and success are coming together
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaav main na ladane kaa elaan kar bhale hi apane prashansakon ko niraash kar diya, lekin unke pati is faisle se behad khush hai
 Sushma's husband Swaraj Kaushal tweeted a series of tweets after his wife's decision and said - now thanks for your decision not to contest elections
 swaraj kaushal ne kaha ki mujhe yaad he ek samay milkha singh ko bhi ruknaa padaa tha
 The race started in 1977
 ise ab 41 saal ho gaye hai
 You have contested 11 elections so far
 sirf do baar 1991 or 2004 main aap chunaav nahin ladi thim, kyonki party ne aapako chunavi maidan main nahin utarane diya
 i have been following you for the last 46 years
 ab main 19 saal kaa nahin hum
 Here, Congress leader p Chidambaram has given a political statement on Sushma's decision
 chidambaram ne twit kar kaha he ki madhya pradesh main bijepi kii haalat ko dekhakar sushamaa ne 'maidan chhod' diya he
 Chidambaram said while taunting that Sushma is smart
 vahiin sushamaa swaraj ke 2019 ke chunaav na ladane ke faisle par congressi netaa shashi tharur ne niraashaa jaahir karte hue kaha ki sansad main videsh mantri ke rup main maine unhen hameshaa udaar paaya he
 Will not just contest elections, will remain in politics, responding to writer Swapnadas, Sushma made it clear that she is only declaring not to contest the 2019 elections
 raajnneeti main ve bani rahengi
 Not the result of internal politics, Sushma Swaraj's announcement of not contesting was unexpected
 is faisle se sawaal uthne lage ki wo sehat se pareshaan hai yaa bijepi kii andruni siyasat se
 Asked why a veteran leader like Sushma Swaraj had to make up his mind to retire from elections at the age of 66? Before this announcement, he neither asked the party nor did the party have any air for it
 vikhyath he bhaashan shailisushamaa swaraj ne aaj jo mukaam banaaya he, wo yun hi nahin he
 This position and reputation is earned in connection with their struggles
 unki bhaashan style vikhyath he
 The speeches of his speech are in both the power and opposition queues
 66 saal kii umr main faisle se chaunkaaya66 saal kii sushamaa swaraj party kii behad tajurbekaar netaa hai
 But suddenly, this question is bound to raise questions, because 66 is not a declaration of retirement
 kai baar laga ki sushamaa sarkaar main apni sthiti ko lekar sahaj nahin hai, lekin har baar unhone aise sawaalon ko taal diya
 Questions are arising whether BJP really does not need their experience
 2016 main lambey samay tak raheen thim bimarsushamaa swaraj kaa 2016 main lambey samay tak biimaar raheen
 She was admitted to AIIMS after a kidney operation, but was reactivated after that
 sabko lag rahaa tha ki ab wo saamaanya he, lekin 2019 ke chunaav kii ore badhati hui bijepi ko iskaa ilm katai na tha ki sushamaa swaraj chunaav na ladane kaa elaan karte hue party ko puuchhengi tak nahin

 People of the city have written to the district administration several times to get rid of this monkey, applications have also been made to the forest department, but no solution could be found so far
 ek hajaar se zyada logon ko banaaya nishanaye khoonkhaar bandar ne ab tak 1000 se 1200 logon ko kaat kar apana shikaar bana chukaa he
 This monkey is targeting everyone from children to women
 netaji ko bhi nahin bakhshaargedy netabaikunth yadav bhi bandar ke aatank se nahin batch paae
 He said that we were also sitting near the station when the monkey attacked and injured him
 unki gardan par bandar ne gaharaa jakhm de diya
 Let me tell you that in the 2015 assembly elections, a monkey created terror at the polling booth of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar

 It is the same moral force on which girls protect themselves and fellow boys

 In the video and photos, boys and girls are fighting for their rights by dissolving among themselves

 salaam!is andolan kii acchhee baat he ki sabhi uttar pradesh ke alag-alag zilon se aae hai or haath main takhti binar lekar aae hai
 At this time when the priority of the media has changed, these students are coming from different districts and performing
 sukhad baat yah bhi he ki is andolan main ladkiyaan bhi acchhee sankhya main ai hai
 Probably everyone will be meeting for the first time
 ladkiyaan bhi aapas main dharna sthal par mil rahi hongi
 They say that they have passed the examination according to the eligibility that the government has decided
 jab sarkaar ne farm nikaala to pariksha kii taarikh main maatr main ek maheene kaa vakt diya

 Shiksha Mitra went to court and won
 sarkaar is faisle ko lekar dabl bench gai
 Education friends have got Grace Marks due to previous job, due to which students who got more marks in the new examination lagged behind

 The students involved in the strike were defeated by the court, but now they want the hearing to be early and the results will come

 His statement seems to be right

 Both are face to face
 sarkaar faisle ke kilaaf dabl bench chali gai he
 The Advocate General is not present for the hearing of the double bench
 19 sitambar ko sunwaayee he
 The media has pushed these students out of their range
 ye chaatr bhi media ke khel ko samajhane lage hai
 The media believes that if these students are Savartha slaves of its Hindu Muslim propaganda, then it is wrong
 phir bhi media kaa kaarobaar janata ke bagair chal jaataa he
 Seeing the students in the photographs, they were confident that not all of them have died or are enslaved
 bhale hi in loktantric pradarshnon kii charchaa dilli yaa kahin or nahin hai magar main inhen dekhakar utsahit hum
 The process of becoming a citizen continues in a small group, but right

 It may be that some of those involved in the sit-in demonstration are not selected on the result, but even then they have fought a legitimate battle and this fight will come to life
 unke bheetar kaa bhay chanta he
 Hopefully, boys and girls have learned something during the struggle
 rajya vyavastha kii berukhi ko mahasoos kiya hoga
 It is the only legitimate way to stand before the governments we choose on the basis of religion or falsehood or are cheated even after choosing them on the basis of right understanding
 ahimsa or dhiraj kaa rasta
 i trust that you must have felt your loneliness during the performance
 aapke bheetar jhooth par aadhaarit andh rashtrawaad bharaa gaya

 Because you don't change
 kisi bhi pradarshan kii praasangikta sirf parinaam tak nahin simit nahin honi chahie
 If you and the government do not change, then the torture will continue on other candidates

 There is no hope either

 Cheated on you jonpur, sanbhal yaa gajipur yaa unnav ho, vahaan ke skulon or kalejon ko ghatiya bana diya gaya
 There were no good teachers in the class
 aapkaa chaatr jivan bekaar gaya
 Wish you had a good and quality education, you would have deserved more and the country would have become more beautiful
 in halaaton main badlaav ke koi asaar nahin he
 i will just make a mistake of raising a false hope
 aapmen se jab koi shikshak banegaa to acha or eemaandaar shikshak banegaa
 It will also read itself and fill the students' courtyard with knowledge
 aisa hoga nahin phir bhi ummid karne main kya jaataa he
 As of now, i would like to congratulate you for your commitment to the performances

 In 2012, BJP won 47 out of 403 seats and secured third position in UP assembly elections
 do saal baad narendra modi kii aguwai main kiye gaye loksabhaa chunavi abhiyaan main bijepi ne 337 siten hasil kii thi jo ki kai myanon main aitihaasik maani jaati he
 The Samajwadi Party, which won 226 seats in the 2012 assembly elections, won just 42 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 upi main jeet hasil karne ke liye party ko 403 main se 202 seat yani 35 pratishat vot hasil karne honge
 If we look at the Lok Sabha elections, SP got 42 seats i
e
 30 percent votes
 vahiin bijepi ne 337 seat pain thi yani 43 pratishat vot
 In 2012, this figure was just 15 percent
 tippaniyan To come to power, the BJP will have to tie up 'new voters' in the 2014 Modi wave
 kaaran - bijepi ke jo khantee samarthak hai, unhone pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke vot main 25 pratishat yogadan diya
 But it reached 43 percent in the Lok Sabha elections
 to modi lahar se mila phayda kareeb 18 pratishat rahaa
 And they need at least 35 percent to win
 yani vah 8 pratishat vot khone kaa khatra mol sakate hai or jeetne ke liye bijepi ko 2014 main modi lahar se mili nae votaron ke 10 pratishat hisse ko banaae rakhana hoga
 a look at this graphic to understand clearly - vahiin duusari ore samaajawaadee party or congress ko 35 pratishat vot apane paramparaagat votaron se milte hai
 In 2014, the Modi wave raised their share to just 30 percent
 yaad rahe, res main bane rahane ke liye kam se kam 35 fisadi vot milane jaruri hai
 So to win the alliance this time, the voters who had gone to the BJP in 2014 have to be brought back
 jo samooh 2014 main bijepi ke paas chale gaye the unamem oonchi jati or jatav dalit ahm he
 In 2014, the Yadavs did not betray the SP and the Muslim voters had grown by 5 percent
 (modi lahar se nipatane ke liye muslim vot, sapa or congress ke paas gaye the
 ) to ganit yah he ki sapa-congress gathbandhan ke paas 35 percent parpanraagat vot he jo ki 2014 main girakar 30 pratishat ho gaye the
 That is, five percent voters had left his hand
 jeetne ke liye kam se kam 35 pratishat chahie - to gathbandhan ko jeet hasil karne ke liye un paanch fisadi ko waapas apane kheme main laana hoga jinhen unhone loksabhaa chunaav main kho diya tha
 And the talk of Mayawati
 2014 main unhen 20 pratishat vot mili the
 His main supporters - the Jatav Dalits had stayed with him, just as Yadav was not shaken by the SP despite the Modi wave
 lekin mayawati ke gaiyr-jatav dalit, agadi jati or gaiyr-yadav obisi ke vot bijepi ke paas chale gaye the
 His traditional vote count is 25 percent
 2014 main yah 20 pratishat rah gai thi
 35 percent is required
 to jaruri he ki is baar vah 15 percent or hasil karen - yani haath se nikle 5 pratishat vot ko waapas laaen or 10 pratishat nae voter - jo ki unki virdohi partiyon ke torget se kahin zyada chunauteepurn hai
 To win in UP, the party will have to get 202 seats out of 403 i
e
 35 percent votes
 agar loksabhaa chunaav par najar daalen to sapa ne 42 seat yani 30 pratishat vot paae the
 At the same time BJP got 337 seats i
e
 43 percent votes
 2012 main yah aankada maatr 15 pratishat tha
 The comments satta main aane ke liye bijepi ko 2014 main ai modi lahar main 'nae votaron' ko baandh kar rakhana hoga
 Reason - BJP supporters, who contributed 25 percent in the last assembly election vote
 lekin loksabhaa chunaav main yah 43 fisadi pahunch gaya
 So the benefit from the Modi wave was about 18 percent
 or jeetne ke liye unhen kam se kam 35 pratishat kii jarurat he
 That is, he can afford to lose 8 percent of the vote and to win, the BJP will have to retain 10 percent of the new voters from the Modi wave in 2014
 saaf taur par samajhane ke liye ek nazar is graphic par - On the other hand, Samajwadi Party and Congress get 35 percent votes from their traditional voters
 2014 main modi lahar ne inke hisse ko mahaz 30 pratishat par laakar khadaa kar diya tha
 Remember, at least 35 percent of the votes are required to stay in the race
 to is baar gathbandhan ko jeetne ke liye un votaron ko waapas laana hoga jo 2014 main bijepi ke paas chale gaye the
 Among the groups that went to BJP in 2014, upper caste and Jatav Dalits are important
 2014 main yadavon ne sapa ko dhokhaa nahin diya tha or musalmaan votaron kaa saath 5 percent se bad gaya tha
 (muslim votes went to SP and Congress to deal with Modi wave
 ) So the math is that the sp-congress alliance has 35% traditional vote which fell to 30% in 2014
 yani uske haath se paanch percent voter chale gaye the
 At least 35 per cent is needed to win - then the alliance will have to bring back the five per cent they lost in the Lok Sabha elections to win
 or baat mayawati kii
 In 2014, he received 20 percent votes
 unke mukhya samarthak - jatav dalit unke saath hi rahe the, thik usee tarah jaise modi lahar ke baavjood yadav, sapa se hile nahin the
 But Mayawati's non-jatav Dalit, forward caste and non-yadav OBC votes went to the BJP
 unke paramparaagat voton kii ginati 25 pratishat he
 In 2014, it was reduced to 20 percent
 35 pratishat jaruri he
 So it is imperative that he get 15% more this time - that is, to bring back 5 percent of the votes cast by hand and 10 percent of the new voters - which is more challenging than the target of his rival parties

 kaaran - bijepi ke jo khantee samarthak hai, unhone pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke vot main 25 pratishat yogadan diya
 But it reached 43 percent in the Lok Sabha elections
 to modi lahar se mila phayda kareeb 18 pratishat rahaa
 And they need at least 35 percent to win
 yani vah 8 pratishat vot khone kaa khatra mol sakate hai or jeetne ke liye bijepi ko 2014 main modi lahar se mili nae votaron ke 10 pratishat hisse ko banaae rakhana hoga
 a look at this graphic to understand clearly - vahiin duusari ore samaajawaadee party or congress ko 35 pratishat vot apane paramparaagat votaron se milte hai
 In 2014, the Modi wave raised their share to just 30 percent
 yaad rahe, res main bane rahane ke liye kam se kam 35 fisadi vot milane jaruri hai
 So to win the alliance this time, the voters who had gone to the BJP in 2014 have to be brought back
 jo samooh 2014 main bijepi ke paas chale gaye the unamem oonchi jati or jatav dalit ahm he
 In 2014, the Yadavs did not betray the SP and the Muslim voters had grown by 5 percent
 (modi lahar se nipatane ke liye muslim vot, sapa or congress ke paas gaye the
 ) to ganit yah he ki sapa-congress gathbandhan ke paas 35 percent parpanraagat vot he jo ki 2014 main girakar 30 pratishat ho gaye the
 That is, five percent voters had left his hand
 jeetne ke liye kam se kam 35 pratishat chahie - to gathbandhan ko jeet hasil karne ke liye un paanch fisadi ko waapas apane kheme main laana hoga jinhen unhone loksabhaa chunaav main kho diya tha
 And the talk of Mayawati
 2014 main unhen 20 pratishat vot mili the
 His main supporters - the Jatav Dalits had stayed with him, just as Yadav was not shaken by the SP despite the Modi wave
 lekin mayawati ke gaiyr-jatav dalit, agadi jati or gaiyr-yadav obisi ke vot bijepi ke paas chale gaye the
 His traditional vote count is 25 percent
 2014 main yah 20 pratishat rah gai thi
 35 percent is required
 to jaruri he ki is baar vah 15 percent or hasil karen - yani haath se nikle 5 pratishat vot ko waapas laaen or 10 pratishat nae voter - jo ki unki virdohi partiyon ke torget se kahin zyada chunauteepurn hai

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) The process of breaking the relationship of leaders with the Aam Aadmi Party led by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is not ending
 aam aadmi party ke punjab ke jaito se vidhayak master baldev ne aam aadmi party kii praathmik sadsyta se istipha de diya he
 MLA Master Baldev has sent his resignation via email to Arvind Kejriwal
 master baldev kaa aarope he ki arvind kejariwal sirf dalit card kaa keval istemaal karte hai
 Let me tell you that a few days ago the leader was the opposition and MLA Sukhpal Khaira resigned from the membership of the party
 jaito se aam aadmi party se vidhayak master baldev singh ne arvind kejariwal ko i-mail ke jariye bheje patr main likhaa he ki vah kaaphi dukhi man se party kii praathmik sadsyta se istipha de rahe hai kyonki party ne mul vichaardhaar or siddhaton ko puri tarah chhod diya he
 He further wrote- i was greatly inspired by the anti-corruption movement started by Anna Hazare and thus decided to be a part of the AAP
 hamaare desh kii vishesh rup se hamaare rajya punjab kii saamaajik-raajnneetik sthiti ko sudhaarney ke liye main pradhan shikshak ke taur par sarkari naukari chhodane kaa faisla kiya tha
 However, i had a four-year job

 But still i preferred to take the risk because of the lofty promises made by you and AAP
 isse pehle punjab main aam aadmi party se nilambit chal rahe vidhayak sukhpal singh khera ne party kii praathmik sadsyta se istipha de diya tha
 Khaira had written his resignation letter to Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal and made many allegations
 bataa den ki beete kuch samay pehle sukhpal khera aap netritv ke khilaaf baghawat kar di thi or unako party se nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 However, Sukhpal Khaira, along with some mlas, intensified the reception against the central leadership
 haalanki, eches phulka ke baad sukhpal khera kaa istipha, loksabhaa chunaav se pehle aam aadmi party ke lihaaj se sahi nahin he
 Sukhpal Singh Khaira also alleged that the party had "completely deviated" from the ideology and principles on which it was formed after the Anna Hazare movement
 party virdohi gatividhiyon main sanliptata ke chalate pichley saal november main party se nilambit kiye gaye khera ne apana tyaagptr aap ke rashtriya sanyojak arvind kejariwal ko bhej diya he
 The MLA from Bolath said in his resignation, “the current political culture of the traditional parties of the country has deteriorated due to which a lot of expectations were raised with the formation of AAP
 ” khera ne kaha, “durbhaagya se party main shaamil hone ke baad maine mahasoos kiya ki aap kaa padakram bhi paaramparik kendrikrut raajnneetik partiyon se alag nahin he
 "he has been a vocal critic of the AAP leadership since he was removed from the post of Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly in July last year

 The manner in which Africa lost to india-a team in a practice match convinced the fans of India that India would win in T20 matches
 1) shandaar record - tii20 main da
 India's record against Africa has been excellent, with 8 T20 matches played between the two in which India has won 6
 bharat main pehali baar donon timen tii20 match main takaraaengi Both the teams have come face to face in the World Cup 5 times but the Proteas have lost 4 times at the hands of India
 2) chokars kaa tag - da
 Africa has been tagged with chokers for years and the team has not been able to prove it wrong even after getting a chance
 bharat ke khilaadi bhi da
 We want to take advantage of this weakness by pressuring Africa
 3) laajawab bhartiya ballebaazi - jis team main rohit sharma, shikhar dhawan, viraat kohli, emes dhoni ou suresh raina jaise ballebaaz hon us team ke liye sabase chote formet main kamyaabi hasil karnaa koi badi baat nahin
 All these people are considered the King of T20 and everyone is a match winner on his day

 vishwa cap main donon timen aamane saamne 5 baar ai hai lekin 4 baar bharat ke haathon protiyaaz ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 2) Tag of chokers - The
 africa par saalon se chokars kaa tag laga hua he or kai baar mauqaa milane par bhi team ise galat sabit nahin kar pai he
 India's players too
 africa par dabaav banaakar unki isi kamazori kaa faaydaa uthaanaa chaahate hai
 3) Great Indian batting - Achieving success in the shortest format is not a big deal for a team that has batsmen like Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina

 After four precise predictions about the FIFA World Cup, Shaheen's two consecutive predictions have proved to be wrong
 mexico or brazil ke bich drow va portugal kii haar ke baad dubai ke is oont ne ab spain par daanv lagaaya he
 Shaheen had put a hat-trick of right predictions, so now the wrong predictions will also be hat-tricked? According to Shaheen's prediction on Tuesday, Brazil was supposed to win in Brazil Vs Mexico match, but the game between the two teams was on par
 isse pehle somvaar ko shaheen kii 5veen bhavishyavaanee galat sabit ho gai thi
 Portugal suffered a severe defeat from Germany
 mangalvaar ko bhavishyavaanee karne ke dauraan shaheen ke andaaj main maayusi dekhi gai thi, jo abhi bhi jari he!abaki baar spain par lagaaya daanvabuudhvaar ko shaheen kii taaja bhavishyavaanee kaa jo video saamne aayaa usamen bhi shaheen ke andaaj main berukhi saaf dikhaai detii he
 Shaheen has bet on Spain for the World Cup match between Spain and Chile
 bhavishyavaanee ke dauraan shaheen ne aaj bhi apni pasand chunane main utsaah nahin dikhaaya, jabaki abhi tak vah apni pasand kii team ke board ko daanton tale dabaakar use hawa main uthaa letaa tha
 Significantly, out of 6 prophecies so far, Shaheen's initial four predictions have proved to be absolutely correct
 shaheen ne ravivaar ko bhavishyavaanee kii thi ki argentina banaam bosnia or harjegovinia ke bich match main argentina kii jeet hogi
 The victory of Italy on Saturday night and the victory of Brazil and the Netherlands before that gave strength to Shaheen
 baharhaal, ummid he ki spain kii jeet hogi or shaheen ke utsaah main vaapasi hogi
 At the moment, the situation is such that this camel is difficult to understand its own position

 chipko andolan ke aaj 45 saal puure hone par search ingine google ne doodle banaakar yaad kiya he
 This movement started in Uttarakhand in 1974 to protect trees
 chipko andolan kii ek mukhya baat ye thi ki isamen mahilaon ne baari sankhya main bhaag liya tha
 As shown in the doodle, how women are trying to save them around trees like they did during the movement
 ye andolan uttarakhand se shuru hokar puure desh main fail gaya tha
 Let me tell you, in 1973, under the leadership of Gaura Devi, women clung to the trees to save them from cutting down trees
 is andolan ke madhyam se unhone wanon par apana paramparaagat adhikaar jataayaa tha
 This movement was widely given by environmentalists Sundarlal Bahuguna and Chandiprasad Bhatt
 yahaan lagaataar 9 ghante tak dikhaa indradhanush, bana vishwa recordjane andolan kii shuruuaat ke bare main
 
 
 On 26 March 1974, the 'chipko Movement' to stop felling of trees started
 us saal jab uttarakhand ke rani gaanv ke jangal ke lagbhag dhai hajaar pedo ko kaatane kii nilaamee hui, to gaura devi naam kii mahila ne anya mahilaon ke saath pedo kii nilaamee kaa virodh kiya
 Despite this, the decision of the government and the contractor did not change
 jab thekedaar ke aadmi ped kaatane pahunche, to gaura devi or unke 21 saathiyon ne un logon ko samajhane kii koshish kii
 When they insisted on cutting the trees, the women clung to the trees and challenged them to first cut us and then cut these trees
 ye hai duniya ke sabase chote 10 desh, 1 hajaar se kam he jansankhyamahilaon ke virodh ke aage thekedaar ko jhukna padaa
 Later, these women spoke before the officials of the local forest department
 jiske baad rani gaanv kaa jangal nahin kaata gaya
 Thus 'chipko Andolan' started here
 inaki vajah se shuru hua andolnavahin andolan ke dauraan paanchavin class tak padhi gaura devi kii paryaavaran vigyaan kii samaj or unki sooyeeboojh ne apane seene ko bandook ke aage kar ke, apni jaan par khel kar, jo kaam kiya, usne unhen sirf rani gaanv kaa hi nahin, uttarakhand kaa hi nahin, balki puure desh kaa hero bana diya tha
 She came to be called 'chipko Woman from India' abroad
 chipko andolan' ek adivasee aurat gaura devi ke adamya saahas or sooyeeboojh kii daastaan he
 This is the world's most expensive chocolate, the price was Rs 6 lakh after the movement
in Uttar Pradesh, this movement won a big victory in 1980 when the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi stopped the felling of trees in the Himalayan forests of the state for 15 years
 Was applied
 baad ke saalon main yah andolan uttar main himachal pradesh, dakshin main karnataka, pashchim main rajasthan, purv main bihar or madhya bharat main failaa
 This movement was successful in stopping the felling of trees
 saath hi yah logon kii aavashyaktaaon or paryaavaran ke prati adhik sachet prakritik sansaadhan niti ke liye dabaab banane main bhi safal rahaa
 At the same time, if we talk about this movement, even today trees are being chopped down
 moulana gulam mohammad vastanvi saat maheene pehle baari ummiido or oonche lakshyon ke saath devbandi masalak kii sarvocch shikshan sanstha daarul ulum devband ke mohatamim banaae gaye the
 The forced manner in which the liberal and progressive Aalim Maulana Vastanvi of Gujarat was removed from there is equally as sensational
 yahaan ke islamic halkon ke khaas jaankaron ko bhi puraa khel samajhne main vakt lagegaa
 To find out what Maulana Vastanvi had to say about the entire controversy and the decision to remove himself, Surendra Singhal spoke to him shortly after his departure from Darul Uloom and then on his visit to Europe
 har vakt chehre par khili muskaan vaale moulana vastanvi ne badi saadagi, vinamrata or salike se apana najariya pesh kiya
 Here are excerpts from the conversation with him: You have been a member of the organization's Majlis-shura for the last 10 years and where you did not complete the seven months of holding the position of Mohtamim, what happened after that you were forcibly removed? i i run the country's largest educational institution, jamia-islamia Ishatul Uloom in Akkalkuan, Maharashtra
 8 disambar, 2010 ko daarul ulum ke mohatamim moulana murguburrahaman kaa nidhan ho jane ke baad 10 janvari, 2011 ko nae mohatamim kii tainaati ke liye devband main bulaai gai majalise-shura kii baithak main ek maheene se kaaryvahak mohatamim pad par karyrat mufti abul kasim kii jagah majalise-shura ne mujhe mohatamim chunaa tha
 i had neither come ready for this nor was interested in this post
 lekin shura ke sadasyon kii bhaawanaaon or allaah ke hukum kaa paalan karte hue main nai jimmedaari kabool karne ko taiyaar ho gaya
 But the group that came before me did not accept this
 maine kaam shuru bhi nahin kiya tha ki mujhe hataane kii chaalen chalani shuru ho gayi
 Being able to be associated with education and social sector, i could not smell the conspiracies nor did i know their cut
 maine vahaan tikne or kaam karne kii koshish kii lekin aakhirkaar mujhe naapsand karne vaale mere harifon ne mujhe vahaan se jabaran hataa diya
 After all, what do you believe to be the reason behind this? Everyone knows that there is a special lobby in Deoband which i will not name
 ve is sanstha ko apni bapauti samajhte hai
 They have tremendous dominance there
 unki marji ke bagaiyr vahaan patta bhi nahin kharag saktaa
 When i sat there, those people started to see danger in their existence
 mere saamne un logon kii chamak feeki padane lagi or devband main bhi unke bajaae meraa shor sunai dene laga, jo unhen ganvaara nahin hua
 It is the lobby that has removed me from the conspiracy

 What is your objection to the inquiry committee? i called a ruckus meeting on 23 February to keep all the cases in Shura
 usamen mere prastaav par shura kii teen sadasyeey jaanch cameti banaai gai thi

 The investigation report presented at the Shura meeting on 23 July was completely incomplete
 usamen keval mujhse jude ek mudde kii hi jaanch kii gai or baaki donon sawaalon ko chhod diya gaya
 i and other colleagues objected to this
 adhuri jaanch report kii vajah se main apane elaan ke mutabik istipha dene ko taiyaar nahin tha
 i also said in the meeting that they should get the other two issues investigated and if its results come out, then i will leave this post
 par shura ke zyaadaatar sadsy iske liye raji na hue or isi vajah se main istipha nahin dene par ada rahaa
 Do you agree with the procedure adopted by Shura in the removal of you? Members associated with a special lobby of Shura, in order to fulfill their masters' deletion of me, put me on hold by holding Darul Uloom's Dastur (iin) i

 But i also accepted Shura's decision to maintain the dignity and prestige of Darul Uloom
 aap udaar islamic vidwaan or shikshavid hai
 In such a situation what do you intend to do now? i have decided not to go to court
 main is mudde ko lekar janata ke bich bhi nahin jaaoongaa
 i have my own big madrasa
 vahaan mere liye badi bhoomika he
 i will look at that work again and carry on
 main nahin maanata ki daarul ulum jaisi muslimon kii badi sanstha ko lekar kisi tarah kaa koi vivaad paidaa kiya jaae
 i will continue to be a member of Darul Uloom's Shura and as a member will continue to serve this institution as before
 kya aap sochate hai ki aaj devband main kisi udaar muslim vidwaan or prashaasak ke liye koi jagah nahin he?jo suluk mere saath hua he, usase yah spasht he ki ek khaas lobby kii marji ke bina vahaan kisi ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 i was not given a chance to work there and was punished without any mistake
 aisa kiya janaa nyaay, naitikta, majahab or tark kisi bhi lihaaj se sahi nahin he par aisa kiya gaya or yah ek sarvocch dini sanstha ke ulmaae deen kii taraf se hua he jiskaa mujhe behad afsos he
 Do you think you have fallen prey to the conspiracies of conservatives and anti-change opponents? i do not believe that Darul Uloom is occupied by conservatives or fundamentalists
 main kah chukaa hum ki daarul ulum par ek vishesh gut kaa kabja he jahaan unki manamaani chalati he
 i have fallen prey to the conspiracies of the same group, which had stood before me from the beginning
 narendra modi or gujarat ko lekar aapane apane pehle ke jo bayaan badale the, ab badali hui paristhitiyon main us bare main aap kya sochate hai?maine narendra modi or gujarat ke vikaas ko lekar surat (gujarat) main ek angreji akhbaar ke numaayinde ko jo intervyuu diya tha, us par main hameshaa kaayam rahaa
 In fact, the things i denied were printed by a section of the Urdu press, distraught and at the behest of a particular faction, about my interview
 maine media main kai baar jor dekar kaha he ki shuru main us akhbaar ke numaayinde se maine jo kuch bolaa tha usne hu-ba-hu vahi chapa tha
 But unfortunately my words were taken otherwise
 main siyaasi halake kaa aadmi nahin hum, shiksha kshetra se hum
 i do not know the meaning of political arguments
 main apni baton se kabhi phiraa nahin hum
 Are you still up to your original statement? i have answered your question
 kya aap maanate hai ki devband (daarul ulum) kaa prashasan kattarpanthi takaton ne hathiyaa liya he?us par kattarpathiyon kaa nahin, jaisaa ki main pehle kah chukaa hum, ek khaas gut (lobby) kaa kabja or varchasv he
 Being a liberal Islamic scholar and educationist, what will be the mutual role now

 supreme court dilli sarkaar kii arji par shuukravaar ko sunwaayee karegaa
 The Delhi government has filed 6 petitions
 supreme court main dilli hoicourt ke faisle ko dilli sarkaar ne chunauti di he
 In its petition, the Delhi government has claimed that after this decision, the situation has become mediocre

 In the matter of authority between the Delhi government and the Center, the Kejriwal government had withdrawn the suit i
e

 The Delhi government had told the Supreme Court that the decision of the Delhi High Court has been challenged on 1 August
 is maamle main supreme court main 6 yachikaayen daakhil kii gai hai
 Now the decision of the Delhi High Court has been challenged by the Delhi Government
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki hoicourt ke faisle se loktantric vyavastha palat jaaegi jo sanvaidhanik tareeke se dilli ko ek chuni hui vidhansabha ke saath rajya kaa darja detii he
 The Chief Minister of Delhi is accountable to the Legislative Assembly and not to the Lieutenant Governor

 Actually, this petition was filed by the Delhi government in April

 The comments pichhali sunwaayee main supreme court ne dilli sarkaar se kaha tha ki wo dilli hoicourt ke faisle ko chunauti de or is yachika ko waapas le kyonki do maamle ek saath nahin chal sakate
 However, on Wednesday, the Delhi government has filed a petition against the High Court's decision
 vahiin dilli hoicourt ne dilli sarkaar ko jhatka dete hue kaha tha ki uparajyapal (LG) hi dilli ke prashaasak he
 Actually, there is a provision under 131 in the constitution that if there is a dispute between the Center and the state or between the states, only the Supreme Court can hear
 apni yachika main dilli sarkaar ne daawa kiya he ki is faisle ke baad halaat asaadharan ho gaye hai
 Delhi government officials are thinking that they have to report to the lieutenant governor instead of the minister and they are doing the same

 In this case 6 petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court
 ab dilli hoicourt ke faisle ko dilli sarkaar ne chunauti di he
 The petition said that the High Court's decision would overturn the democratic system which constitutionally gives Delhi the status of state with an elected assembly
 dilli ke mukhyamantri vidhansabha ke prati javabdeh hai naa ki uparajyapal ke prati
 The Anti Corruption Bureau should be in the hands of the Delhi government or else the government will have to face criticism

 The Delhi government had demanded that the rights of the Center and the Delhi government should be settled and Delhi should get full state-like rights

 However, the Supreme Court had questioned the Delhi government's filing of suit under 131 and said how can you call yourself a state
 tippaniyan In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Delhi government to challenge the decision of the Delhi High Court and withdraw this petition as the two cases cannot run simultaneously
 haalanki buudhvaar ko hi dilli sarkaar hoicourt ke faisle ke khilaaf yachika daakhil kar di he
 At the same time, the Delhi High Court had given a shock to the Delhi government, saying that the Lieutenant Governor (LG) is the administrator of Delhi
 darasal samvidhan main 131 ke tahat praavdhaan he ki yadi centre or rajya ke bich yaa rajyon ke bich koi vivaad ho to supreme court hi sunwaayee kar saktaa he

 ek dress kii khariddaari ke dauraan uske rang ko lekar chali do doston or parivaar waalon kii bahes se internet kii duniya sanasanaane lagi
 After four days of debate on Twitter, Facebook, Bajfeed, Washington Post, US magazine, hundreds of fashion bloggers and news websites around the world, it has been found out what the real color of the dress was
 dress kaa asli rang blue or blike hi he
 In such a big question, why do millions of people see this dress was golden and white
 kya ek saath itane logon ke dekhne kii kshamta main antar sambhav he
 Many experts related to neuro, eye and optics have started investigating this interesting case and started giving their results
 kai visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki agar tasviir ko overexpored kiya jaae to uske rang ko lekar logon ke nazariye main antar sambhav he
 Mark Fairchild, director of the Program of Color Science Department of the Rochester Institute of Technology, has stated that the blue and black color of this photo on the Internet was hidden because the image was taken very close and the light was coming from behind it
 mark ke sahyogi raay burns kii raay main agar is dress kii tasviir ko thodi duuri se liya jaataa to yah blue or blike hi najar aata
 At the same time, due to the variation in the number of photorespirators in the eye's retina, called cones, people are able to see the same color differently, according to Duje Tadin, a professor of brain and cognitive science at Rackster University
 insaani ankhon ke retina main saath lakh cone hote hai jo hare, laal or blue rang ke prati samvedansheel hote hai
 The brain recognizes color based on the signal from these cones
 dow tadin ne is masale par neuyark times se apni baatcheet main kaha he- blue rang ke maamle main aisa hota he, kyonki hamaare retina main blue rang kii samvedansheeltaa vaale cone sabase kam hote hai, aise blue rang safed rang ke kareeb dikhataa he
 Stephen Westland, a professor of color science and technology at Leeds University, told the BBC that the illusion that this dress has been taken is of a bizarre nature, leading to a situation of confusion

 kai logon ke man main yah sawaal uthaa hoga ki andhrapradesh ke tateey hisson main tabaahi machaane vaale tufaan kaa naam ‘laila’ kaise padaa
 Perhaps the answer lies with Pakistan
 bhartiya mausam vibhaag (iemdi) ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki jab vishwa mausam sanghathan ne iemdi ko hind mahaasaagar main aane vaale tufaanon par najar rakhane or uskaa naam rakhane kii jimmedaari saunpi to pakistan ne iemdi ko ‘laila’ naam sujhaayaa
 Meteorologists began the tradition of naming them for easy identification and analysis of storm mechanisms
 ab tufaanon ke naam vishwa mausam sanghathan dwaara taiyaar prakriya ke anusaar rakhe jate hai
 The official said that the storms that formed over the Bay of Bengal and over the Arabian Sea started being named since 2004
 kshetreey visheshikrut mausam centre hone kii vajah se iemdi bharat ke alaava saat anya deshon bangladesh, maldive, myama, oman, pakistan, thailand tathaa srilanka ko mausam sambandhi paraamarsh jari karata he
 According to the official, IMD has also asked these countries to suggest names for the storms
 in deshon ne angreji varnmaala ke kram ke anusaar naamon kii suchi di
 For the purpose of providing specific identification for the issuance of forecasts and warnings, 64 names were suggested out of which 22 have been used so far
 chakra ke anusaar, is tufaan ke liye ‘laila’ naam pakistan ne sujhaayaa tha
 The next storm will be named "bandu", which was suggested by Sri Lanka
 mukhya uttari hind mahaasaagar ushn katibandheey mausam may se november tak rahata he or is mausam kaa pehla tufaan naragis tha
 The tradition of naming storms has been going on since the early 20th century when an Australian expert named big storms after politicians he didn't like
 america mausam vibhaag ne 1953 se tufaanon ke naam rakhane shuru kiye
 This trend in the subcontinent began in 2004
 adhikari ne bataaya ki naam rakhe jane se mausam visheshgyon kii, ek hi samay main kisi basin par ek se adhik tufaanon ke sakriy hone par, bhram kii sthiti bhi dur ho gai
 Names of devastating storms are changed each year and new names are replaced by old ones
