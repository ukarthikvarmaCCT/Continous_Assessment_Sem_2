 But on the issue of religious harmony in India, he also suggested signs
 unhone kaha ki bharat agar dharmik aadhaar par na bante, to vah kaamyaab hota rahegaa
 He said this while referring to the diversity of India and America in 20 key points of Obama's speech
 unhone kaha, 'bharat or america main hindu, musalmaan, isai, sikh, yahudee, buddha or jain rahete hai
 Every person is free to practice his faith without any harassment, fear or discrimination
 bharat safal hota rahegaa, jab tak vah dharmik shraddha ke aadhaar par na bante
 He also asked for the protection of citizens' identities without any discrimination

 com / vpbsbufqk0 karnataka main vidhansabha chunaav kaa prachaar jari he or bijepi, congress, jedies sahit tamaam partiyaan zyada se zyada votaron ko apni ore lubhaane main juty hai
 However, if we look at the figures of previous elections, then it shows that there is no special pattern of voting in the state nor any single party has unitary rule in the entire state
 raajnneetik partiyon kaa yahaan alag-alag vot bank or prabhaav kshetra he
 One such area is Bombay Karnataka
 is ilaake main congress jahaan apana purana record kaayam rakhana chaahati he, vahiin bijepi 2008 ke nattejey dohraane ko betaab he
 Out of total 224 assembly seats in Karnataka, there are 50 seats under Secombe Karnataka region
 bombai karnataka ke kshetra main haveri, dharwar, belgaum, bijapur, hubli, bagalkot or gadag jile aate hai
 Both BJP and Congress parties have high expectations from the caste equations in the region
 bijepi ke paramparaagat vot bank lingayat samudaay ke vot apni ore karne ke liye congress ne unki alag dharm ke darje kii maang maanakar bada game khelaa he
 Whereas BJP has declared BS Yeddyurappa as CM candidate to help Lingayats
 iske alaava dalit maton par donon partiyaan baraabar kii daavedaari kar rahi hai
 However, in the last election, Dalits voted in favor of the Congress
 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bombai karnataka ke tahat aane vaali50 siton main se congress ne 30 sitonper jeet darj kii thi
 At the same time, BJP got 15 seats and JDS got only one seat
 iske alaava anya ko 4 siten mili thim
 In terms of vote percentage, the Congress got 38 percent votes, BJP 27 percent, JDS 11 percent and others 10 percent votes in this area
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav ke ek saal ke baad hi 2014 main hue loksabhaa chunaav main is kshetra kaa sameekaran puri tarah se badal gaya
 The BJP stood at number one with 51 percent votes
 jabaki congress ko yahaan se 43 pratishat vot mili
 However, a big reason for this was that while Yeddyurappa was fighting a separate party in the assembly elections, he had returned to the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon kii matdaan pravriti ko dekhen to bijepi 39 vidhansabha siton par number ek par rahi
 While the Congress was ahead on 11
 bijepi loksabhaa chunaav kii tarah se congress virdohi rujhaan kii ummid paale hue he or is kshetra main camel khilaane kii jugat main he
 Three BJP stalwarts from Karnataka come from this region
 purv mukhyamantri jagadish shetter hubli se vidhayak hai
 Former state president of the party Prahlad Joshi is a resident of Dharwad
 iske alaava kendriya mantri ramesh jigajigani bijapur se taalluk rakhte hai
 The BJP feels that like 2008, Yeddyurappa, who ruled the Lingayat voters unilaterally, will rekindle
 party maan kar chal rahi he ki use kshetra kii 50 siton main se 30 se zyada par jeet milegi
 While the Congress is struggling to repeat its previous record

" mujhe koi haq nahin he ki main kahuun ki aap galat hai yaa phir ye hai, wo hai
 "comments apni abhinay kshamta ke liye kaaphi sammaan paane vaale palekar ne kaha, "agar main apni asahmati jataata hum to kya main isse turant raashtra virdohi ho jaataa hum? agar maine aisa purvavarti sarkaar ke saath kiya tha, to mujhe maujuuda sarkaar ke saamne bhi khud ko abhivyakt karne kaa haq he
 " palekar ne kaha, "sensorship ke maamle main main maharashtra kii sabhi sarkaron se lard chukaa hum, chaahe vah congress kii rahi ho, shivasena kii rahi ho yaa kisi or kii
 Therefore, i believe that people should have the right to protest, the right to express dissent and it should be respected at all costs
 " Palekar said on Thursday, "if an artist feels that he can protest by returning his award, then what is so excited and disturbing? If i feel that i would like this or some other way If i can express my opposition with this, then it should be respected
 " He said, "I have always condemned the suppression of anyone's voice
" agar kisi naatak ko pratibandhit kiya jaataa he, koi film roki jaati he to maine hameshaa isaki ninda kii he
 Whether i like that film or not is a completely different issue

 As far as freedom of expression is concerned, every person should get this freedom

 uttar pradesh kii yogi adityanath sarkaar ne pradooshan ko dhyaan main rakhte hue polithine par bain laga diya he
 Yogi Adityanath himself is also following this plastic ban campaign completely
 yun to 15 july se polithine bain ho chukaa he or charanbaddh tareeke se oktober tak sabhi tarah ke polithine or zyaadaatar plastic bain ho jaaenge lekin plastic bain karne kii ek kadi shuruyaat yogi adityanath ne khud se kii he
 Now in the government meetings of Yogi Adityanath, steel flasks are seen instead of bottled mineral water
 plastic ke botalon main band pani kii jagah ab yogi adityanath kii sarkari meeting main steel ke flask rakhe ja rahe hai taaki sarkari str par sandesh saaf-saaf diya ja sake ki polithine or plastic ab bardaasht nahin kiya jayega
 The Chief Minister started using steel flasks in meetings with government officials from Tuesday and the photographs show that Yogi Adityanath's gesture is now clear
 yogi adityanath ke saath ek or cheez judati he ki unki pasand or naapsand donon trend ban jate hai, masalan bhagava ke prati unke pyaar ne puure pradesh main bhagavakaran kii ek muhim paidaa kar di thi or adhikari se lekar janpratinidhi tak, sabane sabakuch bhagava rangana shuru kar diya tha, plastic ko lekar agar aisa hi trend chalaa to yogi adityanath ko chaabuk chalaane kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Although the government has not taken any decision regarding the mineral water locked in plastic, but the use of steel flask instead of plastic bottles is enough to convey the message in the government meeting
 vaise bhi bataa denyogi adityanathke ghar main hone vaali zyaadaatar partiyon main polithine, plastic kaa istemaal nahin ke baraabar hota he or yogi khud ke liye steel ke bartanon kaa istemaal hi karte rahe hai
 Although the High Court has already ordered polythene ban, but it was never strictly enforced
 yogi adityanath ne ise gambhirtha se liya he or wo polithine bain ko kadai se lagu karne ke mood main hai ab dekhnaa he yogi kii sandesh dene kii koshish plastic bain par kitna asar dikhaata he

 Emphasis is placed on the creation of a human being on the strength of rites
 'satyapal singh ne kaha ki 'ham sabhi praaniyon ko mitra kii drushti se dekhen, isliye hamaare yahaan kabhi bhi maanav adhikaar kii baat nahin kii gai, keval kartavya kii baat kii gai he

 zyaadaatar filmein unhone sani deol ke saath nirdeshit kii hai
 Now he has produced the film Genius with his son Utkarsh in the lead role

 During this time, he meets Nandini (ishita Chauhan), a college love affair

 kahani main bahut saare twist or turn aate hai or antat kya hota he yah jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Weak link: The film's weak link is its story, direction, screenplay along with a length of about three to three hours
 is sadi ke hisaab se kahani bahut hi kamjor he or jis tarah se filmakan kiya gaya he usamen koi nayaapan nahin he
 The songs coming from time to time make its story even weaker

 The climax of the film is also of a very old type

 Know why you can watch the film, Utkarsh needs to become more expert in the field of acting
 haalanki pehali film ke hisaab se unhone acha kaam kiya he
 They have to bear the brunt of the story
 agar aapkonvazuddinis film ke trailor main pasand aaye hai, to aap tri kar sakate hai

 People used to think that if they have chosen Kikjariwal, then cleaning up is also Kejriwal's job
 ab janata ne bijepi ko chunaa he lekin isse pehle bijepi ne janata ko sirf gumraah kiya he
 i hope the BJP will leave politics and focus on cleanliness
 iske alaava emsidi ko aawaara kutton, parkon kii safai, parkon main lite or footpath thik karne kii zarurat he
 When the minister was asked whether the Delhi government was also making a plan for cleanliness, Satyendra Jain said clearly that the work of the urban department is not to be cleaned

 (students at the Ashoka University Campus in Sonipat, Hariyama) What is the problem of Liberal Education? The talk of Nalanda and ancient Rome is well in place, but the way we know and understand Liberal Arts today is the gift of America

 After ten years of teaching in National Law Schools, Sudhir Krishnaswamy, now a teacher at Azim Premji University, feels that there was no scope of interaction between subjects in those institutions

 Many private education institutions of Liberal Arts are looking to give scholarships to students who are needing to balance their sense of social service and get full price from the rest

 Rajnath Singh and Venkaiah Naidu, members of the three-member committee set up by BJP President Amit Shah, met Congress President Sonia Gandhi and other leaders of the opposition on Friday to build consensus on the presidential election
 bijepi netaaon ne apni party ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi se bhi bhent kii or donon netaaon se raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar charchaa kii
 The BJP asked the opposition the name of the candidate Rajnath and Venkaiah Naidu met all the leaders of the opposition, including Sonia Gandhi, and asked him the name of the candidate for the presidency, but did not open his cards
 is par vipaksh ne bhi rajnath singh or venkaiya naidu par chutki lee ki jinhen apni party kii taraf se raashtrapati ummidavaar kaa naam nahin pataa hai, wo hamase puch rahe hai ki aap suzav de ki kise ummidavaar bananaa chahie
 This general meeting was not meant to form a consensus on the presidential candidate, but for courtesy
 adwani-joshi se naam sujhane ko kahadilachasp ye he ki rajnath singh or venkaiya naidu ne jis andaaj vipaksh ke saamne ye sawaal rakhaa ki unka ummidavaar koun hai? bilkul usee andaaj main laalkrishna adwani or murali manohar joshi se poocha ki kisi behatar ummidavaar kaa naam sujhaayen
 If sources are to be believed, the two senior leaders clearly stated that they do not have any names in front of them
 aam sahmati banane ke naam par shishtacharik mulaakaat kar bijepi netritv ye sandesh dena chahta hai ki wo aam sahmati bananaa chaahate the, lekin vipaksh iske liye taiyaar nahin tha or majaburi main chunaav karana padaa
 While Murali Manohar Joshi gave a 5 point framework, the Murli Manohar Joshi has placed five frames in front of Rajnath Singh and Venkaiah Naidu for the presidential candidate
 1
 The presidential candidate should be political
 2
 Agree with the party's ideology
 3
 Can put the party's views and government policies internationally
 4
 The Prime Minister was able to carry forward the work with Narendra Modi
 5
 Whatever the candidate is, the Sangh agrees
 joshi ne kaha ki agar ye frem rakhkar naam tay kiya jayega, to desh ko behatar raashtrapati milegaa
 Outside the advani-joshi race, the BJP as well as the two senior leaders of the BJP meet LK Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi and ask them to suggest who might be a better name for the presidential candidate
 iskaa matlab saaf he ki in donon netao ko raashtrapati or uparashtrapati kii res se baahar kar diya gaya he
 If these two leaders were to make candidates, then who could be better candidates than them
 is par naam nahin puche jate

 Will be done

 Apart from this, fighting was done on the basis of sharp and weighing weapons

 " Some student activists assaulted an assistant professor in the music department of the University of Allahabad by expelling him from his home
 chaatro kaa aarope he ki unhone shikshak ko vishvavidhyalay kii ek chaatra ke saath aapattijanak haalat main paaya

 The comments yah ghatana shuukravaar kii he, jab chaatr kaaryakartaaon kaa ek samooh shikshak ke ghar main ghus gaya or unhen kathith taur par ek ladki ke saath aapattijanak haalat main paaya

 com / o4tcvity2e Explain that soon after joining BJP, Sunny Deol has been given ticket from Gurdaspur in Punjab
 gurdaspur main sani deol (sunny Deol) kaa muqabla kagress ke sunil jakhad se hoga
 Sunil Jakhar is the current MP and son of veteran Congress leader and former Union Minister Balram Jakhar
 bijepi main shaamil hone ke baad sani deol (sunny Deol BJP) ne kaha tha ki jis tarah se mere papa is parivaar ke saath jude the
 He worked with Atal ji
 main modi ji ke saath judaa hum, main modi ji se judane aayaa hum
 Today, the way Modi ji has worked in five years, so i want Modi ji to be the PM for the next five years
 kyonki ham vikaas chaahate hai
 i will serve this family
 udhar, gurdaspur loksabhaa kshetra se abhinayta sani deol ko chunaav maidan main utaare jane se pareshaan purv kendriya mantri or abhinayta vinod khanna kii vidhwaa kavita khanna ne kaha ki vah mahasoos karti hai ki unhen tyaag diya gaya he or khaarij kar diya gaya he, kyonki aakhri ghadi main unhen tikat se vanchit kar diya gaya
 She also clarified that she will not contest as an independent candidate
 kavita ne gurdaspur se unki ummidavaari par gaur nahin karne par bhaajapa par unke saath vishwasghaat karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Vinod Khanna represented this Lok Sabha constituency four times
 unhone kaha, 'maine mahasoos kiya ki mujhe tyaag diya gaya he or khaarij kar diya gaya he
 i was made to feel absolutely insignificant
 party se kisi ne bhi yah kehane ke liye mujhase baat nahin kii ki doosraa ummidavaar he

 Bones are also helpful for storing minerals like calcium and phosphorus and for speeding up muscles
 bachapan se lekar buudhe hone tak kii avasthaa main inamen kai tarah ke badlaav aate hai
 By the age of 30, bone mass density has reached its peak, after which the volume of this mass begins to decrease gradually in the bones compared to the aggregation, leading to the condition of osteoporosis, which develops as we age
 It happens with isamen asthiyaan kamjor va bhangur ho jaati hai
 In this case, if the bone is broken due to any reason, then it becomes very difficult to join them back
 aankadon ke hisaab se 50 saal se adhik umr ke vyaktiyon main haddiyon ke aasaani se tut jane kii pravriti hoti he
 One in two women and one in four men have bone fractures simply because they are suffering from osteoporosis
 aise main inaki sahi dekhbhaal bahut jaruri he
 There are many risk factors that cause people to fall prey to this disease before time
 dainik aahaar main calcium yaa vitamin di main kami, kam shaareerik gatividhi, vajan kaa behad kam hona, nashe kaa seven, hormone kaa aniyamit str or kuch nishchit dawaaiyon kaa seven osteoporosis ko vakt se pehle daavat de saktaa he
 Additional director of bone department at Fortis Escorts Hospital in Faridabad, Dr
 harish ghutaa ne jinavastylee se sambandhit kuch baaten saajha kii hai, jo haddiyon ke swasthya ko behatar banane main hamaari madad karengi
 - Including foods rich in calcium and vitamin d is a good step
 jaise ki kam vasayukta dugdh utpaada yani tofu yaa soya milk, hari patteydaar subjiyan, faliyaan, saiman (ek prakaar kii machhlee), baadaam ityadi ko apane dainik aahaar main jarur len
 Show the body two to three times a week for ten to fifteen minutes of sunlight, because sunlight is a good source of vitamin D
 iske alaava fortyphid doodh, anaaj, saiman, toona machhlee, zinga yaa oastor main bhi vitamin di kii acchhee maatra pai jaati he
 Do regular physical exercise for at least half an hour
 isse haddiyaan or mansapeshiyaan majboot hoti hai
 Abandon tobacco or alcohol consumption

 India has approached the International Court of Justice to ban the hanging of former Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav in Pakistan and for counselor access
 court ke chif roni abraham ne is maamle main pakistan ke pradhanmantri ko chitti bhi likhi he
 Some questions have arisen in this whole issue
 pehla sawaal he ki kya ye maamla ICJ ke daayre main aata he
 The answer comes because both India and Pakistan have signed a protocol in this matter
 ye hai
 
 
 Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, 1963
 is par bharat ne november 1977 main dastakhat kiye to pakistan ne march 1976 main
 And according to this, if there is a dispute about it, the ICJ will have the right to settle it
 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the 1963 ek antarrashtriya samjhauta he, jiske tahat ek desh kaa naagarik agar duusare desh main bandi hota he to use apane desh ke ucchayog yaa duutavas ke adhikariyon se milane kaa adhikaar hoga
 Pakistan has so far been stating on the basis of a bilateral agreement between itself and India that it has the right to grant access or not, but India is calling it a violation of international laws
 16 baar bharat counslar acces maang chukaa he par mila ek baar bhi nahin
 
 or is bich pakistan kii military court ne jadhav ko maut kii sazaa suna di
 After this, the question is arising that can ICJ ban Jadhav's execution without any hearing? In fact, under Article 74, Para 4 of the rules of the ICJ, the Chief of the ICJ can make such a request to any member country
 ye kanoonee taur par lagu hota he
 Under this, it is being told that French Judge Ronnie Abraham, who is currently the Chief Judge of the ICJ, has written a letter to the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif to stop the execution of Jadhav
 ab sawaal ye ki kya is tarah se ICJ jane kaa galat asar nahin hoga? kya bhavishya main pakistan ye hi kaam kashmir se jude maamalon main nahin karegaa? iskaa jawaab vahaan mil gaya, jab videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa gopal baagle ne kaha ki ICJ jane kaa faisla bahut soch-samajhakar kiya gaya he
 It simply means that if after 46 years India decided to go to the ICJ, it would certainly have been deeply considered in the ministry and at the highest level and it would have been concluded that going to the ICJ is a better step, because the basis of the appeal Violation of the laws of the Vienna Convention and the provision to go to this court in similar cases
 aage ke liye bhi ye sthiti saaf ho jaaegi ki koun sa samjhauta baari padegaa- dwipaksheeya yaa antarrashtriya
 The comments sawaal ye bhi he ki bhartiya sena ke adhikari saurabh kaaliya kii yatnaa or hatya ke liye bharat kyon ICJ nahin gaya
 In 2015, Justice Mani VS Mani, appearing for the government in the Supreme Court, said that the matter does not come under the purview of the ICJ, as per India's Declaration of September 18, 1974 (1) Dispute between Commonwealth countries is out of scope
 (2) dushmani, ladaai, aatmaraksha se jude vivaad bhi iske daayre main nahin
 (3) Disputes arising out of all agreements in which all parties are not part of the agreement or the government does not agree on it
 or ab aakhri sawaal, kya pakistan ICJ ke nirdesh ko maanegaa? aam taur par jab desh antarrashtriya samjhauton ke hissaa hote hai to adeshon ko maananaa kanoonee bandhan hota he, lekin pakistan main vahaan kii sena kaa faisla aakhri hota he ye hamane kai maamalon main dekha he
 Even if the Sharif government wants to agree, will the army allow it? Will the government be able to convince the army that what can be the harm of stepping back from such agreements and what are the advantages of accepting it? Only time can tell this

 Even if the Sharif government wants to agree, will the army allow it? Will the government be able to convince the army that what can be the harm of stepping back from such agreements and what are the advantages of accepting it? Only time can tell this
 iske baad sawaal ye uth rahaa he ki bina koi sunwaayee hue kya ICJ jadhav kii faansee par roak laga saktaa he? asal main ICJ ke niyamon ke hi artical 74, para 4 ke tahat ICJ ke chif kisi bhi sadsy desh se aisa anurodh kar sakate hai
 It is legally applicable
 isi ke tahat bataaya ja rahaa he ki france ke jaj roni abraham, jo philhal ICJ ke chif jaj hai, ne pakistan ke pradhanmantri nawaz sharif ko chitthee likhakar jadhav kii faansee par roak kii baat kii he
 Now the question is whether going to the ICJ in this way will not have a bad effect? Will Pakistan not do the same thing in future in matters related to Kashmir? The answer was found there, when Foreign Ministry spokesman Gopal Bagle said that the decision to go to the ICJ has been made very thoughtfully
 iskaa sidhaa matlab he ki agar 46 saal baad bharat ne ICJ jane kaa faisla kiya to nishchit taur par is par mantralay main or sabase oonche str par gahan vichaar hua hoga or nishkarsh ye nikaala gaya hoga ki ICJ janaa behatar kadam he, kyonki apil kaa aadhaar vienna kanvension ke kanoonon kaa ulanghan he or aise hi maamalon main is court main jane kaa praavdhaan bhi
 For the future, it will become clear that which agreement will be heavy - bilateral or international
 tippaniyan The question is also why India did not go to ICJ for torture and murder of Indian Army officer Saurabh Kalia
 2015 main supreme court main sarkaar kaa paksh rakhte hue nyayavid vies mani ne kaha tha ki ye maamla ICJ ke daayre main nahin aata, kyonki bharat ke 18 sitambar, 1974 ke diclaration ke mutabik (1) kaamanwealth deshon ke bich vivaad daayre se baahar he
 (2) Disputes related to enmity, fighting, self-defense are also not under its purview
 (3) un sabhi samjhauton se upje vivaad jisamen sabhi paksh samjhaute kaa hissaa nahin hai yaa is par sarkaar kii sahmati na ho
 And now the last question, will Pakistan accept the ICJ directive? Normally, when countries are part of international agreements, it is a legal obligation to obey orders, but the decision of the army there in Pakistan is the last, we have seen this in many cases
 sharif sarkaar agar maananaa bhi chaahe to kya sena use maanane degi? kya sarkarsena ko samajhane main safal ho paaegi ki aise samjhauton se peeche kadam khinchne kaa nuksaan kya ho saktaa he or maanane ke phaayde kya? ye to sirf vakt hi bataa saktaa he

 Taking a dig at the Congress and Kejriwal during the conversation, he described Modi as the best candidate for the post of PM
 sawaal- kejariwal ne modi or mukesh ambani ke kareebi rishte or gas ke daam par chup rahane ke aarope lagaae hai
 - While answering this question, Ramdev said that there is a difference between Kejriwal's actions and statements
 unki sarkaar par 60 din main bhrashtachar ke aarope lage hai jabaki duusari party ko bhrasht hone main 60 saal lage hai, wo khud vidhaan sabha to chalaa nahin sakate or loksabhaa jane kii baat karte hai
 They do not answer the questions raised on them, and every day the statements keep changing and raise questions on the other

 Kejriwal and Congress are united
 congress ne kejariwal ko kaha he ki tum eemaandaar banakar modi ko bhrashtachari, deshadrohi or beimaan bataao
 Question - Kejriwal had alleged that black money will be brought back with Mukesh Ambani

 The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Saturday raised strong objections to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement against the cow protectionists and said they insulted him by calling him 'anti-social'
 unhone maang kii ki sarkaar unase baatcheet kare
 VHP international working president Pravin Togadia said that Modi's directive to states to prepare dossiers on cow protection is like creating a racial profile of Hindus as they are people who give their lives to protect cows

 Togadia asked Modi to prove his statement that 80 per cent of the guards are engaged in anti-social activities
 vihip ke antarrashtriya kaaryakari adhyaksh praveen togadiya ne kaha ki rajyon ko gorakshakon par dogier taiyaar karne kaa modi kaa nirdesh hinduon kaa nasli profile taiyaar karne jaisaa he kyonki ve aise log hai jo gaayon kii raksha ke liye apni jaan de dete hai
 Expressing 'dissatisfaction and anguish' over the Prime Minister's statement, he questioned why the head of the country gave clean chit to the cow vigilantes and harassed the cow vigilantes who were their ardent supporters and who helped them get elected
 tippaniyan He said that instead of praising the efforts of Hindus in saving cows and having honest conversations with these 'ordinary, non-fancy coworkers', Modi described 80 per cent of them as antisocial
 togadiya ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ’yah na keval gomata balki hinduon or un sabhi kaa apmaan he jo gaayon kii raksha ke liye apni jaan laga dete hai
 Condemning the cow vigilantes, some of whom had assaulted Dalits in Modi's home state of Gujarat, Modi said last week that he was angry with anti-social elements who commit crimes by night and guard by day
 Let's gimmick togadiya ne modi se apane is bayaan ko sabit karne ko kaha ki 80 fisadi gaurakshak asamaajik gatividhiyon main lage rahete hai

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a big statement on Friday about the accused in the Malegaon blast case and BJP candidate from Bhopal, Sadhvi Pragya
 mahatma gandhi ke hatyare nathuram godse ko deshbhakt vaale bayaan par piem modi ne kaha ki main sadhvi pragna ko kabhi maaf nahin par paaungaa
 The way PM Modi has reacted to this, it is clear that the future politics of Sadhvi Pragya is not going to be easy
 ek tivi channel ko die intervyuu main piem modi ne kaha ki bhale hi sadhvi pragna ne maafee maang lee ho lekin main apane man se unhen kabhi maaf nahin kar paaungaa
 PM Modi is not happy with Sadhvi Pragya's comment
 sadhvi pragna lagaataar vivaadit bayaan dekar surkhiyon main bani rahati hai or ab party netritv bhi unke bayanon se khush najar nahin aa rahaa he
 In fact, on Thursday, reacting to the statement of actor Kamal Haasan, Sadhvi Pragya said that Nathuram Godse was a patriot, is a patriot and will remain a patriot
 unako aatankwaadi kehane vaale logon ko apane girebaan main jhankkar dekhnaa chahie

 Will have to stay with conflicting statements
 Pragyadvi Pragya is seen falling alone in the party with her statements
 vipaksh to unpar hamalavar he hi, party kaa bhi unako saath nahin mil rahaa he
 Till now, his statements were clarified by the party spokespersons or ministers, but now when there is a strong reaction directly from PM Modi, then Sadhvi Pragya will have to be careful about her statements further and stay away from the disputed statements

 Then i realized that there is something like this in this song
 is gane ke alphos, compojishan or baaki chijen kuch to aisi hai
 "pankaj Udas told that because of this song, i have also felt things in my life that i never thought i would be able to feel
 uttar pradesh or madhyapradesh ke sipaahi mujhe patr likh rahe hai
 Before reading those letters, there is a sense of the life of the soldiers
 acchhee baat yah he ki unke bheetar apni zindagi kii haalat ko lekar chetana jaagrit ho rahi he
 It is true that our police system is inhuman and through its misdeeds creates horrific pain in the lives of people
 lekin yah bhi sahi he ki isi police vyavastha main police ke log bhi amanviya jivan jhel rahe hai
 Their immorality is not just afflicting the common people but they themselves are victims of their immorality
 jhooth, bhrashtachar or laalach ne unki zindagi main koi sukh-shanti nahin di he
 If they look honestly at decades of experience, then they will understand that they got nothing from it
 samaaj ko bhi nahin mila
 His own family could not be found
 meri raay main agar unki yah chetana is aniatikta se mukti kii taraf le jaati he tabhi ve apane liye sukhi jivan rach paaenge
 Otherwise their sufferings will not end
 uttar pradesh ke ek sipaahi kii yah baat bilkul sahi he
 When he points to the discrepancies arising from the Police Act of 1861, he writes that "even today, no one survives the repressive policy in the police department, from the police officer to the police officer
 yah afsos janak he ki swatantraaa ke 72 saal baad bhi pulicekarmiyon kii behatari ke liye kisi bhi raajnneetik party kii sarkaar ne sarthak prayaas nahin kiya
 The situation in the police department today is that every employee is dissatisfied
 “ ek sipaahi dwaara likhaa yah patr dilasa de rahaa he ki log apane str par abhivyakti kii kshamta kaa vistaar kar rahe hai
 Trying to understand the reasons for their exploitation
 mujhe garv he ki uttar pradesh ke is sipaahi ke patr se kaaphi kuch seekhney ko mila he
 i wish i could take the name
 parantu nalayak afasaron kii naaraazgi use na jhelni pade isliye naam nahin de rahaa hum
 “A small example is a soldier being given a bicycle allowance even in this era
 is baat ko uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri se lekar grih sachiv tak jaanate hai ki is yug main ek sipaahi ke liye cycle se duty sambhav hi nahin he
 Then why the soldier got a bicycle allowance? Similarly, the amount of vehicle allowance given to a sub-inspector is not possible in the same vehicle allowance, he can visit his area in a week
 thane kii jeep kaa deazal bhi thanadhyaksh ko apni jeb se dalwaanaa padataa he
 "I also agree with this part of the letter of the soldier
 mere kai mitra jo sab inspector hai yaa thanadhyaksh hai bataate hai ki is tarah ke intazaam ke liye na chaahate hue bhi aniatik kaary karne ke liye majaboor hai
 Of course the system itself would force
 varna wo maukey par jeep lekar na pahunche to janata gaali degi or suspend bhi hona pad saktaa he
 The police department forces that its police never remain honest
 main samaj saktaa hum ki isamen eemaandaar police karmi ko kitni mushkil hoti hogi
 Or because of the system, which is forced to fill diesel by either juggling or recovering, they will also be embarrassed on their way home
 na chaahate hue bhi unki aatma par boj banataa he
 People who are habitually corrupt and have a lot of fear, they are psychopathic, nothing can be done, but the system should be such that it promotes honesty
 aaj pulicekarmi kii janchhavi kharaab ho chuki he, jisaki keemat sipaahi bhi chukaa rahe hai
 By taking advantage of this, governments are exploiting them further
 unhen pataa he ki sipaahi andolan karegaa to janata ulte unhen cosegi
 Bad and dirty barracks are also mentioned in the UP soldier's letter
 ek baar ek eemaandaar ipies kaa tabadalaa noida hua
 His wife messaged me that is much more expensive than other cities
 yahaan daal bahut mahangi he
 Do not know how the soldiers of Noida will live
 unke liye is shahar main sammanit zindagi asambhav he
 Families cannot keep it
 “sipaahi ke baiyrakon kaa bura haal he
 The families of most policemen do not live with them
 kyonki unako adhiktar makaan maalik kiraaye par makaan nahin dete hai
 After the exhausting duty, all the policemen do not even get the kind of food
 “is patr ne mujhe aashwast kiya he ki police karmiyon ke bheetar chetana jaagrit ho rahi he
 Hopefully, they will take it to a higher level
 samaaj main pidaa kaa samandar nazar aata he
 Freedom from this suffering is possible only when we all accept our old dishonesty, abandon them and follow the path of Satyagraha
 bagair satya kaa saath die aap apane liye nyaaysangat vyavastha or jivan kii maang nahin kar sakate, hasil to dur kii baat he
 When the police personnel of UP read this article, think on it
 ve dhire-dhire thela or dukaanon se vasuuli choden
 Boycott your boss' immoral orders in the manner of Satyagraha, refuse
 kahen ki ve eemaandaar or saadhaaran jivan jeena chaahate hai
 Life of recovery is worse
 yah kaam jaldi nahin hoga, kai saal lagenge
 Until this happens, they will not get the enjoyment and respect they deserve in life
 madhyapradesh se bhi bahut patr aa rahe hai
 There the Kamal Nath government is not fulfilling the promises made to the soldiers
 jabaki congress ne ghoshnaa patr main likhakar diya tha ki satta main aate hi sipaahiyon ke scale ko badhayegi
 The Congress had promised that the soldier would increase the scale of the brothers from 1900 to 2400, which has not been done so far
 is vakt sipaahi bandhuon ko awaas bhatta 400-500 miltaa he
 Even so many garages are not available
 cycle bhatta 18 rupee prati maah diya jaataa he, jo vaaki haasyaaspad he
 At least 5000 rupees should be received
 yahi nahin vaada kiya tha ki unhen niyamit avkaash milegaa, jo ki nahin diya ja rahaa he
 The soldiers are also a family of brothers
 ve maheenon tak chuttee par nahin ja pate hai
 Why shouldn't they be discharged? congress sarkaar ko samaj lenaa chahie ki vah apane vaade se mukaregi to phir janata unki taraf nahin dekhegi
 Chief Minister Kamal Nath should leave all work and fulfill the promise made to the sepoy brothers or else they should resign and apologize for making false promises
 sipaahi bandhuon se apil he ki sabase pehle ve apane baiyrakon kii kharaab haalat kii tasviir khinchakar mujhe bhejein
 If the government does not allow posting on Facebook, then take a print and stick it on the walls and write slogan that your soldier stays in such condition
 wo khud narak bhoge or aap usase swarg kii ummid karen, kya yah nyaaysangat he? bazaar-bazaar main yah poster chupchaap chipka aaen
 Inspector brothers should do the same
 shaadi byaah main jahaan jaaen vahaan logon kii apni haalat bataate rahen
 Explain what kind of toilet facilities you have got
 pani kii suvidha kisi he
 How is the food facility? parivaar kin halaat main rahata he
 They also have to tell the truth about how helpful the money of bribe or recovery is in this bad condition
 kya usase unke jivan main shanti aati he
 Time to tell the truth is not fixed
 aap ant samay main bhi sach bol sakate hai or jivan ke bich main bhi
 It is very important to tell your truth
 aapke saath puraa insaaf hona chahie or aapke satya se hi logon ko insaaf milegaa
 All of us should help the sepoy brothers out of their lives of suffering and lies
 unhen gale lagane kii zaroorat he
 We all should pressurize the governments to give them four days off every month
 selleri acchhee mili
 Better living facilities
 sipaahi hamaare hi pariwaron kaa hissaa hote hai
 Policemen across India are leading painful lives
 wo yah bhul jaaen ki akhbaaron or channelon main khabaren chalavakar unki pidaa kaa ant hoga
 The soldiers of all the states will have to be awakened
 eemaandaar hona hoga
 Instead of immorality, self-power and moral strength will have to be developed
 sabko ek saath haath milakar, ek sur main awaz uthaani hogi
 When the voices were raised, echoed in Patna, echoed in Bhopal and from Lucknow to Delhi and Haryana

 com / wz2n0qve9b rajasthan ke chunavi ganit kaa gyaan rakhane vaale lagbhag har visheshgy ne pradesh main is baar camel khilne kii baat pehle hi kah di thi
 But this lotus will bloom so big, it was not even conceived by the BJP itself
 chunaav nattejey saamne hai
 BJP has got 162 seats out of 199 in the state
 yani bijepi ne 81 fisad siten hasil kii hai
 This figure is historical for the BJP itself, including Rajasthan
 rajasthan main modi kii lahar kii kalpana to har kisi ne kii thi, lekin yah tufaan kaa rup le legi yah koi nahin jaanata tha
 Congress has got only 21 seats in the state, which is around 10 percent
 ek tarah se kahen to congress ke liye yah dhobi pachhad jaisi sthiti he
 However, except for Chhattisgarh in four states, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh too have similar Congress positions
 lekin rajasthan par baat isliye ki yahaan party kii jeet ke liye congress alaakaman sonia gandhi se lekar upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi tak ne khub pasinaa bahaya tha
 Say politics, not public strategy, if you focus on the electoral mathematics of Rajasthan, then there is no need for a high school
 janata beete kai varshon se yahaan har paanch saal par parivartan ko chunati he
 Even after this result, the public made this strategy clear that they want to give opportunity to the new government every 5 years
 1998 main bhaajapa ko hataakar pradesh kii janata ne congress ke haathon main janadesh saunpa tha
 Since then, this is the third election in which the people of the state have given a chance to the BJP and Congress governments one after the other
 aankadon me gujarat ko bhi choda pichemaujuuda nateezon ne bijepi kii sabase badi jeet ke aankade ko badal kar rakh diya he
 Earlier, the 2002 Gujarat victory was the biggest for the party
 tab bijepi 182 siton par chunaav ladi thi, jisamen se 127 siton par party ko jeet hasil hui thi
 That is 69 percent
 vahiin rajasthan kii baat karen to yahaan 2003 main bijepi ne 197 siton par pratyaashee khadey kiye the, jisamen se party ko 120 siton par jeet mili thi
 This was a figure of 60 percent
 haalanki isse purv congress ne bhi bijepi ko 1998 main kul daavedaari main se 76 fisad siten jitkar karaari shikast di thi
 But the latest figure of 81 percent is like a comeback for the Congress, including Sood
 badha vasundhara kaa kadchunaav nateezon ke saath hi ek baar phir vasundhara raaje ke netritv main sarkaar kaa bananaa tay he
 The Modi effect may have worked in this victory, but it has also increased Vasundhara's stature in the party and the state
 vipaksh ne bhi vasundhara ke liye 'taanashaah' or 'ait piem no siem' jaise jumale taiyaar kiye the, lekin inamen se ek bhi kaam nahin aae
 With the announcement of elections, the way Vasundhara has made a strong presence everywhere from the selection of candidates to the strategy, it has further strengthened them within and outside the party after the results
 dher hue congressi diggajais baar chunaav main congress ke kai diggaj dharaashai ho gaye
 Not only this, the public also rejected the relatives of tainted leaders
 osiyaan se congress ummidavaar or purv mantri mahipal maderna kii patni lila maderna, luni se malakhan vishnoi kii maa amari devi, dudu se purv mantri babulal nagar ke bhai hajarilal nagar ko haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 Apart from this, Congress Diggers Durru Mian from Tijara, Pratap Singh Khachariwas from Civil Lines Jaipur, Shanti Dhariwal from Kota North, Bina Kak from Sumerpur, BD Kalla from Bikaner West, Deepender Singh from Srimadhopur, Ramlal Jat from Assin and Devi Singh Bhati from Kolayat Could not save Congress' credibility
 kaam nahin ai rahul kii bhavuktapradesh main jeet ke liye congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne desh ke liye apni daadi indira or pita rajeev gandhi kii shahadat tak yaad dilaai thi
 At the Chunavi rally in Churu, Rahul even said emotionally that he feared that Aman's enemies would one day kill him (rahul)
 lekin afsos ki chunavi dangal main janata ko unki bhavukta bhi nahin baandh saki
 The Gujarat High Court on Friday granted bail to Amit Shah, a former state home minister and accused in the Sohrabuddin fake encounter case
 gauratlab he ki kareeb teen maheene pehle shah ko sibiai ne giraftaar kiya tha
 Justice RH Shukla granted bail to Shah on a personal bond of one lakh rupees and on the condition that he would file his attendance at the cbi's Mumbai office every month as the case was registered there
 nyaayalay ne jamaanat aadesh par teen saptaah kaa sthagan lagane sambandhi sibiai kii maang ko bhi khaarij kar diya
 CBI counsel Yogesh Ravani argued that she wanted to appeal against the order
 shah ke vakil nirupam nanavati ne adaalat ko yakeen dilaayaa ki unke muvakkil jamaanat kii sabhi sharton ko puraa karenge
 Nanavati also said that if CBI sets some other condition, Shah will fulfill it too
 gauratlab he ki shah ko sibiai ne 25 july ko giraftaar kiya tha
 He has spent more than three months in Sabarmati jail
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ke kareebi maane jane vaale shah ko sibiai ne november 2005 main anjaam die gaye soharabuddin shaikh farji muthbhed kii sajeesh kaa pramukh ‘sutaradhar’ qaraar diya he
 Shah is also accused of conspiring to murder Sohrabuddin's wife Kausar Bi and his associate Tulsiram Prajapati
 isse pehle, sibiai kii ek adaalat ne shah kii jamaanat yachika khaarij kar di thi
 On October 8, rejecting Shah's bail plea, the court had said that there was complete apprehension that if he is released on bail, he could use his political clout to influence the investigation
 nanavati ne kaha ki bachi hui prakriya puri kar liye jane ke baad shah ko sabarmati jail se reeha kar diya jayega
 The legal battle between the CBI and Shah, which lasted more than three months, saw clashes between senior advocate Ram Jethmalani and KTS Tulsi
 gauratlab he ki jethmalani shah ke jabaki tulsi sibiai ke vakil hai
 Jethmalani said during his cross-examination that the CBI court's decision not to grant bail to Shah lacked judicial balance

 On Friday, January 26, 2018, Kasganj, a small town in UP, allegedly rioted over the tricolor, which lost a life, lost crores of rupees and the social trust that has been broken cannot be valued at all
 is sawaal kaa jawaab to shaayad hi mili ki ye danga ek sajeesh thi kyonki abhi tak mujffarnagar dange kii sajeesh kaa sach saamne nahin aa sakaa he
 It is evident that politics prevails over subsequent investigations and the order for the release of the accused begins
 upi main akhilesh yadav kii sapa sarkaar aatankwadayon tak se cese hataane kii pahal kar chuki thi
 Now the present BJP government has started the process of removing the cases from the accused in the Muzaffarnagar riots
 police kaa naakaaraapan donon hi maamalon main baraabar kii bhoomika main dikhaai detaa he
 In Muzaffarnagar riots also, the accused were not arrested by the police and later weapons like AK-47 were also recovered there
 kasganj dange main bhi hatya ke mukhya aaropee ke ghar se bandook, videshi pistal baraamad hui or vah bhi chaar dinon main giraftaar nahin kiya ja sakaa he
 The lack of police administration is made clear by the events
 ganatantr diwas kii bike raily nikaalane ke liye kursiyaan hataane kii jid, haath main tirange ke saath bhagava jhande or munh se nikalate hinsa ke shabd
 Here the violence of words first took place and then the fire was hatred
 apshabd bole gaye
 People active on social media have put quintals of ghee in the fire of Kasganj
 zyaadaatar twit or post dange ko pakistanprast or rashtravaadiyon ke bich kii jang bataa rahe hai or kuch tivi channel bhi isi raah par chal rahe hai
 On 26 January, there is generally more security and on Friday, especially the good deployment of police is done around Muslim religious places of UP
 elaiu sakriy hoti he, hotalon or laajon kii talaashi hoti he lekin kasganj main kuch nahin hua
 The proof is that pistols and bombs are recovered from Laz on 28 January
 itnaa hi nahin 26 janvari ko subah 10 baje takaraav hota he or police haath par haath dhare baithi rahi
 Then at 11 o'clock there is tension and at 12 o'clock a man named Chandan is killed
 petrol bam bhi chalate hai
 After all, how did the administration prepare for Republic Day that arson and violence took place
 chandan gupta kii hatya tak kaa ghatnakram taish main hua bhale hi lage lekin iske baad hui lutpaat or aagjanee or raajnneeti sajeesh kaa hissaa jarur lagati he
 When the boundaries of the district are sealed, how did Pooja Shakun Pandey, National Secretary of the All India Hindu Mahasabha reach Chandan's house and start giving speeches on TV
 sabase khatarnaak baat ye he ki bhaajapa or usase jude sanghathanon ke netaa lagaataar dange ko tirange kii asmita se jodakar musalamaanon ko iskaa virdohi qaraar de rahe hai
 While all the reports of the incident are clearly saying that the Muslim community had organized its Republic Day program on Veer Abdul Hameed Tirahe
 ye pichley saal bhi hua tha or abivipi kii bike raily bhi pichley saal nikali thi lekin is baar sadak par kursiyaan padi thim
 There was a shot in the debate about their removal
 jaahir he ye saaf taur par aapraadhik ghatana thi lekin baad main is par tanaav badha, danga failaa or ab raajnneeti ho rahi he
 BJP leaders present from social media to visual media are bombarding questions related to the elegance of the tricolor
 ye ek samudaay ko bevajaah kathghare main khadey karne jaisaa he, kyonki apradhi se kisi samudaay kii pahchaan nahin hoti
 If this happens, people of any religion in the country are not able to lift their heads and walk because in almost all religions who commit heinous acts
 kasganj kaa maahaul lagbhag saamaanya hota ja rahaa he lekin iskaa raajnneetik istemaal lagaataar badhata dikh rahaa he
 It will increase further and may continue to be used politically till 2019, this is the conspiracy

 ) *** kya is khabar kaa koi matlab he ki dadri ke bisahda gaanv main rahane vaale akhlaaq ke ghar ke frij main matan nahin, gomance rakhaa hua tha? kya vaaki mudda yah he ki akhlaaq ke ghar matan tha yaa gomance? agar vah gomance tha- jaisaa ki mathura kii prayogshaala kii forecinc report bataati he- tab bhi kya bheed ko yah haq tha ki vah akhlaaq ke ghar hamalaa kare or use peet-peet kar maar daale? Please remember that Akhlaq's death is related to a mob frenzy
 kisi bheed ko yah haq nahin diya ja saktaa ki vah kisi ko uske ghar se khinch kar nikaale or maar daale
 More tragic in the case of Akhlaq is that the mob punished him for something which was not even by law
 gaanv ke laud spikar se anjaan logon kii shah par prachaar hua, ek bheed ikattha hui or usne hatya kar daali
 This mobocracy is very dangerous for our democracy
 lekin, akhlaaq ke puure maamle ko gomance rakhane yaa na rakhane kaa mudda bana diya gaya
 No one has noticed that there are increasing people in this country who have a cruel cruelty of justice based on their beliefs
 sangh parivaar or uski aasthaaon se jude sanghathan kahin goraksha ke naam par logon ko peet rahe hai or kahin desh kii raksha ke naam par lathi-goli chalaane kaa prashikshan hasil kar rahe hai
 But neither cow can survive nor country can survive with their activism
 yah baat ab kai baar kahi ja chuki he ki agar gaay ko uski badahaali se bachaana he to iske liye hamen sansthagat praytn karne honge- acchhee goshaalaayein banavaani hongi, budhi hoti gaayon kii dekhbhaal ke raste nikaalane honge or yah kaam mehnat bhi maangata he, sooyeeboojh bhi or saadhan bhi
 This work will not be done by beating the drivers and cleaners of trucks carrying cows, nor with the life of Akhalaq
 isse bas gaay ke naam par hone vaali raajnneeti sadhegi, vah dhruvikaran sadhegaa jisase vot bantate hai
 Similarly, there is an army of 13 lakhs to protect the country and there are 21 lakh equivalent paramilitary forces to deal with internal disturbances
 yah sena desh kii raksha ke liye lathi-danda chalaanaa or sarkas kii tarah aag ke gole se nikalnaa seekhney vaale sanghiyon kii mohataaj nahin he
 He is equipped with state-of-the-art weapons and if he also has few weapons, he will come from the famous Ordnance Factories of the world, not from the Union Ordnance
 phir ye sarkas chhap deshbhakti sikh rahe log apane joshourosh kaa kya istemaal karenge? ve desh ko un logon se bachaayenge jo unki nigaah main aatankwaadi hai
 They will turn mutual disputes into riots and try their might there
 yah kaam ve pichley tamaam varshon main odisha se lekar gujarat or uttar pradesh tak karte rahe hai
 These people will not be arrested, there will be no legal action
 agar kisi sanvaidhanik loklaj ke nirvaah ke liye inhen pakadaa bhi gaya to ye chhot jaaenge- adaalaton main inke kilaaf pukhta saboot nahin niklenge
 It is actually a process of democracy overcoming mobocracy which will prove to be very dangerous
 yah bheedtantr pehle apane aalochakon ko dhamkaayegaa, phir unhen maar daalega
 He will not accept the intellectual environment that questions his activities, exposes his illiteracy
 kulbergi, pansaare or dabholkar baar-baar maare jaaenge
 The comments or akhlaaq kii bhi baar-baar hatya hogi
 It is now being proved that there was no beef in his house, mutton
 isi aadhaar par bijepi saansad yogi adityanath tak maang kar chuke hai ki akhlaaq ke naam par diya gaya muawza waapas liya jaae
 Did he get compensation for whether he kept mutton, not beef, or that a mob had kicked him out of the house? lekin baat yaheen khatm nahin hogi
 The accused of killing Akhlaq will be exempted from each tax
 ek din yah sabit hoga ki in logon ko galat fansaaya gaya tha
 The killers will be throated in the throat, they will contest and win
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi akhlaaq ko baar-baar maaraa jayega or aage bhi aisa hi hoga

 The killers will be throated in the throat, they will contest and win
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi akhlaaq ko baar-baar maaraa jayega or aage bhi aisa hi hoga
 But, the whole issue of Akhlaq made the issue of whether or not to keep beef
 kisi ne is baat par dhyaan nahin diya ki is desh main lagaataar aise log bad rahe hai jinamein apni dharanaon ke aadhaar par insaaf karne kii badi krur hadandi he
 Organizations associated with the Sangh Parivar and its faiths are beating people in the name of cow protection and getting sticks training in the name of protecting the country
 lekin unki sakriyata se na gaay batch sakati he na desh batch saktaa he
 It has been said many times now that if the cow is to be saved from its plight, then for this we will have to make institutional efforts - build good cowsheds, find ways to take care of old cows and this work also demands hard work, understanding As well as means
 yah kaam gaay laate-le jate trakon ke driveron or clinron ko peet kar nahin hoga, na akhlaaq kii jaan lekar hoga
 This will only curb politics in the name of cow, it will curb polarization by which votes are distributed
 isi tarah desh kii raksha ke liye 13 lakh kii sena he or andruni gadabadiyon se bhi nibatane ke liye 21 lakh ke baraabar ardhsainik bal hai
 This army is not averse to the Sanghis who have learned to run sticks and run like a circus to protect the country
 vah atyaadhunik hathiyaaron se las he or agar uske paas kuch kam hathiyaar bhi hai to ve sangh kii aayudhashala se nahin, duniya ke mashhoor aayudh kaarkaanon se aaenge
 Then what will this circus impression people learning about patriotism use their zeal for? They will save the country from those who are terrorists in their eyes
 ve aapasi vivaadon ko dangon main badalenge or vahaan apana parakram aajamaayenge
 They have been doing this work in all the years from Odisha to Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh
 in logon ko giraftaar nahin kiya jayega, koi kanoonee karrwai nahin hogi
 If they are caught for the maintenance of any constitutional public, they will be left free - there will be no strong evidence against them in the courts
 yah darasal loktantr par bheedtantr par kabiz hone kii prakriya he jo bahut khataranaak sabit hogi
 This mob would first threaten its critics, then kill them
 use vah bauddhik maahaul kisi bhi haal main manzur nahin hoga jo uski gatividhiyon ko prashnaankit kare, uski anpadhata ko ujagar kare
 Kulbargi, Pansare and Dabholkar will be killed again and again
 tippaniyan And Akhlaq will be killed again and again
 abhi yah sabit kiya ja rahaa he ki uske ghar main matan nahin gomance tha
 On this basis, even BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has demanded that the compensation given in the name of Akhlaq be withdrawn
 kya use muawza is baat kaa mila tha ki usne gomance nahin, matan rakhaa tha, yaa is baat kaa ki ek bheed ne ghar se nikaal kar use maaraa tha? But this will not end here
 akhlaaq kii hatya ke aaropee ek-ek kar chhutate chale jaaenge
 One day it will be proved that these people were falsely implicated

 akhlaaq kii hatya ke aaropee ek-ek kar chhutate chale jaaenge
 One day it will be proved that these people were falsely implicated
 hatyaron ke gale main jayamala hogi, ve chunaav ladenge or jeetenge

 The accused of killing Akhlaq will be exempted from each tax
 ek din yah sabit hoga ki in logon ko galat fansaaya gaya tha
 The killers will be throated in the throat, they will contest and win
 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan bhi akhlaaq ko baar-baar maaraa jayega or aage bhi aisa hi hoga
 But this will not end here
 akhlaaq kii hatya ke aaropee ek-ek kar chhutate chale jaaenge
 One day it will be proved that these people were falsely implicated
 hatyaron ke gale main jayamala hogi, ve chunaav ladenge or jeetenge

 is baar maamla chaaval ke niryaat se jude ghotaale kaa he
 Questions have arisen on the policy of first come first serve
 2 ji ghotaale main isi niti ko lekar fajihat main fansi kendra sarkaar ek baar phir ghirti nazar aa rahi he
 The matter is currently in the Delhi High Court
 padhein: kaise seedbluji ghotaale main shila dikshit tak pahunchi aanchamhangaai kaabo main rahe iske liye sarkaar ne chaar saal se gairbasmati chaaval ke niryaat par roak laga rakhi thi
 But due to bumper yields of rice in the last two years, the government decided to open exports
 kisaanon ko ummid thi ki jaise hi chaaval kaa niryaat khulegaa unako chaaval kaa acha rate mil paayegaa
 But in order to benefit some special people, it was heavily manipulated
 philhal dilli hoicourt ne chaaval ke niryaat par roak laga di he
 The rationale behind opening the export of non-basmati rice was that farmers would get a higher price, but after some companies had the right to export, the farmers had less hope of getting a higher price
 padhein: ab saamne aayaa yuavi kii kharid main ghotaladift ne pehle aao pehle paao kii niti ke aadhaar par das lakh ton gairbasmati chaaval ke niryaat kaa license 82 companiyon ko diya he
 16 of these companies belong to the same family
 dift ke adhikariyon ne niryaat license ek hi parivaar ko dene ke liye niyamo ko khul kar todaa or computer program main hera-pheri bhi kii
 DGFT had decided that no company would get license to export more than 12500 tonnes
 lekin 16 aisi companiyon ko license diya gaya jo ek hi parivaar kii hai or mahaj license hathiyaane ke liye alag-alag naam se companiyaan banaain gayi thi
 The names of these companies are as follows - 1
 lmaje oversij2
 LMJ Logistics 3
 lmaje construction4
 LMJ Services 5
 lmaje commercialsin companiyon ke maalik he jayant kumaar jain
 His company LMJ Logistics applied for a maximum of 12500 tonnes for export of non-precious rice, and DGFT gave him license to export 12500 tonnes
 isi tarah jain kii hi duusari company net agri company praivet limited ko bhi 12500 ton chaaval niryaat kaa license mil gaya
 Jayant Kumar Jain, director of LMJ Company, is also a director in Net Agri
 dekhen: cash for vot cond main dilli police ko noticesbase dilachasp to yah baat he ki jayant itane bhaagyashaalee hai ki first kam first sarv kii polishi ke antargat unke parivaar kii 16 companiyon ko niryaat kaa license mil gaya
 Similarly, LMJ Overseas also got a license of 12500 tonnes
 is company ke board main bhi diarector ke taur par jayant kumaar jain maujuud he
 But the story does not end here
 chaaval ghotaale par aaropon kii sachai jaanane ke liye ajtak ne jeke jain ke saamne chand sawaal rakhe
 We tell you the answer sent by JK Jain to the questions sent via email
 jayant ne kaha he, ‘mere upar lagaae ja rahe saare aarope bebuniyaad hai
 Since only the initial allocation has been made, the license is issued when the company completes the bank guarantee of 10% and other procedures
 ’kaamanwealth ghotaalaa: sieji report main shila sarkaar doshijahan tak pehle aao-pehle paao kii baat he to is policy par adhikaar praapt mantriyon ke samooh ne muhar lagaai or usee mutabik adhisuchana jari hui
 Secondly, it is not possible to tamper with the first-come-first-served policy because all this work is done through computer
 jis kisi ke paas iisi code ho, wo desh ke kisi bhi kone baithe-baithe online aavedan kar saktaa he
 Jayant says, 'I don't know about most of the companies that are being mentioned

 An unclaimed trolley bag was found near Metro Pillar No
 4 in the Arrival area of terminal 3 at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI Airport) on Thursday night at 12:56, which was spotted by CISF trooper VK Singh
 usne fouran isaki jaankaree apane afasaron ko di
 Shortly thereafter, the CISF examined the bag with a machine exploratory vapor detector and the machine gave positive signs of RDX being in the bag
 siaiesaf ke dog squad ne bhi visphotak hone ke sanket die
 After this, the CISF called the bomb disposal squad and cordoned off the entire area and stopped the movement of vehicles and passengers at that place
 raat kareeb dedh baje siaiesaf kaa bam nirodhak daste ne jab bag kaa eks re kiya to uski tasvirensandigdh dikhin
 After this, at around 3 pm the bag was taken to the cooling pit area of the airport
 talaashi ke baad kareeb 3:30 baje arival aria main yatriyon kii awajahi shuru hui
 All this information was leaked in the media and as soon as the news broke, panic spread at the airport
 siaisef ke diaiji ne bhi media se baat karte hue bataaya ki jaanch chal rahi he ki bag main visphotak he ki nahin lekin unhone kaha ki ardex hone ke positive sanket mili hai
 This news continued on TV channels throughout the day and security checks were tightened at the airport
 siaisef ne ye bhi bataaya ki sandigdh bag 24 ghante kooling pit aria main rahegaa uske baad hi use kholaa jayega, lekin shuukravaar shaam shahid khan naam kaa ek shaks pahunchaa or usne bataaya ki wo ballgarh kaa rahane vaala he or ye bag usee kaa he
 Which has chocolates, chargers, clothes and earrings
 shahid ne bataaya ki wo mumbai se teen doston ke saath aayaa tha or galati se bag bhul gaya
 According to police, when the bag was opened, the same thing came out of it and the bag was handed over to the person
 sawaal ye he ki siaisef ne jis shuruaati jaanch ke aadhaar par ye kaha ki bag main ardex hone ke sanket mili hai, uskaa kya hua
 Due to this, the two and a half hour Arrival area was kept closed, which caused long traffic jams and people were disturbed
 kya sandigdh saamaan ke jaanch karne kiyahi aadhunik takanic he
 Why was there such haste to leak news in the media? The biggest thing is that even after CCTV cameras were installed, the security agencies could not find out who kept the bags
 police ne ye khud mana ki shahid apane aap thane pahunchaa
 Should the speed of investigation be so slow on such a case? It took more than 15 hours to find out what is and what is not in a suspicious bag and that too when the bag owner himself came and opened the bag
 siaisef kaa kahana he unki ividi mashin main 1000 tarah ke visphotakon ko check karne ke program fiks hote hai
 Even if there is a particle of an explosive in some material or there is a chemical in some natural material, the machine still gives a positive signal
 aisa kai baar hota rahata he lekin jaanch ke baad agar koi visphotak nahin mila to clin chit de di jaati he
 But this time, due to leak of internal message of CISF, the problem increased
 ab ye bhi jaanch karai ja rahi he ki massej kisne li kiya
 On Friday evening, the CISF also said that the area in which the suspicious bag was found is not their area but the police

 India has played 56 matches in all formats since October 2018, out of which Kohli has played in 48
 haalanki chayan samiti is faisle ko kohli par hi chhodeygi ki vah brake chaahate hai yaa phir jari rakhana chaahate hai
 There is a possibility of discussion about 26-year-old all-rounder Shivam Dubey from Mumbai, who could be selected in place of all-rounder in place of injured Hardik Pandya
 teen november se dilli main shuru hone vaali teen maichon kii tii-20 siries (do anya match rajkot or nagpur main) ke alaava bangladesh kii team vishwa championships ke antargat do test khelegi

 a BCCI official, on the condition of anonymity, said, "if both Rishabh and Sanju are in the team, then there will be no problem
 ye donon ipel main bhi ek saath khel chuke hai
 Rishabh has had limited success in the short format, but looking at the future we need to feed him
 ’unhone kaha, ‘saath hi sanju main match kaa rukh badalane kii kaabiliyat he
 Keeping the T20 World Cup in mind, the team management also needs to look at other options, as everyone knows that now is the time to look ahead of Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 ’ kohli team main nahin honge to samson ko ‘back-ap’ ballebaaj ke rup dekha ja rahaa he, lekin yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki manish pandey team main apana sthaan barkaraar rakh pate hai yaa nahin
 All-rounder Shivam Dubey is also being looked at by selectors Shivam Dubey of Mumbai has beaten Vijay Shankar in the second option of the all-rounder in the shorter format
 sutara ne kaha, ‘har koi sahamat he ki sivam kii gendbaaji abhi tak antarrashtriya str kii nahin he or vah hardik kii variety ke kareeb bhi nahin he
 But he is a left-handed player who is a positive thing and can hit big sixes
 ’kalai ke spinneron kii jodi kuldeep yadav or yujavendra chahal ko chune jane kii ummid nahin he, kyonki rahul chaahar or washington sundar ko ek or mauka milanaa tay he
 Lokesh Rahul is likely to retain his place in the team after a good performance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy
 anbhavi salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan kharaab form main hai, lekin chayankarta shaayad unhen ek or siries main jari rakh sakate hai
 Mayank Agarwal could be a substitute for reserve opener if he is ruled out
 deepak chaahar, navdeep saini or khalil ahamed ke teen mukhya tej gendbaaj hone kii ummid he

 ) In the battle of the Samajwadi Party divided between fathers and sons, the chances of reconciliation are very less
 sutron kii maane to mulaayam singh yadav or akhilesh yadav kii baithak se koi rasta nahin nikal sakaa he
 Ramgopal Yadav has said that no compromise is going to happen in the SP
 unhone kaha, 'akhilesh yadav hi hamaare rashtriya adhyaksh hai
 We will contest elections under his leadership
 chunaav chinh kaa faisla chunaav ayog karegaa
 'there is a struggle between the two groups over the party symbol
 cycle kaa nishaan kiskaa hoga iske liye mulaayam singh or akhilesh yadav kaa khemaa chunaav ayog se mila or cycle chunaav chinh par daawa thoka
 The mulayam-akhilesh meeting, however, seems to be in vain for reconciliation efforts between the two factions
 mulaayam singh yadav apane kheme se baatcheet kar rahe hai
 Earlier, Azam Khan arrived in Delhi with the reconciliation formula but left for Lucknow without meeting Mulayam Azam
 haalanki, lakhadu main akhilesh mulaayam singh se milane unke ghar pahunche
 The meeting is going on between the two leaders regarding the reconciliation formula
 shivpal yadav bhi vahaan pahunch gaye hai
 According to sources, Akhilesh may step down as president for Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh can get the right to share tickets
 sulah kaa nayaa formulaspa main sulah ke jis formule par baat ho rahi he uske mutabik akhilesh mulaayam singh ke liye rashtriya adhyaksh kaa pad chhod sakate hai
 At the same time, Akhilesh will be given the responsibility of ticket distribution

 The party MLA said that all the workers are with Mulayam Singh and Akhilesh
 jald hi sabhi gatirodh dur kar liye jaaenge
 Most of the mlas are with us: After meeting the Ram Gopal Election Commission, Ram Gopal Yadav said that we have made our stand
 ramgopal yadav ne kaha ki hamaare saath party ke 90 fisadi vidhayak or 80 se 90 fisadi dailygats hai
 Therefore the real Samajwadi Party is the one whose president is Akhilesh Yadav
 isliye akhilesh yadav kii adhyakshata vaali party ko hi samaajawaadee party mana jaye
 We have told our point to the Commission: Naresh Agarwal: On being presented his position in the Election Commission, Akhilesh faction leader Naresh Aggarwal said that we have made our point
 har mudde par apana paksh rakhaa he
 Azam said - Expectations have not yet failed in getting reconciliation, Azam Khan said that there is despair and freedom but time is there
 abhi bhi kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Azam Khan says that he got success in this matter once and if the circumstances support him then he will definitely try for it
 abhi ye kahana jaldbaaji hogi ki ab sulah kaa koi rasta nahin bachaa he
 There is concern among minorities
 akhilesh or ramgopal ke nilamban par unhone kaha ki kisne sochaa tha 24 ghante main nilamban waapas hoga
 With activist Akhilesh: Naresh Agarwal Meanwhile, Naresh Aggarwal of Akhilesh group has said that there will be no reconciliation effort from our side
 adhiveshan main jo bhi prastaav paas hue wo ham chunaav ayog ke saamne rakhenge
 All the workers are with Akhilesh
 akhilesh hamaare rashtriya adhyaksh hai
 He will go to the Election Commission and present his side
 samaajawaadee party or cycle hamaari he or hamen milani chahie
 This is the rationale of Akhilesh group, meanwhile, Akhilesh group also met the Election Commission on Tuesday regarding the battle of Symbol
 ramgopal yadav, naresh agarwal or kiranmay nanda chunaav ayog se mili
 Ram Gopalayadava asserted the cycle sign in front of the Election Commission
 ramgopal ne kaha ki mulaayam hamaare sangrakshak hai, hamaare adarsh hai
 Akhilesh is our national president
 samaajawaadee party hamaari he, cycle kaa chihn hamaara he
 No other party will take the mark because 90 percent people are with Akhilesh and we have faith in Netaji

 After this statement, a new controversy has started about the sign
 gauratlab he ki 1 janvari ko akhilesh gut ne lakhanu main adhiveshan kar akhilesh yadav ko sapa adhyaksh banane kaa elaan kiya tha
 After this, Mulayam Singh Yadav had issued an order to remove the two leaders Kiranmay Nanda and Naresh Aggarwal from the party, saying that the session was unconstitutional and said that the SP President is still Mulayam Singh
 ab kiranmay nanda ke is bayaan se maamle ne nayaa mode le liya he
 Mulayam Singh Yadav, a source close to Mulayam's side in the Election Commission, has said that Mulayam's side is strong in the Election Commission, as calling sessions by members outside the party is unconstitutional
 sirf party adhyaksh hi adhiveshan bula saktaa he
 The decision to withdraw Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav to the SP was not taken on any paper
 unka nishkasana waapas liya ja saktaa tha, lekin unhone adhiveshan bula liya
 Before the Mulayam met the Election Commission, there was a meeting of the leaders of the anti-akhilesh group, which included Khudmulayam Singh, Shivpal Yadav, Amar Singh, Jayaprada and Ambika Chaudhary, for about two hours at Mulayam Singh's Delhi residence on Monday afternoon
 baithak ke baad mulaayam, shivpal, amar singh or jaya pradaa chunaav ayog main apni shikaayat lekar pahunche
 Mulayam Singh Yadav informed the Election Commission about the latest political developments in the party
 sutron ke mutabik mulaayam ne ayog ko bataaya ki duusare kheme kii raajnneetik kaarywahi party samvidhan ke khilaaf he or jo ramgopal ne adhiveshan bulaayaa wo asanvaidhanik he, kyonkiramgopal or akhileshyadav ko pehle hi party se nikaala ja chukaa he
 In front of the commission, Mulayam also asserted his right to the 'cycle' election symbol
 'akhilesh khud main bade brands'party simbel ko lekar jari vivaad main akhilesh ke samarthak emelsi udaiveer singh ne kaha ki ham akhilesh ke naam par chunaav ladenge
 Udayveer said that Akhilesh is a brand in itself
 udaiveer ne haalanki ummid jataai ki netaji samajhane par maan jaaenge
 Let me also raise slogans of Netaji
 Meanwhile, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav met with his close mlas and leaders on Monday
 baithak main unase kaha ki ve chunaav kii taiyaari karen
 Akhilesh said that we and Netaji are one and the same
 aap hamaare naare lagaate hai to unke bhi lagaaein
 You people should also meet them
 akhilesh mangalvaar ko ek baar phir kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat karenge
 Before i left for Delhi completely, Mulayam said that i am fully fit

 If accused, the Supreme Court acquitted me

 a year ago, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was immersed in the celebration of taking over the throne of Delhi with a landslide victory after a full 10 years, on 3 June, the morning news of the party was abuzz
 tatkaaleen gramin vikaas mantri or maharashtra bijepi ke kaddavar netaa gopinath munde kaa india get ke paas ek car durghatana main nidhan ho gaya
 The country's Surface Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, who has lost more than 1
25 lakh lives every year in road accidents, announced on June 3, 2014 that a new law will be introduced within a month which will fix the bad mood of the country's roads
 sarkaar ne paanch saal main sadak durghatnaon main hone vaali mauton ko maujuuda str se aadhe par laane kaa lakshya bhi tay kar liya
 Apart from this, he expressed his intention to take action and fine against those who break the rules and regulations on the roads
 tay yah hua ki nayaa kanoon na sirf motor vehical act 1988 kii jagah legaa balki isamen neshnal road sefti and trephic management bill-2010 kii mul bhaavana ko bhi jod liya jayega
 That is, for the first time such a law will come in the country which will decide the traffic rules according to the operation of the vehicles as well as the quality of the road, safety of the road drivers and new requirements
 is kanoon par america, japan, china or sabase zyada australia main prachlit isi tarah ke kanoon kii chhap hogi
 But today, after a year, Alam is that Gadkari's ministry is busy making drafts of the law
 ab tak vidheyak ke chaar draft jari ho chuke hai or paanchvaan draft jald hi saamne aane vaala he
 The most annoying aspect is that whenever the government comes out with a new draft, the law seems flabbergasted from the previous draft
 shuruaati draft main jaan jokhim main daalane vaale niyambhang par 30,000 ru
 Till the fine was spoken and strict punishment was provided
 lekin chauthe draft tak aate-aate jurmaana or sajaa takreeban usee str par aa gai, jahaan ve maujuuda kanoon main hai
 Broadly understand that where the first 500 Rs
 kaa jurmaana lagata, ab vah 1,000 ru
 Will apply
 sadak suraksha athurity ke par kateredusri taraf, nae kanoon ko lekar sabase mahatvapurn ghoshnaa thi&neshnal athurity for road sefti kii sthapana
 The government still holds on to the formation of the authority, with only Qatar given to it
 sadak suraksha par kaam kar rahe think tanks “seve life foundation” ke sansthaapak piyush tiwari kii suniye, “athorty ke adhyaksh kaa chunaav pehle swatantra panel ke madhyam se hona tha, ab yah kaam mantralay karegaa
 Apart from this, the minister will be its patron
 teesri baat yah he ki athurity kii adhisuchana ko mantralay apni adhisuchana se apraasangik bana saktaa he
 "tiwari is pointing out that the authority whose job is to review the work done for roads through the ministry, how will it be able to remain independent if it is under the ministry?" If there has been a scam in awarding a contract for a road or construction of a road, will the authority not be pressurized by the officials of the Ministry? That means the authority will remain as a puppet in the hands of the ministry
 ghat gaya durghatana mrityu kaa muaavjavidheyak main isse bhi zyada vivaadit praavdhaan he, chauthe draft kii dhara 227(2)
 This section states that the maximum compensation in case of death in a road accident is Rs 15 lakh
 diya jayega, jabaki maujuuda kanoon ke tahat adaalatein sadak durghatana main maut kii surat main paanch lakh ru
 2 crores to Rs
 tak muaavja sunaati rahi hai
 In the current law, compensation is based on a formula that calculates compensation based on the person's age, his estimated income and his responsibilities

 P
 joshi kehete hai, “kanoon ke jitne bhi draft bane hon, is par sarkaar ne hamase koi baat nahin kii
 ”he believes that every aspect of it should be considered along with speeding up the compensation process
 institute for transport research and training (iftarti) ke senior phelo es
 P
 singh sawaal uthaate hai, “muaavje kii adhiktam rakam tay karke sarkaar beemaa companiyon kii lobby ke aage jhuk gai he
 By reducing the amount of compensation in this way, the government will get only criticism and the goodness of the new law will be covered
 ” ek anumaan ke mutabik, third party inshyarens se pichley vitt varsh main beemaa companiyon ko premium ke rup main 14,000 karod ru
 meet
 agar sarkaar har saal sadak durghatana main maut kii sankhya ghataane ke lakshya ko paa leti he or sakht kanoon se zyada se zyada log gadiyon kaa beemaa karaane lagate hai to isse beemaa companiyon kii aamadani doguni ho sakati he jabaki clem ke rup main unhen aaj se do-tihaai kam rakam hi deni padegi
 However, a senior ministry official not only dismisses such speculations, but also assures that the fifth draft will be better than the fourth draft
 toll par sudhaaron kii sud nahinis kanoon se judaa ek paksh agar sadak par chalane vaala aam aadmi he to doosraa paksh vaahan chaalak hai
 The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), the apex body of transporters in the country, has earlier gone on strike in protest against the provisions of heavy fines of the bill
 iske alaava transporter chaahate hai ki nae kanoon main toll kii maujuuda vyavastha main sudhaar ho
 Referring to a report by IIM Kolkata in 2011, the transporters say that the time, fuel and resources wasted in the toll recovery process is Rs 87,000 crore a year
 ke rajasav kaa nuksaan hota he
 If the time is not wasted on the toll, then trucks can travel 400 to 450 km instead of 300 km on an average in a day
 iskaa samaadhaan sujhaate hue eiemtisi ke mahasachiv naveen gupta kehete hai, “ham toll ke khilaaf nahin hai
 We only want that the government collects a one-time advance toll tax while issuing and renewing the national permit
 aisa karne se toll dhaanche par hone vaala sarkari kharch bachegaa, saath hi desh main maal dhulaai kii raftaar bhi dedh guni ho jaaegi
 "but these problems, suggestions and their solutions will be revealed only when the government will introduce the bill in Parliament and make it law
" lekin sarkaar pichley ek saal se beemaa companiyon, vaahan nirmaataa companiyon or transportron ke pressure group se samvaad main is kadar uljhi he ki uski ghoshnaaon kaa krantikari kanoon amal main aane se pehle hi kamjor hota ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, the implementation of the remaining important announcements of the Bill will also be questioned
 vidheyak main prastaav he ki license jari karne kii prakriya puure desh main ek-si hogi, artio kaa jang laga system badla jayega, desh main ekikrut vaahan panjikaran vyavastha lagu kii jaaegi
 Many similar ambitious things are included in the Bill
 lekin in par to sansad main charchaa hi shuru nahin hui
 Reacting to the frequent delays in getting the law, the late Munde's daughter and MP from Beed, Maharashtra, Pritam Munde says, "it is not just a matter of law
" hamen sadak par apni aadaton ko badalanaa hoga or sadakon ko is laayak bananaa hoga ki ve durghatnaon ko nyotaa na den
 "after the father's death, Pritam and the whole family never forgets to tie a seat belt in a car
 aise main behatar yahi hoga ki sarkaar ko sadak suraksha kanoon ke draft banane ke liye chhod diya jaae or aam aadmi apni suraksha ke liye khud hi civik sens viksit kare kyonki munde sahab ne agar seat belt baandhi hoti to shaayad ve aaj hamaare bich hote

 An English magazine revelation over the company of Vivek Doval, son of National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, has created a political stir
 congress netaa or purv kendriya mantri jairam ramesh ne ashanka jaahir karte hue kaha ki notebandi or tex hewan ke jariye bharat main paisa aane ke bich jarur koi sambandh he, jisaki jaanch honi chahie or ajit dobhaal ko is maamle main spashtikaran dena chahie
 Jairam Ramesh said that the son of Ajit Doval, who wrote a report on black money, is caught in this trap and the entire Congress leader has dubbed the entire matter as 'd-company'
 darasal ek angreji magazine ne khulaasa kiya tha ki 8 november 2016 ko pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara notebandi kii ghoshnaa ke 13 din baad yani 21 november 2016 ko NSA ajit dobhaal ke bete vivek dobhaal ne tex hewan caman island main jienvai asia fund naam kii hej fund (nivesh nidhi) company kaa panjikaran karaayaa
 The Cayman Islands are known as tax havens
 magazine ke mutabik vivek dobhaal kaa yah vyavsaay unke bhai shaury dobhaal ke vyavsaay se judaa he
 Please tell that Shaurya Doval is the head of the India Foundation, a think tank considered close to the Modi government
 khulaase ke mutabik company ke panjikaran ke baad caman island se bharat main videshi nivesh ke taur par sabase adhik paisa aayaa
 Between April 2017 and March 2018, 8300 crore rupees came to India in just one year, which was 2,226 percent more than before
 congress netaa jairam ramesh ne kaha rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar modi sarkaar ke shashan kii trimurti hai
 In 2011, the Bharatiya Janata Party formed a committee on black money, secret banks and tax havens
 jisamen ajit dobhaal ne ek report likhi thi ki tex chori ke addon par karrwai honi chahie
 GNY Asia has 2 directors, one is Vivek Doval and the other is Don W
 Ebanks
 ibanks kaa naam paradise papers main saamne aa chukaa he
 Both Ajit Doval's sons are trapped in the web of GNY Asia and it is exactly like d-company
 unhone ajit dobhaal ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki jo maang unhone 8 saal pehle kii thi use puraa karen
 Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that in 17 years from 2000 to 2017, Cayman Island receives FDI of 8300 crores
 lekin april 2017 se march 2018 main maatr ek saal main caman island se 8300 karod rupaya aayaa
 That is, FDI that comes from Cayman Island in 17 years, almost that much money came from Cayman Island in one year
 purv kendriya mantri ne bhartiya rigerv bank se maang kii he ki arabiai is baat kaa vivaran prakashit kare ki ek saal main caman island se jo paisa aayaa wo koun lekar aayaa
 Jairam Ramesh said that the money that came in 17 years came in 12 months and that too after the establishment of demonetisation and GNY Asia Fund
 unhone kaha ki notebandi or tex hewan se paisa aana, donon ke bich kuch na kuch tallukaat he, isaki jaanch honi chahie or ajit dobhaal ko is maamle main spashtikaran dena chahie
 Ramesh said that we demand that the National Security Advisor do self-determination and extract his own report and implement it

 mausam ke jaankaron kaa kahana he ki 23 janvari se uttar pashchim himalay main ek western disturbance apana asar dikhaane lagegaa
 This Western Disturbance is very powerful
 khaas baat yah he jis samay yah western disturbance uttar bharat kii taraf badhegaa us samay rajdhani dilli or aasapaas ke ilaakon main bengal kii khadi se aa rahi nam hawaaen bhi pahunch rahi hai or isi ke saath yahaan par arab sagar se aa rahi hawaaen gujarat hote hue daakhil ho rahi hai
 In this situation, the Western Disturbance will be confronted with moist winds coming from the Arabian Sea as well as moist winds from the Bay of Bengal
 is vajah se uttar pashchim himalay ke saath-saath uttar bharat ke maidani ilaakon main badalon kii awajahi bad jaaegi
 The dangerous thing here is that the moist winds coming from the Arabian Sea are entering the mountains of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh at a 90 degree angle
 is vajah se jammu kashmir or himachal ke tamaam ilaakon main baari se bahut baari barish or barfbaari hone kaa andeshaa he
 The severity of the situation can be gauged from the fact that the weather models run by super computers are showing that from 25th to 27th, there can be heavy snowfall of 100 cm to 150 cm in many areas of the Himalayas
 is
 himachal pradesh kii baat karen to yahaan par 24 or 25 janvari ko kai ilaakon main baari se bahut baari barfbaari or barish hone kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 This series of rain and snowfall will continue on 26 January in all areas of Himachal
 vahiin uttarakhand kii baat karen to yahaan par kuch jagahon par 25 or 26 janvari ko baari se bahut baari barfbaari or barish hone kaa anumaan he
 With this, if we talk about the plains, the weather will change from 24th night in Punjab, Haryana and adjoining areas of North Rajasthan, and by the morning of 25 January, rain will start in many areas
 mausam ke jaankaron kaa kahana he in sabhi jagahon par 25 or 26 taarikh ko kai ilaakon main baari barish bhi ho sakati he
 Weather on 25th and 26th will also change in all areas of Delhi NCR and it will continue to rain intermittently during this period
 khaas baat yah he in sabhi ilaakon main barish ke dauraan tej hawaaen bhi chalengi
 According to the Indian Meteorological Department, rain is expected to rain at some places over northern Rajasthan, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh on January 25 and 26
 jab yah wedar system aage nikal jayega to 27 janvari se lekar 29 janvari ke bich uttar bharat ke maidani ilaakon main taapmaana main 2 se 4 degree celsius kii giravat aegi

 inflation ke hisaab se dekhenge to das saal kii mehnat ke baad kailash gadhwal jahaan the vahiin hai
 Rather, they have become poor while working
 aapako ek atithi granthpal kii patni kii baat sunaate hai
 Now we want to take you to the house of Guest Assistant Granthal Kailash Vishwakarma
 inhen 500 rupee prati kaarydiwas miltaa he
 You see the house of Vishwakarma
 ek bistar se zyada rakhane kii jagah nahin he
 The kitchen is inhabited by three or four pots in a corner
 kailash vishwakarma 2007 main privet college main kaam karte the jahaan 15000 miltaa tha, sarkari naukari main theke par aa gaye yah soch kar ki kabhi naukari pakki hogi or selary badhegi
 Ten years ago they used to earn 15000 of the month, today they earn 12000
 3000 kam ho gai
 In a way, their earnings have reduced by about 40% in ten years
 das saal kii mehnat ke baad garib ho gaye
 You look at the picture of their house and guess whether people's lives are changing or not
 aapane chunaavon main wo poster dekhe hai, milegaa sabko kaam, ab nahin hoga palaayan
 Why does the leader sell hope in elections, because that is the time to sell hope
 aakhir jab jidipi badhane kaa daawa ho rahaa he, aarthik tarakkee kaa daawa ho rahaa he to kailash gadhwal or kailash vishwakarma kaa jivan str kyon nahin bad rahaa he
 Where Viswakarma lives, he is accompanied by two more visiting scholars
 shahar se dur haive par ham aapako ek makaan main le chalanaa chaahate hai
 There is no house nearby
 kanshiram prajapati snaatak ke chaatro ko ganit padhaate hai, kamare main unki zindagi main ganit kaa koi namonishaan nahin bachaa he
 He has the same life after teaching in college for two years
 maheene main 12000 hi kama pate hai, usamen bhi saal ke chaar maheene kuch nahin miltaa he
 If you are unable to pay the rent, then there is pressure to vacate the room
 ganit kaa lekturer hone ke baad bhi iskar daata kii haisiyat main nahin aa sake hai
 Without family support, it becomes difficult to spend four months without salary
 kanshiram prajapati kii shaadi ho chuki he, ek baccha bhi he
 You can gauge the financial status of a master who teaches mathematics to about 100 students from the first year to the third year
 kanshiram prajapit ke paas kisi prakaar kaa beemaa bhi nahin he
 One is compelled to teach Mathematics in the college for Rs
 12000
 hoga kuch nahin yah sochakar yah series band nahin kii ja sakati, kam se kam ham janata ke rup main apni haalat to dekh hi sakate hai
 You can only calculate what the result of Zindabad and Murdabad was 
 aapane jin atithi vidwaanon kii haalat dekhi wo indore se 160 kimi dur agar malwa zile ke susner kasbe ke ek kalege main padhaate hai
 Susner is situated on the border of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh
 is kalege kaa naam vivekanand shaskeey mahavidhyalay he
 In the name of making the idol of Vivekananda, political parties will riot in this country, will declare to make an idol of several hundred crores, but will not improve the condition of teachers teaching in the college named after him
 jab shikshakon kii ye haalat he to phir is desh main shikshak diwas kyon manaaya jaataa he
 Sandeep Tiwari of Sagar's Dainik Bhaskar has published a report
 is report ke anusaar madhya pradesh ke 435 kalejon main 4 lakh 43 hazaar chaatr pard rahe hai
 The UGC guideline is that 30 students should have one teacher
 ujisi kii guideline ke hisaab se 15000 shikshak hone chahie
 But the number of sanctioned posts for teachers in Madhya Pradesh is only 9,246
 aavashyaktaa se 6000 kam pad sweekrut hai
 The 9246 posts approved are also not filled
 shikshakon ke 4385 shikshakon ke pad khaali hai
 2461 posts for Assistant Professors are going to be reinstated by Higher Education Department
 dainik bhaskar kii report ke anusaar madhya pradesh main 30 kalege aise hai jahaan ek bhi niyamit shikshak nahin he
 Is this not a joke with the youth of India? kya naujavaanon ne apane saath yah majaak nahin hone diya
 Why didn't he ask why the college he went to did not have a teacher
 atithi vidwaanon kaa shoshan nahin hota to madhya pradesh ke kalege jitne chal rahe hai utane bhi nahin chal pate
 The state government must have saved the education budget by giving them half the salary
 is bharam main na rahe ki yah haalat madhya pradesh main hi he, dilli uniwarsity se lekar bihar upi rajasthan har jagah he
 The comments agar malwa se 250 kimi dur he bhopal ke neshnal lau institute uniwarsity main chaatr 9 november se andolan kar rahe hai
 Students have put up posters of their demands everywhere on campus
 unki 50 maangen hai jinamein se ek he uniwarsity ke nideshak ko tatkaal hataaya jaae
 The patron of this college is the Chief Justice of India
 NILU madhya pradesh ucch nyaayalay or neshnal jeudicial ekademi ke saath milakar kaam karata he
 The students allege that the director comments on the girls' attire
 yahaan tak kaha he ki kya ve apni izzat or shame bechakar ai hai
 Students say that there is no action on caste, gender discrimination on campus
 pariksha kii kapi bhi thik se nahin janchi gai jiske kaaran kai chaatr fail hue hai
 500 students are adamant on their movement
 bhopal se bijepi ke saansad alok sajar ne in chaatro kaa samarthan kiya he or kanoon mantri se baat karne kaa aashwaasan diya he
 The director says that he has not been accused for 9 years during his ten-year tenure
 achaanak kya he
 Some students seem to be trying to tarnish his image
 nideshak kaa kahana he ki chaatro kii zyaadaatar maangen maan lee gai hai
 The director's curriculum vitae is also very strong
 pehle chaatro ko suniye phir nideshak kaa paksh bhi aapke saamne hoga
 The awareness of the students of the law college is so much that they are agitating for the wrong right, there are no teachers to teach in the state colleges here, but no one knows
 hamaare noujvaan whatsap or fasebuk par biji hai
 They do not know what it means to ask for themselves, so when someone raises another question, many of them come to Facebook and start abusing why they are asking questions
 shaayad unka yah matlab hoga ki chupchaap jaise ham barbaad hue hai, vaise hi tum bhi barbaad hote rahe
 Kailash Prasad Garhwal's house is not in any good area
 kailash ji jis ghar main hamen le ja rahe hai wo aath bate das foot kaa hi he
 You look into a life and see what the expectation of a job does to someone
 sarkaron ke berojgaare dur karne ke naare itane khokhale hai ki vah rojgaar bhi detii he to berojgaar se bhi badtar haalat bana detii he
 Three rooms work in one room and a family of three lives
 kailash prasad gadhwal, unki patni or ek beti
 2000 is the rent for this one room
 2007 main kailash prasad gadhwal 6000 maheene main kama lete the, aaj 2017 main 12000 kama pate hai
 In ten years, his earnings remained as much
 ek tarah se das saal pehle ve jitna rashan laa sakate the, aaj bhi utana hi laa sakate hai
 This is the life of a guest Granthapal you are watching
 librari science main em phil kiya he, em lib kiya he, iske baad bhi 580 rupee kii dihadi kabhi bhi maheene main 12000 se adhik nahin kamaane detii he
 12000 rent, electricity bill, fees, medicine and ration is all
 pati patni kaa ek beemaa he iske alaava koi seaving nahin he
 When the college is closed in April, till July, Kailash ji goes to the village to do farming
 parivaar ke log saport karte hai
 When the daughter's school opens, then they come to the city
 selary aath maheene kii hi milti he jabaki kiraaya ve baarah maheene kaa dete hai
 Anyway, September and October salary is not available
 das saal kii naukari ke baad bhi kailas gadhwal iskar dene laayak nahin ho sake
 When his monthly income was only 6000 to 12000 then how would he fall in the income tax category
 inflation kaa hisaab lagaayenge to 2007 main jo 100 rupaya tha, uskaa mulya 2017 main 205 se adhik ho jaataa he
 According to this, Kailash ji's month's income did not read at all in ten years
 vah bhi saal ke chaar maheene kii selary nahin milti he
 According to inflation, Kailash Garhwal is where he was after ten years of hard work
 balki ve naukari karte hue garib ho gaye hai
 Tells you about the wife of a guest Granthapal
 ab ham aapako atithi sahaayak granthpal kailash vishwakarma ke ghar le janaa chaahate hai
 They get Rs 500 per workday
 aap vishwakarma kaa ghar dekhie
 There is no place to hold more than a bed
 rasoi kisi kone main teen chaar bartanon se basii hui he
 Kailash Vishwakarma used to work in a private college in 2007 where he got 15000, came on contract in a government job thinking that sometime the job will be fixed and salary will increase
 das saal pehle ve maheene kaa 15000 kamaate the, aaj ve 12000 kamaate hai
 3000 reduced
 ek tarah se das saal main inaki kamai kareeb 40 fisadi kam ho gai
 He became poor after ten years of hard work
 aap unke ghar kii tasviir dekhte chaliye or andaaza lagaaiye ki logon kii zindagi badal rahi he yaa nahin
 You have seen those posters in elections, everyone will get work, now there will be no escape
 netaa chunaavon main ummid kyon bechata he, kyonki ummid bechney kaa vahi time hota he
 After all, when the GDP is being claimed, economic growth is being claimed, then why is the standard of living of Kailash Garhwal and Kailash Vishwakarma not increasing
 vishwakarma jahaan rahete hai unke saath do or atithi vidwaan rahete hai
 We want to take you to a house on the highway away from the city
 aasapaas koi makaan nahin he
 Kanshiram Prajapati teaches mathematics to undergraduate students, there is no trace of mathematics in his life in the room
 do saal se kalege main padhaane ke baad unhen yahi zindagi hasil he
 Only 12000 are able to earn in a month, in that even four months of the year nothing is found
 kiraaya nahin de sake hai to cameraa khaali karne kaa dabaav bana rahata he
 Despite being a lecturer in mathematics, he has not been able to become an income tax payer
 parivaar kaa saport na hota to chaar maheene bina selary kii zindagi bitaani mushkil ho jaati he
 Kanshiram Prajapati is married, also has a child
 pratham varsh se lekar tritiy varsh ke kareeb 100 chaatro ko ganit padhaane vaale master kii aarthik haisiyat kaa andaaza aap kar sakate hai
 Kanshiram Prajapit does not even have any type of insurance
 12000 rupee main kalege main koi ganit padhaane ke liye majaboor he
 Thinking that nothing will happen, this series cannot be closed, at least we can see our condition as a public
 zindaabad or murdaabaad kaa nateeja kya niklaa iskaa hisaab to kar hi sakate hai
 The guest scholars you saw teach in a college in Susner town of Agar Malwa district, 160 km from Indore
 susner rajasthan or madhyapradesh kii seemaa par sthit he
 The name of this college is Vivekananda Government College
 vivekanand kii murti banane ke naam par is desh main raajnneetik dal danga kara denge, kai sau karod kii murti banane kaa elaan kar denge magar unke naam par bane kalege main padhaane vaale shikshakon kii haalat main sudhaar nahin karenge
 When teachers have this condition, then why is Teachers' Day celebrated in this country
 sagar ke dainik bhaskar ke sandip tiwari ne ek report chhaapi he
 According to this report, 4 lakh 43 thousand students are studying in 435 colleges of Madhya Pradesh
 ujisi kii guideline he ki 30 chaatro par ek shikshak hone chahie
 According to the UGC guidelines, there should be 15,000 teachers
 magar madhya pradesh main shikshakon ke liye sweekrut padon kii sankhya maatr 9,246 hi he
 6000 posts are less than the requirement
 jo 9246 pad sweekrut hai wo bhi puure nahin bhare hai
 Posts of 4385 teachers are vacant
 ucch shiksha vibhaag dwaara sahaayak pradhyapakon ke liye 2461 padon kii bahaali aane vaali he
 According to the report of Dainik Bhaskar, there are 30 colleges in Madhya Pradesh where there is not a single regular teacher
 kya bharat ke naujavaanon ke saath yah mazaaq nahin he
 Did the youth not allow this joke to happen to them? unhone kyon nahin poocha ki jis kalege main jate hai vahaan shikshak kyon nahin he
 If guest scholars are not exploited, then the colleges of Madhya Pradesh are not able to run as much as they are running
 unhen aadhi selary dekar rajya sarkaar ne shiksha kaa bajet kitna bachaaya hoga
 Do not be afraid that this condition is only in Madhya Pradesh, from Delhi University to Bihar UP Rajasthan is everywhere
 tippaniyan Agar is 250 km away from Malwa, students have been agitating since 9 November at the National Law Institute University in Bhopal
 chaatro ne apni maangon kaa poster campus main har jagah laga diya he
 He has 50 demands, one of which is to immediately remove the director of the university
 is kalege ke sangrakshak bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish hai
 NILU works closely with the Madhya Pradesh High Court and the National Judicial Academy
 chaatro ke aarope hai ki nideshak ladakiyon ke pahanaave par tippanee karte hai
 They have even said that they have come to sell their honor and shame
 chaatro kaa kahana he ki parisar main jatigat, langik bhedbhaav par koi karrwai nahin hoti he
 The exam copy was also not properly examined, due to which many students have failed
 500 chaatr apane andolan par ade hue hai
 BJP MP from Bhopal Alok Sajar has supported these students and assured to talk to the Law Minister
 nideshak kaa kahana he ki das saal ke kaarykaal main 9 saal tak un par koi aarope nahin laga he
 What is the sudden lagata he ki kuch chaatr unki chhavi karaab karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 The director says that most of the students' demands have been accepted
 nideshak kaa biodeta bhi kaaphi tagada he
 First listen to the students and then the director's side will also be in front of you
 lau kalege ke chaatro kii jaagrukta itani to he ki ve galat sahi ko lekar andolan kar rahe hai, yahaan to rajya ke rajya kalejon main padhaane ke liye shikshak nahin hai magar kisi ko uff nahin karnaa aata
 Our youth are busy on whatsapp and Facebook
 unhen pataa hi nahin he ki apane liye maangane kaa kya matlab hota he, isliye jab koi doosraa sawaal uthaata he to inhen main se kai fasebuk par aakar gaali dene lagate hai ki sawaal kyon kar rahe hon
 Perhaps they will mean that you are wasted as quietly as we were ruined
