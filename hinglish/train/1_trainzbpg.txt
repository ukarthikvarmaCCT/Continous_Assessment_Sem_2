 Vijay Mallya had said in the court that he did not have enough money to pay the bank loan of Rs 9200 crore, as all his assets had already been confiscated
 sunwaayee ke dauraan supreme court ne maalya se poocha tha ki aapane jo court main apni sampatiyon ke bare main jaankaree di thi wo sahi he yaa nahin ? kya aapane karnataka hoicourt ke aadesh kaa ulanghan to nahin kiya? kyonki karnataka hoicourt ne apane aadesh main kaha tha ki maalya bina court ke anumati koi bhi tranjection nahin kar sakate
 The Supreme Court had asked the central government how the court order could be enforced against Mallya
 tippaniyan The central government told the Supreme Court that efforts were being made to bring back Mallya
 vahiin SBI ne supreme court ko bataaya tha ki maalya ke upar 9200 karod rupee kaa bakaayaa he

 ek daur tha jab bharat main aatmahatya kii khabaren ek khaas ilaake se aati thim
 Except for sporadic cases, most of the suicides were in Saurashtra region of Gujarat
 tab yahaan khudakushi ke aankadon kii tulana scandinavia se kii jaati thi kyonki us vakt duniya main sabase zyada log unheen deshon main khudakushi karte the
 At that time there were several psychological and medical studies on the possible causes of suicide which were published in academic journals
 saath or sattar ke dashak main ek ajeeb baat tab saamne ai jab saamaajik shodhakarta or patrkaar is ore ishaara karne lage ki saurashtra main ho rahi aatmahatyaon kii prishthbhumi bahut ghinauni thi jahaan adhiktar maamalon main jawan patniyon ko iske liye uksaaya yaa baadhya kiya jaataa tha
 After this, the suicide rate started to decrease and after some time this topic disappeared from the headlines of newspapers and magazines
 shaayad vahaan ke pariwaron ke bare main is kathith dushprachaar ke baad logon ne apni patniyon ko maarane ke or gupachup tareeke khoj nikaale honge
 Suicides returned to public life in India in the eighties and nineties
 shuruyaat main akhabaaron main har hafte khudakushi ke maamle aise chhapane lage goyaa ve alag-alag ghatnaayen hon
 Critics of sporadic movements and the Green Revolution, working only on a few notorious voluntary organizations, sustainable development and organic farming, started a different rant
 unhone is baat kii ore dhyaan khinchaa ki khudakushi ke adhiktar maamle kisaanon se jude the
 They claimed that this time the suicide had become an epidemic and it was spreading not in poor states like Bihar or Uttar Pradesh but in the states where agriculture was successfully modernized and which was fully educated and urban committed to fully industrialized agriculture
 Indians were getting appreciated
 anumaan ke mutabik, pichley dhai dashak main kareeb do lakh kisaan apni jaan de chuke hai or inamen adhiktar maharashtra, andhra pradesh, karnataka, punjab or haryana se hai
 Public outrage is missing on this epidemic
 ise pragati or aadhunikeekaran kii 'saamaanya' keemat ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Once again some psychologists and sociologists have written on this topic in academic journals
 kuch ne to khudakushi kii prakriya ko bharat main manovikaron ke badalte charitra se joda he jo yah dikhaata he ki desh main avsaad sabase badi samasya ban chukaa he
 There are very few writers who have explored the frustration that has spread over the past five decades in Indian farming — a farm that was once known for its tenacity, self-reliance and will, like the agricultural fields of Russia and China
 jaahir he, ham 4,000 saal puraani ek parampara or uske ird-gird panpi jeevanstyli main badlaav ko ab dekh paa rahe hai
 Borrow Indira Gandhi's views on the diagnosis of corruption in India, then we can say that it is a global phenomenon and we cannot do anything about it
 aghoshit sarkari salaah yah di jaati he ki kisaani jeevanstyli ke patan kaa marsia padhane vaale romani or jamini logon se dur rahiye
 By the way, the official position is that Indian farmers are now becoming irrelevant, endangered and used throwbacks
 baharhaal, sawaal yah he ki kya vastav main koi bhi kisaani jeevanstyli ke yogadan kii upeksha kar saktaa he jisane anivaary taur par aadhunik bharat main ek pratirodh or saanskrithik mashaal kaa kaam kiya, jiske chalate yah samaaj apni moulikta ko banaae rakh sakaa? kya yah mahaj sanyog he ki gandhi or tagore donon ne hi apane sapanom ke samaaj main kam-se-kam avadharana ke str par hi ek krishak tatv kii majboot upasthiti kii aakanksha kii thi? kya koi un saath fisadi bharatiyon ko bhul saktaa he jo ab bhi pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se krishi par nirbhar hai?mujhe andeh he ki khudakushi par lanset patrika ke nae adhyayan ke upar is nai mahamari kii lambii chaaya maujuud he, jiske kuch aankadon main kai sach pabast hai
 These figures are not only of India but also of China
 in donon hi samaajon main ek saanskrithik visphot or sabhyataagat mulyon kaa ksharan ho rahaa he
 Its psychological consequences are very heavy
 meraa maananaa he ki bharat main algaav or haashie par jate kuch tabakon main akele khetihar hi nahin, adivasee bhi hai jo puranic kaal se hi hamaari 'ucch' samskruti kaa anivaary prasthaan bindu rahe hai
 They too are suddenly finding themselves irrelevant, surrounded by all the unwanted situations
 itane saare samudaayon ko khaarij kar dena aasaan kaam nahin, iske liye bade majboot manovaigyanik raksha kavach kii jarurat padati he
 It should be no surprise that all the cases of suicide in recent years have no wrinkles on the foreheads of Indians who stare at TV and newspapers oblivious
 udhar, manochikitsak avsaad or atmasamman aadi chizon main lage hai, unhen swaamitv yaa algaav aadi se koi matlab nahin he
 They do not understand that the rugged terrain of desperation is being contrasted with the spreading spheres of self-interest in modern India, through whose spectacle the desperation is seen as a dissatisfaction created by some erring individuals
 yah atmarati ek aisi band or ghutan bhari vaastavik yaa abhaasi duniya kaa nirmaan karti he jiske buniyadi siddhant hai sanathan manoranjit hona, sanathan sampark main rahanaa or sanathan yuva bane rahanaa
 Obviously, areas of suicide and desperation are very, very far from such a world
 ashish nandi saamaajik manovigyaani hai

 Location Zaveri Bazar, Mumbai
 roj tarah mumbai ke opera house ilaake ke javeri bazaar main sab kuch saamaanya tha
 The shutters of the shops were opening as usual and the tea gums were crowded as usual
 achaanak ek johari kii dukaan main sibiai kaa chapa padaa
 But then who knew that this raid in the name of CBI and Income Tax was fake
 kehete hai do teen ghante tak naa to koi dukaan ke andar ja paa rahaa tha or naa dukaan ke baahar aa paa rahaa tha
 In the name of CBI and Income Tax raids, thieves robbers vacated the shop
 akshay kumaar, anupam kher manoj bajpeyi jaise sitaron se saji film'special 26'isi ghatana se prerit he
 This film by director Neeraj Pandey, who made a film like 'A Wednesday', is special because till date the world could not know who were the 26 people who raided and till today no clue of any of them was found
 'special 26'kii is kahani kii padtaal karne ke liye aaj tak kii team pahunch gai us ilaake main jahaan par ye farji chapa padaa tha or khoj nikaala un logon ko jinhone kareeb 25 saal pehle dekha tha 'special 26' live
 These are the people who have seen with their eyes the super thugs whom Akshay Kumar, Anupam Kher and their team are playing on screen today
 yakeen maniye ilaake ko logon ko hawa tak nahin lagi thi
 He came to know the next day by watching newspapers and television and the jeweler in his area was robbed
 chapa maarane vaale 26 log the
 All of them fake
 lekin kamaal kaa talmail tha ek bhi kamjor kadi kisi ke haath nahin lagi
 Such a vicious thug in the history of cheating that the world does not even know his name till today
 25 saal ho gayi ab un super thagi ko
 Now only things are left
 sirf kisse sunaaye jate he un thagon ke
 So is there no police record of that incident? The case is 25 years old
 mumbai ke dibi maarg police stesan main ab us 'special 26' cese kii file kaa koi pataa nahin
 Police says we have only 20 years old record at this time
 lekin haa ye sach he ki ipisi kii dhara 420, 471 or 34 jaisi kai sangeen dhaaraon ke tahat agyaat logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kiya gaya tha
 The matter was first investigated by the police and then the case was transferred to the CBI in 1987
 or maamle kii jaanch kaa jimmaa diya tab ke sibiai krimebranch ke afisar sonar ko
 CBI was also left running in the air
 lekin shaatir thagon kii gandh bhi nahin mili
 Obviously if the police talk about that then what to do
 lekin haa usne ye zarur bataa diya 19 march 1987 kii is farji red kii file ko e shrenee main rakhaa gaya he yani ki cese darj hua lekin jaanch kisi nattejey par nahin pahunch saki
 Super thugs were fully prepared
 unke paas un netaaon or kaarobaariyon kii list thi jinke paas jamkar kalaadhan tha
 Perhaps this is the reason why only thirteen cases could come up
 baaki kitne logon ko unhone lutaa ye to vahi jane
 The 80s was nothing short of trouble for politicians and businessmen with black money, because thugs were well aware that hardly anyone could complain about their handiwork to the police
 un thagon ke bare main sirf andeshaa hi tha ki un special 26 main koi naa kaai zarur sibiai kaa ritred adhikari rahaa hoga
 Any Retired Income Tax Officer
 varna kise pataa kiske paas kitna nakad milegaa or kitne kii sampatti
 There was so much chaos that the government was looking for ways to extract black money
 special 26 kaa sabase dilachasp kissa ye he ki ek baar thagi main unhone asli police adhikari ko bhi apane oparation main shaamil kar liya tha
 And by the time the real policemen came to know that the thugs had also indulged in their crime, the ground had slipped from under his feet
 chaunkaanewaali baat to ye thi ki special 26 ke liye jo team banaai gai thi uske liye baqayada akhbaar main vigyaapan diya gaya tha
 It is said that those people who were involved in that operation by the super thugs were not aware that they were being falsely raided in the name of CBI
 netaa ho yaa kaarobaari
 The one who is a thief will be scared
 usee dar ko thagon ne apana hathiyaar bana liya or dhadadhad unki napak daulat ko apane naam kar liya or ek aisi duniya main jaakar chup gayi jahaan tak pahunchane kii himmat kisi ne nahin kii
 And if we had done it, we would not have known what other secrets would have opened
 shaayad yahi vajah he ki assi ke dasak kii thagi ke wo maamle aaj bhi e shrenee main hai yani ki jinka koi nateeja nahin niklaa

 Explaining the statement of sitting in opposition instead of forming a government in Jharkhand with Shibu Sorenne-led JMM, BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy said on Monday that it was his personal view and now he is fully party on the issue Are with the decision of
 rudi ne kaha ki unhone kolkata main jab yah bayaan diya tha us samay dilli main bhaajapa sansadeey board jharkhand ke khandit janadesh ke sambandh main teen vikalpon par vichaar kar rahaa tha, jisamen vipaksh main baithna shaamil tha
 Other options were to support the government from outside or join the government
 unhone apane vivaadaaspad bayaan ke sandarbh main spashtikaran dete hue kaha ki us samay tak party kisi nirnay par nahin pahunchi thi
 He said that the task of choosing one of these three options was left to the central leadership and state leadership of the party visiting Jharkhand
 apane spashtikaran main unhone kaha ki jamini vaastaviktaa kaa gauge lene par yah nirnay kiya gaya ki jhamumo or ajasu se milakar sarkaar banaai jaae
 Rudy expressed his views on Jharkhand at the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad conference held in Kolkata on December 26, saying that the BJP should sit in the opposition in the absence of a clear mandate
 unhone kaha ki unke aisa kehane tak bhaajapa ne jharkhand par koi faisla nahin kiya tha
 The UPA Government's decision to reduce the age limit in the Civil Services Examination has been reversed by the Modi Government
 sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki sarkaar upiessi pariksha dene vaale chaatro kii umr seemaa ghataane se sambandhit koi faisla nahin karne vaali he
 The age limit of the candidates will be the same as before
 isse pehle aise kayaas lagaae ja rahe the ki modi sarkaar upie-2 ke dauraan umr seemaa ghataane ke faisle par amal kar sakati he
 According to a government spokesperson, the government has not taken any decision to reduce the age limit in the civil service
 isse pehle bhi kai baar civil seva pariksha main umr ghataane par vichaar kiya ja chukaa he
 But the age limit was not reduced in view of the possibility of loss to students from rural areas
 sarkaar ke ek adhikari ne bataaya ki pichhali sarkaar ke liye kisi bhi faisle ko lagu karne se pehle uski samiksha kii jaaegi
 The entire process will be followed before making any decision
 nitish kumaar ke gathbandhan ke pachadon se dur rahane kii koshishon ke peeche anubhav ke aadhaar par nikaala gaya ek nishkarsh yah bhi he ki nitish ko upendra kushvaha ke chale jane se bhi fark nahin padane vaala he, jabaki unka maananaa he ki jab tak centre main BJP kii sarkaar he, tab tak maanjhi kam se kam lalu prasad yadav ke saath nahin jaaenge
 On the other hand, if his son Santosh Manjhi gets political adjustment, then he can merge his party with BJP only
 doosraa, nitish yah bhi maanate hai ki maanate hai ki jab tak ramvilas paswan bhi rashtriya loktantric gathbandhan (NDA) ke saath hai, tab tak bihar main NDA ummidavaaron ko jeet ko lekar koi duvidha yaa pareshaani nahin honi chahie, kyonki jab paswan NDA ke khilaaf lalu ke saath the, tab bhi loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaavon main NDA kii jeet hui thi, or ab to paswan bhi RJD ke virodh main hai
 Therefore, it is clear that after renouncing all the aspirations of national politics, Nitish Kumar, who once again formed a government with BJP in Bihar, will run the government on his own terms as per his programs
 yah baat to nitish kumaar ke virdohi bhi maanate hai ki apane is bayaan se CM ne sandesh bheja he ki jab vah lalu ke saamne nahin jhuke, to ab ek-ek vidhayak vaale maanjhi or kushvaha ke dabaav main rahakar gathbandhan kaa netaa nahin bananaa chaahate

 tabase hi sanghathan ke sabhi pramukh netaaon se unka ghanishtha parichay rahaa he

 During that time he had successfully completed many projects of various organizations and government

 unki koshishon ke baad raajnneeti ke ek syah paksh or usase jude logon par badi karrwai tak baat pahunch gai

 bijepi banane ke turant baad se yani saal 1981 se hi vah party main hai
 He had a significant stake in the team that decides the party's policies
 party se judi kai think tanks se unka sidhaa judaav he
 9
 saal 1984 se 1990 ke bich bhartiya janata yuva morcha (bijevyem) ke mahasachiv or rashtriya sachiv rah chuke hai
 Apart from this, he has also successfully conducted many big campaigns in bjp's Maharashtra unit
 10
 Along with all this, his closeness with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also a big reason for his promotion
 piem modi kii ahm pahalon kaa sabase pehle samarthan karne or us par amal kii shuruyaat main jaavdekar aage rahete hai
 The biggest example of this is his efforts on the Ganges River
 iske alaava party kii ore se narendra modi ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar banaae jane vakt bhi jaavdekar behad santulit dikhe the
 Political rhetoric abounds on Congress President Rahul Gandhi's decision to contest from the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat (kerala) as well
 lekin hakeekat yah bhi he ki rahul yahaan se sirf is vajah se nahin lard rahe hai kyonki yah congress ke liye surakshit seat he
 From astrology, political issues and the strong showing of the Congress party, the Congress President has chosen this seat for himself
 rahul gandhi ke nikatatam ranneetikaron kaa kahana he ki congress adhyaksh ne vynad se chunaav ladane man pichley saal disambar main hi bana liya tha
 This advice was given to Rahul by former Defense Minister and former Kerala Chief Minister AK Antony after the Congress's victories in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh
 is saal janvari main rajasthan ke prasiddh jyotish ne rahul gandhi ko yah salaah di ki congress party ke liye dakshin bharat bhaagyashaalee he
 Even before this, when the Congress was voted out of power in 1977, in 1980, on the advice of astrologers, Indira Gandhi won from Medak seat in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana) and the Congress gained power
 iske baad tatkaaleen congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi 1999 main karnataka ke bellari se jeet kar ain
 However, the Congress did not return to power and had to wait till 2004 to gain power
 pichley paanch saal se satta se baahar rahane ke baad congress ek baar phir se dakshin bharat se bhagya parivartan kii ummid lagaae baithi he
 Apart from astrology, Wayanad was also the only option left in South India for Rahul Gandhi in political terms
 karnataka or tamilnadu donon rajyon kii kisi seat se ladane main do pench the
 The first screw was the Cauvery watershed between these two states
 yadi rahul in donon rajyon main se kahin se bhi ladate to vipaksh kaveri jal-vivaad kaa mudda uthaata
 In such a situation, it would have been difficult for Rahul Gandhi to favor any state
 duusari dikkat yah bhi he ki yadi rahul in donon main se kisi bhi rajya se ladate to yah sandesh jaataa ki congress chunki dakshin ke rajyon main apane dam par jeetne laayak nahin he
 Therefore, Rahul Gandhi has come here to contest elections with the help of his allies (JDS and DMK)
 andhra pradesh rahul ke lihaaj se surakshit rajya nahin he kyonki yahaan ke log vibhaajan ke liye congress ko jimmedaar maanate hai
 As for Telangana, winning in front of TRS is the biggest challenge for the Congress

 The petitioner informed the court that no response has been filed in the case from the governments of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh

 yachika main kaha gaya tha ki 10 mukhya gavaahon main se teen kii hatya ho chuki he or shesh saat par jaanaleva hamale ho chuke hai
 The petition also demanded that a CBI inquiry should be conducted by Asaram and his son Narayan Sai regarding Tantra Puja
 yachika main aarope lagaaya gaya he ki ve donon tantra puja kisi chote bachche kii laash ke saamne karte hai
 US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the nuclear deal with Iran a failure during Obama's time, saying that uncontrolled Iran could be the second North Korea, but he stopped saying that any threat to this historic agreement is

 The Trump administration does not intend to leave the responsibility of Iran's case to the future administration
 unhone kaha ki iran kii parmaanu mahatvakanksha antarrashtriya shanti or suraksha ke liye gambhir khatra he
 The tough stand taken by Tillerson came a day after the Trump administration told Congress that Tehran was following talks by former President Barack Obama in 2015 on a nuclear deal that would limit the nuclear capacity of the Islamic Republic Is about tehran ko bataaya aatankwaad ko pryojit karne vaala deshprashasan ne kaha ki isane apane parmaanu kaarykram par niyantran lagane ke badale main iran par lage pratibandhon main di jane vaali raahat ko badha diya he
 Iran has been saying that its nuclear program is completely civil and its supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei warned in November that Tehran would retaliate if the US violates the nuclear deal
 tilorsan ne is vichaar par samarthan bhi maanga ki america pashchim asia main iran ke asthirataa vaale vyavhaar kaa balpurvak muqabla kare
 He also described Tehran as a major country sponsoring terrorism
 unhone kaha ki saakshyon se spasht he ki iran kii uksaave kii karrwai america, kshetra or duniya ke liye khatra he
 Tillerson said that there is a possibility that uncontrolled Iran has walked on the same path that North Korea has followed and can take the world along
 america duusare saboot ko nazarandaaj karne kaa utsuk he
 In such cases the notion of creating strategic patience fails

 " Karan Johar's controversial film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil' was released on Friday
 hindu sena ke kaaryakartaaon ne dariyaganj ke dilite cinema par is film ke khilaaf pradarshan kiya
 Hindu army activists are angry with Pakistani actors working in the film
 virodh ke dauraan pradarshnakariyon ne film ke poster or binar jalaaen
 Hindu army worker Vishnu said that whenever a Pakistani artist would work in any film, then we would oppose it
 hindu sena ne film'i dil he mushkil'ko turant cinema gharon se utaarne kii apil kii he
 Let me tell you, a few days ago, a lot of controversy arose due to the work of Pakistani artist Fawad Khan in the Karan Joharki film 'ae Dil Hai Mushkil Mein'
 manase adhyaksh raaj thakare kii aguwai main sena ke fund main paanch karod rupaya dene ke baad main yah samjhauta hua ki manase mumbai or maharashtra main film ke relies kaa virodh nahin karegi, lekin dilli main hindu sena ke kaaryakartaaon ne film kii relies kaa virodh kiya
 The US military may soon see a major change
 america sainya sevaayen mahilaon ko agrim morchon par duty kii anumati de sakati hai
 It also includes responsibilities in combat operations, deployment in Special Operation Force
 sabhi sevaaon se maangi reporthaal hi main do mahilaon ne america sena kamushkil ranger test paas kiyaahai
 However, the road ahead is quite difficult, dangerous and difficult for them
 shuruaati jaankaree ke mutabik, thal sena, nausena or vayusena teenon hi un kshetron main badlaav kar sakate hai jahaan mahilaon kii tainaati kii anumati nahin hai
 However, the Marine Corps is still set to seek exemption from the deployment of women in the Infantry
 sabhi sevaaon kii ore se apni reportein taiyaar karai ja rahi hai
 Their recommendations will go to the Defense Minister
 haalanki, abhi ye sari charchaaen vibhaagon ke bich hi chal rahi hai
 Attempts to form Accrai, but the Marines may face opposition from senior officials of the Navy and the Department of Defense on the matter, who believe that all departments should take a decision on the matter from Acarai
 special oparation cmand mahilaon ko military commando job ke liye daud main shaamil hone kii anumati dene ko taiyaar dikh rahaa he
 It also includes the Navy Seal and the Army's Delta Force
 haalanki in sevaaon tak pahunchane ke liye jaruri anubhav hasil karne main abhi kai saal kaa vakt lag saktaa he
 Women connected in many areas, however, military services are rapidly changing in the US for some time
 mahilaayein sena se judi vibhinn sevaaon main teji se aage bad rahi hai
 Which also includes the Army's 160th Special Operation Aviation Regiment
 160veen special oparation aviation regiment ko helicopter daste ke rup main janaa jaataa he or laden ko maarane ke oparation main navy cills ko thikaane tak le jane kii jimmedaari nibhaai thi
 Women are also working in Navy Submarine and Army Artillery units
 badlaav kii shuruyatshuukravaar kaa din america itihaas main ek ahm din ke rup main judaa jab do mahilaayein georgia ke fort bening se graduate huin
 These women have joined the US military services after passing two months of tough razor tests
 is dauraan unhone mushkil yudhak prashikshan bhi hasil kiya
 On the strength of their hard work, these women wore Ranger Black and Gold tabs but did not become part of the th Ranger Regiment
 ye sari charchaaen na keval america main mahilaon kii badalati bhoomika par focus karke hai balkisainya sevaaon main bhi bade badlaavaki suchak he
 So far, the role of women in the Navy and Air Force has also been limited to only a few sectors
 kai sevaaon se dur rakhane kii sifarishpichley saal america navy ne is maamle main anumati maangi thi jiske mutabik mahilaon ko puraane gided missile fregates, mine-countermajor ship or petrol coast craft jaisi sevaaon se dur rahane kii baat kahi gai thi
 All these facilities are going to be phased out in the coming few years and it will cost a lot to develop the facilities required for women
 ise kaaran bataakar in sevaaon se mahilaon ko dur rakhane kii daleel di gai thi
 It will take time, but Naval Secretary Ray Mabus withdrew the plan last month
 ye baat samaj lee gai ki isi tarah ke anya jahaajon par mahilaayein pehle se hi duty kar raheen hai
 This year, the Marine Corps formed a task force whose responsibility was to create a standard job environment to include women in various teams
 sena kii ore se bhi isi tarah kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karaayaa gaya tha
 In which a list of all the tasks required for combat duty was prepared
 iske aadhaar par sainya sevaaon ke liye maanak taiyaar kiye gaye hai
 However, avenues have also been opened for women in artillery and some other services in the army

 Even though Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is talking about the investigation in the case of Zafar Khan's death due to open defecation during the cleanliness campaign, but in our investigation only the name of the investigation has surfaced
 SFL report se hoga khulaasagefar ke gharavaalon ne paanch sarkari karmchaariyon par jafar ko peet-peet kar maarane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 But the police is saying that we will take any investigation and action only after getting the SFL report, because doctors have written that the real cause of death will be known only after the SFL investigation
 magar jab hamane SFL ke nideshak ke report ke bare main poocha to kaha ki hamen police ne jaldi jaanch report ke liye koi patr nahin bheja he or bina police ke patr ke ham saamaanya process main ek se dedh maheene main ham report bhejenge yani tab tak police kisi par koi karrwai nahin karegi
 a case of murder has been registered on five people
 No action has been taken so far in the case of Zafar Khan's death in Pratapgarh
 jafar ke gharavaalon ne paanch logon ke khilaaf hatya kaa maamla darj karaayaa he
 There is also a video of dozens of eyewitnesses being present on the spot
 lekin police kaa kahana he ki postmortem report main heart atake maut kii vajah he isliye ham kisi ko giraftaar nahin kar rahe hai or aage kii karrwai SFL kii report aane ke baad hi karenge
 Even the police has not made any statement of eyewitnesses while the eyewitnesses in the viral video are clearly visible
 tukdon main video ko kiya gaya viralapulice kaa kahana he hamane video dekha hi nahin he
 Pratapgarh SP Shivraj Meena said that the SFL is awaiting the report
 bada sawaal he ki jis 16 second kaa video rajasthan ke grahamantri gulabchand kataaria or police dikhaa rahi he uskaa puraa video kahaan par he
 When the entire videography has been done by the municipality, then why is the government going viral 16 and 21 seconds in which Zafar is seen attacking
 baaki ke video main aisa kya he jo police or sarkaar chupa rahi he
 The final report will reveal the reason for death
 When we talked to the post mortem doctor about the report, he said that we have given the right report
 hamaare paas pratapgarh main iske aage kii jaanch kii suvidha nahin isliye SFL kii udaipur ke prayogshaala main bheja he
 The cause of death will be known only after the final report
 india today ke sting ke baad report par uth rahe hai savahospataal ke prabharee jairam daayma ne hamaare sting main ye sweekaar kiya ki kisi bhi maut kii vajah heart or langs phelior hi hota he aise main is postmortem se hamen kuch pataa nahin chal paaya he
 Therefore, we have sent all the organs to the FSL Lab in Udaipur
 postmortem report par isliye sawaal uth rahe hai kyonki india today ke sting aaparishan main pratapgarh ke bijepi ke chairman kamalesh doshi ne mana tha ki usne hi paanch logon kaa postmortem board banwaaya tha
 It will take one and a half months for the report to come, after that we talked to the director of the laboratory of Udaipur for further investigation
 vahaan jaakar pataa chalaa ki police to jaanch ke naam par logon kii ankhon main dhul jhonk rahi he
 SFL director Rameshchandra Sharma told that in the medical legal case, if we write a police letter, then we give a report in a day or two, but we have not received any letter from the police in this case, so it takes a month and a half to report in the normal process
 Will go video par uthe sawalis puure maamle main prashasan or bijepi kii taraf se viral kar rahe video par bhi sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir tukade-tukade main khaas-khaas video kyon jari kar rahe hai
 Zafar's daughter present on the spot says that the video of the entire incident was made by the Zilla Parishad employee, so why the police do not investigate the entire video

 This naval exercise involves the most complex deployment of warships, nuclear and conventional submarines, destroyers, frigates and support ships from the Indian and French navies in the Indian Ocean
 karnataka ke tat ke kareeb hawaii yuddhayas se shuru hua 'varun 2019' horn of africa main, jahaan francisi nausena kaa ek base he, vahaan pandubbi yuddhayas ke saath khatm hua
 Senior naval officials who spoke to NDTV said the aerial combat exercise added 'extraordinary training value', with Karwar being attacked on a small island
 is abhyaas kaa samaapan donon pakshon ke ladaaku vimaanon dwaara dweep ke chattni kinare ke saath bane lakshya par hamalaa karne ke saath hua
 The objective of this exercise was to develop a common communication protocol so that French and Indian naval combat aircraft could work together at the time of any confrontation
 haalanki moolbhoot parichaalan main fark abhi bhi kaayam hai
 The electronic data-link in the Indian mig-29k was not compatible with the same system as the French Rafale aircraft
 jiske chalate bhartiya or francisi vimaanon ke bich puri baatcheet radio ke jariye hui
 Indian Navy officials told NDTV that 'gunnery exercises' by both sides were highly successful and both sides successfully targeted their targets
 nausena ke adhikariyon ne bhartiya nausena ke mig-29k or francisi rafel vimaanon ke bich hawaii bhidnt kaa vivaran saajha nahin kiya
 All these exercises were carried out at the Beyond Visual Range of 60 to 80 kilometers in which the Indian Navy reported that they had managed to locate and take out advanced Rafale fighter jets somewhere, although the scores of these exercises were not shared by this correspondent
 haalanki nausena ke sutron ne NDTV se hameshaa kaha he ki kisi bhi abhyaas main donon nausenaon kaa sidhaa saamana nahin hua or donon pakshon ne adhiktam aapasi saamanjasy ke liye sanyukt balon ko tainaat karne kaa nirnay liya
 The Indian Air Force will get some of the 36 Rafale fighter jets in September this year
 usase pehle, bhartiya vayusena apane sukhoi-30 ladaaku vimaanon ko hawa main eendhan bharne vaale vimaanon ke saath july kii shuruyaat main donon deshon ke bich hone vaale 'garud' vayusena abhyaas ke liye france bhejegi
 These aircraft will also fly with and against the Rafale aircraft of the French Air Force, which will give the Indian Air Force an opportunity to get to know this improved aircraft with better arrows so that it is in the process of induction soon
 ab ye tay ho gaya he ki sipiem bengal chunaavon main tiemasi se takkar lene ke liye congress ke saath milakar chunaav ladegi
 It is a coincidence that Sitaram Yechury, the general secretary on Thursday, laid the foundation stone of the new ideological school building of CPM in Delhi in the name of Harkishan Singh Surjeet, called Chanakya of the party and also made a statement that to defeat Mamata Banerjee in Bengal All democratic and secular parties come together
 sawaal yahi he ki kya party bengal chunaavon main tiemasi ko haraane ke liye congress ke saath haath milaaegi
 It is clear from the statement of the CPM general secretary and the decision taken after the meeting of the Central Committee that the CPM has succumbed to the compulsion to join hands with the Congress
 pichley hafte sipiem kii bengal unit ne congress se haath milaane ke maamle main sahmati jataai thi taaki trinmul congress ke khilaaf ladaai main voton kaa bantwaaraa na ho
 But the problem is that along with Bengal, the Kerala Assembly elections are going on where the Left will have to compete directly with the Congress
 kerala ke kamred kah rahe hai ki ek rajya main dosti or duusare main muqabla kaise hoga
 The comments isaliye mana ja rahaa he ki congress auki left milakar ladenge lekin koi aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin hogi
 Some seats will be left for each other and in some seats both will contest elections to defeat TMC
 ye ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 It is being said that CPM General Secretary Yechury and Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi have talked about this, but the question is whether Sonia Gandhi will take the risk of making Mamata Banerjee angry
 vaise bengal main mamata banerjee is vakt siyaasi rup se kaaphi majboot hai or kaha ja rahaa he ki is gathbandhan ke baavjood unki sehat par koi bada asar nahin padane vaala he
 Nevertheless, the comrades of Bengal are saying that the collapsed CPM in the state needs some oxygen, for which these alliances are necessary
 sipiem ke mahasachiv ke bayaan or central cameti kii meeting ke baad huye faisle se saaf he ki sipiem congress se haath milaane kii majaburi ke aage jhuk gai he
 Last week, the Bengal unit of the CPM agreed to join hands with the Congress to avoid the division of votes in the fight against the Trinamool Congress
 lekin samasya he ki bengal ke saath-saath kerala vidhansabha chunaav bhi ho rahe hai jahaan left kii takkar sidhe congress se honi he
 Comrades from Kerala are saying how friendship will happen in one state and competition in another
 tippaniyan It is believed that the Congress and the Left will fight together but there will be no formal announcement
 kuch siten ek duusare ke liye chodi jaaengi or kuch siton par tiemasi ko haraane ke liye donon hi chunaav ladenge
 This is part of the strategy
 kaha ja rahaa he ki sipiem mahasachiv yechuri or congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi main is bare main baat chuki he lekin sawaal ye bhi he ki kya sonia gandhi mamata banerjee ko naaraaz karne kaa jokhim uthaaengi
 However, Mamata Banerjee is very strong in Bengal at the moment and it is being said that despite this alliance, her health is not going to be affected
 phir bhi bengal ke kamred kah rahe hai ki rajya main dharashayi ho chuki sipiem ko kuch oxizan chaiye jiske liye ye gathjod zaruri he

 Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijendra Gupta has alleged that the disqualified assembly member of Najafgarh wants Kailash Gehlot to retain the Chief Minister in the House illegally, which is illegal
 gupta ne kaha he ki siem kejariwal kaa ye kadam gaiyrkanoonee he or is faisle ke khilaafabijepi netauparajyapal, grahamantri or jarurat padane par raashtrapati se shikaayat karenge
 Vijender Gupta has said that he will take up the matter again in the House on Monday 19 March and the court will also be knocked if needed
 vijendra gupta ne diya niyam kaa hawalawijendra gupta nedilli rashtriya rajdhani rajya kshetra shashan adhinium, 1991 ke niyam 43(2) kaa hawala dete hue bataaya ki niyamavali main spasht likhaa he ki koi mantri, jo lagaataar 6 maheene kii kisi avadhi tak vidhansabha kaa sadsy nahin he, us avadhi kii samaapti par mantri nahin rahegaa
 Nowhere is it written in the manual that a member disqualified from the Legislative Assembly can continue for six months in a ministerial position
 sarkaar is maamle main puri tarah gaiyrkanoonee tareeke se gahalot ko banaae rakhana chaahati he
 Last time the marshals had carried out, let us tell you that on March 16, Vijender Gupta had objected to Lt Governor Anil Baijal on the presence of Kailash Gehlot in the house, but at that time the marshals were called and forced out of the house
 pratyusha banerjee kii khudakushi kii khabar ne glamer kii rangeen duniya ko ek baar phir jhakzor kar rakh diya he
 Once again the question has started to be asked whether the result of snapping life comes in the form of loneliness and loneliness? And is failure and anonymity often the cause of death? whatsapp status linked to death inserted 15 days ago is also a coincidence when people usually write such things in their status on Facebook or whatsapp
 'mar ke bhi munh naa tujhse modana' ye pratyusha kaa whatsap states 15 march kaa he
 That is, 15 days before his death
 ab sawaal ye he ki kya ye states mahaj ittefaq he yaa phir isi ek line main balika vadhoo kii anandi yani pratyusha banerjee kii maut kaa raaj chupa he?is chamakati duniya kii chakachaundh ne jitanon ko shoharat kii bulandi par pahunchaaya he, usase kahin zyada logon ko barbaadi ke andhere kuen main dhakela he
 Here successful people put their heads on their eyes, and pick up lonely or unsuccessful people from among them and throw them away so that they neither live in this world of dreams nor in our world and yours
 par anandi ke saath aakhir aisa kya hua ki maut se 15 din pehle usne marane kii baat likh di?kya vajah thi suicide kii?kya chakachaundh bhari glamer kii duniya ke bich bhi akelepan kaa andhera nigal gaya pratyusha ko? kya shoharat kii bulandi se jameen par aa girane ke dar or naakaami or gumnami ke khauf main aakar 24 saal kii pratyusha ne khud hi apni dhadakanen chhod deen? kya kharaab mali haalat se tut gai thi pratyusha? yaa phir rishton kaa dhokhaa kha gaya pratyusha ko? aakhir pratyusha kisase mar kar bhi munh naa modane vaali thi? kahin wo uskaa bwyfrand to nahin? maut se pehle apane bwyfrand se kyon lard rahi thi pratyusha? kya pratyusha ko ye shaq tha ki uskaa bwyfriend kisi or ladki se pyaar karata he?nahin mila koi suicide notepratyusha kii maut achaanak hui he
 Everyone is stunned by the news of death
 sabhi sakate main hai
 Pratyusha did not leave any suicide note before she died
 jaahir he aise main police sidhe-sidhe cese band karne se pehle har shaq or sawaal ko tatolegi
 And there is also groping
 or is shaq or sawaal ke bich me sabase aage khadaa he pratyusha kaa vahi bwyfriend jise kuch log uskaa mangetar bhi bataa rahe hai
 The name is Rahul Raj
 pratyusha kaa vahi bwyfriend jisase pratyusha ne marane se pehle aakhri baar baat kii thi
 With whom she was last seen
 jiske saath wo aakhri baar ladi thi
 And who first reached her after Pratyusha's death
 yani jise pratyusha kii maut kii khabar sabase pehle mili
 So the questions are countless
 jawaab anandi kaa har chaahane vaala jaananaa chahta he
 No third reason was created because of the investigation of Mumbai Police so far, a third girl is mentioned between Pratyusha and her boyfriend Rahul
 us ladki kii vajah se hi in donon ke rishton main kaduvaahat kii baaten bhi saamne aa rahi hai
 And it is also coming to the fore that Pratyusha wrote her last status for Rahul only because of the same girl
 liv-in-relationships main rahete the pratyusha-rahulbaat march ke shuruuaat kii he
 Pratyusha shifted from Kanchpada area and came to stay in flat number 703 of Harmonic Residency Apartment in Bangurnagar in January this year
 yahaan pratyusha or uskaa bwyfriend rahul saath rahete the
 That is, both were in live-in-relationship
 march ke shuruuaat main isi apartment main saloni naam kii ek ladki ai thi
 To meet Rahul
 kehete hai ki tab saloni ke saath pratyusha kaa kaaphi jhagada hua tha
 Even a scuffle took place
 baad main apartment ke logon ne jhagade kii vajah se police ko bhi bula liya tha
 This case is still registered in Bagunarnagar police station
 hone laga tha pratyusha or rahul main jhagadadarasal pratyusha ko shaq tha ki rahul kaa saloni ke saath afaire he
 And there was always a fight between them about this
 31 march kii raat ko bhi rahuul isi flats main pratyusha ke saath tha
 That night and then the next morning i
e
 on March 1, the sound of quarrel was coming out from Pratyusha's flat
 iske baad ek march kii subah kareeb das baje rahul or pratyusha ghar se nikle
 Together they went to a small mall near the house
 kehete hai ki vahaan bhi donon kaa jhagada hua
 At the root of the quarrel, this time also he was the girl named Saloni
 jhagade ke baad donon saath ghar aae or phir kuch der baad rahuul ghar se akele nikal gaya
 This was their last meeting
 iske baad subah kareeb saadhe gyaarah baje londry vaala ghar par aayaa tha
 Pratyusha then opened the door of the house
 magar uske baad phir kisi ne pratyusha ko nahin dekha
 At four in the evening when Rahul returned to the flat
 usne kaaphi der tak ghanti bajaai par darwaja nahin kholaa
 Pratyusha did not even get out of the house and was not picking up the phone
 lihaaja rahul paas se hi ek chaabi vaale ko bulawaakar usase darwaja khulwaataa he
 The Society's guard was also present
 rahul ne pratyusha ko latakate hue dekhadarwaja khol kar rahul jab andar pahunchataa he to dekhtaa he ki pratyusha bedroom main pankhe se jhul rahi he
 He immediately takes him down
 use lagata he ki pratyusha kii saansen ab bhi chal rahi hai
 So he immediately rushes her to the nearby Kokilaben Hospital
 magar aspataal pahunchane se pehle hi pratyusha kii maut ho chuki thi
 It was around five in the evening
 iske baad rahul sabase pehle pratyusha ke chachaa ko isaki khabar detaa he
 The police gets the news of the accident at around seven in the evening
 pichley kuch dinon se mali haalat thik nahin thirahul se police lambii poochtacha kar chuki he
 From her relationship with Pratyusha, to the marriage, the other girl and the financial condition of the two
 ab agar mumbai police kii maane to march 2015 ke baad se pratyusha or rahul donon kaa hi kariyar lagbhag dhalaan par tha
 Pratyusha, who had become a favorite of house to house overnight by becoming a girl bride, Anandi, suddenly changed everything as soon as Anandi came out of her role
 pichley kai maheenon se donon kii mali haalat bhi thik nahin thi
 If we take the line of police investigation, then the police is currently investigating the case from every angle
 isamen katl bhi shaamil he
 And the reason for this is that the lock in the flat where Pratyusha was kept can open both inside and outside

 BJP veteran and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi attacked the JDU without naming it and said that there is still time for Bihar assembly elections
 aise main endie ko chunavi mod main aane kaa nahin balki yah samay vikaas kaaryon par tavajjo dene kaa he
 This statement of the Deputy CM is being linked to the new poster put up by the JDU
 susheel modi ne twit karte hue likhaa he, 'rajya main vidhansabha chunaav hone main jab ek saal se zyada vakt bachaa he, tab endie ke liye yah chunavi mod main aane kaa nahin, kaarykaal kii shesh avadhi main vikaas ke zyada se zyada kaam karne kaa samay he
 With this, Sushil Modi has dismissed any kind of apprehension of the JDU-BJP alliance
 unhone aage kaha ki hamaare yahaan netritv ko lekar 'na koi sanshay he, na koi antarkalah
 In fact, Sushil Modi's tweet has come at a time when posters have been put up outside the JDU office in Bihar, in which the slogan is written 'why do thoughts, thik to hai Nitish Kumar'
 jediu ke in poster ko lekar bihar main khub charchaa ho rahi he
 In response to JDU, RJD has also released a poster

 In this poster, the map of Bihar state has also written chum fever, flood, murder, dacoity, drought
 bihar main jediu-argedy ke bich chhide poster war par bhi dipti siem susheel modi ne hamalaa kiya he
 Sushil Modi tweeted that all parties have the right to create public opinion through posters
 kuch log janamat bigaadane yaa rajya kii chhavi dhoomil kar niveshkon ko daraane ke liye bhi poster kaa durupyog kar rahe hai
 During the parliamentary elections too many posters were put up, but whom did the public trust, whose posters were put in the trash

 Let me tell you that on Wednesday, Chandrasekhar Rao had threatened to bury the media
 unhone kaha tha ki telugana kii vidhansabha ko bhang karne vaale ko nahin choda jayega, unki gardan marodakar unhen dafna diya jayega
 Javadekar said, 'media freedom is the soul of democracy
 kisi ko bhi media kii swatantraaa ke saath khilwaad nahin karne diya jayega
 The Emergency of 1975 defeated the media
 ' People's faith has been lost from both major political parties of the country
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf hamane kai baar andolan chalaae lekin sarkaar sunne tak ko taiyaar nahin he
 Some political parties are saying that you should win yourself and make your own arbitrary laws
 or jab hamane raajnneetik vikalp dene kii baat kii to in logon ne kahana shuru kar diya ki aap raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 This is to say that Arvind Kejriwal, the soldier of Anna's movement against corruption
 arvind kejariwal india today group ke mind rox youth summit 2012 main yuvaaon ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 On the stage in Arvind said that if the people of the country and you youngsters come forward, change is possible in this country
 india today mind rox summit 2012 main ‘yor india, yor tudeh haau tu mek yor vot and wais count’ seshan ko sambodhit karte hue arvind kejariwal ne congress kii satta ko ukhaad phenkane kii purajor vakaalat kii
 He said, we will not take rest until we overthrow power
 ’arvind ne apane kamishnar banane ke samay kii baat bataai
 Arvind said, 'when i became the commissioner, the whole family distributed laddus in the neighborhood
 kisi ne nahin kaha ki ye inakam tex department main ja rahaa he vahaan bahut kamaayegaa
 'arvind said that the political people of the past were known as patriots but the political people of today have become in power
 arvind ne kaha, ‘baba sahab ambedkar, sardaar ballab bhai patel sareekhe logon ne chunaav ladaa lekin wo deshbhakt the naa ki satta ke laalchee
 'arvind described an incident
 unhone kaha, ‘ek baar main or manish aapas main baat kar rahe the
 The issue was whether politics could change
 vahiin sameep main ek sajjan baithe the
 They were listening to us
 ’main manish se kah rahaa tha, ‘ye raajnneetik kranti hogi, agar ye andolan sansad ke andar pahunchataa he to kisi ko lalabatti kii gaadi, suraksha or bade-bade makaan nahin milane chahie
 They have to live in a one room house
 kota band ho, empi, emele fund band ho’tabhi wo sajjan uthakar mere paas aae or kaha, ‘main aapaki party kaa tikat lene aayaa tha lekin aapaki baaten sunakar yahi lagata he ki jab kuch milanaa nahin he to tikat lekar kya karuunga
 So today, where is the politics, it shows from this
 ye keval kursi kii takat kii raajnneeti he
 'arvind said,' Our movement was a people's movement
 janata kii marji se vikalp dene kii baat kii gai
 Can the Congress party give the country a future? kya bijepi desh ko bhavishya de sakati he yaa koi bhi party desh ko bhavishya de sakati he
 'congress MP Sandeep Dixit was also a speaker in this session and he said in support of Arvind's movement that our institutions have become weak over time
 lekin arvind or unke mitron ke andolan se hamaari raajnneetik sanrachana ko sambhawatah kuch badlaav dekhne ko mili
 He said that your voice is important in politics, 'there is a great need for organizations that influence the voice
 ’arvind ke raajnneeti main utarane kii saraahna karte hue sandip dikshit ne kaha, ‘aashaa hameshaa hi sakaaratmak honi chahie
 There should also be a mirror to show you the face in politics
 aaj aawaaj prabal karne vaali sansthaaen bhi bahut joro se chahie
 This creates a better political structure
 ’unhone kaha, ‘main apni party ke bachaav main kuch nahin kahana chahta hum
 Because i have full faith in the organization i am associated with
 ’ haalanki unhone kaha ki badlaav avashyambhavi he jo behatar raajnneetik vyavastha kaa nirmaan karata he
 Welcoming Arvind's foray into politics, Sandeep Dixit said, 'I welcome your movement and its political form
 lokapal bill banane ke dauraan jis tarah se aap or aapke saathiyon ne kai suzav die or rasta dikhaaya main ummid karata hum ki aapkaa saath raajnneeti ke liye acha hoga
 During the session, when Arvind was asked whether he is confident of getting this ideological success, he gave two examples
 unhone kaha, ‘hamaare andolan ke dauraan ek pulisavaale ne bataaya ki wo rishwat letaa tha lekin anna ke andolan ke prabhaav main usne rishwat lenaa chhod diya
 Similarly, a person's Alto car was stolen which was found during our movement and Anna's sticker was affixed on it and there was a note in the wiper which said that Anna's car Happy Anna
 to jisadin logon main bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jaagarukta aa jaaegi to sudhaar khud-ba-khud ho jayega
 On asking Arvind where the money will come from for campaigning, he said, 'on the day every child and woman of this country starts campaigning for us, where will we need money
 ’arvind ne apane sambodhan ke dauraan kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki ye mauka kho gaya to pataa nahin doosraa mauka kab milegaa
 Maybe another chance will be found after 40-50 years
 ’jab arvind se yah sawaal poocha gaya ki aap kaise achche or eemaandaar log laaenge to arvind ne kaha, ‘ham duusare deshon main chunaav pranali kii study kar rahe hai
 We will publish the details of our candidate on the site and will give people three months time to bring any corruption evidence against our candidate

 ' Team India defeated South Africa by 337 runs in the fourth Test match played at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground
 chaar maichon kii siries ke antim test ke paanchaven din somvaar ko bhartiya gendbaajon ne 481 ranon ke lakshya kaa peechha karti mehmaan team kii pari 143 ranon par samet di
 With this, Team India won the four-test series 3–0
 bharat ne mohali (pehla) or nagpur (teesraa) test keval teen dinon main jeet liya tha jabaki bangaleru test barish kii bhent chadh gaya tha
 Let us tell you the five reasons why Team India won in Kotla
 rahane kaa ‘dabl’kotla test kii pehali pari mentim india kii ballebazildkadaa gai thi
 Six players, including captain Kohli, returned to the pavilion during the first 50 overs game
 duusari chor par khadey ajinkya rahane ne yahaan se wo cricket kheli jo aane vaale dinon main unke kad ko or ooncha karne main bada ahm kirdaar nibhaayegi
 Rahane was then playing for 31 off 55 balls
 yahaan se unhone bagdor sanbhali or phir sanyam kaa behtareen parichay dete hue shatak jamaaya
 During this, he scored 59 runs (18) for the 7th wicket with Ravindra Jadeja
 5 overs) or 8wein wicket ke liye ravichandran aswin ke saath 32
 Played a 98-run partnership in 1 over
 136 ranon ke yoga par chah wicket ganvaa chuki team india rahane ke out hone tak 296 or antat 334 ran banane main kaamyaab rahi
 This big score on the spin wicket laid the foundation of victory
 rahane nedusri parimen bhi shatak lagaaya
 During this, he shared 154 runs for the fifth wicket with Kohli
 ‘nirmam’ captain kohliapane gharelu maidan par pehali baar captaini ke liye utre viraat kohli ne is test ke shuru hone se hi pehle hi do took lahaze main kaha tha ki wo nirmam bane rahenge or siries 3-0 se jeetne kii koshish karenge
 And during the Test he proved it not only as a captain but also as a batsman
 is test main kohli kaa bahut ahm kirdaar tha
 He made a crucial partnership of 70 runs with Rahane in the first innings and then scored 154 runs in the second innings
 pehle teen test maichon main 17 kii ausat se keval 68 ran juta chuke kohli ne akele is test ke dauraan 132 ran banaae
 He remained aggressive even during this test
 fielding ke dauraan unhone amala or divilliars jaise ballebaajon ke saamne atekking fielding sajaai
 Kohli fielded fielders at silly point, silly mid-off and gave the batsmen a one-run lead
 unki atekking fielding sajaavat or jadeja, aswin or yadav kii kasi hui gendbaaji kii badaulat hi match bachaane ke prayaas main lage dakshin africa ballebaajon ne dhimi ballebaaji ke kai anachaahe kirtiman apane naam kiye
 Ashwin had announced his debut on the spin King Ashwinspin wickets on the Sri Lanka tour
 vahaan wo teen test kii siries main 21 wicket lekar main of da siries bane to yahaan wo chaar test kii siries main 31 wicket lekar is puraskaar ke hakdaar bane
 Ashwin did this feat for the fifth time, playing only 12 Test series
 iske saath hi unhone kisi bhi bhartiya cricketer ke sabase adhik main of da siries ke record kii barabari kii
 This record is recorded in the names of Virender Sehwag (38 series) and Sachin Tendulkar (74 series)
 isi test ke dauraan wo africa team ke khilaaf kisi siries main sabase adhik wicket lene vaale gendbaaj pehle hi ban gaye hai
 This was Ashwin's third Test at Kotla and he has taken 23 wickets here, including this test
 abhi pichhali srilanka siries main hi wo sabase tej 150 test wicket lene vaale gendbaaj bane the
 The way he is increasing the number of wickets after each test, it is clear that he will also become the fastest Indian bowler to take 200 wickets in the next few matches
 wo 32 test main 176 wicket le chuke hai
 Jadeja got a new identity in the series of Test matches, where Ashwin took 31 wickets on one side and 'sir' Jadeja dominated from the other end
 mohali kii pich par jo jadeja ne apni phiraki par africa ballebaajon ko nachaanaa shuru kiya wo kotla main bhi jari rahaa
 In both innings of this Test, he not only took the wickets of captain Hashim Amla but also walked a total of seven players including five wickets in the first innings
 duusari pari main unhone jo gendbaaji kii uski jitani tarif kii jaae wo kam he
 In the second innings, Jadeja was played defensively by African batsmen so that he bowled 33 of 46 overs
 yah jadeja kii kasi hui gendbaaji kaa hi kamaal tha ki captain amala ne khaataa kholane ke liye 46 gendon to du plasis ne 52 daat gend khelkar 53veen gend par khaataa kholaa
 On the other hand, de Villiers, famous for the fastest century, also scored 33 runs off 220 balls
 puri siries ke dauraan 23 wicket jhatak kar jadeja ne apni nai pahchaan banaai he
 Yadav's wicket-to-wicket bowling Umesh Yadav's bowling in the second innings showed that if you have an edge in your bowling, then it is not just a sign of green belt
 spin leti wicket par yadav ne tej gendbaaji khilne main nipun africa ballebaajon ko apni speed se maat kiya
 While the ashwin-jadeja pair dismissed the opening batsmen, Yadav cleaned the tail
 pehali pari main yadav ne do to duusari main teen wicket liye
 In the second innings, Yadav performed an unforgettable bowling performance
 africa ballebaaj jahaan ek taraf jadeja kii spin leti gendon se pareshaan rahe vahiin yadav ne unhen ek ek ran ke liye tarasaa diya
 Yadav bowled 21 overs during this period and the African batsmen managed to score only six balls bowled by them
 yani 120 dot ball ke saath unki iconmi keval 0
 She was 42

 Decision to erase confusion: When the Minister was talked to UP Basic Education Officer Ahmed Hassan about this, he said that this condition has been kept so that after the death of the employee, there is no confusion on the woman who is entitled to pension
 unhone kaha, 'aisa galatfahami se bachane ke liye kiya he taaki karmchaaree kii maut ke baad labhaarthi ko lekar koi vivaad na ho
 'the government cannot impose such conditions, however, the Muslim Personal Law Board says that because of this government order, the rights of Muslims are being violated
 lakhanu kii idgah ke imam or board ke sadsy moulana khalid rashid firangi mahali ne kaha, 'staff kii bhartee ke maamalon main sarkaar is tarah kii sharten nahin laga sakati

 The eyes of six hundred hundred officers of the Reserve Bank and other banks from all over the country had come to see Rajan
 puraskaar mili to sirf unase or unke haathon se
 The winners were standing on the stage in such a way that Rajan kept coming in every frame
 rajan sahab ne anya up-governron ko aage kiya ki kuch puraskaar ve bhi den magar vijetaon ko acha nahin laga
 Those who returned happily from Rajan's hands and those who did not find them looked sad on the stage as if the suspension letter was being held
 ant main ek vijeta se rahaa nahin gaya
 Taking the prize from the Deputy Governor went to draw a picture with Rajan
 unke haath main apana maanaptr thama kar muskuraayaa or apane nayak ke saath fremauddh hokar laut aayaa

 The Governor arrived at exactly 5 o'clock and is sitting on the stage
 sunate hi khud se koft hui ki ye teen minute kii deree hui kyon

 i have not seen such attraction towards my head from peon to officer of any institute

 The dignity of the Reserve Bank has always been there, but Rajan has had some effect, due to which the middle level officials were spontaneously cheating

 There was positivity in every voice
 baat-baat main jab maine kah diya ki charchaa to he ki aglaa governor koi or ho saktaa he to aasapaas ke logon kaa munh chota-sa ho gaya

 ye chand awaajen hai, jo maine alag-alag logon se raghuram rajan ke bare main sunin

 Raghuram Rajan was practicing his speech while the other speakers were speaking
 shabdon par nishaan laga rahe the
 The copy of the speech was left on the table
 mujhe laga ki rajan ne roman main likhi hindi padhi he magar unke bhaashan kii copy devanagari main thi
 People in such positions dodge in the name of Hindi
 shaayad chakma dena rajan kii fitarat hi nahin he
 Rajan said, "the work of the official language is not to encourage decorative literature or art
 iskaa mukhya kaary he us sanstha ke aantarik or bahari sanchaar ko behatar bananaa
 Unlike Alan Greenspan, the Governor of the Reserve Bank cannot speak in riddles
 balki, hamaara kaam to janata ko yah samajhaana hota he ki kyon mudrasphiti ko kam karne ke liye yaa bainkon main enpie ghataane ke liye aarthik dhaanche main sudhaar kii jarurat he
 That is why, like the central banks of developed countries, we cannot speak in technical language understood by only a few people

 rajbhasha vibhaag ke paas yah kathin kaam he ki use na sirf hamaari nitiyon ke peeche kaa arthshaastra logon tak pahunchaana he, balki yah kaam aisi saral bhashaa main karnaa he ki aapako ise samajhane ke liye dabl piech
 No need to be a d - one in Economics and one in Hindi
 " At times, Governor Rajan kept laughing at the situation at times and sometimes faltering, he was able to speak very hard but he said many sentences with ease
 rajan ke bachapan ke bare main jaankaree nahin he magar kisi ne bataaya ki jivan ke behad aarambhik varsh bhopal main guzare hai
 On reaching his last legs, he smiled as if saying that i saw that i also gave a speech in Hindi
 dakshin bhartiya hindi bolta he to vaise hi man main atirikt shraddha umad aati he

 Jayaraman, the first official official of the Reserve Bank of India, was a South Indian
 tamil sanskrit or hindi ke vidwaan jayraman ko padam shri bhi mil chukaa he
 The Reserve Bank of India was celebrating the golden jubilee of the official language
 deshbhar se aae reserve bank or anya bainkon ke chah saat sau afasaron kii nigahen sirf rajan ko dekhne kaa man banaakar ain thim
 Only those who got the award and with their hands
 vijeta manch par is tarah khadey ho rahe the ki har frem main rajan aate rahen
 Rajan Sahab put forward the other sub-governors to give some prizes too, but the winners did not like it
 jinhone rajan ke haathon se liya khushi-khushi laute or jinhen nahin mila ve manch par aise udhaas dikhe jaise nilamban patr pakadaaya ja rahaa ho
 In the end, there was no winner
 up-governor se puraskaar lekar rajan ke paas tasviir khinchane chalaa gaya
 Holding his mandate in his hand, he smiled and came back, framed with his hero
 kaash main bhi mil aata! The event was to begin at 5 pm
 main 5 bajkar 3 minute par pahunchaa
 There were a few people outside the auditorium besides the welcome officer
 pahunchate hi laga ki kahin sabase pehle to nahin aa gaya
 Welcoming officer friend Anil told that all the people are inside
 governor sahab thik 5 baje aa gaye or manch par baith hue hai
 On hearing this, i felt myself why it was delayed by three minutes
 mujhe bhi deree se chidh he
 The hall was packed but the effect was such that Rajan was sitting on every seat
 yah bhi ho saktaa he ki main bhi usee kautuhal se rajan ko dekh rahaa tha, jisase baaqi dekh rahe the
 After his departure, the famous poet Ashok Chakradhar clearly said that i will not get up from the chair on which Governor Rajan was sitting
 maine kisi santhaan ke chaparasi se lekar adhikari tak main apane mukhiya ke prati aisa aakarshan nahin dekha he
 Something has happened within the Reserve Bank of India that has made Rajan truly a Rajan
 reserve bank kii garima hameshaa se rahi he, lekin rajan kaa kuch to asar hua he, jiske kaaran manzole str ke adhikariyon kaa aatmgaurav chhalak rahaa tha
 i began to hear with my ears what people talk about Rajan
 har awaz main sakaaraatmakataa thi
 In conversation, when i said that the discussion is that the next governor could be someone else, then the people around got small
 "hamaare sahab bahut achche hai"
 We sit and work in the office
 unke kaam karne se sara reserve bank kaam karata he
 The files keep running
 sabase baat bahut achche se karte hai
 They keep themselves back
 ham logon ko aage kar dete hai
 The talent is there, the men are very good
 governor sahab har chiz par nazar rakhte hai
 He worries that everyone should get two days of bread
 kisi ke saath dhokhadhadi na ho
 These are the few voices i heard from different people about Raghuram Rajan
 maine kisi se puch diya ki rajan ko hindi aati he
 i was told to take time out with a very junior officer and discuss in Hindi
 vah bhi banking vishyon par
 When he called a journalist a fiscal deficit, he felt that he had not listened wrong
 jab duusare vaktaa bol rahe the tab manch par raghuram rajan apane bhaashan kaa abhyaas kar rahe the
 The words were marked
 bhaashan kii copy vahiin mez par chhot gai
 i thought Rajan had read Hindi written in Roman, but the copy of his speech was in Devanagari
 aise padon par log hindi ke naam par chakma de jate hai
 Perhaps it is not Rajan's nature to dodge
 rajan ne kaha, "rajbhasha kaa kaam sajaavati sahitya yaa kala ko protsaahan dena nahin he
 Its main function is to improve the internal and external communication of that institution
 alan greenspan ke vipareet, reserve bank kaa governor paheliyon main baat nahin kar saktaa
 Rather, our job is to explain to the public why the economic structure needs to be improved to reduce inflation or to reduce npas in banks
 isiilie, ham viksit deshon ke kendriya bainkon kii tarah sirf kuch logon ko samaj main aane vaali takneekee bhashaa main baat nahin kar sakate
 The comments unhone kaha ki "arthshaastra vaise hi ek kathin vishay he
 The Department of Official Language has a difficult task that it not only has to convey the economics behind our policies to people, but it has to be done in such a simple language that you have to understand the double ph
 di hone kii jarurat na pade - ek arthshaastra main or ek hindi main
 " kabhi khud par to kabhi halaat par hansate hue governor rajan kabhi kabhaar ladkadhaate bhi rahe, bahut mushkil se patibaddhta bol paae lekin kai vaakyon ko sahajata se kah gaye
 There is no information about Rajan's childhood but someone told that the very early years of his life have passed in Bhopal
 aakiri pairon par pahunch kar aise muskuraae jaise kah rahe hon ki dekha maine bhi hindi main bhaashan de diya
 If the South Indian speaks Hindi, there is extra reverence in the mind
 bhartiya reserve bank ke pehle rajbhasha adhikari pi jayraman dakshin bhartiya hi the
 Jayaraman, a scholar of Tamil Sanskrit and Hindi, has also received the Padma Shri
 yah kaarykram 5 baje se shuru hona tha
 i arrived at 5:30
 sabhaagaar ke baahar swaagat adhikari ke alaava ikkaa-dukka log the
 As soon as he arrived, he felt that he had not come first
 swaagat adhikari mitra anil ne bataaya ki saare log bheetar hai
 The Governor arrived at exactly 5 o'clock and is sitting on the stage
 sunate hi khud se koft hui ki ye teen minute kii deree hui kyon
 i am also annoyed at the delay
 haul khachaakhach bharaa tha magar asar aisa ki laga har seat par rajan baithe hai
 It may also be that i too was looking at Rajan with the same curiosity as the others were watching
 unke jane ke baad prasiddh kavi ashok chakradhar ne to saaf kah diya ki main to us kursi se uthunga nahin jis par governor rajan baithe the
 i have not seen such attraction towards my head from peon to officer of any institute
 bhartiya reserve bank ke bheetar kuch to aisa gata he jisane rajan ko vaaqai rajan bana diya he
 The dignity of the Reserve Bank has always been there, but Rajan has had some effect, due to which the middle level officials were spontaneously cheating
 main kaanon se sunne laga ki log rajan ke bare main kya baat karte hai
 There was positivity in every voice
 baat-baat main jab maine kah diya ki charchaa to he ki aglaa governor koi or ho saktaa he to aasapaas ke logon kaa munh chota-sa ho gaya
