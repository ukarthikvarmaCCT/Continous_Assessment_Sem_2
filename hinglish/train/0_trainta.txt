 You will be surprised to hear how much work was done in this winter session of Lok Sabha
 is puure satr main kul 271 minute yani chaar ghante or tees minute kaam hua
 The session was scheduled to run from 5 December to 20 December but was postponed indefinitely two days in advance
 is satr main bhi pichley satr kii bhaanti hangaamaa hota rahaa or 94 fisadi samay shorgul kii bhent chadh gaya
 This time there was a lot of uproar on the issue of separate Telangana
 udhar rajya sabha main bhi kaaphi hangaamaa hua or vahaan bhi kaam baadhit hua lekin vahaan kul 19 fisadi samay kaa sadupyog hua
 It is to be noted that running the Parliament costs about two and a half lakh rupees every minute
 loksabhaa main kai mahatvapurn vidheyak the jinamein sirf 6 hi pesh ho sake
 But only one bill was passed by Lokpal
 baaki sabhi hangaame kii bhent chadh gaye
 Now they will wait for the new Lok Sabha
 sasand main kul 125 vidheyak lambit hai jinamein kai behad mahatvapurn he
 But now when they will pass, it is difficult to say
 15veen loksabhaa kaa yah aakhri satr tha or ab ise vot on acount ke liye hi bulaayaa jayega
 In the second recommendation, one state union will have one vote and others will be relegated as associate members
 iskaa matlab he ki bisisiai agm ke dauraan aisi sthiti main adhyaksh shashaank manohar matdaan nahin kar sakate hai, kyonki maharashtra kaa hi manyata praapt voter hoga
 Vidarbha and Mumbai will be relegated as Associate Members
 isi tarah se niranjan shah matdaan nahin kar paaenge, kyonki saurashtra associat sadsy ban jayega or gujarat mukhya sadsy
 In this way, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Telangana will also get voting rights due to being an independent state
 rashtriya cricket club (ensisi) apana matdaan kaa adhikaar ganvaa degaa
 Similarly Niranjan Shah will not be able to vote, as Saurashtra will become Associate Member and Gujarat Chief Member
 is tarah se bihar, chhattisgarh or telugana ko bhi swatantra rajya hone ke kaaran matdaan kaa adhikaar mil jayega
 The National Cricket Club (NCC) will lose its voting rights

 raaje ne 2013 main rajasthan ke vidhansabha chunaav se purv 'suraaj sankalp yatra' kii shuruuaat rajsamand ke charbhuja mandir se kii thi
 (from input language) saini ne kaha ki kendra or rajya sarkaar kii janakalyankari yojanaon ko samaaj ke antim vyakti tak lekar jane ke liye agast main yatra kaa aayojan kiya jaayegaa
 Raje started the 'suraj Sankalp Yatra' at the Charbhuja Temple in Rajsamand before the Rajasthan assembly elections in 2013
 (input bhashaa se) a woman standing in line for four hours suddenly fell unconscious outside the Rajasthan Marudhara Gramin Bank
 jisase uske pet main pal rahe paanch maah ke bachche kii maut ho gai
 In the hospital, the doctor had asked to do sonography, so for three days, the pregnant woman was traveling to the bank to withdraw money, but to get Rs
 2 thousand from the bank, this pregnant woman of Ghannerao village got queued up
 mahila ke girane ke baad bank ke baahar maujuud mahilaon ne use sambhala or use tatkaal desuri ke sarkari aspataal main le jaaya gaya
 From where he was referred to Sadi and then to Bali
 bank ke baahar hi maujuud ghanerao nivasee shyaam shrimali ne bataaya ki sukhi valaram hiragar paanch maheene kigarbhavateethi
 She stood in line at around 10 am on Thursday when she needed money for treatment
 kareeb chaar ghante tak vah anya mahilaon ke saath line main khadi rahi
 Then suddenly her health deteriorated and she fell on her stomach due to dizziness
 mahila ke sharir se khun nikalne laga to vahaan maujuud mahilaon ne gheraabandi kar mahila ko sambhala
 It is said that in this incident, a five-month-old fetus in the womb of a woman has died
 haalanki bali aspataal menmahilaka ilaaj chal rahaa he
 Arriving on the spot, the husband expressed grief that she had not come by telling, i would have got in line myself
 logon ne kiya hangaamagarbhvatee mahila kaa pati valaram hiragar lite decoration ke kaam main mazdooree karata he
 She has a 3-year-old and a 5-year-old girl
 mahila ke saath hui is ghatana ke baad vahaan maujuud logon ne jamkar hangaamaa kiya
 People allege that due to the collusion and nexus of the bank manager, influential people are being given the first money, while the needy have to stand in line for hours
 paise ke bajaay mila dardamahila ke parijanon ne bataaya ki sonography ke liye rupee kii sakht jarurat thi
 On Monday, she went to the bank, where she stood in line for about three to four hours but did not receive any money
 tisare din vah is ummid ke saath bank gai ki aaj to rupee mil hi jaaenge
 Did not get the money, on the contrary he had to go through this accident
 gramin ilaakon main bainkon se rupee nikaalane ke liye ek maheene baad bhi line kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 There is no arrangement from the bank workers regarding these queues
 mahilaon se lekar bujurg, biimaar or garbhvatee mahila tak sabhi ek line main khadey hai
 For these, there should be line from side to side
 rajasthan marudhara gramin bank kaa kahana he ki bank ke baahar kii line ke bare main unhen koi jaankaree nahin mili
 There is shortage of money in the bank due to which there is shortage

 The way onion prices are increasing, it seems that in today's time, onion has become more valuable to the thieves than rupees

 sutron ne yah jaankaree di
 Earlier, the Supreme Court, while giving the verdict, supported the construction of Ram temple through a trust at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed to give five acres of land at an alternative location to build a mosque in the city itself
 sutron ne bataaya ki faisle ke baad mantralay ke varisht adhikariyon ne vibhinn deshon or sahyogi deshon ke rajanyikon ko isse avgat karaayaa

 Long-retired paramilitary forces have been demanding implementation of the old pension scheme
 ye ardhsainik bal ab apni maang ko manwaane ke liye aagaamee 3 march ko dilli ke jantar-mantar par jute rahe hai
 There is a demand of these retired soldiers coming from different parts of the country that the government should replace the existing pension scheme NPS and implement the old pension scheme
 lekin sawaal he ki aakhir kyon nai pension yojana khatm karne kii maang ho rahi he
 What a shock to the pocket of paramilitary forces from this plan
 aaj ham is report main isaki jaankaree denge
 If you talk about the old pension scheme and the old NPS pension scheme, then under the old pension scheme, the army and paramilitary forces used to get a kind of pension
 puraani skim main pension kaa nirdhaaran sarkari karmchaaree kii aakhri basic selary or mahangaai dar ke aankadon ke anusaar hota he
 But the new pension scheme (NPS), which came into force from the year 2004, is determined according to the total deposit amount and the return on investment
 haalanki NPS ke tahat kuch aisi suvidhaayen mil rahi hai jo puraani skim main nahin thi
 For example, the government's contribution to the NPS would be 14 per cent of the basic salary of the employees
 vahiin is skim ke tahat jamaa hone vaali raashi par tex chhot ko inakam tex kii dhara 80C ke daayre main laayaa gaya he
 This facility was not in the old pension scheme
 puraani skim maang kii vajahadrasal, ardhsainik bal puraani pension skim bahaali kii maang mukhyataur par isliye kar rahe hai kyonki isamen karmchaariyon kaa koi countribution nahin he or tay pension kii guarantee bhi he
 Whereas the returns in the new pension scheme are not local
 matlab yah he nai skim main ritern acha nahin milane par pension paane vaale logon ko nuksaan bhi ho saktaa he
 While there are good returns, new employees can also get good amount of money at the time of retirement as compared to the old scheme of provident fund and pension
 lekin ritred ardhsainik bal risk game se bachanaa chaahate hai
 Explain that the government launched the National Pension Scheme for government employees in January 2004
 iske aane ke baad se jitne bhi sarkari karmchaariyon kii niyukti hui, ve puraani pension skim kii bajaay enpies ke tahat aane lage
 How is the use of NPS Under the NPS, any government employee can invest in a pension account during his tenure
 vahiin ritair hone par khatadharak apni ek mushth rakam main se 75 fisadi hissaa nikaal saktaa he
 At the same time, one can buy an annual plan from the rest of the money, in which regular income can be arranged for the month

 aisa aksar hota he ki agar kisi cheez ko har roj kiya jaae to log dhire-dhire us par gaur karnaa band kar dete hai
 In the matter of increasing the prices of petrol, the central government has adopted this strategy and it seems that its strategy has been really successful
 ek samay tha ki petrol kii keemton main 50 paise yaa ₹1 kii badhotaree par bhi hangaamaa khadaa ho jaataa tha or puraa vipaksh aasmaan sir par uthaa letaa tha, lekin aap bhi yah soch kar hairaan ho jaaenge ki pichley 2 maheenon main petrol kii keemten 5 rupye 42 paise prati litre bad chuki he or kisi ne gaur tak nahin kiya
 The reason for this is that from 16 June the government implemented "dynamic Fuel Pricing" in the case of oil prices across the country
 sidhe shabdon main iskaa matlab yah he ki tel kii keemten 16 june ke baad se har roj kachche tel ke daam ke hisaab se badhati yaa ghatati hai
 Earlier, after every 15 days, the price of oil was changed based on the price of crude oil
 tel kii keemten tay karne ke bare main 16 june ke badlaav ke baad pehle kuch dinon tak to graahak phaayde main rahe
 Slowly 3 in the price of petrol for the first 13 days
 45 rupee paise kii kami hui
 At the same time, the price of ceptrol started increasing such that between 28 June and 24 August the price of petrol in Delhi was ₹ 5
 42 paise bad chuki he
 Since June 28, the price of petrol has reduced between two and a half paise but now it is 68 in Delhi
 88 rupe prati litre tak pahunch chuki he
 Similarly, when it comes to the price of diesel, between July 1 and August 24, the price of diesel has increased by 3 rupees 72 paise per liter
 24 agast ko dilli main dijal kii keemat prati litre 57
 06 paisa per liter has been reached
 aakhir keemtee main lagaataar badhotaree kii vajah kya he ise lekar sabhi asamanjas main hai
 Obviously, the biggest reason for this is the price of crude oil in the international market
 27 june kiantarrashtriya bazarmen kachche tel kii keemat 45
 42 dollars per barrel
 jo ki 23 agast ko badhkar 50
 Has reached $ 51 a barrel
 haalanki petrol kii keemton main badhottaree kaa ekmaatr kaaran kachche tel kii keemten nahin he
 Central and state governments levy a similar type of tax before reaching the customer
 vah keemton main badhottaree kii vajah banati he
 As you would know, despite the implementation of GST, oil is kept out of its purview
 aisa isliye he kyonki centre or rajya sarkaar donon kii aamadani kaa ek bada hissaa tel par lagaae gaye tex se aata he
 If you have ever gone to watch a cricket match and have bought something to eat inside the stadium, then you must remember that there is often a ruckus
 jo pani kii bottle stadium ke thik baahar 20 rupye kii milti he usee ke liye stadium ke bheetar kai baar doguni keemat adaa kerani padati he
 But now this will not happen
 upabhokta maamalon ke mantri ramvilas paswaanne bataaya ki bisisiai is baat ke liye taiyaar ho gaya he ki ab stadium ke bheetar pine ke pani kii bottle usee keemat par milegi jis keemat par stadium ke baahar milti he
 That is, there will no longer be different prices for the same water bottle outside and inside the stadium
 iske alaava equafina ke naam se pine ke pani kii bottle banane vaali company pepsy ne mantralay ko ye bataaya he ki ab deshbhar main har jagah pine ke pani kii bottle ek hi kii keemat par bechegi
 The consumer ministry has been campaigning for a long time that different mrps cannot be held at different places for the same thing
 ise sakhti se lagu kiye jane ke bare main puche jane par ramvilas paswan ne mana ki abhi bhi aisa ho rahaa he lekin unhone kaha ki jahaan se shikaayatein aati hai vahaan karrwai kii ja rahi he
 Another good news for consumers
 agar aap tamaam restaurant main jabardastee bill main jode gaye sarvice charge se pareshaan hai to sarkaar iske liye bhi kadam uthaane ja rahi he
 Hotel and restaurant owners argue about the service charge as a tip in advance that is distributed among hotel staff
 upabhokta maamalon ke mantri ramvilas paswan ne saaf kaha ki is tarah se jabardastee sarvice charge vasula janaa galat he
 Tip giving or not should be at the customer's will
 iske liye sarkaar ne disha-nirdesh taiyaar kiya he, jise manjuuri ke liye pradhanmantri karyaalay ko bheja gaya he
 It is already in discussion that the government can ask the hotels to serve the customers according to the need, to prevent wastage of food
 sarkaar khaane kii barbaadi rokna chaahati he lekin hotel or restaurant ke maalik ise apane kaamkaaj main dakhal maan rahe hai
 On Friday, Ram Vilas Paswan met the hotel association about this
 sarkaar ne ye baat saaf kii ki uskaa iraadaa keemton main hastkshep karne kaa nahin he
 However, the customer should be able to ask for as much food as he needs
 vittamantri pranab mukherjee ne chintaa jataai ki pashchim asia main jari raajnneetik sankat se badhati tel keemton kaa gambhir nitigat asar hoga, lekin unhone saath hi vishwaas jataayaa ki halaat se nipat liya jayega
 India has to import two-thirds of its crude oil from abroad
 aise main isaki keemton main oochaal sarkaar ke liye buree khabar hi mana jayega, kyonki use sthiti se nipatane ke liye sabsidi par adhik kharch badhaane yaa upabhoktaaon par daam kaa boj badhaane kaa alokapriy nirnay karne jaise do kathin vikalpon kii bich chunaav karnaa hoga
 Mukherjee told reporters after the Reserve Bank board meeting, "the slow recovery in the world economy, the uncertainty arising out of political upsurge in West Asia and North Africa can pose serious challenges for Indian policy makers
" ullekhneey he ki antarrashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemten 116 dollar prati bairal kii oonchai ko chhu gai hai
 The Finance Ministry has estimated the expenditure on the oil subsidy head to be Rs 23,640 crore in 2011-12, while in the current financial year a provision of Rs 38,386 crore has been made on this head
 kachche tel kii keemten badhati raheen, to sarkaar ko sabsidi par or adhik dhan kharch karnaa hoga
 India's oil imports 7 in January
 8 pratishat badhkar 7
 85 billion dollars, bringing the import bill to 79 in april-january 2010-11
 95 arab dollar rahaa
 Mukherjee said, i would like to assure you that in consultation with the Reserve Bank, we will face this challenge
 
 
 yah mujhe vishwaas he
 Regarding the world economy, he said that the economy of developed countries like America is improving but governments of some euro area countries like Ireland, Spain and Portugal have money crisis to repay the debt
 mukherjee ne kaha ki dekhnaa yah he ki in deshon ke rin sankat kaa europe ke anya deshon par kaisaa asar padataa he
 Mukherjee said that rapid economic growth of Europe is necessary for India itself

 The Supreme Court is going to give its final verdict on the imperative of Aadhaar in a few days from now
 lekin isse pehle duniya ke sabase bade biometric database ko sanchalit kar rahi sanstha unic identification athurity of india (UIDAI) ne aadhaar number pranali kii suraksha ko sunishchit karne ke liye facial rikgnishan ko anivaary karne kaa faisla liya he
 By making facial recognition mandatory, the services for which Aadhaar is mandatory, such as banking, mobile operators and government schemes, for the benefit of Aadhaar authentication will now have to get facial recognition done
 haalanki abhi tak UIDAI ke paas maujuud aadhaar data main kisi naagarik kaa facial rikgnishan data maujuud nahin he
 According to UIDAI, along with providing the photo while doing KYC, on-spot photo will also be taken for Aadhaar authentication
 yuidiai ne daawa kiya he ki facial rikgnishan se maujuuda othentication prakriya ko or durust kiya ja sakegaa
 At present, the process of iris authentication and fingerprints (fingerprint authentication) for Aadhaar authentication and otpauthentication is done through mobile phones
 gauratlab he ki is prakriya ko yuidiai dwaara 17 agast,2018 ko jari kiye gaye circular ke aadhaar par kiya ja rahaa he
 According to UIDAI, this will make the Aadhaar program more inclusive
 is kadam se un logon kaa aadhaar othentification aasaan ho jayega jinhenfingerprintke jariye aadhaar veriphication main dikkat kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 Significantly, along with the elderly population in the country, most of the laborers face difficulties in getting authentication through fingerprint
 UIDAI ne kaha he ki is nai technology ke istemaal ko dhire-dhire vyavastha main shaamil kiya jayega
 Therefore, through this order, UIDAI is now expected to collect facial recognition data of citizens in the country so that it can be used
 ise padhein: nai naukari dene main china 100 fisadi or modi sarkaar 1 fisadi bhi nahin: rahul gandhicendre sarkaar ke mutabik desh main sabhi telecom sarvice prowiders ko nirdesh jari kar diya gaya he ki vah facial rikgnishan technology kaa istemaal jald se jald aadhaar veriphication ke liye shuru kar den
 Telecom providers have also been given an ultimatum that they should get at least 10% of their total monthly transactions by September 15, 2018 through Authentication Facial Recognition otherwise they will be charged a minimum charge per transaction
 circular ke jariye yah bhi chetavanee di gai he ki is niyam kaa paalan na karnaa aadhaar act 2016 ke tahat aparaadh he or iske tahat doshi paae jane par jail or jurmaane athwa donon kii sajaa di jaaegi
 In such a situation, the question arises that to implement this Facial Recognition System for the elderly population and labor class at present, UIDAI will have to queue once again to take a sample of all citizens
 The Because unless UIDAI does not have this sample, how will it effect the authentication work through facial recognition

 The issue arose during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with a delegation of French mps
 is pratinidhimandal kaa netritv neshnal essembly ke adhyaksh cloud batolon kar rahe the
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said, "A member of the French delegation described Lakhvi's release in Pakistan as unhappy and said it was not good for both India or the world
" ' unhone kaha, 'is mudde par france bharat ke saath ekajutata vyakt karata he
 'lashkar-e-taiba operations commander Lakhvi was released from Pakistan jail today after nearly six years of arrest
 akbaruddinane bataaya ki pratinidhimandal se aatankwaad virdohi mudde par sahyog ke bare main charchaa ke dauraan lakhvi kaa maamla uthaa
 Reacting to the French opinion about this, Modi told the delegation, 'the concern you have expressed for India and the anguish you have expressed reflects our shared views
 ' pradhanmantri ne kaha ki aatankwaad ko lekar bharat or france kaa saajha drushtikon he
 He said that whenever France faced a terrorist attack, the whole of India stood up against it, and the same sentiment remained in France when something like this happened against India
 lashkare taiyaba ke commander or 2008 ke mumbai hamale ke mastermind jackieur rahamaan lakhvi ko kareeb chah saal hiraasat main gujaarne ke baad aaj reeha kar diya gaya
 Lakhvi was released from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi after the Lahore High Court (LHC) suspended Lakhvi's custody and ordered his immediate release
 bharat ne adaalat ke faisle par kadi pratikriya karte hue kaha tha ki isse seemaa paar aatankwaad par pakistan dwaara baar baar die gaye bharose kii keemat khatm hoti he
 Jamaat-ud Dawa's supporters stood outside the prison to receive Lakhvi, 55 years old
 adaalat ne ek suraksha adhinium ke tahat lakhvi ko hiraasat main lene ke punjab sarkaar ke aadesh ko kal nilambit karte hue uski tatkaal rihaai kaa aadesh diya tha
 Earlier today, Lakhvi's lawyer Raja Rizwan Abbasi told PTI that the government had no other legal option than to release his client
 abbasi ne kaha, 'alechasi dwaara mere muvakkil kii hiraasat ko khaarij kiye jane ke baad ab sarkaar ke paas use reeha karne ke alaava koi anya kanoonee vikalp nahin bachaa he
 Neither the government nor the Adiala Jail Administration can violate the court order at this time
 ' lakhvi or chah anya par 2008 ke mumbai hamale kii yojana banane or use anjaam dene kaa maamla darj he
 166 people were killed and over 300 injured in this attack
 lashkare taiyaba ke sansthaapak or jamaat ud daawa ke pramukh hafiz said ke kareebi rishtedaar lakhvi ko disambar 2008 main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 After the release of Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the main accused in the Mumbai attack on Friday, a leading Pakistani newspaper has pulled Islamabad for its failure to prove the crime of this dreaded terrorist
 lahore ucch nyaayalay dwaara guuruuvaar ko lakhvi ko reeha karne kaa aadesh dene ke baad shuukravaar ko apane sampadakeey main samachaarpatr nesan ne kaha, 'lakhvi par mukadmaa chalaane main pakistan ek baar phir vifal rahaa he
 Not only failed, it seems that this time he did not even try his best
 'akhbaar ne kaha he, 'ek taraf jab desh aatankwaad se lard rahaa he, aise main lakhvi ko doshi qaraar dene se aatankwaad ke khilaaf desh ke liye ek badi uplabdhi hoti
 According to the editorial, the release of Lakhvi, who was held responsible for the murder of 166 Indian and foreign nationals in November 2008, has proved to be a hollow speech given by Pakistan's leaders against terror
 akhbaar ne kaha he,'paakhand itnaa spasht he ki yah janata kii soch ko sharminda karata he
 "according to the article," the hearing was postponed for several years because neither the judge nor the witness nor the accused could appear in the court in view of security concerns
 ' nesan ne jail main lakhvi ke thaath-baat kii ore ishaara kiya
 He had many facilities including television, internet
 vah bina kisi kii anumati ke manachaahi sankhya main mulakatiyon se mil saktaa tha
 The newspaper has said, "if the government cannot get on the right track even after the death of 132 children, then it is difficult to say what will happen next
" ' Hartalika Teej is the day when Suhag is worshiped for a long life
 nirjal vrath rakh maangi jaati he suhaag kii lambii umr kii kaamana or maanga jaataa he sukh samruddhi kaa aashirwad
 On the occasion of Teej, you will be engaged in the preparations for worshiping from early morning, but before that, know the correct method of worship of Shiva Gauri and the story of this fast
 ek baar shuru kiya vrath karnaa hoga taumrais vrath kii paatr kumari kanyaayein yaa suhaagin mahilaayein donon hi hai
 But once you keep this fast, then this fast has to be kept throughout the life
 yadi vrati mahila gambhir rogi halaat main ho to uske badale main duusari mahila yaa uskaa pati bhi is vrath ko rakh sakane kaa vidhaan he
 How to do Harlatika Teej Vrat: On this fast, the fortunate women wear sixteen new red clothes, apply henna, make sixteen adornments and start worshiping Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati Ji in auspicious time
 is puja main shiv-parvati kii murtiyon kaa vidhivat pujan kiya jaataa he or phiraharatalika tijki katha ko suna jaataa he
 All the items of suhag are offered on Mata Parvati
 bhakton main manyata he ki jo sabhi paapon or sansaarik tapon ko harne walehartalika vrath ko vidhipurvak karata he, uske saubhaahgya kii raksha swayan bhagwaan shiv karte hai
 Fasting of this fast is prohibited for sleeping on this fast, for this, she has to do night awakening with bhajan kirtan in the night, after taking a bath in the morning, in reverence and devotion to a well-loved Suhagin woman, make up, clothes, food items, fruits, Donation of sweets and as much Shakti jewelery should be done
 kyon padhaaharatalika tijnamahartalikado shabdon se bana he, harith or talika
 Green means haran and table means sakhi
 yah parv bhadrapada kii shukla tritiya ko manaaya jaataa he, jis kaaran ise teej kehete he
 This fast is called Haritalika because Parvati's friend (friend) took her away from her father's house and took her into the forest
 haratalika teej vrath kathaling puraana kii ek katha ke anusaar maa parvati ne apane purv janm main bhagwaan shankar ko pati rup main praapt karne ke liye himalay par ganga ke tat par apni baalyavastha main adhomukhi hokar ghor tap kiya
 During this time he did not consume food
 kai varshon tak unhone keval hawa pikar hi vyateet kiya
 His father was extremely sad to see this situation of Mother Parvati
 isi dauraan ek din maharishi naarad bhagwaan vishnu kii ore se parvati ji ke vivaah kaa prastaav lekar maa parvati ke pita ke paas pahunche, jise unhone saharsha hi sweekaar kar liya
 When the father told her marriage to mother Parvati, she became very sad and started mourning loudly
 phir ek sakhi ke poochne par mata ne use bataaya ki vah yah kathor vrath bhagwaan shiv ko pati rup main praapt karne ke liye kar rahi hai jabaki unke pita unka vivaah vishnu se karana chaahate hai
 Then on the advice of Saheli, Mata Parvati went into the dense forest and went to a cave and got absorbed in the worship of Lord Shiva
 bhadrapada tritiya shukla ke din hast nakshatra ko mata parvati ne ret se shivlinga kaa nirmaan kiya or bholenath kii stuti main leen hokar raatri jaagran kiya
 Pleased with this harsh austerity of Mother, Lord Shiva appeared to her and accepted her as his wife at will
 manyata he ki is din jo mahilaayein vidhi-vidhanpurvak or purna nishtha se is vrath ko karti hai, vah apane man ke anuroop pati ko praapt karti hai
 Also, this festival is also celebrated with the aim of maintaining happiness in married life
 uttar bharat ke kai rajyon main is din mehandi lagane or jhula-jhulane kii pratha he

 At this time, when the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is trying its best to cut every attempt to form the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Delhi, it is facing a new crisis within itself
 
 aam aadmi party ke hi rohinee vidhansabha kshetra ke vidhayak rajesh garg ne party pramukh arvind kejariwal par bhrasht logon ko badhaava dene tathaa party kaaryakartaaon ke dukh-dard ko nahin samajhane ke aarope lagaate hue unhen chitthee likhi he
 Rajesh Garg has also suggested in the letter that Arvind Kejriwal should have got a public opinion before seeking to dissolve the Delhi Assembly
 'aap' vidhayak rajesh garg dwaara party pramukh arvind kejariwal ko likhaa khulaa patr is prakaar he
 
 
 Respected Arvind Kejriwal, Vande Mataram! You accept the truth and stop promoting the money and corrupt people in the party
 aam aadmi party ke saadhaaran kaaryakarta ke dukh-dard ko bhi samajhane kaa prayaas karen, jo vastav me bhrashtachar ke khilaaf apana sab kuch nyochaavar karne ke liye aayaa tha, lekin na jane kyon, aap or ashutosh ji bhaajapa ke sansad sadsy va punjab kesari akhbaar ke sampadak ashvini kumaar chopra ke arabon rupee ke jameen ghotaalon ke bare main chup hai? When you repeatedly demand to dissolve the Assembly in Delhi, what has passed on the workers, the public and the mlas of all the elected parties, have you ever thought? Under Swaraj policy, if you had an election in Delhi or not - if you had a public opinion before taking any decision, then the voters would have got a better message
 
 
 baaki aapaki marzi
 
 
 i live among the people at all times, and it was my duty to make you aware of the public sentiment, which i have completed by daring
 yadi yahi himmat 14 farvari, 2014 ko vidhansabha satr ke dauraan kar lee hoti to aaj ham dilli kii janata kii seva kar rahe hote, kyonki sarkaar na hone kii vajah se kuch bhi nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Government should be formed in Delhi, irrespective of anyone
 ham deshbhakt ke rup main eemaandaaree se seva karne aae the, na ki satta ke liye raajnneeti karne aae the! aaj hamen dilli kii janata ko chunaav kii sthiti se baahar nikaalkar 1,000 karod rupee ke aarthik boj se bachaane ke bare main sochna chahie, na ki baar-baar chunaav karaane kii jidd par adane se
 
 
 Can't we do a good job sitting in opposition? One thing needs to be noted that if any party does not get a clear majority even after re-election, then how will we respond to the public
 
 
 yah bhi sochane kaa vishay he
 
 
 The rest is your wish
 
 
 sadaiv aapke saath, rajesh garg / aap rohinee Now a lot of meaning can be derived from this open letter, because after this, while questions are being raised on Arvind Kejriwal, the question is bound to arise on this AAP MLA too
 aravind kejariwal par sawaal ye ki kya wo ab bhi kahenge ki unke sabhi vidhayak dilli vidhansabha bhang karakar chunaav chaahate hai? The question on the AAP MLA is that Rohini seat, traditionally considered a BJP seat, was won by AAP MLA Rajesh Garg in 2013, does he not want the election for fear of losing the election and talking against the party line Have been? jaise hi ye maamla uchhla tabhi se aap vidhayak rajesh garg media kii pahunch se dur ho gaye isliye keval is baat kii hi pushti unase phone par ho pai ki khat unhone hi likhaa he
 While the party has said that they have not received any letter so far, only after talking to the MLA will they be able to give any feedback on it and the issues raised in it
 kejariwal ko jis tarah kii chitthee unke vidhayak ne likh daali he is par party ke paas fajihat se bachane ke liye isse badhiya koi jawaab naa tha
 In the end, i would like to say only one thing, "beware of your dear ones, i will deal with the people", this fits perfectly on the Aam Aadmi Party
 apane do saal ke jeevankaal main party ko uske dushmano ne utana pareshaan yaa nuksaan nahin kiya jitna uske apano ne kiya
 Be it your mlas, leaders or Arvind Kejriwal himself

 This picture taken by him became a symbol of the Bhopal gas tragedy in the world in which more than 15,000 people were killed and millions were crippled

 Bathurlomev, who received the 'world Press Photo of the Year' award for the year 1984, said, "the current situation raises a lot of questions about the country and its condition which are frightening

 Baba Ram Rahim
 naam to suna hi hoga
 You will be well aware of the face and if you are aware then why not
 kyonki baba hero bhi to hai
 But now there is a ruckus on Baba
 kyon, kaise, or kahaan, isaki puri haqiqat ham aapako bataa rahe hai
 From Punjab to Haryana, women, young people, elderly people have left the streets for Baba Ram Rahim and have come to the streets
 police kii naak main dam ho gaya, kisi ko samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki ye ho kya rahaa he
 The court's verdict is coming on August 25 in the rape case against Sadhvi against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 panchkula sibiai court ko baba par faisla sunaanaa he, lekin taarikh aane se pehle hi panchkula kile main tabdeel ho chukaa he
 The entire platoon of police and para military force platoon has been deployed
 ram rahim ke samarthak kah rahe hai ki wo apane baba kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin hone denge
 Not only in Panchkula, supporters of Dera Sacha Sauda from Fatehabad in Haryana to Panipat, Sangrur have left their homes for Baba
 koi naare baazi kar rahaa he, to koi dhamkiyaan de rahaa he, kisi ke haath main danda hai
 Threats of the devotees- If the verdict came against Baba, it would be bad for Anjambaba Ram Rahim since 2007
 haryana main sirsa ke bahari ilaake main deraa kaa shivi he
 Panchkula CBI court will give verdict on 25 August
 lekin faisle se pehle baba ke samarthakon ne dhamkee di he
 If the verdict goes against Baba, the consequences will be bad
 kaha ja rahaa he ki baba ke samarthakon ne deazal, petrol or pathar bhi juta liye hai
 Five crore devotees, from the United States to Australia, the Samanthadera Sacha Sauda Ashram has been in operation for almost 68 years
 kaha jaataa he ki deraa sachcha sauda kaa samrajya desh se lekar videsh tak failaa he
 It has ashrams and followers in the United States, Canada, England, Australia and even to the United States
 daawa to yahaan tak kiya jaataa he ki duniyabar main dere ke kareeb paanch karod anuyaayi hai
 Of which about 25 lakh followers are in Haryana alone

 15 agast ko manaate hai berthde, lagjri gadiyon kaa kafilababa ram rahim ne pandrah agast ko apana 50 waan janmdin manaaya
 They walk in a convoy of luxury vehicles
 kahin ruke to gadiyon ko dhank diya jaataa he
 It is not even known in which train Baba is sitting
 suraksha main angrakshak bhi mustaid najar aate hai
 Baba is fond of films
 
 
 baba ko filmon kaa bhi shauk he
 One, not two
 
 Rather, he has acted as a lead actor in five films
 ems se lekar jattu ejeeniyar tak unki filmein kaamyaab bhi rahi hai
 The Dera chief, who was made at the age of 23, tell you that Baba Ram Rahim, born in 1967 in Jat Sikh family in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan, was declared his heir on 23 September 1990 by the then Dera chief Satnam Singh
 phir baba ram rahim kii aguwai main dere kii lokapriyata badhane lagi
 Baba Ram Rahim's Dera Sacha Sauda gives the message of increasing social harmony, from de-addiction and human service to all religion
 lihaaja, inke anukaayiyon kii taadaad bhi badhati ja rahi he
 Such is the list of disputes related to Dera and Baba Ram Rahim
 
 
 saal 2001 - sadhvi ke saath yon shoshan kaa maamlasaal 2002 - patrkaar ramchandra kii hatya kaa aropasaal 2003 - deraa kii prabandhan samiti ke sadsy ranjit singh hatyakandsal 2007 - guru gobind singh ke libaas par sikhon se vivadasaal 2010 - deraa ke purv manager fakir chand kii gumshudagi kii maamlasaal 2012 - dere ke 400 saadhuon ko napunsak banane kaa aarope In the Lok Sabha elections, the people of the country expressed their trust in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his development work, due to which the BJP crossed the figure of 300 seats for the first time
 loksabhaa ke baad hue maharashtra or haryana ke chunaavon main bijepi ko aasaani se apni jeet kaa bharosa tha, kyonki 4 maheene pehle hi hue chunaavon main bijepi ne prachad jeet hasil kii thi, lekin vidhansabha chunaavon ke aaen parinaamon ne bhaajapa netritv ko sochane par majaboor kar diya, kyonki in chunaavon main naa to vikaas kii baat par janata ne vot diya or naa hi dhara 370 ke naam par vot mila
 The new problem for the BJP is now that its allies are constantly abandoning it, in Maharashtra, where the Shiv Sena broke the 33-year-old alliance, the bjp's 20-year-old partner in Jharkhand, AJSU, took the seat just before the elections
 The alliance broke up over partition
 to sawaal yah hai ki kaise ek baar phir bhaajapa is adivasee pradesh main gaiyr adivasee mukhyamantri ko kursi par baitha paaengi?jharkhand main 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main congress or jeemem donon ne alag-alag chunaav ladaa tha, lekin is baar donon partiyaan saath main lard rahi he, vahiin,pichley chunaavon main bijepi ne aajus or algepi ke saath milakar chunaav ladaa tha, lekin is baar party kaa gathbandhan tut gaya he
 The same JVM which contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections along with the Congress and the JMM is contesting all the assembly seats for the first time alone

 Backward in terms of literacy, the government paid special attention to education in this state
 pradesh main beats, enaiti, indian skool of mins, im jaise prasiddh sansthaaen he
 At the same time, if we talk about the works of the Chief Minister, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah have praised him many times
 varisht netaaon ke sahyog ke kaaran hi bina kisi raajnneeti parivaar se aaen raghuvar das apane aap ko rajya kii raajnneeti main sthapit kar rahe he
 Now, if we talk about the results of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won 11 out of the total 14 seats, the same seat was won by its allies AJSU, Congress and JMM
 agar loksabhaa chunaavon ko vidhansabha parinaamon ke hisaab se dekhe to yahaan bijepi or ajasu puure pradesh main congress gathbandhan kaa supada saaf karti hui dikhaai de rahi he
 But the thing to note here is that according to the assembly results of the Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra and Haryana, the Congress alliance was getting 28 seats (56 seats) and 90 seats (10 seats), but in the assembly elections The result of this is in front of us all
 isliye vishleshan karte samay hamen yah dhyaan rakhana hoga ki, loksabhaa chunaav ke nateejein vidhansabha chunaavon main bhi vaise hi sahi sabit ho aisa jaruri nahin he,kyonki donon chunaavon main janata netaaon or muddon ko alag-alag parakhti he
 BJP + AJSUKANGES + JMM + RJD 6318 pradesh ke chunaavon kii tarikhon kaa elaan ho chukaa he
 This time the people will elect their representatives in 5 phases, but this time the political battle is also very important for Hemant Soren, because this time assembly elections are being contested by Congress and opposition parties under his leadership
 isliye yah bahut mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki vah apane aap ko pradesh kii raajnneeti main sthapit kar sake

 Rating: 4 Stardirector: Lina Yadav Artist: Radhika Apte, Surveen Chawla, Tannishtha Chatterjee and Adil Hussain Bollywood have probably forgotten one thing, the villages are still alive
 vahaan bhi log rahete hai
 There are also women
 unki bhi jidangi he or ity revolution ke daur main bhi unki samasyaayein kuch waisi hi hai jaisi kuch dashak pehle thim
 Mobile has arrived in the village, Dish's desire has gone home
 lekin auraton ke liye kuch nahin badla he
 That is society
 vahi purushavaadi najariya he
 Leena Yadav's 'parched' takes us into the same world that modern cinema has stopped showing
 jahaan auraten apane dhang se pratikaar karti hai, masti karti hai or unamem apane dhang se jivan jeene kii hasarat kuta-kootakar bhari hui he
 This story is about Rani (tannishta), Lajjo (radhika) and Bijli (surveen)
 rani vidhwaa he, or use apane jawaab bete kii shaadi kerani he
 Rani is a widow and has a son
 jisaki shaadi vah aisi ladki se kar detii he jo uski kasuti par khubasurat nahin he
 Lajjo's husband considers her infertile and feels that the only deficiency can be in the woman
 udhar, bijli ek naachne vaali he or jismfaroshi se jivan chalaati he
 Due to his tantrums and waning age, his boss brings him a replacement
 film main inhen teen auraton kii kahani he
 There is also a mobile lover, even a man who tries to bring the lives of women on track
 kahani main har vah pahalu he jo ek achche cinema main hona chahie
 Particularly, all three women are victims of circumstances, but when all three are together, they do not let any moment of fun pass through their hands
 yahi nahin, vah baap-bete kii gaali bhi ijad kar leti hai
 Such things are also the beauty of this film

 The characterization of the three characters is desiiness

 He has shown that if the role is written strongly then no artist is big or small
 tanishta chatarji ko to jaise jaandaar role karne kii aadat hi pad chuki he
 Radhika Apte is also amazing, and her rustic dialogue delivery is really amazing
 lekin sab parasurveen baari padi hai
 The film does not seem to give any lecture and runs like a pure entertaining film
 auraton kaa aapas kaa hansi-thattha film ke conection ko or majboot karata he
 When Hindi cinema is facing a drought in terms of strong stories, it is a drop of hope in those times

 modi sarkaar main kendriya peyajal or swatchta mantralay kii jimmedaari sambhaal raheen uma bharti ne ram mandir se lekar ganga mantralay waapas liye jane tak sabhi muddon par apni baat rakhi
 During this time, BJP leader Uma Bharti rejected the talk of snatching the Ganga ministry
 kendriya mantri ne kaha ki unhone khud is mantralay ko waapas lene kii bijepi adhyaksh amit shah se guzarish kii thi
 When he was asked whether you are sorry to take back the Ganga ministry? To this, Uma Bharti said, "I messaged Amit Shah from Kedarnath in October 2016 that i will no longer be the minister of Ganga
" pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ganga mantralay apane haath main lenaa hoga
 The PMO will have to take over the Ganga ministry
 sab ho gaya he ab inmplimentation kaa time aayaa he
 In such a situation, Prime Minister Modi should take it in his hand and do it
 ''bijepi netaa uma bharatine kaha ki jab baat pradhanmantri tak pahunch gai, to unhone kaha ki uma bahan abhi bani raho
 Let's see how to do it? Then the Ganga ministry went to Nitin Gadkari, he gives me the credit for everything
 ’’darasal, haal hi main kendriya mantri nitin gadakari ne ganga safai ko lekar uma bharti kii tarif kii thi
 He had said that Uma Bharti did a very good job of cleaning the Ganges
 uma bharti ne kai aise kaam shuru kiye hai, jinka nateeja bahut jald hi saamne aayega
 He had said that Uma Bharatisara has cooked the food and now he (gadkari) has to just bring it in front and serve it on the dining table
 gadakari ne kaha ki parivahan mantri ke taur par vah is baat ko samajhate hai ki kai baar kisi bade project ko lekar taiyaari karne, tender nikaalane or kanoonee aupchaariktaayen puraa karne main kaaphi samay lag jaataa he
 But when the work starts, then the result starts appearing

 Under this department, important department like Namami Gange is connected, which is the dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 ab uma bharti ke paas sirf peyajal or sanitessan jaise maamuli mantralay hi bache hai

 It is believed that the anger of the lawyers against Kiran Bedi is very old when in 1988, while being the DCP of North Delhi, she lathi-charged the lawyers of Tisahjari

 Due to the sourness and tension between the husband and wife, many times divorce is also reached
 kai baar dampatti bich-bachaav yaa samjhaute ke iraade se vakil yaa counslar ke paas bhi pahunchate hai
 Now the video of the couple reaching out to one such female counselor is going viral on social media
 isamen dekha ja saktaa he ki pati-patni se baat karte karte mahila counslar apni seat se uthati he or pati par danaadan kai tamaache jad detii he
 The four-minute viral video containing this 'on the Spot' decision was uploaded on 20 July 2018 from a Facebook profile
 isko ab tak lagbhag 10 lakh se zyada log dekh chuke he
 More than ten thousand people have shared it
 do hazaar se zyada log video par apni pratikriya de chuke he
 Many people are praising the counselor
 kuch ne counslar kii ore se kanoon ko is tarah apane haath main lene ko sahi nahin mana
 Why did the female counselor take the step of beating the man in the couple who came for advice like this? That too with live recording on camera
 india today kii fact check team ne puure maamle kii tahakikat karne kaa faisla kiya
 Seeing the recording, it became known that all this happened in an office-like room
 offis main pati-patni or counslar hi dikhte hai
 The counselor first listens to the couple and then asks for a mobile from the wife and shows a message on the camera with 'divorce' written on it
 iske baad counslar camere kii ore dekhte hue dampatti main pati kaa naam aabid mastaan or mahila kaa naam shayara aabid mastaan bataati he
 After this, she gets up from her seat and reaches the man and says "kya Maulana said to you that sending SMS by writing" divorce "in this way leads to divorce, you defame Islam
 " iske baad counslar purush ko ek ke baad ek kai tamaache raseed karti he
 At the same time, his ears also rise
 mahila counsar phir waapas apni seat par aakar farmaan sunaati he- "ek letters likh kar detii hum, tum ise ghar par le kar jaao
 The girl should not have any problem
 ” counslar ke tevar dekhakar purush itnaa hi bol paata he- "ji madam, mai le jaaoongaa apni patni ko ghar
 "the tone of the conversation happening in the video is usually heard only in Mumbai or Maharashtra
 fact check team ne phir video kii jaanch kaa rukh phir mumbai kii taraf modaa
 Investigation revealed that the female counselor appearing in the video runs an NGO called "help Care Foundation"
 mahila kaa naam shabnam shaikh he lekin sab inhen shabnam aapa ke naam se jaanate hai
 When asked about the video from Shabnam Sheikh, he said, "the thing shown in the video is absolutely true and we had beaten that person
 ladki ne hamen shikaayat kii thi ki uske pati ne SMS se talaak bhej kar 9 maheene pehle ghar se nikaal diya
 The person who wrote the divorce on SMS is from Ghatkopar, Mumbai
 shikaayat milane ke baad maine dampatti ko 14 july 2018 ko bandra main apane offis bulaayaa tha
 Earlier, there was an attempt to make a reconciliation between the two
 SMS se talaaq dene ke sawaal par maine use peeta tha
 Now see husband and wife are well together after beating
 ”or khoj bin main yah pataa chalaa ki dabang style main enjio chalaane vaali mahila soshal varkar nasha mukti centre bhi chalaati he
 Checked their Facebook account and saw that in other cases, they themselves become judges and listen to the complainants and then give the verdict, along with showing the entire proceedings live
 is viral video ko bhi khud shabnam shaikh ne apane fasebuk handle se live kiya tha
 Earlier, while handling the case, Shabnam Sheikh has beaten others like this
 shabnam shaikh isse pehle bhi surkhiyon main rahi hai
 When Bigg Boss contestant Zubair Khan was kicked out of the show by Salman Khan
 us samay shabnam shaikh jubair khan ke samarthan main aakar salmaan khan ke viruddh baaten kii thi
 Later, after receiving a threat of Rs 1 crore from the Ravi Pujari gang, he also took protection from the police
 viral testmen sabit hua ki video main jo dikhaaya ja rahaa he wo sach he or vaaki SMS ke sawaal par counslar ne purush kii pitayee kii thi

 ' film rivyuu: khubasuratstar cast: sonam kapur, favad khan, ratna pathak shah, kiran kher, aamir rajadiarector: shashaank ghoshduration: 130 mintereting: 3yah film 1980 main rishikesh mukherjee kii film 'khubasurat' kaa rimek he
 a middle-class simplicity and the neat thanjo-latif have often been present in the plot of Rishikesh
 jaise hero heroin se achaar maang rahaa ho or vah khatta khaane ke man ko lekar use chhedane lage
 But in the new 'beautiful' this middle class simplicity has been replaced by a variety of grandeur
 isse nuksaan yah hua he ki vah atirikt humar jo madhyavargeey prishthbhumi main aa saktaa tha, nahin aa paaya
 Film Review: Rekha gave a great performance in the film Finding Fanirishikesh
 is film main sonam kapur ke kaam ko ausat aanka ja saktaa he, par bura nahin
 Sonam comes from a rich film background and her image is also of a fashion icon
 aise main unke acting paksh ko lekar bahut saare critic aalochak mudra main hi rahete hai or unhen khaarij karnaa apana ferj samajhate hai
 But it has to be decided whether the audience in the film goes to see the personality of Sonam Kapoor or the Sonam Kapoor actress
 us bagez ko peeche chode jane kii jarurat he
 Sonam's romantic scenes are good, but in the case of Humer, she is average
 aawaaj or imoshans ke utaar-chadhaav unke chehre par bahut achche se nahin aa paae
 Still their performance does not look bad
 movie rivyuh bipasha basu kii krichar 3deepakistani actor favad khan ne shandaar kaam kiya he
 Girls will find him 'yummy', 'dashing' and 'cute'
 pehle half kii parformens main story kii demand ke mutabik unke kirdaar main ek rigervaness he
 His character opens in the second half, but with little hesitation
 favad ke bare main khaas baat yah he ki unhen muskuraana aata he
 One is smiling, one is tearing teeth, one is laughing showing teeth and one is smiling through eyes
 ankhon se muskuraana saundaryashastra main sabase uttam mana gaya he
 He comes to Fawad
 ladkiyaan unhen pasand karengi or haul main unhen dekhakar 'au vaau' prakaar kii awaajen nikaalengi
 Story: Sambalgarh is a place in the Punjabi Tarkarajasthan in the Royal Family
 ek accident main chalane-phirane kii takat kho chuke raja sahab yahaan apane parivaar ke saath rahete hai
 Rani Sahiba is a bit strict and everyone lives under her cane
 rishikesh mukherjee kii khubasurat main yah role dina pathak ne kiya tha
 The film stars his daughter Ratna Pathak
 noujvaan rajukmaar he vikram
 Her younger sister is Divya
 prince vikram kii mumbai kii ek ladki kiyaara se sagaai ho chuki he
 The problem is that the doctor who comes to treat Raja Saheb does not last
 phir ek physio ladki aati he dow
 Mrinalini Chakraborty aka Mili
 mili kii maa punjabi hai to ve gun use viraasat main mili hai
 His unassuming and loud personality does not fit into the Royal Family
 raja sahab bhi ilaaj main uskaa sahyog nahin karte
 Then one day he learns a story that Vikram had an elder brother, Ambar, who was gifted a sports car by Raja Saheb
 use lekar raja sahab car main ghoomane nikle the ki accident ho gaya or ambar kii maut ho gai
 Raja Saheb remained in a coma
 jab hosh aayaa to chalane-phirane kii takat ja chuki thi
 Millie learns that Raja Saheb considers himself guilty for Amber's death and for this reason does not seek his help to recover
 iske baad mili raja ko thik karne main nae sire se jute jaati he
 Meanwhile, in Milli and engaged Vikram, Pyar Ki Pinga grows up and the rest comes twists
 aakhir main kahani yahi sthapit karti he ki pyaar karne ke liye do logon kaa ek becoground kaa hona jaruri nahin hota
 Punjabi Manfavad Khan's airing of the Royal Family has good comic timing
 lekin kamedi kii sabase zyada sambhaavnaaon vaala role kiran kher ke hisse aayaa he
 She plays the role of a middle class Punjabi mother from Delhi, who churns out the Royal Family from her slick Punjabi jumals
 ab to lagata he ki punjabi maa kaa role kiran kher ke naam patent kar diya gaya he
 When she comes on screen, laughter starts bursting out
 raja ke role main aamir raja ne bhi prabhavit kiya he
 The king who lives a sad and lonely life, but after a time, chides with Miley like a child
 is role ko aamir ne bakhubi nibhaayaa he
 Never seen them before, may have seen but can't remember
 kahani ko dhimaa nahin karte hai ganefilm kii khubi yah bhi he ki gane ridam ko nahin todate hai
 a song like 'teri Maa Ka Phon Aaya' initially comes out at the same time when casting is going on screen
 gane bure nahin hai or jab aate hai to akharate nahin hai
 a specialty of the film is that it is a very stylish film
 mana bhi jane laga he ki jis film main sonam hongi to vah stylish to hogi hi
 Her dress and her color combination are worth seeing in the film
 ladkiyaan film dekhne jaaengi to unki dress par bhi khub gaur karengi
 The interior of the rest of the palace, cars, horses and all such small things are in the background
 film zyada lambii nahin he
 Director Shashank Ghosh looks forward to hoping that he will do more in the future
 behatar hota ki vah har vakt kahani ko mili par kendrit na rakhte hue anya chote-chote kirdaaron ko bhi shaamil kiya jaataa
 But overall Shashank's work is also good
 sonam kapur kii 'khubasurat' timopas film he
 You will laugh and have some fun
 agar sonam kapur se parhez nahin he to dekhne jaaen
 But do not carry the hangover of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's 'beautiful', because it was a 'cult film' and beautiful things cannot be copied

 On this, Janata Dal u General Secretary Shyam Rajak said that he is not a part of UPA and his alliance is only in Bihar
 raashtrapati kaa chunaav rashtriya str par hota he
 Shyam Rajak said that his party thoughtfully supported Ramnath Kovind
 congressi netaa gulam nabi aaazaad par hamalaa karte hue shyaam rajak ne kaha ki unhen apane girebaan main jhaankna chahie ki nehru or rajeev gandhi ke siddhant kya the
 If they study their principles, then their questions will be answered automatically

 They talk of presidential selection on the basis of candidates
 chennai main netaaon ne bhi kai suzav die the or un sujhaavon par charchaa nahin hui
 Regarding Ram Nath Kovind, he says that he did not get a good name with reference to Bihar
 daliton or rajya ke hitamen ve ram nath kovind kaa samarthan kar rahe hai
 They speak of the right decision and deny any differences
 shyaam rajak ne kaha ki haar kaa thikra congress par footnaa chahie
 He has stood up to humiliate a Dalit woman as Bihar's daughter, Meera Kumar
 unhen to soch samajhakar pehle nirnay lenaa chahie tha
 They do not have votes

 In this, they mention being humiliated

 During that time, Bihar's daughter was not remembered
 us vakt to duusare logon ko yaad kiya gaya
 On the issue of re-support with BJP, Shyam Rajak bluntly said that he has been with BJP for 17 years
 nitigat matbhed par ve alag ho gaye
 He still speaks of being against the BJP on the question of farmers
 ve kehete hai ki bijepi kii aarthik niti bhi unke khilaaf he

 ve sawaal gaayab ho gaye
 They call the presidential election a losing bet
 ve kehete hai ki is chunaav ko praathamikta dena congress ke diwaliyapan kaa dyotak he

 On Tuesday evening, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar hit back at Giriraj Singh's tweet, saying that Giriraj Singh does such tweets only to remain in the headlines

 Only after this statement of Nitish Kumar, Amit Shah intervened in this whole matter and instructed Giriraj Singh
 amit shah ne giriraj singh ko phone karke kaha ki is tarah kii shikaayat aage se nahin aani chahie
 Let us know that before Amit Shah and Nitish Kumar, this statement of Giriraj Singh was also condemned by LJP leader Chirag Paswan
 unhone enditivi se baatcheet main kaha ki giriraaj sar (giriraj Singh) aise twit karte rahete hai
 i think the media is taking Giriraj Singh's tweet a little too seriously
 is vivaad main giriraaj singh ko clinit dene par chiraag paswan ne kaha ki nirantarata main unke kai bayaan aae hai
 There should never be a politics of appeasement, never do politics of religion or caste
 piem ne khud aise bayaanbaji se bachane kii naseehat di thi
 However, we each have our own ideology
 ham usee par chal rahe hai
 During the conversation when he was asked if you would meet Giriraj Singh? Would you ask them why you tweeted so? On this, Chirag Paswan said that i will definitely ask him when i meet him, but i feel that we are giving too much attention to the statement of any one

 iske lekhak mohankrishna bohara ne isamen tasalima kii pustakon kii vishaywastu ko puure vistaar main sametate hue uskaa jayja liya he
 This sequence opens Tasleema's life from autobiographical books and her literary-conceptual expressions from novels, poetry, story and other thought books
 is tarah saadhe chah sau pannon kii yah pustak dher saare vivaranon or aavashyaktaanusaar vishleshan ke jariye tasalima kii shakhsiyat kaa ek mukammal khaakaa pesh karti he
 In this, the author has tried to see the details of the consciousness of a rebellious, frivolous and convincing figure of complete freedom of the person within the logical periphery of the same
 bohara tasalima kii aatmakatha ke prasangon ko uddhrut karte hue kam umr se hi unke anyaay-virodh kii bhaavana ko rekhaankit karte hai
 a young girl creates a fantasy to do nothing but punish the unjust, in which she herself will scorch a neighbor who burns a wife
 tasalima kaa pratirodhi swabhaav samaaj ke dasturon se talmail nahin baitha paata
 They disguise the lies of mother, father, brother, sister and the innermost of themselves, and Bohra dissects this incision
 id ke din bado ke pair chhukar salaam karne kii ravaayat ko naamanzoor karne vaali tasalima ke bare main ve kehete hai—''kya yah bahari duniya main apni aatmaheenata ke pratikaar main ubhar rahaa uskaa ahan nahin tha, jo ghar main bado kii apratishtha karke tosh paa rahaa tha?''bohara note karte hai ki maa ke prati tasalima kii bhaavana main kai utaar-chadhaav rahe hai
 After all, what was the content that made the grudge against the tormented mother all her life? The bitterness that began with seeing her own rapist on her mother's bed
 bohara ke mutabik, tasalima ne is ghatana ko pita ke prati maa ke vishwasghaat ke rup main dekha tha, or jis 'dekhne' ko baad main unhone bahari prabhaavon main bani khud kii 'purushatantric drushti' ke rup main karact kiya
 But a husband who neglects his wife and keeps the relationship elsewhere and finally waits for her death, does not embrace the wife's humbistry as a betrayal of a logical woman like Taslima
 dilachasp yah bhi he ki jis vishwasghaat ko baad ke dinon main khud tasalima ne thukraayaa, use yahaan pustak lekhak ne 'satya' qaraar dete hue jhat se samarthan de diya he
 From this it seems that there is a difference of opinion in both the people on the issues of social morality and personal freedom, which is also seen elsewhere
 masalan katha-pustak do auraton ke patr kii nayika ke hawaale se tasalima dwaara ek vivaahit stri ke anyatra shaareerik sambandh ke samarthan kaa maamla
 According to the heroine, "if i remain 100 percent true and honest, if i establish a physical relationship with another man, then it does not harm anyone; Neither mine nor Humayun's
 '' ise bohara vastunishth auchity se pare tasalima kii aatmanishth dharna tehraate hai, kyonki isse 'pati ke usamen vishwaas kaa nuksaan' hoga
 Similarly, Bohra seems grossly disagreeable with the idea of rejecting Taslima's family organization
 alabatta ve tasalima ko bhashaa par acha adhikaar rakhane vaali nipun lekhika kehete hai jinke paas amoort kaa moort rachane or shabdon se khilne kaa kaushal he
 Kitab: Tatsalima: Conflict and Literature Writer: Mohankrishna Bohra Prakasak: Vani Prakashan: 895 Rs
 pustak sara charchit lekhika ke jivan or lekhan par ek vyapak drushti It may seem strange to read and listen, but this is the truth
 3 din se lekar ek maheene ke shishu ke khun kii jaanch karwaai jaae to kai aisi metabolic bimariyon kaa pataa chal saktaa he, jinka ilaaj shuru main hi sambhav he or navjaat baccha puri tarah se thik ho saktaa he
 One of these diseases is PKU
 isamen navjaat ke sharir main ek anzime kii kami se amino-acid duusare protein main badal nahin paata or navjaat ke sharir main wo ikattha hota rahata he, jisase bachche ko kai samasyaayein paidaa ho jaati he
 In a three-day conference organized at AIIMS on the same subject, doctors from all over the country and abroad gave information about all the child baby screening tests about which people do not even know about them
 ames main genetic visheshgy dow
 According to Madhulika Cobra, these tests can detect not only metabolic disorder but also many genetic diseases immediately after the birth of a child
 in bimariyon kaa ilaaj sambhav nahin he, lekin yadi parents ko inke bare main shuru main hi pataa chal jaae to bachche kii parvarish, uske khaane-pine se lekar uske ilaaj ke liye puri planning taiyaar kii ja sakati he
 At the same time, the parents also know the child's disease very early
 ames main unamem se kai test kii pradarshnee bhi kii gai, jo desh main bilkul nae hai or inke jariye bacchon main hone vaale bahut se disorder kaa pataa kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, in a kit made of a special paper, the blood of a newborn can be taken for examination and 40 types of disorder can be detected from this sample
 aankaden bhi bataate hai ki dilli jaise mahanagar main rojaanaa ek yaa do aise bachche paidaa hote hai jo kisi naa kisi metabalik disorder se jujh rahe hote hai
 It is a matter of concern that the parents are not yet aware of the baby screening test
 wo lambey samay tak jaan hi nahin pate ki unka baccha kis disorder se jujh rahaa he or uskaa ilaaj kya he
 It is the advice of doctors that the child should have a blood screening test done immediately after birth
 khaastaur par wo shishu jinke pariwaron main janitic beemaari kii history he
 Along with this, Thalisemia, Diabetes, Hypothyroidism disease, if anyone in the family, then get blood screening done

 Winter is not a good season for shabby, weak and sick people
 iskaa ehsaas is baar ke chunaav nateezon ke baad congress ko ho rahaa hoga
 After three and a half wins (the biggest party in Delhi is not able to laugh openly), bjp's PM candidate candidate's seat may have widened slightly but the victory of the leaders of the states can also prove to be a future challenge for them
 vahiin aap ke rup main bhartiya raajnneeti main ek 'sarprise element’ jud gaya he
 You may not even know who will hurt whom and whom
 desh ab ek dilachasp garmiyon kii ore bad rahaa he
 Such is the danger of political loss that the Congress high command has now started finding answers within itself
 haalanki ab bahut der ho chuki he
 Three-time Chief Minister Sheila Dixit in Delhi, as if she was mixed up in the dust, surely she paid the penalty of being the head of the capital of the country in the era of Manmohan Singh
 rajasthan main buree tarah alokapriy ho chuke ashok gahalot to pichley paanch saal maano apni party ko gart main le jane kii hi kasarat karte rahe
 Jyotiraditya Scindia, Union Minister of State for Power (independent Charge), who was late in Madhya Pradesh, could not die in the Congress lying in a coma
 sirf padosi chhattisgarh main hi congress badi mushkil se sammanjanak paraajay hasil kar pai
 Combining the results of these four states, overall it is a wonderful example of lazy leadership and careless politics
 kabhi vah daur tha jab congress dilli main sarvocch netaa or rajyon main karishmai tathaa janaadhar vaale netaaon ke kaaran maje main rahaa karti thi
 Both were complementary to each other
 rajyon ke kshatrap apane kilon ko durust rakhte the, taaki rashtriya netaa apni deshvyapee patakatha ko aage badha sake
 But now the Congress high command — Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi — communicate with the country only when elections are held
 rajya yaa to kshatrap viheen hai yaa phir niskriy ho chuke kathputli netaaon ke hawaale hai
 Shivraj Singh Chauhan, who is now roaming around the head of bjp's hat-trick in Madhya Pradesh, was not cutting back on the Congress when he was consolidating his land as an ambassador for the spread and development of Hindutva

 rajyon kaa netritv barbaad ho rahaa tha, par centre bhi sarvanaash kii raah se hatane ko taiyaar nahin tha
 Sonia Gandhi's voice was sometimes heard in a symbolic intervention, but the nation heard and rejected Rahul Gandhi's voice

 ve rahul to yugon pehle ke lagate hai, jo apni party kaa loktantr virdohi sanshodhan prastaav faad aae or pradhanmantri kii galatiyon kaa izhaar kiya
 He was missing in the election field
 chunaav nateezon ne rahul ke upar bada prashnchinh laga diya he
 Failure to move forward on the promises he briefly made in 2009 and his inability to fill the vacant space created by the pm's ineffective and weak leadership have led many in his party to wonder whether in the future He will be able to lead the party

 His shiny bud had already landed
 jab bhi unki sarkaar kaa koi ghotaalaa ujagar hota, pradhanmantri aise pesh aate maano ve is sarkaar ke hissaa hi na hon
 Whenever the country asked for an answer, they would resort to formulas and fantasies
 jab sadakon par gussa umadaye laga or desh ko netritv kii darkaar thi, ve aise khol main simat jate ki kahin koi unhen netaa na bataa de
 Above all, when the market was groaning with the economic downturn, they stared helplessly

 Manmohan has become redundant when the country is demanding leadership
 isliye rahul kii samasya modi nahin, balki manmohan hai or iskaa koi samaadhaan bhi nahin dikhataa he
 Encouraged by the UPA government providing the ground and making Modi the prime ministerial candidate, the BJP has been preparing to write a script for victory, gaining renewed vigor from the performance of its satraps in the states
 chouhan or raman singh kii hetric sarkaar viradhi rujhaanon se paar paane kaa anokhi misaal pesh karti he
 The vote in Madhya Pradesh was not received for Chauhan's resolve to protect the sacred cows from the vows or for his plans for Vedic education in schools, but the investment in his social and physical infrastructure

 But in Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already lost the shine of bjp's victory due to the overwhelming performance in the electoral battle
 bijepi ke hnatrapon kii toli main nae-nae shaamil harshavardhan ke netritv main bijepi sabase badi party ke rup main ubharne ke baavjood dilli main sarkaar nahin bana saki
 The political managers of the party are concerned that if you succeed in leaving a similar image at the national level, it will not only eat away the anti-congress votes but will also become a viable option for those who oppose both national parties
 We do
 akali dal ke ek varisht saansad kehete hai, ''un sabhi logon ke liye jo paramparaagat dalon se duuri bananaa chaahate hai, ve (aap) kuch alag peshkash lekar aae hai
 "most of the experts still do not believe that you will be able to replicate the success achieved in Delhi at the national level, but the fact that AAP is working and the way it has done BJP, Congress, The votes of traditional parties like BSP have been captured, this has created a danger of the game of these established parties deteriorating
 bispi ke ek rajyasabha saansad sweekaar karte hai, ''yah khatre kii ghanti he

 Right now, the weakness of the Congress at the national level and the units hitching in the states are proving to be a boon for the BJP
 bijepi ko centre main modi jaisaa ek bharosemand senapati or rajyon main kushal yoddhaon ke hone kaa bhi laabh mila he
 Despite this, Modi's war is now moving towards inaccessible plains
 uttar pradesh or bihar ke ahm rajya main unhen adhamare virdohi par waar karne kii suvidha nahin he
 There, not the Congress, but they will face many regional parties who are strong in keeping a strong hold on their social base

 Even in the south, the Congress is not as strong, but the BJP is not at all an alternative to non-congressism

 The country is waiting for that round to stop breathing

 The judgment said that the goal of the entire investigation was to work on a script to achieve that point

 In this way, the CBI implicated the policemen who had no knowledge about any conspiracy

 ''baharhaal, netaaon par is sarkari meharbaani ko dekhakar gurtu or verma ne maamle ko court main le jane kaa man banaaya or aktubar 2010 main jabalpur hycourt main janhit yachika lagaai
 He demanded the abolition of the quota of mps-mlas as illegal
 netaaon kii jaalsaji kaa sira pehali baar tab pakad main aane laga jab yachikakarta ke vakil siddharth radhelaal gupta ne sitambar 2011 main ku chha vidhayakon or saansadon ke do-do ghar hone ke artiai dastavej or chunaav ayog main di gai jaanakri court main daayar kii jisamen yah saaf likhaa tha ki in netaaon ke kahaan-kahaan nijee ghar hai
 On 7 November 2011, the court gave the board a last chance and said it would give its verdict if they did not respond in fifteen days
 november ke aakhri hafte main board ne apana jawaab daakhil kiya
 In the next hearing, Gupta told the court that three mlas - three mps in MP MLA quota have given wrong information and misused the quota
 unhone kaha ki vidhayakon or saansadon ne jhootha shapath patr dekar ghar liye hai, isliye is tarah ke cote ko hataa dena chahie
 After this, on 9 April, the High Court issued a notice regarding the making of 6 leaders as parties
 aakhir apaatr netaaon ko ye makaan kaise mili, is sawaal par houseing board ke ayukta arun bhatta ne yah maasoom daleel di, ''mujhe is pad par aae hue abhi teen maheene hue hai, lekin mananeey nyaayalay ko board ne avgat kara diya he ki saansad-vidhayak cote se sambandhit niyam unke socity ke broshar main rahete hai or saansad-vidhayakon ko niyam maaloom the
 They are responsible for this
 '' madhya pradesh ke baahar ke saansad ko aavanton ke sawaal par bhatta ne kaha ki puraane maamle kii jaanch kara rahe hai or niyam ke anusaar karrwai karenge
 He expressed helplessness, "documents cannot be checked from door to door and can be investigated only on receipt of complaint
 maamle main court kaa aadesh mana jayega
 At the same time, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan deferred the reply citing the case being in the High Court
 madhya pradesh vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ajay singh kaa kahana he ki vidhayakon or saansadon dwaara galat jaankaree dena thik nahin he, lekin maamle kii puri jaanch honi chahie ki board ke kin adhikariyon ne apni jimmedaari puri nahin kii or un par bhi karrwai honi chahie
 Gurtu said that the misuse of the quota can be gauged from the fact that the Delhi MP also got a house here
 kya houseing board ke afasaron ko yah nahin pataa ki saansad madhya pradesh kaa nahin he
 He said that they are now ascertaining the allotment rule of 146 duplex houses allotted to mps and mlas in Riviera Town in Bhopal, including the duplexes of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj
 isko houseing board ne banaaya tha lekin aavanton vidhansabha adhyaksh kii samiti ne kiya he
 Though this announcement is only with the Madhya Pradesh Housing Board, but similar quota development authorities, city improvement trusts, state cooperative housing associations are also there

 While Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has mainly attributed the top leadership of the Congress to the opposition to the GST Bill, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh claimed that the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were, in fact, against it

 iske pehle bataaya gaya tha ki pakistan main rahete hue gita ko jab mahato parivaar kii tasviir bheji gai thi to usne unki pahchaan apane maa-baap ke rup main kii thi
 However, this will be revealed only after the DNA report comes
 gita ko apni beti bataate hue desh ke kai hisson se logon ne daawa kiya tha
 There were peaceful demonstrations in hundreds of places in the country, people gathered and came and went
 gambhirtha se kisi ne un pradarshnon ko bhi nahin liya
 Otherwise, some way of talking to them could be worked out
 ab bhi hinsak pradarshnon se zyaada shantipurna pradarshnon kii sankhya hi zyada hogi
 The number of protesters was very high in Mewat, Haryana, but there was no violence there
 bihar ke purniya main bhi kaaphi badi raily hui lekin vahaan bhi hinsa nahin hui
 How many people came to Mumbra in Mumbai
 kerala ke trichi main bhi baari sankhya main log jamaa hue magar hinsa nahin hui
 There was also a big march in Nagpur
 agar ginati kii jaae ki kahaan kahaan badi raily hui or hinsa nahin hui to unki sankhya zyaada hogi
 But when violence happens, many questions arise about the role of the people and the police, many types of videos come
 media donon ko chhod detaa he
 His emphasis is only on pictures of violence but is not interested in discovering the cause
 police ke bayaan hi haaavee hote hai
 The bulk of the channels' time goes into debates
 log whatsap main video thel thel kar jawaab thundhate rahete hai
 For example, you will not see the story of the families of those who have died
 hinsa hoti he to logon kaa paksh kamazor ho jaataa he
 It also has a system
 isiilie gandhi ji ne chauri chaura kii hinsa ke baad asahyog andolan waapas le liya tha
 When the display is out of control it should be stopped
 hinsa ke kai kaaran hote hai phir bhi iskaa sabase bura asar pradarshan ke nattejey par padataa he
 Those who are listening carefully also stop listening on the pretext of violence
 kai pradarshnon main hinsa badhane lagi he
 a trend is visible
 jahaan zyaada se zyaada sankhya main log aa rahe hai vahaan hinsa nahin he
 Violence is decreasing where there are relatively few people
 hinsa ke baad viral hone vaale video se turant kisi nattejey par nahin pahunchnaa chahie
 Do not get excited
 lekin in video ko khaarij kar dena yaa kinare laga dena bhi thik nahin he jo ki ho rahaa he
 In this time reporting, videos of the police role have gone missing
 un par thik se or thos tareeke se baat nahin he
 There is a video of Bahraich in which you can see how the police are nabbing the protesters
 uskaa makasad bhay se niyantran se zyada kuch or lagata he
 People are doing nothing in response
 sirf peeche hatate ja rahe hai lekin police shant nahin dikhti he
 Being killed by sticks aap yah tasviir dekhar turant ek nattejey par pahunchenge lekin iske thik pehle kya hua pataa nahin
 Yet this picture distracts
 gorakhpur ke ek video main aap dekh sakate hai ki donon taraf se pathar chal rahe hai
 The police is seen to be stepping stones
 puri gali main eent ke tukade bhar gaye hai
 If you make a video from the other side, only the police will be seen running a brick, but in this video you can see that people from the other side are also stepping stones
 ek kism kaa morcha khulaa hua he
 In many videos people are seen stepping stones
 kai baar pradarshnakariyon ke bich se hi pathar chalate hai
 Look clearly kai baar pathar chalaane waalon kii pahchaan par vivaad hua he
 It was stated in Seelampur and Lucknow that he was not part of the protest
 unki pahchaan kuch or thi
 This type of dispute happens
 kahin log police kii chapet main hai to kahin police logon kii chapet main he
 Police were caught in Ahmedabad
 yah drishy bhayaavah tha lekin isi bheed se saat ladke nikal kar aate hai or police vaale ko bachaate hai
 In some of the videos, the police are seen stumbling after the violence
 gharon main ghus kar police kii barbarta ke kai video aae hai jinaki koi zarurat nahin thi
 If the stones have gone on the road, then in response to this, the police cannot enter any house and grab women or men and beat them
 ye pulising nahin he
 Police is reducing the use of water splashes
 sidhe lathi, or aansu gas ke gole daagne ke vijual aa rahe hai
 Even when the crowd has gone away
 ek duusare ko video farverd kar painic na machaaen
 Many times, old videos are also forwarded in this affair and the forwarded video of one city starts being forwarded in the name of another city
 upi ke teraa shaharon main pradarshnon ke dauraan hinsa hui he
 Just last month, when there was a decision on the Babri Masjid and Ramjanmabhoomi dispute, how much was the security prepared
 tab to koi hinsa nahin hui
 Then why is every other protest in UP getting violent? Are people the only reason? Not police at all? In two days, 7 people died from the bullet and police say that he did not fire
 kya yah yakeen karne laayak tark he yaa tathy he
 Two people have also died in Mangaluru
 police ke jo bhi tark hon, log apni taraf se saboot or video lekar gum rahe hai
 So the police is not questioned on behalf of the people's argument, it only goes that the people committed violence
 police bhi apni taraf se kai baar nahin bataati he ki uski taraf se kitni hinsa hui
 She always seems to be right when it is not
 jamiya millia main hui barbarta ke baad police ne pehali press conferes main yah baat nahin bataai ki teen logon ko goli lagi he
 Many types of theory were given by the police
 police ne kaha ki bullate nahin he
 Then said that Desi Katta is run and some outsider drove
 phir video aa gaya ki police ke haath main hi pistaul he
 She is firing medico legal report main likhaa he ki shoeb or ejaz ko police firing ke kaaran bullate injuri hui he
 Now it is not discussed
 jamiya kii librari main koun si hinsa ho rahi thi jahaan ladakiyon ko maaraa gaya
 All questions are missing
 kai tarah ke video se guzarate hue police kii soch main bhayankar sampradayikta bhi dikhi
 In many videos, officers and soldiers are heard abusing
 apane afasaron se bhi gaaliyon se baat kar rahe hai or logon se bhi
 Apart from abuses, the use of communal language is also common
 lekin media ise mahatv nahin detaa he
 There is another face in the police which is not the face of the police but it is in the police itself
 bangularu main police ne jin pradarshnakariyon ko hiraasat main liya unhen ek marij haal main lekar gai
 He was also fed tamote rice sambar rasam and curd rice

 Both the police and the public sang public hymns and returned in a peaceful manner

 kahin pradarshan pradarshnkaree ke kaaran hinsak hota he to kahin police ke kaaran bhi pradarshan hinsak ho jate hai
 The Prime Minister has a meeting on Sunday at Ramlila Maidan
 kya dilli police dhara 144 laga legi? zaahir he nahin lagaaegi
