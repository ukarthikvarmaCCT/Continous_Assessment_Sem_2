 air india kii dubai ja rahi ek vimaan main savaar yatri or chaalak dal ke sadsy raat us vakt kuch samay ke liye chintit ho gaye jab bajpe hawaii adde par udaan bharne ke liye ja rahe vimaan ko waapas bula liya gaya

 Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, recently said something strange during the Bharataram Memorial Lecture
 unki raay thi ki vishwa arthvyavastha kii ‘‘chaal pehle se kahin dhimi or apane bazaaron tak simit he isliye hamen apni vruddhi ke liye kshetreey or gharelu maangon par focus karnaa hoga
 Their intention was that the goal of "make in India" would be to create a predominantly indigenous market
 ’’ rajan ne is tarah se desh ke liye niryatonmukhi vruddhi kii avadharana ko khaarij kar diya
 a plea of his offer also turns out that mass production cannot be the basis of a "make in India" campaign
 yakeenan, mukhyadhara ke arthshaastri rajan kii in nitigat siforeeshon se shaayad hi asahmat hon
 Subsidizing exports may not be a better way to promote export-oriented development
 vaise bhi vishwa vyapaar sanghathan ne aisi sabsidi par pratibandh laga rakhaa he
 Similarly, with all restrictions on trade, import-based industrialization is also not a better solution
 vaaki, main ek kadam aage badhkar vyapaar udaarikaran kii phir shuruyaat karne kii peshkash karuunga, jo 2007-08 se rukaa hua he, jab rajasav kaa lakshya ghatane laga tha
 However, Rajan ignores an important question here
 vah sawaal yah he ki shram-shakti kii prachurtaa vaala bharat audyogic badlaav kii us raah se kaise batch saktaa he jis par chalakar shram-shakti kii prachurtaa vaali har kaamyaab arthvyavastha ne use apanaaya he? bharat main is vakt kaam karne waalon kii kareeb 50 karod kii fouj he or isamen har saal 1
 2 crores is increasing
 ab bhi khaasaa garib hone ke kaaran desh main puunji kaa simit bhandar hi he or adhikansh shram-shakti akushal he
 In these circumstances, how will we be able to provide good jobs on a large scale to people who are waiting for employment? Today, about half of the labor force is based on agriculture, which contributes less than 15 percent to the national gross domestic product (GDP)
 iske alaava, 40 fisadi se adhik shram-shakti asangathit kshetra main lagi hui he
 Under these circumstances, is there a way that does not pass through the services sector such as industry and construction, such as stitched garments that consume heavy labor force, yet in the next decade about one-third of the workforce is better off in the private sector Can create jobs? Rajan does not elaborate on this path and i too cannot think of that
 bharat main kai log aisa sochate hai ki desh utpaadan kshetra se chalaang lagaakar america kii tarah seva kshetra kii arthvyavastha vaali sthiti main pahunch jayega
 They do not realize that only after decades of top class training can we achieve people like America
 philhal to seva kshetra main zyada naukariyaan kam vetan vaali or asangathit kshetra main hi hai
 In the 2006–07 National Sample Survey it was revealed that 1 of the service sector
 5 karod udhyamon main sabase bade 626 main se 38 fisadi sevaayen muhaiyaa karaate hai or maje kii baat dekhie ki inamen mahaj 2 fisadi shram-shakti hi lagi hui he
 There is also a big misconception that exports can only grow rapidly in a fast growing world economy
 hakeekat yah he ki 1995 se 2013 ke bich jab china kaa niryaat oochaal le rahaa tha to argenigeshan for iconomic ko-oparation and deveopment (oisidi) ke deshon main yah mahaj 1
 It was growing at the rate of 4 percent per annum
 siddhant rup main dhimi vaishvik vruddhi ke dauraan niryaat main badhotaree main aadchan tabhi paidaa hoti he jab ek hi samay main ek hi saamaan kai desh bana rahe hon
 However, these types of situations never happen
 itihaas main baari shram-shakti aadhaarit utpaadon ke niryaat main ek saath badhotaree kaa lakshya hasil karne vaale vikasshil deshon kii sankhya bas mutthi bhar hi to rahi he
 In the 1960s and 1970s, such countries have been South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong
 phir, in purvi asian sheron main jaise hi vetan main badhotaree hui, 1980 ke dashak main unki jagah china ne le lee
 And now that salaries have increased in China, Vietnam and Cambodia can be seen emerging among the competitive exporters of these products
 rajan kaa yah kahana sahi he ki duniya main china jaisi do arthvyavasthaaon kii jagah nahin ban sakati, lekin yah bharat ke kaamyaab niryaatak banane ke maamle main sahi nahin ho saktaa
 Today, China's exports are 12 percent of the world's trade and less than 2 percent of India's
 lekin, baari shram-shakti or apekshaakrit kaaphi kam tankhwaahon ke saath bharat agle paanch saal main china se kareeb 2 fisadi ank kyon nahin jhatak saktaa? bas isi se shvishwa arthvyavastha ke liye ‘‘mek in india’’ abhiyaan ko kaaphi sahaara mil saktaa he
 If we do not dream big, then we cannot make inroads in the market of labor-intensive products in the world
 niryaat ko lekar rajan ke nirashavad ko dhyaan main rakhkar dekhen to isamen aashcharya nahin ki puraane shram kanoonon main sudhaaron kaa rajan kii lambii fehrist main koi zikr nahin he, jo ki utpaadan kshetra main hamen badhat dilaane ke liye behad jaruri hai
 In such a situation, our pessimism about exports becomes a means to appease our emotions and we fall prey to misunderstanding of our policy failures to compete in the world market, and ignore the fact that this market Everything is being seized in China

 Today is the 121st birthday of revolutionary, poet, writer, historian, litterateur Ramprasad Bismil
 bismil ne mahaj 11 saal kii umr main hi swatantraaa andolan main bhaag lenaa shuru kar diya tha
 He was born on 11 June 1897 in Shahjahanpur
 bachapan main ram prasad bismil aryasamaj se prerit the or uske baad ve desh kii aazaadee ke liye kaam karne lage
 Bismil was also associated with Matruvedi Sanstha
 is sanstha main rahete hue unhone angrejon ke khilaaf ladaai ke liye kaaphi hathiyaar ekatrit kiya, lekin angreji sena ko isaki jaankaree mil gai
 The British attacked and recovered a lot of weapons
 is ghatana ko hi mainpuri shadyantra ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 After committing the Kakori incident, he was arrested and put on trial
 jab kakori cond kii vajah se angrejon main hadakamp much gaya
 
 
 Ram Prasad Bismil was hanged on December 19, 1927 by the British for his involvement in the Kakori incident
 bismil kavitaaon or shaayari likhane ke kaaphi shaukeen the
 On the gallows, Bismil read some lions of 'sarfaroshi ki tamanna ab hamare dil mein hai'
 ye sher patna ke azimabad ke mashhoor shaayar bismil azimaabadi kii rachana thi
 But in the public opinion, the identity of this creation became more about Ram Prasad Bismil
 bismil ne hindu-muslim ekta par kaaphi kaam kiye hai or kaaphi likhaa bhi he
 His line 'government called Ashfaqullah Khan as Ramprasad's right hand 
 ashfakulla kattar musalmaan hokar pakke aryasamaji ramprasad kaa krantikari dal kaa haath ban sakate hai, tab kya naye bharatvarsh kii swatantrata ke naam par hindu musalmaan apane nijee chote- chote phaaydon kaa khyaal na karke aapas main ek nahin ho sakate?' kaaphi prasiddh he
 If this revolutionary would have been successful, it would not have happened to hang Bhagat Singh - just before he sacrificed his life for the country on the gallows, Ram Prasad Bismil sang happily and read Bismil's final composition
 '1
 The desire of Sarfaroshi is to be seen in our hearts now, how much power is not lost in Bazu-e-murderer
 The courage of courage, the desire of harsher in the path of non-violence, now let the heart come in our heart, will tell you, o sky, what can we tell from now, what is in our heart, has made everyone slaughtered Hopefully, the lovers today have a desire for Hafarfaroshi in the Scramble cooch-e-katil, now in our heart, the weapon is sitting in the enemy stare, and we are ready for Sina to play our Idharkhoon Holi Gar Vatan is in trouble, the desire of Sarfaroshi is now In our hearts, the hands in which the passion will not be cut with the sword, the head which rises will not bow down with a shout and the anger which is in our heart, the desire of Sarfaroshi is now our de In Leh, we had left the house and tied the shroud on the head, Take your life on your palm, this step has increased, so your guest is in the process of death, the desire to be revolted is now in our heart
 In the storm of storms and the veins in the veins, the enemies will blow us away, do not stop us and stay away from those who are in the destination of their own, what is the body that does not have blood-e-passion What should we fight with those who are in kashti-e-sahil, the desire for Sarfaroshi is in our hearts now

 Why do we forget that the victory of the party is the victory of all of us

 Similarly, at this time we are not in government in many states and are facing tough challenges in many states which are considered our old strongholds

 Commenting on the participation of a large number of youths in the camp this time, he said, another new dimension is also clearly visible in this camp
 yahaan hissaa lene waalon main acchhee khaasi sankhya nai peedi ke pratinidhiyon kii he
 In this, our priority and the changed nature of the country's population and the right picture of youth is found in it

 An inclusive approach is not a political ploy for us to win elections and run a government

 This is not the result of any compulsion, like some of our opponents are

 Two forms of Lord Vishnu are mentioned in the Puranas
 ek rup main to unhen bahut shant, prasann or komal bataaya gaya he or duusare rup main prabhu ko bahut bhayanak bataaya gaya he
 Where Shrihari is sitting in a comfortable posture on Kaal Swaroop Sheshnag
 lekin prabhu kaa rup koi bhi ho, unka hryday to komal he or tabhi to unhen kamalakant or bhaktavatsal kaha jaataa he
 It is said that the calm face of Lord Vishnu inspires a person to remain calm in difficult situations
 samasyaon kaa samaadhaan shant rahakar hi safaltaapurvak dhundha ja saktaa he
 The scriptures have written about Lord Vishnu
 "shantakaaran bhujagashyann"
 Padmanabhan Suresham
 vishvadharan gagansadrushan meghavarnan shubhangam 
 This means Lord Vishnu is resting on Sheshnag in a calm manner
 bhagwaan vishnu ke is rup ko dekhakar man main ye prashn uthta he ki sarpon ke raja par baithkar koi itnaa shant kaise rah saktaa he? lekin wo to bhagwaan hai or unke liye sab kuch sambhav he
 Shri Vishnu has many other powers, which may surprise you
 bhagwaan vishnu ke 'narayan' naam kaa rahasy kya he?bhagwaan vishnu apane bhakton par har rup or har swaroop se krupa barasaate hai or isiilie wo jagat ke paalanhaar kehalaate hai
 But have you ever wondered why Lord Vishnu's name is Narayana? Why do his devotees call him Narayana? According to a legend, water is born from the feet of Lord Vishnu
 pani ko "nir" yaa "nar" bhi kaha jaataa he
 Lord Vishnu also resides in water
 isliye "nar" shabd se unka narayan naam padaa he
 This means that God resides in water
 isiilie bhagwaan vishnu ko unke bhakt 'narayan' naam se bulaate hai
 The mystery of the name "hari" of Lord Vishnu - Lord Vishnu is also called by the name "hari"
 hari kii utpatti har se hui he
 It is said that "hari Harati Paapani" which means Hari God removes all the problems and sins that come in our life
 isiilie bhagwaan vishnu ko hari bhi kaha jaataa he, kyonki sachche man se srihari kaa samaran karne waalon ko kabhi nidhasha nahin milti he
 Whatever be the trouble and trouble, Shrihari takes all the miseries
 bhagwaan vishnu ko prasann karne ke liye ye upaay karen-- guuruuvaar ke din snaan ke baad pilaa vastra dhaaran karen
 - Worship Lord Vishnu duly
 - puja main pile phulon kaa prayog karen
 - Light a lamp of ghee in front of Lord Vishnu
 - bhagwaan vishnu ke kisi bhi mantra kaa jaap karen

 Advocate Kapil Sibal, seeking release on humanitarian grounds, said that it is not proper for the court to keep Subrata Roy in jail even though the contempt process against him has not been completed
 sibbal ne kaha ki anya bade udyog gharaanon ko is tarah kii pareshaani nahin jhelni padati he or unke 1,000 karod rupee tak ke karj ko rigerv bank or bainkon dwaara 5 se 10 saal main bhugtan kii suvidha di jaati he

 paanch rajyon main farvari se shuru ho rahe vidhansabha chunaavon ko lekar chunaav ayog se jari nae circular ko lekar goa or punjab main asamanjas kii sthiti ban gai he
 Both these states are going to vote on February 4, for which the last date for filing nominations is January 18
 aise main ayog ke nae niyam se donon rajyon main ummidavaaron ke bich hadkamp machaa hua he
 In fact, there has been a ruckus with the new rule of the Commission, according to which people living in government houses will inform the Commission about the outstanding bills of water, electricity and telephone
 namakan bharne ke liye aise ummidavaaron ke no duj certificate dena anivaary hoga, lekin chunaav ayog ke circular main is baat kaa kahin spashtikaran nahin ki aakhir is niyam ke daayre main koun log aate hai
 The order of the High Court on which the Election Commission has implemented this rule was for politicians and government babus who used government facilities but did not pay
 unke durupyog kii khabaren baar-baar aane ke baad adaalat ne yah aadesh diya tha
 The Election Commission has issued a circular on the rule used in the elections of five states this year, but under this rule, no mention of what kind of candidates will be mandatory for giving no dues certificate
 aise main ummidavaar pareshaan hai ki ab namakan kii aakhri taarikh main mahaj 3 baaki hai, aise main asamanjas kii is sthiti se ummidavaaron ke saamne mushkil khadi ho gai he
 In Goa, the Election Officer has asked all candidates for no dues certificate for water, electricity and telephone
 naa sirf sarkari awaas main rahane vaale, balki gaiyr sarkari awaas main rahane vaale ummidavaaron ko bhi no duj certificate dene ko kaha ja rahaa he
 If sources are to be believed, the Chief Electoral Officer of Goa wrote a letter to the Election Commission asking for clear guidelines on the circular as soon as the complaint was received in the case
 sutron ke mutabik, goa or punjab donon hi rajyon ke chunaav adhikariyon ne circular ko lekar chunaav ayog ko likhaa he or chunaav ayog jald hi is niyam ko lekar spashtikaran jari kar saktaa he
 At the same time, the Aam Aadmi Party, which is contesting elections in Goa, has described it as a drawback of the Election Commission
 aap netaa ashutosh kii maane to unke kai ummidavaaron se namakan bharne ke dauraan no duj certificate maange gaye
 The AAP says that there are only three days left for the nomination date to expire, in such a situation that the nomination of candidates is canceled due to this circular
 chunaav ayog kii is laaparvaahee kaa khamiyaja ummidavaaron ko bhugatna padegaa
 On the other hand, if the office of the Chief Electoral Officer of Goa is to be believed, a single window system of giving no dues certificate is being made to protect all the candidates from inconvenience

 The Supreme Court ordered Yadav to be kept in jail, after finding the Bell found in Patna High Court
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne poocha ki kya yadav reeha he
 
 
 To this his lawyer replied no
 to supreme court ne kaha, abhi unhen jail main hi rahane do
 Earlier on Wednesday, in the hearing of the case, the Supreme Court said that this case is related to the minor with the rape and Poxo Act
 hamen ye bhi dekhnaa he ki is maamle main fere trial ho
 At the same time, Yadav said that till the trial is complete, he is ready to stay out of Bihar, bail should not be canceled
 bihar sarkaar ko is tarah hoicourt ke chif justise par aarope nahin lagaana chahie tha
 All such people will come to the Supreme Court accusing the judges
 yadav ke vakil ne kaha ki rajya sarkaar kii tamaam daleelein bebuniyaad hai
 If the accused is MLA then the state government cannot make such allegations
 rape ke saare aarope jhuthe hai or is aarope main kai jhol hai
 At the same time, it was said by the Bihar government that Yadav's bail should be canceled
 teen hafte pehle hoicourt ke jaj ne jamaanat dene se inkaar kiya tha, lekin iske baad chif justise ne jamaanat de di
 The comments supreme court ke yadav ko jail bhejne ke baad bhale hi peedita ke court main bayaan darj ho gaye, lekin ab bhi kai ahm gavaahon ke bayaan darj hone hai
 Yadav can influence the trial and witnesses in the case
 yahaan tak ki usne jail main bhi saare niyamon ko taak par rakh diya tha
 Explain that the Supreme Court is hearing the Bihar government's petition to cancel the bail granted to the suspended RJD MLA Rajaballabh Yadav from the Patna High Court
 pichhali sunwaayee main court ne rajballabh yadav ko sarender kar jail jane ke aadesh jari kiye the
 The court had said that Yadav will remain in jail till the victim's testimony is done
 court ne sarkaar ko kaha tha ki 2 hafte main peedita kaa trial court main bayaan darj karaaen
 In fact, the Supreme Court is hearing a petition seeking the cancellation of the bail of Rajaballabh Yadav, a 16-year-old minor accused of rape and Nawada of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)
 maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan court ne poocha ki kya yadav reeha he

 isse pehle buudhvaar ko maamle kii sunwaayee main supreme court ne kaha tha ki ye maamla naaballig ke saath rape or pokso act se judaa he
 We also have to see that there is a fair trial in this case
 vahiin yadav kii ore se kaha gaya ki jab tak trial puraa nahin hota, wo bihar se baahar rahane ko taiyaar hai, jamaanat radd na kii jaae
 The Bihar government should not have accused the Chief Justice of the High Court as such
 aise to sab log jajon par aarope lagaate hue supreme court aa jaaenge
 Yadav's lawyer said that all the arguments of the state government are baseless
 aaropee MLA he to isliye rajya sarkaar is tarah ke aarope nahin laga sakati
 All the allegations of rape are false and there are many lies in this charge
 vahiin, bihar sarkaar kii ore se kaha gaya ki yadav kii jamaanat radd kii jaani chahie
 Three weeks ago the High Court judge refused to grant bail, but after that the Chief Justice granted bail
 tippaniyan Even after the Supreme Court sent Yadav to jail, the statements of the victim were recorded in the court, but the statements of many important witnesses are yet to be recorded
 yadav is cese ke trial or gavaahon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Even in prison, he laid down all the rules
 bataa den ki RJD ke nilambit vidhayak rajballabh yadav ko patna hoicourt se mili jamaanat radd karne kii bihar sarkaar kii yachika par supreme court sunwaayee kar rahaa he
 In the last hearing, the court surrendered Rajaballabh Yadav and issued orders to go to jail
 court ne kaha tha jab tak peedita kii gavaahi na ho jaye tab tak yadav jail main rahenge

 oktober se disambar ke bich sirf 1 lakh 17 hazaar nai naukariyaan paidaa hui hai
 Whereas between April and June there were 1 lakh 82 thousand jobs

 Labor laws need to be debated separately, but Pangarhia says that the central and state governments have jointly enacted some 200 types of labor laws, due to which textile companies in India do not want to be big and big industrialists do not want to come in this sector
 bharat main is sector main 90 pratishat log choti companiyon main kaam karte hai jabaki china main 87 pratishat mazdoor majhole or badi companiyon main kaam karte hai
 Therefore, they are now warning the industry to invest in the field of job creation

 aajkal kii vyast jindagi main ham khud ke liye samay hi nahin nikaal pate hai
 We take the stress of every task and then fall prey to depression
 iske baad depressant se mukti paane ke liye tarah-tarah kii dawaaiyon kaa seven karte hai
 Let me tell you, instead of these medicines, if you spend only 15 minutes a day jogging or do some physical exercise, then you will not have the problem of depression
 aisa ham nahin, balki ek nai study kii report main bataaya gaya he
 Massachusetts General Hospital has done a study in which it has been found that the risk of depression will be reduced significantly if we are jogging for only 15 minutes
 agar jogging nahin, to kuch or shaareerik vyaayaam karnaa jaruri he
 The main researcher of this study, Dr
 david kehete hai ' jab bhi hamaare paas koi marij depressant kii shikaayat lekar aata he, ham unhen dawaai kii jagah thodaa tahalne, gardening karne ke liye prerit karte hai
 He also insisted that after 15 minutes of jogging or some other physical work, our heart should pump 50 percent faster
 david ise sweet spot kehete hai
 For example, if your heart rate was 60 before exercise, then it should be 90 after exercise
 aapako bataa den, 611,583 log is study kaa hissaa the
 Some of them were wearing accelerometers, while some were self-reporting their physical work
 is experiment se ye samaj main aayaa ki jin logon ne excelerometer pahane the or eksrasij bhi kii thi, uname depressant kaa khatra kam tha un logon ke tulana main jinhone excelerometer nahin pahane the
 It has also become clear from the study that your DNA has nothing to do with depression
 agar aapke mata pita ko depressant kii samasya he bhi, to iskaa matlab ye nahin ki aap bhi usase grasit ho jaaenge
 If you take care of your health and do 15 minutes of jogging or some other physical work, then you are less prone to depression
 jaankaree ke liye bataa den, depressant america, euke or bharat main ek pramukh samasya ke rup main ubhara he or isse kaaphi log peedit he
 More than 16 million people in the US alone suffer from depression

 The Supreme Court upheld the government's decision on the issue of his age, against the expectation of Army Chief General VK Singh
 supreme court ne kaha ki vah 10 may 1950 ko unki janmatithi sweekaar karne sambandhi apni patibaddhta ko asweekaar nahin kar sakate
 This led the army chief to withdraw his petition
 supreme court ne kaha ki vah general singh kii yachika par sunwaayee ke paksh main nahin he
 The petition said that his date of birth should be considered as 10 May 1951 in government documents
 sheersh nyaayalay ne unhen yachika waapas lene kaa vikalp diya
 The court ruled that no prejudice has been made against General Singh and the government's decision regarding his date of birth will remain in effect
 is mat ke maddenjar general singh ko ab is saal 31 may ko sevanivrutt hona padegaa
 The apex court noted that the government has full faith in him and the court wants to ensure that he continues to act like the army chief as he is doing now
 khachaakhach bhare adalati kaksh main do ghante tak chali sunwaayee main sheersh nyaayalay ne kaha ki general singh ko apni us patibaddhta or 2008 evam 2009 main likhe apane un patron kaa sammaan rakhana chahie or 10 may 1950 ko apni janmatithi sweekaar kerani chahie
 When the court hearing resumed at two in the afternoon after the lunch break, General Singh finally withdrew his petition
 isse pehle sunwaayee shuru hone ke samay atarni general ji i vaahnavati ne nyaayalay ko suchit kiya ki sarkaar ne apane 30 disambar 2011 ke us aadesh ko waapas le liya he jisamen general singh kii aayu mudde par vaidhanik shikaayat ko khaarij kar diya gaya tha
 With this, Vahanvati made it clear that the government is firm on its decision taken in July last year that her date of birth is 10 May 1950
 nyaayamurti aar em lodha kii adhyakshata vaali peeth ne general singh ke samaksh isko lekar kade sawaal kiye ki unhone dastavejon ko durust kyon nahin karavaaya
 The apex court said that the Army's identification of his birth date on 10 May 1950 was neither a perversion nor a major error
 peeth ne kaha ki jab general singh bhartiya sainya ekademy or rashtriya raksha academy main shaamil hue to jin dastaavjon main unki janmatithi 10 may 1950 thi, vah unki pahunch main the
 Supreme Court bench also included Justice HL Gokhale
 peeth ne general singh se kaha ki sarkaar ke nirnay kaa paalan karne ke bare main patibaddhta jataaye jane ke baad or aashwaasan diye jane ke pashchaat vah ise asweekaar nahin kar sakate
 He said that the government has full faith in him as the army chief and there is no prejudice towards him
 saath hi peeth ne is baat kii ore unka dhyaan dilaayaa ki sena pramukh ke rup main general singh us sheersh pad par pahunch gayi jisaki kisi bhi sainya adhikari ko aakanksha rahati he
 The apex court also pointed out that General Singh's writ petition was not for determining the date of birth but for identifying his date of birth in government documents
 sena pramukh ko is baat ko lekar or niraash hui jab nyaayalay ne unke is anurodh ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya ki 10 may 1950 kii unki janmatithi sambandhi sarkaar kaa aadesh keval sena ke ricard tak hi simit rahe
 After General Singh withdrew his petition, the court declared him disposed of
 isse purv vaahnavati ne yah spasht kar diya ki sarkaar apane 21 evam 22 july ke aadesh par atal he jisamen general singh ke 1951 ko apana janmavarsh bataaye jane ke daawey ko khaarij kar diya gaya tha
 He told the apex court that the government and the defense minister have full faith in General Singh in leading the army
 nyaayalay se nikalne ke baad sena pramukh ke vakil punit bali ne kaha ki yah donon pakshon kii vijay thi kyonki maamle kaa sweekaarya dhang se samaadhaan nikaal liya gaya
 He told reporters that our petition was not for extension of service (of General Singh) but it was a matter of respect and honesty of the General
 unhone kaha ki hamen is baat kaa santosh he ki unke sammaan or eemaandaaree ko behaal rakhaa gaya he

 pati kii maut ho jane ke baad mili kuli kii naukrilakshmi bhopal stesan par karti he rojaanaa nite shifthausalon kii kai kahaniyaan aapane dekhi or suni hogi lekin bhopal kii rahane vaali lakshmi kii kahani sangharsh kii aisi dastaan he, jise dekhakar har koi unke hausale kii daad de rahaa he
 We are talking about the first woman from Bhopal, Kuli Lakshmi, who chose the profession of a porter who is usually dominated by men, to feed her family and bear the future of children
 darasal, lakshmi kii shaadi bhopal railway stesan par kaam karne vaale kuli rakesh se hui thi
 After the husband's death, Lakshmi was given the job of coolie by the railway authorities as per rules
 jahaan lakshmi kii pahchaan bana billaa number 13
 Wearing the same badge number 13, Lakshmi performs night shifts daily at Bhopal railway station
 kuli kaa kaam karne se hone vaali kamai se lakshmi apane ghar kaa kharchaa bhi chalaati he or bacchon kii shiksha se lekar unki parvarish bhi karti he
 However, Lakshmi feels that she is not earning enough to provide good education to her child
 haalanki uskaa kahana he ki sarkari skool main bhi acchhee shiksha aajkal milane lagi he to usko is baat kaa bharosa he ki uske bachche kaa bhavishya ujjwal hoga
 Let me tell you that Lakshmi works daily in night shift and completes the necessary household chores during the day
 lakshmi kareeb 6 ghante kaam karti he
 Usually Lakshmi starts her duty from 6 pm but sometimes has to do duty till late night because the commuters of the Rajdhani and premium trains get a decent amount of money at night
 rojaanaa hoti he itani kamailakshmi ke mutabik biimaar hone par bhi wo kaam karne aati he lekin is baat kaa dhyaan rakhti he ki zyada kaam na karke wo jaldi ghar chali jaae taaki tabiyat par zyada asar na pade kyonki roj rupee kamaane ke liye jaruri he ki sehat saath de
 According to Lakshmi, she normally earns up to Rs 300-400 a day, but there are times when her earnings are barely Rs 100-200
 vahiin mahila ko kuli kaa kaam karte dekh log prabhavit to hote hai lekin aisa nahin he ki har koi lakshmi se saamaan hi uthvaata ho
 Laxmi told that many times people try to help her in this way but she refuses them
 haalanki kai baar log usko saamaan uthavane ke saath-saath bataur inaam zyada rupee de dete hai, jisase lakshmi ko madad mil jaati he
 Different types of electoral colors are seen in Gujarat
 somvaar ko rajya ke mukhyamantri vijay roopaani skuti par baithkar rajkot pashchim seat se parchaa daakhil karne pahunche to sabhi dekhakar hairaan rah gaye
 The reason is also because if the CM of Gujarat, called the most developed state in the country, could not arrange a four-wheeler on the day of his nomination, then it was enough to surprise
 karodpati hai roopanibat yahaan khatm nahin hoti, namakan ke dauraan die halafname main sabit hua ki roopaani 9
 He owns property worth 08 crores and owns an Innova car and wife owns a Maruti Wagon r car
 logon ko roopaani ke skuti par savaar ho parchaa bharne kii vajah samaj nahin ai
 The first reason for this is that he is trying to show himself to be normal and connected with the public in the election and that is why, like a common citizen, he started to fill the form without any Lashkar riding on Scooty
 rajkot ke dhankuberrajkot pashchim seat kaa ganit bhi roopaani kii is kadam ko bataane kii duusari vajah he
 The candidate the Congress has fielded against Rupani from Rajkot is the second richest candidate in the state
 isi seat se congress ke indranil rajyaguru chunaav lard rahe hai jinhone halafname main apni sampatti 141
 22 crore has been told
 unke paaskai lagjri gaadiyaan hanore kai vyavsaayik pratishthanon kii maalik hai
 According to the information, Indranil collects a lot of money for the Congress party
 yahi vajah he kidhanbal ke sahareunhone rajkot purv kii apni surakshit seat chhodkar pashchim se roopaani ke khilaaf chunaav main utarane kaa faisla liya
 It is also being told that Indranil has bought up to all the publicity hoardings in the area, in such a situation, it is not possible for Rupani to face him in terms of money and crowd
 keshubhai se ummidilake main indranil kii pakad se mukhyamantri vijay roopaani kii mushkilen badhati najar aa rahi hai
 For this reason, Rupani has also met Keshubhai Patel
 keshubhai patel kaa rajkot se purana rishta rahaa he or vijay roopaani ko ummid he ki keshubhai chunaav main unke liye prachaar karenge
 So when CM Rupani could not compete with Indranil in the power of money, then he went and brought his image of common man to the public, so that this image can be benefited in the election and CM can succeed in saving his seat

 He started his school 13 years ago with just two children
 sharma ko khud garibi ke kaaran apni padhai bich main chhodani padi thi
 He is still sad about this
 isliye jab yamuna bank ilaake main ghoomte hue unhone bacchon ko bina shiksha ke bhatakate dekha to unke madhyam se apane sapane ko jeene kaa faisla kiya
 Sharma (49) runs his school in two shifts

 For girls from 2 pm to 4:30 pm, in which there are 180 girls

 People around also help them
 ve apane khaali samay main aakar bacchon ko padhaate hai, unke saath saat aise shikshak sthai rup se jude hue hai
 By the way, the school is far from the noise of the road, and the children do not even feel the sound of the metro train coming every five minutes
 ve to apane simit sansadhano vaale skool main khush hai
 They do not mind that they sit by laying sacks on the ground and they have only five blackboards in the name of goods

 haa shuruyaat main kuch enjio zarur aae the, lekin unamem se koi sahi nahin laga
 Those people used to say something and do something else
 unhen bacchon kii madad karne se nahin balki unke jariye paise kamaane se matlab tha
 He says that we only get some help from people around
 vah bhi dhan yaa skool ke saamaan ke rup main nahin
 People come here to distribute food, sometimes the youth come to celebrate their birthday
 skool main padhane vaale bacchon ke chehron par khushiyaan laane ke liye yah kaaphi hota he
 They also feel that even though they are poor, they do not have houses and vehicles, but they are also part of the society

 Social media may have been started to deepen the friendship and mutual relations, but over time, the practice of promoting business through it has also started
 agar aap bhi apane brands kaa vigyaapan fasebuk jaise websiton par karnaa chaahate hai to lakhon 'like' dilaane vaale prastaavon ke prati satark ho jaaie
 According to reputed business magazine Forbes, Facebook is running a campaign against institutions that lure in fake fake ads

 Facebook engineer Matt Jones wrote in a blog post, "spam message carriers proposing fake likes have only one objective, to make a profit from someone else's page
 ' unhone likhaa, 'aise log like dilaane kaa jhootha vaada karte hai, jabaki upabhokta ko pataa nahin hota ki farji 'like' se unke pej yaa unke uptadak kaa prachaar nahin hota or na hi logon tak unki pahunch ban paati he

 The speculation of a possible alliance between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections was rejected by Delhi Pradesh Congress President Ajay Maken
 unhone kaha ki anna andolan ke jariye ‘modi ko khadaa karne vaale’ kejariwal ke saath haath milaane kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 Maken also claimed on Saturday that the public is now rejecting Kejriwal and wants to bring back the Congress in Delhi
 unhone kaha, ‘dilli ke congress kaaryakarta or sabhi netaa yah bilkul nahin chaahate ki kejariwal kii party ke saath kisi tarah kaa gathbandhan ho
 There are some reasons for this
 pehali vajah yah he ki kejariwal keelokapriyata main lagaataar giravata rahi he or janata ab unako nakaar chuki he
 'the second reason,' Maken said, is that in 2011, Kejriwal, along with Baba Ramdev, Kiran Bedi, RSS and BJP, damaged the Congress and stood up to Modi
 aise main kejariwal ke saath gathbandhan kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta he
 Congress leader Maken said that the Aam Aadmi Party had received 56 per cent of the votes in the assembly elections and only 26 per cent of the votes in the municipal elections
 duusari taraf congress kaa vot 9 fisadi se badhkar 22 fisadi par pahunch gaya he
 He said that the graph of Congress is continuously increasing

 No message was received at that time

 After the confrontation between the protesting students and the police force at Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act, many photos and videos are being shared widely on social media
 unamem se ek photo kii sabase zyada charchaa he
 Through this photo and video, it is being claimed that during the protest, ABVP students along with Delhi Police are beating the protesters
 is daawey ko hawa isliye mil rahi he, kyonki photo main genes or tii-shart ke saath police kii suraksha kavach or helmet pahana hua ek aadmi pulicekarmiyon ke saath khadaa dikh rahaa he
 With this, in the video that is going viral, a man is seen abusing and beating people
 gaali-galouj hone ke kaaran ham video yahaan post nahin kar rahe hai
 It is being said that this man is not actually from the police but Bharat Sharma, an activist of ABVP, the student organization of the RSS, who along with the police is beating the protesters, because the police never do duty in jeans-t-shirt
 soshal media par jo post share ho rahe hai unamem bharat sharma naam ke ek abivipi chaatr netaa kii fasebuk profile kaa screenshot bhi maujuud he
 By combining these pictures, videos and screenshots of Facebook, many similar claims are very much discussed

 It came to know that there is a mix of truth and lies in the things being said
 asal main hakeekat ye he
 Who is Bharat Sharma? It is being claimed through a screenshot of Facebook that this man is Bharat Sharma, a student leader of ABVP
 isliye hamane sabase pehle screenshot main dikh rahi jaankaree ke aadhaar par bharat sharma kaa fasebuk profile khojane kii koshish kii
 It turned out that Facebook profile is no longer present
 lekin fasebuk screenshot main di gai jaankaree ke aadhaar par jab hamane abivipi ke kuch kaaryakartaaon se sampark kiya to hamen bharat sharma kaa phone number mil gaya
 Bharat told us that he is a student of the Faculty of Law College of Delhi University and has also joined ABVP
 bharat ne mana ki is video main ek aadmi ko laat maarthe or gusse main gaali vahi de rahe hai
 But they say that this video is being cut and it does not tell the whole truth
 bharat ke mutabik, 16 disambar ko dopaher 12 baje ke kareeb dilli uniwarsity ke faikalti of soshal sciences ke paas baahar se aae kuch pradarshnkaree chaatro ko college main jane se roak rahe the
 He clashed with the protesters when he opposed it
 ye usee samay kaa video he, lekin isamen sirf unhen marpet karata dikhaaya gaya he or isse pehle pradarshnakariyon kii gaali-galouj ko kaat kar hataa diya gaya he
 We asked him for a video showing the whole truth, but he could not provide us the full video until the report was written, but Bharat Sharma categorically denied that the person wearing the red T-shirt and police safety armor and helmet in the photo It is visible that they are also the same
 unhone kaha ki naa to wo is photo main hai or naa hi unhen iske bare main kuch pataa he
 He also sent a photo of himself to prove his point, saying that the person wearing a police jacket does not get his face
 bharat sharma kaa fasebuk pej kyon hua gaayab?lekin bharat sharma kaa fasebuk pej band kaise ho gaya? is bare main bharat ne hamen bataaya ki unki khabar jab viral hone lagi to fasebuk par log unhen dhamkiyaan or bhaddi gaaliyaan dene lagen
 The extent was reached when people took photographs of his family members from his Facebook profile and also shared them with threatening and lewd messages
 isliye unhone somvaar kii raat ko apana phezbuk profile diactevet kar diya
 Who is the police guard jacket with jeans-t shirt? It is clear from seeing this photo that this person is standing comfortably with the rest of the policemen

 While the parties continue to be drawn over the MCD elections, after a long time, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has finally taken on the Congress
 aakhir kyon har mudde par desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi or bijepi par apane bayanon se hamalaa karne vaale kejariwal ne achaanak congress kii ore nishaanaa mode diya he
 In the first session of the Delhi Assembly, Kejriwal, who usually lashed out at the BJP, remembered the Congress and heard the Congress fiercely
 dilli ke mukhyamantri ne ek baar phir bijli kaa mudda uthaate hue congress ko aade haathon liya
 Arvind Kejriwal accused the Congress of saving the power companies, saying that former Chief Minister Sheila Dixit had lied about the audit of the electricity companies from the CAG but as soon as the Aam Aadmi Party government was formed, the first power companies were audited by the CAG in which a scam of 8000 crores was found
 kejariwal ne aage yah bhi kaha ki, dilli vidhansabha kaa chunaav haarane ke baad bhi congress bijli companiyon ke bachaane main lagi he
 While the Delhi government reduced the electricity rates by half, if the report is implemented, the electricity rates may be reduced but the power companies went to the High Court and the court rejected them
 philhal ye maamla supreme court main he to vahiin congress ne apane teen bade vakeelon ko bijli companiyon ko bachaane kaa jimmaa diya he
 Abhishek Manu Singhvi, p Chidharambam and Kapil Sibal are defending them
 unhone kaha pehle congress ne dilli ko 15 saal lutaa or haarane ke baad bhi bijli companiyon ke bachaane main juty he
 The case of power companies is quite old, but the issue has come out for targeting the Congress as soon as the MCD elections are called
 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main dilli main congress kaa supada saaf ho gaya tha lekin emsidi chunaav main congress kaa palada baari padataa najar aa rahaa he
 Even after the BJP lost the elections in the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, there was no decrease in the vote percentage whereas the Congress vote percentage saw a significant decline
 lekin dilli main 2016 main hue emsidi upachunaav main congress ne 13 main se 5 siten jeet kar jabardast vaapasi kii thi
 Whereas the Aam Aadmi Party, which won 67 out of 70 seats a year ago, got the same number i
e
 5 seats, which was a setback for the Aam Aadmi Party
 darasal, jhuggi-jhopadi or bahari dilli main rahane vaale log or anaadhikrut coloniyon ke log congress ke paramparaagat voters rahe hai
 But in the 2015 assembly elections, these voters shifted to the Aam Aadmi Party, which benefited AAP
 lekin emsidi upachunaav main congress ko mili jeet or ab congress kii taiyaariyon ne aam aadmi party ko majaboor kar diya he
 After which Arvind Kejriwal is directly targeting the Congress
 bijepi10 saal se satta par kabiz he
 Which itself is struggling with anti-encumbency factor
 aap sarkaar bhi do saalon se satta main he
 The Congress has been pushing for the Eidi Peak to bring back its traditional voters for the MCD election
 yahkejariwal ke liye khatraahe
 For this reason, the Aam Aadmi Party is now targeting the Congress by raising the old allegations in a new way
