 agast kii 28 taarikh ko jab puraa gwalior janmashtami manaane kii taiyaari main tha, usee din arun agrrwal kaa 11 varshiya putr kushagrar shaam ke samay koching jane ke dauraan gaayab ho gaya
 Agarwal, a resident of Harpalpur and petrol pump owner near Chhatarpur district, sent Kushagra to Gwalior to his brother's house in July this year itself for studies
 kushagra ke gaayab hone par uske parijan pareshaan ho gaye
 The police launched the investigation and initially considered him missing, rather than kidnapped
 samay nikalataa ja rahaa tha or parijanon kii saans ataki hui thi
 Therefore, Agarwal himself started searching for his son Kushagra
 kushagra ke parijanon kaa bharosa police se uthta ja rahaa tha
 Two days ago, an engineering student Ravindra Narwaria was kidnapped from Gwalior and his corpse was recovered on 28 August
 uske parijanon se dedh karod ru
 a ransom was demanded
 phiroti milane main deree hone par aparankartaaon ne gwalior ke najadik ke panihaar ke jangal main ravindra kii hatya kar di
 The family of Kushagra got frightened by this incident
 idhar aparankartaaon ne kushagra ke pita arun agarwal se rihaai ke evaj main 25 lakh ru
 Asked
 yah soochna police ko bhi mil gai
 Keeping in mind that the crooks should not harm the crooks, Agarwal started contacting the crooks
 police ko shaq tha ki is apharan main peshewar aparankartaaon kaa giroh shaamil he
 Therefore, the police wanted to first decide that there was no threat to the life of Kushagra, because the credit of the police was discounted by the killing of Ravindra earlier
 iske alaava 7 sitambar ko gwalior main mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii jan-aashirwad yatra thi or yah maamla tool pakad saktaa tha
 Finally, 10 days after the kidnapping, in Malatera near Datia, when the miscreants were leaving Kushagra in exchange for a ransom, the police nabbed the miscreants named Ashoka, Rajbahadur
 kushagra kaa apharan shaatir suraj ahirwar ne apane saathiyon ke saath milakar kiya tha
 In this, two youths, Vipin and Gandharva, who lived in the neighborhood of Kushagra, supported him
 ab ye donon yuvak hiraasat main bhej die gaye hai, lekin mukhya aaropee suraj abhi pakadaa nahin gaya he
 Suraj is mainly active from Jhansi to Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh and is accused in several kidnapping cases
 yahaan ke pravasi chaatr badmaashon ke nishane par lambey samay se bane hue hai
 Earlier some gangs in Rajasthan used to kidnap through their network of local miscreants
 ab uttar pradesh kii seemaa ke aasapaas apharan karne vaale badmaash sakriy ho gaye hai
 How serious the situation is becoming, it can be gauged that from the beginning of this year to the month of August, about 100 cases of kidnapping have been reported in Gwalior alone
 farvari main 12 varshiya akaash pachori kaa or march main dilli nivasee guruvachan singh ke dhai varshiya bete amritpal kaa apharan hua
 Engineering student Prankul was killed in April after being kidnapped

 Sanad Yadav, a public school teacher, says, "students have started coming to Gwalior for coaching in many subjects including engineering, medical and chartered accountants
 unki suraksha bada masalaa he
 The police should make the surveillance system work
 ''apharan ke zyaadaatar maamalon main parijan phiroti dekar hi apahrit ko chhudaate hai or police par laaparvaahee kaa aarope lagata he
 But police officers do not believe so
 gwalior ke police adheekshak santosh kumaar singh bataate hai, ''zyaadaatar apharan aasapaas rahane waalon ke sahyog se hi hote hai
 The same happened in the case of Kushagra and the neighboring tenants committed the crime after knowing the whole family situation
 aise main yah jaruri ho gaya he ki makaan maalik apane kirayedar kii puri jaankaree den
 This makes it easier to catch miscreants
 zyaadaatar maamalon main badmaashon ne kiraye kaa makaan lekar hi apharan kii vaardaat ko anjaam diya he
 "while Gwalior has emerged as a major center of education, the hijacking is becoming a cottage industry due to lack of industry and employment opportunities
" aise main pados ke jilon se aane vaale students kii suraksha chintaa kaa sabab ban gai he
 The local police administration is responsible for addressing this concern

 In an interview to Pierce Morgan, Ronaldo said, "we were hungry
" mcdonald hamaare stadium ke baahar tha
 We knocked on the door and asked if there was any burger left? Idina and those two girls were incredible
 maine unako phir kabhi nahin dekha
 i asked many people in Portugal to try to find them
 main unhen nahin dhund paaya
 'ronaldo said that those girls had stopped mcdonald's
 lekin mujhe ummid he ki is intervyuu se unhen dhundne main madad milegi
 i want to invite them to my house and invite them to dinner with me
 main unhen isliye dhundhna chahta hum kyonki main unhen kuch lautaanaa chahta hum
 i can never forget that time

 If the burgers survived, our manager would have allowed us to give them to the boys
 ' unhone kaha, 'ek ladke kaa naam christiano ronaldo tha jo sabase zyada aata tha

 'howdy Modi main donald trump bole, 'america or bharat ke liye mahatvapurn he seemaa suraksha'unhone kaha, 'main ab bhi is baat par hansatii hum
 i have told my son about this too but he feels that i am lying because he cannot even imagine that his gentleman had ever given a burger to Cristiano Ronaldo
 'unhone kaha, 'agar vah(ronaldo) unhen dinar par bulaayenge to main nishchit jaaoongi
 First i will call him Thakyu and then we will remember those moments
 ' Kaise na ho gujara

 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri ummidavaar ke rup main pesh kiya ja rahaa shaks agar satta main aayaa to bharat barbaad ho jayega
 On Modi's accusation that she is doing vote bank politics and ignoring the non-bengalis and welcoming the Bangladeshis with open arms, Mamta said that she is not aware of history

 inhen vipaksh ke paas bhi nahin janaa chahie kyonki inamen bhi bahut log honge jo vipaksh kaa mazaaq udaate rahe honge

 Film Name: Toilet - Ek Prem kathadirector: Shri Narayan Singh Star Cast: Akshay Kumar, Bhumi Pednekar, Sudhir Pandey, Divyendu Sharma Duration: 2 hours 41 minutes Certificates: u / a Rating: 2
 5 starpichley kuch varshon se abhinaytrakshay kumarabaiopic yaa asal muddon par aadhaarit filmon kaa hissaa banate dikhaai de rahe hai
 His films like Airlift, Rustom, Baby, Jolly LLB 2 have given the audience a habit of going to theaters
 or abaki baar gaanv main ahm mudde 'toilet' par akshay ne sabakaa dhyaan aakarshith karne kii baat kahi he
 The film has been directed by Srinarayan Singh, who has edited films like MS Dhoni, Special Chhabis, Baby and a Wednesday
 to akshay kumaar or shri narayan singh ne kaisaa kaam kiya he- aaie jaanate hai:kai gharon se judi he kahaneeyah kahani mathura shahar ke paas ke ek gaanv ke rahane vaale keshav (akshay kumaar) kii he jo ek mangalik ladkaa he
 Because of this, despite being 36 years old, she is not getting married
 pehle uski shaadi ek bhens (mallika) se karai jaati he
 Keshav owns a bicycle shop and one day when he goes to Jaya (bhumi Pednekar) house to do a bicycle delivery, he falls in love and then gets married
 lekin kahani tab shuru hoti he jab shaadi ke baad jaya sasuraal aati he or pataa chalata he ki ghar main shauchalay nahin he
 She flatly refuses to stay in such a house, and then many stereotypes emerge, and different characters in the story take their characters forward, taking the story forward
 in baton par hogi toilet ek prem katha kii tarif- film kaa diarection, cinemetography, lokation badhiya hai
 The shoots of the village's real locations look amazing
 akshayaki pahani nakli branded tisharts real or phani lagati hai
 - In the film, an attempt has been made to show the issue of 'open defecation' which usually starts from the second half
 interval se pehle keshav or jaya ke pyaar par focus karne vaali kahani darshai gai he
 - Many of the film's dialogues influence
 jaise- jab tak samasya nijee naa ho koun lade, koun hal nikaale yaa tumhaari ladaai sabhyataa se he aadi
 Also, under the government's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, what are the rules and regulations in the village have also been told
 -akshay kumaraka abhinay umdaa or saraahneey he
 The character is portrayed well
 vahin bhoomi pednekar ne bhi sahaj kaam kiya he
 Sudheer Pandey and Divyendu with the Panchnama of love surprise you
 baaki sah kalakaaron ne bhi film ke lihaaj se hi acting kii he
 The monologue of Akshay Kumar and Bhumi Pednekar is amazing, which also compels thinking
 lambii film main kamjor sangeet film kii ye baat khatkati he ki isaki lambaai bahut zyada he or isaki editing par kaam jarur kiya janaa chahie tha
 Where the first half is working, the story seems quite drawn in the second half as well
 diarector hone se pehle shrinarayan ne airlift, rustam, baby, jolly elelbi 2 jaisi filmein edit kii he
 This time too, he should have used his skills well
 jahaan tak film ke sangeet kii baat he to ye ausat he
 The song with a lot of beat sounds like something
 thodi foohadataa bhi dikhti haveheen film main kahin-kahin foohadataa bhi najar aati he jaise akshay kaa samvaad he ki aurat dhoti he kya, jo main use sanbhaaluun, yaa bhabhi jawan ho gai doodh kii dukaan ho gai aadi
 These seem to be forced dialogs
 toiletpar scam or naa banavaane ke kaaran bhi darshaae gaye hai, lekin koi bhi aisi baat nahin he jo sidhe dil main ghar kar jaae
 At the same time, neither the romance nor the issue is discussed in the film
 sab ghalmail sa ho gaya he
 The budget of box office film is about 18 crores and it is being said that Akshay has not taken his fees but he is going to share the profit
 film main bhi kai brands ko pramot kiya gaya he
 The film will be released in over 3200 screens
 or mudda aisa he ki bade weekend kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 The film's recovery cost is 105 crores with all the figures
 yani 110-115 karod kii kamai par hi ye hit kehalaaegi or 140 karod kii kamai par super hit
 However, given the way Bollywood movies are flopping in the past few years, it is also important to earn a toilet a love story

 On Monday, the entire government along with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sat on a dharna at the residence of Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal
 aap kii maang he ki tender kii prakriya ho jane ke baad alji ne adnga daalane ke liye ek cameti bana di jabaki pehle bhi rajdhani main camere lage par kabhi cameti nahin bani
 Speaking to India Today, Aam Aadmi Party's chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said that the party would not bow down to the demand to cancel the formation of the committee

 The BJP does not want the installation of cameras completed on time

 chhattisgarh se aa rahe rujhaanon main bhartiya janata party kaa supada saaf hota dikh rahaa he
 Out of 90 seats, Congress is leading in 58 seats and BJP has been reduced to just 23 seats
 jabaki pichhali baar bijepi 50 paar thi
 There are many reasons behind this major defeat of BJP in Chhattisgarh, read on which fronts BJP has failed this time
 1
 Anti-incumbency against Raman Singh The Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been running the government in the state since 2003, had to face anti-incumbency in the state this time
 chunaav se pehle hi raman singh ke khilaaf maahaul dikh rahaa tha, jiskaa rukh agsit pole ne bhi dikhaaya tha
 However, no one expected that Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh, a BJP stronghold, would be clean like this
 paanch rajyon ke nattejey yahaan padhein
 
 
 2
 kisaanon kii naarazgiraman singh bhale hi rajya main chaaval vaale baba ke naam se mashhoor hon, lekin kisaanon kii naaraazgi un par is baar baari padi he
 Anger among the farmers came out against Raman Singh government
 kisaan lagaataar fasalon ke daam ko lekar bijepi ke khilaaf pradarshan karata aayaa he, jiskaa jabardast nuksaan chunaav main bhartiya janata party ko uthaanaa padaa
 3
 chal gaya karjamaafee kaa masterstrokerajya main kisanraman singhki sarkaar se naaraaz tha
 The Congress took full advantage of this
 congress ke ghoshnaptr main kiya gaya kisaanon kii karjamaafee ke vaayade ne masterstroke kii tarah kaam kiya
 This has been the reason that the Congress wave was seen in the entire state
 4
 Failure on Naxalism The major reason for Singh's defeat was the failure of Naxalism this time
 naksalwadi kshetron main lagaataar hamale hote gaye or is baar in kshetron main banpar matdaan bhi hua
 The results clearly show that this bumper voting was against Raman Singh's government
 naksalwadi kshetron main baxur, dantewada jaisi siten aati hai

 6 fisadi voter dalit hai, yani rajya kii satta kii chaabi unke paas hi he
 In the trends that have come so far, the BJP is seen getting badly defeated in the Dalit-tribal dominated areas

 *** In Bihar, the impact of the death of more than one and a half hundred children due to chlamydia fever was to be seen on the budget as well, if the Prime Minister expressed grief over the death of these children, then the Finance Minister had a chance to save the children
 By making more provision of the budget, she would assure this country that now the death of children in this country will be stopped, the crimes against children will be reduced and in the public education system By adding more power, it will be made so strong that even the children standing in the last row can dream of a better future
 desh ko pehali baar ek mahila vitt mantri sambodhit kar rahi thim isliye unase ummid or bhi badi thi, lekin bajet book ko padhate hue bacchon ke liye bajet kshetra ko dekha to paaya ki yah to pichley das saal main sabase kam praavdhaan he
 In the last ten years, the country has seen the governments of two major parties, saying that it is disheartening to say that the vision of inclusion of children in the budget as a priority is missing in both places, even more disappointing in the last five years
 jab ham bacchon ke liye khaas bajet kii baat karte hai to uskaa matlab kya he? uskaa matlab do darjan se adhik vibhaagon se judi un 89 yojanaon se he jo sidhe taur par desh kii chalis pratishat aabaadi yani bacchon se jaakar judati he
 The good thing is that it is seen separately, that is, a complete document is based on schemes related to the welfare of children
 baari bahumat lekar sansad pahunchi bijepi sarkaar ne 5 july ko jo bajet pesh kiya usamen chalis pratishat aabaadi yani bacchon kaa hissaa keval 3
 29 percent
 bharat ke kul 27,86,349 karod rupee ke bajet main se 91,644
 Rs 29 crore has been allocated for child welfare
 gaur kijiyeg yah das saal pehle yani 2009-10 main manmohan singh kii sarkaar ke vittamantri pi
 About 0 from the budget presented by Chidambaram
 37 pratishat kam he
 Does the government think that the situation of children in the country is good, or is it not their intention to invest for children? manmohan singh kii sarkaar ne baad main is bajet ko badhaayaa bhi, 2012-13 main yah sarvaadhik 5
 04 percent, but since then it has been continuously decreasing and now it is the lowest in ten years, will we make the same provision for children in New India? The basic need of the country is education
 shiksha jitani acchhee milegi naagarik bhi utane hi behatar honge or yah behatar naagarik aage apana desh banaaenge, isliye shiksha par aavantit rakam desh par bhaar nahin he, vah nivesh he, ek behatar raashtra ke nirmaan ke liye nivesh se dar kaisaa? ham apane parivaar ke bacchon par nivesh karne main darate hai, nahin na, phir aakhir desh ke bacchon ke saath kanjusee kyon?vah bhi aise daur main jabaki tamaam maanak or raajnneetik-aarthik paridrishya or vaishvik, bazaarvaadi nitiyaan kaa banaaya jaal yah maang karata ho ki saarvajanik kshetra par to zyada se zyada kharch karke unhen behatar banaaya hi jayega
 In this case budget allocation will again tease you
 das saal pehle bacchon ke liye aavantit kul bajet kaa takreeban 83 pratishat hissaa shiksha or haashiye ke bacchon par kharch kiya ja rahaa tha, ab yah rakam takreeban 67
 Has come down to 6 percent, reduced the investment of about 16 percent on the most important sector like education
 kya das saal pehle kaa desh shiksha ke liye adhik samvedansheel tha, sochiega or sawaal kijiega ki bacchon ke sabase mahatvapurn kshetra par hamane yah kanjusee bharaa vyavhaar kyon kiya, kya hamane yah manshaa dikhaakar nijeekaran ke raaston ko or nahin khol diya he, kya yah sabakaa saath or sabakaa vikaas kii avadharana ke anukool kiya gaya vyavhaar he or kya isse haashiye ke un bacchon kaa bhala hoga, jo antyoday kii shrenee main aate hai, or gandhi 150 kaa zikr karte hue iske bare main vittamantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha bhi
 How can we justify his point that Antyodaya is at the center of every scheme? Between 2008 and 2015, about one crore 11 lakh five years old children have died
 diaria, malaria, nimonia jaisi bimaariyaan lakhon bacchon ko samay se pehle maar rahi hai
 In this situation, it is very important to spend on the health of children, to fix the health standards, because the effect of better health of children is also visible on the country
 par sarkaar bacchon ke maamalon main kyon gambhirtha nahin dikhaa paa rahi he?das saal paley 2010-11 main swasthya bacchon ke kul bajet aavanton kaa 4
 The 4 percent share was invested, the highest percentage in the last ten years
 iske baad keval ek saal 2017-18 main yah 4
 2 percent, but this year it has come down to three and a half percent
 is saal sarkaar ne bacchon ke swasthya par 3218
 33 crore has been provisioned
 behatar swasthya tabhi hoga, jab behatar poshan mili
 The National Family Health Survey-4 states that there are about 35 in the country
 8 pratishat bachche ab bhi kuposhan kaa shikaar hai
 Infant mortality and child mortality in India are still higher than other countries
 aise main yah anganwari sevaayen mahatvapurn ho jaati hai
 There needs to be a strengthening of the National Nutrition Mission
 das saalon ke aankade bataate hai ki aisidies or enenem par bal kalyaan ko aanvatit bajet main sabase adhik 26
 7 percent of the amount was allocated in 2015-16
 das saal pehle yah aavanton kul bacchon ke liye bajet kaa 20
 Was 6 percent
 vittamantri ne is saal ke liye is par 21
 2% of the amount spent, it is less than last year
 yadi in bajet praavdhaanon ke bich phir kahin bihar jaisi ghatnaayen saamne aaen to khud se or sarkaar se puuchhiyegaa ki hamane bacchon ko bachane ke liye kya kiya? UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, while condoling the demise of the 23-year-old girl student of the gang rape, has urged India to take corrective measures to deal with such crimes and punish the culprits severely

 In this way, you must have seen many temples of Mahadev, you have also seen many forms of them
 jaraa sochie agar mandir kaa aakaar hi mahadev kii mahima sunaae or mandir main pravesh karte hi mahadev kii shakti kaa andaja ho jaae to bhala isse zyada saubhaahgya kii kya baat hogi
 Kolar district of Karnataka has the world's highest Shivalinga, around which the Karon Shivalinga around it tells the unique story of devotion of their devotees to Shiva
 paavan, sundar or shant prakruti ke hariyaale anchal main basaa he mahadev kaa ek aisa mandir jo khud bayaan karata he is mandir ke sabase anokhe hone kii kahani
 Mahadev himself resides in its beauty that takes the mind and tells the story of the power of Shiva here
 isi mandir main duniya ke sabase oonche shivlinga ke saath hi kareeb 1 karod shivlinga bhi hai
 It is called Kotilingeshwar Dham, which is situated in Kammasandra, a small village in Kolar district of Karnataka
 is mandir main pravesh karte hi bhakton kii nazren ek tak keval mandir ke aakaar ko hi niharti hai kyonki yahaan basaa he mahadev kaa wo rup, jo shaayad duniya bhar main apni tarah kaa iklauta mandir he
 The size of the temple here is in the form of Shivalinga, which is also the highest Shivalinga in the world
 shivlinga rup main is mandir kii oonchai 108 feet he
 The devotees become fully Shiva by seeing this and testify about the 1 crore Shivling present around the temple
 koi bhi achambhe main pad saktaa he ki aakhir mukhya mandir ke aas-paas lakhon shivlinga kyon sthapit hai
 The secret of this marvel is hidden in the wishes of the devotees who come here
 is mandir main bhakt apane man main sachhee shraddha liye aate hai or apni samarthy ke anusaar 1 feet se lekar 3 feet tak ke shivlinga apane naam se yahaan sthapit karavaate hai
 It is the glory of Mahadev that now the number of these Shivalingas has reached about 1 crore
 is vishaal shiv-ling ke saamne nandi bhavy or vishaal rup main darshan dete hai, jisaki oonchai 35 feet he or vah 60 feet lambey, 40 foot chaude or 4 feet oonche chabutare par sthit he
 Statues of Goddess Maa, Shri Ganesh, Sri Kumaraswamy and Nandi Maharaj are installed around this huge Shiva-linga as if they are offering their worship to their deity
 mandir kaa yahi adbhut rup or har mannath puri hone kii manyata hi dur-dur se hajaaron bhakton ko yahaan khinch laati he
 On entering the temple, the devotees in the statue of Kotilingeshwar get to see the visions of Lord Mahadev and the naïve in the form of Kotilingeshwar is eager to defeat the sufferings of their devotees
 is puure mandir parisar main kotelingeshwar ke mukhya mandir ke alaava 11 mandir or bhi hai, jinamein brahmaji, vishnuji, annpurneshwari devi, venkatarmani swami, panduranga swami, panchmukh ganpati, ram-lakshmana-sita ke mandir mukhya rup se virajman hai
 It is believed that by tying yellow thread on two trees present in the temple premises, every wish is fulfilled
 visheshkar shaadi-byaah main aane vaali adchane dur ho jaati hai
 The marriage of girls from poor and poor families is also done on behalf of the temple at a nominal fee
 sari vyavastha mandir kii taraf se kii jaati he
 At the same time, proper arrangements are made for the living and eating of devotees coming from far and wide
 mahashivaratri par to is mandir kii chata dekhte hi banati he
 The number of devotees who earn a pious benefit reaches 2 lakh by paying their respects and sums to their deity
 or bhi hai mahadev ke chamatkaari mandirmahadev kaa judwa mandir sunne main ye baat thodi ajeeb jarur lagati he, lekin gujarat ke narmada nadi ke tat par ek aisa mandir he, jahaan ek chat ke neeche mahadev do roopon main darshan dete hai
 There are also two Nandi in this temple and that too face to face
 kehete hai jo koi mahadev ke in roopon ke darshanon kaa saubhaahgya hasil kar letaa he use moksh kii prapti ho jaati he
 In the Kailash temple of Agra, 2 Shivalingas are worshiped simultaneously
 yahaan mahadev kaa rup jitna chamatkaari he, utani hi chamatkaar kii kahaniyaan bhi
 Only then Lord Parashurama could not recognize this form of Mahadev and established two Shivalingas

 katak main srilanka ke khilaafapahale vanade main team indiyake donon opebers shikhar dhawan or ajinkya rahane ne shandaar batting kii, donon ne pehle wicket ke liye 231 ranon kii saajhedaari kii
 And both of them also scored centuries
 donon opebers centuri lagakarrecord bukse jud gaye
 This record is so important for Team India because it has played 864 odis so far and this is only the sixth chance for both openers to score a century in a single match
 ise aise bhi samajha ja saktaa he ki world cricket main ab tak kul 3539 vanade khele ja chuke hai or aisa keval 28veen baar hua he
 That is, this record could be made only 22 times other than India
 ek tareeke se dekha jaae to bhartiya darshakon ko kareeb 11 saal baad dekhne ko mili aisi batting kyonki vanade main team india ke donon opebers ke ek saath ek hi match main centuri lagaae 11 saal ho gaye hai
 Then Sachin and Sehwag did this feat against New Zealand
 in donon kii batting ne sachin, sahvaag or ganguli ke daur kii yaad dilaa di
 This was the period when ODI cricket repeatedly started to score above 300 runs
 vah aisa daur tha jab lagane laga tha ki ganguli, sahvaag, sachin, yuvaraj or dravid jaise ballebaajon se ati team 300 ranon se kam bhala kya banaaegi
 When Dhawan had made a brilliant century in his first match, it was felt that Sehwag will not miss
 lekin pichley ek saal se unka balla centuri ko taras rahaa tha
 While in Cuttack, he scored his sixth century in his career, where he battered his bat, but also took another step forward as the World Cup opener for Team India
 udhar lords main shatak ke baad jis rahane ko test kaa batsman kaha ja rahaa tha usne katak main centuri se sirf paanch match pehle edbeston main bhi shatak lagaaya tha or is match main unka strike rate (102
 77) was also fantastic
 kul milakar wo ab vanade formet main feet hi nahin balki opening ke liye solid opshan ban gaye hai
 After this batting performance, the selectors must have seen him as an option for the World Cup opener
 world cap agle saal farvari-march main khelaa janaa he aise main shikhar dhawan or rahane kii ballebaaji dekhakar yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki sachin, sahvaag or ganguli ke baad ye donon sabase behtareen opening jodidar banakar ubhare hai
 Among them is a good understanding of cricket, during the match, there was an incident that even a veteran like Sunil Gavaskar could not stop praising Rahane
 match ke dauraan ambati rayudu ne jab street drive lagaaya or gend bowler ke haathon se lagakar non striker aind par wicket se ja lagi to ajinkya rahane par out hone kaa khatra mandaraaya
 But here he held the bat in his right hand and dragged it to the crease which saved him narrowly
 camentry kar rahe diggaj sunil gavaskar ne tab unki tarif karte hue kaha ki nae ballebaajon ko yah siikhnaa chahie ki non striker and par khadey ballebaaj ke kis haath main balla hona chahie
 While the openers scored a good sign, the centuries of cricket are being considered good signs by Shikhar Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane, while Dhawan has also said that the top order batsmen are in good form and after scoring a century, they have also increased their confidence
 dhawan ne is pari main 113 ran banaae jabaki main of da match rahe ajinkya rahane ne 111 ran banaae
 Dhawan said, 'it is very important for a strong foundation
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘jab aap is tarah khelte hai to aapkaa apane upar bharosa badhata he or is tarah kii bhagidaari main shaamil hote hai to acha lagata he
 ' desh, duniya, mahanagar, khel, aarthik or bollywood main kya kuch hua

 | October (@maitri_varun)january 21, 2018 Pakistan's lies have been exposed in the name of investigation in the Pathankot case
 dosti ke naam par ab tak dagaa dene vaale jis padosi ke ghar pradhanmantri narendra modi beete dinon mohabbat kaa paigaam lekar gaye the, usne ek baar phir vahi kiya jiske liye vah janaa jaataa he
 Because it is reported that about a month after the terrorist attack, the neighboring country has not yet filed an FIR in the case, while its boss Nawaz Sharif has been roaming around the world advertising to complete the investigation in this regard
 yah sach us pakistan kaa bhi he, jiske pradhanmantri navaj sharif ne beete dinon daavos se lautate vakt naseehat di thi ki bharat-pakistan ko ek-duusare ke maamalon main dakhal nahin dena chahie
 Not only this, he also said that the investigation into the Pathankot attack has been completed and soon he is going to publicize this information
 jabaki sachai yah he ki maamle main jaanch aage bade iske liye ek FIR tak darj nahin kii gai he
 Neither custody, nor arrest, this is not the case of the truth of Pakistan
 is maamle membharat kii ore se tamaam sabootonke baavjood abhi tak na to moulana masood ajahar ko hiraasat main liya gaya he or na hi giraftaar kiya gaya
 Not only this, the three people whom Pakistan detained in the name of investigation, who they are and what information has been received, nothing has been shared with India
 bharat ko abhi tak padosi mulk ne is baat kii bhi jaankaree nahin di he ki maamle main usne kis kanoon or koun si dhaaraon ke tahat karrwai kii he
 However, Pakistan is constantly saying that the investigation is in final form and the phone numbers given by India as evidence are fake
 dilachasp baat yah he ki dikhaave ke liye hi sahi pakistan ne chah logon ke jaanch dal kaa gathan jarur kar diya he
 What said Nawaz Sharif office This double attitude of Nepakistan has come to the fore even after the office of Sharif's past said that three suspects have been detained in the Pathankot case last month including Jaish chief Masood Azhar
 12 janvari ko pakistani pradhanmantri ke karyaalay ne bharat ko ek shuruaati jaanch report saunpi he, jisamen kaha gaya he ki use masood ajahar ko giraftaar karne ke liye or sabooton kii jarurat he
 Masood Azhar is openly spewing Zaharnawaz Sharif says that Pakistan is very keen to increase friendship with India, but there is also a truth that in the meantime Maulana Masood Azhar is openly spewing poison against India
 beete 26 janvari yani bhartiya ganatantr diwas ke maukey par bhi usne ek jihadi magazine main bharat ke khilaaf aag lagaai he
 In his article, the terrorist has warned the Government of Pakistan to stop taking action against Jaish
 haalanki in sab ke bich bharat ne pakistan ko or saboot saunpane kii kavayad shuru kar di he

 It was also told that Shashi's memory was very sharp

 jisamen tasviir ke saath likhaa tha ki raaj or shammi kapur ke chote bhai jald hi debyue karne ja rahe hai
 After seeing this, Amitabh Bachchan thought in his mind that if there will be such people in the industry, then there is no chance of him

 Deepak Kochhar, husband of ICICI Bank CEO and Managing Director Chanda Kochhar, in a loan case of Rs 3250 crore, seems to be growing
 iskar vibhaag (IT) ne isiaisiai lone maamle main apni jaanch shuru kar di he
 Sources in the Income Tax Department told Aaj Tak that the agency has issued a notice to Deepak Kochhar's Nupower Renewable under the provisions of Section 131 of the IT Act

 arvind ne lagaae the aropapichley dinonisiaisiai bankeor videokon group ke niveshak arvind gupta ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chitthee likhakar bank ke rin dene ke taur tareekon par sawaal uthaaya
 He accused Chanda Kochhar of giving undue benefits to the Videocon business group of Venugopal Dhoot
 gupta ne pradhanmantri ko 15 march 2016 ko ye chitthee likhi thi
 They allege that Chanda wrongly took personal benefits in exchange for sanctioning two loans to Videocon of about Rs 4000 crore
 gupta ne chanda par morishas or camen island jaise tex haiven deshon main sthit companiyon ke jariye videokon ko lone dene kaa aarope lagaaya he
 However ICICI has defended its CEO Chandaka
 uski ore se kaha gaya he ki bank kaa koi bhi vyakti apane pad par itnaa sakasham nahin he ki bank ke credit se jude faislon ko prabhavit kar sake
 Arvind Gupta claimed that Nupower Renewables Private Limited (NRPL) was formed in a 50:50 partnership with Deepak Kochhar, husband of Videocon's chiefvenugopal Dhootane Chanda, and his 2 other relatives in 2008
 ek saal baad hi janvari 2009 main dhoot ne yah company chhod di
 He questioned and said that we need to know why Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot formed a joint venture and then Dhoot left it
 dhoot ne NRPL ke diarector pad se istipha de diya or apane kareeb 25,000 share deepak kochar ko hastantarit kar die
 In addition, in March 2010, Supreme Energy Private Limited, a company owned by Dhoot, gave a securitized loan of Rs 64 crore to NRPL, but by March 2010 Supreme Energy took over majority ownership of NRPL and Deepak owned only 5%
 Only left

 In April 2012, ICICI Bank gave Rs 3,250 crore to 5 companies of Videocon Group

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going on his third visit to neighboring Nepal today
 is daure ko donon deshon kii janata ke bich samparkon ko nayaa aayam dene vaala daura kaha ja rahaa he
 Nepal has always been an important country in India's foreign policy
 lekin haal ke varshon main dakshin asia main china kii badhati ruchi ke kaaran nepal ko lekar bharat kaaphi sajag ho gaya he
 Nepal is a mountainous country with only two countries
 teen taraf se bharat or tibet kii ore se china kii
 Nepal is largely dependent on India for its needs
 lekin bharat ke liye nepal ke sandarbh main china kii chunauti ab himalay parvat jaisi badi hoti ja rahi he
 Political changes in Nepal in the last decade, Maoist forces coming to power and China's entry into Nepal is a big challenge for India and Modi government will have to secure India's stake among them all
 teenon deshon ke rishton ke kai pahalu bharat kii chintaa badha rahe hai
 india-nepal relations have seen a lot of ups and downs in recent times in the perspective of Prime Minister Oli's proximity to China
 china ke kareebi maane jane vaale maovadi netaa or nepal ke pradhanmantri capi sharma oli ne apni duusari siyaasi pari kaa pehla videsh daura bharat kaa kiya
 He was on a tour of India from 6-8 April while he was also invited to visit China
 ise donon deshon ke bich santulan banane kii nepal kii koshish ke rup main dekha gaya
 China is playing the card of trilateral cooperation
 In the third week of April, Nepal's Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali was on a visit to China
 china ne nepal ko jodate hue rail samet tamaam pariyojnaon kaa elaan kiya or ummid jataai ki bharat bhi nepal kii khushhaali ke liye saath aayega
 But India is not showing interest in this trilateral project
 kyonki china ko lekar bharat main sanshay he
 Earlier, optical fiber project in Nepal, including internet service, China has made several announcements for Nepal
 lekin kya bharat ke liye itnaa aasaan he is gathjod kaa hissaa bananaa
 No, of course
 kya he tripaksheeya sahyog ke peeche china kii manshaa?tripaksheeya sahyog ke ofer ke peeche china kii ranneeti yahaan saaf dikh rahi he
 As China understands India's penetration in Nepal's society and its system, it wants to continue its economic, strategic and military intervention in Nepal without any conflict with India
 maovadi netaa oli kaa shashan main aana china ke liye ekadam anukool sthiti bhi he
 india-nepal relationship has been different India has a different kind of relationship with Nepal
 nepal kii siyasat se lekar videsh niti tak bharat kaa prabhaav kaaphi majboot rahaa he
 a large population of Nepal is associated with jobs or other types of employment in India
 nepal or bharat ke bich awa-jaahi ke liye vija kii jarurat nahin padati
 The Indian rupee moves fearlessly in Nepal
 nepal apni jarurat kaa adhikansh saamaan bharat se letaa he
 According to an estimate, more than 2 million Nepalese citizens live, work and live here in India
 jabaki china or honkong main rahane vaale nepali logon kii sankhya 20 hajaar se adhik nahin he
 Nepali citizens in India can easily come for work, treatment, studies, jobs, employment, while movement in China is not easy
 maovadi sarkaar banane ke baad badale halatlekin vahaan maovadi sarkaar banane ke baad se halaat badale hai
 During the previous reign of KP Oli, Nepal's relations with India had grown and our neighboring country Nepal had moved closer to China
 isliye bharat oli kii nai pahal ko bhi sanshay kii najar se hi dekhegaa
 Nepal's new government's priority appears to be to reduce economic dependence on India by expanding relations with China
 oli kaa yah kahana ki donon padosi deshon ke saath sahyog kar nepal aage badhanaa chahta he isi kaa sanket detaa he
 Why Nepal is looking for alternative routes other than India? Nepal is a land locked state and its focus is on the use of Chinese ports for foreign trade through agreements
 abhi nepal kaa adhikansh aayaat or niryaat bharat ke saath hota he or vah bharat ke bandargahon par puri tarah nirbhar he
 But at the time of Madhesi movement in 2015, there was a lot of problems due to the stoppage of border trade with India
 nepal main china kii koun-koun si pariyojnaayennepal aage aisi sthiti aane nahin dena chahta or bharat par puri tarah vyapaarik nirbharta kii bajaay china ke saath vaikalpik root taiyaar karne par kaam kar rahaa he
 There has been talk of construction of two highways, repair of ports, train service and expansion of air services between the two countries through Tibet
 china kerong se kathmandu, kathmandu se pokhara or lumbini tak rail line kii pariyojna main ruchi rakhata he
 It is worth noting that Lumbini is situated on the indo-nepal border and is very important for India due to the birthplace of Mahatma Buddha
 bharat ne kootnithik channelon se is pariyojna ko bhartiya suraksha hiton ke liye samvedansheel bataate hue apni chintaa jaahir kii he
 India has also increased its allocation for Nepal, in view of the challenge presented by China, India has also accelerated the work on its projects
 is vittiya varsh ke april maah se bharat ne nepal ke liye 650 karod rupee aavantit karne kaa faisla kiya he
 India has increased the amount of aid given to Nepal by 73 percent as compared to last year
 bharat ke saath bhi nepal kii rail link par baatcheet aage bad rahi he
 During this visit of KP Sharma Oli, an agreement was reached between India and Nepal on the kathmandu-raxaul rail link
 bharat is pariyojna ko or vistaar dekar china ke rail link ko chunauti dene kii koshish main he
 It remains to be seen which of the hill countries between China and India complete the task of providing the first rail link to Nepal
 van belt van road kii alag chunautinepal china kii van belt van road pariyojna se bhi jud gaya he
 Nepal is also looking to increase trade exchanges by opening several border posts from China
 iske alaava pokhara main international airport banane, kathmandu ring road kii pariyojna main bhi china kaam kar rahaa he
 China's growing intervention is forcing India to speed up its projects in Nepal, increase its investment
 bharat se zyada chini sailaani pahunche nepalchin ke saath nepal kaa pipul tu pipul conect bhi teji se bad rahaa he
 Between January and March this year, 36,384 Chinese tourists arrived in Nepal, while 34,133 Indian tourists reached Nepal during this period
 sainya sahyog par bhi china kaa focussainya level par bhi nepal china main dosti teji se badi he
 Last year, Nepal and China's military conducted the first joint exercise
 pichley 6 varshon main donon deshon ke bich 40 ucch stareey daure hue hai
 Nepal's political parties and intellectuals see China's BRI project as a big opportunity for progress
 vahiin bharat ke sahyog se jari pariyojnaon par dhimi gati se ho rahaa kaam bharat kii sthiti or bhi jatil bana rahaa he
 What are the issues about India, India has traditionally had very good relations with Nepal after Awakening, but now there is the challenge of China and in such a situation, India will have to take fast steps so that our closest neighbor country will be in the hands of rival like China Do not go in piem modi apane daure kii shuruyaat janakadham se kar rahe hai
 In Janakpur, Nepal's PM KP Sharma Oli will welcome PM Modi
 ramayana circuit ke jariye bharat nepal se vyapaar or dharmik conection behatar bananaa chahta he
 PM Modi's journey to Nepal will begin from Janakpur, which is a big step towards People to People Connect
 iske alaava piem modi nepal main chal raheen bhartiya pariyojnaon kii pragati kii samiksha bhi karenge taaki dwipaksheeya sambandhon ko nayaa aayam diya ja sake

 com / gwz3tz97xg The contestant Siza of the reality show 'dance Deewane' does not wear a surname with her name, nor does she want to see her father near her
 darasal, sija ke pita ladkaa chaahate the or jab unhen pataa chalaa ki sija ke maa kii kokh main ladki pal rahi he to unhone apni patni kaa aborshan karwaanaa chaha
 In the dance crazy, Siza said- 'because of me, my parents separated
 papa betaa chaahate the, lekin ladki hui
 He did not earn even a penny and used to take money from my mother
 wo mummy ko mere liye khilone, nae kapade or kitaaben kareedane se bhi rokte the
 They did not want me to go to private school
 'dance class jane ke liye 19 ki
 i used to walk Govinda, such was madness, he further said- 'I and my mother left them and came
 main abhi 19 saal kii hum or ghar se nikalne ke baad maine aaj tak unka cheharaa nahin dekha
 In school and college i found it very difficult to convince them that they are not part of my life, so i cannot get them signed on the farm
 'sija ne bataaya- 'wo meri mummy kii gardan pakad lete the or unhen lohe se jalaate the
 i did not go close to them
 haal hi main jab maine ek dance pratiyogita main hissaa liya tha to meraa naam akhbaar main chapa tha
 Seeing this, he sent me 1000 rupees
 maine wo paise unhen waapas kar die the
 Me and Mummy get used to living without them
 ham us daur se ab baahar aa chuke hai or ab unhen apane paas nahin chaahate
 'once upon a time, Govinda had done 40 films
 Let me tell you that Dance Deewane is a unique show, which gives three generations a chance to show their passion for dance
 is sho ko maadhuri dikshit naine, diarector shashaank khatan or tushaar kaaliya jaj kar rahe hai
 In North Pakistan, a jirga talked about action against women and men seen dancing in a video six months ago
 ek prantiy mantri ke anusaar mahilaon ke kabeeley ne video main dikh rahe ek vyakti ke teen bhaaiyon kii hatya kar di he
 This video came out in June last year
 is video ke saamne aane ke baad vivaadon main ghire mohammad afjal ke teen bhaaiyon kii pichley guruuvar ko kohistaan jile main goli maar kar hatya kar di gayi
 One person has also been injured in this incident
 khabar pakhtoonkhwaa praant ke soochna mantri miyaan iftikhar hossain ne kaha ki is maamle main 18 logon ke khilaaf praathmiki darj kii gayi he or police ko aropiyon kii giraftaar ke sambandh main nirdesh die gaye hai
 The video is of a wedding ceremony where women and men are seen dancing
 is video ke saamne aane ke baad bada vivaad paidaa ho gaya tha
 After this, a jirga sentenced two men and four women seen in the video to death
 salakhel kabeeley ke ek sadsy ne aarope lagaaya tha ki video main dikh rahi chaaron mahilaon kii hatya kar di gayi
 After this there was enmity between the Salakhel and the Suramkhel tribes
 jindagi main jeet-haar lagi rahati he or iske saath hi safalataa-vifaltaa bhi
 Its first realization was when i took the 10th board exam
 har students kii tarah board pariksha main achche numberon se paas hona meraa bhi sapana tha
 But disappointment came when disappointment came
 rigelt aane ke baad mujhe aisa sadma laga ki maine man main tay kiya ki ab padhai nahin karuungi
 i recognized that there is no use of reading and writing
 jab meraa rigelt aayaa tha tab papa kinhin kaarnon se ghar se baahar gaye hue the
 Like every parent, my parents also had high expectations from me
 unhen vishwaas tha ki mujhe achche marks milenge
 To tell the truth, i was more afraid of my low number, what my father would think of me, my friends would make fun of me
 yah sochakar main apane kamare main baithkar ghanton rote rahi thi
 Didn't know when i fell asleep crying
 achaanak se jab neend khuli to baraamde main se radio bajane kii aawaaj aa rahi thi
 Kishore Kumar's song on the radio, 'this is the way of life, is victory only after defeat
 
 
 ' baj rahaa tha
 It felt like this song was played for me
 main kamare se baahar nikali to dekha papa radio ke paas baithe hue the
 Dare not go out so went back to her room
 papa thodi der baad muskuraate hue aae
 He had a box of sweets in his hands
 papa ne mithai mujhe khilaai or poocha, 'colejajane ke liye cycle kab kharidni he?' maine rote hue kaha, 'mere achche marks nahin aae hai, cycle kharidkar kya karuungi?'papa ne jo jawaab diya tha vah mujhe abhi bhi acchhee tarah yaad he
 He said, 'you are my daughter cannot be so weak
 ek choti si pariksha bhala tumhaare puure kariyar ko kaise kharaab kar sakati he? chand sawaalon se koi safal yaa asafal nahin ho saktaa he
 Failures are those who are afraid of exams and do not want to work hard
 'maine apane papa ke un shabdon ko hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye ganth baandh liya or phir kabhi peeche mudakar nahin dekha
 Whenever i am disappointed or i do not see the way forward, i remember my father's words
 papa kii baaten mere liye jivan kaa saxes mantra he, jo mujhe kabhi haarane nahin degaa or kabhi tuutane nahin degaa

 How can you censor me after inviting me? Someone told me that this incident reminds me of the Emergency
 ' dhankhad ne kaha, 'itnaa dukhi tha ki is sadame se baahar aane main mujhe teen din kaa vakt laga
 'senior Trinamool leader Tapas Roy accused Dhankhar of' trying to make a point without talking 'and said,' Why is he commenting on this matter after a week? He is hungry for publicity
 vah is tarah se kaary kar rahe hai, jo rajyapal ko shobhaa nahin detaa he

 Sukhpal Khaira, MLA from Bholath, slammed Kejriwal for praising Bhagwant Mann for quitting alcohol
 khera ne kaha, 'maan kii tarif karte hue kejariwal kah rahe hai ki unhone bada kaam kiya he
 They should be ashamed to say so

 He also accused Kejriwal of being greedy for the post
 unhone kaha, 'pad ke liye vastav main laalchee to kejariwal hai

 ' Mumbai's Deputy Commissioner of Police (ACP) Iqbal Sheikh on Thursday confirmed that Kolkata Knight Riders team co-star and film star Shahrukh Khan had misbehaved with Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) officials at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday night
 shaikh ne emsie adhikariyon or shahrukh ke bich hui takaraar main bichbachaav kaa kaam kiya tha
 Shaikh said on Thursday that Shah Rukh was intoxicated, smelled of alcohol from his mouth but had come from outside drinking
 vah nashe kii haalat main emsie or bisisiai adhikariyon ko dhamkee de rahe the
 He had also uttered abuses to the officers
 niterides dwaara mumbai indiens ko haraane ke baad shahrukh kii bisisiai or emsie adhikariyon ke saath kahasuni hui thi
 Shah Rukh and his companions wanted to celebrate the victory by going to the venue of the prize distribution ceremony but were not allowed to do so
 shahrukh kaa gussa us samay saatven aasmaan par pahunch gaya, jab emsie adhikariyon ne flud lite buja di
 Sheikh, who is also a member of the MCA Management Committee, was present at the time
 vah teji se ghatana sthal par pahunche or sthiti ko kharaab hone se bachaaya
 Sheikh said that i took Shahrukh out because things were getting worse
 baatcheet ke dauraan shahrukh emsie or bisisiai adhikariyon ko gaaliyaan de rahe the
 We are investigating this matter
 yah puche jane par ki kis baat ne shahrukh kaa paara chadhaane kaa kaam kiya, shaikh ne kaha ki hamen is baat se matlab nahin ki shahrukh ko kis baat par gussa aayaa
 What we mean by this is that the incident happened inside the stadium
 is ghatana se naaraaz emsie shahrukh par vankhede stadium main pravesh par aaajeevan pratibandh lagane ke bare main soch rahaa he
 IPL Commissioner Rajiv Shukla has said that no decision has been taken so far in this regard and he would like to talk to both the sides before taking any decision
 bal thakare ke jivan par aadhaarit film thakare kaa aadha se zyada hissaa blike and white dikhaaya gaya he, lekin thakare kii image puri film main white hi dikhaai gai
 The film answers all the questions that have surrounded Bal Thackeray throughout his life
 phir chaahe wo loktantr main bharosa na karne kaa unka siddhant ho, yaa phir apatkaal kaa samarthan yaa phir maharashtra main bahari logon par bain kaa sawaal
 The film establishes from the beginning the fact that why did Bal Thackeray need to make Shiv Sena? Clearly, an attempt has been made to show how much injustice was being done to the Marathas in Maharashtra when Bal Thackeray was a minor cartoonist in a newspaper? After this, one by one in the movie, the allegations against Bal Thackeray have been clarified
 iske baavjood film ke ant main thakare kathghare main hi khadey najar aate hai
 The movie only presents Thackeray as a hero or the messiah of the Marathas
 ye darshakon ke liye koi nayaa tathy nahin he, lekin isaki kahani kehane vaale sanjay raut itane sakht or damadari se thakare kii clin image pesh karenge, ye theatre main hi pataa chalata he
 Nawazuddin Siddiqui plays as Thackeray throughout the film, his stardom is seen in every scene
 ve kahin kamjor nahin pade, chaahe babari masjid giraane kaa aarope ho yaa phir dangon main haath hone kaa
 Nawaz's actress Nawazuddin Siddiqui has been seen doing full justice to his character
 unhone thakare ke lahaze, haavbhaav or unke talkh andaaj ko pakadaney kii koshish kii, jisamen unke prabhavi samvaad chaar chand lagane jaise rahe, lekin har samay ek sakhti kaa aavaran odhe rahanaa unke jivan ke us paksh ko saamne nahin laa paata, jisamen ve ek pita, pati yaa komal hryday vaale kalakaar bhi hai

 _siddiqui) onjan 19, 2019 at 5:18 am PST The Shiv Sena has also tried to police the image with Thackeray's excuse
 un sab sawaalon ko justiphi kiya gaya he, jinamein shivasena kii kattar hindutv kii chhavi, gaiyr marathiyon par gundgardee or raajnneetik dhruvikaran ke aarope lagate hai
 It is possible that the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra will also get political benefits due to 'thackeray' in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 darshak film ke ant main isi nishkarsh par pahunchataa he ki kahani kehane vaala jabardasti chote-chote samvaad or drishyon ke jariye darshak se kuch manvaanaa chahta he yaa phir kisi aarope main safai di ja rahi he
 It is obvious that Thackeray was quite clear about his ideology, which is visible in all media interviews, but the facts he presents in his (thackeray) defense seem weak
 film spasht taur par apane agenda par ant tak kaayam rahati he
 What in the story? Talking about the story, all the aspects of Thackeray's life were closely displayed, which influenced his political ideology
 kahin-kahin unki chhavi itani udaar dikhaai gai ki ve ek muslim ko apane ghar par navaj padhane kii ijaajat de dete hai, vahiin agle hi seen main yah ghoshnaa karte najar aate hai ki ve sirf or sirf hindutv ke agenda par chunaav ladenge
 They say that "being impotent of people is better than being a goon of my people
" jab system ke shoshan ke kaaran logon kii ridh pis gai thi, tab maine unhen sidhaa khadaa hona sikhaaya
 "abhijit Panse, director of camera work and lighting, exploited it to say his words effectively
 film us bal thakare kii ek god fadar vaali image dikhaati he, jiske paas apane upar lage har aarope kaa jawaab he
 If you want to see the doctrine of the Messiah of the needy who rise up against injustice, with cinematic temper, then Thackeray is for you
 film main navaj ke alaava anya koi kirdaar ubharkar saamne nahin aata, lekin aapako ingez banaae rakhane ke liye navaj ke alaava kisi or kii jarurat bhi nahin padegi

 The farmers of Baghpat, the main parliamentary constituency of the sugarcane belt, one hundred and fifty kilometers away from the country's capital, are also fighting tirelessly

 The figures of the sugarcane commissioner's office also indicate the reason for the anger of the farmers

 "to curb the growing discontent among the sugarcane farmers and the electoral losses that have been caused by it, the BJP has put forward sugarcane minister Suresh Rana in the UP government and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Pal Singh Tomar, former national president of the BJP Kisan Morcha

 ab kareeb chaar maah kaa bhugtan hi bakaayaa he jise perai satr khatm hone se pehle puraa kar diya jayega
 The government's announcements for sugarcane farmers and the first phase of elections in western UP have become interesting for the opposition engaged in cashing out the pending payment issue, in which the BJP faces a very tough challenge to preserve the unilateral victory of 2014
 
 soshal ejineeringloksabhaa chunaav ke ummidavaaron kaa chayan karne ke liye bhaajapa ne teen str par survey karaayaa
 In these, there were reports against the sitting MP in many seats of the first phase elections, but the BJP dared to take on the new candidate in front of the strong alliance of Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD)
 Could not gather jat matadaataaon ke bich khoi saakh paane main jute ralod adhyaksh choudhary ajit singh mujffarnagar loksabhaa kshetra se gathbandhan ke ummidavaar ke rup main saamne hai
 In the event of BJP launching non-jat candidates, Ajit Singh would have got unilateral support of Jat voters, so BJP could not see any suitable candidate from Sanjeev Baliyan

 Ajit Singh was marginalized after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots
 yaheen se loksabhaa chunaav ladakar ve apane paramparaagat jat-muslim matadaataaon ke gathjod ko dobaaraa paane main jute hai
 To encircle them, the BJP has fielded Jat candidates in Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat

 Professor at Meerut College, Dr
 manoj sivaach kehete hai, ''mayawati ko basapa ke musalmaan or dalit netaaon main congress kii sendhamari khatak rahi he
 For this fear, she does not want to take the Congress along at any cost
 ''basapa se alag-thalag padi congress ne kuch siton par majboot ummidavaar utarkar gathbandhan or bhaajapa ke bich sidhe mukaable ko trikoniya kar diya he
 This same strategy of Congress has raised the temperature of Bijnor Lok Sabha seat extending to Meerut and Muzaffarnagar
 yahaan pichhlaa loksabhaa chunaav basapa ke maluk nagar, bhaajapa ke bhaaratendra singh se haar gaye the
 Nasimuddin Siddiqui, the then National General Secretary of the BSP, camped in Bijnor for several days to get Muslim votes in that election
 nagar is baar chunaav main bijanour seat se gathbandhan ummidavaar ke rup main maidan main hai or congress ne siddiki ko tikat dekar musalmaan voton ke liye rankshetra sajaa diya he
 Similarly, Imran Masood of Congress and Haji Fazlur Rahman of BSP are face to face in Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat
 devband ke samajasevi moulana hasanul hashmi bataate hai, ''gathbandhan or congress ke bich talmail na hone se pashchimi upi kii kai siton par muqabla trikoniya ho gaya he
 In such a situation, Muslim voters will have to use their votes very wisely
 ''basapa se dalit vot khinchne ke liye congress kaa bhim army ko aage karnaa bhi mayawati ko khatak rahaa he
 There is doubt about the activism of Chandrasekhar, the founder of Bhim Army, who supported Congress candidate Imran Masood in Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat in other Lok Sabha seats
 tikat bantwaare ko lekar congress main asantosh bhi he
 Local leaders are angry with Congress's ticket to Arvind Singh Chauhan, son of BJP Legislative Council member Thakur Jayveer Singh from Gautam Budh Nagar Lok Sabha seat
 varisht congress netaa raghuraaj singh kehete hai, ''2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle congress pratyaashee bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaya tha, thik vaisaa hi is baar bhi ho jaae to aashcharya nahin karnaa chahie
 The BJP also chose Saharanpur for a joint rally of SP, BSP and RLD alliance on 7 April at Deoband, the center of Islamic education in Saharasharanpur, to polarize
 saharanpur main 24 march ko bhaajapa ke chunavi abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karne pahunche mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne behat ke baba bhuradev mandir main puja kii
 He then bowed at the Shakambhari Devi temple, a kilometer from here

 Yogi started the speech with Vande Mataram
 apni sarkaar ke vikaas ke kaary ginate-ginate yogi dharmik muddon par aa gaye
 Successful organization of Kumbh, renovation of religious places did not attract applause, as did his statement that Congress candidate Imran Masood was called son-in-law of terrorist Azhar Masood
 yogi ne raily main logon se poocha, ''ajahar masood kii bhashaa bolne vaala chunaav jitegaa ki pradhanmantri modi ke sachche sipahasaalar ke rup main kshetra main vikaas karne vaala
 Targeting SP-BSP, he said, "why should the police be deprived of celebrating Krishna's birthday?" Our government allowed Kavad Yatra to be taken out with full pomp, DJ and hour-gong
 pehle is par roak kyon thi?'' sapa-basapa par nishaanaa sadhakar bhi yogi ne bhaajapa kii line spasht kar di
 Says RJD president Ajit Singh, "the BJP has come down to the politics of polarization for fear of defeat
" is baar chunaav main samajhadaar janata inaki daal nahin galane degi
 In western UP, the BJP is referring to the Kandar Yatra in Pakistan with successful conduct of air strikes, terrorism, Kumbh in every of its election meetings
 asal main mujffarnagar, bagpat jaise loksabhaa siton par sidhi chunavi ladaai main fansi bhaajapa dhurveekaran ke jariye in siton par camel khilaane kii aas lagaae baithi he
 This time in the Lok Sabha elections, the BSP and SP have asked their Muslim leaders to refrain from making such statements that would give the BJP an opportunity to incite anti-muslim sentiments
 meerut vishvavidhyalay main associat professor manohar singh kehete hai, ''2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main musalmaan netaaon ke vivaadaaspad bayanon ne hindu matadaataaon ko inke khilaaf ekajute kiya tha jiskaa phayda bhaajapa ko mila tha
 This time, due to the restraint of Muslim leaders, there is no situation like previous elections
 ''varsh 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav or 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main pashchimi upi main hue pehle charan kaa chunaav jis party ne jeeta vahi ant tak aage bani rahi
 That is why the election of this area has become very important
 *** Was Nehru the first PM to interview adult magazine Playboy? This question continues to dominate social media
 kai baar to isko lekar nehru or congress party kii viraasat ke bare main vivaadaaspad tippaniyan bhi kii jaati hai
 Recently a debate on this issue was resumed with a Twitter account @churumuri
 is acount ke kareeb 50 hajaar folover hai, jinamein kai badi hastiyaan shaamil hai
 It cites a tweet (@being_humor) of a Maithun (24 ° C) who claimed on the basis of an alleged tweet from Playboy magazine that Nehru had actually given an interview to the magazine
 @churumuri ke anusaar yah bharat ke 'phek monstors' kii cargujari he
 He insisted that @playboy's tweet was actually fake
 is bahes ko dekhte hue hamane yah tay kiya plaboy-nehruvivaad par ek viral test kiya jaae, jiske bare main jaanata to har koi he, lekin log samaj nahin paa rahe ki kis par bharosa kiya jaae
 We started keeping an eye on Maithun (24 ° C) (@being_humor), which claimed that Playboy magazine itself tweeted about Nehru's interview
 twitor timeline dekhne par hamen yah najar aata he ki Maithun (24°C) (@being_humor) ne iske bare main 12 oktober, 2017 ko twit kiya tha
 In his tweet, he wrote tauntingly on Congress, # knowyourlegacy and insisted that, 'congress has deleted this tweet
 'hamane Maithun (24°C) ke twit or uske aadhaar par kiye ja rahe daavon kii pramanikta kii jaanch kii koshish kii
 The Twitter handle of Playboy magazine is @playboy and its 14
 3 lakh folover hai
 We examined @playboy's timeline quite thoroughly, but we could not find any tweets about Nehru's interview
 ab sawaal uthta he ki kya pehle aisa koi twit tha jise baad main @playboy ne delit kar diya, jiske bare main Maithun (24°C) daawa kar rahaa he, ham iske bare main pukhta taur par kuch nahin bataa sakate
 @churumuri is right to say that the font seen in Maithun (24 ° C) tweet is different from the font used by Twitter
 yah bhi kaaphi gaur karne vaali baat he ki Maithun (24°C) ke twit menjawahar laal nehruki ssailing galat likhi gai he
 It says "jawsharlal" while claiming that it is a tweet from @playboy which was deleted by Congress
 ab aate hai bahes vaale sawaal par- kya plaboy ne jawaharlal nehru kaa intervyuu kiya tha? hamen iske bare main www
 forbes
 com main 3 oktober, 2017 ko chapa raunak di
 a detailed article by Desai was found
 is artical main yah bataaya gaya he ki jawaharlal nehru kaa intervyuu vastav main 1963 main plaboy patrika ke oktober ank main prakashit hua tha
 It was published under the 'playboy Interview' series started in 1962 by the magazine
 is tathy kii or tah main jane ke liye ham plaboy patrika ke pichley ankon (archive) tak pahunche
 The cover page of the magazine of October, 1963 edition features a mischievous smile picture of beautiful model Elsa Martinelli and proudly proclaims on the cover - 'an Exclusive Interview with Nehru of India'
 patrika ke is sanskaran ke pej 51 parajwaharlal nehruka ek vistrut intervyuu he or yah kai pej main chapa he
 At the beginning of the interview, it was written, 'prime Minister Nehru gave this exclusive interview in the fragrant complex of his house at 10, Teen Murti Marg, New Delhi residence
 apane chirpit gandhi topi or bhure frock kot or ek cigarette kaa kash lagaate hue
 
 
 He only smokes five cigarettes a day
 
 
 'is artical main intervyuu lene vaale kaa naam nahin he, lekin cover phota ke saath shuruyaat main ullekh he ki henry slasar dwaara liya gaya plaboy intervyuu
 Henry Slaser was an American playwright, writer, and copy writer, who died in 2002
 is intervyuu main nehru ne mahatma gandhi se lekar rabindra nath tagore, chini hamalaa, gut nirpeksh andolan jaise tamaam masalon par baat kii
 Now if there is such strong documentary evidence of Nehru's interview, why is there so much controversy about it? It says - 'when the rest of the magazine had gone to press for publication, we got a message from the Indian Embassy in Washington that The interview we have with PM Nehru was not really based on exclusive, personal interactions with the head of India, but by the Prime Minister It is a compilation of all the speeches, statements etc
 given in previous years
 'iskaa matlab yah he ki bhartiya duutavas ke mutabik nehru ne kabhi bhi plaboy ko koi intervyuu nahin diya or kathith rup se intervyuu lene vaale ne bas saarvajanik taur par uplabdh nehru ke bayanon or anya jaankariyon ko jutakar use intervyuu kii shakl de di or use chhapane ke liye plaboy patrika ko bhej diya
 But in the same note of the editor, it has been claimed by the magazine that 'we have been sent material about Nehru by a respected journalist-publisher who has interviewed all such celebrities around the world before it
 yah hamen ek vaastavik intervyuu ke rup main bechaa gaya tha, tepe par isaki recording kii gai thi or iske saath kavring letters bhi tha,jisamen yah bataaya gaya tha ki saamagree main pradhanmantri or unke saath patrkaar kii photo bhi shaamil he
 So there was no reason to doubt the validity of this interview and we published it as a personal interview with good faith
 'haalanki, is par vivaad hone ke baad bhi plaboy ne kabhi intervyuu lene vaale patrkaar kii nehru ke saath kathith photo ko prakashit nahin kiya, isliye iske bare main andeh bana rahaa
 forbes
 com ke lekh ke mutabik, 'nehru ke tathakthith plaboy intervyuu ko bharat main bhi jabardast charchaa mili
 The magazine was already banned in India because of the moralistic people of the country
 lekin plaboy kaa oktober ank sabase zyada maang vaali desh kii varjit vastuon main shaamil ho gaya
 Due to Nehru's name on the cover, copies of this magazine started coming in large numbers through smuggling into the country, that too at a price up to 30 times the original price
 jaisaa ki ek akhbaar ke sampadak kaa kahana he, 'oktober kaa ank to shivaaj reagal kii ek bottle se bhi zyada mahangaa mil rahaa tha
 'this issue of Playboy magazine in October 1963 is still in great demand due to this controversy that has been going on for years
 lekin is sawaal kaa abhi bhi kuch pukhta jawaab nahin diya ja saktaa- kya nehru ne vastav main plaboy ko intervyuu diya tha

 ISIS ab nahin failaa paaegaa apana propegandaye baaten obama ne pentagon main apane 8 minute ke sambodhan main kahin
 However, Obama said that it will no longer be easy for ISIS to spread propaganda in the world
 kyonki gathbandhan senasake ek-ek netaa ko khatm kar rahi he, lekin unhone is aatanki sanghathan ke khilaaf banaai gai kisinai ranneetika khulaasa nahin kiya

 There are two things on the faces of successful people, one is silence and the other is an accident falling down Is, but it is your choice to keep reading, do not tell your spirits how big your problem is, tell your trouble that you Encouraging much greater uttar pradesh kii mukhyamantri mayawati ne apane mantriparishad ke do or mantriyon atirikt urja strot rajyamantri (swatantra prabhaar) akbar hossain or vigyaan evam praudyogiki vibhaag ke rajyamantri yashpal singh ko barkhaast kar diya he

 It is worth mentioning that recently, Chief Minister Mayawati sacked four more ministers of her council of ministers, Higher Education Minister Rakeshadhar Tripathi, Agriculture Education Minister Rajpal Tyagi, Minister of State (independent Charge) of Backward Classes Welfare Department Awadhesh Verma and Home Minister Department of State Hariom Was

 dibaakar chaahate the kii aamir unki film main villen ke kirdaar nibhaaen
 Significantly, when Aamir was told the script of Vyomkesh Bakshi, at the same time, Aditya Chopra had also told Aamir the script of the film 'dhoom 3'

 Bev will definitely have an impact on ecology

 On Tuesday, Sonia Gandhi came out to campaign for Congress in Karnataka
 unhone bijapur main chunavi sabha kii or centre main sattarudh bijepi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 Sonia Gandhi has given a speech at an election rally after almost two years
 isse pehle vah uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaav se pehle teen agast 2016 ko piem modi ke sansadeey ilaake varanasi main road sho karne utari thim
 During this time his health deteriorated and he was immediately airlifted and brought to Delhi
 iske baad se vah chunaav prachaar se duuri banaae hue thim
 Meanwhile elections were held in several states including Gujarat and Punjab, but Sonia did not give a speech in them
 isse samajha ja saktaa he ki karnataka vidhansabha chunaav congress ke liye kitne ahm hai
 Sonia targeted PM Narendra Modi in her first rally in Karnataka
 yahaan unhone karnataka main siddharmaiya kii sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginane se zyada bijepi sarkaar ke chaar saalon ke kaamkaaj ko apane nishane par liya
 Know what 10 big attacks he did on PM Modi
 1- aapane suna hoga ki siddharmaiya kii sarkaar ne indira canteen bhi shuru kii he, jisamen garibon ko khaanaa miltaa he
 Sadly, Congress opponents oppose our effective plans
 hamane desh bhar main logon ko rojgaar dene ke liye manaregaa yojana shuru kii thi
 Even then BJP and Narendra Modi joked about it
 2- karnataka main anndaata tamaam kathinaaiyon kaa saamana kar rahe hai, yahaan chaar saalon main aisa sookhaa padaa, jaisaa das saalon main nahin padaa tha
 Therefore, your Chief Minister asked Modi ji for time to help you
 modi ji ne madad karnaa to dur mukhyamantri se milane se bhi inkaar kar diya
 i want to ask Modi ji why he insulted not only the CM but also the people of Karnataka? 3- Modi government gave thousands of crores to the states where there was a drought, but sprinkled salt on the wounds of the farmers of Karnataka He gave them the least money
 main puuchhati hum, modi ji, kya yahi he aapkaa sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas? siddharmaiya ji ne 22 lakh kisaanon ke karj maaf kiye
 In addition, more schemes were introduced, which made it one of the three most advanced states in the export of fruits, vegetables and spices
 4- congress vikaas kaa kaam kar rahi he to modi ji chaar saalon se congress ke achche kaamon ko khatm kar rahe hai
 Modiji has a passion for Congress-free India, he has felt the ghost of Congress-free India
 congress mukt bharat to chhodie, vah apane saamne kisi ko bhi sweekaar nahin kar sakate hai
 5- Modi ji is proud that he gives a very good speech, i agree with this
 vah ek achche orator hai or ek abhinayta kii tarah bhaashan dete hai
 If his speech can fill the nation's stomach, then give more speeches
 lekin keval bhaashan se pet nahin bhar saktaa, iske liye daal-chaaval chahie
 The sick cannot be cured by Modi ji's speech, for this a hospital is needed
 modi ji ke bhaashan se meri bahanon kaa shashaktikaran nahin ho saktaa, naujavaanon ko rojgaar nahin mil saktaa, kisaanon ko raahat or suvidhaayen nahin mil saktin
 For this, there should be strong intention and good resolve
 6- mahangaai aasmaan chhu rahi he
 Every section of society is facing trouble in life, it has never happened before
 in sabaki parvaah na karke modi sarkaar petrol-dijal or gharelu gas kii keemten badhaati ja rahi he
 7- The country is surprised to see that PM Modi speaks wrong wherever he goes, playing with history, using freedom fighters as chess for his politics
 kya is tareeke kii baaten karnaa ek piem ko shobhaa detaa he? kya aapane pehle kabhi aisa piem dekha tha, jo sirf baaten hi baaten karata ho or asli muddon par khamosh rahata ho, ek bhi baat nahin bolta ho?8- janata se chaar saal pehle kiye vaadon main se koun sa vaada puraa hua, bataaie ki desh ke kisaanon ke liye kya kiya, yuvaaon ko rojgaar dene ke liye kya kiya, madhyamvarg ke liye, mahilaayein, bacchon, daliton pichhadon kii suraksha ke liye kya kiya he?9- modi ji aapke bhrashtachar mitaane ke pasandida vaade kaa kya hua? chaar saal baad bhi lokapal kyon nahin laayaa gaya? bhrashtachar mitaane kaa aapkaa model koun sa he? karnataka main aapke aas-paas jo log rahete hai yaa dilli main jin logon par bhrashtachar ke aarope hai yaa phir aap apane sabase kareebi saathi ke bete kaa model apanaayenge?10-congress kii samskritilogon ko jodna or saath laana he,modi ji chunaav main aate hai, khokhale vaade karte hai or nafrat failaakar chale jate hai
 Do not let this strategy of BJP succeed, expose each and every jumla
 sushant singh rajput aurasara ali khanki bahupratikshit film "kedarnath" relies se pehle hi charchaaon main he
 The release of the film was postponed due to a mutual dispute during production
 kaha gaya ki ye film 2019 main hi relies ho paaegi
 But recently the teaser of the film was released and now it is discussed that the film will be released in December
 film kii kahani 2013 main uttarakhand kii prakritik aapadaa par aadhaarit he, jisamen dharmik yatra par gaye shraddhaluon ko bade paimaane par jaan ganvaani padi
 Directed by Abhishek Kapoor, the film is produced by Ronnie Screwvala's production
 is film kii charchaa kii teen vajahen bahut khaas hai
 First, the casting of Sara Ali Khan as the lead actress
 sara, saf ali khan or unki pehali patni amrutha singh kii beti hai
 The discussion started because Sara was a debut film
 doosraa, film ke nirmaataa or nirdeshak ke bich vittiya vivaad saamne aae, vivaad itnaa badha ki yah court tak pahunch gaya or kaha gaya ki vivaadon main padane se film kaa nuksaan hoga
 Difficulties also began to appear on its release date
 teesri or sabase badi vajah he uttarakhand kii maha prakritik aapadaa
 a disaster in which hundreds of families of devotees from various regions, castes and societies succumbed to the wrath of nature
 unhen apni jaan ganvaani padi thi
 View this post on instagramno tragedy, no wrath of nature, no act of God can defeat the power of love! Presenting the official # kedarnathposter, teaser out at 12 noon! 👀🙏❤️ @sushantsinghrajput # ronniescrewvala @gattukapoor @pragyadav @gitspictures @rsvpmovies @zeemusiccompany # kedarnath # jaibholenath # shambhua post shared bysara Ali Khan (@ saraalikhan95) onoct 29, 2018 at 12:16 pm PDT movie due to teaser and now It is coming to the fore, due to which it has become necessary to discuss this film
 is film main bhartiya samaaj kii us dukhte jakhm par haath rakh diya gaya he, jise chune se aksar avaanchit vivaadon ke mawaad bahane lagate hai
 After a long time, the popular Hindi cinema section is taking the risk of showing a love story in Indian society in which a Hindu girl (mukku: Sara Ali Khan) is in love with a Muslim boy (mansoor: Sushant Rajput)
 lokapriy dhara main hindu ladki or muslim ladke main prem ko lekar is tarah ke udhaaharan vaali filmein bahut kam rahi hai
 Whenever such love stories have been selected, our hero has been coming from the group that claims to be a native of India
 mandir andolan ke baad mumbai main dangon ke balldrop par bani bombai ho yaa bharat pakistan ke bantwaare kii kaalpanik kahani par bani sani deol kii gadar
 The heroines of both films are Muslim
 bombai kaa nayak brahman hindu jabaki gadar kaa nayak bhartiya paramparaon main chalane vaala sikh
 These traditions have been maintained before and after the religious movement deepened after the temple movement in India
 kuch sameekshak yah bhi maanate rahe hai ki nirmaataa bahumat kii tushti (cinemagharon tak laane ke liye) ke liye hi popular dhara main hindu pariwaron kii kahaniyon ko cinema ke parde par dikhaate rahe hai
 For this reason, Mani Ratnam, who is famous for making films on daring subjects, also should not move towards risk in Bombay
 ishkajade se anand raay kii "ranjhna" tak is parampara main filmein banane kaa ek lanbaa silsilaa or udhaaharan hai
 At the time of the release of the films whose examples are given, the society from which the heroine comes, those people opposed the filming of the heroine heroines in the film
 haalanki in filmon ke bich 2003 main chandraprakash dvivedi kii pinjar kaa bhi udhaaharan dilachasp he
 The film was based on the story of Amrita Pritam, in which India is divided by Pakistan
 film main manoj vaajapeyi, urmila matondkar, sanjay suri jaise kalakaar the
 The film also has the story of a Muslim hero and a Hindu heroine
 jisamen hindu nayika muslim nayak ke saath rahane kaa faisla karti he
 The unfortunate part of this film was that at the time of its release, it was called an artistic category film, due to which it could not reach the wide audience of Hindi cinema
 haalanki baad main tivi ke darshakon ne is film ko pasand kiya or saraahaa bhi
 View this post on Instagram Happy Teacher's Day @gattukapoor
 is din par main aapkaa shukriya adaa karnaa chaahati hoon ki aapane mujhekedarnathki is yatra par le janaa uchit samajha
 i will always be grateful to you for this opportunity, for your encouragement and for your patience towards me
 🙏🙏🙌🏻🌸🌸 # kedarnath # jaibholenath # shambhua post shared bysara Ali Khan(@saraalikhan95) onsep 5, 2018 at 1:57am pdthalamki pichley teen dashak main ikkaa dukka aisi kahaniyaan bhi ai hai jinamein hindu ladkaa or muslim ladki se tasviir ulat he
 If you remember, you will get the example of Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol's film "my Name is Khan" a decade ago
 aamir khan kii pike main bhi anoushka ke apojit ek muslim kirdaar kii maujuudagi najar aati he
 Although the references to both the above films are different
 maai nem ij khan main muslim nayak or hindu nayika kaa saamaajik parivesh puri tarah bhartiya nahin he
 After the World Trade Tower, it is communicating to an audience that is struggling with religious identity or Yoon Say Me racial identity in America
 pike main bhi hindu ladki or muslim ladke ke bich prem he, lekin ye ek goud sandarbh he jise dharmik dhakoslon kaa virodh karne ke liye upkahaani ke taur par dikhaaya gaya he
 This is the reason why apart from love story everything is in focus
 anoushka ke saath muslim kirdaar ke prem se zyada focus duusare grah se aae jeev aamir khan kii uske prati bhaawanaaon ko lekar he
 Why this risk in Kedarnath? Is Kedarnath a film that is trying to break the tradition of popular Hindi cinema
 kedarnath kii puri kahani saamne to nahin ai he, lekin yah saaf he ki ye aapadaa ke bich ek hindu-muslim prem kahani he
 The question is, would it be appropriate to show such a pair of heroes or heroines in the kind of story "kedarnath"? Does the story matter? Is this dispute only to invite? View this post on instagramhum jahan baith te hain, indradhanush wahin se shuru hota hai, naam hai @saraalikhan95 # jaibholenath 🙏 # kedarnath # kedarnaththemovie @sushantsinghrajput @pragyadav @rsvpmovies @gitspictures # ronniescrewvalaa post shared byabhishek kapoor(@gattukapoor) onoct 31, 2018 at 1:02am pdtesa ho bhi saktaa he or nahin bhi
 There has been a debate on whether such points are discussed and disputed on behalf of producers to promote films
 tamaam udhaaharan hai ki vivaadon se guzarane vaali filmon ne tikat khidki par badhiya pradarshan kiya he
 There were also many films in which the content was not that they should get bumper success
 sanjay lila bhansaali kii "padmavat" ke puure vivaad main bhi yah aarope saamne aae ki tamaam chijen jaan-boojhkar pland thim, jo baad main gale kii haddi ban gayi
 It may be so, but from the point of view of originality, it was necessary to have the opposite female character of the heroine in the story based on the true event
 poster or tiger se jaahir hota he ki sushant kaa charitra muslim he jo tirthasthal main kuli kaa kaam karata he
 It is also an interesting fact that at all the pilgrimage sites like Vaishno Devi, Amarnath or Kedarnath, only the people of Muslim society do the work of the coolies
 kahani ke hisaab se nayak kaa muslim hi hona jaruri tha
 So the Titanic itself is based on the climax events and teasers of the film, a Hindu girl on a religious visit to Kedarnath starts to like the Muslim coolie
 donon kaa prem paravaan chadhataa he or baad main prakritik aapadaa ke dauraan ladkaa chamatkaarik dhang se hindu ladki ko bachaata he
 However, in the era of love jihad, the heroine of this film also remains a Hindu
 subject ke mutabik yah kah sakate hai ki film kaa clymex titannic kii tarah hi hoga
 The tide of majority emotions is successful at the box office, the girl should be a Hindu, perhaps the Muslim hero will have to die in the film
 prem jehan main rakhane kii cheez he
 Poet, lyricist and actor Swanand Kirkire said after watching the film Jugni that it is a true and lovely love story
 yah film is shuukravaar relies ho rahi he
 The music of this film is already being well liked
 is film ke saath nirdesan kii duniya main apni shuruyaat kar rahi hai shefali bhushan

 The name was appropriate for both the film and my life

 However, we named our production house Dhun Productions
 film kii shuruyaat main mujhe sach main andaja nahin tha ki aakhir janaa kahaan he
 i like to do many things, such as painting, acting, singing, dancing and directing
 maine sochaa apni sari urja lagaakar kyon na ek film banaai jaae
 Staying in Bollywood is a difficult task
 yah industry aapke andar kaaphi kuch badal detaa he lekin isi dauraan aapako apane aap ko bachaana bhi hota he or prerit bhi karnaa hota he
 You have been a student of journalism, till now you have worked on non-fiction as a director, writer
 aap beet of india main bhi thim
 In such a situation, how did the fitoor make a feature film? Shefali: The story of working in the Beat of India is also interesting
 meri khaas dost aiana ne mujhe ek fasebuk par ek link bheja
 In this, Steve Jobs gave a speech at Stanford University
 isamen steve jobs ne kaha tha ki agar aap kal mar jate hai to yah sochiega ki aap aaj tak kar rahe the kya usase puri tarah santusht hokar mar rahe hai
 When i asked myself this question, the answer was no
 to maine tay kiya ki ab main vah kaam karuungi jiske liye vaaki mere andar aag ho
 i wanted to make a film
 iske baad kii sari taiyaari jugni ke is rup main pahunchane kii yatra he
 Your film's main character Vibhavari has something that is in all women
 vibhavari or aap main kya samanta he?shefali:vibhavari bhi sangeet kii talash main he or main bhi
 His journey to find himself also resembles my journey to a great extent
 uske dimag or dil ke bich santulan bithaane kii koshish aisi he jisase ham sab jhujhate hai or baaki sab kaalpanik he
 (laughs) Jugni is a musical love story
 aapane alag-alag kism ke gaanon se ek kahani kahi he
 There is Rahman among the singers and Vishal Bhardwaj too
 yah kitna mushkil tha?shefali:sangeet ke saath meraa gaharaa naata he
 i have been learning music since childhood
 clinton serejo (film ke sangeetkaar) ke saath kaam karnaa shandaar rahaa
 i have come to train Hindustani music and that of Western music
 is tarah hamaari jugalbandi kaaphi acchhee rahi
 The music in the film is used in quite an interesting way
 becoground mujeec dhimaa he lekin kaaphi der tak prabhaav chhodane vaala he
 The songs in this film carry the story forward
 aapane punjab ke real lokeshnon par shooting kii
 How was the experience? Want to tell a memorable anecdote during the shoot? Shefali: Real Location is the life of the film Jugni
 har ek cheez ne film main kuch joda hi he
 Whether it is Bibi Sarup's house or the yellow color of their walls
 bibi sarup ke ghar kii chat shandaar he
 We have shot quite important scenes of the film here
 ek seen tha jise hamane chat par hi filmaaya tha
 It was a song in which everyone had to dance
 seen ke ant main sara gaanv naach rahaa tha
 When Mastana jumps from this roof, my breath got stuck even during that time
 or phir yah meri pehali film he to mere liye iskaa har ek seen special he
 You come from a family of lawyers and social workers
 aapke pita shanti bhushan or bhai prashanth bhushan most powerful indians kii list main aa chuke hai
 In such a situation, where did the idea of entry in Bollywood go from family to isolation? Shefali: It is really a double-edged sword
 ek taraf to aise parivaar se aane par aapse apekshaayen jud jaati hai
 And in such a situation, if you are going to a different profession, then you know that what you have to do here is to do on your own because after failure, your return home is certain
 mere parivaar ne mujh par kabhi koi dabaav nahin banaaya
 Here we can choose profession according to our mind and family always stands together
 kya aap agali film kii taiyaari kar rahi hai?shefali:mere paas ek stair kii script taiyaar he
 i want to start working on it now
 ek musical film kii kahani bhi taiyaar he lekin usamen abhi vakt he
 i think the story calls you
 mujhako jis vakt jo kahani bulaaegi main wo film banaaungi
 On Monday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan gave his clarification after receiving praise from senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani
 unhone kaha ki adwani ne bijepi ke sabhi mantriyon kii tarif kii
 Shivraj said, 'advani also praised Modi and Raman Singh, i was third
 narendra modi or raman singh mujhase senior hai
 At the same time, BJP President Rajnath Singh says that LK Advani's statement was misunderstood
 jab adwani ne kii shivaraj singh chouhan kii tarifgauratlab he ki adwani ne madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se tulana karte hue donon ko ahankaar se pare bataaya, jabaki unhone vikaas ke liye shivaraj kii tulana gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se kii
 In the gestures, Shivraj Singh Chauhan was also said to be better than Modi
 adwani ne kaha tha ki gujarat pehle se hi ‘swasth’ rajya he or modi ne ise ‘shandaar’ rajya main badal diya lekin chouhan or chhattisgarh mukhyamantri raman singh bimaaru rajyon ko viksit rajya main badalane main safal rahe
 Advani had said, 'I tell Narendrabhai Modi that Gujarat was healthy even before
 aapane ise shandaar banaaya he or aap iske liye badhai ke paatr hai
 But what Chouhan and Chhattisgarh Chief Minister did is amazing
 ’vipakshiyon or apano ne bhi saadhaa nishanaadwani ke is bayaan ke baad congress ne bijepi kii khilli udaate hue kaha ki piem pad kii ummidavaari ke mudde par vipakshi dal main ‘grihayuddh’ chhidaa hua he
 At the same time, the Janata Dal United, an important constituent of the NDA, blossomed as if
 jediu khuleam adwani ke sur main sur milakar modi par nishaanaa saadhane main jute gai
 By resorting to the statement, the JDU also rejected Modi's claim of PM candidature

 After the successful launch of Chandrayaan-2, the second moon mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the whole world is amazed at the potential of Indian scientists
 sabhi desh is lonching kii khulkar tarif kar rahe hai
 Scientists from all over the world are now waiting for Chandrayaan-2 to reach the moon
 kyonki chand ke dakshini dhruv par abhi tak kisi bhi desh ne apana koi yaan nahin utaara he
 The information from there will be beneficial for many countries including India as well

 kyonki antariksh main prayog ke taur par bheji gai takanic kaa safal upyog baad main un satellites main kiya jaataa he jo sanchaar, mausam, aapadaa sambandhi hote hai
 Therefore, we want India and China to work together for the mission on the moon
 jaaniye
 
 
 What is the reason behind China's appeal? Zhang Kejian, chief of China's space agency China National Space Administration, said a few weeks ago that China plans to send manned missions to the moon's south pole by 2029-30 in the next 10 years
 Is making jabaki, bharat chand ke dakshini dhruv par moon mishan bhejne vaala pehla desh banane ke kareeb he
 In such a situation, when Chandrayaan-2 will give information from the south pole of the moon, it will be very useful for China
 china ko chandrayan-2 se mili soochnaaon se yah pataa chalegaa ki chand ke dakshini dhruv par vaataavaran kaisaa he, radiation kitna he or kis tarah vahaan roshni or andhere kaa aana-janaa hota he
 Thanks to all this information, China will make necessary changes in its human moon mission to be sent to the moon
 taaki chand ke dakshini dhruv par samay bitaane vaale uske antariksh yatriyon ko dikkat na ho
 The fourth country to make a soft landing on the lunar surface, India, Russia and China have been able to make soft landings on the surface of India

 China is confident that this mission of ISRO will be fully successful
 isliye vah agle moon mishan main bharat kaa sahyog chahta he
 However, China has only shown interest
 iske baad donon deshon ke videsh mantri isapar aapas main baat karenge
 The space agencies of the two countries will enter into an agreement if agreement is reached
 tab kahin jaakar puraa hoga china kaa bharat ke saath kaam karne kaa sapana

 In the petition, Sarabjit has said, "I have spent 22 years in jail for a crime that i did not commit
" '' lahore main 1990 main hue bam visphot main shaamil hone ke aarope main 49 varshiya sarbajit ko faansee kii sajaa mili thi
 One lakh people have signed the petition, urging Zardari to release Sarabjit on humanitarian grounds

 Bukhari has written in his letter, "sarabjit's release will serve to spread goodwill and communal harmony between the two countries
" ''sarbajit kii yachika se kuch hi din pehle bharat ke supreme court ne ajmer kii jail main band pakistani microbilogist 82 varshiya khalil chishti ko maanviya aadhaar par reeha karne kaa faisla diya tha

 Markandey Katju, President of the Press Council of India, also appealed to Zardari thrice to release Sarabjit, but the response has not been received yet
 katju ne purv pakistani seenetter saiyad faseeh ikbaal ko bhi is sandarbh main likhakar sarbajit kaa maamla haath main lene ko kaha tha

 Holding Sonia Gandhi responsible for the chaos created during the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi called her number 10
 modi kaa ishaara congress adhyaksh ke nivas sthaan 10 janpath kii taraf tha
 But the term 10 nambari is also used to refer to bullying
 abhi pichley dinon hi congress netaa or videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne modi ko napunsak kaha tha
 On this the next day Rahul Gandhi expressed his displeasure
 bijepi ne bhi raajnneetik sabhyataa kaa hawala diya tha
 It remains to be seen what this statement of Modi feeds
 karnataka ke gulberga ilaake main shuukravaar ko ek raily sambodhit karte hue gujarat ke mukhyamantri bole ki dekhie 10 numberi gandhi ne kya kiya andhra pradesh ke saath
 The Congress killed the mother along with the child
 unhone kaha ki bijepi bhi chaahati he ki telugana bane or simandhra bhi khub tarakkee kare
 But the Congress behaved like a doctor, who kills the mother only after being confused
 modi ne kaha ki ham maa or baccha, donon ko bachaana chaahate hai
