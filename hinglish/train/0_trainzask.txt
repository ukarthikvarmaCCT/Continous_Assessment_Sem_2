 After that the common people take a bath

 Illegal arms trade and smuggling in Delhi is being carried out indiscriminately
 police ise puri tarah se roak paane main naakaam sabit ho rahi he
 We are not saying this, but the Delhi Police figures themselves are testifying to this
 jinke mutabik saal 2018 main 1905 hathiyaar police ne jabt kiye hai
 Which is about 35 percent more than the year 2017
 darasal, saal 2018 main avaidh hathiyaaron se jude kul 1540 maamle darj hue
 In which 1901 people were arrested
 saath hi 1905 fire arms baraamad kiye gaye
 These figures are sufficient to show that large quantities of weapons are being captured in Delhi, cases are being registered and the accused are also being arrested
 lekin phir bhi bade paimaane par in hathiyaaron supplai ho rahi he
 Weapons are finally reaching the rogues, causing them to commit crimes
 yah bhi saaf he ki zyaadaatar baradam kiye gaye hathiyaar bihar ke munger or madhya pradesh ke dhar or khargon se laae gaye hai
 It is clear that the police is proving to be unable to completely destroy their network
 haalanki police ye bhi daawa kar rahi he ki aapraadhik ghatnaon main hathiyaaron kaa istemaal saal 2017 ke mukaable 2018 main kam hua
 According to the police, in the year 2017, there were 848 such cases, in which weapons were used
 jabaki saal 2018 main 752 maamle saamne aae hai
 But if we talk about the recovery of arms, somewhere in the year 2018, 35 percent more weapons have been recovered
 kya ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch main ho rahi kathith dhilaai main swasthya jepi nadda kaa koi role he? is par ek baar phir sawaal khadaa hua he
 The Delhi High Court has issued a notice to Union Health Minister JP Nadda and former AIIMS CVO Sanjeev Chaturvedi exposing corruption cases on a petition by the Center for Public Interest Litigation, ie CPIL
 donon hi logon ko is notice kaa jawaab vyaktigat taur par dena he
 Sanjeev Chaturvedi, who was the CVO of AIIMS, exposed several corruption cases, out of which 37 major cases were mentioned in the petition filed in the High Court
 in maamalon main ames ke diarector, dipti diarector administration or register samet kai bade adhikari jaanch ke ghere main hai
 During this period JP Nadda kept writing letters to the then Health Minister Dr
 Harsh Vardhan to remove Sanjeev Chaturvedi from the post of CVO of AIIMS and to close all these investigations
 jis par enditivi india ne tafsil se khabar dikhaai thi
 Last year, Chaturvedi was removed from the post of CVO and after some time Prime Minister Narendra Modi made JP Nadda the Health Minister, causing a lot of ruckus
 sipiem netaa mohammad saleem ne aaj court kii ore se jari kiye gaye notice ke baad kaha, 'ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon or unki jaanch main daali gai rukaawat kii modi sarkaar ne andekhi kii
 He made the culprit the only chancellor
 nadda sahab kaa swasthya mantri bananaa puri tarah galat tha
 This matter should be thoroughly investigated
 ' Now CPIL has demanded in its petition 1) - court sunishchit kare ki swasthya mantri nadda ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch main apane adhikaar kaa prayog na kar paayen
 2) - The investigation of all 37 major cases should be under the supervision of the High Court and a status report should be sought
 3)- sansadeey samiti kii ore se kii gai sifarish ke baad is maamle main nadda ke role ke bare main sibiai jaanch ho
 In this case, apart from Nadda and Chaturvedi, the High Court has also asked the Secretary of the Ministry of Health and the Chief Vigilance Officer, the Director of AIIMS, the Secretary of the CVC and the Director of the CBI to respond to the matter
 janalokapal bill se pani bijli bill par aane or phir congress se bina maange mili samarthan se dilli main sarkaar banane vaale arvind kejariwal ne beshak janalokapal bill ko mudda bana kar dilli kaa takht chhod diya ho, lekin bahut sari ummiido ko unhone nahin choda he
 In the same expectations, there is also the solidarity of non-communal forces and parties against communalism
 isamen congress ek dhuree sabit ho sakati he
 Especially when the party is struggling with anti-incumbency factor and finding it difficult to win the next election
 modi ko rokane ke liye party andi chotii kaa jor laga rahi ho
 But as soon as the Congress announced that the party from Varanasi would 'field a strong candidate under its flag', the Kejriwal camp suffered a setback
 koi bhi raajnneetik party apni ranneeti kaa khulaasa nahin karti, lekin kai baar maun rah kar apane anukool sthiti kaa intazaar karti he
 It is only Kejriwal's political ingenuity that by giving air to the issue of corruption, which first overtook the media and then the same corruption issue in politics, he has been seen to stand himself against communalism
 tabhi unhone apane ek bayaan main kah diya ki bhrashtachar se zyaada bada mudda sampradayikta he
 There is no doubt that communal politics is a very dangerous trend, but the reason behind Kejriwal's shift is something else
 dilli main congress ne kejariwal sarkaar ko samarthan dekar ek tir se do shikaar karnaa chaha
 To keep BJP away from power and expose it to the public about Kejriwal's impractical promises
 congress apane lakshya main kahaan tak kaamayaab rahi ye bahes kaa alag mudda he, lekin congress ke is samarthan ne kejariwal kii raajnneetik mahatvakanksha ko ek nayaa aayam de diya
 They started to believe that by standing against the enemy number one Modi of the Congress, they will gain the silent support of not only the Congress but also all the political parties that keep cursing Modi by drinking water
 raajnneeti main kehete hai na ki dushman kaa dushman dost hota he
 Under this formula, Kejriwal first made a statement to the leaders of his party for water testing that if Modi will fight against Varanasi then Kejriwal should fight against him
 jab modi kii varanasi kii ummidavaari tay ho gai tab bhi kejariwal ne sidhe taur par apni ummidavaari kaa elaan nahin kiya
 Said they will ask the people of Benaras
 bhartiya loktantr main aisa kabhi nahin hota ki janata chunaav ke pehle kisi kaa chunaav kare
 But as is the way of Kejriwal, he wants to be seen doing everything on the common man's shoulder
 to yahaan janata se poochne vaale bayaan kaa sidhaa matlab ye tha ki unhen thodaa time chahie
 Time because in the meantime, he should know about the Congress stance especially about his candidature
 unki ummid ko tab or hawa tab mili jab congress ke bade netaa or 10 janpath ke qareebi maane jane vaale anil shastri ne twit kar kaha ki agar bispi or espi modi ke khilaaf gambhir hai to unhen congress ke saath mil kar saajha ummidavaar tay karnaa chahie
 In the same tweet, when asked if he would like 'congress and Aam Aadmi Party should join hands to save the country from communal forces', he replied' Yes I agree
 ' When asked about the Congress party, the party said that Anil Shastri is talking about a broader scenario, not a seat in Varanasi
 modi ko haraane ke liye congress kejariwal ke sahare daanv khel sakati thi jiskaa ishaara anil shastri ne dilli main or reeta bahuguna joshi ne lakhanu main kiya tha
 However, the party feared that by doing so, Kejriwal, as a secular leader, would get such a boost due to which the Congress would lose its land of secularism
 kejariwal ko dilli main sarkaar banane ke liye samarthan dene ke faisle par party netaaon ke jis kheme naakushi jataayi thi unke ek baar phir naaraaz hone kaa khatara bhi party ne mahasoos kiya
 BJP would also get a chance to beat the rhythm that what she has been saying proved to be true, Kejriwal is the b team of the Congress
 yahi vajah he ki congress ne varanasi ke nattejey par zyaada na sochate hue ek majboot ummidavaar dene ko qamar kas lee he
 This is no less than a shock to Kejriwal's expectations

 The 'nirbhaya Fund' for the safety of women has been said to create a Nirbhaya Fund for the safety of women, for which 1 thousand crore rupees will be given
 pi
 Sonia Gandhi and Sushma Swaraj thumped the table a lot on Chidambaram's announcement
 dilli gangrape kii vaardaat ke baad mahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar sawaal uthaa the
 It was also mentioned in the budget speech of the Finance Minister

 Trying to honor 'half the population'
 chidambaram ke bajet ne middle class kaa dil tod diya, lekin aadhi aabaadi ke liye tijori kholkar mahilaon kaa dil jeetne kii bharpoor koshish kii

 At the time Chidambaram was announcing this, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj had a smile on their faces
 'madam' videsh se sona laaengi duty frivitt mantri ne mahilaon ko ek or tohfa diya
 Women will now bring gold with them when they come from abroad, then it will be duty free
 yani ab mahilaayein videsh jaakar jamkar gahanon kii khariddaari kar sakengi
 Of course a lot came out of Chidambaram's box for women, but if they had announced tax exemption for women too, gold would have become icing on the cake

 smarak banane kii sanak ko lekar badal sarkaar kii kaaphi aalochana bhi ho rahi he
 Critics say the state government is debt-ridden (1,13,070 crore in 2015

 However, his political opponents are refraining from criticizing these monuments

 In this case, the Aam Aadmi Party is talking more practical
 punjab main party ke pravaktaa chander sut dogra kehete hai, ''behatar hota, yah sara paisa janata par kharch hota
 Instead of building a grand war memorial, a much larger tribute would have been spent on the widows and parents of the martyrs

 The team investigating Baba's ashrams are also surprised to know what things were filled in the mind of Baba Virendra Dev Dixit, accused of spreading hypocrisy in the name of spiritual university
 kya aap yakeen karenge ki virendra dev dikshit apane ashram main rahane vaali ladakiyon ko apane paas bulaane ke liye naa sirf unhen ajeebogarib naseehaten diya karata tha, balki inhen ladakiyon se apane liye pyaar kaa percentage bhi maangata tha
 According to the Delhi Women's Commission, many such objectionable things are recorded in the documents received from the ashram, which is not appropriate to mention openly
 ayyashi kii uniwarsity ke sabase bade chancelar yanibaba virendra dev dikshitke mukhaarvind se nikle gyaan ganga kii ek baangi dekhie ki ye baba nai umr kii jawan ladakiyon ko bure sapanom se bachane ke liye kya or kisi naseehat detaa tha
 He used to tell the girls' sleep with the father, not alone
 akele sote ho naa, tabhi swapn aate hai
 If you sleep with the father, you can never have such dreams
 'ab isi baba ji ke gyaan kii duusari jhalak dekhie ki kaise wo hazaron jawan betiyon kaa swayambhu baap ban kar unhen lav main percentage baantne kaa tareeqa sikhaata rahaa
 He tells the girls, 'if there is any connection between anything and your body, then surely there is a percentage of love in the Father, to erase your belongingness, to bring the Father's likeness in yourself
 do mukhya baaten lakshya rup main saamne rakhni hai
 One is love, the other is love
 jo jitna lavali hoga, wo utana hi lavalin rah saktaa he
 'finally, fall down from all limits and see another proof of this Baba's dirty spirit
 jin ladakiyon ko wo ab tak duniya ke saamne apni beti bataane kaa dhong rachataa rahaa, unheen ladakiyon ke liye uske dimaag main kya or kisi baaten bhari thim 'bahut kumariyaan bhi badi gandi hoti hai
 No matter how much i explain, i don't understand
 bas, pine kii taat lagi rahati he
 The chanting goes on, the pee, the same thinking goes on
 aise-aise bhi hai
 "hearing it can be difficult to believe
 dimaag sunn pad jaae
 The ears are tingling
 magar afsos ki jab tak ankhon par padaa andhvishwaas kaa jhina nahin hota, ye sari kii sari baaten kaanon main to aati hai, lekin dimaag main nahin aati
 That is why not a one-two, ten-twenty or twenty-five, but thousands of people, like the disease of Mass hysteria, go to sleep in a tantrum by taking them to the camp of such bastards to teach spiritual lessons to their daughters
 udhar, baba maa-baap ke bharose kaa qatl kar maasoom or kamasin ladakiyon ke saath vogul khilaataahe ki jab tak inaki pole khulti he, tab tak hazaron ladakiyon kii aabru taar-taar ho chuki hoti hai, zindagiyaan barbaad ho chuki hoti hai
 If you do not believe, then listen to the statement of Swati Maliwal, Chairman of the Delhi Women's Commission, who with her own eyes saw such things in the ashram of this Baba Virendra Dev Dixit that it was difficult for her to believe her own eyes
 virendra dev dikshit ke ashram main ladakiyon ko bandhak bana kar unke saath zyaadati kiye jane kii shikaayatein to lambey samay se aa rahi thim
 But the fact is that our police never took these complaints as seriously as they should have
 nateeja, kanoon kii naak ke neeche desh kii rajdhani main ayyashi kii uniwarsity main har rose ek nai eent judati rahi or har rose paap kii imaarat kai eench oonchi hoti rahi
 But after the High Court order and the intervention of Delhi Women's Commission, now hundreds of girls who are being held hostage in different ashrams of this Baba are getting free, such things and documents are being found in these ashrams in the name of spirituality
 Let us witness the torture
 or to or upar kii ye panktiyaan bhi baba virendra dev dikshit ke unheen pravachan vaali kitabon kaa hissaa hai, jinase wo sadhviyon ke bich gyaan baanta karata tha
 Actually, this Baba used to call himself God
 apni tulana bhagwaan krishna se bhi karata tha or bholi-bhali ladakiyon ko unheen bhagwaan krishna kii 16 hazaar raniyaan bataa kar jab usne zyaadati karata tha, to chaah kar bhi bahut si ladkiyaan apana munh nahin khol paati thim
 But now the time has changed
 ladkiyaan bol rahi he, kilanuma ashram ke taale tuutane lage hai or mauka bhaanp kar baba faraar ho chukaa he

 The film has been directed by Remo d'souza and has worked with many legendary stars
 salmaan khan ke alaava actor bobi deol, anil kapur, daiji shah or jacleen furnandis film main ahm kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai
 Abhay Ram wakes up early in the morning and reaches a small gaushala near his home in Saifai village in Etawah district in Uttar Pradesh
 70 saal se upar ke ye bujurgavaar vahaan kai ghante bitaate hai or apane saamne gaayon ko nahalaane, chaara khilaane or unhen duhane ke kaam kii nigaraanee karte hai
 Unperturbed by the smell of cow dung, they sleep in the afternoon in the cowshed
 saifai main ab yah jhonpadi hi bachi he, jo unhen puraane dinon kii yaad dilaati he
 Abhay Ram is the father of Badaun MP Dharmendra Yadav and younger brother of Samajwadi Party (SP) President Mulayam Singh Yadav
 mulaayam singh kaa chunaav kshetra hone kii vajah se yah gaanv pichley do dashakon main kisi registan main nachlistaan jaisaa ban gaya he
 The land here used to be barren, where the soil was sour
 lekin saifai ab chamak gaya he, jahaan vigyaan kii aadhunik prayogshaalaon se las teen behtareen skool hai or 65 acre main failaa ek degree college he, jisamen digital sound system vaala auditorium he
 There is an 800-bed hospital here, where around 5,00,000 patients are treated every year
 saifai main estrotarf vaala spotrs college or hawaii pattee bhi he
 There are so many facilities here for a population of only 7,000 and about 5,000 employees from outside
 yah mulaayam ke apane paitruk gaanv ke liye kisi tohfe se kam nahin he
 Problems such as electricity, drinking water, toilets, roads, schools and unemployment continue to haunt the common man in the rest of India's villages, but some villages like Saifai that flourish in political patronage have become the exception
 in ilaakon ko khwaabon ke shahar kii tarah bhavyata ke saath viksit kiya gaya he, jahaan kuchhek sau meter kii duuri par sari buniyadi suvidhaayen maujuud hai
 Today such magnificent places can be seen all over the country
 khaas baat yah ki desh main is tarah ke kuch gine-chune gaanvon kaa vikaas kshetreey kshatrapon ke adheen hua he
 The reason for such development is due to the attachment of the Kshatrapas to their village to some extent, so the feeling of some service has also been a reason
 lekin is vikaas ke peeche mukhya vajah apana rajnatik garh banane kii hi rahi he taaki koi unhen vahaan se haraa na sake, bhale hi kisi kii lahar ho yaa na ho
 The development of these places is in stark contrast to the condition of the surrounding areas, which shows how crippled the sense of selfishness among our leaders is
 maharashtra main sharad pavaar ke kshetra baraamati kii kahani bhi bilkul aisi hi he
 This area was once desolate, but today it has become suitable for cultivation, where sugarcane, pomegranate, grapes, banana, sorghum and millet are being cultivated
 sinchai ke liye nira nadi par bane vir baandh se 60 kimi lambii nahar banaakar pani laayaa gaya he
 Bathinda in Punjab is also an example, which has been developed by Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal's family after his daughter-in-law Harsimrat Kaur was elected MP in 2009
 yahaan bekaar padi jhil ke kinare bhavy mal khadaa kar diya gaya he
 Despite facing a financial crunch, the state government has given Rs 3,295 crore to the sector in the last five years
 muhaiyaa karaae hai
 The story of Rohtak of Haryana is also similar
 yah jila rajya ke mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda or unke saansad bete deepender kii chhatrachhaaya main desh kii primary shiksha or udyogon kaa centre ban gaya he
 Asian Paints, Amul Dairy, Suzuki Motorcycle and Nippon Carbide have spent Rs 5,000 crore each in the last three years in the city's Industrial Model Town
 kaa investment kiya he
 Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh is one such example
 yahaan bhi suryavanshi mills or remand jaisi companiyaan baari-bharkam investment kar chuki hai
 This district is becoming the center of BPO under the umbrella of Union Minister Kamal Nath
 is tarah ke kshetron ke vikaas ke peeche kahani ek hi he
 Either a leader's family is in state power, or the leader of that region holds his political position in the central government and can influence policy decisions as he wishes
 netaaon ke is tarah ke kaam karne kii vajahen chaahe jo bhi hon, is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki in vishisht kshetron ke nivaasiyon kaa jivan behatar hua he
 For example, Saifai today has become a center of education, health and sports for people living within a radius of 150 km
 vahaan ke logon ko in suvidhaon ke liye ab agra yaa kanpur kaa rukh karne kii jarurat nahin padati
 Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav says, "to say that this is a family project proves to be absolutely wrong
 dekhie, sirf saifai ke aspataal se kitne logon ko phayda mil rahaa he
 ”dipendra also makes similar claims about Rohtak
 unka kahana he ki unhone apane nirvachan kshetra ke liye ek nayaa akhil bhartiya ayurvigyaan santhaan (ames) hasil kar liya he
 But VIP areas like Amethi and Rae Bareli are lagging far behind in terms of development despite getting large projects due to the Gandhi family
 raibareli main kareeb 20,000 karod ru
 Investments have taken place, which include modernization of projects and some new projects
 inamen 2012 main sthapit rail coach factory bhi shaamil he
 Similarly in Amethi, especially Jagdishpur Industrial Area, about Rs 10,000 crore
 kaa investment hua he
 But the local people have not benefited from these investments
 raibareli main modi karpats, upi state spinning company or wespa car company samet kam se kam 15 badi factoriyaan bijli or duusari buniyadi sevaaon kii kami kii vajah se pichley 15 saal main band ho chuki hai
 According to the District Labor Department, more than half the small scale industries have almost lost their business
 amethi main pichley 15 saal main ushaa steel or aarif cements samet kam se kam chah factoriyaan inhen samasyaon kii vajah se band ho chuki hai
 There is no doubt that the development in real India will change the picture of development in the country, not just in the metros
 lekin badlaav kii ichha rakhane vaale netaa desh ke baaki hisson ko besahaara chhodkar sirf apane hi nirvachan kshetron kaa vikaas kar rahe hai or unhen vikaas model banane main lage hai
 The general sector mps get only 5 crore rupees a year for development
 par hi ashrith hai
 Nobody cares about them

 salaami ballebaaj shikhar dhawan ke shandaar shatak or murali vijay ke saath unki pehle wicket kii 239 ran kii atoot saajhedaari se bharat ne bangladesh ke khilaaf ekmaatr cricket test ke barish se prabhavit pehle din bina wicket khoe 239 ran banaae
 Taking full advantage of the opportunity given to him by the sickness of Lokesh Rahul, who scored a century in the Sydney Test, Dhawan dominated from the beginning and scored an unbeaten 150-run stand with the help of 21 fours in 158 balls
 salaami ballebaaj vijay ne dhawan kaa acha saath nibhaate hue vipareet andaaj main 178 gend main naabad 89 ran banaae
 Indian openers did not face much trouble in today's 56-over game, which led to the decision of captain Virat Kohli to win the toss and bat first
 dhawan or vijay ne test cricket main duusari baar 200 ran se adhik kii saajhedaari kii he
 Earlier, they had shared a 289-run partnership in Mohali in 2013
 donon ballebaajon ne shuru se hi sakaaratmak gendbaaji kii or mejabaan team ke gendbaajon ke khilaaf aasaani se ran jutaaye
 On a slow and flat pitch, Bangladesh's quartet of spinners faced trouble
 saaqib al hasan (nau over main bina wicket ke 34 ran), taijul islam (12 over main bina wicket ke 55 ran), shuvagata home (13 over main bina wicket ke 47 ran) or juber hossain (saat over main bina wicket ke 41 ran) bhartiya gendbaajon ko svachhand hokar ballebaaji karne se rokane main naakaam rahe
 Dhawan, however, got his life in the 24th over of the innings before the rain disrupted when Shuvagata, off left-arm spinner Taizul, dropped his easy catch at short mid-wicket
 baayen haath ke ballebaaj dhawan us vakt 73 ran bankaar khel rahe the
 The game was halted for about four hours due to rain
 khel dobaaraa shuru hone par ek baar phir donon ballebaaj lay main dikhe
 Vijay completed the half-century with a four over fast bowler Mohammad Shahid
 dhawan ne taijul par chauke ke saath 90 ran ke score ko paar kiya
 After this Dhawan slowed down a bit, but he completed his third Test century with a four over Jubeir
 duusari taraf vijay ne dhimi shuruyaat kii
 When Dhawan hit a half-century in just 47 balls with a four over Shuvagata, he was playing only 11 runs
 vah haalanki din kaa khel aage badhane ke saath lay main aa gaye or unhone kuch aakshark shaat lagaae
 The hosts' decision to land with four specialist spinners and the only fast bowler proved to be wrong and Dhawan had no problem in scoring runs
 unhone shahid kii short gendon ko aasaani se pul kiya jab spinneron par bhi aasaani se ran batore
 Dhawan hit the first four of the innings by sending Soumya Sarkar's ball for four runs in the fourth over of the innings
 unhone iske baad shahid kii gend ko bhi boundry ke darshan karaae
 Delhi's left-handed batsman Dhawan welcomed Shuvagata with two consecutive fours
 tippaniyan Vijay, however, preferred to rotate the strike and held one end
 dhawan ne jab shuvagata kii gend par let cat se chaukaa jadkar ardhashatak puraa kiya to captain kohli or team nideshak ravi shastri ne bhi taaliyaan bajaakar unke pradarshan kii saraahna kii
 Bangladesh chief spinner Saqib did not look effective during the first spell and bowled several loose balls
 unki phultos ko vijay ne chaar ran ke liye bhi bheja
 The decision to drop their fastest bowler, Rubel Hossain, prevailed over Bangladesh as Shahid, the only fast bowler in the playing XI, did not have the variety and pace to upset the Indian opening pair
 sidney test main shatak jadne vaale lokesh rahul ke biimaar hone se mili maukey kaa puraa phayda uthaate hue dhawan ne shuruyaat se hi dabadabaa banaate hue 158 gend main 21 chaukon kii madad se naabad 150 ran kii pari kheli
 Opener Vijay, playing well with Dhawan, scored 89 not out off 178 balls in the opposite style
 aaj hue 56 over ke khel main bhartiya salaami ballebaajon kaa adhik pareshaani kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa, jisase captain viraat kohli kaa toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji karne kaa faisla sahi sabit hua
 Dhawan and Vijay have shared more than 200 runs for the second time in Test cricket
 isse pehle in donon ne 2013 main mohali main 289 ran kii saajhedaari kii thi
 Both batsmen bowled positively from the start and scored runs easily against the bowlers of the hosts
 dhimi or sapaat pich par bangladesh kii spinneron kii chaukadi ko pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Saqib Al Hasan (34 runs without wickets in nine overs), Taizul Islam (55 runs without wickets in 12 overs), Shuvagata Home (47 runs without wickets in 13 overs) and Zubeer Hussain (41 wickets in seven overs) Runs) failed to stop Indian bowlers from batting free
 dhawan ko haalanki pari ke 24wein over main barish ke khalal se pehle jeevandaan mila, jab baayen haath ke spinner taijul kii gend par shuvagata ne short mid wicket par unka aasaan kaich tapakaa diya
 Left-handed batsman Dhawan was playing 73 runs at the time
 barish ke kaaran lagbhag chaar ghante tak khel rukaa rahaa
 Once the game resumed, both batsmen once again looked in rhythm
 vijay ne tej gendbaaj mohammad shahid par chauke ke saath ardhashatak puraa kiya
 Dhawan crossed the score of 90 with a four on Taizul
 iske baad dhawan kuch dhime pad gaye, lekin juber par chauke saath unhone apana teesraa test shatak puraa kiya
 Vijay, on the other hand, started off slow
 dhawan ne shuvagata par chauke ke saath jab sirf 47 gend main ardhashatak puraa kiya tab vah sirf 11 ran banaakar khel rahe the
 He, however, got into rhythm as the day's game progressed and he made some attractive shots
 mejabaan team kaa chaar visheshgy spinneron or ekmaatr tej gendbaaj ke saath utarane kaa faisla galat sabit hua or dhawan ko ran batorne main koi pareshaani nahin hui
 He easily pulled Shahid's short balls when scoring runs easily on the spinners as well
 dhawan ne pari ke chauthe over main saumy sarkaar kii gend ko cover drive se chaar ran ke liye bhejkar pari kaa pehla chaukaa jadaa
 After this, he also saw the boundary of Shahid's ball
 dilli ke baayen haath ke ballebaaj dhawan ne shuvagata kaa swaagat lagaataar do chaukon ke saath kiya
 The comments vijay ne haalanki strike rotate karne ko tarjeeh di or ek chor sanbhale rakhaa
 Captain Dhali and team director Ravi Shastri also praised his performance when Dhawan completed the half-century with a late cut off Shuvagata's ball
 bangladesh ke mukhya spinner saaqib pehle spel ke dauraan prabhavi nahin dikhe or unhone kai dhili gend phenki

 Pakistan has arrested Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the Mumbai terror attack, after being surrounded by terrorism all over the world
 haalanki uski yah karrwai aatanki hafiz said ko sajaa dilaane yaa aatankwaad ko khatm karne ke liye nahin he, balki duniya kii aankh main dhul jhonkne ke liye he
 Pakistan's own diplomat has been exposed by a former diplomat
 britain main pakistan ke purv rajanyik waajid shamsul hasan ne bataaya ki hafiz said kii giraftaar mahaj dikhaava he
 The fact of it is that Pakistan has arrested Hafiz Saeed, the terrorist's boss, to mislead the world
 britain main pakistan ke hai kamishnar rahe waajid shamsul hasan ne 'surkhiyaan' naamak news portal main 'hafiz said kii giraftaar kii kahani ke peeche kii kahani' sheershak se lekh likhaa he
 In it, he wrote that the arrest of jamaat-ud-dawa kingpin Hafiz Saeed for the ninth time was a ploy to make Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to Washington a success
 purv pakistani rajanyik ne kaha ki hafiz said kii giraftaar kii khabar saamne aate hi america ke raashtrapati donald trump ne fouran twit kar diya
 He called the arrest of global terrorist Hafiz Saeed a huge success
 waajid shamsul hasan ne apane lekh main kaha ki pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan apni sarkaar kii kharaab chhavi ko sudhaarney kii koshish kar rahe hai
 However, the fact is that his home minister Ejaz Ahmad Shah is the retiring brigadier of ISI
 un par kai aatanki sanghathanon ke saath gupachup tareeke se milane kaa bhi aarope he
 In addition, Ejaz Ahmad Shah is accused of harboring Omar Saeed Sheikh, who abducted journalist Denier Pearl
 is maamle main wo washington main sandigdh hai
 Let us tell you that Hafiz Saeed has been declared a global terrorist by the United Nations and America
 yah pehali baar nahin he, jab mumbai hamale ke aatanki hafiz said ko pakistan main giraftaar kiya gaya he
 Even before this, he has been arrested many times
 haalanki usko har baar chhod diya gaya
 India has also provided Pakistan with evidence against Hafiz Saeed in the Mumbai terror attack, but each time Pakistan pretends to arrest Hafiz Saeed
 iske baad vah usko reeha kar detaa he
 The Minister of Agriculture has been stuck answering a question in Parliament on the issue of farmer suicides

 11 people were killed in the February 28, 2002 massacre
 is maamle main bijepi kii purv mantri maaya kodenani mukhya aaropee hai
 Maya Kodnani had submitted an application last month seeking 14 witnesses including BJP national president Amit Shah
 vishesh court ne unki yah maang maan lee he or inhen saman jari karne kii manjuuri di he
 Now Maya Kodnani, the prime accused in this case, will be able to call BJP chief Amit Shah as a witness and question him
 amit shah se poochtacha main maaya kodenani ye sabit karnaa chaahati hai ki ve ghatana ke din ghatnasthal par nahin thim balki, gujarat vidhansabha bhawan, sola civil hospital, asarava main apane nursing home or asarava civil hospital main thim
 According to her, she also met Amit Shah in the Assembly and Sola Civil Hospital, which could prove that she was there
 yah kaha ja rahaa he ki kodenani or shah samet kai netaa us din sola civil aspataal gaye the jahaan sabarmati train hatyakand main maare gaye logon ke shav laae gaye the
 Many months are surprised by this application of Kodnani after several months after the SIT probing the list of 80 witnesses in the special court
 is maamle main mohammad saleem samet kareeb darjanabhar gavaahon ne gavaahi di he ki maaya kodenani us din ghatnasthal par maujuud thim

 peediton ke vakil shamashaad pathan kaa aarope he ki maaya kodenani jaanboojhkar aisi raajnneetik hasti ko gavaah bana rahi hai jisase puure cese par asar daalaa ja sake
 However, Kodnani's lawyer Amit Patel has denied these allegations and says Maya Kodnani has full legal authority to cross-examine any witness in her defense
 tippaniyan Maya Kodnani has already been convicted in the Naroda Patia murder case and has been sentenced to life imprisonment
 haalanki swasthya kaarnon se pichley do saalon se jamaanat par baahar hai
 But if Amit Shah comes to the rescue of Maya Kodnani, he will be seen opposing the SIT which belongs to the government and according to the charge sheet, Maya Kodnani is an accused
 ab is maamle kii pramukh aaropee maaya kodenani bijepi pramukh amit shah ko bataur gavaah bulaakar unase poochtacha kar paaengi
 In interrogation of Amit Shah, Maya Kodnani wants to prove that she was not at the scene on the day of the incident but at her nursing home and Asarwa Civil Hospital at Gujarat Assembly Building, Sola Civil Hospital, Asarwa
 unke mutabik ve vidhansabha or sola civil hospital main amit shah se bhi mili bhi thim jisase yah sabit ho saktaa he ki ve vahaan thim
 It is being said that many leaders including Kodnani and Shah went to Sola Civil Hospital on that day where the bodies of those killed in the Sabarmati train massacre were brought
 vishesh court main jaanch kar rahi esaiti ne 80 gavaahon kii list darj karwaane ke kai maheenon baad kodenani kii is arji se kai logon ko aashcharya ho rahaa he
 About a dozen witnesses, including Mohammad Salim, have testified in the case that Maya Kodnani was present at the scene that day

 Shamshad Pathan, the lawyer for the victims, alleges that Maya Kodnani is deliberately witnessing such a political figure to influence the entire case

 Because people are being lame due to pellet gun

 ab janata ke swabhaav main or zyada badlaav kii jarurat he
 He said that the mood of the people is also changing
 wo kaam kar rahe hai
 Much has changed, but much remains to be done
 lekhak ho janaa bukhaar pakadaney jaise hota he
 Unless three or four people look at the color and declare that you have become a writer, then you cannot believe it and if you believe it, then you do not understand how everything happened? It is a disease that someone thought he had
 " lekhakon ke saamne badi mushkil hoti he khud ko lekhak maanane kii
 The world keeps saying but from inside it is difficult to convince ourselves that a writer has been made
 aisi paristhiti main daad deni hogi un lekhakon ke hausale kii jo hathi-cheentee or santa-banta se aage nikalate hi nemplate par lekhak likhaa lete hai
 But the real writer never calls himself a writer
 bhala bataaie koi maanavtaa par agle kuch saalon tak kahar dhane kaa jugad kar ke aayaa ho to kaise apane munh miyaan mitthu ban jaae?sach to ye he ki lekhak hameshaa ek aparaadhbabodh liye jeeta he
 Even if printed or not
 chhapane ke baad ye aparadhbodh ki chhapane laayak tha bhi? or na chape to ye uljhan ki chhapane laayak kya nahi? paise milane par lagata he ki apane likhe ko bech daalaa or paise na mili to ye kuntha ki do kaudi bhar kii puch nahin
 If you write well, you get elation and if you write bad, you get taunted
 sachcha lekhak vahi hota he jo paison kii chintaa kiye bina likhe
 Such writers are very much needed by the society
 ham sampadak samaaj kii baat kar rahe hai
 Any writer regrets two things
 pehla ye ki ab kaa likhaa pard wo sochataa he ki pehle jaise kyon nahin likh paata or pehle kaa likhaa pard le to is soch main pad jaataa he ki aakhir usne itnaa bura likhaa hi kyon?lekhak sabase kamjor tab hote hai jab wo baaten kar rahe hon or sabase shaktishaalee tab jab vichaar kar rahe hon
 Who else could be worse than the writer? Family Writer
 unhen to pataa bhi nahin hota ki is janm ke paapon kaa fal bhugat rahe hai yaa purv janmon ke? lekhak acha ho yaa bura marakar nark hi jaataa he kyonki swarg main devtaa unhen fatakane hi nahin dete
 Don't know when to run a pen on them too? But writers' wives always go to Baikunth
 nark 'bas is artical kaa paisa aane do' sunate-sunate bhugat leti hai or swarg ke sukh unke liye bemaani ho jate hai
 Those women who are about to marry a self-respecting writer
 is chhbbees janvari hathi par baith veerta puraskaar paane kii adhikarini hai
 Troubled writers are not the only ones
 na wo lekhak jo padhe nahin ja rahe yaa phir na wo lekhak jinhen mohalle kaa pansaari tak nahi pahachaanata
 Those writers who are looking good writing and printing are also upset
 koi kah de aap phalane sa likhte hai to moulik na rah paane kaa bhay or koi kah de dhikaane sa likhte hai to ye khatka sone nahin detaa ki itnaa bura kab se likhane lage?usase bhi bura lagata he,apane likhe ko duusare ke naam se padhakar
 Words leave such an impact that the writer leaves
 lekhak se ummid kii jaati he ki wo kabhi apane likhe par or kaa naam dekhakar shikaayat na kare kyonki wo bada lekhak he
 It is just like this that you want to become a big man, in return, tell the whole neighborhood your child
 (yuva vyangyakaar ashish mishra peshey se ejeeniyar hai or indore main rahete hai
 ) saal 1984 ke sikh danga maamle main umrakaid kii sajaa kaat rahe congress ke purv netaa sajjan kumaar ko somvaar ko jail prashasan ne dilli ke patiala house court main pesh kiya
 This time he was presented in the Sultanpuri Sikh riot case involving since 1984
 somvaar ko is maamle main us gavaah kaa sajjan kumaar ke vakil ne cross ejamination kiya, jisane kuch hi dinon pehle sajjan kumaar ko bhari court main pahachaanaa tha
 This witness says that Sajjan Kumar had instigated people, after which his son and father were killed by the mob
 ye gavaah koi or nahin cham cor he
 On Monday, Sajjan Kumar's lawyers sought some more time for Cham Kaur's cross examination, after which the court gave the next date of February 4 in the case
 ab 4 farvari ko gavaah cham cor kaa dobaaraa cross ejamination hoga
 In the previous hearing, the court had issued a production warrant to present Sajjan Kumar
 saal 1984 ke sultanpuri sikh danga maamle kii ahm gavaah cham cor kaa somvaar takreeban aadhe ghante tak cross ejamination karne ke baad sajjan kumaar ke vakeelon ne court se kaha ki isi maamle main cham cor ne 1987 or 1991 main apana bayaan darj karaayaa tha
 Sajjan Kumar's lawyers said that Cham Kaur did not give a statement to the police about the son's death at that time
 lihaaja, purana bayaan unke paas nahin he
 He has applied for this in the High Court and is expected to get a copy of Cham Kaur's statement by 30 January
 purana bayaan aane ke baad ek baar phir wo cross ejamination karnaa chahenge
 After hearing the arguments of Sajjan Kumar's lawyers, the court deferred hearing of the case for 4 February
 sajjan kumaar ke vakil anil sharma ne cham cor se cross ejamination ke dauraan kai sawaal puche or aarope lagaae ki 14 november 1984 ko jab pehali baar cham cor ne dangon par police ko bayaan diya tha, to usamen unhone kabhi bhi police se ye nahin kaha ki unke pita or bete kii hatya hui thi
 In response to this question by Sajjan Kumar's lawyer, Cham Kaur said that he had told the police that his father and son were killed, but he is not well educated and he is not aware of what the police did
 haalanki ye jarur he ki unhone police ko jaise hi kaha ki unke pita or bete kii hatya hui he, to police ne kagajaat par kuch likhaa tha
 Let us tell you that Cham Kaur is an important witness in the 1984 Sultanpuri riot case

 Inspired by the unique waves of faith, these calls are coming for Chintaman Ganesh himself, whose innovative devotees have found an easy way of mobile phones to convey their heart to God in this era of Bhagadori

 Rationalists can undoubtedly question the practice of devotees calling God
 lekin bhav-bhakthi ke is ajab-gajab samvaad ke taar aasthaa kii dilachasp kahaniyon se jude hai
 Ashok Pathak, the priest of the temple, said, his devotees have been writing letters to Chintaman Ganesh for almost four decades
 magar sanchaar ke hitech yug main varsh 2005 se bhakton ne bhagwaan tak apni muraadein pahunchane ke liye mobile phone kaa sahaara lenaa shuru kar diya

 According to Pathak, devotees of Ganesh talk to him like an intimate friend for a long time and open their heart to God
 unhone bataaya ki is ganeshotsav main aise bhakton kii taadaad zyada he, jo bhagwaan se acchhee shiksha or badhiya pagaar vaali naukari dilaane kii dua maang rahe hai

 mandir ke pujari ashok pathak ne bataaya, vaise chintaman ganesh ko unke bhakt kareeb chaar dashak se chitthiyaan likh rahe hai
 But in the high-tech era of communication, from the year 2005, devotees started using mobile phones to bring their wishes to God

 Pathak tells that the unique tradition of calling Viraje Chintaman Ganesh in a 1,200-year-old Parmarakala temple began when a devotee hailing from Indore settled in Germany
 yah bhakt hajaaron mile ke faasale se bhagwaan ko niyamit taur par chitthiyaan likhaa karata tha

 pehali baar vidhayak bane sorain ke bete hemanth sorain ko up-mukhyamantri kaa pad saunpa gaya
 But many JMM mlas, including Soren's b Sita, are angry over the lack of anything
 munda sarkaar ko apana samarthan dene kii evaj main ageesu, jhamumo or nirdaleey vidhayak bordon or nigamon main apane hisse ke liye chatapata rahe hai, lekin munda ne koi niyukti nahin kii he, kyonki in padon ko lekar khaastaur par jhamumo main vidhayakon or party ke padaadhikariyon main koi aam sahmati nahin he
 While the pressure of his colleagues remains equal, Munda has taken some important steps forward
 30 agast ko jharkhand electronic tareeke se sevaayen muhaiyaa karaane ke liye kanoon banane vaala desh kaa pehla rajya ban gaya
 The Electronic Services Provision Bill, 2011 provides for the provision of certificates such as Income, Caste, Residence and Permanent Resident Certificate from the Internet by the State Government
 isi din jharkhand ne seva kaa adhikaar vidheyak bhi paarit kiya he, jo ek nishchit samay seemaa ke bheetar nagarikon ko seva pradaan karne ke liye sarkari adhikariyon ko jimmedaar tehraata he
 After Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Jharkhand is the fourth state in the country to pass this milestone bill
 ve mukhyamantri ko lokapal ke daayre main laane ke paksh main hai, iske saath hi ve bhrashton kii sampatti jabt karne sareekhee takat bhi lokapal ko dene kii baat kehete hai
 Munda is clearly taking advantage of public opinion by assuring him to take action against corruption, in view of public resentment towards the five former jailed ministers
 ve thodaa jaldi main najar aate hai
 While they are visiting the state to keep an eye on the delivery system, they also plan to have call centers operating round the clock and seven days to keep in touch with the people
 to kya sarkaar is laayak bhi he, ki uske liye itani jahamat uthaai jaae? bhaajapa is vyavastha ko banaae hue he, kyonki vah jharkhand main congress-jhavimo gathbandhan ko walkover dena nahin chaahati
 a top BJP leader in Bihar says that the good news for the BJP is that Munda has acted despite this
 ve maanate hai ki munda ko jin paristhitiyon se ulajhne ke liye chhod diya gaya he, unase sirf ve hi nipat sakate hai
 Munda is also going to have to make extra efforts to satisfy his allies — for example, JMM chief Shibu Soren being conferred with cabinet rank
 zyada dabaav padane par munda ne apane sahyogiyon ko do-took bataa diya ki jahaan tak sarkaar chalane kii baat he, ve 'satr dar satr' soch rahe hai
 Meaning that they will not bear undue pressure to run the government
 munda ko saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he, kyonki anishchit shibu sorain-bhaajapa ke hi baraabar 18 vidhayakon kii sankhya ke saath-apane haath kholane se baj nahin aaenge
 a few days ago, he took up the issue of the chief minister's post in turn — which was rejected by the BJP — the JMM supremo never misses an opportunity to trouble the Munda government
 sorain kaa taaja hamalaa yah tha ki bhaajapa alpsankhyakon ke saath bhedbhaav kar rahi he, jiske kaaran munda ko kai kadam uthaane pade the
 And after all, Munda also has his own party colleagues like Deputy Chief Minister and senior BJP leader Raghubar Das
 munda ko gathbandhan main uthte oonche-neeche suron ko niyantrit karne ke liye bhale hi chaturaai bharaa santulan baithaana padataa ho, lekin jharkhand kii paristhitiyon ne nishchit taur par unke kad main ijapha kiya he
 Starting with an alternate Chief Minister, who was considered a caretaker Chief Minister after the ouster of Babulal Marandi in 2003 under pressure from five JD (U) ministers, besides making a place for himself in Munda State politics, the BJP has the most He emerged as a tribal leader
 sanyogvash, jharkhand ke mukhyamantri ke taur par yah unki teesri pari he, vidambnaa yah he ki unhen ek bhi baar puure kaarykaal ke liye mukhyamantri rahane kaa shrey nahin mil sakaa he
 The next elections are to be held in 2014, but the growing influence of Jharkhand Vikas Morcha chief Babu Lal Marandi and his rivalry with the BJP candidate is bound to cause concern
 jahaan tak sorain kii baat he to munda ko samarthan dena unki majaburi he kyonki unke paas aisa aankada nahin he ki ve takhta palat kar saken
 They cannot even go to the Congress because Marandi, their arch-rival, is present there
 lekin ranneetik asafalataa ke baavjood sorain jharkhand main satta ke samaantar centre ke rup main ubhare hai jo niyamit rup se shashan main adhik bhagidaari kii maang karte rahete hai
 Today Munda has left his mentor far behind in terms of strategy
 munda pehali baar 1995 main sorain kii party se vidhayak bane the lekin 1999 main ve jhamumo chhodkar bhaajapa main shaamil ho gaye the
 The relationship between Munda and Soren has been fluctuating ever since the separation of roads
 ateet main, sorain or munda donon hi ek duusare ko mukhyamantri pad se utaarne main do-do baar sakriy rah chuke hai
 But today Munda seems to have been able to convince Soren that he has the same options
 sahmati patron ke lihaaj se sabase anukool arjuna munda ne-jinhone 2003-05 main jharkhand ke mukhyamantri ke taur par apane pehle kaarykaal main ispaat or urja kshetra main bade vyavsaayik gharaanon ke saath 50 se zyada saude kiye the-ne apni praathamiktaaon ko nae sire se taiyaar kiya he jise sochaa-samaj kadam mana ja rahaa he
 Munda now speaks of tribal interests rather than industrial development
 chunaav kii sthiti main ve jaanate hai ki yah unka sakht rukh he jo vot dilaaegaa
 In the era when West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh have faced land acquisition and have given permission to private investors to buy land directly from the landowners, the role of the state government remains only that of the minimum price fixer - The Chief Minister of Jharkhand has tightened the stance and prohibited the purchase of land directly by potential investors
 ve kehete hai, 'huesa anusuchit kshetron main adivaasiyon kii saanskrithik pahchaan kii suraksha ke liye kiya gaya he
 "it can be said that it is due to their electoral arithmetic or improved thinking about war preparation that they talk more about the overall development rather than the export of minerals
" ve kehete hai, ''ab jharkhand main udyog ke liye jameen kharidne se pehle rajya sarkaar ko sahamat karnaa jaruri he
 "every morning as the clock strikes 6, Munda starts the day with running for 35 minutes on the treadmill and he says," At the fifth level
 '' sambhawatah yah mukhyamantri ko jang ke liye achche se taiyaar kar sakegaa
