 Evidence of bribery in politics
 sabakuch khufia camere main kaid
 It was only after this revelation that Laxman's political career was eclipsed and Tarun Tejpal was surrounded by serious allegations of rape
 pichley 12 saalon main siyasat kii gumnaam galiyon main kho chuke vahi bangaroo lakshmana aaj muskaraate hai kyonki tejpal ke chehre kaa haav bhav kuch vaisaa hi he jaisaa kabhi bijepi ke is purv adhyaksh kaa tha
 Bangaru Lakshmana says, 'this man fell into the same pit he dug for others
 ' ve in dinon tejpal ke har kadam par najar banaae hue hai or poochhate hai ki khud ko ek saahasik patrkaar bataane vaala ye shaks aaj kanoon se kaayron kii tarah kyon bhaag rahaa he?tejpal ke bare lakshmana kehete hai, 'ye shaks naitik mulyon kii duhai dekar khud ko dusron se upar bataata tha lekin aaj dekhie wo kis kadar gir gaya he
 The air of ballooning morality has passed
 isane paise kamaane ke liye dusron ko blackmel kiya
 'tejpal is trapped in any charges today, but this sting operation of 2001 does not prove to be wrong, although BJP leaders say that i have been proved right today
 bangaroo lakshmana ne kaha, 'aaj tejpal kii sachai sabake saamne aa gai
 After getting stuck, he takes up the matter of 2001 and claims that BJP is taking revenge from him for the sting operation done against Bangaru Laxman
 main usase poochna chahta hum ki kya bijepi ne use goa main thindfest kaa aayojan or aisa ghinauna aparaadh karne ko kaha tha
 'he says,' Today Tejpal got busted
 'aapako bataa den ki pichley 12 saalon main jab kisi bhi news dibet main raajnneetik bhrashtachar kaa mudda uthaa tab bangaroo lakshmana kaa naam liya jaataa rahaa he
 Even though Bangaru Laxman continues to deny the charges against him even after being convicted, the truth is that he has been convicted by the lower court

 This is not only the story of Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, the mathematics of Karnataka elections is also being decided on the basis of caste
 karnataka main lingayat sabase majboot jati he,jisaki sankhya17fisadi he
 Vokkaliga constitute 15% of the population, while 23% are Dalits and Adivasis, while 9% are also Muslims
 yahi vajah he ki sabhi dalon ne tikat bhi isi aadhaar par baante hai
 Out of 224 seats in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, BJP has given 68 seats to people of Lingayat community, while Congress has given 49 seats and JDS has given 41 seats to this community
 jabaki duusari badi jati vokkaliga parashakeshki pakad he,kyonki devegoda isi jati se aate hai
 JDS has given tickets to 55 people of Vokkaliga community, Congress has given 46 seats and BJP has given 38 seats to this community
 karnataka aisa rajya he,jahaan mathon kii pakad janata par kaaphi majboot he
 This is the reason that the leaders of all the parties are seen traveling around the monasteries
 sabase bada or prasiddh math he siddhaganga math,jo tumkur main he
 The owner of this place is Shivakumara ji, who is 111 years old
 shraddhalu inhen bhagwaan kaa darja dete hai
 BJP President Amit Shah and Congress President Rahul Gandhi have both paid obeisance here
 chunki yah lingayat kaa pramukh math he,isliembhzf,khaskar yediurppa ko yahaan se samarthan kii khaasi ummid he
 There is another monastery - Murugha Math in Chitradurga
 jab yahaan pichhali baar amit shah gaye the,to math kii taraf se unhen ek gyaapan diya gaya tha,jisamen lingayat ko alpsankhyakon kaa darja dene kii maang kii gai thi
 Another Lingayat Math is the Srigere Math, which will, of course, go in favor of the BJP
 vahiin mandya main adichunchanagiri math he,jiske pramukh hai swami nirmalanandnath,jofun
 Tech
 hai aurathiithmadras se padhe hai
 Here Amit Shah, Rahul Gandhi and Yogi Adityanath have taken the mantle
 yah vokkaliga math he
 Obviously, the JDS has an advantage here, but the Congress is also trying to make a dent here
 usee tarah udupi main krishna math he,jahaan pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah ja chuke hai
 BJP has high hopes from here
 usee tarah chitradurg main madara gurupeeth he
 This is the Dalit Peeth, where Amit Shah has left
 aisa nahin he ki lingayat congress ko vot nahin karte the
 In fact, Lingayats got angry with the Congress in 1989 when Chief Minister Viren Patil was ousted by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi for rioting
 uske baad ke chunaav menoubhjhphka vot pratishat4
 14 per cent to 16
 99fisadi ho gaya
 The seats also increased from four to 40, while the Congress got 26
 95fisadi vot mili or siten milin34
 Now let's talk about Siddaramaiah's caste, Qurba, which is seven per cent, but this caste has got 17 tickets
 is chunaav main30aisi siten hai,jahaan lingayat banaam lingayat kii sidhi takkar he
 In Karnataka, the BJP has given all its strength, but it is also true that in the last 35 years, the Congress in Karnataka has never got less votes than the BJP
 magar is baar adhiktar survey yaa to congress ko badhat de rahe hai yaa trishanku vidhansabha dikhaa rahe hai,yani takkar kaante kii ho sakati he
 It remains to be seen whether Karnataka opens the doors of the South for the BJP this time or the Congress returns and creates new history

 In order to compensate the losses incurred on sale of diesel to government oil companies, its prices will be increased by 40 to 50 paise per liter every month
 desh main petroleum eendhanomen sabase zyada khapat dijal kii hi hoti he
 Petroleum Minister m Veerappa Moilyne said, "oil marketing companies can increase the prices of diesel by 40-50 paise per month till further orders
 ’ gauratlab he ki sarkaar ne dijal kii keemton ko sarkari niyantran se mukt karne kaa nirnay 17 janvari ko hi le liya tha

 With this, the price increase for wholesale customers has increased by ten rupees per liter
 moili ne bataaya ki dijal kii keemton main prati maah maamuli badhotaree karne kaa nirnay aglaa aadesh jari hone tak lagu rahegaa
 He, however, did not say when the oil companies would raise diesel prices again
 dijal kaa daam badhaane se is kadam se sarkaar dwaara di jane vaali sabsidi kii kareeb 12,907 karod rupee salanaa kii bachat hogi
 But some wholesale customers have decided to buy diesel from petrol pumps like retail customers
 moili ne kaha, ki unhone suna he ki gujarat or tamilnadu jaise rajyon ne kaha he ki unke rajya sadak parivahan nigam ab dijal thok main kharidne ke bajaay apni bason ke liye tel sthaneey petrol panpon se kharidenge
 Currently, these corporations buy fuel directly from oil companies for their personal use
 moili ne kaha, ‘hamen is masale par phir se vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 We have also heard this
 ham is par gaur kar rahe hai
 Instead of instructing the buses to fill diesel with petrol pumps, the state governments should reduce VAT and sales tax on diesel to make it cheaper

 UPSC NDA, NA 1 Final Result: View full PDF file here nirvachan ayog kii manshaa he ki ab do jagah se chunaav jeetne vaale netaa khaali kii gai seat ke upachunaav kaa sara kharchaa bharen
 The Commission wants the government to amend the law regarding electoral reforms
 chunaav sudhaar se sambandhit aise hi kuch suzav ayog ne centre sarkaar ko bheje hai
 In a letter sent to the Union Law and Justice Minister, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora has also requested to make provisions for giving the report of paid news and funding of donations to parties
 maujuuda niyamon ke mutabik, raajnneetik partiyon par 20 hajaar yaa isse zyada kaa chanda milane ke baad hi uskaa hisaab dene kii pabandi he
 The parties do not disclose the source of donations of less than 20 thousand and there is no restriction on them
 vidhi or nyaay mantralay ko haal hi main mili nirvachan ayog kii chitthee ke mutabik, agar sarkaar ko lagata he ki kisi ummidavaar ko do jagah se chunaav ladane se rokna uchit nahin he, to ye praavdhaan to kiya hi ja saktaa he ki agar wo donon jagah se jeet hasil kar ek seat khaali kare to aisi sthiti main khaali kii gai seat par hone vaale upachunaav kaa sara kharch use bharna hoga, jisane ek seat par jeet kar duusari seat khaali kii he
 Apart from this provision, the Commission also wants the government to give the commission the authority to recognize and cancel the registration and suspension of the political party for serious and repeated violations of the code of conduct and discipline
 abhi ayog ke paas raajnneetik dalon ke registration kaa adhikaar to he lekin registration radd karne kaa nahin he
 In such a situation, once registered, the fear of the Commission in the political parties disappears
 ayog ke saath kendriya vidhi sachiv kii isi saal janvari main baithak hui thi
 In the letter quoting the meeting, it has also been said that along with the Commission for Election Reform, the Law Commission has also made recommendations and suggestions over the years
 sarkaar ab vidhik praavdhaan ke liye inhen sansad se manjuuri dilaae
 The Commission has also told the government that in order to provide equal opportunities to all candidates in elections, it is necessary to rein in paid news
 aise main sarkaar ayog ko ye adhikaar de ki ped news se sambandhit logon or santhaan ke saath hi lenden kii rakam kaa bhi saarvajanik khulaasa kiya ja sake
 For this, it is necessary to include paid news in the status of corrupt conduct
 ayog ne nae yuva matadaataaon kii himaayat main bhi kuch suzav sarkaar ko die hai
 The Commission has written that now new voters should get four chances in the year instead of one to register their names in the ballot list
 yani ab 1 janvari, 1 april, 1 july or 1 oktober ke bich bhi nae matadaataaon ke naam list main joda jaae
 According to the present rule, only the name of the person who has completed 18 years of age by January 1 is included in the voter's list for that year
 koi 2 janvari ko 18 saal kaa ho to use agle saal tak intjaar karnaa hoga, lekin agar chaar maukey honge to aise matadaata saal bhar main hone vaale chunaav main bhi matdaan kar sakenge
 That is, the Commission has requested the government to take forward all those recommendations and move towards electoral reforms

 com / 5xpnzpv50m garibon ko makaan muhaiyaa karaane ke liye pradhanmantri narendra modi ne apana dream project laanch kiya tha, jise ham 'pradhanmantri awaas yojana' ke taur par jaanate hai
 But like all government schemes, this scheme too has a termite of corruption
 darasal, upi ke gonda jile main hi abtak 2032 log chinhit kiye gaye hai, jinhen apaatr (ayogy) hone ke baavjood is yojana se paisa mil gaya he
 When the administration came to know about this, 1432 out of 2032 ineligible people returned the money due to strictness
 is bhrashtachar ke khel main ab tak kul 56 logon ke khilaaf mukadmaa bhi darj kiya gaya he, jisamen pradhan, karmchaaree or apaatr shaamil hai
 According to Gonda CDO Ashok Kumar, the investigation has just started
 isamen or apaatr log milte hai to unke khilaaf bheekarrawai kii jaaegi
 At present, one and a half rupees 6 crores of the first installment received from 1432 ineligible have been deposited in the government treasury
 vahiin, yojana se paise paae mashooq ali ne bataaya, unke paas pehle se pakkaa makaan tha, lekin unhen is yojana kaa laabh mil gaya
 When the investigation started, he returned the money
 kuch aisa hi haal ilaake ke kai logon kaa he, jinhone exiaar ke dar se paisa waapas kar diya he
 There are also many people in this village who are actually eligible for this scheme, but they have not got the benefit of it
 inhen main se ek hai pandeypur gaanv main rahane vaali 82 saal kii kamala devi
 It is difficult for him to walk at this stage of age
 unhen dikhaai bhi kam hi detaa he
 It is alleged that when she went to meet the Pradhan for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, she said, if you want government money, first give money from your pocket
 kamala devi kii tarah hi gonda jile ke jhanjhari block ke panditpur gaanv main rahane vaali bhupadevi or mayadevi kaa haal bhi yahi he
 Both of them are living in a hut built in the field
 inke mutabik, inke paas rishwat dene ke paise nahin the
 Due to this, they could not get the benefit of Prime Minister Housing Scheme
 upi ke gonda jile main 16 block hai or inamen kareeb ek hajaar chote-bade gaanv hai
 In this case, it is just a hallmark
 philhal jaanch chal rahi hai, jisase ummid he ki kai aise apaatr saamne aaenge
 Also, strict action will be taken against them

 The comments gauratlab he ki asaram baapu ne somvaar ko die bayaan main kathith rup se kaha tha ki gat 16 disambar ko dilli main chalati bas main samuhik balaatkaar kii shikaar ladki bhi apane saath hui vaardaat ke liye baraabar kii doshi thi

 This important session was attended by BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi, Himanta Biswa Sharma, who was in charge of the Ministry of Finance, Education, Health and Tourism in the Assam government, former Union Minister and Congress leader Ajay Maken and Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra
 is satr kaa sanchaalan india today ke managing editor rahul kanwal ne kiya
 Congress formed Fair and Lovely Speaking on the issue of politicization of CBI, Ajay Maken said that Congress won the election and the BJP formed the government with the help of defections
 maakan ne kaha ki modi sarkaar ne sibiai kaa sahaara lekar rajyon main apni sarkaar sthapit karne kaa kaam kiya he
 During the session, Himanta Biswa said that the Congress had developed Fair and Lovely Cream in politics, while the BJP is merely using it
 ise bhi padhein: india today conklev east 2017: kolkata pahunchaa vichaaron kaa sabase bada manchapaschim bengal ne bijepi ko nakaar diyaavahin is mudde par minakshi lekhi ne kaha ki kisi ko bhrasht ghoshit karne kaa kaam court ko karnaa chahie na ki uskaa media trial hona chahie
 TMC leader Moina Mitra said the BJP had hurt democracy in the North East
 moina ne kaha ki bijepi ko saaf pataa he ki bengal main vah loktantric tareekon se chunaav nahin jeet sakati lihaaja vah dange or tanaav kaa sahaara lekar satta main aane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Businessman troubled by the illegal collection, Meenakshi Lekhi said that the law and order is a matter under the state government and in the current state of West Bengal, the Mamata government has completely failed
 iske saath hi mamata dwaara bijepi par bengal main sambhavit nivesh ko baadhit karne ke aarope par minakshi ne kaha ki puure desh jaanata he ki kis tarah se rajya main kaarobaariyon se avaidh vasuuli kii jaati he
 According to Meenakshi, businessmen avoid investing in West Bengal, upset by this illegal collection
 'tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma (taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah)' ke sabase chahete kairactor popatlal kii jindagi kaa sabase bada dard unki shaadi he
 Popatlal can often be seen getting upset for his marriage and Gokuldham residents have tried many times for his marriage
 lekin jethalaal se lekar dayaban or bhide master ko abhi tak kamyaabi nahin mil saki he
 But in the upcoming episode of 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah' with Popatlal, there is going to be a great accident and Gokuldham residents are going to have their hands full in this episode
 'tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma (taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah)' ke aane vaale episod main najar aayega ki vadodra main popatlal ne patang par apana pataa or phone number likhaa tha
 At the same time, he also wrote that if the girl who will get this kite and she is not married yet, Popatlal is ready to marry that girl
 bas isi se gokuldham ke sadasyon ko shaitani suujhi or unhone popatlal kii shaadi ke liye nakli dulhan kaa intjaam kar daalaa
 In 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah', it will be seen that Sapna comes to meet Popati with her aunt Gauri
 sabhi bahut khush hone kaa naatak karte hai or popat taiyaar bhi ho jaataa he
 But in the end, Sapna is replaced by her aunt Gauri as a bride
 bechaara popat is nautanki kii asaliyat jane bina pareshaan ghabaraaya hua sabase madad maangane jaataa he
 Will he get angry with all the members of the Popatlal Society when he finally finds out the truth? Not getting married is Popatlal's biggest problem and his friends have made such a big joke of this problem
 kya hoga 'tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma (taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah)'main? The Rajasthan High Court sought a response from the state government on a petition filed by Patidar leader Hardik Patel regarding 'unwanted surveillance' of Udaipur police outside his house

 He said that the Udaipur police has kept him hostage, while the Gujarat High Court order has not said that he will be kept under house arrest
 (hedline ke alaava, is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he, yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he

 a sensational incident of peak cutting has also been reported in Punjab
 yahaan jalandhar main ek mahila ne bataaya ki dopaher jab vah apane ghar main so rahi thi tabhi kisi ne uski chotii kaat di
 His son Sahil saw that his braid was cut
 iske baad usne turant apni maa ko jagaaya
 But he did not know anything
 police maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he
 According to information received from the Jalandhar Commissionerate Police, a woman named Rajarani, who lives in Tagore Nagar area of jalandhar city, has complained to the police that she was sleeping in her house in the afternoon
 isi dauraan kisi ne uski chotii kaat di or mahila ko pataa tak nahin chalaa
 During this, his son Sahil saw that his braid was cut
 iske baad sahil ne padosiyon ko bulaayaa or is sambandh main police ko suchit kiya
 In this regard, the Commissionerate Police says that the matter is being investigated and only then something can be said as to how someone in a closed room can cut someone's peak
 police ne ashanka jataai he ki yah kisi shaks kii sharaarat bhi ho sakati he
 Jokes were made about a week ago when the first peak in Rajasthan was cut
 phir chotii kaatane vaala kai jilon kii yatra kar aayaa tab logon kii ankhen chamakin
 The next day, when the top cutter started crossing the borders of the province, the incident became news and now the news of cutting the peak for the last two-three days remains a puzzling puzzle
 rudki ke paas ganganhar kotwali ilaake main dilashaana apane pati ke saath ghar baithe chotii kaatane kii khabar dekh rahi thi
 Interestingly, Ghalib's say
 
 
 kahin aisa na ho yun hi vahi kafir sanam nikle
 
 
 Dilshana's peak was cut in style
 tivi dekhte hue wo uth kar duusare kamare main gai thi ki chotii chali gai
 Dilshana shouted loudly
 sabhi kamare se daud kar uske paas aae, lekin dilashaala kii chotii to ja chuki thi
 She lay unconscious in the room
 uttarakhand main pehali chotii kati to police bhi aa pahunchi
 But the hands and feet of the police are swollen as to how to keep the top cutter invisible like Mr
 India
 baat sirf rudki tak kii nahin he
 Udham Singh is also uprooted
 udham singh nagar ke rudrapur transit camp main mahila ghar ke daravaaje par baithi hui thi ki achaanak uski chotii cat kar saamne gir gai
 When the peak was cut, the woman fell backward
 log baag jutane lage mahila kaa aspataal le janaa padaa
 But after this incident the Tantra mantra of the people started
 sabhi apane apane gharon ko totakon se abhimantrit karne lage
 Now look down from the mountain and see
 hardoi jile ke shahari ilaake main band kamare main pati or bacchon ke saath so rahi mahila kii chotii cat gai
 Oddly enough, the peak is being cut even in the closed room
 chotii cat jane ke baad mahila ne shor machaaya to beti daud kar ai
 He saw that the mother's top was cut off, and the whole locality was gathered
 police vaale pahunch gaye
 Seeing the condition of the woman, all were upset
 hardoi main chotii kaat kar le jane kii ghatana se koharaam machaa hua he
 From Hardoi, come to Fatehpur
 fatehpur ke hanumangadhi gaanv main mahila apane bacchon ko khaanaa khilaa rahi thi ki achaanak behosh ho gai
 Seeing the woman unconscious, the family members picked her up
 mahila ko uthaaya gaya to uski chotii kati hui mili
 Surprisingly, the peak cutting incident is happening in the villages, towns or towns of the city
 dilli main bhi ye ghatana hui lekin yahaan bhi ilaaka kuch isi tarah kaa tha
 Big cities of big cities are left with the terror of cutting the peak
 baalo ke aise kate guchchhe ab aam hote ja rahe hai
 The cities are growing with which the fear is increasing
 shahar badal jate hai
 Territories change
 lekin nahin khatm ho rahaa to chotii kaatane kaa silsilaa
 After UP, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi, now the peak harvesting of women has started in Punjab
 punjab main bhi chotii kaatane kaa maamla ab sirf ek shahar tak simit nahin hai
 Like Ludhiana, the peak cutting incident has also occurred in Hoshiarpur
 chotii kaatane valene police kii mushkilen bhi badha rakhi hai
 Rumors are hot in the market
 aakhir koun he jo bal kaat rahaa hai
 This peak is considered to be an important decoration for women
 koi uskaa hi dushman ban baitha he
 Is it a conspiracy or mischief? vaaradaaten badhati ja rahi hai
 With this, the matter is becoming serious
 dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki khulaasa kab hota he

 bhartiya cricket control board (bisisiai) ne nio sports or nio cricket tivi channelon main nimbus communications public limited kii 89 fisadi hissedari kurk kar lee he
 The share price was Rs 890 crore
 aanki gai he
 This has been done in lieu of the liabilities of its promoter Harish Thawani
 yah karrwai 27 janvari ko bombai hycourt kaa faisla aane par kii gai he
 The court's decision came after the BCCI alleged that 51-year-old Thawani owed Rs 2,000 crore from the apex body of Indian cricket
 thagne ke liye ek bade ghapale kaa taana-bana buna
 The BCCI claims that a consortium (consortium) of three public sector banks - Union Bank of India (lead banker), Indian Bank and Punjab National Bank - also colluded with Thawani
 board ke anusaar, disambar 2011 main jab usne nimbus kaa broadcast qaraar radd kar diya, to in bainkon ne niyamon ko todate hue 1,600 karod ru
 Refused to cash in on the guarantee
 board ne yah daawa bhi kiya ki nimbus ne uske saath hue broadcast contract ko guarantee ke liye rehan ke taur par istemaal kiya tha
 At the root of the alleged scandal is a clause added by Thawani and former IPL Commissioner Lalit Modi in the Bank Guarantee Agreement
 is dhara main kaha gaya he ki agar bisisiai nimbus kaa broadcast qaraar radd karti he, to us haalat main bank guarantee ke evaj main nakadi nahin denge
 This provision was against all the rules of banking
 pataa chalaa he ki guarantee ko manjuuri bainkon ke bordon ne di thi

 Raghu Raman says, 'this is a scam
 bhugtan na karne kaa praavdhaan thawani or bainkon ko guarantee bhunaane se bachaane ke liye daalaa gaya, kyonki evaj main kuch tha hi nahin
 The board claims that while negotiating the guarantee with banks in 2009, Thawani colluded with Modi, who was then the top BCCI official, to include the controversial provision
 2009 main thawani ke saath bisisiai ke channel kaa prastaav rakhane vaale modi ne nimbus ke saath bank qaraar tay karne main apni bhagidaari kii pushti kii he
 Former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, who is facing 42 cases of financial mess, wrote on his website in December, "this provision i added that the bank guarantee will be voided if the contract is terminated
 ’bisisiai ke adhikari daawa karte hai ki modi ne yah praavdhaan thawani kii madad karne ke liye joda tha
 Thawani faced a huge cash problem and could not buy the rights without the help of someone inside
 board ke adhikari kehete hai ki yah ek tarah kii santhganth kaa ghapala tha
 Ratnakar Shetty, head of operations of the board, says that Thawani and Modi violated BCCI guidelines and made the contract a mortgage for banks
 ve kehete hai, ‘yah gambhir aparaadh he
 The BCCI rules do not allow anyone to hire a contract
 ’is ghotaale ke liye sirf thawani or modi ko hi jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja rahaa he
 All the three public sector banks are also equal criminals
 bhartiya rigerv bank ke disha-nirdeshon main saaf taur par kaha gaya he ki guarantee ke liye jitani bhi rakam kii manjuuri di jaae, bainkon ko us puri rakam kii guarantee kii maang kerani chahie
 Alpana Killawala, an authorized spokesperson of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) confirms that the bank is investigating the matter, but she says the RBI policy is not to comment on any specific matter
 arabiai ke ek varisht adhikari kehete hai ki in bainkon ko farvari ke madhya tak jawaab dena he ki jab company kii ore se di gai guarantee main sirf is baat kaa akalan tha ki unhen gharelu maichon or videshi licencing se kitni aamadani kii ummid he, to phir unhone nimbus ko guarantee kii manjuuri kyon di
 The official's question is, 'the income from the match cannot be estimated and if the company does not have the cricket to show, what will you take from the channel?' PNB chairman Kamath says that he would not comment will not do
 indian bank ke bhasin or union bank of india ke nair ne india today ke dedh maheene se kiye ja rahe i-mail or telephone colls kaa koi jawaab nahin diya
 The BCCI is hopeful that it will recover its dues after the High Court order
 bisisiai ko nimbus ke share kurk karne kii anumati dene ke alaava adaalat ne nimbus ko yah bhi aadesh diya he ki vah 305 karod ru
 Submitted to the court
 yah vah kamai he, jo bharat-england or bharat-west indies series se hui thi or inkaa prasaaran bisisiai kii is shikaayat ke baad hua tha ki thawani ne in do series ke dauraan itani rakam ke vigyaapan bech die hai
 Despite attachment of Nimbus' stake in Neo Sports and Neo Cricket, the BCCI received around Rs 700 crore

 The court's order imposed a premium on the company's current price of a potential Rs 2,500 crore

 As per the order, Nimbus, a Mumbai-based company with 58 per cent stake in Neo Sports and Neo Cricket, will now have to report it to the BCCI if they find a buyer

 Prior to this, Nimbus had also appointed two investment banks - Barclays Capital and Avendus - to help in its sales

 chini smartphone company shaomi ne apane apane android van plateform range main ek nae smartphone Mi A2 ko haal hi main joda tha
 This smartphone is also special because its earlier model Mi A1 made a lot of headlines
 hamane is smartphone ko lambey samay tak upyog kiya he or ab ham iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 Let us tell you that the company has kept its initial price of Rs 16,999
 bild quality and dizin:dizin ke maamle main baat karen to ye smartphone kuch had tak Redmi Note 5 Pro kii tarah dikhaai detaa he
 Its back panel is of aluminum, while the front has glass
 front main 5
 There is a 99-inch LTPS IPS LCD screen
 yahaan aapako screen main top aup bottm main begels dikhaai denge
 The special thing is that Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection has been given in its screen, which is a good thing
 iske alaava aapako bataa den iske bottm panel main spikar ko jagah di gai he or bich main charging ke liye tip-c port kaa saport diya gaya he
 However, it does not have standard headphone jacka support and the slot for inserting a memory card is also not present in this smartphone
 iske back panel main graahakon ko dealcameramiltaa he or back main hifingerprint scanrabhi maujuud he
 However, it causes a slight slippery while holding the phone
 aise main phone ke girane kaa dar rahata he, haalanki phone ko yuj karte-karte aapako ise chalaane kii aadat ho jaayegi
 Performance and Battery: The Mi A2 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor and has 64GB of internal memory with 4GB of RAM
 is price range main SD660 kaa diya janaa ise khaas banaata he or 4GB ram ise kaaphi saport bhi karata he
 Also, let us tell you that this smartphone runs on stock Android
 stock android hone kii vajah se isamen kisi tarah kaa custom skin aapako dekhne ko nahin milegaa
 Also you do not get any kind of preloaded apps in it
 isamen aapako nots se lekar, FM or recorder bhi nahin milegaa
 For these, you have to download the app separately
 haalanki aapako FM internet se hi chalaane kii majaburi rahegi
 Talking about performance, it performs just like the Mi A1
 ise yuj karte vakt aapako koi lag feel nahin hoga
 Whether you do multi-tasking or switch many apps, this smartphone does not cause any problem
 yani 4GB ram kaa saport yahaan behatar tareeke se miltaa he
 Even if you play heavy games in it, the performance of this smartphone is good
 haalanki kuch ghanton main hi ye smartphone garam ho jaataa he
 One problem is that the 64GB storage present in this smartphone cannot be increased with the help of additional memory cards
 aise main kuch log ise bahut badi samasya maan sakate hai
 However, due to being stock Android, it gets unlimited storage in Google Cloud
 jahaan tak fingerprint scinar kii baat he to ye bhi kaaphi fast he
 Now, to talk about its battery, this smartphone has disappointed us here
 hamaari bydaree loop test main is smartphone ne kareeb 8 ghante tak hamaara saath diya he
 Which is quite low according to this price range
 aaj ke daur main jahaan bydaree kii paryaapt jarurat kii vajah se power bank ki bikri bad gai he
 In such a situation, giving such a low battery can be such a thing, due to which people do not buy despite all the features
 saath hi aap agar isamen lagaataar HD video bhi dekh len to tab bhi 8 ghante se zyada saath nahin degaa
 That is, in a way, the situation becomes such that you will feel the need to keep the charger with you at all times
 regular upyog main ye smartphone 7 ghante baad hi power sever mod main jane ke liye kahata he
 Also, let us tell you that it will take 2 hours to fully charge this smartphone with the given charger
 camera:camera hi ek aisi cheez he is smartphone main jisane hamen sabase zyada prabhavit kiya he
 Talking about the specifications, a dual camera setup has been given in its rear
 iskaa primary camera 12megapixl(sony IMX 486 sensor) kaa he vahiin secondary camera 20 megapixl (sony IMX 376 sensor) kaa he
 Aperture f / 1 for both sensors
 75 kaa he
 Now the special feature of this smartphone's camera is that the secondary camera is usually a depth sensing lens, or telephoto lens or wide-angle lens for the bokeh effect
 jabaki is smartphone main camere liting condishan ke hisaab se kaam karte hai
 In day lighting, the 12 megapixel lens takes photo photos while the 20 megapixel lens takes care of things like depth casing and HDR
 yahaan lo-lite condishan main camera 20 megapixl lens main switch ho jaataa he or 12 megapixl lens isaki madad karata he
 AI is used here for portrait mode
 yahaan back main LED flash bhi maujuud he
 Users can also take the help of manual mode for manual operation
 haalanki ye camera auto mod main bhi behtareen kaam karata he
 The performance of this smartphone in low-light photography is amazing
 kyonki aamtaur par smartphone camere din main acha pradarshan karte hai lekin lo-lite main unki parformens ladkadaa jaati he
 It also retains background blur in low-light
 iskaa focus bhi fast he or juum main diteling kam nahin hoti he
 There is a 20 megapixel camera for selfie here which gives bokeh effect and photos are also very natural
 hamaare rivyuu ke hisaab se ham ise is price segment main best camera smartphone kah sakate hai
 Secondly, in case of video recording, 4K recording can be done with the primary camera here
 sample photose:faisla:to kulamilaakar ab sawaal ye he ki kya ise kharida janaa chahie
 So the answer is that if you want a good processor, stock Android and best camera in the budget then you can invest money in it
 lekin jin kamiyon ko aapako dhyaan rakhana hoga wo ye ki isaki internal memory ko card ke jariye badhaayaa nahin ja saktaa, standard headphone jaik bhi nahin milegaa or bydaree kii parformens keemat ke hisaab se behad niraashajanak he
 In such a situation, you can take a decision according to your need

 The stress and pressure a top-level player faces is negligible compared to a life-saving cardiac surgeon, or a soldier trying to keep peace
 iskaa sirf ek apwaad he-bhartiya cricketer
 Where an English or Australian player gives this word a show of importance, the Indian player understands what the real meaning of pressure is

 On the eve of the World Cup semi-final against Australia in Ahmedabad, a section of the media — known for its uncontrollable sentiments — was repeatedly slamming captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni over the alleged breakdown of relations with the press
 haalanki unke liye koi mauka nahin tha
 No matter how high the flames, Dhoni has become adept at pacifying them with a clever answer or strong sentence

 The editors of newspapers and magazines did the same, finding sensational titles instead of actual news
 yah baat suvidhajanak dhang se bhulaai ja chuki he ki hallagulla khatm hone or nibat jane ke baad cricket sirf ek khel hi he
 There are two basic elements of the game - the players who play and the fans who pay to watch it
 media sirf ek madhyam he, sandeshvahak
 As Dhoni pointed out, the Indian team has not missed a single mandatory press conference, they were just refusing to do more than the minimum

 Some scandals happen in India that properly expose the inner game of power relations due to its nomenclature
 jaise tu-ji, thri-ji ke baad sonia ji rahul ji
 Equipped with the ability of this verses style, a scam of Madhya Pradesh is gaining fame, which you know as Vyapam scam

 From there it starts to open like a properly wrapped carpet and reaches the threshold of Shivraj Singh Chauhan's government

 To accomplish this, first many rules are changed like the category of reserved seats of Scheduled Castes, Tribes and obcs are changed to Reserve and others are written as merit

 The PIL filed in the Madhya Pradesh High Court has said that there has been a scam in 150 recruitment examinations

 abhi tak 20 aise scorer pakade gaye hai jo duusare rajyon se laae jate the or munna bhaaiyon ko paas karakar doctor bana rahe the
 More than 450 people have been arrested

 Admissions to more than 1000 medical students have been canceled
 dhyaan rahe ki yah abhi sirf 2012−13 kii medical pravesh pariksha main ujagar hua he
 Earlier three exams are also under doubt
 unki jaanch hogi to pataa nahin kya nikal jaae
 The scam has questioned the administrative control of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, whose public has been expressing tremendous faith in him in the name of efficiency

 Not even ten thousand reward

 Saraswati became a lecturer in the Engineering College from a teacher in Shishu Mandir and then OSD of former minister Laxmikant Sharma

 Despite all these controversies, the Madhya Pradesh government appointed Sudhir Sharma in the Center for Research and Industrial Staff Performance

 Such a study should also be done on the Sudhir Sharma found in many states including Madhya Pradesh

 bihar ke mukhya sachiv ne bataaya ki chhattisgarh ke bilaspur se pump mangaaye ja rahe hai
 These are the pumps which are extracted after filling water in coal mines
 is tarah ke pump se ek minute main 1000 se 4000 galen pani nikaala jaataa he
 If this crisis does not come then such a minor solution is not known
 yah deazal pump laane kii zarurat kyon padi? ise samajhane ke liye aapako patna main baadh yaa barish ke pani ko nikaalane kaa system samajhnaa hoga
 We spoke to some local journalists who have written on the condition of Sump House
 patna main 38 samp house hai
 Only 6 sump houses are working
 vaise prashasan daawa karata he ki saare samp chal rahe hai
 This is the Samp House in the hill at the eastern end of Patna, where Kankarbagh ends
 yaheen par kankarbagh or saidpur naala miltaa he
 Through this, the water of Kankarbagh is pulled out, but the Punpun river flows on the side which is above the danger mark
 isliye kankarbagh kaa pani nahin nikal sakaa
 Kankarbagh has four motors
 ek motor se ek second main ek hazaar litre pani dren out ho saktaa he
 It is obvious that this is why a motor of this capacity is being called from Bilaspur
 bahadurpur main 5 samp house hai lekin ek chal rahaa he
 The situation in Rajendra Nagar is appalling as Samp House in Dinkar Golambar, Rampur and Chandanpur is not running
 electric pump pani main dub gaya tha
 If the Sampra House of Srikrishnapuri is running, the water of the boring road could be drained
 uttari patna kaa pani nikaalane ke liye mandiri samp house he or rajapur samp house he
 Water is thrown from them into the Ganges, but there the Ganges is flowing above the danger mark
 yogipur samp house jo kankarbagh main he use chaalu kiya ja chukaa he
 They have a very low water-carrying capacity
 pehle pani nikaalane kii zimmedaari patna nagar nigam kii thi
 But later the government gave it to the Bihar Urban Development Corporation
 kaayade se iske pramukh ko media ko jaankaree deni chahie thi lekin mukhya sachiv press conference kar bataa rahe hai ki bilaspur se deazal pump aa rahaa he
 a statement from the Commissioner of Patna Municipal Corporation has been published from Hindustan Times that 38 sump houses are running
 phir bhi pani nahin nikal rahaa he
 Even after this, how long will the water come out? sthaneey media main in daavon se alag report chap rahi he ki samp house chal nahin rahe hai
 Social activist Rajeev from News Click has said that half the Samp houses are closed
 kaam nahin kar rahe hai
 From the Times of India, Minister of Urban Development Suresh has said that 38 Sump houses have been run
 mantri ne mana he ki oficial kii taraf se laaparvaahee hui
 They should have started Sump House as soon as the water accumulates
 yani samp house chalaane main deree hui khud mantri maan rahe hai
 The minister is claiming that if the Sump House will go, then why are new Samp Houses being called
 phir susheel modi kii is baithak kii tasviir ke saath jo press release jari kii gai he usamen kyon kaha gaya he ki 48 ghante main jalajmav main kami laaen
 This means the situation is still not right
 is press relies main up mukhyamantri ne kaha he ki kol india, antipisi or kalyanpur cement se ucch kshamta ke pump mangaaye ja rahe hai taaki rajendra nagar or kankarbagh se pani nikaala ja sake
 With 50 new pumps, water will be extracted at the war level
 jal sansaadhan vibhaag se bhi pump mangane kaa nirnay liya gaya
 Obviously, all this is being done so that 37-38 Sump houses are not working as they already are
 bihar ke shahari vikaas mantralayan ne patna ke vikaas par ek report banaai he
 It has a plan for Patna plans from 2010 to 2030
 isamen drenez par ek section he
 It has fixed 1 crore for Sump House between 2011 and 15 and one crore between 2016-20
 sochie 2011 se 2020 tak yani 9 saal ke liye samp house par sarkaar maatr do karod
 While a sump house costs 8 to 10 crores
 uske saath drenez system hota he, wo sab milakar laagat 40 karod bhi ho sakati he
 You tell me what will happen in two crores
 jaahir is vakt logon kii nazar he to baithkon or bayanon ke zarie sakriyata kaa ahsaas karaayaa ja rahaa he
 When we saw the report on the development plan of Patna City on the website of the Urban Development Ministry of Bihar, there is no money written for the improvement and repair of the main drain from 2016 to 2030
 is website se aapako yahi jaankaree milti he
 This report notes that there is a possibility of flood in the central part of Patna
 poorabi yani puraane shahar main drenez system dhang se nahin bana he
 The pebbled area has limited drainage and is inadequate
 ye khud sarkaar kii report kahati he
 Therefore, it is important that we look at the questions with these pictures of the flood to know what those who were responsible for Patna were doing
 haal ke bayanon or baithkon kii tasveeron kii gambhirtha par mat jaaiye
 The same situation is with the sewage treatment plant being constructed under the Namami Gange project
 ise puraa hone ko lekar alag-alag bayaan chal chape milenge
 In June, the statement printed that stps would be ready by the end of June and would be operational from October but Hindustan Times reported on October 1 that none of the five stps was ready
 sivej treetment plant kaa kaam hota he gande naale ko saaf karnaa taaki ganga maili na ho
 The government responded to the Parliament in February 2019 about the budget under Namami Gange
 2014-15 main 2053 karod manzur hue the lekin 170 karod hi jari hue
 1650 crores were approved in 2015-16 but only 602 crores were released
 2016-17 main 1675 karod manzur hui lekin 1062 karod jari hui
 So this is the situation
 puraa paisa bhi jari nahin hota he
 Under Namami Gange, between 2015 and 2019, an amount of 11,471 crore was approved but only 4024 crore was released
 7000 karod rupaya jari nahin hua
 When the money does not come, how will the work be speeded up? patna main 400 kilometre undergranund sivej network banane kii bhi yojana manzur he
 The status of these schemes is not known
 yojanaon kaa elaan to bad chadh kar kiya jaataa he, media main hedline chhapata he, dharna ban jaati he ki kaam ho rahaa he lekin uske baad sab apane raftaar se ho rahaa hota he
 The details of Patna's condition are boring and cumbersome but this detail shows that Patna has been allowed to become a burden
 isliye patna ko lekar agar aap chintit hai to javabdehi par baat honi chahie
 Manish Kumar spoke to an architect on the panel of Patna Municipal Corporation
 unhone patna nagar nigam ko lekar apana anubhav bataaya he
 Part of the 2017 Telegraph report is interesting
 patna hoicourt ne sarkaar ko aadesh diya ki 40 microne kii motaai vaale polithin bag par roak lagani chahie to patna nagar nigam ke vakil adaalat se kehete hai ki suraksha kii kami ke kaaran aadesh kaa ulanghan karne waalon ke khilaaf karrwai nahin kar paa rahe hai
 In places where 40 micron plastic ban has been launched, people have revolted and law and order problem has arisen
 patna ko behatar bananaa chaahate hai to patna par dhyaan dijie
 Who is running the city and how is running the city
 baari barish se desh ke anya hisson main bhi tabaahi he
 There is also a considerable impact in eastern Uttar Pradesh

 The rains in Rajasthan have affected the millet and sesame crops
 ek kisaan ne barish ke samay hi reporter kii tarah ricard kar liya
 In the case of SC / ST Act, the Supreme Court has reversed the decision of 20 March 2018
 tab court ne aadesh diya tha ki is act ke tahat giraftaar hone se pehle jaanch hogi
 Protests were held across the country and the government was pressured to enact laws and implement the old system
 centre sarkaar ne agast 2018 main loksabhaa or rajyasabha se section 18e ke tahat exiaar se pehle jaanch ko gaiyr zaruri ghoshit kar diya tha
 a challenge has also been challenged against this refinement in the Supreme Court, which will be heard on October 3, but today's decision has come on the appeal of the Central Government
 ab pehle kii taraf eses / asti act main giraftaar se pehle jaanch kii zarurat nahin hogi
 First there will be arrest and then there will be investigation
 justise arun kumaar mishra, justise bi aar gawai, justise em aar shah kii bench ne faisla sunaate hue kaha ki 2018 kaa aadesh samvidhan kii bhaavana ke kilaaf tha
 In 2018, the court said that the SC / ST Act is being misused
 lekin ab court ne kaha he ki 70 saal ho gaye magar chhuachhut samaapt nahin hui he
 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are facing ignorance and abuse and have been socially ostracized for centuries
 ham yah maanane ke liye majaboor hai ki anusuchit jati or janajati ke log samanta or desh ke vibhinn kshetron main naagarik adhikaron kaa prayog karne ke liye sangharsh kar rahe hai
 They are still being discriminated against
 aarakshan ke baad bhi vikaas ke fal un tak nahin pahunche hai
 How such a situation has persisted, are we responsible, the answer can only be found by searching for conscience
 ham unhen moulik adhikaron or suvidhaayen pradaan nahin kar paaen hai
 Scheduled tribes are also kept separate in some places
 unhen buniyadi suvidhaayen nahin de paae hai

 Counting the benefits of demonetisation, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, from the platform of India Today conclave-next, said that the biggest benefit of demonetisation in one year has been that people are getting scared of cash dealing
 jetali ke bataaya ki pehle notebandi se paidaa hua yah dar or baad main jiesti lagu hone se bhartiya arthvyavastha ab apane tex collection or acesment ke kaam ko puri tarah se digital map par laa chukaa he
 Decision on demonetisation on completion of one year of demonetisation, Arun Jaitley said that according to whatever decision the central government has taken in the last 3 years, the decision of demonetisation was absolutely correct
 bharat agar viksit desh bananaa chahta he to cash se itar digital arthvyavastha par tej gati se kaam hona chahie
 Jaitley said that with the decisions of the Central Government, the process of reducing cash currency has started in the country
 jetali ne kaha ki yadi ham desh me karadaataaon kii sankhya ko badhanaa chaahate hai to aisa faisla lenaa behad jaruri tha
 The Finance Minister claimed that it is clear from the data collected after the Kinotbandi that the number of tax payers is increasing steadily
 vahiin jetali ne yah bhi kaha ki notebandi ne naksali gatividhiyon or antakawaad kii ghatnaon par bhi kaabo paane ke apane makasad ko puraa kiya he
 Demonetisation has been imposed on millions of shell companies, however, on the economic and behavioral turmoil created by demonetisation, the Finance Minister said that it is not fair to see the decision of demonetisation as just one decision
 is faisle ko kendra sarkaar dwaara blikemani par lagaam laganeke liye uthaae gaye anya kadamon ke saath milakar dekhne kii jarurat he
 Jaitley claimed that millions of shell companies have been put under control in the country after demonetisation

 Very soon, the money from these companies will be caught

 Investigations are on against these companies and this is the biggest benefit of demonetisation
