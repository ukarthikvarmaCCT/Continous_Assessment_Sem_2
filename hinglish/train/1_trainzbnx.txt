 Radhakrishnan spoke to him on this issue
 17 saal puraane balaatkaar kaa maamla ek baar phir se aapke peeche padataa dikh rahaa he
 Yes, i have been troubled by this matter for the last 17 years
 alag-alag sarkaron ke tahat teen police jaanch ke baad mujhe nirdosh paaya gaya
 Two state governments and the Supreme Court have also held me innocent
 iske baavjood main balaatkaari kaha ja rahaa hum
 But during this time the victim has been strongly reiterating her allegations? i have only 2 daughters
 meri potiyaan bhi hai
 i can only express my sympathy to the victim
 peedita dwaara mujh par aarope lagaaya janaa yaa to galat pahchaan kaa nateeja he yaa use aarope lagane ke liye koi uksaa rahaa he
 But is it not that she is the only girl who is constantly accusing you? It can happen
 har maukey par lagaae gaye aarope puri tarah se suniyojit maaloom hote hai
 The matter arises only when i stand for election
 kya aap is maamle main nai jaanch ke liye taiyaar hai?is maamle main alag-alag agenciyaan varshon pehle hi nirnay suna chuki hai
 In this case, how far is the investigation of this case right? According to the law related to rape, the things said by the victim should be given due consideration
 lekin is maamle main kanoon kaa majaak banaaya gaya
 Many courts and many investigating agencies have dismissed this case
 yah samvidhan or aparaadh se jude kanoonon ke khilaaf he
 My rights are being violated
 kya aap is cese kaa faisla hone tak rajyasabha ke up sabhapati ke pad se hat jaaenge? kya yah ajeebogareeb sthiti nahin hogi ki rajyasabha mahilaon ke khilaaf aparaadhon kii rokthaam ke liye bill laane kii taiyaari main he or ise koi aisa shaks pesh karegaa, jis par rape ke aarope hai?kya mujhe sirf is baat par istipha de dena chahie ki mujh par is tarah ke aarope lagaae gaye hai? aaj koun aaropon kaa saamana nahin kar rahaa he, chaahe vah pradhanmantri hi kyon na hon
 What do you have to say in response to the allegations? There are many contradictions in the earlier statements of witnesses defending you
 kya is maamle se aapkaa naam puri tarah hatane tak kisi nai jaanch kii jarurat nahin he?is maamle main jo gavaah rahe hai, unhone jaanch agenciyon ke saamne apana bayaan diya he
 The investigating agencies and the courts have found me not guilty
 aaj jabaki aap aaropon kaa saamana kar rahe hai, iske baavjood e

 kya congress or anya partiyon kaa sawaal uthaanaa jaij he? Has food inflation been contained? No
 aankade bhraamak hai
 According to the latest government data in May, inflation in food items is 7
 47 pratishat he, jo ki pichley 18 maheenon main sabase kam he
 The food inflation was 20 percent in the same period last year
 mahangaai dar bhale hi kam hui ho lekin jaruri khaadya padaarthon kii keemten ab bhi 7 pratishat kii dar se bad rahi hai
 Prices of fruits are increasing at the rate of 30 percent, making it difficult for the common man to taste the fruits
 sarkaar ke liye isse bhi zyada chintaa kii baat yah he ki mahangaai sirf khaadya vastuon tak hi simit nahin rah gai he
 Last week, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said, "though the prices of food items are decreasing, but 'core' inflation remains a matter of concern
 '''kor' mahangaai shabdaawalee kaa istemaal khaadya vastuon or eendhan se itar anya vastuon kii keemton main badhotaree ko sambodhit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, mukhya rup se nirmit vastuon ke liye
 WPI 8 in April 66 fisadi tha, jo ki khaadya vastuon kii mahangaai dar se kahin upar tha
 This was much higher than the normal rate of 4 percent
 yah lakshan acha nahin he
 In its statement on credit policy on 3 May, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor D
 subbarao ne kaha ki unhen ummid thi ki sitambar tak mahangaai oonchi bani rahegi
 He estimated that by March 2012 the rate of inflation would come down to 6 percent
 is purvanumaan main bhi unhone, urdhvagami rukh kii sambhaavna jod di
 Agreeing with Subbarao's prediction, Mahesh Vyas, CEO of the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy, says, "I think we are going to have a period of high growth and high inflation
" '' arthshaastri bibek debaroy kehete hai, ''mahangaai jane vaali nahin he
 All three components — food, construction, and ingredients — are growing
 ''vitt mantri kisi tarah kii bhavishyavaanee nahin karnaa chaahate hai
 Addressing the Indian Banks Association on May 21, he said, "there can be no forecast of inflation pressures and no definite direction can be given to them
" 2008 kii tarah, jab tel or kachche maal kii keemten ekadam badhane ke baad teji se neeche aa gai thim, aaj bhi kachche maal kii keemton par koi andaaj nahin lagaaya ja saktaa he
 No one can tell which stance they will take
 '' sarkaar ne lagaataar badhati mahangaai ke kai kaaran bataae hai
 These factors are the latest reason to hold global factors responsible
 mukherjee ne kaha, ''jab antarrashtriya bazaaron main anischitata ho, khaskar un vastuon par, jinhen hamen aayaat karnaa padataa he, to jaahir he ki mahangaai par asar padegaa
 "until a few months ago, the most preferred argument about inflation was that in order to have a high growth rate, we would have to pay the price of inflation
 janvari main khaadya vastuon kii mahangaai jab apane charam par thi to yojana ayog ke upaadhyaksh montek singh ahaluvalia ne kaha tha, ''haa, yah sahi he ki doodh or subjiyon kii keemten bahut zyada hai
 But it is a concept of economic prosperity and purchasing power
 '' maje kii baat he ki sarkaar ne mahangaai main vruddhi kaa shrey lene kii koshish kii he
 It argues that public spending schemes like NREGA have increased the income of people in villages, which has led to an increase in demand for food items
 keemton ko prabhavit karne main antarrashtriya karkon ko jimmedaar tehraane kii mukherjee kii baat main dam he
 In the last 12 months, prices of some key commodities across the world have skyrocketed, as both the developed and developing economies have gained momentum, leaving behind a period of economic crisis as economic conditions improve
 bharat par sabase gambhir asar kachche tel kii keemton main vruddhi se padaa he
 Its prices have increased by 40 per cent in the last 12 months
 mistra or libya main rajnatik sankat ke baad is samay kachche tel kii keemat prati bairel 100 dollar ke aasapaas mandara rahi he
 On May 15, the oil marketing companies raised the price of petrol to Rs 5 per liter due to an increase in crude oil prices internationally
 kii badhotaree kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Diesel is also soon priced at Rs 2
 prati litre badhane kii sambhaavna he
 With this increase, prices of other commodities will also increase
 debaroy kehete hai, ''kachche maal kii keemton main ijaaf se utpaadakon ke liye laagat bad jaaegi, jiske kaaran mahangaai or badhegi
 "an increase in the prices of raw materials internationally may be only part of the causes of inflation
 ye keemten to har desh ke liye ek hi rahengi
 In April, when the inflation rate in India was 8
 66 fisadi thi, tab teji se badhane vaali duusari arthvyavasthaaon main mahangaai kii dar apekshaakrit bahut kam thi
 This rate in China is only 5
 3 pratishat, brazil main 6
 5 percent and 4 in South Africa
 1 pratishat thi
 There are some legitimate problems in the domestic economy in terms of supply, but the government's strategy in controlling inflation seems to be focused only on the demand side
 arabiai ne pichley 12 maheenon main apni policy daren nau baar badhaai hai

 Sources say that the CBI team which reached Indonesia from Delhi and Mumbai has stepped up the process of bringing Chhota Rajan to India

 He said that when the score is 180 runs for two wickets then the bowlers do not give you much opportunity
 gendbaaj tab ballebaaj ko ran banane se rokane ke liye alag tarah kii ranneeti apanaate hai

 isse shami ko contract list se baahar karne ko lekar kayaas lagaae jane lage or bisisiai ke ek sheersh adhikari ne pitiai se kaha ki board ne unki patni haseen jahaan dwaara lagaae gaye aaropon ko dhyaan main rakhkar unka naam roak diya
 This comment was made by people involved in the controversy, Shami's class on Twitter said, "BCCI has taken cognizance of all the reports related to Mohammed Shami's personal life
 yah puri tarah se nijee maamla or bisisiai kaa isse koi lenaa dena nahin he
 But if the woman involved in this case met the Commissioner of Police in Kolkata, it would be prudent on behalf of the BCCI to wait for some kind of official investigation
 'unhone kaha, 'isliye philhal mohammad shami kaa naam aaj jari central contract list se hataa diya gaya
 We would like to reiterate that this decision has nothing to do with Shami's qualification as a player, but rather to defend it under the present circumstances
 'PHOTOS: patni se aise rahe shami ke rishte, ab lage avaidh sambandh ke aropamana ja rahaa he ki bisisiai ko chintaa he ki agar shami ke khilaaf lagaae gaye aarope sahi sabit hote hai to board kii chhavi kharaab ho sakati he
 Hasin Jahan has accused Shami of domestic violence and adultery in a social media post, but the fast bowler has described both of them as 'liars'

 australia ke captain steven smith ne bengalooru test main bhartiya captain viraat kohli dwaara nirnay samiksha pranali (diares) ke galat istemaal ke aaropon ko bakawaas bataaya he
 Smith says that Kohli made this thing complicated
 smith ne kaha ki unhen yah dekhakar hairat hoti he ki bharat ke saath us siries ke khatm hote hi is bare main har tarah kii baat band ho gai
 While talking to Cricinfo, Smith called Kohli's talk about DRS nonsense
 
 
 
 So that he can bring out the best in him, Smith said that Virat likes such an excited environment, so that he can get the best out of himself
 unhone kaha, 'viraat us tarah ke khilaadi hai, jo garam maahaul pasand karte hai, vah meri tarah hi ladaai ko pasand karte hai
 All i can say is that it was a way to stimulate the atmosphere in their series
 jisase vah apane andar se apana sarvshereshth nikaal saken
 What happened was during the Bengaluru Test on DRS, the Australian team which visited India earlier this year was ahead by winning the first Test in the series and chasing the target on a difficult pitch in the fourth innings of the second Test match played in Bengaluru
 
 isi dauraan smith ko ampire ne elbeadblyoo qaraar diya
 Smith went to Peter Handscomb standing at the other end to discuss DRS and was seen asking for help from the dressing room to take DRS
 haalanki ampire nijal long ne unhen aisa karne se roak diya
 'we never sought advice from the drenching room
 'baad main kohli ne iske liye australian team par khel bhaavana ko nuksaan pahunchane ke aarope lagaae the or kaha tha ki unhone is tarah kii harakatein australia dwaara pehle bhi dekhi hai
 This issue was in the news
 smith ne apni kitaab 'da jarney' main is baat kaa zikr kiya he
 Smith wrote in the book, 'after Kohli's post-match claims that we have done this twice before, i came to know where this thing has reached
 jahaan tak meri baat he, 'hamane kabhi drencing room se salaah nahin maangi
 'bcci's stump audio' Nihayat ordinary 'thakohli even said that he had already complained to the umpires about such an act
 main saaf taur par kah rahaa hum ki hamase na hi un maichon ke ampiron or match referi kris broad ne, kisi ne bhi is tarah ke niyamon ke ulanghan ke bare main kabhi baat nahin kii
 Smith said that it still remains a mystery to him that the matter was never discussed after the series
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki maamle main shabdon ke aadan-pradaan par bisisiai ne chhaantkar jo stump microphone audio diya vah 'nihaayat saadhaaran' tha
 '
 
 
 lekin yah sara mere liye ab bhi rahasy'australian captain ne kaha, 'isisi kii taraf se is mudde par aage kuch nahin hua or na hi viraat ne us mudde par kabhi kuch tafsil se bataaya
 After the match, Virat met as friends in a few meetings, captains meeting in IPL
 unka vyavhaar dosti vaala tha or lag rahaa tha ki unamem use lekar koi kadavaahat rahi hogi, to vah khatm ho chuki he
 It was a mystery to me and always will be

 yah faisla kohli ke lagaataar cricket khilne or dakshin africa daure se pehle unhen aaraam dene ke makasad se liya ja saktaa he
 However, the team has been announced for the two Test matches to be played against Sri Lanka in which Kohliko has been selected
 aise main sambhaavna jataai ja rahi he ki tisare test match or iske baad hone vaali limited overon kii siries main kohli ko aaraam diya ja saktaa he
 a BCCI official said, "kohli has played the most cricket in the whole world in the last one year
 unhen aaraam dene kii jarurat he
 However, the official has dismissed reports that Kohli had written a letter to the selectors to comfort him
 adhikari ne kaha, ki ‘kohli ne is tarah kii maang nahin rakhi he, lekin ab samay aa gaya he kiroteshan policyke tahat unhen aaraam diya jaae

 petrol or dijal kii keemten ek baar phir aasmaan par pahunch gai hai
 Petrol and diesel prices have continued to rise after the Karnataka elections
 somvaar ko petrol kii keemton ne 84 kaa aankada paar kiya
 Now on Tuesday, diesel has also reached a record high of Rs 74
 petrol or dijal kii badhati keemton ke bich inhen jiesti ke tahat laane kii baat bhi kahi ja rahi he
 However, it is not easy for the government to do so
 bad jaaengi keemten:agar petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laayaa jaataa he, to isse inaki keemton main kuch rajyon main kaaphi kami aa jaaegi
 But on the other hand, in some states where petrol is still sold for a lower price, people may have to pay more for this
 darasal maujuuda vyavastha main maharashtra jaise kai rajya jahaan 40 fisadi tak waite vasuulate hai, to vahiin andaman or nicobar jaise rajya 6 fisadi tak tex petrol or dijal par lagaate hai
 There will be a tax everywhere
 If petrol-diesel is brought under the purview of GST, then it will be the same tax instead of different sales tax across the country
 isse bhale hi maharashtra jaise kuch rajyon main thodi raahat milegi, lekin kam waite vasuulne vaale rajyon main petrol or dijal kii keemton main bahut bade str par badhotaree ho jaaegi
 In such a situation, no political party would want to take such a step
 rajyon main sahmati bananaa mushkildusri taraf, petrol or dijal se na sirf centre ko balki rajyon ko bhi rajasav ke taur par ek badi raashi milti he
 This huge amount comes from the VAT levied on them
 iske saath hi kam waite lagane vaale rajya kii sarkarein apane raajnneetik laabh ko dekhte hue petrol or dijal ko jiesti ke tahat laane par sahamat hongi, aisa hona mushkil lag rahaa he
 Because they will face the risk of rising prices due to GST
 kaise milegi raahat?agar petrol or dijal jiesti ke tahat shaamil nahin hota he, to sarkaar ke paas exise duty ghataane or rajyon ko waite kam karne ke liye kehane kaa vikalp hoga
 However, Tamil Nadu has already refused to take any such step

 The last time i was shocked in the name of death was when i read the news in the newspaper 'jagtanarayana's untimely death at the age of ninety', then became sad, maybe the next one must have been keeping a hundred, had to go ten years ago, untimely Was only haal hi main mujhe ek nae shabd ne chaunkaaya 'swaabhaavik mautein' maut dukh detii he, mautein chaunkaati hai, maut satya he, mautein tathy, mautein aankade
 Similarly, scams are unavoidable
 ghotaleextra karikular activitieshain, skool-college main padhai ke alaava ham jo kar liya karte the, yaa offis main baithe-baithe jaise ham do minute ko fasebuk khol lete hai
 Similarly, governments allow scams in between
 ghotaale parichaayak hai ki sarkaar ke paitaane har cheez sahi chal rahi he
 Scams may be something like a compatibility test
 sarkarein kai baar sirf ye jaanchane ko ghotaale hone detii hai ki dekhen sab durust to he
 Every part is connecting the right place and doing the right thing
 ghotaale aprihaary hai
 Investigation is also necessary after scams
 jaanch isliye nahi ki nattejey aaen
 Check to see if there are loopholes
 koi pakadaa to nahi ja rahaa
 Accuracy is necessary, even if it is not accurate in work, it is necessary to do wrong work
 jab tak haath na fanse jab tak galaa na nape, ghotaale-ghotaale nahi hote, routine kaa kaam hote hai
 In democracy, everything is not considered good unless there are scams
 durust tab mana jaataa he, jab ghotaale bhi hon, jaanch bhi ho or kisi kaa galaa bhi na nape
 'natural deaths' and 'humanitarian grounds' seem to me to be the two biggest jokes of the year
 swaabhaavik mautonka matlab galat nikaal liya gaya
 Many think that it means 'just died'
 unhen samajhnaa chahie iskaa matlab 'ise to maranaa hi tha' hota he
 Natural deaths are also happening on human grounds
 wo na jaaenge to kisi or ko janaa hoga
 Scams are inevitable, deaths are natural
 har kshetra main asantusht log bhare pade hai, kuch jaanchon se nahi adhaate
 Suppose there is an investigation from STF / SIT, then they will demand an investigation from CBI
 are kya sibiai waalon ke ghar-parivaar nahi hai? kyon khelte ho unki jaan se? aise main hamen kaan khadey rakhane chahie, aankh khuli rakhni chahie, lakshan pahchaanane chahie
 The day CBI investigates, understand that the last evidence has also been settled
 jab tak aakhri saboot yaa gavaah sabut he, sibiai jaanch ko haa nahi hogi
 CBI should be called somewhere like this, it would seem strange to give them a clean chit so soon

 main nishchit rup se phir se bihar kaa mukhyamantri ban saktaa hum, agar party mere is pad par bane rahane kaa faisla leti he
 But, yes, i will never lobby for the position
 maine raajnneeti main sirf ek baar lobbying kii thi, 1980 main vidhansabha tikat ke liye (dhire se hansate hai) aage phir kabhi nahin karuunga
 There is a perception in public that the bureaucracy does not listen to you
 mantri aapke nirdeshon kii shaayad hi parvaah karte hai
 Everyone thinks that you have been made the Chief Minister for some time
 mantri or afasar hamaari team ke sadsy hai or ham sab milakar kaam kar rahe hai
 Yesterday someone told me that the law and order of the state has come down drastically and today i have asked the top police and civil administration to fix it
 maine unhen bulaayaa or unase kaha ki mere liye aankadon kaa koi matlab nahin he
 People's perception matters and i cannot tolerate half-hearted measures
 main hameshaa janpratinidhi banane kii sochataa tha
 Once i became the people's representative, all the other posts fell behind
 ab mujhe or kisi pad kii ichha nahin he, lekin main aisa vyakti nahin hum, jo apni jimmedaariyon ko chhod de
 Your profile has not yet been uploaded on the CMO website, although it has been two and a half months since you became the Chief Minister
 vidhansabha kii website par aapkaa jo profile diya gaya he, usamen aapako ab bhi mantri bataaya ja rahaa he
 These exceptions may occur
 isse hamaara kaamkaaj prabhavit nahin hota
 But yes, the correct information must be uploaded
 aapako nitish kumaar ne apana uttaradhikari kyon chunaa? kya unhen sabase zyada bharosa aap par he, yaa isliye ki aap unhen party main sabase kam nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai? unhen aap par sabase zyada vishwaas yaa aapse sabase kam khatra tha?jab nitishji ne loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan mere liye prachaar kiya, to unhone ek sakasham prashaasak ke taur par meri kaaphi prashansa kii thi
 He spoke about my experience, understanding and ability in public meetings, due to which he has selected me
 iske liye jab unhone mujhe bulaayaa tha tab unke nirnay ke bare main mujhe koi jaankaree nahin thi
 He was sitting in the same chair where i am today
 main unase ek sammanjanak duuri par baithna chahta tha, lekin unhone kaha-''ye ab aapkaa ghar he
 i was stunned
 ''ham agar dharmanirpeksh mahagathbandhan kii baat karen to argedy or jedy (you) jaisi partiyaan, jo pehle ek-duusare se kadavi ladaai lard chuki hai, ab bijepi ke khilaaf apana astitv bachaane ke liye haath mila chuki hai
 People's belief is that this alliance of yours is irrational
 aapane yah kahawat to suni hi hogi: raajnneeti main koi bhi sthaayee dushman yaa dost nahin hota
 This is also true for life
 matbhed kitne bhi gahare kyon na hon, baatcheet kaa rasta nikal hi aata he
 Our alliance is also on the basis of principle, RJD, Congress and JD (U) have joined hands to defeat communal forces in the state
 dharmanirpeksh takaton ke bante hone kii vajah se hi vah ek baar janata ko bhramit karne main kaamyaab hui he
 Now we are united and BJP is not going to get any chance
 mahagathbandhan ek sachaai he, lekin yah bhi utana hi sach he ki nitish or lalu main matbhed itani gaharaai tak jaden jamaa chuke hai ki donon abhi tak ek-duusare se mili nahin hai
 He would have spoken on the phone, but the day Lalu organized the Iftar party, Nitish went out of the state a day before that
 yahaan tak ki aap bhi lalu kii iftaar party main nahin gaye
 This is a misconception
 maine iftaar party yojit kii thi to rabari mere ghar ai thim
 Now the election campaign has started
 apane ummidavaaron ke liye ham sanyukt rup se prachaar kar sakate hai
 You are often called a remote control chief minister
 pehle to sirf nitish hi the, lekin ab lalu prasad ke haath main bhi ek remote ho saktaa he
 Only those with anti-scheduled caste and scheduled tribe thinking are spreading such rumors
 hameshaa ek aisa varg rahaa he jo yah sochataa he ki anusuchit jati ke vyakti ke andar chizon ko thik se chalaane kii kaabiliyat nahin hoti
 You know that i have a big responsibility
 main anusuchit jati ke shashaktikaran kaa ek pratik hum
 The platform is trying to ensure that the Dalit community is never undermined
 agar main vifal hua to logon ko ek baar phir dalit samudaay ko kamatar aankane kaa mauka mil jayega
 But i will not let this happen
 abhi haal main sharad yadav ji ne mujhase kaha ki mukhyamantri ke rup main main itnaa zyada kaam kyon kar rahaa hum
 He told me not to spoil my health
 ye unka sneh tha
 But i know that my government has yet to achieve many more achievements
 ghadi kii sui chal rahi he or mujhe abhi milon janaa he
 i can not relax
 lekin do remote control ke bare main aap kya kahenge?main sabase pehle 1983 main shahari vikaas vibhaag main up-mantri bana tha
 It was only a few years that i came into politics
 ek din tatkaaleen mukhyamantri chandrashekhar singh kii patni manorama singh mere paas ain or unhone ek khaas file par apane manamafik aadesh jari karne ko kaha
 i listened to her, but i realized that what she is asking to do is not right
 isliye maine unke kahe ke vipareet aadesh de diya
 Cabinet Minister of our department Mahabir Chaudhary did not like to write anything else after seeing my comment
 chandrashekhar singh ne mujhe bulaayaa
 i told them the situation and said that i could not issue such an unfair order
 ve mujhase sahamat ho gaye
 i am not made of clay that can be operated by remote control
 aapke kaam main tanaav rahata hoga
 What do you do in free time, watch movies? i have pushed myself to fulfill the promises of the government
 mere paas sangeet or manoranjan ke liye bamushkil hi samay he
 Sometimes i watch discourses on the Aastha channel
 isliye achraj kii baat nahin he ki log aapako ek sharif, sidhaa netaa maanate hameb vaisaa bhi sidhaa nahin hum
 Direct means if there is a person who can be fooled, then do not make any mistake in this matter
 main us tarah kaa sidhaa nahin hum

 randeep ne bataaya ki deepa kisi rockstar se kam nahin
 They have no place for laziness and lazy people
 agar ve dekhati hai ki hamamen se koi bhi, jaraa bhi aalas dikhaa rahaa he to samajhie aap gaye kaam se
 Randeep wants his cross-border film to attract displaced people not only abroad but also from his country
 ve kehete hai, biba boij ek jeet johar naamak jat sikh kii jivan yatra he
 If i call it the protagonist of the film, it will not be wrong, who despite being a larger than life, is a gentleman who is connected to the ground
 randeep kii prem kahaniyanwaise randeep kaa naam jitna unki filmon ke liye janaa jaataa he utana hi unki garlfrends ke liye bhi
 These days, his name is being added to the film Biba Boy's with star Sarah Allen
 sara canada kii hai so apni canadian ko star ke saath link aps kii is khabar par randeep chutki lete hue kehete hai, sara kaaphi pyaari or talented ko-star hai or mujhe bahut pyaari bhi lagati hai
 At the moment we do not know what the news is saying, but yes we have decided that we will keep all our things hidden
 kik pehali 100 karodi filmkik ke 100 karod ru
 On joining k club, Randeep says, Kick is my first film which has joined 100 crore club so i feel as if i am on the seventh sky
 lekin sach to yah he ki iskaa puraa shrey salmaan bhai ko jaataa he
 It is his glory that people are going to watch the film for him and like me too
 vaise to darshak randeep kii pehali film ‘monsoon wedding’ se hi unki acting ke kaayal hai lekin ‘bombai tokis’, ‘hive’ or ab ‘kik’ main unke vividhtapurna kirdaaron ko dekhte hue sabhi unke abhinay kaa loha maan gaye hai
 After these films, Randeep's eyes are set on his next films 'rang Rasiya' and 'main Aur Charles'
 logon kii soch se alag hogi rangarasiyadiwali par shahrukh khan kii film ‘hapi new year’ ke saath relies hone ja rahi ‘rangarasia’ ko lekar randeep khaase utsahit hai
 After eight years, their hard work is going to bring color
 sitambar ke pehle hafte main bharat laut rahe randeep hooda hai, rang rasiyaa ko ham sabhi ne mehnat ke saath puure dil se banaaya he
 Rangarasiya is the story of King Ravi Varma who was a great painter
 jinhone na sirf mehalon balki aam logon ke gharon ko bhi apni chitrakaari main sthaan diya
 The pictures of the deities we have been worshiping for the last 100 years are due to them
 dilachasp baat to yah he ki bhartiya cinema ke pitamah dadasaheb phalke ne bhi unki kala ko apni filmon main yathochit sthaan diya tha
 i regret that the film is currently in the limelight due to the intimate scenes being shown in the film rather than his works
 kaaphi logon ko isse aitraaj bhi he, lekin sach kahuun to jinhen isse aitraaj he vah jab is film ko dekhenge tab samaj paaenge ki film main iske alaava bhi bahut kuch he

 The Akhil Bharatiya Congress Seva Dal has expressed its desire to give more time to this 8-decade-old organization from Rahul Gandhi, and Congress General Secretary and Seva Dal in-charge Mukul Wasnik on Monday demanded from party president Sonia Gandhi that he should ask Rahul Gandhi for the Seva Dal

 It is noteworthy that Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru was the first president of the Seva Dal and a few years ago during a Seva Dal conference in Karnataka, Rahul's sign of active politics was indicated when party general secretary Janardan Dwivedi demanded it

 com / olaeatk6n6— Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi (@naqvimukhtar)november 19, 2017desh main aisa pehali baar hoga jab mahilaayein bina purush ko saath liye haj par jaaengi
 Significantly, recently, the government had changed the rules of Haj pilgrimage, removing the ban on women going on Haj alone
 bina purush ke saath kehaj par jane keliye bas do sharten hai
 The first is that at least four women have to go to a group and second that all the women in the group should be over 45 years of age
 mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne bataaya ki modi sarkaar ne ye kadam isliye uthaaya kyonki kai mahilaayein chaah kar bhi is pabandi kii vajah se haj par nahin ja paati thim
 He said that there was some protest before this because there were some misunderstandings about it
 lekin saudi arab samet kai deshon main mahilaon ko purushon ke bina haj par jane kii ijaajat he
 The government has also made some other changes to make Haj pilgrimage easier for the people
 jaise ab is baat kii bhi pabandi nahin hogi ki jo jis jagah sehaj yatrake liye aavedan karegaa use usee jagah se yatra shuru kerani hogi
 Earlier, due to this ban, people from small places had to spend more to perform Haj
 nakvi ne bataaya ki jaise koi agar srinagar se haj yatra par jaataa he, to use philhal lagbhag ek lakh 20 hajaar rupee kharch karne hote hai
 But if the same person comes to Delhi at his own expense and goes on Haj from here, then his expenditure will be only 70 thousand
 mukhtaar abbaas nakvi ne ye bhi bataaya ki supreme court ke aadesh ke anusaar sarkaar haj sabsidi khatm karne kii ore bad rahi he
 The money spent in Haj subsidy will be spent in training of Muslim women

 The Congress and BJP called Farooqui's remarks 'ridiculous' and 'regrettable' and condemned him
 sapa netaa ne sawaal kiya, ‘kya yah giraftaar aparaadh ke aadhaar par he yaa dharm ke aadhaar par

 vaardaat ko us samay anjaam diya gaya jab gangster kii bivi apni 6 saal kii beti ko skool chhodane ke liye bas stop par pahunchi thi
 About 3 months ago, the gangster's wife filed a case against her own husband from the jail for threatening to kill her

 goli maarane vaale hamalaavaron ke bare main koi thos jaankaree to police ke haath nahin lag pai lekin itnaa zarur pataa lagane main safal ho gai he ki badmaashon ne vaardaat main centro car kaa istemaal kiya
 a new twist in this case came when the police received information that a centro car was found burning in Dhatir village under Palwal police station
 jaankaree milte hi gudgaanv police ke adhikari turant palaval ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye

 Just a day before the Narendra Modi Cabinet flagged off the Child Labor (restriction and Regulation) Amendment Bill - 2012 on May 13, an NGO conducted a raid to free 40 child laborers from Durgapuri area of the capital Delhi
 Of
 yahaan gharon main bachche bag or juute-chappal banane kaa kaam kar rahe the
 The children were freed, but within an hour, the parents and the local bullies together created such an atmosphere of chaos that most of the children fled in the presence of the police
 yah sthiti tab he jab bal mazdooree pratibandhit he or isamen maa-baap se lekar niyokta par bhi karrwai kaa praavdhaan he
 But the amendment towards which the Modi government is moving, not only has legal exemption for children working in family business, but the law is being softened
 haalanki kendriya shram or rojgaar mantri bandaaru dattatreya kehete hai, “ek taraf garibi he to duusari taraf suvidhaon kaa abhaav, isliye hamane mata-pita ko sangyeya aparaadh kii shrenee main nahin laane kaa vichaar kiya he
 Why the need for change arose In September 2011, the Supreme Court had asked the central and state governments to completely ban child labor, why not take such a step
 iske baad 2012 main tatkaaleen upie sarkaar ne bill taiyaar kar rajya sabha main pesh kiya tha
 Then the Parliamentary Standing Committee gave its recommendations on this, but this bill could not reach its end
 ab modi sarkaar ne usee bill main kuch nae bindu jode hai jise sansad ke monsoon satr main pesh kiya jayega or bill paas hua to yah 1986 ke kanoon kii jagah legaa
 The old law prohibits wages until the age of 14, but only in 18 occupations and 65 work processes
 isamen niyokta or mata-pita ko sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 But now this law will be combined with compulsory education law-2009
 yani 6 se 14 saal kii umr tak kaa baccha rojgaar main nahin jayega or agar anivaary shiksha kii umr main ijapha hota he to bal mazdooree kanoon main bhi umr kii seemaa swatah bad jaaegi
 The old law did not conform to the standards of the 138th and 182nd Conferences of the International Labor Organization (ILO)
 pehle kaa kanoon 14 saal se aage kii baat nahin karata tha
 But now Kishorevay (14 to 18 years) is kept away from risky work
 mantralay ke sanyukt sachiv dhiraj kumaar kehete hai, “pehle niyokta or mata-pita ke liye ek tarah kii sajaa thi
 Now the family situation has been taken care of for the parents
 ” unka kahana he ki baccha parivaar main “madad” karata he to vah gaiyr kanoonee nahin he, lekin use kisi kaam se jodna aparaadh mana jayega
 For the first time, the government has also made arrangements to create a rehabilitation fund for wage-free children
 kya hoga prabhavain sanshodhano kii jad main sabase zyada majaboor parivaar ke bachche aa sakate hai
 Swami Agnivesh, founder of Bandhu Mukti Morcha, says, “A child under 14 has his or her own childhood right
 buniyadi vikaas ke liye skool kii padhai ke alaava khelnaa-kudana, sapane bunana bhi hissaa hota he
 But this amendment will open the way for the exploitation of children
 ” unka maananaa he ki isse garib, pichde, dalit, adivasee pariwaron ke bachche prabhavit honge
 Therefore, social justice is advised not to make such amendments
 ve ise shiksha ke moulik adhikaron kaa hanan bhi qaraar dete hai
 While Bhuvan Ribhu, legal advisor of the Bachpan Bachao Andolan, says, "this is a commendable step towards a complete ban
 haalanki isamen or bhi behatar kiya ja saktaa tha
 "they believe that the Modi government has done nothing in this, it was an old bill, which has been introduced by the new government with new speed
" lekin kaamon kii suchi badhaai gai to sarkaar ko virodh jhelana pad saktaa he
 The Modi government has taken some protective provisions, taking steps towards a complete ban so that the law does not have a wrong effect
 inhen praavdhaanon main paariwarik kaarobaar (jokhim mukt) ko rakhaa he
 But the question is how to ensure that children will not be exploited in the family
 enciarabi ke aankade bataate hai ki bachche-bacchiyon ke shoshan main sabase zyada kareebi log hi shaamil hote hai
 Obviously, this bill will also be a big challenge of the Modi government

 There will inevitably be an impact of voters' sentiment on central and state government policies
 jiske nattejey main koi bhi kathin sudhaar jaise shram kanoon ko lacheela bananaa sambhav nahin hoga
 Therefore, Indian business should not set high expectations on this front

 This is the new home of the West Bengal government because the work of the British-era Writers Building, which has been the government's residence for the last 300 years, is undergoing repair work today - you may think that this city will be very happy or you will be happy We can see that perhaps the city would follow the same tune

 Unfortunately, the last few weeks have been extremely stressful for him as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) under the Supreme Court's directive in May 2014 was to raise Rs 10,000 crore

 In late December, the state Transport and Sports Minister Madan Mitra was arrested, while in mid-january, the party's general secretary and number two leader Mukul Roy was summoned by the CBI

 In an exclusive interview to India Today (see box), Banerjee has refuted allegations against her close colleagues, especially Roy, who is believed to be her right-hand man from West Bengal to Delhi
 unhone roy ke bare main kaha, ‘‘ve pratibha or budghimatta ke dhani hai
 He also said that the BJP is using the CBI to revenge against him and his party as the Kolkata Municipal Corporation elections are coming up and around April, elections will also be held in 90 other cities and towns of the state

 If she loses, there will be a serious threat to her party
 vidhansabha chunaav 2016 ke madhya main hone hai or chunautiyaan banerjee kii maand main ghusati najar aa rahi hai
 In mid-january, Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Manjul Krishna Thakur, who came from lower caste Matua, left the party and joined the BJP
 matua jati ke log mul rup se bangladeshi hai or unke kul 1 karod vot hai
 Then another favorite of Banerjee, Dinesh Trivedi, who was the Railway Minister in the Manmohan Singh government, and Birbhum MP Anupam Hazra are openly speaking against the party
 unhen shaayad yah ummid he ki is anushaasanheenata ke liye unhen party se nikaal diya jayega or tab ve dalbadal kanoon ke bhay se mukt hokar khuleam bijepi main shaamil ho sakenge
 As far as BJP is concerned, party chief Amit Shah has vowed to set fire to tmc's pandal
 jansangh ke sansthaapak shyama prasad mukherjee bhale bengal ke rahane vaale the lekin jansangh or bijepi kabhi bhi bengal main jaden nahin jamaa pai
 This reality is always causing prick in Amit Shah's heart, so he has a big aspiration to spread the party's feet there
 isi vajah se ve bengal fatah ke liye kuch bhi kar guzarane ko taiyaar hai
 So far, 14 lakh members have been made unexpectedly in the party membership campaign started in the state since January
 pichley vidhansabha chunaavon main 2011 tak party ke paas sirf 50,000 sadsy the
 The anticipation of what was happening in West Bengal was not so quick, especially because Banerjee had overthrown the powerful Left Front, which had been in power for 34 years, in 2011 with the slogan "poriberton"
 us vakt ve aandhi kii tarah ai thim
 It seemed as if they are present together here and there in white cotton saris and rubber thongs
 2007 main unhone taqatvar tata company ko aade haathon liya or singur main car kaarkaana lagane kii uski baari yojanaon par pani pher diya
 Then the then Communist Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, who had the audacious dream of being allowed to set up a factory on a multi-cropped 1,000 acres in lush Nandigram, was challenged
 lekin halaat kitni teji se badalte hai
 To show the courage to fight the Left Front, Mamata, who was once reverently called Didi in entire Bengal, has become synonymous with ridicule, condemnation and hate, at least in large parts of Kolkata
 mamata kaa gussa jag jaahir he or ve aksar hathe se ukhd jaati hai
 Transferring bureaucrats is his pastime and he is believed to have given his party workers a free hand to resort to violence if local panchayats do not listen to him
 aaj rajya main tolabhari shabd har kahin sunne ko mil jayega jiskaa matlab tiemasi ke sthaneey gundon ko di jane vaali niyamit rishwat he
 It is said that Banerjee does not tolerate criticism at all, especially from the media, who once praised him, it is not acceptable to criticize especially the powerful Anand Bazar Patrika Group, which he owns against Avik Sarkar
 Accuses of conspiring
 mana jaataa he ki unase alag hone or baad main sharada ghotaale main jude hone ke tathakthith aarope main police kii giraftaar se pehle unke kareebi sahyogi or saansad rahe kunal ghosh ne banerjee ko ek vaikalpik media pratishthan khadaa karne or chalaane kaa suzav diya tha taaki uske madhyam se unke prati ek swaabhaavik sahanubhuti kaa sanchaar kiya ja sake
 As the layers of the Saradha scandal unfolded, the story of alleged involvement in the scandal by other TMC leaders, including Madan Mitra, Kunal Ghosh, Srinjoy Bose, Mukul Roy's aide Asif Khan and former Inspector General of Police Rajat Majumdar, came to the surface
 yahi nahin, ab sibiai ne sharada ke maalik sudipto sen se parichay ke aadhaar par poochtacha ke liye mukul roy ko talab kiya he, to yah saaf ho gaya he ki banerjee ke gale main fanda kasata ja rahaa he
 As a TMC leader said on the condition of anonymity, "is spring too far, will spring be too far?" But the reality is that whatever the idiom Amit Shah might do in rural Bengal TMC will not be able to challenge the strength of cadres at the ground level
 sachaai yah bhi he ki banerjee ne jangalmahal (jahaan 2011 ke chunaavon ke dauraan swayambhu maovadiyon kaa kabja tha) ke alaava darjeeling or kuchbihar jilon main bhi sadakon or bijli ke taron kaa jaal bicha diya he or vahaan vikaas ko saakaar kar ke dikhaaya he
 He has also launched many positive schemes in the field of education, including the scheme for students belonging to obcs in higher education, especially "kanyashree", under which 18 years to save girls from child marriage

 21 lakh adolescent girls have benefited from this scheme
 is yojana par kendrit ek jhaanki dilli main ganatantr diwas kii parade ke liye prastaavit kii gai thi, jise centre sarkaar ne parade main shaamil nahin kiya
 The TMC has been inundated and has accused the Modi government of giving preference to the BJP ruled states
 banerjee ne rajya ke har aspataal main dawa kii dukaane khole jane kaa nirdesh diya he jahaan davaaiyaan 67 fisadi saste daam main milengi or unki gunvattta par puraa niyantran rakhaa jayega
 Our interview with Banerjee begins in a very intimate atmosphere, sitting behind a huge glass table in her very simple office on the fourteenth floor at Secretariat Nabbano
 daftar itnaa sada he ki yahaan rabindranath tagore kaa ek adad chitra yaa print tak nahin laga he
 He ordered roasted fish for this reporter, and soon tea is also served in small hand-made ceramic cups
 banerjee sakuchaate hue bataati hai ki kolkata ke nae hawaii adde sthit ek dukaan se unhone khud ye cap kharide the
 The atmosphere had become such that the entire mood of shma-mati-manushi was coming, the same slogan he had given in 2007 during the "agitation" of Singur and Nandigram
 unka vajan itnaa ghat gaya he ki ve kamjor dikh rahi hai
 She explains that this is not due to any stress, but because of walking 10 kilometers on a treadmill daily
 baithe-baithe haalanki ve ek haath kii mutthi baandh kar duusari hatheli main is tarah se ghumaati hai ki is mudra se saaf samaj main aa jaataa he ki bengal main kuch gadabad chal rahaa he
 We start the conversation with her books (so far she has written 52 books, of which six books were written last year)
 yah jaanane kii koshish karte hai ki apane kamare kii diwaar par unhone apni banaai tasviir kyon nahin lagaai he (iskar vibhag ke record ke mutabik sudipto sen ne unki banaai ek painting 1
 8 crores Rs
 main kharidi thi)
 Gangasagar talks about the fair how he managed it so successfully (in this three-day fair, 21 lakh pilgrims from all over the country reached the island where the river Ganges falls in the Bay of Bengal)
 unke kamare ke duusare kone par shishe kii vishaal khidki se baahar damakati hui nadi ke upar hughali kaa doosraa pul hilta-sa dikhataa he or yah sab milakar is dopaher kii baatcheet ko kaaphi sukun bharaa bana rahaa he
 Suddenly the conversation comes on the Saradha scam and the whole atmosphere changes
 yah puche jane par ki roy ko sibiai ne kyon bulaayaa or kya ve sudipto sen se mili the (sen ke us bayaan kaa khandan roy ne ab tak nahin kiya he ki vah jab bhagkar kashmir main chipa hua tha to usne 86 baar roy se baat kii) banerjee aisi pratikriya detii hai jaise ki unke saath koi bahut bada dhokhaa kiya gaya he
 She explodes, "the BJP is deliberately targeting my organization and trying to discredit me
" lekin kisi gafalat main mat rahiega, ham palat kar jawaab denge
 Will fight against land acquisition law in and outside Parliament
 hamen pravartan nideshaalay kaa dar nahin he
 We had given birth to a movement
 jo koi bhi aisa kar rahaa he, use nateeja bhugatna hi hoga
 "he did the last fatal attack after saying so much," What do you think, Amit Shah got a clean chit from the CBI when he was accused of murder in Gujarat? "another TMC leader refused to be named
 "on the one hand he has loyal and close associates like Madan Mitra and Mukul Roy to whom he is committed
 duusari ore inaki sharada ghotaale main bhagidaari kii ashanka bhi he
 Mamta is trapped between the two
 ’’ isiilie jab yah saaf ho gaya ki mitra ko giraftaar kiya ja saktaa he to unhen cabinet kii baithkon main bulaanaa band kar diya gaya jabaki sibiai kaa saman aane ke baad roy ko saarvajanik manchon se dur kar diya gaya
 Leaders like MP Subrata Bakshi, Urban Development Minister Farhad "bobby" Hakim, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee, Finance Minister Amit Mitra, his own nephew Abhishek Banerjee and party spokesperson and MP Derek o'brien are among the loyalists Leading the party
 iske baavjood mamata ke bheetar yah ehsaas gaharaa he ki sharada ghotaale main sibiai jaanch sambandhi supreme court kaa nirdesh darasal unke khilaaf ek suniyojit sajeesh he
 Finance Minister Mitra explains that the scandal came to light long before the TMC came to power in 2011 and they wonder why entities like SEBI, RBI and Registrar of Companies did nothing about it
 isiilie jab sibiai ne mukul roy ko bulaayaa, to banerjee ne palatwaar karne kii thaanee or supreme court se guhaar lagaai ki vah is jaanch kii nigaraanee kare
 "the bjp's strategy is to hurt Didi's popularity, tarnish her image," says Mitra
 ’’ ve ishaara karte hai ki jab tiemasi satta main ai thi to use viraasat main barbaad bengal mila tha jahaan kam-se-kam 58,000 kaarkaane band ho chuke the or badi maatra main puunji rajya se baahar ja chuki thi
 Mitra's efforts after this have resulted in significant results
 ve bataate hai ki kar sangrah 21,000 karod ru
 Nearly doubled to Rs 40,000 crore
 par pahunch chukaa he, rajakoshiya ghaataa 4
 3 down from 12 per cent
 08 fisadi par aa gaya he, puunjigat vyay shunya se 26
 08 per cent, which has risen to 103 per cent and the Industrial Production Index 6
 3 fisadi badha he
 Much of the money has been spent on improving infrastructure, including roads and highways
 saath hi 31 college, chah nae vishvavidhyalay or 195 audyogic prashikshan santhaan khole gaye hai
 Mitra strongly defends private sector investment promises during the Bengal Global Business Summit held in early January, a total of 2
 43 lakh karod ru
 93,329 crore out of Rs
 kii raashi he, lekin ve is dharna ko nahin tod pate ki bengal main laghu or chote udyogon ko hi acha mana jaataa he
 This notion is born out of the political struggle of the Chief Minister
 singur main jo sangharsh chalaa, jisase mamata ne vammorche ko satta se hataane main kamyaabi pai thi, uskaa saaya ab tak sarkaar par mandara rahaa he
 Harsh Neotia, one of the richest businessmen in the state, who was also a member of the Chief Minister's Steering Committee for the spread of Global Summit, says that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is a firm sympathizer of the poor and believes that she needs more support than the rich
 is
 ek anya kaarobaari ne haalanki naam na chhapane kii shart par kaha ki ‘‘samasya yah he ki ve hameshaa se hi jamini netaa rahi hai or unhen aarthik prakriyaaon kii koi samaj nahin he
 According to him, the importance of the handloom industry is the same as that of the automobile industry
 ’’jadhavpur se saansad or harvard main professor sugto bose kaa maananaa he ki tiemasi ‘‘sangheey ekta kaa najariya pesh kar sakati he or vanchiton ke aarthik hiton kii raksha kar sakati he jabaki modi ke netritv vaali bijepi bade kaarobaariyon kii himachati he
 
 
 There has to be a balance, but only the corruption-free TMC can fight the bjp's majoritarianism
 ’’bose kaa ishaara sharada ghotaale ke aropiyon kii ore tha jinka mukhyamantri bachaav kar rahi hai or isse party main samasyaayein paidaa ho rahi hai
 The Chief Minister undoubtedly understands that the notion of being corrupt is as deadly as actually being corrupted and at least Kolkata has probably decided that the time has come to get rid of this arbitrary memes
 isse koi fark nahin padataa ki unke raaj main shahar kahin zyada saaf-suthra ho gaya he
 There is an all-round discussion that he is a tremendous hit on Tollywood, the film industry of Kolkata and this creates an atmosphere against him
 kul paanch abhinayta aaj kii taarikh main loksabhaa sadsy hai-bankuda se munmun sen, medinipur se sandhya roy, birbhum se shatabdi roy, krishnanagar se taapas paul or ghataal se deepak dev adhikari-jabaki bangla gayak indranil sen, anshkalik film nirmaataa shibaji panja or film vitarak shrikant mohataa ko banerjee kii andruni toli kaa sadsy bataaya jaataa he
 That is why the Assembly elections may be more than a year away, but the war of Bengal has started
 banerjee apane votaron ko ekajute karne main jute gai hai-30-31 fisadi musalmaan vot ko ve jodgaye kii koshish main hai or un jilon main lagaataar daure kar rahi hai jahaan unhen ummid he ki votaron par unki aalochana karne vaali media kaa asar nahin hoga
 They know that the upcoming election is a matter of do or die
 pichley aam chunaavon main bhale hi sipiem ko 29 fisadi vot pade hon jabaki bijepi ko sirf 17 fisadi
 But Banerjee knows well that the CPM has become a party of the past
 iske alaava, tiemasi ke gundon ne kathith taur par sipiem ke kai ahm kaaryakartaaon kii hatya kar di he, jiske chalate jamini kaaryakartaaon or party ke varisht netaaon kaa sampark tut chukaa he
 As far as the BJP is concerned, it is hopeful that under the leadership of Amit Shah, it will be able to easily defeat Banerjee, who currently seems to be her own worst enemy
 banerjee bijepi par chaturaai se hamalaa karne kii bajaae apana aapa kho de rahi hai
 The BJP is getting its natural benefits in return and the opposition is cleverly hiding its anti-female character by publicizing her image of being an intolerant and arrogant politician
 itnaa to tay he ki mamata banerjee ab koi nayaa avatar nahin le saktin
 She can definitely restore her image within the party by expelling people from her party and declare that she will not tolerate corruption
 kuch saal pehle unhone kolkata main balaatkaar kii shikaar ek ladki ke khilaaf jo samvedanheen bayaan diya tha, uske liye ve bengal kii auraton se maafee maang sakati hai
 She can return to her agitational image (some might say she is still there) and fight her way best against the emerging BJP as well as the remaining Left Front
 unhone raajnneeti main parivartan kaa naaraa diya tha
 Today it should start from itself
 agar unhone yah mahasoos karne se inkaar kar diya ki badlaav kaa centre khud ve hai, tab to apni tiemasi ke saath ve umadte sailaab main itihaas ke gart main mil jaaengi

 magar 'bajirao mastaani' ko tarifein mil rahi hai
 'dilwale' does not have repeat value, so 'bajirao Mastani' collection is increasing

 bhartiya janata party ke rashtriya sachiv tarun chugh ne kaha, 'bihar ke nateezon kaa punjab par koi asar nahin padegaa, hamaara gathbandhan majboot he
 ' shiromani akali dal ke khilaaf jabardast satta virdohi lahar ko dekhte hue bijepi ne punjab main akele chunaav ladane kii yojana bana rahi thi
 The Sangh is busy building a ground base in the villages, but now it seems that all these exercises will be defeated
 tippaniyan Political analyst Dr
 pramod kumaar kehete hai ki bijepi ke kamazor hone se akali dal jaisi kshetreey dalon ko phayda hua he
 Now their question will increase, bjp's attitude will change and NDA will remain in Punjab
 ' Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not shared the stage with the Badal family after the Lok Sabha elections
 punjab ko aarthik package, kisaanon ko muawza jaisi maangon par modi sarkaar ne zaraa bhi tavajjon nahin di
 After Bihar, the Akalis have returned to the spring

 raajnneetik vishleshak dow
 Pramod Kumar says regional parties like the Akali Dal have benefited from the bjp's weakening
 ab unki puch badhegi, bijepi kaa ravaiya badalegaa or punjab main endie bana rahegaa
 ' loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi ne badal parivaar ke saath manch saajha nahin kiya he
 The Modi government did not pay any attention to the demands like economic package to Punjab, compensation to farmers
 bihar ke baad akali dal ke liye bahaaren laut aayi hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not shared the stage with the Badal family after the Lok Sabha elections
 punjab ko aarthik package, kisaanon ko muawza jaisi maangon par modi sarkaar ne zaraa bhi tavajjon nahin di
 After Bihar, the Akalis have returned to the spring
 chhattisgarh ke colectoron ko pradhanmantri ke saamne chashma pahanane par notice dene kii khabar aate hi soshal media par un tasveeron kii talash shuru ho gai jinamein pradhanmantri khud chashma pahane hue hai
 Probably, the Prime Minister was seen hugging the glasses over the forehead
 ek kism kii anaupchaarikta nazar aa rahi he
 In another picture, he is in glasses while meeting another head of state
 colector ke chashme ke mukaable pradhanmantri kii chashme vaali in tasveeron ko pesh kiya ja rahaa tha yah bataane ke liye khud chashma pahane to thik lekin colector pahane to gunaah
 Somewhere it was also seen that Jawaharlal Nehru is under supervision of some plan
 unke saath colector band galaa main nazar aa rahe hai magar kaala chashma pahane hue hai
 An attempt was made to show how tolerant Nehru is in this matter and how intolerant Prime Minister Modi is
 yah udhaaharan isliye nahin diya ki mujhe chhattisgarh ke colectoron ke chashma pahanane par kuch kahana he balki isliye ki photo raajnneeti kii nai bhashaa ke rup main ubharne laga he
 Any dispute is being fought in social media in two ways
 ek toli aglaa-pichhlaa bayaan or pramaan nikaal laati he
 The second team appears to present several photographs in favor and opposition to that dispute
 tasveeron ke zariye ek duusare ko sahi yaa galat sabit kiya jane lagata he
 Real-fake photos are also pushed in this sequence
 siyaasi ladaai ke nae kaarakaanon main photoshaap takanic zarur hathiyaar ban gaya he
 You will find many pictures of Gandhi, Nehru and Modi on social media which have been tampered with through photoshop technique
 yah mahatvapurn nahin he ki koun si party ke log pehle yaa zyada karte hai
 Political morality is also not important for you or the voter
 aap bhi is maamle main suvidha yaa nishtha ke hisaab se line tay karte hai
 All in all, there was a strong campaign to tarnish the image of Gandhi and Nehru as if these leaders were not in the finer points of history but in these pictures only as good and bad
 ab to aae din pradhanmantri modi, rahul gandhi or arvind kejariwal ko gherne ke liye unki asli or banaavati tasviren paidaa kii jaati hai or yahaan vahaan se jodakar raajnneetik daleelein
 Our newspapers have kept the tradition of photography alive at all costs
 tab bhi jab har kisi ke haath main mobile camera pahunch gaya he
 No photo can be imagined without a photo
 khaaskar indian express ke kai photographer kii tasveeron ko bahut dhyaan se dekhtaa rahata hum
 If photographer Praveen Jain were not there, today we would not have a picture of the Hashimpura massacre in Meerut
 ve tasviren hi antim pramaan ke rup main maujuud hai
 It is another matter that the stomach of the system is so deep and the intestines so complex that this evidence could not work
 usee tarah se praveen khanna, toshi, anil sharma kii tasviren us raajnneetik gaharaai ko utaar laati hai jise bayaan karne ke liye lekhakon ko kitni mehnat kerani hoti he
 But now everyone is a photographer
 har koi he to hamaare netaa bhi ab photographer hai
 If you take a picture of them, they will take their selfie with you
 wo isliye karte hai kyonki photo soshal media kii sabase badi bhashaa he
 There is a limit of words in social media mediums and where there are no boundaries, there is no endurance to write too long
 lihaaza har tasviir ek nae lekh yaa kitaab kaa kaam karne lagi he
 Social media is not in front of TV
 iskaa matlab yah nahin ki usne dekhne kii ichha se mukti paa liya he
 He is eradicating the hunger of TV through these pictures
 tivi tak pahunchate pahunchate wo khabar or tasviir donon se vaakif ho chukaa hota he
 The political behavior of people on social media is changing due to the photo
 ve apane netaa ke saath kii tasviir lagaate hai
 They are also putting a picture of the leader
 isliye netaa bhi rochak tasviren paidaa kar rahe hai
 People make the controversial picture a profile picture in an instant
 koi samarthan ke taur par kisi photo ko lagaataa he to koi virodh ke liye
 The same photo is being used differently
 koi un tasveeron par ek pankti kii tippanee chipka de rahaa he to koi do tasveeron se apane apane netaa ko mahaan bataa rahaa he
 Due to the limitation of words or the sluggishness of writing, photographs have started to be widely used
 shabdon kii tulana main tasviren zyada bolne lagi hai
 You can easily upload a photo on Twitter or Whats Up
 baaten ek palak or ek jhalak main saafe ho ja rahi hai
 The comments hamaare netaa bhi isi zarurat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue photo-utpaadan par khaas dhyaan de rahe hai
 a photo rally begins before their journey or rally begins
 har raajnneetik gatividhi ko photo main badla ja rahaa he yaa photo ko dhyaan main rakhkar raajnneetik gatividhiyaan plan kii ja rahi hai
 Politicians are filling this space created through public in social media with their pictures
 ye tasviren hi vahaan unki maujuudagi kaa kaam kar rahi hai
 Sometimes in the form of a selfie and sometimes by taking pictures taken of someone
 netaa ab apni chhavi khud hi bana rahaa he
 You can read these images in many ways
 aapke netaa anaupchaarik, kool dikhne kaa prayaas karte hai to saath hi koob kaam karne vaala bhi
 Some are drawn with the poor and some with the players
 ab tasveeron ko bhi takat ke paimaane par aanka ja rahaa he
 The selfie of the Prime Minister of India and Premier of China has been described as the most powerful picture ever
 tasviir ke taqatvar hone kaa kya paimaana hota he kisi ko nahin maaloom lekin agar aap in tasveeron ke mahatv par dhyaan nahin denge to apane samay kii raajnneetik bhashaa ko nazarandaaz kar jaayenge
 Politics and leaders have not changed much
 wo itnaa hi badale hai ki aaj kii duniya kii nigahon ke anusaar dhal gaye hai
 As we are
 ham bhi to vahi karte hai
 Instead of reaching somewhere and looking at the place properly or imbibing, they immediately take pictures from mobile and update them on Facebook and Whats Up
 nazadik pahunch kar bhi koi ji bhar kar nahin dekhtaa
 All one frame is crazy behind a picture
 us frem main ab wo khud bhi hai jise ham selfi kehete hai
 a leader becomes a messiah by drawing a picture with a poor person, and a villain with pictures moving among the rich
 har kshan ek nai chhavi kaa utpaadan ho rahaa he
 So many images are made that a normal mind would not be able to make any logical decision about that leader
 shaayad isiilie raajnneeti main bhavukta bachi rah jaati he thik usee tarah jaise photo bachaa rah gaya or ab us photo se netaa khud ko bachaa rahe hai
 Long ago when i said during a telecast that selfie is a national disease, many viewers got thereafter
 sabane is pankti kaa zikr kiya lekin saath main yah bhi nivedan kiya ki bas ek tasviir to banati he aapke saath
 i take it but at the same time keep studying that what is there is not changing
 phir badal koun rahaa he
 Is it someone else or someone else whose selfie has not reached us
 log sirf ek frem ko hi satya maanakar khush hai
 Perhaps this is the present day practice and Fitoor
 darasal maine galat kaha tha
 Selfie is not a national disease, it is also a political disease
 hamaari parampara main ek sukh rog kaa bhi chalan he
 When there is no disease, get a disease for the disease
 selfi hamaare samay kaa sukhrog he
 This example is not given because i have something to say about the collectors of Chhattisgarh wearing glasses but because photo has started emerging as a new language of politics
 kisi bhi vivaad ko soshal media main do tareeke se ladaa jane laga he
 a team brings out the next-previous statement and evidence
 duusari toli us vivaad ke paksh-vipaksh main kai tasveeron ko pesh karne lagati he
 Through photos, each other is proved to be right or wrong
 is kram main asli-nakli tasviren bhi thel di jaati hai
 In the new factories of political battle, photoshop technology has definitely become a weapon
 gandhi nehru or modi kii aapako soshal media par kai tasviren milengi jinase photoshaap takanic ke zariye chhedchhad kii gai hoti he
 It is not important which party people do first or more
 aap darshak yaa matadaata ke liye bhi raajnneetik naitikta mahatvapurn nahin he
 You also decide the line according to convenience or loyalty in this case
 kul milakar gandhi or nehru kii chhavi ko karaab karne kaa koob abhiyaan chalaa jaise ye netaa itihaas kii baarikiyon main nahin balki in tasveeron main hi achche bure ke taur par darj hai
 Now a days, to capture Prime Minister Modi, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal, real and fabricated pictures of them are produced and political arguments are added here
 hamaare akhbaaron ne photography kii parampara ko har keemat par zindaa rakhaa he
 Even when a mobile camera has reached everyone's hands
 photo ke bina kisi akhbaar kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati
 Especially i keep watching the photographs of many photographers of Indian Express very carefully
 photographer praveen jain nahin hote to aaj hamaare paas meerut ke hashimpura narsanhaar kii tasviir hi nahin hoti
 Those photographs exist only as a final proof
 ye or baat he ki system kaa pet itnaa gaharaa or aanten itani jatil hai ki ye pramaan kisi kaam nahin aa sakaa
 In the same way, pictures of Praveen Khanna, Toshi, Anil Sharma bring out the political depth that writers have to work hard to tell
 par ab har koi photographer he
 If everyone is there then our leaders are also photographers
 aap unki tasviir kheechenge to ve aapke saath apni selfi khinch lenge
 They do this because photo is the biggest language of social media
 soshal media ke madhyamon main shabdon kii seemaa he or jahaan seemaa nahin hai vahaan bhi lanbaa lanbaa likhane kaa dhiraj nahin he
 So every picture has started working as a new article or book
 soshal media kaa praani tivi ke saamne nahin he
 This does not mean that he has got rid of the desire to see
 wo in tasveeron ke zariye tivi kii bhukh mitaa rahaa he
 On reaching TV, he has become aware of both the news and the picture
 photo ke kaaran soshal media ke logon kaa raajnneetik vyavhaar badal rahaa he
 They photograph with their leader
 netaa kii bhi tasviir laga rahe hai
 So the leaders are also producing interesting pictures
 log pal bhar main vivaadaaspad tasviir ko profile tasviir bana lete hai
 Someone puts up a photo as a support, and someone opposes
 ek hi photo kaa alag-alag istamaal ho rahaa he
 Some people are pasting one line comment on those pictures and some are telling their leader as great with two pictures
 shabdon kii seemaa yaa likhane ke aalas ke kaaran tasveeron kaa vyapak istamaal hone laga he
 Pictures are starting to speak more than words
 aap twitor yaa whats ap par aasaani se ek photo aplod kar sakate hai
 Things are clearing in a wink and a glance
 tippaniyan Keeping this need in mind, our leaders are paying special attention to photo-production
 unki yatra yaa raily shuru hone se pehle hi photo kii raily shuru ho jaati he
 Every political activity is being converted into a photo or political activities are being planned keeping in mind the photo
 rajaneta soshal media main public ke zariye ban rahe is spes ko apni tasveeron se bhar rahe hai
 These pictures are working for his presence there
 kabhi selfi ke rup main to kabhi kisi kii khinchi hui tasveeron ko aage badhaakar
 The leader is now building his own image
 aap in chhaviyon ko kai tareeke se pard sakate hai
 If your leaders try to appear informal, cool, then they also do good work
 koi garibon ke saath khinchaa rahaa he to koi khilaadiyon ke saath
 Now photographs are also being judged on the strength scale
 bharat ke pradhanmantri or china ke premier kii selfi ko ab tak kii sabase taqatvar tasviir bataai gai he
 No one knows what is the scale of the picture being powerful, but if you do not pay attention to the importance of these pictures, then you will ignore the political language of your time
 raajnneeti or netaa bahut nahin badale hai
 They have changed so much that they have changed according to the eyes of today's world
 jaise ham vaise ve
 We also do the same
 kahin pahunch kar jagah ko thik se dekhne yaa aatmsaat karne ke bajaae turant mobile se photo khinch kar fasebuk or whats ap par apadet karne lagate hai
 Even after reaching close, no one looks at it with full enthusiasm
 sab bas ek frem ek tasviir ke peeche diwane hai
 In that frame we now also have what we call a selfie
 koi netaa ek garib ke saath tasviir khinchaa kar maseehaa ban jaataa he to koi amiron ke bich chalati hui tasveeron se khalanaayak
 a new image is being produced every moment
 itani chhaviyaan ban jaati hai ki ek saamaanya dimag is laayak hi nahin bachataa hoga ki wo us netaa ke bare main koi taarkik faisla kare
 Perhaps that is why sentimentality remains in politics, just as the photo was left and now the leaders are protecting themselves from that photo
 bahut pehle jab maine ek prasaaran ke dauraan kaha tha ki selfi ek rashtriya rog he to uske baad kai darshak mili
 Everyone mentioned this line but also requested that a picture is made with you
 main khinchaa to letaa hum magar saath hi yah bhi adhyayan karte rahata hum ki jo jahaan he wo to badal nahin rahaa he
 Then who is changing
 wo koi or he yaa kahin or he jisaki selfi hamaare tak nahin pahunchi he
 People are happy to accept only one frame as the truth
 shaayad yahi aaj kaa dastur or fitoor he
 Actually i was wrong
 selfi ek rashtriya rog nahin he, yah ek raajnneetik rog bhi he
 There is also a trend of happiness in our tradition
 jab koi rog na ho to rog ke liye ek rog paal lo
 Selfie is the beauty of our time
 siyaasi ladaai ke nae kaarakaanon main photoshaap takanic zarur hathiyaar ban gaya he
 You will find many pictures of Gandhi, Nehru and Modi on social media which have been tampered with through photoshop technique
 yah mahatvapurn nahin he ki koun si party ke log pehle yaa zyada karte hai

 sabane is pankti kaa zikr kiya lekin saath main yah bhi nivedan kiya ki bas ek tasviir to banati he aapke saath
 i take it but at the same time keep studying that what is there is not changing
 phir badal koun rahaa he
 Is it someone else or someone else whose selfie has not reached us
 log sirf ek frem ko hi satya maanakar khush hai
 Perhaps this is the present day practice and Fitoor
 darasal maine galat kaha tha
 Selfie is not a national disease, it is also a political disease
 hamaari parampara main ek sukh rog kaa bhi chalan he
 When there is no disease, get a disease for the disease
 selfi hamaare samay kaa sukhrog he
 Keeping this need in mind, our leaders are paying special attention to photo-production
 unki yatra yaa raily shuru hone se pehle hi photo kii raily shuru ho jaati he
 Every political activity is being converted into a photo or political activities are being planned keeping in mind the photo
 rajaneta soshal media main public ke zariye ban rahe is spes ko apni tasveeron se bhar rahe hai
 These pictures are working for his presence there
 kabhi selfi ke rup main to kabhi kisi kii khinchi hui tasveeron ko aage badhaakar
 The leader is now building his own image
 aap in chhaviyon ko kai tareeke se pard sakate hai
 If your leaders try to appear informal, cool, then they also do good work
 koi garibon ke saath khinchaa rahaa he to koi khilaadiyon ke saath
 Now photographs are also being judged on the strength scale
 bharat ke pradhanmantri or china ke premier kii selfi ko ab tak kii sabase taqatvar tasviir bataai gai he
 No one knows what is the scale of the picture being powerful, but if you do not pay attention to the importance of these pictures, then you will ignore the political language of your time
 raajnneeti or netaa bahut nahin badale hai
 They have changed so much that they have changed according to the eyes of today's world
 jaise ham vaise ve
 We also do the same
 kahin pahunch kar jagah ko thik se dekhne yaa aatmsaat karne ke bajaae turant mobile se photo khinch kar fasebuk or whats ap par apadet karne lagate hai
 Even after reaching close, no one looks at it with full enthusiasm
 sab bas ek frem ek tasviir ke peeche diwane hai
 In that frame we now also have what we call a selfie
 koi netaa ek garib ke saath tasviir khinchaa kar maseehaa ban jaataa he to koi amiron ke bich chalati hui tasveeron se khalanaayak
 a new image is being produced every moment
 itani chhaviyaan ban jaati hai ki ek saamaanya dimag is laayak hi nahin bachataa hoga ki wo us netaa ke bare main koi taarkik faisla kare
 Perhaps that is why sentimentality remains in politics, just as the photo was left and now the leaders are protecting themselves from that photo
 bahut pehle jab maine ek prasaaran ke dauraan kaha tha ki selfi ek rashtriya rog he to uske baad kai darshak mili
 Everyone mentioned this line but also requested that a picture is made with you
 main khinchaa to letaa hum magar saath hi yah bhi adhyayan karte rahata hum ki jo jahaan he wo to badal nahin rahaa he
 Then who is changing
 wo koi or he yaa kahin or he jisaki selfi hamaare tak nahin pahunchi he
 People are happy to accept only one frame as the truth
 shaayad yahi aaj kaa dastur or fitoor he
 Actually i was wrong
 selfi ek rashtriya rog nahin he, yah ek raajnneetik rog bhi he
 There is also a trend of happiness in our tradition
 jab koi rog na ho to rog ke liye ek rog paal lo
 Selfie is the beauty of our time

 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke aakhri charan kaa chunaav 19 may ko khatm ho gaya
 Now in Exit Poll 2019, it will be known where the wind is moving
 kis party kii sarkaar ban rahi he
 However the result 23 will be known only after counting
 kai deshon main opinian pole kaa chalan 1940 ke dashak se hone laga tha
 Exit Polls are covered under Opinion Polls, but the method of sampling is different in both
 bharat main agsit pole kaa khaakaa 1960 main khinchaa gaya he
 It was prepared by the Center for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS)
 jabaki 1980 ke madhya main us vakt chartered acount se patrkaar bane pranay roy ne matadaataaon kii nabj tatolane kii koshish kii thi
 This was the beginning of exit polls in India
 shuruaati daur main jo bhi eczit pole hote the ve india today megsine main pramukhataa se chaape jate the
 In the 1996 Lok Sabha elections, the CSDS indicated in the exit poll a fractured mandate which was absolutely correct
 is chunaav main bhartiya janata party (BJP) sabase badi party banakar to ubhari, lekin bahumat se dur rahi
 The President invited Atal Bihari Vajpayee to form the government
 sarkaar bani, lekin mahaj 13 din main hi yah sarkaar gir gai he
 After this, HD Deve Gowda and Indra Kumar Gujral formed the UPA government
 kitne khare utarate hai agsit pole?1990 ke dashak main televijan kaa prasar or raajnneetik anischitata ne chunaav ke baad agsit pole ko lokapriy bana diya
 In the 1998 Lok Sabha elections, almost every major news TV channel did exit polls
 1998 ke lok sabha chunaav main chaar badi chunavi survey karne vaali agenciyaan India Today / CSDS, DRS, Outlook / AC Nielsen or Frontline / CMS ne apane survey main bijepi nit endie ko badi party bataai thi, lekin 272 ke jaadui aankade tak nahin pahunchaaya tha
 In the exit poll, the NDA was projected to get between 214-249 seats and the Congress-led UPA 145-164 seats
 is chunaav main NDA ko 252 or congress ko 166 siten hi mili thim
 Similar polls were held before the 1999 Lok Sabha elections
 isamen India Today / insight, HT-AC Nielsen, Times poll / DRS, pioneer-rdi or Outlook / CMS jaisi agenciyon ne endie ko 300 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya
 Atal Bihari NDA got 296 seats in this election
 jabik upie ko 134 siten mili thim
 While the math of getting 132–150 seats was applied in the survey
 survey agenciyon ne tisare number par aane vaali party ko 34-95 tak samet diya tha jabaki yahaan anumaan puri tarah se fail ho gaya tha
 The third party had won 113 seats
 jab dharashayi ho gaye saare agsit polschunavi survey agenciyon ke liye 2004 kaa lok sabha sabase zyada niraash karne vaala tha
 In this election, assessments of all agencies had failed
 ise sabase bada felyor mana gaya
 All the agencies had predicted to get the mandate again to the NDA, giving the slogan of 'india Shining'
 rigelt ke din endie 200 kaa aankada bhi nahin chhu pai thi
 Even after winning the Kargil war in 1999, the NDA was reduced to 189 seats
 is chunaav main 222 siten hasil karne vaali upie ne samaajawaadee party (SP) or bahujan samaaj party (BSP) ke sahyog se satta hasil kii
 The 2009 Lok Sabha election was also a failure of survey agencies
 is chunaav main agenciyon ne UPA ko 199 or NDA ko 197 siten milane kaa kayaas lagaaya tha
 While the UPA managed to win the trust of the people in 262 parliamentary seats taking a tremendous lead
 endie ko 159 siton par santosh karnaa padaa tha
 Exit poll agencies blossomed again in 2014 The Modi wave was projected in exit polls in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 zyaadaatar agsit pols main sabhi ne bhaajapa nit endie kii jeet ko sunishchat qaraar diya tha
 An agency had made a perfect guess in it
 agency ne bijepi ko 291 or endie ko 340 siten milane kaa anumaan lagaaya tha
 Of the 543 seats on the day of result, BJP had got 282 seats and NDA got 336 seats
 isamen upie 59 siton par simat kar rah gai thi
 While the estimate was to get 97–135 seats
 isamen congress ko 44 siten mili thim
 Now what will happen in the evening of Hogarivar? Again, political pundits apply their electoral mathematics
 ravivaar ko 2019 loksabhaa ke aakhri charan ke chunaav khatm ho jaaenge
 All TV channels will bring exit polls from 6 pm
 par asal nattejey ke liye aapako 23 may tak intjaar karnaa padegaa
 What is Opinion Poll? Opinion Poll is directly connected to the voter
 isamen janata kii raay ko samajhane ke liye alag-alag tareeke se aankade ekattha kiya jaataa he
 That is, different ways of talking to people, knowing their opinions are adopted
 pre pole, agsit pole or post pole opinian pole kii teen shakhaaen hai
 But most people consider exit poll and post poll to be the same, but this is not the case
 ye donon ek-duusare bilkul alag hote hai
 Every news of the election will be received directly in your inbox

 dilli hoicourt main vaayu pradooshan ke maamle main sunwaayee karte hue court ne sarkaar se poocha he ki ab tak aapane kya kiya he
 The court-appointed lawyer said that since 2015, the state and central governments have done nothing to curb pollution
 sivaay meetings ko karne ke, monitering kii gai he, lekin ection kuch bhi nahin hua he, bacchon kaa saans lenaa mushkil ho rahaa he
 The court said that the biggest reason for pollution is construction, and the dust blowing from it, what has been done for it so far, the court said that air quality can be fixed, tell them, people do not get out of the house Are finding, children are not able to go to school, how can the situation be corrected now, they should solve it
 hoicourt ne kaha ki philhal crop burning ko turant rokane kii jarurat he
 Crop burning is making the situation worse than it was in the situation that has been worsened by the stagnant air
 iske saath hi court ne dilli or aasapaas ke rajyon ko halafanama dene ko kaha ki wo crop burning ko lekar kya-kya kar rahe hai
 This was the reason that caused pollution to increase in Delhi
 Earlier, on September 22, the High Court had ordered that crop from farmers to stop crop burning in UP, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, to curb pollution in Delhi and surrounding states
 The portion of which they burn in the field, the paper industry and the board industry are purchased from the farmers
 isse ek taraf kisaanon ko aarthik madad milegi or duusari taraf fasalon ke avshesh ko jalaane se hone valepradooshanpar bhi lagaam lagegi
 But the state government has not been able to do anything on this yet

 This order was given by the High Court in view of the pollution caused by burning of crop residues in delhi-ncr, but neither the state government nor the central government could understand the seriousness of the matter
 court ne kaha ki compinyon kii yahsaamaajik jimmedaaribanti he
 The court directed the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to take a report every week from a special committee set up in each state to prevent the burning of crop residues
 rajya sarkaron or centre sarkaar ko satellite ke madhyam se paraali jalaane par najar rakhane ko kaha gaya tha, lekin uskaa bhi paalan nahin ho paaya
 The court said that every week the state governments were asked to submit their action report to prevent the burning of crop residues in the court
 1 oktober se yah kaam shuru ho janaa chahie tha
 The court also emphasized the need to do more work on this subject, especially in Punjab and Haryana
 fasalon ke avshesh jalaane vaale logon par mukadmaa darj karne va jurmaana lagane jaise niyamon kaa sakhti se paalan nahin hua

 iske liye uttar korea ne america ke jaivik hathiyaaron ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha
 According to the White Paper of the South Korean Department of Defense, North Korea began preparations to use biological agents as weapons in the 1980s

 Before the Pune ODI between India and New Zealand, 'aaj Tak' had revealed Operation 'cricketgate' regarding pitch fixing
 is oparation kaa bada asar hua he
 icc's Anti Corruption Unit will now investigate the case, bcci's Anti Corruption Bureau will also help in this investigation
 ICC kii team jin logon se poochtacha karegi unki list taiyaar kii ja chuki he
 After the disclosure, the ICC will re-state the rules of anti-corruption to all pitch curators
 aapako bataa den ki pune vanade se thik pehle 'aaj tak' ke camere main pune ke pich curator pandurang salgamvakar ne pich kii taiyaari ko lekar gopneey jaankaree camere ke saamne ujagar kii thi
 Please tell that on Wednesday, the match was played between India and New Zealand in Pune
 haalanki khulaase ke baad hi curator ko match se hataa diya gaya tha or bisisiai kaa curator match ko cover karne ke liye aayaa tha
 What did the pitch curator say on camera? The reporter asked the pitch curator for some changes to the pitch for his two players, to which Pandurang agreed
 pich curator ne kaha ki jo pich hamane taiyaar kii he, usapar 337 ranon tak kaa score ho saktaa he
 Which can be easily chased
 under cover reporter ke kehane par pich curator pandurang use pich dikhaane ko bhi raji ho gaye, jabaki niyam ke anusaar pich par captain or coach ke alaava match se pehle koi nahin ja saktaa he
 At the same time, the pitch curator said that he can change the mood of the pitch within a few minutes
 unhone pich par keel vaale juute pahanakar jane kii bhi ijaajat di
 The BCCI had also said that after speaking of Aaj Tak only after the lapse of strict action, BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Chaudhary said that no convict will be spared

 tej growth ke liye jaruri hai sanrachanaatmak badlamb bhi sarvice sector main ha rahi zyada inakmakheti jaise mul udhyam par phir se focus karnaa hogub bhi sabase zyada rojgaar krishi or sambandhit kshetra mensarkari mahakamon main bhale hi is baat ko lekar bahes chal rahi ho ki bharat kii maujuuda aarthik susti sanrachanaatmak he yaa chakree, lekin yah sach he ki arthvyavastha ko do ankon kii tej raftaar deni he to sanrachanaatmak badlaavon ke vyapak kaam ko aage badhaane kii jarurat he
 The goal of a double-digit economy has been the subject of heated discussion until recent years, but has now been forgotten
 endie sarkaar kii pehali pari main hui thi shuruyatendie sarkaar kii pehali pari kii shuruyaat main sarkaar ke aarthik niti dastavej (iconomic survey) main iske liye spasht khaakaa khinchaa gaya tha
 Structural changes were proposed in this, including significantly advancing the 'make in India' program, employing additional and unskilled workers in sectors such as low productive agriculture, and sufficiently skilled workers in the manufacturing and service sectors with high productivity and high growth potential
 To provide include promoting the 'skill India' program
 modi sarkaar ke donon mahatvakankshi kaarykram ladkadaa rahe hai or kaaphi samay se inaki charchaa nahin ho rahi he, aise main sanrachanaatmak badlaavon par jaahir he kam hi dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 In the first Economic Survey (2018-19) of Modi government's second term, it was accepted that 'investment and especially private investment' is being considered as the 'main carrier' to increase demand, productivity, employment etc
 haalanki, isamen bhi do ankon kii growth rate kii koi baat nahin kahi gai he
 The recent policy initiatives taken to revitalize the economy - corporate tax cuts, capitalization of banks, write-off of npas, write off, FPI and removal of surcharges on super rich - they are also clearly Have been made under the new thinking of accelerating private investment
 haalanki, is baat par nae sire se gaur karnaa jaruri he ki arthvyavastha ke teen mahatvapurn sector- krishi, menuphaccharing or sevaayen kis disha main ja rahe hai, aaj kii do badi chintaaon aamadani or rojgaar main inke yogadan or inke badhat ke lihaaj se
 If we look at their figures from the year 1950-51, their comparative importance is revealed
 zyada se zyada aamadani ab bhi sevaaon ke dwaraazadee ke baad ke zyaadaatar varshon main aamadani srijan ke maamle main sarvice sector yani seva kshetra kaa yogadan sabase zyada rahaa he, jiskaa maapan jidipi growth main yogadan ke hisaab se kiya jaataa he
 Data from the Reserve Bank (base year 2004-05, constant price) show that in the year 1950-51, when India was primarily an agrarian economy and most of its income came from agriculture (52% of GDP), the service sector still The contribution to national income was up to 35 per cent
 badhane laga sarvice sector kaa yogadandusri taraf, menuphaccharing kaa yogadan bahut hi kharaab mahaj 9 fisadi hi tha
 From the year 1980-81 onwards, the contribution of agriculture sector in national income started falling rapidly and the contribution of service sector started increasing rapidly
 nae siries (aadhaar varsh 2011-12 ) se ek saal pehle 2010-11 main rashtriya aay main sarvice sector kaa yogadan kaaphi badhkar 67 fisadi tak pahunch gaya
 Manufacturing's share in national income this year 16
 1 fisadi or krishi kaa yogadan 14
 Was 1 percent
 is tarah 1990 ke dashak main rashtriya aay main yogadan ke lihaaj se menuphaccharing yani vinirmaan ne krishi ko peeche chhod diya
 This situation did not change even in the new series (base year 2011-12, constant price)
 saal 2018-19 main sarvice sector kaa yogadan 71
 7 per cent, while manufacturing contributed 18
 8 fisadi tha
 Contribution of entire industries 21
 8 fisadi tha
 This happened despite the fact that much changes were made in the 2011–12 series, the contribution of manufacturing and the entire industry was increased and the contribution of services was reduced
 donon siries (2004-05 se 2013-14 ke bich) ke aankadon ke tulanaatmak adhyayan se isko samajha ja saktaa he
 For example, in the year 2013-14, the service sector contributed 86 of the old series
 7 fisadi ke mukaable nae siries main ghatakar 67
 Reduced to 7 percent
 isi tarah menuphaccharing kaa yogadan mines 2
 4 percent (-2
 4) se badhkar 14
 Reached 3 percent
 anya varshon ke liye bhi halaat kuch aise hi rahe
 Employment remains the backbone of agriculture; Despite the employment being so important, no government has presented its time series data
 pehle yojana ayog ne kai saal tak rojgaar ke tulanaatmak aankade pesh kiye the or antarrashtriya shram sanghathan (ILO) vitt varsh 2000 se aisi suchanaaen uplabdh kara rahaa he
 Estimates for 1950–51, 1955–56 and 1959–60 using data from the Central Statistical Organization are presented in the December 3, 1966 issue of Economic and Political Weekly
 in data sroton kaa istemaal karte hue 1950-51 ke baad rojgaar ke maamle main pramukh sector kii haalat is prakaar he
 As the above graph shows, agriculture and allied activities have been providing the maximum employment since 1950-51
 haalanki, yah aankada saal 1950-51 ke 72
 Decreased from 4% to 43 in 2018-19
 9 fisadi rah gaya he
 The service sector continues to be at the second position and it showed growth in 2018-19
 menuphaccharing sector main saal 1950-51 main 8
 8 per cent got jobs and its share increased to 11 in 2018
 6 fisadi tak pahunch gaya
 With automation, manufacturing is increasingly becoming a sector with high capital requirements, due to which jobs are being endangered, in such a case, the potential of this sector in terms of providing employment in future can be viewed with suspicion
 sarvice sector kii badhat raftaar bani hui hejidipi badhat ke hisaab se koi mahatvapurn trend to nahin dikhataa, lekin anya donon sector ke mukaable sarvice sector apni badhat kii gati saal 1951-52 se hi ab tak banaae hue he, jabaki pichhali kuch timahiyon se arthvyavastha susti ke chapet main he
 In the new series the calculations have been changed and the Gross Value Edition (GVA) has been added
 gauratlab he ki jivie main tex ko jodne or usase sabsiedi ghataane par jidipi hasil hota he
 To start with the basics like agriculture, the Economic Survey 2014-15 has considered two things to be important - a
 krishi se menuphaccharing kii taraf bade paimaane par badhane kaa louisian shift- jaisaa ki viksit deshon or kai asian diggajon ne kar dikhaaya he- bi
 After this, the shift towards service sector as done by India and many African countries has achieved high growth rate
 asian vikaas bank (ADB) dwaara kii gai ek study ‘agriculture and strectural transformation in develping asia: rivyuu and outluk' main asian diggajon kii safalataa par kuch or roshni padati he
 It said that the rapid growth of these countries was on the strength of agriculture, due to which the manufacturing sector has also expanded rapidly
 isamen kaha gaya he: ‘purvi asia ke nai audyogikrut arthvyavasthaaon (japan, dakshin korea, china or taipei) ne krishi vikaas ke dam par hone vaali audyogikaran kaa rasta chunaa he
 Economies with fast-growing transitions (eg China, Vietnam) are also seen to follow a similar path
 baaki vikasshil asian deshon jaise indonesia, malaysia or thailand main bhi krishi main vruddhi ek pramukh visheshta rahi he
 However, agricultural development has lagged behind in countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and the Philippines
 in deshon main teji se hone vaala satat vikaas kaaphi der se aayaa he yaa abhi tak nahin ho paaya he
 'in sharp contrast, growth in India and many African economies (eg Tanzania, Ethiopia) is primarily due to the service sector, while the manufacturing sector is not growing
 africa anubhavon par aadhaarit ek study ke mutabik isaki vajah yah he ki technology kii tarakkee or globaligeshan kii vajah se duniya bhar main sevaaon ke utpaadan or vyapaar main vistaar hua he
 Based on the comparative advantages, it is now possible that low-income countries can grow faster, as seen in the case of manufacturing
 iske alaava ye donon ek saajhe shuruyaat kii ore le jate hai: vah he krishi
 The reason for this is that agriculture is the main source of income of about half the poor population in low income countries
 bijepi ne assam main isi saal hone vaale vidhansabha chunaav kii taiyaariyaan tej kar di hai
 The party has tied up with the United People's Front (UPF) for this
 bas iskaa elaan hona baaki he
 The alliance will be announced during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Assam
 vah 19 janvari ko assam jane vaale hai
 The first step towards such an alliance was taken on 5 December, when a meeting was held between Modi and the Bodoland People's Front (BPF) chief Hungrama Mohilary
 dilachasp he ki BPF kii maujuuda vidhansabha main 10 siten hai or 2006 se 2014 tak yah congress ke saath sarkaar kaa hissaa thi
 At the same time, UPF consists of 9 organizations

 " a youth detained at Rajendra Nagar police station in Indore drank acid
 acid pine vaale yuvak ne baad main dam tod diya
 a youth named Pappu Chauhan was accused of molesting a neighbor
 police hiraasat main usne thane ke toilet main rakhaa acid pi liya
 He was brought to the hospital in critical condition, where he succumbed
 haalanki police ise haadasa bataa rahi he
 It is worth mentioning that eight months ago, at this police station, a young man named Ravi succumbed painfully in the brother's lap
 vah chaaku se jakhmi tha
 Pappu Chauhan, who lives in the Diet Complex of Indore, had filed a complaint of molestation by a minor girl living in the neighborhood, on which the wife and father-in-law of the accused brought them to the police station and handed them over to the police

 Recently, the Supreme Court has issued guidelines regarding acid
 yahi vajah he ki indore police is ghatana ko duusari shakl dene kii koshish kar rahi he
 The question arises that how can a person think of acid as water? ladki jor se chillaai, tab vahaan or log aa gaye
 Pappu could not be found when the police arrived, then the people of the locality took Pappu to the police station, where he drank the acid bottle kept in the toilet as water

 Even after not repaying such a large loan amount, he was roaming freely and many private guards were deployed under his protection
 haalanki, bank ke vitt halaat ujagar hone ke baad in donon ko police ne giraftaar kiya
 Both of them took a loan of Rs 6500 crore from PMC Bank
 aarope he ki inhone bank ko lone kii mul raashi tak waapas nahin kii he
 Now both of them have been sent to police custody till 9 October
 sutron se mili jaankaree ke anusaar is company ke maalik ke liye sthiti achaanak hi kharaab ho gai thi
 Explain that the owner of this company has a very good relationship from film stars to politicians
 echdiiel company dwaara bank se liye lone kii raashi na chukaane kii vajah se bank kii haalat itani kharaab ho gai he vah apane khataadharakon ko bhi paise dene kii sthiti main nahin rahaa
 After this, the people holding an account in this bank demanded the intervention of the central government in the whole matter
 aisa bataaya ja rahaa he ki PMC bank ne apane lone kii kul raashi kaa 75 fisadi hissaa yani 4000 karod rupee echdiiel ko hi de diya tha
 Due to this, when the company did not return the loan amount, the bank's condition deteriorated
 echdiiel ke pramotars par aarope he ki unhone bank se zyada se zyada lone lene ke liye 21 hajaar farji khate khulwaaye
 According to sources, even after the company did not return the loan amount taken earlier, the bank continued to loan them
 bank ne apane vaarshik report ne iskaa zikr bhi nahin kiya
 In the investigation so far, it has been clearly revealed that the bank continued to give loan to the company even after the bankrupt

 unhone kaha ki vadhavan lone kaa bhugtan karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Amidst all this, the employees of PMC Bank have also started accusing RBI of cheating them

 'eid ul-azha' is a means of sacrificing the truth and expressing love for God

 This festival inspires the bands to live up to every trial
 jamiya milia islamia ke islamic adhyayan vibhaag ke professor junayd haaris kehete hai, ‘‘id ul-ajaha kaa asal sandesh yahi he ki insaan ko sachaai par qurbaan hone ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 The Quran also gives the message of truth and humanity by quoting
 ’’is tyohaar ko aamtaur par ‘bakreed’ ke naam se janaa jaataa he jisaki taarikh hazrat ibrahim, unki begum haajra or pyaare bete ismail se judi he
 The foundation of this date is that one father agreed to sacrifice his liver (son) to express his love for God
 id ul-ajaha ke maukey par log namaaj adaa karne ke baad jaanwaron kii qurbaani dete hai
 Also donate to the poor and meet their friends and relatives
 pramukh islamic shodh santhaan daarul musanniphin ke up pramukh moulana mohammad umer al siddiq ne lakhanu main bakreed kii ahmiyat ke bare main bataaya ki yah tyohaar ham sabko hazrat ibrahim kii kurabaani kii bhaavana kii yaad dilaataa he
 The date of Bakrid or Qurbani is associated with Hazrat Ibrahim
 islam ke mutabik kareeb chaar hajaar saal pehle makka :ab saudi arab kaa shahar: main hazrat ibrahim kaa khuda ne jindagi main kai baar imtahaan liya
 The first major examination was taken when his son Ismail was in his mother's lap
 us vakt ibrahim khuda ke hukum ko maanate hue registan main apni bivi haajra or maasoom ismail ko chhodkar chale gaye
 At that time, Hajra wandered over the surrounding areas, especially the two hills al-safa and al-marwa, to quench his son's thirst, but there was not a single drop of water
 kaha jaataa he ki maa kii tadap or maasoom ismail kii pyaas ko dekhte hue khuda ne registan se ‘jamajam’ ko ijaat kar diya
 Today this water is the most culinary for Muslims around the world
 ye donon pahadiyaan bhi haj ke safar par jane waalon ke liye khaasi ahm hai
 According to the Islamic date, Khuda took another test of Hazrat Ibrahim at a time when Ismail had grown a bit
 is baar khud kaa hukum tha ki hazrat ibrahim duniya main apni sabase pyaari cheez ko khuda kii raah main qurbaan kar den
 Hazrat was no more dear to Abraham than his son Ismail and he agreed to sacrifice his son, obeying God's command
 professor haaris kehete hai, ‘‘quran ke mutabik ibrahim ne ismail se kaha ki allaah kaa hukum hua he ki main tumhe qurbaan kar duun
 Ismail replied that when God commands, i too am ready to sacrifice
 baad main ismail kii jagah ek jaanavar aa gaya
 God was just taking the examination of Hazrat Abraham
