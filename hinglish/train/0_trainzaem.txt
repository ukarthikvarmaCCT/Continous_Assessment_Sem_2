 cricket ke itihaas kaa ek or kaala din jab spot phixing ke iljaam main teen cricketer salaakhon ke peeche chale gaye
 But, the investigation of the police is no less surprising than the sensational disclosure of spot-fixing in the IPL
 dilli police ne kaise kholaa spot phixing scandle? kaise giraft main aae srisanth, chandila or chavaan?dilli police ne ipel main spot phixing ke jis sansanikhej scandle kaa khulaasa kiya he, uski shuruyaat ipel sijan sicks shuru hone ke kaaphi pehle ho gai thi
 Actually, Delhi Police had received information that Mumbai's underworld is involved in match fixing
 dilli police ne is soochna par kaam shuru kiya or sandigdh fiksaron ke phone ko servilans par laga diya
 During the surveillance, an important name surfaced of Biju
 lekin baad main police ne paaya ki biju to buki kaa nakli naam he
 The real name is Jiju Janardhan who used to play from the Ernakulam club in Kerala
 isi club se srisanth bhi khelte hai
 The police later found out that Sreesanth and Jiju also have a close friendship
 dosti kaa yahi conection srisanth ko spot phixing main ghaseet laayaa
 The Delhi Police was constantly monitoring the activities of Jiju and suspected bookies
 dilli police ke mutabik bookiyon ko un khilaadiyon kii talash thi jo bikne ke liye taiyaar hon
 Three players also agreed to this
 srisanth, ajit chandila or ankit chavaan
 Now the challenge before Delhi Police was to catch these players red handed
 ye kaam aasaan nahin tha
 Therefore, the team of Delhi Police started reaching the stadium to watch every match
 iskaa ek khaas makasad tha
 Delhi Police's efforts paid off and 11 bookies including three cricketers were killed
 - police ke mutabik ab tak is baat ke saboot nahin hai ki kisi team kaa maalik isamen shaamil he
 - However, the police suspect that other teams may have such fixers
 - police ne is cese main or giraftaar kii sambhaavnaaon ko bhi khaarij nahin kiya
 - The link of Mumbai underworld has been revealed in spot fixing but the wires of Dawood Ibrahim or Tiger Memon could not be proved
 ye dilli police hi thi jisane pehali baar cricket main match phixing kaa bhandaphod kiya tha
 This time also the Delhi Police has revealed the spot fixing

 ’’ Within next one or one and a half months, Board of Control for Cricket in India will announce the names of players to be included in all three grades (A, B, C) for the year 2017-18
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki is baar khilaadiyon ko board baari-bharkam salanaa selary dene ja rahaa he
 a few days ago on this issue, captain Virat Kohli met coach Vinod Rai, chairman of the administrative committee, along with coach Ravi Shastri and Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 sutron kii maane, to board khilaadiyon kii maang ko maan gaya he
 Despite this, a very serious question is arising
 baharhaal, board khilaadiyon ke vetan main kitna bhi ijapha kyon na karen, lekin sach yah he ki ve apane 'vaastavik or haq ke vetan' se milon dur hai
 If the board actually pays the players according to the terms of its constitution, then the annual salary of each player in a grade is easily at least twenty five crore rupees
 bataa den ki bisisiai apanesanvidhan ke anusaar kul salanaa rajasav kaa 70 fisadi hissaa gharelu rajya ikaayiyon or iskaa 26 fisadi hissaa khilaadiyon ko detaa he
 Out of this 26, 13 per cent of international cricketers and 10
 6 hissaa gharelu cricketron ko chalaa jaataa he
 Also read: Virat Kohli took 'some such' revenge for Mathews' 'gham Special'! vahiin bachaa kareeb 2
 4% of revenue is paid to junior cricketers and women players
 isi tees main se shesh chaar fisadi rajasav stadimon ke nirmaan, rakh-rakhaav or prashaskeey kharchon main chalaa jaataa he
 The formula was approved by former BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya in 2004 after talks with former cricketers Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid
 lekin saal 2008 main ipel shuru hone ke baad khilaadiyon kii maangon ke saath-saath tevar bhi badal gaye
 At the same time, after the four years of IPL broadcast rights sold for about 16,000 crore rupees, the thinking of the players has gradually become more aggressive and vocal
 lekin board purv main selary ko lekar 'apana hi khel' kheltaa rahaa he
 Explain that the annual salary paid to the players is given out of the second part of the total revenue 30 percent (the first part is 70 percent), not the board's total, or 100 percent of the revenue
 vahiin, sabase ahm baat yah he ki board is 26 fisadi rajasav main bhi team india ke international maichon ke media, yaa prasaaran adhikaron (tivi, internet or mobile) se hasil hone vaali kamai ko shaamil nahin karata
 Whereas the board earns the most from broadcasting rights
 aise main ipel ke prasaaran adhikaron kii bikri se mili paise ko khilaadiyon ko die jane vaale hisse main shaamil karne kii baat hi swapnsrikhee lagati he
 Also read: That's why Virat Kohli is afraid of playing 'anything' with Pujara! vahiin, khilaadiyon ko praayojan adhikaar or isisi pratiyogitaaon se mili rakam main se bhi bahut hi maamuli hissaa miltaa he
 But now, Virat & Co
 wants the players to get a share from the board's huge revenue from broadcasting rights
 matlab bhartiya team ke prasaaran adhikaar or ipel donon ke hi prasargadhikaar se
 Please note that Star Sports has the rights to broadcast both the International Match and IPL of Team India
 bhartiya team ke maichon ke july 2012 se march 2018 tak media adhikaar (tivi, internet or mobile) ke liye star sports ne kareeb 37,00 karod rupee chukaaye the
 This brings an average of Rs 40 crore for an international match to the BCCI
 iskaa matlab yah he ki har saal sirf team india ke prasaaran adhikaar se hi bisisiai ko kareeb sava chah sau karod The money comes
 is rakam kaa 26 fisadi kareeb 160 karod rupee baithta he
 The amount spent on international players kiye jane vaala 13 fisadi yani assi karod rupee baithta he
 Now think for yourself that if this international players get only 80 crores rupees annually, then how much amount will come in the share of each player
 vahiin, aap andaja laga sakate hai ki jab bisisiai inhen prasaaran adhikaron kaa hissaa khilaadiyon ke saath nahin baant rahaa, to vah ipel ke prasaaran adhikaron se mili baari bharkam 16,000 karod rupee kii rakam ko khilaadiyon ke saath saajha karne kaa bada dil kaise dikhayega
 You see that 26 per cent of 16000 crores is 4160 crores
 tippaniyan Also read: Virat Kohli throws record 'power' on second day bisisiai samvidhan ke anusaar khilaadiyon ke haq kii is rakam ko salanaa aamadani main tabdeel kii jaae, to yah kareeb 832 karod (international+gharelu cricketer ke liye) rupee baithti he
 This amount means that 13% of this annual 26% means that the amount spent on Team India players becomes Rs 416 crore
 sochie ki agar ye 416 karod rupee bhartiya team ke teenon gradon main shaamil khilaadiyon ko baante jaaen, to grad e main shaamil sheersh aath yaa das khilaadiyon main se prayek ke hisse main kam se kam 20 karod rupee to aaenge hi! board ke 'vaastavik samvidhan' ke anusaar is par unka puraa-puraa haq bhi banataa he! vahiin, agar isamen team india ke prasaaran adhikaar or saal main khele jane vaale maichon (prati test-15 lakh, vanade-6 lakh, tii-20-3 lakh rupee) kii fees ko ko is rakam main shaamil kar liya jaae, to yah salanaa fees kam se kam 25 karod rupee ho jaati he

 com / ndmmtzbs4w — BCCI (@BCCI) December 3, 2017 In a way, this amount according to the BCCI constitution (26 per cent) (broadcast rights to the players' share shaamil karne par, jo ki nahin hai) hi banati he, lekin board ke adhikari hi is baat kaa jawaab de sakate hai ki kyon Why has the 'special rule' been excluded from the 26 per cent of the amount received only from broadcasting rights? baharhaal, board khilaadiyon ke vetan main kitna bhi ijapha kyon na karen, lekin sach yah he ki ve apane 'vaastavik or haq ke vetan' se milon dur hai

 The formula was approved by former BCCI President Jagmohan Dalmiya in 2004 after talks with former cricketers Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid
 lekin saal 2008 main ipel shuru hone ke baad khilaadiyon kii maangon ke saath-saath tevar bhi badal gaye
 At the same time, after the four years of IPL broadcast rights sold for about 16,000 crore rupees, the thinking of the players has gradually become more aggressive and vocal
 lekin board purv main selary ko lekar 'apana hi khel' kheltaa rahaa he
 Explain that the annual salary paid to the players is given out of the second part of the total revenue 30 percent (the first part is 70 percent), not the board's total, or 100 percent of the revenue
 vahiin, sabase ahm baat yah he ki board is 26 fisadi rajasav main bhi team india ke international maichon ke media, yaa prasaaran adhikaron (tivi, internet or mobile) se hasil hone vaali kamai ko shaamil nahin karata
 Whereas the board earns the most from broadcasting rights
 aise main ipel ke prasaaran adhikaron kii bikri se mili paise ko khilaadiyon ko die jane vaale hisse main shaamil karne kii baat hi swapnsrikhee lagati he
 Also read: That's why Virat Kohli is afraid of playing 'anything' with Pujara! vahiin, khilaadiyon ko praayojan adhikaar or isisi pratiyogitaaon se mili rakam main se bhi bahut hi maamuli hissaa miltaa he
 But now, Virat & Co
 wants the players to get a share from the board's huge revenue from broadcasting rights
 matlab bhartiya team ke prasaaran adhikaar or ipel donon ke hi prasargadhikaar se
 Please note that Star Sports has the rights to broadcast both the International Match and IPL of Team India
 bhartiya team ke maichon ke july 2012 se march 2018 tak media adhikaar (tivi, internet or mobile) ke liye star sports ne kareeb 37,00 karod rupee chukaaye the
 This brings an average of Rs 40 crore for an international match to the BCCI
 iskaa matlab yah he ki har saal sirf team india ke prasaaran adhikaar se hi bisisiai ko kareeb sava chah sau karod The money comes
 is rakam kaa 26 fisadi kareeb 160 karod rupee baithta he
 The amount spent on international players kiye jane vaala 13 fisadi yani assi karod rupee baithta he
 Now think for yourself that if this international players get only 80 crores rupees annually, then how much amount will come in the share of each player
 vahiin, aap andaja laga sakate hai ki jab bisisiai inhen prasaaran adhikaron kaa hissaa khilaadiyon ke saath nahin baant rahaa, to vah ipel ke prasaaran adhikaron se mili baari bharkam 16,000 karod rupee kii rakam ko khilaadiyon ke saath saajha karne kaa bada dil kaise dikhayega
 You see that 26 per cent of 16000 crores is 4160 crores
 tippaniyan Also read: Virat Kohli throws record 'power' on second day bisisiai samvidhan ke anusaar khilaadiyon ke haq kii is rakam ko salanaa aamadani main tabdeel kii jaae, to yah kareeb 832 karod (international+gharelu cricketer ke liye) rupee baithti he
 This amount means that 13% of this annual 26% means that the amount spent on Team India players becomes Rs 416 crore
 sochie ki agar ye 416 karod rupee bhartiya team ke teenon gradon main shaamil khilaadiyon ko baante jaaen, to grad e main shaamil sheersh aath yaa das khilaadiyon main se prayek ke hisse main kam se kam 20 karod rupee to aaenge hi! board ke 'vaastavik samvidhan' ke anusaar is par unka puraa-puraa haq bhi banataa he! vahiin, agar isamen team india ke prasaaran adhikaar or saal main khele jane vaale maichon (prati test-15 lakh, vanade-6 lakh, tii-20-3 lakh rupee) kii fees ko ko is rakam main shaamil kar liya jaae, to yah salanaa fees kam se kam 25 karod rupee ho jaati he

 When Vaghela was asked that he was being called the bjp's b team, which is in the fray to defeat the Congress, Vaghela's answer was whether Kejriwal formed the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi to defeat the Congress

 Who are Yehonahar: There are four students who created this history, namely, Kukumoni Todu, Saheb Madi, Mangal Murmu, Kukomoni
 in chaar honhaaron main 2 ladkiyaan bhi hai
 Please tell that 40 families live in this village, who have settled here for the last 150 years and their livelihood is farming

 Reason for delay in achieving success: Until many years ago, the children of this village had the option of going to primary school, which was three km away
 bachche skool main admician lete lekin jald hi padhai bich main chhod dete the
 The reason for this was that farmers were not able to leave their children every day

 ZTE china kii ek company he isamen do phul sies screen vaala smartphone pesh kiya he jo apane aap main kaaphi anokhaa he
 In this smartphone, the Do's are connected to each other through the display hinge
 khaas baat ye he ki ye donon milakar ek saath kaam kar sakate hai
 But if you want, you can also use both of them separately
 hinj se alag karke nahin balki saath main hi

 So that the atmosphere can be returned in favor of BJP and return to power

 Interestingly, in the address of Amit Shah, the work done by the state government is less mentioned and more about the functioning of the Modi government
 haal main jaipur main prabud naagarik sammelan main shah ne enarasi, sargical strike, kisaanon, garibon, mahilaon ke liye modi sarkaar dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon par zyada jor diya
 The strategy behind this is to create an atmosphere in favor of the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections by reducing the anti-incumbency against the state government
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah 11 sitambar ko jaipur aae thea
 Shah had asked the representatives of the cooperative institutions to print the booklet of the work done in favor of the farmers by the central and state government and distribute it to the farmers
 sahakaari sansthaaen kisaanon ke bich kaam karti hai
 If the representatives of the cooperative institutions promote the functioning of the government, then BJP will get its benefit in the upcoming elections
 iske baad shah ne prabud nagarikon ko sambodhit kiya yahaan bhi unke bhaashan kaa labbo-lubaab centre sarkaar kii uplabdhiyaan ginate hue loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ko target kiya gaya

 The story of an conspiracy whose ends were spread across three cities of UP
 ek shahar main ek aurat or uske bete kii gumshudagi kii report to do alag-alag shaharon main police ko do buree tarah se jali hui laashen milti he
 The police of the three cities, in their own way, start investigating these three different cases
 lekin us vakt use bhi is baat kaa ilm nahin hota ki teen shaharon main bikhri ye tamaam kadiyaan ek rose aapas main milane vaali hai
 On 12 January 2014, the police find the dead body of a girl near a cold storage in up's city Sambhal
 laash buree tarah jali hui thi jise dekh kar maranevaali kii shinaakht kar paanaa bhi naammumkin ho rahaa tha
 In such a situation, the police retrieve the corpse and send it for postmortem and start finding out about some of the girls who have disappeared from the surrounding area
 lekin kaafii koshish ke baavjood use aisa koi bhi nahin miltaa, jo laash ko pahchaanane kaa daawa kar sake
 Already, the Aligarh police found the body of a young man in his area on the spot just a hundred kilometers from Sambhal and it was burnt like a dead body
 zaahir he, sanbhal main hue qatl kii tarah hi is maamle main qaatil ne noujvaan kii jaan lene ke baad uski pahchaan chhipaane ke liye laash ko jala diya tha
 And just like the stable police, the Aligarh police gets tired of making all efforts to identify this corpse
 baad main police postmortem ke baad in donon laashon ko laavaaris maan kar unka antim sanskaar kar diya
 On the other hand, two people from Ghaziabad, just 107 kilometers away from both these cities, disappeared in a very mysterious way on the first day ie on January 11
 iname ek he 37 saal kii mahila benazir, jabaki doosraa uskaa 17 saal kaa betaa salmaan
 Shocked by the disappearance of both, Benazir and Salman's family are searching for them badly
 kabhi rishtedaaron ke yahaan, kabhi aspataalon main to kabhi police thane main
 But this effort of the householders is of no particular benefit
 pehle to police benazir or salmaan ke gharavaalon ko unke apane-aap waapas laut aane kii baat kah kar taalane kii koshish karti he, lekin jab gharavaale donon kii gumshudagi ko kisi saazish kaa nateeja bataa kar unke dushmano ke naam ginate hai, to jaise police bhi neend se jaag uthati he
 Three days later, a missing case is registered and the investigation is started
 darasal benazir ghaziabad ke islam nagar main apane bacchon ke saath akeli rahati thi
 She had been separated from her husband Abid Ali many years ago, but the situation in which she went missing with her son Salman on January 11 was no less an enigma to all the people around
 ghaziabad main benazir or salmaan ke tamaam rishtedaar donon ke gaayab hone ke baad se hi sakate main the
 Initially, the police had taken lightly the disappearance of the two, but when Benazir's relatives took the name of Wasim, a young man who was nearby as his enemy, the police ears were also raised and then the police told about Wasim
 Began to find out
 ye vahi wasim tha, jo benazir ke shuhar aabid ali ke alag hone ke baad benazir ke qareeb aa chukaa tha
 In other words, Wasim and Benazir used to love each other immensely
 lekin ajeeb baat ye thi ki ab benazir ke gharavaale is wasim ko benazir or uske bete kii gumshudagi ke liye zimmedaar bataa rahe the
 On the other hand, the police were not knowing anything about Wasim despite passing through many days
 darasal, wasim or uske kuch dost in donon kii gumshudagi kii khabar aam hone ke saath hi ghaziabad se baahar ja chuke the
 In such a situation, the suspicion of the police became even deeper on Wasim
 ab benazir or wasim ke maut kii baat takreeban saafe ho chuki thi
 It was clear that both had been killed
 isi bich ghaziabad police ko ye bhi pataa chal gaya ki sanbhal or aligarh main donon kii gumshudagi kii thik baad do laavaaris laashen mili thim, jo buree tarah jali hui thi or antim sanskaar se pehle donon kii pahchaan bhi nahin ho saki thi
 But by linking these two ends of a double murder, it was important for the police to reach the most important character of the plot, that is, Wasim to find out the whole story
 udhar, wasim apane peeche police padi hone kii bhanak paakar pehle hi apane doston ke saath ghaziabad se dur ja chukaa tha
 The police put the mobile phones of Wasim and his friends on surveillance and by coincidence his tricks worked
 ghaziabad police ko unke lokation kaa pataa chal gaya or jald hi wasim or uskaa gang salaakhon ke peeche tha
 But after this, these accused got shocked by hearing the story of Benazir and Salman to the police
 poochtacha ke dauraan wasim ne pehle to police ko uljhane kii koshish kii, lekin jald hi uske sawaalon ke saamne wasim ne hathiyaar daal die
 He started sprouting the truth
 ab wasim bol rahaa tha or police sun rahi thi
 It was a tale of a murderer of a mother-son
 jisamen wasim samet kul paanch log shaamil the
 How the plot was hatched on 11 January 2011 at Shastri Nagar, Delhi, at 11 am this morning, on the mobile phone of Benazir, one of his old friends Shabnam got a call
 vahi shabnam, benazir jiske saath kabhi beauty parlor main kaam kiya karti thi
 The two were firm friends, and Shabnam from Ittefaq was also the mouthful sister of Wasim, Benazir's boyfriend
 lekin jab benazir ko uski azeez saheli ne phone par shastrinagar main ek nae beauty parlor ke udghaatan ke liye daavat di, to benazir ko dur-dur tak apni saheli par koi shaq nahin hua or wo foran taiyaar ho gai or apane bete salmaan ke saath shabnam kii daavat main shaamil hone ghar se nikal gai
 But this was one such mistake of Benazir, which brought them both to death
 beauty parlor ke udghaatan ke bahaane shabnam ne apni saheli benazir or salmaan ko aisi cold drink pilaai ki donon behosh ho gaye
 Intoxication was found in this cold drink
 apane bhai wasim ke saath saazish main shaamil shabnam apane iraade main kaamayaab ho chuki thi
 The murderer rushed into Mahendra Enclave's house with unconscious Benazir and Salman and then strangled and took the mother-son's life
 wasim or uske saathiyon ne laashon ko kapade main lapeta or unhen thikaane lagane baahar nikal pade
 He first arrived in Sambhal and threw Benazir's corpse to a deserted place near a cold storage on Gawan Road and set it on fire
 makasad tha, laash ke chehre ko is kadar bigaadna kii pahchaan naammumkin ho or qatl hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye police ke liye paheli ban kar rah jaaen
 After locating the body of Benazir, the killer went straight to Aligarh from Sambhal to find Salman's body and at Atrauli Road, he treated Salman's body with the same as his mother's body
 iske baad qaatil is raaj ke hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye dafn ho jane kaa bharam paal chuke the lekin chand rose main kuch aisa hua ki sara bhanda foot gaya

 The Supreme Court has said that an ordinary citizen does not have a voice
 wo apni maang ke liye kai saalon tak boat club yaa jantar mantar par dharna de lekin koi nahin sunata jabaki ek raajnneetik party ke paas ek platform hota he
 Through this, she can gather and picket hundreds of people anywhere with her demands
 vidhansabha yaa sansad main apane pratinidhiyon ke jariye apni aawaaj uthaa sakati he
 In such a situation, the court cannot allow political parties to file a PIL in any case
 agar supreme court ne raajnneetik partiyon ko janhit yachika daakhil karne kii ijaajat di to hoicourt or supreme court main janhit nahin balki nijee hit vaale maamalon kii bharmaar ho jaaegi
 In any case, it will be difficult to clear which demand is of public interest and which is of personal interest
 kal ko koi party ye kehete hue court aa jaaegi ki hamaari baat sansad main nahin suni ja rahi, court hamaari baat sune
 On behalf of Swaraj Abhiyan, Prashant Bhushan said that the Supreme Court should be allowed to file a petition to political parties in the matter of public interest, if the court feels that the petition has political interest, not public interest, then it can be dismissed

 aise main court raajnneetik partiyon ko ye ijaajat nahin de saktaa ki wo kisi bhi maamle main janhit yachika daakhil kare
 If the Supreme Court allows political parties to file public interest litigation, then there will be a plethora of cases of private interest and not in the High Court and the Supreme Court
 kisi bhi maamle main ye saaf karnaa mushkil hoga ki koun si maang janhit kii he or koun si nijee hit kii
 Tomorrow, a party will come to the court saying that we are not being heard in Parliament, the court should listen to us

 com / stmb9yz5uf chhattisgarh kii raman singh sarkaar ne agava kiye gaye sukama ke dm elex paul menon kii rihaai ko lekar naksaliyon se baatcheet karne ke liye nirmala buch or esake mishra ko madhyasth tay kiya he
 Chief Minister Raman Singh himself announced their names, and both these officers have taken complete information about their illness and medicines from the family of the collector
 darasal, naksaliyon ne apni taraf se madhyasthata ke liye jo teen naam sujhaaye the, unamem se do - prashanth bhushan or manish kunjam - ne madhyasthata se inkaar kar diya he, jabaki bidi sharma rihaai par donon pakshon ke saath baatcheet ke liye taiyaar hai
 Earlier, there was news of the health of Sukma's abducted district collector, and the government had arranged for the dispatch of drugs through Manish Kunjam, the national president of the tribal Mahasabha, selected by the Maoists to act as an intermediary
 kunjam ne haalanki madhyasthata karne se inkaar kar diya tha, lekin vah biimaar jiladhish ke liye dawaaen lekar jane ko taiyaar ho gaye the
 Kunjam said that the state government asked him to take medicines in view of the poor health of District Collector Alex Paul Menon, for which he agreed
 kunjam ne kaha tha ki vah madhyasthata se inkaar kar chuke hai, lekin menon kii bigadati tabiyat ko dekhte hue maanviya aadhaar par dawaaen lekar jane ko taiyaar the
 He had said that he would soon go to Sukma and get his medicines from the District Magistrate's residence, and then go to Tadmetla village, where the Maoists have asked the intermediaries to come
 isse pehle sarvadaleey baithak main mukhyamantri raman singh kii baatcheet kii peshkash ke baad naksaliyon ne madhyasthon ke naam sujhaaye the
 Naxalites suggested names of famous lawyer Prashant Bhushan, former CPI MLA from Konta Manish Kunjam and former Bastar collector BD Sharma
 tippaniyan Meanwhile, many questions are also arising in Sukma's DM kidnapping case
 surakshabalon or prashasan ke bich talmail kii kami kii baat bhi kahi ja rahi he
 Actually, it is also being opened here that Menon usually used to go to these areas, ignoring the SOP i
e
 security rules
 us din bhi vah aise hi manjhipada pahunch gaye the
 However, the government argues that officers have to reach the people in a similar way
 yah sach he ki pichley kuch dinon main jin kuch netaaon or afasaron par naksaliyon ne hamalaa bolaa he, ve bandook kii jagah vikaas kii baat karte rahe hai
 Officers like Vinil Krishna or Rajat Kumar or leaders like Jhina Hikka have all talked about development by connecting with people
 kahin na kahin surakshabalon ko ehsaas he ki afasaron ke ravaiye se unki mushkilen badhati he, kyonki jin khoonkhaar naksaliyon ko ve badi mushkil se pakadte hai, ve is tarah aasaani se chhot jate hai

 Kunjam had said that he had refused to mediate, but was willing to take medicines on humanitarian grounds given Menon's deteriorating health
 unhone kaha tha ki vah jald hi sukama jaakar jiladhish ke awaas se unki dawaaen lenge, or phir tarmetala gaanv tak jaaenge, jahaan maovadiyon ne madhyasthon se aane ke liye kaha he
 Earlier, Naxalites suggested the names of the arbitrators after the Chief Minister Raman Singh offered talks in an all-party meeting
 naksaliyon kii ore se mashhoor vakil prashanth bhushan, konta se sipiai ke purv vidhayak manish kunjam or bastar ke purv colector bidi sharma ke naam sujhaaye gaye the
 The comments is bich, sukama ke dm ke apharan ke maamle main ab kai sawaal bhi uth rahe hai
 There is also talk of lack of coordination between the security forces and the administration
 darasal yahaan yah baat bhi khul rahi he ki menon aamtaur par esaopi yani suraksha ke kaayadon kii andekhi kar in ilaakon main jate the
 That day too, he reached Manjipada like that
 haalanki sarkaar kaa tark he ki afasaron ko isi tarah logon tak pahunchnaa hoga
 It is true that in the last few days, some leaders and officers who have been attacked by Naxalites have been talking about development instead of guns

 To know this reality, Aaj Tak did a reality check of the police of all the cities of UP

 After the horrific incident of Bulandshahr, when the team till date turned their camera in different cities of UP and did a reality check of the police, astonishing pictures came out
 ek taraf to upi police or sarkaar bulandshahr kii vaardaat ke baad chaukas ho jane kii baat kah rahe the to duusari taraf jamini hakeekat kuch or hi nikali
 Policemen were found sleeping in Bulandshahr

 When the camera of Aaj Tak's team turned towards the Chief Minister's home district of Etawah, the policemen were snoring in a comfortable chair
 yahi haal bijanour or elahabaad jile kaa bhi tha
 The reality of the police in Gorakhpur or Bareilly or Allahabad, however, seemed to defy the claims of the government
 isse saaf pataa chal rahaa tha ki ek khaufnak vaardaat ke baad upi police kitni mustaid hui

 tajjub kii baat he ki ek aaropee ko yun bithakar wo pulisavaala maze se kharrate le rahaa tha
 In spite of our team's interaction with this person, he will not get lice on his ear
 hamaari team daroga ji or aaropee ko yun hi chhodkar chaowkee ke thik saamne haive par jayja lene pahunchi
 There was barricades, but no policemen
 ye shahar main entry kii ahm police chaowkee thi
 The most important road post to enter in the same Bulandshahr, the Bulandshahr in which the gangrape incident shook even the head of the state government and the police
 lekin is chaowkee ke pulisavaale harakat main nahin aa paae
 Similar circumstances were also there at the Secunderabad Khurja post in the district
 baahar se dekhte hi khurja kii chaowkee sannaate main dubi nazar ai
 No policeman from the gate to the inside

 Inside the outpost, there was a silence like a burgh
 yahaan koi insaan bhi he iskaa iklauta saboot mila ek barrack main
 But the policeman present there was also snoring, not prompt
 jab chaukiyon main pulisavaale hi nahin
 So to whom is the complaint made iske baad hamaari team ne police ke emergency number 100 ko dial kiya
 Repeatedly dialed

 Vasundhara, who had submitted an affidavit for Lalit Modi in the UK to assist in immigration, had said that Modi was targeted because of political envy in India
 bataa den ki 2011 main, vasundhara ne us halafname par dastakhat kiye the

 It is noteworthy that after the Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has been accused of helping cricket tycoon Lalit Modi, while the Opposition is busy encasing him and the BJP, the Narendra Modi government has now started preparing how it Pak got out of this matter

 yahi vajah he ki sarkaar kii ore se abhi bhi aadhikarik rup se lalit modi ko 'bhagoda' ghoshit nahin kiya ja sakaa he
