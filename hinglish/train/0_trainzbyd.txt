 In 2014, Narendra Modi contested from Vadodara in Gujarat and Varanasi parliamentary seat of Uttar Pradesh
 donon siton par unhen bade atanr se jeet mili
 Narendra Modi made a strategic decision to leave Vadodara seat and stay on Varanasi seat as it is said that the way to become Prime Minister goes through UP
 2014 main varanasi se chunaav ladane kii vajah se purvanchal kii 26 siton main se 25 par bijepi ne jeet hasil kii
 This time Modi won from Varanasi seat with a much bigger margin but lost 4 important seats in Purvanchal, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Ghosi and Jaunpur
 in siton par modi kii tsunami kaa asar nahin padaa or sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne is seat par jeet hasil kar lee
 Except Azamgarh seat, BJP won all other Lok Sabha seats in Purvanchal in Modi wave
 lekin ab jab kaha ja rahaa he ki 2019 main modi lahar tsunami main tabdeel ho gai, tab bijepi kii pakad purvanchal se dhili pad gai
 The coalition overshadowed the Modi magic around Prime Minister Modi's parliamentary seat
 kin siton par mili haar?azamgarhmodi tsunami hone kaa party kii ore se daawa kiya ja rahaa tha
 This tsunami was neutral in the Azamgarh parliamentary seat
 sapa mukhiya or upi ke purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne mulaayam singh kii sansadeey seat se chunaav ladane kaa faisla kiya
 His decision was justified

 6,21,578 to Akhilesh Yadav (60
 4%) vot pade, vahiin nirahua ko 3,61,704(35%) mat pade
 Even in the Modi wave, Akhilesh managed to win the election with a huge margin
 gajipurgajipur kii seat bijepi haar chuki he
 Afzal Ansari has received 5,66,082 votes while Manoj Sinha has got 4,46,690 votes
 is seat se 2014 main manoj sinha ko jeet mili thi
 SP-BSP and RLD alliance candidate Afzal Ansari has managed to win this seat
 manoj sinha kendriya mantri bhi hai
 Manoj Sinha defeated SP candidate Shivakanya Kushwaha by a margin of 32,452 votes
 manoj sinha ko 2014 ke chunaav main 3,06,929 vot mili jabaki duusare sthaan par rahi shivakanya ko 2,74,477 (27
 82 per cent) of the votes were received
 ghosighosi loksabhaa seat main bhi sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne send maar lee

 3%) vot mili vahiin bijepi pratyaashee or maujuuda saansad harinarayan ko kul 4,51,261(39
 56%) votes
 yah seat kabhi bijepi ke khate main nahin rahi
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won this seat for the first time
 bijepi kii ore se harinarayan rajbhar ne basapa ke daara singh chouhan ko maat di thi
 Harinarayan Rajbhar received a total of 3,79797 votes on this seat while Dara Singh of BSP received 2,33,782 votes
 harinarayan ne yah chunaav 1,46,015 maton ke antar se jeeta tha
 The Jaunpur seat, one of the most important seats in Jaunpur East Zone, was also affected by the Modi tsunami
 is seat par bahujan samaaj party ke pratyaashee shyaam singh yadav ko jeet mili
 Shyam Singh Yadav got 5,21,128 votes from Jaunpur seat while Krishna Pratap Singh of BJP got 4,40,192 votes
 2014 ke modi lahar main bijepi ne is seat par kabja kiya tha
 Krishna Pratap Singh of BJP defeated Subhash Pandey of Bahujan Samaj Party by a margin of 1,46,310 votes
 krishna ko 3,67,149 (36
 45%) votes while Subhash Pandey got 2,20,839 (21
 93%) mat mili the
 This time it was being said by the party that the Modi wave has now turned into a tsunami but it was helpless in front of the dam of the tsunami alliance here
 purvanchal ke antargat kul 26 loksabhaa siten aati hai
 These seats include Kushinagar, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Bansgaon, Faizabad, Bahraich, Shravasti, Gonda, Dumriaganj, Maharajganj, Ambedkaranagar, Basti, Sant Kabir Nagar, Azamgarh, Ghosi, Salempur, Ballia, Jaunpur, Ghazipur, Chandauli, Varanasi, Bhadohi , Phulpur, Allahabad and Pratapgarh seats are included in this
 modi tsunami bhi purvanchal kii 3 mahatvapurn siten nahin bachaa saki
 The SP-BSP alliance overshadowed the Modi wave in these seats
 bijepi bhale hi soch rahi thi ki ye sabhi siten bijepi ke khate main aaengi kyonki piem modi kii sansadeey seat se inaki najdiki he lekin gathbandhan factor ke aage modi maujik in siton par feekaa padataa najar aayaa
 In the 2014 elections, BJP got 71 seats from Uttar Pradesh alone, 2 seats were won by its ally Apna Dal
 2014 main murali manohar joshi apni sansadeey seat narendra modi ke liye khaali kar di thi
 The decision was not taken by the top leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 modi lahar main party ke netaaon ko bharosa tha ki agar modi khud purvanchal ke kisi seat se chunaav ladate hai to isse is kshetra ke aasapaas kii kai siten bijepi ke khate main aasaani se chali jaaengi
 Except the Azamgarh parliamentary seat in 2014, the BJP won all the seats in Purvanchal
 azamgarh loksabhaa seat se 2014 main us samay ke samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya or uttar pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri mulaayam singh chunaav lade
 Ramakant Yadav of BJP contested before him
 mulaayam singh ne ramakant yadav ko chunaav to haraa diya lekin jeet kaa antar keval 63,204 rakh paae
 It could also be said that the effect of Modi wave is that the difference of victory of such a veteran leader like Mulayam Singh has been so low
 lekin is baar akhilesh yadav ke aa jane kii vajah se bijepi ke khilaaf jeet kaa antar or zyada bada ho gaya
 Even in Modi's tsunami, the alliance managed to snatch 3 seats

 After giving sour and sweet memories to the world, now the year 2017 is going to leave
 is saal kisi desh ko vaishvik str par sammaan mila, to kisi ko aalochana jhelni padi
 2017 was a difficult year for China in terms of respect
 usko salbhar antarrashtriya manch par ninda kaa shikaar hona padaa
 Due to this many times China's fury also came to light
 china tamaam koshishon ke baavjood in mushkilon se apana peechha chhudaane main kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa
 Whether it was a South China Sea dispute or a case of helping North Korea
 china ko jaish-e-mohammad sargana masood ajahar ke maamle main or doklam vivaad ko lekar bhi vaishvik manch par fajihat jhelni padi
 Apart from this, many countries of the world condemned China for obstructing the expansion of the Security Council
 agar china ke liye salbhar kii uplabdhiyon ko lekar sankshep main kaha jaae, to yah saal uske liye acha nahin rahaa
 Let us tell you in detail on which matters China has suffered from criticism on the international stage
 
 
 
 
 1
 South China Sea dispute: The South China Sea (SCS) dispute has been a problem for China throughout the year
 prashanth mahaasaagar main sthit dakshin china sagar ek dweep samooh he
 It is a frontier sea, on which, like China, all the surrounding countries claim their sovereignty
 haalanki america or bharat samet kai desh china kii samprabhutaa ke is daawey ko khaarij karte hai
 Despite this, China is not deterring its antics
 vah yahaan par kritrim dweep bana rahaa he or lagaataar sainya abhyaas bhi kar rahaa he
 The US, Vietnam and other countries have had bitter statements with China about this
 america ne china ko chunauti dete hue apane yudhpot bhi dakshin china sagar bheje, jiske baad donon deshon ke bich tanaav bhi paidaa gaharaa
 2
 doklam vivadadoklam vivaad ko china ne hi paidaa kiya tha, lekin jab duniya ke saamne uski fajihat hone lagi, to vah baikfoot par aa gaya
 There has been a deadlock between India and China for about two and a half months regarding the Doklam issue
 haalanki yahaan bharat kii kootnithik jeet hui or china ko peeche hatana padaa
 India strongly supports Bhutan's claim on the Doklam plateau
 philhal doklam vivaad asthaayee rup se sulajh gaya he or donon deshon kii senaayen apni-apni simaaon par laut gai hai
 China did not benefit by creating this controversy, but it certainly made China a character of international condemnation
 3
 The rescue of Masood Azhar, the mastermind of the Pathankot terror attack and the rescue of jaish-e-mohammed mastermind Masood Azhar, also suffered embarrassment this year
 is maamle ko lekar bharat or america samet kai deshon ne china kii khulkar aalochana kii
 Actually, India is constantly trying to include Masood Azhar in the list of global terrorists, but China is putting obstacles in it
 chinaki adngebaaji ke chalate sanyukt raashtra main masood ajahar ko aatankiyon kii suchi main shaamil karne par aam sahmati nahin ban paa rahi he
 He saves Masood Azhar every time by abusing the veto
 wo aatankwaad ke panaahagaah or apane dost pakistan ke kehane par aatanki masood ajahar ko bachaa rahaa he
 4
 suraksha parishad ke vistaar main adngasuraksha parishad ke sudhaar or vistaar ko lekar lambey samay se maang chal rahi he, lekin is saal isko lekar kaaphi jorshor se aawaaj uthi
 Many countries including India, America, Britain, Brazil also took initiative for its expansion, but China continued to defy their efforts due to its rhetoric
 chinaki adngebaaji ke chalate is saal bhi suraksha parishad kaa vistaar nahin ho paaya
 At the same time, this act of China was criticized by all the countries together
 darasal, china suraksha parishad main bharat kii sthaayee sadsyta ko lekar behad chintit he or isi vajah se iske vistaar kaa virodh kar rahaa he
 He feels that if India gets permanent membership of the Security Council, it will be difficult for him
 5
 Support of North Korea: China had to face the sarcasm of many countries, including the US, throughout the year due to the Yarana relationship with North Korea
 uttar korea lagaataar parmaanu or missile pareekshan kar rahaa he
 This time he has done too much
 isko lekar america or sanyukt raashtra ne uttar korea par tamaam pratibandh lagaae
 However, during this time China continued to help North Korea secretly and when it was revealed, the US attacked China desperately
 america raashtrapati donald trump ne uttar korea kii madad karne ko lekar china kii tikhi aalochana kii
 Not only this, US President Trump has clearly told China to rein in North Korea
 6
 India has been steadily trying to join the 48-member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) over India's membership of the NSG, but China has reservations
 lihaaja vah is saal bhi bharat ko NSG main shaamil karne kaa virodh karata rahaa
 However, many countries including the US openly support India's membership for NSG
 china kaa kahana he ki bharat ne parmaanu aprasar sandhi (NPT) main hastakshar nahin kiye hai, jiske chalate vah isaki sadsyta ke ayogy he
 Interestingly, China supports the membership of Pakistan for this and is trying to make it stand before India
 china kii is adngebaaji ke chalate bharat is saal bhi NSG main shaamil nahin ho paaya, jisko lekar bhi china ko antarrashtriya aalochana kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he
 The 48-member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) aims to control the export of nuclear technology and equipment

 Chandrayaan is currently circling around the Moon in its orbit and has been set in 100 km orbit around the Moon
 isro ke mutabik maanavrahit chandrayan ke is prayog ke teen makasad hai
 The first is to know how to land a mission on the moon
 doosraa chandramaa par soft landig ke liye jaruri takanic kaa experement
 The third is to take very close photographs of the lunar surface
 moon impact prob par radar ultimetre, ek hai rijolution camera, maas spectrometer ke saath hi kai mahatvapurn upkaran lagaae gaye hai
 Altitude will be measured continuously by the altimeter of the MIP moon
 camere ke jariye chandramaa kii sataha kii kaaphi kareeb se photo khinchi jaaengi
 The particles present in the atmosphere of the moon will be investigated with a mass spectrometer

 By providing signals from Earth, ISRO will separate MIP from Chandrayaan at a given time
 moon impact prob chandrayan se alag hone ke baad chandramaa tak pahunchane main kareeb 25 minute legaa
 During this time, MIP will take photos during their journey to the lunar surface
 jab emypi chandramaa se takaraayega to isse isaki sataha par ek gadhdha ban jayega or tej chamak ke saath uthegaa ek gubaar
 This collision will be monitored through Chandrayaan

 At the same time, Australia has started playing mother-games for this competition
 sidney pahunchate hi maxewal ne bayaan de diya ki bharat se darane kii koi jarurat nahin he, kyonki wo isse pehle teen maheene tak bharat ko lagbhag har fomart main haraate aae hai

 clark chaahate hai ki is pich ko tej gendbaajon ke makul banaai jaae or is par halki si ghaas bhi chodi jaae, jisase tej gendbaajon ko madad mil sake
 The Kangaroos have bowlers like Stark, Johnson and Hazlewood, who are able to take full advantage of any help
 lekin pich ne agar spin ko madad kii, to australia ke paas aisa koi bhi spinner nahin, jo bharat par ankush laga sake
 The captain of the Pakistan team, which lost the quarter-final match against Australia, has also said that India's spin bowlers in Sydney can upset Australia
 isiilie australia ke captain maaikel clark pich ko haraa rakhana chaahate hai
 But it is said that he who digs a pit for others falls into it himself
 bharat ke mohammad shami, umesh yadav or mohit sharma jis lay main hai, usase wo tej pich par or bhi khatarnaak ho sakate hai or australia apane hi bune hue jaal main funs saktaa he
 Overall, Clarke's concern is certain that Dabal is more on the home team than in the semi-finals

 pehali katha ke anusaaralanka-yuddh main brahmaji ne shriram se ravan-vadh ke liechandidevi kaa pujan kar devi ko prasann karne ko kahaor bataae anusaar chandi pujan or havan hetu durlabh 108 neelkamal kii vyavastha kii gai, vahiin duusari ore ravan ne bhi amarta ke lobh main vijay kaamana se chandi paath prarambh kiya
 Indra Dev brought this thing to Shri Ram through Pawan Dev and advised that the Chandi text should be allowed to be as complete as possible
 idhar havan saamagree main puja sthal se ek neelkamal ravan kii mayavi shakti se gaayab ho gaya or ram kaa sankalp tuutata-sa najar aane laga, bhay is baat kaa tha ki devi maa rusht na ho jaaen
 The arrangement of the rare Neelkamal was immediately impossible, then Lord Rama readily remembered that i am called Kamalanayan Navakancha Lochan, so why not offer an eye to fulfill the resolution and take out an arrow from the wind as soon as Prabhu Raj When the Goddess appeared, she appeared and held her hand and said - Ram, i am happy and blessed Vijayashree
 maanyaataaon ke anusaar duusari kathaek baar ravan ke chandi paath main yajna kar rahe brahmanon kii seva main brahman balak kaa rup dharkar hanumanji seva main jute gaye
 Seeing selfless service, the Brahmins asked Hanumanji to ask for the bride

 The Brahmins could not understand this mystery and said Aastu

 'bhurtiharini' yani ki praaniyon kii pidaa harne vaali or 'karini' kaa arth ho gaya praaniyon ko peedit karne vaali jisase devi rusht ho gayi or ravan kaa sarvanaash karvaa diya
 Hanumanji changed the direction of Ravana's yagna by making 'A' instead of 'H' in the verse
 kya kahati he teesri kathanavaratri parv se judi ek anya katha ke anusaar devi durga ne ek bhencerupi asur arthath mahisasur kaa vadh kiya tha
 According to the mythology, the gods were obliged by the concentrated attention of Mahishasura and gave him the boon of being invincible
 usko vardaan dene ke baad devataaon ko chintaa hui ki vah ab apni shakti kaa galat prayog karegaa or pratyaashit pratifalswaroop mahisasur ne narak kaa vistaar swarg ke dwaar tak kar diya or uske is krity ko dekhakar devtaa vismay kii sthiti main aa gaye
 Mahishasura has taken away all the rights of Surya, Indra, Agni, Vayu, Moon, Yama, Varuna and other gods and became the master of heaven itself
 devataaon komahishasur ke prakope se prithvi par vicharan karnaa pad rahaa he
 Then, angry with this daring of Mahishasura, all the gods created Goddess Durga to destroy the gods
 aisa mana jaataa he ki devi durga ke nirmaan main saare devataaon kaa ek samaan bal lagaaya gaya tha
 To destroy Mahishasura, all the gods had given their weapons to the goddess Durga and it is said that with the combined efforts of these gods, the goddess Durga became more powerful

 i first came to know about this in the year 2017 when Anurag called me and told me about it
 madhu, main or anuraag us ladki ke saath baithe or usne hamen puri dastaan sunai
 It was a shocking incident
 "unhone bataaya, "hamane turant is par ection liya or vikaas ko company se lambey vakt ke liye suspend kar diya
 We stopped him from producing or directing films and also withdrew his signature rights
 iske alaava hamane vikaas ko rihabilation centre ke liye bhej diya
 The girl agreed on all this
 vikaas jise is bare main kuch yaad nahin tha, hamane tay kiya ki is ghatana kaa likhit record rakhaa jaae
 "according to Motwani, Anurag told him after some time that the girl did not agree on settling the case
 aisa isliye kyonki uskaa boyfriend nahin chahta he ki us ladki kaa naam public main uchhaala jaae
 Anurag and Shubhra tried their best to convince him but his boyfriend was adamant on this
 usne kaha ki ham vikramaditya ko sajaa dene kaa koi or tarika dhund lenge
 "on the matter of remaining silent till now, Vikas said that he was still silent in the media because he felt that doing so would reveal the identity of the girl

 He directly blamed Vikas, saying that Vikas is sexually violent
 usne ek yuva ladki ko shikaar banaaya he
 Has betrayed his trust

 The wound will never go away and it is wrong
 unhone kaha ki vah ab jo kar sakate hai vah he maafee maangana
 Apart from this, what he can say is that this will never happen in his knowledge

 a news from Delhi has shocked everyone
 har kisi ke jehan main bas ek hi baat kaundh rahi he ki aakhir koi beti apane baap kaa katl is berahami se kaise kar sakati he? koi beti katl ke baad sirf maut kii tasdik karne ke liye apane baap ke seene ko cheer kar uske dil main laga pesamekar kaise nikaal sakati he? magar ab is sansanikhej katl ke baad jo sach saamne aa rahaa he, wo or bhi chaunkaane vaala he
 Don't know how many incidents of murder took place
 rishton ke bhi naa jane kitne katl hue honge
 But this one murder has shaken every person who heard the story of this murder
 seene main khanjar utarkar kaiyon ko maut ke ghat utaara gaya
 But here, a daughter takes a dagger first in the father's chest, then chases Sina
 iske baad us seene ke andar dil ko dhadkaa rahe pes mekar ko baahar nikaal leti he, taaki baap khanjar ke waar se batch bhi jaae, to bhi zindaa bachane kii koi gunjaaish naa rahe
 In Delhi's Khyala area, when the police solved the mystery of the murder of 56-year-old Daljit, he lost his senses
 darasal ye qatl kisi or ne nahin, balki ghar kii choti beti ne kiya tha
 In the conspiracy to kill his father on his own hands, he was supported by his two friends
 police tafteesh main is baat kaa khulaasa hua ki kulwinder ne apane do doston ke saath milakar apane pita kii hatya kii he or usne hatya kii saazish ek krime sho dekh kar banaai
 The police used to live alone with her father in Rajouri Garden area
 uski badi bahan kii shaadi ho chuki he, jabaki maa kii maut teen saal pehle ho chuki he
 After the mother's death, she was left alone at home
 uske isi akelepan kaa phayda uske pita ne uthaaya
 According to Kulwinder, her father started sexually abusing her, due to which she was very upset
 usne ye baat apane doston ko bataai
 Prince Sandhu, a friend of Kulwinder, used to make tattoos, while his other friend Ashok used to work in a mall in Rajouri Garden area
 teenon ne milakar katl kii sajeesh rachi
 As per the conspiracy, on the night of 29 April, the two boys reached Kulwinder's house
 iske baad teenon ne milakar kulwinder ke pita kaa cricket ke wicket se peet-petakar katl kar diya
 Then, in order to be comforted that the father was indeed dead, Kulwinder made several attacks on his father's chest with a sharp weapon and threw out the pacemaker in the chest
 police tafteesh main teenon ne apana gunaah bhi kabool kar liya he
 But after the murderers' iqbal-e-jurm, a question arises whether the story of Kuljit Singh's murder is told by Kulwinder and his friends, is it true or is the story behind it something else
 aisa ham nahin kah rahe hai
 Actually, this is saying Maktool's elder daughter and Kulwinder's elder sister
 uske mutabik uske pita aisa ghinauna kaam nahin kar sakate hai or uski bahan jhooth bol rahi he
 According to him, father used to stay out of the house for months
 ab sawaal uthta he ki jo amarjit kaa kahana he, agar wo sach he to phir kulwinder ne apane pita ke bare main police ko jhooth kyon bataaya? doosraa sawaal, kya pakade jane ke baad kulwinder or uske donon doston ne sazaa se bachane ke liye yon shoshan kii kahani banaai? teesraa sawaal, agar dalajit singh kulwinder kaa yon shoshan kar rahaa tha to phir usne ye baat apni badi bahan ko kyon nahin bataai? chauthaa sawaal, agar kulwinder kaa aarope sahi he or kisi vajah se wo yon shoshan kii baat apni bahan se nahin kar sakati thi to phir usne is maamle main police kii madad kyon nahin lee? paanchavaa sawaal ye ki tafteesh ke dauraan kulwinder ne aakhir kyon police ko har kadam par gumraah karne kii koshish kii yaa phir kuch aisi to baat nahin thi jisaki vajah se dalajit singh kulwinder ko rokte-tokate the or kulwinder ko apane pita kaa aisa karnaa pasand nahin tha or iske chalate usne apane donon doston ke saath milakar apane pita kaa qatl kar diya?police bhale hi is cese ko sulajhane kaa daawa kare, lekin agar kulwinder kii kii badi bahan kaa kahana sahi he to phir police ko dalajit singh ke qatl kii asli vajah kaa sach talashne ke liye ek baar phir se is cese kii tafteesh kerani padegi
 It is not as easy as it looks, in reality it was not so much
 police ko shuruyaat se hi qaatilon ne uljhane or gumraah karne kii puri koshish kii thi
 But he forgot that no matter how clever the killer is, he makes a mistake which brings him into the grip of law
 is cese main bhi qaatil kadam-kadam par galtiyaan karte chale gaye or aakhir main apane hi bune jaal main ulajh gaye

 khyala police kii ek team rajouri garden thane pahunchati he
 She tells two weeping sisters present in the police station that this is a picture of her father Daljit and she has been missing since 29 April
 donon bahanen unhi kii gumshadagi kii ittila thane main dene ai thi
 Actually both of these sisters were Amarjeet and Kulwinder
 police ko pataa chalaata he kii dalajit peshey se driver tha or apni choti beti kulvind ke saath rahata tha
 Kulwinder himself told the police that his father was 5 on the morning of the 29th
 00 baje kisi kaa phone aayaa tha jiske baad wo ghar se nikal gaye the
 He also told the police that Daljeet often stayed out of the house for weeks in connection with work
 police donon bahanon ke bayaan ke aadhaar par apni tafteesh aage badhaati he
 But during his investigation, he learns that Maktool was killed between 3:30 pm and 4 pm
 lekin jab police dalajit ke kol detail nikal vaati he, to use ye pataa chalata he ki makatool ko subah 5 baje koi phone nahin aayaa tha
 However, Daljit's phone was switched off from 4 am onwards
 itnaa hi nahin tafteesh ke dauraan police ko dalajit ke maalik ne bataaya ki dalajit ko us rose kahin nahin janaa tha
 The police were shocked on why Kulwinder is lying
 bas police ne kulvind kii kol ditels nikalwai to uske do doston ke number aae, jinase uski rozaana baat ho rahi thi
 Not only this, when the police did a location mapping of mobile numbers of Kulwinder and his friends, there were many shocking revelations in front of him
 masalan 29 april kii raat kulwinder or uske donon doston- prince or ashok kii lokation dalajit ke ghar par dikhaai di
 Not only this, where the body of Daljit Singh was found, the mobile location of these three also appeared there
 iske baad police ne kulwinder se poochtacha kerani shuru kii
 At first, Kulwinder tried hard to distract the police
 lekin jab usne kulwinder se sakhti se poochtacha kii, to wo tut gai or usne ikbaal-e-jurm kar liya
 But she was also shocked to hear the story of the murder she told the police
 kaatil police ke saamne tha or usne jo kahani police ko bataai use sunakar wo bhi chaunk gai
 But now he has to find out whether the reason for killing the killer is true or whether the motive behind this murder is something else
 kulwinder ne police ko bataaya ki wo apane pita ke saath rajouri garden ke makaan main akeli rahati thi
 Her elder sister was married and her mother died three years ago
 kulwinder ne police ko bataaya ki uskaa pita uskaa yon shoshan karne laga, jisaki vajah se wo behad pareshaan rahaa karti thi
 When one day his patience broke, he told his story to his two friends - Prince and Ashok
 iske baad teenon ne milakar dalajit ke qatl kaa plan banaaya or apane maukey ko anjaam tak pahunchane ke liye sahi vakt kaa intjaar karne lage
 Kulwinder and his friends were waiting for the right chance for the murder of Daljit and they got this chance on the night of 29 April
 00 baje
 On receiving Kulwinder's gesture, Prince and Ashok reached inside the house
 teenon ne ghar main ghuste hi pehle sote hue dalajit par kikret kii wicket se kareeb bees baar waar kiya
 During this time, the glass of the TV stand nearby was also broken
 kulwinder ko pataa tha uske pita ke seene main pesamekar laga hua he or isiilie kulwinder ne apane pita kii maut kii tasdik karne ke liye toote hue shishe ko hathiyaar banaakar badi hi beharmi se apane pita ke seene ko kaat uske dil main lage pesamekar ko baahar khinch liya
 The plan of all three was successful
 ab baari thi gunaah ke nishaanon ko mitaane kii
 The police do not suspect them, so they put Daljit's corpse in the car and threw it near a drain in Khyala area
 police ko gumraah karne ke iraade se makatool ke pesamekar ko tagaur garden ke paas phenk diya
 Police have also recovered from the accused the weapons used in the murder besides the blood stained clothes of the accused and the vehicle they used to hide the body
 lekin rishton ke qatl main sabase bada sawaal yahi he ki kya vaaki dalajit apni beti kaa yon shoshan karata tha, jisaki vajah se kulwinder ne apane pita kaa qatl kar diya yaa phir wo pakade jane ke baad bachane ke liye jhooth bol rahi he? police kii tafteesh main itnaa to saaf ho gaya he ki qatl kulwinder or uske doston ne milakar kiya he, lekin qatl kaa ke peeche kii asal makasad kya he, ye saaf nahin ho paaya he

 Led by Team India's ODI and T20 captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, India is going to play a series of two T20 matches against World Champion West Indies in Lauderhill, Florida on Saturday and Sunday
 na keval yah do badi tiimon ke bich muqabla he balki iske nattejey bhartiya team ke saphaltam captain mahendra singh dhoni kii dasha disha bhi tay karne vaale ho sakate hai
 Statistics show that Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been India's most successful captain in odis, T20 and Test cricket
 unki captaini ke kaushal par cricket ke kisi bhi jaankaar ko koi bhi shankaa bhi nahin he
 But for the last few days, many former cricketers and cricket experts have raised the demand to give Virat Kohli the captaincy of all formats
 aise main is siries main mili haar unki captaini par or baari pad sakati he
 West Indies have a slight upper hand against Team India, trailing 2-3 in international T20 cricket
 donon tiimon ke bich ab tak paanch mukaable hue hai jinamein se team india ko keval do maichon main jeet mili he
 Of course, this difference is not too big to be intimidated, but this year, the defeat of the World T20 semi-finals has been teasing till now
 aise main yah team india ke liye bahut mahatvapurn ho jaataa he ki wo donon hi mukaable main jeet darj kare
 
 
 
 lekin jeetna aasaan nahinvaise is saal bharat ne ab tak 19 tii20 mukaable khele hai jinamein se 15 main use jeet bhi mili he
 Defeated teams like Australia, Sri Lanka in T20 cricket, won the Asia Cup tournament and reached the semi-finals of the World T20
 yani aankadon ke lihaaj se bharat kaa pradarshan behtareen rahaa he
 Also, the West Indies, under whose captaincy Darren Sammy won the World T20, has been removed from the West Indies Board and given the reins to Carlos Brathwaite, who has scored four consecutive sixes in the final and will play for the first time under his leadership
 dhoni khud apni captaini ke liye diggajon dwaara hameshaa saraahe jate rahe hai or unke saamne anubhavheen captaini hona siries shuru hone se pehle hi unhen kai kos aage khadaa kar detaa he
 So defeating the Indian team will not be easy for the world champion
 phir hoga gail vs kohli muqablawestindies kii team ko do world tii20 dilaa chuke derren saimi kii gairmaujuudagi nishchit hi khalegi lekin kris gail or marlan sampuls, kirone pollard, dwen braavo, landle simons sareekhe visphotak cricketrs kii maujuudagi nishchit rup se world champion team ke pradarshan ko feekaa nahin hone degi
 The Indian team has cricketers such as Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah, who are in tremendous form, while captain Dhoni himself has a reputation as the biggest finisher of the shorter format
 aise main muqabla kaante kaa hoga yah maananaa nirarthak nahin hoga
 If won, then number one, if lost, if rolled India will be able to beat the world champion 2-0, then once again the ICC T20 ranking will reach the number one position
 haalanki use yahaan par yah kursi kiviyon ke saath share kerani padegi
 But if India loses the series 0-2, then the number-2 position in the ICC rankings will also be lost
 philhal 128 ankon ke saath bharat duusare jabaki 122 ankon ke saath world champion westeindies tisare number par he
 The Kiwi team sits at the top with 132 points in this list
 haalanki 1-1 se siries ke baraabar rahane kii sthiti main donon hi tiimon kii ranking main koi badlaav nahin hoga
 What does Captain Dhoni's record say? Dhoni's record of captaincy says that he has captained the team in more T20 international cricket matches than all the captains around the world
 jahaan dhoni ne 70 maichon main team kii aguwai kii he vahiin unke baad ireland ke porterfield (48) or westeindies ke world cap vijeta derren saimi (47) kramshah number do or teen par yani kahin peeche khadey hai
 Also, Dhoni has been the most successful captain in more than 35 T20 international matches
 unhone 42 maichon main bharat ko jeet dilaai he
 That is, Dhoni's record of winning 60 per cent of the matches will be called very good in the competition like T20 because the small teams here also give away the big sixes
 ab sawaal yah uthta he ki itnaa sab kuch hone ke baad agar team 0-2 se haar jaati he to kya dhoni kii captaini par gaaj giregi? cricket ke hukmran to chaahate hai ki team ke sabhi formet kii bagdor viraat ke haathon main aa jaae lekin saath hi kai diggajon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki dhoni ko khud is nirnay par pahunchnaa chahie ki wo kab ritairement lenge
 Dhoni also understands this well and in the face of losing to the West Indies, it will not be surprising if he is seen as the captain of Team India for the last time in the five-match ODI series against New Zealand in October

 Then how can i make people of the country who promotes terrorism in our country
 raju shrivastav itane par hi nahin ruke unhonen kaha ki pakistani actor or artist par bharat main bain laga dena chahie
 He told that he is not against artists, but how can a country that promotes terrorism in our country work with their people every day
 agar wo yahaan kaam nahin karegein to bollywood thapp nahin ho jayega
 Anyway, there are many new artists in our country who do not get the opportunity
 hamen pakistaniyon ko nahin balki unhen avasar dena chahie
 These are the same artists and actors who express goodwill through Twitter when the attacks on France
 lekin hamaare desh par jab aatankwaadi hamale hote hai to kuch nahin bolte
 It is important that Pakistani actors and artists be banned
 unako kaam nahin dena chahie
 This is the right way to protest against Pakistan and support the soldiers
 raju shrivastav ne kaha ki hamen ummid he ki modi sarkaar pakistan ke khilaaf karwai jarur karegi

 unhone kaha ki desh ke purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or indira gandhi kii suraksha main bahut kuch kamiyaan thim, lekin ab wo jamaana nahin rahaa
 Now Narendra Modi is the PM of the country and his security system is very high and impregnable
 sanjay raut ne kaha ki virdohi is tarah kii sajeesh rachate hai, lekin abhi is maamle main puraa khulaasa nahin hua he
 Some people from Maharashtra have been caught who have got the letter
 pune police bahut hoshiyaar he dekhnaa hoga ki nyaayalay ke saamne kya tathy aate hai
 He said that whether it is the Chief Minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis, Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the supreme leader of any other state of the country, no one should be taken careless in any security
 naa hi is maamle main kisi bhi tarah kii raajnneeti honi chahie
 The Prime Minister, the President or the Chief Minister, when someone comes to know about the safety of them, politics is first started on them, and they start seeing the advantage which is wrong
 aaj yahi ho rahaa he, lekin donon taraf se logon ko sanyam baratna chahie
 He said that a thorough investigation should be done in this matter, what will be revealed from the facts before the court
 unhone kaha ki,'aaj hamane saamana main likhaa he pradhanmantri ji kii suraksha itani abhedya he ki koi parinda bhi vahaan tak nahin pahunch saktaa'
 Sanjay Raut said that the Prime Minister has many enemies and because of this, this country has lost two big leaders but now our security system is very strong

 Until the two come together and talk in front of the media, we can only guess what would have happened in this meeting
 ghatak dalon ke saath bijepi ke sambandhon par sanjay raut kaa kahana he ki keval shivasena yah nahin bol rahi ki bijepi endie ke ghatak dalon ko puuchhati nahin, balki chandrababu naidu ne bhi yahi kaha, kasee tyaagi ne kaha he ki jediu bhi yahi baat bol rahi he or akali dal bhi yahi baat bol rahi he

 Sunni Waqf Board had ruled against adverse possession of Ayodhya, the claim was given by Jastis Nazir's decision
 During the hearing of the Ayodhya case, it was argued in the court by the Sunni Central Waqf Board in favor of its claim on the disputed land that adverse possession ( They now have the right to this land based on the principle of Adverse possession)
 lekin paanch jajon kii vishesh peeth ne unke is daawey ko khaarij kar diya
 The bench said that the Muslim side had failed to meet the conditions necessary for the adverse possession to be considered correct
 is nishkarsh par pahunchane ke liye justise abdul nazeer dwaara chaar saal pehle die gaye ek faisle ko aadhaar banaaya gaya
 Justice Nazir, while a judge of the Karnataka High Court, held that the possession must be 'genuinely' 'visible and exclusive' in order to be considered an adverse possession claim
 kya he pratikul kabja (adverse possession)sabase pehle ham aapako bataate hai ki pratikul kabja he kya? ise udhaaharan ke saath samajhaate hue mote taur par ham kah sakate hai ki maan liya jaae mohan naam ke shaks kaa dilli main apana makaan he

 Hearing the Ayodhya case, the court referred to the judgment delivered by Justice Nazir in 2015 and said, 'the concept of adverse possession considers hostile possession
 ' aage court ne kaha, 'ek vyakti dwaara kabja adverse possession hone ke liye nishchit rup se aisa hana chahie, jisamen wo kisi duusare ke adhikaar ko sweekruti nahin detaa ho balki usase inkaar karata ho
 Possession means that the occupier has a sense of ownership and control in his mind that he has a right over a property and can exercise this right
 "2015 ke jajment kaa aage zikr karte hue court ne kaha, 'bhoomi ko pratikul kabja siddh karne ke liye ye dikhaanaa paryaapt nahin he ki kabje kaa kuch kaam kiya gaya tha
 To be captured, it must have continuity, be aware of it and to the extent that it is contrary to the right of the owner

 a division bench of Justice Vikramjit Sen and Justice Sunil Gaur issued these notices on a petition filed by Analjit Singh
 nyaayalay ne ranbaxy ke sansthaapak parijanon ko 25 farvari tak apane jawaab daakhil karne ko kaha he
 Analjit Singh filed the petition last month challenging a single bench verdict
 ekal peeth ne anlajit singh kii us yachika ko khaarij kar diya tha jisamen unhone daawa kiya tha ki un par swargeey bhai mohan singh kii vasiyat badhyakaari nahin he

 Justice Ashok Kumar Ganguly, one of the two judges hearing the 2G spectrum allocation case, is due to retire that day, so a decision on Chidambaram's alleged role in fixing the prices of 2G spectrum is set to come on the same day
 maamle kii sunwaayee puri ho chuki he, lekin supreme court ne aktubar, 2011 main faisla surakshit rakh liya tha
 Now, with the close of Justice Ganguly's date of retirement, the judicial action has intensified
 agar chidambaram doshi paae jate hai, to ve grih mantri ke pad par nahin rah sakenge

 Raja is accused of selling the spectrum at throwaway prices and causing huge financial loss to the government

 In this case, the guidelines for giving approval to prosecute government officials will probably be set

 Given such a track record, court insiders say that Justice Ganguly will pronounce his decision before retiring
 iske alaava, mukhya nyaayadhish sakht niyam lagu karte hue apane kaam main teji bhi laa rahe hai
 Sources say, "the Chief Justice sends the list of pending cases these days to the retiring judges months ago
 justise ganguli kaa record rahaa he ki ve maamalon ko lambit nahin rakhte
 According to sources, Supreme Court judges often pronounce many decisions on the last day of their tenure
 ''agar kisi peeth kaa ek jaj faisla nahin sunaata he or anya jaj faisla sunaate hai to bhi vah apane chembar main un par dastakhat kar saktaa he
 The same can happen in the 2G case, which had Justice Singhvi along with Justice Ganguly in the bench hearing it
 ''justise ganguli un virale nyaayadhishon main shumaar hai jo badi hoshiyaari se apane shabd chunate hai or sateek tippanee karte hue faisla sunaate hai
 In his remarks on the size of the 2G scam in May last year, he said, "I have never seen so many except school mathematics
" '' isi tarah, aktubar, 2010 main unhone sibiai se poocha tha ki vah maamle kii jaanch main or kitna samay legi, ''das saal or?''november main unhone pradhanmantri kii ''niskriyata or chuppi'' par poocha tha or agast main bhrashtachar nivarak kanoon ko ''bhrashtachar sangrakshak kanoon'' kaha tha
 The Center had said that the Supreme Court should not cross Laxman Rekha by monitoring the investigation of 2G case
 sitambar, 2011 main ganguli ne kaha ki yah saamaanya aapraadhik maamla nahin he
 Then he made a strong comment, "if Sita had not crossed the Lakshman line in the Ramayana, Ravana would not have been killed
 lakshmana rekha ek seemaa tak hi kargar he
 Justice Ganguly will cross the Laxman Rekha of the Supreme Court on 2 February
 dekhnaa yah he ki us din unke irdagird kitne ravan dher hote hai
 In view of Justice Ganguly's retirement, the 2G case has gained momentum
 yadi chidambaram 2 farvari ko doshi paae jate hai to unhen grih mantri pad se istipha dena padegaa

 supreme court ne kaha ki hamaari salaah ke baavjood CBI or pashchim bengal police ke bich takaraar badi he
 The police have forgotten their primary role
 sibiai or pashchim bengal police ne apana rukh sakht kar liya he
 There is no administrative mechanism to resolve such conflict (between CBI and WB Police)
 afsos ke saath ham sweekaar karte hai ki hamaari salaah ke baavjood dushmani or aakrosh bad gaya he
 They have forgotten that the primary purpose and role of the police is to investigate crime, collect evidence and prosecute criminals
 court ne kaha ki sthiti gambhir he kyonki donon pakshon ne apana rukh sakht kar liya he or desh main police bal ke do wingon ke bich is tarah ke takaraav se bachane or hal karne ke liye koi prashasnic tantra nahin he
 Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, "the Bengal government and the police are trying to create our image that the CBI is only talking about air
 maano sibiai kaa makasad sirf rajeev kumaar ko dabochna he or jaanch se hamen koi lenaa-dena hi nahin he
 In this case, we are only building an air fort
 jabaki sachai ye he ki rajeev kumaar ke alaava anya chaar adhikariyon ko bhi hamane poochtacha ke liye notice bhej rakhaa he
 The CBI gave some documents and case diaries against former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar to the Supreme Court in Seelakwar and claimed that the agency wanted to interrogate Kumar in custody to get to the bottom of the scam
 peeth ke saamne CBI kii ore se pesh solicytor general tushaar mehta ne kaha ki is cese ke mahatvapurn saboot mobile phone or laptop rajeev kumaar ke nirdesh par aropiyon ko waapas die gaye or ye saboot nasht karne ke samaan he
 He cited the statement of the investigating officer in front of the investigating agency on mobiles and laptops
 unhone kaha ki rajeev kumaar poochtacha main sahyog nahin kar rahe hai or unki hiraasat main poochtacha jaruri he
 Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the West Bengal government, argued that the CBI wanted to interrogate the IPS officer for political reasons
 ab tak saboot nasht karne ke liye rajeev kumaar ke khilaaf koi exiaar nahin kii gai
 Earlier, Rajiv Kumar was questioned by the CBI in Shillong for nearly 40 hours
 gauratlab he ki farvari main sharada chitfund ghotaale kii jaanch ko lekar sibiai kolkata main police kamishnar rajeev kumaar se poochtacha ke liye pahunchi thi lekin police ne yahaan na sirf sibiai ko roak diya balki sibiai ke paanch afasaron ko bhi hiraasat main lekar thane le gai thi

 They answered me questions and when i proved my background and presented my weapon license, they let me go from there, but they did not let me meet Chief Minister Khattar
 tippaniyan Rana said, i take full responsibility and i agree that this is a mistake
 maine sachivalay main sambandhit adhikariyon ko bhi likhakar yah baat kahi he
 i went to the secretariat for the first time and i was not aware of the procedures

 Rana originally hails from Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh
 jab usase poocha gaya ki unhone sachivalay bhawan main daakhil hone se pehle yah hathiyaar kisi ke paas kyon nahin chhod diya to unhone jawaab diya, maine sochaa ki yah asurakshit hoga

 aakhir kyon hamaare ghar pahanane ke kapade alag hote hai or kahin baahar jane ke alag? kyon ham jab kisi se milane jate hai to achche se taiyaar hokar jate hai? darasal, jab ham kisi se milte hai to hamaari persenality or dressing hi pehla asar daalati he
 It is not that we meet anyone and they understand our behavior and thinking in a few minutes
 kisi bhi shaks par pehla asar hamaari persenality or pregentation kaa padataa he or ye baat mahilaon or purushon donon par hi samaan rup se lagu hoti he
 But a study done in the context of women has revealed the shocking thing
 ek taaja adhyayan ke mutabik, jo mahilaayein kam kapade pahenti hanunhen zyada kapade pahanane vaali mahilaon kitulana main adhik samajhadaar mana jaataa he
 Although these results are completely look-based, but it is really surprising

 He was shown two sets of photographs of some women
 ek tasviir main in mahilaon ne chote top, jacket or choti skirt pahan rakhi thi or duusare set kii tasviir main ek lambii skirt or sharir ko lagbhag puraa dhakne vaala top pahan rakhaa tha
 After this, these students were asked to give points by placing pictures on the parameters of loyalty, job, morality, personality, attitude towards sex, and understanding
 nateezon ke bare main bataate hue gaton kehete hai kitasviron ko dekhne ke baad zyaadaatar logon ne mana heki chote kapade pahanane vaali ladkiyaan apekshaakrit zyada samajhadaar najar aati hai
 However, this study cannot be considered the final truth as the number of people questioned for the research were very few
 gaton maanate hai ki chote kapade pahanane vaali ladakiyon ko ab bhi nakaaratmak mana jaataa he lekin unke sexi luk ko sakaaraatmakataa ke saath dekha jaataa he
 Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal addressed a rally at Sector 25 Ground in Chandigarh on Sunday
 haalanki, sabha sthal main zyaadaatar kursiyaan khaali dekhakar arvind ko apana bhaashan aanan-fanan main hi niptaana padaa

 arvind kejariwal ne jate-jate logon se yahaan tak kah diya ki wo jaldi main hai kyonki unako haryana main bhi ek raily ko sambodhit karnaa he
 On the other hand, despite being Sunday, the Aam Aadmi Party could not gather the public in its rally in Chandigarh
 sutron kii maane to jo log is raily main jute unako baahar se laayaa gaya tha or jo log kejariwal ko sunne ke liye pahunche the vah bhaashan khatm hote bhi chalate bane
 The Aam Aadmi Party has made former BJP leader and Union Minister Harmohan Dhawan its Lok Sabha candidate this time
 2014 main party ne bollywood abhinetri gul panaag ko chunaav ke maidan main utaara tha jo abhinetri kiran kher se chunaav haar gai thim
 Arvind Kejriwal in his brief speech targeted BJP MP Kiran Kher and accused her that she lives in Mumbai most of the time, as she is an actress
 abaki baar aam aadmi party ne purv bhaajapa netaa par daanv khelaa he, bataa den ki pichhali baar aam aadmi party 24 fisadi vot hasil karke tisare sthaan par rahi thi
 However, this time people are not happy with Kiran Kher, because she lives in Mumbai most of the time
 2019 loksabhaa chunaav main aam aadmi party ne chandigarh se kisi star ummidavaar ko tikat na dene kaa faisla kiya he
 It will be interesting to see if the BJP plays bets on Kiran Kher even now

 The Congress often describes the BJP as sick with 'modiphobia', but the party vice-president Rahul Gandhi issued a decree after which questions have been raised whether the Congress has even fallen prey to 'modiophobia'
 darasal, khabar he ki congress netaaon kii bayaanbaji par rahul gandhi ne roak laga di he
 Rahul Gandhi has created two media coordinators, without whose approval no party leader will make a statement

 That is, Congress leaders will now have to take permission to make a statement on Modi
 netaaon ko 24 ghante pehle hi apana bayaan bataanaa hoga
 According to Rahul's decree, to respond to Modi's statement, leaders will have to take approval from media coordinators and action will be taken against those who make statements without permission
 congress ke yuvaraj ke is aadesh kaa party ke netaa maanenge yaa nahin, ye to aane vaala vakt hi batayega

 kya ye apane aap main sanket nahin he ki pidipi kii raay ab badal gai hogi
 When Yechury questioned the police action in JNU, Jaitley said if the slogans of breaking India were raised then what would the police keep watching
 kya ye puraa jawaab he, kya vipaksh ne palatakar poocha
 Why did the police wait when Omar Khalid returned? yechuri ne neuyork times ke sampadakeey ko padhakar sunaaya jisamen kaha gaya he ki bharat main hinsak takaraav ho rahe hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his political allies are crushing disagreements
 vakil or bijepi samarthak bharat mata or deshadrohi bharat chodo ke naare laga rahe hai
 Journalists and students are under attack
 vaise yechuri bhartiya akhabaaron or channelon ko kot karte to pataa chalata ki koun chup he, koun uljhan main hai or koun mukhar, koun sampurna samarthan main he
 Can not claim but heard that when the Prime Minister went to visit America, the big newspapers there did not even give a place on the front page
 vahiin jab obama ji bharat aate hai to pehla panna to chhodiye netaa patrkaar sab obama ban jate hai
 But when we tweet on his praise, why not bear the criticism
 seetaram yechuri kaa bhaashan rashtrawaad, bahultawad, samvidhanwaad ko samajhane main madad to kar rahaa tha lekin jetali or bijepi ke netaaon kii isamen dilchaspee nahin thi
 He did not come to listen to the lecture, to ask why the slogans of India's ruin were raised
 par yah nahin pataa chalaa ki naare lagane vaale koun log the
 Those who were from JNU or outside or those who were caught were raising slogans
 is par sarkaar kii taraf se koi jawaab nahin aayaa
 Smriti Irani's speech is being discussed a lot
 aakraamakata or bhavukta kisi bhi rajaneta kaa achook hathiyaar he or iskaa istemaal sab karte hai
 But whether Smriti has gone beyond her dignity and dignity to be a Union Minister or she has established a new place in the art of speech
 kya unke bhav main satta kaa gurur bhi jhalka ki unki har baat hi satya he tathy he
 There is a difference between anger and anger
 rohit ko child kahati raheen jabaki wo 28 saal kaa noujvaan tha
 However, around the same time, the child whose death she was hurting, some supporters who took out a candle march in Rohit's memory and Rohit's mother had got the Delhi Police stationed
 agar smriti irani maa hone ke adhikaar se baat kar rahi thim to kya unka adhikaar rohit kii maa se bada tha jiske bete kii maut par loksabhaa main bahes ho rahi thi
 Mayawati can be defied, of course, but it is not very dramatic that she is pointing her finger and cutting her head
 kya baat galat nikalne par netaa sar tak kataa lenge
 We are questioning all this when his speech has become very popular
 unheen ke fasebuk par 14 lakh se adhik logon ne dekha he or hamaari apni site par aath lakh se adhik
 Abundance is being heard elsewhere
 bhartiya bhaashan panrapara ke lihaaz se us bhaashan main baha le jane ke saare tatv maujuud the
 It cannot be disagreed but can be disagreed with what he said
 jab ham sab smriti irani ke bhaashan ke ufaan main bah rahe the usee vakt kolkata kaa angreji akhbaar di telegraph or indian express tathyon kii jaanch kar rahe the
 The front page of the Telegraph is very much discussed these days, but many people did not like to call Smriti Irani an aunt national
 khub aalochana ho rahi he, bachaav bhi kiya ja rahaa he
 Some are calling it anti-women, while some are saying that Anti National has been written in the rhyme of Anti National
 kya smriti irani ko unke virdohi hameshaa unke abhinay ke daur ke frem main hi dekhte hai or kamatar samajhate hai
 If that is the case then it is a kind of reproach and maybe Iran's resentment is also a retaliation
 lekin kya yah bhi ho saktaa he ki smriti irani ko bevajaah hi aisa lagata he or ve iske bahaane pratikaar ke atirek main bah jaati hai
 In the Lok Sabha, Smriti Irani read the statement of the Telangana Police that when she went to university, the room was found open, the body was taken off the body and kept on the bed
 haath se likhaa hua suicide note tha jisamen kisi par aarope nahin tha
 Then KCR has an argument with the MP of the party and she further says that nobody has let the doctor close to the child
 police ne report kiya he ki bachche ko punerjeevit yaa bachaane kaa ek bhi prayaas nahin hua
 There was not a single attempt to take him to the doctor
 saadhe chah baje subah tak police ko vahaan pahunchane nahin diya gaya
 His body was used as a political weapon
 ye sab telugana police kah rahi he
 The comments pradhanmantri ne smriti ke bhaashan ko twit kiya he or likhaa he ki satyamev jayate
 But when our colleague Uma Sudhir spoke to that doctor, another truth came out but after this speech, Rohit Vemula's friend Zillarullah Nisha has given a video
 is video main aap dekh sakate hai ki ghatnasthal par police ke saath doctor bhi hai
 It is being claimed that the police and the doctor were called as soon as they came to know and Rohit's body was removed from the fan and placed on the bed in the presence of both
 hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne bataaya ki yah sahi he ki vemula ke shav ko subah saadhe chah baje hataaya gaya
 The Telangana police also say in their report that the police had gone into the room but the body was not allowed to be removed until the next morning
 lekin smriti irani ne kaha ki kisi bhi doctor ko use dekhne kii anumati nahin di gai
 No one attempted to save the child's revive
 jabaki uma sudhir se doctor rajshri ne kaha ki vah hyderabad central uniwarsity kii chif medical afasar hai
 As soon as she was called, she arrived in four minutes
 unke saamne shav ko utaara gaya or jab check kiya, koi dhadkan nahin bachi thi
 It was he who declared Rohit Vemula dead at 7:30 pm on 17 January
 use bachaaya nahin ja saktaa tha
 Dr
 Rajshree told NDTV correspondent Uma Sudhir that he had given the same statement to the police and told the same thing to the VC, but do not know why this is not there in the police report
 telugana police ab nahin bol rahi he
 The statement of the police is necessary because the Union Minister said only on the basis of the police report
 ab jab unki baat ko chunauti di ja rahi he, ye kaise maan liya jaae ki kendriya mantri sadan main jo kah rahi thim wo tathy hi the yaa vahiin antim tathy the
 Union Minister Irani also responded in the Rajya Sabha but was not as aggressive as the Lok Sabha
 loksabhaa main kaha ki raajnneeti nahin honi chahie, rajyasabha main rohit ke us fasebuk post ko padhane lageen jisamen usne marxvad kii aalochana kii thi
 In fact, Ambedkar Forum also criticizes the BSP, whether administrative lapses have any role in creating the circumstances of his death with the help of it or not
 ho saktaa he jo jaanch chal rahi he, usase ho
 When Smriti Irani was replying in Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of fuss
 seetaram yechuri ne kaha bhi ki mantri daantati hui lag rahi hai to mantri ne khandan kiya
 After a lot of fuss, his reply is not complete and the House adjourned till Thursday morning
 congress kii taraf se gulam nabi azaad sawaalon ko lekar mukhar rahe
 From the Vemula case to the violence of the lawyers, questioned the delay in the action against them and compensated for Jyotiraditya Scindia's weak speech
 jetali ne rajyasabha main bharat kii barbaadi ke naaron ko apane tarkon ke centre main rakhaa
 It is said that opposition cannot be saved only by condemning or distancing these statements
 jetali ne pidipi ko lekar saaf kiya ki kashmir kii mukhyadhara kii party se samjhauta karnaa kisi bhi rashtriya dal kii majaburi he or rashtrahit main he, ise lekar sharminda hone kii zarurat nahin he
 The opposition missed asking how the BJP differentiated between the PDP supporting Afzal and the few boys shouting slogans in JNU
 afzal ko lekar itani bahes hui lekin pidipi chupchaap rah gai
 Is this not an indication in itself that the pdp's opinion may have changed now? yechuri ne jeenyu main police ection ko lekar sawaal kiye to jetali ne kaha ki bharat ko todane ke naare lagenge to police kya dekhati rahegi
 Is this the complete answer, did the Opposition turn back
 jab umr khalid laut kar aayaa to police kyon intazaar karti rahi
 Yechury read a New York Times editorial saying that violent confrontations are taking place in India
 pradhanmantri narendra modi or unke raajnneetik sahyogi asahmatiyon ko kuchal rahe hai
 Advocates and supporters of BJP are raising slogans of Bharat Mata and anti-nationals Quit India
 patrakaron or chaatro par hamalaa ho rahaa he
 By the way, if Yechury used to quote Indian newspapers and channels, it would be known who is silent, who is confused and who is vocal, who is in full support
 daawa to nahin kar saktaa par suna he ki jab pradhanmantri america daure par gaye the to vahaan ke bade akhbaaron ne pehle panne par jagah bhi nahin di
 At the same time, when Obama ji comes to India, leave the first page, then the leader journalists all become Obama
 lekin jab ham unki tarif par chahakate hai to aalochana par kyon na sehamein
 Sitaram Yechury's speech was helping to understand nationalism, pluralism, constitutionalism, but Jaitley and BJP leaders were not interested in it
 wo lacture sunne nahin aae the, poochne aae the ki bharat kii barbaadi ke naare kyon lage
 But it was not known who were the people who raised the slogans
 jeenyu ke the yaa baahar ke yaa wo jo pakade gaye wo naare laga rahe the
 There was no response from the government on this
 smriti irani ke bhaashan kii khub charchaa ho rahi he
 Aggression and sentimentality is the surest weapon of any politician and is used by all
 par kya smriti apni lalkaar or hunkaar main kendriya mantri hone kii garima se aage nikal gayi yaa unhone bhaashan kala kaa ek nayaa mukaam kaayam kiya he
 Does the power of power in his sense also indicate that everything he says is true
 gussa or krodh main fark hota he
 Rohit kept calling him a child even though he was a 28-year-old youth
 phir bhi jis bachche kii maut par aahat wo garaz rahi thim thik usee samay ke aas paas rohit kii yaad main candal march nikaalane vaale kuch samarthakon or rohit kii maa ko dilli police ne thane main bitha liya tha
 If Smriti Irani was talking about her right to be a mother, was her right greater than Rohit's mother whose son's death was being debated in the Lok Sabha
 mayawati ko beshak lalakaara ja saktaa he magar neeche ungali dikhaakar or sar kataane kii baat kya ati naatakeey nahin he
 If something goes wrong, the leader will cut his head
 yah sab sawaal ham tab kar rahe hai jab unka bhaashan kaaphi lokapriy hua he
 More than 1
4 million people have seen him on his Facebook and more than eight lakh on our own site
 anya jagahon par bhi behisaab suna ja rahaa he
 From the point of view of Indian speech tradition, there were all the elements to be carried away in that speech
 isse asahmat nahin hua ja saktaa lekin jo unhone kaha kya un baton se asahmat hua ja saktaa he
 While we were all swept up in memory of Smriti Irani's speech, the Kolkata-based English newspaper The Telegraph and Indian Express were examining the facts
 telegraph kaa front pej in dinon kaaphi charchaa main rahata he magar smriti irani ko antee neshnal kahana bahut logon ko pasand nahin aayaa
 There is a lot of criticism, it is also being defended
 koi ise stri virdohi bataa rahaa he to koi kah rahaa he ki anti neshnal kii tukbandi main antee neshnal likhaa gaya he
 Does Smriti Irani always see her adversaries in the frame of her acting phase and consider her inferior
 agar aisa he to yah ek kism kaa tiraskaar he or ho saktaa he ki irani kaa aakrosh iskaa pratikaar bhi ho
 But could it also be that Smriti Irani feels like this unnecessarily and she gets swept away in retaliation under the pretext of it
 loksabhaa main smriti irani ne telugana police kaa bayaan padhaa ki jab wo uniwarsity gai to cameraa khulaa paaya, parthiv sharir utaar kar bistar par rakhaa hua tha
 There was a hand-written suicide note in which no one was accused
 phir kesiar kii party ke saansad se bahes hoti he or ve aage kahati hai ki kisi ne bachche ke kareeb doctor ko nahin jane diya
 Police report that there was no attempt to revive or save the child
 use doctor tak le jane kaa ek bhi prayaas nahin hua
 Police was not allowed to reach there until half past six in the morning
 uske shav ko raajnneetik hathiyaar ke rup main istemaal kiya gaya
 The Telangana Police is saying all this
 tippaniyan The Prime Minister has tweeted Smriti's speech and has written that Satyamev Jayate
 par jab hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne us doctor se baat kii to ek or satya saamne aa gaya lekin is bhaashan ke baad rohit vemula ke dost zilarullah nisha ne ek video diya he
 In this video you can see that there are doctors along with the police at the scene
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki pataa chalate hi police or doctor ko bulaayaa gaya or kamare main rohit ke shav ko donon kii maujuudagi main pankhe se utaar kar bistar par rakhaa gaya
 Our colleague Uma Sudhir said that it is true that the body of Vemula was removed at 6
30 am
 telugana police bhi apni report main yahi kahati he ki police kamare main chali to gai thi magar shav ko agali subah tak hataane nahin diya gaya
 But Smriti Irani said that no doctor was allowed to see her
 kisi ne bachche ke rivive yani bachaane kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 Whereas Dr
 Rajshree told Uma Sudhir that she is the Chief Medical Officer of Hyderabad Central University
 unhen jaise hi bulaayaa gaya ve chaar minute main pahunch gayi
 The dead body was lowered in front of them and when checked, there was no beating left
 unhone ne hi 17 janvari ko saadhe saat baje rohit vemula ko mrit ghoshit kiya tha
 He could not be saved
 doctor rajshri ne enditivi kii samvaadadaata uma sudhir se kaha ki unhone police ko bhi yahi bayaan diya tha or visi ko bhi yahi kaha tha par pataa nahin police kii report main yah sab kyon nahin he
 The Telangana Police is no longer speaking
 police kaa bayaan zaruri he kyonki kendriya mantri ne police kii report ke aadhaar par hi kaha
 Now that his point is being challenged, how can it be assumed that what the Union Minister was saying in the House was the fact or there were the final facts
 kendriya mantri irani ne rajyasabha main bhi jawaab diya magar loksabhaa kii tarah aakraamak nahin thi
 In the Lok Sabha said that there should not be politics, in the Rajya Sabha she started reading Rohit's Facebook post in which he criticized Marxism
 darasal ambedkar forum to bispi kii bhi aalochana karata he kya iske sahare uski maut kii paristhitiyaan banane main prashasnic chook kii koi bhoomika he yaa nahin is par kuch saaf nahin hua
 It may be from the investigation that is going on
 rajyasabha main smriti irani jab jawaab de rahi thi tab kaaphi nonkajhonk hui
 Sitaram Yechury also said that if the minister seems to be scolding, the minister denied
 kaaphi nonkajhonk ke baad unka jawaab puraa nahin hua he or guuruuvaar subah tak ke liye sadan sthagit ho gaya
 By the way, if Yechury used to quote Indian newspapers and channels, it would be known who is silent, who is confused and who is vocal, who is in full support

 When Smriti Irani was replying in Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of fuss
 seetaram yechuri ne kaha bhi ki mantri daantati hui lag rahi hai to mantri ne khandan kiya
 After a lot of fuss, his reply is not complete and the House adjourned till Thursday morning
 pradhanmantri ne smriti ke bhaashan ko twit kiya he or likhaa he ki satyamev jayate
 But when our colleague Uma Sudhir spoke to that doctor, another truth came out but after this speech, Rohit Vemula's friend Zillarullah Nisha has given a video
 is video main aap dekh sakate hai ki ghatnasthal par police ke saath doctor bhi hai
 It is being claimed that the police and the doctor were called as soon as they came to know and Rohit's body was removed from the fan and placed on the bed in the presence of both
 hamaari sahyogi uma sudhir ne bataaya ki yah sahi he ki vemula ke shav ko subah saadhe chah baje hataaya gaya
 The Telangana police also say in their report that the police had gone into the room but the body was not allowed to be removed until the next morning
 lekin smriti irani ne kaha ki kisi bhi doctor ko use dekhne kii anumati nahin di gai
 No one attempted to save the child's revive
 jabaki uma sudhir se doctor rajshri ne kaha ki vah hyderabad central uniwarsity kii chif medical afasar hai
 As soon as she was called, she arrived in four minutes
 unke saamne shav ko utaara gaya or jab check kiya, koi dhadkan nahin bachi thi

 doctor rajshri ne enditivi kii samvaadadaata uma sudhir se kaha ki unhone police ko bhi yahi bayaan diya tha or visi ko bhi yahi kaha tha par pataa nahin police kii report main yah sab kyon nahin he
 The Telangana Police is no longer speaking
 police kaa bayaan zaruri he kyonki kendriya mantri ne police kii report ke aadhaar par hi kaha
 Now that his point is being challenged, how can it be assumed that what the Union Minister was saying in the House was the fact or there were the final facts
 kendriya mantri irani ne rajyasabha main bhi jawaab diya magar loksabhaa kii tarah aakraamak nahin thi
 In the Lok Sabha said that there should not be politics, in the Rajya Sabha she started reading Rohit's Facebook post in which he criticized Marxism
 darasal ambedkar forum to bispi kii bhi aalochana karata he kya iske sahare uski maut kii paristhitiyaan banane main prashasnic chook kii koi bhoomika he yaa nahin is par kuch saaf nahin hua
 It may be from the investigation that is going on
 rajyasabha main smriti irani jab jawaab de rahi thi tab kaaphi nonkajhonk hui
 Sitaram Yechury also said that if the minister seems to be scolding, the minister denied
 kaaphi nonkajhonk ke baad unka jawaab puraa nahin hua he or guuruuvaar subah tak ke liye sadan sthagit ho gaya

 vitt mantri kaa daawa- RBI ko elactoral bond par koi aapatti nahin thimeshthi ke khulaase se yah khabar ai thi ki rigerv bank ne is par aapatti kii thivitt mantri ne kaha- sarkaar ke saath paraamarsh ke dauraan rigerv bank bhi shaamil thavitt mantri nirmala sitaraman ne kaha he ki bhartiya state bank dwaara elactoral bond jari karne ko lekar rigerv bank (RBI) ko koi aapatti nahin thi
 The Finance Minister made this claim in response to a question in the Rajya Sabha
 vitt mantri ne mangalvaar ko rajyasabha main bataaya ki jab elactoral bond ko lekar vichaar ho rahaa tha, to iske kai charnon main sarkaar ke saath gahan paraamarsh ke dauraan ek paksh ke rup main rigerv bank bhi shaamil tha
 It is to be noted that last month, an RTI revealed that the Reserve Bank had warned the Modi government about the issuance of electoral bonds
 modi sarkaar dwaara elactoral bond jari karne ke liye bill laane se kuch dinon pehle hi rigerv bank ne ek letters bhejkar sarkaar ko iske khilaaf chetaya tha
 The Reserve Bank had told the government that there is no need to change the existing system of receiving donations by the Electoral Trust
 artiai se hasil dastavejon se yah khulaasa hua he ki rigerv bank ne yah chetavanee di thi ki iske gambhir nattejey ho sakate hai
 What said, according to Finance Minister Nnews Agency PTI, the Finance Minister said, 'during the consultation process, he (RBI) had asked who would release it and what would be its proforma
 in sabhi baatcheet ko record kiya gaya he
 He did not object to the time SBI issued the bond
 'vitt mantri ne kaha ki rigerv bank ke kendriya board kii kamity (CCB) ne 11 oktober, 2017 kii apni ek meeting main apratyaksh rup se is par sahmati jaahir kii thi ki yadi esbiai iske liye taiyaar hota he to elactoral bond ko jari karnaa chahie
 The Reserve Bank had talked about various aspects of electoral bonds at the CCB meeting and at various other internal forums
 vitt mantri ne kaha, 'sisibi ne rigerv bank ke is rukh kaa samarthan kiya tha ki elactoral bond ko scrip form main na jari kiya jaae or yah kaha tha ki yadi sarkaar yah tay karti he ki esbiai ke dwaara elactoral bond scrip form main jari kiya jaataa he to rigerv bank ko iskaa samarthan karnaa chahie
 He said that the main reason behind issuing electoral bonds in a bearer was to bring transparency in the political system
 unhone kaha ki rigerv bank ne yah suzav diya tha ki elactoral bond ko dimat formet main electronic rup main jari kiya jaae, lekin isse donor kii pahchaan jaahir ho jaati or gopneeyata nahin rah jaati
 Apart from this, people who donate less than this amount are not able to take it easy
 abhi kii vyavastha main chanda dene vaale kii pahchaan tab hi jaahir ho sakati he, jab vah court yaa kisi anya pravartan agency se kisi maamle main aisa karne kaa aadesh ho
 When was released the Electoral Bond government introduced this bond in the year 2018 with the claim that it will increase transparency in political funding and bring in clean money
 elactoral bond finance act 2017 ke dwaara laae gaye the
 According to the data so far, a total of 12313 electoral bonds have been issued from March 2018 to October 2019, through which political parties have received donations of Rs 6128 crore

 unka pehla vanade pakistan ke khilaaf 1989 main 18 disambar ko pakistan ke khilaaf tha, lekin 2 gend khilne ke baad bina khaataa khole out ho gaye
 After that, he played his second ODI against New Zealand in Dunedin on 1 March 1990 and the same account was maintained here
 2 gend kheli or khaataa yahaan bhi nahin khulaa
 Tendulkar, who failed to touch even 40 in the first 8 innings, got the chance to wind the bat in his ninth ODI on 5 December 1990
 pune main srilanka ke khilaaf mukaable main unhone 3 maichon kii siries ke duusare vanade main ardhashtakeey pari kheli
 Tendulkar, who came out to bat at number five, scored 53 runs in 41 balls with the help of 7 fours and 1 six
 228 ranon ke lakshya ke jawaab main bharat ne 4 over shesh rahete 4 wicket khokar jeet hasil kar liya

 overol dekha jaae to tendulkar ne 463 vanade kii 452 pariyon main record 96 ardhashatak jamaaye jabaki unke balle se vanade main 49 shatak bhi nikle hai
 He also showed all-round performance in bowling and fielding
 balle se kamaal dikhaane se pehle unhone gendbaaji main kamaal dikhaaya or donon salaami ballebaajon ko out kar 2 wicket jhatak liye
 Both of these wickets proved extremely useful for India as the opening pair of Roshan Mahanama and Dhammika Ranatunga gave Netim a good start and added 52 runs for the first wicket
 17 baras ke tendulkar ke liye yah match har lihaaj se behad yaadgaar rahaa kyonki unhone kshetrarakshan main bhi gajab kaa kamaal dikhaaya or 2 ballebaajon ko kaich out karaane main apana yogadan diya, saath hi ek ballebaaj ko ran out bhi kiya
