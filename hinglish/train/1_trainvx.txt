 Australia's great leg-spinner Shane Warne turns 48 today

 Warne bowled English batsman Mike Getting in the Manchester Test against England on 4 June 1993

 Warne bowled quite outside the leg stump and looked like the ball might be wide, so Gatting did not attempt to play it

 "as a leg-spinner, you always think of putting a better leg-break ball," Warne said
 maine bhi thik usee tarah kii gend daalane kii koshish kii thi
 But, the ball swung to 90 degrees which was truly unique
 shen worne ne kaha, 'ball of da centuri' bilkul waisi hi gend thi, jo sabhi leg spin gendbaaj daalane kii koshish karte hai
 This ball changed my life both inside and outside the field
 mujhe bahut garv he ki maine gend 'ball of da centuri' daali thi
 Especially a great player like Mike Getting, who was a master of spin bowling in England team
 worne ne kaha, wo meri jindagi kaa sabase khaas pal tha

 uttar pradesh kaa shahar gorakhpur jo abtak dimag bukhaar se masuumon kii maut ke kalank se daagdar rahaa he
 That Gorakhpur is blessed with a grand festival these days
 upi satta ke singhaasana par virajman siem yogi adityanath isi gorakhpur shahar se aate hai
 Opposition is questioning the Yogi government, immersed in the celebration of the 3-day 'gorakhpur Festival'
 vipaksh ne kaha ki yogi sarkaar samvedansheel nahin rah gai he
 The city of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Uttar Pradesh has been decorated in Gorakhpur
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay ke parisar main 'gorakhpur mahotsav' kaa pandal siem yogi kii pasand ke mutabik hi dhaala gaya he
 Saffron colors are seen everywhere
 gorakhpur mahotsav kaa vishaal stage se lekar phulon tak main bhagava rang se sajaayaa gaya he
 Please tell that this is the second year of Gorakhpur festival
 pichley saal bijepi ke vipaksh main rahete ise yojit kiya gaya tha, lekin gorakhpur mahotsav kii bhavyata aisi nahin thi
 At present, the BJP is in power and Yogi Adityanath, the head of the state, comes from Gorakhpur
 aise main is baar mahotsav ko behad bhavy tareeke se ayojit kiya ja rahaa he
 Opposition is questioning the Yogi government on the pretext of a program being organized in the shadow of power in a luxurious manner
 gorakhpur mahotsav par sidhe sawaal khadey karne ke bajaae purv mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne aisi ghatana kaa zikr kiya, disane puure desh ko jhakzor kar rakh diya tha
 Let us tell you that 5 months ago, 64 children died due to lack of oxygen in Baba Raghav Das Hospital, the largest government hospital and medical college in Gorakhpur city of CM Yogi
 marane vaale mahaj 64 maasoom nahin the balki 64 pariwaron kii khushiyon ne hameshaa ke liye dam todaa tha
 These innocent people died in the wake of death because they could not get oxygen in time
 isaki vajah ye thi ki oxigen kii supplai karne vaali company ke mahaj 40 lakh rupye ke bhugtan ko roak diya gaya tha, jiske chalate company ne gas supplai karnaa band kar diya tha
 BSP spokesman Sudhindra Bhadoria said that the sensitivity of the Yogi government was over
 utsavo par vipaksh ke aarope kori siyasat maane ja sakate hai, lekin afsos to ye he ki gorakhpur kii hakeekat pradesh hi nahin saare desh ke saamne he
 That is why questions are being raised about this grand festival
 kya mana jaae ki ab 5 maheene baad monsoon kaa mausam phir aane par gorakhpur main bebas maasoom dam nahin todenge? is baat kii guarantee koi sarkaar legi
 
 gorakhpur ke maathe paradimagi bukhaar se bacchon kii maut gorakhpur kaa aisa kalankahai, jiskaa daag barason se is shahar par laga he
 Now by becoming the Chief Minister of this city, there was hope that the Yogi government would first remove this stigma of its city completely
 par aisa nahin ho sak he
 Even after the Yogi government came to power, the process of dying of innocent children continues
 monsoon peeche chhot chukaa he or shaayad sarkaar ke liye peeche chhot chuki he masuumon kii maut bhi hai

 While our aim is to pursue Bhojpuri in Purvanchal

 i wish it were so, but if it did not happen, is it not an insult to the overwhelming majority that BJP has got? kya ye satta kaa waisi hi rang nahin jiskaa abtak bijepi virodh karti rahi he

 kendriya mantri jayanti natarajan ne aaj kaha ki vidhansabha chunaav main congress kii haar ke liye rahul gandhi ko dosha na diya jaae
 He said that this is a collective failure of the party and the party will churn on it
 congress netaa ne vidhansabha chunaav main party kii haar ke liye party mahasachiv ko jimmedaar tehraae jane sambandhi baton ko khaarij karte hue kaha, 'congress van main sho nahin he
 It is a collective defeat and collective failure
 'unhone kaha, 'ham hamaari haar kaa manthan karenge, ham dekhenge ki ham kahaan galat hue or mujhe puri ummid he ki phir vaisaa hi hoga, jaisaa 1998-99 main hua tha, jab ham vidhansabha chunaav jite the or loksabhaa chunaav haare the
 As it happened in 2003, when the BJP won the assembly elections and lost the Lok Sabha elections
 'natarajan kaa bayaan aise samay main aayaa he jab bijepi madhya pradesh or rajasthan main vidhansabha chunaav main baari jeet kii taraf bad rahi he, dilli main congress kaa taj utaar chukaa he or chhattisgarh main vah kaante ke mukaable main hai
 There seems to be an agreement between Congress and Patidar Anamat movement leader Hardik Patel for the Gujarat assembly elections
 aarakshan ke mudde par congress ke rukh ko lekar ultimatum dene ke baad hardik patel ab naram padate dikhaai de rahe hai
 Hardik Patel has said that he will neither support, nor oppose, the public meeting of Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi to be held in Surat on 3 November
 hardik patel ne kaha ki congress ne is masale par jo kanoonee raay kaa intjaar karne kii baat kahi he, vah bhi uskaa intjaar karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 He said that the Patidars will wait for the Congress plan on reservation till 7 November
 hardik ne ye bhi kaha ki rahul gandhi khud is maamle main baat karnaa chaahate hai to ham jaakar baat karenge
 In fact, on 4 issues out of 5, Hardik Patel warned that if the Congress did not clarify its stand on Patel society, it would be opposed
 jiske baad somvaar ko patidaaron ke saath congress netaaon ne meeting kii
 After the meeting, Hardik said that 4 out of five issues of Patel society have been agreed with the Congress
 pehla mudda:aarakshan andolan main hinsa ke baad patidaar samaaj ke logon ke khilaaf darj cese waapas honge
 Second issue: Congress has promised that 290 of the 590 registered during the reservation movement will be withdrawn
 saath hi rajdroh ke cese bhi waapas honge
 Third issue: Congress has promised that after forming the government, financial assistance of Rs 35 lakh will be given to the families of Patidar violence victims
 saath hi parivaar ke ek sadsy ko sarkari naukari bhi di jaaegi
 During the Patidar Reservation Movement, the Congress has also assured of action against those who resorted to firing and lathicharge
 kangras ne kaha he ki sarkaar bane par is sambandh main jaanch samiti banaai jaaegi or doshiyon par kadi karrwai hogi
 Fourth issue: Congress has not made any promise in Monday's meeting regarding reservation for Patel's main demand
 congress ne aarakshan ke mudde ko technical bataate hue is par kanoonee raay lene kii baat kahi he
 The Congress has discussed with the lawyers and judges in this regard and assured the Patidars to clarify the party's stand
 paanchavaa mudda:congress ne sarkaar banane par 600 karod ke ayog ko 2 hajaar karod tak le jane kaa vaada kiya he
 This commission will be implemented on constitutional basis, which will be given central status
 dashakon se bijepi ko vot karte aa rahe gujarat ke patidaar is baar aarakshan ke mudde ko lekar naaraaz hai
 This is the reason that since 1995, the Congress, out of power in Gujarat, is engaged in every possible effort to take this large community along and cross its electoral stalemate
 yahi vajah he ki agle maheene ke pehle hafte main rahul gandhi ke gujarat daure se pehle congress patidaar netaa hardik patel se har sambhav mudde par sahmati banaakar unka khulaa samarthan hasil karnaa chaahati he
 This is Rahul's program, Rahul Gandhi will be visiting Gujarat from November 1 to 3 for the third phase of Navsarjan Yatra

 com / pxvuzeolrs — ANI (@ANI) November 24, 2019 Let us know, after the air pollution in Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is continuously attacking the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for contaminated water
 bijepi ne arvind kejariwal sarkaar par aarope lagaaya tha ki dilli jahrile pani se grast he
 The problem of water is the biggest problem of Delhi
 vahiin, siem arvind kejariwal ne kaha tha ki unki pani ke mudde ko lekar raajnneetik karne main ruchi nahin he or unka uddeshy nagarikon ko saaf pani muhaiyaa karana he
 He announced the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) decision to waive the development fee and infrastructure fee for water and sewer connections
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal pichley somvaar se uparajyapal anil baijal ke daftar main dharne par baithe hai
 Along with them Manish Sisodia and Gopal Rai are also on strike
 jabaki swasthya mantri satyendra jain kii tabiyat achaanak bighad jane se unhen aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya he
 For the last eight days, Kejriwal and his ministers have been frozen in the LG office away from government work
 vaise to dharna-pradarshan se kejariwal kaa purana naata he
 But if we take out the accounts of this time, it is known that Kejriwal is seen to lose less, gain more due to this strike
 kunbe ke saath LG daftar par dharnaes afasaron main chal rahi tanatani ke bich dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal pichley somvaar ko achaanak uparajyapal anil baijal ke daftar main dharne par baithe gaye
 He demanded that LG order the IAS officers of Delhi to withdraw the strike
 kejariwal kii maane to IAS afasaron kii hadtaal kii vajah se kaamkaaj par asar pad rahaa he, or dilli kii janata ke hiton main jo faisle liye jane hai usamen deree ho rahi he
 He connected the issue directly to the public
 chaar rajyon ke CM kaa mila samarthanuparajyapal se gatirodh ke bich kejariwal ke samarthan main khulkar chaar rajyon ke mukhyamantri utar aae
 On Sunday, the Chief Ministers of Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh appealed to PM Modi to intervene in the Delhi matter during the NITI Aayog meeting
 in chaaron rajyon ke mukhyamantri ne apana samarthan kejariwal ko diya or kaha ki ek chuni hui sarkaar ke khilaaf dilli main jo kuch ho rahaa he wo galat he
 9 parties support 9 parties including TMC, JDS, JDU, TDP, Shiv Sena, RJD, BSP, SP, RLD have justified Kejriwal's demand
 in sabhi partiyon ne ek sur main kaha ki dilli sarkaar ke saath sautela vyavhaar kiya ja rahaa he
 The leaders of these parties directly blamed the Modi government for this
 in 9 partiyon se samarthan se AAP ko apni maangon par or bal mila
 IAS officers had to come forward amid this deadlock when on Sunday, IAS officers made a press conference and announced that they would not go to the routine meetings of the ministers of the Delhi government until they were assured of security, it became clear that the officers of Delhi The routine of the government was not attending the meetings
 is bich kejariwal ne turant video massej jari kar saaf kaha ki afasar unke parivaar ke sadasyon kii tarah hai or ve unki suraksha kii puri guarantee dete hai
 Now if the officers break the alleged strike, it will be like a victory for Kejriwal
 samarthan main sadakon par jansailabarvivaar shaam ko AAP netaa or kaaryakartaaon ke dwaara mandi house se sansad maarg tak ke march ke baad kejariwal ne IAS afasaron se ek baar phir kaam par laut aane kii apil kii
 By the way, the party had appealed to the people of Delhi to take the road to gherao the PM residence
 party iske jariye apni takat ko dekhnaa chaahati thi, or sadakon par bheed ko dekhakar party gadgad ho gai
 Kejriwal is upbeat after seeing the supporters in the streets
 lekin in sabake bich kejariwal kaa dharne se puraa naata he, unki party andolan se hi nikalakar ai he
 In such a situation, sitting on a sudden strike, the opposition got a weapon to sit on them, and the AAP may also suffer some damage
 dharne vaali party kaa tamgaajab pichley somvaar ko kejariwal apane mantriyon ke saath uparajyapal ke daftar main dharne baithe to logon ke saamne unki puraani chhavi yaad aa gai
 bjp-congress also got a chance to say that Kejriwal also knows who the super boss of Delhi is, but he has sat on a dharna for show
 vipaksh ne aarope lagaaya ki dilli kii is bheeshan garmi pani kii killat or pradooshan se pareshaan hai, or mukhyamantri asi room main sofe par baithkar dharna politics kar rahe hai
 Development work in Delhi stalled, BJP and Congress are also trying to create an atmosphere at least in Delhi that Kejriwal's dharna has stalled the development of Delhi and stalled the work
 aise main party agar is dharne ko jari rakhti he to uske liye janata ko jawaab dena mushkil ho saktaa he
 This is also the reason that now there is no option left in front of Kejriwal except to end this dharna at the earliest
 hai court kii tippanee se jhatkis bich ye maamla ab hoicourt pahunchaa gaya he, or court kii shuruaati tippanee kejariwal ke samarthan main nahin kahi ja saktin
 Commenting on the dharna in the office of the Lieutenant Governor, the High Court has said that we do not understand whether it is a dharna or strike and whether any permission was taken or decided on its own
 court ne poocha ki agar ye khud vyaktigat rup se tay kiya gaya (kejariwal or mantriyon dwaara) faisla he to ye alji ke daftar ke baahar hona chahie tha
 Is permission taken for this picket inside lg's office? The High Court said that how can you go to someone's house or office and sit on strike

 These leaders include Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar, Union Ministers Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Nitin Gadkari

 Nitin Gadkari fainted due to having low sugar

 Apart from this, Union Minister Anant Kumar died last year due to illness

 On Wednesday, Prasad has been shifted from AIIMS ICU to private ward
 unki haalat sthir he
 Manohar Parrikar, Chief Minister of Goa, Manohar Parrikar is fighting a battle against cancer
 parrikar agnashay sambandhi beemaari se grasit hai
 Parrikar underwent treatment in the US for about three months in early 2018
 iske baad dilli ke ames main bhi unka ilaaj chalaa tha
 He has been ill for almost 11 months
 nae saal ke pehle din vah drip lagaakar sachivalay pahunche the
 Arun Jaitley: Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is also running ill
 april, 2018 main unhen ames main bhartee karaayaa gaya tha, jahaan vah dialasis par the or baad main 14 may, 2018 ko unka kidney transplant hua tha
 During this time, in the absence of Jaitley, additional responsibility of Finance Ministry was entrusted to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal
 isse pehle sitambar, 2014 main jetali ne vajan kam karne vaali bairiatric surgery karai thi
 He underwent this surgery at Max Hospital in Delhi, but later admitted to AIIMS due to some complications
 kuch saal pehle vah heart kii bhi surgery kara chuke hai
 Sushma Swaraj: Union External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has announced not to contest the upcoming elections due to her ill health
 darasal, saal 2016 main kharaab tabiyat ke kaaran sushamaa ko ames main admit hona padaa tha
 After this he surprised everyone by tweeting one
 is twit main unhone kaha tha ki unki kidney fail ho gai he or vah dialysis par hai
 His kidney was later transplanted
 iske baad se sushamaa saarvajanik manchon par kam hi najar aati rahati hai
 Nitin Gadkari: Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari is also doing poorly
 pichley maheene vah ek kaarykram ke dauraan behosh hokar gir pade the
 His sugar level was lowered
 isse pehle vah dilli main sansad march ke dauraan behosh hokar gir pade the
 During this time he was the national president of the BJP
 anant kumarabijepi netaa or kendriya mantri rahe anant kumaar kaa november main nidhan ho gaya tha
 Actually, Anant Kumar was ill during the campaigning for the Karnataka assembly elections in 2018
 chunaav khatm hote hi, jab unhone doctoron se ilaaj karaayaa to pataa chalaa ki unhen fefdon kaa cancer he
 He died seven months later
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke maddenjar pradhanmantri narendra modi se lekar rajya ke mukhyamantriyon tak main shilanyas karne kii hode lagi he
 This is the reason that Nitish Kumar is also going to join the list of leaders who lay the foundation stone
 kuch maheene purv tak shilanyas kii samskruti main vishwaas naa karne or bihar main karyaarambh kii ek nai shuruyaat karne kaa daawa karne vaale bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhi ab pradhanmantri narendra modi kii tarah 'shilanyas karo' kii raah par nikal chuke hai
 In fact, just before the Lok Sabha elections, on Tuesday and Wudhwar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will lay the foundation stone of about one hundred schemes simultaneously in Patna and Nalanda districts, including power department, irrigation project, water supply, foundation of dental college etc
 inamen se kai aisi pariyojnaayen hai, jinako cabinet ne somvaar kii shaam manjuuri di he
 Until now, Nitish Kumar used to start a project in Bihar after the tender after approval from the cabinet
 magar ab mana ja rahaa he ki loksabhaa chunaav se thik pehle jaise pradhanmantri narendra modi ek ke baad shilanyas ke kaarykram main bhaag le rahe hai, vaise hi ab nitish kumaar ko lag rahaa he ki agar chunaav sir par he, to karyaarambh kaa intazaar kyon kiya jaye
 Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of Patna Metro within just four days of getting approval from the Union Cabinet
 iske alaava piem modi ne rajya ke kai aspataal ke nirmaan kaary kaa shilanyas kiya jiske nirmaan kaa abhi kisi ko kuch nahin pataa
 However, most of the foundation stones and inauguration programs by Nitish Kumar belong either to the Munger Lok Sabha seat or to the Nalanda Lok Sabha seat
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki nitish agar apane banaaye usulon se samajhota kar shilanyas ko lekar congress ke puraane model par chal rahe hai, to uske kaaran hai
 Where Water Resources Minister Lalan Singh, who is close to Nitish Kumar from Munger, is being considered for the candidature and all the schemes are being launched in a hurry, keeping in mind the old demands of the voters there
 vahiin nitish kumaar pichley loksabhaa chunaav main nalanda seat se bhale hi maamuli voton ke antar se jeet gaye the, magar ab vah use bhunane kii koshish karenge
 This time, Nitish does not want to leave Kumar to widen the margin of victory
 nitish kumaar anya jilon main bhi tabadatod shilanyas kaa kaarykram kar sakate hai

 Some people believe that the story of Rohit Shekhar Tiwari's murder is a bit filmy, but the reality is that he was murdered
 or katl kisi or ne nahin balki uski patni ne hi kiya
 During interrogation, the murderous wife also confessed her crime, but the answer to one question is that everyone wants to know what happened in just ten months of marriage that the wall of hatred between the two was raised
 baat 2017 kii he
 Rohit viewed Apoorva Shukla's profile at a metromonial site
 rohit ne is bare main apni maa ujjwala ko bhi bataaya
 Then Rohit decides to meet Apoorva
 donon kii pehali mulaakaat lakhanu shahar main hui
 On seeing this, Apoorva liked Rohit's mind
 kuch dinon main hi donon kareeb aa gaye the
 And then both of them started living together in live-in
 donon kareeb saal bhar se saath rah rahe the
 Hence, on 12 May 2018, Rohit and Apoorva got married
 dilli ke ek five star hotel main shaadi samaaroh yojit kiya gaya tha
 In which many big leaders and officials and well-known people of the country attended
 shaadi ke baad rohit kii maa ujjwala bahut khush thi
 After marriage, Apoorva came to stay with her husband Rohit at their home in Defense Colony, Delhi
 donon kii gruhasthi jam chuki thi, lekin kuch dinon baad hi apurva ko ek mahila ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Who was the wife of a relative of Rohit
 wo mahila rohit ke kareeb maani jaati thi
 Just from here, 'woh' was entered in this story
 shaadi ke kuch maheene bhi nahin beete the ki donon ke bich talkhiyaan badhane lagi
 The image of Rohit that remained in Apoorva's mind was becoming bleak
 jabaki, rohit us mahila ke kareeb hote ja rahe the
 Rohit used to visit the woman often
 apurva ko yah baat gavaara nahin thi
 There was a dispute between the two
 aae din is baat ko lekar rohit or apurva ke bich kahasuni ho jaati thi
 It was learned that Apoorva often asked Rohit for a house for his family members
 lekin is baat par koi pratikriya nahin detaa tha
 The matter had now reached Ujjwala
 maamla bigadate dekh baat talaak tak ja pahunchi
 After the discussion, it was decided that the talks would be held in June
 kahasuni or jhagade ke baad apurva 3 march ko apane maayke indore chali gai
 She stayed there till 29 March
 iske baad apurva 30 march ko waapas dephence colony main rohit ke paas aa gai
 There was a Lok Sabha election in Uttarakhand on 11 April
 rohit or ujjwala ko vot daalane ke liye vahaan janaa tha
 When Rohit went there, he had taken that lady friend along with him, due to which Apurva was angry
 isi bich ek ghatana ghati
 Which created a rift between Rohit and Apoorva
 hua yun ki jab rohit kathgodam, uttarakhand main tha
 Meanwhile, Apoorva made a video call on Rohit's mobile phone
 jisamen apurva ko wo mahila dikh gai
 Who was drinking alcohol with Rohit at that time
 kuch sutron kaa maananaa he ki rohit us mahila ke saath us vakt aapattijanak haalat main the
 Rohit tried to hide the woman but Apoorva had seen the woman
 is ghatana ke baad apurva kaa dil tut gaya
 His anger was on the seventh sky
 phone par bhi rohit se apurva kii kahasuni hone kii baat saamne ai
 Apoorva was very disappointed and sad
 bataaya ye bhi jaataa he ki wo mahila jab garbhvatee thi, to apurva ko shaq hua ki uski kokh main pal rahi santan rohit kii to nahin
 However, the police, in its investigation, completely denied this
 15 april ko rohit apni maa or bhai ke saath lautakar waapas dilli main apane ghar aa gaya
 That night, Rohit's defense colony house had Rohit's wife Apoorva, elder brother Siddharth Sharma, maid Martha, servant Golu and driver Akhilesh
 rohit kii maa us raat khaanaa khaakar tilak len dilli sthit apane sarkari awaas par waapas chali gai thim
 According to Ujjwala that night Rohit was alright
 bas thodaa se nashe main lag rahaa tha
 That dark night Rohit had gone to his room after having dinner
 raat ke kareeb ek baje kaa vakt tha
 Apoorva reached Rohit's room
 usne rohit ko jagaaya or us mahila ke bare main poochne lagi
 There was already a rift in their relationship
 maamla talaak kii naubat tak aa chukaa tha
 But Joe Tees was getting up in Apoorva's heart
 wo ek jakhm ban chuki thi
 There was a fight between the two about this
 baat hathapayee tak ja pahunchi
 Rohit was intoxicated
 gusse main apurva us par baari pad gai
 Despite not wanting, he put Rohit's mouth and throat with a pillow and killed him
 rohit kaa sharir thanda pad chukaa tha
 His body stopped moving
 dil kii dhadkane tham chuki thi
 His breath had left her
 ab rohit kaa sharir uske bed par laash kii shakl main padaa tha
 Apoorva sat on the bed right there
 uski saanse tej thi
 The heartbeat was racing like a train
 wo jaan chuki thi ki ab rohit kabhi nahin jaagega
 It was all over
 har shikawa gilaa rohit kii jaan ke saath chalaa gaya
 The storm in Apoorva's heart had stopped
 pati kii bevafaayee or andekhi ne apurva ko is kadar jhakzor diya tha ki usne apane haathon se apana suhaag ujaad diya
 Hence it is said that a woman can tolerate everything, but not infidelity of husband

 He does his best to put spinners on a regular basis, but he struggles when the conditions are favorable to fast bowlers

 Suicide is emerging as a major problem worldwide
 soshal media par live video ke jariye aatmahatya karne kii khabaren lagaataar aati rahi hai
 Recently there was a lot of uproar over a series of Netflix based on Suicide
 isaki relij par bhi roak laga di gai thi
 In this era of internet and apps, now a suicide game is coming out, which made Mumbai's year-old Manpreet a victim
 14 varshiya is chaatr ne kathith taur par is game ko khelkar 5veen manzil se chalaang laga di
 Now the police has issued an advisory regarding this game
 bharat hi nahin balki britain kii 15 varshiya ek chaatra neulia or 16 varshiya chaatra veronicane bhi apartment kii chat se chalaang lagaakar apni jaan de di
 What is this game and why is it motivating people to commit suicide? is ghatana ke baad vahaan kii police ne bacchon ke abhibhavakon ko agaah karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Actually it has come from social media itself
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki ek group he jo logon ko suicide karne ke liye uksaa rahaa he
 This group is more active on social media
 instagram par bhi isse jude post teji se viral ho rahe hai
 The group of this group gives daily tasks to its members which have to be completed in 50 days
 ye task kaaphi khatarnaak or jaanaleva hote hai
 These include tasks like harming oneself, moving around at a time which is quite strange or watching horror movies
 task ke 50wein din puure hone par is game ke peeche ke log yuvakon ko suicide karne ko kehete hai
 Not only this, they are also told about ways to suicide
 philhal yah saaf nahin he ki yah group kahaan se chalaaya ja rahaa he yaa is game ke peeche koun log hai
 There is also no information about how this game is being played
 haalanki is game kii satyata kii bhi pushti nahin kii gai he
 Some people say that it is being played by installing apps on smartphones, while some believe it is being played on social media such as Facebook and Instagram
 britain kii child protection sanstha neshnal socity for da privansion of cruality tu children (NPCC) ne kaha he ki bacchon ko bheed ko follow nahin karnaa chahie or aisi chijen karne se bachanaa chahie jo unke liye takalifdeh hai
 The Taliban rule will be established in just thirteen days and Swat, Sharia law will be implemented
 taliban ne pakistan ke puure malakand divijan main sharia lagu karne kii taarikh tay kar di he
 The date is 15 March and how will the rule of the Shari'a begin to appear
 pakistan kii swat ghati main ab taliban kii banduukon se goliyaan nahin chal raheen
 There is no need for bullets, because the Government of Pakistan is now shaken by hearing the words of Taliban leader Mullah Fazlullah and his father-in-law Sufi Muhammad
 isliye taharik-e-nifaaz-e-sharia-e-muhammadi ke sargana sufi mohammad ne puure malakand divizan main 15 march tak sharia court chaalu karne kaa farmaan sunaaya, to malakand ke kamishnar ghutanon ke bal daudte unke paas ja pahunche
 Sharia will apply in the Malakand Division, but the Qazis posted in Sharia courts will be regular judicial officers
 fark bas itnaa hoga ki malakand divizan main tainaat nyaayik adhikariyon ko qaazi kaha jayega, jo sharia kanoon ke hisaab se faisle sunaayenge
 Whereas, now the commissioner of Malakand Syed Muhammad Javed has gone to Swat, requesting Sufi Muhammad to deploy Qazi for Sharia courts
 yani ab sharia adaalaton main pakistan sarkaar kii pasand ke kaazi nahin honge, balki sufi mohammad or mullah fazalullah kii marzi kaa kanoon chalegaa, jaisaa ki samjhaute se pehle chal rahaa tha
 Apart from this, the Government of Pakistan has accepted another decree of Sufi Muhammad and Mullah Fazlullah
 pakistan kii sarkaar kal tak jinhen aatankwaadi bataakar jang lard rahi thi, unheen taliban ko ab wo swat main sir par bithaae gum rahi he
 Mullah Fazlullah's madrasa near Mingora has been declared an Islamic university
 jahaan mullah fazalullah bekhof hokar apane shagirdon ko dehshatgardi kii talim degaa
 The fate of the Taliban terrorists who were still maiming the people of Swat has now been decided in the hands of those terrorists
 khatra sirf yahi nahin ki taliban lagaataar taqatvar hota ja rahaa he, musiibat ye bhi he ki pakistani khufia agency or vahaan kii fouj taliban kii sarparast he
 In such a situation, the danger is again of a coup
 america seenetter jon kerri kii aguwai main atlantic council kii report ne pakistan kii jo tasviir pesh kii he wo vaaki daraavnee he
 Pakistan is reeling under tremendous economic crisis
 halaat ye hai ki pakistan kii arthvyvastha america or antarrashtriya bainkon kii madad kii mohataaj ho chuki he
 The Atlantic Council believes that the situation in Pakistan is once again pushing it towards a coup and it would obviously be against the interests of America as well as India if it were to happen
 swat to ek baangi bhar he, asal main taliban kii nigaah puure pakistan par tiki hui he
 They want to implement the law of Shari'a all over Pakistan and want to establish the secret of terror
 khatarnaak baat ye he ki unke kadam teji se islamabad kii taraf bad rahe hai
 In such a situation, the question is whether India is aware of the danger
 pakistan ke bheetar taliban auki alqaida kii takat lagaataar badhati ja rahi hai
 They are ready to occupy Karachi and Islamabad by migrating from tribal areas bordering Afghanistan
 auki ye baat khud pakistan ke raashtrapati jaradaari bhi kai baar kabool kar chuke hai ki unka mulk talibal ke khilaaf apane vajood kii ladaai lard rahaa he
 Pakistan has exposed its weakness by accepting the Taliban demand to implement Sharia in Swat
 sawaal ye he ki kya taliban kii mahatvakanksha pakistan tak hi simit he yaa phir wo pakistan par fatah karne ke baad wo karegaa bharat kaa moukh
 We cannot forget that the goal of the Taliban is to establish a nation beyond all borders where only Sharia rule
 aise main pakistan se bhi badi muslim aabaadi vaala bharat kya taliban ke agenda se baahar rah saktaa he
 Clearly, if the Taliban manages to establish its rule in Pakistan, then its target will be India
 wo bharat kii muslim aabaadi ko gumraah karne ke liye apni puri takat jhonk degaa
 The poison of terrorism he is now secretly putting in the veins of India, this bloody game of terror in the Taliban regime will run openly and then there will not be a government in Islamabad which will have any effect on the pressure of India or the world because Then there will be a forest of terror lekin pakistan main taliban yaa taliban kii himaayat karne vaali hukumat se sabase bada khatra he parmaanu hathiyaaron ko
 a weak country like Pakistan has a weapon of mass destruction and if these weapons fall into the hands of the Taliban regime, then it would be terrible to imagine what will happen
 kyonki ye khatra sirf bharat ke liye nahin balki puri duniya ke liye hoga
 The question is, are the powerful countries of India and the rest of the world serious about this danger? The threat from the increasing power of the Taliban is not just for India
 america bhi pareshaan he ki pakistan main taiyaar ho chuke aatank ke adde ko kaise khatm kiya jaae
 In fact, the US has now fully understood that the real front of the battle of terror is not in Afghanistan but in Pakistan
 pakistan ke upar america drone ke hamale jari hai or ye hamale jari rahenge kyonki afghanistan se lage pakistan ke ilaake aatankwaadiyon ke liye sabase bade panaahagaah main tabdeel ho chuke hai
 The US has now fully understood that the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan cannot be won in a decisive manner as long as the terrorists continue to be instigated by Pakistan and that is why America is now on every platform Let's not forget to reiterate where the real threat is in the fight with the Taliban
 america raksha mantri robert gates ne ek nijee televijan channel ko die intervyuu main saaf saaf lafjon main kaha ki aaj kii taarikh main pakistan na sirf al kaayda or taliban balki duniya ke sabhi bade aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke surakshit panaahagaah main tabdeel ho chukaa he or america ke liye ye sabase bada khatra he
 Gates said that though the names of all the terror groups in Pakistan are different, they always take action together
 america aaj jis baat ko kabool kar rahaa he bharat use ek arase se doharaata rahaa he ki america kaa ghoshit dushman taliban or alqaida or bharat ke dushman lashkar auki jaish bhale hi alag-alag sanghathan dikhaai dete hon lekin asaliyat ye he ki sabhi ek hi thali ke chatte-batte hai
 US Defense Minister Robert Gates himself was stationed in Afghanistan and Pakistan 20 years ago as joint director of the CIA
 lekin tab ladaai soviet sainikon se thi or unhone is baat ko kabool kiya he ki afghanistan main jang ke dauraan pakistan main adde taiyaar karne kaa unhen jabardast phayda mila tha
 The Taliban and al-qaeda are now using the same strategy against the US
 america sena ke joint chif of staff maaikel mulen ne bhi is baat par jor diya he ki america kii asli chintaa pakistan main dehshatgardon ke bade addon ko lekar he or is jang ko khatm karne ke liye america ko pehle is chunauti se nibatna hoga
 Now obviously the Obama administration does not want to repeat the mistake that Bush made
 unhone ye samaj liya he ki agar aatankwaad ko khatm karnaa he to unhen uski jad kaatani hogi or isaki jad pakistan main he

 When the Dalits started gathering at Gandhi Park on the call of the Bhim Army, the police drove them from there, causing a confrontation between the police and members of the Bhim Army and once there created an atmosphere of stampede
 tippaniyan As soon as the information about the confrontation between the police and the Dalits, the Dalits of several areas of the district took the front on Malipur Road in a rage and started assaulting passersby and setting fire to vehicles

 input bhashaa se Voting for the assembly elections is now less than three weeks in the midst of a high-voltage campaign in the southern state of Karnataka
 12 may ko 224 vidhansabha siton par ek charan main matdaan hoga or 15 may ko chunaav nattejey aaenge
 Let us see what issues are being discussed in the Karnataka elections
 kin muddon par karnataka kaa voter rajya kii siyaasi kismat tay kar saktaa he
 1
 siyaasi phase vailusiem siddharmaiya ke phase or rahul gandhi ke dhardaar abhiyaan ke bal par jahaan congress satta barkaraar rakh duusari pari sunishchit karne ke mishan par juty hui he to vahiin bijepi ko modi lahar or yediurppa ke lingayat card ke jariye satta main vaapasi kii puri ummid he
 At the same time, JDS is also preparing to become the kingmaker as the third player
 kumaraswami ne bispi ke saath gathbandhan kiya he
 Their strength also cannot be underestimated
 2
 How much of corruption stains? The issue of corruption in Karnataka elections is being thrown up very fast in the election campaign
 congress jahaan bijepi ke siem phase yediurppa par pichley kaarykaal ke dauraan lage bhrashtachar ke mudde ko uthaa rahi he
 At the same time, BJP alleges that during the rule of Siddaramaiah, more than 3000 farmers committed suicide in Karnataka, but their tea-biscuit bill kept coming in crores
 mysore kii raily main pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhrashtachar ke mudde par prahaar karte hue logon se sawaal kiya ki aapako kamishan vaali sarkaar chahie yaa phir mishan vaali
 On this, Siddaramaiah retaliated and targeted Yeddyurappa and even called PM Modi helpful in corruption
 is bich, tisare reddy bandhu ko tikat dekar bijepi ne phir se bellari ke mining mudde ko apane khilaaf istemaal karne kaa congress ko mauka de diya he
 3
 kisaanon kaa sawaal or mahadaayi kaa muddasiddharmaiya sarkaar ke saamne pichley 4 saal se jari sookhe kaa sankat chunavi musiibat ban saktaa he
 The politics over the sharing of Mahadayi river water from Goa is hot
 mahadaayi yaa mandovi nadi uttar-pashchimi karnataka ke belagavi jile ke pashchimi ghat ke bhimgarh se shuru hokar goa hote hue arab sagar main mil jaati he
 The Mahadayi River flows 29 km in Karnataka, while 52 km in Goa
 karnataka 2001 se hi goa se 7
 6 billion cubic feet of river water has been demanding to be released
 isse vah sookhaa prabhavit dharwar samet 4 jilon kii jaruratein puri karnaa chahta he
 Goa objected to this
 haalanki, bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kii pahal par disambar main goa ke siem manohar parrikar ne mahadaayi mudde par baatcheet kar pani kaa kota badhaane kii pahal kii
 BJP can benefit from this
 mahadaayi nadi kaa mudda uttari karnataka ke liye kaaphi ahm he or 25 siton par iskaa asar ho saktaa he
 4
 vikaas kaa agenda kahaan he?dakshin ke is siyaasi durg main modi ke gujarat model ke saamne congress kaa karnataka model chunauti pesh kar rahaa he
 Siddaramaiah claims that due to his policies, Karnataka remained the leading state in the country in terms of investment in 2016 and 2017 for two consecutive years
 siddharmaiya sarkaar kaa daawa he ki unhone ladakiyon ko muft shiksha muhaiyaa karai, rajya ko solar power main number van banaaya
 But the BJP rejects the growth story of the Congress government
 bijepi adhyaksh amit shah kaa daawa he- ‘congress or bhrashtachar kaa naata bahut gaharaa he, itnaa gaharaa ki jaise machhlee or pani kaa hota he or siddharmaiya sarkaar ne ise or bhi badha diya he
 Despite the IT sector being so strong, there is still no electricity for 24 hours
 swasthya va centre sarkaar kii skim bhi thik se abhi lagu nahin ho pai he
 More than 3500 farmers have committed suicide
 vikaas kii baat karen to sabhi maapdandon main congress neeche ja rahi he
 We will change this situation
 ’5
 Kannada pride question: Before the election, the issue of Kannada pride or Kannada self-respect is the most in the news
 congress ke siddharmaiya is mudde ko hawa de rahe hai
 Under this, Railways were asked to use Kannada language on tickets
 cempegoda international airport par kannada bhashaa main suchanaaen di jane lageen
 Many airlines started providing information in Kannada language
 isi abhiyaan ke tahat karnataka kaa alag jhanda hone kii bhi siddharmaiya sarkaar ne ghoshnaa kii or use cabinet se paas karakar centre ke paas manjuuri ke liye bheja gaya
 Regarding the assembly elections, BJP called it against the concept of 'one country', but Kannada pride has emerged as the biggest issue in the elections
 bijepi ko isse mushkilen pesh aa sakati hai
 6
 mathon kaa ganitakarnataka chunaavon main sabase mahatvapurn mudda dharm or jati kaa he
 The three parties contesting elections here - Congress, BJP or Janata Dal (S), are all engaged in the exercise of securing the power of Karnataka on the basis of religion and caste
 darasal rajya main vibhinn jatiyon ke math hai, jinke asankhya anuyaayi hai
 Among these castes, Lingayat, Vokkalinga, Kurub or Ahinda and Dalits are prominent
 kuch hissedari muslim votaron kii bhi he
 Therefore, all parties are engaged in favoring these caste-communities
 congress ne lingayaton ko alag dharm kaa darja dene kaa daanv chalaa he or iske jariye yediurppa ke lingayat card ko fail karne kii koshish kii he
 The same BJP president Amit Shah is calling it the Congress's attempt to stop Lingayat leader Yeddyurappa from becoming the CM
 7
 In Karnataka and BJP, Hindutva of South Karnataka, BJP is on the agenda of Hindutva in Karnataka
 karnataka ke dakshini zilon main jahaan muslim bahul ilaake hai use lekar bijepi or sangh ne maahaul banaaya he
 In the districts adjacent to the beach, the BJP has done a lot of work on the issue of Hindutva
 wo unka bana hua ground he
 If Siddaramaiah is claiming to hold Muslim votes, then through this card, BJP is trying to bring Hindutva agenda forward
 bijepi ke ek vidhayak ne to is chunaav ko hindu-musalamaanon ke bich kaa chunaav tak qaraar de diya
 According to the 2011 census data, there are 35 assembly seats out of total 224 in Karnataka where Muslims constitute twenty percent or more
 congress is votbank main jedies kii ore se send lagane kii sambhaavnaaon ko nakaarti he
 On one side of Mangaluru and Udupi districts of Dakshina Kannada is the Kasaragoda area of kerala where Muslims working in Gulf countries send money to their homes here and run Islamic organizations with this money
 vahiin islamic kattarpanth ke aarope jis sanghathan par lag rahe hai uskaa naam he piefai yani 'popular front of india'
 Its activism is in this area
 vishwa hindu parishad is ilaake main sakriy he or lav jihad se lekar land jihad tak ko charchaa main laane kii koshishen lagaataar dekhi gai hai
 8
 janata kaa ghoshnaptrrajya kii rajdhani or desh ke pramukh iti hub bangaleru main chunaav ko lekar alag hi maahaul dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 An independent group called 'citizens for Bengaluru' united people from different parts of the city and discussed the daily hardships that accompany it
 iske aadhaar par logon kaa ghoshnaptr banaakar sabhi raajnneetik dalon ko saunpa gaya
 In this, people talked about issues like traffic rules, pollution control, waste management and better plans for implementing new policies
 ab dekhnaa ye hoga ki ye mudde raajnneetik dalon ke agenda main kitna shaamil ho pate hai
 9
 dalit cardkarnataka chunaav main dalit card bhi kam myne nahin rakhata
 The Dalit community accounts for about 20 per cent of the state's population
 100 siton par dalit votbank asardaar he
 Of these, 36 seats are reserved for Scheduled Castes
 rochak baat ye he ki karnataka main dalit votbank banta hua he
 All parties have their own equations
 congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge dalit samudaay se aate hai
 While the Congress is trying to use the issue of changes in the SC / ST Act against the BJP, the BJP is vigorously calling it an attempt to spread the confusion of the Congress
 haalanki, daliton kaa madiga samudaay essi main aantarik aarakshan par ayog kii report lagu nahin karne ko lekar congress se naaraaz he or inkaa samarthan bijepi ko mil saktaa he
 Traditionally, Congress is considered to hold Dalit votes
 lekin 2008 ke chunaavon main bijepi kii jeet main dalit voton main swing bada kaaran mana gaya
 The BJP had then managed to win 22 out of 36 reserved seats
 haalanki, 2013 main congress ne vaapasi kii or inamen se 17 siton par jeet hasil kii
 JDS is also eyeing this vote bank
 bispi ke saath gathbandhan kar dalit voton ko apane paksh main karne kii wo lagaataar koshish kar rahi he
 10
 pichley chunaav ke baad badale hue sameekarnabta den ki 2013 ke vidhansabha chunaav main rajya kii kul 224 siton main se congress ne 122 jiti thi
 While BJP 40 and JDS held 40 seats
 bijepi se baghawat kar chunaav ladane vaale bies yediurppa kii kegepi mahaj 6 siten jeet saki thi
 Apart from this, others got 16 seats
 haalanki, baad main yediurppa dobaaraa se bijepi ke saath aa gaye or is baar siem ummivaar ghoshit hai
 The situation was completely different in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 bijepi 28 main se 17 siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi
 While Congress got 9 seats
 2 siten jedies ke khate main gayi
 With the help of Lingayat votes, Hindutva card, Modi wave, BJP is expected to return to power in this southern state
 dekhnaa hoga ki karnataka kii janata kin muddon ke aadhaar par janadesh tay karti he
 The hearing on the Uniform Civil Code was held in the Delhi High Court, after a brief hearing, the matter will be called till November 4 and November 15

 November 4 and November 15 have been fixed for hearing on behalf of the Delhi High Court
 mangalvaar ko sankshipt sunwaayee ke dauraan unifarm civil code par court ne kaha ki aaj lambii sunwaayee ke liye court ke paas samay nahin he, lihaaza agali taarikh par in janhit yachikaaon par sunwaayee hogi
 When the petition was put up for hearing before the Delhi High Court, the court questioned the need for this petition and also dragged the petitioners in this case
 court ne yachikakartaon se poocha ki jab alag- alag dharm ke logon ko apni paramparaon ko nibhaane kaa mauka mil rahaa he to use badalane kii kya jarurat he or kya in paramparoon ko badalane se koi sakaaratmak parivartan aayega
 However, the petitioners told the court that they wanted to present senior lawyers in the matter, so the hearing on the matter should be postponed for some time
 lekin shaam ke 4 bajane ke baad bhi jab yachika par sunwaayee ke liye court ke paas vaqt nahin bachaa, to court ne kaha ki ab is maamle main ham november main hi sunwaayee kar paaenge
 Let us tell you that on Monday a new petition was filed in the Delhi High Court regarding the Uniform Civil Code
 yachika main langik nyaay, samanta or mahilaon kii garima ko surakshit karne ke liye uniform civil code kii maang kii gai he
 The petitioner, in his petition, asked the court to direct the Central Government to form a judicial commission or set up a high level expert committee to draft the Uniform Civil Code
 uniform civil code par duusari yachika bijepi pravaktaa aswani upaadhyaay kii taraf se daakhil kii gai he, jis par dilli hai court pichhali sunwaayee main kendra sarkaar ko notice jari kar chukaa he, lekin sarkaar ne jawaab daakhil karne ke liye dilli hai court se samay maang liya he
 Jamia Milia Islamia has decided to reserve five per cent seats for the children of its employees, while the Delhi High Court abolished such a system in 1997 itself
 tippaniyan Some teachers of the university have raised this issue with President Pranab Mukherjee
 raashtrapati ke samaksh die aavedan main jamiya ke jansanchaar centre ke professor obaid siddiki ne kaha, ‘‘ucch nyaayalay ne 1997 main jamiya milia islamia ke sthaayee karmchaariyon ke bete-betiyon-patniyon ko die paanch fisadi aarakshan ko radd kar diya tha
 "the application said," Such reservations did not continue for nearly a decade, but the university has started the process once again
 ’’ haal hi main vishvavidhyalay kii kaaryakari parishad kii ore se yah faisla kiya gaya ki karmchaariyon ke bacchon ke liye sabhi kaaryakramon main uplabdh siton ke upar kii paanch fisadi siten arakshit rahengi
 This application of the teachers said, "it is a violation of the Jamia Millia Islamia Act
 daakhile or aarakshan se jude adhyadeshon ko nahin badla gaya he
 The university deliberately and maliciously followed the backdoor procedures to justify such reservations
 ’’ udhar, jamiya ke pravaktaa mukesh ranjan ne kaha, ‘‘ye maujuuda siton se upar kii siten hai or maujuuda siton main se nahin hai

 Bollywood producer Anand Pandit will soon introduce a new story in Bollywood through the film 'chehre'
 unki is film main bollywood ke do alag-alag diggaj najar aane vaale hai, jinamein se ek amitabh bachchan (amitabh Bachchan) hai to duusare imran hashmi (emraan Hashmi) hai
 Through this film, Anand Pandit will present a powerful thriller and suspense-filled story to the audience, with Big b playing the role of a lawyer and Emraan Hashmi as the business man
 apni apakaming film ko lekar anand pandit(anand Pandit) ne enditivi se baatcheet kii, jisamen unhone film kii shooting or bollywood kalakaaron ke vyavahaarake bare main bataaya
 Talking about the casting of the film, Anand Pandit said that Emraan Hashmi had never shared the screen with Bachchan sahab before this film, in which he was very excited to work with Amitabh Bachchan
 inke alaava khud big bi bhi film main nae artist ke saath kaam karne ke liye bahut utsahit the
 Not only this, Emraan Hashmi is quite fit in the role of this film
 a new cinematic journey begins with a power-packed team! Our next project starring @amitabhbachchan and @therealemraan, produced by @anandpandit and directed by # rumijaffery is slated to release on 21st February 2020! # APMPA post shared by Anand Pandit Motion Pictures (@anandpanditmotionpictures) on Apr 10, 2019 at 9:18pm pdtpilma kii shooting ke bare main bataate hue anand pandit(anand Pandit) ne kaha, 'shooting ke set par pahunchane se pehle imran hashmi apane saare dialog yaad karke aate the
 At the same time, Amitabh Bachchan is also quite punctual and is absolutely perfect about things even during shooting
 iske saath hi vah shooting ke samay apane kirdaar main puri tarah se kho jate hai
 The most important of these is that the last day of shooting, Amitabh Bachchan gave a 14-minute monologue in a single take, which has been the highlight part of the shooting
 "'chehre' ke produsar anand pandit ne amitabh bachchan or imran hashmi kii bonding kii bhi baaten kin
 He told that the chemistry of both of them during the shoot has been excellent
 inke alaava film main annu kapur, kriti kharbanda, raghubir yadav or riya chakravarti jaise kalakaar bhi najar aaenge or shooting ke dauraan yah sabhi set par ek parivaar kii tarah rahete the
 Moreover, due to their tremendous bonding, we have been able to finish shooting for 'face' four days ago

 ravivaar ko maharashtra sadan main kejariwal anna se mulaakaat karne vaale hai
 The meeting of Anna and Kejriwal is also important in the sense that in the interview given to Aaj Tak immediately before the Delhi Assembly elections, it was clearly said that Kejriwal forgot him after becoming the Chief Minister for the last time
 apane intervyuu main anna ne kaha tha, 'kejariwal jabase dilli ke mukhyamantri bane mujhase nahin mili

 What is speed, what is the law of motion
 newton ne gati ke liye kitne niyam die hai
 Read speed, vector, distance, speed and velocity to know them all
 gati (motion)adish raashi (scalar quantity ):waisi bhautik raashi, jinamein keval pariman hota he
 No direction, it is called scalar zodiac: like mass, speed, volume, work, time, energy etc
 note:vidyut dhara (current), taap (temprature), daab (pressure) ye sabhi adish rashiyaan hai
 Vector amount: Physical quantities that have direction as well as quantity and which are added according to certain rules of sum are called random amounts: eg velocity, displacing, force, acceleration etc
 duuri (distance):kisi die gaye samyaanterval main vastu dwaara tay kiye gaye maarg kii lambaai ko duuri kehete hai
 This is a scalar sign
 yah sadaiv dhanatmak (+ve) hoti hai
 Displacement: The vertical distance between two points in a certain direction is called displaced
 yah sadish raashi he
 Its s
 I
 The unit is a meter
 visthaapan dhanatmak, rinatmak or shunya kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Speed: The rate of displacement of an object is called speed
 athart chaal = duuri / samay yah ek adish raashi he
 Its s
 I
 Unit / se
 is
 veg (velocity ):kisi vastu ke visthaapan kii dar ko yaa ek nishchit disha main prati second vastu dwaara tay kii duuri ko veg kehete hai
 This is a vector sign
 iskaa S
 I
 maatrak me
 / From
 he
 Acceleration: Acceleration is the rate of change in velocity of an object
 iskaa S
 I
 maatrak me / se^ 2 he
 If the velocity of the object decreases with time, the acceleration is negative, which is called retardation
 vrittiya gati (circular motion )- jab koi vastu kisi vrutakar maarg par gati karti he, to uski gati ko vrittiya gati kehete hai
 If she moves with uniform speed, then her speed is called uniform circular motion
 samroop vrittiya gati ek twarit gati hoti he kyonki veg kii disha prayek bindu badal jaati he
 Angular velocity (circular and motion) The line joining a moving particle from the center of a circle on a circular path rotates at an angle in a second is called the angular velocity of that particle
 ise akasar ω (omega) se prakat kiya jaataa hai
 That is, ω = ѳ / t
 yadi kan 1 second main n chakkar lagaataa hai to, ω = 2π n
 (because in 1 round the particle rotates by 2π (360 °) radian) Now if the radius of the circular path is r and the particle rotates n in 1 second, then the distance traveled by it in one second = circumference of the circle xn = 2 πrn, this will be its linear speed
 yani ki v = 2 πrnv = 2π n x r = ω x r ( ω =2 π n )rekhiy chaal = koniya chaal x trigyanyuton kaa gati -niyam (newton 's laws of motion ):bhautikee ke pita newton ne san 1687 i0 main apni kitaab "princepia" main gati ke pehle niyam ko pratipaadit kiya tha
 Newton's first law of motion: If an object is in a resting state, it will remain in the resting state or if it is moving in a straight line at the same speed, it will continue as long as it But do not change its present state by applying any external force
 pratham niyam ko galileo kaa niyam yaa jadtv kaa niyam bhi kehete hai
 Inertia is the tendency of an object to maintain its state of rest or state of uniform motion in the absence of external force
 pratham niyam se bal kii paribhaasha milti he
 Definition of force: Force is the external factor that changes or tries to change the initial state of an architecture
 bal ek sadish raashi he
 Its s
 I
 The unit is Newton
 jadtv ke kuch udhaaharan:(i) thahari hui motor yaa railgadee ke achaanak chal padane par usame baithe yatri peeche kii ore jhuk jate hai
 (ii) On the sudden stop of a moving motor car, the passengers sitting in it lean forward
 (iii) kambal ko haath se pakad kar danda se peetane par dhul ke kan jhadakar gir padate hai
 Emotion: The product of mass and velocity of an object is called the momentum of that object
 athart samveg = veg x dravyamanayah ek sadish raashi he
 Its s
 I
 Unit kg x m
 / se
 is
 newton kaa dwitiya gati niyam ( newton's second law of motion):kisi vastu ke samveg main parivartan kii dar us vastu par aropit bal ke samaanupati hoti he
 And the momentum is in the direction of change Now if the force exerted is F, the acceleration produced in the direction of force a and the mass of the object is m, then f = ma from Newton's second law of motion i
e
 that Newton's second law gives the expression of force
 it happens
 note:pratham niyam duusare niyam kaa hi ang hai
 Newton's third law of motion: Each action is equal, but reacts in the opposite direction
 udhaaharan:(i) bandook se goli chalaane par, chalaane vaale ko peeche kii ore dhakka laganaa(ii): naav se kinare par kudane par peeche kii ore hat janaa(iii): rocket ko udaane main
 Principle of momentum conservation: If there is no external force on any group or body of particles, then some momentum of that body remains fixed
 yani ki takkar ke pehle or baad kaa samveg baraabar hota he
 Impulse: When a large force acts on an object for a short time, the product of the force and time interval is called the impulse of that force
 aaveg = bal x samay antaraal = samveg main parivartanaaveg ek sadish raashi he , jiskaa maatrak newton second (ns) he, tathaa isaki disha vahi hoti he, jo bal kii hoti he
 Centripetal force: When an object moves on a circular path, a force acts on it towards the center of the circle
 is bal ko abhikendriya bal kehete hai
 In the absence of this force, the object cannot move on a circular path
 yadi koi m dravyaman kaa pind v chaal se r trigya ke vrittiya maarg par chal he, to us par kaaryakari vrutt ke centre kii ore aavashyak abhikendriya bal f = m v^2 / r hota he
 Centrifugal force: Applying Newton's laws to a non -inertial frame requires imagining some forces that cannot be related to a body in the atmosphere
 ye bal chhadam bal yaa jadtviya bal kehalaate hai
 Centrifugal force is one such inertial force or pseudo force
 isaki disha abhikendri bal ke vipareet disha main hoti he
 Clothes drying machine, milk dispenser, etc
 work on the principle of centrifugal force
 note:vrittiya path par gatiman vastu par kaary karne vaale abhikendriya bal kii pratikriya hoti he, jaise "maut ke kuen " main kuen kii diwaar par motor cycle andar kii ore kriya bal lagaati he, jabaki iskaa pratikriya bal motor cycle dwaara kuen kii diwaar par baahar kii ore kaary karata hai
 Sometimes this reaction force acting outwardly is confused as a centrifugal force, which is totally wrong
 bal-aghurna (moment of force):bal dwaara pind ko ek aksh ke paritah ghumaane kii pravatti ko bal-aghurna kehete hai
 The force-moment of a force along an axis is equal to the product of the magnitude of the force and the vertical distance between the action line of the force from the axis
 [yani ki bal-aghurna (T ) = bal x aghurna bhujaa] yah ek sadish raashi he
 Its unit is Newton Mee
 he
 Simple machines: This force works on the principle of momentary force
 saral mashin ek aise yukti he, jisamen kisi suvidhajanak bindu par bal lagaakar, kisi anya bindu par rakhe hue bhaar ko uthaaya jaataa he
 Such as lever, pulley, inner floor, screw jack etc
 uttolak (lever):uttolak ek sidhi yaa tedi chad hoti he, jo kisi nishchit bindu ke chaaron ore swatantraapurvak gum sakati he
 There are 3 points in the lever: (i) fulcrum: The fixed point around which the lever rod can freely rotate is called the Alamb
 (ii) ayas (effort):uttolak ko upyog main laane ke liye us par jo bal lagaaya jaataa he, use ayas kehete hai
 (iii) Load: The load that is carried by the lever, or the blockage is removed, is called load
 uttolak ke prakaar:uttolak 3 prakaar ke hote hai:(i)pratham shrenee kaa uttolak: is varg ke uttolak main aalamb F, ayas e tathaa bhaar w ke bich main sthit hota hai
 In such levers, the mechanical advantage may be greater than 1, equal to 1 and less than 1
 iske udhaaharan he: kanchi, pilaash, sheesha, jhula, cycle kaa brake, hand pump aadi
 (ii) Second-class lever: In this square lever, there is a load w between the dimension f and amplitude E
 is prakaar ke uttolkon main yantric laabh sadaiv ek se adhik hota he
 Examples of this are nutcracker, lemon squeezer machine, a wheel drive cart etc
 (iii)tritiny shrenee kaa uttolak: is varg ke uttolak main aalamb f bhaar w ke bich main ayas e hota he
 Example pliers, farmer's plow, man's hand
 gurutvakentre (center of gravity):kisi vastu kaa gurutv centre, vah bindu he jahaan vastu kaa samast bhaar kaary karata he
 Therefore, by applying an upward force equal to the weight of the object on the center of gravity, we balance the object, regardless of the position in which it is placed
 vastu kaa bhaar gurtvakentre se thik neeche kii ore kaary karata he
 Therefore, we can keep the object balanced by applying an upward force equal to the weight of the object at the center of gravity
 santulan ke prakaar:santulan 3 prakaar ke hote hai- sthaayee, asthaayee tathaa udasin:(i) sthai santulan (stable equilibrium):yadi kisi vastu ko uski santulan sthiti se thodaa visthapit kiya jaae or bal hataate hi punah vah purv sthiti main aa jaae to aise santulan ko sthai santulan kehete hai
 (ii) Unstable equilibrium: If an object is displaced slightly from its equilibrium position and does not fall into a state of equilibrium, then such equilibrium is called temporary equilibrium
 (iii) udasin santulan (neutral equilibrium):yadi vastu ko santulan kii sthiti se thodaa sa visthapit karne par uskaa gurutvakentre (G) usee oonchai par bana rahata hai tathaa chhod dene par vastu apni nai sthiti main santulit ho jaati he, to uskaa santulan udasin kehalaata he
 Conditions of permanent equilibrium: For permanent equilibrium of an object, two conditions must be fulfilled: (i) The center of gravity of the object must be at most below
 (ii)gurutv centre se hokar jane vaali urdhwadhar rekha vastu ke aadhaar se guzarani chahie
 Union Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma said on Saturday that commercial relations between India and the US would not be affected due to the arrest of an Indian diplomat in New York and relations would become stronger
 fikki kii 86veen aam baithak se alag sharma ne kaha, "paripakv loktantron main mudde sulajhaaye jate hai
 In fact the process of partnership building should not be affected due to issues
 " According to Sharma, the current diplomatic dispute will not have any impact on the commercial relations between the two countries and they will only progress beyond the current situation
 sharma ne kaha, "bharat ne devayani khobragade ke saath kiye gaye durvyavhaar par naaraazgi jataai he
 But our relations with America are very important
 yah duniya ke do sabase bade loktantron ke bich ek ranneetik saajhedaari he
 This partnership is strategic in every way, so we will not break it

 Then why does this cruel world allow such uncontrolled torture in the cricket field? Why does the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Amateurs (SPCA) not intervene in such a humanitarian crisis? Purists would argue that India was on its way when Rahul Dravid gave up Mike Hussey's catch in the second innings of the first Test played in Melbourne
 Strayed from is kaich kaa chhotna mahangaa sabit hua or australia ne 27 ran par 4 wicket ganvaane ke baavjood duusari pari main aparaajey 240 ran bana liye

 It is probably wrong for Sachin Tendulkar to use harsh words
 unamem ab bhi ran banane kaa madda he
 But Sachin might want to recall the remark made by Mumbai's legendary player Vijay Merchant in which he said: You should retire when people ask why? Don't ask when? But Merchant belonged to the generation when the Test player received one pound sterling per day for spending on overseas tours

 Mumbai's sample capital Mumbai has been ranked at the top position in the country's financial capital Mumbai, while Delhi is at the bottom of the list
 biies kii jaanch main dilli ke sabhi 11 jagahon se ekatrit namoonay shuddhta ke vibhinn maanakon par vifal paae gaye jabaki mumbai main ekatrit kiye gaye sabhi 10 namoonay biies ke shuddhta maanakon ke anuroop upyukt paae gaye hai
 Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan on Saturday released its final report after BSI investigation of the drinking water sample
 ram vilaas paswan ne phir kaha ki dilli jal board dwaara aapurti kiya jane vaala pani pine yogya nahin he
 Paswan said, "the Prime Minister (narendra Modi) has set a target to provide pure drinking water to every household in the country by 2024
 isi silsile main dilli main 11 jagahon se pine ke pani ke namoonay ekatra kiye gaye the or praarambhik jaanch main namoonay vifal paae jane ke baad hamane desh ke vibhinn shaharon main nal dwaara aapurti kiye jane vaale pani kii gunvattta kii jaanch karwaane kaa faisla liya
 “in the first phase after collecting samples of drinking water from Delhi, in the second phase, water samples were collected from different places in the capitals of 20 states of the country
 pani ke in namoonon kii gunvattta kii jaanch karwaane ke baad in shaharon ko peyajal kii shuddhta ke variyata kram main darshaya gaya he jisamen mumbai pehle sthaan par jabaki hyderabad or bhubaneshwar duusare sthaan par hai
 One sample taken in both these cities has been found to fail on just one standard of quality
 raipur main bhi kharaab he panivahin, suchi main tisare sthaan par sthit raanch main pani kaa ek namoona gunvattta ke chaar maanakon par vifal paaya gaya he
 In fourth place is Raipur where five out of 10 water samples failed on three standards of quality

 Six out of 10 samples in Amravati have been found to fail on seven standards, nine samples in Shimla on one standard, all 10 samples in Chandigarh on two standards and all 10 samples in Trivandrum on three standards

 (with input of IANS) a post shared by Movie Bubbles (@moviebubbles) on May 22, 2018 at 6:30am PDTA post shared by Ashutosh Verma (@a xxrep 4 _ s xxrep 4 _ h xxrep 4 _ u) on May 23, 2018 at 3:19am PDT Union defense minister Rajnath Singh has cast himself as the 'best hunter' in the Narendra Modi government
 vah nape-tule antaraal par pakistan ke khilaaf aag ugalate, use chetate sunai dete hai
 Sometimes he claims about Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (pok), sometimes he is heard warning that India is not bound by the policy of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons
 abhi 24 ghante pehle hi unhone kaha ki pakistan ko jald hi antarrashtriya aatankwaad-virdohi ikai FATF dwaara blaclist kiya ja saktaa he; chah din pehle, rajnath singh ne pakistan ko uske tukade hone or 1971 main bangladesh ke gathan kii yaad dilaate hue 'sudhar jane' kii chetavanee di thi; ek saptaah pehle, apni ek puraani ghoshnaa ko doharaaya tha ki 'pakistan se bhavishya main sirf pok ko lekar baat hogi, jammu evam kashmir ko lekar nahin
 
 
 'rajnath Singh's arrival in this predator form has not happened suddenly
 vah narendra modi kii pehali sarkaar main bhi majboot, shant tathaa sakasham grahamantri the, or is alikhit niyam ko dhyaan main rakhkar shant bane rahete the ki modi ke mantriyon kaa dikhnaa zaruri he, sunai dena nahin
 This time, reaching from North Block (ministry of Home Affairs) to South Block (ministry of Defense) has changed them
 do hafte pehle hi vah swadesh-nirmit halke ladaaku vimaan 'tejas' main udaan bharkar aae, or us dauraan unhone apni pasandida poshaak dhoti-kurta chhodkar compresssont suut pahana tha
 PM Narendra Modi asked Rajnath Singh to play the leading role in India's all-round attack against Pakistan, as it has two benefits
 isse unke pradhan netaa narendra modi ko sabase zyaada aakraamak dikhne se bachaaya ja saktaa he, or ek vaishvik netaa ke rup main unhen bharat-pakistan ke mudde se upar uth chukaa dikhaanaa sahaj ho jaataa he
 This also makes it very easy to let Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan down that Modi does not even react to his statements, and despite Imran's hefty incitements, he leaves the responsibility of his ministers
 ghute hue rajaneta or RSS ke kareebi rajnath singh ne bhi is avasar ko lapka, taaki vah khud ko sangh tathaa BJP ke aadhaar kaa priy bana saken, jinke liye pakistan par hamale bolnaa hameshaa se pasandida kaam he
 So while Narendra Modi is positioning himself as the Global Gatekeeper, Home Minister Amit Shah takes a tough stand on Kashmir and Assam, and Rajnath Singh has taken over the responsibility of the cross-border battle
 bhartiya janata party (BJP) ke do baar adhyaksh rah chuke rajnath singh ne pehle khud ko kisaan netaa (upar dhoti kaa zikr bhi kiya gaya he) ke rup main sthapit kiya tha or apane bhaashanon ko apane rajnatik adarsh bhootpurv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi kii tarj par dhaalte the
 Actually, during a television interview i asked him if he attributes his gesture to Atal-ji, he laughed and said that both are from Uttar Pradesh, and the former Prime Minister has been his idol
 rajnath singh ke kareebi sutron kaa kahana he ki vah rakshaamantri ke rup main pehle se kahin zyaada taqatvar kaarykaal se behad khush hai
 Sources said, "honorable views were always like this, that's all, now he can express them publicly
 
 
 " haalanki puri tarah aisa nahin he, kyonki ab 'shikari mod' main nazar aane lage rajnath ne pehle kabhi khud ko shantidoot ke rup main bhi pesh kiya tha or kashmir main insaaniyat ke atal-ji ke vaade' kii baat karte the
 But that is the case then
 nae 'shikari rajnath singh' se sangh parivaar khush he
 By adopting this stance, Rajnath has also got an opportunity to differentiate himself from the Lutyens leadership of BJP
 rajnath ko swargeey arun jetali tathaa swargeey sushamaa swaraj ke saath tikdi kaa sadsy mana jaataa tha
 Now he has come out of that mold, and has become closely associated with the modi-shah duo
 yah party or sarkaar ke bheetar lagaai gai badi chalaang he
 This means that he will continue to issue such warnings to shake the balance of Pakistan

 sena pramukh ne kaarobaariyon ke saath kii baithksena ke kai anya adhikari bhi the shamilbadh sakati hai imran kii mushkilenkya pakistan main phir se itihaas doharaaya jane vaala he? kya pakistan main is baar bhi pradhanmantri paanch saal kaa apana tay kaarykaal puraa nahin kar paaenge? or kya pakistan main ek baar phir takhtapalat kii taiyaari he? pakistan ke andar se jo khabar aa rahi he uske hisaab se in saare sawaalon ke jawaab haa main hai
 The entire opposition of Pakistan was already engaged in evicting Imran Khan from power
 magar ab pakistani army chif jaranal bajva jaise hi sena kii vardi utaar kar suut-boot main ek meeting main pahunche in afvaahon ko or bal mil gaya
 Imran in danger, a meeting was held at the Pakistan Army Headquarters
 jise dekhakar mana ja rahaa he ki pakistan main maamla palat chukaa he or ab bas takhta palatney kii der he
 Think of that meeting as the trailer of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's coup
 kyonki karachi main yojit wo koi aam baithak nahin he
 Rather, there is a hint of Imran Khan's confiscation from the country
 countdown he pradhanmantri kii kursi main unke bache hue dinon kaa
 Because the army chief of Pakistan has now taken off his uniform and has worn pants-shirt and suit-boot
 bajva ne apane kalevar hi nahin tevar bhi badal die hai
 Army Chief Bajwa's meeting with businessmen Try to understand his intention with Pakistan Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa
 kyonki bajva ne sirf huliya hi change nahin kiya balki kirdaar bhi change kar liya he
 And now he has sat on the driving seat of Pakistan
 yani mulk par ab unka raaj chalegaa
 The rest is just announced
 varanaa sochie ki jin kaarobaariyon ke saath mulk kii aarthik niti par imran khan ko baat kerani chahie
 He is wearing a work suit-boot and is wearing a waistcoat
 karachi main mulk ke bade bijnesamenon ke saath bajva kii ye koi pehali meeting bhi nahin he
 Instead, he has also met with various businessmen at military bases in Karachi and Rawalpindi
 meeting main sena ke pravaktaa bhi the maujuudabaithak kii tasveeron ko dekhakar saaf pataa chal rahaa he ki vahaan peeche kii taraf kaarobaariyon kii is meeting main sena ke pravaktaa asif gafoor hai
 That is, this meeting is being done officially
 aapke zahan main ye khyaal aa saktaa he ki is baithak kaa imran ke takhtapalat se kya rishta he
 Many such questions can come in people's minds
 is baithak ko lekar tarah tarah ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 Two secret meetings have been held in the past
 Actually, two meetings were held in secret way earlier also
 jinaki jaankaree baahar nahin aa pai
 But now preparations are being made to remove the suspense built on this Imran coup
 kyonki baithak ke baad sena ne baqayada isaki jaankaree bhi di or ek press note bhi jari kiya
 Accordingly, Pakistan's internal security is related to its business, which is why the Army Chief today held a meeting with the country's big businessmen
 sena pramukh ne istemaal kii apni shaktiek taraf to pakistan ke bade bijnesaman imran khan kii nitiyon se pareshaan chal rahe hai
 On the other hand, this is the first time in 10 years, when the army quota was not increased in the Union Budget
 pakistan sarkaar ke is faisle se bajva kii fouj to naaraaz he hi, kaarobaari bhi ukhd gaye hai
 That is why Army Chief Qamar Bajwa, using his powers, took command and to understand the difficulties of the businessmen, he himself arrived to meet in a uniform-suit suit-boot

 ) On July 25, Salman Khan was acquitted in the Chinkara case
 adaalat ne kaha ki is maamle main gavaah harish dulani kabhi court aayaa nahin
 Therefore, the evidence is left with the circumstances of the court and they are insufficient, hence Salman Khan is acquitted
 do din tak log jis gavaah kii baat kar rahe the wo aa gaya he
 The verdict has also arrived, due to which the witness acquitted Salman Khan has also arrived
 harish dulani inkaa naam he
 They say that they did not bear witness
 adaalat kaa kahana he ki samman jari kiye gaye magar ye aae hi nahin
 On Wednesday evening, Harish Dulani came on NDTV with our colleague Harsha Kumari Singh and Jodhpur colleague Arun Harsh as an example
 wo misaal ye ki hamaari jaanch agenciyaan apane sabooton ko jutaney main adaalaton ko bhi chakma de sakati hai
 The witness who was said to be missing is now present in front of you
 tippaniyan Harish Dulani has demanded protection for himself through NDTV India
 unka kahana he ki hai profile cese ke kaaran unki jaan ko khatra he
 Harish Dulani is the lone witness in the Salman Khan case
 ve us car ke driver the, jisase salmaan khan shikaar karne gaye
 After this incident, the life of Harish Dulani changed and the destination of Salman Khan too
 wo begunaahi ke faisle tak pahunch gaye or harish dulani apni gavaahi ke liye tarasate rahe
 Now the question arises from these also, why did they not come to the court when the court issued summons
 kyon inhone salmaan khan ke vakeelon ke sawaalon kaa saamana kiya
 His statement of 164 before the magistrate was a strong evidence, but it has been described as suspicious and exaggerated
 salmaan khan par aarope tha ki ek film kii shooting ke dauraan wo jodhpur ke paas bhavad main the or 26 sitambar, 1998 ko ek chinkaara kaa shikaar kiya
 Two days later, on 28 September 1998, another chinkara was shot dead at a horse farm in Jodhpur
 1 aktubar, 1998 ko salmaan khan par kaale hiran ke shikaar kaa bhi aarope laga
 Salman Khan was also arrested for hunting black deer and was released on bail 5 days later
 nichali adaalat main in donon maamalon main 1 saal or 5 saal kii sazaa salmaan ko sunai gai, lekin 18 saal baad salmaan khan chinkaara shikaar ke sabhi maamalon se bari ho gaye
 The Rajasthan government has said that it will first read the court's decision and then consider an appeal in the Supreme Court
 harish dulani ne enditivi india ke zariye apane liye suraksha kii maang kii he
 He says that his life is threatened due to the high profile case
 harish dulani salmaan khan cese ke akele gavaah hai
 He was the driver of the car from which Salman Khan went hunting
 is ghatana ke baar harish dulani kii zindagi badal gai or salmaan khan kii manzil bhi
 He reached the verdict of innocence and Harish Dulani yearned for his testimony
 ab inase bhi sawaal to banataa he ki jab court ne samman jari kiye to ye court main kyon nahin aae
 Why did he face the questions of Salman Khan's lawyers
 magistrate ke saamne inkaa 164 kaa bayaan ek majboot sakshya tha, magar use sandigdh or badha chadhaakar diya gaya bayaan bataaya gaya he
 Salman Khan was accused of shooting a film at Bhawad near Jodhpur and hunting a chinkara on September 26, 1998
 uske do din baad, 28 sitambar 1998 ko jodhpur ke ghoda farm main ek duusare chinkaara ko maar giraaya
 On 1 October 1998, Salman Khan was also accused of hunting black deer
 salmaan khan ko kaale hiran ke shikaar ke aarope main giraftaar bhi kiya gaya or 5 din baad zamaanat par reeha kar diya gaya
 Salman was sentenced to 1 year and 5 years in both these cases in the lower court, but after 18 years, Salman Khan was acquitted of all cases of chinkara poaching
 rajasthan sarkaar ne kaha he ki pehle wo court ke faisle ko padhegi phir supreme court main apil kaa vichaar karegi
