 kisi ko nahin pataa ki uski jindagi kab badal jaae
 There comes a time in everyone's life when they are in a very good condition and suddenly the wheel of life rotates such that they cannot even get food for a time
 yahi vakt hota haijab ek shaks, dusron se madad kii guhaar lagaataa he
 Many times our families come forward for help in such circumstances and otherwise they have to take support from unknown people
 nottingham main ek 59 saal kaa shaks jo pehle boot factory main kaam karata tha, apni jindagi ke bahut mushkil halaaton se guzar rahaa tha
 The man had nothing to eat and was forced to stay in minimal clothing during cold weather
 wiliam naam ke is shaks ne apni pareshaani ko dekhte hue aakhir main tay kiya ki wo apane ghar ke baahar ek notice lagayegaa or logon se madad karne ke liye kahegaa
 According to The Mirror, William placed a notice at the gate of his home garden seeking help from people
 apane notice main wiliam ne likhaa, ''mere paas khaane ke liye kuch nahin he, mere ghar main bijli bhi nahin he
 
 
 If you can help me in any way, i will be grateful to you ''
 iske baad wiliam kii madad ke liye nottingham kaa ek bijnesaman craig crockerd aage aayaa
 Let me tell you, Craig runs a "christmas campaign" every year and asks people to donate food, toys and furniture etc
 craig crockerd, wiliam ke ghar se bas 10 minute kii duuri par rahata he or jab usne yah notice dekha to usne wiliam se milane kaa faisla kiya
 Craig Crawford said, "when he arrived at William's house, he felt colder outside than there
" vah keval ek kot, topi or gloves pahan kar baitha hua tha
 Craig further stated, "william had not eaten properly for the last 4 days and was just living with a cake"
 craig ne kaha, ''agar somvaar tak yahaan koi nahin aata to vah shaayad hi batch paata''
 "this notice of William saved his life," Craig said
 craig ne aage kaha, ''kuch hi ghanton main maine anya logon kii madad se wiliam ke liye kaaphi sara khaanaa or paisa juta liya tha
 He was in a very difficult situation ''
 craig ne bataaya, ''wiliam pichley kaaphi vakt se apane ghar kaa saamaan bech kar apane liye khaanaa juta rahaa tha lekin ab uske paas kuch bechney ke liye nahin tha
 Because of this he put a notice of help outside his house ''
 craig crockerd ne wiliam kii madad ke liye fasebuk par bhi logon se donneton ke liye kaha, taaki vah ek baar phir apane pairon par khadaa ho sake
 And through Facebook, Craig helped William to £ 2,500 (about 2
 35 lakh) rupee jod liye
 After the help from the people, William said, "I had put a notice on the door of my house a few days ago thinking that anyone who sees it will probably give me something to eat but you all got help
 i want to thank you for that

 are bhai tivi or akhbaar ke zariye jab desh ko janenge to itnaa hi janenge jo aap jaanate rahe hai
 There was also the same thing in the social media that was spilled in the media
 sab sarkas ke maut ke kuen main bike gogiyaan rahe the
 Some were saying the same thing in a survey and some in debates
 tippaniyan It is fine even ab bricsit ho gaya he to is par hazaron kii sankhya main vishleshan chap rahe hai
 Articles have been printed with so much angle that i am disturbed while reading
 ghatana se badi ghatana is par chape lekhon ke bhandar hai
 i have never heard such a big project to make people sing, so i want to read all the articles
 iske liye mujhe teen maheene kaa vakt chahie
 Brother people have written so much that it will take time till Chhath Puja
 par main teen maheene main brexit kaa dose puraa kar luungaa
 So, you can consider my 'leave Application' and provide a holiday
 aapkaa 'rimen' ravish Kumar mujhe teen maheene kaa avkaash chahie
 i am not using the word 'leave' or else you will start to understand that i have come under the influence of phobias and false propaganda
 jabase britain main 'live' jeeta he tab se 'rimen' vaale log 'live' waalon ko bhala bura kah rahe hai
 'leave' supporters are being considered as dumb and ugly
 isliye maine avkaash shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 The decision that Britain has taken to break away from the European Union is called Brexit
 main kyon teen maheene kaa avkaash chahta hum? main kai dinon se duniya ko samajhane kaa prayaas kar rahaa tha ki puraane model kaa hawaii jahaaz lekar netaa yahaan vahaan ud rahe hai, kuch ho nahin rahaa
 On the contrary, many economic and diplomatic clubs have become
 ab theke lene kii hode main desh bhi is tarah se shaamil hone lage hai ki mujhe ashanka he ki ve mulk ke naam main construction limited na jod len
 Not much, it is understood that since 2008, these leaders have blown how much oil, due to this, through TV, they themselves became great and world heroes, but the economic situation did not improve
 isamen kamaal yah he ki koi is aarthik vyavastha par sawalia nishaan nahin lagaana chahta
 No one is telling why the gardens of the economy did not come out after eight years of effort
 bachapan main main jab kamazor vidhyaarthee tha to bag main sari kitaaben lekar chalata tha
 My neighbor uncle said that the student's bag is always heavy

 Well, the aim of this letter is to ask for leave
 arthvyavastha par lacture dekar nobel puraskaar praapt karnaa nahin he
 Twenty years have passed while wandering in Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Sonipat, then this Hindi journalist has awakened his desire to be a global citizen
 main apane bheetar sanchit uttar bharat ke tamaam anubhavon se azaad hona chahta hum
 Till when will i know and tell the same thing in every election
 laga ki nae nae vishyon or bhugol kii taraf kadam badha kar dekhen ki kya vahaan duniya kuch alag he
 New information was thrilling to me
 sab kuch thik thaak hi chal rahaa tha ki brexit ho gaya
 The way the gravitational force of the Indian media is in Delhi, the same way that the Brit media is in London
 bharat se kisi ne vahaan jaakar britain ke badalte samaaj ko samajhane kaa prayaas nahin kiya
 Britons did the same, instead of talking to people, they started playing survey surveys
 vahaan ke fatichar media kaa jo haal he vahi yahaan ke media kaa he
 In India, people have understood Britain in two days through Independent, Guardian, Daily Mail, Telegraph, New Yorker, i TV, BBC, CNN and have started writing articles in Indian newspapers
 do din se koi bhartiya akhbaar hi nahin pard rahaa he ! While no one knew what was going to happen before Brexit took place
 ho gaya to yahaan vahaan kaa media hone waalon ke samarthakon ko hi gariyaa rahaa he
 In whose interest is the media standing up against the citizens
 bolta kyon nahin ki chavalis lakh rupee kaa qarza lekar koi graduate banegaa to baaki kai log aise bhi honge jo graduate nahin banenge
 Why would the poor talk like Cambridges when they did not get Oxford
 bataao na bhai ki vahaan kam padhe likhe log kyon hai
 If Modi fails tomorrow then what is the fault of the voter in this? uskaa faisalaa kaise galat he
 In the same way, how is a poor and less educated voter who votes for the British is guilty
 landan kaa media kah rahaa he ki log bahekaave main aa gaye
 Hey so what were you guys doing? Were you writing against this game of political corporate and media against which people were becoming there? media kaa bhi charitra cartil club kii tarah hota ja rahaa he
 The way writers have become active around the world, the same way those who share on social media have become active
 kabhi koi gardian kaa lekh thel de rahaa he to kabhi wox dot com or medium kaa
 We trust the media there as much as our own media
 madia ankhen band kar likhata he or ham log ankhen band kar pard lete hai
 Sir, the media there did not know that the 'leave' was going to win
 wo 'rimen' kii ummiden paros rahaa tha
 We are reading the analysis of that media
 padhe ja rahe hai phir yahaan ke akhabaaron main likhe ja rahe hai
 Now everyone has started reading and writing that the UK that i have awakened is not the UK i knew
 jaanane waalon ne samajha tha ki nayaa jaanane kii zarurat nahin he
 Questions on the actions of the parties between which they remain shuttle corks have almost ceased
 raajnneetik dal 'cartil' kaa cocktail pi rahe hai
 One must see that the time has come for the end of parties over fifteen years of age worldwide
 inamen kuch bachaa nahin he
 The new leader and strong leader's tantrums are proving to be worthless
 jaankaar kulinon kii nishtha logon ke prati kam in dalon ke prati zyaada ho gai he
 Instead of calling the people there as sophistic and blind nationalist, they should be called rich and poor
 corporate kaa vistaar galat nahin he lekin janata ko bazarwaad kaa pahaada rataakar inhen sabsidi dena kaise thik he
 In India, the loan of millions of crores was taken away by the corporate, no one got angry
 iske baad bhi netaa log mahaan bane hue hai
 The tweetless Indian farmer is committing suicide and does not even have permanent teachers in government schools
 iske bina bhi jidipi taraqqi kar rahi he
 Sycophancy is at its peak
 to aap bataaiye ki jo is system se baahar he wo kya karen
 What the system gave him was that he used to cut bread and mango slices with a fork knife on the dinner table
 kya landan or bharat ke jaankaar in logon kii pidaa jaanate hai jo kapaar dhun rahe hai ki yah wo landan nahin jise main jaanata tha
 Bogus nationalism on social media is not a mirror of any country
 export nahin jaanate honge us landan ko lekin landan kaa garib mazdoor unako jaan gaya hoga
 Experts can live without pension and cheap hospital, how will common people live
 bharat main saansad vidhayak, pradhanmantri or mukhyamantri tak ko pension he lekin karmchaaree ko nahin
 The day people understand what they will do on that day
 export bataa den ki unhen kya karnaa chahie
 Therefore Londoners are shocked

 Everything was going well that Brexit was done
 jis tarah se bhartiya media kaa gurutvkarshan bal dilli main hota he usee tarah se brit media kaa landan main hota he
 No one from India went there and tried to understand the changing society of Britain
 britain waalon ne bhi yahi kiya, logon se baat karne ke bajaae survey survey khilne lage
 The situation of the future media there is the same with the media here
 bharat main saare log indipentand, gardian, daily mail, telegraph, new yarker, ai tivi, bibisi, sienen ke zariye britain ko do din main samaj gaye hai or bharat ke akhabaaron main lekh likhane lage hai
 No Indian newspaper has been read since two days! jabaki brexit hone se pehle kisi ko pataa nahin tha ki kya hone vaala he
 If done, then the supporters of those who have media there have been garrisoned
 media kiske hit main nagarikon ke virodh main khadaa ho rahaa he
 Why don't you say that if someone becomes a graduate by taking a loan of forty-four lakh rupees, then there will be many others who will not become graduates
 jab garibon ko oxford nahin mila to ve kyon cambries kii tarah baat karenge
 Don't tell me why there are less educated people there
 kal agar modi fel ho jaaen to isamen matadaata kii kya galati he
 How is his decision wrong? usee tarah se bricsit ko vot karne vaale garib or kam padhe likhe matadaata kaise doshi he
 The media in London is saying that people have been misled
 are to aap log kya kar rahe the? kya aap raajnneetik corporate or media ke is khel ke khilaaf likh rahe the jiske khilaaf vahaan ke log hote ja rahe the
 The character of the media is also becoming like a cartel club
 duniya bhar main jis tarah se likhane vaale sakriy ho gaye hai usee tarah se soshal media par share karne vaale sakriy ho gaye hai
 Sometimes someone is pushing the article of Guardian and sometimes of Vox
com and Medium
 ham log vahaan kii media par apane yahaan kii media jitna hi bharosa karte hai
 Madia writes with closed eyes and we read with closed eyes
 bataaiye sar vahaan ke media ko pataa hi nahin chalaa ki 'live' jeetne vaala he
 He was serving the hopes of 'remain'
 ham us media ke vishleshan ko padhe ja rahe hai
 They are being read and then written in the newspapers here
 ab sab padhakar likhane lage hai ki main jis britain main jaagaa hum, wo vah britain nahin jise main jaanata tha
 Those who knew knew that there is no need to know new
 jin dalon ke bich ve shatal cork bane hue hai unki karatuuton par sawaal lagbhag band ho gaye hai
 Political parties are drinking a cocktail of 'cartels'
 kisi ko dekhnaa chahie ki duniya bhar main pandrah saal se adhik umr ke dalon kii samaapti kaa samay aa gaya he
 There is nothing left in them
 nayaa netaa or majboot netaa ke tatpujia tark bekaar sabit ho rahe hai
 The loyalty of the knowledgeable nobles is less towards the people and more towards these parties
 vahaan ke logon ko kutarki or andh rashtravaadi bataane kii jagah amir or garib kaha janaa chahie
 Corporate expansion is not wrong, but how is it okay to subsidize the public by making them run the gamut of marketism
 bharat main lakhon karodo kaa qarza corporate ne pachaa liya kisi ko gussa tak nahin aayaa
 Even after this, the leaders remain great
 twitorviheen bhartiya kisaan aatmahatya kar rahaa he or sarkari skulon main sthaayee shikshak tak nahin hai
 Even without this, GDP is progressing
 chatukaarita charam par hai
 So tell me what to do outside the system
 use system ne kya diya ki khaane kii mez par kanta churi se bread or aam katare
 Do the people of London and India know the pain of these people who are tuning in that this is not the London i knew
 soshal media kaa bogus rashtrawaad kisi mulk kaa aaina nahin hota
 Experts may not know that London, but the poor laborers of London may have known them
 bina pension or saste aspataal ke export ji sakate hai, aam log kaise ji lenge
 In India, mps, mlas, Prime Ministers and even the Chief Minister have pension but not the employee
 jis din log samajhenge us din ve kya karenge
 Tell the experts what they should do
 isliye landan vaale jaankaar sadame main hai
 Brother brothers like him are in shock in India

 Hey brother, when you know the country through TV and newspaper, you will know only that much you have known
 vahaan ke soshal media main bhi vahi sab jhalka jo media main chhalkaa tha
 All were bike goggles in the circus's death well
 ek hi baat ko koi survey main kah rahaa tha to koi dibet main 
 The comments yahaan tak to thik he
 Now that it has been classified, thousands of analyzes are being published on it
 itane angel se lekh chape hai ki main padhate padhate pareshaan hum
 Larger than the incident are the repositories of articles printed on it
 logon ko hi gariyaane kaa itnaa bada project maine kabhi nahin suna isliye main saare lekh padhanaa chahta hum
 For this i need three months time
 bhai logon ne itnaa likh diya he ki chhath puja tak ko time lag hi jayega
 But i will complete the dose of Brexit in three months
 isliye aap mere 'live aplication' par vichaar karen or avkaash pradaan karen
 Your 'remain' raveesh kumaar The way the gravitational force of the Indian media is in Delhi, the same way that the Brit media is in London

 The first reported news about the AN-32 aircraft of the Indian Air Force has been missing since the last eight days
 haalanki shuruuaati khabar acchhee nahin he
 Because the news has not come from the plane but some pieces of missing plane debris have been seen
 is vimaan main aath kru member samet kul 13 log savaar the
 By the way, let us tell you that the AN32 aircraft has been mysterious since the beginning
 isse pehle do baar enen -32 aasmaan main gaayab ho chukaa he
 And till date his clue has not been found
 25 march 1986ek AN-32 vimaan ne oman, muscat se jamnagar, gujarat ke liye udaan bhari
 The aircraft had 4 crew members and 3 passengers
 lekin udaan ke dauraan hi achaanak wo vimaan arab sagar se laapata ho gaya
 Which was not known
 22 july 2016us din bhi ek AN-32 vimaan ne chennai se port blair ke liye udaan bhari
 The aircraft had 6 crew members and 23 passengers
 lekin achaanak udaan ke dauraan bengal kii khadi ke upar vimaan laapata ho gaya
 He was searched a lot
 magar kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 On June 3, 2019, Indian Air Force transport aircraft aircraft AN-32 flew from Jorhat in Assam to Mechuka in Arunachal Pradesh, China
 vimaan main 8 kru member or 5 paisanger savaar the
 But shortly after takeoff, the AN-32 lost contact with ATC
 naa radar par vimaan kii koi lokation mili or naa hi vayusena uskaa kuch suraag laga pai
 The plane went missing from the Chinese border area in Arunachal Pradesh
 isliye shaq china par bhi gaharaa rahaa tha
 But India did not want to make any statement without coming to a firm conclusion
 achaanak vimaan ke gaayab ho jane kii do vajah hi ho sakati thim
 It was either pointing towards a conspiracy or towards an accident
 11 june 2019kareeb 9 din kii mashkkar bhari talash ke baad een-32 kaa suraag laga
 But the news that came was disappointing
 bhartiya vaayu sena ne 13 logon ke saath laapata vimaan een-32 ke malbe kaa koi tukdaa baraamad hone kii baat kahi
 This part of the debris was found in Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh
 haalanki vimaan par savaar payalat or adhikariyon ke bachane kii ummid kam hi he
 But in a statement issued by the Air Force, it has been said that they are searching for all the people boarding the plane
 airforce kii taraf se ek twit kiya gaya
 According to which the debris of the missing AN-32 aircraft has been seen 16 km from Lipo
 emai-17 helicopter ko search oparation ke dauraan kareeb 12 hajaar feet oonchai par tato ke uttar-purv main ye malba dikhaai diya he
 Search is on for the people on board the plane
 malbe kii khoj airforce ke choper emai 17 ne kii he
 The place where the wreckage of the plane has been found is Tato village in Siang district
 jise aap is nakshe main dekh sakate hain
 The question may arise in your mind, why did the Airforce take so long to find the AN-32
 to iskaa jawaab he ye ghaney jangal
 These are the same forests from which the aircraft's contact with ATC was severed
 lihaaza in jangalon se vimaan kaa suraag laga paanaa aasaan nahin tha
 3 June 2019, noon 12
 35 bajedopaher main een-32 ne assam ke jorhat airbase se udaan bhari thi or kareeb 25 minute baad hi dopaher 1 baje arunachal pradesh ke menchuka airfield ilaake se vimaan achaanak radar se gaayab ho gaya
 This area of menchuka Air Field in Arunachal is very close to the Chinese border
 atisi se sampark tuutane or radar se laapata hone ke kai ghant baad tak een-32 kaa koi suraag nahin mil rahaa tha
 The Indian Air Force aircraft AN-32 carried 8 crew members and 5 passengers
 yani kul 13 log is vimaan main the
 So the Indian Air Force did not want to leave any corps in finding the AN-32
 vayusena ne een-32 vimaan kii khoj ke liye ek sukhoi-30, si-130 special ops aircraft, een-32 aircraft, do emai-17 helicopter or sena ke do eechael helicopter lagaae gaye hai
 Not only this, it has also been announced to give Rs 5 lakh to those who give clues to the aircraft
 magar phir bhi vayusena ke vimaan een32 kii khabar nahin mil paa rahi thi
 Apart from this, several teams of the Air Force were constantly searching for aircraft from radar
 lekin aircraft se koi sampark nahin hua
 Nor was the debris of this aircraft found in any area
 phir aakhirkaar 11 june kii dopaher airforce ke choper emai 17 ko 12 hazaar feet kii oonchai par laapata een-32 vimaan kaa malba dikhaa
 The place where the plane debris has been found is Tato village in Siang district
 jo lipo se 16 kilometre dur he
 At present, many teams of Air Force and Local Police are trying to reach where the debris is seen

 More than clothes, jewelry, i was worried whether i would get as much leave from office as i needed
 
 
 disambar ke maheene main vaise bhi bahut saare event hote hai, aise main ek maheene kii chuttee maangana or phir mil janaa donon hi mere liye task the
 During this time, the girls have different types of tension about the kitchen, what they will cook in the other house, how they will cook
 
 
 jabaki mujhe sirf chhuttiyon kii tension thi
 i neither had the tension of round rotis nor the chicken curry
 
 
 us samay mere dimag main sirf chhuttiyaan chal rahi thim
 i joined the office a week after the wedding
 mujhe yaad he us din offis jane se pehle mujhe kitni taiyaari kerani padi thi
 i had chosen a nice dress
 phir usase maiching sandels or bag
 
 main jaanati thi ki log mujhe badhai dene aaengeore wo mujhe notice bhi karenge
 i had made only two cups of tea in the kitchen that day too and left for work quickly
 meri shaadi ko ab chaar saal ho chuke hai or mujhe ye kehane main koi sharmindagi nahin hoti he ki main ek domestically challenged mahila hum
 Yes, in these few years i have definitely learned some dishes that are made in five minutes
 meri daal aaj bhi pani-pani ho jaati he or roti banane kaa tension maine meri maid ke sir chhod diya he
 My house is not shining but does not remain dirty
 
 
 par sabase jaruri main khush hum
 Really happy lekin mujhe un logon kii soch par hansi aati he jo ek ladki ko uske do kaamon se hi jaj karte hai
 The first is how soon she is becoming a mother and the second is how many round roti she makes
 main in donon hi pahaluon par fail hum
 But that does not mean that i consider myself a failed wife
 
 
 galati se bhi nahin
 i share almost every bill in the house with my husband
 main uske saath samajhadaari or miningphul baaten karti hum
 i help her to see almost everything connected to the Internet by telling her, which saves her time
 kya itnaa kuch karne ke baavjood main buree bivi hi kahalaaungi?jab meri shaadi hui to meri maa ko bahut tension thi
 She used to get worried that i do not have any household work, then how will i pass
 par shaadi ke baad bhi mujhe khaanaa bananaa nahin aayaa
 Then when i took a year's break from the job, everyone advised me to learn cooking
 lekin maine kitaaben padhi
 
 
 Read a lot of books and get a lot of information
 kuch samay baad mere pati biimaar hue or logon ne ekbar phir mujh par dabaav bananaa shuru kar diya
 i listened to him to some extent, but during that time i used to sit with my husband for hours
 unase positive thots share karti thi
 i felt that he benefited a lot
 mujhe ye samaj nahin aata ki aakhir ham auraton ke gharelu kaam seekhney par itnaa jor kyon dete hai
 i can become a good wife by baking bread for my house and not earning the right bread
 main ab bhi kooking seekhney main interested nahin hum
 i can keep meds for her and i have
 mere paas ek hi jindagi he or main ise bilkul apane tareeke se jeena chaahati hum
 Instead of standing in the kitchen, making potato pea vegetables, sweat-soaked
 
 
 main ek domestically challenged bivi hum or main ise badalane ke mood main bhi nahin hum
 i want that when i am about to die, i remember these beautiful moments in life, not what i cooked for them
 rahi baat mere pati kii to bilkul unke saath ke bina main meri jindagi kabhi nahin ji paati

 anusuchit jati or janajati kanoon (SC / ST act) me badlaav ko lekar supreme court ke faisle ke baad jis tarah dalit samudaay ne is maheene ke shuru main sadakon par utar kar aakrosh jataayaa, phir ek hafte baad bihar main bhi kuch jagahon par aarakshan virodhiyon ne aarakshan ko lekar gusse kaa izhaar kiya, ye maamla abhi surkhiyon se hataa bhi nahin tha ki kendriya mantri ram vilaas paswan ne ucch nyaaypalika main aarakshan kii maang kar daali
 The leader of the Lok Janshakti Party and Minister of Consumer Affairs in the Central Government, Paswanka says that due to the decisions of the court, the Scheduled Castes have had to face problems again and again and in the past there have been many times when the Constitution after the decisions of the court The decisions had to be changed by amending
 ramvilas paswan ke alaava ek or kendriya mantri upendra kushvaha bhi ucch nyaaypalika main aarakshan kii maang kar chuke hai
 Many times Dalits were not found by the Nyaspaswan, that the court had said that there could be no reservation in promotion after the Mandal Commission's decision, after which the constitution had to be amended
 unhone kaha ki wo nyaaypalika kaa bahut aadar karte hai, lekin iske saath yah baat bhi sach he ki kai bardalitonko nyaay nahin mil paaya
 For example, all the accused in the famous Laxmanpur Bathe murder case of Bihar were acquitted in which 58 people were murdered
 paswan ke mutabik chintaa kii baat yah he ki is vakt bhi supreme court main koidalitjaj nahin he aurahaicortmen bhi unki sankhya bahut kam he
 He said that there is a provision in Article 312 of the Constitution that if the Government wishes, the All India Judicial Services can be constituted and appoint judges through it
 paswan ne kaha ki agar aisa hoga to paardarshee tareeke se dalit virgon ke log bhi nyaaypalika main pahunch sakenge
 Paswan, however, did not give a direct answer to whether it is necessary that judges should also be Dalits to bring justice to the Dalits? But he insisted that the manner of appointment of judges should be changed and there should be reservation in it
 civil services kii tarah nyaayadhishon kii niyukti ke liye bhi jeudicial kamishan hi sahi tarika hoga
 Outraged by the decision of the court, the angry actor said that when KG Balakrishnan was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, he was not accused of any particular caste
 isi tarah raashtrapati ramnath kovind puure desh ke raashtrapati hai, lekin unke raashtrapati banane se daliton ke man main santushti kaa bhav jarur aayaa
 He said that the recent decision given by the Supreme Court regarding the Scheduled Castes is resentful in the minds of the people and the government has also filed a review petition against it
 paswan ne kaha ki ham logon ko yah ummid he ki court logon kii naaraazgi ko samajhate hue apane faisle par punarvichaar karegi
 But if it does not happen then the government will bring the ordinance and preparations are also being made for it
 china main ek jaj ne samalangik shaadi ke pehle maamle ge kapal ke khilaaf faisla sunaaya he

" '' Holi, the festival of colors, has only a few days left
 sabhi logon main holi ko lekar kaaphi utsaah he
 On this festival people play Holi in many different colors
 in rangon main maujuud chemical aapaki skin ke saath-saath aapke baalo ko bhi nuksaan pahunchaa sakate hai
 Some people even shy away from playing Holi for this fear
 lekin ham aapako khuch tips bataa rahe hai, jinaki madad se aap apane baalo ko holi ke chemical yukt rangon se damege hone se bachaa sakenge
 1
 holi khilne se pehle apane baalo ko scorf kii madad se dhak len
 This way the dry colors will avoid getting deposited in the roots of your hair
 scorf aajkal fishan main bhi he, to scorf pahanane se aap acchhee bhi dikhengi or aapke bal bhi surakshit rahenge
 2
 holi khilne se pehle skin kii tarah baalo main bhi tel lagaaein
 It is better that you massage your hair with oil before one night
 tel baalo par ek protective layer ke rup main kaam karata he, jisase aapke bal damege hone se batch jate hai
 3
 agar aapaki sensitive scalp he, to tel main neembu kaa ras milakar lagaaein
 This will not cause any infection in the scalp
 4
 The hair of men is short, so the color is easily removed from their hair
 lekin mahilaon ke lambey baalo ko holi ke rangon nuksaan pahunch saktaa he
 So instead of opening hair on Holi, women should keep them tied
 5
 Do not apply any type of hair accessories in your hair while playing Holi, as they can get tangled in the hair due to colors, due to which hair starts to break
 holi ke baad baalo se rang kaise nikaalen-1
 In Holi, never wash the colors in your hair with warm water
 hameshaa thande yaa normal pani se apane baalo ko dhoen
 2
 chemical shampoo ke bajaay kisi herbal shampoo kaa upyog karen
 Gently clean the hair dyes
 iske liye apni ungaliyon se apane sir kii maalish karen
 3
 alovera jail se apane baalo main maalish karen
 Wash hair after 10 to 15 minutes
 4
 Holi color makes hair very dry and lifeless
 baalo ko komal banane ke liye hair spa kara sakate hai

 yahi agar congress karti to use afjal guru ko swatantraaa senaanee maanane waalon ke saath ghar basaaya, aisa kaha jaataa
 But is Afzal Guru a terrorist or a freedom fighter now? "will accept tomorrow as Babri Masjid instead of Ram temple" Shiv Sena questioned the intention of the central government and said, "hindutva and nationalists are shocked by the central government's reversal on Kashmir issue

 sanyukt raashtra main purv avar mahasachiv rah chuke 54 varshiya tharur loksabhaa ke saansad hai

 The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development made it clear on Wednesday that it has not been decided to abolish the University Payment Commission (UGC)
 mantralay ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki ujisi ke purv adhyaksh hari gautam kii adhyakshata vaali samiti ne ucch shiksha sachiv ko apni report saunp di he, lekin isaki abhi jaanch honi he
 The clarification from the ministry came after the media reported that the Commission had failed to fulfill its responsibility and that its reorganization would be a useless exercise and hence the UGC Act would be amended
 mantralay ne buudhvaar ko kaha, 'ujisi ko khatm karne kii khabar galat or avaanchit he
 According to this, the HRD Ministry had constituted a committee equipped with experienced and reliable academics to recommend restructuring and strengthening the UGC for better performance in meeting the intended objective
 'mantralay ke mutabik, 'haalanki, koi bhi faisla nahin kiya gaya or kisi tarah ke faisle se pehle anushansa ko abhi samajhnaa or uskaa vishleshan aavashyak he

 On the same day, BJP MP Yogi Adityanath praised the 17th-century Ahom commander Lachit Budfukan as a Hindu great who drove out the Muslim invaders — Badfukan defeated the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's army in a naval battle at Brahmaputra

 Elections are going to be held in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Kerala next year and Assam is the only state where the BJP has a good chance of coming to power
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main party ne ab tak kii sabase zyada 14 main se saat siten jiti thim, tab se rajya main bijepi ke sitare lagaataar chamak rahe hai
 The party's 'mission 84' to get a two-thirds majority in Assam's 126-member assembly was based on the fact that the BJP was ahead in 69 assembly segments in the Lok Sabha elections
 party kii ummiden farvari, 2015 main or bad gayi jab bijepi ne 74 nagarpalika bordon or nagar samitiyon main se 38 jeet leen
 The party's seriousness about Assam is clearly visible, because within two weeks of the Bihar Assembly results, the party high command appointed Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal as the chairman of the Assam unit and head of the election campaign committee and Hemant Biswa Sarma Was made the convenor of the election committee
 sonoval ko apratyaksh rup se mukhyamantri pad ke ummidavaar ke rup main pesh karnaa iskaa sanket he ki party sthaneey chehre ko aage na rakhane kii bihar or dilli chunaav vaali galati nahin doharaana chaahati
 But he is intent on trying the polarization strategy once again
 iske peeche tark spasht he
 The 2011 census data released last year shows that the Muslim population in the state has reached 34 percent, the highest after Jammu and Kashmir
 is badhati jansankhya kii vajah bangladeshi musalamaanon kii kathith rup se avaidh ghuspaith bataai jaati he
 This has created fear among Hindus that in the coming days the number of Muslims will exceed them
 rajnatik sameekshak dilip chandan kehete hai, ''assam ke logon ke liye bangladeshi ghuspaith bhaavnaatmak mudda he
 These expatriates are predominantly Muslim, so the polarization agenda has become easier for the BJP
 ''is bhay ko badhaane ke peeche ol india united democratic front (eiudief) kaa utthan bhi he
 The party was formed in 2005, whose leader Maulana Badruddin Ajmal is seen as representing the interests of Bangladeshi refugees
 2011 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main 18 siton ke saath eiudief assam main duusari sabase badi party ban gai thi
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, she had won three seats, equal to the Congress seats, while in 2009 she got only one seat
 assam ke mukhyamantri tarun gogoi, jinhone ''yah badaruddin koun he'' kahkar eiudief kaa makhul udaaya tha, ab bijepi se muqabla karne ke liye chunaav se pehle ajmal ke saath gathbandhan karnaa chaahate hai
 And the party that is most desperate to see Congress and AIUDF together is BJP
 assam bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''assam main koi bhi hindu yah nahin chahta ki sarkaar main ajmal kii kisi tarah kii hissedari ho
 "actually, BJP and AIUDF are looking to benefit from each other
" eiudief ke ek netaa ne india today ko bataaya ki bijepi netaaon ke sampradayik bayanon se muslim voton ko ekajute karne main party ko madad milegi
 But it will not be easy for the BJP to run the government under the leadership of Sonowal
 isaki ek vajah yah he ki 53 varshiya sonoval ko gaiyr-asmi logon ke bich shaayad vyapak sweekruti nahin mil paaegi
 Chandan says, "so far his politics has revolved around local Assamese sentiments
 ''1999 main sonoval assam gana parishad (agypi) main shaamil ho gaye the or unhone 2004 main dibrugarh se loksabhaa kaa chunaav jeeta tha
 He was seen as a hero in 2005 after winning a lengthy legal battle in the Supreme Court and repealing the disputed Illegal Migrant (tribunal Decision) Act, 1983, often considered a shield for illegal migration of Bangladeshis
 lekin ve 2009 kaa aam chunaav haar gaye or 2011 main bijepi main shaamil ho gaye
 Despite winning the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Lakhimpur, many leaders of the state BJP consider him an outsider
 bijepi kii chunaav samiti ke ek sadsy kehete hai, ''nayak bataae jane ke baad bhi ve 2009 main chunaav kyon haar gaye the? ek netaa ke taur par unhone abhi apni kaabiliyat nahin sabit kii he
 "there is a lot of anger among the people of Assam that the Modi government exchanged land with Bangladesh
" pradesh bijepi ne iskaa virodh bhi kiya tha
 The public is also angry with the government's assurance that Hindu Bangladeshis will be given citizenship
 bijepi ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai ki apni khiski hui jameen waapas paane ke liye party hadabadi main kuch kadam uthaa sakati he, jinamein centre sarkaar kii ore se assam ke chah obisi samudaayon—moran, mutak, tai ahom, coach rajbongshis, sutiya or 36 chaay kshetra kii janajatiyon—ko anusuchit janajatiyon kii suchi main shaamil kiye jane kii ghoshnaa shaamil he
 If these communities get tribe status, the total number of tribes will be more than 40 percent of the population of Assam
 isse 126 siton vaali vidhansabha main asti ke liye 80 siten arakshit ho jaaengi
 This will marginalize parties like AIUDF
 yah vidambnaa hi he ki bijepi ke liye sabase badi chunauti vah sankhya hi lag rahi he, jiske kaaran party yah maanakar chal rahi he ki dhruvikaran kaa agenda rajya kaa chunaav jeetne main madadgaar hoga
 There are 53 seats in the state which have more than 25 percent Muslim population and 39 of them 35 percent are Muslim
 congress or eiudief ke haath milaane par in kshetron main bijepi kaa jeetna lagbhag asambhav ho jayega
 a senior Congress leader in Assam says, "any formal alliance can prove to be harmful, because it can unite Hindu votes against us
" '' yah sanket he ki congress eiudief ke saath anaupchaarik, gathjod kii hi koshish kar rahi he
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has refuted the statement of Congress President Shahul Gandhi in which he claimed that an SPG official told him that there is pressure from the Modi government to recruit officials elected by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in the SPG
 grih mantralay ne apane bayaan main kaha he ki rahul gandhi ne 22 sitambar ko ek kaarykram main tippanee kii thi ki pradhanmantri narendra modi dwaara niyukt SPG ke pramukh ko pad chhodana padaa tha kyonki unhonearesasadwara chune gaye SPG adhikariyon kii list ko sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 The ministry has said that former SPG director Vivek Srivastava, who came under the scanner after thorough investigation into the matter, denied that he had ever had any talk with Rahul Gandhi on the issue of leaving SPG
 gauratlab he ki 22 sitambar ko dilli main yojit shikshavidon ke ek sammelan main rahul gandhi ne kaha tha ki 2014 main jab modi satta main aae to unhone ek aise vyakti ko SPG kaa pramukh chunaa, jo kuch samay baad hi istipha dene ko majaboor ho gaya
 Rahul said that the SPG officer, sharing his compulsion, said that he had been given a list of the people of the Sangh and asked to recruit them
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke daawey kaa khandan karte huegrih mantralyaki taraf se kaha gaya he ki SPG ek peshewar sanstha he jo pradhanmantri, purv pradhanmantri or anya pariwaron jinakisurakshaki jimmedaari unhen di jaati he use gambhirtha se leti he
 This statement given by Rahul Gandhi is baseless, untrue and unfortunate

 Brittany Menord, a 29-year-old American woman suffering from brain cancer, finally finished her life on November 1
 iske liye unhone aatmahatya kaa rasta chunaa

 britaini menord ne tay kiya apni maut kaa dinbritni ne isse pehle ek video sandesh jari karke apane faisle se duniya ko waakif karaayaa tha, jiske baad maut ke adhikaar ko lekar chal rahe vivaad ne jor pakad liya
 Earlier this month, Britney made headlines when she released her video
 is video ke jariye unhone aatmahatya kii dhamkee di thi
 The video was widely discussed on social media and watched by millions of web users
 britaini ne apane sandesh main kaha tha, 'sabhi pyaare doston or pariwaron ko good boy, aaj ke din maine atmasamman ke saath maut ko chunane kaa faisla kar liya, is bhayanak brain cancer ne bahut kuch chin liya he
 He further wrote, 'this world is very beautiful, my teacher and friends have given me a lot
 maine hameshaa apane paas ek madad kaa haath paaya
 Bye
 sakaaratmak urja failaaen or aage badaye
 'menord got six months to live in January and he was told that his death would be very painful due to the dreaded cancer
 is dauraan britaini apane pati dan diaj ke saath pehle bachche ke bare main soch rahi thi, lekin unhone apana faisla badal liya
 It was only after her marriage to Diaz that Menord began to have constant complaints of headaches
 iske baad donon ne california se oregaanv jane kaa faisla kiya
 However, on Thursday, Brittany released a video stating that the already confirmed death may lead to a slight delay in the interview
 lekin yah der bahut choti thi, britaini kii kahani puri duniya main surkhiyaan bator rahi he
 People magazine from the US featured Britney on its cover page last week
 haalia hafton or maheenon ke dauraan britaini apane liye backet list banaati rahi ki marane se pehle wo kya karnaa chaahati he
 It also included a trip to the Grand Canyon
 deth vid diganity act of oregon ke tahat saal 1977 se lekar ab tak 750 log apane liye maut chun chuke hai
 
 
 
 aakhirkaar bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne loksabhaa chunaav 2014 ke liye amethi or raibareli sansadeey kshetron se apane ummidavaaron ke naamon kaa elaan kar diya
 
 
 From Amethi seat, TV actor and bjp's Rajya Sabha MP Smriti Irani will challenge Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, while Ajay Aggarwal's name has been decided to contest against Congress President Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli seat
 
 
 duusari ore, congress ne abhi tak banaras main narendra modi khilaaf apane ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan nahin kiya he, jabaki punjab kii amritsar seat par arun jetali kaa muqabla karne ke liye congress ne ek majboot ummidavaar purv mukhyamantri captain amarinder singh ko maidan main utaara he
 
 
 It is not new to field strong candidates against top leaders in elections, and this has happened many times
 
 
 iske peeche yah ranneeti bhi hoti he ki party ke sabase bade netaa ko uske chunaavashetra main hi gher diya jaae, taaki use baaki ilaakon main chunaav prachaar kaa vakt hi na mil sake
 
 
 Many times it has happened that the top leader has had to face the loss and all the political equations after the election have been lost
 
 
 apatkaal ke baad hue loksabhaa chunaav main rajanarayan ne tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ko raibareli se hi haraa diya tha
 
 
 In this way, he had also avenged his defeat in 1971
 
 
 gauratlab he ki isi haar ke khilaaf daayar rajanarayan kii yachika par elahabaad hoicourt ne 12 june, 1975 ko raibareli se indira gandhi ke nirvachan ko avaidh tehraate hue unke chunaav ladane par chah saal kii pabandi laga di thi, or isi ke baad kii ghatnaon ke chalate indira gandhi ne desh main apatkaal laga diya tha
 
 
 Rajnarayan's memories were refreshed by the way Arvind Kejriwal defeated Sheila Dixit in Delhi last year
 
 
 isi tarah varsh 1984 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhi gwalior se atal bihari vaajapeyi ko chunauti dene ke liye madhavrao sindhiya maidan main utre the
 
 
 The interesting thing was that the Congress had dodged the BJP by announcing Scindia's name against Vajpayee at the very last moment, and in this election, Scindia defeated Vajpayee by a huge vote and called the 'giant Killer', and this victory won the party
 Even in Scindia's height became very high
 
 
 varsh 1999 main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ko bhi bhaajapa ne isi tarah gherne kii koshish kii thi, or ratorat sushamaa swaraj ko karnataka kii bellari seat se utaarne kaa faisla kiya gaya tha
 
 
 Nobody heard about this
 
 
 aazaadee ke baad se congress ne yah seat kabhi nahin haari thi
 
 
 Sushma contested and campaigned in Kannada, and she lost to Sonia Gandhi
 
 
 magar sirf 13 dinon ke prachaar ke boote teen lakh 58 hazaar vot hasil kiye or apni ore sabakaa dhyaan khinchaa
 
 
 However, from these parameters, Ajay Aggarwal can not be called big names against Smriti Irani in Amethi and Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli in any case
 
 
 bhaajapa kii koshish raibareli main uma bharti ko maidan main utaarne kii thi, lekin uma iske liye taiyaar nahin huin
 
 
 In the BJP, he also considered contesting from both Jhansi and Rae Bareli seats, but later it was decided that fighting with two seats of Modi and other leaders, especially two seats of the same state, would send the wrong message, so Ajay Agarwal Ticketed to, who is a Supreme Court lawyer
 
 
 boforce, seedbluji, telgi or taj corndor jaise maamalon main ajay agarwal janhit yachikaayen daayar kar chuke hai, jabaki tejatarraar smriti irani party main narendra modi kii kareebi maani jaati hai
 
 
 The popularity of Smriti, who became famous from house to house by playing the role of 'tulsi' in the TV serial 'because Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi', was tried by the BJP in the last Lok Sabha election as well, and then she was in Chandni Chowk in Delhi Kapil was fielded against Sibal, but Smriti lost and was later sent to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat
 
 
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki bhaajapa ne rahul-sonia ke khilaaf baari-bharkam ummidavaar nahin utaare hai
 
 
 Perhaps in the hope that the Congress will do the same in Benaras
 
 
 lekin raajnneeti vah kshetra he, jahaan na sthapit dharanaen kaam karti hai, na hi prachlit siddhant
 
 
 The last arrow of the quiver is used to smash the opponent
 
 
 dekhnaa hoga ki congress kya karti he

 beete kuch dinon se hinduvadi sanghathan or muslim sanghathan ke logon ne bich baatcheet kaa silsilaa lagaataar jari tha

 On the other hand, if the convenor of the joint Hindu organization Mahavir Bhardwaj, the district administration had sought cooperation from all the organizations regarding Ramadan and Namazco's prayers and a memorandum was also submitted to the district administration
 is gyaapan main kaha gaya he ki sabhi dharmik sthalon se namaajiyon kii duuri takreeban 2 se 5 kilometre kii honi hi chahie
 Anywhere if there is already a mosque and no one should be allowed to offer Namaz at any place within 2 km radius of that mosque
 bataa den ki pichley do hafton se dakshinpanthi sanghathangudagaanv main jume kii namaajako 'baadhit' karne kii koshish karte hue aarope laga rahe hai ki kuch log jameen hadapney kii koshish kar rahe hai
 In the last two weeks, prayers were stopped in Wazirabad, Atul Kataria Chowk, Cyber park, Bakhtawar Chowk and South City areas, police said
 ab virodh kar rahe sanghathanon ne dharmik sthalon ke 2 kilometre ke daayre main khule main namaaj kii ijaajat nahin dene kii maang kii he
 He said, when you play international cricket for 13-14 years, it is difficult to maintain that level
 khaskar mere sharir ke saath, lekin maine recovery ke baad pichley do teen saal main kaaphi mehnat kii he

 maaikel hassi or suresh raina kii chaturipurn ballebaaji se chennai ne yahaan rajasthan par aath wicket kii aasaan jeet darj karke twanti-20 lig mukaable main apana vijay abhiyaan jari rakhaa
 Chennai presented a strong example of not only batting but also a return to bowling
 hassi (naabad 79) or raina (61) ke dilkash pradarshan se pehle chennai ke gendbaajon ne rajasthan ko acchhee shuruyaat kaa phayda nahin uthaane diya tha
 Earlier, despite Rahul Dravid's 66-run innings, Rajasthan could manage 147 runs for six wickets against Chennai here
 dravid or shen watasan (32) se mili acchhee shuruyaat se rajasthan ek samay bade score kii taraf bad rahaa tha lekin lagaataar wicket ganvaane ke kaaran vah antim das over main 61 ran hi jod paaya or is bich usne chah wicket ganvaaye
 Dravid was attracted to Rajasthan's innings
 unhone apni ardhashtakeey pari main 51 gend kheli tathaa das chauke lagaaye
 Albie Morkel and Shadab Jakati took two wickets each from Chennai
 rajasthan jab toss jitkar pehle ballebaaji ke liye utraa to dravid or watasan ne pehle wicket ke liye das over main 86 ran kii saajhedaari kii
 The highlight of this partnership was that Dravid, who was leading the innings, completely dominated the bowlers and Watson, known for his stormy attitude, continued to play the role of his colleague
 powerple ke chah over tak watasan ne gend ko seemaa rekha paar bhejne kaa jimmaa sambhaal rakhaa tha lekin iske baad dravid ne apane is austrailian saathi se aage nikalne main der nahin lagaayi
 Rajasthan, meanwhile, lost the first wicket in the form of Watson, who smacked a Jakati ball but the bowler converted it into a catch
 unhone apni pari main 26 gend kheli or paanch chauke lagaaye
 The first wicket was delayed and then the story started to revolve around the bowlers
 rajasthan lagaataar wicket ganvaane se baikfoot par aa gaya or 150 ran tak bhi nahin pahunch paaya
 The decision to send young batsman Ashok Maneria to number three did not prove to be right and he returned to the pavilion after scoring only two runs at the boundary line off Ashwin
 jakaati ne iske baad johaan botha (8) ko bhi dagout main bheja
 Dravid could not succeed in his intentions to send the ball across the boundary line by waving it in the air

 haalanki dhoni ne apane gloves se is nishaan ko hataane se saaf inkaar kar diya
 At the same time, the Indian Army has refused to consider the mark on Dhoni's gloves as a sacrifice badge

 This sign has a sacrifice written in Hindi

 The National Assembly, the lower house, has already approved this bill and it only needs the President's signature to take the form of law, which is a mere formality
 ‘don news’ ne khabar di he ki pakistan main rahane vaale hindu is vidheyak ko vyapak taur par sweekaar karte hai kyonki yah shaadi, shaadi ke panjikaran, alag hone or punarvivaah se sambandhit he
 The minimum age of marriage for both boys and girls has been fixed at 18 years
 is vidheyak kii madad se hindu mahilaayein ab apane vivaah kaa dastaveji saboot hasil kar sakengi
 This will be the first personal law for Pakistani Hindus which will be applicable in Punjab, Balochistan and Khabar Pakhtunkhwa provinces

 The bill was introduced in the Senate by Law Minister Zahid Hameed which was not opposed by anyone

 The Advocate has sought cancellation of Kumar's membership as per the Election Commission's 2002 order, according to which candidates have to give details of criminal cases filed against them in an affidavit along with nomination papers
 unhone daawa kiya ki bihar ke mukhyamantri ne varsh 2012 ko chhodkar varsh 2004 ke baad kabhi bhi apane khilaaf lambit maamle kii jaankaree nahin di

 According to information from a report, about 44-44 seats are left vacant in both the campuses
 is par ames nodel officer kaa kahana he ki deshbhar main lagaataar chaar counselling hone ke baavjood in siton ko nahi bharaa ja sakaa
 At the same time, a senior official said, 'usually 3 students are called for one seat in counseling but this year we had invited all qualified students for counseling but in spite of this the seats remain vacant
 'in sansthaanon main seat khaali rahane kii ahm vajah kharaab infrastracchar, faikalti, clinical expoger, hostel or hospital facility kii kami bataai ja rahi he
 Surprisingly, some students even say that they would prefer to get admission in AIIMS better than taking admission in Regional Medical College

 Angry with anger, ASI took Yasmin to her house and put kerosene on it and set it on fire
 is ghatana se buree tarah jali yasmine kii aspataal main maut ho gai
 The police first denied the incident in defense of their ASI, and when there was an uproar, the police first tried to call it normal assault and then suicide
 isi bich yasmine ke bhai ne uski maut se pehle mobile se uskaa bayaan record kar liya tha, jisamen usne bataaya ki police vaale ne hi use jinda jalaayaa
 Then the police now accepted the murder and arrested the accused ASI and registered a case of 302

 ’ Telecom companies have given clarification on this after instructing the government to accept documents other than Aadhaar for purchasing a new SIM card
 companiyon ne kaha he ki nayaa sim card kharidne ke liye aadhaar kii anivaaryta kabhi nahin thi, balki ham sirf sarkaar ke nirdeshaanusaar sim ko ri-veriphai karne ke liye kah rahe the
 The telecom companies said that Aadhaar was never necessary to get a new SIM card, but it was only for re-verification
 wo bhi sirf graahakon kii jaankaree pukhta karne ke liye
 Telecom companies said that a recent report, in which Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan said that Aadhaar is not necessary to get a new SIM
 unke is bayaan se ham khud uljhan main hai
 So far no direction has been given by the government in this matter
 bataa den ki mobile number ko aadhaar se link karne ko lekar supreme court kii taraf se fatkaar lagaae jane ke baad centre sarkaar ne bataaya tha ki usne telecom companiyon ko nayaa nirdesh jari kiya he
 According to this, now you will not have to give only Aadhaar to get a new SIM card
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ab aap aadhaar ke alaava anya dastavej dekar bhi nayaa sim card le sakate hai
 Actually, the government was constantly referring to the Supreme Court for linking the mobile number with Aadhaar, but in the last hearing, the Supreme Court reprimanded the government for this
 sarvocch adaalat ne kaha ki hamane kabhi bhi sim card ko aadhaar se link karne kaa nirdesh nahin diya tha

 In such a situation, the country wants to know from Rahul Gandhi whether you are English or Indian

 Australia's explosive opening batsman David Warner has become the first batsman to score 500 runs in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019
 vah is world cap main sabase adhik ran banane vaale ballebaaj bhi hai
 Warner achieved this by scoring 53 runs in the ongoing match with England at Lord's Stadium on Tuesday
 warner ne is world cap main do shatak or teen ardhashatak lagaae hai
 Warner has scored 500 runs in seven innings of seven matches
 unka sarvocch score 166 ran rahaa he or unka ausat 83
 It is 33
 warner ne ab tak kul 46 chauke or chah chakke lagaae hai
 Apart from Warner, his own team's Aaron Finch, Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan, India's Rohit Sharma, New Zealand captain Ken Williamson and England's Joe Root have scored two centuries each
 khatre main sachin kaa world recordbata den ki agar warner kaa yahi pradarshan jari rahaa to bahut sambhaavna he ki vah kisi ek world cap main sabase zyada ran banane vaale sachin tendulkar kaa 16 saal purana world record tod denge
 In the 2003 World Cup, Tendulkar scored 673 runs
 sachin kaa yah record todane se warner 173 ran dur hai
 If the Australian team plays the semi-finals, Warner will get three more matches
 vahiin, final samet australia ko chaar match kaa mauka mil saktaa he
 In such a situation, Warner can break Sachin's record
