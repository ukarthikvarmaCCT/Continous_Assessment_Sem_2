 or wo lav story he pakistan ke raashtrapati asif ali zaradaari ke iklaute bete bilaval ali bhutto or pakistan kii videsh mantri hina rabbaani khar kii
 Yes, the news is very hot, so hot that only and only this is being mentioned in social media
 kaha ja rahaa he ki bilaval ali bhutto hina ke ishk kii janziron main giraftaar ho chuke hai
 The heart of hina-bilawal's love has reached the world, and the hearts of two hearts are getting silent, but the sound of two heart beats is now heard
 pakistan main hukumat chalaa rahi pakistan pipuls party ke chairman bilaval ali bhutto or pakistani videsh mantri hina rabbaani khar ne kab or kaise ek duusare ke dilon main muhabbat ke darvaaze khol die, isaki bhanak kisi ko nahin lagi
 And when it came to know, it was not only political in Pakistan but also in the social corridors like earthquake
 muhabbat kii ye agan to pakistan main lagi he, lekin isaki aanch duniya tak pahunchi he, to bangladesh ke raste
 It has been reported from Bangladesh's Weekly Tabloid Blitz that Bilawal and Hina's love has reached the point where both of them do not want to retreat
 sab kuch qurbaan karne ko taiyaar bilaval or hinoulfat ke uljhe afasaanon ko sulajhane main to takhto-taj tak qurbaan ho jate hai
 You must have also heard how love asks for sacrifice and the love laughs and loses everything on it
 bilaval bhi hina kii muhabbat main is gaharaai tak utar chuke hai ki apni siyaasi takat tak ko qurbaan karne ke liye taiyaar hai
 The 23-year-old Bilawal has sunk into the blue eyes like the lake of Hina, 12 years older than himself, that he is ready to leave the party
 aag donon taraf se lagi he, isiilie ye bhi khabar he ki hina bhi apni muhabbat ko shaadi ke khubasurat mode par le jane ke liye videsh mantri kii kursi tak thukraa sakati hai
 It is even discussed that in order to become Bilawal's Dilruba, he is also ready to divorce his billionaire, Shauhar Feroz Gulzar
 koi nahin jaanata ki siyasat ke galiyaaron main uthte-baithte paravaan chadhe is ishk kaa anjaam kaa kya hoga
 But Hina is sure that Hina of Bilawal's love will adorn her palms
 or bilaval ko bhi lagata he ki unki ulfat kii aakhri manzil hina hi hai
 The Bangladeshi tabloid did not openly confirm Bilawal and Hina's love in Pakistan, but there is a lot of news
 do dilon main panpi is muhabbat kaa khulaasa kiya he ek bangladeshi vikali tablored ne
 According to this tabloid, Hina and Bilawal are not even listening to Asif Ali Zardari in front of their love
 bilaval bhutto zaradaari or hina rabbaani khar ke ishk kaa khulaasa jitna dilfareb he, utana hi sansanikhej bhi, kyonki ab is pyaar kii raah main diwaar banakar khadey hai pakistan ke raashtrapati or bilaval bhutto ke walid asif ali zaradaari
 Rebellion is also ready for Bilawal, the chairman of Bilawakpakistan People's Party, and Hina, a minister in the Pakistan People's Party government, is four years old
 lekin is dauraan donon kab ek-duusare ke kareeb aae or muhabbat kii gaharaaiyon main kab dub gaye kisi ko nahin pataa, or jab pataa chalaa he to kaha ye ja rahaa he ki bilaval apane ishk ko paravaan chadhaane ke liye baghaavat kii had tak aage bad chuke hai
 According to the newspaper, which revealed the love affair between Bilawal and Hina, Zardari felt a sense of love for his brother on 21 September 2011
 us din bilaval kaa berthde tha or hina rabbaani khar ne bilaval ko guladaste ke saath ek card bheja tha, jis par likhaa tha- hamaare rishte kii buniyaad dil kii gaharaaiyon main he or bahut jald ham ek ho jaaenge
 According to the news, Asif Ali Zardari was aware that Zardari was in awe of the news of love between his son and the foreign minister in his government
 khabar he ki unhone bilaval or hina ke mobile phone record khangalvaae to khulaasa hua ki ishk kii aag donon taraf lagi he
 Zardari tried to convince both of them in gestures
 zaradaari ne samajhaayaa ki shaadi-shuda or do bacchon kii maa hina se umr main 12 saal chote bilaval ke rishte kaa koi bhavishya nahin he, lekin ye baat naa to hina kii samaj main aayi, or naa hi bilaval ne apane abba kii ek suni
 According to reports, the Cold War between father and son had started in Pakistan's Rashtrapati Bhavan
 lekin is saal id ke din baat had se aage bad gai
 The Bangladesh newspaper claims that Hina sent Bilawal her handwritten message with a bouquet in the gift of Eid, which said, "we have waited a lot, now is the time to end our wait
" id mubarak
 'hina threatens to leave PPP' It is said that when Zardari got the news of this message of Hina, he immediately summoned Hina Rabbani Khar and listened fiercely
 zaradaari ne saaf-saaf kaha ki apane nadaan bete se hina kaa extra marital afaire unhen ratti bhar manjuuri nahin
 But by then Hina was in a mood of revolt
 akhbaar ke mutabik, hina ne jaradaari ko do took kah diya ki wo apane nijee maamle main kisi kii dakhsandaazi bardaasht nahin karengi
 Hina warned of leaving the Pakistan People's Party along with the post of minister
 hina or jaradaari ke bich apane pyaar par takaraar kii khabar bilaval ko mili, to unka paara bhi saatven aasmaan par pahunch gaya
 Bilawal, deeply in love with Hina, openly rebelled against her father
 pati se talaak maang rahi hai hinacharchaa he ki hina bhi bilaval kii humsafar banane kii raah par hai
 She is also willing to leave her two daughters for this, and is now seeking divorce from her husband Feroze Gulzar
 wo apane pati ke bijnes main apana share apni betiyon ke naam transfar karne par raji hai, basharte firoz gulzaar unhen aasaani se talaak de den
 It is also reported that if Hina got divorced, she too can go to foreign countries with Bilawal, calling the minister's chair and Pakistan's politics by-bye

 madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav main bhopal madhya se bijepi pratyaashee surendranath singh kii haar par bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey ne vivaadit bayaan diya he
 Vijayvargiya, who is often in the headlines for his statements, said that more than the defeat of Surendranath Singh, he is most sad that the beef eaters won in front of the nationalist forces
 bhopal main bijepi booth kaaryakarta sammelan main vijayawargeey ne kaha ki chunaav to bahut saare netaa haare hai, lekin mujhe surendranath singh kii haar kaa sabase zyada dukh he
 In fact, the target of Vijayvargiya was the winning Muslim MLA of Congress, Arif Masood
 bataa den ki bhopal madhya vidhansabha seat par bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ke surendra nath singh or congress ke aarif masood ke bich sidhaa muqabla tha
 In this seat, Arif Masood of Congress won the seat
 unhen 76647 vot mili the, jabaki surendranath singh ko 61,890 vot mili
 Earlier, Surendra Nath Singh had won the 2013 election
 unhone aarif masood ko haraaya tha
 In the 2018 assembly elections, Congress won the state by ending a 15-year drought
 230 sadasyon kii vidhansabha main congress kii 114 siton ke mukaable bijepi ne 109 siton par jeet darj kii thi

 masood kaa palatwarkailash vijayawargeey ke bayaan par bhopal madhya se congress vidhayak aarif masood kii pratikriya bhi saamne ai he
 Arif Masood said that about 60 percent of the voters in his constituency are Hindus, in such a situation, Kailash Vijayvargiya's statement is an insult to them all
 masood ne kailash vijayawargeey par palatwaar karte hue poocha ki unhen ye bataanaa chahie ki unhone kab or kis taarikh par lunch yaa dinar main bif khate hue dekha
 During this time, Masood said that he never ate beef
 priyanka ko lekar bhi vijayawargeey ne diya tha vivaadit bayaanaye koi pehla mauka nahin he ki vijayawargeey ne koi vivaadit bayaan diya ho
 Earlier, he had also given a controversial statement about the newly elected Priyanka Gandhi of the Congress
 vijayawargeey ne kaha ki kabhi koi congress netaa maang karata he ki karina kapur ko bhopal se loksabhaa chunaav ladvaya jaae, to kabhi indore se chunavi ummidavaari ko lekar salmaan khan ke naam par charchaa kii jaati he
 Similarly, Priyanka is brought into active Congress politics
 unhone kaha ki agle loksabhaa chunaav ke maidan main utaarne ke liye congress ke paas majboot netaa nahin hai
 So she wants to contest through such chocolatey faces
 agar congress main rahul ke netritv ke prati aatmavishvaas hota, to priyanka ko sakriy raajnneeti main nahin laayaa jaataa

 The sadhvi who wrote the letter wrote that for the first time inside the dera a second sadhvi told her that Baba Ram Rahim was calling her in her cave, she was not happy
 use laga ki bhagwaan khud use bula rahe hai
 But once he went to the cave, whatever form he saw of his Baba, after that his trust in God arose
 baba ram rahim balaatkaar ke iljaam main doshi qaraar die jane ke baad beshak jail pahunch gaye
 But this is not the only case against him

 Baba's two servants, Kuldeep alias Kala and Nirmal, were tasked with killing Ramachandra as a shooter
 ittefaq se kaala mauka-e-vaardaat par hi pakadaa gaya or baba kaa bhed khul gaya
 Ranjit Singh was the brother of one of the two sadhvis who opened a front against Kesranjit Singh Baba, who was murdered in connection with the same rape case
 sibiai ne is maamle kii bhi jaanch kii or is maamle kii bhi tamaam gavaahiyaan puri ho chuki hai or is maamle main bhi usee adaalat main 16 sitambar se bahes kii shuruyaat honi he

 twitor ke is kadam se naaraaz abhijit ne kaha ki twitor anti neshnal, anti hindu or yahaan tak ki anti modi soshal site he jo desh kii aawaaj ko dabaanaa chaahati he
 Abhijeet is currently in Europe and is surprised at the incident
 ek news agency se baat karte hue abhijit ne kaha ki twitor anti neshnal, anti indian army, anti modi, anti hindu site he jo sirf aatankwaadiyon ko saport karti he
 Or should i say that they are all Naxalites and Twitter is a jihadi
 abhijit ne kaha ki ham sirf gayak nahin hai balki desh kii aawaaj hai jo desh drohiyon ke khilaaf khulkar bolenge
 Significantly, after Abhijeet's Twitter account was suspended, Paresh Rawal has deleted his tweet

 aajtak
 in ko die gaye EXCLUSIVE bayaan main abhijit ne kaha- main abhi europe main hum or meraa twitor acount suspend kar diya gaya he
 The reason for this is Arundhati Roy
 vahiin JNU kaa group bhi is maamle main unke saath mila hua he
 Me and Paresh Rawal tweeted in response to their anti-india talks
 is vajah se aisa hua
 There has been an increase in support from Modi
 It is being told that before Paresh Rawal's comment, there was news on some Pakistani channels that Arundhati Roy had gone to Kashmir after the incident of tying a Kashmiri youth on a jeep and there he supported Pakistan
 Gave a statement
 jabaki arundhati kaa kahana he ki vah is bich kabhi kashmir gai hi nahin
 Abhijeet apologized for making controversial statements on the Salman verdict, saying that Arundhati has been in the news many times over views on issues like Kashmir and Naxalism
 vahiin paresh ke twit par unka kahana tha ki unhen is baat se koi fark nahin padataa ki unke bare main log kya kehete hai
 Let the writer Arundhati Roy get the Booker Prize and she is also a part of the Narmada Bachao Andolan
 ajaan vivaad main sonu nigam main sir mundyasonu nigam aae abhijit ke saport menis tippanee ke baad abhijit kaa twitor acount block hona sonu nigam ko raas nahin aayaa
 He wrote, 'did he really suspend Abhijeet's account? Why? In such a situation, 90 per cent of Twitter accounts should be closed for worse abuses, threats and fundamentalism
 dekhen sonu kaa twit -really? They suspended his account? Why? 90% of Twitter accounts then should be suspended too for worse fanaticism, Foul language & Threats!https: / / t

 - input IANS Former National Co-organization Minister Sunil Bansal of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has been appointed as the State General Secretary Organization of Uttar Pradesh BJP
 yah faisla dilli main sanghathan mantriyon kii baithak main shuukravaar ko liya gaya
 Bansal has been given this responsibility in place of Rakesh Jain
 mana ja rahaa he ki yah faisla rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) kii ichha par hua he
 By making Bansal the responsibility of the state general secretary organization, the Sangh has made it clear that it is not sure of the huge success in the Lok Sabha elections
 uski najar abhi uttar pradesh par tiki he
 He is understanding the adverse conditions of UP, hence after forming the government under Modi's leadership at the Center, now wants to convert the support from the people into the permanent power of the organization
 sangh chahta he ki modi effect kaa laabh uthaakar uttar pradesh main pakad va pahunch aisi majboot bana lee jaae, jisase yahaan bhi satta main pahunchane kii raah aasaan ho jaae
 That is why, even though there is still about three years left for the state assembly elections, it has started preparations with the appointment of Bansal
 sunil bansal ko loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan uttar pradesh main amit shah ke sahyogi ke rup main laayaa gaya tha
 Then there were such indications that through Bansal, the Sangh would pursue Mission Modi in UP
 bansal ne na sirf party ke lakhanu sthit mukhyalay main rukkar puri vyavastha sanbhali thi, balki jilon ke chunaav prabandhan par bhi safaltaapurvak najar rakhi thi
 After meeting the first criterion, the Sangh has indirectly handed over the reins of the BJP organization by making him the General Secretary Organization
 isi ke saath yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki vah soobe main bijepi kii sthiti se bahut santusht nahin he
 That is why he has made up his mind to tighten and change the organization through Bansal, who emerged as a skilled organizer in the Vidyarthi Parishad and as an aide to Amit Shah

 This is not a true story but a story taken from khushboo-e-kashmir, a short story collection by Manoj Sheeri, a police officer in Jammu and Kashmir
 kashmir main 1989 main algaavvaadi andolan bhadakne se pehle tak kashmiri panditon or musalamaanon ke bich jaise rishte the, unhen aadhaar banaakar likhi gai kahaniyon kaa sangrah he yah pustak
 The khushboo-e-kashmir Khanty is an account of the same in Urdu in the past two decades that Muslims and pundits have endured
 shirin bataate hai, ''maine panditon or musalamaanon ke dard ko dekha he jinhen roj apni pahchaan sabit kerani hoti thi
 "sheerin hails from a small village of the same name in Baramulla district
 kai duusare pariwaron kii tarah ve bhi jammu chale aae the
 a few years there he worked in a newspaper, later went to the police force
 philhal ve jammu-kashmir police ke pravaktaa pad par hai
 Another moving story of this collection of twelve stories is Hasrat Natamam
 65 saal ke pan
 Jawaharlal had his own apple orchard
 baad main ve aakar jammu ke mishrivala camp main rahane lage
 When he fell ill, there was a desire to eat apples in the hospital
 chupake se baahar nikle, fal vaale ne unhen chor samajhakar peet diya
 One of his old Muslim servants brings a basket of apples from his garden, by which time they have passed
 andhi maa naam kii kahani main shiri ne aatankwaad kii dhundh main maanviyata ke chehre ko ujagar kiya he
 They take readers to a Pandit locality in the Handwara area of kupwara, a frontier district where a blind, childless old widow has given shelter to a terrorist
 usne dariyaa paar karne main budhinga kii madad kii thi
 The terrorist described himself as a shopkeeper in Srinagar
 vahaan pehle din aatankwaadi ram or sita kii tasveeron par jami dhul ko ponchta he
 He also contributes to domestic work
 ek din police ke chaape main ghar se pistaul baraamad hoti he
 The woman asks the police to release the terrorist and the terrorist woman
 ant main police donon ko pagal bataakar paagalakhaane bhej detii he
 In every story, Sheeri is seen to be shunning the Kashmiriyat with a strong harmony between the two communities
 itane halchal bhare daur main yah pustak likhane kaa uddeshy shiri kaa itnaa hi tha ki ve hinduon or musalamaanon ke bich chote-chote rishton ko saamne laa saken
 Nitish broke ties with the Grand Alliance and joined hands with the BJP and holds power
 aise main congress ke liye apane vidhayakon ko bachaae rakhane kii badi chunauti he, lekin party ke bade netaaon kii isaki phikr nahin sata rahi hai
 However, after the separation from power, many Congress mlas woke up to a longing for power
 yahi vajah he ki congress MLA kii tut kii sambhaavna badi he or jald hi soobe main siyaasi uthal poothal ho sakati he
 Let us mention that the Congress returned to power in Bihar in 2015 after twenty years
 vah soobe kii satta ke singhaasana par bhale hi kabiz na rahi ho, lekin satta main saajheedaar jarur rahi he
 In such a situation, the Congress mlas got a chance to enjoy power after two decades
 lekin nitish ke bijepi se haath mila lene ke baad satta sukh secongressi vidhayakamaharoom ho gaye hai
 Actually, after the crushing defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Nitish Kumar, Lalu Yadav and Congress formed a grand alliance to face the BJP
 is mahagathbandhan kaa cheharaa nitish kumaar bane the
 Of the 243 seats in the state, Congress fought on 101 RJD, 101 ZU and 41 seats Congress
 sutron kii maane to nitish kumaar ne 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan apni party ke tikat baantne ke saath-saath congress ke tikat main hastakshep kiya tha
 He worked to get a dozen of his tickets from the Congress party
 unamem se kai vidhayak jeetne main kaamyaab bhi hui the
 In the current changed equation, Nitish Kumar is trying to strengthen himself further
 aise main unke nishane par vah congressi MLA main hai jinakon 2015 main unhone congress kii tikat dilaane main ahm bhoomika adaa kii thi
 That is why it is believed that there is going to be a tremendous breakdown in the Congress
 baqayda isaki bhoomika taiyaar ho chuki he or congress ke kareeb 10 vidhayak hai, jo bakaayaad nitish kumaar se lagaataar sampark main hai
 Congress upper caste mlas of the state are not even enjoying the Congress's love for the RJD
 sutron kii maane to party ke zyaadaatar savarna vidhayak bijepi main janaa chaahate hai, to vahiin ati pichde or mahadalit samudaay ke kai vidhayakon kaa rujhaan jadyu kii taraf jhukta najar aa rahaa he
 Actually, there is another reason for the breakdown of Congress mlas
 congress ke MLA ko argedike sang raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Whether it is a matter of ideology or a book of votes in the region
 congress ko rajya main 20 saal ke baad sarkaar chalaane kaa mauka mila tha, lekin kendriya netritv kaa tejasvi yadav par spasht nirnay nahin hone ke kaaran sarkaar haath se nikal gai
 Congressmen, who have tasted power for 20 months, do not like it
 congress netaaon kii sabase zyada naaraazgi party alaakaman kii chuppi ko lekar he
 Most local Congress leaders believe that in the case of Tejashwi Yadav, if the high command had decided to stay with Nitish Kumar, this day would not have been seen
 bihar kii satta se haath dhone ke baad inhen shikayaton kii vajah se congress netaa ab vikalp kii talash main jute gaye hai
 There are 27 Congress mlas in the state, so if the experts are to be believed, if the party breaks up in the coming days, one should not be surprised
 gauratlab he ki argedy or congress ke bich sambandh kaaphi puraane he, jo 1997 main seetaram kesari ke congress adhyaksh rahete hue shuru hui thi
 After this, Sonia Gandhi became Congress President in the year 1998 and during this time she got full support of Lalu Prasad Yadav
 vahiin chaara ghotaale main fanse lalu kii sarkaar jab sankat main ghiri, congress ne hi samarthan dekar use ubaara

 Ekta Kapoor angrily called the police
 ekta or tushaar ne hansate hue bataaya ki phir pita jitendra ne hastkshep kiya or maamle kaa niptaya tha

 Since the show is also a fun, fun and horror comedy, it had an entertaining story to shoot, so i agreed

 But once that set in, there was no looking back (literally!) 😄 It has been months since I've even needed a 'trim'
 So, during the @bazaarindia shoot when @mickeycontractor said that i needed one, my first thought was, “really??”
 Before i could react, he was all set - armed with an eyebrow scissor, ready to go at it! i couldn't stop smiling
 Never thought I’d get a makeover of sorts like this, but i guess it’s # mynewnormal

 Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mufti Muhammad Saeed hosted an Iftar feast
 lekin is party main centre kii ore se bijepi kaa koi bada cheharaa nahin aayaa
 It is interesting that Mufti Muhammad organized the event at Delhi's five-star Hotel Ashoka instead of Jammu and Kashmir
 kaha ja rahaa he ki srinagar tak siyaasi doston ko aane main shaayad dikkat hoti lihaaja dilli main hi iftaar kaa thikaana banaaya gaya
 Many leaders attended Mufti Muhammad's iftar party, but no big face of BJP became the pride of the program beyond expectations
 naa bijepi adhyaksh amit shah dikhe or naa hi kendriya mantrimandal kaa koi kaddavar naam najar aayaa
 Neither the Congress high command Sonia Gandhi nor the former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appeared
 haalanki sutron kii maane to nyotaa sabhi ko tha
 Jammu and Kashmir Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh definitely joined this Mufti party
 lekin bahut sambhav he ki bijepi kii ore se ye sandesh dene kii koshish kii gai he ki rajya main satta kaa gathbandhan patari par he
 However, the absence of any central level BJP leader is also indicating that he is not in agreement with Mufti Muhammad's policies towards separatists in the state
 koun-koun hue shamilsutron ke mutabik, pidipi sangrakshak said ne bijepi ke kai netaaon ko nimantran bheja tha
 Some leaders had already expressed their inability to join

 PDP mps Muzaffar Hussain Baig and Tariq Hamid Kara were also invited, but both were absent

 'let us tell you that RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary had attacked the BJP and said about the Kairana by-election, that Jinnah is not an issue here, sugarcane is the issue
 yogi ne kaha, 'sapa kii sarkaar ne dark jone ke naam par yahaan ke kisaanon kaa shoshan kiya
 Our government will not allow anyone to play with the feelings of the farmers here

 Tabassum is a candidate from RLD this time
 jayant choudhary ne unke prachaar ke dauraan kaha tha ki bijepi ganna kisaanon kii dikkaton kii bajaay jinna (aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay main) ke chitra ke bare main adhik chintit he
 In response to this, Yogi said that sugarcane farmers are his first priority, Jinnah later

 Lawyer for British citizen Christian Mitchell, a middleman in the agustawestland VVIP helicopter deal case, has pleaded for relief at the United Nations alleging harassment of his client

 Christian Mitchell is currently lodged in Tihar Jail
 chrishchiyan mishael ke vakil ne sanyukt raashtra main yachika dekar kaha he ki bharat or sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) kii sarkaar uske muvakkil mishael ko pareshaan kar rahi hai
 In the same petition, he has requested for the early release of Mitchell
 beete saal 4 disambar ko mishael ko yuai se bharat laayaa gaya tha
 In the petition, his lawyer has said that the investigating officers of India and the UAE are misbehaving and torturing Mitchell in the investigation of the agustawestland case
 apni shikaayat main vakil ne kaha he ki tihaad jail main mishael ko kaaphi buree dasha main rakhaa gaya he or jaanch adhikari mishael par raajnneeti se prerit managasaint bayaan dene kaa dabaav bana rahe hai
 However, sources told India Today that Mitchell was extradited from the UAE with strong evidence and all legal procedures were completed
 mishael 2013 main bharat chhod kar bhaag gaya tha
 After this, the investigating agencies asked Interpol and issued a red corner notice against him
 duusari ore bharat sarkaar ne in aaropon ko sire se nakaar diya he
 a high-level government source told India Today, "what his (mitchell) lawyer has claimed in the United Nations is completely wrong as Interpol issued a red corner notice only after examining all the papers
" yuai sarkaar ko do saal pehle pratyrpan kaa aagrah bhej diya tha
 The official also said that along with Mitchell's extradition to India, his lawyers and officials of the British High Commissioner were allowed to meet
 yahaan tak ki uske sabase kareebi rosemeri patriciy ko bhi milane diya gaya tha
 Sources in the Tihar Jail have also brushed aside Mitchell's allegations in a conversation with India Today and said that Mitchell was not kept with 45 detainees but was kept alone in view of security
 videsh main apane parijanon se baat karne ke liye use international phone kol karne kii bhi suvidha mili hui he
 Mitchell's interim bail plea in the agustawestland VVIP helicopter deal worth Rs 3,600 crore was recently rejected by a Delhi court
 mishael ne easter ke avasar par dharmik sabha main hissaa lene kii ichha jataai thi
 Special Judge Arvind Kumar dismissed his plea after opposing Mitchell's bail plea on behalf of the Enforcement Directorate (ED)
 mishael ke vakil aljo ke
 Joseph and Vishnu Shankar approached the court seeking bail

 Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi has told the government that Jamia Millia Islamia of Delhi is not a minority organization as it was established by an Act of Parliament
 rohtagi ne kuch hi din pehle ucchtam nyaayalay se kaha tha ki kanoon kaa uddeshy yah nahin tha ki aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay koi alpsankhyak vishvavidhyalay ho
 It is understood that the Attorney General in his legal opinion given to the Ministry of Human Resource Development has also referred to a judgment of the Supreme Court of 1967 stating that Aligarh Muslim University is technically not a minority institution and that is the principle of Jamia
 Milia also applies to Islamia
 maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ne is mudde par kanoonee raay ke liye kanoon mantralay se sampark kiya tha
 The Law Ministry then sought a legal opinion from Rohatgi
 rashtriya alpsankhyak shaikshik sanstha ayog (ensiemiai) ne kuch saal pehle jamiya milia islamia ko ek dharmik alpsankhyak sanstha ke rup main ghoshit kiya tha
 The comments is aadesh ke aadhaar par jamiya milia islamia ne anusuchit jati, anusuchit janajati or anya pichde virgon ke liye aarakshan khatm kar diya tha or prayek paathyakram main 50 pratishat siten muslim ummidavaaron ke liye niyat kar di thi
 Sources in the Law Ministry cited Article 7 of the Jamia Millia Islamia Act, 1988 stating that "the University shall be open to any gender and any race, caste, or class, and as a teacher or student It will not be valid for the university to apply the criteria of religious faith or profession to a person to be eligible for admission
 ’’ rohtagi ne isi hafte ucchtam nyaayalay se kaha tha ki sarkaar kii raay main aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay koi alpsankhyak vishvavidhyalay nahin he
 Rohatgi had told the Supreme Court just a few days ago that the purpose of the law was not that Aligarh Muslim University should be a minority university
 samajha jaataa he ki etorni general ne maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ko di gai apni kanoonee raay main 1967 ke ucchtam nyaayalay ke ek faisle kaa bhi zikr kiya he jisamen kaha gaya he ki takneekee taur par aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay koi alpsankhyak sanstha nahin he or yahi usul jamiya milia islamia par bhi lagu hota he
 The Ministry of Human Resource Development had approached the Law Ministry for a legal opinion on the issue
 iske baad kanoon mantralay ne rohtagi se kanoonee raay maangi thi
 The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) declared Jamia Millia Islamia as a religious minority institution a few years ago
 tippaniyan On the basis of this order, Jamia Millia Islamia abolished reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes and fixed 50 percent seats for Muslim candidates in each course
 kanoon mantralay ke sutron ne jamiya milia islamia adhinium, 1988 ke anuchhed 7 kaa hawala diya jisamen kaha gaya he ki ‘‘vishvavidhyalay kisi bhi ling or kisi bhi nasl, jati, yaa varg ke liye khulaa rahegaa, or kisi shikshak yaa chaatr ke rup main daakhile ke liye paatr banane ke liye kisi vyakti par dharmik aasthaa yaa peshey kii kasuti lagu karnaa vishvavidhyalay ke liye vaid nahin hoga

 The seat of the Samajwadi Party, the stronghold of the Jaswantnagar Mulayam family, said: If the membership goes, it will contest the by-election from Jaswantnagar itself
 Shivpal Singh Yadav, the national president of the progressive Samajwadi Party has announced to contest the by-election from Jaswantnagar seat
 darasal, shivpal kii vidhansabha sadsyta par talwaar latak rahi he, kyonki samaajawaadee party (sapa) ne sadsyta khatm karne kii maang kii he
 Now Shivpal said that he will contest elections from Jaswantnagar, whether SP or anyone else
 shivpal singh yadav ne kaha, 'jaswantnagar se mujhe koi chunaav main haraa nahin sakaa he
 The people of Jaswantnagar are with us
 agar meri sadsyta khatm hoti he to main jaswantnagar vidhansabha seat se chunaav laduunga, saamne samaajawaadee party kaa chaahe jo bhi cheharaa ho
 It is clear from Shivpal's announcement that now the battle of uncle and nephew has come at a new point

 The important thing is that Shivpal Yadav also announced that whatever candidate the Samajwadi Party brings in front of them, their victory will be theirs
 darasal, jaswantnagar seat mulaayam parivaar kii garh maani jaati he or aaj tak yah seat samaajawaadee party or parivaar ke kabje main hi rahi he ab jabaki party or parivaar donon tut chukaa he, aise main agar jaswantnagar seat par chunaav hota he to ladaai dilachasp hogi
 Akhilesh Yadav also said in a special conversation from today till today that his party has written to the Speaker of the Assembly regarding the membership of Shivpal Yadav and now the decision has to be taken by the Speaker

 After this, he realized that it is important to keep yourself very active in this career
 unhen filmein naa milane kaa ek kaaran ye bhi tha ki saradaaron ko bollywood main kaaphi steriotip kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The man wearing a turban for serious and dramatic characters does not fit the Bollywood-made pattern, but Manjot wants to break the perception and prove that the chieftains in the films are not just made for funny characters

 chaay pine se sardi-zukam jaisi bimaariyaan dur hoti hai ye to aapane suna hoga lekin kya aap jaanate hai ki pyaaj se bani chaay pine se kai badi bimaariyaan bhi dur hoti hai
 Yes, you heard right, drinking onion tea is beneficial for health and at the same time it is also very good in taste
 aaie jaane, pyaaj kichaay pine ke phydeor banane kaa tarika
 
 
 What do researchers say? According to researchers from the Journal of European Clinical Nutrition, onions contain an element called quercetin, which increases the activity of antioxidants in the blood
 iske alaava pyaaj kii chaay main vitamin si hota he jo sardi-zukam ke shuruaati lakshanon ko rokane kaa kaam karata he
 a pigment called quercetin present in onions prevents blood clotting, reducing the risk of hypertension
 research ke anusaarek adhyayan ke anusaar pyaaj main glucose pratikriya ko behatar karke insulin regitant ko badhaakartip-2 diabetesmein raahat dilaane main madad karata he
 Onion tea helps in destroying free radicals
 cancer main bhi phydemandahaal main ek adhyayan main ye paaya gaya he ki pyaaj kii chaay cancer cells ko badhane se rokatii he or ye colon cancer ko thik karne main bhi madadgaar he
 Onions have soluble fiber that helps keep the colon clean
 ye ghulansheel fibre twachaa or aant setoxin ko baahar nikaalkarcancer cells ko banane se rokte hai
 This way, onion tea will be prepared first by washing one onion and then boiling water and add onion pieces
 jab pani ubal jaae to usamen neembu kaa ras or green tii bag mila len
 Now filter it and mix honey as per your choice and enjoy healthy onion tea

 BLOCKBUSTER!— taran adarsh (@taran_adarsh)november 12, 2017 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley along with his colleague, Minister of State Jayant Sinha, is engaged in the final preparations for the budget to be presented later this month
 logon ko modi sarkaar ke isbajet se kaaphi ummidenhain or har varg ke log us ore dhyaan lagaae hue hai
 Let's try to know what 5 special things can happen in this budget
 1
 There is every possibility that in this budget, Jaitley will focus on the reform of direct taxes
 asia ke deshon main bharat aisa desh he jo sabase zyada tex vasuulata he
 Jaitley is paying attention to this and is going to make a prudent tax regime
 iskaa phayda sabhi ko hoga kyonki inakam tex kii daron main kami aegi
 It can be expected that Jaitley will reduce tax from Rs 50,000 to Rs one lakh
 lekin iske saath hi kuch chhuten milani band bhi ho sakati hai
 The reason behind giving income tax exemption is that the government wants the income of the people to increase so that they can spend more, which will give a boost to the manufacturing sector
 2
 PM Modi's dream is to lay a network of highways in the country
 iske liye jetali infrastracchar se judi pariyojnaon ke liye baari raashi kaa elaan karenge
 This will also benefit the public as the government will announce large-scale tax-free bonds to raise funds for these projects
 in baandon main paisa lagaakar aap tex main chhot to paaenge hi, acha byaaj bhi kama sakenge
 The government will also get a lot of money from these
 3
 The Government of India and the Railways have many such lands which are lying vacant
 sarkaar inhen lij par de sakati he or kuch nilaamee ke jariye bech bhi sakati he
 The government will get money from this, the public will be saved from tax
 4
 Taxes on tobacco products may increase, especially on bidis
 iske alaava prashaadhan main kaam main aane vaale manhage utpaadon par tex bad saktaa he
 Alcohol may be taxed further
 5
 The government may also announce the sale of shares of banks
 sarkari bainkon main sarkaar apana hissaa ghataakar 52 fisadi tak laane ke bare main ghoshnaa kar sakati he
 This will tighten the revenue deficit, banks will also be strong
 6
 In November, Arun Jaitley said that he was against subsidizing the rich
 isliye is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki rasoi gas main jo sabsidi milti he vah amiron ko nahin mil paaegi
 Probably the government will resort to total income for this
 yani logon kii aay ke mutabik hi unhen gas main sabsidi mil paaegi
 This will save the government a lot

 Rajasthan's Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot has claimed to have created a record of creating employment under the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Scheme ie MNREGA
 guuruuvaar ko pradesh ke vibhinn sthanon se jaipur pahunche manaregaa mazdooron ko indira gandhi panchayat raaj santhaan main sambodhit karte hue payalat ne daawa kiya ki pradesh kii congress sarkaar ne manaregaa ke tahat kaam dene main record kaayam kiya he
 He said that till December 2018 under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, 9 lakh people got employment daily under the MNREGA
 congress kii sarkaar aane ke baad aaj 32 lakh logon ko pratidin rojgaar uplabdh karaayaa ja rahaa he
 This is a record in itself
 upmukhyamantri ne kaha ki rajasthan behad kam jansankhya vaala rajya hone ke baavjood rojgaar paidaa karne ke maamle main desh main duusare sthaan par pahunch gaya he
 Sachin Pilot announced the expansion of MNREGA and said that separate provisions will be made for the elderly and differently abled
 isse bujurgon or divyangon ko rojgaar kii guarantee se vanchit nahin rahanaa hoga
 The pilot said on this occasion that to make MNREGA more productive, it will also be implemented in water harvesting and water harvesting works
 isse pradesh main pani kii samasya ko manaregaa ke jariye hal kiya ja sakegaa
 Pilot said that MNREGA was the dream project of the UPA government and we have brought it to a strong position in Rajasthan
 hamaari koshish hogi ki pradesh kaa koi bhi vyakti jo manaregaa ke maapdand par khara utarataa ho, vah iske laabh se vanchit na rah paae
 He said that a social audit will be conducted by an independent agency to address the shortcomings of MNREGA
 saath hi hi rajya main manaregaa karmiyon ko jodne ke liye kaam maango abhiyaan bhi jor-shor se shuru hoga
 Significantly, MNREGA was implemented during UPA One

 West Indies cricket team wicket-keeper batsman Dinesh Ramdin has apologized for making fun of legendary batsman Sir Vivian Richards after scoring a century on the fourth day of the third and final Test match against England on Sunday
 edbeston main ramdin ne jaise hi apana shatak puraa kiya uske baad unhone apane jeb se ek kaagaj kaa tukdaa nikaala, jis par english main likhaa tha, 'yaah viv tok naah'
 What does this mean Viva will say now? Ramdin, standing in the middle ground, showed this piece of paper in the direction of the media center, which was also focused by the cameraman of the broadcasting company
 richards ne trent brij test haarane ke baad ramdin kii kadi aalochana kii thi
 Ramdin said that he was deeply hurt by the remarks made by Richards
 yahi kaaran he ki shatak lagane ke baad vah bhavuk ho gaye
 Ramdin said, 'sir Viv had said something about me in the media and i felt that i had become a bit emotional
 main uttejnaa main yah sab kuch kar baitha'
 'he is a great West Indies player and i still respect him
 unke bayaan se mujhe thodi chot pahunchi thi, lekin maine kadi mehnat kii or maine apni ballebaaji se aalochakon ko galat tehraaya
 'it is noteworthy that Ramdin has returned to the team on the England tour

 According to ANI, the Indian Ambassador said, '2 leaders Howdy Modi is addressing the ceremony

 aayojakon ne bataaya ki 50 hajaar se zyada logon ne is samaaroh main shaamil hone ke liye registerd kiya he
 In this entire controversy, someone has emerged as the winner, it is Lalit Modi
 montinigro kii kubsuurati ne lalit modi kii is jeet main or bhi chaar chand laga diye hai
 If the Prime Minister could not speak for six days in the matter related to the person, then from the point of view of that person, then he is the officer of the last Attahas
 do do sarkaron ke daur main bhi lalit modi vijeta kii tarah muskura rahe hai
 No charges have been proved on him in any court, so he cannot be compared at all to any plush villain of films
 magar paanch saal se bharat aane se manaa kar rahe lalit modi ke saamne nayak chhodiye koi singhm yaa shinde jaisaa daaroga bhi nahin jo unke bindaas chehre par pal bhar ke liye khuf paidaa kar de
 They are living a king size life there and they are fighting like pawns with them here
 upie kii sarkaar ko chaar saal mila, endie kii sarkaar ke ek saal se zyaada ho gaye magar lalit modi bemauf hai
 If Lalit is innocent, at least justice is done so that the people who have taken innocent and innocent Lalit off the soil of Mother Bharati should file a case and be sent to jail
 yah bhi to koi nahin kahata
 Have you heard such a statement that wait in two months, Lalit Modi will be brought to the door of Enforcement Directorate and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence
 balki bijepi ke upaadhyaksh shyaam jaju ne nidhi kulapati ke kaarykram main kaha, 'lalit modi kanoon kii anumati lekar vahaan uplabdh hai
 Are available for ED
 bhagoda kise kaha jaataa he
 What is not available is called
 wo court kii anumati se uplabdh hai
 The ED has not complained that they are not available to us
 ab usko jaanch kahaan rahakar kerani he, kahaan nahin, kanoon usko isaki swatantraaa detaa he
 Shyam Jaju is the bjp's national vice president
 to kya modi sarkaar yah bhi maanati he ki lalit modi kanoon kii di hui swatantraaa ke tahat landan main hai
 It is not wrong for them to be there
 cricket kii duniya ke jaankaar thik hi kehete hai ki lalit modi par haath daalana aasaan nahin he
 a tweet from Lalit Modi leads to the resignation of a Congress minister, with a statement that Sushma as well as Vasundhara Raje fall under suspicion but does not challenge Lalit Modi
 likhte rahiye lalit niabandh magar unke lalit prabandh ke saamne sab feekaa
 The BJP broke its silence on the case of Vasundhara Raje
 dilli main party ke rashtriya pravaktaa sundhashu ne kaha ki vasundhara ji ne ye baat sweekaar kii he ki shri modi ji ke saath un logon ke nazadiiki paariwarik sambandh the
 He never denied this subject
 dastavezon kii pramanikta abhi tak satyapit nahin he
 Secondly, which is the subject of investment in the company of his son and BJP MP Mr
 Dushyant, then this is not a new topic
 ye saare tathy inakam tex ke ritern main or saansad kaa namakan bharte samay unke halafname main swatah spasht he
 So this thing is already in public cognizance
 yahaan tak ki is vishay ko ucch nyaayalay ke bhi sangyaan main laayaa gaya or usne use vichaarneey nahin mana tha
 You will ask Sanskrit and Hindi teacher whether familyism and family relations are same or different
 raajnneeti main parivaarwaad ek mudda he lekin paariwarik sambandh lagata he ki certificate ho gaya he
 In this sense, the family relationship seems to be a legal type, despite not being bland
 agar vasundhara raaje or lalit modi ke paariwarik sambandh hai to donon halafname ke bare main alag-alag kyon bol rahe hai
 Vasundhara has said the same line about that affidavit that i do not know
 lalit modi kehete hai ki wo to landan kii court main jamaa he
 Don't know why she is refusing kya paariwarik sambandh bataa dene se yah jawaab mil jaataa he ki netaa vipaksh kii haisiyat se vasundhara raaje ne bhartiya agenciyon ko na pataa chalane kii shart par halafanama kyon diya
 Does BJP believe that giving affidavit is not wrong
 halafanama diya gaya he isaki jaanch koun karegaa
 BJP does not see any corruption in it
 sundhashu trivedi ne kaha lalit modi kaa bhrashtachar kiske kaal main hua
 When corruption has occurred due to this statement of Sundhu Shishu, then giving Vasundhara's affidavit in the name of having a family relationship with Lalit Modi is not to save the corrupt
 bijepi kahati he ki congress kaa sawaal karnaa haasyaaspad he
 The Congress spokesperson is asking the same question every day
 shuukravaar ko jairam ramesh ne poocha ki 5 dinon main party ne 34 sawaal puche hai
 Jairam Ramesh targeted the Prime Minister through yoga rugs and said that the whole country is listening to the roar of the Prime Minister's silence
 tippaniyan We hope that after Yoga Day, the Prime Minister who is sitting in a posture, the ears are closed, the nose is closed, the eyes are closed, the mouth is closed
 ek saath
 Its name is Lalitasana
 jo lalitasana par baithe hue hai pichley chaar dinon se, ham ummid karte hai ki pradhanmantri antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke baad lalitasana se asli duniya main padhaarenge
 Ramesh said that the case of the Lalit Modi scandal is not a case of misbehavior but a matter of internal ties
 chota modi or bada modi main nexs he
 Ramesh dragged industrialist Gautam Adani in his charge and the nexus that had formed between the Prime Minister, Amit Shah and Gautam Adani in the Gujarat Cricket Association is blossoming into a flower
 pradhanmantri bhi isamen shaamil hai
 CPM leader Vrinda Karat has also written a similar article in the Indian Express
 congress kahati he ki modi sarkaar or monsoon satr bachaane ke liye ek hi rasta he
 Resignation
 bijepi ne kah diya he ki istipha nahin hoga
 The Rajasthan BJP justified the transaction with Lalit Modi in Dushyant Singh's company and said that the money has been shown in the income tax and TDS has been given
 kya paariwarik sambandh or congress par aarope laga dene se maan liya jaae ki bijepi ne antim jawaab de diya he? Lalit Modi is smiling like a winner even during the two governments
 un par kisi bhi adaalat main koi aarope sabit nahin hua he isliye unki tulana filmon ke kisi aaleeshaan khalanaayak se bilkul hi nahin kar sakate hai
 But leave the hero in front of Lalit Modi, who has been refusing to come to India for five years, there is no Singham or Shinde who will create a moment of fear on his cool face
 ve vahaan king saise life ji rahe hai or ye yahaan unhen lekar pyaade kii tarah bhid rahe hai
 The UPA government got four years, it has been more than a year since the NDA government, but Lalit Modi is fearless
 agar lalit nirdosh hai to kam se kam insaaf kaa takaaza itnaa to banataa hi he ki jin logon ne maasoom or bekasoor lalit ko maa bharti kii mitti se dur kiya he unke kilaaf maamla darj ho or unhen jail bheja jaae
 Nobody says this
 kya aapane aisa kuch bayaan suna ki intazaar kiijie maheene do maheene main lalit modi ko pravartan nideshaalay or rajasav intelligence nideshaalay ke darvaaze par laa denge
 Rather, BJP Vice President Shyam Jaju said in the program of Nidhi Vice Chancellor, 'lalit Modi is available there with the permission of law
 idi ke liye uplabdh hai
 Who is called a fugitive
 jo uplabdh nahin he use kaha jaataa he
 They are available with the permission of the court
 idi ne shikaayat nahin kii he ki wo hamaare liye uplabdh nahin hai
 Now he has to investigate where and where not, the law gives him freedom
 shyaam jaju bijepi ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh hai
 So does the Modi government also believe that Lalit Modi is in London under the given freedom of law
 unka vahaan hona galat nahin he
 Experts in the cricket world rightly say that it is not easy to lay hands on Lalit Modi
 lalit modi ke ek twit se congress ke ek mantri kaa istipha ho jaataa he, ek bayaan se sushamaa ke saath-saath vasundhara raaje shaq ke ghere main aa jaati hai magar lalit modi ko koi chunauti nahin detaa

 vasundhara raaje ke maamle par bijepi ne apni chuppi tod di
 The party's national spokesperson in Delhi, Sundhashu, said that Vasundhara ji had accepted that she had close family ties with Mr
 Modi
 is vishay ko unhone kabhi deny nahin kiya
 The authenticity of the documents is not yet verified
 doosraa, jo unke putr or bhaajapa saansad shri dushyant ke company main nivesh kaa vishay he, to ye koi nayaa vishay nahin he
 All these facts are self-evident in the return of income tax and in his affidavit while filing the nomination of MP
 to ye chiz pehle se hi saarvajanik sangyaan main he
 Even this subject was brought to the notice of the High Court and it was not considered for consideration
 parivaarwaad or paariwarik sambandh ek he yaa alag-alag ye aap sanskrit or hindi ke teacher se puch lijiega
 Familyism is an issue in politics, but family relations seems to have become a certificate
 is lihaaz se paariwarik sambandh khandaani na hote hue bhi kuch kanoonee tip lagata he
 If Vasundhara Raje and Lalit Modi have family ties then why are both speaking separately about the affidavit
 vasundhara ne us halafname ke bare main ek hi line kaha he ki mujhe nahin pataa
 Lalit Modi says that he is deposited in a London court
 pataa nahin kyon inkaar kar rahi hai
 Is it possible to get an answer as to why the Vasundhara Raje has given an affidavit to the Indian agencies on the condition that they do not know as the leader of the opposition? kya bijepi yah maanati he ki halafanama dena galat nahin he
 Who will investigate the affidavit given
 bijepi ko isamen kuch bhi bhrashtachar nahin dikhataa he
 Sundashu Trivedi said in whose time Lalit Modi was corrupted
 sundhashu ji ke is bayaan se jab bhrashtachar hua he tab is aadhaar par vasundhara kaa lalit modi ke saath paariwarik sambandh nibhaane ke naam par halafanama dena kya bhrashtachari ko bachaana nahin he
 BJP says it is ridiculous to question Congress

 On Friday, Jairam Ramesh asked that in 5 days, the party has asked 34 questions
 jairam ramesh pradhanmantri ke yoga ke asana ke zariye nishaanaa banaate hue kaha ki pradhanmantri ke maun kii dahaad sara desh sun rahaa he
 The comments ham ummid karte hai ki yoga diwas ke baad pradhanmantri jo ek asana main baithe hue hai, kaan band he, naak band he, aankh band he, munh band he
 Together
 iskaa naam lalitasana he
 Those who have been sitting on Lalitasan for the last four days, we expect the Prime Minister to visit Lalitasan in the real world after International Yoga Day
 ramesh ne kaha ki lalit modi cond kaa maamla galat vyavhaar kaa nahin balki andruni santh ganth kaa maamla he
 Chhota Modi and Bada Modi have nexus
 ramesh apane aarope main udyogpati gautam adani ko ghaseet laae or gujarat cricket sangh main jo pradhanmantri, amit shah or gautam adani ke bich nexs bana tha wo phool banakar khil rahaa he
 The Prime Minister is also involved in this
 sipiem netaa vrinda karaat ne bhi isi tarah kaa ek lekh indian express main likhaa he
 The Congress says that there is only one way to save the Modi government and the monsoon session
 istipha
 BJP has said that there will be no resignation
 rajasthan bijepi ne dushyant singh kii company main lalit modi ke saath hue len dein ko sahi bataaya or kaha ki inakam tex main paise ko dikhaaya gaya he or tids diya gaya he
 Should we assume that the BJP has given the final answer by accusing the family relations and the Congress? magar paanch saal se bharat aane se manaa kar rahe lalit modi ke saamne nayak chhodiye koi singhm yaa shinde jaisaa daaroga bhi nahin jo unke bindaas chehre par pal bhar ke liye khuf paidaa kar de
 They are living a king size life there and they are fighting like pawns with them here
 upie kii sarkaar ko chaar saal mila, endie kii sarkaar ke ek saal se zyaada ho gaye magar lalit modi bemauf hai
 If Lalit is innocent, at least justice is done so that the people who have taken innocent and innocent Lalit off the soil of Mother Bharati should file a case and be sent to jail
 yah bhi to koi nahin kahata
 Have you heard such a statement that wait in two months, Lalit Modi will be brought to the door of Enforcement Directorate and Directorate of Revenue Intelligence
 balki bijepi ke upaadhyaksh shyaam jaju ne nidhi kulapati ke kaarykram main kaha, 'lalit modi kanoon kii anumati lekar vahaan uplabdh hai

 Shyam Jaju is the bjp's national vice president

 It is not wrong for them to be there
 cricket kii duniya ke jaankaar thik hi kehete hai ki lalit modi par haath daalana aasaan nahin he
 a tweet from Lalit Modi leads to the resignation of a Congress minister, with a statement that Sushma as well as Vasundhara Raje fall under suspicion but does not challenge Lalit Modi
 likhte rahiye lalit niabandh magar unke lalit prabandh ke saamne sab feekaa
 The BJP broke its silence on the case of Vasundhara Raje
 dilli main party ke rashtriya pravaktaa sundhashu ne kaha ki vasundhara ji ne ye baat sweekaar kii he ki shri modi ji ke saath un logon ke nazadiiki paariwarik sambandh the
 He never denied this subject

 You will ask Sanskrit and Hindi teacher whether familyism and family relations are same or different

 In this sense, the family relationship seems to be a legal type, despite not being bland
 agar vasundhara raaje or lalit modi ke paariwarik sambandh hai to donon halafname ke bare main alag-alag kyon bol rahe hai
 Vasundhara has said the same line about that affidavit that i do not know

 Don't know why she is refusing kya paariwarik sambandh bataa dene se yah jawaab mil jaataa he ki netaa vipaksh kii haisiyat se vasundhara raaje ne bhartiya agenciyon ko na pataa chalane kii shart par halafanama kyon diya
 Does BJP believe that giving affidavit is not wrong
 halafanama diya gaya he isaki jaanch koun karegaa
 BJP does not see any corruption in it
 sundhashu trivedi ne kaha lalit modi kaa bhrashtachar kiske kaal main hua

 tippaniyan We hope that after Yoga Day, the Prime Minister who is sitting in a posture, the ears are closed, the nose is closed, the eyes are closed, the mouth is closed
 ek saath
 Its name is Lalitasana
 jo lalitasana par baithe hue hai pichley chaar dinon se, ham ummid karte hai ki pradhanmantri antarrashtriya yoga diwas ke baad lalitasana se asli duniya main padhaarenge
 Ramesh said that the case of the Lalit Modi scandal is not a case of misbehavior but a matter of internal ties
 chota modi or bada modi main nexs he
 Ramesh dragged industrialist Gautam Adani in his charge and the nexus that had formed between the Prime Minister, Amit Shah and Gautam Adani in the Gujarat Cricket Association is blossoming into a flower
 pradhanmantri bhi isamen shaamil hai
 CPM leader Vrinda Karat has also written a similar article in the Indian Express

 Resignation
 bijepi ne kah diya he ki istipha nahin hoga
 The Rajasthan BJP justified the transaction with Lalit Modi in Dushyant Singh's company and said that the money has been shown in the income tax and TDS has been given

 The comments ham ummid karte hai ki yoga diwas ke baad pradhanmantri jo ek asana main baithe hue hai, kaan band he, naak band he, aankh band he, munh band he

 ramesh ne kaha ki lalit modi cond kaa maamla galat vyavhaar kaa nahin balki andruni santh ganth kaa maamla he
 Chhota Modi and Bada Modi have nexus
 ramesh apane aarope main udyogpati gautam adani ko ghaseet laae or gujarat cricket sangh main jo pradhanmantri, amit shah or gautam adani ke bich nexs bana tha wo phool banakar khil rahaa he

 BJP has said that there will be no resignation

 Should we assume that the BJP has given the final answer by accusing the family relations and the Congress? ham ummid karte hai ki yoga diwas ke baad pradhanmantri jo ek asana main baithe hue hai, kaan band he, naak band he, aankh band he, munh band he
