 BJP has demolished the strong Left Fort in Tripura in 2018 itself
 ab desh main kerala hi iklauta suba bachaa he, jahaan vamadalon kaa shashan he
 In this Lok Sabha election, BJP may not open an account here, but its vote percentage has increased by two and a half percent and the vote share of NDA has increased by five percent
 bijepi ne ab kerala main laal durg par fatah ke liye yojana banani shuru kar di he
 The discussion is about winning Kerala with Tripura model, but Aajtak
 in se baatcheet main bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv sunil devdhar tripura kii jagah 'pashchim bengal model' ko zyada sateek maanate hai
 He claims that if everything goes well, then in 2021 BJP will do some miracles in Kerala
 nahin to 2024 ke loksabhaa chunaav main left kaa safaya karke rahegi
 Congress cleans the left, now we will clean the Congress: BJP strategist Sunil Deodhar Aajtak, who is in charge of Deodharripura, cleansing the Left
 in se baatcheet main daawa karte hai ki 2024 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi kerala se vamadalon kaa safaya kar degi
 He said- i think there is some difference between Tripura and Kerala
 kerala main tripura nahin balki pashchim bengal model safal hoga
 Deodhar said that in West Bengal we could never fight a direct fight with CPM
 magar is bich ubhare tiemasi naamak khilaadi ne vamadalon kaa safaya kar diya or ab ham rajya se tiemasi kaa safaya kar rahe hai
 The results of the Lok Sabha elections are indicative of this
 thik pashchim bengal kii tarah kerala ko dekhie
 Here this time Congress has eliminated the Left Front in the Lok Sabha elections, so it is auspicious sign for BJP
 ham to chaahate hi hai congress se aamane-saamne kii ladaai
 Now we will easily eliminate Congress from Kerala
 kerala main kya he bijepi kii chunauti?bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv sunil devdhar kaa maananaa he ki kerala main isai or muslim voters zyada hai
 Religious groups have more influence on them

 Deodhar said, "in Kerala, the Congress and the Left proves the BJP to be a villain in the eyes of Muslims and Christian communities under a politics
 taaki bijepi kaa ubhaar roka ja sake
 Whereas PM Modi has spoken about the interests of minorities in the speech after winning the election
 vah sabakaa-saath sabakaa vikaas kii baat karte hai
 The biggest challenge is the intervention of religious organizations in the bjp's path in Kerala
 magar ham is chunauti se paar paakar hi rahenge
 Explaining the reason for the Congress's good performance in the Lok Sabha elections, Sunil Deodhar said, "we strongly raised the issue of Sabarimala, this created public anger against the ruling Left, but Hindu voters shifted to Congress considering the BJP to be weak
" magar ham maanate hai ki aaj kaa hindu voter jo congress kii taraf majaburi main gaya he, vah hi kal kaa hamaara voter hoga
 Our focus is on connecting the Hindu voters who have moved to the Congress
 ham aage keralaki janata kii najar main bijepi ko majboot vikalp ke taur par pesh karenge
 It may be that miracles will happen in 2021 itself
 2024 main kerala kaa haal tripura jaisaa kii taiyaaribijepi cover karne vaale or ek rashtriya dainik se jude varisht patrkaar himanshu mishra kehete hai ki bijepi ko bengal or tripura kii tarah kerala main bhi vampanth ke kamjor padane kaa signal mil chukaa he

 hinmashu kehete hai ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan sipiem se naaraaz voter ko ek majboot vikalp kii talash thi, jo bijepi puri karti nahin dikhi to ve congress kii taraf mud gaye
 Even though bjp's nominal vote percentage has increased, the party is excited that if it puts some more emphasis then the fight in the state can be limited between Congress and BJP
 vamadalon se sidhaa saamana karne kii bajaae congress se muqabla bijepi ko aasaan lagata he
 Himanshu says that now the BJP is trying to present itself as an alternative to the voters by making it the number two party till the 2021 assembly elections so that the Tripura situation in Kerala can be done in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections

 kerala main kya karne vaali he bijepi?tripura main kisi ne sochaa nahin tha ki kabhi vamgarh tripura main mahaj 1
 The BJP, which gets 5 percent of the vote, will later wipe out the Left parties
 tripura main 2018 ke vidhansabha chunaavon me bijepi ne 60 main se 35 siten jitkar apratyaashit rup se sarkaar banaai
 BJP sources are saying that now the Tripura model is also preparing to collapse the Left stronghold in Kerala
 iskaa khaakaa aresas ne tripura kii tarj par bichaana shuru kar diya he
 In order to make inroads in every section of Kerala, BJP and RSS officials will continuously campaign in action mode

 However, the RSS mission in Kerala has already started

 das maheene kii umr main dimagi bukhaar menengitis se peedit hone ke kaaran jorge abraham kii optic nerve or retina kharaab hone se vah drushtibaadhit ho gaye
 However, his life today is very different from that of other visually impaired, as his parents relied on his ability to see his blindness, his progress and life as a problem in the way of normal and successful living
 jorge abraham ek motiveshnal spikar, trainer or communicator hai or drushtibadhiton kii jindagi main sakaaratmak badlaav laane ke liye samaaj ke nazariye main badlaav laane kii muhim main jute hai
 The real problem is not the sight
 
 
 jorge kehete hai, 'asli samasya najar main nahin, nazariye main he
 Whenever a person meets a blind person, his attention is focused only on this lack of his complete personality and abilities
 yahaan tak ki kisi ghar main drushtibaadhit bachche ke janm par uske mata-pita bhi uske liye sambhaavnaaon kaa aasmaan talashne kii jagah uske bhavishya kii chintaa main dub jate hai
 'career built on the basis of good education
 
 
 jorge ne acchhee shiksha hasil karke vigyaapan jagat main safal kariyar banaaya he
 He says, 'the visually impaired are often marginalized in society
 unhen anya logon kesaman shiksha yaa kariyarke avasar yaa samaaj main baraabar sthaan nahin diya jaataa
 'george adds,' For the first time when he went to a school for the visually impaired, he was shocked to see the poor infrastructure, low level teaching material and the society's hopelessness with the visually impaired
 unhone dekha ki drushtibaadhit bacchon ko behad nikrusht or asahaay samajha jaataa he or unhen yah maanane par majaboor kiya jaataa he ki ve jindagi main zyada kuch nahin kar sakate
 After seeing all this, he quit his job
 
 
 jorge ne usee kshan pratishthit vigyaapan company 'ogilvi and mather' kii apni naukari chhodkar drushtibadhiton kii jindagi main roshni laane ke liye logon kenzariye main badlavalane kii muhim shuru karne kaa faisla kiya
 a cricket enthusiast since childhood, George promoted cricket for the blind and held the first national championship in Delhi in 1990
 1996 main unhone 'world blind cricket council' kii sthapana kii or 1998 main drushtibadhiton ke liye vishwa cap cricket kaa aayojan kiya
 Changes brought with the help of British Airways
 
 
 saath hi unhone british airways kii madad se bharat ke anek kshetron main jaakar drushtibaadhit yuvaaon ke liye vyaktitv vikaas or comunication skills kii workshops yojit kii
 George says, "he realized during this time that a lot could be changed by changing the perspective
" ' apane lakshya ko thos rup dene ke liye jorge ne drushtibadhita ke saath jeene ke liye kisi bhi prakaar kii jaankaree hasil karne ke centre ke rup main 2002 main score foundation or project 'ive' launch kiya
 Program on Radio and Doordarshan
 
 
 isi disha main or ek kadam aage badhaate hue 2005 main unhone radio kaarykram 'ive : ye he roshni kaa kaaravaan' shuru kiya
 The program, broadcast across the country on All India Radio, narrated its success stories by reaching the heights of success surpassing the challenges of life
 ive ne aam aadmi ke nazariye main badlaav laane ke liye doordarshan par ek shrankhla bhi pesh kii 'najar yaa najariya', jiskaa sanchaalan diggaj abhinayta nasiruddin shah ne kiya tha
 George further states that this program was designed keeping in mind the common people, not the blind
 ve isamen aise vishyon ko uthaanaa chaahate the, jinke jariye ve netraheenta ke saath sambhaavnaaon ke akaash ko darsha saken
 George runs a helpdesk for the blind
 
 
 ive kaa helpadesk bhi he, jahaan drushtibaadhit or unke parijan phone karke apni samasyaon se jude sawaal puch sakate hai, maargdarshan praapt kar sakate hai or apane liye uplabdh suvidhaon or sansadhano se jud sakate hai
 George says that on many occasions he realized that sometimes the government and service providers like railways, banks, educational institutions discriminated against the visually impaired
 in muddon par badlaav laane or inhen aawaaj dene ke liye edvocacy campagne chalaanaa jaruri he
 George has received many honors
 
 
 jorge ko apane kaaryon ke liye kai sammaan or awords se nawaja ja chukaa he, jinamein saraswati sammaan, limca book of records, pipal of da year 2007 shaamil he
 Apart from this, he has also been featured in Discovery Channel's series 'discovery People' and 'aviva Forward Thinkers'
 jorge ne saamaanya skool, college se shiksha hasil kii
 He did his schooling at La Martinaire Lucknow, graduated in mathematics from the prestigious St
 Stephen's College in Delhi and did a Masters in Operations Research
 jorge likh chuke hai kitaab
 
 
 George is also the co-author of 'handbook of Inclusive Education for Educators, Administrators and Planners', a book on inclusive education
 vah khud ko is maamle mensaubhagyashaaleemante hai, lekin unka kahana he ki haalanki samaveshi shiksha ek shashakt concept he, lekin jis prakaar se bharat main ise lagu kiya jaataa he, vah prabhaavshaalee hone ke sthaan par nakaaratmak sabit hota he
 He says, "society's expectations from the visually impaired are extremely low, but the society and its family themselves have to see them as a potential human resource rather than sympathetic
 unke mata-pita ne unase skool main behatar karne, ghar main apni bhoomika nibhaane, shiksha puri hone ke baad ek acchhee naukari kii ummid kii
 These expectations only fill confidence in any child growing up
 ummid he, dhire-dhire hi sahi, lekin najar ko dekhne ke logon ke nazariye main badlaav avashya aayega

 com / wgfenvytdh — Akshay Ka Fan gold (@akshaykafanakf) June 15, 2018 These dialogues of Race 3 do not get into the heart nor make sense of the fuss story, the suspense of poor screenplayers-3, and the twists and turns that the makers made
 - Large claims were made
 lekin film main naa hi koi twist he naa suspence
 The screenplay of the film is quite weak

 Race 3 was said to be dangerous and a better stunt than previous race films
 lekin logon kaa riection kuch or hi kahata he
 The film stunt scenes are shown unnecessarily
 kabhi bhi ladaai shuru ho jaati he
 Chase sequences and fight sequences are long, causing boredom
 ection seens ke liye mahangi gaadiya udayi gai hai, khub paisa kharch kiya gaya he
 But these stunt scenes are unable to impress
 yun hi hawa main gaadiyaan ud rahi hai or goliyaan chal rahi hai

 The music of the film is given by Salim Suleman
 movie main 7 gane hai jisamen se song 'celfish' ko salmaan khan ne likhaa he
 Salman was also made fun of by the lyrics of the song, while Yuliya Vantur has sung the Selfish Song
 logon ne ulia ke gaanaa gane ko bhi trol kiya he
 The voice of Atif Aslam in 'selfish' Song also could not connect the music lovers
 yaad ho res-1 kaa romantic song 'pehali najar' bhi aatif ne gaaya tha
 This song is still liked among people today

 Sanjay Raut, however, has not clarified whether he is in support of or opposed to the bill

 West Indies captain Darren Sammy said that if his batsmen play at the crease with inspiration from Shivnarine Chanderpaul, he will try to give India a target of 350 runs in the first Test cricket match
 westeindies ne pehali pari main 95 ran kii badhat hasil karne ke baad duusari pari main 21 ran par do wicket ganvaa diye hai lekin saimi ko lagata he ki yadi unke ballebaaj dhary banaaye rakhte hai to bharat ko majboot lakshya dena mushkil nahin hoga
 Sammy said after the end of the second day's play, "see, we can't think of giving a target of 450 runs but we will try to score as many runs as possible
 bangladesh main bhi ham aisi paristhitiyon main khele the or hamaari yahi ranneeti vahaan bhi rahi thi
 He said, "the wicket is slow and the ball is low
 aise main ballebaajon ko krij par paanv jamaane honge
 The way Shiva (chandrapal) batted in the first innings, if he plays the same way, then runs will be scored
 ham 350 ke kareeb lakshya dene ke bare main soch rahe hai
 Sammy credited his bowlers for putting the Indian team on 209 runs
 unhone kaha,‘hamen apni kshamta par puraa vishwaas he
 Full credit goes to our bowlers
 unki shuruyaat acchhee rahi lekin hamane dhairya banaaye rakhaa
 We adopted the strategy of wicket to wicket and straight ball which also gave us success
 ’saimi ne kaha ki unke gendbaaj bharat ko donon pariyon par out karne kaa madda rakhte hai
 He said, 'we never doubted the ability of our bowlers
 hamane westeindies main bharat ko teen chaar avasaron par out kiya tha
 We believe in our ability to bowl in the right area

 Taking a dig at Modi, Sonia Gandhi today said that he is playing a patriotic dance and misleading the public
 loksabhaa chunaav kii ghoshnaa ke baad dilli main apni pehali saarvajanik sabha ko sambodhit karte hue congress adhyaksh ne mukhyamantri banane ke baad sarkaar se bhaagane ke liye arvind kejariwal kii bhi aalochana kii
 Sonia referred to the 'historic' work 'done by the UPA government and appealed to the people to form the UPA government once more
 unhone kaha ki kuch log deshbhakti kaa nagada baja rahe hai
 'tell me, those who do not believe in secular values, can understand the spirit of patriotism
 ve aapako gumraah kar keval apane or apane logon ke liye satta hathiyanna chaahate hai
 ' sonia ne modi kaa naam nahin liya, lekin unka ishaara modi kii hi ore tha
 a few days ago, Modi described Defense Minister AK Antony as a Pakistani agent
 sonia ne kaha ki deshbhakti congress kii nason main he or congress netaaon kii ‘qurbaani’ se ise siikhaa ja saktaa he
 He called the Lok Sabha elections a battle of two ideologies and asked the people to defeat the extremist and divisive ideology of the BJP
 vahiin kejariwal par nishaanaa sadhate hue sonia ne kaha ki kuch log sochate the ki sarkaar chalaanaa bacchon kaa khel he
 'you saw how they ran away from Delhi (government)
 ' In an attempt to woo the Dalits and the poor, Sonia referred to the laws to end the practice of manual scavenging and to give legal status to hawkers
 unhone kaha ki police or prashasan ab pheriwaalon ko tang nahin kar sakenge
 Referring to the work done by the UPA government for Muslims, he said that the government has implemented most of the recommendations of the Sachar Committee
 unhone kaha ki agar satta main phir aayi to congress janata ko swasthya suraksha or jaruratmandon ko pension kii vyavastha karegi
 Sonia said that for them the Ganga Jamuni tradition is more important than power and people with bad intentions will lead the nation and society to destruction and darkness
 unhone janata se kaha, 'mujhe aapaki budhimatta main vishwaas he
 i am sure you will do no wrong and support the Congress
 ' unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kii vichaardhaara samaaj ko baantati he or ek bhai ko duusare se ladaati he jabaki congress samaaj ko ekajute rakhane main yakeen karti he or har kisi ko ek najar se dekhati he
 Earlier, Sonia addressed an election public meeting in Lakhimpur, Assam, intensifying the attack on BJP and its Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, to make people aware of this opposition party's 'politics of hate' and its false promises and big- Calling for big things not to be mislead
 unhone kaha, 'vipaksh khaskar bijepi puure desh main gum ghumkar badi badi baaten kar rahi he or jab centre main uski sarkaar thi, tab usne kya kiya?' unhone kaha ki bhaajapa or uske netaa ‘nafrat kii raajnneeti’ karne main lage hai
 He appealed to the people not to fall for the false promises of the opposition, but to use their discretion to decide in support of the Congress and vote for its candidates
 unhone ki congress ne desh kii ganga-jamuna samskruti majboot kii he
 The Congress President said, 'we do not make false promises
 ham jo vaade karte hai, use puraa karte hai
 The Congress believes in 'har Hath Shakti, Har Haath Pragati'
 ' Sonia said, 'we fulfilled all the promises made in the 2009 manifesto
 ham 2014 ke ghoshnaptr ke maamle main bhi yahi karenge or uske liye hamen aapkaa samarthan chahie
 The UPA president said, "there is a big difference between (opposition's) statement and action
" purvottar ke log asli rashtrawaad jaanate hai, aashaa he ki aap unke jhaanse main nahin aaenge jo bas rashtrawaad kaa dhol peetate hai
 ' bijepi par nishaanaa sadhate unhone kaha, 'congress ne hameshaa desh ke liye apana khun bahaya or balidaan diya he
 On the other hand, there is a party which has just divided the country
 ' unhone kaha ki aazaadee se pehle assam or anya sthanon par congress kaaryakarta desh ke liye balidaan dete rahe or aazaadee ke baad congress hi rashtranirmaan main lagi rahi
 Sonia alleged, 'where were BJP and other parties then? There was no sign of opposition before and after independence
 ve bas desh ko baantne main lage hai

 What did the Congress get after eating around on the motion for impeachment against the Chief Justice of India? The Congress knew that the impeachment motion could not be passed at any cost
 phir bhi wo prastaav laai to jaahir he ki vah chif justise par dabaav bananaa chaahati he
 At first the Vice President rejected the impeachment motion of the Congress
 iske khilaaf 7 may ko congress ke do saansad supreme court pahunche par us bench main sunwaayee nahin jahaan ve pahunche
 After this, a constitution bench of five judges was constituted late in the evening to hear the matter and its information was put on the website and the hearing was fixed on 8 May
 sabase mahatvapurn baat ye thi ki sunwaayee karne vaali peeth main chif justise or janvari ke maheene main press conference karchif justisake khilaaf aarope lagane vaale chaaron jaj shaamil nahin the
 In the order of preference, the judges from number six to ten started hearing the Congress plea and asked the Congress lawyers to debate the merits of the issue but the lawyers were adamant that the administrative order for constitution bench should be provided to them 
 samvidhan peeth gathan kaa aadesh unhen nahin diya gaya or unase kaha gaya ki yaa to ve arji waapas le len yaa phir peeth ise khaarij kar degi
 The lawyer withdrew the petition on behalf of the Congress
 is yachika ke waapas hone ke baad bhi congress ke paas nae sire se yachika daakhil karne or prashasnic aadesh kii copy maangane kaa vikalp bachaa rahata he
 In some cases like Judge Loya case, due to non-availability of desired bench, the dragging from the court was already going on
 jajon kii janvari main hui press conference ke baad ek jaj ke ghar ek party ke netaa kaa janaa or uske chitra jagajaahir hona bataata he ki raajnneeti kis had tak is maamle main judi he
 The Congress was aware of the fate of its proposal within Parliament and the non-availability of the petition in the court, so it made a copy of the administrative order an issue
 darasal, congress court ke un faislon se pareshaan hai jo uske vot bank par asar daalate hai or un mukademon ke nateezon ko lekar ashankit he jinase uski raajnneeti par bura asar padataa he
 She accuses the Chief Justice of acting at the behest of the ruling party and in this order brought impeachment motion to pressure the CJI
 taaki chif justise kii badanaami ho
 But with the failure of the Congress, a message from the court was clear that the court did not bow down in front of political pressure
 desh ko is vakt nishpaksh adaalat kii bahut jarurat he kyonki netaaon kaa lagaataar patan ho rahaa he
 The Congress was the opposition party, if the party in power ever made such an effort to create pressure, then the court would have a double challenge
 congress ne chif justise ke karier par ye daag jarur laga diya ki ve pehle sijeai hai jinke khilaaf mahabhiyog kii prakriya shuru hui
 Also that four judges revolted against them
 par in sabase adaalat ko blackmel karne vaale prayaas bhi jagajaahir ho gaye
 The impeachment episode, despite its mouth-watering episode, helped the politically weakened Congress image of the party struggling in its vote bank and the party challenging the central government

 Film Name: Paper Fools Director: Anil Kumar Choudharystar Cast: Vinay Pathak, Mugdha Godse, Rayma Sen, Saurabh Shukla, Amit Bahl, Rajendra Sethi Duration: 109 minscertification: u / a Rating: 1 Star i am a writer, i have written a story, my The story is not printed, and that is why i am in the eyes of everyone because i truly believe
 inhi baton ko ek film ke madhyam se darshane kii purna koshish kii he diarector anil kumaar choudhary ne
 Will this 109-minute film entertain you? Let's know: Kahani is the story of the Model Town area of delhi where Purshottam Tripathi (vinay Pathak) is a writer whose book 'ek Thahiri Si Zindagi' is ready but no one is ready to print it and his wife Nikki (mugdha Godse) It seems that Purushottam does not try much, does not have the will to move forward, etc
 purushottam ek aid agency main kaam karata he lekin kinhi kaarnon se naukari chhodani padati he or aakhirkaar ek hi makasad rahata he khud ko, patni or gharavaalon kii najar main sabit karnaa
 Then slowly, noodles and Rajma's fight in the turbulence of life, sometimes a feud for superstition
 phir nikki kaa bhai (saurabh shukla) or kuku seth (rajendra sethi) ke baar main kaam karne vaali rubina (rima sen) ke entry or kahani aage badhati jaati he
 Vinay Pathak is once again in the same style that you have already seen in his previous films, this time playing his character as a husband and writer, while the actor Saurabh Shukla has been able to experiment fully
 Have failed
 mugdha jo kii ek punjabi parivaar kaa hissaa dikhaai gayi hai lekin samvaad bolte vakt unki hindi bhi badi mushkil se nikalati he jisaki vajah se unke chehre or kehane ke bhav bilkul vipareet se lagane lagate hai, rima sen ne apane rubina ke kirdaar ko ek had tak jeevant kiya he lekin kul milakar yah film manoranjan ke madhyam se aapako santusht kar paane main asamarth dikhti he
 There is no need to sing a single song in the film because the moment the songs come, they spoil the rhythm of the film, suddenly, in the voice of Shaan, Vinay Pathak is seen singing the song to you and there is music in the background during the scene too
 Does not satisfy
 film main kuch samvaad hasyaprad hai jaise 'anguthi ke naag ko nagina kehete hai, jo pyaar karke dhokhaa de use kamina kehete hai ' to kuch gyaan se bharpoor - 'riter vahi kehalaata he jiskaa likhaa logon tak pahunche ' or 'kabhi kisi ke ghar kaa imotional dustbin nahin bananaa chahie'
 Scenes from mother-in-law like 'vicky Donor' are also seen in this film
 yah film 109 minute kii hi he lekin dekhte-dekhte kaaphi badi lagane lagati he or puri film ke dauraan shaayad hi aap kabhi 3-4 second ke liye hansate hue najar aaen, to is hafte apane paise or vakt ko aap bachaakar kisi or kaam main laga sakate hai
 Why watch? If you are a very crazy fan of actor Vinay Pathak or Mugdha Godse Yaraima Sen, then only watch this film

 The file of this 67-year-old British citizen is now at the top of the india-uk dialogue agenda
 worle ko yahaan laakar us par mukadmaa chalaane kii aakhri koshish ke taur par bharat ne britain par kutanatik dabaav banane kaa faisla kiya he
 CBI Director Ranjit Sinha recently met Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh and requested him to take up the matter with the British Foreign Secretary
 agency agar worle kaa pratyrpan karaane main naakaam rahati he, to yah uski teesri vifaltaa hogi
 In the case of extradition, CBI has been defeated twice before this
 2006 main nausena waar room li maamle main aaropee ravishankaran ko britain ne saunpane se manaa kar diya tha
 Denmark has also refused to hand over to Kim Dewey, an accused in the 1995 downpour of aircraft in Purulia
 sibiai ke mutabik, worle 1980 ke dashak ke aakhir or 1990 ke dashak ke shuru main panaji ke anathalay gurukul main akasar aayaa karata tha
 It was operated by a German citizen Freddy Albert Peets, whom some people of Goa called from Honor to Father Freddy
 lekin 1991 main police ne anathalay par chapa maaraa to uske haath antarrashtriya bal sex giroh kii harkaton ke saboot lage
 2,305 indecent photographs of children were found there
 kuch tasveeron main bacchon ke saath behad ghinaune krity kiye gaye the
 According to the CBI, Varley sexually abused the children and took nude pictures of a little girl
 sibiai kaa aarope he ki vah zyaadaatar christmas ke samay us anathalay main aata tha, taaki uskaa aparaadh jashn ke maahaul main chhip jaae
 Police had filed charge sheets against Pete's, Worley and some other foreigners
 pits ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha, jisaki baad main jail main hi maut ho gai, lekin worle police ko chakma dekar bhaag gaya
 No clue was found for about ten years
 2000 main jab england main uskaa pataa chalaa to vah remand worle se martin ashley ban chukaa tha
 The extradition team of the New Scotland Yard Police asked the CBI to give detailed details about his alleged crime in India
 sibiai ne jab tak apni file taiyaar kii tab tak worle phir faraar ho chukaa tha
 British officials told the CBI that Varley had fled Kathmandu from England via Goa
 vahaan usne apana naam phir badal kar dead pole rakh liya tha
 But when CBI contacted the immigration authorities of Goa, there was no sign of a foreigner named Varley or Deed Poll
 yahaan tak ki british adhikariyon dwaara bataai gai taarikh par british passport rakhane vaale kisi vyakti ke goa aane kii jaankaree nahin thi
 That is, Varley then escaped by dodging
 sibiai ne 12 saal tak uskaa intjaar kiya
 Finally, in January 2012, Varley was arrested in Bangkok based on a Red Corner Notice issued by the CBI
 iske baavjood sibiai use apni giraft main nahin le saki, jo bharat main 30 maamalon main vaanchit apradhi he
 The Thailand authorities set him off on a flight to Britain
 sibiai ke ek adhikari kehete hai, ''worle kii giraftaar ke baad hamane thailand ke adhikariyon ko sari jaankaree muhaiyaa karai
 But before the agency was able to present its case to Bangkok, it was sent to Britain
 ”agency ke liye uskaa peechha karne kaa yah aakhri mauka he
 In May, a district judge refused to hand over Worley because he claimed to be suffering from amnesia
 is bich, bharat kii ore se maamle ko dekhne vaali crown prosicution sarvice (sipies) ke vakil maaikel omo video conferencing ke jariye jaanch agency se sampark karne se inkaar kar rahe hai or 20 june va 27 june ko tay baithkon ko radd kar chuke hai
 After all the CBI protests, CPS filed a statement before the High Court on 21 July on Varley's claim that he was suffering from amnesia
 sibiai kii maang he ki worle ke dimag kii jaanch kisi sarkari doctor se karai jaae
 He says it makes no sense for Worley to report to a psychiatrist
 worle ko hycourt ke saamne 11 agast ko apana jawaab daakhil karnaa he
 It is also being said that CBI chief Sinha has also cited the extradition treaty of 1983 with Britain, requesting to create diplomatic pressure, according to which the CPS has to meet with countries seeking extradition in the larger interest of justice It has been said to cooperate
 britain ko raji karnaa itnaa mushkil nahin hona chahie, kyonki vahaan 1970 ke dashak main bacchon ke yon shoshan ke maamle main worle ko doshi qaraar diya ja chukaa he
 Worley's first crime was reported when he was Biseque and worked as a child protection officer in Halifax, West Yorkshire
 baad main us par bal yon pornography giroh kaa sadsy hone kaa aarope laga
 That crime of his was also opened by chance
 jacleen oldfield naam kii ek choti ladki ne dekha ki worle do ladakon ko ek car main thuns rahaa he to use andeh hua
 In 1975, Varley confessed to the crime of committing profanity and criminal conspiracy with children aged 9 years to 14 years
 use 1980 ke dashak main reeha kar diya gaya or phir usne albenia, srbija or thailand main angreji ke nijee shikshak ke taur par kaam kiya
 Worley is now out on bail, but is monitored
 use 16 saal se chote bacchon ke kareeb jane or skulon va khel ke maidaanon main jane kii ijaajat nahin he
 But this is not enough
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki remand andrew worle ko goa main maasoom va asahaay bacchon ke saath kukarm karne ke liye kanoon kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 The High Court of Justice of England and Wales will hear cbi's appeal on 10 October
 agar sibiai ke paksh main faisla hota bhi he to worle ke paas bachane kaa ek or mauka baaki he—vah upree adaalat main faisle ko chunauti de saktaa he

 Book: What would have happened if not? Author: Ravi Bulekimat: 199 Rupayakvar: Paperback Publisher: harpercollins Publishers India: Ravi Bulle is no longer an introvert in Hindi literature
 2008 main aayaa unka pehla kahani sangrah 'aaine, sapane or vasantsena' unke lekhan kaushal ko bayaan karne ke liye kaaphi hai
 'yun Na Hota To Kya Hota' is his second story collection and takes his writing to new heights
 ravi bule ke is kahani sangrah kii pehali kahani he 'main ek bayaan'
 The name itself creates an image in the mind that a person is filing a statement in a case
 ji haa apane sahi samajha, is kahani main ek maamle kii sunwaayee court main chal rahi he or aaropee apni safai main kuch bol rahaa he
 Just the whole story is based on this
 aaropee court ko bataane main laga he ki 'chanda' ke saath jo kuch bhi hua usamen uskaa koi dosha nahin he or jo hua wo anjaane main hua
 Here is the last part of the story
 
 
 '
 
 
 And then that night, because of which i am standing in this box, it became accidental while watching
 vah khel-khel main chaaku le ai
 i refused him
 lekin vah nahin maani
 The theme of the day was that i would rape her at Knife Point
 main vahi karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha
 She was also defending herself with full force
 or tabhi kuch is tarah meraa haath uske goun main ulajhaa ki nonkdaar chaaku sidhe uski gardan main utar gaya
 When Sahiba, please do not look at me like this
 main aapaki ankhon main faisle ko pard saktaa hum
 You have to give judgment in the light of facts, not in the flow of emotions
 phir chanda meri kahaan he? vah coma main he
 
 
 
 or use kabhi bhi hosh aa saktaa he
 His statement is still pending
 'duusari kahani he 'yun naa hota to kya hota' jiske naam par hi is pustak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 This is the story of the life of Pandey living in Allahabad, who was a family wrestler but Honi had given him Mumbai and made him a watchman
 pesh he is kahani kaa ek rochak prasang
 
 
 pooja-pathi, Chotadhari Janaudhari, Tilakdhari
 
 
 pandey ji ek ambedkar aurat ke apane par aise hansate dekh kar sakate main the
 And ka gajra, nath, earrings, necklace, bracelet, kardhan, pajeb, bindi, kajal, redness, powder
 
 
 sab uski hansi main shaamil the
 Every part of the woman's dark body was laughing at Pandey
 pandey ji kaa avsaad or gaharaa ho gaya
 
 
 No one had laughed at them like this till date
 dilli bhi nahin
 
 
 Delhi had only disarmed
 lekin is aurat kii hansi to pandey ji ko munh chidhaane vaali hansi thi
 Pandey was irritated
 teesri kahani he 'exclusive story' jo bataati he ki kaise patrakarita jagat main bhi bazaarwaad haaavee hota ja rahaa he
 Deendayal Parashar, the protagonist of the story, wanted to write a triangular story
 aisi kahani jisamen vah sampadak ko 'amrish puri' bananaa or khud salmaan khan bananaa chaahate the
 That is, 'I am a hero, you are a villain'
 unki kahani main 'eshwarya raay' bhi honi thi
 But due to the real-life salman-aishwarya breakup and Amrish Puri's take-off from the world, Deendayal Parashar dropped the idea of writing the story
 'is kahani kaa ant behad maarmik he or pathak ko sochane par majaboor kar detaa he
 This book has four stories and all four are unique
 in kahaniyon ko padhakar ye ehsaas hota he jaise inke paatr sajiv ho uthe hon or sari ghatnaayen aapke saamne ghatit ho rahi hon
 This style of kissing makes Ravi Bule different
 unki kahaniyon main sabakuch he
 If you are fond of reading good stories, then read this book

 Minisha told that she told Arya, 'I will not do this
 arya ne mujhe is bare main sochane ke liye bhi kaha tha
 Asked me if it would be ok to do hag or hold hands or maine ise ekadam galat kaha
 Arya went to Biffer on this matter and asked to see his mobile bill
 yahi nahin, unhone yah tak kah diya ki minisha unki garlfriend rah chuki hai
 And they were separated on Mutual Understanding
 arya ne bataaya ki big bos ke contract ke dauraan unase poocha gaya ki ve kisi kaa naam lenaa chahenge
 So he took the name of Minisha
 haalanki salmaan ne arya se kaha ki ghar ke baahar kii baat ko andar nahin lani chahie
 Minisha was very judicious and refused to react to Arya's remarks
 aaj danger asana par baithne kii baari arya kii thi
 When Salman told Arya that you are safe and can get up from this posture, Arya refuses to get up
 is par salmaan gussa ho gaye or bole ki aap mujhe atitude kyon dikhaa rahe ho
 i have gone through what you have gone through many times
 aakhir main arya or preetam surakshit nikalate hai
 Deepshikha, Sonali and Gautam are insecure, and Salman Khan will inform tomorrow who will come out of the house

 Just as the politics of Article 370 was more for wandering less Hindi states for Kashmir, similarly the Citizenship Amendment Bill is more for Hindi states for Assam or Northeast
 inhen pradeshon main ek dharm vishesh ko lekar purvaagrah itnaa majboot he ki use sulgaae rakhane ke liye aise mudde laae jate hai taaki vah apane purvagrahon ko or thos kar sake
 Looks like what he is thinking is being done only for him
 isaki baari qeemat desh chukaa rahaa he
 That is why i call Hindi state a cursed state
 jab bhi isaki zaruuraton par dhyaan dene kaa vakt aata he aise muddon se uski aakankshaon ko lip-pot diya jaataa he
 Hindi youth of the state is being converted into IT cell

 No matter how much you say that the wind that was created in the name of the intruders proved to be bogus after inflating thousands of crores of rupees, it would say that you want Bangladeshi or Rohingya to become citizens
 vah jaanata he ki rohingya naagarik nahin hai, sharnaarthi hai
 But even then he will say this because his thinking is less information, perception is more
 isliye use trigar karne ke liye aise mudde laae jate hai
 The Citizenship Amendment Bill plays with the core spirit of the Constitution
 ab hindi pradesh is bill ko lekar khelenge
 The same thing happened in the Assam Accord that only Bangladeshis who came between 1951 and 1971 will be accepted
 isamen hindu yaa muslim ke lihaaz se farq nahin he
 The Akhil Assam Students Union (AASU) says that the BJP is misrepresenting
 sampradayik agenda chalaa rahi he
 If this happens, the question of identity will arise again in Assam
 assam kaa maamla behad samvedansheel he
 In 1983, there was a fierce movement in Assam
 hinsa hui thi
 More than 800 people were martyred
 unhen assam kii raajnneeti main shahid kaha jaataa he
 Assam is very worried
 puraa assam suraksha alert par he
 More than thousand security forces are deployed in Guwahati
 assam ke sangeetkaar zubin garg ne elaan kiya he ki nae naagarikta sanshodhan bill ke kilaaf chah disambar ko virodh pradarshan karenge
 One of his songs 'rajneeti Mat Karo Bandhu' has become a representative song to protest against this bill
 unhone sabhi mul nivasee sanghathanon se apil kii he ki sab milakar iskaa virodh karen
 The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti has also opposed this
 bijepi is raajnneeti main khud ulajh rahi he
 Opposed Section 370 because there should be a law in the country
 ab khabar aa rahi he ki purvottar ke teen rajyon ko iske daayre se baahar rakhaa jayega
 Meaning the provisions of the Citizenship Amendment Bill will not apply there
 ye teen rajya hai arunachal pradesh, nagaland or manipur
 The provision of inner line permit area is applicable here
 yahaan par jane ke liye simit samay kaa permit miltaa he
 Media reports suggest that even tribal areas of Assam can be kept out of the purview of the new law
 isliye aap detail padhein or phir dekhen ki raajnneetik manch se aapako ullu banane ke liye puure masale ko ghuspaithiya naam dekar kyon pukaara ja rahaa he? aisa kaanoon kyon aa rahaa he jo puure desh main lagu nahin hoga? purvottar main hi puri tarah lagu nahin hoga?hindi pradesh jaagrit hota to itani aasaani se aise jatil vishyon par bevakoof nahin banaaya ja saktaa
 There is talk of removing intruders from all over the country
 or yahi nahin bataate ki kis niyam ke tahat kisi ko or kahaan nikaal denge
 When Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina comes, she does not talk about it
 kaha jaataa he ki yah bharat kaa aantarik maamla he
 That is, they will be locked in a center in India
 is par koi spashtataa nahin he lekin amit shah reliyon main bol aate hai
 Everyone knows that there is a Muslim on the surface of this issue
 purvaagrah grasit hindi pradesh ko bas yah dikh janaa chahie vah baaqi bill ke bare main jaananaa bhi nahin chahega

 vah jaanane kaa prayaas nahin karegaa ki assam main is bill ko lekar kitni alag alag raay he

 He said that i am openly a supporter of Modi and say that if there was no leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah in the country, then the decision on Ayodhya would not come, although this decision has been given by the court and is completely constitutional
 ramdev ne kaha ki itane bade faisle ke liye raajnneetik ichhashakti or saahas chahie kyonki kanoon vyavastha or intjaamon kaa bandobast karnaa hota he, ye lallu-panju ke bas kii baat nahin kyonki unhen pataa hi nahin desh kaise chalata he

 Also, if the resources fall short, then Ram devotees like me are ready to donate thousands of crores of rupees

 Our religion may be different but DNA and East are the same
 unhone kaha ki pramanikta ke saath kahata hum ki bharat ke 99 fisadi muslimon main apana hi swaroop dekhtaa hum kyonki sabhi dharmantarit muslim hai
 Cooperate in the construction of the temple, Muslim Yoga teacher said that Muslims should also cooperate for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, because he is also our brother
 unhone kaha ki saamaajik or raajnneetik kaarnon se muslimon kaa majahab hamale alag hua he lekin vah bhi hamaare hi hai
 Ramdev said that Hindus should also help in the construction of the mosque in Ayodhya to set an example of social harmony and brotherhood
 ramdev ne kaha ki log pehle kehete the ki ayodhya par faisla aayega to bavaal ho jayega lekin aaj sthiti ekadam ulat he or sabhi shanti se rah rahe hai
 He said that law and order is intact and not a single stone was thrown after the verdict came

 Going a step further, Karunanidhi said that if there is a proposal in Parliament against the FDI from the opposition, his party will support it because FDI in retail will have a bad effect on the public

 During this time the child suffered many serious injuries
 gujarat ke sabarkantha jile main 14 saal ke ek ladke ko magaramchh ne pakad liya
 Thankfully, his friends playing nearby heard a shout, so he immediately reached there and saved his friend from caution

 Former Minister of Defense Manohar Parrikar had said, his ministry is working on the goal of desegregation
 unhone kaha, ''dow
 According to Kalam's report, our target is 70% indigenization
 isamen chaar se paanch saal lagenge
 By the end of this government's term, we will touch 60 per cent
 "centre main bhaajapa kii sarkaar banane ke baad ''mek in india" kii disha main silsilewar kai upayon ko lagu kiya he, isameraksha kshetrako 49 fisadi pratyaksh videshi nivesh ke liye khole jane (or kuch maamalon main isse zyada) se lekar desi utpaadan ko badhaava dene ke liye indiniyasli dijind, dewelaped and menuphacchard (ididm) shrenee kaa nirmaan shaamil he
 The challenges and investments required outside the public sector — for technology, product development enablement and creation of infrastructures — are enormous and will take time
 philhal nijee kshetra kii bhagidaari behad maamuli he, jo kul raksha kshetra main 5 fisadi se bhi kam he
 That is why the government has got private sector companies to enter the sector with the hope of turning them into defense units independent of second-tier players and supplying defense equipment on their own
 pichley do varshon ke dauraan sarkaar ne deepiesu ko di jane vaali praathamikta ko waapas le liya he, jaise seemaa or utpaada shulk main riyaayat vagairah, taaki nijee kshetra uske saath barabari se pratispardhaa main aa sake
 There is a lot of movement on the policy front but the sluggishness remains at the implementation level
 kam se kam teen bade anubandh—landing plateform dox kaa nirmaan (aise jahaaj jo sainya tukadiyon or sainya vaahanon kaa parivahan kar saken); battlefield management systams kaa vikaas, jisaki madad se chal sainya kataren ek-duusare se sanchaar ke madhyam se judi rah sakati hai; or aadhunik dijal-electric pandubbiyon kaa nirmaan—ab bhi die jane baaki hai, haalanki inaki avadharana ek dashak se zyada puraani ho chuki he
 The Defense Ministry says this is because it still has to approve an important policy regarding strategic partnerships, which was proposed by a task force constituted by it in 2016
 ranneetik saajhedaari ke tahat raksha plateform, network, hathiyaar or saamagree ke vyapak kshetron main nijee kshetra kii companiyon or videshi saajheedaaron ke bich sanyukt upkram kaayam karne kii pariklpana kii gai he
 After circulating among defense ministry bureaucrats, the file has now been sent to the finance ministry to seek its opinion — a private sector CEO named "khanty Officer Tartamol"

 Another major obstacle in the "government's" Make in India "policy is the lack of orders given to the private sector
 kam-se-kam aise 10 prastaav jo arabon dollar ke hai or jinka uddeshy sena ko aadhunik inphantry combat vaahanon, sanvaar pranali, hovitger, helicopter or ladaaku jet se yukt karnaa he, ab bhi pipeline main hai
 The needs of the armed forces are very high

 This requirement has been stated to be around $ 100 billion during the next 15 years
 airo india main ek press conference main purv raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne kaha tha ki sanyabalon ko kareeb 400 ladaaku jet or 800 se 1,000 helicopteron kii jarurat agle ek dashak main padegi
 "in the next 10 years, we will need 5,000 chopper engines and we will also need 400 LCA engines (light combat aircraft)," he said
 
 
 
 All these open up huge possibilities
 " maamla yah he ki jab tak inke order nahin die jate, tab tak to ye sankhyaayein hawa main hi lataki rahengi
 There is a difference between the demand for military and the amount allocated in the defense budget presented on February 1, 2018
 darasal sena ne 37,121 karod ru
 Asked while he got 21,338 crores
 yani maang or aapurti main 15
 783 Rs
 kaa antar
 In such a situation, the question arises whether the dream of desiccation can be fulfilled with this budget
 bharat ke nijee kshetron ko raksha ke desi upkaran banane kya rakam muhaiyaa karvaa paaenge
 Will we touch on the 60% indigenization figure in the defense sector by the end of this tenure of the central government? a detailed report on this issue was published on 28 February 2017 from the Foreigner Title, Defense: Not Indigenous

 chhattisgarh ke sukama main congress kii parivartan raily thi
 Intelligence sources have revealed that the companions of barbaric Naxalite Pankaj alias Gaganna were already camping there for a week
 raily khatm hui
 As the convoy passed through the forest
 naklasiyon ne barudi surang main dhamaakaa karke use tham liya
 Then the bloody orgy of Naxalites lasted for two hours
 taarikh, 25 may 2013
 Day, Saturday
 vakt, dopaher ke 3:00 baje, jagah, sukama, chhattisgarh
 Congress' Parivartan rally was going on before the assembly elections in Chhattisgarh
 
 
 pradesh ke sabhi bade congressi netaa raily main maujuud the
 Unaware of the impending danger, all the people left Sukma in a convoy of about 20 vehicles after eating food
 khatra naksalihon ke hamale kaa
 In fact, the Naxalites had threatened the Congress and other parties not to hold such rallies
 lekin congress ne sukama main raily kii or raily khatm hone ke baad congress ke sabhi netaa or unke samarthak vahaan se jagadalpur ke liye nikle
 At around 4:15 pm, a convoy of 20 vehicles led by state president Nandkumar Patel reaches the forest in the most Naxal-affected Darbha valley
 kaafile main nandkumar patel kii gaadi ke aage do escort gaadiyaan chal rahi thi
 Unaware of this, there is a full web of death on the road ahead
 darasal naksaliyon ne raast main ek ped gira kar us puure jagah land mine bicha rakhi thi or puure ilaake ko gherkar kar usamen chhip kar unka intazaar kar rahe hai
 Then as soon as the vehicles running in the front of the convoy reached the fallen tree of Naxalites, the speed of the convoy stopped
 gadiyon ke rukate hi naksaliyon ne mins uda deen or uske baad ek jor kaa blast hua or donon gaadiyaan dhamaake main ud gayi
 Somebody now understands that the Naxals hiding in the forest started firing from both sides
 darasal kisi ne sapane main bhi nahin sochaa tha ki naksali itnaa bada hamalaa kar sakate hai
 After the blasts, there was chaos due to firing
 kisi ko kuch bhi nahin sujh rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, Congress state president Nandkumar got out of the car along with his son Dinesh Patel in the car
 udhar naksali donon taraf se maovadi zindaabad ke naare lagaate hue lagaataar firing kar rahe the
 However, security guards present in the convoy also responded to the firing of Naxalites
 lekin jald hi unki goliyaan khatm ho gayi
 Now Naxalites moved towards the convoy and started searching every vehicle
 halaat bigadate dekh nandkumar patel ne apane bete dinesh patel ke saath sarender kar diya
 He was accompanied by Sukma's MLA Kwasi Lakma
 unako sarender karte dekh naksali teenon ko pakad kar jangal ke kareeb 200 meter andar le gaye
 The Maoists first targeted the security guards present with the leaders and after killing them, around 100 Maoists started checking each vehicle
 us kaafile main congress party ke pradesh sachiv dow shiv narayan dvivedi bhi maujuud the
 During the shootout, he got down from his car and lay down on the ground
 unke saath maujuud unke teenon security guards maare ja chuke the
 Then Mahendra Karma sitting in the car behind him got down from the car and lay down beside him
 in donon ke saath congress kii purv emele phoolo devi bhi leti huin thim
 Actually, the Naxalites were looking for a special person and that person was former Chhattisgarh Home Minister Mahendra Karma
 jab unako pataa chalaa to unhone sarender kar diya
 As soon as they met Naxalites Mahendra Karma, Dr
 Shiva Narayan Dwivedi and other people took them inside the forest
 naksaliyon kii golibari main congress ke varisht netaa vidyacharan shukla bhi ghayal ho chuke the
 He was hit by three bullets
 naksaliyon ko golibari karte hue ek ghante bhi zyaada kaa vakt ho chukaa tha or naksaliyon ne jin logon ko bandhak banaaya hua tha unke liye ek-ek pal baari sabit ho rahaa tha
 Those who surrendered had little hope that the Naxalites might spare their lives, but then something happened that no one expected
 hamale se ghabaraae kaafile main maujuud sabhi bade netaa naksaliyon ke saamne sarender kar chuke the
 The Naxalites captured everyone and brought them with them into the forest
 unhone sabhi logon ko pet ke bal zamin par letne ke liye kaha
 Now they started questioning everyone
 is bich naksali congress pradesh adhyaksh nandkumar patel or unke bete dinesh patel ko pakad kar thodi dur le gaye
 He was accompanied by Sukma MLA Kwasi Lakma and then Naxalites shot and killed Nandkumar Patel and his son Dinesh Patel without saying anything but they left Kwasi Lakma
 itane katlogarat ke baad bhi shaayad abhi naksaliyon kaa dil nahin bharaa tha
 Now he started taking the name of Mahendra Karma
 mahendra karma ne khud apni pahchaan bataai to wo unako bhi apane saath pakad kar andar le gaye
 
 unki pahchaan hote hi naksaliyon ne unako dhamkee dete hue kaha kii wo pichhali baar unke hamale main batch gaye the or is baar unke bachane kaa koi chance nahin he
 After this, the Naxalites opened fire on them
 naksaliyon ne karma ke kareeb 50 goliyaan maari
 Not only this, he also celebrated his death after brutally killing Karma
 dow shivnarayan ke mutabik hamale main shaamil naksaliyon kii umr 20 se 25 saal ke bich thi
 The Naxalites were very happy on their success
 is bich naksaliyon ne congress ke bade netaaon ko chun chunakar maut ke ghat utaara
 Among them, former Congress MLA Uday Mudaliar was also killed
 is puure vaakye ke chashmadid rahe dow shivnarayan dvivedi kii baazuu main ek goli lagi thi or unki haath se koon tapakataa dekh ek naksali commander ne apane ek saathi se unako injection lagane ko kaha or unako pani bhi pilaayaa
 According to him, his convoy was attacked by about one thousand Naxalites
 naksaliyon ne bandhak banaae logon ko ye taakid bhi di ki agar bhavishya main dobaaraa aisa hamalaa hota he to wo haath upar kar len to naksali unki jaan nahin lenge
 Watch the game of luck Senior Congress leader Ajit Jogi narrowly survived the attack
 darasal unhen bhi is kaafile ke saath jagadalpur janaa tha
 But due to ill health he did not go and saved his life
 kareeb ek ghante tak chale is hamale main do darjan se zyada log maare gaye, jabaki 35 congress kaaryakarta or 19 jawan abhi bhi laapata hai
 As soon as the news of the attack was received, more than 6 thousand CRPF personnel have been sent to the area and search operation is going on in the forests and senior Congress leader Vidyacharan Shukla is fighting with life and death in Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon

 telecom mantralay ke upar desh main digital or anya sevaayen ko uplabdh karaane kii jimmedaari bhi he
 This statement by the telecom minister indicates that major changes can be made in the upcoming telecom policy
 jahaan maujuuda samay main telecom sector kii shikaayat he ki kendra sarkaar spectrum aavanton ke liye industry se levi or base price ke naam par bada rakam vasuul leti he

 Other sectors will also get the benefit of having Digital India ready

 One of the main reasons why the telecom industry is charging such a huge amount as tax for spectrum is currently 7 on telecom companies
 7 lakh karod rupee kaa karj boj he
 With this, the telecom companies claim that they have to pay 30 paise as tax for one rupee of the revenue earned from the telecom service
 kendriya mantri ne bataaya ki sarkaar march main desh kii nai telecom niti lekar aa rahi he
 The new policy will have several provisions to improve the health of the telecom sector

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is putting all its strength on that the 2019 election should be fought on the issue of chemistry ie face (modi)
 vajah saaf he ki ankaganit (vot aankade) bhaajapa ke paksh main banataa nahin dikh rahaa he
 Anyway, even when the 2014 elections were held, the BJP could not perform the miracle in terms of economic, which the face of Modi had created
 bhaajapa pichley loksabhaa chunaav main sirf 31 fisadi vot hi hasil kar pai thi
 This is also the party's real concern
 bhaajapa ke waar room main sakriy log jo aankade or mudde kii tah tak jaakar khojbin kar rahe hai
 Those people estimate that if the BJP loses 5-6 per cent of the votes compared to 2014, it will directly lose 100 seats
 1998 ke loksabhaa chunaav main bhaajapa ko 25
 59 per cent of the votes were received and the party got 182 seats
 jabaki 2014 main bhaajapa ko 31 fisadi vot hasil hue or party ne 282 siten jeet lee thi
 The second concern of the party is that if the economic is taken care of, then it is not guaranteed to have a full-fledged strategy on the chemistry (face)
 arthath bahumat se kam siten hasil karne par sarkaar dobaaraa bane hi isaki sambhaavna bhi kam hi he
 *** ajit pavaar (ajit Pawar) ko manaane kii sari koshishen ab tak naakaam rahi hai

 iske pehle ajit pavaar ko manaane kii koshish karne ke liye gaye ensipi ke nae vidhanmandal dal netaa jayant patil ko bhi khaali haath lautnaa padaa
 However, before going into the house, the lion had read that, '
 
 
 koshish karne waalon kii haar nahin hoti
 The NCP removed Ajit Pawar and elected Jayant Patil as the leader of the Legislature Party
 ajit pavaar to chup hai lekin bijepi unki niyukti kaa virodh kar rahi he
 Former minister and BJP leader Ashish Shelar held Jayant Patil's appointment as illegal in a press conference
 bijepi sutron kii maane to uskaa sara daaromadar ab ajit pavaar (ajit Pawar) par hi he
 Since he is the leader of the NCP Legislature Party and the party has not made anyone else the Chief Whip, then the order of Ajit Pawar will apply
 bahumat ke din agar ve bijepi ke paksh main mat dene kaa vip jari karte hai or agar maan bhi len ki unhen chhod saare vidhayak bijepi ke virodh main mat dete hai to us vip ko aadhaar banaakar vidhansabha adhyaksh sabhi kii sadsyta khatm karne kaa aadesh jari kar sakate hai
 If this happens, 53 out of 288 mlas will be reduced
 or bahumat sabit karne kii sankhya 145 kii bajaay 118 ho jaaegi
 The BJP has claimed to be around 120 with its 105 and 15 independents
 lekin abhi yah bijepi kaa ganit he

 kuch dinon pehle hi upi ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke twitor prem kaa majaak udaaya tha
 He had said that Modi is running his government on Twitter
 lekin ab akhilesh ke paas khud teen-teen twitor acounts ho gaye hai
 Earlier Akhilesh Yadav used to work with his personal Twitter handle @yadavakhilesh
 lekin bataur siem unhen mahasoos hua kii is kursi ke liye bhi alag se ek twitor acount to hona hi chahie
 So, on June 28, he started an account @cmofficeup
 phir upi sarkaar ke liye alag se @upgovt or rajya sarkaar ke mukhya sachiv ke naam se @chiefsecyup handles banaae gaye
 All three accounts were created in a single day
 haalanki, badaayun repakand par logon ko sambodhit karte hue akhilesh ne centre sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki 'dilli main baithi sarkaar twitor par hi desh chalaane main bharosa rakhti he'
 Akhilesh Yadav Principal Secretary Navneet Sehgal has argued that the cm's statement has been taken in the wrong context
 unhone jor dete hue kaha ki 'siem soshal media ke khilaaf nahin hai'
 On Yadav's Twitter entry, Sehgal said that an initiative has been taken to maintain transparency between the government and the public
 'ham aaj kii taarikh main soshal media ke mahatv ko samajhate hai'
 Read: Akhilesh Sarkar will proceed in the footsteps of Modi, however, unlike Narendra Modi, Akhilesh Yadav has instructed his ministers to stay away from social media
 is kaam ke liye upi sarkaar main ek khaas team bani he
 Whatever the ministers will have to convey to the people, it will be sent to this team first
 phir tamaam charchaaon ke baad mantri ji kii baat soshal media ke jariye logon tak pahonchegi
 Only last week, the team of Twitter India trained Akhilesh Yadav and his staff on this medium
 padhen: video conferencing ke jariye thanedaaron par najar rakhenge akhilettepane paanch saal puraane twitor acount se akhilesh yadav ne keval 135 twit hi kiye
 However, more than 24 tweets have been tweeted so far from these three new accounts
 inamen se zyaadaatar upi sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon se judi hai
 According to sources, the Akhilesh government needs some professional people who can run these three Twitter handles

 During the discussion in the Legislative Assembly, Home Minister Bala Bachchan said that he has called for information related to the pub game from the officials of the Home Department
 patrakaron ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue grahamantri bala bachchan se kaha ki philhal aisa koi prastaav nahin he ki is game ko madhya pradesh main bain kiya jaae
 Only after the full report comes, a decision will be taken
 kya he 'pabaji game'?aapako bataa den ki pabaji ek shooter oriented game he, jisamen 100 khilaadiyon ko ek tapu par chhod diya jaataa he
 They have to kill each other with guns
 duusare khilaadiyon ko maarthe hue or unase khud ko bachaate hue aakhri tak jo bachataa he wo game jeet jaataa he
 Police has been doing this to save school students from Awarepabji and other online games like this, in many cities of the country, police are going to school and telling children about its dangerous side effects
 iske saath hi abhibhavakon ko bhi jaagruk kiya ja rahaa he ki wo apane bacchon ko zyada se zyada samay den taaki bachche internet par zyada vakt naa bitaayen or online games kii lat se bache rah saken

 ise keval aadhi sachaai or asaty kaa mishran hi kaha ja saktaa he
 The spokesman said that Tata Sons has a strong business structure
 tata samooh kii kaary samskruti ke anuroop tata sans ne hameshaa hi company sanchaalan maamle main kanoon kii jarurat se upar jaakar kaam kiya he or vastav main is aupchaarik company sanchaalan dhaanche ko or majboot banaaya he
 Mistry, who was abruptly removed from the post of Tata Group chairman on October 24, had filed a petition in the NCLT on Tuesday urging the removal of the current board of directors of Tata Sons and the appointment of a retired Supreme Court judge as non-executive chairman
 tata sans ne is par apni pratikriya main daawa kiya ki unhone apane kaam-kaaj main karporate gavarnence ke ucch mandandon kaa paalan kiya
 According to him Tata Sons considers the petition unfortunate, which is a violation of the work culture of Tata Group and Jamsetji Tata by Mistry
 tippaniyan The statement said that Mistry had recently said that this was not a personal issue, despite stating that it was always a personal issue for him which conveyed deep acrimony against Ratan Tata

 It can only be called a mixture of half truth and untruth

 ) Exactly a month ago, on 2 July, the central government held a cabinet meeting to curb inflation and in a major decision announced that it would set its maximum stock limit to stop hoarding of potato and onion
 yani sarkaar aalu−pyaaz kii jamkhori kii paribhaasha tay karnaa chaahati or yah tab hogi jab ek hoseller yaa retailor apane paas kitni maatra main aalu-pyaaj rakh saktaa he yah tay ho, kyonki abhi tak fal−sabzi perishable camodity hai isliye ab tak in par kisi tarah kii stock limit lagu nahin thi
 It has been a month and till now only Madhya Pradesh has claimed that it will impose a stock limit for 3–4 months only on the onion, but it is also refusing to impose a stock limit on potatoes and the argument is As the prices of potatoes have remained stable in Madhya Pradesh in the last 4–5 years, there will be no such limit on potatoes
 jis dilli main kedra sarkaar ne mahinebhar pehle yah faisla kiya ki aalu−pyaaz par stock limit lagaai jaae, us dilli main bhi abhi is mudde par charchaa hi chal rahi he
 The traders of the country's largest Azadpur mandi, which is connected with the whole country, are telling that if there is a stock limit anywhere in the country, then they will first find out, so trade sources are saying that the stock limit is applicable in a month or so
 Has not happened khaadya mantralay ke paas bhi aisi koi jaankaree nahin, jisamen rajya stock limit lagane kii baat suchit kar rahe hon
 In such a situation, the question is, where is this whole matter going and what can happen next in the government's inflation stop plan
 jahaan tak meraa tajurba he, uske hisaab se centre sarkaar kahegi ki stock limit lagaana rajya sarkaar kaa kaam he or rajya sarkarein bhi stock limit lagu naa karne ke bahut-se kaaran ginava dengi or kahani yun hi chalati rahegi, jaisi saalon se chal rahi he
 a student of Rohilkhand University in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, with the help of his father, murdered his friend with sharp-edged weapons in a swift manner in connection with a case of abuse

 a Bareilly police official said that Najakat, a 30-year-old laborer living in Ejajnagar Gauntia of Baradari police station area, had a dispute over the transaction of money with his friend Arif
 isi ke chalate najaakat ne aavesh main aakar aarif ko gaaliyaan di thim
 The two quarreled over the abuses and reached Imambara where Arif's father Rashid was already present

 According to eyewitnesses, Najakat tried to escape by escaping himself, but Arif ran him and made several attacks on his back as well, causing Najakat to bloom and fall on the road there
 dindahaade hui is vaardaat se ilaake main sansani fail gai
 Sources said Arif and his father were caught by the people present on the spot and informed the family of Nazakat about the incident
 yuvak ko gambheer haalat main aspataal le jane kii koshish kii gai lekin usne raste main hi dam tod diya
 According to the police officer, the accused father-son has been arrested
 unke khilaaf baradari thane menhatyaka maamla darj kar karrwai kii ja rahi he
 BJP-AJSU will come together in Jharkhand, if the opposition is united in the field, then the bjp's equations will be spoiled
 bijepi ol jharkhand students union (ageesu) ke saath milakar 65 plus siten jeetne kaa target rakhaa he
 Whereas, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) -congress and RJD are preparing to join hands with each other
 aise main agar vipakshi khemaa milakar chunavi maidan main utarataa he to bijepi kaa un siton par siyaasi sameekaran bighad saktaa he, jinhen pichley chunaav main party ne maamuli se voton se jeeta tha
 Explain that out of total 81 assembly seats in Jharkhand, in 2014, BJP got 37 seats and its ally AJSU got 5 seats
 jabaki, jeemem 19 siten, congress 7 siten, jeviem 8 siten or 6 siten anya ne jiti thi
 Although the elections were contested by JMM and Congress separately
 bijepi ne 37 siten main se 13 siten aisi jiti thi, jahaan vipaksh dalon ke alag-alag chunaav ladane ke chalate use phayda mila tha
 bjp's Tala Marandi received 57,565 votes and jmm's Lobin Hembram 56,853 votes from Boriboria Assembly constituency
 is tarah se taala marandi ne mahaj 712 maton se jeet darj kiya tha
 While Manju Snehlata Hembram of Congress got 2,673 votes on this seat
 agar is baar ke chunaav main voting pattern vaisaa hi rahaa to bijepi ke liye yah seat jeetna aasaan nahin hoga
 Raj Palivar polled 74,425 votes from Madhupuramdhupur assembly seat
 jabaki jeemem ke haji hossain ansaari ko 67,441 vot mili the
 In this way BJP won this seat by 6,984 votes
 jabaki, is seat par congress ke faiyaz kaisar ko 8937 mat mili the
 In this way, if the Congress and JMM combine the votes of the candidates, it will not be easy for the BJP to win this seat
 rajamahalarajmahal se bijepi ke anant ojha ko 77,481 vot mili or jeemem ke mohammad tazuddin ko 76,779 vot mili the
 In this way, BJP won by just 702 votes
 jabaki, argedy ke arun mandal ko 5,175 mat mili the
 This time, if all three come together in the election field, it will not be easy for the BJP to feed the lotus here
 dumkadumka vidhansabha seat par bijepi kii louis marandi ko 69,760 mat mili the to jeemem ke hemanth sorenko 64,846 vot mil rahe hai
 In this way, BJP won this seat by 4914 votes
 jabaki, congress ke es murmu ko 3594 mat mili the
 If the opposition remains united then it will not be easy for the BJP to win the seat again
 gandayagandeya vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke jai prakaash verma ko 48,838 vot mili the to jeemem ke salkhan verma 38,559 mat mili the
 This seat was won by BJP by 10,279 votes
 jabaki is seat se congress ke sarfaraj ahamed ko 35,727 mat mili the
 If the voting pattern remains the same this time, then the BJP will miss out on winning this seat
 sisaisisi vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke dinesh uraanv ko 44,472 mat mili to jeemen ke jees horo ko 41,879 vot mili the
 In this way BJP won this seat by 2,593 votes
 jabaki, congress kii geethashri uraanv ne 26,172 vot hasil kiya tha
 In this way, if JMM and Congress combine the votes, it would have been difficult for the BJP to win the seat
 ghatshilaghatshila vidhansabha seat sebijapi ke lakshmana tudu 52,506mat paakar jeet darj kii thi
 Ramdas Soren of JMM received 46,103 votes
 is tarah se bijepi ne is seat ko 6,403 mato se kabja jamaaya tha
 Whereas, Cinderella Balmuchu of Congress had secured 36,672 votes
 is tarah se jeemem-congress is baar ekajute honge to bijepi kaa sameekaran bighad saktaa he
 bjp's Maneka Sardar won the Potkapotka assembly seat by winning 68,191 votes
 vahiin, jeemem ke sanjeev sardaar ko 61,485 vot mili the, is tarah unhen 6,706 maton se parajeet hona padaa tha
 Whereas, Dukhani Mai Sardar of Congress got 14,227 votes
 aise main agar congress-jeemem ko mili or voting pattern pichley chunaav jaisaa rahaa to bijepi ke liye dobaaraa se jeet darj karnaa mushkil hoga
 Shivshankar Oraon of BJP won the Gumlagumla assembly seat by winning 50,473 votes
 vahiin, jeemem ke bhushan tirki ne 46,441 vot hasil kiya tha
 In this way, BJP won this seat by just 4,032 votes
 jabaki, congress ke vinod kispotta ko 12,847 vot mili the
 If the opposition unites in the field in this election, it will be difficult for the BJP to feed the lotus on this seat
 jugslaijugsalai vidhansabha seat par bijepi ke sahyogi ageesu ke ramchandra sahis 82,302 vot mili the
 At the same time, Mangal Kalindi of JMM got 57,257 votes
 is tarah se jeemem ne 25,045 maton se haar gai thi
 However, Dulal Bhuiyan, who contested from the Congress on this seat, got 42,101 votes
 philhal dulaal bhuiyaan jhamumo main shaamil ho gaye hai
 If the JMM fielded the election, the winning equation of AJSU could get disturbed
 manikamanika vidhansabha seat par bijepi ke harikrishna singh 31,583 mat mili the to argedy ke ramchandra singh ko 30,500 seat mili the
 The BJP won this seat by 1,083 votes
 jabaki, congress ke muneshwar uraanv ko 27,731 vot mili the
 In such a situation, if the RJD joins the Grand Alliance with the congress-jmm, it will be difficult for the BJP to win this seat
 gadhwagadhwa vidhansabha seat se bijepi ke satyendra nath tiwari 75,196 mat mili to argedy ke girinath singh ko 53,441 vot mili the
 Thus BJP won this seat by 21,755 votes
 jabaki, jeemem ke mithilesh thakur ne 47,579 vot hasil kiya tha
 In such a situation, if the opposition is united this time, it will not be easy for the BJP to win this seat
 bagodarbagodar vidhansabha seat par bijepi ke nagendra mahato ne 74,898 vot hasil kiya tha to sipiai maale ke vinod singh ko 70,559 mat mili the
 In this way, BJP won this seat by 4339 votes
 jabaki jeemem ko 7,222 mat mili the
 In such a situation, if the ML is included in the Grand Alliance in this election's election, then the equation on this seat for the BJP can get worse

 ) maine or meri sikh patni ne vishesh vivaah adhinium, 1954 ke antargat aaj se 41 varsh pehle vivaah kiya tha
 Although the ceremony was concluded peacefully, but once i had to stop my laughter when i had to take an oath that 'I am not married to anyone else' according to my full knowledge and belief
 yadi yahi vivaah hamane varsh 1954 se pehle kiya hota, to ham donon ko vivaah kar paane se pehle apana-apana dharm tyaagna padataa
 In fact, before the year 1954, the Uniform Civil Code was available only to atheists and atheists, who had proved themselves by abandoning the religion of their ancestors
 varsh 1954 main yah sab badal gaya
 Through the Special Marriage Act, incorporated with the Indian Succession Act, 1925 (note the non-communal adjective 'indian'), we gave ourselves alternative equal civil codes 60 years ago
 phir bhi hamaare alpsankhyakon par anivaary samaan naagarik samhita (uniform civil code) ladane kii kasam khaae baithe modivaadi yah bataane kii krupa nahin karte ki unhone 60 saal se hamaare samvidhan main maujuud samaan naagarik samhita ko swayan aaj tak kyon nahin apanaaya he
 No, they still marry under Hindu law, and run their personal lives under the same Hindu personal law, which came into force in 1955 and 1956 after the Alternative Uniform Civil Code with three other laws came into effect Was
 or modivaadi un alpsankhyakon kaa mazaaq banaate hai, jo unke apane-apane personal lau ke sthaan par samaan naagarik samhita lagu karne kaa virodh karte hai
 What is this hypocrisy? 
 
 ? sirf muslimon kaa mazaaq udaane ke liye, yah daawa karne ke liye ki muslim sudhaar-virdohi hai, jabaki bahusankhyak pragatisheel hai
 No personal law is more progressive than the laws under which i married
 vah aisa nirnay tha, jo mujhe anichhaa se isliye karnaa padaa tha, kyonki mere pita dwaara banawaye gaye mandir ke pujaariyon ne vivaah sanskaar karwaane se is kaaran se inkaar kar diya tha, kyonki meri hone vaali vadhoo brahman nahin thi
 After that though he offered to get another priest to perform the marriage ceremony, who could do my work with some money, but i got angry, and i rejected that offer, and with the consent of his future wife, such a law Decided to get married under, which was modern and secular
 vah aadhunik, dharmanirpeksh kanoon uplabdh hone ke baavjood bahusankhyak samudaay ne apana personal lau kyon chunaa
 
 
 The Just because Hindu personal law is closer to the heart of Hindus
 aisi sthiti main, anya sampradaayon ke liye unke personal lau dil ke kareeb kyon nahin hone chahie
 
 
 The yah sach he ki hindu personal lau ko sansad ne taiyaar kiya he, jabaki shesh personal lau ko nahin
 But this happened only because Mahatma Gandhi had ensured that our freedom movement was not only liberated from foreign power, but also we could get rid of the terrible practices that were associated with the religion and culture of Hindus
 
 sansad dwaara samhita kaa banaaya janaa isliye sambhav ho paaya, kyonki vah swatantraaa sangharsh kaa bachaa hua kaam tha
 Long before independence, in 1941, the British Indian Government formed the Hindu Law Committee under the chairmanship of BN Rau, which took six years to complete its work, and submitted its report to the Constituent Assembly on the eve of Independence Day
 uske baad bhi aath saal kaa vakt phir liya gaya, or aakhirkaar varsh 1955 main hindu vivaah adhinium, 1956 main hindu uttaradhikaar adhinium, 1956 main hi hindu dattak-grahan tathaa rakrakhaav adhinium, tathaa 1956 main hi hindu alpsankhyak tathaa sangrakshan adhinium paarit hue
 Many amendments have been made since then, and will certainly continue to be done, due to which it can be considered as 'work in progress'
 so, yah aashaa karnaa ki anya sampradaay apane kanoonon main badlaav ke liye itnaa samay nahin lenge, vidweshpurn he
 It is also to be noted that only Hindu mps participated in the debates in Parliament on the Rau Committee's Hindu Code Bill, and Muslim, Christian and Zoroastrian communities had little or no participation, due to which non-hindus had their minds Came, and almost came right, that their laws are made and amended by Hindus, not by people of other sects
 to phir muslimon athwa anya gaiyr-hinduon ko gaiyr-muslim kyon bataaen ki unhen apane kanoon kaise sudhaarney hai
 Improvements are not easy
 raashtrapati dow rajendra prasad se lekar neeche tak ke hindu paramparawaadiyon ne ji-jaan se sudhaaron ko rokane kii koshish kii, or code main itani khamiyaan chhod deen ki hinduon main muslimon se bhi zyaada dwipatni vivaah tathaa bahupatni vivaah ke kisse saamne aae (1961 kii janaganana tathaa mahilaon kii sthiti par bani samiti kii 1974 main ai report)
 Further, as a result of an amendment made in the Hindu Marriage Act in the year 1964, now under the Hindu Divorce Act, a wife can be 'easily removed from her matrimonial residence if the husband says that her (husband's) marriage is broken' Already happened

 On June 29, 2014, BMMA co-founder Nur Jahan Safia Nawaz stated in a magazine of The Hindu that after consulting with thousands of women, mostly poor, settled in 10 states over a period of seven years, he gave a new Has prepared the 'muslim Marriage and Divorce Act'

 shivasena supremeo uddhav thakare ne bijepi ke is aarope kaa karaara jawaab diya he, jisamen kaha gaya ki uddhav kii siem banane kii mahatvakanksha kii vajah se gathbandhan tutaa
 Uddhav said that BJP also wanted the Chief Minister to belong to his party
 shivasena kii raily main uddhav thakare ne bijepi par palatwaar karte hue kaha, 'haa, main chahta hum ki mukhyamantri shivasena kaa ho, agar janata chaahe
 what's wrong with that? Did the BJP not want its CM? ”addressing his first rally on Saturday night after the alliance broke with the BJP on Thursday, Uddhav said he was not keen on the post of Chief Minister
 unhone kaha, 'lekin agar aap mujhe chunauti dene ja rahe hai, to main aapako dikhaaungaa ki main aapke garh main chunaav laduunga or mukhyamantri banuunga
 Uddhav said that BJP was also continuously seeking seats which have belonged to Shiv Sena for many years
 unhone sidhe-sidhe narendra modi ke khilaaf to kuch nahin bolaa, nahin bijepi par hamalaa kiya
 He questioned, 'maharashtra strongly voted for Modi in the Lok Sabha elections, but what did the Shiv Sena get in return?

 unhone daawa kiya ki bijepi ne pehle se hi gathbandhan ko todane kaa faisla kar rakhaa tha
 Uddhav said that as the chief of Shiv Sena, he tried to save the alliance till the end
 unhone kaha, 'main maharashtra se maafee maangata hum
 Uddhav Thackeray did not break the alliance
 maine aakhir tak gathbandhan ko bachaane kaa prayaas kiya
 He denied reports that he dismissed the existence of the Modi wave
 uddhav ne kaha ab hakeekat badal gai he
 He said, 'I never said that there was no Modi wave
 lekin aaj hakeekat alag he
 If there was really a wave, why did the recent by-elections result in inverted results? ”meanwhile, BJP President Amit Shah held a meeting with the state leaders of his party to discuss the election strategy

 ek baar phir jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 ko achaanak hataane ke modi sarkaar ke faisle se congress pashopesh main najar aa rahi he
 The Congress may have opposed the Modi government's move in Parliament, but there is confusion about it within the party, rather many leaders of the second line of the other party got a different stance
 bhale hi congress ne jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataane or jammu-kashmir punargathan bill kaa jamkar virodh kiya ho, lekin congress ke purv saansad deependra singh hooda or mumbai congress ke adhyaksh milind devda ne narendra modi sarkaar ke is faisle kaa samarthan kiya he
 Jourdan Dwivedi also supported the Modi government's decision on 370
 in netaaon kaa rukh bataata he ki congress main aise muddon par asamanjas kii sthiti bani hui he, or uske paas modi sarkaar ko gherne kaa abhi koi thos ranneeti nahin he
 Congress leader in the Rajya Sabha Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad logically opposed the dilution of Article 370, but did not get the support of other Congress leaders

 Since coming to the center in 2014, the bjp-led NDA government formed governments by winning elections in several states
 bijepi goa or manipur main sabase badi party nahin hone ke baavjood vahaan par sarkaar banane main kaamyaab rahi
 At the same time, it joined hands with the opposing party in Jammu and Kashmir to form the government for the first time in Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki bijepi kii aguai vaali endie ko dilli, bihar or punjab main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 If we look at all these elections, then the election of Bihar would seem to be similar to the present election held in Gujarat
 aaie jaanate hai ki aisi koun si baaten hai jo gujarat chunaav ko 2015 bihar chunaav ke kareeb le jaati hai
 1
 muddebihar or gujarat donon vidhansabha chunaav vikaas ke mudde se shuru hokar lade gaye
 In Bihar, Modi put forward his 18-month tenure and sought votes
 saath hi modi ne endie sarkaar kaa rodmap bhi logon ke saamne rakhaa
 At the same time, in Gujarat, PM Modi and Amit Shah also started the Gujarat election by presenting other figures related to the growth rate and development and sought votes
 2
 The political downfall of the parties, however, immediately led to a political debate in Bihar and Gujarat, moving away from development
 bihar main neeche girane kii had tak dien kii baat hone lagi
 The series began with Modi's statement on Nitish Kumar's political DNA
 iske baad nitish ke samarthakon ne bihar ke logon se baalo kaa sample laakar piemo ko bhejnaa shuru kar diya
 In Gujarat too, except for development issues, Congress started personal verbal attacks on PM Modi
 unhen chaay bechney vaala or neech kaha gaya
 At the same time, Congress President Rahul Gandhi was also asked to talk about his religion
 iske baad congress ne unhen janeudhari hindu bataaya
 The Congress also released pictures for this
 congress ne piem modi ke manishankar kii ghar par hue baithak ke sambandh purv piem manmohan singh par die gaye bayaan par virodh jataayaa
 3
 bahari kaa muddbihar or gujarat main ek cheez jo sabase zyada saamaan tha vah tha outsidar or local leader kaa mudda
 In Bihar, Nitish Kumar and RJD Lalu Prasad Yadav had raised this issue and attacked Modi and Shah with external speaking
 vahiin gujarat main bhi modi ne khud ko is mitti kaa betaa bataaya or rahul gandhi ko is mudde par target kiya
 4
 jatijaati raajnneeti kii baat karen to gujarat bihar jaisaa hi he
 The reversal of the caste-based vote by 14 percent affects the elections in both states
 yadav jahaan bihar main nirnaayak bhoomika main hote hai, vahiin gujarat main patel is role ko adaa karti hai
 Both castes are present in up to 14 percent of the population in their respective states
 jati aadhaarit group kaa bananaa or jeet main uski bhoomika ne bhi donon rajyon ke chunaav main kaaphi mahatvapurn role nibhaayaa
 Where Mahadalit, Muslim and Yadav coalitions won the victory of JDU and RJD
 vahiin gujarat main congress ne jati aadhaarit raajnneeti ko aage badhaayaa or patel or kshatriyon ko milakar paksh (paksh) banaaya
 The father of Bharatsinh Solanki of Gujarat Congress and former CM Madhavsinh Solanki had designed Kham in 1985
 khaam yani kshatriya, harijan yani dalit, adivasee or muslim
 This formula reduced the role of Patidars in the state
 isane kuch samay tak congress ko kaaphi phayda pahunchaaya
 In the leadership of Solanki, the party captured 149 out of 182 seats in 1985
 haalanki solanki ke is kadam se patidaar congress se hameshaa ke liye dur ho gaye or patidaaron kii madad se bijepi ne 1995 kaa chunaav jeeta or keshubhai patel bijepi ke pehle siem bane
 5
 siem kaa chehraadonon rajyon main ruling party ne apane mukhyamantri ke chehre ko pehle hi saamne rakh diya tha
 Where CM Nitish Kumar was the face of the Mahagathbandhan, the BJP in Gujarat has named Bijay Rupani for CM Face
 haalanki bijepi saath saath patel or patidaaron ko lubhaane ke liye dipti siem nitin patel kaa naam bhi leti rahi he
 Opposition parties have failed to give the Chief Minister's face before the elections in both the states
 bijepi or congress bihar or gujarat main kramash: apane siem kii ghoshnaa nahin kii thi
 6
 jeetavahin itani samaanat ke saath ek or samaan baat is chunaav se jud sakati he, vah he satta main maujuud party kaa dobaaraa jeetna
 Where the JDU retained power in Bihar
 agsit pole se yah sanket gujarat ke liye bhi mil rahe hai ki yahaan bijepi satta barkaraar rakh sakati he
 The results on 18 December will reveal whether there is another common factor in the elections of the two states

 Nidhi then fled to India with her son after saving her life
 phir nidhi ne apane bachche ko bharat main apane mata pita ke paas rakhaa or swayan jaise-taise padhai puri kar lee
 Later, he got an offer for a job in the US Department of Health
 yah khabar uske pati ravishankar ko hajam nahin hui
 Ravi Shankar implicated him in the legal process in the US by fleeing against his wife Nidhi for falsely accusing her of running away with his son, and the Devorce, after which the passport of her and her child was confiscated by the court
 america court ne bachche ko ek-ek haftaa ke liye baari-baari se maa or pita ke paas rakhane kaa aadesh diya he
 The physical and mental condition of the child and its mother is not well
 nidhi ke mata-pita or bhai ne pradhanmantri karyaalay or videsh mantralay main bhi guhaar lagaai he
 But they have not been heard yet

 Important changes made by the Union Cabinet The Union Cabinet has decided that the age limit of sex will be 18 years by consent
 ladki kaa peechha kiya janaa gaiyr-jamaanti aparaadh hoga, lekin sirf ghurne ke aarope main kisi ko giraftaar nahin kiya jayega
 Broadly, the consensus among the parties is that before this, the government called a meeting of all the parties to agree on the anti-rape bill
 is baithak main anti rape bill kii moti-moti baton par aam raay ban gai, lekin sahmati se sex kii umr ghataane ke mudde par kai partiyon ne etraz jataayaa
 Several parties, including BJP and BSP, had told the government that if the minimum age limit for girls to marry is 18 years, then the age of consenting for sex should not be 16 years

 The Congress has attacked the Modi government over the incessant rape incidents in Haryana and the infiltration of Chinese soldiers once again in Doklam
 congress netaa randeep surajevaala ne guuruuvaar subah press conference kar modi sarkaar par 7 sawaal daage
 He said that the information about the satellite images that have come out is with the government
 kya piem modi is baat ko sweekaarenge ki doklam par nayaa khatra khadaa hua he
 7 big questions from Congress's Modi government
 kya modi sarkaar or raksha mantralay ko jaankaree he ki doklam par china ne kabja kar liya he ? (satellite image ke mutabik)2
 Is the current situation that China has created in Doklam as per the india-china agreement of the Ministry of External Affairs on August 28, 2017? 3
 doklam main trijunction kaa masalaa bhavishya main kaise haal hoga ?4
 According to media reports, China in Arunachal Pradesh 1
 3 kimi andar road banaaya he
 Is this correct? 5
 kya narendra modi ye sweekaar karenge ki nayaa khatra doklam masale par khadaa ho gaya he?6
 External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had said that the issue would be resolved through dialogue
 doklam main nayaa ghatnakram kya ulanghan nahin?7
 According to his claim, what has the Modi government done so far to stop the infiltration? Apart from these questions, Surjewala attacked the BJP fiercely
 unhone AIMIM pramukh asaduddin ovaisi ko aade hathe lete hue kaha ki ovaisi bijepi kii bi team kaa hissaa hai, vah bijepi kaa vighatnkaaree agenda aage badhaate hai
 Therefore, his statements should not be shown in the national interest
 surajevaala ne siem yogi adityanath par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 He wrote that eclipse in the name of Adityanath development, children die due to lack of oxygen payment under the nose of the Chief Minister
 daliton ke makaanon ko aag laga di jaae or siem chup rahete hai
 Dalits get it by bathing them and applying perfume
 unka shashan kushasan ban chukaa he, unke shabdon ke koi myne nahin
 He also questioned the Haryana gang-rape
 He said that even today the gang rape incident occurred in Fatehabad, Haryana, the Chief Minister is only doing lip service
 unki sarkaar dilli baithkar haryana chalaanaa chaahati he, mukhyamantri ko bijepi adhyaksh or centre ke netaaon ke dilli main phere lagane se fursat nahin he
 Only the transfer of some officers will not stop the rape
 surajevaala ne aarope lagaaya ki gangrape main haryana sarkari aakandon main number ek par he
 Not only the Khattar government, the Center is also responsible because criminals use the haryana-delhi border

 Sallu Bhai is often in the headlines because of his comparisons with other artists
 lekin is baar to wo indian cricketer viraat kohli par bhi fabtiyaan kas baithe, kyonki viraat kaa mudi nechar unase mail khaataa he
 Due to this, he called Virat as 'metrosexual'
 salmaan khan haal hi main ek jewelri store ke launch ke liye dubai pahunche the
 During the press conference there was mention of cricket World Cup matches
 lekin jaise hi sallu bhai kii tulana viraat kohli ke saath unke good luks or mudi bihaviour ke liye kii gai, sallu bhai bayaan de baithe ki mujhe nahin lagata main viraat kohli kii tarah hum
 He is quite a metrosexual and i am not
 anoushka sharma ke boyfriend viraat ko unhone ek aisa ladkaa bataaya, jo apane luks ke liye bahut chintit rahata he or jise shopping karnaa pasand he
 Then he cleverly changed the topic and started talking about the goal of his personal life
 unke liye shaadi itani jaruri nahin he, jitani ki unki bacchon kii ichha
 Currently, Saman is India's most eligible bachelor and whenever he is questioned about his marriage, he defies him in jokes

 70 Total money spent (crores) karnataka main bijepike andar baghawat somvaar ko ek bade hangaame kii shakl le sakati he
 State Assembly session begins on Monday
 baagi to naaraaz hai hi, vipaksh ko bhi ab mudda mil gaya he
 In such a situation, there can be a ruckus in the assembly to put pressure on the government
 karnataka main camel kii satta kii agnipariksha kaa din aakhir aa hi gaya
 bjp's rule has seen the curve of former chief minister of his own party, Yeddyurappa
 or loktantr ke aankadon main ab sawaal shettar kii satta ganit par khadey ho gaye
 And the whole work of multiplication of this math is to be done in the assembly
 bijepi kii andruni khinchataan main yediurppa ke samarthan vaale 14 vidhayakon ne ab tak istipha de diya he
 The speaker has accepted the resignation of 13 of them
 haalanki karnataka ke rajyapal kaa kahana he ki unhen kisi bhi siyaasi sankat kii koi bhi aupchaarik jaankaree nahin he
 Today, his agenda is only to address the joint session of the Karnataka Legislative Assembly
 vaise, aankadon ke khel ko agar dekhen, to badale halaat main bhi jagadish shettar kii kursi par koi bada khatra nahin dikh rahaa he
 The BJP previously had 119 mlas in the 225-member Karnataka Legislative Assembly
 bahumat ke 113 ke aankade se kahin zyada
 Now that 14 mlas have resigned, the majority figure in the house has also come down
 bijepi ke paas apane vidhayakon ke saath-saath 1 nirdaleey kaa bhi samarthan he
 Meaning the figure is also with the BJP government in the competition of thorns
 shaayad aankadon kii isi badhat kii vajah se karnataka ke mukhyamantri jagadish shettar baar-baar apni kursi ke surakshit hone kaa daawa kar chuke hai
 Even though Shettar finds his chair safe
 lekin karnataka kaa siyaasi naatak thamanevaala nahin he
 The rebels of the BJP are also sitting, the Congress and JDS are also ready in the opposition
 matlab ye ki vidhansabha main hangaame ke asaar to he hi
 The biggest concern for the BJP is also to preserve its power in this year's assembly elections

 co / aar5kpyv0v— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi)may 20, 2016 Often you have seen three lines made of sandalwood or ash on the foreheads of saints or ascetics, pandits
 ye koi saadhaaran rekhaaen nahin hai balki inhen tripund kaha jaataa he
 Know what is the three lines made of sandalwood or bhasma on the Tripundamathe is called Tripunda
 chandan yaa bhasma dwaara teen unguliyon kii madad se tripund banaaya jaataa he
 27 Gods reside in the three lines of Tripunda
 prayek rekha main 9 devataaon kaa vaas hota hai
 Shiva has special blessings on those who wear Tripunda
 jarur jaayen mumbai sthit shri siddhivinayak mandirsharir ke 32 angon main laga sakate hanye vichaar man main naa rakhen ki tripund keval maathe par hi lagaaya jaataa he
 Tripunda is applied on a total of 32 organs of the body because the effect and importance of Tripunda applied on different organs is also different
 in angon main mastak, lalaat, donon kaan, donon netra, donon kohni, donon kalai, hryday, donon pashrv bhaag, naabhi, donon ghutane, donon pindli or donon pair shaamil hai
 In which part of which god was the habitat of the gods in every part of the habitat
 mastak main shiv, kesh main chandramaa, donon kaanon main rudra or brahma mukh main ganesh, donon bhujaaon main vishnu or lakshmi, hryday main shanbhu, naabhi main prajapati, donon uruon main naag or nagkanyaayein, donon ghutanon main rishi kanyaayein, donon pairon main samudr or vishaal pushmbhag main sabhi tirth devtaa rup main rahete hai
 Do VIP culture at the rate of Baba Vishwanath, for 3100 rupees a year, without lines, ash of Darshanabhasam and Tripundabhasam burnt items is ash but all the ashes are not usable as ash
 bhasma ke taur par unheen raakh kaa prayog karnaa chahie, jo pavitra kaary ke liye kiye gayi havan yaa yajna se praapt ho
 What the Shiva says According to the Puranasiva Purana, a person who regularly holds three lines from one end of his head to the other end of the Bhasma on his forehead, all his sins are destroyed and the person becomes the object of Shiva's grace
 naukari nahin mil rahi to ye upaay karenge madadvigyaan bhi maanata he phydemandatripund chandan yaa bhasma se lagaaya jaataa he
 Sandalwood and ash provide coolness to the forehead
 adhik maansik shram karne se vichaarak centre main pidaa hone lagati he
 In such a situation, Tripund gives coolness to the fibers of knowledge
 isse maansik shanti milti he
