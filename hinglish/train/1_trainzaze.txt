 For a long time it was being discussed that Digvijay Singh, National General Secretary and Rajya Sabha member of Congress, should leave Rajgarh and contest elections from Bhopal
 shanivaar der raat ko is baat par muhar lag gai he
 Earlier, Digvijay had contested the elections in 2003 Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly

 com / iefj0oci43— ANI (@ani)march 23, 2019rajyasabha saansad evam madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri digvijay ne indore main samvaadadaataaon se charchaa karte hue kaha tha ki vaise to 2020 tak meraa rajyasabha kaa time he, lekin phir bhi party chaahati he ki main loksabhaa main jaaun
 By the way, my first priority is right in the Rajgarh parliamentary seat, where i am also a voter but despite that i have told the party president (rahul Gandhi) and the state Congress president and the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath that i will contest from where the party wants to contest
 Will fight digvijay singh ne aage kaha ki jahaan se congress adhyaksh kahenge vahaan se (loksabhaa chunaav) lard luungaa, lekin laduunga jarur
 Digvijay said that i have always accepted challenges in life and it is in my habit to accept challenges
 isliye mujhe koi dikkat nahin he
 Significantly, the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath had said in a statement that Digvijay Singh should contest on one of the hard seats, of which Bhopal was also one
 jyotiraditya sindhiya ne bhi is baat kaa samarthan kiya tha
 On this, Digvijay Singh gave his reply on Kamal Nath's statement
 digvijay ne ek ke baad ek do twit kiye
 In the first tweet, he thanked Kamal Nath and wrote 'thank you to Kamal Nathji who invited him to fight on weak Congress seats in Madhya Pradesh
 unhone mujhe is laayak samajha main unka abhaari hum'
 However, in the subsequent tweet, Digvijay wrote sarcastically that it is his habit to accept the challenge
 digvijay ne likhaa ki 'main raghogarh kii janata kii krupa se 77 kii janata party lahar main bhi ladakar jitkar aayaa tha
 It is my habit to accept challenges
 jahaan se bhi mere netaa rahul gandhi ji kahenge main lok sabha chunaav ladane taiyaar hum
 Narmade Hara '
 is duusare twit ko kataaksh isliye kaha gaya kyonki mana ja rahaa he ki sabase kathin siton par chunaav ladane kii salaah dekar kamalnath ne digvijay ke saamne badi chunauti rakh di thi lekin digvijay ne badi hi shaleenta se iskaa jawaab de diya
 Let me tell you that the discussion of Digvijay Singh contesting Lok Sabha elections from Rajgarh was in full swing because it is considered to be the stronghold of the Congress but in the 2014 Modi wave, the lotus bloomed here
 khud digvijay singh yahaan se chunaav jeet chuke hai lekin kamalnath chaahate hai ki digvijay singh us seat se chunaav laden jahaan congress lambey arase se nahin jeet pai he

 unhone kaha ki police ke sheersh adhikari ke naak ke neeche jab log surakshit nahin hai, to phir or jagahon kaa kya haal hoga, isi se samajha ja saktaa he
 The year 2017 is about to end
 is saal main desh kii raajnneeti main kai tarah kii uthal-puthal hui
 Governments changed in many states, many leaders changed the party and the politics of accusation continued
 isi saal kai netaaon ne baghawat kaa rasta bhi chunaa or apni party yaa phir netaa ke khilaaf hi morcha khol diya
 This not only damaged the party's image, but also affected their own political life
 is saal main aise se hi sabase bade baagiyon par ek nazar daalate hai

 sharad yadav (janata dal (you), bihar)jepi andolan se raajnneeti main entry karne vaale sharad yadav saal ke sabase bade baagiyon main se ek rahe
 Today the party he formed is out of that
 bihar main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar ke tuutane ke baad mukhyamantri or maujuuda party adhyaksh nitish kumaar ne bhartiya janata party kaa daaman tham liya
 Sharad Yadav opposed this, now that the party's maximum leader, MLA, MP was in favor of Nitish Kumar
 isliye sharad yadav kii nahin chali
 After this Sharad also participated in a joint opposition rally called by Lalu Yadav
 party main baghawat kaa nuksaan sharad yadav ko apni rajyasabha kii seat ganvaa kar chukaana padaa
 Seeing Sharad's rebellion not loosen up, the party demanded the cancellation of his Rajya Sabha membership, which was also approved
 haalanki, vah ab isko lekar kanoonee ladaai ladane kii taiyaari main hai
 Apart from Rajya Sabha, Sharad had also tried to assert his right over the party, in which he was supported by another rebel leader of the party, Ali Anwar
 is dauraan rajd pramukh lalu prasad yadav, congress se bhi sharad yadav ko samarthan miltaa rahaa
 However, in this too, Sharad was disappointed with the Election Commission
 ayog ne nitish kumaar kii party ko hi asli jedy(you) mana or party kaa chunaav chinh tir bhi nitish ke hawaale hi kiya
 Ever since JD (U) was formed, Sharad has been its top leader
 lekin ab samay badal gaya he
 How Sharad Yadav advances his political innings in 2018 will be something to see

 Kapil Mishra (aam Aadmi Party, New Delhi) If it is the talk of the year's rebels, then how can former Delhi Water Minister Kapil Mishra be forgotten
 kapil mishra ne party chhodte hi sansani failaa di thi, lagaataar press conference, khulaase, dharna, anshan
 He fiercely attacked Delhi Chief Minister and AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia
 darasal, kapil mishra kaa baagi rukh tab saamne aayaa jis samay arvind kejariwal ne unhen jalmantri ke pad se hataa diya tha
 After which Kapil Mishra accused Arvind Kejriwal of taking 2 crore rupees in Delhi government, minister Satyendra Jain
 aaropon ke baad kapil kii party kii sadsyta radd kar di gai thi
 Kapil Mishra did not stop here, he also sat on hunger strike against the party
 anshan ke dauraan bhi kapil mishra ne dilli sarkaar par sawaalon ko daagna jari rakhaa
 Kapil Mishra accused the trend of corruption in the Aam Aadmi Party
 unhone us dauraan 5 logon kii yatra kii ditels maangi thi
 Kapil made public the details of the foreign visits of five AAP leaders Sanjay Singh, Ashish Khaitan, Satyendar Jain, Raghav Chadha and Durgesh Pathak
 haalanki, aam aadmi party kii ore se kapil mishra ke har aarope ko jhootha kaha gaya
 Even after this, Kapil Mishra raised questions about the party's funding scandal, the water scam in the government

 Yashwant Sinha (bharatiya Janata Party, former Union Minister) There is bound to be opposition in politics, but when someone opposes it, it is quite a shock
 shaayad kuch aisa hi bhartiya janata party main hua tha
 In the middle of the year when the country's economy was staggering, an article by Yashwant Sinha, veteran leader of the party and a minister in the Atal government, shook the entire government
 sinha ke lekh ke jawaab dene maano pradhanmantri, vittamantri samet kai kendriya mantriyon ne qatari laga di
 On the questions asked about Yashwant Sinha's economy, where the government and the party were on the backfoot
 to duusari taraf vipaksh is par tali peet rahaa tha
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi had supported his questions during campaigning in Gujarat assembly elections
 sinha ke sawaalon ke baad jo jubaani tir chale unka dhyaan sabhi ne khinchaa
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said in response to Sinha's questions that at the age of 80 people are trying to find jobs
 jisase sinha tilamila uthe the, unke samarthan karne waalon main party ke duusare bade netaa shatrughna sinha or arun shouri ne kiya tha
 Prime Minister Modi also gave the example of surgery of Mahabharata in a program on Sinha's questions
 haalanki, piem modi ne kisi kaa naam nahin liya tha, lekin us dauraan kii paristhitiyon ko dekhakar andaja lagaaya ja saktaa tha ki nishaanaa kis ore tha
 In response to Modi's action, Yashwant said that he is Bhishma, he will not allow the economy to rip
 aapako bataa den ki jab vikaas dar (GDP) 5
 After reaching 2 percent, Yashwant Sinha attacked the government after opposition
 haalanki, abhi party main yashavanth sinha ke paas koi khaas pad nahin he
 Therefore, in the coming year, there will be an eye on how Yashwant Sinha's attitude will be for the government and the party
 chunki vah party main akele nahin hai, shatrughna sinha, varun gandhi or arun shouri jaise netaa bhi unki jaisi bhashaa bolte aae hai

 shahzad poonawala (bhartiya rashtriya congress)saal kaa ant hote-hote congress main bhi baghawat kii bu aa hi gai thi
 During the election of the party president in November, when Rahul Gandhi was elected president, it was almost certain that youth leader Shahzad Poonawala gave a rebel note
 unhone kaha ki ye koi ellection nahin balki sillection ho rahaa he
 On which the uproar had arisen
 haalanki, congress ne kaha tha ki poonawala ke bayaan ko zyada tarjeeh dene kii jarurat nahin he
 But while the election campaign in Gujarat was at its peak, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also patted Shehzad during a rally
 unhone raily main kaha ki ek yuva netaa ne party adhyaksh chunaav par sawaal kiya to use chup kara diya gaya
 After praising the PM, Poonawala also thanked him
 yun to poonawala party main kisi bade pad par nahin the, lekin ve aksar tivi channelon par party kii ore se dibet karte hue dikhte the
 Apart from this, he also has a relationship with Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra
 robert wadra kii bahan kii shaadi shahzad ke bhai tahseen poonawala se hui he
 After Shahzad's rebellious remarks against Rahul Gandhi, Tehsin Poonawala refused to maintain any kind of relationship with him
 vaise poonawala ke baagi tewaron kaa koi khaas asar nahin hua tha
 In the end, Rahul Gandhi became the president of the party, but raising his voice remained a topic of discussion in politics for a few days

 The Central Government and the Supreme Court have come face to face in the matter of appointment of judges in the High Court
 is maamle main supreme court ne centre sarkaar ko kadi fatkaar lagaai
 The Supreme Court said that administrative apathy is spoiling this institution
 aaj halaat ye hai ki court ko taala lagaana padaa he
 The court said that the entire ground floor in the Karnataka High Court is closed
 kyon naa puure santhaan ko taala laga diya jaae or logon ko nyaay dena band kar diya jaae
 Chief Justice TS Thakur said that the central government should not make this issue an issue of Ego
 ham nahin chaahate ki halaat aise hon ki ek santhaan duusare santhaan ke aamane-saamne hon
 There should be an effort to save the judiciary
 chif justise thakur ne kaha, ham bade sabar se kaam kar rahe hai
 The central government should tell what happened to the list of judges of Allahabad High Court
 sarkaar 9 maheene se is suchi par kyon baithi he? agar sarkaar ko in naamon par koi dikkat he to hamen bhejein, phir se vichaar karenge
 On behalf of the central government, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said, there are many names in the list of judges of the High Court which are not correct
 sarkaar ne 88 naam tay kiye, lekin sarkaar emopi taiyaar kar rahi he
 Now the next hearing of this case will be held on 11 November

 tippaniyan The court had said that the collegium had sent a list of 75 people for appointment of judges to the High Court in February, but the Center has not done anything yet
 supreme court ne kaha tha ki ham aise halaat nahin hone de sakate, jahaan court ke band hone kii naubat aa jaae
 The government should tell where the list files are
 
 
 ? aapako kuch naamon par dikkat he to waapas bhejie, collegium phir se dekhegaa
 There should be some accountability of the government
 gauratlab he ki farvari main hoicourt ke chif justise ke transfar kii list bheji gai, lekin sarkaar ne kuch bhi nahin kiya
 In fact, the Supreme Court is hearing a public interest litigation in which the court has demanded action on pending cases
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki lau kamishan kii us report ko lagu kiya jaae, jisamen jajon kii sankhya badhaane ko kaha gaya tha

 The system of employment generation is not yet being established in India

 Rahul said that India has a history that it has a well-coordinated relationship with all countries
 unhone kaha ki america ke saath samrik sambandh mahatvapurn hai, lekin baaki desh bhi hamaare liye kaaphi mahatvapurn he
 In this case, it should be made better with them
 kaaman civil code ko court par chhodamodi sarkaar ke aane ke baad kaaman civil code kii baat uthi he
 While some religious organizations are concerned about this, some believe that it should be implemented, that there should be a law for all
 rahul ne kaaman civil code ke sawaal par kaha,'' main ise adaalat par chodta hum nyaayalay kaa jo bhi faisla hoga wo mujhe maanya hoga

 ashishnutaa ko lekar kya desh main vaaki halaat itane kharaab ho chuke hai ki ab videshi jameen se is mudde ko uthaae jane kii jarurat pard gai
 Rahul wants to put the Modi government in the loop on the pretext of intolerance

 Grateful nation remembered him on the 142nd birth anniversary of Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on Tuesday
 sardaar patel kii viraasat ko lekar raajnneetik ghamaasan ke bich unke desh ke pehle pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru ke saath lekar rishton kaa zikr bhi aksar hota he
 In 1947, when Nehru Azad became the first Prime Minister of India, Sardar Patel got the important position as Home Minister, it is very interesting to know the story of the relationship between Nehru and Sardar Patel, when differences between the two increased so much that both of them resigned Was offered to give vivaad itnaa bad gaya tha ki donon ne mahatma gandhi se kah diya ki ab unka ek duusare ke saath kaam kar paanaa mumkin nahin he
 This incident is in December 1947, a few weeks before Gandhi's assassination
 desh main kai jagah sampradayik dange bhadke hue the
 Despite all the efforts of Prime Minister Nehru and Home Minister Sardar Patel, the situation was not completely under control
 rajasthan kaa ajmer bhi isi tarah sampradayik dangon kii aag main jhulas rahaa tha
 a few days ago there was a big communal riot
 maamle kii tah tak jane ke liye grih mantri patel ne grih mantralay kii taraf se ek jaanch dal ko vahaan bheja tha
 Meanwhile, Prime Minister Nehru announced that he himself would go to Ajmer in late December to see the situation
 patel ko yah baat acchhee to nahin lagi lekin nehru kaa lihaaj karte hue wo chup rahe
 But just before the Ajmer visit, Prime Minister Nehru announced that now he will not go to Ajmer but instead will go to his personal secretary Ajmer
 sardaar patel ko yah baat bahut nagavar gujri
 He felt that when the Home Ministry's inquiry committee had already gone to Ajmer, the Prime Minister's sending his personal secretary there meant that he did not trust the work of the Home Ministry
 louh purush sardaar patel bhala kahaan chup rahane vaale the! unhone sidhe nehru se is bare main aapatti jataai or kaha ki agar vah khud ajmer jate to baat or thi lekin apane personal secretary ko vahaan bhejne par unhen sakht aapatti he
 Despite differences with Patel on many matters, Nehru respected him very much
 unhone patel ko samajhane kii koshish kii
 It is said that due to the death of someone in the family, he cannot go to Ajmer himself
 unhone daleel di ki vah apane secretary ko ajmer isliye bhej rahe hai kyonki jo log unase milane kaa intjaar kar rahe the wo maayoos naa ho
 But at the same time Nehru also said that the Prime Minister is the head of the government and can go wherever he wants and whom he can send wherever he wants
 nehru kii is baat par patel bhadak gaye
 He told Nehru that in a democracy, the Prime Minister is not the biggest, but only among the people of 'first Among the Equals'
 patel ne yah bhi kah diya ki loktantr main pradhanmantri se yah ummid nahin kii jaati ki vah apane mantriyon par apana hukum chalaaegaa
 The controversy over Nehru sending his secretary to Ajmer went on increasing
 baat itani bighad gai ki nehru or patel donon ne mahatma gandhi se kaha ki vah ek duusare ke saath kaam nahin kar sakate or apana istipha dena chaahate hai
 Mahatma Gandhi told both of them that they would talk to both of them on this matter and at the moment both of them keep doing their work because the country needs them
 nehru or pateldonon gandhi ke saath baithkar is maamle par baatcheet karne kaa intjaar karte rahe
 But there was no chance that the three people could interact together
 pehle patel ko kuch dinon ke liye dilli se baahar janaa padaa or uske baad gandhi anshan par baith gaye
 When the opportunity came to sit and talk with the three, Gandhi was killed on the same day
 30 janvari 1948 ko mahatma gandhi ne dilli main shaam ko apni prarthana se pehlesardaar patelko baatcheet ke liye bulaayaa
 Both Gandhi and Patel were from Gujarat and the relationship between them was very intimate
 donon aksar gujarati main baat karte the
 He explained to Patel that there are many challenges before the country, it is necessary for Nehru and him to work together
 unhone patel se kaha ki ve agle din nehru ko bulaakar saath baithkar baatcheet karenge taaki yah vivaad hameshaa ke liye khatm ho sake
 But this meeting of Gandhi, Nehru and Patel could never take place
 kyonki usee din yani 30 janvari 1948 kii shaam ko prarthana sabha ke samay nathuram godse ne goli markar gandhi ji kii hatya kar di
 But Gandhiji's sacrifice did not go in vain
 gandhi kii hatyake teen din baad jawaharlal nehru ne vallabh bhai patel ko patr likhakar kaha ki gandhiji ke nahin rahane ke baad ab paristhitiyaan bahut badal gayi hai or ab puraane vivaad bhul kar hamen saath kaam karnaa hoga kyonki desh ke saamne bahut badi chunautiyaan hai
 Showing an equally large heart, Sardar Patel wrote to Nehru that literally everything has changed with the assassination of Gandhi
 patel ne kaha ki yah baat sahi he ki haal ke kuch vivaadon se vah bahut pareshaan the or apana istipha dene kii peshkash bhi kar chuke the
 But now he is ready to put his full strength shoulder to shoulder with Nehru to face the challenges facing the country under new circumstances

Light gray hair, strange golden hair, springs of silk, like sizzling with the stench of a blemish, the delicate thirst of dryness on the lips of the Egyptian! How beautiful you look when you become sad! The whirlpools descend
 Bowing down in the sky, i am asking, "what is the matter? Why is the rainy friend lying in the core of the eyelid eyed? Why does the Champai fly away by touching the chest of saffron? How beautiful do you look?"

 Of those involved in the Third Front, 12 want to become pms

 We have come to form a progressive government, it is not just our objective to form a government

 He said that there is a government in Delhi, died in hospital, and running on the support of oxygen, it should be liberated

 They should write something
 bihar kii janata jangalraj se mukti chaahati thi
 Today there is Jungle Raj in the whole country, whose removal should start from Bihar
 bihar main aaj vot bank kii raajnneeti main duube netaa hai
 These people are also working to destroy the generations to come
 bihar main 1900 aise skool hai, jinka kharchaa ho rahaa he, lekin vaastaviktaa main aise skool hai hi nahin
 
 
 
 in kagaji skulon se bihar kaa bhavishya nahin banegaa

 aane vaala yug takanic kaa he
 One should get good education from childhood
 bihar main maatr do pratishat skool hai, jahaan computer hai
 What are you doing, what is Shahzade of Delhi doing, his minister, who was claiming that all the youth of the country would have Akash tablet in their hands
 modi ne poocha ki yah akaash se jameen par kab aayega
 Seven percent of schools in Assam, 40 percent of schools in Haryana, 45 in Maharashtra and 22 percent in Rajasthan have computers
 bharat main skulon main computer kaa ausat 22 pratishat he
 Gujarat, which is being maligned, which is being whipped, 71 percent of the schools there have computers
 aane vaali peedi ke bhavishya kii chintaa he hamen
 He attacked the Congress government claiming that we brought IT, but where did it go
 
 
 kahaan tak laae
 
 
 The bihar main jute kii kheti ko barabaad kar diya gaya he, lekin yahaan ke netaa lut main maahir ho gaye hai
 Modi praised the Yaduvanshi people very much
 uttar pradesh main ek saal pehle doodh ke daam pashupalkon ko 18 rupee miltaa tha, lekin vahaan amul ke bhejte hi doodh ke daam 35-40 tak pahunch gaye
 The government there could not do such work
 unhone kaha ki puraane netaaon ko chhodon unhone kisaanon ko, pashupalkon ko barabaad kiya he
 Modi said that despite having so much water here and despite the large number of fishermen, the government is indifferent to them
 yahaan 400 karod kii machhlee andhra pradesh se aati he

 unhone spasht kar diya he ki hamaari sarkaar purvi ilaake ke vikaas kaa vishesh dhyaan rakhegi taaki pashchimi rajyon ke baraabar aa saken
 Modi said that the arrogance of the CM here is hindering the development of Bihar
 unhone kaha ki netaa ke ahankaar ne kosi ke kahar ke dauraan gujarat kii madad ko waapas kar diya tha
 He said that in democracy, people do not forgive arrogance
 unhone kaha ki agar dilli main banane vaali bhaajapa kii sarkaar bihar ke liye kuch kaam karti he to kya aaj ke siem vah kaam sweekaar karenge
 He said that Nitish Kumar, who had sinned by returning help, today apologize for it

 modi ne kaha ki sachhar cameti kii report kahati he ki bihar main shahari musalamaanon main 45 pratishat garib hai, lekin gujarat main maatr 24 pratishat
 While 38 percent of the rural Muslims are poor, in Gujarat this figure is only seven percent
 gujarat kaa secularism sachcha secularism he, jo sabakaa vikaas karata he
 Modi told the people with the help of all the figures, how much difference is there between the Muslims of Bihar and Gujarat? unhone bihar ke logon se kaha ki is kuchakr se baahar nikliye or vikaas ke raste par chalem
 He said that unity in diversity is our mantra
 yahi bharat kii visheshta he
 After the family, people often find peace between friends
 dosti kabhi or kahin bhi ho sakati he iskaa koi thor-thikaana nahin hota he lekin bachapan kii dosti kaa koi tod nahin hota he
 Some friends are always together, some are separated forever and sometimes they become friends who are better off in life
 tabhi to kehete hai dost jitne kam unte hi achche or agar aap un logon main se hai jo har kisi se dosti kar lete hai to aapako neeche di gai kuch baton par dhyaan dena chahie kyonkihar ek dost jarurinhin hota he
 
 
 1
 dosti kaa ek usul he ki isamen koi rule nahin hota he
 That is why this relationship is most special, but now it does not even mean that you should befriend everyone
 2
 It is also important to be careful while choosing your friends because sometimes friends also become the junk of life
 3
 If you have some special friends from childhood or college, keep them special so that your privacy remains
 4
 Friends are made anywhere but it does not mean that you bring everyone to your home
 5
 Friendship is a good thing, but it does not mean that if you get friends, you forget old friends
 6
 Nowadays it is common to have friendships on social networking sites too, but it is also important to take care of safety and security before pursuing such friendship
 aksar aise rishton main log dhokh kha jate hai
 7
 saath hi dosti ke chakkar main padakar apni family or kariyar ko kabhi bhi ignor na karen
 Friends should be few but it is very important to be good and reconciled

 Keeping this in mind, NSG has now incorporated ballistic helmets or, say, bullet proof helmets into its body gear to deal with such situations
 vaise dikhne main ye helmet bada aam sa dikhataa he lekin kamaal kaa he
 Its front cover and base can withstand up to 9 mm bullet
 is nae helmet ko is tarah se dizin kiya gaya he ki chaahe jitne close range se hi kyon naa goli chalaai jaae ye use jhelane main kargar he
 These helmets fulfill the global standard
 saath hi ye helmet pahanane main suvidhajanak hai or inamen sanchaar upkarnon ko bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In this regard, a senior officer of NSG told NDTV India, "no matter how close the bullet is fired, if a soldier is wearing this helmet, then there will be no injury to his head
 is helmet main koi nat nahin he
 It weighs two and a half kilos
 " According to him, in any anti-terror operation, the body gear of commandos is about 28 kg
 ab usamen do kilo kaa or izaafaa ho jayega
 In this case, one of the commandos associated with such an anti-terror operation says, "it is very important that your head is protected
" jab goli chal rahi hoti he to wo kahin bhi hit kar sakati he
 Earlier we used to save our heads but now our safety has also increased with this helmet
 " The best thing is that it is being made in India itself and the cost of a helmet is around 6500 rupees
 iske saath hi ek varisht afasar kaa kahana he,"abhi hamane apni kuch tukadiyon ko ise dena shuru kiya he
 " isse pehle jo helmet enesji ke commando pahante the uskaa sheesha bulatopruf nahin tha jiske kaaran splinter lagane se wo chur ho jaataa tha or jawaano kii aankh main chot lag jaati thi
 Then the soldiers started wearing bulletproof slabs which protected only his forehead and not the head
 tippaniyan The same happened with Rajesh Negi
 jab use pathankot airbase main aatankiyon ke ghusane kii khabar mili thi to wo apane saathiyon ke saath search abhiyaan main jute gaye the
 When he encountered the terrorists near the living area with a population of about two and a half thousand, the biggest challenge before him was to save the lives of the people
 unke saathiyon ne aatankiyon ko lalakaara to hamalaavaron ne unke upar grenade phenk diya
 As the grenade exploded, its shrapnel entered Rajesh's body
 usee main se kuch chharre unki ankhon main chale gaye or vah ghayal ho gaye
 However, in this condition, along with other soldiers, he killed two terrorists

 However, in this condition, along with other soldiers, he killed two terrorists
 ye helmet vaishvik standard ko puraa karte hai
 Also, these helmets are convenient to wear and can also be fitted with communication devices
 is sambandh main enesji ke ek varisht afasar ne enditivi india ko bataaya,"goli chaahe kitni bhi nazadiiki se chalaai jaae lekin agar kisi jawan ne ye helmet pahan rakhaa hoga to uske sir par koi chot nahin lagegi
 There are no nuts in this helmet
 iskaa vazan dhai kilo kaa he
 " unke mutabiq kisi bhi aatank rodhi oparation main commando kaa body gear qareeb 28 kilo kaa hota he
 Now two more kilograms will be added to it
 is maamle main is tarah ke aatank rodhi oparation se jude ek commando kaa kahana he,"yah bahut zaruri he kii aapkaa sir surakshit rahe
 When the bullet is moving, it can hit anywhere
 pehle ham apana sir bachaate rahete the lekin ab is helmet se hamaari suraksha bhi bad gai he
 " sabase acchhee baat ye he ki ise bharat main hi banaaya ja rahaa he or ek helmet kii laagat qareeb 6500 rupee he
 Along with this, a senior officer says, "now we have started giving it to some of our troops
 " Earlier, the helmet that NSG commandos wore was not bulletproof due to which the splinter hit it and it injured the young men
 phir javaanon ne bulatopruf pataka pahananaa shuru kiya jisase uske sirf maathe kii hifaazat hoti thi sir kii nahin
 The comments rajesh negi ke saath bhi aisa hi hua tha
 When he got the news of the entry of terrorists into the Pathankot airbase, he along with his comrades were engaged in a search operation
 kareeb dhai hajaar kii aabaadi vaale living aria ke paas unka aamanaa-saamana aatankiyon se hua to unke saamne sabase badi chunauti logon kii jaan bachaana tha
 When his comrades challenged the terrorists, the attackers hurled grenades at him
 grenade fatate hi uske chharre rajesh ke sharir main ghus gaye
 Some of the shrapnel went into his eyes and he was injured
 haalanki is haalat main bhi unhone anya javaanon ke saath milakar do aatankiyon ko dher kar diya

 loksabhaa 2019 chunaav ke nattejey aane ke baad bijepi kii dobaaraa satta main vaapasi ho gai he
 It is going to form an absolute majority government led by Narendra Modi for the second consecutive time
 karnataka main bhi bhagava ne paracham laharaaya
 BJP won 25 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state
 party ke zyaadaatar ummidavaaron ne 1-2 lakh ke margin se jeet hasil kii
 Apart from Mallikarjun Kharge, BJP state president BS Yeddyurappa tightened up after several Congress leaders lost
 unhone kaha, ''piem modi ke khilaaf bolne waalon ko janata ne sabak sikhaaya he
 This is the first time the non-congress party has won so many seats in Karnataka
 '' jaise hi bijepi kii siten badhani shuru huin, malleswaram sthit party offis ke baahar aatishbaajee hone lagi or mithaiyaan banti jane lageen
 Yeddyurappa said that people will not tolerate discrimination as shown by the state's coalition government (congress-jds)
 lekin unki party kii aage kya karne kii yojana he, iskaa khulaasa yediurppa ne nahin kiya
 Yeddyurappa's aide and former deputy CM r Ashok told India Today that it is the people of Karnataka who have given the mandate for Yeddyurappa
 unhone kaha, is vakt siem echdi kumaraswami ko istipha dekar phir se chunaav karaane chahie
 Yeddyurappa's son BY Vijendra also agreed on this
 unhone kaha ki karnataka kii janata kaa janadesh saaf he ki vah gathbandhan sarkaar se tang aa chuke hai or vah bijepi ko dobaaraa satta main dekhnaa chaahate hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, the JDS won only the Haasan seat, on which minister Revanna's son Prajwal won
 lekin echdi kumaraswami ne nateezon ko avishwasaneey bataaya
 He tweeted, "I respect the mandate and congratulate PM Narendra Modi on winning again
" isi twit main unhone kaha, gathbandhan kii donon partiyon ke netaa ek baithak karenge, jisamen jedies or congress ke ummidavaaron kii haar kii samiksha kii jaaegi
 He said, our party has seen many defeats and victories over the years and the workers should not be discouraged
 sutron ne india today ko bataaya ki purv pradhanmantri echdi devgauda tumkur seat se haar rahe hai
 In such a situation, he has asked Kumaraswamy to resign
 lekin kumaraswami ne isse inkaar kar diya
 It is being said that CM has asked Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal to come to Bengaluru soon and discuss the strategy ahead
 congress party ko aisi haar pehle kabhi nahin mili
 Karnataka was once a Congress-ruled state
 lekin 2019 ke nateezon main party sirf ek seat par simatakar rah gai he

 Then Akhilesh has expressed his disagreement

 bhartiya janata party or shivasena ke gathbandhan ko sarkaar banane ke liye janata ne to paryaapt siten di hai, lekin donon dal apni-apni sharton ke hisaab se sarkaar banane ke mood main hai
 As a result, the entire political equation of the state has changed
 ab congress-shivasena gathbandhan bhi satta kii pikchar main aa gaya he or lambey samay se chali aa rahi ye khinchataan dilli tak pahunch gai he
 It is known that Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis can reach Delhi today and meet BJP National President Amit Shah

 On Sunday, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has claimed that the Shiv Sena has the support of 170 mlas i
e
 it is in a position to form the government
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, shivasena saarvajanik taur par bijepi kii aalochana bhi kar rahi he or uske netaa maharashtra kaa aglaa mukhyamantri shivasena se hone kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 On what basis did the Shiv Sena claim absolute majority? If the statement of Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has an absolute majority, this seat number can be made only after the BJP has supported both Congress and NCP
 shivasena ko in donon dalon ke samarthan kii charchaa bhi garam he or is bich ensipi ke pramukh sharad pavaar bhi aaj dilli pahunch rahe hai
 According to sources, Sharad Pawar will meet Congress Working President Sonia Gandhi on the Maharashtra issue

 There have also been indications of this from the leaders of both the NCP and Congress parties
 ravivaar ko hi ensipi ke varisht netaa nawab malik ne kaha he ki shivasena kaa aglaa mukhyamantri hona mumkin he
 However, on the question of support, he put the ball in Shiv Sena's court and said that Shiv Sena should clear its role first, then NCP will also clarify its position
 shivasena ke tevar or talkh, kaha- dosti unheen se banaao jo nibhaane kii aukaat rakhenensipi ke netaa bhale hi khule taur par kuch kehane se batch rahe hon, lekin maharashtra congress ke netaa hossain dalwai sonia gandhi ko chitthee likhakar shivasena ke saath sarkaar banane kii maang kar chuke hai
 However, the top leadership of the Congress does not seem to fully agree on such a proposal keeping in mind a big issue like Ram Mandir
 aise main aaj hone ja rahi sonia gandhi or sharad pavaar kii mulaakaat kaaphi ahm he
 On the other hand, the BJP, which has won the most seats, does not want to let the power slip at any cost
 lihaaja ab jaankaree ye aa rahi he ki bijepi ne shivasena ko nayaa ofer bhi de diya he
 It is being told that the BJP can give the Shiv Sena the post of 16 ministers with deputy CM , which includes important ministries like Revenue and PWD
 shivasena ko vitt or rajasav dene par taiyaar BJP, ye ho saktaa he nai sarkaar kaa formulob dekhnaa dilachasp hoga ki shivasena ko manaane ke liye amit shah or fadanvis kii mulaakaat main kya satta kii bhagidaari ko lekar koi or faisla liya ja saktaa he yaa congress-ensipi vipaksh main baithne ke bajaay shivasena ke saath satta kaa hissaa banegi

 Former Army Chief General VK Singh has targeted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh
 wike singh ne pradhanmantri ko behad maamuli maamalon main laachaari jataane vaala bataaya he
 General Singh has said in his biography 'courage and Convictions' that he had briefed the Prime Minister about his visit to Myanmar and had told him 'in plain terms what is happening and what is not happening'
 ’ unhone apni pustak main kaha he, ‘pradhanmantri ne mujhe bade gaur se suna or ek nirashapurna tareeke se kaha ki ‘general sahab ab ye to procedral (prakriyaatmak) samasyaayein hai
 we are trying
 ’general singh ne kaha he, ‘maine yah baat pehle bhi jane kitni baar suni thi
 i lost count years ago
 mere saamne bharat ke pradhanmantri the, jo aise maamalon main apni laachaari vyakt kar rahe the jo ki behad maamuli the
 Giving information about his visit to Myanmar, he says that the issue was related to handing over a road roller to Myanmar to the country for which the expenditure on the project did not exceed Rs 20 crore
 general singh ne kaha ki pradhanmantri dwaara ‘luk east polisy’ prachaarit kiye jane ke baavjood myanmar dwaara tel khoj kii peshkash ‘kisi kone main padi thi
 "we continued to resent," he said, while think tank experts found another reason to talk about China's increasing influence around us

 ye nai daleel pesh kar rahe hai
 They have to prove that there was a temple and people worshiped
 paraasaran ne kaha ki logon ke vishwaas ke saath puja sthal ko mandir kaha ja saktaa he
 The temple is a general term used for a place of worship
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki sirf kuch yatriyon ke aadhaar par yah nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki vahaan par mandir tha, hinduon ne vahaan par puja is sthaan se shuru kii
 Justice Bhushan asked if there would be one or two judicial persons, Bhumi and Ram? Parasrana said that there would be more than two judicial persons there
 justise bobade ne kaha ki inamen se kuch pramukh devtaa hote hai or anya bhi hote hai
 a temple can have many gods
 paraasaran ne kaha ki mandir main ek pramukh devtaa hota he or anek roopon main ham us devtaa kii puja karte hai
 We call the court the temple of justice
 hamaare paas kai nyaayadhish hai, lekin ham puure ko ek sanstha nyaayalay kehete hai or faisle ko sarvocch faisla kehete hai
 Justice DY Chandrachud said that though there may be many gods in the temple, would everyone call it a juristic person? Parasrana said that but the credit of the judicial personality (judicial person) goes to the head deity of the temple
 rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki court ek nai bahes kii taraf ja rahaa he
 It is not about the naming of the temple
 main is maamle main court ko ek likhit note duungaa
 Parasaran said that two things are required for the temple to be faith and worship of the people
 justise bhushan ne kaha ki jaise sai baba hai, unka bhi janmasthan he, to kya unka janmasthan bhi juristic person hoga
 Parasrana said that the Madras High Court has given its verdict on this and has given the status of God to the High Court
 justise bobade ne poocha ki kya jyotishiya granthon main bhi ram janm ke sthaan, samay kaa koi zikr he kya?rajeev dhawan ne kaha ki koun sa jyotish? wo jyotish jo surya se yaa wo jo chandra kii chaal se mana jaataa he? kyonki kuch jyotishi to surya se, kuch chandra se, kuch janm samay ke sateek lagn or kuch grah gochar ke mutabik jyotishiya gananaa karte hai
 Mathematics and results are different
 ab meraa samay abhi rahu or ketu ke bich fansaa he, jo mujhe mushkil main daal rahaa he
 And according to birth time i am currently under the influence of Shani
 justise bobade ne kaha ki ham to is aashay se puch rahe the ki kya vahaan jyotish granthon main bhi koi tathy he?paraasaran ne kaha ki chait kii navami ko dopaher abhijit nakshatra main ayodhya main vishnu ke saatven avatar bhagwaan ram kaa janm hua
 Hindus celebrate Ram Navami on that Navami
 is utsav or vishesh puja ke liye janmasthan or vahaan bane mandir main puja kaa vidhaan he
 On this day we go to the temple instead of celebrating another festival
 paraasaran kii daleelein puri hone ke baad ramalala kii ore se si vaidyanathan ne daleelein shuru kin
 He rejected the contention of Muslim parties that there was no temple at the disputed site
 vivaadit sthal main bhi hindu puja karte rahe
 Because they believed to be the birthplace there
 khudaai main mili diwaar bhi mandir kii nahin idgah kii hone kii daleel ko bhi khaarij karte hue khudaai main mili anya chizon or report par jor diya
 He said that it is unfortunate that the Waqf Board is raising questions whose answers are present in the High Court's decision
 vaidyanathan ne muslim paksh dwaara kii gai bahes par ek note court main diya
 Vaidyanathan said that once it was proved that Lord Rama was born there, there is no need of any idol there
 vaidyanathan ne kaha ki muslim paksh bhartiya puratathvik surveykshan (ASI) kii report par sawaal uthaa rahaa he or kah rahaa he ki vahaan par idgah thi
 So they are assuming that the Mughals demolished Idgah to build a mosque there
 vaidyanathan ne kaha ki jab kisi jameen ko kisi khaas makasad ke liye samarpit kiya jaataa he, to vah jagah nyaayik ban jaati he, ise divya hone kii jarurat nahin, yah dharmik ho sakati he
 But there is both righteousness and divinity
 vaidyanathan ne kaha ki kyonki bhagwaan ram vahaan paidaa hue the, isliye vah jagah apane aap main hi pavitra or paryaapt he
 Vaidyanathan, reading excerpt from Shoot 4 (sunni Waqf Board) said that Babri Masjid was built on flat ground, there was no Idgah
 ab muslim paksh kah rahaa he ki vahaan par idgah thi
 Rajiv Dhawan said that we had filed a case in 1961, how would we know
 vaidyanathan ne kaha ki hamane 1989 main shoot file kiya tha tab bhi kaha tha ki mandir todakar masjid banaai gai
 Even then you did not answer and today you are saying that the mosque was built by breaking the Idgah
 ye to nayaa concept he
 Vaidyanathan, showing the excavation charts, said that the pillars and their bases have also been found there
 jise idgah kii diwaar bataaya ja rahaa he usamen upar bhi chat hone ke saboot mili hai
 Idgah does not have a roof
 vah sirf ek wal nahin balki haul tha, mandir kaa vishaal haul
 Dhawan also objected to this and said that that part is not inscribed
 vaidyanathan ne kaha ki ye us mudde par mujhe kyon baadhit kar rahe hai, jo inaki daleel kaa hissaa hi nahin tha
 There was a debate on what Vaidyanathan was referring to as part of the excavation, Dhawan was telling a unique part
 vaidyanathan ne kaha ki orcyological survey ne khudaai ke 25 video banaae the jise elahabaad hoicourt ne dekha tha
 The High Court found nothing wrong in the report
 site note bhi hoicourt ke saamne rakhe gaye the
 The ASI report was closely examined by the High Court
 khudaai main mili ek-ek saamaan kii entry kii gai he
 There is no mention of Idgah anywhere in it
 khudaai main mili diwaar number 18 par di ja rahi hindu paksh kii daleel par muslim paksh ne sawaal uthaaya
 The Hindu side said that the wall is part of a room
 muslim paksh ne virodh jataate hue kaha ki is hisse kaa puraa utkhanan nahin hua tha isliye ise kamare kii diwaar kaa hissaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The Election Commission has reacted to this amid opposition to the decision to hold the Lok Sabha Election 2019 in the month of Ramadan
 chunaav ayog ne kaha ki kisi bhi shuukravaar yaa tyohaar ke din matdaan nahin hai
 The Election Commission rejected the questions arising on the decision to hold elections in the month of Ramadan, saying that the main festival and Friday have been taken care of in the election program

 fatehpuri masjid ke shahi imam doctor mufti mukarram ahamed ne kaha ki ramajaan ke dauraan chunaav kii taarikh par mujhe etraz he
 If appropriate, considering the sentiments of crores of Muslims, one should revisit the date of elections from May 6 to May 19
 unhone aage kaha ki mujhe shaq he ki isamen siyaasi daanv pench shaamil ho saktaa he kyonki ye faisla koi achaanak nahin kiya gaya he balki isaki planning pehle se kii gayi hogi
 OSD of Sachar Committee and Chairman of Zakat Foundation by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Dr
 saiyad zafar mahmud ne enditivi se baat karte hue kaha ki chunaav ramadan main na hote to acha tha
 Now that the dates have been announced, so there is no scope for change of date

 ol india muslim mahila personal lau board, adhyaksh shysta ambar ne kaha ki nirvachan ayog kaa ramadan ke maheene main chunaav kii taarikh kaa elaan munasib nahin he
 Every Muslim waits for the month of Ramadan, even the government employees save their holidays throughout the year that they will fast in the month of peace from prayer
 ramadan ke maheene main roza rakhkar vot dene janaa kashton ko sahan karnaa padegaa, namaaz or roza jaisi ibaadat main bahut baadhaaen aaengi

 lekin ye chunaav kii taarikh se desh ke 15 pratishat musalamaanon kii suvidhaon ko saamne nahin rakhaa gaya
