 reatin3 starkalakaarbipasha basu, imran abbaas or mukul devdiarectorcvikram bhattakrichar 3di ke bare main bipasha basu or diarector vikram bhatta pehle hi kah chuke hai ki yah horer movie nahin balki krichar besd he
 There is an attempt to show something similar in the film
 yah kuch-kuch bhartiya parampara or kalpana ko pankh lagaakar gadhi gai film he
 In which a bit of horror has been put
 vikram bhatta apni pichhali kuch filmon se 3di formet ko tri kar rahe hai, or safal bhi rahe hai
 a similar attempt is also in the creche
 agar film kii lambaai kuch kam kar di hoti or kahani thodi or tarksangat hoti to yah dhamaakedaar film ban sakati thi
 But due to the acting and technology of Bipasha Basu, the film looks good at some places
 vaise bhi is tarah kii himmat karke vikram ne ek nae trend kii shuruyaat to kar hi di he
 How much of the story is shot in the beautiful plains of Himachal Pradesh
 ahaana (bipasha) himachal main jangal ke bichombich main ek loj kholti hai
 People also come a lot, but then one Brahmarakshas comes to these forests, and starts hunting to satisfy their hunger
 brahmarakshas ke nishane par ahaana kaa loj bhi aa jaataa he
 The story then begins with Ahana saving his existence and fighting the Brahmarakshas
 akasar bhartiya diarectaron kii kamajori rahi he ki ve jis vishay ko uthaate hai, us par vah shuru se lekar aakhir tak kaayam nahin rah pate
 The rhythm breaks
 romance or na jane-jane kya-kya baaten daalane ke chakkar main film ko lachar kar dete hai
 This happened to Vikram as well
 unhen bipasha or krichar kaa muqabla kuch zyada dikhaanaa chahie tha
 The story could have been made more interesting
 star apilbipasha ko to ab bollywood main horer queen ke naam se pahachaane jane laga he
 She has been doing similar films for some time, which other Bollywood actresses might not even want to give up
 bipasha ne is tarah ke faislon se apni boldnes kaa to izhaar kar diya he, or is tarah kii filmon main maharath bhi hasil kar lee he
 His scenes in the film are very enjoyable
 unke chehre par aane vaale expreshans bhi mjedaar hai
 However, his chemistry with Imran is not well received
 mukul dev mjedaar or dilachasp hai
 There is also an audience that does not get into a lot of arguments while watching such films and believes in enjoying every event happening onscreen
 film ke ek do gane bhi achche hai
 The message is coming to see the film and it has a similar spice
 krichar aisi film he jo chote shaharon or single screen theatron ke liye bani he
 Anyway, films with women leads are being liked
 pichley chaar hafton main mardaani or meri kaum ke baad yah teesri film he jo heroin besd he
 Now it's Bipasha's turn pakistan se ghati main aane vaali teror funding ko 'ajtak' ke sting 'oparation hurriyat' ne camere par benakaab kiya tha
 After this operation, the investigating agency NIA has also arrested Hurriyat leaders in the case of Terror funding
 saath hi sting oparation kii vajah se ghati main hone vaali patharbaji main bhi baari giravat ai he
 Since the Hurriyat has been tightened, money has not been reached to the stone-pelters and this is why the stonewalling in the valley has reduced
 aaie aapako silsilewar tareeke se bataate hai ki aakhir ghati main paak pryojit patharbaji par kaise lagaam kasi gai he
 1
 'ajtak' ke sting oparation main hurriyat netaaon ko camere main paak funding kii baat kaboolte dikhaaya gaya tha
 The NIA officials then formed a team of 8 sp-level officials and started an investigation into Pakistan's funding in Kashmir
 2
 It was only after watching the sting 'operation Hurriyat' that the NIA, the investigative agency that monitors terrorism and terrorist incidents, immediately took major action by registering a case of preliminary investigation
 enie ne sabase pehle 'ajtak' ke camere par pakistan se ho rahi hawala funding kii baat kaboolne vaale naeem khan, bitta karate, javed baba, hafiz said sahit anya logon ke khilaaf jaanch shuru kii
 3
 jab is jaanch main enie ko vaise pukhta saboot mili jisamen hurriyat netaaon ke sidhe sambandh hijbul mujahidin or lashkar ke chif se milane lage to grih mantralay ke likhit aadesh ke baad enie ne FIR darj karte hue jaanch shuru kii
 The FIR was lodged against unknown persons including jamaat-ud-dawa Chief Hafiz Saeed, Hizbul Mujahideen, dukhtaran-e-millat, Hurriyat Conference
 4
 According to the FIR, Hurriyat Conference is receiving money through hawala
 FIR main kaha gaya he ki centre sarkaar ko soochna mili he ki hijbul mujahidin, lashkar-e-taiyaba or anyaatanki sanghathanon kii mileebhagatse hurriyat conference kai gaiyrkanoonee or hawala channel ke jariye pakistan se paise le rahaa he, jiskaa istemaal kashmir ghati ko ashaant banaae rakhane ke liye hota he
 5
 sutron se pataa chalaa he ki algaavvaadi mahila netaa asia andrabi ke netritv main mahilaon kii ek team skool or college kii chaatraon ko bahakaati he
 The agency believes that these women are given money to engage the girl students in stone pelting
 jaanch agency kii FIR main hafiz said, hurriyat conference ke sadsy, hijbul mujahidin, lashkar-e-taiyaba or dukhtaraan-e-millat ko aaropee bataaya gaya he
 After several big names in the FIR, a series of raids and interrogations of Hurriyat leaders started
 6
 The NIA then took major action on 3 June 2017, raiding about two dozen places in different cities including Jammu and Kashmir and Delhi, in which the NIA had found many shocking documents
 enie sutron se mili jaankaree ke mutabik in dastavejon ke aadhaar par enie naeem khan, bitta karate, javed baba, sahid ul islam, altaaf funtoos jaise algaavvaadi netaaon se dilli main darjanon baar poochtacha kar chuki he
 7
 ab 7 mukhya aaropee NIA kii giraft main he
 The court has remanded 10 accused
 aane vaale samay main syed ali shah gilaani jaise bade hurriyat netaaon par NIA shikanja kasega
 According to information received from NIA sources, the NIA is investigating the funding from Pakistan in the first phase
 agle kai charnon main jaanch puri kii jaaegi
 8
 hurriyat netaaon se dilli main poochtacha ke bich patharbaji main baari kami ai he
 The separatist leaders have been accused of giving stones to the stonemasons for 500 and 1000 rupees for one day
 ab paak funding par nakel lagane ke baad, pakistan se hone vaali funding ko in patharbaajon tak nahin pahunch paa rahi he
 For this reason, the stone-pellers are not able to execute the stone pelting incident
 9
 The statistics of the security agencies clearly show that from June 1 to 11 July this year, 44 terrorists piled up, yet there was no major stone pelting incident
 'aazatak' ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik pichley saal 2016 main jab bhi aatankiyon ke kilaaf suraksha bal karrwai karte the to kai dinon tak patharbaj aatankiyo kii madad ke liye patharbaji shuru kar dete the
 But from June 1 to July 11 this year, 44 terrorists have been killed and sporadic incidents of stone-pelting have occurred
 10
 On July 8 last year, after the death of Burhan Wani, there was stone pelting in the valley for 3 months
 pichley saal patharbaji main suraksha agenciyon ke hajaaron jawan ghayal hue lekin is saal jab se enie kii jaanch ke baad pakistani funding par lagaam lagi he
 Also, investigations against Hurriyat leaders have reduced the incidents of stone pelting
 diji siarpief ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main kaha he ki pichley saal kii apeksha is saal patharbaji kii sankhya main kaaphi kami ai he
 On the question asked on 'operation Hurriyat', the DG CRPF said that since the manner in which the NIA is capturing the handlers of these stones, there has been a decrease in incidents of such stone pelting
 iske alaava patharbaji ko rokane ke liye siarpief kii taraf se nae tareekon kaa istemaal kiya gaya, us ranneeti se bhi isapar lagaam lagi he
 So far this year, there have been 424 stone-pelting incidents, while last year, far more stone-pelting incidents have occurred
 2 din pehle bihar ke gaya jile main jis tareeke se 16 yuvakon ne pakistan jindabad ke naare lagaae, is par bhaajapa ke varisht netaa susheel kumaar modi ne kaha he rajya main mahagathbandhan sarkaar aisa lagata he maano bihar ko kashmir bananaa chaahati he

 Modi said that by not taking action on such facts, the Bihar government is encouraging the supporters of Pakistan and raised the question whether the Grand Alliance government wants to make Bihar Kashmir
 Questioning Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Modi asked why the speedy trial has not yet started against the accused in the terror attacks in Bodh Gaya and Patna? Modi attacked the Janata Dal United and said that the testimony of Pakistani terrorist David Headley Seeing the religion of Ishrat Jahan, who was proved to be a terrorist, JDU was telling her a daughter of Bihar some time ago, today this party from Bhopal jail Doors and 8 are shedding tears over the death of SIMI terrorists
 susheel modi ne twit kiya, 'majahab dekar raajnneeti karne vaali party maare gaye simi ke aatankwaadiyon main se kisi ek ko bihar kaa betaa kahkar chaati peet sakate hai',modi ne kaha ki argedy adhyaksh lalu prasad or bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar bhopal muthbhed par sawaal uthaakar suraksha agenciyon kaa manobal tod rahe hai
 Modi said that the charges of such politicians should be punished under the sedition law by wrongly seizing their property

 The comments party ke kopbhaajan bane donon netaa yediurppa ke kattar samarthak hai or bhaajapa ke rajya tathaa kendriya netritv par prahaar karte rahe hai
 Apparently the BJP hopes that action against the two leaders will lead other leaders of Yeddyurappa to go to Chet and prevent themselves from attending the rebel leader's public meeting in Haveri on Sunday and thus the Shettar government will be safe

 He challenged his former party to dissolve the assembly and face the public instead of taking action on his supporters

 So Sania, 32, has to stop saying, 'to begin with, first of all parents, neighbors, aunts and uncles need to stop saying that you will get dark and if you play, no one will marry you

 This culture must change
 ’peshewar circuit main karengi vapasipakistani cricketer shoeb malik kii patni sania maa banane ke baad agle saal peshewar circuit main vaapasi par kaam kar rahi hai
 Talking about her tennis journey, Sania said that she had only one player to take inspiration from, she was the great runner PT Usha
 pehle sirf piti ushaa thim, ab to kai
 
 
 He said that but now times have changed and many women athletes are becoming role models for the current players
 sania ne kaha, ‘mujhe garv mahasoos hota he ki maine mahilaon ko khel apnaane main shaayad thodi si bhoomika adaa kii
 The female player i could draw inspiration from was PT Usha
 aaj ham pivi sindhu, sina nehwal, deepa karmakar or kai anya kaa naam le sakate hai

 aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat ne mangalvaar ko dilli main ek kitaab ke vimochan ke dauraan chakit karne vaali ghoshnaa kii ki bharat ek hindu raashtra he
 Bhagwat declared, 'we can change everything
 sabhi vichaardhaaraein badali ja sakati hai, lekin sirf ek cheez nahin badali ja sakati, vah yah ki 'bharat ek hindu raashtra he'
 Referring to Hindutva, the RSS chief took the names of Hanuman, Shivaji and RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar in one breath
 hindu raashtra ke daawey ke baavjood jab sanstha ke pramukh samalagikta par baat karte hai to lagata he ki aresas apni gambhir chhavi badalane main laga hua he
 Bhagwat said that this issue can be resolved through discussion
 unhone kaha, "mahabharat, pracheen senaaon main udhaaharan rahe hai, vedon main nahin
 This is not the first time Bhagwat has hinted at a change in the Sangh's stand on homosexuality
 unhone 2018 main teen divasiy maha aayojan 'bharat kaa bhavishya -aresas kaa drushtikon' ke dauraan kaha tha ki samalangik hai or samaaj ko samay ke saath badalane kii jarurat he
 Most of Bhagwat's speech was on presenting a liberal face of the RSS, but he stressed the importance of disagreement
 unhone kaha, 'hamaare yahaan matbhed ho saktaa he, manabhed nahin
 According to the PTI report, its chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday categorically denied that the RSS was following any 'lawsuit' and claimed that the same ideology in the organization has been going on continuously that 'the land of India He does 'bhakti', he is 'hindu'
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) ke sarasang chaalak ne yah baat abivipi se jude varisht prachaarak sunil ambekar kii pustak ‘da aresas: rodmap for 21 centuri' ke lokaparn samaaroh main kahi
 He said, "we did not create Hindus," referring to the claims made by the Sangh to talk only of Hindus
 ye hajaaron varsho se chale aa rahe hai
 Countries are coming together with time, situation
 ' unhone kaha ki bharat ko apni mathrubhumi maanane vaala or usase prem karne vaala ek bhi vyakti agar jivit hai, tab tak hindu jivit he
 Bhagwat said that language, creed, province are already there
 agar baahar se bhi koi aae hai, tab bhi koi baat nahin he
 We have also adopted people from outside
 ham sabhi ko apana hi maanate hai
 He said, 'we have changed ourselves according to the country, time, situation, but the one who does devotion to India, has inherited it in the full form of Indianism, is a Hindu
 
 This ideology remains in the Union continuously
 isamen koi bhram nahin he
 ' rajyasabha kii kaarywahi sthagit hone se behad naaraaz bijepi ne kaha he ki sarkaar ke bahumat nahin he or vah rajyasabha main voting karwaane se pehle hi bhaag khadi hui
 He also said that the UPA government has lost its political and constitutional right to remain in power
 vahiin rajyasabha main vipaksh ke netaa arun jetali sarkaar par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki jab se bharat kii sansad bani he tab se ab tak sansad ko itnaa bada dhokhaa kisi ne nahin diya
 He also said that the government which runs away from voting
 use sarkaar main rahane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 This is a moral defeat of the government

 bihar main swasthya sevaaon kii badtar haalat kii pole kholane vaali ek khabar or saamne ai he
 At Nalanda District Sadar Hospital here, a father could not find a government ambulance to carry the dead body of his dead child and was forced to take his body home by motorcycle

 According to the information, Virendra Yadav, a resident of Sitapur village under Parwalpur police station, had brought his eight-year-old son Sagar Kumar to Sadar Hospital in Nalanda district headquarters Bihar Sharif on Tuesday morning for treatment of sudden fever and abdominal pain
 haalanki doctoron ne bachche ko mrit ghoshit kar diya
 The child's father alleges that he kept circling the hospital for an ambulance to carry his dead child but was not provided an ambulance by the hospital administration
 He was forced to take his son's body by a motorcycle
 holi khilne ke dauraan ham puure josh or masti main hote hai
 We forget that the next day we have to go to office or work
 aise main agar rang main buree tarah puta hua cheharaa lekar aap kaam par pahunchenge to hansi kaa paatr banenge
 But if you take care of these things, then not only will it be easy to get rid of the color from your skin after playing Holi but there will be no harm to the skin
 1
 First of all, check the wardrobe
 aise puraane kapade nikaal lijie jisase aapkaa puraa sharir dhak jayega
 The less color applied to the body, the easier it will be to get rid of
 2
 Apply cold cream or oil to the part of the body which is open
 tel lagi skin par rang jam nahin paaegaa or aasaani se chhot jayega
 3
 agar holi ke din aap dhoop main nikalne vaale hai to tanning se bachane ke liye waterpruf sanscream bhi laga len
 Sunscream will not only protect the skin from tanning but also will not stick to color
 jaaniye, barsaanaa main kyon or kaise khelte hai latoomaar holi4
 It is very necessary to drink water while playing Holi
 paryaapt maatra main pani pine twachaa main nami bani rahati he
 Color can have a bad effect on dry skin
 isliye pani pite rahen
 5
 holi khelte vakt sharir kaa to khyaal ham rakh lete hai lekin hoth or kaan ko bhul jate hai
 If you apply lip balm or Vaseline on the lips and ears, both will be safe and there will be no harm
 bharat nahin yahaan manaai jaati he duniya kii sabase badi holi!agar holi khelte vakt sharir ke kisi hisse main khulji yaa jalan ho rahi he to turant us jagah thanda pani daalen
 If the burning sensation does not stop then visit a dermatologist
 rajdhani dilli main ek mahila ne apni hi car chura lee
 He did not steal from such a place, but from the nose of the police
 sunne main bhale hi yah baat hairaan karne vaali ho, par yah sach he
 In fact, a 29-year-old woman doing business parked her car in a 'no parking zone' in a crowded area like Delhi's Chandni Chowk
 trephic ke niyam kaa khuleam ulanghan karne par uski car ko trephic police apane saath le gai
 The traffic police later deposited the car with the Delhi Police
 galat jagah khadi kii karmahila ne 'dilari' dikhaate hue apni jabt ho chuki car ko chura liya
 The confiscated car is considered to be the property of the police until the process is completed
 ghatana 12 july kii he
 The Delhi Police officer said that the woman parked her car outside the town hall of Chandni Chowk
 vahaan se car kraine se khinchakar old police line le jaai gai
 All seized vehicles are kept at the same place
 car ko kraine se khinchakar le jaaya gayapulice ne mutabik, car laae jane ke kareeb 20 minute baad hi vah mahila vahaan pahunchi or apni gaadi ke bare main poochtacha karne lagi
 He soon found his car
 mahila bade aaraam se apni car kii driving seat par baithkar use start karne lagi
 When the constable present there told her that she could not get a car without depositing fine like this, she started abusing him
 iske baad vah gaadi lekar maukey se chanpat ho gai
 During this time other policemen were also present there
 ek consteble ne to chalaang lagaakar gaadi ko pakadaney kii koshish bhi kii, par vah isamen kaamyaab nahin ho sakaa
 a case has been registered against the woman under Section 379, 186, 332 against the woman who escaped due to defying the police
 car kisi kajri gupta ke naam se registerd he
 The police came to know that the woman doing business stays at a doctor's house
 jaankaree ke mutabik, mahila ne doctor ko kabhi rent nahin chukaaya he
 The court has ordered him to vacate the house
 baharhaal, police ne kaha ki mahila faraar ho chuki he, jisaki khoj kii ja rahi he
 The police hope that she will be caught soon
 jai shri ram, puri takat ke saath boliye jai shri ram
 At one time, with which so much talk, the Ganges named Ram used to flow in any assembly, enthusiastic activists used to describe the model of Ram temple in Ayodhya as the model of Ram Rajya of the whole country
 aaj usee vishwa hindu parishad (vihip) ke antarashtriya adhyaksh 'praveen togadiya' sanghathan se hameshaa ke liye begaane ho gaye
 Raghav Reddy, candidate of Pravin Togadia faction, has suffered a tough defeat in the VHP election to be held after almost 52 years
 32 varsh tak vishwa hindu parishad main rahane ke baavjood aaj kyon sanghathan ne togadiya ko teen talaak de diya
 Actually for this, we have to take a look at the events that have taken place in the last few months
 kabhi togadiya kaa gaayab hona to kabhi khulkar sarkaar ke khilaaf bolnaa, ghatnaayen aisi thim ki praveen togadiya ke saath satta paksh kii rassakassi jagajaahir hone lagi thi
 Praveen Togadia's farewell to the VHP, slashed in the Modi opposition, has today brought the politics of the Sangh Parivar to the surface
 narendra modi ke samarthan or virodh main aaj kahin na kahin sangh or iske aanushanbik sanghathan bante hue dikhte hai
 As a leader, Modi has become so strong today that there is no scope for his opposition
 isiilie aaj togadiya kaa vahi haal hua jo kabhi sanjay joshi kaa hua tha
 Critically criticizing the policies of the government and calling it anti-farmer, anti-hindu, anti-youth is the only reason for his departure
 kabhi modi or togadiya kii pragadh dosti kaa koi doosraa udhaaharan jaldi miltaa nahin tha
 Both of them took the ideas of the Sangh to every corner of Gujarat
 narendra modi ke bijepi main jane ke baad bhi inke sambandh bane rahe
 When Modi was given political exile from his own state, it was Pravin Togadia in Gujarat who fully supported him at his level to ensure Modi's return
 kabhi gujarat kii bhaajapa sarkaar main bade str par dakhal rakhane vaale togadiya aaj haashiye par kyon khadey hai?darasal sthitiyaan saal 2002 ke gujarat dangon ke baad puri tarah se badal gayi
 Praveen Togadia, who once stole Hinduism in Modi's political image, was now becoming the biggest problem for Narendra Modi
 dangon ke aarope gujarat kii modi sarkaar ke upar lag rahe the or muslim virdohi hinsa ko sarkaar ke str par pryojit bataaya ja rahaa tha
 Narendra Modi started munching on organizations like Praveen Togadia, VHP and Bajrang Dal to give himself political life
 yahi aarope togadiya bhi hameshaa se lagaate aaen hai ki modi ne apni raajnneeti chamakaane ke liye unhen bali kaa bakra banaaya
 Allegations were also made that the Gujarat government committed the sin of killing 300 Hindus by police firing in the riots and after the riots fifty thousand Hindus were put in jail
 togadiya hue kisaan or yuva premitogadiya ke hi mutabik saal 2004 ke baad se unke or modi ke bich main vyaktigat duriyon kaa faasla bahut zyada bad gaya
 But Togadia never allowed the Modi opposition to be revealed to the people
 pichley kuch mahino main jis tarah se wo sarkaar ke virodh main khulkar saamne aaen hai wo kahin naa kahin modi or togadiya donon ko nuksaan pahunchane vaala he
 Ram temple was right till Kashmir, but now Togadia is also raising the issue of farmers and youth with great vigor
 pehle sanjay joshi aaj togadiya to phir aglaa koun ? darasal bijepi or sangh ke bheetar modi yug kii praasangikta ko barkaraar rakhane kaa ek prabal prayaas he
 Now Togadia is going on an indefinite fast from April 17, so this means that the political temperature is going to increase
 aresas bhi is baar sawaalon se batch nahin saktaa 
 It is certain to know between the cadre of the Sangh and the BJP that the image of one person is dominating the entire organization today
 *** The famous Punjabi singer Daler Mehndi is known for his style in the music industry
 saalon se unke gaanon par phens 'tara raa raa' karte najar aae hai
 But now Daler Henna also has the color of Hariyanvi Singer Sapna Chaudhary
 yaa yun kahen sapana ke hit andaaj ko daler mehandi ne punjabi tach dete hue superhit banane kii koshish kii he
 Daler Mehndi and Sapna Chaudhary's song Baoli Tired has been released on April 25
 is puure gane main sapana choudhary ke chehre or unke hariyaanvi andaaj ko dikhaaya gaya he
 But this entire song is of Daler Mehndi because the lyrics, music of this song has been composed by Daler Mehndi
 lekin gane ko sunne ke baad ye sawaal jarur uthta he ki daler mehandi jaise punjabi pop singer ko sapana choudhary kii shoharat ko bhunaane kii kya jarurat pad gai
 This song may be good to listen to and fun to watch, but it is missing the magic of Daler Mehndi which is all crazy
 neeche sun sakate hai ganadaler mehandi lambey vakt se punjabi industry or bollywood par raaj kar rahe hai
 Even if the crowd of new singers is seen making rap in the industry
 lekin aaj bhi daler mehandi kii aawaaj kaa ek gaanaa antham ban jaataa he
 In such a situation, Sapna Chaudhary is the famous face of today's time, but like Daler Mehndi, the singers dream of singing, they do not need any Sapna Chaudhary
 baawali tered gaanaa puri tarah se hariyaanvi he
 The Punjabi language is used just at the beginning of the song
 haalanki daler mehandi ke signechar step par sapana choudhary ko thirakate dekha ja saktaa he
 It is okay to listen to the song as a new experiment
 lekin daler mehandi ke hit number kii play list main ise jagah dene kii galati shaayad hi koi daler paaji kaa fain karegaa
 Seeing the song, it definitely seems that Daler Paji has tried to involve himself in the race of the new age, which is hit but not superhit
 christmas yani 25 disambar ko 'good gavarnence de' manaae jane par sarkari skulon ko khulaa rakhe jane se jude vivaad main nayaa mode aa gaya he
 The Modi government has hit back at the Congress on this issue
 
 
 
 Because the minister was once a student too, now the BJP government at the center is exposing a circular issued by the then Congress government in 1987
 isamen kaha gaya tha ki navoday vidyalayon ke students tab tak skool campus chhodkar apane ghar nahin ja sakate, jab tak sarkaar aupchaarik taur par chhuttiyon kaa elaan nahin kar de
 It said that students would celebrate all other holidays in the residential school itself
 congress ke netritv main vipakshi partiyon ne christmas ke din skulon ko khulaa rakhane ke sarkaar ke kathith aadesh ke mudde ke khilaaf aawaaj uthaa rahi hai
 The Congress has also warned against bringing a privilege motion against Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu and Human Resource Development Minister Smriti Irani for misleading Parliament
 duusari ore venkaiya naidu ne sansad main kaha tha ki congress party kaa agenda ek 'parivaar' ke mutabik tay hota tha
 He said that people will not be allowed to politicize the issue
 yah ek samvedansheel mudda he
 It is worth noting that the Ministry of Human Resource Development issued a separate circular to celebrate Navodaya Vidyalaya, CBSE School and AICTE on 25 December as Good Governance Day
 haalanki kendriya mantri ne spasht kiya tha ki sabhi bhagidaari svaichhik hongi or sansthaanon ko christmas ke din skool khulaa rakhane kii jarurat nahin he
 The Rajasthan government has prepared a proposal that if you want to drink alcohol in Rajasthan, then you will have to do cow service
 rajasthan kii vasundhara sarkaar kii aabkaari vibhaag ne aisa niyam banaaya he ki jo bhi sharaab piyegaa use gau mata tex dena padegaa
 The Government of Rajasthan has issued a proposal to the Excise Department to the Cabinet through a circular, within which it is proposed that cow tax should be imposed on the sale of liquor
 iske liye prastaav vitt vibhaag ko bheja gaya he
 The finance department will decide how much cow tax to be levied on the sale of liquor
 rajasthan kii vasundhara sarkaar hinguniya gaushala main hajaaron gaay ke marane se jo dhabba unki sarkaar par laga he use dhone ke liye gaayon ke liye baari-bharkam fund jutaney ja rahi he
 The Rajasthan government had asked its high-income excise department how it could raise money for cow services
 aabkaari vibhaag ne sharaab kii har bottle kii bikri se lekar baar or hotalon main har paig par gau tex lagane kaa prastaav sarkaar ko bheja he
 The government has put it through the circular in the cabinet, where green signal will be implemented in Rajasthan through ordinance
 iske liye prastaav vitt vibhaag ko bheja gaya he
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Rajendra Rathore said that the Finance Department will study the excise department's proposal
 prastaav par antim faisla mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje lengi
 Earlier in Rajasthan, Vasundhara government imposed a 10 to 20 percent tax on stamp duty which is being charged now
 jisase kareeb 300 karod kii aamadani ho rahi he
 6 lakh cow money from about 1600 gaushalas of the state are being given money but demand for more money is coming up from the gaushalas
 abhi stamp duty se vasula ja rahaa he karphilhal stamp duty par jo kar lagaaya ja rahaa he usase paisa gaushalaon ko anudaan dene ke liye jamaa nahin ho paa rahaa he kyonki mandi kii vajah se makaanon kii registry kaaphi kam ho gai he or cou tex kii vasuuli kaaphi kam ho rahi he
 Elections are due in Rajasthan this year and cow service is a big issue
 congress bijepi sarkaar ko gau mata kii hatyari sarkaar bataa rahi he
 As of now, 60 per cent of the amount is being given to the Gaushalas from the DL Management Fund
 haal hi main centre sarkaar ne dizaster management main se gau seva ke liye die jane vaale fund main 90% kii katautee kar di he
 Sage saints have performed several times in Rajasthan due to non-grant of Gaushalas
 aise main sarkaar kii manshaa he ki rajya main agar sharaab pargau mata texlgaya jaataa he to gaushalaon ke anudaan ke liye baari rakam sarkaar ke khajaane main aa jaaegi
 The government wants to show that it is preparing a large fund in the state for cow services
 haalanki isse sharaab ke shaukeen logon ko jhatka lagegaa kyonki sharaab kii keemton main badhotaree hogi
 On this occasion, many people were present besides the judges of the Supreme Court, Justice Madan B
 Lokur, Justice Deepak Gupta, Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice DY Chandrachud

 In the eastern cities of Libya, there has been a fear of a civil war in the wake of fierce firing between troops and rebels loyal to Muammar Gaddafi
 libya ke jeton ne virodhiyon ke ilaake main jabardast bambaari kii jabaki tripoli mashinagan se hui golibari se dahal gaya jo chautarafa ghir chuke netaa kaa garh mana jaataa he
 Al Jazeera reported that the Libyan jets targeted the rebel areas bin Jawad, the oil port city of Ras Lanuf, Misurata and Aj Javia which are located just 50 kilometers west of Tripoli
 ladaai kii khabaron ke bich libya ke sarkari televijan ne daawa kiya ki misurataa or aj javia shaharon par gaddaphi kii sena dwaara kabja karne ke ullas main goliyaan chalaai gayi
 a day earlier, the anti-government boys had retaliated to the frequent attacks of soldiers loyal to Gaddafi and forced him to retreat
 al jajira ne kaha ki baharhaal misurataa ke nivaasiyon ne kaha ki shahar par phir se kabje kii khabaren galat hai
 Facing international pressure, the 68-year-old Gaddafi warned in an interview to the French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche that Islamic jihad could break if his all-round attack on power continues
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ne gautamabuddha nagar sadar kii up jiladhikari durga shakti nagpal ke nilamban ke sarkaar ke kadam ko ek baar phir tark sangat bataate hue kaha ki sarkaar gadabadi karne vaale adhikariyon ke khilaaf karrwai har haal main karegi
 Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the inauguration ceremony of various development schemes, the Chief Minister said, 'someone called me at six o'clock on Monday evening that your popularity is over
 aap bataaen ki sarkaar apana kaam karegi yaa nahin
 He said, 'the truth is you (the media) also know and the government
 sarkaar ko jo karrwai kerani thi, vah kii
 He gave the charge sheet to the accused officer
 ab prakriya ko chalane dijiye
 Akhilesh said on another question, 'you tell me whether the government will do its job or not
 jo log pradesh kaa maahaul kharaab karnaa chahenge, unke khilaaf karrwai hogi yaa nahin
 However, the Chief Minister did not give a clear answer to the report of the Local Notification Unit (LIU) stating that the under-construction wall of the mosque at Kadalpur in Gautam Budh Nagar was demolished not by the Deputy Collector of Sadar but by the Deputy Collector of Jewar Tehsil

 But as soon as the people of Gokuldham check the bill, they get very upset
 dukaan ke bill ko check karne par pataa chalata he ki pichley maheene se doodh ke daam 5 rupee bad gaye hai
 The residents of Gokuldham are worried about the increased prices of milk and are very angry at Abdul that why did Abdul tell about the price increase on milk after a month? In order to find out the increased prices of milk, all the members of the society in 'taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah' go to Abdul's shop to get Abdul's price down
 lekin jab abdul sabko bataata he ki ye daam usne nahin balki company ne badaye hai, to isapar sabhi sadsy niraash ho jate hai
 Seeing the members of the society in tension, Abdul is upset that he will reduce his share of commission from the price of milk
 abdul gokuldham vaasiyon ko bazaar main jaakar doodh ke daam pataa karne kii bhi salaah detaa he
 Now it will be seen whether Gokuldham will go to the rest of the milk vendors and find out the price of milk in the market?

 And somehow he ran away to Bangkok

 shahi kii hatya se uchhla nambahubali banakar shriprakash shukla ab jurm kii duniya main naam kama rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, in 1997, he killed the politician and notorious criminal Virendra Shahi in Lucknow

 He wanted to contest from Chillupar assembly seat
 iske baad ek ek karke na jane kitne hi hatya, apharan, avaidh vasuuli or dhamkee ke maamle shriprakash shukla ke naam likhe gaye
 a parasol that was on railway contracts was out of reach of Rajshriprakash Shukla Police
 uskaa naam usase bhi bada banataa ja rahaa tha
 The UP police was shocked
 naam pataa tha lekin uski koi tasviir police ke paas nahin thi
 Extortion from traders, kidnapping, murder, robbery, unrestrained rule on railway contracts from east to west
 bas yahi uskaa pesha tha
 And whoever came between it did not delay at all to kill him
 lihaaja log to log police tak usase darati thi
 STF Sriprakash's blatant crimes were made to catch Shukla had become a headache for the government and police
 sarkaar ne uske khatme kaa man bana liya tha
 There was a meeting of the Chief Minister of UP, the Home Minister and the DGP at the Lucknow Secretariat
 isamen aparaadhiyon se nipatane ke liye special force banane kii yojana taiyaar hui
 On May 4, 1998, the then ADG of UP Police, Ajayraj Sharma, sorted out the best 50 personnel of the state police and formed Special Task Force (STF)
 is force kaa pehla task tha- shriprakash shukla, jinda yaa murda
 The first encounter with the police was on 9 September 1997, the first police encounter with Sriprakash
 police ko khabar mili ki shriprakash apane teen saathiyon ke saath salon main bal katwane lakhanu ke janpath market main aane vaala tha
 Police laid siege all around
 lekin yah oparation naa sirf fail ho gaya balki police kaa ek jawan bhi shahid ho gaya
 After this encounter Sriprakash Shukla's panic increased all over UP
 police komushkil semily thi tasvirsaadi vardi main tainaat eke 47 se las estf ke javaanon ne lakhanu se gajiabad, gajiabad se bihar, kalakatta, jaipur tak chhapemari tab jaakar shriprakash shukla kii tasviir police ke haath lagi
 Here, the STF was searching for Sriprakash and on the other hand, Sriprakash Shukla had reached Patna to carry out the biggest crime of his career
 patna main kiya tha mantri kaa murdershriprakash shukla ne 13 june 1998 ko patna sthit indira gandhi hospital ke baahar bihar sarkaar ke tatkaaleen mantri brij bihari prasad kii goli markar hatya kar di
 The minister was killed when security guards were present with him
 wo apni laal batti kii car se utre hi the ki eke 47 se las 4 badmaashon ne unpar firing shuru kar di or vahaan se faraar ho gaye
 With the supariis murder of the Chief Minister's murder, Sriprakash had made it clear that now he has an umbrella rule on railway contracts from east to west
 bihar ke mantri ke katl kaa maamla abhi thanda bhi nahin hua tha ki tabhi upi police ko ek aisi khabar mili jisase police ke haath-paanv phool gaye
 Sriprakash Shukla took the betel nut of the then Chief Minister of UP Kalyan Singh
 6 karod rupee main siem kii supaari lene kii khabar estf ke liye bam girane jaisi thi
 The use of mobile surveillance STF came into action and he also decided that now it is necessary to catch Sriprakash Shukla under any circumstances
 estf ko pataa chalaa ki shriprakash dilli main apni kisi garlfriend se mobile par baaten karata he
 STF took her mobile on surveillance
 lekin shriprakash ko shaq ho gaya
 He started talking to pcos instead of mobile
 lekin use yah nahin pataa tha ki police ne uski garlfriend ke number ko bhi servilans par rakhaa he
 Surveillance revealed that the PCO from whom Sriprakash is calling is in Indirapuram area of ghaziabad
 khabar milte hi upi estf kii team fouran lokation kii taraf ravaanaa ho jaati he
 Such was killed Sriprakash Shukla On 23 September 1998, the in-charge of STF, Arun Kumar, gets the news that Shriprakash Shukla is coming from Delhi towards Ghaziabad
 shriprakash shukla kii car jaise hi vasundhara inkalev paar karti he, arun kumaar sahit estf kii team uskaa peechha shuru kar detii he
 At that time, Shriprakash Shukla had no doubt that the STF was following him
 uski car jaise hi indirapuram ke sunsaan ilaake main daakhil hui, mauka milte hi estf kii team ne achaanak shriprakash kii car ko overtek kar uskaa rasta roak diya
 The police first asked Sriprakash to surrender but he did not agree and started firing
 police kii javaabi firing main shriprakash shukla maaraa gaya
 And thus ended the story of up's biggest don
 kai netaaon or pulisavaalon se thi dostishriprakash shukla kii maut ke baad estf ko jaanch main pataa chalaa ki kai netaaon or police ke aalaa adhikariyon se uske shukla kii dosti thi
 Many policemen used to work for him
 jisaki evaj main unhen shriprakash se paisa miltaa tha
 Many leaders and ministers were also his allies

 The then minister is now jailed

 The police had spent one croremafia don, Sriprakash Shukla, who kept an AK 47 rifle with him at all times
 police ricard ke mutabik shriprakash ke khatme ke liye police ne jo abhiyaan chalaaya
 About one crore rupees were spent on it
 yah apane aap main is tarah kaa pehla maamla tha, jab police ne kisi apradhi ko pakadaney ke liye itani badi rakam kharch kii thi
 At that time the use of surveillance was also very expensive
 ise abhi tak kaa sabase kharchila police mishan kaha ja saktaa he
 2014 was very special for Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 is saal unki leadership main bijepi purna bahumat ke saath centre kii satta main ai
 After assuming the reins of the country in Delhi, on the strength of Modi, BJP also won states like Haryana and Maharashtra
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad modi america, australia, japan, myanmar, bhutan kii yatra par gaye
 During this time, his popularity was discussed in the domestic and foreign media
 2014 main narendra modi global leader ke taur par ubhare
 As a result, he came in the race for 'time Person of the Year' and topped the Readers' Poll, but he could not become 'time Person of the Year'
 2014 main unke phens ko yahi ek baat niraash kar gai
 No, this year, Modi played his name everywhere
 sawaal uthne lage ki agar readers pole ko maananaa hi nahin tha to time ne survey karaayaa hi kyon? jab readers pole main modi jite to 'ibola fiters' ko time person of da year kyon banaaya gaya? ye sabhi sawaal jaij hai, lekin time magazine kaa bhi apana itihaas rahaa he
 Let us know the factors that prevented Modi from becoming the 'time Person of the Year'
 
 
 readers pole main kya hua tha? narendra modi ko readers pole main 16 pratishat vot mili
 a total of 50 lakh votes were cast in the time poll
 modi ne fergyusan protestars, honkong ke loktantr samarthak joshua wong, nobel vijeta malala yusufajai or ibola fiters ko haraakar pole main sabase zyada vot hasil kiye, lekin vah final short list tak main shaamil nahin kiye gaye
 Short list of time included Jack Ma, Tim Cook, Vladimir Putin, Ebola Fighters etc
 'ibola fiters' kyon, modi kyon nahin? time magazine kii managing editor nancy gibs ne kaha, 'ibola ek war he or chetavanee bhi
 The Global Health System Failed to Control Ebola
 aise main kuch mahila-purush saamne aae or is beemaari se ladane kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 His sacrifice and dedication was a big deal, so Ebola became the Fighters 'time Person of the Year'
 2007 ke baad inhen chunaa gaya 'person of da year'2007 ke baad time ne rus ke raashtrapati vladimir putin, america raashtrapati baraak obama, mark jakarberg, pope francis jaisi hastiyon ko person of da year chunaa
 What is the reality of time? According to time, if a person leaves a particular, group, idea and object effect, then he can be chosen as Person of the Year
 is hisaab se dekhen to modi sabase baari the, lekin ek sach yah bhi he ki in sabhi ke centre main america hona chahie
 Time was among the people to whom the award was given at the time
 bhale hi modi kaa medicin squaire garden par rock star jaisaa welcome hua, lekin america par uskaa prabhaav zyada nahin tha
 He was definitely important to the people of Indian origin
 jis prakaar se tim cook 'ge' ke rup main saamne aae, fergyusan, ibola, putin, obama ye sabhi america ko choote hai
 In such a situation, the chances of Modi being elected 'person of the Year' were slim

 Voting is not a matter of editorial policy; voting is done for the 'time Person of the Year', this is true, but the final call is taken by a committee

 'person of the Year' was not to be chosen by voting
 yah faisla to time magazine ke editors kii chwis kaa he
 They have to take the last call

 But after not getting the desired results in the election results, this alliance was clouded by crisis

 Although Sharad Yadav has been called in this meeting, he will not attend this meeting
 sharad yadav nitish kumaar ke mahagathbandhan se alag hone or BJP ke saath jane kaa lagaataar virodh karte aa rahe hai
 He has opposed this decision of Nitish Kumar by meeting 'save Sanjhi Virasat'
 jab mahagathbandhan se nitish kumaar alag hue the, us vakt bhi sharad yadav ne nitish kumaar ke faisle par sawaal uthaaya tha
 So Sharad Yadav is unlikely to go to this meeting
 party ne unako rashtriya kaaryakarini main aakar apana paksh rakhane ke liye aamantrit kiya he
 These decisions will be discussed in the Moharis meeting, there will be discussion on separation from the Grand Alliance and Nitish Kumar's formation of the government with the BJP and then it will be ratified

 Nitish Kumar was proposed by the BJP to become the nda's Convenor
 jisko abhi nitish kumaar ne sweekaara nahin he
 But tomorrow's meeting will decide whether Nitish Kumar will become the co-ordinator of NDA
 iske saath hi yah bhi charchaa he ki modi sarkaar ke hone vaale mantrimandal vistaar main jediu shaamil bhi ho sakati he
 Waiting for Lalu's rally, however, the party leaders have not considered all the statements and activities of Sharad Yadav properly and where is it that Sharad Yadav has stood with corruption
 jabaki bhrashtachar ke khilaaf ladaai ladakar vah aage aae the
 The party has already removed Sharad Yadav from the post of Rajya Sabha leader
 magar party abhi sharad yadav ke khilaaf turant karrwai karne kii bajaay 27 agast ko lalu prasad yadav kii hone vaali raily kaa intjaar karne ke mood main dikh rahi he ki agar sharad yadav lalu yadav kii us raily main jaaenge to us vakt unke khilaaf karrwai kii jaaegi

 thawani ne kaha ki main mahila se apni galati jaahir karuunga or maafee maangoonga
 This is the whole controversy

 He said that the Telangana government made tennis star Sania Mirza a brand ambassador who is married to a Pakistani while unwilling to refund fees to the students who settled in Hyderabad ten or 15 years ago
 unhone kaha, ‘aap sania mirza ko doot kaa darja de rahe hai to chaatro kii madad kyon nahin kar rahe
 You are refusing the stipend and fees refund to those students who settled in Hyderabad 10 or 15 years ago
 lekin sania mirza ne pakistani se shaadi kii hai or aap use brands doot bana rahe hai
 We are not against brand ambassadors but are comparing the two issues

 In popular TV show Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, there has been suspense for a long time about Dayaben i
e
 Disha Vakani
 disha vakaani lambey samay se sho main najar nahin aa rahi hai
 There have been many speculations about his coming back or not
 kaha yah bhi gaya ki disha kii jagah kisi nae chehre kii talash chal rahi he
 Now another news is coming about the direction
 daawa kiya ja rahaa he ki sho main ab disha kii vaapasi kii ummid kaaphi kam he
 According to the discussions, Disha Wakani will not play the role of Dayaben in the show
 telechakkar kii report ke mutabiq disha or sho ke mekars actress kii sho main vaapasi ko lekar kisi samjhaute par nahin pahunch sake hai
 The production house has now proposed to bring a new actress to the show
 aise main mana ja rahaa he ki tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma ke darshak jald hi dayaban ke kirdaar main disha kii jagah kisi or chehre ko dekh paaenge
 View this post on instagramhappy bday @dilipjoshiee live long and god bless! a post shared bydisha Vakani (@dishaavakani) onmay 26, 2018 at 5:32 am pdtview this post on Instagram (@dishaavakani) onmay 10, 2018 at 12:00 am PDT Let us know that Disha Wakani is very much liked in the character of Dayaben in the show
 iske saath hi vah us kairactor kii unicness kii vajah se bhi charchaa main rahi hai
 In September 2017, Disha went on maternity leave
 iske baad se hi vah sho se gaayab he
 In November, she gave birth to a baby girl
 iske baad disha ne apni chuttee kii date ko or badwa liya tha
 She has not returned to the show since then
 bich main yah report bhi ai ki disha vakaani or nirmaataaon ke bich takaraar kii vajah actress ke pati mayur pandya hai
 It was told that Mayur had demanded from the production house that Disha would work only for 15 days in a month and these days she would shoot only 4 hours
 kaha yah bhi gaya ki unhone fees main 100 fisadi badhotaree kii maang bhi kii thi jo mekars ko pasand nahin aayaa
 With the victory of AAP, the most popular jumla that has come out is '5 years Kejriwal'
 yani ve is shandaar jeet kaa cheharaa hai
 And now this face will be needed at every opportunity
 kejariwal ab sirf dilli hi nahin, rashtriya raajnneeti main phir se praasangik ho gaye hai
 1
 kejariwal ne dilli main wo kar dikhaaya he, jo narendra modi or amit shah ne milakar loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan upi main kiya tha
 The BSP, SP was eliminated there
 yahaan bijepi or congress donon kaa
 In such a situation, Kejriwal's stature has become equal to Modi and Shah
 ve chahen to ek baar phir desh kii raajnneeti main ubhar sakate hai
 2
 aise main jab mana ja rahaa tha ki desh main modi lahar chal rahi he, dilli kii lagbhag 90 fisadi siten par jeet dilaane kaa sehara kejariwal ke hi sir he
 Modi and anti-bjp opposition across the country were looking for such a face
 ve chahen to yah cheharaa ban sakate hai
 3
 chunaav ke pehle se lalu, mulaayam aadi netaa aap ke paksh main bayaan dete rahe hai
 Now that Kejriwal has shown his own strength, all these can also make up their mind to give the leadership of the Third Front
 kejariwal chahen to yah netritv sweekaar kar sakate hai
 4
 kejariwal ko itani badi jeet unke kuch buniyadi vaadon kii vajah se mili he
 In this the elimination of corruption is prominent
 jab unhen yah abhootpurv bahumat mila he to ve is par amal bhi kar sakate hai
 5
 lokapal ke jariye kejariwal jis adarsh prashasan kii baat karte rahe hai, ve dilli main use amal main laa sakate hai
 Can make it a model state

 ’’ The Confederation of All India Traders (CAT) has demanded the demand of some e-commerce companies to be extended from 1 February 2019 to the date of implementation of the clarification issued in the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy of e-commerce recently by the government
 ) Has protested stating the absurd
 vaanijya mantralay ke diipipi vibhaag ke sachiv shri ramesh abhishek ko ravivaar ko bheje ek patr main cat ne is bare main apana kadaa virodh darj kiya he
 It has also demanded that under this policy, it should be clarified whether e-commerce companies can sell goods by private label or their own brand
 cat ke rashtriya mahaamantri praveen khandelwal ne sachiv abhishek ko bheje patr main kaha ki sarkaar ko kisi bhi dabaav ke aage na jhukkar kisi bhi surat main taarikh ko aage nahin badhanaa chahie
 He said that the Press Note-2 of the year 2018 is only a clarification of the Press Note-3 of the 2016 FDI policy and the policy has continued since 2016
 policy main koi badlaav nahin kiya gaya he, balki policy ko spasht hi kiya gaya he
 From this perspective, it is a mistake of the government to mark DIPP on 1 February 2019 and hence changing any date will be another mistake of the government
 khandelwal ne kaha keei-commersacompaniyon dwaara taarikh aage badhaane kii maang ek sochi-samajhi chaal he or ve isaki aad main policy ko lagu karne se rokna chaahate hai
 So that their business of selling goods at a price less than cost and giving big discounts will continue and they can take possession of the country's retail market
 unhone kaha kii sarkaar in companiyon ke kisi bhi jhaanse main na aae or kisi bhi haalat main taarikh aage na badhaai jaae
 Khandelwal also said in the letter that e-commerce companies play a big game of monopoly on the market by selling goods under private label or own brand
 sarkaar dwaara 3 janvari ko jari ek paripatr main kai shankaaon kaa samaadhaan kiya gaya he, lekin ek samaadhaan main praivat label yaa brands ko jari rakhane par bhram ban gaya he
 They have sought to clarify whether the private label or brand will continue to be sold under this policy
 agar yah jari rakhaa jaae to phir policy kaa koi matlab hi nahin rah jayega or i-commers main swasth pratispardhaa or barabari ke kaarobaari maahaul ko sthapit karne kii sarkaar kii manshaa puri tarah khatm ho jaaegi

 As a population, UP is the most populous state in India
 yahi vajah he ki bharat ke anya rajyon kii tulana yahaan ipies adhikariyon kii sankhya bhi adhik he
 As of 1 January 2016, there were a total of 404 IPS officers posted in UP, which is 21 percent less than the prescribed limit
 aapako bataa den ki uttar pradesh main ipies adhikariyon kii tainaati kii adarsh sankhya 517 he
 But still the transfer rate in the state is four times the national average
 uttar pradesh main ipies kii vardi pahananaa fakr kii baat ho sakati he lekin sukun kii nahin
 This is confirmed by the new figures of Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD)
 aankadon ke mutabik police adhikariyon ke tabadalon main 37 pratishat kii kami darj kii gai he lekin phir bhi 2006 se 2015 ke bich upi main ipies adhikari ausatan ek saal se bhi kam samay tak apane padon par rahe
 They were transferred before the police officers understood their city, and then the crime rate doubled
 aankadon ke mutabik 2007 se 2015 (2006 ke aankade uplabdh nahin hai) ke bich upi main 2,251 baar ipies adhikariyon kaa transfar hua jo ki bharat main hue ipies transfar kaa 43 pratishat tha
 Let me tell you that in the meantime a total of 5169 times IPS officers were transferred across India
 aapako yah bhi bataa den ki upi main ipies adhikariyon kii sankhya bharat ke ipies cader kii 11 fisadi he
 Tamil Nadu, at number two, will be surprised to know that there is no other state like UP in the matter of transfer of IPS officers

 Akhilesh made a quick transfer
 Let us tell you that in January 2016, Samajwadi Party Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav transferred 80 senior IPS officers including an Inspector General of Police
 agle maheene mukhyamantri ne ek ore baari tabadalaa list jari kii jisamen 12 jilon main tainaat 50 ipies adhikariyon ko idhar-udhar kiya gaya
 The special thing is that some names were also included in this list which were transferred in January
 upi main ipies adhikariyon kii lambii tabadalaa suchi koi nai baat nahin he
 Akhilesh government transferred about 100 IPS officers in March 2012 as soon as they stepped into power
 sabhi partiyaan karti hai transfaraisa nahin he ki ipies adhikariyon par transfar kaa yah julm keval akhilesh sarkaar ne kiya ho
 Previous governments have been doing the same
 beepiardi ke aankadon ke mutabik mayawati ne apane puure shasankaal (2007 se 2011) ke bich ausatan har saal kareeb 261 transfar kiye
 If comparing Akhilesh government's transfers with Mayawati's transfers to power, Akhilesh has averaged 163 transfers every year in his four years (2016 figures are not available here)

 saal 2007 main gorakhpur main hue sampradayik dange ke maamle main siem yogi sahit anya bijepi netaaon par mukadmaa chalaane ke liye daayar yachika ko khaarij kar diya he

 This petition appealed that CM Yogi and other BJP leaders be prosecuted and the case should be investigated by the CBI
 lekin hoicourt ke justise krishna murari or justise asi sharma kii divijan bench ne yachika khaarij kar diya he
 Let me tell you that 11 years ago, there was a communal riot in 27 January 2007 in Kogorakhpur
 is dange main do logon kii maut or kai log ghayal hue the
 For this riot, then MP and sitting CM Yogi Adityanath, MLA Radha Mohan Das Aggarwal and then Gorakhpur Mayor Anju Chaudhary were accused of making inflammatory speeches and inciting riots
 kaha gaya tha ki inke bhadakaau bhaashan ke baad hi danga bhadkaa tha
 An FIR was lodged against several BJP leaders, including Adityanath, after the High Court intervened in the matter
 is maamle main rajya sarkaar ne pichley saal adityanath yogi ko abhiyukt banane se ye kahkar manaa kar diya tha or kaha tha ki unke khilaaf koi sakshya nahin hai
 The decision was reserved on 18 December 2017 after a long debate by a bench of Justices Krishna Murari and AC Sharma on the petition filed by petitioner Parvez Parvaz

 The Modi government has failed to curb corruption incidents during its three-year tenure

 The then United Progressive Alliance government was forced to pass the Lokpal Act
 lekin use is sarkaar ne kamjor kar diya he
 Modi government did not live up to the expectation, Anna said that after this the new government came to power
 is sarkaar se logon ko bahut si ummiden or aakankshaayen thim
 But despite the passage of 3 years, the Modi government neither implemented the lokpal-lokayukta law nor took any concrete steps to curb corruption
 unhone kaha ki durbhaagya se sattarudh rashtriya janatantric gathbandhan sarkaar ne lokapal kanoon kii dhara 44 main badlaav kar ise or kamjor kar diya, is sthiti main ek andolan kii phir se jarurat he
 It is worth noting that recently, on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, Anna Hazare performed a one-day Satyagraha at Rajghat
 yahaan anna hajaare ne kaha tha ki 6 saal guzar jane ke baad bhi janalokapal nahin aa sakaa he
 The Modi government has failed to curb corruption and is not serious about Jan Lokpal and Lokayukta

 Kejriwal said, 'modi ji does not dare to ask Sonia Gandhi a question
 main kahata hum sonia gandhi ko jail main daalo, ek din jamkar poochtacha karo
 All the truth will be revealed
 'jantar-mantar par kejariwal kaa bhaashan-- ham maang karte hai ki degree kaa maamla saaf karen, modi ji logon se maafee maang len ki BA nahin kiya
 We need a true Prime Minister
 - italy ke order main sonia gandhi ke alaava netaa or afasar ko modi ji giraftaar karen, aisi hamaari maang he
 - We won the election and passed the Lokpal

 - hamane 49 din ke andar 3 exiaar shila ji ke khilaaf darj kii, ek saal tak modi ji kaa shashan tha
 - Both Congress and BJP are setting, Modi ji is saving the entire Congress
 - hamaare tomars sahab par aarope laga, police ne giraftaar kiya unke saath jo kaarywahi hui, kya vahi kaarywahi pradhanmantri ke saath nahin honi chahie
 - If the Prime Minister commits 420, the country will not tolerate it
 - pratibha degree kii mohataaj nahin he
 If Modi is 12th pass then please tell
 - jab BA hi nahin kii, to pradhanmantri ne MA kaise kar liya

 Why Modi does not send Vadra to jail after becoming Prime Minister
 - modi ji loksabhaa chunaav se pehle wadra par hamalaa karte the, kehete the congress ke damaad hai

 - gandhi parivaar ke paas modi ji ke kai sicrates hai
 - Why Modi ji is so afraid of Sonia ji
 - congress or bijepi ke bich bhrashtachar par mahagathbandhan he
 Modi did not dare to raid Kejriwal, but raid on Vadra

 - hamane aapako ection lene ke liye pradhanmantri banaaya, lekin meraa seenaa 56 inch kaa nahin hua
 The names of many Congress leaders have come up in the case, but Narendra Modi does not have the courage to ask questions
 - agasta westland se helicopter kharidne me bhrashtachar hua he, lekin 2 saal main 1 inch bhi maamle kii jaanch nahin badi
 - Narendra Modi said that 56 inch chest is there, but it has been 2 years, no one has been sent to jail
 - narendra modi ji ne shandaar bhaashan diya or logon ko ummid jaagi
 - Daily Congress scam came to light, followed by Narendra Modi in Lok Sabha elections
 - koyala kaa ghotaalaa donon party milakar kar rahi thi
 - 4 years ago today, we gathered to raise voice against corruption, on that day it lashed many sticks, but the anger of the people did not diminish

 In the political career of Indira Gandhi, known as the most powerful Prime Minister of the country and known as Lady Iron, the month of June was very special and very fluctuating
 elahabaad hoicourt ke faisle ke khilaaf indira gandhi supreme court gayi jahaan 24 june ko desh kii sabase badi adaalat ne pradhanmantri pad par unhen bane rahane diya, lekin hoicourt ke aadesh ko khaarij nahin kiya
 a day after this decision, Indira imposed emergency in the country
 25 june, 1975 ko desh main apatkaal ghoshit kiye jane se pehle kai ghatnaon ne isaki ruparekha taiyaar kar di thi
 It began on June 12, 1975, when Allahabad High Court judge Justice Jagmohan Lal Sinha, in his big and bold decision to this day, declared the election of Indira Gandhi as an MP from Rae Bareli illegal
 saath hi hoicourt ne agle 6 saal tak unke kisi bhi tarah ke chunaav ladane par roak laga di
 After Indiracourt's decision reached the Supreme Court 11 days later, Indira Gandhi had no way left to go to Rajya Sabha
 is kaaran indira gandhi ke paas pradhanmantri pad chhodane ke sivaa koi doosraa rasta nahin rah gaya tha
 On June 23, 11 days after the verdict, Indira filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging that the Allahabad High Court's decision be stayed completely
 indira gandhi ko 1971 ke chunaav ke liye ayogy tehraaya gaya tha (photo-getty)agle din 24 june ko supreme court kii greeshmakaleen avkaash peeth ke jaj justise viaar krishna ayyar ne faisla sunaate hue kaha ki ve hoicourt ke faisle par puri tarah se roak nahin lagaayenge
 But he allowed Indira to continue as Prime Minister
 saath hi yah bhi nirdesh diya ki wo antim faisla aane tak bataur saansad kisi bhi tarah kaa matdaan nahin kar sakengi
 At this time, political conditions were not going well for Indira Gandhi
 party ke andar or baahar har ore unke khilaaf virodh ke sur sunai pad rahe the
 Indira had to work hard to win the 1971 election
 isi chunaav main unhone 'garibi hataao' kaa charchit naaraa diya or isi naare ke dam par vah purna bahumat ke saath phir se satta main laut ain
 The Congress won 352 seats out of 518 seats in this boat and Indira again became Prime Minister
 chunaav ke 4 saal baad kesaindira ne raibareli sansadeey seat se chunaav ladaa tha or ek lakh se zyada voton se chunaav jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thim, lekin unke pratidwandi or sanyukt socialist party ke ummidavaar rajanarayan ne faisle ko sweekaar nahin kiya or indira kii is jeet ko elahabaad hoicourt main chunauti de di
 This case was very popular at that time, known as 'indira Gandhi vs Rajnarayan', but the decision on this election came 4 years later in 1975
 rajanarayan ne apane cese main indira gandhi par bhrashtachar, sarkari mashinari or sansadhano ke durupyog karne kaa aarope lagaaya
 Shanti Bhushan fought the case for Rajnarayan while Nanabhay Palkhiwala fought the case on behalf of Indira
 shantibhushan ne rajanarayan kaa paksh rakhte hue kaha ki indira ne chunaav prachaar main sarkari karmchaariyon or sanshadhano tak kaa istemaal kiya
 He cited the example of Yashpal Kapoor, the Prime Minister's secretary, who started working for Indira even before the president's resignation was approved
 or yahi daleel indira ke khilaaf gai or court ne janpratinidhitiv kanoon ke aadhaar par unke chunaav ko khaarij kar diya
 There were increasing attacks, meanwhile, the opposition was becoming united due to student movements in Gujarat and Bihar
 'lokanayak' jaiprakash narayan (jepi) ke netritv main vipaksh ekajute ho chukaa tha or centre sarkaar par lagaataar hamalavar the
 The opposition became more aggressive after the High Court and then the Supreme Court's decision
 desh kii sabase badi adaalat ke faisle ke agle din 25 june kii shaam ko dilli ke ramlila maidan main jaiprakash narayan (jepi) kii raily thi
 JP demanded the resignation of Indira Gandhi among the large number of people who attended this rally
 court ke faisle ke baad indira chautarafa ghirti ja rahi thim or kaha jaataa he ki vah kisi bhi surat main pradhanmantri pad nahin chhodana chaahati thim
 Meanwhile, at a rally in Delhi, JP made his slogan 'empty the throne that the public comes', a poem by famous poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, and based on this, Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency in the country at midnight of 25 June 1975 The decision was taken and an emergency was imposed in the country after it was signed by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed
 jediu ke endie se alag hone kii koi sambhaavna na dekh, lalu prasad yadav ke rashtriya janata dal (RJD) ne ab bihar main ek nae mahagathbandhan kii sambhaavna talashni shuru kar di he

 gauratlab he ki lalu ne agast 2017 main patna main yojit 'bijepi bhagaao, desh bachaao' raily ke dwaara gaiyr endie dalon ko ek manch par laane kii koshish kii thi
 But then BSP supremo Mayawati had declined the invitation saying that her party would not share the platform with anyone until the 2019 seat-sharing and coalition format was decided
 haal main mayawati ne is baat par jor diya tha ki bispi kisi bhi party ke saath gathbandhan tabhi banaaegi, jab use 'sammanit sankhya' main siten di jaaen, anyathaa vah akele ladegi
 After defeating BJP in UP by-elections by alliance with BSP, SP leader Akhilesh Yadav said that he was ready to make any sacrifice to maintain the alliance in the general election
 haalanki abhi bihar main kisi tarah ke gathbandhan kii pushti nahin hui he, jisaki vajah se bispi ke sthaneey netaa or kaaryakartaaon ne jamini str par loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 Encouraged by Mayawati's presence at the Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy Keshpath reception in Karnataka with all opposition leaders, an RJD leader is hopeful that a seat sharing agreement will be reached with the BSP in Bihar
 unke mutabik agar yah gathbandhan bana to upi-bihar ke border kii kam se kam 6 siton par iskaa acha asar hoga or baaki jagahon par bhi vot badhenge
 Significantly, in 2014 Lok Sabha elections in Bihar, BSP got 7
 65 lakh vot mili the, jo 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main badhkar 7
 88 lakhs
 haalanki use loksabhaa yaa vidhansabha main koi seat nahin mil pai he
 Apart from this, RJD is also considering linking CPI-ML with the alliance
 yah party rajya ke ati pichhadon or dalit samudaay main kuch asar rakhti he
 The party has already got the support of Jitan Ram Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha, which has some support base among the Dalits

 08% votes were added
 jitne log, utani baaten or shaayad utane mudde bhi
 Whichever government it may be, but amidst this political backlash, on Saturday, 1500 such fingers were knocked on the button of EVM, which is expected that their leader will not allow fingers to be raised on their identity
 vot ke jariye pahchaan or profeshan ko kanoonee banane kii yah jaddojahad rajdhani ke jibi road ilaake kii he
 The sex workers who vote in Delhi elections want a government in Delhi that honors their work and raises the issue of legalizing it
 jibi road ilaake kii lagbhag 1500 sex workars ne beete din utsaah ke saath vot daalaa
 On the condition of anonymity, a sex worker told that we need a stable government that will bring stability in our lives, take the initiative to legitimize our profession

 It was told that after a lot of efforts in 2008, the work of adding names of sex workers to the voter list had started seriously
 khaas baat yah he ki inaki apni kuch maangen hai, jinhen inhone pratyaashiyon ke saamne rakhaa tha
 Among these demands are health cards, hostel schools for children, job licenses, houses, cleanliness
 haalanki, sex workars kii badi taadaad aisi bhi he jinhen abhi tak matdaan kaa adhikaar nahin mil paaya he
 In this regard, there are many reasons such as not having the required identity card
 jibi road sthit kothe matiamhal or ballimaran vidhansabha kshetra main aate hai

 Encouraging Sachin Tendulkar, who has been under criticism for his continued poor form, former captain Sourav Ganguly has hoped that he will score a century in the third cricket Test against England starting on 5 December
 bhartiya team kii maujuudagi main hue ek kaarykram main unhone kaha, match ke bare main bahut kuch likhaa gaya he
 i wish Sachin the best

 Ganguly was accompanied by Tendulkar and Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on the stage
 ganguli ne yah bhi kaha ki bharat vaapasi karke shrunkhlaa jitegaa
 He said, the series is on par with 1-1
 mujhe ummid he ki bharat yah shrunkhlaa jitegaa
 In an event in the presence of the Indian team, he said, a lot has been written about the match
 main sachin ko shubhakamana detaa hum
 Hopefully he will score a century here
 ganguli ke saath manch par tendulkar or bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni the

 is2 oktober yani gandhi jayanti ke din 30 janvari yani mahatma gandhi kii punyatithi jaisaa ahsaas hua
 The state-sponsored attack on non-violence is more dangerous than Godse's gun
 mahatma gandhi kii sabase badi uplabdhi yah thi ki unhone ahimsa ke pracheen bhartiya chintan ko aadhunik bharat kii saamaajik, raajnneetik avadharana ke centre main laa diya
 It was non-violence in our national consciousness that did not let us stand in the long and difficult journey of independence
 shaareerik hinsa ke vilom se kahin aage kii cheez he
 This stems from our ancestors' amazing understanding of recognizing the true form of slavery
 daastaa ke vaataavaran main har koi kaidi ho jaataa he
 The exploited class is fear, lack, helplessness, the exploiting class craving for power and its perceived need
 shoshan se paidaa gussa, badale kii bhaavana or hinsa kaa jawaab hinsa se dene par samaaj kaa maahaul kharaab hota jaataa he
 Non-violence encourages us to fight against oppression
 ahimsa kaa rasta na daman karne detaa he or naa hi daman sahane detaa he
 Non-violence always makes us aware of humanity
 dar, laalasaa, nafrat or bhedbhaav ke chakra ko todatii he
 Ahimsa is the way of 'raj', that is, complete control over the self
 ye aisi avasthaa he jisamen shoshit ko shoshak se or shoshak ko shoshan kii aadat se chhutkaaraa dilaati he
 Teaches both the exploited and the exploiters to break the cycle of oppression
 har kisi ko satya kii khoj kii aazaadee mili, isiilie bhartiya aadhyatm kii baarik najar ne shuru se hi ahimsa ko apanaaya he
 Non-violence makes politics sensitive
 ahimsa samaaj kii sanrachana ko punarnirmit karti he
 So that society can assess its achievement on the basis of power and its participation in the hands of the weakest
 yah ahimsa hi he jo raajnneetik ichhashakti ke centre main sattahin, haashiye par dhakele gaye logon or alpsankhyakon ke liye jagah banaati he
 Non-violence establishes a political sanctity where the protection and inclusion of the weakest is implicit
 taaki kisi bhi paristhiti main yah aadharbhoot mulya khandit na hone paae
 Ahimsa brings compassion, compassion to power
 taaki satta ek-duusare ke shoshan kaa hathiyaar banakar na rah jaae
 May power be the medium to shape our common future
 aazaadee ke andolan se ahimsa ke prati samarpit netritv hamen viraasat main mila
 The election of our constitutional values is a powerful beginning to the power of non-violence
 hamaare desh kaa samvidhan nirmaan ghor garibi or asamanta ke daur main hua
 On one side there was a poor, destitute, illiterate population
 utpeedan se ubharate, sansthagat saamaajik bhed se jakade, raajnneetik sahabhaagita se vanchit garib the, to duusari taraf ek apekshaakrit chota shaktishaalee varg tha, jiske haath main puunji thi, bhoomi, shiksha or prabhutv tha
 India had not yet emerged from the terrible communal riots of Partition and the tragedy of the deaths of millions
 saamanyatya aise main satta kaa tark hota ki samprabhutaa sampann us thode se varg ko hi maukey kaa phayda uthaakar raashtra par apane ekadhikaar ko majboot karnaa chahie
 People in power could say that our only priority should be capital formation
 ham jan bhagidaari se upajati aakshamata ko bardaasht nahin kar sakenge
 He could also say in his advocacy that the direction of the poor, destitute, uneducated population to be given national direction is a big obstacle in the way of global competition and getting talent
 hamen yah bahut baari padegaa
 They could use the gruesome divisions to spread fear and discrimination
 apni suvidha ke mutabik kuch khaas samudaayon par iskaa dosha madh, unhen khatre kaa paryaay bataakar, unako samta ke liye ayogy, apaatr ghoshit kar sakate the
 Bapu was first told by Netaji that the 'father of the Nation' could justify the process of pushing the women and the proletariat marginalized by quoting ancient texts
 parantu jo kuch hua wo iske thik ulat tha
 Instead of using their influence to seize power or present such superficial arguments, the leaders gave India a path to equity
 ek aisi raah jisane ek laghu vishisht varg se uske betahasha aarthik, raajnneetik, saamaajik satta ko asankhya bejubaan jan ke bich hastantarit kiya
 As a result, we got a constitution that gives a legitimate, legal basis for the ambitious pursuit of empowerment and peaceful social revolution in human history
 samvidhan kaa harek praavdhaan, chaahe ek vyakti ek mat ek mulya, sabhi vayaskon ke liye matadhikaar, maukey or prabhaav kii samta, haashiye par khadey logon ke prati sakaaratmak sangrakshan, raashtra rajya ko ekal dharm se nirpeksh karnaa adivasee jan ke vishisht adhikaron ko manyata ho yaa vaigyanik aadhunik vichaaron kii pairvi ho, isaki pushti karata he
 Its effect was revolutionary and there was a direct attack on all traditional discriminatory structures
 hamaare purvajon ke in prabud chunaavon ke peeche kai kaaran rahe honge
 But the most important thing was that the constitution was framed in an atmosphere of non-violence-filled national political consciousness
 aamtaur par kisi bujdil ko diga dene jaisi abhootpurv chunautiyon or pralobhanon ke rahete hue bhi desh or uskaa pratinidhitiv karte netaaon ke paas yah vivek, badppan or vinay tha ki wo 33 karod aaazaad bharatiyon kii kalpana ko pankh de saken
 Give him an opportunity to come true
 yah maatr ahimsa kii mul bhaavana ke kaaran sunishchit ho sakaa
 By doing this, he not only led the country on the path of liberation, but also showed the path of compassion to the world that is moaning from the consequences of fascism, colonial slavery and world wars
 is peedi ne nihsandeh apane mustakabil kaa saamana dat kar kiya
 It was demonstrated that the leadership of the summit did not blossom with fierce aggression or slang
 varan karunaa, vinay or badppan se satta kaa sanchaalan kiya jaataa he
 It is very sad that our current relationship with power is just the opposite
 chunavi bahusankhya ne sabhi loktantric sthanon se muslimon ke hathaaye jane kaa purajor samarthan kiya he
 Most industrialists do not feel any discomfort in crushing the voice of the farmer to get the land
 kuch adaalatein vayask mahila ke dharm parivartan par hastkshep ko apana adhikaar or daayitv maanati hai
 State governments evict tribals from the land
 unhen koi muaavja dena to dur, unki apni pushtaini jameen ko hathiyaane se pehle unhen sunwaayee kaa mauka bhi nahin deteen
 All social leaders give their consent to the facility of building toilets by threatening to stop food i
e
 rationing
 jaane- note par mahatma gandhi kii hi tasviir kyon chhaapi jaati he?bhartiya naagarik ko maanav kavach banane ko sena apana purusharth samajhati he
 The list may be continuous
 yah log sabake pratinidhi nahin hai
 But undoubtedly this is the Amangalik period for non-violence
 hamaari aisi adhogati kaise ho gai? ahimsa kendrikrut satta ko sadaiv chunauti detii rahi he
 Past governments too have gone through the path of non-violence many times
 magar is maujuuda vyavastha ke dwaara hamaare saanjhe chaitanya se ahimsa kii nikasi kaa praytn ho rahaa he
 This has never happened before
 is pariyojna me naitik sukruty yaa tathakthith paavanataa unka prabal astr he
 The reason for this artificial moral pride campaign is made in such a way that no one can distinguish, no one can deny
 ’kya khule main shouch se samaaj ko mukt nahin hona chahie?’ kya aatankwaad ko samaapt nahin hona chahie? kya bhrasht ko dandit nahin kiya janaa chahie? kya hamaari bahan-betiyon ko suraksha nahin milani chahie?’ in prashnon ko milti hami kaa istemaal kisi varg ko lakshya kar kiya jaataa he
 The target class is said to be inferior and unworthy of compassion, and it is talked about keeping it in its place
 taaki samaaj kii kathith tarakkee baadhit na ho
 Black money collectors, open defecators, tax evading businessmen, beef eaters and distributors, non-hindi speaking, non-singing Vande Mataram, Kashmiri rocket, Azad Khyal students, truthful journalists and women who do not follow the so-called Indian culture Does, etc
 have a long list
 ek aisi suchi jo har prakaar ke purvaagrah, bhay or dikhaave ko hawa dene ke yogya kahi ja sakati he
 Each of these classes is targeted as a violent, intriguing moral campaign
 lakshith varg ko aniatikta kaa paryaay or sudhaar kii paridhi se baahar bataaya jaataa he
 So that the burden of introspection of his crimes is easily discharged, before anyone can impose his justice, he can avoid the trouble of putting himself in his place
 samasya ko jadmul se ukhaad phenkane ke antim aprihaary ekmaatr astr ke rup main is naitik yuddh ko pesh kiya jaataa he
 The end of the campaign of such importance is 'all is well'
 yani icchit naitik manzil ko paane ke liye bhale hi kisi bhi maarg kaa upyog kyon na kiya gaya ho
 Hence the association of moral warfare, certifies the person as a patriot
 isamen vyakti ko khud kuch nahin karnaa
 One has only to adopt hatred, adopt Hikrat, become a silent spectacle and get excited and soak the mental soot on the so-called guilty class
 taatpary yah ki is naitik yuddh main chaahe pal bhar ke liye hi sahi, hamen ahimsa ko maanas se ukhaad phenkna he
 The non-violence which Gandhiji used to live and for which he sacrificed himself, non-violence is disappearing from our subconscious mind every time through such a small campaign
 gandhiji ne desh ke pracheen paramparaagat vivek maarg kaa prayog bharat rupi raashtra rajya ke nirmaan hetu kiya
 a path that gives complete freedom to human beings to correct their own truth
 is maarg par aaj prahaar ho rahe hai
 They want to keep us in the cage of our own conceit, insecure, fearful dwarves armed with gripes
 desh kii bagdor khud ke haath main rakhana chaahate hai
 Our true tribute to Bapu on this Gandhi Jayanti can only be that we do not let our inner 'soul' fade away
 use mahanata kii ore le jaaen
 This is possible when we forget our ego and start embracing human beings
 ham unako bhi gale lagaaein jo aaj bhi godse ke vichaar vanshaj hai
 Accept them with love, compassion and humility
 nathuram kii goliyon ne gandhi ke mulyon ko nahin maaraa
 What his pills could not do, he could not create today's atmosphere of hatred
 yah tab jaakar kahin sunishchit hoga

 Did 90 per cent of the people be non-girls? Lalu Prasad asked PM Modi, were the 90 people who directly lost the demonetisation?

 rahul bowling, batting ke saath captaini bhi kar rahe hai
 The way Rahul Gandhi has changed the nature of advance organizations in the last 9 years as MP and General Secretary is a revolution in itself
 ab unhone congress kii jimmedaari sanbhali he
 In 6 months, his work will speak for itself
 ye batsuchana evam prasaaran mantri manish tiwarine aaj tak ke sidhi baat kaarykram main kahi
 Do not ask Rahul Gandhi a useless question! Manish Tiwari also said that Kirahul Gandhi has given blood to the youth after coming to the post of Vice President
 2014 main upie agar satta main aati he to pradhanmantri koun hoga
 In response to this question, Manish Tiwari said, 'elections are a year away, this year our priority is to strengthen the economy
 jo vaayade puure nahin hue unhen puraa karnaa
 Especially the promise of food security, women's empowerment and women's bill
 uske baad jab2014 kaa chunaavaayega, congress party ladegi or upie kaa gathbandhan jitegaa or pradhanmantri saamne aa jaaenge
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the PM in the country when we contested elections in 2004
 congress party chunaav jiti or upie kii sanrachana hui
 Rahul's words: Narendra Modi does politics of hate! On the question of Digvijay Singh's rhetoric about two centers of power, Manish Tiwari said that Digvijay Singh is a senior leader and he has his own opinion on different issues
 jahaan tak congress or sarkaar kaa sawaal he to pichley 9 saalon se samanvay or santulan ke saath hamane is desh kii arthvyavastha, raajnneetik pariprekshya ko majboot kiya he
 Rahul Gandhi is the captain of the Congress team, but this captain neither wants to bowl nor bat
 captaini to bilkul nahin
 This is not a problem for the Congress, in response to this question, he said that Rahul Bowling is also captaining along with batting
 har vyakti ke kaam karne kaa dhang alag hota he
 Many people work by talking and some speak their own work
 rahul gandhi ne pichley 9 varshon se saansad, mahasachiv ke rup main jis tarah se agrim sanghathanon kaa swaroop badla he wo apane aap main kranti he
 Now he has taken over the responsibility of Congress
 aap dekhiegaa agle 6 maheenon main unka kaam khud bolegaa
 You would say that they are aggressively batting and bowling smokelessly
 bijepi narendra modi ke chehre ko 2014 chunaav ke liye aage laa rahi he, lekin congress rahul gandhi kaa naam aage kyon nahin kar rahi he, is sawaal par manish tiwari ne kaha, 'jahaan tak meri jaankaree he to sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, rajnath singh, nitin gadakari in sabhi main antarkalah he
 The Congress party does not decide its strategy and political thinking on who is contesting elections from the opposition
 agar bijepi kisi ko aage karnaa chaahati he to ye unka andruni maamla he
 We will take people to work done in 2014
 centre sarkaar par sibiai ke durupyog ke sawaal par manish tiwari ne kaha, 'jahaan tak sibiai ke durupyog kaa sawaal he
 i was Tehelka's lawyer, Venkateswamy and Phukan commission
 jis din aapke paas vakt ho us din main aapako bataaungaa ki sibiai or ED kaa bijepi ne kis tarah durupyog kiya tha
 Mulayam Singh is a senior leader who says, i do not want to go into that
 vaise bhi har jaanch kaa aaropapatr adaalat main daakhil hota he
 The court decides on him
 pichley 9 varshon main koi aisa faisla nahin aayaa jisame ye baat kahi gai ho ki sarkaar ne kisi ko galat fasaanne kii koshish kii he
 This is false, baseless
 pradhanmantri joint parliament cameti ke saamne kyon nahin bulaae ja rahe, is sawaal par manish tiwari ne kaha, 'main sanyukt sansadeey samiti kaa sadsy rahaa hum or uski kaarywahi chal rahi he
 It is not appropriate to comment on that
 kuch sansadeey manyataayen hoti hai unhen ek taraf rakhkar main aapako kahana chahta hum ki ye baat uthi thi par ye baat isliye khaarij kar di gai kyonki jin saare kagajaat or dastavejon kii yashavanth sinha baat kar rahe hai, bijepi jo baat kar rahi he, wo saare dastauez maujuud hai

 The Shiv Sena chief instructed the BJP to keep its feet on the ground
 is par jawaab dete hue kendriya parivahan mantri nitin gadakari ne kaha ki party ke pair jameen par hi hai
 Remember that BJP and Shiv Sena are old allies but Maharashtra is running a tussle between the two parties on the issue of seat sharing for the upcoming assembly elections
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main behad talkh lahaze main bijepi ko naseehat di he
 He also described it as a lesson for Maharashtra elections, 'this lesson is for everyone
 janata ko apni bapauti nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Keep the feet on the ground
 jeet kaa unmaad na chadhane den or hawa par savaar hokar talwarbaji mat kiijie
 "not the cause of love jihad issue", he wrote, "those who take this lesson will only occupy Maharashtra
" anyathaa janata ulta-sulta karke chamadi chhil daalegi
 The Shiv Sena chief wrote that even raising the issue of 'love Jihad' did not help the BJP
 unhone likhaa, 'uttar pradesh main yogi adityanath main lav jihad kaa mudda uthaaya tha
 But it had some special result, it does not appear
 'haalanki shivasena pramukh ne yah bhi kaha ki upachunaav ke nateezon ko modi se nahin joda janaa chahie
 He wrote, 'the important thing is that (congress) won this victory because of Rahul Gandhi or Sonia Gandhi, no one can speak
 usee tarah yah modi ke khilaaf diya gaya janamat he, aisi bang bhi koi na maare
 "shiv Sena ready to fight alone in Maharashtra! Remember that BJP and Shiv Sena are face to face for seats in Maharashtra
" bijepi ne 135-135 siton kaa formula diya tha, jabaki shivasena 150 siton par pratyaashee utaarne ke liye adi he
 Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had on Monday rejected the bjp's proposal and made it clear that it is not possible to give 135 seats to the BJP
 sutron ke mutabik khabar he ki shivasena ne vidhansabha kii sabhi 288 siton ke liye apane pratyaashiyon kii suchi taiyaar kar lee he
 There is also a news that after the byelection results, the Shiv Sena is considering giving 145 seats under the new formula, while the BJP may get 125 seats

 Several important issues were discussed on the second day of the India Today Conclave
 pulavama hamale ke baad bharat ke dwaara kii gai airstrike se pakistan ke rukh main kis tarah kaa badlaav ho saktaa he is par leftinent general (rita
 ) DS Hooda made his point
 unhone kaha ki pakistan se nibatna sirf sena ke sahare sambhav nahin he, iske liye aapako raajnneetik ichhashakti or kootneeti ke raste par bhi kaam karnaa hoga
 He said that we had a surgical strike in 2016, but Pakistan was attacked even after that
 pakistan ke khilaaf ek niti hona jaruri he, sirf ek strike se kuch nahin hoga agar ham kadaa rukh apana rahe hai to use lambey samay tak aage badhanaa hoga
 DS Hooda said that we cannot celebrate just one strike for a long time
 unhone kaha ki bharat sarkaar ne pulavama main hue aatanki hamale ke baad jo ection liya vah majbootee bharaa faisla tha
 Pakistan needs to answer, for that the use of diplomacy along with the military is equally important
 ek lambii soch ke saath ek hi niti par chalanaa jaruri he
 Surgical strike hero DS Hooda said that military strength is only one part, it would be wrong to think if there will be anything with just Airstrike
 sainya shakti kii apni limitesan hai, isamen kootnithik shakti hona bhi jaruri he
 He said that there are always two types of thinking in Kashmir, some say Pakistan is a problem and some say that there is an internal problem
 lekin donon hi baaten sach hai
 You also have to admit that there is a big problem there
 jab rajyapal ne sarkaar ko hataakar, rajyapal shashan lagaaya, to main achambhit tha
 He said that the army and government have been on the same page for a long time in Kashmir
 jab sarkaar kii raajnneetik ichhashakti saaf hoti he, to usee ke hisaab se sena apni niti banaati he

 In some places it was successful but in Iran it failed
 iran main america kaa honeymoon period ab bas khatm hone vaala tha
 Because his velvet way to stand like a rock was Ayatollah Ruhullah Khomeini

 elahabaad hoicourt ke jaj ranganath pandeya ne apane ritayament se thik pehle pradhanmantri narendra modi ko ek chitthee likhi, jisamen unhone kaha ki nyaaypalika main jajon kii niyukti band kamaron main chaay par charchaa karte-karte ho jaati he
 There is no transparency here
 niyukti main bhai-bhatijawad or jatvaad haaavee he
 Which means that only children or relatives of judges become judges
 pariwaron ke cirkil se baahar ke logon ke liye sambhaavnaaen nahin ke baraabar hoti hai
 In his letter written in Hindi, he wrote that the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) had hoped for transparency in the appointment of judges
 lekin jajon ne durbhagyavash ise asavaindhanik ghoshit kar diya kyonki isse unhen apane paariwarik sadasyon kii niyukti main baadha nazar aane lagi thi
 This is not the first time a judge has made such allegations

 ise siddhant maanakar ab ham kahani par aate hai
 If it is easy to understand then we will see it in dots
 isamen sabase pehle mul masale ko sankshipt main samaj lete hai
 The bjp-led (previous) NDA government passed the law of the National Judicial Appointments Commission from Parliament to appoint judges
 supreme court or hoicourt main jajon kii niyukti or unke transfar vaale is ayog main 6 sadsy hone the jisamen bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish (CJI) ko adhyaksh banaaya gaya tha, unke alaava supreme court ke do varishthatam jajon, vidhi mantri or do janemaane logon se milakar bananaa tha
 These two people were to be selected by a selection committee made up of the CJI, the Prime Minister and the leader of the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha
 99waan samvidhan sansodhan kar aage badhane vaale is bill ko sansad ko donon sadanon se do-tihaai bahumat se paas karaayaa tha
 That is, the opposition was also there along with the ruling party
 itnaa hi nahin, yah samvidhan sanshodhan 368 ke tahat tisare tarah kaa sansodhan tha jisamen do-tihaai ke vishesh bahumat ke saath-saath aadhe se adhik rajyon kii sahmati bhi chahie hoti he
 Consent of 20 states was obtained in this
 lekin sansad ko donon sadanon se paas hone or 20 rajyon kii sahmati hone ke baad supreme court kii paanch jajon vaali sanvaidhanik peeth ne ise asavaindhanik ghoshit kar diya
 If it is understood in easy language, then how much public opinion was behind this bill, which was rejected
 - ham samvidhan kaa pehla panna nahin padhanaa chaahate lekin jajon kii niyukti par opinian rakhte hai
 "the Modi government is bent on curtailing the powers of the judiciary", saying 'happiness' was observed over the Supreme Court's decision declaring NJAC as unconstitutional
 - ham nahin sochate ki NJAC jaisi pahal upa-do (congress) ne bhi kii thi, vah iske liye vidheyak bhi laai, usee ke kaarykaal main ise standing cameti ko bheja gaya
 - We do not want to know that the UPA bill also had almost the same provisions as the NDA bill
 jajon kii niyukti ko nyaaypalika or karypalika kii sammilit bhagidaari se karne kii yojana thi
 His name was just a slightly different Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC)
 - ham nahin jaananaa chaahate ki samvidhan main kahin bhi 'collegium' kii vyavastha nahin he
 Leave the system, there is no word like collegium in the constitution
 - jajon kii niyukti nyaaypalika or karypalika 'sanyukt rup' se karenge, yah samvidhan ke mul main he
 According to Article 124 (2) of the Constitution, "after consulting the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts of the States, whom the President considers necessary to consult for this purpose, the President shall, with his signature and currency, by the warrant of the Supreme Court Will appoint the judge
 ''jajon kii niyukti vaale is anuchhed main saaf likhaa he ki raashtrapati ‘paraamarsh karnaa aavashyak samajhe', yani niyukti raashatrapati ko kerani he, mukhya nyaayadhish sirf paraamarsh denge
 But what would counseling mean? Whether it would be binding or just advisory, it was decided in the First Judges case when a three-judge bench ruled that consultation does not mean consent
 iskaa matlab raashtrapati sarvocch hai or ve salaah ke anusaar kaary karne ke liye baadhya nahin hai
 Till this case, the executive had an effective role in the appointment of judges
 ham ise baraabar hissedari vaali bhoomika bhi kah sakate hai
 If seen, this decision was in a way given by the judiciary against its powers
 lekin duusare cese ke baad kahani 180 degree badal gai
 - In Second and then Third Judges Case, you not only distanced yourself from this original soul of the Constitution, but also 'buried' the soul
 2nd jajes cese main jajon kii niyukti main raashtrapati ko di jane vaali 'salaah' ko 'badhyakaari' bana diya gaya
 This case overturned the First Judges case by 7: 2 by a bench of 9 judges
 - samvidhan nirmaataaon ne jajon kii niyukti main karypalika or nyaaypalika ke jis 'balance' kii baat kii thi, is cese ne na sirf taraazoo ke duusare palade ko todaa balki uske upar apni sarvocchata sthapit kar lee
 Till the First Judges Case, the Executive had a role in the appointment of judges, but the Executive had no role in the appointment of judges from the Second Judges Case, in which the Bench of 9 Judges decided that Supreme Court or High Court, the appointment of any judge in India
 Can be done only in accordance with the opinion of the Chief Justice, otherwise
 - Third Case main mukhya nyaayadhish kii isi raay ko 'collegium' kaa rup de diya gaya or ab mukhya nyaayadhish ko 4 anya nyaayadhishon se paraamarsh karnaa tha or bahumat ke aadhaar par chayan karnaa tha
 This collegium was born from here, which continues till today
 - saal 2013 main UPA sarkaar ne nyaayayik niyukti ayog (JAC) ke gathan ke liye vidheyak pesh kiya gaya tha, uski sanrachana hoobahoo NDA jaisi thi
 That too was to be a six-member commission, the difference being that going beyond the bill brought by UPA-2, choosing one of the known persons in the NDA Bill from among Scheduled Castes, Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Minorities and Women
 Was
 darasal, yah praavdhaan bhi pichley (UPA ke) vidheyak par standing cameti ke suzav par shaamil kiya gaya tha
 - If we leave NDA-UPA and go back, in 1987, the Law Commission suggested to create a judicial commission similar to today's NJAC
 1990 main is rashtriya nyaayik ayog ke gathan ke liye phir se vidheyak laayaa gaya
 - The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution, also known as the Constitution Review Commission in Saral Hindi, formed in 2002, also suggested the formation of a commission for the appointment of judges
 - saal 2005 main UPA pramukh sonia gandhi ke netritv main banane vaali rashtriya salaahkaar parishad (NAC) ne bhi isi tarah ke ek ayog ke liye suzav diya
 Finally, the Second Administrative Reforms Commission (2nd ARC), formed in 2007, also repeated this in its report
 - in sabhi aayogon / parishadon ne jis niyukti ayog kaa suzav diya, un sabhi main karypalika ko shaamil kiya gaya tha
 Except the Constitution Review Commission, everyone suggested that the Chief Minister should be included in the appointment of judges in the High Court
 sonia gandhi vaali NAC or 2nd ARC main to vidhayika ko bhi isamen shaamil kiya gaya tha
 - The five-judge bench of the Supreme Court declared NJAC brought by the NDA government from 4: 1 as unconstitutional
 (is peeth main shaamil justise je
 Chelameswar agreed with this)
