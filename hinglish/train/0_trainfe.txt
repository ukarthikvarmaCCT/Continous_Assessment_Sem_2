 bollywood kii mashhoor item girl raakhi saavant un tamaam logon ko hameshaa karaara jawaab detii hai jo ladakiyon ko item samajhate hai
 The problem of our society is that we do not honor any talent in time
 raakhi saavant ke mahaan yogadan ko bhi log abtak pahchaan nahin paae hai
 Recognize today, these are the 5 great plans of Rakhi Sawant on humanity
 
 
 lauto paramparaon kii ore:ek taraf jahaan hamaara samaaj west kaa 'west' tak uthaane ko taiyaar he vahiin raakhi ne gauravshaalee bhartiya parampara ko punerjeevit kiya
 Rakhi started the self-fulfilling tradition centuries ago
 yah sandesh zyada se zyada logon tak pahunche isliye raakhi ne ise baqayda neshnal televijan par prasaarit karaayaa
 Change the society: It is said that to clean the dirt one has to lift the broom himself
 haalanki jabase kejariwal raajnneeti main uge hai tabase is muhaavarey ko bain karne kii maang bhi uth rahi he
 Rakhi was not happy with politics, so she formed her own party and contested
 bhartiya voter ne gunaah-e-azim karte hue raakhi kii jamaanat jabt kara di
 Rakhi did not get as many votes as the people living in a colony
 garibon kaa bhala:log pichhadon kii baat to karte hai lekin unka sukh-dukh nahin baantate
 Rakhi did not see the sorrow of Abhishek, a poor man
 ab ladkaa jawan ho gaya tha to use god le nahin sakati thi so raakhi ne itihaas kaa shreshthatam balidaan karte hue abhishek ko apana bwoyfriend bana liya
 Although it is said that the monkey does not taste ginger, something similar happened with these people too
 raakhi ne baqayda lattam-juttam karke abhishek kaa chandan kiya
 Maneka of the New Age: Estimate the glory of Indian beauty in the old age by the fact that even the austerities like Vishwamitra, Brahmachari, disrupted austerity
 iske baad ferenes kriim ke daur main bhartiya aurat hinabhaavna se ghir gai
 Rakhi showed her blazing confidence and openly teased Baba Ramdev
 ramdev ne haalanki ki kai baar baalkrishna se kahalava bheja ki timatimaati aakhon kaa niyat se nahin sehat se conection he lekin raakhi to vahiin karti hai jo chaahati hai
 Beauty is not the creator, but in the hands of the surgeon: there are many fatalists in India
 is chakkar main tamaam thag baba desh ko kaate ja rahe hai
 In this era of science, Rakhi has done nothing to the extent of scientific thinking
 pehle log jo bhi miltaa tha use bhagwaan kaa diya maan santusht ho lete the
 Rakhi resorted to science
 sharir main jo ang pasand nahin aae unhen badalawa diya
 Kamasutra itself i mean Kama is the only sutra of Rakhi's life
 china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ko duusari baar sattarudh communist party kaa pramukh chunaa gaya he
 Also, members of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC) have also been elected
 paanch saal ke agle kaarykaal ke liye chune jane ke saath hi shi jinping china ke sabase majboot netaa ban gayi hai
 He will now remain President of China until 2022 next year
 itnaa hi nahin, vah saal 2022 ke baad bhi china kii satta main kabiz rahenge
 The reason for this is to elect older people in the Politburo
 ise shi jinping kaa satta main bane rahane kaa masterstroke mana ja rahaa he
 The new leadership was elected at the Communist Party of China (CPC) party, to be held in five years
 isamen party ke pramukh sahit paulitte beuro ke sadasyon ko chunaa jaataa he
 CPC voted 64-year-old Xi Jinping as chairman of the Politburo Standing Committee in a closed-door vote
 vahiin, china ke pradhanmantri lee kechiang saat sadasyeey samiti main apni seat bachaane main kaamyaab rahe

 ye chalaayenge china kii sarkaarichhfchh sammelan main chune gayi paulitte beuro ke sadasyon kii umr se ek baat to saaf he ki inamen se koi netaa shi jinping kaa uttaradhikari nahin banegaa

 Party chief Han Zhong (63) has been replaced
 baithak ke dauraan in nae commered ne 68 saal kii umr puri kar sevanivrutt hue sadasyon kaa sthaan liya
 Xi Jinping will remain in power even after 2022, usually one of the members of this politburo becomes the successor of the president
 haalanki inamen se koi bhi shi jinping kaa uttaradhikaar nahin banegaa
 The reason for this is that the new members of the Politburo are so old that they will not be able to succeed Xi Jinping in the party conference to be held in the year 2022 i
e
 it is clear that the second term of Xi Jinping will end in 2022, but Even after that, he will remain in power
 party kii neshnal congress ke baad shi jinping ne kiya sambodhitchin main paanch saal main hone vaali communist party kii neshnal congress ke baad paulitte sadasyon ke chune jane kii ghoshnaa kii gai

 Chinese President said to end poverty by 2020, Wadashi Jinping said that decades of hard work and Chinese socialism have entered a new era
 ab hamen nai uplabdhiyaan hasil kerani chahie
 During this, Xi Jinping talked about ending poverty by 2020 and building a modern prosperous society
 unhone kaha ki ham satat evam swasth aarthik vikaas ke prayaas karenge, jisase china or duniya ko laabh hoga
 He said that the party will not stop its development move at any cost

 It is to be known that till now the constitution of the party includes only the ideology of Mao Zedong and his official Deng Xiaoping
 deng ke vichaaron ko maranoparant party samvidhan main shaamil kiya gaya tha
 The inclusion of Xi Jinping's ideas in the Constitution made it clear that Xi Jinping became the most powerful person in China after Mao

 The Bombay High Court, while giving a major verdict on the beef ban issued in Maharashtra, had given a decision to continue the ban on July beef, but lifted the ban on beef eating and allowed it to be sold in Maharashtra from other states
 hoicourt ne apane faisle main kaha tha ki 'rajya main bif par pabandi jari rahegi, lekin baahar ke rajyon se (jin rajyon main isaki ijaajat he) maharashtra main bif laayaa ja saktaa he or log bif kha bhi sakate hai

 The petition filed in the Supreme Court said that bulls older than 16 years are of no use to the farmer
 aise main kisaan unhen bechakar paisa bhi kama sakate hai
 Lakhs of people have become unemployed due to this ban, so allow bullocking of bulls above 16 years in the state
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki is mudde par raajnneeti kii ja rahi he

 bif rakhane waalon ko saare saboot hameshaa rakhane honge, jisase kabhi koi shikaayat aae to wo khud ko nirdosh sabit kar saken
 In such a case, that person cannot be prosecuted

 com / ucciypqnmt 12 may ko hone vaale akhiri charan ke matdaan se pehle banaras main bijepi or chunaav ayog ke bich bheeshan bhidnt shuru ho gai he
 Angered by the lack of approval for Narendra Modi's rally in Beniabag, Varanasi, BJP has announced a satyagraha at BHU Gate today demanding the removal of the returning officer
 'ganga kii pukaar' par 24 april ko kaashi se parchaa daakhil karne pahunche bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi ne sochaa nahin hoga ki agali baar jab wo banaras pahunchenge, to bada sangram chhid chukaa hoga
 Today Modi is coming to his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi before the May 12 elections
 lekin yahaan kii jameen par paanv padane se padane se pehle kaashi ke kurukshetra main puraa sangram chhid chukaa he
 bjp's top leaders are preparing for Satyagraha instead of Modi's campaign
 kaashi ke siyaasi sangram buudhvaar ko us vakt garm or tej ho gai, jab varanasi ke jiladhikari ne suraksha kaarnon se shahar main modi ke kaaryakramon ko manjuuri dene se manaa kar diya
 According to BJP leader Arun Jaitley, on April 5, the party had applied for approval of these programs of Modi
 lekin aarope he ki jiladhikari bijepi ke aavedan par kundali markar baithe rahe
 Later, when the ruckus erupted, the District Magistrate late night gave the go-ahead to the other programs except the rally in Beniabagh
 lekin, bijepi ke mutabik tab tak uske paas itnaa vakt bachaa ki wo in kaaryakramon ko kar sake
 Therefore, the party itself canceled all of Modi's programs at his level
 ab modi aaj sirf rohaniya main raily karenge, jisaki manjuuri pehle mil chuki thi
 The demand for the removal of the election officer has also demanded immediate removal of the election officer and district magistrate Pranjal Yadav of Varanasi, who late night said that he had allowed four of the five programs sought by the BJP
 
 haalanki party ne is kadam ko nakaarte hue kaha ki yah anumati kaaphi der se di gai he
 While the BJP has attacked the Commission for not allowing the rally of bjp's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Beniabag, Congress sources say that in response to Rahul Gandhi Modi's rally in Amethi on Monday here Will hold a road show on May 10
 road sho ke liye chunaav prashasan ko aavedan diya gaya he
 The BJP accused the Election Commission of being 'quite partisan' over the role of the election officer in being a mute spectator and not allowing Modi to hold the rally
 nirvachan adhikari ne apni is karrwai ke liye sambhavit sampradayik tanaav sambandhi khufia report kaa hawala diya tha
 In the crowded Beniabagh area where the BJP sought permission to rally, there has been a record of communal tension and there is a possibility of law and order related incidents
 bijepi is baat par jor de rahi thi ki vah isi sthaan par raily yojit karegi, kahin or nahin
 Demanding the immediate removal of the party's Diggajvaranasi election officer Pranjal Yadav, who will sit on the dharna, senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley said that he, Amit Shah and other leaders will sit outside the Banaras Hindu University and outside the Election Commission in Delhi
 jetali ne nirvachan ayog ko teen lambey-chaude patr likhakar sawaal kiya he ki kya chunaav ayog nirvachan adhikari ke aacharan ko chupchaap sweekaar kar rahaa he
 In his fourth letter, Jaitley announced that all his Thursday programs in the city of temples have been canceled except for Modi's visit to the main office after a rally in Rohania on the outskirts of the party city
 unhone kaha, ‘in halaat main bijepi varanasi main teen kaaryakramon main se koi bhi yojit nahin karegi
 Jaitley, who camped in the area for the bjp's prime ministerial candidate, targeted the three-member Election Commission, saying, "democracy comes under threat when vulnerable people are in high positions
" ’ jetali ne kaha, ‘yadi rahul gandhi or arvind kejariwal varanasi main road sho or puja kar sakate hai, vahiin hamaare ummidavaar ko raily kii anumati se inkaar kiya ja rahaa he
 'permission granted too late: In the midst of this' war' between the BJP-BJP and the Election Commission, the Varanasi district administration allowed Modi's four programs late at night, but the BJP turned it down, stating that permission was granted too late
 
 is vivaad ke baad bijepi ne kaha ki vah jila prashasan ke ‘purvagrahpurn’ aacharan ke kaaran modi kii raily tathaa ganga aarti ko radd karne ko baadhya ho gai he
 However, the election official said that on the basis of the application of a BJP leader, Modi has been allowed to hold a rally at an alternate venue
 unhone kaha ki buddhijiviyon ke saath baithak or ganga pujan samet modi ke anya kaaryakramon ko manjuuri di gai he
 He said, 'they are deliberately making it an issue
 ’varanasi main 12 may ko matdaan se judi sargarmi tej hone ke bich bijepi ne aarope lagaaya ki varanasi loksabhaa seat se chunaav adhikari ke pakshpatpurna dhang se kaam karne ke kaaran party ko raily radd karne ko baadhya hona padaa he
 Modi will now pass through the city in a motor convoy after a rally in Rohania region, while Arun Jaitley and Amit Shah will sit on a dharna at Lanka Gate in front of BHU
 modi shahar se hote hue cigara kshetra main party ke chunaav karyaalay jaaenge or uske baad hawaii adde ke liye ravaanaa honge
 BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Harshvardhan will sit on a dharna in front of the Election Commission

 For the first time, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi has given a statement about not contesting from Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi Lok Sabha seat
 priyanka gandhi ne kaha ki mere kandhon par puure upi main prachaar kii jimmedaari he
 The party has the responsibility to win not one but 41 seats
 ek sthaan par rahakar aisa sambhav nahin tha
 Let me tell you that on March 28, when the workers of Priyanka Gandhi reached Rae Bareli to campaign for the former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, she turned back and asked the workers to fight elections from Varanasi
 The entire conversation between Priyanka Gandhi and Congress workers was informal
 priyanka ke is bayaan ke baad raajnneetik galiyare main is baat kii charchaa hone lagi thi ki priyanka varanasi se pradhanmantri narendra modi ke khilaaf chunaav lard sakati hai
 This was further strengthened when Congress spokesperson and MLC Deepak Singh also claimed that Priyanka Gandhi is almost certain to contest from Varanasi
 deepak singh ne kaha tha ki priyanka ne varanasi se chunaav ladane kaa man bana liya he
 In a day or two, the process of nomination from Banaras will be started
 lekin in charchaaon ke bich priyanka lagaataar kahati raheen ki vah varanasi se piem modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladane ke liye taiyaar hai, lekin bas party kii haa kaa intjaar he
 Regarding Priyanka's contesting elections from Varanasi, her husband Robert Vadra also said that Priyanka Gandhi is ready to contest from Varanasi
 unhen ab bas party kii haa kaa intjaar he
 Let us know that Varanasi Lok Sabha seat is one of the most VVIP seats in the country
 desh ke pradhanmantri narendra modi 2014 main isi seat se jitkar sansad pahunche the or 2019 main ek baar phir vah is seat se kismat aajamaa rahe hai
 Priyanka's discussions about contesting from Varanasi came to a halt on April 25 when the Congress gave Ajay Rai a ticket
 congress ne isse pehle 2014 main bhi ajay raay ko pratyaashee banaaya tha, lekin wo apni jamaanat bhi nahin bachaa sake the
 'priyanka Gandhi's decision not to contest elections from Varanasi', Congress leader Sam Pitroda had clarified the reason for Priyanka Gandhi not contesting against PM Modi from Varanasi

 Dismissing the criticisms of Baba Ramdev, Hazare said that he would talk to the yogguru as it is important to take the country forward together in the fight against corruption at this time

 Eminent lawyer Shanti Bhushan said that his son Prashant himself had raised the issue of the two of us being in the same committee but he said that it was Hazare who said that it was necessary to have experts in this committee

 Its pilot project was also started a year ago in Alwar district of Rajasthan before implementing the scheme from 1 January next year, but considering the reality of Alwar, this trump card of UPA 2 can become a reason for dissatisfaction against itself

 Regarding the plan, Bhajan Yadav, a farmer from Alwar, says, "what is good, a scheme to give money
" mazdooree chhodkar paise ke liye bank ke chakkar lagaate raho
 She doesn't even get it
 hamen koi phayda nahi he
 At the same time, farmer Shri Ram Yadav complained that for the first time he was given money
 uske baad to kabhi paise nahin mili
 He says, 'we also opened accounts in the bank but till today the money did not come

 The administration says that the people who did not buy kerosene with the money given have been stopped
 alvar ke rasad adhikari ramchandra meena kaa kahana he ki jin logon ne die gaye paise se kerosine nahin kharida unka paisa hamane band kar diya he
 The question arises that if someone is unable to take kerosene in any month for any reason, is it appropriate to cut his name from the poverty list

 Those who want to buy are blaming the government for this increased price

 secular hindutv kii paribhaashaisi asantulan ke bindu par ‘secular hindutv’ kaa panchi par kholane lagata he
 Secular Hindutva means that the leader will continue to try to show in his own color manner that he is completely Hindu, he is not an enemy of any minority community
 vah musalamaanon kaa dushman nahin he, lekin use muslim parast na mana jaae
 Actually, this is the undisclosed tradition on which the country has been following since the rise of Mahatma Gandhi
 isi parampara main alpsankhyak sabase zyada mahfuj rahe hai
 Just remember that Mahatma Gandhi never shied away from believing himself as a Vaishnavite, taking the Gita in his hand and expressing unwavering faith in God
 aadhunik secularvaad ke saanche main na samaane vaali paap-punya kii avadharana ko baapu ne hameshaa apane raajnneetik hathiyaar ke taur par istemaal kiya
 He made himself the leader of the Hindus before making himself the leader of the entire country
 agar aisa nahin tha to musalamaanon ko jodne ke liye khilaafat andolan se alag se judne kii unhen jarurat nahin padati
 Read further, when Gandhiji said- This trend of Pakistan na mange Gandhiji was clearly visible in the Congress Conference held in Bombay on August 8-9, 1942
 bharat chodo andolan kaa naaraa dene vaale aitihaasik yaa yon kahen itihaas ko gadhane vaale bhaashan main rashtrapita ne baar-baar musalamaanon se kaha ki hinduon kii ore se unhen jo chahie vah abhi unase (gandhiji se) maang len, vah abhi sab maangen maanane ko taiyaar hai, lekin pakistan kii maang na karen
 Bapu also demanded that the couple should not be against humanity
 yani gandhi ji desh ke netaa or vishwa ke vandaneey hone se pehle hindu samaaj main apni sweekaaryata banane main kaamyaab rahe
 And this success gave them an opportunity to remain in the minds of the Muslims who remained in India

 The reason for the staunch subsistence of this tradition was that the common Hindu of the country continued to consider Nehru as its leader and the minorities also felt their security in their hands
 lekin jaraa yaad kariye ki unheen pandit nehru ke pradhanmantri rahete or pandit govind vallabh pant ke uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri rahete ayodhya kii babari masjid main ramalala virajman ho gaye
 Despite being against lakhs, Nehru could not take a strong decision to remove the idols
 secular hindutv kii yah aprihaary khami thi, kyonki agar murtiyon hataa di jaatin to kattar hindutv waalon ko congress ko tabhi hindu virdohi manwaane main aasaani ho jaati
 Apart from this, the name of every establishment in Sanskrit and in every government program, such as lighting the lamp and bursting of coconut, Nehru himself followed the traditions
 hindu paramparaon kii secularvaad main is khuli lekin baarik milawat par alpsankhyak samaaj ne kabhi aitraaj nahin kiya
 In this way, this secular Hindutva continued
 indira gandhi, rajeev gandhi or narsimha raav sabhi chupchaap is line par chale
 However, Narasimha Rao could not handle the difficult discipline of secular Hindutva and the Babri Masjid was demolished in Ayodhya
 phir aa gai yaad
 
 
 Now in the most difficult phase of its existence, the Congress is again reminded of this secular Hindutva
 lekin kya ve log is asaadhya-veena ko baja paaenge jo kal tak osama ke naam main ‘ji’ laga rahe the yaa andolan ke charam par anna hajaare ke khilaaf ashaaleen bhashaa kaa prayog kar rahe the, yaa jo netaa anya naitik kaarnon se badi baaten bolne kaa munh hi nahin rakhte
 The country certainly has an interest in following the old rut, even if it weakens a bit on the theoretical debate
 aise main congress ho yaa duusari partiyaan unhen agar is puraani line ko pakadana he to aise chehron ko aage karnaa hoga, jinaki saakh samaaj main bachi he yaa phir jinako logon ne abhi aajamaaya nahin he
 More than that, the party leadership itself has to come forward and take command because they do not get hired to take the pain of someone

 # padmavati moharram kaa juluus nikaalane se rokane ke liye srinagar sahit kashmir ke kai hisson main ravivaar ko karfu jaisi paabandiyaan lagaai gai hai
 Authorities suspect that large religious gatherings may lead to violence
 adhikariyon ne kaha ki laal chowk ke vanijyik kendron or aas-paas ke ilaakon ko sabhi pravesh sthalon par tarbandi kar puri tarah se sil kar diya gaya he
 He said that restrictions have been imposed in many parts of Kashmir as a precaution to maintain law and order in the valley
 adhikariyon ne paabandiyon ko phir se lagane ke liye kisi bhi kaaran kaa hawala nahin diya, lekin mana jaataa he ki shahar or ghati main anya jagahon par moharram ke juluus ko rokane ke liye yah kadam uthaaya gaya he
 Only in case of emergency medical people are being allowed to cross the barricade
 surakshakarmiyon ne sambandhit adhikariyon dwaara jari karfu paason par jane kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya he
 Significantly, the restrictions were first imposed in Kashmir on 5 August after the Center announced the repeal of most of the provisions of Article 370 and divided the state into two union territories
 haalanki samay bitne ke saath sthiti main hue sudhaar ko dekhte huye ghati ke kai hisson se paabandiyon ko hataa liya gaya tha
 Meanwhile, normal life in Kashmir was badly affected on Sunday due to the ongoing bandh in the valley for the last 35 days

 Haryana Minister Anil Vij, who is in the news due to his statements, has once again targeted Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 nipah virus ko lekar desh ke kai rajyon main alert jari kiya ja chukaa he
 At the same time, the Health Minister of Haryana has given a controversial statement in this regard
 anil vij ne khatarnaak nipah virus kii tulana rahul gandhi se kar di he
 Anil Vijay said that even if the opposition unites, the parties that come in contact with Rahul Gandhi will end, because Rahul Gandhi is like Nipah virus which is very dangerous
 anil vij ne isse pehle 26 may ko twit bhi kiya tha ki rahul gandhinipah viraske samaan he, jo bhi raajnneetik party iske sampark main aegi vah phna ho jaaegi
 You had attacked Rahul earlier too, let us tell you that such bad words have not come out of Anil Vij's mouth
 isse pehle bhi rahul gandhi or mahatma gandhi ko lekar unke bayaan par vivaad ho chukaa he
 Earlier for Rahul, Anil Vij had said that the whole country was hoping that Rahul Gandhi would bring wisdom to his grandmother's house, but he seems to have returned empty handed from there
 nani ke ghar jaakar bhi unka dimag thik nahin hua he
 Anil Vij gave this answer when Rahul Gandhi questioned the terrorist attack during the Amarnath Yatra
 vahiin khaadi calendar vivaad ke samay mantri anil vij ne kaha tha he ki khaadi ke baad ab dhire-dhire noton par se bhi gandhi ji kii tasviir hat jaaegi
 He had said that since the Mahatma Gandhi photo was on the note, the price of the note started falling
 gandhi ke naam se khaadi patent nahin he balki khaadi ke saath gandhi kaa naam judane se khaadi dub gai he
 Its sales declined
 vahiin vij ne gandhi se jude ek geet ‘de di hamen aazaadee bina khadg bina dhaal, sabarmati ke sant tuune kar diya kamaal’ par bhi vivaadit bayaan diya tha
 Controversial statement about Gandhi cap (07 October 2016) Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij, who was in the news for his statements, said in October 2016 that Congress leaders should now wear helmets instead of wearing traditional Gandhi hats
 vij ne yah tippanee congress ke ek kaarykram main purv mukhyamantri bhupinder singh hooda or ashok tanvar ke samarthakon ke bich hue khooni sangharsh ke baad kii thi
 Tanwar and some others were injured in the conflict, they had to be hospitalized

 Anil Vij had said in a threatening manner that he would resign if compensation was given to the people who died in the Jat reservation violence

 The uproar caused by Anil Vij's statement on beef (12 February 2016)
 In February last year, another uproar by Haryana minister Anil Vij created a ruckus
 unhone kaha tha ki jo log gomance ke bina jinda nahin rah sakate, unhen haryana nahin aana chahie
 Vij's statement came after Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar's statement that there is no dispute over the ban on beef in the state
 haryana main saal 2015 main lagu hue ek kanoon ke mutabik rajya main gomance kii bikri nahin kii ja sakati
 When Anil Vij (27 November 2015) clashed with a woman officer, Haryana Health and Sports Minister Anil Vij, who was in controversy, shouted at a senior woman police officer during a meeting in November 2015
 unhone afasar se kaha 'get out'
 The police officer refused to leave the meeting and Vij himself got annoyed and had to leave the meeting
 darasal fatehabad main sharaab kii taskari maamle ko lekar afasar or mantri ke bich kii bahes main naubat yahaan tak pahunch gai thi
 Vij asked Fatehabad Superintendent of Police IPS Sangeeta Kalia to leave the meeting
 sangeeta ke manaa karne par vij gusse main baithak se chale gaye
 When Vij told Sangeeta 'get out', Sangeeta said, 'I will not go
 aap is tarah se meraa apmaan nahin kar sakate

 yah raily is myne main mahatvapurn he ki jab yah raily hogi tab tak madhya pradesh, rajasthan, dilli or chhattisgarh ke chunaav nattejey aa chuke honge
 That is, in Kashi, Modi will have a chance to show his attitude based on the election results
 sambhaavna he ki modi ke paas virodhiyon ko jawaab dene ke liye nae tark va aadhaar haath main honge
 Also, there will not be any confusion in front of him that if anything comes out of his mouth, he can damage the election campaign in the neighboring states
 aise main kaashi raily hi modi ke upi main loksabhaa chunaav abhiyaan kii vaastavik shuruyaat hogi
 So far in UP, Modi's 5th rally in saffron agenda has been kept away from saffron agenda, due to the land being part of the agenda of the Sangh Parivar in Kashi, will be different from other rallies
 gauratlab he ki kaashi ke vishwanath mandir ke uddhaar ke naare 90 ke dashak main logon ke sharir main shriram janmabhumi mandir uddhaar jaisaa karant daudaate the
 Therefore, it is natural for the curiosity of the people that Modi speaks the same language as the previous rallies in Kashi or his tone will be of some saffron color
 haalanki modi uttar pradesh main abhi tak bhagava agenda se kuch dur hi dikhe hai
 Be it the Bahraich rally or Agra
 unki raily ayodhya se lagbhag sau kimi
 Away in Bahraich then about 60 km from Mathura
 dur agra main hui
 But now on December 20, Vijay Shankhanad rally is going to be held in Kashi
 yahaan se modi loksabhaa chunaav ke asli maddon ko saamne laa kar bijepi ke chunaav prachaar ko behad aakraamak bana sakate hai

 elahabaad hoicourt ne dayaa yachika par faisla karne main 'atyadhik deree' ke aadhaar par varsh 2006 ke nithari maamle ke doshi surendra coli kii maut kii sajaa ghataakar umrakaid main tabdeel kar di
 a division bench of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice PKS Baghel said that Koli's execution of his death sentence would be 'unconstitutional' in view of the 'excessive delay' in deciding the mercy petition
 adaalat ne gaiyr-sarkari sanghathan 'pipuls union for democratic ritis' (piudiar) kii janhit yachika par yah faisla sunaaya
 This organization argued that it took three years and three months to settle Koli's mercy petition and in such a situation, execution of his death sentence would violate the right to live life as given in Article 21 of the Constitution
 baad main coli ne khud bhi ek yachika daayar kar is janhit yachika main die gaye aadhaar par hi maut kii sajaa ko chunauti di thi or is donon yachikaaon ko natthi kar diya gaya tha
 On February 13, 2009, Koli was sentenced to death by a special CBI court in Ghaziabad
 supreme court dwaara coli kii faisla waapas lene ke anurodh vaali antim yachika khaarij karne ke teen din baad yah janhit yachika daayar hui thi
 The lower court had issued a warrant of death on September 2, setting September 12 as the date for Koli's execution
 haalanki supreme court dwaara coli kii antim yachika par sunwaayee ke nirnay ke maddenjar uski faansee ke amal par roak laga di gai thi
 The dismissal of the final petition cleared the execution of the death sentence, but the High Court stayed the execution of the sentence on October 31, while deciding the hearing on the PIL filed in the case
 hoicourt dwaara 11 sitambar, 2009 ko nichali adaalat ke aadesh ke khilaaf uski apil khaarij karne or sah-aaropee moninder singh pandher ko bari karne ke baad, coli ne supreme court main doshasiddhi ko chunauti di thi, lekin 15 farvari, 2011 ko uski yachika khaarij ho gai thi
 Koli then filed a mercy petition before the Governor of Uttar Pradesh on 7 May 2011, which was dismissed 23 months later on 2 April 2013
 baad main coli kii dayaa yachika 19 july 2013 ko kendriya grih mantralay ko bheji gai or raashtrapati ne 20 july, 2014 ko ise khaarij kar diya tha
 Pandher and his domestic help Koli were arrested on December 29, 2006 after police found the skeletons of missing girls in a drain outside a house in Noida
 coli ne kai ladakiyon kii hatya karke unke sharir ko tukade-tukde karke ghar ke peeche or naale main phenkaa tha

 The Commission, taking cognizance of the news going on in the media, issued a notice to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Government of Delhi on December 4, 2015 and ordered compensation
 yahi nahin, muaavje main ho rahi deree ko lekar janvari 2018 main NHRC ne dilli ke mukhya sachiv or dilli police pramukh ko saman bhi jari kiya tha

 The Supreme Court has issued a notice to the UP government on the petition seeking to bring the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh under the purview of the Lokayukta and sought a reply from the UP government in 6 weeks
 yachika main pradesh sarkaar ko yah nirdesh dene kaa anurodh kiya gaya he vah kanoon main sanshodhan kar mukhyamantri karyaalay ko lokayukta ke daayre main laae
 The petition states that the current status of the Uttar Pradesh Lokayukta and sub-lokayukta Act, 1975 does not give the Lokayukta sufficient powers for the purpose for which it was constituted
 vakil shiv kumaar treepathi kii taraf se daayar janhit yachika main 43 saal puraane kanoon ko sanshodhit karne kaa nirdesh dene kii maang kii gai he, jisase bhrashtachar kii gatividhiyon par prabhavi niyantran sunishchit karne ke liye mukhyamantri ko iske daayre main laayaa ja sake
 The petition said that the Lokayukta of Uttar Pradesh does not have the right to take action if any Chief Minister is found involved in corruption, favoritism or nepotism

 Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that Cabinet Minister Satyendra Jain has started an indefinite fast
 bataa den ki kejariwal ke saath up mukhyamantri manish sisodiya, satyendra jain or gopal raay bhi dharne par hai
 In fact, the Kejriwal government's main demand from the Lt
 Governor is to direct the IAS officers who went on strike to return to work
 vahiin up rajyapal ne bayaan jari kar kaha he ki sarkaar ne hadtaal par gaye adhikariyon ke saath matbhedon ko hal karne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya he
 In response to the Deputy Governor's statement, another letter has been issued by the Delhi government
 is patr main beuroperesi ke saath matbhedon ko nipataane ke liye kiye gaye prayaason kaa zikr kiya gaya he
 The matter started like this - Kejriwal reached his office on Monday to meet the Lieutenant Governor to get his three demands
 kejariwal kaa kahana he ki up rajyapal ne unki teenon maangon ko thukraa diya
 At the same time, in support of the Delhi cabinet's dharna, the Chief Minister's residence is also ready to sit for the party MLA and the actor

 aditya birla samooh ke chairman kumaar mangalam birla ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki sarkaar ko arthvyavastha ke liye company kar main katautee se bhi aage badhkar kaam karne or arthvyavastha ke liye thos rajkoshiya protsaahan uplabdh karaane kii aavashyaktaa he
 He said that there should be fiscal prudence in business, but at present, there is also a need for a fiscal policy that will help in dealing with the softening
 birla ne media ke ek kaarykram main kaha, ‘main pehle hi kah rahaa hum ki arthshaastri nahin hum lekin mujhe lagata he ki ham rasaatal ke kareeb pahunch gayi hai
 
 
 Right now, there is a need to provide large-scale fiscal incentives from the government to the economy

 The Reserve Bank on Thursday estimated the economic growth rate for the current financial year in view of weak domestic and foreign demand
 1 pratishat se ghataakar 5 pratishat kar diya
 He said that the government needs to do more than cut the company tax
 bataa den, sarkaar ne chhot kaa daawa nahin karne vaali companiyon ke liye mul company kar 30 pratishat se ghataakar 22 pratishat kar diya
 At the same time, the tax rate for new manufacturing companies has been reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent
 iske alaava sarkaar ne kaarobaar sugam banane tathaa pratyaksh videshi nivesh badhaane ko lekar bhi kadam uthaaye hai
 Also, 10 banks were merged into four banks to strengthen the banks
 birla ne kaha, ‘kar katautee kaa hameshaa swaagat he
 If the government decides to give us more tax exemption, that would be welcome
 isse hamaara nakad pravaah badhegaa
 The government has done a lot
 main isse inkaar nahin karata
 But it can also provide fiscal stimulus on a large scale
 ' Mother of Goddess of happiness and contentment is Ganesh, father and riddhi-siddhi

 With the wish of happiness and good luck, there is a law for fasting of Mother Santoshi till 16 Friday
 maa kii vrath-katha is prakaar haiek budhiya thi
 He had only one son
 budhiya putr ke vivaah ke baad bahu se ghar ke saare kaam karwaati, parantu use thik se khaanaa nahin detii thi
 All this boy would see but could not say anything to the mother
 bahu dinabhar kaam main lagi rahati- upale thapati, roti-rasoi karti, bartan saaf karti, kapade dhoti or isi main uskaa sara samay biit jaataa
 One day thoughtfully, the boy said to the mother- 'mother, i am going to a foreign country
 ́ maa ko bete kii baat pasand aa gai tathaa use jane kii ajna de di
 After this, he went to his wife and said- 'I am going to Pardes
 apni kuch nishaani de de
 Bahu said- 'I have nothing to mark
 yah kahkar vah pati ke charnon main girakar rone lagi
 This made the impression on the husband's shoes with hands mixed with cow dung
 putr ke jane baad saas ke atyaachaar badhate gaye
 One day the daughter-in-law became sad and went to the temple
 vahaan usne dekha ki bahut-si striyaan puja kar rahi thim
 When she got information about the fast from women, she said that we are fasting for Santoshi Mata
 isse sabhi prakaar ke kashton kaa naash hota he
 Women said - take a pure water in a lotus on Friday, take a bath, take a Prasad of jaggery and gram and worship the mother with a sincere heart
 khatai bhul kar bhi mat khaanaa or na hi kisi ko dena
 Eating once
 vrath vidhaan sunakar ab vah prati shuukravaar ko sanyam se vrath karne lagi
 a few days later the husband's letter arrived at the grace of mother
 kuch dinon baad paisa bhi aa gaya
 She fasted again with a happy heart and went to the temple and said to other women - `` By the grace of Santoshi mother, we have received the husband's letter and money
 ́ anya sabhi striyaan bhi shraddha se vrath karne lageen
 The daughter-in-law said- 'O mother! When my husband comes home, i will promote your fast
 ́ab ek raat santoshi maa ne uske pati ko swapn diya or kaha ki tum apane ghar kyon nahin jate? to vah kehane laga- seth kaa sara saamaan abhi bika nahin
 The money has not even arrived yet
 usne seth ko swapn kii sari baat kahi tathaa ghar jane kii ijaajat maangi
 But Seth refused
 maa kii krupa se kai vyapaaree aae, sona-chaandi tathaa anya saamaan kharidkar le gaye
 The debtors also returned the money
 ab to sahuukaar ne use ghar jane kii ijaajat de di
 On coming home, the son gave a lot of money to his mother and wife
 patni ne kaha ki mujhe santoshi mata ke vrath kaa udhyapan karnaa he
 He invited everyone and made all the preparations for the industry
 pados kii ek stri use sukhi dekh ishrya karne lagi thi
 He taught his children that you must ask for a meal during the meal
 udhyapan ke samay khaanaa khate-khate bachche khatai ke liye machal uthe
 So the daughter-in-law entertained them by giving money
 bachche dukaan se un paison kii imali-khatai kharidkar khaane lage
 So mother in law wrathed
 raja ke doot uske pati ko pakadakar le jane lage
 If someone told that the children had eaten the tamarind of money in the education, then the daughter-in-law resolved to take the vow again
 sankalp ke baad vah mandir se nikali to raah main pati aata dikhaai diya
 Husband said - The king had asked for tax for the money he has earned
 agle shuukravaar ko usne phir vidhivat vrath kaa udhyapan kiya
 Santoshi mother was happy with this
 naumah baad chand-sa sundar putr hua
 Now mother-in-law, daughter-in-law and son started living happily with the grace of mother

 Manish Sisodia said in a tweet, 'why is this' open challenge' coming to the media instead of being 'leaked' instead of coming out in the open? So far there is no letter from the Election Commission or press release! He has said that when there are reports in the media through the Election Commission that the Election Commission is ready to get its EVM machine tested, then why is it publicly disclosing it
 aakhir media main sutron ke hawaale se khabaren kyon aa rahi hai
 Why not the Election Commission issues a press note

 As the BJP weakened in the election results, Shiv Sena Havishivasena's eyes are now almost clear in the Assembly elections held in the Chief Minister's chair Paramharashtra and Haryana
 maharashtra main jahaan bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan ek baar phir satta par kabiz hone ja rahaa he to vahiin haryana main pech funs gaya he
 No party has got a majority here, but the BJP is coming out as the largest party
 haryana main bahumat ke liye 46 siten chahie or bijepi ke paas 40 siten hai
 In such a situation, it needs 6 more mlas for the magic figure, which the BJP will not have to face much difficulty in achieving
 lekin haryana ke mukaable maharashtra main bijepi ko sarkaar banane main zyada mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padaa saktaa he
 In fact, 10 seats are going to the account of others in Haryana
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki in 10 vidhayakon main se 5 se 6 vidhayak bijepi ke baagi hai jo nirdaleey chunaav lade the or sarkaar banane ke liye bijepi ko samarthan de sakate hai
 It is a matter of relief for the BJP in Haryana that it is getting support of the one year old party Jananayak Janata Party (JJP)
 sutron ke mutabik, khabar he ki haryana main dushyant chautaala kii party jejepi bijepi ko samarthan degi
 However, the BJP does not need it, because by giving ministers to independent mlas, the BJP can get their support
 aise main haryana main bijepi ko sarkaar banane main zyada mushkil nahin hogi, lekin maharashtra main maamla thik vipareet he
 Shiv Sena is eyeing 158 seats in the account of BJP and Shiv Sena alliance in Paramharashtra, the chair of CM
 bijepi ko yahaan par 101 siten mili hai or shivasena ko 57
 As the BJP weakens in the election results, the Shiv Sena is now eyeing the Chief Minister's chair
 chunaav prachaar main jahaan bijepi shivasena ko bade bhai kii yaad dilaati rahi, lekin chunavi nattejey ab bijepi ko jhukne par majaboor karenge
 The Shiv Sena will now put its conditions before the BJP, whose trailer it showed shortly before now
 guuruuvaar shaam press conference karte hue shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne bijepi ko50-50 formulayaad dilaayaa
 At the same time, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said that he will follow what has been decided
 donon hi netaaon ke bayaan se saaf he ki ab jo ladaai he wo mukhyamantri kii kursi ko lekar he
 It is clear that Shiv Sena has got a chance to dominate BJP and it will not back down so easily
 ab sabhi kii najar shivasena par hogi
 Will she agree to the post of Chief Minister in the name of Fadnavis or someone else
 shivasena kii nazren ab mantripad par bhi hongi
 In such a situation, the BJP will have to do more for Maharashtra than Haryana
 team anna ko chande main mili do karod rupee kaa kya hoga
 This question has arisen because Anna Hazare has refused to take this money
 ek akhbaar ne apane khulaase main kaha he ki kuch maheene pehle anna se milane kejariwal ralegan siddhi gaye the or vah apane saath kareeb do karod kaa check bhi le gaye the

 Appreciating scientists like PM Bhargava and Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, Shourie questioned whether these people could be called fiery, a term Jaitley used? He said that these people contributed immensely to the country and those who attacked them did not read any book in the last 20 years
 'jo log do paragraph nahin likh sakate ve lekhakon par faisle karne ke liye baithe hue hai
 ' kisi bhi or har mudde par pradhanmantri se nahin bolne kii ummid rakhane ke bijepi netaaon ke baar-baar dohraye gaye bayanon ko khaarij karte hue shouri ne kaha ki vah vahi kar rahe hai or un muddon par nahin bol rahe hai jin par unhen bolnaa chahie
 He said, 'the Prime Minister is not the Section Officer of the Homeopathy Department
 vah koi vibhaagadhyaksh nahin hai
 He is the Prime Minister
 unhen desh ko naitik path dikhaanaa hoga
 They have to establish ethical standards
 ' Shourie cited Modi's tweets on issues such as the birthday of Union Minister Mahesh Sharma, the birthday of James Cameron, the stampede in Mecca and the Ankara blast shortly after the Dadri incident
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki lekin unhone dadri ghatana or haryana main do dalit bacchon kii hatya jaisi ghatnaon par chuppi saadhe rakhi
 He remains silent, while his party colleagues and ministers keep the issue alive
 yah puche jane par ki kya modi kii chuppi raajnneetik he, unhone kaha, 'mujhe aisa lagata he
 You cannot walk both ways
 aap bahut majboot netaa hai, lekin aap apane sadasyon ko niyantrit nahin kar sakate

 ' 'yah sachmuch main pratikatmak he
 In response to a question, he said that the intention is to win the Bihar election at any cost
 tippaniyan He said that Modi is not realizing the consequences of his silence and this fire will burn not only him but the entire country
 ye mudde desh ke saamaajik taane-bane main tanaav daalenge
 Shourie said that with his speeches on the quota issue in Bihar, Modi has brought himself down to the level of Lalu Prasad, while Nitish Kumar looks like a politician
 unhone bihar main bijepi ke haarane par pakistan main pataakhe jalaae jane ke bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ke bayaan ko bhi khaarij kar diya or kaha ki ab chijen alag hai
 In this context, he quoted a Pakistani analyst saying that fireworks have already been burnt there
 vah is baat se bhi sahamat hue ki modi or bijepi adhyaksh amit shah bihar main ek samudaay ko duusare ke khilaaf khadaa kar rahe hai
 He referred to a Pakistani analyst in this context, according to which the neighboring country is trying to overcome it while India is moving towards it

 Coming out in support of the writers and artists returning the award against the atmosphere of intolerance, he told Karan Thapar on India Today channel that he is the 'sentinel of consciousness' of the country and his motives cannot be questioned
 piem bhargav jaise vaigyanikon or infosis ke sansthaapak enaar narayanamurthi kii saraahna karte hue shouri ne sawaal kiya ki ye log ugr kahe ja sakate hai, jis shabd kaa istemaal jetali ne kiya tha? unhone kaha ki in logon ne desh ke liye apaar yogadan diya or jin logon ne un par prahaar kiya, unhone pichley 20 saal main koi pustak nahin padhi
 'those who cannot write two paragraphs are sitting to judge the writers
 ' Rejecting repeated statements of BJP leaders hoping not to speak to the Prime Minister on any and every issue, Shourie said that he is doing the same and not speaking on the issues on which he should speak
 unhone kaha, 'pradhanmantri homeopathy vibhaag ke section officer nahin hai
 He is not a head of department
 vah pradhanmantri hai
 They have to show moral path to the country
 unhen naitik maandand sthapit karne honge
 ' shouri ne dadri cond ke sheeghra baad kendriya mantri mahesh sharma ke janmdin, james camran ke janmdin, makka main bhagdad or ankara visphot jaise muddon par modi ke twit kaa hawala diya
 The former Union Minister said that but he kept silence over the events like Dadri incident and murder of two Dalit children in Haryana
 vah chuppi saadhe hue hai, jabaki unki party ke sahakarmi or mantri is mudde ko jeevant rakhe hue hai
 Asked if Modi's silence was political, he said, 'I think so
 aap donon raste par nahin chal sakate
 You are a very strong leader, but you cannot control your members
 ' purv raashtrapati abdul kalam par sharma kii vivaadaaspad tippanee kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha ki kalam jis makaan main rahe the use sharma ko aavantit karnaa 'logon ke munh par thukne jaisaa he
 "it is truly symbolic
" ' ek sawaal ke jawaab main unhone kaha ki iskaa iraadaa kisi bhi keemat par bihar chunaav jeetne kaa he
 The comments unhone kaha ki modi apni chuppi ke parinama ko mahasoos nahin kar rahe or yah aag na sirf unhen balki puure desh ko jala degi
 These issues will strain the social fabric of the country
 shouri ne kaha ki bihar main kota mudde par apane bhaashanon se modi ne khud ko lalu prasad ke str tak neeche laa diya he, jabaki nitish kumaar rajaneta kii tarah dikh rahe hai
 He also dismissed BJP President Amit Shah's statement of firecrackers being burnt in Pakistan after the BJP lost in Bihar, saying things were different now
 is sandarbh main unhone ek pakistani vishleshak kaa hawala dete hue kaha ki pataakhe pehle hi vahaan jalaae ja chuke hai

 After walking 25 km from Uttar Pradesh's Jhansi district headquarters on Kanpur highway, Richhaura and Parichha villages situated between Parichha thermal power plant and Betwa river are paying the price of development
 in gaanvon main aapako ek bhi maveshi dikhaai nahin padegaa
 Amar Singh Ahirwar, 30, of Richhaura village bought two cows five years ago
 par kuch hi din baad unki gaayen biimaar rahane lageen
 Doctors came to know that drinking polluted water of Betwa river is causing stomach pain in cows
 kuch hi dinon main amar kii donon gaayen chal bases
 The last of the three goats that Amar Singh received under the Bundelkhand package, died last week
 betwa nadi ke kinare faili raakh ko dikhaate hue amar singh kehete hai, "power plant lagane se gaanv main bijli to mili, lekin plant kii raakh ne betwa nadi kii saansen chin lee hai
 “as the Paricha approaches the power plant on the jhansi-kanpur highway, the roads leading to the thermal plant appear ashes
 makaanon kii chhaton par raakh kaa samrajya he
 The same ashes have also been filled in the breath of the 75-year-old Ramsevak living in Parichha village
 ramsevak tibi ke marij ban chuke hai, do varsh pehle unki patni bhi beemaari se ladate hue chal bases
 There are two young sons, who do not want to live in the village at any cost to their family, but Ramsevak is not allowed to leave his ancestral house
 is varsh hui acchhee barish ne kuch raahat di he
 Rainwater washed away the ashes of the frozen coal on the roofs, but it left no stone unturned to make Betwa flowing along the side of the village more "poisonous"
 bundelkhand main sthit keval parichha power plant hi nahin, desh main urjaanchal ke naam se mashhoor sonbhadra kaa ilaaka bhi taapagharon se nikalne vaali raakh ke dher main tabdeel hota ja rahaa he
 In November 2009, the Ministry of Forest and Environment of the Central Government ordered all thermal power stations to use 100 per cent of the ash emitted within five years
 sarkari aadesh kaa in taap bijligharon ne kis tarah makhul udaaya he "kendriya vidyut praadhikaran'' kii report hi isaki tasdik kar detii he
 According to the report, "national Thermal Power Corporation" (NTPC) Vindhyachal, Rihand and Singrauli heaters used only 60 per cent of the ash and the rest was dumped in the "ash dam"
 uttar pradesh utpaadan nigam ke anapara or obra bijligharon ne to keval chah fisadi se bhi kam raakh kaa sadupyog kiya or baaki raakh se aish dam bhar gaye
 According to the report, more than 9 million tonnes of ash is deposited annually in the dams in Urjunchal
 kendriya pradooshan niyantran board (sipisibi) kii 2017 main jari report ke mutabik puure uttar pradesh ke kul 18 taap bijligharon kii mahaj 43 fisadi raakh kaa hi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 By the way, the records of the use of fly ash in the surrounding states of Uttar Pradesh are also not much
 chhattisgarh main bijligharon kii raakh kaa 31 fisadi or madhya pradesh main 29 fisadi hi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This ash has made the lives of people hellish in the areas around the power stations
 uttar pradesh ke urja mantri shrikant sharma kehete hai, "vaayu pradooshan ke kaaran eent bhatthe lagane par paryaavaran mantralay sakht he, aise main power plant kii raakh se eent nirmaan na keval eco-friendli he balki isamen laagat bhi kam aati he
 The government is going to order all the thermal plants to set up a brick making plant with fly ash under their "social Responsibility Fund" (CRF)
 ''baandh se baahar bahati raakhparichha thermal power plant ke thik peeche sthit richora or parichha gaanvon main pasra sannata alag kissa bataata he
 More than half the people have migrated from these villages with a population of more than ten thousand 30 years ago
 parichha ke samajasevi mahavir singh kehete hai, "pani ke liye taras rahe bundelkhand main nadi kaa pani hi jaharila ho jaae to inke kinare based gaanvon kii haalat kaa andaja lagaaya ja saktaa he
 The Paricha Thermal Power Plant, which started functioning in the year 1984, now has six units, consuming 16,000 metric tons of coal daily and 14,000 metric tons of wet ash daily which is sent to the dam
 parichha thermal power plant ke ek adhikari bataate hai, "210 megawatt kshamta vaali ikaayiyon se nikalne vaali raakh ke liye bane donon dam bhar chuke hai jabaki 110 megawatt kshamta vaali ikaayiyon ke liye bane dam kaa ek kampartment bhar chukaa he
 Now the ash is being dumped in another compartment
 isamen bhi chah maheene tak hi raakh rakhane kii vyavastha he
 On July 21, a team of advocates of arbitrary superiors of officials and activists studying pollution were stunned when they came to see the management of ash from Anpara, the biggest project of Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Generation Corporation
 samiti ke sadasyon ko jaankaree mili ki anapara se nikalne vaali raakh rihand dam main jane se rokane ke liye lagaaya gaya "aish water ricycling plant'' pichley dedh maah se band he
 Shyam Kumar, who lives in Pipri, a village next to the Anpara project, says, "due to the negligence and inadequate care of the officials involved in the maintenance of the ash dam, the pipes in the ash water recycling plant often break
 jisase raakh na keval rihand jalashay main chali jaati he balki aasapaas ke kheton main bhi pahunchakar puri fasal nasht kar detii he
 However, Vinod Kumar, in charge of the ash dam of Anpara Thermal Project, dismisses the allegations of the villagers outright
 vinod kumaar kehete hai, "anapara ke teenon ricycling plant chaalu hai or rihand jalashay main raakh nahin bahaai ja rahi he
 Local social activist Ashish Choubey has complained to the National Green Tribunal and Environment Department about the problem of transporting ash from trucks to "ash recycling plant" from Sonbhadra's thermal power plant
 ashish kehete hai, "urjaanchal main shaktipur-kota maarg par power project se nikali raakh, jaale koyale ke avshesh ke saath kai tarah kaa chemical yukt kachra sadak ke donon ore phenkaa ja rahaa he
 Which has hurt the local environment
 '' adhikariyon kii manamaani ne 7 july ko vikaas yojanaon kii shuruyaat karne sonbhadra pahunche mukhyamantri yogi adityanath kii bhi kirakiri kara di

 Jagdish Parihar of Parichha village says, "the chemical ash found in Betwa has also affected the hand pumps in the village
 ab in handpampon se bhi pradooshit pani hi miltaa he
 "kuldeep Singh, head of Richhaura village, says," The river has become shallow due to the accumulation of ashes of 20 to 25 feet in the foothills of Betwa river
 jaraa-sa pani badaae par yah gaanv main pahunch jaataa he
 The Parichha dam on the river has also become shallow

 There is also a plan to build a new ash dam to hide the ashes of the last power house
 iske liye plant se sate gaanv maheba, gulaara or murata kii 572 acre jameen adhigrahit kii jaani thi
 In order to provide compensation to the farmers of the land, the Paricha Thermal Power Plant also got a loan of Rs 195 crore from "central Power Finance Corporation"
 lekin prashasan ko paryaavaran mantralay se anaapatti praaanpatr nahin mil paaya kyonki niyamanusaar dam kii jameen ko neshnal hive or nadi se 500 meter dur hona chahie
 But the distance between the Betwa river and the highway itself is less than 500 meters and it is the land to be acquired in between

 duusari ore, congress-jedies ke baagi vidhayakon kaa istipha abhi vidhansabha adhyaksh ramesh kumaar ne sweekaar nahin kiya he
 He has said to take a decision in this regard on Tuesday
 aise main congress-jedies kii ore se sarkaar bachaane ke prayaas bhi tej ho gaye hai
 Congress veteran Mallikarjun Kharge, Karnataka Congress in-charge KC Venugopal, g Parameshwara and MB Patil are trying to convince the rebels by holding regular meetings
 congress ke ye netaa ech di devgauda ke sampark main bhi hai
 Looking at the figures of Karnataka mlas, there are a total of 225 members and one of them is nominated
 philhal bijepi ke 105 vidhayak hai
 While the Congress formed the government with 80 of its mlas and 37 of the JDS, which was supported by one BSP and one independent MLA
 aise main congress ko 10 or jedies ke 3 vidhayakon kaa agar istipha sweekaar hota he bahumat kaa hisaab 210 siton par lagaaya jayega or kisi bhi party ko sarkaar main rahane ke liye 106 vidhayakon ke samarthan kii jarurat hogi
 At the moment of forming the government, the figures are showing in favor of BJP
 yahi vajah he ki purv mukhyamantri bies yediurppa sarkaar banane ke paksh main khadey najar aa rahe hai
 That is why he said that people in BJP are not 'saints' who will deny the possibility of forming a government
 yahi vajah rahi ki nirdaleey vidhayak nagesh ne somvaar ko jaise hi samarthan waapas liya to yediurppa ke pie unhen lekar mumbai ravaanaa ho gaye
 Its indications are clear that Yeddyurappa has become fully active to form the government
 haalanki bijepi kaa rashtriya netritv abhi bhi sarkaar banane se zyada 'wet and watch' kii ranneeti apana rahaa he
 The BJP may still succeed in forming the government in the current political situation, but the crisis will always be clouded
 sutron kii maane to yahi vajah he ki bijepi kaa rashtriya netritv sarkaar banane se zyada chunaav main utarane kaa man bana rahaa he
 The bjp's top leadership is not in favor of handing over the power of Karnataka to BS Yeddyurappa
 vahiin, is baat ko yediurppa bakhubi samaj rahe hai ki is baar agar wo siem banane main safal nahin honge to chunaav ke baad baaji unke haath lage yah jaruri nahin he
 Because Yeddyurappa is at the age of 76 years
 isiilie wo ye mauka apane haath se nahin jane dena chaahate hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections, BJP came into the fray with the face of Prime Minister Narendra Modi instead of BS Yeddyurappa
 iskaa party ko jabardast phayda bhi mila or bijepi karnataka kii kul 28 loksabhaa siton main se 25 siten jeetne main safal rahi thi
 That is why the top leadership of the party wants to enter the electoral battle in the current environment
 isse vipaksh ke sawaalon ke bachane ke saath-saath siyaasi laabh bhi mil saktaa he
 BJP seems to be stuck in this misdeed right now

 It is common to have problems with a partner after marriage
 lekin kai baar hota he ki ek hi chijen baar-baar rishte main aane lagati hai or rishta khatm karnaa hi behatar vikalp maaloom hota he
 Let's know the 8 problems in the relationship that are almost impossible to solve
 1- ek duusare par coment karnaa
 If both of you keep commenting to make each other feel bad
 yaa phir ek duusare par gande jokes maarthe hai or baat-baat par jhagada karte hai to rishte ke liye ye bure sanket hai
 Apart from this, the habit of degrading the girl's house also causes the marriage to break
 2- agar aapkaa partner aapse bematlab kii bahes karata he or yahi uskaa swabhaav he to shaadi ke baad hameshaa pareshaani bani rahati he or kai baar baat talaak lene tak pahunch jaati he
 3- Wives also keep distance from husbands with false promises and cheating habits
 4- agar pati aapse baaten chhupaata he to patni ko samasya hoti he
 Such habits disturb the other partner mentally
 5- sambandhon main ek partner kii lagaataar anichhaa kii vajah se bhi rishte tut jate hai
 Blood bank blood can be dangerous for such patients 6- Even if there is a lack of warmth in the relationship despite millions of efforts, the relationship is not good
 7- agar aapkaa partner puri tarah se atmmohi he to rishte main bahut sari samasyaayein aati hai
 Problems arise because of the partner just thinking about himself
 tuutane ke baad dobaaraa nahin aati neend? karen ye kaam8- agar rishte main dil kholkar apni baat rakhane kii azaadi nahin milti to rishte main samasya aati he
