 reality sho se zyada serials main najar aane vaale hitesh tejavaani ne big bos ke ghar ravivaar ko grand premier ke dauraan entry kii
 Hiten had a special chat with the India Today online team before entering Bigg Boss house
 PHOTOS: big bos main jane se pehle hina khan ne 'byfriend' sang manaaya berthdebig bos main entry karne se pehle koi stritji nahin banibig bos main entry karne se pehle unki stritji yaa plan ke sawaal par hiten ne saaf kaha ki unki aisi koi bhi stritji nahin hai
 He is also not one of the people making any plans in real life
 hiten ne kaha ki big bos ke ghar cervive karne kii baat aegi to vah contestant ke vyavhaar ko dekhte hue hi chijen plan karenge
 Hiten also said that it is not that he will stay away from any issues that arise in Bigg Boss house, he will definitely be a part of it
 om swami jaise kisi contestant sepadapala to karuunga ye
 
 
 When asked Hiten, what would he do if he faced a contestant like Swami Om ?, then he said that i should get an early elimination instead of planning or plotting to avoid a person like him
 Will do ye rahi Bigg Boss 11 ke contestant kii puri listbig bos house main entry karne se pehle mix imoshanhiten ne kaha, 'big bos sho main entry karne se pehle main jaanata tha ki jab main salmaan se miloongaa to mere andar mix imoshans kii feeling rahegi
 Because in that time i will be away from my wife and children but at the moment i am absolutely fine
 ' hiten ne is baat kaa bhi khulaasa kiya ki big bos main entry karne se pehle patni gauri pradhan ne unhen kya salaah di? hiten ne kaha ki gauri ne unase is sho ko jeet kar vaapis lautne ko kaha
 Bigg Boss 11: Bihar's Jyoti Bolin in Bigg Boss- i will play twelve of the urban girls, so Hiten, who appears in Bigg Boss entry reality show Nach Baliye 2, seems less inclined towards reality shows
 big bos entry karne ke peeche kaa kaaran bataate hue hiten ne kaha, 'mujhe big bos kaa pehle bhi ofer mila tha lekin tab maine iske liye hami nahin bhari
 This time i accepted this offer because this time i had time to participate in this show

 afasar ke khilaaf pratishodhatmak karrwai ke maamle main 25 hajaar rupee kaa jurmaana adaa na karne par donon adhikariyon ke khilaaf nainital hai court ne avmaananaa notice jari kiya he
 The court has asked to appear before it by 26 July
 yah bhi kaha he ki kyon na unke khilaaf avmaananaa ke maamle main karrwai kii jaae
 It is said that it is a rare case that when the court has taken action in the matter of torturing an officer of the government under his own command, he has been declared vindictive (retaliatory)
 magsese puraskaar vijeta bhartiya van seva ke charchit afasar sanjeev chaturvedi ne nainital hai court main daakhil apni avmaananaa yachika main kaha tha, "unhen (mantralay ke jimmedaaron) meri vaarshik gopneey report (ACR) main shunya dene main sirf 48 ghante lage, jabaki asiaar likhane ke liye teen maheene kaa samay nirdhaarit he
 At the same time, it took just 24 hours to remove him from the post of CVO of AIIMS
 kuch hi ghanton main tatkaaleen mantri se lekar afasaron ke dhadadhad 20 hastakshar file par ho gaye the
 At the same time, when it comes to complying with the lawful orders of the court in my case, those responsible become reluctant
 "hai court kii ore se jari avmaananaa noticekya he maamladansal, ames main mukhya satarkta adhikari(sivio) rahete sanjeev chaturvedi ne bhrashtachar ke kai maamalon kaa khulaasa kiya tha
 In 2014, he was removed from the CVO post by the Ministry of Health
 tab se vah uttarakhand ke haldwani main posted hai
 Meanwhile his ACR for 2015-16 was reduced to zero
 11 janvari 2017 ko soochna milane par unhone uttarakhand hai court kaa darwaja khatkhataya to court ne nainital cat jane kii salaah di
 Nainital CAT later issued notice to the Ministry of Health and AIIMS
 is par sarkaar ne disambar 2017 main dilli cat main cese kii sthanantaran apil kii
 a parallel case continued in Nainital and Delhi CAT
 is bich 27 july 2018 ko dilli cat ke chairman ne nainital cat kii khandpeeth kii kaarywahi par chah maheene ke roak laga di
 On which Sanjeev Chaturvedi went to Nainital High Court
 hai court ne cat chairman ke aadesh ko adhikaar kshetra se baahar kaa maanate hue na keval unhen notice jari kiya, balki centre sarkaar ke swasthya mantralay or ames prashasan ko bhi vindictive yani pratishodhi maanate hue 25 hajaar kaa jurmaana lagaaya
 The ministry and AIIMS did not later get relief from the Supreme Court either
 supreme court ne 25 hajaar or jurmaana badha diya tha
 Experts say that it is a serious matter to declare the ministry as vindictive from the court in the case of its own officer
 shaayad afasaron ne sochaa ki jurmaana adaa karne par lagegaa ki unhone galati sweekaar kar lee he
 Therefore, to avoid 'self-admission', he did not pay a fine of 25 thousand
 magar ab nainital hai court kii sakhti se swasthya sachiv priti sudan or ames ke diarector kii musiibat bad gai he

 The casting of the film is being praised everywhere

 But overall the film is getting mixed reviews by the audience
 norway kii ek adaalat ne do anivaasee bhartiya bacchon kaa sangrakshan unke chachaa ko saunp diya
 With this, the much-discussed controversy ended for months
 is dauraan bharat ne norway par rajanyik dabaav bhi daalaa, taaki bacchon ko waapas bheja ja sake
 The Child Welfare Service said that the Stavangar district court ordered the custody of the children to their uncle
 sarvice ne kaha ki jaise hi jaruri vyavasthaaen puri ho jaati hai, bachche apane chachaa ke saath bharat ravaanaa ho jaaenge
 The service said that after submitting a joint application in relation to the children, the court handed over the protection of Abhigyan (three) and Aishwarya (one) to their uncle Arunbhas Bhattacharya
 sarvice ke sthaneey pramukh gunnar toracen ne bhartiya adhikariyon ko dhanyavad dete hue kaha ki unhen khushi he ki vibhinn pakshon ke bich samjhauta ho gaya
 Indian Embassy and Foreign Ministry officials were also present during the hearing
 adaalat ke faisle par pratikriya vyakt karte hue bacchon ke pita anuroop ne kaha, ‘badi raahat
 
 
 i can't say how good i feel
 main is din kii pratiksha kar rahaa tha
 'he said that he has been told not to go to India with children
 is vajah se vah kuch samay tak norway main hi rahenge
 The case had several ups and downs and the court adjourned the hearing in March after news of the divorce situation among the parents came up
 baad main bacchon ke mata pita ne isse inkaar kiya tha
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh raised the issue with his Norwegian counterpart during the Nuclear Security Summit held in Seoul last month
 bharat kaa shuru se yah rukh rahaa tha ki bacchon ko waapas apane desh bheje jane kii aavashyaktaa he

 Excerpts from a special conversation with 'sultan' director 'ali Abbas Zafar' about this film's success: In three days, the film has crossed the 100 crore mark, what to say? Looks good, a director The happiest form is when people appreciate your film
 kaaphi acha mahasoos ho rahaa he
 What was the night before the release? i couldn't sleep because i had a screening just before that, then reached home and tried to sleep but didn't feel sleepy, then it seemed as if the school result was coming
 bilkul waisi hi feeling thi
 People were telling their views on Twitter
 bahut hi bhayanak vakt tha
 How special has 'sultan' become for you? i think i have tried to improve what i learned from my first two films during 'sultan'
 haalanki 'sultan' bhi sampoorn nahin he, wo bhi thodi or behatar ho sakati thi
 Does 'sultan' miss the moments of shooting? Everything feels like a dream because it was just struggle and hard during the shoot, and now the audience is appreciating it, feels quite good
 salmaan khan ko diarect karnaa chalange tha?itnaa mushkil nahin tha, unka itnaa shandaar anubhav he jisaki vajah se meraa kaam aasaan ho jaataa tha, ek actor or diarector kii relationships trust par kaayam rahati he or ham donon kaa ek duusare ke prati bharosa bahut zyada tha
 What was the most difficult filming of emotional, fight sequences, romance? i think it was the most difficult to shoot emotional things because it is something that can only be felt
 'sultan 2' kii taiyaari he?nahin abhi to aisi koi taiyaar nahin he, main to pehle hi haath jod chukaa hum
 So, there is no preparation for the next part
 aane vaali filmein?2-3 kahaniyaan hai, philhal mujhe ek chota brake chahie, phir sochoongaa kii koun si kahani par kaam karnaa he
 What message did Salman Khan get from seeing the audience's reaction to the film? We both have a heart relationship, i met Salman on Eid
 unhone mujhe jor se gale lagaaya, or maine kaha kii main chota hum mujhe idi dijie, to salmaan ne muskuraakar kaha, 'box officepar mil to rahi he, jaakar le lo
 "what's the best thing about Salman? His eyes say a lot
" bina kuch kahe hi wo bahut kuch kah jate hai
 Also, his smile is very good, which makes the mind happy
 kya controvarsi se film ko phayda hua?film ko controvarsi se kabhi bhi phayda nahin hota
 a fierce fire broke out in the slums last night near Mata Sundari Marg, adjacent to Delhi's LNJP Hospital
 aag se kareeb 500 jhuggiyaan jalakar khaak ho gayi
 100 wood shops were also destroyed by the fire
 aag bujhane ke liye fire ke 22 gaadiyaan maukey par pahunchi
 Fire crews had to struggle for hours to extinguish the fire
 chashmadidon ke mutabik aag raat dhaai baje kisi jhuggi se lagi or puure ilaake kii jhuggiyon or dukaanon ko chapet main le liya
 However, the fire has not yet been ascertained
 basti ke log iske peeche kisi sajeesh se inkaar nahin kar rahe
 Let me tell you that today it has been a hundred years for the capital in Delhi
 yani nai dilli kaa ye janm din he
 On this day in 1911, the British government shifted the capital from Kolkata to Delhi
 jiesti yani guds and sarvice tex lagane ke baad mobile bill, smartphone or computers par asar pad saktaa he
 Telecom may be taxed 18% separately
 jiesti council kii meeting khatm ho chuki he
 In this meeting, it has been decided to exempt education and health care from GST
 lekin isse smartphone mahange jarur ho sakate he
 Starting July 1, the entire country paying Central Excise and Service Tax will have to pay GST at these new rates
 itnaa hi nahin jiesti se bharat main bane hue handset thode mahange ho sakate hai, kyonki in par zyada tex lagenge
 In the current era, the Ipper 7 5 se 8 fisadi tex lagata ha par jiesti lagu hone ke baad ye 12 fisadi vaale slab main aaenge jisaki vajah se divaais kii keemton par bhi asar pad saktaa he
 This can also result in your mobile bill
 kyonki abhi telecom services main 15 fisadi sarvice tex kaa praavdhaan he
 But after GST it will increase to 18 per cent
 isliye phone bill main badhotaree ho sakati he
 According to ET, if you pay a mobile bill of 1000 rupees, then after GST, you will have to pay 30 rupees more
 reports ke mutabik jiesti ke baad aisa sambhav he ki bharat main banane vaale handset mahange ho jaaen or iske baad jaahir he emported divaais iske mukaable saste lagenge
 According to Cyber media Research, after GST, handset prices can increase by 15 to 25 percent
 haalanki is form ne yah bhi kaha ho ki jiesti lagu hone kaa samay isamen mahatvapurn role adaa karegaa
 According to Counterpoint Research, nearly four out of five mobile phones in the first quarter of 2017 are made in India
 yani jiesti lagu hone par local nirmaataaon par fark padegaa is vajah se mobile bazaar main mahangaai darj kii ja sakati he
 In Bihar, CM Nitish Kumar is on the target of opposition due to frequent incidents of criminal and mob litching
 yahi vajah he ki unhone buudhvaar ko mukhya sachiv dijipi or grih sachiv samet sabhi aaladhikariyon ke saath baithak kar rajya kii kanoon vyavastha kii samiksha kii
 In the meeting, the Chief Minister instructed the officers to decide the responsibility and said that the Police Headquarters should monitor it themselves
 meeting ke dauraan mukhyamantrimob linchingaurasampradayik tanavako lekar khaastaur par chintit dikhe
 He said that all the District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police should review it in their respective districts
 iske alaava logon se samvaad karen
 He further said that no laxity will be tolerated in the law and order of the state
 biharke siem ne kaha ki jo bhi kamiyaan hai, police thanon main use avilamb puraa karnaa chahie
 Whatever facilities are being provided at the national level, the Bihar Police should have all the facilities
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki aparaadh jaanch or vidhi vyavastha ke liye alag-alag timen banaai jaaen
 Speedy trial of charge sheet cases and communal cases should be heard soon
 mukhyamantri ne nirdesh diya ki kisi bhi thane main exiaar darj kiya ja saktaa he
 After this, there should be a system to transfer that case
 prayek thane main kursi or samachaarpatr kii vyavastha ho, rosemara ke kharchon ke liye thane ko paryaapt raashi uplabdh karai jaae
 Apart from this, two trains should be arranged in each police station
 siemne aage kaha ki aparaadh ke maamalon main thanon kii monitoring kii jaae or warrant kii samiksha kii jaae
 This monitoring should be at DGP level
 unhone kaha ki har paristhiti main bihar main kanoon kaa raaj kaayam rahe
 Take whatever facility is needed for this, but break the morale of criminals
 bataa den ki pehle ye samiksha baithak 4 sitambar ko honi thi lekin siem nitish kumaar kii tabiyat kharaab hone ke kaaran ise taal diya gaya tha
 But now Nitish Kumar is looking very serious about this matter
 bhartiya vimaanapttan praadhikaran (eeai) ke maamle main bajtiy aavanton 2017-18 main 149
 73 in 2018-19 from Rs 93 crore
 31 kar diya gaya he
 AAI will raise Rs 4,086 crore through IEBR

 Sharing a post like this and joining the global awareness on sexual assaults on women all over the world and showing solidarity to each and every woman who sailed on the same boat , shows the magnitude of the problem
 m surprised that some 'good' men are shocked to see the number of women who have come out and shared their # metoo experiences
 NO DON'T BE
 This is happening in your own backyard, in your own house, with your own sister, daughter, mother, wife or even your maid
 
 
 Gain their trusts and ask them
 You will be surprised at their answers
 
 You will be surprised with their stories
 
 Writing something like this brings me to tears reliving those memories as a little girl when i was scared of the neighborhood uncle and his prying eyes who at any given opportunity would grope me and threaten me not to speak about this to anyone
 
 
 
 
 OR my much older cousins who would eye me differently than their own daughters 
 
 
 
 OR the man who saw me at the hospital when i was born and 13 years later he thought it's appropriate for him to touch my body because i was a growing teenager and my body had changed
 
 
 
 OR my tuition teacher who had his hands in my underpants 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 OR this another teacher, whom i tied Rakhi to, would scold the female students in the class by pulling their bra straps and slapping on their breasts
 
 
 
 
 OR that man in the train station who gropes u 
 
 
 Why ?? Because you're too young and scared to speak up
 So scared that you can feel your stomach getting twisted inside and throat getting choked up 
 
 
 you don't know how are you going to explain it to your parents or you're too shy to utter a word to anyone
 
 
 
 And then you start developing that deep rooted hatred towards men
 
 
 Because you know they're the culprit who made you feel this way
 
 That disgusting, twisted feeling inside which takes years to overcome 
 
 
 
 m happy to be another voice joining this movement and make people realise that i was not spared either
 But TODAY i will rip apart any man who even remotely tries anything on me
 i AM PROUD OF WHO i AM

 Although six months and three months of bridal treatments are done in beauty parlors nowadays, but how good it is if you get that special glow from home remedies
 shaadi ke khaas din kii taiyaari karne se sabase pehle kuch baaten jaan lenaa aapke liye acha rahegaa
 The first thing is that your marriage is a happy occasion and any kind of stress about it can reduce your happiness
 isliye tanaav lene se bachein
 Its effect will also be visible on your face
 sakaaratmak rahen
 Apart from this, you can also look beautiful on your wedding day by adopting these small measures: 1
 saptaah main kam se kam paanch din 20 se 30 minute tak walk jarur karen
 Doing so will reduce your stress and increase blood circulation
 isse twachaa main nikhaar aayega
 2
 aaj se hi body sope ko by-by kah dijie or koi mild beauty phase wash kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar dijie
 Clean your face before going to bed at night
 3
 For the night time, choose a moisturizer that has anti-oxidant properties
 agar aapkaa moishcharizer vitamin e, si, i or bi3 se yukt he to yah aapaki twachaa ko poshit karne kaa kaam karegaa
 4
 koshish kiijie ki rasinic chizon kaa istemaal kam se kam ho
 Be sure to consult your dermatologist before using any product
 ek baat or - paise bachaane ke pher main kabhi bhi utpaada kii gunvattta ke saath samjhauta na karen
 5
 agar aapako bahut adhik pasinaa aata he or aapako dhul-gandagi main hi kaam karnaa he to har roj bal dhonaa aapke liye jaruri he
 Do not forget to conditioner the hair after shampooing
 saath hi baalo main tel lagaana bhi bahut jaruri he
 This does not make hair dry and lifeless

 june 1967 main chah din tak arab-isroyal jang hui, jiske baad israel ne philistin ke west bank, east jerusalem or gaja pattee par kabja kar liya
 All countries of the world, including India, have been fiercely critical of Israel's move to occupy Palestine and establish a Yahoo settlement

 However, in 1992, the then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao stepped away from his predecessor government and recognized Israel

 In 2015, President Pranab Mukherjee also visited Israel, but he had reached Jordan and Palestine

 India has often been in favor of Palestine
 isaki vajah yah rahi ki bharat kaa maananaa tha ki isroyal ke kareeb jane se kai arab desh naaraaz ho jaaenge
 If Israel gets a visa on your passport, then it becomes difficult to get visas from Arab countries
 haalanki pranab mukherjee ne is dharna ko todaa tha
 a large number of Indians work in these Arab countries and India is also largely dependent on petroleum products
 philhal bhartiya adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki bharat ke isroyal or philistin donon se ghanishtha rishte hai

 Former England captain Geoffrey Boycott feels that the Indian team is 'very average' at the moment but is 'lucky' that he has a captain like Mahendra Singh Dhoni who has been under criticism for 'lack of team level' is
 boycott ne kaha, ‘kya aap captainon ko unki jeet or haar ke anupaat se dekhte ho yaa phir aap team ke str ko dekhte ho? agar aap bharat ke bare main soch rahe ho to team main str kii kami he, team main tej gendbaaji ke str kii kami he, spin gendbaaji ke str kii kami he or aapke kuch khilaadi sanyas lenaa shuru kar rahe hai
 Isn't it so? "he said," Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman have gone, Sachin Tendulkar has not scored much runs recently, so is it Dhoni's fault? " Boycott said, 'I don't think so
 main logon ko team ke jeetne yaa haarane ke anupaat se nahin aankata
 You have to see the team
 bharat sach main bhaagyashaalee he ki uske paas dhoni he
 Dhoni has come under severe criticism after the recent home Test series loss against England, although he himself is in good form
 boycott ne kaha ki test captain ke rup main dhoni kii kuch simaayen hai lekin bharatiyon ke paas uski jagah laane ke liye koi acha khilaadi nahin he
 He said, 'I think he is a great one-day captain
 bahut logon kii tarah mujhe lagata he ki uske paas khilaadiyon ke kaushal kaa istemaal karne kii acchhee netritvkshmata he
 But technically, a lot more is needed in Test matches
 lekin aapke paas uski jagah lene ke liye koi or bhi nahin he
 Boycott said, "you have very good players but you are very average compared to other world level teams and you cannot win with an average team
" iske liye hameshaa captain ko doshi tehraaya jaataa he
 The captain is praised when the team wins, but i think that is unfair
 ’ unhone kaha ki dhoni ko team ke liye jimmedaar nahin tehraaya ja saktaa kyonki bharat aisi team he jo abhi badlaav ke daur se guzar rahi he

 puure desh kii tarah is parivaar ko bhi mumbai aatanki hamale ke gunahagaar aamir ajmal kasaab kii faansee kaa besabri se intjaar tha
 But even after Kasab was hanged on Wednesday, the family of the late Mammu Singh executioner is a bit disappointed, as Mammu Jallad's desire to hang Kasab by his hands remained unfulfilled
 mummu jallaad ke bete pawan ne kaha, ‘kasaab ko faansee par latakaae jane se desh ke duusare nagarikon kii tarah mujhjhe or mere parivaar ko bhi bahut khushi he, lekin thodi maayusi he bhi he, kyonki yadi mere pita jinda hote to shaayad sarkaar unhen hi kasaab ko faansee dene ke liye bulaati or phir hamaari khushi kaa thikaana nahin rahata
 Mmmu Jallad, who was posted as executioner in Meerut's Central Jail, had the last wish to hang Kasab
 apane jivan main kareeb 12 khoonkhaar aparaadhiyon ko faansee par latakaane vaale mummu kii pichley saal 19 may ko beemaari ke kaaran maut ho gai thi
 Pawan, son of Mammu, a resident of Bhagwatpura Colony in Meerut, said, 'my father was very happy when Kasab was sentenced to death by the court
 vah ishwar se prarthana kar rahe the ki kasaab ko faansee dene kii kanoonee prakriya jald puri ho or use faansee ke fande par latakaane ke liye sarkaar unhen bulaava bheje
 Given his experience in the executioner's profession, he hoped that the government would call him to hang Kasab
 'pawan ke mutabik, unke pita mummu kehete the ki kasaab ko faansee pakistani aatankwaadiyon ke liye sabak hogi or ve bharat main dehshatgardi failaane se pehle sau baar sochenge
 The profession of hanging Mammu was inherited
 unke dada angrejon ke jamaane se faansee lagane kaa kaam karte the
 After his death, this work came into the hands of father Kallu Singh, who hanged the killers of Indira Gandhi in 1989
 unke baad mummu ne yah kaam sambhaala
 For 40 years, Mammu had hanged the culprits
 unhone uttar pradesh ke alaava madhya pradesh, rajasthan, dilli main bhi aparaadhiyon ko faansee par latakaaya

 Kanhaiya Kumar has written a letter to the students of the campus during the JNU elections
 fasebuk par ek lambey post ke jariye unhone chaatro kaa dhanyavad kiya he, jinhone unhen chaatrasangh ke adhyaksh kii jimmedaari saunpi thi
 Kanhaiya said that it seems strange to say thank you while relieving the responsibility of the post of president, but he is grateful to all those who are with him at every stage of the struggle
 padhen, kanhaiya kumaar kaa thankyuu post jas kaa tas-saathiyon,jeenyu chaatrasangh adhyaksh kii jimmedaari se mukt hone ke maukey par apane logon ko shukriya kahana bada ajeeb lag rahaa he, lekin pataa nahin kyon baar-baar un logon ke prati aabhaar vyakt karne kaa man kar rahaa he jo sangharsh ke har mukaam par kisi na kisi rup main mere saath khadey rahe
 Thanks to JNUK students, teachers, staff, alumni and many well-wishers from outside the campus who joined the JNU Students' Union # standwithjnu's struggle against the forces that are holding society back to preserve equality, justice and democracy
 jeenyu or iske chaatrasangh ko badnaam or barbaad karne kii harsambhav koshish ke daur main aap jaise saathiyon ne unhen yah bataa diya ki jeenyu jis janavaadee soch ke saath hameshaa se khadaa rahata aayaa he uski takat tamaam dangaiyon or shadyantrkariyon kii takat se kai guna zyada he
 i remember that after winning the election of the Students' Union President, i took out the Unity March, not the Victory March (victory Procession), because i and my organization have always stood in favor of Unity
 or mere puure kaarykaal main mujhe un tamaam logon kaa sahyog mila jo kai masalon par mujhase vaicharik taur par asahmat hai
 The first protest in my tenure was in support of the struggling colleagues of FTII and the JNU Students' Union raised its voice in favor of the voices being raised against communal and fascist forces in all the camps across the country and after 9 February all these Voice of # standwithjnu echoed in campuses
 chaahe chaatravrutti ko bachaane ke liye ocupai ujisi kaa andolan ho yaa rohit vemula kii saansthanik hatya ke doshiyon ko sazaa dilaane kaa sangharsh, yaa dadri or oona main hue atyaachaar ke viruddh virodh pradarshan, har maukey par aap sabhi logon kaa jo sahyog mila uske liye shukriya
 We also fought for justice for Jisha and Delta and against the conspiracies to demolish Ambedkar Bhavan
 campus main librari main behatar suvidhaon ke liye bhi sangharsh kiya or balaatkaari chaatr ko sajaa dilwane ke liye bhi
 Thank you to all those who voted me and qualified for this position
 tahe dil se un logon kaa bhi shukriya adaa karnaa chahta hum jinhone mujhe vot nahin diya or shaayad ve meri raajnneetik vichaardhaara se puri tarah sahamat bhi nahin the, lekin jo meri bolne kii aazaadee ke samarthan main bahut badi sankhya main sadakon par utre
 i know that he took to the streets not for Kanhaiya Kumar but for his elected student union president
 shukriya un sabhi shikshakon kaa jo tamaam mushkilon kaa saamana karte hue jeenyu chaatrasangh ke saath khadey rahe, jinhone kaha ki 'kanhaiya jab police remand se adaalat main aayega to vahaan use sabase pehle apane samarthan main khadey shikshakon ke chehre dikhenge' or sangharsh ke har mode par unhone har tarah kii madad is andolan main kii
 My thanks also to all the employees who participated in this struggle
 shukriya un sabhi logon kaa jinhone mere samarthan main lekh or fasebuk post likhe or jinke liye naa jane kitni gaaliyaan unhen mujhe deshadrohi samajhane vaale or sanghee maansikta vaale logon se khaani padi
 Who has never been behind in arguing logically with my family, friends and other citizens of the country in favor of constitutional rights of me and other colleagues
 aap hai to loktantr he
 i am also thankful to my colleagues who reached Azadi Chowk every day in large numbers to open a front against the injustice of the administration
 jeenyu kaa paksh logon ke saamne rakhane ke liye kii gai desh ke vibhinn hisson kii yatraaon main jin logon ne hausala badhaayaa unka bhi shukriya
 i realize that i have not been able to fulfill my many promises made to you before the election, but i have made every effort to fulfill my responsibilities in such an unprecedented attack on JNU and in the current political situation
 
 mujhe yaad aata he ki jail se lautakar aane ke baad aapako sambodhit karte hue jab maine pehla shabd kaha - 'saathiyon' or jis utsaah ke saath aap sabane meraa hausala badhaayaa, yah utsaah or samarthan hi puure sangharsh ke dauraan meri urja bana rahaa
 The way the government and neoliberal forces are attacking the education system all over the country, the way atrocities on the deprived sections of society, Dalits, women, backward, tribals and minorities have increased, i hope that the newly elected union Will not let the torch of struggle against you extinguish
 campus main chaatro kii samasyaon ko dur karne ke liye kii gai koshishon ko aage le jaaya jayega or behatar suvidhaon or chaatravrutti ke liye sangharsh ko jari rakhaa jayega
 i will always stand in favor of the democratic thinking of JNU
 rohit act ko lagu karne kii ladaai ho yaa campus loktantr ko majboot karne ke liye lingadoh siforeeshon ke viruddh sangharsh, samaaj main vanchit logo ke haq ko sunishchit karne kii ladaai ho yaa sampradayik fasivadi takaton ke viruddh or shram kii lut ke khilaaf aawaaj buland karne ke prayaas, sabko shiksha, sabko kaam sunishchit karne ke liye or samaaj main samanta va nyaay sthapit karne ke sangharsh ke har morche par aap mujhe apane saath paaenge, yah meraa vaada he
 Kanhaiya Kumar JNU Students' Union President (2015-16) bihar main jediu or argedy ke bich vishwaas kii door kamjor padati ja rahi he
 If there is a split in the Grand Alliance in Bihar, it will affect not only the politics of Bihar, but also the politics of the country
 kyonki bihar main jis tarah se mahagathbandhan ne vidhansabha chunaav main kamyaabi hasil kii, isse duusare rajyon ke kshetreey dalon main josh bharaa
 Especially after the bitter defeat of SP and BSP in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, a question was raised that if the SP and BSP were together in UP on the lines of Bihar, the picture of the election result would have been different
 yahi nahin, bhavishya main ye donon partiyaan bijepi se mukaable ke liye saath aane par bhi andarkhaane taiyaar thi, jiskaa sanket khud akhilesh yadav ne diya tha
 Behind it, fear of the BJP or politics, attempts to preserve the existence
 ab bada sawaal ye he ki agar bihar main nitish kumaar or lalu yadav alag-alag raah par chalate hai to phir donon ke liye aage ke raste aasaan honge? yaa phir yah faisla donon ke astitv ko khatre main daal degaa? jediu-argedy kii is ladaai main gathbandhan kaa tootna nitish ke liye zyada nuksaandeh sabit ho saktaa he
 1
 agar nitish kumaar mahagathbandhan se alag hote hai to unke saamne vikalp ke taur par bijepi he
 Nitish will remain in power with the support of BJP
 lekin kya wo'modi yug'main bijepi ke saath hokar apane faislon ko bihar main lagu kar paaenge
 Because in recent days in the states where the BJP was a partner with the regional parties in power, the regional parties have weakened
 aise main nitish ke saamne bijepi ke saath gathbandhan chalaane ke alaava apni raajnneetik jameen ko bhi barkaraar rakhana ek chunauti hogi
 2
 lalu yadav ke saath banane rahane main nitish kumaar ko ek phayda to jarur he
 Because of the way Lalu Yadav has been surrounded in many cases of scams, the path of his personal active politics is not easy
 aise main nitish hameshaa argedy ke saath gathbandhan main front foot par rahenge, or isse lalu ko bhi shaayad koi aapatti nahin he or nahin hogi
 Not only this, it has also been shown in the last two years that Lalu Yadav never questioned Nitish's decisions
 3
 The way the government of the Grand Alliance led by Nitish Kumar has fixed a two-year journey in Bihar without any controversy, it has also increased Nitish Kumar's stature outside Bihar
 duusare gaiyr-bijepi shasit rajyon main nitish-lalu gathbandhan kii tarah kshetreey partiyaan ek manch par aane kii soch rahi thi, aise main nitish kaa alag hone kaa faisla duusare rajyon menmahagathbandhanaki neenv padane se pehle khatm ho jaaegi
 This will have an impact especially in Uttar Pradesh
 4
 Apart from regional parties, Congress is also looking towards Nitish with hope, because after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the way the Congress is getting weaker day by day, Nitish's political grip may be strengthened even outside Bihar
 
 yahi nahin, agar bijepi or narendra modi ke mukaable main khulkar nitish saamne aate hai to unhen tamaam kshetreey dalon ke saath-saath congress kaa bhi saath mil saktaa he
 5
 bihar main bhale hi aregedi ke 80 vidhayak hai, lekin lalu yadav aakhri vakt tak mahagathbandhan ko bachaane kii koshish karenge
 However, he is currently denying the agreement on Tejashwi's resignation
 lekin unhen pataa he ki agar nitish gathbandhan se alag hote hai to argedy kaa raajnneetik astitv par sawaal khadey ho saktaa he
 But it is also true that the way the JDU-RJD separated from the BJP 2 years ago, the strength of the BJP had increased, and along with Lalu, Nitish's political future was also getting hit
 aise main nitish kaa lalu se alag hona ek bada or khataron se bharaa faisla ho saktaa he

 mahilaon kii suraksha ko lekar jab se kanoon sakht hua he, tab se rape kii juthi shikayaton ke maamle bhi badhane lage
 In such a situation, Delhi High Court has said that women who have filed false cases will be punished severely
 adishnal seshan jaj virendra bhatta ke saamne jab dilli ke 2 yuva ladakon par lagaaya gaya jhootha gang rape kaa maamla aayaa, to unhone court staff ko nirdesh die ki juthi mahila kii shikaayat kaa maamla chif metropolitian magistrate ke saamne laayaa jaae
 The court said, 'due to humanity and kindness, we punish rapists strictly
 lekin aajkal mahilaayein iskaa galat phayda bhi uthaane lagi hai
 The court will now have to take responsibility on its own and support those who are falsely accused
 jis insaan par rape kaa aarope hota he uski garima or pratishtha waapas laana kaaphi mushkil he
 But even if the allegation is false, it is not impossible
 'jis cese ke baad hai court ne ye sakhti dikhaai he, us cese main mahila ne dwarka south police stesan main 2 yuvakon par gang rape kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 According to his statement, the boys first drank by adding vodka to a cold drink
 par baad main wo apane bayanon se mukarti or kahaniyaan banaati najar ai
 He later confessed that he had lied
 agle hi din usne dwarka south police stesan ke esechao ko chitthee likhi ki uske saath koi chhedchhad nahin hui thi
 Rather, she was drunk after drinking too much alcohol, so when the two boys refused to drop her home, she falsely accused them of teaching her a lesson

 It has struck him that where his high command resides, he has no existence
 pichley chunaav main aath siten jeetne vaali is party ke ab zyada se zyada teen siten jeetne kaa anumaan he
 So what does it mean - 1
 congress samarthakon ne bhi maan liya he ki agar bijepi ko koi roak saktaa he to vah congress nahin balki aam aadmi party he
 In such a situation, his traditional vote also went in favor of AAP
 2
 Sonia and Rahul are now reduced to zero
 prachaar ke dauraan unhone puraane kaamon kii duhai di, lekin unki naakaamiyon kaa aisa asar najar aayaa ki congress ke liye samarthan or kam ho gaya
 Sonia and Rahul have stopped asking for votes in their names
 3
 Ajay Maken, close to the Gandhi family, was given the leadership of Delhi elections this time
 lekin apni saaf chhavi ke baavjood ve kuch nahin kar paae
 The anger against the Sheela government is no longer there, but the votes in favor of the Congress are further reduced
 pichley chunaav main congress ko 25 pratishat vot mili the, is baar sirf 15 fisadi vot milane ke asaar hai
 4
 votaron kaa congress ke prati najariya aisa ho gaya, jaisaa use ek bhi vot diya to vah vyarth chalaa jayega
 According to the exit poll of Chanakya, the Congress is not getting a single seat
 agar yah sach he to kisi rashtriya party ko janata kii ore se dhul main mila dene kii yah sabase badi misaal hogi
 5
 aakhir main or sabase ahm
 Congress spokespersons have been the biggest winner after consecutive defeats
 lekin ab unhone bhi khud ko is maahaul main dhaal liya he
 Now they are not even talking about the Congress
 sirf AAP or bijepi kii aalochana kar rahe hai, jaisaa ki wo donon ek-duusare kii karte hai
 6
 agsit pole ke nateezon ko maanane ke liye na to AAP taiyaar he or na hi bijepi
 Both are talking about getting more seats
 sirf congress hi he, jiske netaaon ko shunya siten die jane par bhi aitraaj nahin he
 It is as if they are assuming that the party has matured

 Describing Anna Hazare's decision to campaign against the Congress in the Hisar Lok Sabha by-election as unfortunate, the Congress said that the government is committed to a strong and effective Lokpal and that the Gandhian leader should not have any preconceived notion on the issue
 congress pravaktaa raashid alvi ne kaha ki ek taraf anna yah kah rahe hai ki agar sheetakaaleen satr main lokapal vidheyak paarit nahin hoga, to vah congress ke khilaaf prachaar karenge, lekin ab vah sheetakaaleen satr tak intjaar nahin karnaa chaahate
 This is unfortunate
 unhone kaha ki har naagarik ko kisi kaa virodh yaa kisi kaa samarthan karne kaa sanvaidhanik adhikaar he
 
 
 Despite this, such a statement from Anna Hazare is regrettable
 congress ke media vibhaag ke prabharee janardan dvivedi ne is mudde par pratikriya vyakt karte hue kaha ki hajaare ko lokapal ke mudde par raashtra ke samuhik vivek par bharosa rakhana chahie, jiskaa pratinidhitiv sansad karti he
 He said that whenever Lokpal comes it will be a strong and effective one
 is mudde par pehle se koi dharna tay kar lenaa sahi nahin hoga
 Dwivedi claimed that we believed him when Anna said that he had no political ambitions
 nek iraade se unhone jo mudde uthaae hai, unka raajnneetik kaarnon se durupyog nahin hone dena chahie
 In Ralegan Siddhi, Maharashtra, Anna Hazare today warned on the Lokpal issue that if the Center fails to pass his form of anti-corruption bill in the winter session of Parliament, he will campaign against the Congress in those states where elections are held Are going hajaare ne kaha ki apane is abhiyaan kii shuruyaat karte hue vah haryana ke hisar loksabhaa nirvachan kshetra main matadaataaon se apil karenge ki ve congress pratyaashee ko vot nahin den, kyonki party jaanboojhkar vidheyak nahin laa rahi he

 SP state spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said that the Samajwadi Party will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections on its own
 choudhary ne kaha ki sapa kisi bhi raajnneetik dal ke saath chunaav purv gathbandhan nahin karegi
 He said, 'we sincerely hope that SP will not only become the largest party in Uttar Pradesh but will win more than double the seats in the last Lok Sabha elections
 'isse pehle, sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav ne shanivaar ko rajdhani sthit party mukhyalay main kaaryakartaaon se jamini str tak kaam karne kaa aahvaan karte hue kaha tha, 'aap logon ne agar mehnat kar di to sapa ko aagaamee loksabhaa chunaav main haalia vidhansabha chunaav jaisi jeet milegi

 After a day of dramatic developments in the politics of Karnataka, the media in-charge of Congress Randeep Singh Surjewala claimed that Yeddyurappa would prove to be the Chief Minister for just one day as he claimed to form the government in the name of supporting only 104 mlas in front of the Governor
 Whereas he would need 112 mlas to get a majority and run the government

 surajevaala ne maang rakhi ki agar ekal badi party ko pehle bulaanaa he to goa, bihar or meghalaya main bhi ekal badi party ko sarkaar banane ke liye bulaanaa chahie tha
 In these states too, other parties should have been invited to form the government
 inako bahumat sabit karne ke liye kahana chahie tha

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the upcoming Election Special News Letter bhartiya rigerv bank (RBI) ne atm graahakon ko badi raahat di he
 RBI has been issuing circulars to banks that failed transactions are a major problem during the use of atms and banks should not count it as a free transaction
 darasal graahakon kii shikaayat rahati he ki bank fail tranjaction ko bhi free tranjaction gin lete hai, isse graahakon ko har maheene milane vaale 5 free tranjaction main katautee ho jaati he
 Till now, the bank also considered the fail transaction as free transaction and reduced it to 5 free transactions received in a month, leaving 1 free opportunity for the customer
 ab RBI ne bainkon ko aadesh diya he ki atm par hone vaale fail tranjaction yaa balance jaanch yaa checkbuk applai jaise non-cash tranjaction ko graahakon ko har maheene milane vaale 5 tranjaction main ginati na kare
 Explain, as per RBI rules, ATM customer does not have to pay a fee for 5 transactions every month, but above that means the bank charges on the sixth transaction
 RBI ne yah bhi spasht kiya ki non-cash tranjaction jaise balance check, fund transfar ko bhi ATM tranjaction nahin mana jaae, yani arabiai ke is kadam ATM graahakon ko badi raahat milane vaali he
 Often people used to complain that despite the failure of the bank, the bank counted the free transaction, and for this reason, the bank charges the money for withdrawing money from the ATM

 This is also because India never stops - it goes on continuously
 iske vishaal vistaar or mayavi shanti ke neeche insaaniyat kaa chatpataata sagar hiloren martha rahata he
 Its raging waves can sometimes be helplessly and bring a high tide of prosperity and prosperity, at times it can be horribly merciless and can also bring ruin and troubles

 Such a personality which dominated our hearts and minds and such news

 In 2017, there is no shortage of newsmakers, whether they inspire us or disappoint us
 yah nai shuruyaaton kaa saal tha, to puraane khaatmon kaa saal bhi tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was our 2016 newsmaker, continued to make tall strides in the political world even this year and has shown very high stature from his compatriots
 yahaan tak ki jab notebandi ke baad ke jatke samoochee arthvyavastha main mahasoos kiye ja rahe the, modi ne aazaadee ke baad ke sabase bade kar sudhaar, yani maal or seva kar, ko puri takat se desh ke maththe madh diya
 In all the occasions and reasons he relied on to get Parliament passed quickly and convert it into law, he was Arun Jaitley, Union Finance Minister

 Businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, were burdened with tons of paperwork and stuck in the slag of many slabs
 aise slab jo kuch vastuon ke maamle main to behuudagi kii hadon ko paar kar gaye the
 Meanwhile, the double whammy of demonetisation and GST hurt the growth of the economy and GDP fell in the fifth quarter in a row, then it recovered slightly at the end of the year

 Leaving aside some of the cravings of saffron-colored government buildings, Yogi took a worldly path to rule his kingdom and displayed his inclination towards hard work and socializing

 These states also included Gujarat, where the Prime Minister did not hesitate to fall below the limit to conquer his home state

 duniya ke falak par modi kii tarah ek or awwal rashtravaadi netaa ne apni shreshthata jataai—chini raashtrapati shi jinping
 He attacked the high level of corruption within the country and adopted a strong and expansionary foreign policy (remember Doklam) outside the country, which aims to shift the world's center of gravity from the US to China

 More than anything else, Virat has transformed the Indian cricket team and made it into an ultra-fit, war machine cast in its own mold
 unhone yah khilne kii apni pakki dhun or lagan se hamen vaah-vaah karne ko majaboor kiya, apane stroke play se mantrmugdh kar diya or apane is yakeen se ki jeet se kam kisi cheez kaa koi matlab nahin he, hamen un par naaj karne kaa mauka diya
 In 2017, Virat emerged as the emperor of modern cricket and the new lord of millions of passionate people of India

 Former US Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Vickery has said that if the United States bans Iran for oil and Russian missile system S-400 deal on India, then the US will suffer the most
 india today ko die exclusive intervyuu main remand ne bharat-america ke vyapaarik rishton se lekar trump ke bharat daure tak par kai sawaalon ke jawaab die
 On the indo-us business relationship, Raymond said that India and America are the two great democracies of the world, who should be strong allies
 haalanki iske liye aarthik judaav behad jaruri he
 But unfortunately, US President Donald Trump seems unwilling to encourage it
 unhone kaha ki aap ek taraf majboot sahyog kii baat karen or thik usee samay bharat ke nazariye se mahatvapurn iran ke tel par pratibandh or rus se raksha saude ko prabhavit karne vaali chijen karen, ye saath nahin chal saktaa
 Raymond said that you cannot argue that you are imposing tariffs to protect your steel industry and then imposing restrictions on other countries
 unhone kaha ki saubhaahgya se donon ore bahut saare log hai jo ise or aage badhate dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Pointing to Trump, he said that i hope that there will be no tweet in this case at the last minute which messes everything up
 america pratibandh se bharat ko chhot pararemund ne kaha ki hamane america sansad main lambey vakt tak kadi mehnat ke saath kaam kiya he
 The US Parliament has many leading senators like Dan Sullivan
 tim ken, mark warner jaise seenetters hai jo america hiton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue bharat ko chhot dilaane main samarth hai
 In such a situation, the most important question is what the President decides about the S-400 missile system, because he was unhappy with it
 remand ne kaha ki mujhe lagata he ki bharat ko chhot mil sakati he
 To think that India will break its ties with all countries to please America is beyond reality
 roosi missile system S-400 par chhot nahin mili to?remand ne kaha ki agar bharat ko america ne S-400 deal par chhot nahin do to yah bada jhatka hoga
 He said that the imposition of sanctions completely on India would prove extremely harmful for the US
 haalanki unhone ummid jataai ki aisa kuch nahin hoga or antim samiksha ke baad bharat ko chhot mil jaaegi
 Chabahar port Parremund said that energy is an important point in the india-us relationship
 remand ne kaha ki aaj america hydro-carbon, petroleum or natural gas ke utpaadan ke maamle main duniya main number ek hai
 So there is more business potential in India for America
 isliye agar america manamaani karata he ki isse use nuksaan hi hoga
 At Chabahar port in Afghanistan, Raymond said that Pakistan was unnecessarily stuck in it
 paris samjhaute parparis samjhaute se america ke alag hone par remand ne kaha ki chahen kerala kii baadh ho yaa california main aag yaa phir texas main baadh, ye sabhi prakritik nahin hai
 All these disasters are man-made
 jalwaayu parivartan puri duniya ke saamne ek bada sankat he, jiskaa ham sabhi saamana kar rahe hai
 Unfortunately, the US has distanced itself from the deal
 H1B visa mudde parakeh1b visa mudde par unhone kaha ki kanoon or agxcutive disijan main antar hota he
 Any changes to the H1B visa require US Congressional approval
 america ko bharat se aane vaali pratibhaaon kii jarurat he
 He said that there are many disadvantages right now, which need to be considered
 unhone is maamle main behad satark rahane kii baat kahi
 On Trump's visit to India on the occasion of Republic Day, Raymond said that it depends to a large extent on the approval of the US Congress
 trump bharat daure par bhale hi khud faisla kar sakate hai, lekin agar ve congress ke khilaaf jate hai to unke liye raajnneetik samasya ho sakati he
 Raymond said that if Trump goes to India he will be very happy
 america se adhik roosi hathiyaaron parabharat main ganatantr diwas kii parade main america se adhik rus ke hathiyaaron kii pradarshnee hogi
 In such a situation, whether the Trump administration is hesitating to approve the tour to India for this reason, Raymond said that this is definitely a big problem
 kyonki parade main america se adhik rus ke hathiyaaron kii pradarshnee dekhakar trump kya mahasoos karenge, is bare main to kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa, lekin ye bhi sachai he ki pichley kuch saalon main america or bharat mendifence deal16 arab dollar tak pahunch chuki he

 After the Balakot Airstrike, if Pakistan would have made any major snowfall, then the Indian Army was fully prepared for a long battle even in that situation

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he) China has given a stern warning to the US regarding the North Korea issue
 chini media ne kaha ki america uttar korea se jang jeetne kaa sapana na dekhe
 It will be very difficult for him to win over North Korea
 china ke sarkari akhbaar global times ne apane sampadakeey main likhaa ki america raashtrapati donald trump ne uttar korea ko tabah karne kii dhamkee di, jiske baad uttar korea ne bhi uske guan sthit sainya thikaane par missile daagne kii ded line ghoshit kar di he
 It is believed that North Korea will attack Takguan in the middle of August
 darasal, haal hi main korian prayadweep par america bamavarshak B-1B udata hua dikhaa tha, jisane guan sthit anderson airforce base se udaan bhari thi
 The Global Times said that since North Korea conducted its nuclear test for the first time in 2006, its verbal war with the US has continued
 uttar korea america kii har dhamkee par palatwaar kar rahaa he
 Not only this, it has also developed better nuclear and missile technology during this period
 ise bhi padhieh north korea ke log bole- aadesh mili ham US par atom bam banakar girengexni akhbaar ne kaha ki uttar korea ko america halke main lene kii koshish na kare
 Today it is a nuclear capable nation
 agar yuddh hua, to america ko khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 Earlier, the US also tried its best to isolate North Korea on the global stage
 uttar korea ke najadik jangi bede bheje, lekin inkaa us par koi asar nahin padaa
 North Korea continued to conduct nuclear and missile tests, ignoring all warnings from the United States and the United Nations
 uttar korea par pratibandh lagaakar america ne badi galati kii
 It acted like putting ghee in the fire
 chini akhbaar ne kaha ki america ko uttar korea se kisi bhi tarah ke takaraav se bachanaa chahie
 Because in the event of war, along with North Korea, America will also have to suffer heavy losses

 At night a few thousand feet above sea level, i see the glow of the cities of India
 saat lakh gaanvon ke is desh main kareeb ek-tihaai aabaadi ab kareeb 8,000 shaharon or kasbon main rahati he
 At the grassroots level, listeners have started getting stories to hear different kinds of stories in cities and towns of India
 kuch kahaniyaan alag dikhaai padati hai
 Our traffic jams, drinking water and sanitation issues, our homeless and intrepid citizens struggling to get public services, dreams of a better future in the city and the struggle to reach it, a day of difficulty
 shahari niti kii baarikiyaan rosemara main dikhaai nahin deteen, lekin behad ahm hai
 Constantly expensive land tightens the screws on the chances of getting a house within a lower price
 shahari sthaneey nikaayon ko shashakt bananaa ab bhi dur kii kaudi he
 We have not imagined what our cities can take — living systems of living, where economies run on their own, centers of manufacturing and services, ground for sprouting new ideas, places where people get opportunities To come in search of
 andhadhundh hode kii is bhartiya kahani main hamaare shahar chauraahey par khadey hai
 Prospects and aspirations are clashing with the idea of the city as a havan kund of insurmountable challenges
 asli bharat gaanvon main basane ke tamaam kisse kahaniyon ke baavjood bharat ke anek rashtriya netaaon ke safar kii shuruyaat shahari maahaul main hui he
 In 1947, villages were dominated in independent India
 shaharon ke bare main gandhi kii sankalpana bhi aupniveshik anubhav kii dein thi
 The colonial city with its natives and cantonment areas separated the ruler from the governed
 nehru ne ateet se katkar aadhunik bhartiya shahar kaa ekadam alag sapana gande kii koshish kii or iske liye rajyon kii nai rajdhaniyaan banaain
 In Ambedkar's view, villages were places of exploitation for marginalized people and that was an alternative vision
 shahar kii kalpana aaj bhi raajnneeti se nirvasit he, haalanki rajyon kii rajdhaniyaan, aarthik centre, mahangi jameen-jaaydaad, rajnatik or naukarshahi kaa centre, sab shaharon main he
 Local self-government was left behind in the two-tier federal system
 isamen shaharikaran ko 'samasya’ or gaanv se shaharon kii taraf palaayan ko gaanvon ke vikaas kii asafalataa kaa pratik mana jaataa tha
 The story of urban institutions is that despite the 74th amendment to the local bodies in 1993, the functioning of urban development is slowing down because they have very little resources, power and political scope
 gaanv or shahar ke bich khai kii pratikatmak jaden bhi vot main chhipi hai, jahaan shaharon ke nagarikon ko banta hua rajnatik gut mana jaataa he, jisamen gaanvon kii jati, dharm or pahchaan par aadhaarit gutbandi jaisi rajnatik saudebaaji kii samuhik shakti kaa abhaav hota he
 It is another matter that the principle of metropolitan urban India is today confronted by various factions pushing for the benefits of narrow identities, which are bent on wiring the concept of the Constitution
 shahari raajnneeti kii nai dishasatvin yojana se shahari samaaj kii soch niti main ghuspaith karne lagi, jisase desh kii aarthik chadar main kuch salawatein padane lageen
 The 74th Amendment of the Constitution was such a turning point, where it became necessary to consider the basic elements of constitutional administration from the neighborhood to the metropolitan level for the feeling of decentralization
 prashasnic sudhaar ayog ne vikendrikaran kii vakaalat kii
 Similarly, in 2011, the Empowered Expert Committee tried to loosen the triple clutches of money, activities and office bearers
 13wein vitt ayog ne aavanton main jabardast vruddhi kii sifarish kii or maal tathaa seva kar (jiesti) kaa prastaav rakhaa taaki shahari swashaasan ko zyada paisa mil sake
 The Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) is perhaps the largest mission-based initiative for cities in the world, incorporating financial incentives in urban development
 is mishan ke duusare prastaavit charan main or zyada shaharon ko shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 The need for improvement in urban infrastructure has started to be recognized as the first condition for investment and economic growth
 shahari peedi kaa udaiphir bhi badi baari kamiyaan maujuud hai
 If the cities of India are to be saved from getting entangled in the vortex of deep crisis, then a new concept of cities is not only economic but also a political necessity
 adhiktar rajnatik dal or samooh is sambhaavna par vichaar karne lage hai
 For one, the right cities have come to be regarded as political vote banks of late
 shahari kendron main haal main hue dharne-pradarshnon ne sabit kar diya ki shaharon ke rajnatik swar ab mukhar hone lage hai
 This will tell the future whether it was indeed a decisive moment for the urban Indian generation after 1991
 hamaare yahaan neuyork, bunus yrs, tokyo or landan jaise agxcutive powers vaale chune hue pratinidhi nahin hai jo apane shaharon ke kaamkaaj or kaary style main badlaav laa saken
 Despite the delimitation of constituencies, the current Lok Sabha member count is not in proportion to the growing urban population, yet the change will come slowly but surely
 ab yah sawaal lagaataar puche ja rahe hai ki bharat ke shaharon main aazaadee or garima kaa matlab kya he or kiske liye he
 This question has to be answered
 duusare, 'gramin-shahari’ paaramparik dharna ko badalte dehaat, bade gaanvon ke vikaas, shaharon ke chaaron taraf failte daayre or janaganana kasbon (sensos touns) kii sankhya main teji se chunauti mil rahi he
 The gathering in cities is increasing, yet a large part of India will remain in the villages
 sansadhano kii kami, jameen kii anuplabdhta, pani, bijli or paristhitiki kii simaaon tathaa technology se judi unnati ko dekhte hue ham vikendrit gramin-shahari ekajutata kii nai sambhaavnaaon kii kalpana kar sakate hai
 This will require a welfare state that can better associate itself with rural and urban desires
 tisare, hamaare shaharon ko visheshkar garibon, bacchon, laachaaron, mahilaon, vridhon or kai tarah ke viklang logon ke liye sevaaon main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 Low cost housing and healthcare, water for all, sanitation and solid waste disposal system, better education, sustainable employment and opportunities to start enterprises, effective public transport system, equal market share opportunities, more active administration All these are necessary from both moral and political point of view
 hamen udhyamshiltaa ke aise nae rup gande honge jo utpaadakta, vetan or aajeevika kii suraksha main bijli kii gati se badhotaree kar saken
 It may be that a new urban livelihood mission has to be created which can bring harmony between urban and rural rights
 haalanki china bhi abhi is bare main nahin soch paaya he
 India's preparations for the 2050s, the colonial idea of planning the city as a gigantic space neatly carved on the drawing board, is now the hallmark of the economic, social and political powers that have become the hallmark of India's cities
 Is not
 arthvyavastha jaise-jaise badhegi or 7-8 karod se adhik kii aabaadi vaale shahar viksit honge to unase ubhartee chunautiyaan paaramparik soch vaale toun plansrs ko pareshaan kar dengi, kyonki ye chunautiyaan akele nahin aaengi
 To deal with the truths of tomorrow, including human development and security, climate change and infectious diseases, we need to develop a political understanding of how people live in our cities
 The Manhattan grid, designed in 1811, has stood the test of power — automotive, central park, fiber optics, we need such urban structures designed for the future
 paanchvaan, shahari badlaav ko vistaar kii chunautiyon ke anuroop dhalanaa hoga
 Municipalities and other institutions have to be ready for this in less than two decades
 dashakon kii upeksha ko dur karne ke liye arabon kaa nivesh chahie
 The old laws have to be removed
 land market main bade paimaane par ai vikruti ko dur karnaa hoga or use shram bazaar, awajahi vyavastha, awaas, bijli or duusari janasevaon se kargar dhang se jodpha hoga
 There is another problem that has been overlooked
 vah samasya aise sahi logon ko jutaney kii he jo bharat ke shaharikaran ko uske apane sandarbhon main samajhen or uttar america yaa purvi asia kii nakal katai na karen
 Only those who have an overall understanding of various fields can solve the problems of tomorrow: economics, planning, law, sustainability, design, technology, structure and history of society, etc
 in profeshnal logon ko prashikshit karne ke liye rashtriya str par sabase unnat str kii vibhinn vishyon se judi sansthaaon kii jarurat he
 The Indian Institute for Human Settlements may take the form of a similar university to handle this mission
 aise dilachasp daur main rajnatik uthal-puthal to hokar rahegi
 Democracy challenges those in power to rethink the possibilities at the right time
 yuva netaa jaanate hai ki 2050 kaa bharat aaj ke bharat se ekadam alag najar aayega
 The challenge of understanding the reality of India's various urban truths, past and present, is a little difficult but exciting is also not less
 vyakti vishesh se, sthaneey str se or dainik jindagi se sampark khoe bina rashtriya str par lagaataar vruddhi kii jarurat ko kaise puraa kiya jaae, khaas taur par yahi bhartiya chunauti he

 Stay healthy & blessed always
 shatrughna sinha (shatrughan Sinha) ne is twit ke jariye is baat kaa khulaasa bhi kiya he ki rekha (rekha) ne unki home production ke saath kaam bhi kiya he or apana janmdin unki patni ke saath share karti hai
 Users' reactions to this tweet by Shatrughan Sinha have also started coming
 in dinon filmon se dur rahane ke baavjood rekha ne logon ke dilon main apni jagah banaai hui he
 Born on October 10, 1954, Rekha saw many ups and downs during her film career
 kariyar ke alaava unki jindagi main bhi kai mode aae, lekin aaj bhi rekha ne majbootee se apni pahchaan banaai hui he
 No one can guess his age by looking at his style

 She was a child artist in that film

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election rally for Lok Sabha elections has started
 guuruuvaar ko piem modi ne uttarakhand ke rudrapur main raily ko sambodhit kiya
 During this, he said that your watchman's government has shown the courage of surgical strike, be it land, sky or space
 piem narendra modi ne kaha ki ek taraf nae bharat ke sanskaar hai or duusari taraf vanshavaad or bhrashtachar kaa vistaar he
 Today, on the one hand, there is a solid basis for development, on the other side there is neither policy, idea nor intention
 ek taraf faisle lene vaali sarkaar he, duusari taraf dashakon tak faisle taalane vaala itihaas he
 During the Rudrapur rally, PM Narendra Modi said that the Congress kept the ex-servicemen in deception for years
 van rank van pension ko latakaae rakhaa
 He had kept a budget of only 500 crores in the name of One Rank One Pension
 hamaari sarkaar ne van rank van pension ko manjuuri di or 35,000 karod rupee sainikon tak pahunchaa die
 PM Narendra Modi said that Congress' Ragdarbari says that Modi should not talk about air strikes, Modi should not raise the issue of security of the country
 kya modi chupchaap baith jaae? kya aatankiyon kii dhamkee se modi dar jaae? darane vaale sanskaar aapke is chaukeedaar main nahin hai
 Will the people of the country forgive those who make anti-india statements in their desire to become the heroes of Pakistan? PM Narendra Modi said that Uttarakhand is like a beautiful definition of India
 yahaan ganga he, yamuna he
 The confluence of the confluence with Bhagirathi is the Alaknanda, the Panchakedar and if badri-kedar are mixed, four dhams are formed
 main inamen paanchvaan dham jodta hum - sainik dham
 i want to ask the people of Sainik Dham
 sargical strike ke baad hamaare vir javaanon kii veerta par sawaal uthaanaa kya sahi tha? jab aatankiyon ko ghar main ghuskar maaraa gaya to vir javaanon par aise sawaal karnaa sahi, kya senadhyaksh ko jhootha kahana sahi tha?piem narendra modi ne kaha ki 4 peedi pehle garibi hataane kaa jo vaada congress ne kiya tha, vahi aaj bhi doharaa rahe hai
 This is the biggest proof of Congress's lies, thinking and its failure
 70 saal tak garibon se gaddari karne vaali congress kabhi garibon ke bare main nahin soch sakati
 That is why the poor of the country are also saying that to remove poverty it is necessary to remove the Congress
 congress hi garibi kaa kaaran he
 Prior to the rally in Rudrapur, PM Narendra Modi addressed the rally in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh

 The illegal liquor business in Uttarakhand's capital Dehradun is so flourishing nowadays that cases of illegal liquor are being reported from many places everyday
 ab dehradun ke haridwar bypass par avaidh sharaab kii factory kaa police ne bhandaphod kiya he
 Surprisingly, this liquor business was going on for a long time just two kilometers from the Nehru Colony police station
 dehradun main avaidh sharaab kii factory ke is maamle main police ne khulaasa karte hue maukey se chaar logon ko bhi giraftaar kiya he, jabaki ek anya faraar hone main safal rahaa
 Along with this, the material used for making liquor has also been captured by the police
 rajdhani ke thana nehru colony kshetra ke nilayaa hills ke saamne ek workshop main avaidh sharaab kaa gorakhdhandha chal rahaa tha
 In the room above this workshop, a fake factory for making wine was running
 jisamen thana nehru nagar police, thana raneepokhari police or esaoji kii sanyukt team ne dabish dekar sharaab banane ke upkaran kabje main le liye
 Police said that these smugglers were making fake country liquor and English liquor and supplying it in the surrounding area for several days
 jisaki soochna milane ke baad maukey par police ne chhapemari kii
 During this raid, liquor smugglers named Bulandshahar residents Sanjay, Yatendra, Rahul and Ravindra have been arrested from the spot
 vahiin godaam kii talaashi lene par maukey se desi ore angreji sharaab banane ke upkaran bhi baraamad kiye gaye hai
 Police said 65 illicit liquor of Jaffran, about 400 liters of spirit alcohol, 29 bottles of empty bottles, lid dispenser, a bundle of Jaffran lid bags, 4 Imperial Blue wrapper bags, 20 Bisleri bottles, police said
 , Two bottles of flavor, an alchometer, typing machine, bundles of tape and 2 packets of hall mark have been recovered
 police kii maane to sanjay or rabindra paal pehle haryana se sharaab taskari karke dehradun main bechaa karte the, lekin munafa adhik na hone ke kaaran in donon ne sharaab banane kii yojana banaai
 Yatendra and Ravindra Pal together started the work of making spurious liquor in Dehradun itself
 ravindra paal spirit alcohol kii vyavastha haryana se dehradun supplai karke laata tha
 Sanjay got printed from liquor labels Hall Marks and Sticker Shamli and brought them to Dehradun, with the four making huge profits by selling fake liquor
 saath hi chaaron milakar yahaan par sharaab banaakar alag-alag gadiyon se supplai karte the
 Information is being collected regarding the people who were being smuggled through the four accused
 vahiin isse pehle bhi dehradun main avaidh sharaab ke maamle saamne aate rahe hai
 Recently, more than 100 people lost their lives in Uttarakhand after drinking poisonous liquor
 uske baad prashasan ne puure pradesh main tabadatod chhapemari kar kai sharaab ke thikaanon ko band karavaaya tha
 However, after such cases come to the fore again, questions are also raised on the intention of the government
 angreji ban gai he desh kii aam bhashaa- camel hasan'maatrubhaasha kii sthiti ke saath chhedchhad manjuur nahin'van nesan, van language kaa virodh thamata najar nahin aa rahaa he
 Now actor Kamal Haasan said that English has become a common language in the country, but it is a mere coincidence
 isse pehle actor rajnikant ne kisi bhi bhashaa ko thopane kaa virodh kiya tha
 He said that it is unfortunate to impose Hindi on the southern states
 makkal nidhi maiyyam ke pramukh camel hasan ne kaha ki angreji desh kii saamaanya bhashaa ban gai he
 He said that although this has happened in an informal manner, English has become the common language of the country
 camel hasan kaa ye bayaan abhinayta rajnikant ke us bayaan ke baad aayaa he jab unhone kaha ki desh ke vikaas ke liye ek saamaanya bhashaa kii jarurat he
 Rajinikanth also opposed efforts to impose Hindi language and said that no language should be imposed on the country, not only Hindi
 camel hasan ne kaha ki ve duusari bhashaaen bhi sikhte rahe hai
 But this is possible only as long as their mother tongue is not tampered with
 unhone kaha ki bhashaa ko lekar dusron kaa suzav sweekaar he, lekin yadi koi unki maatrubhaasha kii pojishan ke saath chhedchhad karata he to ve ise bardaasht nahin karenge
 On the proposal of Union Home Minister Amit Shah to make Hindi language the language of the country, Tamil actor and politician Kamal Haasan said on Monday that no 'shah, Sultan or Emperor' should break the promise of unity in diversity, Which was done at the time of making India a republic
 camel hasan ne kaha tha ki vividhta main ekta ek vaada he, jise hamane bharat ko ganraajya banane ke samay kiya tha
 Now no Shah, Sultan or Emperor should break that promise
 ham sabhi bhashaaon kaa sammaan karte hai, lekin hamaari maatrubhaasha hameshaa tamil rahegi

 There was resentment in Jhansi after the capture of Yogi, but after the arrest of nearly two thousand supporters including BJP MLA, the possibility of confrontation was averted
