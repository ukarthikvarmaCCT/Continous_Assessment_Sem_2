 police sutron ke anusaar, deepak bharadwaj or mahant pratimanand ke bich haryana main ek jameen ko lekar vivaad bataaya ja rahaa he, jiske chalate hi is hatya kii sajeesh rachi gai ho sakati he
 The question of who is the killer of billionaire leader Deepak Bhardwaj remains a puzzle
 har din ek nayaa naam saamne aata he
 After a dozen names, the new name has now emerged
 ab ek mahant pratimanand kaa naam liya ja rahaa he
 According to police sources, Mahant Pratimanand had given Rs 2 crore betel nut to Purushottam and the reason behind it was the land on which Mahant and Deepak Bhardwaj had a dispute
 video:sabase amir netaa deepak bharadwaj kii hatyapulice ke sutron kii maane to supaari milane ke baad purushottam ne saathiyon ke saath milakar deepak bharadwaj kii hatya kar di
 It is being told that Mahant Pratimanand has ashrams in Haridwar and Mathura
 baavjood is jaankaree ke, mahant pratimanand police kii pakad se baahar he
 Mahanta's accused Purushottam is being told to give betel nut by Mahant
 uske yahaan purushottam ne kisi jamaane main driver kaa kaam kiya tha
 When the police investigated Purushottam's bank account, an amount of Rs 6 lakh was found in it

 aropiyon se poochtacha main jo jaankaree mili he, use dekhte hue police maan rahi he ki shooters purushottam or sunil donon hi supaari kiling main bich kii kadi ho sakate hai
 The shooters must have met the murder contract not directly from the mastermind of the plot, but from someone else

 The war of words in Haryana and Punjab is still going on in the stubble burning incident, but the process of burning stubble by flouting the law is not over
 pichley hafte tak dilli haaf rahi thi
 The level of hazardous particles in toxic air reached a record level of three years
 supreme court kii manaahi ke bawoojad dhan ke khet ko saaf karne ke liye paraali jalaane kaa kaam jari he
 India Today's data team DIU tried to find out which state and which area is at the forefront of burning the straw by mapping these incidents across the country
 28 oktober se lekar 4 november ke dauraan assi fisadi yani 8,974 paraali jalaane kii ghatnaayen akele punjab main huin
 Parliyana and Jharkhand are second in the case of stubble burning
 haalanki satellite keval jalane kii ghatana ko record karata he, chaahe wo jangal kii aag ho yaa phir paraali kii
 After all, who is burning the Parali in Punjab? Data collected from the satellite shows that in Punjab some areas especially Sangrur, Ferozepur and Bathinda have more incidents of burning of Straw
 agar ham punjab main pichley dinon paraali jalaane vaale top ten ilaake par najar daalen, to sangrur main kisaanon ke paraali jalaane kii 1300 se zyada ghatnaayen saamne ain
 The number 1,174 incidents of stubble burning were reported in Ferozepur
 kya vaaki haryana main kam paraali jalaai gai?dhan kii kataai pakane par hoti he, jo sidhe taur par taapmaana par nirbhar hoti he
 This time the crop was ready in Haryana faster than Punjab
 lihaaja kisaanon ne kheton main aag lagaakar paraali pehle hi jala di
 Farmers in Punjab have been harvesting paddy of late
 yahi vajah he ki haryana main paraali jalaane kii ghatnaayen punjab jaisi nahin dikh rahi hai
 The farmers of Haryana who are burning the straw are more than those in the northern part of Punjab
 pichley ek hafte ke bheetar haryana ke fatehabad ilaake main paraali jalaane kii 200 ghatnaayen ghatit hui hai, jabaki kaithal or sirsa jaise ilaake main paraali jalaane kii kramash: 91 or 57 ghatnaayen samaane ai hai
 Why Jharkhand at number three? During the last one week, a total of 324 active fire points have been seen in Jharkhand, most of which are from areas like Kolbhool Dhanbad, Bokaro and Singhbhum, where coal mines are also frequently under fire
 uttar pradesh main zyaadaatar pichley hafte ke dauraan mathura main sabase zyada aag kii ghatnaayen samaane ai hai
 Although it also includes frequent flames emanating from the petrol refinery, Muzaffarnagar in western Uttar Pradesh and Shravasti district of the Middle East have witnessed five and six stubble burning incidents respectively
 puure desh ke pichley nau saal kaa itihaas dekhen, to takreeban har saal ek lakh se zyada aag kii ghatnaayen hoti hai, jinamein se zyaadaatar paraali jalaane se judi hui hai
 The season of paddy or wheat is different everywhere
 isliye paraali jalaane kii ghatana bhi ek saath ghatit nahin hoti hai
 The problem with Punjab's Parali is that paddy is beginning to be harvested at a time when the cold is high and Delhi is gasping with poisonous air
 4 november tak ke aankade bataate hai ki ek hafte main deshbhar main kul 10 hajaar 271 aag kii ghatnaayen satellite kii najar main ain
 About 84 percent of the total number of stubble burning is in Punjab alone
 philhal fasal chakra or dhan kii kataai kii miyaad ko dekhte hue saaf he ki paraali jalaane kaa silsilaa agle do hafte tak jari rah saktaa he
 Due to this, people in NCR including Delhi may have to struggle with pollution

 Yes, one such case has come up in Bhilai area of chhattisgarh

 After selling the stolen motor bike, all the boys used to share the money received equally

 From where adult accused have been sent to jail and minors to Child Correctional Home
 durg adishnal espi shashimohan singh ke mutabik aaropee naaballig ladakon ke paas se 12bike or ek car baramadki gai he
 All the minor boys caught in Dhar are masters in the case of theft
 unke paas kai gadiyon kii master chaabi he
 These boys also break the electronic lock very easily
 inke paas alag-alag motor bikon ke lock todane ke upkaran bhi hai
 According to him, all the boys have their Android mobiles, on which they used to watch youtube
 iske baad yojana banaate or use anjaam tak pahunchaate the
 Actually, after seeing the amount of thousands with the minor boys, a person had informed the police
 soochna main bataaya gaya tha ki saadhaaran parivaar ke ye ladke hotalon main roj party kiya karte hai
 At this party, we drink hookah and wine
 police ne in ladakon kii gatividhiyon par najar rakhi
 His record was also scrutinized through teachers in schools
 tab jaakar pataa chalaa ki saare ladke madhyam vargeey parivaar se hai or unhen jeb kharch ke liye bhi ghar waalon se koi rakam nahin di jaati

 According to the police, these boys have shelled more than a hundred motor bikes in a year

 jetali nekolkata main indian chembar of commers ke ek sammelan main kaha, 'hamaari raajnneetik pranali kii paripakvata kii pariksha ho rahi he
 Not only the government, most regional parties are also supporting GST
 sirf ek raajnneetik party haalanki ise rokane ke liye sansad baadhit karne kaa tarika apana rahi he
 Otherwise there was general consensus about it
 'kanoon nahin ban saktaa vidheyak
 
 
 Jaitley said that the House of Lords is not elected in Britain, so even after its opposition, the House of Commerce can legislate by passing the Bill
 unhone kaha ki chunki bharat mensansad ke donon sadanon kesadasy chun kar aate hai, isliye sirf ek sadan main paarit hone se vidheyak kanoon nahin ban saktaa

 Design period: 4 years Qualification: 12th pass, English compulsory saamaajik kaaryakartasudha bharadwajki giraftaar ke baad bhilai sthit unke ghar par samarthakon kaa tantaa laga hua he
 He is in awe of the allegations against him
 saath hi is aarope ko sire se khaarij kiya ki sudhaa bharadwaj kaa naksaliyon se kabhi koi naata rahaa he
 They say that Bhardwaj has only raised his voice from the street to the court against the injustice done to the tribals and laborers
 naksaligatividhyon main unke shaamil hone kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Supporters of Sudha Bhardwaj have called her arrest a political conspiracy
 dilli se unki giraftaar ke baad chhattisgarh ke bhilai sthit unke ghar par samarthak jutane lage
 Sudha Bhardwaj was in the labor camp in Jamul area from 1992 to 2007
 unka yah ghar ab residence kam offis kii tarj par upyog hota he
 It was from this house that he started his first performance and social movement
 majdoor netaa shankar guha niyogi hatyakand ko lekar is ilaake main pradarshnon kii shuruyaat isi ghar se hui thi
 After this, he also started a movement for human rights abuses
 dhire-dhire unki chhavi adivaasiyon or mazdooron ke bich aisi bani ki wo unhen apana hamdard samajhane lage
 As soon as he got the news of Sudha Bhardwaj's arrest, these people gathered in his house
 bhilai ke jamul ilaaka sthit lebar camp kisi samaysudha bharadwajka janaa pahachaanaa thikaana hota tha
 Although even today they have to come and stay in this office, but much less than before
 saal bhar se wo dilli main rah rahi hai
 Due to the court proceedings, they often come and go from Delhi to Raipur and Bilaspur
 ab is daftar main unki maujuudagi behad kam darj hoti he, lekin unase jude sanghathan or sanghathan ke kaaryakrtta yahaan niyamit rup se aate rahete hai
 If there is a big case, Sudha Bhardwaj is approached through this office and then the road from court to court proceedings is paved
 yahaan maujuud koi bhi shaks yakeen nahin kar paa rahaa he ki sudhaa bharadwaj kaa koi naksali conection ho saktaa he
 They are calling it a political conspiracy
 bharadwaj ke samarthak rajkumaar sahu ke mutabik wo saal 1992 ke dashak se sudhaa bharadwaj se jude hai
 He claimed that Sudha Bhardwaj never had any contact with the Naxalites
 wo to adivaasiyon or mazdooron ke haq kii ladaai ladati rahi hai
 She was never involved in anti-national activities
 ek anya samarthak mangalabai ne bataaya ki wo ek factory main karyrat thi
 Labor laws were not followed here
 sudhaa bharadwaj ne kanoonon kaa paalan karavaaya
 This gave them employment
 daftar main maujuud dukhiram ne ek ghatana bataai ki aakhir wo kis tarah se udyogpatiyon or mil maalikon ke khilaaf kanoonee ladaai ladati rahi hai
 These supporters have demanded the release of Sudha Bhardwaj
 saath hi bharadwaj kii giraftaar ke virodh main unke sanghathan ne sadak par utarkar ladaai ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 With the arrest of Bhardwaj, his supporters are preparing for the movement with the entire party force
 mazdooron kii kanoonee ladaai ke liye shuru kar di thi vakalatsudha bharadwaj ne mazdooron ke andolanon ko hawa dene ke saath-saath adaalat kii ladaai bhi ladi
 For this, after the year 2007, she started advocating in the Bilaspur High Court
 bastar main maanavadhikaron ke hanan or adivaasiyon par hone vaale atyaachaar ko lekar unhone bilaspur hoicourt main kai yanchikaayen daayar kii
 Due to this, there is a lot of trouble in the chair of many government officials
 chhattisgarh mensudha bharadwajasamaajik or maanavadhikaarwaadiyon kii sabase badi hamdard ke rup main jaani pahachaani jaati hai
 Sudha Bhardwaj strongly raised the killings of the tribals, due to the Salwa Judum in Sukma, Bastar, in 2007, the Sudha Bhardwaj has been a problem for many government officials in the case of killing of tribals and burning their houses
 isamen police or prashasan ke afasar bhi shaamil hai
 More than a dozen bureaucrats in the state are under the Human Rights Commission's target because of the issues raised by them
 sukama ke bahucharchit kodaasavali main hue nirmam hatyakand maamle main police ne na to mritkon kaa postmortem karaayaa tha or na hi ajtak mritkon ke parijanon ko koi muaavja mil paaya he
 He had also filed a petition in the Chhattisgarh High Court regarding this matter
 'yachikaaon ke chalate sudhaa bharadwaj ko fansaane kii chal rahi sajeesh'adaalat ke nirdesh par is ghatana ko lekar pehla mukadmaa ghatana ke saat saal baad oktober 2013 main darj kiya gaya tha
 Due to the petitions filed by Sudha Bhardwaj in the court, legal proceedings against the officers directly or indirectly involved in the case are bound to happen
 haalanki ye tamaam yachikaayen abhi bilaspur hoicourt main vichaaradhin hai
 The final decision on these has not been done yet
 sudhaa bharadwaj ke kareebi maanate hai ki inhi yachikaaon ke chalate unhen naksali maamalon main fansaane kii sajeesh chal rahi he
 Imitation in examinations is common in Bihar
 bihar main metric yani 10veen kii pariksha main apane bacchon ko nakal karana maa-baap, bhai, chachaa, maamu sabakaa paariwarik daayitv hota he
 All remote relatives gather to conduct matriculation examination
 nakal karne ke nae-nae tareeke izaad kiye jate hai
 For every candidate, there is a master or some sharp student who solves the answer to the question
 usase pehle yah sunishchit kiya jaataa he koi ek candidet pariksha haul se prashnptr baahar phenk de phir baahar baithe log uskaa uttar taiyaar karte hai
 From his various tricks, answers are taken to the examination hall
 isamen skool kii building kii diwaar chadhana, chat par janaa, ventilator se parchaa phenkna, saath main yah bhi sunishchit karnaa ki parchaa aapke hi bachche ko mili
 All this is hard work and risky too
 sabase aasaan he vahaan tainaat police vaale ko paisa yaa ghoose dena or apane bachche kii pahchaan bataanaa
 Another easy way is to bribe the Master or extract a relationship with him even if he is far away
 yahaan bhi baat na bane phir apni jati kaa master sahab dhundhna
 It is not that only the parents or the nurturers get mimicry in which there are also boys who help the lovers and sisters
 vaise aapako bataa duun aisa puure bihar main nahin hota hajipur, navada, samastipur, chhapra, siwan, gopalganj jaisi jagah nakal karaane ke liye kukhyat hai
 Copying there is also important especially for girls because it is easy for matriculate girls to get married
 baat yaheen khatm nahin hoti pariksha ke baad jab copy jaanch ke liye jaati he to saare sambandhi yah pataa lagane main jute jate hai ki vah kis jile main kis skool ke kis master sahab ke paas ja rahi he
 Then the same lobbying process, here also the game of extracting relationships from money is repeated
 bihar ke shikshaamantri ne saaf kar diya ki keval sarkaar nakal ko nahin roak sakati isamen abhibhavakon kaa bhi sahyog chahie
 But the government will also have to accept that non-stop of copying is the result of the inferior and corrupt system of Bihar
 jahaan prashasan, police, teacher sabhi bike hue
 It is also a test of good governance in Bihar
 aakhir ye rukegaa kaise yah tabhi band hoga jab collejon main daakhile ke vakt test lene kii pratha shuru hogi yaa phir puure shiksha tantra ko durust karnaa hoga
 But where the entire structure of primary education is dependent on Matric pass education friends, who get only 4 thousand salary, how will the system change
 yah sochna sarkaar ke saath sthaneey prashasan ke saath ham sab kaa he
 In the end, i will say this much that let the Biharis fail, but do not put the foundation of theft at the time of the 10th exam
 yahi aage ja kar boj banenge aapke liye

 In the cricket world, ABCDE meant AB Devilliers Can Do Everything, but the manner in which the South African team was shattered in the final moments in the semi-final match, the tag of 'chokers' has been stuck a bit more

 The way AB de Villiers came on the toss showed that he was quite nervous
 shaayad toornament se pehle or iske dauraan unhone jo bade-bade bayaan die uskaa dabaav un par haaavee hone laga tha
 In the previous match, Kyle Abbott bowled brilliantly and played a key role in demolishing the Sri Lankan batting

 He is the same one-on-one fielder who was out of the last several matches due to a hamstring injury and his performance in this crucial match was very disappointing

 There is no doubt that a batsman like AB de Villiers is not in any format at this time, but the best player of any team is also excellent in captaincy

 ) Canadian Defense Minister Harjit Singh Sajjan will be visiting India in late April
 is dauraan vah amritsar bhi jaaenge
 Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has said that he has refused to meet the Canadian Defense Minister
 amarinder singh ne kaha ki harjit singh or unke pita khalistaan ke samarthak rahe hai, isliye unase mulaakaat karne kaa sawaal nahin uthta
 Sajjan will visit India on April 20, during a conversation with a channel, Amarinder said that in the government of Justin Trudeau of Canada, a total of 5 ministers, including Sajjan, are pro-khalistani, so they have no enthusiasm for his visit
 harjit singh sajjan 20 april ko bharat aayenge
 Amarinder Singh said that when i wanted to go to Canada last year, Khalistani supporters opposed my visit
 jiske kaaran main canada nahin ja paaya tha, main vahaan chunaav prachaar karne nahin balki apane punjabi bhaaiyon se milane ja rahaa tha
 Let us tell you that Amarinder was going to visit Canada last year due to the increasing influence of Aam Aadmi Party in Canada, but could not go due to protest
 tabhi se ve canada kii sarkaar se naaraaz hai
 Regarding Pakistani artists in support of Pakistani artists, Amarinder Singh said that he is not in favor of banning Pakistani artists
 unhone kaha ki ve pakistani kalakaaron ko punjab main bulaanaa chahenge, or khud bhi punjab jaaenge
 Now is the time to forget the enmity and befriend Pakistan

 The disaster in Uttarakhand has been completed for a year, but in one stroke, the government help in healing the wounds of those who were swept away is not only less, but no complete plan of disaster management has been prepared
 logon ke sir par na chat he, na rojgaar
 India Today took stock of the situation a year after the catastrophic disaster on 16-17 June 2013: The state-run ITI building in 9 foot land in the Srinagar area of the city of Chandigarh was reminded of that dreadful night of 16-17 June 2013, even today
 i create shuddering
 is itii se sate shakti vihaar ilaake ke makaanon ke bhu-tal man bhi itnaa hi malba-pani bhar gaya tha
 On the first night, people had saved their lives by climbing on the roofs, the next day the rescue team took them to a safe haven
 shridhar prasad ratudi ne baad main kuch sarkari to kuch apane prayaas se malba hataakar ghar ko phir rahane laayak banaaya tha
 But he says, "the administration had asked for a list of damages, but nothing
" malba hataane ke liye shuru main kuch majdoor jarur mili lekin baad main sab kuch khud hi karnaa padaa
 "the government has made a new institute with pre-fabricated technology next to ITI, but the people around have started their lives as before the accident, irrespective of the river stream
" srinagar se rudraprayag kii ore aage badhen to raste main dhari devi mandir main shraddhalu puja ke liye jate dikhte hai
 This is the same temple that the administration raised through Pillar on 14 June 2013, and Hindu leaders like bjp's Uma Bharti have called the disaster an outbreak of the goddess's anger by removing the idol
 usase upar kedarnath se kareeb 75 kilometre pehle naulapani main mandakini nadi kaa kahar ab bhi maujuud he
 On the night of the accident, Mandakini took a road of about half a kilometer
 ab bagal main pahaad kaa seenaa chirakar nai sadak bana di gai he
 The national highway going to Kedarnath was closed here
 ise puri tarah durust karne ke liye majdoor aaj bhi mashiinon ke saath jute hue hai
 Looking ahead to the Mandakini flowing near Tilwara tomorrow, it is difficult to guess that this river had destroyed the hotels, houses, roads built on its banks a year ago
 nadi kii dhara dayee ore kareeb 30 meter tak khisak chuki he
 Local people say that some people got compensation, but whose livelihood was related to hotel business, they have not received anything yet
 (aapadaa ke baad pehali baar ho rahe chardhaam yatra main yatriyon kii kami se khaali baithe ghode-khachchar vaale majdoor)halaat patari par jindagi bepatarisarkari prayaason se itnaa jarur hua he ki halaat dhire-dhire saamaanya hone lage hai
 The biggest challenge of the administration was to identify the affected families and provide relief to them
 rudraprayag ke dm dow
 Says Raghav Langar, "the work was challenging, but there was not much problem in identifying the people, because those whose houses were swept away are building a new house with the help of government and World Bank nearby
" ” lekin sarkaar abhi tak aisi prakritik aapadaa se bachane yaa nuksaan kam karne kii koi dirghakaalik yojana nahin bana pai he
 At present, improvised arrangements have been made to bring life back on track
 (kedarnath yatra ke maarg par tilwara ke paas sumadi ke kshatigrast makaan aaj bhi tabaahi ke manjar kii yaad dilaate hai)inhen kaamchalaoo, oobad-khabad or dhul udaati hui sadakon se aage badhen to agastya muni vikaas khand kaa silli ilaaka he jahaan puri sadak bah gai thi
 Ramesh Benzwal, 43, who lives here, had his house, shop and goshala washed away in the swollen river
 nadi yahaan 20 foot upar aa gai
 How to overcome such a huge loss, Benzwal explains, “the government has given Rs 2 lakh to build a house
 die hai or vishwa bank ke 5 lakh ru
 The first installment of Rs 1
5 lakh
 mili hai
 The remaining installments will be found after the engineer report
 ” haalanki rajya aapadaa prabandhan vibhaag kii ore se india today ko mili raahat kaaryon kii suchi main kaha gaya he ki vishwa bank se pehali-duusari kist do-do lakh ru
 The third installment of Rs 1 lakh
 kii hogi
 It hurts Benzwal that the administration has not made any compensation for the loss of goods and cattle
 makaan ke liye jitani raashi di gai, vah naakaafi he
 That is why people have to complete their unfinished house by taking loans
 bandwal bataate hai ki sarkaar sirf ek makaan ke liye muaavja de rahi he jabaki yatra maarg par vyavsaay ke lihaaj se logon ne kai makaan or dukaane banavaai thim jo bah gayi
 Government relief is insufficient to heal the wounds of the people
 paryaton chaupat ho gaya he
 Millions of people are unemployed
 jin logon ne hotel or vyavsaay aadi ke liye bank se karj liya tha, use chukaane kii majaburi he
 People are sending their children to relatives' homes in the plains to study
 nadi par pakke pul nahin hai, pagarhndia tuuti hui hai
 The National Highway has been repaired but is not fit to withstand a major disaster
 (agastya muni ke sili ward se aage ban rahaa neshnal haai-ve jahaan se ek vakt ek hi vaahan guzar saktaa he
 Damaged Inter College can ever be the cause of an accident
 Regardless of the unhappy administration, unhappy victims of the disaster and negligence of the administration, most of the people of this village situated between Kund and Guptkashi are still living in temporary shelters
 mandakini ke kinare based semi gaanv ke nichle hisse main alaknanda nadi bah rahi he
 After the disaster, houses started sinking in this village
 45 parivaar vaale is gaanv main aadhe se zyada makaan july tak dhans gaye the or baaki ko asurakshit ghoshit kar diya gaya tha
 Social worker Anusaiya Prasad says, "the state government had declared Chandrapuri and Semi village unsafe but the rehabilitation has not been done till date
 majabuuran log phir se jameen dhansane vaale ilaake main hi makaan bana rahe hai
 Kunwari Devi, the former head of the village, says, "the government is neither working itself nor allowing ngos
" kerala se mata amritanandmayi kii sanstha or uttarayani jaise sanghathan ghar banane ke liye taiyaar baithe hai lekin prashasan se manjuuri nahin milane kii vajah se kaam shuru nahin ho paaya he
 "(ITI of Srinagar which has been buried in 9-10 feet of debris) (now a new building made of pre-fabricated technology) passes through the river in Uttarkashi as soon as the area of alaknanda reaches Uttarkashi via a winding hill path
 The panoramic view of the city from the road draws towards the valley
 lekin ghati main pahunchate hi 16-17 june, 2013 kii raat kii vinashlila sahasaa ankhon ke saamne ghoomane lagati he
 The hammock pool and main road connecting the city on the banks of Bhagirathi has been demolished
 tilot or joshivada ke bich aaj bhi nadi ke bichobich se hokar guzarana padataa he
 Shankar Nautiyal, who is running a shop near the Tilot Jhula bridge, says, “relief work started in March this year while the disaster came in June last year
 ”nadi ab mitti ko katkar rasta na badal sake, iske liye kinare par kancreet kii diwaar khadi kii ja rahi he
 Nearby is the Maneri Dam, where the Bhagirathi is tied
 iske aage deedsari gaanv he jisaki chunaavon ke dauraan khub charchaa hui
 In the disaster, the bridge of Didsari and the surrounding three villages was broken
 gaanvvaalon ne shramdan karke ek asthaayee pul banaaya
 He is also washed away
 sarkaar ne in gaanvon ko mukhya sadak se jodgaye ke liye abhi koi upaay nahin kiya he
 The house of Shantilal, 57, of Deedsari was also buried in Bhagirathi's lap that night
 ve kehete hai, “sarkaar kii ore se makaan banane ke liye pehle do lakh ru
 And later Rs 1
5 lakh
 or mili
 But where does a house get built in this amount? ” shantilal ko usase bhi zyada dukh shramdan se banaae gaye pul ke tuutane se he
 He says, “the administration had promised to build the bridge
 lekin hamen abhi tak surakshit rasta nahin mila
 Children bother to go to school
 agar raat main gaanv main koi biimaar pad jaae to 4 kilometre atirikt rasta tay kar hi mukhya maarg par pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 "(the disaster in Karnprayag was devastated and the bridge could not be built even after a year)
 Many villages that were lost from the map, not only the bridge, cattle, hotels, schools but many villages like Rambada are also no longer there due to disaster
 Does not exist yahi haal chamoli jile kii joshimath tehsil main badrinaath neshnal hive par govindghat kasbe se kuch duuri par sthit bhudar or pulana gaanv kaa bhi he
 On June 17 last year, the flood in the Pushpavati river, originating from the Valley of Flowers, took away the Bhudar, which was lying on its banks
 din ke ujaale main ai baadh se 102 parivaar vaale is gaanv main maanav kshati to kam hui lekin makaan, goshaala, skool, mandir, raste sabhi bah gaye
 Where previously there was a village, now the river flows
 gaanv kii pahchaan mahaj upree hisse main ek sarkari dhaanche ke toote hue hisse se hoti he
 Pulna, situated five kilometers below this village, was also the victim of Pushpavati's havoc
 in donon gaanvon ke nivasee ek hi the jo jaadon ke 6-8 maah pulana main to baaki samay bhudar main rahete the
 The route to the world famous Flower Valley National Park and Hemkund Sahib pass through this village
 lekin ab pulana ek tapu main to bhudar nadi ke galiyare main tabdeel ho chuke hai
 Yet 9 out of 102 families have started building houses with government help
 pulana nivasee or joshimath jila panchayat ke purv sadsy bhavan singh chouhan kehete hai, “log purv siem vijay bahuguna or maujuuda siem harish ravat ke saamne guhaar laga chuke hai
 Rawat had given assurance of rehabilitation in Kanjila Tok near Bhyudar village, but the matter hangs in the balance due to neglect of local administration
 isliye log govindghat se joshimath tak ek saal se besahaara gum rahe hai
 “pilgrimage was the means of livelihood of Bharat Singh Chauhan of Pulna
 lekin makaan ke saath khuwada pul par bana unka restaraan bhi bah gaya
 He says, "most of Bhudar's businessmen had lodges, restaurants here
 lekin adhikariyon ke aage-peeche chakkar kaatane ke baad bhi koi muaavja yaa restaraan ke liye surakshit jagah nahin mili
 ”however, as per the rent from the administration, three thousand rupees per family
 jarur mil rahe hai
 (in Karnprayag, the house being built by stealing the eye from the devastation and then encroaching the river), the eyes of the passengers are very lonely, it is the effect of that catastrophic disaster that the hands which never got a minute's time away from work, this time Char Dham Even after a month of the beginning of the journey, they are sitting hand in hand
 halaat aise hai ki pichley saal tak in dinon hajaaron tirthayatriyon se thase rahane vaale govindghat kasbe main lagbhag sau yatriyon ke pahunchane ko badi ghatana mana ja rahaa he
 Businessman Asu Singh Rawat, who supplies ration on this route, says, "the real impact of the disaster is happening now
" pehle ke mukaable 10 fisadi bhi kaam nahin he
 The lodges are empty and far from earning, it is becoming difficult to extract the money put in the business
 ” aasu singh ne loj main rakhe karmchaaree bhi hataa die hai
 Horses, mules and laborers who are waiting for the pilgrimage from Gaurikund to Kedarnath on foot are having to wait several days for the ride
 khan-paan se lekar mazdooree se jindagi basar karne vaale chehre sahame hue hai
 Jagdish Bahadur who came to Jankichatti to visit Yamunotri after sitting in Kandi, returned in ten days
 maayoos jagadish bataata he, “kamai to dur kii baat, khaane ke laale pad gaye isliye waapas laut aayaa hum
 The disaster has had a tremendous impact on pilgrimage
 aapadaa se pehle 2012 main badrinaath jane vaale yatriyon kii sankhya 10,60,000 thi to kedarnath jane vaale yatriyon kii sankhya 5,75,000 thi
 Before the disaster last year till June 10, the number of people going to Badrinath was close to 4,30,000 and the number of people going to Kedarnath was about one and a half lakh
 lekin is saal yatriyon main baari giravat darj kii gai he
 According to the data, the number of people going to Badrinath has so far reached 74,000, while Kedarnath has reached only 20,782 passengers
 gangotri, yamunotri or hemkund sahib jane vaale yatriyon kii sankhya lakhon main hua karti thi lekin is saal gangotri main 33,000 to yamunotri main 23,000 ke kareeb yatri hi pahunche hai
 Yes, the number of visitors to Hemkund Sahib is close to 1,17,000, which is much less than the 4 lakh passengers last year
 (ramesh bandwal, agastyamuni ilaake ke sili ward main ve jahaan khadey hai vahaan unka hotel teesri manzil par tha
 a nearby bridge was swept away and now people pull trolleys with the help of rope) Deepening the disaster, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand, Harish Rawat told India Today, “80 per cent of the families have been given homes
 punarvaas ke liye praathamikta ke aadhaar par teen saal kii kaaryayojna taiyaar kii gai he, jisamen centre sarkaar ne 7,981 karod ru

 Khanduri says, “the three important yatra routes Badrinath, Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib have suffered greatly
 centre ne khaas madad nahin kii or rajya ne bhi laaparvaahee barti
 People are angry
 ”rajyastareey aapadaa, punarnirmaan evam kriyanvayan samiti ke adhyaksh tathaa badrinaath ke vidhayak rajendra singh bhandari kehete hai, “aapadaa raahat or punarvaas ke liye record shasnadesh nikle or niyamon ko saral banaaya gaya
 "but Leader of the Opposition Ajay Bhatt says," The government has not yet made a blue print of disaster management
 rajya ke 337 gaanvon ke punarvaas kii koi vyavastha nahin he
 People are still living in tents

 aisi ghatnaon ko rokane ke liye suraksha bal sthaneey logon ke sampark main hai taaki samay se pehle aise maamalon ko roka ja sake or logon main suraksha kaa bhav paidaa kiya ja sake
 Information about terrorists is also being obtained from local people

 The terrorists are targeting not just apple orchards but also government buildings and setting them on fire in the presence of people
 shopiyaan jile ke ek gaanv main 28 agast ko aatankiyon ne ek panchayat bhawan main aag laga di thi
 Villagers say that some local youths have joined extremist organizations and are carrying out such incidents
 or yahi vajah he ki log unke khilaaf kuch bhi bolne ko taiyaar nahin hai

 Melinda, 42, did not lose courage and decided to take the matter into her own hands
 natijatan unhen badi kamyaabi mili
 Putting a post on Facebook, she wrote, 'I am appealing to women who have been raped by a black man in Swindon area
 main rape ke ek maamle main madad kii darkaar he
 'two stranger women approached Melinda after seeing her post and said that she was also raped
 unhone aapas main jaankaree saajha kii or pataa chalaa ki un sabhi kaa rape ek hi shaks ne kiya he
 His statements gave the police evidence and now 53-year-old Orville Waughn was yet to be arrested

 Waughn followed her as she was going to meet Simon
 tab vah apane 20wein baras main tha
 Melinda recalls, "she found me quite creepy, but i agreed when she said i should talk to her
" main tab se lekar aaj tak khud ko is baat ke liye kos rahi hum, lekin mujhe yahi bataaya gaya tha ki bade jo kehete hai vah karnaa chahie
 'waughn then led them to the parking lot, where he raped her
 melinda ke mutabik, 'maine chillane kii koshish kii, lekin aawaaj baahar nahin gai
 i tried to push him, but he was 6 feet
 main phir chillane kii koshish karne lagi, lekin usne mujhe ghunsa maar diya
 i was crying, there was nothing i could do and i was in pain
 main chaahati thi koi aakar mujhe bachaa le
 But i also wanted nobody to see me
 main apamaanit mahasoos kar rahi thi
 'after this Melinda reached out to Simon crying
 unhone kaha, 'vah mujhase kah rahaa tha ki mujhe ise bare main apane gharavaalon ko bataa dena chahie, lekin mujhe laga ki ve meraa vishwaas nahin karenge
 i did not even go to the doctor
 'melinda is vaardaat se kaaphi saham gayi
 Many times she did not even go to school
 is bich syman ke saath unka rishta bhi badal gaya
 He said, 'I was afraid that he would see me the other way
 ' pehle to ve donon sirf haath pakadte the, lekin rape ke do maheenon baad ve hambistar ho gaye
 Melinda says, "I did not want to associate rape with sex and i thought i would be able to overcome it
" syman acha tha, main usase pyaar karti thi, main use mahasoos karnaa chaahati thi
 i was the only one
 'saal 1986 main disambar ke maheene main 15 saal kii melinda pregnent ho gayi
 She felt that after being a child she would be able to get out of this shock
 unhone kaha, 'mere parivaar vaale kaaphi niraash the, lekin unhone mujhe syman kii tarah sahyog diya
 'finally in 1987, Melinda told her mother everything
 unke pita police ke paas janaa chaahate the, lekin melinda ne manaa kar diya
 Melinda gave birth to another son in 1987
 iske baad 1989 tak syman ke saath unka rishta chalaa
 He said, "the rape incident between me and Simon has always been a hindrance
 main hameshaa pidaa main rahati thi, main zyada acchhee nahin thi
 'when his second son was four months old, Simon left him and left
 iske baad to jaise melinda tut hi gai
 Then he met Greg, whom he told about his tragedy
 baad main donon ne shaadi kar lee
 In April 2010, Melinda started working in a local super market
 kuch maheenon baad unhone vahaan waghan ko dekha
 She was so nervous to see him that the staff started crying in the room
 tab unhen ehsaas hua ki ab wo or chup nahin rah sakati
 After this he complained to the police
 lekin kuch hafton baad unhen bataaya gaya ki unke paas waghan ke khilaaf paryaapt saboot nahin hai
 Melinda did not give up and in April 2011 she posted a request on Facebook
 unke doston ne ise apni wal par share kiya
 Two days later, two women, Sara and Aimee, approached him and told him that he was also raped
 iske baad melinda ne local chif consteble ko ek patr likhaa
 Waughn was arrested four weeks later
 wo kahati hai, 'jaise hi police ne mujhe bataaya ki wo giraftaar ho gaya he, meri ankhon se aansu chhalak aae
 Eventually, it was possible after so many years

 The Supreme Court has rejected Yakub's curative petition on Tuesday, he will be hanged on July 30
 jabaki memon ke parivaar ne maharashtra ke rajyapal ke paas faansee par roak ke liye dayaa yachika di he
 Significantly, about 22 years ago, on March 12, 1993, serial blasts were carried out in Mumbai, in which 257 people were killed and 700 were injured

 In the police station too, the police was so helpless in front of the hooliganism of the Bhagwa Bhagwa Brigade that when they brought the girl and boys to the police station, there was a lot of uproar by the members of the Hindu Yuva Vahini
 yahaan tak ki pulisavaalon ko bhi dhamkaaya

 shanivaar 11 june se shuru ho rahaa he europe kaa sabase bada footbal toornament 'euro cap 2016'
 As such, there is so much reason to watch this tournament that the best 24 teams of Europe are playing in it
 lekin iske alaava bhi paanch aisi vajahen hai jinke liye aapako euro cap 2016 dekhnaa hi chahie
 Now you must be wondering what is it that we are asking you to watch this tournament
 to janaab khud hi pard lijie wo paanch kaaran jinke chalate aapako ye toornament dekhnaa hi chahie
 1
 lijends ke liye european champion banane kaa aakhri maukaagar aap footbal follow karte hai to aapako pataa hi hoga ki is khel main italy ke 38 varshiya golkeeper jiyanluigi bafan kaa kya ohada he
 Apart from these, you will not be aware of the importance of French defender Patrick Evera, 34-year-old Czech goalkeeper Peter Czech playing for Arsenal, and 35-year-old Thomas Rosicki, who has retired from club football
 world champion germany ke bastian shwanstiger or lukaal podolski kii umr bhi 31 saal ho chuki he
 Apart from these, Italy's Daniele di Rosi has also turned 32 years old
 31 saal ke ho chuke portugal ke christiano ronaldo ke liye bhi aglaa euro cap khelnaa mushkil hi he
 Famous Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has also seen 34 years of spring
 spanish golkeeper ikar casius 35 saal ke ho chuke hai or is team ke duusare goli david di gia kii skills dekhte hue agar wo chahenge to bhi agle euro cap ke liye team main jagah nahin bana paaenge
 His fellow player Andres Iniesta, defender Juanfran are also difficult to play until the next Euro Cup
 aise main koun sa khilaadi apane aakhri euro cap main vijeta banakar lautega ye jaanane ke liye aapako euro cap dekhnaa hi padegaa
 2
 yuvaaon kaa josh dilaa paaegaa kamyabisenior players ke saath hi kai yuva khilaadi bhi hai jo apane-apane klbon ke saath behtareen khel dikhaakar acha naam kama chuke hai
 In such a situation, how will these games show against European giants at international level
 aise khilaadiyon main belgium ke kevin di bruene, eden hajard, spain ke sesar apilecuyta, hectares belarin or alvaro morata
 Renato Sanchez of Portugal, Stephen L
 Sharave of Italy
 germany ke paul pogba, kingsle koman, antony grijaman or austria ke david alaaba shaamil hai
 3
 spain laga paaegaa euro cap kii hetricalgaataar do baar euro cap 2008, 2012 apane naam kar chuke spain ke paas euro kii hetric lagane vaali pehali team banane kaa mauka he
 It will be fun to see if the Spanish team will be able to hit the Euro hat-trick by winning the Euro Cup this time
 agar manager vinset del boskyuu kii team ye karnama kar paati he to itihaas bananaa tay he
 The Spanish team also has good goalkeepers, midfielders and defenders to carry out this task
 spanish team main achche forwards kii kami jarur he lekin wo bina striker ke bhi international level par acha khel chuke hai isliye unase ummid he ki alvaro morata, nolitho or aritj adurij ke dam par 'la Furia Roja' euro apane naam kar lenge
 4
 kya germany doharaa paaegaa, spain kaa karishmaye sawaal lagbhag har footbal premi ke dimag main he
 Let me tell you that Spain won the 2012 Euro Cup after winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup
 jiske saath hi spain world cap or euro cap donon ek saath apane paas rakhane vaali teesri team ban gai thi
 The current world champion Germany will try its best to repeat this feat of Spain
 haalanki unki bhi midfield or golkiping main to kaaphi dam he lekin strikers ke maamle main german, turkish lig main khilne vaale mario gomage, parttime striker thomas mular or zyaadaatar vakt winger khilne vaale lucas podolski par nirbhar hai
 5
 koun sa striker karegaa sabase zyada golfootbal ke match main gol naa hon to majaa thodaa kam ho jaataa he
 In such a situation, everyone wants to know who will be the striker who will score the golden goal in his name
 is maamle main english team sabase majboot najar aa rahi he
 He has strong strikers like epl's Golden Boot Winner Harry Kane, second-placed Jamie Vardy, Wayne Rooney, Danielle Sterridge and epl's new sensation Marcus Rashford
 antony grijaman, anthony marshall or oliver girode vaali france bhi strikers ke maamle main damdaar dikh rahi he
 Apart from all this, there is another striker who has all eyes on him, and that is Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic
 inke alaava belgium ke romelu lukaku, chrischian bentek or portugali winger christiano ronaldo par bhi sabaki nigahen hongi
 It is to be seen that any Spanish player who has been winning the golden boot of this tournament for two consecutive times will win this time too or else one of these veterans will become the emperor of the goals filmkaar sanjay gupta apni film 'mumbai saaga' kii shooting shuru karne ko lekar, utsahit, baichaiyn or nervas ho gaye

 Ganga is a symbolic

 Then there used to be circus in Sabarmati, or children used to run there, now the situation is different there

 ham is chaal ko kaamyaab nahin hone denge or nitish kumaar sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon ko mukhya mudda banaae rakhenge
 At an election rally in Bihar on Thursday, Rahul had questioned the secular credibility of the JDU and said that on the one hand it is maintaining a relationship with the BJP and on the other side it is claiming that it is against 'divisive' politics
 bhaajapa netaaon kaa maananaa he ki rahul ne sochi samajhi ranneeti ke tahat pehle charan ke chunaav kshetron ke vaaton ko sampradayik aadhaar par baantne ke iraade se is tarah kaa bayaan diya he

 bhaajapa adhyaksh nitin gadakari ne bhi bihar main rahul ke asar ko mithyaa bataate hue kaha he ki rahul karishma jaisi koi cheez nahin he or chunavi nattejey is baat ko sabit kar denge

 This is a direct violation of law
 ardblue ke logon kii shikaayat thi ki is tarah ke aayojan se na sirf dhwani pradooshan hota he
 Rather, due to the dirt in the park, common people are unable to use it
 bataa den ki kuch vakt pehle isko lekar engiti or supreme court bhi isi tarah ke aadesh de chukaa tha
 Therefore, after this petition came to the Delhi High Court, the Delhi High Court had stayed stay of organizing Ramlila in the disputed park saying that DDA will not allow Ramlila to be held
 agast main aae is aadesh ko ramlila cameti ne dilli hoicourt kii dabl bench main chunauti di
 Advocate Sanjeev Nassiar, appearing on behalf of the Ramlila Committee, argued that it is a 35-year-old Ramlila

 As the ongoing discussion about the lack of toilets in the country, six newlyweds in Uttar Pradesh's Kushinagar left their in-laws in protest against the lack of toilets at home

 sthaneey saamaajik kaaryakarta aashaa parveen ke mutabik baghawat karne vaali in mahilaon main neelam, kalavati, sakina, niranjan, gudiya or sita shaamil hai
 Seeing the example of such collective courage in the same village of the country, the founder of Sulabh International, Bindeshwar Pathak has announced to build toilets in the laws of all these six women
 pathak ne in vivaahitaaon ke vidroh ko bahut sahaspurn tathaa asaadhaaran qaraar dete hue kaha ‘is tarah kii ghatnaon kii badhati sankhya spasht rup se darshaati he ki ghar main shauchalayon kii jarurat ko lekar mahilaon kii soch main badlaav aa rahaa he
 Now everyone is understanding the importance of toilets
 ’ unhone kaha ki sulabh international in mahilaon ko unke saahas ke liye sammanit karegaa
 Earlier Priyanka Bharti of Maharajganj district was honored for rebelling against not having toilets in her in-laws
 pathak ne kaha ki khaskar gramin ilaakon main ghar main shauchalay nahin hone se mahilaon ko kaaphi dikkaton kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 They have to wait for the toilet to go dark
 yah vidmbana hi he ki desh main shauchalayon se zyada mobile phone hai
 He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for raising the issue of toilets prominently in the speech given by Red Fort on the occasion of Independence Day
 pathak ne kaha ki desh ke itihaas main pehali baar kisi pradhanmantri ne swadhinata diwas par lalakile kii pracheer se diye gayi bhaashan main shauchalayon ke mudde ko uthaaya he
 i am confident that now the acute shortage of toilets in the country will be overcome and the dignity of women will be protected

 urvashi rotela pichley kaaphi samay se industry main hai or ve aksar apni khubsuurati ko lekar charchaa main rahati hai
 However, she has not yet done a challenging role in any film and neither has she been a part of any blockbuster film

 Significantly, just like Pagalpanti, Anil Kapoor was also present in Total Dhamaal
 iske alaava paagalpanti main jon abraham, kriti kharbanda, saurabh shukla, eliana decruige jaise sitare bhi maujuud hai
 There is no film of Urvashi so far, a part of 100 crores club - If this film hits at the box office and collects more than 100 crores, then it will prove to be the first 100 crores film of Urvashi's career
 urvashiki samakaleen nusrat barucha ab tak do 100 karod club vaali filmon kaa hissaa rah chuki hai
 His film Sonu Ke Titu's Sweety and Dream Girl did more than 100 crore business
 haalankiurvashine abhi tak aisi kisi film main kaam nahin kiya he jisane 100 karod se adhik kaa bijness kiya ho
 In such a situation, this film can start a good day for them

 The Law Ministry has lodged a protest against a provision in the Lokpal Bill that empowers the Lokpal to file a charge sheet against a government official without the prior permission of the competent authority
 mantralay ne ise ‘sangrakshan ke siddhant’ ke viruddh bataaya
 The ministry said before the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha studying the Lokpal Bill, "in the event of the proposal of prosecution by the Lokpal, the provision to remove the need for prior permission will be against the principle of protection required by government servants
 mantralay ne kaha ki sarkari adhikariyon ko samvidhan ke anuchhed 311 or 320 or khand 3 (si) ke tahat praapt sanvaidhanik sangrakshan par prastaavit kanoon ke praavdhaanon kaa pratikul asar padegaa
 As per Chapter 7, Section 23 (1) of the Lokpal Bill, 'ombudsman for investigation or preliminary inquiry on the directions of the Lokpal or for filing a closure report or charge sheet for completion of inquiry in this regard before a special court under this Act
 Shall not require the approval or approval of any officer
 ’kanoon mantralay ne pradhanmantri karyaalay ke adhikariyon ke liye suraksha maanak muhaiyaa karaane ke lihaaj se bhi vidheyak main ek praavdhaan main sanshodhan kii vakaalat kii he taaki lokapal ke adhikari rashtriya suraksha or parmaanu urja jaise samvedansheel muddon par poochtacha nahin kar saken
 The ministry told the committee that the draft of the bill needs to be amended to protect the PMO officials from questioning
 jab poocha gaya ki kya rashtriya suraksha, parmaanu urja or saarvajanik vyavastha jaise muddon par maujuuda vidheyak main pradhanmantri ko diye gayi sangrakshan ke daayre main adhikari bhi aate hai to mantralay ke adhikariyon ne kaha, ‘yah vyaktigat taur par pradhanmantri par lagu hota he
 When some members of the committee asked where the Prime Minister could not be questioned by the Lokpal on the issue of national security but whether his personal secretary could be called to give information, the officials of the ministry said that in such a scenario There is a need to change the provision
 mantralay ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki praavdhaan main samuchit tareeke se badlaav hona chahie
 He called for some changes in the draft
 unhone is baat par bhi rajamandi jataai ki samvedansheel muddon ko sanbhaalane vaale logon ko chhot milani chahie

 darasal, aagaamee 2 april se rigerv bank of india ke maudrik niti samiti (empisi) kii baithak 2-4 april ko honi he
 It may be decided to cut the repo rate in this meeting
 agar aisa hua to bainkon ko byaaj daron main katautee kerani hogi or iskaa phayda aapako milegaa
 According to brokerage agency Goldman Sachs report, RBI may cut repo rate by 25 basis points
 report main kaha gaya he, 'aarthik gatividhiyon main lagaataar aa rahi kamajori, sust mahangaai dar or global iconmi kii kamjor padati raftaar ke saath fedral rigerv kaa naram ravaiya is faisle kaa aadhaar ban saktaa he
 The brokerage agency also said that India's GDP 7 in FY 2019
 1 fisadi rahane kii ummid he
 That's 7 in 2020
 5 fisadi rahane kaa anumaan he
 Explain that keeping in mind the retail inflation rate, the RBI decides on the interest rates
 farvari main khudara mahangaai dar maamuli badhat ke saath 2
 Peaked at 57 percent
 yah iskaa chaar maah kaa ucchstar he
 But the annual inflation rate is still low
 vahiin july 2018 se lekar janvari 2019 ke bich lagaataar mahangaai main giravat ai he
 This is the reason why the RBI cut the repo rate by 25 basis points in the February meeting

 In this regard, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das also held a meeting with the officials of the banks
 vahiin arabiai ne apane maudrik rukh ko ''sakht'' se badalakar ''saamaanya'' kar diya he
 Only after the change in policy stance, it was believed that the RBI could provide further relief to cut interest rates

 jajon or loksevakon kii farji or halake maamalon se ''raksha" karne kii kavayad main vasundhara raaje sarkaar kii ore se vidhansabha main rakhe gaye aapraadhik kanoon (rajasthan sanshodhan) vidheyak-2017 ne aate hi acha-khaasaa tufaan khadaa kar diya tha
 This controversial ordinance was brought to practically close the media's tongue, which was strongly condemned by the opposition and the advocacy fraternity and protests were also held
 editors gild of india ne is adhyadesh ke khilaaf kade shabdon main ek bayaan bhi jari kiya
 Realizing its implications, Raje asked a group of ministers and state BJP president Ashok Parnami to review it on the same night (23 October)
 24 aktubar ko vidheyak silect cameti ko bhej diya gaya jo is par bajet satr main report pesh karegi
 In this way, the ordinance will automatically be repealed next week at the end of the current session
 pichley ek saal se adhyadesh kii prakriya jari thi
 It got the approval of Governor Kalyan Singh and before that the Union Home Ministry had also given it mandatory approval because a central law had to be amended
 iske antargat kisi bhi locasevakah mukhyamantri, uski cabinet, chune hue pratinidhiyon, rajya sarkaar ke karmchaariyon or nyaaypalika ke sevarat or sevanivrutt karmchaariyon—ke khilaaf exiar yaa praarambhik jaanch nahin kii ja sakati, jab tak use rajya sarkaar kii ore se manjuuri na mili
 Apparently, the ordinance was inspired by a bill brought by Devendra Fadnavis's BJP government in Maharashtra — the Code of Criminal Procedure (maharashtra Amendment) Act 2015
 usamen bhi siarpisi kii dhara 156 (3) ke tahat exiar ke magistriti aadesh se pehle rajya sarkaar kii taraf se ''jaanch kii manjuuri" die jane kaa praavdhaan he
 The ordinance brought by the Raje government was to take Maharashtra law to a new level
 manjuuri dene ke liye rajya sarkaar ko iske tahat 180 din kii avadhi kii mohalat thi (jabaki maharashtra main yah avadhi 90 din kii he)
 Apart from this, the Rajasthan ordinance also prevents the media from running news of allegations against a public servant
 iskaa ulanghan karne par dhai saal kii jail or arthdand kaa praavdhaan he
 The state government initially insisted that it was being brought to protect public servants from harassment
 grahamantri gulab chand kataaria is baat kii ore dhyaan dilaate hai ki kaise rajya main darj hone vaale exiar ke ek-tihaai (36 fisadi) magistrate ke madhyam se siarpisi kii dhara 156(3) ke tahat darj karaae ja rahe hai
 In this provision of the crpc, the complainant has the convenience that if the police does not register an FIR, he can do so by order of the magistrate
 kataaria kaa kahana he ki zyaadaatar aarope farji or managasaint hai
 They state that out of 2,47,756 cases filed between 2013 and June 2017, only 60,740 were invoiced
 loksevakon ko pehle hi siarpisi kii dhara 197 ke antargat suraksha praapt he jisamen jaanch agency ko abhiyojan kii jaanch se pehle manjuuri leni hoti he
 Now by adding another level of protection, this ordinance was making it more difficult to expose corrupt public servants
 editors gild ne ise ''media ko pratadit karne or samvidhan main varnit press kii aazaadee ke daman kaa khatarnaak aujaary bataaya he
 State Congress chief Sachin Pilot says that "it reflects the dictatorial attitude of the government where it wants to protect the corrupt by suppressing the press
" " rajasthan or maharashtra sarkaar dwaara siarpisi se kii gai chhedchhad ko adaalaton main chunauti di gai he

 Failing to do so, the BJP candidate has also warned the Congress leader to teach a lesson
 mohan kundariyaa ne kaha he ki agar zyaadaatar vot bijepi ke paksh main nahin gaya to iskaa unhen khamiyaja bhugatna padegaa
 Kundaria said that the Kothariya Cooperative Society would be dissolved if the vote did not go to the BJP
 haalanki, mohan kundariyaa ne unke naam se viral ho rahe is audio clip ko galat bataaya he
 He has said that the audio has been tampered with, as the Congress has no issues to contest elections, hence such works are being done
 bataa den ki mohan kundariyaa maujuuda saansad hai or rajkot bijepi kaa garh rahaa he
 Congress has made Lalit Kagathra a candidate in front of Kundaria

 bahuvivaah or halaala ke khilaaf ye teesri yachika supreme court main daayar hui he

 yachikakarta ne kaha he ki bhartiya dand samhita 1860 ke praavdhaan sabhi bhartiya nagarikon par barabari se lagu hone chahie
 The petition also states that triple talaq is cruelty under Section 498A of IPC

 The Congress, which is facing a loss due to the cancellation of votes of 14 of its mlas in Haryana Rajya Sabha elections, has demanded from the Election Commission that the results of the Rajya Sabha election results be canceled

 Anand, who lost the election to bjp-backed Subhash Chandra
 congress party ne aarope lagaaya ki chunaav main sajeesh ke tahat unke ummidavaar ko haraaya gaya or unke vidhayakon ko vot daalane ke liye galat pen de diya gaya jisase unke vot radd ghoshit ho jaaen
 On the complaint of the Congress, the Election Commission has also sought a report from the Returning Officer of Haryana, after seeing which the Election Commission will give its decision in this regard
 surajevaala kaa vot bhi hua raddarajsasabha chunaav main kharid farokht, dal badal or cross voting kii shikaayatein to ab aam ho gai hai
 But this is perhaps the first such case in the country, where the votes of not one, not two, but 13 mlas were declared invalid due to using the wrong pen
 vahiin ek vidhayak randeep surajevaala kaa vot isliye radd ho gaya kyonki unhone apana vot congress vidhayak dal kii netaa kiran choudhary ko dikhaa diya tha
 According to the rules, the vote is secret
 ballat box main daalane se pehle ise kisi ko dikhaane kii anumati nahin hoti
 In fact, in order to keep the votes secret, in the Rajya Sabha elections, all the mlas are instructed not to use their pen and cast their votes only from a special pen kept by the officer for voting
 haryana main voting ke liye chunaav ayog kii taraf se bangnee rang kaa ek marker pen muhaiyaa karaayaa gaya tha, jise sabko istemaal karnaa tha
 But at the time of counting of votes, it was found that 13 Congress mlas cast votes with some other pen
 sonia ko karnaa padaa dakhalasbase hairaani kii baat ye rahi ki purv mukhyamantri bhupinder hooda ne apana vot kisi ko diya hi nahin or apana ballat paper khaali chod diya
 The 13 Congress mlas whose votes were canceled due to casting votes with the wrong pen are all from Hooda's camp
 hooda ne pehle hi congress haikaman se jaahir kar diya tha ki wo aar

 But when Sonia Gandhi herself interfered directly in this matter, it was believed that Hooda and her close MLA R
 ke
 Will support Anand
 congress haikaman ye bilkul nahin chahta tha ki bijepi se kareebi rakhane vaale subhash chandra chunaav jeeten
 But exactly the opposite happened, Subhash Chandra won easily due to the cancellation of votes from 14 mlas of his rival Anand and Sonia Gandhi was upset
 ab sabase bada rahasy ye ban gaya he ki chunaav ayog ke die gaye pen ko vonting vaale jagah se kisne or kab badla
 The Congress party delegation has complained to the Election Commission in full detail
 haryana main kul 90 vidhayak hai or sabane rajyasabha chunaav main hissaa liya
 According to Congress sources, BJP MLA Aseem Goyal voted at number 73 and his vote was found to be correct
 lekin 74 number se lekar 86 number tak jitne vot daale gaye sabhi galat pen se daale hue mili or un 13 voton ko avaidh ghoshit kar diya gaya
 The allegations against BJP were voted at number 74 and 75th by Kuldeep Bishnoi and his wife Renuka Bishnoi, who recently merged their party with the Congress
 uske baad lagaataar 11 vot congress ke vidhayakon ne daale the
 Surprisingly, when the Independent MLA Jayaprakash cast his vote on the 87th, the right pen came back on the spot and all the three subsequent votes were cast from the right pen and found valid
 congress kaa aarope he ki bijepi vidhayak aseem goyal or nirdilia vidhayak jaiprakash ne mil kar pen kii herapheri kii
 Question: Congress has made this complaint to the Congress Party Election Commission, but questions are arising within this matter within the party itself
 aakhir aisa kaise hua ki ek nahin 13 vidhayak galat pen ke dhokhe main aa gaye? kya ye mahaj ittfa he ki jin vidhayakon ke vot avaidh hue wo sab ke sab hooda ke samarthak hi the? anbhavi netaa hone ke baad bhi randeep surajevaala ne kiran choudhary ko apana ballat paper dikhaakar apana vot kharaab kyon kar liya? hooda ne party haikaman ke kehane ke baavjood apana vot khaali chhodkar barbaad kyon kiya? agar pen main gadabadi dikh rahi thi to vidhayakon ne usee samay isaki shikaayat kyon nahin kii?kya hoga hooda kaa?congress-bijepi par jitne aarope laga rahi he, usase zyada unglia bhupinder hooda par uth rahi hai
 Now the buzz among the Congress leaders is whether the high command can muster the courage to take action against Hooda
 kyonki hooda ne baagi tevar to dikhaae hai, lekin haryana congress par unki majboot pakad ko congress main har koi jaanata he or aise bhi is samay congress ke din kharaab chal rahe hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is taking every possible step to win in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, so that the party can benefit

 With the selection of candidates for the general election, the BJP is making a ruckus in the selection of its candidates
 bhaajapa ke ranneetikaron kii maane to party nahin chaahati ki kisi aise pratyaashee kaa chayan kar liya jaae, jise party netaa hi nahin balki bhaajapa kaaryakarta hi asweekaar kar den

 loksabhaa ummidavaaron kii nakaaratmak or sakaaratmak donon pahaluon ko dhyaan main rakhkar khufia report taiyaar karai ja rahi he
 According to sources, if the party feels that the negative aspect of a candidate is overshadowing its positive aspect, then its claim can also be terminated
 party ke ek padaadhikari ne bataaya ki is uljhan se baahar nikalne ke liye shah ne ek aisi khufia team taiyaar kii he jo un netaaon or loksabhaa ke daavedaaron ke sach kaa pataa laga rahi he, ki janata ke bich unki chhavi kisi he, ve janata ke bich kitne lokapriy hai or janata ke bich kitna kaam kar rahe hai
 Sources reveal that this intelligence team is examining the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's rally as well as the activism of BJP workers
 is team kii report par hi party main kaaryakartaaon kaa bhavishya tay hoga
 This team is also engaged in knowing the ground reality of its workers in the party
 team modi kii reliyon main har kaaryakarta or netaa kii sakriyata ko parakh rahi he or apni report ek website ke jariye pahunchaa rahi he
 a senior party leader, on the condition of anonymity, said that the party is blowing every step regarding the Lok Sabha elections
 har loksabhaa seat par jin naamon kaa panel taiyaar kiya gaya he, un sabhi ummidavaaron ke vyavhaar, janata ke bich unki upasthiti or janata ke bich unki chhavi kya he, jaisi tamaam jaankariyaan ekatra kii ja rahi hai
 When asked by this senior leader whether these teams were acting on Shah's instructions, he said that apparently being in-charge of the party, every tactic is being used in his consultation only
 party ke sutara bataate hai ki yah team party ke kuch varisht logon ke hi sampark main hai

 Narendra Modi-led Central Government, which has completed the journey from the Chief Minister of Gujarat to the chair of the Prime Minister of the country, has completed three years
 20014 ke lok sabha chunaavon ke vakt puure desh main chali modi lahar ne narendra modi ko ek brands bana diya he
 This is the reason that during the assembly elections, the state-level leadership tries their best to get Modi's public meetings, rallies and road shows done as much as possible in their respective states
 khaas baat yah he ki narendra modi bhi rajyon kii maang puri karne main koi kasar nahin chhodte
 Significantly, Modi himself addressed 20 rallies in Uttar Pradesh
 aaj modi sarkaar ke teen saal puure hone ke uplakshya main ham aapako 5 ve baaten bataaenge jo yah sabit karengi ki pichley teen saalon main narendra modi ek brands ban kar ubhare hai
 BJP became the largest party After the BJP won the 2014 general elections, the pair of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah went on to record the victory of the state assembly elections
 iske saath hi pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa raajnneetik aadhaar bhi lagaataar failata rahaa
 Adding to Jammu and Kashmir, 14 states of the country are now ruled by the BJP
 jisamen uttar pradesh, rajasthan, madhya pradesh, uttarakhand, maharashtra, goa or gujarat jaise mahatvapurn rajya hai
 Overall, it can now be said that more than half of India's population is ruling the BJP
 iske alaava bijepi ne duniya kii sabase badi party banane kaa record bhi darj kiya
 On becoming the largest party, Amit Shah credited the hard work of the workers for achieving this goal and said, "I take pride in saying that BJP is around 10
" 5 karod sadasyon ke saath vishwa kii sabase badi party ban gai he
 'BJP won in many states in the name of Modi
 In all the states held after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the elections were fought in the name of Narendra Modi and public welfare works of the Modi government at the center
 isamen dilli, bihar or punjab kii haar ko chhod den to baaki sabhi rajyon ke vidhansabha chunaavon main yaa to bijepi ko satta mili yaa phir vah sammanjanak sthiti main rahi
 During this time, Modi has been seen in all elections from pamphlets, cats to hoardings and social media
 2014 ke baad ke chunaavon main modi sarkaar ke dauraan hui sargical strike, notebandi or ujjwala yojana kaa jamkar prachaar-prasar kiya gaya or yah kargar bhi rahaa
 The political system of Modi vs All became India, just as the politics of the country at one time was Congress vs All, in the same way these days the political situation of the country is the same as Modi vs All

 He says that the way we, along with our arch rival Nitish Kumar in Bihar, defeated the BJP, in the same way, we will also run away from the politics of the Center
 yahaan itihaas main van banaam ol kii baat karen to 1971 main indira gandhi ke netritv main congress ko 352 siten milane or 1975 main apatkaal lagane ke baad 1977 ke chunaavon main chaar partiyon (congress (o), jan sangh, bhartiya lok dal or socialist party ne ek saath chunaav ladaa or congress ke 189 ke mukaable us 'mahagathbandhan' ne 345 siton par jeet darj kii
 Apart from this, the Lok Sabha elections held in 1984 are also important in history
 in chunaavon main rajeev gandhi ke netritv main congress ko kul 514 siton main se 404 siton par jeet hasil hui
 The special thing is that this time a regional party (telugu Desam Party), which emerged as the main opposition party in the country's Parliament, won a total of 30 seats while the CPI (M) got 22 seats
 iske baad 1989 ke chunaavon main bhi vipaksh ko congress se takaraane ke liye ek hona padaa or desh ne ve

 The words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which have been said in Modi rallies to be the trend setter in Indian politics, are so well liked by the people that all of them fall into the trend
 sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas, abaki baar modi sarkaar, desh kaa chaukeedaar, na khaauungaa na khaane duungaa jaisi baaten aae din log bolte rahete hai
 Keeping in mind Modi's social engineering, the rest of the political parties also changed their plans and talked about the development of all sections, but in all the states, the people of other parties rejected the whole thing

 petm ne google pement system kii privesi policy ke bare main kaha he ki google bhartiya yugers kaa pement data dusron ke saath share kar rahaa he
 According to an ET report, Paytm said in a letter to NPCI, "google is an unregulated platform where their customer data is likely to be used for money which is an attack on user privacy"
 petm kaa ye bhi kehnaahai ki google yujar kaa data bharat ke baahar store kar rahaa he or share kar rahaa he jo data brich par suraksha se jude sawaal khadey karata he
 Significantly, whatsapp has started a trial to launch a payment service in India
 lekin petm ne watsap pement par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 According to Paytm, whatsapp payment service is not secure and one of the reasons for this is the lack of login and log out option in whatsapp
 petm ke is notice ke baad NPCI ke siio or enpisiai ke managing diarector dilip asbe ne kaha he, ‘haal hi main watsap ko apni parent company fasebuk ke saath yujar data share karne se manaa kiya gaya tha
 In such a situation, if Google Pay shares the user's personal data with Google Group companies under its policy, then it is worrying
 kyonki inamen third party companiyaan bhi shaamil hai
 Google already has our social data and hopefully it is now also accessing our payment data which can be used for money

 Regarding the results of the Gujarat assembly elections, Nitish Kumar has said that only BJP will win in Gujarat elections
 unhone kaha ki jis praant ke pradhanmantri hon, us praant kii janata apane piem se alag vot kyon karegi, kuch bhaawanaaon ko bhi samajhnaa chahie
 Taking a dig at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, Nitish Kumar said that only the media has kept Rahul up, but after the elections are over, this is what the media will know
 gujarat chunaav 2017ke bahaane mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne phir se loksabhaa or vidhansabha chunaav ek saath karaane kii vakaalat kii
 He said that every year elections are held somewhere and the media makes that election a semi-final
 yah tab tak sthiti main parivartan nahin aayega, jabatak ek saath loksabhaa or vidhansabha, panchayat raaj, nagar nikaay saare chunaav ek saath na ho jaae
 He said that this is not possible immediately, but talks should start from now on
 iske liye shaayad samvidhan main bhi kuch parivartan karnaa padega
 Nitish Kumar stressed that everyone's consent is needed in this
 yah tatkaal sambhav nahin he
 For this, something should be made upfront about this and if the provisions of the constitution are to be changed, then it should be done
 lekin yah turant sambhav nahin he
 The first was until 1967
 lekin mid turn pole kii vajah se sthiti ai he

 jaise hamen upi kevidhansabha chunaavamein aashaa thi ki kya hone vaala he
 Nitish Kumar said with the claim that people of the area from which the Prime Minister is from, will not vote for anyone else
 meri to apni samaj he ki gujarat main BJP duusare dhang se kaam karti he
 As far as my own thinking and understanding is, based on what i have thought and assessed about various states till date, i can say that there is no threat of any kind for BJP in Gujarat elections
 vah bahut acchhee safalataa hasil karegi
 According to Nitish Kumar, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi is not going to gain much from the Gujarat elections
 unka maananaa he ki rahul gandhi ne bhrashtachar ke mudde par audines fada tha
 Then his graph went up, but what happened later, the same will happen after the Gujarat elections
