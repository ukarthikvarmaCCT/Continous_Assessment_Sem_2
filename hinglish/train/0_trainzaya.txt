 Shortly before the Lok Sabha elections, the revelations made by American cyber experts have caused a stir in Indian politics
 export ne somvaar ko chunaav main istemaal hone vaale EVM ko lekar kai khulaase kiye to vahiin purv kendriya mantri gopinath munde kii maut ko lekar bhi khulaasa kiya
 According to the hacker, his nephew and NCP leader Dhananjay Munde has demanded an investigation on the revelation that Gopinath Munde was killed
 dhananjay munde kaa kahana he ki gopinath munde kii mrityu kii jaanch ro anyathaa supreme court ke jaj kii aguwai main honi chahie
 Munde, the leader of the opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council, expressed surprise at the claim of an Indian self-styled cyber expert living in the US
 unhone kaha ki gopinath munde se prem karne waalon ne unki mrityu par hameshaa sawaal uthaaya he, unhone poocha he ki yah durghatana thi yaa koi sajeesh
 Significantly, Gopinath Munde died in a road accident in Delhi within a few weeks of the BJP winning the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 a cyber expert has made a sensational claim that former Union Minister Late Gopinathrao Munde saheb was murdered
 This claim needs immediate attention and investigation from RAW / Supreme Court, as it is directly linked to the death of mass leader
 # evmhacking1 / 2— Dhananjay Munde (@dhananjay_munde)january 21, 2019somvaar ko landan main ek press conference ke dauraan sibar export ne unki maut se judaa bada khulaasa kiya
 Expert Syed Shuja claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party's victory in 2014 was due to a scandal in evms, the secret of which Gopinath Munde knew was why he was murdered
 export kaa daawa tha, 'enie adhikari tanzil ahamed munde kii maut ko hatya bataate hue exiaar daakhil karne vaale the lekin unhone khudakushi kar lee
 'let me tell you that during a press conference in London, cyber expert Syed Shuja claimed that the 2014 Lok Sabha election was rigged, which helped the BJP win a big victory
 itnaa hi nahin export ne ye bhi daawa kiya tha ki 2015 ke dilli chunaav main usne aam aadmi party ke liye iviem hack kiya tha
 Only after this disclosure, many types of questions are being raised once again on evms
 vipakshi partiyaan bhartiya janata party par nishaanaa saadh rahi he, to vahiin bijepi ne landan kii is press conference main kapil sibbal kii maujuudagi par sawaal khadey kiye hai
 However, the Election Commission rejected all claims made in this press conference and called evms absolutely safe

 But Harvard University has strongly objected to Misa releasing her photos on stage on social media

 Currently, neither the RJD President Lalu Yadav has received any response to the issue and the entire controversy nor did Misa Bharti on the US tour, but certainly Misa's political career will be adversely affected after the controversy

 Father taught me to win by celebrating my defeat

 i slept on the railway platform for 27 days

 When a boy from a small town can become a Dhoni captain, anything can happen in life

 If i don't show my character on screen, how do you know what my character is
 19
 i am not afraid of failure, just my health should be fine

 It is very important to express feelings
 haal main hue hockey sankat ke dauraan lage aropaan se aahat e ke mattu ne hockey india ke adhyaksh pad samet vibhinn khel sansthaaon ke anya prashasnic padon se istipha diya
 Mattoo sent his resignation to Suresh Kalmadi, President of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and he has made up his mind to retire from sports administration
 mattu ne kaha, ‘maine kalmari ko apana istipha saunp diya he or ab main khel prashasan se sanyas lenaa chahta hum
 i have served for 40 years
 maine lambii or acchhee pari kheli
 Apart from the president of Hockey India, Mattoo is the treasurer of the IOA and the 2010 Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee
 yah puche jane par ki agar kalmari unase is faisle par vichaar karne ke liye kahenge to kya ve aisa karenge, is par mattu ne kaha, ‘nahin, maine apana man bana liya he or main phir se in chizon main nahin padana chahta
 i enjoyed my tenure as a sports administrator for so many years
 apni eemaandaaree or sachaai ke liye mashhoor mattu ne sweekaar kiya ki bahishkaar karne vaale hockey khilaadiyon or anya adhikariyon ne un par jo aarope lagaaye or jis tarah se is sankat ko dikhaaya gaya, isse vah bahut aahat hai
 Asked what was the reason for him to quit, Mattoo said, "this is one of the many reasons
" nishchit rup se isane bhi mere faisle main ahm bhoomika nibhaai he
 He said that Kalmadi had not told him anything about his resignation
 mattu ne kaha, ‘kalmari ne mujhase abhi tak koi baat nahin kii he ki unhone meraa istipha sweekaar kar liya yaa nahin
 If i am asked to continue in the post till the Commonwealth Games, i would not like to do so
 ’ mattu ne kaha ki unhen farvari-march main hone vaale aagaamee hockey vishwa cap ke aayojan or aktubar main rashtramandal khelon ke safal hone main koi andeh nahin he
 Mattoo's tenure as Hockey India president was to end on February 7 and Hockey India elections would be held on the same day, which would constitute a new committee
 har saal kii tarah is saal bhi railway bajet aane kii taiyaari main he
 There will be discussion whether the ticket rates will be cheap, what steps are being taken to run the bullet train soon, etc
 lekin ye charchaa badi mushkil se hoti he ki gramin ilaake ke logon ke liye sarkaar ne kya kiya
 In the city, people raise their voice for their demands but in rural areas this cannot be done, so there is nothing for them to increase the stoppage of some trains in the railway budget
 iskaa nazaaraa aapako dekhnaa he to aapako bihar yaa odisha jaise rajyon main jane kii zarurat nahin he balki aaie viksit kahe jane vaale gujarat rajya main
 a train runs here, between Nadiad and Modasa, the two important cities of the state
 kareeb 100 kilometre kaa safar ye train din main 4 baar tay karti he yani do baar modasa se nadiyaad or do baar nadiyaad se modasa
 Everyday around 1500 to 2000 passengers travel in this train throughout the day
 lekin agar aap is train main safar karenge to aapako vikaas se pehle train yatayaat kaisaa rahaa hoga iskaa ehsaas hue bina nahin rahegaa
 There are about 16 gates on this route
 aam taur par aisa hota he ki aap phatak par pahunchen or train aanevaali he to phatak band ho jaataa he or train jane ke baad phatak khul jaataa he or saamaanya yatayaat shuru ho jaataa he
 But the opposite happens here
 yahaan ke 16 main se kisi phatak par koi railway karmchaaree nahin he
 So in case of no accident, two people travel daily in this train to close the gate
 har phatak se pehle yatayaat saamaanya chalata he lekin train ruk jaati he
 a person descends and closes the gate and signals the train to leave and climbs into the driver's rear box
 train phatak paar kar phir ruk jaati he
 a man descends from the box behind the guard, opens the gate and then climbs
 tab train aage babbti he
 Due to this, this entire train has become just a slow train
 ek or baat is root par chalane vaale yatriyon ko akharati he
 Normally you send your scooter, bike or car to service every little time and walk on another ride till you come back
 vaisaa in yatriyon ke saath bhi hota he
 Every week on Friday, this train only comes in the morning and goes back in the evening
 is bich ye train paas ke shahar aanand main sarvice ke liye jaati he
 Hence, the passengers here travel by bus during this time
 itnaa kam ho to is root par chalane vaale steshnon main zyaadaatar jarjar haalat main hai
 No seating facilities, roof terrace nor water or toilet facilities
 ye sirf ek root kii baat nahin he
 Here another train runs from nearby Anand district to Kathana Town to Vadodara Junction
 is root par ek stesan aata he borasad
 Although Borsad is not very big nor equal, it is a middle class town
 iskaa zikr isliye bhi zaruri he ki ye ek viipi stesan he
 Bharat Solanki was an MP from the UPA government, who was also the Minister of State for Railways
 borasad unka apana shahar bhi he
 But the condition of this station is also the same
 yahaan par na to shauchalay hi he isliye aane vaale log khuli jhaadiyon main bhi shouch kar lete hai
 We asked that crores of rupees are being spent on the Swachh Bharat Mission and such informative advertisements have also been made so that open defecation can be stopped
 ek yatri chandubhai se jawaab mila iskaa ek hi rasta he ki shouch lage to bhi na jaayen kyonki shauchalay hai hi nahin
 If it was built earlier, it was never cleaned and only the locks were installed
 pine kaa pani bhi nahin he
 It was around one o'clock in the afternoon and the sun had reached the forehead
 ek parivaar main bachche pani ke liye bilakh rahe the
 When asked, the female passenger Gulshan said that there is no water here and today she forgot to bring it from home in a hurry
 unhone aage bataaya ki sirf pani or shauchalay hin nahin balki yahaan bijli bhi nahin he
 You realize this in the morning train
 subah saat baje yahaan ek train aati he or tab agar aap bacchon ke saath aaen to andhere main puraa stesan bhutiya prathit hota he
 The children remain afraid until the train arrives
 sirf bachche hi nahin, bado ko bhi dar lage aisa maahaul hota he
 The comments tikat counter par bhi makadi ke jaale the or andar kisi ne bathroom kar diya tha isliye vahaan se tej badboo aa rahi thi
 We felt that perhaps the facilities would not have given the benefit of free travel in shame
 lekin yah soch hi rahe the ki ek vyakti motor saaikal par aayaa or ek khambhe ke paas rukaa
 It was written on the pillar, we get tickets here vah paan kii dukaan kii tarah tikat kii dukaan sajaakar baith gaya
 Started distributing tickets to people
 hamane poocha bhai aap tikat dete ho? stesan par suvidhaayen hi nahin hai
 This man of Mazhar Malik told that he is not an employee of the railway
 usne sirf tikat bechney kaa theka liya hua he
 So when the train is about to arrive, it arrives 15 - 20 minutes before that and goes after selling tickets
 is puure stesan par railway kaa ek bhi karmchaaree nahin he
 When asked, the railway administration said that these routes run at a loss
 yahaan par itani thik kamai nahin hoti ki yahaan par paisa lagaaya jaae
 On this, some travelers remembered that they were saying that it is the government that the traders who say things about loss
 kya sarkaar kaa kaam nahin he ki logon se jo tex vasuul karte hai, us paise se sabhi deshavaasiyon ko bina phayda nuksaan soche, suvidhaayen pradaan karen
 If this remains so, it has not happened till now and rural areas will have to be deprived of railway facilities even further
 lekin unhen umid he ki kabhi koi sarkaar to aegi jo gaanvon ke logon ke bare main sochegi - aakhir aadhe se zyada bharat ab bhi gaanvon main hi rahata he
 a train runs here, between Nadiad and Modasa, the two important cities of the state

 lekin unhen umid he ki kabhi koi sarkaar to aegi jo gaanvon ke logon ke bare main sochegi - aakhir aadhe se zyada bharat ab bhi gaanvon main hi rahata he
 Generally it happens that when you reach the gate and the train is coming, the gate closes and after the train leaves the gate opens and normal traffic starts
 lekin yahaan ulta hota he
 There is no railway staff at any of the 16 gates here
 lihaaza koi durghatana na ho jaae isliye phatak band karne ke liye do log rozaana is train main hi safar karte hai
 Traffic runs normally before each gate but the train stops
 ek vyakti utarataa he or phatak band karke train ko jane kaa ishaara karata he or driver ke peeche vaale dabbe main chadh jaataa he
 The train stops again after crossing the gate
 guard ke peeche vaale dabbe se ek vyakti utarataa he phatak kholta he or phir chadh jaataa he
 Then the train moves forward
 isi ke chalate ye puri train sirf dhimi gati kii train banakar rah gai he
 One more thing is for the passengers on this route
 aam taur par aap apana scooter, bike yaa car har thode samay par sarvice main bhejte ho or waapas aane tak duusari sawari par chalate ho
 The same happens with these travelers
 har saptaah shuukravaar ko ye train sirf subah aati he or shaam ko waapas jaati he
 Meanwhile, this train goes to the nearby city of Anand for service
 isliye yahaan ke yatri is samay ke dauraan bas main hi safar kar lete hai
 If so, most of the stations running on this route are in a shabby condition
 na baithne kii suvidha, na chat kaa thikaana or na hi pani yaa shauchalay kii vyavastha
 It is not a matter of just one root
 yahaan paas ke aanand zile main ek or train chalati he kathana toun se vadodara jankshan tak
 a station comes on this route, Borsad
 borasad vaise to bahut bada bhi nahin or na hi ekadam na ke baraabar he, yah madhyam shrenee kaa kasbaa he
 It is also important to mention that this is a VIP station
 upie sarkaar main bharat solanki yahaan se saansad the joki rail rajya mantri bhi the
 Borsad is also his own city
 lekin is stesan kii haalat bhi waisi hi he
 There is neither toilets here, so people who come and defecate in open bushes
 hamane poocha ki svachh bharat mishan par karodon rupye kharch kiye ja rahe hai or aise gyanavardhak vigyaapan bhi bane hai taaki khule main shouch ko roka ja sake
 The only way to get a reply from a traveler Chandubhai is that even if there is no toilet, do not go because there are no toilets
 pehle bane honge to kabhi safai nahin hui or sirf taale hi lage hai
 There is no drinking water either
 dopaher ke kareeb ek baje the or suraj maathe par chadh aayaa tha
 In a family, children were crying for water
 poocha, to mahila yatri gulshan ne kaha yahaan to pani he nahin or aaj jaldbaazi main vah ghar se laana bhul gai thim
 He further explained that there is not only water and toilets but there is also no electricity
 iskaa ehsaas aapako hota he subah savere kii train main
 a train arrives here at seven o'clock in the morning and then if you come with the children, the whole station looks ghostly in the dark
 bachche jab tak train nahin aati dar ke maare dubake rahete hai
 Not only children, elders are also afraid of such an environment
 tippaniyan There were spider webs at the ticket counters as well and someone had turned the bathroom inside, so there was a strong smell from there
 hamen laga ki shaayad suvidhaayen nahin hai to sarkaar shame ke maare muft yatra kaa phayda detii hogi
 But thinking that a person came on a bike and stopped near a pole
 khambhe par likhaa tha yahaan tikat miltaa he
 He sat down, decorating the ticket shop like a paan shop
 logon ko tikat baantne laga
 We asked, brother, do you give tickets? The station does not have facilities
 majhahar malik m ke is shaks ne bataaya ki vah railway kaa karmchaaree nahin he
 He has only contracted to sell tickets
 isliye jab train aane vaali ho, usase 15 - 20 minute pehle vah aa jaataa he or tikat bechakar chalaa jaataa he
 There is not a single railway employee at this entire station
 poochne par railway prashasan ne bataaya ki ye root nuksaan main chalate hai
 There is not enough money to invest here
 is par kuch yatriyon kii baat yaad ai jo kah rahe the ki ye sarkaar he ki vyapaaree jo nafe nuksaan kii baaten kehete hai
 Is it not the government's job to provide facilities to all the people, without any loss of money, by providing tax to the people? agar aisa hi rahaa to ab tak nahin hua or aage bhi gramin ilaakon ko railway kii suvidhaon se vanchit hi rahanaa padegaa
 But they hope that at some time a government will come which will think about the people of the villages - after all, more than half of India still lives in the villages
 ek or baat is root par chalane vaale yatriyon ko akharati he

 On this, some travelers remembered that they were saying that it is the government that the traders who say things about loss
 kya sarkaar kaa kaam nahin he ki logon se jo tex vasuul karte hai, us paise se sabhi deshavaasiyon ko bina phayda nuksaan soche, suvidhaayen pradaan karen
 If this remains so, it has not happened till now and rural areas will have to be deprived of railway facilities even further
 lekin unhen umid he ki kabhi koi sarkaar to aegi jo gaanvon ke logon ke bare main sochegi - aakhir aadhe se zyada bharat ab bhi gaanvon main hi rahata he
 There were spider webs at the ticket counters as well and someone had turned the bathroom inside, so there was a strong smell from there
 hamen laga ki shaayad suvidhaayen nahin hai to sarkaar shame ke maare muft yatra kaa phayda detii hogi
 But thinking that a person came on a bike and stopped near a pole
 khambhe par likhaa tha yahaan tikat miltaa he
 He sat down, decorating the ticket shop like a paan shop
 logon ko tikat baantne laga
 We asked, brother, do you give tickets? The station does not have facilities
 majhahar malik m ke is shaks ne bataaya ki vah railway kaa karmchaaree nahin he
 He has only contracted to sell tickets
 isliye jab train aane vaali ho, usase 15 - 20 minute pehle vah aa jaataa he or tikat bechakar chalaa jaataa he
 There is not a single railway employee at this entire station
 poochne par railway prashasan ne bataaya ki ye root nuksaan main chalate hai
 There is not enough money to invest here
 is par kuch yatriyon kii baat yaad ai jo kah rahe the ki ye sarkaar he ki vyapaaree jo nafe nuksaan kii baaten kehete hai
 Is it not the government's job to provide facilities to all the people, without any loss of money, by providing tax to the people? agar aisa hi rahaa to ab tak nahin hua or aage bhi gramin ilaakon ko railway kii suvidhaon se vanchit hi rahanaa padegaa
 But they hope that at some time a government will come which will think about the people of the villages - after all, more than half of India still lives in the villages

 pehle number par salmaan khan, duusare number par akshay kumaar or tisare number par ranvir singh kabiz hai
 In the year 2018, Amitabh worked with Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif in the film Thugs of India
 film haalanki box offis par aundhe munh giri, lekin isse pehle ye film pehle teen dinon main hi 100 karod ke kareeb kaa collection kar chuki thi
 With this, only the star power of Amitabh and Aamir can be estimated
 khaas baat ye he ki amitabh ne saal 2018 main hi rishi kapur ke saath ek lo bajet family film 102 note out main kaam kiya tha
 Not many people were convinced about the success of this film, but due to the acting and excellent content of Amitabh and Rishi Kapoor, the film also managed to collect more than 100 crores

 These mlas are awaiting further instructions from Matoshri to the party high command
 shivasena ke kuch vidhayakon ne india today se baatcheet main kaha ki jo bhi haikaman se nirdesh milegaa wo uskaa paalan karenge

 chunavi charchaa main in dinon ek shabd jo uchhal-uchhal kar jubaan par aa rahaa he, vah he topi
 This is happening with the traditional Muslim cap
 sitambar, 2011 main apane sadbhaavna mishan ke dauraan narendra modi ne ise pahanane se inkaar kar diya tha
 Now in a TV interview, he has again said that he does not believe in the prevalence of the symbols of appeasement, while a picture of BJP President Rajnath Singh wearing a similar hat remains the subject of discussion these days
 bijepi se rishte todane se pehle nitish kumaar ne yah kahkar modi par hamalaa kiya tha ki desh kii parampara aisi he ki isamen topi bhi pahanani padati he or tikaa bhi lagaana padataa he
 As the politics of the country has become, in it, its symbolic importance is being made by wearing cap, tilak, turban or hat or not
 iftaar kii raajnneeti se chalaa yah prachlan dhire-dhire tushtikaran ke pratikon main shaamil hota ja rahaa he
 The sudden flood of Iftar parties in the Lutyens zone of Delhi in the nineties brought the Muslim vote bank and politics in the country's politics back to center stage
 kis netaa ke ghar iftaar party he or koun-koun isamen shaamil ho rahaa he, yah siyaasi galiyaaron main charchaa kaa bada vishay banane laga
 The tradition of photographing the cap and then getting it printed has also become more popular than such iftar parties
 isamen koi netaa na to peeche rahaa or na hi rahanaa chahta he
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who has been considered a leader of liberal image in the BJP from the beginning, has never been behind in this
 bataur pradhanmantri vaajapeyi hameshaa aisi iftaar partiyon main gaye or tapiyaan lagaakar photo khinchvaae
 It is a different matter that in a similar iftar party of the then minister Shahnawaz Hussain, he created a political uproar by asking to build Ram temple and Babri Masjid elsewhere on the birthplace in Ayodhya
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main feel good or india shining par savaar bijepi ne isi pratikatmak or jise ki modi tushtikaran kii raajnneeti kehete hai, ko aage badhaate hue vaajapeyi kii prachaar saamagree main pakistan ke tatkaaleen raashtrapati parvaiz musharraf se milte hue unke photo bhi laga die the, jise lekar aresas ke kai netaaon ne munh banaae the
 But the RSS has also been trying to bring Muslims closer to it through the Rashtriya Muslim Forum
 ye 2004 chunaav ke pehle se chalaa aa rahaa he
 The responsibility has been given to senior RSS leader Indresh, who has been charged and questioned for his involvement in the Ajmer blasts
 isi rashtriya muslim manch ke haal hi main dilli main hue ek kaarykram main bijepi adhyaksh rajnath singh ne muslimon se maafee maangane kii baat kahi thi
 This was seen to be linked to the 2002 Gujarat riots and it is also believed that Rajnath is talking about presenting himself as a liberal leader
 baad main party ne safai dekar rajnath ke bayaan ko rafa-dfa kiya
 The same Rajnath is now posing with a cap
 lakhanu main shiya sampradaay ke dharmaguruon se mil rahe hai
 After this, in the statements of Shia leaders, Rajnath is pitted with Vajpayee and it is said that Muslims are scared of Modi
 yah mahaj sanyog nahin he ki rajnath singh ne gajiabad seat chhodkar lakhanu seat chuni
 The Lucknow seat that became the hallmark of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and a symbol of his legacy in the BJP
 parchaa bharne se pehle rajnath, vaajapeyi kaa aashirwad lete hai or unka diya ang vastra pahanakar parchaa bharte hai
 While the bjp's condition in Ghaziabad seat was not as bad as Rajnath Singh's supporters say
 jaahir he rajnath kaa vaajapeyi kii seat se chunaav ladanaa, shiya dharm guruon kaa rajnath ko vaajapeyi jaisaa bataanaa or isse pehle rajnath kaa galatiyon ke liye musalamaanon se maafee maangane kii baat karnaa, is baat kii ore ishaara karata he ki kis tarah rajnath khud kii atal bihari vaajapeyi jaisi udaaravaadi chhavi pesh karne kii koshish main lage hai
 Interestingly, when Congress President Sonia Gandhi met the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid, Rajnath Singh accused her of doing communal politics
 laalkrishna adwani bhartiya raajnneeti main ek baat ke liye hameshaa yaad rakhe jaaenge
 His Rath Yatra for the Ram temple brought tremendous support to the BJP and led to an unprecedented increase in the party's strength, but he put forward the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee instead of himself for the post of Prime Minister, as Vajpayee kept his liberal image by staying away from the Ram Temple movement Was retained and the BJP could come to power by adding new allies in his name
 kya phir aisa hi ho saktaa he? Even though the opinion polls indicate the NDA getting a clear majority, many leaders in the BJP are still hopeful that if this does not happen, perhaps the government will take on new allies in the name of another leader instead of Modi
 Can be made
 lekin ve shaayad bhul jate hai ki hindutv ke poster boy kii apni chhavi par modi ne ab vikaas kaa chola bhi odh liya he
 Even though Modi may not be able to create an image like Vajpayee yet, but there is little chance that another leader can get a chance while under him
 isliye abhi chaahe koi topi lagaae yaa phir tikaa, 16 may ko kiskaa raaj tilak hoga, yah dekhnaa abhi baaki he

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the neighboring country on its Independence Day, despite the bitterness in relations between Pakistan and India in the wake of the recent attacks in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab
 piem modi ne twit kiya, pakistan ke logon ko unke swatantraaa diwas par badhai evam shubhakamanaayen

 tippaniyan The terrorists who attacked both these places had infiltrated into India from Pakistan
 udhampur main hamalaa karne vaale ek aatankwaadi ko jinda pakadaa gaya tha
 The relations between the two countries suffered another setback recently when Pakistan refused to invite the Speaker of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly to the conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association

 Chhattisgarh's Revenue Minister Jaisingh Agrawal lashed out at the former collector of his district as soon as he took charge
 wo bhi isliye kyonki tatkaaleen colector ne unke jameen se jude ek vivaadit maamle kii jaanch ke aadesh die the
 The then Collector P

 The registry of this land was canceled
 ab jab congress kii sarkaar satta main ai or vidhayak mahoday khud rajasav mantri ban gaye to unhone apane jile ke tatkaaleen colector ke khilaaf morcha khol diya
 Revenue Minister Jaisingh Agrawal said that now the corruption of that collector will be investigated
 tehseeldaar, patawaari, aarai kii aukaat nahin thi ki mere ghar main ghus jaae, lekin tatkaaleen colector ke sangrakshan main yah sab hua tha
 Now IAS p

 Dayanand will definitely get it
 yah tha maamla12 agast 2015 se 30 may 2017 tak pi

 is dauraan korba ke gram chuia main adivasee kii jameen kharidne ko lekar vidhayak jaisingh agarwal or chaar anya ke khilaaf edisnal seshan court korba ne exiaar darj karne ke nirdesh diya tha
 On a complaint earlier in the case, the then Collector of Korba, P
W
 dayanand ne vidhayak jaisingh agarwal kii jameen ko adivasee kisaan kii jameen paae jane par nirastikaran kaa aadesh jari kiya tha
 According to the rules, when any non-tribal buys a tribal land, permission has to be obtained from the collector for it
 colector ne is maamle main apni jaanch report main paaya tha ki vidhayak ne rajasav adhinium kaa ulanghan karte hue is maamle main jameen kii kharidi bikri kii he
 Therefore, they canceled the registry of this land
 iske khilaaf vidhayak jaisingh agarwal ne rajasav mandal se sthagan praapt kar liya tha
 Those who had gone to the registry office with old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees to get their land, house or flat registered in Uttar Pradesh faced a lot of trouble on Wednesday
 zyaadaatar logon kaa kaam to hua nahin, ulte unhen idhar se udhar bhatakana padaa
 The cause of people's problems was an order issued by the Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday, stating that old notes of 500 and 1000 rupees would be accepted in the registry
 pradesh ke tamaam akhabaaron ne bhi is khabar ko pramukhataa se chapa tha
 But when people reached the registry office on Wednesday, they came to know that they could not buy stamp paper from the old note but could pay more than ₹ 2 xxrep 4 0 only as registry fees
 darasal sarkaar ke aadesh ko lekar khud registry vibhaag ke karyaalay main bhi asamanjas kii sthiti thi
 All the lawyers present in the Registry Office of Lucknow were showing a copy of the UP government order issued on Tuesday evening stating that stamp paper and registry fee can be paid in lieu of old note
 lekin jin logon ne puraane note se stamp paper kharidne kii koshish kii unhen stamp nahin mili
 Later, after questioning the officials, it was found that the Uttar Pradesh government changed its order after a while and issued a new order
 nae aadesh main yah kaha gaya ki puraane500-1000rupee ke note se sirf registry shulk adaa kiya ja saktaa he lekin stamp paper nahin kharide ja sakate
 The result of this confusion was that all the people who came to get the registry returned despairingly and the functioning of the registry was almost at a standstill

 The girls brought here after being rescued from the clutches of human traffickers from Barav in Allahabad have made several revelations in Balod, Chhattisgarh
 baraav main desh ke vibhinn kshetron sahit kai deshon kii 400 se adhik ladkiyaan maanav taskaron ke changul main hai
 It has been revealed that Barak is the main base of smugglers
 iskaa sargana sheru sahit zyaadaatar log yaheen ke rahane vaale hai
 Balod Superintendent of Police Sheikh Arif Hussain said that there is a sensitive red light area in Barao, where gangster Sheru has a lot of access
 hamane rajya ke sabhi 14 ladakiyon ko iske changul se baahar to nikaal liya he, lekin abhi unke paas anya rajyon ke 400 se adhik ladkiya hai, jinhen sheru ne red lite aria main laakar deh vyapaar ke dhandhe main utaar diya he
 He said that call details are being scrutinized from the rescued girls about Sheru's business
 uski giraftaar bhi kerani he
 During this time, it will be an effort to bring the girls of other states safe as well
 police ne rajya kii 14 ladakiyon ko bikne se bachaa liya he
 a major case of human trafficking has been revealed in the state
 do din pehle elahabaad ke baraav se chhudaakar laai gayi chah ladakiyon ko ravivaar raat espi ke daftar main unke parijanon se milwaaya gaya
 Detailed information about Sheru's whereabouts and his business is being collected from the recovered girls
 police ne ladakiyon se poochtacha kii, jisamen kai bade khulaase hue hai, jise sunakar police bhi dang he
 It was told that girls from neighboring states of Nepal are also in Barrao along with different states of the country
 in 6 ladakiyon ko jahaan se baraamad kiya gaya, vahaan asal main ecred lite ariatha
 The chief leader had brought innocent girls into the business of sex
 in ladakiyon ko bikne se pehle hi police ne vahaan red maari or ladakiyon ko chhudaa liya gaya
 The girls said that it was an excuse for the gang to go to the orchestra
 inkaa mukhya kaarobaaradeh vyaparhi he
 In this business, girls give them one by one
 pehle ladakiyon ko dikhaave ke liye raat ek se paanch baje ke bich dance karaane le jate hai
 After this, the Ayyash boys who came to see the dance used to deal with them
 giroh ke logon dwaara kam padhi likhi or dance kii shaukeen ladakiyon ko bahala-phusalaakar apane saath le jate the
 Barao is the main base of Sheru
 vah vahiin kaa nivasee he
 So he has good relations with the local policemen there
 police waalon kaa vah unka haftaa unke khate main dalwaataa he
 Girls brought here six months ago are also present
 pehle se laai gayi kai ladkiyaan jism ke kaarobaar main dhakele jane ke baad garbhvatee bhi hai
 Some girls also have small children, who are now unable to get out of that marsh for the sake of children
 ghutghut kar jivan ji rahi hai
 There are also some girls, after knowing about their wrongdoings, their relatives have also broken their relationship with them
 unase koi sampark nahin rakhte
 Allahabad is in the northern India region
 is giroh ne uttar pradesh rajya or iske aasapaas kii garib ladakiyon ko hi shikaar banaaya he
 Mostly the base has kept girls brought from other states including Uttarakhand, Bihar, Uttaranchal, Bhopal, Nepal, Pune, Agra, Delhi
 inhen ek ek kar nilaam kiya jaataa he
 Demand for minor girls is high
 abhi se yah kahana ki arvind kejariwal ne dilli kaa ran fatah kar liya he, naa sirf jaldbaaji hogi, balki anyaaypurna bhi hoga
 So leave the decision of win-loss on the 10th
 lekin is faisle ke bina bhi kuch sanketon ko behad saaf dekha ja saktaa he
 First - Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attack Arvind Kejriwal fiercely during the entire election
 jabaki hona ulataa chahie tha
 The Prime Minister ruling the country should have counted the achievements of his party and Kejriwal attacked him and counted his weaknesses
 modi kii is ranneetik aakraamakata ne kejariwal ko na sirf chunaav ke centre main laa diya, balki us pehle netaa ke taur par pesh kar diya jisase modi ko bhi dar lagata he
 Kejriwal kept doing his work with the muffler tied Masumi throughout the election
 unki yah maasoomiyat, bhale hi vah ranneetik ho, logon ko acchhee lagi
 Surveys that came just before the polling did not delay in bringing this image of Kejriwal outside Delhi
 surveykshan aane kii der thi ki nitish kumaar, sharad yadav, mamata banerjee or ech di devgauda ne kejariwal ko samarthan dene kii ghoshnaa kar di
 These declarations have no practical significance in Delhi in terms of votes
 lekin desh kii siyasat main ye bayaan myne rakhte hai
 Nitish and Sharad have to contest the assembly elections in Bihar after nine months and their fight is with the Modi-dominated BJP
 udhar mamata banerjee kii puri party chitfund ghotaale main aisi fansi he ki ek ke baad ek saansad, vidhayak isaki jad main aata ja rahaa he
 The era of Marxists is passing in Bengal and the BJP is fighting a straight fight
 ye wo netaa hai jo desh main rah-rahakar tisare morche kaa taana-bana bunate rahete hai
 But all these are also not in the capacity to compete with Modi
 darasal, wo itane samay se apane-apane ilaakon kii raajnneeti main hai ki unki rashtriya chhavi nahin ban paati
 Even in the publicity system, he is not able to stand in front of Modi
 upar se bhrashtachar ke aarope unhen sangathit shakti banane se roak dete hai
 In such a situation, Kejriwal has a face which is no less clean than Modi in the cleanliness drive of the country
 ek andolankaaree kii chhavi ke saath hi eemaandaaree kaa bada taj unke sir par sajaa he
 If they conquer Delhi, then there will be those who have pulled the horse of Modi's Ashwamedha Yagna by pulling it back
 aisa hone par madhyam varg main unki chamak pehle se kahin bad jaaegi
 This class is important because no other class of propaganda is more comfortable carrier than this class
 yani unamem ve sari khaasiyaten najar aa rahi hai jo tisare morche kii dhuree banane vaale shaks main honi chahie
 In the kind of political shock that the Congress is going through, it will have no other option but to not support the Third Front to be built around Kejriwal
 ye sari baaten anumaan aadhaarit hai, lekin ataarkik nahin hai
 In the last 1984, in front of the almighty Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, in the same way, within two and a half years, the rock of P
 Singhmanam had come
 soochna kranti se bhare samay main tab ke dhai saal aaj ke nau maheene ke baraabar hi baithenge
 In such a situation, it is very possible that once again the role of anti-incumbency movement is being formed in the country
 khaskar jis tarah america raashtrapati baraak obama ne sampradayikta ko lekar modi ke khilaaf jitna kathor bayaan diya he, vah modi ke khilaaf aa rahi shuruaati khabaron kaa sanket he
 If BJP loses Delhi then their unbeatable image will also be fragmented
 yah haar vipaksh se zyada unki party ke bheetar maujuud haashie kii bheed ko khush karegi
 Anyway, this country is a crazy kind of balance
 ise ankush main rahane vaale hathi to raas aate hai, lekin chutta sand yah kabhi pasand nahin karata
 That is, the circumstances are indicating that Kejriwal should be ready for a new role
 jaahir he ki agar aisi koi bhoomika banati he to uski sakriyata 2017 ke ant main hi khulkar najar aegi kyonki tab tak agle aam chunaav kaa maahaul banane lagegaa
 Yes, it must be remembered that even if Kejriwal comes in the role of VP, it is not necessary that Modi will follow the path of Rajiv
 ho saktaa he wo or bade mukaam banaakar vipaksh kii dhar kund kar den
 But at present, the people who are waiting for the money to open the accounts of Jan Dhan, will not wait much longer
 aise main yaa to khate main dhan aayega yaa modi ke saamne koi veepi aayega
 Today when we talk of women empowerment, it is important to understand that women cannot become empowered only by doing jobs or being self-reliant
 iske jaruri he ki unhen apane adhikaron ke bare main bhi maaloom ho
 But do the 100% women of India know about their constitutional and legal rights
 nahin
 According to a survey data, 65 percent of women in India have no knowledge about their legal and constitutional rights
 vahiin 33 pratishat mahilaon ko apane adhikaron ke bare main aadhi adhuri jaankaree he
 Such women are only 2 percent of the entire country who are fully aware of their rights
 bharat kii 120 karod kii aabaadi main 30 se 40 pratishat mahilaayein hai
 But only 2 percent of women are aware of their rights, the biggest obstacle among women empowerment
 yahaan ham kuch aise adhikaron or kanoonon ke bare main bataa rahe hai, jinase har mahila ko aware hona chahie
 'protection from tampering, Fundamental rights, make arrangements for government' Zero FIR Under this right any woman can complain of molestation or rape from any police station in any city
 aamtaur par yah dekha jaataa he ki police stesan jurm kii un vaardaaton kii exiaar nahin likhte, jo unke kshetra main nahin hote
 Once an FIR is registered in any police station, a senior police officer or SHO of that police station will personally register the FIR by going to the police station area where the incident is related
 privesi kaa adhikarcriminal procedyor code ke under section 164 ke tahat rape maamle main ek mahila apana statement magistrate ke saamne akele main record kar sakati he
 Apart from this, she can also record a statement in front of a lady constable or police officer
 yah us par nirbhar karata he ki vah apana statement kis tarah dena chaahati he
 Sonam Kapoor said in the chat show, 'yes i was molested at an early age'
 Any woman can go to the police station and ask for free legal help
 email yaa chitthee se exaramahila agar police stesan nahin janaa chaahati yaa nahin ja paa rahi he
 In this case, she can also register her complaint through email or by sending a letter
 chitthee yaa email milte hi thane kaa esechao maamle kii jaanch kar exiaar file karavaayega
 After this, the victim can write her statement from home itself
 shikaayat kabhi bheeshikayat darj karaane ke liye auraton ko intjaar karne kii jarurat nahin he
 Because according to the law, she can register her complaint anytime
 yani thana kii police yah nahin kah sakati ki sahi samay par shikaayat na aane kii vajah se maamla darj nahin ho saktaa
 Delhi: Looting, molestation of a woman in a moving train, not arrested in the dark
 According to the order of the Supreme Court, no woman can be arrested before the sun rises or after the sun sets
 mahila kanstable saath ho yaa na ho, kisi bhi haal main ek aurat kii giraftaar raat main nahin ho sakati
 For the arrest, the letter of the magistrate is necessary to explain why the arrest of that woman is necessary at night
 police stesan main interrogation nahiunder section 160 ke tahat ek aurat ko interrogation ke liye police stesan nahin bulaayaa ja saktaa
 Police can interrogate him at home
 par vahaan us mahila kaa parivaar yaa uske dost or mahila consteble kaa hona jaruri he
 Sexual Harassment Complaints Committee should be in every office, as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court, there should be a Sexual Harassment Complaints Committee to protect the rights of women in the office

 The scams coming up in various states of the country in making toilets have also surprised people

 Patna District Magistrate Sanjay Kumar Aggarwal caught this fraud in the departmental review meeting

 With this amount, more than ten thousand toilets were to be built in Patna district
 patna police ko ek diary mili, jisamen yah darj he ki piechaidi ke lekhpal bateshwar prasad singh ne baqayada revenyu stop par aadi seva santhaan naamak enjio kii sachiv suman singh se paanch fisadi kamishan dene kii shart par raashi sthanantarit karne kaa qaraar kiya tha
 In this, many bank accounts came out which were not in any bank

 By the way, the scams of the Swachh Bharat Mission are not limited to Bihar alone
 ab tak uttar pradesh, madhya pradesh, jharkhand, maharashtra, haryana jaise kai rajyon main aise maamle saamne aa chuke hai (dekhen box)
 Parameswaran Iyer, secretary of the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, says, "wherever such scams are coming out, we ask for a report from the state government
 kuch maamle chhattisgarh ke hai
 There are also signs of huge irregularities in toilet construction in Mumbai, Maharashtra
 artiai kaayakarta anil galgali ne soochna ke adhikaar ke tahat pichley saal 27 july ko brihnmumbai nagar palika (biemasi) ke solid west management department kii aantarik report hasil kii he
 The then Deputy Chief Engineer of the Slum Sanitation Program prepared an internal report on irregularities in the repair of the community toilet block, which he forwarded to BMC Commissioner Ajoy Mehta in January last year
 galgali kehete hai, ‘‘isse kareeb 200 karod ru
 The alleged irregularity has been revealed
 agast main mukhyamantri karyaalay ne mujhe jawaab diya tha ki meri jaanch kii maang ko sambandhit vibhaag ko bhej diya gaya he lekin ab tak isaki koi jaankaree nahin di gai he
 According to Galgali, BMC has spent Rs 3 lakh for the construction and maintenance of toilet seats in at least four wards

" ’’ galgali kaa aarope he ki is gadabadi kii jaanch ko thande baste main daal diya gaya he
 Similarly, in Kalapani Panchayat of Bhopal district in Madhya Pradesh, contractor Syed Kabir allegedly took out money in the name of villagers by showing 400 toilets built on paper

 The name of Rakesh Kumar Patel is present in the list of toilets constructed 2015-16 of Gram Panchayat Kuruhu in Banda in Uttar Pradesh
 unke naam se shauchalay nirmaan kaa paisa bhi nikaal liya gaya he
 But he neither took money nor built his toilet
 rakesh akele nahin hai
 Dozens of people in the village have been extorted and they do not even know
 yahaan shauchalay banavaane ke liye 2016-17 main suchi jari hui
 The names of 95 people were in this list
 lekin ab tak ek darjan shauchalay bhi nahin ban paae hai
 a rural Koduram wrote a letter to the Prime Minister's Office about this
 isi saal 18 janvari ko pradhanmantri karyaalay ne uttar pradesh ke mukhya sachiv se shauchalay main gadabadi kii jaankaree dene ko kaha
 Complainant Koduram told India Today that after the letter from the PMO, the village head started construction of the toilet shown in the paper at afra-tafri, but it is being hastily dug up by shoddy pipes and digging a pit of two feet each
 
 koduram ne agar chitthee nahin likhi hoti to 95 shauchalayon kaa paisa hajam ho gaya tha
 But Banda's DM Divya Prakash says, "I am not aware of it
" ho saktaa he, sidio ko ho

 It is alleged that the expenditure is shown in construction on paper only
 isi block main saansad bhairon prasad mishra kaa god liya hua gaanv katra kalinger bhi he
 RTI activist Ashish Sagar says that he had complained about this long ago, but the authorities have been protecting the scamsters on the pretext of not completing the investigation
 yah us banda jile kii tasviir he jisamen ek maah pehle tak dm rahe mahendra bahadur pramukh sachiv se shauchalay nirmaan main behatar kaary karne kaa pramaan patr hasil kar laae the

 People's thinking has also changed with the toilet here

 His wife Radha says, "I have quit going to the toilet after the toilet is built

 The 2011 census reduced the figure to 32 percent
 2014 main 38 fisadi he
 What kind of breakup is this in statistics? In 2010, the ministry's figure was 65 per cent
 2011 main yah 32 fisadi tha
 After this, a detailed baseline survey was done in 2012-13, when rural sanitation was found to be around 34–35 per cent
 yah janaganana ke aankadon ke aasapaas thahartaa tha
 This figure became our base data
 ab ham 76 fisad se adhik kawarej par hai
 About 4-5 months ago, based on the Quality Council of India's survey of nearly 100,000 homes, our MIS coverage figure was around 73 per cent
 third party survey ne is aankade ko 72 fisad paaya
 That is, we were very close
 ab hamen puraa bharosa he ki emies ke aankade ekadam khare hai
 The baseline survey is for 2012, according to that survey 100% of the odfs are there but the ground reality is something else? In some cases like the baseline survey in Bihar some figures are overpowering
 lekin aakhri manzil to gaanv ko odief banane kii he
 There may be minor flaws, which are taken care of at the time of ODF verification
 lekin maharashtra main chandrapura main swatchta puraskaar paae odief gaanv main ek bhi shauchalay nahin he?mujhe iske bare main check karnaa hoga
 Many villages of Jaisalmer do not have toilet, even there is no water? In such areas, pan with less water needs should be installed

 According to reports, terrorists sitting in Pakistan are plotting a big conspiracy to create disturbances during the Lok Sabha elections in India

 or is sabake baad america ne jari kii ek gambhir chetavanee
 The conspiracy of the riots during the Lok Sabha elections in India does not support such ruckus and fighting
 balki wo kanoon par yakeen rakhte hai
 But in our country there are some people here and there
 jinhen asantosh main hi santosh aata he
 In this, they get leisure
 lekin jane anjaane ye log desh ke dushmano kii madad kar rahe hai
 And there are enemies that are sitting by chance

 According to a report by the US Intelligence Agency, if Hindustani continues to fight among themselves, then Pakistan and terrorist organizations flourishing there can take advantage of this by organizing communal riots during the Lok Sabha elections
 america ke neshnal intelligence ke diarector dan kots ne kaha he ki loksabhaa chunaav ke dauraan paak main baithe aatanki sanghathan bharat par hamale bhi kar sakate hai
 The director of the US intelligence agency National Intelligence, Dan Coats, clearly said that the possibility of communal violence in India is very strong if the ruling BJP continues to emphasize the Hindu nationalist theme before the general elections in May

 It is very possible that large-scale communal riots also erupt in the country
 kyonki pakistan to hameshaa se hi ye chahta he ki hindustan main muslim or hindu kabhi ek naa hone paaen
 It is obvious that PM Modi has repeated many times from public platform that the law will be strictly dealt with by those who forcefully attack people in the name of Gau Raksha or in the name of Love Jihad

 Digvijay Singh has compared Modi this time to the German dictator 'hitler'
 digvijay singh ne kaha ki modi poster or hording ke madhyam se kabhi vivekanand, to kabhi balgangadhar tilak to kabhi sardaar vallabh bhai patel banakar swany ko mahimamandit kar rahe hai
 He said that Modi does this to divert people's attention from the ground reality
 unhone kaha ki germany main hitler ne bhi swany ko mahimamandit kar satta hasil kii or taanashaah ban baitha, jabaki modi bhi usee kii raah par chalane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Digvijay Singh said that Modi has now increased his stature in BJP so much that all the leaders of his party have become dwarfed in front of him
 unhone kaha ki bijepi main yah sthiti keval modi ke saath hi nahin balki madhyapradesh main shivaraj singh chouhan or chhattisgarh main mukhyamantri raman singh kii bhi yahi sthiti he
 He said that in both these states also the Chief Ministers have maintained their position like this and here too other leaders are in the background

 Referring to the Medical Examination Scam of the Vyapam Examination Board (vyapam) in Madhya Pradesh, Singh said that now Amir's unworthy son, who has lakhs of rupees, can become a doctor here while the son of the poor cannot become a doctor
 unhone kaha ki yah sthiti madhyapradesh main hi nahin he balki bijepi shasit gujarat, chhattisgarh or jharkhand main bhi he
 He said that the rates of different examinations are fixed in all four BJP ruled states

 Mission Nursery Admission started in Delhi, according to confusionguideline regarding the rules of schools, the process was to start from 2 January and the schools were instructed that by 1 January all schools will upload point system information on their website
 lekin 2 janvari ko jab daakhile kii prakriya shuru hui to EWS ketegory ke liye centralined online aavedan ke liye shiksha nideshaalay kii website par koi soochna nahin thi
 Even the link for the year 2017-18 for admission has not been uploaded
 jisaki vajah se abhibhavak pareshaan najar aa rahe hai
 Nursery Admission: These tips will make it easy to maintain transparency in every commercial admission so the Delhi government started the process of centralized online application for EWS category from last year
 is saal bhi sarkaar ne vahi prakriya apanaai lekin EWS ketegory ke abhibhavakon ke liye online aavedan kii ye prakriya samajhnaa dikkaton se bharaa he
 Nandlal, who came from Indrapuri for admission of his child, knows that the admission will be online but how and where he will not know about it
 ye jaankaree jutaney ke liye wo skool pahunche
 Nandlal said that the process of offline application was easy and there was less scope for making mistakes
 lekin online aavedan main dar bana rahata he
 Parents of EWS category who are also aware of the online process are also distraught because the link for the year 2017-18 has not been updated on the website of Directorate of Education
 jo link website par he wo pichley saal kaa he
 Whereas the Directorate of Education had asked private schools to upload criterias and point systems by Sunday
 general ketegory ke abhibhavak bhi hue pareshanthathsh ketegory ke abhibhavakon kii tarah general ketegory ke wo parents bhi skool dar skool bhatak rahe hai, jinhen didie kii jameen par bane skulon main apane bacchon kaa daakhila karnaa he
 But due to non-release of guidelines, such parents are returning disappointed
 bataa den ki shiksha nideshaalay ne sarkari jameen par bane kareeb 298 skulon ko ravivaar ko ek baar phir circular jari kar daakhila kii prakriya shuru nahin karne kaa aadesh diya he
 In fact, while taking the land from DDA, it was said that schools should give priority to the admission of the children of the area
 skulon ke mutabik wo pehle se hi daakhile main nebarhud criteria ko tavajjo dete rahe hai lekin agar sibling, elumanai jaise duusare criteria ko puri tarah nazarandaaj kar diya gaya toskulaur abhibhavak donon kii mushkilen bad jaaengi
 But the government wants private schools to compulsorily admit children of Neighborhood to 75% open seats

 Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dixit appeared to defend her controversial statement and said that her statement that Rs 600 was sufficient to provide one month's ration to a family of five meant that this amount would help them get the basic ration
 shila ne ek aayojan ke dauraan kaha tha ki ham pariwaron kii mahila sadsy ko har maheene 600 rupye nakad de rahe hai
 The basis of this is that with this amount you can get rice, wheat, and sugar for a family of five to six people
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki hamane kabhi yah nahin kaha ki aap in 600 rupayon se har cheez kharid sakenge
 It is a help for families
 aap is raashi se kuch bhi kharidne ke liye swatantra hai

 During this, the young man received four bullets and died on the spot
 police kii maane to uskaa koi aapraadhik ricard nahin he
 In this case, the matter seems to be entangling in terms of investigation
 is tarah se saream ek yuvak kii hatya ne gudgaanv police kii kaary pranali sawalia nishaan laga die hai
 At present, the police say that a case is being registered and investigation is being done in this regard

 During the West Bengal election campaign, CM Mamata Banerjee attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 banerjee ne shanivaar ko kaha ki piem modi ko is tarah nahin bolnaa chahie
 He speaks the language of the RSS
 piem modi ne asanasol main guuruuvaar ko banerjee par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 TMC chief Banerjee does not believe in personal attacks, accused PM Modi of carrying out personal attacks
 unhone kaha ki maine kabhi kisi netaa par vyaktigat hamale nahin kiye hai
 i also respect Vajpayee ji, Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharya
 meraa kisi se koi gathbandhan nahin he
 Modi reduced the honor of pm's post, Banerjee said that the kind of language that PM has used is going to reduce the dignity of his post
 unhone kaha ki janata dobaaraa bijepi ko aashirwad nahin denevaali
 She will never come to power
 banerjee nepiem modi kosima main rahane kii chetavanee di
 He said that i am not your slave and cannot bear my insult
 bijepi matlab bhayanak jali partimamata banerjee ne modi par hamalaa karte hue poocha ki videsh daure par aapke kaarykram main juty bheed kaa kharchaa koun uthaata he
 i can not speak like you
 aap tiemasi par aatank kaa aarope lagaate rahiye
 Banerjee said that i can say that BJP means terrible burning party, but i take back my words
 main aisearopon kii raajnneetinhee karti
 BJP does not eat without abusing me, Netabanerjee said that even if someone puts me in jail, i will not bow down
 main maut se bhi nahin darati
 It is my wish that i meet or not meet in Delhi
 mujh par koi jor aajamaish nahin kar saktaa
 He said that BJP leaders do not digest food without abusing me
 bengal baantne nahin duungiunhone piem modi par hamalaa karte hue kaha ki main unhembengal ko baantne nahindoongi
 The Prime Minister's job is to carry people across the country together, but Modiji works to distribute them
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki hamaari sarkaar pradhanmantri kisaan sammaan nidhi naam se ek aitihaasik yojana lekar ai he
 This is not the plan that the Congress brings every ten years
 congress ko chunaav aate hi karjamaafee kaa bukhaar aata he
 His scheme benefited only 20 percent of the farmers
 lekin hamaari yojana kaa laabh 90 fisadi kisaanon ko milegaa, jo har saal milegaa
 7 in ten years from what we planned
 5 lakh karod rupaya sidhe kisaanon ke khate main jamaa hone vaala he
 PM Modi also said that we have decided to create Kamdhenu Commission to protect the cow
 jiske liye bajet se 500 karod rupee kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Such big work can be possible only when you work with service
 pichley saadhe chaar saal main aise anek kaam the, jinke bare main sirf charchaa hoti thi
 Now that it has come to the ground, a belief has arisen that Modi is possible
 kai baar bolaa- modi he to mumkin hairajasthan ke tonk main vijay sankalp raily ke saath pradhanmantri narendra modi ne bhartiya janata party ke chunavi abhiyaan kaa aagaaj kiya
 In 2014, the slogan of PM Modi's election campaign was 'achhe Din aanene hain'
 lekin 2019 ke aam chunaav kii dehri par khadi janata ko is maukey par pradhanmantri ne aagaamee aam chunaav ke liye 'modi he to, mumkin he' kaa nayaa naaraa diya
 Addressing a public meeting in Rajasthan's Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot's stronghold Tonk, PA Modi said that the military brothers of Rajasthan would remember how they were made false promises on One Rank, One Pension for 40 years
 aaj javaanon kii shahadat par aansu bahaane waalon ke munh se aisi baat shobhaa nahin detii
 Our government implemented One Rank, One Pension and gave arrears of about Rs 11,000 crore to 20 lakh former soldiers
 ye kaam isliye hua, kyonki 'modi he to, mumkin he'
 PM Modi said that once anyone could have thought that such a government would come in the country which would work to eliminate smoke from the kitchen of the poor
 lekin ujjwala yojana ke tahat rajasthan main 50 lakh pariwaron ko gas silinder die gaye
 Smoke ran out of his kitchen
 yah bhi kaam hua he, kyonki 'modi he to, mumkin he'
 The Prime Minister said that in our country, the scheme of giving houses to the poor has been going on for many decades, but no concrete work has been done
 hamaari sarkaar 2022 tak desh ke har beghar ko pakkaa makaan dene kii disha main tej gati se aage bad rahi he
 1 in four and a half years
 5 karod se zyada garib pariwaron ko ghar kii chaabi de di gai he
 We are moving towards the goal and will achieve it
 ye sambhav ho paaya he kyonki 'modi he to, mumkin he'
 Referring to the Jan Dhan Yojana, PM Modi said that one could have imagined that 2 of Rajasthan in four and a half years
 5 karod logon ke bank khate khulwaaye jaaenge
 It has happened, because 'modi is there, it is possible'
 piem modi ne kaha isi tarah kya koi soch saktaa tha ki sirf 1 rupee maheenaa or 90 paise pratidin ke premium par logon ko 2 lakh kaa beemaa cover milegaa
 7 million people joined it in Rajasthan
 ye kaam hua he kyonki modi he to mumkin he
 Similarly, referring to reservation for the poor of the general class, PM Modi said that there was a demand for reservation for the poor children of the general class in government services and educational institutions for decades
 lekin samvidhan main sanshodhan jaisaa gambhir prayaas kisi ne nahin kiya
 There was also a lack of intention behind it and compulsion of a government without majority
 lekin aaj garibon ko das pratishat aarakshan hakeekat ban gaya he
 This work was also done because it is possible if Modi is there
 aarakshan kii yah vyavastha pehle se mil rahe aarakshan se bina chhedchhad kiye kii gai he
 Mosudul Rahman, an ITBP jawan, fired indiscriminately on his own fellow soldiers at the Kadenar camp in Narayanpur district of Chhattisgarh
 ghatana main chah javaanon kii maut ho gai or teen jakhmi ho gaye
 All the jawans belong to 45 battalions of Indo Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBP)
 haalanki firing karne vaale jawan kii bhi maut is golibari main ho gai
 IG Sundarraj P
 of Bastar
 ne philhal abhi koi bhi kaaran bataane se manaa kar diya
 He said that investigation is being done
 kaarnon kaa pataa chalate hi ve media se use saajha karenge
 But Home Minister Tamra Dhwaj Sahu has made it clear without investigation report
 "the dispute may be the reason behind this incident
" kisi bhi haalat main chhuttiyaan na milanaa is haadase kii vajah nahin he kyonki javaanon ke liye chhuttiyaan tay hoti hai
 The situation will become clearer after the rest of the report comes
 '' udhar rajya ke grih mantri tamradhvaj sahu kah rahe hai, ''chhuttiyaan na milanaa is ghatana kii vajah nahin he
 However, the investigation report is yet to come
 lekin itibipi ke ek andruni sutara ne naam naa chhapane kii shart par bataaya, ''ek saal se zyada samay se unhen chuttee nahin mili thi
 They were demanding frequent leave
 vah pichley kai maheenon se pareshaan tha
 Confirming the same, the jawan of the same battalion said, "there are other people in the battalion who have not been discharged for more than a year
" tanavagrast javaanon ke bich aapasi jhadpen or marpet hona to yahaan roj kii baat he
 "not only that, the jawan told that the Home Minister should stop the rhetoric and get the holiday vacations of the soldiers approved, otherwise it is possible to raise more people
 ''pehle bhi ho chuki ghatnaayen-isi saal march main jammu-kashmir ke udhampur main bhi aisi hi ghatana hui thi
 Here in the camp of the 187th Battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), there was a bloody clash after seeing a debate between the soldiers about something
 ek jawan kaa paara itnaa chadha ki usne apni sarvice rifl se teen saathiyon kii goliyon se bhunkar hatya kar di or baad main khud ko bhi goli maar lee thi
 Earlier in January, a CRPF jawan in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, shot himself after shooting two of his comrades
 -chhattisgarh main do saal pehle bhi aisa haadasa hua tha
 a soldier of the 168th battalion of CRPF opened fire on his comrades in Chintalnar area in Bijapur district here
 is ghatana main chaar javaanon kii maut ho gai thi
 What happened to the circular of the Union Home Ministry? In May 2015, the Union Home Ministry had issued a guideline to the Center Armed Police Forces (CAPFS) to make daily yoga exercises necessary for one million paramilitary personnel of the country
 siepes main central rigerv police forcej (siarpief), border sicurity forcej (biguef), central industrial sicurity forcej (siif), sashastr seemaa bal (esasabi), neshnal sicurity guard (enesji) or indo tibetan border police force (itibipi) shaamil hai
 These guidelines were issued by the CAPFS to the dgs of all the forces
 in dijis ko yogabhyas kii report bhi mantralay ko bhejni thi
 Chhattisgarh, Director General of Police (DGP) d
 em
 Awasthi said that such instructions were given
 kuch jagah yogabhyas karwaae bhi jate hai
 The jawans are sent to the yoga camp
 lekin mushkil yah he ki ek saath sabko bhejnaa sambhav nahin he
 Sometimes many soldiers are on dudy and some are on leave
 jawaano ko training dene ke liye kya yoga prashikshak niyukt kiye gaye hai? is par unka kahana tha ki yoga prashikshak to niyukt nahin kiye gaye hai
 But people go to camps
 unhone bataaya ki aisi ghatnaon ke peeche kii vajah tanaav hi zyaadaatar hota he
 DM Awasthi says, "two years ago when a CRPF jawan shot his fellow jawans, he was also involved in the investigation team
 us vakt buniyadi taur par ghar kaa tanaav yaa phir team ke bich tanaav ahm vajah pai gai thi
 Many times company commanders give more attention to some people and less to some
 kuch logon kii duty lagaataar lagaai jaati he
 The cause came out at the time of CRPF incident
 aatmahatya ke maamle bhi aate rahete hai
 In these cases it is often found that either the young man is preparing to go on leave or he has completed his leave from home
 tanaav ke bich ji rahe jawan apni vyathaa kisase kahen?indian dephence rivyuu jarnal main ‘indian army and management of stress’ sheershak se agast, 2014 main prakashit lekh main sena ke bich tanaav ke kaarnon par hue shodhon kii ek samiksha report jari kii gai
 The main causes of stress in this are isolation, staying away from family, over-discipline and hirarki among the team
 kai baar ghar main kisi sankat ke vakt na pahunch paanaa
 The problem of loneliness is especially high in front of the soldiers deployed at high altitude or in remote areas
 naksali ilaakon yaa tanavagrast ilaakon main hameshaa jaan kaa khatra us par parivaar se dur rahane kii majaburi maansik dabaav badha detii he
 This is called the 'pressure cooker effect'
 kai baar yah saare kaaran milakar itnaa dabaav badha dete hai ki tanaav main aakar jawan aatmahatya kar lete hai yaa phir apane hi saathiyon par golibari kar baithte hai
 Are Councilors appointed for regular counseling to deal with stress? DGP DM Awasthi says, "counselors should be appointed but councilors have not been appointed by the government in Chhattisgarh
 lekin shaayad itibipi ke paas cousanlir hai
 But i am not sure
 ’’ haalanki dm avasthi kehete hai, kai baar ham nijee counciller kii madad jarur lete hai
 ITBP has a stress councilor but
 
 
 itibipi ke personal relation officer (piaaro) vivek pandey ke mutabik chhattisgarh main keval itibipi hi ek aisi paramiletry force he jahaan stress counciller hai
 But is the strength of the Stress Councilor much higher than the number of ITBP personnel? "around 12,000 ITBP personnel are deployed in Chhattisgarh," says Pandey
 takreeban 10-11 batalian hai har batalian main 1000-1200 jawan hote hai
 And for each battalion a stress councilor is appointed

 ravishankar prasad ne kaha ki congress or anya vipakshi partiyaan gusse main aakar khauf kaa maahaul bana rahe hai
 When the public is not getting support, then extremism is being resorted to

 The opposition should stop the orgy of violence
 prasad ne kaha ki bihar main jo bacchee kii maut hui he kyarahul gandhiuski jimmedaari lenge
 Today the government is also worried over the price of petrol and diesel, we are taking necessary steps to reduce it
 abhi jo bhi petrol-deazal ke daam badhen hai, vah sabhi antarrashtriya kaarnon se bad rahe hai
 The Union Minister said that between 2009 and 2014, the petrol has gone up from Rs 39 to 73, our government has also increased some but not as much as the first one
 hamaari sarkaar ne mahangaai ko roka he, jisamen hamen safalataa bhi mili he

 In the yoga system, cancer cells are seen as criminal in society
 koshikaon ke yah samooh khatarnaak sabit hote hai
 Because it can cause great problems
 isi tarah cancer koshikaayen hamaare saare sharir main maujuud rahati hai, lekin unamem se kuch hamaare jivan yaa sharir ko us tarah prabhavit nahin karti
 As long as they are alone then no problem
 haalanki yahi koshikaayen jab badhane lagati hai, to unka hamaari sehat par bura asar dikhaai dene lagata he
 After all, why is cancer? In yoga, we usually see it in such a way that when a certain type of emptiness is created in the energy due to human behavior, food, lifestyle or any other reason, then the cancer cells in our body There is a risk of increasing
 agar sharir ke kisi khaas hisse main urja kaa pravaah thik nahin ho to cancer koshikaayen us jagah ko chupane or phalne-phoolne ke liye chun leti hai
 Cancer is not a disease, but some cells in it turn against you and this causes your body to work against you

 It may not be a treatment for a person suffering from cancer, but it keeps the number of cancer cells in the body under control, so that they are not able to unite against the body
 jab sharir main inkaa str badhata he, to yah koshikaon main urja ke pravaah ko rokte hai or sharir ke ve hisse jahaan urja kaa pravaah nahin ho paata unamem cancer koshikaon ke badhane kaa khatra bad jaataa he
 It acts as an energy extender by the simultaneous intake of neem and turmeric

 yoga or canceryahaa kuch khaas kism kii aadhyatmik tareeke bhi hai, jo sharir pranali ko sudhaare or santulan banane main madad kar sakati hai
 We cannot tell to what extent these methods are helpful for patients suffering from cancer, but we have certainly seen many patients who have completely recovered from these measures
 hamane aise bhi log dekhe hai jo yoga ke jariye chemotherapy ke baad badi hi teji se usase ubar gaye
 The doctors treating those patients were also stunned to see them
 yahaan yah pakke taur par to nahin kaha ja saktaa ki yoga kii vajah se unka cancer thik ho gaya, lekin chikitsiya upachaar ke saath yoga karne se cancer ke marijon ko phayda jarur mila he

 Taking a hit on Monday, Chidambaram asked 'is she giving a clean chit to Pakistan in the 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks'? The former finance minister made several tweets and asked Sitharaman to find Uri and Pathankot in the map of India
 chidambaram ne kaha, 'raksha mantri ne kaha he ki 2014 ke baad se pakistan ne koi aatankwaadi hamalaa nahin kiya he
 Can the Defense Minister pick up the map of India and tell where Pathankot and Uri are? 'he said,' By saying that these attacks were not done by Pakistan, is the Defense Minister giving a clean chit to Pakistan in relation to Pathankot and Uri attacks Huh?' On the second day of the bjp's national session on Saturday, Sitharaman claimed that there had been no major terrorist attack since 2014
 unhone kaha, 'desh main tabaahi machaane ke sabhi prayaason ko seemaa par hi khatm kar diya gaya he or is sarkaar ne sunishchit kiya he ki aatankwaadiyon ko shanti bhang karne kaa koi mauka nahin diya jaae

 Karnataka says that they do not have enough water to drink, so it is not possible for them to provide water for Tamil Nadu crops
 karnataka ne court se yah bhi kaha ki use kanoon evam vyavastha kii sthiti bighad jane kii bhi ashanka he, kyonki donon rajyon ke bich dashakon se chale aa rahe kaveri mudde ko lekar pichley kuch hafton main rajyabar main hinsak pradarshan hue hai
 In a special conversation with NDTV, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said that the Supreme Court's decision to provide 6,000 cusecs of water daily to Tamil Nadu for the next seven days is 'undesirable'
 unhone kaha ki tamilnadu ko pani nahin die jane kaa unka faisla unke hisaab se court kii avmaananaa nahin he
 CM Siddaramaiah of Karnataka said, "the court was told the reality, but even after that such order was given

 Karnataka also told the court that it also feared the law and order situation would worsen, as violent protests across the state over the past few weeks over the decades-old Cauvery issue between the two states

 raajnneeti kaa sabase bada sankatmochak aaj swayan sankat mensharad pavaar kah chuke hai- dilli kii takat ke aage jhukna nahin sikhaamaratha kshatrap sharad pavaar, siyasat kaa ek aisa naam jise raajnneeti kaa sabase bada sankatmochak kaha jaataa he
 Pawar has neither shied away from vying for power nor even supported his opponent when he was in power
 satta chaahe jisaki bhi rahi, pavaar kii hanak kabhi kam nahin hui
 But now the circumstances took such a turn that today the biggest troubleshooter of politics is himself in crisis
 sharad pavaar apana namamaharashtra ko-oparative ghotalemen saamne aane ke baad 27 sitambar ko idi ke daftar main pesh hone kaa elaan kar chuke hai
 Pawar had said that he followed Shivaji's ideals and learned not to bow to the power of Delhi
 pavaar ne chunavi mausam main kadaa bayaan to de diya, lekin vah chautarafa sankat se ghire hai
 Pawar's party, which has stood steadfastly in the Parliament from 1976 to 2014, is also trying to preserve its existence in the politics of Maharashtra
 chunavi mausam or ghotaale kii aanchaaise samay main jab maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke muhane par khadaa he, pradesh main siyaasi sargarmi puure ufaan par he, matdaan main ek maah se bhi kam samay shesh bachaa he, kooparative bank ghotaale kii jaanch kii aanch kaa sharad pavaar tak pahunchnaa na keval unke, balki party ke liye bhi khatre kaa sanket he
 Sharad Pawar has appeared as a troubleshooter for Delhi governments on several occasions, but he himself seems to be beset with crises
 mushkil daur main bhi nahin choda congress kaa sathsharad pavaar ne sonia gandhi ko congress kaa rashtriya adhyaksh banaae jane ke baad unke videshi mul ko mudda banaakar party se istipha de diya tha
 Pawar formed the Nationalist Congress Party and was also a minister in the Dr Manmohan Singh government led by the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance in 2004
 2004 se 2014 ke dauraan manmohan sarkaar kuch maukon par sankaton se ghiri or is dauraan pavaar jaise diggaj kii bhoomika ahm maani jaati he
 After the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when the Congress leaders also started turning away from him, Pawar's party did not avoid the Congress
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle tak vah vipakshi ekajutata or mahagathbandhan ke liye prayaas karte rahe
 However, Pawar's efforts could not bring color to national Kya Maharashtra as well and the BJP won a landslide victory
 kaam na aayaa soft rukhjab congress sattadhari bhartiya janata party par hamalavar thi, sharad pavaar ne rafel ke mudde par modi sarkaar ke prati soft rukh apanaaya
 Even when the BJP and Shiv Sena were in separate fray at the time of BMC elections, Pawar had expressed his desire to support the BJP
 haal hi main ek rajyasabha seat ke liye hue upachunaav main bhi pavaar ne congress kaa samarthan karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 All these steps of the NCP were considered by Pawar to be a message to the Modi government, but the Maratha satraps did not work as well and now the genie of the cooperative scam that came up during the election has raised the political temperature of Maharashtra

 6) i am not angry despite the torture
 4 years i have had to face harassment because of this
 main gussa nahin hum
 i have become very angry in life

 The maneuvers will run throughout the month, however, before now, whenever the United States and South Korea practiced joint military exercises, North Korea would always oppose it
 virodh is baar bhi hua
 But not in that way
 ham aapako bataa den ki america or dakshin korea har saal saajha sainya abhyaas yani military drill karte hai
 This military drill is called the Fol Eagle
 aam taur par har saal ye joint military drill farvari ke aakhri hafte gaye phir march ke pehle hafte main hua karata thi

 'I sing the song of Rahul
 
 
 ' ji haa, is vakt congress main har koi rahul gandhi ke geet ga rahaa he
 Everyone is praising Rahul Baba, be it a party worker or a big leader
 tarifon ke pulon main congressi bijepi kii naiya dubo rahe hai
 When the fort of BJP in Karnataka collapsed, only Rahul Gandhi could be heard in the sound
 karnataka main bijepi ne modi ko khevaiyaa banaaya, ab congressi modi kii khilli uda rahe hai
 BJP is in churn and Rahul Gandhi is in a happy mood
 karnataka main jeet kaa intjaar tha
 There was a chance and there was a competition in the Congress to strike a cheer
 jisaki jaisi samarthy, usne utane jor se rahul gandhi kii jai main jai milaayaa
 The victory of the party in Karnataka directly decorated the head of Rahul Gandhi
 bolti he modi kii tuuti bijepi main
 The BJP would think that Modi's name would cross the electoral fleet, but the voters who wrote the fate of the people who became the destiny of the country, gave Karnataka to the Congress
 bas rahul raag gane ke liye congress ko isse zyada kya chahie?manmohan ne bhi rahul ko diya shreyabade netaa to bade netaa, chote kaaryakarta bhi subhaillah
 The workers who do not have access to Rahul Gandhi, expressed their allegiance by feeding sweets to Rahul in the poster itself, and the Congress who placed him on the biggest political position, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was also seen laying in front of Rahul's name
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh kehete hai ki karnataka main mili jeet kaa puraa shrey rahul gandhi ko jaataa he
 How was victory, why was it won, on what issue was it found
 congress kii chhavi kaam ai yaa bijepi kaa bantaadhaar rang laayaa
 Congress does not have time to think on this
 jeet mili to rahul kaa karishma he, bachaa-khuchaa sonia gandhi kaa
 The devotion was such that Manmohan, Gandhi were done and Siddaramaiah did it
 congress main mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar hai
 The strong leaders of the province are said to be
 jamini aankalan karne vaale bataate hai ki jeet main inkaa bada role rahaa
 But the flag of rahul-sonia's cheering does not become small, in this round the tongue slipped such that Manmohan Singh was made Manmohan Gandhi
 siddaramaiya ne kaha, 'thanks tu sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi, manmohan gandhi
 'karnataka hurt by political heat, hurt Congress due to corruption
 puri congress rahul ke gungan main lag gayi, lekin rahul pahunch gaye panchkula, party ke ek kaarykram main
 Leaving the Congress to live in the happiness that the victory of Karnataka will tie Rahul's heart across the country
 rahul kii jayakaar or modi par praharjit se bhi or prachaar ke aankadon se bhi, congress kaa har vyakti narendra modi ko chidhaa rahaa he
 Rahul Gandhi is seated on the Vijayrath of Karnataka
 karnataka main prachaar narendra modi ne bhi kiya tha, bijepi ne modi ko maidan main utaara tha
 But Rahul Gandhi gave such a challenge to Modi's propaganda that Modi's mission was ruined
 dilli or ahmedabad se bahut dur he bangalore
 But look amazing, the new mandate wires in Karnataka are directly connecting with Delhi and Ahmedabad
 ek jagah rahul gandhi hai or duusari jagah narendra modi
 Narendra Modi, riding on the chariot of Gujarat Vijay, did very little campaigning in Karnataka, but Sonia or Rahul was the target wherever he went
 kabhi-kabhaar manmohan singh
 But looking at the big plank, Rahul betted Modi in the race of Karnataka
 congress isi baat par modi ko khaarij kar rahi he
 Rahul Hit, Modi flop and Sonia 'dabba Band' If you look at the election campaign, Rahul Gandhi held 9 rallies in Karnataka elections, winning 8
 vahi narendra modi ne 4 siton par prachaar kiya, jisamen do main bijepi jiti or do main congress
 But the worst happened was Sonia's propaganda
 jin teen siton par congress kaa haath majboot karne gayi, un teenon par bijepi baaji maar le gai
 As the Congress got a majority on its own in the state, the Congress started ranting at Modi with Rahul and Sonia cheering
 bijepi haar ke bahaane dhund rahi hepiem pad ke liye ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan nahin hua to kya hua, bijepi ke netaa to modi ko apana sabase chamakdaar cheharaa maanate hai
 Now if the Congress is tainted with the same face, how will it be lost to the BJP
 lihaaja jawaab main congress ke puraani haaron kaa itihaas bijepi khangaalane lagi he
 Venkaiah Naidu says that if Sonia and Rahul lost in UP and Gujarat, are they not leaders? hamalaa parivaar par hua to rashtriya swayamsevak sangh bhi modi ke saath khadaa ho gaya
 MG Vaidya of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh said that Modi is famous
 bijepi kitni seat jitati he iskaa isse koi matlab nahin he
 Even BJP knew that Karnataka is not going to come in hand
 phir bhi haar hui to uski vajah talashne ke liye bijepi ne sansadeey board kii baithak bulaai
 But Modi did not come
