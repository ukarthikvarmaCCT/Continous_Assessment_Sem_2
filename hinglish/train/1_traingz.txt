vahi ram madhav do maheene baad bataa rahe hai ki gathbandhan chalane laayak nahin he
 After Mufti Sahab's death, Mehbooba Mufti took a long time to form an alliance, but she finally agreed
 kashmir main halaat bighad chuke hai yah sabko pataa he
 You will hear this from everyone's tongue
 bijepi ko bataanaa chahie ki jis gathbandhan ko wo aitihaasik avasar bataa rahi thi, uskaa itihaas teen saal hi kyon tikaa he
 On 1 March 2015, the Prime Minister's tweet was also brought out from the ruins of the same history where this coalition is now buried
 kashmir main rajyapal kaa shashan hoga
 The addition subtraction to be done by which party has the number is so much so that the screens of the channels are kept busy
 enen vohara kashmir chalaayenge
 Congress and NC have made it clear that they are not in this race
 na aapas main or na kisi or ke saath milakar sarkaar nahin banaaenge
 It is not right to say mismatched alliance, if it was mismatched, it would not have lasted for three years
 aisi baat nahin he ki is dauraan chunautiyaan nahin ain
 She was enough to break the alliance, but still the government continued
 tab bhi chali jab patharbazi charam par thi, halaat bekaabu ho chale the
 It used to run pictures on news channels day and night and opinion was made in Hindi states
 magar patharbazi ke drishy bataa rahe the ki halaat bekaabu hai
 The gap of mistrust is widening
 phir isi saal farvari 2018 main ek khabar chupake se aakar chali jaati he ki 2008 se 2017 ke bich 11,000 logon ke khilaaf patharbazi karne ke mukademe darj the, un sabase mukadmaa waapas liya jaataa he
 Thousands of people were arrested in the year 2016 when the stone pelting was at its peak
 isi 7 june 2018 ko grahamantri rajnath singh ne jammu kashmir sports kanklev main kaha tha ki bacchon ke khilaaf patharbazi karne ke jitne bhi cese kiye gaye the unhen waapas liya jayega
 This means that the Central and State Governments were proceeding thoughtfully together in the matter of withdrawing the case from the stone pelters
 yahi baat ram madhav bhi kah chuke hai
 You can also see an interview of Ram Madhav released from PTI on 30 April 2018 in which he says that for the first time the state government has given an apology by talking to the Home Ministry
 isi bich aapako yaad hoga ki ek major gogai seen main pravesh karte hai, apni jeep par ek faruk ahamed daar ko baandh kar dhaal bana lete hai
 The matter was also disputed and the bravery of the army and the strong intentions of the government were praised
 isi saal 23 may main major gogai ko ek hotel main kathith rup se naaballig ladki ke saath pakadaa jaataa he or inke khilaaf sena court aaf inquairi ke aadesh detii he
 From these two examples, you can see how the issues on which the political thinking of the Hindi territories was tried in a particular mold ends
 in tamaam chunautiyon ke bich ek chiz tiki rahi to wo pidipi bijepi kii sarkaar
 In the case of Kathua rape, this alliance remained intact, while two BJP ministers had to be removed at the behest of Mehbooba
 jo balaatkaar ke aaropee ke paksh main sabha kar rahe the
 If Mehbooba's bus would have gone on these two ministers, they would not have gone to the assembly in favor of the accused
 vahi mahabuuba chaahakar par shopiyaan maamle main major aditya kumaar kaa naam exiaar main nahin daal pain, jabaki ve twit kar magistrate jaanch ke aadesh de chuki thi
 Obviously both had to bend and both continued to walk together
 ram madhav ne bahut aasaani se mahabuuba ko gathbandhan kaa mukhya netritv qaraar de diya magar yah bhi bahes kaa mudda he ki mahabuuba ke haath main kitna netritv tha
 Sankarshan Thakur of Telegraph India, who knows Kashmir closely, has written in his article that there was a chief named Mehbooba
 ve bas kathputlati rah gayi hai
 His article is May 7, you can read
 mahabuuba ne bhi kaha ki ve sarkaar banane kaa prayaas nahin karengi
 But he did not criticize the BJP in his press conference
 itnaa hi kaha ki muscular policy yani baanh marodane vaali niti nahin chalegi
 Hearing the statements of both the parties, it seems that the same agreement was there to break the consensus
 koi khaas katutaa nazar nahin ai
 Nobody said that we got stabbed in our back
 balki itane bade faisle kaa elaan donon taraf se sanyam bhare shabdon ke saath hua
 Kashmir is not an unknown place for the Prime Minister
 tippaniyan Read all his speeches given in Kashmir after 2014, i read four to five speeches
 unamem kashmir kii niti kaa koi sanket nahin miltaa he, bas vikaas kii bate hai
 In his speeches in Kashmir, the Prime Minister never forgets to tell that he has been there as an activist, knows the area
 phir bhi apane bhaashanon main kabhi sidhe taur par kashmir kii mul samasya par bolte nahin suna
 In his speech, development has been talked about like tourism, use of solar energy, ring road, tunnel
 puraa bhaashan yojanaon ke shilanyas udghaatan or unke phaayde ko lekar hota tha
 In a speech, he talks about Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Kashmir policy
 atal ji kehete the ki insaniyar kashmiriyat or jamhuriyat ke teen majboot khambhon par jammu kashmir ko nai oonchaaiyon par le janaa he
 Then Prime Minister Modi also adds that within the dream of Vajpayeeji, we have filled the color of everyone's development with everyone
 ek bhaashan main ve mahabuuba mufti kii jamkar tarif karte hai ki kis tarah ve vikaas ko lekar utsahit hai
 Two people debate the situation in Kashmir
 ek jo kashmir ko kareeb se dekhte hai, lagaataar dekhte rahete hai, likhte rahete hai or duusare wo log hai jo kashmir par kuch jaanane kii zarurat nahin samajhate magar vidambnaa yah he ki kashmir ko lekar jo raajnneeti set hoti he us par isi duusare tabake kii raay sabase zyaada haaavee hoti he
 Kashmir will be ruled by the Governor
 kis party ke paas kitni sankhya he ise lekar kiya jane vaala jod ghataav itane bhar ke liye he taaki channelon ke screen ko vyast rakhaa jaae
 NN Vohra will run Kashmir
 congress or ensi ne saaf kar diya he ki ve is daud main nahin hai
 Neither shall we form a government with each other nor with anyone else
 bemail gathbandhan kahana thik nahin he, agar yah bemail hota to teen saal nahin chalata
 It is not that there were no challenges during this time
 wo kaaphi thim gathbandhan ke tut jane ke liye magar tab bhi sarkaar chalati rahi
 Even when the stone-pelting was at its peak, the situation had become uncontrollable
 din raat news channelon par isaki tasviren chalati thim or hindi pradeshon main raay banaai jaati thi
 But the stones were telling that the situation was uncontrollable
 avishvaas kii khai chaudee hoti ja rahi he
 Then in February this year, a news secretly comes out that between 2008 and 2017, 11,000 people were booked for stonewalling, most of them are withdrawn
 2016 ke saal main jab patharbaji charam par thi tab kai hazaar log giraftaar hue the
 On June 7, 2018, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in Jammu and Kashmir Sports Conclave that all the cases of stone pelting against children would be withdrawn
 iskaa matlab he ki patharbazon se mukadmaa waapas lene ke maamle main centre or rajya sarkaar ek saath soch samaj kar aage bad rahe the
 Ram Madhav has also said the same thing
 30 april 2018 ko pitiai se jari ram madhav kaa ek intervyuu bhi aap dekh sakate hai jisamen ve kehete hai ki pehali baar pathar phenkane waalon rajya sarkaar ne grahamantralay se baat kar maafee di he
 Meanwhile, you will remember that a Major Gogai enters the scene, tying a Farooq Ahmed Dar on his jeep and making a shield
 yah maamla bhi kaaphi vivaadit hui or sena kii bahaduree or sarkaar ke majboot iraadon kii tarif kii gai
 On May 23 this year, Major Gogai is allegedly caught with a minor girl in a hotel and the army orders a court of inquiry against them
 in do udaahranon se dekh sakate hai ki jin muddon ko lekar hindi pradeshon kii raajnneetik soch ko ek khaas saanche main dhaalane kii koshish kii gai unka ant kis tarah se hota he
 One thing remained in the midst of all these challenges, that PDP BJP government
 kathua balaatkaar ke maamle main bhi yah gathbandhan tikaa rahaa, jabaki mahabuuba ke kehane par bijepi ke do matriyon ko hataanaa padaa tha
 Who were gathering in favor of the rape accused
 agar in do mantriyon par mahabuuba kaa bas chalata to ye aaropee ke paksh main sabha main jate hi nahin
 On the same Mehbooba Chakar could not put the name of Major Aditya Kumar in the FIR in Shopian case, while she had tweeted and ordered a magistrate inquiry
 zaahir he donon ko hi jhukna padaa or donon saath bhi chalate rahe
 Ram Madhav very easily described Mehbooba as the main leadership of the coalition but it is also a matter of debate how much leadership was in Mehbooba's hands
 kashmir ko kareeb se jaanane vaale telegraph india ke sankarshan thakur ne apane lekh main likhaa he ki mahabuuba naam kii mukhiya thim
 They are just puppets
 7 may kaa unka lekh hai aap pard sakate hai
 Mehbooba also said that she would not try to form a government
 magar unhone apane press conference main bijepi kii aalochana nahin kii
 This much said that the muscular policy i
e
 arm twisting policy will not work
 donon pakshon ke bayaan ko sun kar lagata he ki gathbandhan banane main jaisi sahmati thi, waisi hi sahmati tuutane ko lekar bhi he
 There was no significant bitterness
 kisi ne nahin kaha ki hamaari peeth main chura bhonka gaya he
 Rather, such a big decision was announced with restrained words from both sides
 pradhanmantri ke liye kashmir koi anjaan jagah nahin he
 The comments 2014 ke baad kashmir main die gaye unke sabhi bhaashanon ko padhie, main chaar paanch bhaashan padhe
 There is no indication of Kashmir's policy in them, but only about development
 kashmir main apane bhaashanon main pradhanmantri kabhi bataanaa nahin bhoolatey ki vahaan kaaryakarta ke rup main rahe hai, ilaake ko jaanate hai
 Yet in his speeches he was never directly heard speaking on the root problem of Kashmir
 unke har bhaashan main vikaas paryaton, saura urja kaa istamaal, ring road, tunnel jaisi bate hai
 The entire speech was about the inauguration of the schemes and their benefits
 ek bhaashan main ve atal bihari vaajapeyi kii kashmir niti ki baat karte hai
 Atal ji used to say that Jammu and Kashmir has to be taken to new heights on the three strong pillars of human Kashmiri and Jamhooriyat
 phir pradhanmantri modi yah bhi jod dete hai ki hamane vaajapeyi ji sapane ke andar sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas kaa rang bhar diya he
 In a speech, he praises Mehbooba Mufti for how excited he is about development
 kashmir ke halaat par do log bahes karte hai
 One who closely observes Kashmir, constantly observes, keeps writing, and the other is those who do not understand the need to know anything about Kashmir, but the irony is that the politics set about Kashmir is based on this other section Opinion dominates the most

 The SIT constituted by the Supreme Court on Monday alleged that Zakia Jafri's petition was filed for dismissal of its report giving clean chit to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and others in the rioting cases raging after the 2002 Godhra incident
 Is an attempt to gain favorable order by 'confusing'
 esaiti ke vakil aar es jamuaar ne court ko bataaya, ‘is yachika main, 75 fisadi saamagree esaiti dwaara kii gayi jaanch ke sambandh main praasangik hi nahin he
 It is nothing but an attempt to get orders in his favor by creating confusion in the mind of the court

 In support of his argument for Jafri's filing of mostly irrelevant material, Jamuar collected the 2002 Dipda Darwaza riot case, VHP leader Acharya Giriraj Kishore's speech in September 2002, Modi's speech in the assembly and alerts collected between February and July 2002
 Mentioned the messages
 vishesh jaanch dal ne pichley saal janvari main apni antim report saunpi thi jisamen modi tathaa anya ko clin chit di gayi thi
 Jafri has filed a petition before the magistrate, opposing the SIT report and has filed a charge sheet against Modi and 58 others

 Mehbooba tweeted, 'hurriyat leaders and Jamaat Sangatan activists have been arrested in the last 24 hours
 is tarah kii manamaani karrwai ko samaj nahin paa rahi hum, isse jammu kashmir main keval halaat jatil hi honge
 On what legal grounds can his arrest be justified? You can keep a person in custody but not their views
 'vahiin, udaaravaadi hurriyat conference ke adhyaksh mirwij umr farukh ne jexlef pramukh yaccin malik ko hiraasat main lene or jamaat-e-islamic jammu and kashmir ke netaaon par chhapemari kii ninda kii

 ' After the first two rounds of voting, the grand alliance started preparing for the swearing-in ceremony of Nitish Kumar, claiming victory
 unhone maan liya he ki bijepi in do charnon main itani buree tarah pichad gai he ki baaki ke teen charnon main wo chaahe kitni hi mehnat kar le, barabari to dur, sammanjanak haar se bhi dur he
 Many political analysts also seem to agree with this assessment, but is the ground reality really that way? pehle do charnon main mahagathbandhan kii ajey badhat ke daavon ke peeche kai kaaran ginaae ja rahe hai
 Yadav did not break into votes, Nitish and Lalu's votes were transferred to each other, Kushwaha votes were not received outright to NDA, Mohan Bhagwat's statement on reservation divided the EBC and Dalit votes badly, bjp's internal dissatisfaction increased , Bihari vs outsider issue forced BJP to change its hoardings and had to put pictures of local leaders and PM Modi's Sol in view of possible defeat Had to cancel three rallies October

 The monsoon session of Parliament starts on Wednesday 18 July, and this time everyone will be eyeing the election for the Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 congress or bijepi donon hi is pad par apane ummidavaar ko dekhnaa chaahati hai, lekin siton kaa ganit aisa he ki inamen se koi bhi apane dam par kisi ummidavaar ko jitaane main sakasham nahin he
 In such a situation, the allies of these big parties in NDA and UPA have also set their eyes on this post
 ab tak badi partiyon ne bhi is maamle main bada dil dikhaane kaa sanket diya he
 It is reported that Congress may offer this post to NCP i
e
 Nationalist Congress Party
 pad kii res main encipirajyasabha ke upasabhapatipije courian kaa kaarykaal 1 july ko khatm ho gaya or mahaj chand dinon main monsoon satr shuru hone vaala he
 Therefore, the game of political multiplication has started with regard to the new Deputy Chairman
 congress kii taraf se sanket mil rahe hai ki vah apana ummidavaar to nahin utaaregi, par ensipi ko upasabhapati ke pad kaa prastaav de sakati he
 This proposal can be discussed in the strategic meeting of the opposition parties
 darasalcongressdikhanaa chaahati he ki uskaa 'dil bada' he
 It is necessary for him to keep the opposition united till the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, so the party wants that he should offer the post of Deputy Chairman to any allies and NCP seems to be most comfortable in this
 gauratlab he ki ensipi congress kii puraani sahyogi he
 Both have run the government at the Center and Maharashtra together
 2014 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main donon partiyaan alag-alag chunaav ladiin, jiskaa nateeja ye hua ki unke haath se satta chali gai
 In the last Lok Sabha election, NCP was successful in winning more seats than Congress by contesting less seats
 congress 27 siton par ladakar sirf do siten jeet saki, jabaki ensipi 21 siten ladakar chaar siten jeetne main safal rahi
 However, there is another reason behind the Congress giving NCP the seat of Deputy Chairman
 bataaya jaataa he ki upie ke uske sahyogi va anya kshetreey dalon ne usase saaf kah diya he ki ve congress ko jitaane ke liye nahin balki bijepi ko haraane ke liye ek manch par aana chaahate hai
 Challenges for Congress: Congress has limited options
 yaa to wo mamata banerjee kii tiemasi ko is maamle main saport kare jinka congress ke saath kaam karne ko lekar koi acha record nahin rahaa he
 She had withdrawn support from the UPA-2 government in between
 saath hi pashchim bengal main vidhansabha chunaav main bhi congress banerjee kii bajaay unki virdohi left partiyon kii sahyogi rahi thi
 Mamata herself is still swinging between the Grand Alliance or the Federal Front and even though Rahul Gandhi is the PM candidate, her stand is still not clear
 aise main congress ko doosraa vikalp zyada mufeed lag rahaa he jiske tahat ensipi jaise apekshaakrit zyada vafaadaar dal ko upasabhapati pad ofer karnaa he
 According to the Hindustan Times report, an NCP leader has admitted that the Congress has informally spoken to the party in this regard
 lekin abhi is silsile main kuch thos prastaav saamne nahin aayaa he
 This leader said that his party wants to act as a bridge between Congress and other opposition parties
 'congress trinmul congress ke ummidavaar ke bajaay hamaare saath zyada sahaj mahasoos karegi, anya choti partiyaan bhi congress kii tulana main ensipi se zyada sahaj rahengi
 'let us know that the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad will preside over the meeting of opposition parties to be held on Monday
 isamen monsoon satr ko lekar vipaksh kii ranneeti taiyaar kii jaaegi
 In the meeting, the TDP may also take a decision regarding the support of the no-confidence motion against the Modi government

 Shankaracharya Jagadguru Swami Jayendra Saraswati of Kanchi Kamakoti Peeth slept in Chiranidra on Wednesday
 83 varshiya jayendra saraswati ek samay ayodhya maamle ke hal ke liye kaaphi sakriy the, or unka daawa tha ki is masale kaa hal nikaalane ke kaaphi kareeb pahunch gaye the
 It is believed that during the previous NDA government, Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati had the support of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 is sambandh main swayan jayendra saraswati ne saal 2010 main ye daawa kiya tha ki vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali tatkaaleen rajg sarkaar ayodhya vivaad ke samaadhaan ke bilkul kareeb pahunch gai thi or is uddeshy se ek kanoon bhi banane vaali thi
 However, it is a coincidence that Shree Ravi Shankar, the head of Ort of Living, is currently trying for an out-of-court settlement in the bjp-led NDA government to resolve the Ayodhya case
 jayendra saraswati ne 2010 main daawa kiya tha ki muslim personal lau board, sunni central vakf board or hindu sanghathanon ke pratinidhiyon se samuchit salaah-mashvire ke baad tatkaaleen vaajapeyi sarkaar ne varsh 2002 main kanoon banaakar ayodhya vivaad ke samaadhaan kaa rasta nikaal liya tha
 According to Shankaracharya, Vajpayee had also met the President in this regard and the law was cleared in Parliament to make a statement to solve the problem
 yah bataate hue ki ayodhya vivaad ke hal main tatkaaleen kendriya mantri jorge furnandis ne bahut mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Shankaracharya Jayendra Saraswati had a central role in efforts to resolve the Ayodhya dispute by negotiating between the two sides during the tenure of the Raja government during the tenure of the Raja government
 jayendra saraswati ne ummid jataai thi ki chah july 2003 tak ayodhya mudde kaa hal nishchit rup se nikaal liya jayega
 Syed Rabe Hasan Nadvi, the then chairman of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, admitted that he had received a letter from Shankaracharya, offering some suggestions to resolve the Ayodhya dispute
 haalanki ye suzav kabhi saarvajanik rup se saamne nahin aae
 Why Shankaracharya's attempt failed, however, because it failed because a suit was filed in the Supreme Court over the Ayodhya dispute 15 days before it was implemented
 ’shankaracharya jivan bhar yah daawa karte rahe ki unke paas ayodhya vivaad ke samaadhaan kaa aisa formula he jo sabhi pakshon ko maanya hoga
 However he never disclosed it
 unka kahana tha ki yadi samay se pehle ise saarvajanik kar diya gaya to samaadhaan ke raste main rukaawatein aa sakati hai
 Ayodhya case hearing to be held from March 14, tell us that the Supreme Court is going to hear the Ayodhya case from March 14
 shrishri ravishankar court ke baahar samjhaute kii koshish kar rahe hai
 However, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board and other parties say that the matter is in court and only the verdict of the court will be valid
 baavjood iske muslim personal lau board ke sadsy rahe moulana nadvi, shiya vakf board ke chif wasim rizvi jaise log court ke baahar samjhaute ke liye prayaas kar rahe hai
 Legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar said that Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his players have embarrassed the country by their poor performance in the Test series against England
 mahaan ballebaaj ne saath hi suzav bhi diya ki jo khilaadi cricket ke lambey praaroop main khilne main dilchaspee nahin rakhte unhen test team chhod deni chahie
 India suffered an innings and 244 runs defeat in the fifth and final Test yesterday
 gavaskar ne kaha, agar aap bharat ke liye test cricket nahin khelnaa chaahate to ise chhod do
 Only play limited overs cricket
 aapako is tarah desh ko sharmasaar nahin karnaa chahie
 He, however, said that England should be cautious in future series as the win is against the Indian team, which does not play tough cricket
 unhone kaha, england kii har cheez sheersh stareey rahi
 But India resisted the 'jelly kind'
 isliye england ko is jeet ke baad atmamugdh nahin hona chahie kyonki unke liye isse bhi kadi pariksha aane vaali hai
 In the same program, former England captain Michael Vann questioned the commitment of the Indian players
 unhone kaha, yah sochna sharmnaak he ki bhartiya team keval 29 over main hi simat gai, jabaki pich acha kar rahi thi

 In December 2012, Ronald dubretrand, an emissary of religious affairs in the French Foreign Ministry, visited India and held discussions with Minister of State for External Affairs Praneet Kaur
 tippaniyan Sikhs are not prohibited from wearing turbans in the streets and private schools in France, but there is a ban on displaying any kind of religious symbol, including a turban and even a cross sign in government schools

 The American company IBM has said that it will continue to invest in India and employ people
 usne kaha he ki bharat main company ke paas 3,000 se bhi zyada riktiyaan hai jinhen bharaa jayega
 An economic paper has reported this
 patr ke mutabik vaise to company senior level par logon ko hataa rahi he lekin anya staron par niyuktiyaan karegi
 Due to increasing expenses and salary, the company has started removing people from senior positions
 IBM ne das saal pehle bharat main kadam rakhaa tha
 After that this huge company restored large scale people in India
 2011 main company ke paas 1
 There were 65 lakh employees
 lekin company badhate kharch se pareshaan he or usamen katautee kar rahi he
 For this reason people are being removed from senior positions
 lekin company kam selary vaale logon kii bahaali kar rahi he
 The company is headquartered in Bangalore, India, and also holds the position of Managing Director, which is being said that the company wants to eliminate it to reduce costs
 desh main pehali baar kisi dharmaguru ne film banane kii jurrat kii he
 The term 'jurrat' has been used because our country is believed to be singing or rock concerts to religious leaders
 aisa nahin he ki desh main rock concert yaa filmein relies nahin hotin
 All happens, but if the religious leaders do, then it is bound to be disputed, because the religious leaders or 'god Man' of all the citizens, say, there is not one
 har ghar main parpanra or aasthaa ke hisaab se guru kii manyata he bhi or nahin bhi
 Now because of this, it is obvious that any religious person promoting his film in the whole country will not like those who do not believe in him
 yahaan baat ho rahi he 'deraa sachcha sauda' ke pramukh gurmeet ram rahim kii, jinaki film 'MSG- da massenger of god' 16 janvari ko relies honi thi, lekinsensor board ne is film par roak laga di
 The Censor Board says that in this film, the Dera chief has declared himself to be God
 haalanki ki deraa pramukh kai baar intervyuu main is baat ko nakaarte aae hai
 He says that he has portrayed himself as an angel of God in the film and not as a god
 is film ke trailor main bhidera pramukh ko ek dialogbolate hue dikhaaya gaya he
 The dialogue is- 'those who get done are alla, wahe guru, god, ram, we are just a human being
 ' khayr is film par roak lagaae jane kii vajah kuch bhi ho, lekin is film ko relies kiya janaa chahie
 Many reasons for this are constantly being updated on social sites
 film kyon relies honi chahie, ye hai uski paanch vajahen:1
 The biggest motive for making this film is being told to help people suffering from Thalassemia in the country
 film se hone vaali kamai se un garib logon kii sahaayta karnaa jo is beemaari kaa kharch uthaane main asamarth he
 2
 deraa pramukh dwaara is film ke bare die gaye intervyuu main kai baar is baat kaa zikr kiya he ki unki yah film yangsters ke liye dedicket he
 They believe that the younger generation of the country is involved in drugs and various types of drugs
 isse unhen baahar nikaalane ke liye or un tak yah sandesh pahunchane ke liye vahi rasta apnaanaa hoga, jis par vah amal kar saken, kyonki yangsters kii dilchaspee 3 ghante ke satsang se zyada 3 ghante kii film dekhne main hoti he
 Hence this film has been chosen as a medium
 deraa chif ko ummid he ki yangsters par film kaa asar jarur hoga or vah drugs jaisi chizon se dur rahenge
 3
 is film ko bollywood diarector jitu arodane prodeus kiya he
 a statement by Bollywood director Mahesh Bhatt has also been released on the film's halt
 mahesh bhatta ne ek hindi akhbaar ko die gaye intervyuu main kaha he ki is film ko nyaay jarur milegaa
 Why do people in the film industry stand up with flags for creative freedom and freedom of expression, why are they silent on the release of 'messenger of God'? He said that the person who fights for the freedom of 'PK' and 'haider' has a duty to fight for a film like 'MSG' too
 yah sahi nahin he ki aap chun-chunakar filmon ke liye khadey hon
 He said, 'even if you don't agree with the person who made the film, he has the right to show his film
 agar ham kahen ki hamaari kahi baat kamaal kii he or duusare kii baat thik nahin to yah doglaapan he
 '4
 is film ke fasebuk pej par yah bataaya gaya he ki film main kareeb 15 maanavtaa or bhalaai ke kaaryon ko karne kaa sandesh diya gaya he
 This will inspire people to pursue the path of humanity
 5
 On Twitter, this hashtag # isupportmsg continues to be in the top trend regarding this film
 is isupportmsg naam ke twitor pej par film ko relies kiya janaa chahie or kyon isaki tamaam vajah bataayin ja rahi hai
 One of these reasons has been given - 'because it is an anti-drug film, the censor board is afraid of drug mafia
 ' # releaseourmsg # isupportmsg@narendramodiwhy censor board trying 2 ban anti drug movie? Fearing drug mafia?"— ekuinsa # isupportmsg (@ektainsan)january 15, 2015 # isupportmsg@pmoindia@narendramodimsg is a movie which is against the alcohal and drugs, it gives gud lesson to youth
 must release

 videsh mantri salmaan khurshid ne kaha ki mulaakaat ke sambandh main antim nirnay pradhanmantri lenge
 Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh said, the Prime Minister's program is in the process of being finalized
 unke mutabik vah nahin bataa saktin ki mulaakaat hogi yaa nahin
 The reporters had asked Sujatha whether the two Prime Ministers would meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month
 manmohan singh 25 sitambar ko america ke liye ravaanaa honge or 27 se 30 sitambar tak neuyork main rahenge
 Khurshid told PTI, "we are worried about many things, which we have told Pakistan in the recent past
" hamen santosh milanaa chahie
 We want some work done
 ham is baat ke sanket chaahate hai ki hamane unhen jo bataaya he, un par gambhirtha he
 The comments videsh mantri se jab poocha gaya ki kya manmohan or sharif mulaakaat karenge, to unhone kaha, aatanki dhaanche ko nestanabood karnaa ek ahm bindu he
 Accountability is also another important point for what happened in Mumbai (on 26 November 2008)
 kam se kam kuch shuruyaat honi chahie
 When it was mentioned in front of Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh that Sharif had recently given positive statements, he quoted the Prime Minister as saying that there are some harsh ground realities right now
 sujatha ne kaha, katu jamini vaastaviktaa se aashay he ki ham pakistan se gatividhiyaan chalaa rahe sanghathanon kii ore se or pakistan ke niyantran vaale kshetron se aatankwaadi gatividhiyon kaa lagaataar saamana kar rahe hai
 He said, many people are also involved in anti-propaganda against India, who roam freely in Pakistan
 pakistan main sarvocch str se baar-baar patibaddhtaon or bahut sakaaratmak bayanon ke baavjood mumbai hamalon ke liye jimmedaar logon ko dandit karne ke prayaason main bahut kam pragati hui he
 This is a harsh truth
 dekhte hai kya hota he
 Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid said that the Prime Minister will take the final decision regarding the meeting
 videsh sachiv sujatha singh ne kaha, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykram abhi antim rup die jane kii prakriya main he
 According to her, she could not tell whether the meeting would take place or not
 samvaadadaataaon ne sujatha se poocha tha ki kya donon pradhanmantri is maheene ke aakhir main neuyork main sanyukt raashtra mahasabha se itar mulaakaat karenge
 Manmohan Singh will leave for the US on 25 September and will stay in New York from 27 to 30 September
 khurshid ne pitiai se kaha, ham kai chizon ko lekar chintit hai, jo hamane pichley kuch samay main pakistan ko bataa di hai
 We should get satisfaction
 ham chaahate hai ki kuch kaam ho
 We want indications that what we have told them is serious
 tippaniyan When the Foreign Minister was asked if Manmohan and Sharif would meet, he said, "it is an important point to destroy the terror structure
" mumbai main (26 november, 2008 ko) jo hua, uske liye javabdehi bhi ek anya mahatvapurn bindu he
 There should be at least some beginning
 jab videsh sachiv sujatha singh ke saamne is baat kaa zikr kiya gaya ki sharif ne haal hi main sakaaratmak bayaan die hai, to unhone pradhanmantri ke hawaale se kaha ki abhi kuch katu jamini vaastaviktaaen hai
 Sujatha said, "the harsh ground reality means that we are constantly facing terrorist activities on behalf of organizations operating from Pakistan and from areas controlled by Pakistan
" unhone kaha, kai log bharat ke khilaaf virdohi dushprachaar main bhi shaamil hai, jo pakistan main khuleam ghoomte rahete hai
 Despite repeated commitments and very positive statements from the highest level in Pakistan, there has been little progress in efforts to punish those responsible for the Mumbai attacks
 yah katu sachai hai
 Let's see what happens
 manmohan singh 25 sitambar ko america ke liye ravaanaa honge or 27 se 30 sitambar tak neuyork main rahenge

 input bhashaa se Today i want to talk about the technology that will not only bring change in India, but it will transform it
 takanic saikadon saal se maanav sabhyataa kii tarakkee ko disha detii rahi he
 But what is technology after all? These are the tools and methods that humans invented using a scientific temper to do things better
 technology utpaadakta badhaane, oonche moolyavardhan main or aarthik vikaas par maharath hasil karne main madad detii he or ye sab milakar samaaj ko sampann or shashakt banane main yogadan dete hai
 Every technological revolution reinvigorates the rules of the game
 jo usamen pahal kar lete hai unke haath vaishvik netritv, takat or rasookh paane kaa mauka lag jaataa he
 The world has seen many technological revolutions, but in most of all India has been marginalized
 khaskar dhanchaagat or menuphaccharing ke kshetra main to hamane aage jane ke kai avasar ganvaa die
 Today the world is at the cusp of another industrial revolution — when the confluence of physical, digital and biological sciences is taking place
 isse maanavtaa ko jivan ke sabhi pahaluon par phir se nigaah daalane, unamem nai khoj karne or unhen nayaa rup dene main madad milegi
 Mobile Internet, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, nano-technology and genomics are the basic technologies of this revolution
 arabon log or sensor har pal data kii ek sunami lekar aate hai, jinhen cloud main taqatvar software or gananaaon (alogridam) ke jariye samajha ja saktaa he or phir unase upabhoktaaon ke liye jaadui anubhav ijad kiye ja sakate hai, samaaj kii jatiltam samasyaon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he or moolyavardhan ke nae raaston ko apanaaya ja saktaa he
 In the coming 20 years, human civilization will achieve more than what we have achieved in three hundred years by using unique technologies
 ham inasaaniyat ke nae daur kii bhor main hai or yah ek aisa mauka he jo bharat ko khule haathon se sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 The funniest thing about young Bharatotechnology is that it equals everyone, it does not believe in any caste, creed or religion
 meraa mat he ki bharat is nai kranti main agrani bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 i have four reasons for this
 pehla, bharat ek yuva raashtra he or uski aabaadi kaa 63 fisadi hissaa 35 saal kii umr se kam he
 In Jio, i have seen how fast young people are adopting technology
 saal 2014 main bharat broadband mobile kii pahunch main duniya main 154wein sthaan par tha or 2029 tak vah duniya ke sheersh teen deshon main ek hoga
 Secondly, till now the absence of digital and the historical technology structure is also like sneaking out of the cat
 paaramparik technology aadhaar na hone kaa aashay yah he ki ham technology kii kai peedhishon ko darkinar karte hue sidhe agali peedi ko apana sakate hai or ek jatke main duniya ke zyaadaatar unnat deshon se bhi aage nikal sakate hai
 Thirdly, India is on the path of connecting all its citizens with the global Internet
 saal 2017 ke aakhir tak jeeyo kaa network lagbhag sabhi shaharon, kasbon va gaanvon main hoga or desh kii 99 fisadi aabaadi tak uski pahunch hogi
 We have the nervous system to deliver its digital oxygen ie data to every citizen
 chauthe, bharat ek vishaal or khulaa bazaar he
 Unlike other big economies that are busy building walls, we are fortunate that we have a leadership that wants to connect the country with the world
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii digital india kii pariklpana digital hive, i-gavarnence, i-ajukeshan, i-healthcare or desh ke kisaanon ko vaishvik bazaaron se digitaly jodgaye kii baat karti he
 This has created a digital operating system for India
 haalanki is kaam main chunautiyaan bhi hai
 The first is 1 every year
 5 karod nae rojgaar srujit karnaa
 India has only three crore jobs in the organized sector but 44 crore jobs in the unorganized sector
 varsh 2005-12 kii avadhi main naukariyon main vruddhi kaa 70 fisadi chote or majhole udhyamon se aayaa
 Technology has a big role in it
 jeeyo kii pahal ke jariye hamane 90,000 pratyaksh naukariyaan srujit kii hai lekin isse bhi zyada jaruri baat yah he ki hamane pichley dhai saal main vyapak jeeyo tantra ke jariye 50,000 tikaoo naukariyaan srujit kii hai
 The second challenge is financial inclusion
 aane vaale varshon main aapaki aadhaar pahchaan or aapke profile ke vrihad data vishleshan kii madad se aapke liye minuton main apane mobile par karj hasil kar lenaa sambhav ho jayega
 Third is education India can provide high quality digital education in schools, colleges and universities of the country to overcome the challenges
 jeeyo desh ke sabhi 58,000 collejon main broadband connactivity uplabdh kara rahaa he or uskaa lakshya deshbhar main 19 lakh skulon ko jod dena he
 Another opportunity is to provide a home for a lower price
 aaj, nae saamaan, 3di nirmaan takanic or modular nirmaan paddatiyon se hamaare paas kam laagat vaale smart ghar banane kii gunjaaish he
 Healthcare is another area in which India can become a world leader with the help of digital technology
 krishi main bharat praudyogikiyon ko apnaane, jal sangrakshan, bhu-prabandhan, nappi-tuli kheti vagairah ko protsaahan dekar, gramin ilaakon main sampada, nayaa gyaan, jeevanyaapan ke avasar srujit kar saktaa he
 If you combine the tools of technology with instant information, then another green revolution - a digital green revolution - is possible
 data kii hifaazatjaise-jaise ham digital yug main pravesh kar rahe hai, hamen is baat ko yaad rakhana chahie ki soochna ek takat he or koi bhi soochna digital swaroop main naganya si laagat par palak jhapakate duniyabar main pahunch sakati he
 If India and Indians want to take advantage of India's technology revolution, then we have to decide that whatever data is being generated in India should remain within the Indian border and not go out
 praudyogiki kaa makasad samaaj kii ansulajhi samasyaon ko suljhaana or sadak par nikle har vyakti ko samaan avasar uplabdh karana he
 We really have to combine our cleverness with global technology, it is a unique match
 tees saal ke bheetar bharat apni aazaadee ke sau saal manayega
 In these thirty years we have to aim to increase our economy from $ 25 trillion to $ 400 trillion and we can do so
 aaj kaa bharat romaanchak or chunauteepurn he, lekin kal kaa bharat santushtidaayak hoga

 # Jignesh was ill, so there was a delay in going to the meeting place
 # jahaan sabha he vahaan par bheed thi, isliye police bal kaaphi sankhya main tainaat he

 # ambedkar park par jignesh ke aane kii sambhaavna thi, jaise hi police ko pataa chalaa ye ambedkar park aaenge

 dilli gangrape ke baad banaai gai justise verma kamity ne apni report saunp di he

 dilli gangrape ko lekar unhone grih sachiv or dilli police kii bhi khinchaai kii he
 Just a day before the 30-day period was over, the Justice JS Verma Committee submitted its report to the Ministry of Home Affairs

 But Justice Verma Committee has not suggested punishment-a-death
 justise verma kamity ne suzav die hai ki dhara 376 (1), 376 (2) or 376 (3) ke tahat doshi ko taumr jail main rakhaa jaae
 Section 376 (C) means that in case of gangrape, the guilty should be kept in jail
 kamity ne nai dhara 376 (f) ko jodne kii sifarish kii he jiske tahat yon aparaadhon ke maamle main prashasnic yaa sena ke adhikari kii jimmedaari bhi tay hogi
 The committee has recommended the provision of punishment under sections 375, 376 and 509 from 7 to 20 years
 lekin justise verma kamity ne sajaa-e-maut kaa suzav nahin diya he
 There was a lot of controversy over the question of what should be the age of a minor after the Delhi gang rape case, but Justice Verma Committee has not recommended any change in the age of the minor

 He said that 8 xxrep 4 0 suggestions were received from abroad, due to change in law, but hardly any police chief sent the suggestion
 sarkari vibhaagon se bhi kam suzav mili
 Justice Verma suggested to the government that the investigative agencies needed to be freed from government clutches
 dilli gangrape cese ko lekar justise verma ne dilli police or par oongli uthaai he
 He said that he was surprised that when it was time to apologize, the Home Secretary was patting the Delhi Police Commissioner on the back
 samiti ne sifarish kii he ki kisi vyakti ko jaanboojh kar choona or vah choona yon prakruti kaa ho or jise chuaa ja rahaa he, uski sahmati ke viruddh ho to kanoon main use yon hinsa mana janaa chahie
 The committee has proposed punishment for various criminal acts including threatening words or gestures, stalking a girl, stalking human trafficking and sexual desire
 kisi mahila ko nirvastr karne ke iraade se us par hamalaa karne kii sthiti main teen se saat saal kii sajaa kaa prastaav samiti ne kiya he
 The committee has recommended a stringent punishment for police officers who do not register a case of rape or sexual harassment after a complaint
 balaatkaar karne vaale maatahaton ko niyantrit karne main vifal rahane vaale sainya yaa police adhikariyon ke liye das saal kii sajaa kaa prastaav samiti ne kiya he

 Also said that top police officers should be made accountable for not complying with the laws
 saath hi adhik street liten lagane jaise achche shashan ke suzav bhi de daale
 Taking a dig at the khap panchayats, the committee said that the approach that khap panchayats adopt has reached an irrational level
 samiti ne sarkaar se kaha ki vah sunishchit kare ki shaadi ke maamle main logon dwaara chune gayi vikalp ko lekar is tarah kii sansthaaen hastkshep na karen
 The committee said that it was relevant to consider the stand of Khap panchayats in the context of crime against women
 verma ne kaha ki khap panchayaton dwaara jati vyavastha banaaye rakhane kaa tark kisi vyakti ke swatantra rup se apana saathi chunane kii aazaadee chhinta he
 Verma said that we expect the government to ensure that institutions like Khap Panchayats do not interfere in the choice of a man or woman in the matter of marriage
 samiti ne kaha ki juthi shaan ke liye hatya kaa shikaar bade paimaane par mahilaayein ban rahi hai
 It was thus important for the committee to consider this social evil
 justise verma cameti ko ummid he ki jitne kam dinon main unhone sarkaar ko suzav dene kaa kaam kiya he sarkaar bhi utane hi kam dinon main un sujhaavon par faisla legi or unhen lagu karegi

 1
 Develop Leadership Ability in Yourself Unfortunately, political life has become so infamous that good people are scared of coming into it
 desh tabhi samrudh hoga jab raajnneeti main har varg ke, har kshetra ke achche log aaenge
 You should develop leadership in yourself and get into politics
 2
 It is not possible to become a leader or a soldier only to serve the country
 sirf netaa yaa faujee bananaa desh kii seva nahin he
 Always keep in mind that you are not harming the country by any work
 agar aap apane ghar main kaam karne vaali mahila ko kuch vakt nikaalkar padhaate hai to vah bhi desh kii seva he
 Saving electricity and saving food is also a service to the country
 3
 Know yourself first and then decide to do something
 Know yourself first and then do the work that you want to do
 tab aapako zyada anand aayega
 4
 khud ko khulaa chhod densirf degree or naukari ke daayre main na rakhen
 Leave yourself open
 agar aapako kavita likhane kaa shauk hai to kavita likhen
 The fire will get so much satisfaction that you will not get satisfaction from anything else
 5

 The price of onion reaches near Rs 80 per kg
 The central government is showing promptness this time, due to the inward interest of onion imports from many countries, its price has again reached near Rs 80 per kg
 haalanki, sarkaar is baar mustaid dikh rahi he
 The Ministry of Consumer Affairs has said that the government will encourage onion imports from other countries, so that its prices will come down
 upabhokta maamalon ke mantralay ke anusaar, yah faisla liya gaya he ki pyaaj ke aayaat ko badhaava diya jaae
 This decision was taken in the inter-ministerial committee meeting held on Tuesday
 samiti ne pyaaj kii uplabdhta or keemton kii phir se samiksha kii
 Which countries will the onions come from? Indian missions in Afghanistan, Egypt, Turkey and Iran have been asked to supply onions to India
 ummid kii ja rahi he ki jald hi 80 se 100 contenron main pyaaj bharat pahonchegi
 The decision to import onion indicates that its domestic availability is not sufficient
 sarkaar maharashtra evam anya dakshini rajyon se uttar bharat main pyaaj kii aapurti kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Significantly, due to the unseasonal rains and inward diminution, the price of interest has once again skyrocketed
 kuch din pehle tak 50 rupee kilo bikne vaala pyaaj aaj 80 rupee kilo bik rahaa he
 The price on Monday was Rs 70 a kg
 aane vaale samay main pyaaj ke daam main or badhotaree kii sambhaavna he
 Why are the prices of onion increasing? The farmers say that the price is increasing due to the shortage of onion in the market
 aane vaale 10-15 dinon tak raahat milane kii ummid nahin he
 Due to the protests by the farmers, there is a lot of bottleneck in the supply of onions and tomatoes in the mandis
 is vajah se pyaaj or tamaato ke daamon main ijapha ho gaya he
 When onion goes from the wholesale market to the retail market, its price goes up to Rs 60 to 70 per kg
 vahiin tamaato retail market main in dinon 70 se 80 rupee prati kilogram bik rahaa he
 Recently, to keep the price of onions and pulses under control, the central government had directed NAFED to continue supplying pulses and onions from the buffer stock
 centre sarkaar teen talaak par pratibandh lagane ke liye sansad main bill lekar aegi
 Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad gave this information
 pichley maheene 16veen loksabhaa bhang hone ke baad teen talaak par pratibandh kaa bill gir gaya he
 Again this bill cannot be passed without bringing in Parliament, so the government will move forward on this process
 pichhali baar yah vivaadit bill loksabhaa main to paarit ho gaya tha lekin rajyasabha main lambit tha
 Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other mps have sworn in as ministers for the 17th Lok Sabha
 17 june se sansad kaa satr bhi shuru ho rahaa he jisamen yah bill laayaa jayega
 According to the rules, the bills which are introduced in the Rajya Sabha but are pending there, do not end despite the dissolution of the Lok Sabha
 haalanki jo bill loksabhaa main paarit ho jate hai lekin rajyasabha main lambit hote hai, wo loksabhaa bhang hote hi gir jate hai
 The opposition has been opposing the triple talaq bill in the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha main vipaksh majboot he kyonki satta paksh ke sadasyon kii sankhya yahaan kaaphi kam he
 However, after a landslide victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the NDA will have a majority in the Rajya Sabha by the end of next year and after that it will be easy for the Modi government to pursue its legislative agenda
 philhal endie ke paas rajyasabha main 102 sadsy hai, jabaki congress netritv vaale upie ke paas 66 or donon gathbannon se baahar kii partiyon ke paas 66 sadsy hai
 About 18 seats will be added to the NDA camp by November next year
 endie ko kuch namit, nirdaleey sadasyon kaa bhi samarthan mil saktaa he
 Half the number in the Rajya Sabha is 123 and the members of the upper house are elected by the members of the state assembly
 bijepi netritv vaali sarkaar kaa prayaas apane vidhaayi agenda ko aage badhaane kaa hoga, jo pichley paanch saalon ke dauraan vipaksh ke virodh ke kaaran aage nahin bad paa rahi thim
 The government could not pass the triple talaq bill, although this bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak bhi paas nahin ho paaya he
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni's style is different
 chaahe vah cricket khelnaa kaa style ho yaa phir match practice kaa
 Dhoni's strategy of less practice and better results has always proved effective for Dhoni in his international career of more than a decade
 99 par note out hai captain mahendra singh dhonibhale hi zyaadaatar log is baat par vishwaas na karen, par bhartiya captain ne pichley teen saal se bhi adhik samay se nets par routine wicketcaping abhyaas nahin kiya
 Despite this, he has maintained his brilliant performance behind the wicket by practicing ten catches on match day
 ise aap maahi kaa tarika kah sakate hai lekin bhartiya team ke abhyaas satr par kareebi najar rakhane vaale jaanate hai ki unhone nets par dhoni ko wicketcaping pad pahane hue shaayad hi dekha ho,
 He sometimes wears wicketkeeping gloves but no pads
 vah kshetrarakshan se sambandhit sabhi abhyaas karte hai
 Let's practice taking catches
 ballebaaji karte hai or kabhi kabhaar gendbaaji main bhi haath aajamaate hai lekin wicketcaping nahin karte
 Whether Syed Kirmani or Kiran More or Nayan Mongia or in recent times Wriddhiman Saha used to practice wicketkeeping fiercely, but Dhoni's approach is completely different

 ’ Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni dismissed the batsmen's selection of alcohol shots, blaming the unexpected pitch for poor batting in the second ODI against Sri Lanka
 bharat ko yahaan 33
 Sri Lanka openers Upul Tharanga (59 not out) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (50) played 119 for the first wicket to put the hosts on par with the series 1–1 after being piled on for just 138 runs in 3 overs
 
 dhoni ne pehle match kii pich ke sandarbh main kaha, jis pich par match khelaa gaya vah pichhali baar kii pich se agali thi lekin isane puri tarah alag vyavhaar kiya
 He said that the wicket was a bit slow in the beginning

 Dhoni said that the team needs to learn from the mistakes and improve it in the upcoming matches

 He said that the pitch was probably a bit slow and some good balls were also thrown
 hamane sahi kshetron main gendbaaji kii, dabaav banaaya, or shaayad kuch kharaab shot bhi khele gaye
 Jayawardene praised his team's all-round performance and said his players had more hunger for victory

 pichley match main hamane kuch galtiyaan kin or aaj hamane kaaphi acchhee chijen kin
 We showed that we can make a comeback
 jayavardhane ne tharanga kii tarif karte hue kaha ki is salaami ballebaaj ko farm main vaapasi karte hue dekhakar acha laga
 The Sri Lankan captain also praised fast bowlers Tishara Perera (3 for 19) and Angelo Mathews (3 for 14) who blasted India's top order
 unhone kaha, tishaara or angelo ne hamaara kaam aasaan kar diya
 Man of the Match Perera thanked his teammates for believing in his ability
 unhone kaha, main apane pradarshan se kaaphi khush hum
 i want to thank my teammates
 main apane pradarshan ke bare main kaaphi nahin sochataa or sirf maidan par apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karnaa chahta hum
 33 to India here
 3 over main sirf 138 ran par dher karne ke baad srilanka ke salaami ballebaajon upul tharanga (naabad 59) or tillakaratne dilashaan (50) ne pehle wicket ke liye 119 ran jodakar mejabaan team ko shrunkhlaa main 1-1 se barabari dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai
 Dhoni said in terms of the pitch of the first match, the pitch on which the match was played was next from the previous pitch but it behaved completely differently
 unhone kaha ki shuruyaat main wicket thodaa dhimaa tha
 We quickly lost a few wickets after Virat Kohli was dismissed
 dhoni ne kaha ki team ko galatiyon se sabak lene or aagaamee maichon main isamen sudhaar karne kii jarurat he
 Dhoni also praised Gautam Gambhir, who managed to score 65 runs to retain one end and be the last batsman to be dismissed, but Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene disagreed with Dhoni's opinion and said the wicket was not that bad
 unhone kaha ki sambhavat: pich thodi dhimi thi or kuch acchhee genden bhi phenki gayi
 We bowled in the right areas, built up the pressure, and maybe some bad shots were also played
 jayavardhane ne apni team ke harfanmaulaa pradarshan kii tarif kii or kaha ki unke khilaadiyon main jeet ke liye or bhukh he
 The comments unhone kaha, yah kaaphi mjedaar he ki do din main kya ho saktaa he
 We made some mistakes in the last match and today we did a lot of good things
 hamane dikhaaya ki ham vaapasi kar sakate hai
 Jayawardene praised Tharanga and said that it was good to see this opener returning to form
 srilankai captain ne tej gendbaajon tishaara perera (19 ran par teen wicket) or angelo maithyuj (14 ran par teen wicket) kii bhi tarif kii jinhone bharat ke sheersh kram ko dhwast kar diya
 He said, Tishara and Angelo made our work easy

 He also said that his Mumbai board has not given a certificate to 'kabali', but the film has been passed from the Chennai office

 Earlier, this happened to Salman Khan's 'sultan'
