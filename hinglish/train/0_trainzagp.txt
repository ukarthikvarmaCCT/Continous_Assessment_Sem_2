 The army chief said, "india reserves the right to give the right answer to Pakistan at its appropriate time and place

 Perhaps one of the reasons for the growing anger in the army was that Pakistan refused to take responsibility for this audacious action

 Lack of complete preparedness for the attack as a punitive action by the army chief is the maximum that the Indian Army can open fire on Pakistani posts

 '' bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne apane mantrimandal vistaar main soshal ejineering kaa puraa dhyaan rakhaa he
 Of the 8 ministers included in the cabinet, 2 are from Dalit society, 2 from the backward and backward castes and 2 from upper caste quota
 is tarah jediu ke 21 mantriyon kaa kota ab puraa ho gaya hai
 Whereas bjp's quota of 2 ministers is still vacant
 bihar main siton ke anupaat ke hisaab se 36 mantri banaae ja sakate hai
 When the NDA government was formed in July 2017, 15 JDU quota was made from 15 BJP quota and one minister from LJP
 lekin haal hi main hue loksabhaa chunaav main bihar sarkaar ke teen cabinet mantri saansad ban gaye, isliye yah vistaar jaruri mana ja rahaa tha
 However, questions are being raised about the timing of cabinet expansion
 kaha ja rahaa he ki kendriya mantrimandal ke gathan ke teen din baad hi vistaar kar nitish kumaar bijepi ko sandesh dena chaah rahe hai
 He got wind when JDU quota was made 8 ministers

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself said that the decision to expand the cabinet has been taken in collaboration with allies
 chunki 26 se bihar vidhansabha kaa satr shuru hone vaala he isliye mantriyon kaa hona jaruri ho gaya tha
 Three cabinet ministers had resigned as mps
 duusari taraf jo mantri saansad bane usamen lalan singh jal sansaadhan mantri or dinesh chandra yadav aapadaa prabandhan mantri the
 Both of these are important portfolios of the times to come, because of the problem of floods or drought in Bihar, it is very important to have ministers in these two ministries in Surat
 duusari taraf mantrimandal vistaar kii charchaa kaaphi pehle se ho rahi thi
 Last year, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had assured that the cabinet would expand after Dussehra
 lekin baad main kaha ki is saal dashahra se pehle vistaar kar denge or unhone loksabhaa chunaav ke thik baad apana vaada nibhaayaa
 Many former ministers were in the position of minister for the last two years
 jisamen congress ke purv pradesh adhyaksh ashok choudhary jo mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar main shiksha mantri the, baad main wo jediu main shaamil ho gaye
 Secondly Shyam Rajak, who has been a minister many times but did not get a ministerial position in the Grand Alliance government
 kaha jaataa he ki us samay lalu prasad yadav ne inke mantrimandal main shaamil hone kaa virodh kiya tha
 Meanwhile, Shyam Rajak was looking after the organization work at JDU
 sanjay kumaar jha darbhanga ke loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladanaa chaahate the
 But the tickets went to the BJP account, so he was very hurt, he also got the post of minister

 Vima Bharti, coming from a very backward caste, became a minister in Jitanram Manjhi's cabinet for some time

 As a social worker i am replying
 unhone kaha ki hamaari party main anushaasan he, lekin main dalit kii pitayee ke maamle main apana mat detaa hum
 He said that in a city like Ahmedabad, the condition of Dalits is so bad that if Dalit lives in a society, then all people despise it
 usko majaboor kiya jaataa he ki vah apana ghar bechakar chalaa jaae
 The BJP MP said that in the latest case of murder of Dalit, the government took strict action and an FIR has been registered against five people
 udit raaj ne kaha, sarkaar se main anurodh karata hum ki jis nirdosh ko maaraa gaya he, uske aaropee ko sakht se sakht sajaa di jaae
 So that no new matter comes forward
 unhone kaha kidaliton ke maamle paravishleshan hona chahie or yah pataa karnaa chahie ki is bhedbhaav ko lekar uski vajah kya he
 In any state like Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka or Kerala, such incidents should not be encountered
 unhone kaha ki kanoonee vyavastha se isko jodakar dekhnaa thik nahin he
 The social system is responsible for this and needs to be improved
 udit raaj ne kaha ki sarkaar is par karrwai nahin karti to us sarkaar par kaarywahi honi chahie
 He said that every party will try to take advantage of the issue of Dalits
 pradhanmantri ji hameshaa daliton ke prati chintit rahete hai
 He is constantly working in the interest of Dalits, the opposition constantly accuses, no one can stop the allegations

 The CBI is currently interrogating all the arrested accused

 It is very rare that a Pakistani politician should shy away from his favorite subject - India censure - during a conversation
 asif ali jaradaari aise hi netaa hai
 Zardari, 52, co-chairman of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), spoke on the unfinished work of Benazir Bhutto and the need to strengthen india-pakistan relations during a 90-minute conversation with Editor Prabhu Chawla for TV channel Aaj Tak
 baatcheet ke anshambibi kii asamyik maut ke baad aapaki jindagi kitni badali he?na keval meri jindagi badali he balki pakistan or duniya ke halaat badal gaye hai
 As long as she was alive, i did not care
 ve har cheez kaa khyaal rakhti thim
 You were in jail for about 11 years
 aap donon-bibi jail ke baahar se or aap salaakhon ke peeche se sangharsh kar rahe the
 Yes, both of us were fighting together
 yahaan tak ki aaj bhi ham unke jazbe ko apane irdagird mahasoos karte hai
 In my last conversation with me, Bibi said, "I know my life is in danger but i am going to Pakistan only for the sake of humanity
" meraa sabase bada kaam faujee hukumat ko khatm karnaa he
 "he laid down his life for the restoration of democracy in the country
" lekin unki maut ke chah maheene baad bhi faujee hukumat khatm nahin hui he
 Their sacrifice will not go in vain
 ham jamhuriyat behaal karne ke liye kaam kar rahe hai
 There is military rule in the country but Pervez Musharraf has no such position in it
 pakistan ke logon ne piemail-en or pipipi, donon ko isi ummid se chunaa tha
 You both wanted to remove them
 to phir isamen itnaa vakt kyon lag rahaa he?bharat ke ulat, hamaare yahaan kabhi saz sarkaar nahin rahi
 This is the first time this has happened in our country
 donon partiyon kii siten kareeb-kareeb baraabar hai
 Even if we both meet, we will have less seats to remove them
 hamen duusari partiyon kaa bhi sahaara hasil nahin he
 Have you set any deadline to remove Musharraf? Political people rarely take care of deadlines
 lekin ham unhen jaldi hi baahar kar denge
 You are the working president of the party, although your son Bilal is the chairman
 jab aap khud adhyaksh ban sakate the to phir aapane aisa kyon kiya?hamane bilaval ko isliye chunaa he kyonki vah hamaara bhavishya he, vah hamaara vartmaan he
 Our new slogan is: Bhutto's picture Benazir, Benazir's picture Bilawal
 bilaval hamaara mustakabil he
 i am a trustee of Benazir's legacy
 log kehete hai ki aap pakistan ke sonia gandhi hai
 The way she controls the government from 10 Janpath in Delhi, similarly you do with Bilawal House in Karachi
 nahin, main bilaval house se hukumat ko control karne kii koshish nahin karata kyonki zyaadaatar vakt islamabad main hi rahata hum
 Soniaji is a great leader and there is no doubt that i am trying to learn from her about jumriyat

 aapane pichley 100 dinon main bibi kii hatya kii jaanch teji se karaane ke liye koi thos upaay nahin kiya he
 Here in Pakistan, i feel a big conspiracy behind his murder
 main mahaj itnaa hi pataa nahin lagaana chahta ki unka katl kin logon ne kiya, balki meraa makasad he ki duniya jane ki unki maut se kya ho saktaa he
 With this, Pakistan can be divided into many small pieces, and ultimately the fate of this entire region can be the same
 mana jaataa he ki bibi america kii purajor samarthak thim
 And that's why they were murdered
 ve kattarpathiyon ke nishane par thim, kya aap bhi america se prabhavit hai?hamane mulk main jamhuriyat kii bahaali ke liye sabhi partiyon se madad maangi he
 America, Britain and India are all powerful forces
 bibi ne sabhi jamhuri deshon kaa daura kiya or unke daure se lambey arase tak kaaphi madad mili
 She was also ruling out of the country
 kya pipipi america ke prati naram ravaiya rakhti he, jaisaa ki kuch roj pehle navaj sharif ne kaha? kya aap maanate hai ki america aapke gharelu maamalon main bahut dakhlandaji kar rahaa he?america ek dost he
 The Taliban were trouble and will remain
 hamen unase ladanaa hoga or ham unhen baahar karne ke liye har mumkin koshish kar rahe hai
 We have to solve it by negotiation or fight with radical forces
 hamen unhen samaj-bujhakar apane saath laa sakate hai
 Why don't you forget Kashmir for some time? Why should India and Pakistan quarrel over this? We cannot forget Kashmir
 aapaki hi tarah ham bhi is masale kaa hal chaahate hai
 We want to resolve this issue through dialogue
 ham vyapaar karnaa chaahate hai
 Think about it, India and Pakistan together can become superpower
 bharat kaa maananaa he ki vishwaas bahaali ke upayon ke tahat pakistan ko kashmir main aatankwaadi shivi khatm kar dene chahie or uske gharelu maamalon main hastkshep nahin karnaa chahie
 Will your rule do this? Neither we interfere in anyone's case, nor do we like to interfere in our case
 ham dehshatgardi ke khilaaf hai
 Sharif says the visa system should be scrapped
 kya aap unase sahamat hai?agar ve is bill ko parliament main laaen to ise paarit karaane ke liye hamaare paas bahumat he
 Why don't you give priority to India for improving mutual trade? We are ready to give preference and want the same with ourselves
 ham chaahate hai ki bharat is upmahadweep main bade bhai kaa role nibhaae
 Pakistan can act as a catalyst for India's progress
 agar bharat or pakistan ek ho jaaen to yakeenan hamaari takat kaa loha mana jayega
 Now give quick answers to five questions: Who are your friends, Sharif or Musharraf? Nawaz Sharif
 aap kargil ke liye kisko jimmedaar maanate hai?yah itihaas kii baat he or main un donon ko iske liye jimmedaar maanata hum
 Will you ever be able to arrest Bibi's killers? Bibi has written in her book that her death will be due to change
 ham yakeenan unhen giraftaar karenge, lekin ham pakistan kaa nizaam badalanaa chaahate hai
 Would you like to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan? i would not say that i will never be, but i will never try to do so
 kya aap hathiyaar kharidne ke liye china se haath milaayenge yaa pakistan kii pragati ke liye bharat se dosti karenge?main pakistan kii tarakkee ke liye bharat or china, donon se dosti karne se gurej nahin karuunga

 As the rhetoric intensifies between BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and Madhya Pradesh BJP president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan, it is a big challenge for the party to stop this infighting
 afasaron par barase vijayawargiyadrasal isaki shuruyatkailash vijayawargiyake us twit se hui, jisamen unhone indore metro project kii dhimi raftaar ko lekar rajya sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue twit kiya tha
 However, Vijayvargiya immediately deleted the tweet and blamed the officials for it in the new tweet
 iske baad ek nijee kaarykram main kailash nufasarshahiko aade haathon lete hue kaha tha ki kuch logon ko aisa lagata he ki duniya unke bharose chal rahi he, lekin aise logon ko haisiyat bataanaa jaruri he

 It became difficult for the party to clarify, after this reaction of Kailash Vijayvargiya, the Congress got a chance to attack the sitting BJP
 congress ne is mudde par bijepi pradesh adhyaksh ko siem kaa bhompu bataaya or kaha ki puri ladaai mafia se mili paise ke bantwaare ko lekar ho rahi he
 On this whole issue, Nandkumar Singh Chauhanmedia did not appear for the whole day on Wednesday, while the BJP too remained silent

 Although the BJP is claiming that this is a small thing, everything is fine, but for the last few days, the sharp attitude of Kailash Vijayvargiya about the government and the bureaucracy can cause problems for the government

 There was a time in the Bollywood industry when filmmakers wanted to make more and more multi-starrer films
 lekin guzarate samay ke saath silver screen par single hero kii filmon ko craij badhane laga
 These days there are very few actors in the film industry who want to share the silver screen with other stars
 lekin akshay kumaar bollywood ke un abhinaytaon main se ek hai, jinhen film main ek se zyada actor hone se fark nahin padataa he
 This is revealed by Akshay Kumar himself
 ek nae intervyuu main akshay ne bataaya, 'main aisi film main kaam karnaa chahta hum, jisaki story acchhee hoti he
 If the film is good, then i have no objection to playing a minor role in it
 itani hi nahin agar film main kisi duusare actor kaa mujhase bada role hoga tab bhi mujhe koi shikaayat nahin hogi
 Just the script should be great
 'akshay kumaar ne bina kisi kaa naam liye ye bhi bataaya ki kai stars aise bhi hai, jinhen multi starer film main kaam karnaa pasand nahin he, kyonki unhen aisi filmein karne main shame mahasoos hoti he

 'I have a habit of ups and downs', Singh said, adding that the ordinance protecting public representatives from immediate disqualification was considered at a higher level, twice in the cabinet and in the Congress core group
 unhone apane ek purv vaktavy kaa zikr karte hue kaha, ‘maine kaha tha ki main in tamaam maamalon ko apane mantrimandal ke sahyogiyon ke saamne rakh duungaa

 Senior BJP leader Lal Krishna Advani may not have been as politically tense as he is now
 ab to jaise saaya bhi unke saath nahin rahaa
 He could not hide his feelings when he found his most important partner of Patna with him for just a few minutes (a formality)
 14 november bal diwas ke maukey par patna airport par jo kuch hua, vahabijapi ke pitamahaki party main haisiyat bataane ke liye kaaphi tha
 At 3 pm, the crowd gathered at the Patna airport to welcome the three ministers broke off the airport, the crowd reached the runway and the ministers had to board the bus to avoid the crowd
 duusari taraf usee vaktadwanitanha, bilkul akele patna ke danapur main bacchon ke ek kaarykram shirkat kar rahe the
 Seated among the children of the exploited society in Patna's Danapur, not a single BJP leader was present with Advani
 unke kaaphi kareebi or bade samarthak maane jane vaale bihari babu yani shatrughan sinha bhi adwani ke paas aae to jarur, lekin ye sirf aupchaarikta bhar tha
 In a few minutes, Bihari Babu left the middle of the program by playing formalities
 adwani ek baar phir us kaarykram main bilkul tanha rah gaye, lekin jab unhone manch par bolnaa shuru kiya to unka ye dard saamne aa gaya
 On the other hand, there was a stampede-like situation at Patna airport, when a crowd of supporters gathered for the newly minted ministers blew security at Patna Airport
 ye saaf ho gaya ki adwani patna aae jarur, lekin unhen bijepi kii ore se poochne vaala koi nahi tha
 However, while talking to a news agency, Advani definitely said that he has no qualms about not becoming PM and the country is going through a big change at the moment
 adwani kii is patna yatra ne ek baat to saaf kar di ki kabhi bijepi ko apane haathon se sajaane-sanvaarane vaala ye shaks itnaa tanha ho chukaa he jiske liye party or netaaon ke paas koi vakt nahin he
 Released this Friday, Yash Raj banner's 'gunday', featuring Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor performing hooliganism, along with Priyanka Chopra, Irrfan Khan and Saurabh Shukla
 
 
 film kii kahani gumti he, vikram or bala, yani ranvir singh or arjuna kapur ke irdagird, jo varsh 1971 ke hindustan−pakistan yuddh ke baad bangladesh main rah jate hai, or baad main unhen majabuuran waapas us vakt ke kalakatta kaa rukh karnaa pad jaataa he
 
 
 Circumstances force both of them to become punk, after which Nandita, ie Priyanka Chopra, who is a cabaret dancer, gives her heart
 
 
 'gunde' yaad dilaati he, '70 ke dashak ke cinema kii, jahaan 'diwaar' or 'zanjeer' thim, yaa '80 ke dashak main ai amitabh bachchan or shatrughna sinha kii 'dostana'
 
 
 You will be seen in the film 'gunday' of some similar films
 
 
 heroism kaa vah andaaz, jo '70 ke diarectaron or actaron ne bade parde par rachaa tha, use darshak phir mahasoos kar paaenge
 
 
 Be it the scenes of the film, the 'larger than life' character of Vikram and Bala, or the treatment of the film
 
 
 isamen koi andeh nahin, ki ranvir singh or arjuna kapur kii jodi aapako kabhi amitabh−shatrughna or kabhi amitabh−vinod khanna kii yaad dilaaegi, lekin ali abbaas zafer kahani main kuch chook gaye, kyonki shuruyaat se hi samaj aane lagata he, kya hone vaala he
 
 
 That is, you already know what is going to happen next
 
 
 udhar, film ke gane vaise to achche he or lokapriy bhi ho chuke hai, lekin kai jagah film kii raftaar par brake laga dete hai
 
 
 Scenes are used to kill in any film, but there is a lack of it here
 
 
 haalanki film ke kai seens bahut achche bhang se filmaae gaye hai, vah bhi stylish andaaz main
 
 
 The camera work is good, and Priyanka is looking good in the film
 
 
 irfan kaa kaam acha he, ranvir ek baar phir baazi maar le gaye hai, lekin puraane andaaz main nazar aate hai
 
 
 He should have been a little more comfortable in acting
 
 
 ek baat jo film main khatkati he, vah he ki film main bengal or bangladesh kaa conection dikhaaya to gaya he, lekin irfan ke alaava kisi bhi kirdaar main bengal kii jhalak nahin nazar aati
 
 
 So if you like '70s cinema and you want to watch only and only masala films then you can definitely see' goons'
 
 
 is film ke liye meri reating he - 3 star

 Now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the matter
 isaki sunwaayee chif justise ranjan gogoi or justise sanjay khanna kii peeth karegi
 Let us tell you that the Modi government had made the 124th amendment to the Constitution to give 10 per cent reservation to the general class on economic grounds
 sansad ke donon sadanon ne is aarakshan vidheyak ko mahaj 2 din main hi paarit kar diya tha
 After this, the bill was approved by President Ramnath Kovind in three days

 This reservation law was first implemented by the Gujarat government

 However, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee refused to implement this reservation law in her province
 iske alaava diemke adhyaksh emke stallin bhi aarthik aadhaar par aarakshan dene kaa purajor virodh kar rahe hai

 diemke ne kaha ki indira saahani cese main supreme court ne kaha tha ki aarthik maandand samvidhan ke tahat aarakshan kaa ekmaatr aadhaar nahin ho saktaa
 Such a constitutional amendment is flawed and should be held illegal
 vahiin, centre sarkaar garib logon ko aarakshan dene ke apane faisle ko sahi tehra chuki he
 On this, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that this system with constitutional validity of 10% reservation in jobs and education on economic basis will help the poor of the general class
 saath hi unka jivan str sudharega
 During this time, the Finance Minister also attacked the parties and leaders opposing this reservation

 He wrote, 'everyone knows that in the assembly elections, BJP had included many of our mlas and leaders in their camp
 agar ve sarkaar banane main sakasham hote hai, to ve phir se or adhik sakhti ke saath aisa karenge
 In such a situation, if we are able to form a government with Shiv Sena, then it can be stopped and with this we will be able to strengthen our base
 'unhone kaha, vishesh rup se, maharashtra main alpsankhyak samudaay linching par bhaajapa sarkaar ke agenda ko lekar atisamvedansheel hai

 " The entire nation is celebrating 68th Republic Day and on this special occasion is saluting the real heroes posted on the border who, under adverse conditions, withstand every difficulty, give us a chance to sleep peacefully and breathe free air
 ye sachche raashtra nayak hamaare seemaa prahari hai, jo har pal sarhad par tainaat rahete hai
 Hundreds of thousands of kilometers away from their loved ones continue to serve the motherland, regardless of their lives
 ganatantr diwas jiserashtriya parvajahan hamen bhartiya hone ke garv kaa ahsaas karaate hai, vahiin in rashtranayakon ko unke adamya saahas or balidaan ke liye salaam karne kaa mauka bhi hote hai
 It is not easy to stand fearless at the border
 tvf's Manohar Virani has paid tribute to the soldiers who have died for the real heroes of the country, ie Watan
 tivief ne hero motocorp ke saath milakar ek video banaaya he, jise utyub par aplod kiya gaya he
 In this, Virani has presented the experience of spending a day with soldiers
 video main najar aa rahaa phogiyon kaa hausala, jajba or desh ke prati unki nishtha kisi ko bhi garv se bhar dene ke liye kaaphi he
 In order to die on the country, our soldiers, who are standing at the same time, face the evil intentions of the enemy, so that no one can break the security of the country
 phogiyon ke isi jazbe ko bade behtareen or dilachasp dhang se dikhaaya gaya he
 Be careful every moment
 a soldier's life is completely different and difficult than that of a normal working citizen
 aam log jab man kare, kuch der ke liye brake le lete hai
 Entice yourself with friends on social media or go for a walk outside the office
 lekin ek faujee ko duty ke dauraan brake milanaa naammumkin hota he
 Troopers have to be alert every moment because they have the responsibility of security of the country on their shoulders
 choti se choti halchal par bhi paini najar banaae rakhni hoti he kyonkidushmankabhi bhi or kahin se bhi hamalaa kar sakate hai
 Today every other person is seen sticking to the smartphone
 lekin koi faujee bandook chhodkar smartphone par apane massej nahin dekhtaa
 He waits for the letter coming from his house
 jab wo chitthee use milti he, to use padhakar hi santosh kar letaa he
 Can not afford to risk films on the border The real heroes of the command are completely different from the film screen
 unamem deshbhakti kii bhaavana becoground mujeec se nahin aati, balki deshbhakti unke rag-rag main hoti he
 In many films, the lives of soldiers have been shown in a very different way
 lekin asal main phogiyon kii jindagi kaaphi mushkil hoti he
 There is no weekend on the outskirts
 agar koi faujee post par bandook thame khadaa he or saamne se goliyaan chal rahi hai, to laghushanka ke liye bhi ghanton tak intjaar karnaa padataa he
 The common man cannot even imagine how difficult life would be for the troops stationed on the snow-capped hills
 petroling ke dauraan kab pair ke neeche landmine aa jaae kaha nahin ja saktaa
 Every step of the troops is full of danger
 agle pal phogiyon kii jindagi main kya hoga, iskaa pataa kisi ko nahin hota
 But regardless of this, the army remains on duty
 24 ghante on duty rahete hai faujiek aam kaamkaaji insaan ko offis se nikalakar ghar bhaagane kii har roj jaldi hoti he
 But the soldiers have to stay at their posts away from home for months
 ghar se kaam karne kaa vikalp bhi phogiyon ke paas nahin hota he
 On the outskirts there is a tent just in the name of the house, where they meet for a few hours to rest
 aaj kii yuva peedi ko neend ke liye ghanton soshal media par apni ankhon ko thakaana padataa he
 But it has been told in the video that the soldiers get only four to five hours on the outskirts to sleep
 isamen chaahe so lo yaa phir duusare kaam kar lo
 Yes, if the enemy strikes during this period, then you have to leave sleep and then take over the post
 ek faujee 24 ghante sarhad par on duty hota he
 Something similar happens in the life of real heroes of our country
 ye khud takaliphen sehate hai, taaki desh kii aam janata aaraam se rah sake
 Let us salute these real heroes of the country on the occasion of Republic Day
 bijepi ke padaadhikariyon ko 30 minute ke bhaashan main piem modi ne kaha ki 'party or sarkaar ke kaam ke liye soshal media kaa zyada istemaal karen
 It is the responsibility of the party leaders to convey the suggestions of the workers to the government

 "how big a problem is spreading among families, it can be gauged from the fact that one out of every three people in America is living in a step family and now the number of such families is increasing in India too
" ‘‘swytt vyaktvaad’’ kii avadharanadesh ke pratishthit jawahar laal nehru vishvavidhyalay ke skool aaf soshal sciensej ke dean professor anand kumaar ne is mudde par kaha ki europe or america main is prakaar ke sautele pariwaron ko janm dene main vahaan kii aarthik or saanskrithik vyavastha ne khaas yogadan diya he or vahaan ek parivaar kii ikai kaa sthaan ab ‘‘swytt vyaktvaad’’ ne le liya he
 He explained that in the "autonomous individualism" system, the concept of step family is easily accepted, but in a country like India, where even today in the family unit, traditionalism is given more importance than modernity, there is a view to accept it The situation is more complicated than that
 america kii blendid 'family'yah samasya chunki europea or america deshon se bharat main aa rahi he to iskaa tulanaatmak zikr jaruri ho jaataa he
 According to an estimate, one out of every third person in the US is living in a step family today, and in the near future more than 50 percent of Americans will be forced to become part of the step family at some point in their lifetime
 vahaan aaj 33 fisadi bachche sautele pariwaron main pal rahe hai
 These types of families are also called "blended families" in the US
 pro kumaar kehete hai ki europe or america main parivaar naam kii sanstha kis prakaar gaayab ho chuki he, iskaa andaja isi se laga sakate hai ki vahaan ab ‘‘vyactik jindagi kaa aanvikaran’’ ho chukaa he yani niztaa main bhi ghor niztaa dikhaai pads rahi he
 India is also not untouched, he says that this "atomization in individual life" has not started in India, but it can be avoided for a long time, it is not so
 abhi jo sthiti he vah ‘‘radical deparchar’’ kii he or yah sthiti ek din aegi
 Pro
 kumaar kaa kahana he ki badhate talaak, mahilaon kaa shashaktikaran or badalte saamaajik saanskrithik mulyon ke chalate aisa hona lajimi he
 Problems in Family Attachment: If a family is a reality of a changing life, then what will be the nature of the ordeal of emotional relationships
 is mudde par 1998 main america main karwaae gaye ek surveykshan main darshaya gaya tha ki sautele mata pita or sautele bacchon ko nae parivaar, nae parivesh main bhaavnaatmak lagaav sthapit karne main kam se kam chaar baras kaa samay lagata he or bachche jitne chote hote hai, yah prakriya utani hi kam jatil hoti he
 It may be interesting to mention Basu Chatterjee's film "khatta Meetha" in the 70s in the US on "step Family Day", in which the same problem of two step families was presented in a dramatic and playful manner
 Was
 aaj yah samasya jis prakaar se bad rahi he usase lagata he ki yah film kaaphi duuradrushti ke saath banaayi gayi thi
 However, it was not as successful on screen

 Due to increasing pollution, many people are suffering from serious respiratory diseases and if the conditions remain the same then in the coming times, difficulties for the elderly, children and pregnant women can increase

 The role of the central government, state government and the common man is essential in these 13 measures
 agar in 13 upayon par amal kar in par kaam kiya jaae to pradooshan ko 40 fisadi tak kam kiya ja saktaa he or saath hi har saal pradooshan se hone vaali 9 lakh mauton ko bhi roka ja saktaa he
 These 13 measures are PM 2 in the entire North India including Delhi in winter

 The report released in this research has explained in detail the steps needed to be taken to understand and solve the causes of pollution, including: - Emitting from thermal power plants (ongoing, under construction and new power plants) Stricter standards should be created regarding emissions
 - manyufaccharing udyog ke liye bhi sakht maanak hone chahie or maanakon par khara na utarane par dandatmak karrwai honi chahie
 - Use of jig jack process in brick furnace - Changing the solid fuel used in homes - High emphasis on transportation and regulating the smoke emanating from the vehicles - Alternatives to burning the straw - Options for burning garbage - Building construction Timely adherence to strict standards - If the government and the common man cooperate in all these areas, then pollution will be reduced

 supreme court ne sibiai ke diarector se poocha ki pichley saal aapke adhikariyon dwaara bansal ke ghar chhapemari karne ke baad hi bansal kii patni or beti ne khudakushi kyon kii
 Questioning the behavior of CBI officers, the Supreme Court said that there would be some reason for this, the behavior of your officers is not correct many times
 supreme court ne sibiai ke diarector se do saptaah ke andar sawaalon ke jawaab or apni pratikriya dene ke liye kaha he
 Some of the CBI officials were also under the scanner as the entire family committed suicide by Bansal
 ullekhneey he ki rishwat lene ke aaropon ke khilaaf sibiai jaanch ke dauraan pehle bike bansal kii patni or beti ne khudakushi kar lee thi
 a few days later, Bansal also committed suicide with his son in his East Delhi home
 bansal ko rishwat lete hue range haath pakadaa gaya tha
 a case under Prevention of Corruption Act 1988 was registered against Bansal
 bansal ne khudakushi karne se pahalesuicide note ke chaar setchode the, jisamen unhone sibiai par utpeedan ke gambhir aarope lagaae the
 a fact-finding committee was set up to investigate the allegations of human rights abuses leveled by Bansal on the CBI
 sibiai ne haalanki apni jaanch main kaha he ki jaanch or chhapemari ke dauraan unke adhikariyon ne bansal or unke parivaar waalon ko pareshaan nahin kiya
 On September 28 last year, Mandsal and his son were found hanging from the lashpunk in their house in East Delhi
 isse do maheene pehle unki patni or beti ne bhi isi ghar main khudakushi kar lee thi
 Bansal was accused of taking bribe from a pharmaceutical company
 company apane khilaaf chal rahi jaanch band karwaanaa chaahati thi

 The committee has clearly termed it a violation of the guidelines of the Supreme Court which is necessary for any government to follow while advertising
 supreme court ke aadesh par centre sarkaar ne sarkari vigyapanon kii jaanch ke liye purv mukhya chunaav ayukta bi
 B
 tandon kii adhyakshata main teen sadasyeey samiti kaa gathan kiya tha

 The High Court disposed of that petition after the formation of this committee

 Urmila, angered by the internal factionalism of the Mumbai Congress, said that my political and social sensibilities are there to achieve the big goal, but due to the internal politics of the Mumbai Congress, i am not able to do so
 jari bayaan main urmila matondkar ne kaha ki main bhartiya rashtriya congress se istipha de chuki hum
 i first started thinking about resignation when no action was taken despite my repeated efforts and later wrote a letter to the then Mumbai Congress chief Milind Deora

 It was a betrayal of me
 urmila ne kaha ki kehane kii jarurat nahin he ki party main kisi bhi vyakti ne mere baar-baar ke virodh ke baavjood maafee nahin maangi
 Significantly, for the poor performance of the Congress in Mumbai North, especially those whom my letter was referring to, no action was taken against them for their acts but they were only rewarded with new posts
 haalanki, yah spasht he ki mumbai congress ke pramukh padaadhikari party kii behatari ke liye sanghathan main badlaav or parivartan laane main asamarth hai

 On the power of demonetisation, Tejashwi had questioned the matter a day earlier
 unhone kaha tha ki lojpa or jediu ko pradhanmantri narendra modi se notebandi par sawaal poochne kaa phayda do saal baad mila he
 With this, he described the situation of NDA in Bihar as thin
 tejasvi ne siton kaa elaan hone ke baad twit kiya tha, 'LJP or JDU ko pradhanmantri modi se notebandi par sawaal poochne kaa phayda do saal baad mila he
 Even after the mandate theft, the BJP became so strong in Bihar that despite having 22 sitting mps, it will contest on 17 seats and Nitish ji with 2 mps will also contest on 17 seats

 Narendra Modi said in his meetings that the development work that is being seen in Gujarat is due to the money spent by the state government
 unhone janata ko yah baat samajhaaii ki congress ke raaj main kamishan agent or netaa, donon hi bich main 'paisa gol' karne kii aadi ho chuke the, jisapar unhone puri tarah se lagaam kas di he
 In 'kallol Hai Mere Kurta' Kallol and Mansa, Narendra Modi said in his meetings, 'congress says i am very confused
 vah yah aarope lagaati he ki mere paas 250 jode kurte hai

 Let me tell you that there are 12 football players and one coach in 13 lives
 inke alaava kareeb 1000 rahtakarmi lage hai
 The biggest question among all of these is whether the children will survive
 puri duniya kii nigahen unpar lagi hui hai
 The biggest question is that if the relief workers have reached and found the children, then why did they not bring the children out
 inhen bachaane ke liye thailand kii sena lagi hui he, lekin rescue oparation main 3 se 4 maheene bhi lag sakate hai
 The death of a diver who was going to supply oxygen to the children made the operation more dangerous

 barish main hameshaa ingufaaonmen pani bhar jaataa he or sitambar ke maheene tak hi utarataa he
 The children did not eat for 9 days, only they were alive with the help of flood water
 bacchon ko ye tak nahin pataa tha ki ve kitne din se fanse hue hai
 There is a cave under the mountains
 kuch raste upar jate hai or kuch neeche
 There is water in every connecting link
 bacchon ko na tairnaa or na hi ghota lagaana aata he
 Children are being taught swimming and diving
 gupha ke andar doctoron kaa ek dal pahunch chukaa he
 The diver has delivered the food
 bacchon ke liye 4 maheene ke khaane kaa intjaam kar diya gaya he
 a phone call was also sent for a conversation, but that too deteriorated due to wet
 pani nikaalane ke liye pump laga hua he
 The water level of the cave has decreased by 16 cm
 lekin pahaad se riskar pani dobaaraa bhar ja rahaa he
 There is a fear that if there is heavy rain again, the place where the children have taken shelter may sink and there is a warning of heavy rain for the next few days
 aise main aaj kaa din bacchon ke jidangi bachaane ke liye kaaphi mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 Explain that in the operation started on the 15th day, 13 international and 5 Thai Navy SEAL divers have been sent to the cave
 ek bachche do gotaakhor ke saath baahar aaenge
 It may take up to 11 hours for the first child to come out
 sabhi bachche ek saath baahar nahin aa paaenge
 The operation can last two to 4 days
