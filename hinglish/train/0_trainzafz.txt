 The tobacco company wants to file a petition against this order
 sampradayik hinsa ko ham ek tay frem main dekhne lage hai
 The result is that we ignore the new incident even before it has happened, because in every such incident, all the aspects of the debate are almost fixed
 koun sa sawaal hoga, koun sa jawaab hoga, koun sa paksh hoga, isliye bhi aap yaa ham sampradayik hinsa kii khabaron ko lekar saamaanya hone lage hai
 We do not even know that gradually the number of incidents of these general communal violence has started happening in hundreds to thousands now
 zarur dange jaisi badi ghatnaayen nahin ho rahi hai
 Although a large number of shops have burnt in many places, people have been injured
 
 But the number of communal incidents occurring in thousands is of minor quarrels, which causes a ruckus

 Appu Esthos Suresh, after spending a month, scrutinized all the records and published a long report on October 17 and 18
 teesraa hissaa 19 aktubar ko bhi prakashit hoga
 Appu has stated that around 31 July 2014, not one but nine districts of Uttar Pradesh have recorded an incident of communal violence simultaneously
 aaj se do saal pehle
 The comments aaj ham appu se hi baat karenge, lekin unki report kii khaas baton ko aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 i was also shocked to see a record of 75 districts
 kya ham itane laachaar ho gaye hai ki is tarah hazaron kii sankhya main sampradayik ghatnaayen hoti rahengi or sab kuch raajnneetik dalon par chhod diya jayega, jinaki dilchaspee iskaa phayda uthaane main hi adhik hoti he
 When will there be a voice from within the society
 baharhaal appu kii research bataati he ki
 
 
 There have been 12,000 incidents of communal violence in UP between January 2010 and 2016
 saal ke hisaab se har saal 2,000 sampradayik ghatnaayen
 More than five communal incidents every day by day
 sirf ek din koi sampradayik hinsa darj nahin hui he or wo he 25 disambar 2014
 Between January and April, there were 1,262 communal incidents in 2016
 2015 main 3,708 maamle darj hue hai or 2014 main 2,884
 Why are these sporadic incidents of communal violence continuously increasing
 12,000 kii sankhya sunne ke baad bhi kya hamen in ghatnaon ko chhitput kahana chahie
 Appu has used the terms low intensity community for these events
 sthaneey str par ye tanaav hote hai
 Police overcomes before turning into riots
 ye aankade bataa rahe hai ki sampradayik ghatnaon kii sankhya badhati hi ja rahi he
 
 magar shaayad ye bhi bataa rahe hai ki police kaabo bhi kar paa rahi he
 Otherwise, you cannot rule out the possibility of any of them turning into big fights
 par kya police kaa kaabo paanaa hi kaaphi hoga
 In these cases, the story of the investigation and the outcome of the cases can also bring the promptness of the police in question
 iskaa ye bhi matlab he ki raajnneetik agenciyaan sampradayik tanaav kii in ghatnaon ko ek ranneeti ke tahat anjaam de rahi hai
 When people know why people are dividing
 appu ne graphics ke zariye apni report main bataaya he ki
 
 
 How is the number of communal incidents related to beef or cow slaughter increasing
 
 In 2010, only 130 cases are reported for these reasons, which goes up to 458 in 2014
 2015 main darj 3,708 ghatnaon main se 696 ghatnaayen bif yaa gohatya ko lekar hoti hai
 In the same way, quarrel over the graveyard, temple-mosque and religious events also played a role
 appu ne is sabko dharmik ashishnutaa ke mad main jod diya he
 In 2010, out of 592 communal violence incidents due to religious intolerance, 98 occur
 2014 main 2,884 main se 715 ghatnaayen dharmik ashishnutaa ke kaaran hoti hai
 Out of 3,708 incidents in 2015, 905 incidents are due to religious intolerance
 abhi hamane bataaya ki 2015 main upi main sampradayik hinsa kii 3,708 ghatnaayen darj huin
 Of these, 1,600 incidents have occurred over beef or religious intolerance
 inkaa makasad saaf he ki tanaav ho magar bade str par danga na bhadke
 The tension is that there is a heated debate in the local area that they are like this
 
 They are like this
 bahes karte-karte aap logon kii sampradayik khmebandi hone lagati he
 Except for the question of bread and cloth and job, you start making political choices based on these questions
 jabaki in ghatnaon kaa kaaran dekhen to saamaanya janata se ummid kii jaani chahie ki wo koob hanse or kahe ki pataa he ki aisa hi hota he, magar ham jhagada nahin karenge
 Nasiruddin Haider Khan is another journalist like Appu
 inhone www
 youthkiawaaz
 com par ek lekh likhaa he
 We have compiled news reports of communal violence on 13 newspapers and websites in English and Hindi, which we call sporadic violence
 isi 11 se 15 aktubar ke bich uttar pradesh or bihar main durga murti visarjan or taziye ke juluus ke dauraan takaraav kii itani ghatnaayen hui hai ki aap shaayad chaunke bhi na, kyonki ham or aap saamaanya ho chuke hai
 Nasiruddin wrote that
 
 
 gonda main durga pratimaa ke visarjan ke dauraan patharav kaa aarope laga
 If the tension increased, the Tazia Committee did not remove Tazia
 mau main bhi pratimaa visarjan or tazia tode jane ko lekar tanaav hua
 Tension prevailed over the burning of Ravana on the cemetery land in Aligarh
 muradabad main bilari ilaake main muharram ke dauraan ek juluus nikaalane ko lekar tanaav ho gaya
 On 13, 14 and 15 October, there was tension in Moti Ganj, Gonda, Fakharpur of Bahraich
 baharich main kai jagahon par aisi ghatnaayen hui hai
 Nasir has written that there has been tension over the procession route in Maharajganj, Kushinagar, Ballia, Balrampur, Bareilly, Sitapur and Rae Bareli
 bihar main to chunaav bhi nahin hone vaale hai, lekin vahaan ye tanaav kyon ho rahe hai
 Communal tension also increased in Turkoulia of East Champaran in Bihar
 yaheen ke sugauli main bhi isi tarah kaa maamla hua
 There was also tension in a locality in Bettiah, West Champaran
 gaya, madhepura, bhojpur, pero, gopalganj, sitamarhi se bhi aisi khabaren ain hai
 Even after the year and the place has changed, there is a similarity in the causes of stress
 kya vaaki ham in kaarnon ko nahin samajhate hai yaa jo log sangathit tareeke se donon taraf se in maamalon ko anjaam dete hai, unhen logon par puraa bharosa he ki log bhadakenge hi
 For the same reasons, people raged in 1940, raged in 1960 and in 2016
 kya sabakuch itnaa fiks ho saktaa he
 Our today's guest journalist fellow published a similar report from Bihar last year
 do maheene lagaakar appu ne 38 zilon kaa police record dekha tha
 He was then in the Indian Express and now in the Hindustan Times
 appu ne bataaya tha ki
 
 
 The number of incidents of communal violence in Bihar has increased to 667 in the months preceding the June 2013 elections
 june 2013 se 2010 ke bich aisi ghatnaon kii sankhya 226 hi thi
 There is also a pattern in these incidents that in many places the local media does not give them coverage
 rashtriya media bhi andekha karata he
 As it is being debated in Bengal that by taking advantage of this, communal gangs start spreading rumors that the media is favoring any one community
 ab dekhnaa hoga ki media kaa yah faisla swavivek ke aadhaar par he yaa kawarej na karne kaa faisla sampradayik ranneeti se mail khaataa he taaki iskaa laabh uthaakar afvaah failaane kaa mauka mili
 In many places, the media's direct role in spreading the rumor has emerged
 aapako internet par isse sambandhit kai shodhaparak lekh milenge
 The English newspaper Hindustan Times has studied the police records of the communal incidents taking place in Uttar Pradesh
 ek maheenaa lagaakar appu esthos suresh ne tamaam record kii chaanbin kii he or ise 17 or 18 aktubar ke din ek lambii rapat prakashit kii he
 The third part will also be published on 19 October
 appu ne bataaya he ki 31 july 2014 ke aasapaas uttar pradesh ke ek nahin balki nau zilon main ek saath sampradayik hinsa kii ghatana darj kii gai he
 Two years before today
 tippaniyan Today we will talk to Appu only, but i want to put the special things of his report in front of you
 75 zilon kaa record dekhakar main bhi chaunk gaya
 Have we become so helpless that in such a way thousands of communal incidents will happen and everything will be left to the political parties, who are more interested in taking advantage of it
 samaaj ke bheetar se kab awaz uthegi
 Appu's research, however, states that
 
 
 upi main janvari 2010 se 2016 ke bich sampradayik hinsa kii 12,000 ghatnaayen hui hai
 2,000 communal incidents every year by year
 din ke hisaab se har din paanch se adhik sampradayik ghatnaayen
 There is no communal violence recorded on just one day and that is 25 December 2014
 saal 2016 main janvari se april ke bich 1,262 sampradayik ghatnaayen darj hui hai
 3,708 cases have been reported in 2015 and 2,884 in 2014
 sampradayik hinsa kii in chhitput ghatnaon main lagaataar vruddhi kyon ho rahi he
 Even after hearing the number of 12,000, should we call these incidents sporadic
 appu ne in ghatnaon ke liye lo intencity communal shabd istemaal kiye hai
 These stresses occur locally
 dangon main badalane se pehle police kaabo paa leti he
 These figures show that the number of communal incidents is increasing
 
 But perhaps they are also telling that the police is also able to control it
 varna inamen se kisi ke bhi bade jhagade main badalane kii sambhaavna se aap inkaar nahin kar sakate
 But will the police have enough control? in maamalon main jaanch or mukademon ke anjaam kii kahani bhi police kii mustaidi ko sawaalon ke ghere main laa sakati he
 It also means that political agencies are executing these incidents of communal tension as a strategy
 log jab jaanate hai to log bant kyon rahe hai
 Appu has stated in his report through graphics
 
 
 bif yaa gohatya ko lekar hone vaali sampradayik ghatnaon kii sankhya kaise bad rahi he
 
 2010 main in kaarnon se sirf 130 maamle darj hote hai, jo 2014 main 458 ho jate hai
 Out of 3,708 incidents recorded in 2015, 696 incidents related to beef or cow slaughter
 usee tarah se qabristaan ko lekar jhagada, mandir-masjid or dharmik aayojanon kii bhi bhoomika rahi he
 Appu has added all this to the item of religious intolerance
 2010 main dharmik ashishnutaa ke kaaran 592 sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon main se 98 ghatnaayen hoti hai
 In 2014, 715 out of 2,884 incidents are due to religious intolerance
 2015 main 3,708 ghatnaon main se 905 ghatnaayen dharmik ashishnutaa ke kaaran hoti hai
 We have just reported that in 2015, there were 3,708 incidents of communal violence in UP
 inamen se 1,600 ghatnaayen bif yaa dharmik ashishnutaa ko lekar hui hai
 Their motive is clear that there is tension but do not provoke riots on a large scale
 tanaav se hota yah he ki sthaneey ilaake main garmagarm bahes hone lagati he ki wo aise hai
 
 ye aise hai
 While arguing, the communal camp of you people starts
 roti-kapadaa or naukari ke sawaal ko chhod aap in sawaalon ke aadhaar par raajnneetik pasand banane lagate hai
 While seeing the cause of these incidents, it should be expected from the general public that they laughed and said that it is known that this happens, but we will not quarrel
 appu kii tarah ek or patrkaar hai nasiruddin haidar khan
 He www
 youthkiawaaz
 has written an article on com
 angrezi or hindi ke 13 samachar patron or website par chhapi sampradayik hinsa kii khabaron kaa sankalan kiya he, jinhen ham chhitput hinsa kehete hai
 During the procession of Durga idol immersion and refreshment in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar between October 11 and 15, there have been so many incidents of conflict that you may not even be shocked because we and you have become normal
 nasiruddin ne likhaa he ki
 
 
 During the immersion of the Durga statue in Gonda, there was a charge of stone pelting
 tanaav badha to tazia cameti ne tazia nahin nikaala
 In Mau too, there was tension over the immersion of the statue and the breaking of the taziya
 aligarh main kabristaan kii zamin par ravan jalaane ko lekar tanaav failaa
 During the Muharram in Bilari area in Moradabad, there was tension over a procession
 13, 14 or 15 aktubar ko gonda ke motiganj, baharich ke fairpur main tanaav hua
 Such incidents have happened in many places in Bahraich
 nasir ne likhaa he ki maharajaganj, kushinagar, baliya, balrampur, bareli, sitapur or raibareli main bhi juluus ke raste ko lekar tanaav hua he
 Elections are not going to be held in Bihar either, but why are these tensions happening there
 bihar ke purvi champaran ke turakuliya main bhi sampradayik tanaav bad gaya
 a similar case occurred in Sugauli here
 pashchim champaran ke betia ke ek mohalle main bhi tanaav ho gaya
 Gaya, Madhepura, Bhojpur, Piro, Gopalganj, Sitamarhi have also been reported
 saal or jagah badal jane ke baad bhi tanaav ke kaarnon main gazab kii samanta he
 Do we really not understand these reasons or people who carry out these matters from both sides in an organized manner, they have full faith in the people that people will flare up
 inhen kaarnon se log 1940 main bhi bhadke the, 1960 main bhi bhadke or 2016 main bhi bhadakenge
 Can everything be so fixed? hamaare aaj ke mehmaan patrkaar saathi ne pichley saal bihar se ek aisi hi report prakashit kii thi
 Appu took two months to see the police records of 38 districts
 tab ve indian express main the or ab hindustan times main hai
 Appu had told that
 
 
 june 2013 ke chunaav se pehle ke maheenon tak bihar main sampradayik hinsa kii ghatnaon kii sankhya badhkar 667 ho gai he
 Between June 2013 and 2010, there were only 226 such incidents
 in ghatnaon main ek pattern yah bhi dikh rahaa he ki kai jagahon par sthaneey media inhen kawarej nahin detaa
 The national media also ignores
 jaisaa ki bengal main ise lekar bahes ho rahi he ki iskaa laabh uthaakar sampradayik giroh afvaah failaane lagate hai ki media kisi ek samudaay kaa paksh le rahaa he
 It remains to be seen whether this decision of the media is on the basis of discretion, or the decision not to do coverage matches the communal strategy to take advantage of it and spread the rumor
 kai jagahon par afvaah failaane main media kii sidhi bhoomika saamne ai he
 You will find many research articles related to this on the Internet
 aaj ham appu se hi baat karenge, lekin unki report kii khaas baton ko aapke saamne rakhana chahta hum
 i was also shocked to see a record of 75 districts
 kya ham itane laachaar ho gaye hai ki is tarah hazaron kii sankhya main sampradayik ghatnaayen hoti rahengi or sab kuch raajnneetik dalon par chhod diya jayega, jinaki dilchaspee iskaa phayda uthaane main hi adhik hoti he

 This unique 77 cars costing only Rs

 ye kaaren 2010 kii shuruyaat main banakar taiyaar ho gai thim lekin inke silencer ke rabar parts main kharabi aa jane ke kaaran sadak par na utar sakin
 The uk-based Aston Martin headquarters contacted all the major automobile companies abroad but their equipment could not run this James Bond car
 silencer ke rabar parts nirmaataaon kii badi shiddat se khoj main juty eston martin company kaa sitambar, 2010 main lakhanu kii chopra ritek rabar products limited ke emdi kiran chopra se sampark hua
 After a few months of effort, the rubber equipment manufactured by Kiran's company fit into Aston Martin's Model One-77, and these expensive luxury 77 cars raced the streets
 lakhanu ke gokhale maarg nivasee kiran chopra us parivaar se taalluk rakhte hai jo aazaadee se pehle pakistan ke peshawar main automobile ke vyapaar main agrani tha
 They had agency ranging from Rolls Royce to Ambassador
 desh ke bantwaare ke baad inkaa parivaar bharat aa gaya
 Here too, he started doing business of selling vehicles
 haalanki kiran ke pita je
 C
 chopra ke man main kuch or hi chal rahaa tha
 He wanted to move away from the business of vehicles to try his hand in the field of construction
 iske liye unhone lakhanu main eshbagh ke talkatoraa main rabad kii ek choti-si factory kharidi or gadipoon main lagane vaale rabar ke parts banane shuru kiye
 Kiran, who was studying at St
 Francis College in Lucknow at that time, had a special interest in rubber technology
 1973 main grajuation karne ke baad unhone vishwa vikhyath landan college of rabar technology main daakhila liya
 Kiran topped the college during two years of studies
 iskaa phayda yah hua ki unhen vishwa kii agrani companiyon main rabar technolaji main prashikshan paane kaa mauka mila
 This boosted his confidence and when Kiran came back to Lucknow after completing his studies, he persuaded his father that if the business had to move forward, it would have to be extended to abroad
 yaheen se ek nai shuruyaat hui
 Kiran explains, "I thought that if we achieved success there, which is the most difficult market, then we will dominate the world
" ” chunki un dinon bhi automobile ke kshetra main germany agrani tha isliye kiran ne german ejineering par dhyaan lagaaya
 Germany held the world's largest automobile fair in September every year
 1977 main kiran vahaan gaye, gadibhan dekhin lekin ve duvidha main the
 He explains, "I thought that our company's business would only grow when we make parts that go bad again and again
" ye ve part honge jo gaadi ke neeche lage honge
 "kiran inspected the bottom of a car and found that the smoke-emitting silencer is fitted with a lot of rubber parts that prevent its vibration from spreading in the car
 us vakt antarrashtriya bazaar main teen gadibhan marcides-banj, foxwagon or general motors kii opel zyada bikati thim
 Kiran came to Lucknow with samples of the rubber parts of the silencers of these vehicles and after a year of hard work, made the rubber parts exactly like that
 is baar germany ke automobile meley main ek stall lagaakar lakhanu ke bane in parts kaa pradarshan kiya gaya
 He noticed the attention of the car makers but they could also be made in India, there was doubt about it
 kiran bataate hai, “hamane nai kaaron ke liye rabar parts banane par focus nahin kiya kyonki lakhanu main baithkar in badi companiyon kii demand puri nahin kii ja sakati thi
 We caught the market of parts replacement
 matlab nai gadipoon ke patters kharaab hone par jab ve badale jaaen to vah hamaara hi lage
 "ritek, owner of the" retake company "at the German automobile fair, liked Kiernan's equipment
 kuch dinon baad ve kiran kii factory dekhne lakhanu bhi aae or bharosa hone par silencer ke do lakh rabar parts banane kaa order diya
 For the first time, not only Lucknow, any construction company in the country had received such a large order from a foreign company
 kiran ne bank se udhaar lekar apana order puraa kiya
 Since these parts were of world-class quality, Lucknow replaced the silencer replacement rubber parts market among the world's most famous vehicles
 germany ke alaava america ke bazaar main bhi in upkarnon kii maang badi
 Seeing this, Kiran's company became the leader of the replacement market but this situation could not last long
 assi ke dashak main rupaya majboot ho rahaa tha or ab videshi companiyon ko bharat se vyapaar karnaa ghate kaa sauda mahasoos hone laga
 The situation became such that by 1985, Kiran had to close the factory to manufacture rubber parts
 kuch dinon baad ise bechakar kiran duusare vyavsaayon main dhyaan lagane lage
 a computer education center opened in Lucknow by the name of "BITS", which gained a lot of fame among the students
 saat saal baad 1992 main jab rupaya dollar ke mukaable kaaphi kamjor hua to halaat phir badale
 It was beneficial for foreign companies to do business with India
 ek baar phir ritek company ke maalik ne kiran se sampark kiya
 Now a new company, Chopra Retech Rubber Products Limited, was formed
 lakhanu main chinahat ke deva road par band padi ek factory kharidi gai
 New machines were purchased and started functioning within a year and a half
 teen se chaar saal ke bheetar chopra-ritek kii jugalbandi ne europe main silencer ke rabar parts ke bazaar par apana kabja jamaa liya
 Seven years later, Kiran started making rubber bush for suspension of foreign cars in Lucknow itself, which became popular in the market
 aaj sthiti yah he ki videshi kaaron ke silencer ke rabar parts bechney vaali sabase badi company “tenneco” or suspension ke rabar parts kii supplaai karne vaali sabase badi company “federlamogal” kii lakhanu kii chopra ritek rabar products limited sabase badi or pasandida saplir he
 With Kiran Chopra Fakhr says, "our company imports are zero and exports are hundred percent
 ” itnaa hi nahin, 1960 se lekar ab tak duniya main bani sabhi kaaron ke silencer ke rabar parts lakhanu kii is company ke paas maujuud hai jo kahin or nahin hai

 chandigarh police ko badi kamyaabi mili he
 Chandigarh Police has solved the case of murder of two real sisters living in PG
 is maamle main chandigarh police ke ritred sab inspector ke bete ko giraftaar kiya gaya he

 aaropee kuldeep mritka ke saath sambandh tuutane se naaraaz tha
 The police have claimed confession by the accused

 Politics has also started in Punjab when Langar and Prasad come under the purview of GST
 darasal ab tak lungar or prasad ke liye kharide jane vaale kachche saamaan par kisi bhi tarah kaa koi waite yaa anya tex nahin lagata tha, lekin 1 july se jiesti lagu hone ke baad ab lungar or prasad banane ke liye kharide jane vaale rashan or anya saamaan par jiesti lagu ho gaya he
 For this reason, it has become expensive to make langars and offerings in all the gurdwaras within the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, the organization that runs the Golden Temple and Sikh Gurdwaras in Amritsar
 kisi phaayde ke liye nahin chalaaya jaataa lungaraisi baat ko lekar shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti ne punjab or centre sarkaar se lungar or prasad banane ke liye kharide jane vaale saamaan ko jiesti se chhot dene kaa nivedan kiya he
 But nothing has been said so far about this exemption from the government
 isi vajah se esajipisi ke pradhan kripal singh baduunger ne kaha ki swarna mandir or anya gurudwaron main 24 ghante lungar kii suvidha rahati he or bina kisi dharm-jati ke bhedbhaav ke vahaan par bina koi paise liye har aane vaale vyakti ko lungar or prasad diya jaataa he
 In such a situation, it has become very difficult for Gurudwaras to operate langars and the gurdwaras run the langars only from the donations and not for any benefit or benefit
 aise main langaron ke liye kharide jane vaale saamaan ko jiesti main raahat di jaani chahie
 Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has also demanded the exclusion of community eateries like Prasad and Langar offered at various religious institutions from GST
 mukhyamantri ne sikh gurudwara prabandhak cameti or anya logon va sansthaanon kii apil par kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ko patr likhakar in saamaanon ko vastu evam seva kar se baahar karne kii maang kii he
 CM Amarinder's letter to Jaitley Amarinder in his letter reminded Jaitley that the gurudwara was exempted from payment of VAT for providing food at the langar
 lekin nai jiesti pranali ke tahat is par kar kaa bhugtan karnaa he or saath hi prasad briki par bhi kar dena he
 Due to this, all religious institutions, temples, gurudwaras, mosques and churches are being affected
 dharmik sansthaanon dwaara kharide gaye saamaanon par jisti karadhaan sahi nahin he kyonki in kendron kaa koi aay kaa strot nahin he or inhen daan main mili dhan se chalaaya jaataa he
 He requested Jaitley to reconsider the case and demanded that all religious institutions be exempted from GST
 isamen naa sirf prasad kii kharid or bikri par balki lungar main bhi kharide jane vaale saamaanon ko jiesti mukt karne kii maang kii gai he
 Earlier, the state government itself gave relief, on this issue, the Akali Dal reminded the Punjab government that the member of the GST Council, the GST Council, which has bought the goods to be purchased for anchor and prasad, is the Finance Minister of Punjab, Manpreet Badal
 Even then, why did not he try to keep all the material purchased for anchor and offerings at the same time out of the purview of GST
 
 saath hi rajya sarkaron ke paas sansthaaon ko 66 pratishat tak jiesti main chhot dene kaa adhikaar he to kyon nahin punjab sarkaar khud hi pahal karti or esajipisi ko lungar ke liye kharide jane vaale saamaan main 66 fisadi jiesti kii raahat detii
 After this, there should be an attempt to remove GST from the central government
 akali dal ke pradhan sukhbir badal ne kaha ki wo is mudde par akali dal ke delygation ko lekar vitt mantri arun jetali se milenge or esajipisi jaisi anya dharmik sansthaaon ko lungar or prasad chalaane ke liye jiesti se raahat dene kii maang karenge
 The AAP also talked about relief from GST
 Aam Aadmi Party has also demanded to keep the items and materials to be purchased for the anchorage of gurdwaras outside the purview of GST
 aam aadmi party ke punjab ke senior leader sukhpal khehara ne kaha ki dharmik sansthaanon ke lungar or khaas taur par swarna mandir or anya gurudwaron ke andar bina kisi bhedbhaav ke har dharm ke vyakti ko khaanaa parosa jaataa he or ye lungar koi kamai kaa jariya nahin he balki dharmik shraddha or sadbhaav kaa pratik he
 In such a situation, these langars should get relief from GST in every situation and the Punjab government should first try to give relief from GST at its own level and then try to get relief from the central government as well
 centre sarkaar kii taraf se koi jawaab nahinjiastilagu hone ke baad se hi shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti lagaataar ye maang uthaa rahi he ki gurudware main lungar ke liye kharide jane vaali tamaam saamagree or vastuon par jiesti lagu nahin hona chahie lekin ab tak centre sarkaar kii taraf se chhot dene kii koi bhi baat saamne nahin ai he or isi vajah se ab ye mudda ek bade raajnneetik mudde main tabdeel hota ja rahaa he
 Did Cambridge Analytica, a foreign company surrounded by allegations of having an impact on elections in the country by accessing Facebook data of Indians, lied to the Modi government last year? This question arose on Wednesday when the government said that Cambridge Analytica had said that no Indian has data, whereas Facebook had told the government that Analytica has data of more than five lakh Indians
 loksabhaa main buudhvaar ko ek sawaal ke likhit jawaab main sarkaar ne fasebuk or cambridge analitica ke virodhabhasi daavon kii jaankaree di he
 The government has again issued notices to both companies to investigate the claims of who is telling the truth
 darasal, karnataka ke bhaajapa saansad anant hegade ne buudhvaar ko soshal media plateform se data chori ko lekar sarkaar se kai sawaal karne ke saath poocha tha ki ise rokane ke liye kya kadam uthaae ja rahe hai
 In a written reply to this question, Information and Technology Minister Sanjay Dhotre said that the government had issued a notice to the company after the news of Cambridge Analytica interfering in the Indian elections last year
 teen april 2018 ko cambridge analitica ne bataaya ki uske paas bharatiyon kaa koi fasebuk data nahin he
 On the contrary, Facebook told the Government of India on April 5, 2018 that Cambridge Analytica has accessed data of about 562,455 Indians through the installed app
 mantri ne bataaya ki donon companiyon ke paraspar virdohi daavon ke baad sarkaar ne phir se unhen notice jari kar tasviir saaf karne ko kaha
 However, the Minister did not say in written reply what further information the two companies gave
 If sensitive information related to a person is leaked then the victim has the right to get compensation

 or ye koshish he ek audio massej kii surat main, jise bagdadi ne maidan-e-jang main peeth dikhaa kar bhaagate apane sipahasalaron ko hausala dene ke liye release kiya he
 Baghdadi is terrified of a bitter defeat
 The audio message of this audio message is like, 'rest assured that Allah will bless every person who will pray for him
 itmeenaan rakho ki tum ye jarur sunoge ki hamaari state bilkul thik he
 The more attacks against us, the more we will be Pakistan and our unity will increase
 ham vaada karte hai ki jo bhi iesas ke khilaaf is jang main bhaag le rahaa he, wo chaahe america ho, rus ho, isroyal ho yaa phir europe ho, har kisi ko isaki keemat chukaani hogi
 They have to regret it
 ' lekin bagdadi kii gidadbhabhaki or iesas kii tamaam dhamkiyon ke bich ab sabase acchhee khabar ye he ki aamane-saamne kii ladaai ke baad ab iraq main iesas ko karaari shikast mili he
 The voice of Baghdadi is not confirmed
 Ramadi, an important city of Iraq's uncontaminated province, has now left ISIS
 wo ramaadi shahar, jis par iesas ne may 2014 yani pichley dedh saal se kabja kar rakhaa tha
 However, amid this new news of the Iraqi army occupying Ramadi, intelligence and security agencies have not yet been able to confirm whether the voice released through Twitter accounts is of Baghdadi
 lekin jaankaar ise bagdadi kii ghabrahat ke taur par jarur dekh rahe hai
 Actually, what happened in Iraq on Sunday had never happened in recent times
 america kii aguwai main colision forcej iesas ke thikaanon par hamale to kar hi rahi thi, america se hi training hasil karne ke baad iraq kii sarkari fouj ne bhi rajdhani baghdad ke pashchimi hisse main based is shahar main iesas ke hosh thikaane laga die
 Troubled by the dual ground-air raid, Iraqi troops clashed with militants in many parts of Baghdadiramadi, but the recent attacks by NATO countries fighter jets did not allow the terrorists to hide
 
 or ravivaar ko jab iraq kii fouj provential government complex par kabje ke liye aage badi, to puri kii puri imaarat aatankwaadiyon se khaali ho chuki thi
 However, the army taught a lesson to the aces and terrorists who had survived earlier
 shanivaar ko hauj ilaake main aamane-saamne kii ladaai main fouj ne iesas ke 12 aatankwaadiyon kii laashen bicha deen or bahut si aisi gadiyon ko bamon se uda diya, jinka istemaal aatankwaadi aage hamalon ke liye karanevaale the
 Counter-terrorism spokesman Al Noman said, "we launched a two-sided attack on ISIS
 jameen par ham aamane saamne kii ladaai kar rahe the or aasmaan se air force or colision deshon ne unke thikaanon par hamale kiya
 We killed 12 terrorists and destroyed their vehicles
 ramaadi main jab ham sarkari imaarat par kabje ke liye pahunche, tab tak imaarat aatankwaadiyon se khaali ho chuki thi
 'of course, it should be true that a large area of iraq is still under the control of terrorists, but the dismantling of ISIS on Ramadi is seen as a good start
 chaaron ore se ghir chukaa iesas kaa sargana abu bakar al bagdadi beshak nae audio ke jariye khud ko bekhauf or bephikr sabit karne kii koshish kar rahaa he, lekin hakeekat yahi he ki ab use jaan ke laale pad gaye hai
 He is running away from the tail
 kabhi iraq, kabhi syria to kabhi libya
 According to experts, the front of all the countries of the world has opened up against the Islamic State from Iraq to Syria, it seems that in the coming few months, ISIS can be eliminated
 or aise main bagdadi ke paas ab bhaagane ke alaava koi chaara hi nahin bachaa he
 The news is that Baghdadi has now fled to Libya after weakening in Iraq and Syria
 irani samachar agency FARC ke mutabik bagdadi siraaya se rakka se bhaag libya pahunch gaya he
 He is seen in the city of Sirte, Libya
 sirte abhi bhi libya main iesas kaa garh bana hua he or jaan bachaane ke liye bagdadi ko isse surakshit koi duusari jagah philhal najar nahin aa rahi he
 This situation of Baghdadi is also because most of its trusted warlords have been killed in both Iraq and Syria
 iraq main oktober maheene main apane kafile par hue hamale main bhi bagdadi buree tarah zakhmi ho gaya tha
 After which he also had to undergo his surgery in the city of Raqqa, Syria
 lekin chunki vahaan ilaaj kaa intjaam sahi nahin tha, wo chhipate-chhipate turki pahunchaa tha
 But it is said that as soon as the intelligence agencies got the idea of his being in Turkey, he fled from Turkey to Libya
 bagdadi kis tarah lagaataar apana thikaana badal rahaa he, iskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki janvari main uske iraq main hone kii khabar thi, to june main syria ke rakka main
 In October, he was again in Iraq, while after the attack he reached Syria and then hid in Libya via Turkey

 Here, Union Minister of State for Railways Manoj Sinha has said that the local administration did not inform the railway department about the program
 unhone kaha ki agar railway ko jaankaree di jaati to unke vibhaag kii ore se guidelins nishchit rup se jari kiye jate

 Surjewala tweeted that 50 mps are needed to get impeachment, which we have completed
 rajyasabha chairman prastaav kii merit tay nahin kar sakate hai
 Now this fight is directly between those who save democracy and those who reject democracy
 Constitutional process of impeachment is set in motion with 50 mp’s giving the motion
 RS Chairman can't adjudge the motion, for he has no mandate to decide the merits of the motion
 This is truly a fight between forces ‘rejecting Democracy’ & voices ‘rescuing Democracy’

 jo ki rajyasabha chairman ke faisle ko prabhavit karne vaala bayaan tha
 The Rajya Sabha chairman cannot take such a decision in the absence of administrative power
 2 / 3within hours of 64 mp’s submitting the impeachment motion, Leader of Rajya sabha(fm) had expressed naked prejudice by calling it a ‘revenge petition’ virtually dictating the verdict to Rajya Sabha Chairman on that day

 Controversy has arisen over the vulgar comments of the show
 bhashaa se input In the politics of Haryana, once the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) spoke
 rajya main satta ke singhaasana par virajman hone se lekar desh ke uppradhanmantri kaa safar tay karne vaale choudhary devilal ne inelo kii neenv rakhi thi
 Which was further promoted by his son Om Prakash Chautala and succeeded in becoming the Chief Minister of Haryana three times
 kisi ne sochaa bhi nahin hoga ki ek din haryana main inelo ko apane astitv ko bachaane ke liye jaddojahad kerani padegi
 In the early stages, nobody felt that the INLD was a family party
 lekin devilal kii chauthi peedi ke kadam rakhte hi yah party tuuti or ab puri tarah se bikharaav kii ore agrasar he
 The INLD, which is going through the worst phase in Haryana's politics, seems to be ending now
 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle om prakaash chautaala kii party inelo tuuti or ab vidhansabha chunaav se pehle vidhayak tuutakar duusare dalon kaa daaman tham rahe hai
 Jind bye election started, the continuation of INLD continues
 nunh seat se vidhayak jakir hossain or julanaa se vidhayak parminder singh dhul ne mangalvaar ko inelo chhodkar mukhyamantri manohar laal khatter ke netritv main bijepi kaa daaman tham liya he
 The entry of Zakir Hussain is likely to benefit the BJP in Muslim majority Mewat
 jind ko inelo kaa garh mana jaataa rahaa he, lekin parminder singh dhul ke bijepi kaa daaman tham lene ke baad inelo ko is ilaake main apane vajood bachaae rakhana badi chunauti hogi
 So far, five INLD mlas have joined the BJP, including Dhul and Hussain
 isse pehle barwaala se vidhayak ranbir gangava, hathin se vidhayak shersingh ravat or fatehabad se vidhayak balavaan singh doulatpuria bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 Apart from this, Nasim Ahmad INLD MLA from Mewat area has joined Congress
 yah sabhi vidhayak inelo ke vafaadaar netaa rahe hai, lekin inelo ke kamjor hone ke baad sabhi uskaa saath chhod rahe hai
 Actually, in the 2014 assembly elections of Haryana, BJP got 47 seats, INLD got 19 seats and Congress got 15 seats, but after the merger of Haryana Janhit Congress (HJC) with Congress, Kuldeep Bishnoi and Renuka Bishnoi became Congress MLA and number 17 happened

 After this, the party mlas Naina Chautala, mlas Pirthi Numberdar, Anup Dhanak, Rajbir Fougat split from the party after the INLD split into two factions
 ab mahaj 8 vidhayak bache hai
 As a result, the post of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly has been snatched from the second-ranked party in Haryana

 ek taraf ajay chautaala ne apane donon beton ke saath milakar jananaayak janata party (jejepi) bana lee to duusari taraf abhaya chautaala ne pita ke saath inelo kii kaman apane haath main le lee
 The BSP president Mayawati refused to form an alliance with the INLD after the political split in the Chautala family
 loksabhaa chunaav se ain pehle inelo ke do faad kaa nateeja tha ki inelo or jejepi ek bhi sansadeey seat nahin jeet saki
 Not only this, the fourth generation of Devi Lal Dushyant Chautala and Digvijay Chautala were in the election field from JJP, but Modi could not save his seat in the wave and the INLD could not open its account under the leadership of Abhay Chautala
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main inelo do siten jeetne main kaamyaab rahi thi

 This was the background of the National Executive meeting held on 4 March
 'gandhi ne bataaya, 'dilli ke chunaav prachaar ke dauraan prashanth bhushan ne kai baar dhamkee di thi ki ve party ke khilaaf press conference karenge kyonki unhen ummidavaaron ke chayan par kuch aapatti thi
 Some of us somehow managed to keep him calm till the election

 Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan and Yogendra Yadav had a never-ending feud
 unke bich bharosa bhi bahut kam ho chukaa tha
 'as Gandhi,' Yogendra Yadav said that he can understand that Arvind does not want to see him in PAC, it is difficult to work together so he and Prashant will stay out of PAC but they should not be excluded
 unhone do formule pesh kiye
 -PAC be reorganized and new members are elected
 PAC ke chunaav main prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav apni ummidavaari pesh nahin karenge
 -PAC continues to function in its present form and Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan will not attend any meetings
 mayank gandhi ne buudhvaar ko PAC kii voting main hissaa nahin liya or unhone apane khule khat main isaki vajah bhi bataai he
 He wrote, 'arvind needs to work well in PAC
 isliye main is baat se sahamat hum ki prashanth bhushan or yogendra yadav PAC se baahar rah sakate hai or kuch duusari mahatvapurn bhoomika le sakate hai
 i was opposed to the proposal to keep them out in public and especially when they were willing to withdraw themselves
 unhen hataane kaa ye faisla duniyabar ke kaaryakartaaon kii bhaawanaaon ke khilaaf tha
 i agreed that they could go out of the PAC, but the feeling and manner behind it was not acceptable to me

 is dauraan centre sarkaar ne supreme court main halafanama daakhil kar kaha ki leethal injection ke jariye maut kii sajaa faansee kii tulana main zyada nrushans he
 Therefore, hanging is the best option for capital punishment
 baat den, supreme court ne pichhali sunwaayee main centre sarkaar se poocha tha ki kya sajaa-e-maut main faansee ke alaava koi or vaikalpik tarika bhi ho saktaa he
 After this, the central government has filed an affidavit in SC
 maut kii sajaa main faansee dena behetarcentre sarkaar nesupreme courtmen daakhil apane halafname main kaha ki faansee kii sajaa, maut kii sajaa ke liye jaldi or surakshit tarika he
 Punishing death by lethal injection and firing is inhumane and atrocious
 centre sarkaar ne ye bhi kaha ki faansee kii sajaa keval reerest of rer cese main di jaati he
 So hanging sentence is better
 bataa den, pichhalisunwaayeemen supreme court ne kaha tha ki sajaa-e-maut ke maamle main faansee ke alaava koi doosraa tarika bhi talash kiya jaae, jisamen maut shanti se ho, pidaa main nahin
 For centuries it has been said that there is no equal to a painless death
 aise main vigyaan main ai teji ke chalate maut ke duusare tareeke ko talasha jaae
 Painful way of hanging death: a petition has been filed in the Yachikasupriam court that another alternative should be adopted for capital punishment instead of hanging
 faansee ko maut kaa sabase dardanaak or barbar tarika bataate hue jehar kaa injection lagane, goli maarane, gas chembar yaa bijli ke jatke dene jaisi sajaa dene kii maang kii gai he
 The petition states that death by hanging takes up to 40 minutes, while shooting and death on electric chair takes only minutes

 isi sthaan se headgavar ne apane 17 sahyogiyon ke saath milakar rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii sthapana san 1925 main vijaydashami (dashahara) ke din kii thi
 When Pranab Mukherjee went to the residence of Hedgewar of the Sangh, a very interesting situation happened
 jab pranab mukherjee ko headgavar ke nivas sthaan par headgavar ke kuldevataa ko pushp arpit karnaa tha, to unhone sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat se kaha ki unhone pairon main juute pahane hue hai
 On this, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat told him that the feeling should be good, you should offer flowers, no problem
 uske baad pranab mukherjee ne doctor headgavar ke kuldevataa ko pushp arpit kiya
 After that, Pranab Mukherjee climbed the narrow staircase and went to the second floor at the place where Hedgewar used to have a secret meeting with the volunteers
 vahiin swayamsevakon ko sambodhit karte huepranab mukherjee kaha ki bharat kii takat uski sahishnutaa main nihit he or desh main vividhta kii puja kii jaati he
 Therefore, if an attempt is made to define nationalism with the help of any particular religion, particular province, hate and intolerance in the country, then it will become our national term
 pranab mukherjee ne kaha ki vah is manch se raashtra, rashtrawaad or deshbhakti par apana mat rakhane ke liye bulaae gaye hai
 It is not possible to see these three words separately
 in shabdon ke samajhane ke liye pehle hamen shabdkosh kii paribhaasha dekhne kii jarurat he
 Pranab said that India was a free society and in the past history was directly connected to the Silk Route

 On the question of New India India, which we have been making since 1947, Yashwant Sinha said that we have all been making New India since 1947
 congress, bijepi sabhi apane-apane mutabik desh ko new india banane ke liye kaam karte rahe hai
 Everyone has their own way

 Everyone has their own opinion pita-putr main paariwarik rishta he, lekin saarvajanik jivan main ham apana-apana kaam karenge
 The wife says don't do all this
 jab se bete raajnneeti main aae hai, ham unase sarkaar ke bare main koi baatcheet nahin karte
 Many leaders are scared, they are unable to speak openly, they said that there are many leaders in the party who want to speak against wrong policies
 ve vyaktigat baatcheet main bolte bhi hai, lekin ve bol nahin sakate, ve dare hue hai
 They are not able to protest openly
 vaajapeyi or modi sarkaar kii karypranali main kya antar he, is sawaal par unhone kaha ki iske bare nahin bataa sakate, kyonki ve sarkaar main shaamil nahin hai

 On the issue of the country cannot be silenced because they are saying that they did not get importance in the government, on this question Sinha said, 'I myself had decided that i will not contest the election
 main chunavi raajnneeti se apane ko alag karnaa chahta tha
 i did not do party politics, kept reading, but could not remain silent on the issue of the country
 'chunaav jeetne se sab kuch maaf nahin ho jatasinha ne kaha ki agar koi chunaav jeet jaataa he to uski sari baaten maaf nahin ho jaatin
 Winning elections is one thing, it is another thing to do good for the country
 chunaav jeetne kii daleel tolalu bhidete the
 Modi is not able to run the country! Yashwant Sinha said that it cannot be said that PM Modi is not able to run the country, but if there are problems, then it will have to be questioned

 Not intending to return to politics, if Modi government is being derailed and you raise your voice then your past is questioned, to which Yashwant Sinha said that i am not on the test today
 mere upar desh ne jajment de diya he
 Now i have no desire to enter mainstream politics
 agar raajnneeti se sanyas le letaa hum to bhi desh ke masale par boluungaa
 On the question of whether the Modi government will come in 2019 or not, if he tries to improve by following my advice, then problems can be overcome

 But do not oppose the security interests of the country
 kyonki aapkaa virodh or khabaren antarrashtriya patalon par aatankiyon ko bachaane ke liye istemaal hoti hai
 You should keep in mind that in this insistence of anti-modi opposition, terrorists like Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed are supporting the terrorists

 It is also the effort of the Congress that party leaders and workers are seen sweating more and more on the ground to reach the common people
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi isi mindset ko party main har str par dekhnaa chaahate hai
 a difference has also started to appear since Rahul became the Congress president, which was earlier seen in the party's headquarters at '24, Akbar Road ', which is no longer visible
 adhiktar netaa ab field main edi chotii kaa jor lagaate dikh rahe hai
 The message of the Congress president is clear, who will show it by performing, he will get the reward
 karnataka vidhansabha chunaav kii gahamagahami ke bich hi congress 29 april se ‘mishan 2019’ kaa aagaaj karne ja rahi he

 Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee President Uttam Kumar Reddy says that the state level leadership of the party is assessing the potential of potential candidates in every district through survey and travel
 reddy ke mutabik ve congress adhyaksh se aagrah karenge ki chunaav se chah maheene pehle hi ummidavaaron ke naam ghoshit karne ko hari jhandi dikhaai jaae
 Similarly, Rajiv Satav, party in-charge and MP for Gujarat, says that the strategy has been prepared for the next round of campaign in the state
 saatav ke mutabik beete saal gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main navasarjan yatra ke baad se hi har kaam ko profeshnal dhang se anjaam diya ja rahaa he
 Satava says, 'we have already completed our journey in the state

 We will start the next round of the campaign which will be in the direction of the movement
 logon ko jo mudde pareshaan kar rahe hai, unhen lekar block se lekar vidhansabha str par virodh pradarshan kiye jaaenge
 "yatra" is the new mantra of the Congress
 After the success of Navsarjan Yatra in Gujarat, Rahul Gandhi is trying to reach more and more people in Karnataka through 'jan Ashirwad Yatra'
 isi se prerana lekar pradesh congress cametiyon ke pramukh or anya diggaj netaa 29 april ke baad apni apni yatraaon par niklenge
 In Madhya Pradesh, party veterans are already campaigning before the 'nyaya Yatra'

 Hooda says, 'there is anger among the people over the promises that the BJP did not fulfill
 congress adhyaksh se 29 april ko nirdesh milane ke baad may main panipat se janakranti yatra kii main shuruyaat karuunga
 Efforts will be made to reach as many people as possible
 ’telugana congress pradesh cameti ke adhyaksh uttam kumaar reddy ke mutabik ve rajya main agle maheene se bas se yatra shuru karne ja rahe hai

 Congress unit Kerala unit president MM Hasan is also taking out 'janmochan Yatra' in the state
 is yatra ke jariye kerala main sattarudh left morcha ke saath hi bijepi par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa ja rahaa he
 Venugopal, the party in-charge for Karnataka, says Rahul Gandhi's travel model has yielded very good results
 is tareeke se nunatam kharch main adhiktam jansampark karne main kamyaabi mil rahi he
 This approach is acting as a bridge to reduce the distance not only between the party and the common people but also between the leaders and workers within the party
 sanghathan kii majbootee kaa mishanbijepi apane ‘mishan 2019’ ke liye 2017 se active mod main he
 By setting new targets for Kerala, West Bengal and the Northeast, the BJP is losing hands and feet to strengthen the party there
 isi tarj par congress kii najar bijepi ke garh maane jane vaale rajyon par he
 The Congress will have a special focus on Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, even Maharashtra
 ye bhi ek hakeekat he ki bijepi kii tarah congress ke paas majboot cader nahin he jo booth level par kaam kar sake
 This weakness of the Congress has been considered as one of the main reasons for the defeat in the last several state assembly elections
 yahi vajah he ki congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi kii ore se alag-alag rajyon main apane general (pradesh party pramukh) niyukt karte hue unhen gurumantra bhi diya ja rahaa he ki sanghathan ko majboot banane ke saath booth prabandhan ko sabase zyada ahmiyat di jaani chahie
 Venugopal says that 8 lakh booth level workers of the party have been appointed during the Karnataka assembly elections
 chhattisgarh ke liye party prabharee pi el punia booth level kaaryakartaaon ke liye camp laga rahe hai
 According to Poonia, he has urged the party president to visit the state for dialogue with these booth workers
 punia ne bataaya ki rahul gandhi karnataka chunaav sampann hone ke baad may main chhattisgarh kaa daura karenge
 According to RPN Singh, Congress in-charge for Jharkhand, the party aims to strengthen not only booth level organizations but also other frontal organizations and departments of the party
 gards main badlaavmadhya pradesh or goa main party sanghathan ke netritv main badlaav ke baad congress kii ore se sheeghra hi haryana, uttar pradesh, himachal pradesh or purvottar main bhi pradesh congress cametiyon main sheersh str par badlaav kiye jane vaala he
 Gujarat in-charge Rajiv Satav says that changes are being made from the block to the district level, the state Congress committee level to strengthen the organization
 rahul gandhi kshamtawan yuvaaon ke saath hi samarpit kaaryakarta / netaaon ko sanghathan main tarjeeh dena chaahate hai
 According to highly placed sources, not only the head of the party organization in the states but also in some departments of the party will be changed
 loksabhaa chunaav pehle hote hai to bhi congress kii taiyaarirajasthan, madhya pradesh or chhattisgarh main isi saal november-disambar main vidhansabha chunaav hone nirdhaarit hai
 There are also speculations that Lok Sabha elections can be held with the elections of three states ahead of time
 is par congress netaa punia kaa kahana he ki aisi sthiti agar aati he to congress uskaa saamana karne ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 The party plans to keep itself ready for the Lok Sabha elections along with the assembly elections of the three states
 madhya pradesh congress cameti ke navaniyukt adhyaksh kamalnath ke mutabik pradesh ke liye praathamiktaayen set kar lee gai hai

 'emphasis on national as well as local issues The Congress is working on a strategy to identify national level issues as well as regional and district level issues to surround the Modi government at the Center
 party rashtriya str par kisaanon kii badahaali, badhati berogari, bhrashtachar, dalit utpeedan kii badhati ghatnaon, essi-asti act main badlaav aadi muddon par focus kar rahi he
 The 'save the Constitution' campaign recently launched by Rahul Gandhi can be linked to this
 jharkhand ke liye congress prabharee arpyen singh kehete hai ki rashtriya muddon ke saath sthaneey mudde bhi uthaae jaaenge
 Like how BJP leaders in Jharkhand took possession of tribal land
 saatav ke mutabik logon ko bataaya jayega ki gujarat vikaas model puri tarah fail he or kaise iske jariye chand logon ko hi laabh pahunchaaya gaya
 However, the Congress knows that in the BJP it is a contest between Narendra modi-amit Shah who believes in active politics of '24x7'
 aise main congress kii bhi koshish he ki dhoop ho yaa barsaat, party ke upar se lekar neeche tak netaa or kaaryakarta logon ke bich har vakt maujuud rah kar kaam karen jisase ki congress kii khoi hui janaadhar kii jameen ko dobaaraa waapas paaya ja sake

 ) There are signs of a major reshuffle in Bihar politics just after the Assembly elections in Delhi
 khabaron ke mutabik, oktober-november main vidhansabha chunaav se pehle pradesh kii kaman ek baar phiranitish kumarako saunpi ja sakati he
 It is believed that in this regard, Lalu Prasad has also given a green signal to JDU
 vahiin bijepi netaa susheel kumaar modi ne bhi daawa kiya he ki 15 farvari se pehle jithan ram maanjhi ko hataakar nitish kumaar siem ban sakate hai
 According to the news of English newspaper 'indian Express', JDU President Sharad Yadav met Lalu Prasad recently and considered the current situation
 argedy pramukh lalu prasad ne kaha ki apana netaa chunane kaa adhikaar jediu ko he or unhone party kaa saath isliye diya ki vah 'sampradayik takaton' ko rokna chaahate hai
 Significantly, after leaving the BJP, the RJD supported the JDU government in the state, now both the parties are moving towards the formation of 'janata Dal Parivar' for the assembly elections, while Nitish Kumar after a high vaulted drama Jitan Ram Manjhi was made the Chief Minister of Bihar after resigning from the post of CM, but since then Lal has been asked to run the government from remote and become CM again
 Receiving cradle are within the charge
 duusari ore, beete kuch dinon se maanjhi ke badbolepan or narendra modi ke samarthan main bayaanbaji se bhi jediu sarkaar kii khub kirakiri hui he
 Lalu Prasad did not like Nitish very much at first, but with time or say that the heat of politics has forced this snow to melt too
 donon netaa ab saath manch saajha karne se bhi gurej nahin karte
 In such a situation, Lalu's green flag does not produce any special surprise
 sutron ke hawaale se khabar he ki sharad yadav kii asli pariksha par satta ke pherbadal ko bina kisi shor ke anjaam tak pahunchaana he
 For the past few days, Manjhi has not missed making statements against his 'mentor' Nitish
 maanjhi ne haal hi yah bhi kaha ki aglaa siem koi dalit hi hoga
 In such a situation, persuading Manjhi to step down can prove to be a pudding
 somvaar ko lalu prasad ne nitish kaa paksh rakhte hue kaha, 'unhone ek dalit ko aage badhaane ke liye apana pad choda
 In this case, support is made to Nitish
 ' lalu ne aage kaha ki vah nahin jaanate ki nitish phir se siem bananaa chaahate hai yaa nahin, lekin agar jediu vidhayak dal unhen netaa chunata he to vah unka samarthan karenge
 Senior leader of nitishbjp cannot stay away from power, Sushil Kumar Modi has also claimed that Nitish Kumar can become CM again by removing Jitan Ram Manjhi as Chief Minister by February 15
 susheel modi kii daleel he ki nitish zyada dinon tak satta se dur nahin rah sakate
 There is also a news from the JDU camp that if Kejriwal's government is formed in Delhi, then Modi's opponents will have new energy

 Russian President Vladimir Putin announced 12 nuclear reactors to India on the very first day of his visit to India, the same day oil prices fell below US $ 60, and in the coming days it would reach between 35 and 40 dollars
 have hope
 isse yah parmaanu samjhauta kam aakarshak ho gaya
 It also shows that alternative to molecular energy is not possible in place of petroleum materials for energy related needs
 maujuuda paristhitiyon main, modi ko salaah di jaani chahie ki vah putin se poochhate ki bharat ko aanvik sahyog dene ke bajaay rus bharat ko asian gas or tel samudaay ke network main shumaar karwaane main kis tarah madad kar saktaa he
 But since such a possibility went unnoticed, it needs to be explained
 aanvik urja abhi bharat kii kul urja khapat kaa mahaj 1-2 fisadi hissaa muhaiyaa karaata he, agar bahut zyada ummid se bhi dekhen to ye aankada varsh 2050 tak bhi 6 fisadi se zyada nahin badhane vaala he
 In such a situation, our primary need is not molecular energy, but only energy from fossils
 duusari baat, jis tarah se ham kudankulam main dekh chuke hai ki aanvik sanyantron ke liye jagah talashna hameshaa mushkil bharaa ho saktaa he or yah mushkil aane vaale dinon main badhegi hi
 Nobody is opposing nuclear power right now, but each one of them will oppose the plan to set up a nuclear plant around them
 hamane aisa maharashtra ke jaitapur or pashchim bengal main bhi dekha he
 It is also clear from the example of Fukushima that even a highly developed country like Japan, which has a culture of industrial development and a highly disciplined work force, can also have nuclear accidents, which have a bearing on generations for decades
 aise haadason ke saamne bhopal gas cond ek chota haadasa najar aane lagata he
 This is the reason why all nuclear plants in the country were shut down after the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in the US, and they have been closed for the last four decades
 audyogic rup se duniya ke sabase zyaada viksit deshon main shaamil germany ke paas apana koi jeevashm eendhan bhi nahin he, lekin usne phukushima ke haadase ke baad tay kiya ki vah apane sabhi aanvik sanyantron ko charanbaddh tareeke se band kar degaa, or koi nayaa sanyantr nahin banayega or puri tarah jeevashm eendhan or akshay urja par nirbhar ho jayega
 France is the only country that depends on nuclear power, but has adequate security measures and sufficient gas reserves through the pipeline from Algeria, but for a country like India, 12 new Russian nuclear plants mean death orgy
 The danger is like increasing 12 times
 teesri baat, baraak obama yah saaf kar chuke hai ki america paryaavaran main kisi tarah ke nuksaan kaa khatra desh sweekaar nahin karegaa
 The $ 68 billion in damages had to be paid due to the recent oil mining crisis in the Gulf of Mexico (no human was killed, but some seals had died)
 vahiin bharat saikadon logon kii maut or hajaaron logon ke prabhavit hone ke baad bhi union carbide se mahaj 480 million dollar kaa harjaana vasuul paaya tha
 Despite this, the liability law in the event of a nuclear accident is considered to be quite stringent, even when the only American manufacturer is supplying a nuclear plant in India
 chauthi baat, rus kaa parmaanu samjhauta us vakt saamne aayaa he, jab petroleum ke daam teji se kam ho rahe hai, so, aise main parmaanu urja mahangi dikhne lagi he
 In such a situation, the need is that why should the world oil and gas market prices be stabilized
 chunki rus prakritik tel or gas kaa pramukh utpaadak he, so, aise main modi ko putin se rus se tel or gas sansadhano kii aapurti kii sambhaavnaaon ke bare main baatcheet kerani chahie thi, jo unhone nahin kii
 He should have done this keeping in mind two other aspects
 pehla pahalu to yahi he ki rus main tel or gas sansadhano kaa utpaadan badhane vaala he, kyonki pashchimi rus ke badale ab siberian field se iskaa utpaadan badhane ja rahaa he
 As such, Russians consider Siberia a part of North Asia
 hamen iskaa dhyaan rakhana chahie tha
 Not only this, the island of Sakhalin on which ONGC and bp's plant is being set up is located in Asia, not in European Russia
 itnaa hi nahin, rus kaa abhi bhi petroleum sector par kaaphi gaharaa asar he, visheshkar apane purv sangheey rajyon par - kazakhstan, turkmenistan, uzbekistan or ajarabazan - jinamein tel or gas prachur maatra main uplabdh hai
 It is from these sources that China meets most of its oil and gas needs, but there is still much left
 hamen madhya or uttari asian main tel sambandhi kootneeti main sakriyata se hissaa lenaa chahie
 The possibility of this has also increased, as Western countries have started a bicot of Russian fuels after Russia's dispute with Ukraine
 antarrashtriya bazaar main tel kii girti keemton ke chalate bhi rus ko vishwast saajheedaar talashne kii jarurat he or kai baar bharose par khara utre bharat se behatar koi doosraa saajheedaar ho nahin saktaa
 But it seems that in the talks between Modi and Putin, there was no discussion on petroleum oil
 sirf parmaanu sanyantron par dhyaan kendrit kar modi ne rus ko parmaanu sanyantron ke ek bade bazaar kaa vikalp de diya he, lekin unase na sirf hamaari urja sambandhi jaruratein puri nahin hongi, desh main parmaanu haadason kaa khatra bhi badhegaa
 Indeed, Modi's advisors have to understand the geo-politics of petroleum oil and natural gases
 asia petroleum tel evam prakritik gas kaa sabase bada utpaadak he
 Not only this, it is also the fastest growing market for oil and natural gas, because the fuel appetite for sustainable development is not being named
 iske chalate hi, asian petroleum or gas samudaay banane kii jarurat he
 Establishment of Asian gas grid should be given priority in this
 bharat ke najariye se, aise grid kaa pehla charan bharat or iran ke bich pakistan ke raste yaa samudr ke neeche kii takanic ke raste kaa nirmaan he
 The path under the sea is also possible now
 aisi gas pipeline ko baad main katar or duusare khadi deshon tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 It can be transported to Iraq and can connect a major line with Azerbaijan
 pashchimi gas network kii tarj par hi hamen turkmenistan-afghanistan-pakistan-bharat (tiepiai) pipeline ke nirmaan ko gati deni chahie, jiske liye seemaa nirdhaaran ke saath-saath jaruri raajnneetik ichhashakti kii bhi jarurat he
 If these sources are met then it will be possible to supply more oil and gas to India
 agar is pipeline ko myanmar ke raste dakshin-pashchim china tak pahunchaaen to or bhi phayda hoga
 We can earn more than we have to spend to bring Western and Central Asian gases to India
 is pan-asian project ko badhaava dene ke liye hamen, tiepiai ko uzbekistan, kazakhstan or rus main caspian sagar par sthit asatrakhaan bandargah tak badhaane kii jarurat he
 If Asatrakhan becomes the hub of the proposed Asian gas grid, other countries in Central Asia will be more confident of joining this revolutionary network
 jahaan tak uttar asia kii baat he, siberia yaa saakhlin se bharat tak gas pipeline takneekee taur par sambhav nahin dikhti ho, lekin bharat or korea or bharat or japan ke bich duusari vyavastha sambhav he
 We will supply gas to them from their contracted center in North Asia (sakhalin) and in return we can get LNG from their Indonesia or Australian center
 yah sab hasil karne ke liye, nehruwadi najariye kii jarurat hogi, jise march 1947 main asian relation conference ke bharat main aayojan ke saath nehru ne shuru kiya tha
 We were not even completely independent then
 pracheen kaal se hi asia duniya main maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas kaa netritv karata rahaa he, jabaki europe kaa upniveshwaad mahaj 300 saal pehle shuru hua
 But despite Nehru's 1947 initiative, Asia has been the most divided continent
 isaki vajah thi - upniveshwaad ke jue main vikaas kii raah par hone ke baavjood asia duniya kii badi takaton ke liye khel kaa maidan bana rahaa, khaskar 20veen shatabdi ke uttararddh or 21veen shatabdi main
 This situation must change
 hamen europe se sabak lene kii jarurat he
 How he first created the European Coal and Steel Community, then the European Common Market, followed by the European Community and now the European Union
 haalanki is tarah ke kisi asian union kii baat abhi ek shatabdi yaa usase bhi zyada dur he, lekin ham us lakshya kii ore bad sakate hai, or asian gas grid kii sthapana is disha main pehla kadam ho saktaa he
 The formation of the Asian Oil and Natural Gas Community will be the first step towards the formation of the Asian Union
 lekin bharat yah sab kaise kar paaegaa, jab vah hindutv ko badhaava dete hue hindu raashtra bananaa chahega
 
 
 The How will this happen when the power of the country will be controlled by leaders like Sakshi Maharaj and Sadhvi Jyoti
 
 
 ? kya ham apni videsh niti ke janak ke sapanom ke tahat sabhi najariyon ko shaamil karte hue shuruyaat kar sakate hai
 
 
 The In such a situation, it should not be surprising that Modi would prefer to buy nuclear plants that no one else wants to buy

 Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath has strongly attacked PM Narendra Modi
 empi ke hoshangabad main ek chunavi raily main kamalnath ne kaha ki narendra modi kii maansikta maarane-kaatane kii he
 Let me tell you that earlier in Hoshangabad, PM Narendra Modi had said that the Congress has started dreaming of killing Modi
 congress ummidavaar ke samarthan main yahaan yojit ek sabha main mukhyamantri kamalnath ne kaha, "pradhanmantri modi kehete hai ki congress unhen (modi) maarna chaahati he, pradhanmantri ji ham kahana chaahate hai ki maarane-kaatane kii maansikta congress kii nahin he, yah maansikta to aapaki he, jo aap yah baat kehete hai, ham to chaahate hai ki modi ko ghar bheje, vah aaraam karen, aapane desh kii janata, madhya pradesh kii janata ko paanch saal se thaga he
 Every class is cheated
 "piem narendra modi ne buudhvaar ko hoshangabad ke itarasi main bina naam liye navjot singh sidghu ke vivaadit bayaan kaa jawaab dete hue kaha tha, "congress ke ek bayanveer yahaan aakar kah rahe the ki modi ko aisa chakka maaro ki vah seemaa paar jaakar gire, congress ke log mujhase itani nafrat karte hai ki congress ab modi ko maarane tak ke sapane dekhne lagi he, magar ve bhul rahe hai ki modi kii taraf se madhya pradesh kii janata, hidustan kii janata batig kar rahi he, ab congress waalon ko bataanaa chahie ki ve kis team se khel rahe hai, bharat kii team se yaa pakistan ke saraparaston kii team se, congress yah sab sochi-samajhi ranneeti ke tahat kar rahi he

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special news letters An all-party delegation led by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Viyan will meet Prime Minister Modi today
 yah pratinidhimandal pradhanmantri modi ko rajya se jude vibhinn muddon , khaastaur par vikaas pariyojnaon se avgat karaayega
 This meeting matters a lot because the delegation is going to meet the Prime Minister after a month
 gauratlab he ki maheene bhar pehle pradhanmantri karyaalay (piemo) ne milane kii ijaajat nahin di thi or is mudde kaa lekar ek bada raajnneetik vivaad chhid gaya tha
 Explain that the PMO has rejected Vijayan's request to meet Prime Minister Modi 4 times
 isse pehle 20 march 2017 ko kerala ke siem nemodise milane kaa samay maanga tha
 But even then Vijayan was not allowed to meet Modi
 usase pehle notebandi ke baad 24 november 2016 ko bhi vijayan ne modi se milane kaa samay maanga tha
 The two leaders met in May and July 2016
 jisamen kerala main left or aresas kaaryakartaaon ke bich hinsa jaise kai muddon par charchaa hui thi
 The delegation will also primarily raise the issue of the need to increase Kerala's ration quota, delays regarding the Kanjikod coach factory, the Sabri Rail project and the state recommendations on the Kasturirangan report on the Western Ghats
 sambhddha mantriyon ke alaava vidhansabha main vipakshi netaa ramesh chennithala or vibhinn raajnneetik dalon ke pratinidhi bhi pratinidhimandal main shaamil honge
 An all-party delegation led by Vijayan was not allowed to meet Prime Minister Modi in June
 piemo ne kaha tha ki ve anaaj kota ke mudde par charchaa ke liye khaadya evam jan vitaran pranali mantri ram vilaas paswan se mil sakate hai
 On this, Vijayan strongly criticized the Prime Minister for consistently ignoring Kerala and its demands
 bataa den ki do hafte main do baar vijayan ne modi se milane kaa samay maanga tha, lekin donon hi baar unke anurodh ko thukraa diya gaya
 The Kerala Chief Minister had also alleged that the Center was not keeping the federal structure of the country in mind
 vijayan ne kaha tha ki pradhanmantri kerala ko nazarandaaj kar rahe hai
 Many industries in the state are being shut down due to the Centre's disinterest in Kerala's demands
 unhone kaha tha ki hamen pradhanmantri se milane or unhen apana anurodh saunpane kii jarurat thi, tab hamen aisa nahin karne diya gaya
 Encouraged by the assembly elections in Haryana, the Congress high command has now handed over the decision to former CM Bhupendra Singh Hooda on an alliance with the JJP party in the state
 congress ke ranneetikaar ahamed patel ke ghar par is samay bhupendra singh hooda maujuud hai
 Sources say that on behalf of the Congress, JJP leader Dushyant Chautala has been offered the post of Deputy CM but Chautala is adamant about demanding the post of Chief Minister
 ab sawaal is baat kaa he ki mukhyamantri pad kaa khwab sanjoe baithe bhupendra singh hooda party ke liye kursi qurbaan kar paaenge
 This decision will not be so easy for the party as well as for Hooda himself, because the way the party was in rebellion before the election and due to Hooda's pressure, Ashok Tanwar was replaced and Kumari Selja was made the state president
 vahiin yahaan ek baat yah bhi dhyaan dene vaali he ki bhupendra singh hooda bhi jat netaa hai or dushyant chautaala bhi jat voton par hi daawa karte hai
 In such a situation, how much space the Congress would like to give to Dushyant Chautala in the state would be a matter to be seen
 philhal khabar likhe jane tak bijepi ko phir 42 siten milti jaati dikhaai de rahi hai

 com / pf8w9awshe Once again the threat of terrorist attack on India is in danger
 bheed bhare bazaar, hotel, train or aisi tamaam jagahen jahaan badi taadaad main log maujuud hote hai, aatankwaadiyon ke nishane par hai
 This warning has come from America
 america videsh mantralay ne bharat main rahane vaale apane nagarikon ko chetavanee jari kii he or chaukanna rahane kii salaah di he
 It says that the US government is constantly receiving information that terrorist organizations are preparing to attack in India
 26 / 11 ke baad is saal pune main dhamaakaa karke aatankwaadiyon ne apni taaqat or iraade zaahir kar die hai
 It is also clear from these attacks that terrorists specifically target such places where citizens of America and other Western countries have their presence
 isse pehle america ne 29 janvari ko aisi hi chetavanee jari kii thi
 The US asked for the largest number of accounts, monitoring the perpetrators of hate, hate and terror
 Facebook 5 this year
 4 arab phek acounts ko band kar chukaa he
 The latest report released on Wednesday by the social media platform said that this step has been taken to prevent the rumor and facts from being manipulated
 fasebuk ne kaha he ki ham jhooth or abhadrata failaane vaale acounts kii pahchaan kar unhen block karne kii apni kshamtaaon ko behatar kar rahe hai
 The social media platform said that every day we identify millions of fake accounts through these methods
 fasebuk kaa maananaa he ki phek acounts ke jariye koi vyakti aisa hone kaa dikhaava karata he jo asal main astitv main he hi nahin
 The network has said that it is focusing more on identifying and closing accounts that deceive people for social and political agendas
 detail maangane main america awwalsarkaron kii ore se yugers ke khaaton kii jaankaree maangane par bhi is report main vistrut charchaa kii gai he
 The United States has asked for the maximum information of users, after which India, Britain, Germany and France are the number

 Facebook said that we legally monitor every application made by governments and ensure that it is valid
 report main aatankwaad, ghrinaa, suicide, child porn or drug se sambandhit fasebuk post se nipatane ke tareekon ke bare main bhi jaankaree di gai he
 Facebook said that the technology is not very advanced and mistakes can still occur
 yahi vajah he ki ham zyada nivesh karke apni nitiyon kaa ulanghan karne vaale khaaton ko hataa rahe hai or khud ko lagaataar sateek banane kii disha main aage bad rahe hai
 The new constitution came into effect in Nepal on Sunday
 haalanki vahaan kii sansad ne hindu raashtra ke prastaav ko sire se khaarij kar diya lekin is samvidhan ke lagu hone ke pehle se chal rahaa virodh, iske lagu hote hi or bhi mukhar ho gaya
 There were reports of violent clashes from the Terai areas adjoining India
 is baat kii ashanka lagaataar bani hi hui thi
 Madhesi has also consistently opposed this constitution because he feels that he has been discriminated against in this constitution
 yahi vajah he ki samvidhan lagu hone ke thik do din pehle bharat ke grih sachiv es jaishankar nepal gaye
 There, he not only met the leaders of different parties but also met Prime Minister Sushil Koirala
 jaishankar ne kaha ki bharat nae samvidhan ke haq main he or ummid karata he ki nepal ke netaa is maamle main itnaa lacheelaapan or paripakvata dikhaaenge ki samvidhan sabko saath lekar chalane vaala or sabko maanya hoga
 It also said that India wants that the opportunity to implement the new constitution should be of happiness and satisfaction and not of protest and violence
 lekin hua vahi jisaki ashanka thi
 While there was a festive atmosphere in most of Nepal, curfew was imposed in parts of the Terai, the army had to impose
 bharat isse kaaphi chintit he
 According to Indian time, President Rambaran Yadav announced the implementation of the new constitution in a ceremony at around 5 pm
 uske kuch hi der baad, 6 bajkar 10 minute par halaat par lagaataar najar rakhe bhartiya videsh mantralay kaa bayaan aayaa ki hamane dekha he ki nayaa samvidhan lagu ho gaya he lekin desh ke kai hisson main hinsa se ham chintit hai
 We hope that dialogue in violence and pressure free environment will solve the problem and lay the foundation for peace and development
 tarai main logon ko ummid thi ki bharat in halaat main hastkshep karegaa lekin itnaa saaf he ki badale hue vakt main bharat sidhe taur par is maamle main shaayad naa pade
 The comments bharat kii jis tarah kii niti ab tak nepal main rahi he uski chhavi big brother vaali bani jisase wo kaaphi alokapriy ho chukaa he
 After the coming of the Modi government, efforts are being made to improve this image
 pradhanmantri banane ke baad narendra modi do-do baar nepal kaa daura kar chuke hai
 One reason is that Nepal has come very close to China
 china naa sirf nepal main nivesh kar rahaa he balki vahaan se sidhe kathmandu tak rail line bichaane kii prakriya bhi chal rahi he
 India does not want another border to become a headache for her
 isliye is puure maamle main wo phoonk phoonk kar kadam rakhega taaki nepal se behatar hote rishton par bhi aanch naa aae or madhesiyon kii samasya sulajhane kii taraf bhi nepal sarkaar kadam uthaae
 There was a constant fear of this
 madhesi bhi lagaataar is samvidhan kaa virodh karte rahe hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki is samvidhan main unke saath bhedbhaav hua he
 This is the reason why just two days before the Constitution came into force, India's Home Secretary S
 Jaishankar visited Nepal
 vahaan par unhone naa sirf alag-alag partiyon ke netaaon se mulaakaat kii balki pradhanmantri susheel koirala se bhi mulaakaat kii
 Jaishankar said that India is in favor of the new constitution and hopes that the leaders of Nepal will show such flexibility and maturity in this matter that the constitution will be carried by all and will be valid for all
 ye bhi kaha ki bharat chahta he ki nayaa samvidhan lagu hone kaa mauka khushi or santosh kaa ho naa ki virodh or hinsa kaa
 But that is what was expected
 jahaan adhiktar nepal main jashn kaa maahaul rahaa, tarai ke hisson main karfu lagu karnaa padaa, sena lagaani padi
 India is very concerned about this
 bhartiya samay ke mutabik shaam kareeb paanch baje ek samaaroh main raashtrapati rambaran yadav ne nae samvidhan ke lagu hone kaa elaan kiya
 Shortly thereafter, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs kept a close watch on the situation at 6
10 am, saying that we have seen that the new constitution has come into force but we are worried about violence in many parts of the country
 ummid karte hai ki hinsa or dabaav mukt maahaul main baatcheet se samasya suljhegi or shanti or vikaas kii neenv padegi
 People in the Terai hoped that India would intervene in these situations, but it is so clear that in the changed time, India may not directly fall into this matter
 tippaniyan The kind of policy of India which has been in Nepal till now has become an image of Big Brother, which has become quite unpopular
 modi sarkaar ke aane ke baad ab ye chhavi sudhaarney kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 After becoming the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has visited Nepal twice
 ek vajah ye bhi he ki nepal china ke kaaphi kareeb aa gaya he
 China is not only investing in Nepal, but the process of laying the rail line directly from there to Kathmandu is also going on
 bharat nahin chahta ki ek or sarhad uske liye sirdard ban jaae
 Therefore, in this whole matter, he will take steps to blow up so that better relations with Nepal are not affected and the Government of Nepal should also take steps towards solving the problem of Madhesis
 jaishankar ne kaha ki bharat nae samvidhan ke haq main he or ummid karata he ki nepal ke netaa is maamle main itnaa lacheelaapan or paripakvata dikhaaenge ki samvidhan sabko saath lekar chalane vaala or sabko maanya hoga

 Rohit Murder Case - Delhi Police presented Apoorva in Patiala House Court
 court main police ne kaha ki abhi yah jaanch kerani he ki apurva ke saath murder main koi or to nahin tha
 However, no other information has been revealed in the investigation so far
 saath hi apurva ko krime seen par lekar janaa he
 The court has sent Apoorva on two days police remand
 isse pehle police kishak kii sui teen logon rohit kii patni, uske driver or naukar par thi
 Police interrogated Apoorva for three days before arresting him
 bataa den, rohit shekhar kii maut kii vajah pehle heart atake yaa brain hemarej bataai gai thi
 But the post mortem report revealed that Shekhar's death was not due to these reasons but he was strangled to death
 iske baad police ne hatya kaa maamla darj kar jaanch shuru kar di
 If sources are to be believed, in a statement to the police, the wife claimed that she was intimate with Shekhar that night and may have been strangled
 rohit shekhar hatyakand main police ke saamne rohit shekhar kii patni ne jo daawa kiya wo chaunkaanewaala tha
 If sources are to be believed, Apoorva told that she went to Rohit's room on April 15-16
 wo rohit ke saath antarang thi
 It is possible that Rohit's throat and mouth have been buried due to which he has died

 kyonki rohit us vakt behad nashe main tha or agar aisa hua bhi to apurva use turant aspataal kyon nahin le gai
 Rohit's mother Ujjwala on Sunday accused her daughter-in-law Apoorva and her family of being greedy and said that they wanted to grab the family property
 unhone pehle kaha tha ki danpati ke bich shaadi ke pehle din se hi jhagade ho rahe the

 Gadkari said, 'I am not in the race for CM post' a day before Gadkari's meeting, bjp's state unit president Devendra Fadnavis, who is considered to be the most powerful contender for the post of Chief Minister in Maharashtra, met Bhagwat
 nagpur se saansad gadakari shahar ke mahal ilaake main sthit sangh bhawan apane dopahiyaa vaahan se gaye
 After the meeting, Gadkari said, 'I have met Sarsanghchalak ji
 yah har saal kii tarah diwali par hone vaali niyamit mulaakaat thi
 We have discussed the politics of Maharashtra and many other important issues except the post of Chief Minister
 ’bijepi ke varisht netaaon ke saath sangh pramukh kii mulaakaat us vakt ho rahi he jab pradhanmantri narendra modi dilli main endie ke saansadon ko chaay party dene ja rahe hai
 Recently, when Gadkari reached Nagpur from Delhi, Bhagwat was out of town at that time
 gadakari kaa yahaan bhavy swaagat kiya gaya tha
 After the results of the Maharashtra Assembly elections on October 19, the stir in the post of Chief Minister in the BJP intensified

 The head of the opposition party, Khaleda Zia, often says that during the current government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, her son is being prosecuted for political vendetta
 pakistan piples party (pipipi) ne 4 april ko apana chunaav abhiyaan gadhi khudabaksh gaanv main ek raily ke jariye shuru karne kaa faisla kiya tha
 The same day also marked the anniversary of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the founder of the party
 naudero jila mukhyalay par hone vaali is raily main 24 varshiya bilaval bhutto jaradaari ko rahanaa tha, par suraksha kaarnon se is badi raily ko choti sabha main tabdeel karnaa padaa
 Amidst all this, news came that Bilawal had left Pakistan after his alleged altercation with President Asif Ali Zardari
 haalanki haftebhar main hi ve vatan laut aae
 Believe the news, Bilawal had a debate with his father over his party's performance and Faryal Talpur's refusal to give tickets to candidates recommended for Bilawal in Sindh
 faryaal kaa parichay bas itnaa he ki ve jaradaari kii bahan hai
 However, in the PPP, she deals with all the daily affairs in the name of the President
 ek jaankaar bataate hai ki party ke nitigat maamalon main unka koi dakhal nahin hota, unki bhoomika sirf sandeshvahak kii rahati he
 These experts also believe that except Sindh, they have given full exemption to Anwar Saifullah in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Yusuf Raza Gilani in southern Punjab and Mian Manzoor Wattu in central Punjab
 kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki prashasnic maamalon main faryaal ke dakhal ko lekar party main gaharaa asantosh he
 It is no wonder that Zardari's three children, including Bilawal, 23-year-old daughter Bakhtawar and 20-year-old Asifa are close to their father
 yah aisa kunba he jisaki sabase badi chintaa khud ko bachaae rakhana he
 On one hand PPP does not have any popular leader who can lead the election campaign
 duusari ore is baat par gambhir asahmatiyaan hai ki bilaval ko unke rajnatik kariyar kii shuruyaat main itani jaldi siyasat ke morche par utaar kar kharch kar diya jaae
 Bilawal is young and equipped with ideas who consider himself the heir to Bhutto's legacy
 ab tak unka siyaasi imtihaan nahin hua he, lekin pipipi kaa agar koi bhi rajnatik bhavishya he to vah bilaval main hi hoga
 If anything happens to Bilawal, Zardari will not only lose his son but the political sun of the PPP will also sink
 bilaval ko lekar jaahir kii ja rahi suraksha sambandhi chintaaen jhooth nahin hai
 This time in the election of Pakistan, PPP is losing its head, so it would like to save Bilawal for the 2018 election
 pipipi kaa bhavishya bilavalsabhi ke dimag main ek hi sawaal he ki kya bilaval 11 may ko hone vaale aam chunaav ke prachaar abhiyaan kii lagaam thamenge
 The PPP will need 172 seats in the 342-member assembly to form the government
 pipipi ke kareebi sutron ke mutabik kaaphi charchaa ke baad janvari main yah faisla liya gaya ki bilaval ko saamne laakar unka kariyar nahin chaupat kiya jayega
 It was a well thought out and reasoned strategy
 chunaav ke baad pipipi agar sarkaar nahin bana saki, to yah bilaval ke liye acha mauka hoga ki ve party kii kaman apane haath main lekar vipaksh main baithen or agle chunaav tak raajnneeti ke gur seekhen
 Chaudhary Fawad Hussain of PPP, a former advisor to the Prime Minister, says, "PPP is going through generational change, so there will be a difference in the way the father and son work and approach
 bilaval abhi noujvaan hai lekin apni umr ke duusare logon kii banisbat unhone siyasat ko zyada kareeb se dekha he
 He grew up under the shadow of his mother Marhum Mohatrama Benazir Bhutto
 ve kai ahm kootnithik baithkon kaa bhi hissaa rahe hai, isliye siyasat se unka vaasta kuch duusare kism kaa he
 i think he is serious about the criticism in the media and his approach to politics is far more idealistic than the current PPP leadership
 ”chunaav kii khuli bajishayad 1970 ke baad se hue chunaavon ke mukaable is baar kaa chunaav kahin zyada saaf-suthra or nishpaksh rahegaa kyonki march main ai kaaryvahak sarkaar kaa charitra tatasth he
 The biggest achievement of PPP is that it has candidates all over the country
 jaradaari khud prachaar main nahin utar sakate kyonki ve raashtrapati hai or kisi rajnatik paksh main khadey hone se unhen court roktaa he
 Some people hope that the PPP has a pan-india reach and organization, so it is against Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim league-nawaz (PML-N), former cricketer Imran Khan's Pakistan tehreek-e-insaf (PTI) and other opponents The situation is good in mainstream parties
 kuch or jaankaar maanate hai ki apni pahunch or dhaanche ke hisaab se yah pradarshan nahin kar sakegi
 Says senior journalist Iftikhar Ahmed, "PPP is fighting a losing battle because its attitude is not sensitive both within and outside the party
 apane netritv ke daavon ke mutabik vah pradarshan nahin kar paaegi, lekin jis bhi party ko bahumat miltaa he jaradaari uske saath saudebaaji kii sthiti main honge, isliye ve khud ko bachaa le ja sakate hai
 “sindh has been the traditional stronghold of PPP and this time the situation will remain the same, despite that the administration there is decaying
 sattavirohi lahar se hone vaale chhitput nuksaan ko chhod den to pipipi sindh kii sabase badi party bani rahegi
 The real battle will be in Punjab
 party 1977 ke baad se hi madhya or uttari punjab main lagaataar apana aadhaar khoti ja rahi he, baavjood iske ki paanch saal ke uske shashan main chaar saal tak pradhanmantri rahane vaale yusuf raja gilaani khud dakshini punjab se hai
 The big question is whether the support that the PPP is getting in South Punjab will be sustained? The decision of the party to lose or win will be there
 kuch logon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki piemail (en) sarkaar ke dakshini punjab se barte gaye bhedbhaav ke baavjood pipipi ke mukaable uskaa pradarshan acha rahegaa kyonki navaj sharif ne vahaan ke logon ko achche rajkaaj kaa jo sapana dikhaaya he vah unke kaam aayega
 Even if the PPP lost the election and could get more than 70 seats, it would still be able to maintain its political base
 lekin 70 se kam siton par jeet kii sthiti main uske siyaasi vajood par sawaal khadaa ho jayega
 Journalist and political analyst Nusrat Javed says, "I don't think she (PPP) is going to form the next government
" ve khud bhi is baat ko jaanate honge
 "zigzag equations: Imran Khan is like a wild card throughout the game, who is a natural opponent of Sharif, not PPP
 madhya or uttari punjab samet khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa kaa hajaaraa divijan piemail (en) kaa paaramparik garh he, lekin is baar vahaan use imran kii taharike insaaf se chunauti mil rahi he jo teesri sabase badi party banakar ubhar sakati he
 All this will be decided only after the voters leave the houses
 patrkaar khalid ahamed kehete hai, ''imran khan kii ranneeti darasal kisi divine prerana se milane vaali jeet ke khyaal par tiki he
 Nawaz Sharif's strategy rests on the predictions of election analysts
 jaradaari kii ranneeti zyada vyaavhaarik or thos he kyonki yah haar kii ashanka par tiki he
 "the expectation of Zardari to remain in Parliament is currently coming out of the hatred between Imran and Sharif
" zyada se zyada yahi sambhaavna he ki imran piemail (en) ke saath gathbandhan nahin karenge
 PPP will be more open to tie up with anyone than the other two
 yadi aisa mumkin hota he, to jaradaari ek baar phir raashtrapati banane kii jugat laga sakate hai
 It should be remembered that while still in the office of the President, he will be able to avoid corruption cases and at least this desire is well known

 She contested at a time when her husband, brother and father were arrested by the government of Nawaz Sharif

 Former prime minister Benazir, killed in December 2007, gave all rights to his property in his will and to take care of his children till the age of 25, to Faryal and her husband Mir Munawar Talpur
 mir munwwar taqatvar jameendaar hai or mirpur khaas-umrkot-2 kii ene-227 seat se neshnal assembly ke sadsy bhi hai
 This time again he is going to fight from this seat

 Faryal suddenly came to light after the assassination of Benazir in 2007
 jaradaari ne unhen pipipi kii mahila ikai kaa adhyaksh bana diya
 She oversees the party's functioning from Rashtrapati Bhavan in Islamabad and Bilawal House in Karachi and is seen as a working person
 faryaal peshey se doctor hai lekin mana jaataa he ki unhone practice nahin kii he
 Like traditional Sindhi women, she is wearing a scarf on her head and is seen wearing bright red lipstick at parties or press conferences
 june, 2011 main hue aam chunaav main pakistan adhikrut kashmir main pipipi kii jeet ke peeche unki kaaphi mehnat thi
 In December 2011, he himself decided the PPP nominees for the Senate by examining them
 party sutron ke mutabik, seenet ke tikat die jane ke mudde par buaa or bhattije ke bich kaaphi garmagaram bahes hui thi
 Faryal then allegedly fired Benazir's trusted confidants Naheed Khan and Safdar Abbasi in 2012, sparking Bilawal's anger and complaining to his father
 is nok-jhonk main kiski jeet hui, yah bataane vaali baat nahin he
 Eventually Bilawal left the country
 pipipi ke ek bade netaa kehete hai, ''faryaal ke saamne bilaval kii chalane vaali nahin he
 ”—in Qatar Abbas, Islamabad shahid kapur ne apni eks-garlfriend karina kapur ko apni shaadi ke bare main khud bataaya he
 Recently, in an interview given to English newspaper 'DNA', when asked about the marriage of Kareena Seshaid, Kareena said that Kishidhid has told her about her marriage
 shahid kii shaadi ke bare main aage karina ne kaha, ' maine shahid ko shaadi ke liye badhai di
 This is a good decision
 meri shahid se mulaakaat kuch maheene pehle yashraj films productions main hui thi vahiin shahid ne mujhe bataaya ki vah shaadi karne ja rahe hai, jiske liye maine unhen badhai di
 a few months ago there were rumors about Hishahid and Kareenako that the two stars could be seen together in Vishal Bhardwaj's film Rangoon
 is film main saf ali khan ko bhi cast kiya gaya he
 But later this discussion proved to be wrong when news came that Kangana Ranot has been cast instead of Kareena apart from Shahid and Saif Ali Khan
 jab karina se yah poocha gaya ki kya vahashahidke saath aage kaam karnaa chahengi? to is sawaal ke jawaab main karina ne kaha, 'main har kisi ke saath or kisi ke liye bhi kaam karne ko taiyaar hum jo acha paisa degaa or jiske paas acchhee script hogi

 It is alleged that some 200 families of majority class have migrated after selling their house in Prahladnagar under Lisadi Gate police station area of meerut city

 It is alleged that most of these houses have been bought and sold within the last five-six years

 Due to such objectionable antics, the lives of the people there were terrible

 a few days ago, Councilor Jitendra Pahwa from Ward-56 of Bharatiya Janata Party had given an application to the police-administrative officers and sought to curb the mischievous elements
 lekin aarope he ki unke khilaaf koi prabhavi kadam nahin uthaaya gaya

 That is, the dispute is about putting a gate vahaan kuch log apane makaan bechakar ja rahe the, lekin unhone yahi bataaya ki ve apni marji se makaan bech rahe hai or un par koi dabaav nahin he
 At the same time, the police also say that this case is not from anywhere to anywhere

 Despite the Congress's soft stance on Nitish despite not supporting the UPA nominee in the presidential election, Rahul himself will soon talk to Nitish Kumar to improve relations with him
 raashtrapati chunaav main nitish ke badale rukh ko rahul gandhi chintaa kaa vishay nahin maanate
 It was on Rahul's initiative that Congress spokesperson Singhvi took a soft stance on Nitish
 rahul gandhi ko yah bharosa he ki nitish saath rahenge or bihar main gathbandhan sarkaar ko koi khatra nahin he
 According to the sources, Rahul also believes that Nitish's stance in the election of President and Vice President does not matter much and Nitish is doing so only to control Lalu
 lalu or unke parivaar par chal rahe maamalon se philhal gathbandhan par koi asar nahin hoga
 Significantly, Rahul Gandhi went abroad for holiday
 rahul ke videsh main rahete samay hi nitish ke badale rukh ke chalate nitish or congress main tanaav bad gaya tha
 Rahul has started to normalize the relationship as soon as he returns
 sutron ke mutabik rahul apane doot ke zarie nitish tak sandesh pahunchaa chuke hai
 While advocating for the opposition candidate in the presidential election, Nitish Kumar announced the support of the NDA candidate
 2019 main vipakshi ekta kii shuruaati taiyaari hi darak gai
 In Bihar, with the support of Lalu and Congress, there was a threat to the Grand Alliance government
 isi bich nitish ke rukh se naaraaz congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne nitish par tikhaa hamalaa kiya to duusari taraf se nitish ke pravaktaa kasee tyaagi ne javaabi hamalaa bol diya
 Nitish himself went a step ahead and said that he is not a hanger of the Congress
 iske baad to sawaal uthaa ki kya mahagathbandhan ke din puure ho gaye?raashtrapati chunaav menvipaksh kii ummidavaar mira kumaar ke naam ke elaan or unke namakan ke vakt rahul gandhi videsh main the
 Rahul is considered the main reason for the Congress alliance with Nitish
 rahul ke kareebi maanate hai ki 2019 main agar vipaksh ke kisi or netaa ko piem banane kii baat ai to rahul kii pehali pasand nitish ho sakate hai
 From this, one can understand the mutual understanding between Rahul and Nitish
 isiilie videsh se rahul laute to congress ne aadhikarik rup se apane tevar naram kar liye
 In fact, according to sources, Rahul is confident that even though Nitish has supported Kovind as the Governor of Bihar in the presidential election, he will not go to the NDA
 saath hi nitish ye kadam lalu par check rakhane ke liye bhi uthaaya he
 It should not make much sense
 a post shared by Riteish Deshmukh (@riteishd) on Dec 18, 2017 at 10:10pm PST On the indore-patna Express rail accident, former Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi said that we are all responsible for this incident, there should be a national policy for railways in the country but it is not

 Talking about wearing dhoti suits not money, Dinesh Trivedi said on Bullet train that you do not have clothes to wear dhoti but you are talking about wearing suits
 desh main railway kaa basic foundation charmara gaya he, railway par report to bahut banati he lekin koi bhi saansad yaa netaa unhen padhata nahin he, agar train main LHB coach hote to shaayad yah haadasa nahin hota
 The rail tracks should be inspected from time to time, but this is not happening
 is samay railway kaa paas paisa nahin he, railway diwalia he or ye log vaai-faai or hai-faai kii baat kar rahe he

 The problem starts when people in the matter of marital relationship also refrain from keeping their spirit

 There is an old saying that if even Lord Vishnu does not remain clean and inactive, then Lakshmi will not delay in abandoning her
 bhale hi yah atishyokti ho, par yah baat aam logon main sahi soch viksit karne ke iraade se kahi gai he
 It means to say that only lovers and girlfriends decorate each other, so it is utterly unfair

 kohli ne kaha ki vah aisi team bananaa chaahate hai jo kam se kam agle paanch saal tak world cricket ke top par bani rahe
 Kohli's Test captainship was given by Mahendra Singh Dhoni after his retirement
 isi saal janvari main australia ke khilaaf chaar maichon kii test siries ke dauraan tisare test ke turant badadhoni ne test se sanyasale liya
 After this, Kohli was handed the reins of Team India
 kohli ne kaha ki vah team main dostana maahaul bananaa chaahate hai
 Kohli espncricinfo
 com ko die ek intervyuu main kaha, ‘main chahta hum ki bhartiya team kam se kam paanch yaa chah saal tak dabadabaa banaae rakhe
 He said, 'we do not lack talent and capability
 sawaal bas ye he ki aap unase talmail kaisaa banaate hai
 He said, 'I want to create a strong friendly atmosphere among the team members
 ham saal main 250-280 din saath rahete hai, lihaaja main aisa maahaul bananaa chahta hum ki agle das saal tak baahar se dekhne par lage ki yah team puri tarah se ekajute he
 It wants to play for each other
 khilaadi sirf apane liye nahin khelte
 that's my line
 ’kohli aakraamak cricket main vishwaas karte hai or har haal main jeetne kii koshish karnaa chaahate hai chaahe ant main drow karne ke liye bhi sangharsh kyon na karnaa pade
 He wants to play a kind of cricket
 bangladesh ke daure par wo bataur test captain ja rahe hai
 He said, 'I want to keep him free from any kind of insecurity or doubt
 agar aap field main australia ko khelte dekhen to aap nishchit taur par chahenge ki aisi hi team hamaari bhi ho
 They play as a unit
 unhen haraane ke liye hamen apana sarvshereshth dena hoga
 And i want to see this happening in Indian cricket
 hamen haraane ke liye timen tarasein, ye main chahta hum
 It is just a matter of mindset
 kabhi-kabhi ham us jone main pahunch jate hai jahaan hamaari soch sahi nahin kar rahi hoti
 "kohli remembers the day he addressed the team as captain, just before the first Test on the tour of Australia," the meeting took place in the manager's room at the hotel
 maine ladakon se kaha ki agar aapmen se koi is mindset ke saath australia ja rahaa he ki mujhe vahaan do shatak lagane hai yaa do-teen baar pari main paanch wicket lene hai to yah apane dimag se nikaal de
 If you are better, you have the ability, then you will fight there win or lose
 drow karnaa mujhe antim vikalp dikhataa he
 i am not afraid to take the risk to win, even if i lose
 main chahta hum ki aap aakraamak cricket khelen
 Kohli hit a century in both innings of the first Adelaide Test of the Australian tour
 pehla test jeetne kii koshish main team haar gai or daure ke antim test se thik pehle dhoni ke ritairement kii vajah se chauthe test ke liye kohli ko captain niyukt kar diya gaya
 Kohli said, 'I could not think that i have been made captain in the Test
 ’ us din kii is ghatana ko yaad karte hue kohli ne kaha, ‘maahaul kuch shant hone par main apane kamare main gaya
 Anushka, who had come there to watch the series, was there and i told her about it
 wo bhi isse achambhit thi ki yah sab itnaa achaanak kaise ho gaya
 Why did he (dhoni) do this? Thinking that i am going to be the permanent captain of Team India, we both kept silent for a while and then i cried because i never thought of that
 eemaandaaree se, jab maine khelnaa shuru kiya to kabhi sochaa nahin tha ki team india kii captaini karuunga
 My dream was just to play cricket for the country
 ab sab kuch sochataa hum ki kaise bachapan main cricket, club cricket, skool cricket, state cricket sabhi yaaden ek saath aa rahi hai
 It was unrealistic

 unhone kaha ki kaaryakarta yahaan bhi tent lagane vaale the lekin unhen roak ke rakhaa gaya tha
 Let me tell you that in 2004, when Sonia Gandhi refused to become Prime Minister, a large number of Congress workers came to celebrate her

 The Sheena Bora murder case is a high profile murder case
 lihaaja police jaanch main kisi bhi tarah kii chook nahin karnaa chaahati
 After the arrest of Indrani, the biggest question is why did she do Sheena Kaqtal? To answer this question, it is necessary to see the fabric of Peter Mukherjee and Indrani's family

 ye donon hi guwahati main rahaa karte the
 Sheena later moved to Delhi
 or indrani ne use apane soshal cirkil main apni bahan ke taur par logon se milwaaya
 After marrying Peter Mukherjee, Indrani introduced Rahul and Sheena to people by calling Sheena her sister
 yahaan tak peter bhi is baat se anjaan the
 During this time, the relationship between Rahul Mukherjee and Sheena began to grow closer
 or wo donon kaaphi kareeb aa gaye
 But Indrani, who is growing close to Sheena with her step-son Rahul Mukherjee, was not pleased
 darasal agar rishte ke lihaaj se dekha jaae to rahul peter mukherjee kaa betaa tha
 And daughter of Sheena Indrani
 jab peter or indrani ne shaadi kar lee to rahul or shina rishte main ek duusare ke bhai-bahan ho gaye the
 Indrani did not like this relationship of both

 In April this year, a 13-year-old boy was killed in an attack of a bull shark while surfing on the water, since then there has been a demand for more security

 Four years ago 39 Indian nationals kidnapped from Mosul in Iraq have been killed
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj ne khud sansad ko isaki jaankaree di
 In 2014, the militants who went to work in Mosul from India were abducted by the terrorists
 jab unhone bhaagane kii koshish kii to iesas ke aatankiyon ne unhen gherkar maar diya
 However, Harjit Christ, who returned to India after saving his life from the hostages, had already claimed that all the remaining 39 Indians had been killed
 lekin sarkaar ne unke is daawey ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 In July last year, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj made it clear that until evidence is found, she cannot consider the abducted Indians dead
 ab bharat kii videsh mantri chaahati hai ki chaar saal main 39 shavon kii shinaakht ko bharat sarkaar kii kamyaabi mana jaae
 But the Congress has attacked the government
 congress ne sarkaar kii deree par sawaal uthaate hue isaki vajah poochi he
 In fact, 39 workers in India worked in the Iraq city of Mosul
 june 2014 main bagdadi ke logon ne jab mosul par dhaava bolaa to wo nikal nahin sake or iesas ke changul main funs gaye
 While Harjit managed to escape by saving his life
 bagdadi ke aatankiyon ne bandhakon ko chaar saal pehle hi maar daalaa tha
 But the complicit government kept the breath till the Punjab elections, because 31 out of 39 were from Punjab
 i told the truth that 39 Indians were killed
 The government has misled the 39 families who lost their relatives: Harjit Masih, man who returned from Mosul earlier, claimed that 39 Indians were killed by ISIS there

 General VK Singh toured Iraq in search of this, but how serious he was about this discovery and how much attention was given to it by the Iraqi government, it can be understood from the fact that when he reached Baghdad on 24 October 2017, neither The Prime Minister of Iraq was present in the country, neither the Foreign Minister nor the Defense Minister

 andervald ke sabase bade don daaud ibrahim ke bhai ikbaal kaskar par kisne hamalaa kiya? koun he jo mumbai ko garma rahaa he? koun he jo ek baar phir mumbai kii sadakon par khooni gangvaar dekhnaa chahta he? nishaanaa bhale hi sirf ek ho lekin daanv par puraa mumbai he
 What is the reality behind this attack? Why was the principle of gang war broken? And who wants to make Mumbai hot? Obviously you would want to know who would have dared to enter Dawood's house and attack Dawood's brother i
e
 Dawood himself? Who is he who wants to give two straight hands to Dawood? So first look at the list of enemies of d Company and the story of Mumbai Police
 dakshini mumbai ke nagpada ilaake main mangalvaar kii raat saadhe nau baje raat kii namaaz khatm ho chuki thi
 Dawood Ibrahim's brother Iqbal Kaskar returned home after offering prayers
 uske saath bodyguard arrif samet chah-saat gurgey the
 Meanwhile, four boys entered the same area of nagpada, which is called the stronghold of d Company
 inamen do motor cycle par savaar the or do paidal
 As the boys on the motorcycle gestured to the two boys on foot, one of them immediately took out a revolver from the pocket and emptied all the bullets towards Iqbal Kaskar and his henchmen
 chunki aarif sabase aage khadaa tha lihaaja sari goliyaan usee ko bhed gayi
 Meanwhile, the other henchmen, including Iqbal, had hidden under the cover of the house
 kaam khatm hote hi donon ladke ab duusare revolver se hawa main goliyaan chalate hue baahar kii taraf bhaage
 But the area was tight and the crowd was quite large
 lihaaja kuch dur jane ke baad bheed ne donon ko pakad liya or phir unhen police ke hawaale kar diya
 While taking advantage of the chaos, both boys had already slipped in the motorcycle cycle
 hamale main ikbaal kaa bodyguard aarif maukey par hi maaraa gaya
 The names of all the enemies of d-company started appearing one by one
 pehla shaq bainkak main baithe don satosh shetty par gaya
 Who had an old rivalry with the company but let India Mot Wanted guess the horror of Dawood that as soon as Shetty's name was linked to this attack, he started wandering the news channels of the phone and self-cleaning that Shetty gang was not in this attack
 
 udhar hamale ke fouran baad mumbai krim branch kii immergency meeting shuru ho chuki thi
 The police started a furore over Chhota Rajan and some of the gangs running behind him in the incident, including Ravi Pujari, Hemant Pujari, Ejaz Lakdawala and even Bablu Srivastava and Ali Bundesh
 police ko andeshaa tha ki kuch hi der main di company ke dushmano kii isi fehrist main se koi koi don is ghatana kii jimmedaari legaa or phir gangvaar chhidate der nahin lagegi
 But every don in the same underworld who wanted to escape from this incident on Tuesday, who used to take responsibility for such incidents in order to increase their stature
 har don safai de rahaa tha, hamalaa usne nahin kiya
 He does not have a hand behind the attack
 aakhir maamla bhai ke bhai kaa tha
 All the don of the underworld who keep threatening the d-company every time, have either become silent or given their clarification immediately after this attack
 bas isi se andaja laga lijie ki is hamale kaa matlab or uskaa anjaam kya he yaa kya hone vaala he?hamalaa daaud ke garh main ghus kar kiya gaya
 David's brother was carried out outside David's house
 magar mumbai police kahati he ki hamalaa daaud ke bhai par nahin balki bhai ke bodyguard par kiya gaya tha
 This is obviously not the case of the police
 isaki vajah bhi he
 If Aif was the target, the attackers could go to Arif's house or kill him anytime, anywhere
 wo daaud ke garh main ghus kar itnaa bada khatra mol nahin lete par police kii majaburi he
 She does not want the matter caught up because then it would be impossible to stop the gangs on the streets of Mumbai
 anderworld ke sutron ke mutabik khud chota rajan ne is hamale main haath hone se inkaar kar diya he or kehete hai ki di company or mumbai police bhi ye maan chuki he ki is hamale se chota rajan kaa koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 Then who attacked? Aaj Tak also scolded d Company and its enemies as well as some top officers of Mumbai Police for reaching the truth
 iske baad jo baaten saamne ain wo behad chaunkaane vaali hai
 According to sources in Mumbai Police, the gang may be involved in the attack, who wants to beat d Company and Chhota Rajan and become the biggest don himself
 is gang kaa nepal main acha-khaasaa dabadabaa he
 Indralal Bahadur Khatri, one of the two captured Hamalars, hails from Nepal and was previously associated with the Maoists
 saiyad bilal bhi idha kaaphi vakt se nepal main rah rahaa tha
 Apart from this, Mumbai Police is also not denying that the motive behind this attack can be to get Dawood out of his stronghold and threaten him
 osama kii maut ke baad daaud naa sirf dar gaya he balki khabar he ki usne pakistan main apana thikaana bhi badal liya he
 Well, there is another theory about this attack and that is that the police themselves want to end this gang war and the underworld forever by fighting different sections of the underworld
 idhar mumbai main ikbaal kaskar par hamalaa hota he or udhi pandrah minute baad hi pakistan main chupe daaud ko isaki khabar mil jaati he, phone par
 The entire d-company suddenly becomes upset
 wo hamale ke bare main choti se choti jaankaree hasil karnaa chahta he par khud daaud, anis or chota shakeel mumbai phone nahin kar sakate the kyonki iesai nahin chaahati thi
 Bullets were fired at Nagpada in Mumbai and the phone rang in Pakistan
 bhai ko bhai par hue hamale kii jaankaree mil chuki thi
 Every big man of d Company sitting in Pakistan, especially Dawood's family, was taking the smallest details of the attack on phone
 daaud or uske bhaaiyon ne tab chaiyn kii saans lee jab pataa chalaa ki ikbaal kaskar sahi-salaamat he
 But this attack also showed the helplessness of Dawood and his brothers
 bebasii phone naa karne kii
 According to Intelligence Bureau sources, after the death of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, Pakistani intelligence agency IAI has imposed many restrictions on Dawood Ibrahim, Anees Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel
 taaki pakistan main uski maujuudagi sabit naa ho sake or inhen main se ek bandish he in teenon ke bharat phone karne par roak
 According to sources, the ISI has instructed Dawood, Anees and Chhota Shakeel to inform anyone in India a day before they receive a call
 baqayada un phone numberon kii list de jinpar unhen phone karnaa he
 Only after the isi's green signal can they get the phone again
 itnaa hi nahin iesai ne raat ko sone se pehle in teenon ke kamaron se tamaam phone, fax aure internet ke kanacshan bhi kaat dene kaa hukum de rakhaa he
 According to the sources, Dawood and Anees first informed the ISI about the news of the attack on Bhai on Tuesday night and then after receiving approval, got a call in Mumbai late at night
 varna tab tak wo bas bebas mumbai se aane vaale phone kaa hi intjaar karata rahaa or usee bich ajtak bhi phone ke jariye di company tak pahunchaa
 Dawood's brother Anees Ibrahim told Aaj Tak that the company will answer the attack on his brother
 di-company kii buniyaad saikadon laashon par khadi kii gai
 Hundreds of people were killed in the underworld in awe of d Company
 daaud ne laashon ke dher par chalakar apane khauf kaa nizaam kaayam kiya
 The decade of the eighties is witness of Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar's trembling Mumbai
 mumbai kii arthor road jail main buniyaad rakhi gayi us di company kii jisaki keemat aaj 3000 karod bataayi jaati he
 Some people even say its worth is 90 thousand crores
 sampatti ke is pahaad par laashon ke dher se hokar pahunchaa he daaud
 Dawood Ibrahim, son of a police constable smuggling for Haji Mastan, was a criminal from Fitrat
 paisa uski majaburi or kamajori thi
 Dawood Ibrahim looted a boat in Darya for the first time in 1977 while working for Haji Mastan, according to the events that emerged from the Mumbai Police file
 aaj ke daam par uski keemat thi 1 karod 26 lakh rupe
 In the heat of money, Dawood Ibrahim stepped forward, leaving behind his mentor Haji Mastan, then stood in front of him
 Mumbai's Pathan Gangdoud Ibrahim was the first to make d Company the king of Mumbai, in front of his close Lala's company
 Determined to uproot kareem lala ke bhattije alamjeb or alam gir ise chalaate the
 Despite the agreement, Dawood annihilated both of them
 kareem lala ke pathan giroh ke bache khuche logon ne alamjeb or alamgir kii hatya kaa badla lene ke liye daaud ibrahim ke bhai shabbir kii chalati sadak par hatya kar di or iske baad daaud ibrahim ne hatyaon kii jhadi laga di
 Dawood Ibrahim slaughtered Karimala and the people associated with him in 18 months in 18 months to avenge the murder of brother Shabbir in 1981
 iske baad daaud ibrahim ne india today ko die gaye apane intervyuu main kaha ki ham to maamuli vyapaaree the, hamaare bhai kii hatya ne hi hamen apradhi bana diya
 But these murders made Dawood dominant in Mumbai and now the coin of Dawood and his company started running
 daaud ke dushmano ne abaki daanv lagaaya daaud ke bahanoi par
 Ibrahim Parkar, husband of sister Hasina Parkar, was shot dead by the Gawli gang
 daaud gusse se pagal ho gaya
 In 1992, Dawood murdered Gawli's man Shailesh Haldankar, admitted to JJ Hospital, amid police custody
 iske baad mumbai ke saare gangon ke bich ek alikhit samjhauta ho gaya ki koi kisi ke parivaar par waar nahin karegaa
 In such a situation, when the brother of Dawood was attacked, the senses of the Mumbai Police are blown away
 mumbai main unniis sau tiranbe ke dhamaakon ke baad anderworld sampradayik aadhaar par bant gaya isamen jahaan ek taraf daaud ibrahim kii di company, iesai, iem, lashkar-e-taiyaba or alqaida khadey the vahiin duusari ore chota rajan, bharat nepali,bablu shrivastav, ejaj lakdawala, viki malhotra,santosh shetty, ali bangash,banty pandey, ravi pujari vagaira khadey the
 Now Dawood has become the most dreaded terrorist of the world
 uskaa network bharat ke khilaaf aatanki vaardaaton main istemaal kiya jaataa he par mumbai main uske naam kaa khauf ab bhi kaayam hai uske dushmano me chota rajan hi sabase majboot he or wo daaud virdohi sarkari khufia agenciyon se madad kii jugad main laga rahata he
 But this latest incident by entering Dawood's house has definitely given the clue that the efforts to beat Dawood are probably getting stronger again
 meerut main rishton kii maryaada ko taar-taar kar dene vaali ek ghatana saamne ai he
 The two brothers, with their actions, soothed the sacred relationship of brother and sister
 aarope he ki donon bhai apni 15 saal kii sagi bahan se pichley kai saalon se dushkarm karte rahe
 The victimized girl in Meerut has surprised everyone by making sensational allegations of molesting her two brothers
 12veen kaksha main padhane vaali bahan kaa aarope he ki pichley chaar saalon se uske donon bhai uske sathbalaatkaarakarte aa rahe hai or baat ko saarvajanik karne par dhamkee dete hai
 The victim cunningly imprisoned the accused brothers in the handcuffs of the mobile and reached out to an NGO for help where they were taken to police
 iske baad police ne aaropee bhaaiyon ko giraft main le liya he
 The girl living in the civil lines of Meerut was shocked when she told her on-going NGO and the police
 ladki ne bataaya ki uske donon sage bhai hi 4 saalon uski asmat lutate aa rahe hai
 At present, on the complaint of the girl, the police have apprehended the accused brothers and after conducting medical examination of the girl got involved in the investigation of the case
 police kaa kahana he ki donon bhaiyon ne poochtacha main apana gunaah kabool kar liya he
 SP City of Meerut, Ranvijay Singh said that an FIR has been registered in the case
 sabooton ke aadhaar par donon bhaaiyon kogiraftarkar liya gaya he
 They said that during interrogation both of them had confessed their crime
 donon aaropee bhaaiyon ko castady main lekar aage karrwai kii jaaegi
 On Wednesday, India's mig-21 aircraft hit Pakistan's F-16 along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, which is being appreciated across the country
 lekin visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki aieef kaa vimaan bhale hi purana tha, lekin iskaa nayaa sanskaran bison nihsandeh purana nahin he
 There was a fight between the Pakistan Air Force and the Indian Air Force fighter planes, in which it emerged that Wing Commander Abhinandan managed to take down the intruder aircraft from his mig-21
 haalanki, pakistan ne hamale main epa-16 vimaan ke shaamil hone se inkaar kar diya, lekin bharat ne iske sakshya hone kii baat kahi
 The mig-21 and F-16 belong to different generations
 pieef ne america nirmit ladaaku vimaan epa-16si / di ke naye sanskaran ko udaaya tha, jabaki mig-21 bison, 60 saal se seva de rahe ek vimaan kaa unnat avatar he
 The public perception of the mig-21 in India is not encouraging, as it has got the name of 'flying coffin' due to frequent crashes of aircraft, which recently raised questions about the old fighter aircraft in a tense atmosphere with Pakistan
 Are going visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki epa-16 lakshya saadhane ke lihaaj se bahut hi behatar he, lekin mig-21 kii apni khaasiyat he
 Experts say that the mig-21 is clearly the Indian Air Force's choice, because of its readiness to patrol and be used at all times in any emergency
 visheshgyon ke anusaar, is bhoomika ke liye mig-21 sabase tarjihi vimaan he, kyonki ve anya duusare sabhi ladaaku vimaanon kii tulana main hawaii yatra karne ke liye sabase kam samay lete hai

 i told him many times that we would have to do something to get out of all this

 'tippaniyan On September 20, 2002, Interpol arrested both of them from Lisbon before Monica and Abu could leave Portugal
 donon ko farji dastavezon ke aadhaar par portugal main ghusane ke aarope main jail bhi janaa padaa
 In 2006, an Indian court found Monica Bedi guilty of forging a passport in a fake name
 saal 2010 main supreme court ne monica kii sazaa to barkaraar rakhi lekin uski avadhi thodi kam kar di kyonki wo pehle hi sazaa kaat chuki thi
 Monica has said that she has not been in contact with Abu Salem since her arrest

 We were with each other for a short time, not for long as people think
 main aaj bhi hamaare rishte kii izzat karti hum lekin main ab aage bad chuki hum
 i have never denied our relationship
 vah pyaar hi tha or usase zyada kuch nahin

 saal 2006 main ek bhartiya court ne monica bedi ko jaali naam se passport banane kaa doshi paaya tha
 In 2010, the Supreme Court upheld Monica's sentence but shortened her term because she had already been sentenced
 monica kah chuki hai ki giraftaar ke baad se vah abu salem se sampark main nahin hai
 He had said in an interview to Hindustan Times, 'we are not in touch
 ham donon bahut kam samay ke liye ek-duusare ke saath the, na ki lambey samay tak jaisaa ki logon ko lagata he
 i still respect our relationship but i have now moved forward

 Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday questioned the Centre's MP Adarsh gram Vikas Yojana, saying that changing one village cannot lead to the development of villages across the country and the scheme should not be imposed from above
 rahul ne yojana ke liye dhan kaa spasht praavdhaan nahin kiye jane kaa aarope bhi lagaaya or kaha ki kendra ne ab tak yah nahin bataaya he ki is yojana ke liye dhan kahaan se or kitni maatra main aayega
 On the first day of his two-day visit to his parliamentary constituency, Amethi, Rahul said in a public meeting held in Jagadishpur village, adopted for the MP Adarsh gram Vikas Yojana, "I chose the village under the plan, but i really have a different perspective
" 
 meri soch har gaanv ko shakti dene kii he, ek gaanv ko nahin
 All six lakh villages of India are not going to change with one village becoming a model
 mere sansadeey kshetra main 700 gaanv hai
 '' unhone kaha ‘‘meri soch he ki agar ek-ek gaanv ko badalanaa he to hamen gaanv kii janata ko shakti deni hogi
 The drawback is that you do not have power in your hand
 upar se desh chalaaya ja rahaa he
 We brought MNREGA, RTI
 
 
 hindustan ke har vyakti ke liye adhikaar laaye
 My thinking is to give power and authority to every person
 ’’ The Congress vice-president asked the Center, "I do not understand very well that you have made a plan, but what are the funds for it?" 
 Tell me also how much money you are sending for this scheme
 agar vikaas karnaa he to kuch naa kuch fund kii bhi jarurat hoti he
 '' congress upaadhyaksh ne kaha, ‘‘jis prakaar se aap gaanv saaf karte hai, vah aapaki jimmedaari he
 You have a village, you have a home
 
 This is your country
 ham yah bhi chaahate hai ki gaanv saaf rahe
 i think it should not be imposed on you from above
 ’’ Rahul said, "the village has its own way, there is brotherhood, it has been running since long
