 Former India mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton believes that if a team plays continuously, then its players start suffering 'mental fatigue' and the same is happening with Indian cricket players
 aptan ne kaha, ‘maujuuda kaarykram khilaadiyon se mashin kii tarah kaam karwaata he
 We can gauge the physical impact on the players but it is difficult to predict the mental fatigue that the players have to experience while on the field for each pressure match
 ’england ke maujuuda daure ke baad bharat ko isi team ke khilaaf gharelu sarajameen par ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa khelni he
 After this, the entire series will be held in the home country against the West Indies after which the team has to go on a difficult tour of Australia
 mahendra singh dhoni, sachin tendulkar, jahir khan, suresh raina, viraat kohli jaise khilaadiyon ko is bich champions lig twanti20 toornament main bhi khelnaa he
 Upton did not hesitate to say that the World Cup also had an impact on the players
 unhone kaha, ‘vishwa cap vyast prakiya he, is toornament kii taiyaari or saat hafte tak ise khelnaa donon
 It is a long tournament
 khilaadiyon par shaareerik boj padataa he, mujhe nahin lagata ki khilaadiyon ko ahsaas he ki un par kitna bhaar he
 'upton said,' i spoke to Yuvraj Singh who said that he had been ill for almost two weeks after the World Cup
 mujhe pataa he ki kai aise khilaadi the jo vishwa cap ke baad maansik taur par thake hue the
 The injuries to the Indian players started appearing in the World Cup and soon thereafter
 aptan ne kaha ki atyaadhik cricket ke kaaran achaanak kii bharat ke hai profile cricketer ausat khilaadi lagane lage
 He also revealed that he, along with former coach Gary Kirsten, once spoke to the Board of Cricket in India (BCCI) on the fatigue of players and suggested to keep them at the best level
 aptan ne kaha, ‘bhartiya board ne bharat main test maichon ke dauraan khilaadiyon ko ghar jane kii sweekruti dene, ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa ke dauraan khilaadiyon ko match main nahin khilne kii sweekruti dene jaise suzav sweekaar kiye the jisase ki yojana banaakar khilaadiyon ko aaraam diya ja sake
 However, it is difficult for players like captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take a break because of his responsibility as captain and the sponsors also want him to play in all the series, whether it is important or not
 aptan ne kaha, ‘praayojakon or rajasav laane waalon ke liye yah adarsh sthiti he ki atyadhik cricket khelaa jaae lekin yah khel kii gunvattta ke liye adarsh nahin he
 Many other things seem to be dominating the program

 It seems that the state government, which is facing a shortage of funds, is not in a position to provide class IV employees in schools

 It can be seen in the video that 2 children of class 4 are sitting on a tree branch and then coming down
 do anya bacchon ko kudaal ke saath classroom main jate dekha ja saktaa he
 How much the teachers are afraid of the children, it can be found from this that they refused to name the class teacher and also said that they had climbed the tree on their own free will

 garbh dhaaran na karne ke liye saalon se garbhanirodhak goliyon kaa istemaal hota aa rahaa he
 Despite this, most women are not convinced about its consumption
 garbhanirodhak goliyon ko lekar kai aisi baaten hai jinka isse dur-dur tak koi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The first confusion for women is whether they can take contraception without doctor's advice
 vaise to kuch bhi karne se pehle doctor kii salaah lenaa best he, khaastaur par un mahilaon ko jinaki medical history he
 But if you are completely healthy, then any recognized high quality contraceptive pill can be taken
 garbhanirodhak goliyon ko lekar duusarasbase bada myth ye he ki inke seven se vajan badhata he
 Actually, most tablets contain a mixture of estrogen and progestoran
 estrogen kii maatra se pani kaa jamaav hota he or sharir heavi ho jaataa he, jisase vajan bad jaataa he
 But while making today's contraceptive pills, special care is taken so that the weight does not increase
 par pet se judi samasyaon se peedit mahila ko doctor se salaah le leni chahie
 The third big myth is that the use of birth control pills affects fertility
 haalanki ye puri tarah galat nahin he kyonki goliyansharir ke hormones par asar daalati hai
 In such a situation, if you want to get pregnant, stop taking the pills two to three months before getting pregnant
 iske saath hi ye bhi kaha jaataa he ki iske seven se periods par prabhaav padataa he lekin aisa hone ke chasenj kam hi hote hai
 Although it can be affected to some extent due to hormonal change, but it has little effect
 agar aapako pehle se hi masik chakra se judi koi samasya he to doctor ke paraamarsh ke baad hi goliyon ko haath lagaaein

 It was good to air this rumor for the success of the film
 lekin is 'syrius' relationships kii 'syrius' charchaa kii 'syriasnes' kii hawa nikaal thi khud arjuna kapur ne ek bada khulaasa kar ke
 Arjun has told the whole world the name of the girl for whom he was really serious at one time
 oh! ab ye to kuch juyada hi syrius ho gaya
 Talking about his 'first' and 'only' affair, Arjun Kapoor shared that he was dating someone when he was 18 years old
 unka ye 'papi lav' do saalon tak unke saath rahaa
 Then they broke up
 us vakt film produsar boni kapur ke bete arjuna kapur film 'salaam-e-ishk' main bataur assistant diarector filmon ke gur sikh rahe the
 During that time, Arjun Kapoor did not even look like the hot hunk he now appears
 us vakt ek film diarector kaa sapana paal rahe arjuna kapur kaa vajan 114 kilogram tha
 Well, the news is not how Arjun Kapoor was a boyfriend
 khabar ye bhi nahin ki wo actor kii bajaay film diarector bananaa chaahate the
 Rather, the news is that who the girl was
 chaliye ham aapako bataa hi dete hai
 Actually that girl was Dabangg Khan Salman Khan's younger sister Arpita
 apni pehali lav story ke bare main bolte hue arjuna kapur ne ye bhi bataaya he ki wo ye chaahate the ki is bare main salmaan ko kisi or ki bajaae khud vah bataaen
 When he reached Arpita's house, he was quite scared
 lekin unki aashcharya kaa thikaana nahin rahaa jab unhone ye discover kiya ki salmaan khan or unke parivaar ko arjuna or arpita ke rishte se koi parhez nahin he
 However, Arjun breaks up with Arpita
 phir bhi salmaan khan ne unase koi naaraazgi nahin paali
 Rather, Salman Khan was the hand behind bringing Arjun's career on track
 aisa khud arjuna kapur ne bataaya he

 a notification to make the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) and the Constitution Amendment Act (99th Amendment Act) effective from today was issued by the Department of Justice in the Ministry of Law
 iske saath hi nayi ikai ko sanvaidhanik darja praapt ho gaya he
 The special thing is that after 48 hours of issue, this case will once again go to the Supreme Court, where the demand for cancellation of this notification is being sought

 The bench will start hearing the case on 15 April
 7 april ko supreme court kii dabl bench ne maamle ko samvidhan peeth bhejte hue kaha tha ki kanoon par roak lagane kii baat samvidhan peeth ke saamne rakhe
 a number of lawyers' bodies filed petitions in the Supreme Court and challenged it

 The petition said that this would increase the interference of the executive in the appointment of judges, which would affect the independence and impartiality of the judiciary
 sunwaayee ke dauraan centre sarkaar ne court main ise sahi tehraate hue kaha tha ki supreme court is maamle main abhi sunwaayee kar saktaa kyonki iske liye notification jari nahin hua he
 The petition said that the Judicial Appointments Commission Act and the 121st Constitutional Amendment Act should be repealed, as it increases executive interference in the appointment of judges in the Supreme Court and the High Court, which not only impedes the independence of the judiciary but also the core of the constitution
 It also affects the framework in which there is talk of an independent judiciary

 kanoon kii dhara 5(6) kahati he ki agar ayog ke do sadsy kisi kii niyukti ke liye sahamat nahin to ayog us vyakti kii niyukti kii sifarish nahin karegaa
 The petitioner says that this simply means that the view of the Chief Justice can be ignored, while the Constitution Bench of the nine-judge Supreme Court Advocate on Record case has said that the Chief Justice's opinion in the appointment of judges should not be ignored
 Whereas, according to the new law, a small group of commission (two members) can do so
 naye kanoon main do vikhyath vyaktiyon kii yogyata kya hogi yah tay nahin or na hi yah tay he ki ve kis kshetra se chune jaaenge jabaki in do sadasyon ke paas baaki ke chaar sadasyon kii raay palatney kaa adhikaar hoga

 i am concerned for my son's safety
 @anushkasharma @virat
 kohli The last thing we would want is to get publicity out of your cheap STUNT in the name of CLEANLINESS! You both posted a video for your fans n followers by VIOLATING Basic Rights to privacy & you shamed my son in the video as well in your post content you both may be who you are in your fields, with millions of followers & all the PR backing you 
 
 
 you may be payed for your campaigning or maybe doing it for sheer publicity As a mother,i would like to state that you have not only shamed my son @arhhansingh on social media by not blurring his face, but youve also exposed him to unwanted hostility
 
 
 
 and danger from fanatics for such a small thing that you claim he has done but have no proof of anyways ? i am concerned about my sons SAFTEY !!! how dare you crush somebody’s image / and morale and reputation and expose him to public hate, a boy who is on the verge of starting his ventures, 
 
 just to prove what good citizens you both are to increase your fan following ?how dare you?? If you both really cared or bothered about cleanliness , then you would actively do something about all the garbage in your own lane
 
 you would make a noise and use your VOICE to urge the municipal authorities to take action atleast in the lane where you live,to start with, which you haven’t 
 Posting videos of fake bravado just to fool your followers
 If your intention was genuine then you would pull over and politely correct the person for littering IF THEY DID in a decent and real manner
 
 
 and not by displaying such a rude and arrogant attitude, and then posting it for the world to see! You have caused a lot of grief with your post & this is morally and humanitarianly very wrong
 You may be # anushkasharma or # viraatkohli in your house or on screen & the field
 
 
 but on the streets you are just a citizen trying to correct another
 
 
 DO IT WITH KINDNESS 
 
 
 
 fear karma 
 And just FYI, he did not react badly, not coz of who you both are
 
 we couldnt care less, but only because he has a decent upbringing! Unlike people like you, who seem to think that you are the empowered ones to talk and treat people as you wish! a post shared bygittanjali (@gittanjali

 Anushka was angry at the garbage dumper on the road, see VIDEO, if you had good intentions, you would have explained it well to spread garbage
 
 
 naa hi aisa ashisht or abhimaani bartaav karte or phir duniya ko dikhaane ke liye use soshal media par post karte
 You have hurt a lot from your post and it is human and morally wrong

 For your information, let me also say that he (arhan) did not give you the wrong answer
 
 
 isliye nahin ki aap star hai, hamen isaki parvaah nahin he
 
 
 But because she has been raised very well
 wo aapaki tarah nahin he jo sochate hai ki aaplog shashakt hai, jo kisi ko kaise bhi treet kar sakate hai
 Virushka's knowledge on cleanliness, got the answer- 'garbage came out of your mouth'
 Let me tell you that on 16 June, Virat Kohli wrote a video posting on his social media account - saw these people throwing garbage in the street and they were obstructed Took hands
 lagjri car main safar kar rahe hai or akl nahin he
 Will these people keep our country clean? Yes, of course
 agar aap aisa kuch galat hote hue dekhte hai to aisa hi kariye or jaagarukta failaaiye
 Saw these people throwing garbage on the road & pulled them up rightfully
 Travelling in a luxury car and brains gone for a toss
 These people will keep our country clean? Yeah right! If you see something wrong happening like this, do the same & spread awareness

 com / p8flrmcnba— Virat Kohli (@imvkohli)june 16, 2018iske baad kooda vaale arhan ne apane instagram par likhaa tha- disclemur: apane is post se mujhe shoharat paane kii koi ichha nahin he
 He further wrote - Horrible! i casually threw a small piece of plastic while driving
 paas se guzar rahi ek car kii khidki neeche hoti he
 Out of that, Anushka Sharma shouted like a roadside man
 main apni laaparvaahee ke liye maafee maangata hum, lekin anoushka sharma kii shabdon main agar thodaa tahjeeb hoti to usase wo choti star nahin ho jaatin
 There are many types of manners and cleanliness - one of them is the tone of conversation
 Disclaimer: i have no desire to gain any mileage from this post of mine
 
 
 Horrible! So i happened to carelessly Litter a sq mm of plastic while driving! a car passing by rolls their window down and there we have our wonderful @anushkasharma ranting and yelling like a crazy roadside person! While I'm apologetic for my carelessness, Mrs Anushka Sharma Kohli a little etiquette and politeness in ur dialogue wouldn't have made ua lesser star !! There are all kinds of manners and hygiene
 
 verbal etiquette is one of them! The garbage that mistakenly went out of the window of my "luxury car"
 
 
 Was way less then the garbage that came out from your mouth
 
 
 From ur "luxury car's" window
 
 
 Or the trashy mind @virat
 kohli to shoot and post this online
 
 
 For whatever gains
 
 
 Now thats some serious trash !!! a post shared byarhhan Singh (@arhhansingh) onjun 16, 2018 at 7:05 am PDT The trash that accidentally fell out of my luxury car was much less than the garbage that came out of your mouth
 
 
 aapke lagjri car kii khidki se

 ye sabase bada kachra he
 Commonwealth Games preparations seem to have become a game of scams
 sponcership ho yaa saamaanon kii kharid-bikri, sabamein gadabadi saaf dikhi he
 Till date, there is a big disclosure of the scam being made in the identification of the Games
 aaj tak ke paas maujuud dastavej bataate hai ki hai aam aadmi kii kamai pani kii tarah bah rahi he
 The cost of the Cricket World Cup card was 800 rupees
 olympic games card ko banane main 1000 rupye kaa kharch aayaa tha
 In terms of security, the most important parliamentary card costs Rs 2500, but the cards being made for the Commonwealth Games will cost around Rs 4000
 kaamanwealth khelon ke liye jo ai-card ban rahaa he, uskaa kharch 4000 rupye hi aana he
 The organizing committee has entrusted the company named Gold Medal System to make 50 thousand cards for about Rs 20 crore
 ab jaraa is qaraar ke andar kii kahani bhi sun lijie
 Till date the highlights of the review meeting of the Sports Organizing Committee are present
 dastavejon se saaf he ki shuru main is kaam ke liye sirf teen companiyaan hi saamne ain thi
 Till the last time, the remaining two companies had not applied and one company, which had submitted its claim, had given only seven days to the organizing committee to take a decision
 matlab saaf he ki ai-card jaise ahm mudde par bhi aakhri vakt main faisla liya gaya tha
 Now the biggest question in this game of i-cards is why the other two companies withdrew their hands
 jab aaj tak ne ye sawaal un donon companiyon se kiya, to unki taraf se koi jawaab hi nahin mila
 The career graph of Bollywood actor Varun Dhawan is going up very fast
 unhone ab tak kul 14 filmein kii hai jinamein se sirf 2 flop hui hai
 These days she is busy shooting for the film Coolie Number One, directed by her father David Dhawan
 ye film saal 1995 main relies hui govinda starer film kii rimek he jisamen varun ke saath sara ali khan bhi najar aaengi
 The shooting of the film is going on in Maharashtra and recently something happened during the shoot which halted everyone's beats for a moment
 darasal hua ye ki film ke ek stant seen kii shooting pune ke bahari ilaake main chal rahi thi
 The scene was such that a car had to hang upside down from a steep rock and Varun Dhawan had to be in this car
 sab kuch sahi ja rahaa tha tabhi kuch aisa hua jisaki ummid kisi ne nahin kii thi
 During the shoot, Varun Dhawanclose arrived on the set of Clean Shave Kara as he had to give some closeup shots
 vah gaadi ke andar the or gaadi chattan se latak rahi thi
 Varun practiced all this with the stunt directors and stunt coordinators in the safe zone many times but still one thing got messed up during the real shot
 car kaa darwaja atak gaya or kai baar koshish karne par bhi ye nahin khul rahaa tha
 Worried not, Varun dhawanstant Coordinators took Varun Dhawan safely out of the car after a lot of struggle
 ek sutara ke mutabik, "varun dhawan is puure ghatnakram ke dauraan kaaphi shant bane rahe
 The problem was also happening because the car was hanging on the side
 haalanki aakhirkaar stant cordinator varun ko surakshit nikaal paane main kaamyaab rahe
 " congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne apane diwaali sandesh main modi sarkaar ko rajdharm kii yaad dilaai he
 Attacking the government, Sonia Gandhi specifically raised questions about the current situation of farmers
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kii kisaan virdohi nitiyon kii vajah se desh ke kisaan is diwaali ko 'kaali diwaali' ke taur par manaane ko majaboor hai
 Due to the government, the farmers are not even getting the minimum support price fixed by the government for their crops
 bataa den ki nunatam samarthan main vah raashi he jisapar sarkaar kisaanon se fasal kharidti he
 Sonia Gandhi also reminded the Modi government of the promise made by her last year in which she had spoken about giving 50% higher minimum support price to farmers
 congress adhyaksh ne kaha ki aaj sthiti yah he ki kisaanon ko apni kharif kii fasal sarkaar dwaara tay nunatam samarthan mulya se 22
 Have to sell at 5% less price
 sarkaar kii is niti se kisaanon ko 50 hajaar karod rupee kaa nuksaan hua he
 He said that the BJP government had started working on the policy of cheating farmers with the coming of power
 sonia gandhi ne sarkaar par kisaani se judi chizon par jiesti lagane kaa bhi virodh kiya
 At the same time, he also termed the increase in the price of diesel on the day
 unhone kaha ki iskaa sidhaa asar kisaanon kii aay par padataa he
 Let us know that the Congress is going through the biggest crisis at this time

 What will be the benefits of postponement of FDI in retail sector or what will be the loss of arrival? On this subject, Aaj Tak asked people for their opinion on Facebook, whose response openly expressed their opinion
 prastut he kuch chune hue vichaar
 Ravikiran Yatageri: Small industries are already in trouble, unemployment will increase further if FDI is applied
 Tarak Patel:retail main epadiai se koi phayda nahin he
 Lakhs of jobs are lost for only a few new jobs
 iskaa koi matlab nahin he
 By looking at other countries, you can learn that there is no use
 Pranali Pokale:retail epadiai talane se phayda or aane se nuksaan hi hoga aisa nahin he
 Prabhakar Dixit: i believe that any foreign company will do business for its own benefit, it will not make any sense to the interests of the Indian public, which structure FDI will develop here
 Megh Gholap:bhartiya retail sector har saal 15 pratishat kii growth dikhaa rahaa he, isliye FDI kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 If the government still wants to bring, then their raw material (at least 85 percent) or product should be Indian
 Rahul Jha:keval epadiai nahin, balki videshi companiyon ko ye nirdesh diya janaa chahie ki wo kam se kam 50 fisadi kaccha maal bhartiya companiyon kaa hi istemaal karen
 Anvesh Khan Bhardwaj: America has an experience - a mall at a Walmart in a city earns 84 percent of the small shopkeepers' earnings
 or phir bharat or america main antar he
 Here, more than 80 percent of the people are full of labor force, they have survived this loss
 ek mal kitne logon ko rojgaar detaa? 1000? par ek mal 1000 pariwaron kaa rojgaar chin kar banataa
 At least 4 people in a family
 ek shahar main ek lakh logon kaa rojgaar jaataa or unamem se kaaphi anpadh bhi hai
 Does the mall provide one lakh jobs in a city? Abhinay Jain: FDI is good and people should understand its benefits
 sarkaar ke is kadam se mahangaai par bahut had tak kaabo paaya ja saktaa he
 But politics affects people's thinking and they are unable to think about its benefits
 mujhe lagata he ki tivi channelon ko is mudde par logon ko shikshit karnaa chahie
 Anand Mishra: i think that even if there is any benefit from FDI, only big industries will benefit from it, small industries and farmers will not benefit from it
 agar rojgaar kii baat karen to ye sach he ki isse rojgaar ke avasar milenge lekin ham is baat ko bhi nakaar nahin sakate ki 50 fisadi se zyada log is epadiai ke kaaran berozegaar ho jaaenge or keval 10 se 15 pratishat logon ko hi isse rojgaar mil sakegaa
 There was no idea that the king of the forest and his clan would get such a death
 puure desh main sher (aciatic line) mahaj gujarat ke gir ke jangalon main bache hai or gujarat sarkaar ise apane gaurav kii tarah pesh karti he
 The case has become serious with the death of 14 lions including two adult lions, five adult lionesses and seven cubs in the Dalkhania range of Gir Forest National Park in Amreli district from September 12 to 25
 inamen ek sherni kii ilaaj ke dauraan maut ho gai
 Immediately after these deaths, Gujarat government's forest minister Ganpat Vasava claimed that these deaths took place in a mutual struggle to establish supremacy over the area
 pradhan mukhya van sangrakshak (pisisief) e
 K
 saxena kehete hai, "in mauton ke peeche koi chhipaane vaali yaa rahasyamay baat nahin he
 But when environmentalists expressed doubts over the death of so many lions in a mutual battle for supremacy in the area in such a short time, the state government cautions
 is ghatana se gujarat sarkaar ke supreme court main kiye us daawey par bhi sawalia nishaan khadey hue hai ki uske soobe main sher puri tarah surakshit hai
 After realizing the seriousness of the case, the state government sought the help of the central government to find out the secret of these deaths
 gujarat kii guhaar par 23 sitambar ko vanya jeev visheshgyon kii ek kendriya team, jiske do sadasyon main rashtriya baagh sangrakshan praadhikaran ke assistant inspector general dow
 Rajaram Sher and Joint Director R
 gopinath (vanya jeev) shaamil hai, ne gir jangalon kaa daura kiya
 He has advised the state to get any infection tested in 45 other lions present in the area
 is do sadasyeey team ne rajya sarkaar se yah bhi kaha ki in sheron ke sharir ke namoonay neshnal institute of vyrology (enivi), pune or neshnal institute of haai security animal dijis, bhopal ko bhi bhejein taaki maut ke kaarnon kaa spasht rup se pataa lagaaya ja sake
 Autopsy and viscera report of the killed lions are now awaited
 kendriya team ke daure ke baad vaasava ne saaf kiya he ki is range main maujuud sabhi 45 sheron kii jaanch karwaai ja rahi he
 Apart from this, after the visit of the central team, the Gujarat government was seen to be moving fast and has started a rapid investigation by dividing the force of 270 members of the Gujarat Forest Department into 54 teams
 ye sabhi timen gir main maujuud sheron main kisi beemaari ke lakshanon kii jaanch karengi
 Each team includes a forester, two beat guards and a lion tracker
 in tiimon ko agar koi sher biimaar miltaa he to ye unhen fouran upachaar uplabdh karaayengi
 The scope of their work will be 259 square kilometers of Gir National Park and 1,153 square kilometers in its vicinity, which is considered as the natural habitat of lions
 vaise, gir main sheron kii sankchaya main lagaataar badhotaree dekhi gai he
 Another PCCF g
 ke
 Sinha says, "as per the 2015 census, the total number of lions in Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Amreli and Bhavnagar districts was 523 as compared to 411 in 2010
 yani paanch saal main singhon kii aabaadi main k reeb 27 fisadi kii badhotaree dekhi gai
 Five of the forest sites here are Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, Gir National Park, Girnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Matiala Sanctuary and Pania Sanctuary
 in sabko milakar puure gir kshetra main 300 singhon ke rahane laayak kshetra or shikaar uplabdh hai
 Hence, from 1995 onwards, when the population of lions exceeded the capacity, they started coming out of Gir
 visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki gir ke aasapaas ke ilaakon main maanviya gatividhiyon main bhi takreeban 20 fisadi kaa ijapha hua he
 The late Gujarat government is right, but the boom in functioning points to another outcome of the event
 jaankaar sheron kii is maut ko nasl par aane vaale kisi sambhavit khatre se bhi jod rahe hai jiskaa ek sira gujarat sarkaar kii us jid se atka he jisamen yah suba apane sheron ko madhya pradesh ke kuno-palpur jangalon main nahin bheje jane par ada hua he
 If it is proved that this death of lions is due to some disease or they are not completely safe in Gir, then Gujarat's argument of not giving lion to kuno-palpur will be weakened in the Supreme Court
 asal main, 1986 main centre sarkaar ne asian sheron ko ek or rahavaas muhaiyaa karaane kii garaj se kuno-palpur abhayaarany kaa chayan kiya tha taaki kisi mahamari yaa prakritik aapadaa kii sthiti main sheron ke astitv ko bachaaya ja sake
 kuno-palpur is a forest spread across the Shivpuri and Sheopur districts of Madhya Pradesh, where the conditions are favorable for lions' habitat
 gujarat sarkaar shuru se is yojana ke virodh main thi, jabaki madhya pradesh van vibhaag ne kuno-palpur main sheron ko basaane kii pariyojna taiyaar kar lee or van ke kor kshetra main rahane vaali aadim janajati sahariya ke kareeb 1,500 pariwaron ko saal 2002-03 ke bich visthapit bhi kar diya
 But in the year 2004, the Gujarat government refused to give the first clan of 19 lions opposing this decision of the Center
 uskaa tark tha ki uske prabhavi sangrakshan kaarykram kii vajah se sheron kii aabaadi main badhotaree hui he isliye sheron par sirf usee kaa haq he
 After a long legal battle, in April 2016, the Supreme Court ordered the Gujarat government to send some lions to kuno-palpur in the larger interest of wildlife conservation
 par is par bhi gujarat sarkaar ne rivyuu peetishan daayar kar rakhi he or uskaa tark he ki gujarat main singh puri tarah surakshit hai
 Despite the stubborn attitude of Gujarat and all the arguments, the fact is that according to the state government itself, some 184 lions have died in the last two years
 gujarat vidhansabha main isi saal march main apane ek likhit uttar main van mantri ganpat vaasava ne mana ki inamen se 32 sheron kii maut aprakritik thi
 Although Vasava did not mention the reasons for the unnatural deaths, experts say that lion deaths are common due to poisoning, vehicles, and train collision and falling into unsuspecting wells
 iske alaava, sheron kii maut saanp kaatane, ufanti nadi main bahane or jangalon ke kinare lagaae bijli vaale taron se karant lagane se bhi hoti he jo apane maweshiyon ko bachaane ke liye gaanvvaalon ne lagaae hai
 Officially it is believed that 60 percent of the deaths of lions in wildlife are natural
 vaise, gujarat hycourt dwaara emicas curi banaae gaye vakil hemang shah ne adaalat main singhon ke bachaav ke liye ek masauda pesh kiya he, jo avaidh khanan rokane, aasapaas ke ilaakon main bijli vaali barbandi par roak, har 500 meter par camera or speedgan lagane jaisi siforishein kar chuke hai
 But, an environmentalist, on the condition of anonymity, states, "illegal mining in the Gir area is also a cause of death for lions and the government has not taken effective measures to curb illegal mining and encroachments
" in abhayaaranyon ke aasapaas kukuramutton kii tarah ug aae resort bhi sheron ke rahavaas ko sikodate ja rahe hai
 "actually, Indian or Asiatic lions, who were separated from their African communities a million years ago, are left here
 agar tanzania kii tarah kisi beemaari se in sheron ke jivan par khatra aata he to yah nasl puri tarah khatm ho jaaegi
 The death of 14 lions within ten days raises many questions
 suraksha or beemaari se bachaav ke saath hi badhati sankhya kii samasya se nibatane ke liye sheron ko kuno-palpur abhayaarany ko dene main kya harj he? gujarat ke liye ab apni jid par ade rahanaa mushkil hoga
 Lions in Chattashera are found only in Gir in Asia
 The five forested areas of the city are inhabited by lions
 According to the 2015 census, the total number of lions in the country was 523

 Just before the assembly elections in Delhi, the infighting of the Aam Aadmi Party is now emerging on the surface
 party ke ek purv vidhayak ne gambhir aarope lagaate hue is chunaav main AAP ke tikat par chunaav na ladane kaa elaan kiya he
 Harish Khanna, who was an AAP MLA from Timarpur in Delhi in the dissolved assembly, has created more heat in the politics just before the elections

 He said that he would continue to work for it by staying in the party

 However, many Twitter users are unhappy with this
 kuch yugers ko iskaa nayaa luk pasand nahin aa rahaa he
 In such a situation, if you want, you can still use the old Twitter interface
 Twitter ke nae interphes main kaaphi bade badlaav hai or isamen kuch khaas fitures bhi hai jo yugers ke liye phydemand hai
 However, Twitter has not mentioned any way through which you can move from the new Twitter to the old Twitter interface
 ham aapako do tareeke bataate hai jisase aap puraane Twitter yujar interphes main ja sakate hai
 This is the first method
 iske tahat aap log out hone se pehle yaa Twitter band karne se pehle tak yuj kar paaenge

 --- Twitter log in karke More par clic karen yaa profile ke left said main milegaa
 --- Select Settings and Privacy Options Here you will find many options
 --- About Twitter opshan select karen
 --- Directory option will appear in the list on the right, select here
 ab aap home teb par clic kar sakate hai
 By doing this you will notice that the old Twitter profile is visible
 yani yujar interphes purana vaala ho jayega
 But as soon as you close this tab or log out, you will be on the new Twitter again
 doosraa opshan main third party extansion he
 That is, for this you will have to download and set an extension in the Google Chrome browser
 goodtwitter naam kaa extansion he
 Apart from Chrome, it is also in Firefox
 ise downlod karke install karne ke baad Twitter open karenge to purana hi yujar interphes khulegaa
 It is up to you whether you will use a third party extension or not
 aaj tak tech aise kii bhi extansion ko install karne kii salaah nahin detaa he

 a young woman is going towards her department of Allahabad University with fast steps
 umr hogi yahi koi 24 saal
 It has been seven months since he was enrolled for his phd
 purab kaa oxford kahi jane vaali is uniwarsity ko lekar uske sapane jaise hakeekat se takaraakar har din chakanachur ho rahe hai
 She says, "coming to your own department at university is like coming to the battlefield everyday
 ” or use is sthiti main kisi dushman ne nahin, uske apane research guide or professor ne daalaa he
 Her guides are a respected scholar and give lectures in seminars around the country and the world, but they have another face as the students pass
 vah bataati he, “ve mujhe sex kaa khulaa prastaav de chuke hai
 With the fascination that phd will be quick and good and they will also recommend for lecturership
 ” saath hi yah chhipi dhamkee bhi ki agar vah raji nahin hui to kariyar chapat samajhe
 Three months ago, a phd student at another central university, Kashi Hindu University, accused her research guide of wrongly touching her body and making lewd gestures
 uski shikaayat thi ki professor ne gale lagane ke bahaane uske seene par haath rakh diya
 The complaint reached the Gender Cell of the university, but instead of taking any action, this department, which was set up to stop sexual harassment , suppressed the case by making the girl understandable and slightly intimidated
 or ladki ko samajhane or daraane kii jimmedaari vivi kii mahila prophessoron ne uthaai
 Have Indian universities and higher education institutions turned into one of the biggest sexual harassment centers in the country, where the sexual harassment of teachers is hurting female students? This is uncomfortable, but the truth is that nothing is sacred in the relationship between the teacher and the disciple who are called holy
 aise maamalon par lagaataar najar rakhane vaali mumbai ke tata institute of soshal sycenge kii professor aashaa vaajapeyi kahati hai, “shiksha parisaron main yon utpeeda ke bahut gambhir maamle bhi kabhi-kabhaar hi saamne aa pate hai
 All this is happening on a large scale in everyday life, but girls often do not open their mouths and whenever such a case comes to the fore, an investigation committee tries to set up the case
 ” darasal yah maan liya gaya he ki yon utpeeda utana bura nahin he, jitna ki maamle kaa saamne aana kyonki isse badanaami fail jaati he
 a campus survey recently led by Professor Ayesha Kidwai conducted a survey on female students at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, which showed that 96 per cent of the girls had been sexually assaulted in some form within the campus
 sabase khatarnaak baat yah he ki 63 fisadi chaatraon ne purush shikshakon par sexual harasment or mahilaon ke khilaaf abhadra tippanee karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 It is not that the matter is always suppressed
 jab pani sir se guzar jaae to kai baar ladakiyon ko majabuuran shikaayat kerani padati he
 In some cases, Professor Sahab has also had to give up his job, in some cases even arrest has occurred (see box)
 lekin aisa kam hi hota he
 One and a half years ago in Patna University, a Sexual Harassment Complex Committee was formed
 isaki adhyaksh professor bharti es
 Kumar proudly states that he has not had any complaints of sexual harassment till now
 to kya patna uniwarsity main chaatraon ko saath aisa kuch nahin hota
 The second truth of the university comes out when talking to girls
 hindi se eme kar rahi chaatra aarti (badla hua naam) kahati hai, “teacher class room main hi ladakiyon ko ajeeb tarah se ghoorte rahete hai
 Knowing where to teach Nirala or any poet, we get out of sex talks
 unhen sahitya ke naam par ek hi ras padhaanaa aata he- shringaar ras
 "A student of MA second year, on the condition of anonymity, says," The teacher calls in the office at a time when there is no one there and then talks dirty
 hamen dar lagata he lekin shikaayat kisase karen
 If you reach home, you will get rid of your studies and get married
 ”isi uniwarsity se maas communications main grajuation kar rahi 24 varshiya divya gautam gusse main kahati hai, “awwal to ladkiyaan dari rahati hai
 Then even if they want, where to complain
 sexual harasment compline cameti kaa na to koi offis he na phone number
 The girls have not even been told that there is any such committee
 ”tumhaari shikaayat—tumhiin doshagar sexual herracement kii koi shikaayat aa bhi jaae to puraa jor maamle ko rafa-dfa karne par hota he
 The mentality of the teachers is such that the blame lies only on the girls and they should be saved
 magadh college kii gender cell kii sadsy dow
 Suheli Mehta says, "girls should stay within their own limits
 magadh college kii chaatraon ko patna college main ghoomane kii bhala kya jarurat he?” yah maansikta desh bhar ke vishvavidhyalayon main he
 28-year-old Durgesh Chauhan, who is pursuing phd from Allahabad University, says, "if a student has a boyfriend or she talks to boys easily, consider her right to complain of sexual harassment
 teacher taane kasenge ki is ladki kii chaar ladakon se dosti he, iskaa to khud kaa hi kairactor thik nahin he
 "A professor who was a proctor till recently at Allahabad University used to drive girls away on any such complaint that you guys hang around with boys, although they say in their explanation that" i always helped girls
 ”yon utpeeda se bachane kaa daayitv bhi aksar ladakiyon par hi daal diya jaataa he
 Dr
 SNDT University of Mumbai, which has done research on sexual harrassment of female students in educational institutions
 vinaa punacha kahati hai “koi bhi shahar ho yaa koi bhi shiksha santhaan, sexual harasment kii shikaayat karne vaali chaatra kaa charitra hi sabase pehle andeh ke daayre main hota he
 If the student is free and is a feminist or wears jeans, if she has a boyfriend or is divorced, then the girl is considered as the culprit instead of the sexual harasser
 ”bhartiya vishvavidhyalayon main aise maamle ab lagaataar saamne aa rahe hai, lekin nyaay vyavastha yaa vishvavidhyalay kii aantarik vyavastha koi aisa udhaaharan nahin pesh kar paa rahi he, jisase yon pipaasu prophessoron ko koi sabak mili
 Such masters have to face the maximum mandatory retirement penalty if the matter is not suppressed and the world gets thrashed
 dilli uniwarsity main ek chaatra kaa yon utpeeda karne ke aarope main professor ajay tiwari ko anivaary sevanivritti par bhej diya gaya, vahiin biechayu ke associat professor narendra kumaar kii seva khatm karne kii jagah unhen sirf suspend kiya gaya
 BD Bhatia, a professor in the pediatric department of BHU, was also decided to retire forcibly following a complaint by a student
 jeenyu main bhi apni student kaa yon utpeeda karne ke aaropee prafesar ke
 R
 nair ko jabaran sevanivritti par bhej diya gaya
 In the form of forced retirement, universities have found a way in which the honor of the university is saved and the teacher gets all the post-retirement benefits comfortably
 chaatr badal gaye-master nahin badalebhartiya vishvavidhyalayon main haal ke varshon main baari badlaav aayaa he
 a large number of girls are now coming to higher education
 kai vishvavidhyalayon main piechdi scolers kii sankhya ko dekhen to ladkiyaan ab ladakon se aage nikal chuki hai
 For example, in the year 2011-12, a total of 475 students were given phd degrees at Lucknow University, of which 249 are girls and 226 are boys
 jis tarah shiksha main piechdi tak pahunchane vaali ladakiyon kaa aankada badal gaya, kya usee tarah kya shikshakon ke aankade main bhi koi badlaav aayaa he? aankade bataate hai ki vishvavidhyalayon ke teachers staff room abhi bhi purushon ke adde hai
 This university has only 120 female teachers as against 276 male teachers
 staff room main mahilaon kii kam sankhya kii vajah se purush shikshakon main mardwaadi ashleel chutkule sunne-sunaane or gaaliyaan bakne aadi kaa chalan khatm nahin ho rahaa he
 As long as both the teacher and the students were male, the incidence of sexual harassment on campus was either low or buried
 ab chaatraon kii sankhya badaae ke saath sthiti nirnaayak rup se badali he
 Since almost all cases of sexual harassment, except for exceptions, remain hidden, no comparative study of data is possible
 lekin itnaa to saaf he ki ab chaatraon main shikaayat karne kaa hausala badha he
 The widespread atmosphere being created in the country against sexual harassment has also affected the campus and now it is being talked about openly
 zyaadaatar vishvavidhyalayon ne gender cell banaae hai or aupchaarikta ke liye hi sahi, par unhone kaam karnaa shuru kar diya he
 This is a significant change in the fact that students are now starting to do phds in larger numbers than students
 iskaa asar shikshakon kii sankhya par padana chahie
 But this is not happening
 isaki sabase badi vajah yah he ki shikshakon ke dabaav kii vajah se unki riatarment age badhaakar 65 saal kar di gai he or retarment ke baad bhi reeimployament or yahaan tak ki emritus professor jaise kai tareekon se shikshak vishvavidhyalayon se jude rahete hai
 Because of this, new posts are not coming and instead of filling the positions which are coming, University Temperry and Adhoc are working with teachers
 temprari, edock or lachaarshiksha sansthaanon main temprari taur par kii jane vaali niyuktiyaan yon shoshan kii badi vajah hai

 K
 aroda ke yon shoshan se tang aa chuki thi
 He was admitted to Maulana Azad Medical College, where he died a week later
 thane se lekar dilli uniwarsity ke sexual herracement compline cell ‘apeks cameti’ tak aisa koi darwaja nahin bachaa tha, jo usne na khatkhataya ho par kahin sunwaayee na hui
 He finally took this step
 jamini sachai yah he ki temprari shikshak or karmchaaree apni naukari jari rakhane ke liye vivi prashasan or prophessoron par buree tarah nirbhar hote hai
 The relationship between them is highly undemocratic and many male teachers take advantage of it
 misaal ke taur par dilli uniwarsity or sambandhit collejon main takreeban 6,500 sthaayee shikshakon ke mukaable 4,000 temprari teachers hai
 Temporary teachers work from 40,000 to 45,000 rupees per month, but apart from this they do not get any other facilities like medical and holidays etc
 unka contract sirf 4 maheene kaa hota he or contract rinual bhi college kii dayaa par nirbhar hota he
 In Lucknow University, about 35 teachers are on adhawk in some self-finance courses, who get salary of Rs 25,000 to 35,000
 iske alaava kuch teacher asinament contract par bhi hote hai, jinhen 250 se 500 rupye prati lacture die jate hai
 The possibility of ever becoming permanent will force these women teachers to bow down and bear everything
 yah tamaam kism ke shoshan kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 In fact, the equations of undemocratic power present in relationships with female students and ad hoc women teachers are providing an open ground for exploitation for men

 There have been reports of a scuffle between 2 mps on Friday at Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi
 aarope he ki AIADMK saansad shashikala puspa ne DMK ke saansad tiruchi shiva ko saream thappad maar diya
 It is being told that the DMK MP had made some comments against Tamil Nadu CM j Jayalalithaa, after which Sasikala slapped her
 dilli airport kii ghatnakhabaron ke mutabik donon saansadon ke bichadilli airportke terminal-3 par ye bhidnt hui, jiske baad airport main maujuud CISF ke javaanon ne donon ko alag kiya, donon ek hi flite se chennai jane vaale the
 But after this accident, Siva left Gate No
 2 and returned to his home in Delhi, while Sasikala left for Chennai
 diemke saansad par jayalalita ke khilaaf tippanee karne kaa aaropis haadase ke baad saansadashashikala pushpane kaha, 'main ammaa (jayalalita) ke khilaaf kuch nahin sun sakati
 Tiruchi Siva commented on our leader, after which, in anger we slapped Siva 4 '
 vahiin diemke saansad tiruchi shiva kaa aarope he ki sabase pehle shashikala ne hi unke khilaaf coment kiya or phir jab uskaa jawaab diya to unhone saream thappad maar diya
 People present at the airport were surprised by this incident
 vah 2005 ke sitambar kii barsaat thi
 Light rain had started in Mumbai
 bisisiai ke adhyaksh ranbir mahindra ne aam sabha bulaai thi
 Sharad Pawar of Maharashtra politics also reached
 kisi ko nahin pataa tha ki aage kya hone vaala he
 Not even when Pawar openly challenged the chairmanship of Mahindra and demanded fresh elections
 sabko laga ki pavaar mazaaq kar rahe hai kyonki sava saal pehle hi jagmohan daalamia ne pavaar ko adhyaksh ke chunaav main zindagi kii pehali haar kaa swaad chakhaaya tha
 Mahindra was Dalmia's candidate
 aam sabha ke tisare din voting kaa faisla hua
 Today's IPL Commissioner Rajiv Shukla was considered to be Dalmiya's right hand
 voting kii subah tak rajeev shukla daalamia ke saath gum rahe the
 But when the results came four hours later, Rajiv Shukla took the first picture of the victory celebration with Sharad Pawar
 sharad pavaar kii is jeet ne bhartiya cricket ke niyantran ke muhaavarey hi badalakar rakh die
 In 1980, the journey of the summit of the equations NKP Salve made in Maratha politics in cricket had begun
 akhir cricket kii company main aisa kya tha jiskaa chaska raajnneeti ke chatur chaakaron ko ek baar laga to unhen mazaa aa gaya
 From Madhav Rao Scindia to Narendra Modi
 isaki do badi vajahen thim
 One is the bliss of open market chaos and the other is complete freedom from accountability towards the people or the country
 cricket is desh kaa aisa iklauta khel he jo puri tarah munaafe kii lakeer par chalane ke baavjood rashtrawaad kaa jowar paidaa karata he
 Such a system immediately attracts leaders
 1990 main madhav raav sindhiya jab bisisiai ke adhyaksh bane the to logon ne ise vaqt kii barbaadi kaha tha
 But in the journey from Scindia to Shukla, the needle of time has turned at an angle of 180 degrees
 954 karod kii bisisiai naam kii company rajanetaaon ke liye swapnlok kaa dwaar ban chuki he
 Unbelievable money, stars in fists, market palm and your own coin
 ipel ke astitv main aane ke baad cricket kaa kaarobaar bhi badha he or niyantran kaa vistaar bhi hua he
 It is worth noting that with this expansion, the land of responsibility and morality has shrunk
 isiilie ipel kaa mahangaa namak khaane vaale navjot singh siddhu ko kahana padataa he ki jab bhrashton se bhari sansad pavitra bani hui he to do-chaar khilaadiyon ke phixing main funsane se ipel daagi kaise ho gai
 This is not surprising
 sansadeey bhrashtachar par ek duusare ko nipta dene kii kasame khaane vaale cricket kii kalank katha main apratyaashit rup se ek duusare kii dhaal ban gaye hai
 Everyone knows that in cricket politics they can move forward only by embracing each other, not by cutting each other's throat
 kya yah achaanak he ki bhrashtachar par rail mantri pawan bansal or kanoon mantri ashvini kumaar kii bali ke liye sarkaar ko majaboor kar dene vaale arun jetali ko ipel kii vyavastha nishpaap or nirdosh donon nazar aati he
 Jaitley is the chairman of the bcci's disciplinary committee, but neither asked for his resignation nor offered his resignation
 log bataate hai ki jetali bisisiai adhyaksh kii kursi par nazar gadaaye baithe hai
 He knows that he cannot get this chair without the jugaad of N
 Srinivasan and Rajiv Shukla
 isliye unhone chuppi main naitikta kii tuutati varjanaaon kaa vikalp dhund liya
 When the police reached Srinivasan's house, Jaitley went to meet Rajiv Shukla on Thursday
 bijepi ke mukhar saansad kirti azaad ne jab sidhe-sidhe rajeev shukla ke istife kii maang kar daali to unheen kii party ke saathiyon ne unhen bura-bhala kaha
 The President of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, Anurag Thakur, gave an immediate clean chit to all the tainters saying that it is very wrong to call someone a speculator or a fixer without proving the charge
 gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko sonia gandhi ke ilaaj ke karche tak main gadabadi nazar aati he lekin rajeev shukla ke netritv vaale ipel main koi khot nazar nahin aata
 This is because before Rajiv Shukla, Arun Jaitley or N
 Srinivasan, he remembers that he is also the president of the Gujarat Cricket Association
 cricket ke bhaichaare kaa fevicol raajnneeti kii dushmani kii daraaron ko aise bhar detaa he ki ek bhi chhed chhot na jaae
 This brotherhood also plays Modi and also Pawar, Jaitley and Rajiv Shukla
 imaan ke naam par rail mantralay kaa inaam hasil karne vaale rajasthan cricket sangh ke adhyaksh seepi joshi dubkee markar yun hi nahin baithe hue hai
 Amidst this uproar, Jyotiraditya Scindia did not let anyone know that he was also the chairman of the bcci's most powerful financial committee
 purv bihar cricket sangh ke bhootpurv adhyaksh lalu yadav to vaise bhi vichaar kii bajaay vyakti main nishthaaon ke liye vikhyath rahe hai
 That is why no one vowed to drag N
 Srinivasan on the road and neither gave morality to Rajiv Shukla
 rajanetaaon ke bich aisi durlabh ekta kaa avishkaar sirf cricket kar saktaa he
 It is still to be discovered that why the game of Sharifs became dirty with the interference of cricket leaders
 jahaan netaa nahin aa sake vahaan unke pasandida naukarshah aage bade or nahin to udyogpati
 These deadly trio of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen are seeing the blood of this game in public
 aisa keval cricket ke saath nahin he
 Suresh Kalmadi not only earned a name in the Commonwealth, but also ruined the Indian Olympic Association
 boxing ko abhaya chautaala ne apni jaagir bana rakhaa he, yashavanth sinha tennis chhodane ko taiyaar nahin hai, prafull patel footbal sangh ko thokar par rakhe hue hai to teerandaazi raajnneeti ke asafal nishanebaaz vijay kumaar malhotra kii aghoshit milqiyat he
 The eyes of the politicians on cricket were more kind because there is more money in it, more glamor and more opportunities to get the status quo
 zyaada kii is jaagir main kisi bhi tarah kaa bantwaaraa kisi ko bardaasht nahin
 It is the charisma of the leaders that despite thousands of types of rigging, the government could neither prepare the BCCI for public auditing, nor bring it under the Right to Information nor within the scope of Lokpal or Lokayukta
 aantarik loktantr ke naam par bisisiai kii araajaktaa ko sweekaar kar lenaa sarkaar or janata donon kii anivaary majaburi rahi he
 Finally return to IPL
 phixing or sattebaazi par jaanch kaa dayera jaise-jaise bada ho rahaa he vaise-vaise is shrishanth, chavaan or chandila ek badi saazish ke chote mohare main sikudte ja rahe hai
 The game in which the wages of losing is thousands of times more expensive than winning, even if it kept the game tied to morality
 yah sari chizein thik ho sakati hai lekin nahin hongi
 There is a solid reason for this
 jabatak rajanetaaon main khel bhaavana thi vah thik chalati rahi lekin jis din khel raajnneeti kii bhaavana se khele jane lage usee din se khot shuru ho gaya
 At the moment, it seems very difficult to change this mode
 chunaav main apane paksh main vot dene ke liye votaron ko kharidne ke maamle to aksar saamne aate rahe hai, lekin vot na dene ke liye paise baante jane kaa maamla shaayad hi pehle suna ho
 Voting is going on today for the last phase of Lok Sabha elections 2019
 haalanki isse pehle hi ek hairaan karne vaala maamla saamne aayaa he
 Where the finger of the Dalits was inked even before voting
 iske saath hi unhen paise bhi die gaye
 The case is of Chandauli Lok Sabha seat of Uttar Pradesh
 jahaan vot na dene ke liye note baantne kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 People of Dalit colony in Tarajivanpur village of Chandauli Lok Sabha have accused BJP workers of distributing money for not voting
 dalit basti ke logon ne sattadhari dal par aarope lagaaya he ki vot na dene ke liye unako na sirf paise die gaye balki unki ungaliyon par chunaav main istemaal kii jaani vaali syaahi bhi laga di gai taaki wo vot na de sake
 People allege that the voters were given 500-500 rupees and asked not to vote
 udhar note baant kar vot na dene kaa maamla jaise hi saamne aayaa to sakaldiha vidhansabha ke samaajawaadee party ke vidhayak prabhu narayan singh yadav or samaajawaadee party ke pratyaashee dow
 Dozens of Samajwadi Party activists, including Sanjay Chauhan, reached the Alinagar police station in Chandauli district and sat on the dharna encircling the police station
 samaajawaadee party ke netaa or kaaryakarta is baat kii maang kar rahe the ki jin logon ne paisa dekar matadhikaar ke prayog ko rokane kii koshish kii un par karrwai kii jaae
 On the other hand, the district administration has investigated the matter and asked for action
 haalanki is maamle main police ne teen logon ke khilaaf maamla darj kar liya he

 However, it has now been proposed that in the future, a three-fourth majority in the AGM would be sufficient to approve any amendment to the constitution as it would not be practical to get the approval of the Supreme Court which is necessary according to the current constitution

 There is a thrilling turn in the politics of Karnataka
 224 siton vaali vidhansabha main ek nirdaleey vidhayak ke paala badalane se bhartiya janata party (bijepi) kaa aankada 107 pahunch gaya he
 Independent MLA r Shankar has supported the BJP, giving a jolt to the Kumaraswamy government
 congress party ke saath vilay kar vidhayak bane aar shankar kaa istipha kaaphi ahm mana ja rahaa he
 He has withdrawn his support from the coalition
 karnataka main congress-jedies vidhayakon ke istife se paidaa hua sankat nirdaleey vidhayak nagesh ke sarkaar se samarthan waapas lene or vidhayak aar shankar ke istipha dene se or gaharaa gaya he
 At the same time, the number of mlas involved in support of BJP has increased to 107
 ab ek or vidhayak ne kumaraswami sarkaar kaa saath chhodkar bijepi main shaamil hone kii baat kahi he
 MLA Roshan Baig said that Bharatiya Janata Party is also a political party, what is the harm in going with BJP
 is bich, kumaraswami kii sarkaar ko bachaane ke liye dike sivakumar bengalooru se mumbai ravaanaa ho gaye hai, jabaki nirdaleey vidhayak ke saath sabhi 13 baagi vidhayak mumbai se goa ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye hai
 All 14 mlas are going to Goa from Mumbai by road
 bataa den ki kumaraswami ne sabhi baagi vidhayakon ko mantri pad ofer kar diya he
 Now to save the government, Congress and JDS have adopted the formula of cabinet reshuffle by resigning their ministers
 congress ne apane 22 mantriyon kaa istipha dilaakar nayaa daanv chalaa to vahiin kumaraswami ko chhodkar jedies ke sabhi 11 mantriyon ne bhi istipha de diya he
 The effort is to create a new cabinet and the crisis will be eradicated by making the dissidents ministers

 In the last assembly elections, BJP had replaced Vijay Goel and projected Harshavardhan with a clean image

 Against Kejriwal, BJP has fielded Nupur Sharma, who was the president of Delhi University
 pichhali baar isi seat par (tab gol market) kejariwal ne teen baar mukhyamantri rah chukin shila dikshit ko shikast di thi
 To say that the 31-year-old Nupur is the young face of the BJP and has been included in the 10 inspirational women of Hindustan Times in 2009, but is not standing ahead of Kejriwal's stature - the latter is more
 aap ke baagi binni kya sisodiya ko chunauti de paaenge?kejariwal ke sabase bharosemand saathi manish sisodiya ke khilaaf bijepi ne aap ke hi baagi netaa vinod kumaar binni ko tikat diya he
 In the last election, Binny contested from Laxmi Nagar seat and defeated the Congress leader Ashok Walia
 lekin sisodiya patpadganj se vidhayak rah chuke hai or binni yahaan ke liye bahari hai
 If Binny wins from the modi-bedi wave also, it will be a big upset

 So will BJP field Shazia against Somnath? Somnath Bharti, the most popular minister of aap's 49-day government, has been nominated by the party from Malviya Nagar
 us dauraan kejariwal ne jis tarah somnath kaa bachaav kiya, usase lagata he sitaudiya ke baad somnath unke bharosemand saathi hai
 The bjp's strategy so far has been shocking
 aise main shajia ko lekar bhi kayaas to lagaaya hi ja saktaa he

 India has changed, Congress party will have to change '
