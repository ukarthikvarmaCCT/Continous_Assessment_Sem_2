 If the Grand Alliance failed on the pitch of Uttar Pradesh's politics, then the reason behind this is the game plan that the BJP made in a very strict manner in the last one and a half years
 is jeet ke peeche kii planning lakhanu main bijepi ke mukhyalay main hui, jise bijepi kaa control room bhi kaha jaataa he
 Amit Shah became the in-charge of Uttar Pradesh and Sunil Bansal cum in-charge in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, since then the party has won two Lok Sabha and one Assembly elections

 kai siton par candidet badale gaye, jabaki kai ummidavaaron ke seat badal die gaye jisase ummidavaaron ke khilaaf naaraazgi kaa maamla lagbhag khatm ho gaya
 Sunil Bansal said that till 3 months before the election, the BJP nominated 16,000 of its workers in different committees, corporations, boards and other government organizations across the state, which ended the resentment among the workers and it excitedly Started working

 Bansal said that it was decided long ago that we should not get into the trap of politics of grand alliance of caste and religion and we have to prepare the pitch of nationalism and developmentism for the casteless fight, because if we talk about caste and equations So we could not defeat this alliance, so we had to bring the Grand Alliance on our pitch and we were successful in it
 unhone kaha ki bijepi ko yah maaloom tha ki is baar to piem modi ke naam par pro-incumbency he or yogi adityanath ke khilaaf bhi koi naaraazgi nahin, aise main mahagathbandhan ke vanshavaad or bhrashtachar par chot karne ke saath-saath rashtrawaad or sanghathan ko hathiyaar bananaa tha, jise party ne bakhubi kiya
 Sunil Bansal told in the conversation that once the ground work was ready we were ahead of the Grand Alliance in 53 seats and our fight was limited to 27 seats which was very tough and where it was very difficult to win, but Modi wave on the ground, The desire to bring Modi among the people and the zeal of the activists also made us fight in these 27 seats and we won 11 seats in it
 unhone kaha ki bijepi kii chah logon kii team roj aapas main batkar fic back detii thi

 bihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne centre sarkaar se petrol or dijal kaa base price ghataane kii apil kii he
 They believe that a decrease in base price will automatically reduce VAT and reduce prices
 nitish kumaar kaa maananaa he ki bihar main base price zyada he
 Nitish said that the base price of petrol and diesel in Bihar is higher than in Jharkhand
 jharkhand main base prise 51 rupe he jabaki bihar main 55 rupye se bhi zyada he
 Recently, Petroleum Ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Nitish Kumar also discussed this issue
 centre sarkaar ne petrol dijal kii keemten kam karne ke lierajyon se waite kamakarne ko kaha tha
 Nitish Kumar said that the entry tax charged to Barauni refinery at this base price could not be taken directly
 isi vajah se to usko vah in sab chizon ke madhyam se lete the
 After GST, all this stuff has also stopped
 nitish ne centre sarkaar se kaha ki tex kii gananaa karne se to hamaara base price bhi ghatega or ham log kaa jo charge petrol par he yaa dijal par lete hai
 VAT in Bihar is lower than most states except one or two states, only 26 percent on petrol and 19 percent on diesel
 bihar pehle se hi sabase kam waite lagane vaala rajya he
 If the base price decreases then the price of petrol and diesel will decrease here automatically
 bihar ke siem nitish kumaar ne kaha ki in sab chizon ke baavjood, sari baaten bataa dene ke baavjood ham log aapas main baithkar charchaa karenge or is baar nahin ek baar pehle bhi petrol ordijal ke daam main badi badhotareehui thi
 We reduced that in our state
 kuch samay ke liye to un sab chizon par ham log aapas main vichaar karne vaale hai, lekin hamane sarkaar se aagrah kiya he ki ek baar base price ko dekh lijie kyonki jharkhand main kaa 51 rupye he to hamaare yahaan 55 rupye kaise ho gaya

 shodh ke dauraan yah bhi paaya gaya ki pati se zyada selary paane vaali mahilaon main isaki ashanka sabase zyada hoti he
 This study has been done by researchers from the University of Illinois of America
 shodhakartaaon ke anusaar parivaar ko sabase zyada vittiya madad koun kar rahaa he or iskaa unke manovigyaan par bhi asar hota he
 The study found that as the income of women increases compared to other members of their family, symptoms of depression start to occur in them
 shodhakarta karen kraamar or sujin paak ne paaya ki duusari oraay main badhotareeke saath purushon kaa naa keval jeevanaster sudharta he, balki unki maansik sehat par bhi iskaa sakaaratmak asar hota he
 The study included 1463 men and 1769 women and examined their psychology and mental health
 adhyayan kii report main daawa kiya gaya ki jab ek mahila apane bacchon kii dekhbhaal or parivaar ke liye chuttee lekar ghar par rahane lagati he to uski maansik sehat par iskaa koi khaas nakaaratmak asar nahin dikhataa
 But on the contrary, when men stop at home to take care of the children, then their mental health is affected
 shodhakartaaon ne kaha ki adhyayan ke dauraan mahilaon or purushon main naukari or ghar kii jimmedaariyon or unki vajah se hone vaale avsaad main antar najar aayaa
 While the level of depression was found to be higher in men leaving work for the care of children or home, there was no significant impact on the mental health of women
 mohammad rafee ke gaae geet 'tum mujhe yun bhula na paaoge' ko sach main koi nahin bhul paaya he or na hi gayak ko koi bhula paaya he
 He was a veteran singer of Indian cinema, who captivated everyone with his melodious songs
 unke gaae geet aaj bhi bade chaav se sune jate hai
 Rafi has won the Filmfare Award as Best Singer six times
 vah aaj bhi karodon logon ke dilon main jinda hai
 Rafi was born on 24 December 1924 in Kotla Sultan Singh near Amritsar
 jab vah chote the, tabhi unka parivaar lahore se amritsar aa gaya tha
 Rafi's elder brother owned a barber shop
 rafee zyada samay vahiin bitaayaa karte the
 a fakir used to sing through that shop
 saat saal ke rafee unka peechha kiya karte the or fakir ke geeton ko gunagunaate rahete the
 One day the fakir heard Rafi singing
 unki sureeli aawaaj se prabhavit hokar fakir ne rafee ko bahut bada gayak banane kaa aashirwad diya, jo aage chalakar faleebhoot bhi hua
 His elder brother Mohammad Hameed advised him to get education from Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan, seeing his interest in singing
 ek baar prakhyat gayak kundan laal sahagal akashwani (ol india radio lahore) ke liye khule manch par geet gane aae, lekin bijli gul ho jane se sahagal ne gane se manaa kar diya
 To calm the anger of the people, Rafi's brother requested the organizers to sing Rafi, thus at the age of 13 Rafi performed for the first time in front of the invited audience
 mohammad rafee ne iske baad punjabi film 'gul baloch' (1944) ke liye gaaya
 He decided to go to Mumbai in 1946
 sangeetkaar naushaad ne unhen film 'pehle aap' main gane kaa mauka diya
 Rafi gained fame for the first time with the song 'tera Toy Tota' from the film 'anmol Ghadi' (1946), adorned by Naushad's music
 'shahid', 'mela', or 'dulaari' ke liye bhi rafee ke gaae geet khub mashhoor hue lekin 'baiju baavaraa' ke geeton ne rafee ko mukhyadhara ke gayakon main laakar khadaa kar diya
 Rafi sang many songs for Naushad
 shankar-jaykishan ko bhi rafee ke gane pasand aae or unhone bhi rafee ko apni layaaddh geeton ko gane kaa mauka diya
 He became the first choice of music directors like Madan Mohan, Ghulam Haider, Jayadev
 rafee ke gaae gaanon par dilip kumaar, bharat bhushan, devanand, shammi kapur, rajesh khanna, dharmendra jaise sitaron ne abhinay kiya
 Rafi received the Filmfare Award for the first time for the title song of 'chaudhvi Ka Chand' (1960)
 1961 main rafee ko doosraa filmphere puraskaar film 'sasuraal' ke geet 'teri pyaari-pyaari surat' ke liye mila
 Music composer Laxmikant made his debut in the film world with Rafi's melodious voice
 lakshmikant-pyarelal ke dhunon se saji film 'dosti' (1965) ke geet 'chaahunga main tuje sanjh savere' ke liye unhen teesraa filmphere puraskaar mila
 He was also awarded the Padma Shri award in 1965
 1966 kii film 'suraj' ke geet 'bahaaron phool barasaaon' ke liye unhen chauthaa puraskaar mila

 rafee jab 13 saal ke the, tabhi unhone pehali shaadi chachee kii beti basheeran begum se kar lee thi
 Rafi kept this thing hidden
 unhone kuch hi saal baad basheeran se taalak le liya
 He was then married to Wilkis Begum
 rafee teen beton or chaar betiyon ke pita bane
 When his daughter-in-law Yasmin Khalid Rafi mentioned the first marriage of this great singer in his book 'mohammed Rafi: Mere Abba (A Memoir)', people came to know about it
 ek baar lata mangeshkar ke saath roylty ko lekar rafee kaa vivaad ho gaya tha
 Rafi used to say that there is no question of taking royalties after singing the song, while Lata used to say that singers and singers must get a share of the income from the song
 ise lekar donon ke bich manmutav ho gaya
 The two stopped singing together
 baad main naragis ke kehane par film 'jewel thief' ke gane 'dil pukaare aa re aa re aa re' ko donon ne saath gaaya
 One day suddenly Rafi's attitude stopped
 mahaan gayak ko shaayad duniya se apane jane kaa abhas ho gaya tha
 On July 31, 1980, after recording her song, she told laxmikant-pyarelal, "now i will leave" and Sham 7
 30 baje dal kaa daura padane se ve hameshaa ke liye ham sabko chhodkar chale gaye
 When this uncrowned king of music was being handed over, Naushad began to mutter these lines - "he says someone is gone, Dilbar is gone, Sahil calls out to the sea, but no one says what is true, Monsiki's chamber went away from the world
 "tippaniyan Thousands of people had moist eyes that day
 tej barish ho rahi thim maano prakruti bhi is gayak ke jane kaa matam manaa rahi ho
 Actor Manoj Kumar had said that it seems that mother Saraswati too is saddened by her son's departure

 unhone 1946 main mumbai jane kaa faisla kiya
 Music composer Naushad gave him a chance to sing in the film 'pehle Aap'
 naushaad ke sangeet se saji film 'anmol ghadi' (1946) ke geet 'tera khilonaa tutaa' se rafee ko pehali baar prasiddhi mili
 The songs sung by Rafi for 'shaheed', 'mela', and 'dulari' were very popular, but the songs of 'baiju Bawra' made Rafi stand out among the mainstream singers
 naushaad ke liye rafee ne kai geet gaae
 shankar-jaikishan also liked Rafi's songs and also gave Rafi a chance to sing his rhythmic songs
 vah madan mohan, gulam haidar, jayadev jaise sangeet nirdeshkon kii pehali pasand ban gaye
 The songs sung by Rafi starred Dilip Kumar, Bharat Bhushan, Devanand, Shammi Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna, Dharmendra
 'chaudaavin kaa chand' (1960) ke sheershak geet ke liye rafee ko pehali baar film fere puraskaar mila

 When Rafi was 13 years old, he first married his aunt's daughter Basheran Begum

 There was a feud between the two about this
 donon ne saath gaanaa band kar diya
 Later, at the behest of Nargis, the duo sang the song 'dil Pukare Aa Re a Re a Re' from the film 'jewel Thief'

 The great singer probably had a sense of his departure from the world
 31 july, 1980 ko unhone apana gaanaa record karaane ke baad lakshmikant-pyarelal se kaha, "nau ai vil live" or shaam 7
 After leaving the party at 30 o'clock they left us all forever

 Rafi on his birthday Shat Sat Naman !!! (apart from the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from Syndicate feed

 There was a feud between the two about this
 donon ne saath gaanaa band kar diya
 Later, at the behest of Nargis, the duo sang the song 'dil Pukare Aa Re a Re a Re' from the film 'jewel Thief'
 ek din achaanak rafee kaa rukhsat ho janaa sabko rulaa gaya
 The great singer probably had a sense of his departure from the world
 31 july, 1980 ko unhone apana gaanaa record karaane ke baad lakshmikant-pyarelal se kaha, "nau ai vil live" or shaam 7
 After leaving the party at 30 o'clock they left us all forever
 jab sangeet ke is betaj badshaah ko supurde khaak kiya ja rahaa tha, to naushaad ye panktiyaan barabas hi budbudane lage- "kahata he koi dil gaya, dilbar chalaa gaya, sahil pukaarata he samandar chalaa gaya, lekin jo baat sach he kahata nahin koi, duniya se mausiki kaa payambar chalaa gaya
 "comments us din hajaaron logon kii ankhen nam thim
 It was raining heavily as if nature was also mourning the departure of this singer
 abhinayta manoj kumaar ne kaha tha ki aisa lagata he ki aaj maa saraswati bhi apane bete ke jane se dukhi hai
 Rafi is not among us today, but his songs are still humming

 ) The Modi government has been heard harshly by its ally Shiv Sena on demonetisation
 shivasena ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main kaha gaya he ki modi ne janata ke saath vishwashghat kiya he
 The Modi government has brought 1
25 billion people on the road to take out the black money from a handful of industrialists
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne500-1000 ke notonko achaanak radd karke bharat kii sava sau karod janata par aarthik araajaktaa kaa bam pehle hi daal diya he, upar se 30 disambar ke baad ve ek or joardaar dhamaakaa karne kii baat kar rahe hai
 We ask the government how black money will come out of this decision? Those who have black money do not stand in these lines with 500-1000 notes
 unka paisa videshi baikon me surakshit he or modi ke faisle se pehle hi in paison ko videsh bhej diya gaya ho to kya un logon par kya karrwai hogi
 It is said in 'saamana' that perhaps the Prime Minister is thinking of destroying the factory of terrorism including Dawood by putting a nuclear bomb on Pakistan and turning it into a credibility
 vaise bhi raksha mantri manohar parrikar ne pehle hi kah diya he ki pakistan par ham parmaanu bam daalenge
 Maybe this explosion will happen after December 30
 yani akhand bharat kaa sapana saakaar hone me ab sirf ek mahina bachaa he
 Shiv Sena said that after December 30, there will be a declaration to implement uniform civil law in the entire country or by removing Article 370 from Kashmir, a nation will dream of a mark

 jab bhi desh kisi bhayanak aapadaa kaa shikaar hota he, pradhanmantri rashtriya raahat kosh (piemenaref) main udaartaapurvak daan dene kii apil satta shikhar se hoti he
 But you will be surprised to know that the Prime Minister's Office is not as generous as the people of the country cooperate
 daan kisne diya or us paise se kisko laabh mila, pradhanmantri karyaalay yah bataanaa nahin chahta
 The reason behind this is that the PMO argues that it is a private institution which is neither accountable to the common citizens nor to the donors, nor to Parliament, the highest temple of democracy at a distance of few minutes from the PMO
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki pradhanmantri rashtriya raahat kosh main aisa kya he jise dashakon se chhipaane kii koshish ho rahi he?soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon lagu hone ke baad jab sawaal puche jane lage to piemenaref ne khud ko nijee sanstha bataakar jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya
 But the Central Information Commission has twice given landmark verdicts in the matter and termed this fund under the purview of public authority as the institution operates from the Prime Minister's Office, the power center of the country, and two senior officials assist the Prime Minister in its management
 lekin piemo ne is maamle par dilli hycourt se ste le liya jo ab bhi lambit he
 But on the basis of all the inquiries, when India Today raised questions about this fund, the maximum focus was on the PAN number, on the basis of which tax is exempted to the donors and the amount received in it is outside the purview of income tax
 sarsari taur par bhale piemenaref kii daleelein uske lihaaj se jaij hon, lekin india today ne sabase pehle yah sawaal uthaaya ki jab piemenaref khud ko nijee sanstha bataati he to uskaa pan card government shrenee se kyon jari kiya gaya he
 The fourth word of the PAN card indicates the category of the holder
 nishchit taur se iskaa koi khandan piemo ke paas nahin tha, lihaaja sarkaar ne pan number hi badal diya
 (see box for difference in PAN card) In this regard, India Today sought to provide the reason for changing the PAN card under the Right to Information Act and to provide file notings related to it, then the Relief Fund once again played hide and seek
 piemo ne apane jawaab main daleel di ki is sawaal kaa jawaab nahin diya ja saktaa kyonki yah artiai act kii dhara 2 (epa) ke daayre main nahin aata
 Now PMNRF has issued in the category of PAN Card Trust, but it is non registered trust
 aise main sawaal uthta he ki kya gaiyr panjikrut trust piemo se chal saktaa he
 In response to this question, Wajahat Habibullah, who was responsible for this relief fund during the tenure of the country's first Chief Information Commissioner and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, says to India Today, "this should be told to the PMO
" lekin maine mukhya soochna ayukta ke taur par faisla diya tha ki chunki yah sanstha piemo se chalati he or pradhanmantri uske adhyaksh hote hai, isliye use soochna kaa adhikaar kanoon ke tahat jawaab dena hoga
 "but they deny the pmo's refusal to disclose the reasons for changing the file notings and PAN card in response to the RTI question
" unka maananaa he ki bhale piemo ne pan card badalakar use trust kii shrenee main laa diya ho or vah iske kaamkaaj ko dekhne ke liye kisi sarkari afasar kii jagah nijee karmchaaree tainaat kar le, lekin chunki pradhanmantri hi is raahat kosh ke adhyaksh hote hai, isliye use janata ke prati javabdeh bananaa hoga
 RTI activist Subhash Aggarwal is calling for the need to re-constitute the Prime Minister's Relief Fund
 unka kahana he, ''piemenaref kii sanrachana hi galat he
 It was built to settle refugees from Pakistan
 tab isamen pradhanmantri ke alaava congress party ke adhyaksh, tata ke trustee aadi ko prabandhan cameti main shaamil kiya gaya tha jo aaj praasangik nahin he
 "india Today also asked the question in RTI that if PMNRF is a trust, then who should be the full trustees of its trustees
 lekin piemo ne is par taka sa jawaab diya ki is babat pradhanmantri karyaalay kii website dekh len
 But there is no mention of the trustee anywhere in its website
 artiai activist or peshey se chartered acountint ajay kumaar goyal bhi sawaal uthaate hai, ''agar yah trust he to kya pandit nehru ne aage kisi ko iskaa trustee banaaya tha
 Is there any formal record in this regard? The trust was formed with a specific purpose, but later many things were added to it
 jabaki trust kaa gathan ek khaas uddeshy ke saath hota he, lekin yahaan to ghar kii dukaan kii tarah sab kuch badal diya gaya
 "they raise a technical question that for the treatment of critical illnesses, the PMO issues assistance to the same hospitals which are on its panel
" lekin aspataalon ko jari kii jane vaali raashi main se tids nahin kaata jaataa, jabaki iskar ke niyam ke mutabik aisa hona chahie
 But in response to RTI, the PMO argues that since it does not deduct TDS, it does not need a TAN number
 yah sthiti tab he jab desh main gaiyr congressi sarkaar he or maujuuda pradhanmantri narendra modi shashan kii paardarshita par jor de rahe hai
 But his office is not making the fund accountable to the public, which runs on public money
 khud piemenaref kii website bataati he ki is saal 15 janvari tak is kosh main 2,069
 84 crores left
 nishchit taur se itani badi rakam vaale fund ko lekar lucatipi kaa khel hoga or takneekee binduon kii aad lekar javabdehi or paardarshita se bachane kii koshish hogi to sawaal uth saktaa he ki kahin andarkhaane isamen koi mahaghotaalaa to nahin pal rahaa
 There is also reason behind this fear
 is fund se garibon ko gambhir bimariyon ke liye bhi madad milti he, lekin sahaayta raashi die jane kaa koi uchit maapdand nahin he, jisase pakshpaat kii gunjaaish hameshaa bani rahati he
 However, after the Center came to power, Prime Minister Modi tried to implement the Gujarat model in the relief fund
 unhone 19 july 2014 ko samiksha baithak main is baat par jor diya ki jaruratmandon ko sahaayta dene main vyapak, vaigyanik tarika or maanavtaa ko aadhaar banaaya janaa chahie
 In this, Modi said to give priority on the basis of merit in the most serious diseases
 lekin ab bhi raahat kosh ko adhikariyon ne rahasy bana rakhaa he
 The old PAN number AAAGP0033M denotes the fourth word of the PAN as its category
 yani raahat kosh kaa pan government shrenee kaa tha, india today ne sawaal uthaaya tha
 New PAN No
 AACTP4637Q Now the Prime Minister's Office has taken PAN as a non-registered trust
 lekin file notings dene se inkaar kiya
 Can a player ever get relief by scoring a suicide goal! But in the FIFA World Cup, Brazilian defender Marcello is relieved by scoring goals for Croatia in the inaugural match

 Scientists at SK University of Agriculture Science and Technology said that if everything went according to their plans, Kashmir would soon compete with tea-producing states
 unhen ummid he ki shahatuti chaay 2 saal main bazaar main hogi
 This tea will be prepared from the extract of mulberry leaves
 vishvavidhyalay ke resham keet paalan vibhaag kii pramukh doctor rafika kamili ne kaha, ‘‘hamane vishvavidhyalay main 2007 main shahatuti chaay ke liye pareekshan shuru kiya or iske utsahjanak nattejey dekhne ko mili
 "he said," Mulberry is grown in Kashmir for silk production
 isse nikali chaay kii marketing kii ja sakati he
 Marketing will be done at the conclusion by the department next year
 ’’ kamili ne kaha ki vaigyanikon ne shahatut kii pattiyon se vibhinn chaay kii vibhinn kismein nikaali hai or isaki marketing kashmir evam rajya se baahar kii ja sakati he
 Most people in Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir want to live in India instead of Pakistan
 ek taaja janamat surveykshan main yah baat saamne ai he
 The survey also shows that the choice of public opinion poll by Islamabad will not resolve the dispute
 landan ke ek pramukh thinkatank dwaara jammu-kashmir main niyantran rekha ke donon taraf karaae gaye pehle surveykshan main sirf 43 pratishat logon ne hi apane liye aaazaad vatan kii himaayat kii jabaki pakistan ke mukaable main bharat main rahane kii ichha jaahir karne vaale logon kii bhi taadaad apekshaakrit zyada rahi
 On the question of choosing one of India or Pakistan, 21 percent people said that they would like the entire Kashmir to be included in India
 vahiin, 15 fisad logon ne kaha ki ve kashmir ko pakistan main shaamil karne ke paksh main vot daalenge
 According to a survey conducted by senior researcher Robar Bradnock at King's College London, only two per cent of people in Jammu and Kashmir expressed their desire to stay in Pakistan
 bradnock ne kaha ‘shodh ke nateezon se duniya main vyaapt is najariye ko bal mila he ki janamat sangrah kaa vikalp saamne khadey vivaad kaa hal nahin sujhata
 ' aatankwaad kaa panaahagaah pakistan antarrashtriya manch par baar-baar munh kii khaane ke baad bhi kashmir raag alaapne se baj nahin aa rahaa he
 It is now seeking to take the Kashmir dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
 pakistan ne kulbhushan jadhav maamle kii tarj par kashmir vivaad ko ICJ le jane kaa sanket diya he

 When RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav were summoned by the CBI for investigation, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi questioned that the CBI was asked to take 3 acres of land from the Kochhar brothers in exchange for the contract of two hotels in Rani and Ranchi
 What will Lalu Prasad and Tejashwi Yadav answer? If Tejashwi had the answer, he would not have lost his chair
 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne bhi to unase jawaab hi maanga tha jise ve de nahin paaen
 Sushil Modi asked whether Tejashwi Yadav would be able to tell the CBI how he became the owner of the 3-acre land in Patna on which his 750-crore 12-storey mall in Bihar was being built
 Will Tejashwi tell how he got such valuable land of Patna at the age of 24? How did they become owners of Delight Marketing Company? Why was the Delight Company's name changed to Lara (lalu-rabri) project just four days after demonetisation? Also read: - Sushil Modi: BJP ministers took a pledge not to compromise on corruption
 He asked whether Lalu Prasad would explain why the Kochhar brothers registered a 3-acre plot of 200 crore to Delight Marketing, a company of his close friend Premchandra Gupta? Why did the Gupta family hand over their family company and crores of land to the Lalu family? How did all the shares of Delight Company get transferred to the names of Rabri Devi and Tejashwi Yadav? Sushil Modi said that Tejashwi and Lalu Prasad do not have any answer to any of these questions

 Today we will tell about Narendra Modi, not BJP Prime Minister, but BJP worker and RSS volunteer
 narendra modi kaa janm 17 sitambar 1950 main gujarat ke vadnagar main hua, lekin modi ke saamaajik jivan kii shuruyaat june 1975 main hui
 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed emergency in the country and many big leaders were put in jail
 is dauraan modi ko aresas ke samarthan se chalane vaali gujarat lok sangharsh samiti kaa mahasachiv niyukt kiya gaya
 After some time RSS was also banned
 giraftaar se bachane ke liye modi underground ho gaye
 Narendra Modi came to Delhi and started making strategies to challenge the decision of the Central Government
 is dauraan unhone sarkaar ke faisle ke khilaaf parche chhapavaaye
 Emergency ended and Modi became RSS pracharak
 surat or vadodara main sangh kii shakhaon ke vistaar ke liye unhone raat din kaam kiya
 In 1979, he was called to Delhi for RSS work
 ab narendra modi sangh ke ek sakriy swanyasevak ban chuke the unhen dilli main shodh or immergency par lekh likhane kii jimmedaari di gai
 In 1985, Narendra Modi entered politics

 In 1987, Narendra Modi helped campaign in the Ahmedabad civic elections
 in chunaavon main bijepi aaraam se jeet gai
 In 1986, Lal Krishna Advani became BJP President and the RSS decided to appoint its workers to important positions in the BJP

 The BJP got an absolute majority in the 1998 assembly elections and Keshubhai Patel became the Chief Minister

 According to government figures, 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus died in these riots
 jabaki swatantra agenciyon ne in dangon main 2000 logon ke maare jane kii baat kahi
 Amid the riots, Narendra Modi had to prove himself as the state was going to have assembly elections
 modi goa main hui bijepi kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak main apane istife kii peshkash kar chuke the jise party ne sweekaar karne se inkaar kar diya tha
 Under Modi's leadership, the party contested in December 2002 and the BJP won 127 out of 182 seats

 Police have arrested two youths who killed Naveen with a knife
 police ke mutabik ve donon naveen ko jaanate bhi nahin the
 The reason for the murder was the intoxication of both the accused
 police ke mutabik beeti 1 disambar ko sarita vihaar main naveen joshi naamak ek shaks kakatlahua tha
 Who used to work in Nirman Bhavan in Sarita Vihar
 naveen ke sharir par chaaku se waar ke kareeb ek darjan nishaan the
 When the family members saw Naveen's body, no one was conscious
 kisi ko bhi vishwaas nahin ho rahaa tha ki naveen is tarah se unhen chhod kar chale gaye
 When the police started searching for Naveen's slayer, his search was completed by visiting two boys
 police kii tafteesh ke mutabik vikaas or kamran naam ke do ladakon ne naveen kii chaaku maar kar hatya kii thi
 Surprisingly, the accused Vikas and Kamran had no acquaintance or enmity with Naveen

 police ne aropiyon ke paas se naveen kaa mobile phone or debit card aadi baraamad kar liya he
 At the same time, the police recovered the cabbage used in the murder

 Initially there was no clue
 baavjood iske unhone do din ke andar hi kaatil daboch liye
 In fact, when the police started investigating the case, they came to know that at the place where the murder took place, two addicts commit robbery
 bas isi ke chalate police ne vikaas or kamran ko pakad liya
 Both of them confessed their crime when questioned
 police ne donon aropiyon ko adaalat main pesh karne ke baad jail bhej diya he

 dilli main gharon ke upar lage mobile toweron kii sankhya main teji se badhottaree hui he jinamein bahut saare niyamon ko taak par rakhkar khadey kiye gaye hai
 In a recently released report, 66 percent of mobile towers are illegal in South Delhi alone

 SDMC main vipaksh ke netaa farhaad suri kaa kahana he ki SDMC main jabardastbhrashtachar vyaapt he
 The people of SDMC are engaged in filling their pockets with money from mobile tower operators
 SDMC ko saare avaidh mobile toweron ko tatkaal hataanaa chahie

 If more number of mobile towers are installed at one place than the limit, then the radius of the radius emanating from these towers increases

 FD, Sona, Jamapunji were all given in the name of the house and they took the loan from the bank and paid all the money to the developer
 lekin phir bhi ghar kaa ye intjaar khatm hone kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 The budget of the house has succumbed to this debt
 anemation se dikhaaya world class ashiyane kaa khvabgrih pravesh kaa ehsaas jindagi ke chand khoobasarat ehsaason main se ek hota he
 It is not possible to express the joy of this moment in words
 isi ehsaas ko bhunaane kii khatir bilders ghar kaa sapana bechate hai or logon ke jajbaton se khelkar unki jeb se moti rakam anth lete hai
 The dream of a world class lover is shown by showing animation while booking a house
 khyaalon main buna hua ye kaanch kaa gharonda pojeshan kii taarikh ke najadik aate hi tuutane lagata he or jaise taise jab pajeshan mil bhi jaataa he tab us flats main grih pravesh kii khushi chand minuton main hi kafoor ho jaati he
 After years of craving for possession, Amrapali has started giving houses in sapphire and platinum, but these houses are very decaying
 nahin hui ghar kii registriclatt byrs kaa aarope he ki aanan-fanan main ghar to inhen de diya gaya lekin flats kii kamiyaan yahaan rahane waalon se chuphi nahin hai
 Fire safety equipment is definitely in place but they are not connected to the water pipeline and neither their sensors are working
 suvidhaon kii kamiyon kaa to jitna bhi zikr ho utana kam he lekin amrapali ke in projects main rahane waalon ko makaan maalik banane kaa mauka abhi tak nahin mila he
 For the registry of the house, the builder has to obtain the completion certificate ie CC from the authority and the CC authority gives it when the builder completes the work
 saaf he ki sarkari kaagajon main bhi builder kaa kaam adhuraa he
 Even after the completion of several promises proved to be false, getting CC will be nothing short of a miracle as the authority owes Rs 450 crore to different projects of Amrapali Group according to an RTI
 yani abhi tak jameen kii sari rakam tak develper ne athurity ko nahin chukaai he
 If the developer had completed all the formalities and got the possession on time, the customers would not have to pay the increased amount as stamp duty for the registry
 in mushkilon ke baad aap samaj sakate hai aakhir kaise maahaul main amrapali ke projects main log rahete hai
 Work is still going on in many towers, the lift uses labor and there is a break in moving the goods
 yahi nahin suraksha par bhi amrapali group kii haalat badtar he yahaan par chori kii vaaradaaten bhi aae din logon ko pareshaan karti hai
 Car parking is also not allotted despite charging a hefty amount of money
 dhoni ne bhi jhaada pallamrapali ke lagjri style ke saath jab dhoni kaa naam judaa to logon kaa amrapali par bharosa or bad gaya
 Mahendra Singh Dhoni's stardom was used in such a way that people vied to become Dhoni's neighbor
 phir kya tha dhoni amrapali ke brands embesder bane
 Dhoni will also have a house in Amrapali Sapphire, when this was publicized, Amrapali Sapphire got a buyers line
 dhoni kaa padosi banane kii hasarat to puri hui hi nahin ghar kaa pajeshan paanaa bhi mushkil ho gaya he
 Amrapali's customers pleaded with Dhoni to get him out of the crisis
 dhoni ne logon ko yakeen dilaayaa ki wo amrapali se is bare main baat karenge
 But even before talking, he left Amrapali and left Byers in the middle
 group de rahaa he juthi dalilenis masale par amrapali group ke chairmen ne kai kamiyon ko sweekaar kiya unhone ye daleel bhi di ki in flats kaa kaam kai baar rukaa
 Sometimes because of the performance of the farmers, sometimes because of the direction of the National Green Tribunal
 haalanki ek sachai ye bhi he ki neshnal green tibunel ne kabhi bhi kaam rokane kaa nirdesh nahin diya tha

 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main hue aatanki hamale ko lekar desh bhar main shok kaa maahaul he
 In this way, Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati of Dwarka Shardapith has postponed the program of Ram Janmabhoomi Ramagraha Yatra and Shilanyas
 kumbh nagari prayagraj main hue param dharm sansad main shankaracharya ne aagaamee 21 farvari ko ayodhya main ram mandir nirmaan ke shilanyas karne kaa elaan kiya tha
 For which all the sages and saints were called to reach Ayodhya as part of the Ramagraha Yatra and on Sunday, Shankaracharya himself was to join this yatra
 shankaracharya swami swaroopanand saraswati pichley kuch dinon se biimaar chal rahe the or banaras hindu uniwarsity ke sar sunderlaal aspataal main bhartee the
 During this time he was also being advised to postpone the trip due to poor health, but he was not ready
 lekin aspataal se kaashi ke shrividyamath laute shankaracharya ko jab pulavama main hui aatanki ghatana or desh kii paristhitiyon se avgat karaayaa gaya or is sambandh main akhaada parishad or mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne anurodh kiya, tab unhone kaha ham desh ke saath hai
 His disciple Swami Avimukteshwarananda, who represented Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopananda in connection with the yatra, said that the decision taken in the context of Ram Janmabhoomi is timely and necessary
 lekin desh main utpann hui is aakasmik paristhiti main yah yatra kuch samay tak ke liye sthagit karne kaa nirnay liya gaya he
 He said that the Ramagraha Yatra and foundation stone program is also necessary because the Central Government has requested the Supreme Court to give the non-disputed acquired land in Ayodhya to its owners
 lekin adaalat ne centre kii arji ko mul vaad se jod diya he
 This move of the Supreme Court raises the danger of the land being removed from the hands of Hindus
 unhone kaha ki iske alaava sarkaar dwaara bhagwaan ram kii pratimaa sthapit karne kii jo yojana banaai gai he vah bhi shaastra sammat or sanathan dharmiyon kii bhaavana ke vipareet he
 Swami Avimukteshwarananda said that despite all this, today the terrorist activities of Kashmir has created a war-like atmosphere in the country
 aatankwaad se peedit hamaare sainikon ke parivaar atyant vyathit hai
 Hence, the Ramagraha Yatra and the foundation stone program can divert the attention of the entire nation
 isliye shankaracharya aisa nahin chahenge ki unka koi bhi kaarykram rashtrahit main vyavdhaan daale
 Therefore, the program will be completed in the future by taking out a new Muhurta to suit this journey
 iske saath hi shankaracharya ne santon or rambhakton se apil kii he ki jo is abhiyaan ke liye apane gharon se nikal chuke he or prayag yaa anya jagahon par pahunch chuke hai wo sangam snaan karke apane ghar waapas chale jaaen

 '' congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne buudhvaar ko mandsaur raily main bhartiya janata party or modi sarkaar par jamkar hamalaa bolaa or aarope lagaae
 Late in the evening, veteran BJP leader Arun Jaitley responded to every single allegation of Rahul Gandhi through Facebook and called him baseless
 bataa den ki arun jetali haal hi main aspataal se waapas ghar laute hai
 Arun Jaitley on Wednesday accused Rahul Gandhi of making a 'completely wrong' remark at a rally in Madhya Pradesh and said that not a single rupee of any industrialist's debt has been forgiven
 arun jetali ne kuch is tarah ek-ek aarope kaa jawaab diya
 1
 rahul kaa aarope -modi sarkaar ne 15 udyogpatiyon ke 2
 Rs
5 lakh crore loan waived
 jetali kaa jawaab -congress adhyaksh kii yah baat tathyaatmak rup se puri tarah galat he
 The Modi government has not waived even a rupee loan of industrialists
 jin logon ke upar bainkon or anya vittiya sansthaanon kaa bakaayaa he, unhen diwalia ghoshit kiya gaya or unhen ibisi ke jariye unki company se bedakhal kiya gaya he
 This law was implemented by the Modi government
 inamen jyadatar karj upie shashan ke dauraan die gaye
 2
 rahul kaa aarope -abhi sab maid in china, ham banaaenge maid in mandsaurajetli kaa jawaab -jab upie kii sarkaar thi to desh main mobile banane kii sirf 2 companiyaan thim, or aaj 120 se zyada companiyaan hai
 3
 rahul kaa aarope -piem modi ne do hira kaarobaariyon ko 35-35 hajaar karod rupee die, jo ab desh chhodkar chale gaye
 Jaitley's answer - This is factually incorrect
 bank dhokhadhadi saal 2011 main shuru hui
 The UPA was ruled at that time
 is dhokhadhadi kaa pataa endie sarkaar ke aane ke baad laga
 'how much does Rahul know, when will he know'? In an article titled 'how much do he know' on the party's website, Jetley questioned whether Gandhi was being given insufficient information, or that he was too lenient with his facts
 
 jetali ne kaha, "jab bhi main rahul gandhi ke vichaar sunata hum, chaahe vah sansad ke andar hon yaa baahar
 i ask myself this again and again - how much does he know? When will he know? After listening to his speech given in Madhya Pradesh, there was a curiosity to know the answer to this question once again
 "jetali ne kaha, "sarkaar ne kisi udyogpati kaa ek rupaya bhi bakaayaa maaf nahin kiya he
 Those who have not repaid the debt are being declared insolvent and have been removed from their companies through the IBC (insolvency and Bankruptcy Code), implemented by Prime Minister Modi's government
 " Delhi Police has revealed the secret of Sunanda Pushkar's death

 This was revealed after receiving the final report from AIIMS
 jehar koun sa tha, ye abhi saafe nahin he
 But in 2014, Sudhir Gupta expressed the possibility of poisoning like polonium 210
 epabiai ne apni report main ames kii postmortem report par muhar lagaai he
 This report was published in 2014 by Dr
 sudhir gupta ne di thi
 The FBI also said in its investigative report that Sunanda died of poisoning
 ames ke medical board ne sunanda pushkar kii maut par apni final report dilli police ko saunp di he
 Earlier, the board made an in-depth overview of the fbi's forensic report
 epabiai ne kii thi visra kii jaanchasunanda pushkaraki hatya ke baad unka visra jaanch ke liye america kii agency epabiai ko bheja gaya tha
 The FBI submitted the investigation report of Visra to the Delhi Police after nine months
 lekinefabiaiki report par ames ko apni raay dene ke liye kaha gaya tha
 AIIMS had created a board a board of doctors was constituted in AIIMS for this work
 board ko epabiai kii forensik report kaa avlokan kar final report deni thi
 On Friday, the report was submitted to the Delhi Police on behalf of AIIMS
 yah is maamle kii final report he
 Tharoor may be interrogated
 s constituted to investigate the matter
 ai
 T
 ke sutron kaa maananaa he ki jald hi is maamle main sunanda pushkar ke pati congress netaa shashi tharur se poochtacha kii ja sakati he
 Top sources associated with the case of Khulna Sunanda's death say that this report has great importance
 yadi ames kii yah report nirnaayak he, to yah is hatyakand ke nishkarsh tak pahunchane main madad karegi
 Actually, some things were not available before in this case
 jisaki vajah se yah jaanch baadhit ho rahi thi
 lashkar-e-taiba has created a deadly conspiracy
 khufia agenciyon kii maane to andaman or nicobar dweep par lashkar aatank ke training camp kholane kii taiyaari main he
 If considered straightforward, then Lashkar has fully prepared to enter the borders of India
 grih mantralay bhi lashkar ke is napak mansoobey ko halke main nahin lenaa chahta
 The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an alert in Andaman and Nicobar
 dehshatgardi kii duniya main aatank kaa doosraa naam he lashkar-e-taiyaba
 Lashkar terrorists can do anything to carry out any dreadful terrorist incident
 hindustan main abhi tak jitne aatanki hamale hue hai, zyaadaatar hamalo se lashkar kaa hi naam judaa he
 And now Lashkar is preparing to execute another deadly plot
 lashkar-e-taiyaba ke sargana bharat ko dehshat kii nazaron se ghur rahe hai
 There is news that the terrorist organization Lashkar is planning to build its stronghold on Andaman and Nicobar islands
 kaha ja rahaa he ki lashkar andaman or nicobar ko aatank kii zamin ke taur par istemaal karnaa chahta he
 According to intelligence sources, the terrorists want to take this very beautiful island which is within the limits of India
 itnaa hi nahin lashkar kii buree nazar maldive par bhi he
 The home ministry has also reported the nefarious plans of terrorists
 grih mantralay ne vahaan ke prashasan ko alert kaa rahane kaa nirdesh jari kar diya he
 The Home Ministry has given strict instructions to the administration to issue the identity card of every citizen of Andaman and Nicobar
 saath hi grih mantralay kii taraf se is kii miyaad bhi rakh di gai he
 Obviously the risk is huge and from security agencies to the government, it does not want to take it lightly
 kyonki lashkar kii rag rag se duniya waakif he
 The story of his terror is so dreadful that no one is mentioned in it except destruction
 mumbai hamale ke baad sunne main aayaa tha ki pakistan ne muzaffarabad main lashkar ke training campon par karrwai kii thi
 It was also the report of intelligence agencies that ISI has set up Lashkar camps in Bangladesh and there is ongoing terror training
 lekin in khabaron ke baad sarkaar or suraksha agenciyon kii neend ud gai he ki lashkar kii nazar andaman, nicobar or maldive par bhi he
 Terrorist organizations are looking for a new base, a base that is safe and away from the public eye
 andaman nicobar isiilie unke nishane par he
 There are more advantages to building terror bases in Andaman
 adenman auki nicobar dweep samuh main chote bade kul 572 dweep hai jinamein se sirf 38 dweep hi aise hai jis par log rahete hai
 The rest of the 534 islands are completely uninhabited and the distance between many of these islands is also very high and what can be more favorable for the terrorists
 jaahir he agar aatankwaadi kisi tareeke se andaman nicobar ke in nirjan dwipon par ghuspaith karne main kaamyaab ho jate hai to phir vahaan unke liye apane aatank ke adde taiyaar karnaa aasaan hoga
 Most of the islands of Andaman and Nicobar islands are surrounded by extremely dense forests and it will not be difficult for the terrorists to hide here
 mumbai hamale ke liye jis tarah lashkar ne samudri raste kaa istemaal kiya usase itnaa to sabit ho gaya he ki aatankwaadi sanghathanon ke liye ab samandar aisi jagah nahin rahi jo unki pahunch se baahar he
 They have also learned to use sea routes secretly and it is not a big challenge for them to infiltrate the uninhabited islands of Andaman and Nicobar
 phir pakistan auki afghanistan main maujuud zyaadaatar aatanki training camp america kii najar main aa chuke hai auki dehshatgard sanghathanon par nayaa thikaana talashne kaa dabaav badhata ja rahaa he
 Obviously, the terrorists are looking for a place where they can not only escape from the eyes of the security agencies, but no one can suspect them of being there
 andaman nicobar dweep samuh unki is napak sajeesh main bilkul feet baithta he
 Not only this, the islands of Andaman and Nicobar are also very important for the security of India and the terrorists' plot may also be to target important defense bases on these islands
 jaahir he aatankwaadiyon kii badalati ranneeti ko naakaam karne ke liye bhartiya suraksha agenciyon ko kaaphi chaukas rahane kii jarurat he

 According to Uddhav Thackeray, the Shiv Sena wants the country to take a decision on the Ram temple as soon as possible

 The sensor has given the film a u / a certificate with five modifications
 is certificate vaali filmein naaballig bacchon ko akele dekhne kii anumati nahin he
 This will be the first Hindi film in the country to release in IMAX 3D Hindi
 film kaa naam:brosdiarector:karan malhotraster cast:akshay kumaar , siddharth malhotra, jacleen furnandis , jaiki shrotvadhi:158 minutesrtificate:u / aretimga:2 stardiarector karan malhotra jinhone 'jodha akbar' or 'maay nem ij khan' main assistant diarector ke rup main kaam kiya tha or apni pehali film 'agnipath' rimek banaai thi jise darshakon ne kaaphi saraahaa tha
 Now Karan Malhotra is coming with another official remake, the official Hindi remake of the famous Hollywood film Warrior, 'brothers'
 bhai-bhai ke bich kii ladaai par naa jane kitni sari filmein pehle bhi banaai ja chuki hai or vaise to karan ne apni pehali film se hi apana hunar jag jaahir kar diya he lekin kya unka magic is baar bhi darshakon ko bhaayegaa? aaiye film kii samiksha karte hai
 Kahaani: This is the story of two brothers David Fernandes (akshay Kumar) and Monty Fernandes (siddharth Malhotra) of a Mumbai family
 bachapan main kinhi kaarnon se maamariya (shefali shah) kaa saaya unke sar se uth jaataa he or pita gairi furnandis (jaiki shroff) ko jail janaa padataa he
 The two brothers are brought up differently and by the time Father Gary comes out of prison, David is married to Jenny (jacqueline Fernandes) and sets up their home, and Monty lives separately
 gairi pehle se hi ek resler rahata he or bachapan se hi david ko restling kii shiksha detaa rahata he
 Then there is a Mix Martial Arts (MMA) competition in Mumbai and both brothers come face to face in the ring and then you have to watch the film to know what happens
 script, abhinay, sangitoficial rimek hone ke naate film kii script angreji film 'warrior' se hi milti julati he, lekin bhartiya roopantaran main imoshan ko bhar bhar ke daalane kii purna koshish kii gai he jo kii naakaamayaab he
 There is an attempt to show the emotions in the film, but those emotions come so often that till then you start getting bored
 pehla half kaaphi dhimaa he, or film kaa interval ke baad kaa hissaa zyada tej he
 But till the climax, you guess everything
 kabhi kabhi actors bhavuk hone kii acting karte hai lekin aap us imoshan main itane bor ho chuke rahete hai kii aapako hasi aa jaati he
 This work of Karan Malhotra seems very weak
 majaburiyon or bhavukta kaa pulinda parosane kii koshish to kii gai he lekin vah nyaaysangat nahin ho paaya he
 By the way, if the film's satellites have already been sold, then they will definitely earn money, but the honor that the film should get will remain untouched by it
 acting ke maamle main bade bhai ke kirdaar main akshay kumaar ne behtareen kaam kiya he or ek pita ke role ko jaiki shroff ne umdaa nibhaayaa he
 Every single feeling of Jackie Shroff makes you convinced of his acting
 vahiin shefali shah ne maa ke rup main or ashutosh rana kii bhi'pasha'ke role main acting kaabil e tarif he
 In the film, Siddharth Malhotra has stepped out of his comfort zone and tried to do a slightly different role, which is commendable
 apane-apane kirdaar ke liye siddharth malhotra or akshay kumaar kii taiyaari screen par dikhaai padati he
 Had the script been a bit stronger, the film would have been even more interesting
 jacleen furnandis ke liye film main kuch zyada karne ko nahin tha lekin unki adaakaari thik thaak si hi lagati he
 The music of the film is fine, because the song 'sapna Jahan' sung by Sonu Nigam reflects Akshay's marriage and daughter but there was no need for Kareena Kapoor Khan's song 'mary', as soon as this song came The pace of the film stops
 kyon dekhegar aadakshay kumaar, siddharth malhotraya jacleen or jaiki shroff ke fain hai, tabhi yah film dekhen
 Why not see if you understand the feelings, family love, then you will feel very weak
 or behatar he iske tivi par aane tak kaa intjaar kar sakate hai

 Even after the all-round protest, the RBI has withdrawn the new rules for depositing more than 5000 rupees, but people have become confused
 bainkon ke baahar lage logon main is baat ko lekar asamanjas dikhaa ki koun se niyamon ko sahi mana jaae
 The rules from depositing and withdrawing money in banks were issued by RBI soon after demonetisation
 iske baad sarkaar ne bhi logon ko sahuuliyat dene or cash flo ke banaae rakhane ke liye tamaam niyam banaae
 But in the last 42 days, these rules were changed not once but twice

 It was natural to worry if the new rule came
 lekin ab acha he ki sarkaar ne faisla waapas le liya he
 According to Madanakumar, the new rule has increased the bank's confusion

 Now the government may have withdrawn the decision, but the questions of the bankers are still being answered

 kabhi sibiai ko peeche laga do, kabhi indian mujahidin ko khuli chhot de do
 Modi mentioned the IM keeping in mind the serial blasts during his Patna rally on 27 October in which seven people were killed and several injured

 So open your ears and hear that we are born of other soil, we are not going to bow down to terrorists

 The Monsoon Session of Parliament starts next week on 18 July
 sabase bada sawaal is satr ko lekar yahi uth rahaa he ki kya isamen modi sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav laayaa ja saktaa he? pichley bajet satr main vibhinn vipakshi dalon kii ore se kai baar avishvaas prastaav kaa notice diya gaya lekin ek baar bhi yah prastaav sadan main rakhaa nahin ja sakaa
 In this session, if the ruckus and opposition parties show solidarity, then a motion of no-confidence can be debated and voted on
 tidipi or congress is baat ke sanket de chuki hai ki vah is prastaav ko satr ke dauraan sadan main laa sakati hai
 Angered by the denial of special state status to Andhra Pradesh, the TDP and YSR Congress tried to bring this proposal several times in the budget session
 iske alaava congress, tiares, ensipi samet kai vipakshi dal beete satr main avishvaas prastaav laane kii vifal koshish kar chuke hai

 Singhvi said that how the government will be surrounded, it cannot be said now, but we are ready to shore up the government on many issues related to public interest
 singhvi ne kaha ki jammu kashmir, kamjor arthvyavastha, berogari, kisaan, bhrashtachar se jude kai mudde hai jinpar sarkaar ko sansad main jawaab dena hoga
 So the government should be prepared for a motion of no confidence on all these issues, but it will be a collective decision
 prastaav laane kii prakriyasadan main jo bhi dal avishvaas prastaav laana chahta he pehle use spikar ko isaki likhit soochna deni hoti he
 The speaker then asks an MP of that party to present it
 lekin yah tabhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he jab prastaav ko kam se kam 50 saansadon kaa samarthan hasil ho
 This can be discussed in the House and then voting can be done or the mps supporting them can be counted
 aamtaur par yah prastaav sarkaar ko giraane ke makasad se laayaa jaataa he jab koi sarkaar alpamat main aa jaati he
 But it is also being used to surround and warn governments
 beete dinon main kai prastaav aise bhi aae jab sarkaar ke paas paryaapt aankade the or use koi khatra nahin tha
 It is also evident from the current figures of the Modi government that it is not threatened by this proposal

 The General, who took over as Army Chief in May 2012, stated that the Pakistani incursion was preplanned
 unhone pakistan par aarope lagaaya ki vah na sirf niyantran rekha, balki sangharshaviram kaa bhi ulanghan kar rahaa he
 • Is it part of any big conspiracy in Pakistan to behead two Indian soldiers? It was a deliberate and premeditated move
 6 janvari ko unhone aarope lagaaya ki 5 janvari kii raat unke yahaan ghuspaith kii gai, jo saraasar jhooth tha or phir unhone sainya sanchaalan mahanideshkon (dijiemo) kii mulaakaat karaane kii baat kii
 Which we agreed to
 uske baad 7 janvari ko unhone hamaare rajanyik ko shikaayat patr jari kiya or 8 janvari ko unhone is kaam ko anjaam de diya
 In order to do this kind of work, one has to plan in advance

 The encroachment of the Line of Control and taking our soldiers with their heads beheaded and mutilating their bodies was very wrong which needed to be raised to the right level
 hamen pakistan ko bataanaa tha ki ye sab yuddh or sena kii aachaar samhita ke viruddh he or aap aisa kaam karke batch nahin sakate
 • Pakistan must have guessed what the reaction will be? Do you think the infiltration was done intentionally? He is trying to incite violence around the Line of Control
 ulanghan kii zyaadaatar ghatnaayen udi or mendhar ke aam ghuspaith vaale ilaake main hoti rahi hai
 They violate the ceasefire by increasing infiltration activities in these areas
 •aise aarope lagaae ja rahe hai ki bhartiya sena ne pakistaniyon ke saath aisa hi kaam kiya he
 No, we didn't do anything like this
 ham geneva samjhaute kaa sammaan karte hai

 • How is it possible for you to react and hope that the situation will not deteriorate? i have commanded troops, battalions and military corps along the Line of Control
 is tarah kii baaten niyantran rekha par hoti rahati hai, par chintaa kaa vishay he sir kaatane jaisi ghatana or niyantran rekha ko paar karnaa
 If you shoot at us, we will also shoot back
 ham ise sambhaal lenge
 This is normal action

 • How do you expect Pakistan to respond in case of beheading? There is international law in this regard and it should be addressed at appropriate political and diplomatic levels
 pakistani fouj ko javabdeh bananaa hoga
 • How will you be satisfied? Family feelings should definitely be respected
 ham sainik kaa sir waapas chaahate hai
 Pakistan has been told again that without any condition we need our soldier's head back
 •astr-shastr ikattha karne main ho rahi deree ke maddenjar ham kitne taiyaar hai?hamaare paas sab kuch he
 The army has sufficient resources
 kuch khaas ghatakon yaa gola-barood kii kami kaa yuddh ke dauraan asar padataa he, par yah sthiti sirf bhartiya sena kii nahin he, balki sabhi senaaon ke saath hoti he
 There is no army on this earth that has 100 percent equipment

 i have ensured that transparency is met in meeting the needs of the general staff (in terms of quality care in the procurement of equipment)
 maine is par bhi khaas dhyaan diya he ki astr-shastr kharidte samay unka pareekshan sahi tareeke se ho or unhen vakt par uplabdh karaayaa jaae
 • Is the Pakistan Army no longer confident of the Siachen issue? This is our area
 kootnithik taur par bhi yah behad ahm he or ham is par apana adhikaar banaae rakhenge
 If we evacuate Siachen, then what is the confidence of Pakistan that it will not capture it? They had signed a ceasefire agreement with us, but they have been continuously violating it
 aap un par kaise bharosa kar sakate hai? unhone hamaare sainik kaa sir kaat daalaa or us sir ko apane saath le gaye
 • What legacy would you like to hand over to the army? i want to leave behind an army that is strong, effective and will work in accordance with national aspirations
 meraa sapana he ki bhartiya sena kii sanchaalan kshamta ko or majboot banaaya jaae jisase yah kisi bhi ladaai ke liye hameshaa taiyaar rahe
 • What would you like to say about the negative image of the army in the media recently? i am happy that the media presented negative reports about us, because it helps us to better ourselves
 lekin kuch sakaaratmak tasviren bhi pesh karen
 Please tell about my soldiers

 View this post on instagramthe joy of eating desi - Every region has its own tradition of celebrating its seasonal produce using timeless, heritage recipes
 And i strongly believe that one should follow a diet that respects that versus that which makes you feel like you have “cheated” if you eat a seasonal delicacy
 Changing the roti, sabzi and the accompaniments as the season changes, is something that we must cherish
 Nutrition societies across the globe are trying to adopt this practice from ancient cultures
 And on our part, we must ensure that this timeless practice is not forgotten and lost in the process of eating only meat or only soup-salad or not eating at all
 Health is not a size, it’s a state
 a state of harmony, in the mind and body and between people and planet
 And really, all you need to do for that is to keep calm and eat makhan-roti-saag

 The new MLA, who is seeking a Twistam strong ministry in the politics of Karnataka, will arrive after the meeting
 jeetne vaale vidhayakon ko yediurppa mantri banane kaa ofer de chuke hai, lekin unhen ye raas nahin aa rahaa he
 Legislators have something else in mind
 wo sirf mantripad se khush nahin hai, unhen majboot mantralayon kii bhi chahat he
 The results of the Karnataka Assembly by-election held on 5 December came on 9 December and the BJP won 12 of the 15 seats
 in siton par jeetne vaale netaa wo hai, jo congress yaa jedies se baagi hokar bijepi ke paale main aae the
 Seven mlas were needed to continue Yeddyurappa's government, so these results strengthened the Yeddyurappa-led BJP government
 yahi vajah rahi ki rigelt aate hi yediurppa ne jeetne vaale vidhayakon ko mantri banane kaa elaan kar diya
 Only after the results came out, Yeddyurappa said that 11 of the 12 mlas who won would be made cabinet ministers
 haalanki, navnirvaachit vidhayak yediurppa ke is ofer se khush najar nahin aa rahe hai
 According to sources, the mlas are demanding that they be given Manjwut Ministries like Home, PWD, Irrigation and Energy
 kyon maang rahe hai majboot mantralay?navnirvaachit vidhayakon ne apni is demand ke peeche kaaran bhi bataaya he
 According to sources, these mlas believe that the Yeddyurappa government is running on their own, so they should be given strong ministries
 itnaa hi nahin, jo teen netaa chunaav haar gaye hai unki bhi andekhi nahin karne kii demand vidhayakon kii taraf se kii ja rahi he
 Explain that in the by-elections MTB Nagraj, Vishwanath and Roshan Baig were defeated
 dilli pahunchenge yediurppasiem yediurppa or navnirvaachit vidhayakon ke bich aaj bengalooru main ahm meeting hai
 It is being told that after this Yeddyurappa will reach Delhi on Thursday and discuss the demand of the mlas with the high command
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki vidhayak apni demand se digne ko raji nahin he, aise main sthai sarkaar chalaane ke liye yediurppa ke saamne ek baar phir badi chunauti khadi ho gai he
 Let me tell you that elections were held in Karnataka in May 2018 and BJP won the most seats, but it could not get majority
 iske baad congress ne jedies ko samarthan dekar sarkaar bana lee thi or echdi kumaraswami mukhyamantri bane the
 However, this government was not able to run much and 17 congress-jds mlas were rebel, 16 of whom were in the bjp's fold, causing the Kumaraswamy government to fall and Yeddyurappa to become CM
 haalanki, in baagi vidhayakon kii sadsyta radd kar di gai thi, lekin supreme court ne unhen upachunaav ladane kii anumati de di thi
 At the moment, the matter is stuck on the sharing of ministries
 aise main ab yediurppa navnirvaachit vidhayakon kii demand puri karne ke liye kya rasta apanaate hai, yah dekhnaa dilachasp hoga

 purv jaj markandeya katju (markandey Katju) ne kaha ki loktantr main janata sabase upar he, phir wo chaahe piem hon yaa siem
 Markandey Katju tweeted, "the public is above all authority in any democracy, be it the President, Prime Minister, Chief Minister, Judge, MLA, Bureaucrat, Police, Army or anyone else
" ye sabhi janata ke naukar hai''
 Markandey Katju further wrote, "since the public is the master and the judge is his servant, the public can criticize the judges in the same way as the master has the right to criticize his servant"
 In a democracy the people are supreme and all authorities, whether President or the Prime Minister, Chief Minister, other ministers, judges, legislators, bureaucrats, police, army and so on are nothing but servants of the people

 '' katju ne aage ek or twit kar kaha, ''kya koi mujhe bataa saktaa he ki supreme court ne mediation karne kaa aadesh diya he yaa phir meditation yaa medication? main samaj nahin paa rahaa hum''since the people are the masters and judges their servants, the people have a right to criticise judges just as a master has the right to criticise his servant

 It is rarely seen that people who have bad relationships with partners have achieved success
 starop shuru karne se pehle karen ye kaam, milegi safaltaane kaam kii vajah talashte hanzyaadaatar safal vyakti kisi bhi kaam ko karne ke liye us kaam kii vajah talashte hai
 Before working, he thinks why he is doing this work
 workaplace par kam dostygar safal hona he, to apane kaam se matlab rakhana hoga
 Successful people say they make fewer friends at the workplace
 taaki kaam par sahi tarah se focus ho sake
 He never lets friends in between
 naukari ke saath-saath shuru karen ye bijness, jald hone lagegi kamaihameshaa nayaa karne kii chahjivan main kuch karnaa he, to hameshaa kuch nayaa karne kii chaah rakhni chahie
 Successful people believe that they always want to learn something new in life and are not afraid to take risk
 saath hi offis main idia dene se peeche nahin hatate
 Most of them said that their idea is useful or not
 ek baar dimag main aane ke baad wo use duusare logon se jarur share karte hai
 To become a successful businessman, you have to give up these habits, do not take the most advice; if you consult everyone for any work, you may get confused
 safal vyaktiyon kaa kahana he ki vah apane kisi topic par sabaki salaah na lete hai or na hi sunate hai
 At the same time, they only take advice from their trusted people, but they do what they feel is right
 himachal pradesh main bukamp kaa ek joardaar jhatka kabhi bhi lakhon logon kii jaan ke liye musiibat ban saktaa he
 This shocking revelation has been revealed in a meeting between Himachal Pradesh Sircar and the National Disaster Management Authority, according to which a single stroke of severe earthquake in Shimla, Sundernagar and Dharamshala zones of Himachal Pradesh will be enough for the devastation
 iske alaava himachal main teji se pighalane vaale glaciaron se banane vaali jhilein bhi aane vaale samay main khatre kii dastak abhi se hi dene lagi hai
 The National Disaster Management Authority has predicted an earthquake in Himachal
 himachal pradesh pahari rajya he or yahaan ke kai ilaake sinking jone main aate hai
 Therefore, earthquakes can pose a major threat to people's lives here
 iske baad rajya sarkaar ne bukamp kii sambhaavna ko dekhte hue abhi se hi logon ko aagaah karnaa shuru kar diya he
 If there is an earthquake in a place like Shimla, then many lives can be lost here due to randomly constructed buildings that cannot bear the earthquake
 shimla main kareeb teen lakh kii aabaadi he
 Chief Secretary of Himachal Pradesh Sudripto Rai says that the government is ready to deal with the situation on its behalf, but it will be very important for the public to remain vigilant in this regard
 mukhya sachiv ne kaha ki neshnal dizaster management athurity ke saath hui baithak ke dauraan ye baat bhi saamne ai kii 1905 main bukamp ne akele kangra jila main hi kareeb 2 xxrep 4 0 logon kii jaan le lee thi, vahin har sau saal main ek bahut bada bukamp aane kii sambhaavna se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 He said that the National Disaster Management Authority has done a simulation, showing the Sunder Nagar Epicenter that if an earthquake strikes and there is an earthquake for less than a minute, then the death of one lakh people is strictly and the government is alert about it
 
 logo ko bhi aagaah kar rahi he, mukhya sachiv ne bhi mana kii shimla or anya shaharon main bhawan betaratib tareeke se banaaye gaye hai or agar bukamp aata he to kaaphi nuksaan bhi ho saktaa he
 In the meeting between the National Disaster Management Authority and the Himachal government, many lakes formed due to rapidly melting glaciers can also become a major threat in the coming times
 ye jhilein bhi is parvatiy rajya ke un ilaakon main baari tabaahi kaa kaaran ban sakati hai pehle se hi jahaan nadiyaan or naale maujuud hai
 After this meeting, the state government is now considering to toughen the law for building works in more populated areas
 mukhya sachiv sudripto raay kaa kahana he kii pichley 50 saalon main shimla main badi sankhya main aise bhawanon kaa nirmaan hua he jo bukamp kii drushti se behad khatarnaak hai
 Such buildings have been declared safe by the government
 sudripto raay kaa kahana he ki shimla ke di kanjashan par ab sarkaar nai yojanaayen taiyaar kar rahi he taaki bukamp ke samay us samay kii sthiti se nipta ja sake
 There is a possibility of a massive earthquake in Himachal after 100 years
 1905 main aaye bukamp ne sirf kangra main hi kareeb 2 xxrep 4 0 logon kii jaan le lee thi
 The National Disaster Management Authority has predicted the worst of earthquakes in Shimla, Sundernagar and Dharamsala at any given time
 neshnal dizaster management athurity ne pighalate glaciaron se bani jhiilon ke liye bhi sarkaar ko aagaah kiya he
 Lakes formed by melting glaciers can also pose a major threat
 jab duniya kaa har patrkaar or tippaneekar paris main hue katleam par apana paala tay kar rahaa ho, aise main yah stambh is birdaraana eka se duuri nahin bananaa chahega
 One thing is certain that for some time, the arrival of such journalists on the target of terrorists has become a trend
 dur kyon janaa, pados ke pakistan main hi wal street jarnal ke danniel parl kaa kaise sir kalam kar diya gaya tha jabaki unka hatyara faansee kii sajaa milane ke baavjood jail se hi aisi or vaardaat ko anjaam dene kii sajeesh mobile se rach rahaa he
 The first major attack on journalism in India was seen in Punjab in the eighties when the people of Bhindranwale killed not only a few selected newspaper editors, owners and reporters but also hawkers and vendors
 sabase badi hatya hindi dainik punjab kesari ke maalik or sampadak lala jagat narayan kii hui thi or unke baad akhbaar sanbhaalane vaale unke bete ramesh chander ko bhi maar diya gaya tha
 The current editor of the newspaper Ashwini Kumar Chopra (minna) is a BJP MP from Karnal who still lives under the shadow of heavy security
 islamic jagat ko haalanki kuch zyada hi jawaab dena hoga
 The old arguments now do not convince anyone that such terrorists commit a handful of terrorists, so the entire community cannot be blamed or it is forbidden to kill innocent people in Islam
 adhiktar log ise bahut lachar tark maanate hai
 This is no longer effective because such a series of incidents, one after the other, have proved that the condemnation from the 'soft' Islamic world and its representatives from the important countries and their leaders has rarely been uncalled for
 unki ore se hameshaa hi 'buniyadi kaarnon’ par pratyaashit kism kii baat hoti he or aatank ke khilaaf puri duniya ke ek ho jane jaise maasoom bayaan sunne main aate hai
 This attitude of his is more evident when there is a person who is a victim of terror who has allegedly hurt faith
 paris hatyakand ke turant baad bhi yahi najaara dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 The rest of the world is equally angry against it, while the leaders of the most powerful Islamic countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and UAE have reacted even if they are very cautious
 dhyaan den ki inamen se kai deshon main khud aise barbar ish-ninda kanoon maujuud hai jinke tahat vaise bhi paris ke cartooniston ko faansee par chadha diya jaataa
 Iran's fatwa against Salman Rushdie has rarely been questioned by Islamic leaders and scholars, and this is the case when hardly any of them have read those alleged derogatory chapters or (like me) recommend understanding magical realism
 Keep it
 america main 9 / 11 ke hamale par aapako ''pashchim dwaara musalamaanon ko pratadit kiye jane kaa bodh” jaise tark mil sakate hai
 For 26 / 11 and similar incidents in India, starting from Kashmir till Gujarat 2002 can be counted as many excuses
 aap ekaadh din bas intjaar kariye or sharli abdo par bhi aisi hi daleelein sunne main aaengi
 The question arises, did he really commit excesses in the cartoons? Whether he was intent on condemning or not, but did he deliberately push himself to the ultimate frontier of freedom and chivalry by doing acts that hurt a great religion? Was there any need? Obviously, there will always be a question associated with all such questions that "terror is as bad as it is," "no one has the right to take anyone's life," etc
 main bahut soch-vichaar kar kah rahaa hum ki islamic jagat main to koi bhi aapako aisa nahin milane vaala jo in patrakaron ke liye 'bekasoor’ shabd kaa istemaal kar sake
 Whatever seems inherently logical in view of the above facts and history, it is also easy to do the same — that is, to be part of the outrage around the world, to show solidarity with freedom of expression, then it does not matter Who has been hurt by that
 mujhe yaad he ki 1989 main maine is patrika ke liye rushdi ke fatve par cover story kii thi or leone vicelcier kaa ek khatarnaak uddhran istemaal kiya tha jo da new republic ke sahitya sampadak hua karte the, ''main kufr ke liye ishwar kaa shukraguzaar hum kyonki kufr ne hi hamen mukt kiya he
 "I stand with Rushdie's freedom to write, but will i print it to show solidarity with freedom of expression?" i will not be able to do this
 kya main kufr ke bachaav main die gaye vicelcier ke us aakraamak kathan ko chhapane se roak duungaa? katai nahin
 Shall i write, print something that is actually considered cult blasphemy? My answer will be no more
 ab aap meri daleel ke donon siron ko shaayad pakad paa rahe honge
 My commitment to freedom of expression is total and unconditional
 main aapaki bolne kii aazaadee ke adhikaar kii raksha kisi bhi keemat par karata rahoonga, bhale hi main khud usase asahmat hum or ise khinchate hue main yah bhi kahana chaahunga ki mere asahmat hone kaa adhikaar utana hi akshunn he jitna aapaki abhivyakti kii aazaadee kaa adhikaar
 There is little risk in what I'm going to say now in a world boiling over an incident this week: i politely refuse to show solidarity with freedom of expression and point fingers at the killers by reprinting those cartoons
 or main # jesuischarlie (main charlie hum) hashtag ke saath twit bhi nahin karuunga
 If i am still asked to choose a repertoire on this issue, i will bet on my hard earned money in life, my liberal and secular status (nowadays Liberals and Seculars are abused as Libtards and Seculars anyway) and say - -I Am NOT Charlie
 phir bhi, main charlie kii abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke adhikaar kii raksha karuunga, chaahe ve cartoon kitne bhi bure kyon na rahe hon
 When it is nurtured and all you have to do is decide whether you are opposed to something or in favor, it is dangerous to make a complex or deliberate argument
 phir bhi main kahana chaahunga ki ek taraf abhivyakti kii aazaadee ke adhikaar kii puri tarah raksha karnaa or duusari ore ekajutata main chalaae gaye hashtag se twit karnaa apane aap main virodhabhasi baaten hai
 You should have the ability to criticize the person supporting the freedom of speech
 aap par yah dabaav nahin hona chahie ki aap usase sahamat hon yaa uske shabd yaa cartoon ko doharaaen
 Protecting someone's freedom of expression does not mean that you have to agree with the content of what he says
 mujhe apni is raay par vam, dakshin or madhyamargiyon kii ore se titarafa gaali sunani padegi, isliye main yaheen bilkul saaf kar dena chahta hum ki kisi bhartiya patr kaa sampadak hone kii sthiti main main in cartoonon ko nahin chhapata kyonki ye uske laayak nahin hai, anaavashyak rup se ghaatak hai or manoranjak to bilkul bhi nahin hai
 Just as i am politely denying the hashtag, i will not print these cartoons on social media to show my liberal and secular commitment
 yah baat maine kai baar kahi he or yah ek aisa saarvbhaumik satya he ki ek sampadak ke haathon main sabase badi takat or jimmedaari yah faisla karne kii hoti he ki vah kya chhaapega or kya nahin chhaapega, donon kii hi keemat use chaahe jo chukaani pade
 If something is intentionally made to hurt faith, i will refuse to fold my hands
 lekin yadi kahin or aisa kuch chhapane par aapako nishaanaa banaaya jaataa he to main aapaki raksha karne ke liye morche par data rahoonga
 Some natural questions will be raised on this side of me, which i already count here
 un muddon kaa kya jin par duusare dharmon ke log, khaskar hindu aahat mahasoos karte hai? jo log hindu bhagavaanon kaa apmaan karte hai ve islam or isiyat ko nishaanaa kyon nahin banaate? itnaa hi bataa dijie ki aamir khan or pike par aapaki kya raay he? unke bare main kya kahana he jo ramayana or mahabharat kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthaa rahe hai?em
 F
 
 What about Hussain and his pictures of Hindu goddesses? As far as my conscience is concerned, i will also apply the same editorial filter, which i have used in the case of the cartoons of Charley Abdo
 jisko jo kuch bhi karnaa ho yaa kahana ho, main uski aazaadee kii raksha karuunga, par main kuch se sahamat ho saktaa hum, kuch ko mahaj sweekaar kar saktaa hum or anya kii aalochana kar saktaa hum
 That is why i have no problem in defending PK because this film, according to Alien, attacks 'managers of Gods' Babas and nowadays this species is infamous anyway, even if all are not in jail
 jahaan tak hindu rudhipoon, andhvishwaason, murtipuja or reeti-rivaajon par hamale kaa sawaal he, to isamen kuch bhi aisa nayaa nahin he jo beeti sadiyon main mahaan sudhaarkon ne hamen na sikhaaya ho, chaahe gautam buddha rahe hon, gurunanak yaa phir maharishi dayanand
 Hinduism has been tolerant, orthodox and open to change, which is why it has spread and flourished
 aisa isliye he kyonki hindu dharm aalochanaon or nae vichaaron ke liye khulaa hua tha or isane sab kuch ko apane bheetar pachaa liya
 In the case of Hussain, at the Bangalore Literature Festival last year, there was a lot of friction
 mere hisaab se hossain beshak hindu deviyon kii tasveeron ko banane ke liye aaazaad the, lekin jinaki aasthaa aahat hui unhen bhi to pradarshan karne or adaalat main jane kaa adhikaar tha, basharte ve aisa shantipurna tareeke se karte
 The beauty of liberal democracies lies in the fact that you have the right to oppose them
 supreme court ne hossain kaa utpeeda rokane ke liye unke khilaaf mukademon ko ek jagah dilli kii ek adaalat main kendrit karke sahi nirnay liya tha
 There was a secular UPA government at that time and it would have been better if they had stayed here and fought for justice instead of making these cases an excuse for their permanent stay in a country where the sun of religious freedom is not shining at least
 bilkul isi tarj par maine kaha tha ki deepa mehta ne ek hindu madhyavargeey parivaar main prem se vanchit do mahilaon ke bich samalangik rishte dikhaakar kuch bhi galat nahin kiya
 It was not a crime, but was it necessary to name the names of Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das Sita and Radha? The controversy arising out of the guise of liberalism for harming a faith will give you publicity, fame and commercial success
 udaar loktantron main aahat logon ko kanoon ke daayre main virodh karne kaa adhikaar mil jayega
 Yes, if someone does violence to you, then i will stand in defense of you
 iske baavjood main is birdari ke saath chipke rahane ke liye mulammaa apane upar nahin chadhaaungaa, chaahe vah # amhusain kaa hashtag ho yaa # amcharlie

 He said that it has become necessary at this time to use marshals for the smooth functioning of the Parliament

 The institution of marshals has not been used since 2004 to run the business smoothly in Parliament

 The Congress General Secretary's tweet came at a time when the first week of the Winter Session of Parliament went without functioning due to hiccups on several issues

 Singh said in another tweet message that there is no connection between the statement of BJP leader Yashwant Sinha on inflation and Anna Hazare's statement of 'just a slap' after the attack on Union Minister Sharad Pawar
 unhone kaha, ‘sharad pavarji par kaayartapurna hamale kii kadi ninda karata hum
 Yashwant Sinha's statement, reaction to this incident, Anna
 in sabamein koi sambandh to nahin
 "yashwant Sinha had said that" If the government keeps sleeping, inflation can cause violence in the country
 ’digvijay singh ne kaha, ‘aisi ummid kabhi nahin kii thi ki anna sharad pavaar ke maamle main is tarah kii pratikriya denge
 This was certainly not a Gandhian response
 ’ singh ne do anya twit sandeshon main apni daleel ko jari rakhaa
