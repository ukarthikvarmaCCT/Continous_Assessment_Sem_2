 uttar pradesh ke firebrands mukhyamantriyogi adityanathane vaale samay main pradhanmantri narendra modi ko chunauti dete hue dikh sakate hai
 It is the belief of the people of the country
 india today or karvi insite mood of da nesan ke survey se yah baat nikal kar saamne ai he
 In this survey conducted in 19 states, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath defeated even bjp's big leaders Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh and LK Advani
 july 2017 main hue is survey main yogi adityanath logon ke chahete banakar ubhare
 He was considered by 13 percent to be the rival leader of Modi
 india today or karvi insite ke is survey main sawaal kiya gaya tha ki bijepi or sangh parivaar main aisa koun sa netaa he jonarendra modiko aglaa pradhanmantri banane main chunauti de saktaa he ?sushamaa swaraj se mili kadi takkaravahin is survey main sirf akele yogi adityanath ko janata kaa pyaar nahin mila
 He also had a tough fight with Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh
 yogi ke baad sushamaa swaraj, arun jetali, rajnath singh sabhi ko das pratishat vot mili
 However, despite being in the center, this leader did not stand in front of Yogi's popularity and had to be satisfied with number two
 diggaj peeche chhutevahin is survey se saaf ho gaya ki zyaadaatar janata ab peeche mud kar nahin dekhnaa chaahati he
 This is the reason why LK Advani, Murali Manohar Joshi etc
 were seen in the survey
 laalkrishna adwani ko jahaan 7 pratishat or murali manohar joshi ko 5 pratishat vot se santusht hona padaa
 The people of India do not want to be seen doing the lead, but the people of India do not consider Amit Shah, Venkaiah Naidu, Mohan Bhagwat, Devendra Fadnavis and Shivraj Singh Chauhan as the leaders of Modi's competition
 yahi vajah he ki inhen survey main niraashaa hi haath lagi
 Shivraj Singh got 5, Amit Shah 4, Venkaiah Naidu 3, Mohan Bhagwat 3 and Devendra Fadnavis got only 2 percent votes
 inke alaava anya netaaon ko bas 4 pratishat mat mili
 Modi's fire also came out of the proceedings that many people are unable to decide or think who can be an alternative to Modi? There were 24 per cent people who could not decide who could challenge Modi
 isse yah baat sabit hoti he ki abhi bhi piem narendra modi logon kii bich apni taqatvar chhavi banaae hue hai
 Why Yogi became No
1 substitute Adityanath's real name is Ajay Singh Negi
 wo gorakhpur ke prasiddh gorakhnath mandir ke mahant hai
 Adityanath is the successor of Avaidyanath, a former Mahant of the Gorakhnath temple
 wo hindu yuva vahini ke sansthaapak bhi hai, jo ki hindu yuvaaon kaa saamaajik, saanskrithik or rashtravaadi samooh he
 Yogi Adityanath has been continuously representing Gorakhpur region since 1998
 yogi upi bijepi ke bade chehre maane jate hai
 In 2014, Yogi became MP for the fifth time
 vahiin uttar pradesh kaa mukhyamantri banane ke baad yogi deshbhar main kaaphi popular hue hai
 After becoming CM, his strength is also increasing continuously
 gorakhpur main bacchon kii maut jaise kuch vivaadon ke baavjood unki chhavi abhi ek taqatvar siem kii he
 This survey also proves that people want to see him becoming an alternative to Modi

 The right side has a volume rocker and power button and a micro USB port with a speaker grill in the bottom
 headphone jaik upar kii taraf he
 You get a charger in the box of Redmi 7A
 yearphones company nahin detii or iske saath koi cese bhi nahin diya gaya he
 Talking about build quality, Redmi 7A is of hard plastic, but gives a feel of metal, because the quality is good
 luk and filluk and feel ke maamle main ye phone compact lagata he
 There is definitely a little bit in hand
 lekin ye dekhne main vaaki durable lagata he
 The company did the drop test, but we have not done its drop test
 displaceshedmi 7A kii disple 5
 45 inches
 IPS panel yuj kiya gaya he or ye HD+ he
 Talking about the aspect ratio, it is 18: 9
 phone kii disple brit he or thik thaak hi he, khaas kuch bhi nahin he
 The display could have done well
 lekin agar aap keemat ko dekhen to is keemat par aapako isse better disple nahin mil saktaa he
 Still, it would have been better if the company had given a better display
 ab shaayad aap kanphyus ho rahe honge
 Do not get confused, you will not be disappointed with the display
 disple main bejals hai ye dhyaan rakhen
 The response to the display has been good as long as it is used
 parformenssidhe aate hai Redmi 7A kii parformens par
 The Redmi 7A has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 processor and comes with two memory variants
 ek main 2GB ram ke saath 16GB memory, duusare verient main 2GB ram ke saath 32GB kii storage
 There is also a micro SD card slot
 koi bhi verient len parformens par koi khaas fark nahin dikhegaa
 For basic use, this Rs 5,999 Redmi 7A is fantastic
 fast he, smood he or stable he
 This is not a phone for heavy use
 bade game nahin khel sakate hai
 All social media related apps like Facebook, Insta, whatsapp, Messenger, Telegram and dozens of such apps work well without stopping
 phone main kuch pre loded eps bhi haa jo persenalee mujhe nahin pasand hai
 Redmi 7A has Android 9 Pie based MIUI 10
 company ne is yujar interphes main kaaphi impruvement kiya he aisa ham pehali baar nahin kah rahe, pehle bhi kaha he
 Dark mode has been given and using it has been a good experience
 Redmi 7A main fingerprint scinar naam kii koi cheez nahin he
 Pin, pattern and face unlock to lock
 phase analock selfi camera besd he or ye sicyor nahin he
 However, if you want to use it, you can
 haalanki kai baar ye phase ditection main thodaa vakt lagaataa he
 But slowly you understand it, then you will feel fast
 ap switch karne main zyada dikkat nahin he
 Yes, if you switch from one app to another, you will definitely feel a bit weak response and will notice a little time in loading as well
 lekin chunki is phone ko entry level se thodaa upar ke segment main rakhaa gaya he, isliye iske liye shikaayat nahin kar sakate hai
 The phone is also good for videos, music and calling
 basic yuj main hamane isamen koi dikkat nahin pai he
 In these four days, there was no problem of hang in the phone, so Thumbs Up
 first time smartphone yugers ke liye ye phone kaaphi shandaar package sabit ho saktaa he, kyonki iskaa camera bhi badhiya he
 Now let's talk about the camera
 cameraedmi 7A main vahi camera sensor diya gaya he jo Redmi Note 7 or Mi A2 main diya gaya he
 But is the camera performance also the level of those smartphones? The answer is no
 camera parformens un smartfones ke level kaa nahin he, kyonki isamen ek lens diya gaya he or ye smartphone duusare segment kaa bhi he to vaisaa ummid karnaa bhi galat hoga
 The rear camera is of 12 megapixels
 Redmi 7A main single rier camera diya gaya he or isamen company ne Sony IMX486 sensor diya gaya he
 There is no phone for photography, but Decent photo gets clicked
 khaas kar raushnee acchhee he to aisi photo aap clic kar lenge jise instagram or fasebuk par aplod kar saken
 The camera also has Pro mode
 in cese agar aapako kuch nayaa karne kaa man he to ise bhi tri kar sakate hai, maine tri kiya to isse kuch khaas behatar rigelt nahin mil paaya
 Features like AI beautification are provided in the camera
 Redmi 7A se acchhee tasviren clic karne ke liye aapako thodaa vakt dena hoga
 It takes time to focus from its camera, but its result is good
 HDR bhi thik thaak kaam karata he
 The camera disappoints in low light
 kul mila kar phir se ham vahi baat kahenge, jo shaayad aapako boring lage
 You will find its photography at this price
 kahin na kahin shaomi ke smartfones kii USP bhi yahi he or shaayad yahi vajah bhi he ki company is segment main number-1 he, khaas kar bhartiya market main
 Battery Redmi 7A has a battery of 4,000mah

 You can backup for more than a day by full charge
 phul charge karne main lagbhag 2 ghante lagate hai
 If you do not use the phone much, then it will take backup for two days

 Click photos, social media apps and listening to songs for an hour
 Redmi 7A ek shandaar package he, lekin--- is smartphone ke ek verient main 3GB ram verient hone chahie the
 --- The display could have been improved further
 kya aapako ye smartphone khareednaa chahie?5,999 rupee vaala verient aap kharid sakate hai
 In this segment, it will not get a better smartphone
 duusari companiyon ko shaomi se sabak lenaa chahie
 But if you can invest Rs 1,000 more then the Galaxy M10 will be right for you at this time
 Galaxy M10 ko amejon kii website se 6,999 rupee main kharida ja saktaa he
 This smartphone also offers a great water drop notch style display with a dual camera

 kyonki in prajatiyon kii aabaadi ghat rahi he, khatm nahin hui he

 org / US President Donald Trump has dismissed reports of 'good relations' with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un
 beete dinon media main ye khabaren ain thim ki trump ne north korea ke taanashaah par naram rukh apanaaya he or jald donon netaaon ke bich baatcheet bhi ho sakati he
 President Trump on Sunday dismissed such reports and called them fake
 saath hi trump ne kaha ki media main unke bayanon ko galat tareeke se prakashit kiya gaya he
 Significantly, on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported in a news report that Trump had developed a positive relationship with the leader of North Korea despite mutual differences
 khabar ke mutabik trump ne kaha tha, ‘mere sambhavat: kim jong un ke saath kaaphi achche sambandh hai, mere logon ke saath sambandh hai, mujhe lagata he ki aap log hairaan hai
 'trump said that the newspaper was well aware of what he said but he only wanted fake news
 america raashtrapati trump ne kaha, ‘wal street jarnal ne galat tareeke se bataaya ki ki maine unase kaha ki mere kim jong un ke saath achche sambandh hai
 Obviously i did not say that
 ’ raashtrapati ne kaha, ‘maine yah kaha tha ki mere purv main kim jong un ke saath achche sambandh the, donon main bada antar he
 'kim was threatened
 Donald Trump had retaliated after Kim's threat in the past and tweeted that someone in his hunger-affected country of North Korea should tell me that i too have a nuclear button
 trump ne apane twit main likhaa he, 'koi kim jong un ko bataae kimere paas bhi newcleearbatan he, jo uske batan se bahut bada or taqatvar he
 My button works
 ' When publicity becomes effective, it quickly turns into conventional wisdom

 In fact, the new form of this old spectacle was seen by the Nazis as a campaign to promote Hitler's pseudo-white Arya craze in the 1936 Berlin spectacle

 Now the Parliamentary Committee has asked the Ministry of Agriculture till December 18 to answer the questions raised by the mps
 rus main kuch tatwon dwaara bhagavat gita par pratibandh lagaae jane ke prayaason ko sarkaar ne purnat: behuda harakat bataate hue aaj vishwaas jataayaa ki is mitra desh kii sarkaar is maamle ke samaadhaan kii disha main uchit kadam uthaaegi
 Foreign Affairs Minister SM Krishna said in a public statement that the government took the matter very seriously after a strong condemnation in the Parliament of banning the Bhagavad Gita as a "militant literature" in a court in Siberia, Russia
 And it has been raised to a higher level with the Russian government
 krishna ne kaha ki rus kii sthaneey adaalat main bhagavat gita ke bare main kii gayi yah shikaayat ‘kisi agyani yaa bhatke hue nihit swaarthon se prerit vyaktiyon dwaara kiya gaya kaam lagata hota he
 "he said," Although this complaint is completely meaningless, we have taken the matter seriously and the Indian Embassy is keeping a close watch on this legal matter
 is mudde par sadasyon kii bhaavana se sarkaar ko puri tarah sabaddh karte hue videsh mantri ne kaha, ‘hamen vishwaas he ki hamaare roosi mitra, jo hamari sabhyataa ke mulyon evam saanskrithik samvedansheeltaa ko samajhate hai, is masale kaa upyukt samaadhaan kar lenge
 Expressing satisfaction over the government's reply, the members thumped the tables and welcomed it

 sarkaar kii ore se die bayaan main kaha gaya ki june 2011 main is maamle ke prakaash main aane ke baad se hi masco sthit bhartiya duutavas ke adhikari tathaa hamaare rajdoot iskan ke sthaneey pratinidhiyon ke saath niyamit sampark main hai
 ISKCON representatives have been advised to follow the legal process to oppose this misleading complaint
 krishna ne bataaya ki is maamle ko bharat sthit rus ke rajdoot alexandar kadakin ke saath bhi uthaaya gaya he, jo swayan vikhyath bharat vigyaani hai
 Kadakin strongly condemned this incident and said that Bhagavad Gita is a great source of knowledge for the people of India and the world
 unhone bharosa dilaayaa he ki rus dharmanirpeksh desh he jahaan sabhi dharmo kaa sammaan kiya jaataa he
 The Foreign Minister said that the book about which complained in the local court of Russia is the Russian translation of the third Russian edition of the publication 'bhagavad Gita Yatha Swarup', a translation of discourses given by ISKCAN founder Swami Prabhupada
 iske kuch bhaagon ko ‘ugravadi vichaardhaara’ se sambandhit bataate hue siberia kii adaalat main ise pratibandhit karne kii yachika daayar kii gai he
 The court had to pass a verdict on the passing Somavar, but has now deferred the decision till December 28
 adaalat ne rus ke kuch bharat vigyaniyon or visheshgyon tathaa maanavadhikaar sansthaaon kii raay sunne ke baad aisa kiya he

 In such a situation, the rest of the party including Congress are desperate to make their place
 belatara se pehle sipat vidhansabha hua karata tha
 In 2008, after delimitation, Beltara assembly seat was formed in place of Sipat
 bataa den ki sipat vidhansabha par basapa kaa kabja tha
 Rameshwar Khare was the MLA from here
 basapa se pehle yah congress kaa garh hua karata tha
 From here, Radheshyam Shukla, Chandraprakash Bajpai, Arun Tiwari became mlas, but since 2003 the Beltara Assembly is under the bjp's possession
 yahaan se badridhar dewan chunaav jitate aae hai
 The 2008 assembly result was bjp's Badridhar Dewan with 38867 votes
 congress ke bhuneshwar prasad yadav ko 33891 vot mili the
 2013 election results: Badrihar Diwan of BJP got 50890 votes
 congress ke bhuneshwar prasad yadav ko 45162 vot mili the
 Interestingly, 45 candidates were in the fray in 2013
 shahari kshetra se jude hone kii vajah se belatara vidhansabha kshetra ke nattejey bijepi ke paksh main jaataa rahaa he
 Before the formation of Chhattisgarh, Diwan from Sipat had won once before in the 1990 elections in Madhya Pradesh

 It is reported that senior party leader LK Advani wanted to lead the party's election campaign in 2014 to former president Nitin Gadkari
 is silsile main donon netaaon ke bich baithak bhi hui
 However, Gadkari turned down Advani's proposal
 sutron ke mutabik nitin gadakari ne nagpur seat se khud loksabhaa chunaav ladane ke kaaran apni asamarthta jataai
 He said that he would not be able to take full time for this responsibility due to his election
 vahiin, party main modi ke samarthak chaahate hai ki chunaav prachaar ke netritv ko lekar jald faisla hona chahie, kyonki samay se pehle loksabhaa chunaav ko nahin nakaara ja saktaa
 In such a situation, the party should not be left behind
 modi kheme ke logon kaa kahana he ki iskaa faisla jald ho taaki gujarat ke mukhyamantri ko chunavi ranneeti ke liye samay mili
 It is worth mentioning that when Gadkari was the president of the party, it was at that time that there was a matter of giving the command of the campaign to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi
 aise main adwani kaa gadakari ko yah prastaav dena unki modi se badhati duriyon kii ore ishaara karti hai
 The news of differences between the two leaders also came to light when Advani, in his speech, hinted that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh was better known as Shivraj Singh Chauhan than Modi
 vivaad hone ke baad party adhyaksh rajnath singh ko bayaan par khud safai deni padi
 At the same time, Shivraj Singh tried to cool the matter by calling himself a junior to Modi
 jab adwani ne kii shivaraj singh chouhan kii tarifgauratlab he ki adwani ne madhyapradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan kii purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi se tulana karte hue donon ko ahankaar se pare bataaya, jabaki unhone vikaas ke liye shivaraj kii tulana gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi se kii
 In the gestures, Shivraj Singh Chauhan was also said to be better than Modi
 adwani ne kaha tha ki gujarat pehle se hi ‘swasth’ rajya he or modi ne ise ‘shandaar’ rajya main badal diya lekin chouhan or chhattisgarh mukhyamantri raman singh bimaaru rajyon ko viksit rajya main badalane main safal rahe
 Shivraj and Rajnath Singh had to give up the cleaning
 Shivraj said that Advani also praised Modi and Raman Singh, i was third
 narendra modi or raman singh mujhase senior hai
 At the same time, BJP President Rajnath Singh said that LK Advani's statement was misunderstood

 bataa den ki pradhanmantri ne logon se raay maangi thi ki unhen 15 agast ke bhaashan main kin vishyon par baat kerani chahie, jiske jawaab main kuch aisi baaten hai, jo shaayad piem ke bhaashan main jagah bana paaengi
 
 
 India to be made a plastic bag-free country Medical health insurance for people
 Volunteers (information officers) across the country should work to make public schemes accessible to the people
 In the field of education, former President APJ Abdul Kalam started a scheme
 To establish a research center at the national level for different professions, Smart Village (village) was also formed on the lines of Smart City Go to a website describing the achievements of India, a helpline at the national level for women security - planning for plantation across the country india today conklev main dalit netaa or bharip bahujan mahasang ke netaa or dow
 Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Bhimrao Ambedkar, said that there is no difference between BJP and Congress
 bhaajapa kattar hindutvvaadi he to congress naram hindutvvaadi he
 Both follow each other's way of working
 haa bas us kaam ke varshon main antar ho jaataa he
 Meaning the work that Congress has done earlier, today BJP is doing the same thing
 prakaash ambedkar ne kaha ki aaj mere dada dow
 If Bhimrao Ambedkar would have been very sad to see the country and its constitution
 kyonki aaj kii sarkaar samvidhan kii dhajjiyaan uda rahi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi is getting this work done
 main chahta hum ki modi aage badhen or deshhit main lanbaa kaarykaal chalaaen
 Whereas, i am his opponent
 bharat ke itihaas main ab tak ke sabase kharaab pradhanmantri rahe hai narendra modi
 They are destroying the country
 wo us dhaage ko tod rahe hai jisase desh ke log aapas main jude the
 Prakash Ambedkar, who was the loser, had asked the Congress that in the Lok Sabha elections i had told the Congress to give the seat which you are going to lose
 jeetne vaali siten to maangi bhi nahin thi
 But the Congress refused
 kyonki, unhen dar tha ki ham jeet jaaenge or unki siten kam ho jaaengi
 We garnered 40 lakh votes in the election
 iskaa logon ko sammaan karnaa chahie
 People have to believe that a new force is being created
 garib or dabe-kuchle logon kii aawaaj upar uth rahi he
 Earlier Congress used to be opposed in the country, now BJP happens
 Prakash Ambedkar said that he opposes BJP and Shiv Sena
 unhone kaha ki pehle log congress kaa virodh karte the
 Now BJP and Shiv Sena do it
 log kehete hai ki ham bhaajapa kii bi-team hai
 But people also know that we were once very young
 obisi or chote tabake ke log kahaan jaaenge
 Neither Congress was listening to him, nor BJP
 unke paas koi opshan nahin tha
 So we formed our own party
 ye baat galat he ki ham bhaajapa kii bi-team hai
 The helicopter we met in the Lok Sabha elections with the help of the central government, has been paid by donation
 hamaari party ko donneton miltaa he or ye paisa janata kaa hota he
 We contested public money
 sabhi partiyaan jati kii raajnneeti kar rahi hai, main akelaa nahin humprakash ambedkar ne kaha ki jab log kehete hai ki aap nichle tabake kii baat karte hai to kya ye jati kii raajnneeti nahin he
 So tell me which party does not do caste politics
 kya aap mujhe ek candidet bataaenge jo nichle tabake se jitkar vidhansabha yaa loksabhaa main pahunchaa ho
 Caste politics is already happening
 ye sabhi partiyaan kar rahi hai
 i just want to bring these people into the mainstream of democracy
 main chahta hum ki maharashtra main barabari ho or ye har maamle main ho
 Go from the watery area to the dry area
 sabhi bacchon ke baraabar or puri shiksha mili
 Employment in the state
