 There is nothing clear about who will be the symbol of the cycle after the internal discord in Samajwadi Party

 Nijalingappa and Indira Gandhi, the Election Commission observed that neither of the two groups followed the party constitution rules
 es nizlingappa ne party samvidhan ko aadhaar banaakar hi congress par apana daawa kiya tha
 Second criterion: The second criterion would be to take seriously the aims and objectives of the constitution

 The third criterion is the third criterion for which majority

 After this, the claims and pleas of various factions of the parties have been tightened on these criteria to settle the dispute in cases of political differences, dispute and breakdown in the parties
 saath hi faisle bhi inhi aadhaar par hote rahe hai
 This time too, if the controversy in Mulayam and Akhilesh group increased more, then these criteria can become the basis

 (input from IANS) (input ieenes se) His ally Shiv Sena, often angered over the completion of three years of Maharashtra's Devendra Fadnavis government, said that it had supported Fadnavis for this post with a 'big heart' but if people thought that he could be replaced with 'bedbugs' too If he had gone, he should not be held responsible for this
 fadanvis ne bhaajapa ke lambey samay se sahyogi dal shivasena par somvaar ko nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki shivasena ko yah pataa hona chahie ki vah sattarudh dal or vipaksh kii bhoomika saath saath nahin nibhaa sakati he
 The Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'saamana' said in an editorial, "we had wholeheartedly supported you on the Chief Minister's post for development and 'good days' in the state
" lekin agar log sochate hai ki khatmal bhi aapse behatar kaam kar lete to iske liye shivasena jimmedaar nahin he
 '' saamana main fadanvis par apane sahyogi dal ke bare main ‘jhooth’ bolne kaa aarope bhi lagaaya gaya he
 "not a single development work has been done and you are lying white against the Shiv Sena," the editorial said
 ’’ isamen kaha gaya he ki rajya ke log khush nahin he or satta main baithe logon par vishwaas nahin karte
 "the Chief Minister says that the Shiv Sena stumbles in the path of development," says the editorial
 agar yah sach he to mukhyamantri hone ke naate vah kya kar rahe hai? unhen aise kisi bhi shaks ko bakhshana nahin chahie jo vikaas ko baadhit karata he
 '' mukhpatr main kaha gaya he ki satta kaa istemaal raajnneeti ke bajaay jan kalyaan ke liye zyada hona chahie
 In the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Fadnavis was quipped over Sharad Pawar's support by NCP in the absence of a clear majority after the assembly elections
 isamen kaha gaya he, ‘‘kal chunaavon ke dauraan koun aapke saath hoga, iskaa faisla aapako karnaa he
 If Shiv Sena is not with you, then you have already decided to seek the support of those who are accused of irrigation scam
 ’’ gauratlab he ki rakanpa ke kuch netaa bhrashtachar ke aaropon ko lekar jaanch kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 The comments rajya vidhansabha chunaav main kisi bhi party ko spasht bahumat naa milane ke baad rakanpa ne fadanvis sarkaar ko baahar se samarthan dene kii peshkash kii thi
 Shiv Sena said whether it was a crime to stand with them during the agitation of farmers demanding minimum support price and crop loan waiver for their produce
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri kaushal vikaas, rojgaar srijan, videshi nivesh, shiksha, mahila or bal vikaas tathaa kanoon evam vyavastha ke kshetron main kiye ja rahe mahatvapurn kaam ke bare main baat karte hai
 If these things have been done in the last three years, then how can they say that the Shiv Sena stumbles in the path of development
 (is khabar ko enditivi team ne sampadit nahin kiya he
 It is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) In the confrontation, Fadnavis has also been accused of telling 'lies' about his ally
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘‘ek bhi vikaas kaary nahin kiya gaya or aap shivasena ke khilaaf safed jhooth bol rahe hai
 "it states that the people of the state are not happy and do not believe in those in power
" sampadakeey main kaha gaya he, ‘‘mukhyamantri kehete hai ki shivasena vikaas kii raah main rode atakati he
 If this is true then what is he doing as Chief Minister? They should not spare anyone who impedes development
 ’’ The mouthpiece states that power should be used more for public welfare rather than politics
 shivasena ke mukhpatr main vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad spasht bahumat naa milane par sharad pavaar kii rakanpa dwaara samarthan dene ko lekar fadanvis par chutki lee gai
 It says, "you have to decide who will be with you during the elections tomorrow
" agar shivasena aapke saath nahin he to aapane pehle hi un logon kaa samarthan lene kaa faisla kar liya he jo sinchai ghotaale ke aaropee hai
 Significantly, some NCP leaders are facing scrutiny over allegations of corruption
 tippaniyan The NCP had offered outside support to the Fadnavis government after no party got a clear majority in the state assembly elections
 shivasena ne kaha ki kya apane utpaada ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya or fasal karj maafee kii maang kar rahe kisaanon ke andolan ke dauraan unke saath khadey hona uskaa gunaah tha
 The editorial says that the Chief Minister talks about the important work being done in the areas of skill development, employment generation, foreign investment, education, women and child development and law and order
 agar pichley teen saal main ye kaam kiye gaye hai to vah kaise kah sakate hai ki shivasena vikaas kii raah main rode atakati he

 aaie jaanate hai khud ko mentin rakhane ke liye kya kuch karti hai namrata soni kya he unka beauty sikret
 Do this every day Skin care- Makeup Maestro Namrata Soni says that to keep the skin beautiful, you must have a good company moisturizer, sunscreen cream and night cream
 iske alaava khud ko aakarshith banaae rakhane ke liye aap lip balm, kaajal pencil, muskara, or ek acchhee bibi kriim kaa istemaal karen
 Namrata believes that you do not need to apply a lot of makeup on your face to look good
 aap in teen chizon kii madad se bhi khubasurat dikh sakati hai
 Keep suntan away like this To save the skin from sunlight and suntan, Namrata Soni recommends using sunscreen cream of a good company with SPF 50
 iske alaava san ten thik karne ke liye wo besan or doodh ko bhi chehre par lagane kii salaah detii hai
 Does applying makeup really make the skin bad - Eliminating the biggest confusion of people associated with makeup, Namrata Soni said that applying makeup on the face does not spoil the skin but keeps the dust from dust

 Makeup prevents all these from entering the open pores of the face

 isse pehle party adhyaksh ne 'mishan 350+' ko lekar saansadon ke saath baithak kii thi
 The oath taking ceremony was held at Rashtrapati Bhavan
 mukhtaar abbaas nakvi, nirmala sitaraman, piyush goyal or dharmedra pradhan ko pramotion diya gaya he
 He has been given cabinet status from the Minister of State
 anant hegade, virendra kumaar or hardev singh puri ko mantri banaaya gaya he
 In the Rajya Sabha on July 27, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju informed that 26 states and union territories including Gujarat, Assam, West Bengal, Odisha are in the grip of flood-rains and 508 have lost their lives
 8 lakh hectare fasali jameen baadh se ai aapadaa kii chapet main he or 63 lakh se zyada ghar kshatigrast ho gaye hai
 This time Gujarat suffered the most loss of life and property, where more than 200 people have lost their lives
 rigiju ne yah bhi kaha, ''monsoon ke dauraan har saal june se sitambar tak desh main baari barish hoti he
 
 
 Flooding of rivers as a result of rainfall is a natural tendency of the season
 " baadh or barish kaa yah sach har saal desh ke saamne aata he lekin niyantrak or mahalekha pareekshak (sieji) ne pichley nau saal ke dauraan baadh ke peeche kii jo kahani apni report main di he vah kuch or hi hakeekat bayaan karti he
 Dams and floods are related issues
 purvasuchana or taiyaari hi isse bachane kaa upaay he
 Telemetry stations are needed to get flood forecasts from where information is transmitted but about 60 percent of the stations are not working
 sieji report ke mutabik, barahavin panchavarshiya yojana main 219 telemitries stesan lagane kaa lakshya rakhaa gaya lekin keval 56 stesan hi 2016 tak lagaae gaye
 Out of a total of 375 telemetry stations, 222 are stalled, due to which real time data of water level and other seasonal information is not available
 20 saal tak telemitries steshnon ke aadhunikeekaran par kharch karne ke baavjood rashtriya jal ayog ko sthaneey data par nirbhar rahanaa padataa he, jisase chook kii ashanka bani rahati he
 Another fact is that the central government can issue flood warnings to the states but cannot force them to make arrangements and the state machinery sometimes ignores the warning
 report kahati he ki odisha ke hirakud baandh main pani kaa str santulit na rakhane ke kaaran achaanak 50 get khol die gaye, jisase nichle ilaake pani main samaa gaye
 In the 20 days from August to September 2011, the Central Water Commission had issued several warnings to increase the water level of Mahanadi due to heavy rains in Chhattisgarh and Odisha but dam officials did not pay attention and caused heavy flooding in September 13 districts were affected and two thousand crore rupees
 kaa aarthik nuksaan hua
 The lesson was not taken from this, the same story was repeated in 2014
 nateeja bhi vahi rahaah mahanadi basin main baadh aa gai
 In June 2013, no forecast of flood was given in Alaknanda in Uttarakhand
 march 2016 tak 4,862 bade baandhon main se maatr 349 (7 fisadi) ke liye hi immergency acshan plan / dizaster management plan taiyaar kiya gaya
 Of these, only 231 (five per cent) operating manual was prepared
 uttar pradesh ke 115 main se sirf 2, madhya pradesh ke 898 main 2, maharashtra ke 1,693 main se 181 jabaki odisha, rajasthan, telugana, tripura, haryana ne koi immergency acshan plan banaaya hi nahin
 Of the 17 states and union territories, only two have fully inspected the dams before and after the monsoon while 12 states have no inspection of any kind
 is report ko taiyaar karne main sieji ne 206 flud management project, 38 flud forcasting stesan, 49 river management activities, 68 bade baandh, 17 chuninda rajya or centreshasit pradeshon kaa sample 2007-08 se 2015-2016 tak sample liya
 It also presents an assessment of flood control works
 11veen or 12veen yojana ke nau saal main 12,242
 Works worth Rs 88 crore were approved but the Ministry of Water Resources awarded Rs 4,723
 08 (39 fisadi) karod ru
 Issued only
 517 yojanaon main se 297 hi puri ho sakin (dekhen suchi)
 The ministry has not prepared a project-based statement of these figures
 jal sansaadhan mantralay kahata he ki kendriya madad main kami yaa to bajet main kam dhan ke aavanton ke kaaran yaa prastaav na dene yaa avyaavhaarik prastaav dene ke kaaran ai
 Projects are also getting delayed due to less budgetary support from the Center
 report ke mutabik, chaar rajyon main 48 pariyojnaon ko anmpaward cameti kii manjuuri ke baavjood kendriya sahaayta kii raashi milane main do se 48 maheenon kaa asaadhaaran vilamb hua
 Some other examples of lethality have also been reported in the report
 haridwar jile main bhogpur se balavaali tak 20
 11 of 5 km Marginal Dam
 92 karod ru
 The project was sent to the Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC) Patna in 1989, 20 after 2014, 25 years later
 69 karod ru
 i could complete it
 uttar pradesh ke siddharthanagar main kunra nadi kaa 15 kilometre lanbaa tatbandh bananaa tha taaki 1,696 hectare jameen ko baadh se bachaaya ja sake
 Project 10
 33 karod ru
 It was approved by the GFCC in 2006-07, but it was found in the opportunity inspection that it was only 8
 1 kilometre bana he
 It does not have regulators and 50-60 meters of space has been left for the regulator, making it meaningless

 Suspense has deepened as to whether there will be an alliance between BJP and Shiv Sena
 shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne apane jin do duuton ko bijepi se baatcheet ke liye dilli bheja tha, ve rajnath singh or jepi nadda se mili bina buudhvaar subah mumbai laut gaye
 Shiv Sena asked for the post of Deputy CM
 Let me tell you that Shiv Sena has given the command to Anil Desai and Subhash Desai to discuss the upcoming government
 donon netaa mangalvaar ko hi dilli aae the
 The two were scheduled to meet Rajnath Singh and JP Nadda on Wednesday, but returned to Mumbai without meeting
 aisa kyon hua, yah abhi saaf nahin ho sakaa he
 Sources reveal that talks are taking place behind the scenes between BJP and Shiv Sena to form government in Maharashtra
 aise main shivasena ke in netaaon ko koi sandesh uddhav tak pahunchaana hoga, is vajah se ve waapas laut gaye
 Experts say that the BJP Legislature Party leader has not yet been elected, so any discussion about the formulation of the government and the sharing of the ministry is meaningless
 bijepi kaa planbijepi sutara bataate hai ki party shivasena or uddhav thakare par dabaav banaae rakhana chaahati he taaki ve apni ummiido ko kam karen
 The BJP feels that there is tremendous pressure from Shiv Sena workers on Uddhav for participation in power
 bijepi ne madhyasthata karne vaale apni party ke netaaon ko salaah di he ki ve vinram rahen lekin anuchit maangon ke saamne bilkul naa jhuken
 If the Shiv Sena is unable to form an alliance, then the party is ready to run a minority government in Maharashtra, which will have the support of independents and outside NCP
 bijepi alaakaman ko lagata he ki sharad pavaar kaa baahar se samarthan dene ke elaan ek raajnneetik masterstroke he, is faisle ne shivasena kii saudebaaji kii takat ko kam kar di
 The demand for the Shiv Sena states that the Shiv Sena wants the government to form the 1995 coalition formula, according to which it was decided to be the chief minister of the big party and the deputy chief minister of the smaller party
 saath hi grih, vitt, sinchai, peedblyoody or gramin vikaas jaise mantralay bhi shivasena ke khate main aane kii baat thi
 But Om Mathur has given an indication of how much Shiv Sena will be considered in the present situation
 unhone kaha tha, '1995 kaa formula diya gaya tha to naa ham the or naa uddhav
 The sensible takes care of the present situation
 ' There has been a new twist in the female teacher case

 In this letter, Uttara Bahuguna was asked to join the school within a month
 aisa na karne par unki sevaayen samaapt karne kaa bhi aadesh tha
 However, during this period Uttara Bahuguna's husband was ill and died after some time
 aise samay unki maansik stithi kya hogi ye koi bhi samaj saktaa he
 This was the reason that she could not go to school till 2017 nor did she get any kind of notice
 vibhaag se bhi koi or jaankaree nahin mili
 Uttara Bahuguna joined the school again in 2017 after the situation returned to normal
 ab sawaal ye kii agar 2016 main unhen seva mukt kar diya gaya to phir 2017 main kaise wo skool jwine kar sakati hai
 In such a situation, questions are now arising on the administration that how the Education Secretary held a press conference without any knowledge
 agar press vaarta kii baat sahi he to phir is chitthee kaa koi auchity hi nahin rah jaataa
 The Education Secretary himself has said that Uttara Bahuguna's number is 59th in the list of promotions
 jiskaa matlab he ki sarkaar ko sahi baat kaa gyaan hi nahin he
 Significantly, during a press conference the government issued orders to suspend the female teacher Uttara and that too when the Chief Minister himself had ordered the officers to do so in his Janata Durbar a day before that
 vahiin duusari ore sarkaar ne hi unke seva samaapt notice kii chitthee ko shanivaar ko achaanak jari kar diya
 When Aajtak spoke to the female teacher, he told that on one hand he is being assured of justice on the education minister, on the other hand pressure of compromise is being made on him

 Firdaus won the first prize in the competition and it was a big thing that he won the hearts of all
 gita ke ye 12 upadesh dete hai safal hone kaa sandeshfirdaus ne skool kii guruma ko badi kakshaon ke bacchon ko bhagwad gita padhaate suna or kanthsth kar liya
 The head mistress Urmila Kar was surprised when the little Firdaus told her that she had memorized the Bhagavad Gita and could read better and unchallenged than any other student
 urmila car ne bataaya ki bhagwad gita ko padhaane kaa niyam he ki pehle paanch gadhy kaksha 1 se kaksha 3 ko padhaaye jate hai
 When i teach older children, i used to listen to Paradise
 puraa yaad karne ke baad wo mere paas ai or boli ki usne sab sikh liya he
 When i asked him to read it, it felt very good and far better than other students
 iske baad maine uski pratibha ko or nikhaarane ke liye kaam kiya

 The Bhagavad Gita is the national text: SK Nuruddin, father of Sushma Swarajfirdaus, works as a plumber in Dubai
 yahaan firdaus apni maa aripha bibi or bade bhai es ke salimuddin ke saath rahati hai

 wo jaise bhi aage badhanaa chaahati he, main uskaa samarthan karuungi
 i am happy and proud of her
 abhi wo bahut choti he, main use sab sikhaauungi
 When she grows up, i will also teach her the Quran
 'firdaus se jab gita paath kaa anubhav poocha gaya to usne kaha, 'main pehali kaksha main padhati hum
 i know both Sanskrit and Urdu
 main bhagwad gita bhi jaanati hum
 i used to listen when my guru mother taught

 The case is related to Majha village in Kaptanganj police station area, where Baliram, who resides, is accused of not saying farewell to his daughter-in-law
 peedit vivaahita kii maa kii shikaayat par mahila thane main mukadmaa darj hua
 Subsequently, the woman police station officer Suman Singh reached the house of the accused Baliram to investigate
 baliram ne ghar par katahal ke do ped lagaae the, jis par darjanon bade-bade katahal fale hue the
 The inspector got the eye of these trees
 aarope he ki jaanch karne ke badale daaroga ji ne ek katahal kii maang kar di
 Baliram and his family handed the woman SO a jackfruit and some 'nazarna'
 itnaa milte hi mahila daaroga ne cese ko hi jhootha qaraar dete hue ise khatm kar diya
 After the case was broken, the mother of the married woman is now forced to visit the SP office
 apni beti ko apane hi ghar laane ke liye jaddojahad kar rahi urmila devi kaa abpulice par se vishwaas khatm ho gayaahai

 jab bhi vah apni beti kii vidaai ke liye sasuraal jaati hai, to unke saath marpet kii jaati he
 When they exhausted and resorted to the police, the police registered a case, but she too was 'sold out' in a jackfruit
 aaj tak police na uski beti kii vidaai kara pai, na hi mukadmaa darj hone ke baad koi karrwai hi kii
 In such a situation, they are no longer expected from the police

 Through the letters printed in these posters in all the places in Delhi, Chief Minister Kejriwal has told PM Modi that the Delhi Police comes directly under your control and you do not have time, due to which the police has become completely autocratic
 us par kisi kaa control nahin bachaa he
 Chief Minister Kejriwal has written to the PM appealing that the people of Delhi are scared and crime in Delhi is increasing
 unhone piem se aagrah bhi kiya he ki vah kam se kam ek ghanta hafte main dilli waalon ke liye nikaalen or janata se mila karen taaki dilli kii kanoon vyavastha main sudhaar ho sake
 After failing to do this, CM Kejriwal told PM Modi that you should give control of the police to us and we will fix the system of Delhi Police with the people

 aisa nahin kar paane par siem kejariwal ne piem modi se kaha ki aap police kaa control hamen de dijie or ham janata ke saath milakar dilli police kii vyavastha thik kar denge
 Contrary to his one day old comment 'thulla', Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has written in this letter that it is not that the policemen are bad
 dilli police ke log bahut achche hai, lekin unka system kharaab he
 Those people themselves are very unhappy

 maharashtra kii gathbandhan sarkaar main paryaavaran mantri or shivasena ke varisht netaa ramdaas kadam kehete hai, ''bijepi ke netaa baar-baar unhen (thakare ko) 'mafia' kehete the
 We cannot tolerate such wrong language against our leader
 ''thakare ko ummid he ki unki party ko mumbai main kiye gaye vikaas ke jabardast kaamon kaa phayda milegaa
 His slogan in the elections is, 'je bolto te karoon dakhavato' (I fulfill what i say)
 ve khaskar pine ke pani ke liye bichhaae gaye pipon kii taraf dhyaan dilaate hai or pani nikaalane kii un behatar suvidhaon kii taraf bhi, jisaki vajah se shahar ko pehle kii tarah monsoon main pani ke jabardast bharaav se bachaaya ja sakaa he
 But the party is also facing a lot of criticism over allegations of corruption
 us par sadak banane ke kaamon main or mumbai ke kachare ke niptaare kii bheeshan chunauti se nibatane main baari bhrashtachar ke aarope lage hai
 Obviously, the BJP is trying to take advantage of this
 biemasi kaa uskaa puraa chunaav abhiyaan hi shivasena ke maatahat hue bhrashtachar par tikaa he
 Targeting BJP leader Vinod Tawde, "our principle is transparency
" ham paardarshee prashasan ke saath mumbai kaa vikaas karnaa chaahate hai
 Thackeray believes that the results of the BMC elections will reflect the mood of the voters in the financial capital of the country and will be a mandate on the Modi government's demonetisation move

 Sources close to Thackeray are talking of bringing more Gujaratis to the polls
 ve kehete hai, ''shivasena kaa har chatha ummidavaar gujarati hoga
 Political pundits say that the future of the bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra rests on the outcome of the BMC elections

 Hitting out at the Congress during the discussion in the Lok Sabha during the discussion on Jammu and Kashmir, the Home Minister said that "a chasm" was created between the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the people of India because there was no attempt to build trust beforehand
 Has gone
 '' shah ne kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak anuchhed 370 he, 
 
 
 It is temporary, not permanent
 370 hamaare samvidhan kaa asthaayee mudda he
 He said that those who want to break the country should have fear in their mind
 jammu-kashmir kii awam ke man dar nahin hona chahie
 Amit Shah said that after the Modi government came in, the terrorists were strictly dealt with
 unhone kaha, ‘‘ (congress netaa) manish tiwari aaj desh ke vibhaajan par sawaal uthaa rahe hai, main inase poochna chahta hum ki desh kaa vibhaajan kisne kiya tha? aaj kashmir kaa ek tihaai hissaa bharat ke paas nahin he, aisa kiske kaaran hua?''charchaa main bhaag lete hue tiwari ne desh ke vibhaajan kii sthiti kaa ullekh kiya or kaha ki hamaari sarkaar ne bhaajapa sarkaar ko shant evam surakshit kashmir saunpa tha
 Shah said that we are a government concerned about the movement of Kashmir
 aaj tak panchayaton ko panch or sarpanch chunane kaa adhikaar hi nahin diya gaya tha
 Shah said that "only three families continued to rule in Kashmir for so many years
" '' gram panchayat, nagar panchayat sab kaa shashan vahi karen or sarkaar bhi vahi chalaaen
 Why should this happen? After the reply of the Home Minister, the House gave a voice-over to the statutory proposal for imposing President's rule in Jammu and Kashmir and the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Amendment Bill 2019
 sawaal is baat kaa he jammu-kashmir se jude anuchhed 370 ko grahamantri amit shah ne jis andaaj main bataaya ki vah samvidhan kaa asthai mudda he,kya isaki vahi asaliyat he
 In the prime time of Ravish Kumar on this issue, Vice Chancellor of NALSAR University Faizan Mustafa says that this issue has been debated many times, and it has also been kept according to ideology
 unhone is par khud kaa koi vichaar rakhane ke bajaae kaha, 'yah supreme court ne kaha he ki anuchhed 370 kii heading main shabd tempereri (asthai) aa gaya he lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki vah ek tempereri praavdhaan he
 Had it been Temperari, 43 orders were issued in the last 70 years, which made most of the Constitution of India applicable to Kashmir
 to wo jo kuch hamane lagu kiya gaya he vah sab kuch khatm ho jayega agar hamane 370 ko asthai maan liya
 Faizan Mustafa, speaking of historical facts, said that the agreement under which Raja Hari Singh had joined India also had some conditions in it, 370 gives strength to those conditions
 isaki heading main tempereri shabd isliye rakhaa gaya tha kyonki isko jammu-kashmir kii samvidhan sabha ko dekhnaa tha
 Seeing this, the Constituent Assembly approved to keep it running
 jab kashmir kii samvidhan sabha ne is par mohar laga di to is sabha ko bhang kar diya gaya
 And now if there is any change in it, then it is written in Article 370 that for this, approval from the Constituent Assembly of Kashmir will have to be taken again
 lekin kyonki samvidhan sabha bhang kar di gai he to mana gaya ki ab anuchhed 370 sthai ho gaya he ab isamen kuch nahin ho saktaa he
 Faizan Mustafa further said that the second view is that if the people of Kashmir are to be considered on this, then approval of the Legislative Assembly is taken for it and it represents the people of the state
 iske saath hi unhone grahamantri amit shah kii us baat kaa bhi khandan kiya ki kashmir samasya nehru ji kii dein he
 He said that Pandit Nehru was a Kashmiri Brahmin and he heartily wanted to include Kashmir in India
 lekin sardaar vallabh bhai patel chaahate the ki kisi tarah hyderabad bharat main shaamil ho jaae chaahe kashmir pakistan chalaa jaae
 But Nehru was not persuaded
 faijan mustafa kaa kahana he ki agar aaj kashmir bharat kaa hissaa he to iskaa kuch shrey nehru ko bhi diya janaa chahie
 However, Faizan Mustafa accepted Amit Shah's view that during the Congress era, there was a mess in the elections in Jammu and Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki amit shah kaa yah kahana he ki vah kashmiriat ko dailyut nahin hone denge, yah sabit karata he ki vah ab statsman banane kii raah par hai

 jin logon ko goli lagi unki pahchaan restaurant maalik sachin (55) or akshay sharma (22) ke rup main hui, unka aspataal main ilaaj chal rahaa he
 At the same time, the miscreants escaped from there in their car, but the photographs captured in the CCTV located nearby identified the accused
 inke naam shahil, gopi or niku hai, mili jaankaree ke anusaar in par pehle se kai aapraadhik maamle darj hai
 Eyewitness Sahil said that when the incident happened, he was eating pizza at the time, in the meantime, the molestation incident occurred and then in a short time more boys came
 jab virodh kiya to badmaash sahil ko bhi peetane lage, is bich restaurant maalik sachin use bachaane aae to badmaashon ne goli chalaa di, jo unhen lag gai

 pakistan kulbhushan par ro kaa jasoos hone kaa aarope lagaataa rahaa he
 Pakistan says it has evidence of India's interference and espionage in Balochistan
 pakistan kii sena kii inter services public relation ne kaha he ki sena kii adaalat ne jadhav ko pakistan ke kilaaf yuddh chhedane or baluchistan main hinsa bhadakaane ke aarope main doshi paaya he
 Jadhav was prosecuted in the Field General Court Martial under the Pakistan Army Act

 Pakistan claimed that Jadhav was arrested in Balochistan on 3 March last year
 jadhav balooch algaavvaadiyon ko bhadkaa kar 46 arab dollar ke china-pakistan iconomik koridor ko nuksaan pahunchaana chahta tha
 India has always taken the position that it had no contact with Jadhav
 bharat hameshaa chahta he ki pakistan main sthirataa bani rahe
 Pakistan has made allegations till date but has never provided any evidence

 Last year, Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Adviser Sartaj Aziz had said in the Parliament that there were only statements by Kulbhushan Jadhav
 uske kilaaf koi thos saboot nahin he
 a few days later, Aziz overturned his statement and said that Jadhav would never be handed over to India

 India has responded by calling Pakistan High Commissioner Abdul Basit
 pakistan ke akhbaar don ne likhaa he ki kulbhushan ko kanoonee praavdhaanon ke anusaar bachaav paksh kaa vakil diya gaya tha

 Pakistan newspaper Dawn wrote that Kulbhushan was given a defense counsel as per the legal provisions
 akhbaar ke mutabik jadhav kaa trial or sazaa kaa elaan apratyaashit he
 Experts in Pakistan are seeing this as a strong message to India
 bharat ke export ummid kar rahe hai ki pakistan ko sadabuddhi aegi
 And they hope that the effort of the diplomats can prevent the punishment
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki bahut hi kam hota he ki kisi jasoos ko sazaa di jaati he
 The United States and Russia exchanged their spies during the Cold War
 bharat pakistan ke sambandhon ke nunatam str ke is daur main kya yah mumkin hoga ki kulbhushan ko insaaf mil sake
 Pakistan's Defense Minister Khwaja Asif has said that Kulbhushan Jadhav has been awarded death sentence according to the law
 yah sazaa dushmano ko chetavanee he
 Imran Khan's party tehreek-e-insaf has supported the death sentence
 vahaan bhi yahaan vaala haal he
 It is said that the whole country is supporting the decision
 lekin pakistan main ek shaks he jo is faisle kaa virodh kar rahaa he
 Which is mocked in India, in Pakistan it is funny
 pipuls party of pakistan ke chairman bilaval bhutto ne kaha he, 'meraa faansee kii sazaa main yakeen nahin he
 i oppose the death penalty based on principles
 ' Will we continue to see Kulbhushan's hanging like Sarabjit
 kya ab bhi koi rajanyik rasta bachaa he jisase kulbhushan ko bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Recently US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Helle said that the US is ready to mediate between Pakistan and India
 hamen lagata he ki tanaav bad rahaa he
 India's focus is towards Bangladesh
 jo ki sahi bhi he
 But India has turned its back on Pakistan
 kulbhushan jadhav ko faansee se rokane ke liye kya koi rasta bachaa he yaa phir hamen vahi hasil hone vaala he jo ghanton or maheenon tak lagaataar sarbajit ke kawarej ke baad mila
 Earlier in 1999, Sheikh Shamim was also hanged in Pakistan
 donon par jasusi ke aarope the
 The comments iske jawaab main bharat ne pakistan ke kaidiyon ko reeha karne se inkaar kar diya he
 These prisoners were to be released on Wednesday
 bharat sarkaar ko lagata he ki inhen reeha karne kaa yah upyukt samay nahin he
 Meanwhile, the human rights international body Amnesty International has said that Pakistan's military court system has once again shown how it ridicules international standards
 kulbhushan jadhav ko sunai gai faansee kii sazaa se pataa chalata he ki pakistan kii faujee court kaise behad gopneey tareeke se kaam karte hue aropiyon ke hakon ko chin leti hai
 This court does not give justice but ridicules justice

 Experts in Pakistan are seeing this as a strong message to India
 bharat ke export ummid kar rahe hai ki pakistan ko sadabuddhi aegi
 And they hope that the effort of the diplomats can prevent the punishment
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki bahut hi kam hota he ki kisi jasoos ko sazaa di jaati he
 The United States and Russia exchanged their spies during the Cold War
 bharat pakistan ke sambandhon ke nunatam str ke is daur main kya yah mumkin hoga ki kulbhushan ko insaaf mil sake
 Pakistan's Defense Minister Khwaja Asif has said that Kulbhushan Jadhav has been awarded death sentence according to the law
 yah sazaa dushmano ko chetavanee he
 Imran Khan's party tehreek-e-insaf has supported the death sentence
 vahaan bhi yahaan vaala haal he
 It is said that the whole country is supporting the decision
 lekin pakistan main ek shaks he jo is faisle kaa virodh kar rahaa he
 Which is mocked in India, in Pakistan it is funny
 pipuls party of pakistan ke chairman bilaval bhutto ne kaha he, 'meraa faansee kii sazaa main yakeen nahin he
 i oppose the death penalty based on principles
 ' Will we continue to see Kulbhushan's hanging like Sarabjit
 kya ab bhi koi rajanyik rasta bachaa he jisase kulbhushan ko bachaaya ja saktaa he
 Recently US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Helle said that the US is ready to mediate between Pakistan and India
 hamen lagata he ki tanaav bad rahaa he
 India's focus is towards Bangladesh
 jo ki sahi bhi he
 But India has turned its back on Pakistan
 kulbhushan jadhav ko faansee se rokane ke liye kya koi rasta bachaa he yaa phir hamen vahi hasil hone vaala he jo ghanton or maheenon tak lagaataar sarbajit ke kawarej ke baad mila
 Earlier in 1999, Sheikh Shamim was also hanged in Pakistan
 donon par jasusi ke aarope the
 The comments iske jawaab main bharat ne pakistan ke kaidiyon ko reeha karne se inkaar kar diya he
 These prisoners were to be released on Wednesday
 bharat sarkaar ko lagata he ki inhen reeha karne kaa yah upyukt samay nahin he
 Meanwhile, the human rights international body Amnesty International has said that Pakistan's military court system has once again shown how it ridicules international standards
 kulbhushan jadhav ko sunai gai faansee kii sazaa se pataa chalata he ki pakistan kii faujee court kaise behad gopneey tareeke se kaam karte hue aropiyon ke hakon ko chin leti hai
 This court does not give justice but ridicules justice
 kya sarbajit kii tarah kulbhushan kii faansee bhi ham dekhte rah jaayenge
 Is there any diplomatic route still left that could save Kulbhushan
 haal hi main sanyukt raashtra main america kii rajdoot nikki hele ne kaha tha ki pakistan or bharat ke bich america madhyasthata karne ko taiyaar he
 We feel that tension is increasing
 bharat kaa focus bangladesh kii taraf he
 Which is also correct
 lekin pakistan se bharat ne munh hi mode liya he
 Is there any way left to stop Kulbhushan Jadhav being hanged or are we going to get what was found after Sarabjit's coverage for hours and months continuously
 isse pehle 1999 main shaikh samim ko bhi pakistan main faansee di gai thi
 Both were accused of espionage
 tippaniyan In response, India has refused to release Pakistani prisoners
 in kaidiyon ko buudhvaar ke din choda janaa tha
 The Government of India feels that this is not an appropriate time to release them
 is bich maanavadhikaron se judi antarrashtriya sanstha emnesti international ne kaha he ki pakistan ke military court system ne ek baar phir dikhaa diya he ki wo kaise antarrashtriya maanakon kii khilli udaata he
 The death sentence awarded to Kulbhushan Jadhav shows how Pakistan's military courts act in a very secretive manner to snatch the rights of the accused
 ye court nyaay nahin detii balki nyaay kaa uphaas udaati he

 The film is produced by Aditya Chopra
 aapako lagata he, aapaki nai film da sang of scorpeons (jiskaa premier 9 agast ko locarno film festival main hua) world cinema main abhootpurv sabit hogi?ye upar se to lav story he lekin ek aadmi or aurat ke bich lav main nnya politics hoti he, usko deal karti he
 Landscape is a very big character in it
 or sound
 When you travel in the desert, you feel the sound
 koun-si jabaan main he yah film?language isaki rajasthani or hindi he
 It has producers outside as well, so it is a basic European production
 ise indian production nahin kah sakate
 But how did the decision to take Iranian actress Gulshifteh Farahani for this Rajasthani-based film come to an end? Gulshifte's story is that i and Anoop (singh, director of the film) were at the Abu Dhabi Festival
 vahaan hamane ek film dekhi maai sweet paper land
 She was playing a hangdrum in it
 maine anup se kaha ki yaar is ladki ko ham laa sakate hai kya? hamen aisa cheharaa chahie tha jo apane aap main landscape ho or jisamen mujic kii sensibility ho
 The film is based on the musician and he is the singer in it
 anup ne baat kii
 For the Iranian girl speaking Rajasthani, doing all this was a challenge
 usne chalange liya
 He did an amazing job
 chalange kii jahaan tak baat he to haal hi main aap mark tertlatob kii pazal neuyork main shoot karke aae hai
 What was the challenge for you in that? It has amazing simple writing
 or us primplicity main itani chijen chuphi hui hai ki aapako usamen duguni mehnat kerani padati he
 There are so many shades, so many colors in that simplicity, it takes time for you to reach it
 dekh ke kai baar lag jaataa hoga ki yaar isamen to kuch laga hi nahin
 It takes more effort
 pichley dinon bahubali2 ke tufaan main bhi aapaki hindi medium ne tikkar morcha thama
 He was not afraid of landing the film in his case? We had trouble in coming ahead of Bahubali
 relies ek haftaa sarkani padi thi kyonki theatre hi nahin the
 And she (bahubali 2) was also doing business of 5-5, 6-6 crores on weekdays
 to ek haftaa aage badhaayaa
 Despite that, we were not getting even thousand theaters
 lekin hamane film ko paanch din pehle dikhaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 i remember so far, the discussion was going on after a screening that man this Bahubali is not stopping at all
 lekin kuch jarnlists kaa maananaa tha ki ye film apane content kii vajah se bahaav ko thodaa change karegi
 Content with Entertainment
 saalon se meri koshish rahi he menstream commercial cinema ko rediphine karne kii
 Standing and crossing the Hindi medium with Bahubali 2, it is a sign in itself that people want content, want entertainment in entertainment
 hindi filmon main audiens kaa footfal kam ho rahaa he
 People are not relaying to the subject
 kahani sunaane kaa general approach hota he
 The footfall is going towards Hollywood, which has already looted the industries of many countries
 ek taraf ham itane sankeern hote ja rahe hai, sensor board ajeeb sharten rakh de rahaa he
 Opened its doors on the other side (for Hollywood films)
 cap kyon nahin he? or ek bahut bada audiyans shift ho rahaa he netflix kii taraf
 Revenue has increased due to its arrival
 us par filmein do hafte baad aa ja rahi hai
 People will be watching that on Netflix
 aapane idhar kai videshi abhinetriyon ke saath kaam kiya he
 What is your formula for better interaction with them? i think, there is an untold understanding of actors from all over the world
 ek hi tarika hota he unka kaam karne kaa
 There is no need to adjust anything in it
 kisi ke fahrren hone se uski acting fahrren nahin ho jaati
 Acting is universal
 desh kii simaaen acting kii vidya ko vibhajit nahin kar saktin
 You had to wait three years for the release of Pansingh Tomar and The Song of Scorpions is also coming after a year and a half
 scorpeons kaa post production itnaa hi lanbaa pland tha
 It is a French way to take a year of editing after a shoot
 isamen dile bilkul bhi nahin he
 i think, Pansingh is such a film, which despite being of such merit, had to wait so much
 kai baar studio ko confidence nahin hota
 That is why only after that i thought that one should interfere as a producer
 pichley dinon majahabi kattarta par aapke bolne se kuch log bhadak gaye the
 Now what about that episode? i think, there is no platform to talk, no place
 aapaki baat ko kitna tod-marod karke uskaa ek tamaasha ban jayega, uski koi guarantee nahin he
 It makes you realize that the way the media of this time is shaping people's thinking
 jarnalism kii paribhaashaayen badal gai hai
 Now people are speaking openly that we have our own view, we will tell them
 menstream media propeganda banataa ja rahaa he, jo real log hai, sahi reporting karnaa chaah rahe hai, ve internet kii vajah se apana plateform dhund paa rahe hai
 Unless there is a right kind of critiqueism in democracy, that democracy cannot flourish, it can never be a protective democracy
 in dinon chaaron ore rashtrawaad kii aandhi he
 As an actor, what do these developments make you think? Now the actor is being told that you are an actor and remain an actor
 apane vichaar-vimarsh kii jarurat nahin he
 He is told that you will say anything that does not suit us, then we will collapse your business
 theatre par hamale karenge
 Never bump into face to face with any of such people? i never fall into this discussion
 kai maheene hue, maine to tivi dekhnaa chhod diya he or main bahut sukun main hum
 There is a kind of noise in it
 aisa lagata he jaise ki aap kuch kar rahe hon, ekchuali aap kuch nahin kar rahe
 Your brain is being washed away
 ek bahut hi disterbing nwaise he
 In my bookshelf you will see, there is a slot which was for TV, till today TV has not come
 tivi dekhne kii bajaae aap apane vichaar khud banaaen, wo aapke jinda hone kii nishaani he
 An actor always wishes that "what i say should be the thing of the times"
 ab aap us koshish main aksar kaamyaab ho rahe hai, ise kis tarah se dekhte hai?ek actor kii jimmedaari vahi he ki wo kis tarah ke khwab dikhvaata he
 What character i played beautifully, it is not his, the thing is what the audience feels about me after seeing my character
 mere liye ye jaruri he ki main logon ko khud se unka saamana karaun
 Do you believe in spiritual power? Do you think that there is "someone who clings to the winds"? Yes
 mujhe ye bhi lagata he ki har aadmi ko apana dharm discover karnaa chahie
 When do i meet myself? Basic training of an actor is that you start studying yourself
 jab tak aapmen wo najar paidaa nahin hoti ki aap apane ko, jamaane ko dekh paaen tab tak actor ke paas kehane ko kuch hota hi nahin
 Even then it will end in a few films
 methd acting main aapkaa yakeen he?yah galat prachlan he
 Every actor has to find his method
 koi bhi aisa methd nahin bana he jo do actor par ek saath lagu ho
 You can get rid of it in the long run
 hamen iskaa bhulaava tha ki drama skool main jaaenge or wo hamen drama sikhaa degaa
 It seemed that man had been one and a half years, now he should be acting
 hamaari soch us tarah kii bana di gai he ki aap ye karenge or ye mil jayega
 But this learning only comes when you search inside it
 aapaki soch, sharir or aawaaj aapke tuls hote hai
 It is also not that this tool started using Khatak
 usko istemaal karne main riyaj lagata he
 i always do not like the performance of the actor as long as the craft is seen
 isi tarah kahani bhi jab apana cracrat chupa leti he, tabhi chakit karti he
 It is very important for me to find the character of a character
 har actor kii jarurat nahin he sur
 There may be another way for that
 ye meraa methd he, mujhe sur chahie
 Samadhi, ecstasy, nonsense, ever realized it? It is a private thing
 bataane se uski energy visarjeet hoti he

 That too at a time when Team India needed wickets to make a comeback in the match
 dharmashala vanade main team india 112 ranon ke apane maamuli score kaa bachaav karne utari thi, lekin bumraah kii ek puraani aadat ne sab par pani pher diya or vah phens ke liye ek baar phir 'vilan' sabit hue
 In fact, Bumrah, who came to bowl the sixth over of the Sri Lankan innings, caught Upul Tharanga at the hands of Dinesh Karthik off the fifth ball, but that ball came out no ball and Tharanga got a life
 us samay tharanga ne sirf 11 ran banaae the or unka wicket match kaa rukh palat saktaa tha, lekin unhone 49 ran banaakar team india ko match se baahar kar diya
 a 'no ball' of Bumrah, who had a 111-run loss to Team India, was also reminded of the Champions Trophy on Ashwin by Bumrah who had earlier bowled a ball in the final of Champions Trophy played against Pakistan on 18 June 2017
 jis par pakistani ballebaaj fakhar jamaa out ho gaye the
 However, the umpire called the ball a no ball and Fakhar was out

 After this, Fakhar Zaman also hit the first century of his ODI career against Team India
 jiske kaaran team india ko final main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Bumrah, who made an embarrassing record in odis on January 23, 2016, has so far put 16 no balls in his career
 duniya ke kisi bhi gendbaaj ne abhi tak itane kam samay main 16 no ball nahin phenki he
 Ireland bowler Peter Chase is the number two bowler after Bumrah
 peter chej ne ab tak 12 no ball phenki hai
 After Bumrah's displeasure, the 'no ball' hoarding will be removed, Jaipur Police and India lost the match, let us know that the Sri Lankan team took a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series after defeating India by 7 wickets in Dharamsala ODI

 unhone pehle ek lekh ke jariye phir media ke saamne girti arthvyavastha par sawaal uthaae the or vittamantri arun jetali par nishaanaa saadhaa tha
 Sinha termed the ban on demonetisation and a hasty move to GST

 PM told his opponents, surgery, know who is surgery 2

 rahul ne kaha ki agar piem modi se kaam nahin ho rahaa he to vah hamen sarkaar chalaane ko de den
 We will give employment to people in 6 months
 Steps being taken by the Government of India will place India in a new league of unprecedented development and transformation

 chidambaram pichley kuch dinon se arthvyavastha ke mudde par modi sarkaar par lagaataar nishaanaa saadh rahe hai
 On the article of Union Minister Jayant Sinha, he had tweeted that Jayant Sinha should know that administrative changes are not organizational reforms
 agar jayant sinha sahi hai, to pichhali paanch timahi ke dauraan jidipi main lagaataar giravat kyon ai he
 If Jayant Sinha is right, then why has there not been an increase in private investment
 agar jayant sinha sahi hai to industry kii credit growth negative kyon he?5
 Manmohan Singh: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had given a statement after the decision of demonetisation that this would reduce GDP by 2 percent
 or hua bhi vaisaa hi
 On this, PM Modi retorted that i know the economy less, yet the GDP is fine during my tenure, but during the tenure of those who knew the economy went down about 8 times

 ’’ Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, while targeting the RJD, said that he defends those who attacked the Chief Minister and his heart goes out when security is beefed up to protect the head of state from violent elements
 unhone kaha ki ek taraf argedy-samarthakon ke khataal se sharaab baraamad hoti he, to duusari taraf unke netaa sharabbandi rokane main sarkaar ko vifal sabit karne kii koshish karte hai
 He taunted the RJD by tweeting and said that the liquor-sand mafia funding is showing the duplicity of those doing politics
 ve mukhyamantri par hamalaa karne waalon kaa bachaav karte hai or jab hinsak tatwon se rajya ke mukhiya kii raksha ke liye suraksha badhaayi jaati he, tab unka kalejaa fatataa he
 On the one hand, liquor is recovered from the rage of RJD supporters, on the other hand their leaders prove that the government failed to stop the ban

 Saif shared the news of Kareena's pregnancy in July last year and the child has been in the news since then
 saf or karina ne bachche kaa naam taimur rakhaa, lekin shaayad unhen andaja nahin tha ki bachche ke naam ke liye unhen logon kii aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padegaa
 There was a lot of debate on the name of the child on social media
 saf soshal media par active nahin rahete, controvarsij par bhi zyaadaatar chup hi rahete hai lekin taimur ali khan pataudi ke naam par hui controvarsi par saf ne antat apni chuppi tod di he
 The comments saf ne mumbai mirar se kaha, "jahaan tak meraa maananaa he sitaron ko kaaphi privillage miltaa he or hamaara desh vichaardhaara ke maamle main kaaphi balanced he
 People talk of being fascist and right wing and we all fear this
 lekin sach yah he ki taimur ko lekar anaavashyak drama khadaa kiya gaya
 i did not feel the need to say anything in this matter because many people had given their views on this issue intelligently
 kai log the jinhone mere faisle kaa saath diya or mujhe mahasoos karaayaa ki apane bete kaa naam apni marji se rakhane main koi buraai nahin he
 " bete kaa naam taimur rakhane ke peeche saf kii manshaa kisi ko takalif pahunchane kii bilkul nahin thi
 He told Mumbai Mirror, 'I and my wife liked the name and its meaning a lot, i know the Turkish invader Timur very well
 mere bete kaa naam taimur he, jo ek aitihaasik percian shabd he jiskaa arth loha hota he
 'though he also jokingly said that perhaps he had to give a disclaimer with the son's name as he does in films,' it would be a coincidence to match any living or dead person
 ' Saif told Mumbai Mirror, "as far as i believe stars get a lot of privileges and our country is very balanced in terms of ideology
 log phacist or rhite wing hone kii baat karte hai or ham sabko is baat kaa dar he
 But the truth is that unnecessary drama was created about Timur
 mujhe is maamle main kuch bhi kehane kii jarurat mahasoos nahin hui kyonki kai logon ne is mudde par samajhadaari se apni baat rakhi thi
 There were many people who supported my decision and made me feel that there is nothing wrong in naming my son of his own free will
 " Saif had absolutely no intention of hurting anyone after naming his son Timur
 unhone mumbai mirar ko bataaya, 'mujhe or meri patni yah naam or iskaa matlab kaaphi pasand aayaa, main turkish akramanakari taimur ke bare main achche se jaanata hum
 My son's name is Timur, a historical Persian word meaning iron
 ' haalanki unhone mazaakia lahaze main yah bhi kaha ki shaayad bete ke naam ke saath unhen ek disclemur bhi de dena tha jaise filmon main dete hai, 'iskaa kisi bhi jivit yaa mrit vyakti se mail khaanaa maatra ek sanyog mana jayega
 ' bete kaa naam taimur rakhane ke peeche saf kii manshaa kisi ko takalif pahunchane kii bilkul nahin thi

 The common belief is that due to the working of the mother, she is unable to give more time to the children and they are not taken care of properly, but the opinion of sociologists is somewhat different from this
 unka maananaa he ki aaj ke daur main maa kaa kaamkaaji hona bacchon kii behatar parvarish or acchhee shiksha main madadgaar sabit hota he
 Marital life, ie heaven on earth
 What is there in 'kamasutra'? 
 
 centre for soshal research main nideshak ranjana kumari ne kaha ki aajkal mahilaayein ek ore maa kii bhoomika nibhaati hai or duusari ore offis bhi sambhalati hai
 The working of the mother is somewhere helpful in raising the child well
 unhone kaha, ‘‘aaj kii maa ke kaamkaaji hone ke peeche kai kaaran hai
 The economic needs of families have increased
 shiksha, swasthya or anya chizon par kharchaa itnaa bad gaya he, to kaam karnaa mahila kii jarurat ban gaya he

 "the burden of work on 'relations' in China," Suresh s Jodhak, Professor of Sociology at JNU, said that the benefits of working women are for the children and the family, in fact in most cases they work for them only
 unhone kaha, ‘‘mahilaon ke kaam karne ke kai kaaran hai
 One, the educated woman of today wants her identity and is very conscious of her career which cannot be called wrong from any perspective
 doosraa iske peeche maujuud aarthik kaarnon ko bhi nakaara nahin ja saktaa
 Middle and lower class women work for economic reasons, while upper class women for their separate identity
 ’’ professor jodhak ne kaha, ‘‘maa kaa kaamkaaji hona bacchon kii acchhee parvarish ke liye behatar hi he
 This gives them education, better facilities etc
 in good schools and it is not that women who work do not love their children, they work for them only
 ’’ranjana ne kaha, ‘‘mahilaon ke kaamkaaji hone kaa ek sakaaratmak pahalu yah bhi he ki isse ve aarthik rup se aatmanirbhar banatin he or unke khilaaf gharelu hinsa ke maamalon main kami dekhne ko milti he

 On May 26, when Malwa model Santanarendra Modi was swearing in as Prime Minister, 46-year-old Uday Singh Deshmukh (bhyuji Maharaj) was also brought among his 4,000 VIP guests
 aam taur par baba log kisi math-mandir yaa shrriddhalu ke ghar tikte hai, lekin bhayyuji dakshin dilli ke ambesder hotel main tehre or kuch chuninda logon se mulaakaat ke baad agle din indore laut gaye
 This time Delhi did not pay much attention to this person, but when he last came to break the fast of Anna Hazare at Ramlila Maidan in 2011, everyone's eyes were on him
 yahi nahin, us samay jedy (you) adhyaksh sharad yadav ne loksabhaa main jab anna andolan par apni bhadaas nikaali to bhayyuji ko bhi khub lapeta tha
 At that time people saw for the first time a man who looked like a white-spotted, high-spirited hero as a monk
 yah bhartiya aadhyatmik jagat kaa bilkul nayaa kalevar tha
 Maratha, accomplished in fencing and horse riding, tried to persuade Anna at the call of a minister of the then UPA government
 or ab ve jis tarah se gujarat main 'sant nagari’ bana rahe hai, usase lagata he ki nai sarkaar main is nae daur ke 'maharaj’ kii puch parakh badaae ja rahi he
 The Sant Nagri project was announced by Narendra Modi on 28 January 2011
 is pariyojna main bharat ke sabhi dharmon ke 2,700 se zyada sant-mahatmaon kii murtiyon or itihaas sanjoya jayega, taaki nai peedi bharat kii aadhyatmik viraasat se rou-ba-rou ho sake
 In his meeting in Indore adorned with the image of Bal Shivaji standing by holding the finger of mother Jijabai and the beautiful deities of Lord Ganesha, the science graduate said about the 'sant Nagari', "here the idols and views of the gurus of all religions of India are quoted Will be done
 ” darasal unhone gujarat ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri narendra modi ko sant nagari kaa prastaav bheja tha, jise unhone hathonhaath sweekaar kar liya
 In the changed political environment of the country, such projects can redefine political relations along with religion
 yah baat bhi dhyaan dene kii he ki 2011 main modi jab ahmedabad main sadbhaavna upwas par baithe the—yah upwas us samay vivaad main aa gaya tha jab modi ne muslim topi pahanane se manaa kar diya tha—us vakt duusare santon ke saath bhayyuji bhi vahaan maujuud the
 And he was among those who favored Modi citing the development of Gujarat
 baharhaal, apane ashram main lage chitra main bharat mata ke haath main hal thamane vaala sant bade chaav se bataata he ki kaise usne maharashtra main pardi samaaj kii mahilaon ko veshyavriti se nikaalane ke liye kaam kiya he or kaise unka 'shri sadguru dutt dharmik evam parmaarthik trust’ ab tak 7,709 kanyaon kaa vivaah kara chukaa he
 He is a spiritual master who has modeled for Siyaram Suiting, who does not avoid expensive cars, but is willing to count the amount of money in the trust account
 jab aap unase dharmik kaaryon ke bare main poochhate hai to ve saamaajik kaaryon kaa byora dete hai
 As they will tell with great passion that they have rebuilt hundreds of ponds in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra
 deshbhar main unhone 19
 Has planted 39 lakh saplings and to arouse people's trust in democracy, their trust has so far distributed 1
5 lakh copies of the constitution
 darasal, unka maananaa he ki aadhyatm se jude logon kii jimmedaari samaaj ke prati baaki logon se kahin zyada he or dharm se jude log agar apane prabhaav kaa sahi istemaal karen to samaaj ke liye zyada kaam kar sakate hai
 They are embodying the image of a new type of karmayogi
 ve vivaahit hai
 They have a daughter
 or ve aam grihasth kii tarah isi 2 may ko apane pitaaji ke nidhan se pehle tak mata-pita ke saath ghar main rah rahe the
 According to them, they travel several hundred kilometers every day, so that they keep an eye on the social work they are doing
 ve fasebuk, twitor par sakriy hai or apana blog bhi chalaate hai
 The topics of his blog can range from religion, social work to schizophrenia (a type of mental illness)
 sadhu-mahatmaon kii puraatan style kii bajaae ve aakarshak pahanaave or nai jabaan ko tarjeeh dete hai
 Instead of giving blessings to Mahatmas, they want to create a definition of a volunteer type of monk who wants to work on his own instead of blessing a person capable of doing work
 shaayad isiilie pratibha patil, narendra modi, nitin gadakari, smriti irani, shivaraj singh chouhan, raman singh, uddhav thakare, prithviraj chouhan jaise bahut se netaaon ke saath unki tasviren aapako dekhne ko mil jaaengi
 Earlier it seemed that the Congress leaders are closer to them, but if we examine the BJP leaders who are related to them, then the same thing can be seen
 uddhav thakare ko bahut acha netaa maanane vaale bhayyuji narendra modi kii is baat ke kaayal hai ki modi achche prastaavon ko badi teji se pahchaan lete hai or un par kaam karte hai
 Despite these political connections, they believe that governments cannot do much
 samaaj uddhaar kaa kaam samaaj ko hi karnaa hoga
 And then putting your big eyes in your eyes deeply, question both the society and the government, "why should a black deer hunter get a Padma Shri?" Those who are Rs 500
 film dekhne par kharch kar sakate hai, unhen mahangaai kaa ronaa rone kaa kya haq he? samaaj agar galat logon ko apana adarsh banayega to khud bhi galat disha main jayega
 "so can you come into politics too? The simple answer to this question is, "never
" ” to kya baba ramdev kii tarah kii prakarantar raajnneeti karenge? is par bhi miltaa-julata jawaab, ''kisi se tulana karnaa uchit nahin he
 "but they definitely say that work has to be done in this society, so everyone's cooperation will have to be taken
 netaa or raajnneeti se parhez karne kaa koi tuk nahin he
 Now you have to decide whether with this cooperation you will build your big monastery or spend it on the public
