 More than 100 people with similar faces resembling the sketches were questioned in the city based on the sketches (sketches) of the suspects released by the police shortly after the explosion that killed 15 people
 inhen baad main chhod diya gaya
 These sketches of police artists were so vague that it was difficult to get any help from them
 jab visphot ke asli kirdaar pakade gaye to unki shakl sketch se kahin se bhi nahin milti thi
 The appearance of Satish Kalia, who was arrested in Mumbai on June 11 in connection with the murder of senior journalist Jyotirmoy Dey, did not exactly match the sketches of the police artists
 aisa isliye he kyonki police ke paas sketch banane vaala ek hi kalakaar-26 varshiya naresh corde he, jinhone mumbai, pune, gorakhpur, hyderabad or varanasi main hue tamaam bam visphoton ke saath-saath balaatkaar or hatya ke anginat maamalon se jude aparaadhiyon ke sketch taiyaar kiye hai

 police ummid karti he ki log sketch se milte-julate logon ko dhundhenge lekin aparaadh se jude in scachon kii kahani kii kamyaabi kii daastaan bahut utsahvardhak nahin he

 The details of the offender include his nose, his hairstyle, eyes, eyebrows, chin, cheeks, height, length and other things

 33 baje 'matoshri’ main dil kaa daura padane se shivasena supremeo bal thakare ke nidhan ke kuch minute baad hi unke bhattije raaj thakare ko ek sandesh praapt hua
 It was sent by Ravi Dodha, who was close to Thackeray
 sandesh ke mutabik, thakare ke bete uddhav ne faisla kiya tha ki parivaar ke alaava or kisi ko bhi duusare floor par thakare ke kamare main jane kii ijaajat nahin hogi
 On receiving the message, Raj explained to the visitors that the family planned a big funeral ceremony the next day, so they would not go to the room to pay their last tribute to the departed leader
 iske baad shaam 7
 At 30, Raj went out of Matoshree for an hour
 lautne par unhone dekha ki matoshri par padosiyon kii ek choti-si bheed jamaa he
 Seeing this, he woke up because something else was said to him and something else was happening here
 koun khel rahaa tha yah khel? tamtamaae raaj shivasena netaa divakar raut par chilla pade, ''maala khote kaa padataa?” (aap mujhe jhootha sabit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai?) maamla darasal kuch or tha
 Thackeray's neighbors who had gathered on Matoshree were seeking permission to enter his room
 uddhav ne unhen matoshri aane se nahin roka tha, bas thakare ke kamare main pravesh par pabandi lagaai thi
 Raj did not know what Uddhav had spoken to the neighbors, so he lashed out at Shiv Sena leaders
 samvadaheenata kii isse behatar misaal nahin mil sakati
 Misconceptions and mistrust among the Thackeray brothers have long persisted, separating them
 saat saal baad shivasena ke samarthak or raaj ke netritv vaali maharashtra navnirmaan sena (emenes) ke kaaryakarta donon chachere bhaaiyon ko ab saath kaam karte dekhnaa chaahate hai
 But misinformation and cheap statements have been poisoned in the winds
 donon ke bich kii daraaren sabake saamne hai
 The next day, on November 18, Raj did not shoulder Bal Thackeray's bier
 atakalein garm hai ki raaj se thakare kaa shav le jane vaale trek par chalane kii bajaae antim yatra main paidal aane ko kaha gaya tha jabaki uddhav us trek par savaar the
 Realizing the embarrassment, Raj left the final journey midway and arrived straight to Shivaji Park a few minutes before the truck reached the crematorium
 apane sahyogiyon ko unhone bataaya, ''mujhe sir dard ho rahaa tha
 "but what was the reality is revealed by the statement of an officer of the Crime Branch of Mumbai Police, who told that the police had refused Raj to participate in the last visit
" raaj 2005 main shivasena se alag ho chuke the
 Had he been with Thackeray's corpse in the truck, it would have been possible for the restless and excited 30 lakh Shiv Sena supporters to create a furore to see Thackeray's last glimpse
 ek sawaal jo akasar poocha jaataa rahaa he, jise bal thakare kii mrityu ne ek baar phir jinda kar diya he: kya 52 varshiya uddhav or 44 varshiya raaj thakare phir saath aaenge? shivasena ke samarthak or emenes ke sadsy maanate hai ki vyapak hiton ke liye unhen saath aana hi chahie: vyapak hit yani congress-ensipi gathjod ko satta se baahar karnaa
 It is different that both brothers are in no hurry
 thakare ke aakhri dinon main raaj har agle din matoshri jate rahe, haalanki us dauraan unhone uddhav or unke parivaar se koi baatcheet nahin kii
 He would either sit next to the ailing Thackeray or be found in his Mercedes e class vehicle parked behind Matoshree
 unke kareebi sahyogiyon kaa kahana he ki uddhav ke parivaar ne unke saath thik bartaav nahin kiya tha
 Supporters say that when they went to Matoshree, they were not even asked for a cup of tea
 magar uddhav ke ek samarthak in aaropon ko sire se khaarij karte hai
 He says, "uddhav grabbed Raj's hand and took him to the pyre before offering fire to Bal Thackeray
 unke man main agar koi galat bhaavana hoti to ve raaj ko antim kriya se dur hi rakhte
 According to MNS MLA Nitin Sardesai, he has no idea what was going on between the two brothers
 ve kehete hai, ''aakhri ke chaar din main raaj ke saath matoshri gaya tha
 Whenever both of them used to sit next to Balasaheb, i would not be there
 ”shivasena ke samarthakon kii nichali qatari raaj ko sweekaar karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 These people believe that Raj had ignored Bal Thackeray's emotional appeal before the 2009 assembly elections
 thakare ne us vakt kaha tha, ''mere daravaaje hameshaa khule hai
 The decision is for Raj
 ” andheri se shivasena ke dipti jonal chif jitendra janaavle kehete hai, ''yadi ek hone ke baad ham satta main aa bhi gaye, to uskaa sukh lene ke liye sahib ab hamaare bich nahin honge
 Raj could not make him happy when he won
 ham unhen kabhi sweekaar nahin kar sakate
 "whenever Raj is told to be Thackeray's copycat, Jeetendra is irritated by this," Saheb to the real Sholay thé (1975 hit film), Raj to Ramgarh's Sholay (his 1991 copy) 
 ” andheri se hi emenes ke ek netaa maanate hai ki shivasena se haath milaane main badi vyaavhaarik dikkatein hai
 In his words, "both parties have their own organizational structure
 donon ke vilay se araajaktaa paidaa hone ke alaava or kuch nahin hoga
 "shiv Sena has around 10 lakh members in Maharashtra while MNS has three lakh members
 sambandh bahaali kii kisi bhi gunjaaish se saradesai inkaar karte hai
 He says, "in this case only Raj and Uddhav can take a decision
 ” ve is raajnneeti ko aasaan aankadon se samajhaate hai: emenes bad rahi he kyonki pichley vidhansabha chunaav main usne 13 siton par jeet hasil kii thi jabaki 2009 ke loksabhaa chunaav main uske nau pratyaashiyon ko 1 lakh se zyada vot pade the
 However none of them could win
 mumbai or pune kii mahanagarapalika main emenes kii badi maujuudagi he
 It is in power in Nashik
 saradesai kehete hai, ''ham kisi jaldbaaji main nahin hai
 "shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi says," Even staunch enemies come together in politics, but i can only say that Raj and Uddhav will not come together in the near future
 ”magar rajnatik majaburiyaan jo bhi hon, paariwarik masale to alag hi hote hai
 a close acquaintance of the Thackeray family says, "the wives of the two brothers will not let them come together
" ” ek sutara ke mutabik, uddhav kii mahatvakankshi patni rashmi or raaj kii raajnneeti se dur rahane vaali lekin dabang patni sharmila donon hi yah chahengi ki unke pati apni rajnatik raah khud gadhen
 Uddhav's supporters recall how his wife Sharmila once duped him at Matoshree repeatedly at Raj's house
 apane nidhan ke ghante bhar pehle bal thakare uddhav ke chote bete tejas (18) ko dekhnaa chaahate the
 When Tejas entered the room, Thackeray held his hand and chinned his back
 ve bol nahin paa rahe the, lekin kya peeth thokkar ve koi sandesh dena chaah rahe the? gauratlab he ki 18 aktubar ko uddhav ne apane bade bete aditya (23) ko shivaji park main hui ek raily main shivasena kii yuva ikai yuva sena kaa pramukh ghoshit kiya tha
 Bal Thackeray's departure is a litmus test for Uddhav's leadership
 uddhav ke ek rajnatik pratidwandvi kaa maananaa he ki shivasena ke 45 saal se upar ke kaaryakartaaon kii khamosh nazren bhavishya kii ghatnaon par bani rahengi, uske baad hi ve tay karenge ki sena main bane rahanaa he yaa use chhodkar nikal janaa he
 On the other hand, activists for 25 years have chosen their leader: they want a miraculous rule, not a benign and introverted Uddhav
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki sena ko thakare kii chamatkaari raajnneeti kii kami akharegi
 His relationships with leaders like Sharad Pawar, LK Advani and Pranab Mukherjee were excellent
 jab pranab mukherjee ko congress kii ore se raashtrapati pad kaa ummidavaar ghoshit kiya gaya, to bal thakare ne endie kaa ghatak hone ke baavjood unka samarthan kiya
 Uddhav does not enjoy such popularity among every party
 isse bhi bura yah he ki 1986 se shivasena kaa lagaataar saath de rahi bijepi ke adhyaksh nitin gadakari se unke rishte bahut achche nahin hai
 In contrast, Gadkari has a good relationship with Raj
 dhyaan rahe ki 2009 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan ek saakshaatkaar main raaj ne gadakari ko maharashtra ke mukhyamantri pad kaa yogya ummidavaar tehraaya tha
 Senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde is keen on joining Raj
 party ne aktubar main ghoshnaa kii thi ki 2014 kaa vidhansabha chunaav munde ke netritv main hi ladaa jayega
 Sena 's grip on Maharashtra is getting loosened
 usne 2009 main vidhansabha kii 288 main se sirf 45 siten jiti thim
 Barring Mumbai and Thane, he is not in power in any major municipality
 is saal farvari main hue sthaneey nikaayon ke chunaav main ensipi or congress ke baad shivasena tisare number par rahi thi
 If Munde felt that it was beneficial to play bets on MNS, he would not hesitate to shore up the Shiv Sena

 It is a matter of regret that he behaved this way during the meeting
 sushamaa ne kaha ki pakistan ne is mulaakaat ko propaganda banaaya
 Jadhav's mother wears only saris, her clothes were also changed
 media ko maa or patni ke najadik aane diya gaya, jo hamaari sharton ke khilaaf tha
 After returning from the meeting, the mother-wife said that Kulbhushan is under pressure
 unke kaid karne waalon ne jo unhen bolne ke liye kaha tha jadhav sirf vahi bol rahe the
 Pakistan can do some mischief with Jadhav's mother-wife shoes
 is meeting main sirf maanavadhikaar ke niyamon kaa ulanghan hi hua he
 Opposition supported the government
 Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad supported the statement of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj
 unhone kaha ki jadhav par jo bhi aarope lagaae gaye hai, wo jhuthe or farji hai
 There is no democracy in Pakistan, we know Pakistan well
 jadhav kii maa-patni ke saath jo bhi hua he, wo apmaan puraa desh kaa he
 Apart from Congress, all other parties also supported the government's statement

 Some reporters who came to Sirsa to take stock of the situation around the Dera headquarters after the Dera chief was convicted in a rape case by a CBI court were also given such plastic coins in place of the Indian currency

 Jagdeep Rana and Rajan Kumar Madan, accused in the Delhi High Court for committing an uproar in the Assembly, have not received interim relief at present
 donon aam aadmi party ke netaa he or donon par pichley maheene vidhansabha ke vishesh satr ke dauraan hangaamaa karte hue sadan main parchaa phenkane kaa aarope he
 Both these leaders have been sent to jail by the assembly speaker for one month each

 The court asked the petitioner's counsel the question whether you are challenging the Speaker's authority or heard his sentence for one month
 court ne yachikakarta ke vakil ko yachika main kuch badlaav karke laane ko kaha he or is par dobaaraa sunwaayee kal court dobaaraa karegaa
 At the same time, during the hearing of the case, the counsel appearing for the Delhi government opposed the plea of the petitioner and questioned that the petitioners cannot question the rights of the speaker
 to is par hoicourt ne maamle kii sunwaayee karte hue yachikakarta se poocha ki unke donon muvakkil kya bhagat singh bananaa chaahate the
 We live in independent India today
 lihaaja wo saaf karen ki kya spikar kii di gai sajaa ko wo court main chunauti de rahe he yaa nahin
 The petitioner told the court that he had been arrested unlawfully and it was a case of habeus corpus (captive directive), but the court told the petitioner that this case was not by habeus corpus but given by law to the Speaker of the Assembly Arrested under Gaya Powers
 agar yachikakarta vidhansabha spikar ko di gai shaktiyon ko chunauti dena chahta he, to kuch badlaavon ke saath yachika dobaaraa daayar karen
 In such a situation, it will be interesting to see what attitude the Delhi High Court takes regarding the authority of the Speaker of the Delhi Legislative Assembly

 shilpa ne kaha, produsar ne ek choti si baat kaa bavaal bana diya
 First made me sit at home and now even if he wants me to be a part of this show, it will never happen
 shilpa se jab poocha gaya ki aapke sho se baahar hone se producers ko baari nuksaan hua he jisaki bharpai karne ke liye CINTAA ne aapako kaha he? to is parshilpaane kaha, 'kya sirf producers kaa hi nuksaan hota he artist ko nuksaan nahin hota? itane din tak jab main bina kisi kaam ke ghar baithi hum or sirf legal notice ke jawaab de rahi hum to kya meraa nuksaan nahin ho rahaa? is maamle kii vajah se mankapil ke shoko bhi sin nahin kar saki

 Aurangabad, formerly part of Hyderabad, but after independence from the Razakars, it came to the part of Maharashtra
 aurangabad main ise aaj bhi aazaadee diwas ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 My coverage in MP Jalilmaharashtra elections which did not participate in the celebration of independence started with the uproar over the celebration of this Independence Day
 aurangabad ke saansad imtiyaaj jaleel jo AIMIM ke saansad hai is jashn main shaamil nahin hue
 Although he made it clear that he was out of Aurangabad, it is being made an issue here
 aurangabad kaise bana asaddudin ovaisi kii raajnneeti main safal prayogshaala, is baar kya bijepi-shivasena gathbandhan bana paaegaa dabadabaa? meri ground report
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, Imtiaz Jalil of AIMIM had made a dent in the stronghold

 Let's see how Aurangabad became a successful laboratory in the politics of Asaduddin Owaisi
 loksabhaa main AIMIM ko mili thi jeetaloksabhaa chunaav 2019 main AIMIM ke imtiyaaj jaleel ne laga di thi shivasena ke garh main send
 In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, where a massive Modi wave wiped out everyone, how Owaisi in Maharashtra went from 1 to 2 in Parliament due to this Aurangabad
 AIMIM pichley paanch saal se maharashtra kii raajnneeti main lagaataar pair pasaar rahi he
 Apart from two party mps, there are three mlas in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly and also in the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation
 nagar nigam main number tu AIMIM113 siton vaali aurangabad nagar nigam main bijepi-shivasena ne apana kabja barkaraar rakhaa, lekin AIMIM duusare number par rahi
 AIMIM fielded 54 candidates, winning 26 of them
 congress yahaan par simat kar 10 or NCP 3 par aa gai
 Aurangabad has also been the land of Ambedkar's Dalit movements
 kareeb 4000 vot se hi imtiyaaj ne loksabhaa chunaav jeeta tha
 So there was a big reason the BJP Shiv Sena could not get an alliance in the last election
 aurangabad main muslim dalit gathbandhan kar paanaa or is vot sameekaran ko saadh paanaa ovaisi kii sabase badi kamyaabi bani
 This time the agreement could not be done, according to the 2011 census, now 30 in Aurangabad
 79 fisadi kii muslim aabaadi he
 According to current estimates, there is now about 35 per cent Muslim population, but in the Assembly elections, a challenge from Owaisi is that despite thousands of attempts, Prakash Ambedkar could not be aligned with the underprivileged Agadi Party
 ovaisi bhi jaanate hai ki lagaataar kamjor ho rahi congress party unke liye ek anoothaa raajnneetik mauka paidaa kar rahi he
 Congress, like many other places, is almost absent here
 bollywood kii ek film kaa mashhoor gaanaa he 'dushman naa kare dost ne jo kaam kiya he
 'it fits perfectly with the infighting in the Congress between Maharashtra and Haryana's election heat
 lagaataar do loksabhaa chunaavon main buree tarah pity congress ko jahaan bijepi se ladane ke liye ekajute hokar muqabla karne kii zarurat he vahaan party ke netaa apni dafali apana raag alaap rahe hai
 Why is the struggle going on in Congress? Fresh leaders among Congress leaders have started with the foothold of Rahul Gandhi
 alam yah he ki congress ke hi netaa khuleam kah rahe hai ki ghar ko aag lagi ghar ke hi chiraag se
 In Maharashtra, where the Congress was speaking till five years ago, where the Congress held state power for 15 years, the Congress did not seem to be in a position to challenge the bjp-shiv Sena's invincible-looking alliance in the 2019 election battle
 doing 
 congress kii kamajoriyon ke baavjood is baar maharashtra vidhansabha chunaavon mechasaduddin ovaisi kii party kii chunautibadi he
 There are many reasons for this
 pehla, prakaash ambedkar kii party ke saath gathbandhan nahin ho paanaa
 This can become such a weak link due to which Owaisi's dream of Muslim Dalit equation will remain incomplete
 duusari taraf BJP or shivasena kaa gathbandhan ho janaa ye sunishchit karegaa ki in donon partiyon ke paaramparik vot bank jude rahe or voton kaa bantwaaraa naa ho

 Reacting strongly to Rahul Gandhi comparing Narendra Modi to Hitler, the BJP on Wednesday said that if anyone draws inspiration from Hitler in independent India, it is Indira Gandhi, the grandmother of the Congress vice-president who imposed the Emergency in the country
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa arun jetali ne kaha, 'apatkaal main indira ji kaa har kadam hitler ke shashan se prerit tha
 There is only one basic distinction between the two

 The screenplay of the film is written by Juhi Chaturvedi

 Let us know that Priyanka and Farhan Akhtar are going to work together for the second time

 He said that the police has detained a woman in this case
 aarope he ki bhagwantpur gaanv kii rahane vaali us mahila ne ram singh ko gaanv ke baahar sthit nalakup parisar main sharaab di thi

 ) (except for the headline, this news has not been edited by the NDTV team, it is published directly from the Syndicate feed
 ) At the age of 75, Shibu Soren became the Chief Minister of Jharkhand in political turmoil, but Guruji, who is surrounded by diseases, now wants to leave his Rajpat
 shibu sorain kaa uttaradhikari bhi taiyaar he
 Guruji is now in the process of making Hemant Soren the son known as Super CM
 isi silsile main guruji do mantriyon or hemanth ko lekar bijepi se baatcheet karne dilli aae hai
 Guruji, who has lost the last election from Tamar, has a problem that he will have to reach the assembly within six months to stay on the chief minister's chair, but ill-fated Shibu is unable to decide which seat to contest from
 party baithkon main bhi koi nateeja nahin nikal rahaa
 If JMM mlas are leaving their seats for Guruji, Guruji wants to leave the Chief Minister's chair for Hemant, but it is not so easy

 The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said in its reply on Friday after a notice issued by the Election Commission about Namo TV that it is an advertising platform launched by DTH service providers that does not require government approval

 According to the source, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting told the Election Commission that as per the current rules, it does not require any approval from them to run such advertising platforms

 Ronnie surprised everyone by saying that some players of a team are on his radar, which he suspects he might try fixing during a match in the future
 rauni ne team or khilaadiyon kaa naam to nahin bataaya, lekin itnaa jarur kaha ki jaanch chal rahi he
 The ICC will soon call all the players of this team and apprise them of the danger of fixing
 isse vah khilaadi jin par shaq he ve bhi satark ho jaaenge or shaayad aisi harakat na karen
 Ronnie's statement in India before the World T20 can be interpreted quite a lot
 world cap ko phixing ke is saae se bachaane ke liye isisi ne kuch sakht kadam bhi uthaae hai
 Players will be given a small book, which explains all the rules
 toornament ke dauraan 24 ghante kii helpline bhi khuli rahegi
 The comments phixing kaa yah khatra isliye bhi bada he, kyonki haal main kuch aise cese saamne aae hai, jisane cricket jagat ko hairaan kar diya
 In January 2016, former South African player Ghulam Bodi was banned for 20 years for fixing
 janvari 2016 main hi ajit chandila par bisisiai ne aaajeevan pratibandh lagaaya
 In January 2016, Sri Lanka suspended their fast bowling coach Anusha Samranayake
 phixing par puri tarah se lagaam lagaana mushkil he yah baat isisi ko bhi maaloom he, lekin cricket ko safasuthra rakhane ke liye har mumkin koshish kii ja rahi he

 This danger of fixing is also big because some such cases have come up recently which surprised the cricket world
 janvari 2016 main purv dakshin africa khilaadi gulam bodi par phixing ke chalate 20 saal kii pabandi lagi thi
 In January 2016, BCCI imposed a lifetime ban on Ajit Chandila
 janvari 2016 main srilanka ne apane tej gendbaaji coach anushaa samaranayake ko nilambit kiya
 The ICC also knows that fixing is difficult to completely curb, but every possible effort is being made to keep cricket clean

 The condition of tribals in the country is very bad
 ye baat ek baar phir se saamne ai he
 The government-submitted panel submitted a report on the tribals' plight, but the NDA government has been keeping this report for the last six months and is sitting quietly rather than taking concrete steps
 jane maane samajashastri virginius khakh kii adhyakshata main pichley saal (2013) agast main ek ucch stareey panel banaaya gaya jisane kaha he ki adivasee samudaay ke log shiksha, swasthya, or kuposhan ke maamle main desh main sabase bure haal main hai
 The number of tribals in India is eight to nine percent (about 8
 6 fisad) ke bich he, lekin wo vikaas ke chalaae ja rahe project kii sabase adhik maar jhel rahe hai
 This 400-page report of the Khakha panel is with NDTV India, stating that 40 to 60 percent of the people displaced due to the development project are tribals who are repeatedly driven from their homes and have a rigorous plan to settle them
 Is never made
 20 fisad se bhi kam visthapit logon ko basaane kii koshish kii gai or usamen se adhiktar kaagazon par hi he

 nehru-gandhi kii viraasat vaali desh kii sabase puraani raajnneetik party kii kaman sabase lamb vakt tak sanbhaalane kaa saubhaahgya jis mahila ko naseeb hua, wo naam he sonia gandhi
 The woman who had to bear the sorrow of sacrificing her mother-in-law (indira Gandhi) and husband (rajiv Gandhi) is Sonia Gandhi
 sonia gandhi bharat kii raajnneeti kaa ek aisa naam hai, jise bahari hone ke baad bhi sammaan se sweekaar kiya gaya
 Born on 9 December 1946 in Luciana, a small village in Italy's Vicenza, Sonia's father, Stefino Mayano, was a former fascist soldier
 sonia kaa bachapan italy se kuch dur sthit orbasaano main gujara
 She then moved to England in 1964
 jahaan cambridge vishvavidhyalay main unhone english languej kii padhai kii
 During this time he met former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, who was then studying at Trinity School Cambridge
 is mulaakaat ne hi sonia kii jindagi badal di
 How Soniarajiv Gandhi came into Rajiv's life saw Sonia for the first time in a restaurant
 rajeev gandhi jab cambridge uniwarsity main pard rahe the tab ve vahaan ke greek restaurant main gaye
 At the same time, he saw Sonia Gandhi for the first time and fell in love with her
 sonia gandhi ke pita stiffno mino nahin chaahate the ki unki shaadi rajeev gandhi se ho, unhen donon kii shaadi manjuur nahin thi kyonki wo bharat kii tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi ke bete the
 The two finally got married in 1968, after which Sonia Gandhi returned to India and in 1983 she accepted Indian citizenship
 na chaahakar bhi raajnneeti main aana padaaatmghaatee dhamaake main rajeev gandhi kii hatya ke baad congress ke varisht netaaon ne sonia se puche bina unhen congress kaa adhyaksh banane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Sonia denied it
 pati kii hatya kaa ghaav itnaa gaharaa laga ki unhone yahaan tak kaha ki main apane bacchon ko bheekh maangate dekh luungi, lekin raajnneeti main kadam nahin rakhuungi
 He himself shared the story of his political journey in India Today Conclave
 unhone bataaya tha, 'main nahin chaahati thi ki rajeev raajnneeti main aaen, lekin unhen indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad aana padaa
 Similarly, i also did not want to get into politics, but i also had to come under compulsion
 jab main raajnneeti main ai, tab congress mushkil main thi
 If i did not get into politics, people would call me a coward
 ' bataa den ki sonia gandhi ne 1998 main congress adhyaksh pad kii jimmedaari sanbhali thi

 2009 main bhi wo raibareli se jeetin or 2014 main phir ek baar vah apni seat par jeetne main kaamyaab raheen
 Earlier in 2004, when it came to becoming Prime Minister, Sonia Gandhi put forward Manmohan Singh's name
 iske baad 2009 main bhi unhone upie sarkaar ko manmohan singh kaa netritv diya
 Sonia's opinion on becoming Prime Minister, when she did not become Prime Minister, Sonia Gandhi told that she had confidence in Manmohan Singh to prove herself to be a better Prime Minister
 hindi bhashaa par sonia gandhi kaa kahana he ki shuruyaat main unhen hindi main bolne main dikkat hoti thi, lekin indira gandhi unase hindi main hi baat karne ko kahati thim
 Sonia Gandhi now speaks Hindi correctly
 bataa den ki raajnneeti main kadam rakhane ke baad unke videshi mul kaa mudda uthaaya gaya
 At the same time, his weak Hindi was also made an issue
 philhal, wo congress kii adhyaksh nahin hai
 Sonia Gandhi believes that after leaving the post of the President of the Congress Party, she now has more time
 lihaaja is samay main wo rajeev gandhi se jude puraane dastavejon ko padhane or parivaar kii jimmedaari nibhaane main laga rahi hai

 Devendra Satyarthi: a Travel Name Public Administration Department, Government of India Price: 195 Rs
 lokyatri devendra satyaarthee kii aughad jindagi ko unke paas baithkar najadik se mahasoos kiya he lekhak prakaash manu ne
 This book was prepared after his frequent meetings with Satyarthi
 usee ke kuch ansh pesh hai yahaan:in yatraaon main baar-baar bhukh or fatehali saamne aakar khadi ho jaati
 Many times one would have to sleep hungry under a tree or on a pavement
 bich-bich main mehnat-mazdooree se unhen gurej na tha
 In order to survive those days, Satyarthi worked in Tatanagar, from picking up tin sheets, selling newspapers, tuition, etc
 ajmer main ek press main satyarth prakaash chhapata tha
 While working there, he named himself 'satyarthi' and was discharged from the family name 'batta', which he had been unpleasant since childhood (pp
 35-36)
 satyaarthee ji se shantiniketan or gurudev ke bare main sunanaa sachmuch ek aanandadaayak anubhav tha
 There were moments when he would drown himself completely and in his words a very colorful picture of Gurudev and Santiniketan emerged
 
 
 ''main to ramata jogi tha, ghoomte-ghoomte hi shantiniketan pahunchaa tha
 Satyarthi smilingly caught the tip of the thing and then came in unison and started telling
 ''un dinon shantiniketan kii dur-dur tak kirti fail chuki thi
 One to one great talents were there
 unase milane, baat karne kaa man hota tha, par sabase badhkar to gurudev rabindranath thakur se milane kii laalasaa thi
 Till then, there were small meetings with Gurudev, but there was no open talk
 unke bare main prasiddh tha ki ve kisi se pair nahin chuaate the
 Once i touched his feet by deception and he blessed me with love
 uske baad maine vistaar se unase apane loakgeet sangrah kii charchaa kii to bade gaur se sunate rahe
 Being happy, he said that i too wanted to travel all over the country sitting in a bullock cart and planned to collect 'palli Geet', but that work remained incomplete
 mujhe khushi he ki jo kaam main nahin kar sakaa, vah tum kar rahe ho
 Rabindranath Thakur told him that folk songs in Bengal are called 'palli Geet'
 
 
 shantiniketan main gurudev se to milanaa hota hi tha, acharya hajaari prasad dvivedi, avanindranath thakur, nandlaal basu, ramkinkar tathaa or bhi na jane kitni vibhootiyon se ve vahaan pehle-pahal mili
 
 
 (pages 45–46)
 acharya (hajariprasad) dvivedi se judaa ek dilachasp prasang satyaarthee ji aksar sunaate the
 
 
 Satyarthi went to meet him in Shanti Niketan
 kuch sahitya prasang, kuch ghumkkadi kii charchaa or gapshap hui
 Dwivedi used to ask Satyarthi about his long and continuous journey with great interest
 phir achaanak baton-baton main unhone poocha, ''aajkal kya likh rahe hai?'' us samay satyaarthee ji ke haath main ek rekhachitr tha, 'iravati'
 He gave it to Dwivedi to read
 dvivedi ji ne vah lekh rakh liya
 Satyarthi was to return after two days
 
 
 lekh waapas maanga
 But Dwivedi said with serious face, "you will not get that article now
" '' satyaarthee ji chaunke, ''kyon bhala?'' is par unhone kaha, ''vah to vishwabharati main chap rahaa he
 i then sent it to the press
 aap aaj raat ko ruken to uske hdhuf bhi dekhte jaaie
 '' (page 51)
 agyeya se satyaarthee ji ke rishton kaa graph bada pechida rahaa he
 Once they were together, then distances also came
 man mili bhi, takaraav bhi hua
 But the truth was that Satyarthi used to respect Agnayya a lot and he also respected him a lot (pp
 99-100)
 satyaarthee ji pakistan kii yatra par gaye to bagaiyr ghar waalon ko bataae, maheenon vahiin tik gaye the
 Then Lokmata got Pt
 nehru ko khat likhnaa padaa
 Satyarthi was asked about this
 
 
 ve bataane lage, ''nehru ji ne vah patr pakistan main bharat ke rajdoot ko bhijwaya
 He insisted, the writers of Pakistan also understood, then i cut back the ticket to Delhi

 bhartiya suraksha agenciyaan hameshaa daawa karti rahi hai ki anderworld don daaud ibrahim kaa dehshatgardi se gaharaa naata he

 saamne aayaa sansanikhej videotalha said kaa ek aisa video saamne aayaa he jisamen wo bheed ko daaud ibrahim kaa naam lekar aatankwaad ke liye uksaa rahaa he
 The video was shot on 5 February
 is din ko pakistan main 'kashmir diwas' ke taur par manaaya jaataa he
 In the video, Talha asks supporters whether they want to become doctors, police or judges? The answer to the crowd comes in 'no'
 iske baad talha poochta he ki kya log daaud or burhani vaani jaisaa bananaa chaahate hai to bheed chikhakar 'haa' main jawaab detii he
 Why is the video important? The video has raised the ears of Indian security agencies as this is the first time any Pakistani terrorist organization has directly mentioned Dawood Ibrahim
 daaud 1993 main hue mumbai dhamaakon ke baad karachi main rah rahaa he
 However, the Pakistani government has been denying this
 daaud ke nakli karency, drugs or real estate ke dhandhe main shaamil hone kii baat jagajaahir he
 Indian intelligence agencies believe that a large part of the d-company's money is spent on terrorism funding
 ye video daaud ke khilaaf shikanja kasne main bharat ke liye ahm saboot sabit ho saktaa he
 The Pakistani government put Hafiz Saeed under international pressure after Lashkar took revenge for Cholatramp becoming president

 However, Yeddyurappa later claimed to be in touch with rebel mlas staying at the Mumbai resort

 Lokpal was passed on 18 December 2013
 23 november 2016 aa gaya
 There is no Lokpal
 2011 se lekar 2013 tak dilli se chalane vaale media main jitani bahes lokapal or bhrashtachar ko lekar hui utani kisi duusare mudde ko lekar nahin hui
 There was a lot of debate on the potential of the Lokpal and all the possibilities of corruption being erased
 pehali baar log kisi kanoon or uske dhaanche ko lekar is tarah se bahes karne lage
 In the same way these days there is a house-to-house debate about demonetisation
 sab hua, lekin lokapal nahin aayaa
 The Lokpal has not yet come, which was to root out corruption, demonetisation has come, which is claimed to be a historic step to remove corruption
 aitihaasik to lokapal ko bhi kaha gaya tha
 The Lokpal Act was passed 46 years after it was introduced in the House
 itihaas banakar bhi lokapal kaa vartmaan nahin ban sakaa
 The lesson is that making history does not create the present
 kya ve bhi bhul gaye jo lokapal kii ladaai ladate the
 The Lokpal was mentioned in the uproar of demonetisation, even after the Supreme Court's comment
 lokapal andolan se ek party bani, jisaki dilli main sarkaar he
 The movement separated two people, one of whom is the Minister of State for External Affairs at the Center
 ek puducheri kii leftinent governor hai
 Anna Hazare still holds the post of moral guru
 samay-samay par tivi par avatarit hote rahete hai
 The Lokpal was passed during the UPA in Parliament
 notebandi ko lekar itani ladaai ho rahi he? kya aapane congress ke kisi netaa ko 'lokapal lokapal' karte suna he
 The BJP was also instrumental in getting the Lokpal passed and also took a lot of credit
 loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa ke rup main sushamaa swaraj kaa yaadgaar bhaashan koun bhul saktaa he
 At the moment Sushma ji is in Astpal and we also wish her and you from the audience to get well soon
 aisa nahin he ki maujuuda pradhanmantri modi ne gujarat se lokapal kaa swaagat nahin kiya tha
 On 18 December, he tweeted three
 us vakt lokapal ke samarthan main bolne vaale 125 karod bhartiya kii taraf se bolte the
 Even now the supporters of demonetisation are saying 'whole country whole country'
 lokapal ke samay vaala desh kaise bhul gaya
 How will we not forget the country during the time of demonetisation, how can we claim it
 lokapal kii niyukti ek pahalu he
 What is the structure of the institution called Lokpal has been prepared
 prashanth bhushan kii team ne supreme court main ek yachika daayar kii thi jis par adaalat kii tippanee ai he
 From Lokpal to demonetisation the dream is the same, corruption should be eradicated
 notebandi vaale bhi lokapal ke liye phir se sangharsh kar sakate hai
 The Supreme Court has also said that the Lokpal should not be allowed to become a dead letter
 sarkaar ko iske liye ek dedline tay kerani hogi
 There will be a hearing again on 7 December
 maujuuda loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he or lokapal kii niyukti kii cameti main netaa vipaksh kaa hona zaruri he
 This rule of appointment has to be changed
 2014 ke baad ke sansad ke satron ke ricard kaam karne kii khabaren aati hai
 There are reports of many bills passing
 jiesti jaisaa asambhav sa lagane vaala bill paas ho gaya
 Who is not interested in the appointment of Lokpal? yah raay kab ban gai ki bhrashtachar mitaane main lokapal kaa koi role hi nahin he
 The Lokpal movement also changed the media
 jo tivi channel bhoot pret main lage hue the ve bhrashtachar kii ladaai kaa prasaaran centre ban gaye
 It is here that the period of anchors becoming the Messiah begins
 azaadi part tu laanch kar di gai
 Everyone felt that they are busy arguing for the independence of the country
 jaisaa ab bataaya ja rahaa he ki aap jis takalif se guzar rahe hai wo desh ke liye he
 Common people moved from TV studio to mic
 media ne us bhukh ko ujagar kiya
 Programs to eradicate corruption started getting trps
 lokapal hi wo terning point tha jiske kaaran tivi ke band studio kii deevaaren dhah gayi
 The talk of common people started reaching
 jununee bahes aaj bhi ho rahi he bas kisi ko yaad dilaane kii zarurat he ki aisi hi bahes pehle bhi ho chuki he
 Not much three years ago
 is vakt kii tarah us vakt bhi khub survey ho rahe the
 News channels CNN, IBN and CNBC TV18 conducted an all India survey in association with CSDS
 'hindu' akhbaar ne bhi chapa tha
 The report on this survey appeared in the First Post of 9 August 2011
 survey main shaamil 34 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki lokapal kaa naam suna he
 24 percent people said that they know what the Lokpal is
 padhe-likhe logon main 67 fisadi ne lokapal ke bare main suna tha or 51 pratishat ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki lokapal kya he
 All such channels and newspapers may have conducted such surveys, but the question of the survey at that time seems to be that the question about which Lokpal is such a ruckus, if asked how many people have heard the name and how many people know the meaning of Lokpal
 us survey ke sawaal kaaphi baarik the
 What is your opinion on Lokpal? Do you agree with the government's argument? Do you agree with Anna Hazare's argument? abhi kaha ja rahaa he ki sirf amir bhrasht hai, lekin us vakt ke survey main paanch catagori ke bare main poocha gaya tha ki inamen se koun sabase bhrasht he - sarkaar, nirvaachit pratinidhi, nyaaypalika, bijnesaman, udyogpati, enjio or media
 32 per cent of the people surveyed said that the government is the most corrupt and 43 per cent said that the elected leaders are the most corrupt
 isi tarah ke survey in dinon bhi ho rahe hai
 After demonetization, the main question has become whether you are happy with the decision of the government or not
 survey ke sawaal isi ke aasapaas hai
 At that time, people were joining the survey by considering Lokpal as the savior of corruption, now forgetting it, people have started considering demonetisation as the new liberator
 tab bhi vahi log the, ab bhi yahi log hai
 Can some questions like Lokpal be asked in this way - Do you know how to make black money? kya aap jaanate hai ki nagdi note ke alaava kaala dhan kitne prakaar ke hote hai? Do you know that money is kept in other countries by creating a fake company? kya aap maanate hai ki sirf notebandi se hi kaala dhan mit jayega? At the time of Lokpal it was asked how much you know about it
 notebandi ke samay bhi poocha janaa chahie ki aap kaala dhan ke bare main kya jaanate hai
 Now everyone is asking, are you with the decision of the government? At least the main question is, are you with the government's decision? Action against corruption will not oppose anyone who is involved in corruption
 'dainik jaagran' or 'hindustan' ke survey hai
 The first question of the survey of 'dainik Jagran' of 19 November is that despite the problems caused by this step, are you in favor of it? 86 included in this survey
 1 pratishat logon ne kaha he ki haa hai
 Has the government taken the right step by closing big notes - 84
 8 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki sahi kadam uthaaya he
 The fourth question is whether this will eliminate black money and further stop its path
 iske jawaab main logon kii raay main baari badlaav dikhataa he
 25 percent say they don't agree, 67
 2 fisadi kehete hai ki sahamat hai
 While 84 percent of those who consider the government's move to be good
 8 or 86
 1 percent
 20 november ko hindi akhbaar dainik hindustan main ek survey prakashit hota he
 In Jagran's survey, the percentage of those who show good steps is 85 or more
 hindustan kaa survey bataata he ki pichley das din main notebandi ke samarthak lagaataar kam hue
 On 8 November, 78 per cent of the people in the survey of Hindustan supported
 saat din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghatakar 61
 93 percent
 10 din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghat kar 46 pratishat ho gai
 The Times of India also conducted a c-voter survey on November 22, according to which 80 per cent people said that they do not care about the problems caused by demonetisation
 sara sawaal isi par he ki faisle ke samarthak hai yaa isse hui takalif ko parvaah karte hai yaa nahin
 It was during the Anna movement that Arvind Kejriwal started a referendum on every aspect related to the Lokpal
 2011 main lokapal kaisaa hona chahie ise lekar puraani dilli or model toun main survey kara diya gaya tha
 There was a lot of mockery then that the law was made by the discretion of the Parliament or by such a survey with missed calls
 notebandi ke daur main yahi survey phir se laut aae hai
 The Prime Minister has released an app on which ten questions have been asked about black money
 bhartiya itihaas kaa itnaa bada faisla
 In the same way, it was said about the Lokpal and these surveys raised questions
 us samay kejariwal survey karke dilli ke auto par chipka dete the
 Those surveys used to be mocked, questions were asked
 sansad ke bheetar sharad yadav kaha karte the ki kanoon sadan ke vivek se banegaa
 Not from TV debate and survey
 vaise 24 ghante ke bheetar pradhanmantri ke ap par paanch lakh se zyada logon ne vot kar diya he
 Two questions have polled 98 and 99 percent support
 agar aap aalu kisaan hai, garib janata hai, mazdoor hai to aapako bhi survey main hissaa lenaa chahie
 The question of the survey has also been questioned, but the Prime Minister has thanked everyone for this historic partnership
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke daur kii wo tamaam talkhiyaan, teziyaan kahaan hawa ho gayi hai
 Friends and friends started fighting among themselves
 nai raajnneetik nishthaaen ban rahi thim
 Is all of that happening again? kya notebandi ke baad se aap or aapke mitra samooh main bahesbaazi tej nahin hui he
 It must have happened
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke vakt kii bahason kaa kya hua
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not accept the Lokpal of the Center and announced to make it its Jan Lokpal
 4 disambar 2015 ko dilli vidhansabha main dilli janalokapal bill paas ho gaya
 It was also criticized
 kaha gaya ki jab mukhyamantri kejariwal andolan karte the tab kehete the ki lokapal kii niyukti main netaa zyaada honge to eemaandaaree se kaam nahin kar saktaa he
 But when Janlokpal of Delhi came, there were more leaders in it
 jab isaki aalochana hui to anna ke kehane par dilli hoicourt ke purv chif justise ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 The Jan Lokpal bill has not been implemented even after passing
 iske bhi paas hue kareeb ek saal hone ko aa gaye hai
 Currently, there are Lokayuktas in Delhi
 tippaniyan Recall both rounds
 netaaon main kitna ghamaasan hota tha
 The Lokpal to eradicate corruption did not even come
 lekin is dauraan bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye kai kanoon bane, esaiti bani
 The plan came to declare undisclosed assets
 notebandi aa gai, magar lokapal kaa pad khaali rah gaya
 Opposition has declared a nationwide outrage day on 28 November against the troubles caused by demonetisation and the government's poor preparations
 us vakt bhi yani 23 agast 2011 ko anna hazaare ke aahwan par gaiyr endie ke 9 vipakshi dalon ne rashtravyapee andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Lokpal did not come, it is a fact but it is not that the government forgot about the Lokpal Act
 isi 27 july 2016 ke hindu akhbaar kii report he ki rajya sabha or loksabhaa ne lokapal or lokayukta sanshodhan bill 2016 paas kar diya he
 But this amendment did not change the terms of the selection committee for the appointment of Lokpal
 aap jaanate hai ki chayan samiti main netaa vipaksh hona chahie magar loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he
 Therefore, the appointment is not taking place
 27 july ko jo sanshodhan paas hua wo isliye tha ki 31 july tak adhikariyon ko apni or apane parijanon kii sampatti kaa byora jamaa karnaa tha
 Apart from the officials, the board members and trustees of the NGO were also required to give details of the assets
 sanshodhan ke zariye 31 july kii samay seemaa badha di gai
 Even today, there are many claims to eradicate corruption
 kya ve bhi bhul gaye jo lokapal kii ladaai ladate the
 The Lokpal was mentioned in the uproar of demonetisation, even after the Supreme Court's comment

 Can some questions like Lokpal be asked in this way - Do you know how to make black money? kya aap jaanate hai ki nagdi note ke alaava kaala dhan kitne prakaar ke hote hai? Do you know that money is kept in other countries by creating a fake company? kya aap maanate hai ki sirf notebandi se hi kaala dhan mit jayega? At the time of Lokpal it was asked how much you know about it
 notebandi ke samay bhi poocha janaa chahie ki aap kaala dhan ke bare main kya jaanate hai
 Now everyone is asking, are you with the decision of the government? At least the main question is, are you with the government's decision? Action against corruption will not oppose anyone who is involved in corruption
 'dainik jaagran' or 'hindustan' ke survey hai
 The first question of the survey of 'dainik Jagran' of 19 November is that despite the problems caused by this step, are you in favor of it? 86 included in this survey
 1 pratishat logon ne kaha he ki haa hai
 Has the government taken the right step by closing big notes - 84
 8 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki sahi kadam uthaaya he
 The fourth question is whether this will eliminate black money and further stop its path
 iske jawaab main logon kii raay main baari badlaav dikhataa he
 25 percent say they don't agree, 67
 2 fisadi kehete hai ki sahamat hai
 While 84 percent of those who consider the government's move to be good
 8 or 86
 1 percent
 20 november ko hindi akhbaar dainik hindustan main ek survey prakashit hota he
 In Jagran's survey, the percentage of those who show good steps is 85 or more
 hindustan kaa survey bataata he ki pichley das din main notebandi ke samarthak lagaataar kam hue
 On 8 November, 78 per cent of the people in the survey of Hindustan supported
 saat din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghatakar 61
 93 percent
 10 din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghat kar 46 pratishat ho gai
 The Times of India also conducted a c-voter survey on November 22, according to which 80 per cent people said that they do not care about the problems caused by demonetisation
 sara sawaal isi par he ki faisle ke samarthak hai yaa isse hui takalif ko parvaah karte hai yaa nahin
 It was during the Anna movement that Arvind Kejriwal started a referendum on every aspect related to the Lokpal
 2011 main lokapal kaisaa hona chahie ise lekar puraani dilli or model toun main survey kara diya gaya tha
 There was a lot of mockery then that the law was made by the discretion of the Parliament or by such a survey with missed calls
 notebandi ke daur main yahi survey phir se laut aae hai
 The Prime Minister has released an app on which ten questions have been asked about black money
 bhartiya itihaas kaa itnaa bada faisla
 In the same way, it was said about the Lokpal and these surveys raised questions
 us samay kejariwal survey karke dilli ke auto par chipka dete the
 Those surveys used to be mocked, questions were asked
 sansad ke bheetar sharad yadav kaha karte the ki kanoon sadan ke vivek se banegaa
 Not from TV debate and survey
 vaise 24 ghante ke bheetar pradhanmantri ke ap par paanch lakh se zyada logon ne vot kar diya he
 Two questions have polled 98 and 99 percent support
 agar aap aalu kisaan hai, garib janata hai, mazdoor hai to aapako bhi survey main hissaa lenaa chahie
 The question of the survey has also been questioned, but the Prime Minister has thanked everyone for this historic partnership
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke daur kii wo tamaam talkhiyaan, teziyaan kahaan hawa ho gayi hai
 Friends and friends started fighting among themselves
 nai raajnneetik nishthaaen ban rahi thim
 Is all of that happening again? kya notebandi ke baad se aap or aapke mitra samooh main bahesbaazi tej nahin hui he
 It must have happened
 yaad kiijie lokapal ke vakt kii bahason kaa kya hua
 The Aam Aadmi Party did not accept the Lokpal of the Center and announced to make it its Jan Lokpal
 4 disambar 2015 ko dilli vidhansabha main dilli janalokapal bill paas ho gaya
 It was also criticized
 kaha gaya ki jab mukhyamantri kejariwal andolan karte the tab kehete the ki lokapal kii niyukti main netaa zyaada honge to eemaandaaree se kaam nahin kar saktaa he
 But when Janlokpal of Delhi came, there were more leaders in it
 jab isaki aalochana hui to anna ke kehane par dilli hoicourt ke purv chif justise ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 The Jan Lokpal bill has not been implemented even after passing
 iske bhi paas hue kareeb ek saal hone ko aa gaye hai
 Currently, there are Lokayuktas in Delhi
 tippaniyan Recall both rounds
 netaaon main kitna ghamaasan hota tha
 The Lokpal to eradicate corruption did not even come
 lekin is dauraan bhrashtachar se ladane ke liye kai kanoon bane, esaiti bani
 The plan came to declare undisclosed assets
 notebandi aa gai, magar lokapal kaa pad khaali rah gaya
 Opposition has declared a nationwide outrage day on 28 November against the troubles caused by demonetisation and the government's poor preparations
 us vakt bhi yani 23 agast 2011 ko anna hazaare ke aahwan par gaiyr endie ke 9 vipakshi dalon ne rashtravyapee andolan kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Lokpal did not come, it is a fact but it is not that the government forgot about the Lokpal Act
 isi 27 july 2016 ke hindu akhbaar kii report he ki rajya sabha or loksabhaa ne lokapal or lokayukta sanshodhan bill 2016 paas kar diya he
 But this amendment did not change the terms of the selection committee for the appointment of Lokpal
 aap jaanate hai ki chayan samiti main netaa vipaksh hona chahie magar loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he
 Therefore, the appointment is not taking place
 27 july ko jo sanshodhan paas hua wo isliye tha ki 31 july tak adhikariyon ko apni or apane parijanon kii sampatti kaa byora jamaa karnaa tha
 Apart from the officials, the board members and trustees of the NGO were also required to give details of the assets
 sanshodhan ke zariye 31 july kii samay seemaa badha di gai
 Even today, there are many claims to eradicate corruption
 us vakt lokapal ke samarthan main bolne vaale 125 karod bhartiya kii taraf se bolte the
 Even now the supporters of demonetisation are saying 'whole country whole country'
 lokapal ke samay vaala desh kaise bhul gaya
 How will we not forget the country during the time of demonetisation, how can we claim it
 lokapal kii niyukti ek pahalu he
 What is the structure of the institution called Lokpal has been prepared
 prashanth bhushan kii team ne supreme court main ek yachika daayar kii thi jis par adaalat kii tippanee ai he
 From Lokpal to demonetisation the dream is the same, corruption should be eradicated
 notebandi vaale bhi lokapal ke liye phir se sangharsh kar sakate hai
 The Supreme Court has also said that the Lokpal should not be allowed to become a dead letter
 sarkaar ko iske liye ek dedline tay kerani hogi
 There will be a hearing again on 7 December
 maujuuda loksabhaa main netaa vipaksh nahin he or lokapal kii niyukti kii cameti main netaa vipaksh kaa hona zaruri he
 This rule of appointment has to be changed
 2014 ke baad ke sansad ke satron ke ricard kaam karne kii khabaren aati hai
 There are reports of many bills passing
 jiesti jaisaa asambhav sa lagane vaala bill paas ho gaya
 Who is not interested in the appointment of Lokpal? yah raay kab ban gai ki bhrashtachar mitaane main lokapal kaa koi role hi nahin he
 The Lokpal movement also changed the media
 jo tivi channel bhoot pret main lage hue the ve bhrashtachar kii ladaai kaa prasaaran centre ban gaye
 It is here that the period of anchors becoming the Messiah begins
 azaadi part tu laanch kar di gai
 Everyone felt that they are busy arguing for the independence of the country
 jaisaa ab bataaya ja rahaa he ki aap jis takalif se guzar rahe hai wo desh ke liye he
 Common people moved from TV studio to mic
 media ne us bhukh ko ujagar kiya
 Programs to eradicate corruption started getting trps
 lokapal hi wo terning point tha jiske kaaran tivi ke band studio kii deevaaren dhah gayi
 The talk of common people started reaching
 jununee bahes aaj bhi ho rahi he bas kisi ko yaad dilaane kii zarurat he ki aisi hi bahes pehle bhi ho chuki he
 Not much three years ago
 is vakt kii tarah us vakt bhi khub survey ho rahe the
 News channels CNN, IBN and CNBC TV18 conducted an all India survey in association with CSDS
 'hindu' akhbaar ne bhi chapa tha
 The report on this survey appeared in the First Post of 9 August 2011
 survey main shaamil 34 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki lokapal kaa naam suna he
 24 percent people said that they know what the Lokpal is
 padhe-likhe logon main 67 fisadi ne lokapal ke bare main suna tha or 51 pratishat ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki lokapal kya he
 All such channels and newspapers may have conducted such surveys, but the question of the survey at that time seems to be that the question about which Lokpal is such a ruckus, if asked how many people have heard the name and how many people know the meaning of Lokpal
 us survey ke sawaal kaaphi baarik the
 What is your opinion on Lokpal? Do you agree with the government's argument? Do you agree with Anna Hazare's argument? abhi kaha ja rahaa he ki sirf amir bhrasht hai, lekin us vakt ke survey main paanch catagori ke bare main poocha gaya tha ki inamen se koun sabase bhrasht he - sarkaar, nirvaachit pratinidhi, nyaaypalika, bijnesaman, udyogpati, enjio or media
 32 per cent of the people surveyed said that the government is the most corrupt and 43 per cent said that the elected leaders are the most corrupt
 isi tarah ke survey in dinon bhi ho rahe hai
 After demonetization, the main question has become whether you are happy with the decision of the government or not
 survey ke sawaal isi ke aasapaas hai
 At that time, people were joining the survey by considering Lokpal as the savior of corruption, now forgetting it, people have started considering demonetisation as the new liberator
 tab bhi vahi log the, ab bhi yahi log hai

 Even today, there are many claims to eradicate corruption
 lokapal se lekar notebandi tak sapana ek hi he, bhrashtachar mitna chahie
 Even demonetisators can fight again for Lokpal
 supreme court ne bhi kaha he ki lokapal ko ek ded letters nahin banane diya janaa chahie
 The government will have to set a deadline for this
 7 disambar ko phir se sunwaayee hogi
 The Leader of the Opposition is not in the current Lok Sabha and it is necessary to have a Leader of the Opposition in the committee appointed for the Lokpal
 niyukti ke isi niyam main badlaav karnaa he
 There are reports of record working of post-2014 Parliament sessions
 kai saare bill ke paas hone kii khabaren aati hai
 a bill that seemed like an impossible GST passed
 lokapal kii niyukti main kiski dilchaspee nahin he
 When did it become an opinion that the Lokpal has no role in eradicating corruption
 lokapal andolan ne media ko bhi badla tha
 The TV channels which were engaged in Bhoot Phantom became the broadcasting center of the fight for corruption
 ankaron ke maseehaa banane kaa daur yaheen se shuru hota he
 Freedom Part Two was launched
 sabko lag rahaa tha ki ve desh kii aazaadee ke liye ji jaan se bahes main jute hai
 As it is now being told that the problem you are going through is for the country
 aam log tivi studio se lekar mike par aa gaye
 The media unleashed that hunger
 bhrashtachar mitaane ke kaaryakramon ko tiarapy milane lagi
 Lokpal was the turning point due to which the closed studio walls of the TV collapsed
 aam logon kii baat pahunchane lagi
 Passionate debate is going on even today, just need to remind someone that similar debate has been done earlier
 zyada nahin teen saal pehle
 Like this time, a lot of surveys were being done at that time
 news channel sienen, ibien or sienbisi tivi 18 ne siesds ke saath milakar ek akhil bhartiya survey kiya tha
 The 'hindu' newspaper was also published
 9 agast 2011 ke first post main is survey par report chhapi
 34 percent of the people surveyed said that the name of Lokpal was heard
 24 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki lokapal kya he
 Among educated people, 67 percent had heard about Lokpal and 51 percent said that they know what Lokpal is
 aise survey tamaam channelon or akhabaaron ne kiye honge, lekin us samay ke survey kaa sawaal thik lagata he ki jis lokapal ko lekar itnaa hangaamaa he zaraa poocha to jaae ki kitne logon ne naam suna he or kitne logon ko lokapal kaa matlab pataa he
 The questions in that survey were very nuanced
 lokapal par aapke kya mat hai? kya aap sarkaar ke tark se sahamat hai? kya aap anna hazaare ke tark se sahamat hai? It is being said that only the rich are corrupt, but the survey at that time asked about five categories of which are the most corrupt - government, elected representatives, judiciary, businessmen, industrialists, ngos and media
 survey main shaamil 32 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki sarkaar sabase bhrasht he or 43 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki chune hue netaa sabase bhrasht hai
 Similar surveys are also being conducted these days
 notebandi ke baad mukhya sawaal yahi ho gaya he ki aap sarkaar ke faisle se khush hai yaa nahin
 Survey questions are around this
 tab lokapal ko log bhrashtachar kaa muktidaata maan kar survey main shaamil ho rahe the, ab use bhul kar log notebandi ko nayaa muktidaata maanane lage hai
 Even then there were the same people, still the same people
 kya lokapal kii tarah kuch sawaal is tarah se puche ja sakate hai jaise -kya aap jaanate hai ki kaala dhan kaise kaise banataa he? Do you know what are the types of black money other than cash notes? kya aap jaanate hai ki farji company banaakar duusare deshon main paisa rakhaa jaataa he? Do you believe that black money will be eradicated only by demonetisation? lokapal ke samay yah poocha gaya ki aap iske bare main kitna jaanate hai
 At the time of demonetisation it should also be asked what you know about black money
 ab har koi yahi puch rahaa he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? kam se kam mukhya sawaal to yahi he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai kaa virodh wo bhi nahin karegaa jo bhrashtachar main shaamil he
 There are surveys of 'dainik Jagran' and 'hindustan'
 19 november ke 'dainik jaagran' ke survey kaa pehla sawaal he ki is kadam se hone vaali pareshaani ke baavjood aap iske paksh main hai? is survey main shaamil 86
 1 percent people said that yes
 kya bade note band karke sarkaar ne sahi kadam uthaaya he- 84
 8 percent of the people have said that they have taken the right steps
 chauthaa sawaal he ki kya isse kaala dhan samaapt ho jayega or aage iske raste band ho jaaenge
 In response to this, there is a huge change in the opinion of people
 25 pratishat log kehete hai ki sahamat nahin hai, 67
 2 percent say they agree
 jabaki sarkaar ke kadam ko acha maanane waalon kaa pratishat 84
 8 and 86
 1 pratishat he
 On 20 November, a survey is published in Hindi newspaper Dainik Hindustan
 jaagran ke survey main acha kadam bataane waalon kii pratishat 85 yaa usase adhik he
 The survey of Hindustan shows that the supporters of demonetisation decreased continuously in the last ten days
 8 november ko hi hindustan ke survey main 78 fisadi logon ne samarthan kiya tha
 Seven days later the number of supporters decreased to 61
 93 pratishat ho gai
 After 10 days, the number of supporters reduced to 46 percent
 times aaf india ne bhi 22 november ko si-voter kaa ek survey chapa he jiske anusaar 80 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki ve notebandi se hone vaali takalifon kii parvaah nahin karte
 The whole question is whether the supporters of the verdict or care about the suffering caused by it
 anna andolan ke dauraan hi arvind kejariwal ne lokapal se jude har pahalu par janamat sangrah kaa chalan shuru kiya tha
 In 2011, a survey was conducted in Old Delhi and Model Town regarding what the Lokpal should be like
 tab kaaphi mazaaq uda tha ki kanoon sansad ke vivek se banataa he yaa is tarah se missd kol vaale survey se
 These surveys have returned again in the era of demonetisation
 pradhanmantri ne ap jari kiya he jisapar kaale dhan ko lekar das sawaal puche gaye hai
 Such a big decision in Indian history
 usee tarah se lokapal ke bare main kaha jaataa tha or in survey par sawaal uthte the
 At that time Kejriwal used to survey and paste on Delhi's auto
 un survey kaa mazaaq udata tha, sawaal hote the
 Within Parliament, Sharad Yadav used to say that the law will be made at the discretion of the House
 tivi kii bahes or survey se nahin
 However, more than five lakh people have voted on the Prime Minister's app within 24 hours
 do sawaalon main to 98 or 99 pratishat samarthan main mat mili hai
 If you are potato farmer, poor people, laborer then you should also take part in the survey
 survey ke sawaal par bhi sawaal hua he, lekin pradhanmantri ne is aitihaasik bhagidaari ke liye sabakaa aabhaar jataayaa he
 Recall where all the tantrums, the bulls of the Lokpal era have become
 dost-dost aapas main ladane lage the
 New political loyalties were being formed
 kahin vahi sab to phir se nahin ho rahaa he
 Has debating between you and your group of friends not accelerated since demonetisation
 zarur hui hogi
 Recall what happened to the debates during Lokpal's time
 aam aadmi party ne centre ke lokapal ko sweekaar nahin kiya or apana janalokapal banane kaa elaan kar diya
 On 4 December 2015, the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill was passed in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 isaki bhi aalochana hui
 It was said that when Chief Minister Kejriwal used to agitate, he used to say that if there will be more leaders in the appointment of Lokpal, then it cannot work honestly
 lekin jab dilli kaa janalokapal aayaa to usamen netaa hi zyaada the
 When it was criticized, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court was also included at the behest of Anna
 janalokapal bill paas hokar bhi lagu nahin hua he
 Nearly a year has passed for this too
 philhal dilli main lokayukta hai
 The comments donon daur ko yaad kiijie
 There was so much pride among the leaders
 bhrashtachar ko mitaane vaala lokapal aayaa bhi nahin
 But during this time many laws were made to fight corruption, SIT was made
 aghoshit sampatti ghoshit karne kii yojana ai
 Demonetisation came, but the post of Lokpal remained vacant
 notebandi se hone vaali pareshaaniyon or sarkaar kii lachar taiyaariyon ke khilaaf vipaksh ne 28 november ko deshvyapee aakrosh diwas kaa elaan kiya he
 At that time also, on 23 August 2011, on the call of Anna Hazare, 9 opposition parties of non-nda supported the nationwide movement
 lokapal nahin aayaa ye ek tathy he par aisa nahin he ki sarkaar lokapal kanoon ke bare main bhul hi gai
 The same Hindu newspaper reported on 27 July 2016 that the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have passed the Lokpal and Lokayukta Amendment Bill 2016
 magar is sanshodhan kaa sambadh lokapal kii niyukti ke liye chayan samiti kii sharton ko badalanaa nahin tha
 You know that the Leader of the Selection Committee should be the Opposition but the Leader in the Lok Sabha is not the Opposition
 isliye niyukti nahin ho rahi he
 The amendment that was passed on 27 July was because by 31 July the authorities had to submit the details of the property of themselves and their families
 adhikariyon ke alaava enjio ke board member or trustee ko bhi sampatti kaa byora dena tha
 The amendment extended the July 31 deadline
 is vakt bhi bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii khub daavedaariyaan ho rahi hai
 Freedom Part Two was launched
 sabko lag rahaa tha ki ve desh kii aazaadee ke liye ji jaan se bahes main jute hai
 As it is now being told that the problem you are going through is for the country
 aam log tivi studio se lekar mike par aa gaye

 At the time of demonetisation it should also be asked what you know about black money
 ab har koi yahi puch rahaa he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? kam se kam mukhya sawaal to yahi he ki kya aap sarkaar ke faisle ke saath hai? bhrashtachar ke khilaaf karrwai kaa virodh wo bhi nahin karegaa jo bhrashtachar main shaamil he
 There are surveys of 'dainik Jagran' and 'hindustan'
 19 november ke 'dainik jaagran' ke survey kaa pehla sawaal he ki is kadam se hone vaali pareshaani ke baavjood aap iske paksh main hai? is survey main shaamil 86
 1 percent people said that yes
 kya bade note band karke sarkaar ne sahi kadam uthaaya he- 84
 8 percent of the people have said that they have taken the right steps
 chauthaa sawaal he ki kya isse kaala dhan samaapt ho jayega or aage iske raste band ho jaaenge
 In response to this, there is a huge change in the opinion of people
 25 pratishat log kehete hai ki sahamat nahin hai, 67
 2 percent say they agree
 jabaki sarkaar ke kadam ko acha maanane waalon kaa pratishat 84
 8 and 86
 1 pratishat he
 On 20 November, a survey is published in Hindi newspaper Dainik Hindustan
 jaagran ke survey main acha kadam bataane waalon kii pratishat 85 yaa usase adhik he
 The survey of Hindustan shows that the supporters of demonetisation decreased continuously in the last ten days
 8 november ko hi hindustan ke survey main 78 fisadi logon ne samarthan kiya tha
 Seven days later the number of supporters decreased to 61
 93 pratishat ho gai
 After 10 days, the number of supporters reduced to 46 percent
 times aaf india ne bhi 22 november ko si-voter kaa ek survey chapa he jiske anusaar 80 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki ve notebandi se hone vaali takalifon kii parvaah nahin karte
 The whole question is whether the supporters of the verdict or care about the suffering caused by it
 anna andolan ke dauraan hi arvind kejariwal ne lokapal se jude har pahalu par janamat sangrah kaa chalan shuru kiya tha
 In 2011, a survey was conducted in Old Delhi and Model Town regarding what the Lokpal should be like
 tab kaaphi mazaaq uda tha ki kanoon sansad ke vivek se banataa he yaa is tarah se missd kol vaale survey se
 These surveys have returned again in the era of demonetisation
 pradhanmantri ne ap jari kiya he jisapar kaale dhan ko lekar das sawaal puche gaye hai
 Such a big decision in Indian history
 usee tarah se lokapal ke bare main kaha jaataa tha or in survey par sawaal uthte the
 At that time Kejriwal used to survey and paste on Delhi's auto
 un survey kaa mazaaq udata tha, sawaal hote the
 Within Parliament, Sharad Yadav used to say that the law will be made at the discretion of the House
 tivi kii bahes or survey se nahin
 However, more than five lakh people have voted on the Prime Minister's app within 24 hours
 do sawaalon main to 98 or 99 pratishat samarthan main mat mili hai
 If you are potato farmer, poor people, laborer then you should also take part in the survey
 survey ke sawaal par bhi sawaal hua he, lekin pradhanmantri ne is aitihaasik bhagidaari ke liye sabakaa aabhaar jataayaa he
 Recall where all the tantrums, the bulls of the Lokpal era have become
 dost-dost aapas main ladane lage the
 New political loyalties were being formed
 kahin vahi sab to phir se nahin ho rahaa he
 Has debating between you and your group of friends not accelerated since demonetisation
 zarur hui hogi
 Recall what happened to the debates during Lokpal's time
 aam aadmi party ne centre ke lokapal ko sweekaar nahin kiya or apana janalokapal banane kaa elaan kar diya
 On 4 December 2015, the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill was passed in the Delhi Legislative Assembly
 isaki bhi aalochana hui
 It was said that when Chief Minister Kejriwal used to agitate, he used to say that if there will be more leaders in the appointment of Lokpal, then it cannot work honestly
 lekin jab dilli kaa janalokapal aayaa to usamen netaa hi zyaada the
 When it was criticized, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court was also included at the behest of Anna
 janalokapal bill paas hokar bhi lagu nahin hua he
 Nearly a year has passed for this too
 philhal dilli main lokayukta hai
 The comments donon daur ko yaad kiijie
 There was so much pride among the leaders
 bhrashtachar ko mitaane vaala lokapal aayaa bhi nahin
 But during this time many laws were made to fight corruption, SIT was made
 aghoshit sampatti ghoshit karne kii yojana ai
 Demonetisation came, but the post of Lokpal remained vacant
 notebandi se hone vaali pareshaaniyon or sarkaar kii lachar taiyaariyon ke khilaaf vipaksh ne 28 november ko deshvyapee aakrosh diwas kaa elaan kiya he
 At that time also, on 23 August 2011, on the call of Anna Hazare, 9 opposition parties of non-nda supported the nationwide movement
 lokapal nahin aayaa ye ek tathy he par aisa nahin he ki sarkaar lokapal kanoon ke bare main bhul hi gai
 The same Hindu newspaper reported on 27 July 2016 that the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha have passed the Lokpal and Lokayukta Amendment Bill 2016
 magar is sanshodhan kaa sambadh lokapal kii niyukti ke liye chayan samiti kii sharton ko badalanaa nahin tha
 You know that the Leader of the Selection Committee should be the Opposition but the Leader in the Lok Sabha is not the Opposition
 isliye niyukti nahin ho rahi he
 The amendment that was passed on 27 July was because by 31 July the authorities had to submit the details of the property of themselves and their families
 adhikariyon ke alaava enjio ke board member or trustee ko bhi sampatti kaa byora dena tha
 The amendment extended the July 31 deadline
 is vakt bhi bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii khub daavedaariyaan ho rahi hai
 Like this time, a lot of surveys were being done at that time
 news channel sienen, ibien or sienbisi tivi 18 ne siesds ke saath milakar ek akhil bhartiya survey kiya tha
 The 'hindu' newspaper was also published
 9 agast 2011 ke first post main is survey par report chhapi
 34 percent of the people surveyed said that the name of Lokpal was heard
 24 pratishat logon ne kaha tha ki unhen pataa he ki lokapal kya he
 Among educated people, 67 percent had heard about Lokpal and 51 percent said that they know what Lokpal is
 aise survey tamaam channelon or akhabaaron ne kiye honge, lekin us samay ke survey kaa sawaal thik lagata he ki jis lokapal ko lekar itnaa hangaamaa he zaraa poocha to jaae ki kitne logon ne naam suna he or kitne logon ko lokapal kaa matlab pataa he
 The questions in that survey were very nuanced
 lokapal par aapke kya mat hai? kya aap sarkaar ke tark se sahamat hai? kya aap anna hazaare ke tark se sahamat hai? It is being said that only the rich are corrupt, but the survey at that time asked about five categories of which are the most corrupt - government, elected representatives, judiciary, businessmen, industrialists, ngos and media
 survey main shaamil 32 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki sarkaar sabase bhrasht he or 43 fisadi logon ne kaha tha ki chune hue netaa sabase bhrasht hai
 Similar surveys are also being conducted these days
 notebandi ke baad mukhya sawaal yahi ho gaya he ki aap sarkaar ke faisle se khush hai yaa nahin
 Survey questions are around this
 tab lokapal ko log bhrashtachar kaa muktidaata maan kar survey main shaamil ho rahe the, ab use bhul kar log notebandi ko nayaa muktidaata maanane lage hai
 Even then there were the same people, still the same people
 kya lokapal kii tarah kuch sawaal is tarah se puche ja sakate hai jaise -kya aap jaanate hai ki kaala dhan kaise kaise banataa he? Do you know what are the types of black money other than cash notes? kya aap jaanate hai ki farji company banaakar duusare deshon main paisa rakhaa jaataa he? Do you believe that black money will be eradicated only by demonetisation? lokapal ke samay yah poocha gaya ki aap iske bare main kitna jaanate hai
 At the time of demonetisation it should also be asked what you know about black money

 is vakt bhi bhrashtachar ko mitaane kii khub daavedaariyaan ho rahi hai
 All such channels and newspapers may have conducted such surveys, but the question of the survey at that time seems to be that the question about which Lokpal is such a ruckus, if asked how many people have heard the name and how many people know the meaning of Lokpal
 us survey ke sawaal kaaphi baarik the
 What is your opinion on Lokpal? Do you agree with the government's argument? Do you agree with Anna Hazare's argument? abhi kaha ja rahaa he ki sirf amir bhrasht hai, lekin us vakt ke survey main paanch catagori ke bare main poocha gaya tha ki inamen se koun sabase bhrasht he - sarkaar, nirvaachit pratinidhi, nyaaypalika, bijnesaman, udyogpati, enjio or media
 32 per cent of the people surveyed said that the government is the most corrupt and 43 per cent said that the elected leaders are the most corrupt
 isi tarah ke survey in dinon bhi ho rahe hai
 After demonetization, the main question has become whether you are happy with the decision of the government or not
 survey ke sawaal isi ke aasapaas hai
 At that time, people were joining the survey by considering Lokpal as the savior of corruption, now forgetting it, people have started considering demonetisation as the new liberator
 tab bhi vahi log the, ab bhi yahi log hai
 Can some questions like Lokpal be asked in this way - Do you know how to make black money? kya aap jaanate hai ki nagdi note ke alaava kaala dhan kitne prakaar ke hote hai? Do you know that money is kept in other countries by creating a fake company? kya aap maanate hai ki sirf notebandi se hi kaala dhan mit jayega? At the time of Lokpal it was asked how much you know about it
 notebandi ke samay bhi poocha janaa chahie ki aap kaala dhan ke bare main kya jaanate hai
 Now everyone is asking, are you with the decision of the government? At least the main question is, are you with the government's decision? Action against corruption will not oppose anyone who is involved in corruption
 'dainik jaagran' or 'hindustan' ke survey hai
 The first question of the survey of 'dainik Jagran' of 19 November is that despite the problems caused by this step, are you in favor of it? 86 included in this survey
 1 pratishat logon ne kaha he ki haa hai
 Has the government taken the right step by closing big notes - 84
 8 fisadi logon ne kaha he ki sahi kadam uthaaya he
 The fourth question is whether this will eliminate black money and further stop its path
 iske jawaab main logon kii raay main baari badlaav dikhataa he
 25 percent say they don't agree, 67
 2 fisadi kehete hai ki sahamat hai
 While 84 percent of those who consider the government's move to be good
 8 or 86
 1 percent
 20 november ko hindi akhbaar dainik hindustan main ek survey prakashit hota he
 In Jagran's survey, the percentage of those who show good steps is 85 or more
 hindustan kaa survey bataata he ki pichley das din main notebandi ke samarthak lagaataar kam hue
 On 8 November, 78 per cent of the people in the survey of Hindustan supported
 saat din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghatakar 61
 93 percent
 10 din baad samarthakon kii sankhya ghat kar 46 pratishat ho gai
 The Times of India also conducted a c-voter survey on November 22, according to which 80 per cent people said that they do not care about the problems caused by demonetisation
 sara sawaal isi par he ki faisle ke samarthak hai yaa isse hui takalif ko parvaah karte hai yaa nahin
 It was during the Anna movement that Arvind Kejriwal started a referendum on every aspect related to the Lokpal
 2011 main lokapal kaisaa hona chahie ise lekar puraani dilli or model toun main survey kara diya gaya tha
 There was a lot of mockery then that the law was made by the discretion of the Parliament or by such a survey with missed calls
 notebandi ke daur main yahi survey phir se laut aae hai
