 According to the police, Mohammed Hasanur and the victim (zakroon Nishan), a resident of Bakhariya village of Chandragama panchayat of Bayasi police station area, had love

 However he said that the culprits will not be spared

 sabhi ko dhanyavad
 He further wrote, "arvind Kejriwal has lost his conscience and faith in this election and will lose his power in eight months
 jitna keechad aap ne dilli main failaayaa he, utana hi camel dilli main khilegaa
 Gambhir's gesture was just before the voting on the allegations of Atishi and AAP handing out anti-women pamphlets
 aatishi ne gambhir par unhen badnaam karne ke liye aise parche baantne kaa aarope lagaaya or vah press conference main ro bhi padi thim
 i pay my respects to every voter in East Delhi and every BJP worker

 Earlier, he had also recommended to the Election Commission to cancel his candidature, accusing Gambhir of having two voter ids
 gambhir 22 march ko hi bhaajapa main shaamil hue 
 Neither it's a 'lovely' cover drive and nor it is an 'atishi' bat

 The popular Angoori Bhabhi i
e
 Shilpa Shinde, the popular TV serial of Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai, has made very sensational and serious allegations against the show's producer Sanjay Kohli
 scindia kii shikaayat par kohli danpati ke khilaaf exiaar darj kar lee gai he lekin danpati apane upar lagaae aaropon kaa court main jawaab dene kii baat kahkar chuppi odhe hue he
 Shilpa has elaborated in her FIR the circumstances she faced
 padhein exiaar main darj karaae gaya shilpa kaa puraa bayaan:-puraani 'anguri bhabhi' kaa bada aarope, galat tareeke se choote the produsar ke pati, fir''maine 'bhaabiji ghar par hai' main november 2010 se kaam karnaa shuru kiya tha
 Our set was in Palghar
 shuru se hi sanjay kohli mere saath budtamiji karata tha
 Sanjay used to say such things that i feel ashamed but i used to ignore because people like this are full in the TV industry
 sanjay kohli sho kii shooting ke dauraan aksar set par aakar mere paas aane kii koshish karata tha
 During this time, Sanjay made many comments like 'you like me', 'you are very sexy', 'you are very hot, i am your big fan'
 serial 'bhaabi ji ghar par hai' se baahar hone par shilpa scindia ne kiya khulhasasanjay meri qamar par bhi galat tareeke se choote the or nazdikiyaan badhaane kii baat kehete the jo mujhe bilkul acha nahin lag rahaa tha or jab main iske liye manaa karti thi to 'kam on itnaa to chalata he, bi friendli' 'galati se ho gaya' aisa bolte the
 i couldn't speak anything because everything in the industry was in the hands of the producers of the show
 vaise bhi mere kaam ke paise unke paas hi the or agar main is baat kii shikaayat unase karti to mere kaam ke paise jo un logon ne dabaa rakhe the wo mujhe waapas nahin milte, is vajah se main chup rahi
 Even after this, there was no difference on Sanjay Kohli
 jisaki vajah se mere saath hui ghatana se main maansik rup se kaaphi pareshaan rahane lagi thi
 i told the producer of the show, Benifer, about the incident that happened to me, on which Benifer told me to shut up and threatened that if i talk to anyone about it, she will kick me out of the show and my career too Will ruin you kyonki unhen pataa tha ki main jis serial main kaam kar rahi hum us serial ke nirmaataa ke khilaaf kuch kar nahin sakati
 The producer spoke on Shilpa's allegations, 'she will not give him any more publicity' The next day, Sanjay Kohli came on the set, when i was in my makeup room
 mechap room main aakar unhone kaha ki 'tum mujhe bahut acchhee lagati ho, main tumhen sho se nahin nikaalnaa chahta
 'I want to have a physical relationship with you, i will give you what you want'
 isamen kuch galat nahin he
 i will always co-operate with you and i speak to my wife often
 'vaise bhi tum meri najaron ke saamne se nahin hatati ho, aise coment kar mujhe kis karne kii koshish kar rahe the
 At that time, i was trying to distance Sanjay Kohli from myself and was opposing him
 usee samay vahaan serial ke kalakaaron kaa mechap karne vaala bharat urf pinku patwa bathroom se baahar niklaa or usne mere saath ho rahi ghatana ko dekha
 Sanjay Kohli left from that moment
 duusare din mujhe samaj main aayaa ki us mechap main bharat ko kaam se nikaal diya gaya
 After that, i do not remember the date and time again, but Sanjay Kohli again talked about having a physical relationship and said that we go out for the promotion of the show
 vahaan kisi ke room main rahakar tum meraa samaadhaan karo, main tumhaara samaadhaan karata hum
 If i continue to protest like this, then he can also force me
 us vakt main vahaan se nikal gai duusare din sanjay ne mujhe apane offis main bulaakar dhamkee di ki agar is sabake baad main chupchaap serial main kaam karti nahin rahi to vah mujhe kisi duusari actress ke saath riples kar denge
 10 months ago, Shilpa Shinde's producer was accused of having a problem like migraine and low blood pressure and the incident that happened to me had a great impact on me, due to which i sought leave from the producer of the show, on which she told me that the show i still have a lot of work left and got me done 10 days work in 2 days
 3 march 2016 ko mujhe anprofeshnal kah kar chuttee de di or mujh par iljaam lagaaya ki main kai chizon kii demand kar rahi hum isliye wo mujhe riples kar rahe hai or media main isaki anunsament kara di
 During that time they did not give me even my three months salary
 itnaa kar ke bhi ve log ruke nahin or mere kariyar ke saare raste unhone band kar die
 Wherever i used to get offers to work, those people used to slander me and get my work stopped
 jis vajah se aaj mere paas kaam nahin he''

 See, the discussion on this issue started in February 2010
 iity council main charchaa hui ki hindustan main koi 100 imtihaan hote hai or sabake liye alag-alag form bharne hote hai
 Now no child can sit in a hundred, but sits in 15-20
 harek maa-baap chaahate hai ki unka baccha iity jaae
 But it has nothing to do with the result of the 12th Jamaat
 chaatr 12veen board ko ahmiyat nahin dete or 8veen-10veen se hi iity ke liye koching shuru kar dete hai
 This is harmful for school, children's education and the country
 america, england, china yaa vishwa main aap kahin bhi dekh lo, ek yaa do test se zyada nahin hota he or usamen 12veen board hameshaa shaamil rahata he
 There is no such system anywhere in the world as in our country
 multiplicity of test se mata-pita or bacchon ke upar aarthik-maansik boj padataa he
 Even then, if the child has not passed in IIT and he has not taken care even of 12th, then he does not live anywhere, neither he gets admission in college nor he comes in IIT, then where will the child go
 agar isamen ol india privet sector bhi aa jaae to capitesan fees kaa maamla bhi khatm ho jayega
 These four goals were discussed
 ye iity council ne sochaa, isamen sarkaar kii koi bhoomika nahin thi
 i can only talk to the council
 kai cameti baithi usamen acharya cameti, ramasami cameti, is bich main kakodakar cameti
 Then Ramasamy Committee and IIT Council Group were formed and discussed everywhere in India
 phir ham is nattejey par pahunche ki ek test hona chahie or usamen skool ko vettege dena chahie
 50 percent school and 50 percent
 nirnay sarvasammati se hua, koi decent nahin tha
 It was decided that the top 50,000 children, including the result of 12th and the result of AIEEE, will be seen as merit in advance and only those who come in merit will take the advance test IIT
 isamen bhi virodh ho gaya
 Not everyone did it, first IIT Kanpur, then Delhi
 jab ye virodh hua to maine joint admician board ko kaha ki aap khud tay kariye isamen sarkaar kii koi dakhlandaji nahin he
 Then there was a board meeting and then decided
 jab faisla kiya to main jaan-bujhkar meeting main nahin gaya kyonki baat ho rahi thi sibbal banaam iity kii
 There was no role of Sibal in it and no interference
 unhone khud faisla kiya or hamane apana liya

 congress ke hi logon ne aapke bill kaa virodh kiya tha?yah bhi ek galat baat he, koun se apane logon ne virodh kiya
 We daily say pass the bill of education tribunal
 ek hamaari party se koi sawaal uthaa de to media main charchaa ho jaati he ki virodh ho rahaa he
 That protest stalled the bill? The bill stalled no, then it was not brought, why not brought
 ham to roj kehete hai bill lekar aao
 If the bill is passed and passed in the Standing Committee, then what is the purpose of protesting in Parliament? nahin, usamen daleel yah di gai ki aapane standig cameti kii siforishein nahin maanin?ajukeshan tribunel main nahin maanin, baaki sari main to maanin
 So why is the rest not getting passed

 You wanted to bring medical and legal education under the ambit of NCHER

 But while i am accused of not taking mps into confidence, this is also wrong

 There is nothing more i can do
 tu-ji maamle main aapane jiro los kaa prajentation diya tha
 Are you up to that? What is the meaning of zero loss, i have given clarification 50 times
 jab sarkaar kii niti thi ki hamen nilaamee kii prakriya nahin kerani
 This was the policy, was it not? jab nilaamee kii niti hi nahin thi, to phir nilaamee ke aadhaar par aap nuksaan kaise kah rahe ho, yah to apane aap main kaalpanik nuksaan he
 i only said that there was no such policy at that time, then what was the meaning of loss
 jab bhi aapane koi bold kadam uthaaya, chaahe shiksha ho yaa internet regulate karne kaa maamla aayaa tha
 (pause in the middle
 )ye galat he
 When i regulate, you give me a single example from 2010 till today in which i have taken any such decision
 main aapse poochta hum ki agar is desh main koi internet par bhadakaau baat kare jisase maahaul bighad saktaa he, to kya ek jimmedaar naagarik ke naate aapako nahin bolnaa chahie

 aaj tak reating – 4 / 5 Congress's flamboyant Chinese comment on Jammu and Kashmir: Tiwari asked the government to question the question
 Hong Kong is surrounded on the issue of Tibet, China has given a statement on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir before China Jinping's visit to India
 china daure par pahunche pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan kii maujuudagi main china ne jammu-kashmir par sanyukt raashtra ke niyamon ke paalan kii baat kahi
 Now this statement is being disputed in India
 congress saansad manish tiwari ne is masale par centre sarkaar se sawaal kiya or kaha ki kyon nahin, bharat china se tibet, honkong ke bare main baat karata he
 Congress leader Manish Tiwari tweeted on Thursday that if Xi Jinping is saying that he is eyeing Jammu and Kashmir, then why does the Prime Minister or the Ministry of External Affairs not say that India is watching the demonstration in Hong Kong about democracy, Xinjiang India is keeping an eye on human rights violations in Tibet, the situation in Tibet and China's interference in South China
 Xi Jingping says he is watching Kashmir but why does @pmoindia / MEA not say 1)we are watching Pro Democracy protests muzzled in Hong Kong
 2) We are watching human rights violations in Xinjiang
 3 )we are watching continued oppression in Tibet 4 )we are watching South China Sea— Manish Tewari (@manishtewari)october 10, 2019kashmir par bayaan se palata china!gauratlab he ki shi jinping ke bharat aane se pehle hi china ne jammu-kashmir ko lekar apane bayaan par palati maari he
 Recently, there was a statement from China that India and Pakistan should talk among themselves on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir
 lekin jab imran khan china pahunche to china ne apane bayaan se you-turn liya or kaha ki china jammu-kashmir ke masale par kareeb se nazar banaae hue hai
 However, India expressed strong opposition to this comment of China and said that the issue of Kashmir is an internal issue of India, in such a case that no other country would give a statement on it
 ise padhein: mahabalipuram main modi-jinping kii mahamulaakaat, kashmir par PAK ko milegi maat!bharat dikhayega china ko aaina?gauratlab he ki ek taraf to china jammu-kashmir par nazar rakhane kii baat karata he, lekin duusari ore apni hi girebaan main jhaankne se gurez karata he
 Because democratic demonstration is going on in China-administered Hong Kong at the moment, but the Chinese government is busy suppressing it
 iske alaava uigar musalamaanon ko bhi china main dabaaya ja rahaa he, jisapar puri duniya kii nazar he
 Read this: India's China bluntly - Kashmir is our internal matter, refrain from making a statement Pakistan, which talks about the country's unity unity, is also silent on this issue
 aise main agar china jammu-kashmir kaa masalaa uthaata he, to bharat kaa kya rukh rahata he isapar bhi har kisi kii nazar he

 When big talk, children should not be worn
 'ovaisi ne apatkaal kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki apatkaal ko nahin bhulaayaa ja saktaa, mahatma gandhi kii hatya, babari vidhwans, 1984 main sikhon kaa katleam, 2002 main jo hua, ye sabhi ghatnaayen aaazaad bharat main dharti hilaa dene vaali thim
 After this, Sambit Patra commented on Owaisi
 rajasthan sarkaar ne haal hi main panchayat adhyadesh paarit karke 2015 ke panchayat raaj chunaavon main shaikshanik yogyata kaa praavdhaan rakhaa tha
 Under this, the marksheet of 8th pass for sarpanches and 10th for zilla parishad members was made necessary, but the public is also well aware to overcome the system
 rajasthan main jahaan 1872 sarpanch chune gaye hai, unamem se 746 ke khilaaf farzi degree or marksheet lagane ke aarope hai
 For example, Mamta Kumari, recently elected sarpanch in Hingota village of Dausa, who is currently absconding, is accused of contesting elections by putting on fake marksheets and transfer certificates
 sirf mamata hi nahin, kai or sarpanch is aarope se ghire hai
 In fact, due to the legislation passed in Rajasthan last year to pass the 8th to contest the sarpanch, 80% of the people of rural parts of the state have lost the ability to contest
 ab ye log farzi certificate ke sahare kaam kar rahe hai
 Former Minister of Panchayati Raj in Rajasthan and now Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria admitted, 'where thousands of people have been elected, there are some people who have contested and won by giving wrong marksheets
 agar unke khilaaf FIR darj hui he to karrwahee hogi
 'he admitted that there are around 600-700 such cases altogether
 philhal sarkaar ke paas nau hazaar se zyaada chune gaye sarpanchon main se 746 ke khilaaf shikaayatein mili hai, inamen se 479 ke khilaaf FIR bhi darj hui he
 a police panchayat election case cell has also been formed in Tonk district of the state, which is investigating these cases
 cell ne haal hi main ek mahila sarpanch shimla devi meena ko giraftaar bhi kiya he
 She became the sarpanch of Badoli village in Tonk
 unhone kota ke ek angrezi madhyam skool herbert skool kaa certificate lagaaya tha
 Bhagwan Sahay Sharma, in-charge of the Panchayat Election Case Cell and the investigating officer of the case told, “I checked the name guidance form and transfer certificate at the time of the election, going to Kota
 vahaan jila shiksha adhikari se bhi sampark kiya or herbert children skool kii jaanch kii to vahaan se marksheet jari hone kaa subut nahin mila
 Comments barmer kaa ek skool to aisa he, jisane bahut man lagaakar janata ke numaayindon kii madad kii
 More than 100 fake certificates were issued from this government secondary school in Kottidi's Dhani
 inamen se 35 chunaav jeet bhi chuke hai
 Police are currently investigating school documents
 jaahir he, sarkaar ne sochaa ki anpadh log loktantr main satta se dur rahen to behatar
 But illiterate people along with educated people found a way out
 aakhir ye log na hote to unhen certificate kahaan se milte
 In Rajasthan, where 1872 sarpanches have been elected, 746 have charges against them for imposing fake degrees and mark sheets
 jaise- dausa ke hingota gaanv main haal hi main sarpanch chuni gayi mamata kumari, jo philhal faraar hai, un par farzi marksheet or transfar certificate lagaakar chunaav ladane kaa aarope he
 Not only Mamta, many more sarpanches are surrounded by this charge
 darasal rajasthan main sarpanch kaa chunaav ladane ke liye 8veen paas hone kaa jo kanoon pichley saal bana he, uski vajah se rajya ke gramin hisson ke 80 fisadi log chunaav ladane kii yogyata kho baithe hai
 Now these people are working with fake certificates
 rajasthan main panchayat raaj mantri rah chuke or ab grahamantri gulab chand kataaria ne mana, 'jahaan hazaron log chune gaye hai vahaan kuch aise bhi log hai, jinhone galat marksheet dekar chunaav ladaa or jeeta bhi
 If an FIR is registered against him, action will be taken
 ' unhone mana ki saare milakar kareeb 600-700 aise maamle hai
 At present, the government has received complaints against 746 out of more than nine thousand elected sarpanches, out of which an FIR has been filed against 479
 rajya ke tonk zile main police kaa ek panchayat chunaav prakaran cell bhi bana diya gaya he, jo in maamalon kii jaanch kar rahaa he
 The cell has recently arrested a woman sarpanch Shimla Devi Meena
 wo tonk ke badoli gaanv kii sarpanch bani thi
 He had a certificate of Herbert School, an English medium school in Kota
 panchayat chunaav prakaran cell ke prabharee or is maamle ke jaanch adhikari bhagwaan sahay sharma ne bataaya, 'chunaav ke samay jo naam nirdesan form hai or transfar certificate hai, unki jaanch maine kota jaakar kii
 He also contacted the District Education Officer and investigated the Herbert Children's School, but there was no evidence of the release of the marksheet
 'tippaniyan There is a school in Barmer, which has very much helped the public representatives
 kotidiyon kii dhaani ke is sarkari madhyamik skool se 100 se zyaada farzi certificate jari kiye gaye
 35 of them have also won elections
 philhal police skool ke dastavezon kii jaanch kar rahi he
 Obviously, the government thought that illiterate people should stay away from power in a democracy
 lekin anpadh logon ne padhe-likhe logon ke saath milakar rasta nikaal liya
 After all, if these people were not there, where would they get the certificate from? darasal rajasthan main sarpanch kaa chunaav ladane ke liye 8veen paas hone kaa jo kanoon pichley saal bana he, uski vajah se rajya ke gramin hisson ke 80 fisadi log chunaav ladane kii yogyata kho baithe hai

 The dismal results of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar by-elections have become a cause of concern for the Bharatiya Janata Party
 khaskar, upi kii gorakhpur or phulpur loksabhaa seat haarana party ke liye bada jhatka mana ja rahaa he
 However, after the defeat of his traditional Gorakhpur seat, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is giving reason for over-confidence behind it
 lekin party hai-kaman ne unhen dilli talab kiya he
 It is being told that Yogi Adityanath has been called to Delhi today
 jahaan shaam main bijepi ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah se unki mulaakaat hogi
 It is believed that the results of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur by-elections can be discussed in this meeting
 shanivaar shaam 5 bajaamit shah or yogi adityanathke bich yah baithak hogi
 Please tell that earlier Yogi Adityanath canceled many of his programs after the defeat
 yogi ne guuruuvaar ko hone vaale apane saare raajnneetik kaarykram radd kar die the
 According to the schedule, Yogi Adityanath was to go to Gonda, where Yogi was to participate in the 4-day folk art festival
 lekin ab unki jagah upmukhyamantri dinesh sharma mahotsav main hissaa lenge
 Yogi was to unveil the statue of Nanaji Deshmukh in the program
 14 march ko aae nattijeygorakhpur-phulpur loksabhaa seat par hue upachunaav ke nattejey 14 march ko ghoshit kiye gaye

 lekin siem or dipti siem kii jimmedaari milane ke baad ye seat khaali ho gai thi, jiske baad yahaan 11 march ko voting karai gai thi
 Let me tell you that till now Gorakhpur seat of East Purvanchal has been considered as the strongest fort of the BJP, but in the by-election this safe fort was broken
 pichley 30 saal se bijepi ke liye ajey rahe gorakhpur loksabhaa seat par hue upachunaav main basapa ke samarthan se sapa ne jeet kaa paracham laharaa diya he
 The BJP candidate not only lost from the Gorakhpur parliamentary seat, but the Gorakhnath monastery of which Yogi Adityanath Mahant is, also got less than 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 gorakhnath math vaale booth (booth sankhya 250) par bijepi ummidavaar upendra shukla ko mahaj 182 vot mili
 While Yogi Adityanath got 233 votes in the 2014 election
 haalanki yogi or gorakhpur kii siyasat kaa sabase bada centre gorakhnath math pichley teen dashak se he
 At the same time, Yogi Adityanath had said on the defeat that we failed to understand this (BSP-SP) alliance, which is also a reason for overconfidence

 US President Donald Trump has been subject to criticism on social media for his ignorance about South Asian countries
 yahi nahin, media kii khabaron ke anusaar, unhone donon deshon ke naam kaa uccharan bhi galat kiya
 Donald Trump feels that Nepal and Bhutan are in India
 unhone nepal ko 'nipple' (nipple) or bhutan ko 'buton (button) bataaya
 Yes, it is not a joke
 trump ne sach main aisa kaha he
 The reporter of Time magazine has given this information in one of his articles
 is artical kaa hissaa is prakaar he- ' dakshin asia par ek charchaa ke dauraan trump ke salaahkaar ek map lekar aae jisamen afghanistan se lekar bangladesh tak sabhi deshon ko darshaya gaya tha
 This information was given by the officials of Congress and Intelligence Department involved in this meeting
 unke mutabik trump ne nakshe kii ore oongli karke kaha ki ve yah jaanate hai ki nepal, bharat kaa hissaa he, is par unhen bataaya gaya ki nepal ek swatantra desh he
 Similarly, he said that he knows about Bhutan, it is also a part of India, but then he was told that Bhutan is also an independent country, according to the news of Politico, Trump met India's PM Narendra Modi in 2017
 Before this briefing was being done
 isamen raashtrapati trump ne nepal ko 'nipple' or bhutan ko 'buton' bataaya
 Meanwhile, Trump delivered a State of the Union address at the US Congress in which he discussed the us-mexico border, foreign policy and many issues
 raashtrapati donald trump ne apane state of di union bhaashan main ek baar phir kaha ki wo america-mexico seemaa par diwaar banane ke liye patibaddh hai
 Speaking at the US House of Representatives, the lower house of Congress, Trump said that this wall is extremely important for the US, as it will go a long way in preventing the smuggling of illegal immigrants and drugs from across the border
 raashtrapati trump ne apane kaarykaal kaa doosraa state of di nesan bhaashan diya he
 Trump said that illegal immigrants coming to America is a major national problem
 haalanki trump ne diwaar kii funding kaa rasta aasaan karne ke liye ise border immergency nahin kaha
 Trump appealed to both Democrats and the Republican Party to resolve the matter by February 15 by settling down
 gauratlab he ki trump aksar apni agyanta bhare ajeeb bayaan kii vajah se soshal media main aalochana kaa shikaar hote hai

 It accelerates during the crop preparation season
 kisaanon ko dhan ke avshesh main aag lagane se hatotsahit karne ke liye rajya sarkaron ke uthaae gaye kadamon kaa vastav main koi asar nahin padaa
 Despite the Punjab and Haryana state governments banning the burning of residues and providing stricter punishments to farmers who do not accept it, many farms in both states were seen on fire
 punjab main amarinder singh kii aguai vaali congress sarkaar ne pichley hafte bhi dipti kamishnar ko avagya karne vaale kisaanon ke bhoomi dastavej (khasra girdaavari) par laal nishaan lagane kaa nirdesh diya tha
 The landowners were warned that they could be denied loans and farming equipment from the cooperative society if they had such marks
 lekin ise rajya sarkaar kaa dikhaava bataate hue kisaan sanghathanon ne kaha ki ve koi bhi nateeja bhugatne ko taiyaar hai
 Manjit Singh Dhaner, vice-president of the Daconda faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), announced that the government has only one way to prevent farmers from burning paddy residue
 kisaan chaahate hai ki yaa to sarkaar buaai ke liye aavashyak mashinari pradaan kare yaa mitti se puaal ko alag karne kii ucch laagat kii bharpai ke liye prati quintal 200 ru

 But most farmers its high cost (1
 3 lakh rupee) kaa kharch nahin uthaa sakate or upkarnon kii kharid ke liye sabsidi milanaa kathin he
 The Environmental Pollution (prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) appointed by the Supreme Court estimates that 350 lakh tonnes of paddy residues were burnt in punjab-haryana for cleaning the fields for the sowing of rabi wheat
 nasa ke ekua upgrah kii nigaraanee se pataa chalaa he ki 20-25 aktubar ke aasapaas uttar-pashchimi bharat main baari maatra main fasal ke avasheshon ko jalaayaa gaya
 The thick smoke pushes the earth amid the decreasing temperature and suffocates the people of Delhi and many other cities
 dhan ke avasheshon ko jalaane se mitti ke poshak tatv bhi kam hote hai
 Agricultural scientists estimate that 5 from the soil by burning one ton of paddy pegs
 5 kilogram nitrogen, 2
 3 kg phosphorus, 2
 5 kilogram potacium or 1
 2 kg of sulfur is destroyed
 ipisie kii vyapak kaary yojana punjab or haryana main fasal ke avasheshon ko jalaane par pratibandh ko sakhti se lagu karne kii maang karti he
 But due to the slowness in subsidizing the purchase of Happy Seeder and other equipment, the ban on the part of the farmers of these two states is unlikely to be followed

 All eyes are on Uttar Pradesh, the state with the highest number of seats in the country
 aise main upi ke purvanchal kii aisi 5 siten hai, jahaan diggajon kii pratishtha daanv par he
 It includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his cabinet colleague, veteran SP SP Mulayam Singh and veteran leaders like RPN Singh
 uttar pradesh main maaya-akhilesh gathbandhan or purvanchal prabharee ke taur par congress mahasachiv priyanka wadra kii raajnneetik entry ne purvanchal ke siyaasi mukaable ko or bhi dilachasp bana diya he
 The voting pattern of the last two Lok Sabha elections shows that if these two factors work in these five seats, then the seats of a big minister and UP BJP president can be taken away
 ye paanch siten hai- banaras, azamgarh, mirzapur, chandauli or kushinagar
 In 2014, despite the intense Modi wave, Congress votes were increased in 3 out of these five seats, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi
 haalanki piem ke sansadeey seat varanasi ke voting pattern ko dekhen to congress, sapa-basapa or aam aadmi party ek saath bhi milakar chunaav lade wo pradhanmantri ko haraane main kaamyaab nahin ho paaenge
 How is this possible? After the alliance of Samajwadi Party and BSP and Priyanka's election season, the voting patterns of 2014 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections are seen, then SP-BSP voters in these five seats are seen changing fast
 misaal ke taur par 2014 chunaavon main varanasi seat par bahujan samaaj party ne kareeb 67 fisadi vot khoe or samaajawaadee party ko kareeb 63 fisadi voton kaa nuksaan hua tha
 The huge victory of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and more than 2 lakh votes received by Arvind Kejriwal exposed the SP-BSP poll in Benaras
 yahi vajah he ki donon ek saath chunavi maidan main utar rahe hai
 Both Congress and SP-BSP alliance are eyeing these five seats of Purvanchal
 haalanki maujuuda samay main in paanch siton se 4 siton par philhal endie kaa kabja he
 Varanasi, the most high-profile seat in Varanasi, has made the election here more interesting amid reports of Priyanka landing in Purvanchal
 2014 main yahaan se sirf samaajawaadee party or bispi kaa vot share khiskaa tha
 Despite this wave, the Congress voters remained with him
 espi-bispi ke zyaadaatar vot modi or kejariwal kii taraf shift ho gaye the, lekin mjedaar baat ye he ki congress ke vot 14 fisadi kii badhotaree hui thi
 While SP lost 63 per cent and BSP lost 67 per cent of the votes
 aankadon ke mutabik espi-bispi milakar bhi pradhanmantri modi kaa muqabla nahin karte najar nahin aa rahe hai
 Not only this, even if the entire opposition, in which the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party are also joined, almost 2 lakh votes are seen behind from Modi
 mirzapurmirzapur se vartmaan saansad or endie kii sahyogi apana dal kii adhyaksh anupriya patel ko is baar mushkilen khadi ho sakati hai
 Winning Mirzapur can be a tough challenge for Anupriya, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare in the Modi government
 2014 main bispi pratyaashee samudr bind se 40 fisadi zyada vot mili the
 However, BSP received 9 percent more votes than in 2009
 jabaki samaajawaadee party ko 50 fisadi voton kaa nuksaan hua tha
 
 yahaan ek chaunkaane vaala aankada ye he ki congress ke yahaan bhi voton main 174 fisadi kaa ijapha hua tha
 This time SP and BSP will give a tough fight to Anupriya but they will still not be able to beat them, unless Congress comes with them
 pichley chunavi aankade bataate hai ki agar sapa-basapa or congress yahaan mil jaaen to anupriya patel kii kursi khatre main pad sakati he
 However, the Congress will also be hoping that after Priyanka's arrival, she can give a straight fight to Anupriya Patel on this seat, as Mirzapur has been her traditional seat and since independence, the Congress has won here 6 times
 chandauli2014 main chandauli loksabhaa seat par ek tihaai matadaataaon ne mahendra nath pandey ko jeetaakar loksabhaa bheja tha
 He defeated Anil Kumar Maurya of BSP by about one and a half million votes
 lekin aankade bataate hai ki is baar sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne unki raah main kaante bicha die hai
 4 to Mahendra Pandey in 2014
 14 lakh vot mili the, jabaki sapa basapa ko milakar is seat par 4 lakh 61 hajaar vot mili the
 In such a situation, if the alliance repeats its performance, then this seat may be lost for the BJP
 vahiin, agar congress bhi gathbandhan main shaamil ho gai to mahendranath pandey behad mushkil main honge or unhen 70 hajaar se zyada voton se haar kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 Azamgarh: Ajamgarh is a seat where the SP-BSP alliance is not going to make much difference
 is muslim or yadav bahul kshetra main mulaayam ne apane boote par hi jhande gaad die the
 In 2014, he defeated Ramakant Yadav of BJP by nearly 50 thousand votes
 samaajawaadee party ko 2009 ke mukaable 175 fisadi zyada vot mili the
 In such a situation, it is obvious that BSP has also joined them in 2019, which will directly benefit them
 purvanchal kii jin paanch siton kii charchaa kar rahe hai unamem 2 siton par congress ke vot ghate hai
 Azamgarh seat is also one of these
 mulaayam singh yadav ko kul 3
 4 lakh votes were received and if BSP votes are added to this, then this figure goes beyond 6 lakhs
 yani agar mulaayam yahaan se lade to unki jeet pakki najar aati he
 Kushinagar - Kushinagar seat is truly one of the challenging seats for Priyanka Gandhi
 2014 main bijepi ne congress ke diggaj netaa or purv kendriya mantri arpyen singh se ye seat chin lee thi
 The figures here are also interesting, RPN got 27 percent more votes than in 2009, but bjp's Rajesh Pandey defeated him by more than 85 thousand votes and reached Parliament
 rajesh pandey ko kareeb 39 fisadi vot mili the, jo arpyen se 10 fisadi zyada the
 Statistics show that the Congress will win this seat only if they get the support of the SP-BSP
 aisa hua to congress ummidavaar ko bijepi se kareeb 1
 5 lakh votes can get more
 2009 main yahaan arpyen ne bispi ke swami prasad maury ko haraaya tha
 However, Swami Prasad joined the BJP before the 2017 assembly elections in the state and is currently a minister in the Yogi government
 ye rahaa purvanchal kii 5 charchit siton par aankadon kaa lekha jokha
 But everyone says that 2 and 2 are not four in politics
 ellection tak kai haath milenge, kai baziyaan bichhengi or bisaat par kai nai khilaadi bhi utar sakate hai so asal takat ko voter ke haathon main chipa he

 dilli kii purv mukhyamantri or congress kii varisht netaa shila dikshit kaa aaj nidhan ho gaya
 Delhiites will always remember him as a brilliant Chief Minister who decorated Delhi
 vah lagaataar teen baar dilli kii mukhyamantri raheen
 He did a great job of developing the national capital
 dilli main fliover, sadak, ditisi bas seva, aspataal, uniwarsity or metro ko sthapit karne main shila dikshit kaa bada yogadan mana jaataa he
 He also took steps like removing blue line buses and adding new types of buses to DTC fleet
 dilli ko pradooshan mukt banane ke liye shila dikshit ne mukhyamantri rahete hue sienji kii vyavastha kii thi
 Today Delhi is known for flyovers and ring road
 trephic ko kam karne main ring road kii badi bhoomika he
 Sheila Dixit also played a big role in shaping this ring
 unke mukhyamantri rahane ke dauraan hi ring road ke dhaanche ko aakaar or use vistaar diya gaya
 That is why his name will always be named among the popular chief ministers of the country
 saumy chhavi unki safalataa kaa bada kaaran thi
 It is clear that Delhi is a prosperous state geographically, educationally, culturally and economically, where problems are relatively less common
 bataa den ki dilli main kaaphi kaam shila dikshit ke kaushal se hua
 However, she was lucky and the situation became such that everything went in her favor
 ek samay dilli ko bijepi kaa garh mana jaataa tha, lekin shila dikshit hi vah netaa thim, jinhone bijepi ke kabje se dilli ko nikaalkar congress ko satta par baithaaya tha
 It is not new to spend crores of rupees on advertisements by the central government to promote its schemes
 lekin ab narendra modi sarkaar kii yojanaon ko badhaava dene ke liye chachaa choudhary jaise mashhoor comics paatr kaa bhi sahaara liya ja rahaa he
 Such books have been published for extra study of children besides Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (text books)
 inhen paanchavi se dasvin kaksha ke chaatro ko baanta janaa he
 NCP MP Supriya Sule has raised the issue
 supriya ke mutabik pradhanmantri modi kii ore se laai gai paanch yojanaayen logon ke liye kitni laabhakaari hai, ye bataane ke liye ‘chachaa choudhary’ ke comics kaa istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Supriya Surprised that this comics has been prepared by Maharashtra State Education Department on the instructions of Union Ministry of Human Resource Development and is being distributed among all the Zilla Parishad schools in the state
 aisi keval ek kitaab nahin he balki vibhinn muddon par kai kitabe hai
 There is a biography of PM Modi in a book
 ek kitaab purv pradhanmantri atal bihari vaajapeyi par he
 Comic character Mickey Mouse has also been used in a book
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki is tarah kii kitaaben sabhi pradeshik bhashaaon main print karai gai hai
 Baramati MP Supriya Sule showed the book titled 'chacha Chaudhary and Modi' (chacha Chaudhary and Modi) published in Marathi language at a press conference in Pune
 supriya sule ne aarope lagaaya ki centre sarkaar is had tak chali gai he ki bijepi sarkaar kii yojanaon ko pramot karne ke liye schuli bacchon ko bhi nahin chhod rahi
 The comics are in Marathi language
 supriya sule ne kaha, ‘bacchon ko acha padhane kii aadat viksit kerani chahie lekin ye dukh kii baat he kisarkaar kior se is tarah kii kitaaben banti ja rahi hai
 It is a matter of pleasure that it has a lesson on cleanliness
 lekin har pej par, front par, back par modi sahab kii photo hone ke kya myne hai
 Instead, a picture of Sant Gadge Baba or any other national leader could also be used
 isse aane vaali peedi ke liye anusaran ko koi role model hota
 But sadly, the government is promoting itself for vested interests
 iske liye petrol pampon kaa hi istemaal nahin ab ye is had tak pahunch chuki he ki shiksha ko bhi iske liye jariya banaaya ja rahaa he
 The history of the country is a witness that no party has used the field of education to enhance its ideology
 dukhad he ki sarkari mashinari kaa apane pramotion ke liye lagaataar istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 'on this issue, renowned educationist Herumb Kulkarni told India Today,' This government has a habit of playing its praises
 hakeekat ye he ki apane kaam ke naam par bataane ke liye iske paas zyada kuch nahin he
 This is the reason why the BJP government is not leaving school children too for their propaganda
 centre sarkaar shiksha main bhi dakhal de rahi he
 This is very sad
 ’artiai activist vihaar dhurve kaa kahana he ki kitaab ke har pej par modi kii tasviir kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, iske myne ye he ki bijepi modi ko zyada pramot karne main shaamil hai
 And it has very little message for supplementary level reading for children
 ek sarkari adhikari ne naam nahin kholane kii shart par bataaya ki 80 prakashkon se 3000 kitabon kii saamagree mangai gai thi, unamem se 1600 kitabon ko shortlist kiya gaya, jinhen 69 prakashkon ne print kiya
 Supriya Sule, the Hindi translation of the first page of Marathi comics called Chacha Chaudhary and Modi, in a press conference - "modi has proved himself as a leader in the world
" unki leadership main puri duniya kah rahi he ki bharat badal rahaa he
 They work for 20 hours a day and make plans for the betterment of India
 ye yojanaayen hai-1
 Ujjwala Scheme 2
 beti bachaao, beti padhaao3
 Digital India 4
 notebandi5
 GST on the same page on the left side says the character of Chacha Chaudhary says - we all should take part in these schemes and make them successful
 aisa karne se desh aage badhegaa
 Other pages of comics mention 'beti Bachao, Beti Padhao', demonetisation, GST, digital payment, Ujjwala scheme etc
 to promote girls in every field

 In the midst of the glamor of Diwali, how to protect yourself from health related problems and how elderly and sick people should take care of their health with firecrackers
 jepi hospital ke pulmonary va critical care medicine ke varisht visheshgy dow
 Gyanendra Agarwal asked how the smoke of firecrackers affects asthma patients or common people
 Dr
 agarwal ne kaha ki roshni kaa tyohaar diwali apane saath bahut sari khushiyaan lekar aata he, lekin dama, siopidi yaa allergic rahinitis se peedit marijon kii samasya in dinon bad jaati he
 Small particles present in firecrackers affect the health, which affects the lungs
 is tarah se pataakhon ke dhune se fefdon main sujan aa sakati he, jisase fefde apana kaam thik se nahin kar pate or halaat yahaan tak bhi pahunch sakate hai ki orgen phelior or maut tak ho sakati he
 In such a situation, try to avoid smoke
 dow
 Aggarwal says that smoke from firecrackers can cause asthma or asthma attack
 hanikaarak vishakt kanon ke fefdon main pahunchane se aisa ho saktaa he, jisase vyakti ko jaan kaa khatra bhi ho saktaa he
 In such a situation, people who have respiratory problems should protect themselves from polluted air
 pataakhon ke dhuen se harntac or stroke kaa khatra bhi paidaa ho saktaa he
 The lead present in firecrackers is dangerous for health, due to which there is an increased risk of heart attack and stroke
 jab pataakhon se nikalne vaala dhuna saans ke saath sharir main jaataa he to khun ke pravaah main rukaawat aane lagati he
 The person may become a victim of stroke due to insufficient blood flow to the brain
 dow
 Gyanendra Agarwal says that children and pregnant women should stay away from the noise and smoke of firecrackers
 pataakhon se niklaa gadha dhuaan khaastaur par chote bacchon main saans kii samasyaayein paidaa karata he
 Firecrackers contain harmful chemicals, due to which the levels of toxins in the body of children are increased and their growth is hindered
 pataakhon ke dhunai se garbhpaat kii sambhaavna bhi bad jaati he, isliye garbhvatee mahilaon ko bhi aise samay main ghar par hi rahanaa chahie
 Dr
 agarwal bataate hai ki pataakhe ko rang-birangaa banane ke liye inamen radioective or jahrile padaarthon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 While these substances pollute the air on the one hand, on the other hand, there is a possibility of cancer
 unhone kaha ki dhuen se diwali ke dauraan hawa main piem bad jaataa he
 When people come in contact with these pollutants they may have eye, nose and throat problems
 pataakhon kaa dhuaan, sardi zukam or allergy kaa kararan ban saktaa he or is kaaran chaati va gale main kanjeshan bhi ho saktaa he
 Asked what types of gases are produced by the burning of firecrackers? Dr
 agarwal ne kaha ki diwali ke dauraan pataakhon ke kaaran hawa main pradooshan bad jaataa he
 Dust particles deposit copper, zinc, sodium, lead, magnesium, cadmium, sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxides
 in gaison ke hanikaarak prabhaav hote hai
 In this, copper causes respiratory problems, cadmium-less ability of blood to carry oxygen, due to which the person can be the victim of anemia
 zinc kii vajah se ulti va bukhaar va lead se tantrika pranali ko nuksaan pahunchataa he
 Magnesium and sodium are also harmful for health
 diwali ke dauraan pataakhon va pradooshan ko lekar biimaar vyaktiyon ko kya saavdhaanee baratani chahie? is par dow
 Aggarwal says that young children, elderly and sick people should protect themselves
 dil ke marijon ko bhi pataakhon se bachakar rahanaa chahie
 Their lungs are very delicate
 kai baar bujurg or biimaar vyakti pataakhon ke shor ke kaaran dil ke daure kaa shikaar ho jate hai
 Some people may even die due to shock
 chote bachche, maasoom jaanavar or pakshi bhi pataakhon kii tej aawaaj se dar jate hai
 Fireworks are dangerous for sick people, children and senior citizens
 yah puche jane par ki pataakhe aawaaj or dhuaan bhi paidaa karte hai? inase dhwani pradooshan hota he, isse bachane ke liye kya karnaa chahie? is par agarwal kehete hai ki shor kaa manushya ke swasthya par bura asar padataa he
 Noise or sound spreads through the air
 ise decible main napa jaataa he
 Experts say that voice over 100 decibels has a bad effect on our hearing
 vishwa swasthya sanghathan ke anusaar shaharon ke liye 45 decible kii aawaaj anukool he
 But the noise level in large cities of India is more than 90 decibels
 manushya ke liye uchit str 85 decible tak hi mana gaya he
 Unwanted voice produces psychological effects on humans
 unhone kaha ki shor tanaav, avsaad, ucch raktapchaap, sunne main pareshaani, tinnitos, neend main pareshaani aadi kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Stress and high blood pressure are fatal to health, while tinnitus can cause a person's memory to become depressed / depression
 zyada shor dil kii sehat ke liye acha nahin
 Living in noise increases the blood pressure by five to ten times and increases stress
 ye sabhi kaarak ucch raktchaap or coronary artery rogon kaa kaaran ban sakate hai
 In such a situation what precautions should be taken to avoid firecrackers and pollution during Diwali? On this question, Dr
 agarwal ne kaha ki koshish rahe ki pataakhen na jalaaen yaa kam pataakhe phoden
 Burning of firecrackers emits gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and sulfur oxide which are dangerous for asthma patients
 hawa main maujuuda dhuna bacchon or bujurgon ke liye ghaatak ho saktaa he
 He advised to avoid polluted air, as it can cause stress and allergies
 allergy se bachane ke liye apane munh ko roomaal yaa kapade se dhak len
 Asthma etc
 keep your inhaler with you
 agar aapako saans lene main pareshaani ho to turant iskaa istemaal karen or iske baad doctor kii salaah len
 Adopt a healthy lifestyle during festivals
 agar aapako kisi tarah asahajata mahasoos ho to turant doctor kii salaah len

 Many common people coming to the 'temple of democracy' had to go back empty-stomach, because there is a problem of holiday notes in the canteen, and the number of such people has increased significantly after demonetisation
 lekin khaane-pine ke liye chuttay paison or nakadi kii dikkat sirf aam logon ko nahin he
 Congress MP Raj Babbar said that he had to borrow 100 rupees from his driver so that he could drink tea in the canteen of Parliament
 yahi haal swaagat kaksh main bane bikri countaron kaa bhi tha, jahaan se log sansad kii yaadon se judi chizein or kitaaben karidate hai

 congress saansad raaj babbar ne bataaya ki unhen apane driver se 100 rupee udhaar lene pade, taaki vah sansad kii canteen main chaay pi saken
 The same was the case with the sales counters in the reception room, from where people buy items and books related to the memories of Parliament

 Apart from this, long lines are being installed in the atms in the Parliament House complex

 But last year, one of his acquaintances was also murdered in the Aman Vihar area during Diwali
 jisamen mritak aashaaram gavaah tha
 In such a situation, the family feels that perhaps it is because of that that they have been murdered
 jis vakt aashaaram ko goli maari gai, us vakt unki patni karwachouth kii puja kar rahi thi
 But what they knew was that on the day of Karvachauth their honeymoon would be destroyed

 What is the rationale of the lenders? Other members of the Joint Lending Forum (JLF) with the Indian State Bank (SBI) said that they have the right to maintain the trust account and its maintenance under the RBI guidelines
 is khate main company ko mila rifund jamaa he
 Advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul, appearing for SBI, said in support of JLF that JLF cannot be held responsible for not recovering Rs 37,000 crore from the sale of rcom's assets
 unhone kaha ki jeeyo ke arcom kaa pichhlaa karj chukaane se inkaar karne kii vajah se maamle kaa samaadhaan nahin ho sakaa

 The Crime Branch of the Mumbai Police questioned him for two and a half hours and then arrested him
 giraftaar kaa puraa sikwel kisi drame se kam nahin tha
 The Mumbai Police was unwilling to give much time to Meiyappan, who is seen as a Gurughantal of betting, so the pressure increased and Gurunath had to kneel
 puraa ghatnakram kuch yun rahaa--shaam 5 baje mayppan apni car main chaar logon ke saath kodeikanal se madurai ke liye ravaanaa hue
 - To dodge the media waiting at Madurai Airport, he changed his car and entered the airport

 Overall, all the players exposed in the betting and fixing investigations so far have been caught

 Many institutions of the state have questioned the central government that if they provide food to less than five thousand people in a month, will it not come under the purview of human service
 in sansthaaon ne modi sarkaar par aarope lagaaya ki usne maanav seva kaa bhi meter bana liyaahai
 In fact, recently, the central government has given relief in the GST to religious institutions feeding free food to more than 5 thousand people per month
 aisi sansthaaon ko lungar or prasad main lagane vaala GST rifund kiya jayega
 When religious institutions were also brought under the purview of GST in July last year, the officials associated with the Golden Temple in Amritsar demanded that they provide free food to thousands of devotees daily

 He says he used to love tennis even before his marriage to Sania, but now it has led to a close relationship with the heart

 magar siddhu apni baat kehane se nahin chukte
 It is said that our goal is to make Rahul Gandhi the Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri ko chup karwaane ke liye 85 reliyaan kar chukaa hum

 koi purti kii ho?unhone kaha ki modi ji us nai dulhan kii tarah hai jo chudiyaan to bahut khanakaati hai, lekin roti bahut kam belati hai
 Modi ji should not say that all the planes will run on the road and do not catch the radar
 yahi modi he jo kahata tha hawaii chappal vaale ko hawaii jahaaz main chadha duungaa ab plane vaala banda hawaii chappal main aa gaya
 Sidhu speaks openly against the Prime Minister and is therefore very popular among Congressmen
 siddhu ne aage kaha ki ambani, adani ko karodon kaa contract dilavaate ho
 The farmer goes to jail
 
 Modi ji feels that black money is sitting hidden in a trunk
 
 But when Sidhu was asked who he would contest in Punjab from the akali-bjp or the Aam Aadmi Party
 
 
 ye to capten sahab bataaenge
 He is Captain
 vahi bataaenge
 
 to kya aapako captain ne chup kara diya gaya to kehete hai ki mujhe chup nahin karavaaya gaya
 Which party says
 
 i do captain sahab ne kaha he ki 13 seat jeet rahe hai to hathi ke paanv main sabakaa paanv
 
 
 Obviously no one can win speaking to Sidhu, so he is in great demand
 magar unki naaraazgi us vakt se jab unki patni navjot cor ko chandigarh se tikat naa dekar pawan bansal ko de diya gaya or iskaa izhaar wo gaahe bagaahe karne se nahin chukte
 Yes, they do not leave any chance to please the Congress high command, so always talk of making Rahul Gandhi the Prime Minister

 maharashtra kii sangli loksabhaa seat se 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main 12 ummidavaar chunaav maidan main utre hai
 While its current MP from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been nominated as its candidate Sanjay Ramchandra Patil, this time the Congress has given the Sangli Lok Sabha seat to its partner Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan (SSS)
 swabhimani paksh kii ore se vishaal prakashrav chunaav ladenge
 On the other hand, Shankar Martand from Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Gopichand Kundalik Palkar from Bahujan Aghadi and Rajendra Namdev from Bahujan Mukti Morcha
 vahiin 2019 ke chunaav main sangli loksabhaa seat se 6 nirdaleey pratyaashee bhi chunaav lard rahe hai
 a total of 48 seats in Maharashtra will go to polls in four phases in the Lok Sabha elections
 jisamen tisare charan main rajya kii14 loksabhaa siton par vot daale jaaenge
 These include Jalgaon, Raver, Jalna, Aurangabad, Raigad, Pune, Baramati, Ahmednagar, Madha, Sangli, Satara, ratnagiri-sindhudurg, Kolhapur and Hatkanangale seats on May 23 under the third phase
 itihaas kii baat karen to sangli loksabhaa seat par lambey samay tak congress kaa varchasv kaayam rahaa
 Between 1962 and 2014, this seat was ruled by the Congress for 52 years
 yahaan tak ki apatkaal ke baad jab congress ke bure din the tab bhi is seat se congress pratyaashee ko hi jeet mili
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Modi wave had such an effect that the electoral equation itself changed and bjp's Sanjay Patil won
 unhen 6,11,563 vot mili to vahiin congress ke pratik patil ko 3,72,271 vot mili
 In such a situation, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the challenge before the BJP is to maintain its seat
 bataa den ki sanjay patil ne apana raajnneetik kariyar yuva congress ke jila adhyaksh ke rup main shuru kiya tha
 However, before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he left the Congress and joined the BJP
 sangli loksabhaa seat ke antargat 6 vidhansabha seat aati hai
 There are mlas from Miraj, Sangli, BJP in Jath, Shiv Sena in Khanpur, Congress in Falus Kadegaon and tasgaon-kawathe Mahakal

 To stay updated with the latest news of the general election, subscribe to the Election News Special Newsletter mashhoor singer sonu nigam somvaar ko agenda aaj tak kaarykram main shirkat karne pahunche
 Here they discussed different issues
 sonu ne mitu campan, laudspikar vivaad, pakistani gayakon or twitor chhodane jaise muddon par baatcheet kii
 He said, "I could not get much opportunity to talk about it
" main gavaah hum kai logon kaa ki apni power kaa nazaij phayda uthaaya he
 "he said," i took up the case of Meitu ten years ago when i said that a journalist was harassing me
 main uskaa yahaan naam nahin luungaa
 He had told a director anyway that don't work with Sonu Nigam or else i will die
 wo nirdeshak bhi bolta he ki main aapke saath kaam nahin kar saktaa hum kyonki wo mar jayega
 "sonu Nigam told that" This morning i met Anu Malik
 ye kaha tak jaij he
 You made allegations without proof
 chaliye jaij he
 He can speak a lot if he wants
 lekin nahin bolaa usne
 If i say that you have done a bad job with me, then you will say that you show proof
 pruf to nahin he na
 Even after that, we are giving respect to those allegations
 unka naam kharaab kar rahe hai
 "that's why Twitter left," he said, "I keep my life very pure
 main jivan main kisi par nirbhar nahin hum
 i have learned many things from my life
 ye bhi ki kahin bhi negativity ho vahaan apane aap ko na jhonko
 a place where any donkey gives you knowledge
 isliye main aisi jagahon par nahin dikhataa hum
 Where people look negative i leave
 twitor par jo log hote hai wo 'gatarity' hoti he
 Twitter's fault is not in this
 darasal, bandar ke haath main bandook lag gai he
 People justify there in the name of right to speak
 koi celibrity ne ssailing mistek kar di to log sunaane lag jate hai
 And you abuse this is aloud
 "phanne khan ke liye manaa kar diya thounhone bataaya, "tab ham nae nae aae the
 Then it was necessary for us to do this song
 tii siries ke gulshan kumaar kehete the tu ye gaanaa gale gale tu ye kar de
 But now the remix song does not look good
 haal hi main phanne khan ke liye anil kapur ne "badan pe sitare" ke liye mujhe approach kiya to maine unase kaha, ab mujhe aise gaanaa acha nahin lagata
 Rafi is my master
 ustad kaa gaanaa main gaau
 i should not do this
 tab anil ji ne mujhase kaha, ye gaanaa mere kairactor kaa gaanaa he
 And the character is a big fan of Rafi Sahab
 jab maine ise samajha tab maine gaanaa gaaya
 But i am not in favor of a remix
 main sochataa hum ki ye zyada nahin hona chahie
 "which is the most favorite song of Rafi" My parents introduced me to Rafi Sahab
 mere parents ne rafi, kishor kumaar, lata mangeshkar, mukesh, manna de jaise tamaam singrs se mujhe milwaaya
 We did not make the mistake that fruits are very good and fruits are bad
 hamane sabko suna or sabase kuch na kuch siikhaa
 That's how i grew up
 meri jindagi main ek bhi gaanaa aisa nahin hoga jisamen maine sahagal sahab se lekar rafi sahab tak ko yaad nahin kiya ho
 "" Man should never take a round lightly
 har daur ke log apane se baad vaale ko kehete hai ki ye kya kar rahaa he yaar, hamaare daur main aisa tha
 All the singers are still coming good
 wo bahut behatar hai
 The album is over in this period but singles are coming
 lekin ye maahaul aisa bhi he jab tamaam nai chijen bhi aa gai hai
 "which was the first song that went superhit" i didn't get anything overnight
 bevafa sanam album thi
 She was a hit
 uske baad film ai
 Hosted on TV
 saaregamapa
 Then messages come
 phir ye dil divaana
 
 
 Then came many songs and films
 step bai step hota rahaa ye sab
 Nothing happened overnight
 bhagwaan mujhe taiyaar karata rahaa ki tere ko jatke se nahin duungaa
 i will give you step by step
 "kyon nahin ban rahe achche gane"ham majaak main kehete hai ki kaash ham pakistan main paidaa hue hote
 i am saying, find out the fact
 yahi kaaran he ki mujeec aapke mutabik nahin aa rahe hai or rimix par rimix aa rahe hai
 The first music producers, directors and composers
 ab companiyaan gaanaa bana rahi hai
 But in such a song will not be made
 yaad karne vaale gane nahin banenge
 If the song becomes good then it goes on for twenty five years
 "kariyar ke shuruaati dinon par"vastav main ye safar meraa akele kaa nahin he
 It has also been a visit to my parents
 mere papa abhi bhi badhiya gaate hai
 The mother has passed away, she also used to sing
 main chaar saal se apni marji se ga rahaa hum
 i was fond of studies
 khilne kaa shauk tha
 i started singing with a hobby
 main bas stop par bhi khadaa rahata tha to sur lagaataa tha
 i did not waste time
 main abhi bhi kaam karata hum
 Some people supported and some even protested
 aisa hota he
 i found myself, so my journey was better
 "kyon ban rahe hai rimix?"kabhi-kabhi lagata he ki yadi ham pakistan se hote to acha hota
 Because we would have found work in India
 ab aisa ho gaya he ki singrs ko mujeec companiyon ko paise dene padate hai apane shoj ke liye
 If you do not give them money, they will not play your song
 wo gaanaa aapako dilavaayenge hi nahin
 They will do that by getting their singers to sing and then they will make that singer bigger and then take money from him for the song
 ""ve aisa pakistani singrs ke saath aisa nahin karte hai
 It is good that they do not do this with them
 lekin yadi aisa hi he to aap bhartiya gayakon ke saath bhi aisa kyon kar rahe ho? aatif asalam meraa acha dost he
 You don't tell him to give me money for shows
 raahat ko nahin bolaa jaataa ki aao hamaare yahaan gaanaa gaao or paise dena hamako
 This business has reversed
 aap puch lenaa industry main ki jo main kah rahaa hum usamen kitna sach he
 This is why new songs are not coming
 or rimix par rimix aae ja rahe hai
 The first directors, producers, singers composed music
 aaj kal mujeec companiyaan mujeec bana rahi hai
 Your work comes to you
 aap use behatar kar sakate ho
 What knowledge can i give you? "ajaan band ho gai, ab neend aati he"aap ajaan na kahen, baat ajaan kii nahin laudspikar kii he
 You too have spoiled this Ajan by speaking
 laudspikar par agar aap meri maa kii lori bhi chalaayenge to mujhe bura lagegaa
 We should follow the rules
 kisi bhi achche or susanskrit desh main niyamon kaa paalan kiya jaataa he
 It is no longer in the air that we will show by doing, we will show by breaking

 bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi once again refused to apologize for the Gujarat riots, and said that if the allegations against him are even a little truthful, he should be hanged publicly
 modi ne kaha ki maafee maangane se koi makasad puraa nahin hoga kyonki aise aaropon se nipatane ke liye yah sahi rasta nahin he
 Modi was asked to apologize for the post-godhra riots in which more than 1000 people were killed
 modi ne kaha, ‘mujhe yakeen he ki agar in aaropon main ratti bhar bhi sachai he to main mahasoos karata hum ki bharat ke ujjwal bhavishya or parampara ke liye modi ko chauraahey par faansee par chadha dena chahie
 The punishment should be such that no one has the courage to commit such a crime in the coming 100 years
 'cheentee bhi marati he to dard hota haieenai par prasaarit intervyuu main modi ne kaha, ‘agar maine koi aparaadh kiya he, to modi ko maaf nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Forgive people after apologizing, what is this arrangement? Should not apologize
 modi ko kabhi maaf nahin kiya janaa chahie
 He said that if he had lost the elections of 2002 or 2007, there would have been no question of apology
 ek choti si mandali he jo samajhati he ki unhone kadi mehnat karke tufaan khadaa kar diya he
 But Modi did not lose, did not die
 yah unka junun he ki modi ko giraanaa he
 Asked about the controversy over his 'dog-boy' remarks regarding the killing of 'muslims', Modi said that if an ant also dies, it hurts
 unhone kaha, ‘iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki main mritak kii tulana cheentee se kar rahaa hum
 There is a difference between different language and expression in India
 ’ unhone kaha ki unki tippanee kii galat vyakhya kii gai vaisaa unka iraadaa nahin tha
 a few years ago when asked about his refusal to wear a round cap during the Sadbhavna fast, Modi said that he followed his own tradition and respected the traditions of others
 gol topi uchhaalega, to bardaasht nahimbijapi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ne kaha, ‘main tushtikaran kii niti ke khilaaf hum
 i will never adopt a symbol of appeasement, but if someone tosses a round cap, i will not tolerate it
 aisi sajaa di jaani chahie jo misaal ho
 When asked about his recent remarks related to the imprisonment of mlas and mps facing trial, Narendra Modi said that criminalization of politics is a serious issue
 unhone kaha ki agar satta main aae, to aise vidhayak evam saansad jinke khilaaf aapraadhik maamle lambit he, unke liye vah supreme court se vishesh adaalat gathit karne or ek saal main faisla sunaane kaa aagrah karenge
 Modi said that those who are convicted, their seats will be vacant and their place will be filled with people facing criminal charges
 bijepi netaa ne kaha, ‘har koi yah baat kahata he lekin koi karata nahin he
 But i have decided to do so
 lekin agar koi or behatar rasta he to main us par bhi vichaar karuunga
 i do not want cases against politicians to be dragged on for long
 ’ unhone haalanki spasht kiya ki vah badale kii bhaavana se koi kaam nahin karenge or apana samay evam urja logon kii bhalaai ke kaam main lagaayenge

 is baar badi sankhya main shraddhalu chaar dham yatra main umad rahe hai
 But in a month, 44 pilgrims who have visited this yatra have died
 pehle hi maheene main 44 mautein hone se behatar swasthya suvidhaayen dene kaa dam bharne vaale swasthya vibhaag par sawalia nishaan khadey ho rahe hai
 This time a record-breaking number of travelers are coming to Chardham, with the maximum turning towards Badrinath and Kedarnath
 amuman badrinaath main yatriyon kii sankhya zyada hoti thi par is baar kedarnath main badi sankhya main log aae hai
 While more than five lakh devotees have reached Badrinath in a month, this time in Kedarnath also this figure is almost equal
 yatra shuru hone se pehle swasthya vibhaag ne yatriyon ke liye behatar swasthya suvidhaayen muhaiyaa karaane kii baat kahi thi, lekin yatra kii shuruyaat main hi dur pradeshon se aae 44 logon kii maut ho chuki he
 In this case, when asked to the Director General of Health Uttarakhand, they say that better arrangements have been made by the government to ensure that there is no inconvenience in the journey
 saath hi yatriyon ko swasthya suvidhaayen bhi muhaiyaa karai ja rahi hai
 According to the Director General of Health, Dr
 Ravindra Thapliyal, so far 71 thousand people have been given treatment in the Health Post
 logon ke upachaar ke liye nurse or doctor tainaat hai or apni duty kar rahe hai
 Due to the frequent deaths of passengers, the health department's arrangements are bound to raise questions
 haalanki is maamle par swasthya mahanideshak kii maane to 44 shraddhaluon kii maut main se lagbhag 27 kii maut heart atake ke kaaran hui he or anya kii maut alag-alag kaarnon se hui he
 But somewhere the lack of oxygen at altitude is a big reason
 devbhumi uttarakhand kii chardhaam yatra main darshan karne aaye shradaaluon kaa pehle hi maheene main 44 mauton kaa aankada chaunkaane vaala he
 It is an important responsibility of the Health Department to provide better facilities and provide timely treatment
 lekin maut ke aankade kuch or hi bayaan kar rahe hai
 When Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was asked a question about the cabinet expansion, he gave an old answer this time too

 In response, Singh said, "as far as the monsoon session and the cabinet reshuffle are concerned, i feel that this press conference is not the right place to announce a reshuffle in the cabinet
" jab bhi aisa kiya jayega to aapako pataa chal jayega

" aam aadmi party ne dilli congress pradesh adhyaksh ajay maakan ke sisitivi tender main gadabadi ke aaropon ko jhootha bataaya he
 While clarifying on the tender process of CCTV by the Delhi government, the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claimed that soon the government will put the information in front of the cabinet to install CCTV in the city
 aam aadmi party ke dilli sanyojak or mantri gopal raay ne bataaya kisschhouko lekar ajay maakan ne jhooth bolaa he
 Gopal Rai gave detailed information about the CCTV tender process
 unhone bataaya ki tender do prakaar ke hote hai, rate contract tender or doosraa project contract tender
 The cost of a camera is estimated in the rate contract tender
 jaise-jaise camaron ke sankhya badhati he kul laagat bhi badhati jaati he
 The cameras that the Delhi government is going to install are under the rate contract tender
 gopal raay ne aage kaha ki, jahaan tak sharton ko aasaan karne kii baat he to main bataa duun ki pehali baar jab tender nikaala gaya to do companiyon ne aavedan diya
 The more skilled (expert) companies should apply in this, thinking that the tender was withdrawn again
 lekin duusari baar bhi keval unheen do companiyon ne aavedan kiya
 One of those two companies was a private company and the other was Bharat Electronics Limited Company of the Central Government
 chunki sarkari company kii anumaanit laagat privet company kii anumaanit laagat se kam thi, to hamane centre sarkaar kii bharat electronics limited ko chunaa
 He said that i want to ask Ajay Maken Ji, where and how did the scam happen when the work has not started yet? In addition, Gopal Rai also asked Ajay Maken 5 questions
 CCTV camere kaa kaam rokane ke shadyantr main ajay maakan kyon shaamil hai?2
 What did Ajay Maken gain by stopping the work of Mohalla Clinic in the name of the so-called scam? 3
 ajay maakan ne cabinet ke apruval na dene kaa jhooth kyon bolaa?4
 How many CCTV cameras did Congress put in 15 years of government? 5
 ajay maakan ke sansadeey kshetra nai dilli main nirbhaya cese hua tha
 What did Ajay Maken do for women's safety while an MP? At that time, the Congress government was in both the Center and Delhi
 gopal raay ne aarope lagaate hue kaha ki 'bijepi dilli kii janata se apni haar kaa badla le rahi he
 The Deputy Governor has been obstructing all the work of the Delhi Government at the behest of the Center
 lekin dilli congress ke pradesh adhyaksh ajay maakan kyon dilli kii janata ke hit ke kaaryon main hameshaa baadha paidaa karte hai
 This matter has not been understood till date
 kahin ajay maakan ji ne bhaajapa main jane kii taiyaari to nahin kar lee he?’ When the Kapil Dev-led Indian team became world champion in 1983, it received a prize money of only 20,000 pounds, but if Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team becomes the World Cup winner in 2011, it will get almost 90 times more prize money
 antarrashtriya cricket parishad ne 19 farvari se do april tak bharat, srilanka or bangladesh main chalane vaale cricket mahakumbh ke liye pichley vishwa cap kii tulana main lagbhag doguni puraskaar raashi rakhi he
 The team to become champions in this tournament will get a prize money of 3 million dollars (about 18 lakh 74 thousand pounds or 13 crore 67 lakh rupees)
 alam yah he ki is baar pehle daur main jeet darj karne vaali team ko bhi 60 hajaar dollars(lagbhag 27 lakh rupee) mil jaaenge jo 1987 main pehali baar champion bani austrailian team ko mili puraskaar raashi(30 hajaar pound) se adhik he
 This time, whichever team reaches the quarter-finals, it is set to get three lakh 70 thousand dollars (about one crore 68 lakh rupees)
 isi tarah se semifinal main haarane vaali team ko 750,000 dollars yani teen karod 41 lakh rupee tathaa final main parajeet hone vaali team ko ek karod 50 hajaar dollars yani chah karod 83 lakh rupee milenge jo ki pichley sabhi vishwa cap kii tulana main sabase badi puraskaar raashi he
 But Sourav Ganguly's team only got eight lakh dollars in 2003 when they were runners-up, while champions Australia got two million dollars
 iske chaar saal baad westeindies main hue vishwa cap main yah raashi badhaakar 22 lakh 40 hajaar dollars kar di gayi
 Ricky Ponting's team also became champions last time, while the runners-up Sri Lankan team received one million dollars
 bhartiya team 1983 main jab champion bani thi to cricket board ke paas bhi khilaadiyon ko dene ke liye paisa nahin tha
 In the end, Lata Mangeshkar's concert was organized to collect money, from which each player of the champion team got one lakh rupees

 After winning the election, the Gehlot government announced to waive off the loans of the farmers of the co-operative banks, but the government has no money to give them to the banks
 lihaaja bainkon ke paas paise nahin hone se kisaanon ko nae lone nahin mil paa rahe hai
 The sowing of crops has ended, but the government is busy running to raise money
 jila colectoron ne to yahaan tak kah diya he ki sarkaar agar kisaanon ke lone kaa intjaam nahin karti he, to kanoon-vyavastha kii samasya paidaa ho sakati he
 Farmers in Phagi's co-operative society in Jaipur district are making rounds for loans, but farmers are not getting loans
 ko-oparative bainkon ke paas paise nahin bache hai jo kisaanon ko baant sake
 The farmer needs money to sow jowar, millet, moong and pulses crops, but even after two months the government has not been able to raise money
 jaipur jile main 600 karod ke lone dene the magar sarkaar 232 karod hi jugad kar pai he
 There is a lot of resentment among the farmers
 phaagi ke kisaan brijmohan sharma ne kaha ki mung lagane ke liye beej khaad ke liye 50 hajaar lone ke liye applai kiya tha magar nahin mila
 At the same time, farmer Govind Narayan says that my 20 thousand loans were forgiven, but this time have not been received, they say that the money did not come from above
 is sijan main kisaan ko dene the 5 hajaar karodrajasthan sarkaar ko is sijan ke fasal ke liye kisaanon ko dene ke liye 5 hajaar karod rupee chahie tha, lekin do maheene baad bhi sabhi sansthaanon se lone lene ke baavjood 2 hajaar karod se jya paise nahin juta pai
 In fact, Rahul Gandhi had announced that if the debt of farmers is not waived within 10 days after forming the government, the Chief Minister will change
 ise dekhte hue rajasthan sarkaar ne ko-oparative bainkon ke 83 hajaar karod ke kisaanon ke karj maafee kii ghoshnaa kar di magar ko-oparative bainkon ko die kuch bhi nahin
 The chairman of Fagi Co-operative Bank, Om Sharma, says that the government has forgiven loans without thinking and the co-operative banks did not get the money
 naabard se 200 karod aae bhi to central ko-oparative bank ne apane lone maafee kaa hissaa kaa 100 karod pehle rakh liya
 372 in Bikaner
 5 karod main se 54 karod, ajmer main 536
 75 crores out of 44, 451 in Bharatpur
 28 karod main se 54
 98 crores, 708 in Churu
 55 main se 81
 11 crores, 566 at Jalore
 76 karod main se 53
 Only 62 crore has been distributed
 jabaki ab fasal taiyaar hone ko aa gai he
 Up to 2 lakh farmers had been loaned
 In view of the exclusion of loan waiver by former President of Mafcongress Rahul Gandhi, Vasundhara Raje had waived loans of up to 50 thousand farmers of the Co-operative Society before the elections
 congress sarkaar ne satta main aane ke baad rahul gandhi kaa vaada nibhaane ke liye 2 lakh tak ke kisaanon ke lone maaf kar die
 Now the government is saying that we are trying and the opposition is saying that farmers are not getting loans on time
 sarkaar kah rahi he ki hamane 2600 karod kaa lone kisaanon ko dene ke liye liya he, ab ise baanta ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, private and government banks have refused to forgive the loans of the farmers, saying that we will forgive the loans of the farmers only after the state government first pays the farmers money
 esbiai ke chairman se hamane poocha to saaf kar diya ki kisaanon ke lone maaf karnaa koi samaadhaan nahin he
 SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar, who came to Jaipur, said that successive governments come and forgive the loan
 ab vakt aa gaya he ki ham is baat par vichaar karen ki ye yojana kisaanon ko phayda de rahaa he ki nahin
 District collectors have asked the government to make quick arrangements for loans of farmers or else law and order problems will occur
 samasya ye ho gai he ki sarkaar ke lone maafee kii ghoshnaa ko dekhte hue sarkari or nijee bank kisaanon ko lone de nahin paa rahe hai or ko-oparative bank ke paas itane paise nahin ki lone baant sake
 In the midst of all this, the farmers are saying that it was better than before the Lonamafi
 pradooshan kii maar jhel rahi desh kii rajdhani main behad khubsuurati se diwali kaa tyohaar manaaya ja rahaa he
 The team of 'aaj Tak' interacted with a family who have not completely said firecrackers this Diwali
 dilachasp baat he ki ye parivaar or unke padosi pichley kuch saalon tak diwali kii raat jamkar aatishbaazi karte the lekin is parivaar ne badhate pradooshan or zahreeli hawa ke khilaaf ek sankalp liya he
 Devi, studying in class VIII, says that before Diwali the school was made aware through street street plays about how dangerous the firecracker pollution is for health
 pataakhon se dhwani pradooshan bhi kaaphi hota he, isliye mummy-papa ko is saal pataakhe kharidne se manaa kiya he
 Devi appealed to the Delhiites, saying that Diwali is not a festival of diyas but of firecrackers
 aise main log roshni kaa zindagi main swaagat karen or pataakhe phodne kii galat pratha ko vidaa karen
 In this campaign, the goddess has got the support of the family
 devi kii maa meghna ne bataaya ki pradooshan badhane ke saath hi unke parivaar main jaagrukta kaaphi bad gai he
 Meghna is very happy with the firecrackers not burning in the neighborhood
 unhone kaha ki '2 saal pehle tak hamaara parivaar or padosi kaaphi pataakhe phodte the lekin ab pradooshan itnaa he ki saans lene main mushkil hoti he
 It is a matter of happiness that firecrackers are no longer burst in our colony, but lamps are burnt
 'devi ke pados main rahane vaali nargis bataati hai ki ghar par pataakhon par puri tarah pratibandh laga diya gaya he
 Nargis expressed concern over the increasing pollution, saying that 'after Diwali last year the pollution was so high that the front building was not visible
 is saal hamane pataakhe kharidne ke liye ghar par saaf manaa kar diya he ki unke ghar main ek kutta bhi he jo pataakhon kii aawaaj sunakar dar jaataa he
 However, when the family and neighbors were asked how they would celebrate Diwali without firecrackers, they got very interesting answers
 parivaar ke sadasyon ne kaha ki diwali pataakhon kaa tyohaar he
 It is a festival of meeting each other, a festival of sweetness, not of pollution
 aise main wo pataakhen phodne kii bajaay rangoli banaakar, parivaar ke saath vakt bitaakar diwali kaa tyohaar manaayenge
 Let us tell you that every year in Delhi, the level of pollution suddenly increases during the winter season
 saath hi diwali ke dauraan jalaae jane vaale pataakhon kii vajah se hawa kai guna jahrili bhi ho jaati he
 In such a situation, the Supreme Court has allowed the bursting of green firecrackers from 8 pm to 10 pm
 haalanki log badhate pradooshan ko dekhte hue ab pataakhon se kinaaraa bhi kar rahe hai
 As seen in the episodes of 'khatron Ke Khiladi', the same seriousness and fear do not always remain on the set
