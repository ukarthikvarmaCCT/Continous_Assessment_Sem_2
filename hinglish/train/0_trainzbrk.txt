 From time to time many speculations surfaced about his mysterious death
 - 20 july 1921 mensubhash chandra bosaki mulaakaat pehali baar mahatmagandhiji hui
 On the advice of Gandhiji, he started working for the Indian freedom struggle
 bharat kii aazaadee ke saath-saath unka judaav saamaajik kaaryon main bhi bana rahaa

 The England team has suffered a major setback before the Ashes series begins
 england ke tej gendbaaj steven fin ghutane kii chot ke kaaran ashes siries ke shuruaati do muqablon se baahar ho gaye hai
 Finn suffered a knee injury while batting during practice on the first day in Perth
 unhen us samay chot se ubarne ke liye igenction diya gaya tha
 However, his injury has not yet been recovered

 Finn was selected in the team in his place
 haalanki fin ke vikalp kii ghoshnaa abhi tak nahin kii gai he
 Toby Roland Jones is also out of the England squad due to injury
 koun legaa fin kii jagah?chotil fin kii jagah koun legaa is par maathapi shuru ho chuki he
 Middlesex fast bowler Liam Plunkett is leading in this race, playing in Bangladesh Premier League
 unhone haal hi main england ke liye shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 Plunkett has played only two first class matches in 2017
 ashes siries kaa pehla test 23 seeshes siries kaa pehla match 23 november ko brisben main khelaa jayega
 It is expected that Finn will return to the field after two matches
 28 saal ke fin ne ab tak apane international kariyar main 36 test main 125 wicket, 69 vanade main 102 wicket or 21 tii-20 main 27 wicket liye hai
 Team India have an upper hand in the final match played between India and South Africa in Cape Town
 teen maichon kii siries main jeet ke saath shuruyaat karne vaali kohli and company ko duusare mukaable main bhale hi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa ho, lekin tisare vanade main team jeet kii prabal daavedaar he
 Indian batsmen have maintained their form in odis as well as in T20 matches and once again they are expected to score big in the third match
 shanivaar ko khele jane vaale tisare or antim match ne 'final' jaisi haisiyat hasil kar lee he or ise jeetne ke liye donon tiimon ke bich match romaanchak hone ja rahaa he
 In the three T20 matches series, both teams are 1–1 and the result of the third match will be announced by the winning team of the series
 bhartiya ballebaajon kaa shandaar pradarshnakptain viraat kohli kii aguwai main sheersh kram ke ballebaajon ne shandaar pradarshan kiya he
 While Shikhar Dhawan has shown consistency in Virat Kohli's performance, the middle order batsmen have contributed significantly in the last match
 pehle donon muqablon main raina ne bhi choti lekin mahatvapurn paariyaan kheli hai
 In the third T20 match between them all will be on the eye of Captain Kohli, who is constantly running in form
 kohli ko tii-20 international main apane 2000 ran puure karne ke liye 20 se bhi kam ranon kii jarurat he
 The Indian team knows that if they win this match, they have a golden opportunity to return home with 1 Test win, 1 ODI series and 1 T20 series win
 lihaaja team india koi kasar nahin chhodana chaahegi
 The bowlers of Team India are full of confidence where the bowlers are in question, then the team has players like Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Shardul Thakur, Jaydev Unadkat, Hardik Pandya and Yuzvendra Chahal, which can make it difficult for the South African batsmen
 team india ke gendbaaj south africa daure kii shuruyaat se hi aatmavishvaas se labarej hai
 The bowlers have taken wickets on important occasions and have given success to their team
 africa ballebaaj kuchhek maukon ko chhod bhartiya spinneron se nipatane main asafal rahe hai
 Yajuvendra Chahal may have proved expensive in the second T20 match, but it should be kept in mind that bad weather also helped South Africa indirectly
 match ke baad captain viraat kohli ne sweekaar kiya ki barish ke chalate yajuvendra chahal ko gend par grip banane main mushkil ho rahi thi or yahi vajah thi ki ve aprabhavi najar aae
 If the weather in Cape Town did not get much worse, playing Indian spinners would not be easy for the African batsmen even in the last match of the tour
 spinneron ke saath tej gendbaajon ne apane pradarshan se kisi tarah kii shikaayat kaa mauka apane chaahane waalon ko nahin diya he
 Let me tell you that it is cloudy in Cape Town and there is a possibility of rain
 agar aisa hota he, to bhartiya team ke phirakibaajon kii chunauti bad jaaegi
 And the hosts will benefit from this
 dabaav main he mejabaan timismen koi do raay nahin he ki tii-20 siries main khel rahi africa team ke paas anubhav kii kami he
 The impact of the team is less visible in front of the Indian team
 iske saath hi 'final' mukaable main sthaneey darshakon ke saamne mejabaan team jeet darj kar 'ant bhala, to sab bhala' kii kahawat ko charitaarth karnaa chaahegi, to jaahir he ki dabaav mejabaan team par hoga
 If the team loses this match, then its forehead will be the stain of two consecutive series defeats
 or ye pachchis saalon ke itihaas main pehali baar hoga
 South Africa do not have Abraham de Villiers, Faf du Plessis and Quinton de Kock, so the team will be doused once again and there will be great expectations from young players like Klassen

 com / 9hg3fthrhq jammu kashmir main hijbul commander burhan vaani ke encounter ke baad bhi ghati ke yuva aatank kii raah par ja rahe hai lekin in bhartiyon kaa link burhan vaani se jarur he
 After the assassination of Burhan on 8 July 2016, more than 35 youth have turned to the terrorist organization Hizbul and a new trend has been found behind their recruitment
 angreji akhbaar indian express main chhapi khabar ke mutabik burhan encounter ke baad hijbul main shaamil hue in yuvaaon ke bare main unke parijanon, mitron se judi jaankaree jutaney par yah pataa chalata he ki vah kisi ne kisi rup main burhan kii maut prabhavit the
 The newspaper's report said that Burhan's death influenced these youths to enter Hizbul
 surakshabalon ke liye yah aatanki koi chunauti ban pate isse pehle hi zyaadaatar kaa encounter kar diya gaya he
 Despite this, new youth are still joining Hizbul
 ek varisht adhikari ne bataaya ki is trend ko jald se jald khatm kiye jane kii jarurat he
 How was recruitment used to recruit young people who had earlier chosen the path of terror in recruitment
 kam baar hi aisa hota tha ki nae bhartee hue yuvaaon ko koi bada mishan diya jaataa tha
 After recruitment, he was given arms training for at least 3 months, sent across the border and after that he would return with bullet ammunition and work on hiding his identity
 aise badal rahaa he trendonbbe ke dashak main aatankwaadi gatividhiyon main kami ai or kisi aatanki ke encounter ke baad pratikriya yaa javaabi hamale bhi kam hue
 This has rarely happened when a terrorist has been given martyr status after his assassination
 burhan shruwaat main pahchaan chhipaakar hi kaam kar rahaa tha lekin baad main usne is trend ko badla or khuleam naam ke saath sabase saamne aayaa
 Through social media, he exposed the name and photo and started a new trend, which is now proving more dangerous than before
 in dinon aatanki sanghathanon main shaamil ho rahe yuva isi trend ko follow kar rahe hai
 Terrorists nowadays share photos or videos on social media with weapons and after this, the family gets to know about it
 inamen se zyaadaatar ko to training bhi nahin mili hoti he
 Even for elephants, they have to depend on weapons looted by police and security forces
 yah kisi khaas mishan ko anjaam dene se pehle kii surakshabalon kii goli kaa shikaar ho jate hai
 Many such examples have been seen in the past, but one example is the most dangerous
 ise bayaan karte hue varisht adhikari kehete hai ki sthaneey log suraksha intjaamon ko bigaadte hai jiskaa phayda uthaakar aatanki apni paith jamaa lete hai
 On the other hand, when the terrorists are surrounded, the local security forces try to stop them
 agar aatanki ko maar diya jaataa he to uske janaaje main shaamil hone ke liye saikadon kii taadaad main gharon se baahar aate hai
 This kind of atmosphere is being created around the terrorist

 gauratlab he ki shashi tharur ne kal congress kii press conference main modi kii tarifon ke pul baandhe the
 However, the Congress has kept itself away from the statements of Shashi Tharoor on this issue

 ' tharur ne jodate hue kaha, 'loktantr main vipaksh kaa kaam rashtriyahit ke liye khadaa hona he, na ki sarkaar ne jo kaha yaa nitiyon kaa virodh karnaa
 ' tharur ne or bhi kaha, 'kuch mudde par modi hi nahin balki unke kuch samarthakon kaa bhi virodh kar chukaa hum
 He has been opposed on issues like Section 370, Common Civil Code
 ' To a question on the Congress party's stance on Modi's praise, Tharoor said, "I am still the spokesperson of the party
" main ye maanata hum ki meri party is baat ko samaj chuki he ki main kya kahana chahta tha
 At the same time, senior Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar criticized party spokesperson Shashi Tharoor for praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, calling his party colleague 'immature' and repeatedly changing his stance
 ayyar ne yah bhi kaha ki vah is baat se 'kaaphi niraash' hai ki tharur jaise 'budhimaan' vyakti is tareeke se nishkarsh par pahunchnaa chaahate hai or aisi tippanee karte hai
 Iyer told NDTV that it is unnecessary to praise in this way only after a few days (after Modi came to power)

 According to sources, at the National Executive meeting in Bengaluru, Nadda was told that the matter should not be prolonged anymore
 party sutron ke mutabik nadda se kaha gaya he ki cigarette ke pakat par sachitr chetavanee kaa aakaar bhi badhaayaa janaa chahie
 It has been made clear that even if this size is not up to 85% as recommended, but a warning should be given on the compartment to 50-60%
 nadda se kaha gaya he ki is maamle ko lanbaa nahin khinchne dena chahie, kyonki isse sarkaar kii chhavi par asar padataa he
 It has also been said that BJP mps should avoid rhetoric in this matter
 aise saansad jinke hiton ke takaraav kaa maamla banataa he, unhen khud hi ye dekhnaa chahie ki wo inase kaise alag ho sakate hai
 Significantly, the Ministry of Health took the initiative in this direction, but a parliamentary committee led by BJP MP Dilip Gandhi has asked for more information on this

 bijepi baar baar ye bhi kahati he ki narendra modi kaa asar sabase zyada desh ke yuvaaon main he
 There has also been much debate on what the retirement age of politicians should be
 congress ne apni sari kaman rahul gandhi ko ye sochakar thamai ki rahul yuvaaon ko apni taraf kheechenge, lekin bijepi ke bade or puraane netaaon par ye baat lagu hi nahin ho paa rahi he
 LK Advani is 86 years 4 months and 12 days old, but the BJP does not know how to deal with LK Advani's issues
 jab bhartiya janata party ko ye baat pataa thi ki modi kii piem ummidavaari kii ghoshnaa ke samay laalkrishna adwani ne kitna drama kiya tha to bijepi aakiri samay tak adwani ke drame kaa intazaar kyon kar rahi thi
 Could Advani's seat not be decided first? chunki bijepi main ritairement kii umr par bahes nahin ho paati, adwani or murali manohar joshi jaise netaaon par pehle faisalaa kyon nahin liya gaya or in netaaon ne bhi dramebaazi main koi kasar nahin chodi
 After all, he made a formal announcement to accept the decision of the party but after the complete political gimmick
 nuksaan kiskaa bijepi kaa jisaki chhavi abhi bhi ye nahin ban paa rahi he ki chunaav se chand din pehle ye party puri tarah se ekajute he or khaaskar murali manohar joshi− laalkrishna adwani jaise puraane or bade netaa narendra modi or rajnath singh ke saath hai

 The statements of several Congress leaders, including Raj Babbar, are not yet over that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has created a new controversy by fixing the strange definition of poverty
 elahabaad ke govind ballab pant saamaajik vigyaan santhaan kaa daawa he ki rahul gandhi ne unke kaarykram main yah bayaan diya he ki garibi sirf ek maansik sthiti yani dimagi haalat he or iskaa khaanaa khaane, rupee or bhautik chizon se koi vaasta nahin he
 According to Rahul Gandhi, unless a person brings confidence in himself, he will not be able to get out of poverty
 rahul gandhi ke is bayaan kaa matlab nikaala jaae to yah saaf he ki agar aapke paas paise nahin hai, thik se pet bharne ke liye khaanaa nahin he or aap bhautik sukh- suvidhaon se bhi dur hai to bhi aap khud ke garib na hone kii galatfahami paalate hue apane ko isse alag rakh sakate hai
 The Govind Ballabh Pant Institute issued a press release on Monday night, claiming to have made such a controversial statement by Rahul Gandhi
 santhaan ne dalit samudaay kii behad pichhadi hui saat jatiyon ke pratinidhiyon se rahul gandhi va duusare congress netaaon ke bich baatcheet or bahes kaa kaarykram somvaar kii shaam ko yojit kiya tha
 Along with Rahul Gandhi, Congress General Secretary Madhusudan Mistry and UP Congress President Nirmal Khatri were also present at the event
 somvaar ko hi elahabaad ke ek anya kaarykram main rahul gandhi ne beemaari ko garibi kii sabase badi vajah bataaya tha
 In this program, Rahul Gandhi said that his government is running all the schemes for the poor
 garibi ko khatm karne ke bhi intjaam kiye ja rahe hai, lekin garibi ko tab tak khatm nahin kiya ja saktaa, jab tak ki garib apane aatmavishvaas or aatmbal ke jariye isse baahar nahin nikalnaa chahega
 People cannot get out of poverty just by providing food and money
 rahul gandhi ke mutabik, kisi ko kuch dekar garibi nahin dur kii ja sakati or na hi uskaa soshal states badla ja saktaa he
 The comments rahul gandhi ne yah baaten elahabaad ke jhunsi ilaake ke govind ballab pant saamaajik vigyaan santhaan ke dalit risource centre dwaara "samskruti- janatantr kaa prasar or ati upekshit samooh" vishyak par yojit karai gai goshtee main kahi

 Representatives of these castes, describing their poverty and social conditions, demanded Rahul Gandhi to do something for himself, in return, the Congress Crown Prince gave him the advice to remove poverty through mental confidence, although in view of the Lok Sabha elections Rahul Gandhi instructed these castes to become active in politics and prepare their representatives
 unhone kaha ki maujuud siyaasi halaat main kam taadaad vaali jatiyon ke log emele jaise bade padon par nahin jeet sakate, lekin panchayat chunaavon main vah apana pradhan jarur chun sakate hai
 He assured these delegates to continue this new relationship far away

 The Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Social Sciences in Allahabad claims that Rahul Gandhi has made a statement in his program that poverty is just a mental state i
e
 a mental state and has nothing to do with food, money and material things
 rahul gandhi ke mutabiq, jab tak koi shaks khud main aatmavishvaas nahin laaegaa, tab tak vah garibi ke makadjaal se baahar nahin nikal paaegaa
 If you mean this statement of Rahul Gandhi, then it is clear that if you do not have money, do not have food to fill your stomach properly and you are far away from physical comforts, you still have the misconception of not being poor
 You can keep yourself apart from it by keeping it
 govind ballab pant santhaan ne somvaar kii raat ko ek press relies jari kar rahul gandhi dwaara is tarah kaa vivaadit bayaan die jane kaa daawa kiya he
 The institute organized a program of interaction and debate between Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders on Monday evening with representatives of the seven backward castes of the Dalit community
 is kaarykram main rahul gandhi ke saath congress mahasachiv madhusudan mistre or upi congress ke adhyaksh nirmal khatri bhi maujuud the
 In another program in Allahabad on Monday itself, Rahul Gandhi had termed the disease as the biggest cause of poverty
 is kaarykram main rahul gandhi ne kaha ki unki sarkaar garibon ke liye tamaam yojanaayen chalaa rahi he
 Arrangements are also being made to eradicate poverty, but poverty cannot be eradicated unless the poor want to get out of it through their confidence and self-confidence
 sirf khaanaa or paisa muhaiyaa ho jane se log garibi se nahin ubar sakate hai
 According to Rahul Gandhi, poverty cannot be eradicated and social status cannot be changed by giving anything to anyone
 tippaniyan Rahul Gandhi said this in a seminar organized by the Dalit Resource Center of Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Institute of Jhunsi area of allahabad on the topic "cultural-spread democracy and highly neglected group"
 rahul gandhi is goshtee main chif guest the
 The seminar also included hundreds of representatives from different parts of Uttar Pradesh, from the highly backward castes of the Dalit community, the Nats - Musahar, Kanjar Dhrikar, Sapera, Chamarmangata and Bansphore etc
 in jatiyon ke pratinidhiyon ne apni garibi or saamaajik halaat ko bayaan karte hue rahul gandhi se apane liye kuch kiye jane kii maang kii to badale main congress ke yuvaraj ne unhen mental confidence ke jariye garibi dur karne kii naseehat de daali, haalanki loksabhaa chunaav ke maddenjar rahul gandhi ne in jatiyon ko siyasat main sakriy hone or apane numaayinde taiyaar karne kii hidaayat di
 He said that in the present political situation, people of lesser number of castes cannot win big positions like MLA, but in Panchayat elections, they can definitely choose their head
 unhone in pratinidhiyon se is nae bane rishte ko dur tak nibhaane kaa bharosa dilaayaa
 No leader of other parties was involved in this conference
 rahul gandhi ke is bayaan kaa matlab nikaala jaae to yah saaf he ki agar aapke paas paise nahin hai, thik se pet bharne ke liye khaanaa nahin he or aap bhautik sukh- suvidhaon se bhi dur hai to bhi aap khud ke garib na hone kii galatfahami paalate hue apane ko isse alag rakh sakate hai

 The Opposition has been very aggressive in the past due to the government's 'failure' to create a sufficient number of jobs
 isliye sabaki najar vitt mantri arun jetali par thi ki bajet main vah is bare main kya thos kadam uthaate hai
 But instead of any special action on the employment front, the finance minister has relied only on traditional efforts to correct the data and increase employment in rural areas
 is maamle main kisi khaas package kii ummid puri nahin hui
 How important this issue is, it can be understood from this that an estimated 10 in the next five years
 5 karod berozegaar naukariyon kii talash main khadey ho jaaenge
 The budget was a good opportunity for the Finance Minister to formulate and allocate concrete policies that could speed up the creation of jobs
 lekin sarkaar naukariyon ke srijan ke maamle main aankadon ko durust karne or maujuuda vikalpon ko apnaane par hi jor de rahi he
 It is believed that the rural economy and private sector will increase jobs on the basis of emerging sector

 haalanki, ipief, karmchaaree beemaa nigam, jipief or neshnal pension system kii sadsyta ke aadhaar par yah aankade tay kiye gaye hai
 Perhaps on the basis of this, the Finance Minister has said that 70 lakh jobs will be created in 2018-19

 Hundreds of commuters faced difficulties in reaching their destination in Delhi on Tuesday morning as the speed of the metro slowed down
 noida-dwarka relline par mayur vihaar stesan par ek train 30 minute se adhik samay tak fansi rahi
 During this time other trains were running very slow and intermittently
 metro seva baadhit hone se vibhinn steshnon par yatriyon kii bheed bad gai or logon ko lambe samay tak metro trainon kaa intjaar karnaa padaa
 Apart from this, passengers had to face problems due to the long delay of trains on the jahangirpuri-huda City Center rail line

 Dr
 Kalam is no more
 
 
 
 The eyes are moist since then, the tears travel over the eyelids
 
 
 
 
 laut ja rahe hai
 
 
 i have just seen on television that when the body of Bharat Ratna Dr
 Kalam reached Palam Airport in Delhi, the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Chief of Army Staff and officers were all present
 sochane lag gai ki akhir aadhunik bharat ke is rishi main aisa kya he, jisane ham sabhi ko unase bhaavnaatmak str par jod rakhaa he
 i started wondering what was it like in this person that after he left the country was mourned and even a common citizen like me has memories of him

 As i was graduating, the prestigious Engineering College ISM in Dhanbad, my home town, had a 'spring Saturnalia Festival', a three-day students' festival held annually
 is festival main aamtaur par bihar or jharkhand or bengal ke ejineering college ke chaatr bhaag lete the, lekin hamaare college kaa centre iesaim campus ke bheetar hone ke kaaran hamen bhi is festival main bhaag lene kii ijazat mil jaati thi

 i remember that i cried so much that i would be left there at night so that i would receive my award from Dr
 Kalam myself, but the householders were not prepared and my award was received by my other college colleagues instead of me
 main bahut dukhi thi, gharavaalon ko samajha paane main asamarth thi ki meraa kya chhot rahaa he lekin mere saathi meri is manodasha se vaakif the
 Dr

 Finally started thinking what is there in this sage of modern India, who has connected us all on an emotional level
 main sochane lag gai ki akhir is shaks main aisa kya tha ki unke jane ke baad desh shok main dub gaya or mere jaisi ek aam naagarik ke paas bhi unase judi yaaden hai
 In the hullabaloo of news, the 1998 month of March wandered before my eyes amidst many memories
 main grajuation kar raheen thi, mere home toun dhanbad ke pratishthit ejineering college iesaim main har saal kii tarah 'spring Saturnalia Festival' yani salanaa yojit kiye jane vaala teen din kaa students festival chal rahaa tha
 The festival was usually attended by students from engineering colleges in Bihar and Jharkhand and Bengal, but due to our college center being within the ISM campus, we were also allowed to participate in the festival
 
 
 
 
 or main apane college ke saathiyon ke saath, is festival ke kai pratiyogitaaon main shaamil hui
 By the end of three days, we had jointly won the drama, badminton and i single handedly in the Extempoor competition
 aword distribution festival ke antim din hona aadhi raat ke baad

 Dr
 Kalam landed at ism's lower ground at 4 o'clock in the afternoon from a navy green four-seater chaupar
 tab hamaare shahar kaa helleypad bhi iesaim kii ground ko chunauti nahin de paata tha
 Since this function was to be held late at night and the ISM campus was 15-20 km away from my house, i had to return home with my parents at 9 am
 mujhe yaad he ki main bahut royi thi ki mujhe raat main vahiin chhod diya jaae taaki main apana aword khud dow kalam se risive karti, lekin gharavaale taiyaar nahin hue or meraa aword mere badale mere college ke anya saathiyon ne risive kiya
 i was very sad, unable to explain to the family what i was missing, but my partner was aware of my mood
 dow kalam agle din iesaim ke bi-tech or em-tech students ke bich ek lacture dene vaale the, maine vahaan ke chaatro se madad maangi or management se parmishan lekar agle din vahaan pahunch gai
 After the lecture, when Kalam started coming out of the hall, i reached him with great difficulty, with his certificates
 
 
 
 And the certificates were extended towards them, saying, 'sir, i am Swati, winner of yesterday's Extempore and one-act Play Competition, could not come to collect her award yesterday, so today i have come to meet you
 ' On this matter, Dr
 Kalam stepped towards the door, he stopped, then turned towards me, extended his hand and said
 
 
 
 Then i thought how could a boy named Swati
 kyonki jab tumhaara naam pukaara gaya tha tab ek chaatr ye aword lene aayaa tha

 aisi khabaren aati rahati hai or ham bhi uchit rup se dhyaan nahin dete hai, lekin jab pichley dinon prime time ke chote se hisse main is baat par charchaa kii kya vajah he ki electrician kii selary ejeeniyar se zyada he to logon kii dilchaspee se hairaan ho gaya
 Thought that today we explore this issue in detail
 jisaki report thi uskaa to shrey banataa hi he to times aaf india kii namrata singh ne story file kii ki barahavin paas electrician kii maheene kii selary 11300 rupee he, jabaki degree vaale ejeeniyar kii selary 14800 yani 3500 rupee zyada he
 Both salary increases at the same speed
 pichley chah saal main electrician plumber, technician kaa vetan badha he
 While the entry level salary of IT engineers is almost the same
 ye survey timlij kaa he
 They say that when there was an IT boom ten years ago, there was a lot of demand
 tab se salanaa chaar lakh iti ejeeniyar kii maang bani hui he, yani koi khaas vruddhi nahin ai he, jabaki iti sector main hi aane vaale ejiniyaron kii taadaad badhkar 15 lakh ho gai he
 In the last few years, there have been many such reports from different institutions that most of our engineers are not eligible to give jobs
 neshnal esocysan of software and services companyj yani naiysakam ne 2011 main ek survey kiya to pataa chalaa ki 75 fisadi technical snaatak naukari ke laayak nahin hai
 The $ 60 billion IT industry spends nearly a billion dollars on training after hiring these engineers
 ek shikaayat rahati he ki degree or skill yani gyaan or hunar main faasale kii
 But how did it happen that knowledge does not mean skill or skill is separated from knowledge
 isi antar ko paatane ke liye skill deveopment ke kaarykram shuru hue or ab yah raajnneetik slogan bhi he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi repeatedly talks about skill development
 pichhali sarkaar ne 2009 main germany ke saath skill deveopment ko lekar kaarykram bhi banaae hai
 We have received from the Internet an article by Economist on Germany's Skill Development and American Radio NPR
 donon ke video se jo bhi pataa chalaa hamen laga ki aapse saajha karnaa chahie
 This picture we have taken from youtub is a picture of Hamburg Vocational and Training Institute, in which students are being taught the work of carpentry, from road construction to duct making
 kul milakar yah jaankaree haath lag pai ki germany main dual system chalata he
 More than half of the high school students there take training in any of the 344 trades
 chaahe wo chamade kaa kaam ho yaa dental technician kaa
 For this, the students also get training allowance of around $ 900 a month from the government
 skill deveopment ke course yaa to mazdoor sangh banaate hai yaa companiyaan
 The Chamber and Commerce and Industries conduct the examination there
 spain britain se lekar bharat tak sab germany ke is skill deveopment kaa modal apnaanaa chaahate hai
 The company surveying the salary of electrician and engineer says that the demand for electric fitter and plumber is very high and not available
 ek company ke data par sidhe bharosa karne se pehle iske bhav par vichaar karnaa chahie
 For this i want to mention an advertisement of JK Cement
 kai baar vigyaapan apane utpaada ke prachaar se bhi zyada kah jate hai
 In this advertisement, Professor Sahab asks what is the world's strongest material
 jawaab aata he
 
 hexagonal diamond sar
 So the other says that Sir it's nitrite
 to ek ladkaa khadaa hota he or kahata he ki maaf kiijie jeke super cement sabase majboot he
 So the children laugh
 to ladkaa jawaab detaa he ki oe ejineering karke building banaaoge yaa quij quij kheloge
 Is it not the gaps in advertising, knowledge and skills? vyaavhaarik chaturaai paatrata he to zarur gyaan main bhi kami rahi hogi
 Is it not that there is no need of engineer now? jo naukariyaan hai wo asangathit kshetra ke electrician fitre or plumber jaise kaam main hai
 Those are easy to keep and remove
 aspiring minds kii ek report ai he isi saal farvari main
 According to this, less than 20 percent engineers are eligible for jobs in the IT sector
 8 pratishat se bhi kam ejeeniyar kor ejineering ke laayak hai
 When more than 90 percent of engineers want jobs
 aspiring minds ne apni report main yah bhi likhaa he ki ek aisi arthvyavastha main padhe likhe berojgaaron kii aisi taadaad ho, yah arthvyavastha kii kushalta ke lihaaz se bhi acha nahin he or saamaajik sthirataa ke hisaab se bhi
 The reason given by the company is that the quality of writing is not very good
 apane vishay kaa buniyadi gyaan nahin he
 The college course is there, but the level of teaching or the art of teaching is bad for most colleges
 6 sitambar ke iconomik times main kendriya mantri venkaiya naidu kaa ek bayaan chapa he jo unhone vellore institut of technalji ke dikshant samaaroh main diya tha
 According to the newspaper report, the Urban Development Minister, while referring to nasscom's report, said that only 15 percent of the engineers are eligible for the job
 vakt aa gaya he ki ham yah sochen ki kya hamaare paas quality ejeeniyar hai
 34 percent of the Chinese students study engineering while only 6 percent of the total students in India
 kya venkaiya yah kah rahe hai ki or adhik ejeeniyar kii zarurat he yaa wo kah rahe hai ki jitne nikal rahe hai unki quality acchhee honi chahie yaa wo donon baaten kah rahe hai
 This is also a question
 doosraa agar electrician, plumber or technician kii maang bad rahi he to uskaa laabh kaise uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Do we have any such plans, are there any centers that can train for such jobs for less money
 zyaadaatar log to apane anubhav se sikh kar hi naukari pate hai wo bhi asthaayee
 There are many types of angles that will be talked about in prime time
 chunaavon main majahab ke aadhaar par voton kii bisaat bichaane se kuch raajnneetik dal baj nahin aate
 The Supreme Court had also given an important decision last week that 'seeking votes on the basis of religion, race, caste, community or language is a corrupt method under the election law provision
 majahab ke aadhaar par vot maangane waalon ke khilaaf ab bagpat ke ulimaon ne bhi ahm kadam uthaaya he
 The city imam of baghpat-barout has announced that those who claim to have Muslims in their favor by taking photographs in the mosque, will not be allowed to come to the mosque, if they are coming to the mosque, then only come for worship
 shahar imam aarif ul haq ke mutabik bagpat kii 550 masjidon or 143 madrason memraajnneetik dalonki ore se imadad ke naam par die jane vaale chande par bhi roak laga di gai he
 The city imam made these announcements after the meeting of the Ulama in the burnt mosque of Baghpat
 ulimaon kaa kahana tha ki nafrat failaane vaale kisi keemat par manjuur nahin kiye jane chahie
 The Ulama also said that while voting for the people, the party should not look at the candidate, it should look at its old history
 joummidavaarasbhi ko saath lekar chalata ho, vot use hi diya janaa chahie phir wo chaahe kisi bhi dal kaa kyon naa ho? bataa den ki upi vidhansabha chunaav ke pehle charan ke liye namakan mangalvaar se shuru ho rahe hai
 The first phase of polling in Baghpat is scheduled on February 11

 The country's Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said on Thursday that there were some major shortcomings in defense procurement, which could have a negative impact on the country's defense preparedness
 sansad main pesh vaayu sena or nausena par sieji kii report main kai khaamiyon kii ore ishaara kiya gaya

 This meeting was very good
 sabase badi baat he ki unhone (modi ne) kaha ki aap aadat nahin balki unke sochane kii prakriya ko badal rahi hai
 Telling them what is right and what is wrong? ”asked about Modi's support for this campaign, Kajol said,“ Officially or not
 main yah nahin kah saktiki hamane iske liye haath milaayaa he
 But, i feel that the way he talked about it, it is definitely connecting with his own Clean India campaign
 ' In the summer season, people often sleep outside the house or on the roofs when there is no electricity
 karnataka main ek aisa maamla saamne aayaa he jise dekhne ke baad baahar sone waalon ko neend nahin aegi
 Actually it happened that a woman was sleeping outside in Hebbal, Bangalore
 isi dauraan ek makadi uske kaan main ghus gai
 The woman's name is Lakshmi (49)
 lekin neend main hone kii vajah se vah jaan nahin paati hai
 After this, the pain started in his head
 pehle to laga ki sar dard kisi or vajah se ho rahaa hoga
 But gradually the pain started increasing and he was taken to the hospital
 lakshmi ne doctoron ko bataaya ki dard dhire-dhire shuru hota he or phir tej se siharan se uthati he
 The pain increased as soon as the doctor saw a flashlight in his ear
 doctor torch lagaakar jaanch kar hi rahe the tabhi uski roshni ke sahare vah makadi baahar aane kii koshish karne lagi
 The doctors made it a video of it from mobile
 makadi ke baahar aane ke baad lakshmi ko dard se raahat mil gai
 At first i felt that the head ache must have been caused by some other reason
 lekin dhire-dhire dard or badhane laga to unako aspataal le jaaya gaya
 Lakshmi told the doctors that the pain starts slowly and then wakes up with a sharp shiver
 doctor ne jaisi hi kaan main torch lagaakar dekha to dard or bad gaya
 The doctors were examining him with a flashlight, then the spider started trying to come out with the help of his light
 doctoron ne isko mobile se uskaa video bana liya
 After the spider came out, Lakshmi got relief from the pain
 sapanom kii nagari mumbai yun to donon haathon se lutaati he
 But in the matter of independence, Mumbai's hand is tight these days

 What did you see? After all, what kind of freedom are we talking about? There is at least one freedom of which we know that it is going to slip out of our hands soon - freedom of expression
 is maamle main ek baar ghutane tech die to phir bachataa hi kya he? main ise nijee maamla banane ke paksh main nahin hum, lekin pichley hafte mere twit par jo ghinauna vivaad paidaa hua vah saarvajanik vimarsh kaa ek behad ghatiya or sadakchhaap sanskaran he
 Despite the cheap responses to this incident, i am not ready to publicly show my faith and reverence to Mumbai and Maharashtra to please anyone
 main is baat ko lekar pareshaan hum ki siyaasi takatein khulkar baahubal kaa prayog kar rahi he
 i am really worried about something completely different: we are seeing that political forces are openly using muscle power with complete nudity
 iske alaava kuch chune hue giroh apane chuninda vot bainkon ko rijhaate hue jis tarah chunavi raajnneeti kar rahe hai, usamen ve aise kisi bhi vyakti ke prati barbar ho sakate hai jiske vichaar unke hiton se mail na khate hon
 These political thugs have made a deal of independence
 sara maamla unki aazaadee banaam baaki sabaki aazaadee kaa ban gaya he
 Now, while the much-hyped word 'ELITE' has been given official recognition as a slang for people like us, and it is hurled at us whenever we want, what do we do? Shall we sit down in our corners and be afraid? There are countless leaders in this country who have cheated the public and become millionaires overnight
 unke barakes karodon mehanatakash log hai, aise eemaandaar naagarik jo vastav main padhate-likhte hai or apni pasand kaa pesha chunate hai or apni mehnat kii kamai khate hai
 They pay taxes honestly and enjoy life to the fullest
 ho saktaa he ki is sukh ko bhi kisi din aparaadh ghoshit kar diya jaae
 However, many people who accuse me are far more money than me
 ve aaleeshaan gharon main rahete hai, badi kaaren chalaate hai or unhone itani daulat batori he jiskaa koi hisaab nahin he
 Some have serious criminal charges against them
 ye hi ve log hai jo janata kaa munh band kar dena chaahate hai
 These are the same people who speak abusive things about the people on page 3
 aakhir inke asantosh kii vajah kya he? kya sirf paisa?aisa nahin he
 There is nothing worse than no money at all
 yah maamla dimagi he
 Well, anyone can make money, but from which market will you buy the idea? The resentment is actually about thinking another way
 unki asli kuntha yah he ki apni jindagi main unhone chaahe kitna hi paisa kyon na bana liya ho, lekin ek cheez jise lekar ye hameshaa tarasate rahete hai lekin jo inase dur bhaagti he vah he pratishtha
 Now they will not be able to earn respect, so it is better to keep losing respect
 mukt vichaar kaa daman darasal isi kuntha kaa nateeja he
 Anyone who has a different view from them, a clear message is conveyed to them that they should either speak to us or else! Either think according to us or else! After all, what are they afraid of? Whenever i read such pretentious things which mention the martyrdom of 105 people at the time of the formation of Maharashtra in 1956, i want to ask which one political party has till date improved the life of a common Marathi Have you done anything? If the leaders had been truly sincere and sincere, remembering their memories, they would have ensured that Maharashtra was prosperous on every front
 unhone mumbai ko ek vishwastareey mahanagar banane par dhyaan lagaaya hota, jabaki hua iskaa thik ulataa he
 Maharashtra is shattered
 mumbai ko duniya ke sabase gande shaharon main gina jaataa he
 Corruption pervades everyday life
 or ab yah surat he—ashishnutaa or dhamkee, ranjish or hinsa
 a disgusting battle is being fought to establish a united rule over Mumbai
 chaahe kitna hi ganda kyon na ho, kitna hi badboodaar, lekin mumbai aaj bhi bharat kaa awwal shahar he
 Once Mumbai is in your possession, what else to say
 yahaan bahut kuch daanv par laga rahata he
 This is the reason why even a simple and simple tweet gives rise to such filthy responses when he did not hand over a weak vein but a weakness
 koi nahin chahta ki mumbai naam kii sone ke andey dene vaali murgi uske haath se phisal jaae
 After all, what is a city without its residents? Mumbai is due to its extraordinary people
 mumbai har mumbaikar kii apni he
 And if there is one thing Mumbaikar hates, it is bullying and silencing

 The evidence presented by the government lawyer in the court was not matching with the claims of the police and according to Google's report, Jai was not present at the time of the incident
 beete guuruuvaar ko court ne jai ko nirdosh maanate hue bari kar diya
 The court said that the role of the police in this case is questionable

 When the name of 95-year-old Shastri ji was announced for this award on 25 January, he called it an insult to be given to him at this age and he and his wife Chhaya Devi were very angry about it and did not accept the Padma Shri award
 Wanted baad main apane prashansakon evam shubhachintakon ke samajhane ke baad ve iske liye raji ho gaye the
 Family sources said that an angry Shastri again refused to accept the Padma Shri award on Sunday evening after the central government demanded bio-data for the award
 sutron ne bataaya ki shastri ne kaha he ki unke jaise kavi ko is puraskaar ko paane ke liye apana biodata dene kii kya jarurat he
 On 26 January, Acharya Janaki Ballabh Shastri said that he was always ignored and many people from his later generations have been honored with this award in the past
 aise main is umr ne ise unhen die jane kaa koi matlab nahin he
 Shastriji had said that he was not enthusiastic about receiving this award and that he would accept the amount received from it for the service of his domesticated cattle

 The specialty of Chinese products is that they are available at a much lower price than Indian products
 iske alaava chinis product main vairieti kai hoti hai or dekhne main aakarshak hote hai
 Devraj Baweja, general secretary of the Sadar Bazaar Market Association, says that it is not that some people have not boycotted the Chinese product
 kai graahak aise aate hai jo kehete hai ki hamen indian product hi lenaa he, lekin majaburi he
 More variety and lower prices are available only in Chinese products, Indian products are not so attractive

 In many markets of Delhi, Chinese products are being sold inside coaches written in Made in India

 There are many items in India that are not yet manufactured
 aise main china se emport karnaa majaburi ho jaataa he
 Overall, one thing is clear that even though we may boycott Chinese products on social media, the reality is that Chinese products are dominant in all major markets of Delhi

 While photographing Jared, the photographer was also not bothered, as the photographer was none other than Kelsey's sister Kayna Smort
 jered kerena ke saath francfort kentki ke paas elkhorn creek naamak jharne par pahunche or photoshute karaayaa
 However, Jared had not told his wife anything about this plan
 isliye jab jered ne kelsi ko photoshute kii tasviren dikhaai to vah khushi se rone lagi
 After the photoshoot, Jared said, 'when she saw the pictures, she started crying
 uske honton par hansi thi
 'jared continued,' i just wanted to make him laugh a little bit
 main jaanata tha ki vah shoot kii tarif karegi, kyonki use ek acchhee hansi kii zarurat thi
 'jared told his wife Kelsey that she was ill and in the hospital for the past week
 vah bahut photogenic he or tasviren lenaa pasand karti he
 Regarding his maternity photo, Jared said, "I never even dreamed that they would go viral
" 'unhone kaha, 'isane hamen puri tarah se hairaan kar diya
 i was doing all this only to try to please my wife, but now it is nice to see the positive responses
 ' kelsi ne pichley saptaah ek swasth bachche ko janm diya tha
 So now Jared's priority is to look after the health of both the mother and child before going to Kelsey's house

 The court sought treatment in this regard, after which Mahesh was sent to Mayaganj Hospital for treatment on Friday and Saturday

 His health suddenly deteriorated on Sunday evening

 parijanon kaa aarope he ki mahesh kaa ilaaj sahi dhang se nahin kiya gaya jiske chalate unki maut hui
 He also says that Mahesh could have opened alive many more secrets related to the scam

 In this incident, their 2 daughters including husband and wife were injured
 iske baad bhi driver car par kaabo nahin kar paaya or usne footpath se guzar rahe 2 or yuvako ko takkar maar di, jiske chalate wo bhi gabhir rup se jakhmi ho gaye

 police uski talash kar rahi he
 Pakistan is a country supporting terrorism, it is in its DNA
 bharat or pakistan ke bich aatankwaad hi sabase badi or mul samasya he
 He continues to support terrorism even today
 yah baat antarrashtriya ranneetik maamalon ke visheshgy farid jakaaria ne india today group ke editor-in-chif arun puri or TVTN ke managing editor rahul kanwal ke saath vishesh baatcheet ke dauraan kahi
 He said that it is very difficult for Pakistan to break the alliance with terrorism
 isaki vajah se bharat or pakistan ke bich rishte saamaanya karnaa behad mushkil he
 However, he said that PM Modi is a powerful leader
 unako usee tarah pakistan ke saath aage badhanaa chahie, jaise america ke raashtrapati rahe richard nicksan apane samay main samyavaadee china ke saath aage bade the
 Similarly, the then US President Ronald Reagan stepped forward with the Soviet Union under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachov
 bharat ke liye gathbandhan jarurijakaria ne kaha ki bharat ko dirghakaalin ranneeti samajhane or ubhartee bhugolic raajnneetik (geo-political) vyavastha main badi bhoomika nibhaane ke liye ek gathbandhan banane kii jarurat he
 India has to understand what it wants to do? He should decide it first
 bharat kabhi global leader bananaa chahta he, to kabhi vikaas par focus karnaa chahta he
 Zakaria's statement comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, in which he strongly supported globalization
 daavos main world iconomic forum se itar india today se exclusive intervyuu main jakaaria ne kaha ki ab aisa lagata he ki ham aise samay main hai, jahaan raajnneeti or arthvyavastha ek-duusare se kaaphi alag he
 Foreign affairs expert Zakaria said that we are living in an era of economically synchronous global development
 aaj duniya kaa har bada kshetra aage bad rahaa he, jabaki dashakon pehle aisa nahin tha
 On the question of India's global situation slower than China, Zakaria said that there are fundamental facts behind the emergence of China in the new global order
 china ne apane game ko samajha or uske anusaar aage kii ranneeti banaai
 India now needs to identify an international agenda to counter its powerful neighbor China
 aaj china ke mukaable bharat dhimi gati se aage bad rahaa he, jabaki bharat kii kshamta zyada he
 Therefore, India needs to recognize its potential
 jakaaria kaa kahana he ki kya bharat apni ranneeti or lakshya ko jane bina antarrashtriya str par badi bhoomika chahta he? CNN kii mejabani karne vaale farid jakaaria ne kaha ki yah teji se bahaav kaa yug he
 There is more discomfort here
 unhone kaha ki mujhe samaj main nahin aa rahaa he ki aakhir bharat apana game kyon nahin jaananaa chaah rahaa he
 He also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's diplomatic initiative with world leaders during a conversation with India Today Group editor-in-chief Arun Puri in PM Modi's speech in Davos
 haalanki unhone yah bhi kaha ki piem modi daavos main apane bhaashan ke jariye bharat ke ranneetik sandesh ko antarrashtriya samudaay tak puri tarah nahin pahunchaa paae
 There was a lack of strategic message in his speech, which clearly means that you do not have a single strategy
 jakaaria ne kaha ki bharat ko asia main apni ranneetik banane kii jarurat he
 India is moving slower than China, while its capacity is more
 lihaaja bharat ko apni kshamta ko pahchaanane or jamini str par badlaav karne kii jarurat he
 He said that China is constantly focusing on its development and economy
 saath hi apni videsh niti par puri tarah khamosh he
 At the same time, the attitude of Russia is completely different
 vah apni kshamta se aage badhkar antarrashtriya nitiyon main dakhal detaa he
 He questioned whether Modi's inauguration speech at the World Economic Forum could increase foreign investment? Zakaria said that PM Modi is very open about business and has introduced reforms, but foreign investors will have to deal with bureaucracy and license rajas, government banks and courts
 unhone kaha ki sirf daavos main red corpet bichaane se kuch nahin hoga, balki jameen par chizon ko badalanaa hoga
 Modi has the ability to do better with Pakistan
 
 
 jakaaria ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki pradhanmantri modi main pakistan ke saath kuch behatar karne kii kshamta he, jise unhone ab tak nahin kiya he
 He has the ability to do what Nixon did on the China tour
 'unhone kaha ki agar aapako yaad ho, nicksan communist desh china ja sakate the or sauda kar sakate the kyonki wo ek kattar samyavaadee virdohi the
 He was a radical right-wing politician who had always been so anti-communist that no one would question his credibility
 jakaaria ne kaha ki agar modi pakistan ke saath kuch acha karne kaa prayaas karen to unki narmi ke liye koi bhi un par atake karne vaala nahin he
 And this will indeed be a chance to change the mutual relationship and transform the subcontinent
 bharat-paak karen vyapaar to hogi badi jeetunhone jor dekar kaha ki agar bharat or pakistan ek saath vyapaar karte hai, to yah ek badi jeet hogi
 He said that in some analysis i have found that this step can increase the GDP of India
 lekin kya gorilla rupi pakistani sena kii maujuudagi main bharat pakistan ke saath samjhauta kar saktaa he? kya pakistani sena ko baatcheet main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he yaa kya yah rajanyik rup se sambhav he?jakaaria ne kaha ki yah kiya ja saktaa he
 The Pakistani army is so powerful that there will be no problem in negotiations
 lekin unhone wo kaaran bhi bataaya ki kyon pakistani sena aisa nahin karnaa chaahati
 She (pak Army) plays this game cleverly so that she can get rid of all the responsibilities and control from behind the scenes
 musharraf ke kaarykaal ke dauraan hamaare paas ek sunaharaa mauka tha
 Perhaps, some things could have changed, now that chance is gone
 'desh ke saare dhandhe phaayde main, sirf kisaan kaa dhandha ghate main he' ye kahana he sapa mukhiya mulaayam singh yadav kaa
 At the All India Kisan Mahasammelan organized at the Indira Gandhi Foundation in Lucknow today, the SP chief made every effort to prove SP as a party of farmers in front of the peasant leaders from different parts of the country along with Uttar Pradesh
 sapa mukhiya kaa kahana tha ki jab tak desh kaa kisaan sukhi nahin hoga, tab tak desh sampann or mahaan nahin ban saktaa
 Sugarcane farmers of the state, who came to the Samajwadi Party's Kisan Sammelan, were also angry with the Samajwadi Party government
 unki naaraazgi is baat par thi ki jahaan pradesh kii sapa sarkaar unke bakaae ganne kaa bhugtan nahin kar rahi he vahiin sapa mukhiya kisaanon ke hit ke liye bade bade vaade or daawey kar rahe hai
 Looking at the Lok Sabha elections closely, Mulayam Singh Yadav's eyes are now fixed on the farmers of the country
 akhil bhartiya kisaan mahasammelan kaa main bataur mukhya atithi sapa mukhiya ne sapa ko kisaanon kaa rahanuma sabit karne kii purajor koshish kii
 He said that farmers are always given priority in Samajwadi Party policy
 desh main sabase zyada berogari kii samasya kaa samaadhaan sabase zyada kisaanon ne kiya he, kyonki desh ke 72 pratishat logon ke paas kheti he, jinamein 65 pratishat kisaan khud kheti karte hai
 SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav said that the power problem in UP has been overcome to a great extent by the Akhilesh government and he has also promised that the power problem in UP will be resolved within the next year and a half

 The entire Rs 96,000 crore
 kaa profit kar diya
 But the national leader you are talking about less
 jis vibhaag main ham hai, uski charchaa karte hai
 What do you want to be called? You are the largest party in the UPA after Congress
 pakistan main jo kuch hua, pakistan ne jo kuch pratikriya di
 You are popular among Muslims, also among Hindus
 pakistan main aap lokapriy hai hi
 So don't you think that you should have spoken out loud about Pakistan? When a minister is speaking, everyone has his consent
 jab har mantri alag-alag sur-taal main bole to vah bhi acchhee baat nahin he
 Where an issue goes the wrong way, i speak
 par lalu ji kii abhi pakistan ko koi salaah he yaa nahin?pakistan ko meri salaah he ki bharat apane padosiyon se, khaas taur par pakistan ke saath milakar shantipurvak dhang se rahanaa chahta he
 The common people of Pakistan are also affected by terrorism
 bharat or duniya bhar main aatankwaad ko lekar chintaa badi he
 The terrorist incident in Mumbai, with the evidence that we had allegations, it was not appropriate to condone that, yet they have admitted it is a good thing
 der aae, durust aae
 Are you satisfied, what has Pakistan done so far? Satisfied does not mean that you accept and we are satisfied
 aap karrwai karen
 Don't you think they are deliberately demanding that our criminals return so that India stops demanding the criminals they were already demanding? India will not lag behind in decriminalizing terrorism
 yuddh kisi bhi samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin he, kisi bhi desh ke liye
 a war between two countries proves to be tragic for all
 mumbai par jo hamalaa hua, samudr ke raste se jo hamaare upar hamalaa hua, usamen to hamaari khamiyaan thim
 You said in the UPA that national parties are becoming irrelevant
 bilkul
 See which were the national parties, the Congress party, later the BJP
 
 
 hamaari bhi party ek rashtriya party abhi ho gai he
 i am saying very objectively that the existence of national parties has decreased
 alag-alag rajyon main logon kii alag samaj he, partiyon ke alag-alag aadhaar hai chunaav jeetne ke
 National parties want that these small parties cease to exist
 rashtriya party kii ichha se sab kuch nahin chalata
 The democracy that the people of the country gives, will have to be followed in democracy
 aapako lagata he niyat kharaab he inaki?niyat nahin
 They have got a challenge in the era of coalition
 meri jo apni finding he
 
 
 
 mujhe dur-dur tak nahin lagata ki koi bhi rashtriya party bahumat paaegi
 Now the Congress said that at the national level, we will not tie up with any UPA party? This discussion came, but it was not true
 koi bhi party, chaahe vah congress ho, bhaajapa ho, sipiem ho, agar vah kisi se nahin judana chaahati to koi jor jabardastee to he nahin
 
 
 If a party wants everyone to live under our banner, how can anyone stay in the banner
 gathbandhan to he
 The alliance is to sidestep communal forces
 desh bachaane ke liye sarkaar kii jarurat to he
 We could not leave the country in such hands, who demolish the Babri Masjid, riot, do not believe in Muslim brothers
 phir vahi raag rata ja rahaa he ki mandir banaaenge
 Who is Mai Ka Red who will stop us? Shall we sit We will not allow them to enter the corridors of power by making all kinds of sacrifices
 aapkaa sirf sarkaar banane kaa gathbandhan he, rajnatik gathbandhan kyon nahin banataa?hamaara gathbandhan he
 The alliance will remain, as long as there is terrorism, riot-fighting
 aatankwaad, sampradayikta ye sabhi judawaan bahanen hai
 People are divided in your UPA
 pavaar sahab bhi to shivasena se baat kar rahe hai
 Whoever catches communalism will be destroyed
 chaahe vah lalu ho yaa koi or
 Whether or not a non-congress PM can be there after the election? How can it not? Anyone can be
 to usamen aap bhi shaamil hai?nahin, ham nahin shaamil hai
 But we have to become one day

 ji haa, lashkar kaa sargana or das milian dollar inami aatankwaadi hafiz said kaa dar pehali baar jamaane ke saamne aayaa he
 Till yesterday, Hafiz Saeed used to teach India a lesson
 aaj vahi hafiz said bhartiya fouj se buree tarah dar gaya he or uskaa ye dar baqayada ek video main kaid ho gaya
 Terrorist Hafiz Saeed is saying "I present my Tehsim today on this great Azim sacrifice of my Azim Kashmiri brothers
 indian army chif se ye kahana chahta hum ki kabase goliyaan maar rahe hai
 Shot straight
 
 Is this the way to kill men and women? ye darjan se zyada katl or bisiyon jakhmi jaan tod rahe hai
 Killing these pills does not solve the issues in the world
 vajeer-e-ajam se guzarish karata hum is masale ko chhod naa diya jaae
 "what happened to Hafiz? maaloom hota he aatankistan main sab kheriyat nahin he
 Otherwise, Hafiz Saeed, famous for his giddy gestures, does not appear in the statements of helplessness
 ghati main oparation ol out kaa asar hafiz said or uske gurgon par thik vaise hi ho rahaa he
 Like mosquitoes after installing mosquito repellent in the house
 bharat kaa dushman hafiz said kah rahaa he "main poochta hum army chif ke saath jo aakhri oparation karne ja rahaa he
 Shot straight
 mardon auraton ko is tarah katl karnaa kya yahi rastaa he taharikon ko khatm karne kaa
 To solve this problem
 asia ke sabase bade champion banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 i want to ask that Indian Government and the Army Chief
 jo ijapha kiya he to aap iskaa kya nateeja le leng
 There is only one path
 kashmir ko aazaadee do
 "actually, they were taking our soldiers lightly
 magar sena ne thodi aankh kya dikhaai
 He came on his knees only
 or insaaniyat kaa paath padhaane lage
 But sir, the first condition for taking or giving lessons of humanity
 insaan hona he
 And in this scale, this most dreaded terrorist of the world does not fit
 khayr ise hafiz said kii wo baukhalaahat samajhie jise alphaz nahin mil paa rahe hai
 Due to the Operation Allout of the Indian Army, the condition of the terrorists who exported from Pakistan to Kashmir has been in the form of Tu Chal Main Main Aaya
 ab alam ye he ki kashmir ke tamaam aatanki sanghathanon main staff kii kami ho gai he
 And to meet this deficiency, the youth of Kashmir are being kidnapped so that they can be tricked into making them terrorists
 jo apni hi ghati ke logon kaa katleam karen
 But Operation All Out has taken away all the plans of Hafiz
 or ulta ghati ko begunaahon ke khun se laal karne vaala ab shanti kaa paath padhaa rahe hai
 The army's operation has not only washed away all the wishes of Hafiz, but has also made him realize that this full action of the Indian soldiers will continue till the terrorists of the valley are taken to heaven
 saal abhi khatm bhi nahin hua or sena ab tak 251 aatankiyon ko maut ke ghat utaar chuki he
 The count will still continue
 or tab tak ye countdown chalata rahegaa, jab tak ghati ko aatankiyon se clin nahin kar diya jaataa
 The army has also vowed that unless Pakistan stops feeding the stones of treason to the treason
 tab tak ye oparation rukne vaala nahin he
 So till then get used to these videos of Hafiz mourning
 apane video massej main hafiz said kah rahaa he "main aaj apane azim kashmiri bhaaiyon kii is kadra azim qurbaani par aaj unako tahseem pesh karata hum or main yakeen se kahata hum ki inshollah kashmir kii aazaadee ke din kareeb hai
 Allah ta'ala sacrifices the sacrifice
 jald sehatyab kare lekin main guzarish karnaa chahta hum ki aapane bade raste kaa intakhaab kar liya he
 The surface that has been sacrificed
 aazaadee kii kuch nahin he
 Insha Allah very soon, the people of Kashmir will have a magnificent independence, the biggest incident of this century
 "hafiz said kaa gam samajha ja saktaa he
 Because for the last two years
 
 Ever since Operation All Out has started
 tab se sarhad paar se bharat main aatanki aate to zarur hai, magar waapas nahin ja pate hai
 Till now hundreds of Hafiz's henchmen have sacrificed without doing anything
 or aatank ke ek bhi mansoobey ko bhartiya sena ne puraa nahin hone diya he

 The manner in which Pakistan is trying to target BSF personnel through sniping on the International Border and Line of Control
 usase biguef ko hameshaa do chaar hona padataa he
 The BSF has decided to train and practice some of its commandos with Israeli sniper commandos to better respond to this snipping
 biguef sutron kii maane to iskaa ek prapojal grih mantralay ko bhi bheja gaya he
 After receiving the written approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs, a small team of BSF will first go to Israel where it will participate in the sniping competition and sniping seminar between 6 to 11 July
 sutron ke mutabik sab kuch behatar rahaa to aane vaale samay main BSF commando kii duusari team ko isroyal bhejkar isroyal ke nishanebaajon se khaas tareeke kii training dilavaayegi
 More than 145 Pakistani snipers deployed on the loc have such intelligence that Pakistan keeps trying to target BSF personnel on the International Border and Line of Control through sniping
 iske liye khaastaur par usne apane alag-alag diopi par trend snipers ko tainaat kiya he
 According to intelligence sources, the Pakistan Army and ISI have deployed more than 145 snipers along the Line of Control and the International Border
 pakistan in sharp shooters ke jariye samay-samay par bhartiya suraksha balon ko nishaanaa banane kii koshish karata rahata he
 According to intelligence sources, the Pakistan Army in Pakistan occupied Kashmir across the loc has Machhal, Uri, Tangdhar, Poochh, Bimber Gali, Rampur, Krishna Valley ( Krishna Ghati) and his dreaded snipers in front of Mendhar
 aatanki snipers ko shooting ke badale paak detaa he 1 lakh rupaesutron ke mutabik in snipers ko pioke main maujuud training camp main paak kii 'special oparation team' ke saath trend kiya gaya he
 According to the information, Pakistan's regular army remains as snipers
 iske saath hi aatanki sanghathan lashkar, jaish or hijbul ke aatankiyon ko bhi snipers ke taur par bhartee kiya gaya he
 Intelligence sources have informed that these snipers were deployed at several places along with the Mujahid Battalion of Pakistan
 sutron ke anusaar pakistan kii army in aatanki snipers ko shooting ke badale main 50 hajaar se 1 lakh tak kii rakam bhi detaa he
 Why does Pakistan sniping Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI and Pakistan Rangers are always in a position to send terrorists from the International Border as well as the Line of Control
 isi ke chalate pakistan international border or line of control par jahaan sijafire ulanghan karata he, to vahiin duusari taraf bhartiya suraksha balon kii kadi nigaraanee or mustaidi ke chalate aatankiyon kii ghuspaith karaane main naakaam pakistan baukhalaakar apane snipers ke jariye bhartiya suraksha balon ko nishaanaa banaata rahata he
 Indian security personnel are stationed on mounts located at different places in the international border, from where they carry out full surveillance of the border through hand held thermal images
 saath hi is chaukasee kii vajah se pakistan aatankiyon kii ghuspaith nahin kara paata
 In such a situation, Pakistan targets BSF and Army personnel present on the border through sniping
 lekin ab BSF ke jawan khaas tareeke kii training israel ke un sniper commando se lenge jinka nishaanaa arjuna kii tarah sateek he
 After this training of BSF with Israel, Pakistan's sniper will not have the courage to look at bsf's sniper

 Open defecation is a major obstacle in the path of cleanliness campaign
 isi par logon ko jaagruk karne ke liye sharaab kii botalon par stikers kaa sahaara liya ja rahaa he
 These stickers read - 'animals cannot use the toilet
 
 
 lekin aap to kar sakate hai na
 
 
 Have you got your toilet built? ”on the orders of the Excise Department, on all contracts of domestic and foreign liquor, these stickers are being sold on bottles
 in thekon ke celsman kaa kahana he ki quarter, hof, phul sabhi tarah kii botalon par ye steekar lagaae ja rahe hai
 Some customers who buy liquor are calling this step good, while some are considering it wrong
 ek graahak ne kaha ki swatchta se judaa ye sandesh to bahut acha he lekin sharaab kii bottle par tasviir ke saath ise likhaa dekhakar aisa lagata he ki ham sharaab bhi saath hi chhod den
 One customer said that putting such a sticker on a bottle of wine is utterly wrong
 dena bhi tha to aisi tasviir dene kii kya jarurat thi jisamen kute ke saath insaan ko baithe hue dikhaaya gaya he
 In fact, the excise department is giving a message of 'not defecating in the open' through stickers under the campaign named 'rupalu Alirajpur' (sundar Alirajpur)
 alirajpur menabakaari vibhagake sahaayak ayukta nageshwari son kesari kaa kahana he ki alirajpur jilaadivasibahulya or bahut pichhadaa jila he, isliye yahaan janajagriti kii aavashyaktaa duusare jilon se zyada he
 Collector of Alirajpur Ganesh Shankar Mishra said that this unique experiment has been done in collaboration with the Excise Department
 uddeshy sirf itnaa he ki logon ko kisi bhi tarah se jaagruk kiya jaae or alirajpur kokhule main shauchaki samasya se mukt karaayaa jaae

 The death of Australian batsman Phil Hughes was a shock to the cricket world
 vishwa bhar menhuge kii mautne logon ko shok se bhar diya
 But three days after Hughes was injured by a bouncer, former Israeli cricketer and umpire Hillel Oscar also died of a ball in the jaw
 isroyal ke ashdod shahar main ek match ke dauraan ballebaaj ne shot lagaaya, to gend saamne ke chor par ampiring kar rahe auskar ke jabade main ja lagi
 The injury was so severe that Oscar fell there
 unhen turant aspataal le jaaya gaya, jahaan ilaaj ke dauraan unki maut ho gai
 The 55-year-old Oscar was a former captain of the Israeli cricket team and currently umpiring
 hilel kii maut khabar, to bani lekin unki maut se vishwa patal par shok kii koi lahar paidaa nahin hui
 As much as lamenting the death of Hughill Hugh in India, perhaps not Hillel's death
 jabaki hilel kaa taalluk bharat se tha
 Hillel was of Indian origin and belonged to Maharashtra
 hilel kii maut ne pehali baar isroyal ke cricket kii halchal ko bhartiya media main praasangik banaaya
 Before this, hardly anyone knows that Israel also plays cricket
 israeli cricket kaa bhartiya conection aitihaasik he
 Historian Ramachandra Guha has also mentioned this in his book on the history of Indian cricket

 ye naam isroyal or bhartiya rang ko apane main samete hue hai
 The surnames of the players suggest that their ancestors came to Israel from the west coast of India
 jo hairatangej tareeke se bharat ke mahaan khilaadi sachin tendulkar kaa ghar bhi he
 Guha writes, 'even after being mingled with the Jewish fraternity of the Middle Ages, they have probably retained their native villages and occupations as surnames, just like their Indian fraternities
 kehimkar vastav main kehim ke honge or raajpurkar, raajpur se rahe honge or isi tarah baaki sab bhi honge
 Many of these migrated to Israel in the 1960s–70s
 'bharat ke log jahaan bhi jate hai apane saath apni pahchaan ko banaae rakhte hai
 Overseas Indian Jews are advancing cricket in the country
 hilel auskar unheen me se ek the
 The customs and traditions are transferred from one generation to the next
 ye vaaskar or nagaonkar jo isroyal main cricket ke nayakon main se ek hai

 isroyal kii pavitra bhoomi main bhi bharat ke vanshaj apane haathon main gend or balla thame hue maujuuda cricket peedi ke taaranhar ban rahe hai
 On hearing this, it seems that this piece of Israeli land which may also be a must-have for world cricket tomorrow, is moving within itself, incorporating the old Indian soul

 " NCP President Sharad Pawar has thrown a new dice for the Mission 2014 i
e
 Lok Sabha elections
 pavaar ne ek ore ishrat jahaan ko bekasoor tehraaya to vahiin ye tak kah daalaa ki agar aise peedit parivaar kaa koi sadsy kuch gaiyrkanoonee harakat karata he, to isamen galat kya he
 Many of the things Pawar mentioned in his speech were shocking
 unhone kaha, 'agar begunaah muslimon ko kisi bhi aatanki gatividhiyon se jodakar giraftaar kiya jaataa he, to uskaa puraa parivaar tabah hota he
 In such a situation, if a member of the family acts illegally in anger, then there will be nothing wrong in that
 ' unhone ye bhi saaf kar diya ki kisi begunaah muslim par anyaay hota he to ensipi unke peeche khadi rahegi
 According to Pawar's new 'chal' Pawar to woo Muslim voters, 'RR Patil was that meeting, i told him in public meeting, in front of everyone that my conscience does not allow it, i cannot believe this at all It may be that the youth of Muslim society can bomb in mosque on the day of jumme, the youth of Muslim society can do anything else, but it cannot
 mujhe isapar vishwaas nahin, aapaki tafteesh galat disha main ja rahi he
 You have to change this, these casteism and communal forces are a conspiracy to discredit this society

 kya he ye! college main padhane vaali ek nirdosh ladki aatankavadi ho gai
 Now the authorities investigating that case have to go to jail
 court ne is maamle ko monitor kiya tabhi asaliyat baahar aane lagi, lekin uskaa parivaar barbaad ho gaya hoga
 The only earning girl of that family was fryed with bullets
 wo sara parivaar tabah ho gaya
 And if such kind of injustice happens on the boys and girls of a family, then if their anger remains in the mind of another child of that family, then we cannot hold that child responsible
 jab tak najariya nahin badalegaa aisi ghatnaayen hoti rahengi
 The NCP stands with them in the joys and sorrows of the small sections of the society and the families who are being oppressed and tortured, to give them justice
 ye sandesh hamen samaaj main pahunchane kaa kaam karnaa he
 On the reservation issue, Sharad Pawar said, 'people of economically backward Maratha, Brahmin or Muslim society should get reservation
 'pichley loksabhaa chunaav ke samay maharashtra ke sabase taqatvar dalit netaa ramdaas athawale ensipi ke saath the, is baar ramdaas athawale shivasena kaa daaman tham chuke hai
 Perhaps due to this, Pawar wants to win the election by playing politics of reservation like Maratha, Brahmin and Muslim like Mayawati this time to balance the vote bank

 Thankfully he did not say that the farmer did not commit suicide

 Even if not committed suicide due to debt, it is the duty of a government to see what are the reasons for 16 farmers committing suicide within ten days

 The Chief Minister had said that loans of up to two lakhs of all small and marginal farmers will be forgiven
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhiyegaa ki kisaanon par do lakh se adhik kaa karz he
 Even after loan waiver, farmers are not getting rid of loan
 unka puraa karz maaf nahin ho rahaa he, jabaki chunavi bhaashanon main sampurna karz maafee kii baat karte the
 The Chief Minister said before the budget that ten lakh farmers will be benefited
 daawa tha ki kareeb 56 fisadi kisaanon ko isse phayda hoga
 Accordingly, a loan waiver of 21,000 crore is made, but Finance Minister Manpreet Badal has made a provision of only 1500 crore while presenting the budget
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sabhi seemaant kisaanon ko puure do lakh rupee tak kii karz maaf kar di jaaegi chaahe un par kitna bhi karz kyon na ho
 If you add it, then it accounts for close to 30,000 crores
 bajet main us tarah se nahin kaha gaya he jaise bajet se pehle mukhyamantri ne elaan kiya tha
 Not only this, no loan will be waived for farmers with more than five acres of land
 mukhyamantri ne yah bhi kaha ki khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ke jitne bhi lone baaki honge, wo sarkaar chukaayegi
 Financial assistance of up to five lakh rupees will be given to the farmers who commit suicide
 jugraj singh agar 20 june tak zindaa hote to unka das lakh kaa karz is yojana ke tahat maaf nahin hota, ab faansee laga lee he to shaayad rajya sarkaar unka lone chukaa degi
 The Punjab government has also decided to repeal section 67A of the Punjab Cooperative Societies Act 1961
 ab kisaanon kii zamin na to nilaam hogi or na zabt
 This decision can provide relief to the farmers as there will be no fear of losing the land if they do not repay the loan

 Now come towards Maharashtra
 somvaar raat maharashtra sarkaar ke mantriyon ke samooh or kisaan netaaon ke bich baatcheet hui ki karz maafee kii sharten kya hongi
 Farmer leaders say that this conversation did not yield results
 unka aarope he ki sarkaar vaade se mukar rahi he
 The state government said in its proposal that the state remained dry between 2013 and 2016, so only one lakh will be waived out of the loan taken till June 30, 2016
 jin kisaanon ke paas car he, jo inakam tex bharte hai, jinke parivaar main koi sarkari karmchaaree he, unka karz maaf nahin hoga
 At the guest house where the farmer leaders were talking, they started shouting slogans and burning copies of the government's proposal
 maharashtra or punjab ne karz maafee kaa elaan to kar diya, magar itani sharten laga di gayi hai ki is maafee kaa koi khaas matlab nahin rah jaataa he

 70 percent of the defaulters are industrialists

 You think a farmer with a debt of four lakh commits suicide, here the defaulter industrialist of fifty fifty thousand crore is meeting with bank officials
 kisaan ko bank se kitna vakt miltaa he or ek udyogpati ko isi kaa hisaab nikaala janaa chahie
 But loans are not the only problem of farmers
 sarkaron kii mausami samvedansheeltaa kaa prashasan par bhi asar padataa he varna jis kisaan ke liye mukhyamantri se lekar mantri tak upwas par baith jate hai uske shav ko postmortem ke baad ghar le jane ke liye auto main khaat daalkar nahin le janaa padataa
 You may be wondering why the ambulance was not given
 siemo ne bataaya ki mritak kisaan ke saath kai log aa gaye the ve sabhi ambulance main nahin aa sakate the isliye unhone ye auto kar liya
 The CMO said that if there was a talk about the pass, he would have made arrangements but they are far away
 vidisha main zila aspataal he or jahaan se yah shav laayaa gaya tha wo kaaphi nahin balki maatr saath kimi dur tha
 Well those who could not come in the ambulance, they came in this auto
 vaise police kii goli se mare chah kisaanon ke ghar mukhyamantri ko janaa tha tab saat helipad banaae gaye the, barish ho gai isliye ek kaa hi istamaal hua, mukhyamantri baaki jagahon par car se gaye
 35-year-old Jeevan Singh Meena was a resident of Bamaura, a village in Karia police station in Vidisha district
 maa-baap kii iklauti santan the
 He committed suicide by hanging himself on Monday morning
 jivan ne kshetreey gramin bank se sava lakh or sahakaari bank se teen lakh lone liya tha
 If he could not repay the loan, he could not get a loan for the next sowing, so that he could not buy fertilizer and seeds
 parijanon ne bataaya ki tanaav main the
 a few days ago, he gave his land to the sharecropper and hanged his wife and three daughters on Monday
 postmortem report to yahi kahati he ki jivan singh kii maut dam ghutane se hi hui yani faansee lagane se
 According to the report of National Crime Branch Bureau, in 2015, 581 farmers committed suicide in Madhya Pradesh
 jivan singh ke baad ab jugraj singh kii kahani
 Jugraj Singh was a resident of Jhanduk village in Bathinda district of Punjab
 unke upar bank or aadhat waalon kaa das lakh bakaayaa ho gaya tha
 Jugraj had taken a loan of Rs 1 lakh at the rate of interest of 24% per annum which had increased to Rs 3 lakh
 jugraj ko gramin bank kaa saat lakh rupaya chukaana tha
 He had also taken an old tractor on loan, but had to sell the tractor due to failure to repay the loan
 sarkaar se karz maafi kii uski ummid tut chuki thi
 When he returned from work on the farm on Friday night, he closed the room with a latch and hanged it
 beete saal usne kheton main kapaas lagaai thi lekin fasal karaab ho gai thi
 Why would someone commit suicide at the age of 62? punjab ke mukhyamantri ne 20,000 karod se adhik kii karz maafee kaa elaan kiya lekin jab bajet pesh hua to usamen kahin 20,000 karod kii raashi hi nazar nahin ai
 The Chief Minister had said that loans of up to two lakhs of all small and marginal farmers will be forgiven
 yah baat dhyaan main rakhiyegaa ki kisaanon par do lakh se adhik kaa karz he
 Even after loan waiver, farmers are not getting rid of loan
 unka puraa karz maaf nahin ho rahaa he, jabaki chunavi bhaashanon main sampurna karz maafee kii baat karte the
 The Chief Minister said before the budget that ten lakh farmers will be benefited
 daawa tha ki kareeb 56 fisadi kisaanon ko isse phayda hoga
 Accordingly, a loan waiver of 21,000 crore is made, but Finance Minister Manpreet Badal has made a provision of only 1500 crore while presenting the budget
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sabhi seemaant kisaanon ko puure do lakh rupee tak kii karz maaf kar di jaaegi chaahe un par kitna bhi karz kyon na ho
 If you add it, then it accounts for close to 30,000 crores
 bajet main us tarah se nahin kaha gaya he jaise bajet se pehle mukhyamantri ne elaan kiya tha
 Not only this, no loan will be waived for farmers with more than five acres of land
 mukhyamantri ne yah bhi kaha ki khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ke jitne bhi lone baaki honge, wo sarkaar chukaayegi
 Financial assistance of up to five lakh rupees will be given to the farmers who commit suicide
 jugraj singh agar 20 june tak zindaa hote to unka das lakh kaa karz is yojana ke tahat maaf nahin hota, ab faansee laga lee he to shaayad rajya sarkaar unka lone chukaa degi
 The Punjab government has also decided to repeal section 67A of the Punjab Cooperative Societies Act 1961
 ab kisaanon kii zamin na to nilaam hogi or na zabt
 This decision can provide relief to the farmers as there will be no fear of losing the land if they do not repay the loan
 punjab kheti ke lihaaz se ek viksit rajya he
 Every type of infrastructure is available here
 iske baad bhi yahaan ke kareeb 86 fisadi kisaan karz se dabe hai
 Of all the suicides that have taken place, this loan has been the reason for 90%
 hamaare sahyogi nikhil kii report he ki punjab ke 33
 26 percent of the farmers live below the poverty line
 yani punjab kaa har teesraa kisaan garibi rekha se neeche hai
 Earns less than Rs 2500 a month
 punjab ke kisaan parivaar par ausatan saadhe paanch lakh se zyaada karz he
 This information has been revealed in a report of Punjab University
 is project ke diarector doctor gyaan singh kaa kahana he ki seemaant kisaan, laghu kisaan, ardh laghu kisaan or bhoomihin kisaanon kii karz chukaane kii kshamta shunya ho chuki he
 They cannot be repaid
 patiala ke sohana gaanv ke kisaan paal singh kii umr 55 saal he
 He is unable to earn even 2000 months and the loan is eight lakh
 zaahir he paal singh kii karz chukaane kii kshamta samaapt ho chuki he
 This is why everyone is migrating from farming
 aap sochiye haryana ke maharishi dayanand vishvavidhyalay, rohtak main chaparasi ke 92 pad ke liye 22000 aavedan aae
 That too is not permanent
 kantrect kii naukari he or selary he 8800 rupee
 Eighth qualification is required but the students who have done MA have also applied
 aisa kyon hai
 This is because there is no employment even in cities
 shahari arthshaastri rose bol rahe hai ki logon ko kheti se hataakar shaharon main bhejnaa hoga kyonki kheti 70 fisadi logon kaa bhaar nahin uthaa sakati
 For example, in cities, employment exists on a whim
 shaharon main rojgaar nahin he, isi kaaran 70 fisadi log kheti par nirbhar he
 It can also be seen as such, but we have mastered making the matter
 haryana main nunatam mazaduri kii do daren hai
 Rs 318 and Rs 406
 in donon ke hisaab se bhi chaparasi ko nunatam mazaduri se kam vetan kaa vigyaapan nikal rahaa he wo bhi vishvavidhyalay main
 You may wonder how is the condition of minimum wages and also of employment
 ganimat he ki is desh main rojgaar mudda nahin banataa iske liye hamen dharmik or jaateey muddon kaa shukr manaanaa chahie
 Now come towards Maharashtra
 somvaar raat maharashtra sarkaar ke mantriyon ke samooh or kisaan netaaon ke bich baatcheet hui ki karz maafee kii sharten kya hongi
 Farmer leaders say that this conversation did not yield results
 unka aarope he ki sarkaar vaade se mukar rahi he
 The state government said in its proposal that the state remained dry between 2013 and 2016, so only one lakh will be waived out of the loan taken till June 30, 2016
 jin kisaanon ke paas car he, jo inakam tex bharte hai, jinke parivaar main koi sarkari karmchaaree he, unka karz maaf nahin hoga
 At the guest house where the farmer leaders were talking, they started shouting slogans and burning copies of the government's proposal
 maharashtra or punjab ne karz maafee kaa elaan to kar diya, magar itani sharten laga di gayi hai ki is maafee kaa koi khaas matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 Obviously leaders say something in elections, they do something else after elections
 is saal 18 may ke times of india main priyanka kakodakar kii ek report chhapi he, jiske anusaar maharashtra main janvari se lekar april tak 852 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 Seven farmers have committed suicide every day
 409 aatmahatyaayein vidarbha main hui hai
 In 2016, 1023 farmers committed suicide during this period
 chaar maheene main 852 kisaan aatmahatya kar len, kya aapako aisi khabaren vichlit karti hai
 On May 3, 2017, the government affidavit in the Supreme that more than 12,000 farmers have committed suicide on an average every year since 2013 in the field of agriculture, despite considerable efforts
 madhyapradesh main bhi har saal ausatan 1290 kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai
 In Tuesday's Indian Express, Ajay Vir Jakhar has written that in 2015, there was a 42% increase in farmer suicides
 yahi nahin zamin purush kisaan ke naam hoti he magar mahila kisaanon kii aatmahatya ko in aankadon main shaamil nahin kiya jaataa
 The situation of women farmers is not even discussed

 But loans are not the only problem of farmers
 35 saal ke jivan singh meena vidisha zile ke karaariya thane ke ek gaanv bamaura ke nivasee the
 Was the only child of parents
 somvaar subah unhone faansee lagaakar aatmahatya kar lee
 Jeevan had taken a loan of 1
25 lakh from Regional Rural Bank and 3 lakh from Cooperative Bank
 lone nahin chukaa sake to agali buvaai ke liye lone nahin mila, jisase ve khaad or beej nahin kareed sake
 Family members said that they were under stress
 kuch din pehle apni zamin bataaidaar ko di or somvaar ko patni or teen betiyon ko chhod faansee laga lee
 The post mortem report says that Jeevan Singh died due to suffocation ie hanging
 rashtriya aparaadh shakha beuro kii report ke anusaar 2015 main madhyapradesh main 581 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 After Jeevan Singh, now the story of Jugraj Singh
 jugraj singh punjab ke bathinda zile ke jhanduke gaanv ke rahane vaale the
 One million was owed to the bank and the commissioners
 jugraj ne aadhati se 24% salanaa byaaj par ek lakh rupaya karz liya tha jo badhkar teen lakh rupee ho gaya tha
 Jugraj was to pay Grameen Bank seven lakh rupees
 usne ek purana tractor bhi liya tha karz par, lekin karz naa chukaa paane ke kaaran tractor bechnaa padaa
 His expectation of loan waiver from the government was lost
 shuukravaar raat wo jab khet se kaam kar waapas aayaa to usne kundi lagaakar cameraa band kiya or faansee laga lee
 Last year he planted cotton in the fields, but the crop had deteriorated
 62 saal kii umr main koi khudakushi kyon karegaa? The Chief Minister of Punjab announced a loan waiver of more than 20,000 crores, but when the budget was presented, the amount of 20,000 crores could not be seen anywhere
 mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki sabhi chote or haashiye ke kisaanon ke do lakh tak ke lone maaf kar diye jaayenge
 Keep this in mind that farmers have a debt of more than two lakhs
 lone maafee ke baad bhi kisaan lone se mukt nahin ho rahe hai
 Their entire debt is not being forgiven, whereas in election speeches, the entire debt was about forgiveness
 mukhyamantri ne bajet se pehle kaha tha ki das lakh kisaanon ko phayda hoga
 It was claimed that about 56 percent of the farmers would benefit from it
 is hisaab se 21,000 karod kii karz maafee kaa hisaab banataa he, magar bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri manpreet badal ne maatr 1500 karod kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 The Chief Minister said that the loan to the extent of two lakh rupees will be waived off to all marginal farmers, no matter how much they are owed
 agar ise jod len to 30,000 karod ke kareeb hisaab baithta he
 The budget does not say the way the Chief Minister announced before the budget
 yahi nahin paanch acre se adhik zamin vaale kisaanon kaa koi lone maaf nahin hoga
 The Chief Minister also said that the government will repay all the loans of farmers who commit suicide
 khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ko paanch lakh rupee tak kii aarthik madad di jaaegi
 If Jugraj Singh was alive till June 20, his loan of one million would not be forgiven under this scheme, now that he is hanged, then perhaps the state government will repay his loan
 punjab sarkaar ne punjab kooparative societes act 1961 ke section 67 e ko bhi radd karne kaa faisalaa kiya he
 Now the land of the farmers will neither be auctioned nor seized
 is faisle se kisaanon ko raahat mil sakati he kyonki lone na chukaane par zamin chhin jane kaa dar nahin rahegaa
 Punjab is a developed state in terms of farming
 yahaan har tarah ke buniyadi dhaanche maujuud hai
 Even after this, about 86 percent of the farmers here are under debt
 jitani aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai, unamem se 90 fisadi main ye lone kaaran rahaa he
 Our colleague Nikhil reports that 33 of Punjab
 26 fisadi kisaan garibi rekha se neeche rahete hai
 That is, every third farmer of Punjab is below the poverty line
 maheene main 2500 rupee se bhi kam kamata he
 The average farm family in Punjab owes more than five and a half lakhs
 punjab uniwarsity kii ek report main yah jaankaree saamne ai he
 The director of this project, Dr
 Gyan Singh, says that the ability of marginal farmers, small farmers, semi-small farmers and landless farmers to repay loans has been reduced
 ve chukaa hi nahin sakate hai
 Farmer Pal Singh of Sohna village in Patiala is 55 years old
 vah 2000 maheenaa bhi nahin kama pate hai or karza he aath lakh
 It is clear that Pal Singh's ability to repay the loan has been exhausted
 yahi kaaran he ki kheti se sab palaayan kar rahe hai
 Think about 22000 applications for 92 posts of peon in Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana
 wo bhi sthaayee nahin he
 Contract is a job and salary is Rs 8800
 aathvin kii yogyata chahie magar eme kiye hue chaatro ne bhi aavedan kiya he
 Why is this so? aisa isliye he kyonki shaharon main bhi rojgaar nahin he
 Urban economists are speaking daily that people have to be shifted from farming to cities because farming cannot take the weight of 70 percent of the people
 jaise shaharon main rojgaar chappe-chappe par maujuud he
 There is no employment in cities, that is why 70 percent people are dependent on agriculture
 ise aise bhi dekha ja saktaa he, magar baat banane main ham ustad ho chuke hai
 There are two minimum wage rates in Haryana
 318 rupee or 406 rupee
 According to both of them, the peon is getting advertisement for less than minimum wage, that too in the university
 aap soch sakate hai ki nunatam mazaduri kaa bhi kya haal he or rojgaar kaa bhi
 It is a matter of honor that for this reason employment does not become an issue in this country, for this we should thank religious and ethnic issues
 ab aate hai maharashtra kii ore

 kisaan netaa jis guest house main baatcheet kar rahe the, vahiin par narebaazi karne lage or sarkaar ke prastaav kii pratiyaan jalaane lage

 khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ko paanch lakh rupee tak kii aarthik madad di jaaegi
 If Jugraj Singh was alive till June 20, his loan of one million would not be forgiven under this scheme, now that he is hanged, then perhaps the state government will repay his loan
 punjab sarkaar ne punjab kooparative societes act 1961 ke section 67 e ko bhi radd karne kaa faisalaa kiya he
 Now the land of the farmers will neither be auctioned nor seized
 is faisle se kisaanon ko raahat mil sakati he kyonki lone na chukaane par zamin chhin jane kaa dar nahin rahegaa
 Punjab is a developed state in terms of farming
 yahaan har tarah ke buniyadi dhaanche maujuud hai
 Even after this, about 86 percent of the farmers here are under debt
 jitani aatmahatyaayein ho rahi hai, unamem se 90 fisadi main ye lone kaaran rahaa he
 Our colleague Nikhil reports that 33 of Punjab
 26 fisadi kisaan garibi rekha se neeche rahete hai
 That is, every third farmer of Punjab is below the poverty line
 maheene main 2500 rupee se bhi kam kamata he
 The average farm family in Punjab owes more than five and a half lakhs
 punjab uniwarsity kii ek report main yah jaankaree saamne ai he
 The director of this project, Dr
 Gyan Singh, says that the ability of marginal farmers, small farmers, semi-small farmers and landless farmers to repay loans has been reduced
 ve chukaa hi nahin sakate hai
 Farmer Pal Singh of Sohna village in Patiala is 55 years old
 vah 2000 maheenaa bhi nahin kama pate hai or karza he aath lakh
 It is clear that Pal Singh's ability to repay the loan has been exhausted
 yahi kaaran he ki kheti se sab palaayan kar rahe hai
 Think about 22000 applications for 92 posts of peon in Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana
 wo bhi sthaayee nahin he
 Contract is a job and salary is Rs 8800
 aathvin kii yogyata chahie magar eme kiye hue chaatro ne bhi aavedan kiya he
 Why is this so? aisa isliye he kyonki shaharon main bhi rojgaar nahin he
 Urban economists are speaking daily that people have to be shifted from farming to cities because farming cannot take the weight of 70 percent of the people
 jaise shaharon main rojgaar chappe-chappe par maujuud he
 There is no employment in cities, that is why 70 percent people are dependent on agriculture
 ise aise bhi dekha ja saktaa he, magar baat banane main ham ustad ho chuke hai
 There are two minimum wage rates in Haryana
 318 rupee or 406 rupee
 According to both of them, the peon is getting advertisement for less than minimum wage, that too in the university
 aap soch sakate hai ki nunatam mazaduri kaa bhi kya haal he or rojgaar kaa bhi
 It is a matter of honor that for this reason employment does not become an issue in this country, for this we should thank religious and ethnic issues

 On Monday night, there was a discussion between the Maharashtra government group of ministers and farmer leaders about the terms of loan waiver
 kisaan netaaon kaa kahana he ki is baatcheet kaa nateeja nahin niklaa
 They allege that the government is reneging on the promise
 rajya sarkaar ne apane prastaav main kaha ki rajya main 2013 se 2016 ke bich sookhaa rahaa isliye 30 june 2016 tak jo karz liya gaya he usamen se sirf ek lakh maaf kiya jayega
 Farmers who have cars, who pay income tax, who have a government employee in their family, their debt will not be forgiven
 kisaan netaa jis guest house main baatcheet kar rahe the, vahiin par narebaazi karne lage or sarkaar ke prastaav kii pratiyaan jalaane lage
 Maharashtra and Punjab have announced loan waiver, but such conditions have been imposed that this pardon has no special meaning
 zaahir he netaa chunaav main kuch kehete hai, chunaav ke baad kuch or karte hai
 a report by Priyanka Kakodkar appeared in the Times of India on May 18 this year, according to which 852 farmers have committed suicide in Maharashtra from January to April
 har din saat kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 There have been 409 suicides in Vidarbha
 2016 main isi dauraan 1023 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 852 farmers commit suicide in four months, does such news disturb you
 3 may, 2017 ko supreme main sarkaar ne halafanama diya he ki kaaphi koshishon ke baad bhi krishi ke kshetra main 2013 se har saal ausatan 12,000 se zyada kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 In Madhya Pradesh too, an average of 1290 farmers are committing suicide every year
 mangalvaar ke indian express main ajay vir jakhad ne likhaa he ki 2015 main kisaanon kii aatmahatya main 42 fisadi kaa izaafaa hua tha
 Not only this, the land is named after a male farmer, but the suicide of female farmers is not included in these figures
 mahila kisaanon ke halaat par to charchaa bhi nahin hoti he
 The comments 4 april 2017 ko hindustan times main devendra sharma ne ek lekh likhaa he
 In this, he has cited the Loklakha Committee of Parliament saying that the NPA of Public Sector Bank is 6 lakh 80 thousand crore
 isamen 70 pratishat difalter udyogpati hai
 Only one percent are farmers
 aap sochiye chaar lakh ke karze vaala kisaan aatmahatya kar letaa he, yahaan pachaas pachaas hazaar karod kaa difalter udyogpati bank adhikariyon ke saath meeting kar rahe hai
 How much time the farmer gets from the bank and an industrialist should be accounted for
 magar kisaanon kii ekmaatr samasya lone nahin he
 The Chief Minister of Punjab announced a loan waiver of more than 20,000 crores, but when the budget was presented, the amount of 20,000 crores could not be seen anywhere
 mukhyamantri ne kaha tha ki sabhi chote or haashiye ke kisaanon ke do lakh tak ke lone maaf kar diye jaayenge
 Keep this in mind that farmers have a debt of more than two lakhs
 lone maafee ke baad bhi kisaan lone se mukt nahin ho rahe hai
 Their entire debt is not being forgiven, whereas in election speeches, the entire debt was about forgiveness
 mukhyamantri ne bajet se pehle kaha tha ki das lakh kisaanon ko phayda hoga
 It was claimed that about 56 percent of the farmers would benefit from it
 is hisaab se 21,000 karod kii karz maafee kaa hisaab banataa he, magar bajet pesh karte hue vitt mantri manpreet badal ne maatr 1500 karod kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 The Chief Minister said that the loan to the extent of two lakh rupees will be waived off to all marginal farmers, no matter how much they are owed
 agar ise jod len to 30,000 karod ke kareeb hisaab baithta he
 The budget does not say the way the Chief Minister announced before the budget
 yahi nahin paanch acre se adhik zamin vaale kisaanon kaa koi lone maaf nahin hoga
 The Chief Minister also said that the government will repay all the loans of farmers who commit suicide

 The Chief Minister said before the budget that ten lakh farmers will be benefited
 daawa tha ki kareeb 56 fisadi kisaanon ko isse phayda hoga
 Accordingly, a loan waiver of 21,000 crore is made, but Finance Minister Manpreet Badal has made a provision of only 1500 crore while presenting the budget
 mukhyamantri ne kaha ki sabhi seemaant kisaanon ko puure do lakh rupee tak kii karz maaf kar di jaaegi chaahe un par kitna bhi karz kyon na ho
 If you add it, then it accounts for close to 30,000 crores
 bajet main us tarah se nahin kaha gaya he jaise bajet se pehle mukhyamantri ne elaan kiya tha
 Not only this, no loan will be waived for farmers with more than five acres of land
 mukhyamantri ne yah bhi kaha ki khudakushi karne vaale kisaanon ke jitne bhi lone baaki honge, wo sarkaar chukaayegi
 Financial assistance of up to five lakh rupees will be given to the farmers who commit suicide
 jugraj singh agar 20 june tak zindaa hote to unka das lakh kaa karz is yojana ke tahat maaf nahin hota, ab faansee laga lee he to shaayad rajya sarkaar unka lone chukaa degi
 The Punjab government has also decided to repeal section 67A of the Punjab Cooperative Societies Act 1961
 ab kisaanon kii zamin na to nilaam hogi or na zabt
 This decision can provide relief to the farmers as there will be no fear of losing the land if they do not repay the loan
 punjab kheti ke lihaaz se ek viksit rajya he
 Every type of infrastructure is available here
 iske baad bhi yahaan ke kareeb 86 fisadi kisaan karz se dabe hai
 Of all the suicides that have taken place, this loan has been the reason for 90%
 hamaare sahyogi nikhil kii report he ki punjab ke 33

 yani punjab kaa har teesraa kisaan garibi rekha se neeche hai

 tippaniyan On 4 April 2017, Devendra Sharma has written an article in Hindustan Times
 isamen unhone sansad kii loklekha samiti kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki public sector bank kaa enpie chah lakh 80 hazaar karod kaa he
 70 percent of the defaulters are industrialists
 maatr ek fisadi kisaan hai
 You think a farmer with a debt of four lakh commits suicide, here the defaulter industrialist of fifty fifty thousand crore is meeting with bank officials
 kisaan ko bank se kitna vakt miltaa he or ek udyogpati ko isi kaa hisaab nikaala janaa chahie
 But loans are not the only problem of farmers
 yahi kaaran he ki kheti se sab palaayan kar rahe hai
 Think about 22000 applications for 92 posts of peon in Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak, Haryana
 wo bhi sthaayee nahin he
 Contract is a job and salary is Rs 8800
 aathvin kii yogyata chahie magar eme kiye hue chaatro ne bhi aavedan kiya he
 Why is this so? aisa isliye he kyonki shaharon main bhi rojgaar nahin he
 Urban economists are speaking daily that people have to be shifted from farming to cities because farming cannot take the weight of 70 percent of the people
 jaise shaharon main rojgaar chappe-chappe par maujuud he
 There is no employment in cities, that is why 70 percent people are dependent on agriculture
 ise aise bhi dekha ja saktaa he, magar baat banane main ham ustad ho chuke hai
 There are two minimum wage rates in Haryana
 318 rupee or 406 rupee
 According to both of them, the peon is getting advertisement for less than minimum wage, that too in the university
 aap soch sakate hai ki nunatam mazaduri kaa bhi kya haal he or rojgaar kaa bhi
 It is a matter of honor that for this reason employment does not become an issue in this country, for this we should thank religious and ethnic issues
 ab aate hai maharashtra kii ore
 On Monday night, there was a discussion between the Maharashtra government group of ministers and farmer leaders about the terms of loan waiver
 kisaan netaaon kaa kahana he ki is baatcheet kaa nateeja nahin niklaa
 They allege that the government is reneging on the promise
 rajya sarkaar ne apane prastaav main kaha ki rajya main 2013 se 2016 ke bich sookhaa rahaa isliye 30 june 2016 tak jo karz liya gaya he usamen se sirf ek lakh maaf kiya jayega
 Farmers who have cars, who pay income tax, who have a government employee in their family, their debt will not be forgiven
 kisaan netaa jis guest house main baatcheet kar rahe the, vahiin par narebaazi karne lage or sarkaar ke prastaav kii pratiyaan jalaane lage
 Maharashtra and Punjab have announced loan waiver, but such conditions have been imposed that this pardon has no special meaning
 zaahir he netaa chunaav main kuch kehete hai, chunaav ke baad kuch or karte hai
 a report by Priyanka Kakodkar appeared in the Times of India on May 18 this year, according to which 852 farmers have committed suicide in Maharashtra from January to April
 har din saat kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 There have been 409 suicides in Vidarbha
 2016 main isi dauraan 1023 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii thi
 852 farmers commit suicide in four months, does such news disturb you
 3 may, 2017 ko supreme main sarkaar ne halafanama diya he ki kaaphi koshishon ke baad bhi krishi ke kshetra main 2013 se har saal ausatan 12,000 se zyada kisaanon ne aatmahatya kii he
 In Madhya Pradesh too, an average of 1290 farmers are committing suicide every year
 mangalvaar ke indian express main ajay vir jakhad ne likhaa he ki 2015 main kisaanon kii aatmahatya main 42 fisadi kaa izaafaa hua tha
 Not only this, the land is named after a male farmer, but the suicide of female farmers is not included in these figures
 mahila kisaanon ke halaat par to charchaa bhi nahin hoti he
 The comments 4 april 2017 ko hindustan times main devendra sharma ne ek lekh likhaa he
 In this, he has cited the Loklakha Committee of Parliament saying that the NPA of Public Sector Bank is 6 lakh 80 thousand crore
 isamen 70 pratishat difalter udyogpati hai
 Only one percent are farmers
 aap sochiye chaar lakh ke karze vaala kisaan aatmahatya kar letaa he, yahaan pachaas pachaas hazaar karod kaa difalter udyogpati bank adhikariyon ke saath meeting kar rahe hai
 How much time the farmer gets from the bank and an industrialist should be accounted for
 magar kisaanon kii ekmaatr samasya lone nahin he
 Now come towards Maharashtra
 somvaar raat maharashtra sarkaar ke mantriyon ke samooh or kisaan netaaon ke bich baatcheet hui ki karz maafee kii sharten kya hongi
 Farmer leaders say that this conversation did not yield results
 unka aarope he ki sarkaar vaade se mukar rahi he
 The state government said in its proposal that the state remained dry between 2013 and 2016, so only one lakh will be waived out of the loan taken till June 30, 2016
 jin kisaanon ke paas car he, jo inakam tex bharte hai, jinke parivaar main koi sarkari karmchaaree he, unka karz maaf nahin hoga
 At the guest house where the farmer leaders were talking, they started shouting slogans and burning copies of the government's proposal
 maharashtra or punjab ne karz maafee kaa elaan to kar diya, magar itani sharten laga di gayi hai ki is maafee kaa koi khaas matlab nahin rah jaataa he
 Obviously leaders say something in elections, they do something else after elections

 mumbai hamale se pehle kii ye choti-si ghatana bataati he ki kyon amitabh bachchan abhinay kaa ek muhaavara ban chukaa he
 Amitabh Bachchan, who spent decades in the film world, like other actors, avoided the small screen at a time when TV was new
 lekin chote parade kaa kamaal dekhie ki amitabh bachchan kaa karier jab bilkul dhalaan par aa gaya to tivi ne hi unako lifline di
 By then this angry man was super cool
 ek budhimaan or sanskari abhinayta ke taur par amitabh kii pahchaan janata main he
 The makers still want to sign Amitabh
 shaayad ye amitabh pehle kalakaar honge jinhen chaar pidiyon ne parade par dekha he or ve ab bhi sakriy hai
 Otherwise four generations have heard the names of many artists but have not actively seen them
 rajeev gandhi se lekar narendra modi tak ke saath meljol kaa tajurba rakhane vaale bhi shaayad ve iklaute kalakaar honge (lata mangeshkar gayika hai)
 Then we must have been studying in primary school when Amitabh Bachchan's coolie came and he had an accident
 tab har jagah amitabh kii sehat kii charchaa hoti thi
 Special prayers were held in every city to protect them
 jab tak unke khatre se baahar aane kii soochna nahin aa gai, tab tak har gali main chaay kii dukaanon par, gharon main, daftaron main bas amitabh bachchan kii charchaa hoti thi
 The second example of such an extreme concern for the health of an actor was not seen
 amitabh bachchan kii pehali film hamane skool se gaayab hokar video par dekhi thi-sholay
 This was seen because classmates used to discuss Sholay a lot and we felt some friends that if they did not see Sholay, life is useless
 isi vajah se ye film dekhi
 He also watched films like Lal Badshah and Storm type but did not land
 nae daur main amitabh ne behatar story vaali filmein kin jinamein piku or shamitabh bilkul alag nikaleen
 Shamitabh was a completely different story around which no other film was made
 baharhaal, is daur main bhi amitabh ke diwane ji rahe hai
 Not knowing how many of his dialogues were copied in his hobby and then it became his means of livelihood
 inamen kuch prasiddh hue to kuch nahin
 Those who imitate Amitabh's clothes and beard will still be easily seen in every public place
 baharhaal, is kalakaar ko dada sahib phalke aword milanaa prasannataa kii baat he par lagata he ye thodi der se mila

 Increasing Chinese intervention in the Indian sub-continent This study is going to be dynamic in view of the continuously increasing Chinese interference in South Asia and the Indian sub-continent
 padosi deshon main badhate chini nivesh ke akalan ke saath anya trends kaa bhi vishleshan kiya jayega
 According to the data of the Government of Pakistan, Chinese FDI 256 in 2014-15

 The Belt and Road Initiative is also known as One Belt One Road or OBOR

 The $ 50 billion china-pakistan Economic Corridor passes through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir
 centre sarkaar bangladesh, bhutan, myamar, nepal, pakistan or srilanka main chini nivesh kii prakruti or prabhaav kaa bhi vishleshan karegi
 In addition, Chinese investment in Afghanistan and Maldives will also be studied
 haalanki is adhyayan main sabase badi baadha padosi deshon ke salanaa epadiai or chini epadiai kaa vistrut data na hona he
 Pakistan will get market from CPEC According to Professor Vishwajit Dhar at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Chinese investment can reach Pakistan in the market of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, where it can challenge Indian companies
 in deshon main bharat ek ahm khilaadi he
 Professor Dhar says that the China Pakistan Economic Corridor Project can connect Pakistan to the Central Asia Republic (CAR)
 isse pakistan ko in bazaaron main apane paanv jamaane main madad mil sakati he
 Political and strategic CPEC According to a special report of a workshop on 'china and South Asia' conducted by the Institute of South Asian Studies of the National University of Singapore, Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang considers China to be part of South Asia in many ways
 report ke mutabik dakshin asian deshon ke saath china kaa maujuuda sahyog van belt van road niti kaa ahm hissaa he
 Xianliang, however, denies that the One Belt One Road project has any strategic or political motive
 report kahati he ki bharat china ke spashtikaran par vishwaas nahin karata ki china kaa van belt van road project sirf aarthik uddeshyon ko lekar chal rahaa he
 ISAS editor P
 es
 Suryanarayana says that the china-pakistan Economic Corridor has strategic objectives
 pakistan adhikrut kashmir main ban rahe kai projectoni dilli sthiti rashtriya suraksha or dephence sarvice think tanks united sarvice institution of india (yuasai) kaa maananaa he ki jahaan tak bharat kii chintaaon kaa sawaal he to china pakistan aarthik coridor ne is vishay ko pechida bana diya he
 Under this project, many projects are being built in Pakistan occupied Kashmir without India's consent and this is what makes this project politically important
 pakistan kaa karj na chukaa paanaa baari padegaa!yuasai kaa adhyayan kahata he ki agar china pakistan aarthik coridor or van belt van road project kshetra ke aarthik vikaas ke liye he to china ko is par purnvichaar karnaa chahie or pakistan adhikrut kashmir se nivesh ko waapas lenaa chahie
 The USI further states that it does not seem possible for Pakistan to repay the investment of china-pakistan Economic Corridor within the given time
 aise main yah karja china ke liye yah ranneetik hissaa ban jayega, khaas taur par guadar bandargah
 
 
 And this raises security concerns in South Asia
 bataa den ki china paak aarthik coridor ke tahat port sector main guadar bandargah kaa vikaas sabase mahatvapurn he
