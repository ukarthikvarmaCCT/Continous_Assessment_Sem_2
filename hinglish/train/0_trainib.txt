 " Badrinath and Kedarnath Dham in Uttarakhand are in the news nowadays for different reasons
 badrinaath dham ke garbhagrih kii chat ko sone se mayaae kii peshkash karne vaale udyogpati gupta bandhuon par uth rahe sawaal ke chalate mandir samiti ab rajya sarkaar se paraamarsh maang rahi he
 The state government is losing ground by saying that the temple committee is able to decide on its own, whose donation it should not
 dakshin africa ke raashtrapati jaikab juma ke kareebi rahe gupta bandhu tray-ajay, rajesh or atul gupta kathith bhrashtachar ke aaropon main pravartan nideshaalay kii jaanch kaa saamana kar rahe hai
 The Income Tax Department has also conducted raids on several locations of the Gupta brothers, originally from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh
 so, badri-kedaar mandir samiti ke adhyaksh ganesh godiyal ne samiti kaa gathan karne vaale rajya sarkaar ke dharmasv samskruti vibhaag ko patr likhakar poocha he, ‘‘agar gupta bandhu apane prastaav ke anuroop mandir main daan chadhaane aate hai to use sweekaar kiya jaae yaa nahin
 Godiyal is a former Congress MLA
 godiyal ke anusaar, gupta bandhu pichley saal badrinaath ke darshan ke liye aae the
 During one story, he offered to offer gold leaf on the roof of the sanctum sanctorum of Badrinath temples
 is peshkash ko pichley saal 27 november ko mandir samiti board kii baithak main sarvasammati se sweekaar kar liya gaya tha
 According to the chairman, at that time there was no information to the committee of any allegations against the Gupta brothers
 lekin 15 may se badrinaath main gupta bandhu katha yojit karne kii koshish kar rahe hai jisase vivaad jor pakadta ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, during the opening of the kapat in Kedarnath, Godiyal, president of the temple committee, lodged an objection to the laser show held there and called it a violation of the traditions
 ‘aadi anant shiv’ sheershak vaala lager sho shraddhaluon ke aakarshan kaa centre to jarur bana lekin congress ne kaha ki isamen pradhanmantri narendra modi kii branding vaale hisse ko hataaya jaae
 Godiyal claims that this part of Modi's campaign was removed from the show only after his protests during the trial
 haalanki sho taiyaar karne vaale akshar group ke chairman manish sharma isse saaf inkaar karte hai
 The Akshar Group, in collaboration with the National Antyodaya Union, has created this unique laser show of its kind
 kapaat khulne se pehle 28 april ko kedarnath main is sho kaa trial kiya gaya
 But Godiyal objected that it cannot be made a means of political propaganda
 unki aapatti kul 22 minute ke sho main us 5 minute ke hisse par thi jisamen mandir navnirmaan main pradhanmantri modi ke prayaason kii prashansa kii gai he
 Later this part was banned
 yah sho mandir kii deevaaron par dikhaaya ja rahaa he
 Temple Committee Chief Executive B
 di
 Singh makes it clear that the government allowed the laser show and not the temple committee
 godiyal kii daleel he ki chaahe bhaajapa ho yaa congress, mandir ko ham raajnneeti kaa akhaada nahin banane denge
 He asked the laser show company to remove this part and said that they will not allow this laser show to be held until this part is removed
 samiti ke adhyaksh ne kaha, ‘‘yah kedaar kaa darbar he, isamen chaahe koi pradhanmantri ho yaa raashtrapati, kisi ko bhi apane vigyaapan dikhaane kaa adhikaar nahin he
 "he said that the faith of crores of people is associated with this temple:" We asked the Gujarat company to show this laser show in Kedarnath, a symbol of faith, to show any story related to Lord Shiva on the walls of the temple
 Can, but if it will be used as a party advertisement, then we will not let it run
 ’’donon vivaadon se rajya sarkaar khud ko alag rakhane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The BJP is also avoiding giving it much weight because the people of both the dhams are connected

 Dharmendra was ranked among the world's most handsome men in the mid-1970s
 dharmendra world aayran main award se bhi navaaje ja chuke hai

 agar aap ye sochati hai ki khaanaa kha lene maatr se aapke sharir ko poshan mil gaya he to aapako bataa den ki aisa nahin he
 Food is a step of nutrition
 jab tak khaanaa acchhee tarah pach na jaae or uske poshak tatv sharir main abjarv na ho jaaen poshan kii prakriya puri nahin hoti
 In such a situation, after eating food, no work should be done which will have the opposite effect instead of getting nutrition
 yahaan ham apko aisi saat baaten bataa rahe hai jinhenkhaane ke baad karnaa khatarnaak sabitaho saktaa he
 If you do something like this, then stop doing them now for good health
 1
 Do not drink cigarette cigarette is a bad addiction in itself, which causes many heart and respiratory diseases at home
 par exparts kii maane to khaane ke thik baad smoke karnaa das guna khatarnaak ho saktaa he
 a cigarette drank after a meal usually causes the equivalent of 10 cigarettes consumed
 saath hi isse cancer kaa khatra bhi kaaphi bad jaataa he
 2
 khaane ke turant baad na khaaen faedgar aap khaane ke saath hi fal khate hai to fal pet main hi chipak jate hai or sahi tareeke se intestin tak nahin pahunch pate hai
 In such a situation, the nutrition received from them remains incomplete
 isi aadhaar par kaha jaataa he ki khaane ke kareeb ek ghante baad falon kaa seven karnaa chahie yaa phir khaane ke kuch ghante pehle ise khaaya ja saktaa he
 It is best to eat fruit on an empty stomach in the morning
 3
 Avoid tea
 Tea leaves have high acidification
 isse protein ke pachan par asar padataa or wo aasaani se diguest nahin ho paata he
 In such a situation, we should try to drink tea only after one to two hours of eating
 4
 Do not loosen your belt, we often loosen our belt upon seeing the food of choice
 iskaa saaf matlab ye he ki aap jarurat se zyada kha rahe hai
 Oversighting is not a good thing in any sense
 isliye koshish karen ki utana hi khaaen jitne kii bhukh ho varanaa ye apach kaa kaaran bhi ban saktaa he
 5
 turant na nahayennhana ek shaareerik kriya he
 During this time the hands and feet are in active state, which increases the blood flow of these organs significantly
 in angon main blad flo badhane se pet main rudhir pravaah par asar padataa he or pachan kriya prabhavit hoti he
 6
 turant tahalne na jaaenkhaane ke baad tahalnaa ek acchhee aadat he lekin khaane ke turant baad tahalne se pachan kriya par asar padataa he
 Walking burns the energy of our body while digestion is also required inside the body
 aise main khaane ke kuch der baad tahalnaa ek acchhee kriya ho sakati he par khaane ke saath hi tahalne nikal janaa ulta asar daal saktaa7
 Do not sleep immediately It takes some time to digest the food
 aise main koshish kerani chahie ki khaane ke turant baad soen nahin
 This increases the risk of gas and intestinal infections

 The heartbeat of students is increasing due to tension
 vahiin zyada tension students kii salbhar kii taiyaariyon par bura prabhaav daal saktaa he
 In fact, experts believe this and many studies have also proved that due to high tension, a person's memory is weakened and this affects his ability to think and make decisions
 vahiin agar aap tanavamukt pariksha dena chaahate hai to padhai ke saath-saath pariksha ke dauraan ye kaam bhi karne honge
 Make sure to do these worksite breaks during the exam- time is short and you have to do more preparation but this does not mean that you cannot take a break in between studies

 Take a break from studies and watch some comedy programs
 Board Exam 2018: pariksha se pehle aise rakhen khud ko relaxphone band kar den-padhai karte hue vaise bhi phone se dur hi rahanaa chahie

 lashkar-e-taiba is preparing a group of 21 women militants in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir training camps
 sena sutron ne mangalvaar ko yah jaankaree di
 An army officer said, 'we have confirmed reports that lashkar-e-taiba is training 21 women terrorists in its training camps in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan occupied Kashmir to carry out terrorist incidents in India
 ’ unhone kaha ki nae gut ko dukhatreen-e-taiyaba naam diya gaya he or lashkar kii yojana is gut ko kashmir ghati main sakriy karne kii he
 Recently there were reports that women terrorists were present in 42 training camps located in pok
 mahila aatankwaadiyon kii yojana uri sector yaa anya desh ke madhyam se hawaii maarg ke jariye bharat main ghuspaith karne kii he
 Sources said that the mastermind of the Mumbai terror attacks is Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi behind the creation of the female terrorist group
 unhone kaha ki jammu kashmir main suraksha balon ke haathon kai sheersh aatankwaadiyon ke maare jane se aatankwaadi guton ko baari jhatka laga he
 He said that he also plans to recruit local youths
 Jabra ne june ke maheene main bharat main apane neckband style vaale nae hedset ko launch kiya tha
 This is an upgraded version of the company's old headset model Jabra Elite 25e
 ise bhi neckbanddizinvaala hi banaaya gaya he
 The company has priced this headset at Rs 7,499
 hamane ise kaaphi lambey samay tak upyog kiya he or ab ham iskaa rivyuu aap tak pahunchaa rahe hai
 Here we will tell you whether you should buy Bluetooth headset
 dizin or bild quality:dizin or bilt donon hi aria main ye hedset behad kamaal he
 That is, the way plastic is used and is quite premium
 saath hi jis vir kaa upyog kiya gaya he wo bhi kaaphi shandaar he
 Saying brilliant means both look and comfort
 isamen khaas taur par memory vir kaa upyog kiya gaya he, jisase ise bahut zyada fold karne ke baavjood ye apana shape waapas le lete hai
 The special thing is that it is designed with a neckband style, so that it can be used easily for calling
 aise puraane model kii baat karen to vahaan nek main ek mote plastic body kaa upyog kiya gaya tha, jabaki yahaan yahaan patale memory vir kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 The earphones on both sides are designed with a special angle for better fitting in the ears
 saath hi yeartips bhi graahakon ko alag-alag sies main mil jaaenge
 Also, let us know that magnets are provided in the back of both earphones, so that both earphones can be kept sticking if not used
 saath hi ye kai function bhi karte hai
 Talking about the buttons given in this headset, there are multi buttons and volume buttons in one side microphone
 saath hi yahaan lite indicater bhi maujuud he
 These are used for receiving calls, cutting, redialing, reverse-forwarding music tracks, and reducing volume
 saath hi yahaan virtual assistant ko active karne ke liye van tach batan bhi diya gaya he
 Performance and Sound: This headset is designed to facilitate better calling via Bluetooth
 jahaan tak connactivity kii baat yahaan bluetooth connactivity bilkul nahin jaati
 Talking about the sound quality during the call, it is also very clear
 isamen nois canselation ke liye khaastaur par do microphons kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 That is, the person you are talking to on the other end can hear your voice better even in very crowded area and the company has also achieved this feature in a much better way
 iske alaava ab baat karen isamen maujuud magnets kii to jaise hi aap magnet ko atech karte hai ye hedset puri tarah of ho jaataa he
 When you separate these magnets, it connects back to your device
 lekin ye function meri samaj se ek samasya he
 First thing because if you remove this headset and put it in a bag somewhere and you have not manually turned it off, then it connects automatically without your knowledge
 duusari baat ye ki puraane model Elite 25e main magnet atech hone ke baad bhi hedset smartphone se connected rahata tha, isse koi bhi kol aane par jaise hi aap magnet alag karenge phone sidhe risive ho jaataa tha
 But after disconnecting the magnets here, the headset takes time to connect to the device, which takes time to pick up the phone
 yani hedset conect hone tak aapako intjaar karnaa hoga
 People usually pick up on seeing the phone directly
 iske alaava puraane model kii hi tulana is model kii baat karen to colling kii tamaam acchhee technology ke baavjood mujhe ye thodaa naakaam laga
 The first reason was the connectivity of the magnets
 ab duusari ye ki puraane model main ek badi plastic neckband body di gai thi jo kol aane par khud-ba-khud wibratt hone lagata thi
 In such a situation, the information about the call was received
 yahaan jab tak phone kii ringtone naa sun len yaa hedset ko kaanon par lagaaya ho isaki jaankaree nahin milti
 In such a situation, you have to keep the phone's vibration or ringtone on or watch the phone again and again
 jabaki puraane model main baar-baar phone tach karne kii jarurat nahin mahasoos hoti thi
 Also, let us tell you that the caller's number is told on the arrival of a call in this headset, while there is a need to tell his name because every person remembers the name, it is more difficult to remember the whole number
 iske alaava is hedset se kol karne ke dauraan vatting kol kii jaankaree nahin milti aise main aap kisi se lambey samay tak baat karen hon to ho saktaa he aapkaa vatting main aa rahaa he jaruri kol miss ho jaae
 Apart from all this, the most problem came in calling where if you speak even a little while talking to a person, then the person does not know the voice
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi mahasoos hua ki bydaree kam hone par jor se baat karne par bhi saamne vaale ko jaraa kam aawaaj aati he
 In such a situation, it is possible to bring the mic closer to the mouth, or you will have to speak louder
 ab iske baad agar ham is hedset ke audio quality kii baat karen to ise bhi aap bahut behatar nahin kah sakate
 Because at the price at which it is being sold, a better audio output can be expected
 sabase badi kami audio ko lekar iskaa laud naa hona he
 That is, even with a better audio player, you will miss a little loudness
 haalanki puri tarah se aawaaj ko badhaane ke baavjood aapako kisi tarah nois nahin milegaa, joki ek positive point he
 Apart from this, its base quality and surround will disappoint you
 aap ise local headphone vaali category main to nahin daal sakate lekin panchi base or saround ko miss karenge
 This headphone has more tilt for Treble
 yani aap kul milakar isse ek flats audio quality se zyada kuch nahin paaenge
 Also, users can adjust some settings from the Jabra Sound + app
 haalanki yahaan bhi kuch magical aapako haath nahin lagegaa
 Battery: The company claims that this headphone can be run up to 8 hours after a single charge and here the company's claim justifies
 haalanki nois canselation ke saath isaki bydaree lagbhag 6 ghante tak saath detii he
 That is, its performance is much better in terms of a Bluetooth headset
 khaas baat ye bhi he ki 15 minute kii charging ke baad ise kareeb aadhe ghante tak chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Verdict: The price range in which this device is placed in the Bluetooth headset category, it can prove to be expensive to buy
 kyonki audio quality ke lihaaj se isaki parformens kaaphi aakarshak nahin he, naa hi colling ke liye is hedset hamane behatar paaya he
 As far as build quality and look are concerned, it is much better
 saath hi bydaree bhi jaldi saath nahin chhodti
 In such a situation, other products available in the market can be tried

 We should stand by and make Rahin Yakub Memon a member of Parliament and let him become the voice of the helpless

 is
 priyanka gandhi ne kaha ki notebandi ek aapadaa thi, jinase hamaari arthvyavastha nasht kar di
 3 years since # Demonetisationand every claim made by the government and those hailing it as a slayer of all evils has been turned on its head
 It proved to be a disaster that has all but destroyed our economy
 Whoever wants to claim responsibility? Farmers, youth and employment were all affected
 maine pehle hi din kaha tha ki isse arthvyavastha or logon kii jindagi barbaad hogi
 Mamta said that even today experts are acknowledging the loss of demonetisation
 Today is the third anniversary of # demonetisationdisaster
 Within minutes of announcement, i had said that it will ruin the economy and the lives of millions
 Renowned economists, common people & all experts now agree
 Figures from RBI have also shown it was a futile exercise 1 / 2— Mamata Banerjee (@mamataofficial) November 8, 2019 What did Mayawati say after completing 3 years of demonetisation? uttarakhand main 31 janvari ke baad matadaata suchi main nae naam jodne kaa kaam shuru hua or usamen mahila matadaataaon ne khaasi ruchi dikhaai he

 pradesh kii almoda sansadeey seat par chaar or paudi sansadeey seat par do vidhansabha siten aisi hai jahaan mahila matadaata purush matadaata kii tulana main adhik hai
 Apart from this, there are five assembly seats where there is no difference of one thousand between male and female voters
 paudi loksabhaa seat kii baat karen to yahaan kedarnath or chubattakhaal do aisi vidhansabhaayen hai jahaan mahila matadaata purushon kii tulana main adhik hai
 There is a difference of only 500 between male and female voters in the Karnprayag and Rudraprayag assembly
 almoda loksabhaa seat main dharchula, pithauragarh, didihat or dvaarahaat vidhansabha kshetra main mahila matadaataaon kii sankhya purushon se adhik he
 Women may be marginalized in Uttarakhand in terms of political representation, but they have played a leading role in the social movements here
 paryaavaran bachaane ke liye jal jameen jangal ke muddon ke liye chipko aandolan ho yaa phir pruthak rajya kaa aandolan mahilaon kii bhoomika ahm rahi he
 Women also had a very inspiring role in the movement to protect the young generation from the ill-effects of drug addiction and to provide employment not drug addiction

 Rejecting the criticism of holding the Common Entrance Test (JEE) for iits and other central institutions from next year, the government said that it was agreed with the consent of the IIT Council meeting and four out of seven iits were sent to the Senate

 mumbai test ke pehle team india ke openar murali vijay kaa kharaab form (?) logon kii chintaa kaa kaaran bataaya ja rahaa tha
 There were reports in the media that the England fast bowlers are not only harassing Vijay by using the 'asra' of short pitch balls but are also able to get out
 lagaataar ek yaa do match main naakaami ke baad hi shuru hone vaale aalochana ke is daur main log (media or cricket sameekshak bhi) is baat ko lagbhag bhul hi gaye the ki inhen vijay ne rajkot test main behtareen shatak jamaaya tha
 It is surprising that even before the start of the fourth test of the india-england series, that best innings of the first test was forgotten
 baharhaal, murali vijay kii ballebaaji par uthe in sawaalon ke baad bhi coach anil kumble apane openar ko lekar aashwast dikhe
 In the first media briefing of the Mumbai Test, he spoke openly in favor of Vijay
 'jambo' ne kaha tha, 'vijay ke haal main short pich gendon par out hone ko unki kamajori maananaa sahi nahin hoga
 Vijay has been our consistent performer in the last two years
 usne rajkot main shatak banaaya tha
 Yes, he was out on similar balls, so you can show this as his weakness but i believe it is not right
 vah aisa ballebaaj he jiske bare main hamen lagata he ki vah jald hi bada score banayega
 'kumble also said that the team management has looked at the batting of Murali Vijay on the net and is helping him
 tippaniyan Murali Vijay justified Kumble's statement today
 match ke duusare din shatak puraa karte hue unhone apane aalochakon ke munh band kar die
 Vijay played a really good innings
 haalanki match ke pehle din apane ardhashatak se pehle vijay ne england team ko ek mauka bhi diya tha jab adil raashid kii gend par wicketiper beresto unhen stump karne se chook gaye the
 It seems that Muqaddar was also in favor of Vijay getting a big score and proving Coach Kumble's point right
 vijay kaa form main aana ( is lihaaj se ki aalochak unke form par sawaal uthaa rahe the) bhartiya team management ke liye acchhee khabar he
 Opening partnership in the series so far has been a cause for concern for Team India
 ummid he ki vijay ke balle se phir ran nikalne ke baad aage ke ballebaajon par se dabaav hatega
 
 
 However, even after these questions raised on the batting of Murali Vijay, coach Anil Kumble was confident about his opener
 mumbai test ke pehle media brifing main ve vijay ke paksh main khulkar bole
 'jumbo' had said, 'it would not be right to consider Vijay's recent dismissal on short pitch balls
 vijay pichley do varshon main hamaara lagaataar acha pradarshan karne vaala ballebaaj rahaa he
 He scored a century in Rajkot
 haa, vah ek jaisi gendon par out hua,isliye aap ise uski kamajori ke rup main dikhaa sakate hai lekin meraa maananaa he ki yah sahi nahin he
 He is such a batsman that we think he will score big soon
 ’ kumble ne yah bhi kaha tha ki team prabandhan net par murali vijay kii ballebaaji par nigaah jamaaye he or unki madad kar rahaa he
 The comments kumble kii kahi baat ko murali vijay ne aaj sahi sabit kiya
 He silenced his critics while completing a century on the second day of the match
 vijay ne vaaki behtareen pari kheli
 However, before his half-century on the first day of the match, Vijay also gave the England team a chance when wicketkeeper Bairstow missed a ball off Adil Rashid
 aisa lagata he ki mukaddar bhi vijay ke bada score banane or coach kumble kii baat sahi sabit hone ke paksh main tha
 Vijay's coming into form (in the sense that critics were questioning his form) is good news for the Indian team management
 siries main ab tak opening saajhedaari team india ke liye chintaa kaa kaaran rahi he
 It is expected that after Vijay's bat runs out again, the pressure on the forward batsmen will be removed

 Do you believe this? i agree and feel good that now i will bet on a grassroots leader
 aap to sangh ko bahut achche se jaanate hai, aapako lagata he, vah modi kaa saath degaa?sangh narendra modi ko project karegaa
 You will have trouble if Modi comes? We have no threat from Narendra Modi

 This is possible only when the attention of tourists is drawn to the villages of Mithilanchal

 The income from this will be completely right to the owner of the house

 He said that apart from this, many famous arts including the lathi industry will also be included in the rural tourism scheme

 Painting experts also believe that over time its subject is changing

e
 freedom of expression and 19 (2) (restrictions)

 Commenting on the rape victim, Justice Deepak Mishra asked the question, 'is Article 19 (1) (a) and 19 (2) of the Constitution complete? Does any person who is in a constitutional or state office have the right to comment on the victim of a heinous crime like rape, which affects the constitutional rights of the victim? ' The court said, 'such commentary on women is a constitutional question because she is going through a problem in which her own dignity has been affected
 'bayaanbaji par aapraadhik abhiyojan nahinis pachhatorni general mukul rohtagi ne kahaaki is tarah ke coment par koi aapraadhik abhiyojan nahin ho saktaa kyonki abhi tak is tarah ke maamle ke liye koi kanoon nahin he
 If this happens, no one will be able to speak anything

 The court said that the statement made in Parliament is not within the purview of the court
 court kii taraf se ye bhi poocha gaya ki koi kanoon naa hone kii vajah se kya koi kuch bhi tippanee kar saktaa he
 The help court sought from senior advocate Harish Salve also said that if an FIR is lodged as an example, can an officer like a director general of police comment that this is the result of a political conspiracy

 vaigyanikon ne ek aisa krantikari upkaran banane kaa daawa kiya he, jisaki madad se netraheen log apane kaanon kii madad se dekh sakenge
 In fact, this device with sensors will train the brain to create an image by hearing the name of something and in this case blind and partially sighted people can see images through sounds
 tippaniyan a team of researchers from the University of Bath in the UK called Dr
 maaikel praks kii rahanumai main is baat kaa pataa lagaaya ki is upkaran kii madad se ankhon kii jaanch ke dauraan drushtibaadhit logon ne kis tarah se pratikriya di
 The participants in this trial identified the images better with the help of this special device and that too when they were not given much training to use this tool
 vaigyanikon ko ummid he ki is upkaran ke istemaal kaa paryaapt prashikshan die jane ke baad yah netraheenon ko kaanon se ‘dekhne’ kii kshamta pradaan kar saktaa he
 Scientists have claimed to make such a revolutionary device, with the help of which blind people can see with the help of their ears
 darasal, sensor yukt yah upkaran dimag ko is baat ke liye prashikshit karegaa ki vah kisi cheez kaa naam sunakar uski chhavi bana de or aisa hone par netraheen or aanshik rup se drushtibaadhit logon ko dhvaniyon ke madhyam se chhaviyaan dikh sakengi

 Scientists hope that after adequate training in the use of this device can provide the ability of the blind to 'see' through the ears

 Hey, Danyelle Suzanne Solie at The Farley Center in Norfolk, VA - I've read your "intentions" & bs
 You do not have an MD in psychiatry & have no right 2 determine if any patient is faking pain or symptoms
 Just do ur damn job before you hurt someone! # patientsarenotfakinga lot of y'all "nurses" should've picked a different career
 
 
 is post ko dekhne ke baad kuch logon ne apane saath hue vaakyon ko bhi share kiya
 In this, he told that the same has happened to him when the doctors did not consider his problem as 'serious'
 is bare main bataate hue ek yujar ne likhaa, ''maine kai doctor or nurse ko dikhaaya jinhen lag rahaa tha ki main pet dard kaa naatak kar rahi hum kyonki mujhe drugs chahie lekin baad main saamne aayaa ki meri owari main sist fat gai thi
 Even though this is not a very big problem, but because of this, the pain in the abdomen hurts more than the pain that occurs when giving birth to a child ''
 i had several white doctors / nurses think i was faking some serious mofo pain, because they assumed i wanted drugs
 Turns out i had an ovarian cyst burst
 Not a giant emergency, but easily pain worse than childbirth (I have three kids)
 So no, ya can't! At the same time some people feel that the woman is being trolled and given the wrong reasons on this joking video

 a Delhi school student committed suicide by getting upset
 chaatra ke parijanon ne do adhyapakon or skool prashasan par gambhir aarope lagaae hai
 Now the matter has reached the Legislative Assembly
 shiksha mantri manish sisodiya ne sadan ko bataaya ki maamle main adhikariyon ko jaanch ke aadesh die gaye hai
 Meanwhile, opposition leader Vijender Gupta has demanded to submit the report within 3 days
 manish sisodiya ne kaha, 'ek bacchee ne aatmahatya kii he, yah samaaj ke liye ek badi samasya he
 At present, many officials of the department are currently investigating the matter in the school
 lekin abhi maamle kii koi pukhta jaankaree nahin he
 But as soon as the report comes, it will be presented in the House
 shiksha mantri manish sisodiya ne adhikariyon se mili jaankaree ke mutabik bataaya ki bacchee skool main primary se pard rahi thi
 Recently, the report card was given on the 16th, where the girl had a compartment in the subject of science and social science
 bacchee ne apane ghar me khudakushi kiya he
 The girl was not coming to school since receiving the report card
 ladki ke maa-baap ne aarope lagaaya he ki ladki ke saath chhedchhad kii ghatana hui thi
 Also read: 9th student commits suicide, molesting two teachers, investigation officer suspended Education Minister Manish Sisodia said in the House: - According to the Principal, there are 240 children in the school, out of which 28 have come to the compartment
 akhbaar kii ek report kaa zikr karte hue unhon kaha ki itani choti umr main 11 se 15 saal tak ke bachche sleeping disorder kaa shikaar hai
 Children between 6 and 11 years do not sleep prematurely
 iske peeche academics or gudgates or paariwarik dabaav bhi sabase badi vajah he
 The question is, who is creating academic pressure on children, parent, school or society? Opposition leader Vijendra Gupta said in the House: - The parent has not been given the right answer from the school administration
 bacchee par shaareerik shoshan kii kai ghatnaayen hui
 Pressure was put on the girl who came out as this result
 bacchee fine arts main awwal thi or yahi vajah fail hone kii bataai gai
 He said that there should be an inquiry into what kind of education system is in that school
 jo kuch bhi abhibhavak kah rahe hai uski jaanch kii jaae or 3 din ke bheetar isaki report sadan ke patal main rakhi jaae
 On the demand of Opposition Leader Vijendra Gupta in the Legislative Assembly, Manish Sisodia informed the House that the inquiry has been ordered to the officers in the morning
 saath hi sisodiya ne kaha ki ye ghatnaayen agar hui he to skool prasashan par zarur ection liya jayega

 The case is being investigated by the Cyber crime Police of Bangalore
 maamla is saal farvari kaa he jab karnataka main sattarudh congress kii taraf se ek sidi jari kii gai thi
 This was of a BJP program in which BS Yeddyurappa and Anant Kumar tell each other that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah kept on giving clarification till the elections that he did not give the money to the Congress high command
 isamen donon ke bich ye baatcheet bhi ho rahi he ki unhone bhi party ko rupee die lekin 1000 karod nahin
 The comments darasal yediurppa ne aarope lagaaya tha ki tab kii satta main bane rahane ke liye mukhyamantri siddharmaiya ne 1000 karod rupee party alaakaman ko die or saath hi saath ek diary kaa bhi zikr kiya tha ki wo diary agenciyon ko siddharmaiya ke qareebi emelsi govind raju ke ghar se mili he jisamen in saare len dein kaa zikr he
 The Congress had denied the seizure of any such diary and questioned that if there is any such diary, then what investigation agencies gave Yeddyurappa its information
 maamla tool pakad chukaa tha
 As a part of this, a controversial CD was released by the Congress, in which there is a controversial conversation between Yeddyurappa and Ananth Kumar
 maamla sibar krime police stesan main darj hua or ab court ne donon ko nirdesh die hai ki ek hafte ke andar yediurppa or anant kumaar apni awaz cybar krime police stesan main jaanch adhikari ke saamne record karavaaen taaki iskaa milan sidi main maujuud awaz se karke tay kiya ja sake ki sidi asli he yaa naqli
 In fact, Yeddyurappa had alleged that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah gave 1000 crore rupees to the party high command in order to stay in power and at the same time a diary was mentioned that he would send diary agencies from the house of Siddaramaiah's close MLC Govind Raju Miley in which all these transactions are mentioned
 congress ne aisi kisi bhi diary kii baramadagi se inkaar karte hue sawaal uthaaya tha ki agar aisi koi diary he bhi to uski jaankaree yediurppa ko kya jaanch agenciyon ne di
 The matter had caught up
 isaki kaat ke taur par congress kii taraf se vivadaspad sidi jari kii gai jisamen yedirappa or anant kumaar kii vivaadaaspad baatcheet he
 The case was registered in the cybercrime police station and now the court has instructed both that Yeddyurappa and Ananth Kumar should record their voice in front of the investigating officer at the cyber crime police station within a week to match it with the voice present in the CD
 Whether the CD is real or fake

 India is constantly isolating Pakistan on the grounds of terror
 organijeshan of islamic kooparation (OIC) main bhi bharat ne pakistan ko kootnithik shikast di he
 Pakistan may be happy to tell the world that it has passed a separate resolution on Jammu and Kashmir in the OIC, but Pakistan has not been able to include this proposal in the final joint communiqué to be issued from Abu Dhabi
 bataa den ki sanyukt ghoshnaa patr OIC kaa ekmaatr aadhikarik dastavej he jise is sanghathan ke sabhi 57 desh sweekaar karte hai
 This document is presented to the world for discussion
 pakistan dwaara lagaataar dabaav die jane ke baavjood bhi abu dhabi jhukaa nahin or kashmir ko antim draft main shaamil nahin kiya gaya
 According to information received from trusted sources to India Today, Pakistan has been trying to surround the issues related to India in every session of the OIC
 OIC main pakistan ne pehali baar bharat kaa virodh duusare seshan main kiya, jab raja ali ejaj ke netritv main pakistani pratinidhimandal ne bharat ko nyauta dene ke liye apni kadi aapatti jataai
 Raja Ali Ejaz is the Ambassador of Pakistan to Saudi Arabia
 bataa den ki sushamaa swaraj OIC kii meeting main bataur guest of honor shaamil hui thim
 Opposing this, Pakistan announced on 1 March that it would not attend this meeting
 pehali jeetpakistan ne naa sirf virodh kiya balki isse pehle 27 farvari ko jedda main UAE or saudi arab se baat kar jammu-kashmir par OIC ke contact group kii apaat baithak bhi bulaai
 Pakistan Foreign Secretary Tahmina Janjua and 'president' of Pakistan Occupied Masood Khan were also present in this meeting
 ye donon jammu-kashmir main kathith taur par maanavadhikaar ulanghan ke maamle or bharat main alpsankhyakon par atyachaar ke maamle ko uthaa rahe the or bharat ko nyauta bhejne kaa virodh kar rahe the
 However the OIC did not succumb to this protest
 bharat ke liye ye pehali kootnithik jeet thi
 Secondly, let us tell that India had strongly advocated for the removal of Kashmir from the joint communiqué of the OIC issued from Abu Dhabi
 isi kaa nateeja rahaa ki is ghoshnaptr se kashmir kaa naam alag rahaa, yahaan tak ki is vijyapti main kashmir kii charchaa (passing reference) bhi nahin hui
 This was India's second win at the OIC
 OIC main pakistani pratinidhimandal ne kai deshon ke videsh mantriyon se baat kii, khaskar saudi arab ke videsh mantri se
 Despite all these efforts, Pakistan could only pass a separate resolution on Jammu and Kashmir
 haalanki aise prastaavon kaa zyada kootnithik mahatv nahin he
 One official explained, "these proposals do not show the solidarity of the member states, mainly these proposals show the stand on one issue of one country, many countries present their own proposals, most such proposals are not opposed is
 "bataa den ki OIC ke sanyukt ghoshnaptr ke itihaas main abtak sirf taashkand ghoshnaptr 2016 main hi aisa hua tha ki jab antim document se kashmir shabd kaa hataaya gaya tha

 Video: strong room ke baahar din-raat date hai kaaryakarta, iviem par rakhe hai najar Night life of Mumbai is coming back

 In Mumbai's life, it should be only a few hours of fun, but the whole country sees it with surprise
 or dekhe bhi kyon naa, kyonki aadhe se bhi zyada desh ne raat kii jindagi yaa to dekhi hi nahin yaa phir use dekhne hi nahin diya gaya

 Even suppose that the sun sets and rises in North India a little differently than in the West, yet it is not so different that night life is never seen

 But again and again some voices arise that advocate night light

 If good people ever come out on the road, then threaten them so much that they never come back at night
 goa main aparaadh kuch badhane lage to sabase pehla kaam police ne vahaan par dukaanon ko jaldi band karake kiya
 They think it will create fear that will prevent crime

 There used to be a truly beautiful night in Mumbai
 sadaken jagamagaaya karti thim
 Those who did not get time in the day, they used to go out at night to entertain themselves
 lekin bam dhamaakon or aatanki vaardaaton ke baad puraa shahar dar ke saae main chalaa gaya
 People started going to homes early, bars, dance bars were closed, restaurants, pub shutters started falling, taxis started getting bad at night and slowly Mumbai also started getting scared by late night
 ye dar kaa saaya he jisase ek baar phir mumbai ubarna chaahati he, desh ke duusare hisse ho saktaa he vaisaa naa kar paaen lekin mumbai ko to misaal pesh kerani hi hogi ki use raat se dar nahin lagata

 Sunny Deol's son Karan Deol is going to start his Bollywood career with the film Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas
 jaahir he, pita ke taur par sani deol or dada ke taur par dharmendra kii vajah se ve kaaphi protective maahaul main paley-bade hai
 Karan Deol also accepts his privileges, but recently he has talked about the negative effects of being born in a superstar family
 fasebuk pej hayumons of bombai ke saath ek intervyuu main karan ne bataaya, "skool kii meri pehali yaad pehali class se he
 We used to have a sports competition and i was participating in a race
 main vahaan khadaa tha or kuch badi class ke bacchon ne mujhe gher liya
 "karan told," One picked me up and slammed down in front of everyone
 phir mujhase poocha tu vaaki sani deol kaa betaa he? kyonki tu to fite bhi nahin kar paa rahaa
 i was quite embarrassed at that time
 "karan ne kaha, "lekin iske baad bhi mere liye chijen khaas behatar nahin hui
 Either the children used to judge me or make fun of me and even the teachers were doing the same
 ek baar jab maine apana asinament thik se nahin banaaya to ek teacher ne aakar mujhase kaha tha ki tum sirf apane pita ke check sahi likh sakate ho or kuch nahin
 "view this post on instagramthank You for the feature @officialhumansofbombay ・ ・ ・" The first memory i have of school, was when i was in 1st grade
 We had a sports competition and i was taking part in a race
 i was standing there, when suddenly a few older boys surrounded me
 One of them lifted me up, and in front of everyone, smacked me down
 He then asked me, 'are you sure you're Sunny Deol's son? You can't even fight back '
 i was so embarrassed
 It didn't get any easier from there
 Most kids would either judge me or make fun of me, and even the teachers were the same
 Once when i didn't do well in an assignment, in the middle of the class, a teacher came up to me and said, 'you're only capable of writing your dad's cheques, and nothing else
 ’ My mom was my only support through all of this, she kept telling me, ‘they’re saying these things because that’s how they are as people, it says nothing about you
 'and that kept me going
 It was tough but i had to stand up for myself, and answer back instead of giving up and backing down
 i had to understand that no one else, but i had the right to decide my worth
 i think my turning point was when my school was hosting a talent competition, and i decided to take part
 i realised that this was a chance to prove myself
 i spent night after night, preparing a rap -- because that’s the only thing i knew i was good at
 On the day, i remember walking up on that stage, and there was a sea of people, with all eyes on me
 But i took a deep breath, and performed my heart out
 All the years of being bullied, of being ridiculed, of being identified as nothing else but 'sunny Deol's son', came out when i was up on that stage
 The audience was cheering me on too -- i felt so liberated; like I’d finally broken free from the shackles
 It took time, but that moment changed my life
 i realised that sometimes, it doesn’t take people, and situations, to make your life better
 It takes a strong belief in yourself, the power to see yourself for who you are, and not the way others want you to be
 You’re not made to fit into moulds, you’re made to create your own identity -- one that’s unlike anybody else’s
 "A post shared bykaran Deol (@imkarandeol) onaug 29, 2019 at 10:50 pm PDT Karan said," My mother supported me a lot in the midst of all this
 " wo mujhe kahati thim ki ve aisa isliye bol rahe hai kyonki ve insaan ke taur par aise hi hai
 But they cannot raise any question on your character
 maa kii baat sunakar mujhe himmat milti
 i realized that no one else but myself had to prove myself
 karan ne kaha, "mujhe lagata he ki mere liye terning point aayaa jab mere skool main ek tallent pratiyogita hui or maine usamen bhaag lene kaa faisla kiya
 For this show i spent a lot of time working on my rap
 kyonki main us samay tak keval rap main hi acha tha
 i remember, i had reached the stage and the crowd was present there, but i took a deep breath and started my performance and after a while the audience was also supporting me
 ""us kshan ne meri jindagi badal di thi
 i realized that your life is not because of people or circumstances, but because of having faith in yourself, things get better

 There was an uproar at the famous Sawaiman Singh School in Jaipur at that time
 jab skool kii kareeb chalis mahila teacher pratadna kii shikaayat lekar rajasthan mahila ayog kii daftar pahunch gayi
 Seeing such a large number of complainant teachers, a conference hall was opened to hear complaints
 jaipur ke purv maharaj ke naam par shuru kiye gaye is skool ko jaipur ke purv rajpariwaar ke sadsy chalaate hai
 Most of the women who teach in this school are wives of Rajasthan's IAS, IPS
 mahila ayog pahunchi ye mahila is kadar dukhi thim ki kar rone lageen
 They say that they are being tortured mentally in school
 skool kii principal jaanboojhkar pratadna karti hai magar management kuch nahin karata
 On the complaint of women, the Women's Commission called Vidha Rani, a member of the erstwhile royal family of Jaipur
 magar vidha rani ke vakil mahila ayog ke dafkar pahunche or kaha ki vidha rani kii tabiyat achaanak bighad gai he or wo jaipur ke durlabh ji aspataal main bhartee he
 SMS school lawyer Anirudh Singi, who reached the Women's Commission, said that all the allegations of the teachers are wrong
 inhone jaanboojhkar apane hiton ke liye is tarah ke aarope lagaae hai
 While the chairperson of the Women's Commission, Suman Sharma said that we have 34 teachers who have written complaints
 hamane donon taraf kii baaten suni he or management se inaki shikayaton par dhyaan dene ko kaha he
 It is worth noting that this school is run by the family of Jaisingh, son of Gayatri Devi, the former Maharani of Jaipur
 viviipi helicopter ghotalemen indian airforce ke purv chif espi tyaagi ke saath 12 anya logon ke khilaaf sibiai ne maamla darj kiya he
 Allegations of alleged fraud, corruption and criminal conspiracy have been made in the FIR against Tyagi and others in connection with the Rs 3,600 crore deal
 is maamle main tyaagi ke awaas sahit 14 jagahon par sibiai ne buudhvaar ko chhapemari kii
 SP Tyagi is the first Air Force President against whom an FIR has been lodged by the CBI in corruption or any criminal case
 sibiai sutron ne bataaya ki purv vayusena pramukh, unke chachere bhaaiyon - sanjeev urf juli, rajeev urf doxa or sandip, europea bichauliye kaalre gerosa, chrishchiyan michel or guido heshke un 13 logon main shaamil he jinhen praathmiki main namjad aaropee banaaya gaya he
 After the FIR was lodged, an attempt was made to know the former Air Force chief's side but no response was received
 tyaagi ne apane upar lagaae gaye aaropon ko sire se khaarij kiya thasibiai kaa aarope he ki vayusena pramukh ke taur par apane kaarykaal main tyaagi or ‘unki manjuuri se’ vayusena ne ‘viviipi helicopteron kii udaan kii adhiktam unchai 6,000 meter se ghataakar 4,500 meter karne kii anivaaryta par sahmati di jiskaa suraksha aadhaar evam anya sambhddha kaarnon se joardaar virodh kiya gaya tha
 The investigating agency alleged that the reduction in the maximum flight height of the helicopters allowed Britain's agustawestland to remain in the race for the deal
 yadi helicopteron kii udaan kii adhiktam unchai kam nahin kii gayi hoti to yah company boli main hissaa bhi nahin le paati 
 Sources said the CBI alleges that the middleman Heschke had entered into several consultancy contracts with agustawestland since 2004-2005 through his Tunisia-based company Gordian Services Serl and was more or less on a one-to-one basis with the Tyagi brothers: Tyagi Had cousin contracts with: in anubandhon kii aad main heshke ne tyaagi bandhuon ko kathith taur par 1
 26 million euros and two million euros
 praathmiki main kaha gaya, ‘bheji hui in rakamon ke alaava, tyaagi bandhuon ko bichauliyon (heshke or gerosa) se kuch aparimanit dhan bhi praapt hua
 The amount of time sent to the Tyagi brothers and the reduction in the maximum flight height of the helicopters coincides with the softening of the Indian Air Force's approach
 ’sibiai kii praarambhik jaanch main jo do naam shaamil nahin the unhen bhi praathmiki main namjad aaropee banaaya gaya he
 These include Satish Bagrodia, brother of former Union Minister Santosh Bagrodia and Pratap Agarwal, Chairman cum Managing Director of IDS Infotech
 sibiai sutron ne bataaya ki italvi company finamekenika, agastavestland, mohali kii idies imphotech, chandigarh kii eromatrix, idies tunisia or idies morishas ko bhi praathmiki main namjad kiya gaya he
 Praveen Bakshi, CEO of Aeromatrix, Giuseppe Orsi, former president of Finmeccanica, Bruno Spagnolini, former CEO of agustawestland, and Gautam Khaitan, legal advisor and former board member of IDS Infotech, have also been charged
 sabhi aropiyon ne apane khilaaf lagaae gaye aaropon ko khaarij kiya he
 The CBI alleges that Khaitan, Bagrodia, Aggarwal and Bakshi helped middlemen bring money to India

 The situation has worsened for the poor, the afflicted, the minorities under the rule of the present government
 sarkaar ke kaarykaal main lagaataar hinsaatmak ghatnaon main badhotaree hui he
 The current situation in Jammu and Kashmir shows the failure of the government
 baithak khatm hone ke baad kya bole gulam nabi aaazaad -baithak ke baad congress ke varisht netaa gulam nabi aaazaad ne modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki endie sarkaar sirf tivi main hero dikhti he, balki asal main jiron he
 He said that the issue of Kashmir was discussed during the meeting
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne mahila suraksha par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki yah sarkaar sabakaa saath sabakaa vikaas ke naare ke saath ai thi, balki abhi bhi mahilaayein surakshit nahin he
 This government is a government of slogans, which only looks like a hero on TV, but in reality is zero
 3 saal main vifal rahi sarkaarazad ne kaha ki endie sarkaar ke 3 saal puure ho gaye hai
 No matter how happy this government is or advertise on television for 24 hours, this government has failed
 aaazaad ne kaha ki congress kaarysmiti kii baithak main kashmir ke mudde par charchaa hui he

 " The famous Hollywood actor Leonardo dicaprio has been giving hits continuously for the last several years
 lekin durbhaagya he ki ve auskar puraskaar paane main safal nahin ho pate
 Although he has won the Golden Globe Award several times
 lekin jaraa sochie agar leonardo bharat main hote to kitni baar aword pate
 By the way, it is quite possible that an award ceremony would be started only to award them
 bollywood main puraskaar samarohon kii sankhya ab haath kii anguliyon se paar paa gai he
 Talking about award categories among them, there is such an increase from ceremony to ceremony that even Brahma cannot predict
 nateeja yah ki na to actors or na hi unke prashansak ab in puraskaron ko ahmiyat dete hai
 Alam is that once in Hindi cinema, the actors who had longed to touch the 'black Lady', now do not fail to openly flaunt such celebrations
 har saal ke saath kuch sitare in puraskaron se pallaa jhaadte najar aate hai
 While stars like Aamir Khan and Ajay Devgan have done this feat in the past, Bollywood's 'queen' Kangana Ranot also said that she knows that these are commercial celebrations and they aim to earn trps and money
 yahi nahin, vah inhen jalsa maatr hi maanati hai
 Recently, Akshay Kumar has also openly spoken of lobbying for the awards
 ajab-gajab puraskaron kaa daurhaal hi ek puraskaar samaaroh main best saporting actor category main mjedaar cheez dekhne ko mili
 Nawazuddin Siddiqui was also in this Katagiri, who was nominated for 'badlapur'
 haalanki 'barajrangi bhaijan' main bhi unki acting kamaal thi, lekin aan-baan or shaan ke saath puraskaar mila anil kapur (dil dhadkane do) ko
 a film that was mediocre at the box office and could not find a place among the audience
 khayr, chaliye jo jeuri kii marji
 Singer is popular, but in the 'sur' of the award, Khamisang has been the hallmark of Hindi cinema
 is saal kii sabase badi flop filmon main shumaar 'roy' ke sangeet ko har film samaaroh me saraahaa ja rahaa he
 Perhaps its reason may also be its music company, because the bigger the name, the bigger the prize
 yahi nahin, sabhi ko santusht karne ke liye best mujeec diarector se lekar best mujeec album jaisikatagori bhi bana di gaihain
 Alam this is the award for Best Singer, but the song for which is available has disappeared long before the playlist of the people
 aao or paao kii kavayadpuraskaron kaa majaa yah he ki agar aapako lage ki koi santusht nahin ho rahaa he to uske liye nai katagori bana dijie
 As often happens
 alag-alag actors ko ab popular chwwis se lekar, best actor, critic chwwis tak har aword de diya jaataa he
 Still, if there is any cancer or someone is angry, then apart from fitness, other award options are also sought
 actor na sahi to kai baar uski filmon ko pramotion campan ke liye bhi puraskaar se nawaja ja chukaa he
 And if this does not matter, then it is 'entertainment of the Year' or 'power Packed Performance of the Year'
 kursi or camere par rakhie najaravaise bhi yah puraskaar kaaphi obvious hote ja rahe hai
 You need a little sarcasm
 parkhi najar yun ki jab camera jalse main maujuud logon par daalaa jaae to aap dekhie koun-koun aayaa he
 How much he has come prepared
 kahaan bithaaya gaya he
 Just understand who is the winner
 is baar bhi ekpuraskaar samarohame aisa hi hua
 It was guessing after seeing the stars
 najar saamne pariniti chopra par padi
 She was sitting in a posing pose
 laga parformens deni hogi
 But what, he was made the 'style Icon of the Year' without leaving a mark on the big screen
 ab ise aword kahen, kismat kahen yaa phir kuch or marji aapaki he
 TRP games do not come live like the awards ceremony of the Oscars
 inaki recording hi dikhaai jaati he
 The reason is that thick sponsors are found for TV and they are brought on primetime
 jisase tiarapy main to oochaal aata hi he, kamai bhi hoti he
 Now when so much is at stake, steps are made to be blown up
 darshakon kii ankhon ko sukh mili, isliye diggaj superstar dhunde jate hai taaki ve stage par parformens de saken
 The same performance is shown during promos associated with award ceremonies
 logon ko khub lubhaaya jaataa he taaki tiarapy acchhee ho sake
 In such a situation, if it started a couple of categories to make some stars happy, what difference does it make
 bas isi vajah se yah aword samaaroh apana mahatv khote ja rahe hai or antertenment sambadhi program main tabdeel hote ja rahe hai
 Why do not copycats be made here? Bollywood who copy Hollywood on every step, apart from films and ideas, should also learn to organize award ceremony
 hindi cinema ke liye shaayad yah sanbhalane kaa daur he ki vah apni garima ko banaae rakhe, kyonki sab kuch antertenment-antertenment or antertenment hi nahin hota
 And if the so-called seekers of Indian cinema are so careless then the day is not far when Gambhir stars will be missing from the award ceremonies

 These three suspects also pointed out that they were also involved in the Sealdah Ajmer Express train accident on December 28

 This time the Lok Sabha election in Rajasthan is very interesting
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi ne is rajya main sabhi siten jitkar congress kaa safaya kar diya tha
 But in the subsequent elections, there was a tremendous decline in bjp's vote percentage
 ajmer or alvar main hue loksabhaa upachunaav main bijepi kii haar hui uske baad vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi harkar satta se baahar ho gai
 However, in this election, exit and opinion polls hinted at a major defeat for the BJP
 lekin aisa nahin hua bijepi ne 75 siten jeet leen
 At the same time, the Congress was also able to touch the majority figure
 is chunaav main ek naaraa bhi suna gaya, 'vasundhara teri khayr nahin, modi se bair nahin' jiskaa sanket tha ki janata piem modi se nahin siem vasundhara raaje se naaraaz he
 There is no doubt that the leaders of the party organization were also angry with Vasundhara Raje's arbitrariness and many leaders were angry because of Vasundhara Raje in distributing tickets
 vasundhara se naaraaz hokar bijepi ke kaddavar netaa jaswant singh ke bete maanavendra singh jo ki vidhayak the vah bhi congress main shaamil ho gaye the
 At the same time, Vasundhara failed to handle issues like Padmavat controversy, Gurjar agitation
 rajasthan main meena samudaay se hameshaa se hi congress ke saath detaa rahaa he
 But due to leaders like Kironi Lal Meena, he was also tilted in favor of BJP
 kironi laal midaa ne bhi vasundhara se naaraaz hokar alag party bana lee thi
 At the moment, Kirori Lal is now back with the BJP
 vahiin bijepi ke liye acchhee baat yah he ki gurjar andolan ke netaa karnal bansla bhi party main shaamil ho gaye hai
 Let's talk about the Rajasthan Lok Sabha seat of Jaipur Lok Sabha, the last time the BJP won a tremendous victory here

 isse pehle 19871 main gayatri devi ne teesri baar yahaan jeet darj kii thi
 The BJP has also fielded sitting MP Ramcharan Bohra this time
 saal 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main ramacharan bohara ne congress ke mahesh joshi ko 5
 Won a big win by defeating 40 lakh votes
 baat karen jyoti khandelwal ko to vah yahaan ki meyar rah chuki hai
 Polling for this seat will be held on May 6 and results will be out on May 23

 Pakistan's Information Broadcasting Department Minister Fawad Chaudhary has said that Islamabad is keen to have a fresh dialogue with New Delhi after the end of the election process in India
 kyonki bharat main aamchunaavon ke maddenjar maujuuda raajnneetik uthal-puthal ke bich baatcheet kaa sahi samay nahin he
 The statement came from Islamabad when a three-member Pakistani delegation from India came to India regarding the Indus river agreement
 pakistan sarkaar main mantri fawaad choudhary ne kaha, 'bhartiya raajnneeti main chal rahi uthal-puthal ke bich yah baatcheet kaa sahi samay nahin he
 We have deferred efforts to negotiate with India because we do not expect any major decisions from the current Indian leadership
 ' unhone kaha ki jab tak kuch sthirataa na ho, bharat se baat karnaa vyarth he

 isse pehle pakistan yah kahata rahaa he ki uski taraf se baatcheet ko lekar kii gai kai pahal par nai dilli kii taraf se koi saakaratmak jawaab nahin aayaa
 However, on behalf of India, it has always been reiterated that until Islamabad stops promoting terrorism, no concrete dialogue between the two countries is possible

 sarkaar chayan ke maamle main janata kii pasand alag hoti he
 This is the reason why these companies do not understand the complexity of Indian society and fail to understand the BSP voters and its voting pattern
 pehle to sabhi companiyaan chota namoona leti he, jo sahi pratinidhitiv nahin darshata, lihaaja usase pramanik nishkarsh nahin nikalate
 Secondly, these companies do not have trained and people who understand the tendencies of the voters
 jabaki ek prabhavi namoona lene or vishleshan ke liye basapa ke un votaron-samarthakon ke bare main samajhnaa jaruri he, jo nirakshar, khamosh or malin bastiyon main rahete hai
 There is a need to make better contact with such respondents before collecting data

 Thirdly, the surveyors do not have any method to gauge the reaction of the silent voters of the BSP who remain silent, especially in rural areas for fear of their opponents
 chauthi baat, survey karne vaale praayah jatiyon ke vargeekaran or unki pasand-naapsand se bilkul anjaan hote hai
 For example, there are 66 scheduled castes, 79 backward castes in UP and a dozen castes among Muslims
 jabaki anya main teen varna brahman, rajput or vaisya main bhi kai jatiyaan he
 The biggest challenge is to sample among these castes
 aisa namoona lene kii visheshgyata aakhir kiske paas he?survey karne vaale zyada se zyada shahari, mukhar or raay vyakt karne ke liye sahajata se uplabdh hone vaale teen varnon par hi jor dete hai
 Because of these biases, those mistakes are not added to the election forecast and exit poll findings

 is

 Despite the responsibility of cleaning the MCD, the Delhi government tried to work together
 hajaaron trek kooda hamane hataaya jo ki hamaara kaam nahin tha
 But there was no support from MCD

 The people of BJP are deliberately spreading dirt, so i will plead with the Prime Minister that Delhi is the capital of the country and politicians from all over the country come to Delhi
 dilli desh kaa aaina he, puure desh kii safai ho na ho, dilli kii safai to kara hi den
 The Prime Minister must call the MCD once a month
 'bijepi nahin karne de rahi kaam'satyendra jain har baar ye daawa karte hai ki safai karnaa dilli sarkaar kaa kaam nahin he
 He said that everyone's work is fixed
 emsidi main 80 hajaar karmchaariyon kii jimmedaari he safai karnaa
 Apart from this, garbage has been given to the contract for more than thousand crore rupees
 agar wo thekedaar kooda nahin uthaa rahaa he to emsidi use rupee kyon de rahi he? emsidi vaale netaa giri kar rahe hai
 Officers and employees work, but the BJP does not allow them to work
 baaki parshad sirf paise ikatthe karte rahete hai or koi kaam nahin karte
 He further said that if the MCD hands over a part of its cleaning fund to the Delhi government, then the government is ready to take over the responsibility of cleaning the entire Delhi
