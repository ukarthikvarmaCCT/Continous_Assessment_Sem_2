 Now JDU has targeted the Grand Alliance

 He said that the leaders of the Mahagathbandhan constituent would not only have to go to jail to discuss the jailed RJD president Lalu Prasad Yadav ji but would have to get an agreement to give them their land or property
 'niraj kumaar ne enditivi se baat karte hue kaha ki lalu prasad ji ghatak dal ke pramukh dal rajd ke adhyaksh hai or inke raajnneetik jivan kaa itihaas rahaa he ki jab ve rail mantri the tab bhi unhone hotel theka dene ke liye patna main jameen liya tha
 Not only this, land was also written to poor people in the name of providing jobs in railways
 jadyu netaa ne aage kaha ki saansad or vidhayak ke liye tikat dene ke liye bhi jameen likhavane kaa unka itihaas rahaa he
 In such an election, the ticket holders and the leaders of the constituents involved in the grand alliance will also have to prepare an agreement for land and property and meet them

 After the first bi-monthly monetary policy review meeting of the current financial year, the Reserve Bank said that during 2019-20, inflation is going to be affected by many factors
 sabase pehle janvari-farvari ke dauraan naram khaadya mudrasphiti kaa nikat bhavishya ke mudrasphiti ke paridrishy par asar padegaa
 Along with this, the impact of falling inflation in the fuel group has been seen during the February policy meeting
 kendriya bank ne kaha, ‘in karkon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue tathaa 2019 main monsoon saamaanya rahane ke kaaran upabhokta mulya suchakank aadhaarit mudrasphiti kaa purvanumaan ghataakar vitt varsh 2018-19 kii chauthi timahi ke liye 2

 The Reserve Bank said that in February, excluding food and fuel, consumer price index-based inflation was below expectations, which suggested a way to reduce the headline inflation forecast
 savarna aarakshan, ye saamaanya varg kaa aarakshan he
 We are opposing the way it is implemented
 bina kisi jaanch, ayog, survey or surveykshan ke inhone maatr kuch ghanton main samvidhan main sanshodhan kar diya
 We are in favor of the poor upper castes
 jaldbaaji main lagu kiye gaye is aarakshan kaa hashr notebandi jaisaa hi hoga
 Look at our uncle
 nitish kumaar ne uchhal kar jaldbaaji main swarna aarakshan ko samarthan dene kaa faisla kar liya
 Now the rjd's stand is backing shyly
 thode din baad khulkar hamaari maang kaa bhi samarthan karenge kyonki janata maalik hoti he
 She will force them
 ham itane din se maang kar rahe the, hamaara ceiling nahin badhaayaa lekin yahaan bin maange unhen de diya
 Because they are not afraid of your vote
 ham is aarakshan kii paddati par sawaal uthaa rahe hai
 Explain how the poor who earn 8 lakhs per annum, ie, Rs 66,666 a month, became poor? Is the strange math of the central government brother? If you earn 8 lakhs annually, then you have to pay 20% tax
 matlab 8 lakh salanaa kamaane par aapako 72,500 ru salanaa tex dena pad rahaa he or modi ji kehete hai wo garib hai
 Tell the person who pays 72,500 rupees to the government, the government is giving him reservation
 modi ji kehete hai jiske paas 5 acre zamin he, yani 160 kattha yani 8 bigha zamin, wo bhi garib he
 And they should get reservation on economic basis
 bataaiye
 
 
 The opponents of reservation used to shout merit-merit earlier, now they are very happy
 unki doharaapanthi nahin chalegi
 Either you believe that you are a casteist, hence the capable, capable and talented Dalits are engaged in cutting backward and cannot represent them
 yaa phir ye maniye kii wo aarakshan ke sabase bade adhikari hai
 You will also claim the rights of others and in the varna system you will consider yourself superior to others
 dusron kaa saamaajik tiraskaar bhi karenge
 They will also make fun of their caste
 shoshan karenge lekin samanta kaa adhikaar nahin denge
 Neither will their caste be counted nor will they be allowed to happen
 or apni jati bhi nahin ginenge kyonki aapaki pole khul jaaegi ki kaise mutthi bhar logon ne desh ke sabhi kshetron or sansadhano par jaateey baahubal or thagi ke dam par qabza jamaa rakhaa he
 In 1978, Mandal commissioned to give 27% reservation to 52% OBC of the country
 report ai 1980 main
 Implementation was announced in 1990
 lagu hua 1993 main
 It was also introduced in higher education institutions in 2008
 kitna andolan hua, kitne khun bahe, kitne log laathiyaan khaae, in sabaki kalpana kii hi nahin ja sakati
 Even now the OBC reservation has not been fully implemented
 15% swarnon ko 10% aarakshan dene ke liye koi kamishan nahin bana or 72 ghante main aarakshan de diya gaya
 According to the old census SC / ST in the country, the ratio of population to 22
 5% samaan aarakshan mila tha lekin aaj daliton kii bhi aabaadi badi he, isliye SC / ST kaa bhi aarakshan badhanaa chahie
 We strongly proclaim this fight by demanding it
 1931 kii janaganana ke mutabik, pichhadon kii aabaadi 52% thi
 But the backward got only 27% reservation in 1993, 46 years after independence
 ucch shiksha main 2008 main matlab 61 saal baad aarakshan mila wo bhi modi ji kii manuaadi sarkaar ne do din pehle samaapt kar diya
 Our demand is that the backward should get reservation at least 52% according to the backward population (52%) of 1931, at least 88 years ago
 or phir jaateey janaganana ke baad use jaateey anupaat main badhaayaa jaae
 Our demand is that 40% reservation should be provided to the backward classes
 ham aaj ek nae andolan kii ghoshnaa karte hai 'berogari hataao, aarakshan badhaao'
 
 
 'get the ethnic census done and increase the reservation in ethnic proportions
 desh main SC / ST or OBC kaa aarakshan badhaakar 90% karo
 Implement reservation in private sector '
 
 
 kis aadhaar par ye log jatigat aarakshan ko badal kar aarthik aarakshan main tabdeel kar rahe hai? kis report, ayog or surveykshan ke aadhaar par? agar aaj ham or aap samvidhan ke saath chhedchhad kaa virodh nahin karenge to baba sahab or aane vaali peediyaan hamen maaf nahin karengi!agar aapkaa saansad pichhadaa or dalit he to use apane kshetra main mat ghusane do, kyonki unhone aapke or bahujanon kaa aarakshan badhaane kii maang nahin kii
 Such cowardly and timid people do not deserve to become your MP
 agar wo aapke hakon ke liye apni party main aawaaj hi nahin uthaa sakate to aise saansadon ko dhikkaar he
 All the Dalit-backward mps in the country should be boycotted
 unhen kshetra main ghusane nahin diya jaae
 They should be questioned

 officiala post shared by Sunny Leone (@sunnyleone) on Aug 15, 2017 at 6:07am PDT Pakistan on Monday termed the Indian Army's new doctrine as "absurd" and "irresponsible", which encompasses scenarios of fighting a war on two fronts with China and Pakistan
 pakistan ke videsh mantri shah mahmud kuraishi ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha ‘‘main ise betuka kahuunga or bahut hi gaiyr jimmedaarana
 When i read about this in the media, i was taken aback
 ’’ kuraishi kii yah tippanee bhartiya sena ke adhikariyon kii un tippaniyon ke maddenjar ai he jinamein kaha gaya he ki nae siddhant main ab china or pakistan ke saath ekasaath do morche par yuddh ladane ke paridrishyon ko shaamil karne kii baat kahi gai he
 It is noteworthy that the Indian Army reviews its doctrine every five years in its training command at Shimla
 pakistani sena ke pramukh general ashfak parvej kayaani bhi pichley hafte kah chuke hai ki unka bal kisi bhi aakraamak manshaa yaa ‘‘cold start doctrin’’ ko haraane main sakasham he
 Without making any mention, Qureshi said that Pakistan is not under any pressure and "will not accept pressure"
 ’’unhone kaha ‘‘ham kshetra main shanti chaahate hai or ham sthiti ko saamaanya karnaa chaahate hai
 We want to start the composite dialogue
 ’’ kuraishi ne kaha ki pakistan apane sabhi padosiyon ke saath achche sambandh chahta he
 Qureshi claimed that the disrupted relations between India and Pakistan are also having an impact on the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
 unhone kaha ‘‘jab bharat or pakistan ke bich sambandh sudharte hai to saarc par iskaa acha asar padataa he
 When negotiations between the two countries get postponed, it has an impact on SAARC
 ’’ kuraishi ne kaha ‘‘hamen dekhnaa he ki chizon ko koun uthaa rahaa he? pakistan dakshes ko majboot karnaa chahta he or ise upyogi forum bananaa chahta he
 He recently termed the release of each other's fishermen by the two countries as a positive development and said that Pakistan also demanded a revival of the judicial committee on prisoners

 co / vraceqij50 The bjp's mother organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has now given a new theory
 aresas ne kaha he ki madhyakaal main mughalon ke bharat aane kii vajah se desh main dalit, adivasee or duusare haashie ke tabakon kaa janm hua
 This has been claimed by senior RSS leaders in three books written by BJP spokesperson Vijay Sonkar Shastri
 ye kitaaben hai, 'hindu charmkaar jati, hindu khatic jati or hindu valmiki jati
 'recently these books were released by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat
 'aakrantaon ne ghinaune kaam karne ko majaboor kiya'in kitabon kii prastaavna aresas ke varisht netaaon suresh soni, krishna gopal or suresh 'bhaiyaji' joshi ne likhi he
 Bhaiyyaji Joshi writes, 'according to Hindu texts the Shudras were never untouchables
 madhyakaal main islamic atyaachaar ke baad hi achhut, dalit or bhartiya musalmaan jaise tabake ban gaye
 He writes, "the foreign invaders forced them (hindus) to do disgusting things to hurt the Hindu self-respect of the Chandravanshi Kshatriyas
 ve gauhatya karne lage
 They would remove the skin of the cow and throw its dead body on desolate places
 is tarah videshi aakrantaon ne hinduon ko sajaa ke taur par yah kaam dekar charm-karm karne vaali jati ko janm diya
 "RSS claims Mughal era is the origin of Dalits" Another senior RSS leader Suresh Soni writes, "dalits have their origins in Turks and Mughal times
 aaj jo valmiki, sudarshan, majahabi sikh or unke 624 upjatiyaan hai, ve brahmanon or kshatriyon par kiye gaye atyaachaar kii vajah se paidaa hui hai
 'the third RSS leader Krishna Gopal writes,' In the Vedic period the Khatik caste was counted among the Brahmins
 yah bhi dhyaan dene vaali baat he ki muslim aakrantaon ke aane se pehle bharat main suar paale jane kaa koi sandarbh nahin miltaa he
 The Hindus adopted this occupation, forcing them to defend themselves
 'sabko hindu kii chhatari tale laane kii koshish?gauratlab he ki hinduvadi sanghathan aresas bhartiya itihaas ko nae sire se likhe jane ko badhaava detaa rahaa he, saath hi, peshewaron ke likhe itihaas ko hindu virdohi bataakar khaarij karata rahaa he
 After the bjp's victory in the Lok Sabha elections, the RSS has started writing the history of India based on the Puranas
 aresas par yah bhi aarope lagata rahaa he ki bijepi sarkaar vaale pradeshon main vah skool or uniwarsity ke paathyakramon ko apane agenda se prabhavit karne kii koshish karata he
 Experts believe that in the Lok Sabha elections, BJP also got the votes of Dalits and backward
 ek theory yah bhi he ki bijepi or aresas chaahate hai ki daliton or pichhadon ko hindu vot bank se alag na hone diya jaae

 Shimla said that she was also thrown down from the roof
 pati dahej chahta tha magar mata-pita kii haisiyat uski maang puri karne kii nahin thi
 She had a son and daughter, in front of her husband's torture, she started feeling lost and thought of taking steps like suicide, but the face of the children would come in front of her
 shimla bataati he ki ek din der raat usne apane bete-beti ke saath ghar chhod diya, or ek railgadee main baithkar banda ke liye chal padi
 He did not have the money to cut one day, but on reaching Banda, he got the support of acquaintances that the spirit of fighting arose in him

 Shimla says that her family is doing well today
 bacchon kaa jivan sanvar jaae, yahi ummid lekar vah chal rahi he
 She does not regret that she has received scorn and harassment from her husband, but complacency is that she is also coming to the work of the people of the society who need someone's support to get employment

 - input IANS The Samajwadi Party's support base and Mulayam's political future are going through a difficult phase since the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections
 baavjood iske shivpal yadav or akhilesh yadav ke bich shah-maat kaa khel jari he
 It is said that if looting and rioting starts in the sinking ship, it sinks more quickly
 samaajawaadee party kii sthiti kamobesh yahi he
 The war that broke out in Mulayam Singh's courtyard before the assembly elections is still going on
 jabaki chachaa bhattije kii kadavaahat ke chalate hi espi ko upi kii satta ganvaani padi he
 Even after this, Shivpal and Akhilesh do not miss the chance to beat each other
 mulaayam singh yadav ne guuruuvaar ko lohia trust kii baithak bulaai, jismensapa ke adhyaksh akhilesh yadav,ramgopal yadav, ajam khan, dharmendra yadav or balram yadav shaamil nahin hue
 Akhilesh faction boycotted this meeting of Mulayam
 isse saaf he ki mulaayam kunbe main baghawat kii chingaari sulag rahi he
 On the pretext of Lohia Trust, Shivpal is trying to strengthen his political ground
 raajnneetik galiyaaron main mana ja rahaa he ki is baithak ke bahaane mulaayam singh yadav koi siyaasi kadam uthaa sakate hai
 This is the reason that all eyes are on this meeting
 vidhansabha chunaav se pehle akhilesh ne chachaa ramgopal yadav ke saath milakar shivpal ko thikaane lagaaya
 Not only this, he also took command of the party in his own hands
 iske baad se shivpal mulaayam ke sahare akhilesh ko raajnneetik maat dene kii kavayad kar rahe hai, lekin abhi tak unka sapana saakaar nahin ho sakaa he
 Akhilesh has shown the way to the people from the organization after the election
 party ab puri tarah se akhileshmay he
 Shivpal has been continuously targeting Akhilesh with the help of Mulayam, but so far he has not been successful
 vidhansabha chunaav main haar ke baad se hi saarvajanik rup se shivpal kehete rahe hai, ki party kii kaman mulaayam singh yadav ko deni chahie, lekin akhilesh ne saaf kah diya he ki wo party ke adhyaksh hai or rahenge
 Nobody will give the command of the party
 akhilesh par dabaav banane ke liye unhone alag party banane kaa raag bhi alapa
 But there was no change in Akhilesh's intention
 iske baad khabar ai kii shivpal bijepi main ja sakate hai
 Akhilesh remained silent on this too
 shivpal mulaayam ke sahare apni siyaasi bisaat lagaataar bicha rahe hai
 Shivpal hopes that with the help of Mulayam, he will overcome his political mile
 isiilie vakt be vakt kehete rahete hai ki samaajwaadiyon ko wo ekajute karke secular morcha banaaenge, jiske adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav honge
 Samaj Mulayam Singh Yadav, the CPB of the Shivpal group, took a big decision in the meeting held at the Lohia Trust office recently
 Four members of Akhilesh were evicted from the trust
 netaji dwaara hataae gaye sadasyon main ram govind choudhary, usha verma, ashok shakya or ahamed hasan shaamil the
 All these members are close to Akhilesh Yadav
 sapa sangrakshak mulaayam singh ne in chaar sadasyon kii jagah shivpal ke chaar karibiyon ko sadsy banaaya
 These include Deepak Mishra, Ram Naresh Yadav, Ram Sevak Yadav and Rajesh Yadav
 lohia trust kii baithak main sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav or ramgopal yadav shaamil nahin hue
 After the meeting, Shivpal Yadav said that for the time being the trust will remain the same which will work in Lohia's interest
 baithak main akhilesh or ramgopal ke shaamil na hone par shivpal ne kaha ki baithak kii soochna sabko di gai thi, ho saktaa he koi kaam pad gaya ho
 At the same time, Shivpal Yadav rejected the ongoing discussion of making Akhilesh Yadav the head of the trust
 shivpal yadav ne kaha ki trust ke adhyaksh netaji hai or vahi rahenge
 We are trying to strengthen and unify the party

 can see on - input bhashaa The strike of jewelers in Gujarat is now 30 days old
 itane dinon tak johariyon kii dukaane pehle kabhi bhi band nahin raheen
 Jewelers are leaving shops and doing different programs, including a bike rally, sometimes a silent rally on the streets every day
 virodh ho rahaa he sone-chaandi ke gahanon par ek pratishat exise duty kaa
 There have been talks with the government, but the result is not coming out
 sarkaar kuch praavdhaanon par sudhaar ke liye taiyaar he, lekin excise duty waapas lene ko taiyaar nahin
 a hypower committee has been formed which will report in 60 days, but the jeweler is not satisfied with this
 lihaaja, unki hadtaal jari he
 It is important that thousands of crores of rupees are being lost daily by this strike
 ek anumaan ke anusaar, desh main rojaanaa paanch se 6,000 karod rupee kaa sone kaa kaarobaar hota he
 So far, the loss of trade across the country has crossed one lakh crore, but there is no way to find a solution
 sarkaar ko lagata he ki sone main duty badhaakar is kshetra main kaale dhan ko kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Government estimates are that most people buy gold and silver from their black money
 excise duty se jahaan harek str par paison kaa hisaab lagaaya ja sakegaa or sarkaar ko aay bhi hogi
 The comments jabaki johariyon ko lagata he isse bhrashtachar badhegaa hi
 He says that even before the intervention of government departments was more in gold, corruption was at its peak
 sarkaar apni manyata kii vajah se unke vyapaar ko baari nuksaan kar rahi he
 This excise duty will make gold more expensive for people, their business will suffer and the government department will have to pay money for corruption, because gold becomes a jewel, from cleanliness, purity, quality to artisans and sales
 Work is done from the level
 itane sabhi staron par excise ke kaagazat karnaa sambhav nahin, lihaaza bachane ke liye sarkari adhikariyon ko paise khilaane padenge
 Both sides are adamant on getting their point
 lekin is hadtaal main gahanon ko banane vaale karigar pis rahe hai, kyonki unki mazdooree maari ja rahi he
 At present, the jewelers have decided to pay them, but they are facing lot of problems due to lack of work

 Where excise duty can be calculated at every level of money and the government will also get income
 tippaniyan While jewelers feel that corruption will only increase
 unka kahana he ki pehle bhi jab sone main sarkari vibhaagon kaa dakhal zyada tha tab bhrashtachar apane charam par tha
 The government is doing huge damage to their business because of their recognition
 is excise duty se logon ke liye sona or mahangaa ho jayega, unke vyapaar par nuksaan hoga auki sarkari vibhaag ko bhrashtachar ke liye paise dene padenge wo alag, kyonki ek gahanaa banane main sone kii safai, shuddhta, quality se lekar karigar auki bikri tak kai str se kaam hota he
 It is not possible to document excise at all levels, so government officials will have to feed money to escape
 donon hi paksh apni baat manwaane par ade hue hai

 vinay katiyaar ne kaha he ki agar masjid par daawa barkaraar rahaa to saadhe chah hajaar duusare vivaadit masjidon par ham daawa karenge
 He also said that there was nothing left of Babri Masjid
 unhone ovaisi se sawaal poochhate hue kaha ki vah yah bataaen ki masjid kahaan banaaenge,ayodhyaamein to ramalala virajman hai or vahiin ram kaa mandir he ab usamen keval bhavyata or divyata denge
 Soon there will be a grand and divine Ram temple built there
 katiyaar ne kaha ki babar kii majaar jab afghanistan main pakki nahin to hindustan main kya banegi
 According to the claim, Babri Masjid is not in the paper, there is nothing of Babar's name
 chhodane ke naam par kuch bachaa to he nahin ab keval itnaa he ki bhagwaan ram taat ke mandir main hai or ab use bhavy mandir bananaa he
 If he moves away from Ayodhya, then we will think of the rest of the temples that we leave
 hamane hameshaa kaha he ki hamen teen sthaan chahie ayodhya, kaashi or mathura
 Our temples already exist in Kashi and Mathura but there was no such structure in Ayodhya
 pehle ayodhya mandir par daawa chhoden phir ham sochenge ki kaashi- mathura kaa kya karnaa he
 Please tell that Owaisi said that the Supreme Court will give its verdict based on the evidence and not the faith, and the Babri Masjid will be built in Ayodhya
 unhone kaha tha ki babari masjid hamaari thi or rahegi, supreme court kaa faisla hamaare paksh main aane ke baad ham vahaan par masjid banaaenge

 This disclosure is in Swami Aseemanand's 'confession' statement, which was recorded under section 164 of crpc

 The NIA later also claimed that Yoshi's phone number was found in a diary from his pocket after Joshi was killed in December 2007 in Dewas, Madhya Pradesh
 khabar ke mutabik, aseemanand ke sahyogi rateshwar ne pehle enie or phir jaj ke saamne die ikbaalia bayaan main kaha tha ki march 2006 main aseemanand ne usase sunil joshi urf manoj ke saath jane ko kaha tha
 Rateshwar had said in his statement, 'manoj told me on the phone that Swami Aseemanand had asked him to go to Jharkhand, Agra, Gorakhpur and Nagpur for some specific work and i should also accompany him
 maine phir aseemanand ji se bhi iske liye poocha

 haalanki yogi ne isamen koi dilchaspee na dikhaate hue unhen vahaan se taraka diya
 According to the statement of Asimanand, filed before the magistrate under section 164 of the crpc, the two did not get time to meet Yogi alone on that day
 iske mutabik, yogi ne baatcheet main koi dilchaspee nahin dikhaai or kisi duusare din aane kaha
 Yogi said, 'I am busy

 After this, Joshi and Rateshwar left Gorakhpur and did not try to meet Yogi again
 vahiin, aseemanand ke 'ikbaalia' bayaan ke mutabik, unhen sunil joshi ne june 2006 main bataaya tha ki use yogi yaa rajeshwar se koi madad nahin mili
 However, Aseemanand later overturned his statement and claimed that he had said this under some pressure

 mritak chaatr ke pita kerri singh yadav ne bataaya ki jab wo maukey par gaye to dekha vahaan kaaphi dur tak nishaan padaa he, aisa lagata he ki kaaphi berahami se maaraa gaya he uske saath chhina-jhapati kii koshish ke dauraan ye sab hua he
 The most shocking thing is that the place where the miscreants stabbed Shivakant in the morning, there was no one to identify the miscreants
 lekin kuch hi duuri par police thana jarur he, philhal police ne shav ko postmortem karaane ke baad mritak student ke parijanon ko saunp diya he or maamle kii tafatish main juty he
 We must have heard the story of many people who inspire us to live life till date
 lekin yahaan ham aapako ek aise shaks kii kahani sunaane ja rahe hai jinhone divyang hone ke baavjood ek misaal kaayam kii or aaj wo hamaare saath-saath khud ke liye bhi ek prerana hai
 Yes, this is the story of Geeta s Rao who has set an example for physically challenged people which will give them an inspiration to live life again
 mahaj teen saal kii umr main gita polio kaa shikaar ho gai thim or tab se vah kabhi chal nahin pain
 His parents used to take him to school
 lekin gita ne jindagi kii jang ladate hue 115 kilometre kii cycle res jiti
 Let us tell you the complete story of Geeta
 
 
 jab gita 3 saal kii thim us dauraan unhen ek baar tej bukhaar chadha
 His parents took him to the hospital where the doctor injected him
 ghar lautne ke baad gita kuch ghante soyi
 She was unable to get up when she woke up
 tabhi pataa chalaa ki polio kaa infections unke puure sharir main fail chukaa he or ab vah na kabhi khadi ho paaengi, na chal paaengi
 Geeta was so sad to see her parents in trouble due to her that she even tried to commit suicide once
 lekin baad main unhone faisla kiya ki ab wo dusron par nirbhar nahin rahengi
 With this decision, he started daily exercise and physiotherapy
 mahaj ek se dedh saal ke bheetar hi unki ye mehnat kaam ai kyonki ab gita khadi bhi ho sakati thim or baisakhi ke sahare chal bhi sakati thim
 Not only this, Geethemistry has also done PGDM course in BSE and Human Resource and Corporate Communication
 khaas baat ye he ki vah iti ejeeniyar ke taur par ek company main kaam bhi kar chuki hai lekin unka sapana tha puri duniya ghoomane kaa, jiske chalate unhone naukari chhod di
 He then started a hotel business with his brother
 bataa den ki gita kaa baayan pair abhi bhi kaam nahin karata lekin kuch hi maheenon pehle unke parivaar ne unhen ek cycle gift kii jiske baad unhone ise chalaanaa shuru kar diya
 Recently Geeta participated in 115 km race, which is a tough race even for ordinary people
 gita na sirf res kaa hissaa bani balki iske liye unhone special prise bhi jeeta
 Now Alam is such that Geeta cycling 50-70 km every other day
 sirf cycling hi nahin, gita banji jumpig bhi karti hai
 It would not be wrong to say that people like Geeta are the pride of the country
 suicidaki koshish se lekar cycle res tak kii kahani vaaki har us shaks ke liye ek misaal he jo jindagi main aa rahi pareshaaniyon ko jindagi kaa ant maan lete hai

 kisi bhi dal ko janata ne purna bahumat nahin diya he, jiske baad maamla puri taraf funs gaya he
 On one side, the Congress, which has lost power, has claimed to form the government by helping the regional party JDS
 to vahiin sabase zyada seat jeetne vaali bijepi rajyapal se sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kar chuki he
 In such a situation, the ball is now in the court of the Governor and it is for them to decide which party should be called to form the government
 is pashopesh kii sthiti main rajyapal ke paas paanch vikalp hone kii charchaa kii ja rahi he, jinke aadhaar par wo faisla le sakate hai
 Here are the five options - First option: The governor has a chance to consider that coalition parties formed before the elections are called for the government
 lekin karnataka main aisa nahin he or congress va jedies ne nattejey aane ke baad gathbandhan main sarkaar banane kaa faisla kiya he
 Therefore, the Governor does not appear to be in a position to call both the parties on this basis
 doosraa vikalp:nateezon ke baad jo party sabase zyada seat praapt karti he, vah rajyapal se sarkaar banane kaa daawa karti he, jiske baad rajyapal us par vichaar karte hai or paryaapt number hone kii sthiti main bade dal ko sarkaar banane ke liye aamantrit karte hai
 Third option: Governors can also call the post-election coalition to form the government
 agar nateezon ke baad kuch partiyon kaa gathbandhan ho jaae or vah sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh kare to rajyapal unhen bhi sarkaar gathan ke liye aamantrit kar sakate hai
 This is the equation in Karnataka right now
 chauthaa vikalp:agar chunaav ke baad gathbandhan karne vaale dal kisi or dal yaa nirdaleey vidhayakon ke bahari samarthan se bhi sarkaar banane kaa daawa pesh karte hai, to rajyapal unhen bhi sarkaar gathit karne ke liye kah sakate hai
 Fifth option: Governor can take steps for President's rule in this situation if no party has the necessary MLA number to form the government

 ipel 2019 kii shuruyaat ho chuki he
 In the matches so far, the cricket fans got to see many exciting matches as expected
 kareeb do maheene chalane vaala ye safar abhi shuruaati charan main he
 This time the IPL has started like it has decided that this tournament will be exciting this time too
 duniya ke sabase bade cricket lig ke 12wein sijan ke champion ke liye bhi phens ko final tak kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 But according to the coincidence that has been made so far in the tournament before the finals, this time the champion is looking for only one and only one team, which has also captured the title 3 times in the past
 ji haa ham baat kar rahe hai mumbai indiens (MI) kii
 Usually, Mumbai Indians, who started loose in every IPL, are sitting on the sidelines of becoming champions this time
 aisa ham isliye kah rahe hai kyonki mumbai indiens ab tak jo teen baar champion bani he us toornament ke pehle match main use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa he
 And this time also in the first match, he had to face defeat against Delhi Capitals
 bataa den ki mumbai indiens 2013 main pehali baar ipel kii champion bani thi
 Subsequently in 2015, 2017 she also captured the title
 gaur karne vaali baat ye bhi he ki ek saal yaa sijan chhodkar vah champion bani
 If she became the champion in 2013, she became the champion in the post-2014 season ie 2015
 aise hi 2016 ke baad vaale 2017 ke sijan main bhi vah champion bani
 And now after 2018, another season is in front of him
 2017 main vah champion rah chuki he or 2019 kaa pehla match wo haar chuki he
 It is clear that the coincidence that is sitting this time is sitting in favor of Mumbai Indians
 haalanki toornament kaa vijeta koun hoga ye kahana to jaldbaaji hogi
 Its decision will only be known when the last ball is thrown in the final match
 2013, 2015 or 2017 main aisa tha MI kaa safar2013 main jab mumbai indiens pehali baar champion bani thi to toornament kaa pehla match usne RCB ke khilaaf khelaa tha
 He had lost 2 runs in his first match
 iske baad final mukaable main mumbai indiens ne chennai superkings ko 23 ran se haraakar shandaar jeet darj kii thi
 When Mumbai Indians became champions in 2015, they faced KKR in the first match of the tournament
 yahaan bhi use pehle match main 7 wicket se haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 But after this, in the final match, Mumbai Indians defeated Chennai Super Kings by 41 runs
 vahiin 2017 main bhi use toornament ke pehle match main haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 On 6 April 2017, he lost by 7 wickets in this match played against Rising Pune Supergiant
 haalanki is haar badla mumbai indiens ne final main le liya tha
 In the final match, he defeated Pune by 1 run
 baat 2019 kii karen to is baar bhi use pehle match main dilli capitals ke khilaaf haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In this match played on 24 March, Delhi Capitals beat Mumbai Indians by 37 runs
 ab in sabhi parinaamon ko dekhte hue jo sanyog ban rahe hai wo mumbai indiens ke paksh main jarur ja rahe hai, lekin champion to team maidan main khelkar banati he
 This coincidence can definitely inspire a team like Mumbai Indians to do well in this tournament

 'he said,' Whenever any health related issue arises, we have a group which looks at all these things
 physio dwaara har cheez dekhi jaati he or bayaan main bhi ise spasht rup se diya gaya he
 Prasad also said that Mahendra Singh Dhoni was scheduled to return to the T20 squad for the New Zealand tour, as he has been rested for only six T20 Internationals against the West Indies and Australia
 prasad ne kaha, ‘mahendra singh dhoni ke sambandh main, jab unhen aaraam diya tha, to hamane kaha tha ki unhen in chah maichon ke liye aaraam diya jayega, taaki ham dinesh karthik or rishabh pant ko zyada mauka de saken
 This was the main reason
 ab ve kuch match khel chuke hai, to hamane sochaa ki hamen mahendra singh dhoni ko phir se team main waapas laana chahie
 He said of the decision to keep Rishabh Pant out of the ODI team against Australia and New Zealand, which was done to keep him fresh for the big challenges ahead
 unhone aashwast kiya ki yah yuva wicketiper ab bhi 2019 vishwa cap kii daud main shaamil he
 The chief selector informed that from now on only 20 players will play as a core team till the World Cup
 unhone kaha, ‘jaisaa ki vaada kiya gaya tha, hamane kaha tha ki ham vishwa cap ke kareeb bad rahe hai or hamaare paas keval 13 vanade hi bache hai
 It is now like a core team
 hamane 20 khilaadiyon ko chunaa he or keval ye 20 sadsy hi ab se khelenge

 Chidambaram has said that the citizens there do not have any means to live in our country without their approval
 iske saath hi unhone bangladeshiyon ke liye badi sankhya main visa jari karne ke auchity par bhi sawaal uthaaya
 Chidambaram, who is keeping a close watch on the security situation after the Mumbai attacks, expressed concern over the ineffective surveillance system to keep a watch on Bangladeshis coming to India and not returning after the visa expired
 assam or pashchim bengal main avaidh bangladeshiyon ke kaaran bade paimaane par jansankhya pattern badlaav kaa zikr karte hue unhone kaha,'bangladeshiyon ko muslim yaa gaiyr-muslim ke rup main nahin dekhtaa hum
 He is a Bangladeshi and has no means of coming to India without a visa

" ' Politics is hot in Delhi, on the one hand, while the Aam Aadmi Party is attacking the central government and the BJP for cutting trees, the BJP is attacking the Kejriwal government on the issue of water and electricity
 dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki kejariwal sarkaar ke paas jo adhikaar he, us par kaam nahin karte
 Therefore, to divert the attention of the public, they choose issues every day and do politics on it
 tiwari ne kaha ki dilli ke kai ilaakon main pani kii killat he, kejariwal pani or bijli par koi baat karne ko raji nahin hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused the Arvind Kejriwal government, along with the power distribution companies, of a scam of Rs 800 crore in the name of increasing the load of electricity connection
 dilli sarkaar kii bhagidaari vaali bijli vitaran companiyaan upabhoktaaon se lagbhag 23000 megawatt lod ke aadhaar par sthaayee shulk vasuul rahi hai
 While the Delhi government itself says that the demand for electricity in Delhi is around 7000 MW, the power companies are charging money on the basis of 23,000 MW load from Delhi people
 is tarah se dilli sarkaar pratimah janata se lagbhag 287 karod rupee discom ko dilava rahi he
 Along with this, it is also giving a subsidy of 200 crores per month to DISCOM
 yani bijli companiyon abhi tak upabhoktaaon se 800 karod rupee zyada vasuul chuki hai, to vahiin salanaa 2400 karod banataa he
 Taking a dig, the BJP said that the Kejriwal government knows that now only a few days of 2019 elections are left, the issue of a full state is being raised while water and electricity are completely under the Kejriwal government
 isliye pani nahin mil rahaa he or bijli companiyon ko phayda pahunch rahaa he
 Let us know that Delhi BJP will protest against the issue of electricity from Saturday

 India can also win this Test match against Australia
 kyonki australian team ke pichley aankadon par najar daalen to kangaaroon ke liye ye paristhiti anukool nahin lag rahi
 Let's look at this interesting fact that makes Australia vulnerable
 kangaaroon ko raas nahin aati toss jeet kar pehle battingpune test main australia ne toss jeeta or pehle khilne kaa faisla kiya
 This is the seventh consecutive time in India that he won the toss and decided to bat first
 lekin gaur karne vaali baat yah he ki isse pehle chah baar toss jeet kar pehle ballebaaji karte hue australia ne bharat ke khilaaf match ganvaaya he
 So now there is a round of speculation as to whether Australia will lose this match? After four years in India, the first ball of the Test was struck by Matt Renshaw on the first ball of the Chaukapune Test, that ball was thrown by Ishant Sharma
 darasal, chaar saal main pehla mauka he, jab kisi mehmaan team ke khilaadi ne bharat ke khilaaf test match kii pehali gend par chaukaa lagaaya ho

 By shifting the residents of such houses to alternate places, the houses should be demolished so that no accident occurs and people can be safe
 ek bhi colony main sabhi buniyadi suvidhaayen nahinvipaksh ke netaa ne aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar ne vaada kiya tha ki ek saal ke andar 200 anaadhikrut coloniyon ko ve sabhi suvidhaayen uplabdh kara di jaaengi

 Even if he brings an action-packed film like Raees, nobody can forget King Khan's romantic style during the promotion
 aise main aap soch rahe honge ki aakhir romance ke is star ne apana vailentains de kaise manaaya hoga
 Actually, you will be able to imagine the Valentine's Day as Shah Rukh has celebrated, because Shahrukh Khan has chosen not his wife but his 5-year-old son to celebrate this love-filled festival and that's why Shah Rukh Khan's nuns are one of them
 Again in discussion
 tippaniyan Shahrukh Khan has set out for a night walk on Juhu with his son Abram

 ek intervyuu ke dauraan jab shahrukh se poocha gaya ki vah ghar par sabase zyada kise yaad karte hai to unhone abram kaa naam liya
 Shahrukh said, Whenever i am outside, i take time out for Aryan or Suhana, but when i go out of the house, i get away from Abram

 display ('adslotnativevideo'); }); shahrukh ne kaha, abram se itane lagaav kii ek vajah shaayad yah ho sakati he ki vah hamaari jindagi main der se aayaa he
 That's why we give him so much love
 unhone bataaya, jab bhi main ghar se kahin ja rahaa hota hum to koshish karata hum ki abram mere saath hi chale
 In an interview, Shah Rukh also told that during the train journey from Mumbai to Delhi for the film Raees, he felt that he should have taken Abram along

 shahrukh ne kaha, main jab bhi baahar hota hum aryan yaa suhana ke liye time nikaal letaa hum, lekin ghar se baahar jane par main abram se dur ho jaataa hum
 Shah Rukh said, one of the reasons for his attachment to Abram may be that he has come late in our life
 isliye ham use itnaa pyaar dete hai
 He told, whenever i am going somewhere from home, i try to keep Abram with me

 com / gb53l1hjvk The Modi government at the Center has taken a major step towards providing bullet proof jackets provided for paramilitary forces, army and state police
 jaankaree ke mutabik ab indian standard ke aadhaar par bharat main pehali baar bullate pruf jacket taiyaar kii jaaengi
 The 6 level bullet proof jacket will be manufactured under the Bureau of Indian Standards i
e
 BIS standard
 bharat main isse pehle bullate pruf jacket neshnal institute of justise (NIS) america ke standard par taiyaar hoti thi
 Such bullet proof jackets ranged from level 1 to label 4
 lekin ab bharat main jis maanak str par bullate pruf jacket taiyaar kii jaaengi unka standard level 1 se lekar level 6 tak hoga yani yah bullate pruf jacket khatarnaak steel bullate ko bhi jhel paane main sakasham hogi
 Let me tell you that there are about 20 lakh military, paramilitary forces and police forces of the states in India, which require bullet proof jackets in many adverse circumstances
 ab jabaki bharat ke maanak ke aadhaar par bullate pruf jacket taiyaar hongi to in bullate pruf jacket ke prokorment yani inako kharidne main zyada deree kaa saamana nahin karnaa padegaa
 Actually, before that whenever India had to buy a bullet proof jacket, it had to first take a recommendation from the American National Institute of Justice (NIS) standard, but now that the standard of bullet proof jacket has been prepared in India itself
 So there will be no delay in the procurement of bullet proof jackets
 dilli main aaj is silsile main indian standard on bullate pruf registence jacket ke maanak ko dene ke liye ek program kaa aayojan kiya gaya
 It was initiated by Prof

 It is not easy to raise voice against the orthodox customs of society, but a 19-year-old girl in Jodhpur did something similar
 shanta devi meghavaal ne 11 maheene main kiye gaye uske bal vivaah ko thukraa diya
 Shanta Devi's family is poor, the father works as an artisan in building houses, and when Shanta was an 11-month-old girl, she was married to her elder sister, but Shanta did not know anything about it
 iske baad parivaar jodhpur aa gaya, shanta ab bie second year kii student he
 Three years ago he came to know about the wedding
 ladkaa usase 9 saal bada he or kam padhaa-likhaa bhi
 Then Shanta explained to the parents that she wants to reject the marriage, the parents agreed to it, but now the caste panchayat is coming in the way
 kah rahi he 16 lakh rupee jamaa karwaao, tabhi shaadi tut sakegi
 The panchayat has heard the Taliban's decree to get out of the fraternity and to stop the hookah-water on refusing to accept child marriage, but Shanta wants to be free from the shackles of this child marriage and choose her life partner as her own teacher, So that it can give new direction to the society
 is ladaai main shanta devi kaa parivaar uskaa saath de rahaa he, jiske liye samaaj ke panchon ne puure parivaar kaa saamaajik bahishkaar karte hue 16 lakh rupee kaa arthdand lagane kaa farmaan jari kiya he, anyathaa shanta devi ko sasuraal bhejne ke liye jabaran dhamkaaya ja rahaa he
 The comments shanta devi jainarayan vyas vishvavidhyalay main bie dwitiya varsh main adhyayanrat he
 Her husband Sanvalaram is less educated
 vahiin isi parivaar main shanta devi kii badi bahan kaa vivaah ho chukaa he, jiske saath bhi sasuraal main atyaachaar kiya ja rahaa he tathaa uski bahan ko bhi sasuraal se bedakhal karne kii dhamkee di ja rahi he
 For the cancellation of child marriage, the victim and her family contacted Kriti Bharti, the managing trustee of Sarathi Trust and narrated her agony
 peedita ke pita padmaram meghavaal ne apni beti shantadevi kii khushi ke liye yah vivaah nirast karwaane kii himmat kii, jis par puraa samaaj uske khilaaf lamaband hokar khadaa ho gaya
 The trust says that first they will talk to the in-laws and give an opinion about breaking the marriage and if they do not agree then they will follow the law
 shanta devi kaa parivaar garib he, pita makaan banane main karigar kaa kaam karte hai or jab shanta 11 maheene kii bacchee thi to uski shaadi kar badi bahan ke saath kar di gai thi, lekin shanta ko iskaa kuch pataa nahin chalaa
 After this, the family moved to Jodhpur, Shanta is now a BA second year student
 teen saal pehle usko shaadi ke baar main pataa chalaa
 The boy is 9 years older than him and less educated
 phir shanta ne maa-baap ko samajhaayaa ki vah shaadi thukraana chaahati he, maa baap ne uski baat maan lee, lekin ab jati panchayat aade aa rahi he
 Saying, deposit 16 lakh rupees, then the marriage will be broken
 panchayat ne bal-vivaah maanane se inkaar kar dene par birdari se baahar karne va hukka-pani band karne kaa talibani farmaan suna diya he, lekin shanta is bal-vivaah kii bediyon se aaazaad hokar apni marji se apana jeevanasathi chunakar shikshak bananaa chaahati he, jisase vah samaaj ko nai disha pradaan kar sake
 Shanta Devi's family is supporting her in this fight, for which the Panchs of the society have issued a decree to impose a fine of Rs
16 lakhs while socially boycotting the whole family, otherwise Shanta Devi is being forcibly threatened for sending her in-laws
 is
 tippaniyan Shanta Devi Jayanarayan is studying in second year BA at Vyas University
 vahi uskaa pati saanvalram kam padhaa likhaa he

 ishrat jahaan maamle main 3 july ko sibiai kii ore se daayar 1,500 pannon ke pehle aaropapatr ne javaabon se zyada sawaal khadey kar die hai
 In this, the encounter of Gujarat Police on June 15, 2004 with four people including Ishrat, a 19-year-old student of Mumbai, has been described as fake or straightforward murder
 isamen gujarat police ke saat adhikariyon ko aaropee banaaya gaya he par isamen is baat kaa khulaasa nahin he ki ishrat aatankwaadi thi yaa nahin
 The most interesting thing is that it has avoided taking the name of any leader
 lekin yah aaropapatr siyaasi aakaaon kii madad ke liye surahna or khufia agenciyon ke aapas main haath mila lene kii ek bhayankar tasviir pesh karata he
 So far, the working of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), which has been working under the cover of secrecy, has raised questions in public for the first time
 is tarah se ibi or sibiai ke bich ek ghatiya kism kii ladaai chhid chuki he
 According to the CBI, the encounter was planned by Gujarat's Subsidiary IB (SIB), which operates under the IB at the center and the police in the state
 aaropapatr ke mutabik, 2001 se 2005 tak gujarat kii esaibi ke mukhiya rahe ibi ke vishesh nideshak rajendra kumaar ne rajya ke atirikt dijipi pi

 Yes

 Kumar had informed that Ishrat and three others — Pranesh Pillai aka Javed Sheikh, Amjad Ali Rana and Zeeshan Johar — are lashkar-e-taiba terrorists and have gone to kill Narendra Modi
 police team ne unhen agava karke avaidh rup se chhipaakar rakhaa or unka ''katl” karne se pehle unhen drug diya gaya
 The issue of giving drugs was not in the charge sheet but it was confirmed by CBI officials in an informal press conference
 muthbhed ko jaij tehraane ke liye shaikh kii car main rakhe gaye or ''ugravadiyon” ke haath main thamaaye gaye hathiyaar esaibi ne muhaiyaa karaae the
 Actually, the FIR of the encounter was written before it happened
 sibiai kii padtaal ke hawaale se aaropapatr main yah baat kahi gai he
 Kumar's name in this but his and three other IB officers are not in the list of accused
 sibiai ke ek afasar kaa kahana he ki kumaar, pi
 Mittal, M
 ke
 Sinha and Rajiv Wankhede may be charged in another charge sheet
 vajah: jaanch main abhi kuch pahaluon ko abhi sabit kiya janaa he
 Kumar is scheduled to retire on 31 July
 pandey faraar hai or nilambit vanjaaraa jail main hai
 The chargesheet is also silent on whether the four killed were let operatives or not
 lashkar ke ek ahm gurgey mujammil or ishrat ke saathi javed shaikh ke bich bharat par aatankwaadi hamale se sambandhit tepe baatcheet ko isamen spasht nahin kiya gaya he
 IB chief Asif Ibrahim himself told the office of the Prime Minister and Union Home Minister that apart from Ishrat and Sheikh, the two Pakistanis who were accompanying him were also let operatives who had gone on a mission to kill some leaders
 varisht vakil ke
 T
 es
 Tulsi says that there is no sense that Ishrat or others were terrorists or had relationships with terrorists
 unke shabdon main, ''police jallaad thode hi he
 If he was happy, he should have been prosecuted and not killed
 yah saaf-saaf hatya he
 "he believes that the CBI should also surround political masters," he is not above the law "
 ek or kanoonvid naam na chhapane kii shart par kehete hai ki sibiai ke muthbhed ko farji bataane ke liye police or ibi afasaron ko ghere main lene kaa siyaasi asar bhi padegaa hi
 According to him, "CBI has not taken anyone's name from political masters but its beating has reached far
" ” isse modi ko nishaanaa banane ke liye congress ko paryaapt masala mil jayega
 a senior Gujarat lawyer questions the charge sheet
 "despite the charge sheet being filed nine years after the incident, it neither reveals the conspiracy nor the motive behind the killing of the four
" ”ek sibiai afasar ke paas iskaa jawaab hajir he
 In his words, "it's like a win for everybody
" ibi ko sateek input kaa shrey tha to police ko padtaal or aatankwaadiyon ke safaaye kaa
 For Modi, it was an opportunity to present himself as a leader who was threatened by terrorists
 ”yah dekhnaa mjedaar he ki upie sarkaar kis tarah iske jhamele main funs gai
 The cbi's charge sheet says things other than the 14-page affidavit submitted by the Union Home Ministry on August 6, 2009
 ishrat or shaikh ke pariwaron ko maasoom bataate hue unke incounter ko chunauti dene par sarkaar ne gujarat hycourt main yah halafanama pesh kiya tha
 In it, he said that both Ishrat and Sheikh were let operatives
 shaikh viviypi vyaktiyon ko nishaanaa banane kii sajeesh rachane ke liye jimmedaar lashkar ke mujammil ke lagaataar sampark main tha or mujammil ne ishrat ko isliye network main shaamil kiya tha taaki ve pati-patni hone kaa naatak karte hue apni gatividhiyon ke liye hindustan bhar main beficri se gum saken
 The affidavit stated that Sheikh met Muzammil during his stay in Oman in march-april 2004
 yah muthbhed se tinek maheene pehle kii baat thi
 Also, the Central Government knew that Lashkar was planning to kill top national and state leaders
 baharhaal, modi sarkaar ne adaalat main jab is halafname kaa hawala diya to centre sarkaar ne 29 sitambar, 2009 ko ek doosraa halafanama daakhil kar diya, jisamen usne ishrat or shaikh se sambandhit apane pehle ke daavon se inkaar to nahin kiya, lekin use nirnaayak saboot nahin balki saamaanya kism kaa input bataakar use halkaa kar diya
 It said that it was the job of the state government to "examine and act on the evidence"
 ” ab centre sarkaar yah kehete hue sibiai jaanch kii maang kaa samarthan kar rahi he ki use sibiai jaanch se koi gurej na tha
 BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitaraman says, "now the first affidavit filed by the central government in this case is matched with the chargesheet filed by the CBI, then the political intent behind it clearly comes out
 ”modi kii ranneeti ab yah hogi ki is maamle main aropit police afasar unke khilaaf gavaahi na den
 If any accused senior officer of Gujarat Police takes his name, then CBI can comfortably hold Modi's election chariot
 saath hi saath modi khud ko satai aatma ke rup main pesh kar zyada-se-zyada phayda bhi uthaanaa chahenge

 Targeting the head of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, Gandhi alleged that he changed the design of the project which increased its cost from 38 thousand crore to one lakh crore rupees
 unhone aarope lagaaya, 'ise (pariyojna ko) ek lakh karod kaa kyon banaaya gaya? kyonki mukhyamantri bhrashtachar karnaa chaahate the

 ) The Supreme Court has issued notices to the government and the Reserve Bank including Union Bank and Canara Bank for banks not complying with the reverse mortgage facility available to senior citizens
 upi ke mainpuri main rahane vaale senior citijan empi singh kii yachika par supreme court ne yah notice di he
 MP Singh had complained that the senior citizens are not following this good facility provided by the senior citizen and the elderly have to pay bribes for it many times
 empi singh ne is bare main kai baar rigerv bank tathaa sarkaar se shikaayat kii,lekin koi karrwai nahin hui
 What happens Under a reverse mortgage mortgage, senior citizens can pledge their property to a bank to live, and the property is returned after the money is returned
 ise ek tarah kii ritairement skim samajha ja saktaa he, jiske tahat senior citigen apnipropertigirvee rakhkar apana jeevanyaapan karne ke liye bank se lone le sakate hai
 Actually, it is like the reverse of home loan, so it is called reverse mortgage
 home lone lene vaala vyakti har maheene iemi ke dwaara lone chukaata he, jabaki reverse mortges main senior citigen ko apana kharch chalaane ke liye har maheene ek nishchit rakam milti he
 The outstanding arrears of the senior citizen can be withdrawn by repaying it at any time by adding interest, etc
 on this loan
 yadi senior citigen kaa is paise ko chukaaye bina nidhan ho jaataa he, to uski santan lone kii bakaayaa rakam chukaaye bina property nahin le sakati
 If the child does not repay the loan amount, then the property becomes the bank
 bhuulane kii beemaari nai nahin he
 Often people forget a lot of things
 magar aap aise kaatil ke bare main kya kahenge jo ye kahe ki use das katl tak kii ginati to yaad he uske baad kii ginati yaad nahin
 And he also remembered this count of ten when the police caught him just for the murder
 ye kaatil darasal pehle lutere hai
 But the habit is that after plunder they do not leave their victim alive
 kuch vakt pehle enie ke ek police afasar kaa katl haa tha
 This murderer also did this murder
 is duniya mencyrial kilorsato bahut hue or bahut se jite ji kisse-kahaniyon kaa hissaa ban gaye
 But Munir and Ashutosh Mishra, who were caught by the police, are that new pair of serial killers, around whom no other serial killer of this era can stand
 inhone kitne katl kiye, ginati yaad nahin
 Do you know why? Because in the cases of murder and looting, these psycho serial killers have gone so far that now they do not even remember themselves properly how many lives they have taken and how many crores of rupees have been looted
 or ye baat koi or nahin, balki munir or ashutosh naam ke in gangstaron ko giraftaar karne vaali police khud apni jubaan se kah rahi he
 Many cases have been registered, Munir and his partner Ashutosh, who have been the scavengers of the police for almost two years, remember the count of ten murders
 lekin iske aage nahin
 Munir was arrested from Greater Noida, UP on June 28
 lekin chunki uske khilaaf dilli main bhi bahut se maamle darj the, dilli police use transit remand par lekar ai, lekin jab poochtacha shuru hui to ek ke baad usne itani vaardaaton kii baat kubul kii ki khud pulisavaalon ke liye hisaab milaanaa mushkil hone laga
 But this was only one aspect of his passion for crime
 munir kitna beraham he, iskaa andaja bas isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki wo lut or dakaiti to karata he, lekin is kaam main agar koi ek pal ke liye bhi uske aade aa jaae, to use goli maarane main wo jaraa bhi der nahin karata
 The policeman does not leave even the policeman is merciless, he also hates the policemen
 kuch itnaa ki jab bhi use koi pulisavaala akelaa najar aata he, wo sidhe use goli maar detaa he or fouran uskaa hathiyaar chin kar bhaag nikalataa he
 Then with these weapons, he also performs the next incident of looting
 police kii maane to ab tak chaar se zyada pulisavaalon kaa katl kar chukaa he or kai maamle bhul chukaa he
 But these are strange and shocking stories of his crazy mood
 kai agenciyaan peeche padinmunir shaayad ab bhi pakad main nahin aata or naa hi uske serial killer hone kii baat aam hoti
 Had he not killed NIA DSP Tanjil Ahmed
 lekin sirf shaq ke chalate usne naa sirf tanzeel ahamed or unki bivi kaa katl kar diya, balki nafrat main tanzeel ko 24 goliyaan bhi maarin
 And just after this, several different agencies including NIA and UP STF followed him
 shaq ko lekar tanzeel ko marajurm kii duniya main munir apni jaden to kaaphi pehle jamaa chukaa tha
 But after taking the life of Tanjil Ahmed, for the first time his name came in the headlines and not only UP Police but many agencies including NIA and UP STF followed him
 darasal, munir ne apane kuch doston ke saath disambar 2015 main bijanour ke dhampur main ek bank dakaiti daali
 91 lakh rupees were robbed in this robbery
 iske baad se hi bijanour police munir ke peeche padi thi or munir ko lag rahaa tha ki tanzeel police ko uski khabar bataa rahe hai, or bas isi shaq main usne tanzeel kii jaan le lee
 What happened to Tanjil in connection with the property, the ghost of Chichtimunir being rich with loot money, can only be gauged from the crores of rupees looted from different banks, ATM centers and businessmen
 Taburtod was buying property in UP
 or to or property kii kharid-farokht ke silsile main bhi uski kai baar dspi tanzeel ahamed se baatcheet hui thi
 But later he started doubting Tanjil himself
 phone nahin rakhata tha munirpulice kii maane to munir ek psyco killer to he hi, wo police ke kaam karne ke taur tareeke se bhi bahut acchhee tarah se waakif he
 This is the reason why he never even used a mobile phone to avoid surveillance
 or isi vajah se wo ek ke baad ek laashen bichhaata rahaa, bank luutata rahaa, lekin saalon saal police ke liye chhalaava bana rahaa
 Despite the robbery at the ATM of Delhi's Kamla Market, the police were deceived when their hands remained empty despite the fact that all the mobile numbers active in the area were trashed during the crime
 jaankaar bataate hai ki police afasaron se munir kii dosti uske is modes oprendi kii ek ahm vajah thi
