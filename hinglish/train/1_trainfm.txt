 aapane gujarat ke mukhyamantri narendra modi ko gujarat ke vikaas ke bade-bade daawey karte hue suna hoga
 But Gujarat also has a face that proves Modi's claims to be hollow
 shaayad us gujarat ko modi nahin jaanate yaa jaanboojhkar us taraf dekhnaa hi nahin chaahate
 According to Modi, Gujarat's development model should also be implemented in the country
 agar gujarat main vikaas kii bayaar bah rahi he, to phir kyon suicide kar rahe hai gujarat ke kisaan? aksar modi gujarat ke garv ke daawey thokate hai, phir 4 saalon main 112 kisaanon ne kyon kii aatmahatya? modi khud ko vikaas purush kehete hai, phir unhen kyon nahin dikhti apane hi rajya ke kisaanon kii majaburi?aapane gujarat main vikaas ke bade-bade daawey sune honge
 Modi also talks big about the prosperity of farmers in Gujarat
 modi ko kehete suna hoga ki gujarat chamak rahaa he, lekin us chamak kaa ek hissaa aisa syah he jiske bare main sunakar aap bhi chaunk jaaenge
 Due to drought and debt, farmers of Gujarat are forced to commit suicide
 lekin lagata he modi ko isaki koi parvaah nahin
 Read the sad tales of a farmer, but the situation of many other farmers is no different
 ‘barish naa hone kii vajah se meri fasal barbaad ho gai he
 Banks and other loans also increased
 hamen sarkaar kii ore se kisi bhi tarah kii koi madad nahin mili he

 The government has not given us the money for crop protection insurance that we took in 2005 till date

 Meanwhile, the SDM of Dwarka in Jamnagar also ordered the police to register Anirudh Singh's letter as a dyeing declaration and take further action
 lekin saat maheenon se aniruddh singh jadeja kaa parivaar intjaar hi kar rahaa he
 Neither crop protection insurance money was received nor suicide compensation declared
 kitni ajeeb baat he ki ek taraf kisaan aatmahatya kar rahe hai, to duusari ore narendra modi kisaanon se hamadardi ke naare hawa main oochaal rahe hai
 Modi holds a fair for the farmers and claims that his government is not for the chair but for agriculture
 narendra modi ke in daavon ke saath aniruddh singh kii aatmahatya kii majaburi ko milakar dekhie to ek alag kism kaa gujraat najar aata he
 Helpless Gujarat, yearning and yearning Gujarat
 kya narendra modi ne apane is gujarat ko kabhi vaaki nahin dekha? aatmahatya se pehle likhi gai aniruddh singh kii chitthee puch rahi he, nahin dekha to kyon nahin dekha?pichley chaar saal main gujarat ke 112 kisaanon ne aatmahatya kar lee
 The most affected areas are Saurashtra and Kutch
 lekin modi daawa karte hai ki gujarat main krishi vikaas dar do akon main he
 Now questions are being raised on this claim of Modi
 narendra modi in dinon gujarat main krishi mela lagaakar kisaanon kii khushhaali kii khub baaten kar rahe hai
 Narendra Modi teaches the world the lessons of modern and organic agriculture
 or gujarat main krishi vikaas dar ke do ankon main hone ke daawey bhi karte hai narendra modi
 But there is another aspect of the picture
 wo pahalu jise yaa to modi jaanate nahin yaa phir jaanboojhkar dekhnaa nahin chaahate
 According to the data provided with the help of RTI, 112 farmers of Gujarat have committed suicide from 1 January 2008 to 19 August 2012
 aapako jaankaar hairaani hogi ki sirf 2012 main hi 65 kisaanon ne suicidakiya he
 In the five months from June 2012 to October 2012, 42 farmers committed suicide due to drought
 jaankaar maanate hai ki kisaanon kii khudakushi ke liye sirf or sirf modi kii nitiyaan jimmedaar hai
 Social activist of Ahmedabad Bharat Singh Jhala says, i believe that due to the policy of the government, farmers are committing suicide, the government has not given crop protection insurance to a farmer even after the drought in Gujarat last year
 
 bhale hi gujarat ke chamakane kii baaten kii ja rahi hai, krishi vikaas dar ke do ankon main hone ke daawey kiye ja rahe hai lekin jaankaar maanate hai ki sab aankadon kaa khel he
 Questions are being raised that suddenly 1
 72% se 10
 How did agriculture growth rate of 59%? Why 2000-2001 was the base year for calculating the growth rate from 1998-99? The question is urgent because the farmers who are making big claims about Modi, feel that the government neither has anything for them She is neither doing nor listening to his words
 ab sawaal ye ki badi-badi baaten karne vaale, duniya ko gujarat kii chamak-damak dikhaane vaale modi ko gujarat kaa ye cheharaa kyon nahin dikhataa

 (IANS input ke saath) Chief Minister Raghuvar Das on Thursday withdrew the state cabinet's decision to increase VAT on diesel
 siem ne kaha ki waite badhaane ke cabinet ke faisle kii vajah se dijal ke mulya main 4
 There was to be an increase of Rs 20 per liter, which would not happen now
 dijal par waite badhaane ke faisle kaa kadaa virodh hone ke baad ise waapas liya gaya he
 The cabinet decided on Tuesday to increase VAT on diesel and petrol
 usamen dijal ke mulya main nunatam 12
 5 per liter or 22 per cent (which would be more), it was fixed to be VAT
 jabaki petrol ke maamle main 15 rupee prati litre yaa 22 fisadi (jo adhik hoga) utana waite liye jane kaa faisla hua tha
 Asked about the withdrawal of VAT on petrol, the Chief Minister said that the decision in the case of petrol is still intact, but it will be reconsidered in view of the VAT levied on petrol by the neighboring states
 kya or kitna asararatan kumaar ne bataaya ki vartmaan main jharkhand main petrol kii keemat 60 rupee 27 paise prati litre he, jisamen waite kaa hissaa 22 fisadi kii dar se 10 rupee pachaas paise prati litre he or yah mantrimandal ke mangalvaar ke faisle ke kaaran ab 15 rupee prati litre ho jayega or petrol kii kul keemat lagbhag saadhe chaar rupee prati litre badhkar 64 rupee 77 paise prati litre ho jaaegi
 Similarly, in Jharkhand, the share of VAT in Jharkhand at the current rate of 47 rupees 41 paise per liter at 22 per cent is only about eight rupees thirty paise per liter, which will come to a minimum of 12 rupees fifty paise per liter after the implementation of the new decision
 
 iske kaaran jharkhand main dijal lagbhag chaar rupee bees paise prati litre mahangaa hokar kul 51 rupee 61 paise prati litre ho jayega
 Opposition protested The state government was disturbed by the recent decline in its revenue due to continuous decrease in petrol and diesel prices and that is why the cabinet has taken such a decision
 is bich guuruuvaar ko rajya kii mukhya vipakshi partiyon jharkhand mukti morcha, jharkhand vikaas morcha or congress ne petrol or dijal ke daam main vruddhi kaa ghor virodh kiya
 Jhavimo leader Pradeep Yadav accused Chief Minister Raghuvar Das of pretending to run the government of the common man and said that such increase in the price of petrol and diesel shows that this government is really for the rich

 The Congress high command is preparing to move ahead with the new formula in Haryana
 bijepi hi nahin balki congress bhi haryana main jat netritv se parhez kar rahi he
 The Congress has planned to hand over the command of the party from one Dalit to another Dalit in the state
 mana ja rahaa he ki jald hi congress pradesh adhyaksh ashok tanvar ko pad se hataakar unki jagah kumari shailaja ko pradesh main party kii kaman saunpi ja sakati he
 Let us know that in Haryana, the battle for supremacy has been going on for a long time between Congress state president Ashok Tanwar and former Chief Minister of the state Bhupinder Singh Hooda
 hooda is baat par ade the ki rajya main party kii kaman ashok tanvar se lekar unke gut ke kisi sadsy ko saunpi jaae
 According to sources, the Congress is ready to accept Hooda's removal of Tanwar, but the party is against giving the command to any member of his camp
 iske baad hooda bhi peeche hatane ko taiyaar ho gaye hai
 Now he agrees to replace Ashok Tanwar as the new president
 party ne aise main rajya keedlit mahila netaa kumari shailajako party kii kaman dene kii yojana banaai he, jis par hooda raji ho gaye hai
 In a recent meeting, party vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Congress general secretary Kamal Nath held talks with several senior leaders of the state, including Hooda
 isamen tanvar kii jagah kumari shailaja ko laane par sahmati bani
 Along with Ashok Tanwar, the Leader of Opposition in Haryana Legislative Assembly Kiran Chaudhary is also being considered as a holiday and any member of Hooda camp can be replaced as Leader of Opposition
 gauratlab he ki bhupinder singh hooda jat samaaj se aate hai or rajya main jat matadaataaon kii sankhya acchhee khaasi he
 The Dalits are the second largest population in the state after Jats
 congress ashok tanvar ko hataakar hooda kheme ke kisi sadsy ko detii to iskaa daliton main sandesh galat jaataa
 For this reason, the Congress is moving forward with a new formula so that Dalits cannot be offended along with Jat
 congress netritv ko lag rahaa he ki pradesh congress cameti or congress vidhayak dal main dalit-jat kii jodi se party ko rajya main phir se ubhaara ja saktaa he
 The Congress feels that if the two voters unite, then the party may wave in the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly elections
 congress ko lagata he ki haryana main khatter sarkaar ke aane ke baad jat or dalit donon haashie par aa gaye hai or khud ko alag-thalag mahasoos kar rahe hai
 In such a state, the dalit-jat pair may prove to be lifesaving for him

 Failure to transform the Indian Civil Service from a post-colonial era institution dedicated to development, poverty alleviation and change is one of the biggest obstacles to India's progress

 Today, with the progress in digitization, such claims are being made that the Aadhaar scheme alone has eliminated about 20 lakh fake beneficiaries, but the mechanism on which the government's slogans and promises have the responsibility to take the ground is still functioning
 Plays on paper only

 It is expected that with the amendment to the Prevention of Corruption Act, the provisions of which say that a bureaucrat cannot be prosecuted without the permission of the government, the bureaucracy will have no more excuse for its inaction
 lekin isse rajanetaaon or baabuon ke bich kii sathganth ke or pakkaa hone kaa khatra bhi he
 These problems directly affect the quality of governance

 Clearly, extensive scale reform is needed

 These ranged from setting up training institutes to training experts to engaging in governance, choosing people through a competency-based recruitment system, and giving them bureaucratic responsibilities at a lower level after rigorous training
 koi bhi suzav lagu nahin kiya gaya
 Our cover story, presented by Editor (research) Ajit Kumar Jha, reviews the current state of India's bureaucracy in light of some recent changes

 However, these measures also look exactly the same as we would be happy to put rubber wheels in bullock carts that we have updated our car when the need was to change the vehicle

 railway kii ore se sharton ke saath asi chairkaar ke basic kiraye main 25 fisadi kii chhot milegi
 The scheme will come into effect from the last date of September
 lekin chhot uzhi trainon main milegi jinamein maheene main yatriyon kii sankhya 50 fisadi se kam rahi he
 That is, this scheme is not applicable in all trains
 railway adhikariyon se mili jaankaree ke mutabik, asi chairkaar or akjicutive class shrenee ke bogiyon main yatra karne vaale yatri tabhi is yojana kaa laabh le sakenge jabaki is train main yatriyon kii sankhya pichley saal 50 fisadi se kam rahi thi
 The scheme will be applicable in Shatabdi, Double Decker, Gatiman, Tejas and Intercity trains
 haalanki, chhot sirf base kiraye main milegi
 No exemption will be available in other charges like reservation fee, superfast charge or GST
 railway adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki kul kiraye main chhot kaa vikalp nahin he
 The catering service will be kept optional under the scheme
 arthath yadi yatri nahin chaahe to unhe cataring charge se mukt rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Railway sources say that there is no problem in implementing this scheme but it will be very difficult for the passengers to find out whether the train in which they are traveling will be exempted
 aisa isliye he kyonki yatriyon ko yah pataa nahin hoga ki kis shatabdi yaa phir tejas yaa is shrenee kii trainon main yatriyon kii sankhya 50 fisadi se kam rahi he yaa nahin
 The other problem is that this scheme is complicated because it is possible that in some months, for example, in October, the number of passengers in a century has been less than 50 per cent in the same month last year, then in October, the train will get a discount
 Will go
 lekin yadi pichley saal november main usee train main yatriyon kii sankhya 50 fisadi yaa isse adhik rahi he to phir chhot nahin milegi
 Not only this, there can be confusion about the fare of up and down trains
 masalan, bhopal shatabdi main yadi pichley saal november main dilli se bhopal ke yatriyon kii sankhya 50 fisadi se kam rahi he to chhot milegi
 But in the same train, if the number of passengers from Bhopal to Delhi is more than 50 percent in November last year, then there will be no exemption
 chunki yah vyavastha lagu karne kii jimmedaari mukhya vaanijya prabandhak ke jimme rahegi isliye aane or jane vaali trainon ke kiraye ko lekar gafalat ho sakati he
 However, railway officials are claiming that this scheme will increase the number of passengers

 The politics and elections that don't get done are few
 gujarat main chunaav ho rahe hai lekin dilli iske asar se achhuti nahin he
 Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti convenor Hardik Patel proves to be a big factor in Gujarat Assembly elections, it will be clear only after the results of the counting of votes on December 18
 hardik patel bijepi ke khilaaf gujarat main alakh jagaa rahe hai isliye congress kaa haathhardikka saath paakar khush he
 Hardik's rallies in Gujarat are enthusiastic about his supporters
 lekin aisa bhi nahin ki hardik ko patidaar samudaay kaa ekajute samarthan hasil he
 Some Patidars have also been raising their voice against Hardik
 aisa hi kuch najaara buudhvaar ko dekhne ko mila
 But not in any city in Gujarat, Delhi, the country's capital
 rajghat parahardikke khilaaf pradarshan kaa aayojan hua
 Some people who described themselves as members of the Patel community reached Rajghat with a banner poster and mannequin against Hardik Patel
 gale kii puri takat ke saath pehle hardik patel ke khilaaf naare lagaae gaye
 Later, the effigy of Hardik was drained out of slippers and shoes
 phir putale ko aag ke hawaale kar diya gaya
 All this was going on till today / India Today reporter wanted to take the hearts of those who expressed anger against Hardik
 iske liye sabase pehle baat kii gai pradarshan main hissaa le rahi mahila puja goud se
 The woman came to take part in a demonstration at Rajghat from Timarpur area of delhi with her young child in her arms
 unase jab aane kaa makasad poocha gaya to jawaab mila, ‘ham logon ko bolaa gaya ki rajghat chalanaa he, ghar par khaali baithe the isliye chale aae
 'wait, this is not the end of the story, but it starts from here
 ab aise yuva se baat kii gai jisane sardaar patel kii tasviir vaali safed tii shart pahan rakhi thi
 When asked about this young man named Santosh Jha against whom you are loudly shouting slogans, he got a smiling reply, "he was in BJP earlier, now why not go with Congress
 ham to hardik patel ke khilaaf pradarshan karne aae hai
 "santosh Jha further admitted with great decency that he does not know who is a Hardik Patel who? When a group of protesters went backwards, a person named Rajkumar was seen standing
 apane khyaal main khoe rajkumaar se jab poocha gaya ki wo yahaan kyon aae hai
 The answer was received with great innocence - 'slogans have come
 ’ unase sawaal kiya gaya ki kya is kaam ke liye kuch mehtaanaa bhi milegaa? is par rajkumaar ne kya kaha, unki jubaani hi suniye- ‘naare lagane ke liye aae hai, paisa diya nahin hai, kaam ho jane ke baad denge
 'this story has increased even further
 pradarshnakariyon main purush jahaan putale jalaane or naare lagane main vyast the, vahiin ek kone main kuch mahilaayein bacchon ke saath baithi dikhin
 When asked if she knew about Hardik Patel, most of them answered 'no'
 jab mahilaon se ye jaananaa chaha ki kya ve patel samudaay se hai, iskaa jawaab bhi ‘naa' main mila
 While all this was going on, some girls also came there
 ye ladkiyaan bhi bas main baith kar rajghat par pradarshan karne ai thim
 When these girls were asked the motive for their arrival, they admitted that there was no work at home and hence went to the rally here
 jab unase poocha gaya ki pradarshan main hissaa lene ke liye kya kuch paise bhi milenge, to ladakiyon ne jawaab diya ki raily khatm hone ke baad paise milenge
 One girl also told openly- 'you will get 100 rupees per hour
 'to ye tha sach kii pahchaan baapu kii samadhi ‘rajghat’ parahardik patelke khilaaf yojit ‘gambhir pradarshan’ kaa sach
 As soon as the Prime Minister announced the ban on demonetisation in the country on 8 November, the entire nation saw its own banks along with cash lying in the house
 is faisle ke nattejey se aam aadmi bank or atm kii qatari main khadaa ho gaya to bainkon ke saamne sabase badi chunauti apane-apane khataadharakon ko jald se jald notebandi ke dushprinaamon se bachaane kii thi
 Demonetisation deployed 1,38,868 bank branches in the country to change 86% of the country's currency
 yah kaam karne ke liye bainkon ko 50 din kaa samay diya gaya
 In the given period of demonetisation, almost all the banks of the country dealt with their work diligently
 iske baavjood deshbhar main kai aisi ghatnaayen dekhne ko mili jisase yahi bank notebandi ke sabase bade villen bhi banakar saamne aae
 1
 50 dinon kii miyaad main bainkon kii sabhi branchen sirf or sirf ek koshish main lagi raheen ki 500 or 1000 rupee kii puraani karency ko badalane main desh ke sava sau karod nagarikon ko kam se kam mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa pade
 2
 in sabhi bank branchon ne 50 dinon main 90 fisadi se adhik puraani karency ko jamaa kara liya
 Along with this, about 50 percent of the new currency issued by the Reserve Bank was also communicated within this given period
 3
 During this process, many small and big government and private banks, including Axis Bank, were accused of making black money white
 yahaan tak ki in aaropon ke chalate rigerv bank samet kai bainkon ke bade adhikariyon kii giraftaar tak naubat aa gai thi
 Read also: Modi government has trouble with cash but cash economy 4 is on top gear in Japan
 haalanki is miyaad ke dauraan desh ke bainkon par sabase bada sawaal yah khadaa hua ki jab kendriya bank ne nai karency ko sirf rashan karke vitarit karne kaa nirdesh diya to bazaar main kaise badi sankhya main nai karency kii baramadagi kaa maamla saamne aayaa
 5
 notebandi kii miyaad ke dauraan bainkon par ungali uthne ke saath-saath inke regulator rigerv bank par bhi sawaal khadaa hua
 Reserve Bank was also questioned in providing new currency instead of old currency to black
 6
 More serious allegations were leveled against the banks that about 21 crore Jan Dhan bank accounts opened in government banks of the country were grossly misused during the period of demonetisation
 us vakt tak desh main kul 26 karod jandhan khate the
 At the same time, immediately after the announcement of demonetisation, the increase in the pace of opening new Jan Dhan accounts led to the question that with the connivance of banks, an attempt was made to white out the black money in the old currency
 7
 The time of declaration of demonetisation has also become a problem for many families in the country
 yah vakt desh main shaadiyon ke sijan kaa tha lihaaja kai parivaar jo bank se paisa nikaal chuke the or vah bhi jinhen shaadi se thik pehle paisa nikaalnaa tha buree tarah funs gaye
 People who were upset in this case felt that the banks did not do justice to them for the day when they had relied on the bank and kept their savings
 haalanki kuch hi dinon main kendriya bank ne maamle kaa sangyaan lete hue is vishesh praavdhaan ke liye bainkon ko niyat karency se zyada dene kaa farmaan sunaaya lekin vah bhi logon kii jaruraton ko puraa karne main safal nahin hua
 8
 notebandi ke elaan ke baad sabase badi khami yah saamne ai ki kendra sarkaar ne desh kii 86 fisadi karency ko gaiyrkanoonee to qaraar de diya lekin nai karency ko logon tak pahunchane kaa pukhta intjaam nahin kiya
 It is worth noting that after the announcement of demonetisation, the government came to know that there is a technical problem in replacing the old note with the new note brought in the atms across the country, so people had to wait for 10-15 days to get the new note from the ATM
 
 9
 Now the real chance of banks becoming villains came after the demonetisation period ended
 bainkon ke aage lagi kataron or badhate kaamkaaj ke chalate desh ke lagbhag sabhi bainkon ne khataadharakon kii di jane vaali suvidhaon par charge lagaana shuru kar diya
 This charge was levied on almost all the facilities available to customers including cash transactions from banks, cash withdrawal from atms
 gauratlab he ki in nae chargees se notebandi ke maukey kaa phayda uthaate hue sabhi bainkon ne apni kamai main ijapha bhi kar liya
 Now under these circumstances, it cannot be denied that the banks of the country worked hard but due to not making advance preparations for this process, they had to become the villagers of demonetisation

 agnashya ke cancer se jujh rahe goa ke mukhyamantri (goa Chief Minister) manohar parrikar(manohar Parrikar)ne do maheene pehle hi kaha tha ki vah aakhri saans tak janata kii seva karte rahenge
 He really did his best to keep his promise

 BJP government minister in Goa Vishwajit Rane informed NDTV about Manohar Parrikar's last-time activities
 unhone kaha-
 
 
 
 ab koi doosraa manohar parrikar nahin ho saktaa
 Minister Vishwajeet Rane spoke through a recent example of how deeply Manohar Parrikar was extremely devoted to his work
 rane ne kaha,"behad biimaar avasthaa main, sharir main tub or bag laga hone par bhi lagaataar kaam karte rahe
 But i would not really understand his dedication if that day in the hospital
 
 
 
 Would not have gone to meet them
 main apane saath aspataalon se judi ek file lekar gaya tha, jisamen mukhyamantri manohar parrikar(manohar Parrikar) ke hastakshar kii jarurat thi
 He called me in through the door and said that he really wanted to sign the file i brought in
 " rane ne kaha ki yah aakhri file thi, jis par unhone hastakshar kiye
 The minister said that this example shows how selflessly he was serving Goa
 mantri ne kaha ki manohar parrikar kii ore se goa ke liye kiye gaye kaamon ko kabhi nahin bhulaayaa ja saktaa
 Although we all knew that Parrikar is very seriously ill, his demise has shocked us
 goa ke log unhen miss karenge
 After his departure, there will always be a desertion in the politics of Goa
 yah puche jaan par ki cancer jaisi beemaari kaa pataa chalane par bhi kya manohar parrikar ko sakriy raajnneeti chhod kar ghar par swasthya laabh nahin karnaa chahie tha? goa ke mantri ne kaha ki seva or samarpan kii bhaavana ne unhen kaam se dur rahane kii anumati hi nahin di
 He said- We all responsible ministers were working under his guidance

 Earlier, Agnivesh had accused Arvind Kejriwal of transferring 70 to 80 lakh rupees raised in his personal trust to India Against Corruption
 patkar india against karpshan kii mukhya samiti kii sadasya hai
 He said that the audit is on and the results will be made public soon
 patkar ne kaha ki mukhya samiti kii baithak main agnivesh maujuud nahin the, isliye vah anna kii naaraazgi ke vishay main nahin kah sakate hai
 Surely he may have misunderstood the situation

 darasal, rajya ke khufia pramukh mohammad yaccin ne buudhvaar ko rajya ke ek mantri ko unka mantrimandaleey sahyogi samaj liya

 There was a huge uproar in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly on Wednesday on Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's statements on Section 370
 vidhansabha main jab todphod hui to spikar kavinder gupta ne seshan ko ek saptaah pehle hi sin daai (sine die) kar diya
 As soon as the assembly began on Wednesday, National Conference leader and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah asked Speaker Kavinder Gupta whether he had removed the statement of Article 370 of Mehbooba Mufti from the House's record
 iske saath hi unhone yah bhi jaananaa chaha ki mahabuuba mufti kab is maamle par apana bayaan degi
 As soon as the speaker started speaking on the matter, the entire opposition came to the well and started the uproar and the uproar became so much that some mlas jumped chairs and mikes
 neshnal conference or congress ne kaha he ki agarajammu kashmir kii mukhyamantri mahabuuba muftine vidhansabha main kaha he ki jo artical 370 ke khilaaf kaam karte he vah anti neshnal he or baad main spikar ne kaha ki vah assembly kaa record dekhenge or uske baad us shabd ko nikaal denge
 Both the parties say that only BJP talks about breaking Article 370 and with that the PDP has formed the government, this means that the BJP party is the Anti National Party
 haalanki, pidipi mahabuuba mufti ke bayaan ko lekar chuppi saadhe hua he lekinbijepi kaa kahana he ki spikar kavinder guptane mahabuuba ke anti neshnal bayaan ko hataa diya he
 BJP has said that there is no change on their Article 370 policy and the party has formed an alliance to form the government

 David Coleman Headley returned to Mumbai almost seven years after boarding a flight to Chicago to never return
 haalanki is baar vah aadhi duniya ko paar karke aae video signlon ke marfat usee shahar kii ek satr adaalat ke khachaakhach bhare kamare main lautaa tha, jahaan usne 26 november 2008 ke aatanki hamalon ke dauraan 166 logon ke katleam kii sajeesh rachane main haath bantaya tha
 The 55-year-old, dressed in a gray loose-fitting sweater, was surrounded by three US officers
 usne 8 farvari se ek hafte tak shanti ke saath adaalat ke saamne 26 / 11 kii sajeesh kii paraten ek-ek kar udhedin
 The Indian government's attempts to extradite Headley came to an end when a US court sentenced him to 35 years in prison for terrorist acts in 2013
 pichley disambar main 26 / 11 ke shadyantrkaari abu jundaal ke khilaaf chal rahe mukademe main uske gavaah banane ke nattejey ke taur par yah video link hi sabase najdiki jariya tha, jisase bharat kii kanoonee vyavastha us tak pahunch sakati thi
 Headley did his job well and quickly weaved the entire thread by adding all the missing threads of a needle-like 26 / 11 plot
 uske bune is lihaaf main faujee afasaron or kattar dehshatgardon ke paband lage the, jinhen pakistan kii chuni hui satta ke upar kabiz asal rahasyamayi satta kii bharat ke khilaaf khatm na hone vaali jang chhedgaye kii ajeebogareeb majaburiyon ne aapas main jod rakhaa tha
 The names he revealed in his testimony & his "handler" Major Iqbal and zaki-ur-rehman Lakhvi's "handler" Brigadier Riaz & he had been mentioned before in the ISI, when in 2010, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) police officers in Chicago i was questioned for a week

 This is the reason why Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam is confident that these statements will strengthen the 26 / 11 trial and the police will be able to further their investigation

 Jundal was an Indian citizen brought from Saudi Arabia in 2011
 usne karachi main lashkar ke control room kii hifaazat kii panaah main chhipakar un do dehshatgardon ko rasta dikhaaya tha, jinhone nariman house par hamalaa kiya tha
 The irony was that Jundal's electronic confrontation with his then partner in crime was now being conducted due to concern over his safety

 The 26 / 11 massacre at the hands of Lashkar was planned in such a way as to "deny it in a credible manner" and no clue could reach the perpetrators of their perpetrators
 yah hamalaa baari hathiyaaron se las 10 aatankiyon ne kiya tha jo hamale main maare gaye, lekin unhone bharat ke sim cardon kaa istemaal kiya or ve aise aaidi card liye hue the, jinamein unki pahchaan hyderabad college ke chaatro ke taur par bataai gai thi
 But thankfully Ajmal Kasab was caught alive on the night of 26 / 11 and by the end of 2009, Headley was also arrested, otherwise the investigation would have ended by going blind
 hedli kii gavaahi main ab iesai ke chaar sevarat afasaron kaa naam aayaa he&brigadier riyaj, major samir ali, leftinent karnal hamaja or major ikbaal
 His testimony has now directly linked the Pakistan Army to the 26 / 11 Mumbai conspiracy
 (bhartiya khufia afasar maanate hai ki iesai ke aadamiyon ne farji naamon kaa istemaal kiya ho saktaa he)
 In Headley's testimony, these officers have been named as handlers or officers who have looked after or worked as middlemen for the ISI and Lashkar
 hedli ke mutabik, lashkar ke harek kartadharta kaa, yahaan tak ki uske supremeo hafiz mohammad said kaa bhi, ek iesai handler tha
 In this way, the denial has now flown away that the Pakistan Army was completely in the dark about the Mumbai attacks
 lashkar ne saaf taur mumbai par hamalaa karne kii thaan rakhi thi
 The plot was hatched in 2006
 yah vah saal tha jab hedli ne apana naam badla tha or apni maarak reki shuru karne ke liye mumbai main daakhil hua tha
 i do not know why, on the head of Lashkar, there was a threat to attack the Taj Mahal Hotel
 2007 main unhone hedli kii reki ke video kaa istemaal karke pakistan ke bheetar hotel kii ek nakal taiyaar kii thi
 He planned to attack a gathering of defense scientists, who were about to convene there
 yah dhada shahar par hamalaa karne par kis kadar amada yah tha, yah tab pataa chalaa jab hedli ne khulaasa kiya ki unhone agast 2008 main inhen 10 dehshatgardon ke gut ko shahar main ghusaane kii do naakaam koshishen kii thim
 Special Public Prosecutor Nikam says, "it is clear that there is a close nexus between the let and the ISI
" ” kitni najdiki he yah sathganth, yah hedli kii aage kii gavaahi se saaf ho gaya
 His testimony suggests that there is tremendous interference and infiltration by the ISI into the let-led Jamaat
 isiilie vahaan brigadier riyaj the, jo lashkar ke military commander jacki-ur-rahamaan ko sambhalate the; major ikbaal the, jo iesai main hedli ke handler the; or ikbaal ke bos leftinent hamaja the
 All these officers are believed to belong to the isi's mysterious "S" branch, which handles the factions of the terrorists and controls the agency's cross-border operations

 His closeness with Pakistan's militant factions began around 2002, when he began collecting information about Lashkar and al Qaeda after the 9 / 11 attacks
 usne lashkar ke paidal sipaahi ke taur prashikshan hasil kiya or yahaan tak ki kashmir main ladgaye jane kii bhi peshkash kii
 But this offer was not accepted due to his age
 jo cheez hedli ko 26 / 11 ke hamalon kaa rojeta stone bana detii he, vah is sajeesh ke bheetar uskaa anokhaa mukaam he
 He has worked with many dazzling characters including ISI, Lashkar and later even Al Qaeda
 vah asli dabl agent tha, jisane 2006 main lashkar ke hukum par apana naam badal liya
 He named his mother's surname in his name, so that he could live secretly as an American businessman in Mumbai and carefully identify the places where he wanted to attack & Taj Mahal Hotel, Nariman Point, Oberoi Hotel

 India's confession of Hedley came at a time when the government had seen the happiness born on December 25 of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Lahore after the terrorist attack on the Air Force base in Pathankot on 2 January
 us hamale main bhartiya sainya balon ke chah jawan maare gaye the or uske baad donon deshon ke bich sachiv str kii baatcheet tal gai thi
 India has linked this conversation to Pakistan's action against the perpetrators of the Pathankot attack
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne kaha, “gend ab pakistan ke paale main he
 Now the immediate issue is what action does Pakistan take on the Pathankot attack and what it does on the given intelligence

 sarkaar ne sanket diya he ki vah hedli ke bayanon ke aadhaar par jaldi hi pakistan ko ek nayaa dogier bhejegi
 Will it really matter, while the many dossiers sent to Pakistan are yet to be seen? Especially because the Pakistani army still continues to dictate and does not think that it is going to stop the machine of terror under its supervision

 Does tattooing benefit, does tattooing increase luck, do tattoos really enhance the beauty of our body, can tattooing increase discomfort, do tattoos affect our minds, do tattoos affect our lives Let's answer yes to all these questions
 ji haa
 
 
 Yes 
 
 tatu kaa hamaare sharir par, man par or jivan par sidhaa asar padataa he, khaskar un tatu kaa jo ki kisi akruti ke rup main hote hai
 That is, if you have created a shape in your body, then its effect is sure to come in your mind, body and behavior
 nahin tikti haath main selary to ravivaar ko karen ye upaayudaharan ke liye aap ne yadi koi dharmik chihn apane sharir par tatu ke rup main banwaaya he jaise maan lijie ki aap ne om yaa swaastik kii akruti tatu ke rup main apane sharir par banavaai he to isse aapako laabh tabhi hoga jab ye akruti sahi tareeke se tatu ke rup main banaai gai ho
 Your mind will be happy, confidence will increase, work will be done, success will be achieved
 lekin yadi tatu banane vaale ne zyada style yaa kuch nayaa karne ke chakkar main om yaa swaastik kii akruti ko vikrut kar diya he to uskaa negative prabhaav aapke man par, sharir par or vyavhaar par aana tay he
 
 
 
 to isliye khaas he surya kaa ratna maanikyasbase pehle prabhaav man par hota he, aapke man main negative soch bad sakati he
 Suddenly you can be in tension
 achaanak aapkaa vyavhaar badalane lag saktaa he

 lekin kuch nayaa banavaane ke chakkar main jin logon ne experiment kiye hai, uchhahen pareshaani zyada hui he
 So be careful while getting tattooed
 ho rahaa he surya kaa raashi parivartankya tatu kaa sambandh jyotish se haiyadi hamaare sharir or man kaa sambandh jyotish se he to sharir or man se judi har cheez jyotish ke daayre main aa jaati he
 Like what color of cloth you have worn in your body
 yadi laal rang kaa pahana he to laal rang mangal grah kaa rang mana jaataa he
 If yellow is worn, then yellow color is considered to be Jupiter
 haraa pahana he to haraa rang budh grah kaa mana jaataa he
 If a gold, silver or copper ring, chain or any jewel is worn then it also has relation with the planets
 sharir main lagaae jane vaale kriim yaa poder kaa sambandh shukr grah se mana jaataa he, sharir kaa koi ang kamjor ho yaa usamen kami ho to use khaas grah se jodakar dekha jaataa he, jaise yadi aankh kamjor he to uskaa sambandh surya grah se mana jaataa he, twachaa kii samasya he to uskaa sambandh budh grah se mana jaataa he

 Therefore, when a figure is formed correctly in the body ie tattoo, it has a favorable effect, but if the shape formed in the form of tattoo is not favorable then it affects the body, mind and behavior
 jiskaa asar hamaare ghar-parivaar, dost, kariyar or samaaj par ho saktaa he
 Life will be protected by the grace of the sun! Take care of these things while getting the tattoo - Whatever shape is made in the form of a tattoo, it should be clear
 - tatu ke jariye jo massej aap dena chaahate hai wo clear ho, aspasht image se bachein
 - Keep in mind what part of the tattoo is being made in the body and how favorable it is to have that shape made in that part - Make a decision on how important it is for you to have a permanent tattoo
 - jis samaaj main aap rahete hai us samaaj ke logon ko dhyaan main rakh kar tatu banavaaen
 First of all, get a tattoo made and see its effect for a few days
 agar aapke jivan main sabakuch acha ho rahaa he to iske baad vahi akruti aap permanent tatu ke rup main banavaa sakate hai
 The history of tattoos, writing a name in any part of the body, making a religious figure, has been a tradition in our country for centuries
 aaj se hajaaron saal pehle log naak, gale, pet yaa haath main kuch likhvaya karte the yaa koi akruti banavaate the, jise alag-alag kshetriy bhashaaon main alag-alag naam se janaa jaataa tha
 In some areas it is still called Godna Godwana

 Get the tattoo done happily, but be careful about the shape formed

 BJP leader and former Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa, while replying to the Congress allegations, said that our mlas will not go anywhere

 On the lines of the Haryana government, now the Uttar Pradesh government is also going to adopt new ways to prevent the ground water level from falling
 haryana sarkaar ne bhu-jal str girane se rokane ke liye jo yojana banaai he usamen dhan ko chhodkar pani kii kam khapat vaali fasalein ugane vaale kisaanon ko sarkaar nakad sahaayta degi
 In lieu of the crop promoting drip and sprinkle irrigation, the government is emphasizing on maize, pulses and oilseeds
 isse ilaake main adhik jal dohan rokane main madad milegi
 Due to excessive water exploitation, 9 districts of Haryana have joined the Dark Zone
 upi sarkaar bhi ab west upi main jal sankat ko dekhte hue sinchai ke liye sprinkal irigation system ko badhaava de rahi he
 The government's efforts have succeeded in irrigating 3 lakh hectares of land with drip irrigation
 iske liye sarkaar kisaanon ko sabsidi bhi uplabdh kara rahi he
 'village water in the village and farm water in the farm', in addition to which information should be given to the crop, farmers are being connected to the m portal of the central government
 jaankaree ke mutabik ab tak 30 lakh kisaan isse jud chuke hai
 Most of them include sugarcane farmers, apart from this, the importance of water is being conveyed to farmers through seminars in villages
 sarkaar 'gaanv kaa pani gaanv main or khet kaa pani khet main' yojana par bhi kaam kar rahi he
 a recent survey conducted by the government has shown that the sugarcane crop does not require as much water as it is given
 ganne ke kheton main pani kii jo barbaadi ho rahi he use rokane kii jarurat he
 The right of farmers to grow sugarcane, in fact, the NITI Aayog has also expressed concern that the water is being wasted through paddy and sugarcane cultivation, but due to the problem it is not enough to mention, they also have to be resolved and This is not an easy task
 west upi main ganna mahaj fasal nahin he, balki yahaan kii raajnneeti or kaarobaar ganna ke ird-gird hi ghumta he
 Even if there is a payment crisis, farmers here consider it their right to grow sugarcane

 His son Munawar Hasan became a member of the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, Assembly and Legislative Council at a very young age

 After the death of Hukum Singh, in the Kairana Lok Sabha by-election in 2018, Tabassum Hasan contested the victory on the ticket of RLD with the support of SP-BSP and represented the Hassan family once again in the Lok Sabha
 is baar chunaav main tabassum hasan sapa ke tikat par kairana loksabhaa seat se chunaav maidan main hai
 The bjp's politics on the Hukum family has been revolving around the Hukum and Hassan families
 70 ke dashak main jab hasar parivaar ke akhtar hasan kaa raajnneetik dabadabaa tha tabhi hukum singh ne sena se tyaagptr dekar vakaalat shuru kar di thi
 Hukum Singh entered politics after advocating for social identity
 hasan parivaar ke dabadabe main siyaasi send lagaate hue hukum singh varsh 1974 main kairana se vidhayak bane or iske baad lagaataar chaar baar is seat par kabja jamaaye rakhaa

 hukum singh ke nidhan ke baad unki beti mriganka singh ne apane pita kii raajnneeti viraasat sanbhali
 In the Lok Sabha by-election held last year, Mriganka Singh lost to rld's Tabassum Hasan in a close contest
 iske baad varsh 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main mriganka singh ko tikat nahin mila
 The BJP is aware of the influence of the Hukum Singh family, which is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi increased his stature by calling Mriganka Singh his younger sister at a rally in Saharanpur
 iske baad yogi adityanath ne bhi saharanpur kii raily main mriganka singh kaa sammaan kar hukum singh kii viraasat ke jariye kairana main bhaajapa ke ummidavaar pradeep choudhary kii raah aasaan karne kii koshish kii

 Despite this, there was a lot of confusion within the Qazi family
 varsh 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle kaaji rashid masood or inke bhattije imran masood main sulah ho chuki he
 Imran Masood is the Congress candidate from Saharanpur Lok Sabha seat and the Qazi family is once again working hard to make its political dominance in the area
 kya haar kaa daag dho paaenge ajitpashchimi upi kii jat or kisaan raajnneeti purv pradhanmantri choudhary charan singh ke irdagird hi gumti he
 This is the reason why BJP, Congress and coalition leaders do not forget to mention Chaudhary Charan Singh at rallies in Western UP
 choudhary charan singh ke putr ajit singh ne apni party ralod ke jariye jat raajnneeti main dabadabaa kaayam kiya
 This dominance was shattered in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when Ajit Singh Baghpat and his son Jayant Chaudhary lost to Mathura
 haar kii kasar varsh 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main badi jeet ke saath mitaane ke liye ajit singh mujffarnagar or jayant choudhary bagpat se maidan main hai

 This will be similar to the experiment conducted in Bihar last year, where Nitish Kumar, along with old rivals Lalu Prasad Yadav and Congress, succeeded in becoming the Chief Minister of the state for the third consecutive time
 isi maheene ghoshit kiye gaye vidhansabha chunaav kaarykram ke tahat uttar pradesh main kul saat charnon main 11, 15, 19, 23, 27 farvari tathaa 4, 8 march ko matdaan hoga, or matganana 11 march ko karwaai jaaegi
 As per the assembly election program announced this month, Uttar Pradesh will have voting on 11, 15, 19, 23, 27 February and 4, 8 March in seven phases, and counting of votes will be done on 11 March
 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne congress par aatankwaad ke prati narmi dikhaane kaa somvaar ko aarope lagaaya or kaha ki centre main bhaajapa ke netritv vaali majboot sarkaar ke kaaran china tathaa pakistan koi dussahas nahin dikhaa pate hai
 He said during election rallies in Rourkela, Angul and Phulbani that the development and national security of the country are two aspects of the same coin for the Narendra Modi government which does not compromise on them
 adityanath ne daawa kiya ki congress ke netritv vaali samprag sarkaar main chini sena aae din ghuspaith karti thi lekin narendra modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad yah khatm ho gaya
 He said that Pakistan was beheading our soldiers along the border during the UPA rule
 ab modi ke pradhanmantri banane ke baad china or pakistan aisa koi dussahas nahin kar sakate
 Adityanath said that during the UPA rule, Pakistan unleashed attacks in India but the Modi government has responded that they will never be able to do anything like this again
 unhone vikaas kii raah main teji se aage badhane main desh kii vifaltaa ke liye congress ko jimmedaar tehraate hue us par aatankwaadiyon or naksaliyon ke prati naram rukh apnaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 Referring to India's response to the Pulwama terror attack, the senior BJP leader said that Pakistan was given a befitting reply after the killing of 40 CRPF personnel when India stormed into Pakistan (in Balakot) and carried out airstrikes on terrorist camps
 unhone kaha ki bharat kii karrwai aatankwaadi shiviron ko tabah karne tak simit nahin thi
 This was a strong step towards breaking the back of Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki bhaajapa kii aatankwaad ke prati kattai bardaasht na karne kii niti he
 Lashing out at the Congress, Adityanath alleged that the country failed to move fast on the path of development due to the old party's soft attitude towards terrorists and Naxalites
 chunaav ayog ke yogi ko 72 ghante tak prachaar se rokane se pehle adityanath odisha main naveen patnayak nit bijd sarkaar par bhi barase or usapar sabhi morchon par sir se pair tak bhrashtachar main duube hone kaa aarope lagaaya
 The BJP leader said that it is ironic that the BJD government does not think of the state

 bihar ke upmukhyamantri susheel kumaar modi ne kaha ki bhaajapa desh main chote rajyon ke gathan ke paksh main he lekin unka aarthik swaavlamban samaapt nahin hona chahie
 On the question of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati dividing this northern state of the country into four parts, Modi told reporters, 'this is an election tactic
 alag rajyon ke prati mayawati sachmuch gambhir hoti to vah paanch varsh ke kaarykaal ke dauraan chaar alag rajya banane kaa prastaav rakhti
 The BJP supports small states but their economic independence should not be affected

 He also suggested the Lokpal to finalize the Bill after hearing from all sides
 notebandi ke 42 din bitne ke saath-saath desh ke 8 gaanvon ko cashles ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he
 This means that these 8 villages do not use cash
 yahaan sabhi vyask logon ke bank khate hai
 Banking is done through SMS and debit cards here and people swipe and get the cards to do all transactions from small to big
 in 8 cashles gaanvon main yadi desh kaa pehla digital gaanv akodera (gujarat) shaamil he to jammu kashmir ke badgam jile kaa lanura or vishakhapatanam kaa dharmasagaram gaanv bhi maujuud he
 Apart from this, Ibrahimpur village in Telangana, Dhasai village in Maharashtra, Basti village in Maner, Bihar and Bind Toli in Kurji and Badjhiri village near Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh
 8 november conotbandilagu hone ke baad desh ke kisi gaanv kii tarah yahaan bhi cash kaa sankat paidaa hua
 If the people of the village were compelled to buy a deal on credit, then the shopkeepers of the village were forced to refuse to lend
 na to gaanv main kisi ke paas cash tha or na hi aasapaas ke kisi bank tak nayaa cash pahunch paaya tha
 Amidst this compulsion, this village took the first step to move towards cashless system and today it has become an example for the whole country
 jaaniye kaise sambhav hua ki uttar bharat se lekar dakshin bharat tak in gaanvon ne cashles banane kii taraf rukh kiya or kyon desh ke kisi shahar se pehle in gaanvon ne khud ko cashles ghoshit kar diya
 1
 mobile-gaanvon ko cashles banane ke liye prayek parivaar main kam se kam ek mobile phone kaa conection jaruri he
 Mobile phones are the most important means of empowering the family
 digital india kaarykram ke tahat desh ke prayek parivaar tak kam se kam ek mobile phone pahunchane ke liye jaruri dhaancha taiyaar kiya ja rahaa he
 It was due to these efforts that Akodara village of Gujarat became the first digital village in the country in 2015 and after demonetisation was implemented, it easily became a cashless village
 2
 Internet-as well as mobile phone access to village-village, Internet facility is also reaching
 internet ke saath mobile phone aapke liye puri tarah se bank kaa kaam karata he
 With internet-enabled mobile, you can contact your bank from home
 vahinkashles tranjactionaki disha main mobile or internet ek saath milakar pehla kadam banate hai
 After the ban on demonetisation, it was possible for the first time to avoid cash shortage for those people who resorted to mobile wallet facility for making payments
 lihaaja, mobile phone or internet suvidha ke saath in gaanvon ne cashles gaanv kii disha main sabase mahatvapurn kadam uthaaya
 3
 bank acount-desh main beete do varshon se jandhan khaaton par vishesh dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 Under this program of the Central Government, efforts are being made to link all those people in the country to the banking system who have remained out of it during the last 60 years
 yah inhen koshishon kaa nateeja rahaa ki notebandi lagu hone ke baad in gaanvon main logon ne apane jandhan athwa anya bank acount ko mobile banking ke liye istemaal kiya
 After connecting their mobile and bank together, where people were ready to do the smallest shopping in the village, the small businessmen of the village also started selling on these mediums taking advantage of these services
 4
 Literacy plays the most important role along with necessary technical development towards becoming a cashless village
 cashles ghoshit kiye gaye gaanvon main padhe-likhe logon ne lagaataar koshish kar zyada se zyada logon or chote-bade dukandaaron ko cash kii dikkat dur karne ke liye takniki kaa sahaara lene ke liye prerit kiya
 It was the result of these efforts that in Dhasai village of Maharashtra, people contacted the bank manager of Mumbai and got sufficient quantity of point of sale machines as soon as possible to give the necessary training to the people and make cashless purchases in the village

 The Delhi High Court upheld the 10-year jail sentence awarded to a man for raping a pregnant woman, saying that the victim's silence cannot be treated as evidence of consenting to have sex

 The High Court held that there is no basis for the defense of the accused that the victim had consented to have sex with him which is proved by his silence about the incident
 chuppi ko yon sambandh banane kii sahmati ke saboot ke taur par nahin mana ja saktaa
 The victim also said that the accused had threatened her
 adaalat ne kaha ki isliye sahmati ke bina yon sambandh bananaa balaatkaar mana jayega
 With this, the High Court upheld the 2015 judgment of the lower court convicting Munna and sentencing him to 10 years in jail
 us samay munna 28 saal kaa tha or usne baar- baar 19 saal kii mahila ke saath balaatkaar kiya
 The High Court also upheld the lower court's decision to acquit Munna in the kidnapping offense, saying there were inconsistencies in the woman's statement of how she reached Delhi
 mahila ne aropiyon par yah aarope lagaaya tha ki aropiyon ne use deh vyapaar ke dhandhe main dhakelne kii koshish kii lekin hai cart ne munna or uske sah- aaropee saathi suman kumaar ko is aarope se bhi bari karne ke faisle ko barkaraar rakhaa
 According to the woman, she had come to Delhi from Uttar Pradesh in December 2010 and met Munna and her partner Kumar who allegedly lured her into getting work
 usne aarope lagaaya ki munna use haryana main panipat le gaya jahaan use kareeb do maheene tak ek flats main band karke rakhaa gaya or baar-baar uske saath balaatkaar kiya gaya
 The woman also alleged that she was threatened that she would kill her if she tried to run away
 baad main munna use noida main kumaar ke flats main lekar gaya or vahaan se ve use dilli ke shastri park main ek anya flats main lekar gaye
 The woman also told the police that on April 1, 2011, when Kumar came to know that Munna had raped her in his absence, there was a fight between the two and Kumar called the police

 He said that his only aim is to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 unhone bhai tejasvi yadav (tejaswi Yadav) or maa rabari devi (rabri Devi) ke saath na rahane ko lekar kaha ki main pehle bhi kahin or rah rahaa tha
 i want to focus on my fight
 unhone kaha ki main kaise jitunga agar ghar par hi baithe rahaa to
 Significantly, Tej Pratap Yadav has been allotted a new bungalow on 7-M strand road
 kuch din pehle hi unhone kaha tha ki bihar sarkaar nae bangale ko lekar die gaye unke aavedan par koi pratikriya nahin de rahi he
 Tej Pratap had applied for the new bungalow a month in advance
 unhone kuch din pehle kaha tha ki nae bangale ko lekar maine bihar sarkaar ke mantri se bhi baat lekin mujhe koi aashwaasan nahin diya gaya
 Let me tell you that in the Lalu family, everything is not going well in the past
 tej pratap dwaara apni patni se talaak lene kii arji ke baad se hi parivaar main unka virodh ho rahaa tha
 The effect of the estrangement going on inside the family was clearly visible even outside
 isaki ek jhalak kuch din pehle vidhansabha satr ke dauraan bhi dikhi
 When Tej Pratap Yadav refrained from meeting his younger brother Tejashwi Yadav and mother Rabri Devi (rabri Devi) during the session
 bihar se baahar rah rahe tejpratap yadav is satr main pehali baar vidhansabha pahunche the
 During this, everyone's eyes remained on them
 vidhansabha satr ke aakhri din or satr main pehali baar pahunche tej pratap yadav sadan sthagit hone par turant hi nikal gaye the
 However, while leaving, Tej Pratap Yadav attacked the Nitish government fiercely
 sadan main bhaag lene pahunche to tej pratap kaa ek alag hi rang dikhaa tha
 Tej Pratap Yadav was seen in dhoti and kurta today
 vah kaale rang kii chappal main the or maathe par you aakaar kaa ek tilak tha
 During this, he also targeted the government because of the ruckus in the House
 jab sadan sthagit hone ke baad tejpratap yadav baahar nikle to patrakaron ne sawaalon ke bauchhaar kar die
 Although Tej Pratap did not answer many questions, but attacking Nitish Kumar, he said that there was a ruckus in Bihar
 madhya pradesh kii rajdhani main ek behad hi chaunkaane vaala maamla saamne aayaa, jisamenshvamritak ke parijanon kii jagah kisi duusare parijan ko de diya gaya, khaas baat yah rahi ki parivaar hi alag nahin rahaa balki donon ke dharm bhi alag-alag hai
 Due to the negligence of Bhopal Memorial Hospital, a Christian man was given to the family whose family also performed the last rites, but upon reaching the Christian family hospital, the hospital's negligence was exposed
 maamla saamne aane ke baadpulisthane main der raat tak gahamagahami bani rahi or mar chuke vyakti kii asthiyaan apane sahi vaaris ke haath me jane ke intjaar main thane main hi padi rahi
 According to police, Kunjuman, a resident of Govind Garden, Bhopal, died of heart attack on October 27, whose body was kept in a hospital morgue
 usee din khusheelaal naam ke or shaks kaa shav aspataal ke murdaghar laayaa gaya
 Kunjuman's family wanted to cremate the dead body on October 30 as their relatives live in Kerala, which would have been the last rituals only
 is dauraan khusheelaal ke bete aspataal pahunchate hai or shav lekar apane ghar chale jate hai or shav kaa hindu reeti rivaaj ke mutabik antim sanskaar kar dete hai
 Till now everything seemed fine, but the twist in the story came when Kunjuman's family reached the hospital on Monday to take the body
 aspataal pahunchane par unhone dekha ki murdaghar main rakhi laash kunjuman kii nahin balki kisi or kii he
 When inquired in the hospital after the revelation on the demand of the second body, it was found that a Hindu family had taken the dead body of Kunjuman who lives in Bagmugaliya
 iske baad kunjuman ke parijan jab bagamugalia pahunche to paaya ki kunjuman ke shav kaa hindu reeti rivaajon ke tahat antim sanskaar kar diya gaya
 After this, the matter reached the police station and Pulis took the body of Kunjuman as the body of his father and called the sons who had cremated him, but not alone but with Kunjuman's ashes
 ji haa, bhopal ke nishatpura thane main der raat kunjuman kii asthiyon ne hajiri di
 Khushi Lal's son Prem Narayan and his brother reached the Nishatpura police station in Bhopal late night with the ashes
 inaki maane to galati aspataal kii he jisane khusheelaal kii jagah kunjuman kaa shav inhen saunp diya
 However, questions are arising because according to Hindu beliefs, the body is performed before the last rites, in which many of the bodies face many times, why the son could not recognize the body of his father
 police ne kiya maamla darjpulice ke saamne jab yah maamla aayaa to jaanch ke baad uchit dhaaraon main maamla darj kiya gaya
 CSP Lokesh Kumar said that a case has been registered under Section 297 of the IPC and the ashes have been called to the police station so that the Christian family can at least carry the bones and complete their rituals
 udhar, der raat maamle main nayaa pench aa gaya
 According to Kunjuman's brother, according to his religion, the whole body is buried, not the bones
 aise main parivaar ye tay nahin kar paa rahaa he ki asthiyon ko saath le jaaen yaa thane chhod jaaen
 Team India had declared on 601 / 5 First innings South Africa all out for 275 in the first innings, India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has said that the decision of whether the team will follow South Africa depends on the captain Virat Kohli
 
 aswin ke mutabik captain yah jarur dekhegaa ki uske gendbaaj puri tarah ricover kar chuke hai yaa nahin

 The captain will decide what we should do

 Ashwin also praised wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha who played a powerful game behind the wicket
 saaha ne umesh yadav kii gend par theunis di bruin kaa shandaar kaich pakadaa
 Ashwin said, 'there is no need to make any headway in believing that Saha is currently one of the wicketkeepers
 maine aaj unhen shaayad hi koi gend chhodte hue dekha ho chaahe wo kyon na raf par padi ho
 It shows how good a wicketkeeper he is
 unke paas dhairya bhi he
 You cannot deny his role even with the bat
 'aswin ne kaha ki yah pich kaaphi had tak vishakhapatnam jaisi he
 Ashwin said, 'usually the scorecard tells you the story and the problem with this South African team is that their batting is up to number-11

 vinod khanna kaa guuruuvaar ko nidhan ho gaya
 He was 70 years old
 pichley kuch dinon se ve cancer se jujh rahe the
 Recently, a photo of him went viral in which he looked quite unwell
 vinod khanna ne 'mere apane', 'qurbaani', 'purab or pashchim', 'reshma or shera', 'haath kii safai', 'hera pheri', 'mukaddar kaa sikandar' jaisi kai shandaar filmein kii hai
 The name Vinod Khannaka was one of the actors who started off as a villain but later became a hero
 vinod khanna ne 1971 main solo lead role main film 'ham tum or wo' main kaam kiya tha
 His father Kishan Chand Khanna was annoyed when Vinod Khanna signed Sunil Dutt's home production film Mana Ka Meet in 1968 when his father was angry at signing the first film
 tab unka textile bijness bombai se peshawar tak failaa tha
 Having read and written to Vinod Khanna, he had hoped that he would grow up and take care of the family business
 lekin vinod to filmon main aa gaye
 Then the father had given an indefinite time that if you want to do films then go, you have 2 years of deferment
 agar vahaan acha nahin kar paae, to tumhen family bijness sanbhaalanaa hoga
 Khanna's family was shattered in Partition When the two parts of the country broke up after independence, the Tokhanna family left Mumbai to leave their business of frozen textiles in Peshawar
 vinod khanna kii shuruaati padhai likhaai mumbai ke saint mairi or saint jevirs hai skool main hui
 After this, in 1957, the Khanna family moved to Delhi for better business
 teen saal tak vinod khanna yaheen rahe
 Then in 1960 the family moved back to Mumbai, but in order to write better studies, they were sent to Barnes School in Devlali near Mumbai
 yahaan vinod khanna 12veen class tak skool ke boostal main rahe
 But back to college to go back to Mumbai, the youngsters had changed their dreams with a saddle and beautiful complexion
 mughal-e-ajam se laga acting kaa shaukaacting kaa shauk unhen boarding skool ke dinon main mughal-e-ajam or solvaan saal jaisi filmein dekhne ke baad laga tha
 After that when i came to Sydenham College in Mumbai, the dream was to become an engineer by studying and writing
 lekin us dauraan khubasurat rang rup ke saath naatakon main shaukia adaakaari unhen nae rup main mashhoor kar rahi thi
 Meanwhile, some friends of Vinod Khannaki encouraged him to try his hand at films
 tab vinod ko bhi laga tha ki mumbai jaise shahar se aankh-michauli kaa rishta ab tak isi sapane ke liye kaayam he
 The first film flopped, yet Vinod Khanna appeared in films with the look of The rajesh-amitabh collision, while the failure of the first film was also noticed
 oonchi kad-lathi or mohak andaaj ne nirmaataaon kaa dhyaan khinchaa
 Due to the style of movies, fan clubs were also formed
 us daur main rajesh khanna jaise star ke baad agar sabase zyada fain folowing agar kisi kii thi to wo vinod khanna the
 After the popularity of Rajesh Khanna among the young boys and girls of that era, it was the turn of Vinod Khanna
 usee lokapriyata kii vajah se manmohan desai jaise film diarector ne unhen amitabh jaise star ke saamne khadaa karne kaa hausala kiya
 This was the period of 1974-75 when everyone's star had blown away in front of Amitabh
 us daur main vinod khanna ke saamne cinema kii duniya main ban rahane ke raste bas do hi bache the- amitabh se muqabla yaa phir cinema kii duniya se palaayan
 Vinod Khanna did both of these
 amitabh se datakar muqabla bhi or uske baad achaanak cinema ke parade se dur palaayan bhi
 Shahrukh Khan is in a lot of discussion these days about his talk show Ted Talk India
 star plus par aane vaale is sho main kai jane-maane log apane jivan ke anubhav share kar chuke hai
 Recently, during the shooting of this show, Shahrukh Khan also planned his fourth child
 chauthe bachche kaa naam shahrukh rakhenge akankshadarasal, shahrukh 'tiidi tox- india nai soch nai' ke ek episod kii shooting kar rahe the
 During the show, he had to speak 'akanksha' which he was getting stuck in due to which he also gave many retakes
 jiske baad shahrukh khan ne majaak main kaha ki, 'mujhe is naam ko bolne main kai baar ritek lene pade, yah sharmnaak he
 i think i should do a fourth child soon, whose name i will name
 ' bataa den shahrukh khan apane bacchon ke saath aksar soshal media par tasviren post karte hai
 Shah Rukh became very emotional while referring to his mother during his photoshoot with his mother's fans
 unhone sho ke dauraan apni maa kii photo bhi darshakon ko dikhaai
 The special thing is that Shahrukh's mother appeared wearing a sari in this photo
 vahiin shahrukh ne bhi sho main kaha ki 'meri maa kii sari main keval yaheen photo he'
 Let me tell you that in the show 'TED Talks- India Nayi Soch Nayi', Shah Rukh advises people to share new ideas, not just love
 ye sho soshal coj se judaa hua he
 This work has neither been independently confirmed nor other scientists have reviewed it, but if it is proved, then it will definitely cross the limits of medicine and morality
 afghanistan kii khufia agency ne shuukravaar ko kaha ki usne 7,800 kilogram visphotak se bhare trek bam visphot kii ek badi sajeesh naakaam kar di
 The Directorate General of National Security (NDS) said that the Pakistan-based Haqqani network and the Taliban leadership planned the attack
 baharhaal, endies ne sajeesh kaa koi thos pramaan muhaiyaa nahin karaayaa
 The comments khufia agency ke pravaktaa shafikulla tahiri ne kaha ki mangalvaar ko visphotak paaya gaya jo rajdhani ke purvi chor par ek trek main cement boron main chhipaakar rakhe gaye the
 "based on the NDS investigation, these explosives would have destroyed everything falling within the radius of 15 square meters," Tahiri told reporters
 ’’ unhone bataaya ki mangalvaar raat ko endies ke chaape main paanch sandigdh sajeeshkarta golibari main maare gaye
 Two others were arrested
 rashtriya suraksha mahanideshaalay (endies) ne kaha ki pakistan sthit hakkaani network or taliban netritv ne hamalaa kii yojana banaai
 The NDS, however, did not provide any concrete evidence of the conspiracy
 tippaniyan Intelligence agency spokesman Shafiqullah Tahiri said explosives were found on Tuesday that were hidden in cement sacks in a truck at the eastern end of the capital
 tahiri ne samvaadadaataaon se kaha, ‘‘endies kii jaanch ke aadhaar par ye visphotak 15 varg meter ke daayre main aane vaale har cheez ko nasht kar die hote

 kya arvind kejariwal ko sarkaar girane kaa dar lag rahaa he? yaa phir wo dabaav kii raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 It is not clear but they have said something on which the politics of politics is set once again
 arvind kejariwal ne ashanka jataai he ki congress or bijepi milakar unki sarkaar gira sakate hai
 They have only 48 hours, so they are working accordingly
 darasal, aaj jab kejariwal se tabiyat se judaa sawaal kiya gaya to unhone kaha, 'tabiyat kaa kya he? wo to thik or kharaab hoti rahati he
 We have 48 hours because the manipulation going on between BJP and Congress does not know how long the government will run
 isliye hamaari koshish he ki 48 ghante ke andar janata kaa jitna kaam ho saktaa he ham kara den
 The Congress has completely rejected Kejriwal's statement
 congress netaa shakeel ahamed kaa kahana he ki congress aage bhi aam aadmi party kaa samarthan karegi
 i do not know why he is making such statements
 is bich, arvind kejariwal ne yah bhi saaf kar diya he ki dilli vidhansabha adhyaksh pad ke liye em es dheer AAP ke ummidavaar honge
 Politics has intensified regarding the post of Assembly speaker
 It seems that the phase of fire test of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has started
 congress main samarthan ko lekar virodh main uthe sur se pehle hi ye shubahaa ho chukaa he ki kya kejariwal bina kisi aadchan ke bahumat sabit kar paaenge
 If they cross this hurdle, then on the next step, they can find themselves in trouble and this halt will be for the election of the Speaker
 bijepi ke jagadish mukhi ko alji ne pro tem spikar banane kaa faisla kiya tha or wo sabhi sadasyon ko shapath dilaate
 But the BJP decided strongly that Mukhi or no BJP MLA would become a pro tem speaker
 asal main kisi party kaa bahumat naa hone kii vajah se bijepi kii ummiden paravaan chadhi hai
 Had Mukhi become a pro tem speaker, he would have lost one vote in the Assembly Speaker election
 party aisa jokhim nahin lenaa chaahati
 The BJP has 32 mlas and may get the support of an Independent
 aap ke 28 vidhayak he
 Shoaib of JDU has supported AAP
 aise main spikar chunaav main congress ke 8 sadasyon kaa role ahm ho jaataa he
 What happens if the speaker belongs to another party except AAP? Of course, the post of the speaker is beyond the politics of the parties but there will be more chances of getting pulled in the assembly
 vipaksh kii aawaaj bhi mukhar tareeke se uth sakati he
 Now it will have to be seen which party's crown is the head of the speaker

 Anna Hazare has again written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying that there is doubt that the Lokpal Bill will be passed by 23 December
 23 disambar ko sansad kaa sheet satr khatm ho rahaa he
 He has warned that if the bill is not passed, he will start his proposed fast and 'jail Bharo' movement
 chaar pannon ke patr main unhone aarope lagaaya ki sarkaar kaa vyavhaar ‘bilkul thik nahin’ he or poocha ki singh ne likhit aashwaasan dene ke baavjood naagarik adhikaar patr (citigens charter) par apana rukh kyon badal diya
 He had assured that the Citizen's Charter would be part of the Lokpal Bill
 unhone kaha ki pichley kuch maheene se singh patron ke madhyam se unhen aashwaasan dete rahe ki sansad ke sheetakaaleen satr main majboot lokapal vidheyak paarit kiya jayega
 Hazare said that in the last one year the government gave a lot of assurances on the Lokpal Bill, but every time he tricked the people of the country
 unhone kaha ki aapaki baton ko dhyaan main rakhte hue hamane sheet satr tak apane sabhi andolan sthagit kar diye
 According to media reports, the winter session will end on December 23
 kya tab tak lokapal vidheyak paarit ho jayega, hamen is par andeh he
 Hazare wrote in the letter that despite your promises, if a strong, independent and effective bill is not passed in this session of Parliament, from December 27, i will be forced to sit on hunger strike
 jail baro andolan 30 disambar se shuru hoga
 Seeking to bring the anti-corruption Branch of the CBI under the Lokpal, he said that no government seems to want to relinquish control over the CBI for political reasons

 He said that according to the Assam Accord in 1985, anyone who entered the state after March 24, 1971, is considered an illegal citizen
 enarasi main naam darj karaane ke liye aavedakon par daayitv tha ki ve saboot uplabdh karaaen
 But the real citizens who could not keep their documents safe due to poor, backward or natural outbreak, their names have been kept in the NRC
 unhone kaha ki enarasi main shaamil na ho sakane waalon main se adhiktar aise log hai, jinke dastavezon main maamuli trutiyaan thim
 The government should look into the complaints about NRC officials, who show favoritism and discrimination against the particular linguistic community
 unhone kaha ki aisi bhi shikaayatein mili hai ki un adhikariyon ne prayaapt dastauez pesh karne ke baavjood unhen radd karne kaa ravaiya apanaaya
 The comments moulana umari ne kahana he ki jinke naam enarasi suchi main darj hone se rah gaye hai unhen aavashyak dastauez uplabdh karaane, visangatiyon ko dur karne or prakriyaaon or aupchaarikta ko puraa karne ke liye paryaapt samay or avasar dena sarkaar kaa kaam he
 Anomalies have also been found in the NRC list that the child is named but not the name of the parent
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar kii duusari zimmedaari yah he ki vah kaanoon or vyavastha par paini nigaah rakhe or enarasi suchi ko mudda banaakar or alpsankhyak samudaay ko videshi, ghuspaithiye or aatankwaadi bataakar unke khilaaf bade paimaane par hinsa or danga karne se asaamaajik tatwon ko roke
 The role of some media persons has also been uncooperative, as they have started a virtual hatred campaign against 4 million people, helping the hateful agenda of communal and fascist forces in the country

 When Gadkari brought him back to the party and made him a working committee member and UP convenor, Modi did not go to the election campaign
 aakhir 24 may 2012 ko unhone joshi ko kaarysmiti se hataane ke liye party ko majaboor kar diya
 The latest issue is the poster controversy
 jis tarah se joshi ko badhai dene waalon par karrwai hui usase saaf he ki modi ke netritv main bijepi kii mukhya dhara main joshi kii vaapasi naammumkin he
 After all, is hostility or fear the reason for this action? Joshi supporters are calling it a double standard
 unka kahana he ki modi 'sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas' kii baat karte hai, lekin joshi ke saath aisa bartaav kyon? samarthakon kaa kahana he ki joshi ke maamle main shah nimitt maatr hai or asli khel modi kii ore se ho rahaa he
 Sources claim that there is contact between Shah and Joshi, but BJP leaders dismiss it outright
 joshi samarthak sawaal uthaate hai ki jin mulaayam singh ne karsevakon par goli chalavaai unke ghar shaadi samaaroh main modi khud jate hai
 Lalu Yadav who stopped Advani's chariot journey also goes to Modi there
 jin sharad pavaar ne sangh ko aatanki sanghathan kaha, unke saath baraamati main manch saajha karte hai, mufti mohammad said se atmiyata se gale milte hai, lekin joshi se parhez kyon? haalanki bijepi ke rashtriya sachiv shyaam jaju kehete hai, "saradaare sanghathan kii prakriya se shripad nik ke sahaayak nahin bane the, isliye isamen sanghathan kii koi bhoomika nahin he
 "why is the Sangh silent, why is the Sangh who is playing the role of a patron in the Mahabharata happening on Sanjay? Why is the Sangh worker camp organized in Ahmedabad in January when Joshi was also invited
 lekin sutron kaa kahana he ki joshi ko baithak main aane se rokane ke liye bijepi ke sheersh netritv ne khud rajya ke sangh ke padaadhikariyon se sampark saadhaa tha
 Manmohan Vaidya, the All India publicity head of the Sangh, tells India Today, “joshi has always been a part of the Sangh and the Sangh is like a home for him
 " lekin bijepi main ahm bhoomika nibhaa chuke sangh ke ek purv prachaarak sangh kii khamoshi par kehete hai, "sangh hameshaa party kii satta aane ke baad satta ke saath khadaa ho jaataa he or swayan itnaa lipt ho jaataa he ki usamen samaadhaan kii kshamta nahin rah jaati
 "on the poster controversy, he believes that some people should understand that in politics, no one should be left with just injuries
 lekin shyaam jaju joshi kii jimmedaari ko sangh kaa masalaa maanate hai
 While Vaidya says, "modi-joshi is not a pracharak, but now only a volunteer and the party should be asked about Joshi's responsibility or the poster dispute
" "modi-shah jodi ke sheersh par hone ke baavjood party ke andar, or baahar bhi, in donon ko asahaj karne kaa joshi kaa madda unke vyaktitv kii guruta bayaan kar detaa he
 In fact, Tharoor said during a program on Sunday that no good Hindu would want a religious temple to be demolished and built into a Ram temple
 bayaan par hangaamaa khadey hone ke baad tharur ne twit kiya, ''mere bayaan ko galat tareeke se pesh kiya gaya
 i just said that many Hindus want a temple there because it is the birthplace of Shri Ram
 lekin ek acha hindu nahin chahega ki aisi jagah mandir bane jahaan kisi or ke dharmik sthal ko giraaya gaya ho
 The comments unhone yah bhi kaha, ''yah meraa vyaktigat bayaan tha, main apni party kaa pravaktaa nahin hum isliye mere bayaan ko party se naa joden
 '' unhone yah bhi kaha, ''yah meraa vyaktigat bayaan tha, main apni party kaa pravaktaa nahin hum isliye mere bayaan ko party se naa joden

 unhone ye bhi kaha ki match ke dauraan wo ek baar nervas bhi mahasoos kar rahi thim, lekin unhone khud ko ye kahkar hausala dilaayaa ki iske liye unhone kadi mehnat kii he
 Manipur's El Sarita Devi (60 kg) was sentenced to a year-long ban for mischaracterizing emotion during the Incheon Asian Games
 2014 ke inchiyan khelon ke baad wo pehali baar aise muqaabale main hissaa le rahi thim
 The comments toornament main kaamanwealth khelon kii kaansya padak vijeta pinki jangada (51 kilogram varg) bhi china kii chaing yuan se 0-3 se haar gayi
 While Vikas Krishna (75 kg) defeated Zhao Mingan 3–0 in the men's section
 shiva thapa (52 kilogram) or el devendo singh (49 kilogram) ko bhi haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Manish Kaushik (60 kg), Amritpreet Singh (91 kg) and Narendra (+91 kg) won on the last day of the tournament
 lekin sarita devi kahati hai ki is toornament se sabase badi sakaaratmak baat ye hui ki bhartiya mukkebaazo ko vahiin training kaa mauqaa mil gaya jahaan agle saal march main bhartiya mukkebaazon ko asian olympic qualifaayar main hissaa lenaa he
 In the 13-member Indian team, 10 male and 3 female boxers participated
 bacchon ke saath thode dinon ke aaraam ke baad sarita devi phir se training camp main kadaa abhyaas kar rio kaa tikat hasil karne kaa iraadaa rakhti hai
 She also said that she once felt nervous during the match, but she encouraged herself by saying that she worked hard for this
 manipur kii el sarita devi (60 kilogram) ko inchiyan asian khelon ke dauraan bhaavana main bahakar galat tareeke se virodh jataane kii vajah se saal bhar ke bain kii sazaa sunai gai thi

 vijyapti ke anusaar, yah aashcharya kii baat he ki bhartiya media kaa kuch tabaka mudies analytics jo keval ek data or vishleshan company he tathaa mudies invester sarvice jo reating seva detii he, ke bich antar karne main vifal rahaa
 It added that it is also surprising that no investigation was conducted and readers were not told about the difference between Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investment Service
 vijyapti ke mutabik mudies analytics ke karmchaaree kanishtha associat arthshaastri kii raay ko is rup main prastut kiya gaya maano vah mudies analytics kii raay he
 It said, the government has noted with great grief that the media has presented the personal opinion of a junior analyst as if it were the views of the v rating agency
 media jis rup se use prastut karnaa chahta tha, us baat ko us aadhaar par pesh kiya
 According to the release, the opinion of the junior associate economist, an employee of Moody's Analytics, was presented as if it were the opinion of Moody's Analytics
 isamen kaha gaya he, sarkaar ne bade du:kha ke saath yah gaur kiya he ki media ne ek kanishtha vishleshak kii vyaktigat raay ko is rup main prastut kiya gaya maano ve reating agency ke vichaar hai
 The media presented it on the basis of what it wanted to present
 dilli hoicourt ne pichley saal 16 disambar ko hue samuhik balaatkaar maamle kii rojaanaa sunwaayee cover karne kii aaj media ko manjuuri de di
 Till now the matter was being heard in a closed room
 twarit adaalat kii adhyakshata kar rahe atirikt satr nyaayadhish ne 22 janvari ko media ko sunwaayee kii kawarez karne se rokane kaa aadesh diya tha, jise hoicourt ne darkinar kar diya
 Justice Rajeev Shakadhar said, "the court will allow one representative journalist from each recognized national daily newspaper to be present during the hearing of the case
" hoicourt se manyata praapt patrakaron ke ek samooh kii yachika sweekaar karte hue nyaayadhish ne kaha, pitiai or yuanai tathaa anya rashtriya dainik samachar patron ke reporter apni khabar ko anya samachaarpatron ke pratinidhiyon or electronic media ke sadasyon se saajha karenge
 However, the court has ordered the media not to reveal the name of the victim and any family members
 adaalat ne kaha, khabar main peedita yaa uske parivaar ke kisi sadsy yaa shikayatakarta yaa kaarywahi main shaamil gavaahon ke naam ujagar nahin kiye jaaenge
 The court said, the portion of the Sessions Court directing not to be included in the news, that part will not be included in the news
 hoicourt ne ummid jataai ki media apni reporting ko keval samachar tak hi simit rakhega or satr nyaayalay ke kaaryakshetra main kisi prakaar kaa dakhal nahin degaa
 The court said, it is expected that reporting will be limited to news only
 media adaalat ke kaaryakshetra main dakhal nahin degaa
 It is a very thin but clear and sure line, which, if respected, would be a good sign for institutional integrity
 23 varshiya ek ladki kaa gat 16 disambar ko dakshin dilli kii ek chalati bas main samuhik balaatkaar kiya gaya tha
 He died in Singapore on 29 December
 hoicourt ne dilli police dwaara 5 janvari ko jari paraamarsh ko bhi darkinar kar diya, jisamen kaha gaya tha ki nichali adaalat ne pehle hi aarope patr kaa sangyaan le liya he isliye maamle kii kaarywahi kii reporting nahin kii ja sakati
 The Delhi Police, opposing the plea of the journalists, had told the High Court that the investigation and hearing of each rape case should be done in front of the camera
 dilli police ne daleel di thi ‘‘ media kaa khabar dene kaa adhikaar nirankush nahin he
 The media cannot claim to be a litigant in the case and the legal provisions will apply only to the accused or the victim as they are the essential parties of the case
 patrakaron ne apni yachika main daleel di thi ki sabhi maamalon ko cover karnaa media kaa kartavya he
 It is part of the democratic system and in an independent society it is not right to stop the media from covering hearings
 patrakaron ne maamle kii saarvajanik sunwaayee kii maang kii thi
 He had said that the reporting of gang rape case has helped the society and due to good coverage of the case, two major courts of the country had taken suo motu cognizance of the case
 tippaniyan Referring to some documents and a television interview of the victim's friend and sole witness to the incident, the lawyer for the journalists said that although the victim's family had revealed her name and other information, the media did not reveal the victim's name 
 ek magistriti adaalat ne 7 janvari ko maamle kii band kamare main sunwaayee kaa aadesh diya tha, jise twarit adaalat ne bhi barkaraar rakhaa tha
 On January 22, the Additional Sessions Judge presiding over the fast court ordered the media to stop the hearing, which was turned down by the High Court
 nyaayamurti rajeev shakdhar ne kaha, adaalat manyata praapt prayek rashtriya dainik samachaarpatr ke ek pratinidhi patrkaar ko maamle kii sunwaayee ke dauraan maujuud rahane kii anumati degi
 Accepting the petition of a group of High Court-accredited journalists, the judge said, "reporters of PTI and UNI and other national dailies will share their news with representatives of other newspapers and members of electronic media
 haalanki adaalat ne media ko peedita or parivaar ke kisi bhi sadsy kaa naam ujagar nahin karne kaa aadesh diya he
 The court said, the names of the victim or any of her family members or complainants or witnesses involved in the proceedings will not be revealed in the news
 adaalat ne kaha, satr nyaayalay kaarywahi ke jis hisse ko khabar main shaamil na karne kaa nirdesh de, us hisse ko khabar main shaamil nahin kiya jayega
 The High Court hoped that the media would restrict its reporting to news only and would not interfere in the jurisdiction of the Sessions Court
 adaalat ne kaha, yah ummid kii jaati he ki reporting keval samaacharon tak hi simit rahegi
 The media will not interfere in the court's jurisdiction
 yah bahut patali lekin spasht evam sunishchit rekha he, jiskaa yadi sammaan kiya gaya to yah sansthagat akhandta ke liye shubh sanket honge
 On December 16, a 23-year-old girl was gang-raped in a moving bus in South Delhi
 uskaa 29 disambar ko singapore main nidhan ho gaya tha
 The High Court also set aside the consultation issued by the Delhi Police on 5 January, stating that the trial court has already taken cognizance of the charge sheet and hence the proceedings of the case cannot be reported
 dilli police ne patrakaron kii yachika kaa virodh karte hue hoicourt se kaha tha ki balaatkaar ke prayek maamle kii jaanch or sunwaayee camere ke saamne honi chahie
 The Delhi Police argued that "the media's right to report is not arbitrary
" media is maamle main ek vaadi hone kaa daawa nahin kar saktaa or kanoonee praavdhaan keval aaropee yaa peedita par hi lagu honge kyonki ve maamle ke aavashyak paksh hai
 Journalists had argued in their petition that it is the duty of the media to cover all cases
 yah loktantric pranali kaa hissaa he or swatantra samaaj main media ko sunwaayee cover karne se rokna sahi nahin he
 Journalists had demanded a public hearing of the case
 unhone kaha tha ki samuhik balaatkaar maamle kii reporting ne samaaj kii madad kii he or is maamle kii acchhee kawarejj milane se desh kii do badi adaalaton ne is maamle kaa swat: sangyaan liya tha
 The comments patrakaron ke vakil ne kuch dastavezon or peedita ke mitra evam haadase ke ekmaatr gavaah ke television par die saakshaatkaar kaa zikr karte hue kaha ki haalanki peedita ke parijanon ne uskaa naam evam anya jaankaree kaa khulaasa kiya tha, lekin media ne peedita kaa naam ujagar nahin kiya
 a magisterial court ordered a closed-door hearing of the case on 7 January, which was upheld by the fast court
