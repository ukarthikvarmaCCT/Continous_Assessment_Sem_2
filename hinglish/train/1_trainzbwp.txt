 vahiin saurav ganguli ne ravi shastri dwaara uthaae ja rahe kisi bhi sawaal par jawaab dene se pehle hi manaa kar diya he
 Ganguly, the former captain of Team India and a member of the advisory committee, had a clear answer to this, 'let Ravi Shastri have to say
 mujhe us par kuch nahin kahana he
 Ganguly said that the coach selection process is confidential and i would not like to say anything on this! khabaren ain ki saurav ganguli ko us din anya kaaryakramon kaa hissaa hona tha, jisaki jaankaree pehle se hi salaahkaar samiti ko de di gai thi

 kuch sutron kaa yah bhi kahana he ki ganguli maanate hai ki shastri bhartiya cricket main unke yogadan kaa puraa sammaan nahin karte
 Shastri never respected the team he (ganguly) created and took India to the top
 bataaya jaataa he ki isse bhi ganguli naaraaz hai
 At the same time some parties believe that this is just Ravi Shastri's former BCCI President N

 Pakistan has been silent on the attack on Amarnath pilgrims
 aatanki sanghathan lashkar-e taiyaba ne bhi ab tak hamale kii zimmedaari nahin lee he
 But the plot of the conspiracy of the attack appears to be firmly connected to Pakistan
 darasal, ek haftaa pehle hi pakistan main baithe aatank ke aakaa hafiz said ke saale abdul rahamaan makki ne ek dhamkee di thi
 Pakistan's Bahawalpur Serahman Makkien had warned to commemorate the anniversary of terrorist Burhan Wani and a terrorist attack in India during this period
 makki ne pradhanmantri narendra modi ke isroyal daure kaa bhi apane bayaan main zikr kiya tha
 'modi is punished for visiting Israel', Rahman Makki had even talked about breaking his hate speech in India
 itnaa hi nahin usne apane sandesh main ye bhi kaha tha modi ke isroyal daure kaa badla lenaa he
 In fact, after India's independence, no Prime Minister of the country has visited Israel
 piem modi ke isroyal daure ko pakistan bahut hi paini najar se watch kar rahaa tha
 Pakistani media was also constantly running news about Modi's visit
 vahaan kii media main isroyal se majboot hote bharat ke rishton par chintaa jaahir kii thi
 Discussions have been seen in Pakistan regarding defense deals between India and Israel
 kuch visheshgyon ne yahaan tak kaha ki bharat-isroyal ke beej badhata raksha sahyog dakshin asian kshetra main samrik santulan bigaadega
 Actually, the question is not only this, Pakistan's concern is further from this
 bharat lagaataar apane ladaaku hathiyaaron main ijapha kar rahaa he
 In Kashmir, the Indian army and security forces are waging operations against the terrorists
 aise main seemaa par bharat se munhtod jawaab milane se pakistan baukhalaayaa he
 Rather, the militants of the Pakistan Army's militants are also worried about India's growing strength
 isliye aisa mana ja rahaa he ki piem modi or isroyal ke bich bad rahi dosti se hataash aatank ke aakaaon nimarnath yatriyonko nishaanaa banaaya
 At the same time, the hateful statement of Rahman Makki is even more important because since the arrest of Hafiz Saeed, Rahman Makki has been watching the terrorist activities of lashkar-e-taiba and Jamaat-ud Dawa

 '6
 adaalat ne kaha, ‘aap hotalon, mal, vanijyik parisaron, township kaa nirmaan kar rahe hai jisatak aam aadmi kii pahunch nahin he

" bhoomi ke istemaal main badlaav ke liye kaise alag-alag adhisuchanaaen ain

 Questions are being raised about the steps that the Election Commission has tied
 2014 main bihar main chah charnon main chunaav hue the
 There will be 7 phases in 2019
 ek shantipurna rajya main saat charnon main chunaav kaa kya matlab he
 In 2014, Jhanjharpur, Madhubani, Darbhanga were placed in the fourth phase along with Madhepura, Samastipur, Begusarai and Khagaria
 jhanjharpur, madhubani or darbhanga ek duusare se sata hua he
 This time these three neighboring districts have been kept in different stages
 jhanjharpur main matdaan tisare charan main yani 23 april ko hoga
 Polling in Darbhanga is on April 29
 madhubani main paanchaven charan main 6 may ko hoga
 Only the Election Commission can explain why the distribution of the three neighboring districts has been kept at different stages
 kisi kii sahuuliyat kaa dhyaan rakhkar kiya gaya he yaa phir ayog ne apni sahuuliyat dekhi he
 Similarly, questions are being raised about the elections in Maharashtra in 4 phases
 yogendra yadav ne sawaal kiya he ki 2014 main urisa main do charnon main chunaav hue the
 This time there will be four stages
 pashchim bengal main 5 kii jagah 7 charnon main chunaav honge
 Not only this, the announcement of elections has also been delayed by 5 days
 2014 main 5 march ko chunaavon kaa elaan ho gaya tha
 To understand election management through these dates, it is important to ask these questions
 yah vahi chunaav ayog he jisane pichley vidhansabha main press conference ke liye sandesh bhijwa kar waapas le liya tha
 It was found that in the meantime the Prime Minister has gone to rally
 kahin aisa to nahin ki is baar 100 sabhaaon ko samaapt kar unke dilli laut aane kaa intazaar ho rahaa tha!jo bhi he, ab aapke paas janata banane kaa mauqaa aayaa he
 Think like the public
 news channelon ne survey main bataanaa shuru kar diya he ki naukari mudda he
 These channels did nothing on the question of jobs themselves
 phir bhi aap in channelon se sampark karen ki agar naukari mudda he to isaki vyavastha ke sawaalon ko bhi dikhaanaa shuru kar dijie
 i am sure they do not want the face of the job question
 sankhya chahie
 So that they can tell that such a percentage of people consider the job to be an issue and such a percentage does not consider the job as an issue
 bihar main es es si stenegrapher 2017 kii pariksha nikali thi
 On 28 November 2018, 2400 students were successful

 His result could not come again

 Last year, the Panchayati Department of the state government in Assam took out 945 vacancies
 20 may 2018 ko pariksha hui thi
 This examination got caught in many investigations and cases
 siaidi jaanch hui or gadabadiyaan saamne ain
 Even after this, the government removed the result on 5 March 2019
 chaatro ne sainkadon mail bhejkar aarope lagaae hai ki paise dekar siten bechi gai hai
 People of political connections have got jobs
 ab ye channel in parikshaon ko lekar sawaal to karenge nahin
 It is in Congress governments as well as in BJP governments
 rojgaar ke mudde ko survey ke pratishat se gaayab kar diya gaya he
 Now it is up to the youth what they get for themselves through the debates of these channels
 unhen is mushkil sawaal se guzaranaa hi hoga
 Therefore, this election is for the youth
 ve media or netaa ke gadhe hue jhooth se haar jaaenge yaa donon ko haraa denge
 If the job is the issue then this election is a test for the youth
 bharat kii raajnneeti main agar naujavaanon kii zaraa bhi ahmiyat bachi hogi to naukari kaa sawaal bada hokar ubharegaa
 Otherwise this question will die
 main in haare hue naujavaanon se kya ummid karun, bas yahi dua karata hum ki ye media kii banaai dharna se apni haar bachaa len or apane mudde ko bachaa len
 In the 2019 elections, there is a fight against lies
 yah chunaav rahul banaam modi kaa nahin he
 This election is a question of the public
 jhooth se un sawaalon ke mukaable kaa he
 Will the public defeat the lie with their questions or lose it? Apart from this, it will be the most expensive election in India's politics

 On one hand, they say that the affidavit should be filed in the Supreme Court
 duusari taraf wo sharma kaa releaving order sin kar dete hai
 If the relieving order sign would have broken the sky after one day? To this, the AG said that Nageswara Rao has a 30-year impeccable career

 "we can confirm that the death toll has gone up to 11," Xinhua quoted police officer Yusuf Haier as saying

 The explosions occurred in two cars laden with explosives outside the Jazeera Hotel near Mogadishu Airport
 is hotel main sarkari adhikariyon or sthaneey kaarobaariyon kaa aana-janaa laga rahata he
 Local media said 10 people were killed and dozens were injured in the blast targeting the hotel

 After independence, Congress had the distinction of being with people of all religions and sects
 usne ise chunaavon main khub bhunaaya bhi
 This has been the case for many years, but gradually the system got the eye of other parties and the Congress's huge support base shifted
 90 kaa dashak aate-aate congress ke paale se dalit puri tarah se alag ho gaye
 He neither had strong Dalit leaders nor Dalit vote banks
 mayawati daliton kii sabase badi netri banakar ubharin or unhone unke vot bank ko jhatak liya
 As a result, he got tremendous success in UP
 agadi jatiyon kaa purazor virodh karke unhone daliton main apni jagah banaai or mukhyamantri pad kii daavedaar baniin
 Along with BJP, she also held the post of Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh
 lekin samay ke saath unhone ek baat samaj lee ki agadi jatiyon kaa virodh karke vah taumr satta main bani nahin rah saktin
 So he resorted to social engineering and took the Brahmins with him
 yah krantikari kadam tha or logon ne use badi hairaani se dekha
 The results of this were clearly visible in the election
 mayawati ne uttar pradesh jeet liya
 This was amazing of social engineering
 samay badal gaya he
 The BJP camp is no longer heard echoing the Ram temple
 party ko yah samaj main aa gaya ki nayaa sameekaran banaakar vah kuch kar sakati he
 In this episode, he also started resorting to a new type of social engineering
 usne sabase pehle maharashtra main arpiai (athawale) kaa saath liya jo apane ko daliton kii hamdard party bataati he
 There have been many pieces of this party influenced by Baba Saheb Ambedkar's thought stream, yet it has good influence in some pockets
 lekin ab ramvilas paswan kii algepi ke uske saath aane kii manshaa jataane se use bihar main ek saathi mil gaya he
 Paswan's party may not have done much in the last election, but it is true that his supporters are quite numerous
 vah apane boote bhale hi vot bank main tabdeel na ho paae, lekin bijepi jaisi party ke saath milakar kai siton par prabhaav chhod sakati he
 After Paswan, now Dalit leader and former bureaucrat Udit Raj has also joined BJP
 vot kii raajnneeti main beshak unki koi khaas takat nahin he lekin vah ek pratik chinh ke taur par party ko suut karte hai
 This time the BJP has made an attempt for social engineering
 vah congress ke vot bank main send to lagaana hi chaahati he bahujan samaaj party jaisi partiyon ke samarthakon ko bhi ek sandesh dena chaahati he
 It is his intention to take this large population of the country along with him because his support will be needed to hoist the flag at the Red Fort

 Former Union Home Secretary GK Pillai says that the affidavit given by the Home Ministry to Ishrat Jahan, executed in December 2004, was changed at the behest of then Home Minister p Chidambaram
 pillai kaa kahana he ki rajnatik kaarnon se grih mantralay ne ishrat se judaa afidavit badla tha
 Now there is a stir in the North Block
 enditivi india ko mili jaankaree ke mutabiq- - The Ministry of Home Affairs is studying the files associated with Ishrat
 - ye pataa lagane kii koshish kii ja rahi he ki purv grih sachiv ne kya nae afidavit par dastakhat karne se pehle apana aitaraaz darj karavaaya tha yaa nahin
 - And if not, on what basis did the new affidavit be signed
 - vaise ishrat maamle se judi kai filein gaayab hai jinhen dhundha ja rahaa he
 Allegations have been leveled against the Home Ministry that Chidambaram misused the NIA and forcibly changed the affidavit, a page in which the NIA called Ishrat linked to Lashkar
 tippaniyan On the other hand, Chidambaram says that he takes full responsibility for the new affidavit and he is right
 chidambaram ne media se kaha, 'main mantri ke taur par isaki puri zimmedaari letaa hum lekin ye dukh kii baat he ki purv grih sachiv ab isse duuri bana rahe hai kyonki wo bhi iske liye utane hi jimmedaar the
 ' vaise sibiai ne ishrat jahaan maamle main aarope patr to daayar kar diya he lekin aarope abhi tay nahin hue hai
 On this, the Home Ministry did not even allow the CBI to register a case against the ib's Rajinder Kumar and the rest of the officers because the evidence gathered by the CBI against them was insufficient
 yani maamla do saalon se vahiin atka padaa he jahaan se shuru hua tha

 There is hardly any incident on which his poet's mind has not written anything
 isaki vajah thi
 Kaifi wrote all kinds of nazams in this way, but his rebellion was more preferred
 isiilie vah urdu ke pragativaadee shaayaron main shumaar hue
 Kaifi Azmi was born on 14 January 1919 in Mouza Majwan District Azamgarh
 unka asli naam saiyad atahar hossain rizvi tha or kaifi tabllus
 Café's family was a happy landowner
 ghar main shiksha va sahitya or shae’r-o-shaayari kaa maahaul tha
 In such a situation, his interest in she'ar-o-adab was natural
 rivaaj ke mutabik unhone arabi, farsi main talim hasil kii or shae’r kehane lage
 He started with religious shayari and moved to the love poetry of love
 unki romani shaayari ke kya kehane -vakt ne kiya kya hansi sitamatum rahe na tum, ham rahe na ham
 
 
 *** a bowed gaze is irresponsible or not, is there love in the right heart or not? 
 
 ***tum itnaa jo muskura rahe hokya gam he jis ko chupa rahe ho
 
 
 *** Today i thought, tears were filled with tears, smiled, increased from one to another and poetry, great ghazals
 isi daur main shaayad unhone yah bhi likhaa-mere dil main tu hi tu he dil kii dawa kya karundil bhi tu he jaan bhi tu he tujhpe fidaa kya karuun
 
 
 But the feelings of love soon became associated with social concerns
 samay ke saath unki shaayari awam ke dukh-dard kaa pramanik dastavej ban gai
 He wrote his first rebel najam in student life when he went to get a religious education in a Shia madrasa

 Due to financial troubles, Kaifi also wrote songs for the films

 Gradually, Kaifi's association with films increased
 unhone gaanon ke alaava kahani, samvaad or script bhi likhe
 Even in the world of film and market, he stood by his values
 ‘kaagaz ke phool’, ‘garm hawa’, ‘haqiqat’, ‘hir raanjha’, jaisi filmon ke naam aaj bhi kaifi ke naam ke saath liye jate hai
 The film world also honored Kaifi Sahab with many accolades

 If you listen to the songs written by him, something still happens today - if you have met, then it seems that where a wandering traveler has got a caravan *** a little bit of a heart, the heart thinks it is not So no, is it not that *** someone was found there while walking, while walking all the way, he has remained stagnant, my night is moving and moving *** Slowly, my heart will come
 Yes, i do not want to yearn, i have to go slowly, slowly

 Farmer Sanjay Sathe, who made money money order to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, told Aaj Tak that the government is going to give a grant of Rs 150 crore i
e
 just 200 rupees for a quintal or just 2 rupees on a kg of onion

 He expressed displeasure that farmers' interest is being sold at Rs 100 a quintal
 yanikisanonko sirf ek rupaya prati kilo itnaa hi bhav mil rahaa he
 Sanjay Sathe suggests to the government that the same decision should be taken for all farmers
 saathe bataaya ki ek pratishthit sanstha jo pyaaj par research karti he uske mutabik ek kilo pyaaj ugane ke liye 8 se 9 rupaya kharchaa aata he
 So the government's account is going wrong somewhere or the government representatives do not know how to calculate it
 saathe ne kaha ki sarkaar ko aisa nirnay lenaa chahie tha jisase sabhikisanonko raahat mil sakati thi
 Sathe has requested all the farmers that this grant given by the government should not be accepted and pressure should be put on the government for a good declaration

 Apart from this, Rahul's sharp tweets on the social media, Shireana Var are very pleasing to the people
 yahi kaaran he ki abhi tak soshal media par bijepi se pichhadane vaali congress ab takkar de rahi he
 The alliance with the Congress and the Congress was not new in the Grand Alliance
 2015 bihar vidhansabha chunaav main bijepi ke khilaaf congress-rajd-jadyu ne gathbandhan kiya tha
 During this time, the pair of tejashwi-rahul was also seen together
 jadyu ne jab mahagathbandhan todakar bijepi se haath milaayaa, uske baad bhi congress-rajd saath hi rahe
 Congress President Sonia Gandhi also tried to resolve the matter between the two parties
 rahul ko yuva pasand hai!congress ko nae kalevar main laane kii koshishon main rahul gandhi apni puri takat jhonk rahe hai
 Rahul wants to connect the youth with himself, an example of which we found in the Uttar Pradesh elections

 Now in Bihar, Rahul's lunch with Tejashwi, in Gujarat also, Rahul's association with young leaders is an example of this

 During that time Rahul had said that 'all parties give tickets to tainters and it is time to stop it
 unhone kaha, 'main sabhi raajnneetik dalon se kahana chahta hum ki is tarah ke samjhaute karne se baj aaen
 Due to tearing of Rahul's ordinance, Lalu was banned from not contesting elections for 6 years

 Expressing concern over the continuing terrorism in Pakistan, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called on the leadership of the country to "wake up now" and said Islamabad should stop active jihadi groups against India from their lands
 karachi hamale ke sandarbh main pakistan ko bheje gaye ek sandesh main manmohan singh ne kaha he ki uske netritv ko yah samajhnaa chahie ki aatankwaad ne padosi desh ko bhi utana hi aahat kiya he, jitna bharat ko kiya he or unhen aatanki guton ke khilaaf zyada prabhavi karrwai kerani chahie
 The Prime Minister told reporters last night while returning from a six-day visit to Ethiopia and Tanzania that terrorism is unacceptable to the people of the civilized world as an important part of Pakistan's foreign policy
 manmohan singh ne kaha ki bharat iske bare main pakistan ko vishwaas dilaane ke liye harsambhav maukey kaa upyog karegaa
 The Prime Minister said, "as a neighbor of Pakistan, we are very concerned about the terrorism that has persisted there till now
" ham chahenge ki pakistan un jehadi samoohon kii gatividhiyon par ankush lagane ke liye or prabhavi karrwai kare jo khaas taur par bharat jaise desh ko nishaanaa banaate hai
 "in the context of the recent terrorist attack on Karachi's Pakistani Navy airbase," he said, "I have seen what is happening in Pakistan and i believe that Pakistan's leadership should wake up now and understand that There is terrorism or some terrorist elements are getting protection and these elements are not working for anyone's benefit
 ’’mumbai hamalon kii pakistan main chal rahi jaanch ke bare main singh ne kaha ‘‘hamen pakistan ko yah bharosa dilaanaa hoga ki hamaare kshetra main aatank kii samasya ke niptaare main unhen hamaari madad karnaa chahie or aisa karnaa unke hi hit main he
 "manmohan Singh said," Jehadi groups targeting India as a destination for their terror must be effectively curbed and dealt with
 yah ek jari prakriya he or hamen jab bhi avasar mili, pakistan par iske liye lagaataar dabaav banaate rahanaa chahie
 "the Prime Minister hoped that Pakistan would recognize the" monster "of terrorism which has hurt them as much as our country is hurt by it

 There is nothing new in it that we do not know
 ’’ singh ne kaha ki aatankwaad ko lekar vaishvik chintaa he or duniya ne dekha he ki aatank kaa centre bharat ke pados main he
 The Prime Minister said that the countries of the world have appreciated the idea of india and that "our effort should be to create a global public opinion that ensures that there is effective control of terrorism at the root of our neighboring Pakistan
" ’’karachi ke mehraan sainya adde par hue haalia aatanki hamale ke bare main poochne par singh ne kaha ‘‘main hameshaa se kahata rahaa hum ki ek majboot, sthir or shantipurna pakistan hamaare desh ke hit main he, isiilie vahaan ke ghatnakram hamen chintit kar jate hai
 Singh said that Pakistan needs to be assured that it should help India in tackling terrorism in the region and it is in its interest to do so
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main singh ne spasht kiya ki nikat bhavishya main pakistan kii yatra kii sambhaavna nahin he jisapar unhone saidhantik rup se sahmati jataayi thi
 He said, "I have not prepared myself yet

 *** President Barack Obama demanded that India open the market for American goods and capital, saying that if America has opened the market for those who trade with them, then they too have to give the same opportunity to America
 raashtrapati ne kaha, ‘ham bhartiya bazaaron main pahunch chaahate hai
 We want to sell our goods in India
 hamaare liye yah kahana anuchit nahin hoga ki agar hamane apana bazaar khol rakhaa he to jin deshon ke saath ham vyapaar karte hai unki arthvyavastha bhi hamaare liye khuli honi chahie
 On the second day of his visit, Obama was interacting with students at the famous St
 Javier's College in Mumbai
 unhone kaha, ‘hamen vyapaarik sambandh main ek duusare ke saath samaan bartaav karnaa chahie tabhi yah donon ke liye phydemand hoga
 The President said, "if the American people think that this trade is one-sided where everyone is selling their goods in the American market, but we cannot sell our goods anywhere, then the American people will start thinking that it is a bad for America Is the deal
 ’obama ne chetaya ki isse na keval damocrate, balki republican saansadon main or sangrakshanvaadi ravaiye ko protsaahan degaa
 So we have to be vigilant against it
 ’ haalanki raashtrapati ne yah aashwaasan diya ki vah vyapaar sambandh badhaane ke maamle main bharat kii har pahal par apni ore se bhi samuchit kadam uthayega
 Bilateral trade between India and US 36 in the year 2009-10
 6 arab dollars rahaa or obama ne agle paanch saal main bharat ko america kaa niryaat badhkar doguna hone kii kal ummid jataai
 India accounts for only two percent of total US exports
 obama ne kaha ki bharat ne haal ke aarthik sankat kaa sabase achche dhang se saamana kiya jabaki 2008 kaa vaishvik aarthik sankat ne america arthvyavastha ke liye sabase samay le kar aayaa
 The US President said, 'india is not only a growing force, but this country has become a force now
 isaki arthvyavastha teji se batch rahi he
 We expect India to play a larger role on the global stage
 ’ obama ne isi sandarbh main duniya ke pramukh viksit or vikasshil deshon ke manch ji-20 main bharat or america ke bich sahyog kaa ullekh kiya
 Referring to the changing global scenario, the President said that he had so far seen America as a force which was in a position to face the rest of the world
 ‘lekin ab bharat, china, brazil tathaa kuch anya deshon ke udai ke baad ab vaastavik pratispardhaa shuru hui he or yah pratispardhaa swasth rahane kii sambhaavna he
 This new situation has also forced America to gear up because we believe that we still have the ability to compete
 ’sangrakshanvaadi niti apnaane kii aalochana jhel rahe obama ne kaha ki america duniya kii sabase badi arthvyavastha or bahut bada bazaar he
 This does not mean that other countries come to sell their goods to us and do not give us a chance
 america main haal ke chunaav main apni demoketric party kii haar ke sawaal ke bare main puche jane par obama ne kaha ki america main berogari badhane or aarthik halaat main sudhaar kii dhimi raftaar ke kaaran logon main naaraazgi he
 He said that if the two sides do not move in the business, then in this regard, America will suffer
 america raashtrapati ne baatcheet main kaha unki is yatra kaa ek bada makasad asian deshon ke saath vyapaar badhaana he
 Obama said, "I believe that the growth and prosperity of the American economy will only happen when we do business with Asian countries
" asia is samay duniya main sabase teevr vruddhi vaala kshetra he
 We want to enter your market
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘ham maanate hai ki hamaare paas aap ko bechney ke liye achche achche saamaan hai or isi tarah aap logon ko bhi lagata he ki aapke paas hamen bechney ke liye achche saamaan he
 This has advantages in both
 ’america arthvyavastha kaa taaja chitra or america logon kii man:sthiti ko prastut karte hue obama ne kaha, ‘america main berogari bahut batch gayi he,isi kaaran log niraash he
 The biggest feature of a democratic system is that when people are not happy, they have the right to express their displeasure
 ’ sarkari aankado ke anusaar is samay america main berogari 9
 Has reached 6 percent
 obama ne kaha ki unka prashasan america ko tarakkee kii raah par aage badhaane ke liye patibaddh he
 'we have to invest in education for this because this will open the way for the future
 hamen apana buniyadi dhaancha majboot karnaa hoga
 We have to take advantage of opportunities in the field of clean energy
 ’ unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh se mulaakaat main vah in sabhi muddon par sahyog badhaane kii baat karenge
 He said that in such cooperation with both countries "both sides will benefit, i want to make it clear that i have come here because it will increase employment in America and create new employment opportunities in India too
" ’ america raashtrapati ne yatra ke pehle din bharat or america companiyon ke bich 10 arab dollars ke vibhinn saudon kii ghoshnaa kii

 pashchim bengal kii darjeeling sansadeey seat par rochak muqabla hone ke asaar hai
 In the Lok Sabha elections 2019, BJP has cut the tweet of sitting MP Surendrajeet Singh Ahluwalia as Raju Vishtha who is facing challenge from Amar Singh Roy of TMC
 congress ne shankar maalaakaar par daanv khelaa he to sipiem, saman pathak ke bharose is seat ko jeetne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Apart from this, four party candidates are also in the fray along with Bahujan Samaj Party, Indian Democratic Republican Front, Gorkha National Congress, Rashtriya Jan Chetchan Party, All India Jan Andolan Party, Amar Bengali
 bataa den ki pashchim bengal kii teen siton par 18 april ko duusare phej main matdaan hona he
 After the announcement of Lok Sabha elections 2019 on 10 March, the country has come into the electoral atmosphere
 19 march ko is seat ke liye notification niklaa, 26 march ko nomination kii antim taarikh, 27 march ko ummidavaaron kii antim list par muhar lagi
 Now all the parties have given their strength for the April 18 voting
 loksabhaa chunaav 2019 ke duusare charan main 13 rajyon kii 97 loksabhaa siton par matdaan hona he
 The result of the vote is to come on 23 May
 loksabhaa chunaav 2014 main bhartiya janata party (bijepi) ne pashchim bengal main jin do siton par jeet hasil kii thi, unamem se ek darjeeling sansadeey kshetra shaamil he
 The bjp's victory in the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat was eased in the last elections with the support of Modi wave and Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (gojamu)
 naagarikta sanshodhan vidheyak 2016 ke sahare pashchim bengal main apane liye raste talash rahi bijepi kaa abhi darjeeling loksabhaa seat par kabja he or surendrajit singh ahaluwalia saansad he
 In the 2009 elections, bjp's Jaswant Singh came to Parliament after choosing from Darjeeling
 baharhaal, kabhi vam morcha kaa garh rahe pashchim bengal main bijepi apane liye sambhaavnaaen talash rahi he
 In most parts of the country, the Modi wave showed its effect, but despite this, BJP could win only two seats in this state, Darjeeling and Asansol
 haalanki darjeeling loksabhaa seat par bijepi kaa 2009 se kabja he
 The 2014 elections saw a close fight between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress
 lekin 2009 ke mukaable 2014 ke chunaavon main mat pratishat ke lihaaj se bijepi ko nuksaan bhi dekhne ko mila
 BJP candidate Ahluwalia by 4,88,257 votes i
e
 42 in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 73 fisadi vot ke saath jeet hasil kii thi
 While Baichung Bhutia of Trinamool Congress got 2,91,018 votes, which is 25 of the total voting
 47 fisadi he
 The most interesting is that in the 2009 elections, the Trinamool Congress was not in the scene on this seat, but in the 2014 elections, the party led by Mamata Banerjee finished second, while the CPI (M) slipped to the third position
 2009 ke chunaavon main bijepi ke jaswant singh 4,97,649 vot yani 51
 50 percent of the votes were received, but in 2014 it was reduced to 42
 73 fisadi par pahunch gaya
 In this context, even though the BJP is looking at possibilities for itself in West Bengal, its declining vote percentage in Darjeeling tells a different story
 darjeeling kaa sansadeey itihaashparyatakon kii pasand or chaay ke bagaanon ke liye janaa jane vaala darjeeling sansadeey kshetra 1957 main astitv main aayaa he or us saal hue chunaavon main yahaan congress ke theodor manen janpratinidhi chunakar sansad pahunche the
 After this, in the next Lok Sabha elections held in 1962, only Theodore Manen won elections on a Congress ticket
 aam taur par is seat par congress or marxvaadi communist party (makapa) ke bich hi muqabla rahaa he
 But in the elections held in 1967, independent candidate M
 basu ne jeet hasil kii thi
 CPI-M candidate Ratanlal Brahmin won the 1971 election for the fifth Lok Sabha
 1977 ke chunaavon main makapa ke krishna bahadur chhetri saansad chune gaye jabaki 1980, 1984 ke chunaavon main makapa ke hi anand pathak chunaav jitkar sansad pahunche the
 In 1989 elections for the Ninth Lok Sabha, Indrajit of Gorkha National Liberation Front managed to win the election
 baad main indrajit congress main shaamil ho gaye or 1991 main phir hue chunaavon main congress kii tikat par vah dobaaraa jitkar sansad pahunche
 After this, in the 1996 elections, the CPI (M) returned to this seat and the party's candidate R
 bi
 Rai was elected as an MP
 1998 main makapa ke hi anand pathak yahaan se sansadeey chunaav jite jabaki 1999 main isi left party ke es
 P
 lepcha chunaav jeetne main safal rahe
 In 2004, again the picture of this seat changed and Congress candidate Dawa Harbul won the election
 lekin 2009 main yah seat bijepi ke khate main aa gai or mul rup se rajasthan se taalluk rakhane vaale jaswant singh yahaan se saansad bane
 In 2014, SS Ahluwalia was elected to the Lok Sabha from here

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscribakaren ajtak kaa ellection special newzlator In July this year, India Today revealed how the pollution of the river Ganges on the Ghats of Varanasi had increased more than in 2014
 2014 main modi sarkaar ne ganga nadi kii safai ke liye mahatvakankshi ‘namaami gange’ mishan kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Read this: Exclusive: How Namami Gange? In the time of the Modi government and the muddy Ganga, 58% bacteria grew, India Today sent a petition under the Right to Information (RTI) to the Ganga Revival Ministry to know more about the level of cleanliness in the country's most sacred river
 yachika main hamane ganga ko saaf karne ke liye shuru kiye gaye nae project, unhen kitna paisa aavantit kiya gaya, unke puraa hone kii tithi or unke sambhavit asar ke bare main poocha gaya
 In response, the Government of India said, '20,000 crores has been allocated for this project which will be spent in the next five years (2015-2020)'
 jawaab main aage kaha gaya he ki ab takanmaami gangakaryakram ke tahat kul 221 project vibhinn tarah kii gatividhiyon ke liye sweekrut kiye gaye hai
 22238 in these activities
 73 karod rupye kii laagat se municipal sivej treetment, audyogic kachare kaa treetment, nadi kii sataha kii safai aadi shaamil he
 58 of these projects have been completed
 is jawaab ke myne kya nikalate hai ki projects par aavantit fund se 2238
 73 crores more has been approved and there is still a year and a half left
 lekin abhi tak kul sweekrut projects main se ek chauthai hi puure kiye ja sake hai
 Regarding the sewage treatment plant, the RTI reply said that so far 105 sewerage infrastructures and STP projects have been approved, out of which 3293 untreated
 68 MLD sivej ko ganga nadi main sidhe girane se roka ja sakegaa
 a total of 26 projects have been completed so far '
 yahaan bhi sweekrut projects main se sirf ek chauthai hi puure kiye ja sake hai
 The government further said in its reply, 'projects taken so far will take care of all the steps required for sewage treatment needs of the Ganga's main stream by 2035'
 may 2018 main kendriya jal sansaadhan mantrinitin garkarine ganga ko saaf karne ke liye march 2019 kii nai dedline tay kii thi
 At the same time, it was claimed that by then the quality of Ganga water will be improved by 70 to 80 percent
 aisi surat main jab agast 2018 tak sweekrut projects main sirf ek chauthai hi puure kiye ja sake hai, to sarkaar kaise ganga kii safai ko lekar apane vaadon ko puraa kar sakegi? agle 6-7 maheenon main koun sa chamatkaar hoga? 2014 loksabhaa chunaav se pehle bijepi ke bade chunavi muddon main ganga kii safai kaa mudda bhi ahm tha
 But according to the government's own state report, the promise of cleaning the Ganga is very unlikely to be fulfilled
 india today ke RTI khulaase par sarkaar ne kya kaha?‘neshnal mishan for clin ganga (NMCG) ganga ko svachh karne ke lakshya ko hasil karne ke liye patibaddh he or is disha main mishan mod main kaam kar rahaa he
 "given the current pace of implementation and execution of projects, the goal of cleaning the Ganga will be achieved as soon as possible"
 sarkaar kii ore se ye bhi kaha gaya he ki jo 20,000 karod rupye kaa bajet aavantit hua he usamen lagbhag 17,000 karod rupye hi ab tak sweekrut hue hai

 Jiya Nath first saw a spiritual dance at the Osho Ashram in Pune
 unhen yaad he kis tarah ve ek duusari hi duniya main chali gai thim
 Nath spent the next five years getting to know about the movements of this dance, which included turning round like a dervish
 ab 25 saal baad nath jaani-maani nrutyaangna hai jinhone gurjef (pavitra nrity kii ek shrunkhlaa) or orishi kii diksha lee he
 Nath, who has taught people whirling, says, "it is a natural thing to go round

 "they do skull therapy during the day, which diverts most of their attention
" iske baad bhi ve desh bhar main niyamit workshop kar paati hai, jinhen 'verlig mandal' kaha jaataa he, or nrity pradarshan bhi, jinhen 'shills of dance' naam diya gaya he (donon naamon ko nath ne trademark karavaaya he)

 ' During his nearly three-decade tenure at Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), what set Ravi Parthasarathy apart from the rest of the ceos was his ability to make and sustain decisions
 is sari prakriya main unhone ek aisa santhaan khadaa kar liya jiskaa salanaa rajasav 19,000 karod ru
 Was close to use bharat main public privet partnership (pipipi) kaa janak mana jaataa tha or uske paas sadak, pani, urja, bandargah, kshetreey vikaas or paryaavaran infrastracchar jaise vividh kshetron main pariyojnaon ko amali jama pehanaane kaa visheshgy mana jaataa tha
 His financial structure was impregnable until his long-term liabilities began to run into trouble
 isse company ke astitv par hi khatra mandaraane laga or iske dar se share bazaaron main bhuuchaal aa gaya
 Then, in a surprise move, on 1 October, the central government took steps to reassure the financial markets when this company started defaulting on its debt repayment and the entire non-banking financial company (NBFC) sector was threatened The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) changed all the members of the company's board by filing a petition
 ab kotak mahindra bank ke vaais chairman or emdi udai kotak ke netritv main chah sadasyon ke board ke kaam sambhaal lene se company kaa nayaa daur shuru ho gaya he
 66-year-old Parthasarathy, a post-graduate in business administration from Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad, joined IL&FS in 1987 as President and CEO
 phir 1989 main unhen prabandh nideshak bhi bana diya gaya
 Merchant bankers who have worked with him in various projects say Parthasarathy's aggression as CEO came in the early 1990s for an early company like IL&FS as he benefited both from fund raising and infrastructure projects
 swatantra salaahkaar aswin paarekh kaa kahana tha, "ve bahut zyada ashaavadi the
 "it was a feat of achievement for Parthasarathy that in 2011, IL&FS took control of Maytas Infrastructure just before the Satyam scandal surfaced
 vah bhi ramling raju pramoted company thi
 He then established the IL&FS Transportation Network (ITNL) as a major player in the road sector
 iske alaava unhone group kaa vistaar kai kshetron main kiya or unamem se harek main sabsidiari companiyaan sthapit kar leen
 The company became a group of nearly 200 firms that were under IL&FS as a whole holding firm — including a dozen companies, 23 direct subsidiaries and 141 indirect subsidiaries
 inke alaava chah sanyukt upkram the or chaar associat companiyaan
 As the firm progressed, Parthasarathy's status continued to grow
 ve 1994 main vaais-chairman or emdi bana die gaye or phir november 2004 main chairman or emdi ban gaye
 The fast moving Parthasarathy was helped in the early stages by the fact that the economy was in great need of infrastructure funding at that time
 sarkaar ne saal 1991 main jab udaarikaran kii niti apanaai to pipipi kshetra main pariyojnaon kii behad jarurat thi
 What was needed at that time can be gauged from the fact that the three large state-owned institutions - the Central Bank of India, the then Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and the Unit Trust of India - pledged to form IL&FS
 
 baad main tab santhaan ko behatar financing kii jarurat mahasoos hui to usne iske alaava do bade antarrashtriya khiladinnon ke liye bhi khud ko khol diya—mitsubishi (japan ke orics korporation ke jariye) or abu dhabi investment athurity

 42 per cent)
 lekin jab parthasarathi teji se kaarobaar ko badha rahe the or tab takreeban har dhanchaagat kshetra main dakhal de chuke the
 On the other hand, perhaps they were ignoring the situation in the long run
 is prakriya main ielandeeyes ne kareeb 91,000 karod ru
 Took over his head and then he defaulted in repaying the loan
 is saal july main swasthya kaarnon se parthasarathi ke achaanak istife ne bhram main or ijapha kiya
 Says Parekh, "I felt that there was something structural disturbance because there were no long liabilities
 '' ielandeeyes 10 saal se lambii avadhi vaali dderghaavadhi pariyojnaon kii funding to karata he lekin uski udhari kam avadhi vaali hoti hai, jisase parisampatti-dendaree antar bad jaataa he
 Parthasarathy was hopeful that the government would do two things — one that the moment a project starts operating, the government will set up a buyout system of some sort and the other set up a debt promotion bureau so that whenever an infrastructure funding organization If the project does not seem feasible, the bureau will intervene and provide some kind of buffer or liquidity
 paarekh kehete hai, "inamen se kuch bhi nahin hua
 In this backdrop, IL&FS should have understood that they are running with their legs tied
 '' dhire-dhire dabaav ban rahaa tha
 The group's consolidated debt stood at Rs 11,211 crore in the financial year 2017-18

 Most of it (82 per cent or 74,591 crore)
 ) uski sabsidiariyon kii taraf se aayaa tha
 It did not take long for infrastructure projects in India to get caught in the policy trap
 america main liman sankat ke aasapaas hi hamaare yahaan bhi kai badi pariyojnaayen, khaas taur par bijli kshetra kii pariyojnaayen gatirodh main funs gayi
 IL&FS also had a lot of problems with him but Parthasarathy kept the hopes still and he was busy raising more and more wealth
 company kii kharaab sehat ke pehle sanket saal 2014-15 kii arabiai kii salanaa nirikshan report se milane lage the
 It said that the funds owned by IL&FS Financial Services have been wiped out and now they are being exploited more than the reality
 lekin ielandeeyes ke prabandhan ne rigerv bank ke najariye kaa khandan kiya or koi sudharatmak kadam uthaane se inkaar kar diya
 This was the restraint when Parthasarathy's health was also falling and he was preparing to come out
 uske baad se kuch bhi sahi nahin hua

 During the last few months, the company repeatedly defaulted on loan repayment

 When a financier, considered "structurally important" in the rbi's view, has so much debt on his forehead, he is in a big crisis according to experts
 khatra yah he ki ielandeeyes kii udhari kaa takreeban 60 fisadi non-canvertible dibentures ke rup main he jo kisi bhautik sampada yaa pratibhuti se surakshit nahin hote
 The bulk of these debentures are with insurance companies, pension funds and provident funds, on which all the savings of the middle class of the country depend
 isliye kuch bhi dhaha to deshbhar ke saare enbiensi ke liye iske gambhir nattejey honge
 The daggers are already out in political circles and the opposition Congress has accused the Narendra Modi government of bringing India to the "brink of economic destruction"

 The stock markets also had to bear the brunt of the IL&FS crisis and the BSE Sensex fell by over 1,000 points on September 21

 upi ke siem akhilesh yadav ke chachaa or mulaayam singh ke bhai ramgopal yadav ko samaajawaadee party se 6 saal ke liye nikaala ja chukaa he
 Mulayam's other brother Shivpal himself had announced the removal of Ram Gopal from Mulayam's hand, but when the issue of demonetisation was discussed, Ram Gopal only spoke on the time given to the Samajwadi Party
 rajyasabha tivi kii taraf se unako sapa kaa netaa hi likhaa gaya
 The rest of the SP MP said - Ram Gopal was our leader in the Rajya Sabha
 On the first day of the winter session, when the MP of the SP came to the Rajya Sabha, the question was, who will be the new leader in place of Ram Gopal who was removed from the party? But Naresh Aggarwal said that Kiramgopal Yadavahi is the leader of SP in Rajya Sabha
 phir kya tha, notebandi par vipaksh kii taraf se congress ke anand sharma ne bahes shuru kii, to sarkaar kii taraf se mantri piyush goyal ne jawaab diya or teesraa number ramgopal kaa aayaa
 He put a lot of siege on the problems facing the women and farmers in the government
 rajyasabha main ramgopal hi sapa ke netasapa se 6 saal ke nikaale gaye ramgopal hi abhi party ke rajyasabha main netaa hai, unako party se nikaale jane kii or nae netaa ko chune jane kii koi chitthirajyasabhaschivalay ko nahin di gai
 That is why Ram Gopal is currently the leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha and he gave a speech as the SP leader in the Rajya Sabha at the time of the party meeting
 baad main aaj tak baatcheet main ramgopal ne kaha ki unhone rajyasabha main bataur sapa netaa ke taur par apni baat kahi or vaise bhi main janmajaat netaa hum or apane netaji (mulaayam singh) kaa sammaan karata hum
 On the advice of Ram Gopal Ram Ram Gopal, who is close to Akhilesh and opposed to Amar Singh, Mulayam made Akhilesh the CM in 2012
 ramgopalhi amar singh kii sapa se vidaai kii vajah bane the
 Now Ram Gopal has been advocating handing over SP to Akhilesh and sidelining amar-shivpal

 cartoonist aseem trivedi ne buudhvaar ko kaha ki unhone cartoon banaakar koi galati nahin kii isliye vah koi maafee nahin maangenge kyonki unhone koi galati nahin kii
 Jailed cartoonist Aseem Trivedi was released on Wednesday on charges of treason
 india against karpshan (iasi) ke kaaryakarta trivedi par lagaae gaye aaropon par deshbhar main tikhi pratikriya ke baad mangalvaar ko unhen jamaanat di gai thi
 Trivedi was kept in Arthur Road Jail
 unhone jail se rihaai ke turant baad kaha, 'main kanoon kaa sammaan karata hum lekin main us kanoon kaa sammaan nahin karata jo hamen yah mahasoos karaata ho ki ham ek swatantra desh main nahin rah rahe hai
 When asked whether it was appropriate to make a cartoon showing the 26 / 11 attack terrorist Ajmal Kasab urinating on the Indian constitution, Trivedi said that he did what he saw and would look at it in another way The reason is not
 unhone kaha ki unhen maafee maangane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 He said, 'this fight is my fight, which does not end here
 ham tab tak ladaai jari rakhenge jab tak ki bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 124e ke tahat lagaae gaye rajdroh ke aarope nirast nahin kiye jate
 He said, 'we will continue this fight for freedom of expression
 ' trivedi kii rihaai ke samay unke swaagat ke liye jail ke baahar iasi kaaryakarta mayank gandhi sahit kareeb 50 log maujuud the
 IAC members continued to shout slogans outside the jail for about 10 minutes and then left as a small procession after Trivedi's release

 Ajmal Kasab, who is guilty of 26 / 11 terror attack, is lodged in this jail
 trivedi ne baad main unki ladaai main media se mili samarthan ke liye use dhanyavad diya
 Trivedi said that he is grateful to everyone who supports him
 pehle jamaanat par reeha hone se inkaar kar die jane ke vishay main puche jane par unhone kaha ki vah chaahate the ki sabase pehle sarkaar un par lagaae gaye rajdroh ke aarope hataae
 He said, 'I don't want the message to go that i am not cooperating but i also wanted the government to admit that it had made a mistake by accusing me of treason
 isiilie maine pehle jamaanat par reeha hone se inkaar kar diya tha
 He said, 'I am not a non-cooperation person and i accepted bail when IAC members talked to me in this regard
 'bombay ucch nyaayalay ne sanskaar marathe naam ke ek vakil dwaara daayar kii gai janhit yachika par sunwaayee karte hue mangalvaar ko 5,000 rupee ke nijee muchalke par jamaanat dene kaa faisla sunaaya tha
 Trivedi was arrested last Saturday and sent to seven days police custody on 24 September
 un par disambar 2011 main anna hajaare ke bhrashtachar virdohi andolan ke dauraan cartoon banaakar samvidhan sahit rashtriya pratik kaa apmaan karne par rajdroh kaa aarope lagaaya gaya tha
 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani also came forward in support of cartoonist Aseem Trivedi
 unhone kaha ki kathith rajdroh ke aarope main trivedi kii giraftaar par vah aashcharyachakit hai or unhen lagata he ki vartmaan raajnneetik vyavastha apatkaal se bhi buree he
 On Wednesday, Advani wrote on his blog that he had always considered the Emergency from 1975 to 77 as the worst time ever in terms of suppression of civil liberties and freedom of expression
 unhone kaha, 'lekin raajnneetik cartoonist va bhrashtachar virdohi andolankaaree aseem trivedi ke saath jo kuch hua use dekhakar main aashcharyachakit hum or mujhe lagata he ki kya aaj kii raajnneetik vyavastha apatkaal se bhi buree he
 Trivedi was granted bail by the Bombay High Court on Tuesday but has refused to be released until the charges of treason against him are dropped
 udhar, shivasena pramukh bal thakare ne bhi trivedi kaa samarthan kiya
 But he pulled Trivedi and warned him not to do so further
 thakare ne mumbai police dwaara trivedi par lagaae gaye rajdroh ke aarope ko bahut bada aarope bataaya
 But he also pulled up Trivedi for making fun of Indian national icons, the Constitution and Parliament through cartoons
 unhone party ke mukhpatr 'saamana' main likhe sampadakeey main kaha ki trivedi ne nishchit rup se rashtriya chihnon kaa apmaan kiya he lekin unhen rajdroh ke aarope main jail main daalana sahi nahin he
 In parallel to Afzal Guru, the terrorist who attacked Parliament 11 years ago, he said that even after he was sentenced to death, he is enjoying the hospitality of the government, whereas Trivedi, who made only one cartoon, was accused of treason
 Are given
 khud bhi cartoonist rah chuke thakare ne kaha ki trivedi ne apane cartoon ke jariye ghotaalon se grasit sansad kii vartmaan dukhad sthiti dikhaai he lekin iskaa matlab yah nahin he ki vah simaaen tod sakate hai
 Thackeray said that Trivedi says that he created this cartoon filled with patriotic spirit but he should respect the Parliament and should not insult it in this way
 vidhansabha chunaav se kuch din pehle maharashtra antarrashtriya shiksha board (MIEB) kii chauthi kaksha kii pustakon se chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kaa itihaas hataae jane se vivaad paidaa ho gaya he
 The Department of Education is criticizing the move
 vahiin maharashtra rajya shaikshik anusandhan evam prashikshan parishad (MSCERT) ne is vivaad ke liye ‘galatfahami' ko jimmedaar tehraaya or kaha ki paathyakram se shivaji maharaj ko hataane kaa koi praytn nahin kiya gaya he
 On the other hand, seeing the aggressive attitude of the opposition Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Minister of State Vinod Tawde said that the chapter of the 17th century Maratha warrior king will be included in the fourth grade history text book
 congress mahasachiv jyotiraditya sindhiya, maharashtra congress pramukh balasaheb thoraat or purv mukhyamantri ashok chavaan ne isaki aalochana kii he
 Thorat and Chavan said that this reflected the "fake" love of the bjp-shiv Sena government towards Shivaji
 vahiin nasik ke nandagaanv main ek chunavi raily ko sambodhit karte hue rakanpa pramukh sharad pavaar ne kaha, 'yah adhyay isliye tha taaki chauthi kaksha ke chaatr shivaji maharaj ke kaam ko samajhen, lekin sarkaar ne ab us adhyay ko hataa diya he
 'he said,' but that chapter has been removed
 
 
 or ye log shivaji kii vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par rajya ko aage le jane kii baat karte hai
 Earlier, School Education Minister Vinod Tawde said on Thursday that the MIEB syllabus does not have separate syllabus till class four
 unhone kaha ki chaar saal pehle astitv main aae board ke antargat itihaas, bhugol or vigyaan jaise alag-alag vishay kaksha paanch se shuru kiye jaaenge
 However, according to media reports, Shivaji's life and events related to his life have been removed from the books of class four of MIEB
 MSCERT ke up nideshak vikaas gaarad ne kaha, 'is vishay par kuch galatfahami rahi or adhuri jaankaree di gai
 There has been no attempt to remove Chhatrapati Shivaji from the syllabus of the State Board
 ' unhone kaha ki MIEB ne haal hi main 81 skool shuru kiye hai
 History subject will be started from class five, with emphasis on ancient and medieval history
 ' kaksha chah se shivaji maharaj kaa vistrut itihaas padhaane kii yojana he
 The Maharashtra International Board of Education was established when Tawde was the Minister of Education
 vahiin, taavade ne kaha, ‘yadi aap kaksha chah kii pustakon ko dekhenge to aapako chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kii uplabdhiyon kaa ullekh milegaa

 It was four months before the two national parties of the country — BJP and Congress — got entangled in a fierce allegation-counter-allegation over data theft

 yah ap soviet sangh main janme cambridge uniwarsity ke america vidwaan alexandra kogan ne banaaya tha

 Anand dismisses the power of social media data to influence elections, saying that the user profiles of platforms like Facebook do not necessarily provide information like caste and political leanings that are very important for India's elections
 ve kehete hai, "2014 main soshal media kii paith aaj ke mukaable kahin kam thi
 To say that Facebook data will help in creating a successful election campaign is currently a 10-year leap of faith

 Praveen Chakraborty, who heads the data analytics wing of the Congress, admits that social media makes it easier for anyone to deliver their message in a targeted manner, but it cannot anticipate the voter's behavior in advance
 ve kehete hai, "fasebuk ke rujhaanon se matadaata ke bartaav ke bare main jaanane or bataane ko hindustan ke sandarbh main bahut bad-chadhakar aanka or bataaya ja rahaa he
 Contrary to his claim, a 2013 study published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences proved that if one had enough data, one could be quite accurate about sensitive personal qualities, including political views based on mere "likes" Can be guessed

 But Chakraborty flatly rejected ca's claim that he had helped political parties to win elections with his data analysis
 ve kehete hai, "data or unka vishleshan chunavi ranneeti main upyogi input ho sakate hai
 But to say that data analytics alone will win the elections is a matter of exaggeration

 a security researcher in Delhi named Karan Saini claimed on March 23 that he had detected data leaks in the system

 These companies do not take all the measures that are necessary to protect data
 duggal kehete hai, "aadhaar ab ek anivaary system ho chukaa he jisamen kai nijee santhaan bhi jude hue hai
 "the problem with programs like Aadhaar and Facebook is that their data is massively centralized and that a single dent in the space means that the entire database would be in danger," says Pranesh Prakash, policy director at the Center for Internet and Society

 patna ke mahavir cancer santhaan ko cancer ke ilaaj ke liye janaa jaataa he
 We arrived at the institute on Monday morning during the shoot of the prime time show
 aspataal main kaaphi bheed thi
 Different types of people were visible
 cancer jaisi beemaari rogi or unke parivaar ke upar kya chhap chhod gai he yah sab nazar aa rahaa tha
 The patients and their relatives suffering from this disease all looked upset
 jab shoot chal rahaa tha, meri nazar idhar udhar gum rahi thi
 Meanwhile, my eyes fell on an elder, this elderly man sitting with his head bowed looked quite upset
 phir main unase baat karne laga
 His name is Subansh Sahu, hailing from a small village in Jehanabad district of Bihar
 teen maheene se apni patni kaa ilaaj karvaa rahe hai
 Earlier, undergoing treatment in a hospital in Jehanabad, now for about a month, he is getting treatment in this Mahavir institute
 akele apni patni kii seva karte hai, patni ko jaanch ke liye le janaa, bathroom le janaa, dawaai khilaanaa, jarurat padane par paanv main tel bhi laga dete hai, har tarah se khyaal rakhte hai
 When i asked how much money the treatment cost? His answer was, so far about 60 thousand rupees have been spent
 gaanv main jo bhens thi use bech chuke hai
 Now they have started to fear that how much money will be spent next and where they will come from
 is aspataal main bipiel card dhariyon ko lagbhag mukt main ilaaj kii suvidha di jaati he
 This elder had a BPL card earlier, but his name was removed from the BPL list a few months ago
 mere man main kai sawaal khadey ho rahe the
 While talking, i asked if no one else came from your family to take care of your wife
 The elders paused for a while, sighing in long breath, having three sons and a daughter
 lekin betaa log poochta nahin
 a son lives in Patna
 sirf ek baar milane aayaa tha, kuch der ruk kar chalaa gaya
 When i asked if your son does not take you home
 bujurg kii ankhon main aansu mujhe saafe nazar aa rahe the
 He was trying to hide his tears but could not hide
 ruk-ruk kar bole, betaa kahata he agar yah unki biimaar patni ko ghar main rakhega to vah bhi is beemaari kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 Hearing this, the people sitting there were surprised
 log baat karne lage, ek betaa aisa kaise kar saktaa he
 Then i asked, don't you also have two more sons? Nobody asks the answer of the elderly
 koi bhi ilaaj ke liye paisa nahin diya
 Sometimes he calls and talks but till date no one came to meet him
 jab bujurg apni baat bataa rahe the tab unki biimaar patni kaa dukh mujhe saafe nazar aa rahaa tha
 She had become very emotional
 munh chhipaakar ro rahi thi
 But still she was not complaining about her sons
 unki ankhon main maa kii mamata saafe jhalak rahi thi
 The comments phir maine poocha, kya aapaki beti bhi aap ko nahin puuchhati he
 The elder's answer was, the daughter asks
 jab jahanabad main the tab beti ek maheene ke liye rukii thi or seva bhi kii thi
 But when she came to Patna, the daughter could not come
 beti kii shaadi ho chuki he or use apane sasuraal kaa khyaal bhi rakhana he
 But the daughter calls and asks about the situation
 bujurg ne yah bhi bolaa, 'mujhe apni beti par garv he
 ' phir jab main vahaan se nikalne vaala tha, bujurg ne mujhase mere bare main poocha? maine bolaa ki main media se hum or yahaan hamaara shoot chal rahaa he
 So the elder asked, will you print my news? Then i questioned him, what would be your benefit from printing? The answer of the elderly was, even if i do not benefit, but such a story should be published
 agar aisi kahani ek bete ke man main apane mata-pita ke liye pyaar paidaa kar sakati he to yah bahut badi baat he

 agar aisi kahani ek bete ke man main apane mata-pita ke liye pyaar paidaa kar sakati he to yah bahut badi baat he
 Many questions were arising in my mind
 baat karte-karte maine yah puch liya ki kya aapaki patni kii dekhbhaal karne ke liye aapke parivaar se or koi nahin aayaa? bujurg thodi der ruk gaye, lambi saans lete hue bole, teen betaa or ek beti he
 But the son does not ask
 ek betaa patna main rahata he
 Came to meet only once, stopped for a while
 maine jab poocha ki kya aapkaa betaa aap logon ko apane ghar nahin le jaataa
 i could clearly see tears in the eyes of the elderly
 vah apane aansu chhipaane kii koshish kar rahe the lekin chipa nahin paa rahe the
 Intermittently speaking, the son says that if he keeps his sick wife in the house, then he can also become a victim of this disease
 yah baat sunakar vahaan par baithe log hairaan ho gaye
 People started talking, how can a son do this
 phir maine poocha, aapke jo do or bete hai kya vah bhi nahin poochhate hai? bujurg kaa jabaab tha koi nahin poochta
 Nobody paid for the treatment
 kabhi-kabhi phone kar baat kar letaa he lekin aaj tak koi milane nahin aayaa
 When the elders were talking about me, the grief of their sick wife was clearly visible to me
 vah kaaphi bhavuk ho gai thi
 She was crying secretly
 lekin phir bhi khud apane beton kii shikaayat nahin kar rahi thi
 Her mother's affection was clearly visible in her eyes
 tippaniyan Then i asked, does not your daughter also ask you
 bujurg kaa jawaab tha, beti puuchhati he
 While in Jehanabad, the daughter stayed for a month and also served
 lekin jab patna aa gaye tab beti nahin aa pai
 The daughter is married and has to take care of her in-laws
 lekin beti phone karke haalchaal jarur puuchhati he
 The elder also said, 'I am proud of my daughter
 ' Then when i was about to leave, the elder asked me about me? i said that i am from the media and our shoot is going on here
 to bujurg ne poocha, meri yah khabar aap chhaapenge? phir maine unase sawaal kiya ki chhapane se aapkaa kya phayda hoga? bujurg kaa jabaab tha, chaahe meraa phayda ho na ho lekin aisi kahani chapani chahie
 If such a story can instill a son's love for his parents, then it is a big deal
 bujurg kii ankhon main aansu mujhe saafe nazar aa rahe the
 He was trying to hide his tears but could not hide
 ruk-ruk kar bole, betaa kahata he agar yah unki biimaar patni ko ghar main rakhega to vah bhi is beemaari kaa shikaar ho saktaa he

 India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval also reached Beijing to join it
 videsh mantralay ke sutron ke mutabik aisi ghatnaayen pehle bhi hoti rahi hai or unka hal nikaal liya jaataa he

 They have said that it is a matter of international border and is very sensitive
 unhone kaha ki hamaari sena har mushkil se nipatane ke liye vahaan maujuud he
 The BJP emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra's election results, but fell behind by 22 seats by a majority, while the party's old ally Shiv Sena stood second with 63 seats
 is puure nateezon main jahaan bhaajapa ko ab kisi sahyogi kii darkaar dikhaai de rahi he vahiin, shivasena jo bhaajapa kii 25 saal tak sahyogi rahi ne, ab zyada maangane kii sthiti main nahin he
 The reason for this is that the NCP has announced its support for the BJP government from outside
 isse mana ja rahaa he ki shivasena ko dabaav banane kaa mauka nahin mil rahaa he
 The NCP has 41 seats in this election and the BJP needs only 22 seats for a majority
 ullekhneey he ki anya ke paas bhi 19 siten he

 iran ke vivaadasapad parmaanu kaarykram par kadaa rukh akhriyaar karte hue sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ne buudhvaar ko uske khilaaf nae prabitabandh laga die jinamein uske shaktishaalee revolutionari guards or parmaanu sambandhi nivesh ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya he
 Twelve members of the UN Security Council, with five permanent members and 10 non-permanent members, voted in support of the sanctions resolution against Iran, while Brazil and Turkey opposed the sanctions and voted in favor of Iran
 lebanon ekmaatr aisa sadsy rahaa jisane matdaan main hissaa nahin liya
 The resolution brought in the UN Security Council on Wednesday was the fourth resolution against Iran which passed by 12 votes against two
 isamen videshon main parmaanu gatividhiyon main iran ke nivesh par pratibandh, belistic missile gatividhiyon par pabandi, iran dwaara videshon main bainkon ke istemaal par roak or islamic revolutionari gords kor ke sadasyon kii sampatti jabt karne jaise pratibandh shaamil hai
 Under this proposal, 15 enterprises operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, three enterprises of the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and 23 industrial companies have been blacklisted
 antarrashtriya samudaay kaa aarope he ki iran parmaanu hathiyaar banane kaa prayaas kar rahaa he lekin iran is aarope kaa khandan karata rahaa he
 Iran says its uranium enrichment program is for peaceful civil purposes
 bharat kahata rahaa he ki iran ke khilaaf is tarah ke pratibandhon kaa vah virodh karata he kyonki isse parmaanu pratishthan ke bajaae iran ke aam log zyada prabhavit honge
 Russia and China, who have been opposing the sanctions against Iran, have supported the UN Security Council resolution, saying they are happy with the text of the resolution because it will not have any ill effects on the people of Iran
 iran ke khilaaf prastaav paarit hone ke baad turki or brazil niraash hai kyonki unhone iran ke saath eendhan kii adla-badali ke liye samjhaute kii madhyasthata kii thi or aashaa jataai thi ki isse iran pratibandhon se batch saktaa he
 It is noteworthy that three resolutions have been passed in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in the United Nations Security Council for sanctions against Iran
 pradhanmantri ne narendra modi mobile ap launch kiya he
 Daily activities of the Prime Minister will be available in this mobile app
 wo kya kar rahe hai, kisase mil rahe hai, vagairah vagairah
 
 
 
 aap google ke plastor se apane andrid phone par downlod kar sakate hai
 Through this, you will receive emails and messages directly from the Prime Minister
 man kii baat kaarykram kaa sankalan bhi hoga jise aap fursat ke kshanon main sun sakenge
 It will also contain information related to the Government of India
 aapse sawaal puche jaayenge ki kis yojana se desh main prabhavakaari badlaav aa rahaa he
 You will tick and the result will come like a survey
 is ap ko downlod karne se pehle aapkaa email khaataa poocha jaataa he
 With which you will be registered in a data bank and then you will start receiving messages of information and promotions of the government
 mobile ap main jo bhi soochna hogi wo sarkaar kii alag-alag bevesite or mantriyon-mantralayon ke twitor handle or fasebuk pej par hoti hi he
 The PMO also has its own website
 in madhyamon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie ki yahaan likhi gai baton kaa sansthaaon par kya asar hua or in sab upkarnon se sansthaaon ko lekar logon ke anubhav kis tarah se badale hai
 Not only the government, but the social media of all opposition leaders should also be studied
 tab pataa chalegaa ki ye saare madhyam logon ke bich apni maujuudagi kii ghanti bajaate rahane ke liye he yaa vaaki rojaanaa ban rahe janmaton ke anusaar, system main badlaav ke liye hai
 It should be seen whether it benefits the public or the leader
 akhbaar, tivi or naanaa prakaar ke vigyapanon ke bich soshal media ke ye upkaran ek or madhyam bhar hi hai
 In the absence of extensive research and understanding, it is difficult to say for sure
 magar in madhyamon main hone vaali samvaad prakriyaaon se guzarate hue lagata he ki ye paardarshee nahin hai
 The illusion of transparency is created
 aapako lagata he ki aap netaa ke sampark main hai, lekin jaise hi aap buniyadi sawaal karte hai, netaa usee tarah se chup ho jaataa he jaise pehle chup rahata tha
 In the case of Sushma Swaraj and Vasundhara Raje, people want to listen to the Prime Minister, but every morning one has to be satisfied with the tweet of pictures of his Yogasan
 unki mulakaaton or badhai sandesh ke twit to aa jate hai, magar yah nahin pataa chalata ki unki mulakaaton main kya hua
 For balance, you can say that the same situation is with Rahul Gandhi or other leaders
 bahut had tak patrakaron kaa bhi
 It is now more than ten years since the e-governance boom
 ab tak iskaa thos adhyayan ho janaa chahie tha ki kya vaaki i-gavarnence paardarshita he
 Has an institution's professional performance improved? i-garvanence se kuch maamalon main sthiti behatar to lagati he magar yah samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin he
 Passport Seva can be a successful example, but despite the railway ticket website, people do not believe that everything happens in a transparent way
 varshon se logon main railway ke tikat kii website ko lekar asantosh he
 Every railway budget has a number to launch to inform people, but this has neither affected the performance of the arrival of the train nor the availability of tickets nor travel experiences
 hamen yah sawaal poochna chahie ki agar i-garvanence paardarshita he to phir artiai kyon hai
 Why not every file is uploaded daily on the government website
 vibhageeya baithkon ke minutes website yaa mobile ap main kyon nahin hote hai
 If there was evidence of e-governance and mobile app transparency, then RTI activists do not have to attack every day
 unhen aavedan par aavedan lagaakar maheenon soochna ayuktaon ke daftar main chakkar nahin lagane padate
 Many times it seems that by providing few facilities in the name of e-governance, institutions are being undemocratic more than before
 hamane in sab sawaalon se takaraana shuru nahin kiya he, jo upar se kaha jaataa he ham use prasad ke rup main sweekaar kar lete hai
 The system goes behind the scenes more than any accountability is not created by e-governance
 kyonki aapako ghar baithne se kuch suvidha to hoti he, milani bhi chahie magar sansthaaon se saamaajik sambandh samaapt ho jaataa he
 You are just a consumer between supply and demand
 yah koi online shopping system nahin he ki paisa diya or kharid liya
 This is the government
 aapako jaananaa chahie ki faisle kii prakriya kya he or kin logon ko laabh hua he
 Therefore there should be a difference in convenience and transparency
 sirf soochna hi loktantr kii buniyaad nahin he
 The real information is not what the government tells as its decisions and figures
 i-gavarnence or mobile ap ke zariye sarkaar apni sansthaaon ke counter apane ahaate se hataakar aapaki jeb kii mobile main daal dena chaahati he
 If the line is not in the office, then what happened, who said that through them the line is over
 airport yaa railway stesan jaakar dekh lijie
 Go to passport office and see
 ye ho saktaa he ki twitor par rose apadet hone se puraani chizein neeche chali jaati hai
 So they can be compiled in one place in the mobile app
 nai sarkaar main aae din koi na koi website or ap launch hote rahete he
 It can also be seen in this way that the new mediums are becoming new mediums in social media
 in madhyamon ke bich pratiyogita bhi hoti he
 On one stage, you make yourself public and on the other stage you make yourself special by separating from others
 yahaan aadmi har vakt khud ko bheed se alag bataane kii koshish main rahata he
 The number also has special significance
 soshal madhyamon kii sankhya kii vishwaneeyata bhi sandigdh he par andeh karne kii kshamta aam jan main nahin hoti he
 Yet its number is how many are following or how many are tweeted, it is all through an impressive image
 tippaniyan There is already a Prime Minister on Twitter
 ve piemo ke handle ke zariye sanstha ke rup main bhi maujuud hai
 Now a new platform has come, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Mobile App
 koi kah saktaa he ki yah bhi ek kism kaa vyaktvaad he
 This will be a little easier because individualism is already there
 ho saktaa he ki baaki mantri bhi apane naam se ap launch karen
 You may not even
 mantralayon ke ap aa sakate hai
 Overall, such a circle of information is created that an ordinary citizen will not get a chance to get out of it
 wo apane aas-paas kii sthiti main bhale badlaav nahin dekh sakegaa, lekin abhaasi jagat kii in vaastavik soochnaaon ke zariye wo ek badale hue halaat ke bhram main jeeta hua khush rahegaa
 We all have a habit
 ham yah nahin dekhte ki yahaan kya ho rahaa he
 We want to see what is happening there
 pradhanmantri ek brands bhi hai
 Through all these mediums they keep changing their brand into different brand
 alag-alag naam se sangathit karte rahete hai
 Social media space is constantly filled
 bada brands lagaataar apni jagah badalata rahata he
 It keeps getting new from time to time
 bazaar main hi bahut puraane utpaada aise hai jo na jane kitni baar nayaa hokar launch ho chuke hai
 The Prime Minister is also a product
 isle liye nayaa, tazaa yaa pehle se bhi damdaar tagaline se launch hote rahete hai
 i am convinced of his energy
 ve na to khud thakte hai or na hi apane brands ko aaraam karne dete hai
 Whatever information will be in the mobile app, it is on the government's different websites and on the Twitter handle and Facebook page of ministers and ministries
 piemo kii bhi apni website he
 These mediums should be studied how the things written here impacted the institutions and how have the experiences of people changed with these tools
 sarkaar hi nahin, tamaam vipakshi netaaon ke soshal media par zaahir baton kaa bhi adhyayan hona chahie
 It will then be known whether these mediums are meant to keep the bells of their presence among the people or are they really for changing the system according to the public opinion being formed everyday
 dekhnaa chahie ki isse laabh janata ko hota he yaa netaa ko
 These media media tools are just another medium between newspaper, TV and various types of advertisements
 vyapak shodh or samaj ke abhaav main kuch bhi nishchit rup se kahana mushkil he
 But going through the communication processes in these mediums, it seems that they are not transparent
 paardarshita kaa bhram paidaa kiya jaataa he
 You feel that you are in touch with the leader, but as soon as you ask the basic question, the leader is silenced in the same way as before
 sushamaa swaraj or vasundhara raaje ke maamle main log pradhanmantri ko sunanaa chaahate hai, magar rose subah unke yogasana kii tasveeron ke twit se hi santosh karnaa hota he
 The tweets of his visits and congratulations come, but it is not known what happened in his meetings
 santulan ke liye aap kah sakate hai ki yahi haal rahul gandhi yaa anya netaaon kaa bhi he
 a lot of journalists too
 i-gavarnence kii dhooma ke ab das saal se bhi zyaada vakt ho rahe hai
 By now it should have been studied concretely whether e-governance is transparency
 kya isse kisi sanstha kaa peshewar pradarshan behatar hua he
 In some cases the situation seems better with e-governance but it is not a solution to the problem
 passport seva ek safal udhaaharan ho sakati he, lekin railway ke tikat kii website hone ke baad bhi logon main vishwaas nahin he ki vahaan sab kuch paardarshee tareeke se hi hota he
 For years, people have been dissatisfied with the railway ticket website
 har rail bajet main logon ko soochna dene ke liye koi na koi number launch ho jaataa he magar isse na to train ke aane jane ke pradarshnon par asar padaa or na hi tikaton kii uplabdhta par or na hi yatra anubhavon par
 We should ask the question that if there is e-governance transparency then why are rtis
 kyon nahin har file rozaana sarkaar kii website par aplod kar di jaati he
 Why are the minutes of departmental meetings not on the website or mobile app
 i-gavarnence or mobile ap paardarshita ke pramaan hote to aae din artiai kaaryakartaaon ko dhakke khaane nahin padate
 They do not have to travel around the Information Commissioners office for months by applying on the application
 kai baar lagata he ki i-garvanence ke naam par chand suvidhaayen uplabdh kara kar sansthaaon ko pehle se zyada aloktantric kiya ja rahaa he
 We have not started colliding with all these questions, we accept what is said from above as Prasad
 i-gavarnence se jitani javabdehi paidaa nahin hoti usase kahin zyaada system parde ke peeche chalaa jaataa he
 Because you get some convenience from sitting at home, you should get it but social relations with the institutions are ended
 aap sirf maang or aapurti ke bich ke upabhokta banakar rah jate hai
 It is not an online shopping system that money is given and bought
 yah sarkaar he
 You should know what the decision process is and who has benefited
 isliye suvidha or paardarshita main fark karnaa chahie
 Information alone is not the foundation of democracy
 asli soochna vahi nahin he, jo sarkaar apane faislon or aankadon ke rup main bataati he
 Through e-governance and mobile apps, the government wants to remove the counters of its institutions from its premises and put them in your pocket mobile
 line daftar main nahin he to kya hua, kisne kaha ki inke zariye line khatm ho gai he
 Try going to the airport or railway station
 passport aphis bhi jaakar dekh lijie
 It may be that old updates go down due to daily updates on Twitter
 isliye mobile ap main inhen ek jagah sankalit kiya ja saktaa he
 Every day in the new government, some website and app are launched
 ise is tarah se bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki soshal media main aae din nae nae madhyam ban rahe hai
 There is also competition between these mediums
 ek manch par aap khud ko saarvajinak banaate hai to duusare manch par dusron se alag kar khaas banaate hai
 Here the man is always trying to distinguish himself from the crowd
 sankhya kaa bhi khaas mahatv he
 The credibility of the number of social media is also doubtful, but the ability to doubt is not available to the common man
 phir bhi isaki sankhya ki kitne pholo kar rahe hai yaa kitne twit kiye gaye hai yah sab ek prabhaavshaalee chhavi ke madhyam to he hin
 The comments twitor par pehle se hi pradhanmantri vyakti ke rup main maujuud hai
 They also exist as an institution through the handle of the PMO
 ab ek nayaa manch aa gaya he pradhanmantri narendra modi mobile ap
 One might say that this too is a kind of individualism
 yah thodaa saral hoga kyonki vyaktvaad to he hi pehle se
 Maybe the rest of the ministers will also launch an app in their own name
 ho saktaa he ki na bhi karen
 App of ministries may come
 kulamilaakar soochnaaon kaa aisa gheraa banaaya jaataa he ki ek saamaanya naagarik ko usase baahar nikalne kaa mauka hi nahin milegaa
 He may not be able to see the change in the situation around him, but through these virtual information of the virtual world, he will be happy living in the confusion of a changed situation
 ham sabaki aadat hoti he
 We do not see what is happening here
 ham dekhnaa chaahate hai ki vahaan kya ho rahaa he
 Prime Minister is also a brand
 in sab madhyamon ke zariye ve apane brands ko alag-alag brands main badalte rahete hai
 They organize by different names
 soshal media kaa spes lagaataar bharta jaataa he
 The big brand constantly changes its place
 bich bich main nayaa hota rahata he
 There are many old products in the market itself, which do not know how many times have been launched and new
 pradhanmantri ek product bhi hai
 Therefore, new, fresh or already launched with strong tagline
 unki is urja kaa kaayal hum
 They neither exhaust themselves nor allow their brand to rest
 vyapak shodh or samaj ke abhaav main kuch bhi nishchit rup se kahana mushkil he
 But going through the communication processes in these mediums, it seems that they are not transparent
 paardarshita kaa bhram paidaa kiya jaataa he

 i-gavarnence se jitani javabdehi paidaa nahin hoti usase kahin zyaada system parde ke peeche chalaa jaataa he
 Because you get some convenience from sitting at home, you should get it but social relations with the institutions are ended
 aap sirf maang or aapurti ke bich ke upabhokta banakar rah jate hai
 It is not an online shopping system that money is given and bought
 yah sarkaar he
 You should know what the decision process is and who has benefited
 isliye suvidha or paardarshita main fark karnaa chahie
 Information alone is not the foundation of democracy
 asli soochna vahi nahin he, jo sarkaar apane faislon or aankadon ke rup main bataati he
 Through e-governance and mobile apps, the government wants to remove the counters of its institutions from its premises and put them in your pocket mobile
 line daftar main nahin he to kya hua, kisne kaha ki inke zariye line khatm ho gai he
 Try going to the airport or railway station
 passport aphis bhi jaakar dekh lijie
 It may be that old updates go down due to daily updates on Twitter
 isliye mobile ap main inhen ek jagah sankalit kiya ja saktaa he
 Every day in the new government, some website and app are launched
 ise is tarah se bhi dekha ja saktaa he ki soshal media main aae din nae nae madhyam ban rahe hai
 There is also competition between these mediums
 ek manch par aap khud ko saarvajinak banaate hai to duusare manch par dusron se alag kar khaas banaate hai
 Here the man is always trying to distinguish himself from the crowd
 sankhya kaa bhi khaas mahatv he
 The credibility of the number of social media is also doubtful, but the ability to doubt is not available to the common man
 phir bhi isaki sankhya ki kitne pholo kar rahe hai yaa kitne twit kiye gaye hai yah sab ek prabhaavshaalee chhavi ke madhyam to he hin
 The comments twitor par pehle se hi pradhanmantri vyakti ke rup main maujuud hai
 They also exist as an institution through the handle of the PMO
 ab ek nayaa manch aa gaya he pradhanmantri narendra modi mobile ap
 One might say that this too is a kind of individualism
 yah thodaa saral hoga kyonki vyaktvaad to he hi pehle se
 Maybe the rest of the ministers will also launch an app in their own name
 ho saktaa he ki na bhi karen
 App of ministries may come
 kulamilaakar soochnaaon kaa aisa gheraa banaaya jaataa he ki ek saamaanya naagarik ko usase baahar nikalne kaa mauka hi nahin milegaa
 He may not be able to see the change in the situation around him, but through these virtual information of the virtual world, he will be happy living in the confusion of a changed situation
 ham sabaki aadat hoti he
 We do not see what is happening here
 ham dekhnaa chaahate hai ki vahaan kya ho rahaa he
 Prime Minister is also a brand
 in sab madhyamon ke zariye ve apane brands ko alag-alag brands main badalte rahete hai
 They organize by different names
 soshal media kaa spes lagaataar bharta jaataa he
 The big brand constantly changes its place
 bich bich main nayaa hota rahata he
 There are many old products in the market itself, which do not know how many times have been launched and new
 pradhanmantri ek product bhi hai
 Therefore, new, fresh or already launched with strong tagline
 unki is urja kaa kaayal hum
 They neither exhaust themselves nor allow their brand to rest
 hamen yah sawaal poochna chahie ki agar i-garvanence paardarshita he to phir artiai kyon hai
 Why not every file is uploaded daily on the government website
 vibhageeya baithkon ke minutes website yaa mobile ap main kyon nahin hote hai
 If there was evidence of e-governance and mobile app transparency, then RTI activists do not have to attack every day
 unhen aavedan par aavedan lagaakar maheenon soochna ayuktaon ke daftar main chakkar nahin lagane padate
 Many times it seems that by providing few facilities in the name of e-governance, institutions are being undemocratic more than before
 hamane in sab sawaalon se takaraana shuru nahin kiya he, jo upar se kaha jaataa he ham use prasad ke rup main sweekaar kar lete hai
 The system goes behind the scenes more than any accountability is not created by e-governance
 kyonki aapako ghar baithne se kuch suvidha to hoti he, milani bhi chahie magar sansthaaon se saamaajik sambandh samaapt ho jaataa he
 You are just a consumer between supply and demand
 yah koi online shopping system nahin he ki paisa diya or kharid liya
 This is the government
 aapako jaananaa chahie ki faisle kii prakriya kya he or kin logon ko laabh hua he
 Therefore there should be a difference in convenience and transparency
 sirf soochna hi loktantr kii buniyaad nahin he
 The real information is not what the government tells as its decisions and figures
 i-gavarnence or mobile ap ke zariye sarkaar apni sansthaaon ke counter apane ahaate se hataakar aapaki jeb kii mobile main daal dena chaahati he
 If the line is not in the office, then what happened, who said that through them the line is over
 airport yaa railway stesan jaakar dekh lijie
 Go to passport office and see
 ye ho saktaa he ki twitor par rose apadet hone se puraani chizein neeche chali jaati hai

 It can also be seen in this way that the new mediums are becoming new mediums in social media

 yahaan aadmi har vakt khud ko bheed se alag bataane kii koshish main rahata he
 The number also has special significance
 soshal madhyamon kii sankhya kii vishwaneeyata bhi sandigdh he par andeh karne kii kshamta aam jan main nahin hoti he

 However, this decision will be taken only after Dhoni's retirement
 "paswan ne kaha, 'dhoni mere mitra hai, 'world fame' khilaadi hai, aise main unase bhaajapa main aane ke liye baatcheet hui he
 It is noteworthy that BJP President Amit Shah met Dhoni during the 'contact for Support' campaign before the Lok Sabha elections and since then there is speculation that Dhoni may join BJP

 The movie stars Arjun Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt, Kriti Sanon, Padmini Kolhapuri, Zeenat Aman in the lead roles
 multistarar film panipat main arjuna kapur kii casting logon ko sarprise kar rahi he
 Watching a film based on historical battle on Panipat is a fun concept for today's audience
 lekin film kaa trailor saamne aane ke baad se darshakon main niraashaa he
 Main lead Arjun Kapoor does not fit the role of Sadashiv Rao Bhau
 kisi bhi film kii safalataa ke liye lead actors kii casting kaaphi myne rakhti he
 In such a situation, taking the already flopped Arjun into the movie may prove to be risky for the makers

 Never before has he been seen in the role of a warrior
 trailor ke kai seens main ve ranvir singh ko copy karne kii koshish karte dikhe
 It would not be wrong to say that Ashutosh has played a big bet on Arjun in his most awaited project Panipat
 # arjuna kapur kii ghatiya actingpanipat kaa besabri se intjaar kar rahe phens trailor dekhakar kaaphi niraash hue
 There is not much buzz on social media about this film
 trailor main sanjay dutt ke alaava koi bhi kirdaar impressive nahin dikhaa he
 # Arjun Kapoor's falling starpower will be a loss due to the frequent flop films, Arjun Kapoor's star power has also been affected
 unki filmein kab relies hokar chali jaati hai, kaiyon ko bhanak tak nahin lagati
 Arjun's falling starpower is likely to have an impact on Panipat's business
 # panipat ko bachaa saktaa he ashutosh kaa diarectionpanipatake apojit box offis par pati patni or wo relies ho rahi he
 Kartik Aryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Pandey's film is getting more craze
 donon filmon ke bijness par verde of mouth kaa asar padegaa
 Panipat can benefit from Ashutosh Gowariker's direction and strong concept

 During the moonlight, the script kept on Sridevi's mind and her confidence was very strong at that time
 lekin phir bhi shridevi ne kabhi bhi apane staradam ke nakhre nahin dikhaae
 Why Sridevi was called Lady Amitabh, these are the three big reasons: Rishi Kapoor, saddened by the death of Sridevi, said that he never thought that he would talk about Sridevi in this way

 'and' Sheila's youth
 
 
 ' abhi bhi logon kii jubaan par tair rahaa he
 The war of excellence continues between the two songs and the actresses dancing on these songs on the silver screen in the coming year
 ek online voting ke nattejey ke mutabik 'munni badnaam
 
 
 'geet' Sheila's youth
 
 
 ' par baari sabit hua
 However, Kadradan of 'sheila Ki Jawani' also did not lag behind
 voting ke liye sawaal poocha gaya tha, 'inamen se kis abhinetri kaa item sang aapako sabase zyada pasand aayaa?' vikalp sirf teen rakhe gaye- katrina caff, malaika aroda khan or samira reddy
 Actually, the contest proved to be only between the two
 tisare kii bhoomika mahaj vot kaatane vaale ummidavaar jaisi rahi
 About 55 per cent of the people who took part in the voting 'munni Badnaam'
 
 
 ' par dance karne vaali malaika aroda khan ke paksh main vot daalaa
 'sheela's youth
 
 
 ' par qamar lachakaane vaali katrina caff ko 39 fisadi logon ne pasand kiya
 Sameera Reddy had to be content with just five-and-a-half percent votes and his bail seemed to be forfeited
 kai baton ne is res main 'munni' kaa palada baari kiya
 The lyrics of this song are such that they are easily climbed on people's tongues
 yahaan tak ki isamen prayukt shabd 'darling' bhi kisi ko nahin khatkata, kyonki hindi ne ise dashakon pehle apane andar samahit kar liya he
 Also, the name of such a pain reliever balm is also used in every household
 shuruaati daur main is balm ne bhi vivaad khadaa karke gane kii lokapriyata main ijapha hi kiya
 Sheila's youth on the other hand
 
 
 ' geet katrina ke laajawab dance ke baavjood 'munni' se peeche hi rah gaya
 It uses English words, which do not easily climb the tongue of 'bathroom singers'
 itane tathyon se is nishkarsh tak pahunchnaa aasaana ho jaataa he ki lokapriyata ke liye mahaj bhadkile kapade or 'sexi' shabd kaa istemaal hi kaaphi nahin he
 To woo people one has to grow closer to common words like 'amiya'
 ek sawaal ab bhi barkaraar he ki in geeton ne manoranjan zyada paidaa kiya yaa sabhy samaaj main rach-bas chuki 'shila' or 'munni' kii takaliphen zyada badhaain
 These songs provided another opportunity to fickle-minded people, whose hallmark gets mixed up in the news on the coming day
 ab tak to 'munna' yaa 'munni' ek naam ke alaava kisi bacchee ko pyaar se bulaayaa jane vaala sambodhan bhi tha, par ab surat badal chuki he
 Now hardly anyone can call someone 'munni' for this purpose, because Munni is afraid of being cast in the shadow of infamous infamy
 rahi baat 'shila' ke 'sexi' hone kii, to yah badalte samaaj kii us 'buland tasviir' ko hi dikhaata he, jo khud ko yon-kuntha kii jakad se mukt karne or sex par khuleam charchaa ko sweekrut dilwane kaa jhanda uthaae anjaane bhavishya kii ore utsukata se nihaar rahaa he
 There is an old proverb that friendship fluctuates and you should not regret being behind yourself after seeing your friend at high altitudes

 Asin settles a quarrel with two friends on UTV Stars' show 'superstar Santa', revealing that his close friends sometimes feel insecure about his success in Bollywood
 'gazani' film kii abhinetri asin ke doston main chah-saat ladakiyon kaa samooh he
 For Asin's parents, these girls are like their daughters
 ve ek-duje ke kaaphi najadik hai lekin apni filmi patibaddhtaon ke chalate asin unase zyada mulaakaaten nahin kar paati hai or is vajah se ve asurakshit mahasoos karti hai
 Due to this many times misunderstandings are created between them but Asin says that she resolves the matter before the matter gets out of hand
 vah sweekaar karti hai ki kai baar to unhone khud kii koi galati na hone par bhi doston se maafee maangi he
 This part of 'superstar Santa' will air on Sunday

 Aniket Parmar, who was suffering from death in advanced stage of cancer, had a dream of becoming a police officer, but this dream was not possible, because he did not have much time

 Actually, to fulfill this dream, 'make a Wish Foundation' had talked to the police officers, and after listening to all the talk, Ahmedabad Police Department gave full support, so that for a while, before leaving the world
 a child's dream was fulfilled
 
 
 darasal uskaa yah khwab puraa karne ke liye 'mek e vish foundation' ne police adhikariyon se baatcheet kii thi, or sari baat sunne ke baad ahmedabad police vibhaag ne puraa sahyog diya, jisase kuch der ke liye hi sahi, duniya se vidaa hone se pehle ek bachche kaa sapana puraa ho paaya

 ab sarkaar agle aam chunaav kii taraf bad rahi he
 In such a situation it becomes imperative to remember the promises of the government
 in vaadon main ek ahm vaada tha, naksali samasya kaa samaadhaan
 But on this issue, the Modi government seems to be far from its promise
 pichley chaar saalon main naksal prabhavit ilaakon main agar suraksha balon ne lagaataar karrwai kii to naksali bhi peeche nahin rahe
 He also targeted security forces and police personnel

 The promises made by the government regarding Naxalism were made during the elections
 unako puraa kiye jane kii baat to dur, is disha main koi pukhta kadam tak uthaae jane kii kavayad nahin dikhaai di
 However, the Home Minister continued to talk about the elimination of Naxalites on behalf of the government
 aankadon par najar daalen to kul milakar 126 jilon ko grih mantralay ne naksal prabhavit bataaya tha
 To deal with the Naxalite problem in all those districts, the Center made special provision in the budget

 Of these, there are 32 districts where Naxalite attacks have not taken place in the last few years
 magar 30 jile abhi bhi aise hai, jahaan naksaliyon ke haunsale kaaphi buland hai or ve apane mishan ko jari rakhe hue hai
 If you look at the figures of the Home Ministry, Naxalite attacks have decreased by 35% in the year 2017 as compared to the year 2013
 lekin kuch hamale aise bhi hue jinhone puri sarkaar ko hilaa kar rakh diya
 Many soldiers of the security forces were killed

 The martyrs also included a deputy commandant and assistant commandant

 As soon as this train arrived in their target, the Naxals detonated the IED
 naksaliyon ne javaanon ke paas se unke mobile, wireles set samet paanch insaas raifal or do eke 47 bhi lut lee thi
 Overall, if the Modi government is patting itself on the steps taken against the Naxalites in the last four years, then the above events show that the government has failed on many fronts

 The Special Economic Zones (amendment) Bill 2019 passed in Parliament last week
 yah vidheyak is baat kii ijaajat detaa he ki koi 'trust yaa koi sanstha' vishesh aarthik kshetra (SEZ) main apni ikai sthapit kar sakati he
 The aim is to increase investment, increase employment through macroeconomic activities and improve the infrastructure sector
 kya kahata he sanshodhan?yah vidheyak march, 2019 ke us adhyadesh kii jagah laayaa gaya he jiske jariye 2005 ke SEZ act main sanshodhan karke do shreniyan jodi gai thim- ‘trust yaa koi sanstha, athwa centre sarkaar dwaara adhishuchet’
 Now these two categories are also included in those institutions which have the ability to set up units in Special Economic Zones
 aisa mul kanoon main ullekith us vyakhya main sanshodhan karke kiya gaya jisamen vishesh aarthik kshetra main ikai lagane kii anumati ke liye kisi 'vyakti' kii yogyata nirdhaarit kii gai he
 Accordingly, any 'person' whether Indian or outside India, Cooperative so citi, company whether Indian or outside India, firm, local body or agency, privately owned office or branch , Association etc
 are eligible for this
 vidheyak kahata he ki trust SEZ main ikai lagane kii yogyata rakhte hai, iske alaava agar jarurat ho to bina kanoon main sanshodhan kiye duusari ikaayiyon ko bhi sarkari adhisuchana ke jariye joda ja saktaa he
 During the discussion on the Bill, the Minister for Commerce and Industry, Investment and Employment, Piyush Goyal told the Rajya Sabha that the government has received applications from eight trusts of reputed companies whose total investment is 8000 crores
 haalanki, ye kis tarah ke trust hai, inaki aarthik gatividhiyaan kya hai, yah spasht nahin he
 When the opposition expressed doubts about the amendment, Goyal told the House that till March, 2019, 20 million jobs have been generated from SEZ, investment of 5 lakh crores has come and exports of seven lakh crores have been done
 trust kii badhati sambhaavnaayentrust maamalon ke visheshgy or dilli ke charter acountint jagadeep gautam ke mutabik, is vidheyak ne sabhi tarah ke trust ke liye sambhaavnaaon ke dwaar khol die hai taaki unhen vishesh aarthik kshetra se chalaaya ja sake
 These trusts can range from health, education, skills and livelihood activities to production or finance
 SEZ maamalon ke jaankaar or vakil vishnu jain udhaaharan dekar samajhaate hai ki kaise yah sanshodhan niryaat ko badhayega
 They say that like Jali Yogpeeth, Baba Ramdev's husband, is a trust that runs from Haridwar
 ab yah vishakhapattanam SEZ se chalaaya ja saktaa he or ayurvedic davaaiyaan, cosmetics, food products aadi apane utpaadon ko port suvidhaon kii madad se baahar bhej saktaa he
 Incentives to 'business Trust' Business trusts have come into existence in India since 2014
 sakasham labhaarthi kii drushti se dekhen to bijness trust kaaphi ahm hai
 Business trusts are defined under the Income Tax Act
 bijness trust nimnlikhit prakaar ke ho sakate hai- infrastracchar investment trust, real estate investment trust, aisi ikaiyaan jinhen stock exange se manyata praapt he or jinhen adhishuchet kiye jane kii jarurat he athwa jinhen sarkaar ne adhishuchet kiya ho
 These are trusts which raise money directly from real estate and infrastructure related projects, like mutual funds
 ye buniyadi dhaanche ke vikaas ke liye privet sector se vittiya sansaadhan jutate hai
 However, it is still in its early stages in India
 gautam kehete hai ki security and exange board aaf india ne bijness trust ko SEZ se chalaane kii anumati 2016 main di thi
 The existing amendments to the SEZ Act 2005 will make the road easier
 vittiya kshetra main trust kaaryakari nikaay ke rup main behad aam hai, isliye is sanshodhan se trust hi iske sabase bade labhaarthi ho sakate hai

 Gangster Anandpal Singh may have been forcibly cremated in Rajasthan
 lekin uske encounter kaa baad shuru hua bavaal thamane kaa naam nahin le rahaa he
 The panicked Rajasthan government has extended curfew in Anandpal's village Saawarda till July 18
 udhar, jaipur main rajput sabha bhawan ladaai kaa akhaada bana hua he
 The angry Rajput society has called for a Rajasthan bandh during BJP President Amit Shah's visit to Jaipur from July 21-22
 iske liye rajput samaaj ke log jaipur kooch karne kii yojana bana rahe hai
 However, the police is trying to stop it under any circumstances
 police ne shanivaar ko rajput sabha bhawan ko chaaron taraf se gher liya
 Inside the Rajput leaders were holding a press conference
 jaise hi police rajput sabha bhawan main daakhil hui, vahaan bavaal much gaya
 The ruckus continued for about three hours
 aakhir main vivaad badhata dekhakar police peeche hat gai
 The police went to arrest the Rajput leaders involved in the movement here
 isse pehle rajputon ne elaan kar diya ki rajasthan band or jaipur kooch kiya jayega
 The movement will continue till the government accepts the demand for CBI probe into Anandpal's encounter
 rajput netaaon ne kaha ki saanvarda main log bhukhe-pyaase tadap pahe hai, lekin media ko bhi andar nahin jane diya ja rahaa he
 The Rajput leaders allege that the policemen involved in the Anandpal encounter have incited violence, so that the government which was about to send the CBI probe letter to the venue did not reach there
 rajputonka aarope he ki subah das baje se shaam 6 baje tak sabha shanti se chal rahi thi
 In such a situation, the police spread the rumor that the policemen have been burnt alive
 jabaki kahin bhi aisa kuch nahin hua
 Now on Sunday, the police has called a press conference to answer the allegations of Rajput leaders

 may 2014 main loksabhaa main bahumat paane ke baad se modi sarkaar centre main chaar saal puure kar chuki he
 During this time there was also a confrontation with the judiciary, a part of the Government of India
 modi sarkaar nyaaypalika se apane sambandhon ko lekar hameshaa charchaa main rahi
 Most of the time, there was a conflict between the government and the judiciary
 bharat main samvidhan kii vyakhya or shaktiyon ke bantwaare ko nirdhaarit karne kaa kaam nyaaypalika ke jimme he, aise main sheersh nyaaypalika kaa sarkaar se anban kaa rishta rahanaa swaabhaavik he
 However, this time the rift was more frequent
 kanoon ke jaankaar isaki ek vajah yah maanate hai ki is baar centre main sattarudh gathbandhan kaa pramukh dal bhartiya janata party apane dam par bahumat hasil karne main safal rahaa
 In such a situation, he did not have the conditions or compulsions of the coalition
 kai maukey aae jab sarkaar or nyaaypalika main asahmatiyaan dekhne ko milin
 Let us know how the relationship of both of them fluctuated in these four years
 vitt mantri or supreme court ke varisht adhivaktaa arun jetali ne 11 may 2016 ko rajya sabha main kaha tha, 'bharat kii nyaaypalika lagaataar vidhayika or karypalika kii shaktiyon kaa atikaraman kar rahi he or ab centre ke paas keval bajet banane or vittiya ke hi adhikaar rah gaye hai
 Step by step, brick is being extracted from the brick of the legislature
 ' vitt mantri kaa yah bayaan bhartiya sangh ke ganraajyon or nyaaypalika se takaraav kii kahani bayaan kar detaa he
 He was speaking on the demand for the formation of an institution to remove the disagreement between the Center and the states on GST
 puraane samay se rahaa he takaraavabharat main nyaaypalika ke sheershasth dhaanche ko sarkaar ke dabaav se mukt mana jaataa rahaa he
 Judgments have come against the Prime Minister from here
 1975 main elahabaad hai court ne uttar pradesh banaam raaj narayan cese main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii jeet ko haar main badal diya tha or unke chah saalon tak chunaav ladane par roak laga di thi
 Conflict over the appointment process, however, the collegium's method of appointment to the top judiciary has been surrounded by controversies
 modi sarkaar ne ise neshnal judishal appointment kamishan yani NJAC se riples karne kii koshish kii
 a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court in 2015 rejected the motion 4–1
 visheshgyon ke mutabik engeesi ke jariye sarkaar supreme court or hai court main niyukti kii kaman nyaaypalika se lekar apane paas rakhana chaahati thi
 After this there was a rift between the recruitment of judges in the government and the judiciary
 jajon kii niyukti ko lekar matbhed6 april 2015 ko mukhyamantriyon or mukhya nyayadhishon ke ek sammelan main piem narendra modi ke vaktavy se nyaaypalika or sarkaar main takaraav kii gambhirtha saaf dekhne ko mili
 In this conference, the Prime Minister disagreed from the stage itself from the perspective of the Chief Justice of the country
 tatkaaleen mukhya nyaayadhish ties thakur ne lagbhag rote hue lambit keson or nyaaypalika main jajon kii kami kaa zikr kiya tha
 After this, the PM who came on the stage said that the reason behind the pending cases is that the courts only take years to explain the weak laws
 modi ne nyaaypalika par aarope lagane ke andaaj main kaha, 'adaalaton ko five star activiston kii banaai gai avadharanaon se prabhavit hokar faisle sunaane se bachanaa chahie
 Even after this, Chief Justice TS Thakur was angry at the transfer of 2 judges and said that he would withdraw the judicial work from the judges concerned
 iske alaava unhone jajon kii niyukti ke liye nyaayik aadesh dene or piemo or kanoon mantralay ke adhikariyon ke khilaaf avmaananaa kaa cese chalaane kii dhamkee tak de daali thi
 Gopal Subramaniam's case: In June 2014, the Central Government sent back the Collegium's recommendation to make senior advocate and former Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam a judge of the Supreme Court
 isse naaraaz subramanyam ne apana aavedan hi vaapis le liya tha
 The Supreme Court was then closed during the summer holidays
 isse niraash tatkaaleen sijeai aaram lodha ne kaha tha ki subramanyam ko supreme court ke khulne kaa intjaar karnaa chahie tha
 Because if the collegium had then sent Subramanian's name to the government, the government would have to approve it
 aapako bataa den ki subramanyam soharabuddin encounter cese main nyaay mitra the or unhone nae sabooton ke saath tatkaaleen narendra modi kii gujarat sarkaar par gambhir aarope lagaae the
 Subsequently, the Supreme Court ordered a CBI inquiry into the case
 uttarakhand-arunachal main raashtrapati shashankentre sarkaar ko supreme court se ek or jhatka uttarakhand or arunachal pradesh main raashtrapati shashan lagu karne ke maamle main mila
 Both the states had Congress governments, where the government was reduced to a minority and President's rule was imposed
 teen maheene ke andar do aise maamle saamne aane par supreme court ne rajyapal par tippanee kii ki unhen yaad rakhana chahie ki vah janata ke chune hue pratinidhi nahin hai
 Therefore, he cannot take power without consulting the Chief Minister and his Council of Ministers
 saath hi court ne spasht kiya ki agar sarkaar alpamat main he to rajyapal ko floor test karwaakar report raashtrapati ko bhejni chahie
 In any case, the Governor will have to seek the advice of the Chief Minister
 court ne ye tippaniyan july 2016 main arunachal pradesh ke maamle main kin
 The Supreme Court's interference in the operation of BCCI v
 Supreme Court BCCI can also be countered in the confrontation between the government and the judiciary
 supreme court ne purv sijeai justise lodha kii adhyakshata main bani cameti kii siforeeshon ko bisisiai main lagu karne ko lekar bharat kii is sheersh cricket prashaasak sanstha ko kadi fatkaar lagaai or kaha tha, 'sudhar jaao, varna ham aapako sudhaarenge
 The court warned BJP leader Anurag Thakur to send him to jail after he was stuck in judicial reforms, when Thakur left the post of BCCI president
 iske alaava sibiai diarector rakesh asthana kii niyukti ko bhi supreme court main chunauti di gai
 Four other senior judges of the Supreme Court were openly against the Chief Justice of the country in 2018, in the case related to Chief Justice vs
 other judges' confrontation with the judiciary
 justise jasti chelmeshwar, justise ranjan gogai, justise madan lokur or justise courian joseph ne press conference kar sijeai deepak mishra kii prashasanamak gatividhiyon par sawaal uthaae
 He said that it is his responsibility to tell what is going wrong in the Supreme Court
 in jajon ne kaha ki ve sijeai ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin chaahate hai
 Senior Supreme Court advocate Prashant Bhushan accused the Chief Justice of taking steps that would benefit the central government
 jaj loya kii maut kii sunwyeesupreme court ke chaar varisht jajon kii press conference jaj biech loya kii aprakritik or rahasyamayi maut kii sunwaayee se thik pehle hui thi
 The hearing of this case was given to the junior judge by ignoring the senior judges
 ise bhi jajon kii naaraazgi kii vajah bataaya gaya
 The four judges also wrote in their letter that on several occasions the CJI decided the bench in its choice and irrationally while making the roster
 justise joseph kaa maamlasaal 2018 main modi sarkaar or nyaaypalika ke bich tanatani ke kai maamle dekhne ko mili
 The latest case is the appointment of Uttarakhand High Court Chief Justice KM Joseph to the Supreme Court
 collegium kii ore se centre sarkaar ko justise joseph kaa naam bheja gaya tha, lekin centre ne varishthata ke ulanghan kaa hawala dete hue naam punarvichaar ke liye lautaa diya
 Let us tell you that in the case of imposition of President's rule in Uttarakhand, the Central Government was shocked by the decision of Justice Joseph's Bench
 centre ke is faisle kii ek vajah ise bhi mana jaataa he
 Governor of Karnataka in the elections for 222 assembly seats held in Karnataka in May 2018, Governor Vajubhai Vala administered the oath of office to him for the post of Chief Minister when the largest party BJP (104 seats) had less than majority figures
 Gave 15 days time

 That is, in this case also the role of the Governor can be reviewed by the Supreme Court

 a punished one 🙈 i was not allowed to go out of the house for many days, to interact with other “kids”, I’ve been told to be a good girl, to take my medicines every day and to keep a distance from crowded places
 Not that funny, I've got a contagious viral which kept me isolated in the house 🤦🏼♀️🙈😨 😂 i hvn't got it when i was a child so later on it just skipped my mind to protect myself against it
 These days we have vaccination against many of the contagious viral infections and not only
 Now I'm done with it, my health is fine, I've recovered but i regret i haven't taken it at the right time
 Lesson learned, now i will take all the required vaccinations to protect myself and i thought I’ll make u aware of it so that u stay safe and healthy

 chaliye thodaa bahut idhar-udhar or technical ishyu bhi maan len, jiske kaaran kisi ek par zimmedaari nahin daali ja sakati, lekin phir bhi koi ek to hoga, jo is gandagi ke liye zyaada zimmedaar hoga? But there is no sign of responsibility anywhere
 dibet ke program ne bhi ek ghante main vahi nishkarsh die, jo reporter kii 2 minute kii story de rahi thi or dibet main bhi chaahe kisi party ke netaa hon yaa patrkaar jo export ke rup main bulaaye jate hai sab ke sab bas yahi kah rahe the ki raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Those senior reporters above were telling me that Kejriwal is doing politics
 jab unki baat maine suni to mere man main 2 saal pehle kahi gai mere varisht sahyogi or hindi patrakarita ke stambh raveesh kumaar kii ek baat yaad ai
 Actually telling me in connection with an ongoing protest in those days
 maamla ek 5 saal kii choti bacchee ke rape kaa tha or police par maamla darj na karne kaa aarope tha, jisko lekar 'aap' or bijepi pradarshan kar rahe the or report ye kiya ja rahaa tha ki 'aap' or bijepi is mudde par raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Seeing all this and keeping in mind we were talking, Ravish Kumar told me that Sharad is very 'superficial' journalism
 are bhai in logon kaa kaam he, dharna dena, pradarshan karnaa to wo to apana kaam karenge hi to isamen kehane vaali baat kya he? gaharaai main jaakar reporting karo' Based on this conversation, my understanding was that if the political party is doing anything on an issue, then to say that politics is happening, all of this has no meaning
 are bhai polytical party to bani hi he raajnneeti ke liye
 If the leader does not do politics, will he give a lecture? Or will Pythagoras express his views on the theorem? samajhane kii baat ye he ki koi bhi mudda ek alag chiz he or polytical party us par jo kar rahi he yaa kah rahi he, yah alag chiz he
 And both should be paid differently, but what is happening today? Today it is happening that the issues are only in the name and the real focus is not on it but on politics only
 raajnneeti par focus hamaara zyaada hota he, lekin kehete hai ki ye partiyaan raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Every leader or political party has the right to raise their issues according to the society and the law, according to their own right, because the general public also has the right to elect or dismiss any party and that is democracy
 
 tippaniyan And our job should be that we should tell the public that the issue is this, whether it contains facts or figures and then tell that this is politics happening on this issue
 keval yah kah dena ki is mudde par raajnneeti ho rahi he, ye mere hisaab se duniya kaa sabase aasaan kaam he
 Before i go ahead, it is important to mention that in this article the events or events are being mentioned only to express their views and not to blame or blame anyone
 dilli or aajkal to isaki raajnneeti ko bhi cover karata hum aise main jab maujuuda vivaad yaa yun kahen ladaai centre or rajya sarkaar main adhikaar ko lekar chal rahi he to aise main ek din main sansad bhawan par ek varisht tivi reporter se mila
 When i meet a senior, it is my habit to discuss and discuss his current issues with him
 isse phayda ye hota he ki aapaki soch kaa dayera badhata he or aap us mudde kii gaharaai main jane kii disha main aage badhate hai or vaise bhi kehete hai na liya hua gyaan or diya hua daan vyarth nahin jaataa
 It is obvious that as soon as i met him, the discussion started between the politics of Delhi and the modi-kejriwal government
 is bich maine badi utsukata se un senior reporter se poocha ki aapaki kya raay he, maujuuda vivaad par? vah bole mujhe baaki sab to nahin pataa, lekin kejariwal raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 i said that everyone knows that he is a politician, he will do politics, but you tell me, whose argument and ground is strong in the demand that is being given by Kejriwal or the plea given by the Modi government? i want to understand this with you
 vah bole ki ye mujhe pataa nahin, lekin kejariwal raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 After hearing this, what will come in my mind, i will tell you further, but i did not waste their time talking to them and neither myself nor we both went on our own work
 ek doosraa mudda jo abhi dilli main chaaya hua tha nagar nigam kii hadtaal kaa, jiske kaaran dilli kooday ke dher main badal gai thi
 In all the stories, half-hour or one-hour-long programs i have seen on this issue, all of them have shown that who is responsible for this mess in Delhi? 'BJP - Are you doing garbage politics?' Or 'congress accuses BJP-AAP of politics' puure 10-12 din dilli main nagar nigam main hadtaal hui or dilli main khub gandagi faili, lekin isaki zimmedaari hi kisi par tay nahin ho pai

 Delhi and nowadays also cover its politics, in such a situation, when the current dispute or the battle is going on in the center and the state government, then i met a senior TV reporter at Parliament House one day
 jab koi senior miltaa he to meri aadat hoti he ki usase kisi maujuuda charchit mudde par uski raay jaanakar charchaa karun
 The advantage of this is that the scope of your thinking increases and you move towards going deeper into that issue and anyway, it is said that the knowledge taken and the donation given do not go in vain
 zaahir he ki main jaise hi unase mila to charchaa dilli kii raajnneeti or modi-kejariwal sarkaar ke takaraav kii shuru hui
 Meanwhile, i anxiously asked the senior reporter, what is your opinion on the current controversy? He said that i do not know everything else, but Kejriwal is doing politics
 maine bolaa ki are vah to sabko pataa he, netaa he to raajnneeti karegaa hi, lekin aap ye to bataao ki jo maang kejariwal kar rahe hai yaa jo daleel modi sarkaar ke hawaale se di ja rahi he isamen kiskaa tark or zamin majboot he? ye main aapse samajhnaa chahta hum
 He said that i do not know, but Kejriwal is doing politics
 ye sunakar jo mere man main aayaa vah main aage bataaungaa, lekin maine unase or baat karke na to unka samay jaaya kiya or na apana or ham donon apane apane kaam par chal pade
 Another issue that was still prevalent in Delhi was the municipal strike, due to which Delhi was turned into a garbage dump
 maine is mudde par jitani story,aadhe ghante yaa ek ghante ke lambey kaarykram dekhe sabhi main bas yahi dikhaa ki 'dilli kaa hua kooda' dilli main is gandagi kaa zimmedaar koun?' 'kya bijepi-aap kar rahi hai kooday kii raajnneeti?' yaa phir 'congress ne lagaae bijepi-aap par raajnneeti ke aarope' For the whole 10-12 days, there was a strike in the Municipal Corporation in Delhi and a lot of filth was spread in Delhi, but the responsibility of this could not be decided on anyone
 are bhai sidhaa bataao na ki iskaa zimmedaar koun he, vah bijepi jo nagar nigam par raaj karti he jis par nigam ko chalaane kaa zimmaa he yaa phir vah 'aap' jo dilli par raaj karti he, jis par dilli sarkaar ko chalaane kaa jimmaa he
 Let us also accept a little technical issue here and there, due to which one cannot be blamed, but still there will be one who will be more responsible for this mess
 par kahin koi zimmedaari kaa ata-pataa hi nahin
 The program of the debate also gave the same findings in an hour, giving a 2-minute story of the reporter, and in the debate also, whether the leaders of any party or journalists who are called as experts, all of them were saying this
 That politics is happening
 wo jo upar senior reporter mujhe kah rahe the ki kejariwal raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 When i listened to them, i remembered one thing of my senior colleague and columnist of Hindi journalism, Ravish Kumar, said 2 years ago
 asal main un dinon chal rahe ek virodh pradarshan ke silsile main mujhe bataa rahe the
 The case was about the rape of a 5-year-old girl and the police were accused of not registering a case, about which 'AAP' and BJP were demonstrating and reports were being made that 'AAP' and BJP politics on the issue Is doing
 to ye sab dekhte hue or dhyaan main rakhte ham baat kar rahe the to raveesh kumaar ne mujhe kaha ki sharad ye bahut hi 'satahi' patrakarita he
 Hey brother, this is the work of these people, if they protest, they will do their work, so what is the point of saying this? Go deep and report is baatcheet ke aadhaar par meri samaj bani ki kisi mudde par agar polytical party kuch kar rahi he to yah kah dena ki raajnneeti ho rahi he, ye sabakaa koi matlab nahin he
 Hey brother, the political party has become for politics
 netaa raajnneeti nahin karegaa to kya pravachan degaa? yaa pithagoras kii theoram par apane suvichaar vyakt karegaa? The point to understand is that any issue is a different thing and what the political party is doing or saying on it is a different thing
 or donon ko alag tarah se tavajjo di jaani chahie, lekin aaj ho kya rahaa he? aaj ho ye rahaa he ki mudde to keval naam ke hote hai or asli dhyaan us par na hokar tavajjo to keval raajnneeti par hota he
 Our focus is more on politics, but they say that these parties are doing politics
 har netaa yaa polytical party ko haq he ki wo apane hisaab se samaaj or kanoon se sweekrut daayre main rahakar apane mudde uthaaye apni raajnneeti kare kyonki aam janata ko bhi haq he wo kisi bhi party ko chune yaa khaarij kar de or yahi to loktantr hota he
 The comments or hamaara kaam ye hona chahie ki ham janata ko bataaen ki mudda ye he, isamen ye tathy hai yaa aankade hai or phir bataaen ki ye is mudde par ho rahi raajnneeti he
 To just say that politics is happening on this issue, according to me, this is the easiest job in the world
 jab koi senior miltaa he to meri aadat hoti he ki usase kisi maujuuda charchit mudde par uski raay jaanakar charchaa karun

 After hearing this, what will come in my mind, i will tell you further, but i did not waste their time talking to them and neither myself nor we both went on our own work
 ek doosraa mudda jo abhi dilli main chaaya hua tha nagar nigam kii hadtaal kaa, jiske kaaran dilli kooday ke dher main badal gai thi
 In all the stories, half-hour or one-hour-long programs i have seen on this issue, all of them have shown that who is responsible for this mess in Delhi? 'BJP - Are you doing garbage politics?' Or 'congress accuses BJP-AAP of politics' puure 10-12 din dilli main nagar nigam main hadtaal hui or dilli main khub gandagi faili, lekin isaki zimmedaari hi kisi par tay nahin ho pai
 Hey brother, don't tell me directly who is responsible for it, the BJP that rules the municipal corporation, which is responsible for running the corporation or the 'AAP' that rules Delhi, which is responsible for running the Delhi government
 
 chaliye thodaa bahut idhar-udhar or technical ishyu bhi maan len, jiske kaaran kisi ek par zimmedaari nahin daali ja sakati, lekin phir bhi koi ek to hoga, jo is gandagi ke liye zyaada zimmedaar hoga? But there is no sign of responsibility anywhere
 dibet ke program ne bhi ek ghante main vahi nishkarsh die, jo reporter kii 2 minute kii story de rahi thi or dibet main bhi chaahe kisi party ke netaa hon yaa patrkaar jo export ke rup main bulaaye jate hai sab ke sab bas yahi kah rahe the ki raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Those senior reporters above were telling me that Kejriwal is doing politics
 jab unki baat maine suni to mere man main 2 saal pehle kahi gai mere varisht sahyogi or hindi patrakarita ke stambh raveesh kumaar kii ek baat yaad ai
 Actually telling me in connection with an ongoing protest in those days
 maamla ek 5 saal kii choti bacchee ke rape kaa tha or police par maamla darj na karne kaa aarope tha, jisko lekar 'aap' or bijepi pradarshan kar rahe the or report ye kiya ja rahaa tha ki 'aap' or bijepi is mudde par raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Seeing all this and keeping in mind we were talking, Ravish Kumar told me that Sharad is very 'superficial' journalism
 are bhai in logon kaa kaam he, dharna dena, pradarshan karnaa to wo to apana kaam karenge hi to isamen kehane vaali baat kya he? gaharaai main jaakar reporting karo' Based on this conversation, my understanding was that if the political party is doing anything on an issue, then to say that politics is happening, all of this has no meaning
 are bhai polytical party to bani hi he raajnneeti ke liye
 If the leader does not do politics, will he give a lecture? Or will Pythagoras express his views on the theorem? samajhane kii baat ye he ki koi bhi mudda ek alag chiz he or polytical party us par jo kar rahi he yaa kah rahi he, yah alag chiz he
 And both should be paid differently, but what is happening today? Today it is happening that the issues are only in the name and the real focus is not on it but on politics only
 raajnneeti par focus hamaara zyaada hota he, lekin kehete hai ki ye partiyaan raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Every leader or political party has the right to raise their issues according to the society and the law, according to their own right, because the general public also has the right to elect or dismiss any party and that is democracy
 
 tippaniyan And our job should be that we should tell the public that the issue is this, whether it contains facts or figures and then tell that this is politics happening on this issue
 keval yah kah dena ki is mudde par raajnneeti ho rahi he, ye mere hisaab se duniya kaa sabase aasaan kaam he
 Another issue that was still prevalent in Delhi was the municipal strike, due to which Delhi was turned into a garbage dump
 maine is mudde par jitani story,aadhe ghante yaa ek ghante ke lambey kaarykram dekhe sabhi main bas yahi dikhaa ki 'dilli kaa hua kooda' dilli main is gandagi kaa zimmedaar koun?' 'kya bijepi-aap kar rahi hai kooday kii raajnneeti?' yaa phir 'congress ne lagaae bijepi-aap par raajnneeti ke aarope' For the whole 10-12 days, there was a strike in the Municipal Corporation in Delhi and a lot of filth was spread in Delhi, but the responsibility of this could not be decided on anyone
 are bhai sidhaa bataao na ki iskaa zimmedaar koun he, vah bijepi jo nagar nigam par raaj karti he jis par nigam ko chalaane kaa zimmaa he yaa phir vah 'aap' jo dilli par raaj karti he, jis par dilli sarkaar ko chalaane kaa jimmaa he
 Let us also accept a little technical issue here and there, due to which one cannot be blamed, but still there will be one who will be more responsible for this mess
 par kahin koi zimmedaari kaa ata-pataa hi nahin
 The program of the debate also gave the same findings in an hour, giving a 2-minute story of the reporter, and in the debate also, whether the leaders of any party or journalists who are called as experts, all of them were saying this
 That politics is happening
 wo jo upar senior reporter mujhe kah rahe the ki kejariwal raajnneeti kar rahe hai
 When i listened to them, i remembered one thing of my senior colleague and columnist of Hindi journalism, Ravish Kumar, said 2 years ago
 asal main un dinon chal rahe ek virodh pradarshan ke silsile main mujhe bataa rahe the
 The case was about the rape of a 5-year-old girl and the police were accused of not registering a case, about which 'AAP' and BJP were demonstrating and reports were being made that 'AAP' and BJP politics on the issue Is doing
 to ye sab dekhte hue or dhyaan main rakhte ham baat kar rahe the to raveesh kumaar ne mujhe kaha ki sharad ye bahut hi 'satahi' patrakarita he
 Hey brother, this is the work of these people, if they protest, they will do their work, so what is the point of saying this? Go deep and report is baatcheet ke aadhaar par meri samaj bani ki kisi mudde par agar polytical party kuch kar rahi he to yah kah dena ki raajnneeti ho rahi he, ye sabakaa koi matlab nahin he
 Hey brother, the political party has become for politics
 netaa raajnneeti nahin karegaa to kya pravachan degaa? yaa pithagoras kii theoram par apane suvichaar vyakt karegaa? The point to understand is that any issue is a different thing and what the political party is doing or saying on it is a different thing
 or donon ko alag tarah se tavajjo di jaani chahie, lekin aaj ho kya rahaa he? aaj ho ye rahaa he ki mudde to keval naam ke hote hai or asli dhyaan us par na hokar tavajjo to keval raajnneeti par hota he
 Our focus is more on politics, but they say that these parties are doing politics
 har netaa yaa polytical party ko haq he ki wo apane hisaab se samaaj or kanoon se sweekrut daayre main rahakar apane mudde uthaaye apni raajnneeti kare kyonki aam janata ko bhi haq he wo kisi bhi party ko chune yaa khaarij kar de or yahi to loktantr hota he
 The comments or hamaara kaam ye hona chahie ki ham janata ko bataaen ki mudda ye he, isamen ye tathy hai yaa aankade hai or phir bataaen ki ye is mudde par ho rahi raajnneeti he
 To just say that politics is happening on this issue, according to me, this is the easiest job in the world
 puure 10-12 din dilli main nagar nigam main hadtaal hui or dilli main khub gandagi faili, lekin isaki zimmedaari hi kisi par tay nahin ho pai
 Hey brother, don't tell me directly who is responsible for it, the BJP that rules the municipal corporation, which is responsible for running the corporation or the 'AAP' that rules Delhi, which is responsible for running the Delhi government
 
 chaliye thodaa bahut idhar-udhar or technical ishyu bhi maan len, jiske kaaran kisi ek par zimmedaari nahin daali ja sakati, lekin phir bhi koi ek to hoga, jo is gandagi ke liye zyaada zimmedaar hoga? But there is no sign of responsibility anywhere
 dibet ke program ne bhi ek ghante main vahi nishkarsh die, jo reporter kii 2 minute kii story de rahi thi or dibet main bhi chaahe kisi party ke netaa hon yaa patrkaar jo export ke rup main bulaaye jate hai sab ke sab bas yahi kah rahe the ki raajnneeti ho rahi he
 Those senior reporters above were telling me that Kejriwal is doing politics
 jab unki baat maine suni to mere man main 2 saal pehle kahi gai mere varisht sahyogi or hindi patrakarita ke stambh raveesh kumaar kii ek baat yaad ai
 Actually telling me in connection with an ongoing protest in those days
 maamla ek 5 saal kii choti bacchee ke rape kaa tha or police par maamla darj na karne kaa aarope tha, jisko lekar 'aap' or bijepi pradarshan kar rahe the or report ye kiya ja rahaa tha ki 'aap' or bijepi is mudde par raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Seeing all this and keeping in mind we were talking, Ravish Kumar told me that Sharad is very 'superficial' journalism
 are bhai in logon kaa kaam he, dharna dena, pradarshan karnaa to wo to apana kaam karenge hi to isamen kehane vaali baat kya he? gaharaai main jaakar reporting karo' Based on this conversation, my understanding was that if the political party is doing anything on an issue, then to say that politics is happening, all of this has no meaning
 are bhai polytical party to bani hi he raajnneeti ke liye
 If the leader does not do politics, will he give a lecture? Or will Pythagoras express his views on the theorem? samajhane kii baat ye he ki koi bhi mudda ek alag chiz he or polytical party us par jo kar rahi he yaa kah rahi he, yah alag chiz he
 And both should be paid differently, but what is happening today? Today it is happening that the issues are only in the name and the real focus is not on it but on politics only
 raajnneeti par focus hamaara zyaada hota he, lekin kehete hai ki ye partiyaan raajnneeti kar rahi hai
 Every leader or political party has the right to raise their issues according to the society and the law, according to their own right, because the general public also has the right to elect or dismiss any party and that is democracy
 
 tippaniyan And our job should be that we should tell the public that the issue is this, whether it contains facts or figures and then tell that this is politics happening on this issue
