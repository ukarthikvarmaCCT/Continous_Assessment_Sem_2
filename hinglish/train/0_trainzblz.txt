 Let's take a look at the very interesting electoral riots growing day by day and try to find out who is that special face whose election results will be seen by us somewhere
 1
 Kiran Bedi: Kiran Bedi's name is not an identity
 purv ipies officer or samajasevi raheen kiran bedi saarvajanik jivan main sakriy he
 Later she was also associated with Anna movement
 apane kariyar ke dauraan bhi kaaphi nidar or bemauf maani jane vaali kiran bedi apni balaat swabhaav ke liye kaaphi mashhoor rahi hai
 
 
 
 or unki isi aayran ladi ke image bijepi khub bhunaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 The BJP has appointed Kiran Bedi to the post of Chief Minister, bypassing all the old leaders, but apart from winning her own seat at the head of Bedi, she has a dual desire to establish herself as an alternative to Kejriwal among the people of Delhi
 Responsibility
 2
 Arvind Kejriwal: Former IRS officer, RTI activist and coordinator of India Against Corruption Campaign, Arvind Kejriwal has also been the Chief Minister of Delhi
 arvind kejariwal kii pahchaan is baat se hi saafe hoti he ki bijepi ko unke khilaaf, unki hi party kii purv sahyogi kiran bedi ko maidan main laana padaa
 Kejriwal has committed a major political mistake by resigning from the power of Delhi last time, he has the responsibility to win back the trust of the people of Delhi
 agar wo aisa nahin kar pate hai to aage shaayad unhen phir shunya se shuruyaat kerani pad sakati he
 3
 nupur sharma: dilli vishvavidhyalay chaatr union kii purv adhyaksh noopur sharma ko ummidavaar banaaya he
 Nupur Sharma has been the President of Delhi University Students' Union and studied at the London School of Economics
 nupur ke mutabik raajnneeti main unka anubhav arvind kejariwal se juyada he
 If Nupur can compete with Kejriwal at all, then his status in the party will only get better in the coming days
 4
 Manish Sisodia: Aam Aadmi Party candidate from Patparganj has a very important place in Aam Aadmi Party
 wo kejariwal ke baad ve party main number do ke netaa maane jate hai or kejariwal ke kareebi bhi
 Manish Sisodia is one of the few people who have supported the Aam Aadmi Party from the first day and with full strength
 haalanki is chunaav main manish sisodiya ko pane hi purv saathi vinod kumaar binni kii chunauti milane ja rahi he, jinka janaadhar bhi acha mana jaataa he
 This comparison will not be easy for Sisodia
 5
 Jagdish Mukhi: Senior leader of Bharatiya Janata Party Jagdish Mukhi is in the fray again in Janakpuri seat
 mukhi isse pehle bhi janakapuri se chune ja chuke hai lekin is baar unke saamne khadey hai unke apane hi damaad suresh kumaar jinhen congress ne apana ummidavaar banaaya he
 How Jagdish Mukhi will face this challenge from home is a matter to be seen
 6
 Sharmistha Mukherjee: The election of Greater Kailash is going to be quite interesting this time
 bagaiyr kisi aahat ke congress ne is seat se raashtrapati pranab mukherjee kii beti sharmishtha mukherjee ko chunaav maidan main utaara he
 a tough challenge to Sharmistha will be against Saurabh Bhardwaj of AAP who won the last election
 bijepi ne abhi is seat se apane ummidavaar kii ghoshnaa nahin kii he
 7
 ajay maakan : congress ne dilli chunaav kii zimmedaari is baar apane yuva or vishwaasapaatr chehre ajay maakan ko di he
 Ajay has also been a minister in Delhi and the central government earlier
 unhen rahul gandhi kaa kareebi bhi mana jaataa he
 Along with campaigning, Maken also has the responsibility of leadership, so if Maken is able to win his seat and get a respectable lead to the party, then it will definitely affect his importance in the Congress

 Lewis completed FIFTY in 19 balls, which is the fastest FIFTY of CPL
 unhone colin munro or darren saimi ke 23-23 gendon main fifty ke record ko todaa

 This is the last day of the rjd's ultimatum on the sharing of seats between the Grand Alliance in Bihar
 congress sahit sabhi dalon ke bich abhi seat shering kii ghoshnaa nahin hui he
 However, in the midst of all this, the seat-sharing formula in the Grand Alliance is almost ready
 mana ja rahaa he ki argedy or congress sahit sahyogi dalon ko ek-ek kadam peeche khinchne pad sakate hai
 The Grand Alliance in Bihar includes RJD, Congress, RLSP, Hindustan Awam Morcha, Vikas Insan Party, Loktantrik Janata Dal and Left Party
 sutron kii maane to bihar kii kul 40 loksabhaa siton main se argedy ko 20-22 siten mil sakati he
 While Congress can get 10-11 seats, RLSP can get 3 to 4 seats, Jitan Ram Manjhi's party Hindustan Awam Morcha can get 1-2 seats and vips can get 1 to 2 seats
 vahiin, sharad yadav kii party loktantric janata dal ko ek or left ko ek seat die jane kaa formula ban rahaa he
 In fact, the seat of the seat is stuck between the Congress and the RJD in the Grand Alliance in Bihar
 isi ke chalate abhi tak siton ke bantwaaron kii ghoshnaa nahin ho sakati he
 With seats in the Mahagathbandhan, there is a storm from Patna to Delhi

 RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav wants to keep Mukesh Sahni with him to help the Nishad voters of Bihar
 saahani kii nishad matadaataaon ke bich majboot aadhaar ko dekhte hue unki party viipi ko mahagathbandhan kaa hissaa banaaya
 Mukesh Sahni is asking for the Darbhanga seat in Bihar, but Kirti Azad, who left the BJP and joined the Congress, is an MP from this seat
 aise main congress bhi isi seat par daawa kar rahi he
 In such a situation, now there is a strategy to help Sahni's party by giving it to Muzaffarpur and Khagaria
 jabaki argedy ke khate main 20 se 22 siten mil sakati hai
 Among them, claims on Khagaria, Pataliputra, Buxar, Jehanabad, Gaya, Madhubani, Jhanjharpur, Vaishali, Siwan, Maharajganj, Saran, Ujiarpur and Jamui seats are considered strong
 iske alaava arriya, madhepura, baankaa or bhagalpur kii siton bhi argedy ko milanaa tay he, kyonki 2014 main in siton par argedy ko jeet mili thim
 In Bihar, Congress is believed that Katihar, Sasaram, Samastipur, Aurangabad, Kishanganj, Supaul, Muzaffarpur, Munger, Shivhar, Hajipur and Patna Sahib seats can be found
 haalanki mujffarpur dekar congress darbhanga seat maang rahi he
 At the same time, Upendra Kushwaha, who left the NDA and joined the Mahagathbandhan, can get Karakat, East Champaran and Valmikinagar seats

 This is much less than the announcements that usually occur each year
 rail mantri suresh prabhu ko sudhaar samarthak mana jaataa he
 It is believed that Prabhurale will not announce more new trains in the budget, despite the demand of many states, because of the lack of funds, the railways have been stuck for many years
 aamtaur par rail bajet main har saal 150 se 180 nai trainon kii ghoshnaa hoti he

 After assessing the profit loss of not announcing more new trains in the Rail Budget, the revised proposal has now been pushed forward

 Apart from this, branding of some trains can also be done to raise additional funds
 prastaav ke anusaar in nai trainon par kuch lokapriy brandon ke vigyaapan lage honge
 They can also be named as Coca Cola Express or Haldiram Express etc
 iske alaava rail bajet main kuch lokapriy margon par duusari shrenee ke kochon ke saath kuch anarakshit trainon jaise ‘jan saadhaaran express’ aadi kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 This offer can be extended to the common man for cheaper travel

 The acquisition of a set of about 20 trains can also be proposed in the Rail Budget

 In view of the assembly elections in Bihar, trains may be announced there
 iske alaava purvottar ke liye bhi nai trainon kii ghoshnaa ho sakati he
 It is believed that efforts will be made to establish regional balance with the announcement of new trains for states like Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bengal and Gujarat

 co / dbozfekle9— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 23, 2017 loksabhaa chunaav ke antim charan se pehle 13 may ko samaajawaadee party (sapa), bahujan samaaj party (basapa) or rashtriya lokdal (ralod) gathbandhan kii raily gorakhpur ke champa devi park main thi
 The BSP national president Mayawati had probably realized the challenge the coalition faced in the first six phase elections
 mayawati boleen, ''agar gathbandhan ke log ek duusare kaa vot transfar kara denge to pradhanmantri narendra modi kii chuttee ho jaaegi
 Mayawati's apprehension about vote transfer did not prove to be unbearable
 nateezon ke din 23 may ko yah saaf ho gaya ki gathbandhan ke ghatak dalon kaa puraa vot ek-duusare ko transfar nahin hua
 The coalition could only get a little over 39 percent of the vote, much less than the SP, BSP and RLD alliance's total votes in the 2017 assembly elections and 2014 Lok Sabha elections (see graphics)
 vot transfar na hone kaa asar sapa ke garh vaali loksabhaa siton par saaf dikhaa
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the candidate from Mainpuri and SP Patron Mulayam Singh Yadav defeated the BJP candidate by more than three and a half lakh votes with 55 per cent votes
 us chunaav main basapa ummidavaar ko 1
 42 lakh votes were received
 is baar chunaav main sapa-basapa ke paraspar virdohi maton ko ekajute karne ke liye hi 19 april ko mayawati or mulaayam singh yadav ne 24 saal baad mainpuri main gathbandhan kii raily main manch saajha kiya tha
 Despite this, the traditional Yadav and Dalit (especially Jatav) voters of the SP and BSP remained hesitant
 mulaayam ko 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav se 70,000 vot kam mili
 Mulayam, who won last time with three and a half lakh votes, could win this election with barely 94 thousand votes
 yadav belt kii loksabhaa seat kannauj se sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh akhilesh yadav kii patni tathaa kannauj kii purv saansad dimple yadav maidan main thim
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Dimple won only 20 thousand votes over BJP candidate Subrata Pathak
 haalanki 2014 ke chunaav main basapa ko 1
 27 lakh votes were received
 is baar kannauj main 25 april kii jansabha main manch par mayawati ke pair chhukar dimple ne sapa-basapa ke samarthakon ko ekajutata kaa sandesh diya tha
 Dimple's effort did not bring color
 dimple keval 60 hajaar vot adhik le pain
 The BJP candidate defeated Dimple by 12 thousand by raising 94 thousand votes from the last time, while NOTA got more than eight thousand votes
 mainpuri ke bhogaanv inter college ke pradhanacharya brijesh kumaar yadav bataate hai, ''musalmaan maton ke alaava sapa-basapa gathbandhan kaa paramparaagat vot jis anupaat main ek-duusari partiyon ko milanaa tha, vaisaa nahin hua
 This was the main reason for the defeat of the alliance
 ’’2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan ke ghatak dalon ne kul 42
 There were 66 percent Batorre and thus he was ahead in 42 seats in the state
 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mili mat pratishat (dekhen box) se gathbandhan 57 loksabhaa siton par aage tha
 With these strong figures, in 2019, the alliance was being judged stronger than the BJP
 lekin gathbandhan keval 15 siton par simat gaya jisamen basapa ko 10, sapa ko 5 siten hi milin jabaki ralod kaa khaataa nahin khulaa
 Dr
 in Lucknow bhimrao ambedkar vishvavidhyalay main raajnneeti shaastra ke associat professor susheel kumaar bataate hai, ''2014 or 2017 ke chunaav main alag-alag lade gathbandhan ke ghatak dalon ke pratyaashiyon ko paramparaagat maton ke alaava unki jati kaa bhi vot mila tha
 When the alliance had only one candidate in 2019, it did not get the votes of different castes in the previous elections with traditional votes
 isse teen dalon ke milane ke baavjood gathbandhan ke kul maton main kam se kam teen pratishat kii giravat hui
 The SP-BSP and the RLD alliance had come into existence with many challenges (see box)
 ek chunauti kii ore sanket mulaayam singh yadav ne 21 farvari ko sapa pradesh karyaalay main sawaal uthaakar kiya tha
 The biggest challenge before the SP-BSP alliance was to keep those leaders who were preparing for the Lok Sabha elections for the last five years
 pradesh kii aadhi se zyada loksabhaa siton par gathbandhan se naaraaz sapa or basapa ke netaaon ne duusare dalon kaa daaman thama
 Leaders like Kanpur SP leader Rajesh Sachan, who was close to Mulayam Singh Yadav, and a minister in the erstwhile SP government, and senior township leader Rajkishore Singh, joined the election by holding the Congress
 basapa netaa ramesh bind bhaajapa main shaamil hokar bhadohi se chunaav lade or jite
 Ajit Kumar, a professor at BHU, says, "with a large number of SP-BSP leaders joining other parties, the coalition did not get a chance to increase mass base among different castes
" gathbandhan mukhya rup se musalmaan, yadav or jatav (dalit) jatiyon ke bharose tha
 The share of these castes in the population is close to 40 percent
 vahiin bhaajapa duusari jatiyon ko lamaband karne main kaamyaab ho gai
 SP chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary dismisses dissent in the alliance
 ve kehete hai, ''gathbandhan jati nahin, saamaajik aadhaar par bana tha
 By misusing power, the BJP took the people of the lower strata of the society by showing them various types of vegetable

 gandagi itani hoti thi ki idhar se guzarana muhaal
 But in December 2014, excavation of this mound located in the southwest of Telhada village in Ekangarasarai block of Nalanda district of Bihar has found many such remains, adding a new chapter in Indian history

 Anand Kishore, secretary of Bihar's Department of Art Culture and Youth, claims, "over 100 such items have been found in Telhada, which proves that there are remains of an ancient university in Telhada
" yahaan kushaankalin eent or mohren mili hai, jinke pehali shatabdi main bane hone kaa pramaan miltaa he
 It is worth noting that Nalanda is considered to be the fourth and Vikramshila is the eighth century university
 " rajya sarkaar ne bhartiya puraatatv surveykshan se isaki khudaai jari rakhane ke liye anumati maangi he

 The length of these bricks is 32 cm, width 28 cm and height 5 cm
 uske neeche 36 semi lambii, 28 semi chaudee or 5 semi oonchi inten mili hai, jo guptkaal main prachlit thim
 Below this, 42 cm long, 32 cm wide and 6 cm high bricks have been found, which correspond to the Kushanic structures

 Varma believes, "nalanda and the surrounding area was famous as an education center in the 7th to 11th centuries
" 35-40 kilometre kii paridhi main nalanda or udantpuri ke baad telhada vishvavidhyalay kaa astitv iskaa pramaan he
 Probably Telhada was the first university in this area, which later expanded into Nalanda University
 " telhada ko bhi turk akramanakari bakhtiyaar khilji ne nasht kar diya tha
 Excavations have found evidence of fire and a foot thick layer of ash

 This change could affect thousands of Indians living in America
 - america is samay kai sankaton se jujh rahaa he, iran ke saath ladaai, china ke saath trade war
 In such a situation, there is a demand of India that their trade war should not affect them and the concessions to India should not be stopped
 america iran se tel lene par roak kii baat kar rahaa he

 taaki america companiyon ko dikkat naa aae
 - America also wants that the companies associated with social media / internet of their country in India have to take a license, this demand should be removed

 Input: IANS uttar pradesh chunaav ke liye apane ghoshnaptr main bijepi ne anti romeo squad banane kaa vaada kiya he
 According to the party, these squads will be built to 'ensure the safety of college going girls' and to 'prevent incidents of molestation of women' and will be posted near the colleges
 bijepi ke puure ghoshnaptr kii jo style he, usase aasaani se samajha ja saktaa he ki party kaa nishaanaa kahaan he? chunaav ghoshnaptr main ram mandir, teen talaak or kairana 'palaayan' jaise muddon ko bhi jagah di he

 Is this a return to 'love Jihad'? The 'love Jihad' jumle was first used in Kerala and Karnataka in 2009 when it was alleged by Hindu and Christian groups that their girls were lured on behalf of Muslim youth They are married and then converted to Islam
 
 The jumla of 'love Jihad' was soon forgotten again
 2014 main ise phir suna gaya, khaas taur par uttar pradesh main, jahaan jati or dharm matadaataaon ke liye nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaate hai
 At the national level, 'love Jihad' made headlines in 2014 when a woman in Meerut alleged that she was gangraped in a madrasa in Muzaffarnagar and then forcibly converted to Islam
 ye aarope bhi lagaaya gaya ki madrase main or ladakiyon ko bandhak bana kar rakhaa gaya tha
 
 mahila ke aarope lagane ke baad dakshinpanthi samoohon ne pratikriya dene main der nahin lagaai thi
 Dharm Jagran Manch, associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), launched a campaign calling on Hindus to 'fight' with 'love Jihad'
 uttar pradesh main 2014 main upachunaav se pehle aresas ne apane mukhapatron- panchajnya or organizer ke cover par 'lav jihad' ko jagah di thi

 Moral policing is now formal policing? The debate in support of Moral Policing has come to the surface ever since the BJP promised to form an anti-romeo squad
 hindutv kaa naaraa dene vaale kuch group phir se 'sanskari' bharat kaa naam lekar is mudde par saamne aa sakate hai
 In October 2014, activists of bjp's youth wing, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, vandalized a restaurant in Kozhikode, Kerala
 unka daawa tha ki restraan main 'aniatik gatividhiyaan' hoti hai
 a year later, a Muslim boy with a Hindu girl was attacked in Mangalore
 is ghatana main bhi dakshinpanthi kaaryaktaaon par shaq jataayaa gaya tha
 The recurrence of such incidents depends directly on the action taken by the police and administration on the culprits in such cases
 velentins de se pehle chunaav ghoshnaa patr main 'college jane vaali chaatraon kii suraksha' kii baat kiye jane kaa ek or asar saamne aa saktaa he
 This may give some organizations an excuse to become 'moral police'

 romeo kaa naam dene se pehle shakespeare ko kuch pard letaromeo ko shakespeare kii mahaan saahitiyik rachanaaon main se ek mana jaataa he
 In simple words, Romeo is a grief-stricken lover who did not get the chance to spend his entire life happily after marrying Juliet
 aise main bakheda karne vaale or gunda tatwon ko romeo ke naam ke saath jodna vaaki traasadee he
 Similarly, it is also wrong to give the name of Majnu to the boys of Flame
 party ko mahilaon kii suraksha ke liye banaae jane vaale squad ko romeo ke naam se jodne se pehle behatar hota ki shakespeare ko kuch pard liya jaataa
 Expressing concern over the slowdown in agriculture-related industrial sector, the leading automobile company Mahindra & Mahindra said that in the upcoming budget, the government should focus on increasing the productivity of the agricultural sector, not insisting on increasing subsidies to ensure maintenance Want mahindra and mahindra (automotive and form equipment kshetra) ke adhyaksh pawan goyanka ne kaha, ‘pichley teen chaar maheenon main tractor udyog main vikaas kaaphi dhimaa rahaa he

 Opposing the diesel tax, he said, "we believe that the government should increase the prices of diesel to market-based, encourage the use of diesel vehicles instead of petrol and thus reduce oil import expenditure
" kendriya moolyavardhit kar (senwatt) main do pratishat kii vruddhi kii sambhaavna ke bare main unhone kaha ki auto udyog ko ummid thi ki yah varsh 2011 ke baraabar hi rahegaa kyonki 2011 koi badhiya varsh nahin tha or 2012 bhi ek mushkil varsh prathit hota he
 He said, although we (auto sector) are not expecting any catalyst in this budget due to the tight fiscal situation, i would expect that there is no discouraging thing like increase in CENVAT duty in the budget
 goyanka ne kaha ki agar koi aisi vruddhi hogi to uskaa boj tatkaal graahakon par daal diya jaayegaa

 technology ke badhate daur par har cheez smart hoti ja rahi he
 First the phones became smart, then the speaker and not know what things including smart became smart
 isi chalan ke saath titan ne bhi apane wolet ko smart kiya or titan radar naam se ek wolet utaara
 If you use a wallet, then you will know how painful it is to lose your wallet
 kyonki aap isamen kai tarah card, cash or documents rakhte hai
 To avoid this problem, Titan launched its wallet with Bluetooth connectivity, which connects to the phone and alerts you as soon as the wallet goes away
 hamane is wolet ko yuj kiya he or ab ham aapako iskaa rivyuu bataane ja rahe hai
 The company has priced it at Rs 2,995
 yahaan jaanane kii koshish karte hai kya ye wolet paisa vasuul he
 Design: Talking about design, the unit we used for the review is black colored
 iske or bhi color aap company kii website par jaakar dekh sakate hai
 This is a pure leather wallet
 yani ise aap lambey samay tak yuj kar paaenge
 Its finishing and fabric is quite durable as well as stitching is done very closely here
 yahaan aapako card or cash store karne ke liye kaaphi cepereshan dekhne ko milenge
 The Bluetooth chip has been placed in the pocket on the right side
 jo sies chota he magar 5 rupee ke puraane sikke jitna motaa he
 In such a situation, you will not feel uncomfortable
 connactivity and fitures:titan radar ek bluetooth smart wolet he, jise connactivity ke liye bluetooth kii jarurat hoti he
 To connect it, one has to download the app of Titan Radar Bluetooth Wallet from Google Play Store
 uske baad ap main apni sari ditels daalani hogi
 To connect the wallet, you need to remove the chip in the inner pocket of the wallet
 phir iske cap ko remov karnaa hoga
 Here you will see a wrap above the battery, it has to be removed
 iske baad ap se wolet ko search karnaa hoga
 After this you will be added to the wallet
 ye wolet jaise hi aap range se baahar jaaenge to aapako ring alert degaa
 This wallet will display the last disconnected location GPS position on the app on the phone itself
 isamen bluetooth connactivity ke liye bluetooth lo energy (BLE) technology kaa yuj kiya gaya he
 It consumes low power
 wolet se phone ko karne ke liye iphone main kam se kam ios 9
 3 OS and at least 4 in Android
 4 kitcat OS kaa saport jaruri he
 Performance: The Titan Radar Wallet has a BLE (low Energy Bluetooth) chipset with a button battery
 company kaa daawa he ki single bydaree se titan radar ko 6 maheene tak chalaaya ja saktaa he
 Obviously we have not taken so much time during the review, then it cannot be confirmed
 baharhaal bydaree khatm ho jane ke baad ise riples karnaa behad aasaan he
 To use, turn on the phone's Bluetooth and pair the wallet with the app
 ap automaticali wolet ko detect kar legaa
 Talking about performance, i personally felt during the review that the wallet does ring alert as soon as it goes out of range
 lekin waapas range main aane ke baad isamen auto connactivity kaa feechar nahin he
 In such a situation, once you go out of range, you have to reconnect it from memory
 iske alaava acchhee baat ye he ki isamen aakhri discnect lokation kaa GPS pojishan miltaa he or aap yaheen ek clic par map acces kar sakate hai
 Apart from the problem of auto connectivity, there is a problem in this that once it was disconnected, we saw an error in reconnecting it
 saath hi isamen keval 30 feet tak kii hi range di gai he ise badhaayaa ja saktaa tha
 Verdict: We have occasionally encountered problems during connectivity during the review and the lack of auto connectivity features is a negative thing
 baaki ye wolet har maamle main acha he
 In such a situation, if you are afraid of losing your wallet, then you can invest money in this Bluetooth wallet of Titan

 kendriya sansadeey kaary mantri or congress ke varisht netaa kamalnath kaa kahana he ki agar congress ne mukhyamantri banane ke liye unhen mauka diya, to unhen koi gurej nahin hoga
 Talking to Rahul Kanwal in Aaj Tak's 'sidhi Baat' program, Kamal Nath said that if he is asked to become CM then he will definitely become
 kamalnath ne yah bhi kaha ki sarkaar pipul ripregentation bill main sanshodhan kaa prastaav isi satr main laaegi, jiske tahat kisi court se sajaa paaya hua janpratinidhi tab tak sadan main nahin baith sakegaa, jab tak ki ucch adaalat ne sajaa par ste na diya ho
 In response to a question asked on tainted mps, Kamal Nath said, 'the Congress party is not in favor that once you are punished by any court, you should remain a member in the Lok Sabha or in the Assembly
 iskaa jo amendament he, jo sanshodhan he, ham is satr main laaenge
 We are bringing this amendment to the Supreme Court
 kamalnath ne kaha, 'ham yah nahin kah rahe ki agar wo canvict ho gaya he, to wo jaakar duusare din loksabhaa main baith jaae
 There is a provision that he can sit for 3 months, but we are going ahead of it
 ham kah rahe hai ki aap baith nahin paaoge
 We are bringing this amendment that till you get a waiver, you should come from the higher court, when you get a waiver
 pehle jo kanoon tha supreme court kii jajment se pehle, wo tha ki aapane apil kar di or aap waapas aa gaye loksabhaa main
 In response to a question on the upcoming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath said, "go to the villages, towns, the general voter is upset about how he was cheated

 'alag telugana kii ghoshnaa par duusare rajyon ke bantwaare kii badhati maang ko lekar puche sawaal par kamalnath ne kaha, 'rajya kaa bantwaaraa doorgaami soch lekar kiya jaataa he
 This movement has been going on for 60 years
 hamane sab kuch soch-samajhakar kiya he
 Bodoland and Gorkhaland have been in demand for 15-20 years, but for 65 years there was a demand for Telangan

 'kamal Nath said,' Now political parties have agreed and decided in this, so what is the fault of the Congress party in this? The remaining states will be considered

 ' pichley varshon main sarkaar ne trainon main milane vaali khaane kii quality sudhaarney ke liye lagaataar prayaas kiye hai, lekin is maamle main kuch khaas badlaav hota nahin dikh rahaa
 It has been through all these measures that food has become very expensive
 kifayati daam main badhiya khaanaa lagata he ki rail yatriyon ke liye sapana hi rah gaya he
 It is expected that the Finance Minister will take such a big step in the budget this time that the quality of food in trains will actually improve
 baat sirf train main milane vaale khaane kii hi nahin he
 The quality of food sold at the stations is not improving
 yahaan tak khabaren ain ki kai train main khaanaa banane ke liye toilet water istemaal kiya ja rahaa he
 Apart from IRCTC, arrangements have been made to deliver food from several private vendors
 lekin yah vyavastha bhi kuch hi pramukh steshnon tak simit he, yani agar aapaki train kuch bade steshnon par he to yah suvidha mil sakati he, lekin baaki jagah nahin milti
 What's more embarrassing is that in the 21st century, we cannot even provide clean food to the citizens of our country! The interim budget did not discuss what to improve the quality of food available in trains
 Steps will be taken
 isliye ab is purna bajet se hi ummid he ki nai vitt mantra nirmala sitaraman is disha main kuch prayaas karengi
 The quality of food available from the pantry car has not improved significantly
 yahaan tak ki railway ne gunvattta badhaane ke liye khaane kaa vajan yani maatra ghataane kii yojana banaai
 It is proposed to reduce the weight of food found in many trains by 150 grams
 railway main pentry car ke khan-paan ko check karne ke liye har train main ek manager kii niyukti kaa bhi praavdhaan kiya gaya he, jo khaane kii gunvattta kii jaanch karegaa
 But it does not seem to have much benefit right now
 sieji ne mana kharaab he qualitysieji kii saal 2017 kii ek report bataati he ki trainon main milane vaala khaanaa tay maanakon par khara nahin he
 The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) supplies food in trains
 iarasisiti adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki uske dwaara parose jane vaale asal khaane kii keemat 150 rupee tak pahunch chuki he, jabaki use ek plate par 112 rupee hi milte hai
 While the truth is that the level and quantity of food that you get from the pantry car is similar, and the food of that level is found in a plate of 70 to 80 rupees in normal dhabas
 khaane kii keemat ghataane ke liye iarsitisi ne daal kii maatra main 150 gram tak karne or chikan kii jagah 150 gram boneles chikan gravi parosane kaa nirnay liya
 The condition of pantry cars will improve! Last year itself, the Railways had claimed that the passengers would get relief from the poor quality food they get during the journey
 isaki shuruyaat sabase pehle premium trainon main hogi, jiske baad anya trainon main ise lagu kiya jayega
 The claim is even that passengers will get food like airlines and will get similar service there
 jin trainon main pentry car lagi hai, unki haalat main bhi railway sudhaar karegaa
 For this, separate storage arrangements will also be made for cooking in the pantry car
 iske saath hi bartan dhone ke liye jagah banane par vichaar chal rahaa he
 Food will not be kept near the toilet
 Often you would have seen that in many trains, the food is kept near the toilet, after which it is supplied to the passengers
 is tarah ke food ke sankramit hone kaa chance kaaphi bad jaataa he or yatri biimaar bhi pad sakate hai
 There is also a claim that high definition cameras will now monitor the food items served on the train
 kul milakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki in tamaam prayaason ke baavjood trainon main milane vaale khaane kii gunvattta main bahut sudhaar nahin ho paaya he, isliye vitt mantri ko bajet main iske liye koi thos upaay karnaa hoga

 mumbai main kai mafia don vajood main aae, lekin ek naam aisa bhi he jisane mumbai anderworld ko ek nai pahchaan di or glamer ko anderworld ke saath laakar khadaa kar diya
 That name was Bahubali mafia smuggler Haji Mastan
 jo mumbai kaa pehla anderworld don kahalaaya
 Who was Haji Mastanhaji Mastan Mirza was born on 1 March 1926 in Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu
 uske pita haidar mirza ek garib kisaan the
 His family was financially weak
 kai baar ghar main khaane ke liye bhi paise nahin hote the
 The house was very difficult
 isi pareshaani main haidar nae kaam ke liye shahar janaa chaahate the
 But due to the trouble of the house, he could not leave the house
 1934 main mumbai aayaa mirza pariwarahaidar mirza ke ghar main halaat bahut kharaab the
 There was no cooking at home for two days
 tab haidar mirza ne aakhirkaar baahar jaakar paisa kamaane kaa man banaaya
 In 1934, he moved to Mumbai with his son Mastan Mirza
 vahaan unhone kai kaam kiye magar kamyaabi nahin mili
 He then opened a bicycle repair shop in Bengali Tola near Crawford Market
 dukaan khole kaaphi vakt biit chukaa tha lekin koi khaas kamai nahin ho rahi thi
 The 8-year-old Mastan, sitting vacant at the shop, used to watch the magnificent trains and luxurious buildings coming from the road
 vahiin se usne un gadiyon or bangalon ko apana banane kaa sapana sanjoya tha
 ALSO READ: Ten years had passed since he came to Mumbai to find the coolie on Bollywooddock still shaking this underworld don
 halaat abhi bhi pehle se behatar nahin the
 Meanwhile, Mastan met a man named Ghalib Sheikh in Mumbai
 use ek tejatarraar ladke kii zarurat thi
 He told Mastan that if he became a porter on the dock, he could easily bring out certain items in his clothes and bag
 jiske badale use paisa milegaa
 Mastan then started working as a porter in the dock in 1944
 vah man lagaakar kaam karne laga tha
 During this, Mastan began to befriend the people working at the dock there
 wo vahaan aane jane waalon se bhi dua salaam karne laga tha
 First step in the world of crime, in the forties, people from abroad used to bring electronic goods, expensive watches or gold, silver and jewelry
 unhen us saamaan par tex kii shakl main badi rakam adaa kerani padati thi
 This was the reason that smuggling on the dock was a profitable deal
 gaalib kii baat mastaan kii samaj main aa chuki thi
 He did not let this opportunity go by hand
 or gupachup tareeke se vah taskaron kii madad karne laga
 The smugglers used to bring gold biscuits and other items from abroad to Mastan and he would hide it in his clothes and bag and take it out of the dock
 kuli hone ke naate koi us par shaq bhi nahin karata tha
 In return for this work Mastan was getting good money
 padhenkidnaping king ke naam se mashhoor tha anderworld kaa ye dontskar ban gaya tha mastandock par kaam karte karte mastaan kii jindagi behatar hone lagi thi
 He was benefiting greatly from helping the smugglers
 1950 kaa dashak mastaan mirza ke liye mil kaa pathar sabit hua
 In 1956, Sukur Narayan Bakhia, a notorious smuggler from Daman and Gujarat, came in contact with him
 donon ke bich dosti ho gai
 The two started working together
 us vakt sone ke biscuit, philips ke transistor or branded ghadiyon kii bahut maang thi
 But due to tax, it was very expensive to bring such goods to India
 lihaaja donon ne milakar dubai or aden is saamaan kii taskari shuru kii
 In which both were making a lot of profit
 donon kaa kaam badhata gaya or mastaan kii jindagi bhi ab badal chuki thi
 The little coolie Mastan had now become the brother of Bahubali Mafia Mastan
 jurm kii duniya kaa bada namayun to pehle mumbai main varadarajan mudaliyaar urf wardha kaa naam chalata tha
 But he could not create a mafia don-like image
 kuch samay baad wardha waapas chennai chalaa gaya
 Now there was only one name in the world of Mumbai underworld, Mastan Bhai i
e
 Haji Mastan
 1970 kaa dashak aate-aate mastaan mumbai main apni alag paith bana chukaa tha
 He had achieved a big place in the ten-year-old Bhirt Mumbai
 samudra main uskaa raaj chalane laga tha
 Mastan had become more than he wanted to be
 ab wo amir bhi tha or taqatvar bhi
 He was very fond of wearing white designer suits and riding Mercedes
 uske haath main hameshaa videshi cigarette or cigar dikhaai dete the
 Aishoram had become the pastime of his life
 bollywood se tha lagaavamumbai anderworld ke raja kahe jane vaale haji mastaan mirza kaa bollywood se behad lagaav tha
 Old people in Mumbai state that Haji Mastan was a divana of Bollywood actress Madhubala
 vah usase shaadi karnaa chahta tha
 But this could not happen due to the situation
 phir madhubala jaisi dikhne vaali film abhinetri sona mastaan ko bha gai or usee ke saath mastaan ne shaadi kii
 Mastan invested in several films for Sona
 lekin unki filmein nahin chal saki
 It is said that Haji Mastan had friendships with Bollywood stars like Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Raj Kapoor, Dhamendra, Feroz Khan and Sanjeev Kumar
 kai badi bollywood hastiyaan aksar unke bangale par dikhaai detii thi
 Haji Mastan Mirza's name had become so big in the first arrest and in police Natmastakamubai that the police and the law did not matter to him
 1974 main jab police ne pehali baar haji mastaan ko giraftaar kiya to use ek viipi kii tarah tamaam suvidhaayen di gai thi
 He was kept under house arrest in a bungalow not kept in lockup
 khaane ke liye behtareen intjaam kiye gaye the
 For his sake, every need was taken care of which Mastan wanted
 police vaale bhi use salaam karte the
 Mastan was also used by policemen
 unhen mahange uphaar dena uski aadat main shaamil tha
 And if an officer did not listen to what he said, then he would get him transferred
 zarur padhensupari king ke naam se kukhyat tha mumbai kaa ye donindira gandhi ne bheja tha geldesh main apatkaal lagane se pehle kii baat he
 Prime Minister of the country Indira Gandhi also used to get news of Mastan
 mastaan ke badhate prabhaav se indira bhi pareshaan thim
 On his orders, the police tried to arrest Mastan Mirza at that time but he could not get caught
 lekin apatkaal lagane ke baad use giraftaar kar liya
 And this was the first time Haji Mastan had to go to jail
 bas yaheen se mastaan kii jindagi badalane vaali thi
 Mastan met JP in jail
 unke sampark main aane ke baad mastaan par khaasaa prabhaav padaa
 When Haji Mastan came out after 18 months in jail, his intentions had changed
 usne jurm kii duniya ko alavida kehane kaa man bana liya tha
 a large amount was offered to Indira a few days after going to jail during the Emergency, Haji Mastan offered the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi a large amount for her release
 lekin indira ne uske ofer ko thukraa diya tha
 When the Janata Party government was formed after the Emergency, about forty big smugglers, including Haji Mastan, were pardoned
 darasal, immergency lagane se pehle mastaan ne kai netaaon ko police se bachaane or bhaagane main madad kii thi
 Therefore, the Janata Party government had adopted a soft attitude towards it
 raajnneeti main entriakhirkaar, 1980 main haji mastaan ne jaraayam kii duniya ko alavida kahkar raajnneeti kaa rukh kar liya
 In 1984, along with Maharashtra's Dalit leader Joginder Kavade, formed his own party, the dalit-muslim Security Federation
 aage chalakar 1990 main iskaa naam badal kar bhartiya alpsankhyak mahasang kar diya gaya tha
 Bollywood superstar Dilip Kumar gave much publicity to this political party
 ve party ke kai kaaryakramon main dikhaai dete the
 This party of Haji Mastan later participated in the body elections of Mumbai, Kolkata and Madras
 bataaya jaataa he ki chunaav main bhale hi party ko kamyaabi nahin mili lekin is chunaav main kaale dhan kaa jamkar istemaal hua tha
 From there, the pastime of spending huge money in elections started
 na chalaai goli, na lee kisi janahaji mastaan mumbai anderworld kaa sabase taqatvar don tha
 But this powerful don did not kill anyone in his entire life
 kisi par hamalaa nahin kiya
 Not even a single shot was fired
 baavjood iske haji mastaan jurm kii kaali duniya main sabase bada naam tha
 At that time, the name of his name used to speak not only in Mumbai but also in Maharashtra
 haji mastaan jindagibhar mumbai main logon kii madad bhi karata rahaa
 He spent his last time with his family, including his wife and his adopted son
 or 1994 main heart atake se haji mastaan kii maut ho gai thi

 Was curious what Obama said
 obama ne kaha, 'logon ko ye samajhnaa hoga ki sampann logon kii sikudti taadaad or badahaalon kii badhati sankhya se hamaara desh kaamyaab nahin ho saktaa
 We believe that America's prosperity rests on the broad shoulders of the emerging middle class

 jammu kashmir ke pulavama ke arihal gaanv main sena ke kafile par somvaar kii shaam aatanki hamalaa hua tha
 Two soldiers have been martyred in this
 hamale main aatankiyon ne IED kaa istemaal kiya tha
 The armored vehicle of 44 Rashtriya Rifles came under attack near Arihal village in Pulwama
 report kii maane to hamale main sena ke casper vaahar ko nuksaan pahunchaa
 In a statement, the army called the attack an attempt by terrorists to fail

 5 CRPF personnel were killed in this attack
 duusari taraf, javaabi karrwai main surakshabalon ne ek aatanki ko bhi maar giraaya tha
 It is known that CRPF convoy was attacked in Pulwama itself in the last February, in which more than 40 soldiers were martyred

 Bigg Boss 13:tivi kaa sabase controvartial or sabase charchit sho 'big bos' (bigg Boss) apane nae sijan ke saath ek baar phir parde par dhamal machaane vaala he
 This time too, 'bigg Boss 13' will see new explosions and new controversies with new faces
 media reports ke mutabik'big bos sijan 13 (bigg Boss 13)' is saal sitambar ke ant tak shuru ho saktaa he
 But the most shocking thing in all of this is Salman Khan's fees
 darasal, media main ai khabaron se aisa mana ja rahaa tha ki salmaan khan 'big bos 13 (bigg Boss 13)' ko host karne ke liye is baar prayek hafte ke liye is baar 31 karod rupye charge karenge, jisase big bos 13 ke liye unki kul kamai 403 karod hogi
 But according to a report by Pinkvilla, this information has been proved completely wrong
 salmaan khan (salman Khan) kii team se jude sutron ne pinkavila se yah khulaasa kiya he ki bhaijan is baar 'big bos 13 (bigg Boss 13)' ko host karne ke liye kareeb 200 karod rupye kaa charge lenge
 However, this earnings of Salman Khan is definitely one step ahead of the previous season
 lekin jahaan pichley sijan main prati din ke hisaab se salmaan khan ne 11 karod rupye kaa bhugtan liya tha to vahiin, is baar yah aankada 13 karod rupye prati saptaah rahegaa
 Through this Salman Khan's earnings will be around 195 to 200 crores in the entire season
 bataa den ki salmaan khan (salman Khan) chote parde par sabase adhik bhugtan paane vaale celibrity hai
 Not only this, Salman Khan will also produce 'the Kapil Sharma Show' and 'nach Baliye 9' this time to increase his production business
 iske saath hi vah big bos kii team ke saath bhi milakar kaam karte dikhaai denge
 On the other hand, talking about season 13 of Bigg Boss, this time the commoners will not be seen in the show like the last three seasons
 iske saath hi is baar 'big bos (bigg Boss 13)' ke ghar main rashmi desai or jarine khan jaise kalakaar najar aa sakate hai

 He was leading a minority government, but this fact did not prevent him from undertaking the necessary reforms

 V
 narsingh raav kii aguai main congress party ko badi paraajay kaa munh dekhnaa padaa or loksabhaa main uski takat 232 se ghatakar 140 par aa gai
 The reasons for this electoral debacle were difficult to understand, as under pv's exemplary guidance, the country had come out of the balance of payments crisis and major economic reforms had been carried out
 haalanki pivi ko isse hairaani nahin hui
 Actually, he shared with me the possibility of Congress defeat before the election
 hakeekat yah thi ki shuruaati charan ke aarthik sudhaaron ne mote taur par bade logon yaa kulinon par asar daalaa or unke sambhavit phaayde aam logon tak pahunchane abhi baaki the
 After all, elections have to essentially govern the common people and populist appeal was almost absent in the work of the Rao government

 K
 gujral ne kii thi
 Deve Gowda's government was deliberately targeting the Congress
 police purv pradhanmantri narsingh raav sahit congress ke sadasyon par bhrashtachar ke aaropon main mukademe chalaa rahi thi
 The Deve Gowda government also once again dug out the issue of Bofors
 congress party aisi sarkaar kaa samarthan nahin kar sakati thi, jo uske netritv ko badnaam or pareshaan karne par amada thi
 Despite the fact that Gujral had been leading the Davandol Pachamel coalition since the beginning, he refused to accept the Congress' demand to remove the DMK from the alliance after the Jain Commission's results came out
 to, phir congress ne samarthan waapas kyon liya? yaa kesari jab baar-baar kehete the ki shmere paas vakt nahin haiy to usase unka kya matlab hota tha?kai congress netaaon ko laga ki yah pradhanmantri banane kii unki mahatvakanksha kaa sanket he
 On the one hand, they were trying to exploit the anti-bjp sentiments all-round, while at the same time digging the roots of the United Front government with the aim of elevating themselves as the head of a non-bjp government

 Hotness in Relations with Sonia After my active participation in the Panchmadi Conference in 1988, Sonia Gandhi began to consult me more often
 pehle hamaare rishte main jo nishchit tatasthta maujuud thi, vah dhire-dhire garmahat or ek duusare ke prati aadar main badal gai
 i believe that this neutral sentiment and not having a particular inclination towards someone is the biggest strength of Sonia
 isse hindustan ke siyaasi itihaas ke ek or ahm pahalu kii jhalak milti he
 Like other distinguished members of her family, Sonia too has embraced a true pan-india view
 aam logon tak pahunchane kii unki kaabiliyat or aam logon kaa unhen apni netaa ke taur par sweekaar karnaa hi vah ahm khaasiyat he jo unhen hindustan kaa pradhanmantri banane ke yogya banaati he
 There is no doubt that they could have acquired the other qualifications required for this position even after reaching power
 sharad pavaar pradhanmantri bananaa chaahate the1999 ke chunaavon se pehle is sambhaavna ke khilaaf chautarafa vidroh footataa lag rahaa tha ki sonia gandhi congress kii pradhanmantri pad kii ummidavaar ban sakati hai
 In my opinion, Sharad Pawar hoped that the party, instead of Sonia Gandhi, being the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, would urge him to put forward his claim to form the government
 bataur congress adhyaksh apni tarakkee ke baad sonia tamaam ahm muddon par sharad pavaar kii bajaae pi
 She used to consult Shivshankar
 algaav or mohabhang kii yahi bhaavana sonia ke videshi mul ko lekar unke bayanon or baad main 1999 main unke party chhodkar jane ke liye jimmedaar rahi ho sakati he
 Singh is indeed King when Sonia refused to hold the post of Prime Minister after the Congress victory in the 2004 general election, the possibility was generally being expressed that i would be the next choice for the post of Prime Minister
 yah sambhaavna shaayad is tathy par tiki thi ki mujhe sarkaar kaa bahut vyapak anubhav tha, jabaki manmohan singh kaa vishaal anubhav lambey samay tak afasarshah or paanch saal tak sudhaarwadi vitt mantri rahane kaa hi tha
 Some commentators in the media said that i would not join the government because i could not work under Manmohan Singh, who had been my junior when i was Finance Minister
 hakeekat yah thi ki main sarkaar main shaamil hone ko anicchhuk tha or yah baat maine sonia gandhi ko bataa di thi
 However he insisted that i should join the government as i would be very important for his functioning and Dr
 singh kaa sahaara bhi ban sakuunga
 It was learned that Drs
 singh tamaam ahm muddon par mujhase baat karte or mujh par puri tarah nirbhar jaan padate the
 We had a good working relationship
 bataur pradhanmantri unki niyukti ko lekar tamaam bahes-mubahise ke baavjood aarthik niti-nirmaan main manmohan singh se zyada tajurbekaar koi or nahin ho saktaa
 Why Pranab got the Ministry of Defense: Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh talked about potential ministers of Congress
 us silsile main sonia ne mujhe bulaayaa or poocha ki main in chaar mantralayon main koun-sa lenaa chaahunga
 His wish was that i take the finance ministry
 haalanki maine unase kaha ki manonith pradhanmantri ke saath aarthik nitiyon par vichaardhaaratmak matbhedon kii vajah se main nahin chaahunga ki mujhe vitt mantralay kaa kaam diya jaae
 i also told him that i would prefer home over foreign affairs
 i had worked more than six years as chairman of the Standing Committee on Home Affairs and was well versed with the ministry — and that i had no experience of the Ministry of Defense Was
 unhone mujhe puraa suna, par kuch kaha nahin or na hi koi ishaara kiya, sivaa yah kehane ki raksha apane aap main ek puri duniya he or meri varishthata ko dekhte hue raksha mantralay mujhe adhiktam swaittata pradaan karegaa
 At the time of the oath, i came to know that i have to become the next Defense Minister
 neval war room li ko sanbhaalanaabadakismati se neval war room li maamle ke pramukh abhiyukton main se ek ravi shankaran tha, jo nausena kaa ek purv adhikari tha
 He was also a relative of the wife of then Naval Chief Admiral Arun Prakash

 usne jaankariyaan hasil karne ke liye nausena nideshaalay main afasaron ke saath apane rishton kaa kathith taur par istemaal kiya
 Following this revelation, Admiral Prakash, following the true tradition of the brave soldiers, met me in August 2006 and submitted his resignation
 haalanki maine unki nekaniyati ke is izhaar kii tarif kii, par jab tak unke khilaaf koi pratham drushtya saboot maujuud na ho, main unka istipha sweekaar karne ko anicchhuk tha
 My decision was influenced by the principle that each person is responsible for his own conduct and that no criminal or improper workload of an accused should be passed on to his relatives unless there is contrary evidence

 Henry Kissinger was reprimanded
 When i became the Minister of Defense, i knew very well that India would have to reduce its dependence on Russia for its defense needs in the long run

 america ke saath baatcheet karne kaa vakt aa gaya tha or maine mantralay ko nirdesh diya ki pentagon ke saath zyada kareebi rishte banane kii disha main kaam karen
 Prior to my visit to America, i had a brief meeting and conversation with former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in South Block in 2004
 mulaakaat ke dauraan unhone america vaanijya mantri ron brown ke kaarykaal ke dauraan donon rashtron ke bich majboot vyapaar sambandhon kii baat kii or raksha sambandhon main aisi hi saajhedaari or majbootee na hone ko lekar sawaal khadaa kiya
 Answering his question, i clearly stated that the defense relationship between India and America has suffered due to complete lack of trust
 maine unhen behad ahm cryogenic saude ko rokane ke america faisle kii yaad dilaai, jo hindustan ke sarvocch rashtriya hit kaa sauda tha
 This pushed India towards indigenization
 maine unhen jawaab diya, ''agar america hindustan ke rashtriya hit ko sweekaar nahin karata he, to hamen aapke rashtriya hit ko kyon sweekaar karnaa chahie or zyada gahare raksha sambandh kyon kaayam karne chahie?" phir jaldi hi saansthanik tantra kaayam kiye gaye or america ke saath ranneetik sambandh sthapit karne kii hindustan kii ichha par jor diya gaya

 Bangladesh's two Begums defended Bangladesh President Iyazuddin Ahmed declared Emergency just before the elections (in January 2007) and Bangladesh's Chief Advisor, Dr

 During this time, many prominent political leaders were imprisoned
 shaikh hasina ko bhi ghoosekhori or bhrashtachar ke aaropon main jail main daal diya gaya
 Hindustan continued to negotiate with the Provisional Government, but at the same time we stressed the need for complete restoration of democracy through peaceful, credible, free and fair elections

 She feared that Sheikh Hasina would be sacked after her release from jail

 Sheikh Hasina had been a close family friend and when i was the Foreign Minister, Hindustan tried to help fulfill their cause by creating a lot of international pressure to conduct free and fair elections after the Provisional Government in Bangladesh
 darasal avami lig ke kuch netaa jab hasina ko chhodkar chale gaye, vah bhi tab jab ve jail main thim, tab maine unke is rukh ke liye unhen fatkaar lagaai or unase kaha ki kisi ko uske bure vakt main is tarah chhod dena aniatik he
 After all, general elections were held in Bangladesh in December 2008 and Sheikh Hasina came out winning with a huge majority

 In light of this statement of the Prime Minister, the Left parties accused us of turning away from the promise which i had apparently made — and withdrawing support from the UPA
 maine vam dalon ko samajhane-bujhane kii koshish kii or jyoti basu se dakhal dene kii maang kii, jo parmaanu qaraar kii khoobiyon se sahamat ho gaye the

 His open defiance of Jyoti Basu and the Bengal lobby was astonishing

 The indo-us nuclear deal could not reach its end without the strong synergy that my and the US Secretary of State Dr

 Not only this, my efforts to reach the government of Qianmar, known for its sharp anti-american stance, has helped American diplomats and tourists to make significant concessions and laid the foundation for a deeper understanding between the two democratic countries

 She was very concerned about its results
 maine unase kaha, ''haalat gambhir he
 i don't believe in romanticizing relationships or getting into any kind of adventureism, but there is a limit to patience
 ham sachmuch phikrmand hai
 "I also insisted that the US pressurize Pakistan to stop cross-border terrorism
 maine america ke haathon pakistan ko atyaadhunik hathiyaar or sainya sajo-saamaan beche jane par kadaa etraj jaahir kiya
 i vehemently refused to accept Rice's plea that these weapons were supplied to Pakistan with a view to stopping the threat of terror groups like al-qaeda and the Taliban
 maine unhen bataaya ki ye hathiyaar asal main bharat ke khilaaf istemaal kiye ja rahe hai
 i knew that time was the most important thing for our diplomatic initiative to reach out to world leaders and expose Pakistan's evil machinations

 Nobody was ready to accept Pakistan's "non-official actors" excuse
 maine bas ek israel se samarthan nahin maanga kyonki isamen hindustan kaa samarthan kar rahe 54 islamic deshon ko alag-thalag karne kaa jokhim nihit tha
 China's response was predictable
 haalanki vahaan ke netritv ne bharat ke prati apni samvednaa jaahir karne main khaasi furti barti, par unhone yah hakeekat sweekaar nahin kii ki ye hamale pakistan kii dharti se sanchalit tatwon ne kiye the
 Pakistan's own watchful approach was arranged by Pakistan itself
 magar vahaan ke netritv ne hamalon par pesh meri report ko jarur sweekaar kiya
 a fun interlude of the Mumbai attacks came around this time when a special incident occurred which resulted in the Pakistan Air Force being put on alert and the armed forces issued an order to deal with any situation
 kathith taur par mere daftar se raashtrapati (asif ali) jaradaari ko ek phone kol kiya gaya or unhen khaufnak nattejey bhugatne kii dhamkee di gai
 As soon as i landed in Kolkata, i heard about it from my office
 jab main damdam hawaii adde se apane ghar kii taraf ja rahaa tha, mujhe bataaya gaya ki america videsh mantri badi betaabi se mujhase sampark karne kii koshish kar rahi hai
 i called him as soon as i got home
 unhone taaja haalat ke bare main jaananaa chaha or is ittila kii sachaai janani chaahi ki maine pakistan ko khaufnak nattejey bhugatne kii dhamkee di thi
 Although he did not tell me that he was informed by the Pakistani authorities, other sources told me that this information was actually given to him by the Pakistani leadership, which seemed to be really frightening
 maine america videsh mantri se kaha, ''agar aisi koi sambhaavna hoti, to kya aap maanati hai ki desh kaa videsh mantri rajdhani se 1,200 kimi dur hota? main kolkata main hum or kal rajya kii rajdhani se or 250 kimi dur apane nirvachan kshetra main jane kaa mansuba bana rahaa hum
 What you heard is nothing but rumors
 "baad main pakistani akhbaar don ne report chhaapi ki raashtrapati jaradaari ko ek shaks ne farji phone kol kiya tha or yah shaks pakistan kii ek jail main band tha
 He called the President's office and lied that he was speaking from Pranab Mukherjee's office
 lekin hairaani yah thi ki uski asaliyat jaanane kii koshish nahin kii gai
 In fact, this entire episode provided some fun relief in that state of tension
 shivaraj patil kii barkhaastagiyah vahi vakt tha jab kai log tikhi aalochana kii jad main aae
 One of them was also Shivraj Patil
 hamalon ke baad ke falak par charchaa ke liye 29 november ko congress kaaryakarini kii baithak bulaai gai thi
 P
 During this meeting
 chidambaram bahut ruukhe dhang se shivaraj patil ke khilaaf mukhar the or unhone grih mantri ko badalane kii salaah di
 i tried to calm the emotion a little, saying that we should not blame a person; We all have our weaknesses
 is puri charchaa ke dauraan shivaraj patil ne nirlypt bhav se chuppi odhe rakhi
 On the morning of 1 December i had Dr
 singh kaa phone aayaa or unhone suzav diya ki main jitna jaldi-se-jaldi ho sake, unase miluun
 i immediately left for Race Course Road
 meri car jab bheetar daakhil ho rahi thi, maine dekha ki shivaraj patil kii car baahar nikal rahi thi, par us vakt mujhe koi aahat nahin thi ki kya hone vaala he
 As soon as i singh ke dakratar main daakhil hua, unhone mujhe bataaya ki shivaraj patil ne istipha de diya he or sonia gandhi ne suzav diya tha ki main bataur grih mantri kaam sambhaal luun
 He further said that he advised Sonia Gandhi against this because I, as the Minister of External Affairs, was handling the situation like a war and the Ministry cannot afford to change this at this time
 isliye yah tay kiya gaya tha ki pi
 Chidambaram will replace Shivraj Patil
 lagbhag isi vakt pi
 Chidambaram also joined the meeting and we talked about the change
 (kuch hi vakt baad mukherjee ne vitt mantri ke taur par pi
 Succeeded Chidambaram
 )chidambaram ke saath matbhedchidambaram ne ek nayaa rujhaan kaayam kiya tha or karadhaan kii daron main behad oonche str se samuchit nichle staron tak jabardast kami karke bhartiya karadhaan pranali ko nai disha di thi
 His analysis of the economic condition within and outside India was practical, professional and a guide to future policy-makers
 chidambaram ne purv pradhanmantri morarji desai ke 10 bajet pesh karne ke record ke baad desh main duusare sabase zyada bajet pesh kiye hai
 He is intellectually sharp and quite knowledgeable, although he appears occasionally to be crooked due to his very strong beliefs and style of presenting them
 chidambaram or mere bich matbhedon ko lekar khaasi charchaaen hui hai
 i would say that even if there were any differences, they were due to our different views on the economy
 jahaan main anudaar tha or sudhaaron ko lagaataar chalane vaali prakriya maanata tha or arthvyavastha ke samaveshi or dhime silsilewar kayapalat—niyantrit vyavastha—ke haq main tha
 He is a liberal and pro-market economist
 pichhali taarikh vaale kar kaa koi afsos nahimera vah faisla kaaphi bahes-mubahise kaa vishay rahaa tha or aaj din tak he, jo mere is gahare vishwaas se upja tha ki hindustan kii pratyaksh kar niti ko gharelu or videshi sansthaaon ke bich koi bhedbhaav nahin karnaa chahie
 The controversy began when i announced in my budget speech for 2012-13 that i would propose an amendment to the Income Tax Act 1961 to be applied with previous effect to neutralize the Supreme Court's decision in the Vodafone tax case
 manmohan singh kii pannki raay thi ki ity act main prastaavit sanshodhan se desh main epadi ke aane par asar padegaa
 i told them that India is not a "no-tax" (no tax) or "low-tax" (low tax) country
 yahaan sabhi karadaataaon ke saath, chaahe ve yahaan ke bascindia hon yaa gaiyr-bascindia, barabari kaa bartaav kiya jaataa he
 i emphasized that according to the tax laws of our country, if you pay tax in one country, then you do not need to pay tax in the other country where you operate your business and the double tax avoidance agreement (DTAA) fall under
 lekin aisa nahin ho saktaa ki aap katai koi kar hi adaa na karen
 i have given that some institutions have made their tax plan in such a way that they do not have to pay any tax at all
 meri manshaa saaf thiah jahaan ek desh main parisampattiyon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya he, vahaan us desh main us par kar vasula jayega jab tak ki vah ditiee ke daayre main na aata ho
 Later Sonia Gandhi, Kapil Sibal and P
 chidambaram ne bhi yah ashanka jaahir kii ki pichhali taarikh se lagu hone ke sanshodhan se epadi ke liye nakaaratmak maahaul banegaa
 i explained to him that FDI comes when there is profit and it does not come due to zero tax
 kanoon kii manshaa ko saaf karne ke liye spashtikaran dene vaale sanshodhan pesh kiye gaye
 This will bring certainty in the tax case and it will be clear that India has the right to collect tax in similar cases
 mantrimandal ke do or saathiyon ne bhi alag-alag mujhe bich kaa rasta apnaane or is faisle par dobaaraa vichaar karne kii salaah di
 But i stood firm mere prastaav ne meri party ke bheetar or baahar us vakt, or yahaan tak ki ab bhi, jaisi chintaa or vyagrata paidaa kii, uske baavjood mujhe yah dekhakar hairaani hoti he ki pichley paanch saal main mere baad aane vaale harek vitt mantri ne vahi rukh kaayam rakhaa he
 Finally, the President met Sonia Gandhi on the evening of June 2, 2012
 hamane raashtrapati chunaav ko lekar party ke rukh kii samiksha kii or sambhavit ummidavaaron tathaa un ummidavaaron ke liye jaruri samarthan jutaney kii sambhaavna ke bare main baatcheet kii
 During the discussion, he told me clearly, "pranabji, you are the best fit for this post, but you should not forget the very important role you are playing in the functioning of the government
" kya aap koi or naam suza sakate hai?" maine kaha, ''madam, main party kaa aadmi hum
 i have acted according to the advice of the leadership
 isliye mujhe jo bhi jimmedaari di jaati he, main apni puri eemaandaaree se use puraa karuunga
 "he praised my stand
 baithak khatm ho gai or main ek dhundhlee-si chhap lekar lautaa ki ve upie ke raashtrapati pad ke ummidavaar ke taur par manmohan singh par vichaar karne kii icchhuk ho sakati hai
 i thought that if he did the President's position for Dr
 singh kaa chayan kiya to ve mujhe bataur pradhanmantri chun sakati hai
 On June 13, Mamata Banerjee met Sonia Gandhi
 baad main sonia gandhi ne mujhase kaha ki mamata banerjee ne unke samaksh raashtrapati chunaav ke liye upie ke do ummidavaaron ke naamon ko hari jhandi di haih hamid ansaari or main
 Mamta said that she was in talks with Mulayam Singh Yadav on this issue and she will talk to him and tell him again
 haalanki unhone apane faisle ke bare main sonia gandhi ko koi ittila nahin di
 What conversation happened at Mulayam Singh Yadav's house, i do not know
 lekin usee shaam unhone ek sanyukt press conference kii or usamen elaan kiya ki raashtrapati pad ke unke ummidavaar e
 P
 je
 Abdul Kalam, Manmohan Singh and Somnath Chatterjee were, by that order

 On 14 June at 11 pm i went to meet Sonia Gandhi and had a long talk with her
 maine paaya ki ve nirnaayak manodasha main thim
 He told me about his meeting with Mamta Banerjee
 ve is baat se thodi maayoos thim ki mamata ne mulaayam singh yadav ke saath baithak ke baad apane faisle ke bare main hamen nahin bataaya or iske bajaae sidhe media ko jaankaree de di
 He suggested that this issue be discussed further in the core group meeting, which was already scheduled to take place at 7 Race Course Road and in which he, along with the Prime Minister, A
 ke
 Antony, p
 chidambaram, ahamed patel or maine hissaa liya
 i recommended to Sonia Gandhi that they discuss the consequences of my nomination both within the party and the government
 us shaam cabinet or kuch cabinet samitiyon kii ek ke baad ek baithken nirdhaarit thim
 After these meetings Dr
 singh ne mujhe sonia gandhi ke saath hui apni charchaa or mujhe manonith karne ke sanyukt faisle kii ittila di

 The showy symbols of eating and bathing with Dalits will do nothing

 Now we have to talk to the new generation of Dalit youth
 " ve yah bhi kehete hai, ''congress, communist or socialist puure chetan man ke saath jati kii baat karte hai, jabaki bijepi hameshaa avchetan man se karti he
 Therefore, we have made mistakes in understanding the recent events and assessing the circumstances

 What is bjp's biggest challenge for the BJP is to retain the 24 per cent Dalit vote in the Lok Sabha 2014 elections in the Modi wave
 isamen usne uttar pradesh main anusuchit jati kii sabhi 17 surakshit siton par kabja jamaate hue loksabhaa kii kul 84 main se 39 surakshit siton par jabardast jeet darj kii thi
 In the Hindi belt, BJP got 34 percent Dalit votes
 lekin haal kii ghatnaon ne jis tarah party kii chhavi dalit virdohi banaai he, usase ubarne ko lekar asamanjas he kyonki agle saal upi main vidhansabha ke chunaav hone hai
 The election of UP is a litmus test for the Narendra modi-amit Shah duo of BJP as it had a decisive role in their uplift at the national level

 The time to come is only for the Dalits and Backwards
 "modi ke in bayanon ke peeche mukammal aadhaar bhi tha
 At the time of the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP had decorated all the major Dalit faces in its bouquet of social equations, except Mayawati
 dilli main udit raaj jo khulkar mahisasur samaaroh main jate the or hindu dharm ke khilaaf buddha dharm apanaaya tha, unhen saath joda, to bihar main paswan ko saath liya, jinhone modi ke mukhyamantri rahete gujarat main hue dange kii vajah se hi atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv vaali endie sarkaar se istipha de diya tha
 Similarly, Ramdas Athawale's party RPI in Maharashtra and Vijayakanth's party in Tamil Nadu were added
 lekin satta main aane ke baad jis tarah party ko dalit mudde par vipareet paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he, usne bijepi kii peshaani par bal laa diya he
 "in the last 20-25 years, Dalit politics has become so sharp and reactionary that it is unable to match the bjp's social base," says a senior BJP leader
 isliye ranneetik taur par kai baar virodhabhas dikhne lagata he
 "the Dalit politics of federally nurtured symbols will have to look at history to understand the Dalit dilemma of the BJP
 bijepi kaa saamaajik aadhaar aam taur par madhya or savarna varg tak tha
 The upper castes have always dominated the front line of the organizational structure of the sangh-bjp
 isliye sangh bhi is chhavi ko badalane kii ranneeti par kaam kar rahaa tha
 "in 1967, Dalit organizations DS-4 and later BSP chanted and openly opposed many slogans like tilak-scales and talwar against the Brahmins," says a Sangh official
 lekin daliton main sandesh dene ke liye sangh ne hi teen baar bijepi ko mayawati se gathjod karne kii salaah di thi
 "first of all, when the BJP could not form the government in UP in 1993 elections despite the boom of Ram temple movement, in 1995, it decided to support Mayawati
 tab kalyaan singh puri tarah se khilaaf the, lekin sangh ne daliton main sandesh dene ke liye samarthan kaa faisla kiya
 This was also repeated in 1997
 isi tarah 2002 main rajnath singh kii anichhaa ke baavjood bijepi ne phir mayawati ko samarthan diya
 But with such symbols, the sangh-bjp's attempt to make inroads in Dalits did not materialize
 sangh ne pratikon kii raajnneeti karte hue ram mandir ke shilanyas main bhi pehali eent dalit netaa kameshwar paswan se rakhwai thi
 The bjp's Madhya Pradesh government's efforts to see the support of Dalits through symbols ambedkar kii janmasthali mau main smarak banaakar kii to centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi sarkaar ke samay dilli ke alipur road sthiti ambedkar nivas ko ambedkar neshnal memorial ke taur par banaaya

 lekin in kaamon ke jariye sangh jo aadhaar taiyaar karata he, us par bijepi netaaon kii bayaanbaji pani pher detii he
 However, Dayashankar, who made abusive remarks against Mayawati, was shown a way out of the party in a few hours by the BJP
 una kii ghatana ne bhi sansad main party ko bachaav kii mudra main laa khadaa kiya
 Soon after the Damashankar episode of Damage Control, the saffron co-government Krishna Gopal held a two-round consultation with BJP President Amit Shah and other senior leaders at Rajnath Singh's residence
 isamen aage kii ranneeti par vichaar kiya gaya
 a BJP leader argues, "whether it is the Rohit Vemula episode or the Una incident, the secular brigade is dragging the BJP under the conspiracy because the secular camp has realized that raising the BJP to the dock on communal issues It gives a political advantage
 isliye ab saamaajik agenda par bijepi ko badnaam karne kii koshish ho rahi he
 "however they maintain that the party is on the backfoot in the battle of social perceptions
 sangh is masale par philhal chup he kyonki nagpur kii pratinidhi sabha kii baithak ke baad shuru saamaajik samarasata abhiyaan ko dhakka laga he
 The Sangh started the campaign with the slogan of a temple, a well, a crematorium, which took the initiative to increase the social base
 lekin haal kii ghatnaon ne sangh ke agenda par pani pher diya
 Now the Sangh has made special preparations for the Raksha Bandhan celebrated on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan on 18 August
 swayamsevakon ko dalit bahanon se raakhi bandhavane or unke gharon main jaakar baatcheet karne kaa nirdesh diya gaya he, taaki saamaajik sadbhaavna kaa maahaul phir se banaaya ja sake
 The Sangh is now strategizing to monitor organizations of its contacts such as the Gorkshak Dal

 a BJP leader says that if he were to be of age, he would not have been made the chief minister in May 2014
 bijepi adhyaksh shah ne bhi upi kii team ko chetavanee di he ki chunavi rau main bayaanbaji par niyantran rakhen
 After this, UP BJP President Keshav Prasad Maurya repeated this warning in the meeting of officials
 upi main bijepi ne apane sabhi 17 dalit saansadon ko sadbhaavna samaaroh karne or dalit kshetron main pravaas badhaane kaa nirdesh diya he, jabaki anya rajyon main dalit netaaon ko apane str se nav saamaajik manch banaakar daliton kaa bharosa kaayam rakhane vaale abhiyaan chalaane ko kaha he
 In Bihar, Sanjay Paswan has organized National Social Summit on 21 (jayanti of former Bihar CM Bhola Paswan), 23 (dinkar Jayanti), 25 September (deendayal Upadhyay Jayanti)
 rashtriya str par dharna kii ladaai ke liye party ne chaar stareey ranneeti banaai he
 Responding first, in a planned manner, in which the figures of Dalit atrocities are kept comparatively
 duusari—nichle str par daliton se sidhaa sampark sthapit karnaa, khaas taur se gaiyr jatav daliton se
 The party has given a message to non-jatavs by making Krishna Raj of Pasi society a minister from UP
 isamen stand-ap india ke tahat daliton ko milane vaale lone se nae udhyami khadaa hone kii baat or mudra bank yojana ke phaayde ginanaa he
 Third - Image improvement exercise among Dalits using Sangh's network
 iske tahat raksha parv main shaamil hona
 Fourth — an attempt to connect most Dalit leaders with the BJP, so that the message that the party is with the Dalits
 sutron ke mutabik, is ranneeti ke tahat bispi se kaaphi dalit netaaon ko party main laane kii ranneeti ban gai he
 The BJP has agreed that it is not possible for Dalits to break the Jatav vote, so the party is focusing on non-jatav votes
 lekin bijepi ke hi dalit netaa or chintakon kaa maananaa he ki iske liye bhi maanavtaa se badi gaay vaali chhavi use badalani hogi
 At the same time, to win the trust of Dalits, he must first stand up with valiant Dalit leaders, not circumambulation

 With this, he said that the Naxalites should adopt a democratic way to raise their issues

 On July 10, Sushma reiterated the need for Aziz to issue a letter in reference to another case
 unhone apane pakistani samakaksh dwaara shishtachar nahin dikhaane par naaraazgi jataai thi
 Sushma had said that Aziz did not take any cognizance of her personal letter, in which she had appealed for a Pakistani visa for Kulbhushan Jadhav's mother
 haalanki mantri ne ajij ko aashwast kiya tha ki unki sifarish par medical vija maangane vaale pakistani naagarik ko turant bharat aane ke liye vija diya jayega

 On Wednesday, some parties sent by the PDP sent an invitation to form the government, while Governor Satyapal Malik dissolved the state assembly within minutes
 rajyapal ke is faisle kii kai partiyaan aalochana kar rahi hai
 Speaking to Aaj Tak, Governor Satyapalmalik also gave the reasons behind this decision
 unhone kaha ki unhen ashanka thi ki sarkaar banane ke liye kharid-farokht ho sakati he, isliye unhen ye faisla lenaa padaa
 He also said that he did not receive any letter from Mehbooba Muftiya Sajjad Lone

 lekin rajya main modi kii jagah lene ke kareeb ek maah main hi unhone bhadu ko mukhyamantri karyaalay ke sachiv ke taur par niyukt kar diya
 It was not the only incident
 pichley saal aktubar ke aakhir main mukhyamantri ne rajdhani gandhinagar ke do skulon kaa auchak nirikshan kiya or ek skool ke computer lab ko band paaya
 She returned to her office after speaking to school officials and immediately issued a government order regarding the use and maintenance of computer labs in state government schools
 sankshep main kahen to patel ke kaamkaaj kaa tarika apane purvavarti se kaaphi alag he
 As an administrator, Modi relied more on the information received from his trusted officials
 unki chhavi ek sakht netaa kii thi, jisase naukarshah behatar nattejey dene ko lekar behad chintit rahete the
 But Patel, during a surprise visit, takes input from the local people and assesses the administrative functioning himself
 yah behatar prashasan dene ke liye unki micromanagement ranneeti kaa hissaa he
 If Anandiben lacks the charisma and perhaps Modi's vision, then she is removing that deficiency with her hard work
 sabase pehle keshubhai patel or phir modi mantrimandal main mantri ke taur par varshon kaam karte hue unki ranneeti kamyaabi ke saath ubhari he
 And it seems to be doing better in the second year as the Chief Minister of Gujarat
 to aakhir gandhinagar main yah badlaav kis tarah kaa he? rajya kii naukarshahi main kam se kam abhi tak koi shikayati lahaza to nahin hi he
 K
 Anandiben Patel, principal secretary, who worked with Modi
 kailashnath bataate hai ki haalanki donon ke kaam karne kaa tarika alag he lekin donon kaa puraa dhyaan parinaam par hota he
 He says, "both are administrators working 18 hours
 " shahari vikaas sachiv ji
 R
 aloria isse sahmati jataate hai, "faisla lene kii unki kshamta teevr or paardarshee he
 "and it shows that she knows exactly what she needs
 isliye gaanvon kaa daura karte hue ve colector se baat karne se pehle sarpanch or patawaari se baat karti hai, taaki yah jaan saken ki adhikari se kya kahana he
 She also meets with local party workers before meeting with officials of various departments to understand local problems
 mukhyamantri ke jamnagar daure par unke saath yatra karte hue india today ne aisa hi paaya
 His style of working hard and keeping track of the plans has made him a skilled administrator in a one-year tenure, while as the Minister of Revenue and Urban Development he has already been a dedicated administrator
 pichley saal anandiben ko gujarat kii satta saunpte hue modi ne saarvajanik rup se unki saraahna karte hue kaha tha ki unhone rajasav jaise mahatvapurn par dushkar vibhaag ko bhi thik kar diya
 He had revenue department since 2007
 aaj ek saal baad, anandiben modi ke bharose ko or aage badhaati dikhaai padati hai
 But with this bureaucracy, their weaknesses have also been revealed
 unamem se ek yah he ki afasaron main unka utana bhay nahin he jaisaa modi kaa hota tha or prashasan par unki pakad bhi modi ke mukaable kamjor he
 Patel will also have to do a lot of work for the party organization
 modi apni vyaktigat apil, netritv kshamta, kathor mizaaj or bharosemand amit shah kii badaulat party main sabase nichle str se upar tak gahari antardrushti rakhte the
 Patel's understanding of the first year in this case seems weak
 haal ke dinon main pradesh bijepi sanghathan main unke hisaab se jo badlaav kiya gaya he, usamen dekha gaya he ki kharaab pradarshan karne waalon ko behatar kaam karne waalon kii tulana main zyada ahmiyat mili he
 Bharat Pandya has been removed from the post of state general secretary of the party, while introducing a better organizer, he did an excellent job of spreading Anandiben Patel's work among party officials and the common people
 yah rahasy hi bana hua he ki unhen kyon hataaya gaya
 This change has come at the time in the state BJP, which is under question, when the elections of panchayats and corporations are to be held in the state in October this year
 patel ke saamne ek or chunauti he
 He will also have to face the issue of caste with full force, which Modi did not face
 modi obisi samudaay se taalluk rakhte the
 But he is from the dominant Patel community
 pradesh congress adhyaksh bharat singh solanki pichhadi kshatriya jati se aate hai, jo patelon kii paaramparik pratidwandvi he or sankhya main bhi zyada he
 State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi says, "the comment on Anandiben's one-year tenure is that she has been a complete failure in police and law and order
 " jaisaa ki unka daawa he, modi ke kaarykaal ke vipareet congress abhi majboot sthiti main he
 But party leaders and activists claim that the expansion from Modi's "vibrant Gujarat" to Patel's "dynamic Gujarat" is on the road to success

 Even according to data from the Union Urban Development Ministry, Gujarat is at the forefront of states that install drainage systems in small towns in the country

 unki duusari sabase badi or ahm uplabdhi maatr 18 maheenon main 34 shahari vikaas master plan or 185 nagar yojana yojanaon ko antim rup dena he
 Local BJP leaders feel that although Patel's rule will keep them in good standing, their immature political decisions will affect their efficient administrative functions
 vaise anandiben ko yakeen he ki apane behatar kaaryon or nikaay chunaavon main mahilaon ko 50 fisadi aarakshan ke unke aitihaasik faisle se unki party ko jeet milegi
 Anandiben is an average speaker but during her speeches she tries to convince people how they can take advantage of a lot of government schemes
 modi kii tulana main bhale hi unka bhaashan karishmai nahin ho par uskaa vishay acha hota he
 She says, "I believe in working seriously and giving my 100% towards work
 agar aap achche se kaam karte hai to nishchit rup se nattejey behatar honge
 "his first real test is the body elections, which are to be held later this year
 unka parinaam hi anandiben ke aakhri do varshon kaa lahaza tay karegaa

 Pained to know that u don't hv time to be with the winners & not presenting all the awardsi think it is happening for the first time in 65 years that awardees of # nationalfilmawards wont be felicitated by @rashtrapatibhvn
 Only 11 out of 141 will get awards from the President
 This is how the best of Indian Cinema is being treated
 # sadit is unfortunate Hon’ble President of India has not been able to find time to present ALL National Film Awards that show Case India’s creativity,performing Arts& Soft Power
 President should reconsider as awards presented by the office he represents different gravitassadly, even the President doesn't care for the # nationalfilmawards
 He's allocated just one hour from his 'busy' schedule, to distribute trophies
 The idea of state honoring artists anyway is distasteful
 And then to pick & choose a select few for the award ceremony is humiliating them further, and doing disservice to, almost mocking, their talents
 # nationalfilmawardshttps: / / t
 co / 36ejn8ld7kone of the reason the National Film Awards are prestigious is because they are handed by the @rashtrapatibhvn -not a minister
 This is a moment of a lifetime for film makers; please don't deprive them of their merit / glory # nationalfilmawards @ smritiirani @ ra_thore (input bhashaa se bhi) The Ministry of Skill Development of the Government of India is going to start a Pathological Services Center in every village in Bihar

 charchit aarushi-hemraj hatyakand main elahabaad hoicourt ne dow
 Rajesh and Nupur Talwar are acquitted
 hoicourt ne faisla sunaate hue kaha ki talwaar danpati ne aarushi ko nahin maaraa
 The court's decision gave relief to the Talwar couple
 lekin phir se sawaal uth rahaa he ki aakhir aarushi or hemraj kaa katl kisne kiya?gajiabad kii sibiai court ne is maamle par lambii sunwaayee karne baad 26 november, 2013 ke din talwaar danpati ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 After which he appealed in the Allahabad High Court against the decision of the CBI court
 talwaar dampatiis samay gajiabad kii dasna jail main band hai
 The High Court verdict has raised questions over the cbi's investigation
 yahaan tak ki jaj ne faisla sunaane se pehle jaanch kii khaamiyon kaa zikr bhi kiya
 From the court's perspective, the CBI failed in its investigation
 na to sibiai ke paas vyapaak str par saboot the or na hi gavaah
 In such a case, the court acquitted the Talwar couple by acquitting the charge
 haalanki sibiai ne court main is hatyakand kii daleel dete hue kaha tha ki talwaar danpati ne aarushi ko naukar ke saath aapattijanak sthiti main dekh liya tha or usee ke baad yah khaufnak kadam uthaaya tha
 The CBI court accepted the arguments of the investigating team
 usee ke baad da
 Rajesh and Nupur Talwar were convicted of murder
 baad main faisla sunaate hue sibiai court ne donon ko umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 It seemed then that the matter is now clear
 lekin jaanch main kuch sawaalon ke jawaab milanaa baaki tha
 These were the same questions which now proved to be the Brahmastra for the Talwar couple in the High Court
 sabooton kii kami or gavaahon kii kamajori ne hoicourt ke saamne sibiai kii sari daleelein naakaam kar deen
 On the intervening night of May 15-16, 2008, Aarushi's body was found on her bed
 iske baad ek-ek kar itani naatakeey ghatnaayen saamne ain ki puraa maamla krisi krime thriller film main tabdeel ho gaya
 No one knew what would happen in the next moment
 upi police maamle kii jaanch karti rahi lekin koi nateeja nahin niklaa
 The investigation was later handed over to the CBI
 logon ko ummid thi ki aarushi kii hatya kaa raaj sibiai zarur benakaab kar degi
 But this could not happen
 yah murder itane shaatir tareeke se anjaam diya gaya ki sochna bhi mushkil tha ki aakhir kaatil koun he
 However, when the murder took place, the suspicion was made on the house servant Hemraj
 lekin agle din jab hemraj kii laash ghar kii chat par mili to ye puraa maamla or jyaga ulajh gaya
 45-year-old Yama Prasad Banjade alias Hemraj Talwar was a loyal domestic servant of the couple
 unheen ke saath rahata tha
 The keys to the house were held by him only
 vah sharaab nahin peetaa tha
 His family lived in Nepal
 police hameshaa kii tarah bade-bade daawey karti rahi ki lekin hasil kuch nahin kar saki
 Even before the CBI investigation, the UP police had described the case as honor killing
 us vakt sansanikhej tareeke se noida police ne daawa kiya tha ki aarushi-hemraj kaa kaatil koi or nahin balki uske pita doctor rajesh talwaar hai
 The police argued for the honor behind this theory
 23 may, 2008 ko police ne beti kii hatya ke aarope main rajesh talwaar ko giraftaar kar liya tha
 But by then, there had been so many changes in the case that this case of murder had become a blind case
 maamla surkhiyon main tha, lihaaja upi sarkaar ne 31 may, 2008 ko aarushi-hemraj murder cese kii jaanch sibiai ke hawaale kar di thi
 Doctor Rajesh Talwar was behind bars on charges of murder
 aarushi murder kesadesh bhar main charchaa kaa vishay bana hua tha
 During this, Talwar's narco test took place
 shaq kii sui tab tak talwaar se hatakar unke naukaron or compounder tak pahunch gai thi
 Rajkumar, a servant of the Durrani family close to the Talwar family, was also arrested
 varsh 2010 main do saal baad sibiai ne closer report daakhil kii thi
 The trial went on and then the needle of suspicion was once again stuck on the Talwar couple in the face of allegations
 gajiabad court ne talwaar dampatti ko saboot mitaane kaa doshi paaya tha
 Charges of involvement in the aarushi-hemraj murder case were framed against both
 magar ab hoicourt ne 9 saal baad is dabl murder cese main talwaar danpati bari kar diya
 As a result, after 9 years, the same question has come up again who killed Aarushi and Hemraj
 koun he donon kaa kaatil? is sawaal kaa jawaab abhi milanaa baaki he
 After the coming three years, people in your country will be thicker or leaner, this thing can be ascertained today through the major newspapers of the country

 sankhyikee aankade ekatra karne, sankalit karne or prasaarit karne ke maamle main sankhyikee vyavastha ko swytt or paardarshee hona chahie
 It must be free from political interference
 bharat kii sankhyikee vyavastha tab se andeh ke ghere main he, jab 2015 main kendriya sankhyikee karyaalay (CSO) ne nai jidipi siries jari kii thi
 These figures were released on the basis of 2011-12, changing the base year and showing faster pace of growth as compared to previous years
 tabase kai aise maukey aae hai jab aadhikarik aankadon kii vishwasaneeyata par sawaal uthe hai
 To change with the upa's tenure figures, to increase the data for the year of demonetisation, to prevent the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) employment data from being transmitted, as opposed to the National Statistical Commission (NSC) Whether the resignation of Chairman PC Mohanan and its member JV Meenakshi or bypassing the National Statistical Commission
 in sabamein niti ayog ne badi bhoomika nibhaai, haalanki, use iskaa adhikaar nahin tha
 But the figures causing inconvenience to the government were sidelined
 in ghatnaon kii vahaj se 108 arthshaastriyon or samajashastriyon ne virodh karte hue chintaa jaahir kii ki sarkaar sankhyikeey aankadon ke maamle main raajnneetik hastkshep kar rahi he
 These people campaigned to restore the 'institutional autonomy' and 'integrity' of the statistical organizations
 sankhyikeey vyavastha kii swaittatabharat ke sankhyikee vibhaag main kai baaten aisi hui hai jo isaki vishwasaneeyata ke liye gambhir maamla he
 Such as appointments to the post of Chief Statistician (CSI) and to the National Statistical Commission (NSC)
 sarkaar ne padon kii niyuktiyon main badlaav kiya, aankadon kii gunvattta, swaittata, data collection or unhen prasaarit karne ke maamalon main hastkshep kiya
 Both the Chief Statistician and the National Statistical Commission are independent in their methodology
 ve sarkaar kii saamaanya naukarshahi kaa hissaa nahin hai, 2001 main rangarajan kamishan kii report main kii gai siforeeshon ke aadhaar par 2006 main inaki swaittata or paar darshita ko sunishchit kiya gaya tha, lekin ab inhen kendriya sankhyikee or kaarykram karyanvayan mantralay (emoespiai) ke antargat le aayaa gaya he
 The uncertainty of uncertainty at present is because on May 23, when the entire country was eyeing the election results, the NDA government passed an order for the restructuring of the statistics department
 is aadesh ke mutabik, rashtriya sankhyikee karyaalay (NSO) or isse jude vibhaag jaise eneseso, siesao aadi kendriya sankhyikee or kaarykram karyanvayan mantralay (emoespiai) kaa ang honge
 NSSO and CSO were merged with NSO and Secretary level officer was made the head of NSO under the Union Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI)
 yah punargathan kii prakriya siesai or enessi donon ko lekar maun he
 Pranab Sen, who was the first CSI between 2007-10, says this government order has raised some apprehensions
 pehla, eneseso jo rashtriya str par vibhinn saamaajik-aarthik aankade ekatra karata he, iskaa vajood samaapt kar diya gaya or ise saamaanya naukarshahi kaa hissaa bana diya gaya
 Secondly, there is no mention of CSI and NSC in this order, what will be their work? Mohanan's apprehension is that when CSI and NSC are not autonomous institutions, there will be complete political interference in the statistical system, such as other government Happens in departments
 sarkaar ke aadesh se aisa lag rahaa he ki kendriya sankhyikee or kaarykram karyanvayan mantralay (emoespiai) kaa sachiv hi siesai kii jagah legaa
 There are reports that the government is going to give it constitutional status
 agar aisa hota he to yah sahi disha main hoga lekin saath main yah bhi sunishchit karnaa hoga ki yah vibhaag raajnneetik hastkshep se mukt rah sake
 The NSC has not had any chairman or independent member since January
 aankadon kii gunvatttalambe samay se aankadon kii gunvattta kaa sawaal bana hua he
 Recently, such figures were released from the NSSO which have been disputed
 aise main yah khyaal rakhana jaruri he ki aankadon kii gunvattta ko behatar banaaya jaae
 NSC is seeking more resources to enhance its quality
 lekin sarkaar ne is maang par dhyaan nahin diya he
 Mohanan raised such problems while resigning in January this year
 is gambhir sthiti ko ulatney or sankhyikee vibhaag kii vishwasaneeyata ko behaal karne ke liye kya kiya janaa chahie? iske liye pranab sen do suzav dete hai
 First, csi's autonomy should be restored and an executive head appointed
 doosraa, enessi ko majboot kiya jaae jo ki ek part time chairman ke saath ek part time vibhaag he
 At least its chairman and two members should be made full-time employees by giving constitutional status
 mohanan kaa kahana he ki eneseso or siesao ko lekar enessi kii jimmedaariyon ko badhanaa chahie
 It should provide experts to cover GDP, social sector data and sample survey
 sabhi aankade sambandhi gatividhiyon ko taarkik bananaa chahie, taaki siesai sirf sankhyikee par gaur kar sake
 Overall, more surveys, and more studies are needed on the economy for better policies and better social development

 However, the final decision on RLD and SP-BSP alliance is to be made today
 RLD upaadhyaksh jayant choudhary or sapa pramukh akhilesh yadav kii lakhanu main mulaakaat karne vaale hai, jahaan areldi ko milane vaali siton par se suspence khatm ho jayega
 It is being told that after the meeting, Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary will also go to meet Mayawati
 bataa den ki sapa-basapa gathbandhan main do siten RLD ke liye rakhi gai thim
 Two seats have been held for Ajit Singh from Muzaffarnagar and Jayant Chaudhary from Baghpat
 haalanki, sutron kii maane to areldi jahaan gathbandhan main paanch siton kii maang kar rahi he, vahiin sapa-basapa gathbandhan se 2 siten milane kaa anumaan he
 The RLD has also sought seats for Kairana, Mathura and Hathras
 magar hathras kii seat basapa ke cote main ja chuki haior mayawati apane cote se RLD ko koi seat dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 In such a situation, Akhilesh has agreed to give Mathura seat to RLD from SP quota
 kairana kii seat ko lekar pench fnsaa he
 Theoretically prepared for an alliance with the RLD and the SP-BSP
 is par gathbandhan kaa aupchaarik elaan guuruuvaar ko elaan ho saktaa he
 Let us know that by holding a joint press conference in UP capital Lucknow, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati ended the suspension on seat sharing and kept 38-38 seats

 But on Wednesday, Jayant Chaudhary met Akhilesh Yadav and asked for seats in Kairana, Mathura and Hathras
 kairana seat par sapa ke samarthan se RLD kii ummidavaar tabbasum hasan upachunaav jiti thim
 Akhilesh had assured the RLD to give two more seats to the SP quota, but Hathras seat has already gone to the BSP quota
 haalanki, kairana or mathura seat par areldi ke daravaaje abhi band nahin hue hai
 RLD can still be discussed in two seats
 sutron kii maane to akhilesh yadav jahaan areldi ko apane cote se seat dene ko taiyaar hai, vahiin mayawati apane cote se RLD ko ek bhi seat dene ko taiyaar nahin hai
 However, after the 15th of this month, Akhilesh and Jayant Chaudhary will meet again in which there will be discussion on sitting at the table and coordinating with the RLD in western Uttar Pradesh
 vahiin sapa apane cote se ek seat nishad party or ek seat opi rajbhar ko bhi de sakati he
 SP Nishad will contest the party's Sanjay Nishad on the symbol of SP
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki sapa opi rajbhar ko saath laane kii koshish bade faayde ke liye kar rahi he
 It is believed that if OP Rajbhar comes into the grand alliance, he will bring four mlas with him
 aise main chaar vidhayakon ke aane se ek rajyasabha seat par bhi daavedaari hogi
 In such a situation, giving seat to Rajbhar is a profitable deal for SP
 filhal opi rajbhar bijepi ke saath gathbandhan main hai or loksabhaa chunaav main apane liye do se zyaada siten maang kar bijepi par dabaav banane kii koshish kar rahe hai
