 The US military has currently allowed a Sikh military captain posted on the battle front to shave and wear a turban in a unique case of religious harmony
 kaha ja rahaa he ki yah maamla un sainikon ke maamle main kaaphi mahatv rakh saktaa he, jo apni dharmik pahchaan ke saath sena kii seva karnaa chaahate hai
 According to a New York Times report, Captain Simrat Pal Singh had to get his hairstyle and beard haircut on the first day at the US Military Academy 10 years ago
 vajah yah thi ki america sena main kisi bhi sainik ko lambey bal or dadhi rakhane kii ijaajat nahin he
 However, the picture changed for Captain Singh last week
 sena ne unhen dadhi badhaane or kesh ko pagadi main baandhne kii ijaajat de di
 According to the New York Times, Captain Singh, who has been awarded the Bronze Star Award, said, "it's amazing
 main dohari jindagi ji rahaa tha
 Used to wear a turban at home
 ' singh ne kaha, 'meri do duniya aakhirkaar ek saath aa gai
 ' akhbaar ne bataaya he ki dharmik aasthaa ko manyata dene kaa yah dashakon main pehla maamla he, jab jang ke morche par tainaat sainik ko dadhi rakhane kii chhot di gai he
 With this, Muslims and other communities are expected to get an exemption according to their religious faith
 lekin, yah chhot abhi sirf ek maheene ke liye di gai he
 After this, the army will decide whether the temporary exemption given to Singh should be made permanent

 Prior to Captain Singh, the three Sikhs have been allowed to shave in the army, but not all of them were members of the militants actively fighting on the front
 neuyark times kii report ke mutabik, captain simrat paal singh ko 10 saal pehle america sainya academy main pehle din apane kesh or dadhi ke bal katwane pade the
 The reason was that no soldier is allowed to have long hair and beard in the US Army
 lekin, beete hafte captain singh ke liye tasviir badal gai
 The army allowed him to grow a beard and tie his hair in a turban
 neuyark times ke mutabik, branj star award se sammanit kiye ja chuke captain singh ne kaha, 'yah adbhut he
 i was living a double life
 ghar par hi pagadi pahentaa tha
 Singh said, 'my two worlds have finally come together
 ' The newspaper has reported that this is the first case in decades of recognizing religious faith, when a soldier posted on the war front is allowed to shave
 isse musalamaanon or anya samudaayon ko apni dharmik aasthaa ke hisaab se chhot milane kii ummid jaagi he
 However, this rebate has been given for just one month
 iske baad sena tay karegi ki kya singh ko di gai asthai chhot ko sthai bana diya jaae
 Singh, however, told the New York Times that if this facility is not fixed, he is ready to sue

 We stayed together for some time

 But after this role of mine, he had to stop working
 wo kahin bhi audishan ke liye jaataa to use kehete ki is kirdaar or is tarah ke accent ke saath to navazuddin pehle hi ek kirdaar kar chuke hai
 He used to say that we are like this in the original, he had copied me

 is par unhone kaha, vah to 'hit of da moment' (taatkaalik swaabhaavik ubaal) tha
 i know you are talking about that Mahendra Singh Dhoni video
 yah video us vakt or mashhoor ho gaya, jab dhoni us mukaam par pahunch gaye, jahaan vah aaj hai
 'actually, this incident is of those days when Mahendra Singh Dhoni was not the captain of Indian cricket team
 2005 main pakistan kii team bharat main 6 vanade maichon kii siries khel rahi thi
 The fourth ODI of that series was played on 12 April in Ahmedabad
 us match main ashish nehra ne dhoni ko gaali di thi
 But, Dhoni was silent even after hearing the abuse
 is promo main nehra ne or kya-kya kaha-- meraa safar bahut shandaar rahaa he, choton or mere sharir ke kaaran maine bahut utaar-chadhaav dekhe hai
 i have learned a lot during this time
 - jis tarah kaa cricket aaj khelaa ja rahaa he, aise main bataur tej gendbaaj 38 saal kii umr main khelnaa aasaan nahin he
 There was a time when i did not play for 2 years

 But on the last ball of the fourth over of the innings, Dhoni dropped Afridi's catch
 vah gend nehra kii thi
 At that time Pakistan's score was 22 / 0, Afridi was on 10 runs
 kaich chhootane par nehra ko kaaphi gussa aayaa or unhone dhoni ko gaali dekar kaich chhodane ke liye kosa
 However, then Nehra would not have expected that the one he was abusing would be the next 'captain Cool' of the Indian team
 yakeen maniye dhoni tab bhi kool rahe
 He thought it better to remain silent by not giving any answer to Nehra
 tab unki kool chhavi vaali behtareen jhalak dekhne ko mili
 But that 'raudra roop' video of Nehra was captured, which is still viral on social media
 afridi ne us mukaable main 23 gedon main tabadatod 40 ran bana daale the
 Eventually Laxmipathy Balaji managed to catch him at the hands of Sachin
 jabaki nehra ko us match main ek bhi safalataa nahin mili
 He conceded 75 runs in 9 overs
 bharat ne vah muqabla teen wicket se ganvaa diya

 So, what is the reason that when the big stage comes, other countries take over
 
 
 duniya kii sabase kaamyaab lig indian premier lig (ipel) bharat main hi he
 
 
 Indian stars remain superhit in the Champions League T20 as well, but do not know what happens to these stars in Twenty20 international matches

 Pakistan has the team at number two, with 125 points
 
 
 is list main team india 121 ankon ke saath tisare number par hai
 
 
 Not only that, where Indian batsmen dominate the test and one-day rankings, it is difficult even to find Indian players in T20 rankings

 No Indian is included in the list of T20 bowlers

 So, now all that can be expected is that the Indian players who have played in the IPL and Champions League, play in international matches as well, and give the fans a chance and reason to be happy by showing awesome

 aaj bhale hi sani deol ne politics main entry maar lee ho magar unke prashansak aaj bhi unhen filmon main ection karte hue hi dekhnaa chaahate hai
 Not just action, Sunny Deol also did a lot of romance in Bollywood
 ye romance sirf silver screen tak hi simit nahin rahaa balki isse nikal kar asal jindagi main bhi aayaa
 Born on October 19, 1956, some special things about Sunny Deol's personal life
 sani deol rigerv actor hai
 He is not interested in attending social life, Bollywoodparties and award ceremonies
 sani deol family person hai
 Sunny Deol married Pooja Deol in the year 1984
 puja ke saath unka rishta kaaphi personal he
 Even the pictures of both of them are rarely seen
 sani deol media main or soshal place par bhi puja ke bare main baat nahin karte
 Only extremely rare photos of the wedding of both have reached the audience
 bataa den ki sani deol ne 1984 main puja ke saath shaadi kii thi
 They have two sons from this marriage
 karan or rajvir deol
 Karan has made his Bollywood debut with the movie "pal Pal Dil Ke Paas"
 iskaa nirdesan khud sani deol ne kiya he
 At the same time, there was a time when the romance of Kisni Deol was discussed with Dimple Kapadia
 sani deol or dimple kapaadiya kii lav story kaaphi puraani he
 It was even said in the reports that Dimple Kapadia had separated from Rajesh Khanna after a few years of marriage
 kaaka se alag hone ke baad unhone ghar chhod diya tha
 During this time he did many films with Sunny Deol
 tabhi donon ke bich pyaar panpa
 The duo also proved to be an onscreen hit
 ek samay aisa tha jab bollywood galiyaaron main sani or dimple ke afaire kii khub charchaa hoti thi
 There were also reports of staying with sunny-dimple
 donon kaa relation 11 saal tak chalaa tha
 Meanwhile, there were reports of their marriage
 kaha jaataa he ki jab sani or dimple date kar rahe the to dimple kii donon betiyaan tvinkal or rinki khanna, sani ko 'chote papa' kahkar bulaane lagi thim
 Some years ago, the video of both of them went viral, and if they do not go back much further, then the close proximity between the two years is confirmed by a video in September 2017
 donon kaa ek video viral hua tha
 In the viral video, Sunny Deol and Dimple Kapadia were seen holding each other's hands in London
 video main dimple ke ek haath main cigarette tha jabaki unka doosraa haath sani deol ne thama tha
 The closeness seen between the two had exposed the truth of their relationship
 abhi bhi donon ke rishte kii gutthi kaaphi uljhi hui he
 And now Sunny Deol has also joined politics
 aise main ye dekhne vaali baat hogi ki bhavishya main is rishte kii or girahen khulengi yaa phir ye rishta itahaas kii kuch yaaden ban kar rah jayega

 tab ye samaj aayaa ki jo log ye kehete hanki tum aurat ho, tumhaare liye aasaani hogi
 
 
 They lie
 court kii har sunwaayee main aapse kuch aise sawaal kiye jate hai jo aapako kured kar rakh dete hai
 3
 talaak ke baad samaj aayaa ki apana ek sarkal bananaa chahie
 In which there are only those people who will be happy to talk and live with
 jinka saath sukh main bhi ho or dukh main bhi
 4
 talaak se pehle har choti-badi baat ke liye wo khud ko hi doshi maanati thi
 She used to think that it is her fault in whatever is happening, but after the divorce, it was understood that the fault cannot be of any one
 5
 After the divorce, it was understood that whoever suffers from the relationship, should erase all the memories associated with it
 is baat ko apanaate hue usne pati se judi har yaad ko jaise shaadi kii photographs, video memory, digital memory sabakuch delit kar diya
 6
 khud ko kosna chhod diya
 It is good to admit your mistake but it is wrong to blame others for ignoring yourself
 7
 There should always be time for yourself
 shaadi ke baad ham ladkiyaan khud ko bilkul hi bhul jate hai
 But this is wrong because it is our only loss
 8
 No matter what happens, we cannot quit being happy and it is our right to be happy
 ye hamase koi nahin chin saktaa
 9
 chizon or paristhitiyon se bhaagna chhod den
 By running away from the circumstances, we do only and only our own loss
 10
 Most importantly, the divorce has happened and it is wrong to associate it with prestige

 bharat jaise bade loktantr main voton kii ginati main gadabadi kii sajeesh sambhav to he, lekin digital india kii ore badhate is desh ko voton ke liye dobaaraa ballat box kii taraf waapas bhejnaa kitna sahi he? export bhi EVM se chhedchhad kii ashanka ko khaarij nahin karte
 Cyber expert Pawan Duggal says, 'these machines used for voting are not connected to the Internet, so no idea of cybercrime will work in it, but the possibility of disturbances in it cannot be ruled out
 suraksha main tainaat logon ke meljol se is mashin main gadabadi kii ja sakati he
 'pawan Duggal explains,' EVM is a computer of its kind and its logarithms or mechanisms can be teased during or before counting
 ' EVM kii suraksha kii baat karen to ye staneylon mashin hai
 Meaning to tamper with it one has to tamper with each machine
 isaki suraksha ke maddenjar ise kisi network se nahi joda gaya he or isiilie har mashin main chhedchhad kii gunjaaish khatm ho jaati hai, lekin phir bhi mashin vishesh kii suraksha main send lagaaya ja saktaa he
 He said, "so far this successful running machine in India is safe, but still there is nothing wrong in reconsidering its security layers in view of the cyber security policy
" ' unhone kaha ki agar america jaise advance desh kii voting mashin main chhedchhad kii baat saamne ai he to bharat jaise tezi se badhate loktantr ko is tarah kii gadabadiyon se rokane kii koshish kerani chahie
 It is therefore necessary to double-check the security of critical digital machines such as evms

 The BJP released its manifesto on Monday
 is menifesto main hinduon se jude kuch muddon kaa bhi zikr kiya gaya he
 The international head of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Dr
 praveen togadiya ne is par pratikriya dete hue kaha ki ye bahut acchhee baat he
 According to Togadia, 'it is good that some issues related to Hindus have been mentioned in the bjp's manifesto now due to the strong demand of Hindus, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Hindu organizations
 jaise ki bhagwaan ram kaa mandir, dhara 370, samaan nagari kanoon, kashmiri pandit, gau-mata or gauvansh suraksha aadi
 He wrote in his response through a press release, "it is the expectation of Hindus, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Hindu organizations that all these issues should be done in a timely manner without being limited to the declaration
 jaise ki ayodhya main ram mandir par charchaaen aadi ke liye samay naa ganvaate hue sansad main kanoon paarit kar ram mandir nirmaan kiya jaae
 This section should be removed immediately by not conducting discussions on section 370
 keval alpsankhyak mahilaon ke kalyaan ke liye maryaadit samaan nagari kanoon na laate hue samaaj ke sabhi kshetron main samaan nagari kanoon lagu ho
 According to 'togadia,' the long-delayed rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits with respect and with full security and financial support should be in the same places by December 2014 where they were brutally repulsed from Kashmir
 govansh or gaumata hatya par puraa pratibandh lagane kaa kanoon sansad main turant paarit ho tabhi govansh vikaas kii baton kaa koi arth hoga

 'dr
 togadiya ne aage kaha, 'is ghoshnaa patr main hinduon kii kuch maangon kaa ullekh kiya gaya he

 bihar congress tut ko lekar itani bhaybheet he ki wo vidhayakon kaa pair pakadney ke liye bhi taiyaar he
 Kaukab Qadri, the provisional president of Bihar Congress in Patna, said that he will appeal to all those who are in the Congress today to remain in the party
 unhone kaha ki iske liye agar jarurat padegi or unke pair bhi pakadana padegaa, to main wo bhi karuunga
 After the disintegration of the Grand Alliance in Bihar, it was reported that now Bihar may also be broken in Congress
 congress ke kul 27 vidhayakon main se 18 tut ke liye taiyaar hai
 These reports of Bihar Congress also raised the ears of the Congress high command
 kuch vidhayakon ne tut kii puri jaankaree alaakaman tak pahunchaai
 It was told that none other than Tut is the leader of the Congress, the then Congress President Ashok Chaudhary
 maamle kii jaankaree ke baad aalaakaman ne isaki toh leni shuru kii
 After this, Ashok Chaudhary moved from the Good Book of the High Command to the Bad Book
 vahiin, congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne bihar ke sabhi vidhayakon ko dilli bulaayaa
 In two days, 20 out of 27 mlas reached Delhi to meet Rahul Gandhi
 sabase van-tu-van baatcheet hui
 Meanwhile, some things came to the fore
 alaakaman ne yah tay kar liya ki ashok choudhary ko adhyaksh pad se hataanaa he, lekin aglaa adhyaksh koun banegaa
 
 
 
 isko lekar uhapoh kii sthiti thi
 To avert this situation, the Congress high command has appointed Kadri, the state vice-president of the Congress, as the temporary president
 kadri kitne din adhyaksh rahenge, yah kahana mushkil he
 It may also happen that he stays in this post for two or four days only
 mana ja rahaa he ki congress ke kaddavar netaa akhilesh singh ko aglaa adhyaksh banaaya ja saktaa he
 Ashok Chaudhary also said that this temporary arrangement has been made to make a certain person president
 ashok choudhary shuru se hi akhilesh singh ke virodh main rahe hai
 The high command Congress leader knows that with Akhilesh Singh becoming president, the possibility of a split in the Congress can change with confidence
 lihaaja wo kuch or naam par vichaar kar saktaa he
 If the Congress makes a strategy keeping 2019 in mind, the Bihar Pradesh Congress can make the president senior or give a chance to the president of the Youth Congress
 rajya main ek baar congress or ek baar bhaajapa kii sarkaar banane kii ‘parampara' rahi he
 Its effect is visible on the Lok Sabha elections
 rajasthan main loksabhaa chunaavon ke parinaamon ko dekha jaae to 2004 se hi aisa rukh dekhne ko mila ki rajya main jis party kii sarkaar banati he, loksabhaa chunaav main usee ko zyada siten milti hai
 Whereas Lok Sabha elections usually take place about six months after the state assembly elections
 rajya main 2003 ke vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko 120 or congress ko 58 siten milin
 After this, in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the voters of the BJP put 21 seats out of 25
 chaar siten congress ko milin
 The 2008 Assembly election turned the dice
 congress ko 200 main 96 siten milin or ashok gahalot ne sarkaar banaai
 All the BSP mlas joined the Congress and got a majority
 vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ko 76 siten milin
 Just after this, in the Lok Sabha elections in 2009, Congress got 20 seats and BJP got four seats
 ek seat par nirdaleey kirodilal meena chune gaye jo us samay congress ke samarthak the
 Similarly, in the 2013 assembly elections, BJP got 163 seats and Congress was reduced to 21 seats
 loksabhaa chunaav ke parinaam to or bhi chaunkaane vaale rahe jab modi lahar ke bich rajya ke matadaataaon ne sari 25 siten bhaajapa ko de deen
 It is a different matter that the Congress won the by-elections in two seats last year
 pichley disambar main hue vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko rajya kii 200 main se 100 siten mili hai
 The BJP has 73 seats
 haalanki donon partiyon ko mili voton main antar keval lagbhag aadhe pratishat kaa he
 According to BJP sources, the party hopes that it will not allow this gap to increase in the Lok Sabha elections and will do well, breaking the tradition
 party ke rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah ne vidhansabha chunaav main party kii haar ke baad jaipur main apane pehle kaarykram main isaki ummid bhi jataai
 Polling for the Lok Sabha elections in the state is to be held in two phases on April 29 and May 6
 haryana schuli shiksha board ne 2017 kii pariksha ke liye aavedan karte samay 10veen or 12veen kaksha ke vidhyaarthiyon ke liye aadhaar card anivaary kar diya he
 Board President Jagbir Singh said in a statement on Thursday that this would benefit the candidates in many ways
 aadhaar ke istemaal se pramaan patron kaa farjivada rukegaa or yah sunishchit hoga ki ummidavaaron ke byore purna or sateek hai
 The comments singh ne kaha ki pehle main bhi pariksha kii prakriya main aadhaar kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha

 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) isse pehle ki aap modi kii kisaan sahaayta or rahul kii nunatam inakam guarantee par kushti main utren, yah jaan lenaa jaruri he ki desh ke sabhi rajnatik dalon ne yah maan liya he ki sarkari skiimon kii baraat se desh ke garibon kii jin dagi main apekshit roshni nahin pahunchi haiyahi vajah he ki record fasal samarthan mulya ke elaan ke baad modi sarkaar kisaan nakad sahaayta (chote seemaant kisaanon ko prati parivaar 6,000 rupye salanaa) dene par majaboor hui or garibon ke liye congress ko 6,000 rupye prati maah kii aay kaa vaada karnaa padaa
 The question is meaningless as to how such schemes will be implemented with the existing subsidy? India's independent financial market is stronger than any leader in the world
 ghate ke chalate saal ke bich main kharch kaatane vaali sarkaron ko aisi skiimon ke liye kharch kaa ganit badalanaa hoga chaahe vah modi kii kisaan sahaayta ho yaa congress kii inakam guarantee
 Therefore, let's move the debate forward
 pratispardhi raajnneeti bharat ko aise sudhaar kii dahalij par le ai he jisaki charchaa se hi sarkarein darati hai
 By changing the spending structure on the schemes, the huge corrupt structure of government departments can be eliminated
 isliye inakam guarantee kii bahes urf skiimon kii asafalataa kaa ilham behad keemtee he, jo agar nattejey tak pahunchi to sabase bada sudhaar hakeekat ban saktaa haimanmohan singh or narendra modi, donon hi ek ghat phisale hai
 The rush of government schemes increased and the result was cipher
 
 
 aarthik samiksha (2016-17) ke hawaale se kuch namoonay pesh hai—aakhri ginati tak kareeb 950 kendriya scimen centre ke bajet kii god main khel rahi thim, jin par jidipi (vartmaan mulya) ke anupaat main 5 fisadi (kareeb 7 lakh karod rupye) kaa bajet aavanton hota he
 Of these, 11 big schemes (MNREGA, grain subsidy, mid-day meal, village road, Prime Minister's Housing, Crop Insurance, Swachh Bharat, Sarva Shiksha etc
) get the highest allocation
 centre sarkaar kii skiimon main kuch to 15 saal or kuch 25 saal puraani hai
 After adding the schemes of the states, the number becomes very high
 —yah dard purana he ki skiimon ke phaayde jaruratmandon tak nahin pahunchate
 The government's own calculation shows that the districts where the poorest reside have the least benefits of the six major schemes (housing Scheme, Sarva Shiksha, mid-day Meal, Village Road, MGNREGA, Swachh Bharat), and where the poor were less Reached more resources
 —yahi vajah he ki kareeb 40 fisadi lakshith logon ko rashan pranali or 65 fisadi jaruratmandon ko manaregaa kaa laabh nahin miltaa
 This is also the condition of other schemes ie direct theft
 —modi sarkaar kii taaja skiimon (ujjwala, saubhaahgya) ke aankade bhi isaki tasdik karte hai
 If political parties dare to guarantee income, then show courage to stop five big subsidy schemes
 keval petro or anaaj sabsidi par jidipi kaa 1
 It costs 48 percent
 aisa karte hi logon ke haath main sidhe dhan pahunchane kaa rasta khul saktaa he or sarkaar kaa vishaal dhaancha simit ho jayega
 If the allocation of resources to the states is also linked to this and the state's scheme spending is limited, then this reform will actually bring budgetary discipline instead of increasing expenditure
 logon ke khate main sidhe dhan pahunchane kii vyavastha (debiti) sthapit ho chuki he
 The biggest proof of success of LPG subsidy in bank account
 is tark ke samarthan main paryaapt adhyayan uplabdh hai ki logon ke haath main dhan arthvyavastha main maang ko badhaata hagareebon ko nunatam aay ke saath shiksha, swasthya aadi jaruri sevaaon main nijee pratispardhaa or laagat main kami jaruri he
 This can be ensured by policy and regulatory measures
 yah sudhaar bhi lambey samay se lataka hua he
 Reduction in government spending and transparent regulation of the market is what the economy needs
 jis tarah 1991 main bharat kii aarthik nitiyaan lagbhag charmara chuki thim, thik vahi haalat sarkari kharch or kalyaan skiimon kii he
 The biggest challenge of this effort is their symbolism
 skiimon kii bheed ke kaaran kuch sau rupye kii pension, choti-si sahaayta yaa maamuli sa beemaa hi mumkin he
 Therefore, people are not interested in it and what they distribute does not have much effect
 desh ko tej aarthik vikaas ke saath adhiktam ek yaa do bade hitlabh vaali kalyaan scimen chahie
 No matter whether Modi or Congress do this, but this reform is inevitable

 People in India are saying that minorities are not being treated like equal citizens
 'imran khan ke bayaan par bhaajapa ne bhi un par palatwaar kiya
 The BJP said that giving knowledge of minority rights of Pakistan cultivating blood on the land of oppression and terrorism is a matter of 'sau rat kha ke cat haj ko chali'

 By speaking the dialogue of Sholay film, Bollywood comedian Asrani has kept the political ground of Etawah buzzing

 Here in Keshav Prasad Maurya's gathering, less and more people have gathered to see his helicopter standing at a distance
 sapa ke garh main is baar katheria banaam katheria kaa dilachasp siyaasi muqabla chal rahaa he
 From the BJP, former cabinet minister Ramshankar Katheria is pitted against the alliance's Kamlesh Katheria, while leaving the BJP to join the Congress, Ashok Dohra and Shambhu Dayal of the Progressive Samajwadi Party can make a political game of anyone
 bijepi ne ramshankar katheria kaa agra se tikat kaat kar itawa se chunaav ladaaya he
 In 2014, BJP candidate Ashok Kumar Doher of BJP got 4,39,646 votes
 sapa ke premadas katheria ko 2,66,700 vot, basapa ke ajay paal singh jatav ko 1,92,804 vot or congress ke hans mukhi kori ko mahaj 13000 vot mili the
 That is why Ramshankar Katheria is determined about his victory
 bijepi ummidavaar ramshankar katheria kehete hai ki is baar pichhali baar se badi jeet hasil hogi kyonki shivpal yadav kii party ke umidavaar gathbandhan ke vot kaatenge
 On the other hand, Professor Ramshankar Katheria is challenging the coalition candidate Kamlesh Katheria
 kamalesh katheria sapa ke purv saansad rahe premadas katheria ke bete hai
 If you look at Etawah's caste equations, the Etawah Lok Sabha has the highest number of 4 lakh Dalit voters out of 17 lakh voters, followed by about 2 lakh Brahmins, 1 lakh 80 thousand Yadavs and 1 lakh 30 thousand voters
 basapa kaa gathbandhan hone se kamalesh katheria kii ummaaden dalit, yadav or muslim voton par tiki he
 At the same time, Ram Shankar Katheria is also accused of an external candidate
 gathbandhan ke ummidavaar kamalesh katheria kehete hai ki ramshankar katheria agra se aae wo vahiin chale jaaenge
 There is an alliance from here and will win in Etawah, but making the political battle of Etawah interesting, leaving the BJP, Congress candidate Ashok Dohra and Shambhu Dayal Doher fighting Shivpal Yadav's party with BSP
 pichhali baar ashok dohare ne bijepi ke tikat par khaasi badi jeet hasil karke sapa se ye seat chin lee thi
 Therefore, they are also considered strong candidates in Etawah parliamentary constituency
 dalit votaron par agar dohare ummidavaaron ne send lagaai to iskaa phayda yaa nuksaan katheria ummidavaaron ko ho saktaa he
 But Ashok is very confident about his double victory
 congress ke pratyaashee ashok dohare kehete hai ki ham do lakh voton se itawa main jeet rahe hai hamaara muqabla kisi se nahin he
 Every party in Etawah has put its full strength
 yahaan aalu kisaanon kaa koi mudda nahin bas ek taraf modi kaa rashtrawaad or duusari taraf akhilesh yadav kii pratishtha bachaane kii ladaai ke aasapaas hi siyasat kii bayaar bah rahi he
