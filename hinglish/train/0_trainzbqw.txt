 Azam Khan, the cabinet minister of the Uttar Pradesh government, attacked him fiercely without naming the Gujarat Chief Minister and bjp's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki hamen pilla samajhane waalon ke haath main desh kii bagdor na di jaae
 Azam Khan also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi and Congress during this time
 narendra modi kaa naam liye bagaiyr ajam khan ne unpar jabardast waar karte hue kaha, 'main aapse kahana chaahunga ki jinke maathe par lahu ke daag hai, jo insaani katleam ke jimmedaar hai
 If those people ask you to run the country, then do not refer to such people
 hamen pilla kehane waalon ke hawaale desh mat karnaa
 Don't hand over the country to those who throw away our hats
 kyonki tumhaare sir par jo safa hoga wo hamaara armaan hamaari izzat hogi
 If our cap is respected with your fairness, then neither the cap will be safe nor safe
 'unhonen rahul gandhi ke us bayaan ko bhi aade haathon liya, jisamen rahul ne kaha tha ki sapa sarkaar jaanboojhkar pradesh main food security bill lagu nahin kar rahi he
 Azam Khan said, 'the shower is of stones of society on us
 hamaare upar iljaam he ki hamane danga karaayaa he
 Do you think that we would recommend a very small employee, or would like to harm him? Even if people like us do not have that much
 agar inhen bhi jaaya kar doge to tumhaare dil kii baat kehane vaala bahut dinon tak koi yahaan nahin aayega
 Azam Khan further said, 'those who have tried to spoil the atmosphere in UP
 hindu or musalamaanon ke naam par samaaj ko lahooluhaan karne kii koshish or bahut had tak kiya bhi
 Your society is not yet named in it
 main chahta hum ki ye sandesh bahut dur tak jaae
 There has been no less effort to fight and provoke you
 istemaal karne kii koi kam koshish nahin hui he
 But the rich and scheming could not succeed in provoking you
 'rahul gandhi par nishaanaa sadhate hue ajam khan ne kaha, 'rahul ne kal kaha ki food security bill ko upi sarkaar lagu nahin kar rahi he
 a person who is being told that he will be the Prime Minister of tomorrow
 wo itane bhi kanoon system se waakif na ho
 Shame on this person like me
 aapane parliament main is bill ko paas karaayaa
 Passed from Rajya Sabha passed from Lok Sabha
 uskaa ek lanbaa prosijar he, notiphecshan ke saath rajya sarkaron ke paas jayega
 The state government will pass orders, go to the district
 aapane upi sarkaar ko gaali dekar sirf upi sarkaar ko gaali nahin di he, balki apni samajhadaari kii taraf bhi sawalia nishaan uthaaya he ki desh kaa hone vaala pradhanmantri jaisaa kii congress sochati he, wo talimi etbaar se, jaankaree, sooyeeboojh se kam he
 'you went to Aligarh and Rampur called Muslim Basti,' Azam Khan said about the Congress election campaign
 aapane aise ilaake chune jahaan se ye sandesh jaae ki hamane apane chunaav abhiyaan kii shuruyaat bevakoof musalamaanon ke yahaan se kii he
 Because for 55 years we have ruled them by saying that they are the backbone
 ' Mr
 Ashutosh, main aaj dilli main nahin tha
 Devendra was recording with Sharma whether there could be any solution to this problem of farmers
 ham gehun ke murajhaae khet main ek maayoos kisaan ke saath baat kar rahe the
 We asked farmer Rampal Singh that if he walks in your field, what is left will also be finished
 pehle se maayoos rampal singh ne kaha ki koi baat nahin
 There is nothing left in it
 agar aapke chalane se duusare kisaanon ko phayda ho jaataa he to mujhe khushi hogi
 Anyway, now there is no cost to it, some work will come
 ye us kisaan kaa kahana he jo chahta he ki uski barbaadi ke hi bahaane sahi kam se kam samaadhaan par baat to ho
 Perhaps Gajendra gave his life with the same intention with which Rampal Singh gave his field for us
 ham isliye dilli se karnal aa gaye the ki samaadhaan par baat nahin ho rahi thi
 The Congress was open to all the debates of the BJP, but the matter was not moving forward
 maine sahyogi sharad sharma kii wo bhi report bhi dekhi thi ki dilli sarkaar ne bees hazaar rupee prati acre muawza dene kaa elaan kiya he lekin kisi kisaan ko muawza nahin mila he
 Your own MLA Devendra Sehrawat was one of the first leaders to act on this problem of farmers in and around Delhi
 agar mujhe thik-thik yaad he to devendra saharaavat ne media ko kai esemes kiya tha ki sthiti bahut karaab he
 Since then till date there is no public information about how many farmers have been compensated in Delhi
 jantar-mantar kii raily se do din pehle kii gai sharad sharma kii report bataati he ki vahaan koi survey karne vaala nahin gaya he
 The farmers have started cutting wheat so long as they waited
 shaayad dilli sarkaar bina survey ke hi chaoupaalon ke zariye kisaanon ko sidhe paisa dene kii baat kar rahi he
 Whether or not there has been such a chaupal, but have read the detailed report of the Mohalla Sabha in the newspapers
 chaoupal main vidhayak or pradhan ke bich logon se poochkar muawza dene kii baat vaaki nayab he
 If this is the case then the Delhi government should have distributed the compensation by now as it does not have to go through the long process of surveying and sending reports from Tehsildar to Collector like other governments
 vaise survey vaale rajyon main jahaan puraa survey bhale na hua ho centre sarkaar ko report de di gai he
 This is also a kind of fraud that is going on
 kair to kya aap bataa sakate hai ki centre sarkaar ko dilli sarkaar ne koi report bheji he yaa nahin
 The Delhi government has distributed money from the amount of twenty thousand per acre to how many farmers till the rally
 yah bataanaa isliye bhi zaruri he taaki yah baaki rajyon ke liye bhi nazir ban sake
 If the Delhi government can declare compensation by adding profits to the cost at the time of loss, should it be expected that it will pay the minimum support price more than the rest of the states
 agar centre sarkaar kaa koi kanoon aade nahin aata ho to
 All the committees on the farming crisis have suggested that the products should be purchased from the farmers at fixed prices by adding profits on the cost instead of the minimum support price
 dilli main haryana yaa uttar pradesh kii tarah kisaanon kii sankhya bhi utani nahin hogi isliye kya yah ummid kii ja sakati he is chote se rajya main aisa ho saktaa he
 My purpose in writing so much is that the farmers get some good on this excuse
 muaavze ke saath-saath kuch thos niti ban jaae
 That is why you must have seen that i started this article with you but not from your statement that you have given after Jantar Mantar incident
 acha kiya jo aapane maafee maang lee par kya aap yah bhi bataa sakate hai ki maafee maangane laayak bayaan dete vakt aap kis manodasha se guzar rahe the
 You will also be saddened by Gajendra's suicide, then how did such statements come out in times of grief
 kya aapako gussa aa gaya ki aatmahatya ko lekar aapke netaa ko gheraa ja rahaa he
 Journalists are asking why the rally continued after the suicide
 log to twitor par media se bhi puch rahe hai ki camere waalon ne kyon nahin dekha yaa bachaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Why angry kyon aapane kaha ki agar agali baar kuch aisa hoga to dilli ke mukhyamantri ped par chadh jaaenge or vyakti ko bachaa lenge
 You forgot that your chief minister used to talk about cutting wires by climbing on electric poles
 aap bhul gaye ki mukhyamantri hone ke baad bhi virdohi se lekar patrkaar asahaj sawaal puch sakate hai
 Questions can also be wrong
 sahi bhi ho sakate hai
 But in addition to expressing extra allegiance in this statement, this trend is also visible how the name of the Chief Minister was taken in this controversy
 mujhe lagata he ki agar sarkarein samaadhaan kii taraf badhengi to kisi ko gussa nahin aayega balki uske bheetar seva bhav jaagega
 The comments nishchit rup se is ghatana par raajnneeti ho rahi he jaise kisaanon kii dasha ko lekar raajnneetik reliyaan ho rahi hai
 i am not saying that you are responsible for the death of Gajendra or that any of you could have saved it by leaving the stage
 jo bhi he gajendra aapaki raily main aayaa tha isliye wo aapkaa mehmaan hone ke saath-saath sahyatri bhi he
 Did you know that in this rally, you have seen the great truth of politics about which he had written a letter
 gajendra ke liye koi ped par nahin chadh saktaa tha isiilie wo khud ped par chadh gaya
 The grief of the death of a hitchhiker does not reflect the statements made with frowns
 bhale hi bijepi yaa congress ke netaaon ne raajnneetik bayaan diye hon yaa un bayanon main bhi waisi krurta ho jaisi aapke is bayaan main nazar ai lekin gajendra kii maut sabhi sarkaron or samaajon ke liye sharmnaak he
 This is a time of collective shame and worry
 jantar-mantar or ramlila maidaanon ko chhod vaise hi raahat saamagree lekar kheton main jane kaa samay he jaise baaki aapadaaon ke vakt log jate hai
 i was not in Delhi today
 devendra sharma ke saath recording kar rahaa tha ki kisaanon kii is samasya kaa kya koi samaadhaan ho saktaa he
 We were talking with a dispirited farmer in a withering field of wheat
 hamane kisaan rampal singh se poocha ki aapke khet main chalenge to jo bachaa he wo bhi samaapt ho jayega
 Desperate Rampal Singh said beforehand that there is nothing
 isamen kuch bachaa nahin he
 i would be happy if other farmers benefit from your walk
 vaise bhi ab iskaa koi daam to milanaa nahin he, kuch kaam hi aa jaae
 This is the say of the farmer who wants that at least the right thing should be talked about on the pretext of his ruin
 shaayad gajendra ne bhi isi iraade se jaan de di jis iraade se rampal singh ne hamaare liye apana khet de diya
 We came to Karnal from Delhi because the solution was not being discussed
 congress bijepi kii tamaam bahason se sabakaa bahikhaata to khul rahaa tha magar baat aage nahin bad rahi thi
 i had also seen the report of colleague Sharad Sharma that Delhi government has announced compensation of Rs 20,000 per acre but no farmer has got compensation
 aapke hi vidhayak devendra saharaavat dilli or uske aas-paas kisaanon kii is samasya ko lekar harakat main aane vaale pehle netaaon main se the
 If i remember correctly, Devendra Sehrawat had sent many smses to the media that the situation is very bad
 tab se lekar aaj tak dilli main kitne kisaanon ko muawza diya gaya he isaki koi saarvajanik jaankaree nahin he
 Sharad Sharma's report done two days before the jantar-mantar rally shows that no surveyee has gone there
 kisaan kab tak intazaar karte lihaaza gehun kaatane lage hai
 Perhaps the Delhi government is talking about giving money directly to the farmers through chaupals without survey
 aisi koi chaoupal hui he yaa nahin magar mohalla sabha kii vistrut report akhbaaron main padhi he
 In Chaupal, the matter of asking the people for compensation by asking the people between the MLA and the head is really unique
 agar aisa he to dilli sarkaar ko ab tak muawza baant dena chahie tha kyonki use baaki sarkaron kii tarah survey karne or tehseeldaar se collector tak report bhejne kii lambii prakriya se nahin guzaranaa he
 In the surveyed states where the complete survey may not have been done, the report has been given to the central government
 yah bhi ek kism kaa farzivada he jo chal rahaa he
 Anyway, can you tell whether the Delhi Government has sent any report to the Central Government or not
 dilli sarkaar ne raily ke pehle tak kitne kisaanon ko bees hazaar prati acre kii raashi se paise baant die hai
 It is also important to state this so that it can become a Nazir for the rest of the states
 agar dilli sarkaar nuksaan ke vakt laagat main munaafaa jodakar muawza dene kaa elaan kar sakati he to kya usase yah ummid kii jaae ki vah nunemat samarthan mulya bhi baaki rajyon se zyada degi
 If no law of the central government comes in the way
 kheti sankat par bani tamaam cametiyon ne suzav diye hai ki nunatam samarthan mulya kii jagah laagat par munafa jodakar tay mulya par kisaanon se utpaada kharida jaae
 Delhi will not have the same number of farmers as Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, so can it be expected that this can happen in this small state
 itnaa sab likhane kaa meraa yahi makasad he ki isi bahaane kisaanon kaa kuch bhala ho jaae
 There should be some concrete policy along with compensation
 isiilie aapane dekha hoga ki maine is lekh kii shuruuaat aapse se to kii magar aapke us bayaan se nahin ki jo aapane jantar mantar kii ghatana ke baad diya he
 Well done, which you apologized, but can you also tell what mood you were going through while making an apology statement? gajendra kii aatmahatya se to aap bhi kaaphi dukhi honge phir dukh ke samay aise tevar vaale bayaan kaise nikal gaye
 Did you get angry that your leader is being surrounded by suicide
 patrkaar kyon puch rahe hai ki aatmahatya ke baad raily kyon chalati rahi
 People are also asking the media on Twitter why the cameras did not see or try to save
 kyon gussa aayaa
 Why did you say that if something happens next time, the Chief Minister of Delhi will climb the tree and save the person
 aap bhul gaye ki aapke hi mukhyamantri bijli ke khambhe par chadhakar taar kaatane kii baat karte the
 You forgot that even after being the chief minister, journalists can ask uncomfortable questions from opponents
 sawaal galat bhi ho sakate hai
 Can also be correct
 lekin is bayaan main atirikt nishtha jataane ke alaava yah pravriti bhi nazar aa rahi he ki mukhyamantri kaa naam is vivaad main kaise le liya gaya
 i think that if the governments move towards a solution, then no one will get angry but a sense of service will arise within it
 tippaniyan Certainly politics is taking place on this incident like political rallies are taking place regarding the condition of farmers
 main nahin kah rahaa ki gajendra kii maut ke liye aap zimmedaar hai yaa aapmen se koi manch chhodkar bachaa saktaa tha
 Whoever Gajendra came to your rally, that's why he is your guest as well as hitchhiker
 kya pataa usne is raily main raajnneeti ke us viraat satya ko dekh liya ho jiske bare main wo khat likhakar laayaa tha
 No one could climb a tree for Gajendra, that's why he climbed himself
 ek sahyatri kii maut kaa dukh tevar vaale bayanon se zaahir nahin karte
 Even if the leaders of BJP or Congress have given political statements or those statements have the same cruelty as seen in your statement, but Gajendra's death is shameful for all governments and societies
 yah samuhik shame or chintaa kaa samay he
 It is time to leave the jantar-mantar and Ramlila plains and go to the fields with relief material, just as people go during other disasters
 pehle se maayoos rampal singh ne kaha ki koi baat nahin
 There is nothing left in it
 agar aapke chalane se duusare kisaanon ko phayda ho jaataa he to mujhe khushi hogi
 Anyway, now there is no cost to it, some work will come

 patrkaar kyon puch rahe hai ki aatmahatya ke baad raily kyon chalati rahi
 People are also asking the media on Twitter why the cameras did not see or try to save
 kyon gussa aayaa
 Why did you say that if something happens next time, the Chief Minister of Delhi will climb the tree and save the person
 aap bhul gaye ki aapke hi mukhyamantri bijli ke khambhe par chadhakar taar kaatane kii baat karte the
 You forgot that even after being the chief minister, journalists can ask uncomfortable questions from opponents
 sawaal galat bhi ho sakate hai
 Can also be correct
 lekin is bayaan main atirikt nishtha jataane ke alaava yah pravriti bhi nazar aa rahi he ki mukhyamantri kaa naam is vivaad main kaise le liya gaya
 i think that if the governments move towards a solution, then no one will get angry but a sense of service will arise within it
 tippaniyan Certainly politics is taking place on this incident like political rallies are taking place regarding the condition of farmers
 main nahin kah rahaa ki gajendra kii maut ke liye aap zimmedaar hai yaa aapmen se koi manch chhodkar bachaa saktaa tha
 Whoever Gajendra came to your rally, that's why he is your guest as well as hitchhiker
 kya pataa usne is raily main raajnneeti ke us viraat satya ko dekh liya ho jiske bare main wo khat likhakar laayaa tha
 No one could climb a tree for Gajendra, that's why he climbed himself
 ek sahyatri kii maut kaa dukh tevar vaale bayanon se zaahir nahin karte
 Even if the leaders of BJP or Congress have given political statements or those statements have the same cruelty as seen in your statement, but Gajendra's death is shameful for all governments and societies
 yah samuhik shame or chintaa kaa samay he
 It is time to leave the jantar-mantar and Ramlila plains and go to the fields with relief material, just as people go during other disasters
 shaayad dilli sarkaar bina survey ke hi chaoupaalon ke zariye kisaanon ko sidhe paisa dene kii baat kar rahi he
 Whether or not there has been such a chaupal, but have read the detailed report of the Mohalla Sabha in the newspapers
 chaoupal main vidhayak or pradhan ke bich logon se poochkar muawza dene kii baat vaaki nayab he
 If this is the case then the Delhi government should have distributed the compensation by now as it does not have to go through the long process of surveying and sending reports from Tehsildar to Collector like other governments
 vaise survey vaale rajyon main jahaan puraa survey bhale na hua ho centre sarkaar ko report de di gai he
 This is also a kind of fraud that is going on
 kair to kya aap bataa sakate hai ki centre sarkaar ko dilli sarkaar ne koi report bheji he yaa nahin
 The Delhi government has distributed money from the amount of twenty thousand per acre to how many farmers till the rally
 yah bataanaa isliye bhi zaruri he taaki yah baaki rajyon ke liye bhi nazir ban sake
 If the Delhi government can declare compensation by adding profits to the cost at the time of loss, should it be expected that it will pay the minimum support price more than the rest of the states
 agar centre sarkaar kaa koi kanoon aade nahin aata ho to
 All the committees on the farming crisis have suggested that the products should be purchased from the farmers at fixed prices by adding profits on the cost instead of the minimum support price
 dilli main haryana yaa uttar pradesh kii tarah kisaanon kii sankhya bhi utani nahin hogi isliye kya yah ummid kii ja sakati he is chote se rajya main aisa ho saktaa he
 My purpose in writing so much is that the farmers get some good on this excuse
 muaavze ke saath-saath kuch thos niti ban jaae
 That is why you must have seen that i started this article with you but not from your statement that you have given after Jantar Mantar incident
 acha kiya jo aapane maafee maang lee par kya aap yah bhi bataa sakate hai ki maafee maangane laayak bayaan dete vakt aap kis manodasha se guzar rahe the
 You will also be saddened by Gajendra's suicide, then how did such statements come out in times of grief
 kya aapako gussa aa gaya ki aatmahatya ko lekar aapke netaa ko gheraa ja rahaa he
 Journalists are asking why the rally continued after the suicide
 log to twitor par media se bhi puch rahe hai ki camere waalon ne kyon nahin dekha yaa bachaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Why angry kyon aapane kaha ki agar agali baar kuch aisa hoga to dilli ke mukhyamantri ped par chadh jaaenge or vyakti ko bachaa lenge
 You forgot that your chief minister used to talk about cutting wires by climbing on electric poles
 aap bhul gaye ki mukhyamantri hone ke baad bhi virdohi se lekar patrkaar asahaj sawaal puch sakate hai
 Questions can also be wrong
 sahi bhi ho sakate hai
 But in addition to expressing extra allegiance in this statement, this trend is also visible how the name of the Chief Minister was taken in this controversy
 mujhe lagata he ki agar sarkarein samaadhaan kii taraf badhengi to kisi ko gussa nahin aayega balki uske bheetar seva bhav jaagega
 The comments nishchit rup se is ghatana par raajnneeti ho rahi he jaise kisaanon kii dasha ko lekar raajnneetik reliyaan ho rahi hai
 i am not saying that you are responsible for the death of Gajendra or that any of you could have saved it by leaving the stage
 jo bhi he gajendra aapaki raily main aayaa tha isliye wo aapkaa mehmaan hone ke saath-saath sahyatri bhi he
 Did you know that in this rally, you have seen the great truth of politics about which he had written a letter
 gajendra ke liye koi ped par nahin chadh saktaa tha isiilie wo khud ped par chadh gaya
 The grief of the death of a hitchhiker does not reflect the statements made with frowns
 bhale hi bijepi yaa congress ke netaaon ne raajnneetik bayaan diye hon yaa un bayanon main bhi waisi krurta ho jaisi aapke is bayaan main nazar ai lekin gajendra kii maut sabhi sarkaron or samaajon ke liye sharmnaak he
 This is a time of collective shame and worry
 jantar-mantar or ramlila maidaanon ko chhod vaise hi raahat saamagree lekar kheton main jane kaa samay he jaise baaki aapadaaon ke vakt log jate hai
 Anyway, can you tell whether the Delhi Government has sent any report to the Central Government or not
 dilli sarkaar ne raily ke pehle tak kitne kisaanon ko bees hazaar prati acre kii raashi se paise baant die hai
 It is also important to state this so that it can become a Nazir for the rest of the states
 agar dilli sarkaar nuksaan ke vakt laagat main munaafaa jodakar muawza dene kaa elaan kar sakati he to kya usase yah ummid kii jaae ki vah nunemat samarthan mulya bhi baaki rajyon se zyada degi
 If no law of the central government comes in the way
 kheti sankat par bani tamaam cametiyon ne suzav diye hai ki nunatam samarthan mulya kii jagah laagat par munafa jodakar tay mulya par kisaanon se utpaada kharida jaae
 Delhi will not have the same number of farmers as Haryana or Uttar Pradesh, so can it be expected that this can happen in this small state
 itnaa sab likhane kaa meraa yahi makasad he ki isi bahaane kisaanon kaa kuch bhala ho jaae
 There should be some concrete policy along with compensation
 isiilie aapane dekha hoga ki maine is lekh kii shuruuaat aapse se to kii magar aapke us bayaan se nahin ki jo aapane jantar mantar kii ghatana ke baad diya he
 Well done, which you apologized, but can you also tell what mood you were going through while making an apology statement? gajendra kii aatmahatya se to aap bhi kaaphi dukhi honge phir dukh ke samay aise tevar vaale bayaan kaise nikal gaye

 com / kirpvh7xfx CM Manohar Parrikar of Goa has been ill for a long time and is undergoing treatment
 lekin ve koun si beemaari se grast hai, yah kisi ko nahin pataa he kyonki is bare main aadhikarik taur par kuch nahin bataaya ja rahaa tha
 Only such statements were coming from Govasarkar that Parrikar's condition is now improving and he will start coming to his office as soon as possible
 shanivaar ko pehali baar goa ke mantri vishwajit rane ne kaha kimanohar parriurko pancreatic cancer hai
 This is not hidden
 unhen unke parivaar ke saath shantipurvak rahane diya janaa chahie
 They have every right
 goa ke logon kii seva karne ke baad, agar ve apane parivaar ke saath kuch vakt bitaana chaahate hai to kisi ko unase poochne kaa sarokaar nahin he
 No statement was issued by the government regarding Parrikar's health
 sarkaar kii taraf se keval itnaa kaha gaya ki parrikar biimaar hai or uske ilaaj ke liye unhone pehle mumbai ke leelavati aspataal or uske baad america main ilaaj karaayaa
 After this, they are taking treatment at AIIMS in Delhi
 bataa den ki manohar parrikar lambey vakt se biimaar chal rahe hai, jis vajah se he goa kaa prashasnic kaamkaaj kaaphi had tak thap padaa hua he
 Goa Congress, while targeting many times, asked why no medical bulletin was taken out by the government regarding Parrikar's health? Goa Congress had also alleged that Parrikar is not taking any kind of cabinet decisions, so how to clear the files Is happening goa congress ke kai netaaon ne siem se milane kii bhi koshish kii thi
 It is said that he wanted to meet CM and ask about his health
 gauratlab he ki dilli ke ames aspataal se discharge milane ke baad manohar parrikar haal hi main goa laute hai
 They are taking treatment under the supervision of a doctor of Goa Medical College at their residence in dona-pola, Goa
 is bich siemo se yahi statement phir jari kiya gaya ki parrikar ricover ho rahe hai or jald hi apane offis lautenge
 On 30 October, Parrikar called a Goa government cabinet meeting at his own home
 parrikar par yahaan sawaal isliye bhi uthaaya ja rahaa he ki agar parrikar apane do cabinet mantriyon kii beemaari ke chalate unka mantri pad chin sakate hai to khud kii beemaari ke chalate maheenon se apane daftar tak nahin jane ke baavjood ve apana istipha kyon nahin de rahe?philhal rajya main mukhyamantri kii kursi koun sanbhaalega ise lekar bhaajapa main hi bhram ke halaat hai
 It is said that the party president Amit Shah is looking for a leadership who should also act like Parrikar and the two constituents ie Goa Forward and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak go along
 haalanki bhaajapa ke liye mushkilen kam hone kaa naam nahin le rahi hai
 On the one hand Sudhin Dhavalikar, leader of the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Paksha, wants somewhere to be the Chief Minister, on the other hand, the Goa Forward Party has directly stated that he supported Parrikar and not the BJP
 ab yah bhaajapa netaaon kii jimmedaari he ki agar parrikar biimaar chal rahe hai to goa main sushasan bana rahe or yah sarkaar apane 5 saal puraa karen
 It will be interesting to know what Parrikar says to his cabinet colleagues in the cabinet meeting to be held on October 30? According to sources, CM can expand his cabinet in the meeting
 philhal unke paas grih mantralay, vitt mantralay jaise mahatvapurn mantri pad hai, jiskaa padbhaar ve goa forward yaa phir sudin dhavlikar ko de sakate hai

 The by-elections in Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats have given shocking results
 in nateezon ke kai myne nikaale ja rahe hai or utane hi spashtikaran bhi die ja rahe hai
 UP Chief Minister Adityanath is saying that the Bharatiya Janata Party lost due to over-confidence
 purv mukhyamantri or samaajawaadee party ke netaa akhilesh yadav kaa kahana he ki yah vikalp kii jeet he, saamaajik nyaay kii jeet he
 SP and allies win
 lekin jeet kii ye samiksha suvidhanusaar hi pesh kii ja rahi he
 The story seems to go much further than this
 upachunaav ke nateezon ke kai myne hai
 The first thing is that the BJP has lost
 yogi haare hai
 Modi is a loser
 varanaa ek do-tihaai bahumat vaali mahaj ek saal puraani sarkaar or centre main bhi usee party kii sarkaar ke pratyaashee apni jiti hui siton par chunaav kyon haar jate
 The bigger reason is that Gorakhpur is the seat of Yogi who is the Chief Minister of the state and Phulpur is the seat of Keshav Prasad Maurya who is the Deputy Chief Minister of the state
 inaki siton par haar bhaajapa ke liye kisi or seat par hone vaali haar se kahin badi he
 The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party may be feeling relieved that this is a mandate that has come as a cool breeze for them, but the truth is that people have not won the SP-BSP, Modi and Yogi Voted to teach a lesson to sabak sikhaane ke liye ek vikalp logon ko chahie tha jisamen bhaajapa kii lahar se takkar lene kii kshamta kaa mataganit ho
 The bsp's support to the SP created that scope and the people shattered the bjp's teeth
 ise bhi padhein
 
 
 INSIDE STORY: Know what happened in the meeting of Akhilesh and Mayawati, the BJP will reiterate that it has nothing to do with Yogi and Modi's performance
 lekin darasal yah ladaai parformens or antarkalah kii hi he
 The list of works done in exchange for the height to which Modi has taken the world of dreams to a height is dwarf
 kisaanon, naujavaanon kii takalif auki badi he
 Demonetisation and GST have broken the back of both the working and working class
 yogi hatyaein karaane ke alaava or kuch nahin kar paa rahe hai
 Neither the question of electricity is solved, nor are the deaths of children stopped
 gaddha mukt sadak or sabakaa vikaas ke naare jhuthe sabit hue hai
 Modi is running the power on the basis of dreams and yogi fears
 lekin donon hi chizein bahut din tak satta kaa singhaasana sambhaal nahin paati hai
 The mandate is proof of this
 is janadesh main party kii kalah kii kahani pramaan main badal gai he
 Talking to the press after the defeat, Keshav Maurya even said that Phulpur had won BJP only once, Gorakhpur had been BJP for decades, yet we have lost
 wo darasal us tis kii awaz thi jo uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon se lekar abtak unke andar bhari hui he
 Under his convenorship, BJP contested the 2017 assembly elections
 unke naam kii charchaa mukhyamantri pad ke liye baaraha hoti rahi
 But Chhika Yogi took the loot
 tab se lekar aaj tak yogi or maury apni apni gaddi se apane apane tareeke se soobe kii sarkaar ko haank rahe hai
 Such things were discussed among the people that Yogi wants Keshav to defeat Phulpur
 keshav maury kii seat par party kii haar yogi ko keshav ke saapeksh or bada kar detii
 On the other hand, the struggle of Brahmin versus Kshatriya was reaching its peak in Gorakhpur
 ise santulit karne ke liye bhaajapa ne mahendra pandey ko bhaajapa kaa pradesh adhyaksh banaaya or kai maheenon kii rassakasi ke baad yogi kii salaah ke bina ek pandit ko gorakhpur seat se pratyaashee banaaya
 Yogi was distracted by this
 nateeja yah rahaa ki na to phulpur main bhaajapa kaaryakarta puure aatmavishvaas se bhare dikhe or na hi gorakhpur main yogi kii hindu yuva vahini prachaar main sakriyata se kudi
 Even if these things are the same, but such things are important in spoiling the atmosphere
 yogi or bhaajapa inhen roak na sake

 dafn ho gai 23 saal puraani dushmani, nai dosti kii gavaah he ye tasveerjis gorakhpur main bhaajapa haari he wo yogi kii seat he or yogi lagbhag har saptaah gorakhpur pahunche rahete hai
 So, did the Chief Minister of the state and the Mahant of Gorakhpur not see the mandate shifting after the historic victory
 kya yogi ne yah nahin sochaa hoga ki unki marzi ke vipareet ek pandit ko tikat dekar bhaajapa unke kshatriyavaad or varchasv ko kamazor karnaa chaahati he
 If the BJP candidate had won in Gorakhpur, it would have worked to bring a balance in the battle of the Forwards there
 lekin aisa hua nahin or isiilie gorakhpur main bhaajapa kii haar yogi kii haar se bhi badi he
 The defeat is also worrisome because there is more dissatisfaction of party workers and supporters than dissatisfaction of the people
 kaaryakarta lagaataar upeksha kii shikaayat karte aa rahe hai
 The supporters are completely unhappy with the Yogi's style of governance
 aise main zamin par kaam karne ke liye jo team bhaajapa ko chahie thi, wo kamazor pad gai
 If the BJP bypasses this challenge, then it can have an impact on next year's elections as well
 modi ke liye yah haar acchhee or buree khabar, donon hi roopon main dekhi jaaegi
 Good because Yogi, who has an ambition to become his successor, has sat on his knees in his own stronghold
 is tarah yogi ke badhate kad ko modi ne phir se chota kar diya he
 The problem of Yogi is also that leaving Gorakhpur neither Gorakhpur is fully under his control nor he is able to handle the throne of Lucknow well
 hindu yuva vahini ek saal ke bheetar hi kamazor padane lagi he
 The by-election defeat in Gorakhpur has become a proof of his weak position
 modi ke liye yah acchhee khabar he

 gorakhpur upachunaav: brahman banaam thakur kii raajnneeti main haari bijepi!lekin modi ke liye yah buree khabar isliye he ki tripura kii jeet kaa gulaal feekaa padane se pehle hi in upachunaavon kii haar ne bhaajapa ko zamin par patake diya he
 Modi's magic seems to be weakened by the bjp's defeat in the by-elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and now Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, after Gujarat's poor victory
 kam se kam aam matadaata to ise isi rup main dekhegaa
 In Karnataka, voters will read this by-election message in a similar way
 or aisa hona modi ke liye katai acha sanket nahin he
 If this trend increases like this, it will be very difficult for Modi to maintain his air in 2019
 darasal, in parinaamon ke baad modi yah zarur sochenge ki janata par jaadu ke liye unhen ab kya nae raste akhriyaar karne kii zarurat he
 Because they too will be able to see that the old game of magic is not going to woo the public anymore
 janata jaadu ke saapeksh chaar saal ke unke pradarshan ko rakhkar mulyankan karegi or dekhegi ki kya vaaki badi baton vaala netaa bade kaam kar paa rahaa he
 The results of the by-elections are reflected in the steam of this assessment
 aisa bhi nahin he ki ye nattejey sapa-basapa ke bich ke samjhaute kii jeet he
 However, the coming together of the two parties after 23 years is a historic improvement
 lekin upachunaav main jeet ek shuruaati sanket bhar he
 And this sign is less confession with these two parties, more angry with BJP
 haa, samjhaute ne logon ko vikalp diya he
 But both parties still have to work hard to take this option forward
 logon ke bich bhi or partiyon ke bheetar bhi

 After the results of 2 states, 5 elections and only Bhabhua's saffron election, now the BJP and the Sangh will have to think how long a leadership looking at a big state like Uttar Pradesh with a caste prism will be able to maintain power and popularity
 akhilesh ke samay logon main bhram tha ki sarkaar koun chalaa rahaa he- akhilesh, shivpal, mulaayam yaa aazam khan
 The same confusion persists even by the present BJP government
 naukarshahi se lekar logon tak yah bhram pasra he
 Yogis resort to fear to break it, but in doing so they look very limited and narrow
 bhaajapa ko iskaa samaadhaan khojna hoga
 At the same time, the SP and the BSP also have to think that they are ready to make sacrifices for the hope that the people have raised, or they have once again become a failed formula in their efforts to save their important and domination
 or congress ko sochna hoga ki dilli main vipaksh ke dinar kii tablon se aage badhkar kab raajnneetik samajhadaari kaa dayera wo anya vipakshi dalon ke saath zamin tak le ja paaenge
 They are also protecting themselves

 unhone bataaya ki jamscook duniya ke sheersh 200 sansthaanon main bhi shaamil he
 Academic members of the university who visited India said that the fees of Jameskook University are not only lower than other universities in Australia but housing is also available at very affordable rates
 jesiyu ke college of science va ejineering main associat dean professor paul darks ne kaha, "na sirf kam kharch ke kaaran vidhyaarthee jesiyu kaa chayan karte hai, balki vishvavidhyalay main chaatr or academik sadsy kaa anupaat kam hona ek badi vajah he, jiske kaaran vah is santhaan ko variyata dete hai
 "he said," Students from all over the world study here which gives them a better environment here
 " vishvavidhyalay main international recruitment vibhaag ke pramukh vighnesh vijayraghavan ne bataaya ki vishvavidhyalay main 'master of global deveopment of data science' naam se ek nayaa kaarykram shuru kiya gaya he, jo ek antar-vidhaayi paathyakram he, jisamen naukariyon kii sambhaavna zyada hogi
 He said that undergraduate and postgraduate courses are offered in the university, which gives a lot of benefit to the meritorious students
 raghavan ne batya ki graduate main 70 fisadi yaa usase adhik ank laane vaale chaatro ko postagraduate kaaryakramon main 700 austrailian dollar masik scolership yani chaatravrutti di jaati he

 (input - IANS) gujarat ke chunavi samar kaa teesraa round shuru ho chukaa he
 The first round was during the Rajya Sabha elections, when the BJP plagued the Congress and the Congress veteran Ahmed Patel had to be chewed to win
 iske baad doosraa round aayaa chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan kaa
 This was the time when the Congress entered the elephant's trunk like an ant from the 'vikas Pagla Gaya Hai' campaign
 kam se kam soshal media ki trending se to aisa hi laga
 Players like Alpesh Thakor and Hardik Patel were also seen pulling the bjp's leg
 ab tisare round shuru ho gaya he or pehla mukka bhaajapa ne dharaa he
 With this, the edge of the war is seen to be sharp and sharp
 aanan fanan main raat main bulaai gai pressvarta main gujarat ke CM vijay rupani ne sandigdh IS agent kii giraftaar kaa zikr karte hue ahamed patel kaa naam lekar sabko chaunkaa diya he
 Barring the pinnacle of allegations, along with this, a game-changing card game of polarization politics has been given
 bhaajapa ne tir to andhere main chalaaya he, lekin nishaanaa sonia gandhi ke raajnneetik salaahkaar or lambey samay tak party ke sankatmochak rahe ahamed patel par he
 This is part of the bjp's well thought out strategy
 chot vahaan karo yaa us par karo jo gandhi parivaar kaa vishwasaneey ho
 But it has the potential to make an impact on the 2019 race if the arrow hits the target
 2007 main ulataa padaa tha sonia kaa tiradrasal 2002 ke dangon ne gujarat kii siyasat kaa huliya hi badal diya
 The 'death dealer' jumla, which came out of Sonia Gandhi's quiver in the 2007 elections also backfired for the Congress
 har baar chunavi reliyon main vikaas se baat shuru jarur hoti he par chunaav khatm hote hote hindu-musalmaan par aakar thahar jaati he
 It is unfortunate that in a progressive and literate state like Gujarat, the politics of polarization is heavy on the common man
 GST, notebandi se post he bijepimagar is baar muqabla thodaa dilachasp he
 The BJP is burdened with GST and demonetisation
 us par jati andolan kii chot or baadh kaa kahar bhi he
 This is the reason that once again BJP is remembering nationalism, terrorism and Gujarati identity
 vahiin gujarat main 22 saal ke siyaasi akaal ke baad kambek kii firaaq main lagi congress khud bhi isi maansikta main kaid he
 This is the reason why Rahul Gandhi is remembering God more during the campaign

 It has to be seen that in this historic election, to whom the public says Kai Po Che! congress somvaar ko sansad main maharashtra ke mudde ko uthaane kii taiyaari main he or isi sandarbh main party adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke awaas par party ke sansadeey ranneetik samooh kii baithak hui
 According to sources, the party leaders have proposed an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha
 unhone bataaya ki sonia gandhi ke awaas par isi mudde ko lekar baithak hui jisamen loksabhaa main congress ke netaa adheer ranjan choudhary, rajyasabha main netaa pratipaksh gulam nabi aaazaad or sanghathan mahasachiv kasee venugopal maujuud the
 Let me tell you, in the unprecedented political developments in Maharashtra, the Governor on Saturday morning administered oath to Devendra Fadnavis as Chief Minister and Ajit Pawar as Deputy Chief Minister
 iske baad se shivasena, congress or rakanpa apane-apane vidhayakon ko mumbai ke alag-alag hotalon main rakhaa he
 These three parties have also approached the Supreme Court to form the BJP government and have demanded a floor test to prove the majority
 ravivaarako teenon partiyon kii ore se daayar yachika par sunwaayee karte hue supreme court ne floor test karaae jane kaa aadesh to nahin diya tha, lekin centre sarkaar se rajyapal ko die gaye samarthan patr or sarkaar banane ke liye bheje gaye nimantran patr ko somvaar ko pesh karne ko kaha he
 Today, the Supreme Court is going to hear the matter again at 10:30 am
 dilli main rajyasabha siton kii teen siten hai
 On January 27, the term of sitting Congress members Janardan Dwivedi, Parvez Hashmi and Karan Singh is coming to an end
 nae rajyasabha sadasyon ko dilli vidhansabha ke sadasyon dwaara chunaa jayega
 There are 67 members of the Aam Aadmi Party and three members of the BJP in the assembly
 aap ke baari bahumat kaa matlab he ki yah teenon siten use hasil ho sakati hai
 At the moment it needs candidates
 bijepi netaa subramanyam swami ne congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi kii beti priyanka gandhi ke bare main ek aapattijanak tippanee kii he
 Swamy was vocal on Priyanka Gandhi's speculation of contesting against bjp's PM candidate Narendra Modi
 unhone kaha ki priyanka gandhi badnaam hai or bahut zyada sharaab piti hai
 If she had contested from Varanasi, she would have had a bad situation
 swami bole ki congress ne priyanka gandhi ko bachaa liya
 They would have been badly defeated
 vah bahut alokapriy hai
 Drinks too much alcohol
 vah or unke pati bahut badnaam hai
 On Sunday too, Swami made a strong comment on Priyanka Gandhi
 unhone priyanka ko kritagn beti qaraar diya tha
 The remark was made in the context of Priyanka going to jail to meet her father's killers
 pichley dinon sultanpur main road sho ke dauraan priyanka gandhi ne kaha tha ki meraa bhai varun bhatak gaya he
 Swami appeared to backfire on this too
 vah bole ki varun nahin priyanka or unki party bhatak gai he
 Those people are unable to digest Varuna's success
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ne ek baar phir rafel deal ko lekar piem modi or rakshaamantri nirmala sitaraman par sawaal uthaaya he
 The Congress president says that there has been some game behind the curtain on this deal, and Sitharaman is working under pressure from someone to suppress it
 darasal ravivaar ko rafel deal ko lekar rahul ne twit ke jariye piem modi par nishaanaa saadhaa, unhone loksabhaa main aviswas prastaav ke dauraan apane bhaashan main kahi baat doharaai
 If Rahul is to be believed, the defense minister is not able to keep the right things about anyone's pressure on the Rafale deal
 jabaki piem modi ko lekar twit main likhaa he ki unki sansad main muskuraahat ke peeche ek ghabrahat najar ai, isliye wo meri taraf nahin dekh paa rahe the
 Certainly, the suspicion of scandal in the Rafale deal is now deepening
 rafel kaa daam poochne par piem asahaj ho jate hai
 Our Defense Minister said she would, but now she won't
 She flip flops between “it’s-not-a-secret” & “it’s-a-big-secret”
 The PM squirms when asked about the price of RAFALE and refuses to look me in the eye
 Sure smells like a scam
 # rafalescam— Rahul Gandhi (@rahulgandhi) July 22, 2018 Notice of breach of privilege against Rahul
 The BJP is in retaliation for Rahul's statement on Rafale deal
 bijepi ke chaar saansadon ne rahul gandhi ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan kaa notice diya he

 rahul gandhi ne aarope lagaaya tha ki sitaraman ne yah kahkar desh ko gumraah kiya ki france ke saath hue rafel sauda maamle main bharat gopneeyata sharton se bandhaa hua he
 During the motion of no confidence, Congress President Rahul Gandhi, in the Lok Sabha during the no-confidence motion, said that Rahul had raised the issue in the Parliament, accusing the government of speaking "lies" to the country on the issue of sharing details of the Rafale deal, saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleged corruption In the cases of "partners", not "watchmen"
 loksabhaa main rajg sarkaar ke khilaaf avishvaas prastaav par bahes ke dauraan rahul ne apane bhaashan main kaha ki france ke raashtrapati ne ek baithak ke dauraan unase saaf saaf kaha tha ki 58,000 karod rupee ke rafel ladaaku vimaan se sambandhit byore saajha karne main koi dikkat nahin he
 Hours after Rahul Gandhi's remarks, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the security agreement signed with India in 2008 is confidential and that the confidentiality between the two countries is safeguarded in relation to the operational capabilities of defense equipment legally
 Is binding to
 haalanki unhone yah saaf nahin kiya ki kya samjhaute ke praavdhaan bharat sarkaar ko rafel saude se jude keemat ke byore kaa khulaasa karne se rokte hai
 The Congress has been alleging corruption in the Rafale deal and has sought details including the cost of equipment and weapons, but the government has refused to share the details, citing a confidential agreement with France
 rahul ne kathith bhrashtachar ke mudde par sarkaar par karaara hamalaa karte hue modi par bhi nishaanaa saadhaa
 He said, 'I can see him smiling, there is a glimpse of nervousness
 vah dur dekh rahe hai, meri ankhon main nahin dekh rahe
 On Rahul's remarks, opposition from the ruling party intensified following which opposition members stood up from their seats and confronted him
 rahul sansad main kaha tha ki raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman pradhanmantri ke dabaav main desh se jhooth bol rahi hai
 He said that whose help is being given, why is it being done, Nirmalaji, tell the Prime Minister of the country
 haalanki raksha mantri nirmala sitaraman ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ke is aarope ko puri tarah galat qaraar diya ki rafel vimaan saude ke sandarbh main france or bharat ke bich gopneeyata kaa koi samjhauta nahin hua he
 Sitharaman said that India and France had reached an agreement in 2008 to buy fighter aircraft

 Insisting that the scope of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) be separated, the BJP today said that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's offer to appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament made no sense
 haalanki piesi ke adhyaksh murali manohar joshi ne spasht kiya he ki 2
 Their panel is working independently to investigate the Zee spectrum case
 bhaajapa ke varisht netaa joshi kii raay loksabhaa main vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj se alag dikh rahi he
 Sushma argues that the PAC cannot call even a minister, the Prime Minister should be left out
 unhone twit kiya he,loksabhaa niyamon ke anusaar piesi kisi mantri ko bhi nahin bula sakati, pradhanmantri kii to baat hi dur he
 In such a situation, the offer of the Prime Minister has no meaning
 ‘ unka bayaan singh kii us peshkash ke ek din baad aayaa he jisamen pradhanmantri ne joshi ko patr likhakar piesi ke samaksh pesh hone ko taiyaar rahane kaa zikr kiya he
 Joshi is not very enthusiastic about the JPC demand campaign
 unhone kal hi kaha tha ki singh kii peshkash par piesi niyamon or prakriyaaon ke tahat ‘ uchit samay par uchit faisla karegi
 Sushma said that the scope of PAC is completely different from JPC
 piesi jahaan lekha se sambandhit he vahiin jepisi shashan or javabdehi se judaa hua he
 As per Lok Sabha rules, a 22-member PAC cannot summon a minister to testify
 lekin samiti ke adhyaksh jaanch ke kisi mudde par mantri se anaupchaarik baatcheet kar sakate hai
 The Prime Minister's offer is an unprecedented case
 aise main loksabhaadhyaksh ko is sambandh main prakriya par vichaar karnaa pad saktaa he

 So Sorry: rahul kii escape velociticsho Sorry: modi kaa tutaa sapana Rohit Sharma was dismissed for 91 runs (rohit sharma) in the Champions Trophy (ICC champions trophy 2017) against Pakistan
 teji se ek ran lene kii koshish main rohit sharma ran out ho gaye
 Although Rohit Sharma's bat reached the crease, his bat was in the air at that time
 is vajah se tisare ampire ne rohit sharma ko out qaraar diya gaya
 Actually, the Marilbourne Cricket Club (MCC), which sets the rules of cricket, has made many changes in the rules of cricket
 ran out lekar bhi ek badlaav kiya gaya he
 The changed rules will come into effect from October 1, 2017
 pehle yah niyam, jab gend stump main lagati he tab ballebaaj kaa bat yaa body, popping krij main jameen par honi chahie
 That is, if the batsman has already grounded his bat or body in the popping crease, but his ball or body is in the air when the ball is on the stump, then he was given out
 nae niyam ke tahat balla or body ek baar popping krij cross kar letaa he to ballebaaj ko out nahin diya jaayegaa chaahe gend stump main lagate vakt uskaa balla hawa main hi kyon na ho
 If this rule had come into force now, Rohit Sharma would not have been out
 maaloom ho ki ravivaar ko bharat or pakistan ke bich kaa mahamuqabla ekatarfa banakar rah gaya
 Team India, led by Virat Kohli, defeated Pakistan by 124 runs (duckworth Lewis Rule), performing brilliantly in both batting and bowling
 barish ke kaaran yah match kai baar baadhit hua
 Batting first at the invitation of Pakistan, Team India scored 319 runs in the stipulated 48 overs
 chaar ballebaajon ne ardhashatak banaae
 Rohit Sharma contributed the maximum 91, Virat Kohli 81 not out, Shikhar Dhawan 68 and Yuvraj Singh contributed 53 runs
 harfanmaulaa hardik pandya ne bhi 6 gend par naabad 20 ran kaa yogadan diya
 The comments baad main barish ke kaaran lakshya ko do baar sanshodhit karnaa padaa
 First Pakistan was given the target to score 324 runs in 48 overs, but this goal also had to be changed
 baad main barish ke kaaran lakshya ko sanshodhit kar 41 over main 289 ran diya gaya
 In response, the Pakistani team was dismissed for just 164 runs
 wahaab riyaj chot (absent hart) ke kaaran batting ke liye nahin utre
 Among Pakistani batsmen, Azhar Ali's 50 and Mohammad Hafeez's 33 runs were notable
 bharat kii ore se umesh yadav ne sarvaadhik teen wicket liye
 Yuvraj Singh was the man of the match, scoring 53 runs off 32 balls in the match
 yani agar ballebaaj pehle se popping krij main apane bat yaa body ko grounded kar chukaa he, lekin jab gend stump par lagi tab uskaa balla yaa body hawa main he to use out diya jaataa tha
 Under the new rule, once the bat and body cross the popping crease, the batsman will not be given out even if his bat is in the air while the ball is stumped

 Heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected in Mumbai and Maharashtra in the next 48 hours
 mangalvaar ko mumbai, pune sahit maharashtra bhar main diwaar girane se 31 logon kii maut ho gai
 Last week in Pune, 17 people died after a wall collapsed
 media report ke anusaar barish ke kaaran maharashtra bhar main diwaar girane se 46 logon kii maut hui he
 In Mumbai itself, more than 25 people have died in different accidents due to rain
 ye sabhi mazdoor hai isliye maatr sankhya hai
 The rainfall that has been received in Mumbai on 30 June and 1 July is the highest in ten years
 july bhar main jitani barish hoti he utani barish mumbai main sirf do dinon ke bheetar ho gai he
 On July 2, there was heavy rainfall due to which many areas were flooded
 mahanagar main saarvajinak chuttee kii ghoshnaa kar di gai he
 Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said that there has been so much rain on only two occasions in the last 45 years
 iske pehle 26 july 2005 ko barish hui thi
 At that time there was 944 millimeters of rain, according to media reports, 1100 people died
 is baar kii barish bhi kam nahin he lekin lagata he ki taiyaari kuch behatar he isliye janmaal kaa nuksaan 2005 kii tarah nahin he
 The rainfall that has been received in the last 24 hours is the highest in 10 years
 hawaii udaanen buree tarah prabhavit hai
 On June 3, there was a report by the Hindustan Times about the preparation before the rain
 em es ehsaanpriya ne likhaa he ki 2017 or 2018 main mumbai main 273 baadh prabhavit kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai thi
 Preparations have been completed in 178 of these areas before the monsoon
 is report main samvaadadaata ne biemasi ke starm water department ke ejeeniyar se baat kii he
 The engineer has stated that the capacity of the rainwater stream is only 50 millimeters of water in an hour
 agar barish 100 millimetre yaa 150 millimetre ho gai to phir baadh ko roka nahin ja saktaa he
 The rainfall in Mumbai has been more than 150 millimeters in the last three days
 2 july kii subah tak 375 millimetre barish hui he
 It has received 550 mm of rain in its first two days
 july bhar kii barish do dino main ho gai he
 If there is so much rain, it is evident that the rainy drains of Mumbai will not be able to drain the water
 biemasi kii site se pataa chalata he ki is baar samdanr main 17000 million litre barsaat kaa pani daalaa he
 Obviously the system must be doing some work as well
 hamaare sahyogi sohit mishra ne bataaya ki 24 ghanton main 53 jagahon par jalajmav hua he
 These are low-lying areas
 yani sayan, maatoonga, chembur, andheri, khaar, kurlaa, ghatkoper, santakruj
 Darryl d'monte, who is lifelong people and systems aware of Mumbai's environment, is no longer in the world
 lekin unheen kaa ek purana lekh he scrol dot in
 He has written that in June 1985, Mumbai received more than 1000 mm of rainfall in a month
 uske baad biemasi ne british conslatent watsan hoxle ko niyukt kiya ki ve shahar kii yojana bana kar den ki ek ghante main 50 millimetre barish ho jaae to kaise nipta jaae
 The report was prepared after eight years, but BMC took another 12 years to implement
 karodon kaa bajet he
 Their accounts are not available
 is vakt biemasi kaa daawa he ki 160 ilaakon ko jalajmav se mukt kara diya gaya he
 Since 1985, Mumbai's rain has been continuously warning
 maheene bhar kii barish ek din yaa do din main hone lagi he
 The rain of 26 July 2005 was covered for several days on news channels
 media report ke anusaar 700 log maare gaye the
 Even after this, we have gone away from the dreadful memories of the 2005 rain
 saamaanya ho chuke hai
 It has not rained like this year of 2005, but the rain this time is telling that you and we change our mind about Mumbai's rain
 is saal 20 din main jo ausat barish hoti he wo sirf do din ke bheetar ho gai
 On 10 June 2015, there was heavy rainfall in Mumbai
 2005 ke baad sabase adhik barish 10 june 2015 ko hui thi
 That record was broken this time
 4 dinon ke bheetar mumbai main 795 millimetre barish hui he
 On 30 August 2017, Mumbai received 200 mm of rain in 7 hours
 us saal varli ilaake main 12 ghante ke bheetar 330 millimetre barish ho gai thi
 In 2018 also there was such rain
 ye record bataa rahe hai ki ab ham mumbai kii barish ke apane puraane anubhavon par bharosa nahin kar sakate hai
 Drinking water may accumulate on the paths we consider safe
 shaayad yahi vajah hogi ki esayuvi gaadi main do log pani jamaa hone ke baad bhi aage badhate rahe or ant main gaadi main hi dub gaye, unki maut ho gai
 The death of two people is telling that trust in Mumbai's experience of centuries and decades regarding rain should be abandoned now
 purana anubhav ab kaam nahin aaenge
 Mumbai's rain can be deceiving at any time
 mumbai main samandar ke alaava nadiyon or daldali zamin kaa apana ek system bana hua tha
 We slowly went on to occupy them
 ye prakritik system mahanagar kii suraksha ke upkaran the
 Look around you prakritik aapadaaon kaa scale bada hota ja rahaa he
 BMC preparations may reduce the impact of the catastrophe but may not avert the catastrophe
 jin logon kii banaai nitiyon ke ye parinaam hai un par biemasi kaa jor nahin chalegaa
 Now see
 yahaan se bhashaa badalegi
 Note that language carefully
 jab aap puuchhenge ki is tabaahi kaa zimmedaar koun he, kaise is tabaahi se bachein to jawaab aayega ham sabko milakar samuhik rup se jimmedaari uthaani hogi
 Whenever the level of negligence exceeds the limit, the negligence begins to be described as collective and they are rescued by those who sit in the chair

 Common people become responsible
 kya aam log real estate ke samrajya se lard sakate hai, unki kisase santhganth hai un tak kabhi pahunch nahin paaenge
 The common people are drowning in the flood between the paths filled with buildings
 dashakon tak mumbai main real estate waalon ko puri chhot mili
 These leaders became so powerful that they became the same and politics started running on their own
 mumbai kii har prakritik zamin bhar di gai he
 The faces of those who were behind the construction of mohallas by filling the path of Bhoisar, Oshiwara, Dahisar and Mithi river, are no longer in front of us
 wo apane faislon se karodon banaakar pidiyon kaa intazaam kar gaye lekin shahar ne jo apana intazaam sadiyon se kiya tha, use barbaad kar gaye
 Now to save these people, the media's sense of collective responsibility will enter the tongue
 har koi kahegaa ki sabko milakar kuch karnaa hoga
 When the ruin was being done, some people were making crores together, when ruined, the responsibility of saving will also be given to those who are Victims, who are victims
 aabaadi kii samasya ko dosha diya jayega
 Today, who flies on the runway that is on the part of the Mithi River
 lekin mithi nadi ke bhar jane se baadh aati he usamen koun marataa he
 If you are not sure, then listen to the statement of Sanjay Raut ji
 jin chand logon kii nitiyon kii vajah se nadiyaan suukh gayi vahi ab saare bharat ko paath padhaayenge ki milakar hal nikaalnaa hoga
 Awareness has to be brought
 jab nadiyon ke ret luute ja rahe the, unki pani main audyogic kachare chode ja rahe the tab aam logon se inhen rokane kii apil nahin kii gai
 Nobody was talking about awareness then
 prakritik aapadaaon main sabase zyada garib marate hai
 But climate change has started reaching the rich people as well
 2015 main chennai shahar main baadh ai thi
 The city was so flooded that buildings up to the first floor were submerged
 343 log maare gaye the
 There is a drought in that Chennai
 vahaan is baar pani nahin he
 This morning Amitabh was reading Ghosh's book
 The great derangement sanyog se mumbai vaale chapter par pahunch gaya
 Amitabh Ghosh is a very big writer
 unki kitaab anudit hokar opium sagar jo raajakmal se chhapi he use pard lijie jivan tar ho jayega
 The Great Derangement Penguin has been published and is a 399 rupee book
 ise avashya padhein
 However, i want to mention about the chapter on Mumbai in The Great Derangement
 apane hindi ke darshakon ke liye
 In this book, Amitabh Ghosh is raising many questions about climate change
 unka kahana he ki ham abhi bhi maan kar chal rahe hai ki kuch nahin hoga, yahaan nahin hoga, vahaan nahin hoga
 The basis of this is our decades or centuries of experience, so when something suddenly becomes big, catastrophic, we say that we did not understand how it happened
 magar aap ab duniya bhar main jalwaayu parivartan ke kaaran ho rahi in tabaahiyon ko dekhie
 Look at India itself, you will know that even if you have not prepared to understand, nature has fallen behind you
 amitabh ghosh mumbai ko lekar baadh or cyclone kii ashanka ke bare main likh rahe hai
 You wonder where the cyclone in Mumbai came from
 darasal isi sawaal ko lekar amitabh ghosh ne ek amareeki professor ko likhaa tha
 It is known that during the colonial era, when the Portuguese and the British had secret, Cyclone came to Mumbai many times
 aaj ke mumbaikaron ko bhale na lage ki yahaan neuyark kii tarah hurricane sandy jaisaa chakravaat aa saktaa he magar mumbai main chakravaat aate rahe hai
 In 1783, there was such a tremendous cyclone that 400 people died
 19veen sadi or beesvi sadin ke shuru main chakravaati tufaan ke ricard milte hai
 In 2009, there was a cyclone in Mumbai, but at that time the wind speed was 85 kilometers per hour, which was very slow
 neuyark ke harricane sandy kii raftaar 185 kilometre prati ghante thi
 At that time, Mayor Bloomberg of New York did a great job, even then 285 people were killed
 yahi nahin di great dirrangement padhate hue jaankaree mili ki in dinon arab sagar ke taton par chakravaati tufaan kii sankhya badhane lagi he jo aane vaale samay main or badhegi
 Similarly, the number of cyclonic storms in the Bay of Bengal will start to decrease
 amitabh ne likhaa he ki agar mumbai main chakravaat aayaa to phir uskaa getwe of india vaala sira tabah ho jayega jahaan amir aabaadi rahati he
 Which does not make any difference due to the cutting of the mangrove forest and the erosion of the sweet river
 mumbai kii oonchi imaaraton main jo shishe lage hai wo ukhd kar jaanaleva ban jaaenge
 Overall, Mumbai does not appear to be ready for more than 1000 millimeters of rain nor for cyclones
 kyonki mumbai main pehle jab bhi chakravaat aayaa he tab uski aabaadi das lakh se kam thi
 Today it was more than two crores
 tabaahi kaa andaaza laga sakate hai agar nahin to behatar he ki aap whatsap karte rahen, gurmarning messej main hi dhyaan lagaaiye
 nothing will happen
 aapkaa jo hona tha wo ab ho chukaa he
 It has been four years since the Chennai floods
 madas hoicourt ne kaha tha ki adayar or ksham nadi ke kinare se atikaraman hataaya jaae
 It can also be checked
 ham kuch karne kii baat kar na karne ke maamle main gazab ke log hai
 If, given the coverage of Mumbai, one feels that it will not be in his city, then he should remember the flood of Kerala
 agast 2018 main gurugram kii wo baadh yaad kar leni chahie
 On August 29, there was 121 mm of rain within five hours
 aath saal tak aisi barish nahin hui magar us din ho gai
 People were stuck in the jam for hours
 hero honda chowk ke paas 20 feet gaharaa pani jamaa ho gaya tha
 The people of Gurugram continued to tweet the Millennium Millennium but climate change had already warned them
 daawey ke saath nahin kah sakate ki ab jab aisi barish hogi to gurugram main vaisaa sab kuch nahin hoga
 Come to the question of climate change
 is par sainkadon research hai
 All the experts are coming and giving warning which is also happening
 isliye jaagrukta kii kami nahin he
 If Aditya Thackeray is talking about climate change, then listen, but ask him also, the idea of climate change has come this year
 pehle kyon nahin aayaa
 Now when he has come, what are he going to do? kya ve 54000 mangrove ke pedo ko bullate train ke liye katane se roak lenge
 Except for some time, the Shiv Sena has been ruling the BMC since 1985 till date
 isliye biensi uski javabdehi to banati he
 Mumbai only comes to save
 tabaahi ke samay shahar kaa pradarshan shandaar hota he
 One by one employees are employed
 bachaav kaary main lage hero ko pahachaanie magar us villen ko bhi khojie jo in sabake liye dashakon se zimmedaar rahaa he
 Meanwhile, a tweet by Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut was seen
 unki kavita dekhakar main bhavuk ho gaya
 You get to read such poems on trucks, on the walls of line hotels, in the bus stand
 shairchat or whats ap or tik tok main aisi kavitaaon or shaayari kii bharmaar he
 As is the level of water, so is the level of poetry
 pehle ham jalwaayu parivartan ko thik kar len baad main shaayari kii samasya dekh lenge
 So is the poem by Sanjay Raut ji
 
 
 jab pradhanmantri ne gaalib kaa sher kot kiya tab aalochakon ne kaha ki aisa gaalib ne to nahin kaha, zarur whatsap jagat se aayaa hoga
 So influenced by that, we searched the internet to find out the poetry of Sanjay Raut ji
 haalanki unhone apane twit main daawa nahin kiya he ki unhone likhi he
 Nevertheless we checked where this poem came from
 sad shaayari dot kaam ke lav shaayari section main isi tarah kii ek kavita mili he
 This poem has been found in the section Rani Shayari of Harmony Shayari
com
 sanjay raut ne pehle se is kavita main sirf barish jod kar twit kar diya he
 Are our mps spending more time on Harmony Shayari and Love Shayari
com than Mumbai
 veri sad and veri phani
 You will find this poem very well on the Internet
 hamen afsos he ki jis tarah se ham mumbai kii tabaahi ke liye zimmedaar ko khoj nahin paae, usee tarah premiyon ke bich popular is kavita ke rachayita ko bhi khoj nahin sake
 Then said that i get emotional with poetry
 kahaan kahaan bhatak gaya
 i want to give the book of Habib Zalib to Sanjay Raut ji
 gaalib kii bhi duungaa taaki koi gaalib or jaalib main kanfus na karen
 So you should not be confused about BMC accountability and climate change
 jalwaayu parivartan ke kaaran sirf mumbai main nahin hai
 Also in Delhi politics
 un nitiyon main bhi he jinaki ham vaahvahee karte rahete hai
 There have been 5 major natural disasters in India in the last 11 months
 sabakaa ek hi kaaran he jalwaayu parivartan
 It has affected millions of people
 kerala kii baadh
 Drought in Chennai, cyclone phony of Odisha, severe heat across India
 mumbai kii barish
 We have forgotten that the temperature in May and June was skyrocketing
 churu main 50 degree celsium taapmaana chalaa gaya to dilli main adhiktam taapmaana ke record tuutane lage
 How many people died in Bihar due to heat stroke
 isaki aadhakarik sankhya to nahin he magar media ne lu se marane waalon kii sankhya kahin 185 likhi he to kahin 150
 There was no rain in Chennai for 198 days
 yah bhi record he
 The highest rainfall in Mumbai in ten years is also a record
 agar aapkaa kaam ricard se chalata he to likh len, rat len magar prakritik aapadaa aapaki taiyaariyon kaa imtahaan lene aa rahi he or aapaki laaparvaahee kii sazaa dene bhi
 The answer to the question of climate change is not, or will not be, with BMC or MCD
 unke paas he jinhen ham raajnneetik javabdehi saunpte hai
 At the moment the meaning policy that our politics has, within thirty forty years our hundreds of rivers disappeared
 naale main badal gayi
 a building was built there
 ranve ban gaye
 Politics will tell you that this problem has to be solved jointly
 ab tak aap raajnneetik vikalp kaa matlab dal yaa netaa se samaj rahe the
 Instead, start talking about economic options
 jo nitiyaan chal rahi hai jinamein ham apane sapane dekhte hai unamem sirf tabaahi ke nae nae record hai
 The report sent by our colleagues from Mumbai is in front of you
 yaad rakhie lav shaayari se jalwaayu parivartan kii samasya kaa hal nahin hoga

 In this program, Somvanshi said that the noise of words makes poems
 saath hi chaaron kaviyon ne apni kavitaayen or rachana darshakon ke saamne prastut kii
 Carrying the discussion further, Somvanshi while narrating the lion on the mobile said that if someone is disturbed again today, then understand that his mobile was lost

 He further said that i am listening to you completely, why my voice does not go away, where is this problem like from the phone network? pratap somvanshi ne aise hi kai sher shrotaaon ke saath saajha kiye
 How will the birth proverb Sanjay Kundan said that words are related to the origin of human beings, first they used to write on leaves, then on paper and now on mobile
 unhone kahawaton ke janm par kavita sunaate hue kaha ki kitna hasod rahaa hoga wo aadmi jisane ek oont ke saath majaak kiya hoga, uske munh main jire ke ek dana rakhkar
 
 
 It must have been a big puck that the person who thought of selling jasmine oil on the head of the mole photo- ke asifasanjay kundan ne kaha ki kahawaton ke janm ke bare main socho, kisne kaha hoga pehali baar adhjal gagari jhalkat jaae
 
 
 They were our ancestors who neither had to become famous nor become poets
 yahi vajah he ki rahi ki unhone kahawaton main apana naam nahin joda, ve jindagi ke katu aalochak rahe honge
 There must have been an enthusiastic seafarer among them who concluded that he was searching for three pies
 
 
 un anaam purvajon ne darana to siikhaa nahin hoga kyonki maut ko saamne se ranga siyaar kahkar wo chidhaate honge
 Today it is round to clever poets and sponsored words, i wish i could say an accurate saying about this period

 He recited his poem 'in the last one hour'
 iske bol the,pichley ek ghante main
 
 
 At present, the population on earth is more than 7 billion, like every hour, many crores of people will use the word love, just like every other day, the average meaning of crores of words used this hour, that means that The history of the hour will be considered recorded and true, but the context and context of everyone is not necessarily the same, which will be extracted from the average of the hour
 aage kavita padhate hue nidhish ne kaha
 
 
 In the name of love, someone will be on a slipping band, someone will be blazing, some may be cropping, there will be a giver, some may be telling lies, some may be living with suspicion, some are ashes on change, some are searching There will be something like love, someone is going through relationships, someone is googleing the ways of suicide, some is going through simmering, some will be jumping and running, to look in the eyes
 
 
 pyaar kaa ausat pyaar nahin ho paaegaa
 Cheated and took a vote
 
 
 kavi alok yadav ne apane ghazal sunai, meri dil kii koun kahegaa chodo bhi, diwane kii koun sunegaa chodo bhi
 
 
 Whose lie you go to sacrifice, what will he tell you the truth? 
 
 girggit rang badalane main maahir he par insaanon se jeet sakegaa chodo bhi
 
 
 You listened to him and agreed, now he will listen to you also
 
 
 sach sunne kii jid chodo rahane bhi do, tumko ek-ek lafj chubhega chodo bhi
 
 dhokhaa dekar vot liya or jeet gaya, ab wo tumhaara kaam karegaa chodo bhi
 
 tumne dur chalaa to jaaun main lekin koun tumhaara dhyaan rakhega chodo bhi
 Poet Nidhish Tyagi recited so much of his poetry as well
 phir sanjay ne apni kavita aadminama sunaakar shrotaaon kaa dil jeet liya

 a post shared by Nirahua (@dineslalyadav) on Dec 3, 2018 at 12:53 am PST bharat ke videsh mantri pranab mukherjee ne kaha he ki ham har tarah ke aatankwaad ke khilaaf hai or saath hi littey se bharat ko koi sahanubhuti nahin he
 Significantly, in the last round of war between the army and LTTE militants in Sri Lanka, Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee is going to visit Lanka for two days from today
 is dauraan videsh mantri lanka ke raashtrapati mahinda rajpakshe or videsh mantri rohita bogolgama se milenge or maujuuda halaat par charchaa karenge
 During this visit, External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee will also pressurize the Lankan leaders to give equal rights to the Tamils living there
 vaise mana ja rahaa he ki srilankai tamilon ke hakon ke liye lard rahe altitii par faujee hamale ke baad se karunanidhi samet tamaam bhartiya tamil netaa lagaataar centre par dabaav banaae hue the, ki srilankai sarkaar ko faujee karrwai kii bajaay raajnneetik samaadhaan ke liye kaha jaae
 Meanwhile, the big news is that the Sri Lankan army has also captured the last LTTE stronghold, Malaitivu, although sporadic fighting is still going on, but the LTTE militants are forced to flee into the jungles
 inamen altitii pramukh prabhakaran kii bhi charchaa he, jiskaa naam purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi hatyakand kii chargeshit main pramukh aropiyon main shaamil he
 The official mascot 'stumpy' of the ICC Cricket World Cup-2011 has been brought to the world
 'stampi' kaaphi had tak 1982 asian khelon ke shubhankar 'appu' jaisaa hi he, lekin dekhne kii baat yah hogi ki stampi ko appu jaisi lokapriyata mil paati he yaa nahin
 Appu had climbed the tongue of the countrymen
 uske naam par dilli main pragati maidan parisar main appu-ghar kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha, jahaan bachche apane mata-pita ke saath aakar mouj-masti kiya karte the
 Appu Ghar is no longer there
 use ucchtam nyaayalay ke vakeelon ke cabin banane ke liye todaa ja chukaa he
 Appu has also died, but till now the countrymen have neither forgotten Appu nor appu-ghar
 stampi ke saamne appu jaisaa lokapriy banane kii chunauti he
 This mascot may gain popularity in the thunderstorm of cricket's popularity, but given the speed at which cricket matches are being played, Stumpy may be lost in the books after a few years
 aisa ho saktaa he ki use cricket ke jununee bhartiya logon ke dilon par raaj karne kaa mauka na mil sake
