 This story is not just of Uttar Pradesh, there will be a story in every state where employees are thrown out after working in different departments of the government for many years
 10 saal, 20 saal sarkaar ke yahaan naukari karne ke baad baahar phenk die gaye ye log sachivalayon or ziladhikari karyaalay ke baahar dharna dete hue nazar aate hai
 It is not that they do not win from the courts, they are not appointed even after winning, and if they are defeated, their trial is stopped forever by making excuses for the decision of the court
 sarkaar kii niti or adaalat ke faisle kii sakht samiksha kii zarurat he taaki ek paimaana ban sake ki kisi se das bees saal kii seva lekar use niyamon or maapdandon kaa bahaanaa banaakar itani aasaani se chalata nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Today we are going to talk about education friends of Uttar Pradesh
 aisa nahin he ki media ne inaki baat nahin kii, sthaneey akhbaar shikshamitron ke andolan or pradarshnon se bhare pade hai
 News channels also showed but some solution to their problem is not known
 jabaki yah maamla sau do sau kaa nahin ek lakh 70,000 se adhik shiksha mitron kaa he
 In terms of numbers, think how big a matter it is, but no one knows what the solution will be
 lakhanu main 49 dinon se shiksha mitra dharne par baithe hai
 It has been difficult to calculate how much has been staged in the last one year
 inaki kahani is tarah se he ki 2002 se 2009 tak 1 lakh 78 hazaar shiksha mitra niyukt kiye jate hai
 To teach first and second grade children
 us vakt prashikshit shikshak nahin the to unki jagah inhen niyukt kiya gaya, kyonki desh main sakshartaa dar bahut kam thi
 The salary of these Shiksha Mitras was Rs 1850 in 2002, which reached 3500 before becoming regular in 2014
 itane kam paise par inhone 12 saal skulon main padhaayaa
 On 11 July 2011, the order of the UP government comes out that all these will be offered a BTC course through distance education from a government institution
 jab inaki niyukti hui thi tab bahut se inter paas the
 But most of them have obtained BA degree and BTC certificate too
 1 agast 2014 se inhen kareeb 40,000 vetan miltaa he
 The matter goes to the High Court from where their regularization gets canceled
 supreme court jate hai vahaan lambii sunwaayee ke baad 25 july 2017 ko cese haar jate hai
 The government says that they will solve their problem, but a year has passed
 is vakt ek lakh sattar hazaar se adhik shiksha mitra sadak par hai
 His job was regularized, which is no more
 selary 40,000 mil rahi thi, jo ab 10,000 hi mil rahi he
 No one knows what will solve their problem
 kab nikalegaa iskaa to or bhi pataa nahin
 While he was teaching at the salary of 3500 for 12 years, no one felt that they are useless, they should be discarded
 zyaadaatar saadhaaran gharon ke ladke hai
 It is published in the newspapers of UP that Shikamitra died due to shock, died of depression, someone committed suicide and someone became a victim of depression
 2 june ko hapur ke ek shiksha mitra mahesh kumaar kii zindagi samaapt ho gai
 Before dying, he had asked the president of the district organization when his honorarium would come
 hapur main shiksha mitron ko march se 10,000 bhi nahin mil rahaa tha
 This young man was battling cancer and had no money for medicine
 isaki kahani bataate hue iske saathi ro pade
 Whose salary is Rs 10,000 and if he does not get any for three months, then imagine what his condition would have been
 upi main aisa koi nahin jo shiksha mitron kii samasya se waakif na ho
 Many mps and mlas have written letters to address their problem
 2017 ke vidhaan sabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ke sankalp patr main likhaa he ki pradesh ke sabhi shiksha mitron kii rojgaar samasya ko 3 maheenon me nyyochit tareekon se suljhaayaa jayega
 By then the High Court had quashed the decision to make them regular
 sarkaar banane ke baad supreme court kaa faisla aata he usamen bhi inaki naukari nirast ho jaati he
 On 18 September 2015, Prime Minister Modi, the leader of the Banaras MP, has twice mentioned Shiksha Mitras in his speeches
 aap suniye or dekhie ki vaada karke baad bhi aakhir is samasya kaa samaadhaan kyon nahin niklaa
 Shiksha Mitra has been in Lucknow for 49 days
 pradhanmantri hi bataa sakate hai ki ve is shiksha mitron ke saath hai yaa nahin, apni yogi sarkaar se inaki samasya ke samaadhaan par baat kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 The issue of jobs, salary and life of one lakh seventy thousand people cannot be left to Ram's faith or any committee's trust
 mukhyamantri yogi ne bhi apane chunavi bhaashanon main shiksha mitron ke liye kuch kadam uthaane kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 What will be the meaning of the words of Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Yogi if their problem is not resolved
 unhen bataanaa chahie
 They are currently getting 10,000, which is less than the minimum wage
 kam se kam yahi ninsaphi pradhanmantri ji subah phone kar upi sarkaar se dur karvaa den
 The Prime Minister gives great importance to Teacher's Day, so how can they afford that up's education friends are getting less than minimum wages and less than other states
 haryana main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 21,714 rupee miltaa he
 Punjab gets 12 months salary and 19,400 a month
 maharashtra main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 35,000 miltaa he
 Now come to some part of the decision of the Supreme Court
 hamane shabdash anuwaad to nahin kiya he, hindi main faisle to likhe nahin jate magar kisi tarah aakhri pare kaa saar pesh kar rahaa hum
 The Supreme Court has written in its order that Shiksha Mitras do not fall under the minimum eligibility set for the appointment of teachers after the notification date of 23 August 2010, due to which they cannot be regularized
 is nunatam paatrata ke bagair koi niyukti nahin ho sakati he or is cese main niyukti 2010 ke baad hui he
 The appointment of Shiksha Mitras was not only on contract but also according to the eligibility to become a teacher or the honorarium paid to the teacher
 isliye inhen shikshak ke rup main niyamit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The exceptions given by the Supreme Court are not applicable in the context of the present case
 hamaara maananaa he ki shiksha mitra kabhi bhi shikshak ke rup main niyukt nahin hue the or na hi ye sarv shiksha abhiyaan kanoon kii dhara 23(2) ke tahat mili chhot ke daayre main aate hai
 Therefore also they cannot be appointed
 rajya sarkaar ko apni taraf se chhot dene kaa adhikaar hasil nahin he
 The comments ek taraf hamaare saamne niyamon kaa ulanghan kar 1 lakh 78 hazaar logon ko niyamit kiye jane kaa daawa he to duusari taraf hamaara daayitv he ki ham kanoon ke raaj ko kaayam rakhen
 We also have to respect that under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, children between 6 and 14 years should get education from properly trained teachers
 adaalat ke faisle ko samajhane ke liye hamane samvidhan visheshgy faizan mustafaa sahab kii madad lene ja rahe hai unase samajhenge ki is faisle main kya guzaaish hai, kya visangityaan hai
 After this decision, is there any way left to the officials and ministers of UP government or not
 kya shiksha mitron ke paas koi kanoonee rasta bachaa he jisase ve apni 40,000 kii selary waapas le sakate hai or regular ho sakate hai
 After fulfilling the government's goal for 14 years, can anyone be thrown such, the honorarium of 10,000 is also a temporary arrangement, how long will their life last on this money
 supreme court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki agar stop gap yani asthaayee taur par kisi ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa jaae to bhi ant main qualiphoid teacher kii hi niyukti hogi
 The court has used the term stop gap, but you think these people continued to teach from 2002 to 2014
 kya adaalat 12 saal kii seva ko stop gap maanati he, kya us 12 saal kii seva ke badale muawza nahin milanaa chahie tha
 There is a need for strict review of the government's policy and the decision of the court so that a measure can be made that it cannot be carried so easily by taking ten to twenty years of service and pretending to rules and norms
 ham aaj uttar pradesh ke shiksha mitron kii baat karne ja rahe hai
 It is not that the media did not talk about them; local newspapers are full of agitations and demonstrations by Shikshamitras
 news channelon ne bhi dikhaaya magar inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan kaa kuch ata pataa nahin he
 Whereas this matter is not one hundred two hundred and not one lakh 70,000 education friends
 sankhya ke lihaaz se bhi sochie ki yah kitna bada maamla he, magar iskaa samaadhaan kya hoga kisi ko pataa nahin
 Shiksha Mitras have been sitting on a dharna in Lucknow for 49 days
 pichley ek saal main kitna dharna de chuke hai, hisaab karnaa mushkil he
 His story is such that from 2002 to 2009, one lakh 78 thousand Shiksha Mitras are appointed
 pehali or duusari kaksha ke bacchon ko padhaane ke liye
 There were no trained teachers at that time, so they were appointed instead, because the literacy rate in the country was very low
 in shiksha mitron kii selary 2002 main 1850 rupye thi jo 2014 main regular hone se pehle 3500 par pahunchi thi
 He taught 12 years in schools for so little money
 11 july 2011 ko upi sarkaar kaa aadesh nikalataa he ki in sabhi ko sarkari santhaan se duurastha shiksha ke zarie beatisi kaa course karaayaa jayega
 When he was appointed, there were many inter passes
 magar zyaadaatar ne bie kii degree hasil kar lee or beatisi kaa bhi certificate mil chukaa tha
 From 1 August 2014, they get around 40,000 salaries
 maamla hoicourt main jaataa he jahaan se inkaa regular hona radd ho jaataa he
 He goes to the Supreme Court after a long hearing and loses the case on 25 July 2017
 sarkaar kahati he ki inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan nikaalenge magar ek saal biit gaya
 At present, more than one hundred seventy thousand education friends are on the road
 unki naukari regular hui thi jo ab nahin he
 Salary was getting 40,000, which is now 10,000 only
 inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan kya nikalegaa kisi ko pataa nahin he
 i do not even know when it will come out
 jab tak ye 12 saal tak 3500 kii selary par padhaa rahe the tab kisi ko nahin laga ki ye bekaar hai ayogy hai, inhen nikaal dena chahie
 Most are ordinary boys
 aae din upi ke akhabaaron main chhapata rahata he ki sadame se shikshamitra kii maut ho gai, avsaad se maut ho gai, kisi ne aatmahatya kar lee to koi avsaad kaa shikaar ho gaya
 On 2 June, Mahesh Kumar, an education friend of Hapur, ended his life
 marane se pehle unhone zile ke sanghathan ke adhyaksh se poocha tha ki unka maandey kab aayega
 Education friends were not getting 10,000 since March in Hapur
 ye noujvaan cancer se jujh rahaa tha or dawa ke paise nahin the
 Its companions wept while telling its story
 jisaki tankhwaah 10,000 rupee ho or wo bhi teen maheene se kisi ko na mili to sochie uski haalat kya ho gai hogi
 There is no one in UP who is not aware of the problem of education friends
 kai saansadon or vidhayakon ne inaki samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye patr likhe hai
 In the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections, the bjp's resolution letter states that the employment problem of all Shiksha Mitras of the state will be resolved in 3 months in a fair manner
 tab tak hoicourt ne inke regular kiye jane ke faisle ko nirast kar chukaa tha
 After the formation of the government, the decision of the Supreme Court comes, their job is canceled in that too
 18 sitambar 2015 ko banaras ke saansad ke netaa pradhanmantri modi ne do baar apane bhaashanon main shiksha mitron kaa zikr kiya he
 Listen and see why the promise was not resolved even after making a promise
 lakhanu main shiksha mitra 49 dinon se dharnarat hai
 Only the Prime Minister can tell whether he is with this education friends or not, whether he is talking to his yogi government on the solution of his problem
 ek lakh sattar hazaar logon kii naukari, selary or zindagi kaa masalaa ram bharose yaa kisi cameti bharose nahin choda ja saktaa he
 In his election speeches, Chief Minister Yogi also promised to take some steps for Shiksha Mitras
 pradhanmantri modi or mukhyamantri yogi kii jubaan kaa kya matlab rah jayega agar inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin nikalataa he
 They should tell
 is vakt inhen 10,000 mil rahaa he jo nunatam mazaduri se kam he
 At least this injustice is done by calling the Prime Minister in the morning to get him away from the UP government
 pradhanmantri shikshak diwas ko kaaphi mahatv dete hai to phir ve kaise bardaasht kar sakate hai ki upi ke shiksha mitron ko nunatam mazdooree se kam or duusare rajyon se bhi kam selary mil rahi he
 Haryana gets 12 months salary and Rs 21,714 a month
 punjab main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 19,400 miltaa he
 Maharashtra gets 12 months salary and 35,000 a month
 ab aate hai supreme court ke faisle ke kuch hisse par
 We have not translated verbatim, decisions are not written in Hindi, but somehow i am presenting the essence of last steps
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main likhaa he ki 23 agast 2010 ke notification kii taarikh ke baad shikshakon kii niyukti ke liye jo nunatam paatrata tay kii gai he uske tahat shiksha mitra nahin aate hai, jiske kaaran unhen regular nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 No appointment can be made without this minimum eligibility and in this case the appointment is made after 2010
 shiksha mitron kii niyukti na sirf theke par hui thi balki shikshak banane kii paatrata yaa shikshak ko milane vaale maandey ke hisaab se bhi nahin hui thi
 Therefore they cannot be regularized as teachers
 supreme court ne jo apwaad swaroop faisle die hai wo maujuuda cese ke sandarbh main lagu nahin hote hai
 We believe that Shiksha Mitra was never appointed as a teacher nor does it come under the exemption granted under Section 23 (2) of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Act
 isliye bhi inaki niyukti nahin ho sakati he
 The state government does not have the right to grant exemption on its behalf
 tippaniyan On the one hand, we claim to have regularized 1 lakh 78 thousand people in violation of rules, on the other hand we have an obligation to uphold the rule of law
 hamen is baat kaa bhi sammaan rakhana he ki sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat 6 se 14 saal ke bacchon ko uchit tareeke se prashikshit shikshakon se shiksha mili
 To understand the decision of the court, we are going to take the help of Faizan Mustafa Saheb, the constitution expert, to understand from him what are the chances and inconsistencies in this decision
 kya is faisle ke baad upi sarkaar ke adhikariyon or mantriyon ke paas koi rasta bachataa he yaa nahin bachataa he
 Is there any legal way left to Shiksha Mitras to withdraw his salary of 40,000 and become regular
 14 saal tak sarkaar ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke baad kya kisi ko aisa phenkaa ja saktaa he, 10,000 kaa maandey bhi asthaayee vyavastha he is paise par inkaa jivan kab tak chalegaa
 The Supreme Court has written in its judgment that even if the stop gap is temporarily kept for teaching someone, only qualified teacher will be appointed in the end
 adaalat ne stop gap shabd kaa istamaal kiya he, par aap sochie 2002 se 2014 tak ye log padhaate rahe
 Should the court consider 12 years of service as a stop gap, should there not have been compensation for that 12 years of service
 lakhanu main 49 dinon se shiksha mitra dharne par baithe hai
 It has been difficult to calculate how much has been staged in the last one year
 inaki kahani is tarah se he ki 2002 se 2009 tak 1 lakh 78 hazaar shiksha mitra niyukt kiye jate hai

 aap suniye or dekhie ki vaada karke baad bhi aakhir is samasya kaa samaadhaan kyon nahin niklaa
 Shiksha Mitra has been in Lucknow for 49 days
 pradhanmantri hi bataa sakate hai ki ve is shiksha mitron ke saath hai yaa nahin, apni yogi sarkaar se inaki samasya ke samaadhaan par baat kar rahe hai yaa nahin
 The issue of jobs, salary and life of one lakh seventy thousand people cannot be left to Ram's faith or any committee's trust
 mukhyamantri yogi ne bhi apane chunavi bhaashanon main shiksha mitron ke liye kuch kadam uthaane kaa aashwaasan diya tha
 What will be the meaning of the words of Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Yogi if their problem is not resolved
 unhen bataanaa chahie
 They are currently getting 10,000, which is less than the minimum wage
 kam se kam yahi ninsaphi pradhanmantri ji subah phone kar upi sarkaar se dur karvaa den
 The Prime Minister gives great importance to Teacher's Day, so how can they afford that up's education friends are getting less than minimum wages and less than other states
 haryana main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 21,714 rupee miltaa he
 Punjab gets 12 months salary and 19,400 a month
 maharashtra main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 35,000 miltaa he
 Now come to some part of the decision of the Supreme Court
 hamane shabdash anuwaad to nahin kiya he, hindi main faisle to likhe nahin jate magar kisi tarah aakhri pare kaa saar pesh kar rahaa hum
 The Supreme Court has written in its order that Shiksha Mitras do not fall under the minimum eligibility set for the appointment of teachers after the notification date of 23 August 2010, due to which they cannot be regularized
 is nunatam paatrata ke bagair koi niyukti nahin ho sakati he or is cese main niyukti 2010 ke baad hui he
 The appointment of Shiksha Mitras was not only on contract but also according to the eligibility to become a teacher or the honorarium paid to the teacher
 isliye inhen shikshak ke rup main niyamit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The exceptions given by the Supreme Court are not applicable in the context of the present case
 hamaara maananaa he ki shiksha mitra kabhi bhi shikshak ke rup main niyukt nahin hue the or na hi ye sarv shiksha abhiyaan kanoon kii dhara 23(2) ke tahat mili chhot ke daayre main aate hai
 Therefore also they cannot be appointed
 rajya sarkaar ko apni taraf se chhot dene kaa adhikaar hasil nahin he
 The comments ek taraf hamaare saamne niyamon kaa ulanghan kar 1 lakh 78 hazaar logon ko niyamit kiye jane kaa daawa he to duusari taraf hamaara daayitv he ki ham kanoon ke raaj ko kaayam rakhen
 We also have to respect that under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, children between 6 and 14 years should get education from properly trained teachers
 adaalat ke faisle ko samajhane ke liye hamane samvidhan visheshgy faizan mustafaa sahab kii madad lene ja rahe hai unase samajhenge ki is faisle main kya guzaaish hai, kya visangityaan hai
 After this decision, is there any way left to the officials and ministers of UP government or not
 kya shiksha mitron ke paas koi kanoonee rasta bachaa he jisase ve apni 40,000 kii selary waapas le sakate hai or regular ho sakate hai
 After fulfilling the government's goal for 14 years, can anyone be thrown such, the honorarium of 10,000 is also a temporary arrangement, how long will their life last on this money
 supreme court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki agar stop gap yani asthaayee taur par kisi ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa jaae to bhi ant main qualiphoid teacher kii hi niyukti hogi
 The court has used the term stop gap, but you think these people continued to teach from 2002 to 2014
 kya adaalat 12 saal kii seva ko stop gap maanati he, kya us 12 saal kii seva ke badale muawza nahin milanaa chahie tha
 At present, more than one hundred seventy thousand education friends are on the road
 unki naukari regular hui thi jo ab nahin he
 Salary was getting 40,000, which is now 10,000 only
 inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan kya nikalegaa kisi ko pataa nahin he
 i do not even know when it will come out
 jab tak ye 12 saal tak 3500 kii selary par padhaa rahe the tab kisi ko nahin laga ki ye bekaar hai ayogy hai, inhen nikaal dena chahie
 Most are ordinary boys
 aae din upi ke akhabaaron main chhapata rahata he ki sadame se shikshamitra kii maut ho gai, avsaad se maut ho gai, kisi ne aatmahatya kar lee to koi avsaad kaa shikaar ho gaya
 On 2 June, Mahesh Kumar, an education friend of Hapur, ended his life
 marane se pehle unhone zile ke sanghathan ke adhyaksh se poocha tha ki unka maandey kab aayega
 Education friends were not getting 10,000 since March in Hapur
 ye noujvaan cancer se jujh rahaa tha or dawa ke paise nahin the
 Its companions wept while telling its story
 jisaki tankhwaah 10,000 rupee ho or wo bhi teen maheene se kisi ko na mili to sochie uski haalat kya ho gai hogi
 There is no one in UP who is not aware of the problem of education friends
 kai saansadon or vidhayakon ne inaki samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye patr likhe hai
 In the 2017 Vidhan Sabha elections, the bjp's resolution letter states that the employment problem of all Shiksha Mitras of the state will be resolved in 3 months in a fair manner
 tab tak hoicourt ne inke regular kiye jane ke faisle ko nirast kar chukaa tha
 After the formation of the government , the decision of the Supreme Court comes in that their job is canceled
 18 sitambar 2015 ko banaras ke saansad ke netaa pradhanmantri modi ne do baar apane bhaashanon main shiksha mitron kaa zikr kiya he
 Listen and see why the promise was not resolved even after making a promise
 lakhanu main shiksha mitra 49 dinon se dharnarat hai
 Only the Prime Minister can tell whether he is with this education friends or not, whether he is talking to his yogi government on the solution of his problem
 ek lakh sattar hazaar logon kii naukari, selary or zindagi kaa masalaa ram bharose yaa kisi cameti bharose nahin choda ja saktaa he
 In his election speeches, Chief Minister Yogi also promised to take some steps for Shiksha Mitras
 pradhanmantri modi or mukhyamantri yogi kii jubaan kaa kya matlab rah jayega agar inaki samasya kaa samaadhaan nahin nikalataa he
 They should tell
 is vakt inhen 10,000 mil rahaa he jo nunatam mazaduri se kam he
 At least this injustice is done by calling the Prime Minister in the morning to get him away from the UP government
 pradhanmantri shikshak diwas ko kaaphi mahatv dete hai to phir ve kaise bardaasht kar sakate hai ki upi ke shiksha mitron ko nunatam mazdooree se kam or duusare rajyon se bhi kam selary mil rahi he
 Haryana gets 12 months salary and Rs 21,714 a month
 punjab main 12 maheene vetan miltaa he or ek maheene kaa 19,400 miltaa he
 Maharashtra gets 12 months salary and 35,000 a month
 ab aate hai supreme court ke faisle ke kuch hisse par
 We have not translated verbatim, decisions are not written in Hindi, but somehow i am presenting the essence of last steps
 supreme court ne apane aadesh main likhaa he ki 23 agast 2010 ke notification kii taarikh ke baad shikshakon kii niyukti ke liye jo nunatam paatrata tay kii gai he uske tahat shiksha mitra nahin aate hai, jiske kaaran unhen regular nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 No appointment can be made without this minimum eligibility and in this case the appointment is made after 2010
 shiksha mitron kii niyukti na sirf theke par hui thi balki shikshak banane kii paatrata yaa shikshak ko milane vaale maandey ke hisaab se bhi nahin hui thi
 Therefore they cannot be regularized as teachers
 supreme court ne jo apwaad swaroop faisle die hai wo maujuuda cese ke sandarbh main lagu nahin hote hai
 We believe that Shiksha Mitra was never appointed as a teacher nor does it come under the exemption granted under Section 23 (2) of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Act
 isliye bhi inaki niyukti nahin ho sakati he
 The state government does not have the right to grant exemption on its behalf
 tippaniyan On the one hand, we claim to have regularized 1 lakh 78 thousand people in violation of rules, on the other hand we have an obligation to uphold the rule of law
 hamen is baat kaa bhi sammaan rakhana he ki sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat 6 se 14 saal ke bacchon ko uchit tareeke se prashikshit shikshakon se shiksha mili
 To understand the decision of the court, we are going to take the help of Faizan Mustafa Saheb, the constitution expert, to understand from him what are the chances and inconsistencies in this decision
 kya is faisle ke baad upi sarkaar ke adhikariyon or mantriyon ke paas koi rasta bachataa he yaa nahin bachataa he
 Is there any legal way left to Shiksha Mitras to withdraw his salary of 40,000 and become regular
 14 saal tak sarkaar ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke baad kya kisi ko aisa phenkaa ja saktaa he, 10,000 kaa maandey bhi asthaayee vyavastha he is paise par inkaa jivan kab tak chalegaa
 The Supreme Court has written in its judgment that even if the stop gap is temporarily kept for teaching someone, only qualified teacher will be appointed in the end
 adaalat ne stop gap shabd kaa istamaal kiya he, par aap sochie 2002 se 2014 tak ye log padhaate rahe
 Should the court consider 12 years of service as a stop gap, should there not have been compensation for that 12 years of service
 2 june ko hapur ke ek shiksha mitra mahesh kumaar kii zindagi samaapt ho gai
 Before dying, he had asked the president of the district organization when his honorarium would come
 hapur main shiksha mitron ko march se 10,000 bhi nahin mil rahaa tha
 This young man was battling cancer and had no money for medicine
 isaki kahani bataate hue iske saathi ro pade
 Whose salary is Rs 10,000 and if he does not get any for three months, then imagine what his condition would have been
 upi main aisa koi nahin jo shiksha mitron kii samasya se waakif na ho
 Many mps and mlas have written letters to address their problem
 2017 ke vidhaan sabha chunaavon main bhaajapa ke sankalp patr main likhaa he ki pradesh ke sabhi shiksha mitron kii rojgaar samasya ko 3 maheenon me nyyochit tareekon se suljhaayaa jayega
 By then the High Court had quashed the decision to make them regular
 sarkaar banane ke baad supreme court kaa faisla aata he usamen bhi inaki naukari nirast ho jaati he
 On 18 September 2015, Prime Minister Modi, the leader of the Banaras MP, has twice mentioned Shiksha Mitras in his speeches

 supreme court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki agar stop gap yani asthaayee taur par kisi ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa jaae to bhi ant main qualiphoid teacher kii hi niyukti hogi
 The court has used the term stop gap, but you think these people continued to teach from 2002 to 2014
 kya adaalat 12 saal kii seva ko stop gap maanati he, kya us 12 saal kii seva ke badale muawza nahin milanaa chahie tha
 Now come to some part of the decision of the Supreme Court
 hamane shabdash anuwaad to nahin kiya he, hindi main faisle to likhe nahin jate magar kisi tarah aakhri pare kaa saar pesh kar rahaa hum
 The Supreme Court has written in its order that Shiksha Mitras do not fall under the minimum eligibility set for the appointment of teachers after the notification date of 23 August 2010, due to which they cannot be regularized
 is nunatam paatrata ke bagair koi niyukti nahin ho sakati he or is cese main niyukti 2010 ke baad hui he
 The appointment of Shiksha Mitras was not only on contract but also according to the eligibility to become a teacher or the honorarium paid to the teacher
 isliye inhen shikshak ke rup main niyamit nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The exceptions given by the Supreme Court are not applicable in the context of the present case
 hamaara maananaa he ki shiksha mitra kabhi bhi shikshak ke rup main niyukt nahin hue the or na hi ye sarv shiksha abhiyaan kanoon kii dhara 23(2) ke tahat mili chhot ke daayre main aate hai
 Therefore also they cannot be appointed
 rajya sarkaar ko apni taraf se chhot dene kaa adhikaar hasil nahin he
 The comments ek taraf hamaare saamne niyamon kaa ulanghan kar 1 lakh 78 hazaar logon ko niyamit kiye jane kaa daawa he to duusari taraf hamaara daayitv he ki ham kanoon ke raaj ko kaayam rakhen
 We also have to respect that under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, children between 6 and 14 years should get education from properly trained teachers
 adaalat ke faisle ko samajhane ke liye hamane samvidhan visheshgy faizan mustafaa sahab kii madad lene ja rahe hai unase samajhenge ki is faisle main kya guzaaish hai, kya visangityaan hai
 After this decision, is there any way left to the officials and ministers of UP government or not
 kya shiksha mitron ke paas koi kanoonee rasta bachaa he jisase ve apni 40,000 kii selary waapas le sakate hai or regular ho sakate hai
 After fulfilling the government's goal for 14 years, can anyone be thrown such, the honorarium of 10,000 is also a temporary arrangement, how long will their life last on this money
 supreme court ne apane faisle main likhaa he ki agar stop gap yani asthaayee taur par kisi ko padhaane ke liye rakhaa jaae to bhi ant main qualiphoid teacher kii hi niyukti hogi
 The court has used the term stop gap, but you think these people continued to teach from 2002 to 2014
 kya adaalat 12 saal kii seva ko stop gap maanati he, kya us 12 saal kii seva ke badale muawza nahin milanaa chahie tha
 The appointment of Shiksha Mitras was not only on contract but also according to the eligibility to become a teacher or the honorarium paid to the teacher

 We also have to respect that under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, children between 6 and 14 years should get education from properly trained teachers
 adaalat ke faisle ko samajhane ke liye hamane samvidhan visheshgy faizan mustafaa sahab kii madad lene ja rahe hai unase samajhenge ki is faisle main kya guzaaish hai, kya visangityaan hai
 After this decision, is there any way left to the officials and ministers of UP government or not
 kya shiksha mitron ke paas koi kanoonee rasta bachaa he jisase ve apni 40,000 kii selary waapas le sakate hai or regular ho sakate hai

 kya adaalat 12 saal kii seva ko stop gap maanati he, kya us 12 saal kii seva ke badale muawza nahin milanaa chahie tha
 On the one hand, we claim to have regularized 1 lakh 78 thousand people in violation of rules, on the other hand we have an obligation to uphold the rule of law
 hamen is baat kaa bhi sammaan rakhana he ki sarv shiksha abhiyaan ke tahat 6 se 14 saal ke bacchon ko uchit tareeke se prashikshit shikshakon se shiksha mili
 To understand the decision of the court, we are going to take the help of Faizan Mustafa Saheb, the constitution expert, to understand from him what are the chances and inconsistencies in this decision
 kya is faisle ke baad upi sarkaar ke adhikariyon or mantriyon ke paas koi rasta bachataa he yaa nahin bachataa he
 Is there any legal way left to Shiksha Mitras to withdraw his salary of 40,000 and become regular
 14 saal tak sarkaar ke lakshya ko puraa karne ke baad kya kisi ko aisa phenkaa ja saktaa he, 10,000 kaa maandey bhi asthaayee vyavastha he is paise par inkaa jivan kab tak chalegaa
 The Supreme Court has written in its judgment that even if the stop gap is temporarily kept for teaching someone, only qualified teacher will be appointed in the end
 adaalat ne stop gap shabd kaa istamaal kiya he, par aap sochie 2002 se 2014 tak ye log padhaate rahe
 Should the court consider 12 years of service as a stop gap, should there not have been compensation for that 12 years of service
 adaalat ke faisle ko samajhane ke liye hamane samvidhan visheshgy faizan mustafaa sahab kii madad lene ja rahe hai unase samajhenge ki is faisle main kya guzaaish hai, kya visangityaan hai
 After this decision, is there any way left to the officials and ministers of UP government or not

 com / fub5l5v7re — Virat Kohli (@ Cricvids1) September 3, 2017 loksabhaa chunaav ke chauthe charan kaa matdaan sampann ho chukaa he or saat charnon vaale is chunaav main 3 charan kii voting or baaki he
 Voting has been done in 18 seats in 42 seats of West Bengal in the last four phases, and four times the people of the state have voted out of their homes in large numbers
 bengal main banpar voting ke bich hinsa kii ghatnaayen bhi lagaataar huin hai
 Despite this, it has failed to reduce the enthusiasm of its voters
 pashchim bengal main vaise to matdaan fisadi zyada hi rahata he or agar pichley do loksabhaa chunaavon kii baat karen to desh ke anya rajyon kii tulana main yahaan sabase zyada vot pade hai
 81 in Bengal in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections
 40 fisadi vot pade the or 2014 kii modi lahar main bhi rajya kii 82
 17 percent of the public exercised their franchise
 bengal kii banpar voting dikhaati he ki vibhinn dalon kaa kader yahaan apane netaaon ke saath majbootee se khadaa he
 Incidents of severe heat and violence are also insufficient to break the morale of the people of Bengal
 banpar voting or zyada hinsapahale charan main bengal kii 2 siton par 81 fisadi voting hui to duusare charan main 3 siton par 81
 68 percent votes were cast
 iske alaava tisare charan main 5 siton par 79
 There was 36 voting and in the fourth phase on Monday, 8 seats were cast in the state
 is chauthe charan main bhi bengal ke 76
 66 voters voted in favor of their party
 ab tak hue chunaav main rajya main 80 fisadi ke kareeb ausat voting ho chuki he
 In the last four phases, incidents of violence were also seen from different areas of the state
 chauthe charan main bijepi ke kabje vaali asanasol seat par tiemasi or bijepi samarthakon main jhadap dekhne ko mili
 Even an FIR has been filed against Union Minister and BJP MP Babul Supriyo
 tiemasi or bijepi donon ne hi chauthe charan kii voting ke bich chunaav ayog main ek-duusare ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karai he
 On the other hand incidents of nuisance have also been reported from Virbhum district
 jabaki isse pehle tisare charan main sipiem saansad mohammad saleem ke kaphile par voting ke dauraan islampur main hamalaa hua tha
 Here the history of electoral violence is old, the recently concluded body elections proved to be the biggest example of this
 pichley loksabhaa chunaav main purna bahumat ke saath satta main ai modi sarkaar ke liye bengal kisi litmus test se kam nahin he
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP President Amit Shah themselves keep a close watch on Bengal
 party kaa daawa he ki soobe main is baar unhen pehle se kaaphi zyada siten milengi
 Bengal has a total of 42 Lok Sabha seats and the last time TMC won 36 seats here
 iske alaava congress sirf 4 or left 2 siton par simat gaya tha
 BJP had got 2 seats then but in this election the party has a target of winning more than 20 seats
 bijepi ne centre main satta hasil karne ke baad left kaa sabase purana garh tripura dhaha diya or vahaan vidhansabha chunaav jeet akele sarkaar banaakar itihaas rach diya
 Now the bjp's focus is on states like Odisha and Bengal, where regional parties are dominating
 modi Vs mamtamodi or mamata kii siyaasi jang kisi se chuphi hui nahin he
 If a leader is known for the sharpest attack on the government sitting at the center, then his name is Mamta Banerjee
 2014 main bijepi ko bengal main sirf 2 loksabhaa siten mili thim, lekin party ne pichley 5 saal main yahaan apane sanghathan ko kaaphi majboot kar liya he
 As a result, the BJP has become the second-ranked party in Bengal from number four in the state
 vahiin, ab bangladeshi ghuspaithiyon kaa mudda ho yaa phir NRC aise tamaam jwalanth muddon par donon dalon ke bich talavaarein pehle se khinchi hui hai
 However, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee does not want to give any space to the BJP in Bengal
 yahi vajah he ki donon hi partiyon ke kaaryakarta apane netaa ko majboot karne ke iraade se vot karne jate hai or party ke prati unke junun kaa gavaah yah badhata voting pratishat banataa he
 It is also being said that to compensate the losses from states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, BJP has chosen bengal-odisha
 in sabhi rajyon se 2014 ke chunaav main bijepi ko apaar samarthan or siten hasil hui thim lekin is baar use doharaa paanaa chunauteepurn sabit hoga
 In such a situation, the bjp's strategy is that if there is loss of seats in these states, then it can be compensated by performing better in a state like Bengal
 iske liye kaaryakartaaon ko saaf sandesh bhi die gaye hai

 modi sarkaar ne teen talaak ko jurm ghoshit kar iske liye sajaa mukarrar karne ke liye puri tarah se qamar kas lee he
 The Central Government on Thursday introduced 'the Muslim Women Protection of Rights in Marriage Act' bill in the Lok Sabha
 is vidheyak ko lekar muslim sanghathan naaraaz hai, to modi sarkaar ise muslim mahilaon ke shashaktikaran ke liye aitihaasik kadam bataa rahi he
 Aaj Tak talked to all the Muslim women of the country about the bill being brought against triple talaq
 muslim mahilaayein ek sur main teen talaak kii mukhaalafat karti hai, lekin pati ko jail jate bhi nahin dekhnaa chaahati he
 But for the triple talaq to be completely banned, it is definitely standing in favor of making laws
 aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay se padhi or dilli ke enjio main kaam kar raheen ujama parveen kahati hai, ' muslim mahilaon kii behatari ke liye sarkaar nayaa kanoon laa rahi he, to khushi kii baat he
 The government should enact laws to help Muslim women and not to create problems
 bina vichaar vimarsh ke agar koi kanoon laayaa ja rahaa he, to wo sirf thopane jaisaa he
 'ujma Parveen said that the provisions of the bill which are coming up in the bill, there is objection on many things
 third party kii shikaayat par ection kii baat kahi gai he
 Also, if a husband divorces three, the marriage will not end
 lekin pati ko sajaa hogi
 How will wife and children be looked after in such a condition? sarkaar agar vaaki muslim mahilaon kii behatari chaahati he, to open charchaa karne ke baad kanoonee amalijama pahanaaya jaae
 Neha Farheen, who is studying in journalism, says that three divorces are an evil in favor of Muslim women
 muslim samaaj main choti-choti baton par log apni patniyon ko talaak de rahe hai
 In such a situation, a strict law should be made on triple talaq so that it can be completely stopped
 iske alaava mahilaon ko barabari kaa haq mili, jisase wo puure sammaan ke saath samaaj main ji sake
 Rana Khan, who is doing handicraft export business, says triple talaq is not a part of Islam
 sarkaar jo kanoon bana rahi he
 This will end the reconciliation that remains after the divorce between husband and wife
 sarkaar ko hamaare sharia main dakhsandaji nahin kerani chahie
 The government should take steps for the upliftment of Muslim women and not for political gains
 uttar pradesh ke oonchaahar kii rahane vaali afroj jahaan kahati hai ki teen talaak sharia ke khilaaf he
 It should be completely banned
 iske liye kanoon banaaya janaa chahie, lekin muslim samudaay kii mahilaon or ulimaon se baatcheet karne ke baad modi sarkaar koi kadam uthaae
 Sabiha Parveen Ansari, a teacher by profession living in Rae Bareli, says that three divorces are ruining the lives of Muslim women
 is par roak lagaai jaani chahie
 Legislation should be made for this, but in light of Sharia and not against Sharia
 nazibabad kii atikunisha kahati hai ki teen talaak par roak lagaai jaani chahie, kyonki islam bhi ise sahi nahin maanata he
 Such loopholes should be removed through social awareness rather than law
 sarkaar jo kanoon laa rahi he, usamen teen talaak koi detaa he to use jail ho jaae
 In such a situation, problems will arise in front of the family
 sajaa se behatar ye hai ki pati kii sampatti main patni ko hissedaar banaaya jaae
 Sadaf Javed, doing MA from the history department of Jamia Millia Islamia University in Delhi, says the triple talaq is against the Islamic Sharia
 modi sarkaar jis tarah se vidheyak pesh kar rahi he, ye bhi sahi nahin he
 This issue should be discussed with everyone including the Muslim Personal Law Board

 goduliya par phool bechney vaali amba kii chintaa mahangaai ko lekar he
 He said, 'modi Babu could not reduce inflation, and everything is right' means that Modi Babu could not reduce inflation, everything else is fine

 com / wqgeilopfb— Pakistan Cricket (@therealpcb) May 23, 2019 Pakistan's current team can take inspiration from the World Cup winning team led by Imran Khan's charismatic captain in 1992 in this case
 1992 vishwa cap se pehle bhi team lay main nahin thi
 Even after such a performance, no team would like to take it lightly, as the team won the Champions Trophy title in 2017 under the same conditions in England
 jeet kii raah main lautne ke liye pakistan ko kshetrarakshan or gendbaaji main sudhaar karnaa hoga
 Team coach Mickey Arthur has also cited this as a cause for concern
 england ke khilaaf do maichon main team 358 or 340 ranon ke lakshya kaa bachaav nahin kar saki, jabaki do anya maichon main bhi gendbaajon ne 350 se zyada ran lutaa die
 The good thing for the team is that the batsman is in rhythm and is doing well in the conditions of England

 The Congress is now holding a dialogue meeting after being surrounded from all sides on the issue of price rise and corruption
 congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne isi baithak main kaha he ki sarkaar ko majaburi main kathor aarthik faisle lene pade
 Opposition will get 'tough answer' Sonia Gandhi attacked the opposition and said that he only wants to get power, hence the UPA is criticizing the government
 sonia gandhi ne kaha ki vipaksh ko sakhti se jawaab dena hoga
 Sonia Gandhi asked the Congress workers to understand the compulsion of the party
 unhone congress ke mantriyon se apil kii he ki ve congress ke kaaryakartaaon or padaadhikariyon kii baaten sunen
 He also asked the ministers to go to the party office of their respective state
 sonia ne kaha ki sarkaar or congress party ke bich aage bhi behatar samvaad hona chahie
 Criticizing Kejriwal's statement on Sonia Gandhi, Nishansonia Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal said why she does not take steps against corruption
 gauratlab he ki dilli se sate faridabad main pradhanmantri manmohan singh se lekar congress ke tamaam diggaj mishan 2014 kii taiyaari main jute hai
 Congress's Chintan camp continues at Surajkund from 10 am on Friday
 congress kaa chintan shivi shaam tak chalegaa
 In the political struggle of 2019, the campaign that Congress took with the BJP to unite opposition parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party, that form of the grand alliance is not only disintegrating as the voting date comes, but the parties coming together on one platform Now they have come face to face in the electoral arena
 uttar pradesh main mahagathbandhan kii yah cold war tikat vitaran ke baad or zyada spasht ho gai he
 The Congress has struck a deep blow on the BSP-SP coalition, which dreams of Delhi, with the help of its Muslim candidates
 akele pashchim upi kii chaar aisi loksabhaa seat hai, jahaan congress ke muslim ummidavaar khaskar basapa supremeo mayawati ke liye hanikaarak sabit ho sakate hai
 Moradabad, Bijnor, Saharanpur and Amroha are the four Lok Sabha constituencies from where Congress has given a chance to Muslim faces
 muradabad se imran pratapgadhi, bijanour se nasimuddin siddiki, saharanpur se imran masood or amroha se raashid alvi ko tikat diya gaya he
 These four are not just candidates, but they also have their own special identity
 imran pratapgadhi mashhoor shaayar hai or janata ke bich unka craij kaaphi he
 Naseemuddin Siddiqui was once called Mayawati's right hand, and for a long time he served as the number two in the BSP
 imran masood pashchim upi main congress ke sabase mukhar chehre ke taur par ubhare hai
 However, his bold statements have become the focus of controversy across the country
 rashtriya pravaktaa hone ke naate raashid alvi puure desh main apni pahchaan rakhte hai
 That is, the stature of these leaders is indicating that the coalition candidates may get a shock here
 upi kii raajnneeti par khaas pakad rakhane vaale varisht patrkaar yusuf ansaari ne ajtak se baatcheet main bataaya ki aisa karnaa congress kii ranneeti kaa ahm hissaa he
 Mayawati was constantly attacking the Congress, after which the Congress changed its strategy and decided to field Muslim candidates in the seats it is expected to win
 yusuf ansaari ke mutabik, jin loksabhaa siton par 20 fisadi se zyada muslim aabaadi he, or vahaan gathbandhan kaa koi muslim ummidavaar nahin he, vahaan congress ne apane majboot muslim ummidavaar utaarne kii ranneeti apanaai he
 But the Congress nomination against BSP candidate Danish Ali from Amroha gives his intentions and strength
 yusuf ansaari ke mutabik, mayawati kaa sakht rukh dekhakar hi basapa ko sabak sikhaane kii niyat se congress ne kuch nirnay liye hai, congress se kareebi rakhane vaale amroha ke ummidavaar danish ali ke khilaaf bhi raashid alvi ko utaarne kaa faisla liya gaya he
 Congress candidate from Bijnor seat Nasimuddin Siddiquito, can this strategy of the Congress really harm the coalition and especially the BSP, now this is a big question
 in chaaron siton ke sameekaran dekhen to gathbandhan ke liye vipareet paristhitiyaan paidaa ho sakati hai
 In these four Lok Sabha constituencies, not only is the Muslim vote in a decisive role, but it also appears to lead
 muradabad seat par 45 fisadi, bijanour seat par 38 fisadi, saharanpur seat par 39 fisadi or amroha seat 37 fisadi musalmaan he
 The Congress had earlier nominated a Gurjar leader Indira Bhati as a candidate for the Bijnor Lok Sabha seat, but the BSP also gave a chance to Gurjar leader Malook Nagar
 duusari taraf bijepi ne sitting saansad kunwar bhaaratendra par phir se bharosa jataayaa
 Seeing the Hindu candidate of the alliance, the Congress changed its decision and made Nasimuddin Siddiqui the candidate
 isaki badi vajah yahaan ke 5 lakh musalmaan matadaata hai
 While BSP candidate Malook Nagar is eyeing 1 lakh Gurjars and 3 lakh Dalit voters
 maluk nagar gurjar hai, lekin unke samaaj kaa vot bhaajapa ko jaataa rahaa he
 On the other hand, Shivpal Yadav's Progressive Samajpadi Party has fielded Eelam Singh Gurjar
 aise main nasimuddin siddiki jaise bade kad vaale netaa ko utarkar congress ne na sirf basapa ko jhatka diya he, balki apni jeet kii sambhaavna ko bhi majbootee di he
 Half of the Muslim population in Moradabad can also become a problem for the alliance
 muradabad seat par congress ne pradesh upi adhyaksh raaj babbar ko pratyaashee ghoshit kiya tha, lekin jab bijepi ne apane sitting saansad kunwar sarvesh ko phir se mauka diya or sapa-basapa ke kisi talmail kii sambhaavna puri tarah khatm ho gai to congress ne turant apana faisla waapas le liya or mashhoor shaayar imran pratapgadhi ko mauka de diya
 In the alliance, this seat has gone to the sp's account, but the candidate's name has not been finalized yet
 yahaan kareeb 45 fisadi musalmaan he
 So far, out of 17 elections held on this seat, 11 times Muslim candidates have won from here
 2009 main is seat se congress ke star ajaharuddin bhi jeet chuke hai
 In such a situation, the Congress has once again fielded the famous face as Imran Pratapgarhi from this seat
 saharanpur se congress pratyaashee imran masudaaise hi congress ke ek star pratyaashee saharanpur seat par hai, jinka naam imran masood he
 Imran Masood, who belongs to an old political family, received 34 per cent of the votes of the Modi wave in 2014, while Raghav Lakhanpal, who won from the BJP, got 39 per cent of the votes and the BSP was reduced to just 19 per cent of the vote
 ab sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne 39 fisadi aabaadi vaale saharanpur kshetra se haji fajalurrahman ko mauka diya he
 In such a situation, this time the battle of Saharanpur seat seems to be changing in the triangular contest, although the clean image of Haji Fazlur Rahman is making him more vulnerable
 thik aisa kii kadaa muqabla amroha seat par bhi hota dikh rahaa he, jahaan 37 fisadi musalmaan hai
 Kunwar Danish Ali, who joined the BSP after leaving the JDS, is contesting from Amroha seat, but the Congress has increased his challenge by removing Rashiv Alvi
 donon netaa rashtriya tivi par ek saath bahes karte najar aate hai
 Rashid Alvi has also been an MP
 aise main in donon kii fite bijepi ko bhi bada mauka de sakati he
 Congress candidate from Amroha seat Rashid Alvi, another big question is whether the Muslim voter will vote for the Congress candidate in front of the SP-BSP alliance against the BJP
 is par varisht patrkaar yusuf ansaari kaa maananaa he ki congress kii taraf musalamaanon kaa rujhaan badha he or isaki badi vajah mayawati par bharosa kam hona he
 According to him, this thinking is emerging in the Muslim society that Mayawati should not go with the BJP after the elections
 aise main musalmaan mayawati or akhilesh yadav ke gathbandhan ke saamne congress ke majboot muslim ummidavaar ko chun saktaa he
 After eight months of the withdrawal of the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, the President has now allowed Lt
 Governor Najeeb Jung to call BJP to form the government
 bijepi pehle bhi sadan main sabase badi party thi or usne us samay sarkaar banane main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai thi
 The House was in a state of suspension because of this
 ab do anya rajyon main bhi jeet ke baad bijepi netritv ko lagane laga he ki yahaan phir se chunaav karwaane se acha yah hoga ki uski sarkaar bane
 It is evident that the President has given his permission in accordance with that desire
 dilli vidhansabha main kul 70 siten hai, jisamen se 31 bijepi ne jiti thim lekin uske teen vidhayak saansad ban gaye or un vidhaan sabha kshetron main upachunaav hone hai
 He feels that he will win in these by-elections
 sambhawatah isi vishwaas kii vajah se party ab rajya main apni sarkaar banvaanaa chaahati he
 On the other hand, the attitude of the second largest party Aam Aadmi Party in this matter kept changing
 pehle to usne vidhaan sabha bhang karne kaa prastaav diya lekin baad main vah apane is stand se mukar gai
 He wrote to the Lieutenant Governor not to dissolve the House
 ab bijepi sarkaar banane ke liye khadi ho gai he or use uparajyapal kii hari jhandi mil gai he
 Obviously, when she forms the government, there will be a lot of tussle and there will be allegations of horse trading
 aam aadmi party ne aisa aarope kai baar lagaaya
 However, now the exercise of forming a government has started in Delhi and the BJP will have to make a lot of papad because it is not that easy
 uske paas apane vidhayakon ke alaava ek akali vidhayak kaa saath he
 It remains to be seen how the party will fill this gap
 use nirdaleey vidhayakon kaa saath lenaa hoga or yah bahut mushkil nahin he kyonki sach to yah he ki koi bhi vidhayak itani jaldi chunaav nahin chahta
 Arvind Kejriwal may make tall claims, but most of the mlas of his party are running away from the election
 shaayad yahi ek aisa point he jo bijepi ko sarkaar banavaane main madad karegaa
 Congress leaders may raise their voice against this, but they know that if elections are held, the boat can sink
 mahanagar main party kii haalat itani kharaab he ki uske liye turant chunaav ladanaa mahangaa sauda hoga
 He was not going to come to power anyway
 ab agar chunaav hue to vidhayak kaa pratishthit pad bhi ja saktaa he
 But amidst all this, what is the answer of the Central Government to the legitimate question of the Supreme Court, why did it take so long to take this decision? dilli main pehali baar chunavi samar main utarane vaali aam aadmi party ne chamatkaari pradarshan kiya he
 But like 'AAP' many new parties in the past have done well in elections
 pichley tees saal ke dauraan gathit raajnneetik dalon kii baat karen to inamen se jin dalon kaa gathan karne vaale netaa kisi bhi raajnneetik party se nahin jude rahe, unki party kaa pradarshan shandaar rahaa he
 Arvind Kejriwal, who left the Indian Revenue Service and entered politics for the first time under the leadership of 'AAP', performed brilliantly and pushed the Congress to third place in Delhi

 maharashtra ke rajyapal ke shankaranarayanan pad se istipha dene ke kendra ke dabaav kaa buudhvaar ko pratirodh karte najar aae

 West Bengal Governor MK Narayanan said today that he has not yet resigned
 shankaranarayanan ne kaha ki yadi nirnay lene vaala koi 'uchit praadhikaar' unase istipha dene ko kahata he to vah aisa karne ke bare main sochenge
 Sankaranarayanan said, 'union Home Secretary Anil Goswami called me twice last week
 maine unhen koi jawaab nahin diya, rajyapal kaa pad sanvaidhanik hota he
 He is the President's representative, he is appointed by the President
 kisi jimmedaar vyakti ne mujhe ye pad chhodane ke liye likhit main nahin kaha

 Meanwhile, Karnataka Governor HR Bhardwaj met Home Minister Rajnath Singh and spoke in riddles about the resignation
 atakalein hai ki nagaland ke rajyapal ashvini kumaar jald hi apana istipha saunp sakate hai
 Kumar, while protesting against the Centre's move to change the governors appointed during the UPA regime, wondered whether the Governors of any particular color in the states want the government
 unhone kaha ki unka maananaa he ki vibhinn rajyon main rajyapalon ko badalane ke peeche vajah nishchit taur par raajnneetik he
 a new government has come and 'I believe that it wants the states to have governors of one color
 ' On the other hand, while refusing to resign, Bhardwaj said that the Governor cannot resign unless someone else comes in his place
 unhone kaha ki samvidhan main praavdhaan he ki jab tak nae rajyapal kii niyukti na ho jaae, vartmaan rajyapal pad par bana rahegaa
 Bhardwaj, who was seeking an appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday, said the governor cannot resign
 kal uttar pradesh ke rajyapal bi el joshi ne istipha de diya tha kyonki modi sarkaar ne purv kii sarkaar dwaara niyukt rajyapalon ko hataane kii prakriya shuru kar di
 Bhardwaj said that he had not spoken to the Home Secretary for the last five years

 It is believed that Kerala Governor Sheila Dixit and four other governors have been asked to withdraw in the context of changing the government at the Center

 The findings of the second charge sheet filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Bhanwari Devi murder case on March 1 have come to light
 vah sahaayak nurse thi
 She went missing on 1 September last year
 khabar thi ki vah pradesh ke jan swasthya abhiyantriki mantri rahe mahipal maderna or congress vidhayak malakhan singh bishnoi ko blackmel kar rahi he
 She went missing when the video CD containing her illicit sex relationship with the duo was allegedly in possession of her
 sibiai ke yah maamla haath main lete hi maderna ko sarkaar se hataa diya gaya tha
 He and Congress MLA Malkhan were arrested and sent to jail
 chargeshit bataati he ki is puure kisse kii shuruyaat 2002 main us samay hui, jab bhavari apane tabadale ke silsile main malakhan se mili
 The illicit physical relationship between them turned into love
 malakhan is ilaake ke namchin netaa or pradesh kii pichhali congress sarkaar main mantri rahe ram singh bishnoi kaa betaa he
 Bhanwari also had a daughter from Malkhan, who is his second daughter
 isi bich malakhan ne uski mulaakaat apane gahare dost congressi netaa mahipal maderna se kara di
 Maderna also started indulging in sex with Bhanwari only after knowing Malkhan
 baat asal main vahaan se bigadani shuru hui jab bhavari ne malakhan se janmi apni beti ko adhikaar dilaane ke liye usase morcha lenaa shuru kar diya
 If Bhanwari did not get a ticket in the assembly or local body elections, he started to fear that Malkhan should not sideline him
 usne saarvajanik sthanon par uski fajihat kerani shuru kar di or yahaan tak ki police main uske khilaaf shikaayat bhi kii
 Malkhan's family was angry about Bhanwari
 or dhire-dhire malakhan ne bhi usase duuri banani shuru kar di
 He asked brother Parasram Bishnoi and sister Indra Bishnoi to get in touch with Bhanwari so that he could be pacified
 malakhan bhavari ke upar khub paise kharch karata tha
 Gradually Bhanwari started getting vocal
 usne malakhan or uske parivaar ko bataaya ki uske paas ek sidi he, jisamen uske saath malakhan ke sex sambandhon kii footage he
 Sensing such danger, the Bishnoi family decided to divert Bhanwari's anger towards Maderna
 use salaah di gai ki agar vah maderna ke saath apane sex sambandhon kii sidi bana le to acha-khaasaa paisa kama sakati he
 All this was being done so that Malkhan gets a chance to become a minister when Maderna loses his position in the trap
 disambar, 2008 ke vidhansabha chunaavon main sura or sundari ke shaukeen in donon mitron ke bich kuch khatpat ho gai
 Bhanwari and Indra first tried to make a CD of Maderna's sex relationship with Bhanwari's sister-in-law Gudiya, but Gudiya refused
 iske baad bhavari ne tay kiya ki vah maderna ke saath apane sex sambandhon kii sidi taiyaar karegi
 He also made that CD at the Hotel Gangaur of Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) in Jaipur, but the film could not be made due to not keeping the camera angle hidden there
 baad main or filmein bhi banaai gayi
 One of these was built in a farmhouse in Jhalmond near Jodhpur in Maderna
 sibiai kaa kahana he ki ek sidi malakhan singh kii bhi thi lekin uske haath lagane se pehle hi vah nasht kar di gai
 At first a group of Bishnois were very close to Malkhan but gradually expressed their commitment to Maderna in the power game
 bhavari se sidi hasil karne ke liye sajeesh rachane main usee samooh ne nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai
 In the process, he also made money, delivered cds and tapes to the media and slowly persuaded Maderna and Malkhan to get Bhanwari killed
 kisi thriller kii tarah is kahani main ek-ke-baad-ek kirdaar judate gaye
 Sohanlal Bishnoi was a contractor in the Public Health Engineering department
 upar tak uski acchhee pahunch thi
 Used to get officers to do their desired posting
 bhavari se sidi hasil karne ke liye usne use bahan bana liya
 Sohanlal paid eight lakhs from Maderna in the name of giving it to Bhanwari
 le liye lekin use kabhi nahin die
 Bhanwari gave Rs 50 lakh to deliver the CD
 nakad maange or uske baad ek kaagaj par bhi likhakar dene ko taiyaar ho gai ki ab uske paas koi sidi nahin he
 Maderna was paid Rs 10 lakh on his signature
 nakad or 40 lakh ru
 Agreed to give by check
 yah puraa maamla aage sidi ke aasapaas ghoomane laga
 Meanwhile, the people of Malkhan took some dvds and cds from Bhanwari's house
 malakhan kheme ne maderna kii ek sidi ko media main li kar diya
 The CD was delivered to Maderna through a Congress leader, Sunil Gurjar
 bhavari ke liye ajmer main ek bhukhand bhi kharida gaya, is vaade ke saath ki malakhan us par ghar banavaa degaa
 It seems that at one time both Malkhan and Maderna thought it appropriate to settle the matter by getting the entire CD by paying the price
 lekin jab unhen pataa chalaa ki ek sidi sabhi taraf prasaarit ho rahi he to unhen janch gaya ki ab bhavari par bharosa nahin kiya ja saktaa
 It is possible that he had more copies
 is mode par ve bhavari ko khatm kar dene ke sohanlal ke suzav par raji ho gaye
 Sohanlal, despite being Maderna's special in this case, was acting at the behest of his cousin Malkhan
 maderna ne apni ore se ek sthaneey netaa or apane khaas sahiram bishnoi ko is kaam par lagaaya tha
 Indra was acting as a liaison between Bhanwari and others here
 in logon ne apharan kii kuch juthi vaardaaton ke jariye bhavari ko daraane kii koshish kii
 On this, he got the license of arms with the help of police officer Lakaram
 maderna ne lakhram kii duty bhavari ko kisi tarah se shant karne main lagaai thi
 But in the end everyone concluded that the matter of blackmailing could be solved only by killing Bhanwri
 bhavari ke pati ko use akele safar karke sohanlal se milane ke liye raji kiya gaya
 He made her sit in the car with the promise of money
 bhavari ko unki niyat par shaq ho gaya or chalati gaadi main hi uski hatya kar di gai
 Sahiram Bishnoi contacted a gang to hide his corpse
 bishna ram or uskaa giroh is kaam ke liye raji ho gaya lekin usne ek shart rakhih maderna ilaake main kisaanon kii jameen kharidne ke maamle main uske khilaaf dhokhadhadi ke maamalon main uski madad karenge
 Bhanwari Devi's body was burnt and her bones were crushed with a baseball bat
 phir sabko mitti main milakar indira gandhi nahar kii sahaayak nahar main phenk diya gaya
 Bhanwari's goods were also thrown there
 sibiai kaa daawa he ki usne sahaayak nurse bhavari kii ghadi vahaan se chaalu haalat main baraamad kar lee he
 He has also recovered some remains but it is not yet decided that they belong to Bhanwari
 hatya ke uddeshy ke bare main sibiai kaa paksh tagada he
 If the CBI succeeds in presenting strong evidence during the trial, then every person, including Maderna and Malkhan, can be convicted, who are accused of being aware of the conspiracy to murder
 samasya yah he ki paristhitijanya sakshya to bahut majboot hai, lekin sibiai ke paas is baat kaa sidhaa saboot nahin he ki malakhan or maderna ne hatya karne kaa nirdesh diya
 CBI can get much more success in punishing those accused of committing murder
 indira bishnoi or parsaram bishnoi mukhya shadyantrkariyon ke taur par saamne aae hai to bishna ram or uske saathiyon ko saboot mitaane kaa doshi tehraae jane kii sambhaavna zyada he
 In the entire charge sheet, Maderna appears as a victim of the conspiracy of Malkhan's family
 yahaan tak ki khud bhavari devi bhi maderna se badla lene ke liye us tarah utaavali nahin thi
 Bhanwari is believed to have created a ruckus at Maderna's house only once, when he was convinced that Maderna was behind his transfer
 sibiai chargeshit main sanket diya gaya he ki yah malakhan ke parivaar kii sajeesh ho sakati he ki pehle uskaa tabadalaa karvaa diya jaae or phir malakhan uskaa tabadalaa radd karavaaen
 But before this, the blame should be put on Maderna
 chunki unki sidi pehle hi prachaarit ho chuki thi, is kaaran maderna jaanate the ki agar bhavari kii hatya hui, to sabase pehle unheen par shaq kiya jayega
 But legal sources say that Maderna was also fed up with blackmailing
 apane khilaaf sajeesh main unhen sohanlal kii bhoomika par bhi andeh tha
 After Bhanwari was killed, it would be difficult to confirm the truth of Bhanwari being in the videotape that accompanied him
 sibiai kaa yah aarope zyada shashakt sakshya ho saktaa he ki maderna ne hatya ke baad, sahiram bishnoi ke jariye sohanlal ko 10 lakh ru
 Had paid sajeesh par amal hone ke samay sahiram kaa mahipal ke ghar par maujuud rahanaa bhi maderna kii bhoomika ko sabit karata he
 Sahiram's hiring of Bhanwari to bring him alive or dead also proves that the murder was pre-planned
 aropatr se pataa chalata he ki saare aropiyon ko 2 sitambar tak hatya kii baat maaloom thi
 The CBI has mentioned Bhanwari Devi's association with more leaders and well-known people, but none of them has been named
 shuruaati jaanch main bhi malakhan se zyada dhyaan maderna par hi tha
 a closer investigation into the role of Malkhan's family began when the issue arose as to who could benefit from trapping Maderna
 maderna ke khilaaf chunaav haarane vaale shanbhu singh khetsar kaa bhi naam liya gaya he ki unhone amarchand ko maderna ko mukhya sandigdh bataate hue maamla darj karne ke liye uksaaya tha
 The defense can argue that Bhanwari went with Sohanlal on her own free will
 or uskaa apharan hua hi nahin tha, yah ki saare logon ko bhavari par yah dabaav daalane ke liye supaari di gai thi ki vah sari sidi saunp de
 And also that he accidentally died due to jumping from a moving vehicle
 sibiai ne bhavari ko sadak durghatana main maravane kii sajeesh kaa ullekh kiya he, lekin yah spasht nahin kiya he ki yah sajeesh chhodkar us sajeesh ko kyon apanaaya gaya, jisamen ek darjan se zyada log shaamil the or jis sajeesh ko gupt banaae rakhana kathin tha
 Were the murderers believing themselves to be invincible so much that they dared to plot a murder of a person like Bhanwari? Comparison between Malkhan and Maderna, weak evidence against Maderna is given in the charge sheet
 aarope patr ke mutabik, hatya kaa aadesh dene vaale ke taur par sohanlal ne malakhan kaa naam liya tha
 Maderna only agreed with this
 isse maderna par hatya kii sajeesh karne ke aarope kii bajaae yah aarope lag saktaa he ki unhone is sajeesh ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 Malkhan appears less guilty than his sister Indra and brother Parasram
 sibiai ne yah chargeshit maderna or malakhan kii giraftaar ke 90 dinon ke bheetar pesh kii he, taaki unhen jamaanat milane se roka ja sake
 But the CBI still needs to gather more evidence
 use ummid he ki indra ko giraftaar karne ke baad kuch saboot haath lag jaaenge
 Secondly, the fate of the case rests on concrete evidence that Bhanwari was killed
 pani se nikaale gaye avasheshon se yah baat sabit nahin hoti
 The CBI will be able to prove everyone guilty only when it is able to make one or two accused its witnesses

he further said that every year the Dalit community celebrates the anniversary of the battle between Dalits and Marathas in bhima-koregaon
 lekin isse pehle aisi koi ghatana nahin hui
 After all, who is responsible for this violence? Kharge said that on the basis of historical evidence, Dalits who were fighting for the British in that war were not part of the army, so they were not allowed to fight with weapons

 In the last few days, the media has discussed in detail about the name written on my Twitter handle and poster
 ''unhone kaha, ''patrakaron se apil he ki agar naam ko lekar baat kii jaaegi to chunavi raajnneeti naam yaa jati par kendrit hoti jaaegi
 But the freedom of writing for journalists has never stopped
 vaise hi hamaari azaadi he ki kya khate hai yaa twitor handle par kya naam rakhte hai
 "the issue is not the name, the work should be done
 Ajatak had also asked this question, why do you think there was no need to remove the surname if you did not keep anything in the name? Were you afraid that your surname 'marlena' spread confusion? Can i go? Atishi had said, "actually i left my family surname many years back
 main chunaav prachaar main pehle naam kaa istemaal kar rahi hum kyonki mujhe lagata he ki mudda naam nahin balki kaam hona chahie
 "parents had given the nickname that after being appointed Lok Sabha in-charge from East Delhi, Atishi's surname 'marlena' was removed from the party website, posters and banners along with social media
 atishi kaa kahana tha ki marlena unka sarnem nahin he
 It is a surname given by his parents
 unhone yah bhi bhi bataaya tha ki unka sarnem singh he, lekin unhone khud ye faisla kiya ki chunaav ke liye wo sirf aatishi naam kaa hi istemaal karengi
 According to people close to Atishi, after being made the Lok Sabha in-charge, a rumor was started in East Delhi that Atishi was a foreigner or a Christian
 unke ek kareebi ke mutabik aatishi ke pita kaa naam vijay singh or maa kaa naam tripta wahi he
 The surname Marlena was given to him by his parents

 TDP, which had been an ally of the government till yesterday, may bring the proposal in Lok Sabha on Monday, on Friday TDP has decided to withdraw support from the government
 sadan main wiesar congress kii ore se aaj bhi prastaav laane kii koshish kii gai lekin hangaame kii vajah se yah pesh nahin ho sakaa
 The TDP cannot bring this proposal alone in the Lok Sabha as it requires the support of at least 50 members
 loksabhaa main tidipi ke paas sirf 16 saansad he
 In such a situation, this proposal cannot be presented in the House without the support of opposition parties
 prastaav laane kii prakriyasadan main jo bhi dal avishvaas prastaav laana chahta he pehle use sabhapati ko isaki likhit soochna deni hoti he
 The Chairman then asks any MP of that party to present it
 lekin yah tabhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he jab prastaav ko kam se kam 50 saansadon kaa samarthan hasil ho
 The House can hold this discussion and get re-voting done or the mps who support them are counted
 aamtaur main yah prastaav sarkaar ko giraane ke makasad se laayaa jaataa he jab koi sarkaar alpamat main aa jaati he
 But it is also being used to surround and warn governments
 beete dinon main kai prastaav aise bhi aae jab sarkaar ke paas paryaapt aankade the or use koi khatra nahin tha
 It is also evident from the current figures of the Modi government that it is not threatened by this proposal
 bijepi akele hi bahumat ke aankade (272) ko paar kar rahi he
 If NDA partners are included in this, then this number becomes quite a lot
 loksabhaa main dalwaar sthitiloksabhaa main bijepi ke paas 274 saansad hai

 In such a situation, even after TDP comes out of NDA, the government has the support of parties like Shiv Sena, LJP (6), Apna Dal (2), RLSP (3), JDU (2) and Akali (4)

 The 2G scam left behind in this uproar is the agenda of preparing the list of people called for appearance in the JPC, which the BJP says cannot be complete without Manmohan and Chidambaram

 madhya pradesh main vidhansabha chunaav ke liye chand maheene hi bache hai
 In such a situation, BJP brand politics related to cow seems to be caught in the neck of Shivraj Singh Chauhan government
 darasal, madhya pradesh main kamdhenu gaay abhayaarany (sancturi) project ko bade jorshor se shuru kiya gaya tha
 Located in Agar Malwa, Madhya Pradesh, it was the only century in the country that was promoted as a possible solution to the abandoned cows
 is sancturi main 6000 gaayon ko rakhane kii kshamta thi
 But the century has raised hands after 4000 cows and sheltering cows
 madhya pradesh gaay sangrakshan board ke adhyaksh swami akhileshwaranand kii ore se ye laal jhandi dikhaai gai he
 Please tell that Swami Akhileshwaranand is the only person who demanded to form a separate cow ministry
 madhya pradesh sarkaar ne swami akhileshwaranand ko cabinet mantri ke darje se to nawaja lekin jab gaay abhayaarany ke liye fund relies karne kaa sawaal aayaa to haath khinch liye
 Swami Akhileshwaranand told India Today, 'we have stopped taking more cows after 4000 cows
 hamaare paas sansaadhan nahin hai
 Farmers do not allow cows to enter the fields this season
 hamaare paas soochna he ki 10,000 gaayon ko rajasthan seemaa kii ore se sancturi kii ore dhakela ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, when there is already a shortage of resources and cows are allowed, it will be like inviting disaster
 ’madhya pradesh sarkaar ne chunaav aachaar samhita lagu hone se pehle aisi anek yojanaayen shuru kii hai jinke liye bahut dhan kii aavashyaktaa he
 In such a situation, the possibility of shifting the funds from existing schemes is negligible
 sthiti aisi ban gai he ki madhya pradesh sarkaar sancturi ke liye or fund jari nahin karne kii baat munh se kah bhinhin sakati
 Public Relations Minister Narottam Mishra, in response to the issue on behalf of the government, said, 'we have already taken 4000 destitute cows in Kamadhenu cow sanctuary and if there is any shortage of funds, the government will make sure to remove them
 ’congress ne is mudde par bijepi par nishaanaa saadhane main der nahin lagaai
 Congress spokesperson Shobha Ojha said, 'the government does politics on the cow but when it comes to doing something for them in the right way, the lack of funds starts crying
 sarkaar ke pasvigyapanon par betahasha banane ke liye paisa he lekin gaayon ke liye fund nahin he
 They only do politics in the name of the cow, but in reality they have nothing to do with the cow
 ’kamdhenu gau abhayaarany kaa shilanyas disambar 2012 main hua tha or ise gaayon ke liye sitambar 2017 main kholaa gaya
 The main purpose of the sanctuary was to save destitute cows from slaughter
 bataa den ki centre sarkaar ne 16 rajyon ke har jile main aise abhayaaranon ke liye 1000 acre van bhoomi dene kaa prastaav kiya tha jisase besahaara gaayon ko sahaara diya ja sake
 But in reality, the only such century that exists is struggling with the shortage of funds

 The Muslim population in these seats is 31, 28 and 46 percent respectively
 phir, bihar kii 9 siton (20 fisadi se adhik muslim aabaadi) main se bhaajapa ke paas abhi sirf 6 seat hai
 There are 17 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal where Muslim population is between 20% and 60%
 bhaajapa 2014 main in 17 siton main se ek bhi nahin jeet pai thi
 But this time, BJP general secretary in-charge of Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya claims, "the BJP will win at least 25 seats in Bengal
" 2014 kii 2 siton ke alaava bhaajapa 23 ve siten bhi jeetegi, jahaan muslim aabaadi thik-thaak he
 "the leaders of the Bengal Pradesh BJP acknowledge that the atmosphere has been created in favor of the BJP after pm's Wardha speech
 isi tarah padosi rajya assam main 8 siten aisi hai, jahaan muslim votaron kii aabaadi 24 fisadi se lekar 56 fisadi tak he
 The BJP has only 3 mps here
 uttar pradesh main 16 siten aisi hai jahaan muslim aabaadi 20 fisadi se adhik he
 The BJP won all these seats in 2014
 maharashtra kii 4 siten aisi hai jahaan muslim votaron kii aabaadi 20 fisadi se adhik he
 BJP and Shiv Sena won all these seats in 2014
 mushkil rahon kii ranneetidarasal vikaas ke naare or centre sarkaar kii yojanaon kii jagah hindutv kii raah par chalanaa us mushkil kii vajah se he jo modi sarkaar or bhaajapa ke saamne khadi he
 In Chhattisgarh, Congress promised loan waiver and increase in support price for crops and this promise reached the people
 chhattisgarh main chunaav se pehle yah rajya main charchaa kaa ahm mudda bana rahaa
 The BJP lost badly here
 is haar ne bhaajapa ko yah ehsaas kara diya ki kisaanon main centre sarkaar kii yojanaon ko lekar koi aakarshan nahin he
 The BJP tried to rectify this mistake and in the interim budget of 2019-20, farmers with landholding of up to two hectares would get Rs 6,000 annually
 nakad dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 This amount is Rs 2,000 every four months
 kii kist main dena tay kiya gaya
 The first installment was announced from December 2018 to ensure that farmers can get money as promised before the election
 lekin congress ne apane chunaav ghoshnaa-patr main 20 fisadi sabase garib logon ko salanaa 72,000 ru
 Promises to execute justice scheme to provide cash
 haalanki bhaajapa ne ise divaswapn or congress kaa jhooth vaada kahkar prachaarit karne kii koshish kii lekin is yojana ko lekar logon ke bich charchaa shuru ho gai
 Randeep Singh Surjewala, the head of the Congress's media department, says, "the BJP tried hard to get the justice plan out of the discussion
" iske liye unhone antariksh main vaigyanikon kii uplabdhi (e-sat) ko bhi modi sarkaar kii uplabdhi ke rup main prachaarit karne kii koshish kii
 The Prime Minister tweeted and told the whole country that he is going to announce something big
 "bakaul surajevaala, pradhanmantri ne yah maahaul isliye banane kii koshish kii, taaki 'nyaay' kii charchaa peeche chali jaae ''lekin modi or amit shah apni is koshish main safal nahin ho sake
 "the second reason for the bjp's return to Hindutva is the assessment of political arithmetic
 uttar pradesh, bihar, jharkhand or maharashtra jaise rajyon jahaan 2014 main bhaajapa ko badi safalataa hasil hui thi, vahaan is baar muqabla aasaan nahin he
 The vote share of the SP-BSP and RLD alliance in Uttar Pradesh seems to be overshadowing the vote share of BJP in 2014
 bihar main rajd-congress-araspi-ham or viypi party (mukesh saahani) kaa vot share bhale endie (bhaajapa-jad (you)-lojpa) par baari nahin dikh rahaa ho lekin muqabla kaante kaa banataa lag rahaa he
 Maharashtra and Jharkhand are more or less similar
 matlab 182 siton par muqabla kaante kaa he
 RJD spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Manoj Jha says, "if the Modi government has done so much for farmers, poor and youth, then why is there an effort to polarize Hindu votes?" In his last speech in the last Lok Sabha elections, Modi was only singing the voice of youth, employment and 'sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'
 is baar ve shuruyaat main hi alpsankhyak-bahusankhyak kii baat kar rahe hai kyonki unhen lagata he ki haari hui baaji ko taalane ke liye hindutv ke alaava koi doosraa chaara nahin he
 But whatever they do, there are only a few days left for the Modi government to pull out of power
 "hindutv kaa saharapaschim bengal, uttar pradesh, bihar main loksabhaa kii 162 siten hai
 There are a good number of Muslim voters in these states
 haalanki ikki-dukki (jaise, kishanganj) siton ko chhod den, kahin bhi muslim voter apane dam par seat jitaane kii sthiti main nahin hai
 But a large section of Hindu voters in these states is also the core voter of anti-bjp parties
 masalan, bihar main yadav rajd ke saath hai to uttar pradesh main yadavon ko sapa or dalit basapa kaa voter mana jaataa he
 In such a situation, Hindu voters who are politically divided among Dalits, Backward and Forward castes, can join with any party only when polarization in the name of Hindutva becomes the most important issue of elections
 baharhaal, paanch saal satta main rahane ke baad modi or amit shah kii jodi ko yah lagane laga he ki sirf vikaas yaa sarkaar kii uplabdhiyon main vah dhar shesh nahin he, jiske dam par purna bahumat hasil kiya ja sake
 The relatively easy situation before Modi in 2014 was because at that time there was a UPA government led by the Congress at the Center
 tab modi ke paas siyaasi hamale karne ke liye ek thos target tha
 This time Modi himself is the head of the central government and the BJP and NDA governments in most states
 aise main modi ke paas is baar atake karne ke liye majboot target nahin he
 He has no other option but to just tell his government's achievements
 lekin uplabdhi aisi nahin he, jo virdohi dalon ko baikfoot par dhakel sake
 In such a situation, only one and only savior issue remains Hindutva
 congress ko hindu virdohi or pakistan parast bataa kar bhaajapa frontroot par khelnaa chaahati he, jisaki shuruyaat pradhanmantri modi ne kii he
 But the question is, is it easy? *** beeti 5 oktober kii raat jile kii month thana police ke haathon ek yuvak ke encounter ko lekar raajnneeti tej ho gai he
 The police officer Dharmendra Singh Chauhan of Moth police was arrested for firing and robbing a car, Pushpendra Yadav, resident of Karaguwan village of Erch, but the family of the deceased rejected the police story of killing Pushpendra Yadav on the police itself is charged
 iske baad police par gambhir sawaal khadey hone ke saath raajnneeti bhi tej ho gai
 On 9 October, Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav reached the village of Pushpendra Yadav and accused the police of killing Pushpendra after he comforted the family
 akhilesh ne kaha, "ye kaisaa ramraj he jahaan bekasoor kaa encounter kiya jaar rahaa he?" vahiin police in sabhi aaropon ko khaarij kar pushpendra yadav ke puraane krime record ko saamne laakar use apradhi sabit karne kii chatapataahat main dikh rahi he
 Actually, Pushpendra Yadav was killed by the Police Station on 5 October
 jhaansi ke esaspi opi singh ke mutabik khanan kaarobaari pushpendra yadav ne 5 oktober ko kanpur se lautakar month thane ja rahe thanadhyaksh dharmendra singh chouhan par jaanaleva hamalaa kiya tha
 Dharmendra Singh was injured after being shot in, after which Pushpendra Yadav robbed his Creta car and ran away
 police ke mutabik, hamalaa isliye kiya gaya kyonki pushpendra yadav kaa ek trek police ne sij kiya tha
 The Jhansi police claim that the body was sent to her village after the post-mortem on Sunday
 lekin mritak bhai rabindra or parivaar ke logon ne shav kaa antim sanskaar karne se manaa kar diya
 After not receiving the dead body, the Jhansi Police issued a notice informing the police to perform the last rites in Jhansi Muktidham by making Munadi in the village
 iske baad police ne pushpendra kaa antim sanskaar kar diya
 After the funeral, there was further outrage among the people
 samaajawaadee party ne ise mudda banaakar virodh shuru kar diya he
 Akhilesh Yadav said that the encounter was not an encounter
 The police, the national president of the Hatayamajwadi Party, Akhilesh Yadav, reached the village of Karguwan to console Pushpendra Yadav's family
 akhilesh yadav ne kaha he, "yah encounter nahin he, police ne pushpendra yadav kii goli markar hatya kii he
 The police is making a false story of the encounter to cover up their crimes
 " akhilesh yadav ne kaha ki ye gandhi kaa desh he
 What kind of Ramraj is being run here? ye ramraj kaa bharosa dilaane vaale log desh kii aatma ko khatm kar rahe hai
 The family of the deceased Pushpendra has made serious allegations against the police, Shivangi Yadav, wife of Pushpendra Yadav, has accused the police of killing Pushpendra at the hands of the police for demanding money in lieu of holding the truck
 shivangi kahati hai, "month police lagaataar uske pati se paise le rahi thi
 After getting the truck caught, the husband gave one lakh rupees to the police
 iske baad bhi 50 hajaar rupye kii or maang kii ja rahi thi
 When Pushpendra asked for no money, he was shot and killed by the police
 "mritak ke bhai ravindra yadav kaa kahana he, police ke paas thanadhyaksh dharmendra singh dwaara paise lene ke sakshya the
 When the matter was disturbed, the police felt that she could get involved in it and they killed Pushpendra
 uskaa mobile bhi saath le gaye jisamen kai saboot the
 The family says that they will fight a legal battle until a murder case is registered against the station incharge
 is maamle par rajyasabha saansad dow
 Chandrapal Singh Yadav says, "the whole theory of the police is under question
" pushpendra koi apradhi nahin he
 The police was constantly taking money from him
 baat bigadi to uskaa encounter dikhaa diya
 Only after examining the call details of Pushpendra's mobile will many things be cleared, which the police are putting a curtain on
 "police par uth rahe hai ye sawalencounter kii ghatana ke paas police kii bhoomika par jo sawaal uth rahe hai unamem yah ki thanadhyaksh dharmendra singh chouhan kanpur chuttee se lautakar thane main charge lene ke pehle pushpendra yadav se milane kyon pahunche? unako milane ke liye kisne kol kiya tha or vah kyon vahaan sada vardi main gaye? yaheen par thanadhyaksh or pushpendra ke bich vivaad hua, jiske baad dharmendra singh ne aarope lagaaya ki unpar pushpendra ne goli chalaai jo unke kaan or gaal ko jakhmi karte hue nikal gai
 It was only after this that the police registered a case of murderous assault and robbing of the Creta car against Pushpendra at the Moth police station, and claimed to have killed Pushpendra in an encounter after combing only about four hours later
 iske baad shav ke postmortem main hui deree par bhi vah sawaalon ke ghere main he
 The family is also accused of not giving a post-mortem report yet
 *** Political alliances and the election season
 naaron ke bina beswad lagata he
 But the changing political equations also change the language of slogans
 jo kabhi ek duusare ke khilaaf naaraa lagaaya karte the, ab ve ek saath hai to sochiye, ab nayi dosti ke naye naare kaise honge
 The BSP, which once coined the slogan "ascend Gundan's chest, will seal on the elephant", is now with the SP and is fighting the 2019 elections together
 jaahir he ki is gathbandhan ke baad naaron kaa rang rup bhi badal jayega
 At the same time, the SP, which has given the slogan of "uttar Pradesh likes it," is now "disliked" by the Congress
 raajnneetik vishleshak vimal kishor ne ‘‘bhashaa'' se kaha, ‘‘mili mulaayam kanshiram, hawa ho gaye jayshriram'' 
 In 1993, when the SP and BSP contested the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, this slogan was quite popular, taking the BJP to the target
 ''unhone kaha, ''ab ek baar phir sapa-basapa saath hai lekin netritv badal gayi hai
 Instead of Mulayam, Akhilesh Yadav and Kanshi Ram are replaced by Mayawati

 In 2014, the BJP gave the slogan, "this time Modi government" which became the party's victory factor
 ‘‘jaat par na paat par, muhar lagegi haath par'',1996 ke loksabhaa chunaav main congress dwaara diya gaya ye naaraa khub gunja
 Folk artist Ashish Tiwari, who used slogans in music during election season to reach people with the help of loudspeakers, said, "no oil in this lamp, government formation is not a game

 Indira Gandhi gave this slogan in 1971

 The police have registered a case

 a local police officer said that 15-year-old Dalit Kishori lives with his family in the area
 guuruuvaar ko vah ghar par akele thi
 Meanwhile, a youth named Puneet, who lives in his neighborhood, suddenly entered his house and raped the teenager
 is dauraan ladki madad ke liye cheekhney lagi
 Hearing his voice, his ten-year-old brother came there to rescue him
 lekin aaropee punit ne uski pitayee kar di
 After committing the crime, the accused youth escaped from the spot
 peedita kii shikaayat par police nabalaatkaarmamala darj kar liya he
 So far Puneet has not been arrested
 police kaa kahana he ki jald hi aaropee ko giraftaar kar liya jayega
 It may be illegal to ride a bike in a cheap, non-isi-marked helmet, available for Rs 40 to 200 rupees, or sitting on the back of the bike, but an invoice has not been deducted even once in 9 years
 artiai ke jariye jaankaree hasil karne vaale ulhas piaar ne yah jaankaree dete hue kaha ki pichley 9 saalon main dilli trephic police ne non-isi helmet pahanane vaale kisi bhi biker kaa chaalaan nahin kiya he
 If someone agrees to wear a cheap helmet, then someone seeks another head to blame
 kanoon kaa dar sir ko khulaa to nahin rahane detaa, lekin naam ke aise helmet main sir surakshit bhi nahin rahata kyonki ye helmet saste hote hai par tikaoo nahin
 Without ISI marking, helmets can be found anywhere on the roadside pavement for anywhere from Rs 40-50 to Rs 100-200
 haalanki, sawaal yah he ki jab motor vikal act kahata he ki bike ke liye helmet kaa ISI mark kaa hona jaruri he
 Wearing a helmet is compulsory, so why is there no restriction on the sale of these roadside helmets and why the police do not cut the challan on its use is also a big question
 -50 rupye main milane vaale cap ko dekhakar dilli trephic police ko helmet kaa bhram ho saktaa he or aap 100 rupee ke chaalaan se batch bhi jaaenge, lekin yakeen maniye aisa helmet anchal yaa pallu se zyada nahin
 This helmet does not guarantee you protection from injury, but definitely saves you from police challan
 apni isi khaasiyat kii vajah se bazaar main saste helmet kii khaasi demand he or jab demand hogi to supplai bhi hogi or production bhi hoga
 Siddharth Chadha, the helmet seller at Delhi Gate, says that cheap helmets are also consumed
 50 fisadi hi log honge jinhen ISI mark vaala helmet chahie hota he
 The rest demand only cheap
 hamaare yahaan 40 rupee se lekar 2000 rupee tak kaa helmet he
 The comments darasal saste helmet ke production par koi roak nahin he kyonki beuro of indian standard kii mandetry list main helmet kaa zikr nahin he
 In such a situation, making non-isi helmets of substandard quality is not a legal offense, even if the motor vehicle act does not allow it to ride a bike
 lekin aapako bataa den ki agar aap saste helmet kaa istemaal karte hai to sar main chot aane par insurance clem nahin milegaa
 According to Delhi Police data, 2 lakh 48 thousand 357 people without helmets were challaned in 2014
 jabaki, is saal may tak 2 lakh 68 hajaar 585 logon kaa chaalaan kataa
 Helmets account for an average of 30 deaths each month
 pichley saal 1221 tu vilers kaa accident hua jisamen 247 logon kii maut hui jabaki 1179 log ghayal hue
 At the same time, the number of people who died in 2015 is 209 while 1268 people were injured
 ghatiya helmet pahanane par koi apni galati maan letaa he to koi dosha madhne ke liye koi or sir talash letaa he
 The fear of the law does not allow the head to remain open, but in such a helmet named the head is not safe because these helmets are cheap but not durable
 ISI marking ke bagaiyr vaale helmet sadak kinare footpath par aapako kahin bhi 40-50 rupye se lekar 100-200 rupye main mil jate hai
 However, the question is when the motor vehicle act states that the helmet must have the ISI mark for the bike
 helmet pahananaa anivaary he to phir in sadakchhaap helmet kii bikri par roak kyon nahin lagati or police iske istemaal par chaalaan kyon nahin katati, yah bhi ek digar sawaal he
 Seeing the cap of Rs
 50, Delhi Traffic Police may get the illusion of a helmet and you will also be saved from a challan of Rs
 100, but believe that such a helmet is no more than Aanchal or Pallu
 ye helmet aapako chot se bachaav kii guarantee nahin detaa lekin police ke chaalaan se jarur bachaa letaa he
 Because of this feature, there is a lot of demand for cheap helmets in the market and when there is demand, there will be supply and production
 dilli get par helmet ke vikreta siddharth chaddha bataate hai ki saste helmet kii bhi khapat he
 Only 50 percent of the people will need a helmet with ISI mark
 baaki to saste kii hi demand karte hai
 We have helmets ranging from Rs 40 to Rs 2000
 tippaniyan Actually, there is no restriction on the production of cheap helmets because the mandate list of Bureau of Indian Standards does not mention helmets
 aise main non-isi yani ghatiya quality ke helmet bananaa kanuunan jurm nahin, bhale hi motor vikal act ise pahanakar bike chalaane kii ijaajat na de
 But let us tell you that if you use a cheap helmet, then you will not get an insurance claim if your head is hurt
 dilli police ke aankadon ke mutabik, 2014 main bina helmet vaale 2 lakh 48 hajaar 357 logon kaa chaalaan hua
 Whereas, till May this year, challans of 2 lakh 68 thousand 585 people were cut

 Narayan Sai, the son of Asaram's rape accused, has got temporary bail of three weeks
 gujarat hai court ne unhen maa ke oparation ke liye somvaar ko jamaanat de di
 Sai will leave Surat Surat on Tuesday 
 haalanki jamaanat kii avadhi main vah apane kisi bhi ashram main nahin ja sakegaa
 If the operation is not done by 1 June, it will have to surrender
 gauratlab he ki 27 may ko sai kii maa lakshmiben kaa oparation hona he
 Earlier, on April 29, the Supreme Court rejected the bail plea of betanarayan Sai of Asaram in the rape case
 itnaa hi nahin, court ne saaf kar diya ki sai ko jamaanat tab milegi, jab uski maa kii surgery kaa din tay hoga
 The court said, "sai will be released only when the doctors prescribe in writing that Narayana Sai's mother is to have an operation on the date of birth
 'gauratlab he ki maa kii surgery ke liye sai ne jamaanat kii yachika daakhil kii thi, jis par sunwaayee karte hue gujarat hai court ne sai ko teen hafte ke liye jamaanat par reeha kar diya tha
 This order of the High Court was challenged by the government in the Supreme Court
 supreme court ne buudhvaar ko spasht kiya ki maa kii surgery ke baad sai ko waapas fouran sarender karnaa hoga
 Recently, Mahendra Chawla, the main witness in Narayan Sai's case, was shot dead in Panipat

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while replying to the discussion on the President's address to the Parliament, started the noise from the opposition benches as soon as he started speaking
 uske baad modi ne bolnaa shuru kiya
 Modi said, the parliamentary tradition of this house has been very high
 sadan main kaaphi anbhavi, teen-chaar dashak se raashtra ke sawaalon ko ujagar karne vaale, sulajhane vaale, lagaataar praytn karne vaale varisht mahanubhav bhi is sadan main virajman hai
 If a new person like me is saying something, if the dignity of the house is lacking in dignity, then as a new person you will forgive me
 aisa vishwaas he
 Read: Modi's full speech in Rajya Sabha More than 50 respected members of Lok Sabha have expressed their views on President's address
 maine sadan main rahete hue or kuch mere kamare main baithkar kareeb-kareeb sabhi bhaashan sune hai
 It is true that this voice has come that you have told so many things, how will you do it, when will you do it
 main maanata hum ki ek sahi vishay ko sparsh kiya he or ye man main aana bahut swaabhaavik he
 i tell my own experience
 nayaa nayaa gujarat main mukhyamantri banakar gaya tha
 Once in the House, i said that i want to provide 24-hour power to the village house of Gujarat
 satta paksh ne taaliyaan bajaain, vipaksh main sannata tha
 Chaudhary Amar Singh was the leader of our opposition
 congress ke varisht or sulajhe netaa
 Later came to meet with time
 bole modi ji kahin chook to nahin ho rahi
 You are new 24 ghante bijli kaise doge
 He expressed concern with a friendly gesture
 maine kaha
 This is my idea, we will
 vah bole kaise karoge
 It was natural for him to have this idea
 mujhe yakeen tha, or ye ho gaya
 Read: 10 facts about Modi's speech, so it is natural for senior dignitaries to have thoughts
 abhi tak nahin hua to kaise hoga
 But i assure the House that we will not take any pleasure in fulfilling the path presented by the President
 hamaare liye raashtrapati ji kaa abhibhaashan ye sirf parampara kaa hissaa nahin he
 Everything said through them to us holds the status of sacred bond
 use puraa karne kaa hamaara prayaas bhi he auki yahi baat hamaari prerana bhi ban sakati he
 Therefore, we must always give a dignity, also a seriousness, to the President's address for the time to come
 sadan main ham sabko milakar use purna karne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie
 When the voting took place, we were all candidates till the vote, but after coming to the House, we are the ambassadors of the public
 ham janata kii ummiido ke rakhwale hai
 Somebody's job has to be done
 agar koi kami rah jaati he to kuch kaa kaam us par ungali uthaanaa hoga, taaki kaam puure hon
 a small thick tip is necessary
 lekin mujhe sadan main puri tarah sakaaratmak vichaar najar aayaa
 Among the issues raised, there was hope
 is sansad main aap kahin bhi baithe hon, janata kii aashaa sabaki aawaaj main pratidhwanit hui he
 This is an auspicious sign for the fate of India
 So Sorry: modi kii paathshaala ne badla mantriyon kaa routinakai varshon ke baad desh ne sthir shashan ke liye, vikaas ke liye, sushasan ke liye mat dekar paanch saal ke liye vikaas kii yatra ko sunishchit kiya he
 This concern of the voters of India and their thinking, we have to fulfill the responsibility they have given us
 lekin ek baat hamen sochni hogi
 That India is a big democratic country in the world, we are mentioned in that form
 lekin kya samay kii maang nahin he ki vishwa ke saamne ham kitni badi loktantrit shakti hai
 How high are our traditions
 hamaare saamaanya se saamaanya vyakti ke man main loktantr ke prati kitni jaagrukta he
 Have we presented this power in the right form to the world
 is chunaav ke baad hamaara samuhik daayitv banataa he ki ham vishwa ko prabhavit karen
 There are as many voters in the whole of Europe and America
 usase zyada log chunaav main shariq hote hai
 Have we revealed this potential? ye sahi he ki kuch baton main 12 sau saal kii gulaami kii maansikta prabhavit karti he
 He dares to talk with his head elevated
 kabhi kabhi chamadi kaa rang bhi asar dikhaata he
 After being freed from all those things, now the strength of 125 crore people of India will be put in front of being presented in a powerful form before the world, eye to eye
 uskaa agenda ham rakhenge
 The poor of this country do not wish to be put to pieces, brothers and sisters, Honorable President, the nation, who has the first right on this
 sarkaar kiske liye honi chahie
 Should the government only be for educated people
 kya sarkaar sirf in gine logon ke laabh ke liye ho
 The government should be for the poor
 amir ko apane bachche ko padhaanaa ho, wo kisi bhi skool or teacher ko hair kar saktaa he
 If someone becomes ill, hundreds of doctors can come and stand here
 garib kahaan jaae
 There is a government school and hospital in his destiny
 isliye sarkaar kaa ye sabase pehla daayitv hota he ki ve garibon kii sunen or garibon ke liye jien
 If we do not run the government business for the poor
 garibon kii bhalaai ke liye nahin chalaate hai, to ye desh kii janata hamen kabhi maaf nahin karegi
 And so, Honorable Chairman, Madam
 is sarkaar kii pehali praathamikta he
 And we are people born in the ideals of Deendayalji
 jinhone antyoday kii baat kahi
 gandhi-lohia and Deendayalji, these three great men showed the only way to bring resources and help to the person sitting at the end of the society
 garib ke andar vah takat lani he, taaki vah jujh sake
 Education is the biggest tool for the fight against poverty
 andh shraddha se mukti
 If we are successful in bringing us out of illiteracy, then the poor of this country do not wish to fall on anyone's pieces
 vah apane balboote apni duniya banane ke liye taiyaar he
 We try to give hold of this fundamental strength
 agar sarkaar kii yojanaayen isamen madad karen
 All the arrangements of governance should be for the welfare of the person sitting at that end
 tab baat banegi
 Whether the city is of convenience, the village of Atma we have been listening for centuries
 bharat kisaanon kaa, gaanvon kaa desh he
 These slogans sound good
 par kya ham seene par haath rakh kah sakate hai ki ham inaki surat badal paae hai
 We have not stood for criticism of any government
 ye samuhik daayitv he ki ham use praathamikta den
 We tried to do that in the President's speech
 yahaan vishay aayaa, kaise karenge
 If given the convenience, the villages will contribute more in the development where the facility is of the city
 aatma gaanv kii ho
 The identity of the village remains in the soul of the village
 gaanv main baraat aati he to puure gaanv ko lagata he ki hamaara baraat ai he
 But what will keep the people of our village deprived of modern facilities
 main anubhav se kahata hum ki gaanv ko aadhunik suvidhadi jaae to vah desh ke vikaas main zyada yogadan denge
 If the village gets 24 hours electricity, internet connection, schooling
 ho saktaa he ki gaanv main uttam shikshak na ho
 But we can teach it very well through satellite, modern science through more capable teachers sitting in the city
 agar gaanv ke noujvaan ko rojgaar mil jaae to vah maa-baap ko chhodkar kyon jaae
 Those who are asking, how to do it, spread the industry in Jawabgaon, to become an agro based industry, if we accept this strength then the life of the village of the farmer can change
 sikkim chota sa rajya, kam aabaadi, magar mahatvapurn kaam kiya
 Every product of Sikkim region is going to be organic
 aaj puri duniya main holistic health care kii chintaa karne vaala varg he
 They are willing to pay for it
 sikkim ke kisaanon ne jo kiya, use puraa desh kar saktaa he
 Our concern is that we should help the entire North East emerge as an organic state, to help them capture the world market
 to kitna bada badlaav aa saktaa he
 We have so many agricultural universities
 research ho rahi he
 But the one who is in the lab is not in the land
 yah durbhaagya he
 We need to move to modern agriculture
 gujarat main hamane swil health card kaa kadam uthaaya
 The farmer came to know for which crop his land is healthy
 card banane se use pataa chalaa ki vah galat fasal paidaa kar rahaa tha, zyada urvarak istemaal karata tha
 When the card was created, it saved costs and increased production
 kya yah puure desh main lagu nahin ho saktaa
 Those who are asking how will do
 unhen bataa rahaa hum
 Our Agriculture University students go to the village on holiday
 puure hindustan main 10+2 ke college main lab hoti he, use swil test lab banaaya jaae
 During the holiday, do a test in the lab
 jo kamai hogi, usase krishi ke chaatro or skool donon ko phayda hoga
 Small experiments will have to be done
 railway kii aadat kya he
 The goods that came to Mande should last for a week
 mande ko marble aata he, tusde ko tamaato aata he
 Marble goes first, tomatoes later
 ham sensitive kyon nahin hai
 Evening stove should be burnt in the house of the poor
 Our IT field is recognized
 magar hamaare paas agro product kaa real time data nahin he
 Can't we create this data? hamane mahangaai dur karne kaa vaada kiya he
 We are committed to striving authentically
 isliye nahin ki ye sirf chunavi vaada he
 We think that the evening stove should be burnt in the poor's house
 garib ke bete shaam ko aansu pikar nahin soyenge
 There is no shortage of granary in the country
 vyavastha kii kami he
 Be real time data
 sarkaar ko pataa ho
 Where there is a shortage, it should be sent immediately
 usee hisaab se godaam bane
 The Food Corporation of India has been in operation for years
 uski vyavastha ko sudhaar diya jaae, to main daawey se kahata hum ki ham chizon ko badal sakate hai
 Research in pulses has not been done for years
 logon ko isi se protein miltaa he
 If the fight against malnutrition is to be fought, it will have to be worked on
 barason se ham dalhan main na to utpaadan main badhat le paaen hai, na hi iske poshak tatwon main
 This is a big challenge
 ham krishi vaigyanikon ko iske liye prerit karen
 'we will work hard on the barbaric events of Pune and UP' in our development journey to India, which is fifty taka population
 hamaari maa-bahanen hai, unhen aarthik unnati se jodna hoga
 We have to worry about their active participation, their respect and safety
 pichley dinon jo kuch ghatnaayen ghati hai
 We should not be in power
 pidaa karne vaali ghatana he
 Whether Pune is killed
 chaahe uttar pradesh kii hatya ho
 Let the market happen
 hamaari bahanon ke saath hue balaatkaar hon
 All these events lead to self-thinking
 sarkaar ko kathorta se kaam karnaa hoga
 The country will not wait
 hamaari apni aatma maaf nahin karegi
 i appeal to the politicians
 balaatkaar kii ghatnaon kaa manovaigyanik vishleshan karnaa band karen
 Does not suit us ham maa bahanon kii garima par khilwaad karte hai
 Which political level have they reached
 hamen is prakaar kii bayaanbaji karnaa shobhaa detaa he kya
 Can we not remain silent? or isliye nari kaa sammaan, nari kii suraksha, ye ham sabaki sava sau karod deshavaasiyon kii praathamikta honi chahie
 China is getting old, India is 65 percent of its population, under 35 years of age
 ham kitne saubhagyashaalee hai
 We are alive in that era, we are sitting in that Parliament, when India is the youngest country in the world
 demographic divijan, is takat ko ham pahachaanen
 The whole world needs skilled labor power
 hamaare pados main china boodha hota ja rahaa he, ham noujvaan hote ja rahe hai
 This is Advantage
 isliye duniya ke sabhi deshon kaa ek hi agenda rahata he, skill development
 This should also be our priority
 hamen shram ev jayate, ise charitaarth karnaa chahie
 'scam India has to become Skill India' has become an identity in our world, Scam India
 hamaare desh kii pahchaan hamen banani he, skill india kii
 And we will fulfill that dream
 ek alag mantralay banaakar
 Creating entrepreneurship and skill development
 hamaare yahaan poochhate hai, kya
 i had read Dada Dharmadhikari's book in my childhood
 mahatma gandhi or vinoba ji ke saath rahete the
 The young man went to take a job
 unhone poocha kya karte ho
 He said, i am a graduate
 dada ne poocha, kya aata he
 He said, i am a graduate
 dada ne phir poocha ki aata kya he
 He then said, i am a graduate
 ham is baat se anubhav kar sakate hai ki jindagi main guzaara karne ke liye haath main hunar hona chahie, sirf degree se kaam nahin chalegaa
 Skill development will have to be done, its social status will also have to be made
 'musalamaanon kii sthiti main nahin hua koi badlaav'gaanv kaa baccha garibi ke chalate saatvin ke baad skool chhod detaa he
 Learns skills magar samaaj baad main bhi kahata rahata he, acha saatvin paas ho
 We left his skill work with a degree
 itiai ke do saal ke diploma ko dasvin ke baraabar bana diya
 Today, India can give maths and science teachers to the world
 vyapaaree baahar jayega to puunji laaegaa
 If the teacher goes out then he will bring the whole generation
 dalit ho, peedit ho, shoshit-vanchit ho
 Forest dwellers are siblings
 main ye nahin kah rahaa ki pehle kii sarkaar main gambhirtha nahin thi
 But the reality is that their circumstances have not changed
 kya ham puraane dharre se baahar aane ko taiyaar hai
 My Muslim brother
 jab main chota tha, dekhtaa tha cycle repere kar rahe hai
 Today his third generation is also doing the same thing
 isamen badlaav ke liye hamen focusd activity kerani hogi
 In this i see it as a change, not an appeasement
 koi bhi sharir, agar ek bhi ang viklang ho, to sharir swasth nahin ho saktaa
 If it remains weak, the society cannot remain strong
 or ham har kamjor tabake ke vikaas ke liye patibaddh hai
 'take inspiration from Gandhi's independence movement', we have to go towards a new definition of development
 desh main aazaadee kii ladaai 1200 saal ke kalkhand main koi varsh aisa nahin gaya, jab rajdhani ke liye maaramaari na ho
 After 1857, the whole country was struggling
 silsilaa chalata rahaa
 The process of sacrifice for the country continued
 andaman kii jail bhari padi thi
 But this was a great contribution of Mahatma Gandhi, which history has to accept
 aazaadee ke liye marane kii lalak rakhane waalon kii sankhya apaar hone ke baad bhi ye gandhi ji the, jinhone aazaadee ko jan andolan bana diya
 Some used to sweep, some used to spin yarn, some taught someone and everyone said that i am working for freedom
 ise angrej nahin samaj paae
 Gandhiji made the freedom movement a mass movement
 ham unase seekhen
 Take inspiration hamen vikaas ko bhi jan andolan bananaa chahie
 If we make it a government program, then it will be the same as what happened to those who fought for independence
 'har naagarik samajhe apni jimmedaari'desh main har kisi ko laganaa chahie ki main mere desh ke liye kar rahaa hum
 Farmers, laborers working in the field, teachers teaching, everyone thinks, i am doing for my country
 agar main raste par kooda bhi nahin phenkata
 i go to work on time to ye sab bhi desh kii seva he
 In a cricket field, the whole country can stand saying Bharat Mata ki Jai
 to desh ke vikaas ke liye bhi khadaa ho saktaa he
 After five years, 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary are going to happen
 kya ham ye sankalp nahin le sakate
 Gandhiji loved cleanliness
 sabarmati ashram kii ghatnaayen hamane suni padhi hai
 Can we put a clean India at the feet of Mahatma Gandhi on the 150th birth anniversary
 2022 main desh kii aazaadee ke 75 saal puure honge
 How many people spent their youth? kitne log faansee ke takht par chadh gaye
 Should we keep the next 5-8 years as a center of inspiration to celebrate 75 years of independence as a festival? main aazaadee ke baad paidaa hua
 Thoughts come to my mind
 mujhe desh ke liye marane kaa mauka nahin mila
 But there is a chance to live for the country
 'mulaayam ji aapkaa maargdarshan mili'agar mulaayam singh ji ne kaha ki unhone sarkaar chalaai he, jo main karnaa chahta hum
 How will he do 0
 unki sadbhaavna ke liye main unka abhaari hum
 But if we have dreamed, we will fulfill it
 kathinaayee aegi to aap jaise anbhavi logon kaa maargdarshan milegaa
 Someone said that our policies are old wine in a new bottle
 unako sharaab yaad aana, bada swaabhaavik he
 But also said that brother these are our talks, you have kept them up and down
 koi nai baat nahin hai
 You also know what we mean by this
 ek baar duryodhana ko poocha gaya ki ye dharm adharm kii samaj he yaa nahin
 So he said that i know religion, but not my instinct
 satya kya he, acha kya he, mujhe maaloom he
 But it is not in my DNA
 'har party ke varisht netaa kaa aashirwad lenge'mahabharat kaal puraa ho chukaa he
 Neither the Pandavas are left nor the Kauravas are left
 magar janamanas main hameshaa pandavon kii vijay kaa hi bhav rahaa he
 Vijay teaches us
 hamen siikhnaa bhi chahie
 i give confidence to this House
 hamaare yahaan jo seniors hai, kisi bhi dal ke kyon na hon
 With his blessings, we will receive the strength that saves us from darkness
 har pal namrata sikhaye
 Whatever be the number
 hamen aapke bagaiyr aage nahin badhanaa he
 We have to adopt the spirit of collectivity
 in dinon model kii charchaa hoti he
 Gujarat model
 mere bhaashan sune honge
 Gujarat model: In Gujarat also the model of one district does not run in another district
 desh vividhtaon se bharaa he
 How would Gujarat progress if the Kutch desert model were to be planted in the lush green area of valsad
 'gujarat kii badaulat shuru hui vikaas model kii charchaa'gujarat kaa doosraa model ye he ki hindustan ke kisi bhi kone main acha ho, use ham seekhen
 accept
 aane vaale dinon main ham use lekar aage badhanaa chaahate hai
 We will go ahead with what is good for everyone
 kal tamilnadu kii taraf se bolaa gaya
 Our model is better than Gujarat
 main swaagat karata hum
 At least talk and comparison of the development model started
 pehle ye nahin hota tha
 This is the biggest contribution of the Gujarat model
 ye sunne ke liye mere kaan taras rahe hai ki gujarat peeche rah gaya, ham aage nikal gaye
 This is the competition
 chote rajya bhi bahut acha kaam kar rahe hai
 Chhattisgarh, a state living under the shadow of Maoism
 unhone peedies kaa kya model banaaya he
 Sister Mamta ji is trying so hard to bring the state out of the evil of 34 years
 kerala se bhi
 From there, i called a junior officer
 ham sab student kii tarah baithe, unhone do ghante kutumb shri yojana sikhaai
 Officers came from Nagaland
 vahaan kii ek tribal yojana kii hamen baarikiyaan sikhain
 Want it 'loktantr main aarope bure, aalochana nahin'ye bade bhai kaa vyavhaar nahin chalegaa
 Together we will take the country forward
 isiilie hamane sahakaarita ke sanghathan kii baat kahi
 i am sure, Honorable President, Madam
 kul milakar main kah saktaa hum ki sarthak or samarthan main charchaa rahi he
 There has also been criticism, in terms of expectation
 main iskaa swaagat karata hum
 There have been good suggestions from any bench and party
 main unako aalochana nahin, maardarshak maangata hum
 In a democracy, allegations are bad, criticism gives strength
 aaj nae sadan main mujhe apni baat kehane kaa avasar mila
 Somewhere a word has gone here and there
 niyamon ke bandhan main kami rah gai ho
 i would like to say sorry ham matdaan ke pehle ummidavaar the
 Now there are messengers and keepers of hope
 aap sabhi kaa bahut bahut dhanyavad he

 After this, Hardik Pandya was declared as a Natout

 The Chief Minister accused the opposition of trying to tarnish the image of Jharkhand by misleading the people
 aakhir kya vajah he jharkhand main in mauton kii? kya in mauton kii vajah garibon ke rashan card radd hona he jisaki vajah se unhen saste anaaj se vanchit hona padaa

 ‘aaj tak’kii team ne in sawaalon ke jawaab jaanane kii koshish kii
 Whether ration cards are available with rural people in different areas? And if they have a ration card, are they getting ration or not? Also, what is the status of their ration card being linked to the Aadhaar card? Let us tell you that there have been allegations from many areas that where the ration card is not linked to Aadhaar, that is, giving ration to the villagers who do not have the Aadhar card
 Refusing to

 Some have the card but for the last two months, food is not available from the ration shop

 The ration seller says that finger prints are not available, so bring the mother first then only she will get ration
 ekka kaa kahana he ki aise halaat main use samaj nahin aa rahaa ki kya kare? kya khaakar pet bhare? isi gaanv kii mahila shukaro kaa dard he ki rashan card to he lekin wo aadhaar se link nahin he, isliye use anaaj nahin mil paa rahaa

 PM Modi also took a dig at the leaders of the grand alliance by tweeting Lohia's birth anniversary on Saturday
 vahiin, rajd ke rashtriya upaadhyaksh shivanand tiwari ne bhi is maukey par apni baat rakhi
 He also wrote a Facebook post in this regard
 unhone likhaa ki agar aaj lohia hote to pradhanmantri narendra modi ko satta se bedagal karne ke liye vipakshi dalon ko ek jute kar rahe hote
 Shivanand Tiwari wrote in his post that Lohia believed that democracy is at risk due to the Congress monopoly on the country's politics
 loktantr ko bachaane ke liye unhone gair kangresavad kaa abhiyaan shuru kiya tha
 non-congressism was his strategy
 uskaa ek khaas sandarbh tha
 Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay of the Jana Sangh and Comrade Bhupesh Gupta of the Communist Party were active partners in his strategy of non-congressism
 tab ke sandarbh main vah ek safal ranneeti thi
 The result of that strategy was that for the first time after independence, non-congress governments were formed in more than half a dozen states
 congress kii aparaajayta kii dharna tuuti
 Shivanand further wrote that as the name itself suggests, the purpose of any strategy is immediate
 iske ulat niti sthai yaa lambey samay ke liye hoti he
 If Lohia had been today and even today would have been giving the slogan of non-congressism, people would have ridiculed him
 desh kii raajnneeti main congress kii aaj kii haalat ko dayaneey hi kaha ja saktaa he
 Today in the Lok Sabha, it is not even recognized by the opposing party
 lohia ke vichaaron or nitiyon kii thodi bhi samaj rakhane vaala vyakti shivanand tiwari ke anusaar yah sahaj anumaan laga saktaa he ki aaj agar ve hote to narendra modi kii sarkaar ko satta se apdast karne ke liye sampurna vipaksh ko golband karne kii disha main baichaiyn rahete
 Democracy and the constitution are in danger today
 pichley paanch varshon main kattarwad majboot hua he
 Due to the radical policies of the Modi government, there is great unrest on the country's border
 chaahe vah pakistan se laga kashmir ho yaa china se laga uttar purv ke rajya hon
 a government which creates fear and doubt in the minds of its citizens living on the borders of the country cannot be called a worthy government
 aaj agar lohia hote to kehete ki aisi nalayaq sarkaar ko satta se bedagal karnaa hi aaj kaa raajnneetik dharm he
 Regarding the dress of Pandit Nehru's sherwani and tight pajamas, Lohia used to say that the Tabalchi of the Mughal court wore such a dress
 narendra modi ke sajadhaj ke vishay main lohia kya kehete ! modi raaj main jis tarah ashishnutaa badi he vah to bhayanak he
 There is a danger in speaking against Modi
 media jis tarah aaj sashtaang he use dekhte hue kaise kaha ja saktaa he ham loktantric desh he ! desh main swasth loktantr kii sthapana ke makasad se congress ko satta se hataane ke liye lohia ne gaiyrcongress vaad kii ranneeti banaai thi
 Had Lohia been today, he would have been active with restlessness towards making a policy from the road to the Parliament to protect the Modi government from the country's power to save democracy from the religious fundamentalist policies of the Modi government
 lohia kii raajnneeti main ladaakupan tha
 , Was aggressive
 lohia aaj hote to modi sarkaar kii nitiyon ke viruddh apane sahyogiyon ke saath sangharsh karte hue lathi khaakar kisi jail me band hote

 Freedom fighter Shaheed Bhagat Singh was hanged in connection with the murder of an English police officer
 faansee par latakaane ke 86 saal baad unhen begunaah sabit karne ke liye ek pakistani vakil lahore ucch nyaayalay main kanoonee ladaai lard rahe hai
 Advocate Imtiaz Rashid Qureshi filed an application and urged for early hearing on the petition
 lahore ucch nyaayalay kii khandpeeth ne farvari main mukhya nyaayadhish se aagrah kiya tha ki kuraishi dwaara daayar yachika par sunwaayee ke liye badi peeth kaa gathan kiya jaae, lekin ab tak koi karrwai nahin kii gai
 Please tell that Qureshi runs Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation in Lahore
 kya tha yachika main?yachika main kuraishi ne kaha tha ki bhagat singh ek swatantraaa senaanee the
 Who fought for the independence of undivided India
 bahut saare pakistani khaskar punjabi bhashi lahore kshetra main rahane vaale log bhagat singh ko nayak maanate hai
 Even today, he said that Bhagat Singh is respected by not only Sikhs but also Muslims in the Indian subcontinent
 yahaan tak ki pakistan ke sansthaapak mohammad ali jinna ne bhi do baar unhen shradhanjali arpit kii thi
 He said, 'it is a matter of national importance
 ' yachika main adaalat se punarvichaar ke siddhanton kaa paalan karte hue bhagat singh kii sajaa radd karne or sarkaar ko unhen rajkeey sammaan dene kaa aadesh dene kii maang kii gayi he
 Due to this hanging, Parbhagat Singh was hanged on 23 March 1931 at the age of 23 by the British rulers
 un par aarope tha ki unhone britain kii aupniveshik sarkaar ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi thi
 In this connection, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru were booked for allegedly killing the British police officer John P
 Sanders
 nyaayalay main yachika daayrakuraishi ne kaha, 'bhagat singh maamle par jald sunwaayee ke liye maine lahore ucch nyaayalay main yachika daayar kii he
 i urged the Registrar to fix the date of hearing of the case and hope to hear the case this month
 ' unhone kaha ki sangheey sarkaar ko patr likhakar shadaman chowk (lahore ke mukhya hisse) par bhagat singh kii pratimaa lagane kii maang kii gai he jahaan unhen unke do saathiyon ke saath faansee par latakaaya gaya tha
 The BJP accused the Congress of trying to hide the facts of the alleged disproportionate assets case of Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi
 party pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne kaha, ‘har aarope kii jaanch honi chahie
 If the government has even a little credibility left, it should immediately order an inquiry into the Vadra case to maintain it
 wadra kaa bachaav nahin kiijie
 Get the matter investigated
 ’wadra kaa bachaav karne vaale congress se jude kendriya mantriyon kii aalochana karte hue unhone kaha, 'congress jaanch se kataraa rahi he
 Today a minister has said that there should be no investigation against Vadra

 According to Hindu culture, Kharmas expire after 14 January and the auspicious moment begins for everyone
 aise main bhartiya cricket team mangalvaar ko england ke saath khelte hue apane kharaab daur ko peeche chhod kar 'shubh vakt' main jeet ke safar kaa shubharambh karnaa chaahegi
 The Indian team is trailing 0–1 in the five-match ODI series
 kochi main vah jeet ke saath nai shuruyaat kar paaegi yaa nahin, yah to vakt hi batayega lekin beetaa ek maheenaa bharat ke liye behad kharaab rahaa he
 He lost in the Test series to England and then lost the ODI series to Pakistan
 rajkot main bharat ne 326 ranon ke vishaal lakshya kaa peechha karte hue 316 ran banaae the
 The match was important in many respects
 bade lakshya kaa peechha karte hue jeet ke itane kareeb pahunchakar usase maharoom rah janaa kharaab vakt kii ore ishaara karata he
 Now that Kharmas has passed, India faces new challenges
 use austrailia ke saath hone vaali gharelu test shrinkhalaa se pehle khud ko sambhaalanaa hoga or iske liye use english team par jeet hasil kerani hogi
 Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will have to avoid the mistakes he made in Rajkot
 shandaar farm main chal rahe cheteshwar pujaara ko antim ekadash main shaamil nahin karnaa dhauni ke liye aalochana kaa kaaran bana tha
 Dhoni could have included Pujara in the squad in place of Ravindra Jadeja but Jadeja, who performed all-round against Pakistan in the last match, got the captain's confidence and thus India had to go without a good in-form batsman
 
 dhoni ke liye yah vakt kharaab he
 There was a time when everything he used to touch would become gold, but today things have changed
 ek vakt aisa tha, jab dhauni ke galat faisle bhi sahi sabit ho jaaya karte the lekin aaj unke kai sahi faisle bhi galat sabit ho jaaya karte hai
 In such a situation, Dhoni should intentionally inspire his teammates to play well while avoiding any stubbornness or mistake
 yah team ke liye zyada jaruri he kyonki sachin tendulkar or virendra sahvaag ke bagaiyr team vaise bhi kamjor padati dikhaai de rahi he
 Moreover, the openers have not been able to give a good start on one occasion since last year
 team main pradarshan ke santulan kaa abhaav he
 That is why when bowlers do well, the batsmen flop and when the batsmen shine, the bowlers spoil the work
 rajkot main england ke teen ballebaajon ne 100 se adhik ausat se ran banaae the or bharat ke chaar ballebaaj isse adhik ausat se banane main safal rahe the lekin iske baavjood team haar gai thi
 The reason is simple, Indian batsmen will have to stay on the wicket for some more time
 yahi haal gendbaajon kaa he
 Ishant Sharma bowled brilliantly in the third match against Pakistan in Delhi but his 10-over quota at Rajkot scored 86 runs
 strike gendbaaj hone ke naate ishanth ko apane pradarshan main nirantarata lani hogi
 On the other hand, the English team has very few concerns with India
 uske ballebaaj acchhee lay main hai or gendbaaj bakhubi apana kaam kar rahe hai
 Despite losing two practice matches before the one-day series, the English team did not let their impact come on their performance
 captain elister cook dwaara ian bel ko salaami ballebaaj ke taur par aajmaana team ke liye nai urja ke sanchaar kaa kaaran bana he
 Since two practice matches, Bell has scored a century and two half-centuries so far
 eon morgan, craig keeswaitor or kevin petersan ke rup main uske paas achche or farm main chal rahe ballebaaj hai, jo behad tej gati se ran banane kii kshamta rakhte hai
 They have all proved this in Rajkot
 kochi kii pich kya gul khilaaegi yah kahana mushkil he lekin itnaa jarur he ki english team bharat main beeti do shrinkhalaaon main mili 5-0, 5-0 kii haar kaa hisaab baraabar karne ko utaaru he or bharat ke in halaaton main use roak paanaa behad mushkil hoga

 Expressing objections to Sadhvi's statement on the martyr Hemant Karkare, Congress candidate from Bhopal and senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh said, "hemant Karkare was a dedicated officer who sacrificed for the security of the country and we are proud of his martyrdom

 "how was the test done?" Between July and October, in 2019, cse's Environmental Monitoring Lab tested the packaged and fast food ingredients of 33 well-known Indian and global multinationals
 iske liye association of oficial analitical chemists (eoesi) ke jariye soochibaddh antarrashtriya maanakon par sweekrut jaanch vidhiyon kaa upyog kiya gaya
 The association has not yet listed the carbohydrate test method, hence the globally adopted kalerametry method has been used

 This quantity is equal to the quantity served on the packet

 According to RDA, 5 grams of salt per day, fat 60 grams, trans fat 2 for a healthy person
 2 gram or 300 gram carbohydrate kii maatra tay kii gai he
 This calculation was done on the basis of 2,000 calories required for a healthy person daily
 din main teen baar bhojan or do baar naashte ke hisaab se bhi is maatra ko tay kiya gaya
 Consumption of these nutrients in our food should be less than 25% of the RDA
 din main do baar liye jane vaale mukhya naashte main ardie ke tay maanak kaa 10 fisadi se zyada isamen maujuud nahin hona chahie

 People are commonly seen talking about the negative effects of smartphone use, but recently researchers have found something that teenagers spend time on their phones or online is not as bad for mental health
 north carolina vishvavidhyalay main assistant professor micalin jension ne kaha he, "aam dharna ke vipareet ki smartphone or soshal media yuvak-yuvatiyon ke maansik swasthya par nakaaratmak prabhaav daal rahaa he, ham is vichaar ke liye zyada saport nahin dekh rahe hai ki phone or online bitaye gaye vakt kaa sambandh maansik swasthya samasyaon ke bade jokhim se he
 "for a study published in the journal Clinical Psychological Science, researchers tested over 2,000 teenagers between the age group of 10 to 15 years

 When these reports were subsequently looked at, researchers found that excessive use of digital technology was not related to poor mental health
 shodhakartaaon ne kaha ki report main jin yuvaaon ke adhik text massej bhejne kii soochna mili ve un yuvaaon kii tulana main acha mahasoos kar rahe the jinhone kam massej bheja
