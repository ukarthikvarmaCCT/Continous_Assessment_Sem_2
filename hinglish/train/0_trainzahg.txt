 yah unka record pradarshan tha or iske jariye unhone naa keval apane pichley record 75
 47 meters improved but rather Commonwealth Games qualification standard 77
 29 meter ko paar kar liya
 For Khaira, it is like a dream come true
 unhone kaha, 'jab maine taxi driver ke rup main shuruyaat kii thi, to koi bhi mujhe is khel main mauka nahin dena chahta tha
 Only to qualify for the Commonwealth Games, i am very happy with my achievements

 Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will undertake another visit
 is baar unki ' nishchay yatra ' hogi
 Actually, since Nitish closed the Janata Durbar, he was promising a visit to the public
 nitish ne shuukravaar ko aakhirkaar patna main is yatra kaa elaan kar diya
 As part of this visit, he will once again visit the district headquarters
 nitish yatra ke dauraan har jagah saat nishchay se sambandhit pragati kii samiksha karenge or janata kii shikayaton ke niptaare kaa prayaas karenge
 Talking about this entire program, Nitish said that there have been seven surety call centers in the districts
 vahaan jaakar bhi unka nirikshan unki is yatra ke agenda main shaamil he
 The comments nitish kumaar varsh 2005 main mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar bane the
 It was then that he first started with the Nyaya Yatra
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad ve vikaas yatra, dhanyavad yatra, pravaas yatra, seva yatra, sankalp yatra ke tahat rajya ke logon kii shikaayatein sun chuke hai
 In every journey, Nitish tries to deal with the problems of more and more people of the state
 nitish ne kaha ki patna main unka man nahin lagata
 He conceded that nothing can be done only by making plans and till the land is reviewed, no program can be successful
 haalanki jab nitish kumaar mukhyamantri nahin the tab party ke liye nikaali gai ek yatra main anubandhit shikshakon ne jamkar virodh kiya tha
 For this reason, after becoming Chief Minister, he increased the salaries of teachers on priority
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki mahagathbandhan ko iskaa laabh bhi mila
 During the journey, Nitish will review the progress related to the seven convictions everywhere and will try to resolve the public grievances
 is puure kaarykram kii charchaa karte hue nitish ne kaha ki jilo main saat nishchay se sambandhit kol centre bane hai
 Even going there, his inspection is on the agenda of his visit
 tippaniyan Nitish Kumar became the chief ministerial candidate in 2005
 tab unhone sabase pehle nyaay yatra se shuruyaat kii thi
 After becoming Chief Minister, he has heard the complaints of the people of the state under Vikas Yatra, Thanksgiving Yatra, Migration Yatra, Seva Yatra, Sankalp Yatra
 har yatra main nitish kii koshish hoti he ki rajya ke zyada se zyada logon kii samasyaon se rubaru ho saken
 Nitish said that he does not feel like in Patna
 unhone mana ki keval yojana bana lene se kuch nahin hota jab tak jameen par jaakar uski samiksha na kii jaae tab tak koi bhi kaarykram safal nahin ho saktaa
 However, when Nitish Kumar was not the chief minister, the contract teachers protested in a yatra for the party
 is kaaran mukhyamantri banane ke baad unhone praathamikta se shikshakon ke vetan badaye
 Experts believe that the grand alliance also benefited from this
 nitish kumaar varsh 2005 main mukhyamantri pad ke daavedaar bane the
 It was then that he first started with the Nyaya Yatra
 mukhyamantri banane ke baad ve vikaas yatra, dhanyavad yatra, pravaas yatra, seva yatra, sankalp yatra ke tahat rajya ke logon kii shikaayatein sun chuke hai
 In every journey, Nitish tries to deal with the problems of more and more people of the state
 nitish ne kaha ki patna main unka man nahin lagata
 He conceded that nothing can be done only by making plans and till the land is reviewed, no program can be successful
 haalanki jab nitish kumaar mukhyamantri nahin the tab party ke liye nikaali gai ek yatra main anubandhit shikshakon ne jamkar virodh kiya tha
 For this reason, after becoming Chief Minister, he increased the salaries of teachers on priority
 jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki mahagathbandhan ko iskaa laabh bhi mila
 Nitish said that he does not feel like in Patna
 unhone mana ki keval yojana bana lene se kuch nahin hota jab tak jameen par jaakar uski samiksha na kii jaae tab tak koi bhi kaarykram safal nahin ho saktaa
 However, when Nitish Kumar was not the chief minister, the contract teachers protested in a yatra for the party
 is kaaran mukhyamantri banane ke baad unhone praathamikta se shikshakon ke vetan badaye
 Experts believe that the grand alliance also benefited from this

 This means that atms or credit cards with magnetic stripes will become worthless from 1 January
 bataa den ki vartmaan main desh main magnetic strip or EMV chip do tarah ke debit or credit card chalan main hai
 Not right for security, according to RBI, magnetic stripe card is not considered right for security
 aise main bainkon ne EMV chip vaale atm yaa credit card dena shuru kar diya he
 In such a situation, if you also have a magnetic striped card, then replace it with a card with a chip
 iske liye bainkon kii ore se aapse koi shulk nahin liya jayega

 Conversely, non-cts checks cannot be read by the computer

 So, clearance also takes a lot of time

 a total of 8 petitions related to Jammu and Kashmir were heard in the Supreme Court on Monday
 congress netaa or purv kendriya mantri gulam nabi azaad kii yachika par sunwaayee ke dauraan congress netaa ke vakil abhishek manu singhvi ne daleel rakhi
 The Supreme Court has allowed Ghulam Nabi Azad to visit Kashmir, during which he can visit four districts
 is dauraan vah koi raajnneetik kaarykram main hissaa nahin le paaenge
 Once there, he will submit a report to the Supreme Court
 is bare main centre ko notice diya gaya he
 After the Supreme Court's approval, now Ghulam Nabi Azad can visit the districts of Baramulla, Anantnag, Srinagar and Jammu
 gulam nabi aaazaad kii taraf se adaalat ko bharosa dilaayaa gaya he ki is dauraan vah koi raily nahin karenge
 During the hearing on Monday, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, on behalf of Ghulam Nabi Azad, said in court that Ghulam Nabi Azad is a six-time MP, former Chief Minister, yet was repatriated from Srinagar Airport
 gulam nabi aaazaad ne 8, 20 or 24 agast ko waapas jane kii koshish kii
 Significantly, Ghulam Nabi Azad had filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking permission to meet his family
 aapako bataa den ki 5 agast ko centre sarkaar ne jammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataane kaa faisla liya tha
 Since then, no outside leader was allowed to enter the valley
 pehle gulam nabi aaazaad jab gaye the to unhen srinagar airport se waapas bhej diya tha, iske baad vah rahul gandhi or anya vipakshi netaaon ke saath srinagar gaye the
 Even then he was deported from Srinagar Airport

 The first incident is the budget of the state government, which is the second budget of the current term of Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 duusari ghatana thik us vanchat ghati, jab raaje bajet pesh karne ja rahi thim
 This incident was lathi charge on the protesting Congressmen, in which State Congress Committee President Sachin Pilot and Youth Congress President and MLA Ashok were injured

 The lathi charge proved that after years the state Congress has found a leader who can lead without fear of lathis
 payalat aise tej-tarraar netaa ke rup main ubhare hai, jo rajya main gum-ghumkar party ke kaaryakartaaon se mil rahaa he

 a better change than previous leaders like Joshi and Chandrabhan, who were afraid to lead demonstrations and agitations and remained confined to the politics of press releases
 congress vidhayak dal ne rajyapal ke abhibhaashan par dhanyavad prastaav par hui bahes ke ant main raaje ke jawaab kaa or unke bajet bhaashan kaa bhi bahishkaar kar diya, natijatan aath vidhayakon ko sadan se nishkasana bhi jhelana padaa
 But Pilot, who took command of the dead Congress in this way, proved that he can still create a storm, despite not having a single MP and MLA without counting
 haalanki unki is ranneeti ke chalate vidhayak sadan main sattarudh party kaa virodh karne kaa mauka ganvaa rahe hai
 But it is not so important
 vipaksh main rahete hue gahalot ne kabhi sadan kii kaarywahi main hissaa nahin liya phir bhi ve mukhyamantri ban gaye
 The pilots are targeting Raje's mistakes, while Gehlot used to attack unfairly, many of whom targeted Lalit Modi
 gahalot kii tarah raaje bhi dhan kii kami kaa ronaa ro rahi hai, faislon or vikaas kaaryon ko anischitkaal ke liye taal rahi hai, jabaki apane duusare kaarykaal main gahalot ne dhan kii kami kii shikaayat kiye bagaiyr jamini str par kaam shuru kar diya tha
 However, he failed due to bad officers
 raaje bhi aise afasaron par bharosa kar rahi hai, jo gahalot ke prati vafadari ke liye jane jate hai yaa jo kharaab nateezon ke dar se saahsee faisle lene se kataraate hai
 She had brought some officers from the Center who had no idea of the political atmosphere of revenge actions during the Congress rule
 ve waapas bhi chale gaye
 Its results have been seen on both the budget and the government
 raaje ke duusare bajet main unke pichley bajet kii tulana main kuch nayaa nahin he
 Their emphasis on time-bound projects seems to be a thing of the past
 beete 15 maah main die gaye antaheen pregetension ke baavjood koi amal nahin dikhataa
 Now they have tried to change their focus
 unhone karon ko viveksangat banaaya he or vittiya prabandhan tathaa rajkaaj ke kaam ko aasaan banane ke liye soochna takanic ke istemaal par jor de rahi hai
 They are hoping to gain private sector participation for infrastructure transformation
 lekin jaankaar kehete hai ki buniyadi dhaanche par unke salaahkaar saarvajanik-nijee bhagidaari ke liye dastavej taiyaar karne main itnaa lanbaa vanchat laga rahe hai ki visheshgyata ke baavjood deree kii vajah se iskaa koi phayda hone vaala nahin he
 Even at the grassroots level, this time does not see all the work for which she was known in the previous term: she made good roads and good waste disposal in the cities
 rajya kii mali haalat utani buree nahin he, jitani bataai ja rahi he
 Therefore, it seems that in the third year of his power, he intends to make full use of the resources he has kept so far
 janata bhi unhen har ek chunaav main jitakar unke manamafik vakt de rahi he
 Raje says, "now the time has come for us to work

 It struggled since childhood

 The good thing is that 'samayantar' edited by him is not a symptom

 vodaphone idia ko duusari timahi main bhartiya corporate itihaas kaa sabase zyada 50,921 karod rupee kaa bada ghaataa hua he
 Similarly, Airtel has also incurred a huge loss of Rs 23,045 crore
 aakhir kya he yah masalaa, kyon isse tabah ho rahi hai telecom companiyaan? aaie ise samajhate hai
 What happens AGR Adjusted gross revenue (AGR) is the usage and licensing fees charged by telecom companies by the Department of Telecommunications (dot) in the Ministry of Communications
 iske do hisse hote hai- spectrum ujes charge or licencing fees, jo kramash 3-5 fisadi or 8 fisadi hota he
 What is in dispute? In fact, the Department of Telecommunications states that AGR should be calculated based on the total revenue or revenue of a telecom company, including income from non-telecom sources such as deposit interest and asset sales
 duusari taraf, telecom companiyon kaa kahana he ki AGR kii gananaa sirf telecom sevaaon se hone vaali aay ke aadhaar par honi chahie
 In 2005, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) challenged the government definition of AGR calculations, but then the Telecom Disputes Resolution and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) recognized the government's stand as legitimate and allowed all types of receipts in companies' earnings
 Was considered to be involved
 iske baad telecom companiyon ne ise supreme court main chunauti di
 The Supreme Court in its order dated October 24, 2019 also upheld the stand of the Department of Telecommunications and empowered the government to recover the outstanding adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of about Rs 94,000 crore from the telecom companies
 byaaj or jurmaane ke saath yah kareeb 1
 3 lakh crores becomes Rs
 court ne telecom companiyon se teen maheene ke bheetar yah bakaayaa raashi jamaa karne ko kaha
 Vodafone Idea is hitting its worst and experts say that these companies can also go bankrupt if the government does not give them some relief
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ko kam se kam byaaj or jurmaana to maaf kar hi dena chahie
 Telecom companies are considering filing a review petition in the Supreme Court for this order
 iske liye aadesh ke ek maheene ke bheetar yani 24 november tak hi yachika daakhil kii ja sakati he
 The biggest burden on Airtel and vodafone-idea will be to pay Rs 43,000 crore to Airtel and Rs 40,000 crore to Vodafone Idea
 iske liye antim tithi 24 janvari he
 The committee of secretaries of the government is also considering how companies can be relieved
 yahi nahin, PGCIL, railtel, sabhi internet sarvice prowider, prasar bharti, satellite communication prowider or cabel oparator sahit 40 anya license dharak bhi supreme court dwaara tay AGR kii paribhaasha main aaenge
 However, how this charge will be taken from non-telecom companies is being considered
 barbaad ho rahi companiyandesh main jeeyo kii chunauti or anya kai vajahon se pehle se hi kai telecom companiyon kii haalat kharaab thi, aise main supreme court kaa nirnay unke liye bada jhatka sabit hua he
 Especially telecom companies vodafone-idea Ltd and Airtel have incurred huge losses due to AGR
 vodaphone idia ko duusari timahi main 50,921 karod rupee kaa bada ghaataa hua he
 It is being described as the biggest quarterly loss in corporate history of India
 ghate kii badi vajah yah he ki companiyon ko agiaar ke liye provijaning kerani pad rahi he yani ek tay raashi alag rakhni pad rahi he
 Vodafone Chief Executive (CEO) Nick Reid says business in India has been extremely challenging for a long time
 unhone yah bhi sanket diya ki sarkaar se raahat nahin mili to vodaphone bharat se apana kaarobaar samet sakati he
 According to the results released on this Thursday, Airtel has incurred a huge loss of Rs 23,045 crore in the july-september 2019 quarter

 america kii purv videshmantri kondalija rice ne apni ek pustak main daawa kiya he ki pradhanmantri manmohan singh bharat-america asainya parmaanu qaraar par aage badhane ko lekar shuru main anicchhuk the or vah unase milanaa tak nahin chaahate the, kyonki vah (singh) unhen naa nahin kahana chaahate the
 In fact, Condoleezza Rice's pressure-making skills were behind this agreement, since no one involved in the Bush administration expected the agreement to be completed
 kondalija ne apni haalia pustak ‘no hair honor’ main is parmaanu qaraar ke ghatnakram kaa zikr kiya he
 The book will be available in stores on November 1
 singh jab america raashtrapati george dablyoo bush se white house sthit unke ovel karyaalay main mulaakaat karne vaale the, us din subah ke vakt ko yaad karte hue kondalija ne apni pustak main likhaa he, ‘‘main subah saadhe chaar baje jag gai or bistar par baith gai
 "the day before, the entire Bush administration had given up hope on the nuclear deal, while the White House was pushing this agreement out loud
" vahiin, bharat ke tatkaaleen videsh mantri natwar singh is qaraar ke paksh main the lekin pradhanmantri (singh) iske paksh main nahin the kyonki vah is baat ko lekar aashwast nahin the ki isse nayi dilli ko sahamat kar lenge
 Kondalija said in the 784-page book, "natwar was in favor of the deal but the Prime Minister was not sure that he would agree to New Delhi
" aakhirkaar, natwar ne kaha ki vah is dastavej ko pradhanmantri ke paas le jaaenge
 "the US Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns was quoted as saying," The foreign minister tried but the prime minister could not sign the deal immediately
 ’’ isse pehle natwar singh samjhaute ke liye antim koshish kar chuke the
 Kondalija wrote, "I spoke to the President (bush)
 maine kaha ki aisa nahin hone ja rahaa
 Singh will not allow this to happen
 unhone kaha ki bahut bura hua tathaa unhone or mujh par adhik dabaav nahin daalaa
 Later that night, Nick called me and asked if i knew there would be no agreement
 ’’ bush-singh kii baithak ke din kondalija subah jaldi jag gai thi, isliye vah thode tanaav main thim lekin unhone yah mauka nahin ganvaane kaa sankalp liya
 He made a final effort to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself and pave the way for this agreement

 Since Sunday night, Pakistan has been continuously firing at the international border in Jammu and Kashmir, but when the Indian security forces are not able to cross, now the Pakistani intelligence agency ISI has made a big conspiracy to carry out the IED blast on the highway through terrorists
 pakistan sarhad kii bastiyon main golabari karne ke baad IED dhamaake ke jariye logon ko nishaanaa banane kii firaaq main he
 According to the exclusive intelligence report received by Aaj Tak, the Border Security Force (BSF) retaliated badly and Pakistan has conspired to carry out a massive blast by building an IED plant on Jammu and Kashmir's kathua-samba highway through its terrorists
 sutron ke mutabik pakistan jammu-kashmir ke suraksha pratishthanon (security Installations)or suraksha balon par hamalaa kar saktaa he
 Security forces have been alerted after the intelligence report
 itnaa hi nahin, report main yah bhi kaha gaya ki jammu kshetra main padane vaale suraksha pratishthanon or suraksha balon par hamale ke liye bhi aatanki IED kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 It is known that for the last several days, Pakistan has been firing continuously on the international border
 haalanki bharat kii ore se use munhtod jawaab diya ja rahaa he
 Fearing the action of Indian security forces on Sunday, Pakistan begged Rahm in the first day and requested the BSF to cease firing on the border, but then opened fire at around 10:10 pm

 The BJP has also started its Vijay Vikas Yatra from Sunday
 jisamen dilli bijepi ke adhyaksh manoj tiwari chunaav prachaar ke liye nikle hai
 BJP has been in power of MCD in Delhi for last ten years

 Green vegetables are a treasure of health since childhood
 hari or patteydaar subjiyon se dimag tej hota he, ankhon kii roshni badhati he sehat acchhee rahati he
 But the vegetables that you have considered to be the king of health can also make your body hollow
 ab jaraa saavdhaan ho jaaen jin subjiyon ko aap sehat kaa khajaana maan kar khate aae hai vah aapke sharir ko aisi tamaam bimariyon kaa ghar bana sakati hai jisase ubarna mumkin nahin hoga
 Can you believe that some vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage, eggplant, and okra can make you sick
 in subjiyon se sharir main aise keede pahunch sakate hai jo aapako gambhir beemaari ke agosh main dhakel sakati hai
 We are not saying this, these doctors say
 in subjiyon main keedaa laganaa aam baat he
 But if these insects have gone into your body, then the difficulties can be bigger
 subjiyon ke keede se daure pad sakate hai
 Vegetable worms can cause liver damage
 doctoron kii maane to sharir ke andar pahunchane ke baad keede khun ke jariye dimaag tak pahunch sakate hai
 This can make you hollow by penetrating other parts of the body
 maiks aspataal ke medicine salaahkaar, dow es si mishra bataate hai ki kide akasar dimag main chale jate hai or iske kaaran epilpasi kii beemaari ho jaati he yahi nahin keede pet main pahunchakar use to nuksaan pahuchaate hi hai lekin saath hi pet ke raste liver tak chale jate hai
 Yes, with eating larvae of vegetable worms, they first go into our body and then they reach the brain through blood
 aise main insaan epilepsy kaa shikaar ho saktaa he
 That means he will start having seizures
 doctoron kii maane to yah halaat kisi bhi insaan ke liye behad khatarnaak ho sakate he
 Apart from this, these insects can also damage the liver and kidney through the stomach
 chintaa kii baat yah he ki agar samay rahete keedon kaa pataa nahin chalaa to maamla gambhir ho saktaa he
 Epilepsy can take a terrible form, the kidneys may stop working, and the liver may also deteriorate
 doctoron kii maane to salad se sabase bada khatra hota he
 If you eat green leafy vegetables as a salad, then there is an increased risk of getting insects into the body
 to saavdhaan ho jaaen or jab bhi sabji khaaen to use khub dekh bhaal kar, jaanch parakh kar
 It should not happen that what you are eating as a treasure of health, vegetables and salad make you sick
 bharat jaise desh main jahaan saaf safai par kam hi dhyaan diya jaataa he vahaan fal, subjiyan, kachche maance jeevanuon ke ghar ban jate hai
 These bacteria infect vegetables and fruits through dirty water and environment
 inamen tap varm, i coli jaise aam jeevanu bhi hai jo kai baar jaanaleva sabit hote hai
 Just know about these dangerous insects, worms and bacteria
 tap varm sabase khatarnaak krimi he jo subjiyon or maance main aamtaur par paaya jaataa he
 Through food, it first reaches the stomach and then along with blood reaches other parts of the body, even the brain
 isse insaan ko neurosistiscosis jaisi khatarnaak beemaari ho jaati he
 This disease causes epileptic seizures
 tap varm kii tarah hi i
 Disease causing bacteria like coli and salmonella are also very dangerous and these germs are also found on vegetable fruits
 falon, subjiyon main paae jane vaale chloastrodium, botulifem, shijela, selamonella jaise jeevanu bhi sharir par hamalaa karne main peeche nahin rahete
 Fruits and vegetables infected with these bacteria are more dangerous for young children, old people and vulnerable people
 khet se lekar mandi tak khatre kai hai
 The main reason for insects in vegetables is in the fields
 lekin kai baar mandiyon kii gandagi bhi sehat se khilwaad karti hai
 Clean and vegetable vegetables also reach the market and become the home of disease
 kaarobaariyon ko isse fark nahin padataa ki wo subjiyon ko jaisi jagahon par rakhte hai or bechate hai usase subjiyan khaane laayak nahin rah jaati
 Because they only care about profits
 subjiyon se beemaari kii ek badi vajah unhen ugane kii jagah bhi he
 Many times vegetable growers use drains water for good yield
 kai baar aisi jagahon par subjiyan ugaai jaati hai jahaan factriyon se nikalataa ganda pani girtaa he
 Yields in such places are good, but these vegetables give disease rather than health
 aise pani se subjiyon main kai tarah ke bacteria janm lete hai
 It is important that we take some precaution before eating them
 behad jaruri he ki ham kachi subjiyon, kachche falon, ankurit anaaj, salad aadi kaa istemaal behad saavdhaanee se karen
 Wash vegetables, fruits thoroughly with water
 kachche maance andey kaa upyog katai naa karen varanaa hamaari thodi si bhi laaparvaahee jaanaleva sabit ho sakati he
 According to doctors, some precautions can protect you from dangerous diseases caused by vegetables
 un subjiyon khaas taur par saavdhaanee baratani chahie jo dharti ke zyada kareeb hoti hai
 Vegetables such as spinach, carrots, radish, cauliflower, cabbage, okra, and brinjal are close to the earth, so there is a greater risk of insects
 doctoron kii salaah he ki aisi subjiyon ko kaatane yaa chhilne se pehle acchhee tarah dho len
 By peeling the vegetable without washing, many times bacteria present on the peels can also go inside the vegetable while peeling
 bartan main pani rakh kar dhone kii bajaae chalate nal main sabji dhoe
 Vegetables can be cleaned with a small brush if needed
 yun to subjiyan sharir ko vitamin, aayran jaise jaruri poshtik tatv dete hai lekin agar inaki safai main laaparvaahee barti gai to isse kai tarah kii bimaariyaan bhi ho sakati hai

 In a recent study report about expensive drugs given in cancer, some such revelations have been made, which you will be shocked to hear
 adhyayan kii report ke anusaar cancer beemaari ko thik karne ke naam par di jane vaali mahangi dawaaon ko darasal, sehat par koi asar hota hi nahin he
 In fact, these drugs do not improve the patient's condition
 jabaki ye mahangi dawaaen rogiyon main maut ke khatre ko badha detii hai
 These medicines given in the name of improvement cause their condition to worsen rather than improve in the patient suffering from cancer
 yah landan ke kings college or landan skool of iconomics ke shodhakartaaon ne kiya he
 According to the researchers, these drugs sold with false hopes in the name of curing cancer have a bad effect on a person's body
 yah adhyayan saal 2009 se 2013 tak kiya gaya
 During this, in 57% of the cases, it was found that the drugs given in cancer do not benefit patients much
 ek duusari stdi main yah khulaasa kiya gaya ki haalanki zyaadaatar mahangi dawaaon se cancer peedit vyaktigaye kii haalat main koi sudhaar nahin hota, lekin jin dawaaon kaa thodaa-bahut asar hota he, wo rogi ke jivan ko sirf 2 se 3 maheene hi bachaa paati hai
 But these medicines are so expensive that it is not enough for all the patients to buy it
 elesai ke shodhakarta hossain naisi ke anusaarcancer kii davaaonmen sudhaar karne kii kaaphi zarurat he
 Due to approval given by the European Medical Agency, these drugs are being sold in all European countries along with Britain
 bataa den ki european medical agency dwaara die gaye apruval vaali dawaaon ko kai baar NICE ne swikaarne se inkaar bhi kiya he
 Also, according to a research published in the British Medical Journal of researchers, such expensive drugs, which have no effect on the disease, prove to be very harmful for the suffering person
 adhyayankartaaon ke mutabik yah ek tarah se sansadhano kaa galat istemaal he
 This research also revealed that most drugs were approved on the wrong basis
 yah bhi saamne aayaa ki 35 fisadi ilaaj main in dawaaon se beemaari thik hui or keval 10 fisadi ilaaj main sudhaar dikhaai diya
 While 57 percent of the treatments were such that neither the disease was cured nor there was any improvement

 Lalu Yadav has suffered another major setback after his ouster from power in Bihar
 27 agast ko patna ke gandhi maidan main hone vaali jis mahareli ke peeche vah apni puri takat laga rahe the uski hawa nikal gai he
 Lalu Yadav claimed that the rally, called "save the country BJP," will lay the foundation of the grand alliance of opposition and unite opposition leaders to face the BJP for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 lekin ek ke baad ek kai partiyaan ab is raily se kinaaraa kar rahi hai
 Mayawatiyah had already said that she would not attend the rally herself, but Lalu Yadav claimed that she would send senior party leader Satish Mishra to the rally
 lekin guuruuvaar ko mayawati ne yah saaf kar diya ki naa to vah khud is raily main jaaengi or naa hi unki party se koi netaa isamen sharif hoga
 Lashing out at Lalu Yadav's wishes, Mayawati said that until the matter is clear about ticket distribution, there is no point in attending the rally alone
 sonia or rahul gandhi ne pehle hi de diya tha jhatchisse pehle lalu yadav ko jhatka tab laga tha jab congress ne yah saaf kar diya tha ki sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi, priyanka gandhi main se koi bhi is raily main nahin jayega
 From the Congress, only Ghulam Nabi Azad and CP Joshi are going to this rally
 left partiyon ne bhi is raily se kinaaraa kar liya he or isamen shariq nahin honge
 So far according to the news, Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav is going to the rally
 lekin jis tarah se ek ke baad ek partiyaan or netaa is raily se kinaaraa kar rahe hai usase lalu yadav kii bechaini jarur bad gai hogi
 The most talked about rally of Lalu Yadav on 27 August was the fact that Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati, who have been strong political enemies of each other till now, will be seen on one stage
 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav ko dekhte hue uttar pradesh main ise bahut bade raajnneetik pherbadal ke taur par dekha ja rahaa tha or yah kaha ja rahaa tha ki agar is raily se samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ke bich main daraar mit jaati he to bijepi ke liye upi main chunauti bahut gahari ho jaaegi
 But the BJP must have breathed a relief from this stance of Mayawati
 baadh ke samay main kar rahe hai raleelalu yadav kii raily aise samay par kar rahe hai jab khud unke alaava unke bete or beti bhrashtachar ke maamalon main inakam tex or idi kii jaanch ke lapete main hai
 The loop of investigation is gradually being tightened on the Lalu family
 lalu yadav kii musiibat isliye bad gai kyonki unki raily aise samay par ho rahi he jab bihar bhayankar baadh ke chapet main fansaa hua he or saikadon logon kii baadh kii vajah se jaan ja chuki he
 BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi appealed to Lalu Yadav to postpone his rally in view of the floods
 lekin susheel yadav kii salaah ko darkinar karte hue lalu yadav ne kaha tha ki susheel modi unhen sikh dene kii koshish naa karen
 It is believed that many other leaders, including the left parties, are skeptical about going to the rally because they feel that rallying during such floods will send a wrong message to the people that the parties are trying to strengthen their vote bank amid the tragedy
 Huh
 ab raily main le dekar bade netaa ke naam par sirf pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri mamata banerjee hi bachati hai
 Apart from this, JDU leader Sharad Yadav, who split his path from Nitish Kumar, will be in this rally
 lekin raily se pehle hi itnaa saaf ho gaya ki lalu yadav is raily ke dam par vipaksh ke majboot dhuree ke taur par apni jo pahchaan bananaa chaahate the unka vah sapana chakanachur ho chukaa he

 vaahid kaa daawa he ki jis tarah dhamaakon main maare gaye log peedit hai, usee tarah vah bhi peedit hai
 Nine years ago, Abdul Wahid used to teach children, then on July 11, there was a Silesilewar train explosion in Mumbai
 abdul ko dhamaakon main shaamil hone ke aarope main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 After 9 years, the court acquitted him of all charges
 lekin ab na unki ankhon main bacchon ko padhaane ke liye pehle jaisi takat bachi he or na hi jindagi ko lekar khwab
 While talking to NDTV, Abdul Wahid said that in 9 years everything has been ruined
 ab unke paas karne ko kuch nahin he
 Life has come on the road
 vaahid ko khud jail kii chahardivari se chhootane kii khushi he, lekin unka kahana he ki dhamaake ke 12 gunaahagaar bhi nirdosh hai
 They are also victims of explosions in the same way as 188 people killed in the blasts
 tippaniyan The debate on the punishment of all the 12 convicts has started on Friday
 adaalat main sabhi ne khud ko nirdosh bataaya
 Lawyers for all the culprits also applied to have their sentences reduced
 unki health report mangane par adaalat ne hami bhar di he, lekin probeshan report or aparaadh ko kam karne vaale gavaahon ke sakshya par faisla mangalvaar ko hoga
 In the debate on sentencing, usually the prosecution first pleads for punishment and argues in its favor, but turns upside down in MCOCA court on Monday
 sabase pehle doshiyon ke bayaan liye gaye or unhen kyon kam se kam sajaa di jaae is par bachaav paksh ko pehle daleel pesh karne di gai
 The debate will continue on Tuesday
 nau saal pehle abdul vaahid bacchon ko padhaate the, tabhi 11 july ko mumbai main silecelewar train dhamaake hue
 Abdul was arrested for his involvement in the blasts
 9 saal baad adaalat ne unhen saare aaropon se bari kar diya
 But now there is neither the power left in their eyes to teach the children nor the dream about life
 en di tii ve se baat karte hue abdul vaahid ne bataaya ki 9 saalon main unka sab kuch barbaad ho chukaa he
 Now they have nothing to do
 jindagi sadak par aa chuki he
 Wahid himself is happy to be released from the prison walls, but he says that the 12 guilty of the blast are also innocent
 ve bhi usee tarah dhamaakon ke peedit hai, jis tarah dhamaakon main maare gaye 188 log
 The comments shuukravaar ko doshi tehraae gaye sabhi 12 gunaahagaaron kii sajaa par bahes shuru ho chuki he
 Everyone in the court declared himself innocent
 saare gunahagaaron ke vakeelon ne unki sajaa kam karne ke liye aavedan bhi diya
 The court has agreed to call for his health report, but a decision on the probation report and the evidence of the witnesses reducing the crime will be decided on Tuesday
 sajaa par bahes main amuman pehle abhiyojan paksh sajaa kii maang or uske paksh main daleel pesh karata he, lekin somvaar ko macoka court main ulta hua
 First the statements of the culprits were taken and the defendants were allowed to present arguments on why they should be punished the least

 hedli ne yah bhi kaha ki usne apni jindagi par ek kitaab likhane kii or ek film banane kii yojana banaai thi
 Rana's lawyer Patrick Blagden said Headley had told many people, including his wife
 hedli ne kaha, ‘yadi main kitaab likhata hum to bahut sara dhan hasil kar saktaa hum

 maine apane kaam main uski madad ke liye use murkh banaaya
 While Headley confessed his guilt, Rana says he was not guilty of helping in terrorism

 Rana and Headley met at a military school in Pakistan as a teenager
 hedli ne mana ki vah gopneey tareeke se internet par rana ke ghar kii talash kar rahaa tha
 Lawyer Blagen said, 'as expected, this man has a very troubled history and past
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘meraa maananaa he ki usne sawaalon kaa jawaab haa main diya kyonki hamaare paas uski baat kaatane ke liye dastavej the
 'blagen said,' he was lying before
 ’ hedli ne mukademe ke dauraan hamalon main bhartiya logon ke maare jane par pachhtaawaa jataayaa

 blegan ne poocha ki kya tum khud ke taur tareekon main badlaav kar rahe ho? hadlee kaa jawaab tha, ‘haa’ blegan ne poocha, ‘tum kab badale?’ is par hadlee ne kaha, ‘koi nishchit taarikh nahin he lekin main kar rahaa hum
 Charlie Rift, another Rana lawyer, said Headley used Rana for a long time and that he is a criminal
 swift ne kaha ki hadlee ne apni patni ko bhi dhokhaa diya
 He said, 'he could not hide the truth for three days
 hedli ek makadi kii tarah he jo jaale bunata he or sari chijen uske mutabik kaam karti hai
 Swift said, "in the last three days, the correct picture of David Headley has come out
 ’ unhone kaha ki hedli ne rana ko apane jaal main fansaane ke liye use dhan diya tha
 FBI agents and Rana's relatives will be the next witnesses in the case
 hedli ne yah yojana bhi banaai ki jail se reeha hone ke baad vah apni patni shajia ke saath dharmik kaam karegaa or duniya ko islam ke bare main batayega
 He is expecting a lesser sentence from the court
 hedli ne kaha, ‘main chahta hum ki mere bachche bhi aisa karen
 i believe there is a misconception in the media about Islam
 ’ hedli ne apni patni se kaha he ki uske jail main band rahane ke dauraan vah quran ke saath bible bhi padhe

 Interestingly, some people who do politics without understanding the mood of the country, see the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as a party in the current Lok Sabha elections
 ye aise hi log hai jo kisi kitaab ke panne palate bagaiyr uski samiksha kaa dam rakhte hai
 The daily branch is the first and necessary step to review the functioning and nature of the Sangh, how many alleged Sangh analysts read this first and the most important page? Those who do not see anything other than electoral movements these days, may be shocked to know that the work of the Sangh goes on continuously irrespective of the situation
 saath hi kisi kaam ke liye jaruri badlaav bhi sangh hameshaa karata rahaa he
 "change is an irreversible rule", Sarsanghchalak Mohanrao Bhagwat himself said in a clear word from the public forum in the recently released program of Panchjanya, the new magazine form of Panchjanya, organized in Delhi
 chunavi bayaar se sangh ke mul kaam-kaaj ke prabhavit hone kaa kayaas lagane waalon ke liye yah jaananaa dilachasp ho saktaa he ki dilli main matdaan se thik pehle ke ativyast rajnatik ghatnakramon ke bich bhi (24 se 31 march ke dauraan) sangh kaa praathmik shikshan varg na sirf har varsh kii tarah yojit hua balki isamen pichley varsh ke mukaable 700 zyada shikshaarthi shaamil hue
 Every year about 1 lakh youth participants of 13 to 40 years join the Sangh at their own expense through such sections all over the country
 shakhaon or swayamsevakon kii badhati sankhya ko bhi sirf maujuuda paridrishy se jodakar dekhnaa galat hoga kyonki shakhaaen badhaane kaa abhiyaan teen varsh se chal rahaa he
 This is the third time in a row that 2,000 new branches of the union have grown
 janvari 2012 se keval rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii website 222
 Humph shahmdd ke jariye hi har maah ausatan 2,000 yuva sangh se jud rahe hai or is tarah yah samaaj ko samarpit vishwa kaa sabase yuva sanghathan he
 Political intellectuals beset by the Bharatiya Janata Party's call should take a little rest after this election and correct the mistake of assuming the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as a political volunteer
 swayamsevakon ke samarpan se vanavaasi kalyaan, shiksha, seva, chikitsa aadi kshetron main vyapak str par kiye ja rahe kaaryon kaa fursat se liya najaara yah bataane ke liye kaaphi hoga ki sangh buniyadi taur par saamaajik sanghathan kyon kehalaata he or iske kaam kaa dayera or soch kitni badi he
 Actually, there is a group of politicians who curse the Sangh and thrive on the rubbing of power, which does not know anything about society other than politics
 janata ke dukh-dard, kshobh or aakrosh ko nakaarne yaa akaaran maanane vaale aise vishleshkon ko apane kurte ke kalf kii chintaa bhrashtachar kii un kalank kathaon se zyada he jo maujuuda sarkaar ke maathe par likhi hai
 It is a power-oriented thinking that considers politics as a tool of social control and larger than society
 samaaj aapas main ulajh rahe, is soch kii yahi koshish rahati he
 Today, people are asleep in the corridors of authoritarian politics because of the possibility of the society becoming united and this resolve power awakened
 samaaj ke saath ekatm sangh use daraata he, matadaataaon ke daravaaje par adhiktam matdaan kaa aahvaan karti swayamsevakon kii har khatkhathat, samaaj main sangh kaa sammaan or iske kaaryakartaaon kii mehnat se jutai atmiyata use khatra lagati he
 Today, if this awakening of society has become a threat to anyone's politics and a possibility for someone, then it should not be the association versus allotment, but the concerns that have made power the defender of society
 sach he ki 1977 ke baad yah doosraa mauka he jab loksabhaa chunaav main sangh kii ‘‘kuch’’ sakriyata najar aati he, magar iske liye un sthitiyon kii samiksha jaruri he jo maujuuda satta ne samaaj ke liye paidaa kii hai
 The society has its voice in the concerns of the Sangh, but with this election it neither needs anything for itself nor the Sangh is going to change even a little with the election results

 The matter of the right of all citizens, including traders, to put forth their views and interests before the government cannot be questioned
 sarkaar kii kisi agency ke faisle se agar kisi ko shikaayat he to use puraa adhikaar he ki ucch adhikariyon ke saamne us faisle kii samiksha yaa use badalane ke liye apni baat rakh sake

 If the decision of the lower officer is changed, then it should be considered a crime only when there is clear evidence that the decision to change it was taken illegally, to benefit someone unfairly or because of corruption The reason was done so
 agar utpaadak desh banane kii hamaari aakankshaon ko puraa karnaa he to kisi bhi sarkari adhikari yaa mantri ke nek iraade se kiye gaye (sadashayi) faisle kaa bachaav kiya janaa chahie
 India has not been a competitive producing country till now
 hamen yah baat samajhane kii jarurat he ki duniya main koi bhi desh tab tak pratispardhi utpaadak desh nahin ban sakaa he, jab tak ki is lakshya ko hasil karne main sarkaar or udyog jagat ke bich aapasi sahyog na rahaa ho
 Government departments need to take all the steps that make trade in the country easier and reduce production costs
 udyogpatiyon ko bhi apane kshetra main aisa hi karne kii jarurat he
 But for this it is essential that there is an open dialogue between government departments and industrialists so that they can understand all the issues and problems properly to become more competitive
 tabhi pratispardhaa badhaane ke liye jaruri kadam uthaae ja sakate hai
 It will then be considered part of the necessary step to present its stand and demand changes in existing procedures and rules
 sarkari adhikariyon ko pratispardhaa badhaane ke liye kanoonee rup se sahi faisla lene main hichak nahin dikhaani chahie
 The government's steps in making Indian companies competitive should be such that it will bring economic benefits to industry and industrialists
 yah is avadharana par aadhaarit he ki nijee kshetra hi utpaadan ke maamle main desh ko pratispardhi banane main aguai karegaa
 If an industrialist makes his report to the government and any change is made due to it, then the industrialist will definitely benefit from it
 samasya yah he ki sarkaar ke kisi kadam se yadi kisi nijee party ko aarthik laabh miltaa he to vah bhrashtachar nirodhak kanoon kii dhara 13(1)(di)(3) ke tahat aapraadhik aacharan mana ja saktaa he
 Your conduct will fall completely into the category of 'crime' if it is not in the 'public interest' or 'misuse of office' in decision making
 lekin main jin sthitiyon par charchaa kar rahaa hum unamem dmajanhitadya kya he? kisi nijee company kii pratispardhaa badhaane ke liye sansadhano kaa aavanton karnaa janhit main he yaa nahin? lekin yahi faisle agar kisi saarvajanik kshetra kii company ke liye kiye jate hai to unhen janhit main mana jaataa he
 But since the increase in production and competition comes freely from the private sector, how would any government official take decisions that would increase the competitiveness of the private sector
 isi tarah pad ke durupyog kaa niyam bhi spasht nahin he
 If a decision makes a private sector company more competitive, then that decision is considered "misuse of office"? And the same decision will be acceptable if it is taken for a PSU
 ateet main sarkari adhikari bahut se maamalon main faisle lene se kataraate rahe hai, kyonki unhen is kanoon ke tahat funsane kaa dar sataata tha
 This law has now been applied to the former coal secretary
 kanoon kii yah dhara jab tak barkaraar rahegi, tab tak sarkari adhikariyon ko apana purana ravaiya badalane ke liye raji karnaa bahut kathin hoga
 And if this happens, the effort of 'make in India' will surely be incomplete

 ' ye shaadi ke prastaav mangane ke liye gita ke profile main likhaa he
 Geeta is the same deaf girl who was brought from Pakistan to India in 2015 at the initiative of the Ministry of External Affairs
 gita ke mata-pita ko dhundhakar uske ghar bhejnaa tha
 Some people even made claims of Geeta being their daughter
 diene milan nahin hone kii vajah segita ke asal mata-pitrub tak nahin mil sake
 If there was no result for such a long wait, Geeta started feeling frustrated
 uski jindagi main kuch nayaapan or sthayitv laane ke makasad se uski shaadi kii baat sochi gai
 When Geeta too expressed such a wish, the management of the Anand deaf-deaf organization of Indore wrote a letter to the Ministry of External Affairs in this matter
 ye vahi sanstha he jise gita kii dekh-rekh kii jimmedaari saunpi gai thi
 Geeta is staying in the hostel of this institution
 videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj se hari jhandi milane ke baad gita ke liye yogya var kii talash kii ja rahi he
 There are many proposals from all over the country for boys wanting to marry Geeta
 abhi tak 25 se zyada prastaav mili hai jinamein se 15 videsh mantralay ko bheje ja chuke hai
 Gyanendra Purohit, associated with Anand mute deaf organization, also got proposals for Geeta's wedding on Facebook
 prastaav bhejne waalon main sainik, patrkaar, vyavsaayee, lekhak, kisaan, mithai dukandaar shaamil hai
 Only proposals with better bio-data are being sent to the Ministry of External Affairs
 vahaan se jo bhi nirdesh milenge usee ke mutabik gita kii shaadi ke sambandh main faisla kiya jayega
 From the introduction conference to social sites for the Gita, the groom is being searched
 ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki icchhuk yuvak biodeta ke saath indore main anand mook badhir sanstha se sidhe sampark bhi kar sakate hai
 According to Monika Purohit, associated with the organization, 70% of those sending biodata are deaf and 30% are normal
 ‘ajtak’ ne gita se shaadi kii ichha rakhane vaale kai aavedakon se baat kii
 Like Mahesh, who lives in Mangalia near Indore, worships in the temple
 mahesh kaa kahana he ki gita se unki shaadi hoti he to wo bahut khush rahegi
 Suresh Sisodia, who works with such sweets, says, 'I want to marry Geeta, i will take her every Sunday
 ’is vishay main punjab ke ludhiana or bihar ke saharsa main un danpatiyon se bhi baat kii gai jinhone kabhi gita ke apni santan hone kaa daawa kiya tha lekin diene milan main unke daawey kii pushti nahin ho pai
 One such person is Janardhana Mahato living in Ludhiana
 mul rup se bihar ke nivasee janardan kaa ab bhi daawa he ki vahi gita ke pita hai or unhen gita kii shaadi par kanyadan kaa mauka milanaa chahie
 All the members of Janardhana's family are confident that if Geeta gets married, they will get an invite and they will be able to join in the happiness of 'beti'
 isi tarah bihar ke saharsa jile ke kabiraa dhaap gaanv main rahane vaale ek dampati kaa bhi daawa rahaa he ki gita unki beti he, lekin iske liye wo koi saboot nahin dikhaa pate
 When 'aaj Tak' reached this village, they met the couple's son Balaram Mahato
 balram ne kaha ki gita kii shaadi jahaan bhi ho achche ghar main honi chahie
 According to Balaram, if his father gets an invitation, he will go to the wedding
 (ludhiana main munish atre ke inputs ke saath) The fate of the police shone that day
 jise usne chota-motaa badmaash samajhakar pakadaa tha, vah manja hua apradhi or sharp shooter niklaa
 Last week, the rogue Sarman Shivhare ran into the hands of Satna police by robbing a bullion businessman
 jis shivahare ko vah nausikhia badmaash samaj rahi thi, jab usne apane karnaamon kaa khulaasa kiya to khud police bhi sann rah gai
 a resident of Panna district, Sarman mainly targeted bullion traders
 25 july ko satna ke mukhtyarganj ke sarrapha vyavsaayee ramadutt soni par hamalaa kar saraman or uske do saathi dukaan se jevaraton se bharaa bag lekar bhaagane lage
 Sarman opened fire on Soni and his wife Shobha to protest, but by then the crowd had gathered
 saraman ke saathi to bhaag nikle lekin vah bheed ke haath lag gaya or logon ne use police ke hawaale kar diya
 When Sarman opened his mouth in front of the police, the secrets of many unsolved cases that had become puzzles also came to light
 30 saal ke saraman ne mahaj teen saal main gwalior se lekar jabalpur, indore or pradeshbhar main 18 logon kii hatya or lut kii vaardaat kabool kii
 It was also revealed that as a sharp shooter he was associated with criminals from several states
 is bich satna police ne gwalior main soochna di, jisaki vajah se saraman ke teen saathi rajakishor, vedaprakash or deepak chaurasia bhi pakade gaye jabaki ek anya saathi inder singh reva se pakadaa gaya
 At the time of the robbery in Satna, Sarman's bullet was hit in the foot of Rajkishore
 pichley teen saal se yah giroh pradesh ke sarrapha kaarobaariyon ke liye khauf kaa doosraa naam bana hua tha or anek vyavsaayiyon kii hatya bhi kar chukaa tha
 In the last one year, Sarman and his gang were involved in the murder of many businessmen, including gems businessmen Rajendra Sahu, Prabhat Aggarwal, Rakesh Jain, Neeraj Gupta, Vijay Jain in Gwalior
 indore main 2008 main ek hira vyapaaree or dow
 Sarman was also murdered by his compounder including Varsha
 vah police se luti gai pistaul se hatya karata tha
 One pistol was looted by killing Havildar Rajkumar in Jabalpur and the other was shot by shooting a soldier named Shivakant in Gwalior
 ab gwalior, satna, indore or ujjain police sahit estf inkaa network khojane main juty he
 Many bank accounts and lockers of Sarman have been found in Indore and Ujjain
 uske paas se bees farji pan card, 15 driving license or 25 cellphone bhi baraamad hue hai
 Vijay Yadav, IG of Gwalior Range, says, "deepak, a partner of Sarman had worked with many bullion traders in Gwalior, so he knew many things related to them which proved to be beneficial in the incident
 jabaki vedaprakash or rajakishor tantra-mantra or pujapath kii aad main lut kaa maal thikaane lagaate the
 “they had bought property and many cars from the loot
 rajakishor ke gwalior sthit ghar kii talaashi main lakhon ru
 From the house of Deepak, the police found several dozen fake PAN cards, driving licenses, voter ID cards and keys of more than a hundred bikes
 poochtacha main saraman ne yah bhi bataaya ki lut kii rakam ko vah bank ke loker main surakshit rakhata tha
 He also kept a pistol in the locker
 haalanki uske ek darjan lokaron main se zyada rakam nahin mili he, isliye police ko shaq he ki luute gaye paison or gahanon ko vah kahin or bhi thikaane lagaataa hoga
 The State STF is now finding out which states have links with crooks from which states
 estf ko yah bhi shaq he ki saraman ke sambandh mumbai ke anderworld se ho sakate hai yaa vah kisi aise giroh se judaa ho saktaa he jo pradesh main dehshat failaana chahta ho
 IG of Rewa Range

 Says Meena, "given Sarman's style of committing the crime, the police suspect him to have a deep criminal connection which is being investigated
" ''saraman or uske giroh ke pakade jane ke baad, ilaake main badhate aparaadh par lagaam kasne main naakaam rahi gwalior police raahat kii saans le rahi he, jise ummid he ki pichley dedh saal se ilaake main jari kaarobaariyon kii sansanikhej hatya kaa silsilaa shaayad ab band ho sakegaa
 In order to teach the tricks of dealing with vicious criminals like Sarman, the state police is now preparing to teach his crime style to trainee soldiers

 Not only this, if any information was found wrong in the passport application from Tanvi, then an FIR can also be lodged against him under the Passport Act
 haalanki police abhi jaanch kaa hawala de rahi he
 What was the matter that the couple accused the passport officer of insulting them in the name of religion

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team made history by not losing the Test series for the first time on the South African side by equalizing the three-test series 1-1 and now the eyes of Team India went a step ahead of it, starting in Durban from 12 January
 After winning the series of one-day matches, South Africa are set to win the ODI series for the first time
 dakshin africa main mehmaan team kii raah aasaan nahin hogi
 India won the 2007 Twenty20 World Cup on South African soil, while it also managed to reach the final of the 50-over World Cup in 2003, but its performance in odis against the hosts was always disappointing
 
 bharat ne dakshin africa kii dharti par 39 vanade match khele, jisamen se team 15 baar jeet darj karne main safal rahi, jabaki 21 baar use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Team India, however, was mostly beaten against South Africa, losing 16 times in 20 matches and winning only three times, while one match was inconclusive
 dakshin africa kii dharti par mejabaan team ke alaava anya tiimon ke khilaaf haalanki bharat kaa pradarshan behatar rahaa or usne 19 maichon main 12 jeet darj kii, jabaki use keval paanch baar shikast kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 India first played a seven-match ODI series led by Mohammad Azharuddin in 1992-93 on the return of South Africa after facing a boycott from cricket due to apartheid, in which Team India won only two matches and lost five matches
 Had to look at the mouth
 bhartiya team iske baad 1996-97 main master blaster sachin tendulkar kii aguai main dakshin africa gai or is baar dwipaksheeya vanade shrinkhalaa kii jagah usne trikoniya shrinkhalaa kheli, jisaki teesri team zimbabwe thi
 For India, this series was also very disappointing and he could register only one win in this series and that too against Zimbabwe
 team india ne 2001-02 main bharat ke saphaltam captainon main shumaar saurav ganguli kii aguai main dakshin africa main trikoniya shrinkhalaa kheli
 India defeated South Africa once in the league stage in this series, while beating Kenya twice
 team india ko haalanki is shrinkhalaa main kenya ke haathon bhi shikast jhelni padi jabaki dakshin africa ne bharat ko final sahit teen maichon main haraaya
 India played the last ODI series in South Africa under Rahul Dravid in 2006-07
 yah dwipaksheeya shrinkhalaa bharat ke liye traasadee kii tarah sabit hui or pehla match barish kii bhent chadhane ke baad dravid kii team ne baaki chaaron match ganvaa diye
