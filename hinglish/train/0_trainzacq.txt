 According to intelligence sources, Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI is helping to raise funds from different routes to erect al-badr in the valley
 sutron ke mutabik, paak adhikrut kashmir (POK) or khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa do jagahon par iesai kii madad se al badar ke naam se paisa jutaney ke liye poster baante gaye hai
 It says that money is needed to separate Jihad and Kashmir from Kashmir
 yahi nahin in donon ilaakon main qurbaani ke jariye al badar paisa vasuul rahaa he, yani bakron kii khaal bechakar khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa or paak adhikrut kashmir main is samay paisa jutaney main al badar ke aatanki lage hue hai
 With the help of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI, 2-commander Aslam Bhai of al-badr is recovering funds in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 vahiin liyakat jarine khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa main aatanki sanghathan al badar ke liye fund vasuulne main juta hua he
 According to intelligence sources, al-badr's chief Bakht Zarin has recently held a meeting in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, in which he has claimed that al-badar is going to become a major terrorist organization for the Kashmir Valley
 unhone is meeting main un do aatankiyon kaa bhi zikr kiya jo june main line of control paar karte huebhartiya suraksha balonke nishane par aa gaye the
 Both these terrorists were piled on the Line of Control by the Indian security forces
 al badar ke chif "bakht jarine" kashmir ghati or paak adhikrut kashmir main maujuud aatanki cmanderon ko yah nirdesh bhi de rahe hai ki vah ghati ke yuvaaon ko jihad ke naam par bhartee karen
 Intelligence sources have also informed Aaj Tak about al-badar that in the last few days, al-badar has been training its militant commanders in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir with the help of ISI along with terrorists of Lashkar, Jaish and Hizbul Mujahideen
 paak adhikrut kashmir main maujuud lashkar, jaish or hijbul mujahiddeen ke training camp main al- badar ke aatanki is vakt kaaphi sankhya main training le rahe hai
 According to sources, with the help of Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI, efforts are being made to send al-badr militants to the launching pad of Pakistan occupied Kashmir
 yahi vajah he ki ghuspaith karte vakt june ke maheene main bhartiya suraksha balon ne line of control par do aatankwaadiyon ko dher kar diya tha
 Who were al-badr terrorists
 kashmir ghati main bhi is vakt al badar ke aatanki maujuud hai

 isamen se hijbul 102, lashkar 47, jaish 27, al badr-10 or ansaar ul gajavat e hind ke 10 aatankwaadi hai
 That is, Al Badar's chief wants to create havoc in the Kashmir Valley through a small team of 10 terrorists of Al Badar

 But the concern is that with the help of ISI in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, the manner in which the terrorists of Al Badr have been co-ordinating
 vah aane vaale samay main ghati ke liye khatre kaa sabab ban saktaa hai
 Pakistan's intelligence agency is setting up al-badr, a terrorist organization that is not in the eyes of the world, to cover the world

 film kaa ek poster he jisamen jon kaa cheharaa nahin dikh rahaa he, lekin unhone jo vardi pahan rakhi he us par ‘sanjay kumaar’ ke naam kii nem plate he
 Along with the poster, he wrote, "70 encounters, 33 cases, 22 convictions, 9 gallantry awards, one charge, 'when you have achieved everything, one moment everything can be wiped out

 gujarat ke rajyapal opi kohli ne hair ajukeshan council bill ko manjuuri de di he
 The bill was introduced in the assembly last year by former state education minister Vasuben Trivedi
 us vakt anandiben patel mukhyamantri thim
 Why is the bill in dispute? The bill was passed on the last day of the budget session of March 2016
 vidhansabha spikar ne us din vipaksh ke saare sadasyon ko nilambit kar diya tha
 But the dispute over the bill is not just because of it
 iske praavdhaanon ko ucch shiksha sansthaanon kii swytta par hamalaa mana ja rahaa he
 After the implementation of these provisions, all the universities of the state will come under the Higher Education Council
 council siem kii adhyakshata main kaam karegi
 Apart from the Chief Minister, the Education Minister of the State and five vice-chancellors of the Universities of the State will be members of the Council
 mana ja rahaa he ki bill ke amal main aane ke baad up-kulapatiyon ke adhikaar ghatenge or rajya sarkaar ko vishvavidhyalayon ke sanchaalan main hastkshep kaa mauka milegaa
 According to the bill, the state government will take the final decision in deciding the syllabus of universities
 saath hi sarkaar gujarat ke vishvavidhyalayon ke prophessoron kaa tabadalaa desh ke kisi bhi kone main kar sakati he
 According to the government's government, the purpose of the bill is to monitor the educational, administrative and economic functions of higher education institutions and to suggest improvements in their performance
 bill ke mutabik sarkaar ke nirdesh vishvavidhyalayon ko sanchalit karne vaale maujuuda kanoonon kii jagah lenge
 Not only this, the guidelines of promotion of college staff will also be decided by the state government
 chaatro, adhyapakon kaa virohgujrat ke shikshavidon ke alaava chaatr sanghathan bhi bill kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 It was only after the bill was passed in the assembly that other higher education institutions, including Gujarat University, demanded to withdraw it
 lekin rajyapal ne in sabhi aitaraajon ko darkinar kar diya
 Educationist Professor Hemant Kumar believes that through the bill, the intention of the state government is clear
 unka aarope he ki sarkaar ko ab niti aadhaarit shaikshanik sansthaanon kii zarurat nahin rah gai he
 The central government will look into the objections
 On the other hand, Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar says that he has sought information related to the bill from the state government
 unhone mana ki samvidhan main rajya sarkaron ko aise kanoon banane kii ijaajat di gai he or isamen centre sarkaar kii bhoomika simit hoti he
 But still the central government will look into the objections of teachers and students in this matter

 10 Point Film Review: Madras Cafe at Panch Five Stardirector: Shujit Sarkar, Script: Somnath Dey, Shubhendu Bhattacharya, Dialogue: Juhi Chaturvedi: John Abraham, Nargis Fakhri, Prakash Belawadi, Rashi Khanna, Ajay Ratnam, Sidharth Basu, Piyush Pandey, Dibangamujic: Moitra, Cinematography: Kamaljeet Negi Duration: 130 minutes 1
 jon abraham kii film madras cafe hamen bhartiya hone ke naate garv ke kuch pal muhaiyaa karaati he
 It feels good to see that such a film was finally made in Hindi
 ek film, jo jab yuddh kii vibheeshikaa dikhaati he, to iskaa scale or sinerio bada hota he
 Despite this, the film also stops at fine details to give a halt to the tragedy
 acha lagata he ye dekhakar ki ek saghan film main jabaran gane yaa cinemai roopak rache pyaar kaa angel nahin thunsa gaya
 And it is a relief to see that the film does not lose its momentum anywhere and despite this speed, it maintains its dialogue with its meaning and audience
 agar ghatiya filmon ke boj tale dabe hai to madras cafe jarur dekhie
 Will not say it will be fun
 kyonki majaa shabd main masala tip sastaapan aa gaya he
 But yes, there will be a lot of doubt in the wonderful references and experiences of cinema
 2
 The film begins with a civil war in Sri Lanka
 isamen hajaaron begunaah tamilon or singhliyon kii jaan gai
 As one end of the Tamils connects with India, the government of India soon becomes a part of this war
 pis keeping force vahaan pahunchati he, magar kuch hi maheenon main swaagat sog (shok) main badal jaataa he
 But the government has to save face at all costs
 so vahaan sakriy tamil vidrohi gorilla group altief tigers ko kamjor karne ke liye gupt oparation chalaane kaa faisla hota he
 For this, Major Vikram of the Indian Army is sent there
 vikram ko srilanka ke uttari hisse main sthit jafana or duusari jagahon par ek duusare hi sach se bhidana padataa he
 In this sequence, there seems to be a time when LTF Tigers kingpin Anna Raw got stuck in the cycle
 magar aisa hota nahin
 Photo Gallery: Screening of 'madras Cafe', in the second half of the show of stars, Vikram, with the help of a foreign reporter Jaya and some other companions, comes to the risk of facing a threat from inside
 ant main use samaj aata he ki raajnneeti kii niyati or use rachane vaale is system main kai jhol hai
 Despite all the efforts, as the black date of Indian history tells and reminds us, May 21, 1991, the former Prime Minister of India kills a woman in a public meeting
 par kahani yaheen nahin rukati
 3
 film ke diarector shujit sarkaar isse pehle hamen damdaar patakatha or sitaron kii chamak se dur asli actors ke shandaar abhinay se saji viki donor jaisi film de chuke hai
 Madras Cafe is a canvas created in a different genre
 tanaav, antardwandv or unke bich rachi sajishon or unhen vifal karti kaarigari se yukt
 Shoojit does not let the film loose anywhere
 ek naragis fakhri ko chhodkar actors kaa chunaav, unki samvaad adaayagi, bhashaa kaa bartaav or aam darshakon ke liye kai aitihaasik or kam jaani pahachaani ghatnaon kaa jaruri sandarbh unhone behtareen dhang se bartaa he
 4
 jon abraham ne is film se apni abhinay kii range main badhotaree kii he
 Nargis Fakhri's face seems to be mostly blank
 film kii ek or actress raashi khanna chote se role main hi prabhavit karti hai
 She is the wife of Vikram
 acting kii baat karen to kai logon kaa kaam kaabile gaur or tarif he
 For example, many faces such as theater star Prakash Belawadi in the role of Head Bala of Raw's South Desk, Ajay Ratnam in the role of LTF Chief Anna, Siddharth Basu in the role of Chief of Raw and Dibang as an x Raw Agent Without trying to screen it, his character is left on the mind
 5
 The film sees the challenges of a soldier fighting a different type of war, the internal politics of RAW, the dilemma of the war correspondent and the honesty of the profession, the difficulties of the Covet operation and the general human being trapped in the mind of the Indian Army in Sri Lanka
 Shows the plight very finely
 yah film bhale hi kaalpanik bataai ja rahi ho, jaisaa ki jaruri bhi hota he, magar iske har hisse main itihaas ke reshe najar aate hai
 To avoid controversy, LTTE may have been renamed LTF, its head Prabhakaran has been renamed Anna or former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has just been called as Prime Minister
 magar is mulk ke jehan main ye sab naam or unki tasviren shishe kii tarah saaf hai
 6
 bharat kaa ye durbhaagya he ki yahaan kii asal sachai par baat karnaa jitna aasaan he, filmi parde par use utaarna utana hi duruh
 The slightest truth has not shown that the feelings of any class begin to hurt
 madras cafe ko lekar bhi yahi ho rahaa he
 But despite this danger, Shujit and John put this complicated and in many ways risky plot on the film screen
 uske liye vah ham sabaki tarif or shaabaasi ke hakdaar hai
 i hope that many more complex layers of the history of modern India will emerge in the form of stories in the same way
 7
 The film also has two weaknesses
 masalan, kuchhek jagahon par taarikh kii gadabadi najar aati he
 But this will be noticed by those who have studied the civil war in Sri Lanka closely
 film ke clymex or naireshan ke style ko lekar bhi kuch gunjaaish najar aati he
 Since the film was to be covered in a gap of two hours and there was no possibility of infinite spread of the plot, many things just come and go
 meraa suzav ye he ki film ko bina palak jhapakaae dekhen, varna kuch teji se aate or jate byore miss ho sakate hai or aise main ras kuch kam ho saktaa he
 8
 film kii kahani shubhendu ne likhi he or kya khub likhi he
 It is not easy to tell such a complex subject in a cinema-like genre
 sab kuch bataaya bhi or iske baavjood film bhatki nahin
 Juhi Chaturvedi has written good dialogues without being dramatic
 kahin bhi nahin lagata ki koi banaavat yaa naklipane ke saath saamne aa rahaa he
 Vigilance is seen everywhere from the choice of words to the accent
 9
 Kamaljeet Negi's camera work is amazing
 yuddh vah bhi gorilla andaaj main ladaa gaya, dikhaanaa aasaan kaam nahin
 But Negi has stopped the camera where the blood of mourning has thickened or the face has become a lot of confusion and inner discomfort
 unhone har kirdaar ke manarism ko bhi achche se pakadaa he
 The film becomes black and white by losing color in many places and this style enhances its effect
 10
 Do check out the Madras Cafe
 magar dhyaan rahe ki yah regular hindi film nahin he, ki isamen hero heroin honge
 They will have love, dance and dance and happy ending
 yah ek khunriji or seat par jakadakar baithaati suspence, ection thriller hai
 The good thing is that this one, like Tiger or Agent Vinod or other similar films, does not serve the very human form of the hero
 film insaanon kii tarah apni kahani baratati he, har rang ke saath
 The Madras Cafe is like a black coffee that may seem bitter to look at, but when it comes down from the floor, it gives a sense of consciousness
 aaj release hui film 'queen' kii kahani shuru hoti he, dilli ke ek ghar se, jahaan based parivaar main kangana ranavat, yani 'rani' kii shaadi kii taiyaariyaan chal rahi hai
 
 
 Meanwhile, suddenly, 'rani''s fiancée' Vijay 'calls her to a coffee shop to meet her and says that he does not want to marry' Rani '
 
 
 haalanki ye donon college ke dinon se hi ek-duusare ko pasand aa rahe hai, magar vijay kaa badla hua rup dekhakar sab gamazada ho jate hai, kyonki ye donon paris jaakar honeymoon manaane kaa plan bana chuke the, isliye shaadi tuutane ke baad bhi 'rani' akele hi honeymoon par paris chali jaati he, or yaheen se shuru hota he rani kaa 'honeymoon travel'
 
 
 Kangana Ranaut is really 'rani' in the film 'queen', which dominated the screen from the first frame to the last
 
 
 tuuti-phooti angrezi, dilli kii boli kaa lahaza, or middle class ladki ke haav-bhav ko kangana ne parde par bakhubi pesh kiya he
 
 
 Writer-director Vikas Bahl keeps an eye on every detail in the film
 
 
 'queen' ko aaj ke daur ke hisaab se banaaya gaya he, jisamen film ke plot se lekar screenple, dialog or chutkule tak, sab kuch tazaatreen lagate hai
 
 
 By the way, the casting of the rest of the characters of the film is also good, and Lisa Haydon has also added life to her small character
 
 
 film main kuch drishy aise bhi hai, jo shaayad darshakon ko atapate lagen
 
 
 Some of the scenes also look vulgar, even though they are portrayed in a funny way
 
 
 agar aap parivaar ke saath baithkar film dekh rahe hai, to aise drishyon par nazaren churaane ke liye majaboor ho jaaenge
 
 
 Even though the film has not left its grip, but i think the length of the film is a bit too much
 
 
 haalanki 'queen' bollywood kii masala film nahin he, phir bhi yah kisi anya masala film se kamazor bhi nahin he
 
 
 It has emotion, tragedy, comedy, and drama too
 
 
 kangana bhale hi honeymoon par akeli nikali hon, par darshak unke is safar se bor nahin honge
 
 
 So, my rating for this film is - 4 stars
 
 
 sonia gandhi kii beemaari ke chalate patari se utari congress ke prachaar kii gaadi ek baar phir upi main daudane ko taiyaar he

 In the political corridors of Uttar Pradesh, there is a loud publicity that the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Asaduddin Owaisi's party All India majlis-e-ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) elections in the state assembly elections in 2017
 Will fight haalanki, is bare main abhi tak donon main se kisi party ne is ore aadhikarik ghoshnaa nahin kii he, lekin philhal is sambhaavna ko lekar atakalon kaa bazaar garm he
 Many BSPK leaders have accepted that their party has an alliance with AIMIM in the state and only the announcement remains
 gauratlab he ki pehle charchaa thi ki bihar main mahagathbandhan kii tarj paraupi main sapa, bispi or duusare anya dal saath aa sakate hai
 Many SP leaders had also expressed interest in this direction, but then later the BSP ruled out the possibility of any such alliance

 While AIMIM is also excited about an alliance with the BSP to expand its party in UP
 yadi aisa hua to kai siton par dalit-muslim vot milakar pradesh main nai sarkaar ke gathan kaa sameekaran badal sakate hai
 According to sources, BSP chief Mayawati has secretly informed her party officials about this new alliance
 haalanki gathbandhan tay hone se kuch din pehle hi bispi nepradeshki kai siton par apane pratyaashee bhi ghoshit kar die
 The names of Owaisi announced that AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has already announced the names of candidates for the 2017 assembly elections in some seats in UP only after the coalition framework is ready
 yani agar gathbandhan hota he to jo siten eimm ko di jaaengi, vahaan se gathbandhan dharm ke tahat bispi pratyaashee ko hataa liya jayega
 It is believed that the BSP-MIM alliance will emerge as a major challenge for the ruling Samajwadi Party in the state

 naatak kii kahani ke centre main uma kaa charitra tha
 Uma whose personal personality is sacrificed to the orthodox rules of society
 uma likhnaa chaahati he, padhanaa chaahati he
 Uma's practice book reveals her innocence and innocence
 uski rachanaatmakataa or swatantraaa kii kaamana bhi uski pustika kaa hissaa he
 As the story progresses, Uma begins to wish the entire Indian women
 naatak kaa vishay striyon ko unki pahchaan or aazaadee die jane par jor detaa he
 Through theatricals, the artists today have attacked the girls like Uma and through them, they have attacked the customs, bonds and rituals of the society
 'khaataa' usee nariwadi manojgat kii supt padi cheekh he, jo paaramparik bhartiya samaaj ke khokhalepan ko ujagar karti he
 Uma is banned from reading and writing in the story, but then her mental feelings explode and she portrays the ocean of imagination and the hearts of women

 com / ha8qrx3nuq Syrian rebels captured a helipad near Damascus
 ek andolankaaree ne kaha ki yah syria shashan ke manobal par ek asardaar prahaar he
 The occupation claimed that the rebels were marching towards the capital
 unke paas hathiyaar hai or vah un rahon par aage bad rahe hai jahaan kabhi asad kii satta ko koi chunauti nahin de saktaa tha
 The rebels have been attacking airstrips in the northern areas of Syria
 britain aadhaarit sirian obserwetary ke raami abdul rahamaan ne kaha ki vidrohiyon ne marz al sultan ke shivi par kabja kar liya jisamen 15 vidrohi maare gayi or aath sainikon kii maut ho gayi
 “actually, the earthquake came on Saturday and from Sunday morning the Indian Air Force started evacuating people
 shuru main bijepi netaa emje akbar or baba ramdev jaise logon ko praathamikta di gai, lekin mangalvaar shaam tak tribhuvan airport par bhartiya sena ke jahaajon or sarvice planon ke kaaran vahaan kii vyavastha ast-vyast rahi, jiske kaaran nepali sena kaa bachaav kaary na keval prabhavit hua, balki kai deshon ke raahat se bhare saamaan bhi nahin pahunch paae
 At the meeting in Kathmandu, the representatives of every country do not forget to make the Indian officials realize that in a hurry to evacuate our people, we delayed the necessary relief material, which was more urgent
 '' Perhaps India and the media were more concerned about the images being made in India
 bukamp kii sari khabaren hamaare pradhanmantri ko centre main rakhkar kii jane lagi
 Further, if you have seen the coverage of Nepal earthquake while staying in India or through Indian channels, then you will feel that India has done it
 aapaki samaj kaa dayera simit hua hoga kyonki aap bahut kam jaan sake ki bharat ke alaava dusron ne vahaan kya kya kiya
 The result of this competition is that my inbox matches the Canadian embassy that Canada has increased its funding for Nepal
 canada vaale bhartiya media ko kyon bataa rahe hai
 The Chinese media CCTV, while researching the earthquake during prime time, also mentioned India's efforts in its articles
 sisitivi channel kii ankar ne apni pehali khabar main bharat ke prayaas ke bare main bataaya, phir china ke prayaas kii khabar thi
 India was also appreciated
 prime time main maine dikhaaya bhi tha ki kaise america, pakistan, israel, england, austrailia, japan vagairah kai desh nepal main raahat or bachaav kaary sanchalit kar rahe hai
 Many countries have also announced the resettlement plan and budget there
 nepal bukamp ko lekar bhartiya media kii khabaron kaa moolyankan to hona hi chahie
 TV does not come in the media
 akhbaar bhi aate hai
 But all the TV journalists reported bad, i do not agree with this
 isi sandarbh main moolyankan hamaari raajnneeti kaa bhi hona chahie ki kis tarah se madad ke prayaason kaa raajnneetikaran kiya gaya or puri duniya main bharat kii chhavi yaa kisi nai dhamak ke aagaaz ke rup main prachaarit kiya gaya
 a variety of competition has started, while our culture says that service is the ultimate religion but ultimate service is that which is selfless
 madad karnaa chahie par gaanv-gaanv jaakar gaaya nahin jaataa he
 The one who gets help from this gets angry first
 tippaniyan But in Nepal, the trend of Indian media going back on Twitter should not fall prey to condemning the media and the government
 maine sisitivi kaa udhaaharan diya lekin kya ham jaanate hai ki chini media ne nepal main aae bukamp ko kaise cover kiya
 While returning from Hyderabad on Saturday, an Air India aircraft found a newspaper called China Daily
 is akhbaar main ek puraa panna nepal main china kii madad par tha
 This report notes how the Nepalese public is welcoming the Chinese rescue team 'blue Sky Team'
 unhen chaay-pani or bhojan kara rahi he
 Only China is China in this report
 kya ham maane ki china kii media vahaan kii sarkaar kaa propeganda kar rahi he? We must criticize our government and our media, but i am not willing to believe that our media or our reporters made any bad reporting there
 hameshaa kii tarah zarur kuch kamiyaan rahi hongi
 But to assume that all the reporters were searching for news under government propaganda would be an injustice to their honesty
 dukhad to he ki hamaari media ko lekar is tarah se trend kar rahaa he lekin jaldi main ham yah na maan len ki jo twitor par trend kar rahaa he vahi antim satya he
 We all know that trend is also made on Twitter
 jo bhi he agar yah trend nepali janata kii bhaavana kaa pratinidhitiv karata he to bharat or uski media ko chintaa bhi kerani chahie
 There should also be an assessment of what kind of work India and other countries have done in Nepal
 kisne pehle kiya, is tarah ke sawaal dasvin kaksha ke hote hai jaise pehali mahila ipies koun he
 a mature democracy needs to know who did what and how much

 The news of Indian media about Nepal earthquake must be evaluated
 media main sirf tivi nahin aata he
 Newspapers also come
 lekin tivi ke saare patrakaron ne karaab reporting kii, main isse sahamat nahin hum
 It is in this context that our politics should also be evaluated as to how the efforts to help were politicized and propagated all over the world as a reflection of India's image or any new threat
 ek kism kii hode shuru ho gai, jabaki hamaari samskruti yahi kahati he ki seva param dharm to he magar param seva wo he jo niswaarth he

 bhaajapa ne bhartiya udyog parisangh ke sammelan main aaj congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke bhaashan par kaha ki vah ‘bhramit netaa’ or ‘modibhay’ se grasit najar aa rahe hai
 Party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said, a confused leader introduced his confused ideology, which no one could understand
 unki baton main ‘modibhay’ bhi saaf najar aa rahaa tha
 'javadekar said,' Rahul's speech shows that he is living in his own world
 unhen is baat kaa jawaab dena tha ki samprag ke nau saal ke shashan main kya hua, lekin unke bhaashan main bhrashtachar yaa mahangaai kaa koi ullekh nahin aayaa
 He was questioning instead of answering
 yah ek tarah se is baat kii sweekaarokti he ki itane saalon main kuch nahin kiya gaya
 Another BJP spokesperson, Nirmala Sitharaman, questioned why the Congress-led UPA government had not yet implemented Rahul's ideas
 tippaniyan He said, he is surprised that Rahul put so many ideas in his speech but why his party's own government did not implement those ideas
 bhaajapa ke ek or pravaktaa shahanvaj hossain ne is baat par khed jataayaa ki rahul bhrashtachar or manhagaai par kuch nahin bole
 "we were hoping that he would give his views on corruption and inflation, but he disappointed the country," he said
 rahul ‘pradhan’ (gram pradhan) ko shakti dene ke bare main to bole, lekin pradhanmantri ko shakti dene kii baat nahin kahi
 Shahnawaz on Wednesday alleged that UPA has two centers of power, in which UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi has real power and the Prime Minister has no power
 party pravaktaa prakaash javdekar ne kaha, ek bhramit netaa ne apni bhramit vichaardhaara ko pesh kiya, jise koi samaj nahin sakaa
 'modibhai' was also clearly visible in his talks
 ’ javdekar ne kaha, ‘rahul kaa bhaashan darshata he ki vah apni hi duniya main rah rahe hai
 He had to answer what happened during the upa's nine-year rule, but there was no mention of corruption or inflation in his speech
 jawaab dene kii bajaay vah sawaal kar rahe the
 It is a kind of confession that nothing has been done in all these years
 ’ bhaajapa kii anya pravaktaa nirmala sitaraman ne kataaksh kiya ki congress nit samprag sarkaar ne rahul ke vichaaron ko abhi tak lagu kyon nahin kiya
 The comments unhone kaha, vah hairaan he ki rahul ne apane bhaashan main itane saare vichaaron ko rakhaa lekin unki party kii khud kii sarkaar ne un vichaaron ko lagu kyon nahin kiya
 Shahnawaz Hussain, another BJP spokesperson, regretted that Rahul did not speak on corruption and expensive e
 unhone kaha, ham ummid kar rahe the ki vah bhrashtachar or mudrasphiti par apane vichaar rakhenge, lekin unhone desh ko niraash kiya
 Rahul spoke about giving power to 'pradhan' (village head), but did not talk about giving power to the Prime Minister
 shahanvaj ne buudhvaar ko aarope lagaaya tha ki samprag main satta ke do kendra bane hue hai, jisamen samprag adhyaksh sonia gandhi ke paas vaastavik shakti he or pradhanmantri ke paas koi shakti nahin he

 This case is from 30 April 1990 to 30 December 1991

 As part of its latest effort to gain access to pakistani-american terrorists, India has urged US authorities to hand over Headley to him "temporarily" for a year
 america ne hedli ke pratyrpan main aakshamata jataai jiske baad bharat ne yah aagrah kiya
 This request was made during the india-us Home Security Dialogue held in Washington last month

 After India's persistent pressure, the US hinted to negotiators that India could be given access to Headley for a second time so that it could obtain more information about the conspiracy to conduct the 2008 attacks
 ab tak america ne rana se poochtacha karne kaa koi avasar nahin diya tha

 bhartiya jaanchakarta maanate hai ki hedli or rana ke paas dher sari suchanaaen hai or unase poochtacha se mumbai hamale ke peeche kii sajeesh par zyada roshni padegi
 It is noteworthy that 51-year-old Headley has confessed to his crime in 12 cases of terrorism, including the Mumbai attack that killed 166 people
 baharhaal, usne america adhikariyon ke saath ‘pli bargen’ kar kiya tha jiske tahat usne aparaadh sweekaar karte hue jaanch main sahyog kii baat kahi thi

 a strong coalition at the state level is likely to win if all the popular votes received by different parties of the opposition in the latest assembly elections are combined

 If the votes of the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal are combined with the Congress votes in the 2017 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, then it gets around 51 per cent

 (surveykshan nitish ke you-turn se pehle kiya gaya tha, isliye endie ke aankadon ko kuch mukammal karne kii jarurat he)
 Secondly, based on estimates in the country's mood survey, the NDA includes those parties who voted in favor of President Ramnath Kovind and those who voted for Meira Kumar in the Grand Alliance

 After the court's decision, now Lalu Yadav will have to go straight from the court to jail
 bataa den ki isse pehle pehle lalu chaara ghotaale se jude maamalon main jail ja chuke hai
 In the year 2013 too, Lalu Yadav was convicted by a special CBI court in Ranchi in the Chaibasa scam of about Rs 38 crore
 faisle ke baad lalu yadav ko sidhe birsa munda jail bhej diya gaya
 During that time Lalu had demanded from the judge that he should pronounce the verdict at the same time, but the court gave the verdict on 3 October

 But, of course, an irrefutable argument can be given in favor of exploiting the economic and strategic potential of these islands by cleaning some land

 Partially opening the rest of the island may be considered, with 25 to 30 per cent of its area protected for forests and the Shompen tribe (population around 400), as it has been continuously protected as before
 isse singapore ke aakaar jitna ilaaka ranneetik tainatiyon sahit samgr vikaas kaaryon ke liye mukt or uplabdh ho jayega
 The other option may be to open the Little Andaman, which is as large as Singapore and is home to the Ongay tribe with a total population of about 100 people

 It would be no far-fetched to imagine another Singapore-like place in the Bay of Bengal, which would become the pivot to meet the economic development needs of the coastal states / countries bordering the Eastern Ocean, including Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand
 And coastal states like West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and their hinterland

 After 20 years, once again, Sanjay is desperate to steal some age from Dutt's life
 20 saal baad ek baar phir patharilii jail kii oonchi charadivari sanjay dutt kii aazaadee chhinane ko taiyaar he
 After 20 years, the law is ready for the last time to complete the incomplete punishment of Sanjay Dutt
 lakhon-karodon phans ke chahete munna bhai kii jindagi ke agle 42 maheene yani 1177 din ab aazaadee se dur jail kii deewari main katenge
 Now that's true
 yahi munna kii takadir he or yahi kanoon kaa aakhri faisla bhi
 But this truth, this fate is not just this decision
 iske peeche 20 saal puraani kahani he
 The story that started with 12 blasts and 257 deaths
 wo kahani jisamen pehla mode 19 april 1993 ko tab aayaa jab sanju baba tada kanoon ke tahat pakade gaye or jail gaye
 After this the process of bail and jail went on in installments and the installment ended in 18 months
 jabaki sazaa bhugatni thi 5 saal, yani kul 60 maheene
 So now the time has come to spend the remaining 42 months out of the same 60 months, that is, three and a half years
 ye saadhe teen saal kii sazaa karj he, 20 saal puraane us gunaah kii jo sanju baba ne kiya tha
 a crime that did not stop him even after 20 years
 filmi script par apana role nibhaate-nibhaate munnabhai naa jane kab or kaise asal jindagi main bhi hathiyaaron se khilne lage
 Not knowing when and how the story of Reel became the real story of Munnabhai, but Sanju Baba did not know that in films you can be a hit by playing a villain but in real life, you can try the villain and get bad
 ye 1990 ke baad kaa daur tha
 Sanjay Dutt was a hit formula for Bollywood
 1991-92 kaa vakt, firoz khan kii film 'yalgaar' kii shooting chal rahi thi
 a film in which Sanjay Dutt played a negative role
 ek aise shaks kii bhoomika jo aparaadh kii duniya kaa betaj badshaah tha
 It was the same period when Sanju Baba, who played the role of Don in the film, became a don of life
 aisa nahin tha ki wo jurm kii duniya ke don bananaa chaahate the lekin, filmon main don kii tarah haathon main moujar yaa phir automatic gan rakhana unhen bada lubhaata tha
 Now call it the result of the lines written on Sanjay Dutt's forehead or the effect of bad associations
 wo anderworld kii duniya se judate gaye or aisa jud gaye ki daag dhul naa sake
 Feroz Khan's film 'yalgar' was under shooting during 1991-92 and Sanjay Dutt visited Dubai several times during the shooting of this film
 isi dauraan dubai main hi sanjay dutt kii mulaakaat anderward don daaud ibrahim ke bhai anis ibrahim se hui
 The series of meetings grew and Munnabhai's relationship with the people of the underworld deepened
 pehle anis ibrahim, phir chota shakeel, abu salem or iske baad anderworld ke sabase bade don daaud ibrahim
 The shooting of 'yalgar' was completed
 23 aktubar 1992 ko film relies ho gai, lekin jo rishte dubai main kaayam hue the, wo barkaraar the
 In the coming days, Sanjay Dutt's bad luck building was going to stand on the foundation of those same relationships
 ye baat or thi ki khud sanju baba ko iskaa ilm nahin tha
 About a month and a half after the release of the film 'yalgar'
 6 disambar 1992 kii shakl main desh main sabase afsosna ghatana hui
 After this, the situation in India itself changed
 desh bhar main tanaav, dangon jaise halaat, maahaul achche nahin the, desh dar rahaa tha
 Sanjay Dutt was also scared in this environment
 saansad ke bete, bollywood ke bade sitare
 The fear was not to hit the target
 ye vakt janvari 1993 kaa tha
 Mumbai was also in the grip of riots
 desh ke halaat se sanjay dutt kaa darana to thik kaha ja saktaa he lekin, iske baad jo unhone kiya, wo dare hue insaan kaa kadam nahin balki staradam main duube ek sitare kii aisi harakat thi, jise bharat kaa kanoon katai maaf nahin karata
 Do not know why Sanjay Dutt called Anees Ibrahim to avoid this fear
 sanjay dutt ne kaha, 'mujhe yahaan dar lagata he
 Send an automatic gun for safety
 ' anis ne jawaab diya, 'kaam ho jayega
 As if everything was going on in film style
 sanju baba ne anderworld se rishton kii jo script likhi thi, ye seen usee kaa climex tha
 15 January 1993, 14th Road Khar, Mumbai Film Producer and Magnum Video owner Sameer Hingora's office
 isi daftar se sanjay dutt ne anderworld se rishton kii jo script likhi thi
 Sameer Hingora was sitting in his office when two people entered
 ye log the abu salem or baba chouhan
 Both of them told Sameer Hingora that Dawood Abraham's brother Anees has ordered that we meet you
 is par samir ne poocha ki kaam kya he? abu salem ne bataaya ki sanjay dutt ko hathiyaar dene he or isamen aapaki madad chaiye
 On hearing this, Sameer Hingora felt like a snake
 wo abhi jawaab soch hi rahe the ki thik usee vakt khud anis kaa phone aa gaya
 Anees said to Sameer, 'salem and Baba are my men
 ye dono hathiyaar se bhari gadiyaan laayenge
 You please take them to Sanjay Dutt
 sanjay ko kuch hathiyaar dene he
 Baba Chauhan and Salim will give the remaining weapons to the rest of the people
 ' ab to sachmuch samir ke hosh phakhta ho gayi
 He consulted his partner Hanif Kadawala in the same fashion
 sach jaanate hi hanif bigad gaya
 Then went away from his house and talked to Anees himself from a PCO and said that he could not do this work but the pressure of d-company increased so much that Sameer Hingora succumbed
 ye puri daastaan hingora ke tada court ke ikbaalia bayaan kaa hissaa he
 Later, when Sameer Hingora agreed to do the work of d-company, the work of Abu Salem and Bab Chauhan to reach arms to Sanjay Dutt became easy
 16 janvari 1993, mumbai kii ek shant subahashahar neend se jaagane kii taiyaari main tha, par ek shaks aisa tha jisaki neend hi udi hui thi
 This person was Sameer Hingora, who was to go to Sanjay Dutt's house with Abu Salem and Baba Chauhan to bring weapons
 samir subah 10:30 baje apane daftar pahunchaa
 Shortly afterwards, Abu Salem and Baba Chauhan also reached there in a blue Maruti van
 donon apni vine main baithe, jabaki samir apni gadee main baith gaya
 After this, all three of them drove straight to Sanjay Dutt's house
 sanjay ko inke aane kii khabar pehle se thi
 As soon as they came there, Sanjay Dutt warmed up to Abu Salem, both hugged
 iske baad sanjay dutt ne apane driver mohammad ko bulaayaa or kaha ki gairaaj se sari gadiyaan baahar nikaal lo
 After a while, Sanjay asked Abu Salem how many weapons were there
 salem ne bataaya ki 9 eke 56 or 80 grenade or gola barood hai
 Sanjay Dutt was shocked to hear this
 kehete hai ki sanju baba ne tab hero ke andaaj main kaha tha, 'are main itani rifl kaa kya karuunga, mere liye to bas ek hi kaaphi he
 After this, Abu Salem showed Sanjay Dutt a hand grenade, then Sanjay said that it is not right to keep them here, it can burst
 is par abu salem ne kaha ki isamen pin lagi he
 Salem then bombed the ground 2-3 times there and showed that the grenade would not explode until the pin was removed
 iske baad abu salem ne saare saamaan kii list banaai
 Zakhire had a total of nine AK-56 rifles, 80 hand grenades and 450 round cartridges
 sanjay dutt ne inamen se sirf ek eke-56 rifl lee or baaki abu salem ko lautaa di
 The whole story was narrated by Sameer Hingora and Baba Chauhan in the Tada court
 eke-56 lene ke baad kareeb 2 maheene tak sab thik rahaa
 But then on 12 March 1993, a serial blast took place in Mumbai and Sanju Baba's trouble started
 bhartiya team ke coach ke chayan par suspence philhal khatm ho gaya he
 Vinod Rai, chairman of the Supreme Court-appointed Advisory Committee (CAC), said on Monday that Kumble would continue to be the coach of the team for the West Indies tour

 purv test openar virendra sahvaag sahit desh-videsh ke 6 khilaadiyon ne team india kaa coach banane ke liye aavedan kiya he

 According to BCCI acting president CK Khanna, whoever becomes the coach of the Indian team, will remain with Team India till the 2019 World Cup

 Everyone asks on Friday 5
 koun si film dekhi
 How is it magar is baar aisa nahin hua
 i only asked that i did not ask
 to poocha sabane
 i told van bai tu dekhi
 Now listen, what are the answers? ye koun si film he
 Have you started reviewing English films too? 
 
 to sahiban pesh e khidamat he abhaya deol or priti desai kii film van bai tu kaa rivyuu, jiske bare main public baj ponpon yani bahut kam he
 And after watching the film i am sure that it will soon be included in the list of free movies with free dvds
 van bai tu devika bhagat kii film he
 Till now she used to write screenplays and story
 shuruyaat behad shandaar thi unki, film ‘manorama sicks feet under’ se
 Most of the people watched it on DVD, but again appreciated it
 uske baad devika ke khate main ain ‘aaysha’, ‘jab tak he jaan’ jaisi kuch filmein
 Seeing this list, it was expected that One by Two will not be like masala films
 kuch fundu hogi
 But 90 percent disappointment took place
 film main sirf ek hi cheez hatakar he
 Storytelling pattern, which breaks the default framework
 arase baad ek aisi film dekhi, jisamen hero heroin ko milaane kii hadabdaahat nahin he
 But apart from this, the film is full of scope, yet half of it seems incomplete
 ye kahani he do naujavaanon kii, amit sharma or samaara patel
 Amit is from Mumbai
 ek software prafational he
 Like every cool youngster during college days, playing guitar used to please girlfriends
 ab boring jindagi ji rahaa he, jisamen gam bhi jud gaya he kyonki uski garlfriend devika dich kar gai he
 That is, they have a whole reason for Buddha's philosophy 'life is sad'
 duusari ore samaara he, kamaal kii dancer he
 She lives with her mother suffering from alcohol addiction
 landan main pali badi he, isliye hindi bhi english lahaze main bolti he
 He has only one dream
 naach kii duniya main naam kamanaa
 The motives of both lives are engulfed in a mist, which finally clears up
 is dauraan donon jane anjaane ek duusare kii line katate hai or aakhri main milan kaa chauraahaa aata he
 These are the two Confuse people
 inke kuch dost hai
 There are some personal difficulties
 jinase bahut aahista aahista jujhate hai
 So dull that the film sits down
 chunki balak guitar bajaata he or nayika dance karti he isliye gaanon or naach ke liye sambhaavnaaon ke dwaar khule rahete hai
 And to meet the quota of laughter is the use of words like pony, foot
 abhaya deol puri film main kirdaar nibhaane ke pher main sust or boring se lage hai
 Ram Jaane, why did she choose to act and produce this film
 unki garlfriend bataai ja rahi british indian actress priti desai bahut acchhee dancer hai
 is that all
 aage aap kam likhe ko zyada samajhen
 The side actors have some interesting characters like Sisika or ACP Mama, but they cannot pull the film on their own
 film ke kuch gane sureele hai, magar west se hue lagate hai
 For example, Shankar Mahadevan sang ‘khushfahmiyan’ and Arijit Singh sang ‘khuda Na Khasta’
 inhen audio par jarur sunen
 i Am Just Pacod is made and shot on the lines of Delhi Belly's Ja Witch
 kaaboom bhi jabaran thuns diya gaya he
 One can see one by two, if not avoid watching dull movies
 agar khaae pie aghaae logon ke us darshan main romaaniat mahasoos hoti he ki ham kyon hai
 Why are they like this and why are they unable to accept us? 
 
 film tukdon main hansaati he
 She understands
 magar phul package ij just pakaod

 rafel deal ko lekar supreme court ke faisle par hangaamaa much gaya he
 Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan has termed the court verdict incorrect
 vahiin, sansad main congress, tiemasi samet puraa vipaksh jepisi kii maang par ada hua he
 Not only this, the Congress has tried to make the price of the planes an issue again
 congress kaa kahana he ki ham kabhi supreme court nahin gaye
 We have been demanding JPAC from the beginning
 court ke is faisle par vishleshkon kii raay he ki supreme court ne apane sanvaidhanik daayre main rahete hue faisla sunaaya he
 The court has not gone to the bottom of the case
 jis kaaran vivaad tha yani benchmark prise ke maamle main court ne dakhal dene se hi manaa kar diya he
 On November 15, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged, "prime Minister Narendra Modi went against the opinion of the officers, the defense minister and the Defense Procurement Council
" Benchmark prize (base price) Increased from Rs
 39,422 crore to Rs
 62,166 crore
 bijepi benchmark prise ko badhaakar anil ambani kii company reliance dephence ko phayda pahunchaa rahi he
 During this time Surjewala demanded GPC
 aaj court ne benchmark prise ko lekar koi faisla nahin sunaaya
 The court said that it is not our job to see the cost of the aircraft
 yani court ne us congress ke us aarope par koi faisla nahin sunaaya
 What can Congress do now? Even after the decision of the Supreme Court, the Congress has not come on the backfoot
 congress shuru se hi benchmark prise ko lekar aarope lagaati rahi he
 At the same time it has been demanding the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate this
 court ke faisle ke baad congress or puraa vipaksh phir se jepisi kii maang kar rahi he
 Supreme Court Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi dismissed all the petitions, saying that there is no doubt in the Rafale deal
 rafel kii gunvattta ko lekar koi sawaal nahin he
 We have read the entire process of the deal
 vimaan desh kii jarurat he
 It is not our job to see the price of the aircraft
 ham sarkaar ko aadesh nahin de sakate hai ki vah kitne vimaan kharidegi
 The court defended the purchase of the aircraft, the court found the central government's move correct under which the deal was signed with France to purchase 36 fighter aircraft
 saath hi vimaanon kii keemat se sambandhit jaankaree saarvajanik karne kii maang kaa virodh kiya gaya tha
 The largest court also said that we cannot force the government to buy 126 aircraft
 hamen aisi koi saamagree nahin mili, jisase lage ki galat tareeke se kisi khaas company ko phayda pahunchaaya gaya
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi has been directly attacking the Prime Minister regarding the 'chowkidar Chor Hai' Rafale Deal

 Commenting on the question raised by Prashant Bhushan, advocate Prashant Bhushan gave a statement that the Supreme Court has said that there is no need for any investigation on the Rafael Deal on the basis of the evidence
 court ne saude se judi prakriya or keemton par santushti jataai he, lekin mere mat ke anusaar, supreme court kaa faisla puri tarah se galat he
 They ignored our arguments
 in logon ne daakhil kii thi yachikarafelmaamle main sabase pehle vakil emel sharma ne supreme court main yachika daakhil kii thi
 Hearing his plea, on October 10, he had said that within 10 days the complete process of the Rafale deal should be provided
 phir court ne silband lipaphe main rafel vimaanon kii keemat bhi maangi thi
 After ML Sharma, on 8 October, Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh of Aam Aadmi Party and then on 24 October Prashant Bhushan jointly with Arun Shourie and Yashwant Sinha filed a petition on the same issue
 ab sabhi yachikaaon ko supreme court ne khaarij kar diya he

 2003 kaa saal tha
 Dilip Singh Judeo was stinged by India Today Group and Express
 un par bhrashtachar ke aarope lag rahe the
 One of his statements was very good that money is not God but not less than God
 isi vivaad ke sandarbh main judev mere saath baat kar rahe the
 With my style in Raipur, i put my hand on my shoulder and went away
 wo hissaa pehle padhie
 The original Hindi statement was not found, but an English translation was found on the Internet, which i am again presenting by translating Hindi
 "aapako dharmantaran rokane ke liye sena kii zarurat hogi
 Challenges can come and time is also short
 maan lijie koi rasad detaa he, ise galat samajha gaya he
 Who will pay his bill jab chandrashekhar azaad or bhagat singh lard rahe the tab birla ji mahatma gandhi ke paas jate the
 Where did they bring the logistics from? (18 november ke indian express main chapa he) Dilip Singh Judeo was a BJP MP and was then named as a candidate for Chief Minister
 ab is duniya main nahin hai
 i went to cover the election for the first time
 judev ke is bayaan ke baad kaaphi hangaamaa machaa tha or ve naaraaz ho gaye the magar tab tak der ho chuki thi
 His statement was fast received on our channel
 pradhanmantri modi par rahul gandhi ne jab suut boot kii sarkaar kaa aarope lagaaya tha tab suut unhone hi pahana tha, rahul gandhi ne nahin
 His name was written on that suit
 itani jaldi ek netaa ke liye naam vaala suut material ban jaae or sil jaae, kamaal kii baat he
 It is a matter of hobby or special relationship, history will never be known because the Prime Minister will never tell
 wo isliye unhen koi haraa nahin saktaa or 2024 tak ve hi pradhanmantri hai
 He said the same thing while speaking in the Lok Sabha during a no-confidence motion
 pradhanmantri kaa wo suut nilaam kar diya gaya
 Rahul Gandhi had alleged that the suit is the government of the boot, but it got so much effect that the matter never happened again
 aaj ke jawaab ke hisaab se unhen apane us khaas suut kii nilaamee nahin kerani chahie thi
 When the namo can become the brand's kurtas and jackets, why can't the Prime Minister wear the suit written by Namo
 suut pahanakar ve parde ke peeche nahin the, sabake saamne aae the
 Barak was also next
 pradhanmantri lakhanu vaale is bhaashan main amar singh ko sakshi banaaya he
 Amar Singh is so relevant, who is sitting in the Prime Minister's House, who openly says in a TV interview that i am a broker
 dalal
 i was shocked
 un aadarneey amar singh ko sakshi banaakar pradhanmantri kehete hai ki amar singh yahaan baithe hai, sabaki history nikaal denge
 In the same way, he made Mehul Bhai a witness in Mumbai
 jo ab antiga ke naagarik ban chuke hai
 The Prime Minister was telling that the buyer checks the goldsmith in his village even after buying from the big goldsmith
 bank par bharosa nahin karata or saamne baithe mehul bhai kii tarah ishaara karte hue kehete hai ki "hamaare mehul bhai yahaan baithe hai lekin wo jayega apane sunar ke yahaan
 "the Prime Minister can do the game of talking by making Amar Singh and Mehul Bhai a witness
 ye khel unheen ko aata he
 During the no-confidence motion, Rahul Gandhi has accused him of being a partner
 ve aarope hai rafael deal ke thik pehle anil ambani apni company banaate hai or us company ko hazaron karod kaa qaraar miltaa he
 Therefore, the price of Rafale fighter aircraft is not being reported
 rahul ke aaropon ke sandarbh main maalya, neerav modi, mehul chaukasee bhi hai
 Rahul said that the watchman has become a partner
 pradhanmantri iskaa sidhaa jawaab de sakate the
 But there will be guilt somewhere in his mind that his relationship with industrialists is tightened
 udyogpatiyon ke saath yaa ek do udyopati ke saath tanj hota he, ye aap jaanate hai
 But one looks beautifully with two industrialists and turns them on beautifully
 ve is tarah se pesh karte hai jaise vipaksh yah kahata ho ki pradhanmantri ko udyogpatiyon ke saath dikhnaa hi nahin chahie
 By not responding to these allegations, the Prime Minister takes his image to the image of Gandhi and Birla's relations
 sawaal he ki sadak par gadde kyon hai, jawaab main modi ji kah rahe hai ki pehle chand dekho
 Look at that moon
 vipaksh us daag ko gadde bataa rahaa he
 He has no qualms in avoiding the real question
 unhone yah kah diya ki ve udyogpatiyon se sabake saamne photo khinchane se parhez nahin karte magar sawaal to kuch or tha
 If he had answered that question, perhaps his answer would not have collided with Judeo's answer 15 years ago
 tippaniyan But in this sequence, he was not replying to Rahul, but was repeating the answer given by Dilip Singh Judeo after 15 years
 niyati sirf haar or jeet ke din nahin hoti, wo jeet ke baad bhi apana khel khelti rahati he
 Judeo also uses Gandhi and Birla's relations as a shield and Modi also uses Birla and Gandhi's relations
 jab bhi bachaana hota he gandhi kaam aa jate hai

 That is why no one can beat him and by 2024 he is the Prime Minister

 The Prime Minister's suit was auctioned
 rahul gandhi ne aarope hi lagaaya tha ki suut boot kii sarkaar he, magar itnaa asar ho gaya ki dobaaraa us suut kii baat kabhi nahin hui
 According to today's answer, they should not have auctioned that particular suit

 You know, it is tighter with industrialists or with one or two entrepreneurs
