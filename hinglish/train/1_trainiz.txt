 com / zn3x0rohmt — Shubham Shinde 💥 (@ Shubham631997) December 1, 2017 From a feud with Vikas Gupta to a friendship with Akash and Arshi Khan and then Patch with Vikas, Shilpa has always been a homegrown Contestant
 iske alaava naa sirf vikaas ko maaf karne par balki gharavaalon ke prati hameshaa madadgaar rahane vaali shilpa ne ne apni isi adaa ke chalate darshakon ko divaana banaaya
 Not only this, when many family members made a lot of allegations against Shilpa together, her quiet attitude was seen
 yahaan tak ki big bos 11 se baahar huin benaphsha ne bhi instagram par shilpa se apane vyavhaar ke liye maafee maangi
 Everytime Salman would joke around and say "ben jaa rahi hai", there was one person along with Priyank who would cry secretly
 However, the time i actually went out i hurt her so much that she didn't even shed a tear
 Akash and Arshi were not the only ones who called her Shilpa ma, throughout the journey we had a distant but lovely relationship, and i WISH so bad that i could take the last week back when i was mean to her
 i don't care about people hating and saying i completely changed sides after coming back, had i known how much you and Vikas looked out for me in the show, the wrong things would've never happened
 It takes a lot to apologize and accept mistakes, and i was in tears when i saw how much you cared
 Still wish i could come and just hug you and say sorry once, that would be enough redemption

 Where people from all over the world take a dip in the Ganges and wash away sins

 a serial killer named Kalua Patel aka Sai Baba had arrived at the Kumbh Mela to wash away sins
 police ne usko pakad liya
 He confessed to the crime and said that last year he has murdered 10 people
 uttar pradesh ke lalapur main usne logon ko maut ke ghat utaara tha
 Most of whom were laborers
 usne isliye maaraa tha kyonki wo uskaa majaak banaate the
 SSP Nitin Tiwari told TOI- 'we were searching for Kalua Patel for a long time
 'operation serial killer' ke vakt ham usko dhund rahe the
 Regular checking was going on at Kumbh Mela on Friday
 usee vakt police ke saamne se ek shaks kulhadi or dhardaar hathiyaar haath main liye nikal rahaa tha
 When questioned by the police, it was found that he had killed 10 people in the last 6 months
 'esaspi nitin tiwari ne kaha- 'kalua patel ne ab tak bataaya he ki usne 4 july ko do majdoor kidaganj ke durga puja park main, daraganj main ek majdoor ko 27 november ko, ek majdoor ko 24 disambar ko kothaa parchaa main maaraa

 ' kalua ne bataaya ki wo log bhadde coment karte the or uske saath acha vyavhar nahin karte the isliye unako maaraa gaya
 He targeted those people while they were sleeping on the side of the road
 police kaa kahana he ki uskaa maansik santulan thik nahin he
 The police is still questioning him
 usne bataaya ki wo logon ko raat main maaraa karata tha
 Because in the desert he used to run away after hunting and no one could see him

 According to Aggarwal, a formal notice has been given to the Punjab government in this regard
 bibiembi ne punjab sarkaar ko suchit kiya he ki is saal zyada barf pighalane or monsoon ke jaldi aane se nadiyon main pani kaaphi zyada maatra main aa rahaa he
 If the same situation prevails, water will have to be released from Bhakra Dam and Pong Dam

 Agarwal said that either the Punjab government should remove the encroachment in the area of the rivers or be prepared for the flood situation
 asal main is saal pahari ilaakon main pichley 23 saalon main sabase zyada barf padi he yah barf teji se pighalkar nadiyon main aa rahi he
 Also, the monsoon has also rained a lot of water ahead of time
 lihaaja sabhi nadiyon main pani ufaan par he
 At present, Bhakra Dam has 1930 feet of water, which is 84 feet above last year
 jabaki beas nadi par bane pong baandh kaa jal str pichley saal ke mukaable 48 feet upar he
 In such situations, water may have to be released from the Bhakra and Pong Dam, but the situation is even more worrying that there is no space left to carry this water in the rivers
 bibiembi ke chairman e
 According to B
 Agarwal, at this time people have encroached on the banks of the Sutlej and Beas rivers all over Punjab
 kahin nadi ke andar tak mitti daal kar khet bana die gaye hai to kahin to nadi ke bich hi rihaayshi coloniyaan kaati gayi hai
 Aaj Tak also reached a seasonal river passing through Nayagaon in Mohali district

 The river has collapsed into a drain
 agar is mausam main baari barsaat hogi to yah pani kahaan jayega? jaahir he nadi main rasta na milane par upar se aane vaala pani insaani ilaakon main hi ghusega
 Both Sutlej and Beas rivers had a capacity of 5 to 7 lakh cusecs of water 20 to 30 years ago
 yani itnaa pani inke kinaaron ke andar se aaraam se bahakar nikal jaataa tha, lekin pichley kuch saalo main in nadiyon main agar mahaj 70 hajaar kusek se zyada pani chhod diya jaae to punjab main baadh jaise halaat paidaa ho jate he
 Water flows out of the river
 nadi ke kinare pehle ke mukaable sankare ho gaye hai
 The BBMB says that we have told the Punjab government, we will release water in a controlled way, but if more water comes, our hands will stand up
 bibiembi punjab se bahane vaali sutluj, beas or raavi nadiyon kaa prabandhan karata he
 Bhakra, Pong and Ranjit Sagar dam built on these generates electricity
 iske jalaashyon main saal bhar pani ikattha hota he lekin, agar pani zyada ho jaae to baandh kii suraksha ke liye use chhodana bhi padataa he
 Now whatever the Bhakra dam management says, the Punjab government has an answer ready
 kyonki nadi kinaaron par jo kabje ho rahe hai wo jameen sarkari nahin he privet he, lihaaja sarkaar kya kare

 ) It is an election year, but the onion in Delhi has been shedding tears for many months without cutting back
 thok mandi main pyaaj ke bhav 55 rupee tak hai
 In the retail market, onion prices are on the sky
 khudara bazaar main pyaaj kahin-kahin 70 rupee kilo se bhi zyada main bik rahaa he
 The surprising thing is that onion is over 70 and the government is sleepy
 pyaaj par dilli main haahaakaar he or sarkaar ko ab bhi raahat dene kaa intjaar he
 But it seems that the concern of the Delhi government is only the tears of the crocodile after seeing the tears of Delhi
 kyonki pyaaj kii keemton par hallaa dekh sasta pyaaj bechney vaali sarkaar ne ab apni dukaane band kar di hai
 It is reported that onions were to arrive in Delhi from China and Pakistan earlier this month
 lekin ye pyaaj ab tak nahin aayaa
 As a result, onion prices have caught fire once again

 Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje's priority since taking charge of Rajasthan for the second time in December 2013 was to improve the methods of governance with the help of private sector
 rajya main bhayanak kuprabandhan kii shikaar jan vitaran pranali or isaki saste rashan kii dukaanon kaa kayakalp unki aguai main ab shuru ho chukaa he
 Raje took the first bold step to increase the number of beneficiaries of subsidized wheat to 1 under the National Food Security Act, 2013
 2 karod par pahunchaa diya he
 For this, the beneficiaries were reviewed and the ineligible beneficiaries were shortlisted by Ashok Gehlot's Congress government just before the assembly elections
 isaki bajaae un 20 lakh logon ko labhaarthiyon main joda gaya he jo chhot gaye the
 896 crores to the state exchequer from this exercise
 kii bachat hui he
 According to Raje, "we want every eligible citizen to be entitled to one penny for himself
" unhen chhaant diya jaae jo galat tareeke se yah paisa paa rahe hai or un logon kaa pataa lagane ke tareeke khoje jaaen jo vanchit hote hue bhi is yojana se maharoom hai
 In this review, an administrative officer was also found to be registered as a beneficiary
 aise logon kii sankhya chah jilon kii aabaadi se bhi zyada pai gai
 a pilot study conducted in Kotkasim in Alwar district in the case of Karsan alone resulted in 94 per cent of the total recorded beneficiaries and a total of 1 in the state
 56 karod labhaarthiyon main se 40 lakh ke naam suchi se hataa die gaye
 "this has helped to increase the quota of eligible beneficiaries from the earlier three liters to four liters," says Subodh Aggarwal, Principal Secretary, Food and Civil Supplies Department
 '' unke mutabik, is saal ke ant tak digital card taiyaar ho jane ke baad 20 lakh jaali rashan cardon kii chuttee ho jaaegi
 These digital ration cards will be linked to Point of Sale (POS) machines installed at 25,000 cheap ration shops, of which 9,000 are operational
 iske jariye kota jari karne ke liye labhaarthi ke aadhaar biomitrix kaa sahaara liya jayega
 It will also be made online elsewhere and within three years the availability of the dealer will also be online
 dealron ke ek dhade ne dharne-pradarshan ke jariye is pahal kaa virodh kiya he or sarkaar ko kuchhek prastaavon par peeche hatane ko baadhya kiya he, jinke tahat computer sakshar snaatakon ko dealer rakhaa janaa tha
 But Raje has started another project in the case of cheap ration shops
 ve kahati hai, ''andhere konon main bani, keval teen anaaj dene vaali or lambii kataron ko jamaa karne vaali aisi choti dukaanon kii jagah ham inhen mini departmental store banane kii koshish main hai, jisase inke maalikon kii aay main ijapha ho or doordaraj main rahane vaale upabhoktaaon ko bhi umdaa utpaada mil saken
 "the government is not investing in this work
 uski bhoomika keval madhyasth kii he
 Under this, 25,000 cheap ration shops will be named Annapurna Stores and there will be 225 to 350 branded products including pulses, rice, soap, everyday items which can compete with private retail shops
 iske liye do baar boli mangvayi ja chuki he or akele kishor biyani kii future kanjumar enterprijej ko 5,000 dukaanon kaa theka mil gaya he
 The state's Food and Civil Supplies Corporation is supporting Future's Aadhaar Wholesale Trading and Distribution to implement the Annapurna project successfully
 saal bhar pehle aadha darjan dukaanon par kiye gaye prayogon ke nateezon kii samiksha ke baad 31 aktubar, 2015 ko raaje ne is yojana kaa udghaatan kiya
 So far, 80 cheap ration shops have been converted into Annapurna stores and it is targeted to expand it to 5,000 shops by June
 rajya main future samooh ke das big bazaar maujuud hai, jiskaa akele kiraanaa kaarobaar main 35 karod ru
 Turnover of the year
 iske maalik kishor biyani kaa lakshya aise upabhoktaaon ko apane se jodpha he jinhen gunvatttapurna utpaada kharidne ke liye lanbaa safar karnaa padataa he
 Retailers of cheap galleries through Annapurna earn Rs 7,000
 masik se doguna karne kii raaje kii yah yojana agar kaamyaab ho jaati he, to biyani ko 5,000 dukaanon se big bazaar kii kamai kaa 20 guna kaarobaar mil paaegaa
 For this, each side has to be patient, as the owners of ration shops have become accustomed to monopoly and do not have the skills to sell goods to low-income consumers
 inamen se zyaadaatar maal bhale hi paramparaagat dukaanon se mahangaa hoga par big bazaar se sasta padegaa
 The government is encouraging retailers to get around one lakh rupees to get their first shipment of goods, including decorating the shops
 kaa nivesh karen
 Questions are being raised as to why a government is helping one business house to become the only supplier and why the owners of cheap ration shops are taking away the freedom to buy and sell cheap goods from anywhere? Aggarwal says that cheap galleries are seen as government shops, so it is the responsibility of the state to sell goods of a certain quality and this can be done through a single distributor
 iske alaava ve asangathit kshetra main hai isliye unke paas paryaapt sansaadhan or udhyam nahin hoga ki ve alag-alag holcelleron ke paas jaakar gunvatttapurna maal kharid saken
 Some retailers are excited about the sale but there are others who anticipate that it will take a long time to recover their costs
 future samooh ke prabharee or varisht prabandhak manish pari ne annapurna yojana ke retailleron ke liye yah kaam aasaan bana diya he
 They do not charge 18 per cent interest if the payment is pending for more than ten days, despite it being Rs 62 lakh
 ke maal kii aapurti ho chuki he or 18 lakh ru
 Recovery is still pending ve bache hue maal ko uthaakar uski jagah teji se bikne vaala maal rakh dete hai
 It is worth noting that according to the study done by India Today, the choice of consumers in the 60 km radius around Jaipur in Rajasthan varies on a few kilometers
 bhambhori gaanv main 55 varshiya suresh kumaar sharma kii annapurna dukaan kaa locarpan raaje ne 31 aktubar ko kiya tha
 There are 350 types of goods here
 ve bikri ko lekar khush hai
 Consumers are buying Dove soap from their shop
 phulera ke 40 varshiya gaurikant kehete hai ki ve us jagah se annapurna ke utpaada nahin bech sakate jahaan ve kiraasana or gehun bechate the, kyonki vahaan kaaphi gandh or dhul he
 So they have opened the Annapurna store in the hallway room in front of their new house, 100 yards away
 haalanki unhone iske liye sujhaayaa sarkari rang ab tak nahin istemaal kiya he
 Yet his shop is far better than the tin-shed shop of the elderly Ram Niwas Bairwa in Majumabad in Dudu block where he had to open a shop because the landlord was demanding more rent for Annapurna's shop
 bairava ke 1,500 graahak hai jinamein kai bahut dur se aate hai
 Only a few of them buy Annapurna's products and Bairava does not even remember their prices because the first list they got was in English
 iske alaava pados main hi ram narayan choudhary kii ek or annapurna dukaan he jiske kaaran bairava kii bikri kam rahati he
 Chaudhary says that they have to keep tobacco products to attract customers who want their sachets instead of Fair & Lovely's tubes and demand cheaper brushes than Gillette's shaving brushes
 annapurna ke zyaadaatar dukandaaron kii maang he ki unhen chini bhi di jaani chahie lekin sarkaar ko dar he ki rasanaki chini ko annapurna main bechaa ja saktaa he, isliye annapurna main chini nahin bechney di ja rahi he
 Rashmi Devi says that it is easy for her to buy some items from Annapurna's shop located in Shivaji Nagar, Jaipur, while the consumer of cheap ration like Kamala Saini finds Annapurna's goods expensive
 jab simit aay par jeena hi chunauti ho, to aise main gunvattta kaa sawaal peeche chalaa jaataa he
 Raje has to take seriously these political allegations that why she is selling expensive goods to the poor? Biyani believes that those customers will welcome the Annapurna store, who want to buy quality products, but for which they have to go to the city because such products are not available in their village or town
 raaje kaa yah kaam kaaphi bada or mushkil bharaa he kyonki 5,000 dukaanon ko har hafte maal pahunchane ke liye aadha darjan godaamon se gadipoon ko 1,200 chakkar lagane honge
 Families of many ration shop owners are also being added to this work, but the government fears that many ration people will either not come or will leave
 isiilie usne saste galle or annapurna kii dukaanon ke liye shikshit or icchhuk ummidavaaron ko rakhe jane kaa prastaav diya he
 600 crores by 2017, Food and Civil Supplies Department Rs
 turnover kii ummid kar rahaa he
 Out of this, one crore rupees
 vah brands ke prachaar or ritalleron ke kalyaan par kharch kar sakegaa
 It is also planned that when the price of canned material goes up, it can be sold cheaply from Annapurna shops
 raaje ko ummid he ki sarkaar kii ore se protsaahit yah vitaran pranali jamini str par khudara bazaar main kayapalat karne vaali sabit hogi
 But this is possible only when Biyani can change the habits of these customers
 jan vitaran kshetra main is tarah ke sudhaar yaa prayog karne ke maamle main rajasthan sabase aage najar aa rahaa he
 In the past, the Chhattisgarh and Karnataka state governments had allowed consumers to buy cheap cuttings from shops that were not registered for them
 kam se kam das fisadi dukaanon main pioes mashin seva ko lagu karne main rajasthan ko net connactivity kii samasya se jujhna hoga
 Rajasthan is the only state to have started the Annapurna retail chain
 yahaan jald hi yaa phir baad main sanshodhan karke rashan card dukaan retaillers ke liye umr seemaa bhi tay kii jaaegi
 The children of such shopkeepers will not be able to transfer these shops directly
 aisa lag rahaa he ki sarkaar kii ore se dabaav kii ye tarkiben sunishchit karengi ki rashan dukaanon ke maalik annapurna yojana ko apanaaen

 Hyderabad police on Thursday registered a case against senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh for comments made on the fake website of the terrorist organization Islamic State (IS)

 The police have registered a case against Digvijay under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for disseminating material spreading terror among the people, deliberately creating an atmosphere of warning for people in distress and making a confusing statement to the people

 Digvijay had tweeted that the Telangana Police has created a fake IS website, which is radicalizing Muslim youths and motivating them to join IS
 digvijay ne agle twit main kaha tha ki mudda yah he ki telugana police ko bhadakaau suchanaaen prasaarit kar aies se judane ke liye prerit muslim yuvaaon ko fansaana chahie? kya yah nyyochit he? kya yah naitik he? kya mukhyamantri ke
 Chandrasekhar Rao has empowered the Telangana police to motivate Muslim youths to join IS and then implicate them? If they have done so, should they not take responsibility for it and resign from the post? If they have not done so, they should not investigate and punish them for committing such heinous crime? Police said they would call Digvijay for questioning if needed
 telugana main congress ke party maamalon ke prabharee digvijay ko is tippanee ko lekar telugana sarkaar se kadi aalochana jhelni padi
 The TRS government of Telangana has asked Digvijay to unconditionally withdraw his charges or give relevant evidence

 bagpat jail main mafia don munna bajrangi kii hatya dushmani ke chalate kii gai yaa kisi sajeesh kaa hissaa he
 Is Munna Bajrangi really murdered by Sunil Rathi? Was anyone other than Sunil Rathi involved at the time of the murder? Was the murder done at the behest of someone? Is this the game of any person in the government system? All these questions have been circulating in everyone's mind since the death of Munna Bajrangi
 do tasviren, dheron antarlekin ajtak ke haath hatya ke thik baad khinchi munna bajrangi kii do aisi tasviren lagi hai, jo is hatyakand kaa raaj kholane main ahm suraag sabit ho saktaa he
 The evidence that we will show in these two pictures of Aaj Tak's hand will shake your mind
 pehali tasviir jahaan hatya ke baad turant khinchi lag rahi he, vahiin duusari tasviir kaaphi der baad kii he
 In the first picture taken immediately after the murder, Munna Bajrangi is lying on the ground and a bullet mark appears from the top of the vest in the middle of his chest
 is tasviir main munna bajrangi ke sharir se nikal rahaa khun bilkul taaja lag rahaa he
 It is clear that this picture was taken just after the shoot
 sharir par or farsh par pade khun kii rangath bataa rahi he ki taaja-taaja goliyaan maari gai hai
 It is also clear from this picture that someone has taken this picture by standing near the dead body, that too immediately after firing
 vahiin duusari tasviir munna bajrangi kii hatya ke kuch der baad kii lag rahi he, yani munna bajrangi ko goli maare kuch vakt biit chukaa he
 See evidence of blood splattered on the body and ground as evidence
 khun jamana shuru ho chukaa he or uski rangath thodi kaali pad chuki he
 According to forensic science, as the time of death passes, the color of blood starts changing
 wo surkh laal se katthi or phir lagbhag kaala pad jaataa he
 Increased bullet marks, but the similarity in both pictures is that the position of the corpse has not changed
 munna bajrangi ke haathon kii pojishan pehali or duusari donon tasveeron main ek jaisi he
 But the surprising thing is that in the first picture where only one bullet mark is seen in the chest of Munna Bajrangi, in the second picture three marks of the bullet are seen
 pehali tasviir main munna bajrangi ke seene ke bichobich baniyaan ke upar se goli maari gai lag rahi he, lekin sharir main kahin or goli kaa nishaan nahin dikh rahaa he
 But in the second picture, there is a mark of a bullet shot in the middle of the chest, in addition to this there are two marks of a bullet shot on the side of the chest as well
 in donon tasveeron ko dekhne ke baad saaf lag rahaa he ki pehali tasviir khinchne ke baad munna bajrangi ko kam se kam teen goliyaan or maari gayi
 After this, another picture was clicked again
 duusari tasviir main dikh rahi goliyon ke nishaan se yah bhi saaf lag rahaa he ki baad main maari gai goliyaan munna bajrangi ke seene se bilkul sataakar maari gayi
 Because the gunpowder from the shot fired is clearly visible on the body of the deceased
 aisa tabhi hota he jab goli zyada se zyada aadha feet kii duuri se chalaai gai ho
 That is, Munna Bajrangi was shot first, the photo was taken
 iske baad maut ko pukhta karne ke liye phir se kam se kam teen goliyaan maari gayi or phir se tasviir khinchi gai
 Both these pictures raise many questions about the killing of Munna Bajrangi -: - Why was the first picture taken? - What was the purpose of taking the photo of the corpse after the murder? - Was the killer shot the first photo of Munna Bajrangi's body, Or was there someone else? - Did the killer send the first picture to someone? - Did the killer who sent the first photo ordered Munna Bajrangi to shoot more bullets? - Did the killer C
 gesture tot Bjrn Gee was murdered - killed time, according to information was not Lgasisitivikam near the barracks
 kya aisa jaanboojhkar kiya gaya tha, yaa yah sirf jail prashasan kii laaparvaahee he?- jis tarah se hai security barrack main hatyare ne goli markar photo khinchi, isse saaf he ki wo puure itminan main tha ki kaam hone tak use koi pakadaney nahin aayega
 So, was the prison administration or the man in the system involved with the killer? - Taking pictures after the murder, then taking more shots and taking another picture makes it clear that the killer was in contact with someone
 to kya vaaki ye maamla contract kiling kaa he?- yaa kahin sarkari mashinari ne hi munna bajrangi ko sochi samajhi sajeesh ke tahat thikaane to nahin lagavaaya?munna bajrangi kii patni ne kendriya mantri par lagaaya hatya karwaane kaa aropamunna bajrangi kii hatya ko lekar tamaam shaq isliye bhi uth rahe hai, kyonki munna bajrangi kii patnisima sinhane chand dinon pehle hi press conference karke upi estf par aarope lagaaya tha ki wo munna kii hatya kara sakate he
 Both the photographs after the murder of Munna Bajrangi, which is held by Aaj Tak, indicate very clearly in which Sunil Rathi, the accused of murder, from jail administration to UP police are all under suspicion
 ab dekhnaa ye he ki koi bhi jaanch is hatya ke sach ko baahar laa paata he yaa nahin? The trend of Indian films being released at the overseas box office has been increasing rapidly over time
 aamir khanki dangal or sikret superstar jaisi filmon ne jab duusare deshon main apana paracham laharaaya to baaki filmon ke mekars kaa dhyaan bhi is taraf gaya
 As a result, there was a rush to release his films in other countries besides India
 videshon main kis baat par nirbhar karata he bhartiya filmon kaa munafa?aisi kya vajah he ki mekars apni film ko bharat ke alaava or bhi deshon main relies karnaa chaahate hai? aakhir isse kya phayda hota he or us phaayde kii sambhaavna kitni prabal hoti he? darasal bhartiya filmon ko hone vaala munafa videshon main relies hui film ke chalane or vahaan inhen relies kiye jane ke baad hone vaale profit par lagane vaale tex ke aadhaar par tay hota he
 Low competition and big fan following benefit: America has far fewer films released in India
 saath hi vahaan par bharatiyon kii aabaadi bhi acchhee khaasi he
 This is the reason that the chances of the film running there are more and the competition with other films is also less
 iske alaava har ek desh main kisi na kisi bhartiya kalakaar kii acchhee khaasi fain folowing he jiskaa logon ko phayda miltaa he
 The stars have a fan following and emotional story as the key factor, like Aamir Khan has a good fan following in China, in the same way people in Arab countries are crazy about Shahrukh Khan
 america main log amitabh bachchan ko kaaphi pasand karte hai
 In such a situation, there is an advantage of releasing a film of a particular artist in these countries

 Therefore, the audience wants to see them

 In Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, in order to cool the stern stance of the Congress, the ruling BJP created such a chord that the Congress spoke in the House
 bijepi ne NSUI ke rashtriya adhyaksh ferroz khan par lage yon shoshan ke aaropon kii jaanch police ko saunpane kii maang kii
 The BJP lashed out at the Congress and said that instead of the AICC, the matter was to be handed over to the police
 bijepi ke is trump card se sadan main shorgul kar rahe congressi kheme main achaanak shanti chaa gayi
 There has been a fierce tussle between the BJP and the Congress for two days in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly
 mukhyamantri raman singh ke tisare kaarykaal kii yah antim baithak he
 Two days have passed since this session lasting five days
 donon hi din congress ke naam rahe
 The Congress fiercely attacked the BJP inside and outside the House
 kabhi party ke ghoshnaa patr main kiye gaye vaayadon ko puraa na karne ko lekar uski gheraabandi kii
 So at times the problems of farmers, laborers and government employees were not resolved, as well as the government's hoaxes for covering the curtain in corruption cases
 congress ke tewaron se donon din bijepi sadan main apane liye surakshit thikaane khojate rahi
 Meanwhile, he raised the issue of sexual abuse allegations against NSUI national president Feroze Khan in the House
 bijepi ne maang kii he ki chhattisgarh ke bhilai kii jis peedit mahila netaa ne apni aapbeetee AICC ko bataur shikaayat saunpi he, use ab police ko bheja janaa chahie
 So that the real face of Congressmen can be exposed
 is maamle ke uchhalte hi congressi sakate main aa gaye
 BJP MLA Devji Bhai Patel accused the Congress of trying to crack the case of sexual abuse
 iske chalate chhattisgarh kii shoshit beti ko nyaay nahin mil paa rahaa he
 Devji Bhai Patel drew the attention of the House demanding a high-level inquiry into the matter
 udhar party kaa bachaav karte hue netaa pratipaksh tii
 s
 singh dev ne kaha ki AICC behad gambhirtha ke saath maamle kii jaanch kar rahi he or doshiyon ke khilaaf kaarywahi bhi hogi
 After exiting the House, he said till date that the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly did not give any arrangement to his opponents in this matter
 darasalchhattisgarhse NSUI kii pradesh pratinidhi ne apane rashtri adhyaksh par uske yon shoshan kaa aarope lagaaya tha
 The victim's lady leader had also submitted some evidence to the AICC along with these allegations
 peedit ladki ne yah bhi kaha tha ki yadi party forum se use nyaay nahin mila to wo police kii sharan main jaaegi
 Following this complaint, AICC also constituted a three-member committee to investigate the matter
 shikaayat hue maheenaa bhar guzar chukaa he lekin abhi tak is maamle kii jaanch puri nahin ho pai he
 Therefore, by accusing Late Latifi of investigation, BJP surrounded Congress within the House
 chhattisgarh vidhaan sabha kaa satr khatm hone main ab maatr do din hi shesh bache hai
 In these two days, the Congress has urged the BJP to calculate the entire fifteen years

 So, in this Vidhan Sabha session, the Congress is working on a new strategy daily to intensify the attack on BJP
 lekin bijepi ke yon shoshan ke mudde ke oochaal dene se congress ke armaanon par pani phirata najar aa rahaa he
 Congress submitted the complaint letter to the Speaker of the Assembly
 After the completion of the first day of Chhattisgarh Assembly, the Congress submitted a complaint letter to the Legislative Assembly Secretariat late in the evening

 K
 raay or vidhayak siyaaraam kowshik kii vidhaan sabha sadsyta khatm kii jaae
 Congress also cited defection law for this
 bataa den, in teenon vidhayakon ne kareeb do saal pehle congress kaa saath chhod chhattisgarh janata congress kaa daaman tham liya he
 After Ajit Jogi enters the camp, all three mlas do not hold back from attacking the Congress
 ve aksar apane bayanon se congress ke tamaam netaaon kii pole kholane kaa kaam karte hai
 For this reason, the Congress has submitted a letter to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly to abolish his legislature
 lekin congress kaa ye kadam kargar najar nahin aa rahaa he, kyonki vidhaan sabha kii karrwai anischitkaal ke liye khatm hone main mahaj do din hi baanki he
 So it is believed that all the three sitting mlas suspended from the Congress will complete their term

 dilli main dengue teji se pair pasaar rahaa he
 The situation is that so far 11 people have died from it, while now the MCD itself is questioning the fogging used for the prevention of dengue
 dengue se nipatane main naakaam emsididengue se nipatane main emsidi abhi tak naakaam sabit ho rahi hai
 More than 1800 cases and 11 deaths are enough to tell that the situation has worsened but the MCD which is responsible for prevention of dengue is now neutralizing the fogging that is being done to deal with it in Delhi amid the rising outbreak of dengue
 Is telling emsidi kii maane to dengue ghar ke andar rahane vaale edies izpti machhar se failata he, isliye foging kaa us par koi prabhaav nahin hota
 Fogging is turning out to be a disadvantage
 Chairman of the Standing Committee of South MCD, Radhey Shyam Sharma said, "fogging is happening to prevent dengue but it is not effecting because fogging outside the homes is causing indoors
" The same fogging, not dying mosquitoes, has increased the problem for asthma patients
 ' chaunkaane vaali baat to yah he ki aaj foging ko beasar or swasthya ke liye khatra bataane vaali emsidi abtak lagbhag 7 karod rupye foging par phoonk chuki he
 Seven crores have been burnt on fogging
 MCD Delhi has a budget of about 5 crores for rainfed diseases including dengue, including the three mcds, but the MCD has so far burnt around 7 crores only on fogging
 or us par turra ye ki ab vahi emsidi foging par sawaal khadey kar rahi he
 Where was the opposition going to remain silent on this attitude of MCD, he demanded the resignation of both the Mayor and CM Kejriwal on this issue
 congress maange kejariwal or meyar donon kaa istiphanorth emsidi ke netaa vipaksh mukesh goyal kehete hai, 'bahut pehle hi aagaah kar diya gaya tha ki dengue failega lekin inhone kuch nahin kiya
 i believe that both Kejriwal and the Mayor are responsible for this, both resign
 saaf he ki dengue teji se dilli ko apni chapet main le rahaa he lekin use roak paane main naakaam emsidi ab khud ke prayaason ko hi dhata bataa kar naakaami chhipaane kii koshish main laga he
 Even though in the 2015 assembly elections, the BJP is looking forward to go ahead with the work and policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi without advancing any local face, but if seen, the biggest stature in Bihar BJP would also be another Modi's
 is
 bhaajapa ke ye duusare modi hai susheel modi
 Of course Sushil Modi holds the greatest stature in Bihar BJP today
 ve endie sarkaar main upmukhyamantri or vitt mantri jaisi ahm bhoomika nibhaa chuke hai or kabhi bihar main bijepi kaa cheharaa maane jate the
 Let's take a look at the political life of Sushil Modi: 1

 He also reached the assembly in 1995 and 2000
 7
 He was the Leader of Opposition in the Bihar Legislative Assembly from 1996 to 2004
 8
 In the Patna High Court, he filed a public interest litigation against Lalu Prasad, which was exposed as a fodder scam
 9
 In 2004, Sushil Modi contested the Lok Sabha elections and won from Bhagalpur
 10
 The NDA got a majority in the 2005 Bihar elections
 nitish kumaar mukhyamantri bane to susheel modi ko upmukhyamantri kii jimmedaari mili
 Together took charge of the Finance Ministry and several other departments
 11
 The NDA again won in 2010 and Sushil Modi again became the Deputy Chief Minister in the Nitish government
 12
 In July 2011 as Finance Minister, Sushil Modi was made the Chairman of the Committee of State Finance Ministers on the GST
 is baar ke chunaavon main bijepi bihar main kisi ko mukhyamantri ummidavaar ke rup main pesh nahin karne ja rahi or pradhanmantri narendra modi ke kaam kii badaulat chunaav ladane kii taiyaari main he

 biio ke anusaar aaj teachers se zyada veshyaayein apane kaam ko puri lagan or kartavyanishtha se karti hai

 He said this at c (municipal Resource Center) Premnagar annual educational function jashan-e-talim-2014
 is samaaroh kaa theme talim-tarbiyat-tahjeeb rakhi gai thi
 The chief guest at the event was Rajendra Prasad Yadav, District Basic Education Officer, Kanpur
 is dauraan kareeb 20 primary mahila teachers ko basic shiksha adhikari ne unke sevanivrutt hone par unhen sammanit bhi kiya
 BEO compares Yun's prostitutes and teachers: As soon as Mike was on the stage, the basic education officer of Kanpur district Rajendra Prasad Yadav, sitting in the hall, turned towards the teachers of the primary school and said, 'mann ki loser haar, man ko jeet jeet '
 uske baad biio ne jo kaha, usase haul main khamoshi chaa gai
 In fact, the BEO expressed concern over the declining level of education in primary schools not only in the district but also that a prostitute also understands her work that prostitution is written in our destiny, so she does it honestly 
 magar hamaare teacheron ko jo duty di gai he, use puraa karnaa to dur unhen chote bacchon ko padhaane main shame aati he, tamaam teacher isko apni tauheen samajhate hai, apana apmaan samajhate hai or padhaane se kataraate hai
 Which is the biggest shortcoming of today's time
 suvidhaon ke baavjood gir rahaa shiksha kaa str:rajendra yadav ke anusaar agar aaj ke teachers apni kami kaa aankalan khud karen to unhen apane dosha dikh jaaenge
 According to him, in spite of all the facilities in basic education, its level is declining day by day
 magar ye dosha keval teacher kii taraf se hi nahin, abhibhavakon kii taraf se bhi he
 Recalling the education of his era, he said that he too has reached here today with education from primary school
 us samay jo parivesh or anushaasan primary skulon main hua karata tha, aaj vah bilkul badal chukaa he
 The intention of the government is to give fear-free education, but in practice when we go on giving fear-free education, we have to face some difficulty somewhere
 unhone apane dinon ko yaad karte hue kaha, ham log jab padhate the tab guru or shishy kaa atoot sambandh hota tha, pehle bhi sajaa ham logon ko di jaati thi
 But there was no complaint from anyone's guardian and it was not at that time as much punishment is needed for today's environment
 aaj kii tulana main ham log kaaphi anushaasit the
 Gurus respected and worked with time, yet there was a beating if there was any shortage
 hamen ye bhay tha ki ghar se ham logon kii taraf se bachaav main koi nahin he, balki agar ghar main guruji khabar kar denge to ghar main bhi pitayee hogi
 This fear is needed today
 lekin shashan kii manshaa he ki agar aap unako bhaybheet karenge to wo pard bhi nahin sakate
 Whereas in practice you feel that such things are needed
 shiksha main giravat aane kaa ye bhi ek mukhya kaaran he
 'defeat the mind, win the hearts of the hearts': According to the BYO, whatever form the child may come, he does not come to the teacher's shelter as a scholar
 usko lekar jab aap chaah lenge, uske prati aap ruchi le lenge, jab aapke andar apane kartavya kaa bodh aa jayega to nishchit hi us bachche ko behatar banaaya ja saktaa he
 But when you believe that they are such failed children that they cannot learn anything, then the losers of the mind are the losers, the victories won by the mind
 jab aap ye man bana lete he ki ye baccha kuch sikh hi nahin saktaa to nishchit hi aapaki manovruti badal jaati he or wo baccha kuch sikh nahin paata
 Teachers have no concept clear about their subjects: According to them, the biggest thing is that most teachers today do not have a clear concept of their subject
 isliye jo aapako padhaanaa he use aap pehle samajhen or usamen aapaki puri lagan honi chahie
 The teacher who will not clear the concept of his subject, cannot give good education to his children
 kisi cheez ko khud siikhnaa ek kala he, magar usee cheez ko duusare ko siikhnaa duusari kala he
 Therefore, when your concept of your subject is clear, then you will be able to understand that where you are teaching your children, how hard is it
 ek teacher samaaj or desh ke liye sabase bada guide he, jiske kandhe par desh kaa bhaar he
 The child will be the same light in the country as you make
 sarkari skool ke adhyaaapak padhaanaa nahin chaahate:logon ko sarkari skulon main hi padhaane kii sabase badi chahat hoti he
 But no one wants to teach the children there
 aaj sabase zyada taadaat or sabase zyada aavedan patr shiksha vibhaag main hi aate hai
 Lakhs of applications are received for a post, so we are assuming that no one wants to go to teach in government schools
 aaj baari sankhya main aise bhi teachers hai jinhen apni class ke naa to bacchon kaa naam pataa he or naa hi un bacchon ke mata-pita kaa naam pataa hota he
 Whereas in our days, the Guru knew the name of the parents along with the children
 ham apane shikshak saathiyon se keval ek nivedan karenge ki aap acchhee se acchhee shiksha apane bacchon ko dijie
 You have knowledge, you have the power that can work to bring these children into a good citizen

 Govinda and his comedian nephew Krishna Abhishek's dispute seems resolved
 krishna ek baar phir maafee maang sakate hai
 In fact, Krishna has mistaken his wife Kashmirira Shah for a comment
 spotbvoy ko die intervyuu main krishna ne kaha, 'us din kashmira ne soshal media par jo bhi likhaa, vah ho saktaa he maami ko bura laga ho
 However, she wrote not for Mami, but for my sister
 kashmira se 2 galati huin, ek to jis samay usne post kiya, vah samay galat tha
 The second is that he should not write the same about anyone
 ' krishna ne aage kaha, meri patni kashmira se galati hui he or use maami se maafee maangani chahie
 "at one time, Govinda had done 40 films, signifying that Kashmiri wrote in a social post, 'people are dancing for money
 ' darasal, bataaya jaataa he ki govinda paise lekar krishna ke kamedi sho main aae the
 Perhaps this is the thing that Kashmirira targeted Govinda
 govinda or krishna kaa vivaad lambey samay se chal rahaa he
 Recently Krishna celebrated the birthday of her twins, but Govinda and his wife Sunita were missing from the party 
 sunita ne ek baatcheet main kaha, hamane unase duuri bana lee he or ye kabhi nahin badalane vaala
 On the question of Krishna's sons' absence from the birthday party, Sunita said, "we were in London on that date (3 June)
 lekin party main shaamil na hone kaa ye ek maatr kaaran nahin he, darasal hamen bulaayaa hi nahin gaya tha
 "govinda's conversation with nephew Krishna stopped, wife said - now everything is over vidhansabha satr ke tisare din vidhsansabha main khub hangaamaa hua
 Leader of the Opposition Vijendra Gupta raised the issue of presenting the CAG report to the House on the Delhi government advertisements under a Point of Order, which was not accepted by the speaker
 is par vijendra gupta ne sadan main narebaaji shuru kar di
 There was also a lot of debate between Gupta and the speaker about the rules on this issue
 isi dauranvijendra guptane vidhansabha ko bhang karne kii maang kar kaha ki sadan main samvidhan kaa paalan nahin ho rahaa
 On this, Delhi government minister Satyendra Jain got angry
 unhone kaha ki vijendra gupta vidhansabha bhang karne kii dhamkee de rahe he kyonki centre main unki sarkaar he
 Later, other mlas also came out in protest against Gupta's statement
 alka lamba ne to maamle ko visheshadhikaar samiti ko bhejne kii maang kii
 However, the speaker did not pass any judgment on this demand
 spikar ne kaha ki wo is par vichaar karenge
 Asked if it could have been managed better, he said - if your enforcement department, IT, is weak then it cannot be managed
 yah prashasnic mudda he
 Do you think that income tax officials do not know who has black money? The next six months will be very disorganized, however, it will depend on how soon you bring new currency
 yadi nakadi kii koi samasya hi nahin he to vidadroll par seemaa kyon lagaai gai he
 When asked that you said that this issue had also come up during the UPA government's rule but you 'refused' it, he said that yes, we felt that it should not be done and just we did not implement it
 kehete hai mauka dekhakar chaukaa lagaana kamaal kaa hunar hota he
 It can achieve many highs in life from getting a party ticket
 nikamme hote hue bhi yah aapako bahuton kii ankhon kaa tara bana detaa he
 There is nothing to do, just when the opportunity arises, the motivation of some of your qualities is to tell the man of your immediate work
 ab isse bollywood bhi kaise achoota rah saktaa he
 If the hero-heroines want work, someone will have to kill them
 agar kaam mil gaya he or ek-do filmein hit ho gai he to tikne ke liye filmi duniya ke diggajon kii tarifon ke kaside bhi yada-kada padhane hi padhenge
 Now Jacqueline did the same thing
 unki pichhali kuch filmein acchhee gayi
 Salman Khan's kick changed the fate
 bas unki salmaan se dosti bhi jam gai
 It is well known that when Salman Khan is in hand, acting becomes secondary, language does not matter and there is not much need for expressions and becomes a beautiful Katrina Kaif
 isi se prerit hokar srilankai hasina ne khulaasa kiya he ki unki hindi salmaan khan ne sudhari he
 Sallu Bhai inspired him to speak Hindi on every occasion
 vaaki salmaan nae logon kaa bahut hausala badhaate hai
 If these foreign girls are there then even more
 vaise yah bhi bataa dete hai ki jaclin ne hindi or urdu ke liye kuch din pehle tak ek teacher rakh rakhaa tha
 Whose name is Kamal Ahmed
 ek story ke silsile main unase baat hui thi
 While i was talking to him on the subject of teaching Hindi, Jacqueline was also there, and she also made Jacqueline talk to me
 mere adhiktar sawaalon kaa jawaab jaclin ne hindi main diya
 i congratulated Kamal Saheb
 or yah baat kik se thode pehle kii thi
 Kamal Saheb was teaching Hindi with heart and heart
 ab jaclin ko ek din to hindi bolni hi thi
 But to express and dedicate his art, he chose Salman Khan to do a six off the full-ball ball and proved that he too has the chance to hit the foursome
 asli prerana salmaan khan bane, or jaclin ek film main hi unase farrotedaar hindi sikh gayi
 This is really awesome is tarah har insaan ko ek salmaan chahie hota he
 
 
 Hence, be careful

 Maneria initially looked uncomfortable with Ashwin's ball
 shah ne acha pradarshan karte hue haalanki team ko is score tak pahunchane main madad kii lekin vah team ko chunauteepurn score tak nahin pahunchaa sake
 Ashwin dismissed in-form Ajinkya Rahane (15) off the third ball of his spell
 rahane acha khel rahe the, unhone nuan kulashekhara kii gend par street cover drive se khaataa khol tha
 But he was dismissed by giving an easy catch to Kulasekara in an attempt to lift the ball at mid-off
 rahane ke out hone ke baad shah krij par utre, jinhone khaataa kholane ke liye saat gend kaa istemaal kiya or phir shadaab jakaati ke over main mid aan par pari kaa doosraa chakka jadaa
 Captain Rahul Dravid was playing well at the other end, but Jakati ended his 26-run innings with three fours and a six
 tippaniyan By the end of the eighth over, the score was reduced to 50 for two and it was now Shah's responsibility to take the team to a respectable score
 shah ne ashok maneria ke saath tisare wicket ke liye mahaj 65 gend main 92 ran kii bhagidaari nibhaai jisase rajasthan rails kii team yah score khadaa karne main safal rahi

 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main mili prachand bahumat ke liye dilli sthit bhaajapa mukhyalay main desh kii janata kaa aabhaar prakat kiya
 Along with PM Modi, party president Amit Shah and Home Minister Rajnath Singh were also present at the BJP headquarters in Delhi
 madhya pradesh ke purv mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan or jepi nadda samet kai bade netaaon ne piem modi ko maala pahanaakar swaagat kiya
 On the stage, PM Modi said that
 
 
 piem modi ne loksabhaa chunaav main mili prachand jeet ke liye janata kaa naman karte hue kaha ki desh kii janata ne is fakir kii jholii ko bhar diya
 He described this victory as the biggest event in the history of democracy
 unhone kaha, 'aaazaad hone ke baad desh main kai loksabhaa chunaav hue, lekin sabase zyada matdaan is chunaav main hua
 That too in the heat of 40-42 degrees
 yah apane aap main janata kii jaagarukta ko darshata he
 The whole world has to recognize it
 'unhone kaha, 'loktantr ke khatir jin-jin logon ne balidaan diya he or jo log ghayal hue hai unke prati main samvednaa prakat karata hum
 Dying for democracy in democracy, this mishal will continue to inspire generations to come
 main chunaav ayog ko, suraksha balon ko or loktantr ke is utsav ko sanbhaalane vaale sabhi logon ko badhai detaa hum
 'PM Modi said,' When the war of Mahabharata ended, Krishna was asked who you were in favor of
 main samajhataa hum ki us samay bhagwaan ne jawaab diya tha, aaj vahi jawaab janata ne krishna ke rup main jawaab diya he
 God said at that time that i was not in favor of anyone
 main to sirf hastinapur ke liye hastinapur ke paksh main khadaa tha
 Today 130 crore people are standing in favor of India for India
 desh ke saamaanya naagarik kii bhaavana bharat ke ujjwal bhavishya kii guarantee he
 'PM Modi said,' i was saying from the first day that this election is not fought by any party or leader but the people of the country
 jinke aankh kaan band the unke liye meri baat ko samajhnaa mushkil tha
 But today my sentiment has been revealed by Janata Janardhana
 isliye agar koi vijayi hua he to hindustan vijayi hua he, agar koi vijayi hua he to loktantr vijayi hua he
 That is why all of us NDA partners dedicate this victory at the feet of the public
 'piem ne aage kaha, 'is loksabhaa chunaav main jo vijayi hue hai
 i congratulate them a lot
 vijayi hone vaale sabhi pratinidhiyon ko kandhe se kandhaa milakar desh ke vikaas main kaam karenge iske liye main sabhi ko shubhakamanaayen detaa hum
 Congratulating the winning parties in four assembly elections, PM Modi said that i want to assure all the states that our party and government is dedicated to the Constitution
 sangheey vyavastha par samarpit he
 i want to assure that our government will go shoulder to shoulder for the development of these states
 saath hi unhone party kaaryakartaaon ke kathin parishram kii jamkar saraahna kii or unhen jeet kii badhai di
 Speaking on the party's visit, PM Modi said that the specialty of the BJP is that we have ever been two but we have never deviated from our path and have come back again
 jab do the tab bhi niraash nahin hue or dobaaraa aae to bhi na sanskaar chodenge, na ardash chodenge or na hi namrata chodenge
 He said that this is not the victory of Modi, it is the victory of the aspirations, aspirations, yearning for honesty in the country
 yah vijay us biimaar vyakti kii he jo paise na hone ke kaaran ilaaj nahin karvaa paa rahaa tha or aaj ilaaj karvaa paa rahaa he
 This is the victory of those farmers who are busy working on their stomachs, bypassing the thoughts of their stomachs
 yah pakke ghar main haal me pravesh karne waalon kii vijay he
 PM Modi said that this victory is the victory of those middle class people who have been paying taxes without thinking
 is chunaav ne eemaandaaree ko ek nai sweekruti di he
 The Jamaat, chanting secularism slogans, stopped speaking from 2014 to 2019
 ye benakaab ho gaye
 He said that no such elections were held in India when inflation has not become an issue, but in this election the opposition did not make it an issue even once
 saath hi yah pehla chunaav tha jab koi bhi dal sarkaar par bhrashtachar kaa aarope nahin laga paaya
 Therefore political pundits did not understand how to weigh it
 unhone kaha ki janata ne ek nayaa nerrative desh ke saamne rakh diya he
 That is, now only two castes will be left in this country and the country will remain focused on these two castes
 jati ke naam par khel khilne waalon par is chunaav main kadaa prahaar hua he
 There is a caste which is poor and another caste who want to free them from poverty
 yah do hi jatiyaan hai
 We have to empower both
 ye donon shaktiyaan is desh se garibi ke kalank ko mitaa sakati hai
 He said that this is the time when Mahatma Gandhi will celebrate 150 years and celebrate 75 years of independence
 1942 se 1947 tak har vyakti har kaam aazaadee ke liye karata tha
 From 1942 to 1947 a mass movement played an important role in independence
 yah kalkhand desh ke itihaas main behad mahatvapurn rahaa
 Today, if we also take a pledge that the country should be made a developed India, then we can take the country to new heights
 isliye is chunaav ko namrata se swikaarna he
 PM Modi said, 'what happened in the election, how it happened, who spoke, what said, those things have passed for me
 ab hamen aage badhanaa he
 Opponents also have to carry along
 loktantr kii maryaadaaon ke bich chalanaa he
 Walking while holding the spirit of the constitution
 main vishwaas dilaanaa chahta hum ki janata ne is fakir kii jholii to bhar di, aashaa or aakankshaon ke saath bhari he main jaanata hum
 i also understand this seriousness
 lekin main kahuunga ki janata ne 2014 main kam jaanate hue bharosa kiya or 2019 main zyada jaanane ke baad mujhapar bharosa kiya
 i understand the feeling behind it
 isliye main kahana chahta hum ki desh ne jo daayitv diya he uske liye meraa vaada he ki main badaniyat se koi kaam nahin karuunga
 'he said that while doing work there may be a mistake, but i will not do any work in a bad way
 main mere liye kuch nahin karuunga
 He further said that every moment of my time, every particle of my body is only for the countrymen
 janata jab bhi meraa moolyankan kare in teen taraazuon par mujhe kasate rahanaa
 If there is any shortage, then curse me
 lekin main vishwaas dilaanaa chahta hum ki main saarvajanik rup se jo baaten bataata hum usko jeene ke liye bharpoor prayaas karuunga
 The separatists in Jammu and Kashmir have created an atmosphere of fear regarding Article 35A
 pichley ek hafte se ghati main pradarshan ke naam par daraane vaale tevar dikhaae ja rahe hai
 Meanwhile, the separatists have also called for a two-day bandh
 is band kaa asar yah hua ki sarkaar ne somvaar yani aaj jammu se ravaanaa hone vaale amarnath yatra par brake laga diya he
 Actually, the petition filed on Monday regarding Article 35A is to be heard in the Supreme Court
 jiske khilaaf hurriyat netaaon ne band kaa aahvaan kiya he
 This application is pending for the last 4 years
 2014 main anuchhed 35 e ko lekar kanoonee jang supreme court tak pahunch gai thi
 But in the last four years, there has been only talk on this
 'tirangaa uthaane kaa anjaam bura hoga'sawaal ye he ki anuchhed 35 e ke naam par aisa kya he jisase hurriyat kii chikhen nikal rahi hai? hurriyat netaa bilal waar kehete hai ki 35 e ke kaaran kashmir ek he
 If it is removed it will rust
 haalanki, anuchhed 35 e ko lekar ghati main sabhi partiyaan apana raajnneetik hit sadhate najar aati hai
 Does the withdrawal of 35A mean closure of separatism shops, if not, why Hurriyat leaders are threatening Kashmir and threatening the country since the Supreme Court hearing? National Conference leader Javed Rana said that no one would raise the tricolor during the bandh
 aisa karne par anjaam bura hoga
 Article 35A was brought to Kashmir 64 years ago
 tab kashmir ko desh ke duusare rajyon se alag vishesh adhikaar die gaye the
 But in 64 years, there have been constant questions on why there is a separate law for Kashmir and whether such a law is the root of separatism? Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Muftian, who were united on 35A, have each other's political issues Opponents like the alliance of Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti's party
 dhamkiyaan dene or desh ko kashmir par dar dikhaane vaali baton ke saath donon partiyaan sadak par utar gayi
 Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that any matter is in the court, there is a debate in it and in the argument, the government will present its stand on Jammu and Kashmir
 sunwaayee se pehle hangaamaa karne kii jarurat nahin
 At the same time, Congress is saying that Sections 370 and 35A are no longer the same
 haalanki, is mudde par congress ke liye saaf saaf bolnaa mushkil he
 But this has been the political agenda of the BJP, yet the government could not keep a clear opinion on 35A in the court
 vahiin, bijepi ke netaa khulkar bolte rahe hai ki 35e nahin hona chahie
 It should be removed
 aakhir kya he anuchhed 35 e or kyon kaha jaataa he ki algaavvaad kii jaden isi main chuphi hai, aaie jaanate hai
 
 
 > Article 35A has given Jammu and Kashmir the right to consider whom as its permanent resident and who is not
 > jammu kashmir sarkaar un logon ko sthai nivasee maanati he jo 14 may 1954 ke pehle kashmir main based the
 > Such permanent residents have got special rights in buying land, getting employment and government schemes
 > desh ke kisi duusare rajya kaa nivasee jammu-kashmir main jaakar sthai nivasee ke taur par nahin bas saktaa
 > Residents of other states can neither buy land in Kashmir, nor can the state government give them a job
 > agar jammu-kashmir kii koi mahila bharat ke kisi anya rajya ke vyakti se shaadi kar le to uske adhikaar chin liye jate hai
 > Omar Abdullah is also married to a woman from outside the state, but his children have all the rights of the state
 > umr abdulla kii bahan sara abdulla rajya se baahar ke vyakti se vivaah karne ke baad sampatti ke adhikaar se vanchit kar di gai hai
 It was added only under Article 370 of the Constitution, because of Article 35A> Article 370, the citizens of Jammu and Kashmir have dual citizenship
 > anuchhed 370 kii vajah se jammu kashmir main alag jhanda or alag samvidhan chalata he
 > Due to this, the tenure of the Legislative Assembly in Kashmir is 6 years, while in other states it is 5 years
 > isaki vajah se jammu-kashmir ko lekar kanoon banane ke adhikaar bhartiya sansad ke paas bahut simit hai
 > Pass laws in Parliament do not apply in Jammu and Kashmir like right to education, nor right to information
 > naa to aarakshan miltaa he, naa hi nunatam vetan kaa kanoon lagu hota he
 What is the legal aspect of this?> In 2014, an NGO named We the Citizens filed an application in the Supreme Court
 > is arji main samvidhan ke anuchhed 35A or anuchhed 370 kii vaidhata ko chunauti di gai
 > It was argued that there was no mention of such special status in Kashmir while framing the Constitution
 > yahaan tak ki samvidhan kaa draft banane vaali samvidhan sabha main chaar sadsy khud kashmir se the
 > Article 370 was the temporary provision, which was brought at that time to strengthen the general and democracy
 > samvidhan nirmaataaon ye nahin sochaa tha ki anuchhed 370 ke naam par 35 e jaise praavdhaan jode jaaenge
 > Article 35A strikes at the sentiment that unites the whole country as one India
 > jammu kashmir main duusare rajyon ke nagarikon ke adhikaar naa hona samvidhan ke mul adhikaron ke khilaaf he
 What is the history of Article 35A?> Article 35A was added to the Constitution in the year 1954 by an order of the President
 > ye aadesh tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawahar laal nehru kii cabinet kii salaah par jari hua tha
 > Two years earlier in 1952, Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah had a Delhi agreement
 > jiske tahat bhartiya naagarikta jammu-kashmir ke rajya ke vishyon main lagu karne kii baat thi
 > But Article 35A was specifically brought to show the special status of Kashmir
 > virodh kii daleel ye he ki ye raashtrapati aadesh he, jise khatm hona chahie
 Because there was no discussion and debate in Parliament on this
 > sansad ko bataae bina 35 e ko aise aadesh ke jariye samvidhan main jod diya gaya
 This is the reason behind the removal of Article 35A
 Article 35: The NGO, which has filed an application against AK, says that it will appeal to the Supreme Court to set up a constitutional bench to hear the matter
 anuchhed 35 e ko hataane kii sabase badi daleel yahi he ki ise sansad ke jariye lagu nahin karavaaya gaya
 Rather it was forcibly imposed by presidential order
 duusari badi daleel he ki desh ke bantwaare ke vakt badi sankhya main pakistan se log bharat aae the
 Millions of people had settled in Jammu and Kashmir as well, but Article 35A stripped them of their right to be permanent residents
 aise lakhon logon main adhiktar hindu-sikh samudaay se hai
 When the Election Commission announces the presidential election, the opposition parties are eagerly searching for their candidate till the government leaves
 vipakshi ekta kaa netritv karte hue sonia gandhi 17 vipakshi partiyon ke netaaon ke saath lunch par isaki charchaa kar chuki hai, iske pehle tamaam bade vipakshi netaaon se sonia-rahul mulaakaat kii thi
 But no opposition candidate's name has been finalized so far
 abhi tak chaar naam saamne aae hai
 The first name among them was of Sharad Pawar, but Power has not said Sonia
 baad main aadhikarik taur par ensipi ne saaf kar diya ki, sonia ne pavaar ko apher kiya tha, lekin unhone inkaar kar diya
 In fact, all the opposition including Congress know that after the support of YSR Congress, the number game is in favor of the government
 sarkaar annadramuk or tiares ke sampark main bhi he
 So how would Pawar do yes to lose the election
 haalanki, pavaar us surat main taiyaar ho sakate hai, jab satta paksh bhi unke naam par sahamat ho, jisaki ummid kam se kam virodhiyon ko nahin hi he
 Recently, Power has definitely given new speculation by meeting Prime Minister Modi
 sutron ke mutabik, pavaar kii koshish ye bhi he ki, sarkaar se aisa ummidavaar aae jis par vipaksh ko bhi aitraaj naa ho jisase chunaav kii naubat naa aae
 In the opposition, the name of Gopalakrishna Gandhi has been at the forefront, besides the names of Sharad Yadav and Meera Kumar have also been discussed, but their background is political
 aise main sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne mahatma gandhi ke praputra gopalkrishna gandhi kaa naam sujhaayaa, jo philhal res main aage hai
 At the same time, the Congress has made it clear that for opposition unity, it is ready for a candidate outside the Congress
 darasal, mayawati, yechuri, pavaar, akhilesh, mamata, nitish, karunanidhi, lalu samet 17 dalon kaa ankaganit bhi sarkaar ko nahin pachhad saktaa
 Simultaneously, efforts are being made to bring BJD and TRS together
 vipakshi dalon ko ummid he ki AAP or ovaisi bijepi ke khilaaf hi vot karenge
 AIADMK is also not opening the cards
 lekin ye sab milakar bhi sarkaar ke ummidavaar ko nahin haraa sakate
 Yes, the opposition Shiv Sena is in the process of breaking up allies of the government like it
 kul milakar ye sari kavayad raashtrapati chunaav jeetne se zyaada 2019 ke pehle mahagathbandhan banane kii disha main ek bada qadam he
 However, President Pranab Mukherjee was also the choice of the opposition parties, but he also made it clear that, he will not contest the election i
e
 he can become president again only on the consent of the government and the opposition, while the government sources have made it clear that he Candidates will give and will not make Pranav candidate again
 sarkaar kaa secular ummidavaar hoga sweekaar!aise main siyaasi taqaaze ke tahat vipaksh pehle sarkaar ke ummidavaar kaa naam saamne aane dena chahta he
 Only after that he will decide whether an agreement can be reached with the government on that candidate
 vaise vipakshi maanate hai ki, sarkaar kaa ummidavaar secular ho or sabko sweekaarya ho
 Many leaders say that we would like this to happen
 lekin hamako modi sarkaar se ummid kam he, isiilie ham saath-saath apane ummidavaar kii talash bhi kar rahe hai
 Group to be formed for coordination Meanwhile Sonia Gandhi has decided to form a small group of leaders from all parties to coordinate opposition parties, she will be formed soon
 is masale par congress pravaktaa abhishek manu singhvi ne kaha, 'sabhi vipakshi dalon se baat karke ye faisla hua he ki raashtrapati or uparashtrapati chunaav ke liye sonia gandhi sabhi dalon se kuch netaaon kii ek cameti bana den, jo sabake bich samanvay or raay banane kaa kaam karegi
 According to sources, Sharad Pawar will be offered the post of the head of this committee, along with Sitaram Yechury
 mamata or nitish se baat kii ja rahi he ki, wo yaa to khud cameti kaa hissaa ban jaaen yaa apane pratinidhi ko bana den
 'overall, the race for Raisina Hills is still going on
 uttar pashchimi dilli ke ashok vihaar ilaake main ek mahila ke upar goli chalaane ke maamle main police ne paanch logon ko giraftaar kiya he
 The woman was shot when she was returning home in a car with her nephew
 is ghatana main mahila ghayal ho gai he
 Police has informed about this on Monday
 police kaa kahana he ki vyavsaay main compatishan ke chalate mahila ko nishaanaa banaaya gaya
 The police have arrested all the five accused involved in the incident
 police ne bataaya ki mahila par goliyaan chalaane vaale teen aropiyon kii pahchaan saurabh rana (19), prince khaasaa (19) or danish bali (19) ke rup main hui he, jabaki sajeesh rachane main madad karne vaale do anya aropiyon kii pahchaan raaj kumaar verma (46) or ravi goyal (28) ke rup main kii gai he

 ab jab grosri shopping jaruri he, to aavashyak he un baton ko bhi jaananaa jinaki madad se aap kam paison or kam samay main behatar shopping kar sakate hai
 Know these 10 essential tips for better grocery shopping 1) Make a plan, even if it sounds strange to you, never disguise what you have to buy while going shopping
 behatar he ki jab bhi aapako jo saamaan yaad aae, use ek list main apadet karte jaaen
 2) Always take the shopping list with you
 On reaching the shop, we often find that we have forgotten the list at home, so always remember to keep the list together before going to the shopping
 yah list tab or bhi jaruri ho jaati he jab aapke paas simit samay ho or usee dauraan aapako ghar ke liye puraa saamaan apadet karnaa ho
 3) Create a group according to the shops of the goods, always divide the goods into a group, so that you will know what to go to which shop and how many different shops you need to visit in total
 is behatar planning se aap samay bachaa sakate hai
 4) Do not wander from the list, you have created the list for some particular reason, so it is important that you stick to it
 apni list ke prati eemaandaar rahenge to phijul ke kharch se bachenge
 5) In bulk, only the goods we need, often we buy something in greater quantity due to attractive offers like offers, discounts
 aapako hameshaa variety kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie jisase aap jaldi ubenge bhi nahin or thok kaa saamaan barbaad bhi nahin hoga
 6) Make a menu for a week's shopping: It is better to go to the shop to buy something or make a list of goods for a week and buy goods accordingly
 saath hi, agali shopping kii taarikh bhi tay kar len
 With this, you will not have to face the situation of sudden end of goods at home
 7) peak aavars main shopping na karenhameshaa shopping aise samay par hi karne jaaen jab bheed kam ho or pement ke liye line choti ho
 Also, you have free time
 hamen koshish kerani chahie ki shaam,raat or ravivaar kii dopaher main shopping par na jaaen
 At this time, most people gather for shopping and due to lack of time, they often miss something
 8) expyri date check karanjab bhi koi product kharid rahe hon to expyri date check karen
 Also check that there is no defect in the packing
 kai baar kuch chijen jo chhot yaa kam rate par bechi jaati hai ve apni expyri date ke najadik ho sakati hai yaa unki packing main koi kharabi ho sakati he
 This simply means that the quality of that item is compromised
 9)kisi friend ke saath shopping par jaaenjahan tak mumkin ho apni kisi aisi saheli yaa padosan ke saath khariddaari karne jaaen jo swasthya ke prati jaagruk ho or healdi food main vishwaas rakhti ho
 Junk food options easily tempt you during shopping
 khaskar jab junk food ke saath 'by van get van free' jaise ofer milte hai
 At such times, these friends prevent you from making such purchases
 10) labals ko samajhenkai products ke pack par lo fat jaise shabd likhe hote hai
 Most do not understand them properly
 adhiktar lo fat foods main sugar yaa namak bharpoor maatra main hota he jo usamen swaad ke liye daalaa jaataa he
 While buying food items, read the nutritional labels for the calories in it
 koi cheez kam calories vaali haito iskaa matlab yah nahin ki vah healdi bhi he
 You should eat not for calorie value, but for quality value

 However, after this its price has reduced to half
 lekin jahaan bitakwine ko badnaam karency mana ja rahaa he, vahiin isaki mul technology 'blockchen' ko bhavishya kii arthvyavastha ke liye krantikari mana ja rahaa he
 The popularity of blockchain has started increasing in the last year itself, but it is believed that it can revolutionize the future of India, from banking to Aadhaar and election system
 kya he blockchenblocchen asal main aise vikendrit digital lager hote hai jo sabhi tarah ke krypto karency ke aadhaar hote hai
 Blockchain technology has created the basis of a new type of Internet with the facility of distributing digital information rather than copying it
 vaise to iskaa ijad digital karency bitakwine ke liye kiya gaya tha, lekin ab iske duusare tarah ke istemaal par focus kiya jane laga he
 Acting as a distributed public ledger, the blockchain provides a decentralized and transparent method of transaction and also has a high level of security
 jaankaron kaa kahana he ki yah sirf digital karency hi nahin balki usase kahin aage kii cheez he
 It can further expand into a world interconnected with the Internet
 kya hai phydeinternet or blockchen kii jodi kaa phayda yah hoga ki isse data kii hanking kaa jokhim kam ho jayega, kyonki iske tahat lakhon computers ke ek chen ke dwaara data store kiye ja sakenge
 a major feature of blockchain is that it is decentralized in nature
 bainkon, helthecare, sarkari agenciyon main record rakhane ke liye abhi jis technology kaa istemaal hota he, uske vipareet blockchen main legers main badlaav ke liye kisi intermidiari kii jarurat nahin hoti he
 Each user in a blockchain is the custodian of his personal block and whenever a block is changed, the laser changes automatically
 lekin yadi koi doosraa farji vyakti isamen badlaav karnaa chaahe or kisi block ke bare main uske dwaara daali gai soochna match nahin karti to lager apadet nahin hoga
 Because of this, this technology is quite safe
 blockchen abhi shuruaati daur main he, lekin ise mukhyadhara main laane kaa prayaas shuru ho gaya he
 In addition to crypto currencies, the use of blockchain technology has started to be tested in many industries
 isamen sabase aage banking sector he
 In the next years more and more banks will use blockchain to avoid fraud and improve their business
 videsh main kai bank mani transfar ke liye blockchen aadhaarit kryptokarency kaa pareekshan kar rahe hai
 Moneygram, a US money transfer giant, has tied up with Ripple in this regard
 aisa mana ja rahaa he ki blockchen aadhaarit ripal jaisi technology se cross border mani transfar kaa time sirf 2 se 3 second rah jayega
 Apart from banking, many other sectors have also started testing blockchain technology to save cost and time
 bharat main kya hoga badlaaipane vikendrit prakruti kii vajah se blockchen technology hamaare dainik jivan main kai chizon par asar daal sakati he
 This technology is fast, safe and economical
 isliye digitigeshan main yah bharat jaise deshon main sarkari vibhaagon ke liye kaaphi upyukt sabit ho saktaa he
 Blockchain technology can be of great help in digitally based facilities like Aadhaar
 aadhaar main data li hone ko lekar kaaphi ho-hallaa hota rahaa he, lekin blockchen ke istemaal se yah samasya dur ho sakati he
 Aadhaar's data is decentralized, but blockchain technology will reduce its chances of falling into the wrong hands
 is bare main prayaas bhi shuru ho gaye hai
 According to a news from Business Line newspaper, the Government of Karnataka has decided to use blockchain technology and is also going to bring a white paper on its use in governance
 chunaav kharch main aegi kamiblocchen technology bharat menvotingki duniya main bhi krantikari badlaav laa sakati he
 According to an estimate, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Rs 3,424 crore was spent, but if blockchain technology is used in future elections, then the election expenses will be reduced and it will also become very safe
 is technology ke istemaal se votaron ke maamle main jaalsaji nahin ho paaegi
 Not only this, such a system can also be made in which voters can vote from their mobiles from their home

 Suspense remains on Congress President Rahul Gandhi's Kailash Mansarovar Yatra

 darasal, rahul gandhi ne 29 april ko dilli main party kaaryakartaaon ke ek kaarykram main elaan kiya tha ki wo kailash maansarovar yatra jaaenge
 For this, he also sought a 15-day leave from party workers

 It is being said from the Congress that after this Rahul sought special permission from the Ministry of External Affairs to go on the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra
 lekin congress sutron kaa daawa he ki rahul ko abhi tak vishesh anumati nahin di gai
 However, the information received by Aaj Tak is contrary to this

 It has also been told that there is no reason for Rahul Gandhi not to give 'political clearance' for the yatra
 yatra par jane ke do tareekekailash maansarovar yatra par jane ke do tareeke hai

interested people have to register for the journey tay taarikh ke andar icchhuk logon ko yatra ke liye registration karana hota he
 According to the Foreign Ministry press release released on 21 February this year, the last date for registration of the yatra was kept 23 March
 jabaki rahul gandhi ne yatra kaa elaan hi 29 april ko kiya tha
 Apart from this, there is an option to go on Mansarovar tour as a private tour
 isamen nepal root se hokar china se guzarate hue janaa padataa he
 It also requires a visa from China
 haalanki, agar koi sansad sadsy privet taur par yatra janaa chahta he to uske liye sarkaar se anumati leni padati he
 The Ministry of External Affairs allows this
 shanivaar ko congress party sutron ne bataaya tha kiraahul gandhi yatra ke nirdharitkaal main registration ke liye aavedan nahin kar paae the, jiske baad unhone yatra par jane ke liye vishesh anumati maangi thi
 The Congress says that the permission has not yet been received, while the Ministry of External Affairs is refusing to get the official application for permission

 The Shiv Sena has got another excuse to curse the BJP on the pretext of releasing the terrorist Masrat Alam
 party ke pramukh uddhav thakare se jab mumbai main poocha gaya ki, kya bijepi ne naitikta chhod di he? to ve tanj kasate hue bole, us baat par to aaj puraa desh bolaa rahaa he
 Say nothing more to me
 uddhav ne is se pehle jammu or kashmir ke mukhyamantri mufti mohammad said ke us faisle par sawaal uthaae jis ke tahat aatanki masarrat alam kii rihaai kii gai
 Uddhav also demanded a case to be registered against the Mufti for helping terrorism
 mumbai main samvaadadaataaon se baat karte hue uddhav ne poocha, 'kya kisi siem ke paas is tarah se kisi aatanki kii rihaai ke adhikaar hote hai? hamaare sainik jaan par khel aise aatankiyon ko pakadte hai or unhen reeha kiya jaataa he
 This is an insult to the army teams
 ' Earlier, Shiv Sena mps announced raising the issue of the release of Masrat Alam in the House in line with the party line in Delhi
 party ke saansad arvind saavant ne sansad bhawan main samvaadadaataaon se baat kii
 Sawant asked why the BJP has a double mind on terrorism? shivasena 18 saansadon ke saath NDA kaa doosraa sabase bada dal he

 Sanjay Kapoor, Chief Executive Officer (india and South Asia) of Bharti Airtel said that it is difficult for the industry to sustain the current rates in the telecom sector, given the stiff competition

 Taking a veil with suspense in the name of the next Chief Minister of Gujarat, the Bharatiya Janata Party has stamped the current Chief Minister Vijay Rupani
 nae mukhyamantri kii talash kii jimmedaari paae kendriya vitt mantri arun jetali ne roopaani ke naam kaa elaan karte hue kaha ki unke saath is baar gujarat main upmukhyamantri kii bhoomika main nitin patel honge
 Sources in the party believe that by giving responsibility to the post of Chief Minister once again, an attempt has been made to convey the message that the state government under Rupani has done a good job
 lihaaja, party ne rajya ko saaf sandesh diya he ki ek baar phir rupani or patel ke netritv main rajya ke vikaas ko tarjeeh di jaaegi
 However, experts believe that this time the state power is not so easy for the BJP government in the state and many new challenges are ready in the state to surround this pair of leadership
 gujarat main bijepi sarkaar ke saamne nai chunautiyangaanvon main bijepi ko lokapriy bananavijay roopaani or nitin patel ke saamne sabase ahm chunauti rajya ke gramin ilaakon main party kii sthiti ko majboot karne kii he
 The way the party has lost its grip in the rural areas to the Congress in the last elections, the central leadership can do it
 vahiin 2019 ke aam chunaavon ke maddenjar ek baar phir se mukhyamantri ban rahe roopaani or upmukhyamantri nitin patel ko gramin ilaakon ko vikaas ke gujarat model ke daayre main laana hoga
 The party has won the most seats in four big cities of Gujarat in this election
 patelon kii naaraazgi dur karnavidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon main party kaa mahaj 99 siton par simat jane kaa bada kaaran aarakshan ke mudde par patelon kii naaraazgi ko mana ja rahaa he
 Just as Hardia Patel and the Congress Party have campaigned to separate the Patel community from the BJP during campaigning, the party high command is heard alarm bells for 2019
 lihaaja, vijay roopaani ke saath nitin patel ko netritv ke sheersh par rakhkar party ne donon ko jimmedaari di he ki patel votbank main hue nuksaan kii bharpai kii jaae jisase 2019 main unhen patel samudaay kii naaraazgi kaa saamana na karnaa pade
 Also read: Gujarat was losing, Jaitley placed these bets and Modi won bjp's fort in 2019 Vidhan Sabha elections The increased seats in the account of Congress has made BJP feel lost in the fort
 jabaki 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main bijepi ne rajya kii sabhi siton par vijay hasil kar pradhanmantri bane narendra modi ko majboot karne kaa kaam kiya he
 But once again, the challenge of Congress's good performance in the assembly elections is to win all the Lok Sabha seats in the state to strengthen PM Modi in 2019
 2014 main party ne congress kaa supada saaf karte hue sabhi 26 siton par paracham laharaaya tha
 In such a situation, if a seat is reduced in 2019, the credibility of the party can be discounted
 pehle se taqatvar vipaksh se vidhansabha main nipatnagujarat main bijepi sarkaar ke beete chaar kaarykaal main teen ke dauraan narendra modi khud rajya kaa netritv kar rahe the
 During that time, the Congress continued to play a weak opposition in the state
 lekin vijay roopaani kii pichhali bijepi sarkaar ke baad party ko antiinkambency ke asar se satta ganvaane kaa gambhir khatra khadaa ho gaya tha
 But even after somehow being able to save the credibility of the party, the Congress party will be present as a strong opposition in the assembly in front of the new BJP government
 lihaaja, is sarkaar ne bijepi ko vidhansabha ke raste rajya ke liye nitiyaan nirdhaarit karne main congress ke mukhar virodh kaa saamana karnaa hoga
 This time BJP will get stronger opposition in the assembly than before
 ye bhi party ke liye badi chunauti he
 Leaving young leaders behind their experience is a relief for the BJP government from the opposition in the new assembly of Rajya Rajya, although it will have to resort to its experience to take advantage of it
 vidhansabha main congress ke paas adhikansh aise vidhayak hai jo pehali baar chunaav jitkar sadan main pahunche hai
 However, these new leaders were vocal among the public and also caused the bjp's loss in the election
 lekin vidhansabha main bijepi ke varisht or zyada tajurbekaar netaaon ko congress ke in yuva chehron ko sadhate hue peeche chhodane kaa kaam karnaa hoga
 If this new government of BJP fails to do this work, then in 2019 these faces can bring big trouble for them
 sadan main alpesh-jignesh jaise kai yuva pahunche hai
 In such a situation, the party will also have to face this youth power

 However, the father argued that his 12-year-old daughter lives in a hostel and he pays all his expenses
 court ne kaha ki achche pita kii tarah choti beti ko bhi kharch dete rahanaa chahie
 At present, the Chief Justice has issued orders to bring the girl to his chamber on Monday
