 dilli kaa pradooshan uskaa khud kaa he na ki duusare rajyon kaa
 Rajasthan's Environment Minister Rajkumar Rinwa has said that the data and satellite image in the meeting of the Union and Delhi Environment Ministers with four states in Delhi made it clear that it is not right to impose Delhi's pollution on other states
 meeting main rajasthan ke paryaavaran mantri ne kaha ki hamaare yahaan se koi fasal ke jalane or dhuaan aane kii ghatana nahin ho rahi he vahiin punjab or haryana ke mantriyon ne bhi is tarah ke galat aaropon par apni naaraazgi darj karai
 In the end, it was agreed that from next year, they would be used in different techniques to make the crops of the field eco-int and use it as firewood
 kisaanon ko fasal kaatane ke baad unke khet main hin us mitti ko fasal ke tukade samet bechney ke liye prerit kiya jayega jisase ki eco-phendli iten banengi
 With this, farmers will get money to sell soil and stems of the crop and new soil will also make the field fertile
 iske alaava inkaa jalaavan ke liye bhi prayog kiya jayega
 Planting oxygen-giving trees, however, when Delhi's pollution data and satellite images were kept in the meeting, it was clear that Delhi itself was responsible for its pollution instead of the surrounding areas
 gadiyon kii sankhya or gandagi ke alaava pipal or neem jaise oxygen banane vaale ped kahin nahin dikhte hai
 Therefore, it was decided that measures should be taken to reduce the number of vehicles in Delhi, as well as old vehicles should be removed and big trees like Peepal should be planted

 The Supreme Court of India expressed displeasure over the statement made by the Chief Minister of the state, Sarbananda Sonowal, in the case of making the National Register of Citizens in Assam, that when the Supreme Court itself is monitoring the case, it is appropriate to interfere with any other authority

 tippaniyan Significantly, the National Register of Citizens is being made under the supervision of the Supreme Court, the court said that while the monitoring of the case is pending in the Supreme Court itself, the interference of any other authority is not right

 In fact, the petitioner has stated in his petition that the unity and sovereignty of India has also been endangered because a large number of illegal immigrants are coming in from the neighboring country, which is affecting our major constitutional values

 On the nationwide agitation by the BJP over the CBI misuse, Lalu told reporters in Patna that many of his leaders deposited money in Swiss bank behind the bjp's prioritization of the alleged misuse of CBI, except inflation and many other major problems in the country
 Being connected is a matter of being trapped

 During the tenure of the previous NDA government at the Center, Lalu claimed that with the depositing of black money in Swiss bank, the money of big leaders of BJP was deposited there and said that Interpol should be imposed on them through CBI
 Can
 unhone daawa kiya ki ab jabaki swiss bank main unke netaaon dwaara jamaa kiye gaye paise ko nikaalane kii baat ho rahi he
 Therefore, they are already playing the role of misusing the CBI to say that if action is taken in future, they have been implicated in the case

 Lalu, suspecting that Gadkari had deposited the amount in the Swiss bank, alleged that he had what merit that the BJP made him the national president of the party
 unhone daawa kiya ki gadakari ke bare main yahi charchaa he ki uske paas athaah paisa he
 The RJD chief said that he wanted him and Mulayam Singh to be together in this matter

 Commenting on Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft Company, Bihar tour, Lalu said that Gates saw with his eyes what is the condition of the people during the tenure of Nitish Sarkar, who talked about the development of this state

 In the next Lok Sabha election, the cpm's leadership over the party's political line has been divided ‚Äî on the one hand it has to fight "the fascist BJP" and on the other hand it does not leave any chance for its traditional rival Congress
 party mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ko bengal ikai kaa samarthan he
 They believe that saffron forces can be stopped in 2019 by electoral alliances with the Congress
 isse bengal main bhi party kii kismat chamak sakati he jahaan mamata banerjee ne party ko farsh par laa pataka he
 Local leaders and cadres have been leaving the party continuously since 2011 when the party lost the election after 33 years in power
 kerala main congress or uske sahyogi hi sipiem ke mukhya pratidwandvi hai
 This is the reason why the party leadership, despite agreeing with Yechury and the Bengal unit of the party, is not ready to contest elections in 2019 with the Congress
 paulitte beuro ne yechuri kii line par vito kar diya or dilli main kendriya cameti kii haalia baithak main iske khilaaf zyada mat pade (bolne vaale 63 sadasyon main se 31-30, do ne bich kaa rasta chunaa)
 In January 2018, the Central Committee will meet again to finalize the political resolution for the party Congress
 paulitte beuro sadsy prakaash karaat or unke dhade ne yechuri ke is prastaav kaa virodh kiya tha
 Karat is maintaining the traditional Marxist line in which both Congress and BJP are considered political enemies
 unhen kerala ikai kaa samarthan he jisaki aguai mukhyamantri pinaraai vijayan karte hai (jinhen kai log aaj kii taarikh main paulitte beuro ke bheetar sabase taqatvar maanate hai)
 The Chief Minister's 27 loyalists are present in the 101-member Central Committee which also has five permanent invitees and five special invitees (VS Achuthanandan is on the last list and is naturally a Yechury supporter)
 kerala se aane vaale ek central cameti sadsy kehete hai, ''kerala or bengal ke rajnatik halaat alahada hai
 We cannot do electoral alliances with the Congress because we are fighting them politically
 "pinaraai is maamle main or talkh hai, ''congress ke saath koi rishta nahin banegaa
 Who is responsible for the rise of BJP? Congress is
 aaj kii congress kal kii bhaajapa he
 Therefore, betting on the Congress to fight the BJP is no solution

 The Ministry of Environment has issued a circular, according to which, while taking land for such works inside the forest, there is no need to seek the permission of the Central Government where trees are not cut or mining is not happening
 centre sarkaar ne ye aadesh beeti saat oktober ko jari kiya, jisamen rajya sarkaron ko ye adhikaar diya he ki vah kisi company, sanstha yaa form ko gairvaaniki kaam (jo asthai ho) ke liye zamin dene ke liye kisi naukarshah ko adhikrut kare

 Sudeep Srivastava, who was a petitioner in the Supreme Court in the coal scam, says, "the imposition of this order means that companies can enter the forest for exploration or survey of any mineral before mining without the permission of the central government
" survey ke vakt koi ped nahin kaata jaataa yani diefo str kaa adhikari isaki ijazat de saktaa he
 For this kind of activity, a proposal is sent to the Central Government under the law, but this law removes that obligation
 ' Central government officials argue that states are being empowered to reduce red tape, so that the officials of the DFO level of the state government should be allowed in the areas where the trees are not cut in the non-grinding areas

 But law experts are saying that if the Center wants to make such changes, then it should amend the Forest Protection Act of 1980 through Parliament

 com / arnxsfjzsz kendriya satarkta ayog yani sivisi ne dilli hycourt ko ek halafname main ye bataaya he ki desh ke sabase bade sarkari aspataal ames main maujuuda sivio kii niyukti uski (sivisi kii) purv sahmati (praayar apruval) ke bina hui
 Para 11 of affidavit given by CVC regarding investigation of corruption cases in AIIMS
 3 main kaha gaya he ki 14 agast 2014 ko mantralay ke joint secretary or sivio ko ames ke sivio kaa padbhaar shuru main teen maheene ke liye diya gaya jiske liye sivisi kii purv sahmati nahin lee gai
 It is worth noting that the same argument was made by the NDA government to remove former AIIMS CVO Sanjeev Chaturvedi that prior approval of the CVC was not taken for the appointment of Chaturvedi but now it is clear from the cvc's affidavit that the current CVO Manoj Jhalani was also appointed by the government without prior consent of the CVC
 haalanki baad main centre sarkaar ne jhalani ke naam par sivisi kii sahmati lee lekin usamen bhi niyamon kii anedkhi kii gai
 Manoj Jhalani, appointed to the post of CVO of AIIMS, is also the CVO of the Ministry of Health
 unhen ames ke sivio ke pad par niyukt karne ke liye sarkaar ne jo tarika apanaaya vah bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Para 2 of Vigilance Manual

 1 says that in order to appoint a CVO in any autonomous institution, a panel of three officers will be sent on behalf of the institute itself
 jis adhikari ke naam par sivisi sahmati degaa vahi sivio niyukt hoga, lekin manoj jhalani ke maamle main yah tarika nahin apanaaya gaya
 The ministry sent a panel of three officials of its own Ministry of Health in place of AIIMS officials
 ye teen adhikari he, shri manoj jhalani, shri rakesh kumaar or sushri dharitri pandas
 All three are in the Ministry of Health as Joint Secretary
 sawaal uthta he ki sarkaar ne kaise ames ke adhikariyon kii jagah swasthya mantralay ke adhikariyon kaa naam sivisi ke paas bheje jabaki sanjeev chaturvedi ke khilaaf shikaayat karne vaale je pi nadda sivisi minial ke isi niyam kii duhai dete rahe hai
 After the formation of the new Modi government at the Center last year, Sanjeev Chaturvedi was removed from the CVO post of AIIMS, causing much controversy
 tippaniyan NDTV India showed you the news that JP Nadda, then MP, not only wrote letters to Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to remove Sanjeev Chaturvedi, but also said that the investigation of corruption cases in AIIMS should be stopped which Chaturvedi exposed Huh
 nadda ne tab apni chitthiyon main centre sarkaar ko ames main apni pasand ke nae sivio kaa naam bhi sujhaayaa tha
 Now the cvc's affidavit also raises the question as to why JP Nadda replaced the AIIMS officer as the CVO of the Ministry which works under him
 ames main bhrashtachar ke maamalon kii jaanch ke bare main sivisi kii ore se diye gayi halafname ke para 11
 3 states that on 14 August 2014, the joint secretary and CVO of the ministry was initially given the charge of CVO of AIIMS for three months for which no prior consent of the CVC was taken
 gauratlab he ki ames ke purv sivio sanjeev chaturvedi ko hataane ke liye endie sarkaar kii ore se yahi daleel di gai thi ki chaturvedi kii niyukti ke liye sivisi kii purv sahmati nahin lee gai lekin ab sivisi ke halafname se saaf ho gaya he ki maujuuda sivio manoj jhalani ko bhi sarkaar ne sivisi kii purv sahmati ke bina niyukti kiya
 Although later the Central Government took the consent of the CVC in the name of Jhalani, but the rules were also observed in that
 ames ke sivio ke pad par niyukt kiye gayi manoj jhalani swasthya mantralay ke bhi sivio hai
 The method adopted by the government to appoint him to the post of CVO of AIIMS is also under question

 The CVO will be appointed by the officer in whose name the CVC consents, but this approach was not adopted in the case of Manoj Jhalani

 These three officers are Mr
 Manoj Jhalani, Mr
 Rakesh Kumar and Ms

 ye teenon swasthya mantralay main hi joint secretary ke pad par hai
 The question arises as to how the government sent the names of the Health Ministry officials to the CVC instead of the AIIMS officers, while JP Nadda, who complained against Sanjeev Chaturvedi, has been repeating the same rules in the CVC manual
 centre main pichley saal nai modi sarkaar banane ke baad sanjeev chaturvedi ko ames ke sivio pad se hataa diya gaya jisase kaaphi vivaad khadaa hua tha
 The comments enditivi india ne aapako khabar dikhaai thi ki us vakt bataur saansad je pi nadda ne na keval sanjeev chaturvedi ko hataane ke liye swasthya mantri harshavardhan ko chitthiyaan likhi balki ye bhi kaha ki ames main bhrashtachar ke un maamalon kii jaanch roki jaae jo chaturvedi ne ujagar kiye hai
 Nadda had then suggested to the Central Government the name of the new CVO of his choice in AIIMS
 ab sivisi ke halafname se yah sawaal bhi khadaa hota he ki je pi nadda ne ames ke adhikari kii jagah mantralay ke adhikari ko sivio kyon banaaya jo unke maatahat kaam karata he
 It is worth noting that the same argument was made by the NDA government to remove former AIIMS CVO Sanjeev Chaturvedi that prior approval of the CVC was not taken for the appointment of Chaturvedi but now it is clear from the cvc's affidavit that the current CVO Manoj Jhalani was also appointed by the government without prior consent of the CVC
 haalanki baad main centre sarkaar ne jhalani ke naam par sivisi kii sahmati lee lekin usamen bhi niyamon kii anedkhi kii gai
 Manoj Jhalani, appointed to the post of CVO of AIIMS, is also the CVO of the Ministry of Health
 unhen ames ke sivio ke pad par niyukt karne ke liye sarkaar ne jo tarika apanaaya vah bhi sawaalon ke ghere main he
 Para 2 of Vigilance Manual

 1 says that in order to appoint a CVO in any autonomous institution, a panel of three officers will be sent on behalf of the institute itself
 jis adhikari ke naam par sivisi sahmati degaa vahi sivio niyukt hoga, lekin manoj jhalani ke maamle main yah tarika nahin apanaaya gaya
 The ministry sent a panel of three officials of its own Ministry of Health in place of AIIMS officials
 ye teen adhikari he, shri manoj jhalani, shri rakesh kumaar or sushri dharitri pandas
 All three are in the Ministry of Health as Joint Secretary
 sawaal uthta he ki sarkaar ne kaise ames ke adhikariyon kii jagah swasthya mantralay ke adhikariyon kaa naam sivisi ke paas bheje jabaki sanjeev chaturvedi ke khilaaf shikaayat karne vaale je pi nadda sivisi minial ke isi niyam kii duhai dete rahe hai
 After the formation of the new Modi government at the Center last year, Sanjeev Chaturvedi was removed from the CVO post of AIIMS, causing much controversy
 tippaniyan NDTV India showed you the news that JP Nadda, then MP, not only wrote letters to Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to remove Sanjeev Chaturvedi, but also said that the investigation of corruption cases in AIIMS should be stopped which Chaturvedi exposed Huh
 nadda ne tab apni chitthiyon main centre sarkaar ko ames main apni pasand ke nae sivio kaa naam bhi sujhaayaa tha
 Now the cvc's affidavit also raises the question as to why JP Nadda replaced the AIIMS officer as the CVO of the Ministry which works under him
 ames ke sivio ke pad par niyukt kiye gayi manoj jhalani swasthya mantralay ke bhi sivio hai
 The method adopted by the government to appoint him to the post of CVO of AIIMS is also under question

 After the terror attack in Pulwama, the Indian Air Force (IAF) entered Pakistan on 26 February and carried out a surgical strike
 balakot(balakot Strike)sthit jaish-e-mohammad ke aatanki shiviron cobum barasaakar tabah kar diya tha
 However, the Indian Air Force could not make any video of this air strike
 yahi vajah he air strike ke pramaan ke taur par koi video vayusena jari nahin kar pai
 a political debate also erupted in the country regarding the death toll of terrorists from the air strike
 darasal hamale ke dauraan kuch aise halaat bane the ki bhartiya vayusena target par nishaanaa banane ke dauraan live video nahin hasil kar saki
 This was revealed during the review of the 26 February airstrikes on the terrorist camps of jaish-e-mohammad in Balakot
 bhartiya vayusena ne pushti kii he ki jab aatanki shiviron ko sateek lakshya banaakar bam giraae gaye, tab israeli air-tu sarphase mixise ko launch nahin kiya gaya tha
 Through this, the goal was to obtain a live video feed of the penetrating process
 sutron ne enditivi ko bataaya ki halke badalon kii maujuudagi ne karrwai ke vakt spice 2000 glide bamon ke saath crystal mej mixilon kii laanching roak di
 The Indian Air Force also hoped that after receiving a video feed of the attack through this missile, it would later put the proof of public tax action in front of the world, but this could not happen
 bataa den ki 26 farvari ko bhartiya vayusena ke miraj 2000 ladaaku vimaanon ne niyantran rekha ke paar jaakar pakistan main air strike kii thi
 a total of five Spice 200 glide bombs were dropped during this period

 Significantly, the Indian Air Force had to be uneasy after the claim of air strike when European Space Imaging released satellite images a day after the attack, claiming that there was no image in Balakot

 'sometimes, when you least expect it, life throws you a curveball
 i have recently been diagnosed with a high grade cancer that has metastised, which we frankly did not see coming
 a niggling pain led to some tests, which led to this unexpected diagnosis
 My family and close friends have rallied around me, providing the best support system that anyone can ask for
 i am very blessed and thankful for each of them
 There is no better way to tackle this, than to take swift and immediate action
 And so, as advised by my doctors, i am currently undergoing a course of treatment in New York
 We remain optimistic and i am determined to fight every step of the way
 What has helped has been the immense outpouring of love and support I've received over the past few days, for which i am very grateful
 I‚Äôm taking this battle head on, knowing i have the strength of my family and friends behind me

" In times of tragedy, of war, of necessity, people do amazing things
 The human capacity for survival and renewal is awesome
 ‚Äù The outpouring of love I‚Äôve received in the last few days has been so overwhelming


 and I‚Äôm especially grateful to those of you who shared stories of your experiences in dealing with cancer, whether it was your own or of loved ones
 Your stories have given me an extra dosage of strength and courage, and more importantly, the knowledge that I'm not alone
 Each day comes with its own challenges and victories and so for now, I‚Äôm taking this # onedayatatime
 The only thing I'm trying to be consistent about is carrying a positive outlook
 
 
 literally # switchonthesunshine - it‚Äôs my way of dealing with this
 Sharing my journey is also part of this process
 
 
 i can only hope it reminds you that all is not lost and that someone, somewhere understands what you‚Äôre going through
 ü§ûüåû Thank you @tomoarakawa for making this a chic transition from long to short! a post shared bysonali Bendre (@iamsonalibendre) onjul 10, 2018 at 12:20 am pdtfrom the moment he was born 12 years, 11 months and 8 days ago, my amazing @rockbehl took ownership of my heart
 From then on, his happiness and wellbeing have been the centre of anything @goldiebehl and i ever did
 And so, when the Big c reared its ugly head, our biggest dilemma was what and how we were going to tell him
 As much as we wanted to protect him, we knew it was important to tell him the full facts
 We've always been open and honest with him and this time it wasn't going to be different
 He took the news so maturely


 and instantly became a source of strength and positivity for me
 In some situations now, he even reverses roles and takes on being the parent, reminding me of things i need to do! i believe that it's imperative to keep kids involved in a situation like this
 They are a lot more resilient than we give them credit for
 It's important to spend time with them and include them, rather than make them wait on the side-lines, not being told yet instinctively knowing everything
 In our effort to protect them from the pain and realities of life, we might end up doing the opposite

 In fact, these statements of the Congress leader on the cost of food were given to justify the latest figures of the Planning Commission on poverty in the country

 Zhen, through his presentation, explained how pollution can be reduced - * Preventing dust from covering construction sites and using sprinklers first * Thereafter more than one million old vehicles were prevented from getting on the road * Public New buses were launched to improve transport, * Out of 1200 polluting industries out of the city, the technology used in them g to tell Diapako also casualties were subsidized by the Chinese government to reduce the use of coal Improve There are about 90 million vehicles in Delhi, which is every third vehicle

 brisben test se mahendra singh dhoni bataur captain vaapasi kar rahe hai, jo bharat kii ballebaazi ko bhi majboot karegaa or bataur captain dhoni kaa anubhav bhi team ke kaam aayega
 But the question is whether the board should not have looked to the future while retaining Virat Kohli as captain
 
 
 ? isamen koi do raay nahin ki yah pehle se tay tha ki viraat kohli pehle test main sirf dhoni kii anupasthiti main captain kii bhoomika nibhaayenge or dhoni kii vaapasi par unhen jagah khaali kerani hi thi, lekin kuch baaten hai, jo bataur captain kohli ke saath hi aage badhane ke sawaal ko uthaati hai
 For example
 
 
 lekin bhartiya board ne bhavishya kii taiyaariyon kii taraf dekhne kii bajaae vahi kiya, jisaki usase ummid thi
 If Dhoni had shown his heart in front of the board talking about continuing the captaincy of Kohli, it could have been done, but it did not happen

 Parliament's seal on reservation for upper castes: Some say 'political stunt', some 'cheat' on upper castes, 10 special things in judicial review despite various opposition parties including Congress in discussion on the bill on Wednesday In it, it was feared that it would get ticked and the example taken by the PV Narasimha Rao government in this regard was given

 tab pakistan apane sabase bure vakt se guzar rahaa tha
 Foreign aid had ceased after the withdrawal of American and NATO forces from Afghanistan
 nivesh nadaarad tha or arthvyavastha lagbhag dub chuki thi
 At the same time Pakistan distanced itself from the US and handed over its economic future to China and China placed economic bets on the world's most risky country
 pakistan ke ladaaku vimaanon ke aasamaani swaagat ke bich, april 2015 main china ke raashtrapati shi jinping islamabad pahunche or pakistan ke saath 46 arab dollar kii pariyojna (china pakistan aarthik coridor) par dastakhat ho gaye

 The diplomatic balance of South Asia changed as soon as the hustle and bustle of Chinese companies started in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 bhartiya kootneeti ko us aarthik sankat ke vakt, pakistan ko china kii sharan main jane se rokna tha
 There were two changes in Pakistan as it moved closer to China: One - Western countries had made only temporary strategic investments in Pakistan, China built economic infrastructure there

 Saudi Arabia is providing some help
 imran kii gurraahat bataati he ki agar bharat ke virodh kii vajah se pakistan ko iemef kii madad nahin mili to china he na
 Responding to Uri, India had announced crossing the Line of Control of moderation, but it has to be kept in mind that weapons pick up where diplomacy ends, so after Pulwama, Pakistan had to resort to diplomacy to surround it
 pakistan ko alag-thalag karnaa hi ek vikalp he or agar aakraamak kootneeti kii himmat ho to maukey abhi khatm nahin hue hai
 However the siege has to start from the east i
e
 from the Chinese side
 yadi aatank badhata rahaa to global mansoobon vaale china ke liye pakistan ke saath khadaa rahanaa mushkil hoga
 If China can be shown openly in favor of Pak terror at any forum (UN resolution on Masood Azhar), it will be a big success
 america ke saath sing fansaae or aarthik taur par pareshaan china ko is samay bhartiya bazaar kii jarurat he
 Can we use this opportunity? It is clear that now it is impossible to tighten Pakistan in the frameworks without engaging the eyes of China, say Roosevelt used to say less and keep the stick long, go far
 pakistan ko lekar vaajapeyi or modi kii uljhan ek jaisi he
 We have divided the entire foreign policy between embracing or firing
 kootneeti in donon ke bich khadi hoti he

 congress ne 22 saal main pehali baar gujarat main aise siyaasi sameekaran set kiye the, ki bijepi kaa koi bhi astr kaam nahin aa rahaa tha
 Rahul Gandhi had created a caste formula to siege against BJP through Gujarat's Yuva Trimurti, which was hoping to end the exile of Congress power in the state
 in sabake bich manishankar ayyar kii fisali jubaan ne bijepi ko sanjivani de di he
 Iyer's statement seems to spoil the Congress's victory in Gujarat
 manishankar ayyar ne guuruuvaar ko narendra modi ke liye 'neech' shabd kaa istemaal kiya
 After this, the BJP started putting the Congress in the dock with Iyer's statement
 haalanki, congress ne kuch ghante ke andar hi ayyar ko nilambit kar diya lekin jo siyaasi maahaul bananaa tha bijepi ne use hawa de di
 PM Narendra Modi said at the election rally in Surat, 'iyer says that Modi belongs to a low caste
 yegujarat kaa apmaanhai
 Those in Mughal rites do not bear to wear nice clothes like me
 aapane hamen gadhaa or gandi naalee kaa keedaa kaha
 On 18th, ballot papers will explain how the insult of the son of Gujarat is avenged
 'haalanki congress ne modi par aapattijanak tippanee karne vaale manishankar ayyar ko party kii praathmik sadsyta se nilambit kar diya he
 Also, a show cause notice has been issued in the case
 ayyar ke bayaan se sirf narendra modi or bijepi hi aahat nahin hui hai balki congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ke maathe par bhi paseene aa gaye
 Rahul Gandhi understands the political significance of Iyer's statement very well
 isiilie unhone twit kar bayaan kii ninda kii he or modi se maafee maangane kii baat bhi kahi
 Rahul Gandhi is aware that he has worked on the land of Gujarat for the last four months
 rajya main ventilator par congress main jaan dikhne lagi thi
 Rahul was trying to grow a political crop in Gujarat through Navsarjan Yatra
 congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi ne is baar gujarat ke ranbhumi main jaateey siyaasi bisaat bichaai thi
 The Congress had embarked on a dream of winning by combining the young Trimurti Hardik, Alpesh and Jignesh of Gujarat
 gujarat main patelon kii naaraazgi bijepi kii chintaa kaa sabab bana hua tha
 The Congress was involved in making a dent in the tribal and Dalit votes including the OBC, which upset the BJP
 bijepi kii lakh koshishon ke baavjood hindutv kii hawa nahin ban paa rahi thi
 Rahul Gandhi was on the path of soft Hindutva from the beginning
 isiilie bijepi kaa ye card bhi safalataa kaa paala chhu nahin paa rahaa tha
 PM Modi's Gujarat Asmita cards were running and were telling themselves as Gujarat's son
 iske baavjood unki reliyon se kahin zyada bheed hardik patel kii raily main jute rahi thi
 The BJP could not find a cut
 aise main manishankar ayyar ke bayaan ne bijepi ko brahmastra de diya he
 In the current era, the result of personal attack on Narendra Modi may cause trouble for the Congress
 kyonki modi par jab bhi vyaktigat hamale hue hai, usase wo or bhi majboot hue hai
 Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the same Mani Shankar Aiyar used the word 'chaiwala' for Modi
 bijepi ne ise mudda banaaya or congress kaa hashr kya hua he ye jagajaahir he
 In such a situation, Iyer's part has come once again in the political battle of Gujarat
 iskaa nateeja kya hoga

 There are many countries in the world where women are still living in worse conditions
 inhen main se ek desh he saudi arab
 Here women do not even have many basic rights 
 yah mudda soshal media par tab uchhla, jab vahaan mahilaon ke haq ke liye girls council kaa gathan kiya gaya
 But women were not made to sit together in the first first meeting of the council
 9 ajeeb paabandiyaan, jo saudi auraton par lagu hainvahaan mahilaon kii haalat kaa andaja aap isi baat se laga sakate hai unhen ghar se akele nikalne tak par pabandi he
 Know such rules, which you cannot even imagine
 1
 Without two male witnesses, no woman can buy property
 mjedaar baat to ye he ki purush gavaah ke bina mahilaon kii pahchaan kii pushti nahin hoti he
 Not only this, four more male witnesses are also needed to verify the credibility of the two men who come to confirm the woman
 2
 Women here do not participate in sports
 agar koi aisa kare to logon kaa gussa foot padataa he
 You will be surprised to know that for the first time the women players of Saudi Arabia took part in the 2012 Olympic Games
 lekin iske baad desh main kaaphi virodh hua tha
 The whole world had seen that at that time female athletes were seen in the Olympics with their entire bodies covered in clothes and running in hijab
 saudi arab main mahilaon kii aisi he LIFE3
 It is often said that Saudi Arabia has strict laws against rappers
 par sachai ye he ki yahaan rape badi sankhya main hote hai
 Perhaps you would not know that forcible relations with wife are not considered rape here
 duusari rape kii ghatnaon main kisi aaropee ko tab tak sajaa nahin di ja sakati, jab tak rape ke chaar chashmadid naa hon
 Therefore, it is a difficult task to prove rape there
 kuch maamle to aise bhi dekhe gaye hai ki agar mahila kaa rape ho or us samay vah akeli ghar se nikali ho yaa uske saath koi purush gargian naa ho, to use bhi sajaa di jaati he
 4
 vahaan mahilaayein akele safar nahin kar saktin
 It is necessary to have a male guardian with them
 yahi nahin, mahilaon ko safar karne ke liye purush kii sahmati kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The condition is that if a woman's husband is not alive, then she has to take written permission from her son
 5
 Every woman in Saudi must have a male guardian
 wo chaahe uskaa pita ho, yaa ankal, bhai, betaa
 6
 itnaa sab hone ke baavjood vahaan mahilaayein padhai ke maamle main purushon se aage hai
 But their number in the job is very less
 7
 There is no rule for women driving in Saudi Arabia but it is not considered good there
 kai virodh pradarshnon ke baad ab mahilaon ko keval bacchon ko skool chhodane or parivaar ke kisi sadasya ko aspataal pahunchane ke liye drive karne kaa adhikaar mil gaya he

 The fodder scam which is can be said that it would have turned into brotherhood if Lalu ji had compromised his DNA
 agar lalu ji bijepi ke saath haath mila lete, to yahi lalu ji raja harishchandra ban jate
 Tejashwi Yadav said that Nitish Kumar has played a big role in trapping Lalu ji
 wo jaanate the ki lalu ji agar rahenge to nitish kumaar kabhi bhi bihar ke mukhyamantri mantri nahin ban sakenge
 Nitish Kumar has conspired against Lalu ji with BJP
 tejasvi yadavane kaha ki bijepi or nitish kumaar ne karpuri thakur ko gaali dene kaa kaam kiya
