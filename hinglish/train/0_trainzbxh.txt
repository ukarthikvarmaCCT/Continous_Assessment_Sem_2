 Seeing the laughter of Kailash Vijayvargiya, a minister of Madhya Pradesh, it is understandable that even the death of journalist Akshay Singh could not distract him
 lekin yah ek aadmi kii nahin, us vyavastha kii, us vichaardhaara kii gadabadi he jo aisa aadmi banaati he
 Those who are distracted are also mildly distracted by sorrow
 jo nahin hote, ve do hazaar mauton se bhi nahin hote
 So in a way, this is a mess of our expectation from Kailash Vijayvargiya or his Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 ham kyon ummid karen ki jo log apane rajya ke ek viraat ghotaale par vichlit nahin hai, jin par aise ghotaale se jude logon ko prashray dene kaa bahut thos andeh he, jinpar aarope lagane vaale maare ja rahe hai, ve ek patrkaar kii maut se vichlit honge
 The truth is that perhaps the world of journalism is not distracted by his death
 ye hamaare samay main sabaki moti hoti chamadi kaa kamaal he ki koi bhi dard aisa nahin chubhta ki ham sab kuch bhul jaaen
 Like everything is driven by a business
 sabakuch is samaj se niklaa he ki yah ek pesha he jisamen baaki chizon kii tarah khabar bhi ek dhandhe kaa hissaa he
 The comments lekin khabaron kii duniya khataron kii duniya he, yah baat tab samaj main aati he, jab koi nadaan yaa jununee patrkaar aapasi hiton ke ankahe samjhaute ko todakar kuch aisa khojane nikalataa he jisamen vyavastha kii chulein hilti dikhen
 At such a turn, he is usually alone, innocent and sometimes even a victim of a suspicious death
 phir kuch log uskaa gungan karte hai, kuch log usase duuri baratate hai or kuch log chupchaap saavdhaan ho jate hai- ki us gali se nahin guzaranaa he, jahaan se wo guzara he
 But there is some magic, there is some charisma, some more foolish people come out who find the rift within this complete understanding where it is impossible to suppress the news
 loktantr kii ye na dikhne vaali awaazen hamaari asli takat hai- saare patan ke baavjood patrakarita kaa vah gaurav, jisase hansane vaale darate hai, use maarna chaahate hai lekin antat: apni hi gardan par kas rahe fande ko kuch or majboot kar daalate hai
 So in a way, this is a mess of our expectation from Kailash Vijayvargiya or his Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 ham kyon ummid karen ki jo log apane rajya ke ek viraat ghotaale par vichlit nahin hai, jin par aise ghotaale se jude logon ko prashray dene kaa bahut thos andeh he, jinpar aarope lagane vaale maare ja rahe hai, ve ek patrkaar kii maut se vichlit honge

 The comments lekin khabaron kii duniya khataron kii duniya he, yah baat tab samaj main aati he, jab koi nadaan yaa jununee patrkaar aapasi hiton ke ankahe samjhaute ko todakar kuch aisa khojane nikalataa he jisamen vyavastha kii chulein hilti dikhen
 At such a turn, he is usually alone, innocent and sometimes even a victim of a suspicious death

 It is a wonder of everyone's thick skin in our time that no pain pricks such that we forget everything
 sab kuch jaise ek kaarobaar se sanchalit he
 Everything has come out of the understanding that this is a profession in which news, like everything else, is part of a business
 tippaniyan But the world of news is a world of dangers, this is understood when an innocent or obsessive journalist breaks out of mutual agreement of mutual interest to find something in which the cradle of the system can be seen moving
 aise kisi mode par zyaadaatar vah akelaa hota he, nirih hota he or kabhi-kabhi kisi sandigdh maut kaa shikaar bhi ho jaataa he
 Then some people praise him, some people keep distance from him and some people become silently careful not to go through the street from where he has passed
 lekin koi jaadu hota he, koi karishma hota he, kuch or nadaan log nikal aate hai jo is puri samajhadaari ke bheetar kii vah daraar khoj lete hai jahaan se khabaron ko dabaanaa naammumkin hota he
 These inexplicable voices of democracy are our real strength - despite all the downfall, that pride of journalism, which the laughing people are afraid of, wants to kill it, but in the end, they tighten the noose on their own neck
 lekin khabaron kii duniya khataron kii duniya he, yah baat tab samaj main aati he, jab koi nadaan yaa jununee patrkaar aapasi hiton ke ankahe samjhaute ko todakar kuch aisa khojane nikalataa he jisamen vyavastha kii chulein hilti dikhen
 At such a turn, he is usually alone, innocent and sometimes even a victim of a suspicious death
 phir kuch log uskaa gungan karte hai, kuch log usase duuri baratate hai or kuch log chupchaap saavdhaan ho jate hai- ki us gali se nahin guzaranaa he, jahaan se wo guzara he

 aswin ne kaha- yakeenan us test match main maine apana best pradarshan karne kii koshish kii, lekin ummid ke mukabik nattejey nahin mil paae
 Boria Majumdar asked Ashwin - were you 100% fit in Southampton, to which Ashwin said - there is no question of being 100% fit or not in cricket

 test match main daaen haath ke ballebaajon ke liye of stump ke baahar kaaphi kuch karnaa tha, lekin ham ise nahin kar sake
 i always felt that if i tried to play through pads or bat-pads, i might have been right, but personally i believe that we could not do it and it was extremely frustrating
 aswin ne jab poocha gaya ki kya aapako lagata he ki bharat australia main acha karegi
 Ashwin said - it will be too much to compare all the teams
 har team apana sarvshereshth pradarshan karne ke makasad se daure par jaati he
 Talking about the great Indian teams, Ashwin said - India won the series in England in 2007 and when we won for the first time in Perth in 2008, every team had its own identity
 ravi shastri vaale bayaan par aswin ne kaha- agar dressing room se yah baat aati hai to unka makasad team ke aatmavishvaas ko banaae rakhana he

 Ashwin said that when we were going to start the series in England, we were confident that we had good chances of winning
 zyaadaatar log yah maanate hai ki scoreboard yah nahin dikhaata ki hamane khel dikhaaya
 As a cricketer i would like to say that we have played some good cricket, but we had a great chance of winning which we could not take advantage of with both hands
 mehmaan team or mejabaan team ke bich antar hota hi he, gharelu team ko khel ke har vibhaag main acha khel dikhaanaa hota he

 While talking on Hardik Pandya, this Ashwin said - Hardik is not rood and is very humble
 hardik ek acha baccha he
 Ashwin said- There is pressure before the match against Pakistan, because it has a lot of people's emotions attached to it
 aswin ne kaha- ab samay badal gaya he or pakistan ke khilaaf pressure ko kam karne ke liye sirf ise ek game kaa naam diya jaataa he
 Regarding the match with Pakistan after the Champions Trophy final in 2017, r Ashwin said, "I believe that we are a much stronger team than other teams in the world

 DNA test will be done to sort out the death of Lina Singh Sharma, former US Embassy employee
 hoshangabad ke espi ashutosh pratap singh ne is babat aadesh jari kiye hai
 For this, action has been taken to get a sample of the family
 vahiin, is hatyakand main istemaal kii gai tractor-trali, lathi or pathar bhi jabt kar liya gaya he
 All the items have been recovered from the house in Doodadeh village of Pradeep Sharma, the accused in this case
 police kii jaanch jari he
 According to the information, the body of Lina missing from Delhi was recovered from the forest of Satpura in Hoshangabad, Madhya Pradesh
 vah apni paitruk jameen kaa simakan karaane ke liye 28 april ko dilli se bhopal gai thi
 She left for her house after being near her friend one day, but her mobile switch was turned off
 iske baad is hatyakand kaa khulaasa hua tha
 Leena lived in the Bansatkunj area of delhi
 vah madhya pradesh ke sohagpur kii rahane vaali thi
 Leena Murder Mystery of Hoshangabad is reminiscent of the recent crime thriller Darsham
 thik drishyam film kii tarah hi yahaan bhi kaatilon ne police ko uljhane ke liye leena ke katl ke baad uskaa mobile phone ek paisanger train main phenk diya tha
 So that the location of the phone baffles the police
 lekin ittefaq se ye mobile police ko mauka-e-vaardaat se kareeb 30 kilometre dur hi ek ladke ke paas se mil gaya
 The episodes of murder continued to join
 shaayad yahi reel or real life kaa fark bhi he
 The 38-year-old Lina had ancestral land worth crores in Dudadeh in her village Hoshangabad
 lekin is par khud leena ke mamaa pradin sharma ne nazren gadaaye rakhi thi
 a fight between maternal uncle and niece was going on
 katl se pehle leena khud dilli se chal kar pehle bhopal gai or phir bhopal se 29 april ko apni zamin kaa simakan karwaane pushtaini gaanv dudadeh, lekin yahi din uski jindagi kaa aakhri din sabit hua
 She had just reached demarcation that maternal uncle again came in the way
 pehle to donon ke bich jamkar kahasuni hui or phir pradeep sharma ne apane do naukaron gorelaal or rajendra kumre ke saath milakar leena ko peet-peet kar or galaa ghont kar maut ke ghat utaar diya
 But the cold-blooded act was carried out with a cold mind, after which the conspiracy to confuse the police was carried out in an equally vicious manner
 leena kii gumshudagi ko hameshaa-hameshaa ke liye ek raaj banaae rakhane ke liye unhone jo sajeesh rachi, us tak pahunch kar khud police bhi hairaan rah gai
 The murderer had a perfect murder plan
 doston ne fasebuk par chalaai muhimadilli kii leena yahaan se 861 kilometre dur hoshangabad main gum ho chuki thi
 His mobile phone was also mysteriously switched off
 lekin naa to hoshangabad main rahanevaali uski bahan hema mishra ko uski phikr thi naa hi uske mamaa pradeep sharma ko
 Neither of them walked on their behalf and approached the police to complain about his disappearance
 lekin bhopal main baithe leena ke doston ne use dhundhane kii koshish main fasebuk par muhim kii shuruyaat kii, to gharavaale harakat main aae
 Six days after the disappearance of Suleena on suspicion of police resting on her maternal uncle, Pradeep Sharma, her maternal uncle, wrote a report about Leena's disappearance at Sohagpur police station in Hoshangabad
 lekin jab police ne pradeep sharma se leena ko lekar sawaal-jawaab kii shuruyaat kii, to mamaa ne kai aisi baaten kahin, jisase police ke shaq kii sui us par tik gai
 Despite Leena's disappearance for so many days, she had no clear answer to remain silent
 pradeep sharma ne bataaya ki leena aakhri baar kisi car main uske gaanv pahunchi thi
 Autowala opened Mama's Rajpolis During the investigation, one such autowala was found who told that he himself had left Leena in his auto till the village
 aise main sawaal ye tha ki akhir leena ke mamaa ne uske gaanv main aane ko lekar jhooth kyon bolaa? upar se dilli or bhopal se leena ke dost lagaataar police ko phone kar uske mamaa or bahan par leena ko gaayab karne kaa shaq jataa rahe the
 Like Pradeep Sharma, his two servants Gorelal and Rajendra Kumare's responses also had contradiction
 police kaa shaq yakeen kii ore badha
 In this way, the conspiracy for the murder was taken and the two servants were detained and questioned by the law, so it did not take long for the plot to be revealed
 jald hi mamaa pradeep sharma bhi salaakhon ke peeche pahunch chukaa tha
 But after listening to the story he told, the policemen also got shocked
 mamaa ne apane naukaron ke saath leena ko maut ke ghat utaarne ke baad laash to ghaney jangal main thikaane laga hi di thi
 To confuse the police, his mobile phone was also thrown into a passenger train passing by near the forest

 This kind of content should not be aired
 The producer must stop this nonsense
 — Phutarmal Jain (@pppjain)february 9, 2019I want to ask the makers of # kulfikumarbajewalathat how is it ok to show that mature adults are constantly traumatising a child?the content of the serial is extremely disturbing
 And people actually watch the show! God! 🙄— June (@junielovesbts) February 5, 2019what are u trying to show us @ starpluswith Ur current track in # Kulfikumarbajewalashame on u to such negative track where a mom is teaching such rong things to her daughter and doesn't mind playing with her own daughter's living sho jabase oner hua he tiarapy chart main acchhee ranking par bana hua he
 Kulfi and Amaira's relationship with Sikander in the show is heart touching
 bihar kii raajnneeti par maharashtra kaa asarabijepi-jediu kii dosti par pad saktaa he prabhavabihar main agle saal vidhansabha kaa chunaav he
 The impact of Maharashtra's politics can also be seen on Bihar as the 30-year-old BJP and Shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra broke down on the post of Chief Minister, in such a way it can also have an impact on BJP and JDU alliance in Bihar
 kyonki maharashtra ke raajnneetik ghatnakram ne kai bhram tod die hai
 The first is that the post or pre-agenda is no longer meaningful 
 doosraa partiyaan apane rajnatik swaarth ko puraa karne main apane siddhant or vichaardhaara ko tilanjali dene main ab deree nahin kar rahi hai
 NITISHHALAN: The face of NDA in Bihar is slightly different in Bihar
 yahaan bijepi ne pehle se hi nitish kumaar ko endie kaa cheharaa ghoshit kar rakhaa he isliye mukhyamantri pad ko lekar koi vivaad nahin hona chahie
 But the matter may get stuck due to the seat sharing
 donon dalon ne vidhansabha kaa pichhlaa chunaav 2010 main ek saath ladaa tha
 At that time JDU contested on 142 seats and BJP on 101 seats
 iske baad 2013 main jediu ne bijepi se alag hokar 2014 kaa loksabhaa or 2015 kaa vidhansabha chunaav ladaa
 Since 2017, the two parties are together again and everything is going on as before
 2013 se pehle jediu kii bhoomika bihar main bade bhai kii thi lekin 2014 ke loksabhaa main jediu ko gaharaa dhakka lagane ke baad 2019 kaa loksabhaa chunaav donon dalon ne barabari par ladaa tha
 Therefore, it is believed that in the assembly elections, only a firm formula of equality can be applied
 seat bantwaare ko lekar funs saktaa he penchbihar vidhansabha kii 243 siton par 2015 ke vidhansabha chunaav main mahagathbandhan main shaamil jediu ne 101, argedy ne 101 or congress ne 41 siton par chunaav ladaa
 It is believed that this time in Bihar, this will be the seat-sharing formula between JDU BJP and LJP
 chunkiloksabhaa chunaav main bijepine apane hisse kii paanch siten jediu ko di thi isliye bijepi ke paas barabari par chunaav ladane kaa tark bhi he
 Now everything depends on how much JDU executes it
 lekin agar jediu baraabar siton par chunaav ladane kaa faisla karti he to yah uske liye or nitish kumaar ke liye khatre kii ghanti hogi
 In any case, JDU will try to contest more seats than BJP so that it has more mlas
 tamaam tarkon or badali hui paristhitiyon main bhi jediu kam se kam 142 nahin to 120 siton par jarur chunaav ladanaa chaahegi
 The strike rate will be important if both the parties contest the same number of seats and if both parties have the majority number of figures, then the real game can happen even after the elections
 yahaan sabakuch nirbhar kar saktaa he strike rate par, jis party kaa strike rate zyada hoga, jiske paas zyada siten hogin wo sarkaar banane kaa daawa kar sakati he
 If more JDU mlas win, Nitish Kumar will unquestionably be the next Chief Minister of Bihar if the bjp's strike rate is higher as seen in the 2010 Assembly and 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then the matter may change
 is haalat main algepi kii bhoomika nirnaayak hogi
 Under the central politics, it is clear that the LJP will be more inclined towards the BJP
 aise main bijepi bhi apane pattey khel sakati he
 Questioning the credibility of coalition religion in this way, the politics of Maharashtra has put a question mark on the credibility of coalition religion
 gathbandhan main hone ke baavjood rajnatik partiyaan ek duusare par vishwaas nahin kar rahi he
 There is no delay in giving up theories and ideologies in the greed for power
 kya pataa chunaav ke baad kuch aisi paristhiti ban jaae ki bijepi or argedy milakar sarkaar bana le jaise ki maharashtra main shivasena ke saath milakar congress or ensipi sarkaar bana rahi he
 Or else JDU then form government with RJD and Congress

 antarrashtriya nyaayalay (ICJ) ne kulbhushan jadhav maamle main jawaab daakhil karne ke liye nai taarikh kaa elaan kar diya he
 The statement issued by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands said that in the Jadhav case, India will have to file its written reply on 17 April 2018, while Pakistan will have to file its reply by 17 July 2018
 antarrashtriya nyaayalay ne jadhav maamle main bharat va pakistan ke paksh jaanane or cese kii sthiti ko dekhte hue yah faisla liya he
 Earlier, on May 18, 2017, a 10-member bench of the International Court of Justice stopped Pakistan from serving Jadhav's sentence until a decision was taken in the matter
 ise pakistan ke liye karaara jhatka mana gaya tha
 The United Nations Principal Judicial Body issued a statement last week authorizing Pakistan to respond and then reply to India in the Jadhav case
 bayaan main kaha gaya ki adaalat ne in likhit daleelon ke liye bharat ko 17 april 2018 or pakistan ko 17 july 2018 kii taarikh di he
 According to the statement, the International Court of Justice has taken this decision keeping in mind the views of both the parties and the circumstances of the case

 It is known that Pakistan had sentenced former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav to death for the alleged spying
 haalanki bharat kaa kahana he ki pakistan ne kulbhushan jadhav ko iran se agava karaayaa tha
 The charge of spying on them is also fabricated

 Whose Taj Mahal? This question was raised in the Lok Sabha today and members of the ruling party said, 'ours is the Taj', while some members sitting on the opposition side said, is everyone's crown? When Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma was answering the questions asked regarding museums, Asaduddin Owaisi of AIMIM asked, whose crown is this? Dharmendra Yadav of Samajwadi Party was asking supplementary questions regarding museums, when Owaisi, sitting on the seat next to him, again said, whose crown is this? The minister, however, did not pay any heed to this question and he continued to answer the members' questions

 bukamp prabhavit japan main parmaanu pratishthanon kii suraksha ko lekar jahaan ashankaayen jataayi ja rahi hai, vahiin bharat ke parmaanu urja ayog ke purv adhyaksh anil kakodakar ne somvaar ko kaha ki bhartiya parmaanu sanyantr surakshit hai
 However, Kakodkar said that after the current crisis in Japan, the design of plants around the world will improve
 mumbai ke vidhaan bhawan sthit ve es paage sansadeey prashikshan centre main hue parmaanu urja ke mahatv vishyak vyaakhyaan main unhone kaha ki japan kaa phukushima parmaanu sanyantr surakshit tha lekin vahaan visphot isaliye hua kyonki tsunami ke chalate pani bhar jane ke baad vahaan kii shitalan pranali kaam nahin kar rahi thi
 Kakodkar said, however, that the situation is still sensitive and full assessment will be available only after some time
 unhone kaha ki bharat ke parmaanu sanyantr surakshit hai
 The former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission said, there is a difference between geopolitical movements in Japan and India
 bhuj main bukamp ke baad :gujarat sthit: kakarapaar sanyatra kaam kar rahaa tha or dakshin bharat main tsunami ke baad pani bhar jane ke chalate :tamilnaadu sthit: kalapakkam sanyantr band kar diya gaya tha

 The Supreme Court itself has decided to bring the Chief Justice of India (CJI) under the purview of Right to Information (RTI)
 yah ek durlabh kism kaa maamla tha jisamen hoicourt ke khilaaf khud supreme court ne supreme court kaa darwaja khatkhataya tha or supreme court ne supreme court kii arji nistaaran karte hue bharat ke mukhya nyaayadhish ko artiai ke tahat laane kaa nirnay sunaaya lekin isamen kuch sharten bhi lagaayee
 The conditions are that RTI will not be used as a watchdog, for which reason the Collegium has decided the names, information will not be available
 saath hi jajon se judi jaankaree or sarkaar se samvaad kii jaankariyaan saajha kerani hongi lekin ye cese dar cese tay kiya jayega
 It will be up to the judges to make the information of the assets of the judges public
 lekin isamen bhi janhit or jaankaree maangane kaa makasad dekha jayega
 Overall, taking information from the CJI office would be a crooked task as the task of proving public interest will be on the person seeking information, as well as the Supreme Court will decide the public interest at its level
 is faisle main janhit or nijee jaankariyon par court ne dilachasp tippaniyan kii hai
 It is also important to know that common people calculate their personal information within a very limited range
 lekin ye data kaa yug he or isamen aapkaa data bik saktaa he isliye nijee jaankariyon kaa dayera samajhnaa jaruri he
 The Supreme Court held that judicial citations prove that the name, address, physical, mental and psychological status, table, grade, answer book are personal information
 isi tarah profeshnal records jinamein yogyata, parfarmens, moolyankan report, asiaar, anushaasanamak karrwai bhi vyaktigat jaankaree he
 Not only this, medical records, treatment, medicine of choice, list of hospitals and doctor's consultation, investigation report which includes information of family, assets information, liability, income tax return, details of investment, loan lending etc
 Is private information
 aisi nijee soochnaaon ko anadhikrut tareeke se hasil karnaa niztaa kaa ulanghan he
 In the wider public interest, the way to access these information is open with certain conditions
 court ne kaha ki yah suchi ek namoona he, anantim nahin
 Similarly, the court has also explained the public interest that it means public welfare
 janakalyaan or janata kii dilchaspee main bahut bada fark he
 The court said that these two are completely different criteria
 udhaaharan ke liye logon kii dilchaspee kisi ke nijee masalon main ho sakati he lekin mumkin he ki uskaa janakalyaan se koi lenaa-dena na ho lekin use jaahir karne kaa dabaav pade
 Issues related to the interest of such people should be dismissed as they come in the way of protection of privacy
 adaalat ne kaha ki in udaahranon ko dene kaa makasad vyakti ke niztaa ke adhikaar se judi uski pratishtha or sammaan kii raksha karnaa he
 The court said that judicial independence should also be taken care of in sharing of information
 saath hi ye bhi kaha ki soochnaaon ko dene se inkaar karne se nyaayik swatantraaa nahin hasil ho jaati
 This decision to bring the CJI within the purview of the right to information, on the top, seems to be a great move, but its intricacies are hidden in the slightest terms
 aap kya jaankariyaan maangenge ye to aap tay kar sakate hai lekin sijei kii taraf se kya jaankariyaan uplabdh karai jaaengi ye har maamle ke hisaab se tay hoga
 Right now the judiciary in India has a long way to go in becoming independent and democratic
 accodhya prakaran kii live strimming kii maang ko supreme court se hui thi jo ki puri nahin hui
 If the Supreme Court really wants to bring transparency, then like the Parliament, take the initiative of live streaming first and this initiative should also be in the High Court
 janata soochnaaon se zyada is baat ko jaananaa chaahati he ki adaalat ke bheetar hota kya he
 If the public sees the eyes of the court, then the target of both public interest and public interest will be achieved
 *** Do you know that there is a whole racket of leaking confidential government information and every kind of document has different prices

 -sandip unnithan, anshuman tiwari or kowshik deka National Advisory Committee (NAC) member NC Saxena, while supporting the hike in petrol price, said that it would not have any special effect on inflation
 haalanki kuch visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki keemat badhaane kii jarurat nahin thi
 NC Saxena, a member of the NAC led by Sonia Gandhi, said, "the increase in the price of petrol will have a partial effect on inflation
 hamaari parivahan pranali puri tarah se dijal par nirbhar he

 However, CP Chandrasekhar, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said that the price of petrol would have an impact on the budget of the common man
 unhone kaha, ‘petrol ek mahatvapurn madhyamik utpaada bhi he
 It is included in the cost of production of all types of things

 Anil Ambani-led Reliance Power on Tuesday said that it has terminated the contract for the Rs 36,000-crore Tilaiya High Power Project (UMPP) in Jharkhand due to the extremely delayed land acquisition
 company ne 1
 In August 2009, the right to set up a 3,960 MW power plant at Hazaribagh, Jharkhand, by bidding a power rate of Rs 77 per unit was acquired, but the company could not start work on the project as the state government provided the required land even after five years
 Did not get it done
 company ne ek bayaan jari kar kaha ki reliance power kii purna swaamitv vaali anushanbee jharkhand integrated power limited ne ‘‘hazaribagh jile main apni 3,960 megawatt kii tilaiya ati vrihad bijli pariyojna kaa bijli kharid samjhauta (pipie) khatm kar diya he
 '' pariyojna ke kriyanvayan ke liye sthapit vishesh company jharkhand integrated power ne 10 rajyon main 25 varshon ke liye 18 bijli kritaon ke saath pipie par hastakshar kiya tha
 The project was based on private coal blocks for which coal was to be purchased from the Carenderi BC coal mine block

 aam aadmi party in dinon bade vivaad ke kendra main he or uske mantri somnath bharti usase bhi zyada vivaadon ke ghere main hai
 There is a deep connection between the controversy and the Aam Aadmi Party
 chaahe vah kumaar vishwaas ke bayaan hon yaa kumari birla kii car kaa sheesha tuutane kaa prakaran, party kai tarah ke vivaadon main fansati rahi he lekin vah sab chote-mote vivaad the jinhen tool dena uchit nahin hoga
 But the manner in which Somnath Bharti tried to raid and threaten the policemen in Delhi's window village is a sad incident in itself
 sudur africa se bharat main padhai karne yaa phir do vakt kii roti kamaane aae logon par bina saboot ke veshyavriti or drug kaarobaar kaa aarope lagaana kitna anuchit he, vah shaayad bhul gaye
 As a lawyer, he will also have knowledge of the law which says that a woman cannot be arrested by male policemen
 yah jaanate hue bhi unhone bade afsaraana andaaj main police ko unhen giraftaar karne kaa hukum diya
 When he refused, he landed on Dadagiri
 baat yaheen tak khatm ho jaati to shaayad thik tha
 Arvind Kejriwal, the head of his party, started a huge movement to prove him right
 kejariwal ne is ghatana ke alaava denmark se ai ek mahila ke saath balaatkaar kaa maamla bhi uthaa diya
 Somnath Bharti's role in this case has also been shameful
 unhone peedita kaa naam hi zaahir kar diya jo kanoon galat he
 After looking at both these cases, it seems that the law knowledge of the Law Minister is weak
 ek vakil itani badi galtiyaan kaise kar saktaa he?lekin in sab par pardaa daalkar vah andolan main shaamil ho gaye
 They should have stopped Arvind Kejriwal
 lekin apni dadaageeri barkaraar rakhane ke liye unhone is maamle ko khub tool diya
 If he wanted, he could have resolved the matter in more ways but he did not think it appropriate to do so
 shaayad vah yah soch rahe the ki isse vah shahar main apana dabadabaa or badha sakenge
 To keep his height in front of his supporters, he fueled the movement
 hairaani kii baat yah he ki aam aadmi party apane mantri kaa bachaav karti dikh rahi he or police ke khilaaf shikaayat kar rahi he
 If the leader of the other party had done this, would Kejriwal have kept quiet? He has been at the forefront of casting blame on others
 vah aisa avasar nahin ganvaate
 But now that his own ministers are surrounded by allegations, an FIR has been filed against him and he is being accused of racism, so why are Kejriwal talking about purity and zero tolerance in politics? So the international image of India fighting racism around the world has deteriorated
 kejariwal ko turant somnath bharti se istipha maang lenaa chahie or unhen jaanch puri ho jane tak baithne ke liye kahana chahie
 It is also necessary for an impartial inquiry to resign
 yah naitikta kaa bhi takaza he

 CBI said till date 25 lakh rupees have been given on the order of the Supreme Court
 vahiin, peedita ke vakil ne kaha ki muaavja dete vakt is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa janaa chahie ki is rape ke baad peedita ke pita kii maut ho chuki he, sadak durghatana main wo pita ke baad parivaar ke do anya logon ko kho chuki he
 Apart from this, the victim has to leave Unnao to save her life and she is living in a rented house in Delhi

 At this, Sanger's lawyer said in defense that Sanger has two daughters who are eligible for marriage
 isliye agar peedita ko muaavja diya jaae to wo senger kii taraf se na diya jaae
 Sanger's lawyer gave this argument
 Counsel for Sangerdeep Sanger, while arguing on the sentence, argued that the public has elected him MLA 4 times
 gramin ilaake main unhone logon ke kaaphi kaam kiye hai, ganga nadi par unhone pul banwaaya, skool khulwaaye, apane ilaake main ITI banavaai
 Unfortunately, except for this one case, his entire political career and public life has been glorious, so Kuldeep Sengar should be punished to a minimum
 saath hi ye bhi kaha gaya ki senger kii do betiyaan he, jinaki shaadi honi he isliye muaavja senger kii taraf se na dilaayaa jaae
 These sections have resulted in conviction of expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar under 120B (criminal conspiracy), 363 (kidnapping), 366 (kidnapping or harassment of woman for marriage), 376 (rape and other related sections) and POCSO has gone
 bataa den ki is cese ke saamne aane ke kaaphi vakt baad bijepi ne senger ko party se nishkasit kar diya tha
 There is a provision to give a minimum sentence of 7 years and a maximum of 10 years of rigorous punishment to the convict once the crime is proved against Sanger

 Despite these contradictions, there is no doubt that Lalu and Paswan seem fully committed to implementing the alliance
 abhi tak, ye donon netaa chunavi phaayde ke liye jatigat dhruvikaran kaa laabh lene main safal hote aae hai
 If you look at the context of the Lok Sabha elections 2009, the situation seems a bit different as the Muslim, Mahadalit and highly backward class can find a strong alternative in the form of Nitish Kumar
 udhaaharan ke liye, abhi tak sambhawatah muslim lalu or paswan kaa hi samarthan karte aae hai lekin agar gahan adhyayan kiya jaae to ve is baar ''behatar saude'' ke liye nitish kumaar ke saath ja sakate hai
 The message is clear, no one party or coalition can always claim representation of a caste or community in political flow because they will not give you the opportunity to take them lightly
 or yahi kaaran he ki lalu or paswan 2009 ke aam chunaavon ke chalate apane rukh ko lekar vyaavhaarik ho gaye hai
 Similarly, in the neighboring state of Jharkhand, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has decided to continue with the UPA in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections
 uske is faisle ne sabko hairat main daal diya he kyonki congress or rajd ne shibu sorain ke mukhyamantri pad se hatane ke baad jhamumo ke mukhyamantri pad ke sabhi ummidavaaron ko sire se khaarij kar diya tha jiske chalate rajya main upie main daraar paidaa ho gai thi
 JMM had tightened its stand a fortnight ago and said that it would field a candidate against RJD in Bihar's tribal Bahul Pocket
 isi bich jhamumo ke bhaajapa main shaamil hone ke sanket bhi mili
 On this, the UPA leadership started acting on the policy of appeasement
 iske tahat jharkhand vidhansabha ko bhang nahin kiya gaya, jisase jharkhand ke sheersh pad par kabiz hone kii sorain kii ummid jinda he
 Perhaps this is the reason that forced the JMM chief to settle the account
 isse bhi aage, lalu ne 9 march ko us samay ghaavon par maraham lagane kaa kaam kiya jab vah nai dilli sthit ames main sorain se milane pahunche
 Eventually all the grievances were dispelled and the JMM announced to remain with the UPA
 lekin yah baat bhi gaur karne laayak he ki kuch samay pehle hi sorain ne vaada kiya tha ki ve lalu ko rajnatik sabak sikhaakar rahenge
 But these three allies of the alliance know that this time in the state they have to conquer a more difficult peak than last time
 2004 ke loksabhaa chunaav main gathbandhan ne rajya kii 14 main se 12 siton par vijay hasil kii thi
 The BJP had to be content with only one seat, which later went out of favor with MP Babu Lal Marandi forming the Jharkhand Development Party
 is baar bhi siton kaa bantwaaraa 2004 kii tarj par hoga, chaar siten jhamumo, chah siten congress or do siten rajd ke liye
 UPA allies in Jharkhand are yet to settle on the seats won by CPI and Marandi
 sanyog se, bijedy ke bhaajapa se dur jane ke baad jhamumo ke congress ke paale main aane se congress ko yah sandesh bhejne main madad mili ki upie zyada badhiya vikalp he
 However, this claim is yet to be proved in reality
 lekin jharkhand main bhaajapa josh main he, iskaa ek kaaran rajya main upie kaa kharaab prashasan he
 Since the 2005 Jharkhand assembly elections, independent legislators have wielded power
 haalanki yah kaha ja saktaa he ki upie gathbandhan ke ekajute hone se bhaajapa ke liye sab kuch aasaan nahin rahane vaala
 According to political observers, the bjp's failure to live up to the promises of the common man had a profound impact on the 2004 Lok Sabha election results
 lekin ab paristhitiyaan kaaphi badal chuki hai
 However Soren's son Durga Soren has emerged as a hindrance
 durga ne congress or rajd netaaon se kaha he ki vah guruji ke saath chunavi gathbandhan karne se pehle jharkhand ke mukhyamantri pad ke liye jhamumo ke ummidavaar kaa samarthan karen
 At the same time, Congress MP Furkan Ansari, who met Durga, expressed confidence that the alliance with JMM would continue
 jammu-kashmir ko vishesh adhikaar dene vaale anuchhed 35e kii vaidhata ko lekar supreme court main is hafte sunwaayee ho sakati he
 After the martyrdom of 40 soldiers in the Pulwama attack, it is believed that the attitude of the Modi government at the center may change on the issue
 aise main jammu-kashmir kii purv mukhyamantri mahabuuba mufti ne aag se na khilne kii chetavanee dete hue kaha ki yadi anuchhed 35e par hamalaa kiya gaya to unhen nahin pataa ki kashmir ke log tirange ke bajaay koun sa jhanda uthaa lenge
 Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said, 'do not play with fire, do not play banquet of 35A
 agar aisa hua to aap wo dekhenge jo 1947 se ab tak nahin hua he
 If it is attacked, i do not know what flag the people of Jammu and Kashmir will be forced to hold instead of the tricolor
 ' isse pehle neshnal conference ke netaa umr abdulla ne kaha tha ki centre or rajyapal kii sirf ek jimmedaari banati he ki ve chunaav karaaen or logon ko faisla lene den
 The new government will decide on its own to save Article 35A
 gauratlab he ki jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 35e kii vaidhanik manyata ko chunauti dene vaali kai yachikaaon par supreme court main sunwaayee pehle se hi chal rahi he
 But after the Pulwama attack, the demand for the removal of Article 370 and Article 35A once again has gained momentum
 haalanki jammu-kashmir prashasan ne supreme court main ek din pehle apana rukh saaf kiya he ki anuchhed 35e par sirf chuni hui sarkaar hi faisla le sakati he
 What is Article 35A? Article 35A empowers the legislative assembly of Jammu and Kashmir to decide the definition of permanent citizen in the state
 iske anusaar jammu-kashmir se baahar kaa koi bhi vyakti yahaan achal sampatti nahin kharid saktaa
 Along with this, even if an outsider marries a woman here, he cannot have any right over property
 14 may 1954 ko desh pehle raashtrapati dow
 Article 35A was added to the Constitution on the orders of Rajendra Prasad
 yah aadesh maharaja hari singh or bharat sarkaar ke bich hue samjhaute ke tahat diya gaya tha
 The President made a provision of Article 35A through Article 370 (1) (d) of the Constitution
 iske mutabik raashtrapati jammu-kashmir ke hit main kuch khaas 'apwaadon or parivartanon' ko lekar faisla lene ke liye swatantra hai
 Many believe that due process was not followed to add Article 35A to the Constitution
 kyonki samvidhan main anuchhed 35e ke liye samvidhan sanshodhan kaa kanoon paas nahin karaayaa gaya tha
 Bihar's litmus test is in Bihar where assembly elections are due this year

 Even when the JD (U) contested with the BJP, the main issue was that there should be a government that established the rule of law and the BJP always carried forward that evolutionary thinking while under the rule
 aaj punaru bihar ko sushasan vaali sarkaar kii aavashyaktaa he or bijepi hi sabase behatar vikalp he
 The grand alliance of RJD-JD (U) was held in Bihar and now its merger is also discussed
 kaise muqabla karenge?mahagathjod banane ke baad loksabhaa ke chunaav aae or jharkhand vidhansabha kaa chunaav hua
 Since Mahagathjod is a nexus of lack of leadership on any ideological basis, any sound good governance policy and credibility
 dilli kii tarah kya bihar main party koi cheharaa saamne rakh chunaav ladegi?har pradesh ke chunaav kaa apana tarika hota he, abhi sab vishyon par nirnay kaa adhikaar bijepi sansadeey board ke paas he
 The state unit is working as the team Bihar with a target of 185 seats, the only strategy right now
 haal hi main netritv ko lekar kaaphi bayaanbaji hui
 How to stop factionalism? There is no such topic and there is no factionalism within the party
 kabhi kisi ke bayaan ko press ne tod-marod kar pesh kiya to alag baat he, lekin party forum par sabane sthiti spasht kar di he
 The impact of Delhi Assembly election results will be seen on Bihar elections? Election results always have a positive effect
 bihar main jati factor chunaav main kaam karata he
 What will be the strategy? People of all societies and classes have equal representation in BJP
 ham sabhi virgon kaa saamaajik santulan rakhte hue ek sarv-samaveshi vikaas ke model ko apni sarkaar ke rup main prastut karte hai
 Despite the Modi wave, the BJP had to face defeat in the assembly by-election three months later
 kya kasar rah gai thi?sabhi vishyon par party lagaataar ek jeevant party ke rup main seva kaa kaam karti he
 Whatever the outcome, all the results are reviewed and we consider that dialogue, coordination and participation in the party remains with the public
 isliye sabakaa vishleshan karke hi ranneetiyon kaa sanchaalan karte hai
 The community you come from plays an important role in the politics of Bihar and if Lalu Yadav claims that vote, will the party bet more on Yadav faces? i work as a committed worker of a party
 mujhe jo bhi daayitv diya gaya, vah party ke sheersh netritv kaa nirnay he
 But as far as Lalu Yadav is concerned, people know how much work he has done
 saare myth tuutane vaale hai, samaaj ek nai disha or parivartan kii ore jane vaala he
 For the first time in Jharkhand, BJP replaced a tribal with a backward class leader
 kya bihar main bhi myth todenge?abhi siem ke liye koi vichaar nahin hua he or na hi abhi yah koi vishay he

 i do not feel bad when the big names of the film world are restless only for their 'brothers'
 sabko unki chintaa he
 There should also be someone who works with you
 lekin koi ek shaks nahin mila jo kahe ki mazaduron kaa bhi insaaf hona chaiye
 Amidst these hopeless things, i have high expectations from my super stars
 mere super star wo 25 log hai jo nahin badale
 The testimony of poor Kalim and eyewitnesses could not be changed

 reel life ke super hero par ye real life ke dabang kai guna baari pade
 Rain was talking to the bar's duty manager Rizwan, then asked if the statement remained the same
 His answer was just one line - told what he saw
 rigwaan us raat kaa gavaah he ki kaise haadase ke pehle salmaan ne sharaab pi thi
 There are 24 more witnesses like Rizwan who did not change
 wo har maukey par salmaan kii daleelon ko katate rahe
 The comments noummid to us police ne bhi nahin kiya jo der se sahi kuch karti hui dikhi
 All documents of that night are also with me the night Salman had crushed a man drunk
 sabko itmeenaan se dekha he
 The policemen who reached the spot have done everything by patting them
 police ne us raat shiddat se salmaan ko talasha tha, iske kaagazi saboot bhi hai
 If Salman had not met that night, it would not have been proved that he had drunk alcohol
 police ne koshish kii tabhi to pataa chalaa ki wo kis baar main gayi the kya piya tha
 It was the police who collected the evidence, so did not leave the bill which Salman and his colleagues had paid in the rain bar
 in noummidiyon or ummidiyon ke bich jhulate huye 12 saal main sab kuch badal gaya he
 The courts have changed, the police have retired, the witnesses have gone to their respective homes, only those who have slept on the sidewalk have not changed
 is shahar main ab bhi logon ke sone kii jagah nahin he

 Not even the police, who were late, seemed to be doing something right
 salmaan ne jis raat ek shaks ko sharaab ke nashe main kuchlaa tha us raat ke saare dastavej ab mere paas bhi hai
 Have seen everyone leisurely
 maukey par pahunche police waalon ne har kaam thok bajaakar kiya he
 There was also paper evidence that Salman was searched by the police that night
 agar salmaan us raat na milte to sabit hi naa ho paata ki unhone sharaab pi he
 When the police tried, it was found out what time they had gone and what they had drunk
 ye police hi thi jisane saboot jutaaye to us bill ko bhi nahin choda jo salmaan or uske saathiyon ne rain baar main chukaaya tha
 In the 12 years of swinging between these nominees and candidates, everything has changed
 adaalatein badal gayi, police vaale ritair ho gayi, gavaah apane apane ghar chale gayi, sirf nahin badla he to footpath par sone vaale
 There is still no place for people to sleep in this city
 barsaat main railway stesan par sahaara miltaa he or baaki ke mausam main footpath par
 In fact, despair occurs only when after the death of the laborer, he or she is put to life in the fight for justice but no one is ready to give them a roof while they are alive

 gurugram ke reyaan skool main hue murder cese kii jaanch kar rahi sibiai ne aaj police dwaara giraftaar kiye gaye bas conductor ashok kumaar ko clin chit nahin diya
 The CBI says that many reports related to this case are yet to come
 jaanch puri hone ke baad hi is sibiai is par koi faisla legi
 Hence the CBI opposed Ashok's bail
 jaankaree ke mutabik, yadi 90 dinon tak sibiai ne is maamle main chargeshit daakhil nahin kiya, to aaropee jamaanat ke liye adaalat ke paas ja saktaa he
 In such a case, the court can release him on bail
 darasal ashok kumaar ke vakil ne court main jamaanat arji daakhil kii thi
 The matter has been heard in the court today
 in binduon ke aadhaar par maangi thi jamaanat- aaropee ashok kumaar nirdosh he
 He has been wrongly implicated in the case
 - jaanch ke baad se ashok nyaayik hiraasat main he
 The offenses which he did not commit are also imposed
 - aaropee bas conductor se kisi tarah kii recovery yaa poochtacha kii jarurat nahin he
 - The second accused in this case has been caught
 aise main bas conductor kii hiraasat kii jarurat hi nahin
 - The accused is a permanent resident of Ghamroj village in Gurugram
 uske faraar hone kaa koi chance nahin he
 The CBI initially questioned accused Ashok Kumar on remand
 iske baad sibiai ne aaropee ko adaalat main pesh kiya tha
 The court sent him to jail
 phir sibiai ne is maamle main naaballig chaatr ko pakadaa or yah kaha ki usee ne pradyuman thakur kii skool ke andar hatya kii thi
 Due to the accused being a minor, the case is currently going on in the Juvenile Court of Gurgaon Sessions Court
 ashok ke vakil ne juvenil court main hi uski jamaanat arji daakhil kii he
 In such a situation, the court has no right to release accused Ashok on bail
 yah adhikaar sibiai court ke paas he, jo panchakula main he
 Let's say that on Wednesday, Pradyuman's father Varun Thakur reached the court against the accused
 vah chaahate hai ki aaropee naaballig chaatr ke saath balig jaisaa bartaav kiya janaa chahie
 In this regard, he has filed a petition in the JJ court
 isamen nae niyamon kaa hawala diya gaya he
 Earlier, Varun Thakur made a sensational reveal
 unhone kaha tha ki haryana sarkaar ke ek mantri ne un par dabaav banaaya tha ki vah is cese kii sibiai jaanch kii maang na karen
 He said that better than CBI, Haryana Police will investigate this case

 The selection committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has removed Alok Verma from the post of Director of Central Investigation Agency (CBI) to become Director General (DG) of Fire Services and Home Guards
 vahiin, nageshwar raav ko phir se sibiai kaa antarim pramukh banaaya gaya he
 The decision was taken at a meeting of the selection committee headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday
 is samiti main pradhanmantri narendra modi ke alaava supreme court ke varisht justise eke sikri or loksabhaa main vipaksh ke netaa mallikarjun khadge shaamil rahe
 The meeting took place at the residence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which lasted for more than two hours
 is baithak main mallikarjun khadge pradhanmantri narendra modi or justise sikri se asahmat najar aae or kuch aapattiyaan darj karai
 In spite of all this, the panel took a 2-1 decision and removed Alok Verma from the post of Director to become the Director General (DG) of Fire Services and Home Guards
 isse pehle mangalvaar ko supreme court ne alok verma ko sibiai nideshak ke pad par behaal kar diya tha
 He was forcibly sent on leave by the government about two months ago
 supreme court dwaara behaal kiye jane ke baad guuruuvaar ko piem modi kii adhyakshata main hui baithak main unako sibiai nideshak ke pad se hataakar fire services kaa faisla liya gaya
 Officials said that this is the second meeting of the committee on this issue
 isse pehle buudhvaar ko hui baithak benatija rahi thi
 Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana had accused each other of corruption, after which they were forcibly sent on leave
 buudhvaar ko alok verma dobaaraa sibiai nideshak kaa padbhaar sambhalate hi em nageshwar raav dwaara kiye gaye zyaadaatar tabadale radd kar die the
 Nageswara Rao was appointed as the interim CBI chief in the absence of Alok Verma
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki alok verma ne jin adhikariyon ke tabadale ke aadesh radd kiye, unhen verma kaa vishwaasapaatr mana jaataa he
 As per rules, this committee headed by the Prime Minister consists of a Chief Justice or a Justice of the Supreme Court and a Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha
 adhikariyon ne bataaya ki chif justise ranjan gogoi dwaara namit supreme court ke varisht ke nyaayadhish eke sikri or loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne buudhvaar ko hui baithak main hissaa liya tha
 Kharge has asked for documents, including the investigation report of the Central Vigilance Commission in the case
 khadge ne kaha, ‘maine sivisi kii jaanch reporton samet maamle ke sambandh main sarkaar se kuch dastavej maange hai
 Chief Justice Gogoi was part of the bench that ordered Verma to be reinstated to the post of CBI director on Tuesday, so he decided to keep himself away from the panel meeting
 philhal loksabhaa main koi vipaksh kaa netaa nahin he, kyonki kisi bhi vipakshi dal ko kul sadasyon kii 10 pratishat siten nahin mili thi
 Mallikarjun Kharge is the leader of the Congress, the largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha
 sheersh adaalat ne sarkaar se apane faisle ke ek hafte ke andar hi baithak bulaane ko kaha tha

 From May of this year till now, the RJD chief has traveled over 2,000 km in Bihar and traveled to more than a dozen districts and addressed as many public meetings in which the number of people has been very good
 rajnatik paridrishy par lalu kaa yah nayaa ubhaar he
 It is worth mentioning that former railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav was crushed in his shell after losing badly in the November 2010 assembly elections
 us chunaav main unki patni rabari devi donon siton par haar gai thim or 243 sadasyon vaali bihar vidhansabha main argedy kii takat 54 se ghatakar 22 rah gai thi
 After this election defeat, Lalu admitted that the people of Bihar had rejected him and he had no reason to go among the people
 unki hataasha is kadar bad gai thi ki july, 2011 main apni party kii saalagirah ke jalse main bhi ve shaamil nahin hue
 During this time, he went to Nalanda, Farbisganj in Araria district and Nitish Kumar's home district, to meet the victims of police firing and violence only once in September 2011
 ye donon daure bhi aupchaarik banakar rah gaye or ek baar phir lalu bihar ke rajnatik akhaade se gaayab ho gaye
 He was again seen among the people during the by-election held in November 2011 on the vacant Lokaha assembly seat vacated after the death of JD-U minister Hari Prasad Sah
 is upachunaav main bhale argedy kii haar hui, lekin party ke voton main 10,000 kaa ijapha hua, jisase lagane laga ki bihar main mukhya vipakshi dal ke taur par ek baar phir lalu kii pakad majboot hoti ja rahi he
 This increase in votes proved to be a ray of light for Lalu at the other end of the political tunnel
 thik chah maah baad lalu ne aurangabad main pulisia daman ke khilaaf ek baari jansabha ko sambodhit kiya, jahaan ek mukhiya devendra singh kushvaha kii hatya ke virodh main pradarshan kar rahe logon ko peeta gaya
 The manner in which Lalu has shaped his tour and his speeches, it seems that he has strategized very cautiously to regain his lost support base
 july main darbhanga daure par unhone muslim yuvakon kii giraftaar ke khilaaf mukhyamantri nitish kumaar par nishaanaa saadhaa jabaki pashchimi champaran se gaya tak july ke duusare saptaah main apane paanch din ke daure par unhone donon jagahon par kendriya vishvavidhyalayon ke liye prachaar kaa kaam kiya
 It was not even a month that the central government approved the creation of a central university at both places in the race for credit
 pichley pakhwaade ve nalanda or gopalganj kaa daura kar aae hai
 He completed these trips by motorcycle and boat
 lalu ne ateet se sabak lete hue khokhli muhaavarebaaji kii apni puraani aadat chhod di he
 Instead, they are trying to establish themselves as anti-government faces and cash in on the dissatisfaction prevailing among the people who are disillusioned with the hollowness of Nitish Kumar's claims and promises
 lalu ne apane prachaar abhiyaan ke liye sahi vakt chunaa he
 The next Lok Sabha election has been reduced to less than two years and relations between the JD-U and BJP, the constituents of the coalition government in Bihar, have also deteriorated
 lalu kii party ke logon ko bhi lagane laga he ki ab kaaphi sansaadhan or urja ikattha ho chuki he jiskaa istemaal bihar main siyaasi pani ko naapane ke liye kiya janaa chahie
 Despite this, many problems are also associated with Lalu
 kai saal satta se baahar rahane ke baad lalu ke liye yah sab utana aasaan nahin rahaa kyonki nitish ne lalu ke saamaajik aadhaar ko is dauraan kaaphi chot pahunchaai he
 Apart from this, the credibility that Lalu should have to capitalize on the anti-incumbency is not there
 isse bhi bura yah hua he ki lalu kii sehat ab jawaab de rahi he or unke virdohi dushprachaar karne main jute hai ki ve sakriy saarvajanik jivan kaa boj apane kandhon par uthaa paane main ab sakasham nahin honge
 It should be noted that in March 2012, Lalu was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi due to illness
 unke saath ek or badi dikkat yah he ki party main unke baad koi bharosemand netritv maujuud nahin he
 The way Mulayam Singh Yadav prepared his son Akhilesh Yadav to take charge after him, Lalu is believed to have made up his mind to shine his son 22-year-old Tejashwi Yadav
 philhal is yojana ko unhone jaan-bujhkar taal diya he taaki party ke varisht netaaon ko koi thes na pahunche
 Some leaders are upset with this preparation
 tejasvi ne 2010 ke vidhansabha chunaav main apni maa ke prachaar abhiyaan main bad-chadhakar hissaa liya tha, lekin ab tak unhone mukhyadhara main aane kii utsukata nahin jataai he
 Lalu has been successful to a great extent in repairing his party's nails
 party ke do asantusht saansadon-jagadanand singh or raghuvansh prasad singh-ne bihar kii endie sarkaar ke khilaaf abhiyaan main hissaa lenaa shuru kar diya he
 The party has a total of four Lok Sabha mps including Lalu, out of which three mps were staying away from party activities due to internal differences
 chauthe saansad umashankar singh kii shikaayat lagata he abhi dur nahin hui he
 On the other hand, after the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections were wiped out, the cold, Congress has now started strengthening Lalu's hands
 congress ke ek varisht netaa kehete hai, ''2009 or 2010 ke chunaavon main kamjor pradarshan ke baavjood bihar main endie ke khilaaf lalu hi sabase badi takat hai
 Our immediate goal is to win more mps in the 2014 elections and we cannot do this without taking regional parties together
 '' maujuuda loksabhaa main bihar se congress ke sirf do saansad hai
 Lalu's hope rests on one more thing
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav main kharaab pradarshan ke baavjood argedy ko 54,66,693 vot mili the jo kul pade voton kaa kareeb 19 fisadi he
 RJD leaders believe that Ramvilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party, using the party's base, which 6
 75 fisadi vot jatke, unhen waapas paaya ja saktaa he
 It is believed that rjd's traditional vote bank, ie Yadav, which constitutes 15 percent of the state's total population, stands firmly behind Lalu

 mumbai ke jis balaatkaari tantric ko police ne giraftaar kiya he, uske paap kaa koi ant nahin dikhaai padataa
 As police move forward, new revelations are happening
 police kii maane to tantric arabi kaa shikshak tha
 He came to Mumbai in 1999
 jin 6 ladakiyon se isane balaatkaar kiya he unhen bhi yah arabi padhaata tha
 He was taught Arabic language 6 days a month and raped her for two days
 jab is tantric ne un ladakiyon se balaatkaar kiya, us vakt sabhi ladkiyaan naaballig thim
 Police have said that he had been raping girls for four years
 inamen se do ladakiyon kaa aborshan bhi karavaaya tha
 Now the police will also arrest the doctor who abortioned these girls
 javed khaadim ke gunahon kii fehrist lambii hoti ja rahi he
 It is difficult to guess the extent to which the illusion of this great giant had spread
 dhire-dhire ek ek-kar iske gunahon kii paraten khul rahi hai
 Javed is finding out all his secrets and locations in front of the police
 police ne kalyaan main iske ek flats par chapa maaraa he
 In this raid, cash and jewelry worth Rs one crore have been recovered so far
 tantric kii hadpi hui sampatti kii ginati abhi jari he
 Police say that this seizure was caused by only one of its hideouts
 tantric ke or bhi khajaane khangale jane abhi baaki hai
 According to the police, he also has houses in South Mumbai, Thane and Central Mumbai
 is dhongi tantric ne police ko jo baaten poochtacha main bataai hai, uske mutabik usne ye saare paise or gahane, kaala jaadu kaa dhong rach kar kamaaya tha
 The tantrik was arrested on Sunday
 ise hawalat tak unalogon ne pahunchaaya jo iske sabase maasoom shikaar the
 This tantric had made 6 daughters of the same family, one by one, a victim of his lust
 inamen se teen naaballig thim
 How disgusting it is, it can be gauged from the fact that one of the girls who made her a victim of her lust was just 12 years old
 pehle is tantric ne ek ladki kii maa ko jhaanse main liya
 tantra-mantra claimed to have overcome her difficulties and then gradually took the woman's two other sisters in a bluff and raped her daughters
 in sabhi mahilaon ko bete kii chahat thi or tantric ne unki isi chahat ko bhunaate hue unki betiyon se itnaa ghinauna khel khelaa
 The police believe that the way goods and property are being recovered from its house, it is suspected that it has trapped many more families in its net
 unhen ummid he ki dhire-dhire is tantric kii shikaar hui or bhi mahilaayein saamne aa sakati hai
 That is, there are still more revelations about the black world of this tantric

 pradhanmantri manmohan sinhane loksabhaa main doharaaya ki 2008 main vishwaas mat hasil karne ke dauraan congress yaa sarkaar ke kisi bhi vyakti ne koi gaiyr kanoonee rasta nahin apanaaya tha or na hi unki sarkaar ne aisa karne ke liye kisi ko adhikrut kiya tha
 Responding to the discussion under Rule-193 on the demand of the opposition on the alleged misrepresentation made by the Prime Minister on March 18 in the House about the issue of note in lieu of vote in Lok Sabha, Singh said, "congress or Mary in adopting illegal means No government person was involved nor did i authorize anyone to do so
 ’samiti ke nishkarshon’ ke bare main kathith galatabayani ke aaropon ko sire se khaarij karte hue unhone kaha ki is maamle kii jaanch karne vaali sansadeey samiti kii report ko rakhte hue tatkaaleen loksabhaa adhyaksh somnath chatarji ne kaha tha ki report se yah katai sabit nahin hota ki loksabhaa main dhan ke bag lekar aane vaale saansadon ko jin kathith vyaktiyon kii ore se dhan diye jane kii baat kahi gayi thi, darasal unheen ne vah dhan muhaiyaa karaayaa tha
 'I have said what Somnath said at that time
 ’aam taur par mridubhashi singh ne kade tevar apanaate hue kaha ki vah apane raajnneetik jivan main vitt mantri ke samay se hi vipakshi hamale kaa nishaanaa banate rahe hai
 He targeted senior BJP leader LK Advani who was present in the House and said, "advani ji believed that becoming Prime Minister was his birthright
" unhone mujhe is baat ke liye kabhi maaf nahin kiya ki main pradhanmantri hum
 Later, Singh made the same statement in Rajya Sabha
 satta paksh kii mejon kii thapthapaahat ke bich unhone chutki lete hue kaha, ‘adwani ji swatantra or nishpaksh rup se hue chunaavon main desh kii janata ne hamen janadesh diya he
 Now you wait three and a half years
 ’ charchaa ke dauraan vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj dwaara ek sher ke jariye un par kiye gayi hamale par unhone sher ke jariye hi palatwaar kiya
 Sushma had said in the morning, 'you do not talk here and there, tell me why the caravan was looted, i do not get lost from the people (robbers), you have a question of Rahbari (leadership)
 ’ singh ne javaabi sher padhaa, ‘mana ke teri did ke kaabil nahin hum main, tu meraa shauk to dekh meraa intjaar to dekh
 On this, the ruling party applauded the Prime Minister by tapping the tables for a long time, while the Opposition remained silent
 pradhanmantri ne somnath ke hawaale se kaha ki samiti kii report main kaha gaya ki dhan ke bag lekar sadan main aane vaale teen saansadon kii bhoomika kii jaanch karne kii jarurat he
 The committee had also said that three persons, including Sudhindra Kulkarni, who are involved in the case, should be further investigated by a competent agency
 singh ne kaha ki maamla dilli police ke hawaale kiya gaya or abhi aage jaanch jari he
 'now the House should decide whether any such thing has been said anywhere in the report, the kind of baseless allegations that the opposition members are making
 ’ unhone doharaaya ki kisi desh ke bharat sthit duutavas or us desh ke prashasan ke bich hui baatcheet kii vishaywastu kii pramanikta kii pushti karnaa bharat sarkaar ke liye sambhav nahin he
 We cannot even investigate the conversation between a sovereign country and its embassy
 kaale dhan ke mudde par loksabhaa main bahes ke dauraan bijepi ke varisht netaa laalkrishna adwani ne sarkaar se kaala dhan waapas laae jane kii apil kii
 On this issue, the adjournment motion of the BJP was approved in the Lok Sabha
 adwani ne kaha, 'bina likhit anumati ke videshi bainkon main khaataa kholana bhi kanoonee aparaadh he
 He said that the government should tell what was done to bring back black money and what were the consequences
 adwani ne sarkaar se yah bhi poocha ki kaale dhan par kai notice bheje gaye, centre ne doshiyon par kya karrwai kii
 Launching the discussion on black money in the Lok Sabha under the adjournment motion, Advani told the government that instead of giving patronage to the names of Indian people holding black money abroad, he should immediately put the entire list of them in front of the country 
 unhone kaha, ‘sarkaar kaala dhan rakhane waalon kii puri kii puri suchi jari kare
 No name should be hidden
 videshon main kaala dhan rakhane vaale kisi vyakti kaa bachaav na karen or agar hamaara bhi naam ho to use bataaen
 He said that it is beyond his understanding that when the government has come to know the names of more than 600 people who have black money abroad, then why is he hesitating to tell them to the country
 pradhanmantri manmohan singh or vitt mantri pranab mukherjee kii upasthiti main videshon main kaala dhan rakhane vaale bhartiya logon se keval kar lekar unhen chhod dene ke prati aagaah karte hue bhaajapa ke varisht netaa ne kaha, ‘videshon main kaala dhan rakhane vaale bhartiya logon se keval kar lekar baat khatm nahin kar deni chahie balki aise logon ko dandit kiya janaa chahie
 Seeking to issue a white paper on black money, Advani said that it should also mention what efforts the government has made so far to bring back the black money of Indians stashed abroad
 adwani ne kaha ki bhaajapa ke sabhi saansadon ne 9 disambar ko bhrashtachar virdohi diwas ke avasar par sansad main apane sambandhit sadanon main yah halafanama de diya he ki videshon main unka koi avaidh khaataa yaa sampatti nahin he
 He asked the government to enact a rule under which it is necessary for all mps to give an affidavit in their respective houses that they do not have any illegal account or property abroad
 15veen loksabhaa main pehle kaarysthgan prastaav ke tahat apni baat rakhte hue adwani ne rajg shashan ke dauraan videshon se kaala dhan waapas laaye jane ke prayaas nahin karne ke aaropon ke sandarbh main daleel di, ‘kaha jaataa he ki jab ham shashan main the to hamane kyon nahin kiya
 This situation was not there earlier
 ’satta paksh ke sadasyon ke tahaakon ke bich unhone kaha ki sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad ke bhrashtachar ke viruddh samjhaute ke baad halaat badale hai
 He said that after the terrorist attack on America, France, Britain and Germany etc
 including him started pressurizing the banks having black money and due to this the names started to be exposed
 jis vakt adwani kaale dhan par apni baat rakh rahe the us samay sadan main congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi or mahasachiv rahul gandhi upasthit nahin the

 Yogi Adityanath described the Muslim League as a virus and said that a virus with which someone got infected could not survive and today the main opposition Congress has been infected by it
 sochiye agar ye jeet gaye to kya hoga? ye virus puure desh me fail jayega
 Explain that the Congress has an alliance with the Muslim League in Kerala
 yogi adityanath isi ko lekar congress or rahul gandhi par hamalavar hai
 Yogi Adityanath said that the whole country fought against the British along with Mangal Pandey in the freedom struggle of 1857, then this Muslim League virus came and spread that the whole country was divided
 aaj phir vahi khatra mandara rahaa
 The green flag wavered again
 congress muslim lig virus se sankramit he, saavdhaan rahiye
 The Muslim League is a virus
 ek aisa virus jisase koi sankramit ho gaya to wo batch nahin saktaa or aaj to mukhya vipakshi dal congress hi isse sankramit ho chukaa he
 Think what will happen if they win? This virus will spread throughout the country
 — Chowkidar Yogi Adityanath (@myogiadityanath)april 5, 2019bataa den ki isse pehle guuruuvaar ko bhi yogi adityanath ne congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi par hamalaa bolaa tha

 Secular if they contest elections after compromising with Muslim League? Communal even if we do 'sabka Saath Sabka Vikas'? He further said that unfortunate partition of the country happened due to Congress
 iske liye muslim lig va congress kaa gathjod jimmedaar tha, aaj rahul gandhi ne vynad se namakan kiya he or vahaan bhi congress kaa muslim lig se gathbandhan he
 This is a matter of grave concern for the country
 congress desh ke liye khatra banati ja rahi he
 BJP is a constant attacker, let us know that ever since Rahul Gandhi has decided to contest from Wayanad, the Congress has come under the bjp's target ever since

 The BJP Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party are all claiming their victory, but the reality is that the by-election is a challenge for the Aam Aadmi Party after a strong majority of 67 seats in the assembly elections, then there is a fight for survival for the Congress And the opposition party BJP feels that the government's rude attitude towards corporations will give it a clean sweep

 The party has made this election more important by putting them in MCD elections
 bijepi centre kii uplabdhiyon ke bharose to he saath main aam aadmi party kii dedh saal ke kaamkaaj kaa lekhajokha he
 The BJP claims that this election is a litmus test of the failures of the Aam Aadmi Party
 nagar nigam kii 13 siton par upachunaav bhale hi dekhne main chota lag rahaa he, lekin jis tarah se ye muqabla ho rahaa he, wo khaasaa dilachasp he
 Congress is searching for its lost land
 kyonki saal 2013 main dilli vidhansabha chunaav main congress ko 70 main sirf 8 siten mili to 2015 ke chunaav main party kaa khaataa tak na khul sakaa
 Now the Congress feels that the public has seen the functioning of the Aam Aadmi Party for one and a half years, in such a situation, the attitude of the people will now be on its side

 The party believes that it has won 67 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly elections
 ab dedh saal kaa uskaa shashan he jise janata dhyaan main rakhkar vot karegi
 Although this by-election is not so important according to the three MCD and 272 seats, but given the way the colors of the election are seen, it is definitely beginning to determine the direction and direction of the politics of Delhi

 congress apni khoyi jameen talash rahi he
 Because the Congress got only 8 seats in 70 in the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections, the party's account could not be opened even in the 2015 elections
 ab congress ko lag rahaa he ki aam aadmi party ke dedh saal ke kaamkaaj ko janata dekh chuki he aise main janata kaa rukh ab uski taraf hoga

 Which gave them full opportunity in preparation

 Now he has a rule of one and a half years which the people will vote after taking into consideration
 vaise to teen emsidi or 272 siton ke hisaab se ye upachunaav itnaa mahatvapurn nahin he lekin jis tarah se chunaav ke rang najar aa rahe hai use dekhte hue ye jarur lagane laga he ki ye chunaav dilli kii raajnneeti kii dasha or disha tay karne ke lihaaj se khaasaa ahm he
 But what is the mood of the public in reality, it will be known only after the calculation on May 17

 We will activate social organizations working in the street through our activists against the seduction and deception of girls by a class

 Why did Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh abruptly cancel the program of joining the Working Committee? Did these big leaders want to avoid issues like alleged love jihad? After the by-election was announced suddenly, the national president Amit Shah became very busy with the work of the organization
 baadh or north-east kii samasya ke chalate rajnath singh kaarysmiti kii baithak main nahin aa sake
 Many party leaders are directly making offensive statements against the alleged Love Jihad? This is the personal opinion of those leaders who are being misrepresented

 party netaa shuruyaat se iskaa virodh kar rahe hai lekin ab unke virodh ko lav jehad ke khilaaf sangharsh bataaya ja rahaa he jo ki galat he
 Is the BJP exploring the possibility of polarization through this by raising issues like alleged love jihad before the by-elections? Incidents like seduction of girls, exploiting them by deception have increased due to the policy of appeasement of a section of the SP government of the state 
 dangon kaa bhi yahi kaaran he
 The government should clear its position in it

 Book: Geetraj's poetry Why is there no available collection of poetry with its thickness? While searching for something on the backs of trucks running on the highway, this bona fide question often came to my mind
 samakaleen 'trek-sahitya' par ek adad kitaab kii namaujuudagi mujhe hameshaa khala karti thi
 i wanted to avoid wandering highway-by-highway to get that original bliss
 shukriya ‘gitraj’ ki unhone apane shaayari-sangrah se meri is vyaktigat ichha ko jane-anjaane kuch had tak puri karne kaa nek kaam kar diya
 i am giving you this tasty shergion to taste it, do not invite more amazing students to Geetraj! However, some lions have the illusion that they may have made a serious effort to write ghazals on their behalf, which later turned into a miraculous literary piece with some divine inspiration
 lekin ab jo bhi he, mjedaar he
 Read it, teach it to friends and enjoy
 pathakon kii suvidha kaa dhyaan rakhte hue kitaab main yah vyavastha bhi kii gai he ki uske rasoswadan ke dauraan jehan par zyada jor na aae or aap sabhi indriyon kaa istemaal karte hue khulkar, khilakar or attahas karte hue hans saken
 No better 'stressbuster' book will be available for Rs 50
 log stress bhagane ke tareeke likhakar samajhaate hai, yah kitaab practical karke dikhaati he
 All that has to be done is to keep the book with you round the clock, and in between it most of the time is to kill the brothers, friends and colleagues sitting nearby
 yaad rakhen ki yah nishchal bhavukta main likhi gai kitaab he
 In many places, the specific use of words suggests that the poet has a soft heart
 ek udhaaharan dekhen,ui main lut gai pyaar main, ui main lut gai pyaar menhua nahin koi bhi meraa, is zaalim sansar menghar main bhi main buree bani, baahar bhi badnaam huisabhi taraf se mili rusavaai, pyaar kiya bekaar mempadhakar lagata he ki ‘rasinic’ mehphilon main padhe jane kaa sabase pehla haq inhen panktiyon kaa hi hoga
 Like the world-where 'wah-wah' and 'mukrar irshad' have to be part of these
 kya gaalib-valib kiya karte hai aap
 Keep them in your heart
 kabhi-kabhi pard liya kiijie
 But the real poets of friends are Guru Geetraj
 jin logon ko laughter therapy dhakosla lagati rahi hogi, unhen gitraj kii gajalon kii talab lag jaaegi or ise sunne ve baar-baar aapke paas aaenge
 The excellent combination of the concept of 'expectation and neglect' in love is seen in this lion, always keep on kissing and giving us something, even if you never know 'if', we would have wept with the dead body as soon as you see it
 It is found that the use of 'if' in the above lion has wreaked havoc
 aise hi kai saahasik prayog gitraj ne kiye hai, jinka rachanadharmee or srujanaatmak logon ko notice lenaa chahie
 This shayari will haunt the old lovers and those who find pleasure in pain
 yahaan marm dekhie,bataaya gaya yah ki aag lag gaipucha kahaan to haath seene par rakh diyaaya ki jab vah kehete hai,agar ijaajat de do, tum ko jam bana lunkab se pyaasa hum main apni pyaas buja lunpariyon ke kisse main bachapan main sunata thaaaj ek pari ko seene se main laga loongitaraj ne bhavi premika ke saundarya ke abhootpurv byore die hai
 There are also delicate acts on which he accuses him of making crazy
 kai aise udhaaharan he jahaan gitraj kaa vishisht hindi prem umad-umad kar dikhataa he
 He has been able to do the rare literature in Ghazals with the helplessness of Hindi words like 'profit', 'sentiment' and 'moment'
 aarazu unki tu kar naa ‘gitraj’sambhav nahin ho paata haath chand kaa anayanazar se unhone jo nazar ko mila diyaanand kii paraakaashtha ko maine paa liyaayounaki mehandi ne bada hi gazab dhayaunaki sundarataa or hamaari tamanna ko badhaayaaqabil-e-zikr yahaan yah bhi he ki ‘gitraj kii shaayari’ un chuninda kitabon main se ek he jisamen ‘jananath’ or ‘jam’ ke neeche bhi nuqta laga hua aapako dikh jayega
 This shows the poet's love for Urdu as well
 gitraj kii shaayari main samvednaa ke sookshm taron se khilwaad karne kaa madda he
 It can also bring pinkness to a tired face shaved by the heat and the burden of the office
 shaayari main jo sharaarat he, yaa ki jo maukaparasti he, uskaa pataa bhi gitraj jahaan-tahaan dete hai
 For example, when he says, he is wrapped up, he gets away from the lightning, because of this excuse or this lion, the people are seen saying, 'hake bake', the house burns or the heart takes advantage of the opportunity
 This book is purely 'ishqiya Shayari ' is
 lekin iske baavjood gitraj apni saamaajik jimmedaari kaa nirvahan nahin bhuule hai
 To curse the system, he has chosen very popular words
 vah likhte hai
 It is happening every day that the public is involved in rape, in this self-denying inflation, as well as the rise of 'mango' in politics, he also underlines the signs
 jalawaa yun saream dikhaaya na kijieam insaan, mayqash, mayaqe sabhi jaaenge bahakkyon padhebgar maheenon se hanse nahin hai
 The mind is filled with heat and humidity
 dost sab naukari ke silsile main vyast hai or gudgudane ke sadhano ke abhaav se jujh rahe hai, to jarur padhein
 This book can prove to be a doom in increasing the tone of the courts
 haa or ek baat, aapke jaanane waalon main se kisi ne auto kharida he yaa kisi kaa transport kaa vyavsaay he to unhen gift kar den
 Trucks also need to move beyond 'I do not write ink with blood'
 yah multi-purpaj shaayari he
 If you have time, understand deeply, reach to the heart and support the poet in his pain
 varanaa padhie or khin-khin karte hue aage bad jaaie
 Why not read if you have a very puritanical attitude towards poetry, then understand that you will not have the divine vision to get the offerings of Geetraj
 said effect bhi ho sakate hai
 It is possible that by reading their emotional lions, your BP will increase and Rukhsar Gulkand will become red
 haalanki aisa hua to bhi dosha aapkaa hi he
 Bade has written, entertain yourself honestly by reading
 unke likhe hue kaa yahi sammaan kaaphi hoga
 Because the same is written on the cover page of the book, 'fill your heart with joy, with Geetraj's poetry
 ' The 'gulabi Gang' also played an important role in raising the voice of a Dalit girl who was allegedly a victim of the lust of the ruling Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA Purushottam Naresh Dwivedi in Uttar Pradesh and laid the foundation of action against Dwivedi

 Sampat, the head of the Pink Gang, who has been fighting against injustice and atrocity for nearly a decade in Bundelkhand, said, “we got the first protest in Banda upon receiving the news that the girl was implicated in the theft case
 baad main vidhayak dwaara us ladki ko apni havas kaa shikaar banaae jane kii khabar milane par hamane use nyaay dilaane ke liye sangharsh chhedaa
 According to Sampat, the girl told him that Dwivedi had asked him to marry one of his servants in order to continue his misdeeds
 unhone bataaya ki jailer ne ladki ke parijan tathaa uske shubhachintakon ko usase milane kii ijaajat nahin di
 However, the MLA of the MLA was open to go to jail for threatening the girl
 sampat ne bataaya ki is samvedansheel mudde kii taraf media, rajanetaaon tathaa sthaneey nivaasiyon kaa dhyaan khinchne ke liye gulabi gang ne joardaar abhiyaan chalaaya
 He said that there was anger among the local people not only against Dwivedi but also against the government which was ignoring the call of an innocent and if the accused MLA was not arrested, a big problem could have arisen
 sampat ne aarope lagaaya ki dvivedi ke khilaaf chhedi gai muhim band karne ke liye unhen paanch lakh rupye or kshetra main anek vikaas kaary karwaane kaa laalach diya gaya tha
 Referring to Dwivedi's associates still walking freely, he said, "this fight is not over yet
" shahjadpur gaanv main ladki ke parijan khauf ke saaye tale ji rahe hai

 These were the accused, out of which 10 were sentenced to death by the Khagaria court
 2009 main hue pichhadi jati ke logon ke narsanhaar ke baad peediton ko ummid thi ki unhen nyaay milegaa or narsanhaar karne waalon ko kanoon sajaa degaa
 But all the accused were released due to lack of evidence
 narsanhaar par yah lagaataar paanchvaan aisa faisla he, jab aropiyon ko saboot ke abhaav main hoicourt ne bari kar diya
 The biggest question arises on the police of the state, who do not claim to conduct scientific research on every incident
 shuukravaar jab patna hoicourt ne khagadiya ke amausi narsanhaar ke aropiyon ko bari kiya, to chaunkna lajimi tha, kyonki pichley do saalon main yah paanchavaa faisla tha jab narsanhaar ke aropiyon ko upari adaalat ne saboot ke abhaav main bari kar diya
 After all, what happened to the government claim in which the government had announced to punish all the accused of the massacre
 peediton ke mutabik, hycourt se unhen nyaay nahin mila
 They will now go to the Supreme Court
 nitish kumaar bhi is faisle ke khilaaf najar aae
 Nitish said that the government will go to the Supreme Court against it
 siem ne kaha, 'hoicourt to sirf apil kii jagah hoti he
 When the trial court sentenced him, it meant there was enough evidence against him
 'yah koi pehla maamla nahin he, jab narsanhaaron ke faisle par sawaal uthe hon
 In the last two years, the High Court has decided on about half a dozen massacres

 Earlier in October, 26 accused of Bathe massacre were acquitted, where 58 Dalits were killed by Ranvir Sena people

 Naresh Dixit, Senior Advocate of Patna High Court, says, 'see, every case is closely heard in the High Court
 nichali adaalatein kai baar mahaj exiaar ke aadhaar par faisle detii hai, lekin hoicourt main to baariki se sabooton par sunwaayee hoti he
 No innocent can be punished

 If no one is guilty in such massacres, then who is the culprit for the death of these hundreds of people is a big question
