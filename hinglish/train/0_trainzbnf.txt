 The Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), which was implemented on October 16 this year, did not prove to be a panacea for farmers, as was expected
 june main pashchimi madhya pradesh ke kisaanon par police kii golibari ke baad ghoshit is yojana ke tahat (bhrashtachar ke aaropon or kharide gaye pyaaj ke stock ke baari nuksaan ke aaropon ke bich) rajya swayan bhandaaran ke liye kharidari nahin karegaa
 Instead, farmers will be paid the difference between the minimum support price (MSP) and the model (model) price of the eight crops covered under the scheme
 agar bikri mulya adarsh keemat se zyada hua, to kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mulya or vikray mulya ke antar kaa bhugtan kiya jayega
 However, a fortnight after the implementation of this scheme, it has become another cause of trouble
 panjikaran or avarodhon ke chalate yah kharid prakriya kisaanon ke liye behad chunauti banakar saamne ai he
 The businessmen then refused to transfer the payment online and are proposing checks to farmers at a later date, citing a government order refusing cash payments
 pehle se hi rajya bhar main kai mandiyon main andolan ho rahe hai
 At first glance, it seems that the businessmen had also done the factionalization to suppress the prices, especially in the case of Urad
 urad ke liye nunatam samarthan mulya 5,400 ru
 Per quintal, while it is priced at Rs 2,000-2,200
 prati quintal kii dar se kharida ja rahaa he
 The government initially showed courage
 pramukh sachiv (krishi ) rajesh rajura kehete hai ki urad ko chhodkar bhavantar yojana ke lagu hone se pehle keemten vahi thim, jo is yojana ke lagu hone ke baad hai
 We will examine the purchase closely to prevent factionalization
 kisaanon kii uttejnaa or gusse ko bhaanpate hue, khaskar kharif kii taiyaari or rabi kii buaai ke ativyast maheenon main sarkaar ne kisaanon ke gusse ko shant karne ke liye apana tarika apanaaya he
 Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, after returning from a visit to the US, immediately announced several measures to smooth things over
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki vyavsaayee kisaanon ko nakad 50,000 ru
 They are able to give and they will be able to pay the remaining amount through RTGS
 vyapaariyon ne shuru main buree tarah ronaa royaa (deree se bhugtan hameshaa laabhadaayak hota tha), phir turant hi raste par aa gaye
 The state government is also paying the transportation cost from the farm to the market
 mukhyamantri chouhan ne yah bhi kaha ki sabhi fasalon ke liye adarsh keemat kii ghoshnaa har maheene kii jaaegi
 The state government expects 56 lakh tonnes of agricultural products to be procured through Bhavantar Yojana, costing around Rs 3,600 crore
 hogi, jisamen centre or rajya baraabar yogadan denge
 How much this will help is to be seen
 lekin congress sthiti se naakhush nahin he
 Opposition leader Ajay Singh says, "the farmers are not enthusiastic about the scheme, as is evident from the registration number
" " madhya pradesh main kareeb 85 lakh kisaan hai, lekin ab tak maatr 19 lakh kisaanon ne is yojana ke liye panjikaran karaayaa he or ek raajnneetik samooh ke rup main unka mahatv kisi ke liye khatm nahin ho saktaa
 Moving towards the assembly elections, Chauhan finally needs another farmer movement

 Singh has promised to listen to the pilots' complaints unconditionally and appealed to them to return to work, saying this is the 'last chance' to reinstate the 'almost bankrupt' airline

 chunaav prachaar ke dauraan congress pratyaashee urmilahalanki, aankadon par najar daalen to urmila ke liye yah utana aasaan nahin mana ja rahaa he
 Because in 2014, bjp's Gopal Shetty badly defeated Congress's big face Sanjay Nirupam
 gopal shetty ko 6,64,004 vot mili the, jabaki tatkaaleen saansad hote hue bhi sanjay nirupam mahaj 2,17,422 vot hasil kar paae the
 But if we look at the figures of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, then political seniority was lost in front of stardom
 bijepi kaa garh rahi is seat par 2004 main congress ne mashhoor abhinayta govinda par daanv khelaa tha
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee was at the center and Shining India slogan was being raised everywhere
 duusari taraf govinda ke saamne jansangh or janata party se hote hue maharashtra vidhansabha kii raajnneeti main apana sikaa jamaane vaale bijepi ke diggaj netaa ram nike the
 Not only this, many times MP Ram Naik was a Union Minister in the then Vajpayee government
 lekin govinda kaa jaadu aisa chalaa ki ram nike kad unke saamne chota pad gaya
 Govinda got more than five and a half lakh votes, while Ram Naik could get only five and a half lakh votes
 is tarah govinda kii yah jeet puure desh main charchaa kaa vishay bani
 Another Bollywood star's victory in the 2004 election with Govinda before Sonia Gandhi made headlines when superstar Amitabh Bachchan defeated a big political face like Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna
 1984 main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri indira gandhi kii hatya ke baad amitabh ne upi kii elahabaad seat se yah aitihaasik jeet darj kii thi
 Apart from Amitabh, Bollywood celebrities like Hema Malini, Shatrughan Sinha, Rajesh Khanna, Vinod Khanna, Paresh Rawal and Kiran Kher have also defeated big leaders in the Lok Sabha elections
 lekin philhal dilachasp ladaai mumbai north seat par he
 The current circumstances of the Mumbai North seat are also similar since 2004
 centre main vaajapeyi kii jagah purna bahumat vaali modi sarkaar he or unki sarkaar ke kaamkaaj kaa bhi shining india kii tarah jamkar prachaar prasar kiya ja rahaa he
 In such a situation, whether it will be able to do Urmila like Govinda from Mumbai North seat, it will be interesting to see

 One such shocking incident has emerged in Rajasthan
 yahaan ek vivaahita kaa kusur sirf itnaa tha ki wo dahej main gaadi nahin laai thi, wo dahej main keemtee jevar nahin laai thi
 Did not even bring a lot of cash
 uske liye garib parivaar main janm lenaa hi uskaa sabase bada gunaah ban gaya
 What was then, instead of decorating with her vermilion, her husband had written on her forehead 'my father is a thief'
 dahej kii khatir aise hua sitamadard kii yah dastaan rajasthan ke alvar kii rahane vaali ek vivaahita kii he
 Actually, the victim's father had married his daughter to Jaggu, a resident of Rajgarh, Alwar, last year
 shaadi ko mahaj 6 maheene bhi nahin beete the ki sasuraal vaale peedita par dahej laane kaa dabaav banane lage
 He asked the victim to bring 51 thousand rupees from his maternal home
 maayke main dahej hota to peedita shaayad maa-baap se yah kehane kii koshish bhi karti
 But knowing everything, she started to suffer every oppression of her in-laws
 har baar atyaachaar kii dehlijen paar hone lagi
 It was written on the forehead, 'my father is a thief' when one day the husband punished him for not bringing dowry so that the soul of anyone would be shaken
 pati ne pehle to peedita ke saath jamkar marpet kii
 He then wrote on his wife's forehead 'my father is a thief'
 jab itane se bhi us jaalim pati kaa man nahin bharaa to usne peedita ke haathon or jaanghon par mashin se bhaddi-bhaddi gaaliyaan gudwa di
 Her thighs were crushed with a knife
 us bebas mahila par julm kii intehaa yaheen tham gai hoti to us par raham hota
 But the greedy in-laws of the dowry were determined to cross all limits to oppress the victim
 sharir par bhaddi gaaliyaan likhane ke baad uske haivaan sasur or jeth ne uske saath jabaran balaatkaar kar uski ruh ko taar-taar kar diya
 Suffered everything but did not give up Despite suffering so much, the victim did not give up on the circumstances
 kisi tarah vah un jaalimon ke changul se jaan bachaakar bhaagi or jaise-taise amer sthit apane ghar pahunchi
 On reaching home, he told his father about the tragedy of every crime he had with him
 beti par hue atyaachaar kii kahani sun pita ke pairon tale jameen khisak gai
 The father immediately informed the police of Alwar police station
 jiske baad alvar police ne unhen yah kahkar taal diya ki aaropee yaheen ke rahane vaale hai
 If the police catch them, the accused will be released soon
 behatar hoga ki vah log amer thane main unke khilaaf mukadmaa darj karavaaen
 After the special team formed to arrest the accused, the victim's family registered a case against the accused under the sections of rape and dowry harassment at the Women's Police Station in Jaipur North
 peedita par hue atyaachaar kii dastaan sun police adhikari bhi hairaan rah gaye
 The police immediately got the victim medical and reached Alwar in search of the accused
 police ke vahaan aane kii bhanak lagate hi sabhi aaropee faraar ho gaye
 At present, the police has formed a special team to raid the accused
 esechao abdul wahid ne bataaya ki police ko mili jaankaree ke mutabik, aropiyon ke dilli main chhipe hone kii baat saamne ai he
 a police team has left for Delhi to pressurize the accused
 parivaar ko ab insaaf kaa he intjarpeedita ne apni aapbeetee bataate hue kaha ki uske sasuraal waalon ne uske saath marpet kii
 He was raped by his father-in-law and brother-in-law
 uske sharir par kai jagahbhaddi-bhaddi gaalialikhawane ke baad vah log use gaanv main ghumvate the
 The villagers used to make fun of him, laugh at him
 peedita ke pita ne kaha, beti ke sharir par likhi gai gaaliyon ko unhone chooney or tejaab se to mitaa diya lekin beti ke dil par ukere gaye yah jakhm vah kabhi nahin mitaa paaenge
 He pleaded for justice to the police officers and said that strict action should be taken against those who have ruined his daughter's life
 baharhaal rajasthan main ek mahila par atyaachaar kaa yah dil dahala dene vaala maamla tab saamne aayaa he, jab rajya kii mukhiya khud ek mahila hai

 pakistan ke khilayevishwa kapasemifinal menshandaar jitake baad ek arab se zyada bharatvasiyon ke armaanon ke phir sarathi banemahendra singh dhonimen aisa kya he, jo unhen duusare samakaleen captainon se alag karata he
 a recent study at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM-I) in Indore suggests that Team India's 'captain Cool' leadership is equipped with five 'corporate' skills, making them the ultimate in on-field and 'mind' games
 adhyayan ke mutabik inhen guron ke boote captain dhoni pakistan jaise dhur pratidwandvi ko dhul chataane main kaamyaab rahe
 Now his captaincy is to be measured once again in the World Cup final on April 2 against Sri Lanka at Mumbai's Kewanakhede Stadium
 baari dabaav or kashmakash se bhari bharat-paak bhidant kii prishthbhumi main dhoni ke naayakatv kaa adhyayan kiya im-ai main ranneetik prabandhan padhaane vaale professor prashanth salwan ne
 Salwan quoted his study as saying, 'dhoni's first tip is that he is a team player
 aapane kai baar dekha hoga ki kai baar unhone team ke hit main apni swaabhaavik style kii aakraamak ballebaaji nahin kii or sabko saath lekar chale
 According to the IIM-I study, Dhoni's tricks number two is that he is well aware of the strengths and shortcomings of his players and trusts them despite all the risks
 salwan ne kaha, ‘kisi corporate form ke adhyaksh kii tarah dhoni acchhee tarah jaanate hai ki team kii takat ko kab or kis tarah bhunaanaa he
 R
 in crucial semifinal against Pakistan
 aswin kii jagah ashish nehra ko aajamaane kaa jokhim bharaa, lekin aakhirkaarakamyaab faisladhoni ke isi gun kii gavaahi detaa he
 The third tip of the 29-year-old captain of the Indian cricket team is that he, like a mentor, gives players full opportunity to develop their talent
 isse khilaadiyon main aatmavishvaas or pararaspar vishwaas, donon panpate hai
 Salwan said, "it seemed that Dhoni managed to check the emotional tide that was pouring in Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Suresh Raina in the World Cup semi-final against Pakistan and they had to focus on their goals without being influenced by the external environment of the field
" Tended to concentrate
 ’dhonika chauthaa gur ginate hue im-ai kaa adhyayan bataata he ki vah maukey or maahaul ke mutabik ek aise khel kii ranneeti badalane main maahir hai, jo anischitata se bharaa he
 The study said, "in the World Cup semi-final match played by Pakistan, Dhoni changed the position of fielders and bowlers according to the situation

 100 fisadi online pement tabhi sambhav hai jab in workars ke paas bank acount honge

 Today, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the whole country is remembering him
 atal bihari vaajapeyi kaa janm (atal Bihari Vajpayee Jayanti) 25 disambar 1924 ko madhya pradesh ke gwalior main hua tha
 Former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a politician, poet, journalist, and sharp speaker
 raajnneeti main atal bihari (atal Bihari) vaajapeyi kaa pravesh 1942 main bharat chodo andolan main hissaa lene ke saath hua
 He and his elder brother Prem had to stay in jail for 23 days for participating in this movement
 aazaadee ke baad ve jansangh ke netaa bane
 Vajpayee contested his first election from Balrampur seat of Uttar Pradesh in 1957
 wo baad main party ke 1969 se lekar 1972 tak adhyaksh bhi rahe
 In 1997, he was also appointed Foreign Minister in Morarji Desai's government
 atal bihari vaajapeyi pehali baar desh ke pradhanmantri may 1996 main bane
 However, during this time his government came to a minority in just 13 days and he resigned from his post
 atal bihari vaajapeyi ko varsh 2015 main narendra modi kii sarkaar ne desh ke sarvocch sammaan bharat ratna ne nawaja
 Let us know 10 things related to the life of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee Quotes: 'there is no bigger than a small mind, there is no standing with a broken heart' PM Modi issued a 100 rupee coin in memory of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said- Can not believe he is not with us desh ke sabase bade aspataal main surakshakarmiyon kii gundgardee kaa maamla saamne aayaa he
 The security personnel have beaten the patient's family fiercely
 is marpet main peedit ko 17 taanke aae hai, jabaki marij kii maa kii anguli tut gai he
 When the victim's family requested the police to register a case, the police registered the case in very light sections
 jaankaree ke mutabik, ames ke aspataal or surakshakarmiyon ne marij ke parijaanon ko itnaa maaraa he ki unke 17 taanke lage the
 a video of Supervisor Chakravarthy accused in this case has also surfaced
 isamen chakravarti kah rahaa he ki esechao ne khud use is maamle se bachane kii salaah di thi or cross exiaar darj karwaane ke liye kaha tha
 Apart from this, the accused is also narrating how the police had changed the poles used in the fight to plastic pipes
 haalanki, peedit asagar ali or uske rishtedaaron ke dabaav ke baad police ne maamla darj kar liya he
 The victim's family says that the police did not take any action against Supervisor Chakraborty in this case
 iske alaava anya aaropee bhi hai jo ab tak faraar hai or unki jaldi giraftaar honi chahie
 What is the case: Asiba Ali's daughter Adiba Ali fell from the balcony on April 8 and her family immediately took the girl to AIIMS Trauma Center for treatment
 14 taarikh ko parivaar ke kuch log adiba se milanaa chaah rahe the
 During this time, the family had a fight with security personnel and bouncers
 baat itani bad gai ki surakshakarmiyon ko bounsar ne parivaar kii jamkar pitayee kar di
 Asgar Ali along with his wife Reshma and their relatives also suffered serious injuries in the incident
 is ghatana main peedit ajgar ali kaa haath tut gaya or chaati par bhi chotein ai hai
 Apart from this, 17 stitches of a relative of Ali have also come
 vahiin ajgar kii patni kii ungali tut gai he
 Lion rides will be fun, as long as the lion is down
 agar maamla aamane-saamne kaa ho yani jab sher or savaar donon hakeekat kaa saamana kar rahe hon, to phir maamla utana romantic nahin hoga
 Arvind Kejriwal, the supremo of the Aam Aadmi Party, may have realized this at this time
 haalanki supremeo kaha janaa kejariwal ko pasand nahin hoga, lekin aap party ke ghoshnaptr ke pehle panne par jis tarah unki or sirf unki tasviir lagi he, uske baad yah kehane kaa koi arth nahin rah jaataa ki aap party vyaktivaadee nahin he
 At least in this case, AAP has not started a separate political culture
 aap party nihsandeh ummiido kii party he
 But it is also a party of uncountable and almost impossible promises
 aap ke chunavi ghoshnaa–patr main vaadon kii aisi baraat sajaai gai he ki ab aap ke netaa shaayad us kaagaj ko dekhnaa bhi pasand na karen
 They also want to please traders and reduce inflation
 unke kuch vaadon ko dekhen, to andaja lag jayega ki har haath main bataasha rakhane kii kisi kavayad kejariwal ne kii he
 Look at some of his hundreds of promises: 1
 chaar maheene main bijli kaa rate aadha kiya jayega
 2
 dilli sarkaar kii naukariyon main essi, asti, obisi rigerveshan ko sahi tarah se lagu karnaa
 All backlogs will be filled
 3
 To create jobs for all contract employees including cleaning workers, drivers, teachers 4
 dalit udhyamiyon ko saste or jiro interest par lone dena5
 Forgive all illegitimate bills of water (it is not stated what is illegitimate)
 6
 Forgiving bills for families spending up to 700 liters of water 7
 dilli main do lakh public tailet bananaa
 8
 aspataalon main doctoron ke saare khaali padon (40 pratishat) par bhartee, nursing staff ke khaali post bhi bharna9
 10 opening at least 500 new schools
 musalamaanon ke khilaaf galat tareeke se mukadmaa karne waalon ko sajaa dena11
 Control of fees in private schools, prohibition of donation
 12
 To make government schools the same as standard private schools
 13
 14 to give 1 crore rupees to the families of those who died on the border or while fighting terrorism
 itani badi sankhya main court kholana ki har cese 6 maah main nipat jaae15
 Regularize all unauthorized colonies
 niyamit coloniyon ko milane vaali sari suvidhaayen dilaanaa
 16
 jhuggivaasiyon ko pakke makaan or plot dena or aisa hone tak unhen na ujaadnub kejariwal jab congress or bijepi ko samarthan ke liye patr likh rahe hai, to jaahir he ki kai bade mudde gaayab hai
 The fulfillment of an intangible promise like Swaraj can neither be measured, nor can it be complained of not fulfilling
 jabaki dilli kaa ek asthai safai karmchaaree puch saktaa he- aapke vaade kaa kya hua maharaj? kab karoge permanent? or ab to chaar maheene ho gaye
 When will the electricity rate be half that? Kejriwal may not have told all his voters properly that the backlog of reserved seats they are talking about to fill, if implemented, may be for many years that the General in Delhi Government There is no vacancy in the category
 yah samaj paanaa bhi mushkil he ki jo matadaata kejariwal ko siem or narendra modi ko piem dekhnaa chahta he, kya use is baat kaa andaja he ki kejariwal ne apane ghoshnaptr main musalamaanon ko lekar kya vaade kiye hai
 Kejriwal is standing on a slippery ground, where his real challenge is to stand upright, not running or walking

 In Karnataka, everything is not going well in the coalition government between Congress and Janata Dal (secular)
 rajya ke mukhyamantri echdi kumaraswami ke apni pidaa ujagar karne ke baad ab unke pita or desh ke purv pradhanmantri echdi devgauda ne bhi apana munh kholaa he
 JD (S) chief Deve Gowda has said that this alliance has only been six months and during this time he has seen everything
 devgauda ne kaha he ki vah ab tak to chup the, lekin ab unhen apana munh kholana pad rahaa he
 Not only this, the former Prime Minister of the country said that i am in pain
 aaj kumaraswami ko mukhyamantri bane chah maheene puure ho gaye
 We have seen everything in these six months
 maine ab tak apana munh nahin kholaa tha, lekin ab main chup nahin rah saktaa
 He further said that what is the way of running this alliance that you have to request your alliance partner daily that no one should make unparliamentary remarks
 bataa den ki isse pehle unke bete or rajya ke mukhiya echdi kumaraswami bhi congress vidhayak kii tippanee par bifer gaye the
 The Congress mlas had said that their CM is Siddaramaiah, who was the CM in the state earlier
 congress netaa or upmukhyamantri ji parameshwar ne bhi kaha tha ki siddharmaiya hi karnataka ke sarvshereshth mukhyamantri hai
 Angry at this, Kumaraswamy had said that he was ready to leave his post
 unhone kaha tha ki kanges ko apane vidhayakon kii jubaan par lagaam lagaani chahie
 After this case, the Congress also issued a show cause notice to the mlas who made such a statement, but it does not appear that the JD (S) is satisfied with it
 bataa den ki isse pehle karnataka main vidhayakon ke jodtod kii koshish bhi kii ja rahi thi
 Let me tell you that despite having 80 mlas in the state, the Congress is on the backseat and after winning 37 seats, Kumaraswamy of JD (S) became CM
 congress ne yah daanv 104 siten jeetne vaali bijepi ko satta main aane se rokane ke liye lagaaya tha

 ) NCLAT has ordered Cyrus Mistry to be reinstated as Chairman of Tata Sons
 Cyrus Mistry was removed from the post of Chairman of Tata Sons in October 2016
this is a big embarrassment for Ratan Tata who is in the final stages of his golden career
 Ratan Tata is believed to have played the main role in bringing out the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) again to replace Cyrus Mistry with Tata Sons Has been restored to Yrman post
 yah ratan tata ke liye ek badi sharmindagi kii baat he jo apane sunahare kariyar ke antim daur main hai
 This feud by Cyrus Mistry and Ratan Tata has been going on for the past several years and has its roots in many problems of Tata's business heritage
 oktober 2016 main tata sans ke board se sirus mistre ko baahar karaane main ratan tata kii hi mukhya bhoomika maani jaati he
 He inducted independent directors such as private equity investor Amit Chandra, industrialists Ajay Piramal and Venu Srinivasan on the board of Tata Sons and toppled Mistry in the boardroom coup
 mistre ko tata samooh kii sabhi companiyon ke nideshak pad se bhi baahar kar diya gaya
 Even after exiting the company, it is not acceptable that the Mistry family's Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) group had an 18 per cent stake in the Tata group, but they could not do anything because of being a minority shareholder
 unka muqabla tata trust jaise diggaj se tha jisaki tata sans main 66 fisadi hissedari thi
 Tata Sons is the holding company of the entire Tata group
 lekin company se baahar hone ke baad bhi sirus mistre post nahin hue
 He did not give up and he cleverly turned the fight into a Majority Shareholder versus a Monetary Shareholder battle and dragged the Tata Group to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)
 lekin unhen yahaan koi raahat nahin mili
 He suffered a loss here in July 2018
 iske baad vah isse bhi oonchi adaalat neshnal company lau apillet tribunel (NCLAT) kii sharan main gaye
 At every stage, Cyrus tried to show herself to the victim
 abhi khatm nahin hui he ladaibuudhvaar ko NCLAT ne na keval mistre ko phir se tata sans kaa chairman banane kaa aadesh diya, balki ratan tata or unke karibiyon ke khilaaf kai tippaniyan bhi kin
 This battle is not yet over completely
 sirus mistre 18 janvari tak chairman nahin ban paaenge, kyonki tab tak tata sans ko supreme court kaa sharan lene kaa adhikaar he, lekin baaki teen companiyon ke diarector banane ke aadesh ko tatkaal lagu karnaa hoga
 The battle between Cyrus Mistry and Tata is one of the worst battles in India's corporate boardroom
 isse kai tarah ke sawaal khadey hue hai jaise top akjicutives ko achaanak hataane ke pramotor ke adhikaar (sirus ke maamle main pehle to koi vajah nahin bataai gai or baad main non-parformens kaa aarope lagaaya gaya) or ritair hone ke baad bada kad hasil kar chuke agxcutives (jaise ratan tata) kaa group se phir se judane ke baad uske din-pratidin ke kaamkaaj main dakhal kaa kitna adhikaar he, iske alaava corporate gavarnence or minurity banaam memaurity shairdharak ke adhikaar se jude kai sawaal bhi khadey hue hai
 Now if the Tata group goes to the Supreme Court, these issues will be discussed again there
 is ladaai main kaaphi kuch daanv par laga he, kyonki aakhirkaar masalatata samooh par niyantranka he jisaki aay kareeb 7
 8 lakh crores, under which 29 listed companies come and 6 in its business spread over 160 countries
 60 lakh se zyada karmchaaree kaam karte hai
 Mistry's victory again reinforces his allegations that Tata Group companies are grappling with a number of legacy problems
 unhone kaha tha ki unhone company ke board or ratan tata ke saamne kai baar in masalon ko uthaaya tha or inase nipatane ke liye ek dhaancha banane kii bhi koshish kii thi
 Cyrus raised questions on these favorite projects of Ratan Tata, soon after he was removed from the Board of Data Sons, Mistry wrote a letter raising questions about the problems of Tata Steel and its Europe unit, Indian Hotels, Tata Capital and Tata Motors' Nano project Were
 mistre ne chetavanee di thi ki unhen viraasat main munafa na kama paane vaale ye jo paanch kaarobaar mili the, unase samooh ke bahikhaate main 18 arab dollar kii kami aa sakati he
 Mistry alleged that the Tata Group's overseas takeover has increased the debt volume significantly
 isi tarah euke or kenya main tata chemicals tathaa telecom kaarobaar bhi phiseddi sabit hua he
 Tata's Nano project, considered brain child, was also harming the company
 mistre ne yah aarope bhi lagaaya ki ratan tata ne unhen air asia or singapore airlines ke saath partnership main aviation kaarobaar main utarane ko majaboor kiya, jabaki isamen phaayde kii sambhaavna nahin dikh rahi thi
 What was said by Tata Sons? However, Tata Sons dismissed the allegations, saying that Mistry was fully aware of all these decisions and had been associated with Tata Sons since 2011 as a director
 tata sans ne kaha ki chaar saal tak pad par rahane ke baavjood mistre company aakhir khud un samasyaon ko kyon nahin dur kar paae jinka ve aarope lagaate rahe hai
 Now everyone's eyes are on this interesting battle
 kya vah is ladaai ko antim parinti tak le jaaenge yaa apni pratishtha waapas hasil kar lene ke baad ab kadavaahat ko dur karte hue company se dur ho jaaenge? haalanki pichley anubhav ko dekhte hue aisa lagata nahin ki mistre itani aasaani se yah ladaai chhodane vaale hai
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached Kashi on Thursday and took out a road show and performed Shakti
 is dauraan kaashi ne piem modi ke liye jamkar pyaar dikhaaya
 Kashi's love for her is unique, but not new
 baba vishwanath kii nagari ne hameshaa hi un par dil kholkar apana aashirwad or pyaar barsaaya he
 The streets of Kashi gathered up a huge crowd and the city of Baba Vishwanath became saffron
 jab pradhanmantri modi kaa road sho muslim bahul ilaake sonarpur se hokar guzar rahaa tha tabhi vahaan par ek bujurg aadmi ne piem modi ko shawl bhent karne kii koshish kii
 On this, PM Modi stopped his road show and took a shawl and covered it

 com / lzsasmwalx — Sachin Singh (@ sachinsingh1010) April 25, 2019 This roadshow took off from Banaras Hindu University to Dashashwamedh Ghat
 iske baad piem modi ne vahaan pahunchakar ganga aarti main hissaa liya
 After this, PM Modi addressed the public meeting
 unhone kaha ki samarth bharat ke liye, sampann bharat ke liye, sukhi bharat ke liye vikaas ke saath-saath suraksha jaruri he
 We are moving towards a direction where there is science, spirituality, talent, tourism, food and sports, modernity but without westernization
 piem modi kaa yah road sho sirf kaashi main apane vyaktitv kaa chamatkaar dikhaane ke liye nahin thi, balki purvanchal ke chunaav main chamatkaar rachane ke liye thi
 a miracle that is the necessary way to take BJP to power for the second time
 kaashi piem modi ke liye ek chunaav kshetra bhar nahin he, balki raajnneeti kii ek aisi prayogshaala he, jisase bijepi ke liye chamatkaarik parinaam nikle hai
 It was Modi's Banaras bet, which in the last Lok Sabha election, he won 104 of the 120 seats of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
 narendra modi acchhee tarah samajhate hai ki kurteke rang se bhi raajnneeti kaise badali jaati he
 They understand well how the idioms of religion are changed through the road show
 wo acchhee tarah samajhate hai ki ganga kii aarti se kaise gerua raajnneeti kii chaal badal deni he
 At a time when big leaders are weighing their confidence in their seats, Modi is extra confident
 banaras modi ke liye sirf shahar nahin he, balki unki siyasat kaa sabase bada sandesh he
 When Modi first came to Benares, no one had any idea that he would turn Kashi into a doom for his opponents
 mayawati ko andaja nahin tha ki modi unke pairon ke neeche se jameen tak khinch lenge or shunya par samet denge

 Former Pakistan batsman Rameez Raja had to question the 'A' grade contract given to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the former captain of the Indian cricket team, and the Indian cricket fans on social media heard him fiercely
 
 
 darasal, rameez raja ne antarrashtriya cricket parishad (isisi) se aagrah kiya he ki har saal main do maheene kaa vakt sirf test maichon ke liye tay kar diya janaa chahie, taaki khel ke is sabase lambe format ko bachaaya ja sake
 
 
 MCC World Cricket Committee member Rameez Raja says that even though countries like England still get crowded to watch Test matches, to some extent due to domestic T20 competitions like Indian Premier League (IPL), Asian People's interest in the test is decreasing in countries
 
 
 tippaniyan Rameez Raja also said that National Sports Regulatory bodies like the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have also played a role in this
 
 
 apni baat ko sahi sabit karne ke liye rameez raja ne bhartiya team ke purv captain mahendra singh dhoni ko bisisiai dwaara die gaye 'e' grad contract kaa bhi zikr kiya
 
 
 He said, "you have to respect the status of Test cricket, and accept it
 
 
 or yah cricket bordon kii ore se hona chahie, khaastaur se asia main
 
 
 For example, MS Dhoni has retired from Test cricket, yet he was awarded an 'A' grade contract by the BCCI
 
 
 isi tarah shahid aafridi test cricket se ritair ho chuke hai, phir bhi pisibi ne unhen 'e' grad contract diya
 
 
 " bhartiya cricket prashansak rameez raja ke is tark ko hazam nahin kar paae, or unka jamkar mazaaq udaane lage
 
 
 Some Indian fans advised Rameez to focus on the PCB, while some even questioned his commentator
 
 
 kuch ne unhen mahendra singh dhoni kii izzat karne kii naseehat di, or kuch ne kaha ki unhen saalon tak champions trophy main bhartiya team par pakistan ko mili jeet kaa jashn manaate rahanaa chahie

 Kindly mind your own Business and care about ur commentary fee - bigb (@ Nik_2109) July 5, 2017 @ iramizraja why you interfer in @BCCI grade contract? @msdhoni is legend in India
 He deserves a grade contract
 - Shah Raj (@ Raj0725_shah) July 5, 2017 rameez raja kaa kahana he ki asia main yah (test cricket) kaaphi dabaav main he, lekin agar salike se yojana banaakar test match championships yojit kii jaae, to sab kuch sahi ho saktaa he, varanaa zyaada se zyaada uplabdh paisa tii-20 ligon par hi kharch kiya jaataa rahegaa, jisase antat test cricket ko baari nuksaan hoga
 
 
 In fact, Rameez Raja has urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) that every year two months' time should be fixed only for Test matches, so that this longest format of the game can be saved
 
 
 emsisi world cricket cameti ke sadsy rameez raja kaa kahana he ki bhale hi england jaise deshon main aaj bhi test match dekhne ke liye bheed pahunch jaati he, lekin kuch had tak indian premier lig (ipel) jaisi gharelu tii-20 pratiyogitaaon kii vajah se asian deshon main test ke prati logon kii ruchi ghatati ja rahi he
 
 
 The comments rameez raja ne yah bhi kaha ki bhartiya cricket niyantran board (bisisiai) or pakistan cricket board (pisibi) jaisi rashtriya khel niamak sansthaaon kii bhi isamen bhoomika rahi he
 
 
 To justify his point, Rameez Raja also referred to the 'A' grade contract given by the BCCI to former Indian team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 
 
 unhone kaha, "aapako test cricket ke darje ko sammaan dena hoga, or use sweekaar karnaa hoga
 
 
 And it should be from the cricket boards, especially in Asia
 
 
 udhaaharan ke taur par, emes dhoni test cricket se ritair ho chuke hai, phir bhi bisisiai dwaara unhen 'e' grad contract diya gaya
 
 
 Similarly, Shahid Afridi has retired from Test cricket, yet the PCB gave him an 'A' grade contract
 
 
 " Indian cricket fans could not digest Rameez Raja's argument, and mocked him fiercely
 
 
 kuch bhartiya prashansakon ne rameez ko pisibi par dhyaan dene kii salaah di, jabaki kuch ne to unke camentator hone par bhi sawaal khadey kar die
 
 
 Some asked him to respect Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and some said that he should keep celebrating Pakistan's win over the Indian team in the Champions Trophy for years

 — Shah Raj (@raj0725_shah) July 5, 2017 Rameez Raja says that in Asia (test cricket) it is under a lot of pressure, but if a well-planned Test match championship is held, then everything can be right, otherwise more and more money available on T20 leagues Will continue to be spent, which will eventually cause a huge loss to Test cricket
 
 
 rameez raja ne yah bhi kaha ki bhartiya cricket niyantran board (bisisiai) or pakistan cricket board (pisibi) jaisi rashtriya khel niamak sansthaaon kii bhi isamen bhoomika rahi he
 
 
 In order to make his point right , Rameez Raja also referred to the 'A' grade contract given by the BCCI to former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni
 
 
 unhone kaha, "aapako test cricket ke darje ko sammaan dena hoga, or use sweekaar karnaa hoga
 
 
 And it should be from the cricket boards, especially in Asia
 
 
 udhaaharan ke taur par, emes dhoni test cricket se ritair ho chuke hai, phir bhi bisisiai dwaara unhen 'e' grad contract diya gaya
 
 
 Similarly, Shahid Afridi has retired from Test cricket, yet the PCB gave him an 'A' grade contract
 
 
 " Indian cricket fans could not digest Rameez Raja's argument, and mocked him fiercely
 
 
 kuch bhartiya prashansakon ne rameez ko pisibi par dhyaan dene kii salaah di, jabaki kuch ne to unke camentator hone par bhi sawaal khadey kar die
 
 
 Some asked him to respect Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and some said that he should keep celebrating Pakistan's win over the Indian team in the Champions Trophy for years

 The Indian cycling team, preparing for the Commonwealth Games, threatened to return crores of bicycles from England to the Sports Authority of India (SAI) in protest against a new condition of SAI
 darasal, sai ne rashtramandal khelon ke liye chuni gai team ke cycliston ko nai cycilen dene ke baad unase band bharne ke liye kaha
 It was written on this bond that if there is any damage to the bicycles or they are lost, then it will be the responsibility of the cyclists and they will be responsible for this
 iske baad cycliston ne band par hastakshar karne se manaa kar diya or cycilen lautaane kii dhamkee di thi lekin sai ne dabaav banaakar aakhirkaar in cycliston se is band par hastakshar kara liye hai
 Unhappy with Sai's attitude, a cyclist, on the condition of anonymity, said, "sai did not say when giving new cycles that bonds would have to be filled
" jab hamen ye pataa chalaa to hamane unase kaha ki hamen nai saicilen nahin chahie
 Though the Cyclists had to fill the bonds after the pressure was put on them by Sai, they are now upset because the cycle from England is worth millions
 cyclist ne kaha, ‘agar isamen :cycle: koi nuksaan hota he yaa ye kho jaati he to hamen iskaa bhugtana karnaa padegaa
 On this matter, Sai's Chief Cycling Coach Kiran Bala admitted that the bonds have been filled with the cyclists but he also said that this is a necessary process
 kiran ne kaha, ‘unase (cycliston) band bharvaya gaya he
 This is important because we want them to take care of their bicycles in the same way, and this happens every time
 ’unhone kaha ki cycliston ko ghabaraane kii jarurat nahin he kyonki sabhi cykilon kaa beemaa karvaa diya gaya he
 The Sai representative said, 'these bicycles are very expensive
 ham chaahate hai ki jitani acchhee sthiti main unhen cycilen di gai hai waisi sthiti main hi ve hamen waapas karen

 In politics, he is identified as the 'chirag' of Ram Vilas Paswan
 vaise chiraag ne ek alag pahchaan banane kii koshish kii thi
 As an actor in Bollywood, but he flopped

 He became an MP as soon as he entered politics
 chiraag paswan ke raajnneetik safar kii baat karne se pehle jaanate hai unki nijee jindagi ke bare main
 Chirag, son of Ram Vilas Paswan's second wife Reena Paswan, was born on 31 October 1982 in Khagaria, Bihar
 chiraag ne nai dilli ke neshnal institute of open schooling se 10veen or 12veen kii padhai kii
 He then went on to do btech in computer science from Bundelkhand University, but here he studied only till the third semester
 beatech kii padhai bich main chhodane ke baad chiraag paswan mumbai nikal gaye
 Here he wanted to make his career in films
 2011 main unki film ai 'mili na mili ham'
 In this film of Tanveer Khan, apart from Chirag, Kangana Ranaut, Neeru Bajwa, Sagarika Ghatge
 is film main chiraag kaa shweta tiwari ke saath ek item number bhi tha
 The film flopped badly at the box office
 iske saath hi chiraag paswan kaa bollywood kaa safar bhi tham gaya
 Returning from Bollywood, Chirag started working for his father Ram Vilas Paswan's party Lok Janshakti Party
 2014 kaa chunaav sir par tha
 Ram Vilas Paswan could not decide whether to go with the UPA or with the NDA
 kehete hai ki chiraag paswan ne endie kaa hissaa banane kii salaah di
 LJP contested 7 seats in Bihar after alliance with NDA
 khud chiraag jamui loksabhaa seat se lade
 LJP managed to win 6 seats

 aam chunaav kii tazaa khabaron se apadet rahane ke liesbscrib karenajatak kaa ellection special newzlator As soon as Delhi took power on December 28, 2013, the Kejriwal government of Delhi promised that the Jan Lokpal bill would be passed within 15 days
 haalanki vaada to puraa na ho sakaa lekin aaj dilli sarkaar janalokapal bill ko hari jhandi dikhaa sakati he
 There is a meeting of Kejriwal cabinet at around 11 am in the day and there is a possibility of getting the bill approved
 lokapal ko lekar kejariwal kii apni ore se koshish puri he lekin ajtak ke paas khaas jaankaree he ki janalokapal bill par dilli or centre sarkaar ke bich phir takaraav ke asaar hai
 The Law Department has suggested to the Delhi government that before the Lokpal Bill is introduced in the Legislative Assembly, it will be necessary to get the approval of the Center
 aise main cabinet kii hari jhandi ke baad bill uparajyapal ke paas jayega
 The Lt
 Governor will send it to the Ministry of Home Affairs for approval
 lekin, agar grih mantralay ne file roak lee to phir donon sarkaron ke bich takaraav ho saktaa he
 According to sources, Kejriwal's own 3 departments have more than two dozen objections to this bill and they have put a hurdle before the bill comes in the cabinet
 grih, kanoon or vitt jaise vibhaagon ne takreeban 20 aapattiyaan jataai hai
 The biggest objection is that when DDA and Delhi Police come under the Central Government, how can they be kept under the ambit of Delhi Lokpal Bill
 grih vibhaag kii taraf se to itnaa tak kaha gaya he ki jab lokapal ke paas adaalat ke adhikaar hai hi nahin to phir wo sazaa kaise de sakati he
 Obviously, it will not be easy for Kejriwal to fulfill the promise made to the public on the Jan Lokpal bill

 Have you ever wondered why America attacked Iraq and toppled Saddam Hussein, why he is bent on removing President Bashad al-assad from Syria, why he now has trouble with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un
 iskaa jawaab aap jameen ke upar talaashenge to aapako kuch nahin milegaa
 If you want to know the answer, search under the ground, because this whole game is being played under the ground
 upar jo hota dikh rahaa he, wo to bas dikhaava he
 We will show you the real game
 dekhie or samajhie kii duniya kii raajnneeti jaisi dikhti he, waisi hoti nahin
 Saddam's coup from Iraq
 syria se asad ko hataane kii koshish or abnorth koriamein kim se jang kii taiyaari
 Why does America struggle so much to enter into other countries and implement democracy
 kyon use duusare deshon kii janata kii phikr sataati he
 Is America really so sympathetic? haalanki bahut se aise desh hai jahaan log abhi bhi loktantr ke liye taras rahe hai
 America also has friendships with those countries
 to phir is meharbaani kii sachai kya he
 If you look from above the ground, it will look like America's Messiah
 magar log aisa ilzaam lagaate hai ki america ne jang zamin ke upar satta badalane ke liye balki zamin ke neeche chhipe khazaane liye ladi
 However, these are all allegations
 magar phir aaiye jaanate hai ki pehle iraq
 
 phir syria or ab north korea kii zameenon ke neeche aakhir aisa kya he
 
 jisaki vajah se america jaise desh par ye ilzaam lagane kii koshish ho rahi he
 Indeed, petrol for Iraq, gas for Syria and mineral material for North Korea are the backbone of their economy
 agar unase ye hi chin liya to unhen sadak par aate der nahin lagegi
 And those who achieve it will not take long to become rich
 syria or iraq se alag america ne philhal apni sari takat north korea ke taanashaah kim jong un kii nakel kasne main laga rakhi he
 The US alleges that Kim Jong is starving the people there for his craze and debauchery for those weapons
 haalanki north korea use sirf or sirf america propeganda bataata he
 At present, the situation has become such that North Korea is threatening to attack America and America on North Korea
 parmaanu jang kii ashanka vaale halaat ban chuke hai
 Not only this, the US has landed its battle fleet in Korean peninsula
 ek report ke mutabik sirf america yaa uske sahyogi hi nahin balki china jaise kai deshon kii nazar uttar korea kii jameen main khanij padaarthon ke rup main dafn sone par he
 Some want to get this gold by becoming friends and by grabbing something
 aapako bataa den ki ye aise inderground resources hai jinhen abhi chuaa bhi nahin gaya he
 And if the right technology is used to remove them, then North Korea will become so rich overnight that no one can even guess
 yahaan 200 se zyaada beshkeemtee khanij hai
 Now just listen to the estimated price of these 200 precious minerals
 agar inhen proper tareeke se nikaala jaae to inaki keemat hoti he kareeb 4,760 kharab rupye
 This amount is so much that if it is distributed, then every person living on this earth will get 67 thousand rupees
 jaankaar aarope lagaate hai ki north korea ke bare main duniya sirf utana hi jaanati he jitna america bataanaa chahta he
 This truth has always been hidden from the world that this is also a truth of North Korea
 jo raaton raat uski duniya badal sakati he
 Apparently, due to lack of money and technology, Kim Jong Un is unable to take out this gold buried on his own soil
 magar use apni is takat kaa ahsaas he
 North Korea is already facing considerable restrictions due to Kim Jong Un's love of arms
 or jang ke halaat main america kii pehali koshish yahi he ki wo north korea ke aarthik zariyon par nakel kase taaki ab aage wo or parmaanu yaa missile pareekshan na kar sake
 In the event of war, this dictator can be controlled
 vahiin duusari taraf ek report ke mutabik america khufia agency siie hamale ke bajaae kim jong un ko maravane kii saazish rach rahi he taaki taanashaah kaa khatra bhi na rahe or north korea main koi aisi sarkaar bane jo america hiton ke liye makul hon
 However, it cannot be said that America wants war with North Korea just to serve its interests
 balki uski koshish apane raashtra ko kim jong un ke parmaanu mixilon se surakshit karne kii bhi he
 US President Donald Trump has said that now if North Korea does any kind of nuclear or missile test, America will not hesitate to attack it
 magar kya america ke liye uttar korea par hamalaa karnaa itnaa aasaan hoga

 kehete hai ki insaani dimag se khatarnaak koi cheez he hi nahin
 You may have seen many stories of robbery, theft, robbery, deception and deception
 usee kadi main yah nai kahani dilli se ai he, par yah thodaa hatakar he
 Unlikely because the CBI, which is usually a thief, a thug, a crook, a criminal, tries to stay away from him, the opposite is true in this story
 yahaan chor hi sibiai afasar bane baithe the or kahani thik 'special 26' jaisi thi
 Outside the film screen, even in real life, three criminals were accomplishing a big feat with their companions
 bas inase galati yah ho gai ki chapa maarane kii raftaar main ye asli sibiai vaale se bhi kahin aage nikal gaye
 He was so blind in greed that he began raiding raids in Uttam Nagar area of delhi without thinking
 in chhaapon se log bhi ghabara gaye ki aakhir sibiai ko achaanak kya ho gaya he
 After this, the raids slowly started coming out and these things reached the ears of a truly CBI DSP
 phir kya tha, sibiai bhi ghabara gai or soch main pad gai ki aakhir koun-se ve tej-tarraar afasar hai, jo itane chaape maare ja rahe hai
 Now CBI takes help of Delhi Police to know the truth
 dilli police ko sibiai bataati he ki uske naam par shaayad koi or chaape markar logon ko lut rahaa he
 After this the Delhi Police investigates the case
 chaape ke shikaar logon se poochtacha karti he, tab asli kahani saamne aati he
 The story is that even in Dalli, on the lines of 'special 26' some vicious minds were looting people in the name of raid as CBEI officers
 uttam nagar police ko sibiai ke dspi se shikaayat mili
 After that, the three criminals were arrested
 unke paas se kaaphi sankhya main nakli card mili
 After this, the police reached the truth and on the other hand, all the goods of CBI were decorated on the table of a police station of Delhi Police
 ab tasviir kuch yun bani he ki jo dusron ko ab tak farji tareeke se giraftaar karne kii dhauns diya karte the, wo asaliyat main khud giraftaar ho chuke the
 At present, three have been caught, but three of them have duped so far in Delhi or raided in the name of CBI, how many they do not remember their own count
 pakade gaye teenon shaatir main se ek pichley paanch saalon se nakli certificate or ycard banane ke dhandhe main tha, jabaki doosraa computer kii digining main maahir he or teesraa planning main

 ek bijness news channel se baatcheet main shankaracharya bole ki modi mahaan gunon vaale vyakti hai or agle loksabhaa chunaavon main vah pradhanmantri pad ke liye puri tarah se yogya hai
 Shankaracharya also accused the Congress of spreading communalism while mixing the bjp's voice
 unhone kaha ki congress party secularism ke naam par musalamaanon or isaiyon ke vot batorna chaahati he
 Rahul's evil, but praises Indira, while Shankaracharya Saraswati pulled Rahul and Sonia, while praising Rahul's father Rajiv Gandhi and grandmother Indira Gandhi
 unhone in donon purv pradhanmantriyon kii asamay mrityu par khed jataayaa

 Different leaders have started reacting to the breakdown of SP-BSP alliance in UP
 upi sarkaar ke cabinet mantri suresh khanna ne kaha ki gathbandhan tuutane ke bare main chunaav se pehle hi kah diya tha
 State Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma said that it was already said that after elections, the doors of aunt will be closed forever for Akhilesh
 kuch aisi hi pratikriya kanoon mantri brijesh pathak or bijepi ke pradesh adhyaksh mahendra nath pandeya ne bhi di
 State Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma said that SP is saying that Dalits have gone, BSP is saying that Yadav has gone but the people of Uttar Pradesh have voted for BJP by breaking these casteists
 is gathbandhan ke bare main maine kaha tha ki 23 taarikh ke baad akhilesh ke liye buaa ke daravaaje band ho jaaenge
 Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that 'SP-BSP Lok Dal will fight even if we fight together, we will fight even if we fight separately
 jahaan tak mayawati kaa sawaal he to jo bijepi kii sagi nahin hui, jisane unhen 3 baar siem banaaya to vah akhilesh kii kya hongi? or akhilesh apane pita ke nahin hue to mayawati ke kya honge? yah to saanpnath or nagnath kii ladaai he, maine pehle hi kaha tha ki yah tuutane vaala he
 Mahendra Nath Pandey, former President of UP BJP and current Union Minister said that we had said many times that there is no policy behind this alliance but there is an alliance to come to power
 isliye iskaa aisa hi hashr hona tha lekin itnaa jaldi ho jayega ye aashcharya kii baat he
 He also said that the party staying away from the by-election is coming to the by-election to save its existence
 bijepi shandaar tareeke se chunaav ladegi
 This is their reform program, who will improve whom, who will spoil or who will repeat the deities of Nagnath Sampanath again, this will be seen by the people of Uttar Pradesh
 gathbandhan tuutane par swami prasad ne kaha ki 'hamen puri tareeke se yah abhas tha ki gathbandhan tuutegaa
 This was decided because it was a coalition based only on selfishness
 is gathbandhan kaa koi nunatam kaarykram nahin tha
 There was no political issue related to the public, coalition of interests is not sustainable by itself

 unhone spasht karte hue kaha "yah ek sthaayee viraam nahin he
 "he asked the Samajwadi Party to improve its cadre
 unhone kaha ki yadav matadaataaon ne gathbandhan kaa samarthan nahin kiya
 He said, "if the Yadavs had voted for the coalition in large numbers, then senior SP leaders like Dimple Yadav, Dharmendra Yadav and Akshay Yadav would not have lost from the majority seats
 yah samaajawaadee party ke liye chintaa kaa vishay he
 "the BSP president clarified that his party has not benefited from the Samajwadi Party's base vote
 mayawati ne kaha, "haalanki, ham raajnneetik majaburiyon ko nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate or ham vidhansabha upachunaav ladenge
 However, this is not the end of the way
 agar samaajawaadee party apane kaaryakartaaon main ek mishanri utsaah paidaa karti he or apane pradarshan main sudhaar karti he, to ham dekhenge
 "mayawati spoke about her relationship with Akhilesh Yadav and her family and said that they gave her a lot of respect

 argedy supremeo lalu prasad yadav ne 21 disambar ko nitish kumaar sarkaar ke baaluu khanan niti ke khilaaf bihar band kaa aahvaan kiya he, magar bihar band ke aahvaan kii hawa nikaalane ke liye jediu ne is puure maamle ko ek nayaa twist de diya
 The JDU has alleged that Lalu Prasad called the Bihar bandh on December 21, not against the Nitish government, but against the Sikh society
 guru govind singh ji ke 350wein janmotsav kaa samaapan samarohgauratlab he ki 23 disambar se 25 disambar ke bich sikhon ke dasven guru, guru govind singh ji ke 350wein janm utsav kaa samaapan samaaroh patna main manaaya janaa he
 The 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh Ji as Prakash Parv was celebrated throughout the year and the Bihar government is going to celebrate the closing ceremony of this year-long program as a shukra ceremony, which is attended by people from the Sikh community from all over the world
 Are about to reach Patna
 isi kaarykram ko lekar jediu ne lalu par hamalaa bolaa he or aarope lagaaya he ki sikhon ke itane bade kaarykram se 2 din pehle lalu dwaara bihar band kaa aahvaan karnaa sikh samudaay kaa apmaan he
 The JDU said that when the year-long Prakash Parv was started in January this year, the celebrations organized by the Nitish government were praised all over the world, but during the closing ceremony, Lalu called Bihar to the world Want to humiliate the table jadyu pravaktaa sanjay singh ne kaha ki 20 disambar ke baad se sikh samudaay ke log train or hawaii jahaaj ke madhyam se patna aana shuru ho jaaenge, magar aise main bihar band kaa aahvaan karnaa sikh samudaay ke logon ko na keval pareshaani main daalana he balki unhen apamaanit karnaa he
 Another party spokesperson Neeraj Kumar linked the issue of support given by the Congress to Lalu's call for Bihar bandh with the 1984 Sikh riots, saying, "sikhs have never been respected in the eyes of Congress, whether it was 1984 Sikh riots Or the event of the Shukra ceremony to be held now
 ' niraj kumaar ne kaha ki sikh samudaay ke itane bade kaarykram se pehle bihar band kaa aahvaan karke argedy or congress ne sabit kar diya he ki yah partiyaan dharmanirpekshata kaa keval dikhaava or dhong karti he
 The bandh was earlier called on 18 December
 It is notable that Lalu had called the Bihar bandh on December 18 to protest against the sand mining policy, but on the same day, due to the election results of Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, Lalu gave his program of Bihar bandh Was deferred to 21 December
 sutron ke mutabik isaki vajah yah thi ki party ko laga usee dingujarator himachal ke chunavi nattejey aane kii vajah se unke bihar band kaarykram ko media kawarej nahin mil paaegi or vah flop sho ho jayega
 It is also necessary to mention here that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is currently visiting the districts in the first round of the Vikas Samiti Yatra, has canceled his second round of Samadhi Yatra in view of the Shukraana ceremony and December 23 to 25 Will be present and will be involved in the program

 In the last two decades in Rajasthan, there has been a change of power in every election
 is baar bhi rajya kii janata ne ek baar phir congress par bharosa jataate hue is parampara ko barkaraar rakhaa he
 However, the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is setting the record of victory under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, made claims of changing history this time, but he remained a mere election proclamation
 maujuuda chunaav nateezon se ek baat ye bhi spasht hoti dikh rahi he ki mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ke khilaaf jis gusse kii baat kii ja rahi thi or agsit pole main congress dwaara clin sweep karne ke jo aankade saamne aa rahe the, asal nattejey usase ulat aa rahe hai
 During the election campaign in Rajasthan, even though slogans like 'no hate to Modi, Vasundhara Teri Khair nahi' are heard, but bjp's performance is considered to be honorable
 darasal, 2003 or 2008 or 2013 ke chunavi nateezon ko dekha jaae har chunaav main satta parivartan hua, lekin bijepi or congress ke bich siton kaa antar dilachasp rahaa he
 The BJP won 120 seats in the 2003 assembly elections and formed the BJP government under Vasundhara Raje
 raaje ne pehali baar rajya kii kaman sanbhali thi
 After this, when the 2008 elections were held, the Congress got 96 seats and the BJP was reduced to 22 seats with a majority of 78 seats
 yani satta virdohi lahar hone ke baavjood 2008 main vasundhara raaje ke netritv main bijepi ko 78 siten milin
 At the same time, when talking about the 2013 assembly elections, the BJP not only ousted the Congress, but won 163 seats unilaterally and the Congress was reduced to just 21 seats
 philhal, ab tak ke jo nattejey aa rahe hai, unamem congress bahumat ke aakande se jarur aage bad gai he, lekin bijepi bhi 80 se zyada siton par badhat banaae hue he
 Another reason is that the leadership of Vasundhara Raje was being questioned in the corridors of power
 saath hi baar-baar ye bhi aarope lag rahe the ki vasundhara raaje or bijepi ke sheersh netritv main talmail sahi nahin he, jiske chalate party main aantarik kalah kii charchaa ho rahi thi
 When Vasundhara Raje went ahead with all the factionalism in the election, the BJP did not shy away from the majority figure, going beyond the unilateral results of the exit poll
 haalanki, abhi final nattejey aane baaki hai

 Asumal Thaumal Harpalani, popularly known as Asaram Bapu with a long white beard, narrowly escaped an accident in August last year
 gujarat ke godhra main unka helicopter kareeb 100 foot kii oonchai se jameen par gir gaya tha
 Three people, including Baba and the driver, survived the accident as they tied belts and the machine did not explode
 72 varshiya asaram ne ise ishwar kaa chamatkaar bataaya, varanaa unka bhi vahi haal hota jo aisi durghatnaon main netaaon kaa hota rahaa he
 Baba boasted in one of his sermons and even said, "where the Chief Minister and the minister disappeared in such accidents, no one knows
 ”lekin jab duniyaadaari kaa maamla aayaa or un par kanoonee shikanja ksaa to asaram apane rajnatik samparkon par hi nirbhar ho gaye hai
 They start feeling that without political help they cannot do anything
 uttar pradesh main shahjahanpur ke ek dampati ne baba par 15 agast kii raat unki 16 varshiya beti ke saath yon utpeeda kaa aarope lagaaya, tabase baba giraftaar ke dar se bachate aa rahe hai
 The Rajasthan Police summoned him to come for questioning by 30 August and came back
 police 27 agast ko indore main unke farmahouse par gai thi
 On the same day, four cases of rape were discussed in the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly, but Baba's case remained silent
 vipaksh ke netaa gulab chand kataaria ne to police ke is deele ravaiye ko jaij tehraane kii koshish karte hue kaha ki baba ko log ‘sat’ maanate hai
 Born in Birani village of mechanic Babasindh (now in Pakistan), Baba was a bicycle mechanic in Ahmedabad until the mid-seventh decade
 lekin ab unke paas 8,000 karod ru
 Has a vast empire and has millions of followers
 kathith yon duraachaar kii ghatana jodhpur ke nikat manaai gaanv main bane ek farmahouse main hui thi
 The victim was asked to go alone to Baba's room
 ladki ne 19 agast ko dilli police ko bayaan diya ki us kamare main baba “us par savaar pret atmaaon” ko bhagane kaa anushthan karne vaale the
 According to the statement, Asaram took off the girl's shirt and started caressing her breasts and then asked her to perform blowjobs
 jab usne aisa karne se manaa kar diya to unhone dhamkaaya ki vah kabhi apana munh na khole
 a case has been registered against Asaram under sections 376, 342, 506 and 509 of IPC
 iske alaava bal yon aparaadh nirodhak kanoon or kishor nyaay kanoon ke tahat bhi maamla darj kiya gaya he, jisamen adhiktam umr kaid kii sajaa kaa praavdhaan he
 However, Asaram told reporters in Indore, "the allegations against me are ridiculous and baseless
 mujhe sajeesh ke tahat fansaaya ja rahaa he
 "but the Jodhpur police consider the allegations against Asaram to be serious and are denying the conspiracy
 ladki kaa parivaar asaram kaa bahut bada bhakt tha
 The girl's father has his own transport business
 unhone shahjahanpur ke paas baba ke liye ek chota-sa ashram bhi banwaaya tha
 The girl, studying at Asaram's ashram in Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh, told her parents about the incident when she arrived at her home the next day
 tab tak asaram jodhpur se dilli aa chuke the
 When Asaram refused to meet the victim's family in Delhi, the family lodged a complaint with the Delhi Police
 baba is bich lagaataar sthaan badalte rahe
 He first sat in his ashram in Indore and then moved to the ashram in Surat, where he celebrated the Janmashtami festival in front of a crowd of 50,000 of his devotees
 ve yah dikhaanaa chaahate the ki is vivaad se unke bhakton kii sankhya kam nahin hui he
 But this new charge on Baba has lengthened the list of alleged crimes against him
 un par pichley paanch varshon main is tarah ke aarope pehle bhi lag chuke hai
 Last year, he gave a very insensitive statement on the December 16 gang rape in Delhi, in which he said, "the mistake is not one sided
" ” unke khilaaf lage aaropon main auraton kaa shoshan, jameen hadapna, shishyon par hamale karwaanaa or galat tareekon se dhan jutanaa shaamil hai
 In July 2008, the bodies of two boys, Abhishek Vaghela (8 years) and Dipesh Vaghela (9 years) studying in his ashram in Ahmedabad, were found on the banks of the Sabarmati river and many of their limbs were missing
 bacchon kii maut ke peeche tona-totaka kiye jane kaa andeh tha
 The report has been submitted to the Gujarat government after five years of investigation
 bharose ke sathibaharhaal, bhadde-se-bhadde vivaadon se bhi raajnneeti main asaram ke samarthakon kii sankhya kam nahin hui he
 In 2011 alone he was the official guest of seven Congress and BJP ruled states
 pichley do varshon main chhattisgarh, madhya pradesh, punjab ke mukhyamantri unka saarvajanik swaagat kar chuke hai
 On 22 August, former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Uma Bharti said, "they are being targeted for opposing Sonia and Rahul Gandhi
" ” rajasthan main congress ke vidhayak pratap singh khachariyavaas kaa aarope he ki ki hindu voton kaa nuksaan hone ke dar se hi police baba ke khilaaf jane se kataraa rahi he
 At the same time, women activists say that the state government has given a lot of time to Baba "to make the matter happen
" asaram kaa kahana he ki ladki ke mata-pita aisa aarope lagane ke liye khud hi maafee maangenge
 The Union Home Ministry has written to the Government of Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh to report complaints against Asaram
 jodhpur ke police ayukta bi
 Yes
 joseph kehete hai, “unhen apane khilaaf aaropon ko galat sabit karne ke liye thos saboot dene kii jarurat hogi
 "the BJP will not make Asaram a public issue for fear of loss of female votes, but he hopes that Baba's followers can get angry with Congress and give him their vote
 lagata he ab baba netaaon kaa nahin, balki netaa hi baba kaa istemaal karne vaale hai

 Although in 2009, Naranbhai lost by a small margin, but in 2014, Ramsingh Rathwa went ahead with the Modi wave

 He surprised his audience, including many of the world's famous chefs, restaurant owners, food writers and foodies, by revealing a dish made from Indore's famous street food "bhutte Ke Khees"
 unhone jo vyanjan taiyaar kiya uskaa mukhya ghatak makai yaa bhutta he
 They decorated her in such a way that she could be included in the menu of any luxurious restaurant
 yahi to kisi vyanjan kii visheshta he
 It does not matter where it originated, from which level

 Dishes prepared with love, love and skill take you on a journey of golden memories of the past, as well as to encourage you to mention it
 bahut se pakwaan kisi shahar ke liye khaane-pine se judi uski yaadon kaa ek avibhajya hissaa ban jate hai—or jo restaraan in laajawab vyanjanon ko ham tak pahunchaate hai, ve peedi dar peedi hamen lalachaate rahete hai
 At least in India, it is not the case that only luxurious restaurants have become famous here, where only the rich people or the travelers coming from all over the world have come and gone

 The purpose of this special issue is not to indulge your curiosity by reading it with a cup of tea and a plate of pakoras, but rather it will provoke the food lover inside you to search for delicious dishes
 aapako agali baar jab kabhi in jagahon par jane kaa mauka mili, to aap un jagahon kii talash main jane se khud ko roak na paaen jahaan hamaare samvaadadaata pahunche or aapke liye lekar aae jaayke se bharpoor kahaniyaan

 How is it possible that India, known for its history and heritage, does not have the tradition of its dishes, its food and drink habits? hamaare desh main darasal bhojan kaa rishta sirf pet bharne yaa jeebh ko swaad kii saiyr karaane bhar se nahin hota; balki yah to sadiyon puraani apni ravaayaton ke saath logon ko jode rahanaa kaa jariya bhi banataa he
 These are the dishes that keep reminding us of their fragrance, their tastes and customs
 jab bhi ham parampara ke bare main baat karte hai, hamaare jehan main kareem kii vah tasviir ubhar aati he—kisi restaraan ke daravaaje ke pravesh dwaar ke paas rakhi corme kii ek badi si deg ke peeche baitha ek shaks jo corme kii tari ko is andaaj main parosata tha ki uskaa masala, ghi or tel main doobane kii bajaay apni jagah rob se kaayam rahe
 This special style of serving brought Kareem such fame that later on it was believed that Korma is actually served in the same way that Haji Karimuddin served in his small dhaba started in 1913
 kai baar kudarat bhi hamaare liye jaayke ke intjaam main apane kartab dikhaati he
 Take the fish of Amritsar, whose name has become synonymous with this city
 jab hamane laurence road par amritsari machhlee ke liye mashhoor makkhan fish and chikan corner par makkhan sa mulaayam fish tikka khaaya to dukaan ke maalik se isaki racippi poochne se roak nahin paaya
 There is something amazing in the waters of the Beas River passing through this holy city settled by Guru Ramdas, which is the most delicious Sol and Singhara fish lay eggs in its water
 inasaani haath kabhi-kabhi jaadu bhi kar detaa he
 What about the jollabhora message of Girish Chandra Dey and Nakur Chandra Nandi's sweet shop opened in 1844 near Hatibagan in Kolkata, whose unique taste and reputation still stands? Or of

 Das's spongy Rasgulla, whose fame has remained the same since 1855, and his fans continue to grow from generation to generation
 yaa bhim chandra naag ke nolan gud sandesh jo 1826 lekar ab tak bina ruke waisi hi shaan se bik rahaa he? inhen jagahon ne mithai premiyon kii kai peedhishon kaa kolkata ke saath rishta jode rakhaa he
 And Bangla also has the distinction of being such a sweet language that the two Bhadralok Bengalis may have been galleys of each other, yet you will not get to know it with the accent of language! The beauty of India's food culture is that it has new experiments
 Has always been welcomed
 aapako manipur ke kisi vaishnav ghar main bhi bina pyaaj-lahasun kaa behtareen shaakaahaari bhojan mil saktaa he
 In 1704 King Charai Roquba became a Vaishnava (sect of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu) and from then onwards a legacy of such food was prepared
 duusari taraf, mandiron kaa pavitra shahar madurai bhi he, jiske bare main aapkaa anumaan ho saktaa he ki yah shahar shaakaahaar kaa sakhti se paalan karata hoga lekin yah un muniyandi vilaas bhojanalayon kaa udgam sthaan he, jiskaa sabase pramukh vyanjan he matan biryani

 The mutton of Champaran, especially in northern Bihar, is now slowly gaining its place
 motihaari, patna ke baad isane dilli main bhi dastak de di he
 Similarly, the Balushahi of Runnisaidpur is reaching far and wide through Sudha
 isaki khubi yah he ki ise maide kii bajaae chhene se taiyaar kiya jaataa he or rasagulle kii tarah chaashni main dubaa diya jaataa he
 It is natural to have a variety of dishes in the country where the Lord is offered
 uttar pradesh ke vibhinn shaharon kii galiyon main khanpan kii samskruti se judi kahaniyaan hai
 In Lucknow, the crowds at outlets ranging from Rattilal's Khaste and Bajpai Kachori to Tunde Kabbi show the craze for their traditional recipes
 aapane shaayad hi kabhi yah kalpana kii ho ki thanjavur jaise chote shahar main aise shandaar matan kebab milte honge jise khaakar pet to bhar saktaa he, par man nahin
 Well, this city of temples attributes its existence to the Maratha Raj who ruled the city for two centuries
 agar lok katha par vishwaas kiya jaae to dakshin bhartiya daal sambar thanjavur ke maratha shaasha sarfoji dwitiya ke rasoiyon kaa avishkaar tha, lekin ve rasoie apane dharmanirpeksh raja ke liye kebab banane main bhi utane hi nipun the, jo sthaneey dargah ke prati bhi utane hi udaar the jitne isai mishnariyon ke liye
 India's food story thrives in living examples of its shared culture
 isane apana mul astitv ganvaae bina sabhi pramukh sabhyataaon se mili sakaaratmak chizon ko aatmsaat kiya he
 We were told that the dishes of Hyderabad bear the impression of Persian, Kayastha, Turkish, Telangana and Barkas and are all cocktails
 lekin yah "barkas'' kya bhalaa he? padtaal main pataa chalaa ki yah shabd angreji shabd "barrax'' kaa apbhransh he or yah charminar ke bagal vaali jagah kaa naam bhi he jahaan nizaam kii sena rahaa karti thi
 Traditionally, the Nizam had reinstated troops from the Hazramaut region south of the Arabian Peninsula in his army

 We believe that the dishes have also overtaken Bollywood in their expression of the Socratic power of India

 And yes, thank the upstairs who gave you the opportunity to call this rich heritage your heritage

 But it is not correct to say that the team lacks a high level of fitness
 yah lagbhag aisa kehane ke samaan he ki bharatiyon ko viketon ke bich main daudna yaa kaich pakadana nahin aata
 Even Sachin Tendulkar has caught some extremely difficult catches
 ummid he, bharatiyon ko yah yaad hoga
 The World Cup is starting to heat up, so fielding will become very important now
 fielding or fitness do alag-alag chijen hai or dhoni ke ladke inamen katai peeche nahin hai, lekin team kii gendbaaji kii kshamta ko lekar mujhe kuch samasya jarur dikhi
 For any team, fitness and fielding are qualities that should be inherent in a player because they are both very important for the player's success on the field
 ek asafal ballebaaj shandaar ran outs karaane main bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he or ek asafal gendbaaj teji se bhaag kar kuch atirikt ran bachaa saktaa he
 Both matter a lot

 As the game progresses, the player begins to feel pressured
 paseene se tarbatar hone ke kaaran kai baar vah gend par najar nahin rakh paata or behad najuk maukon par kaich nahin pakad paata kyonki hatheli main paseene ke kaaran gend phisal jaati he
 Many of Dhoni's young players are super fit

 Players will have to score fast runs, take fast wickets and stop extra runs
 unhen ucch str kii fitness banaae rakhni hogi
 Many people say that a big score will help to win
 lekin yah sahi nahin he
 The runs that will be saved will make the difference between victory and defeat
 ek baar phir yahaan fitness kii baat aati he
 Dhoni is also worried because some catches have been dropped and some extra runs have to be given
 lekin inaki vajah se unhen koi match nahin ganvaana padaa he

 yahi nahin, party ke netaa apane barkhaast mantri kii tulana mahatma gandhi se bhi kar rahe hai
 It is worth noting that Anna Hazare has said in a statement after the Sandeep Kumar sex CD scandal that Kejriwal's conduct has disappointed him and he also expressed his displeasure

 1
 There are rounds in cricket
 1980 ke daur main vivian richards or uske baad bryan lara or sachin tendulkar kaa daur tha
 But Virat is the most complete batsman
 ve donon pairon se baraabar movement karte hue field ke kisi bhi hisse main stroke lagaate hai
 2
 imran ne kaha ki wo sirf talented hi nahin balki behtareen player hai
 He is ahead of Sachin in the matter of temperature
 viraat ne behad mushkil halaat main bhi shandaar khel dikhaaya he

 Former England batsman Nick Compton said Duncan Fletcher has undergone a difficult transition in Indian cricket after retiring from a number of legends and deserves credit for guiding the current team's pace bowling attack
 bhartiya tej gendbaajon ne trent brij main 20 main se 19 wicket liye
 India defeated England by 203 runs in this match
 compton ne kaha ki jis tarah se flechar ne james anderson or stuart broad ko unke shuruaati daur main sahi rasta dikhaaya tha usee tarah se vartmaan ke bhartiya tej gendbaajon (umesh yadav, mohammad shami or bhubaneshwar kumaar) ko zimbabwe ke is sammaneey coach se mili salaah kaa phayda mila
 On comparing Kohli to Sachin, Veeru told who is the great batsman, Compton said, 'the Indian fast attack did not suddenly reach this level
 isamen samay laga or isamen dhire-dhire sudhaar hua
 All these bowlers took time
 bharat ke paas pehle itane adhik tej gendbaaj nahin hua karte the lekin ab unke paas hai
 Compton said, "most of them have played as Fletcher's coach at some time, so they are credited
" (tej gendbaaji akraman ko sanvaarane kii) yah prakriya kaaphi pehle shuru ho gai thi, lekin ab jaakar ve sabhi milakar acha pradarshan kar rahe hai
 Compton was asked what difference he now sees, he said, "the difference from the former is that these fast bowlers do not compromise fast
 jaise ki james anderson or stuart broad teji ke saath gend ko move karne kii kshamta rakhte hai
 Nick, the grandson of the great Dennis Compton, believes that the Indian team management should also give players like Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane a chance to progress

 Now that Pujara and Rahane are scoring runs, the work will become easier for India
 'unhone kaha, ‘bharat ne nottingham main jeet darj kii or use acchhee santulit team mil gai he
 There seems to be no need to change it
 agar viraat (chauthe test kii team main) koi badlaav karte hai, to dekhnaa dilachasp hoga
 'compton said,' Virat has made many changes in terms of selection
 udhaaharan ke liye pehle test match se pujaara ko baahar rakhane ke galat faisle ko anumati dene se team prabandhan kii kamajori kaa pataa chalata he
 He said, "when Virat makes so many changes, it might not be easy for players like Pujara and Rahane
 ve dabadabaa rakhane vaale vyakti nahin hai or is tarah ke khilaadiyon ko kai baar is tarah ke faislon se saamanjasy bithaane main dikkat ho sakati he

 manch kaa sanchaalan rahul kanwal, news diarector, tivi today network ne kiya
 AIUDF leader Aminul Islam, while giving his opinion on this important topic that has become a hot topic in the country, said that the Assam Movement took place in the 80s in Assam, killing about 10,000 people
 uske baad assam acord 1985 aayaa
 The fix date for identifying foreigners was 25 March 1971
 uske aadhaar par citigenship act lagu hua
 The question is that NRC has been done in Assam, now all is clear how many Muslims came from Bangladesh, and are foreigners
 lekin yah bhi saamne aayaa ki 12 lakh hindu enarasi main shaamil nahin ho paae
 When he was asked the question whether your party got people to make illegal papers so that they could vote for you, he said that no one could make 51, 62 or later papers, all of them were Indian citizens
 ab log kah rahe hai ki wo kagajaat jhuthe the
 Why Muslims came to India after becoming Bangladesh is a question

 They are being harassed in Bangladesh

 This happened in the BJP government
 yah supreme court ke supervijan main hua
 56 thousand employees of Assam were engaged in this NRC process
 5 saal tak wo lagaataar yahi kaam karte rahe
 Now it's done
 19 lakh log jo saamne aae yah kareeb 50 deshon kii puri jansankhya se bhi zyada he
 Now if we look at the whole country, this number can be in crores, so this is happening
 ham supreme court kii manshaa par andeh nahin kar sakate
 But crores of rupees have been spent in it
 kai karod kagajaton kii jaanch ho chuki he

 Kher said that the project can be started in an area of 10 sq km and with construction of world class infrastructure in the selected area which can be ideal for the country
 unhone kaha, ‘pehali smart city kashmir main kashmiri panditon ke liye ho
 Since those who settle there may be Kashmiri Hindus in the initial phase but anyone will be allowed to stay there
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘zyaadaatar pandit shikshit peshewar hai jo vahaan basengen
 i do not know who coined the term 'separate slum' but must have coined a sick mentality
 pruthak basti or usee sthaan par aane or basane ke liye kahe jane ke bich antar he
 When Kher was asked if that smart city was only marked for pundits, he said, 'initially Kashmiri Pandits should settle there
 baad main anya log bhi aa sakate hai
 We are not against Muslims in the valley
 ’ The Kashmiri Pandit Kher himself said that the Pandits could not return to their original places because they did not feel safe there and most of their properties have been captured, seized or forced to sell at a paltry price
 
 unhone kaha, ‘teen fisadi ke liye un 97 fisadi ke saath ghul-mil janaa sambhav nahin hoga jinhone hamen khaded diya or aap us ilaake main nahin ja sakate jahaan aapke puraane jakhm hai
 This is not a hindu-muslim issue

 They should proceed on this plan
 paanch chah log use bandhak nahin bana sakate
