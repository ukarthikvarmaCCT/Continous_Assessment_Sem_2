 The Samajwadi Party (SP) got a thumping majority in the assembly elections held about six months ago
 is bahumat ke boote hi sapa kii satta main vaapasi hui
 It was only after assuming the office of Chief Minister that Akhilesh said that all the promises made to the people in the elections will be fulfilled and even after six months he is seen saying from the platform that the promises made to the people will be fulfilled
 baharhaal, mukhyamantri ke pad par asin hone ke saath hi unke pita or sapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh mulaayam singh yadav ne bhi kaha tha ki akhilesh ko chah maah kaa samay diya janaa chahie lekin beete lagbhag chah maheene ke dauraan kai aise maukey aae jab akhilesh ko apano kii vajah se sharmidagi uthaani padi
 On the completion of six months of the SP government, a plan is being prepared to organize the programs on September 15, which will highlight the achievements of Akhilesh
 isamen kanya vidyadhan, berogari bhatta, kisaanon kii karj maafee, kisaanon par se mukademon ko waapas lene or chaatro ko laptop evam tablet dene kii yojana kaa gungan kiye jane kii ummid he
 During the last six months, Azam Khan, who is close to Mulayam and the Minister for Urban Development, has also been creating problems for Akhilesh and sometimes Mulayam
 kai maukon par unki manamaani ke aage akhilesh or unke pita ko bhi jhukna padaa
 The nearest ministers announced such decisions to Akhilesh, which also had to be changed after the trouble
 vidhansabha ke satr ke dauraan akhilesh ne vidhayakon ko apni nidhi se gaadi kharidne kii anumati die jane kii ghoshnaa kii thi lekin agle hi din unhen apane faisle se peeche hatana padaa tha
 After this, Azam, the Akhilesh government's minister of power, announced in the assembly that there is a power crisis in the state, so the government will not provide electricity to malls and restaurants after seven in the evening
 lage haath shivpal ne bhi unke sur main sur mila diya
 The next day a series of protests began, so the government had to back down once again with its decision

 There are clashes between the SP and the police on a daily basis
 sapaayiyon ke isi ravaiye ko dekhte hue mulaayam ko khud aage aakar unhen anushaasan main rahane kii naseehat deni padi
 Criminal incidents increased within about six months after the formation of the SP government

 Shivpal Yadav alleged the use of government money in Mayawati's bungalow but the government turned back from conducting an inquiry the next day
 iske baad shivpal ne purv sahakaarita mantri swami prasad maury par ghotaale kaa aarope lagaaya gaya lekin jab maury ne palatwaar kiya to shivpal is maamle se hi kanni katate najar aae
 Apart from this, Shivpal caused many problems for the government with his controversial statements
 ajam khan bhi shivpal se peeche nahin rahe
 He left the work of the department regarding the matter of appointing the Municipal Commissioner
 ruthe ajam ko manaane ke liye sarkaar ko en
 P

 Similarly, Azam bowed to the government several times in front of his persistence
 sutron kii maane to imam bukhari se mulaayam kii najdiki ajam ko raas nahin aa rahi he
 On the completion of three months of Akhilesh government, Mulayam gave 100 numbers out of 100 to his son, now it will be interesting to see how many numbers he gives to his son on September 15, when he completes six months
 is sambandh main bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ke pradesh pravaktaa kehete hai ki chah maheenon ke kaarykaal ke dauraan sarkaar har morche par vifal sabit hui he
 Cases of corruption were exposed, but there was no large-scale action in the last six months
 sarkaar chah maheenon ke dauraan bhrashtachar se samjhauta karti hi najar ai
 Pathak said that the government had to face the issue of law and order
 17 agast ko rajdhani kii sadakon par utpaat hua lekin police kuch nahin kar pai or baaki hisson main jo ghatnaayen huin unamem police ne logon ko dauda-dauda kar peeta isse police ke do chehre saamne aae
 On the question of the completion of six months of Akhilesh government, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) state president Ramchal Rajbhar said that if we talk about the first six months, then the government has completely failed on every issue
 uplabdhiyaan to koi he hi nahin
 Mulayam Singh sometimes gives 100 numbers to his son and sometimes zero number, now this time let's see what he says

 Meanwhile, information has been received that the order for the transfer of Durga was issued by opening the office at midnight

 aakhir wo koun si vajah thi jiske chalate aanan-fanan main aadhi raat ko durga shakti nagpal ko nilambit kiya gaya
 Was Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav informed of this and what was the reason that the next morning Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was seen supporting the suspension
 party pravaktaa rajendra choudhary kaa kahana he ki tabadalaa or nilamban kisi bhi mukhyamantri kaa visheshadhikaar hota he
 No questions should be raised on this

 sarkaar bhale hi ye tark de rahi he ki durga kaa tabadalaa dharm sthal kii diwaar todane ke maamle main kiya gaya
 But the fact is that Durga had to face suspension due to stopping illegal mining

 Fifteen cases of illegal mining were detected in Noida between 18-24 July
 teen jesibi or chalis gaadiyaan jaise damper, tactor, trali aadi jabt kar liye gayi
 Due to this, people engaged in illegal mining of sand from Yamuna and Hindon suffered a lot
 isse naaraaz khanan mafiaon ne sabase pehle khanan adhikari ashish kumaar kaa tabadalaa karaayaa
 He was relieved from there on 25 July and then three days later SDM Durga Shakti Nagpal was also suspended
 avaidh khanan ke bare main samaajawaadee sarkaar ke mantri ajam khan ke mutabik ye to kudarat kii dein he isapar sabakaa haq he
 Chant the name of Rama

 Currently, suspense remains on the withdrawal of Durga Shakti's suspension

 gujarat vidhansabha main mahilaon ke pratinidhitiv par bhaajapa kii rashtriya sachiv vaani treepathi se puche gaye sawaal par unhone kaha, 'bijepi hameshaa se hi mahilaon ko vyavastha se jodne kii koshish karti ai he or haal ke varsho main gujarat main aisa dekha bhi gaya he
 It is okay that relatively women have not reached the assembly
 lekin yah lambi prakriya he
 It is expected that soon the representation of women in the Assembly will increase
 'ek taraf sansad or vidhansabha main 33 fisadi mahila aarakshan kii baat kahi jaati he lekin vahiin gujarat jaise rajya main 1,666 ummidavaaron main mahila ummidavaaron kii sankhya sirf 91 thi
 These women candidates contested elections on the strength of Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP) including big parties like Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
 inamen se congress ne 14 or bhaajapa ne sirf 16 mahila ummidavaar hi maidan main utaare
 Talk about the result and only 14 women candidates of BJP and 4 candidates of Congress were able to prove their claim in the assembly while the account of other parties could not be opened
 lekin in sabake baavjood kuch aisi mahilaayein bhi thim jinaki charchaa har taraf ho rahi thi jinhone gujarat ke kaddavar netaaon ke saamne khadey hone kii himmat dikhaai
 Shweta Bhatt, wife of suspended IPS officer Sanjeev Bhatt, who contested against Modi from Maninagar on a Congress ticket, however had to face defeat and Modi won her by a huge margin of 86,373 votes
 ek anya mahila ummidavaar gujarat ke purv grahamantri or bijepi netaa divangat hiren pandya kii patni jaagruthi pandya jipipi ke tikat par khadi hui thim jinhen bijepi ke rakesh shah ne 97,566 vot se haraaya
 However, in contrast to this defeat, another truth is that bjp's female candidate Anandi Patel got more votes than all the candidates of the state
 unhone ahmedabad ke ghatlodiya seat se congress ke rameshbhai prahlada bhai patel ko haraaya
 Apart from this, Vibha Vardawe of BJP defeated Rajesh Joshi of Congress from Bhavnagar East seat by 39,508 votes, bjp's other candidate Neema Ben Acharya defeated Amir Ali Haji Hussain of Congress from Bhuj by nearly nine thousand votes
 vahiin congress kii taraf se savita ben khant ne morava hadaf seat se bhaajapa ke bijalbhai damor ko haraaya
 However, she fell unconscious while counting votes and died in hospital on Friday
 congress kii ek anya ummidavaar chandrika ben baaria ne garbada seat se bijepi ke mahendra ben rathore ko haraaya
 The population of women in Gujarat is around two and a half crores and perhaps this is the reason why after her victory, Chief Minister Narendra Modi has expressed gratitude to the women of the state who participated in the voting
 modi kii is jeet ke baad ab unke pradhanmantri pad kii daavedaari par charchaa joro par he or kahin na kahin unki is daavedaari ko bihar ke mukhyamantri niteesha kumaar se chunauti mil rahi he or vahiin bihar kii pichhali vidhansabha ke nattejey dekhen to yahaan 243 vidhansabha seat par 32 mahilaayein kabiz hui hai

 Kumar, Ranjit Singhji, one of the greatest cricketers of India, has a wonderful record
 angrejon kii taraf se khilne vaale is bhartiya diggaj ne aaj hi (22 agast) 1896 main itihaas rachaa tha
 In fact, he did the feat of scoring two centuries in a single day in first class cricket
 ranjit singhji ne ek maheene pehle hi england kii ore se test (july 1896) main padaarpan karte hue naabad 154 ran banaae the or usee form ko jari rakhte hue england ke shahar hov main sasex kii ore se khelte hue yorkshaire ke khilaaf ek hi din main do shatkeey (100 or naabad 125 ran) paariyaan kheli thim
 Playing for Sussex, Karanymorkshire scored 407 runs in their first innings while playing first
 jawaab main sasex kii team tisare din ranjit singhji ke shatak (100 ran) ke baavjood 191 ranon par simat gai or foloon nahin bachaa pai
 After this, Ranjit Singhji again scored an unbeaten 125 in the follow-on innings and showed the charisma of scoring two centuries in a single day
 ranjit singhji ke shatak kii badaulat sasex ne 260 / 2 ran bana match bachaa liya
 FACTS - Also became the third batsman from Sussex to score two centuries in a single match
 lekin isse bhi badhkar first class cricket main ek hi din do shatak jamaane vaale ekmaatr cricketer bane
 - No batsman has done such a feat in first-class cricket since Ranjit Singhji
 haalanki western australia kii ore se khelte hue mathew aliot ne 31 disambar 1995 ko 104 ran or uske baad foloon pari main 135 ran banaae the
 Eliot was then unbeaten by scoring 98 runs in the first innings the day before
 is vajah se aliot ke shatakon kii tulana ranjit singhji se nahin kii ja sakati
 Yes, Spanish batsman Tariq Ali Awan had scored an unbeaten 150 and 148 runs on 4 September 2012 in the European Championship Division-2 T20 on the same day
 tab esthonia ke khilaaf tarik ne 66 gendon main naabad 150 or usee din agle match main portugal ke khilaaf semifinal main 148 ran banaae the
 However, his team missed the final
 ranjit singhji kaa kariyar1
 Ranjit Singhji landed in 15 Test matches for England and all these matches were against Australia
 unhone bharat ke liye kabhi koi match nahin khelaa
 2
 vah pehle bhartiya rahe jinhone england kii taraf se test cricket khele3
 He scored 989 test runs 44
 95 kii ausat se banaae, unka ucchtam score 175 rahaa4
 In 1915, Ranji was injured during hunting and lost the right eye light 5
 desh kaa pratishthit first class cricket toornament- ranjai trophy inhen ke naam par he It was being talked about not talking to Kashmir, then it was discussed in Kashmir in Parliament, it was decided that we will talk to Kashmir but will not talk to anyone on Kashmir, now whenever we talk, Pakistan will talk on Kashmir
 rajyasabha main samaajawaadee party ke netaa ramgopal yadav ne kaha tha ki bharat paak adhikrut kashmir kaa masalaa kyon nahin uthaata he
 The Prime Minister raised the issue of Balochistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir in an all-party meeting
 sabane sahmati de di lekin kisi ko andaaza nahin tha ki pradhanmantri laal qile se bhi ye baat kah denge
 The Prime Minister had said, 'people about whom i have never met, but people sitting far away like this greet the Prime Minister of India, then it is an honor for my 1
25 billion people and therefore this respect , i want to express my heartfelt gratitude today to the people of Balochistan who express their thanks, to the people of Gilgit, to the people of Pakistan who are in possession of Pakistan
 ' Can this gratitude be understood as India's active support? 12 agast ke sarvadaleey baithak baad america sthit gilgit blatistan neshnal congress naam kaa ek sanghathan he jisane maanavadhikaar ke hanan kaa maamla uthaane par bharat ke pradhanmantri kaa aabhaar vyakt kiya or balooch netaa brahmadagh bagooti ne bhi pradhanmantri kaa swaagat kiya he
 Are these organizations so important to India that the Prime Minister expressed his gratitude for the place of all-party meeting with the Red Fort
 jise ham paak adhikrut kashmir kehete hai use pakistan main do hisson main baanta gaya he
 Azad Kashmir and second Gilgit Baltistan
 bharat kii 106 kimi seemaa afghanistan main padati he jo paak adhikrut kashmir main padati he
 In May, India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval told BSF officials that we also have to keep in mind the 106-km border that borders Afghanistan
 gilgit blatistan ek hissaa china se lagata he
 This is a very beautiful area
 duniya kii duusari sabase oonchi chotii ke-2 yaheen he
 On 22 February 1994, the Parliament passed a resolution during the Narasimha Rao government stating that in view of the growing terrorist violence and Pakistan's efforts to raise the Kashmir dispute, both houses of the Indian Parliament adopted a resolution on 22 February 1994 Passed which emphasized that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India and Pakistan should vacate its occupied Kashmir areas
 oktober 2015 main sanyukt raashtra sangh main videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj kaa bayaan he ki ki agar pioke videshi shaktiyon ke kabze main he to wo videshi shakti pakistan he
 Twice this year, in the months of January and June, the Ministry of External Affairs, Vikas Swaroop had also said that the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir which also includes the region of gilgit-baltistan is an integral part of India
 baluchistan ko lekar khaasaa hadakamp he
 Balochistan is one of the four administrative provinces of Pakistan
 iske alaava teen anya praant hai, punjab, kaibar pakhtun khwaah or sindh
 The territory of Balochistan is bordered by Afghanistan and Iran
 pakistan kaa sabase bada praant he magar aabaadi bahut kam he
 Baluchistan is also poor being equipped with minerals
 yahaan par balooch rashtriyata ko lekar alag alag guton ke andolan chal rahe hai
 Those who know the politics of this region say that Pakistan has inflicted extreme persecution on the Baloch people
 pakistan unke andolan ko ugravad maanata he
 Many Baloch leaders are living in different countries
 guadar bandargah baluchistan main hi he jise china bana rahaa he
 In response to this, India has taken the responsibility of building Chabahar port in Iran
 2009 ke saal main bhi baluchistan ko lekar bharat kii raajnneeti main ghamaasan ho chukaa he
 On 16 July that year, India and Pakistan issued a joint statement to Sharm el-sheikh of the Daily Egypt that both countries agreed that both were at risk from terrorism
 donon netaa is baat par raji hue hai ki kisi bhi bhavi aatanki hamale ko lekar real time data saajha kiya jayega
 Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information about threats in Balochistan and other areas
 bharat ke pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne kaha tha ki mumbai hamalon ke gunaahagaaron ko sazaa dene kii zarurat he
 BJP leader in Lok Sabha Yashwant Sinha had said that i want to tell the Prime Minister that what has happened in Sharm el-sheikh, if we try to wash that shame by collecting the seven sea water, it is not going to wash away the shame
 bijepi us vakt kaaphi aakraamak thi ki saajha bayaan main baluchistan kaa zikr sweekaar kar bharat ne pakistan ke aarope ko sweekaar kar liya he ki vahaan ugravad bhadakaane main bharat kii bhoomika he
 India's foreign policy has been declared that India does not interfere in the internal affairs of any country
 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar banane se pehle 2014 ke apane ek bhaashan main ajit dobhaal ne kaha tha, 'rakshaatmak rukh apnaane ke dauraan agar aap par 100 pathar phenke jate hai or aap 90 roak lete hai to bhi 10 pathar aapako nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 In such a situation you can never win
 kyonki yaa to aap haar jate hai yaa phir yathasthiti bani rahati he
 If you change the defensive strategy and adopt a defensive offensive approach, then they will find that they cannot afford it for long
 aap ek or mumbai karenge to aap baluchistan kho denge
 ' kya bharat sarkaar ajit dobhaal sahab kii soch yaa niti par aage bad rahi he
 India has made military intervention in the case of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, now questions are being raised about what India will do publicly after this statement
 kya pradhanmantri modi duniya ke manchon par kahenge ki baluchistan main bharat kii bhoomika thi yaa ab hogi? kya baluchistan main maanavadhikaar kii raksha ke liye bharat srilanka kii tarah sainya hastkshep karegaa? kya bharat baluchistan ko lekar sanyukt raashtra ke kisi manch par uthayega? kya bharat ji-20 jaise manchon par kisi prakaar ke aarthik pratibandh kii baat karegaa? Is India's strategy for human rights limited to Pakistan only or Tibetan people can expect something from India against China, people of Indian origin living in Nepal can also expect something from India after the new constitution is implemented 
 bharat pakistan ke bich kii niti videsh niti se kam gharelu niti se zyada chalati he
 But the ties which were intensifying with the arrival of Nawaz Sharif at the swearing-in, Nawaz Sharif presented a sari to Prime Minister Modi's mother, Modi ji gifted Nawaz Sharif's mother a shawl and Vajpayee's poem
 nawaz shareef ke janmdin par lahore jaakar pradhanmantri modi ne sabko chaunkaa diya
 We were told that a new history is being created which is out of the box
 us khushrahmi main pathankot airbase par hue hamale par bhi sabar kar gaye
 From where the terrorists came, the investigation team was also allowed to come so that they could visit the affected areas of the airbase
 kya ye sab tasviren blike and white ke jamaane vaale album main samaa jaaengi
 Has India now decided to dump that history into the dustbin? jo log itihaas ke vidhyaarthee nahin rahe hai unhen main vidhyaarthee hone ke naate ek baat bataa saktaa hum
 History requires patience
 itihaas banane main bhi, itihaas likhane main bhi or itihaas padhane main bhi
 It is not easy to write new by ridding the old history
 isliye bharat or pakistan ab un pannon par phir se waapas pahunch gaye hai jahaan ve donon khush nazar aate hai
 Both have reached their respective pitches
 khud hi gend phenk rahe hai khud hi chakka maar rahe hai
 The comments dilli sthit pakistan duutavas main rajdoot abdul basit ne apane mulk kii azaadi ko kashmir kii azaadi ke naam kar bharat ko chunauti de di
 Sartaj Aziz in Islamabad has said that Balochistan is an integral part of Pakistan
 modi ke bayaan ne pakistan kii baat ko sahi sabit kar diya he ki bharat apane khufia sanghathan ro ke zariye vahaan aatankwaad paidaa kar rahaa he
 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said that the world needs to pay attention to what kind of excesses are happening on innocent Kashmiris
 apni azaadi ke adhikaar ke liye kashmiri balidaan de rahe hai
 In November last year, Pakistan banned any of the interviews or statements of Hafiz Saeed, mastermind of the Mumbai attacks, from being shown on the channels
 mangalvaar ko yah roak hataa lee gai he
 The Indian Express quoted sources as saying
 pradhanmantri chaahate to isi aath agast ko baluchistan ke queta main hue aatanki hamale kaa zikr kar sakate the jisamen 70 log maare gaye, 120 log ghayal hue lekin laal qile se unhone 2014 main peshawar ke sainik skool main hue aatanki hamale kaa zikr kiya
 140 children and teachers were killed in that attack, towards which there was mourning in schools in India
 pradhanmantri ne yah bhi to kaha ki donon deshon ko milakar ladanaa hoga
 On one side there is talk of different front, on the other side there is talk of fighting together
 rahi baat maanavadhikaar kii to kya sanyukt raashtra sangh kaa praavdhaan is aadhaar par kisi desh ko kisi desh main ghusane kii anumati detaa he
 By the way, whatever the country wants, it has entered
 ukraine, yaman, syria, iraq
 Will it be a matter of talk instead of talk or is it somewhere that we are moving towards an aggressive war
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, 'jin logon ke vishay main meri kabhi mulaakaat nahin hui he, lekin aise dur sudur baithe hue log hindustan ke pradhanmantri ko abhinandan karte hai, to wo mere sava sau karod desh vaasiyon kaa sammaan he or isliye ye sammaan kaa bhav, ye dhanyavad kaa bhav karne vaale baluchistan ke logon kaa, gilgit ke logon kaa, paak ke kabze vaale kashmir ke logon kaa main aaj tahe dil se aabhaar vyakt karnaa chahta hum
 ' kya is aabhaar ko bharat kaa sakriy samarthan samajha ja saktaa he
 After the all-party meeting on 12 August, there is an organization called the us-based Gilgit Baltistan National Congress, which thanked the Prime Minister of India for taking up the matter of human rights abuses and Baloch leader Brahmadagh Baguti has also welcomed the Prime Minister
 kya bharat ke liye in sanghathanon kii itani ahmiyat he ki pradhanmantri ne laal qila se sarvadaleey baithak kii jagah inke aabhaar ke prati aabhaar vyakt kiya
 What we call Pakistan Occupied Kashmir is divided into two parts in Pakistan
 azaad kashmir or doosraa gilgit blatistan
 India's 106 km border lies in Afghanistan, which falls in Pakistan occupied Kashmir
 may maheene main bharat ke rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar ajit dowal ne biguef ke afasaron se kaha tha ki hamen is 106 kimi kii seemaa ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana hoga jo afghanistan se lagati he
 a part of Gilgit Baltistan is from China
 yah behad kuubasurat ilaaka he
 K-2 is the world's second highest peak here
 22 farvari 1994 main narsinha raav sarkaar ke samay sansad ne ek prastaav paas kiya tha jisamen kaha gaya tha ki badhati aatanki hinsa or kashmir vivaad ko uthaane kii pakistan kii koshishon ke maddenzar bhartiya sansad ke donon sadanon ne ek mat se 22 farvari 1994 ko ek prastaav paas kiya jisamen is baat par jor diya gaya ki jammu-kashmir bharat kaa abhinn ang he or pakistan ko apane kabze vaale kashmir ke ilaakon ko khaali kar dena chahie
 In October 2015, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj at the United Nations said that if the pok is in the possession of foreign powers, then that foreign power is Pakistan
 isi saal do baar yani janvari or june maheene main videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa vikaas swaroop ne bhi kaha tha ki jammu kashmir kaa puraa rajya jisamen gilgit blatistan kaa kshetra bhi aata he, wo bharat kaa abhinn ang he
 There is a lot of excitement about Balochistan
 baluchistan pakistan ke chaar prashasnic praanton main se ek he
 Apart from this, there are three other provinces, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtoon Khwah and Sindh
 baluchistan kaa ilaaka afghanistan or iran se laga he
 Pakistan is the largest province but the population is very less
 baluchistan khanij padaarthon se las hokar bhi garib he
 Movements of different factions are going on here regarding Baloch nationality
 is ilaake kii raajnneeti jaanane vaale kehete hai ki balooch logon par pakistan ne beintahaa zulm dhaae hai
 Pakistan considers their movement as extremism
 kai balooch netaa alag alag deshon main rah rahe hai
 Gwadar port is in Balochistan which is being built by China
 isi ke jawaab main bharat ne iran main chabahaar bandargah banane kaa kaam apane jimme liya he
 Even in the year of 2009, there has been a ruckus in India's politics regarding Balochistan
 us saal 16 july ke rose ejipt ke shame al shaikh se bharat or pakistan ne ek saajha bayaan jari kar kaha tha ki donon desh sahamat hai ki aatankwaad se donon ko khatara he
 Both leaders have agreed that real-time data will be shared regarding any future terrorist attack
 pradhanmantri gilaani ne is baat kaa zikr kiya ki baluchistan or anya ilaakon main khataron ko lekar pakistan ke paas kuch suchnaae hai
 Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh said that the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks need to be punished
 loksabhaa main bijepi netaa yashamvat sinha ne kaha tha ki main pradhanmantri ji se kahana chahta hum ki jo shame al shaikh main hua he, saaton samudr kaa pani ikatta karke agar us shame ko dhone kaa prayaas humlog karenge to vah shame nahin dhulane vaali he
 The BJP was very aggressive at that time, by accepting the reference of Balochistan in a shared statement, India has accepted the charge of Pakistan that there is a role of India in instigating militancy there
 bharat kii videsh niti ghoshit taur par yahi rahi he ki bharat kisi mulk ke aatanrik maamalon main dakhal nahin detaa he
 In his 2014 speech before becoming National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval had said, 'even if you take a defensive stance, 100 stones are thrown at you and if you stop 90, even 10 stones harm you
 aise main aap kabhi jeet nahin sakate
 Because either you lose or the status quo remains
 agar aap rakshaatmak ranneeti ko badalakar rakshaatmak aakraamak rukh apana lete hai to unhen pataa lagegaa ki wo ise lambey samay tak nahin jhel sakate
 If you do another Mumbai then you will lose Baluchistan
 ' Is the Indian government moving forward on the thinking or policy of Ajit Doval Saheb
 bangladesh or srilanka ke maamle main bharat sainya hastkshep kar chukaa he ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki is bayaan ke baad bharat saarvajanik rup se kya karegaa
 Will Prime Minister Modi say on the world forums that India had a role in Balochistan or will it now? Will India intervene like Sri Lanka in military intervention to protect human rights in Balochistan? Will India take up any UN forum on Balochistan? Will India talk of any kind of economic ban on forums like G20? kya maanavadhikaar ko lekar bharat kii ranneeti sirf pakistan tak hi simit he yaa tibeti log bhi bharat se china ke kilaaf kuch ummid kar sakate hai, nepal main rahane vaale bhartiya mul ke log bhi nayaa samvidhan lagu hone ke baad bharat se kuch ummid kar sakate hai
 The policy between India and Pakistan runs more than domestic policy less than foreign policy
 lekin jo sambandh shapath grahan main nawaz shareef ke aane se pragadh ho rahe the, nawaz shareef ne pradhanmantri modi kii maa ko sari bhent kii, modi ji ne bhi nawaz shareef kii maa ko shawl or vaajapeyi kii kavita gift kar di
 Prime Minister Modi surprised everyone by visiting Lahore on the birthday of Nawaz Sharif
 hamen bataaya gaya ki ek nayaa itihaas ban rahaa he jo li se hat kar he
 Pathankot was also patient with the attack on the airbase
 jahaan se aatanki aae vahiin se jaanch dal ko bhi aane diya gaya taaki airbase ke prabhavit ilaakon kaa daura kar sake
 Will all these pictures be included in the black and white era album
 kya bharat ne us itihaas ko ab koodaydaan main daalane kaa faisla kar liya he
 To those who have not been students of history, i can tell them one thing as a student
 itihaas ko lekar sabar kii zarurat hoti he
 Even in making history, in writing history and also in reading history
 puraane itihaas se moh chhudaakar nayaa likhnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 So India and Pakistan have now returned to those pages where they both seem happy
 donon apane apane pich par pahunch gaye hai
 He is throwing the ball himself and hitting himself for a six
 tippaniyan Ambassador Abdul Basit challenged the independence of his country in the name of independence of Kashmir in the Pakistan Embassy in Delhi
 islamabad main sartaaj azeez ne kaha he ki baluchistan pakistan kaa abhinn ang hai
 Modi's statement has proved Pakistan's point that India is creating terrorism there through its intelligence organization RAW
 pradhanmantri nawaz sharif ne kaha he ki duniya ko is par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he ki nirdosh kashmiriyon par kis tarah kii zyadatiyaan ho rahi hai
 Kashmiris are sacrificing for their right to freedom
 pichley saal november main pakistan ne mumbai hamalon ke master mind hafiz said ke kisi bhi itanravyuu yaa bayaan ko channelon par dikhaane se roak laga di thi
 This restriction has been lifted on Tuesday
 indian express ne sutron ke hawaale se likhaa he
 If the Prime Minister wanted, he could have referred to the terrorist attack in Quetta, Balochistan on August 8, in which 70 people were killed, 120 people were injured, but from the Red Fort, he referred to the terrorist attack in the military school of Peshawar in 2014
 us hamale main 140 bachche or teacher maare gaye the jinke prati bharat ke skulon main shok manaaya gaya tha

 If the Prime Minister wanted, he could have referred to the terrorist attack in Quetta, Balochistan on August 8, in which 70 people were killed, 120 people were injured, but from the Red Fort, he referred to the terrorist attack in the military school of Peshawar in 2014
 us hamale main 140 bachche or teacher maare gaye the jinke prati bharat ke skulon main shok manaaya gaya tha
 The Prime Minister also said that the two countries have to fight together
 ek taraf alag alag morche kii baat ho rahi he, duusari taraf ek milakar ladane kii baat ho rahi he
 It is a matter of human rights that the provision of the United Nations allows a country to enter a country on this basis
 vaise jo desh chahta he wo ghusaa hi hua he
 Ukraine, Yemen, Syria, Iraq
 kya ab baatcheet kii jagah baton kii baat hogi yaa kahin aisa to nahin ki ham kisi aakraamak yani yuddh kii taraf bad rahe hai
 Even in the year of 2009, there has been a ruckus in India's politics regarding Balochistan
 us saal 16 july ke rose ejipt ke shame al shaikh se bharat or pakistan ne ek saajha bayaan jari kar kaha tha ki donon desh sahamat hai ki aatankwaad se donon ko khatara he
 Both leaders have agreed that real-time data will be shared regarding any future terrorist attack
 pradhanmantri gilaani ne is baat kaa zikr kiya ki baluchistan or anya ilaakon main khataron ko lekar pakistan ke paas kuch suchnaae hai
 Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh said that the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks need to be punished
 loksabhaa main bijepi netaa yashamvat sinha ne kaha tha ki main pradhanmantri ji se kahana chahta hum ki jo shame al shaikh main hua he, saaton samudr kaa pani ikatta karke agar us shame ko dhone kaa prayaas humlog karenge to vah shame nahin dhulane vaali he
 The BJP was very aggressive at that time, by accepting the reference of Balochistan in a shared statement, India has accepted the charge of Pakistan that there is a role of India in instigating militancy there
 bharat kii videsh niti ghoshit taur par yahi rahi he ki bharat kisi mulk ke aatanrik maamalon main dakhal nahin detaa he
 In his 2014 speech before becoming National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval had said, 'even if you take a defensive stance, 100 stones are thrown at you and if you stop 90, even 10 stones harm you
 aise main aap kabhi jeet nahin sakate
 Because either you lose or the status quo remains
 agar aap rakshaatmak ranneeti ko badalakar rakshaatmak aakraamak rukh apana lete hai to unhen pataa lagegaa ki wo ise lambey samay tak nahin jhel sakate
 If you do another Mumbai then you will lose Baluchistan
 ' Is the Indian government moving forward on the thinking or policy of Ajit Doval Saheb
 bangladesh or srilanka ke maamle main bharat sainya hastkshep kar chukaa he ab sawaal uth rahe hai ki is bayaan ke baad bharat saarvajanik rup se kya karegaa
 Will Prime Minister Modi say on the world forums that India had a role in Balochistan or will it now? Will India intervene like Sri Lanka in military intervention to protect human rights in Balochistan? Will India take up any UN forum on Balochistan? Will India talk of any kind of economic ban on forums like G20? kya maanavadhikaar ko lekar bharat kii ranneeti sirf pakistan tak hi simit he yaa tibeti log bhi bharat se china ke kilaaf kuch ummid kar sakate hai, nepal main rahane vaale bhartiya mul ke log bhi nayaa samvidhan lagu hone ke baad bharat se kuch ummid kar sakate hai
 The policy between India and Pakistan runs more than domestic policy less than foreign policy
 lekin jo sambandh shapath grahan main nawaz shareef ke aane se pragadh ho rahe the, nawaz shareef ne pradhanmantri modi kii maa ko sari bhent kii, modi ji ne bhi nawaz shareef kii maa ko shawl or vaajapeyi kii kavita gift kar di
 Prime Minister Modi surprised everyone by visiting Lahore on the birthday of Nawaz Sharif
 hamen bataaya gaya ki ek nayaa itihaas ban rahaa he jo li se hat kar he
 Pathankot was also patient with the attack on the airbase
 jahaan se aatanki aae vahiin se jaanch dal ko bhi aane diya gaya taaki airbase ke prabhavit ilaakon kaa daura kar sake
 Will all these pictures be included in the black and white era album
 kya bharat ne us itihaas ko ab koodaydaan main daalane kaa faisla kar liya he
 To those who have not been students of history, i can tell them one thing as a student
 itihaas ko lekar sabar kii zarurat hoti he
 Even in making history, in writing history and also in reading history
 puraane itihaas se moh chhudaakar nayaa likhnaa aasaan nahin hota he
 So India and Pakistan have now returned to those pages where they both seem happy
 donon apane apane pich par pahunch gaye hai
 He is throwing the ball himself and hitting himself for a six
 tippaniyan Ambassador Abdul Basit challenged the independence of his country in the name of independence of Kashmir in the Pakistan Embassy in Delhi
 islamabad main sartaaj azeez ne kaha he ki baluchistan pakistan kaa abhinn ang hai
 Modi's statement has proved Pakistan's point that India is creating terrorism there through its intelligence organization RAW
 pradhanmantri nawaz sharif ne kaha he ki duniya ko is par dhyaan dene kii zarurat he ki nirdosh kashmiriyon par kis tarah kii zyadatiyaan ho rahi hai
 Kashmiris are sacrificing for their right to freedom

 BJP leader in Lok Sabha Yashwant Sinha had said that i want to tell the Prime Minister that what has happened in Sharm el-sheikh, if we try to wash that shame by collecting the seven sea water, it is not going to wash away the shame
 bijepi us vakt kaaphi aakraamak thi ki saajha bayaan main baluchistan kaa zikr sweekaar kar bharat ne pakistan ke aarope ko sweekaar kar liya he ki vahaan ugravad bhadakaane main bharat kii bhoomika he
 India's foreign policy has been declared that India does not interfere in the internal affairs of any country
 rashtriya suraksha salaahkaar banane se pehle 2014 ke apane ek bhaashan main ajit dobhaal ne kaha tha, 'rakshaatmak rukh apnaane ke dauraan agar aap par 100 pathar phenke jate hai or aap 90 roak lete hai to bhi 10 pathar aapako nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 In such a situation you can never win
 kyonki yaa to aap haar jate hai yaa phir yathasthiti bani rahati he
 If you change the defensive strategy and adopt a defensive offensive approach, then they will find that they cannot afford it for long
 aap ek or mumbai karenge to aap baluchistan kho denge
 ' kya bharat sarkaar ajit dobhaal sahab kii soch yaa niti par aage bad rahi he
 India has made military intervention in the case of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, now questions are being raised about what India will do publicly after this statement
 kya pradhanmantri modi duniya ke manchon par kahenge ki baluchistan main bharat kii bhoomika thi yaa ab hogi? kya baluchistan main maanavadhikaar kii raksha ke liye bharat srilanka kii tarah sainya hastkshep karegaa? kya bharat baluchistan ko lekar sanyukt raashtra ke kisi manch par uthayega? kya bharat ji-20 jaise manchon par kisi prakaar ke aarthik pratibandh kii baat karegaa? Is India's strategy for human rights limited to Pakistan only or Tibetan people can expect something from India against China, people of Indian origin living in Nepal can also expect something from India after the new constitution is implemented

 Has India now decided to dump that history into the dustbin? jo log itihaas ke vidhyaarthee nahin rahe hai unhen main vidhyaarthee hone ke naate ek baat bataa saktaa hum
 History requires patience
 itihaas banane main bhi, itihaas likhane main bhi or itihaas padhane main bhi
 It is not easy to write new by ridding the old history

 pichley kai saalon main yah pehla mauka he jab congress party ne uttar pradesh kii iftaar party ko radd kar diya, vah bhi bina koi kaaran bataae
 The party issued a press release saying that it would not be an Iftar party due to unavoidable reasons
 lakhanu ke hotel clark main 22 june ko iftaar party rakhi gai thi, lekin 20 june kii shaam ko hi ise chupchaap cancil kar diya gaya
 Now there is a lot of talk about the cancellation of this iftar party of UP Congress from within the party to Muslim ulema
 party ke bheetar bhi jitne munh utani baaten ho rahi hai
 According to some leaders, the party did not want to do it in the hotel, but wanted to have an iftar party in the slum
 isi vajah se ise cancil kiya gaya
 At the same time, some party spokespersons are saying that the Iftar party has been canceled due to the busy schedule of Ghulam Nabi Azad and Raj Babbar in the presidential election
 bataa den ki pradesh adhyakshraj babbar kii taraf sekarib 500 logon ko iftaar ke daavat kaa nimantran bheja ja chukaa tha, hotel clark kaa maidan book kiya ja chukaa tha or party ke liye menu bhi taiyaar tha, lekin bina kisi vajah ke iftaar ke radd kiye jane kii asli vajah koi nahin bataa paa rahaa
 There is also discussion that the party wants to avoid looking more pro-muslim
 congress party to is maamle main sanbhalkar bol rahi he, lekinmuslim ulimaon neis tareeke se aftaar party ko radd karne par ungali jarur uthaai he
 Firangi Mahli and Yasub Abbas said that whether or not to give an Iftar party is one's own right but should not have been canceled by inviting

 The legendary Mohammed Shahid, who made a mark in the hockey world with his dribbling art in the 80s, was considered one of the greatest players of all time
 varanasi ke rahane vaale shahid ne sattar ke dashak ke aakhir main or 80 ke dashak kii shuruyaat main apni stick kii jaaduugari se duniya bhar ko mureed banaaya
 He had the ability to penetrate the world's best defense
 virdohi timen jahanmaidan par unase khauf khaati thi, vahiin maidan ke baahar vah behad vinamr or mridubhashi the jo hameshaa saathi khilaadiyon kii madad ko tatpar rahete
 Born on 14 April 1960 in Varanasi, Mohammad Shahid made his international debut in 1979 through the Junior World Cup against France at the age of 19
 vah 1980 main senior team main aae jab vasudevan bhaskaran kii captaini main bharat ne kualalampur main chaar deshon kaa toornament khelaa
 The aggressive duo of Shahid Shahid and Zafar Iqbal used to play aggressive hockey at that time
 ikbaal ne unke nidhan ke baad kaha, ‘unke jaisaa khilaadi maine apane jivan main nahin dekha
 Our rapport on the field was fantastic
 uski kami khalegi
 Shahid received the Best Forward at the Champions Trophy in Karachi in 1980
 vah masco olympic 1980 main aathvaan or aakhri gold medal jeetne vaali bhartiya team ke sadsy the
 In addition, he won silver at the 1982 Delhi Asian Games and bronze in 1986
 vah 1986 kii ol star asian team ke bhi sadsy rahe
 Shahid was a part of the Indian team that had such distinctions as Zafar Iqbal, Mervyn Fernandes, Charanjit Kumar, MM Somaiya, Surinder Singh Sodhi and MK Kaushik but made a different identity
 1980-81 main arjul puraskaar or 1986 main padmashri se nawaja gaya
 Why hockey lost its shine? Shahid was a staunch opponent of foreign coaches and recently wrote in his column in a Hindi sports magazine that the pride of Indian hockey is being lost due to being a slave to strategies
 unhone likhaa tha, ‘yadi ye videshi coach itane hi achche hai to apane desh ke coach kyon nahin he
 We are an eight-time Olympic champion and we are proud of it, but in the current situation we should not expect a medal in the Rio Olympics
 ’ varanasi main bhartiya railway main khel adhikari shahid ke aakhri kuch din medanta aspataal ke isiu main gujarey jahaan unhen pichley maheene bhartee karaayaa gaya tha
 Shahid, who struggled in and out of the field, also fought to the death till the last time, but lost this battle of life to disease

 Veteran tennis player Vijay Amritraj is shocked by the removal of his elder brother as the captain of India's Davis Cup team
 unhone kaha ki anand amritraj pichley teen dashak main desh ke sarvshereshth captain the or jitate hue captain ko hataanaa prachlan ke khilaaf he
 Vijay, who was also India's captain in the Davis Cup, said Anand was very committed and no one could question his results
 do baar vimbledon or america open ke ekal quarter final main pahunchane vaale vijay ne kaha ‘main prayek cheez kii jatilta par dhyaan nahin detaa lekin mujhe pataa he ki 1987-88 se anand se behatar koi captain nahin he
 "he said" i am not just saying that he is my brother but because i am hardly any Indian player of the past who has played Davis Cup at the top level for 20 years and all the Grand Slam singles Played in saath hi kuch sheersh khilaadiyon ko haraaya bhi ho or khel ke liye junun barkaar ho
 a player who regularly pays attention to Futures, Challenger and ATP 250 competition
 ’ When Vijay was told that AITA did not question the results but removed them for failing to maintain discipline in the team, he said, "I don't know of any other issues
" main vahi dekhtaa hum jo maine samachar patron main padhaa isliye mere najariye se anand shandaar captain tha
 ' anand antim baar bhartiya team kii aguwai pune main karenge jab agle maheene bharat, newjiland kii mejabani karegaa or iske baad april se team kii kaman mahesh bhupati ke haathon main hogi
 Vijay said, 'another question is whether Mahesh Bhupathi qualifies as captain, of course
 isamen koi sawaal nahin he
 He has been there and given the results
 lekin aam taur par aap vijayi captain ko barkaraar rakhte ho or mere najariye se nishchit taur par vah aglaa captain hota
 Vijay said that Anand gave results despite the absence of a single player in the top 100
 tippaniyan He said, 'it is not easy to make a place in the play-offs in today's situation

 Also beat some of the top players and show passion for the game
 aisa khilaadi jo niyamit taur par futures, chalanger or atipi 250 pratiyogita par dhyaan detaa ho

 ' Anand will lead the Indian team for the final time in Pune when India host New Zealand next month and from April onwards the team will be led by Mahesh Bhupathi

 This is the story of Suhayb Ilyasi, host of the crime show India's Most Wanted
 jinhen hai court ne shuukravaar ko badi raahat dete hue bari kar diya
 Suhaib Ilyasi's wife Anju Ilyasi died in mysterious condition 18 years ago
 17 saal baad yani 20 disambar 2017 ko dilli kii nichali adaalat ne anju kii maut ke liye suhaib eliyasi ko doshi qaraar de dete hue umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 He was also fined ten lakh rupees
 lekin suhaib us faisle ke khilaaf hai court chale gaye the
 In which he was acquitted of the charge of killing his wife after hearing
 jaise suhaib india ke most wonted aparaadhiyon kii pahchaan bataate the, waisi hi pahchaan khud unki ban gai thi
 Who would have thought that the person who once used to get people to deal with the most wanted criminals through his TV show
 90 ke dashak main jis awaz ko sunate hi aparaadhiyon ke haath-pair kaanpane lagate the
 Who made the criminals sleep
 khud uskaa naam ek din unheen aparaadhiyon kii fehrist main jud jayega
 Those born in the 21st century may not know this person very well, but for those born before that, this person is not an idiot
 raat main tivi par jaise hi uske krime sho kii dhun bajati thi, log samaj jate the ki aaj phir kisi gangster kii shamat aane vaali he
 But the wheel of time turned so that the person who led the culprits to their real place, he himself reached behind bars
 wo bhi apni hi bivi anju eliyasi ke katl ke ilzaam main
 But 17 years later, Delhi's Karkardooma court convicted Suhaib Ilyasi, the anchor of the crime showindia's Most Wanted, for the death of his own wife
 anju eliyasi kii hatya ke is cese main aae twists, kisi filmi kahani se kam nahin
 This was the whole affair, the story started in the year 2000
 taarikh thi 10 janvari
 Suhayb's wife Anju Ilyasi was rushed to the hospital in an injured condition from a house in Mayur Vihar area in east Delhi
 police ko die bayaan main suhaib ne bataaya ki donon ke bich hui kahasuni ke baad anju ne khudakushi karne ke iraade se khud ko chaaku maar liya
 At the time of the incident, apart from Anju Ilyasi, his two and a half year old daughter Alia and Suhaib Ilyasi were present in the house
 suhaib ke mutabik jab wo ghar pahunchaa tab anju se uski kuch kahasuni hui
 After which Anju went to another room and then angrily stabbed herself
 anju ke pet par chaaku ke do nishaan the
 Anju Ilyasi later died while undergoing treatment at the hospital
 ab sara maamaal is baat par aakar thahar gaya tha ki kya sachmuch anju ne khudakushi kii yaa phir uskaa katl kiya gaya? ye sawaal isliye uth rahaa tha ki export is baat ko maanane ko taiyaar hi nahin the ki khudakushi karne vaala koi insaan khud par chaaku se ek se zyaada baar waar kar saktaa he
 Later postmortem report also failed to answer this question
 teen doctoron ke panel ne anju eliyasi kii laash kaa postmortem kiya
 Two-two atopy reports were prepared
 ferensik jaanch ke nattejey aae
 The statements of Anju's parents were recorded
 tab sab yahi ishaara kar rahe the ki anju ne khudakushi kii hi he
 The police was also going to complete the investigation on this theory
 10 janvari 2000 kii us raat anju nesuhayb eliasike saath jhagade ke baad khud ko chaaku maaraa yaa use kisi or ne chaaku mara? postmortem report cese par koi khaas roshni nahin daal paa rahi thi or chaaku par na anju kii ungaliyon ke nishaan mil rahe the, na hi suhaib eliyasi ke
 Apart from this, there was no eyewitness in the house
 lihaaza shuru main vahi kahani sab maan rahe the, jo suhaib suna rahaa tha
 But then the twist came when Anju's elder sister Rashmi came to India from Canada in February, a month after Anju's murder
 rashmi ne pehali baar ye khulaasa kar sabhi ko chaunkaa diya ki anju ne khudakushi nahin kii he balki uskaa katl hua he
 After that the wheel of time turned and the needle of suspicion stopped on Suhayb
 bas vahiin se suhaib kii pareshaani kii safar shuru ho chukaa tha
 The case reached the court via police
 17 saal baad 20 disambar 2017 ko dilli kii kadakadduma court ne suhaib ko doshi maanate hue umrakaid kii sajaa sunai thi
 But now the Delhi High Court, while giving a big verdict, acquitted Suhaib from the charge of killing his wife
 hai court ne kaha ki is maamle main suhaib ke khilaaf koi saboot nahin he

 The Japan Meteorological Agency reported that a 20-cm-high tsunami was observed in Ishinomaki, Miyagi area at 5:15 am local time (1:42 pm IST)
 agency ne miyagi kshetra or paas ke phukushima parmaanu sanyantr tathaa evet kshetron ke liye tsunami se sambandhit paraamarsh jari kiya tha
 It warned that waves up to a meter high in these areas after the earthquake could affect the Pacific coastlines

 "we have not seen any damage or change in radiation amplifiers after the earthquake," said Masahiro Asaoka, a spokesman for Tepco

 Why? The answer lies with Nietzsche who used to say, "I am not bothered that you lied to me
" meri dikkat yah he ki ab main tum par bharosa nahin kar saktaa
 Nietzsche's statement applies to the market 100 percent and not even one percent on politics
 nitshe se lekar aaj tak sach-jhooth kaa, jo nijee or samuhik manovigyaan viksit hua he uske tahat jhooth hi siyasat kii pahchaan hai
 Nobody trusts a false market
 bazaar ko tape hue khare vishwaas par chalanaa hota he
 Before the greetings of social networks like Facebook, whatsapp, Twitter, people all over the world were aware of the fact that politics is great
 vah vichaar, prachaar, vyavhaar, bhaavana main lapet kar jhooth hi bhejegi lekin bazaar ko hameshaa yah pataa rahanaa chahie ki jhooth kaa kaarobaar nahin ho saktaa he
 It is impossible to cheat people again and again
 companiyaan apane utpaada waapas leti hai, maafee maangati hai, mukademe jhelti hai, sajaa bhogati hai, yahaan tak ki bazaar se bhaga di jaati hai kyonki log jhooth main nivesh nahin karte
 On the other hand, politics has always been a big and dangerous lie, which is tolerated like mandatory evils
 jhooth hameshaa se tha lekin achaanak takanic companiyaan rashan-pani lekar jhooth se ladgaye kyon nikal padi hai? isliye kyonki raajnneeti kaa chirantan jhooth ek nae bazaar par vishwaas ke liye khatra he
 The best of social network democracy
 abhivyakti hai
 Equipped with the power of technology, this democracy emerged in the nineties with economic freedom and glamorous movement
 dotarafa samvaad bolne kii aazaadee kaa charam par he jo in networkon ke jariye hasil ho gai
 Desperate question-and-answer, denial-agreement, freedom of thinking in the group, and the most connected way, that is, democracy of expression! This is the business model of Facebook, Twitter, whatsapp
 isi ke jariye soshal network or miseging ap arabon kaa kaarobaar karne lage
 The intrusion of political lies has shaken confidence in this business
 agar yah network, kutil netaaon se logon kii aazaadee nahin bachaa sake to inke paas aayega koun?jhooth se ladaai main soshal network ko shuruaati taur par kaarobaari nuksaan hoga
 They not only have to invest heavily in changing technology, algotarism (the brain of computers), creating lie-finding robots but also changing the way of attracting advertisements
 soshal networkon par vigyaapan, prayogkartaaon kii ruchi, vyavhaar, rajnatik jhukaav, aadaton par aadhaarit hote hai
 This reinforces the spread of lies
 isamen badlaav se companiyon kii kamai ghategi
 Still, it is no surprise that social networks limit or discontinue political advertisements in order to maintain confidence in themselves, or ban the use of networks for political views
 The politics that it touches becomes tainted
 abhivyakti ke is navdith bazaar kii saakh par ban ai he isliye yah apni puri shakti ke saath apane rajnatik istemaal ke khilaaf khadaa ho rahaa he
 The technique is fundamentally value neutral
 lekin rasayan or parmaanu takneekon ke istemaal ke niyam tay kiye gaye taaki koi sirphira netaa inhen logon par istemaal na kar le
 Social networking will be the next technology whose market will decide the rules for its use
 bazaar siyasat ke jhooth ko chunauti dene vaala he!raajnneeti ke liye yah buree khabar he
 Bad news for politics is good for freedom

 centre sarkaar ne kaha he ki herald house ko akhbaar laane ke liye diya gaya tha jabaki herald house main 2008 main hi akhbaar kaa prakaashan band kar diya gaya or vahaan ke staff ko walentary ritairement dekar nikaal diya gaya
 In such a situation when there is no work of publication there, the government had to cancel the lease to prevent misuse of the place

 maharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye siton ke bantwaare ko lekar pichley kai dinon se bane gatirodh ke baad bhaajapa or shivasena kaa 25 saal purana gathbandhan aakhir guuruuvaar ko tut gaya
 Maharashtra BJP President Devendra Fadnavis announced this in Mumbai, saying, 'we have informed the Shiv Sena about our decision
 ' fadanvis ne is nirnay ke liye siton ke bantwaare ke maamle main shivasena ke 'adial' ravaiye ko jimmedaar tehraaya
 He said, 'mahayuti (alliance in Maharashtra) will contest elections without Shiv Sena and we will not criticize Shiv Sena during election campaign
 ham mitra bane rahenge
 Earlier, a meeting of the leaders of both parties was held this evening as a last-ditch effort to save the 25-year-old bjp-shiv Sena alliance in Maharashtra, but bjp's negotiator Fadnavis, owing to the Shiv Sena's 'stubborn' stand And Vinod Tawde, the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, got up from the middle of the meeting
 is par shivasena ke netaaon ne bhaajapa par aarope lagaaya ki vah 'sambandh todane kii jaldi main he'
 Elections to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly are to be held on October 15 and only two days remain on the last date for filing nomination papers
 fadanvis or tavade ne kaha ki shivasena ne jo prastaav rakhaa he vah gathbandhan ke anuroop nahin tha
 Fadnavis came out of the meeting and told reporters, 'we received several proposals from the Shiv Sena but none of them were going to contain the BJP or other allies
 ' Describing the break-up of the alliance as unfortunate, BJP general secretary and Maharashtra in-charge Rajeev Pratap Rudy said that time constraints and the stubborn attitude of the Shiv Sena forced the party to decide to go alone in the elections
 unhone kaha, 'yah bahut durbhagyapurna he ki hamen 25 vashren ke safar ke baad alag hona padaa
 We have seen many ups and downs with the Shiv Sena in the last 25 years and we faced them with bravery
 ' Rudy said that if there was more time left for nomination then the negotiations for a friendly solution would have proceeded, but were forced to break away from time constraints and the stubborn attitude of the Shiv Sena
 unhone kaha, 'na chaahate hue hamen alag hona padaa kyonki samay sambandhi baadha thi
 Nomination for all 288 seats has to be done by the deadline of September 27, which has been decided by the Election Commission
 ' Rudy said, 'we are committed to this that if we are separating, then we will not have any bitterness with our old partner and the main basis of this election will be to liberate the state from the ncp-congress rule which has given years Till have done misrule and corruption
 ' On the other hand Shiv Sena leaders Diwakar Raute and Rajya Sabha member Anil Desai, sent by Thackeray for talks with BJP leaders, said, 'BJP was in a hurry to end the relationship
 ' route ne kaha, 'ham uddhav thakare dwaara bheje gaye antim prastaav par charchaa ke liye aae the
 There were differences over only a few seats, but they left the meeting without informing us
 ' Raut, looking angry, said, 'we too will give a befitting reply through Uddhavji to this behavior of the BJP
 ' khabaron ke anusaar ek prastaav main 288 sadasyeey vidhansabha kii 151 siton par shivasena or 127 siton par bhaajapa ke ladane kaa suzav diya gaya tha
 The remaining 10 seats were proposed to be given to other smaller parties of the coalition
 lekin bhaajapa ne ise asweekaar kar diya
 After the unsuccessful final meeting, BJP state leaders Fadnavis and Eknath Khadse formally announced a breakdown of alliance with the Shiv Sena at a press conference
 bhaajapa netaaon ne kaha ki vah mahayuti ke chote dalon kaa saath nahin chhodeygi
 He blamed the Shiv Sena for breaking the alliance, alleging that Uddhav Thackeray's party did not show any flexibility in seat sharing
 khadse ne kaha ki baatcheet ke dauraan shivasena mukhyamantri pad ko lekar adi rahi
 The Shiv Sena, however, denied the bjp's charge of contesting for the chief minister's post
 party ke saansad aanandarav adsul ne bhaajapa par aarope lagaaya ki usne ensipi se andarkhaane main gupt samjhauta kar liya he
 Despite the break-up of the alliance, the BJP hoped that there would be a sense of friendship with the Shiv Sena
 khadse ne kaha, ‘‘ham chunaav prachaar ke dauraan shivasena ke viruddh koi tippanee nahin karenge or ummid he ki shivasena bhi aisa hi karegi

 Even in the meeting, there was no consensus among the leaders on this issue
 gulam nabi aaazaad kaaphi samay tak kashmir par bolte rahe
 On the other hand, other leaders, including Jyotiraditya Scindia, who supported this decision of the Modi government, appeared on the backfoot
 party kii purv adhyaksh sonia gandhi, rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi ne anuchhed 370 hataane ke tareeke kaa virodh kiya
 Also avoided speaking directly on 370
 yah bhi najar aayaa ki rajyasabha main sidhaa virodh karne ke baad party ne pehle loksabhaa main line badali or phir CWC main bhi yah dekhne ko mila
 a paragraph was added to the motion to satisfy Scindia and other leaders who supported the central government's decision
 iske baad hi yah prastaav sarvasammati se paas hua
 10 big things about the meeting - 1- In the CWC meeting, Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke on Kashmir for 45 minutes
 2- jitin prasad ne kaha ki desh kaa maahaul is mudde par bijepi ke paksh main he
 Jitin was free from the target, due to which Jitin said that the favor of some people is getting support in Kashmir
 is par chidambaram ne kaha ki aap kerala or tamilnadu ke bare main aisa nahin kah sakate
 In response, Jitin said that i come from Uttar Pradesh, there is this feeling
 3- centre ke faisle ke paksh main twit karne vaale jyotiraditya sindhiya akele pad gaye
 He said that i tweeted what the public sentiment is saying
 haalanki sarkaar ke tareeke se asahmat hum
 Scindia's talk received no support from anyone, including the Gandhi family
 4- deependra huda bhi apane twit kaa bachaav karte dikhe
 Hooda clarified that even after Pulwama, i said the same and then tweeted freshly, but also wrote that the way of government is not right
 5- arpyen singh ne kaha- aap kashmir par takneekee rup se sahi ho sakate hai, lekin janata ke bich kya lekar aae? kya jawaab den? takneekee pahalu nahin siyaasi pahalu saamne aaen, jinhen lekar ham janata ke bich jaaen
 6
 After listening to all, Rahul Gandhi said that we are with the truth, but public sentiment cannot be the only measure
 7- chidambaram ne kaha ki agar kal janabhaavana ke anuroop tamilnadu main hindi anivaary kar den to? kya aisa kar sakate hai? kya puraane vaade bhul sakate hai?8- priyanka ne bhi rahul kii haa main haa milaai or kaha ki sarkaar ne is masale par loktantr kaa majaak banaaya
 Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka looked united on this issue
 9- CWC ke prastaav main POK par alag se paragraph joda gaya
 This was due to the talk of Scindia, Kuldeep Vishnoi, Deepender Hooda, RPN Singh and Jitin Prasad
 prastaav main saaf kiya gaya ki kashmir hi nahin, pok bhi hamaara he
 It is a bilateral issue and no third arbitration is allowed
 10- aakhir main nehru, patel, ambedkar ne 370 kyon lagu kiya? is par bhi charchaa hui, lekin 370 hataane ke masale par khamoshi akhriyaar kar sarkaar ke tareeke se asahmati jataate hue prastaav paarit kiya gaya

 jab imran se poocha gaya ki unki film ke saath hi mahendra singhdhoni kii byopikabhi relies hogi to unhone kaha, 'mujhe dhoni kii byopic ke bare main kuch bhi nahin pataa, main sirf ajaharuddin kii aatmakatha ke bare main jaanata hum'ab yaa to imran hashmi jaan-boojh kar sachai chupa rahe hai yaa phirbox officepar pichhali filmon ke flop hone ke kaaran aisa ravaiya he
 One thing is revealed by Dhoni's lack of a biopic that maybe Imran has been paying more attention to his characters for a few years but the audience is not able to understand his feeling

 Our industry is like this
 ham bhi virodh pradarshan kar sakate hai, lekin hamaari industry aisi hi he
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali employs hundreds of people
 ham unke saath aisa vyavhaar katai bardaasht nahin kar sakate'
 The Directors Association will use a special poster to oppose it
 isamen par likhaa he, 'main ek filmmekar hum or mujhe film banane di jaae'
 Khalji was not crazy about Padmavati, said, "I have 1600 beautiful wives
 The Association of Four Wives has appealed to Union Minister Smriti Irani and Home Minister Rajnath Singh along with four other organizations to take a stand on the release of the film
" diarectors association ke alaava tivi artist association, cinemetographers association, screen play association or art diarector va costum diziners ke sanghathan ne bhi bhansaali ke samarthan main aawaaj uthaai he
 Chairman of the Directors Association BP Singh said, Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a well-known filmmaker, he has taken the film industry to a different level
 pehle film ko relies hone den, phir darshakon ko tay karne den
 Bhansali understands that this is not a license or a miss use
 ham sab is virodh ke khilaaf hai or bhansaali ke saath khadey hai
 Haryana Minister's charge- If Bhansali's 'padmavati' glorification of Khilji is not released in these states, then it will be effective that Padmavati is being opposed in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and every Haryana
 agar in chaar rajyon main ye film relies nahi hui to is film par auki iske bajet par iskaa kya asar hoga ye dekhnaa dilaschasp he
 We spoke to Komal Nahata, the trade analyst of Bollywood to know this

 The entire area of rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana and half of Mumbai circuit in Gujarat
 kul milakar film ko nuksaan hoga
 More than 18–19 percent of the film will be affected
 agsibitors ko bhi ab dar lagane laga he, kyonki agar todphod hui to unka bhi nuksaan hoga
 Let me tell you that the budget of the film Padmavati is around 180 to 190 crores and in such a situation, it is interesting to see whether this film can be released in these states after so many contracts

 The comments ‘aap’ netaa ne apane twitor sandesh main kaha, ‘modi raaj main kisaan or jawan donon khudakushi kar rahe hai

 com (@theweddingbrigade) on Nov 21, 2018 at 6:48 am PST i have seen some media is twisting my comments made in an interview
 Here is what i said - it may seem to some people that Mr Modi is stronger on terror but i think this is a poll gimmick more than anything else
 
 Explain that in an interview, Sheila Dikshit said that former PM Manmohan Singh's stand against terror was not as tough as Narendra Modi (narendra Modi)
 dilli congress pramukh shila dikshit ne kaha tha ki 26 / 11 ke mumbai aatanki hamalon (mumbai Terror Attack) ke baad purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii 'pratikriya', pulavama aatanki hamale (pulwama Terror Attack) ke baad pradhanmantri narendra modi (PM Narendra Modi) kii tarah 'majboot or drudh nahin' thi
 However, Sheila Dikshit has also said that most of Narendra Modi's work is politically motivated and for political gains
 shila dikshit(sheila Dikshit) ne ek intervyuu ke dauraan kaha, 'dekhie, main is baat se sahamat hum ki manmohan singh utane sakht nahin the, jitne vah (modi) hai, lekin mujhe lagata he ki vah ye sab raajnneeti se prerit hokar kar rahe hai
 Sheila Dixit said this on the question of air strike conducted by the Indian Air Force at the camps in Balakot of terrorist organization jaish-e-mohammad on 26 February after the Pulwama terror attack
 udhar, shila dikshit ke bayaan par dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 He said, 'sheila ji's statement is really shocking
 bhaajapa or congress main kuch to khichdi pak rahi he
 On the other hand, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has said on Sheila Dixit's statement that, 'we were already saying that this time Congress is working to make Modi ji again PM

 a drunk youth jumped in front of the lioness
 lekin bhagyavash sherni se use jindagi baksh di
 The officer said that the lioness looked at the young man for a long time, but did not attack him
 adhikari ne kaha, ‘us vakt ehtiyathan kadam uthaae gaye or sherni ko kisi tarah pinjre ke andar bheja gaya
 Scared after escaping, the young man climbed a tree, which was given a lot of respect by the zoo officials for taking it off

 In view of this, where a lot of efforts are being made to save tigers across the country, a tigress was brutally killed in front of forest officials in Churia area of rajnandgaon district of Chhattisgarh
 is ghatana ko aise samay main anjaam diya gaya jab padosi rajya madhya pradesh ke panna tiger rigerv se baaghon ke safaaye kii baat saamne aa rahi he
 The important thing is that instead of finding a solution to the problem, all the departments are busy in blaming each other for the failure
 baaghon kii is durdasha kii daastaan main ek nayaa vakya 24 sitambar ko chhattisgarh ke chhuria ilaake se judaa jahaan takreeban dedh maah pehle maharashtra se ek baghin bhatak kar aa gai thi
 In the early hours of Saturday, a villager in Bakhrutola saw the tigress and told other people
 dekhte-dekhte aasapaas ke gaanvon se 5,000 se adhik log jamaa ho gaye
 People surrounded the tigress in a field with sticks, poles, furs
 subah aath baje se dopaher dedh baje tak gramin baghin ko idhar-se-udhar daudaate rahe
 It is said that information about the lioness being surrounded by villagers was given to the forest department at eight in the morning
 bachaav dal paanch ghante baad jaal or trenculizer lekar dopaher 1 baje pahunchaa
 The team also did not have trained doctors for wildlife
 pashupaalan vibhaag se deputesan par aae doctor ne behosh karne vaali trenculizer gan ko bhi daagne nahin diya
 The doctor said that the trapurizer will be used first when trapped in the trap, while the wildlife experts say that this is the first thing to be used to catch an animal like a lion
 baghin jaise hi jaal main fansi, lathi, danda or pathar liye saikadon log us par tut pade
 In front of people's anger, the staff of forest and police could not do anything
 baghin kii kuch hi der main maut ho gai
 When someone cut his tail, someone took out his teeth and mustache
 baghin ko maarane ke baad graminon ne juluus bhi nikaala
 Villagers suspected that the tigress had killed more than a dozen cattle, along with hunting a woman
 ghatana ke baad van vibhaag ab police ke sir thikra phod rahaa he
 "the staff of the forest department was helpless in front of the crowd," says Forest Minister Vikram Usendi
 police se madad milti to acroshit graminon ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa tha

 However, the forest department claims to have 22 to 25 tigers in the state

 Not only this, hunters killed a leopard by applying a current in the Barnavapara Sanctuary in Raipur district

 On the other hand, if we look at the neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh, then the Tiger Reserve here is no longer the safe haven for the national animal tiger

 a report was sent to the state government's forest department in January 2011 by Srinivas Murthy, director of the Panna Tiger Reserve
 unke mutabik, yahaan 20 varsh kii avadhi main (1990 se 2010) tak 19 baaghon kaa shikaar hua tha
 Six tigers were killed in 2005
 yah shikaar panna tiger rigerv kii chandranagar range main dekhne ko mila, lekin van vibhaag ke afasaron ne kisi prakaar kii karrwai main dilchaspee nahin dikhaai, balki vahaan par maujuud karmchaariyon ne saboot mitaane kaa kaam kiya
 Director Murthy's report states that people from hunter-gatherers, fowlers and Pardi communities are still involved in the hunt and are involved in poisoning, trapping and trapping wild animals from guns

 Pabla also sent a report in the same period
 is report main jor diya gaya he ki tiger rigerv main nar baaghon kii sankhya zyada hone or unamem varchasv kii ladaai hone ke chalate baagh maare gaye hai
 Dr
 pabala murti kii report ko galat bataate hue kehete hai ki panna tiger rigerv ke nideshak murti ne 20 varsh puraane maamalon ko nikaala
 In it he felt that tigers were killed
 kuch shikaar ke maamle jarur saamne aae hai, lekin usamen baagh kii nahin, balki bhaaluu kii haddiyaan baraamad hui thim
 If we look at the latest figures, 49 tigers have disappeared from the state's tiger reserve
 isamen se sabase zyada nuksaan panna tiger rigerv main hua he, jahaan se sabhi 35 baagh gaayab maane ja rahe hai
 This is exactly the same as what happened in the Sariska Tiger Reserve in Rajasthan, from where the entire tiger population disappeared and the entire case was investigated by the CBI, which revealed the fact that the tigers disappeared due to poaching
 dow
 Pabla can say anything, but due to mismanagement in Panna Tiger Reserve, tigers disappeared
 baaghon ke gaayab hone ke bare main kai agenciyon ne pehle bhi chetavanee di thi
 The central government formed a special investigation team and also said that tigers have disappeared due to hunting, not due to natural causes
 is report se rajya van vibhaag ke adhikari santusht nahin hai or baaghon kii maut kaa kaaran prakritik maanate aa rahe hai
 Even after all the facts are revealed, the State Forest Department is not ready to conduct a CBI inquiry
 paanch maah pehle tatkaaleen van evam paryaavaran mantri jairam ramesh ne jab panna tiger rigerv kaa daura kiya tha to unhone bhi sibiai jaanch nahin karaane par afsos jaahir kiya tha
 In this case, efforts are being taken by the institution and it is preparing to go to the Supreme Court regarding the case of CBI investigation
 udhar, van vibhaag panna tiger rigerv main baaghon kaa kunba badhaane kii koshish bhi kar rahaa he
 Three female and one male tigers have been brought here from Kanha and Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve
 isse yahaan par baagh ke chaar shavakon sahit kul das baagh hone kaa daawa kiya ja rahaa he
 But the state government's delay in notifying the emerald buffer zone poses a threat to the existence of tigers
 kanha tiger rigerv main bhi baaghon kii sankhya 89 se 64 par aa gai he
 The state forest department has raised doubts on these figures and has recalculated them
 aise main sawaal vahiin kaa vahiin he ki aakhir panna ke baagh kahaan gaayab ho gaye or phir se in baaghon ko yahaan basaaya ja rahaa he, lekin unhen bachaane ke pukhta bandobast kyon nahin kiye ja rahe hai
 If this is a plodding attitude, then it is no good that the newly inhabited tigers also disappear soon

 ) yogendra yadav or prashanth bhushan aam aadmi party (AAP) main bane rahenge yaa nikaale jaaenge, is faisle main ab 8 din hi baaki hai
 There are discussions that a decision can be taken on the removal of both leaders in the party's National Council meeting to be held on March 28
 baithak se pehle party main paksh or virodh main lobbying kaa silsilaa bhi jari he
 But the author of this article feels that AAP should keep these two leaders with them, which will cause them the least harm
 yogendra or prashanth ko party se na nikaalane kii ye rahi paanch vajahen:1
 The party's canvas is magnified
 Both Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan are among the leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party who feel a direct connection to the ideology, rather than the idea
 yogendra gandhivadi rujhaan ke hai or samaajawaadee janparishad main rahe hai
 At the same time, the political trend of Prashant is considered towards the left
 donon ke bane rahane se party main samaan-aadhaarit raajnneeti or vaicharikta kaa ek santulan bana rahata he, jo hameshaa party ke paksh main hi kaam karata he
 Also, it also enlarges the canvas of the party and the scope of the supporters
 janaadhar ke str par left bhale hi lutaa-pita dikhataa ho, par vam vichaar se sahamat kai log aaj bhi AAP ke liye upyogi bhoomika nibhaa rahe hai
 Some have fought the Lok Sabha elections on a broom ticket and some have sympathy from outside
 maujuuda halaat main yogendra-prashanth ke jane se in sabakaa samarthan bhi chalaa jayega
 It is not that this will move the party towards an alleged 'communal' image, but still the supporters of secular politics will surely be offended by this
 party main istifon kii jhadi lag sakati he
 2
 yogendra ek upyogi pravaktaa, kaamyaab safologistoaf ke liye yogendra yadav ko khona ek upyogi shaks ko khona hoga
 He is one of the most eminent sapphologists in the country and a very polite and brilliant spokesperson
 unke sahaj, saumy, shant or dheer vyaktitv kaa phayda party ko miltaa rahata he
 The way he speaks on news channels, many AAP supporters are fascinated by his style
 haalia dilli chunaav main bhi aam aadmi party ko unki kaabiliyat kaa khub laabh mila
 He was one of the strategists, surveying the party's position in every assembly seat and at the same time strongly stating the party's position in the media
 jab saare agsit pole party ko bahumat de rahe the, phir bhi vah ade hue the ki ab bhi unki siten kam dikhaai ja rahi hai
 His assessment was mocked on social media, but in the end he proved to be very close to the truth
 is chunaav main yogendra ne kaaphi reliyaan bhi kin or kuch siton par unki maujuudagi kaa thik-thaak asar bhi padaa
 He is the biggest leader of the party in Haryana and he is also seen as the future Chief Minister in the party
 haryana AAP ke liye agali upjau jameen ho saktaa he, lekin yogendra ke jane se us jameen kaa bhavi kisaan AAP se chhin saktaa he
 3
 prashanth bhushan, crusyder against karpshanayah baat prashanth bhushan par bhi lagu hoti he
 Talking on paper, Prashant Bhushan is not the biggest hero against corruption in the Aam Aadmi Party
 vah hameshaa kuch na kuch khoji nikaalane main lage rahete hai or ahm muddon par yachikaayen fansaate rahete hai
 This style of his is quite similar to the modalities of the Aam Aadmi Party
 apane vakalati upakramon se unhone kai bade ghotaalon kii kalai kholi he
 Former CBI director Ranjit Sinha was stirring up by claiming that he was meeting the accused while investigating the 2G case
 vipakshiyon ko gherne ke liye dastavej jutaney hon yaa kisi sarkari-takneekee yaa court sambandhi aadesh kii vyakhya kerani ho, vah har lihaaj se party ke liye turup ke ikke hai
 Polite by nature and also immaculate public life
 kashmir par unke vivaadit bayaan ko chhod den to janata main unki chhavi bhi acchhee he
 The credit for the positive impact of their petitions will never be put into the AAP bag
 4
 Blasphemous Nire Rakhiyogendra and Prashant have played an important role in raising the party
 yogendra ke chehre par syaahi potee gai or kejariwal ko reeha karwaane ke liye pradarshan karte hue vah thane main soe
 Prashant Bhushan openly expressed his 'disputed' but outspoken opinion on the Kashmir issue
 yogendra saarvajanik maukon par party kii kamiyaan swikaarne se bhi hichakate nahin hai
 Overall, from the image of both, it seems that within the party they will always be vigilant on public issues and express disagreements
 saath hi, bhitari-bahari muddon par aalochak ke taur par hameshaa upyogi honge
 a party that has stood for transparency as the key principle, it should not be insecure by internal differences
 5
 Damage control is now necessary
 The party's well-wishers and activists are unhappy about their being expelled
 kaaryakartaaon ko lagata he ki 2013 main janata se poochkar sarkaar banane vaale ab apane kaaryakartaaon kii raay lene se bhi hichak rahe hai
 Even today, Kejriwal is the biggest leader for the workers, but no one is digesting the way Yogendra and Prashant are being evicted
 khaas taur se party ko khub chanda dene vaale enarai samarthak isse khaase naaraaz hai
 The opinion of the activists about the 'kejriwal Brigade' is not very good
 bhale hi yah thookkar chaatane jaisaa lage, par apni vishwasaneeyata bachaane ke liye AAP ke paas yahi rasta he ki vah yogendra or prashanth ko party main banaae rakhe
 This will cause him the least loss
 bihar chunaav se pehle netaaon kii ajab-gajab bayaanbaji kaa daur tej ho gaya he
 MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav gave a controversial statement while releasing his party's manifesto
 pappu yadav ne ghoshnaptr main vaada kiya he ki garibi rekha se neeche rah rahe pariwaron ko tivi set die jaaenge
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Pappu has declared this announcement valid
 unhone kaha, 'garibon ke paas manoranjan ke liye sirf bivi hoti he, isliye main tivi de rahaa hum
 However, there is bound to be a ruckus on Pappu Yadav's statement
 samajha ja rahaa he ki pappu yadav ke ghoshnaptr ke khilaaf siyaasi partiyaan adarsh aachaar samhita ke maddenjar chunaav ayog bhi ja sakati hai
 Significantly, Pappu Yadav has formed a party under the name of Adhikar Morcha
 bihar chunaav ke liye jan adhikaar morcha, samaajawaadee party, NCP, samras samaaj party, samaajawaadee janata dal or neshnal pipuls party ne milakar tisare morcha kaa gathan kiya he
 This alliance will contest all 243 seats
 jan adhikaar morcha ko 64 siten di gai hai

 " uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav kii rath yatra ke samarthan main lakhanu shahar main lage lakhon postaron ke bich ab aise poster bhi dikhaai dene lage hai jisamen shivpal bhi apane bhattije akhilesh ko phir se mukhyamantri banane kaa aashirwad de rahe hai
 These posters are surprising people
 shivpal nahin dikhnaa chaahate alagasamajawaadee yuvajan sabha neise poster lagaejisame likhaa he, 'kahe shivpal dil se, akhilesh kaa abhishek phir se'
 It is clear now that when the party and workers are standing with Akhilesh at this point, Shivpal does not want to look isolated
 akhilesh virdohi ban gai thi chhavipichley kai dinon se lakhanu main lage akhilesh ke samaajawaadee yatra ke postaron kii is ladaai ne dikhaa diya ki shivpal yadav isamen akele pad chuke he
 In the preparations for the Samajwadi Yatra of November 3, Shivpal not only appeared isolated but his image became even anti-akhilesh
 aise main unke samarthakon ne ye tarika dhundha or aise poster lagaae ki ab chachaa bhi saath he
 It is difficult to say how much consent Shivpal has in this poster, but now Shivpal's supporters do not want to look less isolated from work, it is becoming clear
 akhilesh ke liye ahm he ye yatrikhilesh ke liye ye samaajawaadee vikaas yatra unke swabhimaan or party par unke varchasv se judi he
 Also, Akhilesh's lone attempt to form the government again is also a demonstration, in such a situation, Akhilesh is starting his journey with his full grand performance
 shivpal ke yatra main shaamil hone na hone par kayassabaki nazren is baat par bhi tiki hai kishivpalakal kii rathyatra main mulaayam ke saath aate hai yaa nahin
 According to sources, if Akhilesh or Mulayam invites, Shivpal can also be present on the stage while flagging the yatra with Mulayam

 fasebuk ke jariye peedita kii aaropee se dosti hui
 Pretending to be in love, he also asked for pornographic photos of the victim
 iske baad shaadi kaa jhansa dekar uske saath shaareerik sambandh banaae
 On the complaint of the victim, the police has arrested the accused
 aaropee kaa naam sudarshan kamble he
 He created a fake ID on Facebook under the name Aryan Sawant
 fasebuk ke jariye usne 17 saal kii seemaa (badla hua naam) se dosti kar lee
 On seeing this, friendship turned into love and the two often met
 seemaa sudarshan ke iraadon se anjaan thi
 Sudarshan photographed his nude one day from the border
 seemaa ne manaa kar diya, lekin vah pyaar ke aage bebas ho chuki thi
 Seema sends her some of her nude photos
 iske baad sudarshan ne peedita ko shaadi kaa jhansa dekar uske saath shaareerik sambandh banaae or chori-chhipe iskaa video record kar liya

 The Supreme Court, in its judgment, mentioned a law made in 1991, this act excluded the Ram janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute, the historic decision of the Supreme Court on Saturday on the Tharam janmabhoomi-babri Masjid dispute
 ayodhya main yah vivaad sadiyon se chalaa aa rahaa tha
 a five-judge constitutional bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi has handed over the disputed land to Ramlala Virajman while delivering the verdict
 jabaki muslim pakshakaar sunni vaff board ko court ne ayodhya main hi alag jagah 5 acre jameen dene kaa aadesh diya he
 The Supreme Court mentioned the Special Worship Provision Act in the judgment, along with this decision, this bench of the Supreme Court has also made its stand clear on all the disputed shrines of the country
 gauratlab he ki supreme court ne apane 1,045 pej ke faisle main 11 july, 1991 ko lagu hue plases of varship (special provision) act, 1991 kaa zikr bhi kiya he
 That is, the apex court has given a clear message that the current situation in Kashi and Mathura will remain the same, there is no scope for any change in it
 supreme court ne kaha, yah kanoon samvidhan ke mulyon ko majboot karata haichif justise ranjan gogoi, justise es
 a
 bobade, justise divai chandrachud, justise ashok bhushan or justise es
 Abdul Nazir's bench in its judgment spoke of the secular character of the country
 court ne apane faisle main kaha ki 1991 kaa yah kanoon desh main samvidhan ke mulyon ko majboot karata he
 Apart from this, the bench also stressed on the protection of the status quo of religious places present during the independence of the country
 bench ne kaha, "desh ne is act ko lagu karke sanvaidhanik patibaddhta ko majboot karne or sabhi dharmon ko samaan maanane or secularism ko banaae rakhane kii pahal kii he
 "why this act was formed in 1991 was Narasimha Rao's government at the Center
 raav sarkaar ko shaayad ek saal pehle hi ayodhya main babari vidhwans jaisaa kuch hone kii ashanka ho gai thi
 At that time, the dispute was not only about Ayodhya, there were many religious places like Kashi and Mathura, whose condition was largely like Ayodhya
 kisi dharmik sthal par babari vidhwans jaisaa kuch na ho iske liye us vakt (1991 main) ek kanoon paas hua
 The same law was named the Places of Worship (special Provisions) Act, 1991
 kya kahata he yah actpleses of varship (special provision) act, 1991 main kahi gai baat kaa saar keval ek line kaa he, lekin is ek line ne dheron vivaadon ko ek saath samaapt kar diya
 In this act, it was clearly mentioned that the religious place which belonged to the religious place on August 15, 1947, will remain the same today, and in the future
 ayodhya vivaad ko rakhaa gaya tha bahrayahaa aapako yah bhi bataa den ki bhale hi yah act ayodhya vivaad kii vajah se laayaa gaya tha lekinis act se ram janmabhumi-babari masjid vivaad ko baahar rakhaa gaya thakhyonki tab tak yah vivaad desh kii raajnneeti se nikalakar janamanas tak pahunch gaya tha
 a Muslim organization has opposed this act a few months back in 2018, a Muslim organization has opposed this act
 us sanghathan kaa maananaa tha ki isaki vajah se chaahakar bhi ham wo sthal hinduon ko nahin de paaenge jo ham dena chaahate hai
 Explain that Shia Central Board Chairman Wasim Rizvi had said that under the 'special Worship Provision Act', since the disputed mosques have been secured and since it would be difficult to hand them over to Hindus, it should be scrapped
 iske saath hi wasim rizvi ne yah bhi maang kii thi ki ek special cameti banaakar adaalat kii nigaraanee main vivaadit masjidon ke bare main thik-thik jaankaree ikattha kii jaae or agar yah siddh ho jaae ki ve hinduon ke dharm sthalon ko todakar banaae gaye hai to unhen hinduon ko waapas kiya jaae

 Shivpal Singh Yadav, the head of the Progressive Samajwadi Party, said in Etawah on Saturday that he would contest the Lok Sabha elections from Firozabad on the demand of the people
 unhone daawa kiya ki chunaav ke baad centre main pragatisheel samaajawaadee party ke bina koi dal sarkaar nahin bana sakegaa
 Addressing a function on Republic Day at the Dhanankheda Inter College in Etawah, Shivpal said that among the millions of people in Lucknow, we said that i do not want anything, no ministerial post or anything else, only respect
 lekin shadyantr kar unhen party se alag kiya gaya
 Hitting nephew Akhilesh Yadav, he said that he was cheated and forced to form the Progressive Samajwadi Party
 shivpal ne sapa-basapa gathbandhan par kaha ki basapa ne sapa ko jhatka dekar teen baar bhaajapa ke sahyog se sarkaar banaai
 He said that the alliance with Mulayam Singh as "gunda", sp's goon party and the party calling him a misdemeanor is a clear insult to father and uncle
 upi bijepi ke adhyaksh keshav prasad maury kaa kahana he ki party ko ek bhi aisa musalmaan kaaryakarta nahin mila jise tikat dete to wo jeet jaataa
 Maurya said this in a special conversation with Aaj Tak
 unhone mayawati se sawaal karte hue kaha ki unhone dalito kaa tikat katkar musalamaanon ko kyon diya
 He said that if the BJP comes into the government, it will not only investigate Akhilesh's 5 years but also Mayawati's five years and Mulayam Singh's tenure of 14 years
 pesh hai is exlusive intervyuu ke ansh-lagbhag aadha chunaav nikal chukaa he, kya he bijepi kaa akalan?pehle, duusare charan main vot pratishat kaaphi he, ham jeet rahe hai
 
 
 Heavy turnout in favor of BJP, this augurs well for BJP
 
 
 jatvaad bhufiaon ko logon ne nakaara he
 
 
 People want a government with good governance
 aapane voters ko polaraise karne kii koshishen kii hai
 
 
 We have not made any attempt to polarize, we talk about everyone's development
 modi sarkaar ne sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas ke saath apni yojanaayen lagu kii hai
 
 
 See Akhilesh government gives 30 thousand rupees for inter-pass for Muslim daughters, but nothing for Hindu daughters, but in the neighboring Madhya Pradesh, see that we implement such schemes without discrimination
 
 
 vahaan naaraa he beti-beti ek samaan hindu ho yaa musalmaan
 
 
 You did not give a ticket to the Muslims, do you not need the votes of the Muslims or do you want the Muslims not to vote for you, so that the election is polarized, then you will win? See if we give the ticket to the Muslim, then we are considered secular If you go, BJP should not want such secularism
 bijepi usee ko tikat degi jo jeetne laayak hoga, party ke survey main aayega, kaaryakarta kii sahmati hogi
 In UP, we could not find a single worker whom we would have won if we had given tickets
 meraa sawaal mayawati se he ki unhone daliton kaa tikat katkar kyon musalamaanon ko tikat diya
 
 
 My question to Akhilesh is how many Dalits and obcs have given tickets to Muslims
 
 
 ye donon yah bataaen ki musalamaanon kii aabaadi kitni pratishat he, unka haq kitna banataa he jo itane tikat die gaye
 They will have to answer this
 hamaare paas kaaryakarta nahin he ,jab hoga ham ladaayenge
 No MP from UP went by winning, but we sent Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi to Rajya Sabha
 
 
 emje akbar ko rajyasabha bheja
 
 
 Made both of them ministers
 
 
 koi musalmaan jitkar to nahin gaya, lekin hamane banaaya
 
 
 The answer should be given to those who cut the tickets of the backward and Dalits, only because of the politics of appeasement, to those who were fundamentalists, those who were accused of the riots
 sachcha raamarajy aap bijepi sarkaar main dekhenge
 You are talking about the kingdom of Rama
 
 The leaders of your party are saying that a government will be formed and a Ram temple will be built
 
 
 hamane apane ghoshnaptr main saaf kiya ki sarkaar banane ke baad jald hi mandir banane kii baadhaon ko dur kiya jayega
 There is no time frame
 pashchimi upi main aapane anti romeo squad or yantric katlakhaanon kaa mudadda banaaya, lekin purvi upi main ye aapkaa mudda nahin he
 
 
 It is not that, see if the knife will continue on the neck of milch animals, then the children of the coming generations will drink blood, they will not get milk
 
 
 agar doodh chahie to aise katlakhaane pratibandhit hone chahie
 
 
 Crime of crime against women has increased in UP, Akhilesh is a minister in the government of two rapes and there is no concern about his arrest during Akhilesh
 
 
 jab supreme court ne gayatri ke khilaaf aadesh diya tab report likhane kaa aadesh hua
 When the Supreme Court has to speak about Gayatri, you can understand the situation of the Supreme Court
 upi kii peedit janata kii is sarkaar main sunwaayee nahin hui
 Questions are being raised on pm's language
 
 
 'upi ne mujhe god liya he' is par khub sawaal uth rahe hai
 
 
 Since the day the PM said that i am the adopted son of UP, since then the entire state is dirty
 jo upi se saansad he, upi se gaharaa rishta jodakar vikaas karnaa chahta he , to ye badi baat he
 Modi ji is the son of the country, he is the son of the state, he considers the whole country as his family
 piem ne aisi baat kar upi ke dil ko chuaa he or duusare log diwaar khadi kar rahe hai jise upi kii janata dhaha rahi he
 Why are you saying about the debt waiver of the farmers only on forgiving their own government, if you wanted, you could have made this announcement in the Akhilesh government too
 
 
 dekhie cabinet kii pehali baithak main laghu or majhole kisaanon kaa karj maaf karenge, kyonki halaat badahaal hai
 i am also the son of a farmer, i understand the pain of the farmer
 philhal to ham puraa karj maaf karegein, lekin bhavishya main agar koi kisaan karj legaa to use byaaj nahin chukaana padegaa, sirf karj waapas karnaa padegaa byaaj nahin
 You are cursing the Akhilesh government, but there is no personal anti incumbency against Akhilesh
 
 
 vikaas ke naam par ek dhokheybaaj mukhyamantri hai akhilesh
 There is so much anger against Akhilesh in UP that the air of the bicycle has gone out
 kitna gussa he, iskaa anjaada aap nahin laga sakate
 On the 11th, when the votes are counted, then the camel will come under the mountain
 sarkari paise ke bal par vigyaapan dekar vikaas dikhaa rahi he, jameen par jaaen to na to sadak he, na bijli, naa pine kaa pani mil rahaa he or na hi suraksha mil rahi he
 What will you do if you come to power, because there is no stain on Akhilesh till now
 
 
 akhilesh yadav puri tarah se daagdar mukhyamantri he
 If the Indian government builds a road worth 14 crore rupees per km, then Akhilesh replies how he made 30 to 40 crores per km
 noida main 100 karod rupye prati kimi metro banati he to lakhanu main 200 karod rupye prati kimi kaise banati he
 Akhilesh Yadav has sold jobs
 kya aap akhilesh ke khilaaf jaanch karaayenge ?sirf akhilesh ke 5 saal kii hi nahin balki mayawati ke paanch saal auki akhilesh ke pitaaji mulaayam singh ke kaarykaal 14 saal ke bhrashtachar kii jaanch bhi karaayenge or doshi chaahe koi ho mantri ,adhikari thekedaar sabhi kii jaanch hogi or unhe dand milegaa
 You talk of sending Akhilesh to jail, will we do this? No matter how big the culprit is, we will send him to jail
 jisane pradesh ko lutaa he or jaanch main agar lutere sabit hue to sajaa milegi
 It does not seem that after the family feud, a new image of Akhilesh has come out and he has eliminated all the tainted people and has emerged as a new Akhilesh
 
 
 sapa kaa matlab gundaraj, jameen kabja karne kaa license mil gaya, thane main baithkar manmarjee se karrwai karne kaa adhikaar mil gaya
 Samajwadi Party goons, criminals, Mafia SP have not left anywhere
 wo vahiin baithe hai
 The public is stricken with them
 akhilesh ne aparaadhiyon ko roka nahin balki jati or dharm dekhakar police ko karrwai karne kii chhot di
 Seeing that Azam Khan is a relative of Saifai, action was taken in the SP government
 is kaaran se pradesh main aparaadh kaa graph ooncha gaya
 BJP was full of outsiders, you gave tickets to people from outside leaving your people, didn't you trust your workers? We did not give tickets to everyone, have fought 30-40 strong people who are going to win elections Huh
 jo naaraaz the unhe manaa liya he, jo uske baad bhi naaraaz hai unke khilaaf karrwai karenge
 Not a single BJP worker has gone with the fighters
 bijepi main asantosh naam kii koi cheez nahin, sabhi ko manaa liya gaya he
 Large leaders were side-lined, Varun Gandhi was not used
 kai netaaon ko bijepi ne poocha tak nahin
 Why? The entire central and state leadership is engaged and the honor that everyone should give has been given
 purvanchal main ham badi vijay kii ore batch rahe hai
 Whom is your fight with? Do not ask who we are fighting with, rather the situation is SP and BSP are fighting with us, somewhere BSP is fighting with us and somewhere SP is fighting with us
 rahul or akhilesh koi sunanaa nahin chahta or na hi dekhnaa chahta he
 They are not able to do the gathering, only doing road shows so that they get jammed, crowds may come in some way
 logon kaa gussa matdaan ke din iviem me dikhaai de rahaa he
 Who will be the Chief Minister, will Keshav Prasad be the Maurya face? The BJP Chief Minister will be the BJP, the decision will be decided by the elected MLA and the central leadership
 cheharaa agada hoga yaa pichhadaa ham is tarah kii raajnneeti nahin karte, ye bijepi tay karegi koun hoga siem
 You are in a race

 kade suraksha intjaamon ke bich pradarshnakariyon ne dilli or centre sarkaar ke khilaaf jamkar narebaazi kii
 The working class is particularly involved in this organization, which is demanding to reduce the metro fare
 bhartiya majdoor sangh ne aam aadmi party or centre sarkaar ke saath-saath dmarsi ko chetavanee di he ki agar metro kiraaya badhaane ke faisle ko waapas nahin liya gaya to unke samarthak metro rokane kaa andolan shuru kar sakate hai
 Brijesh Upadhyay, National General Secretary of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, said that the Metro passengers in Delhi are laborers and it is wrong to increase the fare in such a situation when the wages of a laborer are not doubled
 dilli sarkaar agar kiraaya rokane ke liye kadam uthaati to sangh uske saath khadey rahati lekin kejariwal sarkaar naatak kar rahi he
 The union official says that the Aam Aadmi Party government is also a part of the committee and the fare has been increased only with their consent
 brijesh upaadhyaay ne yah bhi kaha ki majdoor hit ke liye centre sarkaar ko bhi metro kiraaya badhane se rokna chahie
 Delhi's Organization Minister Pawan Kumar says that the increase in fare will increase the burden on Delhi's laborers traveling in the metro
 agar majdoor rojaanaa 30 kilometre se zyada safar karegaa to 40 rupye zyada dena hoga
 In this situation, small workers cannot bear the burden of minimum Rs 600 and maximum of Rs 1200
 pawan kumaar ne dilli sarkaar par bhi nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha ki dilli sarkaar ne dhol bajaakar nunatam vetan badhotaree kii baat kahi thi lekin 15 agast ke elaan ke baad abtak badha hua vetan lagu nahin hua he
 According to the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the poor laborers will come on the path of starvation if the Metro fare increases, because the government increases the fare immediately but does not increase the wages

 PS Office sealed: The North Delhi Municipal Corporation had sealed the PS office of the Commissioner of South Delhi Municipal Corporation regarding the issue
 lekin dakshini dilli nagar nigam ne sil ko tod diya tha
 After this, the matter has increased a lot
 ab exiaar karaane kii taiyaari bhi kii ja rahi he
 On the other hand, BJP is trying to find a middle way
 lekin uttari nagar nigam ne bhi kanoonee karrwai kii taiyaari shuru kar di he
 The headquarters of both the corporations at the Civic Center are, in fact, the headquarters of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation and the South Delhi Municipal Corporation at the Civic Center, but the North Delhi Municipal Corporation attributes it as its share
 vahi, dakshini dilli nagar nigam isamen kirayedar he
 On this issue, the Northern Municipal Corporation had issued a notice that the Southern Municipal Corporation should pay them money as rent
 notice main saaf ye kaha gaya tha ki agar saat dinon ke andar kiraye kaa paisa nahin diya gaya to unke offis ko sil kar diya jayega
 It will start from the commissioner's office
 810 karod rupee kirayauttari nagar nigam ke mutabik, dakshini dilli ne jab se yahaan unke daftar bane hai tab se ek rupee bhi nahin diya he
 From the year 2012 to 2016, the total rent is Rs 810 crore
 lekin kai baar notice dene ke baad bhi dakshini dilli nagar nigam is maamle se pallaa jhaadte najar aayaa he
 After the split of MCD, the civic center got 40 per cent share to South Delhi Municipal Corporation, 40 per cent to North Delhi and 20 per cent to East Delhi Municipal Corporation
 jabaki purvi dilli nagar nigam ko jo mukhyalay diya gaya he, jo dakshini dilli nagar nigam ne diya he
 Accordingly, South Delhi has 60 per cent share, hence the tenant is North Delhi
 puspak express ke baad ab anya trainon ke general dibbon main bhi savaar hone ke liye dhakkamukki or marpet kii naubat khatm hone vaali he
 There will be seats on first come first serve basis
 iske liye railway suraksha bal(arpeef) ne khaas pahal kii he
 Trial of biometric system in Pushpak Express running from Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Lucknow has been successful
 jiske baad dhire-dhire ab anya trainon main bhi is upaay ko lagu kar bheed prabandhan kii taiyaari he
 With the introduction of the system, passengers will be able to board the coaches only after passing through the biometric machine
this initiative by RPF, rail mantri piyush goyal ke nirdesan main aam rail yatriyon kii takalifon ko dur karne ke maddenjar arpeef kii ore se kii gai yah pahal steshnon par yatriyon kii bheed sanbhaalane main behad madadgaar maani ja rahi
 Director General of RPF and 1985 batch IPS officer Arun Kumar, who prepared the road management crowd of the passengers who flocked to the stations, performed aajtak at Rail Bhavan
 in se baatcheet main bataaya ki mumbai ke chaar steshnon par biomitric mashine laga di gai hai
 The trial in Pushpak Express has been successful for the last four months
 ab jarurat ke hisaab se un sabhi trainon kii general bogiyon main yatriyon ke pravesh ke liye biomitric suvidha lagu karne kii taiyaari he, jisamen baari bheed ke kaaran updrav kii sthiti ho jaati he
 Due to the biometric facility, there will not be any fighting between passengers to occupy the seats of trains
 RPF ke mahanideshak arun kumaar ne 'ajtak' se kaha ki biomitric system kii safalataa ke baad ise or trainon main lagu karne kii yojana he
 Photo- (navneet) Soldiers and coolies used to sell seats
 Actually, there is a huge crowd of passengers at stations like Delhi, Mumbai etc
 badi taadaad main log anarakshit yani general dibbon main safar karte hai
 Commuters clamor to climb in general coaches
 seat ke chakkar main train chalane ke ghanton pehle se hi yatri date rahete hai
 There have been allegations that Cooli and some RPF constables at stations sell the seats of General coaches with money
 vahi yatra general dibbe main chadh paata he, jo unhen paise chukaata he
 People who paid no money were able to climb into bogies in the end
 ise dekhte hue arpeef ke diji arun kumaar ne trial ke taur par pehle lambii duuri kii or bahut bheedbhad vaali puspak express main biomitric system lagu karne kii yojana banaai
 DG Arun Kumar found that the use of technology helped q management
 plateform par bhagdad kii naubat khatm hui
 The passengers started riding in the coaches easily
 kaise kaam karata he biomitric systamajab aap stesan par pahunchenge to sambandhit train main savaar hone ke liye aapako biomitric system se guzarana hoga
 You will have to give finger prints by putting a finger in the machine
 finger print dene ke baad bogi main aapke liye seat rigerv ho jaaegi
 After this you can be carefree
 aapako plateform par hi date rahane kii jarurat nahin
 When it is time for the train, you will get an entry in the bogie from the RPF by reaching the spot and again matching your finger print
 bogi kii jitani kshamta hogi, utani hi mashin finger print legi
 Thus people will get seats easily on first come-first served basis
 unhen seat ke liye maaramaari karne kii jarurat nahin hogi
 Latecomers will also be able to climb, but they will not be able to get a seat on the strength of jugaad

 com / o0dqhj3chw— Kareena Kapoor Khan (@kareenak_fc)june 4, 2016yah aayojan mahilaon ke menstrial hygiene se judaa tha
 On this occasion, Kareena Kapoor gave her views on the issue like this: 1
 main periods par logon kii pichhadi soch ko lekar hairaan hum
 2
 ladakiyon ko chahie ki vah pariods se judi pareshaani ke bare main parents se baat karen or ise baaki normal dinon kii tarah hi len
 3
 periods ke dauraan mahilaon kii samasya ko purushon ko bhi samajhnaa chahie
 They should help women by supporting them
 4
 Due to periods, there should not be any hindrance in girls' studies and other work
 ladkiyaan aaj har kaam main aage hai to unhen har tarah kaa mauka milanaa jaruri he
 Girls should not be denied opportunities thinking that they are physically weak
 5
 Another important thing should be to provide separate toilet facilities for girls in schools and colleges
 karina pehali baar periods jaise mudde par bebaaki se baat karti najar ain
 Kareena described her thoughts very well in Hindi language very seriously
 purv pakistani cricketer imran khan kii duusari shaadi ke sirf 10 maheene baad talaak par khatm hone ke do hafte baad unki duusari patni rahi reham khan ne daawa kiya he ki unhen kaha gaya tha ki vah rasoighar main roti banaaengi or baahar najar nahin aaengi
 Pakistan's legendary cricketer-turned-politician Imran and 42-year-old TV journalist Reham decided to separate on 30 October
 is bich is tarah kii khabaren thi ki imran ko raajnneeti main rehaan kii dakhsandaji pasand nahin he
 Emraan had previously married England's Jemima Goldsmith, which broke up in June 2004 after a nine-year relationship
 reham ne bhi imran se pehle ek or nikaah kiya tha or unke teen bachche the
 She returned to Pakistan in 2013, leaving the job at regional BBC News
 reham ne sande times se kaha, ‘mujhe varisht salaahkaar ne vishesh taur par nirdesh diya tha
 They wanted me to stay in the kitchen and make loaves and not be seen outside
 ’ reham ne kaha ki jab se vah or unki choti beti bani galaa main imran ke manson main pahunchi thi jab se hi unhen lag rahaa tha ki unhen dabaaya ja rahaa he
 Rehm said that her career was becoming a constant problem, especially since she became the ambassador of street children in Peshawar
 unhone kaha, ‘main kisi tarah iskaa hissaa nahin thi
 i have never attended meetings or any other event but of course there was insecurity
 ’ reham ne kaha ki unhone hiton ke takaraav se bachane ke liye apana televijan sho chhod diya or kai maheenon tak kaam nahin kiya
 Regarding Imran, Rehm said, 'I tried to talk to him
 main kaaphi baat karti hum lekin aap imran khan ke saath aisa nahin kar sakate
 You cannot talk about the color of curtains, you can only talk about politics
 aap uske saath baliwood filmon par baat nahin kar sakate
 Allah knows that i attempted to do so

 a round of speculation has begun about Team India's explosive batsman Virender Sahwagaki's return to the Indian team
 england ke purv ballebaaj jeophri bykaat ne kaha ki virendra sahvaag kaa dobaaraa bharat ke liye khelnaa sambhav nahin he or tii-20 lig 6 main kuch match khilne ke baad ‘dukhad rup se uski vidaai’ ho jaayegi
 Sehwag was recently dropped from the squad for the last two Tests in the Test series against Australia, he was also not included in the list of 30 potential players selected for the Champions Trophy
 bykaat ne kaha, ‘mujhe nahin lagata ki vah dobaaraa khelegaa
 i think so because the Indian team is moving in the right direction
 unhen yahaan tak pahunchane ke liye thodaa samay laga
 He has now given a chance to young players
 ’april 2012 ke baad se aath test maichon main sahvaag 31
 He has scored only 408 runs at an average of 38 with 117 runs being the best
 isi dauraan chah vanade maichon main unhone 30
 He scored 183 runs at an average of 5 and was dropped from the squad for the ODI series against England
 sahvaag ne vanade main shatak disambar 2011 main westeindies ke khilaaf doharaa shatak lagaakar banaaya tha
 Boycott said that India has done the right thing by including young players in the national team
 unhone kaha, ‘england se haarane ke baad main lagaataar kah rahaa tha ki aapako in yuva ballebaajon ko mauka dena chahie
 You should prepare them for the World Cup by including them in the team
 mere is vichaar main koi badlaav nahin hua
 You are the world champion in odis, you should move forward
 yah myne nahin rakhata ki aap kauna ho, main hameshaa kahata hum ki umr koi baadha nahin he, sirf pradarshan ahm hota he
 Boycott said that Sehwag is one of the best batsmen of the last 20 years and defensive technique is his only drawback
 unhone kaha, ‘vah apane hi tareeke se kheltaa he or kabhi kabhaar kuch pichon par kaaphi safal bhi rahaa he
 But when the ball moves more and there is more bounce then its defensive technique is revealed
 lekin sahvaag ne apane tareeke se khelte hue hi ran banaaye hai
 ' satta badalte hi kaise shashan ke dhang badal jate hai, bujadkhaanon par karrwai yah saaf jaahir karti he
 In April last year, when the National Green Tribunal (NGT) called upon the State Pollution Control Board to give details of the abattoirs operating in the state, it was shocking
 pradooshan niyantran board ne engiti ko bataaya tha ki soobe main chal rahe 126 bujadkhaanon main keval ek ke paas hi sanchaalan kii anumati he
 Following the strict approach of the NGT, the Pollution Control Board immediately ordered action on all illegal abattoirs, but officials sat on it with a coil
 is mudde ko bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) ne lapak liya or sarkaar banate hi sabhi yantric bujadkhaanon ko band karne kaa chunavi vaada jor-shor se kiya
 On March 19, as soon as the BJP government, under the leadership of Yogi Aditya Nath, took power, the officers set out to crack down on illegal abattoirs
 puure pradesh main abhiyaan chalaakar 48 ghante ke bheetar chaar darjan se adhik bujadkhaanon ko sil kar diya gaya
 After the administration's action, people came out in protest in Allahabad, Meerut, Kanpur
 ab bhaajapa sarkaar kii asal chunauti un yantric bujadkhaanon ko band karne kii he jiskaa vaada usne apane chunavi sankalp-patr main kiya he
 There are a total of 44 mechanical slaughterhouses in the state which are governed by the laws of the local body
 inase har varsh do hajaar karod ru
 The meat is sent overseas
 meerut main yantric bujadkhaanaa chalaane vaale yaqub kuraishi kehete hai, ''yantric bujadkaane nigam act ke mutabik sanchalit hai
 They cannot be closed by order of anyone
 "bhaajapa sarkaar ke saamne chunauti un 15,000 mazdooron kii bhi he jin par bujadkhaanon par taale latakane ke baad berozegaar ho jane kaa khatra mandara rahaa he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was also aware of these challenges when he had his first meeting with officials in the Chief Minister's Office at 3 pm on 20 March
 adityanath ne baithak main pahunche sabhi adhikariyon ko bhaajapa kaa chunavi sankalp-patr thamaya or usee ke mutabik yojanaon kaa prastaav taiyaar karne ko kaha
 Certainly the biggest challenge before the BJP government, which returned to power in UP after a decade and a half, is to win the trust by fulfilling the election promises
 karj maafee kii parikshapradhanmantri narendra modi ne 13 farvari ko lakhimpur kii chunavi raily main ghoshnaa kii thi ki pradesh main bhaajapa sarkaar banane par pehali cabinet baithak main kisaanon kaa karj maaf kar diya jayega
 BJP has promised to waive crop loans of farmers in its election pledge
 krishi vibhaag ke aankadon ke anusaar, pradesh main 2
 There are 33 crore farmers of which 1
 85 seemaant kisaan or 30 lakh laghu kisaan hai
 The Department of Institutional Finance is getting crop loans assessed on farmers through the State Bankers Committee
 disambar, 2016 tak jutaaye gaye aankadon ke mutabik, pradesh ke kisaanon par kuch 92,000 karod ru
 There is crop loan, in which the share of small and marginal farmers is 61,000 crores
 vitt vibhaag ke ek adhikari bataate hai, ''pradesh kii vittiya haalat aisi nahin he jo kisaanon kii karj maafee kaa jokhim le saken
 This is expected to cause the entire economy to collapse, which will affect other plans as well
 " bhaajapa sarkaar ke liye raahat kii baat yah he ki centre sarkaar kisaanon kii karj maafee par rajya kii madad karne ko taiyaar he
 Professor in the Department of Economics of Lucknow University, Dr
 arvind mohan kehete hai, ''karj maafee se kisaanon kaa koi bhala nahin hone vaala
 The government should increase the income of farmers by providing them the market so that they can pay their debts
 " keval kisaanon kii karj maafee hi nahin bijepi kii kai anya chunavi vaade bhi pradesh ke khajaane par boj badhayenge

 Former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav had strongly publicized the development plans of his government by mentioning the agra-lucknow Expressway in his election rallies

 The expressway passes through a total of 60 assembly constituencies, of which SP has won only 10 and BJP 48 seats
 bijepi sarkaar ke ek varisht cabinet mantri bataate hai, ''sarkaar sapa sarkaar ke dauraan nirmaan kaaryon main hue bhrashtachar kii jaanch ke liye ek ayog kaa gathan kar sakati he jisase nirdhaarit samaysima ke bheetar apni report saunpny hogi
 "how will every household electrify dreams" During the assembly elections, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav came face to face
 mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ne apni chunavi reliyon main sapa sarkaar par aarope jadaa tha ki mandiron main to bijli aati nahin jabaki dargahon ko 24 ghante bijli milti he
 Akhilesh also challenged Yogi and said that Baba should show him by holding an electric wire to know whether the electricity is coming or not
 ab soobe main bhaajapa sarkaar banane ke baad adityanath kii sabase badi chunauti 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav se pehle har ghar main bijli pahunchane kii he
 To fulfill this electoral target of BJP, UP will need 22,000 MW of power after two years
 iske liye atirikt bijli kaa intjaam karne ke alaava vitaran network bhi durust karnaa hoga
 "the challenge is to provide more than one crore new connections to the government to deliver electricity to every household within two years," says Shailendra Dubey, chairman of All India Power Engineers' Federation
 iske alaava transmishan system sudhaarney ke liye badi sankhya main chote sab stesan or line bhi taiyaar karaani hongi" soobe main bijli vitaran kaa network durust karne ke liye pradesh sarkaar ko kam se kam 10,000 karod ru

 Senior BJP leader and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha has opened a front against the Modi government
 unhone sarkaar dwaara liye gaye aarthik faislon par sidhaa chot kiya he
 Yashwant Sinha says that if any wrong steps are taken in the interest of the country, then he will not sit silent against him
 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main yashavanth sinha ne aise 10 mudde uthaae jo sidhe modi sarkaar ke khilaaf he
 In such a situation, the government may find it difficult to answer these questions
 1
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is unable to give time to the Finance Ministry
 jis vajah se aarthik morche par sarkaar phisal rahi he
 2
 aaj ke daur main sarkaar ke faisle se kai netaa asahmat hai, lekin wo khulkar party kaa virodh nahin kar paa rahe hai
 3
 aarthik vikaas kii dar gir rahi he
 Recently, the figures of GDP are a matter of concern
 maine jetali ko kabhi hataane kii baat nahin kahi
 4
 desh garibi kii ore ja rahaa he
 The pace of economic development has derailed in the last year and a half
 aarthik rup se majboot desh hi swaavlambee ho saktaa he
 5
 ye jaruri nahin ki jayant sinha or mere vichaar ek jaise hon
 Both are part of a family, father-son relationship is private and not official
 6
 Since 1947, steps are being taken towards economic reforms in the country
 'new india' modi sarkaar kaa naaraa he
 7
 galat aarthik faislon ke baavjood chunaav jeetna alag baat he or sarkaar chalaanaa alag mudda he
 8
 piem modi ne kai aarthik sudhaaron ko kareeb se avlokan kiya he, jab wo gujarat ke mukhyamantri the, tab unhone bade aarthik faisle liye the
 Therefore it is wrong to blame them
 9
 Rapid changes in policies are also being done by RSS
 hamaare daur main RSS kii sarkaar main bhoomika alag thi or ab alag he
 10
 agar modi sarkaar ko dobaaraa 2019 main satta main vaapasi kerani he to arthvyavastha ko patari par laana sabase jaruri he or rojgaar srijan par teji se dhyaan dena hoga

 Amid tensions in Kashmir, a picture is going viral on social media depicting Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a monster and also written "dracula of Modi Kashmir"
 kai logon ne is tasviir ko share kiya or likhaa ye uttarapradesh ke aligarh muslim uniwarsity (AMU) kii he
 What is the claim? Facebook user Shardendu Tripathi uploaded the poster and wrote "this picture showing Modi ji as Dracula is being told of Aligarh Muslim University, it is an insult to the entire country, it is not freedom of expression, betrayal of democracy of the country
" , Which has elected its Prime Minister with a strong majority
 asal main jab tak aligarh muslim university or uski tarah anek sansthaanon kaa muslim states rahegaa ye aisi harkate karte rahenge , bharat jaise dharm nirpeksh desh main dharmik algaavvaad kii koi jarurat nahin in sansthaanon kaa charitra badal do, vahaan ke jihadi professors ko jabaran ritairement do, vahaan rashtravaadiyon kii niyukti karo

 ”iskaa archived varjanayahandekha ja saktaa he
 While commenting on this post, people are demanding action against AMU
 kai or fasebuk yuzars ne ispostco bhi aplod kiya he
 What is the truth of the picture? India Today anti-fake News War Room (AFWA) found that this poster was used not in India but in London
 india today anti phek news war room ne is poster par likhe shabd “modi kashmir kaa drakula” internet par search kiya to paaya kii darasal jammu-kashmir se dhara-370 ko nishprabhavi karne ke baad 15 agast ko landan main bhartiya ucchayog ke saamne pradarshan yojit kiya gaya tha
 Many people took photos and videos on social media at the same time
 is maamle main landan main chaar logon kii giraftaar bhi hui or isse judi khabaryahaanpadhi ja sakati he
 We spoke to AMU spokesperson Omar Salim Pirzada who said, "this is a nefarious attempt to discredit the students of Aligarh Muslim University
" yahaan aisi baton ko bardaasht nahin kiya jaataa or yahaan ke chaatro ko bhi ye pataa he
 In our own investigation, it has been revealed that the man who uploaded the photo has nothing to do with Aligarh Muslim University
 wo dilli se he
 We are exploring legal possibilities under which action can be taken against those spreading such rumors
 ”aligarh police ne bhi vishvavidhyalay parisar main aisi kisi poster lagane se inkaar kiya he
 The conclusion is that Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to spread confusion about the poster with Dracula, it has nothing to do with Aligarh Muslim University
 ye poster landan main lagaaye gaye the jise soshal media par aligarh kaa bataaya gaya

 aupchaarik shiksha se jo phayda or takat milti he, main use kam kar ke nahin aank rahaa
 Along with speeding up the learning process, formal education gives you a chance to network and also highlight the dimensions of personality

 i was obsessed with thoughts and enthusiasm, so did not want to get caught up in studies

 At the beginning of my journey, i found that more than just enthusiasm and personal inspiration, i needed more to turn my idea into a real business

 As part of the Skill India scheme, we aim to train around three lakh employees in 150 cities over the next three years

 narendra modi or nitish kumaar, siyasat kii nadi ke do kinare
 There is a competition to beat each other
 modi ne patel kii murti ko duniya kii sabase oonchi stachu banane kaa elaan kiya to bhala nitish kaise peeche rahete
 Nitish attacked not only Modi but also the BJP
 duniya kaa sabase bada ramamandir bihar ke champaran main banane kaa elaan kar diya
 The Virat Ramayana temple will be 2,800 feet long, 1,400 feet wide and 410 feet high
 ye mandir cambodia ke ankorwat mandir kii tarj par banegaa lekin usase kai guna bada
 However, it will take 10 years to build this temple and it is estimated to cost Rs 500 crore
 mauka viraat ramayana mandir kaa model dikhaane kaa tha lekin siyasat karne se nitish nahin chuke
 Nitish Kumar was present at the Mahavir temple in Patna with Shankaracharya Swaroopananda
 yun to nitish kumaar bhagavadhariyon se bachate hai lekin mauka modi ko jabaab dene kaa tha, so nitish kumaar kahaan chukne vaale the
 So, on this occasion, the party's line was cleared on the Ram temple issue
 nitish ne ramayana mandir par safai di to saath maujuud swami swaroopanand ne patel kii murti ke bahaane bijepi kii hindutv kii paribhaana par nishaanaa saadhaa
 Modi is demanding iron from the farmers for the statue of Patel, but Nitish also defeated Modi here and did not ask for donations for the construction of the temple
 yani mandir to ek bahaanaa he, asal baat to siyasat ke khel main modi ko neeche giraanaa he

 The RSS has put in full force to fulfill Narendra Modi's 'mission 272', this is well known
 lekin sangh kii ranneeti aakhir he kya? darasal, sangh ke kaaryakarta deshbhar main fail gaye hai or in kaaryakartaaon kaa target he 'booth jito'
 By the way, there is so much work in the social and cultural field of RSS that campaigners and activists do not get the time to breathe
 puure saal ke liye sab ke kaarykram tay hote hai
 But everything has stopped for these workers now, because they have got a new target
 ye target he bijepi ke piem ummidavaar narendra modi ke mishan 272+ ko puraa karnaa
 Actually, the Sangh has played a role in making Modi a PM candidate and making his mission a success
 sarasanghachaalak ne pichley saal elahabaad ke kubh main hi elaan kar diya tha ki jo logon kii bhaavana he, wo sangh kii bhaavana he
 That is why even though Modi has written the entire script, the role of the Sangh remained to suppress the tone of protest
 ab bengalooru kii aresas kii rashtriya kaarysmiti kii baithak main to modi ko piem banane ke mishan kaa khaakaa bhi taiyaar ho gaya or kaaryakartaaon kii tainaati bhi ho gai
 If sources are to be believed, the target of the Sangh workers is- 'win the booth
 ' to ye rahaa iskaa matlab
 
 
 1
 desh ke har gaanv main ek kaaryakarta maujuud rahe
 Sangh workers should be present at every booth level as far as possible
 2
 In each state, the province campaigners have been given an offline tab, which has the details of every parliamentary constituency in their state and the information of each village
 3
 Electoral rolls have been delivered to every booth level RSS worker
 har kaaryakarta ke upar 200 gharon kii jimmedaari he or unhen na sirf in gharon ke sampark main rahanaa he, balki unhen ghar se boothon tak laane kaa kaam bhi karnaa he
 4
