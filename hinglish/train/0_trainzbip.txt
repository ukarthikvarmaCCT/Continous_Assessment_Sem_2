 They allege that the people injured in the previous shootings were rushed to jail on the pretext of treatment by the police
 aisa hi phir se na ho
 Tension has remained in the area since the incident
 rajdhani dilli main nagar nigam mukhyalay or desh kii sansad ke bich kii duuri nammaatr kii he
 Perhaps that's why BJP leader LK Advani gave a source at the conclusion of the Jan Chetna Yatra at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi: "delhi's victory is necessary to continue the war against corruption as Delhi's message will go to the country
" ''yahi sutara bhaajapa kii 2013 ke semifinal or 2014 ke final kii ladaai main aage badhane kaa pehla mantra ban gaya
 The Congress' debacle in the three corporations in the Delhi Municipal Corporation election has raised the bjp's spirits
 congress ise sthaneey chunaav bataakar bhale khiz nikaal rahi ho lekin 2012 main uttar pradesh, punjab, goa vidhansabha or mumbai main biemasi chunaav ke baad yah congress kii lagaataar paanchavin badi haar he, jo uske khilaaf janata ke badhate rashtravyapee aakrosh kii jhalak dikhaati he
 The defeat of the Congress in the two largest metros of the country, delhi-mumbai, has deep political implications
 yah congress ke prati padhe-likhe madhyavarg kii naaraazgi ko dikhaata he
 The results of the Delhi Municipal Corporation elections are a warning bell for the Congress, but there is a message for the BJP, steeped in excesses of enthusiasm, because it is more excited about the Congress's defeat at the moment than its victory
 teenon nagar nigamon kii 272 siton main se bhaajapa ke khate main kul 137 siten ain, jo pichhali baar ke mukaable 27 siten kam he, lekin teen main do nigam uttari or purvi main party ko bahumat mila, to dakshin main vah sabase badi party banakar ubhari
 The main reason for bjp's celebration was to break the myth in the corporation elections and win it for the second time in a row
 uske varchasv ko todane ke liye dilli kii shila dikshit sarkaar ne tamaam virodhon ke baavjood nigam ko na sirf apane adheen kiya, balki uske teen tukade kiye
 But this time the charisma of Chief Minister Dixit, who has been waving the Assembly for three times, did not work
 lekin is haar se nikali maayusi ne 10 janpath ko bhi apni agosh main le liya he
 The anger of the people against corruption and inflation has shown in this election, so Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is leading the Congress in the government, was also seen giving clarification
 haalanki ve bhi ise sthaneey muddon par ladaa gaya chunaav maanate hai
 They say, "we accept defeat
 emsidi ke chunaav sthaneey muddon par lade jate hai or jo log janata ke liye kaam karte hai, unheen kaa kaam myne rakhata he
 There is a win-win in every election, everyone should accept it with good spirit
 ''haalanki congress khud ko yah kahkar dilasa de sakati he ki pichhali baar ke mukaable chaar siton kaa ijapha hua he, lekin shila sarkaar ke mantriyon or unke saansad putr sandip dikshit samet sabhi haiviveet saansadon ke ilaake main party buree tarah se haari he
 Keeping aside its surveys, the Congress had selected the candidates solely with the opinion of mps and mlas
 14 saal se dilli par raaj kar rahi congress kii haalat kitni post he, iskaa andaja isse lagaaya ja saktaa he ki shila sarkaar ke ek mantri ashok walia ke vidhansabha kshetra main congress kaa khaataa bhi nahin khulaa, to teen mantri harun yusuf, kiran walia or ramakant goswami ke kshetra main party ek hi seat jeet pai
 Rajkumar Chauhan gave two seats in his area and Arvinder Singh Lovely gave three seats in four
 jis purvi dilli se shila ke bete sandip or pradesh congress adhyaksh jaiprakash agarwal saansad hai, vahaan 64 main se congress mahaj 19 siton par hi jiti
 Whereas Sheila, who focused on the development of East Delhi in the Commonwealth Games, was expecting this corporation
 itnaa hi nahin, pichhali baar chunaav haar chukin congress kii chaatr netaa amrutha dhawan ko chhodkar kisi bhi chaatr netaa kii nahin chali
 After this defeat, the head-foot in the Congress has started
 purv meyar farhaad suri ne jeet darrj karne ke fouran baad aarope lagaaya ki ilaake ke vidhayak tarvinder singh marwaah ne unhen haraane ke liye koi kasar nahin chodi thi
 Former BJP national president M
 venkaiya naidu kehete hai, ''shila dikshit kaa jaadu ab khatm ho chukaa he
 People are now considering Dixit as a tired leader
 '' lekin dikshit ise apni haar maanane se inkaar karti hai
 She says, "it was not my election, it was the MCD election
" jab hamaare vidhansabha ke chunaav aaenge, tab dekhenge
 "despite denying the mood of the public, she refuses to take responsibility for the defeat and also throws up the number of Congress seats and increase in vote percentage compared to last time
" dhyaan rahe ki haal hi uttar pradesh main karaari shikast ke baad sabase pehle congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi ne haar kii jimmedaari lee thi, jabaki vahaan bhi party kii siten 22 se badhkar 28 ho gayi thi
 This is Sheila Dikshit's moment when she is included as an important member in the Antony Committee set up to review the defeat in the recent assembly elections
 aise main congress haar kaa vishleshan kitni eemaandaaree se karegi, samajhna mushkil nahin
 The people of Delhi had hinted at joining Anna Hazare and Swami Ramdev's movement against corruption and inflation, but then Union ministers and Congress leaders tried to crush the movement by showing arrogance
 haalanki chunaav nateezon ke fouran baad sandip kii tippanee thi, ''anna ke andolan ke kaaran aisa maahaul bana ki congress hi sari galatiyon kii jad he
 The Congress was defeated due to disconnection from the people and taking advantage of inflation from the BJP
 '' lekin nateezon ke baad 24 ghante tak sadame main raheen shila ne jab pratikriya di, to apane bete kii tippanee ko hi jhuthalane kii koshish kii
 She was seen asking the opposite question, "is there no inflation in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat?" Municipal corporation elections have nothing to do with inflation
 '' ve bhrashtachar ke sawaal par bhi bhadakin, ''kya emsidi main bhrashtachar nahin he? kya bhaajapa bedaag he?'' haalanki unki is tippanee par bhaajapa netaa venkaiya naidu chunauti dete hai, ''shila dikshit ke paas koi jaankaree thi yaa he, to use janata ke bich kyon nahin uthaaya? kyon nahin sabit karke dikhaati hai
 Like the Congress, the BJP too does not see this outcome as related to the Anna movement
 bhaajapa ke rashtriya adhyaksh nitin gadakari kehete hai, ''mahangaai or bhrashtachar ke khilaaf jo bhi andolan hue, janata khud unase jud gai
 As far as Anna influence is concerned, it is also a fact that Sharad Pawar's party NCP emerged victorious in his village in the district panchayat elections
 '' bhale hi bhaajapa-congress raajnneetik majaburiyon se anna prabhaav ko khaarij karen, lekin yah tathy he ki mahangaai or bhrashtachar ne dilli samet desh bhar main congress ke khilaaf maahaul bana diya he
 Issues like the recently increased service tax in the budget, the nationwide strike of bullion traders, parents' trouble in Delhi's school admissions and the ever-increasing prices of petrol also became the immediate reasons for the Congress's defeat in the Corporation elections
 dilli main privet sector ke logon kii taadaad badi he, lekin aarthik mandi ke daur main vetan main ijapha nahin hua
 On the other hand, the Sixth Pay Commission gave some relief to the government employees from inflation
 udhar sarkari karmchaariyon ke vetan main hui badhotaree ko aadhaar banaakar shila dikshit ne kai baar mahangaai ko jaij tehraane kii koshish kii
 Which made the salt work on the wounds of the people working in the private sector
 anna-ramdev andolan ke vakt sarkaar kaa cheharaa bane or us par tikhe hamale karne vaale kendriya mantri kapil sibbal kehete hai, ''nigam chunaav sthaneey muddon par lade jate hai, is chunaav ke nateezon ke peeche congress ke khilaaf hawa banane jaisi koi baat nahin he
 The Congress' frustration is also reflected in the different statements of their leaders
 rajya congress ke prabharee mahasachiv choudhary birendra singh kii daleel he, ''hamane sthaneey muddon par focus kiya, jabaki bhaajapa ne rashtriya muddon par
 At the same time, the national president of the BJP also entered the election campaign
 '' duusari ore shila sarkaar ke mantri arvinder singh lavali kaa aarope he, ''bhaajapa logon ko bhramit karne main safal rahi, use bataanaa chahie ki paanch saal main usne kya kiya?''congress main maayusi kaa alam he to bhaajapa main jashn kaa daur abhi thama nahin he
 "this victory has boosted the morale of the cadre and created an atmosphere for the assembly elections," Gadkari admits
 '' nigam main congress haari jarur he lekin ise puri tarah se bhaajapa kii jeet nahin kaha ja saktaa
 BJP seats have decreased compared to last time
 in nateezon kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki jitani sankhya main congress parshad (78) jitkar aae hai, kamobesh utane hi nirdaleey or anya dalon ke parshad (57) chunakar aae hai
 With nearly 10 per cent of the vote, the BSP remains the third party in Delhi
 isse saaf he ki janata ne bhaajapa ko nahin, balki apane ilaake main congress ko haraane kii takat rakhane vaale ummidavaaron ko vot diya
 Delhi elections are considered a referendum for Mini India
 par yah saaf ho chukaa he ki desh main is vakt congress ke khilaaf ek lahar he or jahaan-jahaan jo majboot vikalp dikh rahaa he, janata use jita rahi he
 Dadasaheb Phalke Chitranagri, ie, Film City, will be made world class, located in Goregaon near Mumbai
 is par 2550 karod rupe kharch honge
 For this, the Maharashtra government is looking for a global private partner and has also tendered it
 sanyogvash, isamen kisi global company to aage nahin ai he lekin mukesh ambani kii reliance industries limited (ariel), anil ambani kii reliance big intertenment (arabii) or bhanot infraventure (biivi) ne apni sharton ke saath dilchaspee dikhaai he jis par tender cameti ko faisla lenaa he
 Chandrakant Kolekar, deputy engineer of Maharashtra Film, Stage and Cultural Development Corporation Limited (MFSCDC), said that the master plan for Film City has been prepared and accordingly it has to be made world class
 ise paanch saal main puraa karnaa hoga
 The private partner who redevelops filmcity will get a 50-year stake in its revenue
 iske baad phir tender ke jariye nae partner kii talash kii jaaegi
 However, Kolekar has refused to divulge the terms of the three companies that have shown interest
 filmacity ke upaadhyaksh amarjit mishra kaa kahana he ki rajya ke mukhyamantri devendra fadanvis kii yah mahatvakankshi yojana he jise ve mek in india kii tarj par puri karana chaahate hai
 In such a situation, an Indian company may get an opportunity to redevelop Filmcity
 unhone kaha ki bollywood mumbai main he jis vajah se film city bade paryaton sthal ke rup main ubhar rahaa he
 It will be made a world class tourist destination like Universal Studios which will also provide economic benefits
 1977 main nirmit or 521 acre main faile film city kii is samay vaarshik aamadani lagbhag 70 karod rupe he
 But after its redevelopment, its revenue may increase manifold
 haalanki, film city ke upaadhyaksh mishra sweekaar karte hai ki film city main is samay aakarshan centre kam hai or aamadani ke strot bhi kam hai
 Hence its redevelopment is needed
 master plan bhi usee nazariye se taiyaar kiya gaya he jise rajya sarkaar ne manyata de di he
 According to this master plan, facilities for shooting and post production will be increased
 iske liye nae aadhunik studio, puraane studio kaa punarvikas, maharashtra kii samskruti par aadhaarit gaanvon kaa nirmaan, railway stesan, bas stesan, outdoor shooting sthal ke alaava pre or post production ke liye aadhunik suvidhaayen or atyaadhunik vijual effects ke studio banaae jaaenge
 To promote tourism, there will be museums of Bollywood and Marathi films
 yahaan kanveshan centre, paanch sitara, teen sitara, kam bajet ke hotalon ke saath dormetary or club house kii bhi suvidhaayen rahegi
 Film City officials admit that there has been a lack of state-of-the-art facilities for shooting and post production for almost two decades
 baavjood iske 15 studio, aath gaanvon ke lokation or 40 outdoor lokation par shooting hoti rahati he
 But with time the film and serial makers get state-of-the-art facilities, then shooting and post production work will be more and income will also increase
 *** The Congress is upbeat with the victory of the Grand Alliance-backed RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan in Kairana, Uttar Pradesh
 2019 main hone vaale aam chunaav ke liye congress bijepi ke har ummidavaar ke khilaaf mahagathbandhan samarthit ek ummidavaar utaarne ko lekar taiyaari kar rahi he
 According to sources, the Congress is also talking to all opposition parties regarding this
 haalanki,congreska yah formula bihar main pichley 3 saalon se lagu he
 During the 2015 Bihar assembly elections, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar formed a grand alliance with the Congress and fielded only one leader of the grand alliance against every candidate of BJP, the result of which was in front of everyone
 bihar vidhansabha upachunaav main mahagathbandhan ko baari jeet mili or bijepi aundhe munh giri
 Regarding the new initiative of the Congress after the victory of the Grand Alliance-backed candidate in Kairana, RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said, 'this formula has been in force in Bihar since 2015 and now there is a need for opposition parties to work on this formula in other states of the country
 'mrityunjay tiwari ne kaha, 'bihar vidhansabha chunaav ke dauraan voton ke bantwaare ko rokane ke liye jo mahagathbandhan bana tha vah kaaphi kargar sabit hua tha, jisaki vajah se bijepi ko chunaav main baari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 'RJD believes that if the Congress formulas are adopted by the opposition parties of all the states, then the BJP will have no place in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 mrityunjay tiwari ne kaha, 'voton ke bantwaare kii vajah se hi 2014 main bijepi kii jeet hui thi magar pichley kuch upachunaavon ke dauraan jahaan-jahaan mahagathbandhan ekajute hua he or bijepi ke khilaaf keval ek ummidavaar ko utaara, vahaan bijepi kii haar hui
 RJD said, 'A message has come out of Kairana which all opposition parties should understand so that the grand alliance on the lines of Bihar should be made in all the states
 ' haalanki, bijepi kii sahyogi dal jediu ne kaha, 'congress kaa yah formula jamini hakeekat nahin ban saktaa he, kyonki congress hameshaa se hi chote dalon ko dabaakar apana varchasv banaakar rakhane main vishwaas karti he
 JDU spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan said, "on one side, the Congress does not give small parties a chance to grow up
" vahiin duusari taraf kshetreey dal bhi parivaarwaad se baahar nahin nikal pate hai
 'rajiv Ranjan believes that for this reason the Congress' formula to field only one candidate against the BJP is only airborne

 a Delhi court has issued a non-bailable warranty against reality show 'bigg Boss' contestant Swami Om in a theft case registered by his brother
 mukhya metropolitan magistrate (siemem) satish kumaar aroda ne omaji ko agali sunwaayee kii taarikh teen disambar ko pesh hone kaa aadesh dete hue giraftaar warrant jari kiya or unki jamaanat or muchalke kii raashi bhi jabt kar lee he
 CMM said, 'even after repeated orders, the accused did not appear

 Despite Nitish Kumar being the Chief Minister of Bihar for 13 years, it is a picture of Bihar, which makes him a state with many chaos
 pichley paanch saal ke dauraan yahaan (nitish ke rajnatik 'dalbadal' ke alaava) kuch bhi nahin badla he, jisase matadaata kah saken, haa, yah shaks hamen raamarajy kii taraf na sahi, acchhee zindagi kii taraf ek kadam bhi le ja rahaa he

 vah kehete hai ki vah congress ko vot denge, kyonki ek 'buudhe' shaks kii tulana main ek yuva kaa incharge hona behatar he
 In Bihar, a complete ban was imposed on the sale of liquor in April 2016
 chaahe gaanv ho yaa shahar, lagbhag har shaks is baat se sahamat he ki sharabbandi ke baad uskaa milanaa nahin rukaa he, bas, bahut-se log rais ho gaye hai
 Although they believe that some women are happy with this decision, but according to one student, what is the use of it, 'when all is secretly and secretly, just, the prices have gone up

 Lalu Yadav has been sentenced to six years in the corruption case in 2017 (file photo) even though he complains a lot, and looking at his villages shows that he has many reasons for the complaints, but Caste is the biggest basis for voting
 lagbhag sabhi yadav lalu prasad yadav kii laalaten ko vot dene kaa vaada kar rahe hai
 They believe that Lalu may have done something wrong, but the punishment he received for it - being convicted and imprisoned - is overdue
 unke liye, 19 may ko aakhri charan ke matdaan ke dauraan laalaten zarur jalani chahie
 But even in this small group of Yadavs, three youths say that they will vote for Modi, for which even their neighbors reprimanded them in friendly tone, but they remained adamant
 unamem se ek niraj kumaar kahata he, "modi badlaav laa rahe hai, khaastaur se sheersh par, or jo bhrashtachar hamaare yahaan he, vah apratyaksh he
 
 
 This means that it does not go to the top, only local

 But support for Modi has not diminished

 For this reason, Nitish Kumar, who has managed to convince BJP to fight on equal seats (17) in the alliance, is also seen fighting with the help of Modi
 sasaram or baxur main modi kii badi-badi reliyon ke baad apni raily ke liye nalanda pahunche nitish bheed kaa aakaar dekhakar zarur niraash hue honge
 In 2014, when he was losing, he gathered more crowds at this place

 Tejashwi also felt more easily connected with Nitish than he did
 aisa lagata he, tejasvi bhavishya main bahut aage jaaenge
 In the Modi versus Sesha scenario, the figures are in favor of Modi
 nitish kumaar ko 17 siten dekar amit shah ne paanch aisi siten de di hai, jo ve 2014 main jite the, or aath anya siten bhi
 But due to this kind of agreement, the alliance has fought in most seats with more than 45 percent vote share, which can be a big benefit
 bhale hi kuch siton par NDA ko jati, bhrashtachar or sharabbandi kii vajah se sangharsh karnaa pad saktaa he, mote taur par vipaksh hi unhen haraane ke liye sangharsh karata rahegaa

 Following the controversial incident, former President Pranab Mukherjee attended a program of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) earlier this month
 lekin unke shaamil hone kaa phayda RSS ko ab hota dikh rahaa he
 According to the Sangh, since Mukherjee joined, a large number of people from West Bengal want to join the RSS
 rashtriya swayan sevak sangh (aresas) ke varisht netaa biplab roy ne kaha ki nagpur main 7 june ko mukherjee ke bhaashan ke baad sanghathan main shaamil hone ke liye sangh ko logon kii taraf sekai aavedan milehain
 Roy said, 'between June 1 and June 6, on an average, we used to receive 378 requests daily on our website' Join RSS '
 lekin saat june ko hamaare shiksha varg ko mukherjee ke sambodhit karne ke baad se hamen 1779 aavedan mili hai
 After 7 June, we are receiving 1200-1300 requests daily
 ’badi baat yah he ki pranab mukherjee ke grih rajya pashchim bengal main sanghathan main shaamil hone kaa anurodh karne vaale logon kii sankhya main badhotaree hui he

 This is one of his reasons
 ’sangh ke manch se 'dada kii class'sangh ke manch se pranab mukherjee ne kaha tha, 'main yahaan par raashtra, rashtrawaad or deshbhakti samajhane aayaa hum

 If you want to set up a factory to make a modest USB drive, which is so imported from China that the details of the government's Make in India were also given to journalists in a pen drive made in China, then to gain the land, you will need Will have to deal with the same law, which according to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is not suited to the needs of the twenty-first century
 alabatta agar aap sarkaar ke saath milakar express-ve, industrial park athwa lagjri hotel-hospital bananaa chaahate hai to nae adhyadesh ke mutabik, aapako kisaanon kii sahmati yaa pariyojna ke jeevika par asar ko aankane kii sharton se maafee mil jaaegi
 This is the hallmark of the debate that has emerged from the margins of the grand events of Vibrant Gujarat and Bengal and is not ready to be bogged down in imaginary figures of investment
 ise menuphaccharing banaam infrastracchar kii bahes samajhane kii galati mat kiijie, kyonki bharat ko donon hi chahie
 The question is, who should get priority in the easy supply of land, the manufacturer who provides continuous employment or "bob the builder" who provides daily employment? Under Make in India, technology, manufacturing that brings innovation, or a toll road, to developers who cut colonies? Lands are complex resources
 ek ke liye yah vishuddh jeevika he to duusare ke liye pariyojna kaa kaccha maal he jabaki kisi tisare ke liye jaminen munaafe kaa buniyadi formula ban jaati hai
 The new land acquisition law and the drastic changes in it have upset the balance of these three interests
 puraane kanoon (1894) ke tahat manamaane adhigrahan hote the jinamein kisaanon ko paryaapt muaavja bhi nahin miltaa tha
 The previous government, with the consent of Viphan, ensured the compensation of the 21st century in the new law, but the new law was focused on the politics of the farmers, so the supply of land for development was halted
 bijepi ne adhyadeshi badlaavon se kanoon ko jis tarah udaar kiya he usase phaayde chuninda niveshkon kii ore mukhaatib ho rahe hai, jisase jatiltaaon kii jameen or kadical ho jaaegi
 Apart from farming, there are two models of productive use of land
 ek buniyadi dhaancha pariyojnaayen he jahaan jameen hi kaarobaar va munaafe kaa buniyadi aadhaar he
 The second is customer manufacturing, where land for investors is part of the cost of the project, as factory profits are dependent on technology and competition
 sadak, bijli, awaas, airport kii buniyadi bhoomika or jarurat par koi vivaad nahin ho saktaa lekin sweekaar karnaa hoga ki sarkari nitiyaan infrastracchar granthi kii shikaar bhi hai
 Most debates of economic development begin with a lack of infrastructure
 riyaayaton, karj suvidhaon or pariyojnaon main sarkaar kii sidhi bhagidaari (pipipi-sarkari guarantee jaisaa he) kaa dulaar bhi mahaj ek darjan udyog yaa sevaaon ko miltaa he
 The preference of the government is also the preference of banks, therefore, huge debt is stuck in infrastructure and PPP projects
 sanshodhit bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon se jameen kii supplai main aasaani hogi lekin sirf infrastracchar udyogon ke liye
 In these industries, it is possible to earn profits from the land purchased by paying four times the price, because there is an infinite scope for the commercial use of land in building houses, airports and expressways etc
 alabatta menuphaccharing udyog ke liye sasti jameen to dur, unhen vah sabhi sharten manani hongi, jinase infrastracchar develper ko mukti mil gai he
 There are already facilities and concessions for infrastructure, enthusiasm for manufacturing has increased after Modi's Make in India campaign
 menuphaccharing sthaayee or prashikshit rojgaar laati he jabaki construction udyog dainik or akushal shramik khapaata he
 Investors were assuming that the government was serious about permanent jobs, so manufacturing would get a boost
 dhyaan rakhana jaruri he ki menuphaccharing ke daayre main saikadon udyog aate hai jabaki jin udyogon ke liye kanoon udaar hua he, vahaan mutthi bhar badi companiyaan hi hai
 Therefore, the allegations of the benefit of the changes in favor of select industries and companies will increase
 bijepi kii mushkil yah he ki pichley bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon main kai badlaav sumitra mahajan, vartmaan loksabhaa adhyaksh, ke netritv vaali sansadeey samiti kii sifarish se hue the
 From the all-party meetings to the Parliament, the new amendments are contrary to the new land acquisition law that the BJP has actively advocated
 congress sarkaar ne nae kanoon par sarvadaleey sahmati banaai thi, bijepi ne to in samvedansheel badlaavon se pehle siyaasi taapmaana parakhane kii jarurat bhi nahin samajhi
 In fact, the Modi government has missed an opportunity to rationalize the Land Acquisition Act
 menuphaccharing sahit anya udyogon ko isamen shaamil kar kanoon ko vyaavhaarik banaaya ja saktaa tha taaki rojgarparak nivesh ko protsaahan miltaa
 As such, infrastructure requires extensive and outright acquisition of land which takes time
 menuphaccharing ke liye jameen kii aapurti badhaakar rojgaar srijan ke sahare virodh ke maukey kam kiye ja sakate the
 Congress enacted a new law and BJP changed it, ignoring the fact that maximum productive use of land is very important
 congress kaa bhoomi adhigrahan kanoon, vikaas kii jaruraton ke mafik nahin tha lekin bijepi ke badlaavon ke baad yah na to mek in india ke mafik rahaa he or na kisaanon ke
 The Land Acquisition Act belongs to the 21st century but neither the farmers nor the majority industries are with it
 ab aane vaale maheenon main jaminen vikaas or rojgaar nahin, sirf raajnneeti kii fasal paidaa karengi
 Madhya Pradesh Industries Minister Kailash Vijayvargiya termed Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh as a comedian and said that just as films have a comedian role for entertainment, Digvijay Singh is playing a role in the Congress to remain in the news
 nijee pravaas par harda aaye vijawargeey ne bhashaa se kaha ki singh kii baton par koi bhi zyada dhyaan nahin detaa he

 When asked about the statement made by Rajya Sabha member Raghunandan Sharma from BJP against the Chief Minister and ministers in Ujjain recently, Vijayvargiya said that these could be his personal views and his statement was "look somewhere, target somewhere"

 ' Discussion in Parliament is intensified as to why they are discussing the matter of giving 10 per cent reservation to the forward on the last day of the session
 jaahir he koi bhi is bill kaa virodh nahin kar saktaa isliye sabko milakar is bill ko paarit karana hi hoga
 But there is only one question in everyone's mind, what now
 
 
 loksabhaa kaa chunaav sir par he or kya aise or bhi maamle aane vaale hai jinke liye unako taiyaar rahanaa chahie?ji haa isi baat kii charchaa ho rahi thi sansad ke galiyare main saansadon ke bich
 People are now talking about the loss of profit on imparting 10 per cent reservation to the poor upper castes, whether this will change the fortunes of the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections or are there more arrows left, in Modi's quiver
 
 
 kai bijepi saansadon or yahaan tak ki kuch kendriya mantri bhi maanate hai ki is kanoon ke baad bijepi kaaryakartaaon main ek nayaa josh aayega, khaskar un kaaryakartaaon main jo rafel par rahul gandhi ke hamale se pareshaan the
 Some believe that with the passing of this bill, the Prime Minister's constantly falling graph will brake, things will start changing
 
 And the upper castes of Congress can be breached in Botbank
 ek bijepi saansad ne kaha ki dekho do dinon se koi rafel kaa naam bhi nahin le rahe hai
 But some mps of the opposition believe that the BJP is already doing well in the upper caste-dominated seats and it will not make much difference in those seats
 In contrast, in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Mandalist parties like RJD and Samajwadi Party will present it in the opposite way that it So the beginning is to end the reservation of backward and Dalits because the RSS has always been in favor of reservation on the economic basis and once again come The statement of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat will be cited in which he is seen advocating similar reservation
 magar sabase bada sawaal he ki savarnon kaa aarakshan hi ek turup kaa ikkaa tha jise modi ji ne apane pitare se nikaala yaa or bhi ho sakate hai
 Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad gave some idea of this in his Rajya Sabha speech in which he said that more sixes will be taken
 yadi sansad ke galiyare kii sunen to aglaa nayaa turup kaa ikkaa modi ji kii taraf se kisaanon ke liye aamadani badhaane kii yojana he
 Under this, direct transfer of money to farmers' accounts
 yani kisaanon ko har fasal kii buaai ke samay prati acre 4000 hajaar rupee die jaaenge
 This is a scheme which Chandrashekhar Rao has implemented in Telangana and in response the people sent him back to power with a big victory
 ab pradhanmantri modi isi kii tarj par desh bhar main kisaanon ke liye ise lagu karne kii yojana bana rahe hai
 After all, farmers have now become a big issue in the country, which Rahul Gandhi has taken up at the moment and Modi ji seems to be lagging behind
 yahi vajah he ki pradhanmantri ab peeche nahin hatana chaahate or is yojana kii ghoshnaa jald ho sakati he
 The second major decision will come in the budget in February
 yadi sansad ke galiyaaron main saansadon kii fusfusaahat ko sahi maane to sarkaar iskar ke slab main bade taur par badlaav laa sakati he
 By the way, the government was praising that so much tax has been collected and so much money has come to the treasury with the government
 isiilie kaha ja rahaa he ki sarkaar inakam tex kii seemaa 4 lakh tak badha sakati he
 
 
 This is not funny news
 
 Such news is a matter of relief for BJP mps on the last day of this session of Parliament, but opposition mps were still saying that nothing can happen now
 
 An opposition MP said that he had come very late
 
 Now all these mps have gone to their respective areas and will meet during the budget session in February

 These numbers of 'raazi' are also encouraging, because the film is heroine oriented
 film ne metro centres main acha pradarshan kiya he or iske baad verde of mouth ne bhi film ke fevar main kaam kiya he
 Anyway, 'raazi' is a spy drama in which Alia is playing the character of a girl who spies for India while staying in Pakistan
 tej gendbaaji kii jimmedaari or ek aakraamak captain kii aguai main khelte hue aisa hona swaabhaavik hi najar aata he
 Most experts do not deny that the fast bowler can leave his right effect only by staying in the passion, but according to him, the limit of senses cannot be crossed with being in the passion
 purv captain sunil gavaskar kehete hai ki team manjament ko viraat or khilaadiyon ko bataanaa chahie ki vah gusse kaa sahi istemaal karen
 He also believes that if the players score 50 or 100 runs or if a bowler takes a wicket, then they should be happy and not lose their advantage by getting angry
 gavaskar kehete hai ki aisa karne par vah game ke niyamon main funskar apana hi nuksaan karte najar aaenge
 The comments viraat purv captain dhoni se bilkul alag hai
 Also as a person and as a captain
 dhoni ranneeti ke taur par aakraamak cricket main bharosa rakhte the, to viraat har maukey par aakraamak khel ke jariye nattejey main bharosa rakhte hai
 Virat also says, "let the circumstances remain as they are, this is a chance to celebrate
 " With the formula of Virat, Team India has achieved great success, but what should be its limit
 yah lambey samay main hi tay ho sakegaa
 Former captain Sunil Gavaskar says that team management should tell Virat and the players to use anger properly
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki khilaadi 50 yaa 100 ran banaae yaa phir koi gendbaaj wicket le, to unhen khush hona chahie naa ki gussa hokar uskaa phayda ganvaa dena chahie
 Gavaskar says that by doing this, he will be seen doing his own harm by getting stuck in the rules of the game
 tippaniyan Virat is completely different from former captain Dhoni
 shakhsiyat ke taur par bhi or captain ke taur par bhi
 While Dhoni believed in aggressive cricket as a strategy, Virat believes in the result through aggressive play at every opportunity
 viraat kehete bhi hai, "halaat jaise hai vaise rahane dijie, yah mauka jashn manaane kaa he
 " viraat ke formule se team india ne badi kamyaabi hasil kii he, lekin isaki seemaa kya honi chahie
 It will be fixed in a long time
 viraat purv captain dhoni se bilkul alag hai

 The Australian team may have been the highest five-time champions in the ODI World Cup and they have achieved the status of the No
1 team in the world in Tests and odis, but the World T20 title has remained far away from this team
 yahi baat australian phans ke liye ek aisi tis bani hui he, jiskaa dard ye champion team baraabar mahasoos karti he
 Australian captain Steven Smith says, "this one trophy has been far from us
 ham saare toornament jeetna chaahate hai
 Our team is firm
 hamaare 15 khilaadi is toornament main dhamal kar sakate hai
 "this hunker before the fifth-ranked Australian team captain Steven Smith's World Cup can definitely boost his team's spirits
 duusari timen ise kitna tavajjo detii he, ye or baat he
 a special reason for the number five Australian team being freshly elevated in the ICC World T20 is that this team defeated a team like South Africa 2–1 on their own ground this month
 dakshin africa kii world ranking bhi australia se behatar he (1

 tippaniyan The Australian team is full of all-rounder players
 captain steven smith maanate hai ki tii-20 formet main olerounder khilaadiyon kaa hona match ke nattejey par ahm asar daal saktaa he
 Perhaps with these players, Captain Smith is planning to create history in India
 antarrashtriya tii-20 main australian team ne 84 main se 42 match yani 50 fisadi maichon main jeet hasil kii he or philhal ek sadhi hui team najar aa rahi he, lekin bharat ke haathon se ise apni hi jameen par haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 When the Indian and Australian teams hit the subcontinent's pitch (in Mohali on 27 March), the visiting team will surely feel the pressure of that defeat
 australian captain steven smith kehete hai, "ye ek trophy hamase dur rahi he
 We want to win all the tournaments
 hamaari team sadhi hui he
 Our 15 players can compete in this tournament
 " paanchavin ranking vaali australian team ke captain steven smith kii world cap se pehle ye hunkaar unki team kaa hausala jarur badha sakati he
 How much other teams favor it is another matter
 isisi world tii-20 main paanchaven number kii australian team ke hausale buland hone kii ek khaas vajah yah bhi he ki is team ne isi maheene dakshin africa jaisi team ko unheen kii jameen par 2-1 se shikast di he

 The biggest data breech of this year has been revealed
 ise log ab tak kaa sabase bada data brich bhi bataa rahe hai
 More than 77 crore email ids and passwords have been made public
 ye tamaam data file shering website par aplod kar die gaye or iskaa file sies 87GB he
 We have also given you ways to check how you can check whether your ID is hacked or not
 is maamle main idi hack hone kaa matlab ye nahin he ki aapaki idi koi doosraa yuj kar rahaa he
 Rather it means that someone has your ID and password somewhere
 sambhaavna he ki iskaa galat yuj kiya ja saktaa he
 But the biggest question is, how did this happen? Have you missed anything? Australian cyber security researcher Troy Hunt has created a stir in the digital space with this revelation
 unhone daawa kiya he ki karodon logon kii email idi or password mega naam kii file shering website par aplod kar di gai hai, jise baad main vahaan se hataa liya gaya
 These data are in 12,000 files, now it is not clear where this data came from nor has anyone taken responsibility for it
 kitna gambhir he ye maamalaye hack gambhir to he, lekin ise samajhnaa jaruri he
 Troy Hunt stated that 68 million uni emails are in address plane text
 lekin password kryptographicli haishes hai yani inhen yuj karnaa kaaphi mushkil he
 That is, no one can easily use it to open your email ID
 khatarnaak ye he ki ye data dark web nahin he, balki popular file shering website par aplod kiya gaya tha
 This is how to check, you have to know that your email ID is also included in this hack i
e
 if your password is also public, then you can enter your email ID by clicking on this link

 aise main is ap ko ek token diya jaataa he or yah aapke jimail acount se jud kar aapaki ditels letaa rahata he
 In this case, that app developer is easy to get your information and any hackers can target those apps and also take your password
 aap ek baar ko jimail par bharosa kar sakate hai, lekin un third party eps par bharosa kaise karenge jinhen aapane sirf isliye jimail kaa acces de rakhaa tha, kyonki aapako ek online quij khelnaa tha? yah ek udhaaharan he
 So there is a reason why your ID has been hacked

 What is going on and who is giving it to whom

 In Punjab, discord within the Aam Aadmi Party has begun to be seen
 vidhansabha main netaa vipaksh ke pad se hataae jane ke baad sukhpal khera ne punjab main party ko puri swatantraaa die jane kii maang uthaakar khulkar baghawat shuru kar di he
 On Thursday (2 August) a meeting of party supporters has been convened in Kosukhpal Khairane Bhatinda, in which Khaira supporters claim that most of the Aam Aadmi Party mlas in Punjab will accompany them
 punjab main baagiyon ke shakti pradarshan se pehle aam aadmi party ne punjabi unit ko sanket diya he ki aisi sthiti main vah baagiyon ke khilaaf kadi karrwai karegi
 Sisodia said: Anti-party activity: Aam Aadmi Party's Punjab in-charge Manish Sisodia has called this meeting to be held in Bathinda on August 2 as anti-party activity
 sukhpal khera ne soshal media par manish sisodiya ke is aadesh par naaraazgi jataate hue ise taanaashaahee ravaiya qaraar diya tha
 Khaira openly announced that the rally in Bhatinda on Thursday will put an end to this entire controversy simultaneously
 sukhpal khera ko hataae jane ke baad aam aadmi party ne party ke dalit vidhayak harpal seemaa ko punjab vidhansabha main netaa vipaksh niyukt kiya, jisko lekar sukhpal khera or unke gut ke vidhayak kanvar sandhu ne manish sisodiya ke saath hi baithak main iskaa virodh kiya
 Kanwar Sandhu had said that if the party wants to make Dalit a face in Punjab then why not make the state president a Dalit
 do guton main banty aapisa vivaad ke baad punjab main aam aadmi party do guton main bant gai he
 Aam Aadmi Party sources say that Sukhpal Khaira has four mlas in his favor, including Kanwar Sandhu
 aise main aam aadmi party kaa dilli netritv guuruuvaar ko bhatinda main hone vaali raily par apni najar banaai hui he
 Party sources say that strict action will be taken against all the leaders who attend this rally under anti-party activity, in which members can be suspended
 bhai khayrani saheli ke thik pehle soshal media par party ke mukhiya arvind kejariwal or punjab prabharee manish sisodiya se punjab ke logon or loktantr ke hit main party kii punjab unit ko puri takat dene kii maang uthaai
 At the same time, the Delhi leadership of the party feels that if its five mlas are rebel and form a separate faction, they will automatically lose their membership under the Defection Law
 isliye aam aadmi party kaa dilli netritv punjab main ho rahi is gatividhi ko lekar zyada chintit nahin he
 However, just before the Lok Sabha elections, the party is also preparing for such an open rebellion
 mana ja rahaa he ki khud mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal jaldi hi punjab kaa daura kar sakate hai or loksabhaa chunaav kii taiyaariyon kaa bigul phoonk sakate hai, lekin usase pehle party anushaasan kaa sabak sikhaane ke liye baagiyon par karrwai karne kii taiyaari kar rahi he
 Sukhpal Khaira has alleged that Sukhpal Khaira has alleged that many conspiracies are being made against him in the last 48 hours and it is being spread that he is in touch with the Akali Dal
 ye bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki bhatinda main hone vaali baithak ko kaamyaab karne ke liye congress hamaari madad kar rahi he
 Sukhpal Khaira said that he is doing these meetings only and only for the people of Punjab and their issues and to stop this, by spreading such rumors unnecessarily, an atmosphere is being created against him and his fellow mlas
 khera ne kaha ki unhen ashanka he ki agle 24 ghanton ke andar is tarah kii sajishein or bhi bad sakati hai
 Many types of photographs and social media posts can be tried to discredit them by making them viral
 or unke virdohi chaahate hai ki kisi bhi keemat par is baithak main baari bheed ikattha naa ho
 Sukhpal Khaira and Kanwar Sandhu have not named their own party's opponents and opposition parties
 unhone na hi ye bataaya he ki ye sajishein koun kar rahaa he
 But he has made it clear that this meeting is going to take place under any circumstances
 donon hi netaaon ne punjab ke logon or videshon main baithe NRI logon se apil kii he ki wo apane gaanv se baari taadaad main logon ko is baithak main bhejein or ise kaamyaab banaaen
 Sukhpal Khaira and Kanwar Sandhu did not speak against their opposing mlas and the Delhi high command within the party itself
 sukhpal khera ne kaha ki wo is baithak ke jariye apni party ke kaaryakartaaon ke man main uthe sawaalon or ashankaon kaa jawaab bhi manch se denge

 ab agra-lakhanu express-ve par nirdhaarit seemaa se zyada raftaar se gaadi chalaane par i-chaalaan kii vyavastha lagu kii gai he

 Leaders of BJP and JDU have gone so far in accusing each other that it is becoming difficult to differentiate between statements and abuses
 jediu ke diggaj netaa modi ko 'aatanki' qaraar dene main jaraa bhi hichak mahasoos nahin karte to bijepi netaa jediu or indian mujahidin ko ek hi thali kaa chatta-batta bataa rahe he
 Just think on the words of the leaders, it will be known that political anxiety has reached in Bihar
 bihar ke krishi mantri narendra singh ne narendra modi ko sabase bada 'aatanki' or 'khooni' qaraar diya to bijepi ke giriraaj singh ne ahmedabad main kaha ki 'nitish kumaar ne narendra modi ko maravane ke liye indian mujahiddeen ko set kiya tha
 Not only this, on Monday, senior BJP leader and former minister Ashwini Choubey cursed Nitish to go to hell and be born as a worm in the next life
 ye dono dal jab gaali galouj par utre to bhala argedy kahaan peeche rahati
 Rabri Devi described Narendra Modi as 'ravan' and Nitish as 'kansa'
 bijepi ne jab se modi kii raily main hue blast ke liye jab se nitish ke sir thikra phoda he
 JDU has started associating relations with the Indian Mujahideen, since then JDU has also started using words like terror, riot, balwai and murderer for Narendra Modi
 nitish kumaar ne bhi haal main ye kahkar sabko chaunkaa diya tha ki 'aatankiyon ne bijepi raily ko safal banaaya tha
 'actually when the BJP was in power with Nitish, all was well, but as soon as he came out of power, he has come down to curse him
 vahi haal jediu kaa he jo kal tak saath the to unhen bijepi ke log sadhu dikhte the lekin aaj aatanki najar aane lage hai

 During the hearing in the Supreme Court on the pils filed against it, the Center said that the new system is meant to strengthen the independence of the judiciary and not to weaken it

 The 121st Constitutional Amendment Bill and NJAC Bill 2014 brought in Parliament to appoint this commission are unconstitutional as they violate the basic structure of the Constitution

 Only a full-time body can appoint in a transparent manner, but the current commission is neither full-time nor transparent

 One man kept beating the other man with a leather belt

 Along with the belt, another man is attacking him with a stick

 Just as the video of his beating was being made, the video of this man is also being made
 is aadmi kii pitayee to isliye hui thi ki isane mobile churaayaa tha
 But this man has been beaten up
 wo bhi samajhie
 In fact, during the beating, the man abused the caste of the mobile stealer

 a Delhi court has upheld a six-month jail sentence in the case of molesting a medical science student in his chamber by an employee of an army hospital while giving this ruling

 Viral Acharya, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, has advocated the autonomy of banks
 acharya ne kaha ki sarkaar baikon ke saath 20-20 match khelnaa band kare, nahin to iske vinaashkari nattejey ho sakate hai
 Acharya's advice on the autonomy of banks is considered important at the same time as there is a stir in the Central Government's intervention in the CBI
 bainkon or mantriyon-netaaon ke gathjod kii aksar shikaayatein aati rahati hai
 Questions have also been raised about the relationship between politicians and bureaucrats with financial criminals who have fled abroad taking money from the growing npas and banks
 aise main bainkon ke liye 'aazaadee' kii maang uthaakar acharya ne jataane kii koshish kii he ki agar bank apane mutabik kaam karen to halaat sudhar sakate hai, varanaa vinaashkari parinaam ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 Acharya said at the AD Shroff Memorial Lecture, 'don't play 20-20 matches,' the central government, which does not value the independence of the central banks, has to suffer the wrath of financial markets
 mahatvapurn regulatory sansthaanon ko nazarandaaj karne kaa nateeja vinaashkari hota he
 'acharya further said, if independence is given to central banks, it has many benefits, such as it reduces the cost of debt, increases international investment and keeps the banks alive for a long time
 arabiai ke dipti governor kii yah baat isliye ahm maani ja rahi he kyonki aage kai rajyon main vidhansabha chunaav ke saath-saath 2019 main aam chunaav bhi he
 According to Acharya, decisions are being taken in the case of banks in a twenty-twenty match (in a hurry)
 acharya ne kaha, 'desh main hameshaa chunaav hote rahete hai
 Sometimes national, sometimes regional, sometimes medium
 chunaav najadik aate hi pehle kiye vaade puure karne kii jaldi bad jaati he
 Election Manifestos cannot be delivered by themselves, so it is expedited to implement populist options
 jabaki kendriya bank isse ulat test match khelte hai
 "the bad result of cheapening the debt," the governor said, "the government's focus beyond the government's twenty-twenty match is focused on winning the match, as well as staying in the next session so that the next match can be won
" byaaj dar ghataae jane ke sawaal par acharya ne kaha ki ise zyada ghataane par karj badhata he jo aage chalakaramhangaaika kaaran banataa he
 This may indicate strong economic growth in the short term, but further consequences may be bad
 iske chalate deergh avadhi main sandigdh nivesh, property kii keemton main giravat or vittiya sankat ke khatre jhelane pad sakate hai
 It is worth noting that RBI officials have recently said that the loan interest of some banks should be waived

 While giving a befitting reply to the parties which show fear of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to the Muslims, the party leader and party candidate from the city Murali Manohar Joshi said that the Muslims should not fear the BJP
 vah is desh ke rashtrabhakt naagarik hai or party kii jin-jin rajyon main sarkaar he vahaan hindu muslim dange nahin hote hai
 The BJP leader said these things in an interview
 unhone is baat kaa zikr karte hue ki atal bihari vaajapeyi kii sarkaar main kabhi bhi dange nahin hue, kaha ki musalamaanon ko bijepi se nahin balki allaah se darana chahie
 He claimed that the way the people of the country want change, it seems that the BJP is moving towards reaching the magic figure of forming a government on its own, but the party will remain with the nda's allies

 dastavej durust karaane main jute bangladeshiavaidh rup se kagajaat banavaa rahe logajab se uttar pradesh police ke mukhiya opi singh ne apane adhikariyon ko chitthee likhi he ki apane jile me avaidh rup se rah rahebangladeshiyon kii pahachanakaren, tab se soobe hadakamp much gaya he
 There is an atmosphere of tension in the areas where Bangladeshi are living secretly in many districts of the state
 aise kai log he jo naye sire se apane dastavej durust karaane main lag gaye hai or ve apane dastavejon ke bal par bharat main rahane kaa daawa kar rahe hai
 Suraj Dev Atal, president of the cleanliness organization UP, says that the special thing is that these Bangladeshi people live in different slums of the city and do everything from picking up garbage to cleaning
 inamen se zyaadaatar log khud ko assam se aayaa hua bataate hai lekin jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki ye log zyaadaatar bangladeshi hai or avaidh rup rishwat dekar aayam me kagajaat banavaakar yahaan or duusare jilon main rahete hai
 According to people, these people come to work here first and work very cheaply and make it difficult for the other people of India, according to the people, according to the rebel, Bangladeshi Mahamantri Swachh Sangathan and Municipal Corporation employees
 They also indulge in wrong business
 basti ke logon ke mutabizvaidh bangladeshiyon se samasyasirf suraksha kii nahin he balki inaki vajah se lakhanu main rah rahe aise karmchaariyon ko mushkil ho gayi he jo shahar me saaf safai se lekar kooda binane or jhaadu pochhe jaise kaam karte hai
 According to Suraj Dev Atal, president of the cleanliness organization UP, there are at least one lakh illegal Bangladeshi in UP capital of Lucknow
 dhire-dhire in logon ne jarurat ke kagajaat banavaa liye hai
 Assam is the strongest route for this
 jahaan se behad aasaani se aadhaar card, pan cord, or duusare dastavej ban jate hai
 No objection to verification
 Most people in the slums built in Lucknow are telling themselves of Assam and they say that they have been living here for a long time
 basti main rahane vaale sabhi logon ke paas abhi apane pahchaan patr nahin he lekin sabhi kaa maananaa he ki sarkaar NRC karwaae yaa kisi bhi tarah kii veriphication isamen unako aapatti nahin he lekin isaki aad main jo in logon ko dikkat or pareshaani hoti he use jald se jald khatm karnaa chahie
 People living in the settlement say that the institution and NGO working in the slums is also working with the government in this verification drive so that the correct information of the people can be seen
 usko apane paas jarurat ke mutabik rakhaa ja sake lekin jaise hi inako kisi vyakti vishesh pesh ho rahaa he
 They are immediately sending information to government agencies for their information, everyone believes that it will not be easy to drive out illegal Bangladeshi and other infiltrators living in the country until there is no public participation in this drive of the government
 parshad karyaalay main karmi or NGO ke mahaamantri rajesh baagi kaa kahana he ki sarkaar kii is koshish ko puraa karne ke liye upi police apni taiyaari kar chuki he, upi ke kai jilon me police ne apni veriphication drive shuru kar di he lekin saalon se avaidh rup se rah rahe or apane bharat ke nivasee hone ke tamaam saboot ikattha kar chuke in logon ko pahchaanana shaayad itnaa aasaan nahin hoga
