 Demonstration of students regarding the citizenship law PM Modi has done to the students of the college, against the Appellate Citizenship Amendment Act, demonstrations are being organized by students of all colleges and universities of the country including Delhi
 ise lekar pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki congress or uske saathi desh ke yuvaaon ko barbaad karne kaa ye khel khelnaa band kar den
 At the same time, PM Modi said that there is a conspiracy of Congress and Urban Naxal somewhere
 ye pichley 20 saal se hamaare peeche pade hai or lagaataar sajeesh kar rahe hai
 PM Modi said that i also urge the young colleagues of colleges and universities in the country to understand their importance and understand the importance of those institutions where you are studying
 sarkaar ke faislon or nitiyon ko lekar charchaa karen, dibet karen
 If you find something wrong, then perform it democratically, convey your point to the government
 ye sarkaar aapaki har baat, har bhaavana ko sunati, samajhati he
 He said that the Congress and its allies and some urban Naxalites are somewhere in the conspiracy
 congress or vampanthi dalon ke naam alag-alag hai or karname ek hi hai
 The Prime Minister said in the rally that because of this policy, divide and rule the Congress, the country has been divided once
 maa bharti ke tukade pehle ho chuke hai
 This is the Congress that illegally allowed millions of infiltrators to enter India, using them here in the name of vote bank
 unhone kaha ki ghuspaithiyon ke kaaran jo samasyaayein paidaa hui hai uske liebhi congress or uske saathi dal ye sab jimmedaar hai
 Let me make it clear again, the only treatise of the Government of India is the Constitution given by Baba Saheb Ambedkar
 
 
 hamaare liye ek hi mantra sarvopari he or ek hi mantra hamaari prerana he
 PM Modi said that the entire country rejected the negative thinking of this Congress and its allies
 lekin logon ko daraane ko, juthi baaten failaane ko unhone apni raajnneeti kaa aadhaar bana liya he
 By spreading lies and creating an atmosphere of fear, they are running on their old habits
 naagarikta sanshodhan kanoon ko lekar phir ye safed jhoothbolane lage hai, logon ko daraane lage hai
 The Congress, parties like it and its left ecosystem have given full force
 bataa den ki jharkhand ke sahibganj jile ke barhet main ek jansabha ko sambodhit karte hue pradhanmantri narendra modi ne kaha ki is baar har ore ek hi baat sunne ko mil rahi he
 
 
 Called Jharkhand
 
 
 bhaajapa dobaaraa
 He said that when the lotus flower blossoms, it is good for the poor, women, youth and the whole society
 congress par hamalaa karte hue piem modi ne kaha ki main aaj congress or unke saathi dalon ko khuleam chunauti detaa hum ki agar unamem himmat hai to wo khulkar ghoshnaa karen ki wo pakistan ke har naagarik ko bharat kii naagarikta dene ke liye taiyaar hai
 The country will settle their accounts
 piem ne kaha ki congress or uske saathiyon main agar saahas he to khulkar ye bhi ghoshnaa karen ki wo jammu-kashmir or ladakh main phir se artical 370 ko lagu karenge
 If you dare, they should also declare openly that the law against triple talaq will be repealed
 congress or iske saathi is chunauti ko sweekaar karen or khulkar ye elaan karen varanaa desh se jhooth bolnaa, bhram failaana or dusron ko apni dhaal banaakar ye gorilla raajnneeti karnaa band kar den
 Stop playing this game of ruining the youth of Congress and its allies
 piem modi ne kaha ki puure desh ne is congress or uske saathiyon kii nakaaratmak soch ko hi nakaar diya
 But to scare people, to spread false things, they have made the basis of their politics
 jhooth failaa kar or dar kaa maahaul banaakar hi wo apni puraani aadat ke bharose hi chal rahe hai
 These white lies have started lying about the Citizenship Amendment Act, scaring people
 piem modi ne kaha ki main puure desh ko, desh ke prayek naagarik ko chaahe hindu ho yaa muslim ko phir ye kahana chahta hum ki is kanoon se kisi bhi bhartiya naagarik kii naagarikta par koi asar nahin hoga
 The law that we have enacted has been made for people coming to India due to religious atrocities in three countries of our neighborhood
 ye un logon ke liye banaaya gaya he jo barason se bahut dayaneey sthiti main hai, jinke paas vaapasi kaa koi rasta nahin he
 He said that i want to ask where in the end is the violation of the rights of Indian Muslims, or any Indian citizen
 congress or uske saathi, is mudde par musalamaanon ko bhadakaane kaa, daraane kaa bhaybheet karne kaa prayaas karke apni raajnneetik khichdi pakaana chaahate hai
 The Citizenship Amendment Act does not take away the rights of any Indian, nor does it harm him in any way

 The comments eliana se pehle bollywood se mallika sheravat bhi jaiki chen ke saath film 'myth' main kaam kar chuki hai, magar mallika kii bhoomika bahut hi choti thi
 No one is so small that Mallika did any work in 'myth'
 to kya eliana ke saath bhi vaisaa hi hoga, jaisaa ki mallika ke saath hua tha? sutara bataate hai ki eliana ko 'kung phu yoga' main kaafii damdaar kirdaar mila he or wo jaiki chen kii tarah puri film main hongi

 Before Ileana, Mallika Sherawat from Bollywood has also worked with Jackie Chen in the film 'myth', but Mallika's role was very small
 itani choti kii kisi ko yaad bhi nahin ki mallika ne 'myth' main koi kaam kiya tha
 So will Ileana be the same as what happened to Mallika? Sources reveal that Ileana has got a very strong character in 'kung Fu Yoga' and she will be in the entire film like Jackie Chen

 However, during this time the father of these three kept telling his sons innocent and kept going round the door of the officers for months
 lekin kahin bhi inaki fariyaad nahin suni gai
 Two days ago in the police file, the deceased Preeti suddenly appeared in the market to the locals
 jiske baad logon ne uskaa peechha kiya or use pakad kar police ke hawaale kar diya
 With the arrest of Preeti, the half-and-half police investigation started to open, and with this, questions were raised on the entire investigation
 ranchi ke diaiji kaa kahana he ki doshi pulicekarmiyon ko baksaa nahin jaayegaa
 Significantly, in the investigation of Preity's murder case, Bundu DSP, Bundu Thanedar and Inspector of Dhurwa police station of Ranchi have played an important role
 vaise police ke saamne ladki ne bataaya kii usne teenon ladakon kii giraftaar ke 15 din baad hi apane pita ko phone kar bataa diya tha ki wo jinda he, phir bhi uske pita ne yah baat police se kyon chhipaai

 usne phir kaha ki aap phir maaro
 So i slapped him 17 for that scene and i really had to slap him because you can't get a good reaction from actors by slapping them in the air '@ anilkapoorhas always been a perfectionist when it comes to his shots

 Then in Delhi, so many layers of onion-politics have been exposed and so much smell has been spread that even the red onion can be embarrassed

 The Minister of Delhi Government had done the day before
 In the exclusive interview with Aaj Tak, the Food and Supplies Minister of Delhi Government Aseem Khan said that Delhi Government is ready to take interest from NAFED, whether it gives 19 rupees, 20 rupees kilo
 Give or give 25 rupees a kg
 kyonki sarkaar kaa makasad he dilli ko sasti pyaaj muhaiyaa karana lekin shuukravaar subah dilli sarkaar ne nafed ko ek chitthee bheji jisamen likhaa ki dilli sarkaar nafed se pyaaj kharidne kii ichha rakhti he lekin uski do sharten hai
 The first condition of the Delhi government is that the first condition is that the price of onion should not be more than 19 rupees and this 19 rupees includes storage loss which is called storage loss and also includes the cost of transportation i
e
 transportation and the second is that the delivery of onion also to the government Needed at Anand Vihar in Delhi, not that she will take onion from Nashik

 na to wo ye maanane ko taiyaar hai ki nafed main april se lekar june tak dilli sarkaar ko chitthiyaan likhin or na ye maanane ko taiyaar hai nafed dilli sarkaar ko sasti pyaaj dene ko taiyaar thi
 The interesting thing is that the Delhi government or Aam Aadmi Party leaders have only allegations in defense, no evidence
 nafed ke diarector ashok thakur kii maane to puramamla sasti pyaaj kharidne yaa bechney kaahe hi nahin
 The case is to raise the stock of 2500 metric tons of onions that the central government has reserved in the name of Delhi

 His interviews are very much discussed these days

 After watching Sara's work in Kedarnath last year, her grandmother Sharmila Tagore said, "I am proud of Sara, i could not recognize myself after seeing her work and confidence
" bharat main ramajaan shuru ho chukaa he
 During this time, Muslims keep fast for a month
 roje ke dauraan rojedaar naa hi kuch khate hai or naa hi kuch pite hai
 In Ramadan, Muslims do morning dawn before the sun rises and open their fast with iftar when the sun sets
 duniya ke alag-alag deshon main sahari or iftaar ke vakt har saal alag-alag to hote hi hai saath hi saath roje ke ghante bhi alag-alag hote hai
 This makes the challenge of keeping fast for the people of every country different
 lekin in sab main sabase ahm chunauti norway kii he kyonki praaia: yahaan suraj doobane ke intjaar main taarikh badal jaati he or suraj apni jagah se tus se mas nahin hota
 Currently, the sun remains in the sky for about 20 hours a day this year
 norv main do lakh ke aasapaas musalmaan hai
 Beginning the Pak month of Ramadan, loudspeakers hanging on mosques in Norway announce around five o'clock in the morning that the time for fasting has begun
 phir intjaar suraj dhalane par us ajaan kaa jo yah batayega ki ab rojaa iftaar karne kaa samay ho chukaa he
 This wait is long here because the sun shines here for 20 hours a day
 ab yahaan rah rahe musalamaanon ke bich badi duvidha he ki vah suraj ugane se lekar suraj dhalane tak rojaa rakhane ke apane is parv ko yahaan kaise manaaen? kya unhen din ke 20 ghante tak bina khaae pie rahanaa hoga yaa unki is duvidha ke liye koi bich kaa rasta nikaala ja saktaa he? ab islamic hadith ke mutabik, ramajaan ke paak maheene main sachche musalmaan ko din ke vakt upwas rakhane or raat ke vakt ibaadat karne ko allaah ne campalsari kar rakhaa he
 Therefore, in Norway and some nearby countries, Muslims have to fast for more than 20 hours and the remaining 2-3 hours in preparation for the next day's fast
 darasal ramajaan kii taarikh lunar calendar se nirdhaarit hoti he isliye har saal yah parv 11 din aage bad jaataa he
 Therefore, during the last two years, the month of Ramadan has reached that time of summer when the sun sets here for only 2-3 hours of the day
 isse pehle garmi main ramajaan 1980 ke dashak main padaa tha lekin us vakt yahaan musalmaan jansankhya na ke baraabar thi
 Now most of the Muslim leaders are also unanimous that according to the hadith, the Muslims living in such areas will have to continue the fast till the sun sets
 vahiin kuch musalamaanon ne koshish kii ki ve soudi arab se fatwa kara len ki unhen makka ke samay ke mutabik rojaa rakhane kii ijaajat mil jaae
 But this could not happen and the challenge before them is how to celebrate this festival for a whole month without eating for more than 20 hours a day

 ) centre kii narendra modi sarkaar ne shuukravaar ko apane kaarykaal kaa aakhri or antarim bajet pesh kiya
 Since general elections are to be held in the country in a few months, the government which is completing its term, presents an interim vote as per tradition
 loksabhaa chunaav ke muhane par khadi centre sarkaar ne is bajet main kai loklubhaavan vaade kiye hai
 In this, many big announcements have been made regarding cash transfer in the account of farmers, forgiveness of tax to the income of up to 5 lakhs as well as pension to the workers of unorganized sector
 purv vittamantri pi
 Chidambaram has described this budget as the accounting of votes
 desh main jari pratha ke anusaar kaarykaal puraa kar rahi sarkaar antarim bajet pesh karti he, or kai baar antarim bajet kii jagah lekhanudaan yani vot on acount bhi pesh kiya jaataa he
 Since the present government has only a short period of tenure, the government has to take permission from the Parliament to bear the expenses till the newly formed government presents the full budget
 lihaaja is tarah ke bajet main aam taur par sarkaar kii taraf se koi badi ghoshnaaen or nitigat faisle nahin liye jate
 Therefore, it only contains the details of income and expenditure for a few months
 kyonki maujuuda sarkaar apane vittiya faisle aane vaali sarkaar par nahin thope sakati
 Although no word for the name Interim Budget exists in the Constitution, it is simply part of a healthy democratic tradition
 lekin is baar ke bajet main centre kii modi sarkaar ne 5 lakh tak kii aay par tex se chhot, laghu evam seemaant kisaanon ke khate main sidhe cash transfar kii ghoshnaa karte hue bataaya isse sarkaar ke khajaane par 75,000 karod kaa atirikt bhaar padegaa
 However, the government has allocated funds for this only for the current financial year
 vahiin centre sarkaar ne asangathit kshetra main mazdooron ke liye nai pension skim kii bhi ghoshnaa kii he
 Under which it has been announced to pay a pension of Rs 3000 per month after the age of 60 on payment of premium of Rs 100 per month
 yah sab aisi yojanaayen hai, jinka boj aane vaali sarkaar ko uthaanaa padegaa
 The new government that will be formed after the Lok Sabha elections, as a rule, has the right to present the full budget
 lekin modi sarkaar ne apane antarim bajet main itani badi ghoshnaaen karke jo daanv khelaa he use aane vaali sarkaar dwaara palatney ke liye isse bhi badi lakeer khinchni hogi
 For example, the decision to keep income of up to 5 lakh out of the tax net is a big relief for the middle class
 is faisle ko palatney ke liye aane vaali sarkaar ko isse bhi badi ghoshnaa kerani hogi
 Similarly, the issue of farmers has become so sensitive in recent times that it would be like burning hands in the fire to take small decisions in their interest
 sarkaar ko apane antim or antarim bajet main tex main badlaav karne kii koi sanvaidhanik pabandi nahin he
 But respecting the democratic tradition till now, this sentiment has been taken care not to announce major policy changes and new schemes
 kabhi-kabhi sarkaar antarim bajet kii jagah lekhanudaan pesh karti he, jisamen sarkari kharch chalaane ke liye samekit nidhi se dhan nikaalane ke liye sarkaar ko sansad kii manjuuri leni hoti he
 The first interim budget of Azad India was presented by Morarji Desai in 1962-63
 iske baad se lekar ab tak 12 antarim bajet pesh kiye ja chuke hai

 ISRO Chairman Dr
 kailashwadivu sivan ne group edetorial diarector raaj chengappa se khaas baatcheet main des ke pehle maanav antariksh mishan ke bare main vistaar se bataaya
 Excerpts: america, rus or china ke baad hindustan chauthaa desh hoga jo antariksh main maanav mishan bhejega
 What is so special about sending humans to space? Why are we doing this — isn't it like inventing the wheel again? Actually, it's not just about sending humans to space
 science or technology ke bare main puure desh kii samaj kaa str badhegaa
 It will inspire the youth to do something new and encourage them to participate in science programs
 is khaas project ke saath kai sansthaaen or udyog jude hai
 In this sense, it is not just isro's project but a national project
 isamen shaamil harek bhartiya agency apane hunar ko pradarshit kar sakati he or desh us par garv kar saktaa he
 In science and technology, we are equal to developed countries
 badi chunautiyaan koun koun-si hai jinase isro ko paar paanaa he?hamaare paas jo bhi technology he, vah upgrah launch karne se judi he
 But when we launch Insan, in addition to engineering and technical aspects, it also includes human things, life sciences
 hamen pakkaa karnaa padataa he ki modul ke bheetar insaan surakshit rahe or tamaam halaat vaise hi hon jaise prithvi par hote hai
 Creating such an environment and creating such an environment is a challenge for us, it is new for us
 hamane inamen se kuch kaam ko pehle aajamaaya he, masalan anvyranment control or life saport system
 We have done a lot of study on space suites
 magar ab hamen ise or aage le jane kii jarurat he
 What kind of training will be required for an astronaut and who will be eligible for it? It is not necessary that he is a fighter pilot
 koi bhi ja saktaa he, basharte ve manovaigyanik, shaareerik or maansik taur par feet hon
 Of course the strength and endurance of the fighter pilot will be better than others
 magar ham is par kaam kar rahe hai ki unhen kaise chune or kaise prashikshan den
 The Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Bangalore has facilities for training astronauts
 unhone rakesh sharma ke liye yahi kaam kiya tha
 But we will need much more rigorous training and may have to develop capabilities for that
 pradhanmantri ne jo lakshya tay kar diya he, 2022, usko dekhte hue hamen antarrashtriya sahyog kii or bahari suvidhaon or pranaaliyon ke istemaal kii jarurat pad sakati he
 What about the rocket launcher to deliver the capsule to Orbit? We already have that capability
 hamaara jieselvi mark 3 heavi lift launture prithvi kii kaksha main 10 ton bhaar uthaakar le jane main sakasham he, jabaki hamaara spes orbitor mahaj takreeban saat ton vajan kaa hoga
 Our main criterion is maximum payload when launching a regular satellite
 magar inasaani mishan ke liye sabase ahm baat he adhiktam suraksha
 Therefore, the launch vehicle system will have to have a human-rated version (to meet the assessment of carrying man) and we have to ensure that it does not fail under any circumstances and is completely safe
 launch ke dauraan naakaami kii sthiti main kru ke liye bachaav pranali kii bhi jarurat hogi?cruescape system hamane bana liya he or uskaa pareekshan bhi kar liya he
 Not only during launch, if there is any disaster or danger to the Astronaut at any time during the flight, the module will exit the launch vehicle and get out of danger
 isamen teji se pratikriya karne vaali solid motor or prakshepan vaahan ko sthir karne vaali pranali shaamil he
 We have also tested the module for re-entry and reinstatement after splashdown at sea
 isamen vaapasi par vayumandal main dobaaraa daakhil hote vakt ise oonche taapmaana or dabaavon se bachaana bhi shaamil he
 Do you plan to test the orbiter with the first unmanned mission? We want to do two tests from start to finish before launching the orbiter with Astronaut
 ham vayumandal or life saport system ke pareekshan ke liye or saath hi taapmaana or dabaav main bahut zyada badlaavon se bachaav ke liye bhi kuch reharsal udaanen chodenge
 These flights will also test protection against cosmic rays and microscopic meteorites of the galaxy that can affect the orbiter
 ham orbitor kaa splashdown bhi karenge
 We have to make sure that everything is complete
 is project kii kul laagat kitni he? kya is par duusare deshon main kiye gaye kharch ke mukaable main kam laagat aegi?ham soch rahe hai ki yah 10,000 karod ru
 Will be
 yah koi bahut zyada nahin he
 This is because we have developed all the most important and important technologies
 yah vaahan bhi pehle se maujuud he
 The only work left for us is to build a training facility and infrastructure for the launch

 The massive action has been initiated a day after the PNB exposed the involvement of Nirav Modi's companies and some other accounts of the bank's Mumbai-based Brady House branch in the Rs 11,360 crore scandal
 PNB ke kam se kam 10 bank karmiyon ko nilambit kiya gaya he, lekin PNB kii karj anumati cameti yaa nideshak mandal se koi inamen shaamil he yaa nahin, yah abhi saaf nahin hua he

 rahul gandhi beeti 19 janvari ko congress ke upaadhyaksh bane tab party kaaryakartaaon ko laga ki november maheene ke ant main hone vaale madhya pradesh vidhansabha chunaav tak sab kuch patari par aa jayega
 Now that there is only eight months left in the election, factionalism in the party is becoming more intense
 rahul ke matbhedon ko sulajhane or party ko majboot banane ke prayaason ke baavjood party mahasachiv digvijay singh ke kareebi pradesh congress adhyaksh kantilal bhuriya or kendriya mantri jyotiraditya sindhiya ke bich bayaanbaji ab saarvajanik manchon par najar aane lagi he
 With Rahul becoming the vice president, Digvijay Singh is trying to take over the reins of party affairs and factionalism is increasing throughout the process
 naubat yah aa gai ki bhuriya ne 11 march ko bhopal main sanvadaataaon se sindhiya ke madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri pad kii daud main shaamil hone ke sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue kaha, ''sindhiya party se or kya chaahate hai? unako kendriya mantri banaaya gaya he
 "bhuria made this remark just two days after Scindia's statement in which Scindia asked party workers during their visit to Nimar," Will you support me if i get an opportunity? He also said at that time that Bhuria should take everyone with him
 mantri banane ke baad sindhiya ne rajya ke 17 se adhik jilon kaa daura kiya or is dauraan unhone acchhee bheed jutai
 Seeing this, his rival camp within the party was not happy at all
 bhuriya kii tippanee ke thik ek din baad rahul ne unhen or vidhansabha main vipaksh ke netaa ajay singh ko nai dilli baatcheet ke liye bula liya
 According to Ajay Singh, the Congress vice-president asked him to strengthen the party and take the streets of the state to tell the people the truth of BJP rule
 baatcheet kaa silsilaa aage badhaane ke liye unhen 45 din baad phir se bulaayaa gaya he
 However, when Ajay Singh was asked about the ongoing Jubani war between Scindia and Bhuria, he called it 'unfortunate'
 donon diggajon ke bich jari is tanaav kii khabar rahul ko pehali baar 6 march ko lagi thi jab saansadon se baatcheet karne ke liye bulaai gai baithak main bhuriya ne sindhiya par hamalaa bolte hue kaha tha ki ve rajya ikai ko ekajute nahin kar rahe hai, ve sanghathan ke kaaryakramon main shirkat bhi nahin karte lekin rajya kaa jamkar daura kar rahe hai
 Scindia then protested that he was taking part in the party's activities related to his ministry
 yahaan jab sthiti aape se baahar hone lagi to rahul ko hastkshep karnaa padaa tha
 Rahul presided over the meeting of the party chiefs and the legislative party on 15 February in New Delhi
 is baithak main bhi bhuriya ne rahul se shikaayat karte hue kaha tha sindhiya or kendriya mantri kamalnath rajya ikai ke saath sahyog nahin kar rahe hai
 Political experts believe that Bhuria is doing all this at the behest of Digvijay Singh, who wants to take over the affairs of the party affairs in Madhya Pradesh completely and so he used Kantilal Bhuria to shoot two targets with one stone
 Is planned
 sindhiya or bhuriya ke bich pichley saal tak sab kuch thik tha
 Scindia supported his move last year when Bhuria left the cabinet and took over the reins of the state unit
 isse apane kareebi ajay singh ko rajya main mukhyamantri kii kursi par baitaane kaa sapana dekh rahe digvijay singh baichaiyn ho uthe the
 Scindia and Bhuria addressed a meeting together last year
 lekin donon ke bich yah khushnuma rishta zyada din tak nahin chalaa
 Difficulties in the Congress started when Digvijay Singh said on September 2, 2012 that he would support Scindia for the post of Chief Minister
 unhone sanvadaataaon se kaha tha, ''agar party adhyaksh sonia gandhi vidhansabha chunaav ke liye sindhiya ko maidan main utaarti hai to ham unako puraa samarthan denge
 After this statement, there was an uproar over the making of Scindia as the Chief Ministerial candidate
 digvijay singh ne chaalaaki se yah bayaan diya tha, unke is nape-tule bayaan se utsahit sindhiya ne bhavukta main apane samarthakon kaa bhi utsaah badha diya
 Especially the young leaders of the party, in a meeting held in September last year, demanded to make Scindia the state president
 yahaan tak ki kabhi digvijay singh ke sahyogi rahe varisht congressi netaa mahesh joshi ne kuch or netaaon ke saath milakar congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi se mulaakaat kii or bhuriya kii jagah sindhiya ko niyukt karne kii maang kii
 But Sonia rejected his demand
 darasal, ve samaj chuki thim ki sindhiya camp bhuriya kii chhavi kharaab karne ke liye abhiyaan chalaa rahaa he
 If party sources are to be believed, this is the reason why the Congress high command has stepped back from its plan to give Scindia some big responsibility in the upcoming elections

 com / m3bkk2mhmf — Congress (@incindia) January 14, 2018 Let us know that the Twitter handle of Youth Congress magazine 'yuva Sandesh' during the Gujarat elections was tweeted in a tone of derision linking Modi to selling tea
 is par rahul gandhi kii ore se sakht rukh dikhaae jane ke baad youth congress ne maafee maangate hue post ko hataa liya tha
 When Manishankar gave a similar 'lowly' statement, Rahul directly suspended him from the party
 congress ke twitor handle par aplod hue video par party khamosh to ho gai he lekin twit naa to waapas liya gaya he or naa hi khed jataayaa gaya he
 In such a situation, it seems that the Congress may be looking at the policy of 'oil look and oil edge'
 yani chuppi saadhane bhar se hi kaam chal jaye to thik varanaa jab zyadahalla hoga, tab dekha jayega
 On Monday, Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi has only said on this video that it should be seen as a human, not politicized
 party kii soshal media team ne ye video daalaa he, jisaki pramukh divya spandana hai
 In such a situation, the party's media department distanced itself from this, headed by Randeep Surjewala
 media vibhaag kii chuppi kii vajah bhi shaayad yahi he ki, agar video ulta pade to gaaj soshal media vibhaag par hi gire
 In such a situation, everyone's eyes are on whether Rahul Gandhi is forced to take action on this or else the work of the party will be done by keeping silence

 The comments is bich, rajyasabha main party ke netaa arun jetali ne kaha ki sarkaar kii uplabdhi bas itani he ki usne chaar saal puure kar liye
 However, this achievement was also achieved because the government abused the CBI heavily
 agar sarkaar aisa (sibiai kaa durupyog) nahin karti to samaajawaadee party (sapa) or bahujan samaaj party (basapa) use hameshaa nahin bachaate rahete
 On this occasion, both senior BJP leaders also targeted the Prime Minister
 sushamaa ne kaha ki manmohan singh na netaa ban paae, na pradhanmantri, jabaki arun jetali ne kaha ki pradhanmantri kaa ohada majaak kaa paatr banakar rah gaya he
 In fact, BJP has been alleging that despite Manmohan Singh being the Prime Minister, all kinds of decisions are taken by UPA President Sonia Gandhi

 The controversy that began after the removal of Cyrus Mistry as chairman of Tata Sons is not being named
 sirus mistre ratan tata or tata sans par hamalaa karne kaa koi mauka nahin chhod rahe hai
 Mistry has now said that it is wrong and mischievous to say that the action he took in the tata-docomo cases was on his own and that Ratan Tata was not aware of it
 sires mistre ne aisi charchaaon ko niraadhaar bataaya ki docomo mudde ko jis dhang se liya gaya vahatata samoohaki samskruti or mulyon se mail nahin khaataa tha
 All decisions regarding the Docomo deal were taken with the approval of the Board of Directors of Tata Sons and all steps are consistent with the decisions taken collectively
 mistre ne is tarah kii baton ko bhi khaarij kiya he ki docomo ke khilaaf jis dhang se mukadmaa ladaa useratan tatashayad manjuur nahin karte
 The statement said that Mistry always said that the Tata-group should respect all its commitments as per law
 docomo ke saath tata kaa mukademagauratlab he ki japan kii antiti docomo company kaa tata samooh ke saath sheyaron ke bhugtan ko lekar mukadmaa chal rahaa he
 Docomo made 26 in Tata Teleservices in November 2009
 5 pratishat hissedari lee thi
 At that time the deal was worth Rs 12,740 crore at a price of Rs 117 per share
 us samay yah sahmati hui thi ki paanch saal ke andar company chhodane par use adhigrahan kii keemat kaa kam se kam 50 pratishat bhugtan waapas kiya jayega
 Docomo decided to divest from the company in April 2014 and demanded Rs 7,200 crore at Rs 58 per share
 lekin tata samooh ne use rigerv bank ke ek niyam kaa hawala dete hue 23
 34 Paid per share offered
 badhata chalaa gaya vivadarabiai ke niyam ke anusaar koi videshi company yadi nivesh se baahar nikalati he to use share puunji par laabh ke aadhaar par tay keemat se adhik kaa bhugtan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Japanese company went through the international punch decision process and 1 in its favor
 17 arab dollar kii deal hui he
 Tata Sons has said that it will oppose the compliance of the Panchirnayya as it is bound by the local laws of India
 mistre kii ore se jari bayaan main kaha gaya he ki unke netritv main tata samooh ne docomo se anurodh kiya ki vah is maamme main uske saath mil kar rigerv bank se anumati maange par docomo is par taiyaar nahin hui
 The Tata group, however, applied for approval from the Reserve Bank but the approval was not granted and Docomo went to the International Panchrishnay Manch

 naagarikta sanshodhan bill par jahaan jediu aapas main banty aa rahi he to maharashtra main shivasena ke saath milakar sarkaar banane vaali congress bhi is mudde par aamane saamne aa gai he
 Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has attacked the 'citizenship Amendment Bill Constitution on this issue
 jo koi bhi iskaa samarthan karata he wo hamaare desh kii buniyaad par hamalaa or ise nasht karne kaa prayaas kar rahaa he
 'let me tell you that this Shiv Sena has voted in favor of the government in Lok Sabha on this citizenship amendment bill
 vahiin shivasena is mudde par khulkar sarkaar kaa samarthan kar rahi he
 Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant was asked if the party would support the bill in Rajya Sabha, he said, would we have a different role? There is no monopoly on the Shiv Sena standing by taking the role of national interest
 vahiin enditivi se baatcheet main arvind saavant ne saaf kiya he ki hamaare bich kaaman minimum program maharashtra ke liye he
 The # CAB is an attack on the Indian constitution
 Anyone who supports it is attacking and attempting to destroy the foundation of our nation
 On this issue, Bala Saheb Thorat, the Maharashtra Congress president and a minister in the coalition government, was seen as defensive
 unhone kaha ki shivasena ne sidhe samarthan nahin diya he unka bhi kuch suzav tha
 Whereas NCP leader Nawab Malik said that 'there will be some contradictions like there are many issues between BJP and JDU in Bihar'
 aapako bataa den ki maharashtra main congress-ncp or shivasena gathbandhan kii sarkaar banane ke baad yah pehla mauka he jab kisi mudde par matbhed saamne aae hai

 Delhi Pradesh Congress President Arvinder Singh will not contest the Lovely Assembly elections
 congress party ne aaj iskaa aupchaarik elaan kar diya
 Significantly, the Congress had announced Lovely's candidature in its first list
 ab party kaa kahana he ki lavali ek vidhansabha kshetra se bandhane kii bajaay puri dilli main sanghathan ko majbooti dene kaa kaam karenge
 Therefore, PC Chacko, in charge of Delhi, says that the party requested him not to contest elections, which he has accepted
 unki jagah kal yani somvaar ko nae naam kaa elaan kiya jayega
 But the reason behind the withdrawal from Lovely Ground is not being told so directly
 kaha ja rahaa he ki lavali ajay maakan ko prachaar samiti kii kaman saunpe jane kii baat se naaraaz the
 Although the formal announcement to hand over the command of the campaign committee to Maken was made on 13 January, preparations for it had already started in the party
 lavali ko ye baat nagavar guzari kyonki unhen party kii kaman tab saunpi gai jab party ko dilli ke pichley chunaav main karaari haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Since then Lovely has been working hard throughout the day to build the party
 maakan rahul gandhi ke qareebi maane jate hai or maakan ko 101 sadasyi prachaar samiti kaa pramukh banane main rahul kii bhoomika ahm rahi he
 Lovely was shocked to see Maken ahead at the last moment
 haalanki khud lavali aisi kisi naaraazgi se saaf inkaar kar rahe hai
 They say that the party is bigger than Lovely and they are always ready to take the responsibility given by the party
 unka kahana he ki maakan ke naam kaa prastaav unhone hi rakhaa tha isliye vivaad kaa koi sawaal hi nahin
 Meanwhile, Ajay Maken has also denied any differences with Lovely or any factionalism in the party
 unka kahana he ki lavali or haaron yousuf ke saath unki tikdi dilli main 15 saal se bhi zyaada se saath mil kar kaam karti aayi he or isamen foot kaa koi sawaal hi nahin
 One information also says that Lovely, winning four consecutive times from Gandhinagar, was afraid of losing this time, so he withdrew his name
 haalanki lavali ise betuka bataate hai or kehete hai ki gandhinagar kii janata par unhen puraa bharosa he or jis tarah se vah unhen jitati rahi he unki taraf se khadaa kiye gaye kisi bhi ummidavaar ko jitaayegi
 It is believed that Surendra Sharma, the block president of Gandhinagar, can be made the Congress candidate

 Mama mama has a difference
 unhone kaha, 'main madhya pradesh kii janata se apil karata hum ki wo congress ke 55 saal ke kushasan ko dobaaraa nahin aane de
 PM Modi said that because of the sins of the Congress, farmers are burdened with debt
 unhone kaha ki madhya pradesh main ek taraf congress kaa 55 saal kaa kushasan he, to duusari ore 15 saal kaa bhaajapa kaa sushasan he
 PM Modi asked, what is the reason that people are rejecting the Congress party? The Congress party has ruled from Panchayat to Parliament and in every state
 is dauraan piem modi ne naaraa diya- na darbari, na raja or na hi maharaj is baar phir se shivaraj
 PM Modi asked the public that should the Congress not put its Chief Minister's face in front of you? When the Congress Party does not believe in you, should you trust the Congress Party? Should you vote in favor of the Congress on November 28? PM Modi said that it has been 40 years in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, but the people there have not allowed the Congress to come to power
 unhone kaha ki congress ke parivaarwaad or vanshavaad se log tang aa gaye the
 He appealed to the public not to let the Congress come to power in Madhya Pradesh
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress party desh ke liye boj ban gai he
 Its political character has reached a lower level

 piem modi ne kaha ki main hairaan hum ki do din pehle congress ke ek netaa ne meri maa ko chunaav main khinch laayaa
 My mother who does not even know Madhya Pradesh, is it right for her to be drawn into it
 or ab ve mere pita ko chunaav main ghaseet laae hai
 PM Modi said that my father who has passed away 30 years ago, what is the reason that he is dragging my parents in it
 piem modi ne kaha ki main kisi ke parivaar ke bare main bayaan nahin detaa lekin main purv pradhanmantri ke khilaaf bol rahaa hum
 If my parents were in politics, Congressmen had the right to speak on them
 piem modi yahi nahin ruke
 He also targeted Congress President Rahul Gandhi
 piem modi ne kaha ki congress main koi aisa he jo namdaar ke khilaaf bol sake
 They are just lying without giving any proof
 hamane vikaas kiya he or yahi hamaara mudda he
 This rally of PM Modi took place in Mirzapur New Mandi
 yahaan se ve vidisha sahit aasapaas ke jilon kii 15 vidhansabha siton tak pahunchane kiye

 What did the Congress leader, Congress leader and former Union Minister Vilasrao Muttewar said about PM Modi, that the Prime Minister whose father's name is not known to anyone, Modi asks for accounts from Rahul Gandhi, while there is a Rahul Gandhi whose Everyone knows about generations
 purv kendriya mantri ne kaha ki piem narendra modi jo rahul gandhi se bhid rahe hai, narendra modi ko piem banane se pehle koun jaanata tha
 Even today no one knows the name of the father of PM Narendra Modi, but does everyone know the name of the father of Rahul Gandhi, even for generations, and whose father's name is not known, they are asking for accounts from Prime Minister Modi, Rahul Gandhi
 kis baat kaa hisaab maang rahe hai
 Prior to 'dangerous game playing Congress at Ram temple', PM Modi addressed a rally in Alwar, Rajasthan
 piem modi ne congress par jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa
 He accused the Congress of postponing the Ram temple to the Supreme Court and spreading casteism
 piem narendra modi ne ayodhya maamle ko lekar kaha ki congress khatarnaak khel kar rahi he
 The Supreme Court wants to decide on Ayodhya after listening to the people, but the Congress is intimidating the judges of the Supreme Court by bringing impeachment
 piem modi ab iske baad jabalpur main bhi ek raily ko sambodhit karenge
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a meeting at the Garrison Ground in Jabalpur
 yahaan se piem modi jabalpur kii sabhi 8 vidhansabhaon ko saadhane kii koshish karenge

 Regardless of the indecent rhetoric against BSP supremo Mayawati, the BJP high command has shown her leader Dayashankar Singh a way out of the party, but the way wife Swati Singh came forward and took the front against Mayawati, she kept within the BJP Has created pressure in support of Dayashankar
 party netaaon main ab ye bhi sugabugahat daud gai he ki dayashankar singh ke khilaaf bijepi ne jaldbaaji main kuch zyada hi sakht karrwai kar di
 In such a situation, there is also a demand to take Dayashankar back into the party
 baliya ke bijepi saansad bharat singh ne 'ajtak' se khaas baatcheet main saaf kiya he kibispi supremeo mayawatike khilaaf abhadra bhashaa kaa istemaal kar bhale hidayashankarne galat kiya, lekin isse unke samarthakon ko unke parivaar ke khilaaf abhadra bayaan dene kaa haq to nahin mil jaataa
 According to Bharat Singh, if Mayawati does not drop Nasimuddin Siddiqui from the party, he demands from the BJP high command that Dayashankar Singh be immediately withdrawn to BJP
 dayashankar kii patni-beti se maafee maangen mayawatibharat singh se jab ye sawaal poocha gaya ki ek baar bijepi ne dayashankar singh ko party se baahar kaa rasta dikhaa diya he, to unki vaapasi kii maang se kya galat sandesh nahin jayega? isapar unka kahana he ki party ne alaakaman ke nirdesh par hi ‘beti ke sammaan main-bijepi he maidan main’ kaa andolan shuru kiya he
 This movement will not stop until Kimayawati takes strict action for misrepresentation of her leaders
 saath hi unhen dayashankar kii patni-naaballig beti se maafee bhi maangani padegi
 If she does not do so, the BJP will do nothing to raise voice against the BSP supremo from the road to the house
 siddiki ke khilaaf lagaaya jaae poxobharat singh ke mutabik, mayawati kidaulat kii betikehane vaale netaa bispi se hi nikalakar aae hai
 Senior BSP leaders Jugal Kishore and Swami Prasad Maurya were the first to accuse him of this
 maamle main mayawati kii safai ko bhi bharat singh ne khaarij kar diya he
 "what does it mean to announce someone's wife and minor daughter?" is gairjimmedaarana bayaan par to nasimuddin siddiki ke khilaafpoxo (pocso)ke tahat mukadmaa darj hona chahie
 He said that Nasimuddin has given provocative statements for the rape

 The Congress attacked the central government, saying that for the last 56 months, the opposition has been continuously providing evidence of how the central government is misusing the investigating agencies against the opposition
 congress pravaktaa manish tiwari ne kaha ki is baat kii pushti khud bina mantralay ke mantri arun jetali ne kii he
 It is not normal that a Union Minister should write a blog and publicly question the investigating agency
 ab jab sootboot vaale agenciyon ke chapet main aae hai to unke bachaav main sarkaar main unke log 'investegative advencharism' kii baat kah rahe hai
 These agencies are given a free hand by the government when they file false cases against opposition leaders

 Manish Tiwari said that our question is what is the point of closing the investigation due to mental stress of the accused? Did the investigation stop because Goyal is related to CBDT chief Sushil Chandra? Prime Minister, Finance Minister, answer to whether this step is compatible with the government's claim to end black money? What does the government want to convey through this? This entire matter should be closely investigated so that the truth can come before the country

 Petrol prices have crossed ₹ 80 per liter in many states, while the government is clarifying that the states are also earning more tax from this increase
 ajtak se baatcheet main sipiem mahasachiv seetaram yechuri ne kaha, hamaare padosi deshon ke mukaable hamaare desh main tel kii keemten lagbhag ₹10 prati litre zyada hai
 The government is increasing its income and benefiting a few private companies
 yah hamalaa puri awam ke upar ho rahaa he
 Yechury announced that there will soon be a large public outrage and mass movement regarding the increased oil prices
 modi sarkaar par jhooth bolne kaa aarope lagaate hue yechuri ne kaha ki yah sarkaar jhooth par tiki he
 Reversing the argument of the state government's earnings to the states, Yechury said, "the central government levies taxes of 36 to ₹ 40 on petrol prices
" yah saraasar jhooth he ki rajya sarkaron kii vajah se yah daam bad rahe hai
 Yechury raised the question that if the leftist government of Kerala can reduce the prices of oil by ₹ 1 per liter, then why are petrol and diesel prices not coming down in 21 BJP ruled states? The opposition leader presented false figures on the central government and looted the rising oil prices with the people of the country

 The no-confidence motion presented against the central government in the Monsoon Session of Parliament fell by a huge margin (325 against 126) on 20 July

 The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies appeared happy with this victory, but it has also highlighted their challenges
 vahiin pichley chaar saal se post vipaksh pehali baar sarkaar se muqabla karne kii sthiti main najar aa rahaa he
 Due to this knock of challenges, BJP has started examining and changing its strategy of 2019 afresh

 The Shiv Sena is an ally in the BJP government at the Center and Maharashtra
 darasal, shivasena ne avishvaas prastaav ke dauraan sansad main anupasthit rahakar bhaajapa kaa saath nahin diya
 Despite this, BJP national president Amit Shah had spoken to party chief Uddhav Thackeray a day earlier and was expected to vote in favor of the BJP
 haalanki isse modi sarkaar ko fark nahin padaa lekin shivasena ne endie ko ekajute rakhane kii bhaajapa kii koshishon ko jhatka de diya
 If he had voted in favor of BJP, he could have got 325 more votes

 At the same time, before the monsoon session, the BJP was claiming that all the existing NDA allies would contest the 2019 elections
 lekin ab party yah khatra bhaanp chuki he ki shivasena bharosemand saathi nahin rahi
 Says a senior BJP leader, "even if you leave the absence of Shiv Sena in the discussion on the motion of no confidence, Uddhav Thackeray is quite serious to say that his Hindutva thinking is different from the bjp's definition of Hindutva
 darasal, thakare yah bayaan dekar ekajute hindu vot ko toduya chaahate hai
 Indirectly they are supporting Congress and Rahul Gandhi

 darasal unhone kaha, "endie ke ghatak apana haq kyon chhod den? unhen puure sammaan or sthaan milanaa chahie
 Uddhav Thackeray's statement on Hindutva versus Hindutva Hindutva highlighted the bjp's second challenge

 You explained to me the meaning of Shiva and you explained to me the meaning of being a Hindu
 ''rahul gandhi ne apane is bayaan ke jariye bhaajapa ke "ugr'' banaam congress ke "udaar'' hindutv ko charchaa main laa diya
 The BJP is concerned that the "united Hindu vote" may not be split with this debate

 The Modi government has repeatedly suffered from Dalit, Patidar, Maratha and peasant movements
 bhrashtachar kaa nayaa bhootpahali baar modi sarkaar ko bhrashtachar ke bade aarope se bhi do-chaar hona pad rahaa he
 During the no-confidence motion, Rahul Gandhi directly accused the Prime Minister of corruption and corporate interest in the purchase of Rafale aircraft
 soshal media main ye donon mudde khub trend main rahe
 This made the BJP uneasy and had to get Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to a media briefing on the Rafale issue
 bhaajapa ke ek netaa paroksh rup se sweekaar karte hai, "soshal media par in muddon ke charchaa main aane kii vajah se sabakaa saath, sabakaa vikaas or bhrashtachar mukt sarkaar kii chhavi ko aghat pahunch rahaa he
 a few months before the Lok Sabha elections, this discussion could be fatal on the basis of doubts on the government's impeccable image
 ''bhaajapa sutron ke mutabik, amit shah is baat ko lekar sajag hai ki sarkaar kii chhavi ko lekar koi nakaaratmak maahaul nahin bane
 He has asked party officials to present a clean image of the government with facts and figures
 bhaajapa ke ek varisht netaa kaa kahana he, "2019 ke liye hamaari ranneeti ekadam saaf he ki ham sirf vikaas or bhrashtachar mukt sarkaar kii baat ke saath janata ke bich jaaenge
 We will tell how many schemes the government is working on for farmers, youth and women, backward and scheduled castes and tribes
 ''duusari ore vipaksh baar-baar doharaa rahaa he ki bhaajapa ke vikaas main korporate ko badhaava or aam aadmi kii badahaali shaamil he
 BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya says, "no matter how much the opposition tries, the 2019 election will be on the issue of development
 '' bhaajapa ke is daawey ke baavjood vikaas kii charchaa ke liye maukey kaaphi had tak simat gaye hai
 Issues like plight of farmers and poor, unemployment and mob lynching, female harassment, militant Hindutva, unbridled cow vigilant, rationalists killing in place of government schemes are in discussion among people
 jaisaa ki loksabhaa main congress ke netaa mallikarjun khadge ne kaha, "bhaajapa netaa kehete hai ki unhone kisaanon ke liye kaaphi kuch kiya he jabaki pichley kuch varshon main kisaan aatmahatya ke maamle bad gaye hai
 He has only talked about Adani and Ambani, not farmers
 ''aage kii ranneetijaahir he, avishvaas prastaav ke baad jis tarah ke halaat bane hai or charchaa main anya mudde aa gaye hai, use dekhte hue bhaajapa ne bhi apni ranneeti main badlaav shuru kar diya he
 The party has decided to make its old policy of keeping allies flexible
 sutron ke mutabik, bhaajapa kii nai ranneeti main punjab ko chhodkar anya rajyon main apane dam par aglaa chunaav ladgaye kii taiyaari karnaa shaamil he, yahaan tak ki un rajyon main bhi jahaan sahyogiyon ke saath uski sarkaar he
 If for some reason there is a rift in the alliance during the election, the BJP will decide to contest the election alone
 vahiin hindu vot main bikharaav ko rokane ke liye bhaajapa ke netaaon ko rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (aresas) or vishwa hindu parishad ke netaaon se niyamit rup se sampark rakhane ko kaha gaya he
 a party leader says, "we will not allow the Hindu vote to be divided in collaboration with like-minded organizations
 adhyaksh amit shah 18-19 agast ko hone vaali party kii rashtriya kaarysmiti main isko lekar vistrut ranneeti saajha karenge
 In addition, to answer the allegations of being pro-corporate, the BJP is soon making a strategy to bounce back on social media by referring to corporate houses whose business has grown manifold in the last 10 years of UPA rule
 iske saath hi vah seminar or paricharchaa main congress ke shashan main hue ghotaalon par bahes shuru karegi
 BJP mps will also be given a booklet during the current session which will contain details of corruption in various departments in the Congress government so that they can use it in their parliamentary constituency
 bhaajapa ke sansadeey sutron ke mutabik, party netritv kii sabase badi chintaa rafel vimaan kharid main lag rahe aaropon ko lekar he
 The Prime Minister also wants that every MP and office bearer of the BJP has four-five concrete facts on which they can justify the purchase of Rafale aircraft at a higher price
 iske liye bhaajapa sansadeey dal kii baithak main prajentation diya jayega
 Obviously, the BJP wants to overcome all the challenges that have arisen in the new political environment through a changed strategy

 supreme court ke nishane par wo mukhyamantri, mantri or janpratinidhi bhi rahe jinhone haal ke dinon main padmavati ko lekar gaiyr jimmedaar bayaan die
 The Supreme Court on Tuesday instructed to stop making rhetoric against the film before the censor board clearance
 isse kharaab maahaul ban rahaa he
 The Supreme Court made the remarks during the hearing of a PIL
 supreme court ne sawaal kiya ki jo film sensor board se clear nahin hui he, jimmedaar padon par baithe log us par kaise tippanee kar sakate hai?court ne or kya kaha ?supreme court ne aashcharya jataayaa, nagarikon ke bich is tarah kii charchaa ek alag vishay he, lekin jimmedaar padon par baithe log is tarah ke bayaan kaise jari kar sakate hai
 The Central Government has been instructed to ensure that such statements do not come from those in responsible positions before getting clearance from CBFC
 court ne aarope lagaaya ki aise bayanon kii vajah se film ke khilaaf maahaul ban rahaa he
 Why did the Supreme Court have to make such a comment? In fact, during the ongoing controversy over Padmavati, Union Ministers, mps, Chief Ministers of several states gave controversial statements
 kuch netaaon ne padmavati ke nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali or actress deepika padukon ke sir or naak kaatane kii dhamkee di
 Also announced a reward of crores
 mana ja rahaa he ki aise bayanon ne puure maamle main aag main ghi daalane kaa kaam kiya
 Padmavati: Jim took 70 lakhs, know Deepika, Shahid, Ranvir's feesamu had announced a reward of 10 crores for the head
 The screen has the power to burn
 inhone padmavati ke nirdeshak sanjay lila bhansaali or padmavati kaa role karne vaali deepika padukon kaa sir kaatane ke badale 10 karod rupee ke inaam kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 Amu had said, 'if this film is released, we will run a cleanliness drive in theaters

 'angry or scared at Padmavati? Did not say a single word in Sharjah, Deepikasansad made a shameful statement by BJP MP from Ujjain
 unhone kaha tha ki jinke gharon main auraton ke kai shuhar hote hai wo bhala johar ke bare main kya janenge
 Union Minister Uma Bharti had said, Alauddin Khilji was barbaric
 uski rani padmavati par buree najar thi
 He was accused of tampering with history in the film
 haalanki unhone deepika ko naak kaatane kii dhamkee dene kii aalochana kii thi
 Worth noting is statement # 1 of the three Chief Ministers
 yogi adityanathupi siem yogi ne kaha tha, film ke khilaaf ho rahe virodh-pradarshan or dhamkiyon ke liye bhansaali bhi samaan rup se jimmedaar hai
 He has got used to playing with people's feelings
 unhone kaha, is vivaad main pradarshnakariyon ke saath film nirmaataaon ke khilaaf bhi karrwai honi chahie
 No one has the right to take law into their own hands
 meraa maananaa he ki agar dhamkee dene vaale doshi hai to bhansaali bhi kam doshi nahin hai
 Apart from this, he said, one should avoid giving threats like killing and should respect each other

 Apart from the open opposition of the film by the BJP governments in Captain Amarinder singhteen states, the Congress government of Punjab is also standing against it
 punjab ke siem captain amarinder singh ne film ko lekar rajputon kii aapattiyon kaa samarthan kiya tha
 The SC had rejected the petition before the Supreme Court dismissed a petition seeking removal of the alleged objectionable scenes from the film 'padmavati'
 chif justise deepak mishra, justise e em khanvilakar or justise dhananjay vaai chandrachud kii teen sadasyeey khandpeeth ko suchit kiya gaya tha ki is film ko abhi tak kendriya film pramann board se pramaan patr nahin mila he
 To this, the bench had said, "our intervention in this petition will mean to form an opinion in advance which we are not in favor of doing
" 'vahiin duusari taraf ab ye maamla sansad kii pitishan cameti ke paas bhi pahunch gaya he
 In such a situation, the protest of the film by the state governments of North India and the anger of the Rajput community on the streets could pose a big threat to the release of Padmavati

 unhone kaha tha, agar log chaahate hai ki sensor board film par koi faisla le to unhen board ko samay, swatantraaa or maansik spes dena hoga
