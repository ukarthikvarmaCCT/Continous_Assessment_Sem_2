 The Government of Pakistan has been suffering international embarrassment due to overturning the first declaration, hours after the announcement of the release of an Indian prisoner facing the death penalty, and for the release of another Indian prisoner
 pakistan main 1990 main bam visphot kii kai ghatnaon main sanliptata ko lekar doshi tehraae gaye or maut kii sajaa kaa saamana kar sarbajit singh ko pakistan sarkaar dwaara reeha karne kii kal khabar aane ke kuch hi ghante baad raashtrapati ke pravaktaa farhatulla babar ne spasht kiya ki adhikari surajeet singh naam ke ek anya bhartiya kaidi ko reeha karne ke liye kadam uthaa rahe hai, jo jasusi ke maamle main jail main band tha
 The Express Tribune has said in its report on the front page that Pakistan has come to a state of international embarrassment over the case of mistaken identity
 ‘don’ samachar patr kii website ne is ghatnakram ko anokhe tareeke se liya gaya sarkaar kaa ‘you turn’ qaraar diya he
 The President's spokesperson termed the disturbance as 'confusion' and has tried to separate President Asif Ali Zardari from the episode
 babar ne kaha ki maamle main raashtrapati kaa koi bhi ullekh ‘sandarbh ke pare’ tha
 However, there was speculation on social media and especially on Twitter whether the government was forced to reverse any possible move to free Sarabjit due to pressure from the powerful security establishment
 pakistani sena khaastaur par bharat or america ke saath sambandhon ke maamle main videsh niti ko tay karne main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 'the Express Tribune' report said that it was not clear how the mess occurred
 kya adhikariyon kii ore se soochna dene main galati hui yaa media kii ore se reporting karne main chook hui
 Pakistani television news channels first reported yesterday afternoon that the President had commuted Sarabjit's death sentence to life imprisonment and directed the authorities to release him if Sarabjit had completed his imprisonment
 Take steps for raashtrapati ke pravaktaa ne uske baad kam se kam do bhartiya samachar channelon or pashchimi samvaad samiti ko bataaya ki sarkaar sarbajit ko reeha karne ke liye kadam uthaa rahi he
 The government apparently reversed Tuesday night around eleven and a half (local time) when the presidential spokesman confirmed that Surjit, not Sarabjit, was to be released as his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1989
 Thi and he has completed his sentence of imprisonment
 sarbajit kii rihaai kii khabar pakistan main kaaphi dekhe jane vaale tok sho main bhi chai rahi or desh ke sarvaadhik lokapriy ankar hamid mir ne sarbajit ko ‘bharat kaa ajmal kasaab’ bataaya
 Kasab is the only terrorist involved in the 2008 Mumbai attack, who was captured alive
 aaj subah tak zyaadaatar pakistani televijan samachar channelon ne sarbajit ko lekar gadabadi par reporting band kar di thi
 On some channels like Geo Channel, reports of Foreign Minister SM Krishna releasing Sarabjit and other Indian prisoners in Pakistani jails were shown
 kam se kam teen samachar patron ne bhartiya kaidiyon kii pahchaan main gadabadi ko lekar khabar nahin prakashit kii or unhone apane pehle panne par khabar prakashit kii he ki raashtrapati ke aadesh par sarbajit ko reeha kiya janaa he
 Both Sarabjit and Surjeet are currently lodged in Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore

 But before the investigation began, the Delhi Police announced that the owner of Rajasthan Royals franchise Raj Kundra had confessed to betting in IPL matches

 The court acquitted the accused for lack of evidence

 Amit Shah said in a meeting in Shamli on Thursday that this election is to avenge the humiliation
 yah ilaaka pichley saal ke dangon ke dauraan sabase zyada prabhavit rahe ilaakon main se ek he
 On Saturday, the DM of Shamli sent a tape of Amit Shah's statement to the Election Commission, which is being investigated
 (padhein-shah ke bayaan par vivaad garmaaya) Sources said that Shah's controversial statement has been sent to the Election Commission headquarters 'election House' in Delhi
 chunaav ayog kal hone vaali baithak main is mudde par koi faisla kar saktaa he
 However, the BJP attacked the SP, Congress and the BSP for registering a criminal case against Shah, saying that it was done in a planned conspiracy to give communal color to the elections in Uttar Pradesh and this action was taken in the vote bank
 Is inspired by politics

 Delhi's CM and Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal will descend on Delhi's Rajouri Garden on Thursday evening for campaigning
 vaise to dilli nagar nigam chunaav ke liye kejariwal rojaanaa jansabha karke party ke liye vot maang rahe hai lekin rajouri garden main prachaar karne ke alag myne hai
 Actually, the by-election for the assembly seat in Rajouri Garden is to be held on April 9
 yah seat 2015 ke chunaav main aam aadmi party ne jiti thi lekin vidhayak jaranel singh ne punjab main vidhansabha chunaav ladane ke liye vidhayaki se istipha de diya tha
 Now after losing elections in Punjab, this seat has become a nose question for the Aam Aadmi Party
 yah ek sikh-punjabi bahul seat bhi he
 The comments is seat kaa nateeja sanket degaa ki dilli main aam aadmi kii kya sthiti he
 Apart from this, this by-election for the Municipal Corporation of Delhi on April 23 will be no less than an opinion poll

 Let me tell you that Manjinder Singh Sirsa and Congress have made Meenakshi Chandila their candidate here by bjp-akali Dal
 darasal rajouri garden main vidhansabha seat kaa upachunaav nau april ko hona he
 The seat was won by the Aam Aadmi Party in the 2015 elections but MLA Jarnail Singh resigned from the legislature to contest the assembly elections in Punjab
 ab punjab main chunaav haarane ke baad aam aadmi party ke liye yah seat naak kaa sawaal ban gai he
 It is also a sikh-punjabi dominated seat
 tippaniyan The result of this seat will indicate what is the status of the common man in Delhi
 iske alaava 23 april ko dilli nagar nigam ke chunaav ke liye yah upachunaav kisi opinian pole se kam nahin hoga
 For this seat, the party's biggest leaders of Punjab HS Phoolka and Sanjay Singh have campaigned but Kejriwal will go for the first time
 aapako bataa den ki bijepi-akali dal ne yahaan manjinder singh sirsa or congress ne minakshi chandila ko apana ummidavaar banaaya he

 'da mujic of bollywood' naam ke is nae course ko 2010 main york uniwarsity main undergraduate chaatro ke liye shuru kiya gaya
 Students of other courses can also choose this course as elective
 uniwarsity ke lagaataar badal rahe paathyakram main is course kii maang ab bhi bani hui he
 Professor Sundar Viswanathan had a major contribution in starting this unique course
 vah dikhaanaa chaahate the ki bollywood mujic mahaj ek badi packaging nahin, iske alaava bhi isamen kaaphi kuch he
 The aim of this course is to develop a global perspective and understanding for music that has deeply influenced both foreigners and Indians over the years
 is course main lagaataar lokapriy ho rahi is style kaa vistrut vishleshan hota he
 It covers the people behind music, its beginnings and development
 isamen yah parkhaa jaataa he ki bollywood mujic duniyabar main kyon lokapriy he?bollywood dance course videshon main lambey samay se lokapriy hai
 Shows like So You Think You Can Dance and many Bollywood-themed performances increased their popularity
 york uniwarsity kaa 'da mujic of bollywood' bhartiya sangeet udyog kii sweekruti ke lihaaj se ek nae yug kii shuruyaat jaisaa he

 kavi jorge herbert ne bilkul hi thik kaha tha ek pita saikadon schooltibers se zyada jaruri hota he
 Even though we stay away from our father due to studies and employment, but still do not forget to take advice from him on the smallest thing
 jaaniye apane pita kii aisi baaten jinhen jitani jaldi ho, hamen apane jivan main jarur shaamil kar lenaa chahie
 1
 parivaar ke har sadsy kaa khyaal rakhana:papa ko sab pataa hota he chaahe parivaar bada ho yaa chota
 They are present at every point where they are needed
 agar kinhin kaarnon se maujuud na ho saken to bhi wo apni upasthiti kaa ehsaas jarur dilaate hai
 No one can tell as much as the father can teach the training of how family responsibility is handled
 kaise dusron ko khush rakhaa jaae isaki pehali paathshaal papa hi hote hai
 2
 maaf karnaa: haa, hamamen se zyaadaatar log kisi duusare kii galatiyon ko dil se lagaakar baith jate hai or shaayad hi kabhi kisi ko maaf kar paaen
 What will happen to the children if all the fathers of the world also become like this? This is a matter of consideration
 hamalogon ko apane pita se yah gun jarur sikh lenaa chahie
 3
 kathin mehnat:duniya ke zyaadaatar pita mehnatee hote hai
 Not only this, another thing is included in his fame is 'punctuality'
 apane pariwari kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye wo risk vaale kaam karne se bhi nahin chookte hai
 4
 dusron se siikhnaa:pitaaji kabhi bhi dusron se kuch seekhney main sankoch nahin karte hai
 Whether it is about gadgets or mathematics
 unhen kisi se bhi seekhney main jhijak mahasoos nahin hoti he
 This quality of learning from others always leads to success
 5
 Victory is only after defeat: Many times family faces problems, in such a time father takes very careful steps and maintains patience
 musibaton ke samay wo hameshaa yah sikhaate hai ki isse aage badhane kaa rasta siikho
 You will definitely win kya kabhi aapane dekhe hai bilakhti hui maanon ke god main khamosh lete laal, khwaabon ko mara dekh cheekhta hua baap? chatpataakar mar gayi khilakhilaati hui naunihaal naslein? duniya ke har gam par vakt apana maraham jarur lagaataa he par ye wo gam he jiskaa maharam kisi ke paas nahin
 Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was powering to eliminate terror and terrorism from Pakistan's land only last week
 phir pakistan ne aatank ke teen bade naamon ko apni god main kyon bitha rakhaa he?pakistani skool par hamalaa, bhartiya shaheedon ke sanskaraunke aansu jab girte hai to unki jameen ke daaman par sookhte hai
 When our tears fall, they dry up on our land
 kyonki aansuon kaa koi majahab nahin hota, dard kii koi jaat nahin hoti or gam kaa koi ilaaka nahin hota
 Terror not ceased from across the border after 1993 Mumbai blasts of 1993 was the first terrorist attack that put Pakistan directly in the dock
 uske baad se to pichley 23 saalon main ye silsilaa hi chal padaa
 Do not know how many cities of India were injured and shattered, but the terror coming to India through Pakistan did not stop
 darasal pakistan ko aatank kaa adda banane waalon main vahaan kii sarkaar se zyada fouj or iesai kaa haath rahaa he
 Possession of terror bosses on Pakistan is the real meaning of Pakistan
 paak farsi shabd he jabaki sthaan hindi
 Pakistan was formed by combining these two words
 lekin ab ye aatank kaa adda ban gaya he
 Shelter of terrorists
 aakhir kaise ek puraa mulk dekhte hi dekhte aatank ke changul main funs gaya? kaise ek puure mulk par aatankwaadi sanghathanon or unke aakaaon ne kabja kar liya?bharat ke seene par hai kai jakhmajavaab jaanane se pehle hindustan ke kisi bhi jakhmi shahar ko yaad kiijie, 93 ke lahuluhaalan mumbai kii karaah suniye
 Feel the greenest wound of Uri
 aatankwaadi sanghathan or unke aakaaon ke naam yaad kiijie
 Think of the country's biggest fugitive don
 bagdadi se pehle duniya ke sabase bade aatankwaadi ke khatme ke bare main gaur kiijie
 If you look in Kashmir, you will get the answer
 mumbai kaa hamalaa tha pehla warahindustan ko aatank kaa sabase bada or pehla jakhm 1993 main lahuluhaan mumbai kii shakl main mila
 It was then that the entire Mumbai-shaking face became common
 par daaud ibrahim tab tak chupake se bhaag chukaa tha
 And then went and settled in Pakistan
 karachi ke ghoshit pate par aaraam se rah rahaa he wo
 Parliament tremors Terrorism reached the threshold of Parliament on 13 December 2001 for the first time
 aatankwaadiyon ko sansad bhawan tak pahunchaaya tha jaish ke usee mukhiya maulanaa masood azhar ne jo kandahar haijacking main saudebaaji ke baad reeha ho gaya tha
 And after his release, he also went straight into the paradise of that terror
 yani pakistan main
 The US attacked Pakistan by sneaking into Pakistan and it shocked the whole world
 wo alqaida kaa mukhiya tha
 For the whole ten years, America searched the world in search of it, but eventually it was found in the same base of terror, that is, in Pakistan and killed there
 pakistan main khuleam ghoomte hai aatankiduniya ke nakshe par pakistan ke wo tamaam nakshe maujuud hai jahaan aantak kii factory chalati he
 Where there are training camps of terrorists
 hafiz said, moulana masood ajahar jaise aatankwaadiyon ko to pakistan main kabhi chupane kii bhi naubat nahin ai
 They roam freely in Pakistan
 apana boyaa hua kaat rahaa he pakistanpurani kahawat he ki insaan jo bota he, vahi katata he
 The story of the neighboring country, which was badly scorched in the fire of terror, is similar
 pakistan main alag-alag vakt par alag-alag hukmaranon or fouj ne aatankwaad ko apane-apane phaayde ke liye istemaal kiya
 Now the result is that the same terrorism is now bloodying Pakistan itself
 khud aatankwaad kaa shikaar ho rahaa pakpakiswana main aise aatanki hamale or unase hone vaali mauton kii fehrist thik kahaan se shuru hoti he or kahaan ja kar khatm hoti he, ye sahi-sahi kisi ko nahin pataa
 And the reason for this is also simple, when and where in Pakistan, there is a terrorist attack, neither the police there nor the security agencies nor the political rulers sitting on the throne and this is the reason why today The world has started calling Pakistan a paradise of terror
 haalanki ek hakeekat ye bhi he ki apni jameen par aatankwaadiyon ko panaah denevaala pakistan ab khud hi iskaa sabase zyaada shikaar ho rahaa he
 What will be the future of Pakistan, but knowing all this, the Pakistani rulers, the army and ISI agencies are not serious against terrorism for their own purpose
 balki kabhi wo khud ko aatankwaad kaa shikaar bataa kar ronaa rone lagate hai or kabhi dusron par iljaam madh dete hai
 In such a situation, tomorrow will be happy for Pakistan, at present there is no hope of this
 kya he pakistan ke sabase bade oparation kaa sach?united nesan main navaj sharif ne daawa kiya ki pakistan ne aatankwaad ke khilaaf duniya kaa sabase bada or kaamyaab oparation chalaaya
 Actually, this operation was never conducted against the two largest terrorist organizations Lashkar and Jaish sitting in the lap of Pakistan
 sharif ne yuan main khadey hokar kaha ki aatank ke khilaaf duniya kaa sabase bada or kaamyaab oparation bas pakistan ne hi kiya to lijie unki hi agency ke aankade ke jariye sach saamne aa jaataa he
 No action against the biggest terrorist organizations On June 8, 2014, 28 people were killed in a terrorist attack on Karachi's Jinnah International Airport
 isi hamale ke ek haftaa baad 15 june 2014 ko miyaan sahab ne paak sena ke 30 hajaar special javaanon kii team bana kar opareshne jarab-e-ajb kii shuruuaat kii
 Campaigns were launched specifically against the tehreek-e-taliban Pakistan, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, East Turkistan Islamic Network, lashkar-e-jhangvi, al-qaeda, Jundalla and Haqqani Network
 par kamaal dekhie lashkar-e-tayba, jaish-e-mohammad or di company ke khilaaf kabhi koi karrwai nahin kii
 While at the international level, these three have not only been declared as terrorist organizations and terrorists but also have a reward on their heads
 darasal pakistani fouj main shuru se hi ek bada dhada kattar islamic sanghathanon kaa samarthak rahaa he, jise iesai kii bhi hameshaa bharpoor madad milti rahi he
 He also has a strong hold in the unpopular politics of Pakistan
 yahi kattar dharmik sanghathan islam or jehad ke naam par aatank kii fasal taiyaar karte hai or inhone hi pakistan ko aatank kaa adda bana diya he

 i remember well that even on the day of shooting of that sequence, he said that no one is allowed to play the role of Shri Guru Govind Singh Ji
 munmun ne aage kaha, 'tarak mehta kaa ulta chashma kii ye khubsuurati he ki isamen har samskruti or dharm ke log hai
 So we always keep in mind that our dialog or act never hurts anyone's feelings

 uttarakhand ke 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad purv mukhyamantri vijay bahuguna siyaasi taur par niskriy najar aa rahe the
 But now that the Ranbheri of the Lok Sabha elections is over, he has increased his political activism by organizing a dinner party in honor of the winning candidates in the state body elections
 unki is sakriyata ne ek baar phir se rajya kii raajnneeti ko garma diya he, khaskar bhartiya janata party (bhaajapa) main
 Bahuguna's dinner diplomacy is being seen as his claim to the Tehri Lok Sabha seat
 bahuguna purv main is seat se saansad rah chuke hai
 At their dinner party held in Dehradun on January 19, Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, Cabinet Minister Prakash Pant, Subodh Uniyal, Speaker Premchandra Agarwal, MLA Ganesh Joshi, Munna Singh Chauhan, Sahadev Pundir, Harbans Kapoor, Umesh Sharma Kau, Kunwar Pranav Champion, Dehradun Many important people, including newly elected Mayor of Municipal Corporation Sunil Uniyal Gama and newly elected Mayor of Rishikesh Municipal Corporation Anita Mamgai Stay bahuguna ke netritv main hi 2016 main nau vidhayakon ne congress chhod bhaajapa kaa daaman thama tha
 Later two more mlas joined this list
 lekin, 2017 ke vidhansabha chunaav ke baad bahuguna kaa zyaadaatar samay dilli main beetaa
 Recently, when the Rajya Sabha seat in Uttarakhand fell vacant, the discussion of sending him to the upper house by the BJP got a boost
 lekin baad main narendra modi kii pasand rahe anil baluni ne unase yah mauka chin liya
 However, he still refrained from giving any indication of his claim to Tehri
 unka kahana tha ki loksabhaa chunaav ko lekar apni ranneeti kaa elaan ve march main karenge
 Actually, Bahuguna on the pretext of the party wanted to send a message to his supporters and close leaders that he should be ready before the Lok Sabha elections
 congress main apni andekhi se naaraaz hokar hi bahuguna ne 2016 main baghawat kar di thi
 Obviously, this time there is a buzz in the BJP that Bahuguna should not take any drastic step for the party
 dinar party main mukhyamantri samet zyaadaatar ahm netaaon kaa shaamil hona bhi bataata he ki bhaajapa ne ise gambhirtha se liya he
 However, Trivendra Rawat termed this as a normal thing and said that no further implications should be drawn
 lekin dinar main tehri kii bhaajapa saansad maharani maala rajyalakshmi shah nahin pahunchin
 He has objected to the speculation that Bahuguna is claiming from Tehri
 rajyalakshmi ne kaha ki tehri se pehali daavedaari unki he
 Recently, BJP state president Ajay Bhatt had said that only five BJP mps will again contest the next Lok Sabha elections in the state
 lekin bahuguna kaa yah kahana ki ve chunaav ladenge yaa nahin, iskaa elaan march main karenge, bhatta ke bayaan par prashnchihn lagaataa he
 In such a situation, the storm in the BJP over Bahuguna's dinner party is not looking cold

 'sush, who first visited mathura-vrindavan, told a press conference,' My friend Vivek got his Radha by the grace of Thakur ji but i have not got my Krishna yet

 'before Sush's words could be interpreted, he made it clear that Vivek was going to marry a very nice girl
 sushmita ne kaha ki vah khud bhi ladki waalon kii ore se hi shaadi main shaamil hongi or rasm ke mutabik, vivek ke juute bhi churaaengi
 At this, Vivek told Tapak that if this happened, Sush would give whatever he asked for in return for the shoes
 haalanki, ek sawaal ke jawaab main sushmita ne saaf kiya ki unhen abhi apana krishna nahin mila he, jab milegaa to jarur bataanegi

 they deserve a 2nd chance and hopefully get the right support around them now 
 
 Takes a lot guts to do what they did today 
 
 — Michael Vaughan (@michaelvaughan)march 29, 2018haven't Australia made enough of a spectacle of Steve Smith? I'm blown by what he is being put through
 - Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) March 29, 2018 South African captain Faf du Plessis said that he felt the 12-month ban on Australian captain Steve Smith was quite 'tough'
 unhone johanisburg main media conference main kaha ki unhen smith ke liye bahut dukh he or unhone unke samarthan main ek sandesh bheja he
 Du Plessis himself has been convicted twice for ball tampering charges, but was fined only once and was never banned
 unhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki vah achche khilaadiyon main se ek he or vah bas sirf galat jagah funs gaya
 'du Plessis said,' i really feel heartbroken for them
 main khilaadiyon ko is daur se guzarate hue nahin dekhnaa chahta
 'the next few days will be very difficult for him, so i sent a message to support him that he will get out of this difficult period and he should be strong

 Smith is also accused of trying to mislead match officials and others
 goa ke mukhyamantri manohar parrikarka narendramodi cabinetmen shaamil hona tay ho chukaa he
 It is understood that the BJP will choose three names as their possible successors
 party ke ek varisht netaa ne shuukravaar ko yah jaankaree di
 a meeting of the BJP Legislature Party will be held in Porvorim on Friday to recommend the names of Deputy Chief Minister Francis d'souza, State Health Minister Laxmikant Parsekar and Assembly Speaker Rajendra Arlekar as Parrikar's successor
 in teenon naamon kii pushti karte hue party ke ek varisht padaadhikari ne kaha ki bijepi sansadeey board shanivaar ko nai dilli main apni baithak ke baad is bare main aupchaarik ghoshnaa karegaa
 Meanwhile, intense political discussions and meetings continued throughout the night in Goa's capital Panaji
 raat bhar bijepi ke sabhi vidhayak ek hotel main ekatra rahe
 However, after exiting the closed-door meeting late Thursday night, BJP state unit president Vinay Tendulkar said, "it is a matter of pride that Parrikar can be inducted into the cabinet and be made the defense minister of the country
" lekin hamen yahaan goa main unki kami nishchit rup se khalegi
 He refused to divulge the names chosen as a possible successor to Parrikar but said 'the post will be given to a competent person
 ’raksha mantri ke taur par niyukti kii sambhaavna ke bare main aa rahi khabaron par apni chuppi todate hue parrikar ne guuruuvaar ko kaha tha ki bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne unase kaha tha ki agar centre unhen koi jimmedaari detaa he to vah use uthaaen
 He then expressed his desire to take this responsibility on his shoulders
 goa main hue vidhansabha chunaavon main party ko jeet dilaane main ahm bhoomika nibhaane vaale bijepi ke 58 varshiya parrikar rajya kii raajnneeti se alag hone kii ghoshnaa karte hue bhavuk ho gaye
 He told reporters, 'I am distressed leaving the post
 lekin mere liye desh rajya se bada he
 i have a mixed feeling
 ’baad main shaam ko jab parrikar ne panaji main party ke kuch chuninda kaaryakartaaon se mulaakaat kii to unki ankhen chhalak padin
 Failing to control his feelings, Parrikar said in a brief address, 'I am going to Delhi because they have asked me to take up new responsibilities
 goa ko jab bhi jarurat hogi, main hameshaa uske liye uplabdh rahoonga
 "finishing the meeting, he said" If i speak more, i will become more emotional
 guuruuvaar der raat ek samachar channel se baatcheet ke dauraan parrikar ne kaha ki agar unhen dilli main nai jimmedaari ke liye chunaa jaataa he to unhen ‘fish kari rice’ kii bahut yaad aegi
 - input language sampradayikta ke khilaaf jhanda buland kar bihar chunaav main apni jameen pukhta karne vaale nitish kumaar ko aakhirkaar chunaavon ke elaan se thik pehle mandiron kii yaad aa gai he
 Not only this, the Chief Minister has once again played the card of caste politics in the state
 rajya cabinet ne haal hi do ahm faisle lete hue mandiron kii boundry nirmaan ke liye fund ko sweekruti di he, vahiin mallaah, nishad or nonia jati ko anusuchit jan jati main shaamil karne kaa nirnay kiya he
 It was approved in the state cabinet meeting on Saturday
 mallaah, nishad (bind, beldaar, chai, tiyar, khulwat, surihaya, godhi, vanapper va kevat) or nonia jati ko inke aarthik, raajnneetik, shaikshanik va rojgar main pichhadepan ko dekhte hue bihar kii anusuchit jan jati kii suchi main shaamil karne kii anushansa centre sarkaar ko bhejne kaa nirnay liya gaya
 The decision regarding the protection of temples has been confirmed by the Cabinet Secretary Shishir Sinha
 ek varisht jediu netaa ne sarkaar ke is kadam par pratikriya dete hue kaha, 'isse pehle masjidon ke chaaron ko baad nirmaan ke liye fund jari karanitish sarkaarne musalamaanon ko sandesh diya, vahiin ab mandiron ke liye aisa hi fund jari kar sarkaar bahusankhyak hinduon tak sandesh pahunchaana chaahati he
 However, Netaji also said that this decision should have been taken much earlier by the government
 kyonki mandiron kii jameen ko lekar vivaad kaa nipataara hone se samaaj main sahi sandesh bheja jaataa
 The government is of the view that this has been done in relation to the protection of temples
 bahumoolya dhatu yaa murti kii suraksha ke liye rajya ke sabhi dm ko aise mandiron ko chinhit karne kaa adhikaar diya gaya he
 On the dm's report, the Department of Building Construction will make the boundary walls
 ek karod se adhik kii aabaadi ko laabhnithish cabinet ke duusare faisle ko pradesh main jatigat sameekaran se jodakar dekha ja rahaa he
 It is interesting that while the police on Friday went on a protest march demanding the inclusion of the Nishad caste in the Scheduled Castes in the capital, the government passed it in its cabinet meeting the very next day
 sarkaar ke is faisle se takreeban ek karod se adhik kii aabaadi ko anusuchit jan jati ko milane vaali suvidhaon kaa laabh milegaa
 For a long time there was a demand for inclusion of Nishad, Mallah and Nonia caste in the Scheduled Castes
 iske pehle sarkaar ne lohaar jati ko anusuchit jati main or taili, tamoli or chaurasia jati ko ati pichhadi jati main shaamil karne kii manjuuri di
 Senior leader Sushil Kumar Modi has termed this move of the government as a conspiracy
 unhone kaha, 'yah or kuch nahin balki nishadon ko rijhaane kii sajeesh he
 They have not been given any benefit for the last 10 years
 nitish sarkaar nishadon ko dalit jati main kaise jod sakati he, jabaki yah ek sanvaidhanik tarika he or aisa centre dwaara sanshodhan ke jariye hi kiya ja saktaa he
 BJP leader and Muzaffarpur MP Ajay Nishad alleges that Nitish Kumar's government is using the Nishad community as football in the game of politics

 CAT has sent a letter to Prime Minister Modi today requesting that he start this campaign on October 2 from a market in Delhi where traders will voluntarily give him plastic bags and take an oath not to use single-use plastic
 cat ke rashtriya adhyaksh bisi bharatiyaa or rashtriya mahaamantri praveen khandelwal ne kaha ki vyapaaree aapurti shrinkhalaa kaa hissaa hai jo nirmaataaon se saamaan praapt karte hai or upabhoktaaon ko vitarit karte hai

 Therefore prohibiting the use of single-use plastics at the manufacturer's level is beyond the control of traders

 It was the day of 10 December 1988 when 15-year-old Kishore Sachin Tendulkar stepped onto the field to play a first-class match and hit his first century the next day
 iske baad tendulkar ke naam par shatak dar shatak judate rahe lekin 22 saal guzarane ke baad bhi shatakon ke badshaah ko pehle tihare shatak kaa intjaar he
 Tendulkar has made many batting records in his name in these 22 years but there are many records which will always remain out of his JD
 bhartiya ran mashin ne ab tak antarrashtriya cricket main 99, pratham shrenee cricket main 78 or teenon tarah ke praaroop main kul milakar 138 shatak jamaaye hai lekin inamen tihara shatak shaamil nahin he
 When Master Blaster was recently asked about this, his simple answer was that he also likes to score runs like every batsman and he also wants to score a triple century
 tendulkar haalanki vyaktigat uplabdhiyon par team ko hameshaa tarjeeh dete rahe hai
 Tendulkar's highest score in Test cricket is an unbeaten 248 which he made against Bangladesh in Dhaka in 2004
 yah pratham shrenee cricket main bhi unka ucchtam score he jiskaa matlab he ki yah star ballebaaj abhi tak kabhi 250 ran kii sankhya ko nahin chhu paaya he
 He has six double centuries in Test matches to his name but on some of these occasions he reached the position of scoring triple centuries
 bangladesh ke khilaaf jab unhone apane karier kaa sarvaadhik score banaaya tab puri team out ho gayi thi or vah duusare chor par naabad rahe the
 Tendulkar had a good chance of scoring a triple century against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2010 but was then dismissed for 203 runs
 bharat ne tab unke out hone ke baad bhi 100 se adhik ran banaae the
 However, when Tendulkar was only 14 years old, he scored a triple century in school cricket
 unhone sharadashram vidyamandir kii taraf se saint jevier skool ke khilaaf aaazaad maidan par naabad 326 ran kii pari kheli thi
 It was the same match in which Kambli and Tendulkar shared a record 664 runs
 tihara shatak to abhi tendulkar kii jad main he lekin kai aise record hai jinase ricardon ke badshaah milon peeche hai
 These include Jack Hobbs 'record for most runs (61760) and most centuries (199) in first-class cricket, Wilfred Rhodes' 30-year international career and 1110 first-class match play records, and Brian Lara's first-class (501) and Tests
 The record for the highest innings of the match (400 not out) is prominent
 tendulkar ne ab tak 280 pratham shrenee match khele hai jisamen unhone 23585 ran banaae hai
 This includes 78 centuries and 105 half-centuries
 pratham shrenee cricket main sarvaadhik ardhashatak frank wooli (295) ke naam par darj hai

 'land for railway hotel' scam main agar rashtriya janata dal (rajd) ke netaa lalu yadav ke saath unke bete tejasvi yadav kii giraftaar hoti he, to bihar kii nitish sarkaar main dipti siem ke post kaa kya hoga? ye sawaal sabake man main he
 In fact, it is suspected that Lalu and Tejashwi were named in the FIR filed by the CBI in the Land for Hotel case that the two leaders may be arrested
 rajd supremeo se jude sutron ke mutabiklalu ne kisi bhi sthiti se nipatane ke liye plan bi taiyaar kar liyaahai
 Under this plan, if the CBI arrests Tejashwi Yadav, then Lalu can place his elder son and Bihar Health Minister Tej Pratap Yadav on the post of Deputy CM instead of Tejashwi
 lalu ne banaaya plan-bihindustan times kii report ke mutabik rajd ke ek varisht netaa ne kaha ki agar padakram dekha jaae to swasthya mantri hone ke chalate tejpratap yadav is samay tisare number par hai
 He can be promoted to number two in any emergency
 naam na chhapane kii shart par unhone bataaya ki tej pratap yadav 'land for hotel' scam main aaropee nahin hai
 He clarified that apart from the Lalu family there can be no other Deputy Chief Minister in the Nitish government
 cabinet mantri ke baraabar kii is post ko november 2015 main bihar main mahagathbandhan kii sarkaar aane ke baad banaaya gaya tha
 Congress, Lalu and JDU are participants in the grand alliance

 However, BJP is constantly pushing Nitish Kumar to remove Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap Yadav
 shuukravaar ko hui press conference main khud tejasvi yadav ne is baat kii ore ishaara kiya
 On the other hand, RJD leaders confirmed it on Saturday
 rajd sutron ne kaha ki party kii ranneeti wet and watch kii he
 The party wants to see what decision Nitish Kumar takes on bjp's demand to remove both sons of Lalu from the Council of Ministers
 rajd netaa ne diya uma bharti kaa udhaahranek rajd netaa ne kaha, 'hamen nahin maaloom ki mukhyamantri sibiai kii ore se darj kii gai exiaar ke aadhaar par tejasvi kaa istipha maangate hai ki nahin
 But our stand is clear
 tejasvi yadav khud se istipha nahin denge
 The RJD leader pointed to Uma Bharti and said that despite having a charge sheet in the criminal case, the Union Minister remained in the post
 lalu ke beton ko lekar rajd ke spasht ravaiye ke baad aane vaale dinon main nitish kumaar kii mushkilen bad sakati hai
 This is the reason that JDU leaders are not saying anything about the CBI raid on Friday
 congress ne kiya lalu kaa samarthandilachasp ye he ki mahagathbandhan kii teesri party congress lalu yadav or unke parivaar ke sadasyon ke khule samarthan main he
 Bihar Congress President and Education Minister Ashok Chaudhary said on Saturday that when the deal was struck, Tejashwi Yadav was a minor, then why his name has been included in the FIR
 sutron ke mutabik 17 july ko hone vaale raashtrapati chunaavon ko dekhte hue rajd ke vidhayakon or saansadon kii jarurat congress ko he
 Therefore, the Congress is openly supporting the RJD

 BJP has met the Congress, Kejriwal also targeted the BJP, saying that the bjp's movement against electricity and water bills was just an election tactic and that it has got from the Congress itself
 unhone kaha, ‘logon par bilon kaa bhugtan karne ke liye dabaav banaaya ja rahaa he kyonki ve apane khilaaf kisi kanoonee karrwai se darate hai
 He said, 'my fast is aimed at mobilizing more and more people against illegal bills
 ’ kejariwal ne logon se apil kii ki vah bilon kaa bhugtan nahin karen
 He said that if more and more people do not pay the bills and take part in the 'civil Disobedience' movement then the government and power companies will not be able to take action against them
 dilli main bijli kii daron main kami kii maang kar rahe hai kejariwal lekin is anshan main unhen anna hajaare kaa saath nahin milegaa
 On the other hand, the Election Commission has given recognition to the Aam Aadmi Party

 The first phase of this movement, which begins on the martyrdom day of Bhagat Singh on 23 March, will be in Sundernagri by fasting

 He has appealed to the people of Delhi not to pay the electricity and water bills, and even if filled only half, Kejriwal also accused Sheila Dixit government of collusion with the power companies
 darasal aam aadmi party kii koshish he ki wo khud ko dilli kii janata ke haq kii asal pairokaar sabit kare
 There will be no demand from the government in the movement, but the effort is to make people stand against the Delhi government and with the Aam Aadmi Party

 The sealing happening in Delhi is going on the directions of the committee set up by the Supreme Court, but if anyone is getting the most criticism for it, then it is the MCD
 isi se bachane ke liye ab south emsidi ne bada kadam uthaate hue adhikariyon ko nirdesh die hai ki bina notice wo ceiling nahin karen
 The sealing issue was overshadowed during the southmcd Standing Committee meeting on Wednesday
 ceiling se vyapaariyon ko ho rahi pareshaani par congress or bijepi ne ek sur main ceiling kaa virodh kiya
 Congress party leader Abhishek Dutt said in the South MCD Standing Committee that "the sealing officers are themselves confused whether to take action as per the DMC Act or according to the Monitoring Committee"
 abhishek dutt ne bada aarope lagaate hue kaha ki " monitering cameti hitalarshahi kar rahi he"
 This was supported by Shikha Rai, a BJP councilor and member of the Standing Committee, but for this, the Congress was responsible for why the issue of sealing was not resolved during the government of Sheila Dixit
 isapar congress parshad abhishek dutt ne palatwaar karte hue kaha kii 15 saal se emsidi membijapi kii sarkaarhai to usne ab tak kya kiya? iske baad sthaayee samiti adhyaksh bhupendra gupta ne kaha ki diemasi act main likhaa he ki ceiling se pehle kam se kam 48 ghante kaa notice dena zaruri he, aise main ham apane adhikariyon se bolengen ki wo ceiling se pehle notice den
 Bhupendra Gupta said that the all-party councilor of South MCD would go and meet Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri and appeal that there should be no ceiling till at least 30 June 2018 and people get a chance to submit conversion charges
 chhatarpur main farm house hua di-silbhupendra gupta ne bataaya ki kuch din pehle chhatarpur ilaake main monitering cameti ke nirdesh par ramaya farmahouse ko sil kiya gaya tha, use asthai taur par disil kiya gaya he kyonki vahaan par pehle se shaadiyon kii booking thi
 Based on this, the Standing Committee has directed that the dcs of the zone, who have all the documents, help them and meet the Monitoring Committee to decile their shops as there are many sealed properties which have raw material inside
 Or there is something which can go bad, in such a situation, their shops can be permanently decontaminated and there is no minimum loss
 dharna dena padaa to denge: bhupendra guptadilli main ho rahi ceiling se emsidi ke upar kitna dabaav he iskaa andaaza isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki sthaayee samiti adhyaksh bhupendra gupta ne is masale par monitering cameti ke daftar par dharne dene tak ki baat kar daali
 However, later he said that he would first talk to top leaders in the party on this issue

 desiraju kehete hai, ''iskaa uddeshy yah tha ki ham zyada se zyada behatar logon ko achche paise par rakh saken
 "for some time, the ministry has been trying to bring the ITSU under its control and this process has been reported as a" relationship breakdown "

 "he needed technical support - some people who understand vaccines, have knowledge of their supply chain, adverse conditions and the data they collect

 Vijayaraghavan says, "we should keep in mind that such baseless allegations are made by some errant and enthusiastic people
" ham sab ko apni raay rakhane or prasaarit karne kaa adhikaar he
 Despite this, the problem can be serious if the unfounded claims that create fear are not rigorously tested
 "tike jindagi bachaate hai
 Those who consistently obstruct decisions with unfounded and inflexible arguments, despite harsh evaluations at every stage, will also have to be rigorously rigged as everyone ultimately has a human life

 In Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party has spoken of passing its own Jan Lokpal law of the capital at Ramlila Maidan within 15 days of forming its government, but is it possible to do so
 jaankaron kaa kahana he nahin
 He says that the Lokayukta Act in Delhi needs the consent of the Center before it is taken to the Assembly, so it is impossible for Arvind Kejriwal to live up to his promise
 kya anna ke lokapal kaa virodh karne vaale arvind kejariwal dilli kaa siem banane ke baad bhi apane man mutabik jan lokapal paas karvaa paaenge? kya chunaavon main shapath lene ke 15 dinon ke bheetar ramlila maidan main vidhansabha kaa satr is vidheyak ko paas karne ke liye bulaayaa ja sakegaa? in saare sawaalon ke jawaab jaankaron ke mutabik 'naa' main he
 The reason is that Delhi is not a complete state at all
 dilli vidhansabha ke purv sachiv es ke sharma ne kaha, na to ramlila maidan main baithak ho sakati he or na hi bina centre kii manjuuri ke dilli main lokapal bill vidhansabha main pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 In fact, Kejriwal's claim seems to be lacking because Delhi is not free to make its own Lokayukta bill like other states
 dilli main ab bhi centreshasit pradesh kii tarah hi kanoon lagu hota he, isliye lokayukta kaa kanoon taiyaar karke dilli cabinet kii manjuuri ke baad use pehle uparajyapal karyaalay ke jariye kendriya grih mantralay ko manjuuri ke liye bhejnaa jaruri hoga
 After consultations with the Home Ministry, Law Ministry and the rest of the concerned ministries, the Lokayukta Bill will be sent back to the Delhi Government through the Lieutenant Governor with necessary amendments, only after which it will be brought for the approval of the Legislative Assembly
 is puri prakriya main kai maheenon kaa vakt lag saktaa he, isliye kejariwal daawa bhale kar rahe hon, lekin ye sab itnaa aasaan nahin he
 In the past, many claims of the Aam Aadmi Party have been put in question
 aise main wo lakayukta kanoon party ke liye pehali agni pariksha sabit hoga, jo unki fehrist main abtak sabase upar rahaa he
 a few days after the undertrials were stabbed and murdered, two convicts were found dead under tight security in Tihar Jail under tight security

 One of the two convicts was serving a life sentence

 Prison officials suspect that both died after consuming a narcotic substance, which was secretly brought to the prison

 He also advised both of them not to do so, saying that it was harmful
 lekin donon ne baat nahin maani
 His condition worsened in the morning
 ’unhone bataaya, ‘adhikariyon ne jail doctoron ko bulaayaa, jinhone unhen bachaane kaa prayaas kiya, lekin jab unhen mahasoos hua ki unhen or dekhbhaal kii jarurat he, to unhen didiu aspataal main bheja gaya, jahaan unhen subah saadhe nau baje ke kareeb mrit ghoshit kar diya gaya
 After the incident, the head warder responsible for the security of the prison in which the two prisoners were found dead was suspended and a magistrate ordered an inquiry

" main vishwa cap ke bare main soch rahaa hum or hamaara pehla abhyaas match aath saptaah baad hona he
 i would like to participate in the ODI tri-series but i have to wait
 aisi bhi sambhaavna he ki main phir kabhi nahin khel paaun
 He said, "I hope that will not happen in this case and i will leave no stone unturned to come back but i also have to be realistic

 Whenever i can't play any match for Australia, it hurts

 He said, 'it is definitely very special
 australia kii taraf se aap jo bhi test match khelte ho aapako usamen apni ji jaan laga dete ho lekin yah shrinkhalaa hamaare dil ke kaaphi kareeb he
 There is no doubt that we will always remember this first Test match in our career
 maine apni jindagi main jitne bhi test khele unamem yah sabase mahatvapurn tha
 Clarke said, 'I am very happy with the way the players performed
 unka yahaan pahunchane ke baad pehle din se hi ravaiya bejod tha
 There were some challenges mentally and the players faced them during the match
 bharat kii behtareen team ke khilaaf apni sarvshereshth cricket khelnaa yah vastav main khaas he
 Clarke also praised Indian captain Kohli, who hit centuries in both innings
 unhone kaha, ‘yah shandaar jeet he or kuch asaadhaaran pradarshan dekhne ko mili
 This is one of the best centuries of the second innings i have seen
 kuch shandaar pradarshan hue
 The captaincy of Nathan Lyon, David Warner and Brad Haddin in the final season were unmatched

 suraksha kaarnon se buudhvaar ko videshi mediakarmiyon ke ek chaar sadasyeey dal ko jharkhand ke latehar jile se waapas ranchi bhej diya gaya
 These people had not given prior notice to the administration
 latehar jila ke police adheekshak kranti kumaar ke anusaar ye log kuch aantarik ilaakon main janaa chaahate the lekin iske liye unhone pehle se soochna nahin di thi

 dilli ke mukhyamantri or aam aadmi party ke sanyojak arvind kejariwal par apane mantri satyendra jain se do karod rupee kii ghoose lene ke aarope lagane vaale aap netaa kapil mishra ab khud bhi sawaalon se ghirte ja rahe hai
 The big question arises from the contradiction of the statements made by him in the last two days
 mishra ke aaropon kii sachai to jaanch ke baad hi saamne aa sakegi lekin is mudde par jis tarah aam aadmi party main wo alag-thalag pade hai, usase unke daanv ke ulate padane kii sambhaavna zyada ban rahi he
 Actually, after being removed from the minister yesterday, Kapil Mishra had tweeted that he will make a big disclosure on the tanker scam tomorrow i
e
 on Sunday, but on Sunday when he came in front of the media, he did not take the name of the tanker scam but he directly Kejriwal was accused of accepting a bribe of Rs 2 crore from his minister Satyendar Jain
 kal hi kapil mishra ne twit kiya tha ki unhone arvind kejariwal se mulaakaat kar party ke andar chal rahe karpshan kii jaankaree mukhyamantri ko di thi or ravivaar ko wo ye jaankaree janata ke saamne rakhenge
 But on Sunday, Kapil accuses Kejriwal of corruption, in such a situation the question arises whether Kapil Mishra is trying to say that he met Kejriwal and gave him explosive information that the Chief Minister took two crores from Satyendar Jain? Five questions are necessary to ask Kapil Mishra also
 click-read-yesterday Kapil Mishra himself tweeted that he gave important facts related to corruption to Kejriwal during the day, which will be revealed tomorrow
 sawaal ye he ki aakhir wo mahatvapurn tathy hai kya? aam aadmi party or uske netaa kejariwal ke bachaav main kapil kii isi chook ko hilite kar rahe hai
 In conversation with Aaj Tak, AAP leader Ashutosh also raised the same contradiction of Kapil Mishra's allegations
 kya antim samay main badali kapil ne ranneeti?kapil ne kejariwal or satyendra jain par do karod kii ghoose kaa sansanikhej aarope to lagaaya lekin sawaal uth rahe hai ki aakhir tanker ghotaale par unhone koi khulaasa kyon nahin kiya? kapil mishra ne jo aarope lagaae bhi hai unhen bhi sabit karnaa unke liye mushkil hoga
 Questions are arising that at the same time when he saw these two crores of rupees, why not call the Income Tax Department or other agencies and get Kejriwal caught red handed? At the time when this alleged transaction was taking place, was there any fourth person present there who could test it? When Kapil Mishra was asked how he found out that the amount was two crores, he said that himself Satyendra Jain told him that Jain told him how much amount he had, but did not tell where he came from and for what purpose
 sawaal ye bhi uth rahe hai ki kya media main kapil mishra ne jo khulaasa kiya usee ke bare main wo pichley do din se baat kar rahe the yaa antim samay main unhone apni ranneeti badal di? Trading closed at a rapid pace in the domestic stock markets

 On Tuesday morning, Shatrughan tweeted that as a Member of Parliament in Patna, people there are asking me the price of petrol-diesel, farmers' strike, Kashmir policy, issues of judges and defeat in by-elections

 Not strange, this is not a future fantasy in any of George Orwell's novels
 yah aaj kachinhai
 No country is growing faster in terms of being equipped with Big Data and AI to power its industries
 zyaadaatar visheshgyon kaa maananaa he ki yah agali takneekee lahar banane ja rahi he
 In September last year, Beijing formulated a plan to use AI technology in various fields, from education to transportation
 china eani takanic par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kar rahaa he
 Now the new "made in China" means "made inchina" for people in India generally means fake goods, cheap toys, and electric appliances
 par sachaai ekadam alag he
 For example, humans have been replaced by robots at a factory in Xian, where the world's most advanced laser diodes are being manufactured
 guijhaau main china duniya kaa sabase bada big data centre bana rahaa he
 Internet companies, starting with startups at Beijing's technology center Zhongqunqun, are now among the world's largest companies
 kamai ke lihaaj se duniya kii das sabase badi internet companiyon main chaar china kii hai—i-commers kii diggaj company jedy or alibaba, tencent jo soshal media ap ''vichet" se judi he, or bidu jisane search ingine ke taur par shuruyaat kii thi or ab eani ke kshetra main aage bad rahi he or isamen khaas tarah kii kaaren bhi shaamil hai
 India has only one Flipkart in 25 major companies of the world
 china main 70 karod se zyada internet yujar hai—bharat se do guna
 China is rapidly growing in the direction of America's equalization in the technical field and the gap between the two is steadily reducing
 khaskar eani ke kshetra main china ke badhate kadamon se satark hokar baraak obama prashasan ne ek neshnal artificial intelligence research and deveopment stratagic yojana banaai thi jisane paaya ki eani research kaa rujhaan ''duniya main badhata ja rahaa he or prakaashan sankhya ke maamle main america ab aage nahin rah gaya he

 "tu Zaipai, former Alibaba president, says," The gap between China and America is shrinking
 eani ke kshetra main leader banane ke liye china ke paas acha mauka he
 "he says that China is in a very good position to take the next big step in the field of technology
 vichet kii peedichin main do sabase badi digital pahal alibaba or tencent kii vichet ne kii he
 wechat has over one billion users
 alibaba ne kaarobaar kaa puraa kayapalat kar diya he or vichet duniya main sabase anokhaa soshal media plateform he
 It is wrongly defined as whatsapp of China
 darasal, yah whatsap se kahin zyada aadhunik he
 It started using voice and video a year before whatsapp
 ek tarah se yah kuch had tak whatsap, fasebuk or petm kaa mila-jula rup he—isamen yujar photograph, messej post kar sakate hai or i-wolet kii tarah iskaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 This reporter found that you can pay electricity and gas bills by simply buying a movie ticket in Beijing and ordering a taxi without having to put a penny of cash in your pocket
 tu kehete hai, ''vichet har din 10 karod photo taiyaar karata he
 Naturally, Tencent is the most capable of developing facial recognition technology
 or is tarah yah ek eani company kaa rup le sakati he
 "AI" leads the major companies using AI in racing
 yah autonomas kaaren viksit kar rahaa he
 "we want to use AI and Big Data to completely change society," says Wu Gunshaw, its co-founder and CEO
 trephic jam se lekar durghatnaon, vaayu pradooshan se lekar shaharon kii ruparekha tak autonamas kaaren samaaj kii samasyaayein dur karne main bahut kuch kar sakati hai
 Our driverless cars have been in Hong Kong for three months and there has not been a single accident yet
 "vu hongjhau ke prayog ko deshvyapee banane ke liye sarkaar ke saath kaam kar rahe hai or maanate hai ki china ab america ke mukaable zyada teji se aage bad rahaa he
 He says, "I have been involved in many conversations with the Ministry of Industry and IT
 unka maananaa he ki autonamas kaaren smart shaharon kaa abhinn hissaa hai
 China plans to build 1,000 new cities by 2020
 is tarah hamaare paas 1,000 nae shahar honge jo autonamas kaaron ke anukool honge
 "kaifu Li, formerly head of Google China and now head of an ai-focused investment firm, says China's AI industry is" the world's leader "

 If you do well, you can buy back shares from the government
 agar nahin karte hai to sarkaar aapke nuksaan kii bharpai kar sakati he
 "if the first wave was the Internet," Lee says, the second wave is to use AI in business that has digitized data
 china apni eani niti ke tahat banking se lekar healthcare or parivahan tak sabhi kshetron main iskaa istemaal kar rahaa he
 The third wave, he says, is now of robotics and autonomous vehicles where China is dominating

 10 saal puraani yah company unnat kism ke lager utpaadon kaa nirmaan karti he jinka istemaal antariksh sector se lekar soochna-praudyogiki or jivan vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 China's success in manufacturing is supporting its progress in AI and other areas
 ''maid in china 2025" yojana ke tahat smart menuphaccharing main ek kranti aane vaali he
 In pursuing the plan, China contacted focuslight founder Victor Liu, who was reluctant to return home after leaving Silicon Valley in 2006
 us samay tak china menuphaccharing main bahut aage nikal chukaa tha lekin nae prayogon ke maamle main pashchim se kaaphi peeche tha
 Liu was part of the first batch of government programs that tried to bring some talent back to their country, just like India
 chinis academy of sciensej kii madad se liyu ne focuslite kii shuruyaat kii jo unnat lager diod banaati thi or paanch saal se bhi kam samay main vah america or europea diggaj companiyon ko takkar dene lagi thi
 This company became the third most advanced company in the world in its field
 liyu kehete hai, ''log yah nahin jaanate ki menuphaccharing nae prayogon kii kunjee he
 This gives you new ideas from manufacturing how to design and produce a product
 main yah bataa nahin saktaa ki echosystem, niti or prashasan kitna mahatvapurn hota he

 kadi nigaranechin ke digital raashtra banane kii koshish ko ek-daleey satta dwaara apane saamaajik dabadabe ko barkaraar rakhane ke ek nirnaayak hathiyaar ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 In November last year, a video went viral in China
 isamen darshaya gaya ki sarkaar chini company dwaara taiyaar chehre ko pahchaanane kii takanic kaa istemaal kar rahi he jisase vyastatam trephic chairaahe se guzar rahe har vyakti ko uske aaidi number se pahchaan liya gaya
 According to the CEO of the company called Senseface, it is being used in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangdong, Sichuan and Hainan and it found 69 criminals / suspects from the same city within 40 days
 skynet ek rashtravyapee system he jiske eani feechar se las lakhon camere trephic niyamon kaa ulanghan karne waalon or aparaadhiyon par paini najar rakhte hai
 These cameras are installed in the streets
 haalanki sarkaar kahati he ki isse aparaadh rukegaa par isse logon kii niztaa bhi bhang hoti he
 The lesson for India is the common belief in India that China is the master of making fake and cheap goods
 china kii tarakkee ko is nazariye se aankate hue use khaarij kar dene kii pravriti khatarnaak siddh ho sakati he
 "I don't think anyone would have thought 15 years ago that four of the 10 biggest Internet companies would be from China," says Kaiser Kuo, who was associated with Chinese giant Baidu for 2016
 "kuo ke mutabik, logon main ek bhranti he ki china hi ekmaatr desh he jo apni companiyon ke liye videshon se milane vaali chunauti ke raste hi band kar detaa he
 "twitter was blocked in 2009, and Google exited in March 2010, but by that time, these companies were far behind their rivals
" "kuo kehete hai ki china kii digital arthvyavastha ke kuch sabak hai jo navachaar ke paaramparik gyaan par sawaal khadey karte hai
 Even the story of America indicates how big a contribution the government can make in creating the right environment to flourish
 ''silicon vaili ko khadaa hone main raksha vibhaag ne kis had tak jaakar yogadan diya he, yah baat kisi se chhipi nahin he
 The Internet is the first example of this
 raste se hat jane se jude nirnyon main, kar nitiyaan banane main, buniyadi dhaancha khadey karne main, bahaaliyon ko protsaahan dene main or chini udhyamiyon ko waapas laane se jude nirnyon main, china kii sarkaar ne badi sooyeeboojh kaa parichay diya he
 "shashank Reddy, who studies AI policy in Carnegie India, agrees," As far as the data is concerned, India's position is the same as China — 1
 3 arab log aadhaar main panjiyan kara chuke hai
 The problem is that nobody has been able to use them properly till now
 hamaare paas google yaa bidu nahin he jo vishwasaneey eani system khadaa karne ke liye data taiyaar karenge
 The history of the greatest discovery in the field of technology of our era shows how much support and support has been given by the government in taking it to its end
 "centre sarkaar ne ab isaki ahmiyat ko samajha he
 For the first time, the budget of Digital India has been doubled to Rs 3,000 crore in the Union Budget
 kiya gaya he or eani, robotics or mashin larning jaisi chizon par charchaa hui he, haalanki isko lekar vyapak niti kii ab tak pratiksha hi he
 With the formation of a new task force to implement AI for national security and defense needs by the Ministry of Defense on 2 February, there are indications that the importance of AI for national security is now being understood
 task force main nijee or sawarjanik kshetra, donon ek saath aae hai or tata sans ke en
 Chandrasekaran will preside over it
 iske raksha anusandhan evam shodh santhaan (diardio), sarkaar or shaikshanik sansthaaon ke adhikari, iity tathaa carnegi ke reddy iske sadsy honge
 It is clear that the rise of digital China is pointing to the need to move from the mode of traditional knowledge to some new amazing experiments

 If Bihar police are to be believed, it would be better to concentrate on registering cases against them rather than preventing the protesters from committing uproar and sabotage

 Because in the elections, only one independent and two other mlas came apart from congress-jds, BJP had no option but to make a dent in congress-jds mlas

 rajyapal ke aamantran ke badkumaraswami 23 may ko shapathgrahankarenge
 After this they will have to prove majority in the House

 main kah saktaa hum ki yadi atyadhik suraksha hui to uski samiksha kii jaae or kam kii jaae
 But there is no unnecessary protection
 ’ haalanki unhone is baat ko lekar bhi saavdhaan kiya ki jab bhi kisi vyakti kaa suraksha kavach hataaya jaataa he to us par jaanaleva hamale ke prayaas hote hai

 IPS Gaurav Tiwari transferred from Katni has shown his tough stance on corruption as soon as he moves to his new district
 unke taaja aadesh ne chhindwara jile ke thana prabhariyon kii neend uda di he
 Actually till now, the policemen or officers concerned used to take action on taking bribe, but IPS Gaurav Tiwari has now issued an order to all the police in-charge of the district, saying that if any staff of his police station is found taking bribe with him The police station in-charge will also be suspended
 espi gaurav tiwari ne 21 janvari ko jari aadesh main likhaa he, 'samast thana prabharee chhindwara ko suchit kiya jaataa he ki aapke thanantargat staff or chaowkee ke kisi bhi adhikari yaa karmchaaree ko lokayukta dwaara trep kiya jaataa he, to sambandhit thana prabharee kii sanliptata maanakar tatkaal sambandhit thana prabharee ko nilambit kar kathor dandatmak karrwai kii jaaegi
 'in Katni, there was a crackdown on corruption
 IPS Gaurav Tiwari was a junkatnisp, then he is credited with exposing the Rs 500 crore hawala business there
 haal hi main jab unka tabadalaa katni se chhindwara kiya gaya to puraa katni shahar sadakon par utar aayaa tha or sarkaar se tiwari ko waapas katni espi banane kii maang kii thi
 In the city of Katni for about a week, IPS was in support of Tiwari

 The government is not considering a complete ban on exchange of old notes
 sarkari adhikariyon kii ore se yah safai tab ai he jab shuukravaar ko hi kuch sarkari sutron ne kaha tha ki sarkaar ko lagata he ki note badalane ke prastaav kaa galat phayda uthaaya ja saktaa he or yah 'banking system main baadha' paidaa kar saktaa he
 It has been said by the government that 'no such step will be taken which will create panic among the public
 'tippaniyan Let us know that since the note ban has been taken, some related news has shown that the same person is coming again and again to change the 500 and 1000 rupee notes
 is vajah se jo jaruratmand hai unhen paisa nahin mil paa rahaa he
 After banning five hundred and thousand rupee notes, the government had said that these old notes should be deposited in the bank by the end of the year
 uske baad ghoshnaa kii gai ki philhal ke liye chaar hazaar rupee tak ke puraane noton ko paanch sau or 2 hazaar rupee ke nae noton se badla ja saktaa he
 This week this limit was increased to Rs 4500 which was increased to Rs 2000 on Thursday
 vitt mantralay ke adhikariyon ne mana he ki iske saboot dekhne ko mili hai ki nae note lene ke liye kisi or ke liye koi or lag rahaa he yaa phir ek hi vyakti baar baar line main lag rahaa he
 Most economic experts have supported the intention of the government to take this decision, but at the same time, it is also believed that most of the circumstances are showing that the government was not ready to implement this decision and did not know that people To what extent can the problem be faced
 bataa den ki jab se notebandi kaa faisla liya gaya he uske baad se kuch sambandhit khabaron main dikhaaya gaya he ki kis tarah 500 or 1000 rupee ke note badalane ke liye ek hi vyakti baar baar aa rahaa he
 Because of this, those who are needy are not getting money
 paanch sau or hazaar rupee ke noton par bain lagane ke baad sarkaar ne kaha tha ki in puraane noton ko saal ke ant tak bank main jamaa karvaa diya jaae
 It was then announced that for the present, old notes of up to four thousand rupees can be replaced with new notes of five hundred and two thousand rupees
 isi hafte is seemaa ko badhaakar 4500 rupee kar diya gaya tha jise guuruuvaar ko 2000 rupee kar diya gaya
 Officials of the Finance Ministry have admitted that evidence has been found that someone else is looking for someone to take new notes or that the same person is repeatedly in line
 zyaadaatar aarthik jaankaron ne sarkaar ke is faisle lene ke peeche kii niyat kaa samarthan kiya he lekin saath hi yah bhi mana he ki zyaadaatar halaat yah dikhaa rahe hai ki sarkaar is faisle ke kriyanvayan ko lekar taiyaar nahin thi or use andaaza nahin tha ki logon ko kis had tak pareshaani kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he

 On one hand Delhiites are struggling with water shortage and people are upset with the increased bill
 vahiin duusari taraf dilli jal board kai sarkari mahakamon ko revadiyaan baantne main laga he
 According to the information received from RTI, the Delhi Jal Board owes crores of rupees to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the Central Government and the Electricity Department

 isamen se 72 karod rupee saal 2017 se 2018 kaa bakaayaa he or dilli police ne ab tak 12 karod rupee hi chuktaa kiye hai
 Railway is in the forefront of drinking water of Jal Board
 railway ab tak dilli jal board kaa 1933 karod rupee kaa pani pi chukaa he
 Of this, 333 crore rupees are this year and the shocking thing is that the Railways has paid only 7 crore rupees out of such dues, which are equal to cumin in the mouth of the camel
 iske saath hi health department par 434 karod rupee kaa bakaayaa he, jisamen se jal board ko sirf 2 karod rupee hi chuktaa kiye gaye hai
 When he spoke to Dinesh Mohania, vice chairman of Delhi Jal Board on this matter, he told that several times all these departments have been asked to deposit the arrears by issuing notices, but even after this, there are still crores of rupees
 dinesh mohaniya ne ye bhi bataaya ki kai baar in vibhaagon ke saath meeting bhi kii gai he, taaki jal board ke bakaayaa ko waapas liya jaae, lekin emsidi har baar paise naa hone kaa ronaa hi roti rahati he

 There have been so many incidents of defection that it is difficult to count
 yahaan tak ki mukhyamantri tak ne apni party kaa daaman chhod diya
 But there is no need to be shocked, the reason for all the ups and downs is the coming assembly and Lok Sabha elections
 andhra pradesh punargathan vidheyak 2013 ne congress ko dakshin ke us pradesh main apana vajood banaae rakhane main kaamyaab to kar hi diya jo kabhi uskaa garh tha, saath hi uski mukhya pratidwandvi telugudesham ke liye alag tarah kii musiibat bhi khadi kar di he

 8 fisadi logon ne mana ki viesar congress hi andhra ke bantwaare ke khilaaf abhiyaan kii vaastavik agua rahi he
 Jagan is aware of this
 isi kaaran unhone congress ke khilaaf chaaron ore se jabardast hamalaa bol diya he
 At a time when the credit of the Congress in Andhra has gone through Partition, Jagan has been calling himself a victim of discriminatory politics, from raising the issue of Sonia Gandhi's foreign origin to further brightening his position
 telugana raashtra samiti (tiares) bhi chaun kii bansi baja rahi he kyonki usne to apni jang jeet lee he
 The survey shows that 57

 For this reason TRS chief K

 The Congress will suffer the most damage in today's era

 In such a situation, the Congress will be satisfied with the loincloth of the running ghost

 With the approval of the President, the 58-year-old dream of four crore people will also come true
 lekin iske saath samasyaayein bhi judi hai
 Issues such as government jobs, development schemes, educational institutions and water sharing will have to be sorted out

 Telangana will have to prepare several projects for irrigation and then the issue of water sharing will have to be resolved

 The policy of equal opportunity in Hyderabad may not appeal to the youth of Telangana and they may make it an issue

 com / kbj9sfyoja— Melinda Farrell (@melindafarrell)july 22, 2017 At that time when Rajesh Khanna's golden romance was speaking to the heads of the people, there was a little uneasiness in the society
 bechaini isliye kyonki aazaadee ke baad kaa khumaar utar chukaa tha
 Rajesh Khanna was born in a super hit film like Aradhana
 khanna kaa romance logon ko patharilii duniya se dur le jaataa, yahaan logon ne parade par barish ke baad sunsaan makaan main do javaan dilon ko aag jalaakar phir vah sab kuch karte dekha, jo sirf unke khwaabon main tha
 Rajesh Khanna captivated people in his 4-year-old superstardom, but the society was swearing on screen with love stories like fairy tales
 is tarah kaa palaayanwaad zyada tikaoo hota nahin
 So, this palace of cards just needed a blow
 darshak baichaiyn tha
 On the same day, after the unsuccessful attempts of romance on screen, a rebellious attitude was seen by people, known as Amitabh Bachchan
 mahangaai, berojgaare, bhrashtachar or pangu hoti vyavastha se ladane ke liye ek buland awaz kii zarurat thi
 In such a situation, the tall boy's loud voice started echoing on the screen
 is noujvaan ke paas itnaa dam tha ki vah vyavastha se khud loha le sake or kuddaari itani ki phenke hue paise tak nahin uthaata
 The angry eyes gave a new look to the restless hawkish and cynical-rebellious voice
 us vakt jab desh jamkhori, kalabazari or thekedaaron-sahukaaron ke gathjod tale pis rahaa tha, bachchan ne zanjeer or diwaar jaisi filmon ke zarie naujavaanon ke gusse ko parade par saakaar kar diya
 This man, known as Vijay, was a young man who was fighting for justice, and if he does not get justice, he jumps into the field alone
 kuch log to itnaa tak kehete he ki amitabh ke nibhaae isi gussevar noujvaan kirdaar ne sattar ke dashak main ek badi kranti kii raah roak di
 But with the changing times, the character of this young man also changed
 zanjeer main usulon ke liye sab-inspector kii naukari chhod dene vaala noujvaan film dev tak adhed ho jaataa he
 The friend that sub-inspector gets in the chain is also awesome
 uske liye yaari, imaan kii tarah hoti he
 However, Amitabh's anger was also typed by the coolie, revolution
 jab bhi is amitabh ne khud ko yaa apni aawaaj ko kisi main aaazaad hum main yaa agnipath main badalanaa chaha, logon ne sweekaar nahin kiya
 So due to this lack of newness, Amitabh did not like the Red King, Matyudata, and Kohram who came back with the old cats and the same guns
 vajah- udaarikaran ke daur main bhartiya janata kaa maanas badal gaya tha
 Now people had money to spend, so why should they express anger over the issue of bread
 umr main aayaa badlaav usulon main bhi badlaav kaa sabab ban gaya
 In Dev, this principle changes as soon as the youngster becomes the Police Commissioner, and he becomes a compromise
 lekin amitabh jaise abhinayta ke liye, bhartiya samaaj main yah do alag-alag tasveeron kii tarah nahin dikhti
 The two are so mixed up in each other that the actor and the person Amitabh look the same
 jab abhinayta amitabh kuch kar guzarataa he to logon ko vaastavik jivan kaa amitabh yaad rahata he or jab asal kaa amitabh kuch karata he to parde kaa uskaa charitra saamne dikhataa he
 The way Amitabh's character has changed with the market is also a shocking change in itself
 jab ‘diwaar ke ek bachche ne kaha ki use phenkakar die hue paise manzur nahin, paise usko haath main die jaaen, to logon ne koob taaliyaan bajaain
 Many people felt that this is how to live with self-respect
 phir usee amitabh ne logon ke saamne paise fank-phenkakar kaha, ‘lo, karodpati ho jaao
 'some people had this Amitabh Akhar, but most people also liked this Amitabh who was standing in the market
 apni filmon ke saath aaj amitabh har mumkin cheez bech rahe hai
 He urges the audience to buy oil, incense sticks, polio drops, paints, insurance and cola
 karen bhi kyon na, aakhir unki ek chhavi he or unhen apni chhavi ko bhunaane kaa puraa haq he
 The viewer listens to half of what an elderly person talks and gives half as well
 baharhaal, amitabh bachchan ne apni filmon ke saath jo vigyaapan kiye usamen bazaar ke saath or chalan ke saath unka khadaa hona spasht dikhataa he
 Along with selling comb-glass-oil in the advertisement, Amitabh also played his political friendship
 ek taraf ve kamitment or majaburi ke tahat polio ke brands ambeseder bane to duusari taraf uttar pradesh ko uttam pradesh bataane kaa kaam bhi kiya
 (this pillow work is done by the socialists) And then with the changing times, Amitabh changed his face by not letting up
 ab ve darshakon se guzarish karte hai ki kuch din to guzaariye gujarat main
 However, in Amitabh Bachchan's worst films, no one has complained about Amitabh's performance
 tufaan, jaadugar se lekar aks, nishabd, teen
 
 kisi bhi film kaa naam lijie, amitabh kaam ke samay or kaam ko lekar paband rahe hai

 Political rulers are the most powerful and often in a very shameless manner also become indiscreet
 patna nagar nigam (piemasi) ke 34 varshiya kamishnar kuldeep narayan ko yah sabak bade kadave tareeke se seekhney ko mila he
 The government of Jitan Ram Manjhi issued the order for suspension of this 2005 batch IAS officer on December 12, while the Patna High Court had in July last year stayed Narayan's transfer till the final settlement of cases related to illegal constructions in the city
 narayan ke nilamban ko unase mukti paane ke sarkaar ke paroksh tareeke ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he kyonki ste kii vajah se sarkaar sidhe taur par yani tabadalaa ke jariye unhen nahin hataa sakati thi
 But when the issue of Narayan's suspension was raised before the Patna High Court, Justice V
 en
 Sinha and Justice P
 ke
 Jha's bench also stayed the suspension on 15 December
 court ne kaha ki nilamban or tabadalaa, donon kaa hi aashay adhikari ko hataane se he, jis par adaalat ne pehle hi roak laga rakhi he
 Both judges termed Narayan's suspension as 'malafide'
 yah khandpeeth rajdhani main kukuramute kii tarah failati ja rahi oonchi imaaraton ke khilaaf janhit yachika kii sunwaayee kar rahi he
 The Urban Development and Housing Department has recommended Narayan's suspension, accusing him of not implementing the Patna Solid Waste Management Project, inadequate fogging that led to dengue, non-utilization of funds and spreading politics in PMC
 saamaanya prashasan vibhaag ne mukhyamantri kii rajamandi ke baad narayan ke nilamban ke aadesh jari kar die
 This suspension order forced the attention of many people as the JD (U) governments of Jeetan Ram Manjhi and Nitish Kumar before them have often shown considerable leniency towards officials who have made serious mistakes in the past
 maanjhi sarkaar ne is saal aktubar main patna bhagdad main 33 logon ke maare jane kii ghatana ke baad bhi mahaj kuch afasaron kaa tabadalaa kiya tha or unhen bhi jald hi nai niyuktiyaan mil gai thim
 high level inquiry committee headed by Chief Home Secretary Amir Subhani specifically pointing out the serious administrative flaws responsible for the stampede
 november 2012 main bhi chhath parv ke maukey par patna main isi tarah kii bhagdad main 19 logon kii maut ke baad bhi naukarshahon ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kii gai thi
 Even after the incident of the death of 23 innocent children by consuming pesticide poisonous food at the mid-day meal in Saran in July 2013, the government neither transferred the District Magistrate nor senior officials of the concerned departments
 july 2013 main bodhgaya main hue visphot or aktubar 2013 main patna visphot ke baad bhi rajya sarkaar naukarshahon ke prati udaar bani rahi isliye badi agambhir-si vajahon par narayan ko nilambit karne kaa uskaa aadesh sabko sann kar gaya he
 It is broadly understood that this order of suspension has been given under pressure from the building mafia just 10 months before the state assembly elections
 eemaandaar adhikari maane jane vaale narayan patna main taqatvar bilders lobby ke khilaaf lagaataar sakriy the
 In the past, his orders had adversely affected many powerful figures, including the controversial JD (U) and Bahubali MLA Anant Singh
 bilders ke khilaaf unke sakht kadamon ke chalate bilders ke prati naram samajhi jane vaali rajya sarkaar is adhikari se naakhush thi
 Earlier, the Urban Development and Housing Department had suggested to the government that since the PMC is not discharging its responsibilities properly, the commissioner should be dissolved and the commissioner put on suspension
 haalanki aadhikarik rup se bhale hi koi rishta na ho lekin kuch rajnatik vishleshak yah aarope lagaate hai ki rajya ke shahari vikaas or awaasan vibhaag ke mantri samraat choudhary ko bhi narayan se purana hisaab chuktaa karnaa tha
 Although the emperor has categorically denied the reason behind Narayan's suspension, it is a fact that Narayan sold illegally on November 1, 2012 by leader Shakuni Chaudhary as Munger's Collector
 40 acre jameen ke nibataan ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Former minister Shakuni was allotted this land as an ex-serviceman
 narayan ke nilamban aadesh main mukhya bhoomika nibhaane vaale shahari vikaas or awaasan mantri samraat choudhary unheen shakuni choudhary ke bete hai
 The state government had earlier tried several ways to remove Narayan from the PMC
 sarkaar ne narayan ke tabadale par roak lagane vaale 2 july, 2013 ke patna hycourt ke aadesh ko khaarij karne ke liye pichley saal 25 november ko supreme court main vishesh anumati yachika daayar kii thi
 The Supreme Court, refusing to interfere in it, had directed the government to request the same court who had given instructions regarding the transfer
 july, 2014 main narayan ne anant singh kii patni neelam singh ke malikana haq vaale hotel buddha in ko avaidh qaraar dete hue uski bijli kaate jane kii sifarish kii
 Narayan issued the order when he came to know that the hotel was constructed by illegally transferring the lease in the name of JD (U) mla's wife
 hotel ko piemasi se kisi tarah ke panjikaran, enosi yaa building plan kii manjuuri ke bina hi bana liya gaya tha
 Then it was against the rules to use any property leased for residential purpose to build a commercial enterprise like a hotel
 narayan ne patna main anant singh kii ek anya sampatti patna central mal kii bhi do manjilon ko giraane kaa aadesh diya tha
 He also started an investigation into vigilance against 450 builders and landowners on charges of constructing tall buildings in violation of building regulations
 june-july, 2013 main piemasi ayukta ke taur par narayan ne 1,241 imaaraton ko notice jari kiya or 449 imaaraton ke nirmaan par pabandi lagava di, jinka nirmaan building upaniyamon kaa ulanghan karke kiye jane kaa andeh tha
 In September 2013, he filed vigilance cases against 70 buildings
 ve ab tak 472 nirmaanadhin imaaraton ke khilaaf karrwai shuru kar chuke hai
 The PMC Commissioner's Court has already issued orders in 150 such cases
 builder lobby aksar yah aarope lagaati rahi he ki narayan ke chalate pichley do saal main 15,000-20,000 karod ru
 Projects are hanging on
 bihar bijepi vidhayak dal ke netaa susheel kumaar modi ne narayan ke nilamban ke liye ek varisht jedy (you) netaa ko jimmedaar tehraaya he
 Before the government's suspension order, the city's mayor Afzal Imam also tried unsuccessfully to stop Narayan's salary
 piemasi ke parshadon ne unhen hataane ke liye hycourt main yachika daayar kii thi or mantri samraat choudhary ne unke par kutarne ke liye piemasi main dophaad karne kii koshish kii thi
 Narayan, however, continued his campaign against the powerful builder lobby, regardless
 patna hycourt kii ore se nilamban par roak lagaae jane ke baad narayan ne phir se apana kaam sambhaal liya he
 But the case took a new turn on 17 December when Acting Chief Justice Iqbal Ahmed Ansari directed the full bench of the High Court to hear it
 unka nirdesh sarkaar ke vakil ke anurodh par aayaa he
 On December 15, after the High Court stayed the suspension of Narayan, the government's counsel and Principal Additional Advocate General Lalit Kishore put the matter before the Acting Chief Justice for proper directions
 jabaki usee din kaaryvahak mukhya nyaayadhish justise ikbaal ahamed ansaari or justise samrendra pratap singh kii bench ne nilamban ke mudde par kuch kehane se khud ko paband kar liya
 However, Narayan is currently standing as the PMC Commissioner and apparently this is bad news for those who violate the building bye-laws

 Pitradosh is formed when there is a combination of Sun and Rahu in the second house, fifth house, ninth house, tenth house of the horoscope
 pitrudosh hone par vyakti kaa jivan kathinaaiyon se bharaa rahata he or koi bhi kaam time par nahin hota he
 It is very beneficial to see and worship the vampire Mukteshwar Mahadev in Ujjain to remove Pitridosh
 pishachmukteshwar mahadev kaa karen abhishek
 
 
 If any person has Pitradosh, then worship and consecrate Shri Vampire Mukteshwar Mahadev who comes at number 68 of 84 Mahadev in Ujjain
 isse sheeghra hi is dosha se mukti milti he
 Also, if the ancestors of the mother's clan, the ancestors of the father's clan are in the vagina, then they also get salvation
 in mahadev ke sparsh se saat kul pavitra hote hai
 Visiting them makes a person lord of opulence, record, mighty and immense wealth
 shraadh paksh ke 16 dinon main inkaa pujan va abhishek kar pitru moksh kii kaamana kerani chahie
 What is his story 
 
 kaliyug main soma naam kaa shudra hua karata tha jo dhanwaan hone ke saath hi naastik bhi tha
 He always condemned the Vedas
 soma bahut hi hinsak tha or isi swabhaav ke kaaran soma ko bahut hi kshtkaarak mrityu ko praapt hua
 Soma then received the vampire vagina
 nagn sharir or bhayaavah akruti vaala pishaach margon par khadey hokar logon ko maarane laga
 Once the Brahmins who knew Vedic knowledge and always spoke the truth were going somewhere, when that vampire ran to eat them
 brahman ko dekhakar pishaach ruuk gaya or sangyaheen ho gaya
 The vampire could not understand what was happening to him
 brahman ne pishaach se poocha tum mujhase ghabara kyon rahe ho
 The vampire said you are a Brahmin demon, so i am afraid of you
 yah sab sunakarbrahman hansane lageor pishaach ko uski is yoni se mukt hone kaa maarg bataaya
 The Brahmin said that among all the pilgrimages, the best pilgrimage is Avantika Tirtha, which remains intact in the Holocaust and there is Mahadev, the destroyer of vampires
 brahman ke vachanon ko sunakar vah jaldi se vahaan se mahakaal van kii ore chal diya
 There, after bathing with the water of Kshipra, he saw the vampire Mukteshwar
 darshan maatr se pishaach divya dev ko praapt ho gaya
 It is believed that whoever worships Mukteshwar Mahadev, does not disseminate wealth and sons and attains supreme bliss in the end by consuming all the pleasures in the world

 maharashtra main sambhavit gathbandhan kii taraf bad rahe ensipi or shivasena jaise pramukh dal somvaar se shuru hone vaale sheetakaaleen satr se pehle sansad main mahatvapurn baithkon se gaayab rahe
 Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi made it clear that the Shiv Sena will not be part of the NDA in the session
 joshi ne kaha, 've (shivasena) congress ke saath kaam karne kii koshish kar rahe hai, isliye swaabhaavik rup se, unhone vipaksh main baithne kaa vikalp chunaa he
 The government prepared the discussion
 However, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary told that in the all-party meeting, the opposition demanded that during the session, issues of economic slowdown, unemployment and agricultural crisis should be discussed
 sansadeey kaary mantri prahlaad joshi ne bataaya ki baithak main pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki sansad kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaam charchaa or bahes karnaa he
 Members of 27 parties attended the meeting
 joshi ke anusaar, pradhanmantri modi ne kaha ki yah satr bhi pichley satr jitna hi faldaayi hona chahie

 dilli main chunaav kii tarikhon ke elaan ke baad se ye sawaal or bhi jor pakadaney laga tha ki akhir bijpi dilli main kiske sahare arvind kejariwal ko chunauti dene ja rahi he
 It was fine to contest elections under Modi's leadership, but the question remained that who will be the face of BJP? subah se hi bijepi main nae chehron ke shaamil hone kii khabaren chalane lageen or kuch hi ghanton main jaya pradaa or shazia ilmi jaise chehron ke bijepi main shaamil hone kii atakalein tej huin or thodi hi der main ye donon naam kahin peeche chute or kiran bedi kaa naam sabase aage ho gaya
 As soon as he reached the BJP office, leaders like Sambit Patra and Shrikant Sharma wait a little and things are not clear yet
 
 
 uske baad mobile par ek massej aayaa ki amit shah chaar baje press conference karenge
 This made it clear that Kiran Bedi is now going to enter the BJP
 teen baje tak 11 ashok road par gahamaa gahami bad gai
 Preparations started for the press conference
 4 bajane se kuch der pehle hi dilli bijepi adhyaksh satish upaadhyaay dikhaai die or kuch hi minuton main amit shah ke saath kiran bedi kii entry hui
 Along with this were Arun Jaitley, Prabhat Jha, Dr
 Harshvardhan, Vijay Goel
 sabase pehle amit shah ne kiran bedi kaa bijepi main swaagat kiya
 He said that Kiran Bedi's arrival will give strength
 lekin in sabake bich satish upaadhyaay kaa cheharaa dekhne laayak tha, sabase kone main baithe lagaataar neeche dekh rahe the or sahaj dikhne kii koshish kar rahe the, lekin satish upaadhyaay, jagadish mukhi, vijay goyal, prabhaat jha jaise kai netaaon ke liye ye faisalaa utana filgud to nahin hi he ye sab jaanate hai
 But Kiran Bedi had come to meet the Prime Minister and her entry is being done by powerful leaders like Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley, then the party leadership's gesture is clear if the voice of protest is buried within
 kiran bedi ne shuruyaat hi is baat se kii ki pradhanmantri modi kii prerana se hi vah raajnneeti main ai hai or unke faisale ke peeche bhi piem hi hai
 The message is clear that now the voices of protest against them will not be heard as last time they were heard amidst speculation about their involvement
 sahi myanon main bijepi ab dilli ke dangal main utari he
 BJP has played its trump card in the form of Kiran Bedi
 bijepi kii sabase badi chunauti arvind kejariwal hai or vah hameshaa eemaandaaree, saafe chhavi or bhrashtachar ke kilaaf ladaai kii baat karte rahe hai
 In such a situation, Kiran Bedi is honest and her image is impeccable, so now there is a competition of thorns
 rahi baat siem candidet kii to philhal bijepi ko yahi behatar lagata he ki is par suspence banaae rakhe or shaayad vahi sahi bhi he
 Namrata Jain, who secured 12th rank in UPSC Civil Services, hails from Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh
 naksaliyon kaa garh kahe jane vaale dantewada main pali-badi namrata ke liye UPSC kii taiyaari karnaa aasaan nahin tha, lekin apane buland hausale or mehnat ke balboote par unhone upiessi main 12veen rank hasil kar apane jile ke saath puure chhattisgarh kaa naam roshan kiya he
 Namrata Jain (UPSC Namrata Jain) had secured 99th rank in the 2016 Civil Services Examination
 unhen bhartiya police seva mili thi or vah sardaar vallabhbhai patel rashtriya police academy, hyderabad main prashikshan le rahi hai
 Namrata Jain says, "I always wanted to be a collector
 jab main 8veen kaksha main thi, tab ek mahila adhikari mere skool main ai thi
 Later i was told that she was the collector
 main unase bahut prabhavit hui
 It was only then that i decided that i wanted to become a collector
 '' unhone kaha ki kaaphi samay pehle naksaliyon dwaara kiye gaye visfotane unke shahar ke police stesan ko tabah kar diya tha
 This incident encouraged him to join the Civil Service (UPSC Civil Services) to serve the poor and bring development in the Maoist affected area
 namrata jainane kaha, "main jis jagah se aati hum, vah naksalwad se buree tarah prabhavit he
 People there lack basic facilities like education
 main apane rajya ke logon kii seva karnaa chaahati hum
 "namrata studied up to class 10 in Dantewada, after which she moved to Bhilai in Chhattisgarh where she earned a bachelor's degree in engineering
 bataa den ki namrata ke pita ek sthaneey vyavsaayee hai, maa ek gruhinee hai or unke bhai ek chartered acountint banane kii ichha rakhte hai
 (with PTI input) bhartiya captain mahendra singh dhoni senior khilaadiyon ko yaadgaar vidaai dene ke liye jane jate hai or ab dekhnaa hoga ki unhone rahul dravid ke liye kya yojana banaai he jo yahaan shuukravaar ko england ke khilaaf antim ekadivasiy match ke saath apane vanade karier kaa ant karenge
 In 2008, Dhoni gave a memorable farewell to former captains Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble
 kumble ke uttaradhikari chune gayi dhoni ne apane is captain ko unke antim test ke baad apane kandhe par uthaa liya tha
 He then ensured that India's most successful bowler remained on the podium to lift the trophy after winning the series 2–0
 nagpur main ganguli ke antim test ke dauraan unhone apane is purv captain ko austrailia ke khilaaf kuch der ke liye team kii kaman sanbhaalane kaa mauka diya tha
 Dravid has failed to play a memorable innings so far in his last ODI series and has scored only 13 from four matches
 75 kii ausat se 55 ran banaaye hai
 The veteran made 39 in 343 odis in his career
 06 kii ausat se 10820 ran banaaye hai
 Dravid is the second most successful batsman in Test cricket but his performance in odis is not bad either
 vah vanade main sarvaadhik ran banane waalon kii suchi main saatven sthaan par hai
 Star players like Brian Lara and Mahela Jayawardene are behind them in this list
 yah pehla or aakhri mauka hoga jab dravid wales kii rajdhani main bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karenge
 Dhoni has always done something in honor of senior cricketers who have retired from international cricket during his career
 bharat ke april main vishwa cap jeetne ke baad dhoni or unki team ne sachin tendulkar ko apane kandhe par uthaakar mumbai ke vankhede stadium main victory lap lagaaya tha
 But as far as Dravid is concerned, it is ironic that during the 2007 series against Australia, it was Dhoni who played a key role in getting him out of the ODI team
 dravid ne england ke khilaaf paanch maichon kii ekadivasiy shrinkhalaa ke liye bhartiya team main vaapasi karne ke turant baad hi ekadivasiy cricket se sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa kar di thi

 This will save tax evasion
 ye aarthik sudhaar kii disha main ek sahi kadam he
 Due to this, the tax that was being levied on the tax will now end
 upabhokta ab manthali ritern bhi aasaani se file kar sakate hai
 While there, he told the shopkeepers not to panic
 vah thode bahut changes kar hi is system ko lagu kar sakate hai

 marital rape ko lekar dilli hai court main daayar kii gai do nai yachikaaon par court ne centre sarkaar ko notice jari kiya he ki wo apana paksh saaf kare
 Section 375, 376B of the Indian Penal Code has been challenged in the original petitions
 kuch mahila sanghathanon or mahilaon ne us kanoon main badlaav kii maang kii he, jisamen pati ke jabaran shaareerik sambandh banane par patni rape kaa cese darj nahin kara sakati
 This is the argument of the pleader in favor of men, how can violence against women be allowed legally
 jabaki kuch enjio purushon ke paksh main bhi court main is maamle main samarthan karne ke liye khadey ho gaye hai
 They say that if changes are made in the law and rape cases are filed against the husband too, then the family can be broken
 haalanki court ne kaha ki bahut se shaadishuda log bhi repist hai, kya aapke paas koi aankada he ki kitne log aise hai jinhone shaadishuda hone ke baad bhi rape kiya he?kanoon main sanshodhan ke paksh main nahin he centreisase pehle puraani yachikaaon par sunwaayee ke dauraan marital rape ko aparaadh kii shrenee main rakhane kii maang sambandhi yachika par centre ne hai court ko kaha he kisarkaar dhara 375 main sanshodhan karne ke paksh main nahinhai
 The Center has said that the Law Commission is also not in its favor
 dilli hai court main apane die gaye halafname main centre sarkaar ne kaha he ki lau kamishan kii 84veen report se saaf he ki agar koi pati apni 15 saal se kam umr kii patni ke saath sex karata he to hi use marital rape kii category main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Center to clear its stand, the High Court, while hearing two new petitions filed on Tuesday with the Marital Repco, has asked the government to clear its stand, in which the petitioner alleged that in section 375 (rape) of IPC The amendment made in 2013 is incorrect and does not match Section 377 (unnatural relations) of the Indian Penal Code
 IPC kii dhara 375 main ek apvaadyachika main yah aarope lagaate hue ek kanoonee mudda uthaaya gaya he ki IPC ke donon dand praavdhaanon main anischitata he kyonki IPC kii dhara 375 main ek apwaad he ki kisi purush dwaara apni patni, jisaki umr 15 saal se kam naa ho, ke saath yon sambandh yaa yon gatividhiyaan balaatkaar nahin he
 To end the legal uncertainty, the petitioner has said in the petition that the court should eliminate the legal uncertainty, which is violating the respective rights of husband and wife
 yachikakarta apni patni kii shikaayat par aprakritik sex ke kathith aparaadh ke liye mukademe kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 The man married a 20-year-old girl in 2013, who later filed a case against him for the alleged crime of rape and unnatural sex
 28 agast ko hogi agali sunwaayeenichali adaalat ne use patni sabalaatkaar kearope se mukt kar diya tha, lekin aprakritik sex ke aarope main mukadmaa jari rakhaa tha
 The person was granted bail by the High Court in January 2015
 haalanki supreme court main is umr ko 15 se badhaakar 18 saal karne ko lekar lagaai gayi yachika par sunwaayee chal rahi he
 The court will next hear the matter on August 28

 Political arrogance is growing in the picture of Mohammad Ali Jinnah in Aligarh Muslim University
 pehle bijepi saansad satish gautam ne tasviir lagane par vishvavidhyalay prashasan se safai maangi thi
 Now BJP MLA and minister in UP government, Swami Prasad Maurya has justified the putting a picture praising Jinnah
 swami prasad maury ne kaha ki raashtra nirmaan main jin mahapurushon kaa yogadan rahaa he unpar anguli uthaanaa ghatiya baat he
 He said that Jinnah also contributed to this country before the partition of the country
 maury ne aisa bayaan dekar ab apni party ke netaa ko katghare main khadaa kar diya he
 Apart from Satish Gautam, many other BJP leaders have also supported the removal of Jinnah's photo
 bijepi saansad mahesh giri ne bhi twit kar AMU kii kaaryastylee par hi sawaal khadey kar die hai
 BJP supporters are also running a social media campaign on Twitter in the name of # jinnahfreeamu

 University spokesperson Shafe Kidwai defended the picture of Jinnah hanging for decades, saying that Jinnah was a founding member of the university and was given a lifetime membership of the students' union
 pravaktaa ne kaha, ‘jinna ko bhi 1938 main aligarh muslim vishvavidhyalay chaatrasangh kiaaajivan sadsyta di gaithi
 He was also a founding member of the University Court in 1920 and a donor
 ’unhone kaha ki jinna ko muslim lig dwaara pakistan kii maang kiye jane se pehle sadsyta di gai thi
 The university spokesperson said that even after independence, no national leader has objected to the related picture
 inamen mahatma gandhi, moulana aaazaad, sarvapalli radhakrishnan, si rajagopalaachari, rajend prasad or jawahar laal nehru shaamil hai
 He said that Aligarh Muslim University Students' Union has a long tradition of giving lifetime membership to famous personalities in political, social and educational fields
