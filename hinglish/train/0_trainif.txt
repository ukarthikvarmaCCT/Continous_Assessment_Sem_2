 Amla has scored two centuries so far and both times his team had to face defeat
 yani ipel main aise pehle ballebaaj bane gaye, jiske shatakon ke baavjood unki team haar gai
 (that too not once, twice) In the history of IPL, apart from Amla, it has happened seven times when the team of the batsman who scored a century has lost
 lekin amala ekmaatr ballebaaj hai, jinaki centuri se do baar team haari

 ’pradesh kii congress sarkaar ko traasadee ke samay vifaltaa kaa sabase kharaab udhaaharan bataate hue modi ne kaha ki centre kii sarkaar ko bhi is naakaami kii jimmedaari leni hogi
 He criticized the central government, saying that despite the promise, the Congress employed only one crore youth in its ten-year tenure, while the NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee had only six in the tenure of six years

 The preparations of the police have also come into question after the incident of the death of four policemen in an attack by Naxalites in Latehar's canopy on Friday night before the election
 haalanki police ke adhikariyon kaa kahana he ki shantipurna chunaav ke liye puri taiyaari he
 It is believed that as part of the strategy to conduct peaceful elections, the voting schedule for 81 assembly seats in Jharkhand has been kept in five phases
 vidhansabha chunaav main is chunauti se nipatane ke liye police or chunaav ayog puri tarah jute najar aa rahe hai
 Influence of Naxalite Organization in Districts It is generally believed that in most of the districts of Jharkhand, there is more or less the influence of some Naxalite organization
 pehle charan main 30 november ko jin chah jilon ke 13 vidhansabha kshetron main matdaan hona he, ve sarvaadhik naksal prabhavit hai
 In such a situation, the first phase election for security forces is considered to be the most challenging in terms of security
 pratham charan main latehar, chatra, gadwa, lohardaga, gumla or palamu jilon main matdaan hona he
 According to the news agency IANS, it is not that the police administration and the Election Commission are not conscious about the Naxalites

 The Central Election Commission team has also visited Jharkhand and reviewed all the preparations regarding security arrangements
 chunaav karaane or vibhinn kshetron main matadaataaon main vishwaas jagaane ko lekar alag-alag suraksha bal muhaiyaa bhi karaae gaye hai
 Preparations for election in Naxal-affected areas, an official of the entire state police headquarters says that all preparations have been completed at the administrative level to conduct elections in Naxal-affected areas
 unhone kaha ki maahaul bigadane kii aanshaka vaale kshetron main abhi se hi karrwai prarambh kar di gai he
 The Election Commission has also accepted that the decision to conduct voting in five phases for only 81 assembly seats in Jharkhand has been taken from security point of view
 mana jaataa he ki ayog kii soch sabhi ilaakon main suraksha agenciyon kii vyapak tainaati ko lekar ho sakati he
 Besides the Communist Party of India (maoist), a banned Naxalite organization in Jharkhand, several Naxalite armed forces have been formed, who have been declaring the election boycott

 In the world of social media, the Congress party seems to be constantly lagging behind the BJP, on which the Congress is now preparing to revamp its strategy
 congress party kaa soshal media par parfarmens kaa alam ye he ki congress kii aadhakarik website INC India or rahul gandhi ke twitor acount trend nahin kar pate he or deependra hooda, bhupendra hooda kaa janmdin trend kar jaataa he yaa phir unka koi bhaashan
 This is the reason why the quarrel over IT cell in Congress is going on continuously, when the Hooda government was in Haryana, when Dipendra Hooda was made the head of the IT cell of Congress, after which Rahul Pandey was appointed as the head of IT cell
 Went
 lekin haryana vidhansabha chunaav main congrek kii haar ke baad hooda ne iti cell kaa kharchaa pani dena bhi band kar diya tha
 After which the expenses of IT cell started to be paid by the treasurer of Congress party Motilal Vora
 lekin sawaal khadaa rahaa ki iti team kaa dedication kya sirf hooda parivaar ke saath he ? jisko lekar vivaad badhata rahaa, jiske kaaran iti pramukh rahul pandey 10-12 baar istife kii peshkash kar chuke hai
 After meeting PK and Rahul Gandhi, Rahul Pandey offered to resign once again after an argument with Rahul Gandhi and Congress strategist Prashant Kishore
 prashanth kishor or rahul pandey ke bich bahes isi baat par hui kii congress kii nitiyaan, rahul kaa berthde or rahul par hamalaa karne waalon ke khilaaf congress ke tikat army kyon bikhar jaati he, lekin jab mauka rahul pandey ke mukhiya deependra hooda ke janmdin or deependra ke pita bhupendra hooda se jude kisi masale kaa aata he tab congress ke soshal media kii yah army majbootee se kyon najar aati he sawaal yahi he congress rahul gandhi or uske palatwaar jab soshal media main trend nahin kar pate
 What is the need of such a department, the bigger question than this is that when this department can make an individual case trend, then why the Congress party and media department lags behind on the given issues
 rahul pandeykul milakar ab congress party ke bich soshal media kii asafalataa kii jimmedaari fiks hogi jiske tahat ab nai team congress ke media prabhareerandeep surajevaalako jimmedaari saunpi jaaegi
 Efforts will be made to try new teams for Rahul Gandhi and the party instead of any individual
 10 se 12 baar istipha dene vaale or tamaam logon par thande garm dikhne vaale rahul pandey kaa istipha is baar sweekaar hota he yaa phir vaaki unako nikaal diya gaya he yaa istipha dene ke liye kaha gaya he, iske baad unki vaapasi pareshaani kaa sabab dikhti he
 In the Uttarakhand assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has given a clean sweep to the Congress

 piem modi ne kaha ki bhagwaan buddha kehete the ki kisi ke dukh ko dekhakar dukhi hone se zyada behatar he ki us vyakti ko uske dukh ko dur karne ke liye taiyaar karo,use shashakt karo
 He said that we are happy that our government is following the path of compassion and service which was shown to us by Lord Buddha

 is panchayat ne 1000 karod turnover kii ek kapadaa company ko apni panchayat main permanent license nahin diya
 The panchayat says that the company's plant produces pollution, the company says that the State Pollution Board has given a No Objection Certificate
 maamla adaalat main he lekin 8000 karmchaariyon vaali yah company panchayat main utar gai he
 In the Panchayat elections to be held this year, it is going to take off its candidates for all the 17 wards
 iske liye company ne gaanv ke logon ke bich do saal main 28 karod rupee kharch diye jabaki panchayat chaar saal main 22 karod hi kharch pai
 Helped from students to patients and made roads better by setting up drinking water plants
 panchayat ke 77 fisadi sadsy company kii suvidha lene ke liye registerd ho chuke hai or vam dalon ke kaaryakarta bhi company kaa baij lagaakar gum rahe hai
 We are seeing or not seeing the dangers of corporate involvement in political parties, but if such infiltration takes place at the level of the gram sabha, then the land acquisition will be done according to the company

 Damodami Mintal, a religious organization of Sikhs, has announced the rail roko movement to give clean chit to Tytler by CBI
 damdami taksaalake is andolan kaa asar jalandhar sahit punjab ke duusare ilaakon main bhi dekhne ko mil rahaa he
 Yesterday, during a press conference by the Home Minister in the Congress office in Delhi, Tytler got involved with a Sikh journalist Jarnail Singh on the issue of a clean chit by the CBI
 jaranel singh ke baar baar sawaal puche jane ko lekar chidambaram kuch jhalla gaye
 He said no argument, after which journalist Jarnail Singh got angry and picked up the shoe and threw it towards the Home Minister
 sab hairaan the lekin chidambaram shant baithe rahe, jaise kuch hua hi naa ho
 You know why, because the Congress understands that giving more attention to this issue at this time can remove its air
 isiilie to congress ne jaraa der nahin lagaai, kah diya ki unhen jaranel singh ke khilaaf koi karrwai nahin kerani
 At the same time the party tried to suppress the matter, but it could not happen
 84 dangon ke masale par chidambaram par juuta phenk kar jo jhatka us sikh patrkaar ne congress ko diya, usne sikh sanghathanon ke bich us patrkaar ko hero bana diya he
 Sikh organizations took to the streets in favor of Jarnail Singh
 chandigarh se lekar dilli tak, sikh sanghathan ek hi sur main bolne lage hai
 The incident has directly impacted till the Sikh pilgrimage city of Amritsar
 sikhon kii badi sanstha he damdami taksaal, usne to is mudde par aaj punjab main rail thapp karne kii taiyaari kar lee he
 She is no longer tired of praising Jarnail Singh
 yahi sab to congress nahin chaahati thi, bijepi or akali dal jaisi virdohi partiyon ke bayanon ko to janata shaayad siyaasi bayaan bhi maan leti, lekin sikh sanghathanon kaa chunaav se en pehle sadakon par is tarah utarana congress ke liye mushkilen khadi kar saktaa he
 BJP leaders are tight-lipped for modi-shah to reach out to meet mamtamodi-shah
 Watching as a victory
 bijepi netaaon ke bayanon se is baat ke sanket milte hai
 The statements are trying to show that Mamata Banerjee, who has fought the battle of political supremacy with the BJP, now has to come on the back foot
 bijepi ke rashtriya mahasachiv or pashchim bengal prabharee kailash vijayawargeey ne mamata kii mulaakaat kii tulana oont ke pahaad ke neeche aane se kar di
 He raised a question by tweeting something like, "now came the camel under the mountain !! Should West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister be taken in this sense? Whereas bjp's state in Madhya Pradesh Kailash Vijayvargiya also retweeted the tweet by Vice President Jeetu Jirati
 jisamen jitu ne mamata banerjee ke puraane bayanon kaa zikr kar tanj ksaa he
 Jitu wrote in tweeting- i do not consider Narendra Modi as Prime Minister, i will feed Modi with pebble rasgullas in Bengal
 bengal main helicopter nahi utaarne duungi
 Referring to these old statements of Mamta, Jeetu finally wrote - Didi take flowers with whom she has gone to meet
 
 
 
 Now came

 pashchim bengal main pair pasaarne main teji se juty bijepi se kai muddon ko lekar mamata banerjee kii bhidat ho chuki he
 She has been using strong language against PM Modi and Amit Shah on several occasions
 isse pehle piem modi kii baithkon kaa bhi bahishkaar kar chuki he
 For example, Mamta Banerjee did not attend the all-party meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of 'one country - one election'
 isi tarah, sharada chitfund ghotaale main pichley varsh jab sibiai rajeev kumaar se poochtacha karne pahunchi thi to kolkata police ne team ko hi hiraasat main le liya tha
 She sat on a dharna against the CBI raid
 rajya main bina anumati ke chhapemari ke liye sibiai ke ghusane par bhi roak he
 Mamta's party has been at loggerheads with TMC and BJP over the death of more than 80 activists in political rivalry in West Bengal
 itani takaraav mol lene or ab tak bhent se parhez karne vaaleen mamata banerjee ke ab piem modi or amit shah se milane ke liye dilli pahunchane ko bijepi apni jeet ke rup main dekh rahi he
 This is the reason BJP leaders are describing this meeting as coming on the backfoot

 The Delhi government has made a big announcement for the helpers of those injured in road accidents in Delhi
 sadak par haadase kaa shikaar logon ko agar koi bina der kiye aspataal pahunchaata he, to unhen dilli sarkaar ab do hajaar rupee kaa nakad inaam degi
 The Delhi cabinet has given its approval to this decision and this decision will be implemented soon
 aksar yah dekha gaya he ki sadak durghatana main ghayal vyakti kii madad karne se log is liye kataraate hai ki kahin vah kisi kanoonee pachade main na funs jaaen
 Due to this fear, many times the injured are unable to get help in time and this delay proves fatal for them
 is bare main lambey vakt se maang uthati rahi he ki aise madadgaaron ko kanoonee suraksha di jaae, taaki unke man main bevajaah ke kanoonee jhamelon funsane kaa dar nikaala ja sake
 The Central Government has also enacted a Good Samartian law for this and the Supreme Court has also instructed the hospitals, including the police, that those who bring the injured to the hospital should not be questioned and should not be involved in any legal action
 balki ghayal ko aspataal pahunchane par sabase pehle unka ilaaj kiya jaae, taaki uski jaan bachaai ja sake
 Also, there is no question from the person who sent the injured to the hospital and if necessary, at least paperwork should be done
 dilli sarkaar ne bhi is disha main ek kadam or badhaate hue madadgaaron ko puruskrit karne kaa faisla kiya he, taaki na sirf unke man se khauf nikle, balki unke man main ye bhaavana bhi aae ki unke kaam ko saraahaa gaya he
 According to Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, the government wants the injured to remain unattended on the road and people should be encouraged to help the injured

 Narendra Modi or Nitish Kumar, who will become Prime Minister? The leaders of the BJP and its associated organizations are making some such statement every day, due to which this question is coming up again and again
 sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ne bihar kii tarif kar ek or shigupha chhod diya he
 However, now Mohan Bhagwat himself is denying this and BJP is also giving clarification
 kya nitish kumaar narendra modi se behatar netaa hai
 Before the general elections to be held in 2014, this question is once again coming up strongly and this question has arisen due to a statement by Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke sarasanghachaalak mohan bhagwat ne kaha he ki bihar vikaas ke maamle main gujarat se bhi acha kaam kar rahaa he
 In a conversation with foreign media on Friday, Bhagwat told Bihar ahead of Gujarat in terms of good governance
 mohan bhagwat ne kaha he ki kabhi gujarat ko log vikaas kaa model maanate the, lekin nitish ke shashan vaale bihar ne use chunauti di he
 While praising Bihar, Bhagwat said that while all the possibilities of development were exhausted, Nitish has presented a new model of development by doing excellent work
 jaahir he mohan bhagwat ke is bayaan ke raajnneetik matlab nikaale ja rahe hai
 Especially when the NDA is in a ruckus about the prime ministerial candidate
 haalanki sangh ne bina der kiye mohan bhagwat ke bayaan par safai pesh kar di he
 Apparently BJP is also saying that Mohan Bhagwat's statement is being misinterpreted
 arun jetali ne apni party kaa bachaav kiya he
 By the way, after the statement of Mohan Bhagwat, at least in the whirlwind, JDU is feeling laddoo in both of its hands
 party ke netaa yah kehete nahin agha rahe hai ki unhen nitish or bihar ke liye certificate kii jarurat nahin he
 Just a few days ago, BJP leader LK Advani had commented on the Prime Ministerial candidature in his blog, which said that non-bjp candidates
 yani pehle adwani or ab mohan bhagwat
 Those who say this may say that this is not the defense of Nitish Kumar

 European technology regulators have financed $ 5 billion on American technology company Google
 ise bhartiya mudra main tabdeel karenge to yah lagbhag 30 hajaar karod rupee hota he
 The European Commission says that Google has misused market access of its Android operating system
 iske alaava ye bhi kaha gaya he ki google ne kathith taur par smartphone banane vaali companiyon ko android forcd varjan par chalane vaale divaais banane nahin diya he
 Forked version means open source Android which companies used to customize in their own way
 itnaa hi nahin, kaha gaya he ki google ne badi companiyon or mobile networks ko apane handsets main google search ap dene ke liye paise bhi die hai
 Google's parent company Alphabet has been given 90 days to change its business practice
 kaha gaya he ki agar aisa karne main company fail hoti he to rojaanaa ke turnover kaa 5 fisadi hissaa jurmaana ke taur par vasuul kiya jayega
 Significantly, this penalty imposed on Google is the highest ever imposed on any one company
 bibisi kii ek report ke mutabik google ke siio sundar pichaai ko is faisle ke bare main compatishan kamishan margret vestager pehle se hi bataaya he
 Why was the penalty imposed? The reason behind this fine on Google is quite simple and if you use Android then you will be familiar with it
 aapako bataa den ki android smartfones main google ke eps pehle se hi instold hote hai or duusari eps companiyaan ye iljaam lagaati ai hai ki aise main yugers ko google ke hi ap yuj karnaa padataa he, kyonki wo pehle se smartphone main hota he
 By doing this, Google not only uses the app, but through it, it also sets its target ad
 european union kii compatishan chif marget vestager ne kaha he, ‘google ne android ko apane search ingine kii pahunch badhaane ke liye whical ke taur par istemaal kiya he
 By doing this, Google has done the job of innovating its competitors and preventing them from competing on merit 'the European Commission had been investigating Android since last year and the reason for this is said to be the complaint of Google's competitors
 google ke pratidwandiyon kaa aarope he ki google apane software kii pahunch kaa galat istemaal kar rahaa he
 According to a report in The Verge, in 2013, fairsearch filed a complaint against Google and the group included companies such as Nokia, Microsoft and Oracle
 microsoft ke tatkaalik siio steve balmar ne bhi kaha tha ki google ko monopoli kii tarah he or is par lagaam lagani chahie

 yah maamla nae daur banaam parampara kaa he
 Both the presidential candidates, Pranab Mukherjee and P
K
 e
 Sangma has started his campaign for Raisina Hill in his special style
 sangama kaa chunaav abhiyaan haai-tech he or usamen ek website, chamakdaar broshar, khabaron se bharin press conference or yahaan tak ki unki dhol bajaati jhlakiyaan bhi hai, jisamen madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan unki dhun par naach rahe hai
 In contrast, Mukherjee is visiting every state for support and dignity is the foundation of his election campaign
 iske alaava, purv vitt mantri or purv loksabhaa adhyaksh, donon prayek saansad or vidhayak se samarthan kii apil karte hue unhen patr bhej chuke hai
 Mukherjee's letter — in his characteristic style — talks about the historical significance of the presidency
 unhone likhaa he, ''is pad par us mahaan peedi ke sarvshereshth log asin hue the, jis peedi main swatantra aadhunik bharat ke sansthaapak shaamil the
 "he also cites his political legacy," i have learned the story of politics in Mrs Gandhi's pro-poor commitment
 '' lekin isi main ek chipa hua sandesh bhi he jo ho saktaa he, congress ko unki pehali chetavanee ho
 That is, "the President is above party politics
 mauka diya gaya, to meraa prayaas is pad ke mulyon kii raksha karnaa hogaah eemaandaaree, nishpakshta or sarv dharm sambhaav ko badhaava dena
 "even before he is elected President, Mukherjee has made it clear that he is not going to become a rubber stamp
" iske vipareet, sangama kii apil zyada chamakdaar he
 He has sent a brochure with his appeal, listing his achievements
 unki website main ek aakarshak tag line he-gaaro hills se raisina hill tak
 Sangma is revealing his tribal identity, stating that he is a Garo tribal of Meghalaya who believes in Christianity
 ve yah bhi jataate hai ki kis tarah unhone loksabhaa adhyaksh rahete hue naitikta ke liye ek sansadeey samiti kaa gathan karavaaya tha or is naate kaise ve raashtrapati pad ke liye sabase upyukt hai
 In the words of a member of Team Sangma, "the vote given to Sangma will be the vote for social justice
" '' is website se us website kii yaad taaja ho jaati he jo 2009 main bijepi kii ore se pradhanmantri pad ke daavedaar laalkrishna adwani ne banavaai thi
 Considering the fact that his daughter Agatha is still a minister in the UPA government, Sangma takes care not to work from Agatha's house
 unhone dilli ke vitthalbhai patel house main ek cameraa le liya he or press conference bijepi netaa or loksabhaa sadsy ech
 N
 anant kumaar ke ghar ke lon main yojit kii jaati he
 Sangma's 'dirty Tricks' department is being handled by Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy, who is accusing him daily of trying to disqualify Mukherjee from the race
 swami-sangama kii jodi ne pehle aarope lagaaya tha ki bhartiya sankhyikee santhaan ke adhyaksh ke rup main ve laabh ke pad par virajman hai
 When Mukherjee issued his resignation letter dated 20 June from his post, he claimed that the signature on the letter was forged
 phir swami ne kaha ki mukherjee laabh ke do anya padon-birbhum institute of ejineering and technology ke upaadhyaksh or rabindra bharti sosayadi ke adhyaksh pad par kabiz hai
 Both institutions have clarified that Mukherjee resigned as vice-president and president respectively, long before he signed his nomination for the presidency
 sangama ko bijepi, eiediemke or bijedy jaise duusare dalon kaa samarthan praapt he
 Mukherjee is an authorized UPA candidate and also has support from NDA allies like JD (U) and Shiv Sena
 mukherjee apana chunaav abhiyaan kaaphi had tak khud hi sambhaal rahe hai or sansadeey kaary mantri pawan kumaar bansal unke aane-jane kii vyavastha dekh rahe hai
 Mukherjee's victory is believed to be decided, the only thing worth seeing will be the difference in votes

 Although there does not seem to be any party getting a majority, but the BJP seems to be in a situation where it will play an effective role in the state
 si voter kaa chunavisarvekahata he ki jammu kashmir membijepico 27 se 33 siten mil sakati hai
 The PDP is projected to get the maximum 38 seats, which is just 5 seats more than the BJP
 haalanki vahaan kisi bhi party ko bahumat miltaa nahin dikh rahaa lekin bijepi ke khate main jaati dikh rahi 33 siten uske liye bahut badi jeet he
 For BJP, winning 27 to 33 seats in Jammu and Kashmir is equivalent to victory
 kyonki jammu ke kuch hisson ko chhodkar party vahaan kabhi thi hi nahin
 As per the hung assembly in Jammu and Kashmir, whose government will be formed in Jammu and Kashmir? Will Omar Abdullah support BJP? Although he has announced to walk alone, nothing is sure in politics

 When Omar Abdullah tweeted and said that Bharat Ratna was given to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, there was a discussion that bjp's political ambition is going to happen in Jammu and Kashmir but he immediately said that he will not support any party
 idhar, mahabuuba mufti dilli main jami hui hai
 His party is also seen getting the maximum number of seats, so whether the Congress can support the PDP once again, there is a possibility that the PDP can extend its hand to the Congress to keep the BJP out of power

 Everything will be determined by what the public message comes on Tuesday morning

 They say that after working so much, if the proposal to increase the salary to 500, 1000 is a joke with them

 The banker says that the losses of banks have not increased due to their mistake

 We found out how much a clerk and a manager, who has worked for five years, gets in his hands, so that you as an audience can know why the condition of the bank which was considered a good job is today
 paanch saal anubhav vaale clerk ko kareeb 27000 miltaa he
 At the same time, an officer with five years of experience gets 32-34000
 kya yah kam nahin he jabaki ve kaam kitna karte hai
 All government banks are going through a historical deficit
 unki haalat lagaataar bighad rahi he
 There are different reasons for this, but the effect of all this is that in 2017-19, the loss of banks is now starting to be several thousand crores
 ham kuch bainkon kaa ghaataa bataane ja rahe hai
 Losses of Punjab National Bank - 12, 282 crores, idbi's losses 8,237 crores, sbi's losses 6547 crores, Bank of India's losses 6043 crores, Oriental Bank of Commerce's losses 5871 crores, Union Bank of India's losses are 5247 crores

 aaj ke bijness standard main ek report he ki jo laghu vitt bank kaa enpie bhi 5-6 pratishat ho gaya he, jo notebandi ke pehle ke saal main 1 pratishat tha
 NPA means loan but could not repay
 bijness standard ne hi chapa he ki 2017-18 kii chauthi timahi main 37 bainkon ke enpie main 1 lakh 40 hazaar karod or jud gaye hai
 Is the common banker responsible for this as well
 dharna banane ke pehle tathyon ko thik se dekh lenaa chahie
 Therefore, bankers have included in their demand letter that often staff are forced to work late, their time is recorded
 maukhik aadesh se kaam band ho, kaam ke samay main badlaav kaa aadesh likhit aae
 No staff should be forced to work more than seven consecutive days
 aath ghante se zyada ve kaam na karen, saptaah main 40 ghante hi kaam karne ko kaha jaae
 All Saturdays are a holiday that is rarely met now
 zaahir he bankeron ko isse zyada karnaa padataa he
 Then these things have been mentioned in their demand letter
 ek maang yah bhi he ki dhamkaane or dabaav daalane ke liye tabadale kaa istamaal band kar diya janaa chahie
 Looking at the demand letter, it seems that the bankers want salary but there is a serious decline in working conditions
 isamen pension kii bhi maang he jiske bare main ab koi baat nahin karnaa chahta
 Legislative mps themselves take pension but make policies to ensure that others do not get pension

 jab das lakh banker par koi charchaa nahin he to paune do lakh vaale ko bhi samajhnaa chahie ki media ke loktantr main asli log nahin aate hai
 These postal servants should also ask what they were seeing in newspapers and channels before the strike, what they were reading, whether they have seen the voice of the common people, except for the exception, how their voice would appear when not seen
 gramin daksevakon ne sab karke dekh liya
 Sold the vegetables, took off clothes, there were various problems, but his heart was broken

 How many important papers of people must not be reaching
 magar gramin dak sevakon kii sun to lijie taaki unhen ye na lage ki koi sunne vaahsaab se selary deni chahie
 While working for 35 years, these postal service packers get only 7-8000 salary
 agar aisa he to kya yah dukhad nahin he
 After 35 years of job, 7000 is not LA
 inkaa kahana he ki chaar saal paanch saal kaam karne ke baad haath main chah hazaar miltaa he, isse inkaa guzaaraa nahin chal rahaa he
 The government should also pay them the salary of the Seventh Pay Commission
 inhen pension tak nahin milti he
 The Kamlesh Chanda Committee was formed at the time of the Modi government, it also talked about increasing salary, but it is not being increased
 lihaaza desh ke alag-alag jagahon par gramin dak sevak hadtaal par hai

 We spoke to the rural post servant of Muzaffpur

 shaayad yahi wo bharat he jo 99 pratishat aata he jiske paas kuch nahin he
 1 percent of Indians have as much property as 70 percent of Indians have
 tippaniyan It is not that the people do not struggle, they are doing but what is happening
 koi nateeja nikal rahaa he, shaayad nahin
 There have been many videos of Gramin Dak Sevaks
 in video main ek trend dekh rahaa hum
 a video of Surat's textile traders also came when they were agitating
 us video main ve geet ga rahe hai, anunay vinay kar rahe hai jaise koi apni premika se karata ho, un gaanon main aakrosh nahin he, zindaabad murdaabaad nahin he, usee tarah kaa ek video mila he, aap dekhie or samajhie ki gramin dak sevak kya kahana chaahate hai
 We spoke to the rural post servant of Muzaffpur
 unhone bataaya ki ve britash jamaane se gaanvon main dak le ja rahe hai
 Work under Postal Department but the Department does not consider them as their employees
 in logon ne apni ladaai supreme court or cat se jeet lee he magar abhi tak inhen karmchaaree ke rup main manyata nahin mili he
 Whereas they distribute cycles by cycling in every village
 is bich 16 dinon tak lagaataar petrol ke daam badhane ke baad aaj kamaal hi ho gaya
 1 paise became cheaper, while in the international market, the price of crude oil has come down by four and a half dollars
 1 paise kii kami ko kam na samajhen
 After the break we will see an important report on Mandsaur and cancer
 bank series ke dauraan anek bankeron ne patr likhakar bataaya ki unka mul kaam badla ja rahaa he
 The house is not allowed to go until a certain number of insurance is sold and has to work on Saturday Sundays as well
 2016 main jab in bankeron par notebandi kaa faisla thopa gaya to us chunauti ko sweekaar kiya or din raat lagaakar kaam kiya
 You know that during this time, crores of notes came in the banks, due to which there was a mistake in counting
 sade gale note aa gaye or nakli note bhi chale aae
 Cashiers receiving 20,000 salary have made it from their pocket from Rs 5000 to Rs 2 lakh
 kai kaitiyaron ne hamen likhaa he ki unhen apni jeb se 2 xxrep 4 0 dena padaa to kisi ko 48000 dena padaa
 Obviously, where you count 60-70 lakh notes of the day, if you start counting 5 crore 10 crore, then there will be a lapse
 kai bainkon main note ginaney kii mashin tak nahin thi us vakt
 We do not have complete information about how much cash all the cashiers together have given as a penalty out of their pocket at the time of demonetisation
 ye sab kahani banker chipa gaye, kyonki inhen laga tha ki inke tyaag se sarkaar khush hogi or selary badha degi kyonki inaki selary kaaphi hoti ja rahi he
 They claim so
 bank series ke dauraan hamen kai mahila bankeron ne likhaa tha ki unki shakha main mahila shauchalay tak nahin he
 In many places there is only one toilet for both men and women
 mahila bankeron kaa kahana he ki sirf chah maheene kaa maatrutiv avkaash miltaa he, jabaki kend sarkaar kii naukariyon main do saal kaa child care live miltaa he
 If they take leave without salary, then those holidays are not easily available
 uski prakriya kaaphi jatil he
 In Delhi, Sushil Mahapatra has spoken at length to many women bankers on these questions
 kya yahi banker bainkon kii sthiti ke liye zimmedaar hai
 The salary which was to be increased in 2012 increased towards the end of 2015
 2017 main jise badhani chahie thi wo abhi tak nahin badi he
 During this, the endurance of the bankers is responding because they are not spending
 iskaa ek hi upaay he, har bank main godi media kaa hindu muslim silebus or propeganda roj subah ek ghanta dikhaaya jaae
 i believe that these people will start working for free
 vaise prime time par kai hafte series chalaane se bhi bankeron ko koi laabh nahin hua
 We found out how much a clerk and a manager, who has worked for five years, gets in his hands, so that you as an audience can know why the condition of the bank which was considered a good job is today
 paanch saal anubhav vaale clerk ko kareeb 27000 miltaa he
 At the same time, an officer with five years of experience gets 32-34000
 kya yah kam nahin he jabaki ve kaam kitna karte hai
 All government banks are going through a historical deficit
 unki haalat lagaataar bighad rahi he
 There are different reasons for this, but the effect of all this is that in 2017-19, the loss of banks is now starting to be several thousand crores
 ham kuch bainkon kaa ghaataa bataane ja rahe hai
 Losses of Punjab National Bank - 12, 282 crores, idbi's losses 8,237 crores, sbi's losses 6547 crores, Bank of India's losses 6043 crores, Oriental Bank of Commerce's losses 5871 crores, Union Bank of India's losses are 5247 crores
 ek sawaal khud se kiijie kya har bank main itane nithlle or nakaare banker baithe hai ki unheen kii vajah se kareeb 80,000 karod tak kaa ghaataa ho gaya yaa koi or jimmedaar hoga iske liye
 Such as government, management, industrialists
 aaj ke bijness standard main ek report he ki jo laghu vitt bank kaa enpie bhi 5-6 pratishat ho gaya he, jo notebandi ke pehle ke saal main 1 pratishat tha
 NPA means loan but could not repay
 bijness standard ne hi chapa he ki 2017-18 kii chauthi timahi main 37 bainkon ke enpie main 1 lakh 40 hazaar karod or jud gaye hai
 Is the common banker responsible for this as well
 dharna banane ke pehle tathyon ko thik se dekh lenaa chahie
 Therefore, bankers have included in their demand letter that often staff are forced to work late, their time is recorded
 maukhik aadesh se kaam band ho, kaam ke samay main badlaav kaa aadesh likhit aae
 No staff should be forced to work more than seven consecutive days
 aath ghante se zyada ve kaam na karen, saptaah main 40 ghante hi kaam karne ko kaha jaae
 All Saturdays are a holiday that is rarely met now
 zaahir he bankeron ko isse zyada karnaa padataa he
 Then these things have been mentioned in their demand letter
 ek maang yah bhi he ki dhamkaane or dabaav daalane ke liye tabadale kaa istamaal band kar diya janaa chahie
 Looking at the demand letter, it seems that the bankers want salary but there is a serious decline in working conditions
 isamen pension kii bhi maang he jiske bare main ab koi baat nahin karnaa chahta
 Legislative mps themselves take pension but make policies to ensure that others do not get pension
 aap is vakt screen par gramin dak sevakon ke alag-alag jagahon se bheji gai tasviren dekh rahe, pichley 17 dinon se bharat bhar ke gramin dak sevak hadtaal par hai
 These pictures are of the rural postal servants, who are surprised that their strike is not getting coverage even after having two lakh two hundred postal servants
 jab das lakh banker par koi charchaa nahin he to paune do lakh vaale ko bhi samajhnaa chahie ki media ke loktantr main asli log nahin aate hai
 These postal servants should also ask what they were seeing in newspapers and channels before the strike, what they were reading, whether they have seen the voice of the common people, except for the exception, how their voice would appear when not seen
 gramin daksevakon ne sab karke dekh liya
 Sold the vegetables, took off clothes, there were various problems, but his heart was broken
 unhen laga tha ki desh kii baaki samasyaon kii tarah unke halaat par bhi dibet hoga
 This is a picture of the post office of Faridabad
 hadtaal ke kaaran chitthiyaan padi hai
 How many important papers of people must not be reaching

 While working for 35 years, these postal service packers get only 7-8000 salary

 After 35 years of job, 7000 is not LA
 inkaa kahana he ki chaar saal paanch saal kaam karne ke baad haath main chah hazaar miltaa he, isse inkaa guzaaraa nahin chal rahaa he
