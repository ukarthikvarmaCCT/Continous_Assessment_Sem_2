 Bollywood fans are very happy with Salman Khan's bail in the Black Deer Shikar case
 shanivaar salmaan ko jamaanat milte hi jodhpur se lekar mumbai tak phens ne jamkar aatishbaajiyaan kii or mithai banti
 But the actress and ex Bigg Boss contestant Sophia Hayat are very unhappy with this news
 salmaan ke ghar aate hi katrina milane pahunchi,ye stars bhi aae najarsophia ne soshal media par salmaan khan ke khilaaf post karte hue indian karansi kii tasviir post kii he
 With this, he wrote that Salman got bail after submitting these important documents
 agar sabake paas is tarah ke paper hai to unhen court jane kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Salman has proved that corruption is more prevalent in India than justice
 The important papers submitted by Salman Khans lawyers to get him bail
 Ahh
 
 if everyone had these kind of papers
 
 there would be no need for court systems or judges or even a justice system! Well done India !! You have proved that corruption in India is far stronger than any sort of justice
 So
 
 inject yourself with steroids, teach the young its ok to kill animals and people and abuse women
 
 throw a few dance moves in pants that are far too tight
 
 
 
 and as long as you have these documents
 
 you are king in India! They say Tiger Zinda hai
 
 but in reality it is an endagered species
 
 
 soon to be extinct
 
 let the real hearts rise
 
 i am so sorry to all of you who actually had hope in the Indian Justice system
 
 Keep fighting for the truth
 
 because the truth prevails in the end
 Namaste Shalom salaam

 ghatana ke baad salmaan ne mumbai pahunchaa die the hathiyaar, aise hua khulasabta den guuruuvaar ko salmaan khan ko sajaa sunaae jane ke baad sophia ne khushi jaahir kii thi
 He wrote that he shared a picture of the actor
 jisamen guilty likhaa he
 Along with being human, being cut is written as no more human
 Karma gets you in the end
 
 
 Many people are afraid to talk against Salman because they think he controls Bollywood
 Well, i no longer serve my ego and therefore am not afraid to speak up
 i am so happy that Salman has gone to jail for what he has done
 Animals are so important to this planet and doing what he did and then mocking it was a huge act of his own self importance
 Lots of children look up to him, and he has a responsibility to the young people
 What is he showing the world when he does things like this? What lessons is he giving them? That it is ok to break the law, to kill animals and then mock it because he is a celebrity? In any western country he would have been vilified for this and the drink driving deaths that he caused
 He has then reinvented himself as a charitable man to try and compensate his karma
 Today, India has shown that no matter who you are, if you break the law, you are no bigger than the law
 i have heard so many young people in India speak about how they are afraid to go to the police about crimes committed by others because they watch the TV and see how people with money and status get away with it because they have paid off the police or the judge or the lawyers
 This happened to me when Armaan Kohli paid off 2 of my lawyers so that i could not continue with the case, Dolly Bindra also told me that Armaans family are powerful enough to put drugs in my bag at the airport and i would be in Jail
 i had to then drop the case as all the lawyers i hired were paid off
 Today, Hindustan can stand strong and hold its head up high to the world and show them that justice is held up in India, and today, all the poor people have been shown a glimmer of hope in their own fight for justice against those who have manipulated the law
 Today i can say Hindustaan zindabaad! a post shared bysofia Hayat (@sofiahayat) onapr 5, 2018 at 10:40 am PDT wrote in the photo- Finally you get the fruits of your actions
 bahut se log salmaan ke khilaaf bolne se darate hai, kyonki unhen lagata he salmaan bollywood ko control karte hai
 But i am not afraid of anyone
 mujhe khushi he ki jo salmaan ne kiya uske liye unhen jail janaa padaa
 Let me tell you, Indian model British actress and actress Sophia Hayat took part in Bigg Boss-7 in 2013

 Congress President Rahul Gandhi, on the second day of his visit, addressing the election public meetings in Sagar and Damoh on Saturday, attacked PM Modi and the Shivraj government fiercely
 rahul ne damoh kii raily main sambodhit karte hue kaha, 'modi or shivaraj main ek fark he
 Shivraj ji speaks from Tamizh and Narendra Modi ji does not know how to speak from Tamizh
 dukh hota he ki wo desh ke pradhanmantri hai, unhen desh kii janata ne chunaa he, lekin main unke khilaaf ek bhi shabd galat nahin boluungaa
 'corruption done but not development,' he said, adding that Shivraj attacks, but he speaks with tameez
 narendra modi tameez se bolnaa nahin jaanate
 This is very sad
 vah kuch bhi bole desh ke pradhanmantri hai, lekin rahul gandhi unke bare main budtamiji se kabhi nahin bolegaa
 Rahul Gandhi said that we are fighting Shivraj ji with open and fierce fight
 magar wo tameez se bol rahe hai
 There is a difference between the two
 aap kahenge rahul gandhi chif minster kii prashansa kar rahe hai, lekin sachai he to bolnaa padegaa
 Corruption has been done, but they have not developed, but the person talks to Tameez
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki shivaraj ne 15 saal raaj kiya, kamiyaan to hai
 Have made mistakes
 shivaraj sarkaar jaale hue tave kii tarah kharaab ho gai he
 In such a situation, there is only one way left
 haath se puraane tave ko uthaakar baahar phenkna he
 Rahul said that now in the speech of PM, there is no talk of farmers, neither there is talk of employment of youth nor there is talk of corruption
 ab ho nafrat kii baat karte hai
 Talk angrily and speak in lies
 iskaa kaaran he narendra modi jaanate hai jo bharosa kisaanon yuvaaon ke the wo tut gaye hai
 Now when the public hears Modi's speech, he looks at him and says, "look, he has come to tell lies
" unki man kii baat ko modi samajhate hai to wo hamaare parivaar or party ko bura bhala kehane lagate hai
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that the entire benefit of Vyapam scam has been received by the people of RSS and the family of Shivraj Singh Chauhan
 rahul ne kaha, 'maine jab galati se panama paper main shivaraj chouhan ji ke bete kaa naam liya to turant manahani kaa maamla darj kara diya, lekin jab vyapam, danpar cond, i-tendering main unka naam liya tab manahani kaa maamla kyon nahin darj karaayaa?bijepi kaa CM chori karne main jutarahul ne kaha ki har pradesh main bijepi kaa mukhyamantri koi na koi chori karne main juta he
 The son of Rajasthan Chief Minister took money from Lalit Modi, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister's son's name came in Panama paper, Shivraj Chauhan is here in Vyapam, Dumper scandal and e-tendering
 rahul gandhi ne kaha ki ek mahila ne hamaare party ke kaaryakarta se kaha ki rasoi kaa tawa 10 saal main kharaab ho jaataa he
 The bread cooked on it burns
 isi tarah se shivaraj singh chouhan kii sarkaar tawa jaise kharaab ho chuki he

 Addressing an election rally in Raisen, Rahul said that now that Modi makes a speech, the public sees when the meeting will end
 rahul ne kaha ki sabase bada ghotaalaa notebandi he
 If demonetisation was a fight against black money, then why only farmers, laborers and small traders were seen in the line, why did the suit-booters not appear
 rahul ne kaha ki modi ne 3
 5 lakh crores waived
 manaregaa chalaane ke liye saal ke 35 hajaar karod rupye lagate hai
 For 10 such MNREGA, he has 3 of 15 people
 5 lakh karod rupye maaf kar die
 The youth of the state, especially the youth of this constituency here, say that our industry has closed down, Modi ji, what was there before is over, jobs are over

 BJP national president Amit Shah is said to be a skilled diplomat
 iskaa saboot wo pichley kai chunaavon main de bhi chuke hai
 The latest example is from UP
 vahaan amit shah ne bijepi ke liye is tarah kii fielding set kii thi ki uske saamne akhilesh-rahul gandhi jaise ‘upi ke ladakon’’ kaa gathbandhan ho yaa ‘bahanji’ mayawati kaa santhnik kaushal, sab chaaron khaane chit najar aae
 The challenge for Amit Shah at this time is to maintain the bjp's dominance in the home state of Gujarat
 gujarat sirf amit shah kaa hi nahin pradhanmantri narendra modi kaa bhi grih rajya he
 Anyway, in the last five assembly elections in Gujarat, BJP has been waving the victory record
 isliye gujarat main bijepi ke liye yah saakh kaa sawaal he
 With a sharp eye up to the booth level, Amit Shah does not want to let any wrong happen on the organizational front in Gujarat
 yahi vajah he ki chunaav se judi har choti-badi baat par amit shah khud paini najar rakhe hue hai
 At the same time, he has given special responsibility to his trusted people in Gujarat according to his efficiency
 bijepi chunaavon main panna pramukhon or booth incharge kii bhoomika ko bahut ahm maanati he
 This is the reason that for all the 182 assembly seats of Gujarat, it is the responsibility of 182 assembly in-charge to take feedback from more than one million Panna chiefs and 58 thousand booth incharge
 gujarat main 182 vidhansabha seat inchrjon se bijepi ke gujarat sanghathan mantri bhikhubhai dalsania feedback lete hai
 Bhikubhai Dalsania has been looking after the work of Organization Minister of Gujarat since 2004
 is bhoomika ke taur par unhone do loksabhaa chunaavon or do vidhansabha chunaavon main sanghathan kii jimmedaari nibhaai he
 Based on the feedback received from all over the place, Amit Shah and his team decide the condition and direction of the strategy according to the need of the hour
 isamen soshal media chunavi ranneeti bhi shaamil he
 BJP Overseas Convenor Vijay Chautharwala is responsible for implementing the social media campaign on social media campaign
 chauthaiwala 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main piem modi ke soshal media kii jimmedaari kushalta se nibhaa chuke hai
 Pankaj Shukla is also in this team
 chauthaiwala ko piem modi or amit shah donon kaa hi vishwaasapaatr mana jaataa he
 What will be the party's favor, how to take up the issue in media, which leader will hold a press conference on which issue, this work is done by bjp's national co-media chief Sanjay Mayukh, party general secretary Bhupendra Yadav

 Gujarat BJP in-charge Bhupendra Yadav and BJP general secretary Ramlal are in direct phone contact with BJP candidates and district presidents in all 182 seats
 ummidavaaron kii sabhi samasyaon ko sulajhane kii jimmedaari inhen par he
 The BJP has divided the entire Gujarat election into four zones
 party ne jin chaar kendriya mantriyon ko gujarat kaa sah prabharee banaaya hai unako ek ek zone kaa prabharee bana diya hai
 These include Narendra Singh Tomar, Nirmala Sitharaman, Jitendra Singh and PP Chaudhary

 If any other senior minister stays in the campaign, he also stays in the meeting
 isi baithak main party kii agle din kii ranneeti kaa khaakaa taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Both Prime Minister Modi and Amit Shah are well aware that these elections are different from the last three assembly elections in the state
 pichley teenon vidhansabha chunaav bijepi ne narendra modi ko party ke mukhyamantri chehre ke taur par aage karke lade the
 This time the CM face of the party is Vijay Rupani, not Modi
 bijepi hai kaman ne roopaani ko anandiben patel ko hataa kar gujarat ke mukhyamantri kii gaddi par bithaaya tha
 Vijay Rupani comes from the Jain community, whose vote share in Gujarat is about two per cent
 naaraaz maane ja rahe patidaar samudaay ko is chunaav main sadhana bhi bijepi ke liye badi chunauti he
 The writing on the wall is clear that PM Modi and Amit Shah's pair do not want to let the party make any mistakes in the Gujarat elections
 yahi vajah he ki sabase bharose ke sipahasalaron ko chun-chun kar chunaav ke khaas morchon par tainaat kiya gaya he

 sho main dikhaaya gaya tha ki sikandar kii duusari patni apni beti ko jehar de detii he
 The reason for this is not that she does not want him, but to divert the attention of Alexander from Kulfi to himself
 sho ke is plot ko phens ne pasand nahin kiya
 There was a lot of controversy about this on social media

 While the Congress has come out on the street to say hello, on Thursday, BSP chief Mayawati has launched a big attack on the BJP
 mayawati ne kaha ki bijepi jab se satta main ai he, tab se baba sahab ke dwaara banaae gaye samvidhan ko nasht karne main lagi he
 BJP is attacking democracy by misusing government machinery

 The BSP has managed to win one seat

 chunavi nattejey ke baad sarkaar banane ke liecongress or jedies ne haathmila, lekin rajyapal ne bijepi ko sarkaar banane kaa nimantran diya tha
 The matter then reached the Supreme Court, but the opposition could not stop Yeddyurappa's swearing-in

 We have to fight unitedly

 vadodara main centre for culture and deveopment ke research kansaltent dow jyesh shah ne bataaya, "aisa nahin he ki sirf adivasee ilaake main kuposhan ke maamle paae jate hai
 This is also a serious problem in the urban area
 iske liye hamen food habit ko badalanaa aavashyak hoga
 "malnutrition based on residence - 38% rural - 49% Malnutrition based on mother's child's education - 57% mother studying up to high school - 41% mother studying up to graduation - 32% mother's business On the basis of malnutrition, family farming / occupation - 56% working outside the home - 61% own business - 40% housewife - 37% Dr
 Jayesh Shah stated, "40 percent of the children in the 0-6 years group are malnourished
 aise bacchon kii mrityu dar bhi 45 pratishat aanki gai he
 Which is truly quite serious
 gujarat main shahar or gaanvon main kuposhan kii samasya se jujhane ke liye sarkaar ne badi-badi buildings bana di hai magar vahaan staff hi nahin hai
 Meaning the government is making hardware but they do not know the importance of software

 According to Dr

 aise main vividh enjio or prabhavi logon ke saath hi is samasya ke nirmulan ke liye hallaa bol karnaa padegaa tabhi gujarat shashakt ho paaegaa
 " jaraa sochie, ek din aap jaagate hai or dekhte hai ki aapke fain-mail kaa jawaab aayaa he, to vah din aapke liye kaisaa hoga
 Surely you will start flaunting this thing in the morning itself

 Two people are waiting to return to Delhi
 rahul gandhi or arvind kejariwal
 Arvind is silent at the moment but his audio recording speaks a lot
 audio recording kii pramanikta ham sabit nahin kar sakate, lekin aam aadmi party ke netaa khud hi usamen kahi gai baton ko sabit kar chuke hai
 By the way, i am not very excited about the sting on a personal level
 lekin soshal media par kai logon ne abhadra bhashaa main anurodh kiya to laga ki shaleen bahes to ho hi sakati he
 In the midst of this fierce heat, the tensions facing AAP supporters in social media should go to Bengaluru
 dekhnaa chahie ki unke netaa kis tarah santulan or sambhaav kii sthiti main dhyaan or yoga kii mudra main hai
 Hopefully you will be thinking about the answers to your questions in this pose
 kathith rup se audio sidi main unki jo awaz he us par bolnaa to banataa he
 By the way, there have been leaders in our politics who do not answer on some issues and get questions written before the interview
 aise kai netaa pichley das baarah saalon se chup hi hai
 But even if Arvind Kejriwal, who claims new and open politics, will not speak, then it will happen that those whom he has been questioning will also have to be declared saints
 hamaare netaa sant hi hote hai
 Seeing their silence during such tension, those supporters should start watching the cartoon channel, which are always going through the stress of tweeter on Twitter
 arvind kii jo tasviri satviktaa nazar aa rahi he usase to yahi lag rahaa he ki kuch nahin bigadaa he
 The amount of audio CD that has come in public is not a matter of money or position transactions
 lekin ek party ke vidhayakon se sampark kaa prayaas ri-allinement he jod tod nahin, yah baat hajam nahin hoti he
 If BJP starts contacting Aam Aadmi Party mlas, will it be called manipulation or political re-alignment
 kya tab bhi ashish khetaan kahenge ki ye to hota rahaa he, ho rahaa he or hoga
 As he stated in the context of the CD
 ham maanate hai ki polytical ri-allinement hota rahaa he, hota he or hota rahegaa
 Political re-alignment is not manipulative
 tepe se bilkul pataa nahin chalata ki hamane aniatik tareeke se congress kaa samarthan hasil kiya
 Those Congress mlas were in touch with our MLA and it was in Delhi's interest to form the government
 us vakt bijepi bhi harse-trading se sarkaar banane kaa prayaas kar rahi thi
 There is an issue of authenticity
 kya pataa kaant-chhaant kar saamne laai gai hon, lekin kumaar vishwaas ne hi sweekaar kiya he ki audio sidi unhen rajesh garg ne di thi jise unhone party ke varisht netaaon ko de diya tha
 Did not tell which leader it was given
 kya party ke lokapal ko vah sidi di gai
 Did the party then conduct a forensic investigation or an FIR
 ye baat sahi he ki rajesh garg chunaav ke dauraan li karte to aaj jitna hangaamaa ho rahaa he usase zyada hi hota, lekin sawaal samay kaa nahin, un baton kaa he jo har samay lagu hai
 Now let's decorate some old events
 20 may 2014 ko hindu akhbaar kii hedline he ki arvind kejariwal ne leftinent garvanar se ek hafte kaa samay maanga ki ve dilli ke logon kii raay lenge or sarkaar banane kii sambhaavnaaon kii talash karenge
 On the same day, State Congress President Arvinder Singh Lovely said that Congress will not support AAP
 party chunaav chaahati he
 Mail online of June 10 and India Today's news of June 11 states that Aam Aadmi Party MLA Rajesh Garg has gone beyond the party line and appealed to Congress mlas to support the Aam Aadmi Party in forming the government
 garg sahab ne apil kii thi or ab kharid-farokht kaa aarope laga rahe hai
 In this case, Arvind Kejriwal changed the line several times and also raised questions
 is dauraan aap ke bhi kuch vidhayakon ne aarope lagaaya ki bijepi paise or pad kaa pralobhan dekar kharidne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 The BJP refused
 arvind kejariwal ne vidhayakon se kaha ki party ko badnaam karne ke liye unka sting ho saktaa he, lekin khud kejariwal kaa hi ho gaya he, yah nahin bataaya
 On July 3, the Aam Aadmi Party meets the President and demands fresh elections
 4 july ko supreme court ne arvind kejariwal kii yachika sanvaidhanik peeth ko bhej di
 Arvind demanded to dissolve the assembly and hold elections
 19 july ke indian express kii khabar main congress ke vidhayak asif khan or hasan ahamed ne mana ki congress aam aadmi party se sarkaar banane ko lekar baat kar rahi thi
 Some Congress leaders had said that talks would have taken place if allegations of horse trading were not made
 21 july ko arvind kejariwal up-rajyapal se milte hai or harse-trading rokane ke liye jaldi chunaav kii baat karte hai
 In order to understand the audio CD, old newspaper clippings should be put forward so that the Ashish Khetaniya doctrine of political re-alignment can be properly discussed
 us vakt congress saarvajanik rup se chunaav kii baat kar rahi thi, lekin uske vidhayakon ne kaha party aap se milakar sarkaar bana rahi he
 At that time the Aam Aadmi Party was talking about elections and was internally contacting Congress mlas
 bijepi bhi sarkaar banane kaa daawa kar hi rahi thi
 Now it is up to Chief Minister Arvind how they come out of meditation posture and respond
 congress se baatcheet party ke str par ho rahi thi yaa vidhayakon se vyaktigat str par
 There is a difference between the two
 polytical ri-allinement party ke str par hota he yaa vyaktigat vidhayak ko phod kar hota he
 If it happens, who would be called manipulative? kathith audio sidi main kathith taur par arvind rajesh garg ko kah rahe hai ki main bataaun aapako, aap in 6 ko alag karwaane kaa hi shuru karwaao
 Separate 6 people, form your own party and support us from outside
 is sidi main arvind teen musalamaanon kii baat kar rahe hai
 Many party leaders and we journalists also say this in their articles about Muslim leaders
 lekin imam bukhari kii apil ko saarvajanik rup se thukraa kar bahadur banane nikali party ke netaa band kamare main agar kisi vidhayak ke musalmaan hone par ummid paalen to ise kya kahenge
 Will talk in prime time
 is bich beemaa bill paas ho gaya he
 a lot has happened in the meantime, but in the meantime this question is troubling everyone, who was thought to be new, is not like the old one

 film 'jowar bhaata' ne box offis par zyada kamaal nahin dikhaaya, par actress 'nur jahaan' ke saath 1947 main ai 'jugnu' film ne box offis par acchhee kamai kii or dilip kumaar kaa naam log jaanane lage

 In Parliament, there are repeated arguments between the ruling and opposition leaders within the House, but it is only occasionally that a member of the opposition sends a chocolate to a minister
 aaj rajyasabha ke bheetar ek aisa hi najaara dekhne ko mila
 Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan took up the matter in the Rajya Sabha during the Zero Hour that the government is talking a lot about digital economy and cashless payment but is not taking necessary steps to make it firm
 jaya bachchan ne kaha ki notebandi bagaiyr taiyaari ke uthaaya gaya ek aisa kadam tha, jisase logon ko kaaphi pareshaani hui
 But at that time it was said that this would help in creating a cashless economy
 jaya bachchan ne kaha ki sarkardigital pementki baat to karti he, lekin uske liye jaruri sansaadhan muhaiyaa nahin karaae ja rahe hai
 Shopkeepers are finding it very difficult to get a point of sale (POS) machine to accept payment from the card
 unhone kaha ki desh main 20 lakh point of cell mashin kii jarurat he, jabaki sirf 15 lakh mashin hi uplabdh he
 Shopkeepers are still unable to buy this machine
 duusari taraf bank card se pement ke badale moti fees vasuul rahe hai, jiskaa boj dukandaaron par pad rahaa he
 He said that if the government really wants to promote digital payments, it should reduce the fees on card payments
 unhone kaha ki sarkaar ne bhim ap se lekar aadhaar besd pement or upiai jaisi itane tarah kii sarvice ek saath shuru kar di he ki logon main isko lekar asamanjas or bhram he
 The result is that the number of people making digital payments is increasing but the amount of transaction is decreasing
 jaya bachchan ne yah bhi sawaal uthaaya kii digital iconomi banane ke liye logon ko jis tarah kii training die jane kii jarurat he vah uplabdh nahin he
 IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad arose to answer
 unhone kaha ki yah aarope sahi nahin he ki sarkaar ne isaki bilkul taiyaari nahin kii
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that till now more than two crore people have downloaded the Bhima app and it has done a transaction of Rs 1500 crore
 lekin unhone yah baat maani ki jaya bachchan ne jo suzav die hai, vah gaur karne ke kaabil hai or sarkaar un par vichaar karegi
 Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the government will take steps to overcome the problems faced by digital payments
 ravishankar prasad jab jawaab de kar baithe to jaya bachchan ne apane purse se chocolate nikaalkar use ek kaagaj main lapet kar ravishankar prasad ke paas bhijwaya
 Ravi Shankar Prasad smilingly accepted the gift

 After the Lok Sabha, the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) has also been passed in the Rajya Sabha
 bill ke paksh main 125 vot pade jabaki iske khilaaf 99 sadasyone vot kiya
 Shiv Sena walked out of Rajyasabha during voting

 The matter belongs to the AAP government of Delhi
 janata menswine flu ke khaufko kam karne ke liye 19 farvari ko dilli kii AAP sarkaar ne helpline number jari kiye the
 But contacting them is crooked
 yah sthiti tab he jab desh bhar main 700 se zyada logon kii maut swine flu ke kaaran ho chuki he
 Help The Delhi Government had issued two helpline numbers 1800-114-377 and 011-22307145 to give information about swine flu, but they are getting a busy tone
 haalanki kendriya swasthya tathaa parivaar kalyaan mantralay ne bhi ek helpline number 011-23921401 jari kiya he, yahaan aapako thodi-bahut jaankaree mil sakati he
 The death toll due to swine flu across the country has crossed seven hundred
 isse sankramit logon kii sankhya bhi gyaarah hajaar se zyada ho gai he
 The most affected states include Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh but now this infection has caught up to Mizoram

 He then contested on RJD ticket
 2009 main wo jediu kii tikat par karakaat seat jeet kar loksabhaa pahunch gaye
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Upendra Kushwaha of Rashtriya Lok Samata Dal lost from Karakat
 jaise-jaise loksabhaa chunaav kii tareekhen najadik aa rahi hai, sargharmiyabhi badhati ja rahi hai
 Maharashtra is also not far from it, as Maharashtra plays an important role in reaching the seat of the center
 loksabhaa kii siton ke maamle main uttar pradesh ke baad maharashtra duusare number par he
 There are a total of 48 Lok Sabha seats here
 aise main raajnneetik partiyon dwaara siyaasi daanv-pench lagaana lajimi he
 The direct contest in Maharashtra is between the bjp-shiv Sena alliance and the congress-ncp (nationalist Congress Party)
 aapako bataaden kimaharashtra main 11, 18, 23 or 29 april ko chaar charnon main chunaav hona he
 According to official figures, out of total 8,73,29,910 voters in the state, 1,19,95,027 voters aged 18 to 19 will exercise the franchise for the first time
 kul matadaataaon main 4,57,01,877 purush or 4,16,25,950 mahilaayein hai or 2,083 third gendermatadaata hai
 After unprecedented performances in Maharashtra and Haryana, the bjp's spirits are fully elevated and even if not, the BJP is witnessing the most golden phase of its lifetime
 aise main ab nazren dilli par lagi hai ki aakhir dilli main kya hoga, sarkaar banegi yaa chunaav honge? On Monday, Delhi BJP President Satish Upadhyay, in a conversation with NDTV India, hinting about the election in Delhi, said that the impact of the tsunami that occurred in Haryana, you will definitely see the effect in Delhi, also in the form of numbers
 And anyway
 haalanki is par party main koi faisla nahin hua he, saath hi supreme court main 28 oktober ko is maamle main sunwaayee bhi he, jisamen dilli ke uparajyapal adaalat ko yah bataaenge ki aakhir dilli ke bare main vah kya faisla le rahe hai
 Discussion in political circles is that the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi sought the President's opinion to invite the BJP as the largest party to form the government, to which the President returned the file without giving any opinion
 is par aupchaarik sthiti abhi tak saaf nahin hai, shaayad 28 oktober kii sunwaayee main baat saaf ho paae
 As far as the Aam Aadmi Party is concerned, she is still challenging the BJP and saying that if you have the courage, hold elections
 aam aadmi party is baat par jor de rahi he ki dilli main bijepi ke paas arvind kejariwal kii takkar kaa mukhyamantri ummidavaar nahin hai, isliye jab dilli main chunaav honge, to dilli kii janata kejariwal ke naam par aam aadmi party ko vot degi
 1
 bijepi kii sabase badi takat hai pradhanmantri narendra modi, jinke naam par in dinon voter camel par batan dabaata he or vot bijepi ko padataa he 2
 desh main prachand bahumat, haryana main pehali baar sarkaar or maharashtra main pehali baar bijepi kaa mukhyamantri banane ke asaar se bijepi form main he
 The organization is strong and the enthusiasm in the cadre is sustained by successive victories
 3
 Party in strong position in middle class 4
 Large presence of Narendra Modi and Hindutva supporters on social media 2
 There is no such face to be declared as CM candidate, who can compete with Arvind Kejriwal
 apane-apane ilaakon main to bahut netaa hai, jo siem kii res main hai, lekin ve puri dilli ke str ke nahin hai
 1
 arvind kejariwal aam aadmi party ke cheharaa hai or voter inke naam par jhaadu kaa batan dabaata he 2
 kejariwal is samay dilli main maujuud sabhi pradesh str ke netaaon main sabase charchit siem candidet hai 3
 aarthik rup se kamjor tabake main party kaa janaadhar majboot he 4
 soshal media par party or kejariwal samarthakon kii maujuudagi acchhee-khaasi he 1
 dilli main sarkaar se istipha dena aaj bhi logon ke man main kejariwal or aam aadmi party ke prati rujhaan kam karne or naaraazgi kaa sabase bada kaaran he 2
 aae din party ke vidhayak yaa netaa kuch aisa kar dete hai, jisase party yaa kejariwal sawaalon ke ghere main aa jate hai
 This affects the credibility of the party in general public
 3
 While the party was overwhelmingly popular in the last assembly elections in the middle class, now the party's decreased popularity in the middle class remains a challenge for it, the result of which was seen in the Lok Sabha elections
 jahaan tak congress kaa sawaal he, to kuch din pehle aisa lag rahaa tha ki chunaav hone par congress kuch chadh sakati he, lekin haryana chunaav ke nateezon ke baad ab saaf lagata he ki muqabla sidhe bijepi banaam aap hi hoga
 In such a situation, when the BJP is in the hands of holding elections in Delhi, it is assessing whether conducting the elections remains the only option or if something else can happen and if elections are to be held, then when will it be okay to do it
 duusari taraf aam aadmi party bhi apni prachaar kii ranneeti bana rahi he, kyonki yah chunaav uske astitv se judaa hua he
 It is a matter of respect for the BJP to form a government in Delhi, as it has been out of power in Delhi for the last 16 years
 duusari taraf, aam aadmi party ke liye yah uske astitv kaa sawaal he, kyonki uskaa sabase bada janaadhar agar kahin he, to keval dilli main he or agar vah dilli na jeet pai, to phir kya karegi
 Let us wait and see who is in the destiny of Delhi, because the future of Delhi may be decided in the coming few days
 bhaajapa ne aaj kaha ki do kendriya mantri shashi tharur or pi chidambaram jis tarah aam aadmi kaa ‘apmaan’ kar rahe hai, agar ve kisi saarvajanik yaa nijee seva main hote to barkhaast kar die jate
 Disgraced middle class: Party spokesperson Rajeev Pratap Rudy told reporters that Tharoor has insulted the middle class by calling the economy class of the aircraft as 'flocks' and Chidambaram advised Delhiites to learn manners and conduct
 unhone kaha ki aam aadmi ke naam par satta main ai samprag sarkaar ko is baat kaa jawaab dena chahie ki vah madhya varg ke peeche kyon padi he
 Why are his two ministers constantly insulting the middle class and why is the government forgiving him instead of taking action
 gujarat kii raajnneeti main madhya gujarat kii khaas ahmiyat he
 It will not be wrong if it is said that the throne of state power is decided through Central Gujarat
 yahi vajah he ki bijepi ne is saal hone vaale chunaav ke liye apana bigul madhya gujarat se foonka tha or ab congress upaadhyaksh rahul gandhi soobe kii siyaasi jang ko fatah karne ke liye madhya gujarat kii jameen par utre hai
 The special thing is that while BJP is dependent on the urban voters of central Gujarat, Rahul is trying to woo the rural population of this area, especially Dalits and Adivasis
 yahi vajah he ki rahul kal yani 10 oktober ko baba sahib bhimrao ambedkar kii sankalp bhoomi ja rahe hai
 63 assembly seats in central Gujarat 63 seats out of total 182 assembly seats in Gujarat come from central Gujarat
 pichley vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon ko dekhen to madhya gujarat main bhi bijepi kaa danka bajataa rahaa he
 In the 2012 assembly elections, BJP won 40 of the 63 seats in central Gujarat, then Congress won 21, NCP 1 and independents 1
 bijepi kaa garh ahmedabad-vadodramadhya gujarat main ahmedabad, dahod, kheda, aanand, narmada, panchmahal, vadodara jile aate hai
 Of these, Ahmedabad and Vadodara are strong bastions of the BJP
 ye donon jile shahari kshetra main hai
 Talking about the results of the last assembly election, BJP won 17 of the total 21 assembly seats in Ahmedabad, while the Congress got just 4 seats
 vadodara kii 13 siton main se bijepi ne 10 siton par jeet darj kii to congress ko 2 or 1 seat anya ke khate main gai
 The Congress dominance in rural areas, except Ahmadabad and Vadodara, the rural areas of central Gujarat are considered as Congress dominated
 madhya gujarat ke saat jilon se main paanch jilon dahod, kheda, aanand, narmada, panchmahal main gramin aabaadi zyada he
 In the last assembly elections, either the Congress has got a heavy upper hand in these districts or the contest has been equal
 madhya gujarat ke kheda jile kii 7 vidhansabha siton main congress ko 5 siten mili, to bijepi ko mahaj 2
 In the 7 assembly seats of Anand district, Congress got 4 seats, BJP 2 and others got 1 seat
 dahod kii 6 siton main se 3 bijepi or 3 congress ko milin
 There are 7 seats in Panchmahal district, out of which BJP got 4 and Congress got 3 seats, while BJP won both seats in Narmada
 bijepi kii kamjor hoti pakadmadhya gujarat ke siyaasi faisle main kisaanon,patidaaron or adivaasiyonki ahm bhoomika rahati he
 The BJP has been continuously occupying the throne of power due to its strong hold on the Patidars and farmers
 raajnneetik jaankaron kaa maananaa he ki pichley kuch dinon main bijepi kii pakad madhya gujarat main kamjor hui he
 The Patidar Reservation Movement, led by Sardar Patel's birthplace, a political exercise led by Hardik Patel in 2015, is believed to have angered the Patel community
 yahi vajah he ki pichley dinon bijepi adhyaksh amit shah ne gujarat ke dipti siem nitin patel ke netritv main sardaar patel kii janmabhumi se gaurav yatra kaa aagaaj kiya
 At the same time, Rahul Gandhi will also go to Nadiad, the birthplace of Sardar Patel
 congress or bijepi patel samudaay ko apane-apane paksh main karne kii jaddojahad main lage hai or sardaar patel kaa janmasthan unke liye siyaasi akhaada ban gaya he
 Along with Patel, Rahul is also considered to be the stronghold of tribals and farmers of Ambedkar, a state of western Gujarat
 adivasee matadaata congress ke paksh main hai, yahi vajah he ki pichley chunaav main adivasee kshetron vaali seat par congress ne jeet darj kii thi
 Rahul Gandhi will meet the tribals on a tour of central Gujarat
 10 oktober ko rahul vadodara main baba sahib ambedkar kii 'sankalp bhoomi' bhi jaaenge
 Through this, the exercise is to strengthen its hold on the Dalits and Adivasis of the state

 agar sab kuch thik hota to nirmala sitaraman bharat ke sabase viraat dream bajet kii praneta ban jaatin
 With the corporate tax cuts on 20 September, Nirmala p
 chidambaram (1997-98 korporate, vyaktigat inakam tex, exise, custom main baari katautee) se bada itihaas banaaya
 But this is an economy and there is no guarantee that similar decisions will lead to similar results
 1
 Fireworks worth Rs 5 lakh crore (unprecedented reduction in tax on corporate earnings) are over
 jin chuninda companiyon to yah tohfa mila he, unamem adhikansh ise graahakon se nahin baantengi balki pachaa jaaengi
 Savvy and intelligent of the stock market have started planning the opposite effect of this vitamin, saving their savings from the crumbling indices
 kyonki is khuraaq ke baad bhi companiyon kii kamai ghatane kaa dar he kyonki bazaar main maang nahin he
 The way the government works on companies is unique
 modi sarkaar ne apane pehle kaarykaal main companiyon par jamkar tex thopa
 The effective rate of tax (after deducting concessions etc
) on earnings of top companies listed on the stock market was 27 per cent in 2014, which rose to 33 per cent in 2019
 ab ise ghataakar 27
 6 percent has been done
 koun jawaab degaa ki audyogic nivesh to 2014 se gir rahaa he to tex kyon badha yaa nae bajet main companiyon kii kamai par sarcharge kyon badhaayaa gaya? lekin hamen yah pataa he ki taaja tex riyaayat bharat ke itihaas kaa sabase bada korporate tohfa he• crisil ne bataaya ki 1,074 badi companiyon (2018 main kaarobaar 1,000 karod rupye se upar) ko is riyaayat se sabase zyada yani 37,000 karod rupye kaa sidhaa phayda pahonchega, jo kul korporate tex sangrah main 40 fisad hissaa rakhti hai
 The tax on these was higher than other companies
 • ye companiyaan kareeb 80 udyogon main faili hai
 And 70% of the market capitalization of the National Stock Exchange, so there was a bubble in the stock market boom
 • 2018 main kareeb 25,000 companiyon ne munafa kamaaya jo sarkaar ke kul tex sangrah main 60 fisad yogadan karti hai
 In light of some basic facts of the economy, the market and investment are asking themselves how tax exemption to 1,000 companies will return the demand and how will the recession go away? The domestic savings figure raises the biggest question on the relevance of this concession to companies
 is
 pichley varshon main nivesh yaa maang ghatane se companiyon kii bachat par koi fark nahin padaa
 Private corporate savings in 2019 were at several decades high (12 per cent) to GDP ratio
 duusari taraf, aam logon kii bachat (houseold sevings) kai dashak ke sabase nichle str (3 fisad) par he
 Savings and consumption have collapsed due to declining income of common people
 riyaayat kii to jarurat inhen thi, diggaj companiyon ke paas nivesh ke laayak sansadhano kii kami nahin he
 With the reduction of tax and lower interest rate on loans, savings of big companies will increase, not consumption in the market
 bharat kii mandi puunji gahan ke bajaae shram gahan udyogon main zyada gahari he jo sabase zyada rojgaar dete hai
 55 per cent of the tax earned from corporate earnings comes from industries like oil gas, consumer goods, exports (information technology, pharma, ratnabhushan) etc
 While the manufacturing or heavy investment sectors employing only ten per cent of the tax
 
 inhen is riyaayat se koi bada laabh nahin milane vaala
 The bill for this corporate gift is very heavy! In view of the slowing pace of tax collection and pressure on profits, the government is pleased with the treasure 2
 1 lakh karod rupye kaa boj daalegi jo jidipi ke anupaat main 1
 Is up to 2 percent
 iskaa zyada nuksaan rajya uthaaenge
 The share of states in central taxes will decrease by about 40 percent
 centre sarkaar vitt ayog kii marfat, rajyon ko centre se milane vaale sansadhano main katautee bhi karana chaahati he
 If this happens, there is a definite cut in spending in the states
 sanad rahe ki rajyon kaa kharch hi sthaneey arthvyavasthaaon main maang kaa sabase bada eendhan he
 America's latest experience of tax concessions on corporate earnings is the advice
 donald trump ne korporate tex main baari (35 se 21 fisad) katautee kii thi
 That too when the US economy had recovered from the recession, the interest rate was minimal and the stock market was buzzing
 tex ghatane ke baad america share bazaar ne chalaangen lagaayee, companiyon kii kamai badi lekin 21 maah baad america kaa jidipi apane shikhar se ek fisad ludhak chukaa he, share bazaar tab kii tulana main keval 5 fisad upar he, nivesh kii raftaar sust ho gai, upabhoktaaon kaa mood udhaas he or ghaataa badha hua he
 Milton Freedman is going to prove right again that governments' solutions often exacerbate problems! *** kashmir main internet kii seva thap rahane ke chalate pakistan bharat kii aalochana karata rahaa he, lekin ek antarrashtriya report ne is baat kaa khulaasa kiya he ki lagaataar nau saal se internet upyog ke maamle main pakistan swatantra nahin he
 With this, Pakistan has scored 26 to 100 in this case compared to 27 last year
 freedom house (gaiyr sarkari sanghathan) ne mangalvaar ko 'da chrysis of soshal media' sheershak ke saath apni freedom on da net (effotian) report ko jari kiya, jisamen june 2018 se may 2019 ke bich vaishvik internet swatantraaa main samgr giravat darj kii gai he
 According to Dawn News report, Pakistan is ranked 26th out of 100 (worst) in the report, one place below last year's ranking
 internet ke upyog main aane vaali baadhaon ke liye is desh ne 25 main se 5 score kiya he, internet par search kii jane vaali chizon kii simit maatra main pakistan ne 35 main se 14 score kiya he or upyogkarta adhikaar suchakank ke ulanghan ke maamle main pakistan ne 40 main se saat ank praapt kiye hai
 Globally, Pakistan is one of the ten worst countries in terms of internet and digital media freedom
 kshetreey rekking ke maamle main pakistan, vietnam or china ke baad teesraa sabase kharaab desh he
 Apart from the deterioration in Internet freedom, the report also found that elections in Pakistan have also been manipulated through informational tactics including anti-bias commentators, bots (internet programs) or news sites to spread misleading or inaccurate information
 Also included are technical tricks such as international restrictions on connectivity and blocking of websites

 During this, Mamta presented sweets and kurta to PM Modi
 saath hi piem ko bengal aane kaa bhi nyotaa diya
 After meeting PM Modi, Mamta Banerjee said that the discussion with PM was good
 duusare kaarykaal main piem ke rup main kaarybhaar sanbhaalane ke baad main unase nahin mili thi
 Mamta Banerjee said that i have demanded Rs 13500 crore for the state
 saath hi rajya kaa naam parivartan karnaa bhi lambit he
 We are also willing to accept his suggestion
 mamata banerjee ne apni is mulaakaat ko chair tu chair meeting bataaya
 For the first time, the country's most dangerous commando force NSG, the National Security Guards, is preparing its soldiers for new security challenges
 desh ke alag-alag shaharon main hone vaale alag tareeke ke hamalon ko dhyaan main rakhkar javaanon ko train kiya ja rahaa he
 Mock drills are being done to deal with any such challenge
 mock drill main enesji ke dilli headquarter se lekar desh ke duusare hisson main maujuud commando hissaa le rah hai
 The ability to deal with different attacks at the same time through mock drills is being tested
 enesji is baat ko lekar apni pukhta taiyaari karnaa chahta he ki agar kabhi desh ke dushmano ne ek vakt main kai shaharon ko nishaanaa banane kii sajeesh rachi to unhen tatkaal munhtod jawaab diya ja sake
 Let us tell you that the NSG faced such an attack in the 2008 Mumbai attack
 is hamale ko force ne kartin resar bataaya tha
 But now significant progress has been made in technology and strategy
 electronic gajet ke alaava commando bal ne apane kutton ke liye k9 camera system bhi kharid liya he jisaki madad se kisi oparation ke dauraan 360 degree par najar rakhi ja sakati he
 This technique makes the commanders strong to fight against terrorists
 is takanic ke jariye oparational commander ko kute chashme par lage camaron se yah pataa chal jaataa he ki vah kis sandigdh jagah yaa dushman ko dekh rahaa he
 Not only this, special training is being given to NSG commandos to overcome terrorist attacks like Gurdaspur and Pathankot airbases
 bataa den ki mumbai hamale ke baad bharat ne apni suraksha chaak chauband kii he
 So far, Indian security forces have not let any nefarious plans like Mumbai attack succeed
 aise main enesji commandon kii ye mock drill dushmano kii sajeesh fail karne main ahm sabit hogi
 a study said that mobile handsets prices worldwide will decline in the coming years due to increased competition among manufacturers and a focus on the lower middle class
 nolej process outsorcing form eveluesarv ne ek adhyayan main yah nishkarsh nikaala he
 It states that in the coming years, the majority of customers will come from low-middle income (LMI) developing economies

 According to this, where handsets will be cheap in the coming five years, there will be increased features in them

 iske alaava adhyayan main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki aane vaale samay main adhiktar log apane mobile ko badalane ke liye naye phone kharidenge
 He said that the government will not demonetize the Rs 2,000 notes, but will phase them out in a phased manner
 gurumurti ne kaha, "ateet main ham isi tarah kai series ke noton ko chalan se baahar kar chuke hai
 "he said that the government is committed to keeping small notes in circulation
 gurumurti kii tippanee aise samay main ai he, jab sarkaar kaledhan par lagaam lagane ke liye 1,000 rupee ke noton ke vimudrikaran kii baat kah rahi he, duusari taraf usne 2,000 ke note jari kiye hai, jo uske rukh ke prati virodhabhas paidaa karata he
 There was no response from the government, but the RSS thinker has given clarification
 bataa den ki es gurumurti ne centre sarkaar ke notebandi ke kadam ko ‘vittiya pokharan’ jaisaa qaraar diya he or kaha ki isse arthvyavastha main aise badlaav kii ummid he jo ek udhaaharan banegaa
 He said that with this decision, the prices of land property will start to fall and transparency will be increased
 notebandi ko ‘vittiya pokharan’ bataate hue gurumurti ne kaha ki jab logon ke paas adhishesh paisa hota he to unamem aisi vasteen kharidne kii ichha jaagti he jinaki jarurat nahin hoti or is tarah se ‘gaiyr jimmedaarana or hrydayviheen kharch’ ko badhaava miltaa he
 Demonetisation will bring big change
 unhone kaha, ‘jis tarah se pokharan se soch main buniyadi badlaav aayaa
 Who thought that America would think about India
 agar hamane parmaanu pareekshan nahin kiya hota to ve aapaki taraf dekhte hi nahin

 Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has termed demonetisation as a "historic managerial mistake"
 gurumurti ne kaha ki pradhanmantri narendra modi ne notebandi kaa yah kadam isliye uthaaya he taaki samprag sarkaar dwaara 2004 ke baad kii gai ‘arthvyavastha kii badi prabandhkeey bhuulon’ ko dur kiya ja sake
 Gurumurthy's remarks come at a time when the government is talking about demonetisation of Rs 1,000 notes to curb black money, on the other hand it has issued 2,000 notes, which contradicts its stance
 sarkaar kii ore se to is par koi jawaab nahin aayaa, magar aresas ke vichaarak ne safai de di he

 Gurumurthy has described the demonetization move of the central government as 'financial Pokhran' and said that it is expected that such a change in the economy will become an example
 unhone kaha ki is nirnay se jameen jaaydaad kii keemton main giravat kii shuruyaat hogi or paardarshita ko badhaava milegaa
 Describing demonetisation as 'financial pokhran', Gurumurthy said that when people have surplus money, they have a desire to buy goods that are not needed and thus promote 'irresponsible and heartless spending'
 notebandi se bada badlaav aayega
 He said, 'the way Pokhran brought about a fundamental change in thinking
 koun sochataa tha ki america, bharat ke bare main sochega
 If we had not done nuclear tests, they would not have looked at you

 The comments ullekhneey he ki bharat ne 1998 main pokharan main parmaanu pareekshan kiye the or desh un chuninda deshon main shaamil ho gaya jinke paas parmaanu hathiyaaron kii kshamta he
 At the same time, the note ban was announced on the night of 8 November this year, under which the then 1000 and 500 rupee notes were removed from circulation
 purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ne notebandi ko ‘aitihaasik prabandhkeey bhul’ bataaya he
 Gurumurthy said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken this step of demonetisation so that the 'big managerial mistakes of the economy' can be removed after 2004 by the UPA government

 In the name of NPT, China, while replying to the supplementary question of Supriya Sule and Saugat Bose in the Rokilok Sabha of NSG, Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said that i had said earlier, even today, i am saying in the House that China has Procedural topics were raised

 He said that our Congress friends are not accepting GST

 The foreign minister said that but if the Congress does not agree once, shall we say that they will never accept
 ham manaane main lage hai, ho saktaa he ki jiesti isi seshan main paas ho jaae
 We will not sign NPT
 Sushma Swaraj said that the exemption related to non-nuclear nuclear was given to us in 2008, in which it was said to pursue without becoming a member of NPT
 unhone saaf kiya ki ham enpiti par kabhi hastakshar nahin karenge
 We have full commitment for this
 enpiti par pehle kii sarkaar ke stand par kaaymaswaraj ne kaha ki ham iske liye pehle kii sarkaar ko bhi credit dete hai
 Six years since 2008, this commitment was fulfilled by the earlier government and after that the present government is taking it forward

 Bharat Sushma, who has advanced in the way of NSG membership, said that India's failure to achieve NSG membership cannot be considered a diplomatic failure
 yah sahi nahin he
 He said that earlier it was said that India would be able to become a member of NSG

 Dhoni, who is in his 38th year, explained how runs are chased

 Dhoni faced 114 balls

 Before them, this record was in the name of Sunil Gavaskar

 Tiwari believes, 'narasimha Rao did not contest the election, he became the PM

 The defeat also happened only because after actor Dilip Kumar's election campaign, opponents created an uproar over why Yusuf Khan named himself Dilip Kumar

 At that time hardly anyone thought that Tiwari would be present again
 or ve maujuun hue bhi to kis andaaj main
 His number 1 Kothi has again become the center of Congress politics in the Forest Research Institute of Dehradun
 unhone 2002 ke baad koi chunaav nahin ladaa, lekin 2012 main kam-se-kam 7 ummidavaaron ko congress se chunaav ladaaya
 He held meetings for Congress candidates in Haldwani, Ramnagar, Kashipur Sahaspur, Vikasnagar, Jaspur, Rudrapur and Gadarpur and sought votes by road shows
 ve helicopter se jagah-jagah gaye
 According to Congress sources, there was a demand for his campaign in about two dozen seats in Uttar Pradesh, but due to health, it was not possible for Tiwari to campaign there
 unki haddi-pasli or pachan tantra bhale hi kamjor pad gaye hon par unki rag-rag main raajnneeti he or unka dimag ab bhi diggaj netaaon kii tarah kaam karata he
 During the campaign, Tiwari surprised everyone by saying that he could become the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand once again, but only for two and a half years
 dhai saal kyon? isliye ki dhai saal baad ve 90 ke ho jaaenge
 Talking to India Today in his kothi a week before the counting of votes, Tiwari says, "given the age, no longer have to take the reins, give advice
 'lekin unke kamare main maujuud unke samarthak isse sahamat nahin hai
 Anil Kumar Sharma, leader of the Youth Congress, says, "the state needs his guidance
 agle mukhyamantri tiwari ji hi honge
 Tiwari's non-political organization Continuous Development Liaison Committee chairman and industrialist Bharat Sharma also wants Tiwari to be the chief minister for at least six months
 kabhi congressi akhbaar neshnal herald ke vishesh samvaadadaata rahe tiwari patrkaar kii tarah sab sunate hai
 Like a veteran leader, he neither supports nor opposes his words
 vaise, tiwari in dinon betaabi se uttarakhand chunaav ke nateezon kaa intjaar kar rahe hai
 They are unhappy about the results not coming even after a month of voting
 ve kehete hai ki nateeja itane samay tak rokna padaa, yani koi-na-koi kami he
 He says in sarcasm, 'neither eat nor book, what Qureshi (chief Election Commissioner) says, the same
 'tamaam vivaadon or umr ke aakhri padaav par hone ke baavjood aakhir vah kya khaas baat he jo congress kii raajnneeti main tiwari ko ateet nahin banane detii? aise ek vivaad ke baad kai netaaon kaa rajnatik jivan khatm hota dekha gaya he
 The return of porn-watching ministers in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly will not be easy
 aisi hi ek sachhee yaa juthi sex sidi ke baad bihar main ek saansad kaa rajnatik kariyar khatm-sa ho gaya
 The most popular interpretation of Tiwari's stand is that he is a development man and a gentle leader
 lekin dehradun main rahane vaale hindi lekhak or phelo banakar shimla ke indian institute of advance studies (ies) ja rahe om prakaash valmiki iske jawaab main bal thakare kaa ek purana bayaan doharaate hai, 'bade log galat kaam nahin karte
 'they say that Tiwari's social background also works in his favor
 valmiki yaad karte hai, 'pradhanmantri pad ke behad kareeb pahunche dalit netaa jagjivan ram kis tarah apane bete par lage scandle ke aaropon ke boj tale dab gaye the
 'but the Dehradun resident poet and writer Leeladhar Jagudi, who was awarded the Padma Shri, does not agree with this interpretation
 unka kahana he ki bhartiya lok parampara main kisi ko bhi yon aaropon kii vajah se khaarij nahin kiya jaataa
 Even if the allegations against Tiwari are true, he has not done anything wrong according to classical mythology
 jagudi kehete hai, 'congress ne chunaav prachaar main tiwari ko utarkar un par lage aaropon ko dho diya he
 'uttarakhand Pradesh President of Congress and Chief Ministerial candidate in the event of Congress winning the election, Yashpal Arya says that Congress has contested the state under the leadership of party president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi
 haalanki arya 2002 se 2007 ke bich tiwari ke mukhyamantri hone ke daur ko yaad karte hue kehete hai ki 'us dauraan rajya kaa sarvaadhik vikaas hua
 Even Tiwari's opponents do not deny this fact
 tiwari bhi 2009 ke aakhir main hue rajbhavan cond ko yaad karnaa nahin chaahate, 'yah sab kuch nahin he
 Events keep happening, what to say on those things
 'tiwari kii gori-chitti chamadi or jabardast yaaddaasht kaa raaj haih bharpoor neend
 He is very chaitanya even at this age and files a copy of Time magazine and India Today, which has pink, green and yellow slips on it
 unhen yah baat salti he ki blueberi, samsung, soni or nickon jaisi companiyaan bharat main kyon nahin hai
 He says, 'india should stand at par with China, Japan and Korea
 ' ve dakshin bharat kii tulana main uttar bharat ke pichhadane se chintit hai
 On Tiwari's canvas is Uttarakhand, not the country
 kabhi yojana ayog main manmohan singh ke bos rah chuke tiwari uttar pradesh ko chote rajyon main baantne ke bare main kehete hai, 'chote bhai pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko jarur sochna chahie
 In Uttarakhand, it says that the song on which it was composed has settled
 tiwari par narendra singh negi ke loakgeet kii sidi nauchhami narena logon ke bich superhit rahi
 But it seems that not only the cds of Tiwari songs, the cds of Hyderabad Raj Bhavan too have suffered
 -saath main praveen kumaar bhatta Trains were running at full speed on this National Highway No
 24 connecting Ghaziabad and Moradabad, two cities of western Uttar Pradesh
 dilli or lakhanu jaise do mahanagaron ke bich hone kii vajah se is sadak par aam taur par trephic kuch zyada hi hoti he
 Two boys riding in a car passing through the highway are seen on an abandoned suitcase lying on the road
 sadak kinare is tarah suutakes padaa dekh unhen ajeeb lagata he
 So they stop the car
 shuruuaat main donon ne yahi sochaa ki shaayad raste se guzarati kisi gaadi se ye suutakes neeche gir gaya hoga
 Since it was daytime and the area was inhabited
 lihaaja donon bejhijak gaadi se neeche utar kar suutakes ke kareeb pahunch jate hai
 a boy first looked through the suitcase
 lekin wo kaaphi baari tha
 After that, the boys almost screamed as soon as they opened the zip of the suitcase
 suutakes main ek laash thi
 Now after handling themselves for the next few moments, the two boys somehow gained courage and called the police
 chand minuton main police maukey par thi
 Now the police inspected the suitcase closely
 laash kisi purush kii thi
 The age must have been around forty
 puure jism par chot ke anginat nishaan the
 After taking the corpse, the police sent him for post-mortem
 suutakes or laash ke alaava aasapaas se aisi koi duusari cheez nahin mili, jisase marane vaale yaa maarane vaale ke bare koi suraag miltaa
 The first thing Amroha police did was send the news of the unclaimed corpse to all the police stations nearby
 khabar kaa asar bhi hua
 The Ghaziabad police informed the Amroha police about a 40-year-old man missing from his area
 gajiabad kaa ek property dealer abhishek gupta do din se apane ghar se rahasyamayi tareeke se gaayab tha
 The family members had also made a report of his disappearance in Ghaziabad
 to kya suutakes main mili laash abhishek gupta kii he?sach jaanane ke liye abhishek gupta ke gharavaalon ko laash kii shinaakht ke liye bulawaaya gaya
 Doubt came out right
 laash abhishek gupta kii hi thi
 But how did Abhishek get out of the house to go to Moradabad on December 19 in the suitcase? The Ghaziabad police, who had been looking for property dealer Abhishek Gupta, who had been missing for two days, had managed to find him
 magar suutakes main band mili abhishek kii laash kaa sach abhi dhundhna baaki tha
 It was yet to be ascertained who finally brought Abhishek to the suitcase
 The answer to this question was hidden in the motive of the murder and the murderer could not be reached until the motive was ascertained
 lihaaja shuruyaat abhishek ke ghar se hi hoti he
 Abhishek's family is questioned
 magar gharavaale cese par koi khaas roshni nahin daal pate
 On the other hand, the way the corpse was slaughtered in a suitcase and disposed on the side of the highway after the murder, it was so clear that the murder was not done for some reason like looting, but because of enmity
 yani kaatil jo bhi tha abhishek kaa dushman tha
 The police now get Abhishek's call details to look into the enemies
 shaq ye bhi tha ki shaayad kaarobaari ranjish kii vajah se kisi ne abhishek ko maut ke ghat utaar diya ho
 In this attempt, when the police started to investigate the call details, then by going to a number, he got his eyesight
 ye wo number tha, jis par abhishek kii naa sirf sabase zyada baar baatcheet hoti thi, balki katl se pehle yani 19 disambar ko bhi aakhri baar abhishek ne isi number par phone kiya tha
 But this number was neither of any businessman nor of any of Abhishek's family
 balki number prerana naam kii ek ladki kaa tha
 Since Prerna had spoken to Abhishek for the last time before her death, the police reached directly to Prerna
 poochtacha ke dauraan prerana abhishek ko acchhee tarah jaanane kii baat, to maanati he, lekin katl ke bare main koi khaas jaankaree nahin detii
 Police investigation continues
 isi dauraan pataa chalata he ki prerana kii abhishek gupta se naa sirf vakphiyat thi, balki donon ek-duusare ke behad kareeb bhi the
 The police also learn that Abhishek often used to pay money to Prerna as well
 in tamaam jaankaree ke baad bhi police katl yaa katl ke makasad tak ab bhi nahin pahunch paa rahi thi
 However, the eyes of the police were still on the motivation and due to this fine eye, suddenly the police comes to know such a thing which gives both the whole case a new twist and purpose
 beshak abhishek or prerana ek-dasre ke behad najadik the, lekin prerana kaa ek or bwyfriend bhi tha
 Amit, so what is the matter of love triangle? Or is there something else at the root of the plot? And if Prerna is a murderer, then why did Abhishek call her before the murder? There were now three characters in the story in front of the police
 ek khud abhishek, duusari prerana or teesraa amit
 The entire story was around these three characters
 lihaaja police ne ab amit or prerana kii janmkundali nikaalani shuru kar di
 The story that came after Taftish was something like this
 abhishek or prerana ke bich puraane sambandh the
 Abhishek often spent his evening with her in Prerna's flat
 wo prerana kii har farmaaish puri karata or use aksar paise bhi diya karata tha
 Meanwhile, Amit came into Prerna's life, the closeness between the two also increased
 phir vakt bitne ke saath amit ko abhishek ke bare main pataa chal gaya
 On the other hand, after coming to Amit's life, Prerna also wanted to get rid of Abhishek
 magar abhishek har shaam sharaab ke nashe main prerana ke flats me pahunch jaataa
 So to get rid of Abhishek, Prerna and Amit decide to remove him from the path
 ye abhishek kii jindagika aakhri din tha
 Like frequent visits, on this day, Abhishek was going to come to his flat to meet Prerna
 magar amit or prerana ne pehle hi thaan liya tha agar aaj abhishek ne uske flats main aane kii galati kii, to yahi uski jindagi kaa aakiri din hoga
 As soon as evening was over, Drunk Abhishek went to Prerna's flat
 uske aate hi pehle se flats main ghaat lagaae baithe amit ne abhishek ke sir par ek joardaar waar kiya
 Abhishek panicked and collapsed on the ground due to this sudden attack
 iske baad amit or prerana ne mil kar amit par tabadatod itane hamale kiye ki uski jaan chali gai
 As both of them had already made preparations for Abhishek's whereabouts, they lost the time without first filling Abhishek's corpse in a suitcase and then leaving the house in the dark of night to find him
 rahi baat gaayabahone se pehle abhishek ne aakhri kol prerana ko hi kyon kiya? to iskaa jawaab ye tha ki flats me aane se pehle wo prerana se pataa kar rahaa tha ki wo flats main he yaa nahin
 According to the police, Abhishek and Prerna's relationship was so secret that it would have been difficult to reach Prerna even if there were no call details
 varsh 2012 ke gujarat vidhansabha chunaav main bhaajapa ne mukhyamantri narendra modi ke anwarat chunaav prachaar kii vajah se jab 115 siten jeetin thim tab unke pratidwandi or congress ke netaa shankar singh waghela ne apane ek mitra se daawey ke saath kaha tha, ''bhaajapa ne 115 siten sirf is vajah se jeetin kyonki 2007 ke chunaav ke baad gujarat vidhansabha kii 182 siton kaa parisemen kiya gaya, jisamen gramin siton kii keemat par shahari siton main badhotaree kii gai
 If the seats were in 2007, then the BJP would not have managed to win 105 seats
 us sthiti main bhaajapa or congress ke bich kaante kaa muqabla hota
 "vaghela's comment was not far from reality
 udhaaharan ke liye uttari gujarat ke gramin ilaakon main jahaan 2012 main modi kii reliyon ke dauraan baari-bharkam bheed jamaa hui thi vahaan party ne behatar pradarshan nahin kiya
 In the district panchayat elections held in Gujarat nearly two years ago in December, the Congress defeated the BJP in 23 out of 31 seats
 taluk chunaav main bhi bhaajapa ke mukaable congress ko acchhee khaasi siten milin
 The results of both these elections confirm Vaghela's talk about rural Gujarat
 is jeet ko bhaajapa ke liye chunauti or congress ke liye gujarat main vaapasi ke maukey ke taur par dekha ja rahaa he
 The defeat in both local elections clearly means that the villages of Gujarat, which are fueled by anger, are now boiling
 bhaajapa ko gramin gujarat main apni darakati jameen kaa andaja lag chukaa he isiilie vah ruthe graminon ko manaane main jute gai he
 BJP took out Narmada Yatra in more than ten thousand villages
 lekin mahilaayein, kisaan or majdoor isse kinaaraa kar gaye tathaa gaanvon main jagah-jagah is yatra kaa virodh bhi hua
 In another attempt to woo rural Gujarat, the BJP took out the "gujarat Gaurav" Yatra covering 149 assembly seats in rural and towns here
 lekin yah yatra bhi kuch khaas asar nahin dikhaa pai, jabaki ise asardaar banane ke liye kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh, videsh mantri sushamaa swaraj, soochna evam prasaaran mantri smriti irani or upi ke mukhyamantri yogi adityanath ko iskaa mukhya hissaa banaaya gaya
 Another attempt was made directly by BJP national president Amit Shah by organizing a town hall program in Ahmedabad
 isamen ahmedabad ke alaava sau se adhik jagahon ke sava lakh yuvakon ko dit takanic se live joda gaya
 But in the midst of these efforts, it is clear that the bjp's state leadership, which has been ruling the state for 22 years and claiming to have transformed the state, is unable to dare to communicate directly with rural Gujarat
 is kaam ke liye bhaajapa patel andolan kaa netritv kar rahe hardik patel ke puraane saathi varun patel or reshma patel jaise logon ko apane saath jodgaye kii jugat main he
 However, the "cash scandal" of one million with Narendra Patel has also given a push to this attempt of BJP
 sattashin bhaajapa sarkaar ne votaron ko lubhaane ke liye 18 board nigam main chayarmen or nideshkon kii niyukti kii, anganwari, ashavarkaron kaa vetan 50 fisadi badha diya, petrol-dijal kii keemat 3 se 4 rupye gata die
 The government also announced to make permanent teachers teaching on fix pay
 kisaanon se kapaas or moongfalee nunatam samarthan mulya (emspi) par kharidne kii ghoshnaa diwali se pehle hi kii ja chuki he
 The public opinion in the local elections was clearly visible and seeing this, it is predicted that these results will have an impact in the assembly elections
 yah kayaas jahaan congress ko ummid de rahaa he, vahiin bhaajapa ke liye chintaa kaa sabab he
 With this hope, the Congress has started exploring its political land in Gujarat
 uski is ummid ko obisi kshatriya netaa alpesh thakor ke party main shaamil hone or hardik ke samarthan ne or majboot kiya
 On the other hand, Jignesh Mevani's opposition to BJP is another auspicious sign for the Congress
 congress is baar bade paimaane par yuva patidaar or obisi chehron ko tikat dene vaali he
 The Congress has decided to re-brainstorm its list of hundred candidates
 gramin kshetron kii naaraazgi to badi chunauti he hi, saath hi pichhali baar ke mukaable is baar ke chunaavon main bhaajapa ke zyada kamjor dikhne kii do or ahm vajahen hai
 First, the anti-incumbency trend being in power for two decades and second, Modi's absence in Gandhinagar
 haalanki party ke paas piem ke taur par modi kaa karishma maujuud he, baavjood iske satta par chadhaai kii bhaajapa kii dagar kathin he
 Young trio Jignesh Mevani, Hardik Patel and Alpesh Thakor also remain a challenge for the BJP
 gramin prishthbhumi ke in yuva netaaon kii pakad jitani shaharon main majboot he utani hi gaanvon main bhi
 a large number of Patel youths in central Gujarat, north Gujarat and Saurashtra are with youth leader Hardik Patel
 hardik aarakshan ke liye andolan chalaa rahe hardik bhaajapa ko haraane ke liye congress ke saath ek spasht gathbandhan bana rahe hai
 In many places in Saurashtra, more people attended Hardik's meetings than BJP state president Jitu Vaghani's Gujarat Gaurav Yatra
 udhaaharan ke liye, rajkot jile main upaleta kasbe main gujarat gaurav yatra kaa swaagat keval 800 logon ne kiya jabaki usee jagah par hardik kii sabha main 4,000 log jute
 Hardik is well aware that he is very popular among the public
 unhone bebaaki se apni raay rakhte hue kaha, ''gramin janata kaa rukh bhaajapa ke khilaaf he
 She has come to know the truth of the bjp's deceitful Gujarat model
 in chunaavon main gaanvvasi ekajute hokar bhaajapa ke khilaaf apana faisla sunaayenge
 "it is not that this is only the opinion of Hardik
 is baat kii tasdik gramin kshetron main hone vaali unki reliyon main juty bheed bhi kar rahi he
 The other big leader of this trio is OBC Kshatriya youth leader Alpesh
 ve sharaab virdohi andolan chalaakar apane samudaay ke netaa bane the or beete maheene congress main shaamil hone ke pehle sabhi obisi samoohon ke netaa ke taur par khud ko sthapit karne kii jugat main the
 Alpesh's anti-liquor movement was in the news in the outskirts of the city and especially in the villages
 aise main maujuuda samay main thakor logon ke bich behad lokapriy cheharaa hai
 Jignesh, the young Dalit leader, is the third major challenge
 jignesh us varg ke netaa hai jo gaanvon main sabase haashie par to padaa hi he saath hi shaharon main bhi uski sthiti thik nahin
 The way Jignesh played a role in the Una movement, he emerged as the leader of the Dalits
 or logon ne bhi unhen jis tarah se hathohath liya usase kahin na kahin andaja hota he ki is samudaay ko ek netaa kii jarurat thi
 Jignesh filled this void
 haal hi main gujarat main ek or ghatana saamne ai jisamen ek dalit yuvak ko garba main shamil hone par kuch logon ne peet-petakar maar daalaa
 Another similar incident occurred in Limbodara village of Gandhinagar
 isamen ek dalit yuva ko kathith taur par berahami se isliye peeta gaaya kyonki usne moonch rakhi thi
 These incidents are common in villages, but such incidents are also coming out in cities
 aise main jignesh kii lokapriyata lagaataar bad rahi he
 Jignesh is a leader not only of Dalits but also of tribals
 adivaasiyon ko forest act ke tahat jameen dene main asafal rahi bhaajapa ko expoj karne kaa abhiyaan chhedakar unhone is samudaay main bhi apni paith bana lee he
 He gave a clear message by joining his organization Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch and Adivasi Kisan Sangharsh Morcha that he is the leader of both these communities
 gujarat main ubhare is yuva netritv kii chunauti kaa andaja sattashin dal ko he
 That is why the BJP is focusing heavily on Patidars, obcs and tribal voters in Saurashtra, Kutch and North Gujarat
 vah in teenon netaaon se jude samudaay ko saadhane kii koshish main saaf dikh rahi he
 The number of urban and semi-urban seats in Gujarat with 182 seats is 72
 in jagahon par bhaajapa majboot sthiti main he
 But in the 110 assembly seats in rural areas, the bjp's hitherto united voters have been fractured by the trio of Alpesh, Jignesh and Hardik Patel
 bhaajapa philhal is koshish main he ki gramin ilaake main uskaa vot bank nahin toote, yadi kisi vajah se inhen tuutane se nahin bachaaya ja sake to kam se kam votaron ko congress kii taraf ekajute hone se to roka hi jaae
 The bjp's strategy is stating that the party is in a defensive position
 haalanki bhaajapa mahasachiv or gujarat ke prabharee bhupendra yadav kehete hai, ''party 150 seat jeetegi
 The anti-incumbency trend is nowhere in the entire state
 congress kaa sanghathan kahin khadaa nahin dikh rahaa he or andruni ladaai charam par he
 "however, one of the BJP sources rejects Bhupendra's claims
 sutara ke mutabik, party kii asli chunauti tikat bantwaare ke baad saamne aegi
 The supporters of those whose tickets will be cut will sit home disappointed
 lekin jab modi the tab tikat katane ke baad bhi vidhayak yaa unke samarthak niraash nahin hote the, balki modi ke naam par sab ekajute rahete the
 Along with this trio, the anger arising due to the imposition of GST in the chaos on small traders, artisans and artisans of rural areas has further strengthened the picture for BJP
 kisaanon kii aatmahatya, karjamaafee or tisapar par notebandi jaise muddon ne is tasviir ko or bhi bhayaavah bana diya he
 However, the recent relief given to small traders and artisans in the GST has slightly improved the situation for the ruling party
 haalanki abhi bhi bhaajapa ne gramin gujarat main sab kuch nahin khoyaa he
 The Congress has traditionally faced the challenge of keeping its opposing castes — Patels and OBC Kshatriyas
 darasal patel paaramparik rup se anti-congress jati he
 Not only this, Patel and OBC Kshatriya are politically opposed to each other in rural areas
 aise main obisi kshatriya samudaay bhaajapa ke paksh main ja saktaa he
 According to political analyst Vidyut Thakkar, "patel's opposition to the BJP in rural areas will automatically unite the OBC community in the opposite direction
" aaj bhi patel banaam obisi kaa jhagada yahaan chalata he
 "after this there is a Koli Factor in Saurashtra which can work in favor of BJP as the most popular leader of this community is Purushottam Solanki of BJP
 lekin yahaan party ke paksh main jo sabase bada factor he, vah yah ki saamaanya taur par prabhaavshaalee patel samudaay kaa obisi ke log virodh karte hai
 If Patel community openly opposes BJP then both these communities can go with BJP
 haalanki ye donon samudaay tabhi ekajute hote hai jab hindutv kaa mudda haaavee ho, lekin is baar aisa nahin he
 However, the image of Narendra Modi, established as "gujarat pride", is still strong
 ganvo main bhi yah chhavi barkaraar he
 If Modi is able to take advantage of this image in these elections and if he manages to keep the referendum around himself, aiming for 2019 elections, then BJP can win the election
 bhaajapa kii prachaar ranneeti bhi is baat kii tasdik karti he ki vah modi kii isi chhavi kaa phayda uthaanaa chaahati he
 This is the reason that with the knock of elections, Modi's movement in the state increased
 bhaajapa ne aage bhi modi kii 50 se adhik reliyaan karne kii yojana banaai he
 Obviously, there will be a lot of people attending Modi's rallies
 agar modi kaa jaadu chalaa to nattejey unke paksh main aa sakate hai
 Apart from this, the service bridge scheme of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani can also impact
 puri tarah se ''good gavarnence" kii yah yojana pehali baar tehsil str par das gaanvon ko lekar shuru kii gai (ek tehsil main 40 se 70 gaanv ho sakate hai)
 This new novel concept brought in as a sub-tehsil can also go in favor of BJP in rural areas
 pichley ek saal main is yojana ke teen charan ke tahat sarkaar ab tak ek karod logon ko cover kar chuki he
 This figure is about one-sixth of the state's population
 bhaajapa gramin kshetron ke mukaable shahari kshetra main majboot sthiti main he lekin desh main sarvaadhik shahari aabaadi hone ke baavjood gujarat main 57 fisadi aabaadi ab bhi gaanv main rahati he
 This population is the reason for bjp's problems
 2012 ke chunaav main shahari or gramin kshetron main kamobesh baraabar pradershan karne vaali bhaajapa is baar agar graminon ko lubhaa paaegi tabhi ise gujarat kii satta milegi

 The Sydney Test match is always special in the cricket calendar for the last 10 years
 vaise to test cricket safed kapadon main khelaa jaataa he, lekin is din puure khel par gulabi rang chaaya rahata he
 The story behind this is also special
 australia ke purv tej gendbaaz glan maikgra kii shaadi jine se hui
 In 1997, both of them found out that Jane mcgrath had breast cancer
 donon ne is beemaari se haar maanane kii bajaay cancer se aisi ladaai ladane kaa man banaaya jo dusron ke liye ek sabak bane
 Both founded the mcgrath Foundation, whose work was to spread awareness about breast cancer among people
 22 june 2008 ko cancer se ladate ladate jine maikgra kii maut ho gai, magar glan maikgra ne is beemaari ke khilaaf apni ladaai barkaraar rakhi he
 The Sydney Test match was then named after the mcgrath Foundation
 is match ke dauraan darshak puure test match ke dauraan pink yani gulabi rang ke kapade pahan kar aate hai
 Not only this, the Australian cricket team also become a part of this campaign by wearing a pink baggy hat, sometimes wearing a pink sleeved bandage, sometimes keeping the grip of their bat pink in color
 paanch dinon ke dauraan log maikgra foundation ko khul kar daan dete hai, jisase breast cancer ke khilaaf jang ladane main madad hoti he
 This is a great example of how cricket is connected to a particular cause
 sidney pink test australia main breast cancer se ladaai kaa ek behtareen zariyaa ban gaya he or khel kii madad se log is beemaari se ladane ek saath ho gaye hai
 Sadly, there was no attempt to do this in India

 Sources are quoting that Nitish will not withdraw his resignation
 somvaar ko jediu vidhayak dal unke is faisle par muhar laga degaa
 On the other hand, party president Sharad Yadav has also made it clear that Nitish ji's decision is the final decision
 ise badla nahin jayega
 This decision was very difficult but justified
 gauratlab he ki loksabhaa chunaav main party ke kharaab pradarshan kii naitik jimmedaari lete hue shanivaar ko nitish ne bihar ke mukhyamantri pad se istipha de diya tha, jise bihar ke rajyapal divai patil ne manjuur bhi kar liya he
 However, Nitish recommended not to dissolve the assembly
 aapako bataa den ki 2009 main 20 siten jeetne vaali jediu is baar modi lahar main dher ho gai
 The party could win only 2 seats
 aaj phir hogi jediu vidhayak dal kii baithknithish ke istife ke baad vidhayak dal kaa nayaa netaa chunane ke liye ravivaar ko jediu kii baithak hui

 Who will be the next Chief Minister of Bihar? After Nitish's decision is approved, who will be the next Chief Minister of Bihar, the party people have kept silence on this
 haalanki, sutron ne bataaya he ki vashishtha narayan singh, vijendra yadav or vijay kumaar choudhary ke naam ko lekar charchaa ho rahi he
 However, today the name of Rajya Sabha MP Ali Anwar and Bihar's Minister for Minority Affairs Shahid Ali Khan also joined the race of CM
 nitish par bijepi kaa hamalaudhar, bijepi netaa nitish kumaar par hamalaa karne se nahin chook rahe

 The matter is that on the lines of Gujarat, the Khadi policy will also be applicable in Uttar Pradesh
 elahabaad pahunche upi sarkaar ke khaadi evam gramodyog mantri satyadev pachori ne kaha ki pradesh sarkaar jald hi khaadi kii niti taiyaar karegi

 unka daawa he ki isse aane vaale dinon main upi or khaadi donon kii tasviir badal jaaegi
 Uttar Pradesh Khadi and Village Industries Minister Satyadev Pachauri said that Adityanath government of the state will implement Khadi policy in the state
 abhi tak desh main sirf gujarat main hi is tarah kii niti lagu he
 The Minister of Khadi and Village Industries has said that the State Government is constantly engaged in promoting Khadi with the theme of Khadi for Nation and Khadi for Fashion
 unhone kaha he ki khaadi mishan ko badhaava dene ke liye puraane parmparik charakhon ke saath hi ab solar charakhon ko bhi badhaava diya jaayegaa
 Khadi is becoming increasingly popular in the country as well as abroad
 unhone arse se band kambal kaarkaana ko phir se shuru karne ke baad kaha ki prastaavit khaadi niti kaa puraa masauda taiyaar ho chukaa he or april 2018 main ise lagu karne kii yojana he
 Pachauri said that so far the government gives a subsidy of 10 percent on making Khadi products
 nayi niti main sarkaar 10 kii jagah 15 pratishat kii sabsidi degi
 Now the tricolor flag from Khadi will also be made in Bhadohi
 unhone bataaya ki pradesh main band pade kul saat kambal kaarkaanon ko bahut jald phir kholaa jayega
 It is being started by opening a blanket factory closed at Bhadohi

 com / x7bsinorhl— ANI (@ani_news)march 14, 2016 Three years ago today, when the BJP stood at the cusp of generational change, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat remarked, “BJP will stand up from the ashes
 ” is bayaan par bavaal machaa to unki safai bhi kaabile gaur thi, “maine kaha tha ki bijepi raakh se uthakar khadi hogi, raakh nahin hui he
 If it is, then it will also stand there
 ”bhagwat kaa yah vaktavy or us par unka hi spashtikaran bijepi par apni majboot pakad banane ke liye bane khaake ke anuroop hi tha
 He made it even more clear when, after rejecting four veterans (D-4) Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu and Anant Kumar, who were never elected in Delhi, made Nitin Gadkari of his own Vidarbha region president 
 ab ek baar phir bijepi andruni jhanjhaavat jhel rahi he or sangh khud pasopesh main he ki vah lagaataar do aam chunaavon main haar jhel chuki bijepi kii satta main aane kii sambhaavna badaye yaa phir sanghathan par apana kabja barkaraar rakhe
 The RSS and the government were left independent after Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government was formed
 lekin bhagwat sangh ke is prayog ko nahin doharaana chaahate, isliye dilli main baithe tamaam suramaaon ko darkinar kar gadakari par daanv laga chuke sangh ne unhen doosraa kaarykaal dene kii koshish kii he
 Sarkaryavah Suresh Joshi aka Bhaiyyaji, who holds the number two position in the Sangh, does not appear to be against giving him a second term despite all the allegations against Gadkari (read conversation with Suresh Joshi aka Bhaiyyaji)
 aaropon ke maddenjar gadakari ko bhi kasuti par kyon na ksaa jaae? is sawaal par joshi kehete hai, “jarur ksaa jaae, par mujhe lagata he ki us kasuti par ve khare utarane kii koshish karenge
 However, he bluntly denies any role of the Sangh in the decision in the name of Gadkari for the Speaker
 lekin bhagwat ke liye gadakari turup kaa patta hai, jinke jariye ve sanghathan par pakad banaae rakh sakate hai
 The dilemma of the RSS is about the leadership of the government in 2014
 uske akhil bhartiya kaaryakari mandal ke ek sadsy bataate hai, “parivaar ke bheetar kii charchaaon main yah spasht ho chukaa he ki narendra modi ke sivaa koi doosraa cheharaa nahin he, jisamen party ko 2014 main satta tak pahunchane kii kshamta ho
 By bringing in Modi, the alliance also seems to be strengthening and the demolished Hindu vote bank can be united
 ”lekin sangh kaa asamanjas is baat par he ki kya vah aisi sarkaar chahega, jisamen uskaa koi dakhal na ho? is uhapoh main fansaa sangh brands modi ko puri tarah se khaarij bhi nahin kar rahaa
 a confidant of Bhagwat says, "eight states have elections yet, why should we open our cards from now on?" The fear of Sangh leaders is from Modi's Gujarat model, where the organization has dwarfed ahead of them
 in netaaon kii daleel he ki agar modi ko ek baar project kar diya gaya to sarkaar bane yaa na bane, ve duusari peedi ke netaaon main sheershasth ke taur par sthapit ho jaaenge
 In such a situation neither Modi would like to give up his occupation, nor could the RSS ignore him
 sutron ke mutabik, modi kii raah main ab nitish kumaar se badi aadchan sangh parivaar kaa uhapoh he, kyonki bhagwat kii kor team modi ke khilaaf maani jaati he
 Modi only has the support of Sah Sarkaryavah Suresh Soni, Dattatreya Hosabale and Madan Das Devi
 devi swasthya kaarnon se philhal sakriy nahin hai, to soni ko kinare kar bijepi se samanvay kii jimmedaari bhagwat ke vishwast sah sarkarywah gopal krishna ko dene kii atakalein lagaataar lagati rahati hai
 According to sources, Gopal Krishna and K
 si
 Bhagwat had made Kannan two new posts a year ago to co-govern so that the opposite opinion would not be affected by his decisions
 gaur talab he ki bhagwat ke sarasanghachaalak banane par soni kaa sarkarywah bananaa tay tha, lekin bhagwat ne bhaiyyaji ko is pad ke liye chunaa
 National President Gadkari has definitely emerged as a strong tool for the purpose of the BJP coming fully into the hands of the second generation and implementing the Sangh's plan
 jinhone apane dhai saal ke kaarykaal main sangh kii ummiido ke mutabik di-4 par na sirf badhat hasil kii he, balki kai ahm faislon main unki raay darkinar karne main bhi hichak nahin dikhaai
 Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Gadkari's political adviser and director of the Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini Sabha, says, "gadkari is the source of traditional energy in traditional politics
 ”yah aresas par gadakari kaa atoot bharosa hi he ki bijepi kii ore se adhyaksh pad ke liye jetali, rajnath singh, swaraj kaa naam aage badaye jane par aresas ne sabhi naamon ko khaarij kar gadakari par hi bharosa jataayaa
 The Sangh's effort is that Gadkari should remain the president and the Prime Ministerial candidate should be decided later, so that if the situation of the government is formed after the elections, then through them the Sangh can run its own will
 disambar main ‘agenda ajtak’ kaarykram main gadakari ne bhi sangh kii soch kuch yon saamne rakhi thi, “main party adhyaksh ke naate puure adhikaar or bharose ke saath kahata hum ki chunaavon se pehle ham kisi ko bhi project nahin karenge or sirf sahi vakt aane par hi pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar ke naam kaa elaan karenge
 “it is clear that the RSS wants to capture the organization in any way and also decide the future of the government
 bijepi ke bare main bhagwat kaa mat yahi bataaya jaataa he ki party main sudhaar se hi sangh kii chhavi judi he
 Therefore, this is the first time for the Sangh since the atal-advani era when it can hold its own over the party and for this Gadkari is their most trusted warlord
 unki company ‘purti’ par jab gadbaditon ke aarope lage, to bhagwat ne apane kareebi or peshey se chartered acountint es
 Through an investigation through Gurumurthy, he tried to show Gadkari to be clean
 bijepi ko lekar sangh hameshaa uhapoh main rahaa he
 Govindacharya, a BJP think tank, says, “what happened last time (2009) is still in the shadows
 lekin sangh tabhi bijepi ke maamle main saamne aata he, jab party na soch paae
 Govindacharya considers Bhagwat's comments in 2009 to be more intrusive than the accusations against Gadkari and the Sangh's initiative in his favor through Gurumurthy
 lekin unka maananaa he ki vah hameshaa dakhlandaji nahin karata
 According to him, the Sangh's role in making Gadkari as president was limited to advice
 sangh-bijepi rishton kii mushkil yah he ki khule taur par ise kabool bhi nahin karata or naa hi bijepi ko khulaa chhodia chahta he
 Bhaiyyaji says that when the Jana Sangh was formed, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee sought help from the then RSS chief Guru Golwalkar
 jiske baad guruji ne kuch swayamsevak madad ke liye die
 However, he also says, "the Jana Sangh separated from the Janata Party only on the RSS issue, so there are some relations
" ” bijepi ke maamalon main aresas ke badhate dakhal kii vajah aadhuniktaa ke saath parivaar kaa dwandv or shakhaon main kam hoti upasthiti bhi he
 It is clear that as much as the Sangh is clear about the re-induction of Gadkari to the post of President, he is also skeptical about forming the government in 2014 and its leadership

 Why are the government's evaluations not slogans on the schemes or programs that change the center, but the slogans of crossing through a bad and bad neighbor (pakistan)?

 Ease on the foreign exchange front • Better growth rate in a reliable economy before the latest recession and most importantly after economic liberalization for the first time in the five largest economies i

 The election results of the states after 2017 not only reinforce this apprehension, but some other facts also confirm why a powerful government has to carry an air of emotion rather than its functioning

 Attack on elders continues in Delhi
 ek baar phir se ghar main maujuud akeli bujurg mahila ko luteron ne apana nishaanaa banaaya he
 The incident is in the Punjabi Bagh area of delhi
 yahaan par badmaashon ne ghar main maujuud ek bujurg mahila kii hatya kar lutpaat kii or faraar ho gaye
 The incident came to light on Wednesday evening
 police jab maukey par pahunchi to use mahila ke sir or sharir par gambhir chot ke nishaan mili
 The woman was alone at the time when the woman was killed
 is vaardaat main sabase zyada hairaan karne vaali baat yah he ki lutpaat or katl karne ke baad ek hatyare ne mahila ke bete ko phone kiya or use dhamkee di
 The murderer of the killer was so much that he also told the son about his mother's murder after the murder
 mrit mahila kaa naam saroj he
 Saroj, 65, lived in the Manohar Park area of punjabi Bagh
 din ke vakt saroj ghar par akeli hi rahati thim
 Saroj's husband has a dry fruit trade in Tilak Bazaar
 pati har subah ghar se nikal jate hai or shaam tak aate hai
 Saroj also has two sons, but both live separately
 is vajah se din ke vakt saroj akele hi rahati thi
 It seems from the manner of murder that the killers were aware that Saroj lives alone at home during the day
 yahi kaaran tha ki badmaashon ne hamale kaa vakt din hi chunaa
 In this case, when Aaj Tak asked the Delhi Police, the answer was found that why the murderer called Saroj's son and threatened him, it is not understood
 lekin isse itnaa to saaf ho gaya ki wo jo koi bhi he, use paariwarik sthiti kii puri tarah se jaankaree he
 Police is investigating this murder incident from every angle
 police parivaar se sambandhit har kisi ke mobile phone ko khangaal rahi he
 Together, the CCTV is also investigating all the surrounding areas before the incident

 Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has started taking suggestions from JDU mlas and mps to know the ground realities in the wake of the deadlock over the alliance with the RJD and the ongoing verbal war between the two parties ahead of a possible Bihar assembly election at the end of the year
 
 patna ke 7 sakurlar road sthit apane sarkari awaas par nitish ne bihar ke teen jilon pashchimi champaran, purvi champaran or bagaha ke jediu vidhayakon or saansadon sahit party ke anya netaaon se jamini hakeekat jaanane ke liye bhent kii
 JDU state spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said that Nitish will meet for such second meeting with mlas and mps from Madhubani, Darbhanga, Sitamarhi and Shivhar on Wednesday evening
 unhone bataaya ki baaki vidhansabha kshetron ke vidhayakon or sansadeey kshetron ke saansadon se nitish ji kii is mulaakaat kaa silsilaa 17 june tak jari rahegaa
 The corridor of power is being speculated that Nitish is meeting district-wise mlas, mps, party officials, and wants to know what will be the party's status by contesting elections alone without the rjd's support
 argedy or jediu ke bich gathbandhan ko lekar jari gatirodh ko samaapt karne ke liye lalu or nitish ek-duusare ke kareeb rahane ke baavjood unke bich haal main koi baithak nahin hui he

 When RJD vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh put a question mark over Nitish contesting the election under Nitish, senior Bihar minister Shyam Razak alleged that Singh was doing so at the behest of BJP
 rajak ne kaha, ‘netritv ko lekar donon dalon ke netaa aapas main baithkar nirnay lenge
 Reacting to Rajak's remarks, Raghuvansh appealed to Congress President Sonia Gandhi to intervene to form a non-bjp alliance in Bihar
 jediu ke pradesh adhyaksh vashishtha narayan singh ne spasht rup se kaha he ki nitish ke alaava kisi anya kaa netritv unhen sweekaarya nahin he
 Many other mlas and party leaders, including Madhuban MLA Shivji Rai in East Champaran district, have also agreed with his views

 Ramai, an eighth time MLA from Bochha assembly constituency in Muzaffarpur district, demanded the appointment of Deputy Chief Minister when Nitish became the Chief Minister for the fourth time in February and Water Resources Minister was responsible for overseeing relief operations in Raxaul in Nitish's recent earthquake
 Expressing his displeasure over being handed over to Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, he resigned from the post of minister in-charge of East Champaran district Was

 Kingfisher Airlines, which has been steadily dying since November 2011, was ready to be grounded in early July

 Although the employees went on strike on 14 July, the fifth strike in two months, the deadline airline survived

 bharat bhushan pad par bane nahin rah sake
 It was not even a week before the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet headed by the Prime Minister granted him extension as DGCA till November 30, 2012, on 10 July, he was abruptly removed
 9 july ko bhushan ne yah sifarish karte hue ek note likhaa tha ki kingfisher ko ek notice jari kiya jaae, jisamen unhen apane karmchaariyon or dendaaron ko bhugtan kii turant vyavastha karne ko kaha jaae
 It is further written in the note that even if the full payment is not made, at least a large portion should be paid
 unhone likhaa tha, ''is baat kaa sanket diya ja saktaa he ki yadi notice milane ke 15 din ke bheetar dhanrashi uplabdh nahin karai jaati he or dendariyon main acchhee-khaasi kami nahin laai jaati he, to ham unka kaamkaaj thap karne ke liye vivash ho sakate hai
 He also said that Kingfisher has not paid salaries to its employees since February 2012, which is a cause for concern
 unhone likhaa tha, ''(kingfisher ke) sanchaalan main vishesh suraksha kii andekhi jari he
 Many engineering issues have emerged during its audit, which have a direct impact on safety
 ''to kya bhushan ko isliye hataaya gaya tha ki kingfisher ko raahat di ja sake? naagarik uddyan mantri ajit singh kehete hai ki yah dharna galat he
 "we made it very clear in the beginning that the government would not give bailout to any private airline," he told India Today
 '' lekin mudda belout dene yaa ubaarane kaa nahin he
 The question raised by Bhushan was on passenger safety
 sutron ke anusaar bhushan ne suraksha kaa mudda kai baar uthaaya tha
 Financial and mental stress can have a direct impact on safety when the aircraft are maintained by engineers at 2 pm and pilots take off overnight
 mantri iskaa bahut zyada arth nahin nikaalte hai
 He says that there have been no (air) accidents in the country in the last six months
 ve kehete hai, ''jahaan tak payalton or ejiniyaron par tanaav kaa sawaal he, use aap kaise maap sakate hai? mujhe vishwaas he ki kingfisher kaa prabandhan antat unka bakaayaa chukaa degaa
 The opinions of analysts and aviation experts do not always match such optimism
 is bich kingfisher airlines kaa kahana he ki vah dijisie kii baarik nigaraanee ke tahat adhiktam sambhav suraksha ke saath kaam kar rahaa he
 When asked about the sudden removal of Bhushan, UB Group Vice President (corporate Communications) Ramprakash Mirpuri said that it was "extremely wrong and full of mischief that it has any connection with Kingfisher Airlines in any way"
 ''ajit singh or kaaryakari dijisie prashanth sukul jor dekar kehete hai ki 9 july kaa vivaadaaspad note tha hi nahin
 The disappearance of Bhushan's note is a shocking mystery as it means that it was torn from the records
 yah kanuunan aparaadh he
 Apart from this, many other things have to be denied by the ministry
 21 july ko indigo airlines ke pramotor rahul bhaatia ne daawa kiya ki ''sarkaar is udyog kii kuch chuninda companiyon kii khatir vimaanan nitiyon main faurbadal kar rahi he
 "we are a company with almost zero debt, and we have to compete with those who are getting help one after the other," he said
 ''kingfisher airlines kaa naam liye bina bhaatia ne kaha ki ve sarkaar ke swaamitv vaali air india se ''dikhaawati pratiyogita'' ke bare main jaanate the, lekin unhen ''aksham nijee operataron ko kaarobaar main banaae rakhane ke sarkaar ke athak prayaason'' par khed he
 He said that the government is promoting a company and this creates frustration
 bhushan ko hataane ke mudde par kisi airline kaa naam liye bina bhaatia ne kaha ki ''america main dijisie ke samakaksh fedral aviation administration hota he
 If a situation arises in which the crew of an airline has not been paid for months, be it pilots or technical staff, i guarantee they will shut down the airline on security grounds
 ''kingfisher airlines ko praathamikta die jate pakade jane par naagarik uddyan mantralay ko 25 july ko ek vistrut spashtikaran jari karnaa padaa tha, ''nijee operataron ko pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se koi vittiya sahaayta pradaan nahin kii ja rahi he balki unhen bazaar kii shaktiyon ke anusaar kaam karne kii anumati di gai he
 "it even stated that" there is no regulatory framework anywhere in the world that allows the license of an airline to be canceled only if it fails to pay the salaries of the employees
 ''ajit singh jor dekar kehete hai ki kingfisher kaa license radd karne kaa koi prastaav hi nahin tha
 The minister says, "if a scheduled airline has five aircraft in current condition and a fixed amount of equity, its license cannot be canceled unless there is a security issue
" ''lekin bhushan ne suraksha kaa hi mudda uthaaya tha
 Although the ministry does not see any relation between the poor financial condition of Kingfisher, non-payment of salaries and security, this is one of the main issues raised repeatedly by Bhushan
 23 march ko ek note main bhushan ne 20 march ko kingfisher ke maalik vijay maalya ke saath hui mulaakaat kaa zikr kiya he, jisamen maalya ne kathith taur par daawa diya tha ki ''kaaphi samay se bhugtan na kiye jane ke baavjood unke karmchaariyon ko koi shikaayat nahin he
 "but Bhushan has commented," After my interactions with various sections of airline employees, i believe that dissatisfaction among them is at its peak

 uttar pradesh ke mukhyamantri rahete vakt akhilesh yadav ke do sarkari bangalon ke khilaaf daayar yachika ko court ne khaarij kar diya he
 The court rejected the petition saying that now this petition has become ineffective
 court ne yachikakarta kii us maang ko thukraayaa jisamen unhone kaha tha ki hai court main yachika daakhil karne kii ijaajat di jaae
 In the last hearing, the Supreme Court had said that if the Chief Minister has two bungalows, then what is the harm in this? One for living in a bungalow and the other for government work
 mukhyamantri ke paas bahut kaam hote hai, bahut saare log milane aate hai iske liye agar daftar ke kaam ke liye doosraa bangala liya gaya he to kya galat he? is tarah to jajon ke paas bhi do hisse hote hai ek sachivalay or ek awaas haalanki supreme court ne kaha tha ki upi main chunaav hone hai isliye maamle kii sunwaayee chunaav ke baad april main karenge
 The comments darasal lok prahari sanghathan ne supreme court ne janhit yachika kii thi
 In the petition, Akhilesh was challenged to give five bungalows on Kalidas Marg and a government bungalow on four Vikramaditya Marg
 isse pehle november main lakhanu hoicourt ne mukhyamantri akhilesh yadav ko badi raahat dete hue court ne unhen doosraa bangala aavantit kiye jane ko chunauti dene vaali yachika khaarij kar di thi
 The bench had said that a bungalow already allotted by the Chief Minister is also being used as an office where many people would obviously come to meet
 aise main parivaar kii niztaa kaa hanan hota hoga
 Therefore, allocation of second bungalow is not a subject in which the court intervenes
 yachika main kaha gaya he ki mukhyamantri ko 5 kalidaas maarg ke alaava 4 vikramaditya maarg bangale kaa aavanton upi ministars (vetan, bhatte or prakeern upbandh) adhinium- 1981 se pare jaakar kiya janaa bataaya gaya
 SN Shukla had argued to the court that the amendment in the said Act this year has been done so that the bungalow remains with him even after the Chief Minister is relieved
 vahiin sarkaar kaa tark tha ki 1985 se hi pradesh main mukhyamantri ko do bangale aavantit kiye jane kii pratha chali aa rahi he
 The Chief Minister has a lot of work, a lot of people come to meet him, so if another bungalow has been taken for office work, what is wrong? In this way, the judges also have two parts, a secretariat and a residence, although the Supreme Court had said that elections are to be held in UP, so the matter will be heard in April after the election
 tippaniyan In fact, the Public Interest Litigation was filed by the Lok Prahari Sangathan by the Supreme Court
 yachika main akhilesh ko paanch kalidaas maarg ke bangale ke alaava chaar vikramaditya maarg par sarkari bangala dene ko chunauti di gai thi
 Earlier in November, the Lucknow High Court gave a major relief to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the court dismissed the petition challenging the allotment of a second bungalow to him
 bench ne kaha tha ki mukhyamantri dwaara pehle se aavantit ek bangale ko karyaalay ke taur par bhi istemaal kiya ja rahaa he, jahaan jaahir taur par bahut se log milane aate honge
 In such a situation the privacy of the family must have been violated
 lihaaja, duusare bangale kaa aavanton aisa vishay nahin, jisamen court hastkshep kare
 The petition said that besides the 5 Kalidas Marg, the Chief Minister was told to allot 4 Vikramaditya Marg bungalows beyond the UP Ministers (salary, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act - 1981
 esen shukla ne court ko tark diya tha ki ukt adhinium main isi saal sanshodhan karte hue yah aavanton isliye bhi kiya gaya he taaki mukhyamantri ke kaaryamukt hone ke baad bhi bangala unke paas bana rahe
 At the same time, the government argued that since 1985, the practice of allocating two bungalows to the Chief Minister is going on in the state

 Film Review: Dhoom 3 Artists: Amir Khan, Katrina Kaif, Abhishek Bachchan and Uday chopradirector: Vijaya Krishna Acharyabjat: Approximately Rs 100 Crore Star: 3 Dhoom is one of the films that set a strong ground for sequel films in Bollywood
 is siries kii har film ke saath bhavyata or acshan kii jabardast bahaar aati gai
 This time too, something similar has been done
 aamir khan or katrina caff ko sarprise package ke taur par istemaal kiya gaya he
 There is nothing special for Katrina Kaif to do in the film
 glamer ke taur par laayaa gaya he lekin istemaal nahin kiya gaya he
 The film is nothing short of a celebration for the typical Hindi cine lovers
 har baar kii tarah technology, gagetts, bikes or acshan is baar bhi hai
 All is high quality
 lekin kahani puri tarah bachakaani he
 How powerful Shroff runs the Great Indian Circus in the story
 vah kaaphi udhaar le lete hai or ve use chukaa nahin pate hai

 Alia (katrina Kaif) supports her in this
 bas har baar kii tarah jai (abhishek bachchan) or ali (udai chopra) choriyon ko rokane ke liye aa jate hai
 The explosion starts from here only
 haalanki kahani main kai loch hai
 Is a three- hour film
 jo baat nahin pachati he vah yah ki chicago police naakaam he or mubani police ko bulaayaa jaataa he or uske do police officer apane johar videsh main dikhaate hai
 Many such things that are not embraced

 There is no story in it
 thrill nahin he
 In terms of story, Aamir can be called one of the weakest films
 aamir khan negative kirdaar main nahin jamate hai
 The story is completely filled with flaws
 aamir khan ke saath kahin-kahin katrina kii jodi ankhon ko bahut acchhee nahin lagati he
 Katrina has done her best as she gets
 abhishek bachchan jai ke kirdaar main pehle jaise hi hai
 Uday plays the role of Ali and he makes a laugh in the film
 kamai kii batfilm kaa bajet 100 karod rupee se zyada he
 The tickets for the film range from 50 to 900 rupees
 banpar opening kii ummid he
 Marketing has been tremendous
 aise main film ke 200 karod rupee ke club main shaamil hone kii ummiden jataai ja rahi hai
 But the weak story produces many kinds of surprises but a big banner can handle the film
 yah kahana galat nahin hoga ki dhooma 3 apni pehali filmon kii apeksha unniis hi rahi he
