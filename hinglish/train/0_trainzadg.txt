 It is said that there is no age to dream of humans and fulfill them
 jo ye kehete hai, sach kehete hai
 We live our whole lives with a dream and the responsibility of fulfilling our dreams rests on your own shoulders
 doosraa aapaki madad kar saktaa he lekin unhen aapke liye sach nahin kar saktaa, ji nahin saktaa
 And no one can stop a person who is determined to fulfill his desire
 aisi hi sapane dekhne, dikhaane or phir unhen sach karne kii kahani he, upi ke bagpat ke johri gaanv kii shooter daadiyon, chandro or prakaashi tomars kii
 Brave people are those who have the courage to do something and set an example
 shooter daadiyon kii jindagi kii kahani bhi hamaare deshavaasiyon ke liye kisi misaal se kam nahin he or is par bani taapasi pannu or bhoomi pednekar kii film sand kii aankh se bada tribut donon ke liye shaayad hi kuch or ho saktaa he
 What is the story of the film? This is the story of Chandro and Prakashi Tomar, daughter-in-law of the Tomar family, who do household chores, cooking, serving her husband, plowing fields and working in a furnace in Johar village of Baghpat
 Apart from that, she could not do anything special
 unke pati din bhar hukka phunkate or badi-badi baaten karte hai
 After 60 years of life, Chandro and Prakashi suddenly find out about their shooting talent
 lekin shooter banane kaa sapana dekhne lagi in donon daadiyon ke saamne ek-do nahin balki hajaaron chunautiyaan hai
 The biggest of these is to take shooting training and even bigger is to go to the tournament and play
 jo auraten kabhi apane ghar se bina kisi mard ke baahar naa nikali hon, unhone kaise apane is sapane ko naa sirf puraa kiya balki baaki deshbhar kii mahilaon ko bhi kar dikhaane kii prerana kaise di yahi is film main dikhaaya gaya he
 You must have read the story of shooter Dadi in many newspapers, have seen many shows or news
 lekin taapasi pannu or bhoomi pednekar kii film sand kii aankh ke jariye aap in donon daadiyon kii kahani ko jite ho
 There are not many good things in this film
 lekin agar sabase upar kisi cheez ko rakhana ho to main actors kii parformens ko rakhuungi
 Good actors have been taken in this film and have been taken very thoughtfully
 ye baat aapako film kii shuruyaat main hi samaj main aa jaaegi
 In the role of Chandro Tomar, Bhoomi Pednekar and Prakashi Tomar in the role of Taapsee Pannu are less to be praised
 in donon hi actresses ne badhiya kaam karke dikhaaya he
 When both are together on the screen, you see their work, their mind is giving their shingles
 kai seen aise hai, jinamein donon kii acting duusare se behatar he
 But the biggest thing is that the chemistry of both of them is so amazing that both fit with each other
 bhoomi pednekar ko hamane bahut se desi avtaron main dekha he
 It is his specialty to play such a character and this time too he has done a tremendous job
 vahiin mujhe nahin lagata ki abhi tak koi aisa role bana he, jise taapasi pannu naa nibhaa paaen
 The supporting cast of the film is very solid
 prakaash jha, vineet kumaar singh, pawan chopra samet sabhi kaa actor kaa kaam badhiya he
 Whenever Prakash Jha comes on screen, every scene, frame makes everything his name
 diarector tushaar hiranandani ne is film ko bahut achche se banaaya he
 The film first binds you to the scene and then you go on with it
 isaki editing bahut crisp he or aapako ek bhi baar aisa nahin lagata he ki ye slo he yaa kahin apana point kho rahi he
 From the first scene to the last scene, you stay in your seat and live and feel the life of Prakashi and Chandro
 ye film alag-alag imotions se bhari hui he or ant tak aate-aate aapaki ankhon se aansu chhalak hi jate hai
 The background and the songs of the film are very good, on which your mind is sure to snort
 sirf ek cheez aapako khatak sakati he wo he taapasi or bhoomi kaa mechap
 Apart from this, you can easily ignore minor shortcomings
 to kul-milakar film sand kii aankh ko aapako jarur dekhnaa chahie kyonki ye phul paisa vasuul film he, jo aapako badhiya chijen sikhaati he
 We have seen Kareena Kapoor flirting with many Bollywood veterans on the big screen, but no one has seen Bebo on the small screen like this

 Kareena and Kapil will be seen performing on Pyaar Hua Ikarar Hua Song

 The film 'kill Dil' is directed by Shaad Ali
 shaad isse pehle 'saathiya', 'banty or bubbly' or 'jhum baraabar jhum' jaisi filmein bana chuke hai
 'jhoom Barabar Jhoom Dekh' viewers could not jog and i think even 'kill Dil' would not make the audience happy
 film kii kahani dev or tutu kii he (ranbir singh or ali), jo bhaiya ji ke do ahm khilaadi hai
 Bhaiya ji takes betel nuts to kill people, which leads to the end, Tutu and Dev
 yahaan bhaiya ji ke kirdaar main dikhenge govinda, jinaki kareeb 4 saal baad bade parde par vaapasi ho rahi he
 The turning point in the story comes when Dev is giving his heart to the direction, Parineeti and by forcing the hands of the heart, Dev makes up his mind not to kill people, but Bhaiyaji does not understand the matter of the heart
 'kil or dil' ke baaki khel ko jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 i think maybe Ranveer, Shad Ali and producers should have taken some break after Gunday
 is film kii sabase badi kami he, isaki kahani, jo ek line main hi khatm ho jaati he
 There is no newness in the story
 ek line kii kahani ko khinchaa gaya he, jiske kaaran film beasar lagi
 All of them know that Govinda is a good dancer and an amazing actor, but in 'kill Dil' i liked the character of Govinda
 darshak sochane par shaayad majaboor ho sakate hai ki inkaa kirdaar aakhir he kya or aisa kyon he? ranvir singh kii urja or abhinay main eemaandaaree film kii kai kamiyaan chhupaati hai
 Ali and Parineeti are just in the film and are fine
 jo acha laga vah he, film kaa sangeet, jiskaa shrey jaataa he, shankar ehsaan loy ke saath hi gulzaar sahab kii likhaawat ko
 His voice captures poetry, but regrettably it is not threaded into the film's story
 meri ummiido par 'kil dil' khari nahin utar pai
 Half and star with 2 stars, just for good music, ie 'kill Dil' 2 from me
 5 stars

 Anyway love always pradhanmantri narendra modi or america raashtrapati baraak obama ke vishesh 'man kii baat' radio program kaa mangalvaar ko global prasaaran kiya jayega
 It can be heard simultaneously in hundreds of countries of the world
 ol india radio kaa daawa he ki is vishesh radio program kaa torget audiens sirf bharat main 85 karod he
 So far, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been addressing the audience for an average of 20 minutes in the 'mann Ki Baat' program
 lekin obama ke saath 'man kii baat' program kaa vishesh prasaaran 35 minute lanbaa hoga
 Last week, the Prime Minister himself told the common people that the questions he would like to ask him and the US President Barack Obama in this program can be uploaded on the site mygov
 or ab tak bharat or america main rah rahe logon kii taraf se migav ke open forum par 7560 se zyaada sawaal yaa suzav rakhe ja chuke hai
 People have advocated increasing cooperation in sectors ranging from international terrorism to the economy and education
 ishwar bhai desai ne america raashtrapati obama se poocha he ki america kab tak pakistan ko ye ehsaas dilaane main kaamyaab hoga ki bharat ke khilaaf seemapar aatankwaad kii niti ko badhaava dene kii uski niti ke dushprinaam use bhi jhelane honge
 Whereas Srinidhi has asked that when no country is able to fight terrorism alone, why are different countries not taking the initiative to work together against it in a united manner to tackle international terrorism
 avanindra jadon ne obama se poocha he ki unhone apane desh main bhrashtachar se kaise nipta jabaki vishwaas taksaali naam ke shaks ne obama se poocha he ki kya america bharat ko sanyukt raashtra suraksha parishad kaa sadsy banane main puri madad karegaa
 Questions have also been raised on domestic issues
 rajan shukla ne piem modi se poocha he ki tex vyavastha main itani khamiyaan kyon hai or bhartiya nagarikon par kai saare tex kyon lagaae jate hai
 Sridhar Sethuraman has suggested to Modi and Obama that they have been living in the US for eight years and after the declaration of 'international Yoga Day', India and the United States should take initiative to further mutual cooperation to promote Yoga
 
 jabaki kamalesh kumaar ne suzav diya he ki donon deshon ko ye sunishchit karnaa chahie ki chaatr ek duusare ke yahaan jaakar aasaani se padhai kar saken
 
 
 Now it has to be seen how many such questions are answered by Prime Minister Modi and President Obama in the special 'mann Ki Baat' program at eight o'clock on Tuesday night
 jammu-kashmir ke pulavama main 40 javaanon kii jaan lene vaala jaish-e-mohammad kaa sargana moulana masood ajahar ab global aatanki ghoshit ho gaya he
 It was being tried by India for a long time, but now it was a diplomatic victory
 america, france or euke ke sanyukt prastaav or china ke apane vito waapas lene ke saath hi sanyukt raashtra kii suraksha parishad ne masood ajahar ko global aatanki ghoshit kiya
 After this decision, the neighboring country of Pakistan has once again gained its own applause
 is faisle ke saath hi vahaan kii sarkaar or media donon hi ise apni jeet bataane main jute gai hai or bharat par nishaanaa bhi saadh rahi hai
 The Foreign Ministry said that Pakistan, which saved Masood Azhar on its winning occasion, is not accepting un's decision as India's victory
 pakistani videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa mohammad faisal ne bhi is faisle ke baad kaha ki hamaari sarkaar puri tarah se pratibandhon ko lagu karegi
 He said that this case will be handled like other UN cases
 pravaktaa mohammad faisal bole ki iske tahat ham masood ke videsh travel par roak lagaayenge or unki sampatti bhi jabt karenge
 He said that terrorism is a big issue for the world, including the atrocities being committed by India in Kashmir
 unhone kaha ki ham is faisle par isse pehle virodh isliye kar rahe the kyonki iskaa raajnneetikaran kiya ja rahaa tha
 Let me tell you that Pakistan, which is reiterating its conditions on one side, is under pressure from the world since the airstrike in Balakot
 yahi kaaran he ki usne balakot airstrike ke baad se hi masood ajahar ko najarband kiya hua he
 The media is also seeing a unique approach; Apart from the government, the media there is also considering it as the victory of their country
 pakistani media buudhvaar se hi likh rahaa he ki sanyukt raashtra kii pabandi pakistan or china kii shart maanane kii vajah se lag pai he
 If Pakistan and China did not agree, then Masood Azhar could not be declared a global terrorist
 pakistani akhbaar Tribune PK ne likhaa he ki masood ajahar ko global aatanki to ghoshit kiya gaya, lekin kashmir ke masale par jo baat bharat manvaanaa chahta tha uski vah ichha puri nahin ho saki he
 Pakistan says that two of the issues on which it objected were to link the name of Masood Azhar with the incidents in Kashmir and the name of Pakistani institutions, which was changed and later china-pakistan agreed

 odisha main vidhansabha chunaav do saal baad hone hai, lekin bhartiya janata party ne rajya main chunavi jeet ke liye taiyaariyaan abhi se shuru kar di hai
 The two-day national executive meeting of the BJP has started here
 haal main hue sthaneey nikaay or panchayat chunaav main party ne acchhee safalataa hasil kii thi
 After this, the party has now put its emphasis on coming to the power of the state
 9 saal tak rajya kii satta main saajheedaar rahi he bijepi1998 main bhaajapa kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii yahaan baithak hui thi
 After this, the BJP joined hands with the Biju Janata Dal in the state
 1998 main centre main atal bihari vaajapeyi ke netritv main bani endie sarkaar main bijedy bhi shaamil hui thi
 Later, in Odisha too, BJD and BJP formed a government together
 phir donon ke bich matbhed ubhare or bijedy ne endie se naata tod liya
 Since then, the BJP has been pushing for its expansion in the state
 haalanki bijepi saal 2000 se nau saal tak bijedy sarkaar kaa hissaa rahi magar is dauraan bijepi vahaan apni jaden jamaane main naakaamayaab rahi, bijepi hameshaa ek sahyogi kii bhoomika main hi rahi
 Despite the Modi wave in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP could win only one seat in the state
 vaise to odisha ke vidhansabha chunaav saal 2019 main hone hai magar bijepi sthaneey chunaavon main kiye behatar pradarshan ko puri tarah bhunaanaa chaahati he
 BJP has performed well in the panchayat elections of Odisha
 bijepi jahaan 2012 ke panchayat chunaavon main 851 main se maatr 36 siten jeet sakane main kaamyaab rahi to 2017 ke chunaavon main wo 306 seat jeet kar ai
 What is also encouraging for the BJP is that the party has managed to make a dent in the Biju Janata Dal stronghold in the local body elections, and at the same time pushed the Congress to the third position
 vartmaan main odisha main bhartiya janata party kaa keval ek saansad he, jabaki party ke keval 10 vidhayak hai
 Amit Shah will come every month in the state
now when there are good results for the BJP in the present time from Odisha, the bjp's next goal is to do better in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections of Odisha
 iske liye party vishesh ranneeti par bhi kaam kar rahi he, jiske tahat amit shah agle chunaav tak har maheene kam se kam teen din rajya ke alag-alag hisson main bithaayenge
 Apart from this, some senior leaders including Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan will also be seen putting their full emphasis in Odisha till the next election, so that the BJP government in Odisha can come to power in the coming time

 beete saal ye satr 16 november se shuru hokar 16 disambar tak chalaa tha
 This time, due to the continuation of the electoral process in the two states, the government has kept silence over the winter session
 vahiin, vipaksh kii taraf se bhi satr ko lekar jis tarah kii sakriyata dikhaai jaani chahie, wo najar nahin aa rahi
 If sources are to be believed, the Modi government is thinking of starting the winter session of Parliament from the first week of December due to the Gujarat assembly elections

 The court had said that the constitution bench would hear the case in October

 The government had said that the rest of the newspapers were being printed and they were not printing intentionally

 Article 370 concludes that the President, by issuing orders, abolished Article 370, a provision giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir
 saath hi jammu-kashmir or ladakh ko do centre shasit pradeshon main baant diya gaya he
 The proposal to abolish Article 370 was passed by an overwhelming majority from both houses of Parliament and the President issued the order thereafter
 jammu-kashmir main anuchhed 370 samaapt hone ke baad suraksha ke lihaaj se ehtiyaat ke taur par kuch kadam uthaae gaye the The results of the Lok Sabha elections had confirmed the exit poll of India Today - Axis My India

 The results of Haryana were also almost right, although the final results were slightly reversed
 eczit pole main hamane bataaya tha ki bijepi chunaav main chhaayi rahegi or purv mukhyamantri bhupender singh hooda kii sonipat se haar tay he lekin hamane congress ko do seat di thim
 The Congress did not manage to win a single seat
 bijepi ne rajya kii sabhi 10 siten jeet leen or eczit pole nateezon ke behad kareeb rahe
 The exit poll of India Today Axis My India gave the Congress 8 to 9 seats in Punjab, 3-5 seats to the BJP Akali Alliance and 1 to the Aam Aadmi Party
 nateezon main akali bijepi ko 4 siten milin aap ko 1 seat or congress 8 siten jeetne main kaamyaab hui
 After all, why did the BJP win only 1 seat or the Akalidal lost 8 out of 10, then the answer is the anger of the people against the Akali government
 janata ne akali dal ko pichley chunaavon main nakaar diya tha jisane 10 saal tak punjab main raaj kiya
 BJP too had to bear the brunt of this alliance and Captain Amarinder did not allow the Modi wave to enter Punjab
 duusari vajah ye bhi ho sakati he ki punjab ke log pakistan se rishte bigaadane main dilchaspee nahin le rahe kyonki sikhon kaa dharmik sthal kartarpur vahaan he or kartarpur coridor kaa kaam tanaav ke chalate funs saktaa he
 In the same way, Aaj Tak My Axis India's exit poll about Himachal proved to be very accurate
 We had told that BJP will sweep all the seats by winning, whereas for Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat we had told that the contest will be tough
 bijepi ne himachal kii tamaam siten jitkar hamaare pole ko sahi sabit kiya, yahaan votaron ne rashtriya suraksha ke masale par vot diya kyonki himachal ke zyaadaatar gharon se fouj main shaamil hote hai
 However, in the exit poll, we managed to capture the mood of the public
 hamane kaha tha ki bijepi haryana main joardaar pradarshan karengi or hooda chunaav haarenge hua bhi aisa
 We had also said that in Punjab the BJP will be costlier with the Akalis

 *** Satire: The news of Pandey Ji and Lapkuram's Me Too - Elegance has come from Lalitjab that many people are starting to open shops under the Mi Two Campaign, so Lapkuram is also nervous
 kyonki javaani main badi bansuriyaan bajaai hai jisaki dhamak ab prasphutit hongi
 What news is coming from the media as well! At one time it seems that it will also be lost! Are all the men dirtying the society! Did the women not take any step to stop them? itnaa to koi pashu hi pashaviktaa kar saktaa he
 More than half of the married people intent on doing such abusive acts! Chillman said, Ustad Ji, i had already told you that even today, the mobile bill of Lapuram comes in thousands! jab dekho mand-mand muskaraata he, aise aadamiyon se bachanaa chahie
 Wicked tend to be, keep yourself from being rotten
 jahaan dekho munh maarthe dikhaai denge
 Oh! Such people! Where did they come from in this birth! It became difficult for people to live on earth
 radhelaal is maamle main chuppi saadhe he
 Pandey ji knows when to speak to him and he will be looking for an opportunity that when the time comes, he will speak! After all, this is democracy, Baba! Where people know when to straighten an owl and when to curl fingers
 abhi vishwa hindi sammelan main cargujariyaan thandi bhi nahin hui thim ki ab me tu kaa ronaa jagajaahir auki hansee udaata aa gaya he
 But there is no need for anyone to panic, in a few days this issue will go into cold storage and some other issue will come in its place
 vaise bhi ham bharatiyon kii smriti badi ksheen hoti he
 Often big issues are forgotten or forgotten
 tabhi asantusht kumaar ne kaha ki pandeya ji, namaskara
 Never drink tea with us too, Huzoor! Pandey ji felt that today he is more happy than necessary, thought if he is saying next, then he drinks
 baithe hi the ki kumaar sahab ne mobile par ek photo dikhalaai or kaha ki ye mere likhe naatak kii tasaveer he, pandeya ji ko badi hairaani hui ki aap naatak bhi likhte hai!badhai, bhai yah to hamen pataa hi nahin tha
 But disgruntled Kumar is one of those who creates literature quietly in his room
 kisi se kuch na kehete, bas apane kaam main hi lage rahete
 Such people are few on their earth, due to which the world is moving
 kahin se khabar ai ki man sabakaa phislaa he, dimag sabakaa khiskaa he
 In this affair, there are many people who do what is right, but if their family does it then it is wrong
 iske chalate unhone apane parivaar ko soshal media par aane ke liye manaa kiya he
 But in the supposed world, he kept blowing guzzlers, he had no qualms about this
 lapkuram ek jamaane main angreji ke gane guitar par bajaayaa karte the
 Many women were attracted to this affair
 ab aap ko baaten banane kaa hunar ho to kya kaali or kya gori sab kii line aapaki ore kendrit ho jaaegi
 In this case Lapkuram has been the creature of the infamous Kissim from the beginning
chilman chilman ne kaha ki mujhe samaj nahin aata ki logon ko mahilaon ke peeche daud kar miltaa kya he! lage hai daudane!vilayati ram pandeya ko vah din yaad aa gaya ki jab kisi kaam se ve raipur gaye the or desh ke bade kavi unke hotel main tehre the, ki tabhi kisi ne kisi sthaneey kavyitri se kah diya ki falaane kavi aayen hue hai, aapaki pratiksha kar rahe hai or udhar un kavi mahoday ko bhi aisa hi kuch kaha gaya
 What does Pandey see, that the so-called poet ji almost came running as if Dilip Kumar had almost run in the garden to meet a Madhubala, "dear lady! Do you love me so much even today!" What a great poet ran for me
 vaise kaviyon kaa kya mard prajati kaa mahilaon ke liye daudna abhi tak jari he
 Nowadays the affair of Me Too is almost like that everyone has to die
 beshak aapako sugar ho yaa na ho, yadi kisi lafde main na fanse to aapako mard jati par dhikkaar he, fanso bete, charchaa main aao or kuch naam kama jaao
 The rest are too many to see
 sahitya main aise bahut se kisse hai jo abhi lim lite main aane ko machal rahe hai
 Their agitation is also justified
 hamaara desh hi aise maahaul main pragati kar rahaa he ki jab hamaari ruchi nazaij sambandhon kii pragatishiltaa ko dekhne kii hoti he
 By the way! i am going to maiden, get the work done by the worker, often used to swim in sentences like this, now the wives have become careful to know which servant will entice me in the affair of Me Too and earn some immoral
 Get the source of aajkal kisi par koi bharosa nahin rahaa
 On the other hand, it has been reported that Bhabhi ji is at home that former heroine Shilpa Shinde has said that if there is a consensus between the two, then she will not come to the category of rape
 idhar ramkhelavan ne kaha ki kya jamaana aa gaya he, aniatik rishte! adharm kaa faltaa phulataa tantra!aise main koun kahan jaaen or kya kare!bharat kaa kya hoga!uski vaishvik chhavi kaa!pandeya ji ne kaha ki jab radhelaal or ramalubhaaya tak na sambhaal saken is chhavi ko to bete aap or ham kya cheez hai!chilman bhabhi ke paas jaao or muuli chhilava kar le aao, aaj muuli khaane kaa man he or thodaa saindha namak bhi le aana
 The gas comes open
 kehete hai ki bhitari safai bhi samay samay par ho jaani chahie
 Chilman said that the matter is correct
 vah daud kar chhili hui mulaayam muliyaan namak ke saath de gaya or kahin dur daud gaya
 He knew that when Pandey ji releases gas, his threat reaches two kilometers, Ramkhelavan did not know this
 us din jo ramkhelavan kaa haal hua, vah to hafte ke liye ghar se baahar niklaa nahin
 Even if someone asked, he started saying that it is not possible to leave due to Parli in UP
 lallu aaj aayaa nahin tha
 Pandey ji had forgotten that he had to go to a seminar today
 vaise bhi jisane jab koi kaam na karnaa ho or chhuttiyon kaa majaa lenaa ho vaise samay main seminar kaa bahaanaa ek sukhad prasang he, jise kabhi kabhaar aajamaane main koi harj bhi nahin
 Dayal Babu is cool
 pandeya ji ke saath chaay pi
 By the way, they have sugar, but they say where light sweet tea hurts! Madhubala said that all these old people are of the consummate species of Kissim
 Even the place is not available
 sab ne sahmati main sar hilaayaa
 Due to this and the discussion of the daily utility, the scholars are constantly discussing how much is still left for the topic! The contemplation has made the rest of the people conscious, they are constantly thinking how to make the topic more relevant
 So that the establishment of the subject can be arranged smoothly
 radhelaal ji ne ramalubhaaya se sampark kiya or ramalubhaaya kii sthapana ke samaksh sar jhukaaya
 Therefore, the person who is a scholar will also be considered to be recognized, the era will also respect him
 lapkuram ke dil kii dhadakanen badhati ja rahi he ki kahin kisi ne bhed khol diya to budhaape main jo izzat banaai he, vah to fokat dhul jaaegi or badanaami alag hogi
 On the other hand, Atu said that there will be no respect, then he is not the only man who baked his loaves on the pretext of Hindi conference
 aise aadmi to kisi kaam ke nahin, na sahitya ke liye bane hai, haan jugadu kah sakate ho, lekin bhai sahab ye jugad tantra kitne din or chalegaa!sab jaan gaye hai isaki hakeekat
 Now there is no delay in opening the shop
 attu ne kaha or doodh lene nikal gaya
 On the other hand, Pandey heard that he was surprised that what was said by Attu was right, but he did not expect that Attu would even be able to say the work
 lekin jo bheetar se bharaa ho bhai sahab vah jo kuch bhi kahegaa na, vah dil se kahegaa
 Now even the above people understood that this time they have made them mad, but not every time
 udhar jiskaa aalingan kiya tha, usne man bana liya ki lapkuram ke krity kaa locarpan kar diya jaae
 Booked the hall of the press club
 kuch channels vaale is samachar se hatprabh bhi the, jis mahila ko lapkuram har jagah liye dolate the, vahi aaj unka kaala chittha kholane ko betaab he
 When Khabarilal cursed, there was news from inside that Lapakuram had promised to take him to the World Hindi Conference and made a fat product in lieu of it
 dhanya hai lapkuram!dhanya he samaaj or dhanya he samaaj kii kureetiyaan or nitiyaan!kahan jayega hamaara hindustan or yahan kii gatividhiyaan
 However, Lapkuram has been reported missing at some unknown location
 press vaarta sthagit hui
 The woman was last seen with Lapkuram
 radhelaal ne kuch bhi kehane se inkaar kar diya
 Literature Society can tell what happened to this! Now the things which started coming up like this: Is Lapakuram a victim of any conspiracy? Is Lapakuram exploited that woman! Is there any other reason! The speculations are going on
 aage dekhte he ki kya math kar saamne aata hai
 Stay with us
 ham lete he ek camershal brake!pandeya ne kaha: aji, sunati ho, khaanaa bana do, aaj to samachar bhi man ke nahin rahe
 What time has come
 subah kapur sahab mil gaye kehane lage ki kone vaale minocha kaa kuch pataa laga!pandeya ji ne kaha nahin to!kya kebasi main aa rahe hai!are nahin!kal park saaf kiya, kha pi kar soye or bistar se ludhak gaye
 Attack came
 aspataal le jate lekin raste main hi chale gaye
 This is the best death, did not harass anyone
 pandeya ji ne kaha- jo likhaa he vah to hokar rahaa he, udhar me tu! yahaan atake!kitni vicitra paristhiti he!honi balavaan he or apane karmon kaa lekha jokha bhi to aapke saath chalata rahata he, usko na badalane kii aapke paas shakti he or na hamaare paas!lapkuraamon kaa me tu jari he
 Some have gone underground, but their context is not only anxious to get out of the mind like a rotten cheese bubble
 lapkuram kaa blad pressure badha hua he
 His Chellaram is very sad that if his secret is uncovered, then he too will be killed unhappily! After all, he too can be a companion of unhappiness and happiness! Pandey ji said Narayana Hari and went home
 asli sukh ghar main uski chaar deewari main he, ye baat sab jaan jaaen to me tu kaa chakkar hi khatm ho jaaen
 But Bhai Sahab does not want to taste the gourd of the house when dal butter is present in the market after several days of old tempering! What can you do too! essiai chairman captain anup sharma ne kaha ki durghatanasthal ke sameep ek anya jahaaj ne turant sabhi kru sadasyon ko bachaa liya

 Currently BSNL has about 1
5 lakh employees
 niti ayog kaa BSNL ko band karne kaa prastaav2016 main centre sarkaar ke think tanks maane jane vaale niti ayog ne BSNL ko ghate main chalane vaale psus se joda
 The commission also proposed to shut down the disastrous institution like BSNL to repair it
 pratispardhi jahaan 5G spectrum kii nilaamee kii ore dekh rahe hai
 At the same time, BSNL was also systematically excluded from going for 4G, as it would have cost the exchequer 14,000 crores
 karmchaariyon kaa kahana he ki privet players se BSNL kii tulana anuchit he
 Private players like Jio, Vodafone, Airtel adopt the outsourcing model for operation
 vahiin, BSNL ek PSU he jahaan karmchaaree purnakalik hai
 The institute has 20% towers' power supply disrupted by lack of funds
 karnataka or andhra pradesh jaise kuch rajya hai jahaan bijli kii aapurti ab bhi kii ja rahi he
 In West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, more than 500 BTS have come to a standstill
 ye maamla doorsanchaar vibhaag ke paas karj kii anumati ke liye atka padaa he
 The question is that if BSNL takes a loan, how will it repay it
 doorsanchaar vibhaag (dot) santhaan ko bainkon ke paas jane kii anumati nahin de rahaa, jahaan tak punaruddhar package kii baat chalane kaa sawaal he, to karmchaariyon ko intjaar he ki sarkaar PSU ke din pratidin ke kaamkaaj ko sucharu rakhane ke liye kya kadam uthaati he
 Now to see if it interferes with the PSU to revive it or send it back to the ICU

 Not because Gandhi was assassinated on this day, not because many people still go around believing this murder to be justified, not because we never repented deeply about Gandhi's death
 balki isliye ki hamaare bahut saare mohalle, shahar, pul, murtiyon, sangrahalay, skool, kalege or bazaar gandhi ke naam par bane hai
 For him, we can at least remember Gandhi, so that the relevance of Gandhinagar and Gandhi squares will remain
 ham gandhi ko bhale na jite hon magar unke bina ji bhi nahin pate
 Otherwise why is Gandhi's picture carved on the wall of Delhi Police Headquarters
 shaayad dur se hi diwaar par muskuraate gandhi ko dekhakar kisi kaa police ke prati vishwaas badal jaae or police kaa vyavhaar uske prati
 When was Gandhi not in the rooms of police stations and officers? times of india main sanyukt ayukta esake gautam ne kaha he ki gandhi kii yah tasviir dilli police ke naare 'shanti, seva or nyaay' ke saath match karti he
 However, without thinking how Gandhi was written the slogan of peace service and justice
 jo bhi ho mujhe dilli police kaa yah prayaas acha hi laga
 At least the police headquarters will not see the police
 kuch log gandhi ko din raat maarane main lage rahete hai or kuch hai ki din raat gandhi ko zindaa karte rahete hai
 Today, three young doctors of AIIMS came to meet me
 bataaya ki ames or iaiti ke kuch doctor ejeeniyar milakar garib chaatro ko koching mafia kii lut se bachaane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 In their small efforts, these boys have trained ten boys of ordinary family with mobile phones and made them doctors

 Radha writes that due to the fierce violence in Kokrajhar in Assam in August 2012, every section of the society became frightened of each other
 is ghatana ko lekar aaj bhi dilli kii press conferencon main congress−bijepi ho jaataa he
 When the team of Gandhians went there, in the atmosphere of fear and utter distrust of Kokrajhar, Gandhi soon became the support through which many communities could be brought closer

 bachche skool jane lage
 Schools and colleges were also organized to listen to Gandhi

 In many college schools and villages, on 2 October youth celebrated non-violence Day
 gandhi hinsa ke bich samaadhaan ban gaye hai
 Nowadays there is a debate about riots every other day
 kabhi is bahes main bolne vaale chehron ko chlose ap main dekhiyegaa
 No one will see regret on our face that we have failed as Congress BJP, but before that why we have failed as a society
 kisne kaha ki gandhi ko hi yaad kiijie
 After all, why do these parties who celebrate Gandhi Jayanti do not go on such occasions to reduce conflict with Gandhi and why do not you ask them these questions
 aise hi ek din mujhase milane sudhir kumaar tiwari aae
 It is said that his organization goes to the court of the town or district of the judges and places the statue of Gandhi, who has served faithfully

 At a time when the relevance of Gandhi idols is not considered less than a gimmick, someone has such deep faith in his idols
 aisa nahin he ki gandhi nahin hai
 Gandhi may not be seen in political parties and power establishments
 bijepi is baat ko lekar aakraamak he ki is baar congress samaapt kar dene ke sapane ko puraa kar dena he, par wo yah nahin bataate ki gandhi ne yah bhi kaha tha ki congress ko bhang kar lok sevak sangh banaaya jaae
 Are they going to do it, do they talk about it? duusari taraf congress he jo yah nahin bataati ki uski sarkaron ne gandhi ke aadarshon kaa kya kiya
 Gandhi has become a lump among the parties
 jise man karata ek gandhi uthaakar maar detaa he
 Sometimes Anna Hazare comes to Gandhi by becoming Part Two, then some Arvind Kejriwal writes a common man on Gandhi cap and claims to follow Gandhi's ways
 sabko lagata he ki gandhi matlab topi to sab tarah tarah kii topi lekar kaaryakarta netaa chale aate hai
 When it comes to taking power till the Mohalla Sabha, those who talk of giving rights to panchayats start calling it a gimmick
 gandhi ne kaha tha ki satta kaa vikendrikaran or aaj ke netaa kehete hai ki kam se kam gavarnence
 Everyone has Gandhi of kisses, not just Gandhi
 kya ham yaa hamaare raajnneetik dal eemaandaaree se yah baat sweekaar kar sakate hai ki gandhi ko puja to ja saktaa he, magar unke aadarshon par nahin chalaa ja saktaa he
 Can any party, after clearing all the ashes of its past, suddenly depart from afresh to walk on Gandhi

 vitt mantri arun jetali ne mangalvaar ko aarthik rup se kamjor saamaanya varg ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan ke samvidhan sanshodhan bill par bahes ke bich hastkshep karte hue is bill ko lekar congress kii aapattiyon ko khaarij kiya
 Arun Jaitley said that many times in the manifesto of opposition parties, reservation has been given to economically weaker section which was jumla
 jetali ne kaha ki saamaanya varg ko 10 fisadi aarakshan se supreme court dwaara aarakshan kii 50 fisadi seemaa kaa ulanghan nahin hota
 Jaitley said that Congress is saying that it is theoretically agreeable to this bill but there were many attempts for reservation for the poor of the general class, but their efforts were not in such a way that they could stay in the court
 jetali ne iske liye narsinghraav sarkaar dwaara jari kiye gaye notification va samay-samay par rajya sarkaron dwaara is hetu banaae gaye kanoonon kaa zikr karte hue ye baat kahi
 The Finance Minister said that the states either took out the notification or enacted a common law but what was the source of its authority
 sorce tha artical 15 or 16 lekin uske tahat saamaajik-shaikshanik pichhadon ko hi aarakshan de sakate hai
 Caste was considered a measure of this backwardness
 jetali ne kaha ki narsinghraav sarkaar ne saamaanya varg ke liye 10 fisadi aarakshan kaa notification nikaala lekin uskaa koi praavdhaan samvidhan main tha hi nahin
 Therefore, the judiciary did not accept it

 The rationale for this was that at least 50 per cent should be left for the general class or else there would have been discrimination against the other class to revive one class
 is lihaaj se maujuuda bill supreme court ke nirnay ke peeche kii bhaavana ke khilaaf nahin he
 It is to be noted that on Tuesday, the government introduced a revised bill in the Lok Sabha to give 10 percent reservation on economic basis to the general class

 After meeting with other opposition leaders, including Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's Congress President and his intention to field a candidate for the President's post on behalf of the opposition, CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury has made a statement in this regard

 When a Dalit ate food while sitting on a chair in front of the upper castes, the upper caste people beat him fiercely
 gambhir rup se ghayal hone ke baad use aspataal main bhartee karaayaa gaya jahaan 9 din baad ravivaar ko uski maut ho gai
 This issue which gives a shake to the society is of Tehri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand
 27 saal kaa dalit yuvak jitendra apane rishtedaar kii shaadi main shaamil hone 26 april ko shrikot gaanv gaya tha
 Srikot village comes under the Nainbag tehsil of Tehri Garhwal district
 isi gaanv kii shaadi main samaaj ke vibhed ko darshane vaale yah ghatana ghati
 Jitendra Das of Nainbagh Tehri found eating with the upper castes so expensive that he was so brutally killed by the upper castes due to caste discrimination that he died during treatment in the hospital
 ye dukhad khabar sunate hi hansate khelte parivaar main matam chaa gaya
 9 days after the incident, Dalit Jitendra died in a hospital in Dehradun
 meraa desh badal rahaa he, ham badal rahe hai, ham sab ek hai, lekin ye baat juthi si lagati he jab ek yuvak ko sirf is baat ke chalate beharahami se peeta jaataa he ki usne savarnon ke saamne kursi par baith kar khaanaa khaane kii himmat kii
 The incident is 9 days old when a person named Jitendra Das was having dinner at a wedding of his own community when some upper caste people came there
 jab unhone jitend ko kursi par baith kar khaanaa khate dekha to gusse se unhone pehle uski kursi par laat maari or phir uske baad uski pitayee kerani shuru kar di
 He said that how dare a dalit in front of us that he could sit and eat food in a chair
 jitendra kii itani pitayee kii gai ki usko dehradun ke indresh aspataal main bhartee karavaaya gaya jahaan 9 din ke ilaaj ke baad uski maut ho gai
 The family is in a weeping condition due to this incident
 postmortem report aane ke baad ye garib parivaar ab bete, bhai ko waapas to nahin laa saktaa lekin nyaay kii guhaar laga rahaa he
 Police have arrested three people after the death
 parijanon kaa kahana he ki 7 logon ke khilaaf namjad muqadama darj he lekin itani badi baat ho jane ke baad bhi abhi aaropee giraft se baahar hai
 Police has also arrested three when they lost their lives
 teen kii giraftaar ho chukimauke par police adhikari or dehradun esadm bhi maamle ko dekh rahe hai
 The police administration is accused by the villagers and family members that the matter was not shown sensitivity
 jab ek beqasoor chalaa gaya tab jaakar vibhaag harakat main aayaa he
 If the SDM believes the case, three have been arrested and those involved are being taken action
 ab yah sawaal lajimi he ki aakhir is maamle par nau dinon tak koi karrwai kyon nahin hui? kya prashasan maut ke baad hi jaag paaya?bhai ke insaaf ke liye ladaai ko jari rakhaahtaash or niraash, apane bete ko khoye parijanon kaa kahana he ki jab tak sabhi aropiyon kii giraftaar nahin ho jaati tab tak antim sanskaar nahin kiya jayega
 The sister of the deceased has clearly stated on the attitude of the police that the police also pressured the family to take back the case
 lekin besahaara or laachaar bahan ne apane bhai ke insaaf ke liye ladaai ko jari rakhaa he
 These question marks stand on the police that even after brutally killing Jeetendra without any fault, what is the face of the police who is talking about taking back the case instead of getting justice
 baharhaal, police ab jaakar harakat main ai he jab kisi parivaar kaa sab kuch chalaa gaya
 It remains to be seen how long the remaining convicts will be behind bars
 jo ab tak kashmir main ashaanti failaane kii firaaq main the, aaj khud unki hi shanti chhin gai he
 The Pakistani Supreme Court has given a strong shock to Army Chief General Bajwa saying that the Imran government has passed a proposal to extend his tenure for 3 years is not according to the rules
 supreme court ke faisle ke baad puure pakistan main bhuuchaal aa gaya he
 Pakistani political and military officials are in a hurry
 sabake man main ek hi sawaal he
 What will happen to Bajwa now? nahin badhegaa paak army cheef kaa kaarykapakistan kii supreme court ne sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva ko teen saal kaa kaarykaal badhaane ke faisle ko nilambit kar ke pakistan main bhuuchaal laa diya he
 Not only Pakistani political but military officers are also in awe of this decision of the Supreme Court
 kya bajva ko nahin mil paaegaa 'ekstansion'?darasal, pakistani sena pramukh general qamar javed bajva isi 29 november ko ritair ho rahe hai
 But three months before his retirement, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan issued a notification extending Bajwa's term for 3 years
 19 agast 2019 ko pradhanmantri karyaalay ne general bajva ke seva vistaar ko manjuuri di thi or isaki adhisuchana raashtrapati doctor aarif alvi ke paas bhi bheji gai thi
 It was also signed by the President
 supreme court ke faisle se PAK main hadakampamgar pakistani supreme court ne imran sarkaar ke is faisle par sawaal uthaate hue saaf kar diya he ki senadhyaksh ke kaarykaal ke kisi bhi vistaar par koi bhi adhisuchana COAS yani chif of army staff ke maujuuda kaarykaal ke puraa hone ke baad hi jari kii ja sakati he
 Which is possible only after 28 November 2019
 sena pramukh bajva ko supreme court kii noticedrasal, pakistan main senadhyaksh kii riapointment to mumkin he magar ekstansion nahin ho saktaa he
 And that's why the Supreme Court has suspended the notification of extension of tenure of General Bajwa
 iske saath hi adaalat ne pakistani sena pramukh samet sabhi pakshon ko notice jari kiya he
 After this decision of the court, Bajwa's chair is in danger
 yani sarkaar agar bajva ko senadhyaksh banaae rakhana chaahati he to pehle use bajva ke ritair hone kaa intazaar karnaa hoga or uske baad unki dobaaraa niyukti karke hi ye mumkin ho paaegaa
 The Chief Justice sought dismissal, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court against the extension of Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa by a person named Raiz Rahi
 jisane baad main ise waapas lene ke liye ek aavedan bhi diya
 However, Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khosa rejected the demand for withdrawal
 or ise janhit ke maamle main tabdeel kar diya
 Only 11 ministers supported that only 11 of the 25 members of Imran's cabinet had voted for the extension of the tenure of the army chief
 jise bahumat kaa faisla nahin kaha ja saktaa
 General Bajwa is retiring as Pakistan Army Chief on 29 November
 teen sadasyon kii bainch ne sunaaya farmansunwaayee ke dauraan pakistan ke supreme court kii teen sadasyeey bainch ne kaha ki sirf pakistan ke raashtrapati ke paas hi ye shakti he ki wo sena pramukh ke kaarykaal ko badha sake
 At the same time, Attorney General Anwar Mansoor Khan told the court that the tenure of the army chief was extended only after the approval of the President
 saath hi iske liye cabinet ne saransh ko manjuuri di thim
 14 Ministers did not give the opinion
 In response, the Pakistani judge said that the tenure extension was approved by only 11 out of 25 cabinet members
 jabaki mantrimandal ke 14 sadasyon ne gairmaujuudagi kii vajah se koi raay nahin di
 This decision of the Supreme Court is being seen as a setback for Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and Prime Minister Imran Khan
 imran se bajva ke achche sambandhaisa mana jaataa he ki pradhanmantri imran khan or general qamar javed bajva main bahut achche sambandh hai or agar supreme court bajva ko hataane kaa nirdesh detaa he to ye unke liye pareshaan karne vaala hoga
 General Bajwa became the Chief of the Pakistani Army in November 2016
 tatkaaleen pradhanmantri nawaz shareef ne bajva ke haathon main sena kii kaman di thi
 Bajwa had helped Imran in the election! Now the question is why Imran Khan is intent on extending the tenure of General Bajwa by keeping the rules in mind
 ise samajhane ke liye pichley saal hue pakistani chunaav ke vakt main lautnaa hoga kyonki jin bajva kii gutthi aaj ulajh gai he, uskaa sira inhen chunaavon se shuru hota he
 When Imran Khan established his government in Pakistan, bypassing the predictions of all political pundits
 or tab unke saath kadam ba kadam sena pramukh general bajva chal rahe the
 Is Imran paying off Bajwa's debt! And all of them know that the Prime Minister in Pakistan becomes the one who likes the Army's mind
 tab bajva imran ke saath khadey the or ab imran bajva ke saath khadey hokar unka karz utaar rahe hai
