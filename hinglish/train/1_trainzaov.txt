 The Congress is adamant on the demand for his resignation in the case of former IPL chief Lalit Modi

 They asked me not to resign, but i did not listen to anyone

 ) The night of 2011, which made India the world champion of cricket after 28 years, is not forgotten
 2 april 2011 ko team india ne cricket ke itihaas main ek nayaa adhyay jod diya tha
 The biggest contribution of the young players of the team was behind that big victory of Team India

 salaamcricket: team india ke 2015 world cap jeetne kii sambhaavna par mili juli pratikriya
 'winning the World Cup was like a dream' During the conversation, Yuvraj Singh said that winning the World Cup was like a dream
 yuvaraj ne kaha, 'world cap jeetne ke baad main puri raat so nahin paaya
 Yuvraj acknowledged that the then coach Gary Kirsten was a major contributor to Team India's victory
 yuvaraj ne kaha ki gairi ne team main unity ko banaae rakhaa
 He taught us how to play to win
 captain mahendra singh dhoni ke bare main yuvaraj ne kaha ki beshak kisi bhi team ke liye achche captain kaa hona bahut jaruri hota he or dhoni ne bahut mehnat kii thi
 But along with the captain, every player also has to work equally hard at their own level
 is dauraan yuvaraj ne darshakon se ek mjedaar baat bhi saajha kii
 Yuvraj told that after winning the World Cup, he slept all night with the trophy on his bed, because he believed that the moment was very emotional and how can you put such hard earned money on the ground
 health se bhi pehle world cap jeetna mere dimag main thah yuvaraj singh
 Harbhajan Singh told an interesting story before the World Cup
 harbhajan ne bataaya ki world cap shuru hone ke kuch maheene pehle harbhajan or yuvaraj mumbai ke vankhede stadium gaye the, jahaan harbhajan ne baton hi baton main yuvaraj se kaha tha ki isi maidan main agar ham apane haathon main world cap uthaaenge, to bahut acha lagegaa or sanyog se harbhajan kii kahi ye baaten sach sabit ho gayi
 At the same time, Piyush Chawla said that his performance was not very good before the World Cup but only for the World Cup he worked hard and joined the World Cup squad
 piyush ne kaha ki squad main shaamil hona hi unke liye ek sapane kii tarah tha
 The trio opened on the stage many players like Yuvraj, Harbhajan and Piyush together, it is bound to be a joke
 chaahe maidan ho yaa maidan ke baahar, yuvaraj or harbhajan hameshaa majaak karte hue najar aate hai
 When Harbhajan was questioned in this regard, he said that it is equally important to enjoy the game
 khel main bhi ek fan element hona chahie
 However, Harbhajan also said that where i have to do fun, i do fun and where Sirius is to happen, i am Sirius
 yuvaraj sihan se jab ye poocha gaya ki world cap jeetne ke baad dhoni ne bal kyon mundava liye the to unka kahana tha ki dhoni ne world cap ke liye mannath maangi thi isliye unhone aisa kiya tha
 Yuvraj revealed Dhoni's pole that Dhoni had cleaned his hair on his own and later when he entered our room we refused to recognize him
 teenon hi khilaadiyon ne team india kii is jeet kaa shrey coach gairi, team ek anya sadsy or puure karo diya
 Harbhajan said that the entire country stood with us along with the 21 people of the team and the same thing was helpful in increasing our confidence

 He says that the Modi government did nothing for the weavers within a year
 suvidhaon ke abhaav main kaam thapp he
 The comments jaitpura ke asamalam siddiki varsh 1994 se hi bunakari ke kaam se jude hai
 He is unhappy with the functioning of the NDA government, but he wants to give more time to Modi

 Gurmeet Ram Rahim Sadhvi has been convicted in the sexual abuse case
 panchakula kii vishesh sibiai adaalat kaa faisla deraa pramukh ke khilaaf aane ke baad unke samarthakon ne punjab or haryana ke saath-saath kai rajyon main hangaamaa kiya
 There was anticipation of this thing already, but now it is being discussed that the property of the Arabs of Dera will now be named
 haalanki faisle ke baad hue bavaal se naaraaz punjab-haryana court ne deraa kii sampattiyon ko jabt karne kaa aitihaasik faisla sunaaya he
 However, it is still necessary to know who will be with the power of the Dera after Gurmeet Ram Rahim goes to jail
 kyonki ummid kii ja rahi he ki gurmeet ko 28 agast ko kam se kam 7 saal kii sajaa to honi he
 Gurmeet can remain a dera chief
 There is also a discussion that the current dera chief Gurmeet Singh Ram Rahim can take charge of the Dera Sacha Sauda even further
 ve jail se hi apane samrajya ko chalaa sakate hai
 Because they have not made any announcement in this matter so far
 gurmeet ke bete kii bhi charchaa lekin ye aasaan nahinkuch log yah bhi kah rahe hai ki gurmeet ke baad deraa sachcha sauda kii bagdor unke bete jasmit singh insa sanbhaalenge
 Gurmeet is said to have announced the appointment of Jasmeet Insa as his successor in 2007 when the CBI filed a charge sheet against Gurmeet
 lekin aisa hona itnaa aasaan nahin he
 The biggest reason behind this is a rule of dera
 niyam ke mutabik deraa kaa aglaa pramukh maujuuda pramukh ke parivaar yaa khandaan se nahin ho saktaa he
 Also tell you here that apart from Jasmeet, Gurmeet has two daughters (charanpreet Insa and Amanpreet Insa)
 baba kii ek teesri beti bhi he, haniprit insa, inako gurmeet ne god liya tha
 Then who? Now the question deepens that if not Jasmeet, then who will take charge of the dera
 philhal deraa pramukh ke taur par sabhi kii ankhen 35 saal kii guru brahmacharee vipasna par tiki hui hai
 Vipassana is considered second in the dera
 ve hi hai jinke paas apni ore se chizon par faisla karne kaa ekmaatr adhikaar he
 Vipassana has completed her graduation from the girls' college run by Dera
 vipasna ke under 250 logon kii team kaam karti he jisamen se kareeb 150 mahilaayein hai
 Vipassana conducts social service projects run by Dera
 jinamein senaaon ke liye raktadan shivi or asahaay or garib bhakton ke liye samarpit yojanaayen bhi shaamil hai
 There is a name and further that apart from the lapse, there is another name in the dera which is considered close and loyal to the current Dera chief Gurmeet
 35 saal kii haniprit ko vipasna ke takkar main dekha ja rahaa he
 Honeypreet is also Guru Brahmachari like Vipassana
 wo 7 pichley saat saalon se deraa pramukh ke saath hai or unki khaas maani jaati hai
 Honeypreet has also acted in all of Gurmeet Ram Rahim's films
 agar deraa pramukh apni sahmati dete hai to haniprit bhi satta sambhaal sakati hai
 Please also tell here that Honeypreet Insa is the adopted daughter of Gurmeet Ram Rahim
 is vajah se inaki niyukti main deraa pramukh ke chayan kaa upar likhaa parivaar vaala niyam bhi aade nahin aata he
 Honeypreet's pan is also considered heavy because she was with Gurmeet on Friday while going to jail and was walking with him carrying his luggage
 kaaphi bada he deraa kaa samrajyadera kii haryana ke sirsa main lagbhag 700 acre kheti kii jameen he
 There are around 250 ashrams in the world besides three hospitals, an International Eye Bank, gas station and market complex
 iske alaava deraa ke tamaam bank acount bhi hai jo abhi tak saamne nahin aae hai
 The dera chief also has a long convoy of luxury cars

 Shah Satnam Maharaj took over the throne after Shah Mastana Maharaj
 unhone saal 1990 main apane anuyaayi sant gurmeet singh ko gaddi saunp di
 After this, Saint Gurmeet Ram was renamed Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Insa

 The central government may end the subsidy on domestic cylinders for those earning more than 10 lakhs annually in its next budget

 In one proposal, the income limit for abolishing subsidy has been kept at 10 and in another, 20 lakh per annum

 In the fake signature case of some mps on the letter written to US President Barack Obama on the appeal of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi not to be granted visa, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar said on Thursday that she is investigating it
 obama ko likhe patr par farji hastakshar hone sambandhi shikaayat karte hue jharkhand ke lohaardagga se bijepi saansad sudarshan bhagat ne buudhvaar ko mira kumaar ko patr likhaa tha
 Meera Kumar said that they have received a member's letter in this regard and they have sent it for investigation
 saansadon dwaara is prakaar kisi duusare rashtradhyaksh ko patr likhe jane ke uchit yaa anuchit hone ke sawaal par kisi prakaar kii tippanee karne se inkaar karte hue mira kumaar ne kaha ki vah is masale par patr kii jaanch hone ke baad hi koi tippanee karengi
 Asked whether this becomes a case of breach of privilege or disciplinary action, Meera Kumar merely reiterated that the matter is being investigated and it would not be appropriate to say anything before that
 kathith taur par sansad ke 65 sadasyon kii ore se america ke raashtrapati baraak obama ko patr likhaa gaya tha ki vah modi ko vija nahin dene kii apane desh kii niti ko jari rakhen
 The letter is signed by cpi-m's Sitaram Yechury, dmk's KP Ramalingam and Communist Party MP Achuthan, but all three have refused to sign any such letter
 jharkhand ke lohardagga se loksabhaa sadsy sudarshan bhagat ne mira kumaar ko likhe patr main kaha he ki kuch sadasyon ne obama ko likhe patr main hastakshar karne se inkaar kiya he, isliye puure maamle kii jaanch karai jaae
 Bhagat had said on Wednesday, "this is a serious matter and is akin to forgery
" maine loksabhaa adhyaksh se maang kii he ki vah maamle kii nishpaksh jaanch ke aadesh den or is dhokhadhadi ke liye jo jimmedaar hai, unke viruddh karrwai kii jaae
 '' yechuri ne bhi kaha tha ki obama ko bheje gaye patr par unke hastakshar ‘‘cat and paste’’ kaa maamla lagata he
 Yechury issued a statement on Wednesday, saying, "I categorically deny that i have signed any such letter
" kisi ek desh kii samprabhutaa ke daayre main aane vaale mudde par duusare kisi samprabhu desh se kuch kahana na to mere charitra main he or na hi yah meri party makapa kaa siddhant he
 '' dramuk ke ramlingam ne bhi patr par hastakshar karne se inkaar kiya or kaha ki vah hameshaa tamil main hastakshar karte hai
 But he had no answer to this when he was told that the signature next to his name is in Tamil

 ’’ nirdaleey saansad mohammad adib ne obama ko patr likhane kaa abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 The letter to Obama has signatures of 40 members of the Lok Sabha and 25 members of the Rajya Sabha

 The letter to Obama has signatures of 40 members of the Lok Sabha and 25 members of the Rajya Sabha
 mira kumaar ne bataaya ki unhen is sambandh main ek sadsy kaa patr mila he or unhone use jaanch ke liye bhej diya he
 While refusing to comment on the question of whether mps were justified or inappropriate in writing a letter to another head of state, Meira Kumar said that she would make any comments on the issue only after scrutiny of the letter
 yah puche jane par ki kya yah visheshadhikaar hanan yaa anushaasanamak karrwai kaa maamla banataa he, mira kumaar ne keval yahi doharaaya ki maamle kii jaanch karai ja rahi he or usase pehle kuch bhi kahana uchit nahin hoga
 It was reportedly written to US President Barack Obama on behalf of 65 members of Parliament to continue his country's policy of not granting visas to Modi
 is patr par makapa ke seetaram yechuri, dramuk ke capi ramlingam or communist party ke empi achyutan ke hastakshar hai, lekin in teenon ne aise kisi patr par hastakshar karne se inkaar kiya he
 Lok Sabha member Sudarshan Bhagat from Lohardaga in Jharkhand has written to Meera Kumar that some members have refused to sign in the letter to Obama, so the entire matter should be investigated
 bhagat ne buudhvaar ko kaha tha, ‘‘yah gambhir maamla he or jaalsaaji ke samaan he
 i have demanded the Lok Sabha Speaker to order an impartial inquiry into the matter and action should be taken against those responsible for this fraud
 ’’ Yechury also said that his signature on the letter sent to Obama seems to be a case of "cut and paste"
 yechuri ne buudhvaar ko ek bayaan jari kar kaha tha, ‘‘main is baat se saaf inkaar karata hum ki maine aise kisi patr par hastakshar kiya he
 It is neither in my character to say anything to any other sovereign country on the issue of the sovereignty of one country, nor is it the principle of my party's CPI (M)
 ’’ Ramalingam of DMK also refused to sign the letter and said that he always signs in Tamil
 lekin is baat kaa unke paas koi jawaab nahin tha jab unhen bataaya gaya ki unke naam ke aage jo hastakshar he vah tamil main hi he
 The comments kerala se rajyasabha sadsy achyutan ne bhi hastakshar se inkaar karte hue kaha, ‘‘sach bataaun to obama ko patr likhane ke bare main mujhe yaad nahin
 Independent MP Muhammad Adeeb campaigned to write a letter to Obama

 com / qjcgoelv7i — Supriya Bhardwaj (@ Supriya23bh) October 23, 2017 Already speaking with the Congress, Alpesh was with the Congress from 2009 to 2012
 alpesh ke pita khodaaji thakor bhi congress ke puraane netaa rahe hai or abhi ahmedabad ke gramin jila adhyaksh hai
 At the same time, Alpesh also contested the last district panchayat election on a Congress ticket, but lost
 iske saath hi congress ne patel aarakshan andolan ke netaa hardik patel or dalit netaa jignesh mevani ko bhi is raily main shaamil hone kii daavat di thi
 However, in conversation with India Today, both these leaders have denied any such invitation
 yuva shakti kaa saathgujrat kii satta se congress 22 saal se baahar chal rahi congress is baar singhaasana par vaapasi kii puri koshish kar rahi he
 65 percent of the state's population is below 35 years of age, the Congress is trying to reach this power by serving this 'youth power'
 iske liye party hardik patel, mevani or thakor jaise yuva netaaon ko apni taraf laane kii koshish kar rahi he
 These leaders have considerable support base in their communities
 gujarat ke ran main alpesh kaa mahatvagujrat ke chunavi ran main alpesh thakor kaa mahatv isi se samajha he ki thakor jis obisi samudaay ke pratinidhitiv kaa daawa karte hai, rajya main uski aabaadi 54 fisadi ke kareeb he
 This is the reason why Alpesh is running his bets very cleverly on the election backing
 vah saarvajanik manchon se bijepi ko haraane kii har mumkin koshish kii ghoshnaa kar chuke hai
 hardik-jignesh will be together? Jignesh Mevani has made his mark as a young Dalit leader in the state
 jignesh peshey se vakil or saamaajik kaaryakarta hai
 The state has around 7 per cent Dalit voters
 aise main rajya str par yah sankhya to kam lagati he, lekin rashtriya str par congress ke sapanom par paravaan chadhaane main yah dalit votbank kaaphi ahm bhoomika nibhaa saktaa he
 As far as the Patels are concerned in the state, they may not be such a large population by number, but this section is considered very influential in the state
 aise main hardik patel agar congress ke saath aate yaa samarthan karte hai, to congress ko isse bade siyaasi phaayde kii ummid he
 Both these leaders have been outright anti-bjp, but they have not announced their support for the Congress so far
 aise main rahul gandhi kii raily main in donon netaaon kaa bhi samarthan milane kii ummid kii ja rahi he
 With the help of three maharathis, the Congress in Mission 125 may be the reason that Gujarat Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki has been openly trying to bring these three leaders together
 beete dinon solanka ne bharosa jataayaa ki in netaaon ke 'samarthan or aashirwad' se party kul 182 siton main 125 se zyada siten aasaani se jeet jaaegi
 Solanki told reporters, "although the BJP is trying its best to win the election, it will not succeed in stopping Congress's victory march for Gandhinagar
 'congress in teenon yuva netaaon ke saath jediu netaa chotu vasava ko bhi apane saath laane kii koshish main he
 In the Rajya Sabha elections, Vasava went beyond the party line and voted for Congress candidate Ahmed Patel and this was how his victory was ensured

 Safety of trains is a major challenge due to apprehension of external hand in rail accidents
 iske maddenjar bhartiya railway ne apane sabhi afasaron ko raat main chalane vaali trainon main foot plating karne ke nirdesh jari kiye hai
 Despite all this, the recurring railway accidents are really a cause for concern

 But it is not possible to say this clearly without investigation
 lihaaja railway ne sabhi rajyon se guhaar kii he ki vah apane police tantra ko puri tarah se alert rakhen jisase is tarah kii kisi ghatana ko samay rahete roka ja sake

 ' bijepi or shivasena ne saath milakar chunaav ladasarkaar banane ko jaruri aankada bhi paar kar liyamharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke nateezon kii ghoshnaa hue kareeb ek maheene ho chuke hai, lekin abhi tak sarkaar kaa gathan nahin ho paaya he
 Voters are just speculating whose government is going to be formed in the state
 bijepi or shivasena ne saath milakar chunaav ladaa tha or 288 siton vaali vidhansabha main sarkaar banane ke liye jaruri aankada bhi paar kar liya, lekin nattejey aane ke baad shivasena pramukh uddhav thakare ne mukhyamantri pad ke liye 50-50 kaa formula lagu karne kii maang uthaa di
 This means that the Shiv Sena should have been the Chief Minister for two and a half years and the BJP for two and a half years
 105 siton ke saath sabase badi party banakar ubhari bijepi ne 56 siton vaali shivasena kii yah maang thukraa di or is tarah 30 saal purana bhagava gathbandhan tut gaya
 After this, Shiv Sena along with opposition parties NCP and Congress started exploring the option of forming a government
 congress ko is chunaav main 44 siten or ensipi ko 54 siten mili hai
 The Shiv Sena along with these two parties is trying to keep the BJP out of power and make it its chief minister
 maharashtra main 12 november serashtrapati shashanlagu he or sabase badi party hone ke baavjood bijepi alag-thalag pad gai he
 However, an in-depth analysis of the seats won by the BJP reveals interesting things
 india today kii data intelegence unit (DIU) ne ashoka uniwarsity ketrivedi central for polytical data (tcpd)ke chunavi aankadon kaa vishleshan kiya or paaya ki ensipi or congress ke baagi jo chunaav ke thik pehle bijepi main shaamil ho gaye, unhone bijepi ko sau se zyada siten laane main madad kii
 Had the BJP not joined the defectors of the Congress and the NCP, the BJP would have barely reached 100 seats
 khiskaa janaadhar2014 main bijepi or shivasena ne siton ke bantwaare par talmail na ho paane ke kaaran agal-alag chunaav ladaa tha
 In this election, BJP got 122 seats and Shiv Sena got 63 seats
 raajnneetik vishleshak maanate hai ki loksabhaa chunaav main bijepi or shivasena ne milakar 48 main se 41 loksabhaa siten jeet lee thim, aise main saath chunaav ladane par maharashtra vidhansabha unke liye or aasaan hona chahie
 But this time it did not happen
 DIU ne paaya ki is baar bijepi or shivasena 68 aisi siten haar gayi jinpar 2014 main unako jeet mili thi
 The anti incumbency rate of this election was 36 percent
 bijepi ne inamen se apni 34 fisadi yani 41 siten gavaan deen
 In this election, Shiv Sena gave ticket to 11 defectors of NCP and Congress, while BJP gave ticket to 15 defectors, out of which 10 won the election
 is tarah agar ye dalbadalu nahin hote to bijepi kareeb 95 siton par simat gai hoti
 Sources in the Shiv Sena told India Today that the Shiv Sena was hopeful that this time it would win the 63 seats it had contested in an alliance with the BJP, and would win additional seats
 lekin aisa nahin hua or shivasena apni 42 fisadi yani 27 aisi siten haar gai jis par 2014 main use jeet mili thi
 Party sources said that political strategist Prashant Kishor presented the party in a very ambitious manner, which upset the Chief Minister's face Aditya Thackeray on behalf of the Shiv Sena
 dalbadaluon kii bhoomikahaalanki, antim nateezon ke tahat mili siton kii kul sankhya endie ke liye niraashajanak ho sakati he, lekin yah gaur karne laayak he ki bhaajapa or shivasena gathbandhan ne 44 aisi siten jhatak leen jo 2014 main ve haar gai thim
 24 such seats came in the account of BJP and 20 Shiv Sena
 bijepi jitani nai siten jiti he unamem se 12 (50 fisadi) par dalbadalu pratyaashee jite hai
 There are 9 of these who were in NCP or Congress in the last election
 shivasena ne 20 aisi siten jeetin jinpar vah pichhali baar haar gai thi
 Of these, defectors won 7 (35 per cent)
 inamen se ek ensipi se, ek congress se, do manase se, ek nirdaleey or do choti partiyon se shivasena main shaamil hue the
 In this way, we can say that if the Congress and NCP were not defectors, the Shiv Sena would have been reduced to 54 seats in this election
 kya dalbadaluon kii ghar vaapasi hogi?ab jab maharashtra main bijepi kii sarkaar banane kii sambhaavna ksheen ho gai he to kya congress or ensipi se bijepi main gaye netaa in partiyon main waapas aa sakate hai? ensipi ke varisht netaa nawab malik kaa maananaa he ki aisa ho saktaa he
 Nawab Malik told India Today, “there are about 70 BJP mlas who either joined the party in 2014 or joined in 2019 on the promise of participation in power
 bijepi ab dari hui he ki ve hamaare paas waapas aa sakate hai or unamem se ek ne to khuleam ensipi pramukh sharad pavaar se mulaakaat bhi kii he
 "he said," Some mlas from Satara and Pune have contacted Ajit Pawar
 haalanki, ham bijepi kii tarah bha rti abhiyaan nahin chalaayenge balki yogyata ke aadhaar par chunaav karenge

 bollywood film abhinayta irfan khan ne mangalvaar ko dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal se dilli sachivalay main mulaakaat kii
 He interviewed Arvind Kejriwal for 20 minutes on questions related to the common man
 darasal,irfan khan kii film 'madari'relies hone vaali he jisamen baap or bete ke rishte kii kahani he
 The son dies in an accident and then begins a fight with a common man's system
 isi ko lekar irfan khan desh ke bade netaaon se milakar unase kuch janata se jude sawaal puch rahe hai
 Earlier, he also met Laloo Yadav
 irfan khan ne pradhanmantri modi ko bhi chitthee likhi he
 Kejriwal said- Man alone cannot do anything
 Irfan Khan asked Arvind Kejriwal a few questions
 jaise ki jo netaa vaade karte hai or vaade nibhaa nahin pate unke upar kanoonee karwai honi chahie
 He also said that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that one man cannot change the system
 sabhi ko saath aana chahie
 Irrfan Khan, who was uneasy on the promotion question, replied to media questions after meeting Arvind Kejriwal
 jab unase netaaon se aam aadmi ke sawaal poochkar film promoshan karne kaa sawaal poocha gaya to wo kaaphi asahaj najar aae
 Also when asked that it is not easy for the general public to meet the Chief Minister but it is easy for the film actor to meet
 iskaa bhi vah koi sateek jawaab nahin de paae
 Irfan Khan said that Rahul Gandhi has also talked about meeting
 chal meri lunaa”, “chutki main chipkaae”, “kuch meetha ho jaae” jaise sahaj vigyaapan sandeshon kaa “achche din aane vaale hai” se kya rishta he? yakeen karnaa mushkil he lekin hakeekat main bijepi ke loksabhaa chunaav main achche dinon vaala sandesh, inhen sahaj vigyapanon se prerit tha, jo haal ke dashakon main prabhavi rajnatik parivartan ke samvaad kaa sabase bada pratimaan banakar ubhara
 Election promises, politicians' comments and power changes are, of course, not like advertising messages
 phir “achche din” aane kaa sandesh itnaa bada vaada tha jiske saamne kuch bhi nahin tikaa
 One has to praise Ad Guru Piyush Pandey, not only for the message that goes straight to the heart, but also that he openly acknowledged in his new book that "good days are coming" without worrying about being politically correct and wrong Wale hai ”were similar chocolaty ads in the background of the message
 narendra modi ke loksabhaa chunaav abhiyaan kii vigyaapan ranneeti kii kaman pandey ke haath main thi jo pramukh vigyaapan agency oandem ke agxcutive chairman or creative diarector hai
 The jingle of "this time Modi government" was also due to his creativity
 pandey ne apni aatmakatha pandemonium main likhaa he ki july 2013 main aae chunavi surveykshan bijepi kii badhat to dikhaa rahe the lekin bahumat nahin
 Hung Parliament was expected
 7 sitambar, 2013 ko modi ke pradhanmantri pad kaa pratyaashee banane ke baad, bijepi ke chunaav abhiyaan kaa lead campan, soho square ko mila jo ki oandem kii agency he
 Pandey writes, "as soon as we understood what the voters wanted to hear, we started telling them what they could trust
 ” yakeenan pandey apni jagah sahi the
 He was creating an ad creative for the BJP on the lines of a product or service, though he probably did not know that he was writing a message of a political change, not a chocolate or a bike, whose dimensions and impact were going to be infinite
 “achche din” bahut bhavy rajnatik vaada tha, jise bharat to chhodie, viksit deshon ke netaa bhi karne main hichakenge
 As 2015 passed, the most grand message of change turned into a deep-seated breakdown of expectations, rather it would be impossible for the Prime Minister himself to stop this vow assurance from becoming a "jumla"
 aisa isliye hua chunki hamaare rajaneta pichley chunaav main rajnatik sanvaadon or upabhokta prachaar ke bich gahare antar ko laangh gaye the
 He did not mind raising hopes that he would have to give a plan to do what he said and then eventually show it
 achche dinon kaa anti clymex bharat ke rajnatik sanvaadon ke badbhole or adhakacharepan kaa nayaa pratik he
 Not only Modi, the other hero Kejriwal also slipped
 sab kuch janata se poochkar karne ke vaadon or dilli ko chutkiyon main badalane kii ummiido ke bainks kejariwal sarkaar ahankaar kii ladaai se bhar gai or nai raajnneeti or nai gavarnence kii ummiden dhah gayi
 In 2015, the disease spread so much that the whole year would be known for the statements of poisonous, flamboyant, peppy, stupid, sophistic, factless, baseless legs
 netaaon kii yah phislan thik us vakt najar ai jab nirnaayak janadesh dene ke baad log apane netaaon se abhootpurv gambhirtha, saakh or samajhadaari kii apeksha kar rahe the
 Interestingly, after the invention of the Internet and a click-past collective memory (digital archive), when the facilities are available to test the past, the Indian politicians got more into the habit of speaking anything
 2015 main netaa munh baakar bole isliye unke bayanon kii taasir parakhane main logon ne bhi kotahi nahin kii
 This was the first time when the society became so vocal with digital activism on the lies and blatantness of the government and leaders in India, which came under increasing scrutiny on the credibility of politics and governance week after week
 2015 hamaare taaja ateet main pehla varsh tha jab saamaajik-aarthik vikaas ke aankadon par bade shaq-shubahe paidaa hue
 Generally, there are not many questions about large government figures in India such as GDP, inflation, exports, production, social development, but this year's debates focused not on the new model of reforms but on the factuality of statistics and claims that make up a huge democracy
 In India, there was growing suspicion about the facts and the fear of lies
 antatru sarkaar ne disambar main jo chamahi aarthik samiksha sansad main rakhi vah aarthik tasviir ko gulabi nahin balki chunauteepurn bataati he
 Therefore, in 2016, the government will also have to keep in mind that the election promises may still go on, but in a liberal global market, the juggernaut of data overwhelms the credibility of the country
 sarkaron, sansthaaon or kaarobaariyon ke bich bharose kii paimaaish ko lekar edalman kaa global trust barometer survey kaaphi pratishthit he jo har saal janvari main aata he
 The survey in January 2015 placed India in the top five countries, which are full of confidence, but due to a lack of confidence in the government, India has slipped from third to fifth in this ranking
 2015 main yah dhalaan bad gai he
 After money, if anything else is deeply intertwined with politics, it is the lies and blatantness of the leaders
 pratispardhi raajnneeti main doordarshita or dur kii kaudi ke bich vibhaajak rekha patali he
 Leaders often skip it
 ummiido ke kile bananaa thik he lekin log ab in kilon kii buniyaad banane main deree bardaasht nahin karte
 The modern society is now facing the politicians of India
 jo thage jane ke ehsaas se sabase zyada chidhata he or jhooth ko jhooth va sach ko sach kehane se nahin hichakataa
 Another popular election jingle of the BJP in the 2014 election was "the public will not forgive
" ” pandey likhte hai ki bachapan main unhone baar-baar suna tha ki “bhagwaan maaf nahin karegaa
 "this saying was the basis of this jingle
" hamaare netaaon ko kuch bhi bolte hue ab yah yaad rakhana hoga ki janata maaf

" umr sarkaar main cabinet mantri evam varisht congress netaa taj mohiuddeen ne kaha ki mukhyamantri ne mudde par unase vichaar vimarsh kiya tha
 He, however, said that the possibility of the AFSPA being removed should be decided jointly by the army intelligence agencies and the state police
 soj ne kaha mukhyamantri dwaara vichaar vimarsh nahin kiye jane ko lekar mujhe koi shikaayat nahin he
 He could also know opinions on the phone from me
 
 However, the Union Home Ministry should have talked to the main parties like the Defense Ministry, the Congress party and the army
 rajya sarkaar main sahyogi congress ke saath vichaar vimarsh ke abhaav ke aaropon ke sandarbh main soj ne kaha ki aisa lagata he ki umr khud hi gol karnaa chaahate hai lekin khel aise nahin khelaa jaataa

 In response to a question, he said that there is no truth in the fact that the Congress is trying to destabilize the Omar government which is to complete three years
 mohiuddeen ne kaha ki congress eexspie ko hataae jane ke khilaaf nahin he
 The Congress has no objection if the local police forces and intelligence agencies say that the law can be lifted
 unhone kaha congress logon ke khilaaf nahin he lekin saath hi ham koi jokhim nahin uthaa sakate
 Meanwhile, CPI (M) State Secretary MY Tarigami said that steps like removal of AFSPA would provide relief to the people of the state but such an initiative should not be treated as an agreement with the entire security needs

 filmon main debyue karne ja raheen jahnavi ne apana janmdin behad saadagi ke saath manaaya
 She went to an old age home on Tuesday, where she celebrated her birthday with the elders and took her blessings
 dekhen videobta den ki boni kapur ne apane intervyuu main bataaya tha ki jahnavi ne apni maa shridevi ke dubai jane se pehle unhen shopping ke liye ek lambii list di thi
 This list was in his mobile, but Sridevi could not do shopping due to leaving the mobile somewhere else
 durbhagyavash shanivaar kii raat unka asamay nidhan ho gaya
 Fees used to cost up to 5 crores for the film, know - how big empire has left Sridevi Shridevi also wrote a post remembering her mother
 shridevi jahnavi ke berthde par aksar unki bachapan kii kute tasviren post kar unhen janmdin kii badhai detii thim

 unhen pyaar karte rahen or khud ko us pyaar ko mahasoos karne ke liye samarpit karte hai
 They made you and i want to say that you miss my mother, pray for her soul for peace
 unke liye apana pyaar or prashansa jari rakhie
 Jahnavi also asked people to respect the relationship of parents
 unhone likhaa, 'kripaya yah jaan len ki meri maa sabase zyada pyaar kisi par nyochhavar karti thim to wo papa the
 And their love is immortal because there was nothing that filled the world with happiness
 jitne samarpit wo ek-duusare ke liye the shaayad hi koi doosraa kabhi ho saktaa he
 Please respect this
 'is mulaakaat main shakti kapur ke bigadel role ko yaad kar hans padi thim shridevijahnvi ne likhaa, 'maine or khushi ne hamaari maa kho di, lekin papa ne apni jaan kho di he
 She was much more than just an actress, mother or wife
 vah apane har kirdaar main best or bemisaal thim
 Giving love and getting love was important in his life
 logon ke liye acha or dayaalu hona or kabhi bhi niraashaa, frustation yaa jalan kya hoti he wo nahin samajhati thim
 So give love to her as she was
 ye baat shaayad unhen unki maut ke baad bhi khush rakh sake or unhen ye lage ki unhone kabhi aapako kuch diya tha
 Only fill well and give love only to make him happy, to know that even in death, he gave you everything

 ' The refuge of terrorism, Pakistan is not taking the name of eradicating its antics
 usne ek baar phir se parmaanu yuddh kii gidadbhabhaki di he
 Pakistan's National Security Advisor Lt Gen Nasir Khan Janjua said the US is favoring India over the Kashmir dispute
 dakshin asia main suraksha halaat behad najuk ho gaye hai, jiske chalate parmaanu yuddh chhid saktaa he
 This is not the first time Pakistan has shown its nuclear weapons bullying
 isse pehle pichley saal pakistan ke tatkaaleen rakshaamantri khwaja asif ne bhi bharat par parmaanu hamalaa karne kii dhamkee di thi
 India and the United States had raised strong objections to this
 somvaar ko islamabad main ek seminar ko sambodhit karte hue janjua ne kaha ki dakshin asia kshetra main asthirataa kaa maahaul he
 The security situation has become very critical
 aise main parmaanu yuddh se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In a seminar organized by the Center for Global and Strategic Studies on the topic "national Security policy-vision for Pakistan", he said that India is collecting a large number of deadly weapons, which are a constant threat to Pakistan
 unhone kaha ki dakshin asia main santulan banaae rakhane ke liye vishesh prayaas karne kii jarurat he, taaki bade vinaash ko taala ja sake
 This test was done in response to India's nuclear test, on 11 May 1998, India conducted its second nuclear test in Pokhran, Rajasthan
 iske baad pakistan ne bharat ke parmaanu pareekshan ke jawaab main apana pehla newclear test kiya tha
 This was confirmed by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
 unhone kaha tha, ‘agar bharat apana newclear test na karata, to ham bhi na karte
 But due to India's doing this, there was a lot of pressure on us, due to which we also conducted our first nuclear test
 ’ haalanki is baat ko lekar donon deshon main kaaphi tanaav paidaa ho gaya tha
 Talking about nuclear weapons, Pakistan is ahead of India, Pakistan is ahead of not only India but also Israel and North Korea
 uske paas kareeb 120 parmaanu hathiyaar hai, jo ki bharat ke mukaable 10 hathiyaar zyada he or puri duniya ko khatm karne ke liye kaaphi he
 According to a US report, Pakistan has the capacity to produce about 20 nuclear weapons every year
 bharat kii sainya takat zyadabharat-pakistan kii sainya takat kii agar tulana kii jaae to bharat usase kahin aage he
 The number of Indian soldiers is 1
3 million and that is six and a half lakh of Pakistan, which is half of India
 bharat kii sainya takat se barabari karne ke liye pakistan apane parmaanu hathiyaaron kaa utpaadan badha rahaa he
 Why it repeatedly threatens nuclear attack: Pakistan has more nuclear weapons than India, so it keeps threatening India with nuclear attacks again and again
 pakistan ke newclear program ko dekhne vaale abdul kadir khan ne ek baar bhadakaau bayaan main kaha tha, ‘pakistan ke parmaanu bam dilli ko 5 minute main tabah kar sakate hai
 'it was only in 1984 that the father of the nuclear program, Pakistan's Nuclear Program Abdul Qadir Khan, had said that Pakistan was capable of conducting nuclear tests in 1984 itself
 lekin tatkaaleen raashtrapati ‘jiya ul haq’ is vichaar ke virodh main the, jiske chalate pakistan ne aisa nahin kiya

 India dismissed the Pakistani Foreign Minister's statement as irresponsible and absurd
 bataa den, pakistan videsh mantri ne kaha tha ki bharat pakistan par phir se hamalaa karegaa
 India said that the statement of the Pakistani Foreign Minister is about to create a furore in the region
 bhartiya videsh mantralay ne apane bayaan main kaha ki is hatkande se aisa lagata he ki pakistan apane aatankwaadiyon se bharat main hamalaa karana chahta he
 Pakistan should take credible, stable steps against terrorism rather than making statements that diverge from the main issue
 bharat ne pakistan ko hone vaale aatankwaadi ghatnaon ko lekar thos khufia jaankaree ko saajha karne ke liye sthapit kootnithik, dijiemo madhyamon kaa prayog karne kii salaah di

 i did not miss films, but i definitely missed the creative atmosphere, good friends, roaming the streets of Mumbai, i missed it all

 com / whcb1w9kal— CM Office, goup (@cmofficeup)february 12, 2016 Team Anna 11 to fast in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex
 31 lakh chukaane main asamarthta jataate hue kaha ki anna kaa anshan five star anshan nahin he
 Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal says that he cannot use such an expensive place
 isliye ab vah mumbai main nai jagah kii talash kar rahe hai
 Indeed, expressing disappointment over the new draft of Lokpal Bill being prepared to be tabled in Parliament, Anna Hazare said that he would sit on fast for three days from December 27 and thereafter, a jail bharo movement would be organized for three days
 hajaare ne kaha, main 27, 28 or 29 disambar ko anshan karuunga
 After this, a three-day Jail Bharo movement will be started from December 30
 uske baad main paanch rajyon (jahaan vidhansabha chunaav hone hai) kaa daura karuunga or congress nit sarkaar ke khilaaf prachaar karuunga
 Expressing doubt on the intention of the government in bringing an effective Lokpal Bill, Hazare said that the government is ignoring the voice of the people
 unhone kaha, aam aadmi kii jindagi chaaron ore faile bhrashtachar se takalifdeh ho gai he lekin sarkaar andhi ho gai he
 She cannot see or hear the public distress
 hajaare ne kaha, sarkaar ko apane raste jane den
 We will walk our way
 maine faisla kar liya he ki jab tak jaan he sangharsh karata rahoonga
 When asked about the draft ready to be presented in Parliament, he said, "we say bring any draft but eliminate corruption
" hajaare vidheyak ke masaude main shikaayat nivaaran pranali ke kendriyakaran ke praavdhaan ke bhi virodh main hai
 He said, you have to go to Delhi to get a ration card made
 unhone kaha ki uttarakhand sarkaar ek acha lokayukta vidheyak laai he
 Meanwhile, Team Anna scored 3 for MMRDA ground
 5 lakh rupee prati din ke kiraaye ko atyadhik bataate hue buudhvaar ko maamle main pradesh sarkaar se hastkshep kii maang kii or kaha ki yadi yah mudda sauhadrrpurn tareeke se nahin sulajhaa to ve adaalat main ja sakate hai
 Mayank Gandhi, a member of Team Anna's core committee, said, "we have asked the Chief Minister and Mumbai Police Commissioner to tell us where to sit (on hunger strike)
" ham itani atyadhik keemat nahin chukaa sakate
 We do not have this much money
 anna hajaare kaa andolan chalaa rahe sanghathan india against karpshan kii mumbai ikai ke sanyojak prafull vora ne kaha, hamaare kanoonee salaahkaar hamen ucch nyaayalay main ek rit yachika daakhil karne kaa suzav de rahe hai kyonki hamaara sanghathan vyavsaayik nahin he
 He said, we can file the petition tomorrow or the day after
 mayank gandhi ne kaha ki team anna ne aaazaad maidan main anshan kii yojana banaai thi lekin hamase bandra
 Asked to perform at MMRDA ground at Kurla Complex
 vora ne kaha, yadi sarkaar chaahati he ki ham mrdie main pradarshan karen to use kharch uthaanaa chahie
 He said, it has hurt us and all Indians who are protesting in democracy
 hamen paanch din ke liye 17 lakh rupee kaa bhugtan karnaa he jisamen rifundable raashi shaamil he
 Mayank Gandhi said that if the token amount was asked for Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 like Ramlila Maidan, then we had no problem
 anna hajaare ne kal kaha tha ki vah 27 disambar se teen din anshan karenge or uske baad teen din tak jail baro andolan chalaaya jayega
 The IAC yesterday wrote a letter to Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, demanding exemption from the rent
 iasi ke prafull vora ne chavaan ko likhe patr main kaha, hamen yah jaanakar hairat hui ki (mrdie maidan kii) pratidin kii ausat laagat kareeb do lakh rupee hogi
 Therefore we request you to waive the entire fee or provide some financial relief
 vora ne apane patr main likhaa he, nagarikon ko loktantric tareeke se unki jaruraton ke liye pradarshan karne dena sarkaar kii jimmedaari he
 There is no doubt that a large number of citizens will participate in the fast and come there
 iske maddenjar hamen mrdie ke maidan kaa jayja lene kaa suzav diya gaya
 Because there is enough space for people from all over Maharashtra and India
 sanghathan ne yah bhi kaha he ki vah bina laabh vaala sanghathan he or janata ke liye kaam kar rahaa he
 According to the letter, we do not allow advertisements of any kind or promotion of any commercial product or service
 puraa uddeshy rashtrahit main vyavastha main sudhaaron ke liye sangharsh karne kaa he
 Vora said, if huge cost waiver is not possible from MMRDA, then we request that adequate arrangements should be made to attend the fast of Annaji from 27 December at Azad Maidan
 hamaara maananaa he ki 50 hajaar se ek lakh log har din aana chahenge
 Sukhbir Singh Badalparty became unanimously President of Shiromani Akali Dal
 On the 99th Foundation Day special event was organized
 Sukhbir Singh Badal has once again been unanimously elected as President of Shiromani Akali Dal
 57 saal ke sukhbir singh badal lagaataar teesri baar party ke adhyaksh bane hai
 Senior party leader Tota Singh proposed his name
 jiske baad party ke anya varisht netaa prem singh chandumarja ne bhi apni sahmati di
 While Jagmeet Singh Brar carried the name forward
 amritsar main esajipisi ke mukhyalay teja singh samudri haal main shanivaar ko party ke 99wein foundation de par vishesh kaarykram kaa aayojan kiya gaya tha
 Where about 600 party workers from Punjab and other states arrived
 jiske baad sabhi netaaon ne sahmati se sukhbir badal ko shiromani akali dal kaa adhyaksh chunaa
 Former Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal could not attend the program due to health reasons
 haalanki is bich shiromani akali dal ke vidhayak or purv vitt mantri parminder singh dhindsa jaanboojh kar is kaarykram main nahin pahunche
 Parminder Singh Dhindsa is the son of rebel Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa
 pakistan ke ghazal gayak gulam ali kaa kaarykram lakhanu main hone ko lekar akhilesh yadav sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue shivasena ne uttar pradesh ko 'islamic rajya' ke rup main pesh kiya or aarope lagaaya ki rajya sarkaar ne tushtikaran kii raajnneeti ke liye 'raashtra virdohi kaarobaar' shuru kar diya he
 The Shiv Sena also took a dig at its ally BJP, accusing it of being a 'mute spectator' on these developments
 party ne maang kii he ki jin logon ne kaarykram kii anumati di he, unke khilaafrashtra virdohi gatividhiyonke liye mukadmaa chalaanaa chahie
 The Yadav family playing the politics of appeasement said in the editorial of Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, "the Islamic Yadav government has said that Ghulam Ali has been invited to perform programs to promote hindu-muslim unity
" lekin ekta ko protsaahit karne ke liye kisi ko keval pakistani kalakaaron kii kya jarurat he
 There are excellent Muslim artists in our country who are also very famous
 ' isamen kaha gaya he ki aane vaale vidhansabha chunaav ko dhyaan main rakhte hueyadav sarkaarne tushtikaran kii raajnneeti khelte hue raashtra virdohi kaarobaar shuru kar diya he
 'yadav can also call Hafiz Saeed', while targeting the Uttar Pradesh government, the Shiv Sena editorial said that Uttar Pradesh is a mine of artists but Yadav (samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh) is only interested in Pakistan's coal
 isamen aage kaha gaya he ki yadav kal coalpsankhyak tushtikaranke tahat hafiz said ko aamantrit kar sakate hai
 "those who think that the Pathankot terror attack should be forgotten and let Ghulam Ali come to India to present the program are traitors," the editorial said
 agar gulam ali ko shahid javaanon ke pariwaron kii pidaa ke bich kaarykram karne aane kii anumati di gai to iske liye jo log bhi jimmedaar hai, unke khilaaf raashtra virdohi gatividhi ke tahat mukadmaa chalaanaa chahie
 Taking a jibe at the 'BJP became a mute spectator', the Shiv Sena sought to know why the party, which won 71 seats in the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh, remains mute spectator about Ghulam Ali's program
 isamen kaha gaya he ki yah vidambnaa he ki ek taraf iesas bharat sarkaar ke liye pareshaani khadi kar rahaa he to duusari taraf yadav ne uttarapradesh ko 'islamic rajya' bana diya he or gulam ali kaa swaagat kar rahe hai
 Businessman Ratul Puri has moved the CBI court in the money laundering case related to the agustawestland deal scam
 ratul puri ne apane khilaaf jari gaiyr-jamaanti warrant ko radd karne kii maang kii he
 Puri has stated that he wants to join the investigation and therefore the warrant should be canceled
 maamle kii sunwaayee shanivaar ko kii jaaegi
 Please tell that Ratul Puri is the nephew of the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath
 bataa den ki dilli ucch nyaayalay ne buudhvaar ko pravartan nideshaalay (idi) se madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri kamalnath ke bhattije ratul puri dwaara daayar yachika par sunwaayee ke liye pratikriya maangi
 Ratul Puri has already challenged the trial court's decision for his anticipatory bail
 nyaayamurti sunil goud ne agency se ek halafname ke saath pratikriya daayar karne ko kaha tha
 On Wednesday, the court asked the agency to explain the developments in the case
 is dauraan adaalat ne idi se poocha ki puri ko hiraasat main lekar kii jane vaali poochtacha kaa kya kaaran he
 Apart from this, questions were also asked from the ED about the property details attached by the Income Tax Department
 sunwaayee ke dauraan puri ke vakil abhishek manu singhvi ne tark diya, 'maine bayaan ke 107 prishth die hai
 You describe a company's assets as benami
 ' vahiin atirikt solicytor general aman lekhi ne kaha, 'iskar vibhaag kya karata he, ham iske liye kaise jimmedaar hai? haalanki, ham iske bare main apane jawaab main likhenge
 The case is at a critical juncture and interim custody should not be granted
 'iskar vibhaag ne kathith taur par benami lenden (nishedh) adhinium, 1988 ke tahat puri or unke pita deepak puri se sambandhit ek sampatti sanlagn kii he
 Puri on Tuesday challenged the trial court's order dismissing his anticipatory bail in the money laundering case related to the agustawestland case in the Delhi High Court
 idi ne 9 agast ko puri dwaara maamle main sahyog nahin karne kaa aarope lagaate hue unhen gaiyr-jamaanti warrant jari kiya gaya tha
 Special CBI Judge Arvind Kumar allowed Puri to issue a non-bailable warrant as an application filed by the Enforcement Directorate
 iske baad adaalat ne pichley hafte puri dwaara daayar kii gai agrim jamaanat yachika ko khaarij kar diya tha
 Ratul Puri, through his companies, is under investigation by investigating agencies for allegedly receiving bribes in the agustawestland deal
 america ke los angelis main rahane vaale bhartiya actor kunal nayyar sibies ke hit tivi dharawahik da big baing theory main scientist raaj kuutharapalli kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahe hai
 When he hit a fan in the restaurant recently, he quickly put the same familiar wish, "O my God, Raj Big Bang Theory, can i take a photo?" Kunal pointed to the problem Did: Both were standing side-by-side in the washroom but this fan didn't care
 usne apana phone nikaala or clic kar diya
 Kunal laughingly told, "I think when someone takes your picture in urinal, understand that you are very famous
 ”sitambar main america ke log raaj or unke jaise kai bharatiyon se rou-ba-rou honge
 a number of Indian actors and characters will be seen in the new season of many well-known television shows in America
 kya raaj ne sharaab pie bina kisi aurat se baat na kar paane kii apni kamajori se nijaat paa lee he?kya dow
 Mindy Lahiri to get her Mr
 Right? Will Kalinda Sharma's new love be man or woman? Who would be interested in the new odd-poor indian-american named Tom Haverford's business rent-a-swag? a flood of speculation about all these questions proves how much Indian characters are being liked by many of the hit shows 
 mindi calling ke hansaane ke hunar kii da offis main jamkar tarif hui or ab unka apana sho da mindi project fox par aa rahaa he
 Standup comedian Aziz Ansari impressed the writers of Parks and Recreation so much that he wrote a character for her only to get her on the NBC show
 reshma shetty uese network par royal pens main apana shabaab bikherti hai
 british-indian actress Archie Punjabi has won an Emmy for her role in the CBS drama The Good Wife
 unke hi jaise dev patel echbio ke da newsroom main najar aate hai
 Hanna Simone, who has Indian roots, plays the lead character's best friend in Fox's sitcom New Girl
 bhartiya mul ke anya kalakaaron main adheer kalyaan or danni pudi ke naam bhi shaamil hai jinke kaam ko rules of angesement or community jaise sho main kaaphi saraahaa gaya he
 Indian-origin actors are not new to American television
 house main kaal pen, lost main naveen andrews or senthil ramamurti hiroj main kuch taaja misaalen hai
 But the new actors are more high profile than them
 isaki ek vajah to yah he ki america main bhartiya samudaay zyada dikhne laga he
 Kunal says, "go to a super market, law company or doctor's clinic, you will definitely see Indians there because now we are part of this culture
" ”televijan industry bhi is sachaai se acchhee tarah waakif he
 "all networks, studios and different types of people are on the show," says Bela Bazaria, executive vice president of nbc's Universal Television and head of the studio's hit shows Parks and Recreation, The Mindy Project and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit
 Putting different kinds of things, they say that the world looks like this now and that is why we have to show such a world in the show which is more like real life Da is close
 ”america ke televijan sho main ek ore jahaan bhartiya actor zyada dikhne lage hai vahiin unke role da simpsans main store ke maalik appu nahasaapimapetilon jaise ghise-pite kirdaaron se bahut alag ho gaye hai
 They have also managed to avoid the outdated role of a doctor or taxi driver
 kunal kaa raaj kuutharapalli caltech main saamaajik rup se thodaa ajibo-garib estrophygicist he; shetty kii divya katdere neuyork ke paas sambhraant hamptns main practice karne vaale doctor kii assistant hai; ansaari kaa kirdaar muslim bhartiya america kaa he jo sarkari adhikari he, jisane apana naam badalakar rajnatik drushti se zyada hajam hone laayak tom haverford rakh liya he;punjabi kalinda sharma hai jo sanakee or sex ke lihaaj se rahasy samete hue jasoos kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahi hai; da newsroom ke patel blogar nil sanpat hai; to simon bhartiya america model sisi mayers ke role main hai or kalinga da mindi project main obstetrician / gainicologist ke role main hai
 It is a coincidence that their character is according to the culture
 da mindi project ko televijan par prasaarit karaane main mukhya bhoomika nibhaane vaali bajaaria kaa kahana he, ''mindi he to bhartiya, lekin vastav main vah brijet jones (ek kaalpanik paatr, jise british lekhika helen fielding ne gadha he) he
 This show is not about anyone being Indian
 sanyogvash vah bhartiya he
 "reshma feels that the same thing applies to Divya of Royal Pains," she is on the show because of what she is
 bhartiya hona sanyog he, jarurat nahin
 "his background gives viewers a glimpse of a culture he is not well aware of," explains executive producer Michael Rausch
 uski ulajhanein puri tarah bhartiya he lekin ve bhi aksar universal bhi ho jaati hai
 "the indian-american community has established itself so well that the current generation of American television writers often interact with Indian children in schools
 royal pens ke ek or agxcutive prodeusar andrew lencheski ne bataaya, ''divya kaa kirdaar meri bachapan kii dost se prerit he, jo hameshaa apni hasaraton or paramparaon ke bich fansi rahati thi
 For a character in this world of Hamptons, this seems like a very intense internal conflict
 ” lekhak bhartiya-america samudaay se itani acchhee tarah parichit hai or unke saath itane sahaj hai ki atishyokti kii jarurat mahasoos nahin karte
 Kunal says, "I like to play the character in Big Bang and its writers because they make fun of Jews, whitetails, black Indians, Americans, everyone
" ”haalanki aajkal kai sho main dheron bhartiya kirdaar darshakon or aalochakon donon ko bahut pasand aa rahe hai, phir bhi sirf mindi ko hi lead role mila he
 That too when she writes and produces her own show
 ab jab nae sho bhartiya lekhak likh rahe hai to yah sthiti bhi jaldi badal sakati he
 Bazaria's studio is now working on two such shows (one by Aseem Batra and the other of Sanjay Shah) based on his own experiences in an indian-american family
 agar ye sho bane to inamen bhartiya kirdaaron ko zyada ahmiyat milane vaali he
 Bazaria is the first Indian official of a major American television studio
 unka maananaa he ki darshak bhartiya kirdaaron ko mukhyadhara kaa ang maanane ko taiyaar hai
 He says, "just like Cosby and the Jefferson dynasties were mainstream hits at a time, there will definitely be a time when Indian shows will do the same
" ”unka ishaara da cosby sho or da jeffrasans naam ke kaamyaab sitcoms kii ore tha jinamein 1970 ke dashak ke madhya se lekar 1990 ke dashak ke shuru tak africa-america kirdaar dikhaae gaye
 Looking at the current characters and the characters waiting behind, it seems that the indian-american community, which accounts for only about one percent of the American population, has happily knocked on the small screen in a large proportion

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has to amend the law in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament to implement the country's largest economic reform goods and services tax (GST) from 1 April 2016
 vipaksh main baithi congress ne GST sanshodhan vidheyak main aise badlaavon kii maang kii he jisase mana ja rahaa he ki kendra sarkaar ke liye is vidheyak ko sansad se paas kara paanaa mushkil hi nahin naammumkin ho gaya he
 Apart from the difficulties faced in the GST amendment bill, the Lalit Modi controversy in the monsoon session and the Vyapam scam of Madhya Pradesh are also a tough challenge for the central government
 in maddon ke chalate bhi modi sarkaar ke kai ahm kanoonee sudhaaron ko lanbaa intjaar karnaa pad saktaa he
 GST will not be applicable from 1 April 2016 due to these five reasons
 vipaksh main baithicongress GST bill ke virodh main nahinhai lekin uski sahmati kuch sharton par he
 She wants the proposed amendment bill to remove the proposed provision of levying 1 per cent tax on trade between states
 iske saath hi congress maang kar rahi he ki GST kii prastaavit dar ko 26 fisadi se kam karke 18 fisadi kar diya jaae
 The Congress also wants liquor, petroleum and electricity to be included in the GST
 saath hi vah puraane bill main kansaltative maikenism ko dobaaraa shaamil karne kii maang kar rahi he
 Therefore, the demands of the Congress to pass this bill in the monsoon session will have to be accepted, because this bill cannot be passed without the Congress according to the number
 2
 The amendment of the constitution for GST is only the first step
 GST kanoon banane ke baad ise lagu karaane ke liye samvidhan ke kai hisson main jaruri sanshodhan karne honge
 For this, approval of both the houses of Parliament will have to be taken once again and a round of intensive dialogue will take place between all the parties
 3
 At present, all the states have their own VAT (value Added Tax) Act, which will become a process to remove the states after the GST law is enacted
 iske saath hi rajyon main puraane tex dhaanche ko hataane aurane GST dhancheko sthapit karne ke bich ke samay main tex sambandhit maamalon ko hal karne ke liye praavdhaan banaae jaaenge
 4
 rajyon main kisi kanoon ko paas karaane main kai adchanon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 All laws made at the center are made in English
 rajyon se paas karaane ke liye unhen rajyon kii bhashaa main anuwaad karaayaa jayega jiske baad hi nae kanoon ko notifai karne kii prakriya shuru hogi
 This whole process takes a lot of time
 5
 To work under the new GST, trade and industry across the country will have to invest in the IT sector
 iske saath hi nae tex dhaanche ke sabhi stekholders ko GST prabhavi karne ke pehle shikshit karnaa hoga

Jai ho! @karthikkingsunited @suresh_kingsunited @aryadanceacademy # donaldtrump # inaugrationa photo posted by Manasvi (@manasvimamgai) onjan 19, 2017 at 1:16am PST Discussions are hot about who made the list of BJP candidates in Rajasthan
 suchi main vasundhara raaje kii chali he yaa phir sangh kii isko lekar tarah-tarah ke kayaas lagaae ja rahe hai
 All kinds of discussions are taking place in the BJP due to the veto of top BJP leaders on the ticket of Yunus Khan, the minister closest to Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje
 rajasthan main vasundhara sarkaar main 2-2 baari-bharkam mantralay peedblyoody or parivahan vibhaag sanbhaalane vaale younus khan kaa naam bijepi ke 131 ummidavaaron kii pehali suchi se gaayab he
 With Younus Khan not getting tickets, it is believed that this time the BJP will contest the election without any Muslim face
 yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki sangh nahin chahta ki nagaur main koi muslim pratyaashee utre, yahi vajah he ki nagaur se 5 baar ke vidhayak rahe habiburrahman kaa tikat kaat diya gaya or nagaur ke deedwanaa se mantri younus khan ke tikat kaa elaan roak diya gaya
 Talking to Aaj Tak, Younis Khan said that he showed patriotism in association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh since the time of Ram Mandir movement and was a disciplined BJP worker and soldier on every occasion
 aise main wo party netritv ke aakhri faisle kaa intjaar karenge or mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje ne bhi kaha he ki tikat ke liye chintaa mat karo
 Also Read: Rajasthan: Will BJP Play Hindutva Card? What is missing is Yunus Khan's stature in the Muslim Chehrarajasthan government was so large that many other ministers and legislators used to tease him
 pradhanmantri narendra modi kii raily ho yaa amit shah kii sabha puure rajasthan main pradhanmantri modi se lekar amit shah kii sabhaaon kaa jimmaa younus khan hi sambhalate the
 Younus Khan said that he had a relationship with the BJP since the time of former Vice President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and he had learned politics under Vasundhara Raje's patronage
 chaar baar unhen bijepi se tikat mila he
 In such a situation, you are explaining to your supporters, do not be sad and wait for the party's decision
 younus khan ke ghar par badi sankhya main unke samarthak baithe hue hai
 Today Yunus Khan stayed with Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje for the whole day

 lekin uski garibi ne, uske abhaav ne, use is tarah maanja ki vah 85 fisadi ank le ai
 This is the story of Shalini of Bengaluru
 warangal ke suresh kii kahani or maarmik he
 The father committed suicide last year under pressure from bad crops and debt
 bete-beti ko padhai chhodani padi
 NDTV showed the story, helped everyone, and the family stood up
 suresh ne dasvin main 87 fisadi ank hasil kiye hai
 What is the lesson of these stories? There are those who have been told that the unknowable - that suffering is suffering, poverty and scarcity give strength many times more than the human being breaks
 duusari baat ye ki samaaj saath de to toote hue log khadey ho sakate hai
 They walk with us
 tippaniyan But there is also a third thing - which these stories do not tell
 logon kii zindagi main itane abhaav, itani garibi kyon he? is sawaal kaa ham saamana nahin karte
 This prevents eye contact
 ye hamaari khaati-piti adhai hui duniya bas apni tasalli ke liye sangharshon ke bich kamyaabi kii kuch kahaniyaan chun leti hai- bataati hai ki halaat kaise bhi hon, insaan aage bad saktaa he
 But who creates a situation in which a child is forced to study on the stairs and the other girl leaves college after the suicide of her father? Boys and girls like Suresh and Shalini, these stars who like Kundan in the midst of conflict, do not really cherish their lives - they also reduce the burden of our conscience - we should probably thank them for this

 in kahaniyon kaa sabak kya he? ek to jo agyeya bataa gaye hai- ki dukh maanjata he, garibi or abhaav insaan ko jitna todate hai, usase zyaada kai baar taaqat de jate hai
 Secondly, if the society supports, the broken people can stand up
 ve hamaare saath chal padate hai
 The comments lekin ek teesri baat bhi he- jo ye kahaniyaan nahin bataati hai
 Why is there so much deprivation and so much poverty in people's lives? We do not face this question
 isse aankh milaane se bachate hai
 This we-eat-a-thriving world simply chooses a few stories of success in the midst of struggles for its well-being - tells us that no matter what the situation, a human being can move forward
 lekin aise halaat banaata koun he jisamen ek bacchee sidhiyon par padhane ko majaboor hoti he or duusari ladki apane pita kii khudakushi ke baad college chhod detii he? suresh or shalini jaise ladke-ladkiyaan, sangharsh ke bich kundan kii tarah tapane vaale ye sitare darasal apni zindagi hi nahin sanvaarte- hamaari antaratma kaa boj bhi kuch kam karte hai- hamen shaayad is baat ke liye bhi inkaa shukraguzaar hona chahie

 Devendra Sharma said that today the country is being advocated to completely eliminate the system of minimum support price
 haalanki jarurat he ki iskaa vistaar kiya jaae or zyada se zyada kisaanon ko iske daayre main laayaa jaae

 devendra sharma ne kaha ki maahaul banaaya ja rahaa he ki kisaanon ko nunatam samarthan mulya kii bajaay bazaar unke upaj kaa acha mulya degaa
 He raised the question that if this happens, then 94 percent of the farmers who are not getting MSP, why are they in trouble? Devendra Sharma said that if the basic salary and dearness allowance were to be talked about, then in 45 years the income of the farmer increased by only 19 times
 While the income of the teacher has increased from 280 to 320 times and the income of the professor from 150 to 170 times

 unhone kaha ki agar kisaan paraali nahin jalaayenge, to koi rasta to nikaaliye
 VM Singh said that today the farmer is so compelled that he wants to burn stubble in the field even after paying the fine, because it is cheaper for him
 unhone kaha ki ham kisaan kii jholii kya bharenge, unhen unka haq bhi nahin de paa rahe hai
 VM Singh said that every farmer is living a life of debt
 viem singh ne behad dukhi hokar kaha ki kisaan apni beti kii shaadi kisaan se nahin karnaa chahta he, wo chaparasi ke saath uski shaadi karne ko taiyaar he
