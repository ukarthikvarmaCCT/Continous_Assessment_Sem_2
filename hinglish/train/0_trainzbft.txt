 Police are interrogating Congress MLA Janardan Chandurkar from suburban Bandra area in connection with allegations of money splitting among them to woo voters
 police kii padtaal jaritisri baar vidhayak chandurkar bandra (purvi) nirvachan kshetra se maidan main hai
 Activists of the rival party Shiv Sena allege that they were distributing money to woo voters
 iske saath hi aarope lagaaya gaya he ki unke vaahan main noton ke bandal the
 Police said that she is making inquiries regarding these allegations
 maharashtra kii 288 vidhansabha siton par voting shuruchunaav main 3,237 ummidavaar aajamaa rahe kismatmaharashtra vidhansabha chunaav ke liye somvaar ko chaak chauband suraksha ke bich voting shuru ho gai
 In this election, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has a challenge to save his power, then the opposition Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have to come back to power again
 is chunaav main ek ore bhartiya janata party (bijepi) or shivasena ne haath mila liya he, to duusari ore congress or ensipi milakar chunaa lard rahe hai
 Therefore, the election in Maharashtra has become a bjp-shiv Sena alliance vs
 congress-ncp alliance
 fadanvis sarkaar ne maratha aarakshan, kisaan karjamaafee, sushasan or anuchhed 370 ko hataane ko apana chunavi mudda banaaya, jabaki vipakshi dal berogari, kisaan aatmahatya, buniyadi dhaancha, audyogic kshetra main ghaataa or aarthikmandi ko mudda banaakar bijepi-shivasena sarkaar ko gherne kii koshish kii
 Apart from this, the cutting of trees in Aarey Colony of Mumbai became a sore throat of the Fadnavis government
 isko lekar fadanvis sarkaar ko paryaavaran samarthakon ke kade virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue of unemployment, demonetisation, GST and Nirav Modi vigorously in his election rallies
 unhone modi sarkaar par nishaanaa sadhate hue yahaan tak kaha ki chand par rocket bhejne se maharashtra or desh ke yuva ke pet me khaanaa nahin jayega
 If we come here, we will not promise about the moon
 ham rojgaar or vikaas kaa vaada karenge, jo ham puraa kar sakate hai
 If seen in the entire election, the Congress seemed to avoid raising the issue of 370
 haalanki bijepi ne isko jorshor se uthaaya
 Apart from this, Maharashtra BJP also promised to demand the Central Government to get Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar
 iske alaava ensipi adhyaksh sharad pavaar ne buniyadi dhaanche, audyogic kshetra kaa ghaataa, berojgaare, shiksha kii sthiti or aarthikmandi ke muddon ko uthaane kii koshish kii
 It also said that by raising the issue of removing Article 370, BJP is trying to divert the attention of the general public from issues like unemployment and economic crisis
 agar is baar ke chunaav prachaar par najar daalaa jaae, to maratha aarakshan, aarthikmandi, anuchhed 370, kisaan aatmahatya, kisaan karjamaafee, piemasi bank ghotaalaa, mumbai ke aare main pedo kii kataai or rojgaar ke muddon par jamkar charchaa hui
 Now when people go to vote, these things will definitely remain in their minds
 maharashtra main kitne voter, kitne pratyaashee?aapako bataa den ki aaj maharashtra kii 288 vidhansabha siton par matdaan ho rahe hai
 a total of 3,237 candidates are trying their luck in these seats
 isamen se 235 mahila pratyaashee hai, jabaki 3,001 purush pratyaashee hai
 Apart from this, a third gender is also in the fray
 voting ke liye 96 hajaar 661 poling booth banaae gaye hai
 a total of 8 crore 97 lakh 22 thousand 19 voters will use their franchise
 is chunaav main bijepi, shivasena, congress, ensipi, bispi, sipiai or sipiiem samet anya raajnneetik dalon ne apane pratyaashee utaare hai
 BJP has fielded candidates for 164, Congress 147, Shiv Sena 126, NCP 121, MNS 101 and BSP 262 seats

 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke sabase pracheen shahar 'mohanjodaado' ke bare main logon ke bich alag-alag dharanaen hai
 The old remains found in the excavation of this world heritage reveal different things about the city, which has been given by producer Ashutosh Gowariker in the form of his upcoming film 'mohenjodaro'
 12 agast ko relies hone ja rahi is film main mukhya bhoomika main rithik roshan hai
 He shared many important things about the film and this ancient city in a special conversation
 'mohanjodaado' ke bare main rithik kehete hai, 'is shahar ke bare main koi aitihaasik pramaan nahin he
 People have come to know about this place from the excavated antiquities
 khudaai main alag-alag tarah kii chijen saamne ain, jiske aadhaar par samaaj main alag-alag dharanaen baniin
 'of all these assumptions, how was the most correct and accurate assumption chosen? On this question, he said, 'with the help of Ashutoshne research and archaeologists, one of these assumptions has been selected and made a film based on it
 'kuch aisa hi film 'jodha akbar' main bhi dekhne ko mila tha, jab ashutosh goarikar ne is par film banane kaa faisla kiya tha or baad main film ko virodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 However, Hrithik says, "if after watching the film someone said that 'mohenjodaro' did not have it all and what has been shown is wrong, then there is no evidence to prove it wrong
 'rithik ne 'jodha akbar' ke baad duusari barashutosh goarikarke saath kaam kiya he
 On his experience working with him, he says, 'I have worked with Ashutosh in jodha-akbar
 us film ke dauraan ham dost ban rahe the, lekin yah film shuru karne se pehle hi ham dost ban chuke hai to ab ham donon ke bich ek samaj ban gai he
 Surely this time is more fun
 'rithik is film ke romance ko isaki euaspy bataate hue kehete hai, 'ashutosh ke saath mjedaar baat yah he ki vah romance ko parde par badi khubsuurati ke saath utaarte hai
 Which magic a
 aar
 Rahman does music, just like magic Ashutosh does with romance
 'ashutosh kii filmon main romance kii ek khaas jagah hoti he
 In this film, old-fashioned love is shown
 rithik kehete hai, 'is film kii khaas baat iskaa puraane jamaane vaala romance he jo aajkal kii filmon main dekhne ko nahin miltaa
 Away from mobile, Snapchat and Skype, it would be interesting to see it once again on screen in the era of slow love
 'rithik film main apane kirdaar ke bare main bataate hue kehete hai, 'main film main saraman naam ke aadmi kaa kirdaar nibhaa rahaa hum, jo nil kii kheti karata he or bazaar main nil bechata he
 Blue is also my favorite color, so it was easy to connect with this character
 'rithik ke bare main aksar yah sunne main aata he ki vah kisi bhi film ke liye aasaani se 'haa' nahin karte
 Hrithik told this thing, 'I believe that the script of the film should be such that after reading, you do not have to think
 mohanjodaado kii script itani behtareen he ki maine ise shuruyaat se ant tak bina ruke ek saath pard daalaa tha
 The film is full of action scenes
 iske liye rithik ne vishesh training bhi lee he
 He says, 'the film has a lot of raw action
 ection kaa naam sunate hi meri body main 'krish' or 'dhooma' ke ection aane lagate hai
 The action of this film was quite challenging
 isaki ek vajah yah thi ki film kii shooting bhuj main kadak dhoop main hui he
 Like his father Rakesh Roshan and other actors, Hrithik says about trying his hand in the direction of direction, "right now i don't know if i have the skills to direct or not
" abhi mujhe kuch aisa mahasoos nahin hua he, agar bhavishya main aisa kuch hota he to jarur use shiddat ke saath karuunga

 It's a freaking free fall! adhiktar kaamkaaji mahilaon ko aisa lagata he ki garbhvatee hone se unki naukari ko khatra ho saktaa he
 They can be expelled from work while men who become fathers often get promoted at jobs or work places
 shodhakarta kya kehete hai is bare main-shodh se jude is nishkarsh ko aplide manovigyaan ke jarnal main prakashit kiya gaya
 It confirms that women who become mothers feel that they will no longer be well received at the workplace
 florida state uniwarsity ke shodhakartaaon kaa kahana he ki yah un mahilaon par kiya gaya pehla adhyayan he, jinhen aisa mahasoos hota he ki garbhavastha ke dauraan unhen naukari se baahar nikaal diya jayega
 Assistant teacher of management Pustian Underdoll said, "we found that women experienced fewer incentives at the workplace when they disclosed their pregnancy
 "pustian aage kahati hai, " jab mahilaon ne is baat kaa zikr apane manager yaa sah-kaaryakartaaon se kiya to hamane dekha ki unhen kariyar ke kshetra main protsaahan die jane kii dar main kameen ai jabaki purushon ko protsaahit kiye jane kii dar main badhotaree hui
 "to reach the conclusion, Pustian studied two theories in depth
 pehle main yah paaya gaya ki garbhvatee mahilaon ko naukari se nikaale jane kaa dar rahata he
 In another, Pustian found that women feel this because of many changes in the field of personal life and career during pregnancy
 shodh main kuch nai baaten bataai gai hai ki garbhvatee mahilaon ke saath kaarysthal par kis tarah se pesh aana chahie
 According to Pustian, "career-related incentives towards women who become mothers should not be reduced
 iske saath hi managers ko mata or pita donon ko hi saamaajik or kariyar se judi hi sambhav sahaayta pradaan kerani chahie taaki kaam or parivaar se judi jimmedaariyon ko bakhubi nibhaane main unhen madad milen
 " film padmavat ko relies na hone dene ke liye karani sena ne lagaataar teen maheene tak virodh kiya, ab khabar ai he ki karani sena ne apana virodh waapas lete hue is film kii prashansa kii he
 It was considered the U-turn of Karni Sena
 lekin shrirajput karani sena ke pramukh lokentre singh kalvi ne in khabaron ko bebuniyaad bataaya he
 In fact, Mr
 Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena - Maharashtra's National Vice President Yogendra Singh Katar wrote a letter saying that he saw Padmavat on February 2, which depicted the heroism and sacrifice of the Rajputs very beautifully
 yah film rani padmavati kii mahanata ko samarpit he
 Amitabh congratulated for Padmavat, Deepika said - There is no scene between Rani Padmavati and Alauddin in the movie Thankyou Babais
 is film main aisa kuch nahin he jo rajput samaaj ke itihaas or bhaawanaaon ko nuksaan pahunchaae
 We are fully satisfied with this film
 isliye ham hamaara andolan / virodh bina shart waapas lete hai
 In spite of being hit, Padmavat has lost crores, this is the earnings so far
now, denying these news, Shri Rajput Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi said in a conversation with IANS, that fake fake Karni army has been created in India
 is samay isi naam se aath senaayen desh main chal rahi hai
 Kalvi said that due to not banning the film Padmavat, there has been increasing resentment among the people, due to which the BJP lost in the Rajasthan by-election
 aage bhi bhaajapa ko iskaa khamiyaja bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Pakistan defeated India and captured the Champions Trophy
 landan se lekar pakistan tak jashn kaa maahaul he
 This victory is being praised in the Pakistani media too
 par kuch ankar zyada hi jashn main dub gaye hai
 That is why an anchor who came on Bol TV forgot his dignity
 usne apane sho main kaha- fadars de par jeet kar pakistan ne sabit kar diya ki baap baap hota he or paap paap hota he
 Along with this, a Pakistani anchor even advised PM Narendra Modi to drown in full water
 modi ko diya chalanzpakistani ankar ne 'bol tivi' par prasaarit apane sho ke dauraan piem modi ko chalange de diya
 Anchor says that the water that India has blocked for Pakistan, PM Modi should be immersed in that water
 usne kaha- 'mnarendra modi ko chullu bharpani main dub janaa chahie, jo ve hamen dene se inkaar kar rahe hai
 Tanjankar did not leave Bollywood superstar Rishi Kapoor too
 usne un par tanj kasate hue kaha ki ham apane naam main kapur kaa istemaal nahin karte, ham kapur khate hai
 He said this on the statement given by Rishi Kapoor
 rishi kapur ne kaha tha ki bharat dwaara 124 ranon se haarane ke baad pakistan final main apni majboot team bhejne kii taiyaari kare
 Who is this TV anchorinka name is Aamir Liaquat
 ye 'bol tivi' main job kar rahe hai
 Earlier, he was also removed from where he was working
 bataa den ki ye vahi patrkaar hai jinhone om puri ke nidhan ko sajishan qatl bataaya or iskaa aarope bharat ke neshnal security adwiser (NSA) ajit dowaal par lagaaya tha
 He started his career in TV with PTV
 lekin unhen vahaan se baahar kar diya tha
 He says he does not have the ability to speak
 iske baad jeeyo tivi main chale gaye or vahaan 8 saal tak kaam kiya
 Many groups are celebrating in Kashmir too, issue a high alert, let us tell that in the ICC Champions Trophy, a high alert was issued in the Kashmir Valley in the wake of the match between India and Pakistan
 kisi apriy ghatana kii ashanka ko dekhte hue somvaar ko bhi suraksha balon se alert rahane ko kaha gaya he
 According to intelligence, fidayeen attacks can be carried out within 48 hours on security forces
 bataaya ja rahaa he ki bharat-pakistan ke bich hone vaale match ke dauraan yaa phir uske baad in hamalon ko anjaam diya ja saktaa he
 The IGP of Kashmir has issued these alerts based on the information of intelligence agencies
 jaankaree mili he ki srinagar ke down toun ilaake main aatankiyon kaa movement dekha gaya he
 Terrorists can carry out grenade attacks here
 saath hi surakshabalon par firing bhi kar sakate hai
 The attacks have been feared in Noorbagh, Nauhatta and Idgah areas of Srinagar
 bal hamaari khubsuurati kaa sabase ahm hissaa hote hai
 This is why women or men all love their hair a lot
 lambey, ghaney or chamakadarbalapane kii chahat har mahila kii hoti he
 But even after many attempts, growing tall remains a dream
 lekin aapako pareshaan hone kii jarurat nahin he, ham aapako kuch khastipsbata rahe hai, jinhen follow kar aap bhilambe balpa sakengi
 This is how to take care of hair-trimming - If you want to have long hair, then at least after 8 to 10 weeks, do the trimming
 trimming karaane se bal jaldi badhate hai
 Pollution and sun rays cause hair damage, causing split ends
 ye split ands baalo ko badhane se rokte hai
 Therefore, trim should be done
 trim karaane se split ands cat jate hai or bal badhane lagate hai
 Conditioning- You must have often noticed that the hair below is more dry and lifeless than the roots of the hair
 iskaa mukhya kaaran yah ki baalo ke nichle hisse ko thik tarah se poshan nahin mil paata he
 Therefore, it is very important to condition the hair, because it prevents the hair from getting damaged
 saath hi balaheldibhi banate hai
 Massage with hot oil - Massaging your hair with hot oil is the best option for hair
 healdi baalo ke liye hafte main ek baar garm tel se massage karnaa bahut jaruri hota he
 Massaging oil also provides relief from the problem of falling hair
 aap agar apane baalo ko jaldi lanbaa bananaa chaahati hai to behatar hoga ki baalo main nariyal yaa jaitun ke tel kii massage karen
 Hair comb - Hair comb is as important as oil massage
 lekin iske liye sahi kanghee kaa istemaal karnaa bhi behad jaruri he
 Blood circulation is done properly in the scalp by combing
 sone se pehle kanghee jarur karen
 This makes the roots strong and the hair too long
 ji haa, bahut jaldi hi plastic se bane note bazaar main chalane lagenge
 The Reserve Bank of India is working on this scheme so that the problem of counterfeit notes can be overcome
 ek aarthik patr ne yah khabar di he
 It is said that by next year, such plastic notes will be issued which will have better security features
 plastic ke note jari karne ke peeche ek or bada kaaran yah he ki kaagaj ke noton kii life kam hoti he
 They deteriorate quickly and cannot withstand water and moisture
 rigerv bank ne apni salanaa report main kaha he ki karency note zyada samay tak prachlan main rahen or unki life zyada hon, bank aisi vyavastha karne ja rahaa he
 In January, the bank issued a tender to print plastic notes
 rigerv bank of india ke governor raghuram rajan ne may main kaha tha ki 2015 main ye note jari kar die jaaenge
 These notes will be issued in the first five cities
 ye hai- kochi, mysore, jaipur, bhubaneshwar or shimla
 They have been chosen due to the different environments of these cities
 pehle kam raashi ke note jari honge
 Plastic notes have a quality that they do not stain quickly and do not crack quickly
 kai deshon main plastic note prachlan main hai

 wo parikshaarthiyon kii admit card ke viviran ko sudhaar kar hastakshar or muhar ke saath admit cart jari kar dete the

 -input language aane vaale somvaar yani 9 may ko ek anokhi khagoleey ghatana hone ja rahi he
 This astronomical event is Mercury transit ie Mercury transit
 9 may ko dopaher ko yekhagoleey ghatana shuru hogi
 Astronomical phenomena of Mercury transit can be seen across India
 pichhali baar ye khagoleey ghatana 2006 main hui thi
 What is Mercury transit? Mercury transit is an astronomical event in which the planet Mercury passes between the sun and the earth and all three celestial bodies are in a straight line
 aise main budh grah suraj ke gole par ek choti si kaali bindi kii tarah najar aata he
 The angular size of the planet Mercury is much less than that of the Sun, hence Mercury looks like a small black dot
 budh pargaman kii ghatana tab shuru hoti he jab budh grah kaa gola suraj ke gole ko choota hua najar aata he
 This is called the first touch of Mercury transit
 jaisehi budh grah kaa gola suraj kii chakri ke bheetar pahunch jaataa he
 This is called the second touch of Mercury transit
 iske baad budh grah kii kaali bindi suraj ke gole par aage badhati hui najar aati he
 When the sphere of the planet Mercury touches the sphere of the sun again from inside, it is called the third touch of Mercury transit
 jab budh grah kaa chota gola puri tarah se suraj ke gole ke paar ho jaataa he to ise chaturth sparsh yani chauthaa sparsh kehete hai or isi ke saath budh pargaman kii khagoleey ghatana khatm ho jaataa he
 The astronomical event of Mercury transit usually takes seven and a half hours
 budh pargaman main budh kaali bindi kii tarah kyon dikhataa he?ek shatabdi main 13-14 baar ghatit hotibudh grah suraj ke sabase paas kaa grah he
 It does not have its own light like the sun
 dharti or suraj ke bich main aane par budh kaa wo hissaa hamen dikhataa hajisapar suraj kii roshni nahin pad rahi hoti he
 Therefore, Mercury looks like black dot during transit on the bright sun
 budh pargaman ek durlabh aakashiya ghatana he
 It usually occurs 13 or 14 times in a century
 khaas baat ye he ki budh pargaman sirf or sirf may yaa november main hi hota he
 After transit in the month of November, Mercury transit takes place in the next November at an interval of 7, 13 or 33 years
 to vahiin may ke maheene main hua budh pargaman dobaaraa may ke maheene main 13 yaa 33 saal ke antaraal par hi hota he
 How to see Mercury transit? Mercury is only 158 parts of the shell of the spherical shell
 saath hi suraj kii chamak or garmi kisi ko bhi andhaa kar sakati he
 Because of this it is not easy to see Mercury transit
 budh pargaman dekhne main khaas saavdhaanee baraten nahin to aap andhe ho sakate hai
 Mercury transit can be seen by placing special solar filters on the telescope
 certyphoid solar filter or solar chashme lagaakar budh pargaman ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Do not try to look at the sun directly with the naked eye, this can cause your eyes to light up
 duniya bhar main budhpargaman kii drishyata9 may kaa budh pargaman asia ke zyaadaatar deshon (dakshin-purvi asia or japan ko chhodkar) main dekh jayega
 Astronomical phenomena of Mercury transit can be seen from most areas of Europe, Africa, Greenland, South America, North America, Arctic, North Andhra Ocean and Pacific Ocean
 budh pargaman kaa durlabh najaara shuruyaat se ant tak purv-uttar andhra mahaasaagar, dakshin amerka ke uttari hisse, arctic mahaasaagar, greenland,pashchim europe or uttari andhra mahaasaagar se dekh ja sakegaa
 Mercury transit will be seen from everywhere in India, first touch of Mercury transit in India and second touch will be seen from everywhere
 yani budh pargaman kii khagileey ghatana kii shuruyaat puure desh se dekhi jaaegi
 But the astronomical event of Buddh transit will not be visible in the end of India because the sun will set up across the country during the time of Mercury transit
 budh pargaman kii khagoleey ghatana takreeban 7 ghante 30 minute tak chalegi
 There will be different intervals to see the astronomical phenomena of Mercury transit in different parts of the country
 masalan bharat ke purvottar hisse main budh pargaman kaa najaara shuruyaat se ek ghante tak hi dekha ja sakegaa kyonki yahaan par suryaast jaldi ho jaataa he
 So on the western side of India, the sight of the astronomical event of Mercury transit will be seen for 2 hours 45 minutes after the start
 iske baad pashchim bharat main suryaast ho jayega
 Talking about the capital Delhi, an astronomical event of Mercury transit will be seen here for 2 hours and 20 minutes
 rajdhani main budh pargaman shaam 4 bajkar 41 minute par shuru hoga or ye 7 bajkar 1 minute tak suryaast hone tak dikhataa rahegaa
 Similarly, the view of Mercury transit will start in Kolkata at 4
41 pm and this view will be seen here for an interval of 1 hour 26 minutes
 mumbai main shaam 4 bajkar 41 minute se budh pargaman kaa najaara shuru hoga or suryaast tak yahaan par ye ghatana dekhi jaaegi

 ji haa, vahi shashikala natarajan jo jayalalita kaa rhite or left donon hand rahi hai
 She remained with Jayalalitha till the last time
 unase koun milegaa, koun nahin- iskaa faisla vahi karti raheen
 Talking about friendship, the names of Jayalalithaa and Sasikala also seem incomplete without each other
 inaki dosti kii yah kahani pyaar, lagaav, vaadon or phir rishton main khatas kii bhi he
 Just like a Bollywood film
 jayalalita kii 'deth mistry' par doctor kaa bayaan- organ fail hone se hui thi mautjab yah khabar ai thi kijayalalita ne do dashakonse bhi adhik tak saath nibhaa rahishashiklako party se nikaal diya he to kayaason kaa daur aarambh ho gaya tha
 Not only this, Jayalalithaa had also expelled Sasikala and her family from her house
 kahani itani nahin he
 Let's go back a little
 shashikala aisi housewif thim jo hameshaa filmon main kaam karne or sitaron jaisaa jivan jeene ke sapane dekhati thi
 Her husband r Natarajan was a public relations officer in the Tamil Nadu government
 ve us samay kuddalor jile ke colector ve es chandralekha ke kareebi the
 Chandralekha was close to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MG Ramachandran
 kursi par 'chinamma' lekin AIADMK netaaon ke dil main abhi bhi 'ammaa'chunki mjiaar aurajayalalitaki kareebi sabhi ko pataa he to ve us samayjayalalita ko raajnneetimen laa rahe the
 Sasikala, on the other hand, started shooting weddings in her locality by purchasing a video camera
 us samay unhone chandralekha se kaha ki wo jayalalita par ek video bananaa chaahati hai
 Then Chandralekha took him to Jayalalitha, then what happened became history
 jayalalita ko padaa dil kaa daura, phir CCU main bhartee, apollo ke baahar jute samarthakaindia today conklev main jayalalita ko yaad kar bhavuk huin shashikalapuri kaman shashikala ke haath meniske baad shashikala or jayalalita ke bich dosti hui, jo paravaan chadhati gai
 Jayalalithaa was left alone after the death of MGR in 1987
 mjiaar kii patni janaki ke sapotars unke khilaaf sadakon par the
 Meanwhile, he got support from Sasikala
 1991 main jab jayalalita pradesh kii mukhyamantri baniin shashikala unke saath dikhne vaala cheharaa ban chuki thim
 She used to talk to ministers instead of Jayalalithaa
 unhen order detii thim
 Jayalalithaa's niece Deepa's party name will be - All India Amma Dravida Kazhagam! It is also said that Jayalalithaa was always surrounded by the people of Sasikala's family and no one could reach her
 dhire-dhire yahi mannargudi mafia kahalaane laga kyonki shashikala mannargudi main hi janmi hai
 It is also known that Sasikala had been living with Jayalalithaa since 1989
 ve apane janm pradesh mannargudi se 40 naukar laayi thim jo jayalalita kaa puraa ghar chalaate the
 This included all kinds of jobs like meds, cooks, drivers, gardeners etc
 sanak bhari wo aadaten jinase jaya bhi nahin raheen achhuti
 
 
 Sasikala made all her family members richer by 1996 with her support
 puure pradesh main shashikala or uske parivarajanon ke laalach or phir galat tarah se paise kamaane ke kisse charchit rahe hai
 Even it was the custom to feed money to this mafia to set up enterprises in Tamil Nadu
 bina inke kuch nahin hota tha
 This was also the reason for Jayalalithaa's defeat in the 1996 state elections
 baad main jayalalita ko in baton kaa abhas hua lekin tab tak der ho chali thi
 Her health deteriorated and when she approached the doctor, it was found that she was given a very small amount of chemical substations, which contained a very small amount of arsenic
 iske badazyalalitane is brigade ko khud se dur ho jane ke liye kaha
 But again in March 2012, the distance between the two ended
 ye baat sabhi ke liye aaj bhi paheli he ki aakhir jayalalita ne shashikala ko maaf kyon kiya, aakhir kyon ve shashikala ke bina chalane main khud ko asamarth paati thim
 
 
 However, now Sasikala is ready to take over the reins of Tamil Nadu

 sachin payalat kii shaadi faruk abdulla kii beti se hui
 There is a legal provision in Jammu and Kashmir that if the girl there marries a young man from Pakistan, she can get citizenship of Jammu and Kashmir, citizenship of India on the pretext
 lekin jammu-kashmir kii ladki agar bhartiya naagarik se shaadi karti he to property kaa adhikaar vah ganvaa degi
 He does not get rights in property, nor does he get any civil rights

 People are now beginning to believe that something very big has happened, otherwise why would the Indian government tell one lie after another every day? https: / / t
 co / gr9pwoqgnz There is disappointment and anger among the people due to non-transmission of NDTV channel on DEN cable network in many parts of the country
 isi silsile main 4 april ko banraas ke lahurabir ilaake main chandrashekhar azaad park main sadbhaavna ekta manch ke binar tale shahar ke saamaajik raajnneetik sanghathanon or prabud janon ne dharna pradarshan kiya
 In this, many people expressed their views and said that shutting down a channel on a cable network for a long time is a violation of the fundamental right of the public to get information
 iske liye in logon ne lambii ladaai ladane ke saath isaki shikaayat sambandhit vibhaag main karne kii baat kahi
 The anger of the people also erupted because people from the cable network had long been demanding to start the closed broadcast of NDTV
 lekin den network enditivi channel band karne ke peeche koi vajah nahin bataa rahaa tha
 After repeated assurances, when the channel did not start, people decided to perform
 sadbhaavna ekta manch ke sadsy atahar jamaal lari ne kaha, "ham log dharna pradarshan isliye kar rahe hai ki den cabel dwaara enditivi kaa prasaaran band kar diya gaya he
 The people of Banaras and the whole of Uttar Pradesh want to know for what reason it has been closed
 kyonki ye avam he, ye janata he, use jo channel pasand he use dekhegi
 We get our rights, that's why we are protesting
 ' Another member of Sadbhavana Ekta Manch, Sanjeev Singh said, "we have taken this up here and we will take this fight forward
 uttar pradesh sarkaar ko bhi apane is manch ke dwaara gyaapan denge or ham apane is manch ke dwaara den group par mukadmaa bhi darj karaayenge
 '' dharna sthal ko binar poster se sajaayaa gaya tha jisamen press ki azaadi se lekar enditivi channel ke prasaaran ko kyon bain kiya gaya he, ye poochhate sawaal the
 These poster banners at the intersection and the protest against not being able to see any news channel, became a matter of curiosity for the people visiting
 log ruk ruk kar in bannron ke masaudon ko pard rahe the
 People involved in the demonstration are thus considering the incident to be an attack on the fourth pillar of democracy, without closing the channel without giving any reason
 yahi vajah he ki ye log ab enditivi ko dekhne ke liye duusari takanic kaa sahaara lene ki baat kah rahe hai

 report taiyaar karne vaali team kii aguai krishi activist kavita kuruganti ne kii
 His organization is named ASHA (alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture)
 team ne yavatmal jile ke kalamb or aarani blokon main jaakar kitnashkon ke prabhaav se mrit logon ke gharon main jaakar unke parijanon se baat kii
 Experts in Arni Block found that the amount of pesticides sprayed is paid accordingly
 jab china ke power spray kiraye par lekar kitnashkon kaa chhidkaav kiya jaataa he to 25 rupye prati kanistar milane vaale bhugtan main se 15 rupye chhidkaav karne vaale majdoor or 10 rupye chini power spray ke maalik ko jate hai
 Kavita Kuruganti told India Today TV, we saw that the cost of spraying pesticides is the same as other agricultural operations
 bahut se maamalon main kitnashkon kaa spray karne vaale jab duusare ke kheton main chhidkaav karte hai to ye bhi nahin jaanate ki kitni maatra main chhidkaav karnaa he or kya ye unke liye surakshit bhi he yaa nahin
 According to the poem, the workers who do such agricultural work are from Dalit and tribal families
 kuch maamalon main dekha gaya ki yuva majdoor kai kai din lagaataar alag alag rasayanon kaa chhidkaav karte rahete hai
 In the case of a person with poisonous effects, it was seen that he worked continuously for two shifts to earn 500 rupees in a day

 kisaanon ne daura karne vaale visheshgyon ko bataaya ki unhen kai khataron kaa saamana ekasaath karnaa padataa he
 For example, cotton crop is sprayed to protect it from harmful pests
 vahiin fasal badhiya dikhaai de iske liye growth pramotars (khaas rasayanon) kaa bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The Fact Finding team found that a mixture of three different pesticides was sprayed in case of one death
 jahrile prabhaav vaale maamalon main organophosphate, phenlpirajol, synthetic pirethroed, carbamets or nio-nicotinoid ke akele yaa mishran main istemaal kii baat saamne ai
 Kavita Kurganti says that the Government of India should immediately ban all pesticides that have resulted in deaths
 maharashtra sarkaar ko in kitnashkon ko rajya main bechney ke saare licenson ko tatkaal prabhaav se nirast kar dena chahie or bhavishya main aise license jari karnaa band kar dena chahie
 The Fact Finding team also demanded a comprehensive survey of the deaths from the government
 saath hi iske liye data system taiyaar kar is samasya par kaabo paane kii jarurat bhi jataai
 The report stresses that the real culprit of the deaths is the poison that is allowed to register, make and sell
 report main ye bhi kaha gaya he ki kitnashak vikreta galat salahen dene ke gunahagaar hai
 Pesticide manufacturers, pesticide regulators, health and agriculture departments as well as state and central governments are responsible

 In the last round, the election held on May 19 in Ghazipur parliamentary constituency is seen as a referendum between caste equations and development
 sapa-basapa gathbandhan ne mafia don mukhtaar ansaari ke bhai afjaal ansaari ko bispi cote se tikat diya he
 In 2004, he became an MP on the SP (samajwadi Party) ticket
 gathbandhan ne jile ke bade tabake ko jatigat ganit main feet karne kii koshish kii he, jahaan musalmaan, dalit or yadavon ko ek saath laayaa ja sake
 
 vahiin bijepi ne kendriya mantri or teen baar saansad rah chuke iaiti ejeeniyar manoj sinha ko ek baar phir ummidavaar banaaya he
 Sinha comes from Bhumihar caste
 raajnneetik dalon ke aantarik anumaan ke mutabik jile main kareeb 55 hajaar bhoomihaar voter hai, lekin iske baavjood sinha ko 2014 main teen lakh se zyada vot mili the
 In 5 years, Sinha preferred development instead of making the caste equation a weapon
 sutara bataate hai ki bijepi alaakaman ne sinha ko baliya seat kaa bhi opshan diya tha, jahaan unki jati ke 3 lakh se zyada voters hai, lekin sinha ne gajipur ko chunaa
 BJP (bharatiya Janata Party) sources say that Sinha is confident of his work and if these voters like it, it would be a better sign for his political career ahead
 duusari ore jatigat sameekaran par bharosa jataate hue gathbandhan ummidavaar afjaal ansaari chunavi bhaashanon main aksar kehete hai ki ve manoj sinha ko 2004 main do lakh se zyada vot se haraa chuke hai
 In 2004, Afzal Ansari won a major election on the SP ticket because of the Muslim Yadav equation
 afjaal ansaari ne 415687 vot paae the, jabaki bijepi ke manoj sinha ko 188910 vot mili
 Umashankar of BSP (bahujan Samaj Party) was third with 185120 votes
 bijepi ko chhodkar afjaal ansaari kai dalon jaise sipiai, samaajawaadee party or bispi ke tikat par vidhansabha or loksabhaa kaa chunaav lard chuke hai
 In 2014, Afzal Ansari contested from Ballia Lok Sabha seat and finished third there with 163943 votes
 2014 main bijepi ke tikat par manoj sinha ne sapa pratyaashee shivakanya kushvaha ko 32,452 vot se haraaya tha
 Sinha received a total of 306929 votes, while Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party candidate Kailash Yadav was third with 2,41,645 votes
 jatigat samikarnatamam raajnneetik dalon ke aantarik jatigat aankade bataate hai ki gajipur main takreeban 4 lakh yadav hai or itani hi sankhya daliton kii he
 The Muslim population is around 1
5 lakh
 yadav ke alaava anya obisi jatiyon ke voters kii sankhya bhi kareeb teen lakh he
 The number of Kshatriyas in the upper caste voters is about 2 lakhs, while the Brahmins, Bhumihars and the rest of the upper castes number about one and a half lakhs
 manoj sinha bhoomihaar jati se aate hai or gajipur sansadeey kshetra main is jati ke kareeb 55 hajaar voter hi hai
 In such a situation, Sinha is well aware that he does not fit into traditional caste figures
 lihaaja unhone 2014 kii jeet ke baad vikaas ko apana praathmik mudda banaaya
 Development issues Gazipur used to be among the most backward districts of the country till some time back
 pichley 5 saal main gajipur ke vikaas ne raajnneetik dalon kii jatigat dhruvikaran kii paaramparik samaj ko badalanaa shuru kiya he
 Manoj Sinha claims that the pan of development has begun to overwhelm the caste and this will affect the vote pattern as well
 four len vaale haive ke alaava 5 saal main ganga nadi par railway brij, medical college, sports stadium, marden railway stesan jaise kai project shuru kiye gaye hai
 Looking at the caste equations, the SP-BSP coalition candidate Afzal Ansari has the upper hand, the image of Afzal Ansari is in sharp contrast to his mafia don brother Mukhtar Ansari
 afjaal bhi ek baar sansadeey chunaav jeet chuke hai isliye unhen kam aankna kisi bhi party ke liye badi bhul ho sakati he, lekin ek pichde jile main vikaas kii raftaar dekhen to manoj sinha ko voters pasand kar sakate hai
 The biggest question is whether the people who have been tied to caste for years will seal development? selary badaye jane kii maang ko lekar chhattisgarh ke sarkari aspataalon kii norse anischitkaaleen hadtaal par hai
 The government has imposed ESMA in the state to end the strike
 haalanki iske jald khatm hone ke asaar bhi nahin dikh rahe
 The condition of the government hospital administration and the patients admitted there has deteriorated after the nurses went on an indefinite strike for the last 12 days
 kai marijon kii aspataal se chuttee kar di gai he, to kaiyon ke oparation tak taal die gaye
 Due to shortage of nurses, doctors have also reduced recruitment of new patients
 10 hajaar norse hadtaal pardusri ore, nurson ne elaan kiya he ki vosarkaarake dabaav main nahin aane vaali
 Even if they put Esma or arrest them
 gauratlab he ki naukari pakki karne or vetan bhatton main badhotaree kii maang ko lekar sarkari aspataalon kii lagbhag 10 hajaar norse hadtaal par chali gai hai
 The operation of patients has been affected the most due to the strike of nurses of all the government hospitals of the state
 jila aspataalon se lekar raipur ke sabase bade doctor bhimrao ambedkar aspataal main haddi rog ke vibhaag kii surgery ke liye marijon ko dedh se do maah tak kaa intjaar karnaa hoga
 12 days have passed for Operation Haradaal, which was postponed for 15 days
 lihaaja sabhi sarkari aspataalon kii haalat dinon din kharaab hoti ja rahi he
 In routine surgeries, the routine operation has been postponed for fifteen days
 sarkari aspataalon main keval immergency vaale oparation hi kiye ja rahe hai
 For this too, patients and their families have to make a lot of effort
 doctoron ke mutabik unhone routine vaale saare oparation taal die hai
 Doctors argue that due to the absence of nurses, it is not possible that routine and emergency operations should be carried out simultaneously
 isliye unka puraa dhyaan sirf immergency par he
 Doctors are returning patients citing the strike of nurses in government hospitals
 zyaadaatar aspataalon main ortho ke alaava general surgery, neuro surgery, plastic surgery, ianti, netra rog or gayani main marijon kii surgery kii taarikh pandrah-pandrah dinon tak badha di gai he
 Before the nurses went on strike, doctors had generally fixed surgeries for many patients, but now they are being avoided
 aspataal main nai bhartee nahirson keehadtalko dekhte hue doctor nae marijon ko naa to bhartee kii taarikh de paa rahe hai or naa hi oparation kii
 On the other hand, health department officials are also not taking any special initiative to end the strike of nurses
 haalanki mangalvaar ko bijepi ke mahasachiv kailash vijayawargeey ne party mukhyalay main sanghathan ke padaadhikariyon se hadataali karmchaariyon ke maangon ke bare main lambii charchaa kii
 Not only the operation but other services have also been affected by the nurses' strike
 marijon ko injection lagane or dawa dene ke liye nurse dhundhana pad rahaa he
 Although work is being done by trainee nurses, but all this too is proving insufficient
 rajyamen esma lagaae jane ke baavjood nurson kii hadtaal naa to khatm hui he or naa hi ve duty par lauti hai
 State Health Minister Ajay Chandrakar has appealed to the striking nurses to return to work
 hadataali nurson kii maang he ki unka vetan grad pe 2,800 rupee se badhaakar 4,600 rupee kiya jaae
 Not only this, their job should also be confirmed
 filhal esma ko kargar banane ke liye police ko sakriy kiya gaya he
 After the imposition of ESMA and declaring the strike illegal, the police can now take the protesting nurses into their custody

 Make plans in which the compensation amount is the same
 ' court ne centre sarkaar kii kaaryastylee par sawaal uthaate hue kaha ki 650 jilon main nirbhaya fund kii raashi dushkarm va yon aparaadh peedit mahilaon ko muaavja va punarvaas ke taur par kharch kii jaani thi

 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal or uparajyapal ke bich lambey samay se jari adhikaron ke takaraav ke bich supreme court ne buudhvaar ko ahm faisla sunaaya
 The court heard the important verdict, saying that the Lieutenant Governor is not free to take a decision in Delhi, LG will have to act as per the advice of the cabinet
 haalanki, court ne araajaktaa ko lekar bhi tippanee kii
 The Supreme Court said that there is no place of chaos in Delhi
 araajaktaa ko lekar supreme court kii aap par kii gai tippanee ko bijepi bhunaane main lagi he
 BJP leaders are targeting Kejriwal for this comment
 bijepi pravaktaa sambit paatra ne bhi ek press conference kii
 Sambit said, 'the Supreme Court verdict is against anarchy
 arvind kejariwal ise jeet bataakar khushi manaa rahe hai lekin lagata he unhone faisle ko thik se nahin padhaa he
 Because the court has said in its judgment that the constitution is supreme and there is no place of anarchy in the constitution
 samvidhan ke hisaab se chalanaa hoga
 'sambit Patra further said,' Arvind Kejriwal's face must have appeared when the judge is writing the verdict
 court ne kaha ki samvidhan sarvocch he yahaan anarchist (arajak) ke liye koi jagah nahin he
 Kejriwal himself has declared himself anarchist many times
 kejariwal apane tareeke se samvidhan chalaanaa chaahate hai
 Everyone knows what kind of words he has used for the Prime Minister
 'unhone kaha, 'aaj supreme court kaa jo nirnay aayaa he uske hisaab secogeriwal ko janatake liye kaam karnaa chahie
 The promises made to the people of Delhi should be fulfilled
 lekin kejariwal ne pichley saadhe teen saalon main kaam naa karne ke bahaane dhunde hai
 Sambit Patra further said that if Kejriwal is not allowed to work, then why are Kejriwal claiming that he has done a lot of work in Delhi by putting up big posters and hoardings? Leaving no stone unturned to surround it
 bijepi netaa shyaam jaju ne kaha ki, supreme court ke faisle ne samvidhan ko chunauti dene vaale mukhyamantri ko unka sthaan dikhaa diya he, or yah nirnay unke liye chetavanee he ki wo ab dilli ke bhale ke liye kaam karen
 On the other hand, MP Meenakshi Lekhi said that Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia tweets after the Supreme Court's decision in which he has said to continue the agitation for full statehood, which is a contempt of Supreme Court
 saansad ramesh bidhudi ne kaha ki dilli main beete teen saal se vikaas kaary thap hai jiskaa mul kaaran he ki sarkaar vidhi anusaar yojanaayen nahin banaati lekin aaj ke faisle ke baad ummid he ki ye tasviir badalegi
 On the matter, MP Mahesh Giri said that it is a matter of embarrassment for the Kejriwal government that the Supreme Court has commented on the chaos in its decision
 iske alaava saansad udit raaj ne kaha ki baba sahab bhimrao ambedkar ne 1952 main samvidhan ko lagu karte samay yah spasht kar diya tha ki desh kii rajdhani hone ke kaaran dilli sangh shasit pradesh rahegaa lekin apni naakaamiyon ko chhipaane kii koshish main kejariwal lagaataar is mudde ko uthaa rahe hai
 On the issue, Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Vijender Gupta said that, 'aam Aadmi Party is plotting to mislead the public about the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court
 unhone kaha ki nyaayalay ne aam aadmi party ko chetaya he ki prajatantr main araajaktaa ke liye koi sthaan nahin he
 The Honorable Court has stated that constitutional boundaries should be respected
 party ko is chetavanee se sabak lenaa chahie
 The court has also held that Delhi is a union territory and cannot be given full state status
 kejariwal ab is maang ko lekar apni vifaltaaon se dhyaan hataanaa chhod den
 He said that the decision of the Honorable Court is about constitutional and interpretations
 vipaksh ke netaa ne kaha ki bharat sarkaar dwaara 21 may, 2015 ko jari adhisuchana abhi bhi barkaraar he
 The powers conferred on the Lieutenant Governor under Article 239AA of the Constitution still exist
 isamen punah spasht kiya gaya tha ki 'lok vyavastha', 'police' or 'bhoomi' se sambandhit vishyon par uparajyapal kendra sarkaar kii shaktiyon kaa prayog or uske krityon kaa nirvaahan karegaa
 According to this, the anti-corruption Branch Police Station will not take any cognizance of the crimes against the officers and employees of the Central Government and members of the public
 yah shakha uparajyapal ke adhinsth kaam karti rahegi
 "the gimmick that Kejriwal made at the Lieutenant Governor's Office for 10 days was only to create pressure
" iske atirikt purna rajya kii maang bhi isi uddeshy kii purti ke liye thi
 But today the Supreme Court gave milk and milk of milk to a fair judgment
 aaj cabinet kii baithak main charchaa kii gai ki ab door-step rashan or sisitivi camere kii filein clear ho jaaengi
 These subjects have nothing to do with the decision of the Honorable Supreme Court
 aap sarkaar kaa daawa bebuniyaad he
 The ration file has been stuck with the Delhi government since 18 March
 sisitivi camere kii yojana ko abhi tak cabinet se sweekruti tak nahin mili he
 Vijender Gupta said that, 'with the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, there is no impact on the working and governance of the Kejriwal government
 pani, bijli, anaadhikrut coloniyon main naagarik sevaayen uplabdh karwaane, pradooshan, saarvajanik yatayaat jaise anekanek vishyon par kaary karne ke liye kisi bhi prakaar kii kabhi bhi roak nahin thi, parantu kejariwal sarkaar ne saade teen saal kaam nahin karke apni vifaltaaon par pardaa daalane kii koshish kii
 "now she is pulling a pillar like a cat cat
 vipaksh ke netaa ne kaha ki samvidhan or kanoon sarvopari hai
 Kejriwal should follow the constitution and rules
 unhone kaha ki kejariwal or unke mantri adhikariyon par galat prabhaav se kaam karwaanaa chaahate hai
 They threaten them with intimidation and want to get things done as per their choice
 ab yah sab band hona chahie
 He said that if Kejriwal still brings any proposal before the Cabinet or Vidhan Sabha without the consent of the Law Department, Financial Department, Administrative Reforms, the concerned department, then it cannot be accepted

 The first name in this race of politics above family is Lalu Prasad's elder daughter Misa Bharti

 yahi nahin, unhone tikat bantwaare main yuvaaon kii 50 fisadi hissedari kaa aashwaasan bhi diya he

 Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani has reiterated his resolve to build the Ram temple in Ayodhya, saying that a 'solution' cannot happen in his life until a grand temple is established in 'ramnagari'
 adwani ne ayodhya main yojit jansabha main kaha ki tatkaaleen congress sarkaar ko somnath mandir kii tarah ayodhya main bhi mandir ke nirmaan ke liye pahal kerani chaiye thi
 He said, 'there cannot be a solution in my political life unless a grand temple is built in the place where the idol of Lord Rama is installed
 mujhe vishwaas he ki desh main har ram bhakt chahega ki vah din jald se jald aae ki jis jagah ramalala virajman hai, vahaan mandir ban jaae
 Our efforts will continue till the Ram temple is built
 ’ adwani ne kaha ki elahabaad ucch nyaayalay kii lakhanu peeth ke sambandhit teenon nyaayadhishon ne apane nirnay main mana he ki ayodhya main jis jagah ramalala virajman hai vahi ramajanm sthal he
 He said that during the tenure of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government at the center, three solutions to the Ayodhya dispute were seen, first, there should be a BJP government at the center and the matter should be decided by Parliament
 doosraa, adaalat nirnay kare or teesraa, hindu-muslim netaa mil baithkar faisla karen
 Advani said that Hindu Muslims should sit and decide the dispute, nothing could be better
 ummid he ki doosraa or teesraa samaadhaan milakar kaam ho jayega
 This will work without any confrontation and bitterness
 duniya ke ram bhakt dekhenge ki ram mandir vahiin banegaa, jahaan unki murti he
 He has come here with this hope
 unhone kaha ki ‘somnath’ tathaa ‘pilgrimage tu freedom’ pustaken padhane ke baad unhen maaloom hua ki ram mandir nirmaan ko lekar jis tarah kii samasya paidaa hui, aisi hi samasya pandit jawahar laal nehru ke pradhanmantritv kaal main somnath ke mandir ko lekar bhi utpann hui thi
 Advani said, 'I came to know that the Central Cabinet decided to rebuild Somnath's temple which was demolished by the invaders, which was presided over by Pandit Nehru and Maulana was present at that meeting
 saath hi sardaar patel tathaa ke
 Munshi was among the pioneers to put that proposal
 ’unhone kaha, ‘himachal pradesh main jansangh kii ek baithak main prastaav paarit kiya gaya tha
 We believed that the attitude Pandit Nehru had taken regarding Somnath Temple at that time
 vahiin rukh tatkaaleen pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi ko ayodhya ke maamle main bhi apnaanaa chaiye tha
 Advani said that the Rath Yatra for the Ram temple taught him a lot
 unhone kaha, ‘adwani ne ayodhya ke liye kuch nahin kiya
 Ayodhya did a lot for me
 ayodhya ne mujhe saanskrithik rashtradharm sikhaaya
 There is no better way to awaken the country on any subject than a rath yatra
 ’adwani ne videshi bainkon main jamaa kaledhan ko bharat waapas laane par jor dete hue kaha ki agar sarkaar tathaa netaa milakar rishwat naa lene or naa hi dene evam kaledhan ko waapas laakar gaanvon kaa vikaas karne kaa sankalp len to desh kii garibi mit jaaegi
 He said that 25 lakh crore rupees of the country have been kept in foreign banks
 agar yah desh main aa jaae to desh kaa puraa nakshaa badla ja saktaa he
 The BJP leader said that this is probably the first such government which has to hear the court's scolding almost every day
 unhone kendra sarkaar kii naakaamiyaan ginate hue kaha ki ghotaalon ke kaaran duniya main hamaari itani badanaami hui he
 There were so many scams that inflation reached its peak
 vaajapeyi sarkaar ne mahangaai par niyantran rakhaa tha
 Advani said that during the BJP rule at the Center, the earthquake in Kutch and the Pokhran nuclear test did not allow inflation to rise despite US sanctions
 yah sthiti aaj isaliye nahin ho sakati kyonki sarkaar bhrashtachar ko roak nahin paa rahi he
 The minister is going to jail
 is bare main sawaal kiye jane par himachal pradesh bhaajapa adhyaksh satpal singh satti ne kaha, ‘aap log kyon is maamle ke peeche pade hue hai? yah unke (anil sharma ke) parivaar kaa maamla he
 We will see what to do
 'anil sharma ne kaha, ‘main mandi ke alaava anya siton par bhaajapa ummidavaaron ke samarthan main prachaar karne ke liye taiyaar hum
 Sharma was a minister during the Congress governments led by Virbhadra Singh in the state in 1993 and 2012 but he joined the BJP along with his father before the assembly elections in October 2017

 Bollywood rapper Badshah's new song "pagal" has set a new record on youtube
 badshaah ke gane pagal ko utyub par 24 ghante ke andar hi 7
 50 million views, which even Hollywood artist Taylor Swift has not been able to do till date
 isi ke saath badshaah ne korian boy band beaties ke april 2019 main banaae record ko tod diya he
 The funny thing is that despite breaking such a record and achieving great achievement, youtube has not given any congratulations or appreciation to youtube
 jabaki utyub ne apane plateform par sabase acha karne vaale gaanon kii saraahna kii thi
 These include songs by Ariana Grande, Thank You Next, Blackpink's Songs Kill This Love, bts's Boy With Love, and even Taylor Swift's Songs Me
 vaise is gane par record vyuj ko lekar do baaten chal rahi hai
 It is believed on Twitter that Badshah and his associates have bought views of crazy songs
 vahiin kuch kaa maananaa he ki badshaah ne google kii vigyapanon ko kharida he
 It is worth noting that many big artists buy advertisements to promote their songs
 aise main utyub par video ke bich main gane kii choti clip dikhaai jaati hai
 If viewers watch this clip for more than a few seconds, youtube counts it as one view
 ye vigyaapan kaa tarika tailor swift or blackpink ne bhi apanaaya he
 But it is believed that the emperor took it a little further
 badshaah kaa utyub par aaropis maamle main badshaah kaa kahana he ki utyub unke saath ninsaphi kar rahaa he
 youtube applauds the big international artists for their achievements, but is reluctant to mention the success of the Indian rapper
 bataa den ki badshaah bollywood ke bade raper hai
 He has sung and composed great and famous songs over the years
 badshaah kaa naam forbs kii 100 sabase amir bhartiya celibrities kii list main shaamil he
 Badshah will soon be seen acting in the Bollywood film Khandani Shafakhana

 ajtak ke panchayat gujarat kaarykram ke ahm satr alpsankhyakon ke mudde main aasamaa khan pathan, sufi mehboob ali chishti, gayasuddin shaikh or noorjahan dewan ne shirkat kii
 The session was conducted by Punya Prasun Vajpayee
 pradhanmantri modi jab gujarat ke mukhyamantri the tab unhonesadbhaavna upwasakia tha
 Sufi Mehboob Ali Chishti was responsible for the participation of all religions in this fast
 ajtak ke manch par punya prasoon ne sufi mehboob ko yaad dilaayaa ki is upwas main modi ne topi pahanane se manaa kar diya tha
 Is this the model of Gujarat? is sawaal kaa jawaab dete hue sufi mehboob ali chishti ne kaha ki topi pahananaa or pehanaanaa desh kii raajnneeti nahin he
 Bringing Muslims into the mainstream of employment is an important issue
 gujarat bijepi alpsankhyak morcha ke pradesh adhyaksh sufi mehboob ali chishti ne kaha ki topi pahananaa or topi pehanaanaa hi kya vikaas he
 What hat did Gandhi to Sardar Patel ever wear

 He tried to do his politics through cap
 aasamaa khan pathan se sawaal poocha gaya ki kya gujarat main hinduon ke ilaake main or muslimon ko hinduon ke ilaake main rahane nahin diya jaataa

 Asma said that the politics of appeasement was happening during the Congress era and this politics is the main reason for the backwardness of the Muslim society
 noorjahan dewan ne kaha ki hindu skulon main muslim bacchon ko daakhila nahin diya jaataa

 haalanki manch se gayasuddin shaikh ne daawa kiya ki upie kaarykaal main alpsankhyak bacchon ko wajipha dene kaa elaan kiya tha lekin rajya main bijepi sarkaar ne teen saal tak us wajife ko jari nahin kiya
 This ignores the Modi government's slogan of Sabka Saath and Sabka Vikas
 ek sawaal ke jawaab main shaikh ne kaha ki gujarat main aajamusalmaan samudaay sabase zyada kamaikarta he
 But the credit for his earnings is not due to the BJP government in the state
 aisa mahaj isliye sambhav ho paaya he ki gujarat main hindu or musalmaan kandhaa se kandhaa milakar kaam karte hai or isi ke chalate unhen kamai ke achche maukey mili
 Sufi said that today there is a better environment in Gujarat, people are joining BJP
 muslim panchayat se lekar nagar palika ke chunaav main jitkar aa rahe he
 Gujarat is therefore riotous, crime free
 muslim samaaj bijepi se jud rahaa he, isiilie congress baichaiyn he
 He said that there have been riots every year during the Congress era
 gujarat ke siem bacchon ke admician ke liye muslim ke daravaaje par ja rahe hai
 Asma Pathan, director of the National Waqf Development Corporation, said that the Congress has done the work of planting poison among Hindu Muslims
 2002 ke baad gujarat main ajtak koi danga nahin hua he
 But Muslims did 60 years of slavery to Congress
 modi ji ne centre main aate hi alpsankhyak mantralay kaa fund badhaayaa
 Congress MLA Gyasuddin Sheikh said that the BJP government is not providing Muslim children scholarship in Gujarat

 bihar ke mountain main dasharath maanjhi ke bare main to sabhi ne suna or padhaa he lekin odisha ke jalandhar nayak bhi dasharath maanjhi se kam nahin hai
 Nayak single-handedly made an 8-kilometer road by cutting the mountain, day and night, for two consecutive years, and the goal is to make this road another 15 kilometers
 ye road unke gaanv gumsahi ko mukhya maarg se jodta he
 Nayak's exploits are attributed to his three sons
 kabhi skool ne jane vaale nayak ne apane teen bacchon ko skool tak bhejne ke liye ye mushkil karnama kar dikhaaya, kyonki unke beton ko skool tak jane ke liye pahaad ko paar karnaa padataa tha jo kaaphi mushkil bharaa tha

 colector ne nayak ko aarthik madad dene or khand vikaas adhikari ko or majdoor lagaakar road ko puraa karaane ke nirdesh die hai

 yah kaam usne apni patni kii maut ke baad kiya, jinaki maut pahaad se girakar ho gai thi
 Please tell that the only hero's family lives in this village, the rest of the villagers have left the village due to lack of resources here

 Now that the administration has decided to honor Nayak on the Kandhamal festival, he is happy
 khushi is baat kii bhi he ki jila prashasan kii madad se gaanv tak pakki road kaa nirmaan kaary puraa kiya ja sakegaa
