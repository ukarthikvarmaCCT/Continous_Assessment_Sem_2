 unhone kaha ki piem modi skool bhi nahin jate honge, shakha main danda chalaanaa nahin siikhe hoge, tab desh ke paas itani chijen aa chuki thim
 The Congress leader, Ambani's assistant Modi government, raised questions about Hindu terrorism
 unhone kaha ki is tarah ke mudde buniyadi muddon masalan naukari, kisaan ke sankat, bank lone se logon kaa dhyaan hataane ke liye uthaae ja rahe hai
 The bank's loan crisis has increased in the BJP government
 yah sarkaar sirf dhanna sethon kii madadgaar he, modi sarkaar sirf ambani kii madadgaar he
 Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu said that Narendra Modi will drown in his wave of lies
 unhone pichhali baar 342 sankalp kiye the, jisamen se ek bhi puraa nahin hua
 Every promise he made was incomplete and false
 main modi ke khilaaf isliye bolta hum ki aane vaali peediyaan ye bolen ki jab desh barbaad ho rahaa tha to siddhu tamaasha nahin dekh rahaa tha
 He said what did you do for five years, gave a loan of 32 lakh crores
 modi ne ek bhi vachan puraa nahin kiyasiddhu bole ki modi ne ganga safai kii baat kii thi, 15 lakh laane kii baat kii thi
 90 lakh crores was said to be brought from abroad, but all lies turned out
 hindustani samskruti main kaha jaataa he ki raghukul reeti sadaa chali ai, praan jaae, par vachan na jaai
 But Modi did not fulfill any of his promises
 unhone to sari sarkari companiyon kaa haq markar nijee puunjipatiyon, amiron kii jeb main daulat daal di
 Before the Modi government came, the big capitalists had 49 percent wealth, after their government, the rich became the owner of 74 percent wealth
 desh ke 90 fisadi kisaanon ke paas 24-25 fisadi daulat rah gai he
 What a difference between the two
 maine isse bada phenku piem nahin dekhamodi ke vaadon par siddhu ne kaha ki jahir khan baayen haath se 120-130 kimi prati ghanta kii raftaar se gend phekta tha, modi usase bhi tej phenkate hai
 Also said that i have not seen a bigger throw than Prime Minister Aaj Tak
 inke kaarykaal main sarkari bainkon kaa enpie 2 lakh karod se badhkar 22 lakh karod ho gaya, chaar lakh karod rupaya to inhone sidhe amiron kaa maaf kar diya
 They are saying- Once again while the common man is saying- Just do it man
 na ram mila, na rojgaar mila, har gali main mobile vaala berozegaar melasiddhu ne kaha ki narendra modi ne kaha tha ki 2 karod rojgaar har saal duungaa, notebandi se karodon logon kii naukari chali gai
 He gave such huge contracts to Ambani, from where do these rich people manufacture them, from China
 siddhu ne kaha ki modi kii sarkaar main- na ram mila, na rojgaar mila, har gali main mobile chalaata hua ek berozegaar mila
 He alleged that Aaj Tak did not give 4G contract to the state-owned company BSNL and gave it to private companies
 sarkari company antipisi ko na dekar adani ko videshon main bijli kaa theka de diya
 Sidhu said that Modi will be known only for two schemes - Pakoda scheme for the youth, Bhagora scheme for the rich
 ab piem khud muddon se bhaag rahe hai
 Why did PM Modi contest from two seats? On Rahul Gandhi, Sidhu said that my dream is to see my leader at the height
 rahul gandhi ke amethi or vynad do siton se ladane par unhone kaha ki modi kyon do siton se chunaav lade the? unhone kaha ki rahul gandhi lagaataar piem modi ko bahes ke liye lalkaar rahe hai, lekin modi isse bhi bhaag rahe hai
 For Priyanka Gandhi, Sidhu said that she is braver than a lioness, she has not lived on a flower bed
 unako sanghathan kaa kaam diya gaya he
 She has been given the job of watering her roots, so she is not contesting elections
 fouj jang ladane ke liye he, modi ke chunaav ladane ke liye nahinsiddhu ne aage kaha ki aaj hindustan kii fouj modi kii fouj ho gai, hindustan kii fouj jang ladane ke liye he, modi ke chunaav ladane ke liye nahin he
 He further said that Modi used to say that take a pen of ten rupees, then take a sure bill, today we ask for the bill of Rafael, so why is he crying so much
 unhone piem modi ke liye kaha- aae the ganga ke laal banakar, jaaenge rafel ke dalal banakar
 Today, watch the watchman, what people say Sidhu said on Modi wave that earlier there used to be the voice of modi-modi, today just once you speak the watchman, see how the voice comes from the people
 modi ke saamne koun ke sawaal par siddhu ne kaha ki main hum modi ke saamne, rahul hai modi ke saamne, ek aam aadmi he modi ke saamne, ek jawan he modi ke saamne
 Modi was afraid of a young Teja Bahadur Yadav, got his papers canceled
 kis-kis se ghabara rahe ho
 He further said that Modi came over the news, ended the farmer, ended the small businessman, ended the big business and also ended the country
 modi taantya tope nahin jo koi unase dar jaemodi ke dar se sabhi dalon ke ekasaath aane par siddhu bole ki modi koun se taantya tope hai jo log unase dar jaaenge
 Modi himself is running away from all issues
 apane hi vaadon kaa dobaaraa zikr nahin kar paa rahe hai
 How is ability assessed, how much have you fulfilled your promises
 bataa den ki navjot singh siddhu congress main shaamil hone ke baad se hi pradhanmantri modi ko lekar hamalavar rahe hai
 He has been issued a show cause notice on the statement given against Prime Minister Narendra Modi
 chunaav ayog ne gujarat main bhartiya janata party(bhaajapa) ke ek kaaryakarta niraj kii shikaayat ke aadhaar par siddhu ko notice jari kiya he
 He alleged that Sidhu while addressing a rally in Ahmedabad on 17 April called the Prime Minister a 'thief'

 america main gaay kii aayu badhaane ke liye uske sharir main bada chhed kar diya jaataa he
 Actually, after long-term veterinary research, it has been proved that by making a big hole in the cow's body, it benefits rather than harm
 deyari udyog se jude log bataate hai ki isse gaayon kii beemaari se hone vaali asamyik maut ke maamalon main bhi kaaphi kami ai he
 You must have seen the picture and video of the hole in the body of the cows on social media many times
 aaj ham aapako iske peeche kii kahani bataa rahe hai
 It seems a bit strange to see a big hole in the cow's body, but the researchers behind it have their own logic
 unka kahana he ki gaay ke sharir main bada chhed kar dene se uske sharir ke andar kii bimariyon ko aasaani se nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Through this large hole, it is also convenient to know whether the food is digested properly in the stomach of the cow
 isse gaay ke pet main rahane vaale bacteria ke bare main bhi aasaani se pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 According to the website of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), this large hole made in the cow's body is called fistula
 vahiin sharir ke jis hisse main yah bada chhed banaaya jaataa he use rumen (rumen) kehete hai
 The comments bataaya jaataa he ki jab gaay ke sharir main chhed karne ke liye surgery kii jaati he to kareeb chah hafte tak gaay asahaj hoti he
 However, there is no possibility of any harm to the cow if skilled doctors perform this surgery
 gaay ke sharir main bada chhed karne ke baad use ek plastic kii ring se band kar diya jaataa he
 Also, the lid can be peeled into the stomach of the cow as per the desire
 kai baar gaay ke biimaar hone par uske pet main sidhe dawaai daal di jaati he
 In case of any kind of disturbance in the stomach of the cow, the veterinary doctors put their hands and clean the stomach of the cow itself
 gaay ke pet main chhed karne kii is prakriya kaa kai sanghathan virodh bhi karte hai
 Those who oppose it, are we justified in using this kind of animals only for our benefit
 aalochakon kaa ye bhi kahana he ki america main maujuud fedral animal welfare act hi ekmaatr aisa kanoon he, jo apane phaayde ke liye pashuon ke saath kiye jane vaale prayog ko roak saktaa he
 Also animals can get their rights
 haalanki kheti-baadi ke kaam main upyog hone vaale gaay par yah kanoon lagu nahin hota he
 Olchak considers this to be cruelty to cows and calls for legislation to stop it
 pipal for ithical treetment of animals (peta) kii website ke mutabik gaay ke sharir main banaaya jane vaala yah bada chhed fistula (fistula) kaha jaataa he
 At the same time, the part of the body in which this big hole is made is called Rumen
 tippaniyan It is said that when surgery is done to pierce the cow's body, the cow is uncomfortable for about six weeks
 haalanki kushal doctoron ke is surgery karne par gaay ko kisi bhi tarah ke nuksaan hone kii koi sambhaavna nahin hoti he
 After making a big hole in the cow's body, it is closed with a plastic ring
 saath hi ichha ke anusaar dhakkan hataakar gaay ke pet main jhaanka ja saktaa he
 Many times, when a cow is sick, medicine is put directly in her stomach
 gaay ke pet main kisi tareeke kii gadabadi kii sthiti main wetenry doctor haath daalkar gaay ke pet ko khud hi saaf kar lete hai
 Many organizations also oppose this process of piercing the stomach of a cow
 virodh karne waalon kaa kahana he ki kya ham keval apane phaayde ke liye pashuon ke saath is tarah kaa prayog karnaa jaij he
 Critics also say that the Federal Animal Welfare Act, which exists in the US, is the only law that can prevent the use of animals for their own benefit
 saath hi pashuon ko uskaa adhikaar mil saktaa he
 However, this law does not apply to cows used in farming
 olchak ise gaayon ke saath krurta maanate hai or ise rokane ke liye kanoon kii maang karte hai

 There is a contest between Shiv Sena and Congress on this seat
 shivasena ne yahaan se kripal tumane or congress ne kishor uttar raav ko tikat diya he
 At the same time, Bahujan Samaj Party has fielded Subhash Dharam Das
 bataa den ki ramtek loksabhaa seat shivasena ke dabadabe vaali seat he
 Here, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Kripal reached the Parliament after winning the election on a Shiv Sena ticket
 anusuchit jati varg ke liye arakshit yah seat kabhi congress kaa garh hua karti thi, lekin 1999 main shivasena ne yahaan apana khaataa kholaa
 History of the seat
 
 
 ramtek loksabhaa seat 1957 main astitv main ai thi lekin yah sabase zyada charchaa main 1984 main rahi thi
 At that time former Prime Minister P
P
 ve narsimharav yahaan se chunaav lade the
 After this, in 1989, he was successful in winning from here
 bataa den ki 1957 se lekar 1998 tak congress kaa garh rahi he
 The first Lok Sabha election here was won by Krishna Rao Gulabrao Deshmukh
 phir 1962 main madhavrao bhagwant raav patil chunaav jite
 He was followed by Amrit Ganpat Sonar twice in 1967 and 1971
 phir 1974 main ram hedu nirdaleey jite
 Barve Jatiram Chitaram won continuously in 1977 and 1980
 1984 or 1989 main ramtek kii janata ne pi

 wo pradhanmantri bhi bane
 He was followed by Tej Singh Rao of the Bhonsle Raj family in 1991, Dattatraya Raghobaji Meghe in 1996, Rani Chitralekha Bhosle in 1998
 1999 main pehali baar shivasena ko mili jitaramtek main congress ko haraakar sabase pehle 1999 main shivasena yahaan chunaav jiti
 Subodh Mohite was elected MP
 wo yahaan se 2004 main bhi jite
 But after Mohite left Shiv Sena, Prakash Jadhav of Shiv Sena won the election in the by-election held here
 is jeet ke baad bal thakare ne ramtek ko shivasena kaa garh bhi mana
 When Congress overturned

 raaj parivaar kaa koi sadsy congress party se judaa ho to rajasthan kii mukhyamantri vasundhara raaje kaa dil dukhata he
 Vasundhara Raje managed to join the former Kota royal family of Kota one night before the last day of nomination
 gauratlab he kivasundhara rajekhud dhaulpur rajpariwaar se hai
 The royal family of Kota has been associated with the Congress for a long time and former Maharaj of Kota, Ejiraj Singh has also been a Congress MP
 unke pita bhi congress party kii taraf se centre main cabinet mantri rahe hai, lekin vasundhara raaje ne inaki patni kalpana singh ko ladpura vidhansabha se bijepi kaa tikat dekar congress ke khilaaf maidan main utaar diya he
 To celebrate his success, Vasundhara Raje today reached the City Palace, the residence of the Kota Raj family, and by applying tilak, he got Ejiraj Singh and his wife Kalpana Singh to get BJP membership
 is maukey par kota ke saansad om birla bhi maujuud the
 On this occasion, Vasundhara Raje said that whenever i saw the members of the Kota Raj family that she was in the Congress, my heart ached
 kumaar ijyaraj singh ko to main apane bete dushyant kii tarah maanati hum, lekin aaj kalpana or ijyaraj ke hamaari parivaar main waapas aane se majbootee mili he or hamen khushi bhi mili he
 When Rahul Gandhi did a road show from Jhalawar to Kota, Rahul Gandhi himself used to keep Eajiraj Singh everywhere
 haalanki, ijyaraj kii ichha apni patni ko congress se ladpura se tikat dilvaanaa thi
 However, Ladpura's seat went to Guddu Naeem under minority quota
 isse naaraaz hokar ijyaraj singh ne congress kaa saath chhod diya
 There is also a discussion in Rajasthan that Vasundhara Raje, the former Princess of Jaipur, cut the ticket from Sawai Madhopur
 raaje or diya singh ke bich rajmahal hotel kii jameen ko lekar lambey samay tak vivaad chalata rahaa tha
 On getting the ticket cut, Diya Singh said that i am not angry with her because she had brought me on politics and i contested the election only at her behest
 isi tarah vasundhara raaje aaj kota main congress ke purv vidhayak or rashtriya mahila ayog ke purv adhyaksh mamata sharma ko bhi aupchaarik rup se bijepi main shaamil karavaaya
 Mamta Sharma was also given a BJP ticket from Peepalda assembly yesterday
 ye khud ke liye yaa apane bete ke liye bundi se tikat chaah rahi thim

 kuch chuta-saah dinesh pathakkathakaar dinesh pathak kaa yah doosraa upanyaas he
 And after a long time in Hindi, a novel has come out keeping Prem at the center
 chhutput tareeke se prem sambandhon ko lekar is bich kai upanyaas aae lekin naav na bandho aisi thor unase thodaa alag in arthon main he ki isamen prem or prem ke rang puri shiddat ke saath ghule-mili hai
 By the way, due to the emotional sentiment, this color of love fades and also appears gray
 bhashaa ke saath kuch atapate prayog bhi hai
 The most disturbing thing is the treatment with the story
 kahani vartmaan se shuru hoti he or pathakon ko flashbek main le jaati he, phir bade hi atapate dhang se katha kaa ant ho jaataa he
 The story does not return again in the present
 pathakon ke saamne yah sawaal rah jaataa he ki dipankar or shalmali lambey samay baad milte hai to prem ke ve rang unke bheetar kis tarah se ghulte hai jise peeche chhodkar jivan kii dagar par donon aage nikal gaye the
 Perhaps it is to this end that a Tishnagi is realized by reading this novel
 barason baad shalmali or dipankar jis tarah milte hai or unke andar jo bhav panpate hai, use bas chhukar hi guzar gaye hai dinesh pathak
 From that meeting, the episodes of the narrative are connected, it is correct, but where the episodes of the narrative end, it cannot be the end of the story
 naav na bandho aisi thor prem kaa vah shaashvat ehsaas he jo har aadmi ke bheetar kisi na kisi rup main maujuud rahata he
 Shalmali and Dipankar are professors by profession and there is a similarity between the two
 donon kaa sarokaar sahitya se he
 Dipankar is associated with Hindi literature and Shalmali with English literature
 donon main ek athmiya rishta panapata he
 The initiative comes from Shalmali
 isaki vajah he
 Shalmali, a lover of literature, has a feeling of incompleteness somewhere in her life and this incompleteness brings her to Dipankar
 pati ke paas shalmali kii bhaawanaaon ko samajhne-jaanane kaa samay nahin he
 He is so entangled in his business that Shalmali does not live with him
 dipankar bhi shaadishuda hai or bharaapura parivaar he
 Wife is a partner in every happiness and sorrow
 un donon ke bich kisi 'tisare' k pravesh puri tarah varjit he
 But Shalmali breaks it and manages to break into Dipankar's life
 uskaa yah prem deh kii bhukh mitaane ke liye nahin he
 Having attained Dipankar's proximity, she wants to feel a deep sense of happiness, which she has not been able to meet with her husband or family
 vah nahin jaanati ki is prem kaa anjaam kya hoga, phir bhi dipankar ko chaahati he
 After walking some distance together, Dipankar realizes that he is not doing well with the family
 khud ko sanyamit kar vah parivaar ke paas laut jaataa he
 In Hindi literature, many female characters like Shalmali will be found
 so, bahuton ko upanyaas padhate hue kai chehre isamen dikhaai de sakate hai
 The story has also started with mention of the politics of literature and the rise of literature
 pathak ise bahut vistaar nahin dete
 Between the chaos in the education world, the rot of power and system, they curtail pen but love is at the core of the story
 kuch bhavuk kshanon main bhi unhone apane paatro ko bhatakaaya nahin he
 In the era of globalization, when words like love have been reduced to 'valentine's Day', then this novel also soaks and immerses us in the color of love

 He sparked controversy by saying that the five star hotels where beef is served should be brushed with brick like Babri Masjid

 Lalu can eat anything

 If Hindus go out, don't they eat? All eat meat and beef

 However, he later clarified that the devil had entered his mouth and that is what he said
 sangeet som bhi koode vivaad membijapi vidhayak sangeet som bhi is vivaad main kud gaye
 He said that Azam Khan's mental balance is not right
 unhen apana ilaaj karana chahie

 haridwar ke paas hi bilva parvat par wo sthaan he jahaan mata parvati ne kathor tap kar pati rup main kailash vaasi aughaddani shiv ko paaya tha
 In Haridwar, Shiva got his ardhangini not once or twice
 pehle shiv ne daksheshwar ke raja daksh kii putree sati ko patni rup main paaya or phir unheen mata sati ne yajna kunda main bhasma hokar himalay raaj ke ghar parvati ke rup main janm liya
 Parvati, on the advice of Lord Rishi Narada, came to the picturesque Bilva mountain surrounded by Belpatras and performed harsh penance of Shiva and pleased Bholenath and became her ardhagini again
 haridwar se pashchim main har kii paudi se thodi hi duuri par ye paavan sthaan he, jahaan pratishthit bilvakeshwar mahadev kaa pracheen mandir he
 Below Sheshnag, Bilvakeshwar Mahadev is in the form of a penis
 kehete hai mata parvati yahaan belptr khaakar apni bhukh shant kiya karti thi, lekin jab pine ke liye pani kii samasya aayi tab devataaon ke aagrah par swayan parampita brahma ne apane kamandal se ganga kii jaldhara prakat kii
 It is famous today as Gauri Kund, just 50 steps from Bilvakeshwar Temple
 manyata he ki tapasya ke dauraan mata parvati isi gauri kunda main snaan kiya karti thi or isi kunda kaa pani piya karti thi
 Bilvakeshwar Mahadev Temple, Bholebhandari, is the abode of Jatadhari Lord Shiva Shankar
 yah mata parvati kii wo taposthali he jahaan kii gai aradhana or tapasya se shiv shankar jald prasann hokar bhakton par apni krupa barasaate hai
 It is said that by coming here to remember Bholenath with reverence, he gets delighted and gives a boon to his devotees
 jin kunvaari kanyaon kaa vivaah na ho rahaa ho yaa phir unke vivaah main kisi bhi prakaar kii aadchan aa rahi ho, bilvakeshwar mahadev mandir main aakar bhole bhandari kaa abhishek kar belptr chadhaane bhar se vivaah main aa rahi pareshaaniyaan dur ho jaati he, saath hi kanyaon ko uttam var kii prapti hoti he
 Mokshadayini leads to life with the mere touch of the holy waves of the Ganges, liberation from all sinful deeds
 shiv kii jataaon se nikali ganga ke is pavitra jal main snaan kar bhakt bhole ke darbar main pahunchate hai
 Where Goddess Parvati's divine penance rain on the earth's blessings and gets the blessings of Bholebhandari and all blessings to be fulfilled
 belvrikshon ke is manoram van main bilvakeshwar mahadev virajte hai
 In this temple of Bilvakeshwar Mahadev there is a law of worship twice daily
 jisaki shuruyaat subah 5 baje ho jaati he
 In the morning, first of all, there is Jalabhishek of Shivling with the holy water of Gauri Kund, then Shiva is revered and adorned with Shiva
 shiv ke is durlabh ling par darshan-pujan karne dur-dur se log yahaan aate hai
 Because it is believed that by offering Panchamrit anointing of Bilvakeshwar Mahadev and offering them cannabis, dhatura, belpatra and flowers, Bholenath fulfills his wish soon
 kehete hai bilvakeshwar mahadev par maatr belptr chadhaane bhar se 1 karod saal tak swarg main nivas kaa mauka miltaa he
 It is believed that Shiva resides in Haridwar in Sawan
 tabhi to bhole ke asakhya bhakton kaa yahaan puure maheene tantaa laga rahata he or jo sawan maheene main yahaan nahin aa pate wo shiv ke priy somvaar ko yahaan aakar puja abhishek karte hai
 The importance of bathing in this miraculous Gauri Kund reputed near Bilvakeshwar Mahadev is nothing less than worship in the Bilvakeshwar Mahadev Temple and this importance is further enhanced on Makar Sankranti
 jis tarah bhakt or bhagwaan kaa rishta janm-janmaantar kaa he usee tarah janm-janmaantar se bholenath se bandhe hai nandi maharaj
 Every wish to reach Bholenath has to be said in his ear here too
 mahadev ke is dham main din kii antim aarti kaa vishesh mahatv hota he, jo yahaan 6 baje sampann hoti he
 The priests adorn Bilvakeshwar Mahadev with sandalwood, flowers and ballads, and then the worship of Bilvakeshwar Mahadev begins with incense, which makes the whole atmosphere of the Bilva mountain shiva

 From Twitter to Facebook, the voice of protest was equally intense, hardly a young icon tried to connect with the youth on his branded laptop
 ek tarah se yah upeksha kii had thi
 Let's admit that his safety could have been threatened by getting out on the road, but what was the hurdle in online communication? India Today tried to know from the next generation of mps why they ignored the protesters
 Some of them answered our curiosity

 Nationalist Congress's Agatha Sangma and Supriya Sule also spoke
 kuch netaaon ne apni gaiyr-maujuudagi kaa bachaav kiya lekin apane naam ko chhupaae rakhane kaa aagrah bhi kiya
 The skin of some leaders turned out to be very thick, for example Deepender Hooda, Dushyant Singh, Jitin Prasad, Ajay Maken and Ashok Tanwar did not feel the need to turn back and call despite repeated messages
 congressi saansad naveen jindal ne hamase baat to kii, lekin unhen jaise hi pataa chalaa ki ham kya poochne ja rahe hai, unhone maafee maangate hue baad main hamen kol karne ko kaha
 But they did not fulfill the promise to call us
 maakan ne twit kiya, ''ham ek samaaj ke taur par naakaam sabit hue,” haalanki ve khud kyon nahin sadak par aae, iskaa jawaab unhone nahin diya
 This is even more important because most of the demonstrations were held in his constituency New Delhi
 congress ke netaaon kii hi tarah bijepi ke yuva netaa bhi pradarshnon se aankh munde rahe
 38-year-old Anurag Thakur, head of bjp's youth wing, found it appropriate to stay in his home state of Himachal Pradesh during this period
 haa, unke pita ke netritv vaali bijepi sarkaar ko haal ke chunaav main haar kaa munh dekhnaa padaa he
 "I have been in Himachal since the election results (on 20 December) but the party's youth wing workers were present at India Gate," he said

 Another glimpse of 32-year-old Varun Gandhi of BJP, another young MP from BJP, was seen at Anna Hazare's rally in Delhi in August 2011, but this time he remained completely missing

 He said, "I am going to be a father, but he is facing some problems

 "some other young Congress leaders claim that they wanted to meet the protesters but there were no positive signs from senior party leaders

 Surprisingly, women mps also did not appear anywhere during this period
 congress kii 40 varshiya saansad jyoti mirdha ko is dauraan kisi maamle ko sulajhane ke liye apane kshetra nagaur janaa pad gaya
 By the way, he has sent some concrete suggestions to the Justice Verma Committee
 ve khud doctor hai, lihaaja unka ek suzav yah he ki balaatkaar ke aaropee kaa badhiyaakaran yaa rasinic badhiyaakaran thik nahin hoga kyonki yah prabhavi nahin hota
 He has also sent suggestions that the legal definition of a minor should be reconsidered
 philhal 18 saal se kam umr ke vyakti ko naaballig mana jaataa he
 This time, one of the accused in the gang rape is a minor and on the pretext, he can escape harsh punishment, although he is said to be the most barbaric
 sirf itnaa hi nahin, mirdha ne apane sujhaavon ke samarthan main kuch antarrashtriya adhyayan kii reportein bhi sanlagn kii hai jinamein bataaya gaya he ki ladke 10 saal kii umr main or ladkiyaan 6 saal kii umr main hi vayask ho jaati hai

 baatcheet main unhone sweekaar kiya ki netaaon ne yuvaaon kii aawaaj ko dabaaya he, lekin unhone iskaa doshi samooche rajnatik tabake ko tehraaya
 He said, "I don't believe that only some leaders should have been active on the basis of their age and sexuality
" sach to yah he ki samoochaa rajnatik tabaka hi shuruyaat se yuvaaon ke saath samvaad kaayam nahin kar sakaa
 Hopefully, at least from now on, we will be able to work together and turn their resentment into concrete measures that will make women feel safe and challenge the traditional mindset

 He admitted that leaders need to learn a lesson from this extreme ruthless incident
 unhone saaf-saaf kaha, ''yuvaaon ko thos karrwai chahie, unhen aisi raahat or santosh chahie jo saaf-saaf dikhaai de, or ve chaahate hai ki yah jald-se-jald ho

 This conversation served to alleviate the tension prevailing in the protests

 They have the ability to create a government in the state, from spoiling it

 BJP, on the other hand, has been sitting on the throne of power, winning five consecutive assembly elections in the state with the help of them
 gujarat mencongress se satta chhinakar use bijepi kii jholii main daal dene kaa shrey keshubhai patel ko jaataa he
 However, when Keshubhai Patel rebelled against the BJP in 2012 and came to a different fate, the Patidar society did not give him a quote
 ab ek baar phir patel samudaay se 24 saal ke hardik patel ne bijepi ke khilaaf jhanda buland kiya he
 Questions are arising that will Hardik Patel prove to be a bigger challenge for BJP than Keshubhai Patel of 2012? Will Patidar, seen with Hardik, vote against BJP? Will Hardik Patel be able to stop Narendra Modi's chariot in Gujarat? Gujarat's King Maker Gujarat's Patidar community is around 16%
 rajya kii 182 siton main se 60-65 siten aisi hai, jahaan patidaar samudaay jeet-haar tay karata he
 In the last election, around 50 mlas won from the Patel community

 There are 10 ministers in the cabinet including the Deputy Chief Minister

 Keshubhai made the Patidar society a traditional voter of the BJP
 haalanki siyasat ne aisi karavat lee ki keshubhai patel ko saat maheene ke baad hi mukhyamantri pad se hatana padaa
 After this, Keshubhai became Chief Minister again in 1998 and remained Chief Minister for almost four years
 baad main unhen hataakar narendra modi ko bijepi ne mukhyamantri banaaya
 Patidar did not even belong to Keshubhai Patel, Keshubhai Patel made a separate Gujarat Parivartan Party by asking BJP

 The ground was packed and was echoed with the slogan 'bapa tum kalon karo, hum se aapke hain'
 keshubhai ne apane siyaasi daur main yah naaraa kai baar suna rahaa hoga lekin is baar baat kuch alag thi
 In 2012, Keshubhai Patel was seeking votes, not for the BJP
 keshubhai ne mike pakadaa or kaha ki yah aap logon ko sunishchit karnaa he ki is ilaake se bijepi ek bhi seat na jeetne paae
 He was repeating this in every rally
 lekin jab chunavi nattejey aae to keshubhai patel ke saare armaan dhare rah gaye
 Keshubhai's party got just 2 seats and got about 4 percent of the vote
 narendra modi parinaam saaf hote hi sabase pehle keshubhai patel ke paas gaye or unhen mithai khilaai
 The results made it clear that Keshubhai would have been the leader of the Patidar community at some point, but today is Modi's time and Keshubhai has no importance in the politics of Gujarat
 keshubhai patel ke vidroh se bijepi ko bahut bada nuksaan nahin hua
 They were able to influence only a few seats
 gujarat kendriya vishvavidhyalay ke professor jai prakaash pradhan kehete hai ki purv mukhyamantri keshubhai patel ne 2012 main logon ko teesraa vikalp dekar galati kar di
 He got angry Patel votes, but neither BJP nor Congress benefited from it
 is baar patelon ke paas bijepi se naaraazgi kaa congress hi vikalp he
 Hardik's challenge to BJP: Narendra Modi's arrival from Gujarat to Delhi has weakened bjp's grip in the state

 This movement of Patidars gradually merged the youth of entire Gujarat with them

 As a result, in the 2015 district panchayat elections, the Congress won 8 out of 11 seats in Saurashtra

 The BJP is trying its best to cut Hardik, but is not yet taking the name of the fever that has descended on the Patidars

 chini akhbaar global times ne shuukravaar ko prakashit apane sampadakeey main sena pramukh general bipin ravat par is hafte die gaye unke yuddh sambandhi bayaan ko lekar jamkar nishaanaa saadhaa he
 The editorial said that it should be accepted that Bipin Rawat has a very big mouth and can ignite a fire between Beijing and New Delhi
 antarrashtriya niyamon ke prati ravat ne aankh moond rakhi he or yah bhi dikhaata he ki bhartiya sena main kitna ahankaar bharaa he
 Rawat has advocated a state of war on two fronts in a very high profile manner, but where did the Indian Army have so much confidence? seemaa par takat dikhaane kaa daur shurubata den ki ek seminar main bolte hue ravat ne nai dilli main china se sambandhit bayaan diya tha, "jahaan tak hamaare uttari virdohi kaa sawaal he to takat dikhaane kaa daur shuru ho chukaa he
 It is a matter of concern for us to gradually occupy the terrain and test our tolerance
 is prakaar kii paristhiti ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie jo dhire-dhire sangharsh ke rup main badal sakati he
 "china expressed concern over Rawat's statement on Thursday, expressing surprise over the war-related statement of Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat, asking whether this was also the opinion of the Indian government and whether he was 'authorized' to make such a statement
" , At a time when the leaders of the two countries have met on positive issues after the two-month-long Doklam dispute
 general ravat ke bayaan ki 'bharat ko donon morche (china va pakistan) par yuddh ke liye tainaat rahanaa chahie' par tippanee karte hue china ke videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa geng shuang ne kaha, "hamen yah nahin pataa ki kya vah in baton ko kehane ke liye adhikrut hai yaa phir swat: sfoort achaanak kahe gaye shabd hai yaa phir yah tippanee bharat sarkaar ke rukh kaa pratinidhitiv karti he?"ravat kaa bayaan buudhvaar ko aise samay aayaa he jab ek din pehle hi bricks sammelan se itar bharat ke pradhanmantri narendra modi or china ke raashtrapati shi jinping ne mulaakaat kii thi or seemaa par shanti banaae rakhane par sahmati jataai thi
 Rawat's statement has irritated Beijing: Global Times has given a very sharp reaction among all of them, which shows how irritated Beijing is by the Army Chief's statement
 bricks summit main modi or shi kii mulaakaat ke turant baad hi ravat ne seemaa par china kii siinaajori kii ore dhyaan dilaayaa he
 The Chinese media presented the agreement on the Doklam dispute as Xi Jinping's success
 sampadakeey main kaha gaya he ki ravat kaa bayaan doklam vivaad samaapt hone ke hafte bhar ke bheetar hi aayaa he, jab china or bharat ke netaaon ne bricks summit ke dauraan mulaakaat kii or donon deshon ke bich sambandhon ko lekar sakaaratmak sanket die
 The newspaper says that when many people believe that the two countries should leave the Doklam dispute and move forward, Bipin Rawat has given a completely opposite statement
 chini akhbaar ne talkh tippanee karte hue kaha he ki bhartiya generalon ko taaja sthiti ke bare main kuch basic jaankaree rakhni chahie
 Can India withstand the fight on two fronts if china-pakistan open the front simultaneously? Take care of people like Bipin Rawat

 And another continues to make inflammatory statements against China

 ’ raav ne kaha, ‘hamaara nivesh bahut kam he, der se miltaa he
 We worked for the money we got
 hamen jitne paise mil rahe hai wo kuch bhi nahin hai
 Sanjay Raut said, why not Vajpayee, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on the demand of Atal Bihari Vajpayee being given Bharat Ratna, if Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru can get this award, then why not Vajpayee? Farooq Abdullah also said - Vajpayee was honored by the President of Bharat Ratna International Conference and Union Minister Farooq Abdullah for the former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee

 Due to this, i cannot tell the names of two government employees sitting in this kiosk
 lekin mere man main in do bujurgon ke prati behad sammaan aayaa, jo badboo ke is 'aatankwaad' ke bich nidarta se sarkari kaam ko anjaam de rahe hai
 a mental patient was sitting next to this kiosk, who was lightening the weight of the stomach, not urine
 mere haath main mike or camera dekhakar us sarkari karmchaaree ke sabar kaa baandh tut gaya
 See this situation of DTC, which delivers 10 lakh people home every day, showing khokas, there is no water, no electricity, from above (showing that mental patient and two people urinating), these shameless people are not ashamed
 
 aap yahaan paanch minute bhi rukkar dikhaa den betaa
 
 
 What should we do, either work in the midst of this urine or quit the job
 
 
 main baglein jhaankne laga
 The smell of urine felt sharp attacking the brain
 main vahaan se bhaag janaa chahta tha
 Then that elder said leave, what news will you make
 
 
 usne sir jhatka or us khokhe main jaakar baith gaya
 Where the cocktail smell of urine and defecation was like a hawk, the KTC of that DTC was nabbed, the voice of the conductor standing outside the kiosk was heard, hurry why Tau is smelling bad smell
 main bhi jaldi se car main baitha or teji se darwaja band kar ek lambii saans lee or aage bad gaya

 aapako bataa den ki pashchimi uttar pradesh main pichley vidhansabha chunaav main akhilesh lahar ko bispi kii ore se kadi takkar mili thi
 SP-BSP had a tough competition, looking at the data of the 2012 assembly elections, in western Uttar Pradesh, SP got 24 seats, BSP got 23 seats, BJP got 13 seats, RLD got 9 seats and Congress got 5 seats
 mathura kii maant seat upachunaav ke dauraan bijepi ke khate main aa gai thi
 At the same time, RLD mlas from Govardhan seat of Mathura have now joined BJP
 isi tarah se aligarh kii barauli vidhansabha se areldi vidhayak bhi ab bijepi main shaamil ho chuke hai
 The benefit of polarization appears to be in favor of the BJP after the Muzaffarnagar riots of August 2013 in western Uttar Pradesh divided into two classes
 rajya ke is hisse main loksabhaa chunaavon ke dauraan dhruvikaran kaa prabhaav saaf najar aayaa tha
 Being a Hindu dominated area, BJP is hoping for some relief
 vahiin mayawati dalit-muslim gathjod saadhane main lagi hui hai
 The Jat fraternity has changed its mind to move away from BJP to RLD this time
 ajit singh pichhali reliyon main saaf kehete aa rahe hai ki chaahe kuch bhi ho jaae ve bijepi ke saath gathbandhan nahin karenge
 It is clear that Chaudhary does not want to leave any stone unturned to anger the Jats
 to kya is vajah se akhilesh ne kiya tha kinaaraaraajanneetik jaankaron ke mutabik akhilesh ko jaaton kii bijepi se naaraazgi kaa bhaan tha
 They knew that if aligned with the RLD, the Jat vote would not come with the alliance
 vajah saaf he, pashchimi upi main badhati communal tension
 The current situation clearly denies that Muslims and Jats should vote for the same party
 isi vajah se areldi kaa alag chunaav ladanaa kahin na kahin akhilesh ke liye hi phydemand hoga
 Maya also did the best in the election
 Election results are more issue based and less caste based

 Since the riots in Muzaffarnagar in August 2013, the Jats and Muslims had been divided, the RLD has been trying to reunite them for quite some time

 This support to the BJP in the general elections may dominate the social issues in the assembly elections
 pashchimi upi jat or muslim bahulya he to mudde bhi inhen virgon se jude hue honge
 The Muslim class has been the traditional vote bank of the SP, so the issues related to the Jat community may be overshadowed by the BJP in the elections

 How will the child rape stop when the accused are not put in jail? Based on the total number of cases of Bachpan Bachao Andolan 2014, 2015, 2016, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) said that the conviction in the case of rape related to children The rate is only 9 percent, which is very less than the average of the rest of the national crime
 bachapan bachaao andolnaki legal head prabhsahay cor ne bataaya ki lau kanvikshan rate kam hona bacchon ke khilaaf cases ke badhane kaa bada kaaran he
 This is terrible, it is even more dangerous in poxo cases

 report ye kahati he ki 99 pratishat bacchon ko companseshan nahin mila he
 Even if a victim has received compensation, it is less than Rs 50,000
 agar kisi bachche kaa rape ho jaataa he to to wo ajukeshan system se bhi nikal jaataa he
 In many cases the victim has not received free legal help
 yahaan tak ki health assistance bhi nahin mil rahi he
 His future family comes to an end

 In 2012 when the Poxo Act came out
 tab special court bhi banaae gaye the

 The Supreme Court had given a guideline that in each High Court a committee of three judges will be made to watch every Poxo case
