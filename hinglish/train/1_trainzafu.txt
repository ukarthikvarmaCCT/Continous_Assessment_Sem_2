 After boycotting on behalf of the villagers, the government reached Swarupnagar police station on January 8 and lodged a complaint

 This article is called Friday Flashback
 flashbek filmon main us sichuation kaa naam he jab hero vartmaan main khadaa rahata he lekin uski ankhon par aisi dhundh jamane lagati he ki vah dhire-dhire ateet main chalaa jaataa he
 How good he is when he is a child, or a teenager, or before going to jail
 ateet ke aise kai seen hindi filmon main flashbek ke rup main dikhaae jate hai
 Many times were so long that the first half was removed in a flashback
 jaise hi hero yaa heroin flashbek se laut kar aate hai to donon main se koi ek sakapakaaya hua idhar udhar dekhtaa he or unamem se koi ek tezi se mudata hua duusari disha main chalane lagata he
 The story then moves on from there, but only then it becomes interval
 ram naam satya he
 
 
 Ram's name was still true, but it is still true, but the year it was still a lie is still a lie
 wo 2013 kaa saal tha
 It was a strange year
 kisi bhoot kii tarah shmashaan se nikal aata he
 The cylinder was cast
 daam 600 ke aas paas tha
 Now the cost of the same cylinder has been Rs 833, but the funeral processors are missing
 darasal wo arathi kaa arth samaj chuke hai
 They know that politics is false, Ram's name is true
 sochie 600 daam hua tha tab in logon ne kameez utaar di thi, manmohan singh hai hai kar rahe the
 Now that the cylinder is more than 800, where is his shirt, where is the trouser, we do not know
 agar ye aapako dikhen to mujhe bataaiyegaa
 In the Friday flashback, we will take you to the days when petrol used to increase diesel prices and then there was a strong performance
 aaj bahut se log us vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai jo tel ke daam badhane par pradarshnon kii sankhya badha detaa tha
 This is what many people are looking for in today's opposition that performed before 2014
 puch rahe ki he aaj ke vipaksh tum kal ke vipaksh kii tarah kyon nahin ho
 What has happened to you vahi globe, vahi globalizeshan magar tel ke daam ko lekar itnaa alag-alag pikcharizeshan
 Why is it so brother
 aag kii lapaton ke hawaale kar diya gaya yah moped
 He is the unsung hero of the history of protest against inflation, who could not even tell the agony of having or not having his insurance
 jala di gai bas ko yah bharosa rahaa hoga ki jal jane do sakhi, gar mere jalane se deazal phir kabhi mahangaa na hoga
 These people are so self-righteous
 khudargaz nahin hai inkaa gol clear he
 Moved from the heat of smoke because they know that we have come to burn tires, not to burn
 pleez aap log moped, bas or tair kii qurbaani yaad rakhie
 Never Forget
 hui peeche hat gaye
 They came to burn, not to burn
 mahangaai ke ye raajnneetik virdohi rajdhani express ke saamne hi chale ja rahe the
 The train knew that these people are the expresses at this time, they are not
 flashbek friday main ham yaad kar rahe hai 2010, 12 or 13 ke saal ko jab petrol or deazal ke daam badhate hi vipaksh bardaasht nahin karata tha
 Then when the price was 74 rupees a liter, Ravi Shankar Prasad used to go by bicycle, now when he is 80 rupees he is not cycling
 bijepi ke hi rameshwar chaurasia ne cycle kii sadhana kar lee thi, camere ke liye handle sambhaal liya magar ab inhen 80 yaa 89 rupee prati litre petrol se koi fark nahin padataa hoga
 He is the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Sadanand Gowda, when he is no longer, is cycling
 aaj jab petrol aitihaasik rup se mahangaa he ummid he unki wo vaali cycle abhi kaam main aati hogi
 We asked some people whether you are missing the 2012-13 protests against petrol prices
 agar aap miss kar rahe hai to flashbek friday zarur dekhie
 There are some basic duties of India's politics
 mahangaai ko bardaasht nahin karnaa he, bhale daam kam na ho lekin virodh karte rahanaa he
 There are many videos of BJP leaders protesting inflation in the library
 us samay jab petrol ke daam 74 rupee hote the to itihaas gavaah he ki bijepi ke netaaon ne pradarshan karne main koi aalasy nahin kiya he
 Many of the leaders involved in those demonstrations became ministers
 puraane pradarshan ke vijual main koi nahin kah saktaa ki sushamaa swaraj sirius nahin hai
 The old anger of the foreign minister's face is telling how much Sirius will be living on inflation
 ummid kerani chahie wo aaj bhi sirius hongi
 In their performance, these women are carrying the cylinder on the head
 media ke camaron ko thik se dikhe ki silendar kaa hi daam badha he isliye sar par silendar laade ye log sushamaa ji kii sabha main baithi hai
 Today, the subsidized cylinder is 833 rupees
 sitambar 2012 main bina sabsidi vaala silendar 750 rupaya kaa ho gaya tha
 The cylinders placed sideways in the kitchen were pulled from house to house on the streets
 jab bhi pradarshan hota tha koi na koi silendar liye chalaa aata tha
 Petrol and diesel have been run out
 nai sarkaar ai to antarashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat 115 dollar prati bairal se ghat kar 45-50 dollar prati bairal par aa gai
 Still there was no reduction in prices
 logon ne samajhnaa band kar diya ki 115 dollar prati bairal par petrol 74 rupee he to 46 dollars prati bairal par tel 70 rupee prati litre kyon he
 Now they do not understand that the price of crude oil is only 75 to 80 dollars per barrel, then how did petrol become 89 rupees per liter
 jabaki prati bairal kachche tel kii keemat 115 dollar bhi nahin hui he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had told the economics formula in a demonstration at that time
 ab vahi jetali vitt mantri hai
 It is said that this has happened due to international circumstances
 kehete nahin balki blog likhte hai
 The international situation was also during the time of Manmohan Singh
 par ek baat kii daad deni hogi
 Although petrol prices have historically been the highest, but the government has not moved away from petrol pumps
 aap kisi bhi petrol pump par jaaiye, jaise hi tel bharaa kar niklenge, saamne pradhanmantri mil jaaenge
 There is no pump where the Prime Minister's poster is not present
 kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri ji sab dekh hi rahe hai to tel ke daam kaa kya virodh karnaa
 Let's fill it and leave quietly
 daam badhane se gas kaa phayda kam nahin ho jaataa
 If you watch this Prime Minister's poster carefully, you will understand
 gas kaa kharchaa roj kaa 10-15 rupaya kaa he
 450 of the month
 ye zaruri he ki 833 rupee waalon kaa hisaab is poster par nahin he
 It was decided in June last year that petrol diesel and gas prices would be fixed every day
 ek din main kabhi itani vruddhi nahin hui jitani 7 sitambar ko hui he
 The price of petrol has increased by more than 50 paise
 dilli main hi petrol kareeb 80 rupee kaa ho gaya he
 Many small cities are getting between 87 and 89 rupees
 vahaan par koi bhi cycle chalaakar pradarshan nahin kar rahaa he
 In 2010, Mahatma also came against inflation
 mahatma kya vaaki mahangaai kaa virodh karne aae the
 Now that inflation has increased a lot, what would these divine souls be doing these days who came here as Mahatmas
 usee saal july main bharat band hua tha
 What was left and right were all involved in it
 ek hi manch par bijepi ek hi manch par sipiem
 UPA ally Mamta Banerjee also took to the streets
 rose unka bayaan aata tha ki daam kam karo, janata mari ja rahi he
 Inflation united the BJP and the Left
 flashbek friday main saal 2010 bhi he jab july main bharat band hua tha
 The same year a film came in Peepli Live
 vidwaanon main aaj tak yah matbhed he ki vah film bharat kii raajnneeti or media kii god se nikali thi yaa us film se aaj kii raajnneeti or media kaa satya niklaa tha
 Inflation became witchy with a song from the same film and inflation witch was happening in every performance
 in dinon mahangaai usase zyada he magar ab vah dian nahin, jaanam he
 Vijay Goel
 khud ko bike par set karte hue
 Once the position is set and Goyal's bike convoy moves
 bike par baithe vijay kii raily thik se cover ho, iske liye camere vaale car kii chat par savaar hai
 Anything can happen in the rally, so have brought old cars
 koi apni nai car lekar nahin aata he
 There is an atmosphere of rar, iqarar and wrangling
 goyal bike par chadhakar shila dikshit se istipha maangane gaye hai
 Petrol in Delhi was Rs 74 per liter on 1 September 2013
 1 sitambar 2018 ko 78 rupee 68 paise ho gaya
 That's why people are looking for these performing bikers
 vijay goyal to mantri ho gaye lekin kya in kaaryakartaaon kii bhi tarakkee ho gai he, kya unhen 79 rupee petrol bharaane main zaraa bhi takalif nahin ho rahi he
 There used to be a daily press conference at that time
 bijepi kii taraf se rose hamale hote the
 There was daily rescue from the government
 janata tab bhi vahi thi janata ab bhi vahi he
 Just those who were in the government are in the opposition and those who were in the opposition are in the government
 2014 se pehle tak bijepi main rahe yashavanth sinha ne bijepi chhod di he
 He tweeted that the prices of petrol diesel are going up, what is the opposition doing
 aisa laga ki ve bhi vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai
 The Congress has declared a Bharat Bandh on 10 September
 kya wo kuch nayaa kahegi yaa phir vahi kahegi jo bijepi 2013 ke saal main kaha karti thi
 Petrol prices are increasing
 log sehate ja rahe hai
 Rather, people are becoming comfortable
 poochne par koi kah rahaa he ki takalif he
 The media has left this topic
 ab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami nahin hoti he
 Then the government used to fail due to increase in prices
 kya din kya raat pradarshan hi pradarshan hua karte the
 We are showing all this so that whenever there is a demonstration regarding the price of petrol diesel, you will feel that you have seen something like this, you have heard something similar but where have you seen, where have you heard, whom have you heard and that Where are you now hamaara rupaya
 a dollar 68 was raised in August 2013, becoming the issue
 samajhnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki ab jab ek dollar 72 rupye kaa ho gaya to kya sarkaar kii garima gir gai, pradhanmantri kii garima gir gai
 What happened
 kya raajnneeti main 2013 kaa saal tarkon ke khatm hone kaa saal tha
 Or that year did a lot of trickery
 sabakuch record kar liya taaki baad main bataa sake ki raajnneeti main hameshaa taarkik baat nahin kahi jaati he
 Leaders do not speak right in opposition or go right in government
 sarkaar main hone se sab sarkaar nahin ho jate hai
 What does not have to happen does not happen by being in the government and it does not happen either
 baaki aap vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai to pehle khud ko bhi khojie
 Yes the media has changed
 media ab vipaksh ko gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 Then he gave more importance to the opposition than the government
 uske paas jaataa tha
 Then he used to go to people's kitchen
 kheton main jaataa tha poochne ke liye ki mahangaai badi he to kya takalif he
 Some one must still go, our reporters still go and may have gone to others
 tippaniyan Petrol started getting 80 rupees a liter
 deazal petrol kii tarah mahangaa ho gaya
 Don't know when it will be 80 rupees
 rupee kii haalat bhi kamazor he
 But that is not what used to happen then
 log badal gaye yaa phir tivi kaa screen badal gaya
 This program has been made in the memory of those who were not leaders and are not even today but went to those rallies after the leaders were called
 petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh kar rahe the
 They will be so restless today
 kitna man karata hoga ki chalo pradarshan karte hai magar ja nahin pate honge
 Among them, Navjot Sidhu is in the best situation
 bijepi main the to hathi par chadhakar mahangaai kaa virodh karne gaye the, ab congress main hai to kar hi sakate hai lekin congress ke netaa kapil sibabl to kitaab likh rahe hai, sadak par kab utrenge
 the name of Ram is the truth
 
 
 ram kaa naam tab bhi satya tha ab bhi satya he magar jo saal tha tab bhi jhooth tha ab bhi jhooth he
 It was the year of 2013
 ajeeb saal tha vah
 Like a ghost comes out of the crematorium
 silendar kii arathi nikali thi
 The price was around 600
 ab usee silendar kaa daam 833 rupaya ho chukaa he, magar shavyatra nikaalane vaale gaayab hai
 Actually, they have understood the meaning of Arathi
 wo jaanate hai ki raajnneeti juthi he, ram kaa naam satya he
 Think 600 was the price when these people took off the shirt, Manmohan Singh was doing hi
 ab jab silendar 800 se adhik kaa he, inaki kameez kahaan par he, patalun kahaan par he, ham nahin jaanate hai
 If you see them, let me know
 friday flash back main ham un dinon kii taraf aapako le chalenge jab petrol deazal ke daam badha karte the or tab kya zordaar pradarshan hua karata tha
 Today many people are searching for the opposition which used to increase the number of demonstrations when the oil price went up
 yahi bahut se log aaj ke vipaksh main us vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai jo 2014 ke pehle pradarshan karata tha
 Asking, "O today's opposition, why are you not like yesterday's opposition?" tumhen kya ho gaya he
 The same globe, the same globalization, but such a different picture of the price of oil
 aisa kyon he bhai
 This moped was handed over to the flames
 mahangaai ke virodh ke itihaas kaa vah gumnaam nayak he jo apane isurance hone yaa na hone kii vyathaa bhi na kah sakaa
 The bus that was burnt must have been confident that let it go burning, diesel would never be expensive again due to my burning
 ye insaan kitne kudagarz hai
 They are not self-centered, their goal is clear
 dhuen kii taap se isliye peeche hat gaye kyonki inhen pataa he ki ham tair jalaane aae hai, jalane nahin
 Please remember the sacrifice of mopeds, buses and tires
 kabhi forget mat kariye
 Hui backed away
 ye jalaane aae the, jalane nahin
 These political opponents of inflation were going in front of Rajdhani Express
 train ko pataa tha ki is vakt express ye log hai, wo nahin
 In Flashback Friday, we remember the years of 2010, 12 and 13, when the opposition did not tolerate the rise in prices of petrol and diesel
 tab jab daam 74 rupee litre tha ravishankar prasad cycle se chale the, ab jab 80 rupee he ve cycle se nahin chal rahe hai
 Rameshwar Chaurasia of BJP had done the cycle work, took the handle for the camera, but now he will not make any difference from Rs 80 or 89 per liter of petrol
 ye karnataka ke mukhyamantri hai sadanand gauda, tab the ab nahin hai, cycle chalaa rahe hai
 Today, when petrol is historically expensive, it is expected that their bicycle will still be useful
 hamane kuch logon se poocha ki kya aap petrol ke daam ke khilaaf 2012-13 ke pradarshnon ko miss kar rahe hai
 If you're missing out, check out Flashback Friday
 bharat kii raajnneeti ke kuch mul katarvy hai
 Do not tolerate inflation, even if the price is not low, but keep opposing
 librari main mahangaai kaa virodh karte hue bijepi netaaon ke khub video hai
 At that time when petrol price was 74 rupees then history is witness that BJP leaders have not done any laziness in demonstrating
 un pradarshnon main jitne netaa shaamil the, unamem se kai mantri ban gaye
 In the visual of the old performance, no one can say that Sushma Swaraj is not a Sirius
 videsh mantri ke chehre kaa purana gussa bataa rahaa he ki wo mahangaai ko lekar kitni sirius rahati hongi
 Hopefully she will still be Sirius today
 unke pradarshan main sar par silendar laade ye mahilaayein chali aa rahi hai
 The media cameras should see that the price of the cylinder has increased so these people are sitting in Sushma ji's meeting
 aaj bina sabsidi vaala silendar 833 rupee kaa he
 In September 2012, the non-subsidized cylinder became Rs 750
 rasoi main kinare rakhe silendar ko ghar ghar se khinch kar sadakon par laayaa gaya tha
 Whenever there was a demonstration, there was a cylinder
 petrol or deazal belgaum ho chukaa he
 When the new government came, the price of crude oil in the international market fell from $ 115 per barrel to $ 45-50 per barrel
 phir bhi keemton main koi kami nahin hui
 People stopped understanding that petrol is Rs 74 at $ 115 per barrel, so why is oil at Rs 70 per liter at $ 46 per barrel
 ab unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki kachche tel kii keemat to sirf 75 se 80 dollar prati bairal he phir petrol 89 rupee prati litre kaise ho gaya
 While the price of crude oil per barrel is not even $ 115
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne us vakt ek pradarshan main arthshaastra kaa formula bataaya tha
 Now Jaitley is the Finance Minister
 kehete hai ki antarrashtriya paristhitiyon ke kaaran aisa hua he
 They do not say, but write blogs
 antarrashtriya paristhitiyaan to manmohan singh ke samay bhi thi
 But one thing has to be heard petrol ke daam bhale hi aitihaasik rup se sabase zyada ho gaye hai magar petrol pump se sarkaar dur nahin gai he
 Go to any petrol pump, as soon as the oil is filled out, the Prime Minister will be found in front
 koi aisa pump nahin he jahaan pradhanmantri kaa poster maujuud nahin he
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister is watching everything, so what to oppose the price of oil
 chalo bharaao or chupchaap nikal lo
 The price of gas does not reduce due to increase in prices
 pradhanmantri ke is poster ko dhyaan se dekhenge to samaj aayega
 Gas costs are 10-15 rupees a day
 maheene kaa 450
 It is important that the figure of 833 rupees is not accounted for on this poster
 pichley saal june main tay hua tha ki petrol deazal or gas ke daam har din tay honge
 There has never been as much increase in a single day as it has been on 7 September
 petrol kii keemat main 50 paise se adhik kii badhotaree hui he
 Petrol has become around 80 rupees in Delhi itself
 kai chote shaharon main to 87 se 89 rupee ke bich mil rahaa he
 Nobody is out there riding a bicycle
 2010 main to mahangaai ke khilaaf mahatma bhi aa gaye
 Did Mahatma really come to protest inflation? ab jab mahangaai kaaphi bad chuki he yahaan mahatma banakar aae ye paramatma indinon kya kar rahe honge
 India closed in July the same year
 kya left kya rhite sab usamen shaamil the
 BJP on the same platform CPM on the same platform
 upie kii sahyogi mamata banerjee bhi sadakon par utar gayi thi
 Everyday, he used to say that reduce the price, the public is dying
 mahangaai ne bijepi or left sabko ek kar diya tha
 Flashback is also the year 2010 on Friday when India closed in July
 usee saal ek film ai thi pipli live
 There is a difference of opinion among the scholars till date whether the film originated from the politics and media of India or from that film the truth of today's politics and media came out
 isi film ke ek gane ke saath mahangaai dian ho gai thi or har pradarsh main mahangaai dian hai hai ho rahaa tha
 These days inflation is more than that, but now he is not a witch, sweetheart
 vijay goyal
 Setting himself on a bike
 ek baar pozishan set hota he or goyal kaa bike kafila chal padataa he
 Vijay's rally sitting on the bike is properly covered, so the cameras are mounted on the roof of the car
 raily main kuch bhi ho saktaa he isliye puraani car lekar aae hai
 Nobody brings their new car
 raar, ikraar or takaraar kaa maahaul he
 Goyal has gone on a bike to seek resignation from Sheila Dixit
 1 sitambar 2013 ko dilli main petrol 74 rupee prati litre tha
 78 rupees 68 paise on 1 September 2018
 tabhi log pradarshan karne vaale in bikers ko khoj rahe hai
 Vijay Goyal has become a minister, but have these workers also progressed, are they not having any trouble in paying petrol for 79 rupees
 us samay rose press conference hua karti thi
 There were daily attacks from the bjp's side
 sarkaar kii taraf se rose bachaav hota tha
 The public was still the same, the public is still the same
 bas sarkaar main jo the wo vipaksh main hai or vipaksh main jo the wo sarkaar main hai
 Yashwant Sinha, who was in BJP till 2014, has left BJP
 unhone twit kiya ki petrol deazal ke daam bad rahe hai, vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 It seemed that they were also missing the opposition
 congress ne 10 sitambar ko bharat band kaa elaan kiya he
 Will she say something new or will she say what BJP used to say in the year of 2013
 petrol ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 People are being bothered
 balki log sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 When asked, someone is saying that there is a problem
 media ne is topic ko chhod diya he
 Now there is no failure of government due to increase in prices
 tab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami hoti thi
 What used to be performed day and night
 ham yah sab isliye dikhaa rahe hai taaki ab jab bhi petrol deazal ke daam ko lekar pradarshan ho to aapako lage ki are aisa to kahin dekha he, thik aisa hi kuch suna he lekin kahaan dekha he, kahaan suna he, kisase suna he or wo ab kahaan hai
 Our money
 agast 2013 main ek dollar 68 kaa hua tha, mudda ban gaya tha
 It is difficult to understand that now when a dollar has become 72 rupees, has the dignity of the government fallen, the dignity of the Prime Minister has fallen
 kya hua
 Was 2013 the year in politics when arguments ended
 yaa us saal ne bahut chaalaaki kii
 Recorded everything so that later it can be said that in politics, it is not always a logical thing to say
 netaa na vipaksh main hokar sahi bolte hai na sarkaar main jaakar sahi bolte hai
 Being in government does not make everyone government
 jo nahin hona hota he wo sarkaar main hone se bhi nahin hota he or nahin hone se bhi nahin hota he
 If you are looking for the opposition then find yourself first
 haa media badal gaya he
 The media no longer takes the opposition seriously
 tab vah vipaksh ko sarkaar se zyada mahatv detaa tha
 Used to go to him
 tab vah logon kii rasoi main jaataa tha
 Used to go to the fields to ask if inflation has increased then what a problem
 koi na koi to ab bhi jaataa hoga, hamaare reporter to ab bhi jate hai shaayad baakiyon ke bhi jate honge
 The comments petrol 80 rupee litre milane laga
 Diesel became expensive like petrol
 wo kab 80 rupee ho jayega pataa nahin
 The condition of the rupee is also weak
 magar wo baat nahin he jo tab hua karti thi
 People changed or the TV screen changed
 yah kaarykram un logon kii yaad main banaaya gaya he jo netaa nahin the or aaj bhi nahin hai magar netaaon ke bulaane par un reliyon main gaye the
 They were opposing the price of petrol diesel
 wo aaj kitne baichaiyn honge
 How much would we like to perform, but would not be able to go
 inamen best sichuation main hai navjot siddhu
 If you were in BJP, you had climbed on the elephant to protest inflation, now if you are in Congress, you can but Congress leader Kapil Sibbl is writing a book, when will he hit the road

 aag kii lapaton ke hawaale kar diya gaya yah moped
 He is the unsung hero of the history of protest against inflation, who could not even tell the agony of having or not having his insurance
 jala di gai bas ko yah bharosa rahaa hoga ki jal jane do sakhi, gar mere jalane se deazal phir kabhi mahangaa na hoga
 These people are so self-righteous
 khudargaz nahin hai inkaa gol clear he
 Moved from the heat of smoke because they know that we have come to burn tires, not to burn
 pleez aap log moped, bas or tair kii qurbaani yaad rakhie
 Never Forget
 hui peeche hat gaye
 They came to burn, not to burn
 mahangaai ke ye raajnneetik virdohi rajdhani express ke saamne hi chale ja rahe the
 The train knew that these people are the expresses at this time, they are not
 flashbek friday main ham yaad kar rahe hai 2010, 12 or 13 ke saal ko jab petrol or deazal ke daam badhate hi vipaksh bardaasht nahin karata tha
 Then when the price was 74 rupees a liter, Ravi Shankar Prasad used to go by bicycle, now when he is 80 rupees he is not cycling
 bijepi ke hi rameshwar chaurasia ne cycle kii sadhana kar lee thi, camere ke liye handle sambhaal liya magar ab inhen 80 yaa 89 rupee prati litre petrol se koi fark nahin padataa hoga
 He is the Chief Minister of Karnataka, Sadanand Gowda, when he is no longer, is cycling
 aaj jab petrol aitihaasik rup se mahangaa he ummid he unki wo vaali cycle abhi kaam main aati hogi
 We asked some people whether you are missing the 2012-13 protests against petrol prices
 agar aap miss kar rahe hai to flashbek friday zarur dekhie
 There are some basic duties of India's politics
 mahangaai ko bardaasht nahin karnaa he, bhale daam kam na ho lekin virodh karte rahanaa he
 There are many videos of BJP leaders protesting inflation in the library
 us samay jab petrol ke daam 74 rupee hote the to itihaas gavaah he ki bijepi ke netaaon ne pradarshan karne main koi aalasy nahin kiya he
 Many of the leaders involved in those demonstrations became ministers
 puraane pradarshan ke vijual main koi nahin kah saktaa ki sushamaa swaraj sirius nahin hai
 The old anger of the foreign minister's face is telling how much Sirius will be living on inflation
 ummid kerani chahie wo aaj bhi sirius hongi
 In their performance, these women are carrying the cylinder on the head
 media ke camaron ko thik se dikhe ki silendar kaa hi daam badha he isliye sar par silendar laade ye log sushamaa ji kii sabha main baithi hai
 Today, the subsidized cylinder is 833 rupees
 sitambar 2012 main bina sabsidi vaala silendar 750 rupaya kaa ho gaya tha
 The cylinders placed sideways in the kitchen were pulled from house to house on the streets
 jab bhi pradarshan hota tha koi na koi silendar liye chalaa aata tha
 Petrol and diesel have been run out
 nai sarkaar ai to antarashtriya bazaar main kachche tel kii keemat 115 dollar prati bairal se ghat kar 45-50 dollar prati bairal par aa gai
 Still there was no reduction in prices
 logon ne samajhnaa band kar diya ki 115 dollar prati bairal par petrol 74 rupee he to 46 dollars prati bairal par tel 70 rupee prati litre kyon he
 Now they do not understand that the price of crude oil is only 75 to 80 dollars per barrel, then how did petrol become 89 rupees per liter
 jabaki prati bairal kachche tel kii keemat 115 dollar bhi nahin hui he
 Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had told the economics formula in a demonstration at that time
 ab vahi jetali vitt mantri hai
 It is said that this has happened due to international circumstances
 kehete nahin balki blog likhte hai
 The international situation was also during the time of Manmohan Singh
 par ek baat kii daad deni hogi
 Although petrol prices have historically been the highest, but the government has not moved away from petrol pumps
 aap kisi bhi petrol pump par jaaiye, jaise hi tel bharaa kar niklenge, saamne pradhanmantri mil jaaenge
 There is no pump where the Prime Minister's poster is not present
 kai baar lagata he ki pradhanmantri ji sab dekh hi rahe hai to tel ke daam kaa kya virodh karnaa
 Let's fill it and leave quietly
 daam badhane se gas kaa phayda kam nahin ho jaataa
 If you watch this Prime Minister's poster carefully, you will understand
 gas kaa kharchaa roj kaa 10-15 rupaya kaa he
 450 of the month
 ye zaruri he ki 833 rupee waalon kaa hisaab is poster par nahin he
 It was decided in June last year that petrol diesel and gas prices would be fixed every day
 ek din main kabhi itani vruddhi nahin hui jitani 7 sitambar ko hui he
 The price of petrol has increased by more than 50 paise
 dilli main hi petrol kareeb 80 rupee kaa ho gaya he
 Many small cities are getting between 87 and 89 rupees
 vahaan par koi bhi cycle chalaakar pradarshan nahin kar rahaa he
 In 2010, Mahatma also came against inflation
 mahatma kya vaaki mahangaai kaa virodh karne aae the
 Now that inflation has increased a lot, what would these divine souls be doing these days who came here as Mahatmas
 usee saal july main bharat band hua tha
 What was left and right were all involved in it
 ek hi manch par bijepi ek hi manch par sipiem
 UPA ally Mamta Banerjee also took to the streets
 rose unka bayaan aata tha ki daam kam karo, janata mari ja rahi he
 Inflation united the BJP and the Left
 flashbek friday main saal 2010 bhi he jab july main bharat band hua tha
 The same year a film came in Peepli Live
 vidwaanon main aaj tak yah matbhed he ki vah film bharat kii raajnneeti or media kii god se nikali thi yaa us film se aaj kii raajnneeti or media kaa satya niklaa tha
 Inflation became witchy with a song from the same film and inflation witch was happening in every performance
 in dinon mahangaai usase zyada he magar ab vah dian nahin, jaanam he
 Vijay Goel
 khud ko bike par set karte hue
 Once the position is set and Goyal's bike convoy moves
 bike par baithe vijay kii raily thik se cover ho, iske liye camere vaale car kii chat par savaar hai
 Anything can happen in the rally, so have brought old cars
 koi apni nai car lekar nahin aata he
 There is an atmosphere of rar, iqarar and wrangling
 goyal bike par chadhakar shila dikshit se istipha maangane gaye hai
 Petrol in Delhi was Rs 74 per liter on 1 September 2013
 1 sitambar 2018 ko 78 rupee 68 paise ho gaya
 That's why people are looking for these performing bikers
 vijay goyal to mantri ho gaye lekin kya in kaaryakartaaon kii bhi tarakkee ho gai he, kya unhen 79 rupee petrol bharaane main zaraa bhi takalif nahin ho rahi he
 There used to be a daily press conference at that time
 bijepi kii taraf se rose hamale hote the
 There was daily rescue from the government
 janata tab bhi vahi thi janata ab bhi vahi he
 Just those who were in the government are in the opposition and those who were in the opposition are in the government
 2014 se pehle tak bijepi main rahe yashavanth sinha ne bijepi chhod di he
 He tweeted that the prices of petrol diesel are going up, what is the opposition doing
 aisa laga ki ve bhi vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai
 The Congress has declared a Bharat Bandh on 10 September
 kya wo kuch nayaa kahegi yaa phir vahi kahegi jo bijepi 2013 ke saal main kaha karti thi
 Petrol prices are increasing
 log sehate ja rahe hai
 Rather, people are becoming comfortable
 poochne par koi kah rahaa he ki takalif he
 The media has left this topic
 ab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami nahin hoti he
 Then the government used to fail due to increase in prices
 kya din kya raat pradarshan hi pradarshan hua karte the
 We are showing all this so that whenever there is a demonstration regarding the price of petrol diesel, you will feel that you have seen something like this, you have heard something similar but where have you seen, where have you heard, whom have you heard and that Where are you now hamaara rupaya
 a dollar 68 was raised in August 2013, becoming the issue
 samajhnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki ab jab ek dollar 72 rupye kaa ho gaya to kya sarkaar kii garima gir gai, pradhanmantri kii garima gir gai
 What happened
 kya raajnneeti main 2013 kaa saal tarkon ke khatm hone kaa saal tha
 Or that year did a lot of trickery
 sabakuch record kar liya taaki baad main bataa sake ki raajnneeti main hameshaa taarkik baat nahin kahi jaati he
 Leaders do not speak right in opposition or go right in government
 sarkaar main hone se sab sarkaar nahin ho jate hai
 What does not have to happen does not happen by being in the government and it does not happen either
 baaki aap vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai to pehle khud ko bhi khojie
 Yes the media has changed
 media ab vipaksh ko gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 Then he gave more importance to the opposition than the government
 uske paas jaataa tha
 Then he used to go to people's kitchen
 kheton main jaataa tha poochne ke liye ki mahangaai badi he to kya takalif he
 Some one must still go, our reporters still go and may have gone to others
 tippaniyan Petrol started getting 80 rupees a liter
 deazal petrol kii tarah mahangaa ho gaya
 Don't know when it will be 80 rupees
 rupee kii haalat bhi kamazor he
 But that is not what used to happen then
 log badal gaye yaa phir tivi kaa screen badal gaya
 This program has been made in the memory of those who were not leaders and are not even today but went to those rallies after the leaders were called
 petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh kar rahe the
 They will be so restless today
 kitna man karata hoga ki chalo pradarshan karte hai magar ja nahin pate honge
 Among them, Navjot Sidhu is in the best situation
 bijepi main the to hathi par chadhakar mahangaai kaa virodh karne gaye the, ab congress main hai to kar hi sakate hai lekin congress ke netaa kapil sibabl to kitaab likh rahe hai, sadak par kab utrenge
 In Flashback Friday, we remember the years of 2010, 12 and 13, when the opposition did not tolerate the rise in prices of petrol and diesel
 tab jab daam 74 rupee litre tha ravishankar prasad cycle se chale the, ab jab 80 rupee he ve cycle se nahin chal rahe hai
 Rameshwar Chaurasia of BJP had done the cycle work, took the handle for the camera, but now he will not make any difference from Rs 80 or 89 per liter of petrol
 ye karnataka ke mukhyamantri hai sadanand gauda, tab the ab nahin hai, cycle chalaa rahe hai
 Today, when petrol is historically expensive, it is expected that their bicycle will still be useful
 hamane kuch logon se poocha ki kya aap petrol ke daam ke khilaaf 2012-13 ke pradarshnon ko miss kar rahe hai
 If you're missing out, check out Flashback Friday
 bharat kii raajnneeti ke kuch mul katarvy hai
 Do not tolerate inflation, even if the price is not low, but keep opposing
 librari main mahangaai kaa virodh karte hue bijepi netaaon ke khub video hai
 At that time when petrol price was 74 rupees then history is witness that BJP leaders have not done any laziness in demonstrating
 un pradarshnon main jitne netaa shaamil the, unamem se kai mantri ban gaye
 In the visual of the old performance, no one can say that Sushma Swaraj is not a Sirius
 videsh mantri ke chehre kaa purana gussa bataa rahaa he ki wo mahangaai ko lekar kitni sirius rahati hongi
 Hopefully she will still be Sirius today
 unke pradarshan main sar par silendar laade ye mahilaayein chali aa rahi hai
 The media cameras should see that the price of the cylinder has increased so these people are sitting in Sushma ji's meeting
 aaj bina sabsidi vaala silendar 833 rupee kaa he
 In September 2012, the non-subsidized cylinder became Rs 750
 rasoi main kinare rakhe silendar ko ghar ghar se khinch kar sadakon par laayaa gaya tha
 Whenever there was a demonstration, there was a cylinder
 petrol or deazal belgaum ho chukaa he
 When the new government came, the price of crude oil in the international market fell from $ 115 per barrel to $ 45-50 per barrel
 phir bhi keemton main koi kami nahin hui
 People stopped understanding that petrol is Rs 74 at $ 115 per barrel, so why is oil at Rs 70 per liter at $ 46 per barrel
 ab unhen samaj nahin aa rahaa he ki kachche tel kii keemat to sirf 75 se 80 dollar prati bairal he phir petrol 89 rupee prati litre kaise ho gaya
 While the price of crude oil per barrel is not even $ 115
 vitt mantri arun jetali ne us vakt ek pradarshan main arthshaastra kaa formula bataaya tha
 Now Jaitley is the Finance Minister
 kehete hai ki antarrashtriya paristhitiyon ke kaaran aisa hua he
 They do not say, but write blogs
 antarrashtriya paristhitiyaan to manmohan singh ke samay bhi thi
 But one thing has to be heard petrol ke daam bhale hi aitihaasik rup se sabase zyada ho gaye hai magar petrol pump se sarkaar dur nahin gai he
 Go to any petrol pump, as soon as the oil is filled out, the Prime Minister will be found in front
 koi aisa pump nahin he jahaan pradhanmantri kaa poster maujuud nahin he
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister is watching everything, so what to oppose the price of oil
 chalo bharaao or chupchaap nikal lo
 The price of gas does not reduce due to increase in prices
 pradhanmantri ke is poster ko dhyaan se dekhenge to samaj aayega
 Gas costs are 10-15 rupees a day
 maheene kaa 450
 It is important that the figure of 833 rupees is not accounted for on this poster
 pichley saal june main tay hua tha ki petrol deazal or gas ke daam har din tay honge
 There has never been as much increase in a single day as it has been on 7 September
 petrol kii keemat main 50 paise se adhik kii badhotaree hui he
 Petrol has become around 80 rupees in Delhi itself
 kai chote shaharon main to 87 se 89 rupee ke bich mil rahaa he
 Nobody is out there riding a bicycle
 2010 main to mahangaai ke khilaaf mahatma bhi aa gaye
 Did Mahatma really come to protest inflation? ab jab mahangaai kaaphi bad chuki he yahaan mahatma banakar aae ye paramatma indinon kya kar rahe honge
 India closed in July the same year
 kya left kya rhite sab usamen shaamil the
 BJP on the same platform CPM on the same platform
 upie kii sahyogi mamata banerjee bhi sadakon par utar gayi thi
 Everyday, he used to say that reduce the price, the public is dying
 mahangaai ne bijepi or left sabko ek kar diya tha
 Flashback is also the year 2010 on Friday when India closed in July
 usee saal ek film ai thi pipli live
 There is a difference of opinion among the scholars till date whether the film originated from the politics and media of India or from that film the truth of today's politics and media came out
 isi film ke ek gane ke saath mahangaai dian ho gai thi or har pradarsh main mahangaai dian hai hai ho rahaa tha
 These days inflation is more than that, but now he is not a witch, sweetheart
 vijay goyal
 Setting himself on a bike
 ek baar pozishan set hota he or goyal kaa bike kafila chal padataa he
 Vijay's rally sitting on the bike is properly covered, so the cameras are mounted on the roof of the car
 raily main kuch bhi ho saktaa he isliye puraani car lekar aae hai
 Nobody brings their new car
 raar, ikraar or takaraar kaa maahaul he
 Goyal has gone on a bike to seek resignation from Sheila Dixit
 1 sitambar 2013 ko dilli main petrol 74 rupee prati litre tha
 78 rupees 68 paise on 1 September 2018
 tabhi log pradarshan karne vaale in bikers ko khoj rahe hai
 Vijay Goyal has become a minister, but have these workers also progressed, are they not having any trouble in paying petrol for 79 rupees
 us samay rose press conference hua karti thi
 There were daily attacks from the bjp's side
 sarkaar kii taraf se rose bachaav hota tha
 The public was still the same, the public is still the same
 bas sarkaar main jo the wo vipaksh main hai or vipaksh main jo the wo sarkaar main hai
 Yashwant Sinha, who was in BJP till 2014, has left BJP
 unhone twit kiya ki petrol deazal ke daam bad rahe hai, vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 It seemed that they were also missing the opposition
 congress ne 10 sitambar ko bharat band kaa elaan kiya he
 Will she say something new or will she say what BJP used to say in the year of 2013
 petrol ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 People are being bothered
 balki log sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 When asked, someone is saying that there is a problem
 media ne is topic ko chhod diya he
 Now there is no failure of government due to increase in prices
 tab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami hoti thi
 What used to be performed day and night
 ham yah sab isliye dikhaa rahe hai taaki ab jab bhi petrol deazal ke daam ko lekar pradarshan ho to aapako lage ki are aisa to kahin dekha he, thik aisa hi kuch suna he lekin kahaan dekha he, kahaan suna he, kisase suna he or wo ab kahaan hai
 Our money
 agast 2013 main ek dollar 68 kaa hua tha, mudda ban gaya tha
 It is difficult to understand that now when a dollar has become 72 rupees, has the dignity of the government fallen, the dignity of the Prime Minister has fallen
 kya hua
 Was 2013 the year in politics when arguments ended
 yaa us saal ne bahut chaalaaki kii
 Recorded everything so that later it can be said that in politics, it is not always a logical thing to say
 netaa na vipaksh main hokar sahi bolte hai na sarkaar main jaakar sahi bolte hai
 Being in government does not make everyone government
 jo nahin hona hota he wo sarkaar main hone se bhi nahin hota he or nahin hone se bhi nahin hota he
 If you are looking for the opposition then find yourself first
 haa media badal gaya he
 The media no longer takes the opposition seriously
 tab vah vipaksh ko sarkaar se zyada mahatv detaa tha
 Used to go to him
 tab vah logon kii rasoi main jaataa tha
 Used to go to the fields to ask if inflation has increased then what a problem
 koi na koi to ab bhi jaataa hoga, hamaare reporter to ab bhi jate hai shaayad baakiyon ke bhi jate honge
 The comments petrol 80 rupee litre milane laga
 Diesel became expensive like petrol
 wo kab 80 rupee ho jayega pataa nahin
 The condition of the rupee is also weak
 magar wo baat nahin he jo tab hua karti thi
 People changed or the TV screen changed
 yah kaarykram un logon kii yaad main banaaya gaya he jo netaa nahin the or aaj bhi nahin hai magar netaaon ke bulaane par un reliyon main gaye the
 They were opposing the price of petrol diesel
 wo aaj kitne baichaiyn honge
 How much would we like to perform, but would not be able to go
 inamen best sichuation main hai navjot siddhu

 Still there was no reduction in prices

 Now they do not understand that the price of crude oil is only 75 to 80 dollars per barrel, then how did petrol become 89 rupees per liter

 Go to any petrol pump, as soon as the oil is filled out, the Prime Minister will be found in front
 koi aisa pump nahin he jahaan pradhanmantri kaa poster maujuud nahin he
 At times, it seems that the Prime Minister is watching everything, so what to oppose the price of oil
 chalo bharaao or chupchaap nikal lo
 The price of gas does not reduce due to increase in prices
 pradhanmantri ke is poster ko dhyaan se dekhenge to samaj aayega
 Gas costs are 10-15 rupees a day
 maheene kaa 450
 It is important that the figure of 833 rupees is not accounted for on this poster
 pichley saal june main tay hua tha ki petrol deazal or gas ke daam har din tay honge
 There has never been as much increase in a single day as it has been on 7 September
 petrol kii keemat main 50 paise se adhik kii badhotaree hui he
 Petrol has become around 80 rupees in Delhi itself
 kai chote shaharon main to 87 se 89 rupee ke bich mil rahaa he
 Nobody is out there riding a bicycle
 2010 main to mahangaai ke khilaaf mahatma bhi aa gaye
 Did Mahatma really come to protest inflation? ab jab mahangaai kaaphi bad chuki he yahaan mahatma banakar aae ye paramatma indinon kya kar rahe honge
 India closed in July the same year
 kya left kya rhite sab usamen shaamil the
 BJP on the same platform CPM on the same platform
 upie kii sahyogi mamata banerjee bhi sadakon par utar gayi thi
 Everyday, he used to say that reduce the price, the public is dying
 mahangaai ne bijepi or left sabko ek kar diya tha
 Flashback is also the year 2010 on Friday when India closed in July
 usee saal ek film ai thi pipli live
 There is a difference of opinion among the scholars till date whether the film originated from the politics and media of India or from that film the truth of today's politics and media came out
 isi film ke ek gane ke saath mahangaai dian ho gai thi or har pradarsh main mahangaai dian hai hai ho rahaa tha
 These days inflation is more than that, but now he is not a witch, sweetheart
 vijay goyal
 Setting himself on a bike
 ek baar pozishan set hota he or goyal kaa bike kafila chal padataa he
 Vijay's rally sitting on the bike is properly covered, so the cameras are mounted on the roof of the car
 raily main kuch bhi ho saktaa he isliye puraani car lekar aae hai
 Nobody brings their new car
 raar, ikraar or takaraar kaa maahaul he
 Goyal has gone on a bike to seek resignation from Sheila Dixit
 1 sitambar 2013 ko dilli main petrol 74 rupee prati litre tha
 78 rupees 68 paise on 1 September 2018
 tabhi log pradarshan karne vaale in bikers ko khoj rahe hai
 Vijay Goyal has become a minister, but have these workers also progressed, are they not having any trouble in paying petrol for 79 rupees
 us samay rose press conference hua karti thi
 There were daily attacks from the bjp's side
 sarkaar kii taraf se rose bachaav hota tha
 The public was still the same, the public is still the same
 bas sarkaar main jo the wo vipaksh main hai or vipaksh main jo the wo sarkaar main hai
 Yashwant Sinha, who was in BJP till 2014, has left BJP
 unhone twit kiya ki petrol deazal ke daam bad rahe hai, vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 It seemed that they were also missing the opposition
 congress ne 10 sitambar ko bharat band kaa elaan kiya he
 Will she say something new or will she say what BJP used to say in the year of 2013
 petrol ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 People are being bothered
 balki log sahaj hote ja rahe hai
 When asked, someone is saying that there is a problem
 media ne is topic ko chhod diya he
 Now there is no failure of government due to increase in prices
 tab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami hoti thi
 What used to be performed day and night
 ham yah sab isliye dikhaa rahe hai taaki ab jab bhi petrol deazal ke daam ko lekar pradarshan ho to aapako lage ki are aisa to kahin dekha he, thik aisa hi kuch suna he lekin kahaan dekha he, kahaan suna he, kisase suna he or wo ab kahaan hai
 Our money
 agast 2013 main ek dollar 68 kaa hua tha, mudda ban gaya tha
 It is difficult to understand that now when a dollar has become 72 rupees, has the dignity of the government fallen, the dignity of the Prime Minister has fallen
 kya hua
 Was 2013 the year in politics when arguments ended
 yaa us saal ne bahut chaalaaki kii
 Recorded everything so that later it can be said that in politics, it is not always a logical thing to say
 netaa na vipaksh main hokar sahi bolte hai na sarkaar main jaakar sahi bolte hai
 Being in government does not make everyone government
 jo nahin hona hota he wo sarkaar main hone se bhi nahin hota he or nahin hone se bhi nahin hota he
 If you are looking for the opposition then find yourself first
 haa media badal gaya he
 The media no longer takes the opposition seriously
 tab vah vipaksh ko sarkaar se zyada mahatv detaa tha
 Used to go to him
 tab vah logon kii rasoi main jaataa tha
 Used to go to the fields to ask if inflation has increased then what a problem
 koi na koi to ab bhi jaataa hoga, hamaare reporter to ab bhi jate hai shaayad baakiyon ke bhi jate honge
 The comments petrol 80 rupee litre milane laga
 Diesel became expensive like petrol
 wo kab 80 rupee ho jayega pataa nahin
 The condition of the rupee is also weak
 magar wo baat nahin he jo tab hua karti thi
 People changed or the TV screen changed
 yah kaarykram un logon kii yaad main banaaya gaya he jo netaa nahin the or aaj bhi nahin hai magar netaaon ke bulaane par un reliyon main gaye the
 They were opposing the price of petrol diesel
 wo aaj kitne baichaiyn honge
 How much would we like to perform, but would not be able to go
 inamen best sichuation main hai navjot siddhu
 If you were in BJP, you had climbed on the elephant to protest inflation, now if you are in Congress, you can but Congress leader Kapil Sibbl is writing a book, when will he hit the road
 pichley saal june main tay hua tha ki petrol deazal or gas ke daam har din tay honge

 The public was still the same, the public is still the same
 bas sarkaar main jo the wo vipaksh main hai or vipaksh main jo the wo sarkaar main hai
 Yashwant Sinha, who was in BJP till 2014, has left BJP
 unhone twit kiya ki petrol deazal ke daam bad rahe hai, vipaksh kya kar rahaa he
 It seemed that they were also missing the opposition
 congress ne 10 sitambar ko bharat band kaa elaan kiya he
 Will she say something new or will she say what BJP used to say in the year of 2013
 petrol ke daam badhate ja rahe hai
 People are being bothered

 Our money

 It is difficult to understand that now when a dollar has become 72 rupees, has the dignity of the government fallen, the dignity of the Prime Minister has fallen
 kya hua
 Was 2013 the year in politics when arguments ended
 yaa us saal ne bahut chaalaaki kii
 Recorded everything so that later it can be said that in politics, it is not always a logical thing to say

 Being in government does not make everyone government

 If you are looking for the opposition then find yourself first

 Flashback is also the year 2010 on Friday when India closed in July
 usee saal ek film ai thi pipli live
 There is a difference of opinion among the scholars till date whether the film originated from the politics and media of India or from that film the truth of today's politics and media came out

 Vijay Goel
 khud ko bike par set karte hue
 Once the position is set and Goyal's bike convoy moves
 bike par baithe vijay kii raily thik se cover ho, iske liye camere vaale car kii chat par savaar hai
 Anything can happen in the rally, so have brought old cars
 koi apni nai car lekar nahin aata he
 There is an atmosphere of rar, iqarar and wrangling
 goyal bike par chadhakar shila dikshit se istipha maangane gaye hai
 Petrol in Delhi was Rs 74 per liter on 1 September 2013
 1 sitambar 2018 ko 78 rupee 68 paise ho gaya
 That's why people are looking for these performing bikers
 vijay goyal to mantri ho gaye lekin kya in kaaryakartaaon kii bhi tarakkee ho gai he, kya unhen 79 rupee petrol bharaane main zaraa bhi takalif nahin ho rahi he
 There used to be a daily press conference at that time
 bijepi kii taraf se rose hamale hote the
 There was daily rescue from the government
 janata tab bhi vahi thi janata ab bhi vahi he
 Just those who were in the government are in the opposition and those who were in the opposition are in the government
 2014 se pehle tak bijepi main rahe yashavanth sinha ne bijepi chhod di he
 He tweeted that the prices of petrol diesel are going up, what is the opposition doing
 aisa laga ki ve bhi vipaksh ko miss kar rahe hai
 The Congress has declared a Bharat Bandh on 10 September
 kya wo kuch nayaa kahegi yaa phir vahi kahegi jo bijepi 2013 ke saal main kaha karti thi
 Petrol prices are increasing
 log sehate ja rahe hai
 Rather, people are becoming comfortable
 poochne par koi kah rahaa he ki takalif he
 The media has left this topic
 ab daam badhane se sarkaar kii naakaami nahin hoti he
 Then the government used to fail due to increase in prices
 kya din kya raat pradarshan hi pradarshan hua karte the
 We are showing all this so that whenever there is a demonstration regarding the price of petrol diesel, you will feel that you have seen something like this, you have heard something similar but where have you seen, where have you heard, whom have you heard and that Where are you now hamaara rupaya
 a dollar 68 was raised in August 2013, becoming the issue
 samajhnaa mushkil ho rahaa he ki ab jab ek dollar 72 rupye kaa ho gaya to kya sarkaar kii garima gir gai, pradhanmantri kii garima gir gai
 What happened
 kya raajnneeti main 2013 kaa saal tarkon ke khatm hone kaa saal tha
 Or that year did a lot of trickery
 sabakuch record kar liya taaki baad main bataa sake ki raajnneeti main hameshaa taarkik baat nahin kahi jaati he
 Leaders do not speak right in opposition or go right in government
 sarkaar main hone se sab sarkaar nahin ho jate hai
 What does not have to happen does not happen by being in the government and it does not happen either
 baaki aap vipaksh ko khoj rahe hai to pehle khud ko bhi khojie
 Yes the media has changed
 media ab vipaksh ko gambhirtha se nahin letaa
 Then he gave more importance to the opposition than the government
 uske paas jaataa tha
 Then he used to go to people's kitchen
 kheton main jaataa tha poochne ke liye ki mahangaai badi he to kya takalif he
 Some one must still go, our reporters still go and may have gone to others
 tippaniyan Petrol started getting 80 rupees a liter
 deazal petrol kii tarah mahangaa ho gaya
 Don't know when it will be 80 rupees

 But that is not what used to happen then

 This program has been made in the memory of those who were not leaders and are not even today but went to those rallies after the leaders were called
 petrol deazal ke daam kaa virodh kar rahe the
 They will be so restless today
 kitna man karata hoga ki chalo pradarshan karte hai magar ja nahin pate honge
 Among them, Navjot Sidhu is in the best situation
 bijepi main the to hathi par chadhakar mahangaai kaa virodh karne gaye the, ab congress main hai to kar hi sakate hai lekin congress ke netaa kapil sibabl to kitaab likh rahe hai, sadak par kab utrenge

 Sources say that in Lalit's dream one day the father came and told him not to worry, his voice would return soon

 Then, in the dream, Lalit started seeing his father

 Party leader in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary tweeted, "neither Rahul ji nor Congress has made any demand for a first line seat in Parliament
 hamane unke liye seat sankhya 466 kaa prastaav diya he
 Significantly, it was said in some reports that Congress has demanded allotment of first-line seat in Parliament for Rahul Gandhi

 a post shared by Viral Bhayani (@viralbhayani) on Sep 22, 2018 at 3:58 am pdtan opportunity to give competition to the Kardashians just went wasted! a week back i mentioned about 'my badge of honor' that i was going to receive
 And i did and am happy to share about it with the intention of it being received with love
 As that's the only reason i am posting it
 Love for self and gratitude for the universe
 The picture might be disturbing for some, but these drains have become my dumbells for a few days
 i was detected with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) in my right breast with high grade malignant cells
 Simply put stage 0 cancer / pre-cancerous stage, with cancer cells multiplying in an contained area
 The result i have become a half Indian version of Angelina Jolie (since only one breast was involved)! i told my doctor now is the time to give some competition to the Kardashians since Pamela is passé
 But no one listened to me, so now i have a portion of my back tissue in my breast
 Perhaps now i can do chin-ups with my breasts! Jokes apart, this obstacle has given me a new definition of life
 Respect it's unpredictability and have the faith and courage to be the hero of your own drama of life
 The invincible human spirit is God like, gives you the courage to endure and the will to revive
 There is nothing that human spirit can't do
 Also i want women of all ages to be aware
 i am 35, and i was returned twice over from a mammogram
 If any symptoms come up, think of it as a protective force and get yourselves examined
 Also we are so obsessed with boobs
 This mastectomy has left me with even more self love! Big, small, left or right inclined , gravity pulling or defying, or even none, each breast the presence or lack of it has a story to tell
 Mine has made me a 2
 0 version of myself! This post is dedicated to awareness, self love and resilience of a warrior that i know each one of us possesses # breastcancerawareness # selflove # determination # faith # bodhisattva # bodhisattvaoftheeartha post shared by tahirakashyap (@tahirakashyap) on Sep 22, 2018 at 1:59am PDT In Alwar, Rajasthan, the case of murder of a man on the charge of cow smuggling was not yet stopped that once again the police arrested a young man on the charge of cow smuggling

 He was just 11 years old when he started eating mud and now he is addicted to mud
 usne bataaya ki vah roj din main ek kilo naa khaane vaali chijen kha letaa he
 Childhood cut in poverty, then cut hands, but now successful businessman, he told that i was too fed up with my shortage of money, i had to feed 10 children
 main maranaa chahta tha, lekin maine keechad khaanaa shuru kar diya
 Later this habit started to develop in me and i started eating 1 kg of mud every day
 or ab main is aadat ko nahin chhod saktaa
 Raised money by polishing shoes, now made for the poor
 Hospital is absolutely healthy and healthy Karu Paswan
 His elder son Siyaram Paswan told that every member of the family asked him to quit this habit, but he never heard
 vah kabhi kahin to kabhi kahin se mitti kaa tukdaa uthaa kar khaane lagata he
 It would be surprising to know that Karu Paswan is healthy and healthy even after eating mud for so long
 unhen is aadat ke liye bihar ne aword bhi diya gaya he
 In Bihar, the NDA allies, LJP, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party and Hindustani Awam Morcha have intensified their demand for seat sharing, but BJP seems to be in no hurry to share
 party pehle bhagalpur main pradhanmantri narendra modi kii raily nipta lenaa chaahati he or uske baad hi seat bantwaare ko tavajjo dena chaahati he
 However, it may also happen that seats are divided in the NDA only after the announcement of election dates
 vaiseesiton ke khinchataan ko lekar andar kii jang shuruho chuki he, iske saaf sanket milane lage hai
 Apparently the BJP must have made a special plan to deal with it
 aaie samajhate hai siton ke bantwaare ko lekar aakhir kya he bijepi kaa gemplan-1)ek sitambar ko bhagalpur main pradhanmantri kii raily bijepi ke liye abhi takabihar main hui tamaam releyonmen bheed jutaney ke lihaaj se shaayad sabase kathinaayee vaali raily hone vaali he
 Also, there will be a psychological pressure to compete against nitish-lalu's self-respect rally on 30 August
 bhagalpur kii raily mukhya taur par munger or bhagalpur pramandalon ko dhyaan main rakhkar yojit kii gai he
 In the era of coalition politics, bjp's allies have traditionally received more seats in this part of eastern Bihar or Anga Pradesh
 lihaaja bijepi in ilaakon main apekshaakrit kam siton par front par aakar chunaav ladati rahi
 There is a natural laxity in the workers by not contesting the party elections for many consecutive years
 pichley saal vidhansabha ke liye hue upachunaav main bhale hi baankaa kii seat bijepi ne waapas jeet lee ho, lekin bhagalpur kii dashakon puraani seat par bijepi ko congress se shikast jhelni padi thi
 The defeat of Bhagalpur assembly seat after the defeat of Shahnawaz Hussain in the Lok Sabha elections had a profound effect on the morale of the BJP
 lihaaja bheed jutaney ke paimaane par 1 sitambar ko bijepi or uske teenon sahyogi dalon kii pariksha hone vaali he
 While deciding how many seats to give to the three parties, the BJP will definitely calculate the crowd gathered in this rally
 2)ramvilas paswan kii lok janashakti party or upendra kushvaha kii rashtriya lok samta party ke saath loksabhaa chunaav main seat bantwaare main koi dikkat nahin ai thi
 At that time, the Modi wave had crossed everyone's eyes, but circumstances have changed in the assembly elections
 paswan or kushvaha donon kii mahatvakankshaayen bad gai hai to duusari ore dilli haarane ke baad bijepi ke liye bihar chunaav jivan-maran kaa prashn bana hua he
 The BJP is not in favor of giving equal importance to Paswan and Kushwaha
 algepi ko to phir bhi ek nishchit (dalit) aadhaar vaali party hone ke naate kuch zyada siten mil sakati hai, lekin araspi ko bijepi ke pradesh or rashtriya str ke netaa zyada bhav dene ke mood main nahin hai
 The BJP believes that Upendra Kushwaha does not have many options even if he does not get the desired seats
 nitish se jabardast takaraav ke baad jediu se nikle kushvaha waapas mahagathbandhan kii raah nahin pakad sakate, bijepi kaa saath chhootane par centre kaa mantripad bhi jaataa rahegaa
 Being a small and relatively new party, they neither have the manpower nor the money force to contest elections alone
 aise main endie se alag hone kaa faisla unke raajnneetik kariyar ke liye baari jokhim bharaa ho saktaa he
 The BJP fears that in the seats where the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party candidate will stand, if Nitish Kumar's JDU candidate is in front of it, the voters will vote in favor of JDU instead of Rashtriya Lok Samata Party
 aise main jediu ko shuddh laabh or endie ko shuddh haani kii ashanka he
 Such a situation will certainly not be auspicious for the BJP in a thorn-laden election environment
 abhi haal hi bihar vidhaan parishad kii 24 siton ke chunaav main bhi rashtriya lok samta party khaataa tak nahin khol pai thi
 Last year, there were some attempts to merge the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party with the BJP, but the BJP was not successful in this
 agar safalataa mil gai hoti to bijepi ke liye aaj jaise mushkil halaat paidaa nahin hote

 At the time when Raj Babbar was targeting the BJP through the 'son model', at the same time, the spokesperson of the Yogi Adityanath government of UP and cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh were reminding the Congress of the 'son-in-law model'
 siddharthanath singh ne congress par palatwaar karte hue kaha, "congress ke paas koi mudda nahin he, isliye vah bijepi adhyaksh kii chhavi dhoomil karne kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 Congress should clarify on the 'damad model'

 sankhya bhale hi choti kyon na ho, lekin centre main upie sarkaar ko banane yaa bigaadpee main inaki bhoomika jarur hogi
 Especially in a situation when Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has withdrawn support and it is reported that Mulayam Singh also wants an early election

 The festival of Makar Sankranti is considered one of the major festivals in Hinduism
 surya ke ek raashi se duusari raashi main pravesh karne ko sankrati kehete hai
 This festival is celebrated on the fourteenth day of the month of January
 surya jab makar raashi main pravesh karata he, tab makar sankranti hoti he
 In this way there are 12 Sankranti in total in the year, because the Sun changes the zodiac every month
 lekin inamen se chaar sankranti mahatvapurn hai jinamein mesh, kark, tula, makar sankranti shaamil hai
 Why Khichdi is eaten on Makar Sankranti? On the day of Makar Sankranti, making and eating khichdi with different dishes has special significance
 isi kaaran is parv ko kai jagahon par khichdi kaa parv bhi kaha jaataa he
 Actually, rice is considered to be the emblem of Kochndramaka and Urad's pulse is that of Shani
 hari subjiyan budh se sambandh rakhti hai
 It is believed that summer of khichdi is associated with Mars and Sun
 isliye makar sankranti ke din khichdi khaane se raashi main grahon kii sthiti majboot hoti he
 It is said that on this day, eating a piece of new food provides health throughout the year
 makar sankranti kedinkhichadi khaane kii aisi bhi manyata he ki khilji ke akraman ke dauraan baba gorakhnath ke yogi khaanaa nahin bana pate the or bhukhe rahane kii vajah se har dhalate din ke saath kamjor ho rahe the
 Seeing the deteriorating condition of the yogis, Baba advised his yogis to cook rice, lentils and vegetables
 yah bhojan kam samay main taiyaar ho jaataa tha or isse yogiyon ko urja bhi milti thi
 Baba Gorakhnath gave the name of Khichdi to this meal made from lentils, rice and vegetables
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bhi makar sankranti ke parv par gorakhpur main sthit baba gorakhnath ke mandir ke paas khichdi kaa mela lagata he
 During this time Baba is specially offered khichdi

 pakistan ko saunpi gai bhagodon kii suchi main shaamil vajahul qamar khan ke bare main yah jaankaree mili ki vah mumbai ke upnagareey ilaake pune main rahata he
 Significantly, Khan was arrested last year for his alleged role in the 2003 Mulund train blast case

 mujhe nahin lagata ki hamen ise bada mudda bananaa chahie
 It is possible that a mistake may have occurred or there may have been two people of the same name

 On the other hand, official sources said that an inquiry has been ordered about how Khan's name got included in the list

 The list was submitted to Pakistan in March and made public last week
 gauratlab he ki is suchi ko maharashtra police, rashtriya jaanch agency or sibiai ke paraamarsh se taiyaar kiya gaya he
 During the course of the investigation, the entire process adopted at various stages in preparing this list will be investigated and the officials responsible for including the name of the mine will be traced

" ’is bich, maharashtra bhaajapa ne kaha he ki patil ko is mudde par spashtikaran dena chahie
 BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said that the revelation has put a big question mark on the credibility of the Mumbai Police and especially the Maharashtra government
 is mudde par khan ne kaha ki vah yah jaanakar stabdh rah gaya ki uskaa naam 50 sarvaadhik vaanchhiton kii suchi main shaamil he
 Khan (44) told, 'I have been living in Thane for years and how did he include my name in the list of most wanted which has been submitted to Pakistan
 mujhe police adhikariyon se milane ko kaha gaya he
 'khan does the business of zari
 uske paas ek passport tha, jo kuch samay pehle kho gaya
 He told that he has never been to Pakistan
 khan ne kaha, ‘main sabhi maamalon main bekasoor hum

 He said that the final decision in this regard would be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs
 unhone kaha ki 15 karod alpiji upabhoktaaon main se 89 fisadi saal main nau silendaron kaa upyog karte hai or sirf 10 fisadi ko atirikt silendar bazaar bhav par khareednaa padataa he
 If the quota is increased, 97 percent consumers will get the benefit of subsidized LPG
 unhone kaha, 'yadi yah prastaav aata he, to hamen iske laabh haani kaa vichaar karnaa hoga
 The decision is ultimately to be taken to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs or the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs
 'sabsidi vaale silendaron kii sankhya badhaakar 12 karne se eendhan sabsidi 3,300 karod rupee se 5,800 karod rupee tak bad jayega
 North Korea, which has consistently plagued the world by conducting nuclear tests, has once warned of nuclear testing
 uttar korea ne chetaya he ki vah apane netritv kii chuni hui ‘kisi bhi jagah or kisi bhi samay’’parmaanu pareekshan kar saktaa he
 There has been an ongoing speculation for a long time that North Korea is preparing for a long-range missile test or the seventh nuclear test
 udhar america iske jawaab main kisi sainya hamale kii ashanka ko khaarij karne se inkaar kar rahaa he
 All this has caused tension in the Korean peninsula for several weeks
 uttar korian videsh mantralay ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha ki unka desh america kii taraf se uthaae jane vaale kisi bhi kadam kaa jawaab dene ke liye ‘‘puri tarah taiyaar he
 According to a report by KCNA, the North Korean government dialogue committee, the spokesman said that until the US ends its ambiguous policies, their government will continue to increase its nuclear deterrence capability
 uttar korea ne pichley 11 saal main paanch parmaanu pareekshan kiye hai or mana jaataa he ki vah america tak parmaanu hathiyaaron ko pahunchane kii kshamta vaali missile banane kii disha main pragati kar rahaa he
 Let me tell you that recently US President Donald Trump made a big statement about North Korea
 trump ne kaha tha ki missile or parmaanu pareekshan muddon ko lekar uttar korea ke saath tanaav gaharaa saktaa he
 However, Trump also said that we will try to take a diplomatic approach on this issue
 donald trump prashasan ne haal hi main north koreako suraksha ke liye ghaatak desh bataaya tha
 He said that he would try to put pressure on North Korea economically and diplomatically

 Humanity has died, humanity has become ashamed, a family is suffering in the street, a father, a husband, for his wife, for his innocent child, begging the merciless people for an hour and a half
 lekin kareeb pachaas lakh kii aabaadi vaale jaipur shahar main uske paas se hajaaron insaan to gujarey par madad kaa haath kisi ne nahin badhaayaa
 Finally, two people of that family died on seeing stones in front of stony people on the stony road
 tasviren jhooth nahin boltin varanaa shaayad sunne vaale ise bhi sach nahin maanate or dekhne vaale saaf mukar jate
 We all call ourselves human beings, but from among us, only a few such people do that action
 jinhen dekh kar haivaan bhi hamase jalane lage
 Then, whether it is a victim, an accident or a human spectacle, who is silent on seeing the accident
 itani kadavi baaten ham haragij naa kehete
 But what to do when a man between us and your city, while injured himself among the corpses of his wife and milkman, kept on chanting for help and help for his injured innocent son, who was on the road for the whole hour and a half
 If not a single window is opened in the entire city, then what if there is no doubt that you are alive? Actually, this disturbing incident is of the enchanting tunnel of Jaipur
 ek hansata-kheltaa parivaar is tunnel se guzar rahaa tha ki tabhi peeche se aa rahe ek tej raftaar trek ne us motor cycle ko takkar maar di jisapar par ye parivaar savaar tha
 mian-biwi, his ten-month-old daughter and four-year-old son were riding on the bike at the time of the accident
 trek to takkar maar kar bhaag gaya peeche puraa parivaar khun se lathpath sadak par gir padaa
 But even then everyone was breathing
 parivaar kaa mukhiya khud ghayal tha par apane bivi bacchon ko bachaana chahta tha
 Hopefully! The window of help would open in time
 kyonki agar aisa hua hota to insaaniyat yun sharminda naa hoti
 a ten-month-old innocent girl and her mother Yun Sisak-sisak and would not die in the middle of the year
 sisitivi footage ke mutabik parivaar kaa mukhiya ghayal kanhaiya kisi tarah khud ko sambhalata he or ghayal bivi, beti or bete ko samet kar ek saath sadak par hi rakh detaa he
 All four were soaked in blood
 unhen fouran aspataal le jane kii jarurat thi
 Therefore Kanhaiya begs for help from every person passing through the tunnel
 is dauraan tunnel se darjanon gaadiyaan or usamen savaar saikadon insaan guzarate hai
 The speed of some trains is reduced
 par insaanon kii nahin, wo bas dekhte, sochate, apni gaadi ko bachaate or batch kar besharmi ke saath nikal jate
 As if nothing has happened
 vakt lagaataar bitta ja rahaa tha
 The blood was flowing wildly
 saansen har pal dam ghont rahi thi
 During this time, no one knows how many trucks, buses, cars, jeeps, tampos, bikes have passed
 par uchhamen shaayad ek bhi insaan savaar nahin tha
 Because there is no stopping
 alabatta har guzarati gaadi ko chalaane vaala insaan is baat kaa khyaal jarur kar rahaa tha ki bich sadak par ghayal insaanon se unki gaadi naa takaraa jaae
 Therefore, they would reduce the speed and then go through cutting the kanni from those injured
 duusari taraf kanhaiya har aati gaadi ko jindagi kii nazar se dekhtaa
 Despite being soaked in blood, he again gets his courage back with full courage
 unhen aawaaj detaa, unhen pukaarata or jaise hi wo bina ruke guzar jate, wo phir kabhi apane bete, kabhi beti, to kabhi bivi se lipat jaataa
 Weeping, head banging, and then began to look at the next car impatiently that maybe a person might be seen in them
 or is tarah insaanon kii ummid main naa sirf insaaniyat dam todatii gai
 Rather, the ten-month-old innocent of Kanhaiya died on the road and then shortly after, his wife also said goodbye to the stone-pelting city on the stony road
 par kanhaiya ab bhi nahin thakaa tha
 Even now he was crying like crazy, screaming
 gidgidaa rahaa tha, haath jod rahaa tha, ki kam se kam koi uske bete ko to bachaa le
 Finally, after about an hour and a half, the person inside a motorcycle rider woke up
 pehle wo rukaa, phir use dekh kar doosraa ruke, phir teesraa rukaa or tab kahin jaakar kanhaiyaaki insaanon kii khoj khatm hui
 But i wish! If this same person had become a human being some time ago, what would have known Kanhaiya's wife and daughter would have survived

 Some states of the country are facing drought, while some states are receiving heavy rains
 uttar bharat se monsoon yun to abhi duuri banaae hue he
 But torrential rains have been raining in Jharkhand for the past 24 hours
 har saal yahaan takreeban 1200 se 1400 mimi varsha hoti he
 Which is enough for the needs of the state but unfortunately 92% of it is wasted every year

 narendra modi sarkaar ne pichley saal baari janadesh ke saath janata kii jo sweekruti arjeet kii, uske ek hisse ko ganvaa baithne main use sirf 10 maheene lage hai
 There is a need to keep the image of the person embarked on the mission of development and administration, only a few unbridled cannons, and Modi's mysterious silence on the demand to silence them
 video dekhen, 10 maheene baad kya he modi sarkaar kaa haal?party netaa bataate hai ki sampradayik ashishnutaa kii chhavi kaa pusht hona or iske vipareet modi kii vikaas samarthak chhavi kaa mand padana 2014 kii sardiyon se shuru hua tha, jab aresas se jude sanghathanon ne do alag-alag abhiyaan shuru kiye the
 One was against the alleged 'jihad' and the other was for a re-conversion or 'return of home' to Hinduism
 jaisaa vihip ke pitrupurush ashok singhl loksabhaa chunaavon main jeet ke baad se lagaataar kehete aa rahe hai, ''desh main ek bada varg he, jo hamaare khoe hue raaj kii vaapasi ke sapane dekhtaa he
 After Prithviraj Chauhan, Hindutva has got the reins of India (under Modi)
 "video dekhen, 10 maheene baad modi aage bijepi pichheyani tarah-tarah ke sur samay-samay par nikalate rahete hai
 Which on every occasion forces the Opposition to pull Team Modi
 jin par samaaj ke vibhinn virgon se chintaa or gusse se lekar chidh bhari pratikriyaayein aati hai or sarkaar baikfoot par aa jaati he
 See, during the preparations for the by-elections in Uttar Pradesh in September last year, Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath waged a war against 'love Jehad'
 yah baat shant hoti, usase pehle hi sakshi maharaj kii yah tippanee aa gai ki madrason main aatankwaadi taiyaar ho rahe hai or uske baad disambar main rajyamantri sadhvi niranjan jyoti ne 'haramjade' banaam ''ramjade" kaa siddhant diya
 In the same month, Ram Naik, the Governor of Uttar Pradesh and a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, said that the Ram temple in Ayodhya should be built as soon as possible and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj claimed that the Bhagavad Gita should be declared a national holy book
 dilli vidhansabha ke chunaav jaise hi kareeb aae, sardiyon main charchon par hamale or todphod hui, jiskaa nateeja isaayiyon kii bechaini main niklaa
 In spring this year, a national debate erupted over the ban on beef in Haryana and Maharashtra
 is aag main ghi kaa kaam kendriya grih mantri rajnath singh ne yah kahkar kiya ki ''is desh main gohatya kii anumati nahin di ja sakati
 We will apply full force to ban it
 "ek varisht afasarshah kehete hai ki id ke din sarkari kaarykram kaa aayojan karne kaa modi kaa faisla, ramajaan ke dauraan iftaar kaa aayojan karne se mantriyon kii anakani or 25 disambar ko sushasan diwas manaane kaa sarkari farmaan-is sabase is bechaini main ijapha hua ki ek kathith hindu atirashtravaadi sarkaar apni takat dikhaane lagi he
 Very rarely, that too late? a top minister in the Modi cabinet told India Today at the time, "these elements feel that their exuberance will please Nagpur (RSS headquarters), but the truth is that Nagpur is also unhappy with this
 " kai mantri is baat par afsos jataate hai ki aisi belgaum topon ne vipaksh ko janata kaa dhyaan vikaas se dur hataane kaa mauka de diya he
 a senior Union minister says that Modi tried to control these elements
 ve kehete hai, ''aresas ke prachaarak rajeshwar singh ko dharm jaagran (pashchimi uttar pradesh main ghar vaapasi) kaary se hataanaa parade ke peeche kii gai karrwai kaa spasht udhaaharan he
 "but by the time Modi first tried openly to assuage the people of religious minority communities, the opposition was able to surround the government and partially convince a large section of the public that Modi's" good Day "was just a promise
 bijepi ke liye samasya yah he ki uske netaa idhar kuan, udhar khai vaali duvidha ko samajhate hai
 a government official who has also served in the Vajpayee government says, "the problem is that the BJP cannot publicly disassociate itself from the concerns expressed in the deliberations of Sangh leaders 
 bijepi kaa kisi bhi str kaa netaa aresas ke bayanon se sahamat najar aana chahta he
 "it is no surprise then that Modi himself initially hesitated to respond to these marginalized elements
 ek sarkari adhikari kehete hai, ''jab aresas pramukh mohan bhagwat usee samay 'hindu raashtra' par lanbaa bhaashan de rahe hon to pradhanmantri, jo khud aresas prachaarak rah chuke hai, un logon ko saarvajanik rup se jawaab kaise de sakate hai?"haalanki bijepi ke kai netaa or sangh ke prachaarak daawa karte hai kiaresasane apane agenda ko aage badhaane ke pehle jaan-boojhkar modi ko apni sthiti majboot karne ke liye samay dene kaa faisla kiya he
 They say that this fact came to light recently in the All India House of Representatives of RSS in Nagpur
 yah sangh parivaar ke sheersh adhikariyon kii sabase badi baithak thi
 Ram temple, Article 370 and many other controversial issues were not raised here
 ek ore aresas ke sarkarywah bhaiyaji joshi kehete hai ki kai saal baad 'bhartiya darshan' ke liye patibaddh ek team nirnay lene ke centre main he
 On the other hand, the annual report of the RSS presented in the meeting showed an attempt to get the government out of pressure
 salanaa report main ullekh kiya gaya ki 'raashtra' apeksha karata he ki sarkaar janata kii ummiido ko samajhe or uske anusaar kaam kare
 People also understand the limitations of government
 "kai mantri bhi is aam samaj se asahmat hai ki sarkaar hindutvvaadi tatwon kii oonche sur main kii ja rahi bayaanbaji se ub chuki he
 Says Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, "the Prime Minister has firmly declared that he is the Prime Minister of every section of Indian society
" sabhi (virgon) ke kalyaan kii disha main puri patibaddhta he, vah bhi behichak or atoot
 "party spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain also reiterates the same sentiment," Narendra Modi is not a leader of Hindus, but a leader of the whole of India
 ve kisi hindustani ko dharm ke chashme se nahin dekhte
 They have only one slogan: Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas
 " prasad kehete hai, ''haashie par pade tatwon kaa thodaa betuka josh sarkaar yaa party kii vichaardhaara kaa pratinidhitiv nahin karata
 "perhaps on the instructions of the Prime Minister, many senior ministers have been silent for months, so that many lines of dialogue do not come together
" ek varisht sarkari adhikari ke mutabik, mana jaataa he ki modi ne ab unase aagrah kiya he ki ve vivaadaaspad bayanon kaa jawaab turant diya karen
 It is perhaps for this reason that Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari recently took the initiative to publicly heed the sentiments of the Christian community
 to sarkaar or party kaa bhavishya kya he? party kii rashtriya kaaryakarini kii baithak 4 april ko bangaluru main hone ja rahi he

 lekin priyanka ko anya netaaon ke saath baitaakar ye sandesh dena chaha ki priyanka bhi anya mahasachivon kii tarah hi baithak main shaamil hui hai

 krishnam ne kaha, 'desh main do tarah ke bhashtachar hai- commercial or communal
 Kejriwal has raised the issue of commercial corruption but there is also a need to talk about community corruption
 isliye hindustan united movement kaa gathan kiya gaya
 'this is the same Krishnam who filed a case of intimidation last year against RSS leader Indresh Kumar
 tawqir raja or krishnam ne sapa or basapa se bhi apil kii he ki agar kejariwal modi ke khilaaf chunaav ladate hai to us seat par wo apane ummidavaar na utaaren

 bhagwaan krishna kaa janm madhyaraatri main hone ke chalate jahaan sari duniya main unka janmabhishek bhale hi bhadrapada maas ke krishna paksh kii ashtami kii raat main kiya jaataa he kintu vrindavan main teen mandir aise hai, jahaan thakurji kaa abhishek din main hi kiya jaataa he
 It is said that since the child image of Thakurji in Braj is served and worshiped, it is believed that he is like his child, child-gopal
 isliye yadi unhen raatri main sote se jagaakar abhishek kiya jayega to mata yashoda ko aisa karnaa bhala nahin lagegaa
 The principal temple among these three temples, was established in Vrindavan by Gopal Bhatt, disciple of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu
 radharaman laal mandir main thakurji kaa abhishek 1542 isvi main is mandir kii sthapana se hi chali aa rahi parampara ke anusaar din main hi kiya jaataa he
 Acharya Padmanabha Goswami, one of the current Goswamis who has been serving generation after generation, said, 'the consecration of the statue of Thakurji, self-manifested in the form of Shaligram, is milk, ghee, boora, curd, honey, etc
 Panchamrit and more than two dozen herbs - Made with herbs from 9 am to 12 am on Tuesday
 ’ unhone kaha, ‘‘abhishek kii parampara mandir kii seva pustika main varnit shastrokt vidhi ke anusaar hi kii jaati he jisamen kareeb 2100 litre doodh evam anya prabhoot saamagree kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 'two devotees of Lucknow, Shah Kundan Lal and Shah Phundan Lal, who were the exclusive devotees of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, came to Vrindavan first
 radharaman mandir kaa jirnoddhar karaayaa or phir ek alag bhavy mandir banwaaya, jisamen unhone bhi thaa
 Worshiped Thakurji in the name of Radharaman
 haalanki, is mandir ke makraana pathar se bane bejod shilp ke kaaran ise tede khambhon vaala athwa shah bihari mandir bhi kaha jaataa he
 He also built a room in this temple which opens only on the day of Basant Panchami
 mandir sthapakon kii chathi peedi ke vanshaj prashanth shah bataate hai ki is mandir main bhi din main hi thakurji kaa abhishek karne kii parampara he jo puure vidhi-vidhaan ke saath nibhaai jaati he

 The Department of Telecom has asked for GPS in all mobile phones

" isliye sarkaar ne yah tay kiya he ki ise 1 janvari 2018 ke baad bikne vaale sabhi handset main jeepies laga hua ho
 The ICA, representing the mobile companies, has told the government that the companies will use A-GPS technology that can track the location of users on connectivity with the mobile tower
 haalanki dot kaa kahana he ki yah methd sirf mobile tower ke jariye yugers ko loket karata he jo puri tarah se sahi nahin hota
 Pankaj Mohindru, National President of ICA has said that the price of cheap feature phones can be increased by up to 50 percent after installing GPS
 kyonki iske liye unamem behatar hardware dene honge

 In addition to Chawla's four wickets, Ryan Harris took three while Shalabh Srivastava picked up two and Pal Valthati took one wicket
 isse pehle gilcrist kaa tas jitkar ballebaaji kaa faisla team ke liye phydemand sabit hua
 After losing the wicket of opener Valthaty (20 runs) in the fourth over, a world record partnership of 206 runs in 16 overs for the second wicket between Gilchrist and Marsh made Punjab score like a mountain

 In today's age, the relationship has become more complex as life has become social
 soshal media ke isdor main yah ek sin he jo yah bataata he ki aap apane rishte main insikyor he
 If your partner does this too much then you should worry
 aapako jaanakar aashcharya hoga ki agar aapkaa partner seshal media par zyada active hota he to ho saktaa he ki wo insikyor mahasoos karata ho
 According to social scientific research, Facebook, Instagram and other social media sites can be a major indicator
 jo ye bataaye ki aapkaa rishta kitna majboot he
 a study has shown that social media plays an important role in the making and breaking of any relationship
 anusandhan ke mutabik jo log apane rishte ke bare main zyada sochate hai, wo log fasebuk par zyada active rahete hai
 Upload excessive photos
 or jo log zyada asurakshit feel karte hai wo soshal media par apane photose zyada share karte hai
 The reason for this could also be that if you uploaded a photo and more likes and comments came on it, your relation could be in danger
 kyoki aapkaa partner is baar se gelas feel kar saktaa he
 People who feel happier and more secure in their relationship, they try to keep their relationship away from social media
 kyonki aise log sochate hai ki unhen apane rishte ko duniya ko dikhaane kii jarurat nahin he
 Excessive use of social media is considered to be a victim of depression, as those who are victims of this thing try to compare their relationship with others
 wo dikhaate hai ki unka rishta auron se behatar he
 But people who are not insecure live their lives
 unhen kisi or se koi matlab nahin hota he
 They make time for each other
 vastav main aisa bilkul nahin he ki agar aap main se koi ek zyada samay soshal media par bitaata he to aapkaa rishta tut saktaa he yaa aap ek-duusare se pyaar nahin karte
 But it uses social media more, it can be insured

 paris main chal rahe jalwaayu parivartan sammelan main samjhaute kaa jo taaja draft taiyaar kiya gaya he, usamen bharat kii us maang ko jagah milti dikh rahi he, jisamen viksit deshon se thodi saral or saadi jeevanstyli apnaane kii apil kii gai thi
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned this in his speech on 30 November at the Paris Climate Change Conference
 viksit deshon kii vilasitapurna jeevanstyli kii vajah se bijli kii kai guna khapat ho rahi he or uski vajah se paryaavaran main carbon utsarjan bad rahaa he
 The new draft of the agreement, which was drafted on Thursday night here in Paris, reads on the sixteenth page that all countries will try a sustainable life style (at least a luxury life), under which consumption of goods consumed And their production will be reduced
 vahiin viksit desh iske liye sabase pehle kadam uthaaenge
 In fact, people in developed countries use electronic and electric appliances indiscriminately for every day work, which is not good for the environment, because it consumes a lot of electricity
 vikasshil deshon kii maang rahi he ki america jaise desh vilasita kam karen, kaaron kaa istemaal ghataaen or bijli or pani kii prati vyakti khapat kam karen
 The comments ection aid ke antarrashtriya policy manager harjit singh kaa kahana he ki har america nijee zaruuraton ke liye ek bhartiya ke mukaable 34 guna zyada bijli kii khapat karata he
 At the Climate Change Summit held in Lima last year, these things were not said so clearly about the lifestyle that is being said now
 or ab agar samjhaute main ye baat kahi gai hai to ye acha sanket he
 It would be good that all countries should not do this and do not differentiate between words
 udyogon or vaahanon se ho rahe pradooshan kii vajah se carbon kaa str khatarnaak str tak bad gaya he or dharti kaa taapmaana bad rahaa he
 To stop this, this struggle is going on in Paris
 mahatvapurn he ki pradhanmantri modi ne jahaan pashchimi deshon ko rahan-sahan ko lekar salaah di he, vahiin bharat main bhi shahari aabaadi is par amal karnaa shuru kare, kyonki shaharon ko saaf rakhane ke liye kaaron kaa istemaal or bijli kii khapat main roak nahin lagi to jeena mushkil ho jayega
 Its concern in Delhi is clearly visible
 yahaan paris main guuruuvaar raat ko samjhaute kaa jo nayaa masauda taiyaar kiya gaya he, usamen solahaven panne par is baat ko likhaa gaya he ki sabhi desh sastenbal life style ( kam se kam vilasitapurna jivan) kii koshish karenge, jiske tahat upbhog kii chizon kii khapat or unka utpaadan kam kiya jayega
 At the same time, developed countries will take the first steps for this
 vastav main viksit deshon main log rosemara ke har kaam ke liye electronic or electric upkarnon kaa andhadhundh istemaal karte hai, jo paryaavaran ke liye acha nahin he, kyonki isamen bijli kii kaaphi khapat hoti he
 Developing countries have been demanding that countries like America reduce luxuries, reduce the use of cars and reduce per capita consumption of electricity and water
 tippaniyan Action Aid's international policy manager Harjeet Singh says that every American consumes 34 times more electricity than an Indian for personal needs
 lima main pichley saal hui clamet change summit main jeevanstyli ko lekar ye baaten itane saaf tareeke se nahin kahi gayi jo ab kahi ja rahi hai
 And now if this is said in the agreement, then it is a good sign
 acha hoga ki is par sabhi desh kerani or kathani main antar na karen
 Due to pollution from industries and vehicles, the carbon level has increased to dangerous levels and the temperature of the earth is increasing
 ise rokane ke liye hi paris main ye jaddojahad chal rahi he
 It is important that while Prime Minister Modi has given advice to western countries on living, in India also the urban population should start implementing it, because the use of cars and consumption of electricity to keep cities clean did not stop
 So it will be difficult to live
 dilli main isaki chintaa saaf dikh rahi he
 In fact, people in developed countries use electronic and electric appliances indiscriminately for every day work, which is not good for the environment, because it consumes a lot of electricity
 vikasshil deshon kii maang rahi he ki america jaise desh vilasita kam karen, kaaron kaa istemaal ghataaen or bijli or pani kii prati vyakti khapat kam karen
 The comments ection aid ke antarrashtriya policy manager harjit singh kaa kahana he ki har america nijee zaruuraton ke liye ek bhartiya ke mukaable 34 guna zyada bijli kii khapat karata he
