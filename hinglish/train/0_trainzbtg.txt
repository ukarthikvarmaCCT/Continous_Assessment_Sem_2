 Despite the efforts of the Pakistan Cricket Board, adamant for not playing a cricket series, India has been attacked by the Pakistan Cricket Board chief Shaharyar Khan in a tone
 shehryaar khan ne kaha he ki pakistan cricket pichley kuch saalon main bharat ke saath nahin khilne ke baavjood khatm nahin hua he or agar bisisiai disambar main yuai main hone vaali prastaavit siries se hat bhi jaataa he to bhi vah khatm nahin hoga
 The PCB and the BCCI have signed a memorandum of understanding between India and Pakistan for six series played between 2015 and 2023
 pisibiko haalanki ab tak pichley hafte bheje patr parabhartiya bordca jawaab nahin mila he jisamen usne bisisiai ko is ‘baadhkaari qaraar’ kaa sammaan karne ko kaha he
 When asked if he saw any possibility of both the rival teams landing on the cricket team in December, Shaharyar said, "it depends on your government
" aapke board ne hamaare saath qaraar kiya he ki ham disambar main khelenge
 He said that we have to get approval from the government
 hamane bisisiai ko likhakar qaraar kaa sammaan karne ko kaha
 We are not running after them
 ham sirf itnaa kah rahe hai ki aapane kisi cheez par hastakshar kiye he isliye kripaya karke apane hastakshar kaa sammaan kiijie
 The PCB has faced numerous criticisms indigenously for repeatedly urging the BCCI to resume bilateral relations
 mahaan ballebaaj javed miyandad ne to yahaan tak kaha ki pisibi ko atmasamman kii keemat par bharat se nahin khelnaa chahie
 With India in the hands of the series, Shaharyar reiterated that politics and sports should not be kept together
 unhone saath hi spasht kiya ki is bahu pratikshit siries kaa bhavishya chaahe kuch bhi ho lekin pakistan cricket khatm nahin hoga
 He said, 'suppose the Indian government decides against playing with Pakistan for political reasons, it does not mean that we will go bankrupt
 ham khatm nahin honge
 Yes, it would be a shock but it is like that
 ’ateet kii tarah is baar bhi is siries kaa bhavishya bharat sarkaar ke haath main he lekin bisisiai sachiv or bhartiya janata party ke saansad anuraag thakur ke haalia twit ko dhyaan main rakhen to donon deshon ke prashansakon ko siries ko lekar adhik ummid nahin bandhati
 Asked about Thakur's last month's tweet, Shaharyar said, "we have nothing to do with Dawood Ibrahim
 hamaari sarkaar baar baar spasht kar chuki he ki vah pakistan main nahin he
 This is part of the political ups and downs
 cricket ek tarika he jiske jariye ham behatar rishte bana sakate hai
 'earlier Thakur tweeted,' Dawood is in Karachi
 enese yahaan algaavvaadiyon se milanaa chahta he
 Are you really serious about peace and you expect us to play cricket with you? ”to clarify the attitude, the Government of India said that there can be no time limit on indo-pak cricket matters as most decisions are taken in the last moments
 Huh
 unhone haalanki bisisiai or bharat sarkaar se sakaaratmak pratikriya kii ummid jataai
 He said, 'pakistan government is in favor of cricketing relations with India
 samay aa gaya he ki bharat sarkaar apana ravaiya spasht kare
 'shaharyar said,' Politics and cricket should be kept separate
 bharat-pakistan rishton main hameshaa utaar chadhaav aate hai
 We also played on your land in 1999, when the situation was tense, we got tremendous support from people wherever we went
 ’unhone kaha, ‘iske baad lambey samay baad aap 2004 main hamaare yahaan aae
 i wrote to Jagmohan Dalmiya that then (in 2004) you made it possible, you can still do it
 yahaan tak ki cricket se donon deshon ke bich rishton main sudhaar hua tha

 ramdev ne kaha he ki agar ham chini saamaanon kaa bahishkaar kar den to china ko bharat ke saamne jhukna hoga or naak ragadne par majaboor hona hoga
 He claims that if this happens, China will definitely step back
 yogaguru ne kaha ki china apane inhen saamaanon ko bharat main bech kar unase hue laabh se vah pakistan ke aatankwaad ko badhaava de rahaa he, jisase aae din pakistani aatankwaadi bharat kii seemaa par ghuspaith kar hamaare sainikon ko nuksaan pahuchane kaa kaam kar rahe hai
 Yogguru said that first of all we have to connect Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok) with India while giving a befitting reply to Pakistan

 Finance Minister p Chidambaram on Wednesday said that the measures taken by the Reserve Bank in the case of investment by Indian companies abroad "should not be considered as control over capital" and the central bank will review it again in time
 'chidambaram ne bataaya, 'rigerv bank ke paripatr (videshon main kiye jane vaale pratyaksh nivesh ke bare main) ko gharelu companiyon par puunji niyantran ke taur par nahin dekhnaa chahie

 ! My name is Arunima Sinha
 mujhe log sonu bhi kehete hai
 i am not very famous but the incident that happened to me two years ago gave me recognition
 vah pahchaan koi nekanami vaali nahin thi or na hi maine koi acha kaam kiya tha
 She was slanderous
 magar meri kya galati thi? i belong to the Kshetrana (shajadpur) locality of Ambedkarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh
 sach to yah he ki ham log mulat: bihar ke hai
 Father was in the army and we had come to Sultanpur
 lekin jab main chaar saal kii thi, tabhi mere pitaaji kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 i have a younger brother and older sister Lakshmi
 aap samaj sakate hai ki bina pita ke parivaar kii kya haalat hoti he
 My mother came to Ambedkaranagar and got a job in the health department
 kisi tarah jivan kii gaadi aage badhane lagi
 i too was sent to school to study but i used to feel more like playing
 hamaare samaaj main ladakiyon ko ghar ke kaam main nipun karne kii parampara he, khilne vaali ladkiyaan kam hi dikhaai padati hai
 People also refused but where was i going to believe
 meri maa bhi mujhe nahin tokati thi or meri maa jaisi didi lakshmi to jaise mere peeche diwaar banakar khadi rahati thim
 i played football, volleyball and hockey
 hockey khilne ke liye stick lekar jab nikalati thi to mohalle ke ladke kahaan baj aane vaale
 They used to ridicule me
 kehete the, dekho ja rahi he jhaansi kii rani banakar khilne, badi ai stick lekar chalane vaali
 Although i did not even care for the boys, but when i looked at the news, i used to stare and look at them, then they would fly away
 mujhe yaad he ki ek baar jab main 14 baras kii rahi houngi or cycle se ham donon bahanen kahin ja rahe the to ek jagah par lakshmi didi rukkar kisi se baat karne lageen or main thodaa aage nikalakar vahaan par unka intjaar karne lagi
 During that time some boys passed through the bicycle and asked me to leave the way
 maine manaa kar diya or kaha ki aage jagah he, udhar se nikal jaao
 He was adamant and i kept on my point
 is bich jab lakshmi didi aa gayi or ham chalane lage to kisi ladke ne jhapad maaraa jo meri didi ke gaal par lag gaya
 Taking advantage of the crowd, the boys ran away
 didi ke gaal par chaanta dekhakar mujhe bahut krodh aayaa
 i told Didi that let's find the boy and teach him a lesson
 didi ne manaa kiya lekin mere upar to jaise chandi savaar thi
 Both of us kept searching for those boys for a long time and wandered and came to the same place
 vahaan par paan kii dukaan par khadey ek ladke kii shart kaa kaaler dekhakar didi ne kaha ki yahi vah ladkaa he
 What was it again, i ran over and grabbed the boy and said to Didi, "mara didi, don't leave
 " There was a crowd, quite a ruckus but i did not leave
 ant main us ladke ke ghar vaale aae or maafee maangi tab jaakar maine use choda
 After that, no one looked at me or towards my sister
 lakshmi didi kii shaadi ho gai lekin mere prati unka itnaa pyaar rahata he ki vah sasuraal se zyada maayke main hi rahati hai or meri or meri maa-bhai kii madad karne ke liye hameshaa jaan die rahati hai
 My brother-in-law Om Prakash ji is like a god to us

 maine inter kiya, elelbi kiya lekin khelnaa mere liye junun ke samaan hi tha
 i played volleyball-football in the surrounding districts, won many awards, but my passion kept growing
 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe
 maine sochaa ki kahin par naukari kar luun taaki usee ke saath aage badhati jaaun
 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli
 The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum
 i have not even passed Inter
 main kisi ke saath bhaag rahi thi
 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail eke jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati
 i angrily telephoned AK Jain and told him that were any of your soldiers present in the train who would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day? Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i should go to AK Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made my problem easy by the US resident Dr
 Rakesh Srivastava and his brother Shailesh Srivastava who run an organization called Innovative
 unhone mere liye ek kritrim pair banwaaya jisko pahanakar main chalati hum
 Ajay Maken gave me so much convenience and that too when the government of Uttar Pradesh took off to tell me the culprit and the media followed me
 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me
 
 ! " "main safalataa ke aasmaan par hum, everest ke upar hum
 i have got what i have wished for
 mere pairon ne bhi meraa puraa saath diya
 What happened is i don't have my own left leg
 
 The paralyzed feet did not even allow the feeling of defeatism
 
 What a foot, i would have been here even if i had nothing else
 oonchai hi mujhe pukaarti he, mere buland iraadon ko koi chhu bhi nahin saktaa, mujhe koi roak bhi nahin saktaa
 i wanted to play volleyball-football, wanted to be a hockey champion, but my cut leg prevented me from going to rules tied to the law
 log kehete hai ki kanoon pairon main bandhi hui bediyon ke samaan hote hai, mere paas to ek pair bhi nahin tha, lekin parvat par chadhane se mujhe koun roak saktaa tha
 When i first expressed my heartfelt desire to conquer Everest, what a joke people had made
 aaj ve hi log dekh len ki main kahaan par hum
 
 are, pairon se chalakar manzil milti hoti to arabon log apni manjilon par pahunch gaye hote, yah to hausala hota he jo aapako kahin bhi panhucha detaa he
 Like i am here today under white snow covered hills and clear blue sky, Jai Bajrangbali
 
 ! naam meraa he arunima sinha
 i am also called Sonu
 main bahut prasiddh nahin hum lekin do saal pehle mere saath jo haadasa hua tha, usase mujhe pahchaan mili
 That identity was not of any good faith nor did i do any good
 vah badanaami thi
 But what was my fault? main uttar pradesh ke ambedkarnagar jile ke kshetrana (shajadpur) mohalle kii hum
 The truth is that we are originally from Bihar
 pita fouj main the or ham log sultanpur aa gaye the
 But when i was four years old, my father died
 meraa ek chota bhai he or badi bahan lakshmi
 You can understand what is the condition of a family without a father
 meri maa ambedkarnagar aa gayi or swasthya vibhaag main unhen naukari mil gai
 Somehow the train of life started moving forward
 mujhe bhi padhai ke liye skool bheja gaya lekin meraa khilne main zyada man lagata tha
 In our society, girls have a tradition of mastering household chores, girls playing are rarely seen
 logon ne manaa bhi kiya lekin main kahaan maanane vaali thi
 My mother also did not interrupt me and didi Lakshmi like my mother used to stand behind me like a wall
 maine footbal, wollyboul or hockey kheli
 When the boy came out with a stick to play hockey, where are the boys from the neighborhood
 ve meri khilli udaate the
 They used to say, look, you are going to play as a queen of Jhansi, carrying a big eye stick
 main vaise to ladakon kii parvaah bhi nahin karti thi, lekin jab baat akharane vaali lagati thi to main ghurkar unki taraf dekhati thi, to ve udan-chhu ho jate the
 i remember that once i would be 14 years old and both our sisters were going somewhere by bicycle, then Lakshmi didi stopped at one place and started talking to someone and i went ahead and waited for her there
 us dauraan kuch ladke cycle se udhar se gujarey to mujhase rasta chhodane ko kaha
 i refused and said that there is a place ahead, get out of there
 ve apni baat par ade rahe or main apni baat par
 Meanwhile, when Lakshmi didi came and we started walking, a boy slapped me, which hit my sister's cheek
 bheed kaa laabh uthaakar ladke bhaag gaye
 i was very angry to see the sister on the cheek
 maine didi se kaha ki chalo us ladke ko dhundhakar sabak sikhaate hai
 Sister refused but Chandi was riding on me
 ham donon un ladakon ko kaaphi der tak talashte rahe or gum-phir kar usee jagah aa gaye
 Seeing the collar of a boy's shirt standing at the paan shop there, Didi said that this is the boy
 bas phir kya tha, maine daudkar us ladke ko daboch liya or didi se kaha, "maar didi, chhodana nahin
 " bheed lag gai, kaaphi bavaal hua lekin maine choda nahin
 Finally, the boy's housemates came and apologized and then i left him
 uske baad phir kisi ne meri taraf yaa meri didi kii taraf najar uthaakar bhi nahin dekha
 Laxmi Didi got married but she has so much love towards me that she lives in the maternal house more than her in-laws and always lives to help me and my mother-brother
 mere jija om prakaash ji bhi hamaare liye devtaa kii tarah hai
 Bajrangbali made them just like us
 unheen kii chhatrachhaaya ne mujhe meraa sapana puraa karne main madad kii he
 i did inter, LLB but playing was the same as passion for me
 maine aas-paas ke jilon main wollyboul-footbal khelaa, kai puraskaar jite, lekin meraa junun badhata hi gaya
 i also participated in sports at the national level but i did not get my rights
 mere paas haath-pair the, junun tha lekin koi seedhi nahin thi, koi chat nahin thi jo mujhe aage badhane detii, mujhe mahfuj rakhti
 i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that
 kai jagah farm daale
 Also tried in CISF and one day got out of the house to go to Noida's CISF office, alone
 vah din tha 11 april 2011 kaa
 i did not know that my world was going to change
 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa
 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali
 
 yah kya ho rahaa he meri jindagi ke saath
 
 or ab kya shesh rah gaya he hone ko? ankhon ke saamne kabhi maa kii tasviir aati to kabhi bhai to kabhi lakshmi didi kii to kabhi jija kii
 
 
 i found myself lying when the people came towards the railway tracks for toilet
 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital
 subah ke saat baje ke kareeb mujhe aspataal panhuchaya gaya
 My left leg was cut off
 media dwaara shor machaane par mujhe lakhanu ke troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 From there i was again taken to AIIMS
 doctoron ne mujhe bachaa liya
 CISF announced the hiring
 tatkaaleen rail mantri mamata banerjee ne bhi naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken gave considerable relief
 samaaj ko ye baaten hajam nahin huin
 With treatment, controversy also started that i am not a national level player
 maine inter bhi paas nahin kiya he
 i was running away with someone
 meri shaadi ho chuki he
 i did not participate in any competition
 main juthi hum, farebi hum
 UP ADG Rail AK Jain has proved me a liar by doing a press conference and said that i had attempted suicide by jumping from the train or i was crossing the railway line at midnight alone in that rugged desert area when this accident Decreased
 maine gusse main eke jain ko phone lagaakar khub sunaaya ki kya aapkaa koi sipaahi train main maujuud tha jo bataata ki us din train main mujhe luutane kii koshish nahin kii gai thi? kya raatbhar patariyon par pade hone ke baavjood jiarapy ne meri koi madad kii? man karata tha ki main eke jain ke paas jaakar unka munh noch luun
 My mother, my sister and brother-in-law at AIIMS explained to me what else does not happen to girls, people add acid, you have only got one leg, now plan ahead
 bahan kii prerana ne mere man main yah baat laa di ki kuch aisa karun jise duniya dekhe
 Why don't i climb Everest? i thought the best idea was to climb Everest without a foot
 asli chunauti yahi he
 Everyone does an easy job
 meri mushkil ko aasaan kar diya america nivasee dow rakesh shrivastav or unke bhai shailesh shrivastav ne jo innovative naam se ek sanstha chalaate hai
 They made a prosthetic leg for me which i wear
 mujhe ajay maakan ne itani sahuliyatein deen or vah bhi tab, jab uttar pradesh kii sarkaar mujhe mulgim bataane ke liye utaaru thi or media mere peeche pad gaya tha
 Players' organization 'sai' did not even consider me as a player
 main cheekh-cheekh kar kaha karti thi ki "main jinda hum, mujhase aakar pucho, main juthi nahin hum
 " lekin museebaton or parikshaon kaa ant abhi nahin hua tha
 My infamy was following me when i returned after spending four months in AIIMS
 mujhe viklaangata kaa pramaan patr mil gaya tha or rail se paas bhi
 But i did not get a ticket to run in the reserved coach of the second class of the train
 mujhe daudaya jaataa, shaq kiya jaataa
 For me, walking in a disabled bogey was like drinking bitter sips of insult
 arpeef ke sipaahi meri taang khulwakar dekhte or phir paas mangakar uski jaanch karte
 Once in Haridwar, the station master helped me a lot when i did not get a ticket
 unhone counter clerk se tikat dene ko kaha lekin usne kaha ki use mere paas par use shaq he
 It does not contain signatures
 ant main stesan master ne apane dam par mujhe jabardastee train main baithaaya
 Mamta Banerjee had announced the job
 jab main kritrim taangon se chalakar rail mantralay panhuchi to unke pie ne milaane se manaa kar diya
 Disappointed thrice, i returned
 railway board ke adhyaksh vivek sahay se milane main main kisi tarah kaamyaab ho gai to unka jawaab sunakar hairat hui
 He looked at all the papers and then said that first get a good report from the GRP
 ye thi railway ke mantri or adhyaksh kii maanviyata
 i did not lose courage
 kaha ki in sabko apni takat dikhaaungi, ye sab mujhe pahachaanenge or khud chalakar mere paas aaenge
 Bachendri Pal encouraged me a lot
 unheen ke prashikshan kii badaulat main aaj aasmaan ke itane kareeb hum
 i am on the peak of Mount Everest where not everyone can reach
 aisa lagata he ki bas haath uthaaun or chhu luun
 The comments mujhe bukhaar aa gaya
 And i had to return down to the world that did not want me to reach here
 lekin kuch log the jinka mere par vishwaas tha or unheen ke bharose main yahaan tak pahunchi hum
 My desire is to help people like myself with disabilities whom the society rejects
 main chaahati hum ki unke liye koi khel academy banaaun, unnav main saadhe saat bigha jameen mil gai he
 Have to buy three and a half bighas
 is academy se jab meri jaisi oonchi chahat rakhane vaale niklenge tab mujhe lagegaa ki mere saath jo kuch hua vah sab thik tha kyonki agar ye sab na hota to aane vaali peedi ko hausala koun de paata
 
 ! agle maheene kii 10 taarikh ko main 27 varsh kii ho jaaoongi
 i still have the courage to touch many heights
 bas, mujhe koi chunauti de dijie

 mujhe daudaya jaataa, shaq kiya jaataa
 For me, walking in a disabled bogey was like drinking bitter sips of insult
 arpeef ke sipaahi meri taang khulwakar dekhte or phir paas mangakar uski jaanch karte
 Once in Haridwar, the station master helped me a lot when i did not get a ticket
 unhone counter clerk se tikat dene ko kaha lekin usne kaha ki use mere paas par use shaq he
 It does not contain signatures
 ant main stesan master ne apane dam par mujhe jabardastee train main baithaaya
 Mamta Banerjee had announced the job
 jab main kritrim taangon se chalakar rail mantralay panhuchi to unke pie ne milaane se manaa kar diya
 Disappointed thrice, i returned
 railway board ke adhyaksh vivek sahay se milane main main kisi tarah kaamyaab ho gai to unka jawaab sunakar hairat hui
 He looked at all the papers and then said that first get a good report from the GRP
 ye thi railway ke mantri or adhyaksh kii maanviyata
 i did not lose courage
 kaha ki in sabko apni takat dikhaaungi, ye sab mujhe pahachaanenge or khud chalakar mere paas aaenge
 Bachendri Pal encouraged me a lot
 unheen ke prashikshan kii badaulat main aaj aasmaan ke itane kareeb hum
 i am on the peak of Mount Everest where not everyone can reach
 aisa lagata he ki bas haath uthaaun or chhu luun
 The comments mujhe bukhaar aa gaya
 And i had to return down to the world that did not want me to reach here
 lekin kuch log the jinka mere par vishwaas tha or unheen ke bharose main yahaan tak pahunchi hum
 My desire is to help people like myself with disabilities whom the society rejects
 main chaahati hum ki unke liye koi khel academy banaaun, unnav main saadhe saat bigha jameen mil gai he
 Have to buy three and a half bighas
 is academy se jab meri jaisi oonchi chahat rakhane vaale niklenge tab mujhe lagegaa ki mere saath jo kuch hua vah sab thik tha kyonki agar ye sab na hota to aane vaali peedi ko hausala koun de paata
 
 ! agle maheene kii 10 taarikh ko main 27 varsh kii ho jaaoongi
 i still have the courage to touch many heights
 bas, mujhe koi chunauti de dijie
 
 !" When i first expressed my heartfelt desire to conquer Everest, what a joke people had made
 aaj ve hi log dekh len ki main kahaan par hum
 
 are, pairon se chalakar manzil milti hoti to arabon log apni manjilon par pahunch gaye hote, yah to hausala hota he jo aapako kahin bhi panhucha detaa he
 Like i am here today under white snow covered hills and clear blue sky, Jai Bajrangbali
 
 ! naam meraa he arunima sinha
 i am also called Sonu
 main bahut prasiddh nahin hum lekin do saal pehle mere saath jo haadasa hua tha, usase mujhe pahchaan mili
 That identity was not of any good faith nor did i do any good
 vah badanaami thi
 But what was my fault? main uttar pradesh ke ambedkarnagar jile ke kshetrana (shajadpur) mohalle kii hum
 The truth is that we are originally from Bihar
 pita fouj main the or ham log sultanpur aa gaye the
 But when i was four years old, my father died
 meraa ek chota bhai he or badi bahan lakshmi
 You can understand what is the condition of a family without a father
 meri maa ambedkarnagar aa gayi or swasthya vibhaag main unhen naukari mil gai
 Somehow the train of life started moving forward
 mujhe bhi padhai ke liye skool bheja gaya lekin meraa khilne main zyada man lagata tha
 In our society, girls have a tradition of mastering household chores, girls playing are rarely seen
 logon ne manaa bhi kiya lekin main kahaan maanane vaali thi
 me and didi Lakshmi like my mother used to stand behind me like a wall
 maine footbal, wollyboul or hockey kheli
 When the boy came out with a stick to play hockey, where are the boys from the neighborhood
 ve meri khilli udaate the
 They used to say, look, you are going to play as a queen of Jhansi, carrying a big eye stick
 main vaise to ladakon kii parvaah bhi nahin karti thi, lekin jab baat akharane vaali lagati thi to main ghurkar unki taraf dekhati thi, to ve udan-chhu ho jate the
 i remember that once i would be 14 years old and both our sisters were going somewhere by bicycle, then Lakshmi didi stopped at one place and started talking to someone and i went ahead and waited for her there
 us dauraan kuch ladke cycle se udhar se gujarey to mujhase rasta chhodane ko kaha
 i refused and said that there is a place ahead, get out of there
 ve apni baat par ade rahe or main apni baat par
 Meanwhile, when Lakshmi didi came and we started walking, a boy slapped me, which hit my sister's cheek
 bheed kaa laabh uthaakar ladke bhaag gaye
 i was very angry to see the sister on the cheek
 maine didi se kaha ki chalo us ladke ko dhundhakar sabak sikhaate hai
 Sister refused but Chandi was riding on me
 ham donon un ladakon ko kaaphi der tak talashte rahe or gum-phir kar usee jagah aa gaye
 Seeing the collar of a boy's shirt standing at the paan shop there, Didi said that this is the boy
 bas phir kya tha, maine daudkar us ladke ko daboch liya or didi se kaha, "maar didi, chhodana nahin
 " bheed lag gai, kaaphi bavaal hua lekin maine choda nahin
 Finally, the boy's housemates came and apologized and then i left him
 uske baad phir kisi ne meri taraf yaa meri didi kii taraf najar uthaakar bhi nahin dekha
 Laxmi Didi got married but she has so much love towards me that she lives in the maternal house more than her in-laws and always lives to help me and my mother-brother
 mere jija om prakaash ji bhi hamaare liye devtaa kii tarah hai
 Bajrangbali made them just like us
 unheen kii chhatrachhaaya ne mujhe meraa sapana puraa karne main madad kii he
 i did inter, LLB but playing was the same as passion for me
 maine aas-paas ke jilon main wollyboul-footbal khelaa, kai puraskaar jite, lekin meraa junun badhata hi gaya
 i also participated in sports at the national level but i did not get my rights
 mere paas haath-pair the, junun tha lekin koi seedhi nahin thi, koi chat nahin thi jo mujhe aage badhane detii, mujhe mahfuj rakhti
 i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that
 kai jagah farm daale
 Also tried in CISF and one day got out of the house to go to Noida's CISF office, alone
 vah din tha 11 april 2011 kaa
 i did not know that my world was going to change
 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa
 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali
 
 yah kya ho rahaa he meri jindagi ke saath
 
 or ab kya shesh rah gaya he hone ko? ankhon ke saamne kabhi maa kii tasviir aati to kabhi bhai to kabhi lakshmi didi kii to kabhi jija kii
 
 
 i found myself lying when the people came towards the railway tracks for toilet
 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital
 subah ke saat baje ke kareeb mujhe aspataal panhuchaya gaya
 My left leg was cut off
 media dwaara shor machaane par mujhe lakhanu ke troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 From there i was again taken to AIIMS
 doctoron ne mujhe bachaa liya
 CISF announced the hiring
 tatkaaleen rail mantri mamata banerjee ne bhi naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken gave considerable relief
 samaaj ko ye baaten hajam nahin huin
 With treatment, controversy also started that i am not a national level player
 maine inter bhi paas nahin kiya he
 i was running away with someone
 meri shaadi ho chuki he
 i did not participate in any competition
 main juthi hum, farebi hum
 UP ADG Rail AK Jain has proved me a liar by doing a press conference and said that i had attempted suicide by jumping from the train or i was crossing the railway line at midnight alone in that rugged desert area when this accident Decreased
 maine gusse main eke jain ko phone lagaakar khub sunaaya ki kya aapkaa koi sipaahi train main maujuud tha jo bataata ki us din train main mujhe luutane kii koshish nahin kii gai thi? kya raatbhar patariyon par pade hone ke baavjood jiarapy ne meri koi madad kii? man karata tha ki main eke jain ke paas jaakar unka munh noch luun
 My mother, my sister and brother-in-law at AIIMS explained to me what else does not happen to girls, people add acid, you have only got one leg, now plan ahead
 bahan kii prerana ne mere man main yah baat laa di ki kuch aisa karun jise duniya dekhe
 Why don't i climb Everest? i thought the best idea was to climb Everest without a foot
 asli chunauti yahi he
 Everyone does an easy job
 meri mushkil ko aasaan kar diya america nivasee dow rakesh shrivastav or unke bhai shailesh shrivastav ne jo innovative naam se ek sanstha chalaate hai
 They made a prosthetic leg for me which i wear
 mujhe ajay maakan ne itani sahuliyatein deen or vah bhi tab, jab uttar pradesh kii sarkaar mujhe mulgim bataane ke liye utaaru thi or media mere peeche pad gaya tha
 Players' organization 'sai' did not even consider me as a player
 main cheekh-cheekh kar kaha karti thi ki "main jinda hum, mujhase aakar pucho, main juthi nahin hum
 " lekin museebaton or parikshaon kaa ant abhi nahin hua tha
 My infamy was following me when i returned after spending four months in AIIMS
 mujhe viklaangata kaa pramaan patr mil gaya tha or rail se paas bhi
 But i did not get a ticket to run in the reserved coach of the second class of the train
 mujhe daudaya jaataa, shaq kiya jaataa
 For me, walking in a disabled bogey was like drinking bitter sips of insult
 arpeef ke sipaahi meri taang khulwakar dekhte or phir paas mangakar uski jaanch karte
 Once in Haridwar, the station master helped me a lot when i did not get a ticket

 bas, mujhe koi chunauti de dijie
 
 !" My name is Arunima Sinha
 mujhe log sonu bhi kehete hai
 i am not very famous but the incident that happened to me two years ago gave me recognition
 vah pahchaan koi nekanami vaali nahin thi or na hi maine koi acha kaam kiya tha
 She was slanderous
 magar meri kya galati thi? i belong to the Kshetrana (shajadpur) locality of Ambedkarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh
 sach to yah he ki ham log mulat: bihar ke hai
 Father was in the army and we had come to Sultanpur
 lekin jab main chaar saal kii thi, tabhi mere pitaaji kaa swargvaas ho gaya
 i have a younger brother and older sister Lakshmi
 aap samaj sakate hai ki bina pita ke parivaar kii kya haalat hoti he
 My mother came to Ambedkaranagar and got a job in the health department
 kisi tarah jivan kii gaadi aage badhane lagi
 i too was sent to school to study but i used to feel more like playing
 hamaare samaaj main ladakiyon ko ghar ke kaam main nipun karne kii parampara he, khilne vaali ladkiyaan kam hi dikhaai padati hai
 People also refused but where was i going to believe
 meri maa bhi mujhe nahin tokati thi or meri maa jaisi didi lakshmi to jaise mere peeche diwaar banakar khadi rahati thim
 i played football, volleyball and hockey
 hockey khilne ke liye stick lekar jab nikalati thi to mohalle ke ladke kahaan baj aane vaale
 They used to ridicule me
 kehete the, dekho ja rahi he jhaansi kii rani banakar khilne, badi ai stick lekar chalane vaali
 Although i did not even care for the boys, but when i looked at the news, i used to stare and look at them, then they would fly away
 mujhe yaad he ki ek baar jab main 14 baras kii rahi houngi or cycle se ham donon bahanen kahin ja rahe the to ek jagah par lakshmi didi rukkar kisi se baat karne lageen or main thodaa aage nikalakar vahaan par unka intjaar karne lagi
 During that time some boys passed through the bicycle and asked me to leave the way
 maine manaa kar diya or kaha ki aage jagah he, udhar se nikal jaao
 He was adamant and i kept on my point
 is bich jab lakshmi didi aa gayi or ham chalane lage to kisi ladke ne jhapad maaraa jo meri didi ke gaal par lag gaya
 Taking advantage of the crowd, the boys ran away
 didi ke gaal par chaanta dekhakar mujhe bahut krodh aayaa
 i told Didi that let's find the boy and teach him a lesson
 didi ne manaa kiya lekin mere upar to jaise chandi savaar thi
 Both of us kept searching for those boys for a long time and wandered and came to the same place
 vahaan par paan kii dukaan par khadey ek ladke kii shart kaa kaaler dekhakar didi ne kaha ki yahi vah ladkaa he
 What was it again, i ran over and grabbed the boy and said to Didi, "mara didi, don't leave
 " There was a crowd, quite a ruckus but i did not leave
 ant main us ladke ke ghar vaale aae or maafee maangi tab jaakar maine use choda
 After that, no one looked at me or towards my sister
 lakshmi didi kii shaadi ho gai lekin mere prati unka itnaa pyaar rahata he ki vah sasuraal se zyada maayke main hi rahati hai or meri or meri maa-bhai kii madad karne ke liye hameshaa jaan die rahati hai
 My brother-in-law Om Prakash ji is like a god to us
 bajrangbali ne unhen jaise hamaare liye hi banaaya tha
 His shadow has helped me fulfill my dream
 maine inter kiya, elelbi kiya lekin khelnaa mere liye junun ke samaan hi tha
 i played volleyball-football in the surrounding districts, won many awards, but my passion kept growing
 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe
 maine sochaa ki kahin par naukari kar luun taaki usee ke saath aage badhati jaaun
 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli
 The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum
 i have not even passed Inter
 main kisi ke saath bhaag rahi thi
 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail eke jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati
 i angrily telephoned AK Jain and told him that were any of your soldiers present in the train who would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day? Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i should go to AK Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made my problem easy by the US resident Dr
 Rakesh Srivastava and his brother Shailesh Srivastava who run an organization called Innovative
 unhone mere liye ek kritrim pair banwaaya jisko pahanakar main chalati hum
 Ajay Maken gave me so much convenience and that too when the government of Uttar Pradesh took off to tell me the culprit and the media followed me
 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me

 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard

 !" My mother came to Ambedkaranagar and got a job in the health department
 kisi tarah jivan kii gaadi aage badhane lagi
 i too was sent to school to study but i used to feel more like playing
 hamaare samaaj main ladakiyon ko ghar ke kaam main nipun karne kii parampara he, khilne vaali ladkiyaan kam hi dikhaai padati hai
 People also refused but where was i going to believe
 meri maa bhi mujhe nahin tokati thi or meri maa jaisi didi lakshmi to jaise mere peeche diwaar banakar khadi rahati thim
 i played football, volleyball and hockey
 hockey khilne ke liye stick lekar jab nikalati thi to mohalle ke ladke kahaan baj aane vaale
 They used to ridicule me
 kehete the, dekho ja rahi he jhaansi kii rani banakar khilne, badi ai stick lekar chalane vaali
 Although i did not even care for the boys, but when i looked at the news, i used to stare and look at them, then they would fly away
 mujhe yaad he ki ek baar jab main 14 baras kii rahi houngi or cycle se ham donon bahanen kahin ja rahe the to ek jagah par lakshmi didi rukkar kisi se baat karne lageen or main thodaa aage nikalakar vahaan par unka intjaar karne lagi
 During that time some boys passed through the bicycle and asked me to leave the way
 maine manaa kar diya or kaha ki aage jagah he, udhar se nikal jaao
 He was adamant and i kept on my point
 is bich jab lakshmi didi aa gayi or ham chalane lage to kisi ladke ne jhapad maaraa jo meri didi ke gaal par lag gaya
 Taking advantage of the crowd, the boys ran away
 didi ke gaal par chaanta dekhakar mujhe bahut krodh aayaa
 i told Didi that let's find the boy and teach him a lesson
 didi ne manaa kiya lekin mere upar to jaise chandi savaar thi
 Both of us kept searching for those boys for a long time and wandered and came to the same place
 vahaan par paan kii dukaan par khadey ek ladke kii shart kaa kaaler dekhakar didi ne kaha ki yahi vah ladkaa he
 What was it again, i ran over and grabbed the boy and said to Didi, "mara didi, don't leave
 " There was a crowd, quite a ruckus but i did not leave
 ant main us ladke ke ghar vaale aae or maafee maangi tab jaakar maine use choda
 After that, no one looked at me or towards my sister
 lakshmi didi kii shaadi ho gai lekin mere prati unka itnaa pyaar rahata he ki vah sasuraal se zyada maayke main hi rahati hai or meri or meri maa-bhai kii madad karne ke liye hameshaa jaan die rahati hai
 My brother-in-law Om Prakash ji is like a god to us
 bajrangbali ne unhen jaise hamaare liye hi banaaya tha
 His shadow has helped me fulfill my dream
 maine inter kiya, elelbi kiya lekin khelnaa mere liye junun ke samaan hi tha
 i played volleyball-football in the surrounding districts, won many awards, but my passion kept growing
 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe
 maine sochaa ki kahin par naukari kar luun taaki usee ke saath aage badhati jaaun
 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli
 The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum
 i have not even passed Inter
 main kisi ke saath bhaag rahi thi
 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail eke jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati
 i angrily telephoned AK Jain and told him that were any of your soldiers present in the train who would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day? Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i should go to AK Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made my problem easy by the US resident Dr
 Rakesh Srivastava and his brother Shailesh Srivastava who run an organization called Innovative
 unhone mere liye ek kritrim pair banwaaya jisko pahanakar main chalati hum
 Ajay Maken gave me so much convenience and that too when the government of Uttar Pradesh took off to tell me the culprit and the media followed me
 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me
 
 ! " maine footbal, wollyboul or hockey kheli
 When the boy came out with a stick to play hockey, where are the boys from the neighborhood
 ve meri khilli udaate the
 They used to say, look, you are going to play as a queen of Jhansi, carrying a big eye stick
 main vaise to ladakon kii parvaah bhi nahin karti thi, lekin jab baat akharane vaali lagati thi to main ghurkar unki taraf dekhati thi, to ve udan-chhu ho jate the
 i remember that once i would be 14 years old and both our sisters were going somewhere by bicycle, then Lakshmi didi stopped at one place and started talking to someone and i went ahead and waited for her there
 us dauraan kuch ladke cycle se udhar se gujarey to mujhase rasta chhodane ko kaha
 i refused and said that there is a place ahead, get out of there
 ve apni baat par ade rahe or main apni baat par
 Meanwhile, when Lakshmi didi came and we started walking, a boy slapped me, which hit my sister's cheek
 bheed kaa laabh uthaakar ladke bhaag gaye
 i was very angry to see the sister on the cheek
 maine didi se kaha ki chalo us ladke ko dhundhakar sabak sikhaate hai
 Sister refused but Chandi was riding on me
 ham donon un ladakon ko kaaphi der tak talashte rahe or gum-phir kar usee jagah aa gaye
 Seeing the collar of a boy's shirt standing at the paan shop there, Didi said that this is the boy
 bas phir kya tha, maine daudkar us ladke ko daboch liya or didi se kaha, "maar didi, chhodana nahin
 " bheed lag gai, kaaphi bavaal hua lekin maine choda nahin
 Finally, the boy's housemates came and apologized and then i left him
 uske baad phir kisi ne meri taraf yaa meri didi kii taraf najar uthaakar bhi nahin dekha
 Laxmi Didi got married but she has so much love towards me that she lives in the maternal house more than her in-laws and always lives to help me and my mother-brother
 mere jija om prakaash ji bhi hamaare liye devtaa kii tarah hai
 Bajrangbali made them just like us
 unheen kii chhatrachhaaya ne mujhe meraa sapana puraa karne main madad kii he
 i did inter, LLB but playing was the same as passion for me
 maine aas-paas ke jilon main wollyboul-footbal khelaa, kai puraskaar jite, lekin meraa junun badhata hi gaya
 i also participated in sports at the national level but i did not get my rights
 mere paas haath-pair the, junun tha lekin koi seedhi nahin thi, koi chat nahin thi jo mujhe aage badhane detii, mujhe mahfuj rakhti
 i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that

 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya

 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa
 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali
 
 yah kya ho rahaa he meri jindagi ke saath
 
 or ab kya shesh rah gaya he hone ko? ankhon ke saamne kabhi maa kii tasviir aati to kabhi bhai to kabhi lakshmi didi kii to kabhi jija kii
 
 
 i found myself lying when the people came towards the railway tracks for toilet
 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital
 subah ke saat baje ke kareeb mujhe aspataal panhuchaya gaya
 My left leg was cut off
 media dwaara shor machaane par mujhe lakhanu ke troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 From there i was again taken to AIIMS
 doctoron ne mujhe bachaa liya
 CISF announced the hiring
 tatkaaleen rail mantri mamata banerjee ne bhi naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken gave considerable relief
 samaaj ko ye baaten hajam nahin huin
 With treatment, controversy also started that i am not a national level player
 maine inter bhi paas nahin kiya he
 i was running away with someone
 meri shaadi ho chuki he
 i did not participate in any competition
 main juthi hum, farebi hum
 UP ADG Rail AK Jain has proved me a liar by doing a press conference and said that i had attempted suicide by jumping from the train or i was crossing the railway line at midnight alone in that rugged desert area when this accident Decreased
 maine gusse main eke jain ko phone lagaakar khub sunaaya ki kya aapkaa koi sipaahi train main maujuud tha jo bataata ki us din train main mujhe luutane kii koshish nahin kii gai thi? kya raatbhar patariyon par pade hone ke baavjood jiarapy ne meri koi madad kii? man karata tha ki main eke jain ke paas jaakar unka munh noch luun
 My mother, my sister and brother-in-law at AIIMS explained to me what else does not happen to girls, people add acid, you have only got one leg, now plan ahead
 bahan kii prerana ne mere man main yah baat laa di ki kuch aisa karun jise duniya dekhe
 Why don't i climb Everest? i thought the best idea was to climb Everest without a foot
 asli chunauti yahi he
 Everyone does an easy job
 meri mushkil ko aasaan kar diya america nivasee dow rakesh shrivastav or unke bhai shailesh shrivastav ne jo innovative naam se ek sanstha chalaate hai
 They made a prosthetic leg for me which i wear
 mujhe ajay maakan ne itani sahuliyatein deen or vah bhi tab, jab uttar pradesh kii sarkaar mujhe mulgim bataane ke liye utaaru thi or media mere peeche pad gaya tha
 Players' organization 'sai' did not even consider me as a player
 main cheekh-cheekh kar kaha karti thi ki "main jinda hum, mujhase aakar pucho, main juthi nahin hum
 " lekin museebaton or parikshaon kaa ant abhi nahin hua tha
 My infamy was following me when i returned after spending four months in AIIMS
 mujhe viklaangata kaa pramaan patr mil gaya tha or rail se paas bhi
 But i did not get a ticket to run in the reserved coach of the second class of the train
 mujhe daudaya jaataa, shaq kiya jaataa
 For me, walking in a disabled bogey was like drinking bitter sips of insult
 arpeef ke sipaahi meri taang khulwakar dekhte or phir paas mangakar uski jaanch karte
 Once in Haridwar, the station master helped me a lot when i did not get a ticket
 unhone counter clerk se tikat dene ko kaha lekin usne kaha ki use mere paas par use shaq he
 It does not contain signatures
 ant main stesan master ne apane dam par mujhe jabardastee train main baithaaya
 Mamta Banerjee had announced the job
 jab main kritrim taangon se chalakar rail mantralay panhuchi to unke pie ne milaane se manaa kar diya
 Disappointed thrice, i returned
 railway board ke adhyaksh vivek sahay se milane main main kisi tarah kaamyaab ho gai to unka jawaab sunakar hairat hui
 He looked at all the papers and then said that first get a good report from the GRP
 ye thi railway ke mantri or adhyaksh kii maanviyata
 i did not lose courage
 kaha ki in sabko apni takat dikhaaungi, ye sab mujhe pahachaanenge or khud chalakar mere paas aaenge
 Bachendri Pal encouraged me a lot
 unheen ke prashikshan kii badaulat main aaj aasmaan ke itane kareeb hum
 i am on the peak of Mount Everest where not everyone can reach
 aisa lagata he ki bas haath uthaaun or chhu luun
 The comments mujhe bukhaar aa gaya
 And i had to return down to the world that did not want me to reach here
 lekin kuch log the jinka mere par vishwaas tha or unheen ke bharose main yahaan tak pahunchi hum
 My desire is to help people like myself with disabilities whom the society rejects
 main chaahati hum ki unke liye koi khel academy banaaun, unnav main saadhe saat bigha jameen mil gai he
 Have to buy three and a half bighas
 is academy se jab meri jaisi oonchi chahat rakhane vaale niklenge tab mujhe lagegaa ki mere saath jo kuch hua vah sab thik tha kyonki agar ye sab na hota to aane vaali peedi ko hausala koun de paata
 
 ! agle maheene kii 10 taarikh ko main 27 varsh kii ho jaaoongi
 i still have the courage to touch many heights
 bas, mujhe koi chunauti de dijie
 
 !" He was adamant and i kept on my point
 is bich jab lakshmi didi aa gayi or ham chalane lage to kisi ladke ne jhapad maaraa jo meri didi ke gaal par lag gaya
 Taking advantage of the crowd, the boys ran away
 didi ke gaal par chaanta dekhakar mujhe bahut krodh aayaa
 i told Didi that let's find the boy and teach him a lesson
 didi ne manaa kiya lekin mere upar to jaise chandi savaar thi
 Both of us kept searching for those boys for a long time and wandered and came to the same place
 vahaan par paan kii dukaan par khadey ek ladke kii shart kaa kaaler dekhakar didi ne kaha ki yahi vah ladkaa he
 What was it again, i ran over and grabbed the boy and said to Didi, "mara didi, don't leave
 " There was a crowd, quite a ruckus but i did not leave
 ant main us ladke ke ghar vaale aae or maafee maangi tab jaakar maine use choda
 After that, no one looked at me or towards my sister
 lakshmi didi kii shaadi ho gai lekin mere prati unka itnaa pyaar rahata he ki vah sasuraal se zyada maayke main hi rahati hai or meri or meri maa-bhai kii madad karne ke liye hameshaa jaan die rahati hai
 My brother-in-law Om Prakash ji is like a god to us
 bajrangbali ne unhen jaise hamaare liye hi banaaya tha
 His shadow has helped me fulfill my dream
 maine inter kiya, elelbi kiya lekin khelnaa mere liye junun ke samaan hi tha
 i played volleyball-football in the surrounding districts, won many awards, but my passion kept growing
 maine rashtriya str par bhi khelon main bhaag liya lekin mujhe meraa haq nahin mila
 i had hands and feet, passion but no ladder, no roof that would let me move forward, keep me safe
 maine sochaa ki kahin par naukari kar luun taaki usee ke saath aage badhati jaaun
 Put forms in many places
 siaisef main bhi koshish kii or ek din noida main siaisef ke daftar main jane ke liye ghar se nikal padi, akeli
 The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum
 i have not even passed Inter
 main kisi ke saath bhaag rahi thi
 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail eke jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati
 i angrily telephoned AK Jain and told him that were any of your soldiers present in the train who would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day? Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i should go to AK Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made my problem easy by the US resident Dr
 Rakesh Srivastava and his brother Shailesh Srivastava who run an organization called Innovative
 unhone mere liye ek kritrim pair banwaaya jisko pahanakar main chalati hum
 Ajay Maken gave me so much convenience and that too when the government of Uttar Pradesh took off to tell me the culprit and the media followed me
 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me
 
 ! " bheed lag gai, kaaphi bavaal hua lekin maine choda nahin
 Finally, the boy's housemates came and apologized and then i left him
 uske baad phir kisi ne meri taraf yaa meri didi kii taraf najar uthaakar bhi nahin dekha
 Laxmi Didi got married but she has so much love towards me that she lives in the maternal house more than her in-laws and always lives to help me and my mother-brother
 mere jija om prakaash ji bhi hamaare liye devtaa kii tarah hai
 Bajrangbali made them just like us
 unheen kii chhatrachhaaya ne mujhe meraa sapana puraa karne main madad kii he
 i did inter, LLB but playing was the same as passion for me
 maine aas-paas ke jilon main wollyboul-footbal khelaa, kai puraskaar jite, lekin meraa junun badhata hi gaya
 i also participated in sports at the national level but i did not get my rights
 mere paas haath-pair the, junun tha lekin koi seedhi nahin thi, koi chat nahin thi jo mujhe aage badhane detii, mujhe mahfuj rakhti
 i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that
 kai jagah farm daale
 Also tried in CISF and one day got out of the house to go to Noida's CISF office, alone
 vah din tha 11 april 2011 kaa
 i did not know that my world was going to change
 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa

 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital

 !" i thought that i should work somewhere so that i could move forward with that
 kai jagah farm daale
 Also tried in CISF and one day got out of the house to go to Noida's CISF office, alone
 vah din tha 11 april 2011 kaa
 i did not know that my world was going to change
 padmavati express train ke chaalu dibbe main khidki ke kinare ek seat par baithi raat ke andhere main jugnu jaisi kisi roshni kii talash kar rahi thi ki tabhi kuch 'lophar tip' ke ladke aae or unhone mere gale main padi chen par jhapatta maaraa
 i laughed
 in ladakon kii kya aukaat ki mujhase meri cheez chin len? maine ladke kaa haath pakadakar marod diya
 But when the other boy put his hand in my neck, then after removing my neck, the collar of my shirt came in place of the chain in his hand
 usne kaaler pakadakar ghasita or do-teen ladakon ne mujhe pakadakar daravaaje ke paas khinch liya
 It was not a difficult task for me to deal with them, but then the boys kicked at me such that i was seen rolling out of the moving train among the ballots
 
 
 pataa nahin kya hua, mujhe kuch pataa nahin ki mere pair ke upar se train ke kitne pahie guzarate chale gaye
 Were they the wheels of the Padmavat Express or the trains passing over the other tracks? At that time it was half past one and the train was near Bareilly
 lekin kuch sochane-samajhane se pehle dard ke aaveg ne mujhe besudh kar diya
 When i would break my sleep in between, i would see that i was lying on the side of the train tracks, i had a leg cut off, just some meat had kept it attached to my body
 bagal kii patari se rah-rahakar trainen guzar rahi thim
 The distance between the track and me was only a few inches
 main apane ko patari se dur karnaa chaahati thi lekin mere paas itnaa dam kahaan tha, us par bheeshan dard
 i lay in that rugged night the same way
 jab mujhe hosh aata to bajrangbali ko yaad karke yahi kahati ki jai bajrangbali
 
 yah kya ho rahaa he meri jindagi ke saath
 
 or ab kya shesh rah gaya he hone ko? ankhon ke saamne kabhi maa kii tasviir aati to kabhi bhai to kabhi lakshmi didi kii to kabhi jija kii
 
 
 i found myself lying when the people came towards the railway tracks for toilet
 gaanv vaale aae
 Asked my name and address
 shaayad aadhi behoshee main maine ghar kaa telephone number bataa diya tha
 The brother-in-law asked him to do so much help and reach Arunima to a hospital
 subah ke saat baje ke kareeb mujhe aspataal panhuchaya gaya
 My left leg was cut off
 media dwaara shor machaane par mujhe lakhanu ke troma centre main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 From there i was again taken to AIIMS
 doctoron ne mujhe bachaa liya
 CISF announced the hiring

 The then Sports Minister Ajay Maken gave considerable relief

 With treatment, controversy also started that i am not a national level player
 maine inter bhi paas nahin kiya he
 i was running away with someone
 meri shaadi ho chuki he
 i did not participate in any competition
 main juthi hum, farebi hum
 UP ADG Rail AK Jain has proved me a liar by doing a press conference and said that i had attempted suicide by jumping from the train or i was crossing the railway line at midnight alone in that rugged desert area when this accident Decreased
 maine gusse main eke jain ko phone lagaakar khub sunaaya ki kya aapkaa koi sipaahi train main maujuud tha jo bataata ki us din train main mujhe luutane kii koshish nahin kii gai thi? kya raatbhar patariyon par pade hone ke baavjood jiarapy ne meri koi madad kii? man karata tha ki main eke jain ke paas jaakar unka munh noch luun
 My mother, my sister and brother-in-law at AIIMS explained to me what else does not happen to girls, people add acid, you have only got one leg, now plan ahead
 bahan kii prerana ne mere man main yah baat laa di ki kuch aisa karun jise duniya dekhe

 !" The day was 11 April 2011
 mujhe nahin maaloom tha ki meri duniya badalane ja rahi he
 Sitting on a seat by the side of the window in the running compartment of the Padmavati Express train, in the dark of night, looking for a light like firefly that some 'loafer type' boys came and they swooped on the chain lying around my neck
 mujhe hansi aa gai
 What is the point of these boys taking away my thing from me? i held the boy's hand and jerked it
 lekin tabhi duusare ladke ne mere gale main haath daalaa to mere gardan hataa lene par uske haath main chen kii jagah meri shart kaa kaaler aa gaya
 He dragged him by holding the collar and two-three boys caught me and pulled him near the door
 mere liye unase nibatna mushkil kaam nahin tha lekin tabhi ladakon ne mere upar aisi laat maari ki main chalati train se baahar gittiyon ke bich lotati si najar ai
 
 
 i do not know what happened, i do not know how many wheels of the train passed over my foot
 ve pahie padmavat express ke the yaa duusari patari ke upar se guzarane vaali trainon ke? us samay raat ke dedh baje the or train bareli ke paas thi
 But the impulse of pain made me unaware before thinking anything
 bich-bich main meri tandra tuutati to dekhati ki main train kii patariyon ke kinare padi hum, meri ek taang cat gai thi bas kuch maance bhar ne use mere sharir se jode rakhaa tha
 Trains were passing by side by side
 patari or mere bich maatr kuch inchon kaa hi faasla tha
 i wanted to derail myself, but where did i have so much pain, a terrible pain
 main us behad raat main usee tarah padi rahi
 When i was conscious, i would remember Bajrangbali and say that Jai Bajrangbali
 
 What is happening with my life? 
 And what is left to happen now? Sometimes a picture of a mother came in front of her eyes, sometimes brother, sometimes Lakshmi didi and sometimes brother-in-law
 
 
 pau fatne par jab log shouch ke liye railway kii patariyon kii taraf aae to mujhe padaa paaya
 The villagers came
 meraa naam-pataa poocha
 Perhaps in the faint sense i had told the telephone number of the house
 jija ne unase kaha ki itani madad or kar dijie ki arunima ko kisi aspataal tak panhucha dijie
 i was taken to the hospital around 7 am
 meri bain taang kaat di gai
 i was admitted to the trauma center in Lucknow after the media made noise
 vahaan se phir mujhe ames le jaaya gaya
 The doctors saved me
 siaiesaf ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The then Railway Minister Mamta Banerjee also announced the job
 tatkaaleen khel mantri ajay maakan ne kaaphi raahaten deen
 The society did not digest these things
 ilaaj ke saath hi vivaad bhi shuru ho gaya ki main rashtriya str kii khilaadi nahin hum

 i am married
 maine kisi pratiyogita main bhaag nahin liya
 i am a liar, a fraud
 upi ke ediji rail eke jain ne to baqayada press conference karke mujhe jhootha sabit kiya or kaha ki maine train se kudakar aatmahatya kii koshish kii thi yaa phir main us behad sunsaan ilaake main akele aadhi raat ko railway line paar kar rahi thi, jab yah durghatana ghati
 i angrily telephoned AK Jain and told him that were any of your soldiers present in the train who would tell that there was no attempt to rob me in the train that day? Did GRP help me despite being on the tracks overnight? i used to think that i should go to AK Jain and face him
 ames main meri maa, meri bahan or jija ne mujhe samajhaayaa ki or ladakiyon ke saath kya-kya nahin hota, log tejaab tak daal dete hai, tumhaara to bas ek pair hi gaya he, ab aage kii yojana banaao
 Sister's inspiration brought to my mind that i should do something that the world sees
 kyon na everest par chadh jaaun? bina pair ke everest par chadhana hi mujhe sabase behatar vichaar laga
 This is the real challenge
 aasaan kaam to har koi kar letaa he
 Made my problem easy by the US resident Dr
 Rakesh Srivastava and his brother Shailesh Srivastava who run an organization called Innovative
 unhone mere liye ek kritrim pair banwaaya jisko pahanakar main chalati hum
 Ajay Maken gave me so much convenience and that too when the government of Uttar Pradesh took off to tell me the culprit and the media followed me
 khilaadiyon kaa sanghathan 'sai' bhi mujhe khilaadi nahin maanata tha
 i used to scream and say, "I am alive, come and ask me, i am not a liar
" " But the troubles and ordeals were not yet over
 chaar maheene ames main gujaarne ke baad jab main waapas lauti to meri badanaami meraa peechha kar rahi thi
 i got a certificate of disability and also a pass by rail
 lekin mujhe train ke senkad class kii arakshit bogi main chalane ke liye tikat nahin miltaa tha
 i was run, suspected
 mere liye viklang bogi main chalanaa bhi apmaan ke kadave ghunt pine ke samaan hi tha
 RPF soldiers would see my leg openly and then ask for a pass and check it
 ek baar to haridwar main jab mujhe tikat nahin mila to stesan master ne bahut madad kii
 He asked the counter clerk to give him the ticket but he said that he suspected me of it
 usamen hastakshar thik nahin hai
 In the end, the station master forced me to board the train on my own
 mamata banerjee ne naukari dene kii ghoshnaa kii thi
 When i reached the Ministry of Railways through artificial legs, their PA refused to join
 teen baar niraash hokar main laut ai
 When i somehow managed to meet Railway Board Chairman Vivek Sahai, i was surprised to hear his answer
 unhone saare kagajaat dekhe or phir kaha ki pehle jiarapy se badhiya si report lagavakar lao
 This was the humanism of the railway minister and chairman
 maine himmat nahin haari
 Said that i will show my strength to all of them, they will all recognize me and come to me on their own
 mujhe bachhendri paal ne kaaphi protsaahit kiya
 Due to his training, i am so close to the sky today
 main mount everest kii chotii par hum jahaan par har koi nahin panhuch paata he
 It seems that just raise my hand and touch it
 tippaniyan i have a fever
 or neeche bhi lautnaa tha us duniya main jo nahin chaahati thi ki main yahaan tak pahunchun
 But there were some people who believed in me and i have reached here only because of them
 meri ichha apane jaise viklang logon kii madad karne kii he, jinhen samaaj thukraata he
 i want to build a sports academy for him, seven and a half bighas of land have been found in Unnao
 saadhe teen bigha or kharidni he
 When those who have high desires like me will come out of this academy, then i will feel that everything that happened to me was fine because if it had not happened then who would have been able to give encouragement to the next generation
 
 ! i will turn 27 on the 10th of next month
 mujhamen abhi bahut si oonchaaiyon ko chune kaa hausala baaki he
 Just challenge me

 notebandi ko lekar media ke kawarej par kai sawaal uthaaye ja rahe hai
 It is being said that the role of the media on demonetisation was not good and the benefits of demonetisation were not written
 kya is aarope main koi sachai he ki media ne aisa kiya he yaa media ne vah dikhaaya jo sach he? electronic media main kya dikhaaya gaya uskaa akalan karnaa kaaphi mushkil he lekin chaliye kuch aise bade angreji akhbaaron ke sheershak ke upar nazar daalate hai jinamein pichley kuch dinon se notebandi se judi khabaron ne apni jagah banaai he
 On November 8, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the closure of 500 and 1000 rupee notes, on November 9, the title of almost all the big newspapers was brilliant
 kolkata se chhapane vaale angreji akhbaar “da telegraph” kaa sheershak tha “500 or hazaar ke note kaa unmoolan ho gaya” iske saath-saath isse jude har pahalu ko dhyaan se likhaa gaya tha
 What people should do, how to replace the old notes further, was also carefully written on all these
 dilli se chhapane vaale ‘indian express’ kaa sheershak tha “da great cash clin ap”
 This was the only news on the front page of the Indian Express
 indian express ne is kadam ko adwitiya bataaya tha
 The Times of India wrote in its title 'black out: 500 and 1000 rupee notes are no longer valid
 ' times of india ne is khabar ko teror funding ke khilaaf 'sargical strike' bataaya tha
 The Hindustan Times, an English newspaper published from Delhi, wrote 'the Black Buck stops here' under the title
 10 november or 15 november ke bich notebandi kii vajah se aam aadmi ko ho rahi samasya ke bare main likhaa gaya
 Long queues at atms, shortage of cash in the bank, problems with farmers and small traders as well as others were given more attention
 15 november ko bade-bade akhbaaron kaa sheershak kuch alag tha
 'the Telegraph' placed the problem on account of lack of cash on its front page, such as how farmers are not able to sow due to lack of cash, how the trade of small traders due to demonetisation Has come to a standstill
 'times of india' ne likhaa tha ki log bainkon ke bahaar sangharsh kar rahe hai or netaa house ke andar yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hai yani vipaksh is nirnay ke khilaaf sansad ke andar sarkaar ko gherne ke liye taiyaari kar rahaa he
 The Indian Express had given place to other news related to demonetisation as well as Prime Minister Modi's statement in which he attacked the opposition
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha, 'congress waalon ne to apane kushi ke liye 19 maheene desh ko jail-khaanaa bana diya tha
 i have prayed for 50 days to suffer a little trouble for the happiness of the poor
 ' pradhanmantri ke dwaara istemaal kadak chaay vaali baton ko lagbhag sabhi akhbaaron main jagah di gai thi
 The Prime Minister said that the poor people like my bitter tea but it becomes the mouth of the rich
 hindustan times ne cash nikaalane ke niyam ko lekar jo badlaav hua tha use apane pehle panne par jagah di thi, jisamen yah bataaya gaya tha ki karant acount dharak ek hafte main 5 xxrep 4 0 hazaar rupaya teen maheene tak uthaa sakate hai or atm se paisa uthaane se koi charge nahin lagegaa
 Then on November 16, the Winter Session of Parliament began and there was a daily uproar in the Parliament regarding demonetisation
 is khabar ko bhi akhbaaron main jagah mili
 Along with this, on the problems that were being faced by the general public regarding demonetisation, newspapers gave a place with complete details
 akhbaaron kii is reporting ko sangyaan main lete hue logon kii samasya ko dur karne ke liye sarkaar kii taraf se bhi kai kadam bhi uthaaye gaye
 The comments 25 november ko bade angrezi akhbaaron main manmohan singh chhaae hue the
 On 24 November, Manmohan Singh raised several questions in the Rajya Sabha on the government's decision on demonetisation
 'da telegraph' ne apane pehle panne par manmohan singh kii aalochana ko jagah dete hue “manmohan kaa missile” likhaa tha jabaki times of india ne notebandi par sarkaar ke dwaara uthaaye gaye kuch badlaav ko pramukhataa di thi
 In the Indian Express on 26 November, the criticism given by the Prime Minister about the opposition was given prominence, in which the Prime Minister said that the opposition is angry because they did not get time to settle their money
 27 november ko telegraph ne fidel kastro kii maut kii khabar kaaphi vistaar se chhaapi thi
 On 28 November, the Indian Express gave space to Khalistan Militant, who had fled from the Punjab Jail, on his front page, as well as the attack the Prime Minister had made against the opposition on the Bharat Bandh
 29 november ko “da telegraph” ne kolkata main hue bharat band kii vifaltaa ko apane pehle panne par jagah di thi
 In this way, all those news about demonetisation should have got place in the last few days
 sarkaar kii tarif ke saath-saath aalochana bhi hui
 Whatever criticism came was not against the government's demonetisation decision but on the problems being faced by the people through demonetisation
 yani sawaal sarkaar kii ranneetiyon par uthaaya gaya tha
 Due to this criticism, the government also got a chance to correct its mistake and the government took new steps to solve the problems of the people
 8 november ko jab pradhanmantri narendra modi ne 500 or 1000 rupee ke note band karne kaa elaan kiya tab 9 november ko lagbhag sabhi bade akhbaaron kaa sheershak shandaar tha
 The English newspaper "the Telegraph" from Kolkata was titled "500 and thousand notes were eradicated" along with every aspect of it was carefully written
 logon ko kya karnaa chahie, aage puraane noton ko kaise badla ja saktaa he, in sab par bhi dhyaan se likhaa gaya tha
 The Indian Express, published from Delhi, was titled "the Great Cash Clean Up"
 indian express ke pehle panne par sirf yahi khabar chai hui thi
 The Indian Express described the move as unique
 times of india ne apane sheershak main likhaa 'blike out : 500 or 1000 rupee ke note ab or maanya nahin hai
 The Times of India called the news a 'surgical strike' against Terror funding
 dilli se chhapane vaale angreji akhbaar hindustan times ne sheershak main 'da blike bak stops hiyar' likhaa tha
 Between 10 November and 15 November, the problem was caused to the common man due to demonetisation
 ATM ke bahaar lambii qatari, bank main cash kii kami, kisaan or chote vyapaariyon ke saath-saath duusare logon ko ho rahi dikqaton par zyada dhyaan diya gaya tha
 The headlines of big newspapers on 15 November were somewhat different
 'da telegraph' ne cash kii kami ke vajah se ho rahi samasya ko apane pehle panne par jagah di thi, jaise cash kii kami kii vajah se kaise kisaan buvaai nahin kar paa rahe hai, notebandi kii vajah se kaise chote-chote kaarobaariyon kaa vyapaar thap ho gaya he
 The Times of India wrote that people are struggling outside the banks and leaders are getting ready for war inside the house, i
e
 the opposition is preparing to surround the government inside Parliament against this decision
 indian express ne notebandi se judi duusari khabar ke saath-saath pradhanmantri modi ke us bayaan ko bhi jagah di thi jisamen unhone vipaksh par hamalaa bolaa tha
 The Prime Minister had said, 'congressmen had made the country jail-eating for 19 months for their happiness
 maine to garibon kii khushi ke liye 50 din thodi si takaleef jhelane kii prarthana kii he
 'the talk of bitter tea used by the Prime Minister was given place in almost all the newspapers
 pradhanmantri ne kaha tha bole ki meri kadak chaay garibon ko pasand aati he lekin amir kaa munh ban jaataa he
 Hindustan Times gave the change on the cash withdrawal rule to its front page, which stated that current account holders can raise 5 xxrep 4 0 thousand rupees in a week for three months and any money can be raised from ATM Will not charge
 phir 16 november ko sansad kaa sheetakaaleen satr shuru hua or sansad ke andar notebandi ko lekar rose hangaamaa hona shuru ho gaya
 This news also found a place in newspapers
 iske saath-saath notebandi ko lekar aam janata ko jo pareshaaniyaan ho rahi thim us par bhi akhbaaron ne puri detail ke saath jagah di
 Taking this reporting of the newspapers into consideration, several steps were also taken by the government to overcome the problem of the people
 tippaniyan On 25 November, Manmohan Singh dominated the big English newspapers
 24 november ko manmohan singh ne rajyasabha main sarkaar ke notebandi ke nirnay par kai sawaal uthaae the
 The Telegraph wrote "manmohan's missile" on its front page, criticizing Manmohan Singh, while the Times of India highlighted some of the changes taken by the government on demonetisation
 26 november ke indian express main vipaksh ko lekar pradhanmantri dwaara kii gai aalochana ko pramukhataa di gai thi jisamen pradhanmantri ne kaha tha ki vipaksh isliye naaraaz he kyonki unako apane paise ko thikaane lagane ke liye samay nahin mila
 On 27 November, the Telegraph published in great detail the news of Fidel Castro's death
 28 november ko indian express ne punjab jail se bhaage khalistaan militant ko apane pehle panne par jagah dene ke saath-saath pradhanmantri ne bharat band ko lekar vipaksh ke upar jo hamalaa bolaa tha use bhi jagah di thi
 On 29 November, "the Telegraph" put the failure of the Bharat Bandh in Kolkata on its front page
 is tarah pichley kuch dinon main notebandi ko lekar un sabhi khabaron ko jagah mili jo milani chahie thi
 The government was praised as well as criticism
 jo bhi aalochana hui vah sarkaar ke notebandi nirnay ke khilaaf nahin thi balki notebandi se logon ko ho rahi pareshaaniyon par thi
 That is, the question was raised on the strategies of the government
 is aalochana kii vajah se sarkaar ko apni galati sudhaarney kaa mauqaa bhi mila or logon kii samasya dur karne ke liye sarkaar ne nae-nae kadam bhi uthaaye

 Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has warned that global markets are at risk of 'collapsing' as developed countries adopt loose monetary policies in the form of competition
 rajan ne kaha ki vittiya kshetra main jo maujuuda asantulan ban rahaa he, usase bazaaron main achaanak giravat aa sakati he or daam neeche gir sakate hai
 This can cause sudden volatility in the markets
 unhone kaha, ham ek or baari giravat kii taraf bad rahe hai or vah bhi aise samay, jab duniya kii arthvyavasthaaen aise jatke ko sahane kii bahut kam kshamta rakhte hai
 "unfortunately, many macroeconomists in the world have not learned from the major financial crisis," Rajan said in an interview to the London-based Central Banking Journal
 vah ab bhi vittiya kshetra par puraa dhyaan nahin de rahe hai
 The financial sector crisis cannot be said to be completely sure beforehand
 yah jab tak aapako jhatka nahin de detaa he, tab tak badhata rahata he
 The Governor of the Reserve Bank said that the central banks no longer have much options in the financial sector
 aisi sthiti banane ja rahi he, jab vittiya khetra main nirantarata kaa baari abhaav ban jayega
 He disagreed on the argument of some economists that prices are not going up due to increase in debt
 rajan ne kaha ki rin vruddhi kii vajah se samasya badhati nahin lag rahi he, haalanki kuch ubharate bazaaron main yah ek mudda he
 Rajan reiterated his warning that due to unexpected adjustment in monetary policies in rich countries, capital inflows are changing drastically and emerging market economies are more vulnerable to this

 Nitish Kumar said, "on one hand he says that i am a petitioner and on the other hand he accuses me of being egoistic

 jediu main baagiyon kii bad rahi gatividhiyon ke dekhte hue nitish kumaar kheme ne ek nayaa master stroke khelaa he
 Neeraj Kumar, considered the party's councilor and close to Nitish Kumar, presented a plan to the party
 unke plan ke mutabik rajya kii teenon rajyasabha siton par jediu apana ummidavaar hi na utaare or ucch rajnatik maandand kaa parichay de
 This is because the three seats won were not in the JDU camp
 haalanki sankhya bal aisi he ki jediu akele dam par teenon siten jeet sakati he par party ne ye nayaa daanv khelaa he
 As soon as the bet was gone, the JDU also removed its spokesperson in support of it and it was said that the party was seriously considering Neeraj Kumar's proposal
 darasal baagiyon se nipatane kaa ye nitish kumaar kaa nayaa plan ho saktaa he, jisamen ek tir se kai nishane saadh liye jaaenge
 However, discussions continue at Nitish Kumar's house since the evening, because if this plan is accurate, it would mean Sharad Yadav not reaching Rajya Sabha
 pichley kuch dinon se bihar main jediu ke baagiyon kii taadaad lagaataar badhati ja rahi he
 Most of them are close to Sharad Yadav, in such a situation that if Nitish Kumar's plan fits well, then the fight between Nitish and Sharad camp can come across
 is plan ke bare main vidhaan parshad niraj kumaar ne kaha, 'haa, hamane party ko ye plan diya he ki kisi ko bhi rajyasabha nahin bheja jaae, kyonki jab nitish kumaar ne ucch aadarshon kaa paalan karte hue apane pad se istipha diya to ye teenon site duusare dalon kii he
 In such a situation, we should not claim these seats
 'udhar, party pravaktaa ajay alok ne bhi saaf kar diya ki party main isapar gambhirtha se vichaar chal rahaa he ki rajyasabha main kisi ko nahin bheja jaae, rahi baat sharad yadav kii to party kaa faisla unka hi faisla hoga kyonki wo party ke sarvocch netaa he
 JDU Spokesperson Ajay Alok said, 'nitish camp suspects that the rebels within the party are giving air to Sharad Yadav and the party feels that if JDU fielded candidates in all three seats in the election, mass cross voting could happen 
 aise main rajyasabha main ummidavaar nahin utaarne kaa faisla party ko bachaane ke saath-saath baagiyon par lagaam lagane kaa bada kadam ho saktaa he
 Sharad Yadav is reaching Patna late Saturday night
 iske baad isapar faisla hoga lekin saaf he ki party ne ye daanv chalakar ek tir se kai nishane saadh liye hai
 On the one hand, Sharad Yadav may have to struggle to take a seat for himself, on the other hand, the responsibility of putting a check on the rebels can also be put on him

 cybar cell kii madad se donon ko elahabaad se pakadaa gaya, chunki ladki ne 12veen main 90% ank praapt kiye the or vah intellegent bhi he isliye shaq ki koi gunjaais nahin thi
 Some students were irritated by the friendship of the girl and her friend after coming to college and they took a photo of the girl at an ice cream shop and edited her face and made fake ID and pressurized them to let us have a wrong relationship with the girl too
 ladke or ladki ne pareshaan hokar apane haathon kii nas katkar suicide kaa plan banaaya, lekin ladki ne kaha nemawar jaakar narmada nadi main kud kar jaan denge or unhone koshish bhi kii lekin bheed dekhakar laut aae, phir harda railway treks par jaakar baith gaye, vahaan bhi logon ne unhen pakadakar hataa diya
 He felt that if he could not commit suicide and other people would misunderstand us, then he left for Allahabad by sitting in a truck
 is bich police lagaataar unki lokation tres kar rahi thi
 The police messaged their families that you return is not your fault, so they did not take any wrong step
 ladki ke dost amit (badla hua naam) ne bayaan diya, ‘ham donon main dosti thi, lekin class main kuch logon ko ye acha nahin laga
 He made vulgar messages to both of us, started threatening us, making our porn profiles and editing my friend's photo

 We felt that no one would believe us, so we both made a plan to commit suicide, tried three times but could not succeed, then went to Allahabad
 hamane apane professor ko farji idi banane or aatmahatya karne kaa massej kar diya tha
 We wrote that we are going to die, we were caught by someone who tried to die, then the Allahabad Police caught us and we were able to meet our family members

 com / vfoztfsaya — Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) April 11, 2017 In fact, many of Billy's decisions on the field have been hinted at, which led to his popularity
 ballebaajon ko out dete vakt unhone sidhi ungali nahin dikhaai, balki use mode lee
 AIADMK chief and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa said that her party has not decided on the presidential election yet and no one has been approached on the issue so far
 ensitisi kii baithak main dilli ravaanaa hone se pehle unhone samvaadadaataaon se kaha, annadramuk ne abhi tak koi rukh nahin apanaaya he or is prastaav ke saath abhi tak mujhase kisi ne sampark nahin kiya he
 She said that she is going to the national capital to attend the conference and there are no other plans
 jayalalita ke alaava gaiyr-congressi mukhyamantri mamata banerjee (pashchim bengal), narendra modi (gujarat) or naveen patnayak (odisha) bhi vivaadaaspad rashtriya aatankwaad nirodhak centre ke khilaaf hai
 He claims that it is against the federal structure and demanded that it be discussed separately
 unhone kaha ki sammelan main hissaa lene ke liye vah rashtriya rajdhani ja rahi hai or koi duusari yojana nahin he
 Apart from Jayalalithaa, non-congress chief ministers Mamata Banerjee (west Bengal), Narendra Modi (gujarat) and Naveen Patnaik (odisha) are also against the controversial National Counter Terrorism Center
 unka daawa he ki yah sangheey dhaanche ke khilaaf he or maang kii ki is par alag se charchaa ho
 An admission form given by the Government of Haryana in private schools is in the headlines
 darasal is form main kuch aise sawaal puche gaye hai, jisase har koi hairaan he
 In this form, students have been asked for information related to their family, caste, religion, Aadhaar card, bank account
 saath hi form main sawaal poocha gaya he ki kya unke maa-baap koi 'asvachh yaa galat' kaam to nahin karte hai?bataa den ki pradesh ke privet skulon ne bacchon ko kareeb 100 sawaalon vaala ek form diya he, jisamen bacchon se unki nijee jaankaree lee gai he
 Also, many such questions have been asked, which are not commonly asked in school form
 khaas baat ye he ki yah sawaal shiksha vibhaag kii ore se jari kiya gaya he or skulon ke liye aavashyak he
 Now questions on JEE exam, questions like model paper of coaching center, private schools are avoiding it in this case and they say that it is not being given by the school but from the government
 indian express kii report ke anusaar gurugram sector 45 kii deepies principal kaa kahana he ki sarkaar ne hamen parivaar waalon se ye form bharwane ke liye kaha he
 Many parents have refused to give information like income, bank account
 unhone ye bataaya ki skool is tarah kii jaankaree nahin leti he or agar kisi ko koi dikkat he to use sarkaar se baat kerani hogi
 At the same time, Leader of Opposition in Haryana Legislative Assembly Abhay Chautala from Haryana's main opposition party Indian National Lok Dal on this whole matter said that the government raises such disputes about castes as a deliberate strategy so that the government's failures and public Attention issues diverted public attention
 abhaya chautaala ne is parforma ko lekar khatter sarkaar par nishaanaa saadhaa he
 Chautala said that the Khattar government has raised controversy in the past three and a half years
 is puure maamle par congress kaa kahana he ki bijepi sarkaar apane kareeb 4 saal ke kaarykaal kii vifaltaaon ko chhipaane ke liye har baat kaa thikra pichhali congress sarkaar par phod detii he or agar is form main koi galtiyaan pichley kuch saalon se hoti aa rahi thi to kyon nahin bijepi sarkaar ne ise apane kareeb 4 saal ke kaarykaal main thik kiya yaa form ko badalawaane kii koshish kii
 NCERT books will be read in place of left: Tripura CM, while Congress has targeted Manohar Lal Khattar government on this form
 party ke pravaktaa randeep surajevaala ne twit kar kaha he ki 'khatter sarkaar ne phir vahi kiya
 Describing the students as ‘untouchables’ and their parents ’profession as‘ unclean ’
 ' unhone kaha ki khatter sarkaar ne 100 binduon vaala form jari kiya he
 In fact it is like keeping a watch on students and their parents
 jis tarah se unki vyaktigat soochna maangi ja rahi he wo aapattijanak he
 It is absurd to call the profession of parents as unclean
 nigaraanee karnaa bijepi ke diene main shaamil he
 The part of the form describes "unclean Occupation", tell me BJP and Khattar saheb, what is the occupation which they consider dirty? Is the work or wages of the sweeper not approved by them? Are they not allowed to do manual labor and earn a living by their hard work? 3 / https: / / t

 Former Union Minister Prithviraj Chavan and NCP leader Ajit Pawar were sworn in as the Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra respectively
 maharashtra ke rajyapal ke shankaranarayanan ne prithviraj chavaan ko rajya ke mukhyamantri ke rup main shapath dilaayi
 The Congress handed over the command of Prithviraj Chavan to Maharashtra to wash the blot of the Adarsh scam, while the NCP also replaced the deputy CM
 buudhvaar ko mumbai hawaii adde par prithviraj chavaan kaa zordaar swaagat hua
 Congress workers were so excited that when they were prevented from entering the airport, they clashed with the CISF personnel
 mumbai pahunchane ke baad prithviraj chavaan, ensipi ke ajit pavaar or congress-ensipi ke vidhayakon ke saath rajbhavan bhi ho aae
 Along with the new CM, Maharashtra is also getting a new deputy CM
 ensipi ne chagan bhujabal ko hataakar unki kursi sharad pavaar ke bhattije ajit pavaar ko bhent kar di he, lekin kaha ye ja rahaa he ki bhujabal ne khud ajit kaa naam sujhaayaa tha
 Meanwhile, the discussion was heated that Bhujbal's mood deteriorated due to the decision to replace the deputy CM and he agreed only after much persuasion
 haalanki bhujabal fir bhi mantri bane rahenge
