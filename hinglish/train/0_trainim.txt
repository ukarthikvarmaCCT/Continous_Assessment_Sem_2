 ' On Mahashivaratri, we worship Lord Bhole, but have you ever thought that Lord Shiva is always with God
 aakhir koun he ye gana? kya he inkaa mahatv? chaliye aaj dete he aapke in prashnon kaa jawaab or samajhate hai ganon kii maaya-bhagwaan shiv ke ganon kaa kai alag-alag tareeke se varnan kiya gaya he
 Some call him a friend of Shiva and some protect him
 asaliyat main gana mahadev ke mitra bhi hai or rakshak bhi
 They are his friends and companions
 puraanon main shiv ke pramukh gana he- bhairav, virbhadra, manibhadra, chandis, nandi, jai, vijay or aadi
 It is believed that these Ganas were different from humans and came from another world
 inke sharir main haddiyaan nahin hoti thi or aakaar vicitra sa hota tha
 These Gana languages also did not speak like humans and simply made noise
 iske chalate sabhi log unhen sanakee kehete the, lekin sirf bholenath the jo unke us shor ko samajhate or unako apana hitaishi maanate
 It is believed that Shiva visited Mansarovar 15000 years ago
 maansarovar ko tethis samudr kaa ek avshesh ke rup main janaa jaataa he or aisa mana jaataa he ki maanav sabhyataa kii shuruyaat us samay hui thi
 Currently that sea has now turned into a lake
 gajpati yaa ganpati?kabhi aapane sochaa he ki ham bhagwaan ganesh ko ganpati kyon bolte hai or gajpati kyon nahi? ham sab is baat se avgat hai ki ganesh ji ko hathi kaa sar lagaaya gaya tha
 Let me tell you, once when Mata Parvati was taking a bath, she told Ganesha not to let anyone come inside the room
 ganesh ne unki ajna kaa paalan kiya or kisi ko bhi andar aane nahin diya
 But then Mahadev came to meet Mata Parvati
 lekin balak ganesh ne unhen bhi aane se roak diya kyonki ve avgat the hi nahin ki ye unke pita hai
 Enraged by this, Lord Shiva separated Ganesh from his head
 baad main jab mahadev ko apni bhul kaa ahsaas hua to unhone ek hathi kaa sar unako laga diya
 This is a matter of legend, but the question is why we call Ganesh Ganapati and why not Gajapati
 vaise agar ganesh ji ko hathi kaa sar lagaaya gaya tha, to hamen to unhen gajpati kahana chahie, lekin ham unhen ganpati kahkar sambodhit karte hai
 This is because the elephant, which Lord Shiva had applied to the head of Ganesha, was itself a gana
 ji haa, bholenath ne apane ek gana kaa sar nikaalkar ganesh ko laga diya tha
 Therefore we call him Ganapati and not Gajapati
 vaise bataa den pishaach, daitya, daanav, or bhoot bhi bholenath ke gana he or hameshaa unke sameep rahete hai

 The Congress celebrated its 130th Foundation Day today
 is mauqe par congress adhyaksh sonia gandhi ne nai dilli sthit party mukhyalay main party kaa jhanda fahraaya
 But Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi was not present on this occasion
 congress party kii taraf se rahul kii gairmaujuudagi kii vajah ko lekar koi safai nahin di gai
 Even in this connection, no information was given from Rahul Gandhi's office despite being contacted by NDTV
 charchaa par bharosa karen to rahul 'baahar' hai
 Rahul Gandhi has every right to stay outside the house, stay outside Delhi or even go out of the country
 ek vyakti ke taur par unke baahar rahane ke har adhikaar kaa sammaan or samarthan kiya janaa chahie
 But questions arise when, as a leader, he stays out of the ceremony on the occasion of the party's foundation day
 baahar rahane kii do vajahen ho sakati hai
 Personal or party
 partigat vajah se vah baahar hote to party yaa unke daftar kii taraf is bare main zarur kuch na kuch soochna aati jaisaa pehle aati rahi hai
 But in the absence of any such information, we are free to assume that their exit is not associated with any party event, going to any party delegation or any other such activity
 duusari vajah
 His going out can be associated with attending a private event or attending a New Year celebration
 koi nitant vyaktigat vajah ho sakati he, jis par hamen bolne kaa haq nahin
 But keep in mind that he lives a public life as an individual as well as a Congress Vice President
 desh kii aam janata ko is baat se koi ferq nahin padataa ki congress ke sthapana diwas ke mauqe par vah kahaan rahe, lekin unki party ke kaaryakartaaon ko zarur ferq padataa he
 Two days ago, party general secretary Digvijay Singh while addressing a gathering in Madhya Pradesh said that Rahul Gandhi should lead the 'full time' of the party
 unke kehane kaa aashay shaayad yahi tha ki party ko puraa vakt dena chahie
 Rahul is giving full time and will also give
 ho saktaa he hameshaa ve aisa karte vakt media main na dikhnaa chaahate hon
 It is also necessary to maintain the necessary confidentiality
 lekin jab mauqaa sthapana diwas kaa ho to apane netaaon or kaaryakartaaon ke bich party ko puraa vakt dete dikhnaa zaruri ho jaataa he
 It is true that Sonia Gandhi is still taking all the responsibility of the party
 har bade faisle le rahi hai
 Frustrated with the defeat, the party is trying to give a new direction and condition
 lekin aglaa bagdor rahul ko sanbhaalanaa he to aise ahm mauqon par unki gairmaujuudagi nahin chalegi
 There has already been talk of Rahul being serious about politics
 lekin jab party ko phir se khadaa karne kii zimmedaari uthaani he to ab gambhirtha dikhni padegi
 You will have to come to such party events which symbolically mean a lot to the leaders and activists
 isse pehle sonia gandhi ne jab tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke sammaan main dinar kaa aayojan kiya tha, rahul tab bhi gaayab the
 There was a noise when information came abroad
 unke daftar kii taraf se safai di gai ki vah manmohan singh se mil das saal desh kii bagdor sanbhaalane ke liye pehle hi aabhaar jataa aae the
 But whenever he came to express his gratitude, no information was given to the media
 rahul kii gairmaujuudagi ke vajah kii jaankaree aaj bhi nahin he
 What did they have in their lifetime in the name of property? What are the names of inheritance, which the succeeding generations would claim? The life of Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya was dedicated to the country and education
 aazaadee kii ladaai main bhagidaari or unki khadi kii hui banaras hindu uniwarsity (biechayu) hi jindagi kaa kul saramaaya thi
 Who would claim this Sarmaya? It was everyone
 puure desh kaa tha
 He did not even live a life that would be limited to his family
 lekin aaj unke naam kii viraasat par daavedaari ko lekar pidiyon main takaraar ho rahi he
 There may have been mutual disputes in the family earlier, but it came to the surface with the announcement of giving him Bharat Ratna
 vivaad is baat ko lekar tha ki raashtrapati ke haathon yah sammaan koun grahan karegaa? parivaar kii sabase badi bahu 92 varshiya saraswati malviya ne sakvamaan par apana daawa thok diya
 Within a few days, the dispute reached the doorstep of President Pranab Mukherjee, when Saraswati Malviya wrote him a letter and brought his attention to Mahamana's will
 unhone daawa kiya ki mahaamanaa malviya ne varsh 1942 main likhe vasietname main apane sabase bade bete ramakant malviya ko hi apana uttaradhikari ghoshit kiya tha
 The following year, following the untimely death of Ramakant in 1943, his son Sridhar Malaviya was declared heir in a new will
 saraswati kaa tarktha ki ve vasietname main namit uttaradhikari kii vidhwaa hai or is naate mahaamanaa kaa bharat ratna sammaan grahan karnaa unka haq he
 Meanwhile, 98-year-old Hem Sharma, the granddaughter of Mahamana, sister of Sridhar and the oldest surviving member of the family, rejected the claim of her sister-in-law Saraswati Malaviya
 unhone kaha ki mahaamanaa malviya ke pautra giridhar malviya hi akele unki sankalpana ko aage le jane kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Therefore, they are entitled to receive this honor
 teen maheene tak jab vivaad kaa koi hal nahin niklaa to kendriya grih mantralay ne 30 march ko raashtrapati bhawan main sampann hue sammaan samaaroh main shirkat karne ke liye hem sharma, giridhar malviya, premadhar malviya or saraswati malviya ko sanyukt rup se bulaava bheja
 Saraswati Malaviya's eyes glow as soon as her ear is heard despite hearing less than her ear
 ve kahati hai, ''raashtrapati ne mere hi haath main bharat ratna diya tha
 Everybody was present there
 sab logon ne dekha ki mujhe hi mila tha
 Did not give those three
 ʼʼ ve yaheen nahin thaharatin, ''maine kaha tha ki bharat ratna pehle elahabaad laayaa jaae, jahaan ve paidaa hue the
 But something happened that Bharat Ratna was taken to BHU
 ʼʼ ve ishaaron-ishaaron main giridhar malviya par nishaanaa sadhti hai
 78-year-old Giridhar Malaviya, who has settled hundreds of cases as a judge, has kept a distance from this controversy
 ve behad sahaj andaaj main kehete hai, ''yah bahut durbhagyapurna tha, jab akhabaaron main bharat ratna grahan karne ko lekar malviya parivaar main ho rahe vivaad kii khabaren ain
 i told the government that whoever gets the honor, but kept it in BHU
 yahaan 30,000 se adhik chaatr-chatraayen hai
 All the things related to Mahamana's life are kept in the Kala Bhavan here
 ʼʼbahaanaa bhale bharat ratna rahaa ho, lekin achaanak uth khadey hue daavedaari ke is vivaad ke mul main elahabaad kaa pushtaini bangala bhi he
 The struggle of monopoly on him suddenly gave rise to the competition of the real heir of Mahamana

 There is silence in the bungalow, which is trying to rip the voices of children coming from within
 andar ghuste hi ''cretchʼʼ (shishugrih) dekhakar maajaraa samaj main aa jaataa he
 Saraswati Malaviya retired from her two daughters Ranjana Malviya and Allahabad Medical College in this bungalow
 vinaa bapat ke saath rahati hai
 Saraswati was just 25 years old when her husband Sridhar Malaviya died in 1948
 shaadi ke baad se isi ghar main raheen saraswati ne pati kii mrityu ke baad hyskool se aage kii padhai kii
 In 1981, he also opened the first crèche in Allahabad to look after young children in this bungalow
 ab unki beti ranjana cretch kii dekharekh karti hai
 The bungalow was built in 1930 by Ramakant Malaviya, the eldest son of Mahasena and Mahasena, the father of Saraswati
 ramakant rajasthan main tatkaaleen nadwara rajya main dewan the
 The dispute of claim on this bungalow has also crossed the court frame
 ramakant malviya parivaar ke kai sadasyon ne do acre se zyada jameen par faile is bangale par apni hissedari kaa daawa kar rakhaa he
 Says a senior member of the family, "the controversy related to this bungalow is at the root of the ban made by Saraswati to receive the Maha Ratna's Bharat Ratna
" iske jariye ve khud ko mahaamanaa parivaar kii asli vaaris sabit karnaa chaahati hai
 सर Saraswati appears quite uncomfortable in the ongoing tussle over the bungalow
 ve kahati hai, ''kuch log mere makaan ke peeche pade hai
 They are forgery
 hamane is makaan ko free hold karwaane ke liye ediem najul ke karyaalay main darkhwaast de rakhi he
 Controversy over Varanasi's house also arose in the family when the house of Mahamana's son Govind Malaviya was sold in front of BHU in Lanka area
 1995 main dekharekh na kar paane ke chalate jab giridhar malviya ne apane pita ke banawaye makaan ko bechney kii prakriya shuru kii to biechayu chaatro ne andolan ched diya
 The students alleged that this house was donated to Mahamana by freedom fighter fighter and Varanasi industrialist Shivprasad Gupta
 ise giradhar malviya kaise bech sakate hai? giradhar malviya kehete hai, ''mahaamanaa ne puure jivan main apane liye daan kii koi vastu sweekaari nahin thi
 These allegations were baseless
 ʼʼ haalanki mahaamanaa apane parivaar ke liye kharidi gai sampattiyon par koi vivaad nahin he
 There is also an old house in Malviya Nagar, six km south of Allahabad district headquarters, where he was born
 mahaamanaa ne apane parivaar waalon se ise kharidkar yahaan bhagwaan krishna ke mandir kii sthapana kii thi
 Now in this house, his eldest brother Lakshminarayan Malaviya's grandchildren Anand and Vivek live with their family
 is makaan kii bagal main or saamne bhi mahaamanaa ne do makaan kharide, jise unhone ramakant or gaurikant ke parivaar ko saunp diya
 Girdhar Malaviya lives in the ocher and white colored bungalow adjacent to the bungalow of Saraswati Malviya in George Town
 1911 main vakaalat chhodane se pehle mahaamanaa malviya ne teen acre main failaa yah bangala banwaaya tha
 They did two parts of it

 com / glpfqkbyos— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) May 27, 2015 However, all this happened at a time when, just before the meeting, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had launched a scathing attack on the Modi government, saying that the country's democratic institutions were threatened
 is
 enesayuai ke rashtriya adhiveshan ko sambodhit karte hue manmohan ne kaha ki desh ke saamaajik bunaavat ko lagaataar todane kii koshish kii ja rahi he or ise rokane ke liye yuvaaon ko jimmedaari uthaani hogi
 If the questions raised on policy matters are also seen, this is Manmohan Singh's biggest attack on the Modi government so far
 arthshaastra ke jaankaar manmohan ne na sirf raajnneetik aarope lagaae balki bijepi sarkaar kii aarthik nitiyon par bhi sawaal uthaae
 He said that there is a steady decline in agricultural production
 gaanvon main rahane vaali desh kii 65 fisadi aabaadi santusht nahin he
 Exports are declining
 bijepi sarkaar ke dauraan arthvyavastha main sabakuch thik nahin chal rahaa, lekin pichley ek saal main bijepi sarkaar kai aankadon or tathyon ko gadhakar yah jataane kii koshish kar rahi he ki arthvyavastha kii haalat utani kharaab nahin he
 Manmohan rejected the bjp's allegation that the UPA government was a victim of policy paralysis
 manmohan ne kaha ki unki sarkaar ke dauraan ausat salanaa vikaas dar saadhe aath fisadi thi jo ki ek record rahi
 India was the fastest growing country in the world after China
 haalanki modi or manmohan kii yah mulaakaat aise samay main bhi hui he jab khaastaur se koyala ghotaale main manmohan singh se sibiai poochtacha kar rahi he or manmohan sarkaar ko ghotaalon kii sarkaar kahkar modi sarkaar apane achche kaam bhi gina rahe hai

 yahaan tak ki trump ke maansik swasthya ko lekar bhi lagaataar sawaal uth rahe the
 Meanwhile, news came that Trump was about to undergo a mental test, but the White House has given an explanation
 white house ne mangalvaar ko kaha kidonald trumpaki is saptaah main hone vaali chikitsa jaanch main manochikitsa jaanch shaamil nahin hogi
 Let me tell you that recently, in a book by journalist Michael Wolfe, such questions have come up for discussion after some revelations
 kitaab main likhaa gaya ki trump pichley kuch dinon se apane puraane doston, puraani baton ko bhi yaad nahin rakh paa rahe hai
 The book said that Trump is repeating the same things repeatedly during his speech
 lekin trump kii manochikitsa jaanch ke sambandh main sawaal puche jane par pravaktaa hogan gidley ne ‘‘naa’’ main jawaab diya
 "he is very intelligent," Gidley told reporters in an Air Force One aircraft
 ’’ trump kii shuukravaarko walter read sainyal aspataalmen chikitsa jaanch hogi or isaki report saarvajanik kii jaaegi
 During the 2016 presidential election, the 71-year-old Trump published a letter from his doctor Harold Bornstein stating that his physical health is very good
 haal hi main prakashit patrkaar maaikel volf kii ek kitaab main unke maansik swasthya ko lekar ashankaayen jataai gai he, jisase naaraaz hokar trump ne is saptaah ke ant main tivetor par apane aap ko bahut hi sthir or hoshiyaar vyakti bataaya tha
 Trump wrote in a tweet that i have been a successful businessman, later also a top TV star and now was elected President of the country for the first time

 The Delhi High Court today dismissed a petition seeking audit of accounts of the India Against Corruption 'IAC', an anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare in 2011 and 2012
 kaaryvahak mukhya nyaayadhish gita mittal or nyaayamurti si hari shankar kii peeth ne yachikakarta chand jain ko is baat ke liye bhi fatkaar lagaai ki unhone adaalat ko yah soochna nahin di ki unhone isi tarah kii or yahi maang karne vaali ek yachika unke dwaara sanchalit gaiyr sarkari sanghathan ke naam par bhi daayar kii thi
 The High Court said during the hearing that these petitions are straightforward misuse of the process of law and it is liable to be dismissed
 kyonki yachikakarta ne isame lagaae gaye aaropon ke bare main koi vishesh jaankaree muhaiyaa nahin karai hai
 In fact, the petition alleged that the funds raised from the public were used by the members of the movement for personal gain in the agitation led by Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal
 yachika me maang kii gayi thi ki arvind kejariwal or aam aadmi party se jude jin netao ne chande kii raqam ko apane liye istemaal kiya, unke kilaaf sibiai se jaanch karwaai jaae
 The petitioner's argument was that he had also donated money in India Against Corruption, so we have the right to know whether the money was used properly or not
 lekin hycourt ne ye yachika ye kah kar kaarij kar di ki jis tarah ke aarope yachika me laagaye gaye he,uske liye yachikakarta ke paas koi saboot hi nahi he

 Political comments have started coming in after the Supreme Court's decision on the Judge Loya death case

 On Thursday, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said at a press conference that the Congress has named this decision to bring the judiciary on the road in India's politics
 congress adhyaksh rahul gandhi ko is mudde par maafee maangani chahie
 Patra said that Rahul Gandhi should not only apologize but should bow his head in shame
 unhone kaha ki supreme court ne aaj aitihaasik faisla sunaaya he
 Patra said that there was an invisible hand of the Congress behind the scandal
 unhone kaha ki court ne saaf taur par kaha he ki yachika ke peeche raajnneetik manshaa he
 He said that on 12 January, Congress Party President Rahul Gandhi held a press conference on this issue
 uske baad kapil sibbal, randeep surajevaala ne bhi is par apni baaten kahi thim
 'he (rahul Gandhi) should bow down with shame'

 com / mvw28m8ahx - Aaj Tak (@aajtak) April 19, 2018 Sambit Patra said that the Congress should apologize for the way the BJP President Amit Shah was conspired to defame him
 unhone kaha ki jis congress ne desh main apatkaal lagu kiya, vah galat aarope lagaakar pradhanmantri narendra modi or amit shah ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 He said that Rahul Gandhi does not believe in post-mortem report, judge report, police investigation, Supreme Court verdict
 rahul gandhi bas un logon par vishwaas karte hai jo bharat tere tukade honge ke naare lagaate hai
 What is the decision of the court? The Supreme Court has rejected the appeal for an independent inquiry into the matter
 court ne kaha he ki maamle kaa koi aadhaar nahin he, isliye isamen jaanch nahin hogi
 The three-judge bench pronounced the judgment saying that there is no reason to doubt the statement of four judges, doubting them would be like doubting the institute
 sheersh court ne kaha ki is maamle ke liye nyaaypalika ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii ja rahi he
 The Supreme Court reprimanded the petitioners while hearing
 supreme court ne kaha ki jin vakeelon ne ye yachika daali he, unhone iske jariye nyaaypalika ko badnaam karne kii koshish kii he
 This is like criminal contempt of court
 sheersh court ne kaha ki ye yachika raajnneetik phaayde or nyaaypalika kii prakriya par sawaal uthaane ke liye kiya gaya
 The petitioner has argued that apart from 83 percent Dalits and 71 percent normal women, 56 percent men have been affected by this law

 purv vitt sachiv shaktikant das ko bhartiya rigerv bank kaa nayaa governor niyukt kiya gaya he
 The entire world is eyeing this appointment
 duniya kaa sabase bada loktantr, doosraa sabase bada bazaar or teesri sabase badi arthvyavastha ke rigerv bank governor urjit patel ne desh kii sarkaar ke saath chal rahi swaittata kii khinchataan ke bich istipha de diya
 Given the importance of the ongoing dispute between the Reserve Bank and the government, Das has been handed over the command of the Reserve Bank to retired IAS officer Das, who is implementing major economic decisions in the country within twenty four hours
 notebandi or jiesti jaise ahm aarthik faislon ko lagu karne vaale das ko civil seva se ritairement ke baad kendra sarkaar ke vitt ayog kaa sadsy niyukt kar diya gaya tha
 Das is taking charge of the Reserve Bank at a time when the sluggish domestic economy and the global level are facing serious challenges in front of the Reserve Bank with the pull of autonomy from the Central Government
 RBI governor kii 5 chunautiyaanchunauti number-ekarektikant das ke saamne sabase badi chunauti kendiy rigerv bank kii saakh ko bachaane kii he
 Just as the previous two governors Urjit Patel and Raghuram Rajan resigned amid pulls from the central government, Das would have to ensure the autonomy of the central bank by putting an end to this pullout at the earliest
 vaishvik arthvyavastha main sabhi deshon ke kendriya bank behad ahm kirdaar nibhaate hai or apni sarkaron se swytt rahanaa inke liye adarsh sthiti he
 In such a situation, Das has to meet this challenge as RBI Governor
 khaas baat he ki maujuuda samay main das ji-20 sanghathan main kendra sarkaar ke sherpa (pratinidhitiv karne vaale) bhi hai
 Challenge number-two: The Central Reserve Bank Governor is appointed for three years
 aamtaur par vaishvik arthvyavastha main governor kii saakh ko dekhte hue kaarykaal ko badha diya jaataa he jisase kendriya bank ke governor ko 15 se 20 saal kii arthvyavastha ko sanchalit karne kaa paryaapt samay mil jaae
 While Raghuram Rajan's tenure did not extend, while Urjit Patel left for personal reasons in the middle term, Shaktikanta Das's challenge would be to set monetary policy and assess the domestic and global economic situation during his first term of three years
 Co-ordinate with the government
 chunauti number-teenshaktikant das kendra sarkaar ke arabiai main sudhaar kii jarurat par kya rukh tay karte hai
 Former governors have opposed changes in RBI by the central government
 beete kuch samay se kendriya bank ne desh main banking kshetra kii apni nitiyon ko kadaa kiya he
 Due to this, the work of taking and giving loans in front of the country's public banks has become very strict
 iskaa arthvyavastha par prabhaav dekha ja rahaa he lekin bainkon ke saamne gambhir non parforming asset (enpie) kii zyada gambhir samasya he
 Therefore, it is a big challenge for the new RBI governor to carry out policies to improve npas of banks
 chunauti number-charkendra sarkaar ke saamne mahangaai sabase bada mudda rahata he
 The central bank sets its policies while making inflation a key base
 bainkon ke byaaj daron ko badhanaa yaa ghataana desh main or vaishvik str par mahangaai kii dar ko bhi aadhaar banaakar tay kiya jaataa he
 Crude oil prices are rising once again after OPEC and Russia announced a cut in crude production globally
 jahaan beete chaar saal ke dauraan desh ko sabase badi aarthik raahat saste dar par uplabdh kaccha tel tha, kendra sarkaar or arabiai ke liye mahangaai ko kaabo rakhane kaa kaam aasaan ho gaya tha
 The key challenge is to control the inflation of the RBI on reversing the global situation
 chunauti number-panchakendra sarkaar se swaittata ke mudde par spashtataa or behatar maudrik niti ke saath-saath kendriya bank kii ahm chunauti maujuuda gharelu aarthik sthiti or vaishvik chunautiyon ko dekhte hue kis tarah se desh kii arthvyavastha ko aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Clearing the way for large investments in the country, improving the ease of doing business in the global economy and resorting to which policies to increase domestic business will be a major challenge of the central bank

 Sachin Tendulkar said that India played the match very well and India started well
 bharat ne gendbaaji or ballebaaji donon acchhee kii
 There were expectations from our team and Team India stood by that
 master blaster sachin tendulkar ke vanade cricket se sanyas lene se pakistani khilaadi bhi sakate main hai
 When the players of the Pakistan team who visited India got the news of Sachin's retirement, he could not believe it at first and then he said, "their lack will be very much in the field
 ’pakistan ke twanti-20 or vanade team ke captain mohammad hafeez ne em
 Speaking to reporters after a three-hour practice session at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, he said, "we will miss Sachin
" ’unhone kaha, ‘ek raashtra or ek khilaadi ke taur par hamen niraashaa he ki is siries se pehle sachin vanade cricket se sanyas le rahe hai kyonki unhone pakistan ke khilaaf hi apane vanade kariyar kii shuruyaat kii thi
 Not only will we remember his mastery on the entire world ground
 vah is khel ke mahaan khilaadi hai
 Fast bowler Sohail Tanvir said, 'I have enjoyed bowling a lot against him
 unke khilaaf gendbaaji karnaa itnaa mushkil rahata tha ki thodi si galati hui nahin ki ve achche se achche gend ko seemaa rekha ke paar pahunchaa dete
 The achievements he has made for India cannot be described in words
 vah cricket birdari main sabase adhik sammaan paane kaa haq rakhte hai
 Fast bowler Umar Gul said, "bowling against Sachin has always been full of challenges and getting his wicket has been enjoyable in itself because no one can read the way he reads the ball
 ’gul ne kaha, ‘bharat ko sachin par garv mahasoos karnaa chahie
 His presence alone has encouraged Indian cricket players on the field for two decades
 unhone viraat kohli, yuvaraj singh or suresh raina jaise khilaadiyon ko is mukaam par pahunchane main prerit kiya he or aane vaale dinon main or bhi khilaadi unase prerana lete rahenge

 'rock on 2' box offis par kamaal nahin dikhaa pai
 Javed Akhtar, an Indian lyricist and former Rajya Sabha MP, has said about his son's film 'rock On 2' that it would be stupid to say that 'rock On 2' could not do well at the box office due to demonetisation
 javed akhtar ne kaha,'agar main yah kahata hum ki notebandi se sirf ekfilm 'rock on2'ko prabhavit kiya he to yah bevakoofi vaala bayaan hoga

 The Aam Aadmi Party had high expectations from the MCD election
 lekin dilli kii janata ke faisle ne inpar pani pher diya he
 After the defeat in his own stronghold, now the political path has become more difficult for Arvind Kejriwal
 aapako bataate hai ye nattejey kaise badhayenge kejariwal kii mushkalen
 Will the dream of other states remain? Arvind Kejriwal and his lieutenants, at the time of their conversion to a political party from the movement against corruption, made it clear that even though they are starting from Delhi, in every state, the people of Congress and BJP Will give option 2015 ke chunaav main jeet ke baad isi masale par party main foot bhi padi
 Leaders like Yogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan were of the view that the Aam Aadmi Party should leave the ambition of expanding to other states for the time being and focus on fulfilling the promises made in Delhi
 yahi matbhed aakhir main party se unki chuttee kii vajah bane the
 After this, the Aam Aadmi Party has tried to find political land in many states including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab and Goa
 lekin emsidi chunaav main nateezon ke baad baaki rajyon main party ke graph par asar padana tay he
 People may ask that when the people of Delhi did not trust Kejriwal on local issues, then why should the people of other states seal the party's policies? After the MCD election results, party strategists will have to find the answer to this question
 vipaksh kaa cheharaa kaise banenge kejariwal?tamaam siyaasi pandit is baat par sahamat hai ki desh kii raajnneeti main philhal majboot vipaksh kii kami he
 Rahul Gandhi has failed to establish himself as a strong leader and the rest of the parties have not been able to do any special charisma outside their respective states of influence
 aise main bijepi ko chunauti dene ke liye vipakshi partiyon ko ek aise chehre kii talash he jise modi ke khilaaf janata ke saamne pesh kiya ja sake
 Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee have tried to project themselves as leaders of this line
 kejariwal ke samarthak bhi unki branding modi ke vikalp ke taur par karte rahe hai
 This is the reason why Kejriwal went to Varanasi in the last Lok Sabha elections and gave a direct fight to Modi
 aae din wo modi ko unki nitiyon or faislon par sidhi chunauti dete rahe hai
 But after this crushing defeat in his own stronghold, it is clear that Kejriwal is struggling to save his political land in Delhi itself
 aise main puure desh main modi ke vikalp ke taur par janata unhen dekhegi, isapar gaharaa shaq he
 Strategy to be changed in Delhi? When the Aam Aadmi Party was a social movement, it was taken up by the middle class
 lekin dilli kii siyaasi jameen main party ne nichle tabake ke logon ko lubhaane par jor diya
 Be it autocrats or slum dwellers, they were claimed to be at the top of the party's agenda
 aam aadmi party ko ummid thi sasti bijli, saste pani or mohalla clinics jaisi yojanaon se in tabakon ke bich uskaa janaadhar majboot hoga
 After the MCD election, now the party will have to think what policies it should adopt so that not only the lower middle class and poor class voters remain with it, but also the upper middle class, especially the youth can also trust the party again
 emsidi chunaav ke saath congress ne bhi sabit kiya he ki wo dilli main abhi lupt nahin hui he
 Therefore, the Aam Aadmi Party not only has to deal with the challenge of the BJP to save its rule in the capital of the country, but also a new strategy has to be made for the Congress' comeback
 netritv par uthenge sawaal?apane janm ke baad se hi aam aadmi party asantushton kaa saamana karti rahi he
 The process of outgoing leaders is rarely stopped
 is haar ke baad party ke bheetar daraaren or gahari ho sakati hai
 Many other leaders can catch the wind and join the BJP or Congress
 ab tak kejariwal nirvivaadit taur par aam aadmi party ke number-1 netaa rahe hai
 It is possible that after this defeat, leaders like Kumar Vishwas should question Kejriwal's leadership and ways of working within the party
 party ke netaa bhagwant maan nattejey aane ke baad party par sawaal uthaa bhi chuke hai
 Conflict with central government will increase? Arvind Kejriwal's tenure in Delhi so far has been in the limelight due to his confrontation with the central government and the LG office
 modi sarkaar ne bhi aam aadmi party kii sarkaar ko gherne kaa koi mauka nahin ganvaaya he
 After the defeat in the MCD elections, the BJP will be able to claim in more aggressive tone that the people of Delhi are no longer with Kejriwal, but with Modi
 lihaaja centre sarkaar or dilli sarkaar ke bich kashidagi badhane ke asaar hai

 Film Review: imotional drama he salmaan kii 'tubalite'central dilli ke piviar plaza me bhi din ke pehle do sho main darshakon kii koi khaas bheed nahi dekhne ko mili
 However, Salman certainly managed to make the audience reach out to see the film with his performance
 film dekhne aae kapil ne bataaya, film bahut acchhee he
 Never seen Salman in such a role before
 vahiin salmaan kii fain roshni ne bataaya, mai is film kaa kab se intjaar kar rahi thi
 The film is very emotional and i cried many times in the film
 salmaan film main ek aise kirdaar main jiskaa dimag viksit nahi ho paata, jisaki vajah se sab usko tubalite bolte hai
 Amit told, i found the film very average
 salmaan ki film thi isliye sochaa tha ki khub antertaning hogi par main bor ho gaya
 The film also liked the chemistry of real-life brothers Sohail and Salman
 tubalite se shahrukh kii tasviren li, jaadugar ke role main aae najarfirst de first sho dekhne pahunche hemanth ne bataaya, mujhe in donon kii chemistry bahut acchhee lagi
 Really, if you believe in yourself, you can achieve anything

 Chief Minister Yogi is a saffron and when the Yogi likes saffron color, then all the officers and politicians are asking why the buildings of government buildings should be made saffron
 kahin par thane kii building par bhagava rang chadh gaya he, to kahin sabji mandi or gud mandi ko bhagava rang main rang diya gaya he
 Not only this, after the recently held municipal elections, the color of the bjp-occupied municipalities has also started to become saffron
 thane ko bhagava rang main ranga gayauttar pradesh main ab thanedaar bhi sarkaar ko khush karne main jute gaye hai
 For this, instead of reducing the crime rate, these people are busy cheering the government on the pretext of saffron color
 yahi vajah he ki bijanour ke afjalgarh thane ko puri tarah sebhagava rang se rangadia gaya he
 Only the police board on the police station has remained in the police color, otherwise the entire police station building has been painted with saffron color
 thane ke andar bane ek-ek kamare ko bhagava rang se sajaa diya gaya he
 People coming to the police station are shocked to see the saffron color, as well as talking about this color in various ways
 nagar panchayat bhawanon kaa bhi bhagavakaran shuruuutar pradeshmen nagar nikaay chunaav main bijepi kii jeet ke baad ab nagar panchayat bhawanon kaa bhi bhagavakaran shuru ho gaya he
 The latest example is of the Lar Nagar Panchayat Bhawan in Deoria district, where the entire building was painted saffron within two days after the victory of bjp's presidential candidate
 yahi nahin yahaan khadi pani kii tank, tractor ko bhi rang diya gaya
 In this regard, when asked by bjp's representative and representative of bjp's Saroj Devi Jagdish Yadav, they say what a crime it was when the whole country turned to saffron
 hamaare kaaryakartaaon kii ichha or unke sahyog se chanda milakar yah kaam kiya he, jabaki navnirvaachit sabhasad kaa kahana he ki pehali baar aisa hua he
 Previously, the SP and BSP were in government, but no one had painted the building in the color of their party
 sthaneey nagarikon kaa kahana he ki bhagava hamaare desh kii samskruti kaa pratik he
 The impact on the mandi committees also did not affect the saffron color at the police stations
 iskaa asar mandi samitiyon main bhi dikhaai de rahaa he
 The Mandi committee of Najibabad in Bijnor has also been painted saffron
 mandi samiti kii puri imaarat ko bhagava rang se rang diya gaya he
 Now saffron is seen everywhere
 yahi haal bagpat ke badot kii krishi utpaadan mandi kaa bhi he
 This mandi is also painted in saffron color
 nahin diya gaya koi sarkari aadeshbaat chaahe mukhya dwaar kii ho, chaahe mandi ke board kii, sabhi bhagava rang main range hue najar aa rahe hai
 The slogans written on the walls of the mandis are also seen in saffron color
 mandi main har taraf kesaria hi kesaria rang najar aa rahaa he
 While there are 22 mandis in Meerut division, Saharanpur division has 15 mandis
 ye sabhi mandiyaan kesariyaan rang main rangi hui najar aa rahi hai
 When this was talked to Pushpraj Singh, deputy director of the State Agricultural Produce Market Council, he said that this is not a government order, but a special cleaning campaign is being carried out in the mandis under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and saffron color is a symbol of progress

 uttar pradesh vidhansabha chunaavon main pruthak bundelkhand rajya kaa mudda kitna kargar rahaa, yah chunaav ke nateezon se ujagar ho gaya
 Bundeli voters badly rejected the leaders who demanded a separate state
 ek fisadi se bhi kam bundeli matadaataaon ne pruthak bundelkhand rajya kaa samarthan kiya he
 Film actor Raja Bundela, who was ahead of the demand for a separate state, got only 1897 votes, which means it is clear
 film abhinayta or bundelkhand congress ke sansthaapak adhyaksh raja bundela ek lambe arase se bundelkhand ko ek pruthak rajya banane ke masale par yahaan kii pagarhndiyon kii khaak chaante rahe
 On this issue, he left the Congress and formed the Bundelkhand Congress and also contested the elections, but his efforts in the assembly elections proved fruitless
 raja bundela ne khud ke alaava apane navdith dal se 11 anya ummidavaaron ko bhi chunavi samar main utaara, lekin nateeja sifer rahaa
 The 12 candidates of this party, which made the separate state an electoral issue, got a total of 24 thousand 78 votes, which is less than one percent
 chunaav ke ain vakt par mayawati sarkaar dwaara vidhansabha main pradesh ko chaar rajyon main vibhajit karne kaa prastaav paarit kiye jane ke baad lag rahaa tha ki bahujan samaaj party (basapa) hi nahin, balki anya sthaneey dal va sanghathan bhi ise mudda banaaenge or bundeli matadaataaon par iskaa asar bhi hoga
 But, while the BSP itself pushed it back, organizations like the Integrated Party, Bundelkhand Navnirman Sena and Bundeli Sena shied away from contesting elections
 keval raja bundela apane 11 ummidavaaron ke saath chunaav lade or apratyaashit rup se parajeet bhi hue
 Raja Bundela got only 1897 votes from Jhansi Nagar seat, while his party contested Devraj Gupta (banda) 566, Atul Kumar (baberu) 1,364, Mahendra Pratap (tindwari) 387, DK Singh (mahoba) 772 , Swarnima Singh (rath) 768, Kishori Lal (orai) 1,426, Mohandas (madhaugarh) 1,005, Amar Singh (kalpi) 1,132, Jagpat Singh (garoutha) 388, Mukta Soni (lalitpur) 10,766 and Brijesh Kumar ( Mehroni) got only 3,657 votes
 bundela ko naraini, chitrakoot, manikpur, charkhaari, hamirpur, babina evam mauranipur seat se koi ummidavaar dhunde nahin mila
 In this way less than one percent Bundeli voters were seen supporting the separate state in the assembly elections
 raja bundela kaa kahana ki is chunaav main bundeli sattarudh dal basapa se behad khafa the, isliye vikalp ke taur par sapa va congress ke paksh main rujhaan zyada hua he
 He says that even then he is not desperate, public awareness will continue on the issue of separate state
 kal bhale hi bundeli pruthak rajya kii maang ko lekar andolan karen, par is chunaav ke nateezon se sabit he ki yahaan ke matadaata pruthak bundelkhand rajya ke liye abhi sahamat nahin hai
 The Bharatiya Janata Party has accused of connivance between the government and contractors in wheat procurement, saying that in Bundelkhand, farmers' wheat should be bought without any commission
 bundelkhand ke hamirpur jile kii bhaajapa vidhayak sadhvi niranjan jyoti ne kaha, hamirpur ke sumerpur mandi main genhu kharid par kamishankhori chal rahi he
 He said that wheat is being purchased from farmers in Bharua Sumerpur mandi for Rs 1285 and in that Rs 85 is being charged as commission from farmers
 jo kisaan kamishan de rahaa he usee kaa genhu kharida ja rahaa he
 Niranjan Jyoti said that the Chief Minister says that we will do 100 percent justice to the farmers, then why are the farmers being treated like this
 ham sarkaar se maang karte hai ki gehun kharid main ho rahi kamishankhori kaa khulaasa hona chahie or kisaanon kaa genhu bina kamishan ke kharida janaa chahie
 With regard to the Lok Sabha elections 2019, PM Modi is holding rallies to win the BJP
 reliyon ke silsile main aaj arunachal pradesh (arunachal Pradesh) piem modi (PM Modi)ne congress par jamkar hamalaa bolaa
 PM Modi called the Congress manifesto a fraud and said that Congress never fulfilled the promises
 raily main unhonekaha ki yahaan saalon tak congress kii sarkaar rahi, magar yahaan vikaas ke kaam nahin hue
 We did a lot of development work over the course of five years, but we need to do more
 piem modi ne arunachal pradesh kii raily main kaha ki itanagar or dilli main vikaas kaa dabl ingine aap sab logon ne lagaaya
 As a result of this, today Arunachal has embarked on a new path of development
 jin logon ne 70 saal se raaj kiya, ek parivaar ne 55 saal tak raaj kiya, phir bhi koi daawa nahin kar sakate hai ki unhone hindustan ke saare kaam puure kar die
 i have five years to go, i cannot claim that i have made all the claims, i am a human being to challenge every challenge
 mushkil se bhi mushkil kaam haath main lene kii taiyaari rakhane vaala insaan he
 i take my life to complete the work that i take
 congress ke ghoshnaa-patr par piem modi ne kaha ki ek taraf iraadon vaali sarkaar he or duusari taraf sirf or sirf jhuthe vaadon vaale namdaar hai
 Like these people, their manifesto is corrupt, dishonest, full of fraud
 isliye use ghoshnaptr nahin, dhakosla patr kahana chahie
 He said that winter heat, rain, whatever the weather, whatever the situation, while guarding the watchman, he also says - stay awake
 isliye aapkaa ye chaukeedaar bhi aapako jaagate raho kah rahaa he
 He is warning you of his corrupt promises
 piem modi ne kaha ki 2004 ke apane dhakoslapatr main inhone 2009 tak desh ke har ghar tak bijli pahunchane kaa vaada kiya tha
 a program was also made for this but the work was not completed
 saal 2009 main phir inkaa ek or dhakoslapatr aayaa
 Did not tell what happened to the earlier promise
 phir 2014 kaa chunaav aayaa or phir ek vaada kar daalaa ki shaharon main 100 pratishat bijli denge or gaanvon main bijli 90 pratishat tak pahunchaayenge
 Their false promises were that more than 1800 villages of Arunachal and North East and more than 3 crore families of the country were forced to live in darkness in 2014
 aapke is chaukeedaar ne hazaar din ke bheetar bijli pahunchane kaa lakshya rakhaa or hazaar din ke bheetar vaade ko puraa kiya
 PM Modi said that not only this, the Congress also made a plan to increase separatism in the country, to encourage violence, to encourage the abusers of the country
 jo tirange jhande ko jalaate hai, uskaa apmaan karte hai, jo aapaki tarah ‘jai hind' nahin, bharat tere tukade honge kaa naaraa lagaate hai, jo videshi takate haathon main khelte hai, jo hamaari viraasat kaa apmaan karte hai, jo baba sahib kii murtiyon todate hai, aise logon se bhi congress ko sahanubhuti he
 PM Modi said that on one hand your watchman, the brave son of the country, is standing against those who break the country
 desh ke bheetar ho yaa desh ke baahar, bharat maa par hamalaa karne waalon ke khilaaf aapkaa ye chaukeedaar karrwai kar rahaa he
 On the other hand, the Congress Party, which has become bankrupt in its thoughts, has reached this level today in the spasm of the return to power
 kya ye desh main algaav kii awaz ko majboot karne kii koshish nahin he? congress kaa haath desh ke saath he yaa desh ke drohiyon ke saath
 He further said that you be assured, as long as he is the watchman, those thinking about breaking the country will have to think a hundred times
 ham ek bharat, shreshth bharat ke liye jeene-marane vaale log hai
 This is the inspiration of all your colleagues in Arunachal, this is the pledge of 130 crore Indians
 pradhanmantri narendra modi ne arunachal pradesh kii chunavi raily main kaha ki arunachal pradesh main main shiksha or swasthya ko lekar anek santhaan ban rahe hai, vah aapke bharose kaa pratik he
 Because of you, we have been able to provide electricity to all the villages of Arunachal even after seven decades of independence
 har ghar ko roshan kar paae hai
 PM Modi said that we did not do big things in the name of health, yet implemented Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the world's largest health plan
 jisase muft ilaaj kii suvidha lagu hui
 Health plan is such a big plan that is the biggest plan in the world
 ek taraf wo dal jinhone kabhi desh kii aashaaon-aakankshaon ko nahin samajha, jinhone desh par raaj karne kii niyat se satta par kabja jamaaye rakhaa
 While your watchman is acting like your servant: PM Modi pakistan ke praant punjab kii rajdhani lahore main ek dharmasthal kii dekharekh karne vaale vyakti ne ek electrician par mahaj isliye paaltu sher chhod diya kyonki usne apane kaam kaa mehtaanaa maanga tha
 She has suffered several injuries in the lion attack
 pakistani media main prakashit report ke anusaar, electrician par paaltu sher chhodane kii yah harakat ek imam bargah ke prabandhak ne kii
 a case of attempt to murder has been registered against him
 yah ghatana beeti nau sitambar kii he jisamen electrician ghayal hua tha
 Police said a case of attempt to murder was registered against Imam Bargah Sadaay Hussain's manager Ali Raza after receiving a complaint two days ago
 electrician rafique ahamed ne ghatana ke fouran baad koi shikaayat darj nahin karai thi
 He said that he was forced to file a complaint against Ali Raza because Raza did not give him the money for treatment nor the work's wages as promised
 vah beete ek maheene se iske liye lagaataar raja se takada kar rahaa tha
 According to the FIR lodged in this case, Ali Raza, from electrician Rafiq, got some work done at Imam Bargah and asked to pay the wages in a few days
 iske baad raja ne rafique ke baar-baar kehane par bhi paisa nahin diya or ek din jab rafique paisa maangane pahunchaa to raja ne us par apana paaltu sher chhod diya jiske hamale main uske chehre or haath par jakhm aae
 When Rafiq shouted at the attack of the lion, the people around intervened which saved his life
 desh main loksabhaa chunaav kii bisaat abhi se bichne lagi he
 In such a situation, "aaj Tak" conducted a big survey to understand the political mood of the country
 is dauraan desh ke alag-alag hisson ke logon se unki raay jaani gai
 According to a survey conducted by KARVY Insights by India Today from 30 December 2017 to 9 January 2018, if the Lok Sabha elections are held today, the opinion of who will be the heaviest will be known
 desh ke 53% logon kaa kahana he ki pradhanmantri narendra modi behatar sabit hui he
 Apart from this, 22 percent people believe that Rahul Gandhi can be the better Prime Minister of the country
 iske alaava chaar fisadi logon ne priyanka gandhi ko behatar piem bataaya he
 However, he has not even ventured into politics
 agar kaamkaaj kii baat karen, to survey ke mutabik modi sarkaar ke kaamkaaj se 61 fisadi janata khush he
 The survey, named Mood of the Nation, covered 97 parliamentary constituencies in 19 states and 12,148 people from 194 assembly constituencies
 mamata banerjee sarvshereshth CM, chauthe par yogi adityananagar sarvshereshth mukhyamantri kii baat karen, to upar ke sheersh teen paaydaan par bijepi kaa koi bhi mukhyamantri nahin he
 UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has reached the fourth position, while 19 out of 29 states have a bjp-led government
 survey ke mutabik 12 fisadi voton ke saath trinmul pramukh mamata banerjee sarvshereshth mukhyamantri hai, jabaki 11 fisadi ke saath nitish kumaar duusare number par hai
 After this, Arvind Kejriwal is at the third position with nine percent
 iske alaava yogi adityanath nau fisadi ke saath chauthe sthaan par hai
 However, in terms of statistics, Kejriwal and Yogi Adityanath are equal, ie both have a tieup in the third place
 sarvshereshth mukhyamantri kii suchi main sheersh par kabiz mamata banerjee pashchim bengal kii mukhyamantri hai, jabaki nitish kumaar bihar ke mukhyamantri hai
 Kejriwal is the Chief Minister of Delhi, while Yogi Adityanath is the Chief Minister of UP
 bispi or sapa ke congress ke saath aane se bad jayega UPA kaa kunbasrwey ko dhyaan main rakhkar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki agar vipaksh yani congress, tiemasi, bispi or espi ekajute ho jaaen, to upie ke khate main 38 fisadi vot aa jaaenge
 This means that the difference of vote between the NDA and UPA will be two per cent
 isi tarah agar congress ke saath tiemasi, bispi or espi aa jaaen, to upi ke khate main 202 siten aa sakati hai, jabaki endie ke khate main mahaj 258 siten or anya ke khate main 83 siten aaengiaj chunaav hue, to NDA ko 309 or UPA ko 102 siton par milegi jeetbihar ke mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ke endie main shaamil hone ke baad kiye gaye is survey ke mutabik agar aaj loksabhaa chunaav hote hai, to endie ko 40 fisadi, upie ko 27 fisadi or anya ko 33 fisadi vot milenge
 However, in a survey conducted earlier, the NDA was said to get 42 per cent of the votes, which means that the popularity of NDA has declined by two per cent in this survey
 agar chunaav hote hai, to NDA ko 309 siton, UPA ko 102 or anya ko 132 siton par jeet milegi
 NDA seat has declined this time as compared to previous survey
 pichley survey main endie ko 349 or upie ko 75 siten milane kii baat kahi gai thi
 Unemployment is the biggest issue, according to the survey people still consider inflation as the biggest issue
 29 fisadi logon kaa kahana he ki berogari sabase badi chunauti he, jabaki 23 fisadi log mahangaai ko sabase bada mudda maanate hai
 Apart from this, 17 percent people consider corruption as the biggest issue

 17 percent of the people say that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is the biggest achievement of the Modi government
 itane hi fisadi logon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki kaledhan ke khilaaf abhiyaan main modi sarkaar safal rahi he
 14 per cent people described the Modi government as corruption free government
 iske saath hi 14 fisadi logon ne notebandi or 11 fisadi logon ne GST ko lagu karne ko modi sarkaar kii badi uplabdhi bataaya

 iske alaava 18 fisadi logon ne nitin gadakari ko behatar mantri bataaya he
 The popularity gap between Modi and Rahul decreased by 24% after the Gujarat elections
 Congress President Rahul Gandhi's popularity has increased tremendously after the Gujarat elections
 is dauraan narendra modi or rahul gandhi kii lokapriyata kaa antar 24 fisadi kam hua he
 The survey also revealed that even today, Indira Gandhi is the most popular leader in South India and Muslim dominated areas
 is dauraan modi sarkaar par jamkar nishaanaa sadhate hue yogendra yadav ne kaha ki piem modi kii lokapriyata ghati he
 Modi is not going to win the election only on the basis of clean India
 mahangaai or kisaan aatmahatya rokane main vifal rahi modi sarkarasrve main logon ne manhagaai, kisaan aatmahatya, seemaa paar aatankwaad par bhi modi sarkaar kii safalataa or vifaltaa par apni raay rakhi

 In the politics of Uttar Pradesh, new political equations are seen forming these days
 shivpal yadavasapa se bagavaat kar samaajawaadee secular morcha kaa gathan kar use majboot karne main lage hai
 After Shivpal, now independent MLA from Kunda Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiyain has also made a move towards forming his political party
 raja bhaiya 30 november ko lakhanu main hone vaali raily main apni nai party kaa naam or padaadhikariyon kaa elaan kar sakate hai
 He named his party 'jansatta Party'
 mana ja rahaa he ki raghuraaj pratap singh apni party kaa gathan karke loksabhaa chunaav 2019 main apane ummidavaar khadey kar sakate hai
 Raja Bhaiya's original base outside of Kunda is in the Rajput (kshatriya) society
 uttar pradesh main kareeb 7 fisadi rajput samaaj he
 In the current politics, the Rajput community stands firmly with the BJP under the leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in the state
 2017 ke upi vidhansabha chunaav main 63 rajput vidhayak jeetne main safal rahe the
 Of these, 57 came from BJP, 2 Congress, 2 BSP, 1 SP, 1 won independently
 inamen nurpur se lokentre chouhan kaa nidhan ho gaya he
 In this way, BJP has 56 and a total of 62 mlas
 raja bhaiya raajnneetik dal banaakar 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main utarate hai, to bijepi ke liye hi musiibat ban sakate hai
 However, if sources are to be believed, instead of fighting against the BJP, they can join hands and enter the electoral battlefield
 upi ke rajyasabha chunaav main bijepi ummidavaar ke paksh main vot dene ke chalate sapa adhyaksh akhileshyadavase unke rishte bighad gaye hai
 At the same time, the proximity of Raja Bhaiya is also big with Yogi Adityanath
 aise main bijepi ke khilaaf utarane kii sambhawana bahut kam he
 Shivpal Yadav entered the politics by holding the finger of his elder brother SP mentor Mulayam Singh Yadav
 lekin akhilesh yadav se unke rishte ek kadar bigade ki unhone sapa se baghawat kar alag siyaasi raah par chalane kaa faisla kiya he
 Under this, he has formed his new party
 shivpal ab apane raajnneetik vajood ko soobe main sthapit karne main jute gaye hai
 In such a situation, he is eyeing the sp's original bank muslim-yadav
 secular morcha sapa ke ruthe netaaon kaa thikaana banataa ja rahaa he
 There is also a continuing trend of Yadav and Muslim leaders joining with Shivpal
 bataa den ki upi main 20 fisadi muslim or 12 fisadi yadav matadaata sapa kaa mul vot bank mana jaataa he
 On the basis of votebank of both these communities, Mulayam Singh Yadav to Akhilesh Yadav rose to the throne of power
 ab is votbank ko shivpal yadav apane saath jodne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Shivpal has decided to field all 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections
 iske liye wo kuch kshetreey dalon ko bhi apane saath mila rahe hai
 In such a situation, Shivpal seems to be making the biggest trouble for Akhilesh
 little master sunil gavaskar kaa maananaa he ki bharat kii captaini ke liye dhoni hi sarvshereshth vikalp he or bisisiai ko unka vikalp talashne ke liye abhi intjaar karnaa chaiye

 'he said,' i think he is still the best choice for captaincy

 Mahi herself has spoken till 2013 and by then we will get a better picture
 ’yah poochne par ki kya bharat ko teen praaroop main teen captainon kii jarurat he, gavaskar ne kaha, ‘yadi ek hi captain teenon praaroop main he to isse behatar kuch nahin ho saktaa kyonki isse kaman bikharegi nahin
 Asked if the Test series defeat would be forgotten after a good one-day performance, he said, "I don't think so
 har team or khilaadi kaa akalan test cricket main uske pradarshan ke aadhaar par hota he
 Test wins are of paramount importance for real cricket lovers
 ’ The first day of the three-day warm-up match against Mumbai was very rewarding for the New Zealand team, but the scorching heat of Delhi left the Kiwi team sweat

 After the first day's play was over, Letham said that he has not batted in such a heat in his career and the sooner his team gets used to playing in India's heat, the better it will be for the team
