 team india lucky, uske paas viraat-dhoni hanashish nehra ne team india ke maujuuda dressing room main mahendra singh dhoni or viraat kohli kii maujuudagi par apni raay rakhi
 He said, 'virat and Dhoni's presence in the dressing room is very important
 team india bhaagyashaalee he ki uske paas ye do hai
 Dhoni's experience is especially useful for the youth
 is team main dam he ki vah bharat se baahar bhi acha kar paaegi
 Virat's thinking is taking the team forward
 On the spirit of Virat, he said, "cheerful aggressive Virat's nature is such that if he scored two centuries in two matches, it does not mean that he will rest after that, he will be in the third match
 i also have the passion to score a century
 yah jaruri nahin ki aisa har match main ho saktaa he, lekin unki aisi soch bahut acchhee baat he
 Virat is leading the rest of the young players of the team in the same manner

 Nehra made an interesting comparison to Sourav Ganguly and Mahendra Singh Dhoni on the question of which captain was the best handle, who understood both his game and body
 unhone kaha, 'maine sabase zyada cricket saurav ganguli kii captaini main khelaa
 At that time we did not even care about our injury
 lekin baad main mahasoos kiya ki enjuri ke baad bhi khelkar maine apni chot ko or badha liya
 Later too i continued to have trouble, but kept 'managing' it
 nehra ne kaha, 'mahendra singh dhoni alag tarah ke captain the
 He knew how to get his 'best' out of the player
 vah mujhase hameshaa bolte kabhi bhi aisa lage ki aap game ke liye feet nahin ho, to mujhe bataa dena, koi problem nahin, rest kar lenaa
 Dada used to say, "come on, you will play, don't worry
" ' virendra sahvaag, jo team india ke liye zyada captaini nahin kii, wo bade zyada positive captain the
 Regarding current captain Virat Kohli, connecting Virat and Imran Khan to each other, Nehra said, 'virat has a different way as a captain
 jitne bhi nae players hai, chaahe hon yajuvendra chahal, keel rahul hon yaa akshar patel- sabhi ko is tarah kaa confidence de rahe hai ki siries main 2-0 kii badhat he to 3-0 ke bare main sochen
 Virat does not just say, he also executes it himself
 pakistan main apane jamaane main imran khan bhi aisa hi karte the
 He did not say to anyone that you hit ten rounds, first you used to hit so many rounds, then you used to say to others that you also take 4-5 rounds

 Now if someone wants a PAN, one has to use Aadhaar first, make a PAN and then start using it
 aadhaar ke saath laabh yah hoga ki use pan srujit karne kii jarurat nahin he
 So, this is a big feature
 ' yah puche jane par ki kya bank khate main 50,000 rupee se adhik jamaa karne yaa nikasi ke liye pan kii jagah aadhaar kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, pandey ne kaha, ‘aap vahaan aadhaar kaa upyog kar sakate hai

 Asked if the PAN would be phased out, he said this would not be the case as people have the option of using a permanent account number or Aadhaar
 pandey ne kaha, ‘‘kuch logon ko pan ke upyog main koi samasya nahin he
 
 
 That is why both PAN and Aadhaar will remain because some people may prefer the use of Aadhaar, while some may prefer the use of PAN

 analophul activities privansion act (UAPA) main sanshodhan se judaa bill aaj loksabhaa main paas ho gaya
 Congress voted out of the House before voting on the bill
 charchaa ke dauraan grih mantri amit shah ne vipaksh par joardaar hamalaa kiya
 Responding to the discussion, Home Minister Shah said that today is the need of the hour that a Sankh law should be enacted against terrorism
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kanoon ke dil main urban naksaliyon ke liye koi dayaa nahin he
 Amit Shah said that there is a provision in the NIA Act to declare any organization involved in terrorist activity as a terrorist organization, but the NIA did not have the authority to declare those who carried out the terrorist acts or who were plotting it
 grahamantri ne iskaa udhaaharan dete hue kaha ki NIA ne yaccin bhatkal ke sanghathan indian mujahiddeen ko aatankwaadi sanghathan ghoshit kiya tha, lekin use aatankwaadi ghoshit nahin kiya
 Taking advantage of this, he carried out 12 terrorist incidents
 urban naksaliyon ko lekar unhone kaha ki saamaajik jivan main desh ke liye kaam karne vaale bahut log hai, lekin urban maoism ke liye jo kaam karte hai unke liye hamaare dil main bilkul bhi samvednaa nahin he
 Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Lok Sabha: In this country, a lot of people involved in social work are working respectably, police is not fond of catching them, but we don't have any sympathy for those who work for Urban Maoism

 For this reason, it is necessary to bring a provision to declare a person as a terrorist
 unhone is dauraan america, yuan, china, isroyal or pakistan jaise deshon kaa bhi udhaaharan diya
 Home Min Amit Shah in LS on Unlawful Activities (prevention) Amendment Act Bill: There's a need for a provision to declare an individual as a terrorist, UN has a procedure for it, US has it, Pakistan has it, China has it, Israel has it, European Union has it, everyone has done it pic

 com / ljmsbfe6l5 In the Lok Sabha, Shah said that this law was brought by the government of Indira Gandhi, we are just making small amendments in it
 lekin vipaksh ke jo netaa iskaa virodh kar rahe hai, unhen yaad rakhana chahie ki jab unhone is bill main sanshodhan kiya tha wo bhi sahi tha or aaj jo ham kar rahe hai wo bhi sahi he
 Home Minister Amit Shah in LS on Unlawful Activities (prevention) Amendment Act Bill: When you question us you don't see who brought the law & amendments, who made it stringent
 It was brought when you were in power, what you did then was right & what I'm doing now is also right

 com / 1z8gktome2 On the question of misuse of law, the Home Minister said that the bill contains provisions as to when a person will be declared a terrorist
 unhone kaha ki aatankwaad bandook se nahin balki prachaar or unmaad se paidaa hota he
 Why is anyone objecting in declaring those doing this as terrorists? amit shah bole ki vipaksh kah rahaa he ki sarkaar iske jariye kisi bhi computer main ghus jaaegi, agar aatankwaad se judaa kaam karoge to police aapke computer main jarur ghusegi

 In this meeting Kuldeep Nayar, Arun Shourie, HK Dua, Drs
 pranay roy samet kai bade patrkaar jute
 Many legalists, including Fali Nariman, also became part of this discussion
 padhein is maukey par kisne kya kaha
 
 
 NDTV co-founder Dr
 pranay roy ne kaha, mujhe ye karnaa bilkul bhi acha nahin lag rahaa
 We are thankful to these great personalities today
 ham inaki chaaya main badhate hai
 Once i went to China, there i was asked, don't you feel a little irritated seeing our skyscrapers? i said, we have the best skyscrapers - free atmosphere
 yah khokhla maamla keval enditivi ke khilaaf nahin he
 Rather it is a sign for all of us
 'ham aapako dabaa sakate hai, bhale hi aapane kuch na kiya ho
 'freedom of the press is the best thing for India
 unka sandesh he, 'ghutanon ke bal chalo yaa phir ham tumhen jhukaa denge
 i say - stand in front of them, and they will never be able to do that
 ' ham kisi agency ke khilaaf nahin lard rahe
 They are Indian institutions, but we are against those leaders who are using them wrongly
 adhikariyon ne hamen bataaya ki unhen kyon aisa karnaa padaa
 Our fight is not against Sanjay Dutt either
 vah bhi ek aisa shaks he, jise mohara banaaya gaya he or jiskaa istemaal kiya gaya
 He said, 'sanjay Dutt's mother is a wonderful person
 unhone sanjay dutt samet ham paanch logon ko bulaayaa
 He said, 'son, these are good people
 tumne galati kii he, use sudhaaro
 When i pray, i pray more for you, not for you
 ' netaa bina aag ke bhi dhuaan paidaa kar sakate hai
 Speaking on the GE money laundering case, he said, 'I am ashamed that our leaders can make such allegations
 ' ham sabhi aaropon kaa jawaab denge
 All we want is a deadline set
 teen saal main sarkaar ne 21 baar sthagan kii maang kii
 He said, 'I or Radhika have not kept even one rupee of black money
 hamane kabhi kisi ko rishwat nahin di he
 ' varisht patrkaar rajdeep saradesai ne kaha, 'mujhe lagata he ki vartmaan maahaul main chup rahanaa koi vikalp nahin he
 This is the moment when we have to stand on the right edge in history
 rajyasabha ke purv sadsy or varisht patrkaar echke dua ne kaha, 'pichhali dfa press ke zyaadaatar log khadey nahin hue the or jaisaa ki adwani ne kaha tha, wo reng rahe the
 After that came the Contempt Bill
 ham ikattha hue hai, yah ek rashtriya andolan ban jayega
 Rajiv Gandhi wanted to talk, but we refused
 press kii ekta ne ladaai jeet lee thi
 The bill had to be withdrawn because people were against it
 vaise hi sanket ab bhi dikh rahe hai
 If we are united, we can repeat it again
 prakhyat nyayavid fali nariman ne kaha, freedom after spich hi sahi myne main freedom of spich he
 No one can escape a trial in criminal cases, but the way it was done, i think it is an attack on the freedom of the press and the media
 2 june ko sibiai ne 7 saal pehle hui baat ke liye exiaar darj kii
 Without any investigation and only on the basis of information given by a person named Sanjay Dutt
 shikaayat main yah nahin likhaa gaya is maamle ko pehle saamne kyon nahin laayaa gaya
 The CBI also did not try to know this
 pehali cheez jo sibiai ko kerani chahie thi, jab aisa koi maamla daayar kiya gaya, to enditivi kii pratikriya leni chahie thi, lekin aisa nahin kiya gaya
 When a government agency files a complaint against a media company, it is important to know what the owners of the company have to say before conducting a raid
 yah koi samarthan or krupa kaa maamla nahin he balki sanvaidhanik kartavya kaa maamla he
 He said, 'it is also necessary to pay attention to the events before the raid
 1 june ko jab sanjay hajarika enditivi ke sho main bol rahe the, tab sambit paatra ne bich main tokate or kaha : main keval enditivi par logon ko toktaa hum or aisa main isliye karata hum kyonki enditivi kaa ek agenda he
 It was only after Patra was charged that ndtv's office and ndtv's co-founder, Dr
 pranay roy awaas par chaape pade
 There were similar attacks on the media during Indira Gandhi
 
 
 tab indian express ke khilaaf ritern nahin file karne ke 120 maamle darj karaae gaye the, lekin supreme court main antat: hamaari jeet hui
 Former Union Minister Arun Shourie said, 'I thank Narendra Modi wholeheartedly
 unhone itane saare mitron ko saath laa diya
 i have a couplet for them: He who sat on this throne before you, was also convinced that he was God
 pehle unhone vigyapanon jaise protsaahan die, phir dar kaa ye maahaul
 And now they are using a third instrument to exert pressure
 unhone NDTV ko ek udhaaharan bana diya he
 Due to the nature of the rule, it will become more fierce in the coming months
 maujuuda sarkaar sarvasattavadi he
 Anyone who tried to put their hands on the press in India burned their hands
 enditivi dwaara die gaye tathyon kaa sibiai jawaab tak nahin de paa rahi he
 There is even an article in The Wire
 tathy akatya hai
 You must help your friend, as they will try to divide you
 keval yantra na bane
 There is nothing more discouraging than not supporting peers
 ye maine civil seva main dekha he
 i complain to my press colleagues that we should not be as cautious as we should have been
 yah bahut dukhad he ki artiai kaa galaa ghonte jane ke samay hamen jaisi pratikriya kerani chahie thi, hamane nahin kii
 Raj (kamal Jha) told me that almost all the RTI applications filed by Indian Express were rejected these days
 keval apil ke str par unhen pahunch milti he
 Arun Puri, editor-in-chief of India Today Group said, i firmly say that freedom of media cannot be taken away in a democracy
 unhone kaha ki aisa kadam bolne kii aazaadee ke siddhant ko bhi kamjor karata he
 Senior journalist Kuldeep Nayar said, "during the Emergency, no one had to tell anyone what to do
" sabhi jaanate the ki kya karnaa he
 The Indian Express then became a symbol
 aaj, jab ham kamobesh waisi hi sthiti kaa saamana kar rahe hai, haalanki us str kaa nahin, ham sabhi ko yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki ham kisi ko bhi bolne kii aazaadee chhinane naa den
 The comments varisht patrkaar shekhar gupta ne kaha, 'yah wo samay he jab hamen apane sanghathanaatmak or sansthagat sambhddhata ko bhoolanaa hoga
 This is the issue of Azad Press which is connected with all our institutions
 yah press kii aazaadee par hamalaa he
 Please stop whipping yourself
 soshal media ne ham sabko gumraah kar diya he
 There are far better people in journalism than other professions
 koi bhi prestitute nahin he
 Do not be afraid of a storm of abuse
 ' unhone kaha, 'jab indian express ke khilaaf badi sankhya main cese darj kiye gaye the tab ramnath goyanka kii un maamalon ko lekar pratikriya thi, 'isse kya fark padataa he? hamane katl ke alaava saare kanoon tode hai
 'he said,' i hope NDTV will continue to do what it is doing
 hamaara kaam he satta se sach bolnaa he
 Many of us have become megaphones of power
 ' Senior journalist Om Thanvi said, the media needs to be one
 enditivi ke sah sansthaapak dow
 Prannoy Roy said, i do not like doing this at all
 ham aaj in mahanubhaavon kii mehabaani se hai
 We grow in their shadow
 ek baar main china gaya, vahaan mujhase poocha gaya kya aapako hamaari gaganchumbi imaaraten (skyscrapers) dekhakar thodi jalan nahin hoti? maine kaha, hamaare paas sarvshereshth skyscrapers hai- aaazaad maahaul
 This hollow case is not only against NDTV
 balki yah ham sab ke liye ek sanket he
 'we can suppress you, even if you have done nothing
 ' press kii aazaadee bharat ke liye sarvshereshth baat he
 His message is, 'walk on your knees or we will bend you
 main kahata hum - unke saamne khadey ho jaao, or wo kabhi aisa nahin kar paaenge
 'we are not fighting against any agency
 wo bharat kii sansthaaen hai, lekin ham un netaaon ke khilaaf hai jo inkaa galat istemaal kar rahe hai
 The officials told us why they had to do so
 hamaari ladaai sanjay dutt ke khilaaf bhi nahin he
 He is also a man who has been made and used
 unhone kaha, 'sanjay dutt kii maa behtareen insaan hai
 He called five of us, including Sanjay Dutt
 unhone kaha, 'betaa, ye achche log hai
 You have made a mistake, correct it
 jab main prarthana karti hum, to tumhaare nahin, balki inke liye zyada karti hum
 'leaders can produce smoke even without fire
 jeei mani laundring maamle par bolte hue unhone kaha, 'main sharminda hum ki hamaare netaa aisa aarope laga sakate hai
 'we will answer all allegations
 ham bas itnaa chaahate hai ki samaysima tay ho
 The government has sought adjournment 21 times in three years
 unhone kaha, 'maine yaa radhika ne ek rupaya bhi kaala paisa nahin rakhaa he
 We have never given any relationship
 ' Senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai said, 'I think in the current environment, keeping quiet is not an option
 yah wo kshan he jab hamen itihaas main sahi kinare par khadaa hona hoga
 Former Rajya Sabha member and senior journalist HK Dua said, 'last time most of the press people were not standing and as Advani said, they were crawling
 uske baad avmaananaa vidheyak aayaa
 We have gathered, it will become a national movement
 rajeev gandhi baat karnaa chaahate the, lekin hamane inkaar kar diya
 The unity of the press had won the battle
 vidheyak waapas lenaa padaa, kyonki log uske khilaaf the
 The same signs are still visible
 agar ham ekajute hon to ham phir se use doharaa sakate hai
 Eminent jurist Fali Nariman said, "freedom after speech is truly freedom of speech
" aapraadhik maamalon main koi bhi mukademe se batch nahin saktaa, lekin jis tarah se yah kiya gaya, usase mujhe lagata he yah press or media kii aazaadee par hamalaa hai
 On June 2, the CBI registered an FIR for what happened 7 years ago
 bina kisi jaanch ke or keval sanjay dutt naam ke ek shaks dwaara di gai soochna ke aadhaar par
 It was not written in the complaint why this matter was not brought before
 sibiai ne bhi yah jaanane kii koshish nahin kii
 The first thing the CBI should have done was take ndtv's response when such a case was filed, but it was not done
 jab koi sarkari agency kisi media company ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karti he, to yah jaruri he ki chaape maarane se pehle yah janaa jaae ki company ke maalikon kaa is bare main kya kahana he
 It is not a matter of support and kindness but a matter of constitutional duty
 unhone kaha, 'chaape kii karrwai se pehle kii ghatnaon par dhyaan dena bhi jaruri he
 On 1 June, when Sanjay Hazarika was speaking on the NDTV show, Sambit Patra interrupted and said: i only interrupt people on NDTV and i do this because NDTV has an agenda
 paatra ke aarope lagaae jane ke baad hi enditivi ke daftar or enditivi ke sah sansthaapak dow
 Pranay Roy raided the residence
 indira gandhi ke samay bhi media par aise hi hamale hue the
 
 
 At that time 120 cases were filed against Indian Express for not filing returns, but in the Supreme Court we finally won
 purv kendriya mantri arun shouri ne kaha, 'main narendra modi kaa tahe dil se shukriya adaa karata hum
 He brought so many friends with him
 mere paas unke liye ek doha he : wo jo aapse pehle is singhaasana par baitha tha, use bhi yahi yakeen tha ki vah khuda he
 First he encouraged the advertisements, then this atmosphere of fear
 or ab wo dabaav daalane ke liye tisare saadhan kaa upyog kar rahe hai
 He has made NDTV an example
 hukumat kii prakruti kii vajah se yah aane vaale maheenon main or bhi zyada ugr hoga
 The current government is totalitarian
 jis kisi ne bhi bharat main press par haath daalane kii koshish kii, wo apane haath jala baitha
 The CBI is not even able to respond to the facts given by NDTV
 yahaan tak ki da vir main ek aalekh bhi he
 Facts are irrefutable
 aapako apane mitra kii madad kerani hi chahie, kyonki wo aapako baantne kikoshish karenge
 Don't just be a machine
 saathiyon kaa samarthan nahin karne se zyada hatotsahit karne vaali baat koi or nahin hoti
 i have seen this in the civil service
 meri apane press ke sahyogiyon se shikaayat he ki ham utane satark nahin rahen, jitna hamen rahanaa chahie tha
 It is very sad that we should not react the way RTI was strangled us
 raaj (camel jha) ne mujhase kaha tha ki in dinon indian express dwaara daayar kiye lagbhag sabhi artiai aavedan ko khaarij kar diya gaya
 They have access only at the level of appeal
 india today group ke editor in chif arun puri ne kaha, meraa dridhtaapurvak kahana he ki loktantr main media kii swatantraaa ko chhina nahin ja saktaa
 He said that such a step also undermines the principle of freedom of speech
 varisht patrkaar kuldeep naiyar ne kaha, apatkaal ke dauraan kisi ko kisi se ye nahin kahana padataa tha ki kya karnaa he
 Everyone knew what to do
 tab indian express ek pratik ban gaya tha
 Today, when we are facing more or less the same situation, though not of that level, we all have to make sure that we do not let anyone take away the freedom to speak
 tippaniyan Senior journalist Shekhar Gupta said, 'this is the time when we have to forget our organizational and institutional affiliation
 aaazaad press kaa yah wo mudda he jo hamaare sabhi sansthaanon se judaa he
 It is an attack on freedom of the press
 kripaya khud ko kode maarna band kiijie
 Social media has misled us all
 anya peshon kii tulana main patrakarita main kahin behatar log hen
 There is no prestitute

 He said, "when a large number of cases were filed against the Indian Express, then Ramnath Goenka's response to those cases was," What difference does it make? We have broken all laws except murder
 ' unhone kaha, 'mujhe ummid he ki enditivi vahi karata rahegaa jo wo kar rahaa he

 Former England captain Mike Brearley believes the current captain of the team, who is not a great batsman like Root Virat Kohli but is a 'sensible player' who needs to turn a good start into a big score like his Indian rival
 brairali ne kaha, ‘kohli kii tulana main root kii acchhee shuruyaat ko bade score main badalane kii dar kam he, lekin mujhe lagata he ki root bhi achche ballebaaj he or main use acha karnaa dekhnaa chahta hum
 "he is a fantastic batsman and very intelligent," said Brearley
 vah kohli kii tarah acha ballebaaj nahin he lekin sochane samajhane vaala khilaadi he
 Brearley described Kohli as the best batsman in the world and said it was due to his aggression
 kohli ne pehle test main 149 or 51 ran kii pari kheli lekin bhartiya team is kareebi mukaable ko 31 ran se haar gai
 Brearley, however, praised Kohli for reaching the top of the ICC Test rankings
 is khilaadi ne team india se chhini thi jeet, ab duusare test se honge bahraunhone kaha, ‘mujhe lagata he ki kohli duniya kaa sarvshereshth ballebaaj hai or jis ballebaaj kaa ausat teenon praaroop main 50 se zyada kaa he vah shandaar khilaadi hoga
 He can play under any circumstances
 root bhi aisa hi he lekin jo baat kohli ko alag banaati he vah he ardhashatak ko shatak main badalane kii kaabiliyat
 'brearley said' Any defeat hurts but Kohli will learn a lot from this defeat
 kohli ke liye test kii yah haar seekhney vaali hogi
 This will make things easier for them (as now the expectations from the team will be lower)
 is bhartiya team main haar naa maanane kaa jajba he khaskar unki gendbaaji akraman main, or mujhe lagata he aisa kohli ke netritv ke kaaran he

 The report says that the US provided India with photographic coverage of the border area for two reasons
 'sabase pehla kaaran tha ki america niti nirmaataa vivaadit kshetra kii spasht tasviir chaahate the

 If everything goes well, the film will be released on January 12 next year
 haalanki mekars ne relies date badhaane kii baton se inkaar kiya he
 However, the film has not yet received certification from the censor board
 film ko certification ke liye 17 november ko sensor ke paas bheja gaya
 Sources also say that the censor board has returned the film
 film kaa rivyuu nahin kiya gaya he
 Demonstrations are being held across the country to prevent Padmavati from releasing

 bavaal kaa asar: puure dedh maheene let hui padmavati, ab 12 janvari ko hogi relies?1
 After Gujarat elections, the matter will cool down
 Now elections are going on in Gujarat
 iske kaaran rajasthan, madhya pradesh se sate ilaakon main bhi yah vivaad teji se fail rahaa he
 The result of the Gujarat assembly elections will come on December 18, after which the political parties' interest in this matter may be reduced to a large extent

 The people of the Rajput community objected to the film

 During the filming of 2008, there was an attempt to ban the release of the film in Rajasthan and Gujarat
 us vakt bhi rajput sabha ne virodh kiya tha
 jodha-akbar's relationship was questioned
 us dauraan bhi rajput karani sena ne bhi nirdeshak ashutosh goarikar ko nishaanaa banaaya tha
 Eventually the film was not released in Rajasthan
 aise main bhansaali bhi maamla shant hone kaa intjaar kar film relies kar sakate hai
 Not just protests, these are also the reasons why the release of Padmavati? 3
 christmas ke baad khaali rahegaa box offischristmas or new year par bollywood main kai filmein relies hone vaali hai
 In such a situation, if Bhansali can wait for January 2018, then he can remain in profit
 janvari main koi badi film pehle se relies ke liye shedul nahin he
 Because Fukrey Returns is coming on 15 December
 iske baad 22 disambar ko salmaan khan or katrina caff kii tiger jinda he relies honi he
 In such a situation, Bhansali will not get a chance to release the film during this period
 wo salmaan ke saath nahin takaraana chahenge
 At the same time, Akshay Kumar's Padman is scheduled to be released on January 25
 usase pehle kisi bhi bade star kii film line main nahin he
 Bhansali can take advantage of middle dates

 Bhansalisanjay Leela Bhansali has already been insured for this film
 film se hone vaale nuksaan se bhaybheet hai
 As per the Bombay Times report, the film has been insured
 ek unit member ke anusaar, ye kul 160 karod rupye kaa he
 Under this insurance policy, if there is a protest during the ticket sale after the release of Padmavati, or there is a dispute, strike and sabotage, the loss will be repaid
 5
 Waiting for the atmosphere to cool, the atmosphere is hot at the moment
 rajasthan main shooting ke dauraan bhansaali par hamale tak hue the
 After that there was a furore on the sets in Maharashtra
 iske baad se hi maamla garmaya hua he
 There is controversy again as soon as the release comes closer
 ho saktaa he ki maamla court main jane ke baad koi faisla aa jaae
 Waiting for a decision on the film's release can calm the matter

 Superintendent of Police Das told that two people reached the church on Sunday evening and said to pray there
 carch main pravesh karne ke baad unhone padri or unki patni par hamalaa kar diya or vahaan rakhe saamaan main aag laga di
 The Superintendent of Police said that the police team was sent to the church as soon as the incident was received
 police ne aropiyon ke khilaaf bhartiya dand samhita kii dhara 295, 392, 452, 435, 323 or 34 ke tahat maamla darj kar liya he
 The search for the accused continues
 likhaa hua padhane or bina likhaa hua bolne ke dauraan netaaon kaa vyaktitv bahut badal jaataa he
 This is the time when you can see a person in two different mental frames
 likhaa hua bhaashan acha hote hue bhi netaa kii dehbhasha ko baandh detaa he
 Sometimes a written speech or statement is necessary, but every time you read a written speech, it is not fun either
 jamaane se mayawati ko tivi par likhaa hua bhaashan padhate hue dekh rahaa hum
 This thing was not worth her
 buudhvaar ko jab unki party ke puraane netaa swami prasad maury ne istifa diya to soochna ai ki mayawati bhi press conference karengi
 i thought she would bring a ten-line statement again and go away reading it
 lekin aisa nahin hua
 Mayawati came and did not bring anything written
 thodi der pehle hi maine apane ek mitra se kaha tha ki basapa main media ke liye koi pravaktaa to he nahin or mayawati aaengi bhi to parchaa padhakar chali jaaengi
 But Mayawati stood in the big door and started speaking
 panne kaa kavach hataaya lekin darvaaze kii oot nahin hataa sakin
 Every leader is insecure in his own way
 kair mayawati jaldi hi ron main aa gayi
 She soon became free from pages and pamphlets, feeling that i am seeing another Mayawati
 jab netaa aatmavishvaas se bharaa hota he to samvaad par uski pakad gazab kii hoti he
 The process of alertness and fluency creates more confidence when he contemplates and speaks
 aisa lagata he vah raajnneeti ko jeeta he or jo jeeta he vahi bol rahaa he
 The news of the BSP general secretary leaving the party also shocked the cadre of the party
 basapa kaa kader mayawati ko bhi dekh rahaa he ki vah is chunaav main kaisaa karti hai
 In his mind, the movement of Kanshi Ram's stand is worried
 mayawati maury par hamale karne se zyaada apane us kader ko bhi sambodhit kar rahi thim jise movement kaa aadmi kaha jaataa he
 This section is worried about the BSP reaching zero in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections
 vah upi chunaav ke liye ji jaan se juta hua he lekin ab uski aankh sirf zamin par nahin rahati, aasmaan par bhi rahati he jahaan uskaa netritv baithta he
 Speaking of the pamphlets, Mayawati began to open up, which is not usually with her
 vah ek sahaj or bephikr netaa kii tarah swami prasad maury par hamalaa kiye ja rahi thim
 In the process, some things were repeated but their flow seemed pleasant
 vah apane upar lagaae gaye aaropon kaa bhi sahajata se jawaab de rahi thim
 She went on to say that i am called a daughter of Daulat, not of Dalit
 ab mere samaaj ke log apni kshamta se kam-zyaada de dete hai
 Do not let me lack wealth
 jab bhi koi basapa se jaataa he aarope lagaataa he ki tikat bik rahi thi
 Apart from this, they have nothing else
 maurya ne bataaya he ki unhone apane or apane bete betiyon ke tikat ke liye kitne paise diye
 Mayawati often reads all these things in writing, but on Wednesday she seemed more effective
 hans rahi thim, patrakaron ke sawaal kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar lag rahi thim
 By doing this, there was a message from his body language that he is in control
 vah is ghatana se hili nahin hai
 Generally, she does not hold press conferences while taking someone out
 yah bhi koshish hoti he ki nikaale gaye kisi vyakti ko mahatv na diya jaae
 But Maurya must have had some importance that even if Mayawati's senses did not fly, the emeralds flew out of her hands! mayawati ko khud buudhvaar ke press conference kii recording dekhni chahie
 They will see their own personality differently
 unhen isi tarah reliyon or conference main jaakar bolnaa chahie
 The written speech makes Mayawati formal and official
 videsh mantralay kaa pravaktaa likhit panktiyon se daayen baayen nahin hota
 Mayawati's written statements and speeches have also started happening
 videsh mantralay ke pravaktaa kaa bayaan aam janata ke liye tab tak bematlab kaa ho jaataa he jab tak ki videshi niti ko padhane vaale kuch khaas log use gaur se na dekhen
 The same situation has happened to the statements of the BSP leader
 kader kush ho jaataa he or janata udasin
 It seems that she is trying to avoid need
 raajnneeti main apane aapako bachaakar duusare par hamalaa chalata nahin he
 You also have to be at stake
 amareeki congress main pradhanmantri modi kaa likhit bhaashan unhen alag rup main pesh karata he lekin ve reliyon main kabhi bhi parche main ankhen gadaakar bhaashan nahin dete
 Mayawati and Sonia Gandhi do this by converting the rally into a press conference or seminar
 rahul gandhi vigat varsh jab chhuttiyon se laut kar aae to kaagaz kii taraf kam, satta paksh kii taraf dekhakar zyada bol rahe the
 It was noted that it was a changed Rahul but soon the form was again in his hands
 parche ne rahul ko baandh diya
 By the way, he speaks very little and does not speak new things
 pradhanmantri modi par unka hamalaa basi ho chukaa he
 That is the whole bath modi ji sab jaanate hai
 Rahul should also talk about new things irrespective of right and wrong
 baat sirf chhavi kii nahin 
 When there is no form in the hands of the leader, then people get a chance to look into the leader's mind
 janata netaa kii jubaan kii phislan ko samajhati he lekin sochane kii prakriya se judakar vah netaa ko zyaada number detii he
 Therefore, Mayawati should come in the form of public
 satish mishra ke liye parche kii raajnneeti chhod deni chahie
 Being comfortable with the leader of the BSP will only benefit
 party ko bhi uplabdh rahane vaale pravaktaaon ko niyukt karnaa chahie isse party main nae chehre paidaa hote hai
 This work should be learned from BJP
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh se nahin
 Those coming from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh call themselves Sangh ideologues, not spokespersons
 sangh main pravaktaa hai lekin tivi par kai log vichaarak banakar kyon aate hai!tippaniyan BSP also does not have a spokesperson
 pro
 Eligible people like Vivek Kumar, Dr
 Chandrabhan Prasad and Sudhindra Bhadauria emerge as unannounced spokespersons
 ve professor hai, samajashastri hai lekin unke na chaahate hue bhi janata unhen pravaktaa hi samajhati he kyonki ve basapa kaa hi bachaav kar rahe hote hai
 If given a chance, these people can outweigh everyone
 inhen bhi khud ko dalit chintak bataanaa chahie vaise hi jaise sangh ke pravaktaaon ko sangh vichaarak bataaya jaataa he
 If they are thinkers then what is Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat ji! yah darshakon ke saath anyaay he or andolan se nikalne vaali ek party ke kamazor aatmavishvaas par gambhir tippanee bhi
 The Dalit community is confident
 basapa kii gatividhiyon main bhi vah aatmavishvaas jhalakana chahie
 If Mayawati is changing, then there should be a change in the party
 kam se kam bina likhaa hua bhaashan dena chahie
 i have been watching Mayawati read the speech written on TV since ages
 unki yah baat kuch jamati nahin thi
 On Wednesday, when the old leader of his party, Swami Prasad Maurya, resigned, information came that Mayawati would also hold a press conference
 mujhe laga ki vah phir likhaa hua das pankti kaa bayaan laaengi or padhakar chali jaaengi
 but that did not happen
 mayawati ain or likhaa hue kuch bhi nahin laayi
 Shortly before, i had told a friend that there is no spokesperson for the media in the BSP and Mayawati will also come and read the paper
 lekin mayawati bade se darvaaze kii oot main khadi hokar bolne lageen
 Removed the armor of the page but could not remove the door
 har netaa apni tarah se asurakshit hota he
 Well Mayawati soon came in a trance
 vah jaldi hi panne or parche se azaad ho gayi, laga ki duusari mayawati dekh rahaa hum
 When the leader is full of confidence, he has an amazing grip on dialogue
 uske chintan or bolte samay satarkta or pravaah kii prakriya zyaada bharosa paidaa karti he
 He seems to have won politics and is speaking what he has won
 basapa ke mahasachiv ke party chhodane kii khabar ne party ke cader ko bhi stabdh kar diya tha
 The BSP cadre is also watching Mayawati to see how she does in this election
 uske man main kanshiram ke khadaa kiye gaye andolan kii chintaa rahati he
 Mayawati was addressing her cadre more than attacking Maurya, who is called the man of the movement
 yah tabaqa 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaav main shunya par pahunchane vaali basapa ko lekar pareshaan he
 He is busy with the UP election but now his eyes are not only on the ground, but also on the sky where his leadership sits
 bin parche ke bolte hue mayawati khulne lageen jo aamtaur par unke saath nahin hota
 Swami Prasad Maurya was being attacked like a simple and carefree leader
 is prakriya main kuch baton ko doharaaya bhi lekin unka dhara pravaah hona sukhad lag rahaa tha
 She was also spontaneously responding to the allegations leveled against her
 vah bolti chali gayi ki mujhe dalit kii nahin daulat kii beti kehete hai
 Now people of my society give more than their capacity
 mujhe daulat kii kami nahin hone dete
 Whenever someone goes to the BSP, it is alleged that the ticket was being sold
 iske alaava kuch or unke paas nahin hota
 Maurya has told how much money he gave for the ticket for himself and his sons and daughters
 inhen sab baton ko mayawati aksar likhaa hua padhati hai lekin buudhvaar ko vah zyaada asardaar lag rahi thim
 She was laughing, seemed ready to face the question of the journalists
 aisa karne se unki dehbhasha se yah sandesh bhi gaya ki vah control main hai
 He is not moved by this incident
 aam taur par vah kisi ko nikaalte vakt press conference nahin karti
 It is also an attempt not to give importance to someone who is fired
 lekin maurya kaa kuch to mahatv rahaa hoga ki mayawati ke hosh bhale na ude hon unke haathon se panne ud gaye the! Mayawati herself should watch the recording of Wednesday's press conference
 unhen apana hi vyaktitv alag nazar aayega
 They should also speak at rallies and conferences
 likhaa hua bhaashan mayawati ko aupchaarik or sarkari banaata he
 The Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson is not left to right with written lines
 mayawati ke likhit bayaan or bhaashan bhi aise hone lage hai
 The statement of the spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs becomes meaningless to the general public until some special people reading foreign policy see it carefully
 vahi haal basapa netaa ke bayanon kaa ho gaya he
 The cadre is happy and the public is indifferent
 aisa lagata he ki vah zarurat se bachane kaa prayaas kar rahi hai
 In politics, protecting oneself does not attack others
 khud ko bhi daanv par lagaana hota he
 Prime Minister Modi's written speech in the US Congress presents him in a different way, but he never gives a speech in rallies with eyes folded in the leaflet
 mayawati or sonia gandhi aisa karke raily ko press conference yaa seminar main badal detii hai
 When Rahul Gandhi returned from holidays last year, he was speaking less on paper, more on the ruling side
 yah notice kiya gaya ki yah badale hue rahul hai lekin jaldi hi unke haath main parchaa phir se aa gaya
 The leaflet tied Rahul
 vaise vah kaaphi kam bolte hai or nai nai baat nahin bolte
 His attack on Prime Minister Modi has become stale
 vahi batiyaa sari ratiyaa
 Modi ji knows everything
 rahul ko bhi galat sahi kii parvaah kiye bagair nai nai baaten kerani chahie
 It is not just about the image
 jab netaa ke haath main parchaa nahin hota he tab janata ko netaa ke man main jhaankne kaa mauka miltaa he
 The public understands the slippery of the leader's tongue but by joining the thinking process, she gives the leader a higher number
 isliye mayawati ko isi rup main janata ke bich aana chahie
 Prescription politics should be left for Satish Mishra
 basapa ke netaa ko sahaj hone se laabh hi milegaa
 The party should also appoint spokespersons who are available, this creates new faces in the party
 yah kaam bhaajapa se siikhnaa chahie
 Not from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 rashtriya swayamsevak sangh kii taraf se aane vaale vaqta khud ko sangh vichaarak kehete hai, pravaktaa nahin
 There are spokespersons in the Sangh but why do many people come on TV as thinkers! basapa ke bhi pravaktaa nahin hote
 Pro
 vivek kumaar, doctor chandrabhan prasad or sudhindra bhadauria jaise yogya log aghoshit pravaktaa banakar avatarit hote hai
 He is a professor, a sociologist, but despite his unwillingness, the public considers him a spokesman because he is defending the BSP
 mauka mili to ye log sab par baari pad sakate hai
 They should also call themselves Dalit thinkers, just like the spokespersons of the Sangh are called Sangh thinkers
 agar ve vichaarak hai to sangh pramukh mohan bhagwat ji kya hai ! It is an injustice to the audience and also serious commentary on the weak confidence of a party emanating from the movement
 dalit samudaay aatmavishvaas se labalab he
 That confidence should also be reflected in the activities of the BSP
 mayawati agar badal rahi hai to thodaa party main bhi badlaav karnaa chahie
 At least unscripted speech should be given
 mayawati ain or likhaa hue kuch bhi nahin laayi

 Swami Prasad Maurya was being attacked like a simple and carefree leader
 is prakriya main kuch baton ko doharaaya bhi lekin unka dhara pravaah hona sukhad lag rahaa tha
 She was also spontaneously responding to the allegations leveled against her
 vah bolti chali gayi ki mujhe dalit kii nahin daulat kii beti kehete hai
 Now people of my society give more than their capacity
 mujhe daulat kii kami nahin hone dete
 Whenever someone goes to the BSP, it is alleged that the ticket was being sold
 iske alaava kuch or unke paas nahin hota
 Maurya has told how much money he gave for the ticket for himself and his sons and daughters
 inhen sab baton ko mayawati aksar likhaa hua padhati hai lekin buudhvaar ko vah zyaada asardaar lag rahi thim
 She was laughing, seemed ready to face the question of the journalists
 aisa karne se unki dehbhasha se yah sandesh bhi gaya ki vah control main hai
 He is not moved by this incident
 aam taur par vah kisi ko nikaalte vakt press conference nahin karti
 It is also an attempt not to give importance to someone who is fired
 lekin maurya kaa kuch to mahatv rahaa hoga ki mayawati ke hosh bhale na ude hon unke haathon se panne ud gaye the! Mayawati herself should watch the recording of Wednesday's press conference
 unhen apana hi vyaktitv alag nazar aayega
 They should also speak at rallies and conferences
 likhaa hua bhaashan mayawati ko aupchaarik or sarkari banaata he
 The Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson is not left to right with written lines
 mayawati ke likhit bayaan or bhaashan bhi aise hone lage hai
 The statement of the spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs becomes meaningless to the general public until some special people reading foreign policy see it carefully
 vahi haal basapa netaa ke bayanon kaa ho gaya he

 In politics, protecting oneself does not attack others
 khud ko bhi daanv par lagaana hota he
 Prime Minister Modi's written speech in the US Congress presents him in a different way, but he never gives a speech in rallies with eyes folded in the leaflet
 mayawati or sonia gandhi aisa karke raily ko press conference yaa seminar main badal detii hai

 kisi bhi gunahagaar ko kanoon kii najar main gunahagaar tehraane ke liye subooton or gavaahon kii darkaar hoti he
 It means to say that no decision can be made without judgment on the judgment of justice in human settlement, but if someone is punished on the basis of doubt and that too in a barbaric and unscrupulous way, what would you call it? The After Dimapur, another such face of the crowd has emerged from Nagaland in the north-eastern state
 dimapurki ghatana ke baad saamne aae is video main ek shaks ko badi hi barbarta se peeta ja rahaa he
 Just as the rape accused in Dimapur was beaten
 is shaks par apane hi pados main rahanevaali ek maasoom bacchee ke saath balaatkaar or qatl kaa ilzaam tha or ittefaq se ye tasviren bhi usee soobe kii he, jahaan se pichley dinon saamne ai aisi hi ek tasviir ne logon ko sakate main daal diya tha
 In fact, this incident of killing a man in the middle ground in a barbaric manner is on the last of September 18 when a man named Lobobi Singh, surrounded by some such charges, went up to the mob
 lekin isse pehle ki police use giraftaar karti, uske khilaaf koi mukadmaa chalaaya jaataa, insaaf kii adaalat main use gunaahagaar tehraaya jaataa, bheed ne apane hi kaayade-kaanoonon ke mutabik use gunahagaar bhi tehra diya or maut kii sazaa bhi de di
 The punishment is also such that the heart of the audience comes to the mouth
 ghatana ke thik ek roj pehle lobobi ke pados main rahanevaali 11 saal kii ek bacchee rahasyamayi tareeqe se gaayab ho gai thi or duusare din nazadik ke jangal se uski laash baraamad hui
 After this incident, the first suspicion went to his neighbor Lobobi
 lekin isse pehle ki lobobi ko giraftaar kiya jaataa, wo apane ghar se bhaag niklaa
 But he had just come out of the town of Meluri a little while that people caught him
 ab baari thi use uske tathakthith gunahon kii sazaa dene kii
 So, at first, the crowd took him to a field and then in an open place he was naked and hanged with sticks and ropes
 or tab shuru hui wo karatuut jise dekh kar kisi ke bhi rongte khadey ho jaaen
 The crowd began beating Lobobi publicly
 log puri taaqat se ek ek kar us lathi-danda or rod samet tamaam hathiyaaron se hamale karne lage
 As soon as he saw it, his body got cut from place to place and he fainted after being bled
 pehle to usne chatapata kar khud ko bachaane kii bhi koshish kii lekin baad main wo behosh ho gaya
 But the anger of the people did not subside even after this and finally after beating him something like this, he killed him
 sutron kii maane to tab bhi police ne is shaks ko bheed ke changul se bachaane kii koshish thi, lekin bheed ne vardiwaalon ko dur khaded diya tha
 Then this story of justice of the crowd did not make much headlines, but now this video which came out after the Dimapur incident has brought the shameful truth of Nagaland back
 dimapur se manogna loiwal Film Name: Caravandirector: Aakarsh Khuranstar Cast: Irrfan, Dulquer Salman, Mithila Palkar, Kriti Kharbanda Duration: 2 Hours Certificate: u / a Rating: 3
 5 stardiarector aakarsh khurana lambe samay se theatre se jude hue hai or haal hi main unhone 'hai jaik' banaai thi, jise box offis par khaas rispons nahin mila, lekin jab unki film kaaravaan kaa trailor relies kiya gaya, tab se lekar abhi tak film ko dekhne ke liye darshakon kaa utsaah dekhte ban rahaa he
 Now the film has been released
 padhie isaki samiksha:kahani:film kii kahani avinaash (dulkar salmaan ) ko ai ek phone kol se shuru hoti he , jahaan use bataaya jaataa he ki uske pitaaji kii deth ho gai he or korier company kii taraf se kisi or kii ded body avinaash ko de di jaati he or phir vah apane pita kii ded body kii talash main apane dost shaukat (irafaan) ke saath nikal padataa he, phir is kaaravaan main tanya (mithila paalkar) kii entry hoti he, yatra kai jagahon se guzarate hue twist or terns ke saath aage badhati he, ab kya avinaash ko sahi body mil paati he, kahani main aage kya hota he, or is tarah puri yatra ke dauraan avinaash, tanya or shaukat ke rishton kaa taana-bana buna jaataa he, ye sab kuch jaanane ke liye aapako film dekhni padegi
 Caravan will come in Irfan's absence, can be hit due to these reasons: Can see: The story and the writing of the film is amazing, Bijoy Nambiar has written this journey well
 hossain dalal ke samvaad or aakarsh khurana kaa screenple bhi jabardast he 
 The jokes you have seen in the trailer are more than what you see in this film
 hindi filmon main is film ke saath entry maarane vaale dulkar salmaan kaa abhinay jabardast he
 Seeing them, it seems that they act quite comfortable and simple
 unke saath utyub senceshan mithila paalkar ne bhi acha kaam kiya he , donon kii camestry laajawab he
 While Irrfan's presence takes the film to a different level, the way Irfan plays the character as well as the dialogues is tremendous
 bas itnaa samaj lijie ki jab-jab irfan khan aate hai aapke chehre par muskaan jarur aa jaati he
 Film The art of the film is amazing and the cinematography is also very good
 film kii acchhee baat yah bhi he ki is kii length 2 ghante kii he jo dekhne main kaaphi aasaan he or jab film khatm hone vaali rahati he to jahan main sirf ek hi baat chalati he yah jarney or bhi aage badhati rahani chahie thi
 4 Chemo complete, Irrfan gave treatment information for the first time after illness
 Weak link: The weak link of the film is its songs which were not hit before release, the film slows down a bit in the second half but the presence of Irrfan Khan Makes it more entertaining
 pramotion ke dauraan irfan kii maujuudagi ise or bhi zyada popular bana sakati thi
 Box Office: The film has a budget of about 20 crores and has been released in about 1000 screens
 teen filmon ke bich agar verde of mouth sahi rahaa to film acha collection kar sakati he
 An environment of hate allows for rumour-mongers inciting mob lynching
 This is the result of silence of leadership when crimes are committed with impunity by harbingers of hate 
 Why no Mann Ki Baat on hate crimes since 2014? — Kapil Sibal (@kapilsibal) July 3, 2018 This is the result of silence of leadership when crimes are committed with impunity by harbingers of hate
 Why no Mann ki Baat on hate crimes since 2014 ? - Kapil Sibal (@kapilsibal) July 3, 2018 Why no Mann ki Baat on hate crimes since 2014 ? Playing the second Test match of his career, opener Shikhar Dhawan has to prove through the Eden Test that he is one of India's one-day matches as well as India's dependable Test opener
 dhawan ne apane kariyar kaa pehla test isi varsh march main mohali main khelaa tha
 He had a brilliant innings of 187 runs in that match, but he was injured during the same Test
 apni is pari ke dauraan dhawan ne bharat ke liye padaarpan karte hue sabase tej shatak lagaaya tha
 He was seen filling the place of Virender Sehwag as he was selected in the Test team in place of Sehwag
 chot se ubarkar dhawan ne ipel main vaapasi kii thi or apni sunrisers hyderabad team ke liye kai upyogi paariyaan khelin
 After this, Dhawan also batted well in the Champions League, England tour, West Indies tour, the one-day series held in Zimbabwe and the recently concluded one-day series with Australia
 april 2013 se lekar do november tak dhawan ne ek-divasiy maichon main chaar shatak lagaae or khud ko salaami ballebaaj ke taur par sthapit kiya
 There was a sense of confidence in him and he appeared to be making style icons in his own way
 dhawan ne 16 june 2013 se lekar do oktober, 2013 tak 114, 102 naabad, 116 or 100 ranon kii paariyaan khelin
 Apart from this, he scored four fifties as 60, 95, 69, 68 runs
 dhawan khud ko ek-divasiy team main sthapit kar chuke hai, lekin test team main unhen apni kaabiliyat sabit kerani baaki he
 An innings does not secure anyone's place
 gautam gambhir or virendra sahvaag aaj bhi salaami ballebaaj ke daavedaaron main se ek hai
 In such a situation, Dhawan will have to show that while playing a good innings in Eden, his innings of Mohali was not a coincidence
 eden or kolkata test kii chaar pariyon main dhawan ke paas yah sabit karne kaa mauka he
 When Dhawan came to bat after West Indies innings for 234 runs, he looked confident
 iskaa kaaran unki bindaas style or bindaas swabhaav he
 During the practice session the day before the match, Dhawan was the one who accepted the most audience greetings
 dhawan aise khilaadi hai, jo prashansakon ke saath sadaa jude rahane par yakeen karte hai
 His popularity is at a peak these days and that is why he does not want to disappoint his fans

 unhone kaha ki jin logon ne pradesh main araajaktaa failaai, lutaa hi nahin nocha, unako pradesh kii khushhaali acchhee nahi lagegi, aise log sadan se baahar rahen tabhi acha he
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said about the achievements of the government and said that the state had lagged behind in 15 years
 lekin aaj kai yojanaon main pradesh pehle sthaan par he
 Be it Saubhagya Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, wheat production or skill development, the state is number one in all these areas
 yogi ne kaha ki uttar pradesh main 21-23 janvari ko pravasi bhartiya diwas banaaya gaya jo ek chunauti thi

 He said that during the Governor's address his leader faints but still makes noise, which is shameful
 pichhali sarkaron kaa zikr karte hue yogi ne kaha ki pichhali sarkaar ne jis tarah kaa coridor banane kaa kaam kiya wo bhrashtachar or dange kaa tha
 Our government is giving a corridor of defense, a corridor of development within 22 months
 ram janmabhumi ke mudde par yogi ne kaha ki pichhali sarkaar ne aropiyon ko chhodane kaa kaam kiya tha
 We did our work translating 1 lakh pages in 6 months
 unhone kaha aasthaa kaa sammaan hona chahie
 The three pillars of faith are Ayodhya, Mathura and Kashi in our state
 dow
 Ram Manohar Lohia called Lord Rama, Shiva and Krishna the nation of India
 is baat ko lohia samaj sakate hai, par unke chele nahin
 They only want to gain everything on muscle power
 yogi adityanath ne samaajawaadee party ke mukhiya akhilesh yadav par hamalaa bolte hue kaha ki ve smarakon ko tod kar marriage haul banane kii baat karte the
 Will Akhilesh Yadav share Murthy's money like seats
 bispi supremeo mayawati par kataaksh karte hue yogi ne kaha vaise paisa khub lutaa he bhattije ko dena bhi chahie
 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that the change depends on the elected government
 jab netritv dishaheen ho, chor ho, duraachaari ho, to sarkaar waisi hi hogi
 Those who insult faith should not remain in power
 unhone kaha ki 2013 ke kumbh main kitna bada haadasa hua, is baar kumbh main ek tinkaa bhi nahin hilaa
 People who are pointing fingers at the Aquarius will be missing the common wealth

 Hello Ravish Kumar, good days are coming from and good days have come and where are good days
 radio, efem, tivi channel latifon ke tamaam kaarykram akhbaar raajnneetik bahesbaazi in sabamein achche din aa gaye hai ko lekar itane prayog ho rahe hai ki ek din yah slogan hi mudda na ban jaae
 Good days are coming before the election that the outright understanding was that Manmohan Singh's government should go and change the system
 in paanch saalon main achche din ko lekar jo bhi vyakhya hogi wo vyaktigat se lekar samuhik str par itani vyapak hogi ki abhi se hi isaki safai dete dete vibhinn staron par sambandhon main bhi kadavaahat paidaa hone lagi he
 In a mature democracy, voters and citizen groups should be expected to keep in mind the context and various aspects of the government's time when evaluating the work of a government
 lekin yah chhot kisi sarkaar ko kyon mili
 Did the BJP take such concessions with the Manmohan government or any other governments in the states while in opposition
 chunaavon ke dauraan vipakshi netaa ke taur par narendra modi ne khud ko ek raftaar ke pratik ke rup main bhi pesh kiya tha
 His preaching speeches had no place for waiting and patience
 desh ab intazaar nahin kar saktaa ke is daur main rail kiraaya badhane ke saath log twitor ke gart se 2012 kaa modi kaa hi twit nikaal kar baantne lagate hai ki tab to aapane virodh kiya tha ki sansad se pehle kaise bad gaya kiraaya or khud badha diya
 Then there is a slight annoyance of the government when it is said that it is a tough decision, but it is right and is necessary for the worldwide railway system
 haftaa bhi nahin guzarataa he ki maharashtra ke chunaavon ko dekhte hue local trainon kaa kiraaya waapas le liya jaataa he
 But this exemption is not available to travelers from other states
 teen maheene tak gas ke daam nahin badhaaye jane kaa elaan ho jaataa he kya yah chunavi faisla nahin he jo pichhali sarkaar bhi liya karti thi
 Today is the statement of MG Vaidya of RSS that Modi had asked for 100 days, not a month, people should wait for some time before estimating them
 aaj hi pradhanmantri narendra modi ne hindi main nahin balki angreji main blog likhaa he
 Addressing Deer Friends, Prime Minister Modi writes that today our government has completed one month
 67 saal kii sarkaron kaa ek maheene kii sarkaar se muqaabala nahin kiya ja saktaa
 When we took over a month ago, i was thinking that i am new to this place and some people believe that it will take me at least a year to understand the specifics of working in the central government
 saubhaahgya se ek maheene baad ye vichaar ab mere man main nahin he
 i am facing a big challenge in Delhi and that is that we are trying to tell a few selected people about our intentions and their seriousness towards a positive change in the country
 ye wo log hai jo sarkari system ke andar or baahar donon jagah maujuud hai
 There have been many such occasions in the last month, which had nothing to do with our government, yet these controversies remain
 main kisi ko dosha nahin detaa, lekin ye mahasoos karata hum ki hamen aise system majboot karne chahie jinase sahi logon tak sahi samay par sahi baaten pahunchaai ja saken
 Hopefully something will change then
 har nai sarkaar ke liye media ke dost honeymoon period kaa istemaal karte hai
 The previous governments had the freedom to extend this honeymoon period for a hundred days or more
 ye apratyaashit nahin he ki mujhe aisi koi chhot nahin he
 Forget hundred days, within a hundred hours the charge has started
 lekin jab koi raashtra kii seva karne ke ekmaatr uddeshy se kaam kar rahaa ho to is sabase fark nahin padataa
 This is the reason why i keep working and that gives me satisfaction
 is blog ko baar-baar padhane kii zarurat he
 However, the government has done a lot in these thirty days
 apni praathamiktaayen tay kii hai kai sansthaanon ke daure kiye gaye hai, kai faisle bhi hue hai
 Foreign policy has been praised
 is nazar se dekhiye to kaaphi kuch thik disha main he
 There is definitely the issue of inflation, which people wait for every day to subside and in the absence of which BJP used to agitate every day during the days of opposition even when international conditions were not in the government's control
 agar ucch stareey baithken ho rahi hai to unke nattejey main doodhchini dijal petrol rail kiraaya aadi se lekar ityadi ke daam kaise bad rahe hai
 The lack of monsoon and the challenge of Iraq have come to the fore
 lekin mahangaai to tab bhi badha karti thi jab monsoon thik hua karata tha
 Do governments really have measures to reduce inflation? us sarkaar kii tarah is sarkaar ne bhi kaha ki rajyon ko nirdesh die gaye hai ki jamaakhoron ko pakadaa jaae
 How many hoarders were caught in that government and how many have been caught in this government, it is not known yet, but today the government has told the states that special courts should be made for speedy hearing of the cases against hoarders and black marketers
 pradhanmantri ne supreme court se aapraadhik maamalon ke aaropee saansadon ke maamle ko ek saal main nipataane kii baat kahi thi
 Has it been written to the Supreme Court
 ek mantri par balaatkaar ke aarope ek mantri ke halafname main antar ke aarope ek mantri kaa sena kii ek tukdi ko dakaiton kii toli kah dene kya in sab vivaadon kaa sambandh vaaki sarkaar se nahin tha
 There are also questions about the government's attitude towards bureaucracy and constitutional institutions from a political and professional perspective
 mantriyon ke privet secreti rakhane ke maamle main bhi piemo hastkshep karata he to pradhanmantri apane pradhan sachiv kii niyukti ke liye adhyadesh kaa sahaara lete hai
 While meeting the secretaries and giving the mantra to take professional and bold steps, they also bring Gujarat cadre officers
 piemo main ek adhikari kii niyukti hoti he, lekin saarvajanik soochna jari hone ke agle din radd ho jaati he
 Are we not doing too much by asking so many questions in thirty days? vaise ek aadmi ne jyaadati nahin kii he

 However, it would be difficult for me to think about being pregnant right now because i have a lot of work to do at the moment
 lekin koun jaanata he ki kab kahaan se meri god main ek baccha aa jaae
 And everyone should be surprised that where did this baby finally come from? Sunny Leone wants a baby soon, but is afraid of getting pregnant, recently, about spending time with children, Sunny had said, 'my children are made of children
 vaaki ham dil se milte hai
 
 lagbhag paaglon ke jaise
 Once a child was not even ready to go with his mother, he had to stay with me only
 
 
 vaaki ajeeb sthiti ban gai thi
 i love children very much
 khushkismat rahi to ek din meri god main bhi baby hoga or us din khuda kii khub shukraguzaar rahuungi

 The announcement of VS Laxman's sudden retirement has created controversy and it is believed that the cricket board and the selection committee were not treated well by the artistic batsman
 purv bhartiya captain saurav ganguli ne shrikant par aarope lagaae ki vah senior ke saath samvadaheenata banaae rakhte hai
 Laxman was picked in the squad for a two-test series against New Zealand starting in his hometown Hyderabad from August 23, but surprised everyone by announcing his retirement with immediate effect

 No one knows the secret behind Laxman's sudden retirement, but it is believed that this great batsman was hurt by the events of the last few weeks
 lakshmana ne apni taraf se aisa koi suraag nahin choda ki aakhir unhone sanyas kyon liya
 He just said that he heard his conscience and decided that this is the right time to retire
 unke sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa ke ek din baad yah badi charchaa kaa vishay he ki aakhir unhen sanyas lene ke liye kyon majaboor hona padaa? The BCCI has said that there was no pressure on Laxman to retire

 a BCCI official said on condition of confidentiality, "we didn't really know anything
" ho saktaa he ki kuch hua ho, jiske kaaran unhen aisa faisla karnaa padaa, lekin hamane kabhi un par dabaav nahin banaaya tha
 He said that he may have been hurt by the negative comments of some former cricketers in his column and the BCCI could not defend him
 nishchit taur par vah sanyas ke bare main nahin soch rahe the
 No issue was discussed with him
 shaayad vah yah dikhaanaa chaahate the ki vah apni sharton par sanyas le sakate hai
 Another former official said, "the selectors had selected him for the series against New Zealand, so there is no question of putting pressure on him
" unhone khelnaa pasand kyon nahin kiya, iskaa jawaab vahi de sakate hai
 The selection committee chairman k Srikkanth, who is leaving his post next month, is also being blamed for Laxman's retirement
 shrikant ne kaha, ham unke turant prabhaav se sanyas lene ke faisle kaa sammaan karte hai
 We wish him and his family all the best

 purv bhartiya captain saurav ganguli ne shrikant par aarope lagaae hai
 He said that he maintains communication gap with senior players

 He said, they do not choose the team keeping in mind the future of Indian cricket
 ve kisi ko hataakar or kisi ko shaamil karke santulan banane kii koshish karte hai
 Indian cricket will not proceed this way
 tippaniyan It is also being said that after the team selection, a selector called Laxman and said that this would be his farewell series
 isse yah diggaj ballebaaj aahat hua or unke sanyas ke liye yahi mukhya kaaran mana ja rahaa he
 Sources said, in this way he gave a befitting reply to the selectors that he would retire on his own terms
 chayankartaaon kii senior khilaadiyon saath samvadaheenata rahati he, iskaa namoona pichley saal england ke khilaaf ek-divasiy shrunkhlaa ke dauraan bhi dekhne ko mila tha
 Rahul Dravid, who showed good form in Test cricket, was selected in the one-day team after two years, due to which Dravid suddenly had to retire from this format
 is tarah se unhone chayankartaaon ko karaara jawaab diya tha
 Laxman also adopted the method of Dravid
 unke sanyas lene par sachin tendulkar, harbhajan singh, yuvaraj singh sabhi ne hairaani jataai he
 Laxman was picked in the squad for a two-test series against New Zealand starting in his hometown Hyderabad from August 23, but surprised everyone by announcing his retirement with immediate effect
 sabase hairaani kii baat yah rahi ki 134 test match khilne or inamen se kai main desh ko jeet dilaane vaale lakshmana ne apane gharelu darshakon ke saamne vidaai test match khilne kaa avasar bhi thukraa diya
 No one knows the secret behind Laxman's sudden retirement, but it is believed that this great batsman was hurt by the events of the last few weeks
 lakshmana ne apni taraf se aisa koi suraag nahin choda ki aakhir unhone sanyas kyon liya
 He just said that he heard his conscience and decided that this is the right time to retire
 unke sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa ke ek din baad yah badi charchaa kaa vishay he ki aakhir unhen sanyas lene ke liye kyon majaboor hona padaa? The BCCI has said that there was no pressure on Laxman to retire
 bisisiai haalanki newjiland ke khilaaf ek bhi match nahin khilne ke unke faisle se sakate main he
 a BCCI official said on condition of confidentiality, "we didn't really know anything
" ho saktaa he ki kuch hua ho, jiske kaaran unhen aisa faisla karnaa padaa, lekin hamane kabhi un par dabaav nahin banaaya tha
 He said that he may have been hurt by the negative comments of some former cricketers in his column and the BCCI could not defend him
 nishchit taur par vah sanyas ke bare main nahin soch rahe the
 No issue was discussed with him
 shaayad vah yah dikhaanaa chaahate the ki vah apni sharton par sanyas le sakate hai
 Another former official said, "the selectors had selected him for the series against New Zealand, so there is no question of putting pressure on him
" unhone khelnaa pasand kyon nahin kiya, iskaa jawaab vahi de sakate hai
 The selection committee chairman k Srikkanth, who is leaving his post next month, is also being blamed for Laxman's retirement
 shrikant ne kaha, ham unke turant prabhaav se sanyas lene ke faisle kaa sammaan karte hai
 We wish him and his family all the best

 Laxman also adopted the method of Dravid
 unke sanyas lene par sachin tendulkar, harbhajan singh, yuvaraj singh sabhi ne hairaani jataai he
 Surprisingly, Laxman, who played 134 Test matches and won the country in many of them, turned down the opportunity to play a farewell Test match in front of his home audience
 lakshmana ke achaanak sanyas lene kii ghoshnaa ke peeche kaa raaj kya he, yah kisi ko pataa nahin he, lekin mana ja rahaa he ki yah mahaan ballebaaj pichley kuch saptaah kii ghatnaon se aahat tha
 Laxman left no such clue from his side as to why he retired
 unhone sirf itnaa kaha ki unhone apni antaratma kii aawaaj suni or faisla kiya ki yah sanyas lene kaa sahi samay he
 The day after he announced his retirement, it is a matter of great discussion why he was forced to retire
 bisisiai ne kaha he ki lakshmana par sanyas lene ke liye kisi tarah kaa dabaav nahin tha
 The BCCI, however, is in a bind due to their decision not to play a single match against New Zealand
 bisisiai ke ek adhikari ne gopneeyata kii shart par kaha, hamen vastav main kuch pataa nahin tha
 Maybe something happened, due to which they had to take such a decision, but we never pressurized them
 unhone kaha, ho saktaa he ki kuch purv cricketron kii apane kollam main nakaaratmak tippni se vah aahat hue hon or aise main bisisiai unka bachaav nahin kar saktaa tha
 He was certainly not thinking about retirement
 unke saath kisi kii bhi kisi mudde par charchaa nahin hui thi
 Perhaps he wanted to show that he could retire on his own terms
 ek anya purv adhikari ne kaha, chayankartaaon ne unhen newjiland ke khilaaf shrunkhlaa ke liye chunaa tha, isliye un par dabaav banane kaa sawaal hi paidaa nahin hota
 He can answer why he did not like to play
 chayansmiti ke adhyaksh ke shrikant jo agle maheene apana pad chhod rahe hai, ko bhi lakshmana ke sanyas ke liye doshi tehraaya ja rahaa he
 Srikanth said, we respect his decision to retire with immediate effect
 ham unhen or unke parivaar ko shubhakamanaayen dete hai
 He was a team player
 unhone puure sammaan ke saath desh kaa pratinidhitiv kiya
 He won many matches for the country
 unka yogadan amuly he
 Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly has accused Srikanth
 unhone kaha ki vah senior khilaadiyon ke saath samvadaheenata banaae rakhte hai
 Ganguly also feels that the selection policy is not in line with the progress of Indian cricket
 unhone kaha, ve bhartiya cricket ke bhavishya ko dhyaan main rakhkar team kaa chayan nahin karte
 They try to balance by removing and involving someone
 bhartiya cricket is tarah se aage nahin badhegaa
 The comments yah bhi kaha ja rahaa he ki team chayan ke baad ek chayankarta ne lakshmana ko phone karke kaha ki yah unki vidaai shrunkhlaa hogi
 This hurt the veteran batsman and this is believed to be the main reason for his retirement
 sutron ne kaha, is tarah se unhone chayankartaaon ko karaara jawaab diya ki vah apni sharton par sanyas lenge
 The selectors have a lack of communication with the senior players, which was also seen during the one-day series against England last year
 test cricket main acchhee form dikhaane vaale rahul dravid ko do saal baad van-de team main chunaa gaya, jiske kaaran dravid ko achaanak hi is praaroop se sanyas lenaa padaa tha
 In this way he gave a befitting reply to the selectors
 lakshmana ne bhi dravid kaa tarika apanaaya
 Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh have all expressed surprise at his retirement

 He said, "but i am not blaming anyone

 In place of Tytler, JP Aggarwal is the Congress candidate from the north-eastern Parliamentary constituency
 apane nirdosh hone kaa daawa karte hue titalar ne kaha ki nyaayalay main ek bhi shapath patr nahin pesh kiya gaya he jisase unke varsh 1984 ke dangon se sambandh ko sabit kiya ja sake
 He said that more than 10 commissions were formed during the Congress and BJP rule and no one was able to prove his connection with the riots case

 " On Friday, there was a sudden stir within the dry and dry and dull corridors of the Home Ministry
 pataa chalaa, akshay kumaar yahaan aae hue hai
 a senior official told NDTV India, 'akshay Kumar has created an app through which he wants to help the soldiers of the security forces, especially the paramilitary forces, who are martyred
 usee ap ke silsile main wo aae hai
 He told, 'that app will be formally launched soon
 usase yah faaydaa hoga ki jo chahega wo sidhaa javaanon ke parivaar ko paisa de sakegaa
 'earlier in a video shared, Akshay said that' the soldiers of the security forces who are martyred are compensated by the government which is the duty of the government
 lekin hamamen se bahut se aise log hai jo apni taraf se aise javaanon ke parijanon ke liye kuch karnaa chaahate hai lekin logon ko pataa hi nahin hota ki aisa karen kaise, un javaanon tak pahunche kaise, unka pataa kya he
 Comments khilaadi kumaar ne video main kaha ki unke jaise public figure to aisa kar lete hai, unhone khud kai baar shaheedon ke parijanon kii madad kii he lekin aam log chaahakar bhi aisa nahin kar pate
 Akshay posted his video through his Twitter and Facebook account
 post ko twitor par kai like aae or video viral ho gaya
 The ministry was also interested in his suggestion
 vaise jis tarah bheed akshay ko dekhne north block main umadi usase saafe lagata he ki akshay suraksha balon ke bhi hero hai
 a CISF jawan said, 'akshay is doing a really good job
 ' The employees of North Block were also eager to catch a glimpse of Akshay
 kendriya grih sachiv ke daphtar ke baahar bheed lag gai
 a girl whom security personnel were removing said, 'I have seen all her films
 ' koi uske saath photo khinchne aayaa to koi phool dene
 Several girls lined up outside the North Block to meet Akshay Kumar
 bheed ko dekhte hue akshay kumaar ko pichley daravaaje se baahar nikaalnaa padaa
 Security was also tightened in view of the enthusiasm of the crowd
 vaise bheed ko dekhte hue andaaza laga sakate hai ki suraksha ke galiyaron main bhi unke kitne fain hai
 The staff of the Union Home Secretary's office was also photographed with Akshay
 vaise suraksha galiyaaron main jab unke itane mureed hai to unki pahal shaayad rang laaegi
 Khiladi Kumar said in the video that a public figure like him does this, he himself has helped the families of the martyrs many times but the common people are unable to do so even if they want to
 akshay ne apane twitor or fasebuk acount se apana video post kiya
 The post received many likes on Twitter and the video went viral
 unke is suzav par mantralay ne bhi dilchaspee lee
 By the way, the crowd gathered in North Block to see Akshay, it seems clear that Akshay is also a hero of the security forces
 siaisef ke ek jawan ne kaha, 'akshay sach main acha kaam kar rahe hai
 ' north block ke karmchaaree bhi akshay kii jhalak dekhne ko betaab dikhe
 There was a crowd outside the Union Home Secretary's office
 ek ladki jise suraksha karmi hataa rahe the ne kaha, 'maine uski sari filme dekhi he
 'if someone came to take a photo with him, someone would give flowers
 kai ladkiyaan akshay kumaar se milane ke liye north block ke baahar phool lekar khadi ho gayi
 Seeing the crowd, Akshay Kumar had to be thrown out the back door
 bheed kaa josh dekhte hue suraksha bhi kadi kar di gai
 By looking at the crowd, you can guess how many fans they have in the security corridors as well
 kendriya grih sachiv ke daftar kaa staff bhi akshay ke saath photo khinchaate hue dikhaa
 By the way, when he has so many wishes in the security corridors, his initiative will probably bring color
 vaise bheed ko dekhte hue andaaza laga sakate hai ki suraksha ke galiyaron main bhi unke kitne fain hai
 The staff of the Union Home Secretary's office was also photographed with Akshay
 vaise suraksha galiyaaron main jab unke itane mureed hai to unki pahal shaayad rang laaegi

 Regarding the revelations about the intervention of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) in the Rafale Deal, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari has said that 'parrikar was not aware of the case
 unhone apana pallaa jhaad liya
 They isolated themselves from the case so that if something happens tomorrow, nothing comes over them
 haalanki adaalat main yah baat kitni maani jaaegi, pataa nahin
 He said in a press conference that for the first time it happened that a PM (modi Modi) himself interfered in a defense negotiation
 hamaari chunauti he, koi ek bhi aisa doosraa maamla dikhaa de jisamen piem negoshiation main shaamil hue hon
 We have a lot of respect for the post of Prime Minister, but since the papers have appeared since morning, it seems as if the PM or PMO is acting like a middleman in this matter
 tiwari ne kah ki kal chaukeedaar ne hawa main khub laathiyaan chalaayin lekin aaj subah chaukeedaar kii asaliyat saamne aa gai
 Every effort has been made by the government to hide the facts, but this known truth is revealed
 jab sach saamne aayaa to sarkaar ne ghabrahat main apane bachaav main kuch paper saamne rakhe
 But these papers are implicating PM more than ever
 note main saaf he ki dephence ministry ne koi aisa input nahin diya tha ki bank guarantee kii jarurat nahin hogi
 But despite this, how and on what basis did the PMO give confidence to the French authorities about the agreement without bank guarantee? The Congress leader said that the Defense Minister wrote in the note 'it appears' meaning they did not know what was going on
 
 ve andaja laga rahe hai
 The Defense Minister clearly avoided the matter

 Never in the history of 70 years has the PM or his office directly negotiated a deal
 aisa lag rahaa he ki pradhanmantri kisi bichauliye kai tarah vyavhaar kar rahe the
